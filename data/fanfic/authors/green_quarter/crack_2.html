<!-- I Can Crack All Your Ribs But I Can't Break Your Heart \ Part 2 -->

<p>Brooke was mentally running through her homework assignments when she
opened her locker at the end of the day. She almost didn't notice the
page of loose-leaf, folded twice, that fluttered to the floor.
Picking it up and glancing at it, she immediately saw that it was in
Josh's handwriting. She leaned against the locker next to her own
and began to read. After one paragraph, she could hear her heart
beating loudly in her veins. After the second, she lifted her eyes
from the page and surveyed her surroundings, holding the letter close
to her chest.</p>
<p>There was nothing out of the ordinary in the hallway; it was filled
with the usual throng of students preparing to go home or sauntering
off to their extracurricular activities. Josh was nowhere in sight.
When Brooke saw Sam negligently slouched against a wall next to Lily's
locker, she could've sworn that the girl had been watching her. But a
moment later Sam pushed away from the wall and walked with Lily past
Brooke without meeting her eyes.</p>
<p>This was no place for something so personal, in front of prying eyes,
but Brooke could not help herself. She turned to face the inside of
her locker and started reading from the beginning again.</p>
<i>
<p>Dear Brooke,</p>
<p>I have made an unforgivable mistake. It is a mistake of my own
making, and I am the one who continues to pay for it. I have let you
slip from my fingers. Everyday I see you, your beauty etched in sharp
relief among a sea of amorphous faces, and I am reminded of what I
had, and what I've lost. I imagine us, somewhere in our past or
future, when the sun rises and sets on our happiness.</p>
<p>After so much time, I am making an overture now. It has taken a while
to gather the courage to do this. You are the standard to which I
set all others, and I feel I should try one more time before I am
resigned to a lifetime of second best. I have to know if there is
any part of your heart that is still warm for me, like a rock that
holds the heat of the day long after it has ended.</p>
<p>I wish you could see me. Really see me. The person you look upon is
so different than the person I am. If I could find a way to strip
away all the assumptions, the preconceptions, the expectations in
which we have bundled ourselves, our emotional Gore-Tex, maybe we
could see each other as we really are. I'm willing to leave myself
open to the elements if it will allow you a glimpse of the truth. Can
you see me with new eyes?</p>
<p>This letter is wholly inadequate for its purpose. I can hardly expect
a slim piece of paper to move mountains. But the words on this page
are just a few of the many I have to say, and it's not a mountain I
have to move. So I will continue to use words, hoping to find the
ones that will shift your wise, skeptical heart just enough for you to
see me. I will be here. Until that day I remain</p>
<p>Yours,
Josh</p>

<p>"Brooke, why are you wedged halfway into your locker?" Nicole Julian
sounded affronted by the image of Brooke looking less than dignified.</p>
<p>"I thought I smelled something weird," Brooke explained, stepping away
from her locker, "can you smell it?" She pushed her friend's head into
the small metal space while she swiftly slid the letter into her
handbag. It was private, not for Nic's eyes. Well, not yet, anyway.</p>
<p>"Ew! That is so foul," Nicole retreated with her hand over her nose,
then looked at Brooke with suspicion. "Wait. I didn't smell anything."</p>
<p>"Neither did I," Brooke grinned. "False alarm." She gathered her
glamazon gear and headed down the hallway. "Are you coming to practice?"</p>
<p>On their way outside, Brooke hastily revised the agenda for today's
practice, substituting a nice long distance run for the team drills
she had planned. The squad grumbled as they hit the track, but Brooke
already had her ear buds in place and didn't hear.</p>
<p>The pounding of snare and bass along with a spare, tight guitar riff
flooded her bones as she fingered the volume control to the maximum.
Lately this song got her so pumped when she was working out; she
didn't think she'd ever get tired of it. Somewhere in her brain the
lyrics registered: 'Oh, tryin' to let it go, tryin' to keep my eyes
closed...' Brooke stood up after an abbreviated stretching routine and
took off at a blistering speed, pushing herself for several laps until
she eased into a pace she could maintain for the duration of her run.
Sneakers striking the asphalt in time to the drums, pulse hammering
at her wrists, chest heaving, she finally reached the place where her
mind was detached enough to think about Josh's letter.</p>
<p>The poetic heartfelt language - he certainly had her attention. Josh
had never been one to write real love letters, but she still had a few
of the notes he had passed her in class from the early, innocent days
of their courtship locked away in her keepsake box. It seemed so long
ago now, and only served to highlight the difference between those
childish notes and the mature, poignant missive she had found in her
locker today.</p>
<p>She had no idea Josh had it in him to write something so moving, all
his hard work this semester was paying off. Although something about
the letter bothered her. It was lacking one of Josh's best qualities,
his sweetness, and the intensity in tone was antithetical to his
easy-going nature. Had Josh really changed that much? And did she
have anything to do with the changes in him? It had only been a few
months since their breakup, but the yearning that poured from every
sentence seemed to indicate he had taken it harder than she had ever
imagined.</p>
<p>And why now? Brooke had taken the time since they had split to
process her relationship with Josh and decide what she really needed
and wanted in a boyfriend. Only recently had she felt emotionally
healthy enough to contemplate jumping back into the dating pool, and
had been secretly evaluating candidates who might have partner
potential. Brooke thought she had been ready to move on, to
experience the fun of casual dating. Was another go-round with Josh,
with its built-in weightiness, something to realistically consider, or
should one of them have the guts to pull this thing out by the roots.</p>
<p>But Brooke was unable to deny the visceral effect the letter had on
her. Physiological signals like an elevated heart rate and sweaty
palms as she read it told her that she was not immune to the passion
Josh claimed to have for her. She owed it to herself to see where it
would go, didn't she? Brooke didn't know. Ambivalence made her wary.
Adopting a wait and see approach seemed the best course.</p>
<p>Her playlist, she noticed, had ended. She was the only one still
circling the track. Cheerleaders dotted the infield in small groups,
sitting on green grass waiting for their captain to release them for
the day. Slowing to a leisurely jog, she waved Nic over and told her
to dismiss the troops. They had the California State Competition
coming up next month, it began the day after Thanksgiving, and for
which they were nowhere near ready. Brooke knew she should be pushing
them harder. But not today, there was always tomorrow.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>At dinner, Sam paid particular attention to Brooke, but tried to make
it appear that she wasn't. Her housemate did seem more quiet and
preoccupied, but Sam couldn't tell if it was due to the letter she had
written for Josh or if it was just Brooke's usual policy of barely
acknowledging her existence. Since it was Sam's turn to do the
dishes, Brooke had made her escape up to her room before Sam had the
chance to casually interrogate her.</p>
<p>Sam was burning to know what Brooke had thought of the letter and she
was not above inventing interactions to find out. Water running in
the bathroom told her that Brooke was most likely washing her face
before bed, a process that, for Brooke, was as lengthy as it was
complicated. Who knew so many products could be employed just to keep
one face clean? Sam knocked on the door.</p>
<p>"I'll be out in a minute," was the muffled reply.</p>
<p>"Can I come in and get my floss? It'll just take a second." An
emergency it wasn't, but Sam wasn't about to do something as drastic
as use the toilet in front of Brooke. There were some lines she
wouldn't cross.</p>
<p>Just because Sam couldn't hear Brooke's sigh of exasperation didn't
mean it didn't happen. A moment later she was admitted entry, and she
surreptitiously glanced over at Brooke while she claimed the dental
floss. Brooke was deeply involved in applying some kind of foaming
cleanser to her skin, but Sam thought her housemate could handle the
break in concentration that a conversation would cause.</p>
<p>"Do you mind if I brush my teeth while I'm in here? I think I've got
a popcorn kernel stuck between my molars." Sam pinked slightly, it
was a fine balance between making your story seem real and too much
information, and she thought she had just dipped perilously into TMI
territory.</p>
<p>"Whatever," Brooke muttered.</p>
<p>As Sam took hold of toothpaste and brush, she frowned. How would she
be able to talk if she was foaming at the mouth? Then she got annoyed
with herself, that a simple conversation with Brooke involved so much
forethought and subterfuge. It would have been much easier to write
an inflammatory editorial in the Zapruder and then have a fight about it.</p>
<p>Applying toothpaste to her toothbrush as slowly as humanly possible,
Sam casually asked, "How was your day?"</p>
<p>Shooting Sam a look of bafflement, Brooke replied, "Um, fine."</p>
<p>"Anything interesting happen today?" Sam pressed.</p>
<p>Brooke immediately went on the defensive, suspicion raising her
hackles. "What are you fishing for, Sam? What's your angle?"</p>
<p>"There is no angle," Sam claimed innocently. "We just haven't talked
much lately."</p>
<p>Brooke was getting angry. "Just like we haven't screamed at each
other much lately? Or like we haven't come to blows much lately?
Whatever story you're working on, I'm not going to help you write it!"</p>
<p>"There is no story. I'm trying to get along with you. I just thought
that we could have a normal conversation like two people who live in
the same house may be inclined to do once in a while!"</p>
<p>"You'll have to excuse me if I look on your suggestion with a hint of
incredulity, Sam. You have a pretty lousy track record when it comes
to getting along," Brooke had abandoned her skin care regime to stare
balefully at Sam's reflection in the mirror.</p>
<p>"Forget it!" Sam threw down her toothbrush and made for the door.
"I'm sorry I even tried."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam was up before the sun; after a restless night tossing and turning
it was useless to remain in bed. Nodding to a lone janitor as he sat
outside enjoying a peaceful, pre-bedlam cigarette, she entered the
empty halls of Kennedy High. Her footsteps echoed loudly as she
walked to the newspaper office and let herself in with the key Mr.
Grant had neglected to retrieve from her before he quit.</p>
<p>Writing something, actually putting words on paper, was the only way
she could think of to get this demon out. In her sleepless state the
previous night she had come up with a plan that would exorcise all the
insane notions that had taken root in her cerebellum, and she would
have to bring all her literary talents to bear on the result. It
would be totally worth abandoning her journalistic integrity if she
was able to pull this off.</p>
<p>For the first time in her life, Sam was going to invent a story. It
would be a tale of such hellacious, rapacious, sordid, wrathful
scandal it would make Lewinsky-gate look like Romper Room. And Brooke
was going down. Sam was going to bury her. Once and for all, she was
going to pull Brooke from her golden popular pedestal and force her to
live in ostracized obscurity with the rest of the common people.</p>
<p>She didn't have the goods on Brooke so she was going to manufacture
them, which wasn't going to be easy. She had no experience with
fiction and had no notion of what kind of tale to tell. Booting up
one of the computers, she sat in front of a blank Word document and
waited for inspiration to strike. It didn't. After ten minutes of
resisting the urge to play FreeCell, Sam had an idea. She
double-clicked a folder on the desktop labeled "Ricky," which
contained all recent photos taken by the paper's photographer,
unsurprisingly named Ricky. He would often come in after a school
event and plug his digital camera into the USB port and dump his
images into the folder, returning later to view and choose the ones
that could be considered for layout. Sam remembered him coming in
Monday morning, transferring the pictures he had taken from Friday
night's football game. Knowing Ricky's so-called "artistic"
appreciation of the female form, Sam guessed the cheerleaders would be
well represented.</p>
<p>She wasn't wrong. A hair trigger finger clicked rapidly through
endless shots of uncompleted passes and T-formations until she reached
the halftime photos. There, among arty shots of the marching band's
brass section were several close-ups of the cheerleaders on the
sidelines, their backs to the gridiron as they attempted to entertain
the crowd. There had to be an image of Brooke on which Sam could
fixate, a photo that would surely remind her of how rotten and evil
and arrogant Brooke was, one that would inspire the levels of
revulsion needed to come up with a truly shocking article for the
Zapruder Reporter.</p>
<p>And there it was. Ricky had outdone himself. An image, shot from a
low angle, appeared on the screen. The open-limbed pose displayed a
body that was at rest, but either just finished or about to start
moving. It sent a message of power and strength and joy. Lean Legs,
defined by planes of muscle, were held slightly apart, ending in
firmly planted white Jack Purcells on the track surface. Slim and
strong arms were upraised, fists clenched, suggesting force and focus.
Brooke's face was caught in an expression of breathless pleasure,
open mouthed and smiling, her eyes delighted at the response of the
unseen crowd. Her cheeks were healthily flushed and her hair swished
at an angle behind her, not having caught up with her arrested motion.</p>
<p>Sam opened the picture in Photoshop and cropped it so that it became a
close-up of Brooke's head and shoulders. Saving the new image, she
moved it to the right of the desktop before resizing her Word window
so that it could sit next to the photo without obscuring it. She
leaned in close to the monitor, intently gazing at the million or so
pixels that made up Brooke's face for a moment. Then she began to type.</p>
<p>Locker doors slamming with increasing frequency and youthful voices
raised in greeting a short time later told Sam that she would not be
alone in the Zapruder office for much longer. She sat back in her
chair and quickly read what she had written. The words had been
expelled from her with a swiftness that was annoying. Precisely
pinning her thoughts was usually as difficult as collecting falling
raindrops with an eyedropper, but the page before her had flowed with
the ease of pouring water into a glass. She was glad to have it all
purged from her mind, but sooner or later she would have to deal with
the emotions that inspired her words. Sighing in resignation, Sam
pasted the text of her document into her email program, attached the
cropped image of Brooke to it, and sent it to herself. Then she typed
Josh's name at the bottom of the document and printed it before
deleting the file. If she was going to make a habit of writing love
letters to Brooke McQueen, someone should at least get the benefit of
it.</p>
