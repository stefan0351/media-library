<!-- Fake Plastic Trees \ Part Three -->

<p>Sam and I had to practically sign our lives away to get permission to take the video equipment home with us.  I was learning a bit more about the camera, and Sam had for once relinquished her talon-like grip on controlling things and had let me set up the interview with my dad and Jane however I wanted.</p>

<p>I had moved the sectional sofa against the wall and had placed the camera facing the loveseat, where the ?rents were now sitting, patiently waiting to start.  A few bright lights were needed this time, as the room was pretty dim.  I was sitting on the couch, going over my notes, while Sam finished setting up the microphone and gave the viewfinder a final check.  She appeared satisfied, and started the tape.  "Okay, Brooke, we?re rolling.  Any time you?re ready."  She sat down on the sofa, a few feet away from me, the tripod set up between us.</p>

<p>I cleared my throat and put on my best Barbara Walters, tear-inducing, sympathetic expression.  "I thought we?d start with a little background first.  Jane, could you tell us a little about your life before you met my father, I mean, Mike McQueen?"</p>

<p>Jane sat up and leaned forward a little, and Sam instantly hopped to her feet and checked the focus.</p>

<p>"Well," Jane began, "I got married relatively young.  Joe McPherson was my high school sweetheart, and the two of us attended the same college.  When we graduated we saw no reason to wait, so we eloped.  We were young and in love.  Joe was an extremely talented writer, and got a job in the newsroom at the Los Angeles Times.  I started working for a commercial real estate company in an administrative capacity while I studied for my real estate license.  Joe?s star at the paper began to rise, and he began to receive some good assignments for someone so young.  He was happy and very fulfilled in his work, he would come home and tell me every detail about his day."  Jane stopped for a moment and smiled wistfully.</p>

<p>I looked over at Sam, but her face was turned away from me and I couldn?t see her expression.</p>

<p>"A few years later I got pregnant with Sam, and although I liked my job and was doing pretty well, Joe was doing well enough at the paper that I didn?t have to work after she was born.  I was so happy.  We were so happy.  Sam was our joy, even when she was screaming blue murder at 3AM," Jane grinned.  "I honestly believed that I had reached the ?And they lived happily ever after? part of the story.  And for many years, we were content in our lives.  Joe and I raised Sam, who was happy and healthy, if not a little obstinate and willful at times, but she was beautiful and feisty and smart and I was thrilled at the person she was becoming."  I saw Jane look over at Sam, who was looking back at her mother, an embarrassed smile on her face.</p>

<p>"But what happens after ?happily ever after??" Jane asked rhetorically, sighing sadly.  "The fairy tales leave it vague for a reason, I now believe.  Joe got sick, and was taken from us so, so quickly as the cancer ravaged his body."  Jane paused, and blinked back the tears that threatened to fall.  My father placed his hand on Jane?s back in silent support.</p>

<p>Once again I looked over at Sam, who didn?t appear to be paying attention, she was just looking absentmindedly towards the kitchen.  My heart broke to think of her happy family devastated by the whims of fate.</p>

<p>After Jane had regained her composure, she continued.  "I went back to work, residential real estate, this time, and Sam and I carried on.  Life has a way of forcing you to keep living.  I thought that I was done with romantic attachments, and was not looking to replace Joe.  Then I went on that cruise that Sam had persuaded me to take, and I met Mike."  Jane and my father looked at each other and smiled. </p>

<p>"Sometimes things happen that you?re not prepared for, that you could never predict, and I think those are the best moments in life," Jane went on.  "If you can leave yourself open to the unexpected, and not close yourself off because the timing?s not right, or you can?t see yourself in a certain situation, or whatever reason your subconscious can come up with, than you?ll be happier."  Jane?s philosophy was laid out simply, and made every kind of sense.  How did she get to be so wise? </p>

<p>I noticed that Sam was now paying fierce attention to her mother.  She had leaned forward and was resting her elbows on her knees, and propped her head in her hands, turning her ferociously attentive gaze towards her mother, her brow furrowed in concentration.</p>

<p>"I was so unhappy, and now I?m not," she said, with understatement, reaching for my dad?s hand.  "Your father and I knew that bringing you girls into this situation was not going to be easy, but we didn?t think you would want to begrudge us our happiness.  It comes along so infrequently.  We thought that you were mature enough that, in time, you could see that we weren?t doing it to make your lives miserable.  I know it?s been hard on both of you, and I think it?s great that you can work together on a project like this, maybe it means things are improving," she finished hopefully, looking at me expectantly. </p>

<p>Everything Jane had said was true.  I wanted my dad to be happy, how could I not?  And there was no question that Jane made him happy. </p>

<p>"Mom, that was awesome, but could you guys answer the questions like you were talking to an impartial interviewer?  We don?t want them to know we?re talking to our own parents," Sam said.</p>

<p>"Oh," Jane looked a little surprised.  "Sure, Sam."</p>

<p>I rolled my eyes.  I didn?t think it really mattered one way or the other, as long as we got the thing submitted in time, but whatever perfectionist Sam wanted.</p>

<p>"Brooke, are you ready with your next question?" Sam prompted me.    </p>

<p>I nodded at Sam and turned to my father.  "Your turn, Mr. McQueen, could you tell us a little about your previous marriage?"  I smiled and hoped he felt comfortable.  "Could you answer the same question?  What was life like before Jane?"</p>

<p>"Kelly and I met in college," my father began.  "We had come from similar backgrounds in that we were both very much the product of our upbringing.  I was raised with certain expectations in place from the time I was very young, and had never really thought to question them.  After college, I was going to be groomed to eventually take over the family firm, and as such had to acquire the trappings that a pillar of society possessed." </p>

<p>I knew all about my dad?s business, and how he had worked really hard after my grandpa died to keep things going, but he was talking about it like it was something he didn?t want, which surprised me. </p>

<p>"Kelly?s parents raised her to become a society wife, plain and simple."  Mike continued, "Even at that time, it was a somewhat old-fashioned way to think, but Kelly loved her parents, and didn?t see any reason to disappoint them.  My fraternity and her sorority were often thrown together for mixers and parties, and we found each other, two people whose idea of the future seemed to mesh pretty well.  We dated all through college, and both our families wholeheartedly approved of the match, so we threw a huge wedding right after graduation, which made the society pages, of course. </p>

<p>"I threw myself into my work, and was able to find satisfaction in that, but Kelly didn?t have much to keep her occupied, and soon became dissatisfied with her life.  I encouraged her to find an interest and take classes, volunteer, anything that would make her happy.  Plus, I had hoped that we would start a family and she would find fulfillment in that.  She discovered photography, and had a real gift for it, but it only seemed to be a way to fill the hours to her. </p>

<p>"Then we had Brooke, and things were better for a while," Dad looked at me and smiled.</p>

<p>Even though I knew how this story was going to end, it was still starting to get me upset.  And my father had not mentioned the one word that I had been waiting to hear.  He continued talking about me and how much joy I had brought to his life and how happy I made him, but I had to know and I interrupted him.  "Dad, what about love?  Did you and mom love each other?"</p>

<p>He looked at me for a little while before answering, and I felt Jane and Sam?s eyes on me as well.</p>

<p>"I think that if your mother and I had been smart enough to ask ourselves what would have made us happiest when we were young, instead of blindly following the expectations of others, we would not have gotten married," my father said gravely, watching me closely.  "If there is one thing I want to impart to you, Brooke, it is that you must look inside yourself and do what will make you happy, without thought or consideration to how people will perceive you.  None of that matters; please, don?t make the same mistake your mother and I made."</p>

<p>My father was basically saying that he and my mother had never really loved each other.  And even after he laid out all the reasons why, I was still asking myself why the fuck had they done it.  He had an uncomfortable look on his face, like he knew he had said too much.  But we had asked them to be honest, and honest he had been.  The silence stretched out, and I realized that I needed to ask another question, but the words were not coming, as there was a lump in my throat roughly the size of an SUV.  I took a breath and thumbed through my cards, trying to get a hold of myself, when I felt a hand on my shoulder, and I turned to see Sam looking sympathetically at me. </p>

<p>"We don?t have to finish this now," she said quietly.</p>

<p>"Yes, we do," I said determinedly, and swiped at my face, although my eyes were dry. </p>

<p>"Honey, you know that your mother and I -" my father interjected.</p>

<p>"It?s okay, Dad," I said forcefully, cutting him off.  If I had to hear him paying lip service to the fact that they both loved me one more time I thought I would scream.  I thrust my notecards towards Sam.  "Here.  Keep going.  I?ll be back in a minute."</p>

<p>As I left the room I heard Sam smoothly direct the next question to my father, asking him about some of the logistical problems about combining households, effectively moving the interview away from the emotional minefield it had become.  I went outside and sat on the deck, taking in deep lungfuls of the evening air, thinking about my place in the mess that was my parents? fucked up relationship.  I supposed that I had been a band-aid to their failing marriage, a way to try and bring them together that had ultimately failed.  And there I had been, innocently caught in the middle.  I didn?t know why it was making me so upset; I had been through all of this before, why did she still have the power to make me so unhappy?  But it wasn?t just her; it was him, too.  I was pissed at them for being too stupid to realize that they never should?ve gotten together.  But then what would have become of me if they hadn?t?  Would I have just not ever existed?  That was a question for the fucking ages.</p>

<p>The way I saw it, I had two choices.  I could continue to allow them to have power over me by doing stupid destructive things like starving myself down to the weight of an eight-year-old, or get over it and move on, and acknowledge the fact that their idiot choices don?t have anything to do with me.  This was all very easy to think about but actually putting it into practice would be another matter entirely.  I would just have to keep it in mind.  But now I didn?t want to think about it anymore. </p>

<p>I returned to the living room to find Sam wrapping it up.  She was thanking my dad and Jane for participating, trying to sound like Tom Brokaw or someone equally commanding, but instead sounding for all the world like the reincarnation of Chevy Chase in the news segment of Saturday Night Live.  It was actually pretty funny, but I wasn?t in the mood to laugh.</p>

<p>As soon as Sam turned off the tape, my dad jumped up and ran over to me, pulling me into a hug. </p>

<p>"I?m sorry, Brooke," he said.</p>

<p>"Don?t be silly, daddy," I replied brightly, my voice sounding hard and hollow, "you were just telling the truth, which is exactly what we asked you to do."</p>

<p>"Are you okay?" he asked, looking into my eyes with concern.</p>

<p>"I?m fine."  I looked over to where Sam and her mom stood, watching our exchange with matching somber expressions.  Jane had her arm around Sam, and it gave me a pain to think of the loving relationship Sam had with her mother.</p>

<p>For reasons I could not fathom, I moved away from my father and pulled Sam by the arm away from her mother.  Sam allowed herself to be pulled, a puzzled look on her face.  I gripped her tightly around the shoulder, pulling her close as we stood side by side.  I just couldn?t handle the image of Sam standing so close to her mother; I needed her here next to me.  "Jane, Dad, thanks for participating in this interview," I parroted the words Sam had used.  "We are going to clean this stuff up and then we?re leaving.  Sam is going to be my date for the Radiohead concert tonight."</p>

<p>Sam gave me a strange look, but didn?t say anything.  She probably thought I would dissolve into a puddle of tears if she had objected, which there was no telling, maybe I would have.  And I was back to calling it a date, I noted, even though it certainly was anything but that.  Since I had come back into the room, it felt like there was a high-pitched hum running through my brain, and I almost asked if anyone else could hear it.  I felt off-balance and oddly unsettled, like you get when you see the lightning in the distance and are waiting for the sound of thunder to catch up.</p>

<p>That?s nice, Brooke, good, I?m glad," my father babbled, still looking anxiously at me.</p>

<p>Sam reached up and pried my fingers from her shoulder with some effort.  "We don?t have to go if you don?t want to," she said.</p>

<p>Was she trying to get out of it?  She had better not be.  "NO." I said vehemently.  "We are going."  </p>

<p>I had to get out of this house, and I didn?t want to go alone.  I went over to the outlet and unplugged the camera and DAT recorder.  "Come on, let?s get this stuff put away," I said to Sam, wishing we were already gone.</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>A little while later, Sam and I burst out the front door, finally free for the night.  It hadn?t taken long to get everything packed up, and then to change into clothes more appropriate for a concert, but Sam had taken about five minutes to my half hour, and had patiently waited in the kitchen for me.  When I walked into the kitchen and saw her in her Radiohead t-shirt that she had bought at the previous show she had been to, it was all I could do not to call her the nerd she obviously was.  But who was I to judge, I didn?t know what to wear either and that was what had taken me so long.</p>

<p>Sam had been chatting with her mom while she waited for me, but got up when she saw me.  "Okay, Mom, we?re going," she said.</p>

<p>"Wait, do you girls want me to make you a sandwich or something before you go?" Jane asked.</p>

<p>"No, Mom, we?re already late," Sam replied, then looked at me.  "You ready?"</p>

<p>I nodded and said goodnight to Jane.</p>

<p>"Have fun on your date, girls," Jane said, chuckling at the very idea.</p>

<p>"Not funny, Mom," Sam scowled, and stomped to the front door.</p>

<p>But her scowl was replaced by a look of suspicion when I handed her my keys in the driveway. </p>

<p>"We?ll take my car, but you drive, okay?"  I headed for the passenger side, while Sam just stood there dumbly.</p>

<p>"You never let me drive your car," she said.</p>

<p>"Well I am tonight, so get in before I change my mind," I replied.  "Come on, Sam, you said we were already late."</p>

<p>Sam shrugged and got in.  The truth was that I just didn?t want to face the traffic on the one ten that we would be sure to encounter on our way downtown.  I just wanted to sit in silence and not think about anything, and maybe being occupied at the wheel would keep Sam quiet.  And it did, she didn?t try to make conversation as we made our way to our destination.  I was feeling brittle and breakable, a dozen moods rotating through my brain like scenes from a viewmaster.  In quick succession I felt relief at being out of the house, sorrow for my parents loveless marriage, confusion over my father?s advice to me, and annoyance with Sam as all my faculties zoomed in to focus on her index finger tapping on the steering wheel.  Although it couldn?t have been making more than a hushed tap as it struck the leather that encased the wheel, in my mind her finger had taken on the decibel level of a sledgehammer being repeatedly struck against corrugated tin, and I glared at it, willing it to be still.</p>

<p>Sam glanced over at me and noticed my insane staring and desisted.  "Sorry," she mumbled.  She had obviously picked up on my fragile mental state and had turned off the radio and concentrated on the road as I curled up on the passenger seat and looked out the window.  Now that we had slowed down on the congested freeway, the bored people in the surrounding cars had been looking back at me, and had begun to freak me out, so I turned to face Sam and looked at her profile as she navigated the stop and go traffic.  It really was nice of her not to demand to be paid attention to, as I would surely be having to do if it were anyone else in the car.  I could not see Nic or Mary Cherry picking up on my black mood and willingly allowing me the time to surface from it on my own. </p>

<p>She noticed me studying her and looked over and smiled uncertainly, seemingly trying to gauge where my head was at.  I decided to let her know I wouldn?t bite her head off if she spoke in my presence.  I turned on the radio to hear the latest hip-hop clone act going on about bitches and hos, as usual.  Why did LA radio suck so bad, I wondered.  I turned it off again and looked in the armrest and glove box for any CD?s I might have left around, but didn?t find anything that would put me in the mood for Radiohead.  I sighed and looked at Sam.  "I got nothing.  You didn?t happen to bring any CD?s with you, did you?"  At Sam?s wordless headshake I said, "Well I guess it?s unavoidable, we?re going to have to talk to each other."</p>

<p>Sam nodded but didn?t say anything.</p>

<p>"So why do you think all the radio stations in Los Angeles suck, Sam?"</p>

<p>"You mean why do they suck besides for the fact that nearly all the stations have been bought out by one massive corporation, that doesn?t care about putting anything unique or interesting on the air but is only concerned with making a profit?  Or the mindless tools they hire to program and DJ at said commercial stations who would rather keep their cushy job than go against corporate policy and play something other than the five internally mandated sucky songs that are in heavy rotation? Or the way that when you turn your radio on randomly at any given time you are more likely to hear an ad than a song?  Or because this is such a large urban market that the stations try to appeal to the lowest common denominator, shoving the blandest, the most by-the-numbers, most monotonous music down our throats in an effort to keep everyone happy, and thus pleasing no one?"  Sam either had run out of breath or out of ideas, I guess it didn?t matter which.</p>

<p>"Yeah, besides that," I grinned.</p>

<p>"Haven?t the faintest idea," Sam smiled back.</p>

<p>And that was all it took.  She had done it.  Thoughts of my parents had left and I was back in the moment and happy about it.  I should have let Sam open her mouth sooner.  I chuckled at her goofy response and shook my head.  I looked out the window to hide the huge grin that had suddenly come upon my face, having no way to explain my extreme mood swings.  Maybe I was going through menopause.  Nah, too young.  I looked into the car next to me as we were at a standstill and couldn?t believe what I saw.</p>

<p>"Sam, look at that guy," I discreetly pointed to the car in the next lane. </p>

<p>Sam leaned forward and looked past me.  We both watched as the guy shoved his pinky way up his left nostril, digging for gold.</p>

<p>"Oh my god," Sam breathed.  "Does he think he has a force field or something around his lame little Civic that prevents us from seeing his dirty disgusting habits?  He must have an itch in his brain he?s trying to scratch."</p>

<p>Maybe he left something up there like his house key or a ficus plant or something," I giggled.</p>

<p>"Should we out him?"  Sam asked, raising her eyebrow and grinning evilly at me.  "Obviously his mother failed him if he?s picking his nose practically in public like this.  He should have tinted windows if he?s going to indulge in socially offensive behavior of this kind."</p>

<p>Sam waited for my input.  Sometimes you just got all caught up in your own little world when you were driving, I kind of felt bad for the guy.  On the other hand, he was plainly visible to anyone driving on Route 110, Southbound, and it would be totally hilarious.  I looked at her and nodded, praying he didn?t have a gun.</p>

<p>My window instantly started coming down, Sam?s finger had been poised on the control at her side.  She started honking and pointing towards the guy, yelling "Nosepicker!!" and other choice pejoratives at him.</p>

<p>But the guy was oblivious, closed up in his car with the radio on.  I started yelling too, and waving my arms, but the guy leaned over and changed the radio station or something, pulling his finger from his nose.  When he straightened up again he noticed the two of us acting like monkeys at the zoo, but I guess he couldn?t make out what we were saying, and he actually smiled and waved, then pulled his car ahead ten feet.</p>

<p>The two of us lost it, cackling like a couple of witches doped up on nitrous oxide.</p>

<p>"How frustrating is that?"  Sam asked after she could breathe again.  "Foiled in our judgmental attempt to bring basic hygiene and good manners to America?s roadways."</p>

<p>"So frustrating," I agreed. </p>

<p>"We?re going to hell," Sam commented casually.</p>

<p>"Probably," I responded, not the least bit worried about it.</p>

<p>Inexplicably, our lane started to move, and we passed the guy again, but he wasn?t doing anything more offensive than sipping from a Starbucks cup just then.  We finally got past the congestion and began to pick up speed, my hair was ruffled in the breeze coming in the open window, and I heard the whooshing sound as we passed the cars in the next lane over that meant we were actually getting somewhere.  Sam was about to raise my window again when I told her no, and aimed my face directly into the evening breeze.  It felt good against my skin, and although I squinted into the increasing wind, I couldn?t stop the tears that escaped from the corners of my eyes, and trickled back horizontally towards my ears.  Whether they were tears of sadness, or happiness, or merely wind-induced I couldn?t say, but I preferred to designate them tears of contentment.  And I almost forgot to remember that the girl beside me didn?t like me at all.</p>
