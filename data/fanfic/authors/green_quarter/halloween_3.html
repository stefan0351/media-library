<!-- Halloween \ Part Three -->

<p>A little later, Brooke stepped outside and saw that Sam's Beetle wasn't in the driveway. She must have taken my advice and went back out to look for a costume, Brooke surmised. She herself was taking the short walk three doors down to Harrison's. There were a few things she needed to clarify.</p>
<p>Harrison opened the door after she rang the bell, his face expressionless. "Hi Brooke," he said, without emotion.</p>
<p>"Hi, Harrison," Brooke replied. There was an awkward pause. "Do you think I could come in? I need to talk to you."</p>
<p>Harrison silently moved away from the door and waited for Brooke to step through. He then led her into his room, kept as neatly as ever, Brooke noticed. She sat on the bed while Harrison turned his desk chair to face her and sat down.</p>
<p>"So, what's up, Brooke?" Harrison asked.</p>
<p>"How are you doing?" Brooke answered with another question. She wasn't sure how to bring up what she wanted to talk about.</p>
<p>"I'm great. School's fine, and my golf swing is improving. My girlfriend dumped me, but at least I still have my health," he responded sarcastically.</p>
<p>Brooke flinched. She guessed she deserved that. But their last conversation had been cordial, and she thought their parting was amicable. Prolonging this any further was not an option. "When we were having our..." Brooke paused, unsure how to continue.</p>
<p>"When you broke up with me?" Harrison supplied.</p>
<p>"Yes. When we were talking you said that it was Sam's fault we were breaking up." Brooke watched Harrison nod his head like he had been waiting for this. "I'm not sure I know what you meant by that. Did you mean that you want to go out with her now?"</p>
<p>"No, Brooke, that's not what I meant," Harrison sighed. "Even if I wanted to, I doubt she would want me after I chose you over her." He looked at the floor for a long moment before continuing. Things had been festering in him since last week and he had to let them out. "Did you know that whenever we hung out in your room, you always talked a little bit louder so Sam would know we were in there?"</p>
<p>Brooke's mouth opened in surprise.</p>
<p>"Do you realize that whenever I picked you up to go out you would parade me around your house so that Sam would see us? And when we were in the same room as Sam, you were always watching her to see what her reaction was to us? Do you even know how that made me feel, Brooke?" Harrison cried. "It was very subtle, but I noticed it from the beginning. When you couldn't get a rise out of Sam, I thought it would stop. Only that's when you started to lose interest in me. Or what I represented."</p>
<p>"What you represented?" Brooke repeated, dumbly.</p>
<p>"The trophy in your contest with Sam." Harrison finished, bleakly.</p>
<p>Brooke sat there, speechless and stunned. He was right. Why did she do all of that? She didn't even know she was doing it, on any conscious level. But Harrison called her on it, and she knew it was true. He had every right to feel used. "Harrison, I am so sorry. Why did I do those things?" she asked helplessly.</p>
<p>"I don't know, Brooke," Harrison replied, but the look in his eyes made her think that he did know.</p>
<p>Brooke slowly made her way back home, lost in thought. She went over the events of the last months in her mind. She was utterly baffled as to why she would act that way. What was to be gained by throwing her relationship in Sam's face constantly? Was she really that petty, that she would flaunt her victory in the face of Sam's misery? But Sam wasn't miserable about it. She had confessed to Brooke that the only reason she engaged in the competition for Harrison was for the competition itself. So why hadn't Brooke acknowledged that she had done the same. Why drag Harrison into this charade? She really liked Harrison, but was that the reason she set out to win his affection? If she was honest with herself for once in her stupid life, the answer was no.</p>
<p>Brooke rationalized that the whole thing had snowballed out of control. How could she walk away after all the work she put into chasing Harrison? She had felt jubilant the night of the prom, when she both avoided a near-accident, and got the guy, too. But she knew she was kidding herself. She hadn't stopped to think about what the consequences of her actions would be. What kind of person was she that she would knowingly use someone to make herself look and feel better? Hell, she wasn't Nicole, was she? But she didn't know any of this at the time, a voice said. She was only realizing it now after the fact. That's no excuse. What had she been trying to prove? And to whom was she trying to prove it? Herself? Sam? Why would she need to prove anything to Sam?</p>
<p>All she knew for sure was that Harrison had been a pawn in their game, the game that Sam had stepped away from and refused to play. But Brooke continued to play it instead of owning up to the truth, and had hurt Harrison horribly. She was disgusted with herself.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam returned with her arms full from her triumphant shopping expedition. She had written down a list of addresses from the phone book and had gone from store to store until she found what she didn't know she was looking for. She had amassed quite a collection of bits and pieces along the way, as she entertained and discarded ideas as she went. She found a great dress from the fifties, for the perfect Donna Reed costume, and a candy apple red wig for that Sydney Bristow spy Barbie look, even a construction worker's hardhat and tool belt if she ever wanted to be a member of the Village People. She figured she'd never be unprepared for Halloween again.</p>
<p>But the piece de resistance was found in the last store she visited, of course. She hung it in her closet reverently, and stored the rest still in bags on the closet floor. She went to find Brooke to thank her and tell her about all the cool shops she had been to.</p>
<p>She knocked on Brooke's door but got no reply. She opened it a crack and saw that the room was dim, with Brooke a motionless lump in the middle of her bed. "Brooke?" Sam whispered, but still no response. She quietly closed the door and returned to her own room. She was slightly disappointed to have no one to goof off with, but that only meant that she couldn't put off what she needed to do.</p>
<p>Sam was going to apply her now questionable journalistic and investigatory skills to herself. Too many things lately had not been adding up. She was not behaving like she normally would and she was determined to find out why. Therefore, she was going to interview herself. She sat on her bed with her notebook in her lap in case she needed to record any deep insight that Subject Sam might tell Reporter Sam.</p>
<p>Okay, first question:</p>
<tt>
<p>RS: What's wrong with you, loser?</p>
<p>SS: Hey!</p>
</tt>
<p>Okay, first question, really:</p>
<tt>
<p>RS: What exactly is the nature of your problem?</p>
<p>SS: What is this, therapy?</p>
<p>RS: I'm asking the questions here. I knew you were going to be a hostile subject.</p>
<p>SS: Whatever. My problem is that I have not been myself lately.</p>
<p>RS: And how does this problem manifest itself?</p>
<p>SS: Well, I didn't even notice a major event that happened to Brooke, for one thing. Also, I didn't think of any alternatives for costume-hunting, which is so unlike me. I'm all about alternatives. Brooke had to point it out to me. My moods have been all over the place. I can't concentrate on anything. It's like my brain isn't functioning to full capacity anymore. And I noticed Brooke's ass today.</p>
<p>RS: There seems to be a recurring theme here. Why does Brooke figure so prominently in your problem?</p>
<p>SS: Don't you know this already? You should, I'm having an inner dialogue with myself here.</p>
<p>RS: Humor me.</p>
<p>SS: Fine. Our friendship is relatively new, only a matter of several months. We've always been adversaries before that, competing for everything. Blah biddy blah blah blah. Moving on. But we've been spending a lot of time together, lately. So when she told me about her breakup so long after the fact, it kind of hurt that she didn't trust me or wouldn't confide in me.</p>
<p>RS: So what? Friends don't always tell each other everything.</p>
<p>SS: But I want to be the kind of friend that she trusts. I've changed a lot. I won't compete with her anymore, friends don't do that. They support each other.</p>
<p>RS: Okay, goody-goody. Follow-up question. Why do you want to be the kind of friend she trusts?</p>
<p>SS: Because I like her.</p>
<p>RS: Like her, how?</p>
<p>SS: What do you mean, how?</p>
<p>RS: Would you send her a Christmas card? Would you go bowling with her? Do you want to carry her books? Would you do her taxes for her? Does she make you want to write bad poetry? Would you feed her cold and starve her fever? Would you listen to Mariah Carey for her? Be specific!</p>
<p>SS: Yes! Yes to all of those things. But I also like her because of the 800 different laughs she has. I like the way she brushes her teeth, the way she climbs stairs, the way she hums in the car, and the way she still avoids, to this day, stepping on cracks on the sidewalk. I like how she picks imaginary lint off her clothes. I like how even when she's pissing me off I find her funny. I like how I can't be in a bad mood when I'm around her. And I like her because she's smart, funny, kind, beautiful, etc. Don't get me started on the adjectives; I could go all night. You know me.</p>
<p>RS: Yeah, I do. Girl, you got it bad.</p>
<p>SS: No kidding. But that still doesn't explain why my brain hasn't been working lately.</p>
<p>RS: I think it does. You just made a breakthrough. Just now, you have consciously thought about your feelings for Brooke for the first time. What do you think your subconscious was doing before just now? And it was working overtime, let me tell you.</p>
<p>SS: Huh. Makes sense. So does this mean I'm gay?</p>
<p>RS: Small steps, Grasshopper, small steps. All things in time.</p>
<p>SS: Okay this is getting seriously weird now.</p>
</tt>
<p>Sam started to laugh. She always suspected she was nuts, but now she knew for sure. And she was schizo too, as an added bonus. Or gift with purchase. Because she had bought the king-sized crazy. She felt almost dizzy with the realization. She liked Brooke. She LIKED her, liked her. She maybe even more than liked her, but she was not going to go there yet. That would really be crazy. Crazier. It was so simple, really. Things were starting to make sense now. She felt a rush of euphoria surge through her. Sam wanted to bask in this feeling of happiness. She was surprised that she didn't feel more scared of the revelation. Nothing was fazing her. Not the life-altering knowledge that she might prefer girls, or the fact that the girl in particular she preferred was hopelessly straight, or the vast complications this would bring to her existence. She just wanted to enjoy it.</p>
<p>There was a knock on the door and her mother entered, holding Sam's baby sister Mac in her arms. Jane took in the image of Sam sitting Indian-style on her bed, quietly chuckling with a glazed look in her eyes. The TV wasn't on, her notebook was a blank page in front of her, and there was no evidence of drugs. "What's so funny, Sam?" she asked warily.</p>
<p>"Nothing, Mom," Sam bounded off her bed and grabbed Mac from her mother's arms. "Hiya, Mackie baby. How're you doing?" Sam twirled around the room lifting the baby over her head. "What are you going to be for Halloween, kiddo?" Mac giggled with pleasure.</p>
<p>"Sam, don't get her all whipped into a frenzy," Jane called out nervously. "I'm putting her to bed now, she'll never settle down if you keep doing that."</p>
<p>Suddenly, Brooke's face appeared behind Jane's in the doorway, looking groggy and out of sorts. She blankly took in the domestic scene before her, a frown on her face.</p>
<p>When Sam saw Brooke, her heart lurched.</p>
<p>Jane turned to see what she was looking at. "Oh, Brooke, I'm glad you're here too." She leaned against the doorframe so that she addressed both girls. "Your dad and I want to collect on the other part of our bargain." Sam groaned, she knew dishpan hands or something like it was in her near future. "We need you to clean out the garage, and we want it done before the party."</p>
<p>"Why does it have to be done before the party?" Brooke asked belligerently.</p>
<p>Jane's eyebrows drew together. "Because we're asking you to, Brooke. Besides, it'll be nice to have it clean for the party"</p>
<p>"We're not having the party in the garage," Brooke snippily pointed out.</p>
<p>"You won't have a party at all if it doesn't get done," Jane returned, losing her patience with Brooke. She was bewildered by the hostility of her usually placid stepdaughter.</p>
<p>"It's okay, Mom. We'll do it tomorrow after school," Sam placated, returning Mac to her mother's arms after kissing the baby on the forehead.</p>
<p>"All right," Jane looked at both girls and then nodded. She kissed Sam on the cheek, and then Brooke, and bid them goodnight.</p>
<p>Sam took a deep breath and turned to face Brooke for the first time since her big revelation, but when she looked up, Brooke was gone, and Sam could hear the soft click of her bedroom door closing.</p>
