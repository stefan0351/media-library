<!-- Halloween \ Part Two -->

<p>Sam sat in Physics class the next day, trying to concentrate on vectors, but failing miserably. After last night's giddy-fest with Brooke in her bedroom, she had trouble falling asleep. She turned over the news of Brooke and Harrison's break-up in her mind, worrying the problem like it was a Rubik's cube. Now in class, she was still thinking about it. How could she have failed to notice they had separated? Granted, she had spent every available free minute last week working on an article about corrupt bidding practices for the school's back parking lot paving job, but this was huge news. Even if she had spent every lunch period in the newspaper office last week, wouldn't she have heard the scuttlebutt in the hallways?</p>
<p>She snuck a sidelong glance at Brooke, who appeared to be completely absorbed in Glass' lecture. Brooke didn't look like someone suffering over a painful break-up. She twisted in her seat to get a look at Harrison, who was looking out the window, head resting in the palm of his hand. It had always been hard to tell what Harrison was thinking.</p>
<p>Brooke had long ago perfected the art of seeming attentive in class. To all outward appearances she was the model student, but too often her mind wandered to all sorts of things. Like now, Brooke noticed Sam looking at her, and then at Harrison with a puzzled expression on her face. She took this as confirmation that Sam had indeed not known about the breakup. She had suspected the girl of being less than truthful when she denied knowledge of it, but now realized this was not the case. Brooke could see the wheels turning in Sam's brain, mentally castigating herself for being so unaware. No one could've put on an act for a whole week, pretending not to know something. She didn't know how the girl could be so dense, but she was somewhat relieved that Sam hadn't deceived her. She still felt bad for assuming the worst in Sam. But if she wasn't after Harrison, then why was she being so nice to her? Brooke turned the question around on herself. If she had all these suspicions about Sam, why then had she cultivated the friendship Sam had offered? Harrison said he knew. She didn't know. And thinking about it was doing her head in. She took out a sheet of loose-leaf and wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sam,</p>
<p>Why not be a smurf for Halloween?<br>
It's not too far a stretch from an Oompa-Loompa.<br>
(Stick to what you know.)</p>
<p>Love,<br>
Brooke</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She slid the note over to Sam's side of the lab table with a straight face. Sam looked into Brooke's serious countenance and opened the note. Brooke saw her suppress a grin as she read it before she balled up the note and threw it at her. Brooke couldn't hold back the snort of laughter that escaped as everyone turned to look at them.</p>
<p>"Something funny, McSiblings?" bellowed Glass.</p>
<p>"No, Ms. Glass," Sam answered for the both of them, shooting Brooke a look.</p>
<p>"Well, kindly can it then, please!" Ms Glass narrowed her eyes at the pair before turning back to the blackboard.</p>
<p>Sam sighed with relief at getting off so lightly. She looked at Brooke, who was still chuckling softly to herself, and knew she had to come up with the best costume ever this year. Now, her pride was at stake.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Maybe we should represent the Lollipop Guild," Carmen mused as she held up a Munchkin costume.</p>
<p>"Carmen! You want to go from an Oompa-Loompa to a Munchkin?" Sam demanded in disbelief.</p>
<p>"Even the Lollipop Guild's gotta represent, that's all I'm saying," Carmen replied, flustered, as she returned the costume to the rack. "What's up with you, Sam? You've never freaked out about Halloween before. What's the big deal? Besides, it's two days to Halloween, this place is pretty well picked over." She looked around the busy costume shop with its half-empty racks.</p>
<p>"I know. There's nothing here. What am I going to do? I wanted to have the coolest, sexiest costume this year." Sam whined.</p>
<p>"Don't you think you should have thought of that before the eve of the eve of all Hallows eve?" Carmen had even confused herself with that one. "Anyway, Brooke's got that one covered. She's going to be Trinity."</p>
<p>"Carmen, why didn't you tell me about Brooke and Harrison?" Sam asked, out of nowhere.</p>
<p>After Carmen recovered from the whiplash of the rapid subject change, she calmly said, "Lily and I talked about it, and we thought it would be better coming from Brooke or Harrison themselves. Why? We've been waiting for you to weigh in with an opinion, we thought you just didn't want to talk about it."</p>
<p>"That's just it Carm, neither of them did tell me. I had no idea. I had to open my mouth and insert my foot before Brooke told me last night. God only knows what she thought of that," Sam said, chagrined. "Although it didn't seem to bother her too much."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Sam. We should have told you." Carmen apologized. "And that's just it. They're both walking around like nothing's wrong, so nobody could blame you for not seeing it. You especially, since your head has been in the clouds for weeks, now."</p>
<p>"I'm supposed to be a reporter," Sam said. "I'm supposed to be really astute with the powers of observation thing. And this just went right by me," she said, helplessly.</p>
<p>"Sam, why do you care so much? I mean, it's their problem, right?" Carmen stopped flipping through the rack of costumes and turned to look at Sam. "Unless... You're not going after Harrison, are you?"</p>
<p>"NO. Why does everyone keep asking me that?" Sam cried. "That is all in the past. The only way I want Harrison is as a friend. But he clearly doesn't want me as one, so I've even given up on that."</p>
<p>"Maybe he needs a friend right now, Sam."</p>
<p>"Yeah, maybe," Sam sighed. "So what are we going to do about costumes?"</p>
<p>"I'm kind of digging this flapper outfit. What do you think?" Carmen held up a slinky red and black drop-waisted evening dress, with lots of fringe. "With the right hair and makeup, I could look pretty hot."</p>
<p>Sam smiled and gave her a wolf whistle. "You'll look more than hot, you'll be flapperific," she corn-balled.</p>
<p>Carmen rolled her eyes and laughed. "You want to look for another one? We could both be flappers, if you want," she suggested.</p>
<p>"Nah, I'll think of some other lame thing to be," Sam replied. But no tertiary movie or TV characters of substandard height that require body makeup. Got it?"</p>
<p>Carmen just looked at her like she had finally flipped her lid.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke and Nicole were sitting in the kitchen when Sam returned from the costume store empty-handed.</p>
<p>"What, no costume, Sam?" Brooke asked, innocently. "That smurf idea's looking better and better, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Spam's going to be a smurf? HA!" Nicole had no words.</p>
<p>"I'm NOT going to be a smurf," Sam gritted out, glaring at Brooke, and then Nicole. "Aren't there any small children you could be eating, Satan? Or is it a few days too early for you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, cheer up, hun," Nicole snapped back. "Those eyebrows of yours are scary enough that you don't need a costume." Nicole gathered up her things and looked at Brooke. "Thanks for the water and the mints, Brookie," she patted her stomach. "I think I spoiled my dinner. See you tomorrow. Spam, I think your costume idea is just the smurfiest." The two remaining girls could hear her laughing all the way out to her car.</p>
<p>Sam turned to Brooke and said, "Thanks for that. I just love being a source of amusement for good old Satan."</p>
<p>"Come on, Sam. It was just a joke," Brooke replied. She could tell Sam was only moderately irritated. "Why don't you have a costume? I thought you and Carmen were going shopping?"</p>
<p>"We did. I didn't find anything." Sam sat down at the table. She realized that wanting a sexy costume like Brooke's was just another way of competing with her. Maybe she should be a smurf, she thought to herself, or a flapper with Carmen.</p>
<p>"Hey," Brooke waved her hand in front of Sam's face. "Why so glum, chum?"</p>
<p>"This happens every year," Sam moped. "I wait till the last minute, and then I'm disappointed when there's no good costumes left. Halloween is only my favorite holiday. You'd think I would learn one of these years."</p>
<p>Brooke raised her arm, snapped her fingers and called an imaginary maitre'd over to the kitchen table. "Pity party, table for one, please," she said importantly. "Right this way, madam." She grabbed Sam by the arm and dragged her out of the kitchen and into the hallway.</p>
<p>"Madam? What am I, eighty?" Sam giggled. "Unhand me, young lady! Where are you taking me? If I had an umbrella I'd whack you with it." She marveled at Brooke's ability to charm her, seemingly at will. She was dragged to the console table where the phone book was kept. Brooke pulled it out and leaned over it, then began smacking at the yellow pages.</p>
<p>"Consignment shops. Vintage clothing stores. The Sally Army. Even Goodwill, for pete's sake! Hellooo? Use your resources, Tippy Typewriter! Of course, the costume shops have nothing but mothballs left, but they're not your only options." Brooke looked up at Sam and slid the book in her direction. "So get cracking, Tippy, because I just declared a moratorium on Smurfs at my party." She headed for the stairs</p>
<p>"Your party?" Sam asked incredulously, watching Brooke mount the steps. She got no response from Brooke.</p>
<p>"Brooke?"</p>
<p>Brooke turned around, waiting.</p>
<p>Sam suddenly didn't know what to say. "I really hate being called Tippy Typewriter," was what she came up with. Brooke just smiled at her and continued on her way. Sam watched her ascend and thought to herself, God, she's hot. Wait. What?</p>
