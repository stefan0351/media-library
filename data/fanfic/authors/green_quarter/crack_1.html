<!-- I Can Crack All Your Ribs But I Can't Break Your Heart \ Part 1 -->

<p>Two girls prepared their breakfasts in silence. The kitchen was almost too small to hold them
both. In an intricate ballet of
avoidance they orbited the toaster; one waiting impatiently, frozen waffle in
hand, while the other's bagel slowly cooked between orange coils of heat. An inadvertent glance might slide past a red
cotton sleeve, an earlobe, the weathered rivet on a denim-clad hip - but it
never met the wary features on the face of the other occupant. Like magnets aligned at their poles, the two
girls repelled each other. The opposing forces
they unwittingly exerted insured the distance that kept them at odds. This is how it had always been, ever since
the girls had been forced into each other's field. And as they were also aligned in their mutual aversion,
they exited the kitchen without a word passing between them.</p>
<p>But soon something would happen to cause a pole reversal in one
of the girls, not unlike a magnet when it is flipped to its opposite side. She will be unable to maintain the field
between them, powerless to resist the magnetic pull. What follows is a simple demonstration of scientific
principle: repulsion will turn into attraction.</p>

<p>Sam McPherson entered the school library and searched the
faces of her schoolmates until she found the particular face she was looking
for. Never one to back away from a
difficult situation (especially one of her own making), she purposefully
crossed the room and sat down at a library table across from Kennedy High's
slightly tarnished football hero. "I'm
your tutor," she said sullenly to Josh Ford.</p>
<p>Looking up from the current issue of People magazine into
the eyes of the one who had done the tarnishing, Josh recoiled in disgust. "You?"</p>
<p>"Yes, me. Principal
Krupps forced me to 'volunteer' after the whole GPA expos&#233; thing. He thought it a karmic-ly apt
punishment." Crossed arms and a wry
delivery did little to disguise Sam's discomfort. She had known that her latest article in the
Zapruder had been ethically borderline, but had done it anyway. Just one more instance of her raging against
the Kennedy machine, consequences be damned.</p>
<p>"What did I do to
deserve this punishment?" Josh asked indignantly. "I don't want you to be my tutor. What do you think of that?"</p>
<p>"Fine with me. I'll
just go tell Krupps that you refused my help and I'll have my lunch periods to
myself again," Sam called his bluff, knowing that participating in the tutoring
program had become a condition of his remaining on the team. It was either shape up academically, or be
benched for the rest of the season.
Wooden chair legs scraped discordantly against linoleum as Sam got up to
leave the library.</p>
<p>"Wait," Josh muttered, fuming at her. Coach had him by the short and curlies; there
was no doubt about it. He had to do
this. "This sucks, you know." At least he had gotten his feeble objections
on the record.</p>
<p>"I know," Sam agreed solemnly, sitting back down, "but
there's nothing either one of us can do about it so we might as well get
started."</p>
<p>"Whatever," Josh grumbled.</p>
<p>"And although reading about the latest antics of the ex-Federline
family might be a helluva lot more interesting, it's not doing much to improve
your grades," Sam gently pried the tabloid magazine from Josh's grasp and got
down to business. "What do you have for
English homework?"</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"So now I have to spend every lunch period in the library
with Josh until the end of the term," Sam complained to her mother that evening
as she sliced tomatoes for a salad.</p>
<p>Jane turned away from the stove to face her daughter. "You're not getting any sympathy from
me. It's the least you can do after
publishing that article."</p>
<p>"Mom! Whose side are
you on?" Sam looked up from her task and accidentally dropped her knife on the
cutting board with a clatter.</p>
<p>"There are no sides that I can see, Sam," Jane responded
reasonably. "But you did cross a line
when you printed the GPAs of the football team and the cheerleading squad. That was a blatant invasion of privacy and
nobody's business."</p>
<p>"You don't think the student body deserves to know that
people who participate in the school's most popular activities aren't held to
any kind of academic standard?" Sam challenged.</p>
<p>"Come on now," Jane chided.
"Do you honestly think that public embarrassment was the way to get your
message across? You could have written
the story ten different ways and never used that information. It was malicious. Admit it."</p>
<p>"It was not malicious," Sam denied, "it's the truth!" Sam picked up the knife and stabbed the air
with it, emphasizing her point.</p>
<p>Wearily wondering where her daughter's stubbornness came
from, Jane dropped the subject. Endless
discussion of last week's Zapruder article had changed nothing, and she was
tired of the way Sam's actions were dividing her nascent family. The girls had just begun to get along when
Sam had embarked on a crusade kick a few months ago, finding new ways to
agitate Brooke and keeping the discord between them continual and fresh, like a
bruise that stayed mottled and purple by repeated punching. Jane had kept a progressively closer eye on
her daughter, concerned by the restless frustration that seemed to result in
Sam lashing out with these upsetting projects that made everyone connected with
them miserable. That the incidents were
just short of doing real harm didn't make Jane feel any better.</p>
<p>Two brunette heads turned at the sound of the kitchen door opening,
and Sam bent to her tomatoes as Jane welcomed Brooke home.</p>
<p>"Hi, Brooke, honey, how was your day?" Jane smiled at her
stepdaughter, turning her cheek as Brooke gave her an affectionate peck.</p>
<p>"Exhausting. I'm
going to get out of these clothes and take a shower." Brooke gestured to her
limp glamazon workout gear, ignoring the other occupant of the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Dinner is almost ready; can you be done by then?" Jane
asked.</p>
<p>"That depends," Brooke said, her tone becoming chilly. "Will she be there?"</p>
<p>Jane sighed, but Sam answered for her.</p>
<p>"Of course I will, Brooke, just like I am every night."</p>
<p>"Then no, I'll just grab something from the fridge later,"
Brooke directed her reply to Jane.
Mother and daughter watched as she bounded up the stairs without another
word.</p>
<p>"This has to stop, Sam."</p>
<p>"I didn't do anything," Sam protested.</p>
<p>"Yes, you did. And
I've had enough. I want both of your
faces, preferably smiling, sitting at the table for dinner when Mike gets
home." Jane looked at her watch. "You've got about ten minutes, Sam. Make this right."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>As Sam was about to knock on Brooke's door, it opened. Brooke stood there in her robe, obviously on
her way to the bathroom for her shower.</p>
<p>"Get out of the way," Brooke barked.</p>
<p>Sam didn't move and said nothing, at a sudden loss for
words. This was the first sentence
Brooke had spoken to her since the article was published.</p>
<p>Brooke shifted her weight and stuck out her chin. "Do you want me to push you out of the way?"
she warned, "because I will."</p>
<p>Sam cleared her throat.
"My mother would really like it if you joined us for dinner. I would like it too."</p>
<p>"I have no problem with your mother. But the thought of sharing a table with you
turns my stomach so I'm going to decline your invitation."</p>
<p>"Brooke, why are you so pissed off? I was only telling the truth in that
article. And anyway, you have a 3.8
GPA. Why do you care if other people
know it?" Sam was feeling ashamed and defensive, which had become common to her
interactions with Brooke.</p>
<p>Brooke exploded at Sam's obtuseness. "I really don't believe you. Is it possible that you can't understand why
I'd be angry? That article was just the
latest gambit in your scorched earth campaign against me and my friends. Why do you insist on persecuting me? What did I ever do to you? First it was the walkout you staged during
the pep rally, then it was the anthrax rumor during the first night game of the
season. Don't even try to tell me that
wasn't you. The stands were empty by
halftime. And now this. Do you really think Mary Cherry wanted anyone
to know that she has a 1.3 grade point average?
And poor Josh? He's the best athlete
the school has and now people think he's an idiot." Brooke shook her head at the injustice. "I heard you're his new tutor," she added in
a tone of disbelief.</p>
<p>"That's Krupp's fault.
Don't blame me," Sam defended herself against this last accusation, not
able to deny any of the others. Hearing
all the evidence stacked against her was sobering.</p>
<p>Some of Brooke's anger dissipated when Sam's usual bitchy
retort was not forthcoming. Figuring out
what lay behind Sam's tirades against her and her friends had been
impossible. They had been making
tentative steps toward friendship when Sam's full-bore assault had brought them
right back to square one. She had even
discussed the problem with Jane in hopes of gaining some insight as to why Sam
was behaving so vengefully, but Jane hadn't a clue either. The upshot was that Brooke had learned to
keep her mouth shut around Sam, lest it result in a Zapruder cover story with
quotes from her own lips.</p>
<p>"If anything," Sam continued in the face of Brooke's
perplexed silence, "you should be Josh's tutor.
You get better grades."</p>
<p>"No thanks. The last
thing Josh and I need is to spend every lunch period together."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I guess it's only been, what, like, a month since you two broke up. Too soon, huh?" Sam felt like she should acknowledge the implication of Brooke's statement, however awkward it made her feel. Theirs was not a relationship that allowed for intimate disclosures.</p>
<p>Brooke was about to confide in Sam when she remembered she
was supposed to be angry with her, and she certainly couldn't trust her. "It's none of your business," she snapped.</p>
<p>That was more like it.
Sam nodded, back on familiar ground.
But she was too tired to get snippy.
"You're right, it's not," she agreed.</p>
<p>Brooke looked at her housemate in confusion. That was the second opportunity for a rapid
fire comeback that Sam had passed up.
This subdued girl before her now was so at odds with the strident
combatant she knew from school, she briefly wondered if Sam was suffering from
schizophrenia. It was more likely that
Sam just suffered from permanent mood swings or some undiagnosed condition. Annoying-itis, maybe. Or niceness deficit disorder. Whatever the cause of Sam's momentary
quietude, Brooke impulsively decided to take advantage of it and ask Sam a
favor. Before she could stop herself she
said, "Would you do something for me, Sam?"</p>
<p>"What?" Sam replied warily.</p>
<p>"Josh is smart; he just doesn't have faith that his brain
can do it. He needs someone who will
really get through to him, really try for him, you know? You're in a position to do him some
good. Will you promise to help him as
much as you can?"</p>
<p>Sam nearly took a step back she was so surprised at Brooke's
request. Even though they had parted,
Brooke still cared enough for Josh to worry about how he performed
academically. That was nice. Or maybe Brooke still harbored lingering
romantic feelings for her ex-boyfriend.
At any rate, the reason for Brooke's kindness toward Josh was
incidental. Although Sam was reluctant
to believe it, here was irrefutable proof that Brooke had a good heart. And if Brooke was entrusting Sam with her
request, then Sam would fulfill it as best she could. "I'll try, Brooke. I promise to try."</p>
<p>"Thanks." Brooke
smiled at Sam, and to Sam it felt like someone had just thrown open a window,
letting in a cool breeze that teased her skin, sharpened her awareness. And she was alarmed to find herself
blushing.</p>
<p>It was ridiculous.
Sam's current modus operandi of arranging the most elaborate, bombastic,
destructive, public situations in order to loom larger in Brooke's sight did
not seem to be working at all. Yet all
Brooke had to do was quietly ask a favor and Sam helplessly pledged herself to
discharge it.</p>
<p>In her own heart, Sam could admit the reason behind her
crusade against football and cheerleaders and the popular crowd was simply a
way to attract Brooke's attention, negative though it may be. Unable to deal with Brooke's indifference,
Sam devised plans to bring herself into Brooke's line of sight. Unfortunately, she wasn't clever enough to
figure out how to do this in a positive way, repeatedly hurting Brooke in the
process. The negative impact she was
having on Brooke's life was better than no impact at all. And the most confounding thing was Sam's own
inability to figure out why she needed, craved even, Brooke's notice. Her frustration cut her to the quick even now
and she felt her eyes fill with tears.</p>
<p>Brooke noticed.
"What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," Sam answered automatically, bowing her head to
hide the lachrymose evidence. After a
moment she faced Brooke again, all traces of her distress gone. "Look, come down to dinner or don't. I really don't care. As a matter of fact, I'm not that hungry so
feel free to have dinner without nausea-inducing me at the table." With that, she turned and entered her own
room, leaving Brooke in the hallway alone.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Did you read the chapter on Reconstruction yet?" Sam asked,
trying to hide her exasperation. Josh
was being especially unproductive today.</p>
<p>"No, I'm still on the Battle at Gettysburg.
There's way too much reading in this class," Josh complained.</p>
<p>"It's history. All
you have to do is read."</p>
<p>"And memorize. And
remember all those dates, and who won what battle and who was the general..."
Josh sounded completely demoralized.</p>
<p>Sam had soon realized that many factors contributed to effective
tutoring. Sometimes she had to hound
Josh as if she were his mother, sometimes coach him like, well, a coach, and
sometimes build up his confidence like his own personal pep squad. Picking up her metaphorical pom-poms, she
went to work. "Hey, remember how well
you did on the last test? It's all about
small manageable chunks. Don't get
overwhelmed by the big picture. You are
doing really well in this class. You can
do it." Go team. Rah rah rah.
Sam was glad she was in the library and she had to speak quietly. If anyone heard her stroking Josh's ego like
she often did, she didn't think she could live it down.</p>
<p>Josh continued to stare disconsolately at the brown paper
cover of his history book. This was more
than just the usual educational reluctance, which Sam had seen a hundred times
now. They wouldn't accomplish anything
today if she didn't get whatever was bugging him out in the open. Plus she had her own Calculus homework to do
and lunch was already half over. "What's
up, Josh?</p>
<p>"You wouldn't understand," he mumbled.</p>
<p>"Try me." Relations
between them had warmed considerably since the beginning of their tutoring
sessions a month earlier. Josh had
grudgingly learned to trust her, and Sam found that she felt rewarded by aiding
him in his studies. That she was
indirectly enabling him to take part in the football program, which she had
been actively trying to discredit, had stopped bothering her so much.</p>
<p>"It's Brooke," Josh admitted.</p>
<p>Sam was not expecting this.
She sat up a little straighter.
"What about her?"</p>
<p>"She's going to go on a date-"</p>
<p>"With whom?" Sam demanded, interrupting Josh. "I haven't seen her with anyone."</p>
<p>"If you'll let me finish," Josh broke back in, peeved. "What I meant to say was that I think she's
almost ready to date again. Someday
soon, she's going to date somebody, and it's not going to be me," he said
sadly.</p>
<p>Sam considered his assertion. It had now been several months
since Brooke and Josh had broken up, and after Josh and Carmen's short-lived
affair, neither of Kennedy's formerly golden couple had seen any action. But Josh said that was about to change. "Really?
Why do you think so?"</p>
<p>"I notice stuff about her," Josh said uncomfortably.</p>
<p>"Because you're still into her," Sam realized at once,
connecting the few remaining dots in the picture.</p>
<p>Josh nodded glumly.</p>
<p>"What have you noticed?" Sam was curious.</p>
<p>"It's nothing concrete.
She just seems happier, in a more positive mood. Her body language is freer, like she's more
open to things lately."</p>
<p>Sam regarded Josh with something like wonder. The boy may not be book smart, but he was
certainly perceptive, at least when it came to Brooke. She had not noticed any change in Brooke, but
that may have been because she had taken to avoiding her housemate since the
fallout from what Brooke called her scorched earth campaign. Vague feelings of guilt and discomfort came
to the fore when she was in Brooke's vicinity, and rather than figure out why
this was, Sam chose to avoid. She was
trying a new tack, hoping it would control her unreasonable urge to stir things
up. So far it was working. Turning her mind back to Josh, she tried to
help him with his problem.</p>
<p>"Why don't you try to get her back?" she naturally asked.</p>
<p>"And how do you propose I do that?" he replied, almost
bitterly. "She'll barely talk to me
anymore, not that I blame her with all the mixed signals I've sent. She seemed like she wanted to try again when
I was with Carmen, but to me it was only Brooke wanting what she suddenly
couldn't have. Then I just needed to be
by myself for awhile." Josh turned his
head and lapsed into thought, gazing at the stacks without seeing them.</p>
<p>"And now?" Sam prompted.</p>
<p>Josh faced Sam and said with conviction, "Now I know she's
the one that I want."</p>
<p>Stifling the unexpected urge to put her fist through a wall,
which was her first uncensored reaction to Josh's admission, Sam calmly said,
"You should tell her."</p>
<p>"I can't."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because Brooke is so much smarter than me, I always end up
tongue-tied around her. Whenever I have
something important to tell her, I get nervous and the words get mixed up and
come out completely wrong."</p>
<p>Sam understood that.
Speaking extemporaneously was not easy.
It was why she valued the written word so much. "Maybe you should write her a letter. That way you can figure out what you want to
say before it's actually said. There's
less pressure that way."</p>
<p>"Hey, yeah! That's a
great idea," Josh pulled out a page of loose-leaf and picked up his pencil.</p>
<p>"Wait. You're going
to do this now? What about history? The Civil War, remember?"</p>
<p>"Later." Josh was
already distracted. He got as far as
printing 'Dear Brooke' at the top of the page when he stopped, head bent in
concentration. After a moment he looked
up at Sam. "What would you-"</p>
<p>"No. No way." Sam didn't let him finish. "If you're not going to do school work then
I've got Calculus to do." She pulled her
math text from her bag.</p>
<p>"But Sam, you're the writer.
You've got to help me."</p>
<p>"Helping you write a love letter goes above and beyond the
call of your average tutor. Forget
it." Sam opened her book, propping it
between them so she couldn't see what Josh was doing.</p>
<p>A few minutes elapsed while the pair worked in silence. Sam could hear the scratching of Josh's pencil,
then she felt the table quaking while Josh erased the hell out of
something. She refused to look up from
her homework problems. When the
scratching and table trembling stopped, her curiosity got the better of her.</p>
<p>"What do you have so far?" she asked, placing her book flat
on the table.</p>
<p>Josh sheepishly passed the paper to her.</p>
<i>
<p>Dear Brooke,</p>
<p>Would you like to go out on a date with me?</p>
<p>_____ Yes</p>
<p>_____ No</p>
<p>_____ Maybe/Ask again later</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Josh</p>
</i>
<p>"This is a joke, right?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"It's worked before," Josh claimed. "One time I passed her a note like this in
Biology lab and she loved it!"</p>
<p>"It's not going to work this time," Sam said flatly. "You're trying to jumpstart your
relationship, not put it up on concrete blocks.
You want to revive something that may already be dead in her eyes. Tell her all the reasons why you don't
deserve her, then convince her to give you a chance. Appeal to her sense of passion. Girls like to be swept off their feet."</p>
<p>"Okay. That's
good." Josh readied himself to write
again, then glanced up from the page, at a loss. "How do I do that?"</p>
<p>"You have to draw a line between everything that went before
and what you want to happen in the future.
There has to be a clear demarcation."</p>
<p>Josh wrote feverishly, trying to get it all down.</p>
<p>"Start with an apology.
She's blameless, everything is your fault." Sam continued, a thoughtful
look on her face.</p>
<p>Josh offered her the pencil.
"Please, Sam, just give me a few ideas."</p>
<p>Entire paragraphs were forming in her mind. After a moment's hesitation, Sam took the
pencil and turned the paper to its blank side.
She started to write.</p>
<p>When the bell rang twenty minutes later, she handed Josh the
paper, now covered with her words. "Type
it or copy it over in your handwriting," Sam instructed. "She never finds out about this."</p>
<p>"No, never," Josh began to read what she had written. "This is perfect, Sam! Thank you!"
He put the letter between the pages of his history book and shoved it
into his backpack before racing to his next class.</p>
<p>"Don't forget to do your homework!" Sam called after him,
earning a frown of disapproval from the librarian. In no rush to move, she sat there staring
into space until the second bell sounded.
Shakily running a hand through her hair, she tried to get a hold of
herself. Of all the thoughts now racing
through her brain, there was one that was making itself heard with a desperate
repetitive urgency: I am in big trouble.</p>
