<chapter title="Part 1">
<p>Two girls prepared their breakfasts in silence. The kitchen was almost too small to hold them
both. In an intricate ballet of
avoidance they orbited the toaster; one waiting impatiently, frozen waffle in
hand, while the other's bagel slowly cooked between orange coils of heat. An inadvertent glance might slide past a red
cotton sleeve, an earlobe, the weathered rivet on a denim-clad hip - but it
never met the wary features on the face of the other occupant. Like magnets aligned at their poles, the two
girls repelled each other. The opposing forces
they unwittingly exerted insured the distance that kept them at odds. This is how it had always been, ever since
the girls had been forced into each other's field. And as they were also aligned in their mutual aversion,
they exited the kitchen without a word passing between them.</p>
<p>But soon something would happen to cause a pole reversal in one
of the girls, not unlike a magnet when it is flipped to its opposite side. She will be unable to maintain the field
between them, powerless to resist the magnetic pull. What follows is a simple demonstration of scientific
principle: repulsion will turn into attraction.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sam McPherson entered the school library and searched the
faces of her schoolmates until she found the particular face she was looking
for. Never one to back away from a
difficult situation (especially one of her own making), she purposefully
crossed the room and sat down at a library table across from Kennedy High's
slightly tarnished football hero. "I'm
your tutor," she said sullenly to Josh Ford.</p>
<p>Looking up from the current issue of People magazine into
the eyes of the one who had done the tarnishing, Josh recoiled in disgust. "You?"</p>
<p>"Yes, me. Principal
Krupps forced me to 'volunteer' after the whole GPA expos&amp;#233; thing. He thought it a karmic-ly apt
punishment." Crossed arms and a wry
delivery did little to disguise Sam's discomfort. She had known that her latest article in the
Zapruder had been ethically borderline, but had done it anyway. Just one more instance of her raging against
the Kennedy machine, consequences be damned.</p>
<p>"What did I do to
deserve this punishment?" Josh asked indignantly. "I don't want you to be my tutor. What do you think of that?"</p>
<p>"Fine with me. I'll
just go tell Krupps that you refused my help and I'll have my lunch periods to
myself again," Sam called his bluff, knowing that participating in the tutoring
program had become a condition of his remaining on the team. It was either shape up academically, or be
benched for the rest of the season.
Wooden chair legs scraped discordantly against linoleum as Sam got up to
leave the library.</p>
<p>"Wait," Josh muttered, fuming at her. Coach had him by the short and curlies; there
was no doubt about it. He had to do
this. "This sucks, you know." At least he had gotten his feeble objections
on the record.</p>
<p>"I know," Sam agreed solemnly, sitting back down, "but
there's nothing either one of us can do about it so we might as well get
started."</p>
<p>"Whatever," Josh grumbled.</p>
<p>"And although reading about the latest antics of the ex-Federline
family might be a helluva lot more interesting, it's not doing much to improve
your grades," Sam gently pried the tabloid magazine from Josh's grasp and got
down to business. "What do you have for
English homework?"</p>
<hr/>
<p>"So now I have to spend every lunch period in the library
with Josh until the end of the term," Sam complained to her mother that evening
as she sliced tomatoes for a salad.</p>
<p>Jane turned away from the stove to face her daughter. "You're not getting any sympathy from
me. It's the least you can do after
publishing that article."</p>
<p>"Mom! Whose side are
you on?" Sam looked up from her task and accidentally dropped her knife on the
cutting board with a clatter.</p>
<p>"There are no sides that I can see, Sam," Jane responded
reasonably. "But you did cross a line
when you printed the GPAs of the football team and the cheerleading squad. That was a blatant invasion of privacy and
nobody's business."</p>
<p>"You don't think the student body deserves to know that
people who participate in the school's most popular activities aren't held to
any kind of academic standard?" Sam challenged.</p>
<p>"Come on now," Jane chided.
"Do you honestly think that public embarrassment was the way to get your
message across? You could have written
the story ten different ways and never used that information. It was malicious. Admit it."</p>
<p>"It was not malicious," Sam denied, "it's the truth!" Sam picked up the knife and stabbed the air
with it, emphasizing her point.</p>
<p>Wearily wondering where her daughter's stubbornness came
from, Jane dropped the subject. Endless
discussion of last week's Zapruder article had changed nothing, and she was
tired of the way Sam's actions were dividing her nascent family. The girls had just begun to get along when
Sam had embarked on a crusade kick a few months ago, finding new ways to
agitate Brooke and keeping the discord between them continual and fresh, like a
bruise that stayed mottled and purple by repeated punching. Jane had kept a progressively closer eye on
her daughter, concerned by the restless frustration that seemed to result in
Sam lashing out with these upsetting projects that made everyone connected with
them miserable. That the incidents were
just short of doing real harm didn't make Jane feel any better.</p>
<p>Two brunette heads turned at the sound of the kitchen door opening,
and Sam bent to her tomatoes as Jane welcomed Brooke home.</p>
<p>"Hi, Brooke, honey, how was your day?" Jane smiled at her
stepdaughter, turning her cheek as Brooke gave her an affectionate peck.</p>
<p>"Exhausting. I'm
going to get out of these clothes and take a shower." Brooke gestured to her
limp glamazon workout gear, ignoring the other occupant of the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Dinner is almost ready; can you be done by then?" Jane
asked.</p>
<p>"That depends," Brooke said, her tone becoming chilly. "Will she be there?"</p>
<p>Jane sighed, but Sam answered for her.</p>
<p>"Of course I will, Brooke, just like I am every night."</p>
<p>"Then no, I'll just grab something from the fridge later,"
Brooke directed her reply to Jane.
Mother and daughter watched as she bounded up the stairs without another
word.</p>
<p>"This has to stop, Sam."</p>
<p>"I didn't do anything," Sam protested.</p>
<p>"Yes, you did. And
I've had enough. I want both of your
faces, preferably smiling, sitting at the table for dinner when Mike gets
home." Jane looked at her watch. "You've got about ten minutes, Sam. Make this right."</p>
<hr/>
<p>As Sam was about to knock on Brooke's door, it opened. Brooke stood there in her robe, obviously on
her way to the bathroom for her shower.</p>
<p>"Get out of the way," Brooke barked.</p>
<p>Sam didn't move and said nothing, at a sudden loss for
words. This was the first sentence
Brooke had spoken to her since the article was published.</p>
<p>Brooke shifted her weight and stuck out her chin. "Do you want me to push you out of the way?"
she warned, "because I will."</p>
<p>Sam cleared her throat.
"My mother would really like it if you joined us for dinner. I would like it too."</p>
<p>"I have no problem with your mother. But the thought of sharing a table with you
turns my stomach so I'm going to decline your invitation."</p>
<p>"Brooke, why are you so pissed off? I was only telling the truth in that
article. And anyway, you have a 3.8
GPA. Why do you care if other people
know it?" Sam was feeling ashamed and defensive, which had become common to her
interactions with Brooke.</p>
<p>Brooke exploded at Sam's obtuseness. "I really don't believe you. Is it possible that you can't understand why
I'd be angry? That article was just the
latest gambit in your scorched earth campaign against me and my friends. Why do you insist on persecuting me? What did I ever do to you? First it was the walkout you staged during
the pep rally, then it was the anthrax rumor during the first night game of the
season. Don't even try to tell me that
wasn't you. The stands were empty by
halftime. And now this. Do you really think Mary Cherry wanted anyone
to know that she has a 1.3 grade point average?
And poor Josh? He's the best athlete
the school has and now people think he's an idiot." Brooke shook her head at the injustice. "I heard you're his new tutor," she added in
a tone of disbelief.</p>
<p>"That's Krupp's fault.
Don't blame me," Sam defended herself against this last accusation, not
able to deny any of the others. Hearing
all the evidence stacked against her was sobering.</p>
<p>Some of Brooke's anger dissipated when Sam's usual bitchy
retort was not forthcoming. Figuring out
what lay behind Sam's tirades against her and her friends had been
impossible. They had been making
tentative steps toward friendship when Sam's full-bore assault had brought them
right back to square one. She had even
discussed the problem with Jane in hopes of gaining some insight as to why Sam
was behaving so vengefully, but Jane hadn't a clue either. The upshot was that Brooke had learned to
keep her mouth shut around Sam, lest it result in a Zapruder cover story with
quotes from her own lips.</p>
<p>"If anything," Sam continued in the face of Brooke's
perplexed silence, "you should be Josh's tutor.
You get better grades."</p>
<p>"No thanks. The last
thing Josh and I need is to spend every lunch period together."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I guess it's only been, what, like, a month since you two broke up. Too soon, huh?" Sam felt like she should acknowledge the implication of Brooke's statement, however awkward it made her feel. Theirs was not a relationship that allowed for intimate disclosures.</p>
<p>Brooke was about to confide in Sam when she remembered she
was supposed to be angry with her, and she certainly couldn't trust her. "It's none of your business," she snapped.</p>
<p>That was more like it.
Sam nodded, back on familiar ground.
But she was too tired to get snippy.
"You're right, it's not," she agreed.</p>
<p>Brooke looked at her housemate in confusion. That was the second opportunity for a rapid
fire comeback that Sam had passed up.
This subdued girl before her now was so at odds with the strident
combatant she knew from school, she briefly wondered if Sam was suffering from
schizophrenia. It was more likely that
Sam just suffered from permanent mood swings or some undiagnosed condition. Annoying-itis, maybe. Or niceness deficit disorder. Whatever the cause of Sam's momentary
quietude, Brooke impulsively decided to take advantage of it and ask Sam a
favor. Before she could stop herself she
said, "Would you do something for me, Sam?"</p>
<p>"What?" Sam replied warily.</p>
<p>"Josh is smart; he just doesn't have faith that his brain
can do it. He needs someone who will
really get through to him, really try for him, you know? You're in a position to do him some
good. Will you promise to help him as
much as you can?"</p>
<p>Sam nearly took a step back she was so surprised at Brooke's
request. Even though they had parted,
Brooke still cared enough for Josh to worry about how he performed
academically. That was nice. Or maybe Brooke still harbored lingering
romantic feelings for her ex-boyfriend.
At any rate, the reason for Brooke's kindness toward Josh was
incidental. Although Sam was reluctant
to believe it, here was irrefutable proof that Brooke had a good heart. And if Brooke was entrusting Sam with her
request, then Sam would fulfill it as best she could. "I'll try, Brooke. I promise to try."</p>
<p>"Thanks." Brooke
smiled at Sam, and to Sam it felt like someone had just thrown open a window,
letting in a cool breeze that teased her skin, sharpened her awareness. And she was alarmed to find herself
blushing.</p>
<p>It was ridiculous.
Sam's current modus operandi of arranging the most elaborate, bombastic,
destructive, public situations in order to loom larger in Brooke's sight did
not seem to be working at all. Yet all
Brooke had to do was quietly ask a favor and Sam helplessly pledged herself to
discharge it.</p>
<p>In her own heart, Sam could admit the reason behind her
crusade against football and cheerleaders and the popular crowd was simply a
way to attract Brooke's attention, negative though it may be. Unable to deal with Brooke's indifference,
Sam devised plans to bring herself into Brooke's line of sight. Unfortunately, she wasn't clever enough to
figure out how to do this in a positive way, repeatedly hurting Brooke in the
process. The negative impact she was
having on Brooke's life was better than no impact at all. And the most confounding thing was Sam's own
inability to figure out why she needed, craved even, Brooke's notice. Her frustration cut her to the quick even now
and she felt her eyes fill with tears.</p>
<p>Brooke noticed.
"What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," Sam answered automatically, bowing her head to
hide the lachrymose evidence. After a
moment she faced Brooke again, all traces of her distress gone. "Look, come down to dinner or don't. I really don't care. As a matter of fact, I'm not that hungry so
feel free to have dinner without nausea-inducing me at the table." With that, she turned and entered her own
room, leaving Brooke in the hallway alone.</p>
<hr/>
<p>"Did you read the chapter on Reconstruction yet?" Sam asked,
trying to hide her exasperation. Josh
was being especially unproductive today.</p>
<p>"No, I'm still on the Battle at Gettysburg.
There's way too much reading in this class," Josh complained.</p>
<p>"It's history. All
you have to do is read."</p>
<p>"And memorize. And
remember all those dates, and who won what battle and who was the general..."
Josh sounded completely demoralized.</p>
<p>Sam had soon realized that many factors contributed to effective
tutoring. Sometimes she had to hound
Josh as if she were his mother, sometimes coach him like, well, a coach, and
sometimes build up his confidence like his own personal pep squad. Picking up her metaphorical pom-poms, she
went to work. "Hey, remember how well
you did on the last test? It's all about
small manageable chunks. Don't get
overwhelmed by the big picture. You are
doing really well in this class. You can
do it." Go team. Rah rah rah.
Sam was glad she was in the library and she had to speak quietly. If anyone heard her stroking Josh's ego like
she often did, she didn't think she could live it down.</p>
<p>Josh continued to stare disconsolately at the brown paper
cover of his history book. This was more
than just the usual educational reluctance, which Sam had seen a hundred times
now. They wouldn't accomplish anything
today if she didn't get whatever was bugging him out in the open. Plus she had her own Calculus homework to do
and lunch was already half over. "What's
up, Josh?</p>
<p>"You wouldn't understand," he mumbled.</p>
<p>"Try me." Relations
between them had warmed considerably since the beginning of their tutoring
sessions a month earlier. Josh had
grudgingly learned to trust her, and Sam found that she felt rewarded by aiding
him in his studies. That she was
indirectly enabling him to take part in the football program, which she had
been actively trying to discredit, had stopped bothering her so much.</p>
<p>"It's Brooke," Josh admitted.</p>
<p>Sam was not expecting this.
She sat up a little straighter.
"What about her?"</p>
<p>"She's going to go on a date-"</p>
<p>"With whom?" Sam demanded, interrupting Josh. "I haven't seen her with anyone."</p>
<p>"If you'll let me finish," Josh broke back in, peeved. "What I meant to say was that I think she's
almost ready to date again. Someday
soon, she's going to date somebody, and it's not going to be me," he said
sadly.</p>
<p>Sam considered his assertion. It had now been several months
since Brooke and Josh had broken up, and after Josh and Carmen's short-lived
affair, neither of Kennedy's formerly golden couple had seen any action. But Josh said that was about to change. "Really?
Why do you think so?"</p>
<p>"I notice stuff about her," Josh said uncomfortably.</p>
<p>"Because you're still into her," Sam realized at once,
connecting the few remaining dots in the picture.</p>
<p>Josh nodded glumly.</p>
<p>"What have you noticed?" Sam was curious.</p>
<p>"It's nothing concrete.
She just seems happier, in a more positive mood. Her body language is freer, like she's more
open to things lately."</p>
<p>Sam regarded Josh with something like wonder. The boy may not be book smart, but he was
certainly perceptive, at least when it came to Brooke. She had not noticed any change in Brooke, but
that may have been because she had taken to avoiding her housemate since the
fallout from what Brooke called her scorched earth campaign. Vague feelings of guilt and discomfort came
to the fore when she was in Brooke's vicinity, and rather than figure out why
this was, Sam chose to avoid. She was
trying a new tack, hoping it would control her unreasonable urge to stir things
up. So far it was working. Turning her mind back to Josh, she tried to
help him with his problem.</p>
<p>"Why don't you try to get her back?" she naturally asked.</p>
<p>"And how do you propose I do that?" he replied, almost
bitterly. "She'll barely talk to me
anymore, not that I blame her with all the mixed signals I've sent. She seemed like she wanted to try again when
I was with Carmen, but to me it was only Brooke wanting what she suddenly
couldn't have. Then I just needed to be
by myself for awhile." Josh turned his
head and lapsed into thought, gazing at the stacks without seeing them.</p>
<p>"And now?" Sam prompted.</p>
<p>Josh faced Sam and said with conviction, "Now I know she's
the one that I want."</p>
<p>Stifling the unexpected urge to put her fist through a wall,
which was her first uncensored reaction to Josh's admission, Sam calmly said,
"You should tell her."</p>
<p>"I can't."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because Brooke is so much smarter than me, I always end up
tongue-tied around her. Whenever I have
something important to tell her, I get nervous and the words get mixed up and
come out completely wrong."</p>
<p>Sam understood that.
Speaking extemporaneously was not easy.
It was why she valued the written word so much. "Maybe you should write her a letter. That way you can figure out what you want to
say before it's actually said. There's
less pressure that way."</p>
<p>"Hey, yeah! That's a
great idea," Josh pulled out a page of loose-leaf and picked up his pencil.</p>
<p>"Wait. You're going
to do this now? What about history? The Civil War, remember?"</p>
<p>"Later." Josh was
already distracted. He got as far as
printing 'Dear Brooke' at the top of the page when he stopped, head bent in
concentration. After a moment he looked
up at Sam. "What would you-"</p>
<p>"No. No way." Sam didn't let him finish. "If you're not going to do school work then
I've got Calculus to do." She pulled her
math text from her bag.</p>
<p>"But Sam, you're the writer.
You've got to help me."</p>
<p>"Helping you write a love letter goes above and beyond the
call of your average tutor. Forget
it." Sam opened her book, propping it
between them so she couldn't see what Josh was doing.</p>
<p>A few minutes elapsed while the pair worked in silence. Sam could hear the scratching of Josh's pencil,
then she felt the table quaking while Josh erased the hell out of
something. She refused to look up from
her homework problems. When the
scratching and table trembling stopped, her curiosity got the better of her.</p>
<p>"What do you have so far?" she asked, placing her book flat
on the table.</p>
<p>Josh sheepishly passed the paper to her.</p>
<i>
<p>Dear Brooke,</p>
<p>Would you like to go out on a date with me?</p>
<p>_____ Yes</p>
<p>_____ No</p>
<p>_____ Maybe/Ask again later</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Josh</p>
</i>
<p>"This is a joke, right?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"It's worked before," Josh claimed. "One time I passed her a note like this in
Biology lab and she loved it!"</p>
<p>"It's not going to work this time," Sam said flatly. "You're trying to jumpstart your
relationship, not put it up on concrete blocks.
You want to revive something that may already be dead in her eyes. Tell her all the reasons why you don't
deserve her, then convince her to give you a chance. Appeal to her sense of passion. Girls like to be swept off their feet."</p>
<p>"Okay. That's
good." Josh readied himself to write
again, then glanced up from the page, at a loss. "How do I do that?"</p>
<p>"You have to draw a line between everything that went before
and what you want to happen in the future.
There has to be a clear demarcation."</p>
<p>Josh wrote feverishly, trying to get it all down.</p>
<p>"Start with an apology.
She's blameless, everything is your fault." Sam continued, a thoughtful
look on her face.</p>
<p>Josh offered her the pencil.
"Please, Sam, just give me a few ideas."</p>
<p>Entire paragraphs were forming in her mind. After a moment's hesitation, Sam took the
pencil and turned the paper to its blank side.
She started to write.</p>
<p>When the bell rang twenty minutes later, she handed Josh the
paper, now covered with her words. "Type
it or copy it over in your handwriting," Sam instructed. "She never finds out about this."</p>
<p>"No, never," Josh began to read what she had written. "This is perfect, Sam! Thank you!"
He put the letter between the pages of his history book and shoved it
into his backpack before racing to his next class.</p>
<p>"Don't forget to do your homework!" Sam called after him,
earning a frown of disapproval from the librarian. In no rush to move, she sat there staring
into space until the second bell sounded.
Shakily running a hand through her hair, she tried to get a hold of
herself. Of all the thoughts now racing
through her brain, there was one that was making itself heard with a desperate
repetitive urgency: I am in big trouble.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Part 2">
<p>Brooke was mentally running through her homework assignments when she
opened her locker at the end of the day. She almost didn't notice the
page of loose-leaf, folded twice, that fluttered to the floor.
Picking it up and glancing at it, she immediately saw that it was in
Josh's handwriting. She leaned against the locker next to her own
and began to read. After one paragraph, she could hear her heart
beating loudly in her veins. After the second, she lifted her eyes
from the page and surveyed her surroundings, holding the letter close
to her chest.</p>
<p>There was nothing out of the ordinary in the hallway; it was filled
with the usual throng of students preparing to go home or sauntering
off to their extracurricular activities. Josh was nowhere in sight.
When Brooke saw Sam negligently slouched against a wall next to Lily's
locker, she could've sworn that the girl had been watching her. But a
moment later Sam pushed away from the wall and walked with Lily past
Brooke without meeting her eyes.</p>
<p>This was no place for something so personal, in front of prying eyes,
but Brooke could not help herself. She turned to face the inside of
her locker and started reading from the beginning again.</p>
<i>
<p>Dear Brooke,</p>
<p>I have made an unforgivable mistake. It is a mistake of my own
making, and I am the one who continues to pay for it. I have let you
slip from my fingers. Everyday I see you, your beauty etched in sharp
relief among a sea of amorphous faces, and I am reminded of what I
had, and what I've lost. I imagine us, somewhere in our past or
future, when the sun rises and sets on our happiness.</p>
<p>After so much time, I am making an overture now. It has taken a while
to gather the courage to do this. You are the standard to which I
set all others, and I feel I should try one more time before I am
resigned to a lifetime of second best. I have to know if there is
any part of your heart that is still warm for me, like a rock that
holds the heat of the day long after it has ended.</p>
<p>I wish you could see me. Really see me. The person you look upon is
so different than the person I am. If I could find a way to strip
away all the assumptions, the preconceptions, the expectations in
which we have bundled ourselves, our emotional Gore-Tex, maybe we
could see each other as we really are. I'm willing to leave myself
open to the elements if it will allow you a glimpse of the truth. Can
you see me with new eyes?</p>
<p>This letter is wholly inadequate for its purpose. I can hardly expect
a slim piece of paper to move mountains. But the words on this page
are just a few of the many I have to say, and it's not a mountain I
have to move. So I will continue to use words, hoping to find the
ones that will shift your wise, skeptical heart just enough for you to
see me. I will be here. Until that day I remain</p>
<p>Yours,
Josh</p>
</i>
<p>"Brooke, why are you wedged halfway into your locker?" Nicole Julian
sounded affronted by the image of Brooke looking less than dignified.</p>
<p>"I thought I smelled something weird," Brooke explained, stepping away
from her locker, "can you smell it?" She pushed her friend's head into
the small metal space while she swiftly slid the letter into her
handbag. It was private, not for Nic's eyes. Well, not yet, anyway.</p>
<p>"Ew! That is so foul," Nicole retreated with her hand over her nose,
then looked at Brooke with suspicion. "Wait. I didn't smell anything."</p>
<p>"Neither did I," Brooke grinned. "False alarm." She gathered her
glamazon gear and headed down the hallway. "Are you coming to practice?"</p>
<p>On their way outside, Brooke hastily revised the agenda for today's
practice, substituting a nice long distance run for the team drills
she had planned. The squad grumbled as they hit the track, but Brooke
already had her ear buds in place and didn't hear.</p>
<p>The pounding of snare and bass along with a spare, tight guitar riff
flooded her bones as she fingered the volume control to the maximum.
Lately this song got her so pumped when she was working out; she
didn't think she'd ever get tired of it. Somewhere in her brain the
lyrics registered: 'Oh, tryin' to let it go, tryin' to keep my eyes
closed...' Brooke stood up after an abbreviated stretching routine and
took off at a blistering speed, pushing herself for several laps until
she eased into a pace she could maintain for the duration of her run.
Sneakers striking the asphalt in time to the drums, pulse hammering
at her wrists, chest heaving, she finally reached the place where her
mind was detached enough to think about Josh's letter.</p>
<p>The poetic heartfelt language - he certainly had her attention. Josh
had never been one to write real love letters, but she still had a few
of the notes he had passed her in class from the early, innocent days
of their courtship locked away in her keepsake box. It seemed so long
ago now, and only served to highlight the difference between those
childish notes and the mature, poignant missive she had found in her
locker today.</p>
<p>She had no idea Josh had it in him to write something so moving, all
his hard work this semester was paying off. Although something about
the letter bothered her. It was lacking one of Josh's best qualities,
his sweetness, and the intensity in tone was antithetical to his
easy-going nature. Had Josh really changed that much? And did she
have anything to do with the changes in him? It had only been a few
months since their breakup, but the yearning that poured from every
sentence seemed to indicate he had taken it harder than she had ever
imagined.</p>
<p>And why now? Brooke had taken the time since they had split to
process her relationship with Josh and decide what she really needed
and wanted in a boyfriend. Only recently had she felt emotionally
healthy enough to contemplate jumping back into the dating pool, and
had been secretly evaluating candidates who might have partner
potential. Brooke thought she had been ready to move on, to
experience the fun of casual dating. Was another go-round with Josh,
with its built-in weightiness, something to realistically consider, or
should one of them have the guts to pull this thing out by the roots.</p>
<p>But Brooke was unable to deny the visceral effect the letter had on
her. Physiological signals like an elevated heart rate and sweaty
palms as she read it told her that she was not immune to the passion
Josh claimed to have for her. She owed it to herself to see where it
would go, didn't she? Brooke didn't know. Ambivalence made her wary.
Adopting a wait and see approach seemed the best course.</p>
<p>Her playlist, she noticed, had ended. She was the only one still
circling the track. Cheerleaders dotted the infield in small groups,
sitting on green grass waiting for their captain to release them for
the day. Slowing to a leisurely jog, she waved Nic over and told her
to dismiss the troops. They had the California State Competition
coming up next month, it began the day after Thanksgiving, and for
which they were nowhere near ready. Brooke knew she should be pushing
them harder. But not today, there was always tomorrow.</p>
<hr/>
<p>At dinner, Sam paid particular attention to Brooke, but tried to make
it appear that she wasn't. Her housemate did seem more quiet and
preoccupied, but Sam couldn't tell if it was due to the letter she had
written for Josh or if it was just Brooke's usual policy of barely
acknowledging her existence. Since it was Sam's turn to do the
dishes, Brooke had made her escape up to her room before Sam had the
chance to casually interrogate her.</p>
<p>Sam was burning to know what Brooke had thought of the letter and she
was not above inventing interactions to find out. Water running in
the bathroom told her that Brooke was most likely washing her face
before bed, a process that, for Brooke, was as lengthy as it was
complicated. Who knew so many products could be employed just to keep
one face clean? Sam knocked on the door.</p>
<p>"I'll be out in a minute," was the muffled reply.</p>
<p>"Can I come in and get my floss? It'll just take a second." An
emergency it wasn't, but Sam wasn't about to do something as drastic
as use the toilet in front of Brooke. There were some lines she
wouldn't cross.</p>
<p>Just because Sam couldn't hear Brooke's sigh of exasperation didn't
mean it didn't happen. A moment later she was admitted entry, and she
surreptitiously glanced over at Brooke while she claimed the dental
floss. Brooke was deeply involved in applying some kind of foaming
cleanser to her skin, but Sam thought her housemate could handle the
break in concentration that a conversation would cause.</p>
<p>"Do you mind if I brush my teeth while I'm in here? I think I've got
a popcorn kernel stuck between my molars." Sam pinked slightly, it
was a fine balance between making your story seem real and too much
information, and she thought she had just dipped perilously into TMI
territory.</p>
<p>"Whatever," Brooke muttered.</p>
<p>As Sam took hold of toothpaste and brush, she frowned. How would she
be able to talk if she was foaming at the mouth? Then she got annoyed
with herself, that a simple conversation with Brooke involved so much
forethought and subterfuge. It would have been much easier to write
an inflammatory editorial in the Zapruder and then have a fight about it.</p>
<p>Applying toothpaste to her toothbrush as slowly as humanly possible,
Sam casually asked, "How was your day?"</p>
<p>Shooting Sam a look of bafflement, Brooke replied, "Um, fine."</p>
<p>"Anything interesting happen today?" Sam pressed.</p>
<p>Brooke immediately went on the defensive, suspicion raising her
hackles. "What are you fishing for, Sam? What's your angle?"</p>
<p>"There is no angle," Sam claimed innocently. "We just haven't talked
much lately."</p>
<p>Brooke was getting angry. "Just like we haven't screamed at each
other much lately? Or like we haven't come to blows much lately?
Whatever story you're working on, I'm not going to help you write it!"</p>
<p>"There is no story. I'm trying to get along with you. I just thought
that we could have a normal conversation like two people who live in
the same house may be inclined to do once in a while!"</p>
<p>"You'll have to excuse me if I look on your suggestion with a hint of
incredulity, Sam. You have a pretty lousy track record when it comes
to getting along," Brooke had abandoned her skin care regime to stare
balefully at Sam's reflection in the mirror.</p>
<p>"Forget it!" Sam threw down her toothbrush and made for the door.
"I'm sorry I even tried."</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sam was up before the sun; after a restless night tossing and turning
it was useless to remain in bed. Nodding to a lone janitor as he sat
outside enjoying a peaceful, pre-bedlam cigarette, she entered the
empty halls of Kennedy High. Her footsteps echoed loudly as she
walked to the newspaper office and let herself in with the key Mr.
Grant had neglected to retrieve from her before he quit.</p>
<p>Writing something, actually putting words on paper, was the only way
she could think of to get this demon out. In her sleepless state the
previous night she had come up with a plan that would exorcise all the
insane notions that had taken root in her cerebellum, and she would
have to bring all her literary talents to bear on the result. It
would be totally worth abandoning her journalistic integrity if she
was able to pull this off.</p>
<p>For the first time in her life, Sam was going to invent a story. It
would be a tale of such hellacious, rapacious, sordid, wrathful
scandal it would make Lewinsky-gate look like Romper Room. And Brooke
was going down. Sam was going to bury her. Once and for all, she was
going to pull Brooke from her golden popular pedestal and force her to
live in ostracized obscurity with the rest of the common people.</p>
<p>She didn't have the goods on Brooke so she was going to manufacture
them, which wasn't going to be easy. She had no experience with
fiction and had no notion of what kind of tale to tell. Booting up
one of the computers, she sat in front of a blank Word document and
waited for inspiration to strike. It didn't. After ten minutes of
resisting the urge to play FreeCell, Sam had an idea. She
double-clicked a folder on the desktop labeled "Ricky," which
contained all recent photos taken by the paper's photographer,
unsurprisingly named Ricky. He would often come in after a school
event and plug his digital camera into the USB port and dump his
images into the folder, returning later to view and choose the ones
that could be considered for layout. Sam remembered him coming in
Monday morning, transferring the pictures he had taken from Friday
night's football game. Knowing Ricky's so-called "artistic"
appreciation of the female form, Sam guessed the cheerleaders would be
well represented.</p>
<p>She wasn't wrong. A hair trigger finger clicked rapidly through
endless shots of uncompleted passes and T-formations until she reached
the halftime photos. There, among arty shots of the marching band's
brass section were several close-ups of the cheerleaders on the
sidelines, their backs to the gridiron as they attempted to entertain
the crowd. There had to be an image of Brooke on which Sam could
fixate, a photo that would surely remind her of how rotten and evil
and arrogant Brooke was, one that would inspire the levels of
revulsion needed to come up with a truly shocking article for the
Zapruder Reporter.</p>
<p>And there it was. Ricky had outdone himself. An image, shot from a
low angle, appeared on the screen. The open-limbed pose displayed a
body that was at rest, but either just finished or about to start
moving. It sent a message of power and strength and joy. Lean Legs,
defined by planes of muscle, were held slightly apart, ending in
firmly planted white Jack Purcells on the track surface. Slim and
strong arms were upraised, fists clenched, suggesting force and focus.
Brooke's face was caught in an expression of breathless pleasure,
open mouthed and smiling, her eyes delighted at the response of the
unseen crowd. Her cheeks were healthily flushed and her hair swished
at an angle behind her, not having caught up with her arrested motion.</p>
<p>Sam opened the picture in Photoshop and cropped it so that it became a
close-up of Brooke's head and shoulders. Saving the new image, she
moved it to the right of the desktop before resizing her Word window
so that it could sit next to the photo without obscuring it. She
leaned in close to the monitor, intently gazing at the million or so
pixels that made up Brooke's face for a moment. Then she began to type.</p>
<p>Locker doors slamming with increasing frequency and youthful voices
raised in greeting a short time later told Sam that she would not be
alone in the Zapruder office for much longer. She sat back in her
chair and quickly read what she had written. The words had been
expelled from her with a swiftness that was annoying. Precisely
pinning her thoughts was usually as difficult as collecting falling
raindrops with an eyedropper, but the page before her had flowed with
the ease of pouring water into a glass. She was glad to have it all
purged from her mind, but sooner or later she would have to deal with
the emotions that inspired her words. Sighing in resignation, Sam
pasted the text of her document into her email program, attached the
cropped image of Brooke to it, and sent it to herself. Then she typed
Josh's name at the bottom of the document and printed it before
deleting the file. If she was going to make a habit of writing love
letters to Brooke McQueen, someone should at least get the benefit of
it.</p>

<chapter title="Part 3">
<i>
<p>Dear Brooke,</p>
<p>Thinking of you used to be something I tried to avoid. If I allowed
myself thoughts of you at all, they were quickly locked away in a
small, hard place, as dense and impenetrable as an avocado stone. Now
it's as if I've suspended them in a glass and given them free reign to
develop and mature. Soft, tender shoots have broken through and grown
into tensile tendrils, finding fertile ground in which to take root.</p>
<p>Okay, that avocado metaphor may be a little overdone, but it doesn't
change the fact that my desire for you is now firmly entrenched. My
thoughts... I can't unthink them; I can't unlearn what I know about you,
so I am writing it down, getting it all out. And hopefully you won't
mind if I offer them to you in this letter.</p>
<p>I want so much to be able to touch you. To feel with my fingers the
soft skin on your arm when the little hairs there glint in the
sunlight would, I think, make me giddy. I would like to know what that
place in the middle of your upper lip feels like; I'm thinking smooth
and warm like the nap of finest velvet. I'm sure there is a name for
that place, but not knowing what it's called doesn't make me want to
cover it with my own lips any less. I want to intimately know your
entire body - from the peach fuzz curves of your ears to the
hardworking roughness of the soles of your feet.</p>
<p>If you were to think of me, let it be as one mesmerized by a very
pleasant daydream. Maybe looking out a window somewhere, hand under
my chin and supporting my head as it grows heavy over my preoccupation
with you. And if time were money, I'd consider all the hours spent
thinking of you a very wise investment.</p>
<p>Josh</p>
</i>
<p>"Whatcha got there, Brookie?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, Nic." Brooke quickly folded the letter and placed it on top
of her textbook.</p>
<p>"Doesn't look like nothing. You were reading that thing so intensely
it looked like it might be pictures of next season's Galliano
collection. What gives?" Nic sat down at their usual table and gazed
at her expectantly. It was lunchtime, although neither girl had eaten
anything yet.</p>
<p>Brooke slid her eyes over at Nic. She hadn't been able to stop
reading this second letter since she had found it poking out of her
bag after third period. Not knowing what to do and needing to talk
about it with someone, Brooke decided to open up to the girl now
checking for shine with her compact mirror. "It's a letter. From Josh."</p>
<p>"Josh?" Nic closed her compact and frowned over her ignorance to this
development.</p>
<p>"It's a love letter." Brooke handed it over.</p>
<p>Nic quickly read it, then glanced at Brooke before reading it again.
After an extended pause, she cleared her throat and said, "That's
sweet. I didn't know Josh was the hearts and flowers type." Handing
the letter back to Brooke, she added, "Congratulations, hon. I always
knew Kennedy's premier power couple would be restored to their
rightful place at the pinnacle of the social pyramid. Although I am
surprised that you didn't tell me when it happened."</p>
<p>"But we're not together again. He just started sending these letters
out of the blue."</p>
<p>"Letters?" Nic asked. "Plural?"</p>
<p>"This is the second one."</p>
<p>"So what did you say to him?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. We haven't talked about it," Brooke's face reflected her
confusion. "What should I do?"</p>
<p>"That depends. Do you want to go out with him again?"</p>
<p>"Before I got these letters, I would have said no, definitely not.
But now," Brooke looked at the page wistfully, "I don't know. I
really love what he's saying here, but how much of that will carry
over into reality? I have so many doubts. And I broke up with him.
And what about the disaster that was taking our relationship to the
next level? Just when I think it's time to move on, he writes these
amazing things that make me want to try again."</p>
<p>"Well, I think that answers the question. Doesn't it say something
that he's trying so hard to win you over?" Nic said reasonably. "It's
creative, it's thoughtful, and sort of sexy in a 'How do I love thee,
let me count the ways' kind of way."</p>
<p>"You mean, like poetry?" Brooke said dreamily, then shook herself out
of her sappy musings. It's not poetry," she clarified, "but it makes
me feel like I'm reading a poem. Like ordinary words have new
meanings. He just seems so sincere."</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, he's not Shakespeare, but it's not bad. I should have
known a guy who does musicals would have a bit of poetry in his soul."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Booke replied distractedly. She was clearly not paying attention.</p>
<p>"So what are you going to do?" Nic asked after a moment.</p>
<p>"I'm going to go talk to him." Finally reaching a decision, Brooke
got up and walked out of the cafeteria, knowing exactly where to find
Josh.</p>
<hr/>
<p>"Did you give it to her?" Sam couldn't stop herself from asking,
lunch was almost over and Josh had been studious and quiet and
distinctly unforthcoming today. She was feeling a bit unappreciated
after providing him with another letter, an unsolicited one at that.</p>
<p>"Yes. I stuck it in her bag when she was walking to third period.
She didn't even notice me," Josh replied. He was experiencing vague
feelings of guilt regarding the second letter. The first was fine, a
spur of the moment idea that hadn't paid off, as he had received no
response from Brooke. When Sam gave him a second letter this morning,
he found he was willing to try again, but was a little bewildered by
Sam's voluntary submission. It felt wrong to continue to take credit
for Sam's letters, and why was Sam writing them anyway? It was all
slightly strange.</p>
<p>"She must have read it by now," Sam muttered, almost to herself.</p>
<p>"Hey guys, mind if I sit?" Harrison dropped into a chair at their
table without waiting for a reply. I have a David Copperfield vocab
quiz period after next. Do either of you know what pecuniary means?"
he asked, pulling from his backpack a notebook and a well-thumbed copy
of the book in question.</p>
<p>"Nope," Josh returned to his history book.</p>
<p>"It means having to do with money." Sam said briefly before turning
back to Josh. "What did she say about the first one?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. We haven't talked."</p>
<p>"Who? What are you guys talking about?" Harrison asked.</p>
<p>"Nothing." Josh and Sam spoke in unison.</p>
<p>"Okaaay," Harrison backed off, this was obviously a touchy subject.</p>
<p>There was silence at the table as the three worked independently until,</p>
<p>"Josh, can I talk to you for a minute?"</p>
<p>Three heads looked up at Brooke, who had eyes only for Josh, standing
by their table.</p>
<p>"Sure, Brooke," Josh smiled and leaned toward her.</p>
<p>Brooke glanced at Sam and Harrison. "In private?"</p>
<p>Harrison watched Sam watch intently as the pair walked to the far side
of the room and disappeared into the stacks.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" Harrison asked Sam.</p>
<p>With a concentrated effort, Sam tore her gaze from the bookshelves
that now hid the couple. Her voice was hard and hollow. "Brooke and
Josh are getting back together as we speak."</p>
<hr/>
<p>"I got your letters."</p>
<p>Josh nodded and gave Brooke a tight smile. They were standing beside
a window at the end of a narrow passageway created by two
floor-to-ceiling book cases. Dust motes swirled in the shaft of
light that fell on them.</p>
<p>"They were beautiful. I loved what you said in them. I didn't know
you still felt that way, Josh."</p>
<p>"Listen, can we not talk about the letters? They don't mean anything-"</p>
<p>"Of course they do. For the first time I'm getting some insight on
how you really feel." Brooke searched Josh's down-turned features for
some kind of evidence. "Is it... how you feel?"</p>
<p>"You know it is, Brooke," Josh replied. "I told you that the day you
broke up with me."</p>
<p>His hurt tone ruffled Brooke's feathers. "But since then you've
rejected an attempt I made to get back together and you've gone out
with another girl. What am I supposed to think of that?"</p>
<p>Josh had no answer. He sat down on the window's wide wooden sill. "I
don't know. I was really hurt; I didn't know what I wanted. I guess
I just needed time to figure that out, and now I know it's you."</p>
<p>He sounded so certain, and Brooke was so far from certainty herself.
"I don't know, Josh. I just don't know if this is the right thing.
For either of us." She gazed keenly at him, trying to divine what was
really in his heart.</p>
<p>Knowing he had some heavy-duty convincing to do, Josh became desperate
and said the first thing that came to mind. "Look. I think we need
to draw a line between what happened before and what is happening now.
Make a line of marcation, or something."</p>
<p>Brooke's eyes softened. If they were going to try, this seemed very
sensible. And it told her that he was serious about this. "That's a
good idea, Josh. The past is past."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Josh sounded relieved.</p>
<p>"But if we're going to try again, I want to go slow. Baby steps. I'm
talking glacial pace, here. We rushed into some important decisions
last time and I don't want that to happen this time. We both need to
be sure every step of the way." Brooke sat down next to him on the
window sill, their hands touched.</p>
<p>Elation surged through Josh when he felt Brooke's hand cover his.
This was going to work! He put his arm around Brooke and pulled her
into his chest.</p>
<p>Brooke leaned her head against his shoulder, admitting to herself how
good the weight of Josh's strong arm felt. Suddenly she felt his lips
on her cheek, and then he took her completely by surprise, grasping
her upper arms, turning her towards him and kissing her forcefully,
his tongue pushing into her mouth.</p>
<p>Although he had never before given her reason to fear him, Brooke
panicked at Josh's effortless physical dominance. She brought her
palms up, pushing as hard as she could against his chest. "Didn't you
hear what I just said? I said SLOW!"</p>
<p>Josh stared at her, speechless.</p>
<p>Brooke gazed back, trying to get a handle on her confusion and
instinctual distrust. She tried to reconcile the earnest voice in his
letters with the actual boy in front of her - and couldn't. "This was
a mistake," she muttered, backing away from him.</p>
<p>"No, wait! Brooke, I'm sorry," Josh called after her, but she was
already gone from sight.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sam and Harrison looked up to see Brooke rushing by their table on her
way out of the library. A few seconds later, Josh emerged from the
stacks, looking grim.</p>
<p>"What happened?" Sam demanded.</p>
<p>"I kissed her."</p>
<p>"But that's good, right?" Harrison wanted to know.</p>
<p>"Then why did she just run out of here like you're Wile E. Coyote and
she's the Road Runner?" Sam didn't wait for Josh to answer Harrison.
Something was not right. She could feel it.</p>
<p>"We were talking, it was going well," Josh reported. "We decided to
try again, and she said she wanted to go really slow. I put my arm
around her. Then, I just had to kiss her; it was like this
unstoppable urge. So I did. And it was too much. Too fast. She
changed her mind. Just like that." He snapped his fingers, it
sounded like a whipcrack in the quiet library.</p>
<p>"Just because you kissed her? That makes no sense. It's not like you
haven't kissed her before, I've seen it with my own eyes." Sam said,
trace amounts of bitterness detectable in her voice.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, she wasn't ready for it. I pushed too hard," Josh spoke
savagely, looking right at Sam. "It's my fault. And why do you care
so much, anyway?"</p>
<p>"So you're just giving up?" Harrison asked, totally invested in this
soap opera now.</p>
<p>"No, he's not giving up," Sam answered for him. She turned to Josh,
"Are you?"</p>
<p>"No, but-"</p>
<p>"The bell is going to ring any second. What class does she have now?"
Sam asked Josh, in total planning mode.</p>
<p>"Drafting," Harrison replied, shrugging when Sam and Josh turned to
him in surprise.</p>
<p>"Brooke takes drafting?" Josh wondered.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it's part of that interior design kick she's been on," Sam
said, only knowing this fact because of her talent for eavesdropping
on her mother's conversations with Brooke. "Go meet her at her class
and try and talk to her. Apologize, grovel, do what it takes."</p>
<p>Just then the bell rang that signaled changing classes. None of them
made a move to leave; they were all too caught up in Josh and Brooke's
drama.</p>
<p>In the silence that followed the bell, Josh said, "She won't listen to
me, Sam; she's pissed."</p>
<p>"That's why you have to do it now, before the anger sinks in. It's
like a grass stain. If you don't shout it out now, it'll be even
harder to remove later." Sam thought for a minute, then turned to
Harrison. "They use computers in drafting, don't they?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I took it last semester. We did some stuff on AutoCAD."</p>
<p>"Josh, you could email her. Or better yet, IM her." Sam suggested.</p>
<p>"Right now? She won't have her email open, or instant messenger,"
Josh protested. "And anyway, I hardly ever use email. I don't think
I've emailed Brooke more than a few times. I always just call her."</p>
<p>"Well, she can't take your calls in class and desperate times call for
desperate measures."</p>
<p>"Wait. Emory's in that class. I'll text him to tell Brooke to open
an IM client right now." Harrison pulled out his phone and quickly
sent a text message.</p>
<p>"Do those computers even have instant messenger on them?" Josh was
still unsure.</p>
<p>Harrison smirked. "Look around. There's three class labs plus the
machines in here, and one tech for the whole school. It takes three
seconds to reinstall after he removes it. The dude really needs to
use better security." He moved to one of the library workstations and
sat down. "Josh, what's your user ID?"</p>
<p>Josh and Sam went and stood behind him. "jfordqb2000," Josh replied.</p>
<p>"Password?"</p>
<p>Josh hesitated a moment before saying, "Mickey mouse, no space."</p>
<p>After a few keystrokes Harrison said, "Look. Ready and waiting. A
little yellow smiley face next to 'blu_brookemcq.' Who do you think
that might be?" He stood up and pulled the chair back for Josh, who
then sat down.</p>
<p>"She's there?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yep. All you have to do is type," Harrison replied.</p>
<p>Sam and Harrison stood behind Josh, the thought of giving him some
privacy never entering their minds. Sam especially appeared to be a
bit on edge; her arms were crossed over her chest and she gnawed on a
thumbnail while waiting for Josh to put the keyboard to use.</p>
<p>Finally, after thirty seconds that passed in super slo-mo, he began to
peck with his two index fingers.</p>
<p>Jfordqb2000: Hi Brooke, r u there?</p>
<p>A few moments passed, then, in the IM window appeared:</p>
<p>Blu_brookemcq: Josh, I don't have time for this. I'm in class.</p>
<p>Josh stared at the screen. "See? She's mad. I don't even know what
to say to her."</p>
<p>"Tell her you're sorry," Sam urged.</p>
<p>Dutifully, Josh typed:</p>
<p>Jfordqb2000: I know, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Sam couldn't help interjecting, "No! That sounds like you're sorry
for interrupting her in class. You need to apologize for what
happened here and tell her why you're sorry."</p>
<p>Harrison and Sam watched as Josh typed with painful slowness.</p>
<p>Jfordqb2000: And I'm sorry for what happened in the library. It's
just that you're so hot and you looked so awesome and you smelled so
good. I couldn't help it.</p>
<p>Harrison rolled his eyes and Sam just barely stifled a groan.</p>
<p>Blu_brookemcq: Are you saying it's my fault?</p>
<p>All three of them could hear the iciness in Brooke's reply.</p>
<p>Josh held up his hands in a gesture of surrender. "I can't do this.
I have no idea what to say."</p>
<p>"Get up," Sam said. When Josh didn't move, she put her hand on his
shoulder and repeated, "Get up. I can fix this."</p>
<p>"Wait Sam, what are you doing?" Harrison looked at her askance.</p>
<p>Josh got up and Sam slid into his seat and quickly began to type.</p>
<p>Jfordqb2000: Is it your fault that I lose hold of my senses when I'm
in your presence? Is it your fault that I feel drawn to you with the
inevitability of a moth to a naked 100 watt bulb? That my hands
disobey my brain and reach for you when I know it could mean my
downfall? Maybe you won't like this answer, but yes, it is your fault.</p>
<p>Sam slapped the enter key and Josh clapped his hands on his head.</p>
<p>"Oh god, she'll hate me!" he exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Let's see what she makes of that," Sam said, not sounding as sure of
herself as she was ten seconds ago.</p>
<p>Harrison simply looked from Josh to Sam in silence, trying to decipher
why Sam was calling the shots and why Josh was allowing it.</p>
<p>A message at the bottom of the window told them Brooke was typing a
reply. They didn't have to wait long to see:</p>
<p>Blu_brookemcq: Go on.</p>
<p>For Sam, those two words were like the drawbridge opening up, her
permission to enter the castle. She hunched over the keyboard and
went on.</p>
<p>Jfordqb2000: What I feel for you is strong. So strong that sometimes
my actions are pure instinct. And my instincts don't always follow
the path of politeness and manners. At the basest level, my response
to you is violent, immediate, and fierce. But it is also the truest
expression of what is in my heart. My feelings towards you are not
ambivalent and I find it impossible to subjugate them - even for your
sake. Please accept my deepest apology. I can't promise it won't
happen again; you are as powerful and potent as any drug and I am a
hopeless addict. But I want nothing more than to honor your wishes
and I'll try with all my heart to be what you want me to be.</p>
<p>Sam sat back while Josh and Harrison leaned in closer, waiting for
Brooke's response.</p>
<p>Blu_brookemcq: Meet me at the water fountain by the Novak. Now.</p>
<p>Sam, unthinkingly, was halfway out of her chair when Josh shook her
shoulders in triumph, effectively pushing her back down.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Sam! That was so awesome! I totally owe you." He scampered
back to the table and collected his belongings before exiting the
library.</p>
<p>"Don't screw it up this time," Sam muttered.</p>
<p>Harrison pulled a chair over to Sam's workstation and sat down beside
his longtime friend, who now sat staring sightlessly at the computer
screen before her.</p>
<p>"Would you mind telling me what you think you're doing?" he asked.
"That's pretty mean, don't you think?"</p>
<p>"Mean?" Sam turned to look at him, bewildered.</p>
<p>"Yeah, mean. You're manipulating things between Josh and Brooke, and
the reason can't be good. Is this another stunt in your war against
the popular crowd, the results of which I can't begin to fathom?"
Harrison was Sam's staunch friend, but even he was losing patience
with her unreasonable aversion to certain members of their class.
Admittedly, she hadn't done anything lately, but that didn't mean she
wasn't taking the longer view.</p>
<p>"I'm not being mean. Josh asked me for help and I'm helping him."</p>
<p>"He asked you to help him get back together with Brooke? I find that
a little hard to believe, since you extremely hate her."</p>
<p>"I do not hate her," Sam said defensively. "So I wrote a couple of
love letters for him, what's the big deal?"</p>
<p>"You wrote love letters? For him to give to Brooke?" Josh asked
incredulously.</p>
<p>"I think she really liked them," Sam said faintly.</p>
<p>Harrison just stared. He didn't even know where to begin. Did Sam
all of a sudden have a personality transplant, or was she simply
abducted by aliens and replaced by someone who looked and talked like
Sam, but was actually a pod person from a Sci Fi channel series.
"Don't you think that's a little personal to do for someone else?"</p>
<p>Sam gazed right into Harrison's eyes, revealing something huge for the
first time. "Not if I feel the same way."</p>
<p>This cleared up nothing. Harrison was completely confused. "You mean
you were writing the letters to Josh?"</p>
<p>Now impatient for him to catch up, Sam said, "No. I was writing the
letters to Brooke. Every word is true. I was being completely honest."</p>
<p>"So you wrote love letters to Brooke? But she's a girl. And you hate
her."</p>
<p>"No, I don't hate her. The opposite, in fact." She was calm; it felt
kind of good to finally get it out. "And yes, she's a girl," Sam
confirmed the obvious for Harrison.</p>
<p>"So you like her? Like, like her?" Wait. That would mean... "You
mean, the way my mom likes girls?" Harrison was having trouble
wrapping his mind around this.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"I know it's a lot to take in. I hardly knew how to process it myself."</p>
<p>Sam liked girls. Harrison's shoulders slumped as the realization sunk
in. What was it about Sam? And Brooke, too, for that matter.
Somewhere in a secret place inside him he had always thought that a
woman who combined the best attributes of both Sam and Brooke would be
the girl to whom he would completely lose his heart. Brooke had never
been an attainable goal, and now Sam was off limits too. He decided
to think about that later and get back to the situation at hand. Poor
Sam. And poor Brooke. "Sam, you have to tell her," Harrison grabbed
Sam's arm and spoke in an urgent tone.</p>
<p>Sam laughed like it was funny. "I can't tell her, I could barely tell
you, and I'm not ready to come out."</p>
<p>"No. You have to tell her that you wrote the letters, not Josh."</p>
<p>"No I don't. She'll never know it was me. I can work out a little
angst and Josh gets the credit. Neither Josh nor I have a problem
with that."</p>
<p>"But Brooke might have a problem with it."</p>
<p>Sam was silent. She had never thought of that. Then she came to a
decision. "No. If I told her, she would hate me. Well, hate me even
more than she already does. I absolutely cannot tell her. And this
is the only way I have of showing Brooke how I feel and I'm not
prepared to give it up yet."</p>
<p>The irony of Sam's attraction to the girl she tried so hard to despise
was not lost on Harrison. He thought he now understood what was
behind Sam's attacks on all that Brooke held sacred. It was the
lesbian high school equivalent to dunking her pigtails in an ink well,
although a lot more twisted. "Ah, Sam, that's totally sad."</p>
<p>"So you understand my predicament."</p>
<p>Did he ever. If he had zero chance of achieving the time of day with
Brooke McQueen, then the probability for Sam was somewhere down in the
negative triple digits. "Yeah. Normally I wouldn't say this to a
girl, but I think it's appropriate in this case: you poor dumb bastard."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Sam bleakly agreed.</p>

<chapter title="Part 4">
<p>The girls' gym was empty. For a brief window of time, from just after the dismissal bell rang until about twenty minutes past three, when the gymnastics team started trickling in for their practice, Brooke could usually count on this giant space to be as private as a confessional. She stood in her glamazon workout gear, leaning against a waist-high stack of practice mats, waiting for her tryst to begin. A moment later the heavy door slammed shut and the rhythmic click of cleats could be heard crossing the polished wood floor.</p>
<p>Josh approached in almost complete uniform; he carried his shoulder pads, and his scrimmage jersey was draped over his t-shirted shoulder. The sight of his dear face made Brooke smile, and he smiled back. It had been about six weeks since that first letter, and they were well and truly together again. It was not like before, when Brooke had been plagued by insecurities and always had half her mind on the image the two of them were presenting. She did not care about that anymore. All that mattered was this beautiful boy coming towards her. He had opened up to her in the only way he could, by sending her the contents of his heart in Times New Roman on cheap copy-paper, and she loved him so much for it.</p>
<p>They never talked about the letters; Josh made it clear in the beginning that they were not to be discussed. She received about two a week, always typed now after the first handwritten one. Although a hand-penned love letter was the standard, Brooke was secretly relieved not to have to stop and decipher Josh's illegible penmanship every few lines.</p>
<p>When Josh reached Brooke he touched her arm and hopped onto the mats, letting his legs dangle. "Hi," he said. "How was your day?"</p>
<p>Brooke wanted a kiss, but Josh did not presume anymore. "Fine. Lots of homework over the break, of course."</p>
<p>"Yeah, me too." Josh ran his hand up and down her back for a moment. "You're still having practice today even though there's no game tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"We have our cheering competition Friday, remember?" Brooke had told him; why couldn't he remember things that were important to her?</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah. I can't believe there's no game tomorrow. First time in I don't know how many years there won't be a game on Thanksgiving. We're going to my grandmom's. Be gone until Sunday night."</p>
<p>"You won't be around at all this weekend?" Brooke was bummed, although she didn't know why it mattered; she would be gone the whole time as well. She was leaving early Friday for the competition in San Diego and wouldn't be back until Sunday either.</p>
<p>"Nope," Josh shook his head.</p>
<p>"And I can't even call you. When are you getting a new cell phone?"</p>
<p>"As soon as I make some money to pay for one," Josh had left his phone in his jeans pocket and his mother had sent it through the wash.</p>
<p>"Can I call you at your grandmother's?"</p>
<p>Josh looked pained at the suggestion. "She's kind of weird about the phone bill and stuff."</p>
<p>"Instant messaging?"</p>
<p>"She doesn't have a computer."</p>
<p>"So we're incommunicado until Monday?"</p>
<p>"Looks like it."</p>
<p>"Will you write me a letter?" Brooke asked coyly, wrapping her arms around one of his.</p>
<p>The pained expression again. "Brooke, I thought we weren't going to talk about the letters."</p>
<p>Brooke couldn't understand why Josh refused to discuss his ardent, romantic letters with her. She knew he was both modest and shy, but to hide this remarkable talent under a bushel was such a shame. She supposed his fervent declarations were not very macho, and directly opposed to the jock image he successfully cultivated. It bothered her that he was happy to be perceived as stupid when he so obviously wasn't. "I know, but I can't help it. I just love them so much, and love knowing what you really think, and I want to be with you all the time."</p>
<p>"I'm glad. I want to be with you too," Josh looked into her eyes. "Can I kiss you?"</p>
<p>"Yes please," Brooke smiled. She lifted herself onto the practice mats and faced Josh. Their lips met in a tender kiss, a little more than chaste, but without much urgency. Nice and comfortable, Brooke thought, a cozy comfortable kiss. The kind of kiss I could spend the rest of my life with, she assured herself. Ever since that time in the library, Josh had been very solicitous of her feelings, not allowing himself to go too far. Brooke appreciated that.</p>
<p>When they separated, Josh lay back against the mats and stared at the ceiling. Brooke reclined on her side and supported her head with her hand, studying him. Something had changed in his demeanor and he looked morose. "What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," he replied in a monotone. Josh wanted nothing more than to make Brooke happy. And what made her happy was receiving the letters that he had been forced to continue accepting from Sam. He wanted to be the kind of guy who could write that kind of letter, to fashion a beautiful sentence that would explain how he felt about her, and know that the appreciative expression in her eyes was earned. He wasn't that kind of guy, but Brooke obviously loved them, and he wound up feeling guilty as hell. What could he do?</p>
<p>Brooke mistook his glumness for something altogether different. "Maybe one of these days we could both ditch practice after school and go somewhere to be alone. Would you like that?"</p>
<p>"Of course. I always want to be alone with you."</p>
<p>His genial response confused her. Wasn't he being moody because she wasn't putting out? She knew he was thinking about it; his letters skirted the issue but it was there, between the lines. And even though they hadn't been back together for very long, she wanted to be more intimate with him. Perhaps then they could be as close as she felt she was to him when she was reading his letters. "I was thinking about a different kind of alone. The kind that involves a hotel room, candlelight and a big bed," Brooke looked meaningfully at Josh.</p>
<p>Josh sat up on his elbows. "Really? You really want to?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she said simply, enjoying the sight of his dawning pleased expression. "Why don't we do it next week, after Thanksgiving and the competition, and after you come back from your grandmother's?"</p>
<p>"I think that's the best idea I've ever heard," Josh grinned.</p>
<p>"Good." Brooke leaned in and gave him a quick kiss. "I have to go; we're not practicing tomorrow so today's is going to be extra long."</p>
<p>"Okay. Will I see you before I leave tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. Call me tonight if your practice finishes before ours," Brooke said collecting her gear and heading for the door. "Or you can always write me a letter," she added, over her shoulder.</p>
<p>Josh laughed uncomfortably. "Maybe I will," he replied, knowing he would not.</p>
<hr/>
<p>"Happy Thanksgiving," Sam simultaneously knocked and pushed on the ajar door to Brooke's room. The sight of Brooke sitting on her bed reading one of her letters made Sam's heart leap a little.</p>
<p>"Hey, Happy Thanksgiving," returned Brooke, folding the letter and tucking it into a book. She stood up and faced her housemate, waiting for her to state her business. When she didn't, Brooke prompted her, "Did you want something?"</p>
<p>"My mother wanted me to ask if you wouldn't mind helping out with some of the dinner preparations. She's got the turkey in the oven but I guess that's just the tip of the iceberg," Sam said wryly. "Don't worry; I'm not getting out of it either. We'll both be slaves for the day."</p>
<p>Brooke looked at the clock on her night table. It was ten in the morning and they weren't eating until five. Were there really seven hours worth of kitchen tasks to accomplish? "I was just going to start packing for tomorrow. Can I come down in, like, an hour?"</p>
<p>"Sure, whatever," Sam replied nonchalantly. "Where are you going?"</p>
<p>Brooke sighed at Sam's nosiness, but answered politely. She should at least try to keep the peace on national holidays - for her father's sake. "I have a cheering competition in San Diego. I'll be gone until Sunday night."</p>
<p>The snarky comment she was expecting from Sam didn't come. In fact, there had been a distinct dearth of snark coming from the McPherson camp lately; she wondered why Sam was falling down on the job. Lack of inspiration, maybe?</p>
<p>"Oh. Good luck with that. See you later," was Sam's simple reply, and then she left.</p>
<p>Several hours later, after Brooke had procrastinated helping in the kitchen as long as possible, she went downstairs to find Jane putting on her coat.</p>
<p>"Oh good, Brooke, Sam could use some help," Jane reached for her purse as she imparted her instructions. "There's a list of things to do on the counter, if you wouldn't mind pitching in. I just have to run to the store and pick up a few more things. I shouldn't have left the shopping to your father. He bought canned cranberry sauce! Is that what you usually have on Thanksgiving?"</p>
<p>"Um, we usually just go out," Brooke said.</p>
<p>'Well, not this year. See you in a little while." Jane was out the door a minute later.</p>
<p>Brooke continued into the kitchen to find Sam at the newspaper-protected kitchen table, engaged in the process of separating a large number of potatoes from their skins.</p>
<p>She waved her potato peeler in greeting. "I hope you like mashed potatoes; we're going to have massive amounts of leftovers."</p>
<p>"What should I do?" Brooke asked, a bit uncomfortable with the prospect of being alone with Sam while Jane was out.</p>
<p>"Why don't you grab another peeler? I still have about," Sam gauged the quantity of potatoes that remained in front of her, "three pounds to go."</p>
<p>Brooke settled herself at the table and picked up a potato. She watched as Sam attacked the one she was holding, flicking at it rapidly with her peeler, sending brown bits of peel in all directions. Approaching the task with less frenzy, Brooke carefully and slowly worked the peeler, coaxing long and curly strands from the outer layer of the potato. They worked in silence, neither knowing how to initiate a civil conversation.</p>
<p>Sam observed Brooke covertly as they worked. She tried to analyze just what it was about Brooke that had captured her heart so thoroughly. Of course, Brooke was beautiful, but Sam thought her beauty was something incidental, a physical manifestation of her goodness. Sam saw how Brooke treated everyone else in the world except for her. Even to the lowliest and most socially-unconnected of her classmates, Brooke was polite and considerate. Parents loved her; she was respectful without being obsequious. It was only Sam whom she treated with anything less than decorum, a fact for which Sam - if she were honest with herself - could not fault her. Did she want to emulate that goodness or merely bask in its glow? She didn't know the answer to that question, only certain that she wanted some of that goodness to flow in her direction.</p>
<p>Distracted as she was, Sam didn't notice that Brooke had been making her own appraisal of her housemate. Brooke thought Sam slightly goofy as she sat with her legs wrapped around the rungs of her chair, hair done up in a loose, lopsided bun on the side of her head, tip of tongue slightly protruding from between her lips in concentration as she assaulted the potatoes. Once she was finished peeling, she carelessly dropped each one into a pot of cool water, usually splashing herself in the process. Where was the fearsome opponent she had come to regard with knee-jerk distrust?</p>
<p>There had been times since their forced cohabitation had begun when Brooke had absolutely loathed Sam, and then times when she had felt sorry for her. Once she remembered briefly feeling admiration for her, when she had done some selfless thing that Brooke would never have considered doing, but then Sam would commit the inevitable foul deed that would earn Brooke's suspicion again. After all the back and forth and up and down, Brooke could not manage the upheaval of reforming her opinion of Sam every few days; instead she now adopted a habitual, composed indifference - and that generally worked - except for the times when she had to swing back towards antipathy for one of Sam's malicious stunts against her.</p>
<p>Still, Sam seemed vulnerable right now; for once the girl had dropped the arrogant, blustery swagger she normally assumed. Perhaps, Brooke mused, Sam suffered from multiple personality disorder, and the dominant persona, that particularly aggravating one that so easily got under Brooke's skin, got the day off on national holidays. The absurdity of that notion struck Brooke as funny, and she smirked to herself. Sam, however, was busy counting the remaining potatoes and missed it.</p>
<p>Racking her brain for something clever to say had produced nothing for Sam except the beginnings of a headache. For reasons unknown to her, she picked up a large potato and pressed it against her forehead, then pushed it against her nose, enjoying the gritty cool feeling of dirt and earth on her face as she smushed it right against the tip, flattening it down to the cartilage. Realizing how strange she must appear, trying to merge her face with a potato, she didn't have to look to know that Brooke was regarding her with curiosity and perhaps concern for her sanity. Without removing the potato, Sam cut her eyes over to Brooke's and casually commented in a nasal voice, "I'm considering rhinoplasty. What do you think?"</p>
<p>Brooke looked surprised for half a beat, then she broke into loud guffaws, dropping her own peeler and half-naked spud onto the table helplessly as the mirth took hold. For some reason, she found Sam and her potato nose hilarious. She gurgled with laughter and pointed at Sam, even though Sam had lowered her potato-prosthetic. Sam was giggling and grinning at her accomplishment, which while not the suave witticism she had planned, had satisfactorily broken the ice. More than that, it was one of those rare moments of exquisite silliness that can reduce two people to simpering heaps. For the next ten minutes all they had to do was glance at each other and another wave of gleeful cackling commenced.</p>
<p>When Brooke had regained the power of speech, she said, "Miss Potato-head, charmed I'm sure," which unsurprisingly sent them back into paroxysms of giggles.</p>
<p>After their laughter died down and they were sufficiently relaxed, abdominals aching from the workout, Brooke caught Sam's eye. "You have some dirt just there," she reached out and Sam leaned in as Brooke brushed at her forehead.</p>
<p>Sam gloried in the contact, reluctantly pulling back after Brooke returned to her half-exposed potato.</p>
<p>"That really was funny, Sam," Brooke said. "I didn't know you had such a good sense of humor."</p>
<p>Sam thought about that for a minute. "Neither did I," she confessed. "I'm not normally known for bringing the funny." She didn't really think what she had done was all that funny; it was just a weird coincidence that they had both been so amused.</p>
<p>"You hide it pretty well, at least when I'm around," Brooke said. "Too busy cataloguing the injustices of the world, maybe."</p>
<p>Sam acknowledged Brooke's diplomatic way of calling her humorless with a nod of her head. Why argue with the truth? She guessed she really did need to lighten up. "My dad was a total cornball, always making jokes and cracking people up, my mom most of all. Maybe it's a latent trait that will develop."</p>
<p>"Do you take after your father in other ways?" Brooke asked, regarding Sam speculatively.</p>
<p>"Well, obviously, there's the journalism thing."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but do you think you began to write because he did? Or would you have been a writer even if you had never known that your father was?" Brooke had been thinking about some things lately that paralleled her question to Sam; it was what made her interested in Sam's answer.</p>
<p>"I do feel like it's more natural for me to write words down instead of saying them," Sam replied. "I get a lot more nervous just talking to someone, and do a lot more self-censoring. I feel freer to write what I truly think when there is that separation between me and the person I'm communicating with." Sam soberly gazed at Brooke. "Does that make sense?"</p>
<p>"I think it answers my question. Writing must be in your genes."</p>
<p>"If I couldn't write it would be like losing one of my senses," Sam said, cringing at the dramatic turn of phrase. But she was determined to be honest now, even though so many of her dealings with Brooke were undertaken with the aim to obfuscate. Sam was thrilled to be having such a personal, serious discussion with the object of her affection. Somehow, they had both let their guard down at the same time, like opposing soldiers meeting in no-man's land on Christmas day to share smokes and a chat. For however long it lasted, Sam was determined to keep the conversational peace. "Did you inherit many of the qualities of your parents, do you think?"</p>
<p>"My dad and I are a lot alike, I guess," Brooke said, her eyebrows furrowed. "But I honestly don't know about my mother." She stopped what she was doing and gazed levelly at Sam. "Do you think I'm destined to be like her?"</p>
<p>Sam took her time considering the question, watching Brooke carefully. She didn't know how to answer and didn't want to get it wrong.</p>
<p>"I mean," Brooke elaborated, taking Sam's circumspection for confusion, "do you think it's, like, a predetermined thing? That it's not possible for me to be a good wife and mother because she failed at is so miserably?" With everything that was happening between her and Josh, she needed reassurance that she could do right by him. While Sam was not the ideal person to ask, and perhaps she would regret it later, this fleeting atmosphere of openness allowed her to disregard her natural distrust. Besides, there was no one else to ask. This was not a question Nicole would ever take seriously.</p>
<p>"I think what your mom did was make a choice," Sam said gently. "Her choices don't pass down to you genetically. She is responsible for the things she has done, and you are responsible for the things you do. Because you have witnessed the damage her actions have done, I would think you are even less likely to behave the way she did."</p>
<p>"Really?" Brooke asked, looking at Sam with relief, and watched her nod emphatically. She thought she owed Sam some explanation for the heavy turn the conversation had taken. "You know that Josh and I are back together, right?"</p>
<p>Sam nodded hesitantly, not wanting to devote even one word of this precious conversation to the subject of Josh.</p>
<p>"I would just hate to think that I was going into a situation with the odds stacked against me, you know? Because it's not just me I have to think about, Josh deserves someone who can be the best wife and mother she can be."</p>
<p>"Whoa, wait. You're getting married?" Sam was incredulous.</p>
<p>"Not right away!" Brooke laughed. "But eventually, yeah."</p>
<p>"But how do you even know that he's the right one?" Sam asked, thinking it a valid question despite her intensely vested interest.</p>
<p>"Ever since we got back together it's been so different than it was before," Brooke gushed. "He's the same in many ways, but he's also showing me this other side, this mature, loving, romantic, private side. It's amazing!"</p>
<p>"Wow. That was almost like a cheer. Put your pom-poms down, Miss Cheerleader, we're just talking here." Sam said.</p>
<p>But Brooke had warmed to her subject. "He deserves his own cheer! Sam, you would not believe how different he is underneath the jock exterior. He is the most beautiful person. So warm-hearted and generous and kind -- and the soul of a poet. He's smart too; you know that after tutoring him. He probably just needed you to help him focus, because I know for a fact that he is brilliant. He sends me these incredible, miraculous letters. And handsome," Brooke chattered away. "With those gorgeous blue eyes and broad shoulders, his children are going to be adorable!"</p>
<p>"He sounds perfect," Sam said dejectedly, realizing that Brooke had fallen in love with her brain and Josh's body: the recipe for the ideal man. The tangle of implications her secret communications to Brooke caused was beginning to hit home, but Sam couldn't' stop to think about them as Brooke continued.</p>
<p>"You know how people think women shouldn't be just stay-at-home moms and homemakers any more? I think that's a lot of crap. What could be more fulfilling than devoting your life to taking care of your husband and raising his children? It's the ultimate expression of love, don't you think?" Brooke dreamily asked.</p>
<p>"No, I don't think," Sam answered, a bit annoyed. "You are totally intelligent, Brooke. Why in the world would you want to waste your brain being a Stepford wife?"</p>
<p>"I don't expect you to understand, Sam. We all know who the go-getter is in this family. It's not what I want. I would be perfectly content in the cute little house with the white picket fence, loving wife and mother, raising 2.4 children."</p>
<p>Sam wrestled with the impulse to continue arguing with Brooke, then decided to let it go in favor of keeping this newfound peace. "If that's what you want then I hope you get it," she said sincerely, feeling guilty that Brooke's perfect image of Josh didn't quite match up with his reality.</p>
<p>"Thanks," Brooke appreciated Sam's support, unlikely though it seemed. She collected a new potato and began peeling. A thought suddenly occurred to her. Josh might expect her to make Thanksgiving dinner one day, here was a perfect learning opportunity. "So what do we do once we've peeled all these potatoes?"</p>
<p>Although a lingering sense of dismay at the largeness of the monster she had created remained, Sam was glad to move on to a topic that didn't involve navigating layers of subterfuge. "We boil 'em until you can stick a fork through them. Then mash 'em up with lots of butter and cream and salt and pepper," she replied. "But we still have..." she reached over and plucked her mother's list from the counter, "... a casserole and the stuffing to make, not to mention dessert."</p>
<p>Just then Jane returned, walking into the kitchen with a bag from the grocery store, and surveyed the scene. She immediately began to marshal her forces. "Hi girls. The potatoes are almost finished? The store was still crazy with people buying last minute things for dinner." She looked into a pot on the stove. "Sam, would you add some more water to the giblets? And Brooke, do you want to make the cranberry sauce?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Jane. Will you teach me? I probably should know how to do it," Brooke jumped up to help with the groceries.</p>
<p>Jane was surprised at Brooke's change of heart. She thought the girl had been exhibiting signs of reluctance when she left. But she welcomed the help. "Sure, Brooke." Jane looked to where Sam was finishing the last potato. It was more familiar for Jane to order her daughter around. "Then Sam, after the giblets, you want to start chopping celery and onions for the stuffing?"</p>
<p>"Okay," Sam obliged. She was a little sorry that the dynamic in the kitchen had changed, but was relieved too. Her conversation with Brooke had given her much food for thought, but at that moment all she wanted was to not think about anything except the mindless instructions on a recipe card. But while she was not thinking, she could enjoy the view of a happy Brooke moving about the kitchen, and tell herself that she was partly responsible for that happiness.</p>
