<!-- Halloween \ Part Five -->

<p>Brooke slowly wheeled her shopping cart down the candy aisle. Adhering to her finely honed avoidance techniques, she had decided to stop and pick up more stuff for the party after school. Her head had been in a whirl since yesterday in the garage, and she still wasn't ready to see Sam. She left yesterday and went to the mall, wandered around, and maybe for the first time ever, couldn't concentrate on shopping at all. She called Nic and brought some movies to her house, where they sat and veged in front of the TV for hours. She hadn't comprehended much of what she saw, but it was nice to just sit there quietly and not think. When Brooke returned home shortly after midnight, she crept silently upstairs and successfully avoided Sam.</p>
<p>Sam had already left for school when Brooke got up this morning, it seemed she wasn't the only one employing evasion tactics. It continued that way in school, as well. By some weird coincidence, Sam had cut Physics and Brooke had ditched English, their only shared classes. She had seen Sam fleetingly at lunch, but throughout the day she seemed to have a kind of internal radar, or anti-Samdar, she supposed, that guided her away from potential sightings.</p>
<p>Here was the thing. She had now had two sexual partners, and neither of them had made her feel as much as thirty seconds spent with Sam under decades old butt-ugly drapes. It had been rather enlightening, to say the least. She hadn't actually known that a kiss could be like that. When Sam kissed her, she felt her body react in a way she had never experienced before. She had been engulfed in flames and Sam's lips were the tinder. If she hadn't removed herself from Sam's nearness, she was sure she would have made a big fat fool of herself. Even now, thinking about it was making her flushed and jittery.</p>
<p>So now, Brooke had some things to think about. First off, she didn't know what Sam was thinking. Was it just a spur of the moment experiment? Did she maybe feel the same thing that Brooke felt when they kissed? If she did, what did Sam envision happening now? What did Brooke herself want? Did this mean she liked all girls, or just Sam? Wait. Back the truck up. She liked Sam?</p>
<p>Yes, she did, she realized with astonishing clarity right there between the Gummy Mummies and the Wax Lips. No, she didn't like her; she loved her. Brooke exhaled. It felt like she had been holding her breath for a long, long time, and she could finally relax. Everything was falling into place, and she knew why she did all the things she did, and acted the strange ways she had, and said the stupid things she said, and instigated all those wonderful knockdown drag outs with Sam. It was all because of love. Twisted, really. She grinned goofily and laughed with delight, not noticing the odd looks she was getting from her fellow shoppers.</p>
<p>She started throwing things in her cart, intent on getting the hell out of there and back home as quickly as possible. When she wheeled her cart around and sped towards the checkout a thought occurred to her. What if Sam didn't love her back? She skidded to a stop. Well, she reasoned, she must feel something if she went and planted one like that on me. Brooke began pushing her trolley again with increasing speed. There was only one way to find out. Avoidance was now a thing of the past.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"It's so cool that Halloween falls on a Friday this year," Carmen remarked as she and Lily hung a string of mini jack-o-lantern lights around the McQueen/McPherson living room.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it was such a drag doing homework after trick-or-treating when we were kids," Lily said</p>
<p>"Is Josh going to be able to make it tonight, Lil?" Sam asked, seated on the floor blowing up orange and black balloons.</p>
<p>"Yep, he's working this afternoon until six, and I get the night off," Lily replied cheerily. Lily and Josh's respective jobs, Mr. Cluck's and the Sport Spot, left the newlyweds with little time to themselves, but moving back in with Lily's mom had eased their burdens somewhat.</p>
<p>"That's good," Sam said, rather unenthusiastically.</p>
<p>"Sam, what's wrong with you?" Lily asked. "You have been excited for this party for weeks and now that it's finally here, you're acting all indifferent."</p>
<p>"I don't know, I'm just not in the holiday spirit yet," Sam sighed.</p>
<p>Sam was still cursing herself for her monumental blunder yesterday. But, she mused, if not for her stupidity, she might never have known what it felt like to kiss Brooke. And that was worth whatever fallout was coming. She just wished it would come, already. Sam was tired of this evasion crap. If Brooke wanted to never speak to her again, she wanted to get started with it right away. At least she would be out of this limbo, and could focus solely on her misery.</p>
<p>Just then the doorbell rang. Sam stopped blowing up balloons and went to answer it. She grabbed the bowl of candy by the door and swung it open to find a passel of Hulks, Spidermen and Harry Potters, just as she had all afternoon. Kids have no imagination, she groused. "Wow, you guys all look great," she patronized, nearly drowned out by a chorus of 'trick-or-treats.' As she doled out the candy to the voracious hordes, she spied Brooke coming up the walk loaded down with bags. Brooke raised her head and their eyes locked. Sam suddenly had trouble breathing.</p>
<p>"Trick-or-treat," Brooke said quietly, as the children dispersed to the next house.</p>
<p>"Looks like you have all the treats," Sam said, gesturing to the clear plastic bags plainly revealing the booty of candy Brooke was holding. This family will be eating Milky Ways until June, she thought.</p>
<p>"From you I would expect a trick, except I think you gave it to me yesterday," Brooke answered, her expression inscrutable.</p>
<p>"Brooke-"</p>
<p>"Hey Brooke," Carmen said, coming up behind Sam. "Why don't you come in and take a load off?"</p>
<p>"Hi, Carmen. I would if Sam here would let me through the door."</p>
<p>Sam wordlessly stepped aside and quickly raised her arms as Brooke dumped the bags of candy into them as she passed. Sam carried the candy into the kitchen and found a home for it in the closet-sized pantry. She stood in the small space lost in thought. If she thought she could see which way the wind was blowing from Brooke's attitude, she was dead wrong. Her always-suspect powers of observation had failed her once again.</p>
<p>Brooke pulled the pantry door open, scaring Sam half to death and asked, "Are you getting the carving things, Sam?"</p>
<p>"The what?" Sam was wholly discombobulated.</p>
<p>"For the jack-o-lanterns. I thought we could do them here in the kitchen." Brooke was looking at Sam intently, as were Lily and Carmen.</p>
<p>"Sam, what are you doing in there?" Lily questioned.</p>
<p>"Putting the candy away," she muttered, as she went out to the back patio. She started awkwardly lugging one of the pumpkins into the kitchen. "A little help here," she complained as the others watched her in amusement.</p>
<p>Several days ago, Sam and Brooke had gone to a pumpkin farm and picked out four of the biggest, roundest pumpkins they could find. They both loved the annual pumpkin carving tradition. Oh to be that pumpkin, Sam remembered thinking as she watched Brooke fondle one of them. What heady days of innocence those were, she now thought bemusedly.</p>
<p>Carmen took pity and went to help her retrieve the other pumpkins and the four of them attacked their squash in their own style. Brooke had a pumpkin carving kit, and created an elaborate, although scary, visage for her pumpkin. Lily carved a slogan onto her pumpkin, it read, 'Eat Pumpkins, Not Cows. Boo.' Carmen used a cat stencil from Brooke's kit, and Sam went the traditional route. Hers had triangles for the eyes and nose and a gap-toothed grin, always a classic. Brooke found candles to put in them, and they placed the jack-o-lanterns strategically around the house, ready to be lit when the festivities began.</p>
<p>Ever organized, Sam got her list out to see how preparations were proceeding. "Decorations? Check. Pumpkins? Check. Candy? That would be check times five," she said, eyeing Brooke. "Music, Sugar Daddy is taking care of. Food and drink, it's still a little too early to set up, so that about covers it for now."</p>
<p>Lily and Carmen gathered up their things, preparing to leave.</p>
<p>"Thanks, you guys, for all your help," Sam said sincerely.</p>
<p>"Yeah, the decorations look awesome," Brooke, agreed.</p>
<p>"Well, I can't wait for tonight so I can finally see what Sam's costume is," Carmen said, hinting at Sam to spill.</p>
<p>"You guys, it's not that special," Sam protested. "You're all going to be, 'That's it?' when you see it."</p>
<p>"Still, the suspense is killing us," Lily said.</p>
<p>Sam groaned.</p>
<p>The girls heard the front door close and a minute later Brooke's dad walked into the kitchen. "Hi, girls, this place looks downright ghoulish," he joked.</p>
<p>Carmen and Lily took this as their cue to leave; they would be back in a few hours, with costumes on.</p>
<p>When they were alone in the kitchen, Mike turned to the girls and asked, "Do either of you know what that fabric covered mound in the garage is?"</p>
<p>Brooke was surprised to learn that the fort was still standing. She wanted to be there now with Sam, repeating yesterday's events. "It's our fort, dad. Isn't it cool?" she gooned, knowing she sounded like she was five.</p>
<p>"Yes, honey, it's way cool," Mike replied, trying to be hip, and failing utterly. "But I need you to take it down. There's no way I'm leaving my car outside tonight."</p>
<p>"Okay Mike, we'll take care of it," Sam said, she hadn't thought about mischief-makers.</p>
<p>The doorbell rang. Mike grinned at them and said, "Ooh, trick-or-treaters!" And left the room.</p>
<p>Brooke turned to Sam. "I don't want to take down the fort. I want to go back in there with you, cat pee Christmas stink and all."</p>
<p>"Me too," Sam breathed, completely distracted by the amazing flecks of gold in Brooke's eyes, before she snapped out of it. "We can always build another one. Don't worry; I'll take care of it. It won't take me long to get ready, and we all know you'll take an age to become Trinity."</p>
<p>Brooke realized she still had to do her hair. "Thanks, Sam," she said, and then, "Won't take long to get ready, huh?" Come on Sam, tell me, please," Brooke pleaded.</p>
<p>"Big Bird," Sam said off the top of her head. "It won't take long to put on my big bird head and my big bird body. I wanted to be Oscar the Grouch; I was crestfallen when they told me they were out of him," she improvised.</p>
<p>"Crestfallen?" Brooke asked, amused by the word.</p>
<p>"Yep," Sam replied, "my crests totally fell."</p>
<p>Brooke just shook her head and laughed. "You goof." She was glad they had slid back into their easy, joking style of friendship. Things had been touch and go there when she first got home, she hadn't been able to get a bead on Sam's behavior. But she couldn't settle for being just friends with Sam. They had to talk, but now was not the time.</p>
<p>"So get moving, Trinity. I want to be shocked and awed when I look at you," Sam said, as she headed for the garage. No need to tell her that's a given, she thought.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam made short work of dismantling the fort. As she folded the fabric and stacked the lawn chairs, she thought back to past Halloweens with Harrison always her trick-or-treating partner. It was times like this that she missed the friendship she lost a great deal. She looked at her watch and made a decision.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Harrison opened the door with a bowl of candy in his hands, expecting to see the latest batch of superheroes at the door. "Sam," he said, surprised.</p>
<p>"Hi Harrison," Sam smiled</p>
<p>Harrison stepped out onto the porch. He hadn't realized how much he had missed Sam until she was standing there in front of him. He resisted the urge to hug her. They sat down on the top step of the porch, the bowl of candy between them.</p>
<p>I was just thinking about that Halloween when we were twelve. Do you remember?" Sam asked, a little bit shy after their estrangement.</p>
<p>"Of course. You were Batman and I was Robin, and you promised that next year I could be Batman and you would be Robin." Harrison smiled at the memory.</p>
<p>"And then the next year we were too cool for Halloween, and we stayed here and jealously gave out candy to everybody else," Sam laughed at their idiocy. "Sorry you never got to be Batman," she added.</p>
<p>They were both silent, then Sam continued. "I'm really sorry about what happened between you and Brooke. I should have been there for you."</p>
<p>"Well I wasn't exactly Mr. Approachable, now was I? And awkward doesn't even begin to describe the situation."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know," Sam sighed. "But now, maybe we can hang out some time, I've really missed your friendship, Harrison." She paused. "You want to come to the party tonight? You know you're invited."</p>
<p>"Thanks Sammy, but I don't think it's a good idea," Harrison shot her a sidelong glance. "I doubt Brooke wants to see my face, I wasn't too nice to her the last time we talked."</p>
<p>"She told me," Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"She did?" he asked, surprised.</p>
<p>"She feels terrible. She doesn't know why she would behave so meanly towards you."</p>
<p>"Yes, she does. It's the same reason why you let Brooke and I go to the prom together," Harrison said flatly.</p>
<p>Sam just looked at Harrison for a minute. "How'd you get so smart?" she finally asked.</p>
<p>She clapped him on the knee and stood up. "Think about the party, okay? You're more than welcome." She took a Butterfinger for the road.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke stood in front of the mirror in her room. She was having a problem with her costume and it was freaking her out.</p>
<p>There was a knock on the door and she heard Sam call out, "Brooke? Are you decent?"</p>
<p>She's going to find out sooner or later, Brooke heaved a sigh and said, "Come in."</p>
<p>Sam opened the door and stopped in her tracks after she crossed the threshold. She absently closed the door behind her as she took in the view in front of her. Brooke stood there resplendent in head-to-toe black vinyl. She had put a dark rinse in her hair and slicked it back, tying it back at the nape of her neck. A long black trench coat covered a black tank that fit like a second skin, and tight, shiny trousers encased her legs down to black boots. Sam gulped. "You are a sight-"</p>
<p>"For sore eyes?" Brooke finished. "Yeah, thanks. I'm also a sound for sore ears. Listen." She walked across the room towards Sam. With every step she took the black vinyl of her costume made a creaking, sitting-on-a-new-leather-couch-in-shorts kind of noise.</p>
<p>Sam couldn't help the smirk, but managed to stifle her laughter in the face of Brooke's distress. "I was going to say behold."</p>
<p>"What?" Brooke asked, nonplussed.</p>
<p>"I was going to say, 'You are a sight to behold,' before I was so rudely interrupted," Sam said. "You are stunning."</p>
<p>"Thanks," Brooke said ruefully, looking at Sam with a half smile on her face.</p>
<p>Since it appeared that Brooke was now seeing the humor in the situation, Sam felt it was okay to laugh. Brooke did some experimental walking around while Sam tried to control herself, but every step was making her laugh harder.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. I'm sorry," Sam finally regained her composure. "It's better than a bell around your neck. I'll always be able to find you."</p>
<p>"Ha ha," Brooke said glumly.</p>
<p>"Maybe some talcum powder in strategic places?" Sam suggested.</p>
<p>"No, it would ruin the shininess," Brooke sighed, mock self-pityingly. "Oh well, so much for having the hot costume this year."</p>
<p>"Brooke, you are going to be the hottest one here. You are hotness personified. You are ten pounds of hot in a five-pound bag. You're so hot you could melt all this stuff," Sam babbled, realizing she sounded less than coherent.</p>
<p>"Really, Sam? Tell me how you really feel," Brooke said, pleased, as she stood directly in front of Sam, maybe a foot of space between them. She could feel the heat Sam's body was throwing off, and she felt her heart begin to pound.</p>
<p>Oh God, I want to, Sam thought. "Brooke, about yesterday," Sam began, apropos of nothing. "I want to apologize for... what happened. I know I freaked you out and I'm sorry. It won't happen again."</p>
<p>Finally, she brings it up. "You didn't freak me out," Brooke said.</p>
<p>"But you-"</p>
<p>"And it better happen again, in fact I want it to happen again right now." Brooke closed the distance between them and pulled Sam into her arms. Sam reveled in the feel of the slick material as she slid her hands under Brooke's jacket and encircled her waist. Their lips were just about to touch when there was a knock on the door.</p>
<p>"Girls, are you ready? We want to take pictures before we're banished to our room," Mike said through the door.</p>
<p>"Good grief! This is like some horrible French farce," Brooke leaned her forehead against Sam's, then stepped away from her. "And you're not even ready McPherson!" Noting for the first time that Sam was dressed as she was earlier. Observant much, Brooke?</p>
<p>Sam just stood there stupidly while Brooke went over to the door and opened it to her father and said, "I'm ready, but Sam's not. Let's leave her alone so she can change."</p>
<p>Sam followed the two as far as her own room and watched as they made their way downstairs. As they walked away she heard Mike comment on Brooke's costume.</p>
<p>"You look nice, honey. Are you supposed to be a dominatrix?"</p>
<p>"Daddy!"</p>
<p>"What's making that noise, is that you?"</p>
<p>"Dad!"</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam removed the dress bag from her closet, carefully removing the red floor length evening gown. When she tried it on in the consignment shop, the saleslady had confirmed what she thought. The dress bore a striking similarity to the one Julia Roberts wore in Pretty Woman. It was ruby-colored crepe de chine, off the shoulder, with a fitted bodice and flow-y skirt that trailed behind her. Sam knew when she saw it that she wanted to wear it, Halloween or no. The fact that is resembled some movie star's wardrobe was a bonus. She could've always been a construction worker if all she needed was a costume, but it did feel good knowing she had found a sexy smurf-free alternative.</p>
<p>Amazingly, the dress hadn't needed to be altered, and the kind saleslady packed it in such a way that it had very few wrinkles. It was a miracle dress. White elbow-length gloves and some costume jewelry completed the look.</p>
<p>Now looking at the dress again, she was apprehensive as to whether she could pull this off. Who was she kidding? A glamour girl she was not. Not like Brooke. Brooke. What had just happened? Brooke wanted to kiss her. Sam would be happy to oblige her at the first opportunity. But what did it mean? Sam decided to not think about it for the moment, but couldn't stop a silly grin from overtaking her features.</p>
<p>Sam tried to pull her hair into an approximation of a sweeping, Hepburn-esque, elegant up-do, with mixed results. Next was makeup, not too shabby, she appraised herself in the mirror. Then she carefully pulled the dress over her head and struggled to get the thing zipped. After contorting her body in a variety of positions, it was done. Now, shoes. Shoes! She forgot shoes. The last pair of dress shoes she had was from the prom, but they had been ruined. She considered her options: flip-flops, sneakers, or boots. She grabbed the sneakers, figuring they wouldn't make noise like slappy flip-flops or clompy boots, but then if she were anywhere near Brooke she wouldn't have to worry about that, she snickered to herself.</p>
<p>Okay. Ready. She looked at herself in the mirror one last time and turned to go. Why am I so nervous?</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke was setting out snacks in the living room when she heard Jane say, "Wow Sam, that's some costume."</p>
<p>Brooke spun around to see Sam descending the staircase in an elegant ruby colored evening gown.</p>
<p>They all watched as Sam stopped in front of them and struck a pose, smiling radiantly. Even Mac, dressed up in a bumblebee costume, cooed with delight in her baby chair.</p>
<p>Mike said, "You look just like the woman in that movie..." He snapped his fingers trying to recall.</p>
<p>"...Pretty Woman." Brooke finished for him. She simply stared at the transformation Sam had wrought in fifteen minutes. She looked like a different person. There was no trace of the urban bike-messenger chic Sam normally espoused, and in its place was sophisticated glamour. She was breathtaking. Sam might have been wearing clothes similar to a movie character, but Brooke thought she completely inhabited them as herself. Julia who? Brooke took in her appearance from head to toe. The girl standing before her looked every inch the alluring, elegant, cosmopolitan woman. Except for her shoes. "Sam, please tell me you're not wearing sneakers?"</p>
<p>Sam's face deflated before their eyes. "It was these or my flip-flops, Squeaky," Sam scowled. This was not the impression she had hoped to make on Brooke. She had been watching Brooke watch her since she entered the room and thought her costume met with the girl's approval. Evidently not. She pushed her hair out of her eyes for what seemed like the eighth time in the last minute. The hair was definitely not working.</p>
<p>Brooke belatedly grasped the fact that Sam wasn't privy to her thoughts, and stupidly, the first thing that had come out of her mouth was negative. She stepped up to Sam and said, "Here, let me help you with your hair."</p>
<p>Brooke stood in front of Sam and raised her arms to her head. She removed a few bobby pins and quickly repaired the hairstyle. As she worked, she looked into Sam's eyes and mouthed, "Sorry."</p>
<p>Sam melted in response. She was getting awfully warm, due to Brooke's proximity. Brooke's hands in her hair were causing all kinds of tingly sensations. She cleared her throat and tried to think about vectors.</p>
<p>When Brooke finished Mike had his camera out, ready to burn through a roll or two of film. While Sam and Brooke said cheese, Brooke thought of something.</p>
<p>"Jane, do you have any other Halloween pictures of Sam?" she asked, innocently. "Particularly, last year?"</p>
<p>"No, she doesn't," Sam loudly spoke over whatever no-doubt embarrassing thing her mother was about to say.</p>
<p>"Sam," Jane scolded, before continuing. "I have pictures from every year, I think." Jane thought for a moment. "I have a darling picture of Sam when she was six. She had a cowgirl costume that she loved, and wore for months after Halloween. She would never take it off. Sam would wear that gun holster to bed, if we let her," she remembered fondly, smiling at her daughter.</p>
<p>Sam rolled her eyes, but was secretly warmed by the memory.</p>
<p>"Brooke did the same thing with a ballerina costume when she was around that age, too," Mike said. "After awhile she would just wear the tutu with whatever she had on. But we couldn't even get it away from her to wash it. The thing became filthy with grape jelly and god knows what until I think it just disintegrated."</p>
<p>"Dad! Shut up!" Brooke was mortified. She looked askance at Sam, who was smiling at her, utterly charmed. Brooke grinned like an imbecile.</p>
<p>Mike shot the last photo of them smiling into each other's eyes and finally put the camera down. He looked at his watch. "Okay, Jane, should we adjourn to our room? Their guests should be arriving any minute."</p>
<p>"Girls, we'll be right upstairs if things get out of control, and remember no guests allowed upstairs," Jane warned as she collected Mac. "Have a great time, you both look wonderful."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke faced Sam and said "You look... words are failing me here. Fantastic. Incredible. Amazing. I'm sorry I didn't say it before."</p>
<p>"Those words are succeeding for me," Sam said, shyly.</p>
<p>"You really do look wonderful, Sam, but I now have this image of you in bed wearing nothing but a gun holster," Brooke said as she stepped into the circle of Sam's arms.</p>
<p>"Yippi-ki-yi-yay." Sam replied as their lips met in a smoldering kiss.</p>
<p>Sam breathlessly pulled away several moments later and said, "How much do you want to bet that the doorbell is going to ring right now?"</p>
<p>And then, as if on cue, it did.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The party was in full swing, it seemed half of Kennedy High had shown up. At the turntables was Sugar Daddy, dressed in his usual big pimpin' style with the addition of a band-aid on his left cheek. He was telling everyone that he was Nelly for Halloween.</p>
<p>Sam was in the kitchen breaking up a bag of ice with a hammer, elbow-length gloves discarded for practicality's sake. The beverages were going faster than expected. Ice chips were spraying everywhere and Carmen, Lily and Josh, who were helping, had their hands up for protection.</p>
<p>"Is a Pretty Woman supposed to be wielding a hammer like that?" Lily snarked. Although all admitted that Sam looked wonderful, she was still the butt of many jokes.</p>
<p>"I don't think a Pretty Woman should be wearing sneakers," Josh added, grinning.</p>
<p>"Guys," Carmen explained as if to extremely stupid people, "she's wearing sneakers because in a few years she's going to be the Runaway Bride."</p>
<p>Sam took her licks graciously, nodding and smiling, but raised her hammer threateningly and said "Careful, you don't want me to go all Erin Brockovich on your asses."</p>
<p>"What're you going to do, sue us to death?" Carmen asked. "You know we love you, it's just weird to see you all glammed up like this," she put her arm around Sam's shoulders.</p>
<p>"Me glammed up? What about you Carm? Your costume is showing maximum flaposity, " Sam dorked. She didn't know why Carm's flapper outfit inspired such non-wit.</p>
<p>"And then we have the anti-glam contingent," Carmen said motioning to Josh and Lily, dressed, or not dressed, as Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>"Hey, don't knock it," Lily said defensively. "Two swimsuits and sixteen bucks worth of fake leaves, we're talking value for money." Lily stopped talking when she saw Sam's attention shift to the doorway, where Brooke strode in, closely followed by Nicole and Mary Cherry.</p>
<p>Mary Cherry went straight to the ice and dumped a chunk into her punch. "Why Spam, don't you shine up like a new twenty? You could give Lil' Lily a run for her money lookin' like that." She looked at Lily and gave her a big wink, "Just kiddin' Lily. Aren't you cold, hun?"</p>
<p>Lily didn't reply.</p>
<p>"Thanks Mary Cherry," Sam responded politely. "What's your costume supposed to be?"</p>
<p>"This," Mary Cherry displayed herself like she was at the auto show, "is an exact replica of the Bob Mackie creation as worn by the goddess-chanteuse Cher at the Oscars for her 1987 win for Best Actress in the movie Moonstruck for her portrayal of the extremely lifelike but not very pretty Loretta Castorini."</p>
<p>Blank looks all around. "Oh," Carmen finally said, "I thought you were a spider."</p>
<p>"Spam, you're running out of drinks out there, hun. We need you to be a little less Pretty Woman and lot more Mary Reilly, thank you," Nicole butted in with her usual condescending tone.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" For once, Sam had nothing. No comeback. "Well, I hate you and your ass face." How utterly lame, but who could dis the material girl?</p>
<p>Nicole was dressed as Madonna, circa her "Express Yourself" video days, and she looked good. Her stylish double-breasted black pinstriped pantsuit over vintage Couture Jean-Paul Gaultier bustier was letter perfect, and the platinum blonde hair was flawless. The monocle was fun, too.</p>
<p>"Come on, Sam," Brooke said as she loaded Sam and herself up with beverages and led her away to the cooler where they dumped them in. She looked at Sam. I think there's a problem in the bathroom."</p>
<p>"A problem?"</p>
<p>"Yes, a big problem."</p>
<p>"We should go check it out. It's the responsible thing to do."</p>
<p>Brooke took Sam's hand and squeaked her way through the masses of teens hopped up on caffeine, candy and other substances, past the long line already waiting to use the facilities, and snuck in as the previous occupant was just exiting. She turned to the understandably pissed off guy who was next in line, "It's our house. We have to do an hourly sweep. It'll be just a minute."</p>
<p>No sooner had she locked the door than Sam slammed her against it, wrapping her arms around Brooke's neck and hungrily devouring her lips. Brooke took Sam's face in her hands and kissed her back with an intensity fueled by frustration. As Sam started to slowly kiss a hot trail down Brooke's neck, Brooke moaned, "Who are all these people? Why are they in our house?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," Sam said hazily between kisses. " I hate them all."</p>
<p>They heard a knock at the door. "Just a minute," Sam called out.</p>
<p>Brooke pulled Sam's face back up so she could taste her lips again. She needed those lips. She ran her hands down Sam's back before settling on her waist, straining to pull her closer, she wanted no space between them. Sam pressed her hips into Brooke's, making her moan loudly. Sam's eyes widened and she covered Brooke's mouth with her own to quiet her.</p>
<p>The knocking began again and didn't stop.</p>
<p>Brooke raised her head and banged it lightly on the door in aggravation "JUST. A. MINUTE!" she roared.</p>
<p>The knocking stopped.</p>
<p>Sam buried her face in Brooke's neck, trying to suppress the giggles that were inevitably to come. Brooke could feel Sam smiling against her skin and started snickering as well. Soon they were doubled over and leaning on each other for support.</p>
<p>When they had composed themselves somewhat, they looked in the mirror to survey the damage. Not only were there raccoon eyes to deal with, but Sam's lipstick had somehow transferred itself to Brooke's neck and both girls' hair needed some serious fixing.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, pissed-off-boy was finally allowed in the bathroom.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Yo, ladies, this party was off the hizzle," Sugar Daddy, their last guest, said as he was leaving, it had taken him awhile to pack up his music and equipment.</p>
<p>"It shizzle wizzle, SD," Sam replied, hoping it made sense in whatever language she was now speaking. Sugar Daddy saw himself out, and the girls flopped onto the couch next to each other, weary from the day.</p>
<p>Then Sam got up and walked over to their own stereo. When she returned to Brooke she held out her hand. "Listen, Brooke, they're playing our song."</p>
<p>Brooke heard the opening bars of a certain Mariah Carey tune. She took Sam's hand and they began to sway to the music.</p>
<p>"Actually, this can't be our song," Sam corrected herself. "It's about some stalker-chick who is in total denial over this guy. Completely inappropriate."</p>
<p>"How would you know? You said you never listen to her," Brooke reminded.</p>
<p>"I didn't until last night, when I snuck into your room while you were out and played it, like, three hundred times. Where'd you go anyway?</p>
<p>"I was out getting used to the idea that I had fallen for this person who is my former worst enemy, current best friend, and all-around amazing girl who occasionally geeks out and likes to bob for apples." Brooke couldn't hold back telling Sam how she felt.</p>
<p>Sam was suffused with unadulterated joy, but she was at a loss. How did she say what was in her heart? For someone with a supposed way with words, she was shockingly inarticulate right now. So she stalled for time. "We never bobbed for apples," she said instead, forlornly.</p>
<p>Brooke gave her a rueful smile and said, "What a geek."</p>
<p>Sam was giddy with happiness. She squeezed Brooke to her and started spinning them around, finally satisfying that long held desire. They laughed breathlessly as Sam slowed them down. "This song is impossible to dance to," she complained, and then started singing loudly along with Mariah, "You and I will always be, you and I will always be."</p>
<p>"Singing and dancing to Mariah Carey," Brooke chuckled. "What will the neighbors think?"</p>
<p>"They'll think that every great love story needs to end with a song and dance number. Or at least this one does," Sam said, hoping the love shining in her eyes was apparent to Brooke.</p>
<p>"End? Don't you mean begin?" Brooke could see all she needed to know in Sam's expression.</p>
<p>"Right. I stand happily corrected," Sam sighed as she melted into Brooke's embrace.</p>
