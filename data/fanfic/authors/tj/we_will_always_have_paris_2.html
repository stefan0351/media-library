<!-- We'll Always Have Paris \ Chapter 2 -->

<p>B'Elanna didn't know what to expect when she reported to sickbay to begin finalizing the procedures for removing Seven's cortical inhibitor.  She was aware that any kind of emotion at all seemed to almost incapacitate the young drone since the inhibitor began working as it was programmed to do.  She promised herself that regardless of how infuriating Seven's behaviour might be over the next few days that she would not react, she would simply reign in her temper and work the problem until it was solved.  This proved to be less difficult than she had anticipated, somehow being outside of engineering, not on her own turf as it were, seemed to make the interactions go more smoothly.  Seven seemed grateful for the help, and wasn't nearly as infuriating when she made suggestions; the fact that she made suggestions and not statements or demands was a pleasant surprise for B'Elanna.</p>

<p>Seven had been a little concerned at the thought of working so closely with B'Elanna, she feared that her fragile grip on her health would suffer with the continuous onslaught of Klingon emotions.  She found, however, that B'Elanna seemed very restrained, distant and professional. The young Klingon listened respectfully to what Seven had to say concerning the procedure for removing the inhibitor and the days progressed without argument. She seemed concerned for the drone's well being and Seven was appreciative of how much extra time that B'Elanna seemed to be willing to give to help her out.</p>

<p>Finally the day came for the procedure, several of the crewmembers came by to wish Seven well, including  the captain and Harry Kim.  Seven noticed that Commander Chakotay was noticeably absent from all the senior officers who came to offer their support. It bothered Seven enough that she approached B'Elanna for the first time to discuss something of a personal nature.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Torres."</p>

<p>"Yeah Seven, what is it," B'Elanna was busy arranging the instruments she would need for the procedure near the biobed.</p>

<p>"I was wondering if you told Commander Chakotay about my holoprogram?"</p>

<p>"What holoprogram?" B'Elanna seemed distracted.</p>

<p>"The one I was using to research romantic situations."</p>

<p>"Oh, uh, no I didn't, but to be honest I thought about it. You know there are rules about using actual people for holographic programs. It's a pretty big invasion of privacy."</p>

<p>"Then why did you not inform the commander about my indiscretion?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure.  I guess I know that you didn't really mean any harm.  I'd feel better about it if you told me you wouldn't use it again though."</p>

<p>"I have already deleted the program."</p>

<p>"Oh, well then I guess there's no problem."</p>

<p>B'Elanna continued to work at arranging the instruments, but something was bothering her now that the topic had come up.</p>

<p>"I don't get it, why use a hologram of someone you know.  I mean, you of all people know the rules, surely any hologram from the database would have been a sufficient practice dummy?"</p>

<p>"But I wished to find the most efficient way of interacting with the crew of Voyager.  I used the physical and psychological parameters set out in the database to simulate crewmembers and have realistic interactions with them.  This way I would find out who among the crew I am compatible with and who I should not bother to attempt to pursue a friendship with based on the outcome of the programs. In this manner I would not risk emotional damage should the outcome not be what I hoped."</p>

<p>"Seven, it just doesn't work that way, you can't protect yourself from life by using holo simulations.  Even if you have psychological information from the computer that doesn't mean that people in the real world will react the same way.  You can't just run an experiment and hope to determine who your friends should be," B'Elanna explained.</p>

<p>"It is of no further consequence.  My experiments were a failure. .  I was unable to establish a sufficient camaraderie with any member of the crew, and my romantic efforts were unsatisfactory as well. It seems I lack even the basic ability to tell a friend from someone who does not have my best wishes at heart."</p>

<p>B'Elanna heard the anguish in Seven's voice.  The young drone seemed so overwhelmed that she was actually leaning on the console for support.  The engineer couldn't stop herself from asking one more question however,  "Seven, can you tell me why you chose a hologram of Commander Chakotay for your romantic interactions?"</p>

<p>"I felt it would be safe.  While I have no real feelings for him, I find him to be rather pleasant and nonthreatening.  I thought it would help me learn more about romantic affiliations if the image I was interacting with was a familiar and pleasant stimulus. I thought that perhaps we were friends."  Seven paused, unsure if she could bear to reveal her true concerns about the Commander.    "I was surprised at his objections to the removal of the cortical inhibitor.  It seems that perhaps I was wrong about our relationship being a friendly one."</p>

<p>"I don't know Seven, he was just keeping what he felt were the best interests of the ship in mind.  I wouldn't take it too personally." B'Elanna could see that Seven was upset and tried to steer her away from the painful subject.</p>

<p>"But it is personal.  He would never have made such an objection if it were any other, fully human member of the crew.  He does not trust the Borg half of my personal makeup, but he is also unwilling to allow me to access the very thing that I require to become more fully human. Is that not personal?" Seven's voice cracked with emotion.</p>

<p>"To be honest I'm just not sure, but look Seven, you shouldn't be thinking about all of this now.  In a couple of days when you wake up you'll have access to all of your emotions, then you'll really be able to tell who is a friend and who isn't, but no more holograms okay, try interacting with the crew for a change, you might be surprised." It was the best B'Elanna could do in the way of being comforting, and Seven seemed to accept it as such.</p>


<p>Seven lay down on the biobed and as B'Elanna and the doctor hooked her up to the portable regenerator, she looked up at the engineer, "B'Elanna, thank you.  I appreciate all you have done for me."</p>

<p>"Thank me when you wake up."  Her voice was gruff, but not unkind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the weeks following the removal of the cortical inhibitor Seven experienced many difficulties in adjusting to life as an emotional being.  She found herself reliving moments from the past, hearing comments made by other crewmembers and understanding them now in a new light.  She was bombarded with the negative images of herself reflected in the crew's behaviour toward her.  She was often overwhelmed by the smallest of setbacks, and the captain had ordered her onto reduced duties until she was more able to handle her emotions.  Gradually she began to learn how to control her newborn feelings, to guard herself from everyday hurts and offences, both given and taken.  She found to her sadness that she had to limit her exposure to the chief engineer.  The volatile arguments she remembered from the past caused Seven untold distress as she struggled to comprehend the vivid emotions of the fiery Klingon.  One side effect of this distance was that Seven experienced loneliness, and the experience of 'missing' someone.</p>


<p>She found solace in the oddest of places.  She found it with the chief engineer's daughter.  She often found herself making her way to the messhall when she knew that Neelix would be looking after Kate.  She found the child's primal emotions to be somehow soothing.  Seven felt a kinship with the infant, as they both came to grips with a wider emotional world.  She would often carry her around the messhall, talking to the child in the same tone of voice she would use with an adult.  Seven never indulged in baby talk.  She liked to stand at the view port and explain things to Kate as they came into sight.  Neelix could only shake his head indulgently at Seven's attempts at bonding.  He did have to admit, however, that Kate was always quiet and attentive with Seven.  After several days of observing their interactions Neelix would sometimes call Seven to the messhall to calm Kate down if she was overwrought.  The young Klingon hybrid would cease crying almost as soon as Seven picked her up and began talking to her in calm even tones.</p>

<p>One such day Seven was standing at the viewport with Kate in her arms, explaining to the young child the attributes of a star cluster that had just passed by when the young drone heard B'Elanna's voice as she came into the messhall.  Seven was immediately besieged with emotions.  She felt guilt for touching the engineer's child after B'Elanna had been so upset with her last time.  She felt fear of reprisal, and regret that B'Elanna might explicitly forbid her to have contact with Kate ever again.  She turned to face B'Elanna, moving to hand over the child.</p>

<p>"B'Elanna, I am sorry to have interacted with your child without your permission.  I assure you I did not allow her to come into contact with my implants, she was in no danger," the distress was obvious in her voice as she attempted to give Kate to B'Elanna.</p>

<p>B'Elanna had been shocked to see her child in Seven's arms again.  The abject terror on Seven's face upon having been discovered calmed the flash of anger that threatened to erupt.  The engineer could see that her daughter was content and unharmed. The time she had spent in Seven's company as they worked out a way to defeat the emotion inhibitor had allowed her to get to know and trust the young drone; she knew instinctively that Seven would not allow harm to come to her child.</p>

<p>"It's okay Seven, she seems happy with you."  B'Elanna saw the relief flood over Seven's features at her soft words.  The next words out her mouth surprised even B'Elanna. "Do you want to keep her while I get my dinner Seven?"</p>

<p>"You would allow this?"  Seven couldn't believe that B'Elanna of all people would trust her to care for an infant.</p>

<p>"Sure if it's no bother.  I'd love a chance to eat my dinner while it's still hot for a change."</p>

<p>"I would be honoured to watch Kate while you eat Lieutenant Torres."</p>

<p>"Um, thanks."  B'Elanna walked to the food line and got her meal.  She watched Seven interacting with her child the entire time she was eating and she had to admit that Kate seemed completely content with the young drone.  She appeared to be actually listening to everything that Seven was saying.  B'Elanna didn't think she had ever heard Seven talk so much before in her life.</p>

<p>When she was done her meal she took Kate back from Seven, thanking the drone for her help.  Seven felt another flood of emotion, gratefulness, happiness, and sadness as the warmth of the child was taken from her arms, but she managed to control them, rather than being controlled by them.  She was pleased with her growing ability to keep things in perspective, and was hopeful she would be able to return to duty soon.</p>

<p>"So Seven when are we going to see you back in engineering?" B'Elanna asked the question more out of politeness than a desire to have the Borg meddling with her engines again, although she did have to admit that in an odd way she missed their fights.  She didn't seem to be able to vent with others the way she did with Seven.  She was also loath to admit that Seven brought an expertise to engineering that B'Elanna had missed over the past few weeks.</p>

<p>"I am unsure of when I will be able to deal with our interactions," Seven replied with brutal honesty.</p>

<p>B'Elanna felt immediately defensive.  "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"After having the emotion inhibitor removed I realized that I have often had my feelings hurt by you.  I am afraid that I would not be able to deal with this kind of interaction until I am better able to cope with my emotions."</p>

<p>"Seven, I'm sorry.  I know that we argue a lot, but I didn't really mean any of it personally."</p>

<p>"Meant or not I was often hurt by you, in particular your references to my Borg nature."</p>

<p>B'Elanna's honorable nature immediately caused her to regret her unwitting hurtful behaviour. "Kahless Seven, I am truly sorry.  Look, I promise if you come back to engineering I'll try to keep my Klingon temper under control.  If I hurt your feelings I hope that you'll tell me so we can work it out."</p>

<p>"I would like that Lieutenant.  I find it strange, but a part of me misses our arguments.  At least those of a more technical than personal nature," Seven finished with a slight smile, attempting to take some of the sting out of her previous comments.</p>

<p>B'Elanna was feeling terrible at the thought that her comments, made while she thought Seven was an emotionless drone, had come back to haunt Seven now.  "I meant what I said Seven, please try to come by engineering soon, and we'll see if we can't find a way to work together."</p>

<p>Seven nodded, once again feeling almost overwhelmed by the depth and variety of emotions she was feeling.  She watched as B'Elanna and Kate left the room.</p>


<p>It was two days later when Seven finally made an appearance in engineering.  She carried with her a small box wrapped in silver paper and tied with a bow.  She knocked politely at the door to B'Elanna's office and waited to be invited in before entering.  When B'Elanna finally told her to come in she entered slowly and set the gift on the desk in from of the engineer.</p>

<p>"It is a gift for Kate.  I am sorry that I did not attend the baby shower.  I hope you will forgive me."</p>

<p>"It's really not a problem Seven, you didn't have to get a gift."</p>

<p>"Open it."</p>

<p>B'Elanna opened the box and found a very bizarre pair of baby booties lying in the tissue paper.</p>

<p>"I fashioned them out of the same material as my biosuits.  Even if the temperature drops to &#150;25 centigrade, Kate's feet will be protected."</p>

<p>"Um, thanks Seven, they're certainly unique."</p>

<p>There was a moment of awkward silence before B'Elanna spoke up, "Well, I guess we should be getting back to work.  Maybe you could give me a hand realigning the plasma injectors on the warp coils."</p>

<p>"Of course Lieutenant."</p>

<p>They set to work, B'Elanna tried very hard to simply not speak to the young drone in an attempt to limit the possibilities for argument. She felt her old irritation flare up as several times she had to step around Seven to gain access to the injectors.  The young drone seemed to have a knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time around B'Elanna.</p>

<p>They ran several diagnostics and B'Elanna was making adjustments to the alignment of the primary injectors when Seven spoke up, "That is the incorrect algorithm Lieutenant, you are moving the injectors further out of phase."</p>

<p>B'Elanna felt her anger flare again, but clamped it down quickly before she spoke. "Look Seven, I know what I'm doing.  I can finish up here if you have other things to do."</p>

<p>"I have no other tasks that require my attention, and I am certain that your calculations are in error Lieutenant."  Seven began to summarily override the changes that B'Elanna was making to the injectors and B'Elanna couldn't keep her temper under control for another second.</p>

<p>"Look Borg, what the hell do you thing you're doing?" B'Elanna roared, pushing Seven away from the console.</p>

<p>"I am attempting to correct your error Lieutenant," Seven's voice cracked as she spoke and B'Elanna saw tears welling up in her eyes.</p>

<p>B'Elanna had to struggle to rein in her temper, and it was a moment before she trusted herself to speak.</p>

<p>"Seven, I'm sorry for yelling, and I'm sorry for calling you Borg, but you can't just do whatever you feel like and not expect people to react negatively."</p>

<p>"But Lieutenant, you are only making the problem with the injectors worse, I am attempting to help you."</p>

<p>"I understand that you see it that way, but I'm pretty sure I'm right, and even if I'm wrong, just making the changes like that is not the right way to go about telling me so."</p>

<p>Seven fought back her tears and took the data PADD from B'Elanna and attempted to show the engineer where the error in her logic was.  To Seven's horror as the two of them began to work through the formula it became clear that in fact B'Elanna had been correct.</p>

<p>"It appears that I am in error Lieutenant, I apologize for my behaviour. You were correct, I have no business working in engineering, I believe it would be best if I left." Seven turned to leave engineering, stopping only when she felt B'Elanna's hand on her arm.</p>

<p>"Seven, you can't just run away from stuff like this.  You are going to have to learn to live with your emotions, and you're going to have to learn to be a little more respectful of other people's feelings as well.  You made a mistake and you apologized, let's just forget it and get back to work.  You can start by reentering the calculations I made."</p>

<p>"Yes Lieutenant."</p>

<p>B'Elanna saw that Seven was still crying as she began to redo the work that she had undone, and she couldn't help but feel sorry for the younger woman.  She put her hand on Seven's shoulder, saying, "everyone makes mistakes Seven, you'll get through this."</p>


<p>That night B'Elanna was anxious to get off work on time.  Tom was picking up Kate and B'Elanna was heading to the holodeck to run an excerise program.  It was the first time since Kate was born that she was going to be able to really let off some steam.  She needed it even more tonight after dealing with Seven all afternoon.  She thought she was going to explode from having to hold back her irritation with the young drone.  Although she had to admit she had felt terrible watching Seven try to deal with all of her new emotions, she had been strangely affected by Seven's tears.</p>

<p>She had her gear packed and was ready to go and Tom still hadn't shown up.  She asked the computer to locate him; her heart fell when she found out that he was in the other holodeck.  When she hailed him over the Comm it was quickly evident that he had been there a while and had been drinking.  He had completely forgotten his promise to baby-sit.  B'Elanna was furious, as there was no way she was leaving Kate with the helmsman when he was drunk.  She resigned herself to spending another night alone with her daughter and no outlet for all of her excess energy.</p>

<p>She thought about the holodeck sitting empty, and decided not to let the time go to waste.  Perhaps Seven could use the time to work out some of her nervous energy now that she was dealing with the stress of emotions.  B'Elanna still felt guilty about yelling at Seven in engineering so she made her decision.</p>

<p>&lt;Torres to Seven of Nine&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Seven here&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;Seven, Tom didn't show up to take care of Kate so I have two hours of holodeck time I can't use and I thought maybe you might like them&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;I'm on my way, Seven out&gt;</p>

<p>'So much for thank you,' B'Elanna thought to herself as she picked up Kate and began to pace around her quarters with her daughter in her arms.</p>

<p>She was surprised when the door chime went a few minutes later, and even more surprised to find Seven of Nine standing on her doorstep.</p>

<p>"Seven, I thought you'd be in the holodeck by now."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to run a program at this time," said the young woman as she shifted from foot to foot, looking nervous.</p>

<p>"I don't get it.  If you don't want the time I'll give it to someone else.  You could have just told me that over the comm."</p>

<p>"You should utilize your time Lieutenant."</p>

<p>"I can't, I wanted to run some Klingon exercise programs and I can't take Kate with me to those.  I really should see if anyone else wants the holodeck."</p>

<p>"What I mean is that I would be happy to look after Kate while you run your program."</p>

<p>B'Elanna was completely taken aback by Seven's unexpected offer, "I don't know, I mean thanks Seven, but Kate's a real handful, I couldn't ask you to look after her," B'Elanna tried desperately to find a way to say no to Seven without hurting her feelings.</p>

<p>"I enjoy interacting with your daughter.  It will not be a problem for me to watch her while you train.  Samantha Wildman often allows Naomi to spend time with me."</p>

<p>"Naomi is a lot older Seven, an infant requires a lot more care,"</p>

<p>"You do not trust me." The look of sadness on Seven's face was pushing B'Elanna into making a decision she never thought she would make.  She was not a big fan of Seven but she knew the drone would not allow any harm to come to her daughter.</p>

<p>"Of course I trust you Seven, I just think you don't know what you're getting into."</p>

<p>"Please, allow me to do this for you Lieutenant, it is the least I can do to repay you for your help in removing the emotional inhibitor."</p>

<p>B'Elanna gave up, "alright, but hail me if there is a problem."  She grabbed her workout gear and left the room quickly before she changed her mind.</p>

<p>Two hours later when she exited the holodeck she was feeling much better.  She hadn't realized how much she needed to let out some of that aggression and get in a really good workout.  She smiled happily to herself as she headed back to her quarters.  She was surprised to see Seven of Nine stretched out on the floor of her living room.  Her hair was entirely disheveled, and she appeared to have a rather large stain on the front of her biosuit, but she was happily playing with Kate.  B'Elanna chuckled as she heard Seven explaining in adult tones about efficient construction methods as the two of them built a house out of large plastic blocks.</p>

<p>Seven looked up as B'Elanna entered the room.  "Lieutenant, you are damaged!"</p>

<p>B'Elanna was indeed sporting several rather large cuts and bruises on her face after her encounter with a rebel Kazon force in her holoprogram.  "It's no big deal Seven, I'm fine&#133;just a few bruises."</p>

<p>"You should go to sickbay and have them looked after."  The concern in Seven's voice was evident.  It surprised Seven almost as much as it did B'Elanna.  She had been shocked at the fear and concern that washed over her when she saw the damage to B'Elanna's face.</p>

<p>"If I go to sickbay I'll have to listen to the doctor's lecture on holodeck safety protocols.  Honestly, I'm fine."</p>

<p>At the worried look on Seven's face B'Elanna relented.  "If I show you something will you promise to keep my secret?"</p>

<p>"Of course Lieutenant."</p>

<p>B'Elanna went into her bathroom and came out carrying a dermal regenerator she had 'borrowed' from sickbay in her hand.  "See, I can take care of this myself."</p>

<p>"You are not attempting to damage yourself again as you were when you found out about the deaths of your Maquis friends are you Lieutenant Torres?" Seven's concern was evident, and she felt almost dizzy with the wave of emotions that rushed through her at the memory of that dark period in B'Elanna's life.</p>

<p>"No, of course not, I keep minimal safeties on at all times, but if there isn't a little element of danger it isn't as good of a workout."</p>

<p>Seven looked skeptical as B'Elanna tried to look in the mirror and manipulate the dermal regenerator over her face.</p>

<p>"Please, Lieutenant, allow me."  Seven took the dermal regenerator from B'Elanna's hand and led the young Klingon to the couch where she proceeded to carefully heal her wounds.</p>

<p>B'Elanna was surprised at how gentle Seven was being with her, and even more surprised to find that the metal of Seven's enhanced hand was soft and warm against the skin of her face.  She was suddenly very conscious of the fact that she was only inches away from Seven's face.</p>

<p>"There, all done," Seven was thankful that she had managed to keep her hands from shaking as she touched the young Chief's face.  She had felt an overwhelming sense of protectiveness and compassion for the young mother as she worked.</p>

<p>"Listen, you aren't going to tell anyone about this are you?" B'Elanna was worried that word of her exploits might make it back to Captain Janeway.</p>

<p>"I will not, but only if you promise to be careful."</p>

<p>"Deal&#133;.  Seven, what the heck is that all over your biosuit?"  B'Elanna couldn't hold back her curiosity any longer.</p>

<p>"Kate appears to have an aversion to apple juice."</p>

<p>B'Elanna couldn't stop herself from laughing, "Sorry Seven, I should have told you about that."</p>

<p>"I attempted to explain to her that apple juice is an excellent nutritional supplement for an infant, but she objected strenuously.  It would appear she has her mother's disposition, I am not certain from whom she inherited her aim, but I assure you it is accurate!"</p>

<p>B'Elanna snorted at Seven's Borg description of one of Kate's famous temper tantrums.</p>

<p>Seven found to her surprise that she was beginning to laugh herself.   She covered her mouth with her hand and tried to hold back the sound, but the harder she tried to fight it the less control she had, finally both she and B'Elanna laughed until they cried.</p>

<p>"I am leaking," Seven cried out horrified that something was going wrong with her again.</p>

<p>This caused B'Elanna to laugh even louder as she tried to explain to a hysterical drone the concept of tears of laughter.</p>

<p>It was several minutes until the two of them calmed down enough to speak.</p>

<p>"This was my first experience with real laughter, I find that I enjoyed the sensation."  Seven stated.</p>

<p>"I should hope so Seven, you have a great laugh." 'Where the hell did that come from Torres,' B'Elanna thought to herself as the unexpected words came out of her mouth.</p>

<p>"Explain."</p>

<p>"I don't know, its, musical or something&#133;. It's just a pleasant sound, that's all."  B'Elanna wiped the last of the tears from her eyes.  "God, I haven't laughed like that in ages."</p>

<p>"That is a shame Lieutenant, but why?"</p>

<p>"I guess I just haven't had anything to laugh about recently. It isn't easy having to raise Kate all by myself."</p>

<p>"I am sorry Lieutenant."</p>

<p>"Don't be, I should be happy, I have a great job and a healthy child, I just need to get my life back into some semblance of order."</p>

<p>"I believe that I understand what you mean.  Ever since the emotional inhibitor was removed I have been beset with a barrage of emotions.  I do not believe I will be able to function efficiently until I learn to control them.  My life is lacking in order as well."</p>

<p>B'Elanna was uncomfortable sharing this much personal stuff with the drone, and so she attempted to change the subject. "Well, I have to feed Kate and get her to bed.  Thanks for your help Seven.  I really appreciate it."</p>

<p>Seven felt her heart fall at her abrupt dismissal, but she attempted to cover it up by rising quickly and heading for the door.  She wasn't quick enough however, and B'Elanna saw the flash of pain cross her face.  She felt like a complete Targ, Seven had been kind enough to look after Kate and here she was treating her like a servant or something.</p>

<p>"Hang on Seven, do you want to help me feed Kate and maybe have dinner after?"  She couldn't believe she was actually volunteering to spend time with the drone, but she just felt she couldn't let her go away looking so sad.  Besides, it had been a long time she had simply hung out and laughed with someone other than Kate.</p>

<p>The look of gratitude and happiness on Seven's face made B'Elanna think that dinner with Seven wouldn't be so bad after all.</p>
