<!-- A Reluctant Solitude \ Part 4 -->

<p>The relationship between the two women seemed to settle down after their dinner together and they seemed to relax into a productive working relationship.  They fell into a pattern of sharing at least one meal per day together, but despite that fact they never again discussed their feelings or attempted to clarify the nature of their relationship-the dinners, as enjoyable as they were, took the form of a working dinner.  They discussed their jobs and dreamed up projects that they could work on together to improve the functioning of many of Voyager's systems.  They had achieved a measure of comfort in working together, but they only seemed able to socialize alone together when the evening was structured around work.  B'Elanna was uncomfortable with the fact that she had been so open about her feelings with the former drone.  She was unused to discussing emotions and uncomfortable with how vulnerable she felt now that she had admitted fearing rejection by Seven.  Seven for her part was not comfortable in keeping the truth about her feelings from B'Elanna and was afraid that if their conversation were to take a more personal turn she would be forced to lie to her new friend, and that was unacceptable to her.  But still, they both enjoyed the time they spent together, even if sometimes it felt a bit devoid of feeling.</p>

		<p>Their current collaboration involved a method of enriching the dilithium mixture ratio in order to increase the ability of the warp core to sustain higher warp speeds for longer periods of time.  The project involved extensive modifications to both the injectors and the warp core itself.  As usual both Seven and B'Elanna had very firm ideas as to how best to carry out the modifications, and after several hours of discussion they still had not come to an agreement as to how they should proceed.  Seven, in her usual manner, had decided that her method was the proper one and took it upon herself to begin modifications without further consultations with the Chief engineer.  She had been working steadily for over an hour when her concentration was interrupted by the arrival of an extremely agitated half-Klingon engineer.</p>

		<p>"Seven!  What the hell do you think you're doing?"  Seven was startled by the sound of B'Elanna's angry voice.  The flash of guilt she felt at having proceeded without B'Elanna's permission was extinguished when she bumped her head sharply on the railing surrounding the warp core and was replaced by anger.</p>

		<p>"I am attempting to carry out the modifications to the warp core in the most efficient manner possible."  B'Elanna was infuriated with the former drone for usurping her authority and going behind her back to work on the core.</p>

		<p>"We still haven't agreed on the best method of proceeding..."</p>

		<p>"No, WE have not because you are incapable of admitting that my way is superiour.  I am tired of waiting and so I have decided to simply proceed in the best interests of the ship." Seven interrupted.</p>

		<p>"Dammit Seven, you just can't come into my engine room and start tearing apart the core without my permission.  You are really starting to piss me off here."</p>

		<p>"Good!"</p>

		<p>"Good?"</p>

		<p>"Yes...I am happy that you are pissed off as that will give you some appreciation for how I am feeling in this moment."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was a little shocked to hear such language coming out of Seven's mouth, and the truth was she almost laughed out loud, but she was still too angry at what she saw as Seven's betrayal to relent.</p>

		<p>"You're mad at me?"</p>

		<p>"Yes!"</p>

		<p>"You can't be mad at me!"</p>

		<p>"Why not?"</p>

		<p>"Because...I was mad at you first!"  B'Elanna knew she was being childish, but she was still too angry to care.</p>

		<p>"I wasn't aware that we were taking turns," Seven couldn't stop a smirk from playing around the edges of her mouth.</p>

		<p>Now B'Elanna couldn't stop the smile that spread over her face.  She was fighting back laughter as she spoke.</p>

		<p>"How about I only get mad at you on days of the week with vowels in their names," B'Elanna joked.</p>

		<p>"And I will only get angry at you on Stardates that contain prime numbers."  They were both laughing now, and B'Elanna had to lean on the main console to keep herself upright.  There were tears running down her cheeks as she fought herself back under control.</p>

		<p>Her smile faded as she turned back to the warp core and caught sight of the half-dismantled machinery.</p>

		<p>"Seven, I really think that if we realign the magnetic constrictors the way I outlined in my plan we'll have a better conversion rate of anti-matter over the long run."</p>

		<p>Seven knew that B'Elanna's plan was at least as efficient as her own.  She was unwilling to risk another argument with her friend by disagreeing with her again, so she merely shrugged her shoulders as she spoke.</p>

		<p>"Perhaps you are right.  I believe we should proceed according to your plan."</p>

		<p>"Damn right we should," B'Elanna growled.  "My way is better.  Besides, don't ever forget that this is MY engine room."</p>

		<p>"You really are a child Lieutenant Torres," Seven muttered.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, but that's why you love me."  Seven froze at B'Elanna's words.  A blush crept over her cheeks-she was terrified that the Chief had found out about her true feelings.  It was only when she realized that B'Elanna was still teasing that she relaxed and began to undo some of her modifications.  They continued to tease back and forth while they worked, both of them happy to have weathered their first fight since forging a friendship.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The improvement of the warp core succeeded beyond their expectations and they managed to complete the project with a minimum of disagreement between them-a downright miracle according to several junior members of the engineering staff.  They continued to spend a large portion of their free time together, and B'Elanna found herself wondering why she no longer got so angry at Tom when he ran off to play with Harry in the holodeck, or canceled their plans together in order to spend time on his latest obsession.  One such evening she returned to her quarters after having spent the evening with Seven, deep in discussions about improving sensor accuracy; she suddenly realized that it had been over a week since she had spent any real time with Tom.  In the past it would have infuriated her to feel that she was being cast aside by the helmsman, but tonight she felt almost nothing, certainly not anger, when she thought of the amount of time they had spent apart.  It was troubling to her that she felt this way and despite the fact that something was nagging at the back of her mind about the nature and quality of their relationship she determined that she should be the one to do something about how little time they had spent together recently.  She resolved to seek Tom out for dinner the very next day.  After all they were in a relationship and honour demanded that she do her best to make it work.  She fell asleep firm in her resolve despite the niggling feeling that she was overlooking something important.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>The next day Seven of Nine was working in Astrometrics when Tom Paris, Chakotay and Neelix came to see her.  Voyager had found what amounted to an Interstellar junk dealer and they wished to use the ships' sensors to take a closer look at what was on offer.  She helped them scan the fields of scrap in order to make a list of things they wished to obtain from the rather seedy looking trader.  They were completing the scans when the helmsman let out a low whistle at a small shuttlecraft the sensors had picked up.</p>

		<p>"I think I'm in love," he said in a tone of reverential awe.</p>

		<p>Seven gave him a rather scathing look, which he missed-his entire attention being consumed by the small ship.</p>

		<p>"You are in a relationship with Lieutenant Torres...I should think you would KNOW what it is to be in love," she couldn't stop herself from saying.</p>

		<p>Paris ignored her remark completely, if he heard it at all. He was still scanning the ship and attempting to convince Chakotay that Voyager 'needed' to obtain it at any cost.  Seven found Chakotay to be unusually levelheaded for a human and so she was surprised at how quickly he gave in to Tom's enthusiasm for the ship.  She shook her head and felt a sense of sadness on behalf of her friend as she realized that B'Elanna was in for another period of time in which she would be forced to take a back seat to yet another in Tom Paris' seemingly endless line of pet projects and hobbies.  She felt a fleeting sense of happiness knowing that B'Elanna would be free to spend a great amount of uninterrupted time with her, but she forced herself to push that thought aside.  She truly loved B'Elanna, and, as such, she wanted to put her friend's happiness first above all else.  It was not easy, but Seven was used to that.</p>

		<p>She stood by and watched while B'Elanna tried to take an interest in the ship that Tom had named Alice, and she provided a sympathetic ear when the Klingon hybrid again and again was hurt by Tom's disregard for her feelings.  When the ship attempted to harm B'Elanna in an attempt to have Tom all to itself Seven was ready to do physical damage to the helmsman in her anger at him for putting B'Elanna in danger.  It was only her knowledge that B'Elanna would not be pleased if she did that stayed her hand against the childish flight controller.  When Alice and Tom left Voyager Seven was inclined to let them go, but once again her feelings for B'Elanna dictated her actions and she did everything she could to track the ship and bring the wayward pilot back into Voyager's fold.</p>

		<p>After the incident with Alice, Tom seemed to mend his ways.  He was much more attentive to B'Elanna, and attempted to spend a great deal more time with her.  This left Seven very much on her own, and it bothered her.  She missed her interactions with the Chief Engineer, and longed to spend more time with her, but at the same time she berated herself for her selfishness, B'Elanna appeared to be happy and Seven was determined to support her, no matter the personal cost.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was indeed happy that Tom was spending more time with her...at first.  But after an endless round of dates in Sandrine's, and games on the holodeck she began to feel that something was missing.  Exactly what it was eluded her for a few days...but after another evening spent listening to Tom talk about his latest holodeck program she realized that what she was missing was the companionship and intellectual stimulation that she had derived from her time spent with Seven.  Hard as it was for her to believe or to admit even to herself, she missed the former drone.  When Tom asked her to join him the next night for a romantic dinner in St Moritz she declined, saying that she had something she needed to take care of instead.  Tom was a bit hurt that she didn't appear to be appreciating his attempts to spend more time with her and he questioned her mercilessly until she finally told him the truth.  That she wanted to spend some time with Seven.</p>

		<p>"You're kidding me right?" Tom was incredulous. "You're dumping me for the drone!"</p>

		<p>"I'm not dumping you, and I've asked you repeatedly to not call her that.  She's my friend."</p>

		<p>"Right, and my new best friend is an isolinear spanner!"</p>

		<p>"You're on real thin ice right now flyboy...just drop it."  B'Elanna growled.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry for insulting Seven, but you're always going on about how little time we spend together and now here you are running off to spend time with someone else."</p>

		<p>"I know.  Look Tom...spending time with you has been great." A small nagging part of B'Elanna's brain told her that this was not exactly true, but she quashed the thought quickly.  "It's just that Seven was there for me all the time when you were too busy for me, and I'm feeling sort of guilty for just dumping her now that you're taking an interest again.  I used to hate women like that when I was growing up.  They want to be your best friend until a guy comes along and then it's 'see ya later.'  I don't want to be one of those women."</p>

		<p>"Alright already," Tom's hands were in the air indicating surrender.  "Have fun with Seven.  Don't mind me, I'll find something to occupy my time."</p>

		<p>"I have no doubt," B'Elanna replied, standing on her toes to kiss the pilot on his cheek.  </p>

		<p>Tom tried to turn the kiss into something more, and B'Elanna couldn't stop herself from pulling away.  This had been happening with alarming frequency lately, but again B'Elanna refused to examine that aspect of her behaviour.   She ignored the flash of annoyance that crossed Tom's face and made a hasty exit in search of her friend.</p>

		<p>She found Seven hard at work in Astrometrics.  The former drone looked up when she entered the room and B'Elanna felt her heart contract at the sight of the beaming smile that graced Seven's features when she caught sight of the engineer entering the room.  Tom never looked at her like that.</p>

		<p>"Lieutenant Torres...What can I do for you."</p>

		<p>"You can agree to have dinner with me tomorrow night," B'Elanna replied with a shy grin.</p>

		<p>"Has Mr. Paris found a new project then?" Seven asked.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna felt a stab of guilt at Seven's innocent question.  She never intended to make the former Borg feel as though she were second best, and yet obviously she had.</p>

		<p>"No, actually he wanted to have dinner tomorrow as well, but I told him I wanted to spend the evening with you instead."</p>

		<p>Seven's smile grew wider at hearing B'Elanna's words.</p>

		<p>"Are you certain you wouldn't rather spend your time with him?"</p>

		<p>"Absolutely.  The truth is I've missed our time together.  It just hasn't been the same without you.... So, what do you say...is it a date?"</p>

		<p>Seven felt her face suffuse with colour at B'Elanna's terminology, and she quickly struggled to put her customary impassive look back in place before the engineer noticed.</p>

		<p>"Indeed...it is a... date," she replied, unable to keep the happiness she felt from coming through in her voice.</p>
