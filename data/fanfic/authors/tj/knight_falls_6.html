<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 6 -->

<p>Once the horses were unloaded Harry and B'Elanna rode into town to find a place to stay for the evening.  B'Elanna was hoping against hope that somehow they would be at the same inn as the Hansart family, but she was disappointed to see no sign of the girl or her family once they had obtained their room.  They took their meal in the dining room that night and found that the entire town was abuzz with talk of the series of bold robberies committed by highwaymen on the road to Canterbury, which was the next major town on the road to London.  There were numerous tales of the exploits of the band of thieves who were known to be violent offenders and rumoured to be of Moorish background. Apparently Fayed Al-Tuvoch a former Muslim caliph who had been defeated by his enemies and sold into slavery in England had escaped from his master and was now controlling a band of cutthroats in the King's Forest and they were attacking passersby at will.  The authorities had been unable to find out where he was staying and were at a loss to predict where he might strike next.  All travelers on the roads in the area were being urged to hire armed guards to ensure their safe passage over the treacherous road.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was not concerned for their own well being as she was confident in their ability to defend themselves.  She was however concerned for Annika and her family and so she sent Harry out in search of them to see if he could find out when they were leaving Dover and if they had hired a retinue of guards to accompany them on the road to Canterbury.  Harry returned late in the night; it had taken him many hours and several small bribes before he could locate the family.  He came into their room shaking the rain off of his hair and hurrying to sit by the fire to warm his hands.</p>
<p>"Well, did you find them?"</p>
<p>"Yes, eventually."</p>
<p>"And?"</p>
<p>"I spoke to a man named Thomas who is a squire of the house of Hansart.  He told me that they were leaving tomorrow and further that they had hired several men to accompany them on the road.  So now that you know all of this are you going to tell me why is it is of such importance?"</p>
<p>"No reason really.  I met the daughter of the house and was merely concerned that her family be protected that's all."</p>
<p>"This wouldn't be the blonde beauty from the banquet at Rouen would it?" Harry teased, fairly certain that his shot had hit home.</p>
<p>"I suppose she was rather beautiful," B'Elanna replied in a failed attempt at nonchalance.</p>
<p>"Well, then it may interest you to know that are departing shortly after dawn."  Harry paused for a moment and then continued with a smile, "I took the liberty of informing the stables that we would require our horses to be ready for departure at dawn."</p>
<p>B'Elanna fell back on the bed with a groan.  "You know me too well my friend."</p>
<p>"And I love you too well not to warn you that this can only end badly for you B'Elanna. You are in disguise and there is no future in this pursuit.  She may well fall in love with Lord Beyla, but you can't forget that you will always be B'Elanna Torrance."</p>
<p>B'Elanna didn't answer and Harry wisely decided that he had said enough.  He left the room and made arrangements to have their morning meal ready before dawn.  When he returned to their room B'Elanna was in bed with her back to him.  He went to bed and lay worrying about the fate of his friend's heart for several hours before he finally managed to sleep.</p>
<p>The next morning there were several delays before they finally set out on the road to Canterbury and by the time they reached the outskirts of town they could only see the retinue of the Hansart family in the distance.  Harry was relieved to see that B'Elanna was making no effort to catch up with them and seemed content to trail along at this distance.  Periodically they would lose sight of the group ahead as they passed through forested patches or turned a corner that shielded them from view.  Judging by the size of the group, however, B'Elanna assumed that they were well protected and was content to ride along behind with only Harry for company.  They had taken great care in hiding their wealth cunningly throughout their equipment.  Some of the gold pieces were sewn into the hems of their cloaks, or hidden in secret pockets in the saddle blankets of their horses.  They had been sure to leave a box with a sufficient number of coins in it poorly hidden in a saddlebag as a decoy.  If they were set upon they would allow the thieves to make off with a small amount of money and save themselves a fight.</p>
<p>They had been riding through a small wooded area talking together about where they should go to purchase the necessary equipment for jousting.  B'Elanna would require a different set of armour, lances of course, as well as a quintain with which to practice.  They were just discussing the fact that they would need to buy a larger horse for the endeavour when they emerged from the woods and noticed that the caravan in the distance appeared to be under attack.  Without hesitation they both dug their heels into the flanks of their horses and galloped toward the skirmish.</p>
<p>Harry was responsible for leading the spare horse and as such he could not keep up with B'Elanna as she surged ahead unimpeded. One of the ruffians had wrenched open the door of the litter and was halfway inside, grabbing at the jewelry that the women were wearing and B'Elanna heard the screams of terror as she rode alongside the carriage.  She thrust her sword into the side of the robber and he fell away from the carriage.  She bent over to look inside, and ascertaining that the women were in no further danger, she kicked the door shut with her foot and turned to give aid to the Hansart's men as they fought off the villains.</p>
<p>Harry had ridden up by this time and was engaging with one of the ruffians; B'Elanna saw that he was in no danger and turned back to the battle.  She saw Annika's father grappling with a tall thin man with coal dark skin; they were fighting over a strong box that B'Elanna could only assume contained the family's money.  The man struck a blow to Lord Hansart's face and knocked him full length onto the ground.  He then thrust the box into a sack and leapt onto his horse, fleeing toward the distant woods.  B'Elanna pursued him instantly, allowing her horse to take the bit into his teeth and charge ahead recklessly.</p>
<p>When she drew along side the fleeing thief she gripped her sword fiercely and launched herself at the other man, bearing them both to the ground.  B'Elanna rolled up to her feet, grateful that she had not lost her sword in the fall.  The other man was just as quick and he drew his sword, coming to the attack immediately.  He set upon B'Elanna with a fury and it was all she could do to ward off his blows.  After several minutes on the defensive B'Elanna's anger reached its peak and she moved forward on the attack.  They fought furiously, trading blows at lightening speed.  B'Elanna felt a sudden sharp pain as the thief penetrated her defenses and his sword sliced cleanly through her left bicep.  She attacked with renewed vigour forcing him backward with several crushing overhead blows, before quickly changing her tactics and thrusting her sword deeply into his midsection before he could bring his sword down to parry the blow.  She pulled her sword back out, remaining on guard until she was certain he was dead.  At that point she remounted her horse and taking the reins of the thief's mount rode back to the caravan.</p>
<p>The fight was still raging around the caravan when B'Elanna rode back up and she leapt from her charging horse without bothering to slow down.  She quickly engaged two of the thieves, slashing one through the belly before spinning her sword to face rearwards, thrusting it viciously with both hands to dispatch a third man she heard approaching from behind.  She spun quickly to ward off a blow from her last attacker before cutting his sword from his hand with a quick chop.  She strode quickly to the caravan and pulled yet another of the ruffians from the door where he was attempting to gain entry, knocking him senseless before helping Harry fight off the last of the rouges.</p>
<p>In the end several of the men surrendered when they realized that their leader was dead and they were hopelessly outclassed by B'Elanna's swordsmanship.  She instructed Harry and Thomas, the Hansart's squire, to round up the living, disarm them and tie them up securely, and she sent two of the Hansart's men back to Dover for the authorities.</p>
<p>B'Elanna left Harry and Thomas to deal with the thieves and went to the carriage, opening the door and peering inside.  The three women were huddled together in the corner, the lady in waiting was crying and being comforted by Annika.</p>
<p>"It is over my ladies, I assure you that you are safe now."</p>
<p>She offered her hand to the elder Lady Hansart and urged her to see to her husband.  She helped Katherine out of the coach and turned to offer assistance to Annika as she moved to exit the confines of the carriage.  Annika stumbled as she stepped out into the blinding sun and it was only B'Elanna's quick reflexes that stopped her from falling completely.  B'Elanna was shocked to say the least to find herself holding Annika tightly in her arms half in and half out of the carriage.  In the end she solved the problem by sweeping the young lady into her arms and setting her feet gently on the ground.</p>
<p>"Lord Beyla you are injured." Annika's voice broke as she saw the extent of the damage to B'Elanna's arm.</p>
<p>B'Elanna had forgotten her injury in the heat of the battle but the wound was a deep one and had bled severely and the torn sleeve of her tunic was slick with blood.  Annika took B'Elanna's arm, leading her to sit on a nearby rock while she fetched water and some soft cloth with which to see to the warrior's wounds. With gentle hands she cleaned the dirt and blood away from the deep cut and bandaged the wound tightly.  As she worked she told B'Elanna of how the attack had come from nowhere and that the men they had hired to protect them from Fayed Al-Tuvoch had turned out to be the highwayman's own henchman. B'Elanna's blood ran cold at the thought of what might have happened had she and Harry not been following the Hansarts this morning.</p>
<p>Lord Hansart had recovered from the blow to his head and he approached now; he was a thin cultured looking man, he was balding and what hair he had left was dark.  He looked as if he had aged many years in the past few minutes.</p>
<p>"Lord Beyla, it appears that I and my family owe you our lives.  We are forever in you debt."</p>
<p>"I am honoured to have been able to serve you my Lord," B'Elanna replied bowing slightly to the older man.</p>
<p>"You will need a surgeon to see to that arm, and I believe that will be in need of his services as well."  Indeed the blood was already soaking through the bandages on B'Elanna's arm and Lord Hansart had a nasty gash quite close to his left eye.  In the end the two Lords agreed that it would be best if they were all to return to Dover for a few days until they were able to travel again.</p>
<p>Once it seemed that everyone was going to be fine Lord Hansart's wife finally broke into tears of relief.</p>
<p>"I will never feel safe in this country.  We should return to France immediately, I cannot face the journey to London in this savage land."</p>
<p>B'Elanna seeing that the woman was merely suffering from nerves approached and took her hand, kissing it gently.</p>
<p>"I assure you Lady Hansart that no further harm will come to you or your family.  I am placing you under my personal protection.  I will escort your family safely to London, you may depend on it."</p>
<p>Hearing the calm tones of the handsome young Lord the elder woman calmed down somewhat and smiled through her tears.</p>
<p>"Thank you my Lord.  I will fear no ill while you watch over us."</p>
<p>B'Elanna gave her arm to the woman and helped her back into the carriage as they prepared to return to Dover.  She in turn offered her hand to Annika and the young lady took it, and looking deeply into Lord Beyla's liquid brown eyes said, "I too will feel much better knowing that you will be near."  She placed a gentle kiss on B'Elanna's cheek.  "Thank you my Lord," she whispered before climbing into the darkened interior of the carriage.</p>
<p>As the caravan moved out toward Dover B'Elanna rode up beside Harry.</p>
<p>"I'm proud of you Harry, you handled yourself admirably."</p>
<p>"I've learned much about swordplay in the past few months," he replied.</p>
<p>"A battle like this is about much more than swordplay.  You faced your fears and conquered them.  You did well."</p>
<p>Harry almost blushed at B'Elanna's compliments.  In truth he had been terrified as he followed her into the fray, but his loyalty to her was paramount and he had pushed his fears aside and forced himself to fight.  If the truth were told her was quite proud of himself as well, it had been thrilling to stand side by side with the Hansart's squire Thomas as they fought off the superiour numbers of Al-Tuvoch's men.  He was no longer the frightened young man he had been the night the mob attacked his home, and he didn't miss that boy any longer.  He was surprised to find that he no longer missed his leisurely lifestyle either.  He had grown accustomed to sleeping in the woods and hunting for their food.  He loved assisting B'Elanna in her quest for glory and riches in the tournaments.  It was now that he realized that if some divine force were to offer to turn him back into Lord Kim he would decline the offer.  He much preferred his life as Harry Kim, faithful squire and companion to the dashing Lord Beyla.  He squared his shoulders and searched the horizon for any side of trouble as he rode along, happy to be helping protect the Hansarts with his Lord.</p>
<p>They arrived back in Dover just before the midday meal and this time they all engaged rooms at the same inn.  Thomas was dispatched to find a surgeon and soon the elderly man arrived to see to the wounds of B'Elanna and Lord Hansart.  B'Elanna had Harry cut the arm off of her tunic so the surgeon could work without the removal of her shirt being necessitated.  The doctor gave B'Elanna a leather bound stick to hold between her teeth as he poured alcohol over the wound and proceeded to sew it shut.  The procedure took nearly a half hour and B'Elanna was soaked in sweat when he finished bandaging her arm, but she had born her pain well and Lord Hansart was impressed with her courage and fortitude.  After the surgeon was finished with both of them they retired to their rooms and B'Elanna took a hot bath to wash the last of the blood and sweat from her skin.  Harry had already been to the tailor and had purchased a tunic and shirt to replace those lost in the battle, so B'Elanna had crisp new clothes to change into after her bath.</p>
<p>Lord and Lady Hansart took their evening meal in their rooms, but Annika and their retainers ate in the common room with Beyla and Harry.  Lord Hansart was comfortable allowing Annika to be in public knowing that Lord Beyla was watching over her.  He trusted the young knight implicitly after today and knew that his daughter would be safe as long as she was with the young Lord.</p>
<p>After the meal was over B'Elanna asked if Annika would care to take a walk around the town with her and was gratified that the young Lady seemed eager to comply.  B'Elanna strapped on a sword and offered Annika her arm as they left the inn and strolled toward the harbour.  When they first began walking B'Elanna felt tongue tied and could think of nothing to say, she merely walked and enjoyed the feeling of Annika's hand resting on her good arm.  It was a beautiful evening and when they reached the harbour they stopped to enjoy the sight of the moon shining over the water.  B'Elanna began to feel more confident and asked Annika questions about her life in France and soon they were chatting amiably.</p>
<p>Annika had never had an experience like this before.  Never had a man listened so intently to her words, nor for that matter had any man of her acquaintance really cared to know so much about her past and her feelings.  She felt herself drawn to Lord Beyla, in part because of his bravery and his looks, but more and more because when she was with him she felt known and seen in a way she never had before.  Most men thought of woman in the same terms as they thought of art or furniture, something that was to be admired for its beauty, something you owned, and bragged of owning, but something that was put aside at will when real life or something else more important beckoned.  Lord Beyla appeared to hang on her every word, and Annika felt appreciated for something other than her beauty for the first time in her life.</p>
<p>"You truly are like no man I've ever met before Lord Beyla," she finally ventured.</p>
<p>B'Elanna grinned at the truth of those words before asking, "what makes you say such a thing?"</p>
<p>"You truly listen to every word I say."</p>
<p>"This is an uncommon experience for you?" B'Elanna couldn't imagine not wanting to hear everything this enchanting woman had to say.</p>
<p>"It is for most women I understand.  I believe that my father truly loves my mother, but I don't imagine that he has heard a word she's uttered in their 30 years of marriage."</p>
<p>"Then that is a true tragedy.  How else am I to know and understand you if I don't listen to your words?"</p>
<p>"You wish to understand me?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do, I wish to know what makes you happy and what makes you sad, what you hope to achieve in life, what your dreams are.  I wish to know everything about you Lady Annika."</p>
<p>These words thrilled Annika to the core.  She wasn't sure she even knew the answers to some of those questions, and until this moment she hadn't known she had the right to even ask them of herself, but somehow she felt that when she was with Lord Beyla she would find the answers to them.  She tightened her grip on the young Lord's arm, and it was assurance enough for B'Elanna.  They began to walk slowly back to the inn, but they were both reluctant to return to the company of others.  They passed a tavern as they walked and they could hear music playing from inside.  B'Elanna knew it would not be appropriate to take Annika inside, but they stopped to listen, both of them enjoying the sweet sounds of the lyre.  Annika leaned into the lithe strong body of the young lord and slowly B'Elanna placed her arm around the younger woman's waist.  She knew she was pushing the bounds of propriety and desperately hoped that she was not misreading Annika's intentions; she was gratified when she felt the beautiful young woman rest her head upon her shoulder.  They stood there for some time, enjoying the closeness and listening to the soft music before B'Elanna realized it was time to return Annika to her family before they became worried about her prolonged absence.  When they returned to the inn B'Elanna walked Annika to the door of her room and bowed low over her hand as she kissed it, thanking the young beauty for her company this evening.  She was gratified to again receive a sweet and lingering kiss on her cheek in reply.</p>
