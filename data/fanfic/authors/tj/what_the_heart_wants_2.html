<!-- What the Heart Wants \ Chapter 2 -->

<p>As they settled down to work, Seven noticed that she was somewhat less than comfortable around Lt. Torres.  She dropped several of the tools that B'Elanna handed her and found that her heartrate was increased and she was beginning to perspire.  She put it down to guilt, to the fact that she felt honour-bound to tell the whole truth to B'Elanna regarding her own jealousies.  Perhaps once she broached the subject and apologized she would feel more normal.  She found as they began working however she was much calmer.  She liked the feeling of working in sync with the young engineer&#133;they were able to anticipate one another's needs and the work was going exceptionally smoothly.  It worried Seven however that B'Elanna had not once made eye contact and seemed to be doing her best to avoid physical contact, however fleeting, with Seven.</p>
<p>Finally, unable to put her task off any longer Seven cleared her throat,  "Um, Lt. Torres, there is something I feel I must tell you.  In fact I fear I owe you an apology after my behaviour in your quarters last night."</p>
<p>"Kahless Seven you don't owe me anything.  I messed up and you were right to be angry" B'Elanna interrupted.</p>
<p>"No, you don't understand," insisted Seven.  "I let my hurt regarding your actions drive me to behave irrationally. I believe I was so ashamed of my own jealousy of you and your abilities that I let it overshadow your apology. I reacted out of shame and not anger."</p>
<p>"What do you mean your jealousy of me?"</p>
<p>"Lt. Torres, you are a superior engineer in every way.  You make leaps of faith and logic that would never occur to me.  Your emotions fascinate me and I fear that our arguments are as much a result of that fascination as they are with our disagreements."</p>
<p>"Oh come on Seven you're a great engineer."</p>
<p>"You do not understand Lieutenant.  My abilities are derived from countless assimilations.  All the knowledge I possess came from other cultures and individuals whose enslavement was enacted to serve the collective.  My knowledge is a result of the untold suffering of millions.  I did nothing to earn it, and I do nothing to deserve it.  You, on the other hand, worked hard and studied harder for your knowledge.  Everything you know and everything you achieve is organic to you personally.  I could never hope to achieve such a measure of success." </p>
<p>Once again B'Elanna saw that the person she regarded as an emotionless drone was on the verge of crying. Her cerulean eyes were filled with tears that threatened to fall.</p>
<p>"Seven, I had no idea you felt that way!  But you're only partly right.  Sure, you did gain much of your knowledge through the collective, but you've grown beyond that.  You're an individual now and I see you learn everyday.  Don't ever let yourself believe that somehow your achievements are less because of the knowledge you gained from the Borg.   Argg&#133;look, I'm no good at this kind of thing, but trust me, I wouldn't be saying any of this if it weren't true.  You are a brilliant person, an individual, and that has nothing to do with your Borg background."</p>
<p>They sat in silence for a moment after B'Elanna's passionate outburst.  And then&#133;"Wait a minute&#133;. What do you mean your fascination with my emotions is why we argued so much," demanded B'Elanna.</p>
<p>Seven had hoped she wouldn't have to explain that one. Unable to look B'Elanna in the eye she began, "I have no emotions of my own&#133;. I do not understand them and I am afraid that I allowed our arguments to escalate so often because a part of me felt at least I was participating in an emotional experience vicariously through you," Seven replied softly.</p>
<p>"Of course you have emotions Seven&#133;I've just seen them right here in this Jefferies tube and last night in my quarters.  I can't believe how hard you're being on yourself."</p>
<p>"Then, you are not angry with me," Seven pleaded softly.</p>
<p>"Hey, I didn't say that," B'Elanna growled, but softened her words with a gentle smile as she saw the fear return to Seven's eyes.</p>
<p>"Why don't we just both agree that we could have behaved a lot better around one another and try a fresh start.  How about it Seven&#133;are you game?"</p>
<p>Seven had trouble speaking over the inexplicable lump she felt in her throat, so she settled for nodding vehemently in agreement with B'Elanna's suggestion.</p>
<p>Feeling that they had both taken about as much emotion as they could stand for now, B'Elanna turned back to the task at hand.  Seven was grateful for the reprieve and happier still that B'Elanna now seemed to accept her presence physically as well.  She no longer seemed to be shrinking into the furthest corner of the tube and allowed their hands and shoulders to brush softly several times as they worked in amicable silence.</p>
<p>They finally crawled out of the tube several hours later, both of them feeling stiff and dirty from the cramped and dingy spaces.  They sorted the various tools back into the tool locker and were about to part company for the evening when Seven got up the nerve to ask the question she had been thinking about for the past hour or so.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Torres, do you think.  I mean&#133; would you like to consume, or rather, I mean perhaps you would like to have dinner with me this evening," Seven stammered.</p>
<p>"Well, sure Seven, I was about to head to the messhall anyway."</p>
<p>"The messhall, right&#133; oh, it is just, I thought&#133;never mind, the messhall will be adequate." </p>
<p>"Sorry Seven you mean you want to have dinner in your quarters?"</p>
<p>Now Seven was blushing furiously&#133;actually blushing!  B'Elanna wouldn't have believed it had she not witnessed it for herself.</p>
<p>"I do not actually have quarters&#133;." The young drone let her voice trail off.</p>
<p>"Oh, I get it," B'Elanna growled, "you are inviting me to have dinner in MY quarters."</p>
<p>"I am sorry Lieutenant, please forget what I said; I believe the messhall is a preferable location.  I did not mean to&#133;I only wished to get to know you better, and I thought&#133;"</p>
<p>"Seven," B'Elanna finally took pity on the younger woman and interrupted, "its OK.  Why not&#133;let's have dinner at my place.  Give me an hour to have a shower and change and then drop by alright."  </p>
<p>Exactly one hour later, to the second B'Elanna would have wagered, the chime to her quarters rang.</p>
<p>"C'mon in Seven."</p>
<p>If anything the young Astrometrics officer looked even more uneasy than she had when she asked B'Elanna to have dinner, so B'Elanna hurriedly gave her the task of setting the table and helping to replicate a simple meal for the two of them to share. Fortunately her tactic worked, and before long the amicable feeling returned between them.</p>
<p>"You look very different when you are not in your uniform," Seven, who was as ever wearing a biosuit, finally ventured.  </p>
<p>"Um, thanks."  B'Elanna looked down at her attire.  </p>
<p>She was wearing black pants resembling her uniform pants only slightly tighter, and a black T-shirt that hugged the contours of her body and accentuated her musculature.  Seven thought she looked wonderful and found herself fascinated by the play of the Klingon's muscles rippling as she moved about the room and carried dishes to the table.  Once again she felt a rush of heat in the pit of her stomach and wondered if she should report to sick bay for a checkup.</p>
<p>Dinner was a success as they talked into the night about details of their jobs.  They even began talking about the formulas B'Elanna was working on for the dilithium mixture. B'Elanna was surprised to find herself having such a good time.  She had been secretly dreading spending social time with the former drone, but quickly reevaluated her position as the evening wore on.  Seven was intelligent and interesting, and was as excited about B'Elanna's projects as the engineer herself.  This was something B'Elanna had never shared with anyone.  Tom was only ever interested in sex and his holoprograms and not necessarily in that order.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Torres, you are looking sad.  Is something the matter."  B'Elanna hadn't realized she had fallen silent until Seven spoke.</p>
<p>"Not really&#133;I guess I was just thinking about Tom, and&#133;you know&#133;" her voice trailed off.  "You know I think you should really start calling me B'Elanna, now that we're&#133;well&#133;friends."  </p>
<p>The hopeful note in the young engineer's voice as she spoke of friendship caused Seven's heart to manifest a minor malfunction.  Seven was certain she had felt the muscle constrict and stop beating for a moment upon hearing B'Elanna's shy request.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna," Seven breathed softly.</p>
<p>"What is it you were thinking about Lieutenant Paris B'Elanna," Seven queried?</p>
<p>"I guess I was thinking about how he never was interested in my work; he was more interested in playing on the holodeck than actually talking to me.  I'm mad at myself for wasting so much time and energy on him, and madder still that there is a small part of me that will miss the social world he let me have access to for a while."</p>
<p>"You are referring to your belief that your friendships were a result of your relationship with LT. Paris," Seven stated.</p>
<p>B'Elanna nodded silently.</p>
<p>"I believe that your hypothesis is flawed on this subject.  While it is true that Lt. Paris has many acquaintances on Voyager, I believe that the crew values you and your presence on this ship far more than you appreciate.  If you would allow them to, I believe most of the crew would be happy to be considered your friend, just as I do." Seven paused and then continued gently,  "easy going and mildly amusing only go so far&#133;honour and intelligence wear much better in the long run."</p>
<p>"Wow thanks Seven."  B'Elanna was truly moved by the young Borg's words.  She didn't really believe them, but it felt wonderful to hear them spoken just the same.</p>
<p>They chatted happily as they finished dinner and cleared the dishes away to the recycler, neither of them willing to acknowledge the late hour.  It was Seven, who, noticing B'Elanna stifling a yawn, finally said, "I believe it is time for you to regenerate B'Elanna."</p>
<p>"Sleep Seven, and I suppose you're right.  Look, I had a nice time tonight&#133;I'm glad we finally got to know each other."  B'Elanna was feeling awkward&#133;unsure of what to do next.  She felt like hugging her new friend but as she stepped forward the look of panic she saw in Seven's eyes stopped her cold.</p>
<p>For her part, Seven had seen the young engineer step forward and open her arms slightly.  She was shocked at the physical reaction her body produced at the thought of B'Elanna's strong arms wrapped around her.  Once again her stomach felt as though it was constricting and the young Borg found herself unable to breathe; she worried again that she was becoming ill.  Seeing a look of displeasure cross B'Elanna's face, Seven assumed the young Klingon had changed her mind about wanting physical contact. Unsure of what to make of the situation, Seven fell back on Borg efficiency.  "Thank you Lieutenant Torres for a pleasant evening," she intoned in an emotionless voice.  She turned on her heel and left B'Elanna's quarters without even waiting for a reply.</p>
<p>Seven walked out into the corridor and after she heard the door to B'Elanna's quarters hiss shut she stopped and leaned against the bulkhead for support.  She thought her legs were going to give out.  Her heart ached as her eidetic memory replayed the image of displeasure on B'Elanna's face as she changed her mind about wanting to touch her.  Seven's lack of experience with emotions and with people was too limited for her to have any other context in which to understand B'Elanna's perceived actions.  All she could think of was that B'Elanna was unable to accept her Borg nature&#133;that she was too repulsed by what Seven was to want to touch her.  This thought was too much for Seven and she fought back tears as she made her way to Cargo Bay 2 for her regeneration.  She had so hoped that B'Elanna would accept her, and now those hopes seemed irretrievably dashed.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was confused and a little angry as she found herself looking at the cold metal of her door.  'What the hell was that all about,' she wondered to herself.  'I guess I'm good enough to talk to but not good enough to touch&#133;not even for the Borg&#133;' she thought bitterly as she went to her bedroom to change for bed.  She tossed and turned for quite some time as she replayed the moment over and over in her head.             She didn't know whether she was angrier with Seven for rejecting her or herself for caring so much that she hadn't been able to embrace the younger woman.  'Klingon's don't hug, get over it already Torres,' she                  muttered darkly. Finally she drifted into a sleep filled with dark dreams of rejection and pain.</p>
<p>The next day B'Elanna was irritable and sleepy.  She was short with Vorik when he approached her for clarification on a diagnostic he was running, and snapped at several of the junior crewmen.  By noon everyone in engineering knew to steer clear of the Chief.  B'Elanna buried herself in her work, missing lunch and asking Carey to bring her something from the messhall so she could eat at her desk.  She had hoped that Seven would come by engineering for something during the shift so she could have a chance to talk to her and perhaps figure out what went wrong last night.  Two hours after her shift ended B'Elanna finally gave up and returned to her quarters.  She was about to order a drink and go over some of the dilithium formulas, but she realized she wasn't in the mood to bury herself in her work.</p>
<p>"Screw this," she said out loud and headed to holodeck 2, where she knew the Sandrine's program would be running at this hour.  "Why should I hide in my quarters, I have as much right to be there as he does," she thought, referring to the fact that Tom Paris was sure to be found on the Holodeck at this time of night. She swung into the bar and noticed that several of the crewmen smiled on recognizing her figure.  Perhaps Seven was right, maybe all I need to do is give them a chance.</p>
<p>She stepped up to the bar and ordered a beer.  Turning around she scouted out an empty table and sat down.  She threw her head back and gulped down half the beer, gasping for breath as the ice-cold liquid slid down her throat.  She listened to the music and finished her beer. She obtained another beer and was nursing this one more slowly, enjoying her solitude, when she noticed the doors to the holodeck open and Seven of Nine enter the room.</p>
<p>Seven scanned the room and found was she was looking for, alone at a table at the back of the bar.  </p>
<p>After her duty shift had ended Seven had decided to do some research in an effort to understand the physical reactions she was having while in close proximity to the engineer.  She had been shocked by what she found, but despite her best efforts she could not find a better explanation.  So, seeing B'Elanna alone in the bar she strode purposely through press of bodies and right up to the Klingon's table.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was unnerved at the sight of the young Borg bearing down on her table and so she covered, "hey there stranger, what's a beautiful girl like you doing in a joint like this," she drawled in imitation of a film she had once seen with Tom.</p>
<p>Seven regarded her seriously, "Lieutenant Torres, are you damaged&#133; perhaps some of your memory engrams have been erased or your ocular nerve is malfunctioning&#133;I believe you should report to sickbay immediately."</p>
<p>"Relax Seven, it's just a joke."  B'Elanna started to explain, stopping when she noticed a crooked smile on Seven's face and her raised ocular implant.  "Was that, a joke," she queried?  If possible Seven's ocular implant rose even further.</p>
<p>"God Seven I think you're smirking."</p>
<p>"Borg do not smirk," Seven's voice was again without inflection.  After a pause she relaxed her face and continued, "however half-human former drone's HAVE been known, on occasion, to&#133;smirk."  Seven smiled shyly at B'Elanna.</p>
<p>"Not bad for a beginner," B'Elanna laughed.  "So, Seven, what are you doing here.  I didn't think the holodeck was your cup of tea."</p>
<p>"Normally I would not bother with such entertainment, but I asked the computer where you were and it told me you were here, so&#133;" Seven's voice trailed off.</p>
<p>"So&#133;what?" B'Elanna queried.</p>
<p>Seven steeled herself to reply when they were interrupted by the unwelcome presence of Tom Paris and several of his inebriated friends.</p>
<p>"Hey guys, check this out, if it isn't beauty and the beast" he snorted.</p>
<p>B'Elanna felt her temper rise even as she started out of her seat to knock the mocking look off the helmsman's face.  She was blocked in her efforts however as it was Seven who stood toe to toe with the laughing Lieutenant.  She stepped forward and Tom stumbled back, afraid of what might happen to him if he angered the Borg further.  </p>
<p>"Leave us," she commanded, her blue eyes boring into his, now frightened, eyes.  </p>
<p>Without a word Tom retreated to the other end of the bar where he contented himself with casting dirty looks at the Borg's back and making crude comments about the two of them to his group of drunken friends.</p>
<p>"Impressive," B'Elanna remarked as Seven sat back down and visibly wrestled her anger back under control.</p>
<p>"He is a willful child.  Naomi Wildman has more discipline than&#133;that," Seven spat.</p>
<p>"Still, thanks&#133;I probably would have hit him and done some brig time if you hadn't stepped in."</p>
<p>B'Elanna was sincere in her thanks&#133;"I've never had anyone stick up for me before.  I'm supposed to be the Klingon warrior you know; I guess people just take it for granted I can take care of myself."</p>
<p>"I have no doubt you can 'take care of yourself,' but if you are in the brig we will never finish the refinements to the dilithium matrix&#133;my solution seemed more efficient." </p>
<p>B'Elanna grinned happily "Borg humour&#133;will wonders never cease.  So you came here to drag me back to work on the formulas is that it," B'Elanna asked?</p>
<p>"What?" </p>
<p>Seven was lost in her observation of the look of happiness on B'Elanna's face and suddenly was shy of revealing her true purpose in coming to the holodeck that evening.  "Oh&#133;yes, I thought perhaps we could go over the formulas tonight if you don't mind," Seven covered. </p>
<p>B'Elanna finished her beer in one long pull and stood, motioning for Seven to lead the way.  They walked back to B'Elanna's quarters together and spent several hours refining the formulas.  B'Elanna was longing to ask Seven why she had so abruptly rejected her after their dinner only to seek her out again a few days later.  Seven, for her part, wished to discuss the findings of her research with the young Klingon, but neither of them was ready to risk the easy manner in which they were now working. As they finished their work Seven rose and walked to the door.  B'Elanna was not about to make the same mistake twice so this time she merely smiled and wished Seven a good night.  While neither of them was completely satisfied by this, they were both relieved to have ended the evening without further misunderstandings. </p>
