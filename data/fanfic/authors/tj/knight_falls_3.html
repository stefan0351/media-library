<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 3 -->

<p>Harry awoke the next morning to unfamiliar sounds nearby.  When he rolled over and opened his eyes he saw the bizarre sight of B'Elanna laying flat on her back hoisting a large rock up and down, accompanied by her groans of effort.</p>
<p>"What in God's name are you doing B'Elanna?"</p>
<p>"I am attempting to increase my physical strength in preparation for the tournaments."</p>
<p>"What does heaving a rock around have to do with increasing strength?"</p>
<p>"I once asked my father why the smithy in town had such huge muscles as compared to most men. He said that it was because of all of the heavy iron the smithy lifted as well as the wielding of the heavy hammer he used to mold the iron.   So I believe that if I practice lifting heavy things with great regularity I will become stronger like the smithy."</p>
<p>Harry shook his head at the outlandish ideas of his friend.  He did however wish to be useful so he walked out into the woods in search of edible berries and nuts.  This was one area in which his knowledge exceeded that of his friend and he was determined to contribute.  He returned a half-hour later to find B'Elanna hanging from the branch of a tree pulling her chin up to the branch of the tree repeatedly.  Upon seeing Harry return she dropped lightly to the ground and went to investigate his findings.</p>
<p>"These are great Harry but if I'm to grow stronger we're going to need to eat more than this.  We need more meat.  We should go hunting."</p>
<p>She uncovered their supplies and picked up the crossbow.  She was surprised to see Harry pick up the longbow and the quiver of arrows.  She was pleased that he was attempting to help her though and so she merely smiled her pleasure at his actions and covered the supplies back up before leading the way into the bush.  They walked quietly keeping a sharp eye out for any movement in the underbrush.  In the distance she saw partridge pecking at the ground.  She motioned Harry closer and whispered that she needed to be much closer to make the shot with her crossbow, and indicated he should follow her quietly.  She was surprised when Harry shook his head.  He nocked an arrow into the long bow and began to take aim.  She suppressed a surge of irritation at his actions, but it was early in the hunt, let him learn his lesson the hard way when he failed to hit his target from this distance and their breakfast flew away.</p>
<p>Harry's face was a picture of concentration as he drew down on the bird.  He loosed the arrow with a twang and to B'Elanna's surprise the arrow flew straight to bird's heart, felling it perfectly.  Harry grinned at the slack jawed look of surprise on his friend's face.</p>
<p>"Hey, that's one thing we nobles are good at," he teased.  "I had archery lessons almost everyday along with my reading and writing lessons. It is like a parlour game, something the men can do to wile away the afternoon with the Ladies."</p>
<p>B'Elanna could only shake her head at the things she was beginning to find out about her friend.  She slapped him on the back,</p>
<p>"Come on, let's go get our breakfast."</p>
<p>B'Elanna plucked and dressed the bird while Harry lit a fire.  They stuffed the onions B'Elanna had taken into the cavity and shoved the bird on a spit Harry had devised.  As the bird roasted they picked up swords and began to practice.  B'Elanna had Harry use the longsword with its superiour reach, and she defended with the short sword.  Even with his advantage Harry was unable to penetrate B'Elanna's defenses.  They practiced for over an hour.  Harry was exhausted but B'Elanna had barely broken a sweat.  She knew that she needed to be in superiour phsyical condition, as she would be wearing over 50lbs of armour in the blazing sun when she competed at the tournaments.</p>
<p>When the bird was done roasting they fell on it ravenously, devouring it down to the last morsel of meat before they sucked the marrow from the bones, and fell back sated onto the hard ground.  They had decided that today was a good day to make an attempt to divine where they were.  They were going to cross the river and look for a road that would take them to a town.  Generally speaking the roads tended to follow the rivers and the towns tended to be built on the rivers as well, so they were hoping they would not have far to go before they came upon some sign of civilization.</p>
<p>Harry began to tutor B'Elanna on what he considered to be the fine art of acting like a man, and a noble at that.  He watched her walk and attempted to demonstrate the required swagger of a young Lord.  B'Elanna was a natural physically and soon he was satisfied that, at least from a distance, she could pass.  He used her dagger and in one stroke cut the long braid of hair from her back and then attempted to fashion what was left into some semblance of order.  Given the circumstances it didn't turn out too badly he thought.  He was grateful that the fashion of the day was for men of nobility to be clean-shaven, in the end B'Elanna could easily pass for a young knight of the day.  As to her accent and her manner of speaking that was going to take more time.  For today he attempted to correct what he considered to be her more egregious flaws and advised her to speak as little as possible, allowing him to do most of the talking.</p>
<p>Their last task was the most difficult.  They sacrificed one of the cloaks by cutting it into wide bands of cloth.  B'Elanna removed her tunic and turned her back as Harry began to wind the cloth around her chest, pulling it tight to hide the swell of her bosom.</p>
<p>"Never forget you are less than an inch away from a swift and painless death Lord Harry," she admonished as his arms encircled her from behind.</p>
<p>"I assure you my friend, your virtue is completely safe with me," he joked in return.</p>
<p>When they were finished B'Elanna redressed in her tunic.  The effect of the binding was to make her seem as if she had a more powerful and muscular chest; her appearance gave no hint of the womanly form that was now hidden beneath her clothing.  It took a while before she was used to breathing under the restrictive clothing, but after a while she almost forgot it was there.</p>
<p>They gathered up their gear and put out the fire before heading toward the river.  They rode downstream for quite a way until they found a suitable place to ford the current.  Once on the other side they rode in what they hoped was a straight line for a considerable distance before striking the road.  They turned onto the pathway and rode in silence until they came to the first mile marker, which informed them they were only 5 miles from the village of Bedfordshire.  They saw no one on the road in either direction and so they continued their journey toward the town.  Once they were about a half-mile from the village they could now see in the distance, they turned off the road and once again hid their supplies and most of their coins beneath a tree.</p>
<p>They divided the remaining coins between themselves and turned back toward the village.  B'Elanna felt a flutter of nervousness in her stomach as they entered the town.  This was to be the first true test of her plan, if she could pass without question here then she would gain the confidence she needed to attempt the next part of their scheme.  They rode the complete length of the town before turning back toward the inn.  The town was sufficiently small to not have a full forge.  They would have to search elsewhere for armour and weapons, but there was a small open-air marketplace and they took heart at the thought of being able to purchase some of the supplies they needed.</p>
<p>They left their horses at the stables, paying a young urchin a halfpenny to see to the needs of their mounts, and then they wandered through the marketplace.  Harry made several small purchases, but B'Elanna was content to merely look at the goods on the tables and say nothing.</p>
<p>When they had walked the length of the market Harry led B'Elanna a small distance away before whispering,</p>
<p>"There are several suits of clothing there that seem suitable.  You are going to have to dress differently if you are going to pass.  You also need different footwear.  Let me do the talking, just nod and look bored."</p>
<p>"That should not be a problem.  What does it matter how I dress.  These clothes are in perfectly good shape."</p>
<p>"Yes, for a peasant they are, but you are a nobleman now, and you need to dress the part.  You know I'm right, just follow my lead."</p>
<p>In the end B'Elanna relented and allowed Harry to barter for some clothing and footwear on her behalf.  When they were finished with their purchases Harry talked B'Elanna into taking a room at the inn for the evening.  He was aching to have a bath and a meal that was accompanied by plates and flatware.  B'Elanna felt like it was a needless waste of money, but Harry had been so good-natured about sleeping in the woods and helping out with the hunting and work that she finally relented.  She too was looking forward to a bath and a night in a real bed.</p>
<p>Harry once again did the talking and procured a room with two beds.  He engaged the young servant girl to bring up the bath as soon as the water was heated.  When they got to the room they both collapsed on the beds, giggling like a couple of children.</p>
<p>"Hey, we need a name for you," Harry sat up suddenly at the realization that B'Elanna was hardly a suitable name for a nobleman.</p>
<p>"I suppose you're right.  But we need to make it as close to B'Elanna as possible so I won't look like I can't remember my own name in the beginning."</p>
<p>"How about Beyla, or Beylannar?something like that."</p>
<p>"Beyla is short and sweet.  Do you think it sounds noble enough?"</p>
<p>"I think so?we can make up a suitable history for you later.  We are going to have to find someone to forge some papers for you at some point.  Won't matter at these small tournaments, but as we get closer to London you may have to offer proof of nobility to enter the more popular tournaments.  So Lord Beyla de Torrance it is then."</p>
<p>"Maybe we should change my last name as well.  We don't want anyone putting two and two together down the road should anyone from our region be at the tournaments in the future."</p>
<p>"All right, Lord Beylannar de la Torre, but we'll use Beyla for short.  What do you think?"</p>
<p>"You're the expert Harry, if you say so I'll go along with it."</p>
<p>"My father had a friend by that last name, I think it will be fine."</p>
<p>"Lord Beyla it is then."</p>
<p>Their discussion was just over when there was a knock at the door and the chambermaid came in carrying a large copper boiler.  She placed it on the floor in front of the fireplace and carried several steaming buckets of water.  A few trips later and the steaming bath was ready.  Harry tipped the chambermaid and assured her that his 'Lordship' required no further assistance right now and sent her on her way.</p>
<p>He helped B'Elanna undo the wraps on her chest and then lay down on his bed, politely staring at the ceiling while his friend scrubbed herself clean.  When she got out of the bath he helped her dress again, and then sat her down to trim her hair properly now that he had managed to purchase some barber's tools for the purpose at the marketplace.  When he was done he called the chambermaid to bring fresh water and then sank gratefully into his own bath.</p>
<p>When they were both clean and dressed in their new clothes they proceeded downstairs for a meal.  Harry had to remind himself more than once to act deferentially to his new friend and he had to stifle a giggle when he introduced her by her new name to the men they were sharing a table with.  When dinner was through one of the men pulled out a deck of cards and invited Lord Beyla to play with them.  Harry was a little worried, but B'Elanna managed to participate in the game with a minimum of talking, and the accent they had been practicing seemed to be holding up.  The game progressed and one of the players suggested a friendly wager, and B'Elanna accepted.  Harry wanted to stop her but knew that a valet would never dare speak to his master in such a manner so he could only watch in silence as B'Elanna began to bet with some of their precious money.</p>
<p>He breathed a sigh of relief when he realized that B'Elanna was a skilled cardsman and the stakes were minimal.  At the end of the night B'Elanna had won just enough to cover the cost of the room and their baths.  She shook hands with the other players and they retired for the evening.  The night couldn't have gone better as far as they were concerned.  B'Elanna appeared to be having no problem passing in public and they had replenished their supply of coins somewhat.  The both slept the sleep of the dead in the warm comfortable rooms, feeling a sense of ease for the first time since their nightmare had begun.</p>
<p>They were up early the next morning and had breakfast in front of a roaring fire.  They felt a little more relaxed in public today and they fell easily into their respective roles.  They retrieved their horses from the stable and made some inquiries into the closest town with a smithy who could produce a set of armour for B'Elanna.  Once they had the directions they rode back out to the tree under which they had hidden their belongings.  They loaded up their horses and set off for Hartfordshire to outfit Lord Beyla with the necessary gear.</p>
<p>As they rode Harry continued his tutelage of B'Elanna on the ways of the nobility, all the while correcting her accent whenever possible.  He was pleased to see that she was a natural mimic and a quick learner and he actually began to believe that they might be able to pull this off, for at least a little while.</p>
<p>When they reached the town containing the forge they went through their usual routine of hiding their belongings in the forest before entering the village.  Harry did all of the negotiating with the smithy regarding the suit of armour but the older man seemed to take it for granted that the young Lord would allow his man to do most of the talking.  B'Elanna gritted her teeth and endured the old man poking and prodding at her body while he measured her for her mail.  She was relieved when that part of the process was finished however, and all that was left was to return every day or so to be fitted with the pieces that were finished so any adjustments could be made.</p>
<p>She and Harry had both agreed that they needed to hoard their dwindling supply of money and so they were sleeping in the woods outside of town.  This also gave them more room and privacy for practicing and the reading lessons Harry was giving to B'Elanna as they worked on her fighting skills.  B'Elanna was excited when the day finally came for them to pick up the finished suit of armour.  She was anxious to try it on as she saw the burnished black finish gleaming in the sunlight. Once she had managed to get the entire suit on for the first time, she went outside and ran through several of her practice drills in order to see how the armour would feel when she was fighting.  She was more than pleased with the fit and freedom of the mail and gladly paid the smithy his asking price.</p>
<p>They divided the pieces of the armour up into two sacks and split the load between the horses.  Once they had retrieved all of their belongings they headed in the direction of the nearest county tournament for Lord Beyla's entrance into his first competition.  B'Elanna was a little disappointed to say the least when they reached the putative tournament 'grounds.'  The entire thing was little more than an open field with one tent where the knights went to indicate in which events they would participate.  Harry wandered around the grounds for a while listening to conversations and gathering enough information to guide their decisions as to what B'Elanna should attempt her first time out.  Acting as her herald Harry entered her into the general ransom melee rounds and the individual longsword on foot.  Having taken care of the details for his 'Lord' he returned to their encampment to help his friend don her armour for the games.</p>
<p>B'Elanna adjusted quickly to the feeling of being mounted in her armour and enjoyed the ride to the grounds.  The young children of the nearby countryside eagerly ran alongside her horse, looking up in wonder at what they presumed to be a real knight.  B'Elanna controlled her instinct to laugh and joke with the urchins and instead kept her head up and her eyes forward.  Harry took control of her horse when they reached the grounds and helped her tighten her armour and fasten on her helmet.  He also delivered the three small piles of coins to the officials at the table as part of the general melee and ransom rounds.</p>
<p>B'Elanna waited while the two eldest knights chose sides for the melee.  Her small stature made them ignore her until the end and she was embarrassed to be the last one chosen for a team.  The other knights ribbed her about her small size, but she was determined to let her sword do the talking and so did not take the bait.  The object of the game was to capture knights from the other side.  Every time you knocked a man down or in the opinion of the judges defeated him soundly you took possession of one of his piles of coins; in turn if you were knocked down or defeated you forfeited one of your own piles.  When you were out of coins you had to leave the field, although you could leave at any time you desired if you felt you had won enough money.</p>
<p>B'Elanna and Harry had already decided that if she doubled her pile of coins she should retire so as to save her strength for the bigger rewards available in single combat.  B'Elanna formed with the line of knights in the centre of the field and waited with a pounding heart for the signal for battle to begin.  When the flag was dropped she raised her sword and ran into the fray with her companions.  This was far more difficult than she had imagined.  She was instantly sweating and the stinging in her eyes blinded her almost instantly.  To her shame she was knocked down almost immediately by a blow from behind.  She staggered to her feet and almost fell again as a pair of men who were fighting fiercely nearby bumped into her.  She tried to get her bearings and found herself facing one of the larger knights from the other side.  She forced herself to remain calm as she began to circle the man slowly.  To her shame she was instantly set upon from behind and dragged to the ground by one of his companions; she had been set up and she'd fallen for it perfectly.  One more loss like this and she was out of the game.  She took a moment to rest before regaining her feet.  This time she went on the offensive with a snarl and engaged the nearest man from the opposite side.  She easily parried his blows and when she allowed him to thrust fiercely inside her circle of defense she raised her sword and brought it down soundly on his shoulder.  She pressed her advantage savagely and was rewarded when he fell to his knees in defeat.  She was still having trouble seeing and had to force herself to listen intently for the sounds of battle around her, not wishing to fall victim to another ambush. Seeing an opening in the fray she rushed in and quickly defeated another of her foes.  The round seemed interminable, but eventually she doubled her money and retired from the field with honour.</p>
<p>Harry was at her side instantly, removing her helmet and helping her into a seat.</p>
<p>"You had me worried for a second there Beyla, but you really came through."  He handed her a flagon of water and trotted off to the officials to retrieve their winnings.  When he returned he loosened the armour and sat at her feet and watched the rest of the match.  It was obvious that several of the knights had carefully formed alliances before the melee began and working together two of them managed to split the prize between them.</p>
<p>Harry took some of their coins and purchased some meat and mead for them before the individual sword trials began.  He had learned the rules beforehand and imparted them to B'Elanna as they ate.  Essentially you had to bring a man to his knees, or score three blows on the shoulders or above to be declared a winner.  However there was a time limit and the judges would award the match to the best fighter if the criteria were not met before the time was up. Blows to other areas of the body did not count as 'strikes' but would be considered by the judges in determining a winner should the time limit be exceeded.</p>
<p>They were calling the bans for the individual sword fights so Harry helped B'Elanna back into her armour and escorted her to the lists.  Her fight was second and so she watched carefully as the two men ahead of her squared off against one another.  To her critical eye she could see that their technique was unschooled and she believed she would be victorious in a bout with either of them.  When her turn came she entered the lists and raised her sword in a brief salute to her companion.  When the flag was dropped she charged forward instantly, landing a blow on the man's shoulder before he could even react.  The crowd cheered and she circled around him slowly looking for an advantage.  He tried several times to land a blow but she parried his attempts with ease.  After warding off yet another ineffectual blow B'Elanna raised her sword and rained down several blows in quick succession until she managed to score another hit.  The crowd was chanting her name now as she closed with her opponent for the final blow.  It was over just like that, he left himself defenseless when he swung wildly at her head and she quickly finished him off.  She bowed to the crowd and left the lists to wait for her next match.</p>
<p>Harry was ecstatic with her performance.  She had been magnificent.  He had heard the crowd buzzing about the new knight and he had taken the opportunity to start a few rumours about her origins that would lay the groundwork for their calculated deception.  Sir Beyla needed a history and Harry was enjoying creating one today.</p>
<p>She won all of her matches without a single blow being scored against her until the final bout.  The large knight who had split the ransom melee winnings with his friend was her last opponent.  He was much larger and stronger than she was and he had had some combat experience in his life.  B'Elanna was wary of him and gave him little opportunity to close with her while she poked and prodded at him, looking for an opening that would allow her to make contact.  When she finally moved in he easily parried her blows and scored a hit quite quickly.  B'Elanna shook he head to clear the ringing from her ears and moved forward once more, she feinted to the right and as he took the bait she brought her sword down on his shoulder with all her might.  For an instant she thought he was going to fall, but he steadied himself just before he went down.  B'Elanna was fierce in pressing her advantage.  She moved with impossible speed to score another hit before he could fully regain his balance and to her delight he crumpled to the ground before she could draw her weapon back for another blow.  The crowd was yelling wildly and chanting her name.  She raised her sword in a victory salute to the people as she left the lists with Harry.</p>
<p>The two young friends had to work very hard to not appear to be too happy with their victory, and it was all Harry could do to stop himself from hugging B'Elanna once he removed her helmet.  Her hair was slick with sweat and he hastened to bring her water and clean off her face before the award ceremony.</p>
<p>B'Elanna stood in the line of men about to receive their rewards from the local Lord.  She had to fight to keep a silly grin off of her face as she waited for the Lord to get to her reward.  She bent her head to receive the gold medallion and almost flinched when the Lord's wife kissed her on the cheek.  She managed to keep her wits about her and not burst into laughter as the Lord intoned his speech and invited all of the participants to the banquet in their honour this evening at his hall in town.</p>
<p>When the ceremony was over she and Harry mounted their horses and returned to their campsite in the woods.  Once they were out of earshot of the crowd they began to laugh hysterically at their feat.  Harry teased her mercilessly about the kiss of the Lady of the county.  He helped her out of her armour and suggested that she bathe in the river before the banquet that night.</p>
<p>"You can't be thinking that we're actually going to this banquet Harry, not a chance. I won't know what to do or say."</p>
<p>"You have to go B'Elanna.  You're going to need the practice for the larger tournaments.  I'll help you get through it.  Besides we could use the food remember."</p>
<p>B'Elanna, who was herself starving, finally gave in and agreed to attend the festivities.  They both bathed in the river and changed into their new clothes before riding into town for the feast.  There were several young men at the door who were taking care of the horses and as instructed B'Elanna tossed the reins to them carelessly along with a coin for their services before she entered the house.</p>
<p>The Lord's manor could not compare to Lord Kim's manor and so B'Elanna was immediately at her ease inside.  She spoke little, merely nodding her acceptance of compliments as she circulated throughout the room with Harry on her heels.  They ate as much as they could stand, not being sure where their next meal was coming from.  One of the Lord's young daughters had been staring at B'Elanna ever since the awards ceremony and she was now emboldened enough to approach the handsome young knight.</p>
<p>"Good evening my Lord."</p>
<p>"Good evening."</p>
<p>"Your victory this afternoon was impressive.  Sir Archibald has never lost at tournament until today."</p>
<p>B'Elanna was beginning to sweat all over again, as she had no idea what to say to this young girl.</p>
<p>"I believe that luck was on my side."  In the end that was all she could think of to say.</p>
<p>"I believe it was your strength and superiour skill," the young woman replied, reaching out boldly to feel the muscles in the arm of the warrior.</p>
<p>B'Elanna thought she was going to pass out in her anxiety to end this exchange, and finally Harry was forced to come to her rescue and invent an excuse for them to leave the party.  He nudged B'Elanna in the side to remind her of her chivalric duty and she took the hand of the young lady, kissing it softly and wishing the now swooning girl a good evening before they made their way from the room.</p>
