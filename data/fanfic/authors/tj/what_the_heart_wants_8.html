<!-- What the Heart Wants \ Chapter 8 -->

</p>
<p>B'Elanna was halfway to the door when the Doctor called out, "on one condition Lieutenant."</p>
<p>The young Klingon turned slowly around, "what," she asked cautiously.</p>
<p>"You are to remain in your quarters for at least five days.  I don't want you out and interacting with the crew until I've checked you out one last time.  I am placing you in Seven's care.  I trust her to be able to keep you under control for five days," he finished sternly.</p>
<p>"Ok, fine, no problem, come on Seven lets get out of here," B'Elanna was headed for the door again.</p>
<p>"I'm serious.  Seven, make sure she does no work, that she eats properly, and that she doesn't have visitors or leave her quarters.  I'm holding you responsible for this. I also want you to check with me every day before you visit B'Elanna so I can run scans to ensure you aren't carrying anything back with you."</p>
<p>"I will see that she complies," Seven stated emphatically and turned to escort B'Elanna from the room.</p>
<p>"Wait, I want you to use a site to site transport, I meant what I said, she is not to be exposed to the rest of the crew."  Seven and B'Elanna waited patiently until the familiar pull of the transporter beam moved them to the living room of B'Elanna's quarters.</p>
<p>"Alright!  Freedom," B'Elanna was positively giddy as found herself back in her own room.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna, I meant what I said to the Doctor, I intend to see to it that you follow his instructions to the letter." Seven's voice was stern.</p>
<p>"Oh, come on Seven, he was just being overprotective.  There's no reason I can't just slip out to engineering for a few minutes, or go for a walk."</p>
<p>Seven sighed as she realized the enormity of her task.  "I would have thought you would rather spend this time with me than with your engines," Seven's pout was only partially acting.</p>
<p>B'Elanna had the good grace to look abashed as she realized she had caused Seven to feel that she took second place to engineering for the second time in their short relationship.  "Kahless, I keep doing this Seven.  I'm sorry.  I do want to spend the time with you.  I'm thrilled to be home, and have you all to myself, and I'm grateful that you agreed to help out or the Doc never would've let me out of sickbay."  </p>
<p>Seven smiled shyly, her doubts relieved by the vehemence of B'Elanna's words, "then I believe the least you could do would be to kiss me."</p>
<p>B'Elanna didn't need to be asked twice.  She swept Seven into her arms and took her breath away with the passion of her kiss.</p>
<p>When they finally broke apart Seven shooed B'Elanna into the shower and began to prepare dinner for them both.</p>
<p>Seven looked up from her dinner preparations as B'Elanna came into the room.  She was clad in her old sweats and looked thin and very young, her heart constricted to see her love looking so fragile.  She was more determined than ever to see that B'Elanna followed the Doctor's orders to the letter.</p>
<p>"Smells great Seven, I didn't realize that you were such a cook," B'Elanna remarked as she made her way to the couch to rest before dinner.  </p>
<p>"Mr. Neelix has been giving me lessons," Seven stated.  "Do not worry, we have agreed to disagree on the matter of proper spicing procedures," she added upon seeing the worried look on B'Elanna's face.</p>
<p>B'Elanna sat in silence watching Seven finish making the meal.  "Do you know you always stick the tip of your mouth out when you're concentrating on slicing or stirring something?"</p>
<p>Seven blushed, "I was unaware."</p>
<p>"Hey, don't be embarrassed, I think it is the most adorable thing I've ever seen," B'Elanna hastened to reassure her.  This caused Seven's blush to deepen considerably, as she carried the plates to the table.</p>
<p>After the meal was finished and cleared away, B'Elanna took Seven by the hand and led her to the couch.  She sat down and pulled the younger woman into her arms, holding her tightly.  "There's something we need to talk about&#133;something I need to tell you Seven." She could feel Seven's body stiffen and try to pull away at her words.  The worry was evident in the young Borg's eyes.  "No, no, Seven, nothing bad I promise.  Its just something I have been thinking about ever since I woke up in sickbay and I don't want to wait any longer."  B'Elanna fervently hoped she was doing the right thing.  "Seven, I nearly died in that fire fight, and it really made me see that life is short.  We're out here in this dangerous, unfamiliar place and anything can happen.  I almost died before I could really tell you what you mean to me, so I don't want to wait any longer before I do.  I, Seven of Nine, I love you. I love you with all my heart&#133;I know this seems fast, we really just found each other, but I don't want to hold anything back anymore."</p>
<p>Tears were running down Seven's cheeks and B'Elanna was worried that she had upset the young woman, and terrified that her feelings weren't returned.</p>
<p>"Seven, please say something," B'Elanna begged.</p>
<p>"I am afraid," Seven's words were barely audible.</p>
<p>"Afraid of what Seven?"</p>
<p>"Afraid of losing you, afraid that you will change your mind once you have spent more time with me. Afraid that you will find out that a drone can never love you back the way you deserve.  I am afraid of how much I love you."  Seven's look bore into B'Elanna.  "I do love you B'Elanna Torres."</p>
<p>Relieved at finally hearing the words, B'Elanna pulled Seven back into her arms.  "I am never going to stop loving you Seven.  You are everything I've ever dreamed of, and I will always love you."  </p>
<p>Seven buried her head in B'Elanna's shoulder and allowed herself to be comforted as if she were a child.  Finally she spoke.  "I believe that I am also feeling guilty."</p>
<p>"Guilty about what?"</p>
<p>There was a long silence as Seven tried to put what she was feeling into words.</p>
<p>"As a part of the Borg I was guilty of terrible crimes.  I stole the lives of so many people, destroyed so many worlds.  I have never been punished for these crimes.  Once I was severed from the collective and began my life on Voyager I tried to atone for these crimes by helping out the people on this ship.  I have never stopped regretting my actions as a Borg.  I learned to despise the collective and everything they stood for. I remained alone and separate on Voyager, the rest of the crew still sees me as Borg, and I allowed that to become a part of my penance.  As long as I was feeling alone and guilty I could believe I was somehow being brought to justice in some small way for my crimes.  But now I am not alone, and I am happy.  I cannot reconcile my happiness in the present with my actions in the past.  How can I hate the Borg when they brought me to you."</p>
<p>"Seven, sweetie, you can't help what you did when you were a part of the collective, you had no control.  As to being punished, I think losing almost 20 years of your life, your entire childhood, your teenage years, I think that's punishment enough.  No one expects you to atone for your crimes by being lonely for the rest of your life.  The best you can do is accept what happened in the past, and embrace what is happening now.  You have saved Voyager on more than one occasion using knowledge that you gained from the Borg.  Maybe that's how you can honour those people who were assimilated, to use their knowledge to help others.  As to being glad that the Borg brought us together, in some small way I guess I've been feeling the same conflict.  I feel terrible about everything that happened to you, but it made you the person you are, the person I love, so maybe I owe a debt of gratitude to the Borg as well.  I do know we don't need to figure this all out tonight."  B'Elanna was emotionally drained by her outburst and allowed her head to rest on Seven's as they wept together for everything they had lost, and all that they had gained.</p>
<p>Much later, noticing that B'Elanna had drifted off, Seven gathered B'Elanna into her arms and effortlessly carried her into the bedroom. B'Elanna woke as Seven was tucking the blankets around her.  "Stay with me Seven," she murmured as she held onto the younger woman's hand.  Seven acquiesced and changed into the sleepwear B'Elanna had leant her previously.  She crawled into bed and wrapped her arms around the engineer, kissing her gently before they fell asleep.</p>
<p>B'Elanna woke the next morning, feeling the bed move as Seven got up to get ready for work. She heard the sonic shower activate and dozed back off, only awakening again at the feel of someone kissing her.  She responded to the kiss, pulling Seven back into the bed with her, letting her hands roam over the young drone's back.  She loved the feel of Seven's body lying over hers, and she arched up into the contact, hearing Seven moan as their bodies pressed closely together.  </p>
<p>It took all of Seven's considerable willpower to pull herself away from B'Elanna's embrace.  "We have to stop," she whimpered.  "You must eat breakfast and I must get to work."</p>
<p>"If we skip breakfast we can keep doing this," B'Elanna pleaded.</p>
<p>"Nno, you need to eat, Doctor's orders," Seven stated firmly levering herself up off the bed.  She smiled indulgently at B'Elanna's pout before turning to walk out of the bedroom.</p>
<p>B'Elanna followed a little while later, only slightly cheered at the sight of her favourite breakfast prepared on the table.</p>
<p>"So what are you working on today," B'Elanna asked nonchalantly?</p>
<p>Seven was not fooled by the engineer's feigned indifference.  "I have several scans to complete of nearby sectors."</p>
<p>"Sounds interesting," she fibbed, "what about engineering?"</p>
<p>"That, my dear, is not your concern for 5 more days."</p>
<p>B'Elanna knew when she was beaten.</p>
<p>After they tidied away the dishes B'Elanna walked Seven to the door of her quarters.  She wrapped her arms around her and kissed her joking, "have a nice day honey."</p>
<p>Seven put her hands on either side of B'Elanna's face, looking deeply into her eyes. "I want you to promise me that you will follow the Doctor's orders today and simply rest.  I almost lost you once, I do not wish feel that pain again."</p>
<p>B'Elanna promised to be good and was rewarded with a passionate kiss and a promise that Seven would be back at lunch.</p>
<p>B'Elanna prowled around her quarters like a caged Targ.  She smiled to herself when she noticed that Seven had cleared all the PADDs and tools from her console.  She hefted her Bat'leth thinking she might use the time to practice, but she tired quickly and decided to take a nap. She awoke to the sound of her door as Seven entered carrying two trays from the messhall.</p>
<p>"Wow, I guess I really drifted off there."</p>
<p>"I am glad to see that you are taking the Doctor's orders so seriously," Seven smiled.</p>
<p>"This has nothing to do with the Doctor, I promised you I'd be good, so that's that."</p>
<p>"A very mature attitude."</p>
<p>B'Elanna couldn't think of an answer to that so had to settle for sticking her tongue out.</p>
<p>Seven stayed until she was certain that B'Elanna had consumed sufficient food, and then she went back to work.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna was once again alone with little to do.  She listened to some music, took a shower, and flopped back on the couch.  She curled up, thinking about the past weeks and everything that Seven had come to mean to her.  The truth was she was terrified at the depths of her feelings for the young woman.  B'Elanna had learned early in life never to want too much.  She had always been careful to have very small dreams, that way she ensured she would only suffer very small disappointments.  She knew that if you didn't want things, and tried not to care too much about them if you had them, then you wouldn't be devastated when you inevitably lost them.  Now here she was involved in something that had the power to tear her very soul apart, and destroy her heart should something go wrong. She had never wanted anything this much since a very young half-Klingon had begged Kahless nightly to send her father back to her.</p>
<p>She was interrupted from her morose thoughts when her comm badge activated with a beep.</p>
<p>&lt;Seven of Nine to Torres&gt;</p>
<p>She leaned over to the coffee table to tap her badge.</p>
<p>&lt;Torres here&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Is everything all right&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Sure Seven, I'm fine, why? &gt;</p>
<p>&lt;I, I am, uncertain.  I suppose I was just concerned. &gt;</p>
<p>&lt;I'm fine sweetie, better still now that I've heard your voice. &gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Very well, but please try to stay out of trouble.  I will know if you misbehave. &gt;  Seven used her best Borg voice, her stern demeanor only betrayed by her laughter after she spoke.</p>
<p>&lt;I love you too Seven, Torres out. &gt;</p>
<p>B'Elanna was in a decidedly better mood after Seven's call, and she began to think about their relationship and where it was heading.  She knew she wanted to wait to make love to Seven until the timing was perfect. Seven's first time should be perfect.  She thought about the various holoprograms other couples aboard the ship had used, and went so far as to scan through a listing of several of them.  None of them seemed quite right however. She fell into thought and suddenly a smile spread over her face. This was going to be perfect.  It was also going to be a lot of work, much of which she could accomplish right from her console.  Finally happy to have found something to occupy her time, she set to work.</p>
<p>She was still hunched over her console happily working when Seven returned after her duty shift ended. </p>
<p>"I thought you promised to follow the Doctor's orders and rest," she stated severely upon seeing B'Elanna at her workstation.</p>
<p>"I'm not working, I promise."</p>
<p>Seven walked over and saw the program open on the console.  "You are designing a holoprogram?" She was a little surprised, as B'Elanna had never evinced an interest in such things before.  "What are you programming."</p>
<p>"It's a surprise sweetie.  I promise not to overdo Ok."</p>
<p>"Very well, since you promise," she paused before smiling sweetly, "now put your toys away and come and eat."</p>
<p>B'Elanna happily saved her work and went to have dinner with the most beautiful woman she had ever known.</p>
<p>After dinner B'Elanna led Seven to the sofa and produced the PADD that contained the ancient, earth novel <u>Beloved</u>. Seven sat down with her back braced against the arm of the sofa and her feet up.  B'Elanna positioned herself between Seven's legs, leaning back against her for support.  The young drone wrapped her arms around her engineer, holding her closely as they began to read the novel together.  Seven was moved by the story of the young mother who was so haunted by the past, and she understood why B'Elanna felt the story applied to both of them. </p>
<p>The five days passed quickly in this manner.  After the first night Seven no longer slept with B'Elanna, but she was there for every meal, and she grew to love the feeling of taking care of her beloved.  They spent some time each night reading the novel and talking about what they had read.  Seven could not imagine a feeling of greater contentment than holding her lover in her arms each night as they read.  She tucked B'Elanna into bed before she left, a task which seemed to take a little longer every night, and then returned to her alcove to regenerate. Unbeknownst to B'Elanna, at least once each night Seven interrupted her regeneration cycle for an hour or so and made her way back to the young Klingon's quarters to watch over her as she slept.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The morning of the sixth day B'Elanna was up early.  She showered and put on her uniform for the first time in almost a month.  It felt good.  She was already out in the living room when Seven came in for their usual breakfast together.  While happy that B'Elanna was well again, she was going to miss looking after the young engineer, and she knew that she might not see as much of her now that she was sure to throw herself back into her work with a vengeance. There was a small secret part of her heart that was also worried that once B'Elanna could chose from anyone on the ship to spend time with she might no longer wish to be with Seven.  Still, she should be happy for her friend, so she forced a wide smile onto her face and entered the room trying to project the image of someone without a care in the world.</p>
<p>"I see you are up already, you must be truly anxious about the possibility of Borg enhancements in your engine room," Seven joked.</p>
<p>Wordlessly B'Elanna crossed the room and threw her arms around Seven.  "Sweetie, don't worry, nothing is going to change between us just because I'm allowed to leave my quarters.  I love you Seven, only you," she stated emphatically.</p>
<p>Taken aback Seven could only mumble, "how could you know?"</p>
<p>"Because I love you.  You think I don't the difference between a real smile and a 'my heart's breaking but I'm Borg so nobody will notice' smile.  Please try not to worry Ok.  I promise, everything is going to be fine."</p>
<p>"I love you B'Elanna Torres."</p>
<p>"I know," B'Elanna smiled wicked, "but don't think that's going to save your cute little behind if I find even a single Borg enhancement to my engines," the young Klingon teased before kissing Seven on the tip of her nose.  "Let's eat."</p>
<p>As they cleared the dishes away B'Elanna enthused about the day ahead. "I can't wait to get back to work.  The first thing I'm going to do is run a diagnostic on the plasma injectors, the engines have sounded a little different the last couple of days, maybe they need realigning." Her ability to detect problems with the engines just from the feel of the deck plates vibrating was legendary aboard Voyager.</p>
<p>Seven smiled at the young engineer's enthusiasm, but interrupted nonetheless. "The first thing you are going to do is report to sickbay for your checkup."</p>
<p>"Oh, come on, that can wait.  Tell you what, I'll stop by engineering and start the diagnostics and then swing by sickbay."</p>
<p>Seven crossed her arms and tapped her foot, the perfect picture of indulgent irritation.  She raised her ocular implant to its highest level, "the first thing you are going to do is what?"</p>
<p>"Go to sickbay for my checkup."  B'Elanna knew when she was beaten.</p>
<p>Seven insisted on a site to site transport to sickbay just in case the Doctor found anything wrong.  She needn't have worried however as the EMH ran a series of tests and pronounced B'Elanna fit to return to duty immediately.  B'Elanna thanked the Doctor effusively and turned to Seven.  She looked up into the face that had become so dear to her, and even as the Doctor was reiterating how brilliant his cure had been B'Elanna spoke, "Computer deactivate the EMH."</p>
<p>"B'Elanna what are you doing, that was terribly rude."</p>
<p>"I'll apologize later," B'Elanna said as she pulled Seven's head down to capture her lips. Seven responded instantly, clutching B'Elanna's uniform jacket and pulling her close.  The kiss deepened as tongues tangled and hands explored.   </p>
<p>The EMH shimmered back into view with a angry remark about B'Elanna's gratitude, or lack thereof, but when he caught site of the scene in front of him he merely rolled his eye and heaved a theatrical sigh saying, "Computer deactivate EMH."</p>
<p>Seven had undone B'Elanna's tunic and she was untucking her tank top, frantically seeking access to the engineer's wonderful caramel skin, moaning as finally managed to touch the Klingon's warm back.  B'Elanna let her hands run down Seven's back until she grasped the younger woman's perfectly shaped behind in her hands, gently kneading as she pulled Seven closer still.  'Kahless I want this woman in my bed,' she thought to herself even as she knew that they needed to stop right now. She slid her hands up to Seven's face, enjoying every inch of their sensuous journey up the young Borg's back and shoulders, caressing her cheeks even as she gently tried to disengage from the embrace.  She almost lost her resolve when she felt Seven nip at her lower lip, but she managed to soothe the heated embrace into a gentle hug as the two of them fought for control over hammering hearts and panting breaths. </p>
<p>Finally able to trust herself to move, B'Elanna looked up at Seven.  The young Borg's face was flushed and her hair was disheveled as her stormy blue eyes locked with B'Elanna's.  She smiled shakily, a little surprised at how easily she felt out of control around this enchanting creature.  Seven returned her smile before lowering her head so their foreheads were touching.  They stayed that way for several moments, each taking strength from the other.</p>
<p>Seven was the first to straighten up, "I suppose we should return to our duties," her voice was less certain than she had intended.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I guess we really should."  There was a moment of quiet before B'Elanna inquired, "do you want to meet for lunch in the messhall, say around 1300."</p>
<p>"Acceptable," said Seven as her legendary Borg control snapped back into place.</p>
<p>B'Elanna finished straightening up her clothes, quickly kissing Seven once more before they headed down to engineering.</p>
<p>B'Elanna began running her diagnostics of the plasma injectors before she greeted her crew, all of whom were ecstatic to see her.  They hadn't really minded working for Seven of Nine, but they all felt just a little more relaxed now that the Chief was back. She endured the good-natured ribbing about her slacking off and the happy greetings for several moments before she grabbed Seven and demanded a full report of the repairs and upgrades completed since the encounter with the Hakari.</p>
<p>It was lunchtime before they were done going over all of the information regarding repairs so they walked to the messhall together.  B'Elanna had to fight her urges to grab Seven's hand and hold it the whole way there.  Neelix was vibrating with excitement at the sight of B'Elanna back in her uniform and back in his messhall.  He grandly ushered them to a table and told them he would be right back with their lunches.  B'Elanna was a little skeptical about letting him choose her meal for her but he seemed so happy that she couldn't bring herself to say to no.</p>
<p>"Here you are, my own special recipe, Leola Root Casserole," he said with a flourish as he set two plates of vaguely yellowish goo before them.</p>
<p>"Erm, thanks Neelix."</p>
<p>It was obvious he wasn't going to go away without getting a reaction to his selection, so B'Elanna picked up her fork and took a mouthful.  It was definitely not as spicy as the Talaxian's cooking usually was, which was good, but the problem was it didn't have much taste at all.  Still, sometimes that could be a blessing with Neelix's cooking.</p>
<p>"Thanks Neelix, it's great," she smiled widely at a gratified chef.</p>
<p>"Wonderful, well, enjoy your meal," he said as he scurried back behind the counter.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was besieged by well wishers as she ate.  It seems as if everyone who came into the messhall had to come over and comment on how good it was to see her back in action.  She took it well considering she really just wanted to be alone with Seven. Even Tom Paris came up to them, having the good grace to look extremely uncomfortable, and told her he was glad to see that she was feeling better.  The truth was there wasn't a soul on board Voyager who didn't feel safer knowing the B'Elanna was back in charge of the engine room.</p>
<p>Lunch flew by all to quickly and they soon headed back to work.  Since she was finished briefing B'Elanna on the engines Seven was returning to Astrometrics.  They got into the turbolift and announced their separate decks.  The doors slid closed and Seven turned quickly spinning B'Elanna into her arms and kissing her passionately.  "I will miss you this afternoon B'Elanna Torres," she stated when they broke apart.</p>
<p>B'Elanna could only manage a nod and a slightly dazed look.  </p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon flew by as B'Elanna got reacquainted with her engines and her crew.</p>
<p>Sadly for Seven the same did not hold true for her.  She had become used to the controlled chaos of engineering, and the utter calm of Astrometrics seemed a little, dull, this afternoon.  She also missed B'Elanna terribly, but could come up with no good reason to visit the engine room.  She checked the time for the 52<sup>nd</sup> time that afternoon and tried to refocus her energy on her scans.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>&lt;Torres to Kim&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Kim here&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Can you meet me in the messhall after your shift&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;No problem, see you there&gt;</p>
<p>B'Elanna had done as much as she could on her little project, and now needed some help.  Tom Paris was the acknowledged king of holoprogramming, but there was no way in the galaxy that she was going to ask him.  Harry was almost as good and she could trust him to be happy for her, and, more importantly, to keep his mouth shut.</p>
<p>She showed him the PADD containing her work and he perused it with interest.  B'Elanna was waiting until Seven to showed up so that they could eat together so she fetched Harry's food for him while he went over what she had done so far.</p>
<p>"It looks good," he said, "and I mean the program not the food," as he eyed the unidentified meal on the tray B'Elanna brought back for him.  "I think I can help.  Tell me what you want."  B'Elanna leaned forward enthusiastically as she explained her ideas. </p>
<p>Seven came through the doors to the messhall and scanned for B'Elanna.  She felt a twinge of something when she saw B'Elanna and Harry with their heads together pouring over a PADD.  She forced herself to step into the food line as she analyzed her feelings.  She was ashamed to admit that she was jealous of Harry.  Having received her food, Seven was now at a loss as to what to do.  She desperately wanted to go sit with B'Elanna but was afraid that she might be intruding.  She stood in the middle of the messhall with her tray in her hands.  She was about to go and sit elsewhere when B'Elanna looked up and saw her.  Seven was relieved at the smile that crossed the engineer's face as she waved her over, but felt that familiar twinge as she saw the young Klingon hide the PADD that they had been working on.</p>
<p>She sat with them and they immediately began talking about ship's business and then Harry began catching B'Elanna up on all of the gossip she had missed during her enforced isolation. Seven picked at her food, for some reason she was no longer hungry.  When the meal was over they all got up to leave and Harry invited them to go to Sandrine's that evening.  B'Elanna had been about to accept when Seven made a point of declining the invitation.  B'Elanna shrugged and said that maybe they'd be there another night.  When they got onto the turbolift B'Elanna ordered it to Deck 9.  She was a little shocked when Seven spoke up, ordering the lift to Deck 2.</p>
<p>"You aren't coming back to my quarters," she asked, her confusion evident?</p>
<p>"I was unaware that I was invited."</p>
<p>"Seven, you're always invited."</p>
<p>Seven made no comment but ordered the computer to ignore her deck request.  They walked in an awkward silence to B'Elanna's quarters.</p>
<p>Once inside B'Elanna removed her uniform jacket and ordered a glass of wine from the replicator.  Seven declined her offer of a drink and stood rather awkwardly in the middle of the room.  B'Elanna crossed to the couch.  She sat down and patted the seat beside her, "aren't you going to sit down Seven?"  The younger woman sat rigidly beside her and continued to say nothing. B'Elanna put her arm around the young drone's shoulder and pulled her closer.  She felt Seven relax slightly, and lean into her embrace.  She was about to ask what the problem was when Seven cupped her chin in hand and kissed her.  The question flew out of B'Elanna's mind as she returned the kiss with a passion.</p>
<p>They gently sank down on the sofa, until Seven was lying on top of B'Elanna.  She could feel the ache of need in the pit of her stomach as she moved from kissing her mouth to ravishing her neck with kisses and bites.  B'Elanna's head was swimming as Seven consumed her neck with an almost visceral hunger.  B'Elanna reached up and freed Seven's hair, sliding her hands into it and glorying in the feel of the golden tresses.  She felt Seven's hand pull her top free from her pants and gasped as skin met skin. Seven returned to B'Elanna's mouth as her tongue began to plunder the young engineer's mouth.  She gloried in the growl that seemed to be ripped from B'Elanna's core.  She slid her knee between B'Elanna's legs and pressed down on the raging heat of the Klingon's centre.  B'Elanna was moaning now as her hands desperately tried to find access to Seven's skin through the biosuit.  She felt Seven's hand slide up her belly and cup her breast, beginning to squeeze her nipple through the thin fabric of her bra. Her mouth replaced her hand as she nuzzled B'Elanna's breast through the fabric of her top, her hand, now free slid down to tug at the zipper to B'Elanna's pants. As turned on as she was B'Elanna knew they had to stop, this wasn't right, it was too soon for both of them.  </p>
<p>She pulled back from Seven's sensual assault, moaning, "Seven, sweetheart, we, ahh, we need to stop."</p>
<p>Seven said nothing but tried to recapture B'Elanna' s lips with her own as her hands returned to the young Klingon's breasts.</p>
<p>B'Elanna twisted her head, avoiding the kiss and trying to remove Seven's hand from under her shirt.</p>
<p>"Seven, I said stop, please."</p>
<p>Seven moved to kiss B'Elanna's neck as she tried to free her hand from the restraint of the Klingon's. Her actions were getting rougher and B'Elanna began to feel angry. She pushed Seven aside and leapt to her feet.  </p>
<p>"What the hell was that about," she demanded?</p>
<p>Seven looked up at her, her expression entirely Borg.  "Lieutenant Torres, if you are not interested in pursuing this relationship with me than you could do me the courtesy of being honest.  I will not be made a fool of."</p>
<p>"What the hell are you talking about Seven?  You're the one who is acting like we just met one minute and then crawling all over me the next."  </p>
<p>"What was on the PADD you and Ensign Kim were looking at during dinner?"</p>
<p>B'Elanna's head was swimming as she tried to keep up with the twist in the conversation.  "What the hell does that have to do with you being all over me like a Targ in heat just now," she demanded?</p>
<p>"I wish to know what you and Ensign Kim were doing."</p>
<p>B'Elanna was getting really angry now and spoke without thinking&#133; "It's none of your damn business what we were doing."</p>
<p>Seven said nothing, merely stared at B'Elanna as if she were a bug under a microscope.</p>
<p>"Very well, if you are incapable of being honest with me than I shall have to be the one to terminate the relationship." She replied and was gone from the room before B'Elanna could reply</p>
<p>"What the fuck just happened," B'Elanna said out loud as she watched the doors to her quarters shut.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was furious now and she ran out of her quarters and down the hall after Seven.  She caught up with her outside the turbolift, grabbing her arm and spinning her around so they were facing.  She demanded, "do you want to explain to me what just happened in there?"</p>
<p>"I have nothing to explain, I have acted honorably, it is you who are keeping secrets and being deceitful.  You do not desire me sexually and you will not share your life with me, there is nothing more to talk about."</p>
<p>"Seven, damn it, I'm not going to have this conversation in the hallway."</p>
<p>"Then we will not have it at all."</p>
<p>B'Elanna lost it at that, she grabbed Seven's arm and proceeded to frog march her down the corridor and back to the quarters</p>
<p>"Computer seal the doors to my quarters."</p>
<p>"Seven, we are talking about this and we are talking now."</p>
<p>"Then tell me what you and Ensign Kim were discussing at dinner."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Comply."</p>
<p>"Seven it's none of your business."</p>
<p>"If you feel that way then we have nothing further to discuss. It is obvious you would rather be with Ensign Kim than me."</p>
<p>B'Elanna felt her anger peaking; Seven was standing rigidly with her hands behind her back and that infuriatingly superior look on her face. She was about to rip into Seven with a vengeance when she saw a single tear escape the drone's eye and track down her flushed face.  The logical part of B'Elanna's mind insisted she see beyond Seven's anger and remember that she had no experience with friendship let alone romantic relationships. She marshaled all of her control and spoke softly,</p>
<p>"Seven please just sit down and let's talk about this rationally."</p>
<p>She could clearly see Seven's pain and uncertainty as another tear began its journey.  Looking closely at the woman she loved B'Elanna could see that the younger women was trembling.  She took her arm and led her to the sofa, sitting her down gently and beginning to pace as she tried to find a way to get through to the now bereft-looking young woman.</p>
<p>She crossed to the couch in two quick steps, kneeling down she took Seven's hands in hers, caressing them softly she asked, "Seven, please tell me what's going on here."</p>
<p>"When I saw you in the messhall laughing and talking with Ensign Kim I felt, I believe the emotion is jealousy.  When I came to the table you ceased your activities and tried to hide the PADD you were working on.  You both exhibited rapid heart beats and an inability to meet my gaze directly, so I assumed you were hiding something of a personal nature, perhaps pertaining to our relationship or one that you and Mr. Kim were initiating."  She paused, waiting for the angry response she was certain B'Elanna was holding in.  She was surprised to feel the young Klingon squeeze her hands gently and urge, "go on Seven."</p>
<p>"I was unsure of what to do.  When you told me I was welcome to come back to your quarters I thought perhaps you were willing to give me another chance.  I thought that if I instigated a sexual encounter you might be willing to continue our relationship.  You have made it clear, however, that I was in error. I apologize for attacking you 'like a Targ in heat.' I will understand if you wish to pursue legal action in this matter." </p>
<p>B'Elanna was heartbroken at the pain and need in Seven's voice. "Seven, how can you even think that after I told you just this morning how much I loved you?"</p>
<p>"I assumed that once you were back in the larger population of the ship you realized that you could do better than a relationship with a Borg drone."</p>
<p>"Look, Seven, I love you, and I don't mind telling you that a hundred times a day if I need to, but at some point you are going to have to learn to trust that love if we are going to have a shot at making this work."</p>
<p>"I will comply."</p>
<p>B'Elanna laughed softly, "honey trust isn't something you just comply with, it is something that you build, that we will build together. I'm going to have other friendships and I hope that you are too, but you are the one I love, the one I chose to live my life with, and that isn't going to change just because I find a project to work on with someone else."</p>
<p>"So you and Ensign Kim were working on a project for the ship?" </p>
<p>"Seven, honestly, you're incorrigible, I'm not going to tell you what Harry and I were working on.  There are going to be times that we have secrets from one another.  Not about important things, but little secrets, ones that don't impact on our relationship in a negative way. Do you understand what I'm trying to say?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes Naomi Wildman tells me her secret thoughts and asks that I not reveal them to her mother.  Is this what you mean by 'little secrets.'"</p>
<p>"Exactly, you need to keep those secrets for your friend, and I have to trust that that doesn't mean that you love me any less."</p>
<p>"I believe I understand, but&#133;"</p>
<p>"What sweetie, you know you can ask me anything?"</p>
<p>"Why do you not desire me sexually?"</p>
<p>The raw need and fear in Seven's voice cut B'Elanna to the core.  She shifted up onto the couch and pulled the young drone into her arms.  "I very much desire you sexually Seven.  In fact lately I have trouble thinking about anything other than how much I want you."</p>
<p>She took the beautiful young woman's face in both her hands, gazing deeply into her eyes, "there is something we need to make very clear.  Sex is not an answer to problems in a relationship.  You can't just think that if you're feeling insecure that you can 'instigate a sexual encounter' and make the worries go away.  As you can see it usually ends up having quite the opposite effect. I don't just want to have sex with you. I want to make love with you, and I want our first time to be perfect and special and someplace wonderful."</p>
<p>"It will be perfect as long as you are there."</p>
<p>"Seven, I know that, but for our first time I want some wonderful romantic adventure that we'll always remember.  Most of all I want us to be sure that we are both ready to make love, and that we aren't doing it just because we think we should, we're feeling insecure, or we think it might bring us closer."</p>
<p>"I believe I understand.  B'Elanna I am sorry that I questioned you honour.  I will attempt to have more control in the future."</p>
<p>"Let's just promise each other that we'll talk about stuff like this when it comes up.  We can work through these things together Ok."</p>
<p>"Ok."</p>
<p>They held each other tightly until Seven stirred, "it is late and you need your sleep after your first day back at work.  I should be going."</p>
<p>"Stay with me tonight Seven&#133;please. I&#133;"</p>
<p>Seven stopped B'Elanna's words with a kiss; she stood up and led the way to the bedroom.  </p>
<p>Seven wrapped her arms around B'Elanna, holding her close, sharing the feeling of warmth and safety as they fell asleep.</p>
<p>The next few weeks seemed to fly by.  B'Elanna was busy in engineering, but was also spending every available second working with Harry to perfect her holoprogram. Because she was busy she had less time to spend with Seven than she might have liked, but they made up for it by trying to work together in engineering whenever it was possible.  They found that they fought less now than they had previously, but on several occasions they found themselves shouting at one another in disagreement over how to proceed with one problem or another.  The difference now was that eventually they calmed down and reached an equitable solution.  Sometimes they even managed to laugh at themselves later when they recalled their disagreements.  Even though great progress had been made, B'Elanna still had to keep her Klingon temper in check on several occasions when she was gripped with an intense desire to start throwing things around the engine room.</p>
<p>Seven missed the time she used to be able to spend with B'Elanna when the engineer had been confined to her quarters, and she was shocked at how often she struggled with her jealousy over B'Elanna's other friendships.  She disliked that illogical part of her that seemed to begrudge B'Elanna's finding happiness with other people.  She had learned from past mistakes, however, and when she felt that she might be getting out of control she talked it over with B'Elanna. She never ceased to be amazed at how understanding and gentle the usually volatile Klingon could be in helping her to come to grips with her emotions.  Still, after several days of little or no personal time with <b>her </b>Klingon she had come up with a plan, and was determined not to be denied. She was a woman with a mission.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was getting very frustrated.  She had been pouring over the diagnostics from the shield generators for hours.  There was a problem maintaining a stable matrix, and she was worried that the shields might fail the next time they really needed them.  She knew she was missing something, but she just couldn't seem to locate the problem.  Growling in anger she hurled the PADD she was studying at the wall of her office.  It hit the wall with a satisfying crack just a second after the door opened and Seven of Nine stepped into her office.</p>
<p>Seven observed the demise of the PADD with a wry smile, and raising her ocular implant to impossible heights asked dryly, "Lieutenant Torres, are you attempting to initiate a Klingon mating ritual with me?"</p>
<p>"Wha, huh, um no, I mean, Sorry Seven, I didn't see you come in."</p>
<p>"Indeed."</p>
<p>"What, ah, what can I do for you Seven?" B'Elanna was still flustered over Seven's reference to the Klingon mating ritual.</p>
<p>"You can agree to spend the evening with me."</p>
<p>It was on the tip of B'Elanna's tongue to decline as she had plans to meet with Harry to finalize the last details of the program, but Seven looked so hopeful that B'Elanna quickly agreed.  The program could wait another day.</p>
<p>"I will pick you up at your quarters at 1800hr.  Casual attire will be appropriate."</p>
<p>"Great, it's a date."</p>
<p>B'Elanna redoubled her efforts on the shield grid and was rewarded with success a mere half-hour before she was to be ready to go with Seven.  She logged off duty and jogged to her quarters, grabbing a shower and trying to figure out what a Borg's idea of casual attire could possibly mean.  She finally settled for black dress pants and a cream shirt.  She was just doing up the last button on her shirt when the chime to her quarters sounded.</p>
<p>"Come in."</p>
<p>Seven appeared in her quarters wearing a blue biosuit.  B'Elanna smiled to herself thinking that they would really have to come up with a wider wardrobe for Seven.</p>
<p>"You know the codes to the door Seven you don't have to knock."</p>
<p>"I thought it was appropriate given that we are embarking on an official date."</p>
<p>"Ok, then, I believe this is the part of the evening when I tell you how beautiful you look."</p>
<p>"You may proceed."  </p>
<p>"Seven of Nine, you look lovely this evening."</p>
<p>"As do you B'Elanna Torres&#133;shall we?"  Seven offered her arm to B'Elanna, who smiled at the courtly gesture before linking arms with her date.</p>
<p>"Where are we going?"</p>
<p>"It is a surprise."</p>
<p>Seven wasn't kidding it was a surprise.  Holding her arm gently Seven led B'Elanna straight to&#133;</p>
<p>"Astrometrics, our date is in astrometrics?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it was the most romantic place I could think of aboard Voyager."</p>
<p>B'Elanna was certain she could come up with about a dozen more romantic places, including Jefferies Tube 36, but Seven looked so eager that she merely smiled and said, "lead on."</p>
<p>Seven led B'Elanna through the doors and into, yup, it was the astrometrics lab all right.  There was a rather large bundle in the corner and Seven went to fetch it. When she came back she led B'Elanna up to the dais. She placed the bundle on top of the dais and pushed it off to one side.  She then turned to B'Elanna and placed her hands on her waist and lifted her up until she was sitting on the edge of the raised platform.  In one graceful movement she was sitting beside B'Elanna.  She kissed her tenderly for a moment before crawling over and unpacking the mysterious package.</p>
<p>She pulled out a large blanket and proceeded to spread it out over the dais.  The bundle also contained a number of large fluffy pillows that she propped against the back of the console.  The last item was a picnic basket, which she proceeded to unpack.  All B'Elanna could do was stare in amazement as she brought out a bottle of wine, some cheese and crackers and two stasis containers. She spread out the little feast and opened the bottle of wine; she then leaned over the console and entered in several commands.  The view screen came to life and displayed a beautiful expanse of stars that B'Elanna recognized from her home planet of Kessik IV.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was absolutely speechless.  Seven motioned her over to the blanket and B'Elanna crawled over obediently.  </p>
<p>"What is all this?"</p>
<p>"It is a picnic. I thought you might find it relaxing&#133;do you not like it?"</p>
<p>"Like it, Seven I love it.  This is absolutely perfect."</p>
<p>Seven poured the wine as B'Elanna made herself comfortable against the pillows.  She took the proffered glass and raised it to Seven, "to perfect evenings."</p>
<p>"To perfect evenings," Seven repeated as she sipped her wine.</p>
<p>"Tell me about these stars," Seven asked.</p>
<p>B'Elanna pointed out several of the constellations she recognized as Seven began to feed her small bites of bread and cheese. The feeling of being fed was incredibly sensuous and B'Elanna kissed the beautiful fingers as they brought the tender morsels to her mouth.  </p>
<p>Suddenly the scene on the viewscreen changed and B'Elanna found herself looking at a stellar nursery that Voyager had passed several years ago.  The swirling hues of colour were absolutely breathtaking as they contrasted with the utter darkness at the core of the nursery.  It was the second most beautiful sight that B'Elanna had ever seen.</p>
<p>The screen displayed one wondrous vision after another as they ate.  Seven had prepared a pasta dish she knew B'Elanna liked and for desert she had assembled a simple collection of fruits, which she also proceeded to feed to B'Elanna by hand.</p>
<p>At the end of the evening they lay together against the pillows, sipping the last of the wine as the final image shimmered onto the screen.  It was a binary star system that B'Elanna had never seen before.</p>
<p>"I do not know the names of these stars, Voyager passed them several months ago.  They are caught in one another's gravitational pull.  When I first saw them I thought it was said that they would never achieve individuality, but now I see how beautiful it is that will always be together.  They will dance together, just the two of them, fueled only by the force of their own attraction to one another, forever."</p>
<p>"I never knew you were such a poet Seven."</p>
<p>"Nor did I, until I met you.  I simply know that I wish to hold you forever, just like those stars."</p>
<p>"Forever is a very long time," B'Elanna said as she reached up to kiss her lover.</p>
<p>"Not nearly long enough Beloved," Seven whispered as their lips met.</p>
