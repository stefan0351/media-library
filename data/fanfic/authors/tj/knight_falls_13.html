<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 13 -->

<p>B'Elanna entered the ring and knelt down, picking up a handful of the soft dirt that covered the area and letting it trickle through her fingers.  She rubbed it into her hands and brushed the excess off on her tunic.  The dirt would help absorb the sweat of her palms as they fought and hopefully allow her to keep a firmer grip on her sword during the fight.  She began to look for Annika in the crowd that had gathered but then shook her head clearing it firmly of all distraction.  If she did not focus on the task at hand, the idea of whether or not she and Annika would find a way to be together would be immaterial.  </p>
<p>She looked across the ring to where Charles Kotay stood, one foot resting on the bottom rung of the fence that surrounded the arena.  He was leaning on the fence and chatting with his friends, looking for all the world like a man about to dance with a Lady, not a man about to dance with death.  B'Elanna was nervous and her heart was pounding but she was confident in her skills as a warrior.  Kotay was bigger and had more battle experience, but B'Elanna was counting on her strength, speed and conditioning to see her through the test to come.  She filled her lungs with air, feeling her focus narrow with every passing second--she drew her sword from its sheath.  </p>
<p>Hearing the ring of metal on metal as Beyla's sword cleared the scabbard, Kotay turned around and picked up the shield he had opted to use, drawing his sword he came to the centre of the ring. </p>
<p>"Are you ready boy?" He asked with disdain in his voice.</p>
<p>"Are you old man?" Beyla sneered in return.</p>
<p>"En garde," Kotay cried as he stepped back and assumed the ready position.</p>
<p>B'Elanna began to circle clockwise around the ring?she held her sword in one hand, moving her arm in a figure of eight in front of her, twisting her wrist the sword describing a mesmerizing dance in the air.  She watched Kotay and waited for him to make the opening gambit.  When it came it was with a speed and strength that B'Elanna had never experienced before.  She was hard-pressed to repel his thrusts and it was only by luck and a quick retreat that she managed to keep her feet and remain unharmed.  For the first time since she had begun her new life she felt real fear.  This was no longer a game?should Kotay overpower her he would kill her.  She felt her gorge rise and fought to maintain control of herself.  Unbidden, an image of Annika came to her mind's eye and she felt herself begin to calm down--her love for the younger woman giving her courage.</p>
<p>Once again they circled one another and this time it was B'Elanna who attacked.  Kotay repelled her every thrust and when she managed to outmaneuver his sword arm his shield was there to turn her blade aside.  They had been fighting for about 10 minutes but B'Elanna had yet to find a weakness in his style.  She found that Kotay was firmly in charge of the duel?he was moving her about the sword ring at will and B'Elanna could not seem to bring the fight onto her own terms.  Her only hope was the sweat she saw pouring down Kotay's face and the fact that his breathing was becoming laboured.  If nothing else she appeared to be in superiour shape to the Lord and she hoped she might eventually wear him down until he made an error on which she could capitalize.  She was eternally grateful that he had chosen to carry a shield, for although it made it harder for her to strike him it also encumbered him and made it harder for him to move quickly enough to get inside her defenses.  </p>
<p>Kotay rushed at her again, and again she fell back in the face of his ferocious attack.  It was then that B'Elanna stumbled over her own feet in her haste to retreat from the viscous assault.  She went down hard on her back and looked up to see Kotay thrusting his sword down toward her chest with a vicious snarl.  With a desperate sweep of her sword she pushed aside his thrust and the tip of his sword buried itself deeply into the ground beside her.  Seeing the look of surprise on Kotay's face that she had actually survived his attack, she seized the moment and rolled her body to the side, rolling over the sword, the weight of her body tearing the hilt from Kotay's hand and flattening the weapon to the ground.  She leapt to her feet and as Kotay bent to retrieve his weapon she thrust the tip of her sword to his throat.  She forced his head slowly upward with the tip of her sword, a small trickle of blood the only indication that he resisted her imperative.  When he stood upright, her sword at his throat, she locked eyes with him seeing there only anger and no fear of his fate at all.  </p>
<p>With one flick of her wrist it would be ended, Kotay was powerless to stop her now, but honour stayed her hand.  Even though she had disarmed him fairly she could not bring herself to cut the throat of am unarmed man.  With a slight bow she stepped back and indicated to the Lord that he should pick up his weapon.</p>
<p>Kotay bent down to retrieve his sword. 'Foolish boy,' he thought to himself.  'Honour is a luxury for those that play at war in the tournaments. It has no place in true battle.  You won't live to regret your mistake.' He grasped the hilt of his sword and picked it up quickly, flicking it up toward B'Elanna, throwing all of the sand that had gathered on its blade into her eyes, using his shield to partially hide his actions from the crowd.  Quickly he attacked once more.</p>
<p>B'Elanna saw Kotay's movement but didn't understand what it meant until it was too late.  The debris blinded her and it took all of her self-discipline to not simply drop her sword and rub at her eyes with her hands.  Instead she raised her weapon and squinted hard to make out the shape of her enemy as he leapt to the attack.  Using all of her senses she listened for the sound of his sword as it cut through the air and in this manner she defended herself clumsily while she retreated around the ring.  She fought desperately, trying to gain enough time so that the tears streaming down her cheeks might clear the dirt from her eyes. She heard his blade hissing through the air and parried quickly, his blow sliding clear of her neck and only nicking her free hand as it glanced off to the side.  She regained her balance to wait for the next blow, blinking furiously as her world slowly came back into focus.  </p>
<p>Kotay pressed his advantage furiously and was angered to see that it was not working.  Somehow the boy was managing to detect his blows even though he was blinded.  The older Lord was tiring now and still he pressed--raining blows on the younger man in hopes of slipping his blade between Beyla's desperate defenses.</p>
<p>Finally her eyes cleared and now B'Elanna let her anger flow as she for the first time took the fight in the direction she chose.  She thrust furiously as she pushed Kotay back toward the fence of the sword ring.  She could tell he was growing winded and was relying more and more on his shield to protect him.  With a wild cry she used two hands in a ferocious overhand blow that hewed the great buckler in two, and it was all Kotay could do to parry her blows as he discarded the shattered pieces of his shield.  In his desperation he struck out with his fist and caught B'Elanna firmly across the mouth, and she tasted the copper of her own blood.  Her surprise at the blow gave Kotay the time he needed to free his arm and they once again circled one another slowly around the ring.</p>
<p>B'Elanna knew she needed to end this before Kotay's experience and strength got the better of her.  She never took her eyes off of his as she spat the blood from her mouth and rushed headlong into the battle once again.  This time Kotay could barely keep up with the blur of blows rained down on him by B'Elanna.  He was wholly on the defensive now and he stumbled badly but managed to regain his balance before B'Elanna could press her advantage.  Finally she managed to knock his sword to the side with a powerful sweep of her weapon and before he could recover she thrust her sword deeply into his chest.  The power and momentum of her blow carried them both across the ring until Kotay's body slammed hard into the fence.</p>
<p>B'Elanna looked deeply into his eyes as the life slowly drained from his body.  Gone was the anger, replaced with puzzlement, as if he couldn't quite remember how he had come to be there.  His hands clumsily grasped at the blade of her sword, vainly trying to remove it from his body.  Finally his arms fell nerveless to his sides and B'Elanna stepped aside as he slumped to his knees and then sideways onto the ground.  She kept hold of her sword and as he fell it pulled clear of his body, slick with his blood.  She stood for a moment, regarding the Lord as he lay in death, and then she turned to face the gallery, raising her sword again she thundered,</p>
<p>"Are there any others who would challenge me in this matter?"  </p>
<p>Kotay's friends cast their eyes downward and did not answer.  If he had appointed a second it appeared that man had no desire to enter the ring with Beyla.  Satisfied that she was safe B'Elanna turned to look for Annika.  </p>
<p>She spotted the younger woman just as she pulled free from Tom's arms and began to run toward the ring in a decidedly unLadylike fashion.  Sword still in hand, B'Elanna put her free hand on the top rail of the sword ring fence and cleared it in one graceful leap.  She pushed through the crowd and grabbed Annika around the waist as they finally reached one another, picking her up in one arm and swinging her around in a circle before setting her back on her feet.  Annika pulled B'Elanna's face to hers and they kissed passionately; there was a murmur of approval from the crowd. Even though Kotay had been the injured party, Beyla had won the duel most honourably and many of the people present knew of the love Annika and Beyla shared and were happy to see the young couple together.  Breaking the kiss, Annika kept B'Elanna's face in her hands.</p>
<p>"I feared I might lose you my Lord."</p>
<p>"Never Annika, never?when anger opposes love, love will always triumph."</p>
<p>Annika put her head on Beyla's shoulder and allowed the strong arms of her love to hold her close.  She didn't care that her knight was covered in dirt, sweat and blood, all that mattered to her was the sense of belonging?of the home she found in the arms of her Lord.  They stood thus for some time until B'Elanna realized that they were the centre of attention.</p>
<p>"We should go now Lady Hansart.  Your father should hear of these events from us and not through the gossip of strangers."  </p>
<p>In truth B'Elanna was not looking forward to facing Lord Hansart with the news that the Lord he had picked out to marry his daughter had first been shamed by Annika's actions and then killed by her own hand.  She had no idea what Lord Hansart would do when he heard this news, but there was no way that B'Elanna was going to let Annika face her father alone.  She squared her shoulders and took Annika's hand as they turned to walk to the inn where the Hansart's were staying.</p>
<p>When the group reached the inn they were greeted by the angry figure of Lord Hansart as he paced back and forth in the public hall.  The word that Annika had been caught by Kotay as she kissed Beyla had reached him an hour ago and he had been waiting at first worriedly and later angrily for the return of his daughter so that he might find out the fate of his bargain with the Lord.  Kotay would be within his rights to refuse to marry Annika now and if that happened Annika's disgrace would be complete and any hope of finding a suitable husband in England would vanish.  He had taken it as a bad sign that over an hour had passed with no further word about the incident.  He was decidedly unhappy to see his daughter appear at the inn in the company of a battered and bloodied Lord Beyla?obviously the worst had happened.</p>
<p>"Annika," he hissed as they entered the room, his anger at the situation overriding his concern for his daughter.  "What do you have to say for yourself.  I never expected such wanton behaviour from my own daughter.  I thought I raised you to be a lady and not to act the whore for the first young man who comes sniffing around."</p>
<p>Annika hung her head in shame, cowed by her father's angry words.  B'Elanna, however, was not in the least intimidated.</p>
<p>"Have a care Lord Hansart," B'Elanna growled, her hand going to the hilt of her sword.  "You are Annika's father and as such I owe you my respect, but I will tolerate no such disparagement of my Lady?not even from you."</p>
<p>Lord Hansart stepped back in fear at B'Elanna's words, and when he spoke again it was with greater restraint and in a lower tone of voice.  Still his fury was evident in every crisply enunciated word that fell from his lips.</p>
<p>"I want an explanation."</p>
<p>Annika, in halting tones, began to tell the story of what happened.  When she came to the part about the challenge B'Elanna took over the tale and finished by telling of Lord Kotay's death at her hands.  Lord Hansart was devastated by the news.  There was no hope now of finding a husband for Annika in England, all of his hopes were dashed.  It was as if the life went out of him and he seemed somehow older and smaller.</p>
<p>"Come Annika, get away from Lord Beyla, the two of you have done quite enough damage as it is.  I hope you realize that you have ruined your father.  There is no chance for us in England now.  We will return to France immediately and hope that we can find some suitable man who will not yet have heard of your disgrace."</p>
<p>He grabbed her by the arm and began to pull her to toward the stairs leading up to their rooms.  There were tears in Annika's eyes but for the first time there was steel in her voice when she spoke to her father.</p>
<p>"No!" She cried and pulled her arm away from her father's grasp.  "I will not be returning to France with you father.  My place is here, with Lord Beyla.  I love him father, and that is all that matters to me.  I care nothing for money, power or land, and I am truly sorry that I will not be able to fulfil your dreams of achieving these things, but I will not be bartered for goods, not by you, not by anyone."</p>
<p>It was perhaps the longest speech Annika had ever made to her father, and certainly the most forceful.  Lord Hansart simply stood there staring at this young woman he no longer knew.  He loved his daughter in his own way and hated to see her throw her life away on a young upstart with no prospects, but his fury at what he saw as the ultimate betrayal was more potent than his love in this moment.</p>
<p>"Then stay with your vagabond knight.  It is well that love is all you care for Annika for it seems that love is all you will have.  When you finally realize that you can't eat or drink love, when you finally tire of living in tents and sleeping on the ground remember this day."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry father, I truly am," Annika said as she started up the stairs to pack her belongings.  She was impeded in her progress by the hand of her father.</p>
<p>"If you leave with him you leave with nothing but the clothes on your back.  Everything else belongs to me.  Now be gone both of you?from this moment on I have no daughter," he proclaimed in a stentorian voice.</p>
<p>Annika couldn't believe that her father could be so cruel.  She turned to leave only to be stopped again by her father's voice.</p>
<p>"And just where do you think you're going?"  </p>
<p>She turned around to see what was meant by that statement and saw that her father had addressed that question to Tom and Katherine who had been about to leave with her and Lord Beyla.</p>
<p>"You are indentured to me young lady and it will be several years until you are free to leave my employ."</p>
<p>Katherine's heart fell to her feet at Lord Hansart's pronouncement.  It had never occurred to her that she might be separated from Annika.</p>
<p>"Surely we can come to some agreement Lord Hansart," B'Elanna spoke up.</p>
<p>"I am a business man not a monster," Lord Hansart agreed.  To prove his point he charged twice what Katherine's indenture was worth, but B'Elanna paid it gladly, her reward being the smiles of Annika and Kate when they learned they were not to be separated after all.</p>
<p>"And you Thomas?" Lord Hansart demanded.</p>
<p>"I believe I will be seeking employment elsewhere my Lord," Tom replied turning to leave with his friends.</p>
<p>Lord Hansart turned and stomped up the stairs in anger, brushing past his wife, who had overheard everything, without so much as a word.</p>
<p>Annika took B'Elanna's arm and the group went out from the relative gloom of the interior of the inn to the bright sunlight of the afternoon.  They were all silent as they walked each of them lost in thought over the events of the day, each pondering what the future might hold for them.</p>
