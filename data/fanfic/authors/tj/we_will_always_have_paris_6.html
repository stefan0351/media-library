<!-- We'll Always Have Paris \ Chapter 6 -->

<p>They would be arriving in the Kintari system late this night, so the morning meeting was largely concerned with finalizing lists of materials and repairs.  The Captain had already been in contact with the Space Dock outside of Kintari and they would be docking just before midnight.  Arrangements had been made for supplies to begin to be delivered in the morning, and for repair crews to have access to all of the space dock's systems in order to begin repairs.  B'Elanna had already spoken to the Space Dock's Chief engineer and was looking forward to working with the jovial older man on repairs to the ship.</p>

<p>She and Seven had not had a chance to speak yet this morning, but they decided to have breakfast together with Kate after the meeting.  Once they were seated they again found themselves with little to say, but with Kate present they were able to compensate by talking to her.  Finally B'Elanna brought up the shield modifications they had been working on and they were able to have a normal conversation at last.</p>

<p>Seven was going to be working in engineering for the rest of the day helping B'Elanna oversee the last of the system's analysis before they docked at Kintari.  B'Elanna wanted to know exactly where they stood on outstanding repairs and upgrades so she wouldn't waste of second of time once they docked.</p>

<p>Gradually as they worked they got back the easy feeling that had been between them for weeks now.  It was a relief to not have to guard against catching one another's eyes unexpectedly or accidental touches that caused hearts to race and concentration to suffer.  They finished up the duty rosters and realigned the shield emitters just in case anything unexpected came up once they entered Kintari space.  They were reasonably confident they would be fine, but it never hurt to be certain.  Once that was finished they left for the bridge to be able to watch Voyager come into space dock.</p>

<p>The Kintari homeworld was on screen when they arrived on the bridge.  It seemed to be fairly similar to earth in that it was green and blue, although it was a little smaller than their home planet.  The space dock was indeed an impressive site; Tom hadn't exaggerated its similarities to Utopia Planetia.  The space surrounding it was filled with ships of all descriptions and Voyager had to file a flight plan before entering Kintari space to avoid colliding with the numerous ships that had business in this bustling space port.  Even with the flight plan Tom had his hands full keeping Voyager out of harm's way as they approached the dock.</p>

<p>&lt;Federation vessel this is the Dentaka Prime repair facility. Please make your heading 157 mark 2 and proceed to docking station 23&gt;</p>

<p>"Acknowledged," replied Lieutenant Paris he set the required course.</p>

<p>Voyager was moving in slowly, while Paris continued to make hundreds of tiny course corrections.  Finally they were in position and there was a collective sigh of relief as they felt the docking clamps engage.</p>

<p>&lt;Docking Clamps engaged.  Welcome to Dentaka Prime Voyager. Have a good night. &gt;</p>

<p>Tom shut down the engines and turned to face the rest of the bridge complement.</p>

<p>"Well done everyone," said Captain Janeway.  "I suggest we all get a good night's sleep and get ready for the morning.  Dismissed."</p>

<p>The bridge crew slowly departed as a skeleton crew drawn from the Gamma shift took over watch on the bridge for the evening.</p>

<p>B'Elanna and Seven found themselves in the same turbo lift; B'Elanna ordered it to the messhall, as she needed to retrieve her daughter.  Seven hesitated for a moment and then chiding herself for her cowardice spoke up,</p>

<p>"B'Elanna, I was wondering if&#133;" her voice trailed off as she seemed unable to put her wishes into words.</p>

<p>"Do you want to stay with us tonight Seven?"  B'Elanna asked at last, letting the young drone off the hook.</p>

<p>"Yes, I, thank you."</p>

<p>Kate was asleep already when they picked her up, so it was a simple matter to simply put the infant in her own crib.  She snuggled under her covers never once waking up.  B'Elanna and Seven watched her for several moments before they returned to the living room.</p>

<p>B'Elanna replicated a drink of scotch from the replicator, Seven had declined her offer of a drink, and sat on the couch.</p>

<p>"I think I'm just a little to wound up to sleep just now.  I hope this is Ok Seven.  I can always go into my room if you want to sleep."</p>

<p>"I believe I am 'wound up' as well B'Elanna, please stay," the young drone replied.</p>

<p>They sat in comfortable silence while B'Elanna nursed her drink.  She couldn't stop her mind from wandering over the events of the past few days.  The truth was that she enjoyed Seven's company.  She had never had a friendship this intense before.  She wondered if anything more was possible with the young drone, but dismissed the thought.  She was relatively certain that Seven wouldn't reject her physical advances, but she wasn't willing to risk what they had for the sake of sex.  She had a sense of family when Seven was around and she wasn't about to screw that up.  She knew from experience that sex was highly overrated, and she knew that she didn't require it in her life.  She decided to concentrate on raising Kate and maintaining her friendship with Seven and leave it at that.  She had been very happy over the past few weeks since the emotion inhibitor had been removed and the young drone had become her friend; she could live with happy.  Kahless knew she'd had very little of it in her life.</p>

<p>Her drink finished, she recycled the glass and helped Seven to make up the bed.  Wishing her friend a good night she went to her own room to sleep.</p>

<p>Her alarm went off early the next day and she rushed to get Kate ready to be taken to Neelix before she reported to the Dentaka Prime Chief Engineer's office.  Kate seemed to sense her urgency and was being terribly difficult.  She was crying and refusing to eat, ignoring her mother's desperate pleas.  Seven woke up upon hearing the noise and wandered into B'Elanna's bedroom to see a very tense Klingon still in her pajama's trying to bathe a squirming, squalling infant.</p>

<p>"B'Elanna you're going to be late for your meeting.  Please allow me to take care of Kate this morning.  I will see to it that she gets to the messhall all right."</p>

<p>B'Elanna hesitated only a second.  "Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my duties are less pressing this morning.  I will join you on Dentaka Prime after I drop Kate off."  She said as she urged the young engineer toward the sonic shower.</p>

<p>B'Elanna raced through her shower and was dressed and headed out the door when she heard Seven call out to her,</p>

<p>"You have not had breakfast yet B'Elanna."</p>

<p>"No time, if I leave now I'll just make the meeting."</p>

<p>"Fine then you can eat this on your way to the meeting," said Seven as she handed a fried egg sandwich she had replicated for just this reason to B'Elanna.</p>

<p>"Thanks Seven, what would I do without you."  B'Elanna took the sandwich and kissed her daughter on the forehead, without thinking she kissed Seven on the cheek before she hurried from the room.</p>

<p>She was halfway down the corridor with her mouth full of sandwich before she realized what she'd done.  'Oh well, I'm sure Seven thought nothing of it,' she convinced herself.  'I mean it was only a peck on the cheek, friend's do that all the time don't they?'</p>

<p>Seven meanwhile was standing stock still, seemingly rooted in place while she replayed again and again the feeling of B'Elanna's full lips pressing briefly against her cheek.  It was only Kate's squirming that brought her back to reality.  She marshaled her thoughts and quickly began to prepare both herself and the child for the day ahead.</p>

<p>B'Elanna made it to the meeting on time, just!  She knocked on the door of the Chief Engineer's office and was greeted with a booming voice telling her to come in.</p>

<p>The Chief Engineer of Dentaka Prime repair station was over 6 feet tall and he towered over the Voyager's diminutive chief.  She took the proffered hand and was grateful for her Klingon physiology as she felt it crushed in the grasp of the older man.  He was humanoid, looking very normal except for the gill-like growths along his neck.  His hair was graying, but he seemed very vital.</p>

<p>"Good morning Lieutenant Torres.  I'm happy to meet you in person at last," he was pumping her arm furiously as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Good morning Chief Dartak, I'm pleased to be finally meeting you as well."</p>

<p>Pleasantries over they sat down and immediately got to work.  B'Elanna outlined her plans for the repairs and her needs as far as materials went.  She was pleased to note that Dartak had anticipated many of her needs and that much of the material was already on hand.  Her crew was required to attend a safety course on the station's systems, which they were currently attending, and once that was finished she was pleased to note that they would be able to get right to work.</p>

<p>Dartak was interested in B'Elanna's knowledge surrounding shield technology as they had been having problems maintaining a stabile matrix on such a large station.  She took his schematics and promised to go over them.  In turn Dartak assigned several of his crew to work with B'Elanna and her teams on the repairs.  All told, things couldn't have gone better for either one of them.</p>

<p>Once their meeting was over B'Elanna hurried to the safety meeting. She took a seat beside Seven as she listened to the last of the lectures on fire suppression systems on the station as well as protocol for the space walks that would be required for some of the more delicate work on the nacelles.</p>

<p>A week went by so quickly it hardly seemed as though a day had passed.  Everyone on board the ship was working full out to get the repairs finished.  B'Elanna and Seven spent most evenings together in the Klingon's quarters; they were going over plans to upgrade the shields around Dartak's station.  Once the repairs to Voyager were finished they planned to assist Dartak in making the upgrades to the docking station as a partial payment for the materials and assistance.</p>

<p>Over the course of the week B'Elanna had become very found of the older Kintarian.  He was a confirmed bachelor, but sometimes as they worked together he imagined that if he ever had a child she would have been a lot like B'Elanna.  He had heard that Janeway was considering shore leave for her crew after the repairs were completed and so at the end of the week he told B'Elanna about his sister's ocean-side resort.  He had spoken to his sister, who was notoriously softhearted, and she had agreed to allow the Voyager crew to occupy as many cabins as they wished for a week at minimal cost.  B'Elanna was thrilled when Dartak told her of his sister's decision and quickly informed Janeway over the comm of the offer.  Janeway agreed to visit the resort with a security team and inform them of her decision as soon as possible.</p>

<p>After touring the resort Janeway had to agree it looked perfect for their purposes.  There were more than enough cabins for the crew and the view of the ocean and mountains was breathtaking.  She informed the crew and assigned Neelix to gather all the requests for cabins together and make the arrangements through Dartak's sister Illiria.</p>

<p>B'Elanna was looking forward to shore leave.  She was thoroughly exhausted from the pace she had been maintaining over the past month or so.  She was also looking forward to spending lots of time with Kate.  It seemed like her daughter grew a little more everyday and B'Elanna didn't want to miss any more of her childhood than was necessary.  She caught up with Neelix in the messhall and asked him to make a reservation for herself and Kate.  She was walking away when a thought crossed her mind.  She went back to the Talaxian and inquired as to whether or not Seven had made arrangements for her shore leave.  When Neelix told her that Seven had made no effort to secure a cabin, B'Elanna asked to change her reservation to a three-bedroom house, hoping that Seven would agree to vacation with her and Kate.</p>

<p>That night over dinner she broached the subject with Seven,</p>

<p>"So Seven, Neelix tells me that you haven't bothered to arrange shore leave for yourself.  Aren't you planning on taking any time off?"</p>

<p>"I do not require a vacation at this time.  I thought I would upgrade my filing system in Astrometrics and proceed with sensor sweeps of the next areas of space we will be encountering."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see."</p>

<p>"You do not approve of my plan," Seven inquired.</p>

<p>"Nno, its just, well, I thought maybe you'd like to spend the week with Kate and I.  I was kind of hoping you would anyway, but if you really don't want to I understand."  B'Elanna tried very hard to keep the disappointment out of her voice.</p>

<p>"I did not realize that you wished for my company B'Elanna.  If you truly want me to I would be happy to take shore leave with you and Kate."</p>

<p>"I do Seven.  I think it'll be fun.  To be honest I already booked a three bedroom cabin on the off chance you said yes," B'Elanna finished sheepishly.</p>

<p>"You seem awfully sure of yourself Lieutenant Torres," Seven teased.</p>

<p>"Actually I'm just awfully sure you couldn't turn down a chance to spend a week with my daughter," B'Elanna laughed.</p>

<p>"Indeed," Seven raised her implant at B'Elanna's attempt to distract her from her teasing.</p>

<p>"Good, it's settled then. We leave in three days after we finish the upgrades to Dartak's shield emitters."</p>

<p>"Very well, I am looking forward to our vacation."</p>

<p>The last three days were hectic but fun as B'Elanna and Seven worked closely with Dartak and his crew making the shield upgrades to the station.  Dartak enjoyed getting to know Seven; he appreciated her brilliance and focus on the task at hand, and he noticed how well she seemed to suit B'Elanna's style of working.  Even though their styles were completely opposite and they often argued vehemently over the proper way to do things, they always seemed to find a compromise, usually a perfect combination of both of their ideas.  He knew that they spent almost every night together in B'Elanna's quarters; he sensed the growing attraction between the two young women. Sadly he also sensed that neither one of them seemed to be willing to make the first move nor did they seem inclined to open up to the other about how they were feeling.  He tried hinting around both of them, seeing if he could get one or the other to take the bait, but to no avail.  By the end of the three days he had to admit defeat in his amateur attempts at matchmaking.</p>

<p>The work was finally done and Dartak had invited both B'Elanna and Seven to his house for dinner.  They passed a pleasant evening telling stories and eating the delicious food that the older man had prepared.  He was going to miss having such lively company when they were gone.  To his delight both B'Elanna and Seven had insisted that he visit them at his sister's while they were on leave.  He had found out that B'Elanna was an avid rock climber and he had promised to show her some of his favourite climbs in the mountains near the resort.  When the evening was finally over he hugged them both tightly and promised to see them in a few days.  He watched sadly as they shimmered out of existance when the transporter chief brought them back to Voyager.  He shook his head at the two of them, and went to make a call to his sister.</p>


<p>Seven spent the night before their vacation was to start regenerating so she wouldn't have to worry about coming back to the ship for the week that they were away.  The doctor assured her that if she slept and ate properly she should be able to go as long as 10 days with no problem.  She had approached both the doctor and Harry Kim about the proper procedure for packing for a vacation.  She got vastly different answers from both of them and in the end decided to simply bring everything she thought they might need for their planned activities over the course of the week.</p>

<p>She met B'Elanna outside the transporter room where they joined the line of people waiting to beam down to the surface.  B'Elanna raised an eyebrow at the amount of gear Seven seemed to have with her, but upon looking down at the size of own pile she wisely decided to keep her mouth shut.  Once they were on the transporter pad B'Elanna gave the coordinates of their cabin and they were whisked away to the planet's surface.</p>

<p>They materialized in the living room of the house that B'Elanna had rented and looked around curiously.  There were many windows facing the beach that ran along the front of the house, and a large deck with several comfortable looking chairs.  The kitchen was large and airy, and B'Elanna stored the food she had brought for Kate and themselves in the fridge.  The living room was quite large as well, and had a fireplace and several small couches and chairs.  They went to investigate the bedrooms and were surprised to find only two doors opening off the short hallway.  The first door led to a bathroom and the second led to a large bedroom with an enormous bed.</p>

<p>"I don't understand," B'Elanna said.  "There should be three bedrooms.  I distinctly asked for a three- bedroom house.  There must be some mistake."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we should call Illiria and see what the problem is," Seven suggested.</p>

<p>"Good idea, the comm is in the living room I think."</p>

<p>They made the call only to be informed that when Illiria received the paperwork the request had been for a single bedroom.  When they asked if any other cabins were available the gray-haired Kintarian looked amused for a moment before informing them that the resort was all booked up for the week.  They thanked her for her time and ended the call.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should return to the ship.  That way you and Kate can enjoy your vacation.  I could beam down for a visit perhaps," Seven said sadly.</p>

<p>"No, we'll find a way to work this out Seven, you're not going anywhere."</p>

<p>"None of the couches seem suitable for sleeping B'Elanna," Seven observed.</p>

<p>"Well, we can put Kate's crib in the living room and you and I will just have to share the bedroom.  That's the biggest bed I've ever seen.  I'm sure we'll manage,"  B'Elanna barely managed to get out the last words as the thought of sharing a bed with Seven engulfed her mind. 'Come on Torres, grow up, you're just friends, and you can do this no problem,' she chided herself firmly.</p>

<p>They set up Kate's crib and put away the bulk of their gear before changing into swimsuits and heading out to the beach.  The sun was warm on their skin and once they had set up an umbrella to allow Kate to play in the sand without getting burned they relaxed on the oversized towels they had brought with them.  Seven was helping Kate construct a rather ambitious sandcastle, while B'Elanna read a holonovel she had brought with her from Voyager.  She couldn't remember the last time she had felt this relaxed.  She made herself more comfortable as she read and gradually she drifted off to sleep.  She awoke with a start at the feeling of water dripping on her face, and opened her eyes to see a dripping wet Tom Paris standing over her.</p>

<p>"Are you just going to sleep away this vacation Torres?" He inquired.</p>

<p>"Huh, what, no&#133;I guess I just fell asleep while I was reading," she stammered.</p>

<p>"Well, I just thought I'd take Kate for an hour or so if that's ok with you?" He asked.</p>

<p>"Sure, Tom, go ahead, just make sure she's back in time for dinner.  I want to make sure she gets settled ok on her first night off the ship."</p>

<p>"No problem."  He picked up his daughter from where she was still engrossed in the sandcastle she and Seven were building and loped off down the beach with his daughter laughing in his arms.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know about you, but I'm going swimming," B'Elanna announced, standing and stretching.</p>

<p>She peeled off her tee shirt and shorts to reveal a black one-piece bathing suit that Seven couldn't seem to stop staring at.  The young drone stood up and removed her own clothes exhibiting a blue one-piece.  B'Elanna felt the colour rising in her face and so grabbed her towel and jogged off toward the water before she said or did something stupid.  The water was cool and once she plunged beneath the waves she felt more in control of herself.  She swam strongly away from shore for quite a distance before she stopped and began to tread water until Seven caught up with her.  They floated on their backs, relaxing in the warmth of the sun for several minutes before they began to swim slowly back to shore.</p>

<p>A rather large group of the Voyager crew was playing a version of water polo in the water just off the sand ledge that ran the length of this part of the beach and both B'Elanna and Seven joined in the game.  They were playing on opposite sides with B'Elanna attacking for her team and Seven defending for her own.  B'Elanna was the stronger swimmer but Seven's analytical mind allowed her to anticipate the young Klingon's moves and she was able to defend admirably against B'Elanna's attempts to score.  In the dying moments of the game B'Elanna received a long pass from Harry and broke free of the defenders to move in on Seven's goal.  Only the young drone stood between her and the winning goal and B'Elanna was determined to triumph.  She swam swiftly with two hands, keeping the ball between her arms as she moved, allowing Seven to close in to a few feet and commit to attempting to take the ball away before she grabbed it in one hand and moved swiftly to one side.  She felt Seven's arms encircle her body from behind just as she fired the shot, scoring to win the game.  Seven pulled her under the water and as they sank she felt the young drone's hands slide down her body, brushing against her breasts as the younger woman released her and swam back to the surface. B'Elanna allowed her body to sink further in the water for a few seconds as she attempted to regain her senses, which were reeling from Seven's accidental touch. Finally she ran out of air and swam back to the surface to receive the congratulations of her team.  She allowed herself to be swept up in the moment and began to tease Seven about being unable to stop her from scoring and soon she felt comfortable in the younger woman's presence again.</p>

<p>They made their way back to their belongings and packed up as Tom returned Kate to them.  The sun was low in the sky and they made dinner in the house and sat on the deck watching the sunset as they ate.  It was a lovely evening.  They had opened a bottle of wine with dinner and once they put Kate down to sleep they finished the bottle on the deck, enjoying the cool fresh breeze and the sight of millions of stars appearing in the moonless sky.  Finally, exhausted from the day, they got ready for bed.  They showered and changed in the bathroom before coming into the bedroom.  They both slept in tank tops and boxer shorts so they felt at least partially dressed as they climbed into opposite sides of the huge bed.  They lay there in awkward silence for several minutes before wishing one another a good night.  Both of them tossed and turned for at least a half-hour despite their exhaustion before falling asleep.</p>


<p>The first thing B'Elanna noticed was that Kate was crying in the living room, the second thing she noticed was the warm body draped over her from behind.  Seven must have sought her out in the night.  She lay still for a moment, just enjoying the feeling of being held.  She was about to get up and go to her daughter when she felt Seven move away and get out of bed, heading for the living room.  She checked the chronometer beside the bed, 2:00am, Kate was like clockwork.  She got out of bed and went to the kitchen to prepare her daughter's bottle.</p>

<p>Seven came into view soothing Kate quietly, "You didn't need to get up B'Elanna, I can take care of this."</p>

<p>"S'Ok, I'm up."</p>

<p>Seven sat on the small couch and snuggled Kate while she waited.  When the bottle was the proper temperature B'Elanna brought it to Seven and knelt at her side, kissing her daughter's forehead as she began to feed.  Once the meal was underway, B'Elanna curled up on the floor and rested her head on Seven's knee.  She played with her daughter's toes while Kate hungrily devoured her meal.  Once finished, Seven hoisted the infant onto her shoulder, gently patting her back until she heard the child's rather loud belch.</p>

<p>"That's my little Princess," B'Elanna chuckled.</p>

<p>"Yes, she does remind of someone I know&#133;now who could that be&#133;" Seven teased back.</p>

<p>Seven continued to rub Kate's back gently until the infant was asleep once more and then she stood and carried her to the crib, laying her down gently.  B'Elanna watched as Seven smoothed the covers over her daughter, and as they stood together watching the child settle into her bed she lay her head on Seven's shoulder, and slowly wound her arm about her waist.  After a moment's hesitation Seven placed her arm over B'Elanna's shoulders, and the two of them watched Kate sleep for some time.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I wish she was your daughter," B'Elanna's voice was quiet, "then Tom could be the older brother, or the indulgent uncle who spoils her rotten, and I wouldn't have to worry&#133;" she let her voice trail off.</p>

<p>"I too sometimes imagine that she is my daughter," Seven spoke softly.</p>

<p>"Seven, if something ever happens to me," B'Elanna began.</p>

<p>"No, don't," Seven interrupted.</p>

<p>"I'm serious Seven, Tom will always be her father, but we both know that he can't really look after her alone.  He knows it too.  I'd feel better knowing that you would be there to take care of her."</p>

<p>"I will never allow your daughter to be harmed."  Seven's voice was quiet, but B'Elanna knew that she need never doubt the steel behind the words.</p>

<p>After a few more minutes of watching Kate sleep like an angel they made their way back to the bedroom.  They lay down on opposite sides of the bed, and a rather awkward silence ensued.  B'Elanna knew she was never going to be able to sleep like this, so she slid over and spooned herself into Seven's body. "Is this okay," she asked shyly.</p>

<p>"It is, acceptable," Seven answered, snuggling back into the embrace.  They were asleep in minutes.</p>

<p>The next morning B'Elanna awoke with her head on Seven's shoulder and felt the young drone's arms holding her gently.  She lay listening to her breathing, until it changed and she knew Seven was awake.</p>

<p>"Good morning Seven," B'Elanna was feeling a little awkward waking up like this, but was determined to get over it. "Did you sleep okay?"</p>

<p>Seven murmured affirmatively, seeming content to simply lie there in one another's arms.  It had been so long for B'Elanna that she just decided to enjoy the feeling.  The truth was, laying here like this with Seven was calling up a murmur, a tiny echo from somewhere deep in B'Elanna's heart that said, despite her attempts to convince herself otherwise, she needed this kind of contact. For a moment she allowed hope to stir in her heart.</p>

<p>"I guess we should think about getting up before my daughter makes the decision for us."</p>

<p>B'Elanna started to move her hand away from Seven's side where she had been holding her when she felt the young drone flinch.</p>

<p>"Sorry, did I hurt you?" she cried.</p>

<p>"No, I just&#133;" Seven didn't finish.</p>

<p>B'Elanna saw the look on Seven's face and knew instantly what had happened.</p>

<p>"Why Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct to Unimatrix Zero One, I believe you are ticklish." B'Elanna crowed.</p>

<p>"Ridiculous, I am Borg, Borg are NOT ticklish," Seven replied in her best Borg monotone.</p>

<p>"Oh really, then you won't mind if I do this," B'Elanna trailed her fingers back over the sensitive spot in Seven's side.</p>

<p>Seven squealed in a decidedly unborglike manner and attempted to twist out of B'Elanna's reach.</p>

<p>"Oh no you don't," the Klingon cried as she pounced on Seven, holding her down and tickling her mercilessly.</p>

<p>"You are in big trouble now," Seven challenged as she grabbed at B'Elanna, searching until she found the young engineer's own Achilles' heel.</p>

<p>It was B'Elanna's turn to try to escape now, but Seven flipped her onto her back and was pinning her down as she attacked the Klingon's sides with her hands.  B'Elanna tried to get out from under, but when she couldn't, she reached up over her head and grabbed the first weapon she could find.  She hit Seven full in the side of the face with the pillow and used the moment of surprise to wiggle away.  She got up to her knees and began to pummel Seven mercilessly, until the Borg found her own weapon and went on the offensive.</p>

<p>"I believe you have started something that you cannot finish Klingon," she gasped as she grabbed another pillow and began to swat B'Elanna with both of them. "Resistance is futile."  B'Elanna fought her way to the opposite side of the bed and leapt to her feet, careful to keep the bed between herself and the decidedly disheveled blonde on the other side.  B'Elanna knew it was now or never; she fired her pillow across the bed, hitting Seven squarely in the chest and made a break for the door.</p>

<p>Seven was on her before she had a chance.  "Hah, tactical error, you are now unarmed," cried Seven as she grabbed B'Elanna around the waist, hoisting her in the air before throwing her down on the bed and leaping on top of her to pin her down.</p>

<p>Seven found herself looking down into B'Elanna's deep brown eyes, and she froze at the sight.  For her part, B'Elanna lay absolutely still, enjoying the feeling of the younger woman's body holding her down.  She stared up and felt like she was drowning in the oceanic depths of Seven's blue eyes.  The hands she had placed on the young drone's shoulders to fight off her attack slowly slid up and around her neck and tangled in her hair.  They were both panting from the exertion of the past few minutes, but as they lay there, unmoving, they both seemed to forget to breathe.</p>

<p>Slowly Seven began to lower her head down to B'Elanna's feeling the gentle pressure of the young Klingon's hands guiding her lower. She paused, their lips a breath apart; just as the moment reached its breaking point, they heard a cry from the living room as Kate woke up to demand her breakfast.</p>
