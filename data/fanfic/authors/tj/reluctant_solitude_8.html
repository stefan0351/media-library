<!-- A Reluctant Solitude \ Part 8 -->

<p>Hours passed unheeded as B'Elanna lay on the floor of her quarters.  Her life was over and she knew it.  Oh, she would get up off the floor eventually and return to her duties...her heart might go on beating for another 60 years or so, but anything that mattered had ended when Seven had taken her soul and walked out the door.  She didn't pick herself up off the floor until an hour before the senior staff meeting at which point in time she did something she had never done since joining the Voyager crew.  She hailed Chakotay and called in sick to work.  She begged off going to sickbay, citing overwork and lack of sleep, and Chakotay agreed that she probably just needed to spend the day in bed.  She knew it wasn't a solution, but she simply wasn't ready to face Seven yet.  She couldn't bear to walk into the conference room for the staff meeting and see the look of disgust that would cross Seven's face when their eyes met.  Tomorrow was soon enough to face her future's end.  She had spent the night on the floor in tears and in thought.  She kept coming back to one simple question-how could she have missed it. Loathe as she was to admit it, she had missed it completely, and Seven had been right.  She had been using her honour as a shield, as an excuse to avoid putting herself in a position of vulnerability.  Her childhood had scarred her to the point where she just couldn't afford to have another piece of her heart, her soul, pulled out and destroyed.  It was a defense mechanism that had gotten her through to life to this point.  The problem was that she hadn't been aware enough, brave enough to realize that the time and the need for it had passed.  The truth was she was terrified of the prospect of opening her heart to Seven, and then losing her the same way she had lost everyone else in her life.  That fear had left her emotionally paralyzed for her entire life, it had paved the road to empty affairs, broken dreams, and a loveless arrangement with Tom Paris that was supposed to make things better, instead of irrevocably ruining the best thing that had ever happened to her.</p>

		<p>She couldn't really blame Tom, even though she wanted to.  She had let herself be wooed, had talked herself into believing his smooth patter despite knowing better.  She had no one to blame except herself, and now she was paying the highest possible price for her own cowardice.  She couldn't change the past, but she was ready now to do what she needed to do to fix the future.  She would talk to Tom tonight.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Seven had stumbled blindly through the corridors of Voyager for over an hour after she left B'Elanna's quarters.  The pain of what had happened was too much to take in all at once.  She could only think about it small bits, but it was like dying piecemeal...it eased the pain for the moment but in the end you were still dead.  She had finally calmed down enough to return to the Cargo Bay and prepare for regeneration.  She wasn't certain how she was going to face the next day, or the day after that.  She thought about calling in sick to work, or asking for a personal day, but her overriding sense of duty to her collective prevented her from taking advantage of that luxury.  She would go to work and face the consequences of her actions in the morning.  She knew she had been right to express her feelings to B'Elanna, but the look on the Lieutenant's face when she told her that she was disgusted by her was enough to tell her that their friendship was over.  She had been right about B'Elanna hiding behind her honour, and she had been right to point that out to the beautiful engineer, but she wasn't disgusted by B'Elanna...not at all.  She had simply struck out in her anger and her pain and now she had pushed the love of her life away forever.  She had gambled on love and had lost.  She hadn't been exaggerating when she had told B'Elanna that she would love her for the rest of her life.  Nothing would ever change the way she felt about the beautiful engineer, but she knew without a doubt that she had lost her forever.  She didn't know how she was going to go on functioning.  She had given her heart to another, and they had handed it right back.  For a dark moment she wished that she were once again a member of the collective; she never had to worry about feelings or broken hearts back then.  She shook her head to clear it of such negative thoughts and stepped into her alcove.</p>

		<p>Seven was concerned and relieved at the same time the next morning when B'Elanna didn't show up to the morning staff meeting.  She checked the computer records and they showed the Lieutenant logged off on a sick day.  Again her feelings were mixed; she was relieved that B'Elanna was all right, but angry with her for avoiding the meeting.  In the end her relief won out.  She didn't know how she was ever going to look at B'Elanna again.  Just the thought of being in the same room with her brought tears of sorrow and pain to her eyes.  She wrestled herself back under control, but for the first time since she joined Voyager she paid no attention to the meeting, and when it was over she couldn't have told anyone a single thing that had happened that morning.  As soon as the meeting was dismissed she left the room and went straight to Astrometrics, burying herself in her work for 12 straight hours at which point she returned to her alcove.  She spoke to no one.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna spent the day pacing her quarters, trying to find the words to do what she needed to do in order to get her life back on track.  The irony of the situation hit her again and again.  It was only because of Seven that she had the courage to do what she was about to do, and yet Seven was now lost to her forever.  She had cried an ocean of tears today, and still at the thought of the beautiful blonde she felt them spill over onto her cheeks yet once more.  As soon as the computer showed Tom as being logged off duty she took a deep breath and activate her comm badge.</p>

		<p>Tom initially told her that he had plans for the evening, but upon B'Elanna's insistence that he come to her quarters he reluctantly agreed to cancel them and have dinner with her.  He really didn't want to be bothered spending the evening with her, but something in her voice warned him that he better oblige her in this.  He decided that as long as he was canceling his plans he might as well make the best of it, so he stopped by his quarters, changed and replicated a bottle of wine to take to dinner.  There were worse things than an evening alone with B'Elanna.</p>

		<p>The dinner was strained as B'Elanna was preoccupied with her own pain over losing Seven, and Tom was anxious to have dinner over with so he could proceed to the next, more enjoyable part of the evening.  When B'Elanna asked him to join her on the sofa, his heart leapt.  It wasn't often that B'Elanna initiated the physical side of their relationship, but when she did he knew he was in for a memorable evening.  He took the wine glass from her shaking hand, and put it on the coffee table beside his own.  He leaned in to kiss her and was surprised and not a little annoyed when she pushed him away.</p>

		<p>"Tom, stop, we have to talk."</p>

		<p>Paris leaned in again.</p>

		<p>"We can talk later B'Elanna."</p>

		<p>"Tom, cut it out."  B'Elanna was clearly annoyed with him, and now Tom was curious as to what exactly was going on with the half Klingon.</p>

		<p>"Are you in love with me?"  B'Elanna had no idea what prompted her to ask that question.  It hadn't been at all what she had intended to say.</p>

		<p>"Wha...um..."  Tom couldn't even imagine what she was thinking, or just how exactly she wanted him to answer that question.  He decided to simply gloss over the situation.  "Sure, baby..I, uh...sure I love you."</p>

		<p>"Bullshit Tom...do you even know what love it?"  </p>

		<p>"What the hell is going on here B'Elanna," Tom demanded.  He was truly getting angry now.  He didn't appreciate being led on and then interrogated over irrelevant emotions.  He had better things to do with his time.</p>

		<p>"What's going on is that I'm ending our little 'arrangement' as of this moment."  There, she'd finally said it.</p>

		<p>"I don't think so B'Elanna.  If you think you can just dump me for the Borg you can think again.  You made a promise to me and your Klingon honour demands that you stick to the agreement.  </p>

		<p>"You don't want to use Klingon tradition in this case Tom trust me."</p>

		<p>"Why not, you and I both know that you freely agreed to our arrangement, where's the honour in backing out of it now?"  Tom was sure of himself here...he knew B'Elanna was adamant about preserving her honour.</p>

		<p>"Did you know that under Klingon law Seven has the right to challenge you to a fight to the death for me?"</p>

		<p>Tom's mouth opened, and then closed.  He finally blew out a long breath.  There several long moments of silence before he spoke again.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna, you're an amazing lay but hardly worth dying for."</p>

		<p>"That's about what I thought you'd say," she paused, "but the truth is that I can't imagine that Seven will ever speak to me again, let alone be interested in fighting for my hand."</p>

		<p>"Then...I don't get it, why end our arrangement if Seven is out of the picture."</p>

		<p>"Our 'arrangement' cost me Seven, and a real shot at love.  There was never any honour in this relationship, so I'm ending it.  And just for the record Paris, you've been hiding behind this relationship as much as I have.  I know you've been hurt by the people who are supposed to care about you in your life so you're afraid of getting involved with someone who might actually matter to you.  Maybe you should give some thought to not hiding behind all of your toys and games and give real life a shot Tom.  Maybe you'd be happier."</p>

		<p>"I'm plenty happy B'Elanna, but I still don't see why we can't keep on seeing one another as long as you and Seven aren't going to be getting together."</p>

		<p>"You just don't get it do you Tom.  You're like a child with a toy, you don't want it until someone else wants it, and then you pout when they take it away from you.  Just grow up... I know this is difficult for you, but we're through, and you should just move on, try to find someone you can care about."</p>

		<p>"God, you are so full of yourself Torres.  The truth is I'm relieved to be free of you.  No amount of sex is worth the work it takes to put up with your personality.  You're overly sensitive, violent, and a real pain in the ass, and you aren't half as smart or as good looking as you like to think you are.  The fact is that you aren't that special B'Elanna...I didn't get anything from you that I couldn't get from any one of a dozen women who are dying to sleep with me.  You are going to be a bitter old woman when we get back to the Alpha Quadrant Torres.  Enjoy the solitude."  Tom turned on his heel and left the room.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was stunned by Tom's outburst, and to her annoyance she felt tears forming behind her eyes.  As hollow as it had been, at least she wasn't completely alone when Tom was still interested in her.  Now, he was gone, Seven was gone, and the prospect of the next 60 years of her life was looking bleak.  She had no idea of how she was going to get through it, how she was going to face the future alone.  Still, she knew she'd done the right thing in ending things with Tom.  At least now she had some chance to regain the shreds of honour she had left.</p>

		<p>The next day B'Elanna was late for the morning meeting, but if she'd been on time she would have seen that Seven waited until the last possible moment to enter the room.  Had B'Elanna been on time there would have no opportunity for them to speak.  When B'Elanna rushed into the room five minutes late Seven schooled her features into a cool mask of unconcern and refused to even glance in the direction of the tardy lieutenant.  It would go on like this for weeks.  Seven, always a great observer of others, knew B'Elanna's schedule and habits well enough to be able to avoid any inadvertent contact with the half Klingon.  She always made certain to check with the computer as to the engineer's whereabouts before she entered the holodeck or the mess hall.  She knew she had lost any chance with B'Elanna when she'd poured out her venom on the lieutenant that fateful night.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna saw Seven's aloof behaviour and mistook it for distain.  She couldn't see how the former drone's heart was breaking as a result of their separation.  B'Elanna was falling apart, and it was becoming increasingly obvious to everyone on board Voyager.  She was often late for meetings and duty shifts; her paperwork and reports were consistently late.  It wasn't that she meant to neglect her duties; she just couldn't concentrate on anything but her pain for longer than an hour or so.  If she sat down to do her paperwork she eventually ended up crying herself to sleep, slumped over her desk.  She told herself daily to straighten up, but every time she saw Seven another small piece of her died, and work seemed to diminish in importance next to the magnitude of what she had lost.</p>

		<p>Seven began to wonder if she'd misjudged the lieutenant after all.  She had never thought the Klingon could be so negligent in her duties, or show so little concern for her collective.  She didn't really believe it, but from time to time it helped to ease the pain of loss if she found fault with beautiful engineer.  For her part she threw herself into her work with a vengeance.  She reported for work early, ate most of her meals in Astrometrics and continued to work until she returned to her alcove and took her rest.  Work and duty were all she had left now that her heart was nothing more than a black hole of pain.  It had also come to her attention that B'Elanna had begun to drink heavily in Sandrine's after her shift was over.  There had been two incidents in which security had to be called in order to break up an altercation between the engineer and another crewmember.  The second time it happened B'Elanna spent the night in the brig.  </p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>Captain Janeway and Commander Chakotay were in the shuttle bay getting the shuttle ready for their away mission to establish trade talks with the Reaylaini on Retaxia Prime when Janeway's comm badge came to life.</p>

		<p>&lt;Tuvok to Captain Janeway&gt;</p>

		<p>&lt;Go ahead Tuvok&gt;</p>

		<p>&lt;There has been another incident in engineering.  My security squad has contained the problem and I have confined Lieutenant Torres to her quarters pending your decision regarding appropriate punishment. &gt;</p>

		<p>&lt;Thank you Tuvok.  Janeway out. &gt;</p>

		<p>"Chakotay, I swear I am at my wits end as to what to do about B'Elanna.  She and her Klingon temper have this entire ship walking on eggshells.  It can't go on."</p>

		<p>"Katherine, I know that she's been going through a rough patch for the last little while, but I'm sure she'll pull herself together."</p>

		<p>"Have you talked to her?"</p>

		<p>"I tried, but she just told me that everything was fine.  I can't get her to open up."  </p>

		<p>In truth B'Elanna had been furious with Chakotay for interfering in her life and had told him so in no uncertain terms.  She'd come close to throwing a punch at him, and had Chakotay chosen to write her up there was no doubt she would have lost her commission on the spot.</p>

		<p>"I hate to say it, but if there's another incident I'm going to have to take her out of engineering and put Carey in charge down there."</p>

		<p>Chakotay sighed.  The truth was that he had had several requests for transfers off of B'Elanna's shift or out of engineering altogether.  Nobody wanted to work in a minefield.  Still, she was his friend and he owed her his loyalty.</p>

		<p>"Just give her some time Katherine."</p>

		<p>"I can't give her much more leeway Chakotay.  I have to put the best interests of this ship and her crew first."  Janeway paused for a moment.  "I think maybe we should go and have a word with Tuvok before we leave."  Chakotay nodded his agreement and the two of them left the shuttle bay together.</p>

		<p>When the doors to the cavernous room closed behind them, a figure stepped out of the Delta Flyer.  Tom leaned back against the shuttle and contemplated what he had just heard.  He hadn't really believed B'Elanna when she told him that she wasn't leaving him for Seven, but even he could tell in the last few weeks that they weren't even speaking to one another.  He had spent time thinking about B'Elanna's words to him on the night they had broken up.  At first he just ridiculed her, but he kept coming back to her words about his fear of being hurt, and hiding from love behind a fa&ccedil;ade of uncaring coolness.  He could see clearly now what B'Elanna's fear had done to her, and he wasn't anxious to follow in her footsteps.  He didn't love B'Elanna, but he was fond of her in his own way.  He had seen how she felt about Seven, and had done everything he could to keep B'Elanna with him.  He was feeling guilty and a little bit responsible for B'Elanna's situation, and he definitely didn't want to see her out of engineering.  His ship needed her, and he cared in his own limited way.  Maybe if he could help her out now, he'd start to feel a little better about himself.  He certainly couldn't feel worse about himself than he had been lately.  He made his way out of the shuttle bay and headed for Astrometrics.</p>

		<p>Seven looked up from her console on hearing the doors to the department slide open.  She was surprised to see Tom Paris come walking in.  She felt a surge of annoyance that the smug pilot would dare to enter her domain, but she quickly suppressed it and turned back to her work.  Tom nearly left after being subjected to Seven's obvious distain, but having determined to get involved he forged ahead.</p>

		<p>"Seven, can I talk to you for a minute."</p>

		<p>Seven wanted to say no, but instead nodded curtly, not looking up from her console.  Tom was uncertain what to do or say...he hadn't exactly thought this through, so he decided to just jump in with both feet.</p>

		<p>"It's about B'Elanna."  He saw Seven flinch at the mention of B'Elanna's name.  "I don't know if you know this or not, but she's in some trouble.  She could lose her job if she doesn't get her act together."</p>

		<p>"I fail to see why Lieutenant Torres' behaviour is any of my concern."</p>

		<p>"Look Seven.  I don't know what the hell happened between the two of you, but she broke up with me weeks ago, and I just assumed you two would finally get together, but now you aren't even speaking to one another and you're obviously both miserable.  No matter what happened God knows B'Elanna won't come to you, so why don't you just talk to her."</p>

		<p>Seven's heart leapt with joy as it sunk in that B'Elanna was finally free of her arrangement with Paris, but that didn't change the fact that her own behaviour and spite had driven the engineer away forever.</p>

		<p>"I have nothing to say to lieutenant Torres." Seven stopped there, and then for reasons she couldn't comprehend she told the arrogant flight controller the truth.  "Even if I wanted to talk to B'Elanna she wouldn't want to talk to me."  She felt a tear escape the steely bonds of her control and make its way down her cheek.</p>

		<p>"She's crazy about you Seven, she told me so herself."</p>

		<p>"You don't know...the things I said to her.  She will never forgive me. I drover her away, she hates me now and I can't blame her.  She will never want to be with me now."</p>

		<p>"You don't know that Seven.  I think she's dying to talk to you, but she's just too proud to admit it.  I think if you just apologized she'd be more than happy to just forget the whole thing."</p>

		<p>"I cannot apologize.  The things I said to her were harsh, but they were true.  I cannot rightly take back what I said."</p>

		<p>Tom saw the conflict clearly on the former drone's face.  She was in anguish over her split with B'Elanna.  He couldn't comprehend a love like that.  He'd never really felt it, and certainly no one had ever felt it for him.  He was starting to think he might like it if someone did.  </p>

		<p>"Would you rather be right than be with B'Elanna Seven?  Cause the way I see it you've got a choice here.  You can be right, or you can be with her.  It's up to you, but I know what I'd do."  Tom turned to leave.</p>

		<p>"Lieutenant Paris."</p>

		<p>Tom stopped and turned around.</p>

		<p>"You are a better man than you get credit for being. It would seem that you have hidden depths after all."</p>

		<p>"God Seven, don't say that so loud.  If you tell anyone that, it will start to get around the ship, then people will start to have expectations of me, and who knows where that could lead," the sandy-haired helmsman joked.</p>

		<p>"I hope that someday you will grow up enough to experience real love with someone.  As painful as this experience has been I would not trade one second of loving B'Elanna for anything in the universe."  </p>

		<p>Tom walked over to where Seven stood, still fighting for control of her emotions.  He placed a hand on her arm and gave it a reassuring squeeze.  </p>

		<p>"Just be happy Seven," he said before turning and leaving the room.</p>
