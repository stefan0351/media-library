<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 20 -->

<p>It only took them two days to travel the rest of the distance to London.  They made their camp a half-hour's ride outside of the town one night before they had to register with the tournament officials.  Sarah had proven to be an excellent addition to their group, and she fit in well with everyone.  She knew more about the plants in the woods than anyone else, and their food tasted a great deal better with all of the spices and seasonings she was able to provide from her walks in the woods. Although she was generally quiet she was possessed of a quick wit and a gift for storytelling that kept them entertained at night around the fire.  B'Elanna had never seen Harry looking so happy, and she couldn't have been happier for him if he truly was her brother. Each night the two of them took longs walks together in the woods and Sarah taught Harry the value and use of plants in the wild for eating and for the healing of wounds, and she taught him which plants to avoid as they would cause sickness or even death.  Harry was a quick learner and he was fascinated by all of the uses Sarah could find for seemingly nondescript plants that grew everywhere in the woods.</p>
<p>Even though they were still a fair distance outside of the city they could see the fires of other travelers who were arriving for the tournament.  B'Elanna began to get a little nervous at the thought of how many people would be there to witness this event.  The King himself sponsored the tournament and she couldn't help but worry that she would not perform well under such circumstances.  The King and selected men from several of his companies had returned from the war in France just for the tournament that bore his name. They would be returning to the battle after the tournament was over with supplies and gold in order to renew their efforts against the country across the channel. She knew that many of the King's own men who normally did not participate in the tournaments would be competing, and that she would have to be at her peak if she were to become champion at this most important of tournaments.</p>
<p>Annika sensed B'Elanna's nervousness and suggested that they retire to their tent early.  They helped one another out of their clothing and then Annika urged B'Elanna to lie face down on the bed.  She rubbed the oil that Sarah had prepared for her into the warrior's back.  B'Elanna felt herself relax under Annika's loving touch.  As she worked on relieving the tension she knew her wife was feeling, Annika talked to B'Elanna from her heart. She told her that she believed in her no matter what, and that win or lose B'Elanna would always be the champion of her heart.  That as long as B'Elanna acted with the strength of character and honour that Annika knew she possessed she would always be victorious.  B'Elanna felt all of her anxiety slip away as she listened to her wife's words and felt her hands on her body.  She turned over and pulled Annika into her arms, holding her close as they drifted off to sleep.</p>
<p>The next day B'Elanna was up before dawn in preparation for the busy day ahead.  Annika woke only long enough to help her into her clothes and then lay back down to rest.  Today was a day for registration and for setting up their tents inside the tournament grounds.  Only Harry and B'Elanna were going into the city this morning to register.  They would return shortly to help strike camp and prepare for the royal parade into the city and to the tournament grounds.  Tom was busy readying the armour and the horses so that they would be fit for presentation to the King.</p>
<p>The last time they had been to London they had done nothing other than visit the marketplaces in Eastcheap as well as the armourer's guild.  They had never ridden deep into the city, and they had not seen the royal tournament grounds.  Together they rode over London Bridge, marveling at the squalid houses that crammed either side of the road.  They made their way down the streets that led past the royal palace and into the arena where the tournament would take place.  There were hundreds of workers scurrying about the streets, hanging banners and making last minute preparations for the huge parade that would mark the beginnings of the games.  B'Elanna felt her stomach tighten with nerves and she forced herself to remember Annika's words of the night before in order to calm herself down. </p>
<p>Finally they reached the tournament grounds and sought out the registration tent.  Harry presented her papers to the registrar who studied them quickly before inquiring which events Lord Beyla would be entering.  Harry picked up the baton and struck the shield for the joust, and for the sword on foot.  The registrar took the pile of coins that constituted the registration fee and then handed back the letters of nobility.</p>
<p>"Welcome to London Lord Beyla," he said with a smile that didn't reach his eyes before turning to greet the next nobleman in line.</p>
<p>They followed a young lad of about 14 whose job it was to lead the knights to the place where they would pitch their tents and then inform his master that the spot was taken.  The boy ran ahead of them, obviously enjoying his position of importance for the day.  When he brought them to their designated area he carefully memorized Beyla's name and ran happily off to inform his master before retrieving the next Lord who required tent space on the grounds.  His smile widened immeasurably when he caught the silver coin that B'Elanna tossed at him after he completed his official duty.  </p>
<p>Their tasks complete for the moment, the two friends went in search of food before heading back to the campsite to move their family into town.  There was much B'Elanna wanted to ask Harry about Sarah and how he came to fall in love so quickly, but she needed to keep her mind focussed on the tournament.  She knew there would be time enough to talk after she was declared tournament champion.</p>
<p>They stopped by the marketplace to get some food to take back to the camp for the others and then picked their way through the labyrinthine streets until they made their way out of the city.  When they returned the others had already taken down most of the camp.  Meat was cooking over the coals of a fire, but their eyes widened with delight at the sight of the fresh fruit they brought back from the marketplace in London.  Harry delighted in teasing the others with the sight of the succulent and exotic oranges and apples that they had purchased.  In the end Tom chased him around the camp and pinned him to the ground while Sarah and Kate wrestled the bag of fruit out of his hands.  When the excitement was over, they all sat down and ate the meat that Annika and Sarah had prepared before they ate the entire the bag of fruit in a very few minutes.</p>
<p>It took very little time for them to take down the rest of the camp and stow the equipment in the wagon.  Soon they were all mounted and on their way to the city.  Sarah was more excited than the others as she had never been to London before.  Her entire life had been spent no more than a day's walk away from the village in the forest where she was born and raised.  B'Elanna watched her chatter and gesticulate with a smile on her face.</p>
<p>"It is hard to believe that just a year ago I had no more experience in the world than Sarah," she remarked to Annika as they rode.</p>
<p>"I cannot imagine you ever being so young and inexperienced.  When I met you you were already Lord Beyla and you seemed rather worldly and jaded to my eye."</p>
<p>"I was never so nervous in my life when I went to France to get my papers of nobility.  And I had never in my life seen someone as beautiful and exotic as you.  I guess I just hid it better."</p>
<p>"You had more to hide."</p>
<p>"Indeed."</p>
<p>"Although I do remember the dashing young Lord falling over his own feet several times at the banquet in Rouen," Annika teased gently.</p>
<p>"That was a night I'd rather forget," B'Elanna laughed easily.</p>
<p>"I see, you'd like to forget the night you first danced with your wife.  I can't say as it makes me happy to hear such talk after only three days of marriage."</p>
<p>"I can see that this is a discussion that will only lead me further into trouble."  B'Elanna shook her head in wonder at the way that Annika could so easily turn her back into the callow youth she was a year ago.</p>
<p>"And it is just such astute powers of observation that cause me to love you so well my dear."</p>
<p>B'Elanna arched her brow in a meaningful way and growled in a husky voice meant only for Annika's ears,</p>
<p>"That is not the only reason you love me my beautiful wife."</p>
<p>"You're awfully sure of yourself this morning."</p>
<p>"For good reason my Lady.  I believe that you told me not two nights ago how much you loved when I?"</p>
<p>"Stop?I beg of you.  You win.  I give up. What would the others think if they heard you talking of such things?"</p>
<p>"They would think that you are a lucky woman indeed," B'Elanna grinned in triumph. </p>
<p>"And they would be right."  </p>
<p>Their verbal sparring was interrupted when Sarah gave a cry of delight at the first sight of London in the distance.  Just the roofs of some of the stone buildings were visible over the tops of the trees, and Sarah had never seen anything remotely like this before.  All of the buildings she had ever seen in her life had been made of wattle and daub or of wood.  She was fairly quivering with excitement, and she held Harry's hand as she rode beside him on the increasingly busy road.  </p>
<p>As they came closer and closer to the city the road became crowded with wagons and horses.  B'Elanna recognized several of the people she saw as knights that she had jousted against in other tournaments.  She greeted several old friends and as they exchanged news she was inundated with congratulations on her recent marriage.  She deliberately kept the details of the ceremony vague and everyone she spoke to simply assumed they had married in a cathedral in a town outside of London.  Once she had told a few people she was certain that word would spread on its own quite quickly.</p>
<p>When they finally rode into the city Sarah fell silent and took in all of the sights, sounds and smells around her in awe.  The marketplace was more exotic than she could ever have imagined and the colourful clothing of its denizens drew her eye and held it long after they had ridden past. When at last she could no longer see the throngs of people crowding the marketplace she twisted back to face forward in her saddle and grilled Harry on the kinds of things one could see in such a remarkable place. It was only when he promised to take her there the next day that she once again fell into a silent contemplation of her surroundings.</p>
<p>They rode into the tournament grounds and quickly made their way to the area that had been set aside for their tents.  It didn't take long at all to set up the camp and see to the horses.  Soon there was little left to do but get dressed for the parade that would mark the formal beginning of the games.  Annika helped B'Elanna put on her armour, while Tom saddled Goliath and smoothed the richly coloured caparison over his gleaming black flanks. B'Elanna would ride in the parade while Tom and Harry would walk in front of her with her coat of arms held aloft to identify her to the spectators.  Annika, Sarah and Kate left early to procure a good spot from which to watch the ceremony inside of the arena itself.</p>
<p>When they reached the marshalling grounds for the parade B'Elanna was amazed at the sheer number of people who were lining up for the parade of champions.  Even the tournament at Rouen seemed small in comparison.  B'Elanna felt a familiar tightness in her stomach as she looked around at the warlike visages, and battle-scarred armour of the men around her.  This would be the first time she had faced so many real soldiers in the ring.  She knew she was quick and skillful with her sword and lance, but these were men who made their living by their weapons, and defeating them one after another would be no easy task.  Her skills had not been honed on the battlefield, but nonetheless her physical prowess and sense of honour would drive her to win at all costs.</p>
<p>The start of the parade was announced by the blasting of the herald's trumpets and soon the knights on their horses began to make their way out of the marshalling area and through the streets of the city toward the arena.  The din of the crowd was deafening and the multitude of banners and crests created a blur of colour and movement that had everyone's horse acting skittish.  Until they were clear of the marshalling grounds and spread out along the street it was all B'Elanna could do to control her mount.  Finally they were on the street and she could take a moment to drink in the sight of the crowd.  Even though she had participated in several such tournament parades she had not become jaded to the feeling of awe that so many people would come out just to see her and the other knights ride by on their horses.  The tournaments offered the citizens a glimpse into the lives of the nobility.  It allowed them to participate, in a sense, in a life that was normally outside of the scope of their existence.  It gave them a chance to forget the day to day to drudgery of their lives and to experience a spectacle the likes of which came but once a year.  The week of the tournament was like a holiday to most, and although many shops remained open during the event, business was slow during the hours of the tournament and often shop keepers would close for several hours during the day to allow themselves a chance to see the knights do combat before hurrying back to serve customers after the tournament slowed down for the day. </p>
<p>When they entered the arena they all rode past the royal box in single file.  As did the rest of the soldiers B'Elanna drew her sword just before she reached the box.  She turned her head to the right and raised the hilt of her sword up to her face, sweeping it down to her side and then back up again in a salute to the King as she rode past him on her way around the arena.  Finally they were all lined up facing the royal viewing stand, and the King spoke his words of welcome.  It was almost impossible to hear what he was saying from B'Elanna's position near the back of the arena so she contented herself with looking around until she found Annika and the others in the viewing stands.  Even from her vantage point she could see that Annika was looking back at her intently.  She was taken back to the first time she had ever caught a glimpse of that white blonde hair in the viewing stands at Rouen.  She was struck by a feeling of having come full circle, and being so much the richer for having made the journey.</p>
<p>When the opening ceremony was finished they made their way back to the camp and B'Elanna removed her armour before taking Goliath to the stables for the night.  The others were anxious to go into London proper and have dinner at a pub that they had heard mentioned earlier in the day.  B'Elanna wished to remain in camp and have a quiet and early evening before the start of the tournament.  She and Annika had a simple supper by themselves and then sat quietly by the fire.  Annika sat on a log that Harry and Tom had dragged over to serve as seating for meals and B'Elanna sat on the ground at her feet, leaning back against her legs.  Annika ran her fingers through B'Elanna's hair, and rubbed her shoulders knowing that the physical contact between them helped calm the warrior down and allowed her to focus on the next day's task.  In truth she was worried about B'Elanna's chances in this tournament.  So many of the participants were professional soldiers and she was concerned that her wife might be hurt in her attempts to win at all costs.  She never let on about her fears to B'Elanna however, she knew that the raven-haired woman needed her support and her confidence and she gave it completely.</p>
<p>When the fire burned down they went into their tent and prepared for bed.  B'Elanna removed her own clothes before she undid the laces of Annika's corset and eased the restrictive material away from her lover's skin.  She closed her eyes to concentrate on the feeling of Annika's skin beneath her fingers as she massaged away the marks left by the whalebone stays.  She leaned in close, molding her body to Annika's back and nuzzled into her neck, breathing deeply of the familiar scent of her lover.  Annika let her head fall back until it rested on B'Elanna's shoulder and surrendered to the feeling of the warrior's hands running over her body from her hips up to cup her breasts, massaging them gently.  She let her hands drift back to rest on B'Elanna's hips, pulling her closer still.  She turned to kiss the strong neck, her lips grazing the pulse point before seeking out wine dark lips.  Unable to keep her feet any longer she sagged back into B'Elanna, knowing that her wife would never let her fall. She felt the familiar surge of desire when B'Elanna swept her up into muscular arms. They sank on the bed together, supple limbs twining, hungry hands and lips searching until their desire reached its zenith and they cried out together in passion.</p>
