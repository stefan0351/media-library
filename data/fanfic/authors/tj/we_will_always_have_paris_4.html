<!-- We'll Always Have Paris \ Chapter 4 -->

<p>Seven found herself smiling as she went over the data she was collating from several long-range scans of the sector ahead.  She had been plagued with unpleasant memories of her past both as a borg drone and a crewmember onboard Voyager, so it was nice for a change to be experiencing the pleasant memories of the last few days spent in the company of Lieutenant Torres and her child.</p>

<p>Down in engineering the day was progressing nicely, B'Elanna had even had time to run several diagnostics ahead of schedule and had been able to spare several members of her team to take care of some upgrades they had not had time for previously.  Her good mood had once again rubbed off on her crewmembers and there was an uncharacteristic amount of laughing and joking going on in engineering.  'I could definitely get used to days like this,' B'Elanna thought to herself.</p>

<p>On the bridge Harry's brow wrinkled as he studied his console readout carefully, "Captain I'm picking up two ships on scanners, they just dropped out of warp and they appear to be on an intercept course," the young ensign informed Janeway.</p>

<p>"Time to intercept."</p>

<p>"5 minutes."</p>

<p>"Hail them, all frequencies, all languages, standard greetings."</p>

<p>"Aye Captain&#133;. No response."</p>

<p>"Keep trying Mr. Kim."</p>

<p>"They are powering weapons," came the dispassionate voice of Mr. Tuvok as two large ships rapidly closed the distance between themselves and Voyager.</p>

<p>"Shields up.  Red Alert, all hands to battle stations."</p>

<p>"They are firing weapons&#133;. Direct hit."</p>

<p>"Shields down to 87 percent."</p>

<p>"Return fire; target their weapons array."</p>

<p>Voyager was being buffeted by a barrage of fire from both ships. Their phaser fire was accurate but seemed to be having little effect on the enemy ships.  Several power couplings shorted out behind the science consoles at the rear of the bridge. Brilliant blue power arcs fried out several more of the stations as billowing acrid smoke began to flood the bridge.</p>

<p>"Shields down to 37 percent."</p>

<p>"Inertial dampers are off line."</p>

<p>Voyager began to rotate on its axis; the crewmembers scrambled to grab anything to hang on to as the ride became much rougher. Ensign Kim felt his shoulder tear as he attempted to remain at his post by gripping the side of the console while Voyager yawed wildly, listing hard to port as one by one her vital systems began to fail.</p>

<p>"Mr. Paris evasive maneuvers gamma 7."  Paris picked himself up off the deck plating and staggered back to the conn, using all of his piloting skill to buy engineering enough time to patch the ship back together so they could escape this viscous attack.</p>

<p>"Another direct hit to the shield emitters."</p>

<p>"Shields are down."</p>

<p>"Direct hit to the port nacelle&#133;we're venting plasma."</p>

<p>&lt;Engineering to bridge, we're losing containment. &gt;</p>

<p>"Warp engines are offline."</p>

<p>"Maneuvering thrusters only."</p>

<p>"Another direct hit&#133;. Hull breech on deck 15 section 6."</p>

<p>"Seal it," the Captain snapped as she braced herself in the command chair, watching her console in grim disbelief as Voyager appeared to be coming apart at the seams.</p>

<p>"Captain we're being boarded," Tuvok yelled as he reached for his phaser.</p>

<p>A phaser fight broke out on the bridge as several aliens beamed aboard.  Tuvok took two of the green scaly creatures out before he himself was hit by a phaser blast in the shoulder.</p>

<p>Harry managed to kill the other three aliens&#133;clearing the bridge of that immediate threat.</p>

<p>"Target the warp core of the lead ship and fire&#133;" Tuvok picked himself up from the ground and grimly bent to his task.  It wasn't easy with only one functioning arm but he managed to manually target the enemy ship and fire a full spread of photon torpedoes.</p>

<p>"Direct hit."  The enemy ship exploded into a million pieces&#133;the shockwave causing Voyager to spin even further out of control.</p>

<p>"Steady Mr. Paris&#133;."</p>

<p>"I'm trying captain."</p>

<p>"Engineering&#133;status report now!"</p>

<p>"The containment field is fluctuating, the power transfer conduit to the port nacelle is completely blown&#133;we may have to eject the core," B'Elanna's disembodied voice informed the bridge.</p>

<p>While she spoke another explosion could be heard over the comm as another plasma conduit burst in engineering.</p>

<p>Waves of burning mist began to fill up the engine room.  B'Elanna's first thought was for her crew. "Radiation leak&#133;Everyone out now&#133;. Computer seal off main engineering," she cried as she turned back to the task of stabilizing the warp core.</p>

<p>The shield doors began to come down and the crew scurried to get out of engineering as B'Elanna struggled to shore up the failing containment field.  The reactor core was heating up and she was afraid she would be unable to eject the core before it blew&#133;even if she managed to eject the core, without shields Voyager could be destroyed before they cleared the blast zone should the core breech in space.  Making a decision she beamed several tons of dilithium out of the storage bays near engineering as well as the excess antimatter pods&#133;hoping to minimize the possibilities of a chain reaction should the core explode in close proximity to the ship.</p>

<p>She could feel her lungs beginning to burn as she frantically worked to stabilize the core&#133;several radiation burns were appearing on her hands&#133;she ignored the pain as her hands flew over the console.</p>

<p>A shimmering blue light appeared beside her and she looked up in shock as Seven of Nine materialized inside of engineering&#133;</p>

<p>"Seven what the hell are you doing here&#133;. There's a radiation leak&#133;get out&#133;."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry Lieutenant, but I cannot leave you here alone."</p>

<p>She began to work beside B'Elanna&#133;it was possible that between the two of them they could stabilize the core.  B'Elanna was racked with a coughing fit&#133;bending over double as the burning in her lungs increased&#133;</p>

<p>"Seven, get out&#133;I can take it from here&#133;" B'Elanna was far from sure that anything could stop the breech at this point&#133;she desperately wanted her friend clear of danger.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry B'Elanna but I will not leave you"&#133;. Seven hesitated a moment and then came to a decision&#133;she leaned over and tapped the comm badge on B'Elanna's chest&#133;. "Emergency one to beam directly to the bridge."</p>

<p>B'Elanna tried to protest but only had time to hear Seven say, "I'm sorry B'Elanna, Kate needs you," before the transporter beam pulled her away.</p>

<p>When she materialized on the bridge she leapt directly to the engineering console with a growl&#133;Seven had already transferred the secondary controls up to the bridge after she had beamed B'Elanna clear.  The chief engineer began to vent the radiation from the engine room and worked to erect a level 10 force field around the core, she frantically rerouted every ounce of power Voyager's less crucial systems could spare in order to power the field. In the end it worked, giving Seven barely enough time to stabilize and shut down the core, eliminating the need to eject it.  After several more minutes of frantic work on both their parts the plasma conduits in engineering were locked down.  Voyager was dead in the water&#133;but she had survived&#133;for now.</p>


<p>"The other ship is closing in&#133;Weapons are offline."</p>

<p>"We're sitting ducks here&#133;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Paris, evasive maneuvers Gamma Pi."</p>

<p>"Captain we're down to thrusters only," Paris replied as he continued to try to evade the other ship's approach.</p>

<p>"Hang on Captain," B'Elanna spoke up. I just beamed several of the antimatter pods, and about two tons of dilithium 5000 km off the starboard bow&#133;their ship is going to pass the pods in 25 seconds.  I'm beaming a couple of mining charges from earth sciences over there&#133;when the ship passes by I'll remote detonate the charges and blow up the pods&#133;with any luck it'll take out the ship when it blows."</p>

<p>"Hurry B'Elanna&#133;"</p>

<p>Just as the ship passed the floating pods B'Elanna detonated the charges&#133;. The antimatter ignited with a tremendous explosion&#133;ripping through the enemy ship and destroying it.</p>

<p>Voyager was not immune to the effects of the blast and several more hull breeches were opened as she spiraled out of control for several long minutes before Mr. Paris used maneuvering thrusters to stabilize her flight.  They were safe, for now.</p>

<p>"That was quick thinking B'Elanna," Janeway praised the chief engineer.</p>

<p>"We're just lucky the ship happened to pass the pods, otherwise I'm not sure what we'd have done."  B'Elanna paused for a minute before saying, "Captain I really need to get down to engineering&#133;its going to be a real mess down there."</p>

<p>"By all means B'Elanna. Dismissed."</p>

<p>B'Elanna entered the turbolift, which was still functioning by some miracle, and headed down to engineering.  The closer she got the angrier she became with Seven's presumptuous and dangerous stunt.  By the time she entered engineering she was shaking with barely controlled rage.</p>

<p>She entered the remains of her engine room and saw the drone working on a console near the warp core.  She strode over, grabbing the young woman by the arm and spinning her around.  "Seven, what the hell were you thinking&#133;" The words died on her lips when she saw the extent of the radiation burns covering Seven's exposed skin.</p>

<p>"Seven, you need to report to sick bay immediately.  We'll discuss this later."</p>

<p>"I am not in need of immediate medical attention, I can assist in getting the repairs underway before I go to sickbay."</p>

<p>"Look Seven, you <b>will</b> be in need of immediate medical attention if you don't get out of my sight right now.  I need you to get the hell out of my engine room and go directly to sickbay&#133;. Understood."</p>

<p>Seven could see how angry B'Elanna was, but didn't want to leave without explaining her actions.  She opened her mouth to speak but was cut off by the whiplash of B'Elanna's next word.</p>

<p>"Comply!"</p>

<p>Seven dropped her eyes, nodded and immediately left the room.</p>

<p>B'Elanna was still shaking, but her anger began to fade into the background as she surveyed the wreckage that surrounded her.</p>

<p>She stepped up to the console and began to access the damage reports that were flooding in from all over the ship.</p>

<p>She worked for several minutes to access the damage and then began to divide her crew up into details that would address the most crucial problems first.  She was downloading her orders onto a PADD when she felt a hand on her shoulder and looked up into the face of Lieutenant Vorik.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Torres, you require medical attention.  Please report to sickbay, I believe things are 'under control' here for the moment."</p>

<p>"Right, listen, here is a list of the most immediate problems and the teams I've assigned to work on them.  You and Carey are in charge until I get back, I won't be long," B'Elanna said as she handed the PADD to the Vulcan.  Having taken care of her most immediate problem she left, swinging by the messhall to ensure that Kate was alright before she headed for sickbay.</p>

<p>When she got to sickbay she found it crowded with crewmembers who had sustained injuries during the fight; many of them were suffering from bruises and broken bones as a result of losing inertial dampers so early in the firefight.  Tom Paris was busy tending to the lesser injuries; upon catching sight of her radiation burns he sent her directly over to the EMH for treatment.</p>

<p>She sat on the biobed while he administered several hyposprays to counteract the effects of the radiation on her lungs and then he began to heal the lesions on her skin.  She sat as patiently as possible until she could contain herself no longer.</p>

<p>"Doc, has Seven of Nine been up here yet?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I treated Seven for similar injuries an hour ago."</p>

<p>"Is she alright?"</p>

<p>"She's physically fine.  Emotionally she seemed a bit overwrought.  I imagine that her first brush with death since regaining full access to her emotions will take its toll until she deals with it."</p>

<p>"Did she say where she was going when she left?"</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Torres, you know as well as I do that the hologram is always the last to know."</p>

<p>"Uh, right, look, thanks Doc, I feel much better now."  She hopped off the biobed and left sickbay over the protests of the doctor.</p>

<p>Torres tapped her comm badge. "Computer locate Seven of Nine."</p>

<p>&lt;Seven of Nine is in Cargo Bay 2. &gt;</p>

<p>B'Elanna was still furious with Seven for her actions during the firefight, and for a moment she debated the wisdom of seeking the young drone out so soon, but she knew she wouldn't be able to concentrate on anything until they had this out.  She strode to the turbolift and ordered it to Cargo Bay 2.</p>

<p>Upon entering the cargo bay she looked around for the young drone and saw nothing but the spare material containers that filled the bulk of the bay.</p>

<p>"Seven, are you in here?"</p>

<p>There was no response, so began to search up and down the isles for a sign of the young Borg.  Finally, way in the back where the wreckage of several Borg regeneration chambers was stored for spare parts she found the crouching figure of Seven of Nine.</p>

<p>"Seven, we need to talk."</p>

<p>The younger woman merely nodded miserably.</p>

<p>B'Elanna tried very hard to control her anger as she spoke.  "What the hell were you thinking back there Seven."</p>

<p>"I am unsure&#133;I believe it was an emotional response.  I needed to ensure your safety."</p>

<p>"At the expense of your own! You could have been killed&#133;"</p>

<p>"It seemed preferable to the loss of your life from radiation poisoning.  Kate should not have to grow up without her mother." Seven's voice cracked with emotion.</p>

<p>"If the core breached it wouldn't matter where I was &#133; both Kate and I would've been killed."</p>

<p>"I was certain that I would be able to assist you in stopping the breech&#133;Our combined skills are formidable."</p>

<p>"Seven, I was distracted when you beamed in&#133;I was so worried about you that I couldn't concentrate on my job&#133;that alone could have wasted enough time for the core to breech.  Your actions endangered this ship and could've killed us all."</p>

<p>"I did not think that my presence would distract you."</p>

<p>"You didn't think I'd be worried about you&#133;Seven, I couldn't bear to see you hurt."</p>

<p>"I was unaware that you felt&#133;."</p>

<p>"Seven, you're my friend&#133; I care for you and want to protect you. When you beamed in all I could think about was you getting hurt&#133;I lost my concentration."</p>

<p>"I am sorry B'Elanna. I had no idea."</p>

<p>"Yeah, well now you do," B'Elanna said gruffly to cover her emotions.</p>

<p>"Look Seven I have a dangerous job&#133;I know that&#133;it keeps me up at night worrying about what would happen to Kate if anything happened to me&#133;but these are the risks I accepted when I signed on for this job.  You have no right to interfere with that."  B'Elanna reached out, hooking her hand under Seven's chin she drew the young woman's face up until their eyes met.  "Seven, we've become friends and I'm glad of that.  I value our connection, but if you ever pull a stunt like this again its over do you understand me.  I can't be friends with you if it becomes a danger to this ship.  Do you understand what I'm saying?"</p>

<p>Seven nodded tearfully.</p>

<p>"I need to hear you say it Seven." B'Elanna said gently.</p>

<p>"I understand and I will comply, but you should be aware that I will always worry about you B'Elanna."</p>

<p>"Worry all you want, just let me do my job."</p>

<p>Seven nodded again.  B'Elanna stood up and offered her hand to Seven, pulling the young drone to her feet.</p>

<p>"Now, we have a ton of work to do in engineering if you feel up to it."</p>

<p>"You are going to allow me to assist you?"  It was more than Seven had dared to hope.</p>

<p>"As long as we understand one another, yes, of course. You said it yourself Seven, our combined skills are formidable."</p>


<p>The entire ship's complement was hard at work for the next five hours simply trying to repair the most crucial aspects of the ship's systems.  Finally, with hull breeches sealed and life support and inertial dampers online the Captain called the senior officers to the conference room for a briefing.</p>

<p>Every single person in the room looked tired and disheveled, including the Captain who had spent the last few hours assisting Harry Kim in repairing the sensors at the Ops station on the bridge.</p>

<p>"Well, we've had quite a day haven't we," she joked lightly as her haggard looking crew took their seats.</p>

<p>"I believe we can throw formality out the window for now&#133;B'Elanna give us some good news."  Janeway leaned back in her chair, looking oddly incomplete as the ubiquitous cup of coffee was missing from her hand; replicators were still offline.</p>

<p>"Oh you wanted good news&#133;I think I've come to the wrong meeting," B'Elanna joked.  "Life support is stable, I suppose that's one thing.  We did manage to get impulse engines back on line.  The force fields around the hull breeches are holding, for now.  I think that's all I have that can remotely qualify as good news."</p>

<p>"What is the status of the rest of the repairs."  Janeway leaned forward in her chair and pinned the young half-Klingon in her gaze.</p>

<p>"We have almost no antimatter left, the dilithium is almost gone.  There is no way to start the warp core for now.  We need to find a Class M planet where we can dock the ship or land in order to restock and make repairs to the hull and nacelles.  I won't lie to you Captain, we're talking about weeks of work, and we don't have the necessary equipment as it stands."</p>

<p>"What about replicators?"</p>

<p>"Pretty low on the list, I suggest we make due with what Neelix can produce until we restock on dilithium anyway."</p>

<p>"Mr. Tuvok, what do you have to add to this?"  Katherine was looking grimmer by the second.</p>

<p>"Shields are at 34 percent.  That is all we can manage at this time with the power levels available to us.  Weapons remain off line."  To look at him you would never guess at the extent of the peril Voyager was facing at this moment.</p>

<p>"Alright then Seven I guess it's up to you."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry Captain, 'up to me'?"</p>

<p>"To give us our good news.  What do have on long range scanners."</p>

<p>"Long range scanners are offline, it will take approximately 20 hours of labour to restore them.  I do however have the information from the scans of two days ago loaded into the computer.  I believe there are several planets in a system approximately one week from here at impulse power.  I cannot tell if they are warp capable with the information I have available, but several of the Class M planets are inhabited by higher-order life forms, and would be suitable for landing at the very least.  Scans showed several dilithium deposits on one of the planets.  We should be able to replenish our stock of crystals if nothing else."</p>

<p>"Well, that is good news.  I want the scanners to be top priority right now.  You and B'Elanna are assigned to that full time, and Harry will be available if you need further help.  Get the other teams working on the rest of the repairs that we can effect at this time."</p>

<p>"Captain," Mr. Paris spoke up, "I was wondering if I could take the Flyer and head out to that system.  I could do some scans and see whether or not any of the planets are good for landing, mining, trading whatever&#133;that way we wouldn't be putting Voyager in unnecessary danger if the species turn out to be hostile."</p>

<p>"Sounds like a good idea Mr. Paris.  Why don't you take Mr. Neelix with you and that way if you find out that they have what we need you can establish a dialogue and get trade talks underway before Voyager arrives.  I want you back here at least three days before we are due in that system so we can be adequately informed and prepared for our arrival."</p>

<p>"Thank you all for your hard work.  Now let's get back to it shall we."</p>

<p>B'Elanna was happy that it looked like Voyager had a hope of finding a safe haven for repairs. She was as anxious as everyone else to get some solid facts about the systems they were approaching. However, with Tom and Neelix gone and herself assigned to work with Seven full out on the sensor repairs she was in a bit of a child care jam to say the least.  She lingered behind to speak to the Captain about her predicament.</p>

<p>"Captain Janeway, may I speak with you for a moment," B'Elanna was overly formal, as she was feeling quite nervous about discussing her problem with the Captain.  Her job was important to her, and this was the first time that being a mother had interfered with her duties.  The fact that this was such a crucial time for Voyager only made B'Elanna feel worse about her situation.</p>

<p>"Yes B'Elanna," Janeway sense the young engineer's nervousness and did her best to put her at ease.</p>

<p>"I have a problem.  With Tom and Neelix gone I have no one to look after Kate.  I know that I need to work with Seven and the rest of the teams on repairs, but&#133;to be honest I'm not sure what to do."</p>

<p>The Captain looked a little startled by the chief engineer's words.  The fact that B'Elanna was a mother wasn't news to her, but this situation was novel for both of them.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure Samantha Wildman and the Doctor would be happy to help, their duties are slightly less pressing at the moment.  As a matter of fact I'm sure that I should be spending a little quality time with my Goddaughter as well.  Don't worry B'Elanna, I'll make sure that Kate is happy and occupied while you get to work on repairs.  We'll see to it that you get to spend some time with her as well."</p>

<p>B'Elanna was visibly relieved at the Captain's words, and began to smile for the first time in many hours.</p>

<p>"In fact, why don't you pick Kate up from the messhall and bring her to my ready room, that way I can have a visit while I work out a Kate-sitting schedule and you can get to work on the sensors."</p>

<p>"Aye aye Captain," B'Elanna smiled as she left to get her daughter.</p>

<p>Once she was certain that Kate and her namesake were going to be fine alone together B'Elanna headed back to work.  She stopped by engineering first and made sure that all of her crews were working away on repairs, picked up a tool kit and headed to Astrometrics to help Seven with the sensor repairs.</p>
