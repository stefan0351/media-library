<chapter title="Chapter 17">
<p>The confused look on Annika's face might have concerned B'Elanna had she not been expecting it.  Even so she felt her heart miss a beat as she contemplated the idea that Annika might simply say no without waiting to hear her explanation.</p>
<p>"But B'Elanna, how can we possibly marry, the church would never permit it."</p>
<p>"It is true the church would not marry us Annika, but there is a way we can be joined if you desire it."  </p>
<p>B'Elanna explained her plan to Annika and tried not to read too much or too little into her love's facial expression as she spoke.  When she was finished outlining her plan to Annika she paused for a moment before taking her heart into her hands once again and restating her question.</p>
<p>"Annika my love&#133;now that you know what I am asking will you consent to be joined with me for life?"</p>
<p>There were tears in Annika's eyes and she could barely find her voice to speak.  Finally she had to settle for nodding and a whispered </p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Even though she had been expecting Annika to say yes B'Elanna still could not believe her luck.</p>
<p>"Yes...You said yes did you not or are my ears deceived by the strength of my hope?"</p>
<p>"Your ears do not deceive you my love&#133;I assure you that I did indeed say yes."</p>
<p>"Yes&#133;YES!"</p>
<p>B'Elanna placed the ring on Annika's finger before sweeping her love up in her arms and spinning her wildly in circles.  She let the Lady's body slide down along her own until their lips met in a kiss of surpassing tenderness and passion.  Annika's feet had still not touched the ground and her heart itself had taken wings.  When B'Elanna finally set Annika back on the ground she continued to hold her fiercely in her arms; afraid that should she let her go the dream would end and she would find herself alone.  Annika rested her head on the powerful shoulders of her love and reveled in the feeling of being pressed so close to the woman she adored.  Time ceased to have meaning for them and it was several moments before either of them moved.</p>
<p>When they finally moved apart, Annika was surprised to see the joy so clearly displayed on the face of the normally reserved young warrior.  B'Elanna could barely contain herself and she found herself talking and laughing much more than was her custom.  She finally had to express herself in her preferred medium, the physical, by sweeping Annika off her feet and into her arms, carrying her off toward their camp. They were both oblivious to the amused or envious looks that were directed their way by the others that they passed.  There were both too wrapped up in their own world, which in these moments had contracted until it encompassed only the two of them.  Once again Annika marveled at the strength in her love's arms as B'Elanna carried her effortlessly back to their camp.</p>
<p>Tom, Harry and Kate were all sitting by the fire awaiting the arrival of their two friends.  Only Harry truly knew how important the evening was to B'Elanna, but the others had sensed that something was in the air and so had opted to stick close to the camp for the evening in order not to miss whatever it was that was about to happen.  When they observed B'Elanna approaching the camp with Annika in her arms they were at first concerned that something might have happened to the Lady, but the sound of laughter soon set their minds at ease.  They walked out to meet the laughing couple and were rewarded by hearing the two young women talking at once and at lightning speed as they tried to share their happiness with their friends.</p>
<p>When they all calmed down and were settled by the fire, Harry brought out a flagon of mead that he had brought back to the camp for the occasion and they all took turns toasting the happy couple.  B'Elanna once again explained how it was that they could be married in a formal ceremony.  Although it was unorthodox everyone knew how important it was for both B'Elanna and Annika to feel that their love and their union was celebrated with a ceremony and so they accepted the plan with unequivocal happiness.  They sat around the fire for over an hour making plans and dreaming out loud of the future.  Since they were skipping the next tournament there was no need to be on the road particularly early in the morning and so they stayed up talking and scheming until late into the night.</p>
<p>They awoke later than usual and had a leisurely breakfast in the now practically empty tournament grounds before tearing down camp and heading out on the road in a different direction from the rest of the competitors.  Because her mind was not on the tournament for a change B'Elanna found herself talking and joking more with her friends than was normal for her.  For the first time Tom and Kate were getting a chance to see what Harry had known all along, that being that B'Elanna was actually a much more funny and gregarious individual than they had previously suspected.  B'Elanna was having more fun than she had in a long time as she got to know the newest members of her 'family' better.</p>
<p>They had a long leisurely day of riding, B'Elanna was relieved to see that Annika and Kate were adjusting well to life on the road&#133;they seemed less uncomfortable than before and even seemed to be enjoying themselves.  </p>
<p>They stopped for the evening relatively early and only Harry was surprised to see Annika immediately change into more comfortable clothing and begin to help setting up the camp.  With all of the help they had this evening it was no problem for them to set up the tent completely.  Tom and Harry were even energetic enough to pick up their bows and go hunting for some fresh meat for dinner.  Kate gathered up wood and began brewing tea and roasting potatoes in the coals to go along with whatever Tom and Harry managed to get for dinner.</p>
<p>When they were coming back to the camp with the pheasants they had brought down with their bows, Tom was watching Harry carefully for his reaction to the scene that Tom was almost certain would greet them.  He was not disappointed when Harry stopped dead in his tracks with his mouth wide open at the sight of Annika and B'Elanna fencing in the clearing near the fire.</p>
<p>"What&#133;" was all he managed to get out as he continued to stare at the improbable scene before his eyes.</p>
<p>"I know&#133;it is really quite a sight isn't it."</p>
<p>Harry smiled finally and shook his head.</p>
<p>"Sometimes I think we are living in a completely different world from everyone else my friend.  I fear for the day when B'Elanna decides that I should wear a dress and act as her handmaiden and not her squire."</p>
<p>Tom couldn't help but smile at the picture Harry's words evoked in his mind.</p>
<p>"And what will you say if that day comes Harry?"</p>
<p>"Well, you've seen her in the sword ring Tom&#133;I'll say 'Yes my Lord' and hope she picks out a dress in my colour."</p>
<p>Tom slapped Harry on the back as the two men laughed uproariously and continued their walk into camp to prepare dinner for the group.  The irony of this fact was not lost on them.</p>
<p>Harry and B'Elanna had worked out the timing of this journey to perfection.  They would leave in the early morning the next day and arrive just outside of their destination by late afternoon.  This would allow time for everyone to bathe and dress for the ceremony that would take place that very evening.  Harry had arranged a surprise or two for the couple that he was very proud of, and he was looking forward to this occasion almost as much as B'Elanna.  He realized that his life would look slightly different once B'Elanna was married to Annika.  He would miss the closeness they had shared up until now, but was truly happy for his friend.</p>
<p>When everyone went to sleep B'Elanna and Harry remained sitting by the fire and talking softly.  Harry tried to express his joy at B'Elanna's happiness, and B'Elanna for her part talked openly about her hopes and even her fears as she prepared to take the most important step of her life.  She was afraid that Annika would not be able to withstand the rigours of a life spent on the road, and that eventually she would want to have a different kind of life.  B'Elanna realized that her life as a champion could not last forever.  Eventually she would have to find something different to do with her life; she would be forced to find a new way to make a living.  She knew that she had saved enough money to live comfortably for some time, and that if they were smart with the money she won over the next few years that they could have comfortable and simple life for some time.  But a simple life was not what she wanted to offer to Annika.  Lady Hansart deserved so much more than merely a 'comfortable' life, but B'Elanna was uncertain as to how she could ever possibly provide it for her.  With no land and no home to offer, her choices were limited.  </p>
<p>Harry knew that B'Elanna's fears were grounded in reality, but he also knew that Annika was deeply in love with his friend and that she was not longing for a life of leisure nearly as much as B'Elanna feared. However, he shared B'Elanna's concerns as to what would happen to them when the day came that his friend could no longer compete in the tournaments.  For this evening however, he merely encouraged her to concentrate on the joys the next few days would bring and put aside her more material worries.</p>
<p>Eventually the two of them talked themselves out and they were content to sit in silence and enjoy the fire.  When Harry finally said that he felt it was time for bed, B'Elanna asked him to bring their bedrolls out by the fire.  He was only too happy to comply and for the last time ever the two friends rolled up in their blankets beside the fire and fell asleep beneath the stars.</p>
<p>Everyone was up early the next morning and the camp was buzzing with excitement as they packed and prepared for the relatively short journey to their destination.  B'Elanna found herself feeling rather shy around Annika this morning for some reason, and so she kept to herself while they tore down the camp and had a quick breakfast before setting out on the road.  She trusted Harry with her life but was still worried as to whether or not all of the arrangements for the ceremony would meet her exacting demands.  She had given him instructions down to the finest detail and driven him crazy by going over her wishes again and again until he assured her he knew what she wanted.  Even so, as she rode to the village her mind kept wandering over everything that could possibly go wrong.  </p>
<p>She was lost in thought and so didn't notice Annika dropping back to ride beside her.</p>
<p>"Is everything alright my love?" she asked.  She could see the worry on B'Elanna's face and although she knew that the young warrior loved her very much she was concerned that she might be having second thoughts about solidifying their relationship with a marriage ceremony.</p>
<p>B'Elanna shook herself out of her reverie and saw the look of concern on Annika's face.  She knew instantly that Annika was feeling insecure and she hastened to reassure her that everything was all right.</p>
<p>"I am fine my love&#133;I&#133;I just want everything to be perfect."  In truth she was still worrying over what was to become of them and desperately trying to figure out what to do with her life, but she was not ready to discuss any of these worries with Annika just yet.  She didn't wish to burden her bride-to-be with such mundane matters.  She really did want the entire day to be perfect for her love.</p>
<p>Annika urged her horse closer to B'Elanna's and reached out to take the hand of her warrior.</p>
<p>"Things are always perfect when we are together my beloved.  I never knew what life could be like until I met you.  I thought I was living and that I was content, even happy with my place in the world&#133;it was not until I fell in love with you that I understood what it means to truly live.  I can't imagine anything more perfect than being allowed to live my life together with you.  So have no concern for mere details; we have already achieved perfection&#133;tonight is a celebration of that perfection&#133;not a means by which to achieve it."</p>
<p>B'Elanna could not believe her ears as Annika so accurately put into words everything she was feeling about their relationship.  She could not stop a tear from escaping the bounds of her control and tracking down her cheek.</p>
<p>"I love you Lady Hansart&#133;I don't understand what miracle of fate brought you to my life, but I give thanks for it with every breath I draw and I will continue to do so until I breathe my last."</p>
<p>It didn't seem that either of them trusted themselves to speak after such an uncharacteristic display of emotion, and so they rode on in silence, still holding hands, content in knowing that they no longer needed words to share their feelings for one another&#133;every touch and every look spoke eloquent volumes about their love.</p>
<p>They rode thusly together until they reached their camp.  The whole group hurried to set up the tent before eating a very quick meal and taking turns walking down to the river to bathe in preparation for the evening.  Annika and Kate retired to one half of the tent to dress the Lady for the ceremony while Harry and B'Elanna commandeered the other side for B'Elanna's preparations.  Tom took charge of the horses, getting the tangles out of their manes and tails and currying their coats until they shone. He then unpacked the first of Harry's surprises and finished saddling the horses before he went to bathe for the ceremony.</p>
<p>B'Elanna had a gift to give to Annika to wear at the ceremony and so she asked Harry to give it to Kate in order that Annika not be disturbed in her preparations. As for her clothing for the evening she had trusted Harry to purchase her clothes and she was not disappointed when she unpacked the costume he had chosen for her to wear this night.  </p>
<p>Finally she was dressed and had nothing else to do but to wait until Annika was ready and they could all depart for the ceremony.  She paced restlessly around her half of the tent, fiddling with the fit of her clothing, tying and retying the sash around her waist.  Finally Harry informed her that Annika was ready and that it was time to go.  She took several deep, calming breaths before she stepped out of the tent to greet her future.</p>

<chapter title="Chapter 18">
<p>B'Elanna was greeted by the sight of Goliath and Annika's palfrey Jet both saddled and richly caparisoned in crimson cloth with gold trim, the trappings were one of Harry's gifts to the couple and indeed the two horses looked magnificent as they stood side by side awaiting their riders.  B'Elanna was wearing a dark green tunic and tights with a white sash around her waist.  It was approaching winter and the temperature was cool so over her shoulders was a dark green cape lined with white thrown back over her shoulders.  Her only other adornment was her sword.  Harry stepped forward and handed her the second of his gifts, which was a golden circlet to wear on her head&#133;he purchased it to match the one he had helped B'Elanna buy for Annika.  They matched almost perfectly except that Annika's had a diamond set into its peak.</p>
<p>Annika was wearing the wedding dress that her mother had brought to her before she and Lord Hansart departed for France.  She was also wearing a cape that matched B'Elanna's; together they made a striking couple.  B'Elanna's breath caught in her throat when Annika stepped from her side of the tent in her wedding dress.  Her hair was piled high on her forehead, held in its place with the help of the circlet of gold.  </p>
<p>"You are the most beautiful sight it has ever been my privilege to behold my Lady," B'Elanna managed when she finally remembered to breathe. </p>
<p>Annika blushed at the complement and hastened to assure B'Elanna that she felt precisely the same way about her.  They both expressed their appreciation to Harry as they examined the beautiful cloth draped over their horses.  Soon everyone was ready and it was time to leave for the sacred grove.  B'Elanna lifted Annika into her saddle before she herself vaulted onto Goliath's broad back.</p>
<p>They rode out with the happy couple in front and the others following.  No one spoke as they rode side by side both busy with their own thoughts on this solemn occasion.  The group followed the track through the forest as they rode toward the enclave.  Soon they could see lights in the distance and as they arrived at the grove several of the villagers stepped forward to take the reins of the horses and help them to dismount.  Kate and Harry hurried forward to help their friends straighten their clothing and to remove their capes in preparation for the ceremony.  A young woman of the village came and drew Annika aside to describe for her what was about to happen and to teach her the parts of the rituals that she would be expected to recite.  A young man did the same for B'Elanna.</p>
<p>There were four young children, two girls and two boys who were waiting for Annika and B'Elanna to finish preparing for their wedding.  When they were ready the children stepped forward and took the hands of the celebrants, leading them toward the sacred grove.  The full moon was just coming into view over the horizon as the brilliant colours of the sunset faded in the western sky.  Harry, Tom and Kate followed along behind them, as did many of the villagers who were happy to help them celebrate their union.  When they reached the sacred grove they saw a very large circle marked out on the ground with quartzite rocks.  There were large beeswax candles flickering at four points of the circle marking the four cardinal points of the compass.  In the center was a large altar constructed from rock upon which several objects were laid out.  </p>
<p>The children led them to the east side of the circle, placing a circle of flowers upon both of their heads and kissing them on both cheeks before leaving to stand with the rest of the villagers to watch the ceremony.  Mary, the young woman who had healed B'Elanna's shoulder all those months ago, stepped into the grove and rang a small silver bell three times, indicating that the ceremony was about to begin. At this point B'Elanna took Annika's hand and led her once around the circle to enter it from the east again.  Annika was trembling with nerves as she walked with B'Elanna, but feeling the strength and steadiness of her warrior's arm she calmed down.</p>
<p>Mary walked four times around the circle, stopping at the candles to speak her invocation.  She returned to the centre of the circle, declaring the circle cast.  Turned to face the young couple and spreading her hands, palms toward the sky, the healer asked,</p>
<p>"Why have you come forth into the sacred circle on this night of the full moon?"</p>
<p>As one B'Elanna and Annika answered,</p>
<p>"We come to be joined together, so that we may be one in the eyes of the God and Goddess and of all of our friends here tonight."</p>
<p>Mary then turned toward the gathered crowd and asked,</p>
<p>"Is there anyone here present who knows of any reason why these two should not be handfasted here tonight?"</p>
<p>There was a moment of tense silence in which, thankfully, nobody spoke.  Then Mary continued with the ceremony.</p>
<p>B'Elanna and Annika exchanged the traditional vows of the handfasting ceremony.</p>
<p>"I have come of my own free will in perfect love and perfect trust to seek the partnership of my future spouse."</p>
<p>They exchanged simple gold rings reciting,</p>
<p>"I B'Elanna Torrance commit myself to be with Annika Hansart in joy and adversity, in wholeness and brokenness, in peace and turmoil, living with her faithfully all our days.  May the Gods give me the strength to keep these vows.  So be it."</p>
<p>Annika then repeated the vows to B'Elanna as a single tear tracked its way down her alabaster cheek.</p>
<p>B'Elanna and Annika then faced one another, joining both their left and right hands together; their arms and bodies forming a figure of eight, representing a symbol of perfect and infinite union.  Mary then took a red cord and knotted it tightly over their wrists indicating their intent to have a permanent relationship.</p>
<p>With their hands still knotted together B'Elanna and Annika then exchanged their personal vows.</p>
<p>"You are the person with whom I choose to spend my life.  I can imagine no more perfect joy than to share my life with you forever.  All that I am or ever shall become I dedicate this day to you, Annika, Lady of my heart," were B'Elanna's words.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna, I give myself to you this day heart and soul, body and mind.  You opened my eyes to all of the possibilities in life that I never dreamed of before I met you.  Thank you for loving me and accepting my love in return."  Annika had not had time to write her vows before hand, but she spoke from the heart and brought a tear to the eye of many of the guests present that night with her heartfelt words.</p>
<p>At this point Mary untied the cord from around their wrists and handed a knife to B'Elanna, who reached over and cut a lock of hair from Annika's head before handing her the knife so that she might do the same.  The couple then placed their combined locks into a small silver box, which they buried at the centre of the circle.  Mary then turned to them and gave her final benediction.</p>
<p>"Be understanding and patient, each with the other. Be free in the giving of affection and warmth.  Be sensuous with one another.  Have no fear and let not the ways of the unenlightened give you unease, for the Gods are with you now and always."</p>
<p>She then turned to the crowd and asked of them whether or not they would support the young couple in their marriage.  The answer was a resounding "I do," the loudest voice among them was Harry's.  Mary then pronounced the couple handfasted and asked that they exchange kisses as their first gifts to one another as a handfasted couple.  When their lips met in the first kiss of their married life the crowd cheered to signify their approval of the marriage.  At this point Tom and Harry picked up the broom that was leaning on the back of the altar and held it out.  B'Elanna and Annika joined hands and jumped over the broomstick, once again to the cheers of the crowd.</p>
<p>Mary then performed a small ceremony that banished the circle, declaring,</p>
<p>"The circle is open but unbroken. May the peace of the Old Ones go in our hearts.  Blessed be."  </p>
<p>She rang the bell three times and then B'Elanna and Annika walked the circle clockwise until they were back at the east side of the circle.  At this point they each lit a candle and using those individual candles they lit a third to signify that they were one.  They then used that candle to light two torches.  The rest of the villagers had all gathered up unlit torches and left ahead of the couple, lining the route to the banquet tent in pairs.  The first couple in the line then lit the torches of the next couple in line and B'Elanna and Annika walked beneath the raised torches of the villagers that lit the way to the wedding feast with the flames of their combined love.</p>
<p>The wedding feast was to be held in a large open tent lit brightly with torches.  The tent was festooned with wreathes of ivy and the tables were laden with food and decorated with bouquets of flowers.  B'Elanna and Annika led the way into the tent and took their seats at the head of the long table that would serve as seating for all of the guests.  Harry had asked that the villagers spare no expense when they prepared the wedding feast and he had used a goodly portion of the money they had retrieved from his father's house to pay for the food and mead that was laid out before them now.  The villagers, who remembered Harry and B'Elanna from their previous visit, had gotten into the spirit of the occasion and prepared a wonderful feast for this special night.</p>
<p>B'Elanna couldn't believe her eyes when she saw how beautifully everything had been arranged.  She had to blink back tears as she thought of how much work Harry and the villagers had done on her behalf.  She turned to Harry who was sitting just to her left and pulled him into a rough embrace, thanking him profusely for all of this effort.  Harry himself had tears in his eyes as he saw the last and most precious of his best friend's dreams come true.  </p>
<p>Annika was overcome with emotion after everything that had happened today.  She knew that B'Elanna had put a lot of thought into the ceremony and that Harry had personally made all of the arrangements.  The kindness of the villagers was most touching to her, as she knew that they were virtual strangers to B'Elanna and most certainly to her.  She was unused to kindness like this&#151;a kindness that asked nothing in return, that made no demands on its recipients.  In her experience people did not go to such lengths of kindness just out of the goodness of their hearts and it overwhelmed her to see that such people existed in this world.  She was happier than ever that they had decided to pursue B'Elanna's idea and be handfasted in the pagan tradition.</p>
<p>The meal consisted of roasted meats and vegetables and was absolutely delicious.  The men of the village had hunted for days to procure enough meat for all of them, and the vegetables had to be purchased from local farms, as the village could not spare enough of their own produce without leaving them short over the winter.  </p>
<p>Harry had ridden to several of the local farms to arrange for the produce to be delivered to the enclave.  One of the young village women had been his guide as he traveled.  Her name was Sarah and they had grown quite close over the course of the few days he had spent in the enclave.  He had been happy to see her again when they returned for the wedding and she sat on his left now at the table as they enjoyed the fruits of their labours.</p>
<p>Annika had only recently begun to spend time among what her father had termed the peasantry.  She was used to quiet genteel company in which women remained silent and only took their food after they were certain the men had had their fill.  To see an entire village sitting cheek by jowl, laughing and talking loudly, with the women and men eating together was entirely new to her.  She heard the women teasing and worrying at the men and again she marveled at how different this world was from the one in which she had grown up. She was ever more happy that she had left behind the stultified environment in which her family had existed.  She knew she would learn to love this atmosphere of raucous fun and irreverent humour.  She had seen B'Elanna interacting in a similar fashion with some of the other knights after tournament, but she had never realized that such a thing was in her reach.</p>
<p>She was enjoying the simple food as well.  She was used to food rich in sauces that buried the flavour of the ingredients; simple things like roasted meat appealed to her taste buds, although it had taken some getting used to initially.  She ate what was for her a hearty meal and as usual she marveled at how much food B'Elanna was able to consume.  She would have her hands full keeping her wife full; she laughed to think of herself as a housewife, but she knew that she would never be alone in her responsibilities.  She and B'Elanna would have an equal partnership in all such things.  She looked forward to all of the new experiences she would have now that she had embraced her new lifestyle.</p>
<p>When everyone had eaten their fill the men of the village leapt up and pulled the tables to the sides of the tent and several of the villagers pulled out musical instruments and began tuning them up.  Soon they began to play and everyone joined in the dancing.  This was a very different style of music and dance from that of the formal balls that the young couple was used to attending after the tournaments.  The villagers laughed at their early attempts to emulate the steps, and soon the young people were happily teaching the traditional folk dances to B'Elanna and her group.  It was a much more energetic style of dancing and B'Elanna thoroughly enjoyed herself, as did the others.  They danced until the moon was waning in the sky, and the village children had long since curled up under tables and benches and fallen asleep.  Everyone had consumed a quantity of mead and now the tired and happy crew began to trail away from the banquet tent toward their homes.</p>
<p>B'Elanna sought out Harry to find out where their horses were being kept so that they could return to their camp.  She nearly ran into him as she rounded the corner of the tent. She found him kissing the young woman who had been sitting with him at the table.  She wasn't sure who was more surprised&#133;she or Harry.  The young squire was blushing furiously at first, but eventually he had to laugh at the comical look on the face of B'Elanna.</p>
<p>"Er, what can I do for you B'Elanna?" he finally managed.</p>
<p>"Sorry Harry&#133;I didn't know that you&#133;I mean I didn't mean to interrupt you and&#133;I, uh, I was just looking for the horses&#133;I mean I was looking for you to see if you knew where the horses were.  Annika and I are going to head back to the camp now."</p>
<p>Harry laughed again at B'Elanna's embarrassment at catching him in the arms of a woman. </p>
<p>"Goliath and Jet are stabled in the village but you and Annika aren't coming back to the camp tonight.  You can hardly spend your wedding night on the other side of a tent from the rest of us now can you."</p>
<p>B'Elanna had not even considered such a thing.  In fact she had been so nervous about the night that she pretty much put it out of her head&#133;preferring to concentrate on more esoteric details such as food and drink.  She gave Harry a questioning look and he smiled and told her he would show her what he meant.  She noted that he kept hold of Sarah's hand as led the way to the last of the surprises he had prepared for the young couple on this special day.</p>
<p>B'Elanna gave Annika her arm and the two of them followed Harry and Sarah out of the tent and into the woods, picking up torches as they went to light their way.  Harry led them to a small path in the woods that had been strewn with wildflowers.  </p>
<p>"Just follow your nose my friend," he smiled, stepping aside and indicating the way with a flourish of his arm.</p>
<p>B'Elanna gave him a parting hug and a kiss on both cheeks before she took Annika's hand and followed the path of wildflowers into the woods.  The path took a few twists and turns and in the distance they could see a light.  As they rounded the final curve they saw a brand new tent pitched in a small clearing.  It was lit from within, and slowly B'Elanna led the way into the structure.</p>
<p>The tent contained a bed frame that was draped with sleeping covers and blankets; there was a small table that held a jug of water and a flagon of mead.  In addition Harry had somehow managed to have some of their belongings brought out to the tent at some point during the evening.  There were several oil lamps burning and a number of unlit candles set around the bed.  B'Elanna shook her head at how Harry had anticipated and arranged for all of their needs in such a lovely manner.  There was even some bread and cheese in a small basket so they would not have to worry about food in the morning.</p>
<p>Now that they were finally alone B'Elanna found herself unsure of what to do with herself.  Her stomach was filled with butterflies as she contemplated the next few hours spent in the company of her new wife.  She could tell that Annika was at least as nervous as she was herself and somehow this calmed her nerves.  She helped Annika off with her cloak and then removed her own, draping them over a nearby chair.  She unbuckled her sword and laid it aside.  Now that her usefulness was at an end she was again faced with the fact that she had no idea what to do next.</p>
<p>"Would you like a cup of mead Annika?" she asked as a way to fill some time.</p>
<p>"I believe I have had enough to drink, but if there is water I could do with a cup of that."  Annika answered.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was grateful to have something with which to occupy herself and so she hastened to pour two cups of water for herself and Annika.  They stood sipping their water in silence for an uncomfortable moment or two, until B'Elanna finally barked out a nervous laugh.</p>
<p>"We are behaving like a couple of teenagers and not at all like a married couple."</p>
<p>Annika had to smile at the truth in B'Elanna's words.</p>
<p>"I find that I am more than a little nervous," she explained.</p>
<p>"As am I my love, as am I."</p>
<p>B'Elanna sat on the edge of the bed frame and patted the mattress beside her.</p>
<p>"Come sit with me Annika my love."</p>
<p>Annika stepped to the bed and sat close beside her wife.  B'Elanna picked up her hand and held it softly in her own, rubbing her thumb gently over the back of Annika's hand.  She eventually brought Annika's soft white hand up to her lips and kissed it sweetly.</p>
<p>"You know there is no law that says we need do anything other than talk and sleep tonight," she said softly.</p>
<p>She had to laugh at the comic look of despair that flashed over Annika's face at her words.</p>
<p>"This is our wedding night B'Elanna.  We have waited for so long to be together.  Do you not desire me any longer?"</p>
<p>"Of course I do my beloved wife.  I have desired you since the first time I laid eyes on you in France.  I merely want you to know that if you are not ready, or you wish to wait until a later time I will respect your feelings.  I will wait as long as you need me to for our first time together to be perfect."</p>
<p>"I do not wish to wait B'Elanna.  I am merely uncertain as to what to do."</p>
<p>"To be perfectly honest my love I am not exactly sure what to do either, I only know that I wish to be with you and to show you how much I love and treasure you."</p>
<p>"Well, we are two intelligent and resourceful women&#133;I am certain we will think of something," Annika joked.</p>
<p>B'Elanna couldn't stop herself from laughing at Annika's comment and at last the tension between them was broken.  She took her young wife in her arms and pulled her close, their lips meeting gently at first and then harder, more insistent as the passion they had so long denied took hold of them both.  B'Elanna was thrilled to feel Annika's hands at her lap, loosening and removing the sash from around her waist&#133;apparently her wife's passions matched her own in every way&#133;this was a very good sign indeed.  </p>
<p>Annika felt her heart hammering in her chest, her passion swelling with each caress of her lover's hands.  She loved the feeling of B'Elanna's velvety tongue exploring her mouth, as her strong hands explored the contours of her body.  When B'Elanna tried to pull her up onto her lap her legs tangled in the restraining material of her dress.  She kissed her warrior wife once more and then stood up, pulling B'Elanna to her feet beside her.</p>
<p>"Help me," she asked softly, indicating that B'Elanna should untie the laces at the back of her dress.</p>
<p>B'Elanna obeyed with shaking hands and then watched as Annika slowly slid the heavy linen of her wedding dress from off her shoulders, allowing it to pool on the floor at her feet.  Her flawless alabaster skin was still obscured by the whalebone corset that cinched her waist in so tightly that it was only two hand spans across.  Annika loosened some of the laces at the front, but again she required B'Elanna's help to undo the laces in the back.  When B'Elanna released the laces and helped Annika remove the restrictive garment she was shocked to see the red marks cut into her wife's skin by the stays of the corset.</p>
<p>"I had no idea you suffered so much just from the wearing of your clothes," she said with real sympathy in her voice.</p>
<p>"They are not pleasant, but every lady wears one&#133;I am surprised that you yourself have never worn one B'Elanna."</p>
<p>"You forget I was a peasant girl&#133;with only my father to raise me I never really wore women's clothing.  He tried to get me to be a lady, but he was away so much with Lord Kim that eventually he just gave up and let me have me own way."</p>
<p>As she spoke B'Elanna was massaging away the redness on Annika's skin using her hands to smooth away the lines imprinted on the pale skin, too shy to touch the perfect breasts that had been revealed with the removal of the corset.  She dropped to her knees and pressed her mouth to Annika's waist, soothing the heated flesh with her tongue.  Annika was lightheaded when she felt B'Elanna's hands on her waist, but when she felt her wife's tongue begin to caress her skin she could no longer keep her feet.  She sank onto the floor beside the young warrior, and buried her head in her wife's neck. </p>
<p>As she nuzzled under B'Elanna's chin she drew in a breath and was intoxicated by the scent of her lover's skin.  She couldn't resist pressing her mouth to the hollow of her throat, and reaching out with her tongue to savour her wife's taste.  She wanted to explore her warrior's body more fully but was hampered by the fact that B'Elanna was still fully clothed.  With fingers unused to the task she slowly unlaced B'Elanna's tunic and slid it up over her head, then undid the loose linen shirt she wore beneath.  It was Annika's turn to be surprised when she saw the bindings around B'Elanna's chest.</p>
<p>"I see that I am not the only one who must wear restrictive clothing when out in public," she mused as she began to undo the wrappings and unwind the cloth bands from her lover's chest.</p>
<p>"A necessary evil if I am to pass as a man in public," B'Elanna replied.</p>
<p>Annika finished removing the restrictive bindings and stood back to marvel at the power and beauty that was revealed by its removal.  B'Elanna's breasts were small and pert and her shoulders, arms and stomach rippled with muscle.  She reached out to trace the red, ropelike scars that stood on in bas-relief on her warrior's body.  </p>
<p>"You received this when you saved my family from the highwayman," she mused.</p>
<p>"Yes and you bound my wounds and took care of me that day.  I think that day was when I realized that you were much more than just a beautiful woman&#133;you were brave and resourceful&#133;"</p>
<p>"I was frightened near to death that day," Annika interrupted.</p>
<p>"I would never have guessed you were frightened my love&#133;you seemed so calm to me."</p>
<p>"If I was calm it was only because I felt so safe with you there my Lord," she smiled,  "just as I feel safe with you now."</p>
<p>"It is my most sacred trust to ensure that you will always be safe my love&#133;I will spend my life to my last breath defending you and all that you care for."</p>
<p>Annika took B'Elanna's face in her hands, tears shining in her eyes, </p>
<p>"I know that you will my wife."</p>
<p>Their lips met once more and B'Elanna gathered Annika up into her arms and in one smooth powerful motion stood and carried her to the bed, laying her down gently without ever breaking the contact of their lips.  Annika's arms came up to twine around her neck, holding her close as B'Elanna stretched the length of her body along that of her wife.  She balanced on one arm and finally allowed herself to reach out and touch the perfect skin of her lover.  She stroked her fingers through Annika's hair and traced her exquisite jaw line; she let her fingers dance over the bone structure of her collar bone and down along the sides of her breast, eliciting a gasp from the younger woman's full and luscious lips.  She limned the outlines of her ribcage and down along her hip, pulling the slim young body closer to her own. </p>
<p>In her, albeit limited, conversations about sex with her mother Annika had always assumed that it was something that proper women merely endured.  She had never heard one word about pleasure or desire and she had been fully prepared to merely get through the night in hopes that B'Elanna as a woman would not demand lovemaking too often.  So it was that she was shocked by the passion and desire that she felt coursing through her body with every touch of her wife's hands.  She ached to explore her lover's body with hands and lips, and was surprised to hear herself moaning in pleasure at B'Elanna's touch.  She couldn't stop her body from pressing against B'Elanna's in an effort to maximize the contact between them.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna was operating on instinct alone as she moved her body over Annika's, balancing on her elbows and knees between her legs.  She lowered herself gently down until the aching tips of her breasts brushed against the nipples of Annika's as they strained upward to meet her.  At the moment of contact the sensation was so exquisite that they gasped in unison and B'Elanna had to fight to maintain control of her body and stop herself from collapsing on top of Annika. She rocked back and forth enjoying the sensations the movement evoked as their painfully erect nipples rubbed together.  She placed soft sweet kisses on Annika's mouth, flicking out her tongue to taste her lips, drawing one and then the other into her mouth, biting and then soothing them with her tongue. </p>
<p>Annika couldn't stop her hips from pressing ever upward; she ached for contact with her lover, and her breath caught in her throat as B'Elanna lowered herself down until their centers met.  The sensation was electric and Annika instinctively locked her legs around B'Elanna in an attempt to draw her ever closer.  The shy young blonde gave herself completely over to the sensations she was experiencing&#133;she allowed her hands to wander all over B'Elanna's body, relishing the feeling of her wife's muscles working as she made sweet love to her.  She reached up to cup the warrior's breasts, rolling her cinnamon coloured nipples between her fingers, loving the sound of B'Elanna's moans as she did so.  She felt their sweat soaked bodies sliding together and heard the ragged sound of B'Elanna's passion-laboured breathing; this was pleasure and sensation beyond her wildest imagining.</p>
<p>Loving B'Elanna had set her free and now it was giving her wings.  The pressure was building in both of them, but it was Annika who reached the breaking point first&#133;the sound of her name torn from her lover's mouth sent B'Elanna over the edge almost simultaneously and she rolled to her side pulling Annika on top of her, holding her tight and rocking them both through the aftershocks of passion that washed over both of them.  Many minutes passed before either of them were able to speak or move and when they did it was to move together once again in love.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter 19">
<p>When Annika opened her eyes the next morning it was to the sight of the sun-dappled canvas roof of the tent.  It took her a moment to get her bearings and realize where she was, and whom she was with.  Glancing down she was treated to the sight of B'Elanna's face, peaceful in repose.  She was shocked by how young and innocent her love looked when she was sleeping.  The contrast between the peaceful woman she saw now and the fierce warrior she had seen B'Elanna to be was striking.  It was hard to imagine that anyone believed that this sleeping beauty was a man, let alone a knight who ruled the tournament grounds and had taken the lives of three men in her short life.  It was odd to note that the violence with which she lived had not left its mark on her visage.  She could be any young woman as she slept here now.  </p>
<p>Her body was a different story.  Annika drank in the sight of her warrior wife's powerful body.  She admired the planes and angles of her face, and the peaks and valleys of her rippling muscles.  No woman looked like that, and Annika was quietly proud that she had managed to win the heart of such a one.  She stretched out her body, and for the first time she was aware of how good it felt to stretch out her muscles.  All of her life she had taken her body for granted&#133;knowing that its only purpose was decoration and childbearing.  She had never paid attention to how it felt, had never been present in her own body before now.  Last night had been a revelation of pleasure and sensation for her.  It had awakened her to possibilities she had never before imagined.  She stretched out again slowly, for the first time paying attention to how each movement felt.  She was feeling stiff and a little sore from her exertions both on the road and in bed last night, but she was surprised at how pleasurable and satisfying even that slight amount of pain could be.</p>
<p>She was feeling restless and did not wish to disturb B'Elanna's sleep so she eased out of her arms and out of bed.  She looked at her clothing strewn about the room and realized with chagrin that due to the nature of her clothing she was unable to dress herself without help.  Spying the loose linen shirt that B'Elanna had been wearing at their wedding she slipped it over her head.  It was loose and baggy and fell to midway down her thighs. The feeling of the clothing, and the fact that she was not wearing any of her customary restrictive undergarments was wonderful, as was the fact that the shirt was imbued with the wonderful scent of her wife's body.  She padded barefoot around the tent, pouring herself a drink of water and sipping the cool liquid while she explored her unfamiliar surroundings.</p>
<p>B'Elanna drifted into wakefulness slowly; she felt a sense of loss, inexplicable until she realized that she was alone in the bed.  She felt the covers beside her, still warm from Annika's body heat.  Opening her eyes wider and looking around she saw her wife drinking a glass of water on the other side of the tent.  She watched the beautiful young women tilt her head back, throat working as she swallowed.  She noticed with a smile that Annika was wearing her shirt.  Far from disguising her curves, the loose flowing material served to highlight the sensual beauty of her lover's body.  B'Elanna felt a surge of desire as Annika moved, the sun coming from the tent walls backlighting her body so that she was treated to a perfect silhouette of Annika's form.    </p>
<p>She levered herself up on to one elbow in order to have a better view of her wife as she moved about the tent.  Noticing that B'Elanna was awake Annika smiled shyly at her lover.  Upon seeing the answering smile spread over B'Elanna's face, she set down the cup and moved quickly back toward the bed, pulling the shirt off over her head as she walked.</p>
<p>Several hours later they finally managed to find the time to eat a simple breakfast of bread and cheese.  They were both feeling tired and hot so they decided to walk to the river for a swim.  Annika refused to relinquish the shirt she had purloined from B'Elanna so they dressed very similarly in tights and loose fitting shirts tied at the waist.  Neither of them bothered with constrictive undergarments and so they both felt rather exposed as they walked, but the woods were deserted and soon they forgot to be self-conscious and merely enjoyed the sense of freedom this type of dress engendered.  </p>
<p>They walked along the river until they found a secluded spot where the stream widened into a pool.  It took several minutes but B'Elanna finally talked Annika into removing her clothing and stepping into the water.  The younger woman did not know how to swim, but B'Elanna told her not to worry that she would look after her, and she knew B'Elanna would never put her at risk.  She let herself fall back into B'Elanna's waiting arms and the young warrior held her on her chest and kicked back into the pool.  Even though she couldn't swim she had absolute trust in B'Elanna's ability to hold her up and keep her from harm.  She leaned back, feeling her wife's perfect breasts pressing into her back, her strong brown hands resting on her belly as she moved them around the pool.</p>
<p>After floating around the pond for a little more than half an hour B'Elanna guided them over to water shallow enough for them to gain their feet.  Using a soapstone that she had brought along for the purpose they bathed in the slowly flowing water.  B'Elanna then searched along the shallow water until she found the arrowroot plant she needed.  Pulling several of the plants up by their roots she squeezed the milky juice from the roots and massaged it into Annika's scalp.  The liquid turned into a sudsy foam that washed the dirt and oil from her beautiful blonde hair. While Annika was used to the sensation of someone else bathing her, to B'Elanna the feeling of Annika's fingers massaging her scalp was amazing.  She leaned back and reveled in the feeling and Annika was more than happy to rub her new wife's head as long as B'Elanna was content to have her do so.</p>
<p>When they were both cleaned and rinsed they climbed out of the water and lay on the grass in the sunlight to dry.  Annika was unused to the feel of the sun on her skin, as it was not considered ladylike to for a woman of breeding to have any pigmentation to her skin. She couldn't believe what she had been missing her entire life as she felt the warmth of the sun and of the ground soaking into her bones.  She rolled onto her side and watched as the sun dried the droplets of water from B'Elanna's caramel coloured skin. Surprised at how quickly she became aroused just by looking at the muscular body of the woman she loved, she couldn't stop herself from reaching out to touch the sun-kissed skin of her lover.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna kept her eyes closed as Annika explored her body with fingers growing ever bolder by the minute.  She couldn't suppress a shudder of delight when she felt Annika's mouth join her hands in their exploration, and she could no longer keep still as she felt the weight of Annika's slight frame settle between her legs.  She wound her arms around her Lady's body, drawing her ever closer until their lips met&#151;touching off a storm of passion that would not be denied.</p>
<p>It was over an hour later when B'Elanna awoke on the sun drenched grass, Annika was asleep on her shoulder, the weight of her head a blessed burden on the warrior's arm.  The raven-haired woman brushed the hair back that was covering her wife's beautiful face and when treated to a full unobstructed view of the face of beauty she once again marveled at her luck in finding and capturing the heart of one so perfect for her as Annika.  In truth she could have laid on this bank all day and merely stared at the sleeping face of her wife and lover, but the growling of her stomach told her that she needed to make her way back to the enclave and find something to eat.  She kissed Annika's forehead softly, feeling the beautiful woman stir under her caress; slowly she kissed her way down to her Lady's perfect lips and captured them gently, feeling Annika awake in her arms and slowly begin to respond to her touch.  When they were both sated on the taste of one another for the moment B'Elanna moved her head back to get a better look at the beauty she held in her arms.</p>
<p>"Much as I hate to admit it I think we had better make our way back to the village my love," she said in a soft voice.</p>
<p>"Let me guess my warrior wife, your stomach is empty and you would rather fill its bottomless chasm then stay here and make love to your new wife?"  Annika teased, kissing B'Elanna once again to ensure her wife knew she was only having a bit of fun.</p>
<p>"The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak my love, and so will I be if I do not eat soon.  You can't very well have your wife starve to death on the day after your wedding now can you?"  B'Elanna gave back as good as she got, loving this new, more playful, side to her wife.</p>
<p>"Very well, then I suppose we ought to be on our way before I am forced to carry you back to the village myself," Annika said as he began to look around for their clothing which had been thrown haphazardly around the small clearing.  As they dressed Annika's stomach let out a most unladylike growl that sent them both into gales of laughter.</p>
<p>They made their way quickly back to their tent where they ate the last of the bread and cheese that was left over from breakfast.  Such a small amount of food was not sufficient for either of them and so they decided to get dressed and make their way back to their camp in search of a real meal.  When they had polished off the last of the food they were both a bit shy about asking for help with dressing, although neither of them was capable of clothing themselves completely without help.  Annika picked up the pile of cloth that B'Elanna used to bind her chest.</p>
<p>"Show me how to do this my love," she asked.</p>
<p>B'Elanna pulled the shirt she had been wearing off over her head and approached Annika.  She told her how the cloth needed to be wound tightly and tied off in order that her chest appeared as flat as possible.  Annika worked in silence until she was satisfied with the result of her work.</p>
<p>"Who performs this task for you normally?" she queried.</p>
<p>"Harry has always been the one to help me dress," B'Elanna replied truthfully.</p>
<p>Annika felt an emotion unlike any other she had experienced before.  She knew that Harry and B'Elanna were like brother and sister, but somehow the thought of anyone but herself seeing her wife's body bothered her.  A small frown appeared on her face prompting B'Elanna to inquire as to what the matter was.</p>
<p>"I do not like the idea of Harry seeing you without your clothing on," she admitted finally.</p>
<p>"Annika, honestly, its only Harry."</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, from now on I will be the one to help you dress in the mornings.  I wish to be the only one who is lucky enough to touch your skin and see your beautiful body."</p>
<p>"As you wish my love, but you do realize then that you must show me how to dress you, for I will be the only one to have that privilege from this point forward."</p>
<p>Annika smiled at the thought of her warrior wife struggling with the stays of her corset, but she had to admit that B'Elanna had a point.  It took them both much longer than usual to get dressed but in the end they managed make themselves presentable, although Annika was forced to wear her hair loose over her shoulders as B'Elanna was unable to master the art of putting it up in the regular style that Annika wore.  When they were finally finished dressing they walked back along the path until it joined up with the road.  They followed the sounds of voices until they found themselves in the village.  They were both pleased to find that their entire group of friends had returned to the village from their campsite this afternoon and so they sat down to the evening meal surrounded by everyone they held dear.</p>
<p>That night they sat in the village around a huge fire and listened to the songs and the stories of the villagers.  It was a night of happy and carefree laughter and joy.  Both Annika and B'Elanna felt more at ease here with these people than they had ever felt, and it took some time and discussion before they realized that it was because these people were among the few on earth who knew them in their entirety.  The villagers knew that B'Elanna was a woman, and they knew and accepted the nature of their relationship without judgement or disapproval.  It was a rare feeling and one they both accepted they would find in few places on earth.  The happiness and ease they felt here among these people would make their departure tomorrow all that much harder.  Nevertheless they were both committed to the path they had chosen, and it warmed them to know that they would always be able to find sanctuary here among people of the forest.</p>
<p>It was well after midnight when they all decided to call it a night.  Annika and B'Elanna held hands as they made their way by torchlight back to their tent.  B'Elanna carried a package of food for the morning and they had made arrangements with Harry and Tom to meet in the village in the morning to strike both of their camps together.  There was no shyness or trepidation between them this night as they reached their tent.  Annika's hands shook with anticipation and not fear as she helped B'Elanna out of her clothing, and soon they were together on the bed and in one another's arms.  Instead of falling asleep when their passion was spent however, they found themselves talking about the past few days and about their lives together.  B'Elanna had never in her life been much for words, and she was shocked to find that conversation felt as close and as intimate as their lovemaking had.  It was several hours before they finally fell asleep, safe at last in one another's arms.</p>
<p>The next morning they awoke at dawn despite the late hour at which they had finally fallen asleep.  They dressed quickly, becoming as they were, more intimately acquainted with the methods required to put on one another's clothing. When they were finished dressing the two of them together took down the tent that had been their only home since they were married two days ago.  While they were sad to be leaving the village behind them they were both looking forward to traveling to London for the last tournament of the season.  They enjoyed time spent on the road in one another's company and in the company of their friends. When they finished with the task of striking camp they stood for a moment in one another's arms before walking back to the village to meet their companions.</p>
<p>When they finally reached the village centre they were surprised to find that Sarah was standing with the group and that she had a small pile of belongings in a sack at her feet.  B'Elanna was unsure of what to do or say to this so she merely nodded to the group and waited for Harry to explain what was happening.  As she expected the young man approached her quickly and asked that he might have a word in private.  They walked a few feet away from the group and Harry took B'Elanna's arm and spoke in a hesitant voice.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna, I know we are bursting at the seams as it is, and I know that you are worried about money.  But I was thinking that perhaps I could find some way to contribute financially&#133;perhaps I could sell some of the game I catch in town or something&#133;"</p>
<p>B'Elanna smiled at his earnest attempt to alleviate her fears.</p>
<p>"Harry&#133;it's all right&#133;I just didn't know it was this serious."</p>
<p>"It is," he replied simply.</p>
<p>"Then the best argument for having her along is that you love her.  As to your financial contributions, Harry you already do more than your share of work on behalf of our little family.  Don't worry, we'll be fine.  The prizes at London are huge and should be more than enough for us to live on during the winter.  I'm happy for you Harry, everyone should have a chance to be as happy as Annika and I are now that we are finally together."</p>
<p>Now that the issue was settled Harry and the others began the job of loading up the wagon which was already full to the brim now that they had an extra tent to carry along with them.  Annika went out of her way to ensure that Sarah felt welcomed into the close-knit group.  It was obvious the young woman was no stranger to physical labour and B'Elanna watched, impressed with the ease with which the slender girl tossed the awkward and heavy canvas into the wagon.  She smiled to herself as she watched Harry and his new love work together.  They shared the same secret glances and fleeting touches that she and Annika did, and she was certain that Harry had chosen well the woman with whom he would share his heart and his life.  </p>
<p>In no time at all the wagon was loaded and the group bade a fond farewell to their friends and family.  They exchanged embraces and promises to return soon before they were once again on the road toward London.  B'Elanna dropped back to ride beside Harry and the two of them watched as Sarah, Annika and Kate chatted and giggled as they traveled.  The group was indeed bursting at the seams, but bursting with love and happiness and humour.  Rather than being more worried about their future now that their group had grown so large B'Elanna was in fact feeling calmer.  As long as they had each other she was certain that there was nothing they could not face together.</p>
<p>Smiling she spurred Goliath forward until she caught up with Annika.  With one arm she reached over and pulled her wife from her saddle until she was sitting sideways in her lap.  Her strong arm kept her anchored there and she kissed her quickly.</p>
<p>"I thought you might like to ride with me for a while.  I've missed you this morning," she whispered, her works for Annika's ears only.</p>
<p>Annika settled herself more comfortably in her new seat, resting her head on B'Elanna's shoulder.</p>
<p>"I love you too."</p>

<chapter title="Chapter 20">
<p>It only took them two days to travel the rest of the distance to London.  They made their camp a half-hour's ride outside of the town one night before they had to register with the tournament officials.  Sarah had proven to be an excellent addition to their group, and she fit in well with everyone.  She knew more about the plants in the woods than anyone else, and their food tasted a great deal better with all of the spices and seasonings she was able to provide from her walks in the woods. Although she was generally quiet she was possessed of a quick wit and a gift for storytelling that kept them entertained at night around the fire.  B'Elanna had never seen Harry looking so happy, and she couldn't have been happier for him if he truly was her brother. Each night the two of them took longs walks together in the woods and Sarah taught Harry the value and use of plants in the wild for eating and for the healing of wounds, and she taught him which plants to avoid as they would cause sickness or even death.  Harry was a quick learner and he was fascinated by all of the uses Sarah could find for seemingly nondescript plants that grew everywhere in the woods.</p>
<p>Even though they were still a fair distance outside of the city they could see the fires of other travelers who were arriving for the tournament.  B'Elanna began to get a little nervous at the thought of how many people would be there to witness this event.  The King himself sponsored the tournament and she couldn't help but worry that she would not perform well under such circumstances.  The King and selected men from several of his companies had returned from the war in France just for the tournament that bore his name. They would be returning to the battle after the tournament was over with supplies and gold in order to renew their efforts against the country across the channel. She knew that many of the King's own men who normally did not participate in the tournaments would be competing, and that she would have to be at her peak if she were to become champion at this most important of tournaments.</p>
<p>Annika sensed B'Elanna's nervousness and suggested that they retire to their tent early.  They helped one another out of their clothing and then Annika urged B'Elanna to lie face down on the bed.  She rubbed the oil that Sarah had prepared for her into the warrior's back.  B'Elanna felt herself relax under Annika's loving touch.  As she worked on relieving the tension she knew her wife was feeling, Annika talked to B'Elanna from her heart. She told her that she believed in her no matter what, and that win or lose B'Elanna would always be the champion of her heart.  That as long as B'Elanna acted with the strength of character and honour that Annika knew she possessed she would always be victorious.  B'Elanna felt all of her anxiety slip away as she listened to her wife's words and felt her hands on her body.  She turned over and pulled Annika into her arms, holding her close as they drifted off to sleep.</p>
<p>The next day B'Elanna was up before dawn in preparation for the busy day ahead.  Annika woke only long enough to help her into her clothes and then lay back down to rest.  Today was a day for registration and for setting up their tents inside the tournament grounds.  Only Harry and B'Elanna were going into the city this morning to register.  They would return shortly to help strike camp and prepare for the royal parade into the city and to the tournament grounds.  Tom was busy readying the armour and the horses so that they would be fit for presentation to the King.</p>
<p>The last time they had been to London they had done nothing other than visit the marketplaces in Eastcheap as well as the armourer's guild.  They had never ridden deep into the city, and they had not seen the royal tournament grounds.  Together they rode over London Bridge, marveling at the squalid houses that crammed either side of the road.  They made their way down the streets that led past the royal palace and into the arena where the tournament would take place.  There were hundreds of workers scurrying about the streets, hanging banners and making last minute preparations for the huge parade that would mark the beginnings of the games.  B'Elanna felt her stomach tighten with nerves and she forced herself to remember Annika's words of the night before in order to calm herself down. </p>
<p>Finally they reached the tournament grounds and sought out the registration tent.  Harry presented her papers to the registrar who studied them quickly before inquiring which events Lord Beyla would be entering.  Harry picked up the baton and struck the shield for the joust, and for the sword on foot.  The registrar took the pile of coins that constituted the registration fee and then handed back the letters of nobility.</p>
<p>"Welcome to London Lord Beyla," he said with a smile that didn't reach his eyes before turning to greet the next nobleman in line.</p>
<p>They followed a young lad of about 14 whose job it was to lead the knights to the place where they would pitch their tents and then inform his master that the spot was taken.  The boy ran ahead of them, obviously enjoying his position of importance for the day.  When he brought them to their designated area he carefully memorized Beyla's name and ran happily off to inform his master before retrieving the next Lord who required tent space on the grounds.  His smile widened immeasurably when he caught the silver coin that B'Elanna tossed at him after he completed his official duty.  </p>
<p>Their tasks complete for the moment, the two friends went in search of food before heading back to the campsite to move their family into town.  There was much B'Elanna wanted to ask Harry about Sarah and how he came to fall in love so quickly, but she needed to keep her mind focussed on the tournament.  She knew there would be time enough to talk after she was declared tournament champion.</p>
<p>They stopped by the marketplace to get some food to take back to the camp for the others and then picked their way through the labyrinthine streets until they made their way out of the city.  When they returned the others had already taken down most of the camp.  Meat was cooking over the coals of a fire, but their eyes widened with delight at the sight of the fresh fruit they brought back from the marketplace in London.  Harry delighted in teasing the others with the sight of the succulent and exotic oranges and apples that they had purchased.  In the end Tom chased him around the camp and pinned him to the ground while Sarah and Kate wrestled the bag of fruit out of his hands.  When the excitement was over, they all sat down and ate the meat that Annika and Sarah had prepared before they ate the entire the bag of fruit in a very few minutes.</p>
<p>It took very little time for them to take down the rest of the camp and stow the equipment in the wagon.  Soon they were all mounted and on their way to the city.  Sarah was more excited than the others as she had never been to London before.  Her entire life had been spent no more than a day's walk away from the village in the forest where she was born and raised.  B'Elanna watched her chatter and gesticulate with a smile on her face.</p>
<p>"It is hard to believe that just a year ago I had no more experience in the world than Sarah," she remarked to Annika as they rode.</p>
<p>"I cannot imagine you ever being so young and inexperienced.  When I met you you were already Lord Beyla and you seemed rather worldly and jaded to my eye."</p>
<p>"I was never so nervous in my life when I went to France to get my papers of nobility.  And I had never in my life seen someone as beautiful and exotic as you.  I guess I just hid it better."</p>
<p>"You had more to hide."</p>
<p>"Indeed."</p>
<p>"Although I do remember the dashing young Lord falling over his own feet several times at the banquet in Rouen," Annika teased gently.</p>
<p>"That was a night I'd rather forget," B'Elanna laughed easily.</p>
<p>"I see, you'd like to forget the night you first danced with your wife.  I can't say as it makes me happy to hear such talk after only three days of marriage."</p>
<p>"I can see that this is a discussion that will only lead me further into trouble."  B'Elanna shook her head in wonder at the way that Annika could so easily turn her back into the callow youth she was a year ago.</p>
<p>"And it is just such astute powers of observation that cause me to love you so well my dear."</p>
<p>B'Elanna arched her brow in a meaningful way and growled in a husky voice meant only for Annika's ears,</p>
<p>"That is not the only reason you love me my beautiful wife."</p>
<p>"You're awfully sure of yourself this morning."</p>
<p>"For good reason my Lady.  I believe that you told me not two nights ago how much you loved when I&#133;"</p>
<p>"Stop&#133;I beg of you.  You win.  I give up. What would the others think if they heard you talking of such things?"</p>
<p>"They would think that you are a lucky woman indeed," B'Elanna grinned in triumph. </p>
<p>"And they would be right."  </p>
<p>Their verbal sparring was interrupted when Sarah gave a cry of delight at the first sight of London in the distance.  Just the roofs of some of the stone buildings were visible over the tops of the trees, and Sarah had never seen anything remotely like this before.  All of the buildings she had ever seen in her life had been made of wattle and daub or of wood.  She was fairly quivering with excitement, and she held Harry's hand as she rode beside him on the increasingly busy road.  </p>
<p>As they came closer and closer to the city the road became crowded with wagons and horses.  B'Elanna recognized several of the people she saw as knights that she had jousted against in other tournaments.  She greeted several old friends and as they exchanged news she was inundated with congratulations on her recent marriage.  She deliberately kept the details of the ceremony vague and everyone she spoke to simply assumed they had married in a cathedral in a town outside of London.  Once she had told a few people she was certain that word would spread on its own quite quickly.</p>
<p>When they finally rode into the city Sarah fell silent and took in all of the sights, sounds and smells around her in awe.  The marketplace was more exotic than she could ever have imagined and the colourful clothing of its denizens drew her eye and held it long after they had ridden past. When at last she could no longer see the throngs of people crowding the marketplace she twisted back to face forward in her saddle and grilled Harry on the kinds of things one could see in such a remarkable place. It was only when he promised to take her there the next day that she once again fell into a silent contemplation of her surroundings.</p>
<p>They rode into the tournament grounds and quickly made their way to the area that had been set aside for their tents.  It didn't take long at all to set up the camp and see to the horses.  Soon there was little left to do but get dressed for the parade that would mark the formal beginning of the games.  Annika helped B'Elanna put on her armour, while Tom saddled Goliath and smoothed the richly coloured caparison over his gleaming black flanks. B'Elanna would ride in the parade while Tom and Harry would walk in front of her with her coat of arms held aloft to identify her to the spectators.  Annika, Sarah and Kate left early to procure a good spot from which to watch the ceremony inside of the arena itself.</p>
<p>When they reached the marshalling grounds for the parade B'Elanna was amazed at the sheer number of people who were lining up for the parade of champions.  Even the tournament at Rouen seemed small in comparison.  B'Elanna felt a familiar tightness in her stomach as she looked around at the warlike visages, and battle-scarred armour of the men around her.  This would be the first time she had faced so many real soldiers in the ring.  She knew she was quick and skillful with her sword and lance, but these were men who made their living by their weapons, and defeating them one after another would be no easy task.  Her skills had not been honed on the battlefield, but nonetheless her physical prowess and sense of honour would drive her to win at all costs.</p>
<p>The start of the parade was announced by the blasting of the herald's trumpets and soon the knights on their horses began to make their way out of the marshalling area and through the streets of the city toward the arena.  The din of the crowd was deafening and the multitude of banners and crests created a blur of colour and movement that had everyone's horse acting skittish.  Until they were clear of the marshalling grounds and spread out along the street it was all B'Elanna could do to control her mount.  Finally they were on the street and she could take a moment to drink in the sight of the crowd.  Even though she had participated in several such tournament parades she had not become jaded to the feeling of awe that so many people would come out just to see her and the other knights ride by on their horses.  The tournaments offered the citizens a glimpse into the lives of the nobility.  It allowed them to participate, in a sense, in a life that was normally outside of the scope of their existence.  It gave them a chance to forget the day to day to drudgery of their lives and to experience a spectacle the likes of which came but once a year.  The week of the tournament was like a holiday to most, and although many shops remained open during the event, business was slow during the hours of the tournament and often shop keepers would close for several hours during the day to allow themselves a chance to see the knights do combat before hurrying back to serve customers after the tournament slowed down for the day. </p>
<p>When they entered the arena they all rode past the royal box in single file.  As did the rest of the soldiers B'Elanna drew her sword just before she reached the box.  She turned her head to the right and raised the hilt of her sword up to her face, sweeping it down to her side and then back up again in a salute to the King as she rode past him on her way around the arena.  Finally they were all lined up facing the royal viewing stand, and the King spoke his words of welcome.  It was almost impossible to hear what he was saying from B'Elanna's position near the back of the arena so she contented herself with looking around until she found Annika and the others in the viewing stands.  Even from her vantage point she could see that Annika was looking back at her intently.  She was taken back to the first time she had ever caught a glimpse of that white blonde hair in the viewing stands at Rouen.  She was struck by a feeling of having come full circle, and being so much the richer for having made the journey.</p>
<p>When the opening ceremony was finished they made their way back to the camp and B'Elanna removed her armour before taking Goliath to the stables for the night.  The others were anxious to go into London proper and have dinner at a pub that they had heard mentioned earlier in the day.  B'Elanna wished to remain in camp and have a quiet and early evening before the start of the tournament.  She and Annika had a simple supper by themselves and then sat quietly by the fire.  Annika sat on a log that Harry and Tom had dragged over to serve as seating for meals and B'Elanna sat on the ground at her feet, leaning back against her legs.  Annika ran her fingers through B'Elanna's hair, and rubbed her shoulders knowing that the physical contact between them helped calm the warrior down and allowed her to focus on the next day's task.  In truth she was worried about B'Elanna's chances in this tournament.  So many of the participants were professional soldiers and she was concerned that her wife might be hurt in her attempts to win at all costs.  She never let on about her fears to B'Elanna however, she knew that the raven-haired woman needed her support and her confidence and she gave it completely.</p>
<p>When the fire burned down they went into their tent and prepared for bed.  B'Elanna removed her own clothes before she undid the laces of Annika's corset and eased the restrictive material away from her lover's skin.  She closed her eyes to concentrate on the feeling of Annika's skin beneath her fingers as she massaged away the marks left by the whalebone stays.  She leaned in close, molding her body to Annika's back and nuzzled into her neck, breathing deeply of the familiar scent of her lover.  Annika let her head fall back until it rested on B'Elanna's shoulder and surrendered to the feeling of the warrior's hands running over her body from her hips up to cup her breasts, massaging them gently.  She let her hands drift back to rest on B'Elanna's hips, pulling her closer still.  She turned to kiss the strong neck, her lips grazing the pulse point before seeking out wine dark lips.  Unable to keep her feet any longer she sagged back into B'Elanna, knowing that her wife would never let her fall. She felt the familiar surge of desire when B'Elanna swept her up into muscular arms. They sank on the bed together, supple limbs twining, hungry hands and lips searching until their desire reached its zenith and they cried out together in passion.</p>

<chapter title="Chapter 21">
<p>The next day B'Elanna and Annika were up before dawn.  They helped one another dress and then B'Elanna began to stretch and prepare herself for the sword fights in which she was scheduled to participate.  When her stretches were complete Annika rubbed her shoulders and back before helping her into her armour. She tied one of her scarves around B'Elanna's arm as a token and then buckled her lover's sword around her waist.</p>
<p>"Good luck today my love," she said softly, kissing B'Elanna's cheek gently.</p>
<p>B'Elanna held her wife close; drawing strength from the love they shared.  She picked up her helmet and then she and Harry left for the sword ring.  She was relieved to see that her matches for the day were all against men she had fought and defeated many times previously.  Getting a few fights out of the way to allow her nerves to settle was import if she were to be at her best to face the soldiers of the King's companies later in the tournament.  The first matches were close as everyone put forth an extra effort to win here in London, but as yet nobody had found a way to defeat B'Elanna's superior speed and skill.  The crowd began to roar her name after the first fight and once again she found herself touted as a favourite to win the event.</p>
<p>She watched several of the matches involving the King's soldiers and she was impressed with the strength of the men.  She took hope however in seeing that none of them seemed particularly quick.  She allowed herself a moment's hope before she forced her mind back to observing and preparing for the task at hand.  She easily progressed through the preliminary rounds and she went to bed early that evening knowing tomorrow would bring far greater challenges.</p>
<p>B'Elanna's first match the next day was against her greatest rival from the outlying tournaments.  They were friendly together outside of the sword ring and they chatted amiably while they waited for the bans to be called announcing their match.  Lord Dumphries described his match against one of the King's soldiers and offered B'Elanna what advice he could on how to defend against the superior strength and savvy of the battle-hardened men.  Dumphries had won his match, but only barely and he advised B'Elanna to attack swiftly and try to end the match before the force of their blows wore her down.  She thanked him for his advice and knew that it would serve her well to follow it.  </p>
<p>She and Dumphries squared off in the lists together and put on a masterful show of swordsmanship for the gathered crowds.  B'Elanna could sense that Dumphries was tired after his matches the day before and she could have ended the match sooner had she chosen, but she knew that her friend deserved better than to be rousted so thoroughly in front of this crowd and so she allowed the match to go on and Dumphries to make a good showing.  In the end she finished him off and accepted his congratulations as well as his gratitude as the crowd roared their approval.</p>
<p>She had an hour before her next bout so she decided to stay and watch some of the other matches.  Harry and the others fetched food from the camp and they stood on the fringes of the crowd and watched as the other Knights fought their battles.  B'Elanna was feeling good and the fact that her family was around her added strength to her conviction that she would be able to win even against the King's men.</p>
<p>When she entered the lists for her next match she took the measure of the man she was to face.  He towered above her and his armour was dented and scored from fighting on the fields of France.  She saw stains at the joints that looked suspiciously like dried blood, and she had to force herself to calm down and concentrate on the battle ahead.  They circled one another slowly at first and she could tell by her opponent's leisurely feints that he was not taking her at all seriously.  Her small stature and shining armour led him to believe that she was a mere dilettante and that he would easily defeat her.  His overconfidence was to her advantage and she quickly scored two points before he realized that he had a real fight on his hands.  He pressed her hard and she fell back in the face of his renewed onslaught.  She parried and dodged for all she was worth, and, as she hoped, he was not quick enough to land a scoring blow.  The match dragged on as his height made it difficult for B'Elanna to score another hit.  Finally she took a chance and allowed him to step inside her defenses.  He swung mightily and the hit nearly drove her to her knees, but she managed to keep her feet, and, as he was sufficiently off balance from the weight of his swing, she was able to score the winning hit before he regained his equilibrium.</p>
<p>The rest of the matches went much the same and although she remained undefeated at the end of the day, thus ensuring herself a spot in the finals, she paid a physical price that was much higher than usual.  When Annika helped her out of her armour that night she was shocked to see the extent of the bruising B'Elanna had suffered even through the plate of her armour.  She rubbed the liniment Sarah had prepared into the bruises and aches and B'Elanna felt better almost immediately.  Annika had to bite her tongue to stop herself from begging her wife to withdraw from the finals.  She couldn't bear to see the raven-haired woman hurt but she knew that B'Elanna would never consent to quit the tournament and that what she needed most was her unswerving support; she forced herself to put aside her own feelings and offer encouragement instead. She lay awake long into the night watching B'Elanna's peaceful sleep; hoping fervently that she wouldn't be too badly hurt in the days ahead.</p>
<p>The next morning was peaceful around the camp, as B'Elanna's final sword contest wasn't until the early afternoon.  They sat around the site talking quietly while cleaning and repairing equipment.  Sarah cooked a special stew that she insisted B'Elanna have two helpings of before her duel.  The young warrior was afraid that she would feel overly full and too sluggish to fight, however her fears were unfounded, as she felt stronger and more energetic than ever after the meal was over.  She tried to get Sarah to tell her the secret of her cooking, but the young woman simply smiled and demurred.  Eventually B'Elanna decided to stop questioning her good luck and be grateful for it.</p>
<p>When she buckled on her armour with the help of Annika they spoke quietly about the upcoming battle, and as ever B'Elanna felt herself strengthened by Annika's love and faith in her abilities.  She could sense that the beautiful blonde was worried that she would be hurt and she hastened to reassure her that she was able to take care of herself.</p>
<p>"Don't worry Annika, I'll be fine this afternoon."</p>
<p>"I know my love.  I can't help but worry about you, but I trust in your skill.  I have yet to see the man who can stand against you when you put your mind to a task."</p>
<p>"Indeed beloved, you are the only one I know who can stop me when I get an idea in my head."</p>
<p>"I'll believe that when I see it my Lord," Annika smiled.</p>
<p>"We'd better hurry or you won't get a good spot from which to see the fight."</p>
<p>"Yes it would be a shame if I couldn't get close enough to the lists to hear your grunting and be splashed with the sweat of the contestants.  I so miss that when I have to take a seat further away from the ring."  Annika finished tightening the buckles on B'Elanna's armour as she spoke, then helped her to her feet.</p>
<p>"Come on darling; its time for you to go win a championship."</p>
<p>They linked arms and walked toward the sword lists with the rest of the group falling in behind them as they made their way through the crowd.  They did manage to arrive at the ring in enough time for everyone to find a place to stand close to the fence.  All of her joking aside Annika liked to be close to sword ring so that she could keep an eye on B'Elanna as she fought.  Harry doubled checked B'Elanna's armour while she watched her opponent as he performed the same ritual on the other side of the ring.  He was a tall man with jet-black hair and darker skin that was marred by a long jagged scar that ran from his temple down his face and disappeared into his armour.  His mail was coal black and was liberally dented; it looked to be the armour of a man who had faced and defeated many opponents on the field of battle.</p>
<p>When they entered the ring he barely returned her salute before he snapped his visor into place and swung fiercely at her head.  She was forced to block his attack with her visor still open, and it was all she could do to parry his blows.  She stumbled backward around the ring, unused to feeling so off balance and back on her heels.  She was surprised when she felt the logs of the sword ring at her back.  She had nowhere left to go.  Her opponent raised his sword and brought it down with unbelievable force.  B'Elanna took the blow on the blade of her sword and the two weapons slid the length of one another until they jammed together at the hilts.  She took her chance and used the logs at her back to launch herself bodily against the dark knight. He couldn't hold her in place and she growled loudly as she gave him a mighty shove that sent him sprawling.</p>
<p>While he got to his feet she got her breathing under control and fastened her visor down, protecting her face.  When he regained his feet he did not rush back into the battle straight away.  This time he circled her slowly; finding himself flat on his back had given him a certain amount of respect for the diminutive knight he found himself facing. They both feinted lightly a few times, testing to see if there was a weakness that could be exploited.  Neither of them found a chink in the defenses of the other and B'Elanna resigned herself to hard fought battle.  The dark knight attacked again; his blows were a blur of metal and B'Elanna fought down a rising tide of panic.  She fought to control her emotions and was successful when she heard Annika's voice in her head telling her that she believed in her.  She was skillful in her defense and after a moment her opponent fell back to reassess his strategy.  She took advantage of this lull and rushed forward on the attack.  She constantly led him to the left, her weaker side.  All of her thrusts came from that side and as soon as she saw him settle into a routine she thrust quickly from the right and was rewarded with the sound of metal on metal as her blow went home and she scored the first point of the match.</p>
<p>Once again they circled slowly and B'Elanna was content to let the older man bring the attack to her once more.  She defended well, and was relieved to feel the fury of his attacks abating.  Perhaps he was tiring.  She renewed her efforts and was rewarded again when he misjudged her thrust and she managed to score a weak hit to his shoulder.  Weak as it was, the hit counted and she was one strike away from winning the match cleanly.  She allowed her jubilation to distract her for a moment, but that was all it took for the other knight to knock her sword aside and land a huge blow on the side of her helmet.  For a moment her world went black, and then erupted in a fireworks of colour.  The roar of the crowd seemed to fade away to an indistinguishable mutter, and then her head felt as if it exploded in a blinding burst of pain.  She felt her opponent land another scoring blow before she could pull herself together enough to defend against his attacks.  She was feeling dizzy and her vision was blurred, but she managed to hold herself together long enough stay in the game.  </p>
<p>When she regained her senses she began once more to try to find a way past his defenses.  With the score tied, the next hit would win and B'Elanna was determined to triumph.  They clashed several more times with neither of them able to score a blow.  B'Elanna was beginning to feel a bit desperate when he attacked once more stronger than before; he had fooled her with his tactics just as easily as she had him.  She summoned up all of her strength and began to hack away at him as if her were a tree she was trying to fell in the forest.  Her technique was completely gone and all she had left was her strength and conditioning. He parried her blows for some time, but always falling back before the fury of her thrusts.  She brought a crushing overhead swing down onto the edge of his blade, very near the hilt and couldn't believe her eyes when she saw the sword fall from his hand.  She quickly tapped him on the shoulder with the flat of her blade and the match and championship were hers.</p>
<p>The older man was shaking his head in disbelief that he had just been bested by a slip of a man who obviously only played at soldiers during the tournament season.  Yet he had to admit the man had been unrelenting and skillful in his attacks.  When fancy tournament techniques had failed the smaller man had relied on strength and will to win the battle.  He picked up his sword with a hand still numb from the last blow, and saluted the young Lord respectfully before leaving the sword ring to seek solace in a pint of beer.  Harry and the others were beside themselves with elation as B'Elanna made her way over to them through a throng of well wishers.  Her helmet was badly dented and it took Harry a few moments to undo the buckles.  Annika would not rest until she had thoroughly examined her wife to be certain she was not seriously hurt.  She had been terrified when she saw the dark knight land the crushing blow to her love's head, and it was some time before her heart slowed down even after she saw for herself that B'Elanna was fine.</p>
<p>B'Elanna's first joust the next day was not until the afternoon so the entire group made their way into the city to the pub that was favoured by the tournament crowd and they had dinner and many pints of ale that night before they made their way back to the tents. It was always fun for B'Elanna to be among the soldiers and to take part in their rough teasing and humour.  Annika was content to sit back and watch Lord Beyla with his friends.  She knew that B'Elanna needed this time to herself to really savour her victory with others who would understand what she had been through in the ring this afternoon.  For Sarah it was a revelation to watch the woman she knew as B'Elanna become the rough warrior Lord Beyla.  Even though she knew B'Elanna was really a woman she had a hard time believing it as she watched her drink and boast with the other warriors.</p>
<p>The next day was rainy and cold, but the tournament continued regardless of the weather.  As a group they decided not to attend any of the other events in this weather and so they remained in the tent for the morning, chatting and telling stories to pass the time.  B'Elanna finally heard the story of how Harry and Sarah had met as they traveled the countryside to take care of preparations for Annika's and B'Elanna's wedding.  Sarah had B'Elanna laughing until tears ran down her cheeks when she spoke of how awkward and shy Harry had been after he discovered that he was attracted to her.  Harry had stammered so badly that she thought he was telling her that he was telling her he admired her carrots rather than her character.  Later, when she sensed him standing close behind her she had turned to look at him and her cheek collided with his nose giving him a terrible nosebleed.  Harry blushed furiously as his secrets were revealed.  When B'Elanna started teasing him about his apparent addiction to carrots he retaliated by telling the story of their fireside dance lessons.  Annika couldn't resist joining in and describing B'Elanna's bumbling behaviour at the first banquet.  The little family laughed the dreary morning away and when they emerged from the tent to prepare for B'Elanna's first joust none of them even noticed the rain.</p>
<p>The joust was slightly less of challenge for B'Elanna than the sword competition had been, as jousting was almost solely a tournament sport and not used in battle.  Only their strength and the training of their horses gave the soldiers an advantage.  B'Elanna and Goliath had no problem overcoming the slippery conditions and they easily won the two matches they fought that afternoon.  Tom took Goliath back to the stables and washed him and his barding thoroughly before putting him up for the night.  </p>
<p>"You have certainly outdone yourself today my love.  I don't think I've ever seen you quite so dirty," Annika teased as she unbuckled B'Elanna's armour.</p>
<p>"I work all day to earn a living for you and this is the thanks I get&#133;you nag me over a little bit of dirt."</p>
<p>"A little bit&#133;I find it hard to believe that there is any dirt left in the jousting arena judging by the amount you seem to have accumulated on your clothes."</p>
<p>"Well, a little mud never hurt anyone," B'Elanna said as she attempted to pull Annika into her filthy arms.</p>
<p>"Oh no you don't&#133;you stay away from me," Annika cried as she twisted away from B'Elanna's hands.</p>
<p>"Only a few days of marriage and already you are rejecting my affections.  My friends warned me this would happen."</p>
<p>"And you'll be sleeping with your friends this evening if you get me dirty do you hear me," Annika squealed.</p>
<p>B'Elanna ignored Annika's warning and grabbed her into her arms.  The mud from her armour was smeared all over Annika's dress.  Annika continued to mock struggle for several more minutes before she relented and allowed her wife to claim her lips. Their hands became desperate as they struggled to remove the barrier of cloth and steel that stood between them and the skin they so longed to touch.  When they finally removed the last of the obstacles they sank down on the bed and traced trails of fire over one another's skin with fingers and lips aflame with desire.  Annika reveled in the feeling of B'Elanna's fingers deep inside of her and she felt her hips rocking hard into her lover's hands as she struggled to meld herself with her warrior love.  </p>
<p>When their need for one another was sated they lay together stroking and caressing, enjoying their closeness. Annika looked down at the streaks of mud all over her skin, transferred there from B'Elanna's hands and clothing.  She had never in her life been this dirty; she smiled when she thought of what her parents would say if they ever saw her like this.  A smile that deepened when she realized that it didn't matter what others thought, only how wonderful she felt when she was with B'Elanna like this.</p>
<p>"You are carrying the water for my bath tonight my knight in filthy armour," she teased, "AND you are washing my clothes.</p>
<p>"Yes dear," B'Elanna replied with mock subservience.  Despite the teasing nature of the conversation B'Elanna got to her feet and dressed quickly to begin to heat the water for their baths.  Once they were both cleaned up and their clothing washed B'Elanna and Annika joined the others in town for dinner in the tavern.  They held hands and teased one another like teenagers as they walked.  Neither of them could imagine being happier, and yet once they were surrounded by family and friends they found that they were.</p>
<p>The next day was rainy and cold as well, and B'Elanna had only a few contests, which she easily won.  Once again she found that she would participating in the joust final on the last day of the tournament.  They spent the day with friends watching some of the other contests and had an early evening in preparation for the finals.</p>
<p>The last day of the tournament dawned bright and sunny.  It was a welcome change from the dreary wetness of the past few days.  B'Elanna oiled and cleaned her armour to be ready for her competition and was at the lists an hour before she was scheduled to enter.  She watched the other knights as they competed for a spot opposite her in the final and she was not surprised to see that the dark knight she had fought in the sword ring was among the finalists.  He unhorsed his last two opponents with unerring blows to the chest and as he rode past where she waited he nodded at her in acknowledgment of the fact that they would once again face one another for all of the honours.  B'Elanna knew that he would be looking to win at any cost to make up for his defeat at her hands in the sword ring and she knew that it would require everything she had to give if she were to be victorious today.</p>
<p>She heard the crowd chanting her name as the herald announced the participants for the finals. She entered the lists and acknowledged the cheers as her opponent readied himself for the first tilt.  She felt her stomach tighten as she watched the man across from her.  His horse was larger even than Goliath and having felt the strength in his arm she knew she was in for the fight of her life.  The starter walked to the centre of the rail and raised the flag.  B'Elanna's entire world became the sight of that flag and when it was dropped she dug her heels into Goliath's flanks and they burst into the ring. She lowered her lance and sighted in on her opponent's shoulder; her concentration in moments like this was absolutely complete.  Nothing else existed as she bore down on him.  She could hear nothing but the beating of her own heart as the target grew larger and closer before her eyes.  She thrust forward with her body and lance and felt the tip strike his armour at the same instant she felt the hammer blow of his lance as it shattered on her chest.  It wasn't the hardest hit she had ever taken but it still took her several minutes to regain her breath.  She circled back to where Harry stood and grabbed hold of her second lance.  She watched while the young boys scrambled under the barriers to scoop up the splinters of the lances they broke as souvenirs.  She looked across the arena and was gratified to see her opponent with his visor up and appearing as if he too were having trouble catching his breath.</p>
<p>The starter was once again in the middle of the arena and she snapped her visor into place and prepared for the next round.  The roar of the crowd was immense as the flag dropped and Goliath reared up, taking two huge leaps on his rear legs before leaping forward into his charge.  B'Elanna once again sighted her lance onto the dark knight's chest and prepared for the impact.  Once again she felt her lance connect just seconds before her world exploded.  His lance caught her right in the centre of chest like a hammer to an anvil.  She was thrown backward onto Goliath's flanks, and only his smooth gait stopped her from sliding senselessly to the ground.  Annika started to her feet, her hand over her mouth to stifle her cry of horror as she saw her wife nearly unhorsed before her eyes.  As much as it would hurt B'Elanna to lose the match it would kill her to lose the animal that was more than just a mount to her, but rather more akin to a friend.  </p>
<p>Harry was at her side in an instant, holding her in place on Goliath's back and trying to ascertain if she were still conscious or not.  He got her visor open and was relieved to see that she was still breathing and that her eyes were open.  He splashed water onto her face in an attempt to revive her.  After a few moments she seemed to snap back into the real world.  He got her take a drink of water and asked some simple questions like the name of her horse to determine that she was alert enough to continue.  The judge gave them the warning that their time was up and that B'Elanna had to make another pass or forfeit the match.  She grabbed the lance from Harry's hand.</p>
<p>"The match is tied Beyla," he advised, "you're going to have to unhorse him or strike him on the helmet in order to win.  You just can't keep taking this kind of punishment or he'll wear you down and win, and maybe take your horse in the process."</p>
<p>"I don't think I can unhorse him Harry, he's just too strong."</p>
<p>"Then don't play his game.  If you can't outmuscle him, out finesse him.  A blow to the helmet will win if he doesn't unhorse you or strike your helmet in return.  I don't think he has that kind aim Beyla.  You can do this."</p>
<p>"It's a risky proposition Harry."</p>
<p>"I believe in you.  You can do this."  </p>
<p>The starter was in place and he dropped the flag just as B'Elanna fixed her helmet in place.  She charged ahead her mind racing with the possibilities open to her.  She sighted the lance in on her opponent's chest, hoping to make the hit and stay alive; at the last moment she remembered Harry's words and raised the tip of the lance, thrusting it forward into the helmet of the dark knight.  </p>
<p>The crowd came to its feet with a roar as B'Elanna's lance tore the helmet off the head of her opponent.  She hit him a fraction of a second before his lance would have slammed into her chest and it knocked his aim off so that his lance merely broke on her shoulder.  The hit to the helmet put her ahead however and she was the champion of the King's own tournament. When she turned around to see the result of her blow she saw the knight slumped over the neck of his mount while his squire tried to rouse him.  She was relieved when he finally sat up and took a drink from the water skin his squire handed to him.  </p>
<p>Annika pushed her way through the crowd, much less afraid of contact with the mass of strangers than she used to be; she even used her elbows to good effect as she made her way through the masses of people between her and her wife. She was in such a hurry that she even ducked under the barrier around the ring so that she could make her way over to where B'Elanna was standing with Harry.  Once again her heart did not stop racing until she had assured herself that her wife had suffered no lasting damage after the brutal match.  </p>
<p>Since the jousting finals were the last event of the tournament there was not much time before the awards ceremony.  She wiped the sweat from B'Elanna's forehead while Harry loosened her armour as they waited for the workers to finish assembling the dais where the King would stand when he made his presentations to the winners.  </p>
<p>The heralds blew the royal salute announcing that the King was making his way onto the platform.  B'Elanna was trembling with nerves at the thought of actually standing before the monarch.  She forced herself to remain calm as she lined up with the other event winners.  As overall tournament champion she would be presented with her prize last and so she had time to watch King Henry as he congratulated the winners of his tournament, all of whom save B'Elanna were soldiers from his regiments.  He took the time to speak to each of them and still before she knew it he was standing in front of her.  She swept a low bow and kept her eyes respectfully down while he presented her with her winnings and congratulated her on her superb performance.  The awards over, he stood back and made his closing remarks and then the trumpets blew pronouncing the ceremony finished.  B'Elanna was about to make her way back over to her friends when she felt a hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>"May we have a word with you Lord Beyla?"</p>
<p>She turned to find herself facing not only the dark Knight but also the King of England.  She nodded wordlessly and followed them out of the arena.</p>
