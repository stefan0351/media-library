<!-- A Reluctant Solitude \ Part 6 -->

<p>The dinner was awkward and stilted as both B'Elanna and Seven were desperately trying not to discuss anything that had happened in the last few hours, but since neither of them could think of anything else, the conversation lagged repeatedly.  And yet, they were both grateful that they were still friends and so they endured the awkward silences and forced themselves to discuss safe topics such as sensor arrays, and engineering problems.  When they finally said goodnight they were both equally relieved to be free of one another, but also, strangely reluctant to part.  </p>

		<p>Seven was glad that she had her alcove to rely on for regeneration.  She was in such emotional turmoil that she was certain that she would not be able to rest otherwise.  She did not envy B'Elanna having to achieve sleep this evening.  The memory of B'Elanna's lips pressed against her own was burned into her memory and she replayed the moment in her mind, reliving that instant of perfection that was to be forever after denied her.  The pain she felt at B'Elanna's rejection of her love in favour of Tom Paris' tepid emotional attachment tore at her soul.  She took the only escape open to her and stepped into her alcove, leaving the pain behind and resting in the tranquil sea of cybernetic oblivion.</p>

		<p>For her part, B'Elanna was indeed unable to sleep.  She had tossed and turned for several hours before giving up and padding out to her living and replicating herself a glass of wine in an attempt to relax.  Her mind was unable to racing in circles.  Seven had admitted to loving her!  Not just a crush, but love, and B'Elanna had no doubt that the former drone was sincere.  She replayed Seven's words in her head again and again.  The idea of someone loving her in this life and beyond was something she never in her wildest dreams thought she could have-to her it was another Klingon myth that she rejected.  She had always drifted in and out of sexual liaisons, taking comfort where she could find it.  After her parent's disastrous marriage, she had begun to believe that true love was just an illusion...something people convinced themselves of so that they wouldn't have to feel so alone in the world.  In fact, with the exception of Harry Kim, B'Elanna really couldn't say that she had ever really experienced true friendship until Seven of Nine came into her life.  And now, that same person, Seven of Nine was offering her love, and she wasn't free to accept it.  She had a relationship with Tom, and she was going to honour it...even if it killed her.   'Why don't you just call it what it is Torres, it's an arrangement, nothing more,' she berated herself silently. </p>

		<p>But still she couldn't stop her treacherous mind from returning again and again to the feeling of Seven's lips against her own.  It had been exquisite, soft and gentle and totally unlike anything she had ever experienced in her life.  A bitter irony that it came too late to save her from her own disillusionment.  She had accepted Tom's offer of a relationship, and agreed to his terms, and now she would be forced to live with the consequences.  How could she have known that her salvation lay in the Delta Quadrant if only she had been strong enough to wait for it.  </p>

		<p>She knew that Tom didn't love her, and she knew all about his holographic dalliances.  She'd accepted it all from the start, thinking it was better than being alone.  At first she thought that if she was the perfect girlfriend that Tom would grow up and be the man she knew he could be, and that their relationship would grow beyond its original parameters and into something real.  That hadn't happened.  Tom usually abided by their agreement...if she didn't demand too much of him.  He tried not to flirt too openly when she was around, and as far as she knew he had never cheated on her with another member of Voyager's crew.  In moments of utter soul-baring truthfulness she admitted that she was ashamed of her deal with Paris, and that this shame led to her own self-delusions about the reality of the relationship. Sitting here now, missing Seven, she was disgusted with herself for the way she had convinced herself that what she had with Tom was a relationship...she knew now it wasn't and it would never be.  </p>

		<p>Even before Seven declared herself, B'Elanna had sometimes wished that she never gotten involved with Tom.  She hadn't been in love with him, and she knew he didn't love her.  It was just that earth was so far away, and the nights in the Delta Quadrant were long if you were alone.  She'd let Paris convince her that it was better to share something physical now than to hold out hope that someday a miracle would occur and the perfect mate would magically appear in the middle of the Delta Quadrant.</p>

		<p>But that miracle had occurred, and B'Elanna's deal with Paris was now standing between her and real love and happiness.  If only she could have loved Tom, but at the time she was convinced that she could never really love anyone...now, when it was too late, she realized that she could.  With a growl of frustration she threw her glass against the bulkhead, watching with distracted disinterest as the red wine dripped its way down the wall and onto the carpet.</p>

		<p>The next morning B'Elanna tried to compensate for her lack of sleep by taking an icy hydro shower and ensuring that her uniform was neatly pressed and her boots highly shone.  She forced herself to eat breakfast and drank two cups of strong Raktijino before heading to the conference room for the daily meeting.  She had thought long and hard into the night, and finally, just before her shift began she had realized what she needed to do in order to begin to repair the damage she had done.  The most important thing of all to her was Seven; no matter what she was determined to do the right thing for the beautiful former drone.</p>

		<p>Seven was already in the room when she arrived and for several awkward moments they were forced to make small talk together until some of the other senior officers began to filter in to the meeting.  Once the meeting was underway B'Elanna couldn't help but surreptitiously observe the former drone.  Even though Seven had her alcove to regulate her sleep she looked less than fresh and alert.  B'Elanna felt a rush of concern for her friend.  Five minutes later when Tom Paris rushed into the room full of apologies for his tardiness B'Elanna was shocked that she hadn't even realized that he wasn't there.  She shook her head, realizing that if something was to change in her relationship with the pilot it was up to her to initiate the change.  She had given up true love to honour her commitment to him, so she was more determined than ever to make it work.  Despite her best efforts however, she was unable to stop looking at Seven, wondering what was going on beneath her inscrutable features.  When the meeting broke up she had to hurry to catch up with Seven, as the former drone rushed from the room as soon as the Captain dismissed them.</p>

		<p>"Seven, hey, wait up."</p>

		<p>Seven's heart fell when she heard the lieutenant calling her name.  She had studiously avoided catching B'Elanna's eye while the meeting was in progress; even so she had been acutely aware that the engineer had been looking at her throughout the meeting.  She could sense that B'Elanna was concerned for her, but wasn't sure her heart could take another falsely cheerful conversation with the Klingon so soon after the heartache of the previous night.  Still, she stopped and waited for B'Elanna to catch up with her, forcing herself to smile despite the pain in her heart.  B'Elanna's first words put her mind as ease.</p>

		<p>"Look Seven, I know I'm probably not your favourite person in the quadrant right now, and I don't blame you.  I know last night was awful, and I don't want our friendship to go down that road.  I did a lot of thinking last night and I just wanted you to know how important you are to me, and how important it is to me that you be happy, and that our friendship stay real.  So I just wanted to tell you that anything you need right now is fine with me.  If you need some space or some time then I'll support you.  Anything you want.  I'll always be here for you, whenever you want me just call okay...I'll be there."  She was out of breath when she finished the speech she had prepared, and she stood there self-consciously for a moment waiting for a response from Seven.  When none was immediately forthcoming she looked down at her boots for a moment, then took a deep breath.</p>

		<p>"Right...well, I just wanted you to know that okay.  I...I'll see you around Seven."  She gave the former drone a sad little smile as she turned to leave</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna wait." Seven had been so taken aback by B'Elanna's speech that it had taken her a moment to gather herself together.  She hadn't intended B'Elanna to feel rejected by her silence.</p>

		<p>"I just...I wasn't expecting this."</p>

		<p>"That's me...full of surprises."  B'Elanna tried to lighten the mood a little.</p>

		<p>"I wish to thank you for your consideration of my feelings.  I, I do feel the need to have a little space from you right now," Seven's typical bluntness stung, but B'Elanna bit back any reply wanting to give Seven all the time she needed to say what was on her mind.  "But I am also determined that our relationship be 'real' as you put it.  I just need to take some time to get my feelings under control, but then I would like to resume our friendship.  I will let you know when I feel able to spend time in close proximity to you."</p>

		<p>"Okay Seven, sure...just let me know." B'Elanna forced herself to smile despite the pain in her heart at the thought of losing her friend.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna," Seven once again halted B'Elanna's retreat with her words.  "I truly appreciate what you are doing, and the strength of character required to do it.  Thank you."</p>

		<p>"You, uh, you're welcome Seven."  B'Elanna grasped Seven's bicep and squeezed firmly for a moment, trying to convey with her touch all that she was unable to put into words.  "I meant what I said, I'm here for you whenever you need me."  With that B'Elanna relinquished her grip on Seven's arm and walked quickly away down the corridor, hoping that Seven hadn't seen the tears that were now spilling freely down her face.  This time Seven let her go, but was unable to take her eyes off the retreating form of the Lieutenant until she turned a corner and was gone from sight.  Fighting back tears for what seemed like the hundredth time in the last two days she turned and made her way to Astrometrics.</p>

		<p>Seven had felt a sense of relief that B'Elanna was offering to give her some space for the next few weeks, but that feeling was short-lived and was soon replaced by a sense of loneliness and longing.  Despite what had happened between them, and no matter how difficult the former Borg knew it would be to spend time in close proximity to the Klingon hybrid knowing they would never be together, she was tempted to seek out B'Elanna's company.  Still, she knew it was illogical and that she needed the space to steel herself to deal with the engineer and so she never made the comm call, even thought her hand strayed to the badge with a will of its own every few hours.  Even through the pain she missed B'Elanna fiercely and the daily staff meetings were both heaven and hell to her as they were the only time she spent in close proximity to the object of her affections.  In the meetings she drank in B'Elanna's presence as if she had been lost in the dessert for weeks and the Klingon hybrid was water, and her salvation, but B'Elanna kept a respectful distance and they never exchanged a word.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna didn't know what to make of her time away from Seven.  Tom, who realized he'd been pushing his luck with B'Elanna lately, and who was keenly aware that he now had competition for her time and affection, had spent more time with her than he had in the previous year.  He was being very attentive and was even attempting to find things to do that didn't leave B'Elanna bored to a near coma.  She appreciated his efforts and tried to convince herself that if only things were always like this, she would be content in their arrangement.   Deep in the sleepless dark of night however, she knew she was only lying to herself.  Every moment with Tom was like a hollow mockery of the reality she knew she could have with Seven.  Their conversations were surface deep and stultifying after only a few minutes together.  She found herself becoming repulsed at the thought of him touching her and began to long for him to go back to his holograms.  Their relationship was a dark, haunting simulacrum of the reality she knew was waiting for her if only she had the courage to reach out and claim it.  Yet she continued to convince herself that it was her honour that kept her bound to Tom, and so she accepted his attention while he lavished it on her, and secretly yearned for the restoration of her friendship with Seven.  At least when she had her friendship she had real emotions, and real connection, and she knew that would help her honour her commitment to Tom by keeping her sane.  All she knew for certain was that she was miserable when she was near Seven, and even more miserable to be apart from her.</p>

		<p>Seven held out for two weeks before she broke.  She entered the mess hall one afternoon and her heart skipped a beat when she saw the Klingon hybrid eating alone in the far corner of the room.  This had happened with regularity in the days since they had stopped seeing one another, but today Seven couldn't take it any longer.  She retrieved her lunch from Neelix and after hesitating for only a moment she made her way across the room and slid into the seat across from B'Elanna.</p>

		<p>Upon seeing the object of her thoughts appear in front of her as if she had wished her into being B'Elanna froze, her fork halfway to her mouth. It wasn't until the load of noodles fell from the fork to the plate with an audible splat that the spell was broken.</p>

		<p>"Seven...hey...it's really good to see you," B'Elanna stammered, unsure of what to do now that her fondest dream appeared to be coming true.</p>

		<p>"I...am...unsure of what I'm doing here," Seven said with uncharacteristic uncertainty.  "I just...I saw you here and, I've really been missing...I just wanted to talk to you."</p>

		<p>"God, I've wanted to talk to you too...I've really missed you Seven...really," B'Elanna's voice trailed off as she realized she was gushing and that perhaps her eagerness would put Seven off.</p>

		<p>There was silence between them for several minutes. B'Elanna pushed the food around on her plate while she tried to think of something to say that wouldn't end up sounding lame or bring up something painful.  Nothing came to mind. In the end Seven broke the silence by asking B'Elanna about the diagnostics engineering were running on the EPS grid.  It was all the cue B'Elanna needed and soon they were talking a mile a minute for the rest of the lunch hour.  As they were walking to the turbolift B'Elanna decided to push her luck and ask for Seven's help on the diagnostics and to her delight the former drone agreed to assist and told B'Elanna that she would come to engineering in an hour once she had her sector scans underway.  B'Elanna felt an overwhelming sense of relief...perhaps things would turn out after all.</p>

		<p>*Several hours later*</p>

		<p>"God damn it Seven!"</p>

		<p>"You are remodulating the power couplings incorrectly Lieutenant.  It is no wonder the diagnostics have failed to pin point the source of the power drain on the grid."</p>

		<p>"Give me that," B'Elanna shouted as she grabbed for the PADD Seven was holding in order to point out the error of the other woman's statement.  </p>

		<p>Seven refused to relinquish her hold on the PADD and for a moment the two of them engaged in a rather childish tug of war before B'Elanna burst into laughter.</p>

		<p>"I fail to see the humour in your childish behaviour Lieutenant Torres."</p>

		<p>"Kahless I've really missed fighting with you Seven," she chuckled, wiping tears from her eyes.</p>

		<p>"Indeed," Seven finally relented and graced her with a small, indulgent smile. "That does not however change the fact that you are in error with your remodulation of the power couplings."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna grinned sheepishly, "Show me again."</p>

		<p>Seven shook her head and began to outline the proper formula for realigning the power couplings, resting her hand on B'Elanna's shoulder as she did so.</p>
