<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 17 -->

<p>The confused look on Annika's face might have concerned B'Elanna had she not been expecting it.  Even so she felt her heart miss a beat as she contemplated the idea that Annika might simply say no without waiting to hear her explanation.</p>
<p>"But B'Elanna, how can we possibly marry, the church would never permit it."</p>
<p>"It is true the church would not marry us Annika, but there is a way we can be joined if you desire it."  </p>
<p>B'Elanna explained her plan to Annika and tried not to read too much or too little into her love's facial expression as she spoke.  When she was finished outlining her plan to Annika she paused for a moment before taking her heart into her hands once again and restating her question.</p>
<p>"Annika my love?now that you know what I am asking will you consent to be joined with me for life?"</p>
<p>There were tears in Annika's eyes and she could barely find her voice to speak.  Finally she had to settle for nodding and a whispered </p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Even though she had been expecting Annika to say yes B'Elanna still could not believe her luck.</p>
<p>"Yes...You said yes did you not or are my ears deceived by the strength of my hope?"</p>
<p>"Your ears do not deceive you my love?I assure you that I did indeed say yes."</p>
<p>"Yes?YES!"</p>
<p>B'Elanna placed the ring on Annika's finger before sweeping her love up in her arms and spinning her wildly in circles.  She let the Lady's body slide down along her own until their lips met in a kiss of surpassing tenderness and passion.  Annika's feet had still not touched the ground and her heart itself had taken wings.  When B'Elanna finally set Annika back on the ground she continued to hold her fiercely in her arms; afraid that should she let her go the dream would end and she would find herself alone.  Annika rested her head on the powerful shoulders of her love and reveled in the feeling of being pressed so close to the woman she adored.  Time ceased to have meaning for them and it was several moments before either of them moved.</p>
<p>When they finally moved apart, Annika was surprised to see the joy so clearly displayed on the face of the normally reserved young warrior.  B'Elanna could barely contain herself and she found herself talking and laughing much more than was her custom.  She finally had to express herself in her preferred medium, the physical, by sweeping Annika off her feet and into her arms, carrying her off toward their camp. They were both oblivious to the amused or envious looks that were directed their way by the others that they passed.  There were both too wrapped up in their own world, which in these moments had contracted until it encompassed only the two of them.  Once again Annika marveled at the strength in her love's arms as B'Elanna carried her effortlessly back to their camp.</p>
<p>Tom, Harry and Kate were all sitting by the fire awaiting the arrival of their two friends.  Only Harry truly knew how important the evening was to B'Elanna, but the others had sensed that something was in the air and so had opted to stick close to the camp for the evening in order not to miss whatever it was that was about to happen.  When they observed B'Elanna approaching the camp with Annika in her arms they were at first concerned that something might have happened to the Lady, but the sound of laughter soon set their minds at ease.  They walked out to meet the laughing couple and were rewarded by hearing the two young women talking at once and at lightning speed as they tried to share their happiness with their friends.</p>
<p>When they all calmed down and were settled by the fire, Harry brought out a flagon of mead that he had brought back to the camp for the occasion and they all took turns toasting the happy couple.  B'Elanna once again explained how it was that they could be married in a formal ceremony.  Although it was unorthodox everyone knew how important it was for both B'Elanna and Annika to feel that their love and their union was celebrated with a ceremony and so they accepted the plan with unequivocal happiness.  They sat around the fire for over an hour making plans and dreaming out loud of the future.  Since they were skipping the next tournament there was no need to be on the road particularly early in the morning and so they stayed up talking and scheming until late into the night.</p>
<p>They awoke later than usual and had a leisurely breakfast in the now practically empty tournament grounds before tearing down camp and heading out on the road in a different direction from the rest of the competitors.  Because her mind was not on the tournament for a change B'Elanna found herself talking and joking more with her friends than was normal for her.  For the first time Tom and Kate were getting a chance to see what Harry had known all along, that being that B'Elanna was actually a much more funny and gregarious individual than they had previously suspected.  B'Elanna was having more fun than she had in a long time as she got to know the newest members of her 'family' better.</p>
<p>They had a long leisurely day of riding, B'Elanna was relieved to see that Annika and Kate were adjusting well to life on the road?they seemed less uncomfortable than before and even seemed to be enjoying themselves.  </p>
<p>They stopped for the evening relatively early and only Harry was surprised to see Annika immediately change into more comfortable clothing and begin to help setting up the camp.  With all of the help they had this evening it was no problem for them to set up the tent completely.  Tom and Harry were even energetic enough to pick up their bows and go hunting for some fresh meat for dinner.  Kate gathered up wood and began brewing tea and roasting potatoes in the coals to go along with whatever Tom and Harry managed to get for dinner.</p>
<p>When they were coming back to the camp with the pheasants they had brought down with their bows, Tom was watching Harry carefully for his reaction to the scene that Tom was almost certain would greet them.  He was not disappointed when Harry stopped dead in his tracks with his mouth wide open at the sight of Annika and B'Elanna fencing in the clearing near the fire.</p>
<p>"What?" was all he managed to get out as he continued to stare at the improbable scene before his eyes.</p>
<p>"I know?it is really quite a sight isn't it."</p>
<p>Harry smiled finally and shook his head.</p>
<p>"Sometimes I think we are living in a completely different world from everyone else my friend.  I fear for the day when B'Elanna decides that I should wear a dress and act as her handmaiden and not her squire."</p>
<p>Tom couldn't help but smile at the picture Harry's words evoked in his mind.</p>
<p>"And what will you say if that day comes Harry?"</p>
<p>"Well, you've seen her in the sword ring Tom?I'll say 'Yes my Lord' and hope she picks out a dress in my colour."</p>
<p>Tom slapped Harry on the back as the two men laughed uproariously and continued their walk into camp to prepare dinner for the group.  The irony of this fact was not lost on them.</p>
<p>Harry and B'Elanna had worked out the timing of this journey to perfection.  They would leave in the early morning the next day and arrive just outside of their destination by late afternoon.  This would allow time for everyone to bathe and dress for the ceremony that would take place that very evening.  Harry had arranged a surprise or two for the couple that he was very proud of, and he was looking forward to this occasion almost as much as B'Elanna.  He realized that his life would look slightly different once B'Elanna was married to Annika.  He would miss the closeness they had shared up until now, but was truly happy for his friend.</p>
<p>When everyone went to sleep B'Elanna and Harry remained sitting by the fire and talking softly.  Harry tried to express his joy at B'Elanna's happiness, and B'Elanna for her part talked openly about her hopes and even her fears as she prepared to take the most important step of her life.  She was afraid that Annika would not be able to withstand the rigours of a life spent on the road, and that eventually she would want to have a different kind of life.  B'Elanna realized that her life as a champion could not last forever.  Eventually she would have to find something different to do with her life; she would be forced to find a new way to make a living.  She knew that she had saved enough money to live comfortably for some time, and that if they were smart with the money she won over the next few years that they could have comfortable and simple life for some time.  But a simple life was not what she wanted to offer to Annika.  Lady Hansart deserved so much more than merely a 'comfortable' life, but B'Elanna was uncertain as to how she could ever possibly provide it for her.  With no land and no home to offer, her choices were limited.  </p>
<p>Harry knew that B'Elanna's fears were grounded in reality, but he also knew that Annika was deeply in love with his friend and that she was not longing for a life of leisure nearly as much as B'Elanna feared. However, he shared B'Elanna's concerns as to what would happen to them when the day came that his friend could no longer compete in the tournaments.  For this evening however, he merely encouraged her to concentrate on the joys the next few days would bring and put aside her more material worries.</p>
<p>Eventually the two of them talked themselves out and they were content to sit in silence and enjoy the fire.  When Harry finally said that he felt it was time for bed, B'Elanna asked him to bring their bedrolls out by the fire.  He was only too happy to comply and for the last time ever the two friends rolled up in their blankets beside the fire and fell asleep beneath the stars.</p>
<p>Everyone was up early the next morning and the camp was buzzing with excitement as they packed and prepared for the relatively short journey to their destination.  B'Elanna found herself feeling rather shy around Annika this morning for some reason, and so she kept to herself while they tore down the camp and had a quick breakfast before setting out on the road.  She trusted Harry with her life but was still worried as to whether or not all of the arrangements for the ceremony would meet her exacting demands.  She had given him instructions down to the finest detail and driven him crazy by going over her wishes again and again until he assured her he knew what she wanted.  Even so, as she rode to the village her mind kept wandering over everything that could possibly go wrong.  </p>
<p>She was lost in thought and so didn't notice Annika dropping back to ride beside her.</p>
<p>"Is everything alright my love?" she asked.  She could see the worry on B'Elanna's face and although she knew that the young warrior loved her very much she was concerned that she might be having second thoughts about solidifying their relationship with a marriage ceremony.</p>
<p>B'Elanna shook herself out of her reverie and saw the look of concern on Annika's face.  She knew instantly that Annika was feeling insecure and she hastened to reassure her that everything was all right.</p>
<p>"I am fine my love?I?I just want everything to be perfect."  In truth she was still worrying over what was to become of them and desperately trying to figure out what to do with her life, but she was not ready to discuss any of these worries with Annika just yet.  She didn't wish to burden her bride-to-be with such mundane matters.  She really did want the entire day to be perfect for her love.</p>
<p>Annika urged her horse closer to B'Elanna's and reached out to take the hand of her warrior.</p>
<p>"Things are always perfect when we are together my beloved.  I never knew what life could be like until I met you.  I thought I was living and that I was content, even happy with my place in the world?it was not until I fell in love with you that I understood what it means to truly live.  I can't imagine anything more perfect than being allowed to live my life together with you.  So have no concern for mere details; we have already achieved perfection?tonight is a celebration of that perfection?not a means by which to achieve it."</p>
<p>B'Elanna could not believe her ears as Annika so accurately put into words everything she was feeling about their relationship.  She could not stop a tear from escaping the bounds of her control and tracking down her cheek.</p>
<p>"I love you Lady Hansart?I don't understand what miracle of fate brought you to my life, but I give thanks for it with every breath I draw and I will continue to do so until I breathe my last."</p>
<p>It didn't seem that either of them trusted themselves to speak after such an uncharacteristic display of emotion, and so they rode on in silence, still holding hands, content in knowing that they no longer needed words to share their feelings for one another?every touch and every look spoke eloquent volumes about their love.</p>
<p>They rode thusly together until they reached their camp.  The whole group hurried to set up the tent before eating a very quick meal and taking turns walking down to the river to bathe in preparation for the evening.  Annika and Kate retired to one half of the tent to dress the Lady for the ceremony while Harry and B'Elanna commandeered the other side for B'Elanna's preparations.  Tom took charge of the horses, getting the tangles out of their manes and tails and currying their coats until they shone. He then unpacked the first of Harry's surprises and finished saddling the horses before he went to bathe for the ceremony.</p>
<p>B'Elanna had a gift to give to Annika to wear at the ceremony and so she asked Harry to give it to Kate in order that Annika not be disturbed in her preparations. As for her clothing for the evening she had trusted Harry to purchase her clothes and she was not disappointed when she unpacked the costume he had chosen for her to wear this night.  </p>
<p>Finally she was dressed and had nothing else to do but to wait until Annika was ready and they could all depart for the ceremony.  She paced restlessly around her half of the tent, fiddling with the fit of her clothing, tying and retying the sash around her waist.  Finally Harry informed her that Annika was ready and that it was time to go.  She took several deep, calming breaths before she stepped out of the tent to greet her future.</p>
