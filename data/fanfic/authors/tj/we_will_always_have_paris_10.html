<!-- We'll Always Have Paris \ Chapter 10: Epilogue -->

<p>It seemed to take longer this year to walk the distance to the rockface at the end of the trail, but they had made it together.  They walked hand in hand like young lovers always do.</p>

<p>"It reminds me of the rock on Kintari where we went climbing with Dartak."</p>

<p>"You were magnificent that day my love."</p>

<p>"Does that mean you don't think I'm magnificent any longer."</p>

<p>Seven ran her fingers through the pure white hair of her lover.  "You will always be magnificent to me, but I do not suggest you attempt to scale the rock today."</p>

<p>"It's been a long time, I may have forgotten a move or two I suppose."</p>

<p>"You still have all the right moves as far as I'm concerned," Seven smiled lovingly at the woman she had spent her life with.  She drew the beautiful Klingon into her arms and they kissed lovingly as they so often did.</p>

<p>"Ahh gee, are you at it again.  You never stop do you?"  She never tired of teasing her mothers about their undying affection for one another.  Their love had stood the test of time untarnished and they were as physically affectionate with one another now as they had been forty years ago on the day of their marriage.</p>

<p>"And we never will Kate, we never will."</p>
