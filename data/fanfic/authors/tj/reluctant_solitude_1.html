<!-- A Reluctant Solitude \ Part 1 -->

<p>Seven of Nine was slowly going insane.  Since the crew had been put into stasis in order to protect them from the nebula's radiation she had been almost completely alone. She had struggled with hearing only her own voice in her mind since her separation from the collective, but this was far worse.  </p>

		<p>Much as she had struggled with integration into Voyager's crew she found that what she had once deemed inefficient and annoying was now essential.  She couldn't stand to be alone with her thoughts for this long-she needed the distraction and companionship of her crewmates to thrive.  She was dismayed at that thought, but nevertheless with each day that passed she knew it to be more and more true.</p>

		<p>The doctor had started to get on her nerves after only a few days.  Where once she found him helpful and even charming, now she found him cloying and annoying.  The feeling seemed to be mutual and had his program not begun to degrade requiring that he be taken offline until they cleared the nebula, they would have continued to avoid one another wherever possible.  The corridors of the ship seemed to mock her as moved from place to place carrying out her self-imposed routine.  She had thought that the logic and order of a work schedule would help alleviate the stress of solitude, but now she wondered if it wasn't only making it worse.</p>

		<p>When she heard the hail from the alien ship she had thought her salvation was at hand.  She had never thought that she would be excited at the prospect of making first contact with an alien species, but she had been thrilled when the stranger had made his request for parts and assistance.  It meant that their contact would provide a distraction for a more prolonged period of time.  How quickly it had turned into a nightmare.  The alien had begun terrorizing her almost immediately and the worst part was that she still didn't know how much of the encounter had been real, and how much had been the product of her own delusions.  She began to worry that she would be unable to maintain her sanity until Voyager cleared the nebula.  She MUST persevere, the crew, her new collective, were counting on her.</p>

		<p>She felt the person she was slipping away.  She hadn't really taken the time to appreciate what it meant to be an individual--a person--and now it appeared to be too late.  She clenched her hands into fists so tight that the palm of her fully human hand began to bleed from the pressure.  She needed to concentrate!  She needed to remain focussed on the task at hand or Voyager and its crew would perish.  She needed to maintain her humanity but she had no idea how to do so in the face of her steadily increasing psychosis.</p>

		<p>"I am Seven of Nine Tertiary Adjunct to Unimatrix Zero One," she repeated...her voice growing louder as she desperately tried to remind herself of who and what she was.  "No!  I am Seven of Nine, Astrometrics officer of the Federation Starship Voyager.  I am Seven...I am not One, not alone...I am Seven."</p>

		<p>Despite her best efforts her sanity, her ability to function, continued to slip away.  The harder she tried to hold on, the worse it was.  Then the crew began to appear around her.  Not her friends and acquaintances as she knew them, but rather angry, jeering visions of radiation burned crewmates who blamed and ridiculed her as she worked to repair the ship's failing systems.  They said the most hurtful things to her-things she had only ever said to herself in her darkest moments.  Her self-loathing and her deepest insecurities were feeding off the words and images of the people she had come to care about.</p>

		<p>"Shut up!" she yelled, spinning around to face her tormentors.</p>

		<p>They were all there: the captain, Chakotay, Paris and Kim, even Tuvok was taunting her with looks and words.  At first she thought Lieutenant Torres was absent, but upon closer inspection she saw the half-Klingon standing at the back of the bridge, half in shadow.  Her face was marred by the radiation just like the rest of the crew.  She stood, hipsprung with her arms crossed, a familiar half-smile on her lips.  At first glance Seven was certain the smile was a derisive one, but when she looked more closely the smile appeared friendly, almost encouraging.  The rest of the crew continued to mock her while B'Elanna stood silently-observing.  Just when Seven reached her breaking point, unable to stabilize the warp core containment field and reinitialize the engines, unable to block the sounds of her 'friends' voices, B'Elanna suddenly spoke.</p>

		<p>"You can do it Seven-just concentrate."</p>

		<p>Seven closed her eyes tightly, then reopened them slowly.  The room was empty; there was nobody there.  She returned to her task and to her relief after a further 30 minutes of work the field was stabilized and the core came back on line.  She made the course corrections and set the ship back on its path to the edge of the nebula.</p>

		<p>She breathed a sigh of relief and began to complete her self-imposed rounds.  Midway through she could no longer stop herself from deviating from her carefully planned route.  She found herself in the cargo bay where all of the stasis tubes were located.  She made her way to Lt. Torres' stasis tube.  She gazed down into the peaceful face of the Chief Engineer.  In repose, she seemed much younger than the force of nature she had come to know as B'Elanna Torres.  She touched her hand to the Plexan casing of the tube, wishing it were the engineer's face she was touching, but knowing that if she were awake the fiery Klingon would not welcome the touch of a drone.  She laid her cheek on the cool surface, her mind clear and calm at last.  She smiled slightly at the sight of B'Elanna's stuffed Targ tucking out of sight down by her hands.  Seven began to appreciate that beneath B'Elanna's tough exterior she was as full of fears and doubts as everyone else trapped here in the Delta quadrant.</p>

		<p>"Thank you B'Elanna," she whispered.</p>

		<p>Sighing, Seven stood upright and forced herself to leave the cargo bay and continue on her rounds.  She heard a sound and turned her head to find B'Elanna keeping pace with her as she walked.  The engineer stayed with her as she worked, never speaking, but always offering a comforting presence to Seven in her agitated state.  The last thing that Seven saw before her regeneration cycle began was the figure of B'Elanna Torres settling down on the dais, to watch over her as she slept.</p>

		<p>From that day on Seven spent at least a portion of everyday in the cargo bay 'talking' to B'Elanna.  She told her of her difficulties in keeping the engines running, and of her fears that she would not be able to keep control of her mind long enough to get Voyager clear of the nebula.  She took comfort in her closeness to the beautiful engineer and longed wistfully for the impossible.  That when the crew was again awake that somehow she and B'Elanna would become close.  She knew the engineer was involved with Tom Paris, but she had often observed that the couple was ill suited for one another.  </p>

		<p>"You deserve someone stronger and more honourable, someone who can love you with their entire being the way you should be loved, not someone who will make you feel that you are second in his affections to the holodeck."  She paused for a long moment as she gazed at the face of the one she had come to think of as her saviour.  "I would be that person."</p>

		<p>She straightened up and prepared for her rounds.  Her mind had been much calmer the last few days, and the edge of the nebula was close, but Voyager's systems continued to break down with increasing regularity.  She was worried that all of the patches and bypasses she had created would not be enough to carry the starship through to the other side.  If too many more systems and gel packs malfunctioned there would be nothing left to bypass with.  However, she knew she had to keep trying.  She spent the day rerouting power from every non-essential system left running, and still it might not be enough.  The engines were constantly on the edge of stalling out, and her crewmates had returned to taunt her with her imminent failure.  She had to make a decision, the crew or herself.  She deactivated the life support to the stasis tubes and the engines came back on line-the edge of the nebula was in sight.  The crewmembers appeared to her again tormenting her, accusing her of being responsible for their deaths, of sacrificing them to save her own life, the figure of B'Elanna appeared and walked through the darkened room toward her.</p>

		<p>"I trust you Seven-with my life."</p>

		<p>Seven made the only possible decision upon hearing the engineer's words.  She deactivated the life support on the ship and restored power to the stasis tubes.  The doctor would come on line the second they cleared the nebula and he would be able to revive the crew.  She would perish, but it was worth it if B'Elanna would live.  As she sank into unconsciousness she was still able to hear the torments of the Captain and Chakotay as they watched her die. </p>

		<p>She awoke in sick bay several hours later.  Her plan had been successful and the crew had come through the ordeal unscathed, unknowing of what she had been through, what she had been prepared to do on their behalf.  None of that mattered to her now that she knew her collective was safe.  Once she was released from sick bay she made her way back to Cargo Bay 2 for an extended period of regeneration.  She looked around the room, hoping illogically that B'Elanna would appear and again watch over her while she rested, but of course the Klingon never appeared.</p>
