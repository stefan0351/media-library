<!-- What the Heart Wants \ Chapter 3 -->

<p>The next few weeks were incredibly hectic aboard Voyager.  One or two minor skirmishes resulted in several days' worth of repairs.  Other than that B'Elanna dedicated herself to her project.  Seven was busy in Astrometrics but she came to engineering to help out whenever she could spare a moment.  Their working relationship had improved immensely.  They still argued, sometimes vehemently, but generally managed to come to a truce more quickly these days. They even managed to have dinner together in the messhall on two occasions while they went over schematics for the warp core upgrade.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was beginning to see the many different aspects of Seven, and to have a better appreciation for the depths of emotion that the younger woman possessed.  Over dinner one night they were discussing other crewmembers and Seven mentioned the obvious crush Ensign Kim had on her.  B'Elanna, always protective of Harry, began to bristle at the thought of Seven possibly hurting her young friend.  As they talked however, it became clear that Seven was herself worried about hurting the young operations officer.  She didn't return his feelings and was not sure how to dissuade his advances and still maintain what was, to her, an important affiliation.  She thought of Harry as a friend, but was afraid to interact freely with him in case she inadvertently led him to believe there could be more between them.  B'Elanna had had no idea that Seven could even feel that way, and she did her best to try to advise Seven about the situation, reassuring her that Harry's big heart would never hold a grudge if Seven was honest about not returning his feelings.</p>
<p>Finally the day came for testing the new refinements.  Seven had delegated all astrometrics duties to Ensign Celes in order to be available to assist B'Elanna in implementing her plan.  Harry was assigned to engineering for the day as well.  The initial testing phases went without a hitch, and by early afternoon they were ready bring the enhanced core online. </p>
<p>"Torres to Bridge."</p>
<p>"Go ahead B'Elanna," came the calm voice of commander Chakotay.  </p>
<p>"We're ready when you are."</p>
<p>"On your mark Lieutenant" replied Captain Janeway.</p>
<p>"Beginning startup sequence&#133;. now."</p>
<p>Seven was busy monitoring the output from the core, but she couldn't help watching the young engineer's face as her plan came to fruition.  The core came online without a hitch and Seven's advanced hearing could detect a smoother, slightly lower hum begin to emanate from the engines.  </p>
<p>"The sensor readings indicate that your modifications are exceeding your initial estimates by a factor of .021% Lieutenant," Seven said watching B'Elanna carefully for her reaction to the news.</p>
<p>B'Elanna smiled and closed her eyes "Hmm, I don't need the sensor output Seven, I can hear it in the engines.  They have a slightly lower sound to them now because they aren't doing as much work to utilize the dilithium."</p>
<p>Seven smiled, she liked the idea that of all the crew aboard Voyager only she and the fiery Klingon would be able to hear such a small variance in the engine output.  "Yes, there is a 1/16<sup>th</sup> % drop in the tone of the engine Lieutenant."</p>
<p>B'Elanna's grin widened&#133;"You can hear it too?"</p>
<p>"There are some advantages to my Borg physiology."</p>
<p>The Captain's voice came over the comm to congratulate B'Elanna on the success of the experiment.</p>
<p>"Thanks, but I couldn't have done it without Seven's help captain."  </p>
<p>"Well done all of you," came the reply "now keep an eye on the readings, we're going to put the old girl through her paces up here.  Ensign Kim please report back to the bridge&#133;We'll need you to monitor engine output from here. Janeway out."</p>
<p>For the rest of the day Paris and the bridge crew ran the engines as hard as they could, dropping in and out of warp quickly, accelerating and decelerating often.  By the end of the day, other than a few minor adjustments, the ship had performed above all estimations.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was ecstatic&#133;she was practically vibrating as they analyzed the last of the sensor data before going off shift.  "Thanks so much for your help Seven.  I meant what I said, I don't think this would have worked nearly as well without your input."</p>
<p>Seven was unused to the engineer being so effusive in her praise, so she was rather shy about replying. "I am honoured to have been included in your project Lieutenant."</p>
<p>B'Elanna couldn't contain herself.  "Call me B'Elanna will ya," she teased as she threw her arms around the former drone and pulled her into an enthusiastic hug.</p>
<p>Seven was alarmed at her body's response to the engineer's touch, her heart was pounding and her throat was dry.  She carefully moved her arms to encircle B'Elanna's waist, using all of her control not to crush the engineer too tightly. They stood like that for several seconds before B'Elanna began to feel awkward at her uncharacteristic display of emotion.  She pulled back gently from Seven's arms, "um, I guess we're done here then."</p>
<p>B'Elanna was feeling a bit disoriented after their embrace, and while a part of her wanted to get as far away from the statuesque blonde as possible, there was another part of her that wanted the closeness to continue.  "How about dinner in the messhall before the senior staff debriefing," she queried.</p>
<p>"Acceptable," Seven replied, still a bit flustered by the effects of the embrace.  </p>
<p>Dinner was a fun affair as several other crewmembers including Harry Kim joined them at their table to talk over the day's events.  Seven was disappointed as she had been hoping to have B'Elanna to herself, but she admitted that she was having fun being included in the friendly teasing and banter at the table.  She began to have a clearer understanding of B'Elanna's reasons for staying with the childish helmsman for so long.  She could see how happy B'Elanna was and she loved the way she threw back her head and laughed out loud when someone said something particularly amusing.  She was thrilling to watch.  B'Elanna for her part went out of her way to ensure that Seven was included in the fun and was obliged to see both her blush and her shy smile on several occasions when the friendly teasing was directed at her.  In the end they were all reluctant to end the meal as the time for the staff debriefing drew near.</p>
<p>The meeting was technical in nature with all departments reporting on any reactions to the change in the engine configurations.  All feedback was generally positive and the senior crewmembers spent the rest of the meeting going over the data from the tests.  The captain was anxious to keep the meeting brief, as she knew how hard they had all worked that day during the testing phase of the project.  </p>
<p>Once the data had been thoroughly analyzed she stood up, clearing her throat. "If there is no other business I believe we can call it a night."</p>
<p>"Actually Captain," Tom Paris spoke up, "I was thinking that since we all worked so hard and this project was such a success, maybe we should have a crew party in the messhall&#133;you know, sort of a 'job well done' affair.  Food, drink, dancing, that kind of thing." </p>
<p>B'Elanna snorted at the thought of Tom Paris working hard, but she bit back any comment that would earn her a reprimand or a Force 10 glare from her Captain.</p>
<p>The Captain appeared to consider the request briefly, and gave her permission for the party only after ascertaining from Seven that there was nothing 'troublesome' on long range sensors at this time.</p>
<p>Neelix rubbed his hands together gleefully as there was nothing he liked more than planning a good party, and frankly he felt Seven and B'Elanna deserved some kind of recognition for all of their hard work.  The hard part for him would be convincing both of them to attend.  Nevertheless he promised 'a night to remember' in just three days time, and set off to the messhall to begin planning the party.</p>
<p>As predicted, neither Seven nor B'Elanna planned to attend the affair.  B'Elanna was reluctant to go, as she knew that Tom and any number of female crewmembers would be there, and she didn't feel like being reminded again of her rejection at the hands of the helmsman.  Seven was simply uncomfortable at the thought of interacting with so many crewmembers and so covered by declaring the social occasion 'irrelevant.'  </p>
<p>Neelix was well aware that the crew thought of him, albeit fondly, as a bit of a buffoon.  He knew they valued his contributions as morale officer, and he knew he was well liked in general, (He had no idea, however, how the crew truly viewed his abilities as a chef) but he also knew he was very rarely taken seriously. This was a mistake on the part of the crew. Neelix was in fact one of the most consistently underestimated members of Voyager's crew.  He could clearly see the change in Seven's relationship to B'Elanna over the past few weeks and he couldn't have been happier.  He was determined to make sure that they both attended the party, and he ascertained, quite correctly, that Seven would be the easiest to convince.  In fact, if he did his job right Seven might well be the one to convince Lieutenant Torres to attend.</p>
<p>He chose his time carefully and made his way to Cargo Bay 2, ostensibly to perform yet another inventory of ship's stores.  As he predicted Seven was alone in the bay working on her console.  Neelix gave her a cheery hello and was gratified to receive a rare smile in return.  </p>
<p>"So, Seven, what are you up to this evening," he asked?</p>
<p>"I am rechecking the sensor data from yesterday's test," Seven replied.</p>
<p>"An excellent job on both of your part's, it will be a relief not to have to search for dilithium quite so frequently from here on in."  Neelix paused for effect and then sighed heavily and said, almost to himself "It does seem like a shame about B'Elanna though."</p>
<p>He was surprised at the vehemence in the normally emotionless drone's voice when she demanded, "what has happened to B'Elanna, perhaps I should see if she requires assistance."</p>
<p>"No, no&#133;she's fine&#133;its just&#133;well, really this party is in her honour, and I know she doesn't feel comfortable attending.  You know Klingon's, never comfortable with public recognition."  Neelix knew he was winging it here and he only hoped that Seven's concern over B'Elanna would stop her from catching him in his fabrications.  </p>
<p>"I suppose that Tom Paris's plan to attend with not one, but both of the Delaney twins is adding to her discomfort.  It's a shame&#133;I think she really deserves the thanks of the crew, and a chance to show Mr. Paris that she has recovered from their break up.  I'm just afraid if she doesn't go she'll feel her honour has been further damaged."  Neelix knew he should quit while he was ahead.  He'd laid it on pretty thick, and all he could do now was hope Seven would take the bait.  He sighed once more and pretended to begin his inventory.</p>
<p>Neelix was gratified to see Seven staring off into space for a few moments, and then turning to leave the holodeck with a very determined look on her face.  'B'Elanna doesn't stand a chance' he chuckled to himself.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was relaxing on her couch reading a holonovel when the chime to her door sounded.  "Come in," she said wondering who could be stopping by.</p>
<p>She was surprised to see the figure of Seven of Nine in her doorway.</p>
<p>"Hey Seven, what's up?"</p>
<p>Seven glanced at the ceiling for a moment before remembering that this was another one of those 'figures of speech' she had so much trouble with.  "I was wondering what you planned to wear to the party," Seven queried.  On her way here in the turbolift she had come up with this ruse to find out if B'Elanna was planning on attending the party without giving away too much of her personal interest in the matter.  She was terribly proud of herself&#133;truly the doctor's social lessons were beginning to pay off.</p>
<p>B'Elanna raised an eyebrow at that&#133;Seven was interested in fashion&#133;she didn't think so.  Nevertheless she replied "actually I'm not planning on going Seven. Parties aren't really my thing. Besides I don't really want to see Tom hanging all over his 'tart du jour'."</p>
<p>Seven had no idea why a French dessert would stop B'Elanna from attending the party, but she didn't have time to worry about that now&#133;her new friend's honour was at stake.</p>
<p>"I am sorry you will not be attending.  I was looking forward to the occasion, but if you are not going I believe I will stay away as well."  Seven had also worked out in the Turbolift that the quickest way to get B'Elanna to attend was to make her think that she would be helping out a friend by doing so.</p>
<p>"What does my not going to the party have to do with you Seven," B'Elanna was truly curious?</p>
<p>"I am uncomfortable in large crowds, and I am unsure of how to 'mingle' and 'make small talk.' I was counting on your presence to reassure me.  I just thought it would be nice to have a friend in the crowd."</p>
<p>B'Elanna was touched at the drone's admission, but still didn't really want to go to the party.</p>
<p>"Thanks Seven, but to tell the truth, I'm not really good at that stuff either, so I'm not sure how much help I'd be."</p>
<p>Seven frowned and did her best to look inordinately sad.  "I suppose I thought we could support each other.  Perhaps if we only talked to one another it would be less difficult."  She felt her logic was flawless in this matter.</p>
<p>"Seven, if we're only going to talk to each other why go to the party.  We could just stay here," B'Elanna countered.</p>
<p>This was clearly going to be more difficult than Seven had imagined.  She carefully lowered her head and looked up at B'Elanna through her eyelashes, a tactic she had witnessed Naomi Wildman use to great effect on her mother on numerous occasions.  "It is just that I had so much fun with you and your friends at dinner last night&#133;I thought it would be fun to have a chance to interact in such a way again. But if you do not wish to attend the party I would be happy to stay and talk to you here."  'This had better work,' Seven thought to herself because frankly she was out of ideas.</p>
<p>"OK, OK.  If it means that much to you Seven of course I'll go to the party." B'Elanna promptly caved upon witnessing her first ever full-blown Borg pout.  "So that's what they mean by 'resistance is futile,'" she joked.</p>
<p>Seven smiled broadly at her success and, mission accomplished, turned to go after thanking B'Elanna for agreeing to go to the party.</p>
<p>"Hang on Seven, I thought you wanted to know what I was wearing?"</p>
<p>Seven froze, caught in her own deception she panicked and began to babble "Oh, yes of course, well whatever you wear will be wonderful I am sure, I am just glad that you'll be going.  I really must regenerate now&#133;. Goodnight Lieutenant Torres."  With that she was gone and B'Elanna once again found herself staring at the inside of her door.  'We really do not do well with good-byes,' she thought to herself.</p>
<p>Two days later, promptly at 1900 hours, B'Elanna showed up at Cargo Bay 2 to meet Seven for the party.  She had chosen to wear the same black pants as she had the night Seven came for dinner, and was also wearing a dark green silk shirt that looked wonderful with her skin tones.  Seven was working at her console updating her personal logs.  She turned to observe B'Elanna and caught her breath at the site of the young engineer in her civilian clothes.  "You look wonderful Lieutenant Torres."</p>
<p>"I really thought you were going to work on calling me B'Elanna."</p>
<p>"I apologize, B'Elanna, I was distracted by your appearance."</p>
<p>"You look nice as well Seven."  In truth Seven was wearing one of her ubiquitous biosuits, but this one was black and the young woman looked quite lovely.  "Shall we go."</p>
<p>They walked in silence to the turbolift and smiled at the two junior crewmen who were already on board, obviously on their way to the party as well.</p>
<p>They lingered behind the younger crewmen until they were at the doors to the messhall.  "Well, here we go," B'Elanna smiled up at Seven as they prepared to enter the room.</p>
<p>They pushed through the doors and were immediately assaulted by the sights, sounds, and smells of a typical Voyager party.  There were lots of people there already and both Seven and B'Elanna were secretly relieved that there was no sign of Tom Paris as yet.</p>
<p>Neelix smiled to himself as he saw the two friends enter the room, and he hustled over to get them a drink.  They were happy to see the cheerful Talaxian and spent several minutes chatting with him after he fetched drinks for them both.  </p>
<p>They stuck close together as they drifted around the party so Seven was aware of B'Elanna's reaction when Tom Paris arrived with a Delaney on either arm.  The young Klingon stiffened as she realized that Paris had brought two dates to the party. She watched him laughing and talking with them and other members of the crew.  She was mortified when Tom caught her staring at him and leaned over to kiss Megan, never taking his eyes off B'Elanna to be sure she was watching.  She was angry with herself that she felt a lump forming in her throat and tears welling up in her eyes.  She didn't even like the guy, why should she care who he kissed.  She was self aware enough to realize that she didn't, in fact, care who he kissed, but rather she missed the physical affection that a relationship afforded.  She always felt so alone and somehow untouchable and Tom seemed determined to show her he knew it.</p>
<p>She was, therefore, a little shocked when she heard Seven laugh loudly and felt the young woman throw her arm around B'Elanna's shoulders.  Seven then proceeded to tell a story about something B'Elanna had done last week that she had found particularly amusing.  She exaggerated wildly and pretty soon the whole group was laughing and teasing B'Elanna.  B'Elanna was grateful for the reprieve and happier still to see the look of annoyance on Tom's face when he realized she was actually having fun.  The strange thing was that she was also enjoying the feeling of the arm Seven had left draped around her shoulders.  She tilted her head back and leaned close to Seven's ear whispering a heartfelt "thank you."  Seven felt a tremor course through her body as she felt the engineer's breath on her skin.  She hugged B'Elanna closer, smiling as she replied, "I told you we would support each other." </p>
<p>B'Elanna was sorry when eventually Seven removed her arm, but happy that the two of them were getting along so well tonight.  She was glad to see Harry finally arrive and make his way toward the group.  </p>
<p>Seven was also happy to see the young ensign and so was unprepared when he asked her to dance just as a slow song began playing.  She didn't want to hurt his feelings but was unsure enough about her ability to extricate herself from this situation that she stammered.  "I am sorry Ensign Kim, but I promised this dance to Lieutenant Torres, umm, B'Elanna."</p>
<p>B'Elanna nearly dropped her drink when she heard Seven tell an outright lie.  She didn't want to hurt Harry's feelings though so she took Seven's hand and led her out onto the dance floor.   "What the hell do you think you're doing" B'Elanna hissed as they began to slowly circle the dance floor, angry at Seven's apparent disregard for Harry's feelings.  "I am sorry," Seven replied.  "I panicked&#133;I did not wish to hurt his feelings but I was afraid to accept his offer in case he mistook my acceptance for encouragement. I fear I have hurt Harry and angered you as well."  B'Elanna felt her anger fade as she saw that Seven was once again on the verge of tears.  "Hey, it's ok&#133;I understand, but you really need to be honest with Harry or you will wreck your friendship with him."</p>
<p>Seven nodded, and visibly relaxed when she noticed Harry already dancing with someone else.  As she began to calm down she suddenly became vividly aware that she was being held in B'Elanna's arms.  Once again her chest constricted and her heartrate increased, the feeling of the lithe young Klingon's body pressed so close to hers made feel giddy and out of control.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna herself was surprised at her reactions to finding herself dancing with Voyager's resident Borg.  Seven was moving gracefully in B'Elanna's arms and as she relaxed into the dance she lowered her cheek to rest on B'Elanna's brow ridges.  B'Elanna was embarrassed to feel her palms begin to sweat as they danced.  'Oh well,' she thought to herself, 'I'm sure Seven won't understand what it means anyway.'  The truth was B'Elanna was enjoying holding Seven in her arms.  The younger woman's body was firm and athletic, B'Elanna was well aware of just how powerful Seven was, and it was a rush to be holding that power so close.  She unconsciously drew Seven closer as she moved her around the dance floor.  </p>
<p>When the song ended B'Elanna was reluctant to let go of the beautiful young woman, so she merely leaned back in her arms and asked if she wanted to continue dancing.  She was surprised to see that Seven's eyes had been closed.  The young Borg appeared almost dazed as she readily agreed to another dance.  </p>
<p>They danced several more songs without speaking, both just reveling in the feeling of being held.  When the tempo of the music increased they both reluctantly drifted apart and went back to join their friends.  No one seemed to care that the two former adversaries had been dancing so closely and the mood remained light and jovial.  When the music again slowed Seven looked expectantly at B'Elanna and found to her delight that the Engineer was looking back at her.  Just as she was about to ask B'Elanna to dance again she found Harry at her side.  This time when he asked her to dance she graciously accepted and they stepped out onto the dance floor.  B'Elanna was shocked to hear herself growl softly at the sight of 'her' drone in the arms of someone else.  'Ok Torres, get a grip here, she's not YOUR drone,' she chided herself, but she couldn't help staring as they danced.</p>
<p>She was still watching Harry and Seven dance when she heard Tom Paris's voice in her ear.  "So the best you could do for a date was the Borg and now you've lost her to Harry," he mocked.  </p>
<p>"Look flyboy piss off before you get hurt," she growled.  </p>
<p>Paris couldn't see the danger he was in so he kept pressing his luck, "so, if you're going to fuck the borg do you need any special equipment&#133;I see you don't have your tool box with you this evening.  Although I must say I'm not surprised that you would find a way to date a machine."</p>
<p>B'Elanna's entire body was shaking with her losing effort to control her anger.  She moved toward Tom, who, upon realizing his danger, was now in full retreat.  Just as she was about to take a swing at the helmsman she felt herself lifted off the ground by a strong arm encircling her waist.  At that moment Harry brushed by her, and, grabbing Tom by the shoulders moved him away from the angry Klingon.</p>
<p>"Honestly, I cannot leave you alone for a moment without you getting into trouble," Seven's soft voice whispered in her ear, as the taller woman carefully set B'Elanna back down on the ground.</p>
<p>At the sound of Seven's voice B'Elanna relaxed visibly and even managed a wan smile.  "Looks like this is the second time you've kept me out of the brig," she laughed.  "Seriously, thanks&#133;I was about to tear him apart."</p>
<p>"He is not worth the trouble, and nothing he says about you could possibly be true; you should learn to ignore him," Seven advised.</p>
<p>"I don't care what he says about me, but when he insults&#133;" B'Elanna let her voice trail off as she realized she didn't want Seven to hear the hurtful things Tom had said about her.</p>
<p>"I see, you were defending my honour is that it," Seven demanded?</p>
<p>"Look, let's just forget it OK," B'Elanna pleaded.</p>
<p>"I wish to know what he said about me."   B'Elanna remained silent for a moment,  "Comply" Seven demanded again.</p>
<p>"Look he just made an asinine crack about me needing a tool box to&#133;. I mean&#133;if we were to be&#133;um&#133;He just said he figured I would finally find a way to date a machine," B'Elanna finished lamely.</p>
<p>Seven understood exactly what Tom had said, and her eyes were sad as she told B'Elanna "this is not the first time a member of the crew has made a comment to that effect about me, and I am certain it will not be the last."</p>
<p>"What&#133;who else said that&#133;I'll take 'em apart with my Bat'leth&#133;who else Seven&#133;I want to know."</p>
<p>"It does not matter B'Elanna."</p>
<p>"It does to me."</p>
<p>"I am gratified that you hold my honour in such high regard, but you yourself have often made comments about my being a machine in the past."</p>
<p>This time it was B'Elanna who was on the verge of tears.  "I'm so sorry Seven&#133;can you ever forgive me for being such a P'Taq."</p>
<p>"Do you still believe that I am a machine without emotions," Seven asked timidly?</p>
<p>"Of course not, you are a beautiful young woman, and you are my friend. I'm really sorry if behaved in anyway to make you doubt that," was B'Elanna's heartfelt answer.</p>
<p>"You find me beautiful?" Seven's eyes were wide with wonder.</p>
<p>'How do I get myself into these messes' B'Elanna wondered to herself as Seven waited for an answer to her question.   "Um, Yes&#133;I think you are beautiful," B'Elanna settled for the unvarnished truth hoping that would be the end of it.  She wasn't ready to analyze what in the world had prompted her to say such a thing in the first place. Lucky for her they were interrupted by Harry coming back after having hustled Tom out of harm's way.</p>
<p>The party was winding down now, and so they finished their drinks and said goodnight to their friends.  B'Elanna was sure to thank Harry for his part in stopping the fight before it began.  Seven was disappointed that she did not get another chance to dance with B'Elanna, but was happy when the young Engineer offered to walk her back to the cargo bay after the party.</p>
<p>Once again they walked in amiable silence and upon reaching the door Seven turned to face B'Elanna.  "Thank you for attending the party with me B'Elanna.  I enjoyed our time together."</p>
<p>"As did I Seven, as did I" </p>
<p>They again found themselves caught in the moment of parting, unsure of what to do.  Finally B'Elanna stepped forward and pulled Seven into a hug, pressing her cheek to Seven's briefly as Seven hugged her back.  </p>
<p>"Goodnight Seven."</p>
<p>"Sweet dreams B'Elanna."</p>
<p>Seven turned and walked into the cargo bay.  She checked the ship's sensors quickly, fearful that Voyager's artificial gravity was failing&#133;she was certain that her feet hadn't touched the ground since B'Elanna had hugged her.  She was feeling lighter than air.  The sensors indicated that the artificial gravity was within established parameters so she quickly made another entry in her personal log and stepped into her alcove.  She paused for a moment to relive the feeling of dancing with B'Elanna and being held in her arms before she made contact with the regeneration unit and fell into her cycle.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was also feeling strangely elated as she walked back to her quarters.  She changed and crawled into bed.  She too replayed the night's events, both good and bad, in her head as she tried to sleep.  She couldn't stop thinking about what it had felt like to dance with Seven.  She tossed and turned fitfully for a long time before falling into a dreamless sleep.</p>
