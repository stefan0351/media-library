<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 2 -->

<p>When she reached the caves she tied the horses outside and moved quietly toward the back of the cavern.  She found the young Lord asleep beside the dying fire and gently shook him awake.</p>
<p>"Lord Kim, wake up, we need to get going.  We aren't going to be safe here for long."</p>
<p>He opened up his bloodshot eyes and looked at her with incomprehension.</p>
<p>"Harry, listen to me?I need you to stand up and come with me?.do you understand."</p>
<p>Finally her words seemed to sink in and he followed obediently as she led the way out of the caves.  It was the middle of the night, but B'Elanna wanted to put as much distance between herself and Kim manor as she could before they stopped to rest.  There was no telling whether or not the mob would let them go or decide to pursue them once they realized she had been back to the house and taken the horses.</p>
<p>Trusting to the animals to pick their way safely through the dark, B'Elanna gave the horses their heads and pulled some of the bread out of the sack she had procured.  She urged Harry to eat and he obediently chewed on the bread.  B'Elanna knew he was in shock after everything that he had been through tonight, and the truth was she wanted nothing more than to curl up into a ball and cry like a child, but her survival instinct was driving her now, and so she forced herself and the bereft young man to keep moving through the night.</p>
<p>B'Elanna woke with a start as her limp body hit the ground.  She shook her head to clear the cobwebs and realized that she must have fallen asleep astride the horse and only now fallen off.  The horse was standing patiently nearby and she grasped the reins looking about in panic for the Lord; she was relieved to see his horse nearby and him asleep as well slumped over the neck of the beast.  It was just past dawn and B'Elanna decided to find a place to hide and sleep for a few hours before they set out again.  The horses had simply been following the river, but the territory was now unfamiliar to B'Elanna so she cast about for some time before finding a thicket of bushes suitable for shelter.</p>
<p>She shook Harry awake and helped him down from his horse.  She led him to the thicket and covered him with one of the cloaks she had brought from the house.  When he was asleep again she saw to the horses, leading them to the river to drink and then hobbling them and allowing them to forage for food.  She dug a shallow depression in the ground a little way from their camp and put all of the money and weapons save one sword in the hole and covered it with branches and leaves so it was invisible to passers by.  Only then did she allow herself to fall asleep.</p>
<p>When she finally awakened hours later the sun was low in the west.  They had slept almost the entire day in their exhaustion.  She yawned and stretched as she got to her feet.  She looked at the young lord and seeing that he was still sound asleep decided to hunt for their breakfast, saving the smoked meat for an emergency.  She retrieved the crossbow from the depression in the ground and noting the position of the sun in the sky in relation to the horizon she headed out into the forest.  She cast back and forth for a half-hour before stumbling on a game trail leading away from the water.  She followed it for a distance, hoping to be able to catch an animal on its way down to the water to drink at dusk.  Finding a suitable spot to hide upwind of the trail she settled down, a bolt nocked into the crossbow, and waited.  Another half-hour had past and she was beginning to lose hope when she heard the sound of movement up the trail. She raised the crossbow, her eyes straining into the fading light.  Finally a medium sized boar made its appearance, trotting down the trail to the water.  She waited until it was close enough that the smell of the beast filled her nostrils before she fired.  The arrow buried itself deep into the side of the pig, but missed the heart and so the animal squealed loudly and ran off into the woods.  B'Elanna was in pursuit immediately; she ran until her lungs ached, always keeping the boar in sight.  Finally the animal attempted to circle past her on its way back to the trail.  She was on it in an instant, her dagger flashing once across the beast's throat.  She threw her hands in the air in a silent victory cry before she hoisted her prize up onto her shoulder's and picked her way back to the trail and then to the encampment.</p>
<p>Harry had awakened shortly after B'Elanna had gone hunting and he panicked upon finding himself alone in the woods.  He had found the horses hobbled nearby and realized that his friend had not abandoned him, but he was terrified at finding himself alone in the woods; he cowered in the thicket in fear, nothing in his life had prepared him for such a feeling.  Always his needs had been anticipated and met before he even knew he had them.  He never had to decide what to do, wear or eat, all of that was taken care of by servants.  Now he was tired, sore and cold and for the first time in his life he was hungry.  He heard noises in the bushes and was terrified that the mob had followed them.  His heart was about to beat out of his chest when he heard B'Elanna's familiar low whistle.  When they were children she would often come to his window and whistle to let him know that her chores were finished and she was available to play.  He had never in his life heard such a sweet sound.</p>
<p>"Hungry," she grinned at him when he met her at the entrance to the thicket.  His eyes were wide with wonder as he saw her dump the body of the boar onto the ground.  He nodded his answer to the question and hurried to help her gather wood to build a fire.  Fire was a calculated risk since they didn't know how far they were from Kim manor, but one worth taking, as they hadn't really eaten in over a day.</p>
<p>B'Elanna had been hunting with her father and the Lord many times, and she had often watched them butcher the game, but she had never tried her hand at it before.  Still she dug in gamely, skinning the animal, and gutting it, saving the internal organs and anything else that might be of use before beginning to roast the meat over the flames.  She took the animal's bladder and blew it up; tying off the end to allow it to dry into a bag that would be useful for carrying water.  She then scraped all of the meat from the inside of the skin and hung it over the fire to cure.  Harry watched in amazement as his friend went about changing their fortunes from dismal to merely bleak.</p>
<p>An hour later their faces were covered in the grease of the animal as they tore into the meat with their bare hands and teeth.  Harry's distaste for the barbarity of their meal was quickly overridden by his hunger.  He had never tasted food so good in his life.  When they were sated they sat back by the fire and rested while the sun set.</p>
<p>Harry had been mulling something over in his mind as they ate.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna perhaps we should ride to Lord Rhys' manor.  He was a friend to my father; perhaps he will take us in and give us aid. Or we could ride into town and look for help there."</p>
<p>B'Elanna smiled at Harry's na&iuml;ve need to see the best in everyone.  "Harry, Lord Rhys has three sons and no daughters to marry you to.  The person he will help in this situation will be himself.  With your father's lands he can set all of his sons up for life without having to divide up his own family holdings.  You are the only person who can stop him laying claim to that land with the King now; trust me Harry he won't be happy to see you show up looking for succor."</p>
<p>Harry knew that B'Elanna was right; England's lands were limited and every noble family who wished to increase their holdings had to apply to the King, but there was precious little land available now for even the most loyal men.  In all likelihood Lord Rhys would be successful in a petition to take over stewardship of Lord Kim's lands only if Harry didn't make an appearance.</p>
<p>"What about going into town and begging the sheriff for aid?"</p>
<p>"So that I can be hung for murder?  Don't forget I killed a man last night Harry.  Robert Johnson is married to the niece of the Sheriff; I won't stand a chance if we show our faces in town.  Not to mention that Lord Rhys is sure to be looking for you there as well.  The sheriff is loyal to Rhys; he grew up on his estate.  I wouldn't care for either of our chances in town would you?"</p>
<p>"So we run?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what else we can do.  I think we should run as fast as we can and hope that everyone chooses to let us go, and forget we ever existed."  B'Elanna paused for a moment, lost in thought.  "Come, it is getting dark.  Let us make preparations to be on our way."</p>
<p>They saddled their horses in the dark; B'Elanna patiently teaching Harry how to tighten the cinch and tie off the equipment before they once again set off into the night.</p>
<p>Wanting to put as much distance between themselves and anyone who knew them as possible they agreed to ride all night and most of the following day.  At that point they decided it would be safe to begin travelling during the day and on the open road.  They had no destination and no plan in mind other than to leave Kim manor as far behind as possible.</p>
<p>They rode nonstop for the entire time, eating the leftover meat as they traveled.  They were both saddlesore and exhausted by the end of the day and they were both anxious to find a place to spend the night.  They had remained close to the river, and when they decided to stop for the night they looked about for a suitable clearing, finding one quickly they gratefully dismounted and hobbled the horses after ensuring their mounts had sufficient water.</p>
<p>They gathered up wood and B'Elanna taught Harry how to start a fire.  She set the potatoes she had brought with her in the coals and allowed them to roast.  They ate them with the last of the boar's meat, washing down their feast with water from the river.</p>
<p>B'Elanna lay on her back by the fire gazing up at the sky, finally feeling a measure of safety now that considerable distance had been put between them and the mob.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna?"</p>
<p>"Hmm..."</p>
<p>"What are we going to do?" Harry paused before speaking again.</p>
<p>"I mean how will we live now?"</p>
<p>She rolled up on her side and looked at her young companion through the flickering flames of the fire.</p>
<p>"I don't know Harry. You have a little gold and some silver from your father's study, but it won't last long.  We'll need to find a way to earn more."</p>
<p>"I don't know how to do anything," the despair in his voice was evident.</p>
<p>"Well, you're of noble birth, you could compete in the tournaments.  A lot of men make their living that way these days.  The prizes at some of the competitions are quite rich, and you can win horses and equipment as well."</p>
<p>"I'm not a fighter B'Elanna, you're more of a knight than I'll ever be."</p>
<p>"I guess I am aren't I?" B'Elanna laughed softly as she remembered all of the times she had bested Harry in their practice swordplay.</p>
<p>An idea was growing in B'Elanna's mind and she sat up in her eagerness to share it with her friend.</p>
<p>"I am more of a knight than you are, but I was also a better fighter than most of your father's men wasn't I?"</p>
<p>Harry nodded his agreement, unsure of where this was going.</p>
<p>"What if I competed in the tournaments?  I could win us more than enough money to live on I'm sure of it."  She was getting more and more excited by the moment.  All of her life she had chafed at the restrictions society place on women and what they were and weren't allowed to do.  Her father had finally stopped trying to turn her into a lady and allowed her to train with the men and do what she pleased with her life, but he despaired of what would become of her when he was gone.  He had taken solace in her friendship with the young Lord, hoping that she would always have a place on the manor because of it.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna, you have to be a noble, not to mention a man to compete at tournament."</p>
<p>"We can find a way around that.  If I cut my hair short nobody will ever take me for a woman.  People see what they expect to see in this world.  You know as well as I do that when we went to town the shopkeepers would always assume I was a boy.  We can do this Harry I know we can."</p>
<p>"B'Elanna if they catch us the stocks will be the nicest thing we can hope for."</p>
<p>"What are our options.  You have no skills and the only thing I'm allowed to do is to become a prostitute.  This could work with a little luck."</p>
<p>"With a lot of luck you mean.  You've never really fought against a knight before.  Sparring with my father's men hardly counts."</p>
<p>"I can practice with you and start by entering some of the smaller tournaments in the outlying counties."</p>
<p>"You don't even have any armour.  What are you planning to do about that?"</p>
<p>"Well, we could use the money we have from your family to outfit me at first.  I can pay you back out of my winnings."  She was full of confidence as the idea began to take root in her mind.  "Come on what do we really have to lose at this point?"</p>
<p>"You mean besides our lives?" He asked sarcastically.</p>
<p>"And what are they worth now Lord Kim?  We have no family, no home, and no future except for the one we make for ourselves from this point on."</p>
<p>"Well, what are you going to do about those?" He asked pointing to her breasts, still visible despite the looseness of her clothing.</p>
<p>"We can bind them tightly to my chest with cloth. Once I'm dressed in armour nobody will ever notice."</p>
<p>"And what is it exactly that I'll be doing while your off winning riches and glory in the lists?"</p>
<p>"Um, you can be my manservant, or my herald," she teased.  "Seriously, I need you to teach me everything I need to know in order to pass for nobility."</p>
<p>"What about everything you need to know in order to pass as a man?"</p>
<p>She gave him a playful shove; "I'll need to find a more qualified teacher for that."</p>
<p>He shoved her back and for a moment they were young again, just two carefree people laughing and wrestling in the woods.  She pinned him to the ground easily.</p>
<p>"See, I can do this Harry.  We can do this together, I know it."</p>
<p>To be honest Harry was relieved that so little was expected of him.  He doubted that he and B'Elanna could pull off this deception but having her be in charge and make all of the decisions was such a relief that he capitulated and agreed to act as her valet and herald as she competed in the tournaments.</p>
