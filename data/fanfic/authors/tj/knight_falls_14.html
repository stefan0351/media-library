<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 14 -->

<p>There was rather an awkward moment when they got back to the tent that Harry and B'Elanna were sharing.  There were comfortable sleeping accommodations for two, or four if they shared the beds, but given the newness of their situation nobody was comfortable making a suggestion as to who should sleep where.  This was made the more excruciating as B'Elanna was now faced with the prospect of having to tell Kate and Tom the truth about her identity.  Finally after several moments of silence in which the newcomers pretended to be interested in looking around their new home B'Elanna cleared her throat.</p>
<p>"I, uh, I have something to tell you, and I'm not sure how you are going to feel about it.  I would only hope that you remember that whatever else may be, I am and will always be the same person you've known for some time now, and I hope that you will be able to judge me based on that alone."</p>
<p>Harry stepped forward and attempted to help B'Elanna out, "What Beyla is trying to say?."</p>
<p>"No Harry, this is something I need to do on my own?. What I'm trying to say is that?well let's start with the easy stuff first shall we?  To begin with I am not of noble birth, that is to say that I am neither Lord Beyla, nor am I a knight."</p>
<p>There was a stunned silence at this admission.  Everyone knew that to impersonate nobility was punishable by death, but to have done it in such a bold and public manner was incredible.  If this was 'the easy stuff' neither Kate nor Tom could conceive of what the 'difficult stuff' could possibly be.</p>
<p>After another moment of awkward silence B'Elanna continued.</p>
<p>"My name is B'Elanna Torrance and I am a woman."</p>
<p>Nobody in the tent moved?in fact it seemed as though not even the people who already knew the truth could bring themselves to breathe.  After another dazed silence it was finally Tom who found his voice.</p>
<p>"Did you know this Lady Annika?"  He couldn't believe that this delicate and proper Lady would involve herself in such a situation.</p>
<p>"Not at first, no.  But I have known for some time now and although I did not know Beyla's true name or situation until this very moment I nonetheless love him?her, and nothing will change that fact."</p>
<p>"Well, I suppose I have no choice but to accept it," said Kate with a look of disbelief on her face.  "I cannot believe that I am indentured to a commoner like myself."</p>
<p>"Indentured?what? No, Kate you misunderstand.  I didn't buy your indenture from Lord Hansart; I bought your freedom.  You may stay or go as you please I have no desire to 'own' anyone," B'Elanna explained.</p>
<p>"Free," Kate's eyes were wide with wonder. "You mean if I choose to leave this moment you won't stop me; I can do as I please?"</p>
<p>"Yes, absolutely!  Please know that you will always have a home and employment here with Annika if you chose it, but if you cannot accept me for who and what I am then you are of course free to go.  I would only ask that you keep my secret for if you are indiscrete it will surely cost me my life, and perhaps Annika's as well."</p>
<p>Kate did not have words to express her feelings at finally receiving her freedom, so she merely nodded, her eyes filled with unshed tears.</p>
<p>"I don't understand this at all," Tom finally spoke up.  "How is it possible that you are a woman and yet a tournament champion?you fight like a knight."</p>
<p>At this point Harry intervened and began to explain the story from its beginnings the night that he heard of his father's death at the Battle of Agincourt.  This story was new to Annika as well and so the group all found places to sit while Harry told the entire story of B'Elanna saving him from the mob and her eventual decision to become a knight in order to support both of them.  Nobody could believe what they were hearing, but the story was so engaging that not a word was spoken until Harry finished the tale at the point where he and B'Elanna had finally met the Hansart family.</p>
<p>"Well, you know the rest," he finished.</p>
<p>"So, let me get this straight?<b>you</b> are the Lord, but you are acting as squire for a woman who is pretending to be a Lord?" Tom managed.</p>
<p>"Well, yes actually," Harry answered with a boyish grin.  "And I wouldn't trade places with any Lord in Christendom.  This is the life I have chosen and I have never been happier."</p>
<p>They all talked for a while longer and Harry and B'Elanna answered the numerous questions the others had for them.  Annika had remained silent all the while the rest of them spoke.  This was the first time that she had heard the entire story of B'Elanna's life.  She couldn't conceive of the courage and strength it had taken B'Elanna to live as she had.  Although she could never have imagined such a thing she found that she was completely in love with the enigmatic woman who had the nerve and the daring to flaunt all convention and live her life on her own terms.  Annika knew that she wanted to be with B'Elanna no matter what it required her to sacrifice.  Hearing the story of B'Elanna's life made her love her more.  She was frightened about what the future might hold, and terrified of what would happen to them if their secret was ever revealed, but that was a small consideration when viewed beside the love she felt for her Knight?for indeed that was how she would always think of B'Elanna.</p>
<p>In the end it was B'Elanna who brought an end to the discussion.  It was obvious that Kate and Tom had reservations about the whole situation, but also that they were not ready to abandon their new friends just yet.  B'Elanna decided that Kate and Annika should share the bed in her half of the tent and that she, Tom, and Harry would share the other side.  They all bustled about finding suitable nightclothes for the newcomers and soon all save Harry and B'Elanna were settled in bed.  B'Elanna went outside to sit by the remains of the fire that was burning in the common area between the tents.  Harry waited a moment and then followed her out, taking a seat beside her he waited for her to speak.</p>
<p>"I killed a man today," she finally said.</p>
<p>Harry just waited, knowing that B'Elanna needed time to work all of this out before she could talk about it.</p>
<p>"I know I have taken lives before, but that was different somehow.  I killed Robert Johnson to save our lives and when I took the life of the highwayman it was in the heat of battle, but today was different.  It was personal?the look in his eyes when he died Harry?I don't know if I'll ever be able to forget that look."</p>
<p>Harry put his arm around the shoulders of his friend.  "I'd be more worried about you if you could forget that look.  I know we make our living with violence in a manner of speaking, but underneath it all you are still a caring human being?of course you are affected by the taking of life."</p>
<p>B'Elanna nodded mutely as she stared into the flames.</p>
<p>"How am I ever going to look after all of these people?" </p>
<p>"We'll figure something out.  We have more than enough money and there are only a few more tournaments left before we go to London for the final tournament of the season.  After that we can worry about what to do," Harry reassured her.</p>
<p>"I can't ask Annika to live in the woods for the winter?she's a Lady, she deserves better!"</p>
<p>"B'Elanna she would be content to live anywhere as long as you are together, I've seen the way she looks at you, she knew she deserved better and that is why she came here to be with you?this IS better for her."</p>
<p>They sat in silence for a while longer before Harry stood up and offered his hand to B'Elanna.  </p>
<p>"Come on ?we aren't going to solve this tonight and you need your sleep for the competitions tomorrow?now that you have a family to support," he grinned.</p>
<p>B'Elanna hesitated for a moment before taking his hand and standing up.  They went into the tent and curled up on the floor in the old sleeping furs they used when they were camping.  Despite the worry and the events of the day they fell asleep quickly.</p>
<p>Early the next morning B'Elanna got up to begin her preparations for the day's tournament events.  Despite Harry's assurance that they would be all right she felt a real pressure to win that had never been present before.  Every win would now mean the difference between supporting and failing to support her chosen family.  It was no longer a fun game to become tournament champion but a serious business of earning money.  </p>
<p>Harry rigged up a sheet in the corner of the tent behind which he could bind B'Elanna's chest out of sight of the others, and once they were finished B'Elanna went quietly into the other half of the tent to retrieve her clothing for the day.  Annika and Kate were just beginning to wake up so she whispered a good morning to them before leaving to dress behind the curtain on the other side.  Once finished she stepped outside where Harry was preparing the morning meal.  She began to stretch to warm up her muscles and as she was doing so Tom stepped outside to greet the morning.  He watched B'Elanna as she limbered up and was again incredulous of the fact that she was a woman.  Her body was lean and strong and her muscles rippled as she moved, he felt a stirring of arousal as he watched her which he firmly extinguished with the thought of what she was capable of doing to him if she ever found out.  </p>
<p>He moved to help Harry with the meal preparations, all the time keeping an eye on B'Elanna.  He saw the look that completely transformed her face when Annika stepped outside of the tent.  It was like watching the sunrise?seeing the beautiful light that spread over her features with her lovestruck smile.  When he saw an answering smile on Annika's face any doubts he harboured about whether or not he would accept this situation and stay with B'Elanna and the Lady Annika they were dispelled at the sight of such obvious love.  You just couldn't argue with a look like that.  </p>
<p>Kate offered to clean up after the meal while Harry and Tom went to the stables to prepare Goliath for the day.  B'Elanna was cleaning and inspecting her armour while Annika, feeling a little useless, sat and watched.  Annika looked up at hearing footsteps and was surprised to see her mother approaching.  She was alone which was entirely unusual and she had her hands full with several packages.  Upon hearing Annika's intake of breath B'Elanna looked up and saw the elder Lady Hansart as well.  She leapt to her feet to take the parcels from the Lady's arms and bid her welcome to their camp.</p>
<p>"Your father and I are leaving for France today Annika.  He doesn't know that I am here?he would be angry if he knew I'm sure.  I just wanted to see you again and to make sure that you are happy my daughter.  I want you to know that if you change your mind you are welcome to return home with us."</p>
<p>B'Elanna held her breath while she waited for Annika's reply.</p>
<p>"No mother?I am exactly where I am meant to be."</p>
<p>"Well, I thought as much, but I had to be certain.  I know your father said some cruel things to you yesterday, but please don't judge him too harshly.  He only wants what he feels is best for you."  She held up her hand to forestall Annika's protest.  "I know that you are happy Annika, but your father cannot conceive of happiness without money and power?it is all he understands and he believes you will suffer because of the choices you have made."</p>
<p>Lady Hansart paused for a moment while she struggled to control her emotions.</p>
<p>"I just wanted to see you again, and to tell you that I love you, that I will always love you.  I hope that you both will be very happy together."</p>
<p>She paused once more to wipe the tears from her eyes.</p>
<p>"I also wanted to give you this," she said as she took the largest of the packages from B'Elanna's hands and gave it to Annika.  "Go ahead and open it."</p>
<p>Annika removed the wrapping from the parcel and gasped as she saw the heavy cream coloured linen dress inside the package.</p>
<p>"It is the wedding dress I commissioned when your father struck his bargain with Lord Kotay.  It was delivered yesterday and I was going to surprise you with it when you returned from the tournament.  I wanted you to have it to wear when you and Lord Beyla are wed.  I wish I could be there to see it but your father insists that we leave right away," she sobbed.</p>
<p>Annika held her mother closely and murmured words of love and forgiveness to this woman who had dared more in defying her husband and coming to see her than she ever had before.  When Lady Hansart finally had herself under control she took the last two packages and handed them to Annika to open.  The first one contained a necklace that had been handed down to the Hansart women through the years and the second, much heavier one, contained a number of gold and silver pieces.</p>
<p>"It is all the money that I have independently of your father.  I wanted you to have it as part of your dowry.  I know that Lord Beyla can look after you but it never hurts a newly married couple to have a little extra just in case."</p>
<p>She had scrimped over the years to save this money; it was saved from household expenses and set aside a little at a time until she had built up quite a nest egg so she would always feel secure should anything happen to her husband.  She gladly parted with it now.</p>
<p>Mother and daughter embraced again and then Lady Hansart turned to B'Elanna.</p>
<p>"Please take care of my daughter Lord Beyla.  Be happy together," she said as she hugged the young Lord.</p>
<p>"I swear on my life Lady Hansart I will do everything in power to see that she is always safe and happy."</p>
<p>"I know you will my Lord," said the older woman and then she kissed B'Elanna on each cheek, hugged her daughter fiercely once more and then she departed swiftly through the growing crowds, hoping to return to the inn before her husband noticed she was gone.</p>
<p>Tears were streaming down Annika's face as she watched her mother's departing figure.  B'Elanna took her in her arms and held her close, stroking her hair and murmuring assurances that everything was going to be all right.  Finally Annika cried herself out and gave herself over to being held in the arms of the woman she loved?the woman she had given up her entire way of life to be with.  Even though she was saddened at the loss of her parents she was happy to be with B'Elanna and certain that she had made the right choice.  She straightened up finally and gazed deeply into the eyes of her love before kissing her softly.</p>
<p>"You are my entire life B'Elanna," she said using her love's proper name for the first time.  "I love you."</p>
<p>They were simple words, but they were all that needed to be spoken.</p>
<p>"Now, you need to get ready for the day.  Tell me how I can help."</p>
<p>"I love you Lady Hansart," B'Elanna said at her love's obvious attempt to be brave.  She held her close for a moment longer and then began to show her the intricacies of putting on a suit of armour.</p>
