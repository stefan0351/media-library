<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 11 -->

<p>The next few tournaments passed by in a blur of faces, matches and pain.  B'Elanna saw Annika everywhere she looked and even danced with her on occasion despite her efforts to line up for the dance so that they would not intersect one another.  She never again attempted to speak to the Lady, however, she did notice that whenever she looked over at her Annika always seemed to be starring back, although she never attempted to make further contact.  B'Elanna noticed that Annika was almost constantly in the company of Charles Kotay and the rumour mill had it that the talks of marriage were almost concluded between Kotay and Lord Hansart.  Kotay had ceased competing in the joust since the talks had begun and B'Elanna was disappointed that she did not have the opportunity to take his measure in the arena.  She would dearly have loved to unhorse him in front of Lord and Lady Hansart, not to mention Annika.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was in the sword ring facing an opponent that she had met several times before.  She was having no difficulty in scoring her points, and since her fury had faded somewhat over the course of the last few tournaments she was allowing the match to go longer than the few minutes it would really take her to defeat the fellow.  The crowd appreciated her showmanship and so she allowed her competition time to make a show of it.  She was distracted suddenly at the sight of a flash of white blonde hair near the side of the ring.  Upon further inspection she saw that it was indeed Annika, alone and standing cheek by jowl with the crowd who came to watch the sword on foot contests.  Losing her concentration she did not see the thrust coming until it was almost too late, she managed to get her sword up in time to deflect it somewhat, but unfortunately the blade slid along her armour and managed to pierce the leather articulation at her shoulder and the tip of the blade sunk into her skin. Twisting aside in pain the blade was pulled out, the tip of it covered in blood.  B'Elanna felt the pain in her shoulder begin to pulse, but she managed to finish the fight despite it.</p>
<p>As she left the ring she saw Annika keeping pace with her and Harry, remaining slightly off to one side in an effort not be seen.  She attempted to make her way over to her, but upon seeing her approach Annika veered off and disappeared into the crowd.  When they got back to the tent Harry helped B'Elanna remove her armour and he inspected the wound.  It did not appear to be all that deep, but it seemed like it might require the attention of the surgeon.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna you need to have the surgeon look at this and sew it back up."</p>
<p>"I can't Harry, you're going to have to look after it yourself."</p>
<p>"But why, you've had the surgeon before, why not now."</p>
<p>"Look where the wound is Harry, I'd have to remove my tunic and shirt for him and that would be the end of me.  Just wash it out and bind it up as best you can.  I'll be fine."</p>
<p>"Perhaps if we went to another town you could see the surgeon as a woman...."</p>
<p>"And explain how a woman came to have a sword wound in her shoulder.... I think not Harry.  Just do the best you can."</p>
<p>Harry washed the wound as best he could and bound it tightly.  They were short on time before the joust and so B'Elanna quickly dressed and hurried to the arena.  She mounted up and grasped her lance and charged as always...when her opponent made contact with her shoulder she almost cried out in agony.  She made it through to the end of the match, but when they removed her armour the blood was already soaking through her shirt, and so she had Harry go and inform the officials that she was withdrawing from the tournament.  She returned to her tent and attempted to wash and bind the wound again before she lay down to sleep.</p>
<p>The next day her shoulder was worse...the throbbing was almost continuous and the wound felt hot to the touch.  It was obvious that despite their efforts to keep the wound clean it had become infected.  B'Elanna was frantic as she knew she needed to see a doctor but at the same time knew her life could be in greater danger if she did.  The only bright spot to the day was Harry's information that Annika had sent Tom around to inquire if Beyla was all right as she was terribly worried about him since she had heard he had withdrawn from the tournament.  It was cold comfort however as B'Elanna was at a loss as to what to do about her injury.</p>
<p>Harry left her while she was sleeping and made his way through the tournament grounds...talking to various people he had met over the course of the tournaments.  Finally his inquires were rewarded and he was sent to speak to an older local man who may know of a solution to his problem.  The man gave Harry directions to an encampment outside of town where there may be someone who could help them without questions and Harry returned to the tent to rouse B'Elanna and pack up their belongings.  B'Elanna was skeptical of his plan but having no other options agreed to go along with it for now.  It was not long before they were packed up and on their way out of town, as they passed through arches leading away from the tournament grounds B'Elanna saw Annika standing by the side of the road.  She raised a hand in greeting and received a quick nod in reply before Annika hurried away, back toward the arena.  Well at least that was something, it appeared that Annika did in fact care whether she lived or died.  That thought cheered B'Elanna somewhat as they wound their way out of town and toward the King's forest.</p>
<p>They had to cast back and forth several times on the road before they found the faint track that led back into the forest.  The going was rough and several times they were afraid they might have to abandon their wagon when the path disappeared into the thick underbrush.  By dint of much effort they finally managed to win their way through and eventually they came to the encampment the local man had described.  There were several hovels built from mud and sticks and a central area with a large fire pit that appeared to be a communal cooking and meeting area.  Chickens, pigs and goats wandered freely around the small enclave and there were several healthy looking children laughing and playing in the clearing.  They stopped just outside of the camp and tied up their animals, proceeding on foot toward the nearest hut.  They were greeted by a huge bear of a man, who demanded to know who they were and what business they had here.  Harry gave the name of the man who had sent them and made his humble request to meet with Mary, the woman who was recommended to him as a healer of some renown.</p>
<p>The man was clearly unhappy about having a nobleman in his encampment but Harry's earnest entreaties eventually won him over and they were taken to meet the healer. Given the stories that B'Elanna and Harry had been told as a child about the pagan witches who lived in the forests they were expecting a wizened old crone with a humped back and warts on her nose. So it was that they were shocked to meet a beautiful woman only a few years older than themselves.  She was soft-spoken and they immediately felt at ease with her.  B'Elanna explained her injury to the woman who simply asked that she remove her tunic and shirt and sit in a chair by the fire.  When B'Elanna was finished removing her clothes the woman raised an eyebrow at the sight of the bindings around B'Elanna's chest but said nothing.  She merely made and examination of the wound and then began to prepare her medications.</p>
<p>She first had B'Elanna drink a tea that had her feeling sleepy and relaxed.  It dulled the sensation somewhat as the woman probed into the wound.  B'Elanna gritted her teeth and bore the pain as the woman spread the edges of the wound wide and used a fine knife she had heated in the fire first to dig out a tiny splinter of metal that had been left in the wound.  It must have shattered off the end of her opponent's sword when she twisted away from the blow.  Once the splinter was removed the woman bathed the wound in a foul smelling potion and then proceeded to sew it up with as much skill as any surgeon.  She applied a healing poultice to B'Elanna's shoulder and bandaged it loosely before immobilizing B'Elanna's arm for the time being.  In all of the time she was working she never spoke a word, and neither did B'Elanna.</p>
<p>When she was finished her work she helped B'Elanna to redress and took her arm, leading her outside into the clearing.</p>
<p>"Why do choose to live out here so far from everything," B'Elanna inquired.  "With your skills you could be a surgeon in any town."</p>
<p>"We used to live in the city in harmony with the rest of the world.  My mother was a village healer for years and her mother before her, but now as the hold of the church goes stronger we are driven into the woods, and are no longer welcome in the cities.  The priests preach against us from their pulpits and condemn us as devil worshippers.  It is no longer safe for us to practice openly, and so we hide here in the forest."</p>
<p>"I hide as well, but in plain sight," B'Elanna replied.</p>
<p>The young healer gave her a smile at that.</p>
<p>"It would seem we have much in common then."</p>
<p>"I suppose so...neither of us would fare very well if our secrets were revealed to the wrong people."</p>
<p>"Your secret is safe with me B'Elanna," the healer replied.</p>
<p>The two of them continued walking and talking through the woods.  Mary described their life and their beliefs and told her how the villagers still snuck into the woods to dance around the Beltanne fires and celebrate the solstice in the old way, but then returned to church to pray for their mortal souls on Sunday.  B'Elanna was surprised to hear of such things, as she had never worshipped in a Cathedral.  She was however intrigued by Mary's description of her beliefs and they spent several hours discussing such issues until the sun was sinking in the west.  Mary invited Harry and B'Elanna to spend the night with them and they happily agreed.</p>
<p>They slept under the stars near the village fire after sharing the evening meal with the inhabitants of the camp.  After dinner they enjoyed the singing of several of the young men of the village before they retired for the night.</p>
<p>The next day Mary gave B'Elanna several vials of healing potions and instructed Harry on how to care for the wound.  She also gave B'Elanna some herbs to brew in a tea and suggested she drink it once a day for at least a week.  The last thing she did was to show Harry how to remove the stitches from B'Elanna's shoulder after the proper time had passed.  She gave them the names and locations of several other pagan enclaves in the areas they would be visiting in the future and assured them that if they needed help with anything they had only to ask.  B'Elanna had enjoyed her time in the village and she found that she was saddened to depart the company of such compassionate and honest people.  Still, she knew that they needed to keep moving in order to keep up with the tournament circuit, and she was anxious to see Annika again, if only from a distance.</p>
