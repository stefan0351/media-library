<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 5 -->

<p>Nothing in B'Elanna's life could have possibly prepared her for this.  She was in full armour, minus her helmet, astride her horse riding into the tournament grounds of Rouen amidst hundreds of knights and their retinues.  Harry was beside and slightly behind her and her carried her standard high over their heads.  What seemed like thousands of people lined the parade route cheering and chanting as the knights paraded through the city on their way to the arena.  Children ran beside the horses, the boldest of them daring to reach out for a brief touch of one of their heroes.  It was absolute pandemonium and as her horse danced and shied it was only her skills as a horseman that kept her from being thrown.  It made for quite a show however and the crowd cheered harder as she brought her mount under control.</p>
<p>When they passed under the arches and into the tournament grounds both B'Elanna and her mount were calmer, and she finally allowed herself to take a good look around.  She saw knights of all descriptions, young and old, battle scarred and unblemished like herself.  She felt a flutter of nervousness in her stomach at the sight of some of the fierce visages that surrounded her.  As they formed lines to face the viewing stands where the nobility gathered to watch the games she scrutinized the faces in the boxes at the centre of the stands. There were all manner of people there, their dress was richer than she had imagined, and the display of jewels and gold took her breath away.  Her eye fell on a young woman sitting on the right side of centre boxes.  Her hair was a pale gold and her skin a flawless white.  B'Elanna had never seen such beauty before in her life. She could only stare at the vision in front of her.  She was too far away to see much else of the young woman and as the Crown Prince began his speech, in both English and French, she listened intently to his words and forgot about the beautiful young woman.</p>
<p>The wind that was blowing through the grounds caused the pennants at the peaks of the viewing stands to snap vigorously in the wind.  It was an unbelievable spectacle of colour and sounds and B'Elanna had trouble imagining that she was a part of it.  These people had come here to see her do battle, and she was determined not to disappoint them.</p>
<p>The first day of the tournament was mostly dedicated to organization.  Harry went to the official's tent and struck the shields depicting the events in which Beyla would participate, he then arranged for their sleeping quarters in an assigned tent and made plans to have the horses stabled for the duration of the multi-day tournament.  He unloaded all of their equipment into their tent and arranged the sleeping gear on the mats on the floor.  After all of their weeks of sleeping in the forest this simple tent seemed like the lap of luxury.  When their gear was stowed Harry and B'Elanna strolled through the tent city that had sprung up around the tournament grounds.  There were jugglers, fire-eaters and tumblers to watch and any number of trinkets to buy at the market place.  Several armourers had set up their forges within the confines of the tournament grounds and B'Elanna spent several hours admiring their wares and discussing the attributes of various weapons.</p>
<p>This was the first tournament B'Elanna had attended that was large enough to have jousting as an event and she and Harry watched, fascinated, as some of the knight's practiced their skills in an open area just outside of the main tent village.  Harry's father had not jousted and so B'Elanna had never had occasion to see such a sight before and she found it thrilling.  The combination of strength, skill and horsemanship, not to mention the courage that these knights exhibited caught her imagination and she began to wonder if this was not something that she might like to learn for future tournaments.</p>
<p>The next day as she approached the area that hosted the general melee rounds she was disappointed to see that very few people bothered to attend this event.  The opening rounds of the jousting were being held inside the main arena and she could hear the roar of the crowd from here.  Nevertheless she marshaled her thoughts and joined the line of men waiting to be chosen for sides.  She felt as if she had been transported back in time to her first tournament.  Despite her successes in England nobody here had ever heard of Lord Beyla and she was once again judged for her small stature and was chosen last for a team.  She squared off with her teammates and waited for the signal to begin.  As the fray began she realized that this competition did not draw the young powerful knights that she had seen during the opening parade.  These were the young and untried nobles, or the older men whose best years had passed them by.  She had no trouble at all defending herself against her opponents, and to her surprise she handily won the round.</p>
<p>The crowd that had gathered cheered her as she remained the last man standing, and she was gratified for their support.  As she walked out of the lists several small boys with wooden swords swooped and yelled around her and she happily engaged them in mock battle for several minutes before finding a spot in the shade to rest until her next round began.  Harry could sense her disappointment with the level of competition as he joined her under the awning next to the field.  He compensated by bragging wildly about her victory and showing her the large pile of coins they had won.  This cheered B'Elanna up somewhat and she found herself looking forward to the next round.</p>
<p>She fought three more rounds that day, winning them all.  The final was to be held on the following day and so she and Harry retired to their tent to change and clean up before climbing into the stands to watch the last of the jousting matches for the day.  Harry had found out that the tournament champion was the knight who won the joust and both he and B'Elanna realized that she was going to have to learn to tilt if they were ever to earn a substantial amount of money at the tournaments.  They decided to forgo the tournament at Amiens in favour of returning to England and beginning her training for the joust.  Judging by the amount of money they had won so far in just the general melee rounds they would have sufficient money for the undertaking by the time this tournament was over.</p>
<p>The five days of the tournament went by in a blur of sights, smells, and experiences that forever changed B'Elanna's perception of the world.  She found herself the overall champion of the general melee rounds as well as winner of the individual sword on foot competition.  The final of the sword fight on horseback was to be held in the main arena on this last day of competition.  She had not yet entered the main lists as a competitor and she was a little nervous to do so now.  Harry stayed close to her, talking calmly and offering her advice based on his observance of her competitor in his other rounds.  He was certain she could win if she remained calm and focused on the fight and not the crowd.</p>
<p>The finals of the joust were to be held directly after the mounted sword fights and so the stands were filled to capacity with nobles and previously eliminated knights.  On the other side of the arena the peasants were standing in crushing numbers straining for a good view of the competition.  The noise was deafening, and once again B'Elanna had to soothe her mount's nerves, gently stoking him and whispering into his ear as she stood waiting for the start of the fight.</p>
<p>At the other end of the arena she saw her competition enter the lists.  Several men at arms as well as his herald and his squire surrounded him.  They tightened his armour and brought around a step for him to stand on as he heaved himself into the saddle.  B'Elanna grinned at Harry as he adjusted her armour.</p>
<p>"Let's give 'em a show they'll remember shall we?"  She said as her head disappeared under her helmet.</p>
<p>She turned to face the crowd and bowed in both directions before placing one hand on the pommel of the saddle and vaulting to her seat in one smooth movement.  The crowd cheered wildly at her display of strength and agility, and already she heard a faint chanting of her name.  She touched her heels lightly to the flanks of her mount and the horse danced sideways into the centre of the ring.  The noise of the crowd rose as her horse reared up, front legs pawing the air as if he too were anxious for the fight to begin.</p>
<p>The tournament herald introduced the two combatants and as they waited B'Elanna scanned the crowd, once again noticing the beautiful blonde woman sitting near the central boxes.  She was so entranced at the sight of the woman that she missed the signal for the start of the battle and nearly lost her head at her opponent's first blow before her mind snapped back to its task.</p>
<p>This was the fiercest battle in which she had ever been engaged.  Her opponent was strong and cunning and it took all of her skills to duck and parry his blows.  They charged from opposite sides of the arena, swinging wildly before closing together, horses jostling and pushing for advantage.  B'Elanna felt her leg being crushed between the animals despite the chausses she wore to protect herself.  She could smell the sweat of her opponent and the earthy scent of the animals filled her nose.  She gave slightly, throwing her opponent off balance and managed to land a glancing blow on his shoulder, but it was enough. She had scored the first point.  They broke apart again, each circling looking for advantage.  He urged his mount in closer and thrust his sword savagely toward her, she parried his blow, but he managed to regain his momentum quickly and he scored a strike before she was ready to defend herself again.  Once again they surged together, each looking for an opening.  They traded a fierce volley of blows; neither managing to land a scoring hit.  B'Elanna urged her horse away, galloping in a circle of the stadium as her opponent did the same, they charged down the middle of the ring toward one another and B'Elanna steeled herself, she leaned toward him slightly and swung her sword in a great whistling arc through the air.  She left herself completely vulnerable but it was no matter, her massive swing caught her opponent full in the chest, dragging him bodily off the back of his horse.  There was a great cry from the crowd.  She had unhorsed her first opponent, not only did she win the battle but she won his horse and its armour into the bargain.</p>
<p>She snapped the visor of her helmet up and urged her horse into a gallop around the ring. Several of the young ladies had thrown scarves into the arena upon her victory and as she went she used the tip of her sword to scoop one of them up from the ground, holding it aloft like a banner as she finished her victory lap.  She saluted her opponent, as Harry gathered up the reins to her new horse, and then she bowed to the royals in the box before leaving the lists, the cheers of the crowd still echoing in her brain.</p>
<p>Neither she nor Harry could contain themselves, and they hugged one another fiercely after they were out of the stadium.  Harry helped her out of her helmet and doused her head with water as they talked excitedly about her victory.  They took the horses to the stables and made arrangements for their care before returning to watch the joust finals.  It was thrilling to watch and B'Elanna couldn't wait to begin her training.  She was certain she was going to love tilting, and now she had won a sufficient amount of gold to outfit herself for competition.  She took it as a sign that they were doing the right thing.</p>
<p>She stood in the line of knights to receive her rewards and they were greater than all of her other winnings combined, but they still paled in comparison to the award that went to the tournament champion.  B'Elanna smiled at the thought of everything she and Harry would be able to do with such wealth once they returned to England.  Life was looking good for them both.  She had the required papers now and soon she would be training for the moment when she would be tournament champion.  She barely heard the speeches of the nobility as she daydreamed about their future.</p>
<p>She and Harry were in their tent washing up after the day's efforts.  Harry was insisting that B'Elanna allow him to trim her hair and she was chafing under his fussing.</p>
<p>"It looks fine Harry, just leave it be."</p>
<p>"It doesn't look fine, it looks scruffy and you need to be presentable tonight."</p>
<p>"I still don't see why it matters, we don't know anyone here.  I say we skip the banquet and get ready to ride back to Calais."</p>
<p>"You never know when friendships with powerful people will come in handy.  Politics is a game you're going to have to learn to play.  There is enough English nobility here to start a new country, so we're going to the banquet and you are going to smile and dance and make polite conversation with the Lords and Ladies."</p>
<p>"Fine, fine?let's just get it over with shall we?"</p>
<p>"Temper temper my Lord," Harry teased as he finished trimming B'Elanna's hair and gave her a playful shove toward the door.</p>
<p>The banquet hall was massive and was already filled with a crowd of people talking and laughing as they circulated around the huge stone room.  There were several tables groaning under their load of food?delicacies the like of which B'Elanna had never seen before.  She tried several unfamiliar foods almost moaning her pleasure at the exquisite tastes.  She was stopped in her perambulations by several knights to discuss her success at the tournament and was gratified to note that none of them seemed to find anything out of the ordinary about her.  She stood amongst a large group of men and traded mock insults to manhood and battle prowess for several minutes before she moved on to sample some more of the food.</p>
<p>Things seemed to be going very well when to her dismay she heard the sound of the orchestra tuning up their instruments.  The master of the dance took to the floor and announced that the first dance was to be a Galliard and he exhorted those present to line up in preparation for the dance.  B'Elanna felt a hand on her sleeve and turned to face a pretty young woman who urged Lord Beyla out onto the dance floor.  B'Elanna smiled her acceptance and took the hand of the young woman.  They formed lines on the floor and B'Elanna bowed deeply to her partner as they joined hands and began the intricate dance.  She felt she was doing quite well and as the music played she was almost enjoying herself.  The two lines began to intertwine as partners changed and B'Elanna held her hand out for the next woman to take and stumbled over her own feet as she looked into the cerulean blue eyes of the blond woman from the viewing stands.</p>
<p>She recovered quickly and forced herself to look up again at the young lady with whom she was dancing.  There was an amused smile on her beautiful face, which only caused B'Elanna to blush more furiously. She stumbled yet once more and recovered again, only managing to get her feet under control moments before she was forced to change partners yet once more.</p>
<p>She cursed herself soundly for her awkwardness as the dancing continued.  She partnered the young women several more times before the orchestra stopped playing and was gratified that she was able to look the blonde beauty in the eyes the next time without blushing.  She found herself strangely saddened that the dancing was over as she had hoped to hold the young woman's delicate hand in her own once more.  As the crowd made preparations to depart she forced herself to seek out the young woman, and, bowing deeply, kissed her hand and thanked her for the honour of the dance before accepting her cloak from Harry and leaving the banquet hall.</p>
<p>Sleep was a stranger that night; the image of the beautiful woman allowed for no rest.  B'Elanna could still feel the cool silk of that delicate hand resting in her palm as they danced.  She stared at the roof of the tent listening to the soft familiar sounds of the night around her and tried to understand why she was feeling this way about a strange woman.  As Lord Beyla she had flirted with many of the young Ladies who flocked to the tournaments, and she had to admit to herself that she had come to enjoy those flirtations, but this was something more.  Never had she felt her heart clench and her stomach drop just at the sight of another woman.  She had assumed that when she became Lord Beyla she was forgoing the possibility of love, and yet now she began to question that assumption.  Was it possible that she might find love in the arms of another woman.  She groaned in frustration as her mind refused to let go of the image of ethereal beauty, rolling over she pulled her cloak over her head and tried again to grasp sleep's elusive spirit.</p>
<p>As they rode toward Calais the next day they laid their plans for the coming weeks.  They talked at length about the training and equipment they would require, and where they might stay to undertake this training.  Although their minds were busy with the future, whenever they fell silent B'Elanna's mind would wander back to Rouen and the beautiful woman she was leaving behind there.  She shook her head to clear it of the image of the stranger and forced her mind to concentrate on the future and leave the past behind.</p>
<p>B'Elanna oversaw the loading of their horses and gear onto the ship bound for England while Harry spent every possible moment he could on dry land, only coming aboard as the ship weighed anchor and slipped out to sea.  It was a much calmer day than their last trip, but even so the rolling of the waves caused the young man to immediately feel ill, and he hastened below decks to try to sleep away the journey.  Once again B'Elanna enjoyed the freedom and the salt air of the ship's deck and she wandered aimlessly around the ship, her cloak drawn tightly around her shoulder to ward off the salty spray.  She rounded the corner near the fo'castle and saw a figure sitting hunched over on a bench against the ship's wheelhouse.  Her eye caught the flash of white blond hair and it was a moment before she dared approach.</p>
<p>As she drew closer she couldn't believe her eyes for it was indeed the beautiful young woman from Rouen.  The woman was leaning over and looked decidedly ill at ease, her face even paler than it had been, with only the slightest greenish cast.  Even so she was beauty personified.  B'Elanna approached and knelt before her.</p>
<p>"Milady are you ill?"  She inquired gently.</p>
<p>"I am?unwell.  I have never been aboard a ship before.  I fear it does not agree with me."  Her voice was soft and slightly accented with the lilting overtones of the French.</p>
<p>"The worst of the motion is here amidships, perhaps if you came with me to the bow you would feel better," B'Elanna said offering the woman her arm.</p>
<p>The young lady hesitated only a moment before accepting Lord Beyla's offer, and B'Elanna was gratified to feel the young woman lean heavily on her arm as she led her to the front of the ship.</p>
<p>"It helps if you keep your eyes on the horizon, or so I'm told," B'Elanna offered as they reached the bow.  The young woman followed her advice, placing one hand on the ship's rail and keeping her other tucked in B'Elanna's arm.  B'Elanna felt her heart hammering as they stood in silence both intently watching the horizon.</p>
<p>"I believe you are correct.  I am feeling somewhat better.  I thank you my Lord," the young woman spoke quietly.</p>
<p>B'Elanna noticed the young woman was shivering in the cold and quickly removed her cloak, wrapping it around the woman's slight shoulders.</p>
<p>"Thank you Lord Beyla, you are most kind."</p>
<p>"I am afraid you have the advantage over me.  I do not know your name."</p>
<p>"I am called Annika Hansart My Lord."</p>
<p>"An English name."</p>
<p>"Yes, we are, we were English, and we will be again as soon as my father makes arrangements for my marriage."</p>
<p>"You are to be married?" B'Elanna's heart stopped beating in her chest.</p>
<p>"As soon as my father finds a suitable husband for me.  I'm afraid we blow with the wind and now the wind is blowing from London, so an English Lord it will be for me," Lady Hansart sighed.</p>
<p>"But what do you want?"</p>
<p>"It matters not what I want, my father will do what is best for our family and I will follow his wishes.  It doesn't do for a Lady to want for anything much in this world."</p>
<p>"You must speak with your father, surely if you told him how you feel."</p>
<p>Annika smiled gently at the earnest look on Lord Beyla's handsome face. "Most men don't care to really listen to a woman speak."</p>
<p>"I assure you I am like no man you have ever met."</p>
<p>B'Elanna was about to press her point when they were interrupted by a slightly older woman calling Annika's name.</p>
<p>"Lady Annika, I have been looking all over the ship for you.  Your father was concerned," the auburn haired woman said as she hurried up to where they were standing.</p>
<p>"Lord Beyla has been helping me overcome my seasickness Katherine, there is no need for concern."</p>
<p>"Your father wishes to see you.  I'm to bring you to him now milady," the handmaiden said.</p>
<p>Annika smiled once again into B'Elanna's eyes as she reluctantly removed the cloak from around her shoulders and handed it back.</p>
<p>"I must be going My Lord.  Thank you for your kind assistance."</p>
<p>B'Elanna had no words so simply kissed the hand of the beautiful lady and watched as she walked away with her lady in waiting fussing over her.</p>
<p>Try as she might B'Elanna never saw Annika again until they docked at Dover.  She was waiting with Harry for their horses to be unloaded when the Lady and her entire family and their servants walked by on their way to the inn.  B'Elanna watched intently as they passed but her only reward was a slight sideward glance from Annika as she passed.  Once again her heart raced out of control at the mere sight of the beautiful young woman.</p>
