<!-- We'll Always Have Paris \ Chapter 5 -->

<p>Working with Seven was awkward at first.  B'Elanna was both embarrassed at her outburst and still harbouring some residual traces of anger toward the young drone.  Seven, for her part, was overeager to make up for her mistakes, and in her attempts to anticipate B'Elanna's every need often got in the way of the engineer's efforts.  Neither one of them seemed to be able to speak up and clear the air, so as day progressed into night they drifted further apart both physically and mentally until they were no longer speaking.</p>

<p>Finally after 10 straight hours B'Elanna had had enough.</p>

<p>"Seven, I think we should call it a day.  I need to pick up Kate and get something to eat, and I suspect you need to regenerate."  B'Elanna was packing up her tools as she spoke.  "Let's meet back here in 8 hours and finish this off then."</p>

<p>"Acceptable," Seven answered in her most Borg-like drone.</p>

<p>B'Elanna didn't like leaving things like this, but she really needed to get her daughter.  So she wished Seven a good night and headed off to the bridge.</p>

<p>She pressed the chime to the captain's ready room and was surprised to hear several voices within.  Upon being invited she entered to find the captain, the doctor and Harry Kim all outdoing themselves trying to entertain Kate.  The infant was obviously enjoying all of the attention, and the ready room looked only slightly the worse for wear.  B'Elanna was relieved when the captain informed her that Kate had enough babysitting volunteers to last until they reached the Alpha quadrant, and so it was with a light heart that she returned to her quarters.</p>

<p>Since Kate had already been fed and bathed B'Elanna had nothing to do but play with her child once she returned to her quarters.  They were in a state of complete disorder as a result of the shaking the ship took during the battle.  Several of the glass objects had been broken and the young engineer hurried to clean it up before allowing her daughter to play on the floor.  She was enjoying this time alone with her daughter, but the feeling was marred by a sense of something missing.  B'Elanna had to admit that her quarters seemed much homier and happier when Seven was around.</p>

<p>Finally having had enough of feeling unsettled about the situation between her and her friend, she picked up Kate and said, "Do you want to go for a little walk and see if we can find Seven."</p>

<p>Kate's only answer was to burble happily and drool so B'Elanna took that as a yes and went off in search of her friend.</p>

<p>She stopped by Astrometrics first thinking that it would be like Seven to have stayed working even after everyone else left, but only the Gamma shift was in evidence there so she headed to Cargo Bay 2.  Upon entering she was surprised to find Seven lying on the floor in front of the regeneration chambers with a blanket pulled over her.</p>

<p>"Seven, what's going on, what are you doing on the floor?"</p>

<p>"There was a power surge in the regeneration chambers during the attack.  They will require repair and more power than is available before I can attempt a regeneration cycle again," the young drone explained.</p>

<p>"So you decided to sleep on the floor?"</p>

<p>"I have no where else to go."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you just come to my quarters?"  B'Elanna inquired, almost afraid that she wasn't going to like the answer to the question.</p>

<p>"I was afraid after today that I would not be welcome.  I fear I have irreparably damaged our friendship."  Once again the young drone appeared to be close to tears.</p>

<p>"Seven, I'm sorry.  I know I was angry, and I still think I had a right to be, but that doesn't mean that our friendship is over.  Friends sometimes fight, its all a part of becoming an emotional being. To be honest I came up here looking for you because it just seemed kind of lonely in my quarters without you around.  Why don't you come home with me and stay until we get your alcove running again.  We should be done with the sensors tomorrow and then we can have a look at it."</p>

<p>Seven got to her feet, and shyly accepted B'Elanna's offer.  She was shocked at the state of B'Elanna's quarters when they finally reached them.  B'Elanna had only taken the time to pick up the sharp bits and the rest of room was still in complete disarray.  Noticing Seven staring at her she began to feel self-conscious.</p>

<p>"Seven, what is it?  Why are you staring at me?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry.  I did not intend to be rude. I was unaware of how angry you must have been with me to destroy your quarters in this fashion."</p>

<p>"Destroy my&#133;honestly Seven, you think I did this to my own quarters?  For crying out loud this happened during the battle.  Remember, the whole no inertial dampers, big explosions thing that happened recently.  I just haven't been back here since it happened to clean up."</p>

<p>"I apologize Lieutenant, I seem to be unable to say the right thing around you today.  Perhaps it would be best if I left."</p>

<p>B'Elanna felt a surge of frustration at Seven's insecurities.  Why did things always have to be so difficult.  Seeing how sad the young drone looked and realizing how inexperienced she was with emotions and friendships however caused her to calm down and attempt to discuss the situation with the younger woman.</p>

<p>"Seven, I don't want you to go, but I <b>do </b>want you to call me B'Elanna.  This is kind of hard for me to explain since I don't have tons of practice in the friendship area either, but I do know that friends, lovers, husbands, wives, they all occasionally fight, and then they make up and go on. You know me Seven, I have a terrible temper at the best of times.  I'm going to lose it from time to time and so are you. I just really would like for you to trust our friendship and not retreat every time something a little difficult comes up.  The one thing I know for sure is that when things get tough emotionally we should run <b>to</b> the people we love, not run from them."</p>

<p>"I will attempt to comply Lieu, B'Elanna."  Seven was feeling terribly shy, but was also relieved that B'Elanna seemed willing to work out their difficulties.  She had never seen this side of the Lieutenant before and while it confused her it also comforted her.</p>

<p>"Let me try to clean some of this up so you can relax out here," said B'Elanna as she began to tidy up the living room.</p>

<p>"Allow me to assist you B'Elanna," said Seven as she picked up Kate and began to get her ready for bed.</p>

<p>Once Kate was asleep and her quarters were back in some semblance of order B'Elanna helped Seven make up the couch for sleeping.  She brought out the clothes she had previously lent Seven for sleeping purposes and left the room while Seven changed her clothes.  She got ready for bed, tidying up the mess in her bedroom while she changed, and then went back into the living room to say goodnight to Seven.</p>

<p>The young drone was already lying down under the covers.  She looked so young and helpless and B'Elanna felt the now-familiar ache of protectiveness in her hearts.  She crossed the room and sat on the edge of the sofa, gazing down into Seven's face. She brushed a stray lock of flaxen hair out of Seven's eyes and asked,</p>
<p>"Is there anything you need Seven?"</p>

<p>Seven found herself unable to answer the question because her mind was immediately flooded with a multitude of answers.  There was so much that she needed, and she was beginning to see that B'Elanna was the only one who could fulfill those needs.  In the end she settled for merely shaking her head.</p>

<p>"Well, goodnight then," whispered B'Elanna.  She gave Seven's shoulder a reassuring squeeze before she stood up and went to bed.</p>


<p>The next day they finished fixing the sensor array and Seven began to run sweeps of the upcoming systems to augment any information that the away team might pick up on their mission.  Once the sweeps were running B'Elanna suggested that they turn their attention to the alcoves; she was surprised when Seven declined her offer and instead suggested that work on other malfunctioning systems.  The young drone argued that her need for the regeneration alcoves was much less than it used to be and that their time could be better spent elsewhere.  The truth was that she was reluctant to return to the Cargo Bay; she was enjoying the sense of humanity that sleeping afforded her.</p>


<p>For the next two days B'Elanna and Seven spent every second of every day in one another's company.  They took their meals together with Kate, even though meals for the adults mostly consisted of emergency rations to supplement the food that Neelix had stored on board.  They worked side by side all day and returned to B'Elanna's quarters at night.  They had fallen into an easy routine and found that as they worked they could easily anticipate one another's requirements&#133;sometimes offering tools or assistance even before the other person knew they needed it.</p>

<p>By the end of the second day they were running out of things to do.  It wasn't that there weren't massive repairs that still needed doing, but that they had essentially run out of raw materials and power to effect the repairs.  They were both on the bridge tinkering with the science consoles, more to occupy their time than anything else, when Voyager was hailed by the cheerful voice of Tom Paris.  When Harry brought his image up on screen he was smiling broadly, as was Neelix.</p>

<p>"Captain, you are not going to believe how lucky we just got," the cheerful helmsman shouted.</p>

<p>There wasn't a single person on the bridge who didn't cringe at those words. The randy young Lieutenant was more than capable of telling risqu&eacute; stories over subspace no matter who was on the bridge.</p>

<p>The Captain broke the silence, "I'm almost afraid to ask Lieutenant."</p>

<p>"What, oh&#133;no not that kind of lucky&#133;I mean you should see this place&#133;it is amazing. It has everything we need and more.  The inhabitants are friendly, and there are more than enough facilities to do the repairs."</p>

<p>"And they trusted us enough to load the Flyer with supplies just on my word alone that we would make good," interrupted Neelix, clearly happy with himself.</p>

<p>"Excellent work you two.  What have you got?" The Captain queried.</p>

<p>"It would be easier to show you when we arrive&#133;which should be in just over an hour."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess we'll just have to be patient then," the Captain joked.  She looked more relaxed than she had in days.</p>

<p>Word of the away team's success spread like wildfire over the ship and many of the crewmembers found a reason to be in the landing bay when the Flyer returned.</p>

<p>Tom opened the door and leapt out like a returning hero, raising his arms in mock acceptance of the adulation he imagined.  The crew gathered round to listen as Paris and Neelix began to regal all listeners with tales of their triumphs.</p>

<p>In the end it turned out that they had brought back enough dilithium to power the ship fully until they reached the planet where they had already arranged for a full load to be taken on.  They had also managed to scrounge enough raw materials so that replicators could be used and for added measure had brought some very tasty looking food that Neelix was ready to prepare.  The crew had been eating emergency rations for long enough now that they were thrilled at the thought of anything the Talaxian might come up with.</p>

<p>Tom bounded over to B'Elanna when he caught sight of her.  His grin was infectious and she found herself smiling up at him as he began to speak,</p>

<p>"You won't believe it Lanna, there's enough fuel and material to rebuild Voyager twice.  Repairs will be no problem.  They have a space dock we can use; we won't even have to ground the ship.  Wait'll you see it, it will be almost as good as pulling into Utopia Planetia for repairs."  He was so enthusiastic that he picked the young half-Klingon up in his arms and spun her around until they were both dizzy.</p>

<p>"Alright already, let me down flyboy," she laughed as Tom set her back on her feet.  "You did good Tom."</p>

<p>"I know&#133;sometimes I even amaze myself," he joked.  "Speaking of which, how about I take Kate for the night, I missed her while I was gone."</p>

<p>"Sure Tom, I know she'd love to spend some time with dear old Dad.  She's in the captain's ready room right now&#133;. You might have to get in line to play with her."</p>

<p>Tom raised an eyebrow at that, "Ok, if you say so.  I think I'll head down there now.  See you later Lanna."</p>

<p>B'Elanna helped supervise the unloading of the dilithium and headed down to engineering to oversee getting it stored properly.  Without repairs to the nacelles there was no way they were going to warp any time soon, but it felt good to know that they had enough crystals to last for some time, and that there were more on the way.  It also meant that they could get to work on some of the other systems that had been neglected for lack of power.  She went into her office and began to set up duty rosters for the next few days in order to get as much done as possible before they arrived at the space dock.</p>

<p>Seven was standing nervously outside of B'Elanna's office.  She had witnessed the scene between B'Elanna and Tom in the landing bay, and while she knew there was no chance of a reconciliation between them she had been startled to feel a surge of jealousy sweep over her when Paris had picked her up in his arms.  She was nervous now because she knew that B'Elanna would have her quarters to herself this evening.  She was afraid that B'Elanna would want to be alone.  Without Kate there perhaps the young engineer wouldn't want her company.  Seven also knew that there was no longer a plausible excuse to keep them from repairing her regeneration alcove.  She did not want to be apart from the young Lieutenant, especially not now when she was finally beginning to understand what it was she felt for B'Elanna.</p>

<p>Plucking up her courage she entered B'Elanna's office and sat in the chair across from the young Chief just as she had done many times over the past few days.</p>

<p>B'Elanna looked up and smiled at her friend,  "hey, where did you get to all of a sudden?"</p>

<p>"I had some things to take care of in Astrometrics," Seven replied hoping that B'Elanna wouldn't press for details since she had none to give her.</p>

<p>"Good news about the supplies and the planet eh Seven?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, it will be a relief to have the ship in working order again."</p>

<p>"Yup, I'm just finishing up the duty roster for the next few days and then I'm gonna knock off and have a real meal."</p>

<p>Seven smiled at B'Elanna's obvious delight, but was unsure of what to say and so remained silent.</p>

<p>"Tom is taking Kate for the night, so I think I'll replicate a huge meal and eat in my quarters."</p>

<p>Again the silence stretched between them.</p>

<p>B'Elanna was hoping to avoid asking the question outright, but Seven did not appear to be taking any of her hints, so she was forced to the more direct route.</p>

<p>"Do you want to have dinner with me Seven?"</p>

<p>"Are you sure you wouldn't rather have the time to be alone.  I know that you very seldom have that luxury any more.  With Kate gone for the night you could have your quarters to yourself if you wanted.  I can find another place to stay tonight if you'd like."</p>

<p>B'Elanna looked deeply into Seven's eyes, "What I'd like is to have dinner with you in my quarters tonight Seven."</p>

<p>The young drone felt her face suffuse with colour, her cheeks were burning as she replied, "I would very much like that B'Elanna."</p>

<p>B'Elanna finished the duty roster and then the two of them made sure that the replication systems were online and fully stocked with raw material before they headed back to B'Elanna's quarters.</p>


<p>They both showered and changed when they reached the quarters, B'Elanna into jeans and a tee shirt and Seven into another of her biosuits.  B'Elanna replicated a bottle of Chardonnay, pulling the cork and pouring while they discussed what to replicate for dinner.  They got a little carried away after so many days of emergency rations and had a very eclectic meal of roast chicken, hamburgers and pasta primavera.  When the meal was over they were both stuffed and they lolled on the sofa unable to muster up energy for anything else.</p>

<p>"Its kind of strange without Kate here isn't it?"  B'Elanna remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is rather quiet.  Do you miss her?"</p>

<p>"Sure I miss her, I mean, I'm happy for the break and everything, but this place seems empty without her.  I'm really glad that you're here Seven."</p>

<p>"As am I B'Elanna."</p>

<p>"Maybe I should read you a story before bed," B'Elanna joked.</p>

<p>"I would like that."</p>

<p>B'Elanna looked at Seven to see if the young drone was joking, but Seven looked completely serious.</p>

<p>"You mean it, you really want me to read to you?"</p>

<p>"I find it very soothing when I hear you read to Kate, I have one memory of my mother reading to me aboard the Raven.  It is a pleasant memory, so yes, I believe I would like you to read to me."</p>

<p>"OK, name your story."</p>

<p>"I believe we should get ready for bed first&#133;.is that not proper procedure?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely, can't neglect the rules now can we," B'Elanna teased.</p>

<p>The two of them changed into their pajamas and Seven made up the sofa and then crawled under the covers.  B'Elanna picked up a book and came to sit on the edge of the couch beside Seven's recumbent body.</p>

<p>"What do you want to hear?"</p>

<p>"I wish to hear 'In Which Tigger Comes to the Forest and Has Breakfast.'" Seven said in a small tired voice.</p>

<p>"My favourite," said B'Elanna as she began to read.  She was no more than three pages into the tale when Seven drifted off to sleep with a sweet smile on her lips.  B'Elanna bent down and gently kissed the beautiful woman's forehead, shaking her head in disbelief at her own sentimentality before she made her way to her own bed.</p>


<p>The next morning's senior staff meeting had an entirely different tenor than the previous few.  Everyone was clean, rested and in a good mood.  Tom and Neelix in particular were practically vibrating with excitement.  The Captain called the meeting to order and the department heads made quick assessments of their progress with repairs and made projections for future progress based on the amount of power and raw material available to them.  Paris gave a report of facilities available in the Kintari system and Neelix provided an exhaustive list of supplies that were available so that department heads could prepare lists of supplies and equipment which they would like to obtain.</p>

<p>After the routine discussions were over B'Elanna noticed Paris and Neelix nudging one another like children, each daring the other to go first.  Finally the Captain, who obviously knew what was going on, urged Mr. Paris to speak up.  To no one's surprise he proposed a holodeck party to celebrate their good fortune.  It appeared that he and Neelix had stocked up on some special supplies and were anxious to have a 'theme' party to mark the occasion. The Captain had heard their ideas and approved only because they made a good argument for people needing a release after all they had been through in the past few days.  Since it would take three days to reach Kintari at impulse power they felt a party the next night would make sense and interfere very little with repairs.</p>

<p>"Sorry to burst your bubble Tom, but the holodecks are still offline," B'Elanna said, smiling indulgently at her ex-husband's ever-present enthusiasm for a good party.</p>

<p>"I understand it wasn't a priority Lieutenant, but now that our future seems secure I believe we can spare you to work on the holodecks for today.  We have sufficient power for all systems now, and frankly I think we could all use a good laugh.  We are going to be awfully busy when we reach Kintari so we might as well enjoy ourselves a bit while we can," the Captain came to Tom's defense.</p>

<p>B'Elanna shook her head, but secretly agreed that a party might actually be in order for a change.  "All right Captain&#133;I'll get on it after the meeting."</p>

<p>She dropped by engineering to check on her crew's progress, and once she was pleased with what she saw she grabbed a toolkit and headed to the holodecks.  The damage was relatively minor, but labour intensive.  Ordinarily she would have assigned someone else to the problem, but she was enjoying a little mindless labour just now.  She replaced several holo-emitters and three burned out gelpacks before she turned to the problem of the power flow.  The power fluctuation took several hours to trace and several more to fix.  It was dinnertime before she looked up to even notice that she had missed lunch.  She quickly started a diagnostic, promising herself to come back and check on it before she went to bed, and then headed to the messhall.</p>

<p>She was not surprised to find her daughter once more in the arms of Seven.  Tom was actually in the messhall but he was so enraptured with the plans he and Neelix were making that he had gladly allowed Seven to take over caring for his daughter.  B'Elanna got her food and joined Seven at her table.</p>

<p>Seven was feeling a bit sad.  She had spent the day repairing her alcove, and knew that tonight she would need to regenerate.  She was going to miss spending the evening with B'Elanna and Kate, but there was no avoiding the fact that she was still reliant on her alcove for some of her body's needs.  She was pleased to have been able to go so long with no ill effects, but her nanoprobes and implants needed recharging and since she wished to attend the party tomorrow she decided that tonight was the night.</p>

<p>She smiled happily when B'Elanna took her seat across the table.  They chatted happily about work and some shield modifications they had been researching before the devastation of the battle.  They were hoping to be able to incorporate the modifications into the repairs they would be making once they were in space dock.</p>

<p>When dinner was over they walked to the turbolift together, and B'Elanna was surprised to hear Seven order the lift to Cargo Bay 2.</p>

<p>"You aren't coming with us?"  She asked, surprised at how disappointed she was by that fact.</p>

<p>"My alcove is repaired, and I require a period of regeneration this evening," Seven replied in her familiar Borg monotone.</p>

<p>B'Elanna knew that tone of voice meant that Seven was as unhappy about that fact as she was, and somehow this made her feel a bit better.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess this is goodnight," she said as the lift stopped on Seven's deck.</p>

<p>Seven smiled wanly, she desperately wanted to remain in the company of her friend.  She leaned forward and placed a kiss on Kate's forehead before she wished them both good night and left the lift.</p>

<p>"Aren't you the lucky one," B'Elanna said to her daughter as she kissed her forehead in the same spot where Seven's lips had been only seconds before.</p>


<p>The next day went by in a blur of work and party preparations.  Tom and Neelix had sent messages to the crew to outline the theme of the party and what costumes were considered appropriate. Tom had also informed B'Elanna that he had arranged for Kate to be looked after tonight by the same person who was babysitting Naomi Wildman.</p>

<p>B'Elanna looked through the small catalogue of costumes that Tom had created and shook her head. 'I don't think so Paris, not this Klingon,' she thought to herself.  She replicated a costume for herself and smiled at the thought of what Tom would have to say when he saw her.</p>

<p>By the time B'Elanna was ready for the party it had already been going on for a half-hour and almost everyone was already in attendance.  Seven had not been able to stop watching the doors to the holodeck, as she was terribly anxious to see B'Elanna; they had barely had time to speak all day.  The young drone was feeling a little self-conscious in her outfit, although almost every other woman there was dressed in a similar fashion.  Even Captain Janeway was wearing the long dress and bustle of a female of the Ancient West era.</p>

<p>Paris was wearing an all white costume with large flapping chaps and an oversized cowboy hat.  He wore two six shooters on his belt and a tin star on his chest designated him 'sheriff.'  Chakotay was dressed as an American Plains Indian in full regalia and looked quite striking.  There were many different variations on the Cowboys and Indians theme of the party, unless you happened to be a woman&#151;then it was long dress, bustle, and black lace-up boots.  Unless you were a Delaney sister and Tom had explained to you what Burlesque girls wore during that era.</p>

<p>Finally Seven's vigilance was rewarded when the doors to the holodeck opened and B'Elanna entered the room.  The young drone felt her heart begin to pound and her stomach constrict at the sight of the young engineer.  Even Tom Paris couldn't manage anything more coherent than 'Wow.'</p>

<p>B'Elanna was clad almost entirely in black leather.  Her chaps were tight fitting, with a slight fringe, and her dark crimson silk shirt was covered with a tight black leather vest.  She was wearing a black cowboy hat with silver rowels around the hatband.  She wore a single pistol low on her hip, a black neckerchief tied in front, and she swaggered in her cowboy boots in a manner that was palpably sensuous.</p>

<p>Seven could barely breathe as B'Elanna sashayed right up to her.</p>

<p>"Nice dress Seven," she teased archly.</p>

<p>Seven blushed furiously, but was unable to come up with anything to say that she didn't immediately dismiss as nonsense.</p>

<p>Tom Paris saved them from the ensuing awkward silence by coming up and teasing B'Elanna about having upstaged his costume.  He then described the food and entertainment in detail.</p>

<p>"We've got it all, a barbecue, beans, the whole nine yards.  Later we'll have dancing&#133;its going to be great," he enthused.</p>

<p>The captain came up at that moment and after complimenting B'Elanna on her outfit, secretly jealous that she hadn't thought of the idea herself, she engaged Seven in a long conversation.  Once the doctor, dressed as what looked to B'Elanna like an undertaker, joined in the conversation B'Elanna gradually lost interest and drifted around the room, chatting with various people.</p>

<p>The dancing began after people had a chance to eat and consume several of the whiskey shots that Tom and Neelix were recommending.  The first few dances were authentic Western dances of the era, and although people struggled gamely it was a failing effort.  Finally Tom relented and programmed in some country music from the late twentieth century.  Finally people began to relax and the dance floor quickly filled up.</p>

<p>Seven, who was still deep in conversation with the captain and the doctor, noticed B'Elanna dancing with Harry Kim. Her movements were athletic and sensuous as she swayed to the music and Seven once again found herself having difficulty breathing.  B'Elanna was twisting her body around Harry's, dancing in front and behind him, constantly in contact with his body; Harry was grinning like an idiot and enjoying every minute of it.  He and B'Elanna were old friends and their comfort level with one another allowed them freedoms they wouldn't dare with others.</p>

<p>Finally it was Tom who cut in and swept B'Elanna into a two-step around the dance floor.  He was a good dancer in his own right, but no one came close to the power and grace that B'Elanna exhibited as she moved.</p>

<p>When the song ended B'Elanna headed to the bar and downed a shot or two of whiskey before she headed out to find Seven.  She found her exactly where she left her, still listening to the Captain and the doctor.  B'Elanna approached and removed her hat, bowing low and offering her hand to the young drone she drawled,</p>

<p>"Pardon me Ma'am, but could I have the honour of this dance?"</p>

<p>Seven nodded demurely and took the proffered arm, allowing herself to be led to the dance floor.  She had taken many dance lessons with the doctor, but this type of dancing was something the hologram had considered beneath his dignity, so she was unsure of what to expect.</p>

<p>The song was of a medium speed and B'Elanna immediately began to move her body to the beat.  Seven stood awkwardly for a moment before B'Elanna caught on to her difficulties.</p>

<p>"Just listen to the music, try to feel the beat and just move to it.  There aren't any rules Seven, just do what you feel."</p>

<p>The young Klingon moved closer and placed her hands lightly on Seven's hips, guiding her into rhythm with the beat.  Seven closed her eyes and let the music and the feeling of B'Elanna's hands on her body sweep over her and she gradually relaxed and began to dance.</p>

<p>The next song was slightly faster and had a more definite beat.  Seven watched as B'Elanna moved away, eyes closed completely lost in the music.  She was having an easier time of it now, but the sight of B'Elanna's powerful frame moving so gracefully in front of her was having a potent effect on the young drone; the sight of B'Elanna dancing intoxicated her senses and made her dizzy with emotion.</p>

<p>Every song seemed to be about love or heartbreak.  All the words seemed applicable to Seven's situation and she felt the music more powerfully because of it.  Finally a song began playing that B'Elanna appeared to know.  Seven heard the young Klingon singing in a husky contralto as she moved to the beat.</p>

<p>Loving you<br>
Isn't really something I should do<br>
Shouldn't want to spend my time with you<br>
I should try to be strong<br>
But baby you're the right kind of wrong</p>

<p>Say my name and I can't fight it anymore<br>
Oh I know I should go<br>
But I need your touch just too damn much</p>

<p>Seven moved closer as they danced, until their bodies were mere centimeters apart.  Now it was Seven's turn to place her hands on B'Elanna's hips. She smiled slightly as B'Elanna continued to sing with the music.</p>

<p>I should try to run but I just can't seem to<br>
Every time I run you're the one that I run to.<br>
You walk in and my strength walks out the door<br>
Say my name and I can't fight it anymore</p>

<p>Loving you<br>
Isn't really something I should do<br>
Shouldn't want to spend my time with you<br>
I should try to be strong<br>
But baby you're the right kind of wrong</p>

<p>The song ended and they drifted apart, standing awkwardly in the silence.  Neither one of them knew what to do or say, and so it was something of a relief when Harry and Tom came up and began talking to them. The two young men had been drinking heavily and were in high spirits.  They insisted on dancing with both Seven and B'Elanna, and for the rest of the evening they were never alone together for a moment.  Harry and Tom even insisted on walking them both home, so when they arrived at the Cargo Bay B'Elanna could only smile and wish Seven a good night, before the two drunken friends pulled her away to escort her home.  She had trouble convincing them both that it wasn't a good idea to come in for a nightcap, and it was several minutes of good-natured arguing before they headed off to their quarters.  She briefly considered walking back to the cargo bay to talk to Seven, but it was late and she decided that she didn't know what she would say anyway, so she reluctantly went to bed.</p>
