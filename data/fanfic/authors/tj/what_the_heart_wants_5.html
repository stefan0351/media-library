<!-- What the Heart Wants \ Chapter 5 -->

<p>B'Elanna Torres warrior, Klingon, chief engineer of the Federation Starship Voyager, former Maquis and survivor of the Cardassian prison camps was terrified.  She was confused and scared and would rather do anything in the world than leave her quarters and attend the morning senior staff meeting.  The reason for her terror was also the source of her confusion and her head was splitting as she tried to negotiate the unfamiliar waters of emotions and feelings.  Give her something to fix or kill, give her a fight that had rules, an objective and a clear winner or loser and she was in her element.  This, however, was different.</p>
<p>It had become quite clear to her that she was attracted to Seven of Nine, the ship's Astrometrics officer and resident ex-Borg.  The thing was she also really liked Seven&#133;over the past few weeks she had come to value her newfound friendship with the younger woman.  Yesterday they had shared an intensely emotional experience together as they showed one another painful incidents from their childhoods and had explored the dual nature of both of their lives.  At the movies that night, when Seven's leg had come to rest against her own, B'Elanna felt a fire she thought would forever be denied her.  She had never felt that kind of molten fever before, not with anyone.  But Seven was so childlike in so many ways &#133;there was no telling if she knew the effect she had on B'Elanna, and there was certainly no reason for B'Elanna to believe that Seven would return her feelings.</p>
<p>So here she was on the horns of a dilemma&#133;reveal her attraction and ruin the friendship&#133;no that was unacceptable.  Equally unacceptable was the thought of not taking the chance that Seven might reciprocate those feelings. If all of this weren't bad enough, B'Elanna's honour wouldn't allow her to keep such a secret from someone for whom she cared deeply.  She felt like she needed to get a handle on this before she saw Seven again&#133;which would be in about 10 minutes at the senior staff meeting.  'Shit, Shit, Shit, life was certainly easier when I kept myself to myself,' she grumbled to herself as she prepared to leave for the meeting.  Feelings or no feelings she had a job to do.</p>
<p>B'Elanna hurried to the meeting and as she went old habits reasserted themselves with a vengeance.  The only emotion in her life that had never failed her was anger. She knew anger well; it was the cloak with which she hid her fragile emotions and the armour with which she protected her heart.  The closer she got to the meeting the more she convinced herself that she was angry at Seven for daring to breach the carefully constructed walls that protected her heart and for bringing all of this confusion, this emotional mess, into her otherwise orderly life.  B'Elanna had a lifetime of experience with using her anger to protect herself, and by the time she got to the conference room she was convinced that she was furious with Seven for tricking her into revealing more than she wanted to about herself and her life.  She was certain she was better off without the Borg in her life. She would just ignore her, cut her dead and go back to the way they were before the day Seven intruded on her private grief in the holodeck.</p>
<p>The doors to the conference room opened and the first, the only, thing B'Elanna saw was Seven of Nine sitting in a chair on the opposite side of the table.  The angry young engineer looked her straight in the eye and prepared herself to turn away without even acknowledging the Borg's existence when Seven smiled at her. A brilliant, beautiful smile that lit up the young woman's normally inscrutable face, and brought an answering grin from B'Elanna in a heartbeat. 'Oh, Kahless you are so much trouble Torres,' she chided herself as she walked around the table to claim the empty chair beside Seven.</p>
<p>"Good morning B'Elanna," Seven's voice was pitched so low that only B'Elanna could have heard the words, and when she did she felt a flush creep over her face.</p>
<p>The young engineer clamped down on her raging emotions with every bit of Klingon control at her disposal, and whispered "Morning Seven." </p>
<p>The meeting seemed to drone on interminably and by the end of it neither the chief engineer nor the ship's usually infallible astrometrics officer could have recalled a single item that had been discussed.</p>
<p>As they left the room Seven walked beside B'Elanna, and when they were out of earshot of the rest of the crew she began shyly, "Lieut&#133;.B'Elanna, I wish to thank you for yesterday.  I had a wonderful time.  I am pleased that we could facilitate our friendship by sharing our emotional responses to our childhoods."</p>
<p>B'Elanna could tell how nervous Seven was by the way she fell back into Borg-speak to cover the extent of her emotions.  She was just about to reply when Seven spoke again, almost in a whisper. "Did you mean what you said?"</p>
<p>"About what Seven?"  They were stopped in the corridor now, facing each other.  "That this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship."  Seven didn't breathe until she saw B'Elanna smile.</p>
<p>"Of course I meant it Seven.  Did you think I would lie about something like that?"</p>
<p>"Never," Seven replied vehemently.  "I merely thought that once you had a chance to think about it you would change your mind and not wish to be friends with&#133;. someone like me." 'Some <b>thing</b> like me,' Seven thought bitterly to herself.</p>
<p>"You mean someone brilliant, caring and wonderful?"  B'Elanna queried.  "Yeah why would I want to be friends with someone like that," she grinned at Seven?</p>
<p>"You truly believe that I am those things?"  Seven couldn't believe what she was hearing.</p>
<p>"I'm not really given to saying things I don't mean Seven."</p>
<p>"No you are not."  Seven couldn't keep the smile off her face, and B'Elanna was certain she'd never seem such a beautiful sight before in her life. She was also certain that if they stood in the hallway smiling like this much longer no amount of Klingon control was going to stop her from doing something she might regret.  </p>
<p>"We'd better get to work Seven&#133;this ship can't get along without us you know," B'Elanna joked to mask her embarrassment at exhibiting her emotions so publicly.</p>
<p>Seven cocked her optical implant. "Indeed&#133;. I should analyze the sensor readings from yesterdays scans."  </p>
<p>The two friends reluctantly parted as they began their duty shifts.</p>
<p>Seven found that by concentrating intensely she could manage to put last night out of her mind for up to 10 minutes at a stretch, during which time she worked furiously at her analysis of yesterday's scans.  She was unfamiliar with the sensation of not being in total control of her thoughts.  She felt positively&#133;scattered.  Her analysis had already taken an hour longer than it should have, and for the first time she cursed her eidetic memory.  Unbidden, her mind would flash back to yesterday, and how it felt to hold the sobbing engineer in her arms, how it felt when they brushed against one another in the darkened theatre, and how it felt when B'Elanna had wrapped her arm around her waist and quoted the line from the movie.  She could hear every word and feel every sensation and she had to lean against her console to stop her knees from giving out from underneath her.  She looked down at her console and realized that she had been lost in thought yet once more for over 15 minutes.  Annoyed with her lack of discipline she returned to her work.</p>
<p>Finally after another hour Seven was finished her work.  She transferred the results of her scans to Ops and sent a copy to the Captain.  She hesitated a moment to ensure that her voice was under control and then she tapped her Comm badge.</p>
<p>&lt;Seven of Nine to Torres&gt;</p>
<p>B'Elanna started up at the sound of Seven's disembodied voice over the comm.  She had also been unable to concentrate on her work this morning.  She had several reports to complete, and each time she began to fill out the forms, her mind would begin to wander. No matter what she did, her mind would always bring her back to Seven.  It took her a second to realize that Seven was actually talking to her and that, for once this morning, she wasn't daydreaming.</p>
<p>&lt;Go ahead Seven&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;I have finished my duties in Astrometrics and wish to know if you require any assistance in Engineering&gt;</p>
<p>A plan began forming in B'Elanna's mind and she smiled to herself as she replied.</p>
<p>&lt;Absolutely Seven, whenever you're ready&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;On my way, Seven out&gt;</p>
<p>B'Elanna left her office and spoke to Vorik for a few minutes.  While he was relived that he would not have to be the one to repair the blown plasma conduit in the aft nacelle, he was a little surprised to hear the Chief volunteer to do the dirty work. It was no secret that the Chief enjoyed hands on work much more than her more esoteric duties, but crawling through all those Jefferies tubes to one of the filthiest places on the ship seemed a bit overboard even for the Chief.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna was immensely pleased with herself.  If she couldn't concentrate on her paperwork at least she could be productive, and spend some time alone with Seven.  A most efficient plan. </p>
<p>"Your plan seems most inefficient," Seven looked at B'Elanna with her implant cocked.  She could not believe what B'Elanna was proposing. "It does not require the combined skillset of two of the best engineers onboard Voyager to repair a damaged plasma conduit.  Our attentions would be better off directed somewhere else."</p>
<p>B'Elanna was at a loss as to how to explain herself.  She had forgotten that she was dealing with Seven of Nine and her implacable logic.  "Umm, Its just that&#133;Well being in the nacelle&#133;it's a really important conduit&#133;if anything were to happen before it was repaired&#133;well&#133;" B'Elanna's voice trailed off.  There was just no way she was going to be able to get out of this one.  She was about to back down when she a look flash over Seven's face.</p>
<p>"Of course.  I understand.  We should proceed immediately."</p>
<p>B'Elanna couldn't believe her luck, or Seven's abrupt change of mind, but she wasn't about to argue.  She gathered up the necessary tools and led the way out of engineering, trying very hard to keep a satisfied smile off her face.</p>
<p>Seven understood that B'Elanna simply wanted to spend time alone with her; she was less certain as to the reasons why.  Seven's growing attraction to the petite engineer led her to hope that B'Elanna might reciprocate those feelings, and her transparent ploy to allow them to be alone was giving fuel to the flames of hope that were flickering in Seven's heart.  But as Seven had only limited experience with friendship and none at all with love, she wasn't able to interpret the signals B'Elanna exhibited.  She was unsure as to whether the beautiful young Klingon was seeking friendship or something more.  Her own self-loathing about her Borg nature led her to believe it would be impossible for someone as warm and vibrant and alive as B'Elanna to care for a cold emotionless drone like herself.  And yet still she hoped&#133; </p>
<p>It was a long and exhausting climb and crawl to get to the aft nacelle and they were both filthy and exhausted by the time they arrived.  B'Elanna shoved the tools next to the damaged conduit, removed her uniform jacket, and sat down with her back against the bulkhead as she rested a few moments before beginning the work.  The truth was that now that she had Seven all to herself out here she had no clue as to what to say.  He own ulterior motives were getting in the way of the easy friendship the two of them had developed over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Seven, also looking slightly the worse for wear, was crouching in the conduit watching B'Elanna carefully.  She sensed that the older woman was feeling uneasy and feared that already B'Elanna was regretting her overtures of friendship.  To cover her own disappointment Seven began unpacking the tools and removing the access panel to the plasma conduit.</p>
<p>When the cover was open B'Elanna grabbed a tricorder and, flipping onto her back, slid into the access hatch to assess the damage that had been done when the conduit cracked.  She was glad of the fact that she no longer had to look at Seven.  She had seen a look that she was certain had been annoyance cross Seven's face before she had begun to unpack the tools and was worried that the young Borg was less than pleased at having been coerced into this little endeavor.</p>
<p>"Hmm, doesn't look too bad, but it's a good thing we have those extra gelpacks&#133;I think we need to replace at least two of them while we're here.  There seems to be some kind of corrosion at the couplings on two of the packs closest to the conduit."</p>
<p>She handed her tricorder out to Seven and then asked for an isolinear spanner to begin the removal of the conduit.  Seven handed her the tool, careful not to allow contact between their hands, and then she began the work of preparing the new conduit for installment.  It was delicate work and she was glad of the distraction.  It was too easy for her to lose herself in her observations of the Klingon's muscular frame as she worked. B'Elanna had only been wearing her gray Starfleet issue tank top under her uniform jacket and her shapely arms were covered in a sheen of sweat as she worked.  It was most&#133;distracting.  It was clear to her that B'Elanna did not return her affections and she did not wish to dishonour the young woman by observing her body uninvited.</p>
<p>Once the new conduit was installed B'Elanna began to remove the damaged gelpacks.  As she tugged at the first one to free it from its connection, some of the corrosion flaked off and fell into her eyes.</p>
<p>"SHIT!"  She levered herself out of the access hatch and began rubbing her eyes as the tears streamed down her face.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Torres, please stop touching your eyes.  I believe you will damage yourself further."  Seven grabbed B'Elanna's hands away from her face and held them tightly in her own.  "Let me see please," Seven's voice was pleading now and B'Elanna forced herself to sit still.  She wasn't really in much pain, but she had been startled. She began to calm down until she realized just how close she really was to Seven's body.  She felt her heart begin to hammer in her chest.</p>
<p>Seven herself was not unaffected by her close contact with the young engineer.  She took a second to issue a command to her nanoprobes to slow her heartbeat and respiration levels to normal and to stop her hands from trembling as she took B'Elanna's face in her hands and tilted her head back.  She very gently began to remove the debris from her friend's watering eyes.</p>
<p>It took several minutes to complete her task and as she worked she was aware of the sound of B'Elanna's twin hearts beating rapidly.  She heard her sharp intake of breath as Seven touched her face, and she was forced to clamp down on her own reactions to stop her hands from shaking as she carefully worked.</p>
<p>When she was done she held B'Elanna's face in both her hands and watched as the Klingon blinked the last of the tears away.  Finally able to see clearly, B'Elanna found she was looking up into the concerned face of the beautiful Borg.</p>
<p>"I trust you are&#133;undamaged B'Elanna," Seven queried softly, continuing to hold the engineer's face gently in her hands.</p>
<p>"Yeah, thanks Seven&#133;I'm fine now."  B'Elanna made no effort to move away from Seven's touch and the two stayed that way for almost a minute&#133;just looking at each other.</p>
<p>Finally they reluctantly parted and began to finish the repair.  B'Elanna was just replacing the last gelpack and was still unsure as to what to do about Seven. 'Kahless Torres, are you a warrior or a Tikka cat...just ask her already,' she chided herself mentally. </p>
<p>It was not, however, until they had finished packing up the tools that she was able to muster the courage to speak.  "Seven, I, ah, was wondering if you might like to have dinner with me tonight?"</p>
<p>"That would be nice, perhaps we could meet in the messhall after we have had a chance to clean up a little."</p>
<p>"Actually Seven, I was hoping you'd have dinner with me in my quarters."</p>
<p>"That would be lovely," Seven replied as a blush crept over her features.  "I will have to go to Sickbay to use the sonic shower, I could come to your quarters after if you would like."</p>
<p>"You don't have a sonic shower in your quarters?"</p>
<p>"I 'live' in the Cargo Bay, it hardly seems practical to install a shower there, not to mention the fact that crewmembers need access to the room on a regular basis.  It makes more sense to shower in Sickbay."</p>
<p>"No it doesn't&#133;you have as much right to privacy as anyone on board this ship.  It's not right that you have to go all the way to sick bay just to clean up."  B'Elanna was indignant on her friend's behalf.</p>
<p>"I do not mind."</p>
<p>"Well I mind&#133;you can shower at my place tonight if you'd like.  Maybe I should talk to the Captain tomorrow about getting you some quarters.  You should have a place to call your own."</p>
<p>Seven did not see the need for her to have her own quarters, but she was so enchanted at the thought that this time B'Elanna's anger was on her behalf, and not directed at her, that she made no comment.</p>
<p>They made their way back to engineering and Seven replaced the tools while B'Elanna looked over the schedule for the next day and finished the report she had been working on before they left to repair the conduit.  Finally they logged off duty and left engineering together.</p>
<p>When they arrived at her quarters B'Elanna once again removed her uniform jacket and washed her hands as she said, "Why don't you grab a shower first and I'll start dinner, then you can keep an eye on it while I get ready."</p>
<p>Seven looked down at her filthy biosuit. "I do not have anything to change into after I shower," she said.</p>
<p>"Go ahead and replicate whatever you need, or you can borrow something of mine if you'd like."</p>
<p>In truth there was nothing Seven would have liked more than to wear an article of B'Elanna's clothing, but she was still unsure exactly what was going on and so she opted to simply replicate another biosuit before heading in to the bedroom ensuite to take her shower.</p>
<p>B'Elanna began to prepare dinner, working furiously so she wouldn't have time to think about the fact that a beautiful, naked Seven of Nine was just meters away in her sonic shower. She had everything just about ready when Seven emerged from her bedroom looking, as ever, like perfection.</p>
<p>"This will take another half hour or so&#133;just make sure it doesn't get overdone.  I won't be long."</p>
<p>True to her word it was only twenty minutes or so before B'Elanna emerged from the bedroom looking clean, dressed in a pair of tight blue denim pants and a white tee shirt that contrasted nicely with the colour of her skin.</p>
<p>Seven was taken aback by how different B'Elanna looked out of her uniform.  She seemed so much younger, and her powerful frame was so much more evident when it wasn't hidden by the loose fabric of her Starfleet uniform.</p>
<p>Together they set the table.  B'Elanna wanted to light candles and dim the lights but she was unsure of how Seven would react to that.  'Maybe she thinks we're just two friends having dinner together.  I don't even know if she thinks this is a date or not.'  She settled for lighting candles but not dimming the lights.</p>
<p>"Seven, why don't you pick out some music for dinner," she said as she put the finishing touches on dinner.</p>
<p>Seven went to the console and scanned through B'Elanna's personal music files and selected several that she recognized from her own limited exposure to music.  She chose several pieces of music from ancient earth, an art form known as jazz, as well as some more contemporary orchestral pieces.</p>
<p>'Hmm, soft jazz, maybe she knows this is a date after all,' B'Elanna thought to herself.</p>
<p>They chatted throughout dinner, mostly about work however, leading B'Elanna to reassess her reassessment as to whether or not Seven felt they were on an actual date or not.  By the end of the meal B'Elanna still couldn't really tell what Seven was thinking.</p>
<p>After dinner they cleared away the dishes, recycling everything, and then B'Elanna led the way back to the living room and curled up on the couch.  Seven sat on the couch as well, but at the opposite end. 'Well, what did you think Torres, you'd cook one meal and she'd just jump on you the second you sat down.' They continued to chat, but the silences were growing longer, and B'Elanna was feeling uncomfortable.  She had long ago lost the ability to make eye contact with Seven, afraid of bursting into hysterical laughter or worse.  Seven was feeling confused by the obvious tension that was growing between them.  She longed to touch B'Elanna, but it was steadily becoming more difficult for her to even speak.</p>
<p>Finally, when they both moved to put their arms on the back of the couch, their hands met&#133;there was an instant of hesitation when they both froze, but finally they turned to face one another and their eyes locked. Their world seemed at once to expand to encompass the entire galaxy and at the same time contract until all that existed was this gaze.  In one another's eyes they recognized an acknowledgement that if they took the next step, nothing would ever be the same between them.</p>
<p>Time drew out like a blade. The moment stretched to infinity and beyond as they leaned closer, closer still, until their lips were mere inches apart.</p>
<p>"Seven, I&#133;" B'Elanna's voice was a hoarse whisper, filled with unspoken desire.</p>
<p>"Please&#133;" was all Seven could manage in reply.</p>
<p>Finally their lips met&#133;just the barest of brushes; it was like the flashpoint of a fire that has been smoldering forever.  The kiss deepened as they pulled one another closer in the age-old desire for two to become one.  B'Elanna pulled Seven's lower lip into her mouth, sucking on it fiercely then gently nipping it before she let go.  She flicked her tongue out gently seeking an entrance that was instantly granted and gasped as Seven's tongue began a sweet and tortuous dance with her own. </p>
<p>It was as if a dam had burst in Seven&#133;all the feelings and emotions she had tried for so long to deny even existed came flooding out.  She clutched B'Elanna to her&#133;moaning at the sensation of heat and melting she was experiencing.  She let her hands explore B'Elanna's back and shoulders and tangle in her beautiful hair.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna pressed forward, gently pushing Seven down as she reached for her shapely legs and pulled them up onto the couch.  She was now lying on top of Seven, their legs tangling together, and she growled as Seven's hands began to massage the sensitive ridges of her lower back.  </p>
<p>Not content with the amount of access she had, Seven pulled B'Elanna's tee shirt free of her jeans before she slid her hand under the waist band, moaning as she finally came into contact with B'Elanna's burning skin. She let her fingers roam freely over the ridges of B'Elanna's back, exploring each one thoroughly before moving on.  She then trailed her fingers up her lover's pronounced spine, enjoying the feel of B'Elanna's fevered flesh under her hands.</p>
<p>B'Elanna reached up and freed Seven's hair, growling her pleasure as the silky tresses cascaded over her face.  She arched into the contact Seven was making with her back and then eased up onto her elbow so she could free one hand to explore the supple body that was now writhing beneath her on the couch.  She reached back, grasping Seven's slim thigh, sliding her hand firmly up the beautiful body, lightly brushing the side of her ample breast before cupping the young drone's cheek.</p>
<p>The sensation of B'Elanna caressing her starburst implant caused Seven to groan with the pleasure, and she moved her hands down to grasp B'Elanna's behind, pulling her into closer contact. She whimpered as she felt B'Elanna break their kiss, but sighed out loud as she felt the Klingon move to ravish her neck with a searing trail of kisses and nips that ended only when B'Elanna reached her ear and began to nip gently at her earlobe.  The sound of B'Elanna purring in her ear, combined with all of the other sensations, was almost too much for Seven&#133;she closed her eyes feeling dizzy with pleasure.</p>
<p>B'Elanna twisted their bodies so that they were now lying on their sides, and she moved her leg so it was between Seven's thighs.  She felt the drone shudder as she arched into the contact.  She continued ravishing Seven's neck with kisses, moving her hand down to cup her breast, feeling the nipple harden instantly in her palm. </p>
<p>Seven inhaled B'Elanna's scent as she buried her face in the young engineer's neck.  She could hear the distinctive beat of B'Elanna's hearts hammering even over the sound of her purrs.  Unable to restrain herself any longer, Seven reached up and laid her palm over B'Elanna's small, firm breast.  Her nipple was achingly hard and Seven took it in her fingers, rolling her thumb over the top as B'Elanna growled with pleasure.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was rapidly losing the battle with the Klingon side of her personality, which was urging her to go ahead and take the young beauty moaning in her arms.  She reached down, cupping her hand between Seven's legs, rubbing her gently through her clothing.  She heard Seven cry out with pleasure and realized if she didn't slow things down quickly there would be no stopping them.  She knew Seven had no experience, and it was up to her to protect the young woman&#133;even if it meant protecting Seven from B'Elanna herself.  She pressed gently one last time, enjoying the heat radiating from Seven's core, and then slowly wrapped her arms around the young drone.  She kissed her deeply and then slowly, gently moved the young woman away.</p>
<p>Seven whimpered as she felt B'Elanna push her away, she did not want to stop this activity.  At the same time she was grateful B'Elanna was slowing down their headlong rush.  She knew that she wanted to be with B'Elanna, but so much had happened, and so little had been said, she knew they might both regret it if they went any further.  She rested her forehead against B'Elanna's ridges and stole several more kisses before settling down in her lover's arms.</p>
<p>They lay without speaking for a long time, just enjoying the sensation of being held and loved.  Finally, B'Elanna moved her head back so she could look at Seven.  She was amazed, as always, with how beautiful the younger woman was.  </p>
<p>"Wow, Seven. I had no idea&#133;I, are you OK," she cried as she saw the tears shining in Seven's eyes?</p>
<p>"I am happy, and afraid&#133;I have never felt like this before&#133;I&#133;" Seven's voice trailed off as she began to cry quietly.</p>
<p>"Shhh, hush sweetie. Everything is going to be OK.  I'm right here, and I'm not going anywhere."  B'Elanna continued to murmur lovingly to Seven until she felt the young Borg's body began to relax.  Finally the actions and emotions of the day overcame both of them and they drifted off to sleep in one another's arms.</p>
