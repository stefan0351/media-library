<!-- Knight Falls \ Chapter 15 -->

<p>The responsibility of supporting all the members of her new extended family weighed heavily on B'Elanna's shoulders at first.  She was feeling very tense as she struggled to put on her armour with the fumbling help of Annika.  Still she had to admit that it felt very good to think that she and Harry were no longer alone in the world.  She heard Harry and Tom returning to the tent with Goliath already saddled and armed for the day's work.  It had been a long time since she'd heard Harry laugh and joke so freely with someone other than herself and it made her smile to hear he and Tom bantering lightly as they gathered up equipment for the joust.  It occurred to her that while she had more responsibility now than ever before in her life she also had people to share her life with and that fact alone helped ease the burden.  No longer were she and Harry alone responsible for keeping her secret?the burden was spread among the group of friends.  Now that Kate and Tom knew the secret they could truly become friends, as they no longer needed to watch every word they spoke in front of them for fear of discovery.  As happy as she and Harry had been, B'Elanna knew that they had both been feeling a loneliness that came from hiding a secret from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The preparations for the day's events went much more quickly as well.  Normally she would have tidied up the tent and struggled alone with her armour before heading to the stables to help Harry with the horse.  Now the camp was tidy, the horse and equipment were ready and she had time to spare.  For once she would not have to hurry to the lists for fear of being late.  It was a good feeling to look around and see her 'family' hard at word for a common cause.  Even Annika insisted upon helping with the preparations and watched Harry carefully to learn the names and uses for every piece of equipment B'Elanna wore or used.  </p>
<p>Tom and Kate appeared to have made their peace with B'Elanna's secret and were relaxing into the atmosphere of the tournament grounds.  All in all it was quite a happy group that made their way to the staging area to wait for B'Elanna's first match of the day.  When they reached the edge of the staging grounds they stopped while Annika said goodbye to B'Elanna before leaving with Kate to take their seats in the viewing stands.</p>
<p>The young lovers were suddenly shy as they turned to one another, and it was Annika who managed to speak first.  She took the scarf from around her neck and tied it around B'Elanna's arm.</p>
<p>"I once gave this favour to Lord Beyla that he might joust in my name, but today I give this to you B'Elanna Torrance so that you might know that I favour you above all others in my heart.  Know that I am always with you and that you are always in my heart."</p>
<p>"I never thought I would hear such words spoken in my own name Lady Annika, and I cannot tell you what it means to me to hear them now from you.  From the bottom of my heart I thank you and tell you that I love you always?I will always be your champion Annika?I take my strength from your love and so I know I will be victorious."</p>
<p>With that she placed a kiss on the other woman's lips and watched as her love made her way toward the viewing stands.</p>
<p>"You better pay attention to the ring and forget about the woman or we'll all be in the poor house," Harry joked as he saw the look of love on his friend's face.</p>
<p>"What? Oh, I'm ready Harry bring them on.  She loves me?nothing can stop us now!" B'Elanna grinned widely and grabbed him around the shoulders, forcing his head down as she ruffled his hair.</p>
<p>Harry smiled at his friend's exuberance glad to see a carefree and happy look replace the frown of concentration and responsibility he was used to seeing on B'Elanna's countenance.  Love, it would appear, seemed to agree with her.</p>
<p>Love truly did seem to agree with B'Elanna and she tore through the lists with exuberance and skill.  She was once again victorious and three days hence was again tournament champion.  She spent her days fighting and her evenings with her new extended family.  They were growing ever closer but they all knew that something would soon have to be done about enlarging their living quarters.  Annika and Kate continued to share B'Elanna's part of the tent while B'Elanna, Harry and Tom bunked together on the other side of the curtain.  Harry had gone into town one day and made inquiries about finding another tent suitable for their purposes, but he had no luck.  So they were forced to continue living in close quarters and hoping for better luck in the next town.</p>
<p>In all honesty both B'Elanna and Annika were a little relieved not to have the opportunity to share a bed at this point.  They knew they loved one another and both were anxious to take the next step in their relationship, but neither of them had any experience in these matters and were both feeling rather shy and inadequate at the thought of a closer intimacy.  B'Elanna was also determined to 'do the right thing' in terms of her relationship and she had an idea lurking in the back of her mind that might make them both feel better about things if she could pull it off.  </p>
<p>In mapping out the last of the tournaments and the routes and figuring out the time they would need to reach them B'Elanna smiled as she realized that if they skipped one minor outlying tournament they would have time just before the tournament in London to carry out her plan.  She spoke to Harry and asked that he spend a few days travelling on his own to make the bulk of the arrangements.  She was unwilling to tell Annika of her plans until she was certain they were possible.  Only then would she gather up all of her courage and approach her Lady to ask the question she had in mind.</p>
<p>She put all of this out of her mind however as Annika and Kate came into the common area of the tent carrying several parcels.  They had spent the afternoon after the presentation ceremonies in town with Tom as an escort while B'Elanna cleaned and packed up the equipment for the next day's travel.  Annika appeared to be vibrating with excitement as they came into the shelter.</p>
<p>"What is it love?" B'Elanna asked as she came forward to take the packages from Annika's arms.  "You seem rather elated."</p>
<p>"I?" she hesitated shyly, "I bought you something when I was at the marketplace this afternoon?it is a gift, for you."</p>
<p>B'Elanna smiled at her love's obvious enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Well, I can't wait to see what it is."</p>
<p>Annika handed her one of the parcels and B'Elanna ripped it open with exuberance.  This was the first real gift that she had ever received, and that it should have come from Annika made it all the more special.  The gift was a suit of clothing consisting of shirt, tunic and stockings. The fabric was a deep purple colour and the material was of obvious quality and workmanship.  B'Elanna had little interest in clothes but she was touched that Annika should have thought of her and she expressed her thanks with honest appreciation.</p>
<p>"I thought you could wear it tonight to the ball; I have a dress that will complement the colour and I thought that since this is the first time we will be attending together that it might be nice?"</p>
<p>Her voice trailed off as she spoke; she was suddenly embarrassed at her girlish display and the frivolous nature of her gift.  Surely B'Elanna would not care for such matters.  She cast her eyes down at the ground and so could not see B'Elanna's reaction until the older woman came forward and gently raised her face up to meet her gaze.  She was surprised to see unshed tears shining in B'Elanna's eyes.</p>
<p>"My Lady Annika, this is a most thoughtful gift, and I am most honoured to receive it from you.  The fact that we are to be together tonight is most important to me and I am pleased that you sought to mark the occasion in this fashion.  Thank you my love?from the bottom of my heart."</p>
<p>She folded the beautiful lady into her arms and held her tight for several moments until they were both more firmly in control of their emotions.  Kissing her gently on the lips B'Elanna teased,</p>
<p>"Perhaps I should try it on in case it doesn't fit, or the colour doesn't suit me once I've put it on."</p>
<p>"I am certain you will be pleased my Lord.  I was always very good at purchasing clothing for my father, and the size was always suitable for him."</p>
<p>Seeing the look of sadness that came over Annika's eyes at the mention of her father, B'Elanna hastened to have Kate help her into her new outfit, which indeed fit perfectly.  She made a great show of modeling it for her love, exclaiming again and again how much she loved the outfit.</p>
<p>Annika finally noticed that Harry was nowhere to be seen and she was intrigued when B'Elanna was vague as to where the young man had gone?only saying that he was away on business for several days.  Annika tried her best to get B'Elanna to reveal the nature of the business Harry was taking care of but to no avail.  She wasn't certain that she liked the feeling of secrets between them, but she reminded herself of how much she loved and trusted B'Elanna and finally she let it go?trusting that B'Elanna would reveal her secret when she was ready.</p>
<p>When they separated to begin their preparations for the evening banquet B'Elanna dressed quickly and carefully, wanting everything to be perfect for this evening.  She sat back after she had pulled on her shoes and reflected for a moment on everything that had happened over the past few days.  'What do you do when you have everything you could possibly want in this world,' she wondered to herself.  'Well, almost everything.'  It was hard for her to believe that in less than one year she had completely transformed her life from a that of an angry and directionless girl into that of a Lord who had traveled to France, spoke two languages and could read, write, joust, fight and had won the heart of the woman she loved.  She smiled to herself as she got up to meet Annika, still not entirely believing that the beautiful young woman returned her love regardless of her situation.</p>
<p>When she entered the other half of the tent, after ascertaining that it was safe to do so, she caught her breath at the sight that greeted her eyes.  Annika was a vision in a long, flowing dress that emphasized her slender waist and ample bosom.  It was a softer colour than B'Elanna's tunic and was trimmed with the same dark purple as the outfit Annika had purchased for her.  They made a stunning couple as they stood side by side to model their clothes for Tom and Kate.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was feeling more than a bit shy and she could not understand why.  Then it occurred to her that she and Annika were attending the banquet together this evening.  For the first time they would begin and end the evening together, and not rely on stolen moments on the dance floor for their interactions.  B'Elanna felt as if she were seven feet tall when she offered her arm to Annika and led her out of the tent toward the banquet hall.  She enjoyed the looks they received from the people around them as they picked their way through the tents and firepits that made up the tournament grounds.  As they neared the banquet hall they joined a throng of knights and ladies who were also on their way to banquet.  Even in such company the pair turned heads.</p>
<p>The double doors to the banquet hall soared 12 feet overhead and the hall itself was huge, with food-laden tables on three sides of it, framing the dance floor.  The walls were covered with luxurious banners that depicted the family crest of the Lord who was hosting the tournament as well as richly embroidered scenes illustrating glorious moments in the family's past history.  Battle and hunting scenes dominated the banners, and the rich colours of the tapestries gave warmth to the cavernous room.  Fires burned in several fireplaces along the walls and torches flickered in sconces at three-foot intervals around the room.  It was a warm and welcoming scene, and B'Elanna was happy to hear the musicians tuning up their instruments in one corner of the room.  She smiled to herself when she thought of how much she protested against learning to dance in the beginning.  Now she couldn't wait to take to the dance floor with Annika on her arm.</p>
<p>As they walked around the room picking at the sumptuous food they nodded greetings to the people that they knew from past tournaments.  B'Elanna noticed that some of the older knights refused to meet her eye or return her greetings and she was chastened to realize that she had lost face among some of the more traditional elements on the tour by becoming involved with Lord Kotay's intended wife.  The younger men and women however seemed quite willing to accept them as a couple and in fact Lord Beyla's willingness to fight for his lady love had made him even more popular among the younger women in the crowd.  Annika was surprised to feel a prickling of jealousy come over her when the young unmarried women were flirtatious with Lord Beyla.  She found herself holding even more tightly onto B'Elanna's arm as if she could physically restrain her from being attracted to the flirtatious young women.</p>
<p>When the dancing began B'Elanna led Annika out onto the floor and bowed courteously to her as the music began.  As she twisted through the serpentine rows of dancers, changing partners continuously B'Elanna found that more and more she appreciated the rhythm of the dance, and the athletic skills needed to excel at it.  Once again she was struck by how much had changed in this year of her life.  Catching site of Annika as she wound down the line of ladies toward her she was again awed by the beauty and grace of her love.  It was hard to imagine that someone like Annika could have fallen in love with her, and yet the sweet smile that washed over her features when they once again joined hands in the dance was more than enough to convince her of the truth of the matter.</p>
<p>When there was a break in the dancing B'Elanna and Annika made their way over to a group knights that B'Elanna had come to know fairly well over the course of the season.  They stood as a group eating and talking and consuming the sweet mead produced in this region.  B'Elanna joined in the conversation and after a while Annika grew warm from the efforts of dancing.  It was hot in the room and she felt she needed some air.  She excused herself saying that she was just going to step outside for a moment and then made her way from the room.  B'Elanna watched her go, distracted for a moment by the sight of her love's sensual sway as she walked.  She finally turned back to the conversation and it was some time before she realized that Annika had been gone for too long.  Excusing herself she went outside to search for Lady Hansart.</p>
<p>She didn't see Annika when she stepped outside of the hall, and she was gripped with panic as she looked around in the dark for some clue as to where the Lady might have gone.  She heard what might have been a cry on the other side of the building and she hastened to investigate, fear lending wings to her feet.  When she came around the corner she was horrified to see Annika with her back pressed against the wall of the building; she appeared to be struggling with one of the younger knights as he attempted to kiss her against her will.</p>
<p>As she hurried over to the struggling pair she heard the young man exhorting Annika to relax, that he would be as good a lover as Beyla, and better by far than Kotay.  B'Elanna drew her dagger from its scabbard and grabbing the man she pulled him away from Annika, twisting his body to face her she slammed him into the wall and stuck the point of her dagger to his throat.</p>
<p>"What the hell do you think you are doing?" she hissed, her face contorted in anger.</p>
<p>"Lord Beyla, I was simply?I mean, I just thought?"</p>
<p>"You thought what?" she demanded giving him a furious shake.</p>
<p>"I heard that she was Kotay's courtesan?"</p>
<p>"Hold your tongue or I shall cut it out of your mouth.  You are speaking of the woman I love," B'Elanna interrupted in her fury.</p>
<p>"Love?I didn't know Lord Beyla, I swear?I heard from several of Kotay's friends that she was his whore."  The young man was shaking with fear and somehow B'Elanna believed his story.  In fact it didn't surprise her in the least that Kotay's friends would try to salvage his reputation in such a manner.</p>
<p>"Well you can tell them for me that if I hear such a rumour again I'll seek satisfaction from them in the sword ring.  Do you understand what I'm telling you?"  Her voice was low and deadly and the young man was even more afraid now than he had been when Beyla first discovered him and Annika together.</p>
<p>"Yyes?Lord Beyla, I swear?I do understand?I apologize."</p>
<p>B'Elanna reached up and grasped the young man's face in her hand, twisting his head to the left, forcing him to look at Annika.</p>
<p>"Not to me?to the Lady," she ground out, with a deadly emphasis on the word 'lady'"</p>
<p>"Of course Lord Beyla," he stammered.</p>
<p>When B'Elanna finally let him go he dropped to one knee in front of Annika and humbly begged her forgiveness for his words and his actions and he vowed to do all he could to see her name cleared.  When he was finished he glanced up at B'Elanna like a whipped dog, not daring to get back to his feet without permission from her.  At her curt nod he stood up and backed away from the couple still mumbling apologies as he beat his hasty retreat.</p>
<p>The young man was forgotten the moment he was out of sight and B'Elanna took Annika in her arms, holding the shaking woman close, and murmuring soft words of love and comfort.</p>
<p>"Are you injured my love?" B'Elanna inquired finally.</p>
<p>"I am all right, but B'Elanna, the things he said to me.  He thought I was a courtesan and that I would sleep with him without a thought for you."</p>
<p>"I know, and I am sorry.  I never thought what our relationship might do to your reputation Lady Hansart.  I fear your good name has been sullied because of me."</p>
<p>"I care not for my reputation.  I love you B'Elanna, all that matters is your opinion of me."</p>
<p>"Well, I care for your reputation my lady, and I intend to see to it that all such misconceptions as these are cleared up.  I have no intention of letting anyone spread such lies about you."</p>
<p>Annika relaxed into B'Elanna's embrace once she realized that the older woman did not hold her responsible for what had just happened.  </p>
<p>"Let us go back to the camp Lord Beyla," she said in a small voice.</p>
<p>"Soon my love.  I think we would be best served to go back into the hall and dance another set together however.  I don't want anyone to get the impression that we are easily shaken."</p>
<p>"As you wish my lord," Annika acquiesced.</p>
<p>When they walked back into the hall arm in arm many heads turned to stare at them and B'Elanna knew she had been wise to return.  Word of the incident outside the hall had spread quickly and people were curious to know how the couple would respond.  B'Elanna gave Annika a lingering kiss before leading her back onto the dance floor.  She could hear the murmur of talk among the gathered nobility, but judging by the smiles and approving looks she saw on many faces Lord Beyla's actions were accepted by the majority.  It was obvious to the crowd that Lady Hansart was very important to Lord Beyla, and if he had indeed fought his duel with Kotay for love then under the tenets of the chivalric code they were willing to accept the relationship on those terms. </p>
<p>When the dance was over Annika and B'Elanna left the room arm in arm.  Annika was surprised by the fact that once she had calmed down from her dreadful experience with the young knight, she was actually glad that they had returned to the banquet hall.  She suspected that had they not returned right away, she never would have been able to set foot inside one again.  As hard as it had been to go back into that room and face the looks the people gave her, being on B'Elanna's arm had made it possible.  As long as they loved one another she was certain that together they could face anything.</p>
<p>She looked sideways at the handsome face of the woman she loved, and stopping, she faced B'Elanna, saying quietly,</p>
<p>"Take me home my love."</p>
