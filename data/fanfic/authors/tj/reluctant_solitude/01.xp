	<chapter title="Part 1">
		<p>Seven of Nine was slowly going insane.  Since the crew had been put into stasis in order to protect them from the nebula's radiation she had been almost completely alone. She had struggled with hearing only her own voice in her mind since her separation from the collective, but this was far worse.  </p>

		<p>Much as she had struggled with integration into Voyager's crew she found that what she had once deemed inefficient and annoying was now essential.  She couldn't stand to be alone with her thoughts for this long-she needed the distraction and companionship of her crewmates to thrive.  She was dismayed at that thought, but nevertheless with each day that passed she knew it to be more and more true.</p>

		<p>The doctor had started to get on her nerves after only a few days.  Where once she found him helpful and even charming, now she found him cloying and annoying.  The feeling seemed to be mutual and had his program not begun to degrade requiring that he be taken offline until they cleared the nebula, they would have continued to avoid one another wherever possible.  The corridors of the ship seemed to mock her as moved from place to place carrying out her self-imposed routine.  She had thought that the logic and order of a work schedule would help alleviate the stress of solitude, but now she wondered if it wasn't only making it worse.</p>

		<p>When she heard the hail from the alien ship she had thought her salvation was at hand.  She had never thought that she would be excited at the prospect of making first contact with an alien species, but she had been thrilled when the stranger had made his request for parts and assistance.  It meant that their contact would provide a distraction for a more prolonged period of time.  How quickly it had turned into a nightmare.  The alien had begun terrorizing her almost immediately and the worst part was that she still didn't know how much of the encounter had been real, and how much had been the product of her own delusions.  She began to worry that she would be unable to maintain her sanity until Voyager cleared the nebula.  She MUST persevere, the crew, her new collective, were counting on her.</p>

		<p>She felt the person she was slipping away.  She hadn't really taken the time to appreciate what it meant to be an individual--a person--and now it appeared to be too late.  She clenched her hands into fists so tight that the palm of her fully human hand began to bleed from the pressure.  She needed to concentrate!  She needed to remain focussed on the task at hand or Voyager and its crew would perish.  She needed to maintain her humanity but she had no idea how to do so in the face of her steadily increasing psychosis.</p>

		<p>"I am Seven of Nine Tertiary Adjunct to Unimatrix Zero One," she repeated...her voice growing louder as she desperately tried to remind herself of who and what she was.  "No!  I am Seven of Nine, Astrometrics officer of the Federation Starship Voyager.  I am Seven...I am not One, not alone...I am Seven."</p>

		<p>Despite her best efforts her sanity, her ability to function, continued to slip away.  The harder she tried to hold on, the worse it was.  Then the crew began to appear around her.  Not her friends and acquaintances as she knew them, but rather angry, jeering visions of radiation burned crewmates who blamed and ridiculed her as she worked to repair the ship's failing systems.  They said the most hurtful things to her-things she had only ever said to herself in her darkest moments.  Her self-loathing and her deepest insecurities were feeding off the words and images of the people she had come to care about.</p>

		<p>"Shut up!" she yelled, spinning around to face her tormentors.</p>

		<p>They were all there: the captain, Chakotay, Paris and Kim, even Tuvok was taunting her with looks and words.  At first she thought Lieutenant Torres was absent, but upon closer inspection she saw the half-Klingon standing at the back of the bridge, half in shadow.  Her face was marred by the radiation just like the rest of the crew.  She stood, hipsprung with her arms crossed, a familiar half-smile on her lips.  At first glance Seven was certain the smile was a derisive one, but when she looked more closely the smile appeared friendly, almost encouraging.  The rest of the crew continued to mock her while B'Elanna stood silently-observing.  Just when Seven reached her breaking point, unable to stabilize the warp core containment field and reinitialize the engines, unable to block the sounds of her 'friends' voices, B'Elanna suddenly spoke.</p>

		<p>"You can do it Seven-just concentrate."</p>

		<p>Seven closed her eyes tightly, then reopened them slowly.  The room was empty; there was nobody there.  She returned to her task and to her relief after a further 30 minutes of work the field was stabilized and the core came back on line.  She made the course corrections and set the ship back on its path to the edge of the nebula.</p>

		<p>She breathed a sigh of relief and began to complete her self-imposed rounds.  Midway through she could no longer stop herself from deviating from her carefully planned route.  She found herself in the cargo bay where all of the stasis tubes were located.  She made her way to Lt. Torres' stasis tube.  She gazed down into the peaceful face of the Chief Engineer.  In repose, she seemed much younger than the force of nature she had come to know as B'Elanna Torres.  She touched her hand to the Plexan casing of the tube, wishing it were the engineer's face she was touching, but knowing that if she were awake the fiery Klingon would not welcome the touch of a drone.  She laid her cheek on the cool surface, her mind clear and calm at last.  She smiled slightly at the sight of B'Elanna's stuffed Targ tucking out of sight down by her hands.  Seven began to appreciate that beneath B'Elanna's tough exterior she was as full of fears and doubts as everyone else trapped here in the Delta quadrant.</p>

		<p>"Thank you B'Elanna," she whispered.</p>

		<p>Sighing, Seven stood upright and forced herself to leave the cargo bay and continue on her rounds.  She heard a sound and turned her head to find B'Elanna keeping pace with her as she walked.  The engineer stayed with her as she worked, never speaking, but always offering a comforting presence to Seven in her agitated state.  The last thing that Seven saw before her regeneration cycle began was the figure of B'Elanna Torres settling down on the dais, to watch over her as she slept.</p>

		<p>From that day on Seven spent at least a portion of everyday in the cargo bay 'talking' to B'Elanna.  She told her of her difficulties in keeping the engines running, and of her fears that she would not be able to keep control of her mind long enough to get Voyager clear of the nebula.  She took comfort in her closeness to the beautiful engineer and longed wistfully for the impossible.  That when the crew was again awake that somehow she and B'Elanna would become close.  She knew the engineer was involved with Tom Paris, but she had often observed that the couple was ill suited for one another.  </p>

		<p>"You deserve someone stronger and more honourable, someone who can love you with their entire being the way you should be loved, not someone who will make you feel that you are second in his affections to the holodeck."  She paused for a long moment as she gazed at the face of the one she had come to think of as her saviour.  "I would be that person."</p>

		<p>She straightened up and prepared for her rounds.  Her mind had been much calmer the last few days, and the edge of the nebula was close, but Voyager's systems continued to break down with increasing regularity.  She was worried that all of the patches and bypasses she had created would not be enough to carry the starship through to the other side.  If too many more systems and gel packs malfunctioned there would be nothing left to bypass with.  However, she knew she had to keep trying.  She spent the day rerouting power from every non-essential system left running, and still it might not be enough.  The engines were constantly on the edge of stalling out, and her crewmates had returned to taunt her with her imminent failure.  She had to make a decision, the crew or herself.  She deactivated the life support to the stasis tubes and the engines came back on line-the edge of the nebula was in sight.  The crewmembers appeared to her again tormenting her, accusing her of being responsible for their deaths, of sacrificing them to save her own life, the figure of B'Elanna appeared and walked through the darkened room toward her.</p>

		<p>"I trust you Seven-with my life."</p>

		<p>Seven made the only possible decision upon hearing the engineer's words.  She deactivated the life support on the ship and restored power to the stasis tubes.  The doctor would come on line the second they cleared the nebula and he would be able to revive the crew.  She would perish, but it was worth it if B'Elanna would live.  As she sank into unconsciousness she was still able to hear the torments of the Captain and Chakotay as they watched her die. </p>

		<p>She awoke in sick bay several hours later.  Her plan had been successful and the crew had come through the ordeal unscathed, unknowing of what she had been through, what she had been prepared to do on their behalf.  None of that mattered to her now that she knew her collective was safe.  Once she was released from sick bay she made her way back to Cargo Bay 2 for an extended period of regeneration.  She looked around the room, hoping illogically that B'Elanna would appear and again watch over her while she rested, but of course the Klingon never appeared.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 2">
		<p>When Seven awoke from her regeneration cycle she found herself alone, again.  As illogical as it was, she missed the illusion of the Chief Engineer that had been her constant companion during her ordeal in the nebula.  She was saddened to realize that even the simple pleasure of visiting B'Elanna's stasis tube was now denied her-she could no longer gaze unrestricted at the beautiful face of the Klingon hybrid.  She would miss her one-sided conversations with the fiery beauty as she had found them a valuable asset in accessing and evaluating her thoughts and emotions.  Now, more than ever, she was alone.</p>

		<p>Sighing at the illogical paths her thoughts were taking, she left her alcove.  The loneliness was overwhelming; she needed the company of her peers.  It was not in her nature to 'need' and she found the feeling disconcerting.  Even though it was her habit to partake of her nutritional supplement as quickly as possible and report to Astrometrics early for her duty shift, this morning she decided to eat breakfast with her fellow crewmates to try to alleviate the sense of separateness that was plaguing her.</p>

		<p>When she entered the messhall she did not know whether to be delighted or dismayed at the sight of B'Elanna having a meal with Tom and Harry.  She retrieved her food and then stood awkwardly near them, unsure of how to proceed.  To her surprise it was B'Elanna who came to her rescue.  The normally taciturn engineer actually invited her to sit at their table, joked with her about the quality of the food, and went so far as to say that they 'owed her one' for bringing them through the nebula safely.  It was more than Seven could have hoped for.  She took a seat beside B'Elanna and immediately dropped her eating utensil when her leg inadvertently brushed against B'Elanna's.  If any of them noticed they were too polite to draw attention to it and soon she found herself actually making conversation with the small group.  She felt completely awkward and exposed, certain that B'Elanna could read her thoughts and was aware of how Seven felt about her.  Every moment was agony and bliss at the same time.  She wanted to flee the room, at the same time as she never wanted to leave the engineer's side.  She was in heaven and in hell.  Through it all she mechanically ate, nodding in what she hoped were appropriate points in the conversation, and simply hoping that she could get through this situation without inviting the ire of the Klingon beauty sitting at her side.</p>

		<p>When the meal was over, the group began discussing their plans for the evening.  They were planning to meet for an evening of drinks and pool in Sandrine's.  Images of B'Elanna kissing Tom while they socialized with their friends rose unbidden in Seven's mind to torment her.  So absorbed was she in her thoughts that she barely heard Harry address his question to her until he asked it for the second time.</p>

		<p>"Would you like to come with us Seven?"</p>

		<p>She hesitated, unsure of whether or not she could stand to spend so much time in the company of B'Elanna knowing that the beautiful woman was with Tom.  In the end it was B'Elanna who made the decision for her.</p>

		<p>"Come on Seven, you never know you might actually have fun."  The light teasing tone of her voice took the sting out of the words for Seven, and almost involuntarily she found herself nodding her acquiescence.</p>

		<p>"Great," Harry said, "we'll meet you there at 1900hrs."</p>

		<p>Seven rose on unsteady legs and nodded to the small group of friends.</p>

		<p>"Lieutenants, ensign, thank you for your company and your kind invitation."  She barely breathed until she heard the messhall doors swish shut behind her.</p>

		<p>"That was weird," Tom laughed at Seven's overly formal departure.</p>

		<p>"Give her a break Tom, at least she trying," B'Elanna spoke up.</p>

		<p>"Since when do you defend the Ice Princess?"  Tom's surprise was evident by the look of shock on his face at hearing B'Elanna defend her adversary.</p>

		<p>"Since I heard she nearly died getting us through that nebula."</p>

		<p>"I heard she nearly killed us all by shutting off power to the stasis tubes," Tom retorted.</p>

		<p>"For a few minutes just to get the engines restarted, then she powered the tubes back up and shut off life support to keep Voyager moving.  She had no way of knowing we'd get out in time to save her from asphyxiation.  Anyone who would do that deserves a second chance in my opinion." </p>

		<p>"I'll remind you of that when you're threatening to blow her out an airlock for interfering with engineering...probably later this afternoon," Tom laughed.</p>

		<p>"Shut up Paris," B'Elanna growled.</p>

		<p>She was angry with Tom for being such a child, but even more angry with him for probably being right. She had been impressed with Seven's actions, but Kahless knew the former drone got on her nerves.  She vowed to try to be more patient with the stiff young woman and hoped that, to that end, some of the meditation techniques she learned from Tuvok might come in handy.  </p>

		<p>Seven entered Sandrine's several minutes after Tom, Harry and B'Elanna arrived.  The truth was that she been on time, but had stood outside of the holodeck doors for several minutes debating with herself over the wisdom of entering the room.  A part of her wanted to leave and return to the cargo bay where she would be safe, if alone.  But another part of her wanted to enter the holodeck and be near B'Elanna, no matter what it cost her personally.  In the end, the fact that she had given her word that she would appear was the deciding factor and she took a deep breath before striding into the room.</p>

		<p>As soon as the door opened and Seven of Nine appeared, B'Elanna felt a flash of annoyance.  The coldly superiour look on Seven's face never failed to irritate her.  She watched as the Astrometrics officer strode through the bar toward them.  When Seven reached their table she hesitated, uncertain of her welcome and unsure of what to do with herself now that she had arrived.  As B'Elanna watched the look of uncertainty flit briefly across Seven's haughty features she felt her anger fade.  'It's just a front,' she thought to herself as she saw Seven assume her customary stance beside their table.</p>

		<p>"Have a seat Seven," B'Elanna felt herself smiling up at Seven, amazed to see a small smile grace the former drone's features for a second before she once again became her inscrutable self.</p>

		<p>Tom jumped up and came back with a tray of drinks and soon he and Harry were entertaining the group with stories from their last away mission.  Seven was seated across from B'Elanna and she passed the time that Tom spent bragging about his piloting skills observing the Klingon hybrid surreptitiously.  B'Elanna did not appear to be listening closely to Tom's story at all, in fact her eyes were unfocussed and Seven would have bet that she was working through some problem in engineering the entire time that she was smiling and nodding at the flight controller's antics.  Tom didn't seem to notice in the least that half his audience was paying him no mind and he and Harry continued trading barbs and laughing until it was their turn claim the pool table.</p>

		<p>"So, whaddaya say...girls against the guys," Tom taunted as she racked up the balls.  He was enjoying paying B'Elanna back for her defense of the Borg earlier.  He fully expected her to make an excuse to not have to partner with Seven, and in fact it had been on the tip of her tongue to do just that when she saw the look in Tom's eyes.</p>

		<p>"If you think you can handle us flyboy," she replied.</p>

		<p>Seven felt as if she was getting into a situation that was beyond her social skills, so as much as she wished to play with B'Elanna she felt compelled to speak up.</p>

		<p>"I have never played this game before, perhaps it would be better if Lieutenant Torres had a more experienced partner."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna could clearly see the discomfort on Seven's face and she hastened to reassure her.</p>

		<p>"Don't worry Seven, with your hand-eye coordination you'll catch on in no time," she said with a wink.</p>

		<p>Seven thought that her heart would never beat again when she saw the beautiful engineer wink at her.  Still, she wanted to be certain that B'Elanna knew what she was getting into.</p>

		<p>"If you are certain Lieutenant."</p>

		<p>"I'm certain Seven, you'll do fine," she said as she handed Seven a cue.</p>

		<p>When B'Elanna's fingers brushed hers as she took the cue from the engineer's hands, once again Seven lost all sense of time and space.  She nearly dropped the stick from her nerveless fingers and felt her face heat up with embarrassment as she saw Tom laughing, presumably at her clumsiness.  She watched carefully as the helmsman broke the triangle of balls, and then observed every nuance as both B'Elanna and Harry lined up the balls and took their shots.  She listened carefully as B'Elanna explained the game to her, gritting her teeth to maintain her concentration at she felt the Klingon's hands on her hips, and then her shoulders as she showed her how to take aim and make her shot.  Her heart was pounding but she forced herself to focus and to her delight she sank the ball she was aiming at with a quick flick of her arm, her heart fell however when she saw the white ball follow the other one down into the pocket.</p>

		<p>"I am sorry Lieutenant," she foolishly felt as if she might cry at the sound of Tom and Harry gloating good-naturedly over her mistake.  </p>

		<p>"Don't worry about it Seven, you're doing great."  For an instant Seven felt as if she were back in the nebula and this was her illusion of B'Elanna being so kind and compassionate.  </p>

		<p>Despite her best effort Tom and Harry won the first game by several balls.  Tom suggested switching partners and to Seven's surprise B'Elanna refused.</p>

		<p>"Oh no you don't Paris.  You challenged us and now you're just going to have to take your medicine.  Right Seven?"</p>

		<p>"Correct."  Seven was uncertain as to how exactly to participate in this kind of banter so she followed B'Elanna's lead, happy that the engineer wished to keep playing with her despite their defeat.</p>

		<p>The second game wasn't even close as B'Elanna practically ran the table before Tom or Harry could get in a shot.  So it came down to a third and deciding game.  B'Elanna missed her first shot and Harry sank several in a row.  They played quite evenly, with Seven managing to sink several balls in a row much to her delight and relief.  In the end it came down to a tie.  Only the black ball remained and it was Seven's shot.  If she missed then Tom would have an opportunity to win the game.  Despite her normally cool Borg exterior Seven was nervous and to her dismay she felt her hands trembling as she lined up the shot.  B'Elanna leaned on the table beside her and whispered so that only Seven could hear.</p>

		<p>"You can do it Seven-just concentrate."</p>

		<p>Seven sucked in a quick breath as B'Elanna echoed precisely the words her specter had uttered on the bridge while they were trapped in the nebula.  She closed her eyes for a moment and then concentrating fiercely she lined up the ball and made her shot.  She heard B'Elanna's whoop of elation almost before she saw the ball find a home in the pocket, and to her amazement she felt the fiery engineer pick her up and spin her around.  She was actually in B'Elanna's arms!  When her feet were once again on the ground she graciously accepted the congratulations of both Tom and Harry.</p>

		<p>"Well, hate to cut your gloating time short, but Harry and I have Holodeck 2 reserved for the next couple of hours," Tom informed.</p>

		<p>"What are you talking about Tom.  I thought we agreed that we were spending the evening here, together?" B'Elanna asked with an angry edge to her voice.</p>

		<p>"I know, I know, but the group that had the other holodeck reserved had to cancel at the last minute so we grabbed it.  You CAN come with us you know.  We're gonna run Captain Proton-you could be my secretary if you'd like," he teased wiggling his eyebrows suggestively.  "Of course you and Seven could always stay here and play some more pool if you'd like," he said.</p>

		<p>Once again B'Elanna knew that Tom was rubbing her nose in her defense of Seven, but this time she didn't care.  She was so angry that he always chose his friends and his holoprograms over her that she didn't even care that she was stuck here in Sandrine's with Seven.</p>

		<p>"I'm certain the lieutenant has better things to do with her time.  Thank you all for a lovely evening," Seven replied and prepared to go back to her cargo bay.</p>

		<p>"Hold on Seven, if you want to stay I could use the company," B'Elanna said, staring right into the amused eyes of the pilot.  She knew she was being manipulated by Tom, but the stubborn Klingon in her couldn't let go.</p>

		<p>"I...would like that Lieutenant." Seven replied shyly.</p>

		<p>"I think it's about time you started calling me B'Elanna, don't you?"</p>

		<p>"As you wish...B'Elanna."  In truth Seven always thought of the engineer that way in her mind, but had been reluctant to take such a liberty out loud until now.  She was both terrified and thrilled at the prospect of interacting alone with B'Elanna socially for the first time.</p>

		<p>Tom threw his arm around Harry's shoulders and began explaining in detail the portion of the Captain Proton program they were about to run as they left Sandrine's together.  B'Elanna's knuckles were white where she clutched her pool cue and tried to control her anger.  She was startled when she felt a gentle hand on her shoulder.</p>

		<p>"Are you certain you wish to remain B'Elanna?  It would be understandable if you did not."</p>

		<p>"What...no, I mean yes...I'm sure I want to stay.  The truth is I could use the distraction.  Why don't you rack 'em up."</p>

		<p>Seven moved quickly to set up the balls before B'Elanna changed her mind and left.  She motioned for the engineer to break and the two of them began moving around the table, quietly playing the game.  It was B'Elanna who finally broke the silence.</p>

		<p>"You're being awfully quiet Seven...what's up"</p>

		<p>Seven hesitated before she answered the question.  She was a little afraid of B'Elanna's reaction, but she could not bring herself to be less than honest with her.</p>

		<p>"I am enjoying our interaction, and I do not wish it to end prematurely.  To further that end I am keeping my trap shut."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna choked on the sip of beer she had been taking when Seven answered her question.  Finally she sputtered</p>

		<p>"Keeping your trap shut?"</p>

		<p>"Stardate 51658.2 you told me that if I wanted to live long enough to see the Alpha Quadrant I should just shut my trap and let you think."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna felt the colour rise to her cheeks.</p>

		<p>"I really said that?"</p>

		<p>"I assure you that you did."</p>

		<p>"Kahless I can be a read hardass sometimes.  I'm sorry Seven...it's just sometimes..."</p>

		<p>"I irritate the hell out of you," Seven interrupted.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna barked out a laugh at Seven's comment.  It never occurred to her that Seven could be so self-aware.  She found herself laughing until tears ran down her cheeks, and every time she thought she had it under control she would hear Seven's words again in her head and the laughter would begin again.  </p>

		<p>"Kahless Seven, I can't remember the last time I laughed like that," she said when she finally had control of her voice again.</p>

		<p>"That is truly a pity B'Elanna, you are lovely when you laugh."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was a little taken aback by Seven's comment, but it had been a long time since anyone had called her lovely-she had forgotten how good it felt.</p>

		<p>"Thanks Seven," she said sincerely.</p>

		<p>The rest of the evening passed quickly and an easy camaraderie began to grow between the two women.  They discussed several engineering problems that the crew was working on, and to her surprise B'Elanna found herself having a good time.  She was amazed when Seven told her of her experiences alone in the nebula, and touched to find that it had been Seven's image of her that had allowed the former borg to be able to continue functioning.  Seven left out many of the details of those lonely weeks, but she wanted B'Elanna to know how much she had appreciated the engineer's unwitting assistance during that stressful time.  Even though B'Elanna had had nothing to do with Seven's hallucinations it made her unaccountably proud to think that Seven had drawn strength from her image.  It was with real regret that B'Elanna noticed how late it was getting. </p>

		<p>"I hate to say it Seven, but I really should be getting to bed.  I have an early day tomorrow."</p>

		<p>"Of course B'Elanna, as do I."  Seven hesitated a moment before continuing.  "I had a wonderful time with you tonight.  Thank you."</p>

		<p>"I had a lot of fun Seven.  We should do this again."  B'Elanna felt awkward talking like this with someone she had never particularly gotten along with, but it was the simple truth.</p>

		<p>"I would very much like that," Seven replied, happy to think that B'Elanna wanted to spend more time with her.  "Sleep well B'Elanna."</p>

		<p>"I'll see you tomorrow," B'Elanna said as they parted ways in the corridor.</p>

		<p>For the first time since she had come aboard Voyager Seven no longer felt alone.  She couldn't remember ever feeling quite so happy.  She resolutely refused to think about the fact that later tonight Tom Paris would probably be stopping by B'Elanna's quarters; that was something she would rather forget.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 3">
		<p>Seven awoke from her regeneration cycle and a smile immediately graced her features as her eidetic memory replayed the events of last evening.  The chief engineer's smile, the sound of her laughter, the touch of her hand on Seven's body all flitted through her mind, making her happy.  She decided to take a chance on running into B'Elanna in the mess hall and so she headed out quickly to the turbolift.  To her delight the Klingon hybrid was eating her breakfast when Seven entered the room, but her heart fell when she saw that she was sharing a table with Lieutenant Paris.  She retrieved her nutritional supplement and debated whether or not she should approach their table.  Neither of them looked up or appeared to notice her presence so she decided that she should not intrude.  She took a seat across the room, one with an unimpeded view of B'Elanna.  She watched as the beautiful brunette smiled at one of Tom's jokes and suddenly her meal turned to ashes in her mouth.  The happy mood she had been floating on seemed to drain away like water, and suddenly she felt alone again.  She finished her drink quickly and left for her duty shift. She caught B'Elanna's eye as she moved toward the doors, but she couldn't bring herself to acknowledge the Klingon's look; she just wanted to be far away from the image of the engineer and the flight controller eating together.</p>

		<p>As Seven exited the room Tom looked up and noticed that she had been there.  He couldn't resist a quick poke at B'Elanna.</p>

		<p>"Well, I see your new best friend couldn't wait to get out of here.  I'm surprised she didn't want to have breakfast with you Lanna."</p>

		<p>"Give it a rest Tom.  She's not so bad once you get to know her."</p>

		<p>"Right, that's why she rushed over here to have breakfast with you."</p>

		<p>"Jump to conclusions much Tom?  She could have been in a hurry, or maybe she just didn't want to have breakfast with you."  </p>

		<p>B'Elanna was angry with Tom for his incessant harping on her conflicted relationship with Seven.  She also hated to admit that she was a little hurt that Seven hadn't even said 'hello' this morning, or acknowledged her smile after things had gone so well last night.  She shook her head...it shouldn't matter to her whether Seven said good morning or not, two days ago she would have traded all of her replicator rations if someone could have promised her that the former drone would never speak to her again.  So why did it matter so much all of a sudden?  B'Elanna didn't have time to worry about it; there was work to complete in Engineering.  She rose abruptly and left a smirking Tom Paris to finish his breakfast alone-again.</p>

		<p>Everyone in engineering could tell that the Chief was in a foul mood from the second she strode through the doors to the department.  She was caustic and short with everyone, but it wasn't until she nearly tore Vorik's head off for being unable to complete a simple repair quickly enough that B'Elanna herself realized that there was a problem.  She apologized to an impassive Vorik and went to her office to catch up on her paperwork and spare her coworkers her foul mood.  She had already missed lunch and it was well past the end of her shift when she finally stopped working and allowed herself to examine her mood. To her surprise she realized that she was indeed upset about Seven not even giving her the time of day this morning in the messhall.  She felt a surge of irritation that it seemed to matter so much to her, but still, there was no denying that it did.  Never one to avoid a problem, B'Elanna left her office and made her way up to Astrometrics to confront Seven of Nine.  Even though the Gamma shift was long over B'Elanna wasn't surprised to find the former Borg still working away alone. </p>

		<p>"Hey," she said as she entered Seven's domain.</p>

		<p>The younger woman looked up at B'Elanna's greeting and the smile that spread over her face wiped away the foul mood that had been haunting the engineer all day.  </p>

		<p>"B'Elanna," she replied in her carefully modulated tones.</p>

		<p>"I was...uh..." B'Elanna was suddenly ill at ease.  She had come here for a confrontation and now the mere sight of Seven's genuine smile had taken the wind completely out of her sails.  "Do you want to have dinner? I mean if you haven't already eaten."  The words were out before the Klingon even knew what she was saying.  </p>

		<p>"I would like that very much." Seven's normally impassive face was suffused with colour.  She couldn't believe that B'Elanna was seeking out her company.  It was more than she could have hoped for in her wildest imaginings.  Never in her life had she felt such a mixture of emotions, joy, fear, happiness and trepidation coursed through her body nearly causing her cortical node to malfunction as it worked to keep up with the welter of intense feelings Seven was experiencing.  Without another word Seven shut down her workstation and logged off for the evening.</p>

		<p>When they reached the turbolift B'Elanna ordered it to the messhall, and then realized that she really didn't want Tom to see her having dinner with Seven.  She just didn't want to see the look of amusement on his face when he saw them together, especially after his comments at breakfast.  She told the computer to belay her first command and then ordered the lift to her own deck.  Seven was surprised that B'Elanna was taking her to her personal quarters but the joy she felt at the prospect of having the engineer all to herself quickly washed away all other thoughts.</p>

		<p>As they made their way to her quarters B'Elanna found herself growing more and more confused.  Although she did the emotion 'angry' very well, when it came to the rest of the emotional spectrum she was more childlike than she cared to admit, even to herself.  She had known little joy in her life, had few friendships, was rarely happy and wasn't certain that she really knew what love was despite her relationship with Tom Paris.  So it was that she wasn't able to settle into a feeling state now.  She still felt hurt at Seven's apparent disregard for her this morning.  She felt as though her new friend had rejected her and her offer of friendship out of hand, but the former Drone's behaviour this evening would seem to belie that fact.  B'Elanna was uncomfortable with her confusion and so she lapsed into sullen silence.  When they reached her quarters she motioned Seven inside and began the preparations for dinner without a word.</p>

		<p>Seven stood in the centre of B'Elanna's living room and found that she didn't know what to do with herself.  She wanted to look around the Klingon's well-ordered living space, but she was afraid of invoking the engineer's ire if her interest was mistaken for snooping.  So she merely stood in place and watched as B'Elanna worked.  She could sense that the Klingon-hybrid was becoming increasingly agitated and she was worried that she had unwittingly angered the dark-haired woman.  </p>

		<p>"B'Elanna," she finally mustered up the courage to speak.  "If you would prefer that I go...I will comply," she finished softly.</p>

		<p>"No one's keeping you here Seven.  If you want to go just go."  B'Elanna felt the comfortable blanket of her anger wrapping itself protectively around her as she interpreted Seven's question as a statement of desire.</p>

		<p>"I do not wish to go, but it seems that you are uncomfortable with my presence here and I do not wish to make you angry."  Seven stopped, unsure of how to explain her feelings.</p>

		<p>The two women stood facing one another, their confusion and hurt building a wall between them.  Finally it was B'Elanna who bridged the gap.</p>

		<p>"Why didn't you say hello to me this morning in the mess hall?"</p>

		<p>Whatever Seven had been expecting it hadn't been this.</p>

		<p>"I...you were having breakfast with Lieutenant Paris.  I did not think you would welcome my intrusion.  I apologize if I hurt your feelings or offended in any way.  It was not my intention to do so."</p>

		<p>Now it was B'Elanna's turn to be surprised.  She was unable to formulate a reply and simply stood staring at the concerned face of Seven of Nine.  Seven took the engineer's silent look to be one of anger or disbelief and so she hung her head and walked toward the doors of the cabin.  When the sensors activated and the doors slid open she paused.</p>

		<p>"You should know B'Elanna that I would never do anything to intentionally hurt you."  She was about to leave when the voice of the Klingon stopped her in her tracks.</p>

		<p>"Wait!"  </p>

		<p>Seven's heartfelt words made B'Elanna feel a sharp pang of remorse.  She wasn't used to dealing with other people's emotions like this, and Seven's inexperience was exacerbating their communication difficulty.  B'Elanna realized it was up to her to clarify the situation before she lost someone she was coming to consider a friend.</p>

		<p>"Look Seven...I'm sorry I'm being so prickly with you today.  The truth is I'm feeling a little out of my depth here.  I...I've never really done this kind of thing before.  I guess after last night I thought we were becoming friends, and so this morning I got my feelings hurt when you didn't even acknowledge my existance..."</p>

		<p>"So you decided to push me away before you were further hurt by my perceived rejection of your friendship," Seven interrupted.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was taken aback by Seven's razor sharp incite, and frankly she didn't like the image it evoked of her as a frightened child, but she had to admit that the former drone was correct.</p>

		<p>"Yeah...something like that," she muttered.  "Something exactly like that.  Seven I'm sorry."</p>

		<p>"There is no need for you to apologize.  I should have said something to you this morning when I realized you had seen me.  I simply didn't want to interrupt your time with Mr. Paris."</p>

		<p>"My friends are always welcome at my table," B'Elanna declared.  </p>

		<p>She was rewarded for her words with another of Seven's brilliant smiles.  She found herself breaking into an answering grin.</p>

		<p>"Alright, enough of this sentimental nonsense, I'm starving."  B'Elanna's voice was gruff but Seven could tell by the laughter in her eyes that she was only teasing.</p>

		<p>The mood between the two of them was much more relaxed as B'Elanna returned to the kitchen and continued with her dinner preparations.  Seven felt sufficiently at ease to wander around the Klingon's quarters and observe the sparse decorations that B'Elanna had placed in her rooms.  When they finally sat down to eat it was as if their misunderstanding had never occurred and B'Elanna found herself laughing at Seven's deadpan imitations of various crewmembers.  She couldn't remember when she had felt so relaxed or had so much fun.  Later that night she would remember this observation with a tinge of sadness when she realized that Tom seldom made her laugh like that, or spent so much uninterrupted time alone with her outside of the holodeck.</p>

	<chapter title="Part 4">
		<p>The relationship between the two women seemed to settle down after their dinner together and they seemed to relax into a productive working relationship.  They fell into a pattern of sharing at least one meal per day together, but despite that fact they never again discussed their feelings or attempted to clarify the nature of their relationship-the dinners, as enjoyable as they were, took the form of a working dinner.  They discussed their jobs and dreamed up projects that they could work on together to improve the functioning of many of Voyager's systems.  They had achieved a measure of comfort in working together, but they only seemed able to socialize alone together when the evening was structured around work.  B'Elanna was uncomfortable with the fact that she had been so open about her feelings with the former drone.  She was unused to discussing emotions and uncomfortable with how vulnerable she felt now that she had admitted fearing rejection by Seven.  Seven for her part was not comfortable in keeping the truth about her feelings from B'Elanna and was afraid that if their conversation were to take a more personal turn she would be forced to lie to her new friend, and that was unacceptable to her.  But still, they both enjoyed the time they spent together, even if sometimes it felt a bit devoid of feeling.</p>

		<p>Their current collaboration involved a method of enriching the dilithium mixture ratio in order to increase the ability of the warp core to sustain higher warp speeds for longer periods of time.  The project involved extensive modifications to both the injectors and the warp core itself.  As usual both Seven and B'Elanna had very firm ideas as to how best to carry out the modifications, and after several hours of discussion they still had not come to an agreement as to how they should proceed.  Seven, in her usual manner, had decided that her method was the proper one and took it upon herself to begin modifications without further consultations with the Chief engineer.  She had been working steadily for over an hour when her concentration was interrupted by the arrival of an extremely agitated half-Klingon engineer.</p>

		<p>"Seven!  What the hell do you think you're doing?"  Seven was startled by the sound of B'Elanna's angry voice.  The flash of guilt she felt at having proceeded without B'Elanna's permission was extinguished when she bumped her head sharply on the railing surrounding the warp core and was replaced by anger.</p>

		<p>"I am attempting to carry out the modifications to the warp core in the most efficient manner possible."  B'Elanna was infuriated with the former drone for usurping her authority and going behind her back to work on the core.</p>

		<p>"We still haven't agreed on the best method of proceeding..."</p>

		<p>"No, WE have not because you are incapable of admitting that my way is superiour.  I am tired of waiting and so I have decided to simply proceed in the best interests of the ship." Seven interrupted.</p>

		<p>"Dammit Seven, you just can't come into my engine room and start tearing apart the core without my permission.  You are really starting to piss me off here."</p>

		<p>"Good!"</p>

		<p>"Good?"</p>

		<p>"Yes...I am happy that you are pissed off as that will give you some appreciation for how I am feeling in this moment."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was a little shocked to hear such language coming out of Seven's mouth, and the truth was she almost laughed out loud, but she was still too angry at what she saw as Seven's betrayal to relent.</p>

		<p>"You're mad at me?"</p>

		<p>"Yes!"</p>

		<p>"You can't be mad at me!"</p>

		<p>"Why not?"</p>

		<p>"Because...I was mad at you first!"  B'Elanna knew she was being childish, but she was still too angry to care.</p>

		<p>"I wasn't aware that we were taking turns," Seven couldn't stop a smirk from playing around the edges of her mouth.</p>

		<p>Now B'Elanna couldn't stop the smile that spread over her face.  She was fighting back laughter as she spoke.</p>

		<p>"How about I only get mad at you on days of the week with vowels in their names," B'Elanna joked.</p>

		<p>"And I will only get angry at you on Stardates that contain prime numbers."  They were both laughing now, and B'Elanna had to lean on the main console to keep herself upright.  There were tears running down her cheeks as she fought herself back under control.</p>

		<p>Her smile faded as she turned back to the warp core and caught sight of the half-dismantled machinery.</p>

		<p>"Seven, I really think that if we realign the magnetic constrictors the way I outlined in my plan we'll have a better conversion rate of anti-matter over the long run."</p>

		<p>Seven knew that B'Elanna's plan was at least as efficient as her own.  She was unwilling to risk another argument with her friend by disagreeing with her again, so she merely shrugged her shoulders as she spoke.</p>

		<p>"Perhaps you are right.  I believe we should proceed according to your plan."</p>

		<p>"Damn right we should," B'Elanna growled.  "My way is better.  Besides, don't ever forget that this is MY engine room."</p>

		<p>"You really are a child Lieutenant Torres," Seven muttered.</p>

		<p>"Yeah, but that's why you love me."  Seven froze at B'Elanna's words.  A blush crept over her cheeks-she was terrified that the Chief had found out about her true feelings.  It was only when she realized that B'Elanna was still teasing that she relaxed and began to undo some of her modifications.  They continued to tease back and forth while they worked, both of them happy to have weathered their first fight since forging a friendship.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The improvement of the warp core succeeded beyond their expectations and they managed to complete the project with a minimum of disagreement between them-a downright miracle according to several junior members of the engineering staff.  They continued to spend a large portion of their free time together, and B'Elanna found herself wondering why she no longer got so angry at Tom when he ran off to play with Harry in the holodeck, or canceled their plans together in order to spend time on his latest obsession.  One such evening she returned to her quarters after having spent the evening with Seven, deep in discussions about improving sensor accuracy; she suddenly realized that it had been over a week since she had spent any real time with Tom.  In the past it would have infuriated her to feel that she was being cast aside by the helmsman, but tonight she felt almost nothing, certainly not anger, when she thought of the amount of time they had spent apart.  It was troubling to her that she felt this way and despite the fact that something was nagging at the back of her mind about the nature and quality of their relationship she determined that she should be the one to do something about how little time they had spent together recently.  She resolved to seek Tom out for dinner the very next day.  After all they were in a relationship and honour demanded that she do her best to make it work.  She fell asleep firm in her resolve despite the niggling feeling that she was overlooking something important.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>The next day Seven of Nine was working in Astrometrics when Tom Paris, Chakotay and Neelix came to see her.  Voyager had found what amounted to an Interstellar junk dealer and they wished to use the ships' sensors to take a closer look at what was on offer.  She helped them scan the fields of scrap in order to make a list of things they wished to obtain from the rather seedy looking trader.  They were completing the scans when the helmsman let out a low whistle at a small shuttlecraft the sensors had picked up.</p>

		<p>"I think I'm in love," he said in a tone of reverential awe.</p>

		<p>Seven gave him a rather scathing look, which he missed-his entire attention being consumed by the small ship.</p>

		<p>"You are in a relationship with Lieutenant Torres...I should think you would KNOW what it is to be in love," she couldn't stop herself from saying.</p>

		<p>Paris ignored her remark completely, if he heard it at all. He was still scanning the ship and attempting to convince Chakotay that Voyager 'needed' to obtain it at any cost.  Seven found Chakotay to be unusually levelheaded for a human and so she was surprised at how quickly he gave in to Tom's enthusiasm for the ship.  She shook her head and felt a sense of sadness on behalf of her friend as she realized that B'Elanna was in for another period of time in which she would be forced to take a back seat to yet another in Tom Paris' seemingly endless line of pet projects and hobbies.  She felt a fleeting sense of happiness knowing that B'Elanna would be free to spend a great amount of uninterrupted time with her, but she forced herself to push that thought aside.  She truly loved B'Elanna, and, as such, she wanted to put her friend's happiness first above all else.  It was not easy, but Seven was used to that.</p>

		<p>She stood by and watched while B'Elanna tried to take an interest in the ship that Tom had named Alice, and she provided a sympathetic ear when the Klingon hybrid again and again was hurt by Tom's disregard for her feelings.  When the ship attempted to harm B'Elanna in an attempt to have Tom all to itself Seven was ready to do physical damage to the helmsman in her anger at him for putting B'Elanna in danger.  It was only her knowledge that B'Elanna would not be pleased if she did that stayed her hand against the childish flight controller.  When Alice and Tom left Voyager Seven was inclined to let them go, but once again her feelings for B'Elanna dictated her actions and she did everything she could to track the ship and bring the wayward pilot back into Voyager's fold.</p>

		<p>After the incident with Alice, Tom seemed to mend his ways.  He was much more attentive to B'Elanna, and attempted to spend a great deal more time with her.  This left Seven very much on her own, and it bothered her.  She missed her interactions with the Chief Engineer, and longed to spend more time with her, but at the same time she berated herself for her selfishness, B'Elanna appeared to be happy and Seven was determined to support her, no matter the personal cost.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was indeed happy that Tom was spending more time with her...at first.  But after an endless round of dates in Sandrine's, and games on the holodeck she began to feel that something was missing.  Exactly what it was eluded her for a few days...but after another evening spent listening to Tom talk about his latest holodeck program she realized that what she was missing was the companionship and intellectual stimulation that she had derived from her time spent with Seven.  Hard as it was for her to believe or to admit even to herself, she missed the former drone.  When Tom asked her to join him the next night for a romantic dinner in St Moritz she declined, saying that she had something she needed to take care of instead.  Tom was a bit hurt that she didn't appear to be appreciating his attempts to spend more time with her and he questioned her mercilessly until she finally told him the truth.  That she wanted to spend some time with Seven.</p>

		<p>"You're kidding me right?" Tom was incredulous. "You're dumping me for the drone!"</p>

		<p>"I'm not dumping you, and I've asked you repeatedly to not call her that.  She's my friend."</p>

		<p>"Right, and my new best friend is an isolinear spanner!"</p>

		<p>"You're on real thin ice right now flyboy...just drop it."  B'Elanna growled.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry for insulting Seven, but you're always going on about how little time we spend together and now here you are running off to spend time with someone else."</p>

		<p>"I know.  Look Tom...spending time with you has been great." A small nagging part of B'Elanna's brain told her that this was not exactly true, but she quashed the thought quickly.  "It's just that Seven was there for me all the time when you were too busy for me, and I'm feeling sort of guilty for just dumping her now that you're taking an interest again.  I used to hate women like that when I was growing up.  They want to be your best friend until a guy comes along and then it's 'see ya later.'  I don't want to be one of those women."</p>

		<p>"Alright already," Tom's hands were in the air indicating surrender.  "Have fun with Seven.  Don't mind me, I'll find something to occupy my time."</p>

		<p>"I have no doubt," B'Elanna replied, standing on her toes to kiss the pilot on his cheek.  </p>

		<p>Tom tried to turn the kiss into something more, and B'Elanna couldn't stop herself from pulling away.  This had been happening with alarming frequency lately, but again B'Elanna refused to examine that aspect of her behaviour.   She ignored the flash of annoyance that crossed Tom's face and made a hasty exit in search of her friend.</p>

		<p>She found Seven hard at work in Astrometrics.  The former drone looked up when she entered the room and B'Elanna felt her heart contract at the sight of the beaming smile that graced Seven's features when she caught sight of the engineer entering the room.  Tom never looked at her like that.</p>

		<p>"Lieutenant Torres...What can I do for you."</p>

		<p>"You can agree to have dinner with me tomorrow night," B'Elanna replied with a shy grin.</p>

		<p>"Has Mr. Paris found a new project then?" Seven asked.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna felt a stab of guilt at Seven's innocent question.  She never intended to make the former Borg feel as though she were second best, and yet obviously she had.</p>

		<p>"No, actually he wanted to have dinner tomorrow as well, but I told him I wanted to spend the evening with you instead."</p>

		<p>Seven's smile grew wider at hearing B'Elanna's words.</p>

		<p>"Are you certain you wouldn't rather spend your time with him?"</p>

		<p>"Absolutely.  The truth is I've missed our time together.  It just hasn't been the same without you.... So, what do you say...is it a date?"</p>

		<p>Seven felt her face suffuse with colour at B'Elanna's terminology, and she quickly struggled to put her customary impassive look back in place before the engineer noticed.</p>

		<p>"Indeed...it is a... date," she replied, unable to keep the happiness she felt from coming through in her voice.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 5">
		<p>Seven spent part of her shift the next day at the secondary ops station on the bridge helping Harry fine-tune the ops sensor array.  As she worked, she found herself unable to resist observing Tom Paris' behaviour when B'Elanna was not on the bridge.  Seven had never really bothered to watch Tom before, the truth was he had never held much interest for her and since Voyager had cleared the nebula she was always much more interested in watching B'Elanna than in listening to the pilot's endless banter.  Today, however, B'Elanna was in engineering and Seven found herself scrutinizing Tom's behaviour in an effort to come to an understanding of just what it was that B'Elanna saw in the childish young man.  She was a little shocked by what she saw.  Paris was an inveterate flirt; he seemed unable to interact with any female without the conversation having some type of sexual innuendo attached to it.  She took her lunch break at the same time as he did and was appalled to see him carrying on his flirtation all through the meal with any female that was in range of his voice.  He was joined for lunch by Ensign Mallaley from ops and Seven observed that the flight controller frequently touched the attractive young woman's hands and arms throughout the meal.   She could overhear his flirtatious tones and was angered to see him place his hand on the small of the young ensign's back as he guided her out of the mess hall after their meal together.  True, he hadn't seemed to have gone beyond flirtation, but Seven simply couldn't understand how he could touch another woman at all when he was permitted to touch B'Elanna Torres.  She was angry with Tom for being such a child, but there was another part of her that was angry with B'Elanna for getting and staying involved with someone who held her honour in such low regard.  She wished she could intervene and make B'Elanna see that she was making a mistake by remaining in her relationship with Paris, but she knew that if she did so, her friendship with the volatile chief engineer would be the only one damaged.  She felt a heaviness on her spirit at the thought of the honourable young Klingon trapped in such a dysfunctional relationship, but there was nothing she could do about it, so she returned to Astrometrics and finished her shift from there.</p>

		<p>As saddened as Seven had been by her discoveries about the nature of B'Elanna's and Tom's relationship, she couldn't help but grow excited as the time for her date with the Klingon hybrid drew near.  They were only having dinner together at Sandrine's but even so Seven was looking forward to having the engineer all to herself for the evening.  She decided to go to the holodeck early in order to ensure that B'Elanna's favourite vintage of blood wine was stocked at the bar; she wanted this evening to be perfect.  She walked into the holographic establishment and was surprised to find the place empty and the lights dimmed much lower than usual.  She was about to order the lights up when she heard a sound emanating from the back corner of the bar.  Curious, she walked around the tables and turned the corner only to find to her shock that Tom Paris was unclothed and engaged in rather energetic sexual intercourse with Ricky...the hologram Tom had programmed into the bar, the one whose sole purpose seemed to be hanging on his every word.  Not since Janeway had summarily separated her from the collective had Seven been this furious.</p>

		<p>"Lieutenant Paris."</p>

		<p>Tom rolled off the holocharacter with amazing speed, grabbing up his discarded uniform and covering himself at the same time as he ordered the deletion of the holographic character.</p>

		<p>"What the hell do you think you're doing in here," he finally demanded when he had gathered his wits about him somewhat.</p>

		<p>"It is a public holodeck program Mr. Paris.  I would think even you would have more intelligence and discretion than to cheat on your wife in a place where you are certain to be discovered."</p>

		<p>"I have this holodeck booked for the next two hours," he ranted, "Sandrine's is running in Holodeck 1 tonight.  Now get the hell out of here."</p>

		<p>Seven was aware that Tom had a right to be angry with her now that she realized that she was trespassing in his private holodeck program, but that didn't stop her from railing at him for his disrespect of B'Elanna. </p>

		<p>"I will go and leave you to your...hobby," she spat contemptuously.  She turned to leave, but couldn't bring herself to just walk away without defending B'Elanna's honour.  She turned back to face him, her visage reddened and her body shaking with rage.</p>

		<p>"You do not deserve B'Elanna Torres.  You have no appreciation of her brilliance, or her beauty.  You could be with her and instead you choose to dishonour your relationship with a hologram.  I hope that B'Elanna finds out who you really are and chooses to leave you.  You are not worthy of her attention or her affection and you certainly are not worthy of her love."  </p>

		<p>Having said her piece Seven turned again to leave.</p>

		<p>"What makes you think she doesn't know?"  Tom's arrogant question stopped her in her tracks.</p>

		<p>"She would never condone such dishonourable behaviour in her relationship."</p>

		<p>"Oh really, and this opinion is based on what exactly?"</p>

		<p>"On my knowing of B'Elanna Torres."</p>

		<p>"Well maybe you don't know her as well as you think you do.  She knows I flirt with women, but I never cheat on her.  I only sleep with holograms.  Those are the rules of our relationship, and B'Elanna is well aware of them."</p>

		<p>Seven's mind was reeling from this information, but she refused to give in.</p>

		<p>"I do not believe you."</p>

		<p>"Look Seven, I don't expect you to understand...you've got to have emotions before you can understand them.  B'Elanna and I did the logical thing when we realized we were probably going to die here in the Delta Quadrant.  We found one another and we settled.  If I were back on Earth I probably wouldn't have bothered even chasing after her...too much temper...too much drama, and I'm pretty certain she wouldn't have given me a second glance back home.  But we aren't on Earth, we're here in the Delta quadrant and neither one of us wanted to spend the next 50 years of our lives alone.  The sex is good, we get along okay most of the time, and like I said...I'm faithful in my way.  I settled, she settled and we're happy enough...in fact, the only time we don't get along is when B'Elanna gets it in her head to pretend like we're in a real relationship."</p>

		<p>"Stop this!  I will not allow you to continue to disparage B'Elanna's character in this manner.  You should have more respect for B'Elanna than to speak of her in this way.  You need to grow up and take responsibility for your actions.  You are hurting B'Elanna and I will not allow it." Seven's hand was shaking as she pointed her finger at Tom.</p>

		<p>"What the hell is with you Seven...you'd think you had a crush on her or something."</p>

		<p>"What I feel for Lieutenant Torres is far more powerful than any crush.  My feelings for her are genuine and I wouldn't expect YOU to have any understanding of them because they are real, and run deeper than the surface."</p>

		<p>Tom was stunned by Seven's unexpected revelation, and he could tell immediately by the look on the former drone's face that she had not intended to reveal so much in her anger.  He couldn't believe that Seven of all people considered herself competition for B'Elanna's affections.  Suddenly B'Elanna's desire to have dinner with Seven this evening took on new meaning for him.  He wasn't about to let anyone interfere in his arrangement with B'Elanna.  She was his and he certainly wouldn't tolerate the Ice Queen trespassing on his property.  He struck out quickly in his resentment.</p>

		<p>"You've gotta be kidding.  B'Elanna would never be with another woman...and she certainly wouldn't stoop to letting a Borg drone touch her, so you can just put any thoughts of you and B'Elanna right out of your head.  She's with me, and that's exactly where she's going to stay.  So why don't you go back to the Cargo Bay where you belong and plug yourself in for the night, because you've got no chance with B'Elanna, not while I'm in the picture."</p>

		<p>Seven recognized the ring of truth in Tom's words and to her shame she felt tears of anger and sorrow pricking at her human eye.  She wanted to lash out at the arrogant helmsman, to defend herself and B'Elanna, but she was unable to formulate coherent thoughts.  She refused to let herself cry in front of Tom and although her heart was breaking and she couldn't see clearly for the tears in her eye, she turned and stumbled out of the holodeck...not allowing her tears to fall until she was in the corridor.  As she wandered blindly down the hallway she bumped into another crewmember.  She continued to walk away, only stopping when she heard B'Elanna's voice.</p>

		<p>"Seven, what the heck is going on...what's wrong."</p>

		<p>Seven knew she couldn't deal with talking to B'Elanna right now. She couldn't even look the beautiful engineer in the eye.</p>

		<p>"I apologize Lieutenant.  I'm sorry...I have to go."  She moved away as quickly as she could, leaving a very confused Klingon behind her.</p>

		<p>Just as B'Elanna was about to go after Seven the doors to the holodeck opened and Tom Paris stepped through.  </p>

		<p>"Tom, what the hell is going on?  I just saw Seven come out of there in tears.  What happened?"</p>

		<p>"Don't get mad at me, I just did you a huge favour.  You won't believe what the drone just told me in there."  He paused, less certain that he liked that B'Elanna would receive his news favourably.</p>

		<p>"Well...what did she tell you?  I'm waiting."</p>

		<p>"She, uh, she told me she has a crush on you.  But don't worry Lanna, I set her straight.  I told her you were with me, that you weren't interested in women.  I don't think she'll be bothering you anymore."  Tom finished with a slight bow, and then waited for B'Elanna's heartfelt thanks for his defense of her honour.</p>

		<p>"Tom...you asshole.  How dare you..."</p>

		<p>"Come on B'Elanna, what did you want me to do, stand around while the Borg assimilates you?"</p>

		<p>"Shut up Tom."  B'Elanna turned to go after Seven.</p>

		<p>"Wait a second Lanna.  Where do you think you're going?"  Tom made the mistake of grabbing her arm and it was sheer luck that she didn't break his in return.  </p>

		<p>"I'm going to make sure that Seven is alright."</p>

		<p>"Come on Lanna, I have the holodeck for another couple of hours.  Forget Seven and let's go skiing in France, or hang out on the beach in Tahiti."  B'Elanna jerked her arm free of Tom's hold and turned on her heel.</p>

		<p>"Fuck you Paris," she snarled over her shoulder.</p>

		<p>Paris smiled to himself.  She'd be back and he did still have Sandrine's, and Ricky, to himself for the next few hours.  </p>

		<p>B'Elanna was uncertain of what she was going to say to Seven. She was fairly sure that Tom was making up the whole story about Seven's crush, but the Astrometrics officer had been clearly upset when they passed in the hall.  The computer had informed her that Seven was in Cargo Bay 2 and B'Elanna hurried as fast as she could, anxious to make sure that Seven was all right.  When she entered the Cargo Bay she saw Seven sitting on the dais in front of the alcoves.  She didn't look up when the doors opened, but sat still, staring at the deck plating...the picture of dejection.</p>

		<p>"Hey Seven," she said quietly.</p>

		<p>"Hey," Seven didn't look up as she spoke.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna sat down beside her on the dais, sitting in silence for a few minutes, waiting to see if Seven would talk to her.  When it became evident that the former drone had no intention of breaking the silence B'Elanna spoke again.</p>

		<p>"I ran into Tom outside of Holodeck 2."  </p>

		<p>A lone tear tracked down Seven's pale cheek. She was certain that the helmsman would have told B'Elanna of her feelings.  She was equally certain that this would spell the end of any connection between them.</p>

		<p>"Do you want to talk about it?"</p>

		<p>"Do you?" Seven's voice barely rose above a whisper.</p>

		<p>"I think we should.  Tom told me that you...that you think you have a crush on me.  I think that's something that we should discuss."</p>

		<p>Seven couldn't believe that B'Elanna was so calm in the face of Paris's revelations.  She had expected anger, even violence, not this calm acceptance.  She tried to buy herself some time to formulate her thoughts.</p>

		<p>"What is it that you want to know?"</p>

		<p>"Do you have a crush on me Seven?"</p>

		<p>"No."</p>

		<p>"Well there you go."  B'Elanna wasn't certain whether she was relieved or not.  There was a small part of her that had wanted Seven to be attracted to her.</p>

		<p>"What I feel for you is much more than a crush.  I am in love with you B'Elanna Torres."  In the face of her uncertainty Seven had decided to opt for the unvarnished truth.</p>

		<p>"You...love...come on Seven, you can't mean..."</p>

		<p>"I assure you that is exactly what I mean.  When I told you of my experiences in the nebula I did not tell you the entire truth.  I left out the part where I watched you in your stasis tube every day; I left out the part where I spoke to you for hours, told you of my dreams and my fears.  I left out the part where my image of you watched over me as I regenerated.  I left out the part where I fell in love with you, where it was you who kept me sane and allowed me to function.  I left out the part where knowing that it would save your life I found the strength to shut down life support so that Voyager would clear the nebula and you would go on living."</p>

		<p>"But Seven...that wasn't really me.  That was just an hallucination."</p>

		<p>"I am aware that you were not actually with me during the time in the nebula, but my feelings for you became clear during that time.  I knew you would never love me back and I never intended to tell you how I felt, but I fell in love with you during that month, and everything that I have learned about you since, everything I feel when I am with you, everything that I know about you and everything that I am tells me that I do love, and will continue to love you for the rest of your life and beyond."</p>

		<p>"Seven, you can't know that...no one can.  Have you ever even been in love before?"</p>

		<p>"No, but I believe I know what I am feeling.  I am not a child B'Elanna; I know what love is."</p>

		<p>"Okay Seven, I believe you...but this is all new to you.  You can't know how you're going to feel in month's time, or a year's time.  Things change."</p>

		<p>"You are correct."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna was taken aback by Seven's easy capitulation to her argument.</p>

		<p>"It is possible that I may predecease you, therefore it is not logical to say that I will love you for the rest of your life.  All I can promise with certainty is that I will love you for the rest of my life, and I am certain that if there is an afterlife I will carry that love with me into it."</p>

		<p>It was B'Elanna's turn to feel the burning of tears behind her eyes.  In all of her life no one had ever spoken to her like this, no one had ever made her feel this way.  She looked at the tear-stained face of the beautiful blonde and felt a stirring in her heart, feelings she long ago gave up on and dismissed as unimportant were growing once more in her heart.  Seven leaned closer and B'Elanna felt pulled toward her.</p>

		<p>"Please...just this," Seven breathed softly.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna didn't answer, but leaned still closer and allowed her lips to brush softly over Seven's.  They leaned back slightly, regarding one another through half closed eyes.  Seven leaned forward once more and their lips met again, just for a moment, but it was a moment burned into eternity for both of them.</p>

		<p>"Seven...I can't...Tom," B'Elanna stammered.  </p>

		<p>Seven felt as though her heart would never beat again.  She couldn't believe that B'Elanna would choose Tom over her, not after everything she that she had told her.</p>

		<p>"Tom Paris does not love you as I do."</p>

		<p>"I know Seven, believe me I know, but it's not as simple as that.  Tom and I have a relationship, and I have to honour that commitment."</p>

		<p>"But he does not honour his commitment to you B'Elanna."</p>

		<p>"I know.  I can't explain it Seven, but Tom and I, we fit somehow, and I can't just leave him because somebody better comes along."</p>

		<p>"Do you love him?"</p>

		<p>The silence stretched between them and Seven thought perhaps B'Elanna wasn't going to answer her question.</p>

		<p>"I...I don't know.  Please Seven, don't make this harder than it is.  I'm with Tom and I can't change that, but I don't want to lose your friendship.  You're too important to me."</p>

		<p>"Friendship."  The word tasted like ashes on Seven's tongue.  It was both so much more and so much less than she had hoped for.  She had feared that when B'Elanna became aware of her feelings for her that she would be angry and no longer wish to associate with her, but she had also secretly hoped that when B'Elanna learned the extent of her feelings she would leave the childish helmsman and be with her.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry Seven, I know it isn't what you wanted, but it's all I can offer."</p>

		<p>"Then it will be enough," Seven said, hoping B'Elanna wouldn't hear the catch in her voice as she doomed herself to a life of unrequited love, and unfulfilled dreams.</p>

		<p>"So, friend," B'Elanna said with a wan smile, "do you still want to have dinner with me on the holodeck?"</p>

		<p>In that moment Seven learned how to lie and dissemble.  What she really wanted was to yell at B'Elanna and to find out if Tom Paris had been telling the truth about their relationship. What she really wanted to do was to hide herself away and never have to look at the woman she loved but could never had again.  She really wanted to cry and scream at the unfairness of life and fate that she could finally learn to love only to have that love not be returned.  Instead she forced a smile onto her face that didn't come close to reaching her eyes.</p>

		<p>"Of course...friend."</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 6">
		<p>The dinner was awkward and stilted as both B'Elanna and Seven were desperately trying not to discuss anything that had happened in the last few hours, but since neither of them could think of anything else, the conversation lagged repeatedly.  And yet, they were both grateful that they were still friends and so they endured the awkward silences and forced themselves to discuss safe topics such as sensor arrays, and engineering problems.  When they finally said goodnight they were both equally relieved to be free of one another, but also, strangely reluctant to part.  </p>

		<p>Seven was glad that she had her alcove to rely on for regeneration.  She was in such emotional turmoil that she was certain that she would not be able to rest otherwise.  She did not envy B'Elanna having to achieve sleep this evening.  The memory of B'Elanna's lips pressed against her own was burned into her memory and she replayed the moment in her mind, reliving that instant of perfection that was to be forever after denied her.  The pain she felt at B'Elanna's rejection of her love in favour of Tom Paris' tepid emotional attachment tore at her soul.  She took the only escape open to her and stepped into her alcove, leaving the pain behind and resting in the tranquil sea of cybernetic oblivion.</p>

		<p>For her part, B'Elanna was indeed unable to sleep.  She had tossed and turned for several hours before giving up and padding out to her living and replicating herself a glass of wine in an attempt to relax.  Her mind was unable to racing in circles.  Seven had admitted to loving her!  Not just a crush, but love, and B'Elanna had no doubt that the former drone was sincere.  She replayed Seven's words in her head again and again.  The idea of someone loving her in this life and beyond was something she never in her wildest dreams thought she could have-to her it was another Klingon myth that she rejected.  She had always drifted in and out of sexual liaisons, taking comfort where she could find it.  After her parent's disastrous marriage, she had begun to believe that true love was just an illusion...something people convinced themselves of so that they wouldn't have to feel so alone in the world.  In fact, with the exception of Harry Kim, B'Elanna really couldn't say that she had ever really experienced true friendship until Seven of Nine came into her life.  And now, that same person, Seven of Nine was offering her love, and she wasn't free to accept it.  She had a relationship with Tom, and she was going to honour it...even if it killed her.   'Why don't you just call it what it is Torres, it's an arrangement, nothing more,' she berated herself silently. </p>

		<p>But still she couldn't stop her treacherous mind from returning again and again to the feeling of Seven's lips against her own.  It had been exquisite, soft and gentle and totally unlike anything she had ever experienced in her life.  A bitter irony that it came too late to save her from her own disillusionment.  She had accepted Tom's offer of a relationship, and agreed to his terms, and now she would be forced to live with the consequences.  How could she have known that her salvation lay in the Delta Quadrant if only she had been strong enough to wait for it.  </p>

		<p>She knew that Tom didn't love her, and she knew all about his holographic dalliances.  She'd accepted it all from the start, thinking it was better than being alone.  At first she thought that if she was the perfect girlfriend that Tom would grow up and be the man she knew he could be, and that their relationship would grow beyond its original parameters and into something real.  That hadn't happened.  Tom usually abided by their agreement...if she didn't demand too much of him.  He tried not to flirt too openly when she was around, and as far as she knew he had never cheated on her with another member of Voyager's crew.  In moments of utter soul-baring truthfulness she admitted that she was ashamed of her deal with Paris, and that this shame led to her own self-delusions about the reality of the relationship. Sitting here now, missing Seven, she was disgusted with herself for the way she had convinced herself that what she had with Tom was a relationship...she knew now it wasn't and it would never be.  </p>

		<p>Even before Seven declared herself, B'Elanna had sometimes wished that she never gotten involved with Tom.  She hadn't been in love with him, and she knew he didn't love her.  It was just that earth was so far away, and the nights in the Delta Quadrant were long if you were alone.  She'd let Paris convince her that it was better to share something physical now than to hold out hope that someday a miracle would occur and the perfect mate would magically appear in the middle of the Delta Quadrant.</p>

		<p>But that miracle had occurred, and B'Elanna's deal with Paris was now standing between her and real love and happiness.  If only she could have loved Tom, but at the time she was convinced that she could never really love anyone...now, when it was too late, she realized that she could.  With a growl of frustration she threw her glass against the bulkhead, watching with distracted disinterest as the red wine dripped its way down the wall and onto the carpet.</p>

		<p>The next morning B'Elanna tried to compensate for her lack of sleep by taking an icy hydro shower and ensuring that her uniform was neatly pressed and her boots highly shone.  She forced herself to eat breakfast and drank two cups of strong Raktijino before heading to the conference room for the daily meeting.  She had thought long and hard into the night, and finally, just before her shift began she had realized what she needed to do in order to begin to repair the damage she had done.  The most important thing of all to her was Seven; no matter what she was determined to do the right thing for the beautiful former drone.</p>

		<p>Seven was already in the room when she arrived and for several awkward moments they were forced to make small talk together until some of the other senior officers began to filter in to the meeting.  Once the meeting was underway B'Elanna couldn't help but surreptitiously observe the former drone.  Even though Seven had her alcove to regulate her sleep she looked less than fresh and alert.  B'Elanna felt a rush of concern for her friend.  Five minutes later when Tom Paris rushed into the room full of apologies for his tardiness B'Elanna was shocked that she hadn't even realized that he wasn't there.  She shook her head, realizing that if something was to change in her relationship with the pilot it was up to her to initiate the change.  She had given up true love to honour her commitment to him, so she was more determined than ever to make it work.  Despite her best efforts however, she was unable to stop looking at Seven, wondering what was going on beneath her inscrutable features.  When the meeting broke up she had to hurry to catch up with Seven, as the former drone rushed from the room as soon as the Captain dismissed them.</p>

		<p>"Seven, hey, wait up."</p>

		<p>Seven's heart fell when she heard the lieutenant calling her name.  She had studiously avoided catching B'Elanna's eye while the meeting was in progress; even so she had been acutely aware that the engineer had been looking at her throughout the meeting.  She could sense that B'Elanna was concerned for her, but wasn't sure her heart could take another falsely cheerful conversation with the Klingon so soon after the heartache of the previous night.  Still, she stopped and waited for B'Elanna to catch up with her, forcing herself to smile despite the pain in her heart.  B'Elanna's first words put her mind as ease.</p>

		<p>"Look Seven, I know I'm probably not your favourite person in the quadrant right now, and I don't blame you.  I know last night was awful, and I don't want our friendship to go down that road.  I did a lot of thinking last night and I just wanted you to know how important you are to me, and how important it is to me that you be happy, and that our friendship stay real.  So I just wanted to tell you that anything you need right now is fine with me.  If you need some space or some time then I'll support you.  Anything you want.  I'll always be here for you, whenever you want me just call okay...I'll be there."  She was out of breath when she finished the speech she had prepared, and she stood there self-consciously for a moment waiting for a response from Seven.  When none was immediately forthcoming she looked down at her boots for a moment, then took a deep breath.</p>

		<p>"Right...well, I just wanted you to know that okay.  I...I'll see you around Seven."  She gave the former drone a sad little smile as she turned to leave</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna wait." Seven had been so taken aback by B'Elanna's speech that it had taken her a moment to gather herself together.  She hadn't intended B'Elanna to feel rejected by her silence.</p>

		<p>"I just...I wasn't expecting this."</p>

		<p>"That's me...full of surprises."  B'Elanna tried to lighten the mood a little.</p>

		<p>"I wish to thank you for your consideration of my feelings.  I, I do feel the need to have a little space from you right now," Seven's typical bluntness stung, but B'Elanna bit back any reply wanting to give Seven all the time she needed to say what was on her mind.  "But I am also determined that our relationship be 'real' as you put it.  I just need to take some time to get my feelings under control, but then I would like to resume our friendship.  I will let you know when I feel able to spend time in close proximity to you."</p>

		<p>"Okay Seven, sure...just let me know." B'Elanna forced herself to smile despite the pain in her heart at the thought of losing her friend.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna," Seven once again halted B'Elanna's retreat with her words.  "I truly appreciate what you are doing, and the strength of character required to do it.  Thank you."</p>

		<p>"You, uh, you're welcome Seven."  B'Elanna grasped Seven's bicep and squeezed firmly for a moment, trying to convey with her touch all that she was unable to put into words.  "I meant what I said, I'm here for you whenever you need me."  With that B'Elanna relinquished her grip on Seven's arm and walked quickly away down the corridor, hoping that Seven hadn't seen the tears that were now spilling freely down her face.  This time Seven let her go, but was unable to take her eyes off the retreating form of the Lieutenant until she turned a corner and was gone from sight.  Fighting back tears for what seemed like the hundredth time in the last two days she turned and made her way to Astrometrics.</p>

		<p>Seven had felt a sense of relief that B'Elanna was offering to give her some space for the next few weeks, but that feeling was short-lived and was soon replaced by a sense of loneliness and longing.  Despite what had happened between them, and no matter how difficult the former Borg knew it would be to spend time in close proximity to the Klingon hybrid knowing they would never be together, she was tempted to seek out B'Elanna's company.  Still, she knew it was illogical and that she needed the space to steel herself to deal with the engineer and so she never made the comm call, even thought her hand strayed to the badge with a will of its own every few hours.  Even through the pain she missed B'Elanna fiercely and the daily staff meetings were both heaven and hell to her as they were the only time she spent in close proximity to the object of her affections.  In the meetings she drank in B'Elanna's presence as if she had been lost in the dessert for weeks and the Klingon hybrid was water, and her salvation, but B'Elanna kept a respectful distance and they never exchanged a word.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna didn't know what to make of her time away from Seven.  Tom, who realized he'd been pushing his luck with B'Elanna lately, and who was keenly aware that he now had competition for her time and affection, had spent more time with her than he had in the previous year.  He was being very attentive and was even attempting to find things to do that didn't leave B'Elanna bored to a near coma.  She appreciated his efforts and tried to convince herself that if only things were always like this, she would be content in their arrangement.   Deep in the sleepless dark of night however, she knew she was only lying to herself.  Every moment with Tom was like a hollow mockery of the reality she knew she could have with Seven.  Their conversations were surface deep and stultifying after only a few minutes together.  She found herself becoming repulsed at the thought of him touching her and began to long for him to go back to his holograms.  Their relationship was a dark, haunting simulacrum of the reality she knew was waiting for her if only she had the courage to reach out and claim it.  Yet she continued to convince herself that it was her honour that kept her bound to Tom, and so she accepted his attention while he lavished it on her, and secretly yearned for the restoration of her friendship with Seven.  At least when she had her friendship she had real emotions, and real connection, and she knew that would help her honour her commitment to Tom by keeping her sane.  All she knew for certain was that she was miserable when she was near Seven, and even more miserable to be apart from her.</p>

		<p>Seven held out for two weeks before she broke.  She entered the mess hall one afternoon and her heart skipped a beat when she saw the Klingon hybrid eating alone in the far corner of the room.  This had happened with regularity in the days since they had stopped seeing one another, but today Seven couldn't take it any longer.  She retrieved her lunch from Neelix and after hesitating for only a moment she made her way across the room and slid into the seat across from B'Elanna.</p>

		<p>Upon seeing the object of her thoughts appear in front of her as if she had wished her into being B'Elanna froze, her fork halfway to her mouth. It wasn't until the load of noodles fell from the fork to the plate with an audible splat that the spell was broken.</p>

		<p>"Seven...hey...it's really good to see you," B'Elanna stammered, unsure of what to do now that her fondest dream appeared to be coming true.</p>

		<p>"I...am...unsure of what I'm doing here," Seven said with uncharacteristic uncertainty.  "I just...I saw you here and, I've really been missing...I just wanted to talk to you."</p>

		<p>"God, I've wanted to talk to you too...I've really missed you Seven...really," B'Elanna's voice trailed off as she realized she was gushing and that perhaps her eagerness would put Seven off.</p>

		<p>There was silence between them for several minutes. B'Elanna pushed the food around on her plate while she tried to think of something to say that wouldn't end up sounding lame or bring up something painful.  Nothing came to mind. In the end Seven broke the silence by asking B'Elanna about the diagnostics engineering were running on the EPS grid.  It was all the cue B'Elanna needed and soon they were talking a mile a minute for the rest of the lunch hour.  As they were walking to the turbolift B'Elanna decided to push her luck and ask for Seven's help on the diagnostics and to her delight the former drone agreed to assist and told B'Elanna that she would come to engineering in an hour once she had her sector scans underway.  B'Elanna felt an overwhelming sense of relief...perhaps things would turn out after all.</p>

		<p>*Several hours later*</p>

		<p>"God damn it Seven!"</p>

		<p>"You are remodulating the power couplings incorrectly Lieutenant.  It is no wonder the diagnostics have failed to pin point the source of the power drain on the grid."</p>

		<p>"Give me that," B'Elanna shouted as she grabbed for the PADD Seven was holding in order to point out the error of the other woman's statement.  </p>

		<p>Seven refused to relinquish her hold on the PADD and for a moment the two of them engaged in a rather childish tug of war before B'Elanna burst into laughter.</p>

		<p>"I fail to see the humour in your childish behaviour Lieutenant Torres."</p>

		<p>"Kahless I've really missed fighting with you Seven," she chuckled, wiping tears from her eyes.</p>

		<p>"Indeed," Seven finally relented and graced her with a small, indulgent smile. "That does not however change the fact that you are in error with your remodulation of the power couplings."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna grinned sheepishly, "Show me again."</p>

		<p>Seven shook her head and began to outline the proper formula for realigning the power couplings, resting her hand on B'Elanna's shoulder as she did so.</p>
