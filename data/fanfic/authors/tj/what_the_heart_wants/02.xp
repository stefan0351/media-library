<chapter title="Chapter 5">
<p>B'Elanna Torres warrior, Klingon, chief engineer of the Federation Starship Voyager, former Maquis and survivor of the Cardassian prison camps was terrified.  She was confused and scared and would rather do anything in the world than leave her quarters and attend the morning senior staff meeting.  The reason for her terror was also the source of her confusion and her head was splitting as she tried to negotiate the unfamiliar waters of emotions and feelings.  Give her something to fix or kill, give her a fight that had rules, an objective and a clear winner or loser and she was in her element.  This, however, was different.</p>
<p>It had become quite clear to her that she was attracted to Seven of Nine, the ship's Astrometrics officer and resident ex-Borg.  The thing was she also really liked Seven&amp;#133;over the past few weeks she had come to value her newfound friendship with the younger woman.  Yesterday they had shared an intensely emotional experience together as they showed one another painful incidents from their childhoods and had explored the dual nature of both of their lives.  At the movies that night, when Seven's leg had come to rest against her own, B'Elanna felt a fire she thought would forever be denied her.  She had never felt that kind of molten fever before, not with anyone.  But Seven was so childlike in so many ways &amp;#133;there was no telling if she knew the effect she had on B'Elanna, and there was certainly no reason for B'Elanna to believe that Seven would return her feelings.</p>
<p>So here she was on the horns of a dilemma&amp;#133;reveal her attraction and ruin the friendship&amp;#133;no that was unacceptable.  Equally unacceptable was the thought of not taking the chance that Seven might reciprocate those feelings. If all of this weren't bad enough, B'Elanna's honour wouldn't allow her to keep such a secret from someone for whom she cared deeply.  She felt like she needed to get a handle on this before she saw Seven again&amp;#133;which would be in about 10 minutes at the senior staff meeting.  'Shit, Shit, Shit, life was certainly easier when I kept myself to myself,' she grumbled to herself as she prepared to leave for the meeting.  Feelings or no feelings she had a job to do.</p>
<p>B'Elanna hurried to the meeting and as she went old habits reasserted themselves with a vengeance.  The only emotion in her life that had never failed her was anger. She knew anger well; it was the cloak with which she hid her fragile emotions and the armour with which she protected her heart.  The closer she got to the meeting the more she convinced herself that she was angry at Seven for daring to breach the carefully constructed walls that protected her heart and for bringing all of this confusion, this emotional mess, into her otherwise orderly life.  B'Elanna had a lifetime of experience with using her anger to protect herself, and by the time she got to the conference room she was convinced that she was furious with Seven for tricking her into revealing more than she wanted to about herself and her life.  She was certain she was better off without the Borg in her life. She would just ignore her, cut her dead and go back to the way they were before the day Seven intruded on her private grief in the holodeck.</p>
<p>The doors to the conference room opened and the first, the only, thing B'Elanna saw was Seven of Nine sitting in a chair on the opposite side of the table.  The angry young engineer looked her straight in the eye and prepared herself to turn away without even acknowledging the Borg's existence when Seven smiled at her. A brilliant, beautiful smile that lit up the young woman's normally inscrutable face, and brought an answering grin from B'Elanna in a heartbeat. 'Oh, Kahless you are so much trouble Torres,' she chided herself as she walked around the table to claim the empty chair beside Seven.</p>
<p>"Good morning B'Elanna," Seven's voice was pitched so low that only B'Elanna could have heard the words, and when she did she felt a flush creep over her face.</p>
<p>The young engineer clamped down on her raging emotions with every bit of Klingon control at her disposal, and whispered "Morning Seven." </p>
<p>The meeting seemed to drone on interminably and by the end of it neither the chief engineer nor the ship's usually infallible astrometrics officer could have recalled a single item that had been discussed.</p>
<p>As they left the room Seven walked beside B'Elanna, and when they were out of earshot of the rest of the crew she began shyly, "Lieut&amp;#133;.B'Elanna, I wish to thank you for yesterday.  I had a wonderful time.  I am pleased that we could facilitate our friendship by sharing our emotional responses to our childhoods."</p>
<p>B'Elanna could tell how nervous Seven was by the way she fell back into Borg-speak to cover the extent of her emotions.  She was just about to reply when Seven spoke again, almost in a whisper. "Did you mean what you said?"</p>
<p>"About what Seven?"  They were stopped in the corridor now, facing each other.  "That this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship."  Seven didn't breathe until she saw B'Elanna smile.</p>
<p>"Of course I meant it Seven.  Did you think I would lie about something like that?"</p>
<p>"Never," Seven replied vehemently.  "I merely thought that once you had a chance to think about it you would change your mind and not wish to be friends with&amp;#133;. someone like me." 'Some <b>thing</b> like me,' Seven thought bitterly to herself.</p>
<p>"You mean someone brilliant, caring and wonderful?"  B'Elanna queried.  "Yeah why would I want to be friends with someone like that," she grinned at Seven?</p>
<p>"You truly believe that I am those things?"  Seven couldn't believe what she was hearing.</p>
<p>"I'm not really given to saying things I don't mean Seven."</p>
<p>"No you are not."  Seven couldn't keep the smile off her face, and B'Elanna was certain she'd never seem such a beautiful sight before in her life. She was also certain that if they stood in the hallway smiling like this much longer no amount of Klingon control was going to stop her from doing something she might regret.  </p>
<p>"We'd better get to work Seven&amp;#133;this ship can't get along without us you know," B'Elanna joked to mask her embarrassment at exhibiting her emotions so publicly.</p>
<p>Seven cocked her optical implant. "Indeed&amp;#133;. I should analyze the sensor readings from yesterdays scans."  </p>
<p>The two friends reluctantly parted as they began their duty shifts.</p>
<p>Seven found that by concentrating intensely she could manage to put last night out of her mind for up to 10 minutes at a stretch, during which time she worked furiously at her analysis of yesterday's scans.  She was unfamiliar with the sensation of not being in total control of her thoughts.  She felt positively&amp;#133;scattered.  Her analysis had already taken an hour longer than it should have, and for the first time she cursed her eidetic memory.  Unbidden, her mind would flash back to yesterday, and how it felt to hold the sobbing engineer in her arms, how it felt when they brushed against one another in the darkened theatre, and how it felt when B'Elanna had wrapped her arm around her waist and quoted the line from the movie.  She could hear every word and feel every sensation and she had to lean against her console to stop her knees from giving out from underneath her.  She looked down at her console and realized that she had been lost in thought yet once more for over 15 minutes.  Annoyed with her lack of discipline she returned to her work.</p>
<p>Finally after another hour Seven was finished her work.  She transferred the results of her scans to Ops and sent a copy to the Captain.  She hesitated a moment to ensure that her voice was under control and then she tapped her Comm badge.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Seven of Nine to Torres&amp;gt;</p>
<p>B'Elanna started up at the sound of Seven's disembodied voice over the comm.  She had also been unable to concentrate on her work this morning.  She had several reports to complete, and each time she began to fill out the forms, her mind would begin to wander. No matter what she did, her mind would always bring her back to Seven.  It took her a second to realize that Seven was actually talking to her and that, for once this morning, she wasn't daydreaming.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Go ahead Seven&amp;gt;</p>
<p>&amp;lt;I have finished my duties in Astrometrics and wish to know if you require any assistance in Engineering&amp;gt;</p>
<p>A plan began forming in B'Elanna's mind and she smiled to herself as she replied.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Absolutely Seven, whenever you're ready&amp;gt;</p>
<p>&amp;lt;On my way, Seven out&amp;gt;</p>
<p>B'Elanna left her office and spoke to Vorik for a few minutes.  While he was relived that he would not have to be the one to repair the blown plasma conduit in the aft nacelle, he was a little surprised to hear the Chief volunteer to do the dirty work. It was no secret that the Chief enjoyed hands on work much more than her more esoteric duties, but crawling through all those Jefferies tubes to one of the filthiest places on the ship seemed a bit overboard even for the Chief.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna was immensely pleased with herself.  If she couldn't concentrate on her paperwork at least she could be productive, and spend some time alone with Seven.  A most efficient plan. </p>
<p>"Your plan seems most inefficient," Seven looked at B'Elanna with her implant cocked.  She could not believe what B'Elanna was proposing. "It does not require the combined skillset of two of the best engineers onboard Voyager to repair a damaged plasma conduit.  Our attentions would be better off directed somewhere else."</p>
<p>B'Elanna was at a loss as to how to explain herself.  She had forgotten that she was dealing with Seven of Nine and her implacable logic.  "Umm, Its just that&amp;#133;Well being in the nacelle&amp;#133;it's a really important conduit&amp;#133;if anything were to happen before it was repaired&amp;#133;well&amp;#133;" B'Elanna's voice trailed off.  There was just no way she was going to be able to get out of this one.  She was about to back down when she a look flash over Seven's face.</p>
<p>"Of course.  I understand.  We should proceed immediately."</p>
<p>B'Elanna couldn't believe her luck, or Seven's abrupt change of mind, but she wasn't about to argue.  She gathered up the necessary tools and led the way out of engineering, trying very hard to keep a satisfied smile off her face.</p>
<p>Seven understood that B'Elanna simply wanted to spend time alone with her; she was less certain as to the reasons why.  Seven's growing attraction to the petite engineer led her to hope that B'Elanna might reciprocate those feelings, and her transparent ploy to allow them to be alone was giving fuel to the flames of hope that were flickering in Seven's heart.  But as Seven had only limited experience with friendship and none at all with love, she wasn't able to interpret the signals B'Elanna exhibited.  She was unsure as to whether the beautiful young Klingon was seeking friendship or something more.  Her own self-loathing about her Borg nature led her to believe it would be impossible for someone as warm and vibrant and alive as B'Elanna to care for a cold emotionless drone like herself.  And yet still she hoped&amp;#133; </p>
<p>It was a long and exhausting climb and crawl to get to the aft nacelle and they were both filthy and exhausted by the time they arrived.  B'Elanna shoved the tools next to the damaged conduit, removed her uniform jacket, and sat down with her back against the bulkhead as she rested a few moments before beginning the work.  The truth was that now that she had Seven all to herself out here she had no clue as to what to say.  He own ulterior motives were getting in the way of the easy friendship the two of them had developed over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Seven, also looking slightly the worse for wear, was crouching in the conduit watching B'Elanna carefully.  She sensed that the older woman was feeling uneasy and feared that already B'Elanna was regretting her overtures of friendship.  To cover her own disappointment Seven began unpacking the tools and removing the access panel to the plasma conduit.</p>
<p>When the cover was open B'Elanna grabbed a tricorder and, flipping onto her back, slid into the access hatch to assess the damage that had been done when the conduit cracked.  She was glad of the fact that she no longer had to look at Seven.  She had seen a look that she was certain had been annoyance cross Seven's face before she had begun to unpack the tools and was worried that the young Borg was less than pleased at having been coerced into this little endeavor.</p>
<p>"Hmm, doesn't look too bad, but it's a good thing we have those extra gelpacks&amp;#133;I think we need to replace at least two of them while we're here.  There seems to be some kind of corrosion at the couplings on two of the packs closest to the conduit."</p>
<p>She handed her tricorder out to Seven and then asked for an isolinear spanner to begin the removal of the conduit.  Seven handed her the tool, careful not to allow contact between their hands, and then she began the work of preparing the new conduit for installment.  It was delicate work and she was glad of the distraction.  It was too easy for her to lose herself in her observations of the Klingon's muscular frame as she worked. B'Elanna had only been wearing her gray Starfleet issue tank top under her uniform jacket and her shapely arms were covered in a sheen of sweat as she worked.  It was most&amp;#133;distracting.  It was clear to her that B'Elanna did not return her affections and she did not wish to dishonour the young woman by observing her body uninvited.</p>
<p>Once the new conduit was installed B'Elanna began to remove the damaged gelpacks.  As she tugged at the first one to free it from its connection, some of the corrosion flaked off and fell into her eyes.</p>
<p>"SHIT!"  She levered herself out of the access hatch and began rubbing her eyes as the tears streamed down her face.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Torres, please stop touching your eyes.  I believe you will damage yourself further."  Seven grabbed B'Elanna's hands away from her face and held them tightly in her own.  "Let me see please," Seven's voice was pleading now and B'Elanna forced herself to sit still.  She wasn't really in much pain, but she had been startled. She began to calm down until she realized just how close she really was to Seven's body.  She felt her heart begin to hammer in her chest.</p>
<p>Seven herself was not unaffected by her close contact with the young engineer.  She took a second to issue a command to her nanoprobes to slow her heartbeat and respiration levels to normal and to stop her hands from trembling as she took B'Elanna's face in her hands and tilted her head back.  She very gently began to remove the debris from her friend's watering eyes.</p>
<p>It took several minutes to complete her task and as she worked she was aware of the sound of B'Elanna's twin hearts beating rapidly.  She heard her sharp intake of breath as Seven touched her face, and she was forced to clamp down on her own reactions to stop her hands from shaking as she carefully worked.</p>
<p>When she was done she held B'Elanna's face in both her hands and watched as the Klingon blinked the last of the tears away.  Finally able to see clearly, B'Elanna found she was looking up into the concerned face of the beautiful Borg.</p>
<p>"I trust you are&amp;#133;undamaged B'Elanna," Seven queried softly, continuing to hold the engineer's face gently in her hands.</p>
<p>"Yeah, thanks Seven&amp;#133;I'm fine now."  B'Elanna made no effort to move away from Seven's touch and the two stayed that way for almost a minute&amp;#133;just looking at each other.</p>
<p>Finally they reluctantly parted and began to finish the repair.  B'Elanna was just replacing the last gelpack and was still unsure as to what to do about Seven. 'Kahless Torres, are you a warrior or a Tikka cat...just ask her already,' she chided herself mentally. </p>
<p>It was not, however, until they had finished packing up the tools that she was able to muster the courage to speak.  "Seven, I, ah, was wondering if you might like to have dinner with me tonight?"</p>
<p>"That would be nice, perhaps we could meet in the messhall after we have had a chance to clean up a little."</p>
<p>"Actually Seven, I was hoping you'd have dinner with me in my quarters."</p>
<p>"That would be lovely," Seven replied as a blush crept over her features.  "I will have to go to Sickbay to use the sonic shower, I could come to your quarters after if you would like."</p>
<p>"You don't have a sonic shower in your quarters?"</p>
<p>"I 'live' in the Cargo Bay, it hardly seems practical to install a shower there, not to mention the fact that crewmembers need access to the room on a regular basis.  It makes more sense to shower in Sickbay."</p>
<p>"No it doesn't&amp;#133;you have as much right to privacy as anyone on board this ship.  It's not right that you have to go all the way to sick bay just to clean up."  B'Elanna was indignant on her friend's behalf.</p>
<p>"I do not mind."</p>
<p>"Well I mind&amp;#133;you can shower at my place tonight if you'd like.  Maybe I should talk to the Captain tomorrow about getting you some quarters.  You should have a place to call your own."</p>
<p>Seven did not see the need for her to have her own quarters, but she was so enchanted at the thought that this time B'Elanna's anger was on her behalf, and not directed at her, that she made no comment.</p>
<p>They made their way back to engineering and Seven replaced the tools while B'Elanna looked over the schedule for the next day and finished the report she had been working on before they left to repair the conduit.  Finally they logged off duty and left engineering together.</p>
<p>When they arrived at her quarters B'Elanna once again removed her uniform jacket and washed her hands as she said, "Why don't you grab a shower first and I'll start dinner, then you can keep an eye on it while I get ready."</p>
<p>Seven looked down at her filthy biosuit. "I do not have anything to change into after I shower," she said.</p>
<p>"Go ahead and replicate whatever you need, or you can borrow something of mine if you'd like."</p>
<p>In truth there was nothing Seven would have liked more than to wear an article of B'Elanna's clothing, but she was still unsure exactly what was going on and so she opted to simply replicate another biosuit before heading in to the bedroom ensuite to take her shower.</p>
<p>B'Elanna began to prepare dinner, working furiously so she wouldn't have time to think about the fact that a beautiful, naked Seven of Nine was just meters away in her sonic shower. She had everything just about ready when Seven emerged from her bedroom looking, as ever, like perfection.</p>
<p>"This will take another half hour or so&amp;#133;just make sure it doesn't get overdone.  I won't be long."</p>
<p>True to her word it was only twenty minutes or so before B'Elanna emerged from the bedroom looking clean, dressed in a pair of tight blue denim pants and a white tee shirt that contrasted nicely with the colour of her skin.</p>
<p>Seven was taken aback by how different B'Elanna looked out of her uniform.  She seemed so much younger, and her powerful frame was so much more evident when it wasn't hidden by the loose fabric of her Starfleet uniform.</p>
<p>Together they set the table.  B'Elanna wanted to light candles and dim the lights but she was unsure of how Seven would react to that.  'Maybe she thinks we're just two friends having dinner together.  I don't even know if she thinks this is a date or not.'  She settled for lighting candles but not dimming the lights.</p>
<p>"Seven, why don't you pick out some music for dinner," she said as she put the finishing touches on dinner.</p>
<p>Seven went to the console and scanned through B'Elanna's personal music files and selected several that she recognized from her own limited exposure to music.  She chose several pieces of music from ancient earth, an art form known as jazz, as well as some more contemporary orchestral pieces.</p>
<p>'Hmm, soft jazz, maybe she knows this is a date after all,' B'Elanna thought to herself.</p>
<p>They chatted throughout dinner, mostly about work however, leading B'Elanna to reassess her reassessment as to whether or not Seven felt they were on an actual date or not.  By the end of the meal B'Elanna still couldn't really tell what Seven was thinking.</p>
<p>After dinner they cleared away the dishes, recycling everything, and then B'Elanna led the way back to the living room and curled up on the couch.  Seven sat on the couch as well, but at the opposite end. 'Well, what did you think Torres, you'd cook one meal and she'd just jump on you the second you sat down.' They continued to chat, but the silences were growing longer, and B'Elanna was feeling uncomfortable.  She had long ago lost the ability to make eye contact with Seven, afraid of bursting into hysterical laughter or worse.  Seven was feeling confused by the obvious tension that was growing between them.  She longed to touch B'Elanna, but it was steadily becoming more difficult for her to even speak.</p>
<p>Finally, when they both moved to put their arms on the back of the couch, their hands met&amp;#133;there was an instant of hesitation when they both froze, but finally they turned to face one another and their eyes locked. Their world seemed at once to expand to encompass the entire galaxy and at the same time contract until all that existed was this gaze.  In one another's eyes they recognized an acknowledgement that if they took the next step, nothing would ever be the same between them.</p>
<p>Time drew out like a blade. The moment stretched to infinity and beyond as they leaned closer, closer still, until their lips were mere inches apart.</p>
<p>"Seven, I&amp;#133;" B'Elanna's voice was a hoarse whisper, filled with unspoken desire.</p>
<p>"Please&amp;#133;" was all Seven could manage in reply.</p>
<p>Finally their lips met&amp;#133;just the barest of brushes; it was like the flashpoint of a fire that has been smoldering forever.  The kiss deepened as they pulled one another closer in the age-old desire for two to become one.  B'Elanna pulled Seven's lower lip into her mouth, sucking on it fiercely then gently nipping it before she let go.  She flicked her tongue out gently seeking an entrance that was instantly granted and gasped as Seven's tongue began a sweet and tortuous dance with her own. </p>
<p>It was as if a dam had burst in Seven&amp;#133;all the feelings and emotions she had tried for so long to deny even existed came flooding out.  She clutched B'Elanna to her&amp;#133;moaning at the sensation of heat and melting she was experiencing.  She let her hands explore B'Elanna's back and shoulders and tangle in her beautiful hair.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna pressed forward, gently pushing Seven down as she reached for her shapely legs and pulled them up onto the couch.  She was now lying on top of Seven, their legs tangling together, and she growled as Seven's hands began to massage the sensitive ridges of her lower back.  </p>
<p>Not content with the amount of access she had, Seven pulled B'Elanna's tee shirt free of her jeans before she slid her hand under the waist band, moaning as she finally came into contact with B'Elanna's burning skin. She let her fingers roam freely over the ridges of B'Elanna's back, exploring each one thoroughly before moving on.  She then trailed her fingers up her lover's pronounced spine, enjoying the feel of B'Elanna's fevered flesh under her hands.</p>
<p>B'Elanna reached up and freed Seven's hair, growling her pleasure as the silky tresses cascaded over her face.  She arched into the contact Seven was making with her back and then eased up onto her elbow so she could free one hand to explore the supple body that was now writhing beneath her on the couch.  She reached back, grasping Seven's slim thigh, sliding her hand firmly up the beautiful body, lightly brushing the side of her ample breast before cupping the young drone's cheek.</p>
<p>The sensation of B'Elanna caressing her starburst implant caused Seven to groan with the pleasure, and she moved her hands down to grasp B'Elanna's behind, pulling her into closer contact. She whimpered as she felt B'Elanna break their kiss, but sighed out loud as she felt the Klingon move to ravish her neck with a searing trail of kisses and nips that ended only when B'Elanna reached her ear and began to nip gently at her earlobe.  The sound of B'Elanna purring in her ear, combined with all of the other sensations, was almost too much for Seven&amp;#133;she closed her eyes feeling dizzy with pleasure.</p>
<p>B'Elanna twisted their bodies so that they were now lying on their sides, and she moved her leg so it was between Seven's thighs.  She felt the drone shudder as she arched into the contact.  She continued ravishing Seven's neck with kisses, moving her hand down to cup her breast, feeling the nipple harden instantly in her palm. </p>
<p>Seven inhaled B'Elanna's scent as she buried her face in the young engineer's neck.  She could hear the distinctive beat of B'Elanna's hearts hammering even over the sound of her purrs.  Unable to restrain herself any longer, Seven reached up and laid her palm over B'Elanna's small, firm breast.  Her nipple was achingly hard and Seven took it in her fingers, rolling her thumb over the top as B'Elanna growled with pleasure.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was rapidly losing the battle with the Klingon side of her personality, which was urging her to go ahead and take the young beauty moaning in her arms.  She reached down, cupping her hand between Seven's legs, rubbing her gently through her clothing.  She heard Seven cry out with pleasure and realized if she didn't slow things down quickly there would be no stopping them.  She knew Seven had no experience, and it was up to her to protect the young woman&amp;#133;even if it meant protecting Seven from B'Elanna herself.  She pressed gently one last time, enjoying the heat radiating from Seven's core, and then slowly wrapped her arms around the young drone.  She kissed her deeply and then slowly, gently moved the young woman away.</p>
<p>Seven whimpered as she felt B'Elanna push her away, she did not want to stop this activity.  At the same time she was grateful B'Elanna was slowing down their headlong rush.  She knew that she wanted to be with B'Elanna, but so much had happened, and so little had been said, she knew they might both regret it if they went any further.  She rested her forehead against B'Elanna's ridges and stole several more kisses before settling down in her lover's arms.</p>
<p>They lay without speaking for a long time, just enjoying the sensation of being held and loved.  Finally, B'Elanna moved her head back so she could look at Seven.  She was amazed, as always, with how beautiful the younger woman was.  </p>
<p>"Wow, Seven. I had no idea&amp;#133;I, are you OK," she cried as she saw the tears shining in Seven's eyes?</p>
<p>"I am happy, and afraid&amp;#133;I have never felt like this before&amp;#133;I&amp;#133;" Seven's voice trailed off as she began to cry quietly.</p>
<p>"Shhh, hush sweetie. Everything is going to be OK.  I'm right here, and I'm not going anywhere."  B'Elanna continued to murmur lovingly to Seven until she felt the young Borg's body began to relax.  Finally the actions and emotions of the day overcame both of them and they drifted off to sleep in one another's arms.</p>

<chapter title="Chapter 6">
<p>B'Elanna opened her eyes.  The lights in her quarters were still on at half intensity and she was lying on her couch holding a sleeping Seven of Nine.  She stretched her head back slowly feeling the kinks in her neck from sleeping in such an unusual position.  She spoke softly hoping not to awaken Seven; "Computer what time is it?"</p>
<p>"The time is 0231 hours."</p>
<p>She felt Seven stir in her arms and watched in wonder as the beautiful young woman opened her eyes and smiled upon seeing B'Elanna's face.</p>
<p>"Hey sleepyhead," B'Elanna teased.</p>
<p>"I really was asleep wasn't I," Seven queried softly?</p>
<p>"Sure, why?"</p>
<p>"It is just that I have never achieved a state of sleep before," she yawned.</p>
<p>"Never?"</p>
<p>"No, I do not believe I have ever been relaxed enough to perform this task before."</p>
<p>"Well, congratulations." B'Elanna paused, unsure of how to approach her next question.  "Um, Seven, do you need to regenerate before work tomorrow?"</p>
<p>"I believe that a period of sleep will be sufficient."</p>
<p>"OK, its just, I&amp;#133;"</p>
<p>"You wish me to leave so you can return to your bed&amp;#133;of course&amp;#133;. I apologize for keeping you up this late."  Seven began to get up from the couch.</p>
<p>"No no, slow down sweetie." B'Elanna held the young Borg firmly in her arms to prevent her from escaping the room.</p>
<p>"If you think you can sleep why don't you just stay here.  You can have my bed, and I'll stay out here," B'Elanna offered.</p>
<p>"I would rather stay with you B'Elanna."  The need and the loneliness was so evident in Seven's words that B'Elanna felt her throat constrict and she had to fight back tears as she felt her own solitude echoed in her lover's words.</p>
<p>Without saying a word, B'Elanna climbed off the sofa and offered her hand to Seven, leading her into the bedroom.</p>
<p>"I guess you'll need something to sleep in," B'Elanna said almost to herself.</p>
<p>"I usually regenerate in my biosuit."</p>
<p>"That might not too comfortable once you get into bed.  I can replicate something for you if you like, or, you could wear something of mine."</p>
<p>This time Seven wasn't afraid of the answer to the question. "I believe I would like to wear an article of your clothing B'Elanna."</p>
<p>B'Elanna smiled softly and rummaged through her drawer. "Hmm, the shorts shouldn't be a problem but I'm not sure I have a top that will work.  Hang on, these might fit," She pulled out a pair of silk boxer shorts and an old, oversized Starfleet academy tee shirt and handed the bundle to Seven.  </p>
<p>She rummaged some more and pulled out another pair of boxers, black, with a matching silk tank top that only covered part of her midriff.  Unsure of what to do next she opted to change in the bathroom and give Seven the bedroom while she undressed.</p>
<p>She waited until she was reasonably sure that Seven would have had time to change and then came back into the bedroom.  Seven was standing in front of the mirror staring at herself.  She looked absolutely adorable in B'Elanna's old clothes.</p>
<p>"Whatcha doin' Seven?"  B'Elanna inquired.</p>
<p>"I have never worn anything but a biosuit before now.  I am unused to my appearance, and unused to the sensation of this type of material next to my skin."  The truth was Seven loved the feel of the cotton and silk against her body.  She could smell B'Elanna's scent on the clothes and reveled in the idea of wearing something that had been so close to B'Elanna's skin.</p>
<p>"Well, you look great," B'Elanna breathed, coming up to Seven and wrapping her arms around her from behind, resting her forehead on the taller woman's shoulder.  She stared at their reflections in the mirror, thinking of how opposite they were in almost every way, but of how right it felt for them to be together like this.</p>
<p>"C'mon, we should try to get some sleep," B'Elanna gave Seven a final squeeze and then led her to the bed.  She pulled back the covers and then crawled in, lying on her back and watching as Seven gently eased her lanky frame onto the mattress. She lay flat on her back with her arms at her sides and stared at the ceiling for a few moments, adjusting to the feeling of the bed and pillow, then she turned to look at B'Elanna.</p>
<p>"I believe I am ready to attempt sleeping again," she smiled shyly B'Elanna.</p>
<p>"C'mere you," said B'Elanna as she pulled Seven into her arms, kissing her softly before settling the blonde head on her shoulder.  Seven wrapped her arm around B'Elanna and insinuated her leg between the Klingon's, snuggling deeply into the warm embrace.  B'Elanna called the lights down and they lay in the dark, each listening to the soft breathing of the other as they floated off to sleep.</p>
<hr/>
<p>For the first time in her adult life Seven of Nine awoke in a proper bed.  She felt at once sleepy and disoriented, but also wonderful.  With every breath she could smell B'Elanna's marvelous spicy scent, and with her head resting on the Klingon's shoulder she could hear her hearts beating in a steady powerful rhythm.  She was perfectly content to lay in B'Elanna's arms and watch her sleep until the computer announced that it was time for them to get up.</p>
<p>When B'Elanna finally woke up she was amazed at the fact that she didn't feel awkward in the least lying here with Seven.  In fact it felt perfectly natural and perfectly wonderful.  </p>
<p>"Morning Seven."  B'Elanna tilted her head down to capture Seven's lips.  Seven eased her body on top of B'Elanna's and returned the kiss with a passion before settling back down in her lover's arms.  They lay snuggled together in the warmth of the bed for several minutes until B'Elanna kissed Seven one last time and reluctantly got up and made her way to the shower.</p>
<p>Seven stretched herself out slowly, loving the feeling of the bed beneath her.  She rolled over and was instantly enveloped in the warmth of B'Elanna's recently vacated spot on the bed. She stood up slowly, allowing her body time to adjust to the unfamiliar sensation of rising after a prolonged period of lying horizontally.  Her physiology quickly adjusted and she padded out into the living area, enjoying the feeling of the loose clothing moving over her body. </p>
<p>For the first time she allowed herself to explore B'Elanna's personal space.  There was a large Bat'leth hanging on one wall, and a small display of other Klingon weaponry below that.  There were also holopictures of several crewmembers including Ensign Kim and the Captain, and behind those pictures were several older ones that Seven assumed were of B'Elanna's family.  She recognized the face of B'Elanna's father from the holoprogram and assumed the older Klingon woman he was with was B'Elanna's mother.  There were a few other momentos scatter about the room, but the overall impression was of a spare and orderly life.  The only mess was the console that was littered with PADDs and a few assorted tools.  Looking about the room it was obvious that the driving force in B'Elanna's life was her job.  Seven approved of the engineer's single-minded focus on her job, but at the same time she felt a sadness that there wasn't more joy in B'Elanna's life. She smiled softly to herself thinking that perhaps that would change in the near future.</p>
<p>She walked to the replicator and began obtaining the necessary ingredients to make B'Elanna's favourite banana pancakes.  She was thoroughly engaged in her task and didn't notice that B'Elanna was in the room and had been watching her for several minutes.</p>
<p>B'Elanna, upon finishing her shower, had pulled on her uniform pants, boots and tank top, grabbed her tunic and had been about to enter the living area when she stopped, transfixed at the sight of Seven of Nine. The younger woman was still dressed in B'Elanna's old clothes, her hair loose and cascading over her face; she was carefully mixing ingredients in the cooking area.  Her concentration was evident by the sight of the tip of a small pink tongue protruding from the side of her mouth as she stirred what looked to B'Elanna like pancake batter.  She was beautiful, and B'Elanna had to remind herself to breathe.  She could not believe her luck at having found something this wonderful with someone as special as Seven of Nine. </p>
<p>Finally realizing that she couldn't just stand and stare all day, much as she'd like to, she stepped into the room and tossed her jacket over the back of the chair.  She moved behind Seven placing her hands on the drone's shapely hips and peered around her shoulder at what Seven was making.</p>
<p>"Mmm, is that banana pancake batter I smell?"</p>
<p>Seven merely nodded and continued her careful preparations.</p>
<p>"You didn't have to make me breakfast you know&amp;#133;we could've gone to the messhall."</p>
<p>Seven leaned back into B'Elanna's body, enjoying the feel of the Klingon's firm muscles, more than capable of supporting her weight.  "I wished to make you something special to thank you for last night," she said shyly.</p>
<p>"Seven, sweetie, last night was special for me too, I should be thanking you."</p>
<p>Seven put down the bowl and turned to face B'Elanna, her blue eyes bored into the Klingon's, "Was it?"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Was last night special for you&amp;#133;I am unsure of what it meant to you."  The young Borg's fear and confusion was obvious, and B'Elanna pulled her into a warm embrace.</p>
<p>"Of course it was special, YOU are special.  Seven, listen to me, I would never do something like that with someone I didn't care for, and I would never toy with your affections like that.  This is exactly why I stopped us from going further than we did.  I know we have to talk, but we also have to get to work.  So listen carefully.  I care about you Seven, and I'm not going anywhere&amp;#133;we are going to talk about this and figure out where we are going, together&amp;#133;so please don't worry&amp;#133;just try to be happy.  I know I am&amp;#133;happy that is&amp;#133;" The Klingon's uncharacteristic outburst of emotions left her rather drained and she buried her face in Seven's neck, feeling the young Borg's pulse pounding, she drew in a deep breath and savoured the intoxicating aroma of her lover.</p>
<p>Seven knew she could trust B'Elanna.  She instinctively knew that the Klingon's honour would prevent her from lying just to get out of an awkward situation, and she was thrilled to hear B'Elanna say that she cared and found her to be 'someone special.'  She held the young engineer closely for several minutes before lifting her head and bending to capture B'Elanna's lips in a searing kiss.  </p>
<p>"I believe you, and I wish you to know that I also care deeply for you."  Her nervousness at the unfamiliar situation caused her to fall back into Borg-speak, but to B'Elanna they were the sweetest words she'd ever heard.</p>
<p>"Well, now that that's settled you should jump in the shower and I'll finish up out here."</p>
<p>"But, I wished to make your breakfast for you," Seven protested.</p>
<p>"You already did the hard work.  I'll just heat up the pan and start making them while you get ready&amp;#133;go on&amp;#133;otherwise we'll be late for the meeting."</p>
<p>Seven reluctantly left for the shower.  She hated to remove the clothes B'Elanna had lent her, and she couldn't stop herself from bunching them up and burying her nose in the bundle, loving the way her scent and B'Elanna's mingled together on the clothing.  She then folded them carefully and placed them on the bed before entering the shower room.  </p>
<p>She was fascinated by the little bottles that B'Elanna kept in her bathroom.  She removed the cap from several of them and smelled the scented oils and lotions that were reminiscent of B'Elanna's own scent.  She knew she didn't have time to explore to her heart's content just now, so she replaced the bottles and stepped into the shower.</p>
<p>Seven emerged from the bedroom, once again clothed in her biosuit, and saw that B'Elanna had begun to set the table.  She stepped into the kitchen and took over making the last of the breakfast.  Cooking complete, they sat down and began to eat.</p>
<p>"These are delicious Seven, just like my Grandmother used to make."</p>
<p>Seven smiled at the praise and tentatively tried her first bite.  B'Elanna watched, amused, as Seven carefully put the tiny bite of pancake in her mouth and closed her eyes as she savoured the flavour.  A smile spread over her face and B'Elanna grinned as she saw the markedly increased size of Seven's next bite.</p>
<p>"I guess you like it huh?"</p>
<p>"It is <i>wonderful</i>, I had no idea that nutritional supplements could be this good.  Please pass the syrup B'Elanna."</p>
<p>B'Elanna obliged and laughed as Seven drowned her pancakes in the gooey liquid, and proceeded to devour her plateful. She also entertained several, rather erotic, thoughts as to what they could do with the syrup later. She loved to see Seven in unguarded moments like this, when she simply showed her emotions and didn't try to hide behind her cool Borg exterior.  She was so childlike in these moments that B'Elanna was always gripped with an urge to protect her.  She knew without a doubt that she would spill her last drop of blood before she would ever allow Seven to be hurt.</p>
<p>Breakfast over, they cleared the dishes away to be recycled.  As they worked B'Elanna noticed a drop of syrup still clinging to the side of Seven's mouth.  She reached up and wiped it gently away, surprised when Seven captured her finger and placed it in her mouth, gently sucking the last remnants of the sweet liquid from B'Elanna's finger.  "Mine," Seven declared.  'Oh, you have no idea,' B'Elanna thought to herself as Seven unwitting quoted a line from the Klingon mating ritual.</p>
<p>B'Elanna's knees nearly gave way at the heartstopping sensation of having her finger suddenly pulled into the warm and sensuous mouth of Seven of Nine.  She grabbed the young drone's shoulder for support while she regained her equilibrium, and then, as Seven released her finger, she cupped the beautiful young woman's chin in her hand and kissed her, gently at first and then more deeply as she tried to convey all that she was feeling without words.  It was Seven's turn to require support, and B'Elanna gave it willingly.</p>
<p>They reluctantly broke apart, still in a gentle embrace, content for now to simply smile at one another.</p>
<p>"We really should get going to the meeting Seven or we're going to be late.  Just, please remember that I'm here for you and that everything is going to be all right. OK?"  B'Elanna looked deeply into her lover's eyes.</p>
<p>"Thank you&amp;#133;I believe I will 'miss you' today," Seven began shyly.</p>
<p>"Well, you know you're always welcome in engineering."</p>
<p>Seven cocked her optical implant at B'Elanna's statement.  "Indeed&amp;#133;I seem to remember a certain Chief Engineer threatening to make me a part of the ship's hull if I ever touched her precious engines again&amp;#133;That was you was it not, or is my eidetic memory failing me?" </p>
<p>"I, uh, right&amp;#133;but there are other things to do in engineering besides touch my precious engines.  There are several tool lockers that need to be assimilated into some sense of order," B'Elanna grinned.</p>
<p>"I believe that you are lucky we need to depart for the morning meeting right now or the tool lockers are not all that might be 'assimilated,'" Seven's smile belied the stern voice she used to deliver her comment.</p>
<p>"Well then, we don't want to be late do we," B'Elanna said, grasping Seven's shoulders and planting one last kiss on those luscious lips before fast-walking out of her quarters, snagging her jacket from the chair as she went, leaving a slightly dazed drone to scurry after her departing form.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The meeting went as expected, engineering was running at peak efficiency. Food and dilithium stores were at acceptable levels, and sensor sweeps of the area had detected nothing of interest for the next several hundred light years. Life was good in the Delta quadrant.  Sensor sweeps of the conference room however, would have picked up a curious anomaly&amp;#133;that being the Chief Astrometrics officer and the Chief Engineer holding hands under the table throughout the entire meeting.  Life in the Delta quadrant was indeed good!</p>
<p>After the meeting broke up Seven and B'Elanna parted ways and B'Elanna headed to engineering to say good morning to her beloved warp core.  After ensuring that the ship was not suffering any ill effects from being replaced as number one in her affections, she buried herself in some long overdue paperwork.  </p>
<p>For once she was looking forward to lunch in the messhall as she was certain to see Seven there.  She was terribly disappointed when the lovely blonde failed to appear.  B'Elanna waited as long as she could in good conscience, but eventually had to leave without seeing the object of her affections. As she rode the turbolift back to engineering she contemplated calling Seven over the comm to see if everything was Ok, but decided that if Seven was busy she might not appreciate a call just to 'chat.'</p>
<p>When she got back to engineering she ran a few diagnostics from the console on the main floor, and noticed a slight phase variance in one of the plasma injectors.  She was concentrating so hard on her attempts to isolate the problem that she didn't hear the sound of someone walk up beside her to observe her work.</p>
<p>She was startled, therefore, to see a mesh encased hand enter her field of view, pointing to the console screen, as a familiar patrician voice began to speak, "I believe if you compensate for rate of flow in the coil here, you will be able to overcome the variance."</p>
<p>A familiar flash of anger at the drone's self-confident speech flared and was instantly gone, replaced with her happiness at seeing Seven again.  "Nuh uh Seven, already tried that&amp;#133;no joy." For several minutes they worked in silence, two pairs of hands flying over the console screen, working together on a problem.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna was enjoying the closeness; she could feel the heat radiating off of Seven's body.  Finally, still working, she shifted her weight toward the young drone, bumping their hips together in a playful hipcheck before asking, "So, Seven do you want to do something tonight&amp;#133;Maybe go to Sandrine's or take a walk in the airponics bay?"</p>
<p>Seven smiled to herself as she had come down here with the sole purpose of finding an activity to engage in with B'Elanna this evening.  She had had a plan of her own, but decided that it would wait, and she agreed to meet B'Elanna in the messhall for dinner before going to Sandrine's.  They worked together for several more moments until the phase variance was back in line, an event marked by B'Elanna's triumphant "YES!"  She grinned up at the younger woman and said, "See, I told you we'd make a great team Seven."</p>
<p>Seven's only answer was a raised implant and an indulgent smile.  "I will see you tonight at 1800 B'Elanna." The Chief engineer's eyes never left her gently swaying form as Seven walked out of engineering.  </p>
<p>Having found one problem in the warp core B'Elanna decided that a thorough set of analyses was in order, and she promptly set about running them.  She was engrossed in her work when she heard a sound that was completely out of place in engineering.  She turned quickly in time to see several familiar blue sparkling figures begin to emerge out of thin air, right onto the main floor of engineering.</p>
<p>She was in horror as the transporter beams began to take shape in the form of large green aliens with a type of scaled armour covering their bodies.  Her hand flew to her Comm badge.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Intruder Alert! I need a Security team in Engineering. There are at least&amp;#133;. &amp;gt;</p>
<p>Her words were cut off by a blow to the head delivered from behind. She fell soundlessly to the deck plating.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Just as B'Elanna's words rang out on the bridge, Harry Kim noticed something on his console that had not been there a second ago.  Tuvok was already heading for the turbolift when he stopped at Ensign Kim's words.</p>
<p>"There is a ship 50,000 kilometers off the port bow&amp;#133;it wasn't there a second ago.  They must have some kind of cloaking device."  There was a brief pause as the bridge crew digested his words. "They are powering weapons and preparing to fire."</p>
<p>"Red Alert, All hands to battle stations." The captain's voice came over the comm and all members of Voyager's crew stopped what they were doing and moved to prepare for battle.</p>
<p>"Shields up," Chakotay's voice snapped.</p>
<p>"I, I can't sir, We've been locked out of shield control.  I'm trying to reroute the command subroutines and gain access now." Kim's hands were flying over the console in an attempt to gain back control of the ship.</p>
<p>"Evasive maneuvers Gamma 1 Mr. Paris," the captain spoke again.</p>
<p>"They are firing. Full spread&amp;#133;Direct hit.  We have hull breaches on deck 7, 10, and 16."</p>
<p>"Seal them&amp;#133;. Get us out of here Mr. Paris."</p>
<p>"We don't have Warp engines Captain," Paris groaned as he attempted to maneuver away from the attacking ship.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Bridge to Engineering&amp;gt;</p>
<p>No reply.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Janeway to Torres. &amp;gt;</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>"Mr. Kim, what is the status of Engineering?"</p>
<p>"I don't know Captain, I no longer have access to the controls, and I believe all comms have been cut to that area."</p>
<p>"Keep trying."</p>
<p>"Aye Captain."</p>
<hr/>
<p>Seven's first impulse on hearing the Red Alert called was to go to engineering to ensure that B'Elanna was safe, but her overriding sense of duty wouldn't allow it.  She headed to the bridge and as she exited the turbolift and saw the ship on the viewscreen her heart fell.</p>
<p>"Species 1327, the Hakari.  They are scavengers.  They have cloaking technology stolen from other species as well as disrupter type weapons.  They will attempt to gain access to main engineering and take over the ship from within so as not to damage any valuable systems.  They will not hesitate to kill the crew."  Seven gave her brief dispassionate report as she moved to the secondary Ops station.  Her heart stopped beating as she saw that engineering was already cut off from the rest of the ship. 'B'Elanna!' was all she could think.</p>
<hr/>
<p>B'Elanna's head felt like it was going to split open.  She slowly opened her eyes and without moving glanced at as much of engineering as she could see.  There were several of the aliens in her view&amp;#133;all engaged at the consoles.  With agonizing slowness, she coiled her body and in one swift motion sprang to her feet, grabbing the nearest intruder around the neck.  She twisted with all her strength and felt the satisfying crunch of neck bones breaking.</p>
<p>Still holding the lifeless body she faced the next challenge.  The phaser bolt he fired was absorbed by the body she held like a shield in front of her.  She grabbed the weapon of her victim and fired twice, taking down two more of the aliens.  Dragging the lifeless body she moved backward to a relatively covered area of engineering.  Holding the weapon in one hand she accessed the console to see what damage had been done.</p>
<p>The first thing she tried to do was unlock the doors to engineering, but she quickly realized it would take too long to break the encryption codes that had been placed on them.  'Tuvok will just have to blast his way in she thought,' as she began the job of getting warp speed restored to her ship.</p>
<p>Several phaser bolts fizzled around her and she looked up, firing at the intruders who were attempting to neutralize her.  One of them took a direct hit and felt from the second floor onto the deck with a muffled thud.  She fired several more times to keep the attackers occupied while she went back to work.  She continued working feverishly, returning fire as needed.  She was relieved to hear the sounds of the security team working away at the door.</p>
<p>She had managed to gain back control of the comm system, and shields, but to bring the warp core back online she was going to have to make a run for the main console.  She decided to wait until the doors to engineering were breached so that she would have a better chance of making it in all the confusion.  'Hurry up guys,' she thought to herself as the noise outside increased.</p>
<p>Finally, with a loud blast, and a flash of light the doors were blown open and the security team came pouring in.  'Now or never,' she thought to herself as she ran to the centre of the room, firing as she went.  She accessed the controls and entered the commands, and Voyager was back under the control of the bridge.  She spun around to assist the security team in eradicating the last of the intruders.  She never even saw the phaser bolt as it tore into her chest.</p>
<hr/>
<p>On the bridge Paris was trying his best to minimize damage to the ship by executing every evasive maneuver he could think of.  Even with his skill they had taken several more direct hits.</p>
<p>"Shields are back on line."</p>
<p>"Good job Mr. Kim," the captain commended.</p>
<p>"It wasn't me," Harry replied.</p>
<p>Seven took heart at his words.  There was only one person she knew of who was capable of getting control of engineering back that quickly.  B'Elanna was alright, at least for now.</p>
<p>With shields back in place Tom had a bit more breathing room and for now they were escaping heavy damage.  Everyone knew, however, if they didn't get weapons or warp drive back soon nothing else was going to matter.</p>
<p>There were several reports of intruders throughout the ship and armed security teams were engaged in skirmishes in several locations.  </p>
<p>"Captain the warp engines are back on line."</p>
<p>"Get us out of here Mr. Paris, maximum warp, any course for now."</p>
<p>Voyager blurred into a beam of light and disappeared from the viewscreen of the enemy vessel.  They didn't have the technology to track the ship down, and they had taken heavy losses in this battle.  They turned their ship around and began to search for easier prey.</p>
<p>"Casualty and damage reports are coming in now Captain," Harry spoke up in the silence that ensued their remarkable escape.  "The security teams have all the intruders in custody.  There is heavy damage to engineering.  Weapons are still offline.  We have 25 injured in sickbay right now, and 3 casualties.  Crewman Rhys, Ensign Johnson, and&amp;#133;Oh God no&amp;#133;Lieutenant Torres."</p>
<p>A stunned silence followed Harry's revelation.  The captain covered her face with her hands and fought for control as she thought of the young woman who had come so far since she joined this crew.  Even Tom Paris looked ill.  He was as aware as anyone else on the bridge that only B'Elanna could have restored the warp engines that saved all of their lives.</p>
<p>Seven of Nine was fighting for control.  This could not be happening.  She was holding onto the console with such strength that the Plexan surface cracked under the pressure.  Tears began to stream down her face, and she fell to one knee, no longer able to stand.  Harry was at her side in an instant.  He had seen how close the two had become in the past few weeks.  He managed to put his own grief at the death of his friend aside for a moment as he helped Seven to her feet.</p>
<p>"Come on Seven, you need to get out of here.  Captain, permission to leave the bridge."</p>
<p>The captain, who still had not taken in the enormity of what had happened, didn't speak.  Instead Chakotay gave permission for Seven and Harry to go.</p>
<p>They entered the turbolift and Seven sobbed, "I need to see her, please, take me to her."</p>
<p>Harry tapped his comm badge and inquired of the computer as to the location of Lieutenant Torres. A second later he could have kicked himself as the computer, of course, informed them that Lieutenant Torres was not aboard the ship.  Seven began sobbing anew, and Harry attempted to comfort her as he called sickbay to ask if B'Elanna had been taken there.  They could hear the pandemonium in sickbay over the comm; a medic informed them tersely that B'Elanna was indeed there.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter 7">
<p>Harry continued to support Seven as they walked down the corridor. He stopped her just outside of the doors to sickbay.  "Are you sure you want to do this Seven, maybe it would be better to wait."  He had no idea the kind of shape B'Elanna's body would be in after the battle, and the truth was he was a little afraid he would be in no shape to comfort Seven if things were too gruesome.  After all, B'Elanna had been his friend as well.</p>
<p>"I must see her, please, I need to be with her."</p>
<p>Reluctantly Harry took the young drone's arm and led the way into sickbay.  He was unprepared for what lay on the other side of the doors.  He had never been to sickbay immediately after a major battle like this before.  The injured filled every biobed and the rest sat on the floor leaning against the bulkheads, crude bandages covering wounds until the more serious injuries were dealt with.  The medical staff was moving frantically between beds, and he could hear the sounds of moaning and crying from all over the room.</p>
<p>He pulled Seven to one side so they could be out of the way while they gathered the courage to search for B'Elanna's body.  In the back corner of the room they could see the doctor frantically working over a patient.  Seven's optical implant could detect the faint purple shimmer of a level 10 medical forcefield indicating the doctor was performing surgery of an invasive nature.</p>
<p>There was no sign of B'Elanna's body anywhere in the room.  Finally Harry managed to grab the arm of a medic as he rushed by to gather more bandages.  "We're looking for Lieutenant Torres," he asked quietly.  The medic pulled his arm free and jerked his head toward the back of the sickbay as he hurried back to his task.  Harry wasn't sure exactly what was going on at this point, so he took Seven's hand and they walked slowly toward the bed where the doctor continued to work furiously on his patient.  They could hear his voice snapping out demands for instruments and hyposprays as he operated.</p>
<p>As they drew closer, Seven caught sight of the patient's dark hair.  The doctor demanded a cardiac stimulator and he attempted to shock the heart back into rhythm.  As the body of the patient arched into the air both Seven and Harry could clearly see the familiar brow ridges of the Klingon engineer. Seven grabbed the wall to support herself; she could clearly see that B'Elanna's chest was gaping open, the clean lines of the wound indicating the work of a laser scalpel.  A tube was running out of her mouth to a machine that was regulating her breathing, and the sheet covering her body was soaked in blood.</p>
<p>Harry took Seven's hand and tried to lead her away saying, "Seven, maybe we should wait somewhere else, why don't we go into the doctor's office and get out of the way."</p>
<p>"NO," Seven snarled and refused to be moved from her spot by the wall.</p>
<p>It was over an hour later when the doctor walked through the forcefield and began to clean himself up in preparation for treating other patients.</p>
<p>Seven approached him cautiously.  "Doctor, is she&amp;#133;will she be all right?" </p>
<p>"The next few hours will tell for sure, but I would go on record as saying that I'm cautiously optimistic."</p>
<p>"What happened Doc," Harry inquired?  "I mean, the computer said she was, you know, gone."</p>
<p>"You mean dead?  Well, maybe for a moment or two before her redundant organs kicked in.  She sustained a severe phaser wound to the chest; it would have killed a human instantly.  One of her hearts was damaged but I managed to repair it, as well as the third degree burns covering her chest.  She did lose a portion of her lung, however, lucky for her she has a third one in reserve. I'm hoping she will be her 'charming' self again in a matter of weeks," the EMH answered before moving on to help the next patient.</p>
<p>They moved back to the forcefield to watch B'Elanna sleeping for a moment.  Harry nudged Seven and pointed to a melted comm badge lying on the floor under the biobed.  "No wonder the computer reported her as a casualty, once the comm badge was fried her life signs wouldn't register with the computer and she'd be reported as dead."  He put his arm around the still trembling drone. "Are you sure you don't want to wait somewhere else. There really isn't anything we can do here for now."</p>
<p>Seven shook her head vehemently, "I need to be with her, if she wakes up she may need me."</p>
<p>Harry knew that B'Elanna would not be waking up any time soon, but he also knew when he was fighting a losing battle.  "Will you be Ok here by yourself for a little while," he inquired gently?</p>
<p>Seven nodded, never taking her eyes of the still figure of B'Elanna.</p>
<p>"Just, take it easy ok, I'll be back soon." Harry left to give the good news to the bridge crew in person.</p>
<p>B'Elanna remained unconscious and behind the medical forcefield for several more days.  Slowly the other injured recovered and resumed their duties until only the still body of the young engineer remained.  Seven only left sickbay when she was ordered to sleep or regenerate, or when she was overseeing the repairs to engineering. She ran astrometrics from the consoles in sickbay. If anyone had missed the change in the nature of the relationship between the two former adversaries, the cat was well and truly out of the bag now.  Seven was surprised at the number of crewmembers who stopped by sickbay to sit with her or bring her something to eat.  Naomi Wildman made it a point to stop by with a Kadis Kot board every day after school, and Neelix seemed to appear every few hours or so to fuss after Seven to take care of herself.</p>
<p>When the doctor allowed the forcefield to be dropped, Seven sat with B'Elanna holding her hand for hours, and several times had to be evicted at night to go and regenerate when she was found sleeping sitting in a chair with her head resting on the biobed.  Finally the breathing tube was removed and B'Elanna showed some signs of regaining consciousness.  The doctor was now certain that he and his extraordinary skills had once more performed a miracle.  He never tired of informing B'Elanna's visitors of that fact.</p>
<hr/>
<p>B'Elanna could hear muffled sounds, but she couldn't identify what they were.  She slowly opened her eyes, but everything was out of focus.  She blinked several times, squinting her eyes to try to focus on her surroundings, finally the worried features, and tear-filled eyes of Seven of Nine swam into view.</p>
<p>"Beloved," B'Elanna's voice was hoarse from the breathing tube. She felt Seven's tears as they fell on her face.</p>
<p>"I am here B'Elanna. Do not worry, everything is going to be all right now.  Try to sleep my darling. I will not leave your side." Seven's tear-soaked voice was the most wonderful thing B'Elanna had ever heard in her life.  She felt Seven's hand gently stroking her cheek, and she let her head fall into the contact even as she drifted back to sleep.</p>
<p>"Seven?" B'Elanna awoke disoriented.</p>
<p>"She's not here just now, but I assure you she will be back shortly," came the clipped tones of the Doctor.  He stepped over to the bed and began his scans of the patient.  "I see you are recovering nicely."</p>
<p>"What happened, why am I here?"</p>
<p>"You don't remember the fight in engineering."</p>
<p>"Fight, with who," B'Elanna was getting agitated.</p>
<p>"Calm down or I'll have to give you a sedative.  We were attacked and you were injured in a fire fight in engineering."</p>
<p>"When?"</p>
<p>"Almost two weeks ago now."</p>
<p>"Two weeks," B'Elanna yelped "I've got to get to engineering," she struggled to get off the bed.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Torres, if you don't lie back down immediately I will be forced to sedate you," the Doctor ordered!  "Besides your engines are in capable hands."</p>
<p>"Whose capable hands," B'Elanna ground out.</p>
<p>"Seven of Nine is overseeing all the repairs, so please try to calm down."</p>
<p>"Oh Kahless, my engine room will never be the same," B'Elanna sank back down on the bed in defeat.</p>
<p>She had several more visitors in quick succession, as the Doctor announced to the bridge that B'Elanna was feeling better.  Captain Janeway popped in to check up on her Chief Engineer, and they chatted for several minutes until Harry popped his head in the door; the captain excused herself, promising to be back soon.</p>
<p>"So, Maquis, I see you're slacking off again," he teased, producing a small bouquet of flowers and setting on the console near her bed.</p>
<p>"If you really want to impress me Starfleet you'll smuggle me a PADD so I can see what the heck in going on in Engineering after all this time," B'Elanna grumbled.</p>
<p>"I'm shocked, you mean to tell me don't trust Seven alone in your engine room even after all this time." </p>
<p>"Come on Harry, what's going on down there, I need to know," B'Elanna pleaded.</p>
<p>"What is going on down where, exactly," came a familiar voice from the doorway?</p>
<p>"Oh Maquis, you are so busted," Harry laughed as he began to slink to the door in an over-exaggerated fashion that had B'Elanna laughing.</p>
<p>"Trying to check up on me were you Lieutenant Torres," Seven intoned with a severe look on her face as Harry exited the door behind her with a wave to B'Elanna.</p>
<p>"I need to know what's going on in my engine room Seven, there was a lot of damage, and some of the repairs could be delicate.  I should take a look at what's been done and see where we stand."</p>
<p>"Where we stand is that you are recovering from a serious accident, and are in no shape to be worrying about ships repairs.  You can trust that I am being most&amp;#133;efficient&amp;#133;in undertaking repairs."</p>
<p>B'Elanna groaned at hearing the Borg's favourite word.  "Just tell me a little bit about what's going on and I'll stop worrying, I promise," she wheedled.</p>
<p>"Persistence is futile B'Elanna Torres."</p>
<p>B'Elanna slumped back down on the biobed fully prepared to sulk when Seven spoke again softly.</p>
<p>"Are you not happy to see me?"</p>
<p>B'Elanna, realizing that this was the first time she had really been awake to talk to Seven since the accident, was instantly remorseful.  </p>
<p>"Seven, sweetie, of course I'm happy to see you.  I'm sorry, you know how nuts I get when I'm stuck in sickbay.  Come here, I'm really sorry," she held out her hand and Seven moved swiftly to take it.</p>
<p>They sat quietly holding hands for a few moments, and then B'Elanna tugged gently, pulling Seven to her to give her a soft kiss.  The doctor, who had been watching the exchange between the two women, suddenly had an urge to do something somewhere else, anywhere else, and he left in a hurry.</p>
<p>B'Elanna giggled upon seeing the Doctor's less than dignified exit.  "I guess we scared him off huh?"</p>
<p>A worried look crossed Seven's face, "he is the biggest gossip aboard this ship, are you not worried that he will tell everyone about what he saw."</p>
<p>"I don't care who he tells beloved, I don't plan on keeping this a secret&amp;#133;do you?" B'Elanna was suddenly unsure of exactly how Seven saw the relationship.</p>
<p>"I do not want you to be ostracized over our relationship.  I worry that the other crewmembers will not accept your relationship with a Borg." Seven was aware that people had been very friendly since B'Elanna's accident, but she didn't trust that this wouldn't change once people realized that they were more than just friends.  She was too inexperienced to know that her actions over the past few weeks were more efficient than a comm announcement in explaining the extent of their feelings for one another.</p>
<p>"You are a former Borg, I don't think people will have a problem with it, and I don't care if they do.  I'm happy with you, and I'm hoping you're happy with me.  That's all that matters."  B'Elanna was exhausted after this outburst, and she lay back down, her forehead covered in a sheen of sweat.</p>
<p>Seven soothed B'Elanna, wiping her forehead and kissing her ridges gently.  "I have never been happier B'Elanna."</p>
<p>"Well that settles it then, let the Doctor tell the world."  </p>
<p>"B'Elanna," Seven's voice was quiet.</p>
<p>"Mmhmm."</p>
<p>"What does this word you call me 'beloved' mean?  I thought it was an adjective."</p>
<p>B'Elanna laughed at the young woman's literal translation.  "Well, it is I guess, but it means that you are my beloved, that you are beloved of me.  I don't think pet names are supposed to make grammatical sense."  She paused for a moment; "It's also the title of an ancient Earth book.  I was reading it before the accident and I guess it stuck in my mind.  It's a book about how the past is a living thing, and if you aren't careful it can catch up with you no matter how hard you run. I guess it sort of applies to both of us."</p>
<p>"I would like to read this book."</p>
<p>"Tell you what, why don't we read it together when I get out of here?"</p>
<p>"That would be nice, my beloved," Seven said as she continued to caress B'Elanna's ridges.  </p>
<p>The doors to sickbay opened and Neelix came in with a food-laden tray.  "Alright, its time for the patient AND the visitor to eat," he announced.  He proceeded to spread out several different types of food, assuring both Seven and B'Elanna that everything was exceedingly bland.  He was about to leave, when B'Elanna insisted he stay and eat with them.  It took almost no persuasion and soon he was making them both laugh with his tales from the messhall.  They talked for several hours until the doctor chased both Neelix and Seven out saying that his patient needed her rest.  Neelix was gratified to see the tender kiss that Seven and B'Elanna shared before the Doctor ushered them out the door.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter 8">
<p>B'Elanna was losing her mind being trapped in sickbay.  She had been feeling better for a week now, but the doctor refused to let her go.  He kept running scans and fussing about 'opportunistic infections' were she to leave the relatively sterile environment in sickbay.  He was also positive that the second she hit the door she would head straight to engineering and work herself to death.  He had delayed the inevitable for as long he could, but frankly, having an irritating Klingon with too much time on her hands was beginning to wear on his holographic nerves.  This morning when he materialized to find himself wearing a frilly white apron it was the last straw.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Torres, return my programming to its original state this instant," he snapped.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was laughing herself silly in the corner of sickbay, but she quickly undid her minor 'modification' of the doctor's holomatrix.  She was feeling better and could conceive of no real reason why she couldn't return to work.  The only thing that made life bearable were the regular visits of Seven of Nine.  Even that was a bit worrisome however, as Seven refused to discuss the repairs in engineering or any other part of the ship for that matter.  When B'Elanna had attempted to gain access to the engineering computer to do a little 'reconnaissance' she had found herself locked out with a Borg encryption code protecting the files.</p>
<p>Seven had left last night promising to return after her duty shift at 1900 hours.  B'Elanna still found the young drone's literal nature to be fascinating.  She amused herself by watching the seconds of the ship's chronometer count up to 1900.  Precisely as the chronometer turned over from 1859 to 1900 the doors to sickbay opened with a whoosh and the beautiful figure of Seven of Nine entered the room. </p>
<p>Seven cocked an implant at the site of B'Elanna, clad only in her hospital gown giggling like a child at the sickbay console.  "What is it that you find so amusing Lieutenant Torres," she droned?</p>
<p>"Oh, Lieutenant Torres is finding everything amusing today Seven," the Doctor interrupted.  "In fact since she seems well enough to be 'rearranging' my program I've decided to let her go <A HREF="http://home.\\rdblquote" TARGET="_top">home.</A></p>
<p>B'Elanna was halfway to the door when the Doctor called out, "on one condition Lieutenant."</p>
<p>The young Klingon turned slowly around, "what," she asked cautiously.</p>
<p>"You are to remain in your quarters for at least five days.  I don't want you out and interacting with the crew until I've checked you out one last time.  I am placing you in Seven's care.  I trust her to be able to keep you under control for five days," he finished sternly.</p>
<p>"Ok, fine, no problem, come on Seven lets get out of here," B'Elanna was headed for the door again.</p>
<p>"I'm serious.  Seven, make sure she does no work, that she eats properly, and that she doesn't have visitors or leave her quarters.  I'm holding you responsible for this. I also want you to check with me every day before you visit B'Elanna so I can run scans to ensure you aren't carrying anything back with you."</p>
<p>"I will see that she complies," Seven stated emphatically and turned to escort B'Elanna from the room.</p>
<p>"Wait, I want you to use a site to site transport, I meant what I said, she is not to be exposed to the rest of the crew."  Seven and B'Elanna waited patiently until the familiar pull of the transporter beam moved them to the living room of B'Elanna's quarters.</p>
<p>"Alright!  Freedom," B'Elanna was positively giddy as found herself back in her own room.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna, I meant what I said to the Doctor, I intend to see to it that you follow his instructions to the letter." Seven's voice was stern.</p>
<p>"Oh, come on Seven, he was just being overprotective.  There's no reason I can't just slip out to engineering for a few minutes, or go for a walk."</p>
<p>Seven sighed as she realized the enormity of her task.  "I would have thought you would rather spend this time with me than with your engines," Seven's pout was only partially acting.</p>
<p>B'Elanna had the good grace to look abashed as she realized she had caused Seven to feel that she took second place to engineering for the second time in their short relationship.  "Kahless, I keep doing this Seven.  I'm sorry.  I do want to spend the time with you.  I'm thrilled to be home, and have you all to myself, and I'm grateful that you agreed to help out or the Doc never would've let me out of sickbay."  </p>
<p>Seven smiled shyly, her doubts relieved by the vehemence of B'Elanna's words, "then I believe the least you could do would be to kiss me."</p>
<p>B'Elanna didn't need to be asked twice.  She swept Seven into her arms and took her breath away with the passion of her kiss.</p>
<p>When they finally broke apart Seven shooed B'Elanna into the shower and began to prepare dinner for them both.</p>
<p>Seven looked up from her dinner preparations as B'Elanna came into the room.  She was clad in her old sweats and looked thin and very young, her heart constricted to see her love looking so fragile.  She was more determined than ever to see that B'Elanna followed the Doctor's orders to the letter.</p>
<p>"Smells great Seven, I didn't realize that you were such a cook," B'Elanna remarked as she made her way to the couch to rest before dinner.  </p>
<p>"Mr. Neelix has been giving me lessons," Seven stated.  "Do not worry, we have agreed to disagree on the matter of proper spicing procedures," she added upon seeing the worried look on B'Elanna's face.</p>
<p>B'Elanna sat in silence watching Seven finish making the meal.  "Do you know you always stick the tip of your mouth out when you're concentrating on slicing or stirring something?"</p>
<p>Seven blushed, "I was unaware."</p>
<p>"Hey, don't be embarrassed, I think it is the most adorable thing I've ever seen," B'Elanna hastened to reassure her.  This caused Seven's blush to deepen considerably, as she carried the plates to the table.</p>
<p>After the meal was finished and cleared away, B'Elanna took Seven by the hand and led her to the couch.  She sat down and pulled the younger woman into her arms, holding her tightly.  "There's something we need to talk about&amp;#133;something I need to tell you Seven." She could feel Seven's body stiffen and try to pull away at her words.  The worry was evident in the young Borg's eyes.  "No, no, Seven, nothing bad I promise.  Its just something I have been thinking about ever since I woke up in sickbay and I don't want to wait any longer."  B'Elanna fervently hoped she was doing the right thing.  "Seven, I nearly died in that fire fight, and it really made me see that life is short.  We're out here in this dangerous, unfamiliar place and anything can happen.  I almost died before I could really tell you what you mean to me, so I don't want to wait any longer before I do.  I, Seven of Nine, I love you. I love you with all my heart&amp;#133;I know this seems fast, we really just found each other, but I don't want to hold anything back anymore."</p>
<p>Tears were running down Seven's cheeks and B'Elanna was worried that she had upset the young woman, and terrified that her feelings weren't returned.</p>
<p>"Seven, please say something," B'Elanna begged.</p>
<p>"I am afraid," Seven's words were barely audible.</p>
<p>"Afraid of what Seven?"</p>
<p>"Afraid of losing you, afraid that you will change your mind once you have spent more time with me. Afraid that you will find out that a drone can never love you back the way you deserve.  I am afraid of how much I love you."  Seven's look bore into B'Elanna.  "I do love you B'Elanna Torres."</p>
<p>Relieved at finally hearing the words, B'Elanna pulled Seven back into her arms.  "I am never going to stop loving you Seven.  You are everything I've ever dreamed of, and I will always love you."  </p>
<p>Seven buried her head in B'Elanna's shoulder and allowed herself to be comforted as if she were a child.  Finally she spoke.  "I believe that I am also feeling guilty."</p>
<p>"Guilty about what?"</p>
<p>There was a long silence as Seven tried to put what she was feeling into words.</p>
<p>"As a part of the Borg I was guilty of terrible crimes.  I stole the lives of so many people, destroyed so many worlds.  I have never been punished for these crimes.  Once I was severed from the collective and began my life on Voyager I tried to atone for these crimes by helping out the people on this ship.  I have never stopped regretting my actions as a Borg.  I learned to despise the collective and everything they stood for. I remained alone and separate on Voyager, the rest of the crew still sees me as Borg, and I allowed that to become a part of my penance.  As long as I was feeling alone and guilty I could believe I was somehow being brought to justice in some small way for my crimes.  But now I am not alone, and I am happy.  I cannot reconcile my happiness in the present with my actions in the past.  How can I hate the Borg when they brought me to you."</p>
<p>"Seven, sweetie, you can't help what you did when you were a part of the collective, you had no control.  As to being punished, I think losing almost 20 years of your life, your entire childhood, your teenage years, I think that's punishment enough.  No one expects you to atone for your crimes by being lonely for the rest of your life.  The best you can do is accept what happened in the past, and embrace what is happening now.  You have saved Voyager on more than one occasion using knowledge that you gained from the Borg.  Maybe that's how you can honour those people who were assimilated, to use their knowledge to help others.  As to being glad that the Borg brought us together, in some small way I guess I've been feeling the same conflict.  I feel terrible about everything that happened to you, but it made you the person you are, the person I love, so maybe I owe a debt of gratitude to the Borg as well.  I do know we don't need to figure this all out tonight."  B'Elanna was emotionally drained by her outburst and allowed her head to rest on Seven's as they wept together for everything they had lost, and all that they had gained.</p>
<p>Much later, noticing that B'Elanna had drifted off, Seven gathered B'Elanna into her arms and effortlessly carried her into the bedroom. B'Elanna woke as Seven was tucking the blankets around her.  "Stay with me Seven," she murmured as she held onto the younger woman's hand.  Seven acquiesced and changed into the sleepwear B'Elanna had leant her previously.  She crawled into bed and wrapped her arms around the engineer, kissing her gently before they fell asleep.</p>
<p>B'Elanna woke the next morning, feeling the bed move as Seven got up to get ready for work. She heard the sonic shower activate and dozed back off, only awakening again at the feel of someone kissing her.  She responded to the kiss, pulling Seven back into the bed with her, letting her hands roam over the young drone's back.  She loved the feel of Seven's body lying over hers, and she arched up into the contact, hearing Seven moan as their bodies pressed closely together.  </p>
<p>It took all of Seven's considerable willpower to pull herself away from B'Elanna's embrace.  "We have to stop," she whimpered.  "You must eat breakfast and I must get to work."</p>
<p>"If we skip breakfast we can keep doing this," B'Elanna pleaded.</p>
<p>"Nno, you need to eat, Doctor's orders," Seven stated firmly levering herself up off the bed.  She smiled indulgently at B'Elanna's pout before turning to walk out of the bedroom.</p>
<p>B'Elanna followed a little while later, only slightly cheered at the sight of her favourite breakfast prepared on the table.</p>
<p>"So what are you working on today," B'Elanna asked nonchalantly?</p>
<p>Seven was not fooled by the engineer's feigned indifference.  "I have several scans to complete of nearby sectors."</p>
<p>"Sounds interesting," she fibbed, "what about engineering?"</p>
<p>"That, my dear, is not your concern for 5 more days."</p>
<p>B'Elanna knew when she was beaten.</p>
<p>After they tidied away the dishes B'Elanna walked Seven to the door of her quarters.  She wrapped her arms around her and kissed her joking, "have a nice day honey."</p>
<p>Seven put her hands on either side of B'Elanna's face, looking deeply into her eyes. "I want you to promise me that you will follow the Doctor's orders today and simply rest.  I almost lost you once, I do not wish feel that pain again."</p>
<p>B'Elanna promised to be good and was rewarded with a passionate kiss and a promise that Seven would be back at lunch.</p>
<p>B'Elanna prowled around her quarters like a caged Targ.  She smiled to herself when she noticed that Seven had cleared all the PADDs and tools from her console.  She hefted her Bat'leth thinking she might use the time to practice, but she tired quickly and decided to take a nap. She awoke to the sound of her door as Seven entered carrying two trays from the messhall.</p>
<p>"Wow, I guess I really drifted off there."</p>
<p>"I am glad to see that you are taking the Doctor's orders so seriously," Seven smiled.</p>
<p>"This has nothing to do with the Doctor, I promised you I'd be good, so that's that."</p>
<p>"A very mature attitude."</p>
<p>B'Elanna couldn't think of an answer to that so had to settle for sticking her tongue out.</p>
<p>Seven stayed until she was certain that B'Elanna had consumed sufficient food, and then she went back to work.  </p>
<p>B'Elanna was once again alone with little to do.  She listened to some music, took a shower, and flopped back on the couch.  She curled up, thinking about the past weeks and everything that Seven had come to mean to her.  The truth was she was terrified at the depths of her feelings for the young woman.  B'Elanna had learned early in life never to want too much.  She had always been careful to have very small dreams, that way she ensured she would only suffer very small disappointments.  She knew that if you didn't want things, and tried not to care too much about them if you had them, then you wouldn't be devastated when you inevitably lost them.  Now here she was involved in something that had the power to tear her very soul apart, and destroy her heart should something go wrong. She had never wanted anything this much since a very young half-Klingon had begged Kahless nightly to send her father back to her.</p>
<p>She was interrupted from her morose thoughts when her comm badge activated with a beep.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Seven of Nine to Torres&amp;gt;</p>
<p>She leaned over to the coffee table to tap her badge.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Torres here&amp;gt;</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Is everything all right&amp;gt;</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Sure Seven, I'm fine, why? &amp;gt;</p>
<p>&amp;lt;I, I am, uncertain.  I suppose I was just concerned. &amp;gt;</p>
<p>&amp;lt;I'm fine sweetie, better still now that I've heard your voice. &amp;gt;</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Very well, but please try to stay out of trouble.  I will know if you misbehave. &amp;gt;  Seven used her best Borg voice, her stern demeanor only betrayed by her laughter after she spoke.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;I love you too Seven, Torres out. &amp;gt;</p>
<p>B'Elanna was in a decidedly better mood after Seven's call, and she began to think about their relationship and where it was heading.  She knew she wanted to wait to make love to Seven until the timing was perfect. Seven's first time should be perfect.  She thought about the various holoprograms other couples aboard the ship had used, and went so far as to scan through a listing of several of them.  None of them seemed quite right however. She fell into thought and suddenly a smile spread over her face. This was going to be perfect.  It was also going to be a lot of work, much of which she could accomplish right from her console.  Finally happy to have found something to occupy her time, she set to work.</p>
<p>She was still hunched over her console happily working when Seven returned after her duty shift ended. </p>
<p>"I thought you promised to follow the Doctor's orders and rest," she stated severely upon seeing B'Elanna at her workstation.</p>
<p>"I'm not working, I promise."</p>
<p>Seven walked over and saw the program open on the console.  "You are designing a holoprogram?" She was a little surprised, as B'Elanna had never evinced an interest in such things before.  "What are you programming."</p>
<p>"It's a surprise sweetie.  I promise not to overdo Ok."</p>
<p>"Very well, since you promise," she paused before smiling sweetly, "now put your toys away and come and eat."</p>
<p>B'Elanna happily saved her work and went to have dinner with the most beautiful woman she had ever known.</p>
<p>After dinner B'Elanna led Seven to the sofa and produced the PADD that contained the ancient, earth novel <u>Beloved</u>. Seven sat down with her back braced against the arm of the sofa and her feet up.  B'Elanna positioned herself between Seven's legs, leaning back against her for support.  The young drone wrapped her arms around her engineer, holding her closely as they began to read the novel together.  Seven was moved by the story of the young mother who was so haunted by the past, and she understood why B'Elanna felt the story applied to both of them. </p>
<p>The five days passed quickly in this manner.  After the first night Seven no longer slept with B'Elanna, but she was there for every meal, and she grew to love the feeling of taking care of her beloved.  They spent some time each night reading the novel and talking about what they had read.  Seven could not imagine a feeling of greater contentment than holding her lover in her arms each night as they read.  She tucked B'Elanna into bed before she left, a task which seemed to take a little longer every night, and then returned to her alcove to regenerate. Unbeknownst to B'Elanna, at least once each night Seven interrupted her regeneration cycle for an hour or so and made her way back to the young Klingon's quarters to watch over her as she slept.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The morning of the sixth day B'Elanna was up early.  She showered and put on her uniform for the first time in almost a month.  It felt good.  She was already out in the living room when Seven came in for their usual breakfast together.  While happy that B'Elanna was well again, she was going to miss looking after the young engineer, and she knew that she might not see as much of her now that she was sure to throw herself back into her work with a vengeance. There was a small secret part of her heart that was also worried that once B'Elanna could chose from anyone on the ship to spend time with she might no longer wish to be with Seven.  Still, she should be happy for her friend, so she forced a wide smile onto her face and entered the room trying to project the image of someone without a care in the world.</p>
<p>"I see you are up already, you must be truly anxious about the possibility of Borg enhancements in your engine room," Seven joked.</p>
<p>Wordlessly B'Elanna crossed the room and threw her arms around Seven.  "Sweetie, don't worry, nothing is going to change between us just because I'm allowed to leave my quarters.  I love you Seven, only you," she stated emphatically.</p>
<p>Taken aback Seven could only mumble, "how could you know?"</p>
<p>"Because I love you.  You think I don't the difference between a real smile and a 'my heart's breaking but I'm Borg so nobody will notice' smile.  Please try not to worry Ok.  I promise, everything is going to be fine."</p>
<p>"I love you B'Elanna Torres."</p>
<p>"I know," B'Elanna smiled wicked, "but don't think that's going to save your cute little behind if I find even a single Borg enhancement to my engines," the young Klingon teased before kissing Seven on the tip of her nose.  "Let's eat."</p>
<p>As they cleared the dishes away B'Elanna enthused about the day ahead. "I can't wait to get back to work.  The first thing I'm going to do is run a diagnostic on the plasma injectors, the engines have sounded a little different the last couple of days, maybe they need realigning." Her ability to detect problems with the engines just from the feel of the deck plates vibrating was legendary aboard Voyager.</p>
<p>Seven smiled at the young engineer's enthusiasm, but interrupted nonetheless. "The first thing you are going to do is report to sickbay for your checkup."</p>
<p>"Oh, come on, that can wait.  Tell you what, I'll stop by engineering and start the diagnostics and then swing by sickbay."</p>
<p>Seven crossed her arms and tapped her foot, the perfect picture of indulgent irritation.  She raised her ocular implant to its highest level, "the first thing you are going to do is what?"</p>
<p>"Go to sickbay for my checkup."  B'Elanna knew when she was beaten.</p>
<p>Seven insisted on a site to site transport to sickbay just in case the Doctor found anything wrong.  She needn't have worried however as the EMH ran a series of tests and pronounced B'Elanna fit to return to duty immediately.  B'Elanna thanked the Doctor effusively and turned to Seven.  She looked up into the face that had become so dear to her, and even as the Doctor was reiterating how brilliant his cure had been B'Elanna spoke, "Computer deactivate the EMH."</p>
<p>"B'Elanna what are you doing, that was terribly rude."</p>
<p>"I'll apologize later," B'Elanna said as she pulled Seven's head down to capture her lips. Seven responded instantly, clutching B'Elanna's uniform jacket and pulling her close.  The kiss deepened as tongues tangled and hands explored.   </p>
<p>The EMH shimmered back into view with a angry remark about B'Elanna's gratitude, or lack thereof, but when he caught site of the scene in front of him he merely rolled his eye and heaved a theatrical sigh saying, "Computer deactivate EMH."</p>
<p>Seven had undone B'Elanna's tunic and she was untucking her tank top, frantically seeking access to the engineer's wonderful caramel skin, moaning as finally managed to touch the Klingon's warm back.  B'Elanna let her hands run down Seven's back until she grasped the younger woman's perfectly shaped behind in her hands, gently kneading as she pulled Seven closer still.  'Kahless I want this woman in my bed,' she thought to herself even as she knew that they needed to stop right now. She slid her hands up to Seven's face, enjoying every inch of their sensuous journey up the young Borg's back and shoulders, caressing her cheeks even as she gently tried to disengage from the embrace.  She almost lost her resolve when she felt Seven nip at her lower lip, but she managed to soothe the heated embrace into a gentle hug as the two of them fought for control over hammering hearts and panting breaths. </p>
<p>Finally able to trust herself to move, B'Elanna looked up at Seven.  The young Borg's face was flushed and her hair was disheveled as her stormy blue eyes locked with B'Elanna's.  She smiled shakily, a little surprised at how easily she felt out of control around this enchanting creature.  Seven returned her smile before lowering her head so their foreheads were touching.  They stayed that way for several moments, each taking strength from the other.</p>
<p>Seven was the first to straighten up, "I suppose we should return to our duties," her voice was less certain than she had intended.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I guess we really should."  There was a moment of quiet before B'Elanna inquired, "do you want to meet for lunch in the messhall, say around 1300."</p>
<p>"Acceptable," said Seven as her legendary Borg control snapped back into place.</p>
<p>B'Elanna finished straightening up her clothes, quickly kissing Seven once more before they headed down to engineering.</p>
<p>B'Elanna began running her diagnostics of the plasma injectors before she greeted her crew, all of whom were ecstatic to see her.  They hadn't really minded working for Seven of Nine, but they all felt just a little more relaxed now that the Chief was back. She endured the good-natured ribbing about her slacking off and the happy greetings for several moments before she grabbed Seven and demanded a full report of the repairs and upgrades completed since the encounter with the Hakari.</p>
<p>It was lunchtime before they were done going over all of the information regarding repairs so they walked to the messhall together.  B'Elanna had to fight her urges to grab Seven's hand and hold it the whole way there.  Neelix was vibrating with excitement at the sight of B'Elanna back in her uniform and back in his messhall.  He grandly ushered them to a table and told them he would be right back with their lunches.  B'Elanna was a little skeptical about letting him choose her meal for her but he seemed so happy that she couldn't bring herself to say to no.</p>
<p>"Here you are, my own special recipe, Leola Root Casserole," he said with a flourish as he set two plates of vaguely yellowish goo before them.</p>
<p>"Erm, thanks Neelix."</p>
<p>It was obvious he wasn't going to go away without getting a reaction to his selection, so B'Elanna picked up her fork and took a mouthful.  It was definitely not as spicy as the Talaxian's cooking usually was, which was good, but the problem was it didn't have much taste at all.  Still, sometimes that could be a blessing with Neelix's cooking.</p>
<p>"Thanks Neelix, it's great," she smiled widely at a gratified chef.</p>
<p>"Wonderful, well, enjoy your meal," he said as he scurried back behind the counter.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was besieged by well wishers as she ate.  It seems as if everyone who came into the messhall had to come over and comment on how good it was to see her back in action.  She took it well considering she really just wanted to be alone with Seven. Even Tom Paris came up to them, having the good grace to look extremely uncomfortable, and told her he was glad to see that she was feeling better.  The truth was there wasn't a soul on board Voyager who didn't feel safer knowing the B'Elanna was back in charge of the engine room.</p>
<p>Lunch flew by all to quickly and they soon headed back to work.  Since she was finished briefing B'Elanna on the engines Seven was returning to Astrometrics.  They got into the turbolift and announced their separate decks.  The doors slid closed and Seven turned quickly spinning B'Elanna into her arms and kissing her passionately.  "I will miss you this afternoon B'Elanna Torres," she stated when they broke apart.</p>
<p>B'Elanna could only manage a nod and a slightly dazed look.  </p>
<p>The rest of the afternoon flew by as B'Elanna got reacquainted with her engines and her crew.</p>
<p>Sadly for Seven the same did not hold true for her.  She had become used to the controlled chaos of engineering, and the utter calm of Astrometrics seemed a little, dull, this afternoon.  She also missed B'Elanna terribly, but could come up with no good reason to visit the engine room.  She checked the time for the 52<sup>nd</sup> time that afternoon and tried to refocus her energy on her scans.</p>
<hr/>
<p>&amp;lt;Torres to Kim&amp;gt;</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Kim here&amp;gt;</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Can you meet me in the messhall after your shift&amp;gt;</p>
<p>&amp;lt;No problem, see you there&amp;gt;</p>
<p>B'Elanna had done as much as she could on her little project, and now needed some help.  Tom Paris was the acknowledged king of holoprogramming, but there was no way in the galaxy that she was going to ask him.  Harry was almost as good and she could trust him to be happy for her, and, more importantly, to keep his mouth shut.</p>
<p>She showed him the PADD containing her work and he perused it with interest.  B'Elanna was waiting until Seven to showed up so that they could eat together so she fetched Harry's food for him while he went over what she had done so far.</p>
<p>"It looks good," he said, "and I mean the program not the food," as he eyed the unidentified meal on the tray B'Elanna brought back for him.  "I think I can help.  Tell me what you want."  B'Elanna leaned forward enthusiastically as she explained her ideas. </p>
<p>Seven came through the doors to the messhall and scanned for B'Elanna.  She felt a twinge of something when she saw B'Elanna and Harry with their heads together pouring over a PADD.  She forced herself to step into the food line as she analyzed her feelings.  She was ashamed to admit that she was jealous of Harry.  Having received her food, Seven was now at a loss as to what to do.  She desperately wanted to go sit with B'Elanna but was afraid that she might be intruding.  She stood in the middle of the messhall with her tray in her hands.  She was about to go and sit elsewhere when B'Elanna looked up and saw her.  Seven was relieved at the smile that crossed the engineer's face as she waved her over, but felt that familiar twinge as she saw the young Klingon hide the PADD that they had been working on.</p>
<p>She sat with them and they immediately began talking about ship's business and then Harry began catching B'Elanna up on all of the gossip she had missed during her enforced isolation. Seven picked at her food, for some reason she was no longer hungry.  When the meal was over they all got up to leave and Harry invited them to go to Sandrine's that evening.  B'Elanna had been about to accept when Seven made a point of declining the invitation.  B'Elanna shrugged and said that maybe they'd be there another night.  When they got onto the turbolift B'Elanna ordered it to Deck 9.  She was a little shocked when Seven spoke up, ordering the lift to Deck 2.</p>
<p>"You aren't coming back to my quarters," she asked, her confusion evident?</p>
<p>"I was unaware that I was invited."</p>
<p>"Seven, you're always invited."</p>
<p>Seven made no comment but ordered the computer to ignore her deck request.  They walked in an awkward silence to B'Elanna's quarters.</p>
<p>Once inside B'Elanna removed her uniform jacket and ordered a glass of wine from the replicator.  Seven declined her offer of a drink and stood rather awkwardly in the middle of the room.  B'Elanna crossed to the couch.  She sat down and patted the seat beside her, "aren't you going to sit down Seven?"  The younger woman sat rigidly beside her and continued to say nothing. B'Elanna put her arm around the young drone's shoulder and pulled her closer.  She felt Seven relax slightly, and lean into her embrace.  She was about to ask what the problem was when Seven cupped her chin in hand and kissed her.  The question flew out of B'Elanna's mind as she returned the kiss with a passion.</p>
<p>They gently sank down on the sofa, until Seven was lying on top of B'Elanna.  She could feel the ache of need in the pit of her stomach as she moved from kissing her mouth to ravishing her neck with kisses and bites.  B'Elanna's head was swimming as Seven consumed her neck with an almost visceral hunger.  B'Elanna reached up and freed Seven's hair, sliding her hands into it and glorying in the feel of the golden tresses.  She felt Seven's hand pull her top free from her pants and gasped as skin met skin. Seven returned to B'Elanna's mouth as her tongue began to plunder the young engineer's mouth.  She gloried in the growl that seemed to be ripped from B'Elanna's core.  She slid her knee between B'Elanna's legs and pressed down on the raging heat of the Klingon's centre.  B'Elanna was moaning now as her hands desperately tried to find access to Seven's skin through the biosuit.  She felt Seven's hand slide up her belly and cup her breast, beginning to squeeze her nipple through the thin fabric of her bra. Her mouth replaced her hand as she nuzzled B'Elanna's breast through the fabric of her top, her hand, now free slid down to tug at the zipper to B'Elanna's pants. As turned on as she was B'Elanna knew they had to stop, this wasn't right, it was too soon for both of them.  </p>
<p>She pulled back from Seven's sensual assault, moaning, "Seven, sweetheart, we, ahh, we need to stop."</p>
<p>Seven said nothing but tried to recapture B'Elanna' s lips with her own as her hands returned to the young Klingon's breasts.</p>
<p>B'Elanna twisted her head, avoiding the kiss and trying to remove Seven's hand from under her shirt.</p>
<p>"Seven, I said stop, please."</p>
<p>Seven moved to kiss B'Elanna's neck as she tried to free her hand from the restraint of the Klingon's. Her actions were getting rougher and B'Elanna began to feel angry. She pushed Seven aside and leapt to her feet.  </p>
<p>"What the hell was that about," she demanded?</p>
<p>Seven looked up at her, her expression entirely Borg.  "Lieutenant Torres, if you are not interested in pursuing this relationship with me than you could do me the courtesy of being honest.  I will not be made a fool of."</p>
<p>"What the hell are you talking about Seven?  You're the one who is acting like we just met one minute and then crawling all over me the next."  </p>
<p>"What was on the PADD you and Ensign Kim were looking at during dinner?"</p>
<p>B'Elanna's head was swimming as she tried to keep up with the twist in the conversation.  "What the hell does that have to do with you being all over me like a Targ in heat just now," she demanded?</p>
<p>"I wish to know what you and Ensign Kim were doing."</p>
<p>B'Elanna was getting really angry now and spoke without thinking&amp;#133; "It's none of your damn business what we were doing."</p>
<p>Seven said nothing, merely stared at B'Elanna as if she were a bug under a microscope.</p>
<p>"Very well, if you are incapable of being honest with me than I shall have to be the one to terminate the relationship." She replied and was gone from the room before B'Elanna could reply</p>
<p>"What the fuck just happened," B'Elanna said out loud as she watched the doors to her quarters shut.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was furious now and she ran out of her quarters and down the hall after Seven.  She caught up with her outside the turbolift, grabbing her arm and spinning her around so they were facing.  She demanded, "do you want to explain to me what just happened in there?"</p>
<p>"I have nothing to explain, I have acted honorably, it is you who are keeping secrets and being deceitful.  You do not desire me sexually and you will not share your life with me, there is nothing more to talk about."</p>
<p>"Seven, damn it, I'm not going to have this conversation in the hallway."</p>
<p>"Then we will not have it at all."</p>
<p>B'Elanna lost it at that, she grabbed Seven's arm and proceeded to frog march her down the corridor and back to the quarters</p>
<p>"Computer seal the doors to my quarters."</p>
<p>"Seven, we are talking about this and we are talking now."</p>
<p>"Then tell me what you and Ensign Kim were discussing at dinner."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Comply."</p>
<p>"Seven it's none of your business."</p>
<p>"If you feel that way then we have nothing further to discuss. It is obvious you would rather be with Ensign Kim than me."</p>
<p>B'Elanna felt her anger peaking; Seven was standing rigidly with her hands behind her back and that infuriatingly superior look on her face. She was about to rip into Seven with a vengeance when she saw a single tear escape the drone's eye and track down her flushed face.  The logical part of B'Elanna's mind insisted she see beyond Seven's anger and remember that she had no experience with friendship let alone romantic relationships. She marshaled all of her control and spoke softly,</p>
<p>"Seven please just sit down and let's talk about this rationally."</p>
<p>She could clearly see Seven's pain and uncertainty as another tear began its journey.  Looking closely at the woman she loved B'Elanna could see that the younger women was trembling.  She took her arm and led her to the sofa, sitting her down gently and beginning to pace as she tried to find a way to get through to the now bereft-looking young woman.</p>
<p>She crossed to the couch in two quick steps, kneeling down she took Seven's hands in hers, caressing them softly she asked, "Seven, please tell me what's going on here."</p>
<p>"When I saw you in the messhall laughing and talking with Ensign Kim I felt, I believe the emotion is jealousy.  When I came to the table you ceased your activities and tried to hide the PADD you were working on.  You both exhibited rapid heart beats and an inability to meet my gaze directly, so I assumed you were hiding something of a personal nature, perhaps pertaining to our relationship or one that you and Mr. Kim were initiating."  She paused, waiting for the angry response she was certain B'Elanna was holding in.  She was surprised to feel the young Klingon squeeze her hands gently and urge, "go on Seven."</p>
<p>"I was unsure of what to do.  When you told me I was welcome to come back to your quarters I thought perhaps you were willing to give me another chance.  I thought that if I instigated a sexual encounter you might be willing to continue our relationship.  You have made it clear, however, that I was in error. I apologize for attacking you 'like a Targ in heat.' I will understand if you wish to pursue legal action in this matter." </p>
<p>B'Elanna was heartbroken at the pain and need in Seven's voice. "Seven, how can you even think that after I told you just this morning how much I loved you?"</p>
<p>"I assumed that once you were back in the larger population of the ship you realized that you could do better than a relationship with a Borg drone."</p>
<p>"Look, Seven, I love you, and I don't mind telling you that a hundred times a day if I need to, but at some point you are going to have to learn to trust that love if we are going to have a shot at making this work."</p>
<p>"I will comply."</p>
<p>B'Elanna laughed softly, "honey trust isn't something you just comply with, it is something that you build, that we will build together. I'm going to have other friendships and I hope that you are too, but you are the one I love, the one I chose to live my life with, and that isn't going to change just because I find a project to work on with someone else."</p>
<p>"So you and Ensign Kim were working on a project for the ship?" </p>
<p>"Seven, honestly, you're incorrigible, I'm not going to tell you what Harry and I were working on.  There are going to be times that we have secrets from one another.  Not about important things, but little secrets, ones that don't impact on our relationship in a negative way. Do you understand what I'm trying to say?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes Naomi Wildman tells me her secret thoughts and asks that I not reveal them to her mother.  Is this what you mean by 'little secrets.'"</p>
<p>"Exactly, you need to keep those secrets for your friend, and I have to trust that that doesn't mean that you love me any less."</p>
<p>"I believe I understand, but&amp;#133;"</p>
<p>"What sweetie, you know you can ask me anything?"</p>
<p>"Why do you not desire me sexually?"</p>
<p>The raw need and fear in Seven's voice cut B'Elanna to the core.  She shifted up onto the couch and pulled the young drone into her arms.  "I very much desire you sexually Seven.  In fact lately I have trouble thinking about anything other than how much I want you."</p>
<p>She took the beautiful young woman's face in both her hands, gazing deeply into her eyes, "there is something we need to make very clear.  Sex is not an answer to problems in a relationship.  You can't just think that if you're feeling insecure that you can 'instigate a sexual encounter' and make the worries go away.  As you can see it usually ends up having quite the opposite effect. I don't just want to have sex with you. I want to make love with you, and I want our first time to be perfect and special and someplace wonderful."</p>
<p>"It will be perfect as long as you are there."</p>
<p>"Seven, I know that, but for our first time I want some wonderful romantic adventure that we'll always remember.  Most of all I want us to be sure that we are both ready to make love, and that we aren't doing it just because we think we should, we're feeling insecure, or we think it might bring us closer."</p>
<p>"I believe I understand.  B'Elanna I am sorry that I questioned you honour.  I will attempt to have more control in the future."</p>
<p>"Let's just promise each other that we'll talk about stuff like this when it comes up.  We can work through these things together Ok."</p>
<p>"Ok."</p>
<p>They held each other tightly until Seven stirred, "it is late and you need your sleep after your first day back at work.  I should be going."</p>
<p>"Stay with me tonight Seven&amp;#133;please. I&amp;#133;"</p>
<p>Seven stopped B'Elanna's words with a kiss; she stood up and led the way to the bedroom.  </p>
<p>Seven wrapped her arms around B'Elanna, holding her close, sharing the feeling of warmth and safety as they fell asleep.</p>
<p>The next few weeks seemed to fly by.  B'Elanna was busy in engineering, but was also spending every available second working with Harry to perfect her holoprogram. Because she was busy she had less time to spend with Seven than she might have liked, but they made up for it by trying to work together in engineering whenever it was possible.  They found that they fought less now than they had previously, but on several occasions they found themselves shouting at one another in disagreement over how to proceed with one problem or another.  The difference now was that eventually they calmed down and reached an equitable solution.  Sometimes they even managed to laugh at themselves later when they recalled their disagreements.  Even though great progress had been made, B'Elanna still had to keep her Klingon temper in check on several occasions when she was gripped with an intense desire to start throwing things around the engine room.</p>
<p>Seven missed the time she used to be able to spend with B'Elanna when the engineer had been confined to her quarters, and she was shocked at how often she struggled with her jealousy over B'Elanna's other friendships.  She disliked that illogical part of her that seemed to begrudge B'Elanna's finding happiness with other people.  She had learned from past mistakes, however, and when she felt that she might be getting out of control she talked it over with B'Elanna. She never ceased to be amazed at how understanding and gentle the usually volatile Klingon could be in helping her to come to grips with her emotions.  Still, after several days of little or no personal time with <b>her </b>Klingon she had come up with a plan, and was determined not to be denied. She was a woman with a mission.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was getting very frustrated.  She had been pouring over the diagnostics from the shield generators for hours.  There was a problem maintaining a stable matrix, and she was worried that the shields might fail the next time they really needed them.  She knew she was missing something, but she just couldn't seem to locate the problem.  Growling in anger she hurled the PADD she was studying at the wall of her office.  It hit the wall with a satisfying crack just a second after the door opened and Seven of Nine stepped into her office.</p>
<p>Seven observed the demise of the PADD with a wry smile, and raising her ocular implant to impossible heights asked dryly, "Lieutenant Torres, are you attempting to initiate a Klingon mating ritual with me?"</p>
<p>"Wha, huh, um no, I mean, Sorry Seven, I didn't see you come in."</p>
<p>"Indeed."</p>
<p>"What, ah, what can I do for you Seven?" B'Elanna was still flustered over Seven's reference to the Klingon mating ritual.</p>
<p>"You can agree to spend the evening with me."</p>
<p>It was on the tip of B'Elanna's tongue to decline as she had plans to meet with Harry to finalize the last details of the program, but Seven looked so hopeful that B'Elanna quickly agreed.  The program could wait another day.</p>
<p>"I will pick you up at your quarters at 1800hr.  Casual attire will be appropriate."</p>
<p>"Great, it's a date."</p>
<p>B'Elanna redoubled her efforts on the shield grid and was rewarded with success a mere half-hour before she was to be ready to go with Seven.  She logged off duty and jogged to her quarters, grabbing a shower and trying to figure out what a Borg's idea of casual attire could possibly mean.  She finally settled for black dress pants and a cream shirt.  She was just doing up the last button on her shirt when the chime to her quarters sounded.</p>
<p>"Come in."</p>
<p>Seven appeared in her quarters wearing a blue biosuit.  B'Elanna smiled to herself thinking that they would really have to come up with a wider wardrobe for Seven.</p>
<p>"You know the codes to the door Seven you don't have to knock."</p>
<p>"I thought it was appropriate given that we are embarking on an official date."</p>
<p>"Ok, then, I believe this is the part of the evening when I tell you how beautiful you look."</p>
<p>"You may proceed."  </p>
<p>"Seven of Nine, you look lovely this evening."</p>
<p>"As do you B'Elanna Torres&amp;#133;shall we?"  Seven offered her arm to B'Elanna, who smiled at the courtly gesture before linking arms with her date.</p>
<p>"Where are we going?"</p>
<p>"It is a surprise."</p>
<p>Seven wasn't kidding it was a surprise.  Holding her arm gently Seven led B'Elanna straight to&amp;#133;</p>
<p>"Astrometrics, our date is in astrometrics?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it was the most romantic place I could think of aboard Voyager."</p>
<p>B'Elanna was certain she could come up with about a dozen more romantic places, including Jefferies Tube 36, but Seven looked so eager that she merely smiled and said, "lead on."</p>
<p>Seven led B'Elanna through the doors and into, yup, it was the astrometrics lab all right.  There was a rather large bundle in the corner and Seven went to fetch it. When she came back she led B'Elanna up to the dais. She placed the bundle on top of the dais and pushed it off to one side.  She then turned to B'Elanna and placed her hands on her waist and lifted her up until she was sitting on the edge of the raised platform.  In one graceful movement she was sitting beside B'Elanna.  She kissed her tenderly for a moment before crawling over and unpacking the mysterious package.</p>
<p>She pulled out a large blanket and proceeded to spread it out over the dais.  The bundle also contained a number of large fluffy pillows that she propped against the back of the console.  The last item was a picnic basket, which she proceeded to unpack.  All B'Elanna could do was stare in amazement as she brought out a bottle of wine, some cheese and crackers and two stasis containers. She spread out the little feast and opened the bottle of wine; she then leaned over the console and entered in several commands.  The view screen came to life and displayed a beautiful expanse of stars that B'Elanna recognized from her home planet of Kessik IV.</p>
<p>B'Elanna was absolutely speechless.  Seven motioned her over to the blanket and B'Elanna crawled over obediently.  </p>
<p>"What is all this?"</p>
<p>"It is a picnic. I thought you might find it relaxing&amp;#133;do you not like it?"</p>
<p>"Like it, Seven I love it.  This is absolutely perfect."</p>
<p>Seven poured the wine as B'Elanna made herself comfortable against the pillows.  She took the proffered glass and raised it to Seven, "to perfect evenings."</p>
<p>"To perfect evenings," Seven repeated as she sipped her wine.</p>
<p>"Tell me about these stars," Seven asked.</p>
<p>B'Elanna pointed out several of the constellations she recognized as Seven began to feed her small bites of bread and cheese. The feeling of being fed was incredibly sensuous and B'Elanna kissed the beautiful fingers as they brought the tender morsels to her mouth.  </p>
<p>Suddenly the scene on the viewscreen changed and B'Elanna found herself looking at a stellar nursery that Voyager had passed several years ago.  The swirling hues of colour were absolutely breathtaking as they contrasted with the utter darkness at the core of the nursery.  It was the second most beautiful sight that B'Elanna had ever seen.</p>
<p>The screen displayed one wondrous vision after another as they ate.  Seven had prepared a pasta dish she knew B'Elanna liked and for desert she had assembled a simple collection of fruits, which she also proceeded to feed to B'Elanna by hand.</p>
<p>At the end of the evening they lay together against the pillows, sipping the last of the wine as the final image shimmered onto the screen.  It was a binary star system that B'Elanna had never seen before.</p>
<p>"I do not know the names of these stars, Voyager passed them several months ago.  They are caught in one another's gravitational pull.  When I first saw them I thought it was said that they would never achieve individuality, but now I see how beautiful it is that will always be together.  They will dance together, just the two of them, fueled only by the force of their own attraction to one another, forever."</p>
<p>"I never knew you were such a poet Seven."</p>
<p>"Nor did I, until I met you.  I simply know that I wish to hold you forever, just like those stars."</p>
<p>"Forever is a very long time," B'Elanna said as she reached up to kiss her lover.</p>
<p>"Not nearly long enough Beloved," Seven whispered as their lips met.</p>
