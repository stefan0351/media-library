<!-- Whither Thou Goest \ Chapter One -->

<P>Willow was crying again, not deep wrenching sobs, but soft, almost soundless
tears that seemed to go on forever. Just in from patrol, Buffy silently peeled
off her jacket and put away her weapons bag, painfully aware of the tiny sounds
as she tried to tamp down a wave of nagging guilt. She knew she was doing a
sucky job as a best friend. With camouflage commandos running around campus,
Spike living in Gile's bathtub, plus school, semi-dating Riley or at least being
pursued by and considering semi-dating Riley, and of course her usual vampire
killing duties, she just hadn't had time for doing the sort of
best-friend-helping-best-friend-get-over-guy-by-eating-too-much-chocolate-and-plotting-vengeance
sorts of activities -- Buffy sighed softly -- and maybe there'd been a bit of
avoidance mixed in there as well, she admitted in a darkness inspired flash of
discomfiting honesty. That whole Cro-Magnon necking experience had thrown her
equilibrium more than she cared to admit, not just because she'd enjoyed it, but
because as much as she'd pursued Parker and now Riley during the day, it was
Willow she seemed to be dreaming about at night--starting shortly after Angel's
exit from Sunnydale, and seemingly growing in intensity with every passing
night--strange dreams full of tenderness and sensuality that left her panting
and painfully aware of her own body when she woke. It was all just a little too
confusing--and now that Oz was gone from Willow's life --at least
temporarily--maybe just a little too tempting.</P>
<B><I>
<P>Sniff.</P>
</I></B>
<P>The soft sound reminded Buffy of just where her line of thought had begun. <I>That's
good, Buffy</I>, she castigated herself, <I>can you get any more self-centered?</I>
<I>Willow's hurting, and are you thinking about her? No, you're worrying about
yourself. And after all the times she's done the sympathize-over-the-boyfriend
thing for you. If you can manage to be just a little <B>more</B> sympathetic,
maybe she won't turn down that whole Vengeance Demon gig next time.</P>
</I><B><I>
<P>Sniff.</P>
</I></B>
<P>"Hey, Will," the Slayer said very softly as she drew close to the
bed. The sniffles instantly stopped and she could almost hear Willow trying not
be heard crying. Buffy sighed softly again. Oh, she'd mouthed all the right
platitudes, but it suddenly bothered her that she hadn't spent nearly enough
time offering Willow the kind of unconditional support Willow had offered her
under similar circumstances. Hell, Spike had been more in tune with the fact
that she was walking on the edge. "I know you're awake," she added
gently and heard another soft sniff that made her heart clench with guilt. No
wonder Willow had nearly wound up bailing from the good guy's team.</P>
<P>"Maybe a little," a tiny voice admitted in the darkness.</P>
<P>Buffy silently took a seat on the edge of Willow's bed, startlingly aware of
the warmth of her friend's body where it nudged up against her hip. "I
just..." Buffy began hesitantly. "I wanted to talk to you." She
reached out, resting her hand lightly on Willow's hip, moving her thumb in a
gentle circular pattern.</P>
<P>"Oh," Willow exhaled in a tiny voice. "I guess you were out
slaying tonight."</P>
<P>"Yeah," Buffy said, her tone brushing the subject aside.
"Look, Will, I know things have been really difficult
lately...and...well...I just...some apologies are in order--"</P>
<P>"Buffy, I'm sorry," Willow apologized instantly. "I mean I'm
really sorry about that whole spell thing and causing you and Spike
to...well...kiss...and all that...I mean I really didn't know--"</P>
<P>"Shhh," Buffy hushed while Willow kept apologizing until the Slayer
laid her fingers lightly over her friend's lips. "That's not the apology I
was referring to."</P>
<P>"Oh," Willow murmured, then drew a sharp breath. "I'm sorry if
I haven't really been a lot of fun lately, and if the whole crying thing has
been keeping you up--"</P>
<P>"Will, don't," Buffy interrupted the ongoing apology, feeling worse
with every word Willow had said. God, she really hadn't been getting it right
lately. "I meant the apology I owe you."</P>
<P>Willow went completely still. "You owe me?" she repeated
doubtfully.</P>
<P>"Yeah," Buffy confirmed. "I haven't done a great job of being
a friend...since...well...lately." Buffy sighed tiredly, leaning forward,
her elbows braced on her knees, fingers loosely intertwined. "I dunno,"
she exhaled. "It's like I've been kind of out of control, not knowing
whether I was coming or going...I should have realized what a hard time you were
having...and been there for you..." She reached over and curved her fingers
around Willow's hand and swallowed hard. "You're the best friend I've ever
had...and I'm sorry I failed you. You shouldn't have been crying alone."</P>
<P>Willow sniffed back on her tears, blinked rapidly to clear her vision as she
peered up at the Slayer's shadowed profile. Slowly, she pushed upright, sitting
cross-legged, elbows braced on her knees. "Thanks," she whispered at
last. She'd entered college so confident, feeling like someone totally
different, but losing Oz had shaken her newfound collegiate composure. "I
just didn't want to be a burden...I've tried to...tried to cover things
up...but...."</P>
<P>"I know," Buffy sighed, remembering how that had turned out.
"And the whole covering up thing--well, in light of that whole vengeance
demon thing--maybe not such a good idea."</P>
<P>Willow turned her hand under Buffy's, clinging tightly and blinked rapidly,
trying to clear the hot tears stinging her eyes. "It's just that everything
seems wrong lately...not just Oz...everything...."</P>
<P>Buffy frowned ever so slightly. She knew the feeling. She 'd been feeling
increasingly disconnected for months and nothing seemed to fix it. At first
she'd attributed it to Angel's move to Los Angeles and tried to lose it in the
pursuit of other men, but more recently that explanation had seemed less and
less likely. Perhaps it was just the change from high school to college--<I>or
maybe it's those dreams you don't want to admit to</I>, a tiny voice whispered
in her ear, <I>the ones where you can't seem to keep your hands off your best
friend, where she's not just your best friend, but also your lover, your
partner, and the best thing that's ever happened in your life</I>. "That's
not it," Buffy hissed at the recalcitrant voice only to get an odd look
from Willow.</P>
<P>"Buff?"</P>
<P>"Sorry," the Slayer apologized hurriedly. "Just talking to
myself."</P>
<P>Willow nodded understandingly. She'd always tended to talk to herself and
lately that tendency had extended to long, unwanted conversations. She stared
down at her hands, studying the complicated network of bones, tendons and veins
as she avoided looking at the Slayer.</P>
<P>"Talk to me, Will," Buffy said after several long moments of
silence.</P>
<P>There were so many thoughts running through Willow's head in disjointed,
random pathways that she barely knew where to begin. "Do you think about
them?" she asked at last.</P>
<P>The question left Buffy confused and she stared at her friend, nonplused.
"Who?"</P>
<P>"The demons and vampires you've killed?" The hacker looked up, lost
in thought as she stared at a random point somewhere in the distance.</P>
<P>"Sometimes," Buffy admitted hesitantly, not wanting to admit that
sometimes she couldn't stop thinking about it. She knew they were demons, knew
she had no choice in what she did, but they looked human enough, had
personalities, sometimes even begged for their lives. Even knowing what she did,
it bothered her more often than she cared to admit.</P>
<P>"Because I can't stop thinking about Veruca," Willow whispered,
then shook her head, refocusing on Buffy. "I mean, she was our age....and
she's dead...and I--"</P>
<P>"What happened wasn't your fault, Will. She was going to kill you. If Oz
hadn't--"</P>
<P>"It's not just that," Willow cut her friend off, trying to find a
way to explain what she was feeling, the thoughts that had been running through
her head since that night. She took a deep breath, letting it out slowly in an
effort to clear her head. "She was human, Buffy...not dead and not a
demon--"</P>
<P>"She was a werewolf, Will," Buffy reminded her friend.</P>
<P>"And so's Oz, but he hasn't given way to the darkness. So why did she go
the way she did? What made the difference in her life?"</P>
<P>Buffy started to answer, but held her words back. True, Oz hadn't given in to
the wolf, but he was afraid of it, and she suspected there was a wildness there
that was never going away and might just be getting stronger. Oz would never
hurt any of them willingly, and she was quite certain that was one of the
reasons he'd left. He was afraid he couldn't control it much longer.
"No," she said at last.</P>
<P>"But he's afraid of it," Willow exhaled at last as if reading
Buffy's thoughts. She released her hold on Buffy's hand to let her head fall
forward into her palms.</P>
<P>"Will, if this is about Oz leaving--"</P>
<P>"It's not," the hacker denied and then looked up, her eyes damp
with tears. "I'm afraid of it too," she whispered raggedly.</P>
<P>Buffy stared at her friend in confusion. "Afraid of Oz?" she
questioned at last. Wolf or no wolf, she knew Oz would die before he'd hurt
Willow.</P>
<P>Willow shook her head, frustrated by Buffy's inability to understand what she
was saying. "No, of my own darkness."</P>
<P>The Slayer tensed, shaking her head in denial. "You don't have
any--" she began instantly.</P>
<P>"For God's sake, Buffy, I just got offered a job as a vengeance demon.
Clearly I have darkness issues."</P>
<P>Buffy opened her mouth to argue only to snap it shut again. Willow had a
point. "Okay," she murmured after a long beat, not knowing what else
to say.</P>
<P>Willow drew another deep breath and heaved a heavy sigh. "It's just that
I have this need to know more...to learn more about what I can do...but...but,
it's scary too sometimes...and sometimes..."</P>
<P>Buffy just kept listening to her friend, doing the one thing she hadn't had
time for amid her own needs and emergencies. She'd been there for Willow that
night--saving her life--but during the weeks since she'd been all too absent and
it was obvious there was a lot more going on here than she'd suspected. This
wasn't just the I-can't-get-over-the-boyfriend blues. It went a lot deeper. And
Willow clearly needed to get it off her chest.</P>
<P>The silence that lay between them wasn't the comfortable, friendly studying
together sort. It was more the uncomfortable,
how-in-the-hell-am-I-supposed-to-say-what-I'm-really-trying-to-say kind of
thing. Not simple even for the best of friends.</P>
<P>"I was casting a spell that night," Willow whispered at last,
swallowing back harsh tears to continue. "I just wanted him to hurt as much
as I did...I could feel it, Buffy--the power, the temptation. It was like it was
calling to me." The hacker shook her head slowly, shivering as she
remembered the sensation of dark energy coursing through her. "For a moment
I could almost understand Faith."</P>
<P>Buffy shivered as though someone had walked over her grave. "You could
never be like her, Will."</P>
<P>"Yes, I could," Willow disagreed. "I almost was...it was only
at the last moment that I couldn't...and then Veruca got there...and Oz..."
she trailed off, staring down at her hands with hypnotic intensity.</P>
<P>Buffy tried to find the words to offer comfort. "But you didn't do
it...you pulled back. We're all tempted sometimes--"</P>
<P>"But what happens if I <I>can't</I> pull back some day? I could hurt
someone, Buffy." She dragged slender fingers through sleep tousled hair.
"I dunno. Maybe I should just leave too...just go away where I can't hurt
anyone--"</P>
<P>"No!" Buffy snapped instantly, the very thought sending a bolt of
terror through her. Willow couldn't leave. That simply wasn't an option. She
caught Willow's hands in strong fingers, massaging them soothingly as she held
on tightly. "Don't talk like that," she insisted more calmly.
"You're not like Veruca <I>or</I> Faith...you have people who care for
you...who'll help you." Buffy had to resist the urge to lift those slender
hands and press soothing kisses across her knuckles the way she had in a
half-remembered dream. "You just have to trust us...let us help you." <I>And
by that</I>--that insistent part of brain clarified--<I>you mean let <B>me</B>
help you</I>. "But you have to be honest...you have to tell us...tell
me...when you need help." Buffy's gaze dropped to their twined hands to
hide the guilt she was feeling. "And if that means a two by four to my
thick skull...well...you do what you have to and play <I>'Whack a Slayer.'</I>"
The silence stretched out between them, while Buffy kept her head down, not
quite confident enough to look up and see Willow's expression.</P>
<P>"Oh...great..." the hacker drawled at last, a touch of humor
threading through her voice. "Are you trying to get me killed...<I>'Whack
the Slayer'</I> indeed..."</P>
<P>Buffy risked a glance at her friend, relaxing as she glimpsed a watery smile
lighting her gamine features.</P>
<P>"Though," the other girl continued, "as hard as your head is,
I'm not sure you'd notice."</P>
<P>Buffy chuckled at that. "Yeah," she agreed on a relieved sigh.
"It is pretty solid."</P>
<P>The mood broken, Willow reached out and mimed knocking her friend on the side
of the head. "Solid wood," she teased.</P>
<P>"Hey, that's a plus when you're the Slayer. How do you think I take out
all those vamps? I just head-butt 'em with my pointy, little, wooden head,"
Buffy defended with mock-indignation before turning serious once again. "I
mean it though, Will, the only way any of us get through life in Sunnyhell is by
sticking together--if it wasn't for you, Giles, and Xander, I'd have been dead a
long time ago--so you've got to promise to come to us when things start closing
in on you." <I>Come to <B>me</B> when things start closing in on you</I>,
that inescapable inner commentator amended loudly enough that Buffy wondered if
she'd spoken the words aloud for just a moment.</P>
<P>"Yeah," Willow exhaled and the two girls sat silently for a long
moment.</P>
<P>Suddenly Buffy bounded to her feet. "Come on, up and at 'em," she
commanded with a laugh as she spun away and began digging through Willow's
closet, tugging out clothes with unusual abandon.</P>
<P>Willow blinked in sleepy confusion. "'Scuse me?" she questioned.</P>
<P>Buffy pivoted neatly to face her friend. "I've been remiss in the whole
best-friend department," she explained. "We haven't done a chocolate
and sympathy night yet."</P>
<P>"Buffy, it's two o'clock in the morning," Willow pointed out
reasonably, but the Slayer was not to be deterred.</P>
<P>"Look, Will, at times like this, the only surefire cure is a total
junkaholic pigout. Chocolate, chips, anything that's loaded with grease and bad
for you."</P>
<P>Willow stared at her friend with a faintly perplexed smile. "I repeat,
it's two o'clock in the morning. Where do you plan on getting this junkfeast?
Besides, chocolate never solved anything."</P>
<P>"Answer to question one." Buffy held up a finger to keep count.
"We're college students, where do we get any kind of food-type-stuff."</P>
<P>"Twenty-four/Seven," both girls chimed in at the same time,
referring to the 24 hour quickie mart on the edge of campus, where the food was
stale, the prices high, the beer domestic, and the help surly. It was, of
course, where all the college students got most of their non-collegiate All
Aboard Card approved survival provisions, like beer, circus peanuts, beer, Count
Chokula, beer, Ding Dongs, and, of course, beer.</P>
<P>"And as for solving things," Buffy continued. "It's broccoli
that never solved anything. Chocolate can solve everything."</P>
<P>"You've been watching Mary Tyler Moore reruns on Nick at Night again,
haven't you?" Willow demanded, but allowed herself to be pulled from bed by
her eager to bring good cheer roommate.</P>
<P>"Hey, she's gonna make it after all, doncha know?" Buffy thrust the
clothes she'd chosen at Willow. "I find this a very inspiring
message." She turned away at her friend's pointed look, trying not to
listen too avidly as she heard clothes being removed and then put on. "I
always thought Mary woulda made a good Slayer, y'know," Buffy continued,
chatting in an effort not to think about Willow standing naked or near-naked
just behind her. Those dreams really had been getting to her. She couldn't help
but wonder what her friend would think if she knew about them. Be horrified
probably, she concluded, though that taunting voice kept suggesting she ask and
find out.</P>
<P>"Nah," Willow disagreed as she finished dressing. "Mary was
too soft-hearted. She'd have let them go."</P>
<P>"Rhoda then?" Buffy mused aloud as she caught Willow's hand in her
own, dragging her out into the hallway.</P>
<P>"Nah, the one who would have made a really killer Slayer was Ida."</P>
<P>"Ida?" the Slayer repeated as she drew a blank on the name.</P>
<P>"Y'know, Rhoda's mother. The little redhead."</P>
<P>"Oooo, you're right. She <I>was</I> mean. Must have been the hair. You
know what they say about redheads."</P>
<P>"Hey!" the redhead yelped, but she clung tightly to her best
friend's hand as they wandered away into the night.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</P>
<P>The Twenty-Four/Seven was like most such places; small, cramped, full of
stale candy, overpriced sandwiches, canned beer, and underaged students trying
to buy all of the above using parentally paid for credit cards and illegally
altered I.D.s. Even as Buffy and Willow entered and began moving among the
narrow aisles, plucking up an assortment of the nastiest candy and chips they
could find, they were treated to the sounds of a pretty young blond arguing
vociferously with the clerk at the counter, who was a hundred if he was a day.</P>
<P>"Dammit, all I want is one beer," she snarled in frustration, while
the clerk peered at her ID through coke-bottle glasses.</P>
<P>"I'll admit, it's a good fake," he allowed grudgingly.</P>
<P>Buffy peered over the shelves just as he looked up at his youthful nemesis
over the edge of his glasses. "But we both know it's a fake."</P>
<P>The young woman slapped a hand on the counter. "Look, just because I'm
cursed with good genes--"</P>
<P>"That's nice," the clerk said smoothly and tossed the card
somewhere under the counter. "But nobody has genes that good--"</P>
<P>"Now, wait one damn minute...."</P>
<P>Buffy ducked back behind the shelves, blushing with embarrassment as she was
reminded of her own adventures in beer-drinking.</P>
<P>Willow looked over to meet Buffy's gaze, her own cheeks flushing with her own
memories of that night--of being cuddled up against the warmth of Buffy's body,
the feel of primitively eager lips on her own.</P>
<P>"Heh," Buffy half-laughed on a nervous quaver. "Beer...now
there's something I'd just as soon go through the rest of my life not thinking
about."</P>
<P>"I dunno, NeanderBuffy had her charms," Willow teased before she
had a chance to think about it and squelch the impulse.</P>
<P>Buffy's eyes rounded, her mouth forming a perfect O as she stared at her
friend in surprise. "Will," she croaked, because, while she supposedly
didn't remember that night--though, in reality, it was clear as a bell, a
frequently ringing bell in view of how often it seemed to replay in her
head--Willow unquestionably remembered and didn't even have the protection of
feigned forgetfulness. "I...uh..." Not for the first time, the Slayer
wondered what her best friend thought of the whole experience. She certainly
didn't sound repulsed by the memory.</P>
<P>By then Willow had realized what she'd said and tripped right into babble
mode. "I...that is...I meant...."</P>
<P>Both girls fell silent, staring at each other, uncertain what to say or do,
both remembering the heated intimacies they'd shared in the darkness, each
wondering what the other was thinking.</P>
<P>"Look, will you at least kindly return my driver's license," the
young customer's angry voice broke in on their unspoken conversation, saving
both girls the necessity of a response.</P>
<P>Buffy straightened, peering over the edge of the shelves once again,
automatically checking to make sure things weren't getting out of hand.</P>
<P>"Look, kid, look at it this way; I'm doing you a favor. A cop catch you
with that thing and you'd be in real trouble," the clerk lectured, though
Buffy noticed there was a certain malicious glee in his eyes. Working amid frat
rats and sorority chicks, not to mention all those goddamn GDI's had not left
him overly fond of the college age crowd.</P>
<P>The young woman leaned across the counter, her hands braced solidly on the
top. "Dammit, I don't have time for this..." She started to reach
across the counter.</P>
<P>Buffy tensed as she felt a familiar tingle of apprehension. "Will, stay
here," she snapped, dropping the half dozen things she was already carrying
and moving to round the end of the shelves. She slid her hand inside her jacket,
checking on the familiar weight of Mister Pointy where he resided in an inner
pocket.</P>
<P>The clerk reached out with a meaty fist, shoving the young woman back several
paces with an angry snarl. "Don't pull that garbage with me, little
girl!"</P>
<P>The tingle had become a raging shiver as Buffy moved forward, uncertain where
the danger came from, but knowing it was there.</P>
<P>The blond customer took a half step forward, her body language broadcasting
her anger as clearly as words and then suddenly pivoted, staring through the
broad glass panes that fronted the tiny store.</P>
<P>Buffy's gaze followed the other woman's less than a second later as time
shifted, slowing until it was measured in heartbeats instead of seconds.</P>
<P>The three men who came rushing through the double doors to the small store
were all dressed in black from the tips of their steel-toed jackboots to the
collars of their black dusters and the knit of their ski masks. The only trace
of color was a tiny rim of red stitching around the eyeholes of the ski masks,
Buffy noted with the perverse attention to detail that she'd learned as the
Slayer. Each carried a pump action shotgun, held high and pointed at the tiny
group of people.</P>
<P>Before Buffy could do more than draw a breath, the barrel of a shotgun was
shoved in her face.</P>
<P>"I wouldn't move, little girl," her assailant snarled, his voice
ragged with stress, his eyes both scared and excited where they gleamed behind
the rough knit of the mask.</P>
<P>Near the counter, the young woman who'd been arguing with the clerk was
receiving similar treatment, which meant Buffy didn't dare try anything. She was
certain she could disarm her attacker without injury, but there was too much
chance the others would get off a shot or two before she could do anything to
stop them.</P>
<P>The clerk apparently wasn't so cautious, because he made a dash for something
under the edge of the counter, only to crash headfirst into a shotgun butt. The
force behind the blow knocked him backwards into the cigarette display, sending
packs flying everywhere and upending a rack of adult magazines. He hit the floor
hard and before he could even think of trying anything else, the third assailant
vaulted the counter, slamming a hard kick into the man's chest.</P>
<P>"Man, that was stupid," the thief snarled as he heaved a final kick
at his victim, then began hammering on the cash register in an apparent attempt
to get at the money inside. Finally, he grabbed the clerk by the collar, hauling
him to his feet as he ordered, "Open it!"</P>
<P>Buffy risked a sideways glance out of the corner of her eye, mentally willing
Willow to stay down and quiet, as she tried to see if there was any sign of her
friend.</P>
<P>Still hidden behind the shelves, Willow crouched down, trying to think of a
way to help and coming up with absolutely nothing. Despite the generally deadly
quality of Twinkies, she was comparatively certain that throwing them at someone
wasn't likely to do much damage. Still crouched, she glanced up, noting the
rounded security mirror in one corner of the store which let her see where the
bad guys were positioned. Of course, if any of them looked up, they'd also see
where she was positioned, but there wasn't really much she could do about that.
She mentally calculated the distances, then eyed the shelves that formed her
scant cover. They were light enough that she thought she could probably shove
them over. If a couple of the thieves would just--</P>
<P>"You're pretty, little girl," the sneering leering voice broke into
Willow's half-formed plans and she peered up into the mirror just as the one
holding a shotgun on the would-be beerdrinker sidled up to the young woman near
the counter, jamming the barrel of the weapon against the underside of her jaw.
"Maybe we should just go in back and have a little party of our own."</P>
<P>She tensed, but didn't respond as he backed her against the counter, using
his body to pin her in place.</P>
<P>The clerk had finally gotten the now-battered cash register open, and the
thug behind the counter was merrily stripping the money out of the drawer and
shoving it in his pockets. "Hey, go for it, man." He turned, leering
at Buffy. "Maybe we should all have a party and..." And then he
trailed off.</P>
<P>Willow felt her heart skip at least a half a dozen beats as she realized he
was staring back at her reflection in the mirror.</P>
<P>"Shit, there's another one back there!" he shouted to his buddies
as he vaulted the counter.</P>
<P>Willow scrambled, stumbling backwards, but had neither the time to escape,
nor any available route. Somewhere in the distance, she heard Buffy call out her
name, but knew there was nothing the Slayer could do to help since she was as
vulnerable to a shotgun blast as anyone else. Her attacker was on her in a
second, rough hands grabbing at her clothes, and slamming her this way and that,
sending bags of chips and bottles of designer water flying. She tried to fight,
but he was too strong and too fast and she never had a chance. Upended by her
attacker, the world tumbled by at dizzying speed until suddenly she was hurled
forward to go skidding across the floor, not stopping until she bodily slammed
into a human barrier. Her ears ringing, Willow pushed up on one hand, leaning
against the legs that had stopped her wild skid, momentarily thinking they were
Buffy's until she realized the Slayer was in front of her, her head tipped back
by the pressure of the a shotgun barrel, every muscle in her body tense with the
barely leashed need to do something.</P>
<P>"Buffy, don't," Willow croaked, her voice sounding rough to her own
ears.</P>
<P>A hard hand dug into crimson hair, dragging Willow's head back as the one who
appeared to be the leader taunted, "Yeah, <I>Buffy</I>, don't."</P>
<P>She was shaking hard, dazed, tasting blood. God, they couldn't even go to a
quickie mart without something bad happening.</P>
<P>"Well, this is a nice development," the leader continued as he
leered down at her. "A dance partner for each of us."</P>
<P>A hand curved to Willow's shoulder, steadying her when she might have gone
down and she risked a glance up at the would-be beerdrinker. She was ghostly
pale, her hand cold and clammy where it was braced on Willow's shoulder. Willow
recognized the look of disbelieving horror on her face all too easily. When
she'd first known Buffy she'd felt that way on more than a few occasions. Of
course, those had been supernatural villains, not garden variety thugs, but the
terror wasn't so different. After all, most twenty year-olds consider themselves
immortal whether they've ever met otherworldly dangers or not.</P>
<P>The clerk, bleeding from his nose and mouth, pushed unsteadily to his feet,
an arm braced across his midsection. "Look, you've got the money you
wanted. Just go."</P>
<P>Before anyone could move, the leader slammed the butt of his shotgun into the
clerk's face, sending him crashing to the floor in an unmoving heap. "When
I want your opinion, I'll ask for it, old man." The leader chuckled,
enjoying his triumph.</P>
<P>Buffy's eyes gleamed with the promise of revenge. If she could just find a
way to distract them and get those shotguns aimed away from Willow and the other
woman, they'd learn that her Slaying skills weren't limited to vampires.</P>
<P>Somewhere in the distance, the pulsing wail of a siren could just barely be
heard and three would-be thieves tensed. "Well, damn," their leader
cursed. "Looks like we ought to take this show on the road." He
grabbed for the blond where she was pressed against the counter, yanking her
close and grinning when she flinched in distaste as his alcohol sour breath
washed across her face. Emboldened by his actions, the other two started to do
likewise.</P>
<P>"I don't think so," the Slayer's angry growl cut through the taut
silence of the quickie mart, drawing the attention of all three of the would-be
thieves as she yanked her arm back from her assailant.</P>
<P>Willow wondered if her mouth was hanging open. Didn't Buffy realize there was
a shotgun-- actually, three shotguns, the hacker realized as she noted that all
of them had swung their weapons toward the Slayer--pointed at her, and these
people were nuts.</P>
<P>The leader was visibly startled by the refusal, his eyes narrowing through
the holes in the ski-mask. "Excuse me?" he drawled, his tone thick
with sarcastic rage.</P>
<P>The blond shook her head stiffly. "I'm not going anywhere with
you," she said, her voice menacingly low. "If I'm going to die, I'd
just as soon do it here...on camera." She nodded toward the security camera
hanging inconspicuously in one corner. "And not out in the middle of
nowhere after you and your friends have all had a couple of turns."</P>
<P>Willow saw the fury in his stance. He was going to kill her. She could feel
it like a black cloud hanging around him. And then she felt the leader move,
bringing his arm back as he raised the weapon to strike out with it the way he
had before. No! She couldn't let that happen! The shotgun stocks were made of
wood, and Willow reached out without even knowing she was doing it. As he
slammed the butt end of the weapon forward with enough force to rend flesh and
break bone, she grabbed it back with her mind. It was like solid wall went up
between the gun stock and its intended target, stopping it several inches short
of the Slayer's face even as she lifted her hands to block the weapon.</P>
<P>For a long moment, they all froze, each of the participants staring at the
scene in shocked disbelief.</P>
<P>The thief stumbled back a half step, shaking the gun as though it had somehow
malfunctioned. It was all the distraction Buffy needed as her own attacker
looked away from his prey and toward his confused friend.</P>
<P>In that instant, time warped and slowed until each moment took an hour to
pass. In the first second the Slayer brought her hand up, slapping her forearm
into the gun barrel pressed against her throat and knocking it aside. Before he
had a chance to respond, she turned her hand, wrapping inhumanly strong fingers
around the barrel and wrenching the weapon away from her attacker. He barely had
time to blink before she snapped it into his face, knocking him backwards into a
rack of snack packs of chips where he lay unmoving.</P>
<P>As another second passed, Willow saw the two nearest attackers aim their
weapons at the Slayer--they wouldn't be using them as clubs anymore--and gritted
her teeth--mentally shoving them up and away from herself with panic driven
force only an instant before they went off with deafening impact.</P>
<P>With ceiling tiles raining down on them, a third second ticked by. Buffy
leapt at the men flanking Willow where she knelt, her back pressed tightly
against the counter, her shoulder pressed into the blond beerdrinker's hip. The
Slayer hit the nearest man hard, the impact throwing them both into Willow, the
blond, then the confused leader of the trio like a trail of human dominoes.</P>
<P>As the fourth second passed, Willow lost all sense of what was happening in
the scramble of bodies and limbs flailing randomly in desperate combat. A
shotgun went skittering harmlessly across the floor as the Slayer disarmed one
of the two men. Caught in the middle, the hacker was knocked about with little
control over the situation until, suddenly, a hard hand dug into her shirt
collar, hurling her aside.</P>
<P>Willow tumbled free of the fray just as the fifth second ticked away, twisted
and looked back in horror as she saw the leader--at least she thought it was
him--pull a long, slender stiletto from the back of his belt. The Slayer's back
was to him as him as she blocked a roundhouse swing from his partner in crime.
Willow heard the tortured sound of her own voice screaming in warning, "BUFFY!!"
as she lunged forward, bounding to her feet and hurtling herself at her best
friend's attacker with raw ferocity, determined that he would not harm her.</P>
<P>The sixth second saw the Slayer slam an elbow into the other thief's face,
shattering his nose as she tore the shotgun away from him with her other hand.
With only one of the attackers left, she spun toward her friend's call, horror
twisting her features as she saw the knife turn toward Willow even as she was
barreling straight toward it. There was no way Buffy could reach them in time
and she didn't even get a chance as the downed thief behind her managed to get a
hand around a free-standing shelf full of snack cakes and upended it into her
back.</P>
<P>As the clock counted down the seventh second, Willow saw Buffy skid and fall
forward while she was backpedaling wildly in an effort to escape the knife
thrust toward her. Her feet slid on the slick tiles, sending her crashing
backwards into a magazine rack. There was nowhere left to go and no time left to
go there anyway. Pain rattling through her back where she'd hit the sharp edged
metal rack, Willow's eyes instinctively snapped shut and she turned her head
away, blindly trying to escape the sight of the silver blade aimed toward her.</P>
<P>As the eighth second fell away, Willow was startled to feel a body impact
into her instead of the sharp blade of the stiletto. She blinked her eyes open
as blond hair touched her cheek, automatically wrapping her arms around the
slender figure that had somehow stumbled between her body and imminent doom. For
the briefest moment, she thought the blond hair that dusted across her face was
Buffy's, that somehow the Slayer had made it in time to put herself between
Willow and death one more time, but then she realized it was too short, while
the dead-weight figure in her arms was dressed all wrong. Unable to support the
other woman's weight, she could only cushion her boneless collapse to the floor
even as she heard her own voice screaming Buffy's name. Her eyes lifted to where
the thief stood over her, staring down at his victim with a wide-eyed look.</P>
<P>By the time the ninth second passed what he thought or didn't think was
irrelevant. Buffy took him down so quickly and so hard that it was unlikely he'd
be moving again on his own for at least a week. She scrambled past their
attacker, skidding to one knee beside Willow. "Will?" the Slayer
panted, terror making her eyes glitter with wild lights. All she knew was that
in one instant the knife had been headed for her friend, and then by the time
she was done with the bastard, Willow was cradling another victim in her arms.</P>
<P>Time began to collapse again, gaining momentum as the tenth second counted
off, the seconds moving by more quickly, tumbling away, never to be seen again.
"She needs an ambulance" the hacker panted. The woman in her arms lay
half on her side, shaking, her mouth working soundlessly as she instinctively
coiled her body around the knife still stuck in her gut.</P>
<P>The eleventh and twelfth second slid by while Willow comforted the bleeding
victim. "An ambulance?" the young woman croaked weakly, her body
trembling violently while her blood continued to spill onto the speckled floor
tiles. "Doctors...hospital...yeah...." She coughed heavily, blood
spilling onto her lips.</P>
<P>The clock ticked down the thirteenth and fourteenth seconds as Willow
promised, "It's going to be okay," trying to offer what scant comfort
she could, her hands quickly drenched in the flow of dark blood she was trying
in vain to staunch.</P>
<P>Another three seconds passed as the young woman struggled to speak.
"Don't think so," the blond groaned, her expression twisted by the
pain from her injury. "Gotta stop zigging when I oughta zag...." She
looked up at Willow, meeting the hacker's frightened gaze with one that was
oddly calm. "It's okay," she whispered weakly. Then she shuddered and
went horrifyingly limp in an instant.</P>
<P>More seconds came and went as Buffy felt for a pulse, fingers searching the
woman's slender throat. "Will," she whispered after a beat. "I
think she's dead."</P>
<P>The hacker shook her head slowly, wanting to deny the obvious; that another
human being had died in her place. "No...maybe there's a spell--"</P>
<P>Buffy kept searching, but there was no trace of a pulse and the skin beneath
her fingers was already cooling. "Will, she's gone." Buffy slid an arm
around Willow's shoulders, hugging her hard.</P>
<P>Less than thirty seconds and a woman lay dead.</P>
<P>And the frightening part for Buffy Summers was the fact that as angry and
disgusted as she was, a part of her was profoundly grateful that it wasn't her
best friend lying dead on the floor. <I>Admit it</I>, her inner voice pressed, <I>you
couldn't survive that</I>.</P>
<P>In one of the odder coincidences that had long dominated Buffy Summers life,
that was the moment the police chose to arrive, guns drawn, ready for action,
and less than a half a minute too late. As the first officer burst through the
door, barking a sharp order, "Hands in the air," Buffy barely
contained the urge to laugh hysterically.</P>
<P>Soon enough they hauled the still-unconscious, handcuffed thieves out.
Apparently, the clerk had managed to trip some kind of silent alarm to summon
them, but they hadn't come quickly enough to do anything but clean up the mess
and send the clerk to the hospital. The officers that took both girls'
statements, were appropriately sympathetic, but there were a lot of details to
go over, especially when a detective pulled Buffy's name and file from the
police computer. As the questioning continued, in the background a forensics
team carefully took pictures of the dead woman, then zipped her into a plastic
body bag. It was going to be a long night.</P>
