<!-- Whither Thou Goest \ Chapter Nine -->

<P>Buffy returned to their dorm room to find Willow still diligently working on her laptop, nearly a ream of printouts, a couple of empty chip and candy wrappers and what looked like about a half a dozen empty cans of <I>Jolt </I><SUP><FONT SIZE="2">(tm)</FONT></SUP> Cola standing in mute testimony to the hours of research she'd already put in.</P>
<P>Buried in her work, she didn't realize the Slayer had entered until she felt strong hands land on her shoulders, and Buffy leaned down to see the screen as she murmured near Willow's ear, &quot;I hope I don't have to read all of that before tonight.&quot; The Slayer gestured toward the thick stack of papers.</P>
<P>Willow felt her heart catch as she turned in her chair, eyes lifting to so she was looking at the Slayer's profile. &quot;I-I didn't hear you come in,&quot; she stammered, startled to find herself no longer alone.</P>
<P>Buffy smiled, oddly happy just to be back in her friend's company. With Willow, she could almost forget the danger stalking them all. &quot;What can I say, silent Slayer feet.&quot; She nodded toward the computer screen. &quot;It looks like you found something.&quot; Then she glanced at the stack of printouts again. &quot;Quite a lot of something, actually.&quot;</P>
<P>Willow nodded. &quot;I've been scanning all of the art history sources that have any information on Delaine DuCourvallier and cross matching the information with anything I can find on secret British societies of the period.&quot; She glanced at the stack of papers. &quot;I just printed everything I could find.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And?&quot; Buffy prompted.</P>
<P>&quot;I've only had time to skim things and try to pull out what looks most important--but there's not really a whole lot that's very substantial after her supposed death in Italy. Before that, there's a fair amount, mostly because she was from one of the more powerful families in France, but it's not very interesting...at least not that I've found so far...mostly an accounting of how the estates were run and political alliances and stuff. The Watcher stuff on the other hand, is pretty sparse but pretty gruesome. So you want to start pre or post fangs?&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy sighed softly, wishing she was surprised, but the council never had been terribly forthcoming when it came to information. &quot;Let's go for the beginning of fanginess and post-fanginess,&quot; Buffy said as she pulled her chair over and sank down on it, sitting backwards with her chin pillowed on the backrest.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, if we back it up just a little, we find that she was pretty well educated, particularly for a woman of the time. Her mother came from a family with some pretty funny ideas--like the notion that women should be just as educated as men--&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How strange of them,&quot; Buffy interrupted with more than a touch of sarcasm.</P>
<P>&quot;In this period it was,&quot; Willow noted before continuing. &quot;Her mother had her tutored in French, English, Latin, music, mathematics, and even science and astronomy. Now, strange as it may seem, this didn't particularly please the Watchers. In fact, there are several mentions of sanctions against her for reading various books in her Watcher's library--&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They punished her for reading?&quot; Buffy said disbelievingly as she tried to envision Giles doing anything that boneheaded. More often than not, the man was frustrated because Buffy couldn't keep up with both her classroom studies and whatever research he wanted done at any given time. &quot;I'm thinking that's a little weird.&quot;</P>
<P>Willow nodded her agreement. &quot;From what little I can tell--I mean it's not like they just laid it all out--the Watchers liked to have absolute control over the flow of information their Slayer's received. Literacy was not encouraged.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Charming,&quot; the Slayer murmured thoughtfully. Certainly, they'd never been pleased with her unconventional way of doing things, and from what she'd seen with both Faith and Kendra, they had no great interest in seeing their Slayer's educated beyond the skills required for vampire killing even in the present. She'd been lucky that, as Watcher's went, Giles was nearly as unconventional, in his own stuffy way, as she was.</P>
<P>Willow grabbed one of Giles' journals off the stack of books, flipping it open to a page she'd already flagged. &quot;She was also in trouble because she hated the killing--they accused her of being sympathetic to the demons--she hated the fighting--they implied she was a coward--and she kept sneaking paints into her room--which of course, they completely forbade....&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of course.&quot; Buffy didn't want to admit how much she was relating to the long lost Slayer, despite Giles' remonstrations. Of course, whoever that girl had been, she was long dead, her soul freed from her body to be replaced by a demonic thing. She gnawed on her lower lip as she determinedly reminded herself of that reality. Whatever sympathy she was feeling had no place in the present. The Vampire-Slayer had to die. She just had to keep reminding herself of what she'd done to Xander and her mother.</P>
<P>&quot;Four years after being taken to England, she tried to run away... they dragged her back...and then she apparently made a deal with the local vampires to kill her Watcher--&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;She must have thought it was the only way she could escape them,&quot; Buffy mused out loud.</P>
<P>Willow nodded. &quot;Yeah...only instead of her Watcher, it was his wife, Elizabeth VanOoten, who was killed. They caught Delaine the same night it happened and she was put on trial.&quot; Willow looked up at Buffy again. &quot;Unfortunately, according to this, any trial transcripts were burned when the vampires attacked <I>during</I> the trail. They decimated the council--only two members survived--and turned Delaine. One of the accounts claims she gave herself to them, shouting that she'd destroy the council now...if she had to destroy the whole world to do it. After that, they spent the next several years rebuilding the core council from a surviving group of lower level Watchers.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And DuCourvallier?&quot; Buffy interrupted. She didn't care about the council. She cared about her enemy.</P>
<P>&quot;She disappeared. According to this, they've had hit teams out looking for her every day since she was turned. Looks to me like they haven't done the greatest job though, because the records are really sparse. She was supposedly involved in several pretty nasty demonic summonings in the two decades that followed as well a series of attacks on the council during the 1670's and 80's, but there are very few details. Apparently she didn't leave survivors.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy paled. No survivors. God, her mother had been lucky. She resolved to buy Xander...well, not a beer, because they were all off the stuff anymore, but something. Maybe a milkshake. No, not nearly enough. Burger, fries and the works to go with it. Hell, she'd just buy him junkfood till he couldn't eat anymore. It was as good a way as any to blow her college fund.</P>
<P>The Slayer was still lost in thought as Willow flipped to another page, her finger tracing over the ancient, yellowed parchment. &quot;Giles' account of how strong and fast she was looks to be pretty accurate though...at least if this one story is true. She was spotted going toe to toe with a demon better than twice her height in the 1740's, and she was the one still standing when it was over...but the street they were on wasn't.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy let out a soft whistle. That wasn't good.</P>
<P>&quot;She pops up again in the account by a Watcher tracing vampiric activity in China during the 1840's. The country was in a mess because of the Opium Wars with England--the British kept forcing the import of opium when the Chinese tried to ban it-- Anyway, apparently, her preferred...method...of feeding....&quot; Willow sounded ill.</P>
<P>&quot;Just spill it, Will,&quot; Buffy prompted.</P>
<P>&quot;She'd buy an addicted prostitute opium, let her use it...and then...when she was....&quot; Willow fell silent, a muscle pulsing in her jaw. She took a breath, getting herself under control before continuing, &quot;After the prostitute had used the drug...and was...well, inebriated...she'd feed. She killed them...and never turned them as far as the Watcher could tell.&quot;</P>
<P>The Slayer's eyes were closed, her expression twisted by revulsion. She'd heard worse in the course of her duties, but for some reason, she found this latest news more disturbing than most.</P>
<P>&quot;The Watcher tried to raise a group of locals to hunt her down, but by the time he managed, she'd disappeared. It's the last confirmed sighting in the journals...&quot; Willow snapped the book closed. &quot;Everything else in here is too general...too uncertain...to be of any use.&quot; She grabbed for a printout she'd set aside from the thick stack. &quot;I also found two related accounts of her possible activities that don't come from the Watcher journals.&quot; She reached behind herself, tapping a key to bring up a picture onscreen. It was a painting showing a pretty young woman, very naked, auburn hair flowing around her shoulders as she flinched away from two men leering over a low wall at her. &quot;The painting is <I>Susannah and the Elders</I>,&quot; she said by way of explanation.</P>
<P>Buffy's brows lifted. &quot;I'm assuming this relates somehow?&quot; she questioned after a beat.</P>
<P>Willow nodded. &quot;When Delaine was studying with Orazio, he was also teaching his daughter, Artemesia--she became a pretty well respected artist in her own right. About two years after this was painted, she was raped by another artist named Agostino Tassi. In court documents, he made various allegations about her moral character.&quot; Willow's tone signaled her disapproval of what she'd read. &quot;Among other things, he offered this painting as proof that Artemesia had had an 'unnatural relationship' with Delaine DuCourvallier and was an immoral and licentious woman.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy peered at the softly rounded features of the woman in the painting as she leaned closer to the screen, trying to commit every curve to memory. &quot;So this is her?&quot;</P>
<P>The hacker shrugged. &quot;I don't know for certain--it's not exactly well documented--but it's mentioned in several places and she...um...pretty much fits the descriptions I've found...except, well, hair color--she's always described as a blond--but that's pretty inconsequential.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Call me funny, but a rapist isn't my ideal information source,&quot; Buffy admitted uncomfortably after a long moment.</P>
<P>The hacker didn't argue as she continued. &quot;I know--and since he'd already spent time in jail for having incestuous relations with his sister-in-law and been accused of trying to have his wife murdered, there's considerable reason to doubt his word--but others had the same opinion...not that they had an unnatural relationship, but that Delaine DuCourvallier was the model for the painting. It was pretty scandalous at the time. I mean young ladies of good birth didn't appear naked in public--in paintings or otherwise.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy continued studying the piece, trying to imagine what the real life version of the figure would have looked like. Like most graphics on the web, it was fairly low resolution, leaving her wishing she could make out the details better. &quot;All right, so for the moment, we'll assume it's a decent likeness.&quot;</P>
<P>Willow grabbed another printout. &quot;In a related account, there's a mention in the records of the court of King Charles I of England, in the year 1641--Artemesia was in residence in the English court at the King's invitation--apparently, he served as patron to a number of artists. The country was on the verge of civil war and Artemesia was getting ready to leave to return to Italy, when she reported to the castle warden that she'd had a late night visitor--according to the documents, she was badly shaken, and insisted that Delaine DuCourvallier had called to her in her apartments, drawing her outside. She said the <I>ghost</I> told her that Tassi was dead.&quot;</P>
<P>The Slayer's expression was unreadable. &quot;Was he?&quot;</P>
<P>Willow nodded. &quot;Decapitated in a whorehouse in Naples two months before...which is ironic in view of the fact that, after the rape, one of Artemesia's favorite subjects was the biblical tale of Judith slaying Holofernes...by beheading him.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy's brows drew together, a neat line forming between them as she considered the information. Had the vampire DuCourvallier taken revenge on the part of someone the human DuCourvallier had known before dying? She'd never heard of vampire doing anything like that. In fact, they were far more likely to kill those they'd loved in life than those they hated. If it was true, this was not your average bite or fight vampire. &quot;Anything else?&quot; she asked after a long moment.</P>
<P>&quot;One other thing that might be relevant...&quot; Willow slowed, her tone becoming hesitant. &quot;For the most part, she doesn't seem to have had a lot to do with demons or vampires--at least not in any way that left them alive...or not <I>alive</I>, but mobile...you know what I mean--but there is a mention of one vampire she was supposedly seen with several times in Paris in the 1820's....&quot; Willow fell silent, her head bowed, visibly uncomfortable.</P>
<P>Which could have only one possible meaning in Buffy's experience. &quot;Angelus,&quot; she exhaled.</P>
<P>Willow nodded. &quot;Just for a short time...but...yeah....&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I wonder if she's the one who taught him how to draw?&quot; the Slayer exhaled wryly. Sometimes she wondered why it was the things that the demon had done had the power to hurt her. It hadn't been Angel, not her Angel. At least the pain wasn't anywhere near as sharp as it had once been. The months away from him had at least numbed her to the agony of thinking about his other life.</P>
<P>Willow's eyes were still downcast, and she took a deep breath, leaving Buffy with the distinct feeling she wasn't going to like what came next. She was right. &quot;I...um...I kinda thought maybe he'd know something that wasn't in the books....&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Will, you didn't...&quot; Buffy sighed.</P>
<P>The hacker sighed softly, signaling that she had. &quot;Well, I mean...I wasn't sure you'd feel comfortable calling...so...I called...he wasn't in...so I left a message...with Cordelia....&quot; Willow's tone made it plain that that had not been a fun moment. &quot;Are you mad at me?&quot; she asked in a tiny voice.</P>
<P>Buffy drew a deep breath, then exhaled a heavy sigh. &quot;No,&quot; she said at last. She reached out and patted Willow's shoulder. &quot;You're right...if he...he was...with her....&quot; Just getting the words out made Buffy nauseous. She massaged her temple, wishing she could make the headache suddenly pulsing behind her eyes go away. &quot;You did the right thing,&quot; she said after a beat.</P>
<P>Willow shrugged. &quot;Well, I just thought you should know...in case...y'know, in case he calls...so you won't be...surprised....&quot;</P>
<P>The Slayer nodded, then tipped her head forward, hiding her face in her arms where they were folded across the back of the chair. She was just tired of all of it; Watchers, Slayer, vampires, and most especially Vampire-Slayers. She was seriously considering just getting up and moving lock, stock, and barrel to Antigua--not for any particular reason, just because Antigua sounded better than Sunnydale at that point--when she heard the soft creak of Willow's chair.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm sorry if my calling Angel upset you,&quot; the hacker apologized.</P>
<P>&quot;Not your fault,&quot; Buffy mumbled without looking up. &quot;You just did what you thought was best.&quot; There was a long moment of pensive silence, and then Buffy felt warm hands land on her shoulders.</P>
<P>&quot;You must be exhausted,&quot; Willow murmured as she slowly began massaging her best friend's taut shoulders. She hadn't thought about it as she stood and reached out to work away Buffy's aches and pains just like she'd done so many times before, but this time she knew it was different the moment she made contact and felt Buffy tense under her hands. She froze almost instantly, suddenly self-conscious and uncertain whether stopping or continuing was likely to draw more attention to the situation. A dull flush sliding over her skin, she just stood there for a long moment, unmoving, but not breaking contact.</P>
<P>Buffy could feel her friend's apprehension, not to mention her own, but at the same time, it felt so right, so.... She couldn't think of a word, except maybe comforting. And familiar. <I>Deja Vu</I> all over again. And comforting and familiar suddenly had an irresistible allure. Consciously, she could attribute it to the myriad of times they'd touched each other over the years, the innocent hugs, friendly handholding, and comforting backrubs ... but ... somehow it felt ... different ... and not just because of what had happened between then. There was something else there as well; something she couldn't quite put her finger on. Buffy was still pondering the paradox when she felt Willow's hands break contact with her shoulders. &quot;Don't stop,&quot; she exhaled without thinking. In an instant, the air thickened with their mutual awareness. &quot;I mean...it feels...good....&quot; <I>Oh, that'll help break the tension</I>, Buffy derided herself. She kept her face hidden in her arms, blushing furiously as she kept trying to recover. &quot;Tense,&quot; she mumbled. &quot;My shoulders are ... tense and...it...helps....&quot; <I>Just quit while you're behind</I>, she silently chided herself. <I>Just sit here and enjoy and whatever you do, don't think. It's all okay, so long as you don't think</I>.</P>
<P>Willow swallowed hard, silently willing her hands to stop shaking. She'd done this plenty of times; massaging away the Slayer's multitude of aches and pains. Except, those times they hadn't spent the previous night making love, hadn't kissed and touched, and made each other cry out with need. It was all confusing, scary--and wonderfully exhilarating--like coming home after being away for too long. Her heart thumping in her chest, Willow lowered her hands to Buffy's shoulders, smoothing outward from the curve of her neck, pressing in with her thumbs in rhythmic strokes. Buffy had stripped off her jacket on entering and was wearing a simple tank top that left her neck, arms, and shoulders almost entirely bare, and Willow was very much aware of the texture of warm silk skin overlaying taut, steel- cabled muscles. She continued the firm, slow caresses, feeling Buffy's muscles relax and warm under her fingers, even as her mind kept summoning up memories of the tastes and textures of the Slayer's body.</P>
<P>Buffy felt her body relax and threaten to go limp as Willow continued massaging her neck and shoulders. &quot;Better than 'Magic Fingers,'&quot; she exhaled. In two days her emotions had been all over the map, but suddenly it was all forgotten. She was right where she wanted to be.</P>
<P>The hacker couldn't repress a smile as she pressed the heel of her hand into the center of Buffy's back, working it down the length of her spine. &quot;I aim to please,&quot; she exhaled as she continued kneading the Slayer's narrow back and shoulders, growing more comfortable with each stroke.</P>
<P>&quot;And you do,&quot; Buffy breathed, letting herself float while Willow took care of her. Emotional stress and 48 hours with very little sleep had left her on the verge of collapse, and the soothing massage was only making her more aware of how close to the limit she'd pushed herself. Long minutes passed while the Slayer enjoyed the gentle ministrations and seriously considered simply falling asleep where she sat. It felt perfectly natural when she lifted her hands, holding them up over her head in silent invitation. She didn't know if Willow would understand the unspoken signal--didn't even know if she understood it herself--but after a brief moment, she felt the warmth of slender fingers wrapping around her palms.</P>
<P>&quot;Buffy?&quot; Willow's voice was a gaspy, chokey version of its normal self that made Buffy smile in spite of everything. There was something so cute about nervous Willow. She gently tugged Willow's hands down, pulling the hacker's arms around her until she felt warm curves pressed against her back. The crimson tips barely brushed Buffy's bare shoulder as the hacker leaned forward until her lips were near the Slayer's cheek, their hair blending together in contrasting strands of red and blond.</P>
<P>&quot;You should get some sleep,&quot; the hacker whispered, her warm breath playing over the Slayer's cheek.</P>
<P>Buffy's eyes were closed as she nodded. &quot;Later,&quot; she breathed. It wasn't a conscious decision, just a natural progression from comfort and safety to need and desire. Still holding Willow's hands loosely in her own, Buffy rose gracefully, the movement toppling the chair. It fell the floor forgotten as the Slayer released her hold on Willow's hands, turning inside the comforting warmth of her arms before she had a chance to drop them to her sides. Then, reaching behind herself, she threaded her fingers with Willow's, holding the hacker's hands right where they were as she crossed the tiny distance that still lay between them. Her head canted one way, Willow's the other, and then their lips met, the kiss tender and trusting.</P>
<P>Soft, warm, the contrasting textures of sharp teeth, a rough tongue, and velvety lips, kisses trading back and forth until they were both gasping and shivering. &quot;The computer,&quot; Buffy groaned through the shared bonding of their lips. &quot;Needs to be...Offline.&quot; That was as responsible as she was capable of being at that moment, despite knowing that there were more productive things she could be doing to ready for the night ahead. More kissage followed, despite any good intentions. Lots more kissage.</P>
<P>&quot;Mmm, needs to be offline,&quot; Willow agreed long moments later, but they didn't separate, instead leaning harder into each other. &quot;... in a ... moment...&quot;</P>
<P>Opting for the direct route, the Slayer reached behind herself and simply yanked the phone cord out of the wall, not caring when the tiny plastic piece that usually snapped it tightly in place went spinning one way while the cord fell in the opposite direction. Willow, who normally would have gone spastic over such an event, barely glanced over. She had other things on her mind.</P>
<P>Clothes were peeled and dropped or tossed, buttons popped, collars pulled out of shape; whatever it took to remove them quickly as they made their way to the bed. Buffy landed on the bottom, steadying Willow's hips as the hacker came down over her, then opening her mouth to the soft lips that found hers again.</P>
<P>They kissed, touched, stroked, caressed, saying with their bodies what they couldn't see clear to say with words, releasing themselves to the passion that neither quite understood, not knowing of the cruel game played with thoughts and memories, understanding only that flesh seemed to comprehend what the mind resisted.</P>
<P>And as she arched over her lover, her skin glistening with a fine sheen of sweat, the Slayer felt more at peace than she had in months. Even knowing that she faced probable death in a few scant hours.</P>
