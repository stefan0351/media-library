<!-- It All Depends On Your Timing \ And Now...For Something Completely Different... -->

<p>Willow Rosenberg eyed the ingredients on the shelves of <i>The
Witches' Brew</i>--the newest supply store for the ambitious young wiccan in
Sunnydale--with a jaundiced eye, unhappy with their probable quality. There had been
several previous stores, but they'd all had problems of a demonic sort which left an open
market. Unfortunately, <i>The Witches Brew</i> was not living up to its predecessor's eye
to detail. Of course, in most towns, there isn't a lot of call for mandrake root and
ground toad's foot, but this was Sunnydale after all, your basic Southern California town
located right over a Hellmouth, a tunnel straight to the netherworld. &quot;So, is this
fresh?&quot; Willow called out to the young Goth-wannabe behind the counter. She sniffed
the contents of the package. &quot;Because it really doesn't smell right.&quot;</p>

<p>The girl looked up from her oh-so-black fingers nails and sighed
heavily as she set her file aside. &quot;Look, I told you, I don't know. The owner doesn't
tell me that stuff.&quot; She made a face and went back to her nails while Willow
seriously considered casting a spell that would turn them bright fuscia for life and
wouldn't let her paint them over. Before she had a chance to consider what might
constitute an appropriate incantation, somebody goosed her ribcage from behind. Willow
jumped straight up in the air with a noisy yelp.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, cutie,&quot; Buffy Summers' voice rang in Willow's ear as
she pivoted to find her friend grinning at her.</p>

<p>Caught by surprise, the hacker was momentarily at a loss for words,
then she snapped her mouth shut. &quot;Buffy,&quot; she squeaked a moment later, her sides
still tingling where the Slayer had tweaked her. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy shrugged a narrow shoulder. &quot;When Giles told me where you
were, I thought I should make sure you get back okay.&quot; She stuffed her hands in her
jacket pockets, striving not to look overly worried without much success. &quot;You know,
with Faith out there and everything, things are kind of dangerous right now...especially
for you,&quot; she added breathlessly. The Slayer couldn't forget that Faith had intended
to murder her friend. She'd nearly lost Willow to Angelus' madness. She wasn't going to
lose her to a psycho Slayer. &quot;So, I figured I'd walk you back.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow's lips curved in the faintest of smiles, incredibly warmed by
Buffy's caring. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said very softly. &quot;But I'm okay.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy's eyes were worried as she lifted a hand to brush her
fingertips along the curve of Willow's jaw, brushing shoulder length red hair back from
her face. &quot;You just need to stay that way, okay?&quot; she whispered, her voice rough
with emotion.</p>

<p>Willow nodded. &quot;Hey, how can I be anything else,&quot; she said
in an attempt at lightness. &quot;My best bud is the Slayer.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy's expression remained serious. &quot;I think that's more of a
hindrance than a help in the personal safety department. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't
have every psycho on the west coast trying to kill you.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow dismissed that comment with a snort. &quot;Please, this is
Sunnydale. We've both seen what I'd be if not for you,&quot; Willow pointed out, then
blushed bright red as she remembered that alternate version of herself. Sensual, sexual,
and profoundly predatory, she'd laid her eyes on Willow and been interested in a very
unique version of self-love. Willow shivered as she remembered the leashed power of her
vampire self. Despite her best efforts to force the thoughts away, she couldn't deny that
there had a been a moment--incredibly brief, but very real--when she'd been tempted.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Buffy exhaled, sounding shaken. &quot;You have a
point.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow glanced at her friend and found her blush deepening as she
noted the Slayer's expression. <i>&quot;And I think I'm kinda gay,&quot;</i> she'd said
that night, uttering the words that were a teen's worst nightmare, then shared that
guilty, <i>Oh God</i> look with Buffy. For just a brief second, she'd been sure they could
all see the truth, then Buffy had covered by insisting it was a vampire after all, giving
Angel a hard look when he might have argued. That had shut him up quickly enough, but it
wasn't like it could undo what had already been done; that dangerous game of spin the
bottle that had wound up with their tongue's halfway down each other's throats, their
hands touching bare flesh and drawing shudders of thick arousal.</p>

<p>Willow's blush intensified another notch as she remembered <i>that</i>
night--some two months before discovering her vampirish self was more open about her more
alternate thoughts and fantasies--they'd spent a night of heady erotic explorations. But
the next morning, in the cold light of day, they'd both agreed that it was just a one-time
thing. Self-conscious, uncertain of what it meant, scared of where it might lead, they'd
simply tacitly agreed that it <i>never</i> happened.</p>

<p>And never happened had worked surprisingly well, at least right up
until Willow discovered she looked better than okay in leather and it <i>had</i> happened,
and that--despite her best efforts--she still thought about it <i>happening again</i>. And
none of it was making her life any easier. Denial had always worked for Willow Rosenberg
and she missed its comforting presence in her life.</p>

<p>&quot;Will?,&quot; Buffy's worried voice interrupted her train of
thought, which was probably just as well as far as Willow was concerned. &quot;Are you
okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh, oh...yeah,&quot; the redheaded hacker and junior wiccan
muttered, then sighed heavily and turned back toward the shelf full of strange sounding
ingredients. She covered her momentary lapse in denial by grumbling, &quot;I'm just a
little worried about the quality of some of this stuff. I mean we're still not having any
luck in the de-ratifying and I'm starting to wonder if the quality of the ingredients has
anything to do with it, y'know what I mean?&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy smiled, though worry still lived in her eyes. She slipped an
arm through Willow's. &quot;Well, no, not really, I guess. I tend to defer that sort of
thing to you and Giles.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow looked over at her friend, her denial firmly in place once
again, or at least it was until she got a look at the sweet smile and worried look aimed
her way. <i>Down hormones</i>, she growled mentally as she felt her heart skip a tiny
beat. It was no fair of Buffy to go smiling at her like that when she was trying so hard
to forget seeing that exact same smile shining down at her between sweet kisses and soft--<i>Stop</i>
<i>that!</i> she snarled at her very unhelpful inner voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Will?&quot; Buffy called her back from that distant place in
her head yet again.</p>

<p>&quot;I just...um...&quot; Willow pulled her arm from where it was
linked with Buffy's to reach for several packets on the shelves in front of her. &quot;I
just...uh...have to get this stuff...&quot; she stammered, her voice unusually quavery
even for her. She grabbed the things she needed with hurried movements and paid for them
with hands that threatened to tremble, while the clerk grumbled and clicked her black
fingernails on the counter.</p>

<p>Finally, Willow had her things and they were leaving.</p>

<p>&quot;Can I just say how not impressed I am by the service in this
place?&quot; Buffy questioned rhetorically as they stepped onto the sidewalk outside.</p>

<p>Willow shrugged as she hitched her bag of supplies higher on her
hip. &quot;It's gotten worse since there's no competition in town.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Spike?&quot; Buffy questioned.</p>

<p>&quot;Spike,&quot; Willow confirmed. The blond vampire had eaten the
competition some months before, leaving Sunnydale and specifically Willow in something of
a lurch. After all, the kinds of things she used in casting spells weren't exactly
available at the local Kroger's. The niche had briefly been filled by a hole in the wall
shop run by a pleasant middle-aged former hippie who, unfortunately had been run out of
town when Buffy's Mom got taken in by Hansel and Gretel, who unfortunately happened to be
directly from hell. &quot;And also...well...your mom.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; the Slayer exhaled, sounding embarrassed.
&quot;Sorry about that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;S'okay. Your Mom wasn't the only one with a torch that
night.&quot;</p>

<p>They walked along quietly after that, Buffy alert to anything that
might be lurking in the night, while Willow trusted her friend to sense any coming
dangers.</p>

<p>&quot;Will?&quot; Buffy spoke as they entered a quieter part of
town.</p>

<p>Willow looked over, noting the way Buffy was staring off into space,
her expression pensive. &quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p>The Slayer glanced over at her friend, then turned her gaze back
toward the street ahead of them. &quot;Can I ask you a question?&quot;</p>

<p>Willow shrugged uncertainly, wondering why she felt a sense of
trepidation. &quot;I guess,&quot; she mumbled.</p>

<p>Buffy pulled up short, forcing Willow to do the same, and pivoted to
face her friend. &quot;Do you ever think about it?&quot; she abruptly blurted out.</p>

<p>Willow blinked in confusion. Usually she followed Buffy's sometimes
off the wall reasoning, but it wasn't happening this time. &quot;It?&quot; she repeated.
&quot;Um, I think clarity's a little lacking in the question.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy's face fell, then she drew a breath and tried again,
&quot;Yeah, I guess,&quot; she exhaled, sounding very uncertain and unBuffylike. She raked
a hand through her hair, scraping it back from her face. &quot;It's just that...&quot; she
trailed off as she stared hard at Willow. &quot;I've been thinking about that night--<i>That</i>
<i>night</i>,&quot; she repeated with added emphasis, staring at Willow until her friend's
eyes suddenly widened with comprehension.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; Willow exhaled as though struck. &quot;<i>That </i>night.&quot;
She looked and sounded scared.</p>

<p>Buffy nodded and drug her hand through her hair again. &quot;I know
we agreed not to talk about it--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That it didn't happen,&quot; Willow corrected automatically.</p>

<p>&quot;Right, that it didn't happen,&quot; the Slayer confirmed, her
eyes straying away from her friend for a long moment before coming back. &quot;But, Will,
it did...and I'm not sure...&quot; She fell silent again. &quot;I'm not sure sometimes
that denying it is the right thing.&quot; She finished the last syllables on a gasp, then
stood silently as though it had taken all of her courage to say those simple words.</p>

<p>Willow could feel color crawling up her skin again. &quot;Oh.&quot;
She didn't know what else to say. Her brain had gone completely and none-too-mercifully
blank.</p>

<p>Buffy let out a soft, ironic laugh. &quot;Well, I guess that answers
that question.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; Willow said instantly, regretting the impulse almost
as instantly. &quot;I mean...it's just...well, I mean....&quot; She saw her friend's hurt
and felt her stomach muscles clench. &quot;It's just....&quot; Buffy's expression was
subtly accusing, but the redhead screwed up her courage and bumbled on. &quot;This is
easier for you....&quot;</p>

<p>A pale brow lifted high on Buffy's forehead.</p>

<p>&quot;I mean, you're cool...not like me...&quot;</p>

<p>The Slayer's expression shifted to one of sympathy. <i>Willow's
raving inferiority complex strikes again</i>. &quot;Will, it's just as hard for me, you
know...just as scary too,&quot; the Slayer added under her breath. &quot;I mean you're
with Oz...I know that...he adores you and...but...well...I just....&quot; She shook her
head as she ran out of words again. After all, as far as she could tell, Willow and Oz
were batty about each other, yet sometimes, she felt so much closer to her friend than she
could imagine her feeling with anyone else.</p>

<p>Willow seemed startled by that admission. It had never occurred to
her that Buffy might be feeling shaken or uncertain. She was, after all, the Slayer;
confident, beautiful, supremely in control, and able to throw out a witty remark at the
slightest provocation. Willow, on the other hand, was...well...Willow. &quot;Oh.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy reached out to take Willow's free hand, holding it between her
palms. &quot;It's just that I've been thinking about it,&quot; the Slayer admitted in
halting syllables. She exhaled heavily in an effort to release stress, but it didn't work
very well. &quot;I've tried to ignore it...pretend it didn't happen, but it's not
working.&quot; Buffy fell silent, staring at Willow as though expecting her to say
something.</p>

<p>Willow's brain was still having a hard time catching up.
&quot;Oh.&quot; She took a deep breath and let it slowly, trying to marshal her shattered
composure. &quot;Buffy, I...&quot; Willow trailed off, suddenly uncertain exactly what
she'd intended to say.</p>

<p>The Slayer's expression was fast becoming stricken as she gauged her
friend's reaction as something akin to horror, rather than the totally overwhelmed that it
was. &quot;Look, just forget I said anything. I should have just--&quot; she muttered as
she started to turn away.</p>

<p>&quot;No, wait,&quot; Willow blurted and grabbed Buffy's arm,
tugging her back. &quot;It's not you,&quot; she said hurriedly. &quot;It's just...it's
like my brain's not working very well at the moment,&quot; the hacker explained, then
sighed heavily. She stared down at the ground between her feet, very much aware of the
watchful eyes studying her. She snuck a glance at her friend. &quot;I...&quot; She
couldn't think of a single thing to say.</p>

<p>&quot;Look, Will, you don't have to be nice, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not,&quot; Willow insisted in a shaky voice, then repeated
the statement. &quot;I'm really not. I--you just caught me by surprise.&quot; She saw the
look on the Slayer's face and quickly added, &quot;A good kind of
surprise...but...well...very surprising...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look, I probably shouldn't have sprung this on you this
way,&quot; Buffy said by way of apology. &quot;It's just been on my mind a lot
lately.&quot; She drew a little closer to her friend. &quot;I guess it's a side effect
of...everything...I mean, bad stuff's coming...you and I both know it...and...&quot; She
reached out to touch Willow's face with a gentle hand. &quot;I wanted you to know,&quot;
she whispered very softly, her voice choked with emotion. &quot;How much you mean to
me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; the name left Willow's lips on
a sigh as she stared into deep blue eyes, her boyfriend totally forgotten. They were
standing close, almost toe to toe. &quot;I've been thinking about it too,&quot; she
admitted, her voice little above a whisper. She slanted her head to one side, peering at
her friend from under her lashes. &quot;Lately, it's about all I've been thinking
about,&quot; she admitted breathlessly.</p>

<p>Buffy's head canted the opposite direction as she breathed her
friend's name, &quot;Willow.&quot; Then, very abruptly, she tensed, looking away into the
night.</p>

<p>Willow felt the change instantly. &quot;Buffy?&quot; she squeaked
nervously, noting that they were completely alone on the dark street.</p>

<p>&quot;Spidey sense is tingling,&quot; the Slayer clipped by way of
explanation as she drew a pair of sharpened wooden stakes from inside her jacket. She
passed one over to Willow with the brusque advice, &quot;Try to stay out of it.&quot; She
flashed a worried look at her friend. &quot;If it comes down to it, run.&quot; Then there
was no time for chatter as Spike and Drusilla appeared at one end of the street.</p>

<p>Buffy relaxed ever so slightly. The vampires' answer to Sid and
Nancy were a royal pain in the backside, but she knew their moves well enough to regard
them as little more than a middling threat. Buffy's expression became one of wry dislike.
&quot;I see you got your girlfriend back,&quot; she noted, then twitched as an odd scent
teased her nostrils. Good God, had a rendering plant gone in somewhere close?</p>

<p>Spike shrugged, looking almost uncomfortable, though he did grin for
a moment as he explained. &quot;I grabbed her, tortured, had a wonderful time...so all's
right with the world again.&quot; He wrapped an arm around Drusilla's waist, yanking her
against his side, where she draped her arms around his shoulders, crooning sweetly in his
ear.</p>

<p>&quot;One two, bash him with a shoe, three four slam him to the
floor, five six, stab him with sticks, seven eight now it's time to decapitate...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hush, Dru,&quot; Spike chastised and flattened a hand across
her mouth as he reminded her. &quot;This is business ... remember?&quot; He cautiously
took his hand away.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Drusilla agreed cheerfully.
&quot;Business.&quot; She pressed harder against Spike. &quot;I love it when you do <i>business</i>
for me,&quot; she drawled and licked crimson lips in a gesture of erotic promise and ran
her hands over his chest.</p>

<p>Spike caught a wandering hand. &quot;Not now, Dru,&quot; he said
shortly. &quot;It's really not a good time...what with the Slayer just over there and all.
I promise...I'll torture you later.&quot; She licked her lips again and he instinctively
leaned forward, momentarily caught in her spell.</p>

<p>&quot;Look, I don't mean to interrupt the love session, but is there
a purpose for this little reunion or can I just go ahead and get down to kicking your
asses?&quot; Her nose was still twitching like mad and the smell was only getting worse.
&quot;Geez, what is that stench?&quot; Her gaze locked on the vampire, noting the way his
expression went from Ozzie Nelson happiness back to shrugging uncomfortable-almost-guilt.
Buffy tensed again. Something was definitely going on. Drusilla tittered happily,
confirming her worries. &quot;So, Spike, I know you're dead, but really, is the eau de
corpse cologne absolutely necessary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey,&quot; Spike growled in response to the insult, &quot;I
use Aramis! If you must know, what you're smelling is--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, Buffy,&quot; Willow interrupted and tugged on her friend's
jacket sleeve. Willow had turned and was staring toward the other end of the street.</p>

<p>&quot;Him,&quot; Spike confirmed as the Slayer pivoted and saw what
was coming toward them. &quot;And just for the record,&quot; he added sulkily, &quot;this
wasn't <i>my</i> idea.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy's jaw hung open, a rare event after several years of slaying.
It was hard to find something that surprised her these days, but this creature definitely
made the grade. It was eight to nine feet tall with massive, knuckle dragging arms, a
scaly crimson hide that look like it could withstand a nuclear bomb, and an impressive
pair of curled ram's horns that topped its enormously ugly head. Buffy frowned suddenly as
she noted something else. Oh yeah, it was wearing gold chains around its neck, at least
one of which appeared to be sporting a shark's tooth. Great, not merely an extraordinarily
large ugly-ass demon, but an extremely large, ugly-ass demon with lame taste.</p>

<p>As if in response to the thought, the creature smiled, at least
Buffy thought the crack toothed expression that split slobbering lips was a smile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Man, you got some cute broads around here.&quot;</p>

<p>Great, not just a lamer demon, but a male chauvinist lamer demon.
Buffy was going to enjoy this.</p>

<p>The beast kept coming toward them. Buffy risked a glance back at
Spike and Dru, but they hadn't moved, though Spike looked like he'd like to. Judging by
the way his nose was wrinkling, away from the coming fight.</p>

<p>&quot;So,&quot; the beast drawled, its voice booming off the nearby
buildings as it did an obscene hip thrust that made Buffy all too aware of the fact that
gold chains were all it was wearing. &quot;Which one of you babes wants to fly to the moon
for your first time?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gods,&quot; Spike muttered under his breath. &quot;No wonder
he hasn't gotten in laid in ages.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy gripped her stake a little tighter and dropped into a
fighter's stance. &quot;I think I'll pass,&quot; she snarled. &quot;Since you don't look
like you'd send a girl much farther than East Sandusky.&quot;</p>

<p>The creature's head cocked to one side as he studied Buffy
carefully. &quot;Now, that's not going to do,&quot; he observed with perverse calm.
&quot;Yo...vamp-dude...what's the jive? I thought these chicks were s'posed to be, like,
totally cherry.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head in confusion. It was as though Keanu Reeves had
been demonized--and not during his Matrix period. No, this demon was pure <i>Bill and
Ted's Excellent Adventure</i>. She glanced over at her friend. Willow was gripping her
stake with one hand and rubbing her eye sockets with the thumb and forefinger of the other
as though she had a headache or a vision problem. &quot;Will?&quot; Buffy snapped
worriedly.</p>

<p>The redhead shook her head, then blinked as though trying to clear
her vision. &quot;I can't seem to keep things in focus....&quot; She shook her head again
and then there was no more time for discussion.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the distance, Drusilla sing-songed, &quot;A tisket, a
tasket, a Slayer's head in a basket.&quot;</p>

<p>While Spike called out to the advancing demon. &quot;It's the
redhead you want, you bloody idiot. The blond is the Slayer...also...she's the one who
shagged Angelus...er...Angel...er...whatever...&quot;</p>

<p>Another snaggle toothed grin. &quot;Kewl. I always have had a woodie
for reds.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now there's a detail I could have done without,&quot; the
Slayer grumbled under her breath, then glanced back at her friend, noting the way she was
still struggling with her vision. &quot;Stay out of it!&quot; she called out, then leapt
into the fray. The Slayer swung, ducked a fist that was roughly the size of a side of beef
and hammered on the thing with feet and fists.</p>

<p>&quot;Go 'way, girlie...you ain't no virgin,&quot; the creature
snapped impatiently and tried to shove her aside.</p>

<p>Buffy responded by slamming the stake in her hand into its chest
with all her might. Caught between the Slayer and a hard place, the wood crumpled into
little more than splinters without making a dent in rock hard flesh. Buffy tried to duck
the blow that followed, but couldn't move fast enough. It caught her in the chest, and
suddenly she was airborne. She hit a nearby wall hard and the world went black. As fights
go, it was a less than spectacular performance.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy!&quot; Willow shouted and rushed to her friend's side.
Blood trailed freely down the side of the blond's face, running into her hair and
following the line of her jaw down her throat and she was rag doll limp. Willow pressed
her fingers against the carotid artery in her throat and found her pulse beating strong
and steady. The hacker felt her own heart start beating again as she realized the damage
wasn't fatal and, the thankfully, The Slayer's head was notoriously hard. A thudding
footstep reminded her of their attacker, and Willow spun and rose in one move, brandishing
her sharpened stake in what she hoped was a threatening manner. She heard a thundering
chuckle, though she still couldn't force the thing into focus. &quot;Stay back,&quot; she
snarled. &quot;I know how to deal with vampires.&quot;</p>

<p>Another ear-drum pounding chuckle. &quot;That's nice...only one
problem girlie...&quot;</p>

<p>Willow's nose wrinkled and her eyes were tearing from the
gut-rotting stench. Still, she tried valiantly to project a Buffy-esque aura of
confidence. &quot;Oh yeah, and what would that be?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not a vampire. I'm an incubus--every man's nightmare and
every woman's fantasy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An incubus?&quot; the redhead repeated as she blinked away
tears while struggling not to gag on the air that was now fouled by the beast's breath.</p>

<p>&quot;That's right, my little redheaded cutie.&quot; A huge fist
clamped down on Willow's shoulder, nearly driving her to her knees.</p>

<p>The computer hacker reacted on pure instinct, turning into the
creature and hammering the stake in her hand into the general region of what had to be its
chest. Only the wood splintered in her hand, and the creature only laughed at her.</p>

<p>&quot;Man, that tickles...what're'ya tryin' to do with that l'il
thing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kill you before you kill me...and my friend?&quot; Willow
croaked.</p>

<p>The creature made a pshawing sound. &quot;Ah hell's breath, little
girl, I'm not here to kill you. I'm here to ring your bell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ring my--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I told you, babe, I'm an incubus,&quot; the creature griped.
&quot;Geez, doesn't anybody teach kids nothin' these days?&quot; He dragged her close, his
breath making her gasp for air as he whispered in what was apparently meant to be a suave
voice, &quot;I'm here to give you the ultimate sexual experience...make you cry out with
ecstasy...hear you beg and moan...&quot;</p>

<p>Willow still had the presence of mind for the bemused thought that
it might just be hard to do all of that if she was holding her breath, but didn't give
voice to the thought. After all, it--he--didn't seem angry or anything like that, no point
making him that way...especially while Buffy still lay unconscious. Somewhere in the
distance she could vaguely make out Drusilla's mad laughter and Spike's rather wry
whining. And while they were the least of her worries right at that moment, with Buffy out
of it, it would be all too like them to take advantage of her weakness. She had to think
clearly and carefully to have any chance of surviving. &quot;I won't let you hurt
Buffy,&quot; she insisted, though it was hard to imagine what she could actually do to
stop the thing.</p>

<p>The creature's laughter vibrated her from head to toe. &quot;I don't
want to hurt anybody...not my trip at all...I'm a lover, not a fighter,&quot; the creature
explained, his cadences somehow reminding her of an old Saturday Night Live
rerun...something about two wild and crazy guys, or maybe Keanu Reeves in that awful time
travel flick he'd done in the 80's--before mistakenly deciding he was a serious actor.
Suddenly, that thought was the last thing on Willow's mind as the thing grabbed her around
the waist and yanked her close, so that she was breast to chest with a massive torso.
&quot;And I do love you my little redheaded sex goddess.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow didn't even have time to notice that being close hadn't
improved her focus at all. She was too busy passing out as his breath washed over her.</p>

<p>The incubus chuckled good-naturedly and cuddled her close.
&quot;Man, you are an excitable little luv bunny, aren't you?&quot; He used a massive hand
to pet silky red hair back from the girl's face, still ignoring the vampires.</p>

<p>Drusilla tittered as she stared down at the unmoving Slayer, then
launched into a fresh round of rhyming; this time a limerick;</p>
<i>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;There once was a Slayer got knocked on the head<br>
  Then was decapitated and found herself dead.<br>
  She went off to hell with a scream and a wail.<br>
  While an ugly old incubus got her little friend's tail.&quot;</i></p>

<p>Then the vampire started to lean toward the unmoving girl, her eyes
bright with lust. After all, Angelus had had this girl, had loved her enough to want to
drive her mad.</p>

<p>&quot;You go, Dru,&quot; Spike encouraged her. &quot;Gonna bag
yourself a Slayer.&quot; Though, oddly, there was a touch of reserve in his voice, as
though he wasn't quite as thrilled as he ought to have been over the death of another
Slayer.</p>

<p>Of course, in the end, it didn't really matter whether he was
reserved or not. Drusilla leaned close, licking her lips hungrily as she neared the limp
young woman.</p>

<p>And then suddenly, she went flying, backhanded by a crimson fist the
size of a Chevy Impala. The vampire hit the street, rolled with the force of the blow and
came up to her feet, features twisted by the face of the demon inside of her. Spike's
features instantly shifted, revealing the demon that hid inside his once human body.
&quot;What the hell do you think you're doing?&quot; he demanded of the creature that had
just belted his girlfriend hard enough to make her head spin--or in Drusilla's case, to
make it stop spinning for a moment.</p>

<p>The incubus turned toward the vampire, reptilian eyes narrowing to
mere slits as he slung the girl up higher in his arms. &quot;Dude, I don't go in for
unconscious little girls.&quot;</p>

<p>Spike shook his head, not quite believing what he was hearing.
&quot;Are you daft?&quot; he snarled. &quot;That girl's a <i>Slayer</i>...an <i>unconscious</i>
Slayer...now's the perfect time to--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's a chick...a babe...a skirt...and I'm an incubus,
fang-boy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What the hell?&quot; Gods, this was all Drusilla's fault. He
felt her press against his side and reached out, yanking her close. <i>I'd torture her for
this whole mess</i>, he thought unhappily, <i>if she didn't enjoy it so much</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't kill girls...got it?&quot;</p>

<p>Spike considered several responses and discarded them all.
&quot;You're a demon,&quot; he pointed out with professional pride. &quot;We're <i>all</i>
demons.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't hit girls,&quot; the incubus insisted mutinously.</p>

<p>&quot;You just hit Dru!&quot; Spike exclaimed. &quot;And you're the
one who knocked the bloody Slayer unconscious in the first place! And when you're done
with the bloody redhead, you'll have turned her into a succubus!&quot;</p>

<p>The incubus just shook its head dismissively. &quot;Your
girlfriend's a demon--in case you hadn't noticed--she likes that sort of thing and I only
hit the blond cos she whacked me with her stake. And, as for being a succubus, I have it
on excellent authority that it's good work if you can get it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't believe this,&quot; Spike complained, suddenly wishing
he'd never even heard of Sunnydale. Things like this had never happened before he came to
this accursed little town. There was nothing redeeming in the whole bloody place...except
maybe the Slayer's mum. He'd rather liked her. She even gave him the little marshmallows
he liked. One day when he was feeling in need of a mum again, he supposed he might just go
back there and have a go at her...though, if a demon took over her body, it might not be
quite as amenable to the whole marshmallow thing. Spike was still contemplating the
problem when the incubus suddenly cleared his throat, drawing the vampire's attention back
to his massive form.</p>

<p>&quot;Look, are we gonna stand here all night, or are we going to
return your charming little abode?&quot; the creature demanded, his breath once again
washing over Spike and reminding him of another reason this was all a very bad idea.
Demon's Breath, the city dump was going to smell better than the abandoned building they
were holed up in after another day of that beast's presence.</p>

<p>&quot;Fine,&quot; Spike growled at last. &quot;We'll go back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I thought we were going to kill a Slayer,&quot; Drusilla
complained and leaned against Spike, playing with his hair as she rubbed her teeth against
his throat.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, luv...not tonight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, maybe you could take in a movie,&quot; the incubus
suggested as it took off in the direction of the warehouse. &quot;I hear that <i>Titanic</i>
flick is supposed to be pretty good...everybody in hell's been a Billy Zane fan since that
Demon Knight flick he did. Did a nice job of playing a demon in that one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh demons, anything but that,&quot; Drusilla exclaimed in a
brief and rare moment of coherency. &quot;He always cries during the ending--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not!&quot; Spike swore.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha,&quot; Drusilla tittered. &quot;Right during the
end...glub, glub, glub...and there you are blubbering right along.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do not!&quot; Spike continued to insist as the small group
disappeared into the darkness.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</p>

<p>&quot;You've got to survive, Rose,&quot; the voice growled
insistently in her ear.</p>

<p>&quot;I keep telling you my name's not Rose,&quot; Buffy mumbled,
wishing fervently that Leonardo DeCaprio would just leave her the hell alone, but he just
couldn't seem to get the fact that he wasn't her type. &quot;Look, bud, I'm not
interested, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>A second later, Buffy Summers couldn't remember exactly who it was
she wasn't interested in as she pushed into a sitting position, groaning softly as she
massaged her sore head. Suddenly, her chin snapped up, eyes hunting the darkness
desperately. &quot;Willow?&quot;</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>No sign of Willow.</p>

<p>Spike and Drusilla and that...<i> thing</i>....had taken her. Buffy
bounded to her feet with surprising grace for someone who'd only just regained
consciousness. Despite the throbbing pain in her skull and a knee that refused to work
quite right--leaving her with a lingering limp--she reconned the area, hoping against hope
to find Willow nearby and unconscious, terrified that she might find her nearby and
already dead, her blood drained to feed Drusilla's desperate hunger. She was still
searching when a hiss came at her out of the darkness.</p>

<p>&quot;Pssst, little girl....&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy pivoted sharply, automatically dropping into a fighter's
stance as she demanded, &quot;Who's there?&quot;</p>

<p>Then it stepped from the shadows. For the briefest second, Buffy
thought big 'n' ugly was back, but on second look, she realized that where the first demon
had been large, red, scaly, and distinctly male--very distinctly male--this one was
definitely female--very, very female. In fact, she was the sort of female usually only
seen in the pages of comic books designed to appeal to very hormonally active fourteen-
year-old males. Though, on the balance, she was still large, red, scaly, and more than a
little ugly. Buffy felt her pulse pick up. After all, the male version had totaled her in
a few seconds. &quot;Well, well, if it isn't tall, red 'n' ugly...y'know, honey, plastic
surgeons can work wonders these days. You should schedule an appointment.&quot;</p>

<p>A slanted gold eyebrow climbed high on a crimson scaled forehead,
drawing Buffy's eyes to the almost delicate pointed horns that graced the edge of her
hairline. The voice that responded was honey smooth, though the breath that went with it
could kill a goat at fifty paces.</p>

<p>&quot;Y'know, darlin', you catch more flies with honey than
vinegar,&quot; the demon pointed out, her pose still relaxed.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow, such sage advice...let me guess, you read Dear Abby every
day,&quot; Buffy snarled.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; the demon chuckled, &quot;though I <i>was</i> once
her fill-in columnist--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where's Willow?&quot; the Slayer demanded, ending any pretense
of banter as she prepared to start throwing punches.</p>

<p>The creature tut-tutted, waving a very long black nail back and
forth. &quot;You mean the little redheaded tart?&quot; Something dangerous flashed in
reptilian eyes. &quot;Oh, she's what I need to talk to you about...because,&quot; the
creature drawled, those eyes glittering with enraged lights, &quot;if she touches Melvin,
I'm going to take great pleasure in skinning her alive.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Melvin?&quot; Buffy repeated, completely nonplused.
&quot;Who's Melvin?&quot;</p>

<p>The she-demon punched a finger in the air to make her point as she
swore, &quot;Do you think I don't know how much women want him...my God, give me credit
for <i>some </i>intelligence--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait,&quot; Buffy broke in. &quot;Just wait one
minute....&quot; She trailed off for a moment, running over the possible identities for
the dreaded, irresistable-to-the-female-half-of-the-population, Melvin, and could only
come up with one likely answer, but that was...was just...nope...her brain strongly
resisted the whole concept. &quot;Er,&quot; she began cautiously at last, while the
she-demon stood rapidly tapping the toe of a spike healed pair of fuzzy pink mules. For a
moment, Buffy's eyes were drawn irresistibly to the fashion nightmare, before she
marshaled her scrambled brain cells and continued. &quot;Melvin...he wouldn't happen to be
a large, 10 foot, red guy with horns and a...um...shark's tooth type necklace?&quot;</p>

<p>The sparkles took on a whole new light as the she-demon sighed.
&quot;That's him...every demoness' fantasy,&quot; before they flashed dangerously again.
&quot;Which is why your little friend is in serious trouble if anything happens between
them during the festival of Nagortathislaugenilfbaum.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Festival of Nagortathislaug...&quot; Buffy actually made
it halfway through before she resorted to finishing it off with,
&quot;whoseewhatsis?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right. Which means you've got until tomorrow at
midnight to explain to your friend why stealing another woman's demon is a <i>very </i>bad
idea.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy was still on a very witty and brilliant &quot;Umm,&quot; when
the thing disappeared in a burst of light and smoke that left her gagging and coughing and
nearly knocked her unconscious again. Tomorrow, she realized as she gasped for air. <i>I
only have until tomorrow night.</p>
</i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Rupert Giles glanced at his watch again, not the first time in the
hour and a half since Buffy had gone after Willow. It wasn't that he was especially
worried; at least not yet. After all, Buffy was the Slayer and quite capable of taking
care of both herself and Willow. It was just that--</p>

<p>&quot;So, how's it hanging, Giles?&quot; Xander Harris interrupted
the thought as he slapped Giles on the shoulder in what was meant to be a comradely way.
&quot;Since the girls are running late, maybe we guys should just go out on the town, pick
up a few chicks...&quot;</p>

<p>It was just that Xander's attempts at being friendly were driving
him slightly insane. Giles glared pointedly at the hand resting his shoulder, his wintry
look silencing the boy.</p>

<p>But only briefly. After all, it was Xander. &quot;Or...not...&quot;
he allowed, then turned an overbroad grin toward the ever-laconic Oz. &quot;How about you,
Oz? What say we paint the town red...might feel good after spending the last few nights as
a werewolf.&quot;</p>

<p>The bass player tensed, his expression frosty, at least for Oz--he
hated being reminded that he was a werewolf--and shook his head. &quot;I don't think
so,&quot; he murmured, his voice cool.</p>

<p>Xander paced, burning off only a scant trace of his excess energy.
Not having a girlfriend wasn't going over well at all. He was being even more annoying
that his usual self.</p>

<p>Giles was just about to suggest to Xander that he go on home, since
they'd already found all of the research needed and other than Giles, only Buffy and
Willow were required for the ceremony; yet another attempt at turning the entirely
ratified Amy human once more. He never got the chance.</p>

<p>Buffy came stumbling through the swinging doors that opened into the
library. She was favoring one leg and breathing hard. She didn't have to say anything for
them to know something was very wrong, her expression said it all.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy, what is it? What's happened?&quot; Giles demanded, then
pulled up short, noting that she was alone. &quot;Willow?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They got her,&quot; Buffy said instantly. &quot;Spike and
Drusilla...and some giant red monster...the thing knocked me out before I could do
anything....&quot;</p>

<p>Both Xander and Oz were perfectly silent, staring wide-eyed at the
Slayer, shock paralyzing them both.</p>

<p>Even Giles couldn't think straight. As close as he was to Buffy,
sometimes he felt like he understood Willow better; the serious, quiet student who
desperately wanted to be wild and unrestrained. Sometimes, he feared for her; that she
might let go and give way to that urge to defy society. He knew how dangerous that
temptation could be. He resisted the urge to drag a hand through his hair or bark orders.
Losing control wouldn't help anyone right now. He was quite grateful that Wesley was
nowhere in attendance since Buffy's Official Watcher's presence tended to drive him even
crazier than Xander. At least Xander cared about his friends. His heart was in his throat
as he croaked, &quot;Is she...&quot; he couldn't finish the sentence, but Buffy knew what
he was asking.</p>

<p>&quot;No...at least, I don't think so...there was some giant red guy
with Spike and Dru...his girlfriend showed up afterward....&quot; Oz grabbed a chair and
slid it into place beside Buffy, who sank onto it with a grateful sigh, her battered body
already healing, but hurting nonetheless. &quot;After I woke up,&quot; Buffy clarified as
she massaged her sore temple. She winced as she tried to remember the confusing array of
details. &quot;She was large, horns, red skin, big...&quot; Buffy held her hands in front
of her chest in an evocative gesture. &quot;She said something about tomorrow at midnight
and the festival of Naga...no, that's not it... Nagorta... Nagortalessalog...something
like that...only with a lot more syllables...it was one way long word...the monster with
Spike and Drusilla was the same, large, red, big-ass horns on that one...and it was
male...very, very male...nakedly so, in fact.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Red...with horns...like ram's horns?&quot; Giles questioned
and made a gesture up over his head. &quot;Curled and black?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, that's it,&quot; Buffy confirmed. &quot;You know what it
was?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And a fierce stench...like rotting meat or--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Please, rotting meat's a trip to the perfume counter next to
that thing.&quot; Buffy leaned her head back. &quot;I think she said his name was
Melvin,&quot; she mumbled, but Giles was already moving, grabbing for his books and
flipping through pages as fast as he was able.</p>

<p>&quot;Melvinathoraxisthulixis,&quot; the librarian muttered to
himself.</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head. &quot;No, I'm sure she just said Melvin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if your name was ...what Giles just said,&quot; Xander
said when he couldn't get his tongue around the word, &quot;you'd probably just go by
Melvin too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There,&quot; Giles said suddenly, and crossed to Buffy,
holding out the book so she could see a wood cut of a giant horned monster. &quot;Is that
it?&quot; he questioned.</p>

<p>Buffy studied the image for only a moment before nodding.
&quot;That's it. That's the thing that took Willow.&quot;</p>

<p>Giles nodded and pulled the book back, skimming through the
information contained on the antique pages. &quot;That means we have until tomorrow night
to get Willow back and banish that creature back to the netherworld.&quot; He continued
reading, obviously hunting for something.</p>

<p>&quot;That's what she said...what happens then?&quot; Buffy demanded
sharply, bringing her Watcher's head back up.</p>

<p>Giles looked embarrassed, his brow wrinkling with worry lines.
&quot;Because tomorrow night, they'll perform a ceremony to celebrate the Festival of
.Nagortathislaugenilfbaum...when it will...claim...Willow...and the resulting energy will
free the staff of Eldrad,&quot; Giles explained in choppy syllables. &quot;Which will give
Spike and Drusilla the power to walk in daylight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But it's the <i>creature</i> that took Willow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but at Spike and Drusilla's behest. They must have
summoned him. Melvinathoraxisthulixis is an incubus. The Staff of Eldrad is trapped in an
alternate realm. They must plan on having the incubus claim Willow to open the doorway so
they can retrieve the damn thing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And claimed means exactly what?&quot; Buffy demanded raggedly,
knowing instinctively it wasn't good.</p>

<p>Oz's jaw muscles clenched. &quot;It means he'll rape her.&quot; The
bass player's hands fisted at his sides and expression of fury briefly crossed his face
before his features resettled into his normal expression of bland indifference. Since his
entrance into the realm of otherworldly creatures, he'd spent some time reading up.</p>

<p>Giles flushed, while Buffy and Xander both stared goggle-eyed at
their friend for a moment, before swinging their heads in tandem toward the librarian.</p>

<p>&quot;Giles?&quot; Buffy prompted, her voice thick with horror. No
way was she going to let that happen. That was just not an option.</p>

<p>Giles shook his head jerkily. &quot;Umm, no....that's not strictly
true...technically, he will <i>seduce </i>her--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No way,&quot; Xander inserted, then when all eyes swung his
way, quickly added, &quot;I mean, Will's not what you'd call the seduceable type.&quot;
Several gazes narrowed, and the teen looked nervous. &quot;Not that I'd know personally or
anything like that--okay, I'll shut up now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It won't be seduction in the human sense,&quot; the librarian
explained, pointedly ignoring Xander. &quot;She won't be able to resist the demon's wiles.
She'll be drawn to him and it will change her. Unless his hold is broken, she <i>will</i>
go him willingly.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy snapped to her feet, shaking her head. &quot;I don't believe
that...Will wouldn't--&quot;</p>

<p>Slayer and Watcher were standing close now, speaking as though the
others in the room weren't there. &quot;Buffy, she won't have a choice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then it's goddamned rape,&quot; the Slayer swore furiously.</p>

<p>Giles frowned, not quite understanding the sheer intensity of
emotion in his charge's expression. &quot;Either way, she won't be able to resist,&quot;
he said softly, his low voice firm.</p>

<p>Buffy's muscles were taut as she resisted the urge to act instantly
with only the utmost effort. &quot;Then we get her back,&quot; she whispered, her voice
ragged.</p>

<p>&quot;It's not that simple,&quot; Giles said carefully.</p>

<p>&quot;It never is,&quot; Buffy growled. &quot;But that's what we're
going to do.&quot; She turned away as if to leave, but Giles' sharp voice halted her in
place.</p>

<p>&quot;We can't simply take her...not and expect her to live.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy pivoted back around. &quot;All right, I'm listening.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's marked her...laid a supernatural claim. If we don't
perform the proper ceremony to break his hold, separating them will kill her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So we do the ceremony,&quot; Oz said simply.</p>

<p>&quot;And we get her back,&quot; Xander added with equal
determination. Their brief flirtation with being something beyond inseparable friends
might have passed, but they were still lifelong buds, and he would die for her in a
heartbeat.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; Giles confirmed. &quot;But there are
things....&quot; He trailed off, pausing to strip off his glasses and begin polishing them
in a nervous gesture. He glanced back and forth between the two teenaged boys standing
ready to rescue their friend. &quot;There are two distinctly different ceremonies. Perform
the wrong one, and we'd lose her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, the wrong one kills her,&quot; Buffy rasped. &quot;How do
we know which is the right one?&quot;</p>

<p>Once again, the Watcher's gaze swung between the two boys.
&quot;Normally I wouldn't ask this,&quot; he began. &quot;But under the circumstances,
it's imperative to know the truth.&quot; His eyes hardened. &quot;The absolute
truth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; Oz responded, his tone flat.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, would I lie?&quot; Xander demanded and got several raised
eyebrows in response. Quickly, he amended the answer, &quot;I mean about anything
important?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just say it,&quot; Buffy clipped, her eyes hard on her
Watcher.</p>

<p>&quot;I need to know if Willow is still a virgin...if either of you
has...well...if either of you has ....&quot; A half a dozen facial ticks and a very clean
pair of glasses later, he cleared his throat and started to continue, but Buffy held up a
hand stopping him.</p>

<p>&quot;We get the idea,&quot; she said simply.</p>

<p>It was Oz who answered first. &quot;We haven't,&quot; he told the
librarian. &quot;We've talked about it...even...&quot; He paused and shook his head.
&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>Giles' gaze swung over to touch on Xander, who was blushing
furiously. &quot;No,&quot; the teen yelped guiltily, then intentionally lowered his voice
as he insisted, &quot;Never.&quot; His eyes darted nervously to where Oz was watching him
with his particularly intense gaze. &quot;Okay, there was a kiss. I admit that, but
nothing more...really. I swear, I never touched her.&quot;</p>

<p>It was Buffy who put him out of his misery. &quot;He's telling the
truth. She told me.&quot;</p>

<p>Xander flashed a nervous glance at Oz, whose expression was still
perfectly unreadable, though Xander fancied he could see the guitarist's lips pulling back
from his teeth in the beginnings of a snarl. He pulled at his collar as he turned a
grateful look on the Slayer. &quot;You have no idea how thankful I am to hear you say
that,&quot; he whimpered. Oz wasn't especially thrilled with him at the best of times, and
he was sure he wasn't imagining the fact that as a werewolf, it was Xander Oz seemed most
intent on taking a bite out of.</p>

<p>Buffy's eyes met Giles. &quot;All they ever did was kiss,&quot; she
told him, her tone flat.</p>

<p>Giles stared at the teen, searching her eyes as though he might find
an answer to a question he wasn't even sure was there to be asked. Suddenly, he
straightened and reached back for the book where he had laid it on the table. &quot;Yes,
well, that makes things much easier,&quot; he muttered, sliding back into his familiar
role as the faintly flummoxed librarian. &quot;The ceremony is relatively simple...a few
incantations and the proper herbs. Xander, I'll write up a list of what we need--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's me,&quot; Xander piped in. &quot;I'm herb guy...just
tell me what we need and herbs we shall have....&quot; He knew he was babbling, but the
whole situation had thrown his equilibrium.</p>

<p>Buffy watched silently as Giles read through the ingredients listed
in the book, barely controlling the urge to get out and move, hunt, bring home her best
friend. Her eyes met Oz's. He was having the same problem, though it was less obvious in
his case. He frowned slightly, the tiniest of creases forming between his brows. She saw a
flicker of something akin to realization in his expression. They were feeling the same
things, the same desire to protect, and God help her, the same love. Buffy raked a hand
through her hair as an image of Willow stretched out below her on her bed flashed in her
mind. Dear God, what if.... She couldn't even finish the thought. She didn't think they'd
done anything that might qualify, but it wasn't as simple as with a guy, where there was a
distinctive cutoff point. Do this, you're over the line, don't do that, you're safe. This
was nowhere near that simple and she'd never seen any rules to cover this situation.</p>

<p>And what if she was wrong and what they'd done did qualify? Then
Willow was dead.</p>

<p>Buffy closed her eyes momentarily. It was a chance she couldn't
take. &quot;Giles,&quot; she rapped out as she opened them again. She didn't want to just
announce her worries, but he had to know. The excuse slipped from her lips in an instant.
&quot;We were in <i>The Witches' Brew</i> earlier and Willow was worried about some of the
stuff they're stocking. We need to talk about it.&quot; She nodded toward his office,
hinting that she meant privately, but Giles' full attention was focused on the list he was
building.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure it will be fine. These are all pretty simple
ingredients.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; Buffy disagreed. &quot;It could be important. We
need to discuss it. <i>Now</i>,&quot; she added sharply, her tone bringing his head up.
&quot;She was <i>very</i> worried,&quot; Buffy said now that she had his attention.
&quot;I think we should discuss it in your office.&quot; She knew Xander and Oz were
watching the exchange, and they had to be picking up on the weirdness of the conversation,
but couldn't do anything to change it. &quot;<i>Now</i>,&quot; she repeated, silently
sending Giles the message that she meant it.</p>

<p>The librarian nodded abruptly and snapped the book shut on the index
card he was using as a marker. &quot;Yes, perhaps that would be best,&quot; he murmured.</p>

<p>A moment later, they were ensconced in Giles' small office. Buffy
was facing the far wall as she heard the door latch. She took a breath, not waiting before
she told him, half afraid she might chicken out. &quot;It's Willow...the virginity
thing...she might not be one.&quot; The words came out in a stuttering jumble.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Giles murmured, his tone gently sympathetic. He
knew the girls were close, that Buffy might well know things the boys didn't. &quot;I
rather guessed as much.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy folded her arms under her breasts as she stared at his degrees
where they hung on the wall. &quot;It's just that...&quot; she trailed off, not certain
how to phrase what had to be said.</p>

<p>Giles frowned, his expression compassionate. &quot;Buffy, whatever
you know, you need to tell me...&quot; He took a deep breath and let it out slowly.
&quot;If something happened to Willow...something you know about, it's imperative we know
the truth...you must know that whatever it is, neither I nor any of Willow's friends will
think any less of her.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy pivoted, her eyes going wide as she shook her head. &quot;God
no...I'm not saying that,&quot; she exhaled heavily. &quot;It's...I don't know how
to....&quot; She shook her head, at a loss for words.</p>

<p>&quot;If there was some other boy...other than Xander or
Oz....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How important is it, you know, whether she is or isn't?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of the utmost importance,&quot; Giles answered very seriously.
He took a deep breath before explaining, &quot;If we can't rescue Willow in time she'll be
devoured by the demon whether Spike gets the staff or not...he'll remake her as a
demon...&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy flinched, her hold on her midsection tightening. Willow, a
demon? She wasn't sure she could live with herself if that happened.</p>

<p>&quot;If we perform the ceremony to release a maiden wrongly,
Melvinathoraxisthulixis will be freed into the world to devour women's souls at
will.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy ran a hand through her hair, gnawing on her inner cheek as she
tried to formulate some kind of response. &quot;What about the other one?&quot; she asked
at last. &quot;What if we do that and she's still technically...&quot; she trailed off
meaningfully.</p>

<p>&quot;According to the texts, Melvinathoraxisthulixis will be
banished back to hell--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fine,&quot; Buffy broke in hopefully. &quot;Then we do that
one--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; Giles cut her off. &quot;Because if it's not the
right ceremony, even it banishes the demon, it would kill Willow.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy's breath caught in her throat, and she had to swallow hard to
keep her dinner down.</p>

<p>&quot;So you see, you have to tell me what you know...if need be, we
can contact him quietly...find out the answers we need...I can even hypnotize him if
doesn't want to--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is no him,&quot; Buffy forced out.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; Giles chided. &quot;It's obvious there was
someone. If you know who it is, give me his name.&quot;</p>

<p>The Slayer shook her head. She'd already traded the Box of Gavrock
and possibly the future of the world to save Willow. She would trade anything. What was a
little personal embarrassment? &quot;Don't you understand, Giles?&quot; she demanded while
he stared at her, still plainly confused. &quot;It's me.&quot;</p>

<p>His jaw dropped and for a moment, he couldn't think to respond. His
jaw worked momentarily, no sound coming out until he took another deep breath and tried
again. &quot;I see.&quot; He ran a hand through his hair. &quot;If it's...I...then why
don't you know?&quot; he questioned logically, feeling totally flummoxed by this new piece
of information.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's not as simple...it's...I...I don't know,&quot; the
Slayer babbled uncertainly, her skin heating as she remembered the things they'd done, the
way they'd made her feel. God, none of it was simple. &quot;We...one night things got out
of control...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Obviously,&quot; Giles said dryly, then exhaled a heavy sigh.
&quot;What did you do?&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy turned a horrified gaze his way, unable to believe he'd asked
that question.</p>

<p>&quot;If you think I want to know, think again,&quot; he growled
unhappily. &quot;But under the circumstances...well, perhaps I can answer the question...I
mean about...&quot; He paused for a long moment, debating his words before continuing.
&quot;The issue at hand.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy turned away, squaring her shoulders before she began giving
the details in the flattest, most clinical way imaginable. After she finished the halting
uncomfortable recitation, she glanced back over her shoulder, making eye contact with her
very discomfitted Watcher. &quot;Well?&quot; she questioned, her voice
uncharacteristically small.</p>

<p>Giles sighed softly and shook his head, visibly uncertain. &quot;I
don't know,&quot; he admitted. &quot;It's not really a situation I've run into
before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that was a study in useless personal
embarrassment,&quot; the Slayer said dryly, then growled a soft curse under her breath.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy, we've got to know and I'm not certain what the answer
is.&quot;</p>

<p>The Slayer speared him with a sharp look. &quot;Well, unless you
know of a book that deals with these sorts of questions, I don't have any brilliant
suggestions.&quot; She ran a hand through her hair. &quot;We'll just have to figure
something out. In the meantime, get the supplies together for both ceremonies while I find
where they've got her, since the rest is all academic until we know that much.&quot; It
was time to deal with one problem at a time. Find Willow, and then figure out how to free
her. The Slayer squared her shoulders once again. She couldn't afford to lose Willow. Not
now, not ever.</p>

<p>Giles nodded. &quot;All right,&quot; he agreed then paused for a
long moment, carefully studying his young charge, noting her barely leashed energy with a
raised brow. &quot;Buffy,&quot; he began. &quot;Perhaps you're too close to this
situation,&quot; he suggested at last.</p>

<p>The Slayer's answering laugh was grim. &quot;More than a
little,&quot; she allowed, too involved in her own thoughts to notice the worried look on
her mentor's face. &quot;But we both know that I'm the only chance she has.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do suggest you speak to Angel. He may have some suggestions
about where Spike and Drusilla might be hiding.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy's shoulders shook with dark humor, but she nodded.
&quot;Right...Angel...you're right of course,&quot; she agreed after a brief pause.
&quot;He might be able to help find them...&quot; The last thing she wanted to think about
at that moment was her on again, off again, never again to be consummated relationship
with Angel. They'd been allies, lovers, enemies, and now they were none of those things,
leaving her uncertain exactly what they <i>were</i>. All she knew for certain was that her
feelings about him hadn't been the same since his return from hell, but they were still
close enough that she knew he would help her however he could. And at that moment, she
needed him to help her find Willow. She moved to step past her Watcher, but his voice
caught her before she could exit his office.</p>

<p>&quot;You do realize, I hope, that the most imperative matter is
that Spike and Drusilla are prevented from gaining the staff and Melvinathoraxisthulixis
isn't freed into the world.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy's eyes met his, her expression resentful. &quot;Have I let the
world come to an end yet?&quot; she asked without specifically answering his question.</p>

<p>He faced her glare with an oddly sad look. &quot;No...of course
not...but, Buffy...you...&quot; he trailed off and fell silent for a long moment before
simply saying, &quot;Be careful...I'll get things ready here.&quot;</p>

<p>The Slayer nodded and hurried out. He heard the soft sounds as she
bid farewell to Xander and Oz. After she had gone, Rupert Giles dragged a hand through his
hair, his voice low as he exhaled, &quot;Dear God, what am I supposed to do now?&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Willow Rosenberg groaned softly and rolled over, her body aching
painfully. Her groan deepened as a hideous stench flooded her nostrils. &quot;Aw
God,&quot; she moaned and pushed upright, her all too unfocused gaze going to the large
red blob not very far away before moving on to touch on her surroundings. &quot;It wasn't
a nightmare.&quot; She was lying on some kind of low slung cot in a large, high ceilinged
room lit only by a single lightbulb hanging on a bare chain. A sulfurish odor assaulted
her nose and she seriously considered fainting again if only to escape the gut ripping
smell, but discarded the idea, suspecting that not even unconsciousness would protect her.
Why was it demonic kidnappings never seemed to take place in rooms at the Radisson with
sweetly perfumed sheets and gourmet food?</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, kiddo,&quot; the demon's voice echoed off the walls
even though he'd moderated it slightly. &quot;No nightmares.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow rubbed her eyes, which were still burning. She briefly
focused on her hand, noting that it was perfectly clear. For the first time she noted that
it was only when she tried to look at the demon that her vision seemed to go totally
insane. &quot;Maybe from your point of view,&quot; she grumbled.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess I can see why you'd feel that way,&quot; her kidnapper
allowed. &quot;But it really is real enough.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look, my best friend is the Slayer, and she's not gonna like
it that you've kidnaped me, and...and... dragged me off to...well...wherever we are...so
maybe you should just--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That would be the cute blond last seen sleeping peacefully
after being introduced to a wall,&quot; the incubus cut in dryly, easily taking the wind
out of Willow's schoolground, my-best-friend-can-beat-you-up argument. &quot;You're gonna
have to do better than that...&quot; he paused for a long moment, then questioned,
&quot;What's your name anyway?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Willow,&quot; she snapped, already trying to marshal her still
shattered thought processes to figure a way out of her situation.</p>

<p>&quot;Pleased to meet you, Willow. I'm Melvinathoraxisthulixis. My
friends call me Melvin.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow started to toss off a grumpy retort, but fell silent as she
suddenly realized that the whole Keanu Reeves from hell 'tude wasn't assailing her ears
anymore. &quot;What's with your voice?&quot; she questioned abruptly, her brain not yet
functioning on enough thrusters for her to hold back her thoughts. &quot;I mean it's--well
not normal exactly--but not so annoyingly...well, stupid.&quot; She knew she probably
shouldn't have been quite so open, but just wasn't up to cunning at that moment.</p>

<p>The crimson blob shrugged. &quot;It keeps the fang-faces happy. They
all figure that incubi and succubi are nothing but sex-crazed weasels and sometimes it's
best to just play along. I mean, don't get me wrong, the sex is great, but it's not all
there is to us.&quot; His voice took on a resentful note. &quot;But try and tell that to a
vampire and all you'll get is snide jokes...this from a bunch of demons who can't even
work up enough charm to seduce their victims. Just biting and raw thuggery.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; Willow exhaled, her tone plainly expressing that she
had no idea what he was talking about. She considered his answer for a moment, then drew a
breath to ask--after the coughing spell was over-- &quot;So...um...why work with them? I
mean, if you don't like thuggery, you're not really not gonna be happy working with Spike.
He once helped save the world just so he could keep up his thuggery at its present level.
Personally, I think he just didn't want any competition.&quot; She rubbed her eyes again,
wishing they would clear, but her captor remained blobby and unfocused.</p>

<p>Willow covered her ears as Melvin laughed in response, then dusted
plaster dust off of her clothes as the sound rattled away. He certainly seemed to be a
cheerful sort. &quot;Now I believe that,&quot; Melvin said, a chuckle still rumbling
through his voice. &quot;Never met a vampire who had much in the way of refinement.&quot;</p>

<p>The hacker considered that comment for a brief moment. Melvin wasn't
exactly what she was used to dealing with in the way of vampiric enemies. For one thing,
so far he hadn't shown much interest in eating her. That alone gave her some hope.
&quot;Well, unrefined...that would pretty much define Spike and Drusilla. They're kind of
the if-you-don't-like-something-break-it types...or if you like it, break it...or if you
don't even really have an opinion about it, break it. They're big on
breaking...havoc...destruction...Spike tried to eat me once. We're not friends.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;His type don't have friends,&quot; Melvin dismissed with a
wave of an huge red hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Hard to argue that,&quot; Willow murmured, then fell silent
for a long moment, her expression thoughtful. &quot;I get the feeling,&quot; she began
hesitantly, &quot;that you're not exactly...um...on Spike's side....&quot; She had a sense
of a blobby red shrug and was assailed by a sigh that threatened to turn into a miniature
hurricane. At least her sense of smell must have been numbing down under the onslaught of
demonic B.O. because she was no longer possessed by the intense desire to strangle herself
to escape the odor.</p>

<p>&quot;We're not friends,&quot; he echoed her comment and added his
own wry twist to the words.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; Willow breathed and considered his answer for a long
moment. Finally, she spoke up hesitantly. &quot;Then maybe you could consider
just...well...letting me go? I mean, it would probably irritate Spike no end, and if you
don't like Spike--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, kiddo.&quot; Even at the level of a whisper, the
incubus' voice rumbled through the room, shaking the plaster off the walls. &quot;No can
do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not?&quot; Willow wheedled, sensing a possible chink in
her imprisonment. &quot;I'm small...not very tasty if you must know the truth...very
bony...hardly any meat...there are others you'd find much..more...delicious...&quot;</p>

<p>That brought another booming laugh that left Willow banging plaster
dust off her hair and jacket. &quot;I like you, kid.&quot; The demon's voice dropped low,
taking on a seductive note that startled his young prisoner. &quot;Except it doesn't work
that way. I have no desire to eat you, kid...at least not...that way.&quot; The creature
punctuated the words with a soft chuckle that made the hair on Willow's neck stand on end.</p>

<p>&quot;So what,&quot; Willow's voice threatened to crack, but she
managed to get it back under control to continue. &quot;What <i>do</i> you want to do
then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm an incubus,&quot; the creature told her, the low voice
oddly patient.</p>

<p>&quot;An incubus,&quot; Willow repeated, the word truly sinking in
for the first time. &quot;That's kind of like a succubus right...but male?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right,&quot; the creature confirmed.</p>

<p>Willow responded with a high pitched, nervous titter, before she
swallowed down her very natural urge to panic to exhale, &quot;So you...you're gonna...I
mean, you...and I...and...oh no.&quot; She rubbed her aching eyes again, wishing she could
bring him into focus. Then again, all things considered, maybe not. &quot;I really wish
you wouldn't,&quot; she whispered in a very small voice. Being with a demon <i>that way</i>
was really not high on her list of desired experiences.</p>

<p>&quot;You and me both, kid, but instinct is a funny thing and
neither one of will have a lot of choice when it comes down to it.&quot; Oddly enough, the
demon didn't sound terribly thrilled by the prospect.</p>

<p>&quot;But...if you don't want to...and I certainly <i>don't</i> want
to...&quot; the hacker trailed off. &quot;Why don't we both just leave?&quot; she
suggested hopefully. &quot;I'll tell you what, we can go get a cup of coffee...and part
friends. Why not give it a try?&quot;</p>

<p>The demon--<i>Melvin</i>, Willow mentally corrected herself--sank
down, or rather the blob that was all she could make out of him sank down, apparently
seating himself on something. &quot;Aside from the fact that we're locked in...well,
unfortunately blond and pointy toothed--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Spike,&quot; Willow inserted and Melvin nodded in
confirmation. At least that's what she thought he was doing. Or more correctly, that's
what she hoped he was doing.</p>

<p>&quot;Right...Spike...not that he bothered introducing himself to me
after the summoning. Just yanked me here and bound me to retrieving the staff without so
much as a by your leave.&quot; Melvin grunted a curse word in what Willow suspected was
supposed to be an under his breath sort of volume. It left her only mildly deafened.</p>

<p>&quot;Ummm...Spike summoned you?&quot; she prompted timidly when the
creature continued muttering in a language she didn't recognize for several seconds. There
was a brief pause and then he straightened a little and continued.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, <i>Spike</i> and that batty girlfriend of his--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Drusilla,&quot; Willow filled in.</p>

<p>The demon paused, the blob moving in a gesture that she was fairly
certain represented his head canting to one side as he studied her. &quot;So, are you on a
first name basis with <i>all</i> of the local demons?&quot;</p>

<p>Willow found herself unexpectedly blushing. &quot;Well,
no...but...well...with my best friend being the Slayer and all....&quot; She shrugged.
&quot;It's kind of a case of know thine enemy or be on their lunch menu.&quot;</p>

<p>Another wave of plaster dust accompanied the incubus' rumbling
laughter. &quot;And I'll bet they're all hungry for you, little girl,&quot; he said, his
voice dropping low in a way that sent unwanted chills down Willow's spine.</p>

<p>Willow couldn't decide quite how to take that, so she settled for
rubbing her tearing eyes again while a long moment of uncomfortable silence followed.</p>

<p>&quot;So...you play chess?&quot;</p>

<p>The question caught the hacker by surprise and she looked up,
blinking in confusion. &quot;Chess?&quot;</p>

<p>The blurry shape of the demon shrugged. &quot;Yeah. I haven't had a
good game in decades. It's not exactly a popular sport where I'm from...most demons are
more into the whole flaying, and drawing and quartering sort of thing.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow blanched, suddenly reminded of just what the creature before
her was, despite his civilized mien. Still, he wasn't exactly her enemy. He wasn't her
friend, but he might still be an ally. &quot;Umm, yeah...I play a couple of people on the
Internet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Internet,&quot; Melvin repeated. &quot;You know about that
then?&quot; At her nod, he continued. &quot;You'll have to tell me about it while we play.
I haven't spent much time on earth for the last century, and it's all new to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ummm, sure,&quot; the hacker murmured helplessly, while the
demon turned away and produced a hand carved chess set with pieces shaped like demons,
skeletons and walking corpses. She found if she concentrated on the wall just past his
shoulder or the chess set, her vision actually remained surprisingly clear.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry it's only a travel set,&quot; Melvin apologized as he
set out the pieces, each of which was the size of her hand. &quot;But the big one's kind
of a pain.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow's mouth O'ed in surprise, but she covered quickly.
&quot;That's fine,&quot; she assured him, swallowing a rise of nausea as she noted just
how detailed the pieces were. &quot;I...uh...a good game of chess sounds good.&quot;</p>

<p>And so the hacker and the demon passed the hours with chess and
tales of the Internet.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</p>

<p>&quot;There's no screaming,&quot; Drusilla pouted where she stood
next to the door the led down to the demon's prison in a sub-basement well below the
abandoned rooms where she was making her home with Spike. &quot;There was <i>supposed</i>
to be screaming.&quot;</p>

<p>Spike sighed softly, wondering, not for the first time, if the whole
summoning a demon thing was all it was cracked up to be. He eyed his girlfriend, noting
the mad look in her eyes. Or maybe he was just getting old. Once upon a time having a
certified lunatic for a girlfriend had seemed exciting, a little daring, even for a
vampire like himself. Unfortunately, it was starting to lose its appeal as he was forced
to follow her on one mad quest to destroy the world after another. He rather liked the
world, thank you very much. He had the sort of career others could only fantasize about,
plenty of food for the taking, and he could party anytime he liked so long as the sun was
down. He had no desire to sacrifice that to bring any number of demonic hosts back into
the world. As he was fast being reminded by the noxious odor that clung to everything in
their current abode, his fellow demons didn't always make for the best company. Being able
to walk in the sun again without being burned alive might be nice, but he was far from
certain it was worth the rest of the hassle that went with it. He was still lost in his
silent musings when Drusilla clawed his back, reminding him that she'd expected a
response.</p>

<p>&quot;There was supposed to be screaming,&quot; the vampiress
repeated, her expression twisted into a demonic pout.</p>

<p>Spike offered a weak, forced smile. &quot;Yes, I know, dear, and
there will be...when the festival takes place. If he takes her before that, it's all
rather pointless...remember?</p>

<p>&quot;Oh...yes,&quot; she exhaled before continuing, her perfect
ruby lips rounding in a feminine pout. &quot;Still wanted screaming...wanted to kill a
Slayer too...I never get to have any fun,&quot; she complained, then burst into crimson
tears.</p>


<p><i>Great, wonderful</i>, Spike thought to himself as he offered his
shoulder for her sudden sobs. He'd never get the stains out of his leather jacket if she
didn't get the bloodworks under control. He patted her hair absently, muttering a few,
&quot;There, there's,&quot; to soothe her tears. <i>God, the things one does for love.</p>
</i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Angel silently listened to Buffy's description of the situation,
instinctively sensing that there were things she wasn't telling him. He considered
pressing for more answers, only to decide against it when he saw the look in her eyes. She
was truly broken up and pressuring her now wouldn't help anything. They all had more than
enough stress to deal with, what with graduation coming up all to quickly, but the Slayer
had borne the lion's share of the load. Now to have her best friend and confidante in
danger once again was obviously ripping her up emotionally. His eyes narrowed as he
glanced out the broad double doors that led into his home, a closed up mansion on the edge
of Sunnydale, noting the faint hint of amber that was just barely beginning to touch the
sky. &quot;There's nothing I can do tonight,&quot; he said softly. &quot;But as soon as
it's dark again...&quot; he let the sentence trail off as Buffy nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;Any ideas for places I can check during daylight?&quot; she
asked crisply, visibly struggling not to let her own fears show.</p>

<p>Angel considered the question for a long moment, while Buffy bounced
on her heels, anxious to be moving, doing something. They'd already wasted too much time.
God only knew what Spike, Drusilla, and their buddy, the neighborhood incubus might be
doing to Willow.</p>

<p>&quot;There are a couple of empty buildings in the industrial
district. I'd try those first. They'll need someplace that has a lot of room for the
incubus. They're not going to want to be too close to him if they can help it.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy nodded. &quot;Yeah...the smell...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Vampires are no fonder of it than humans,&quot; Angel
confirmed. &quot;Buffy,&quot; he began again after a beat, his hooded gaze tracking her as
she paced to let off steam. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; The question was obvious on the
surface, but it held a wealth of different meanings all tied up in the simple words.</p>

<p>&quot;Fine, great, wonderful,&quot; the Slayer snapped impatiently.
&quot;Some freaking demon has my best...&quot; Buffy verbally stumbled, then caught
herself. &quot;...my best friend...and I let it happen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alone...against Spike, Drusilla, and an incubus,&quot; Angel
reminded her gently. &quot;You're lucky you weren't killed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I can just feel the luck pulsing through me this
week,&quot; the Slayer snarled, then turned to leave, her step dragging. &quot;Look, if
you don't have any other suggestions, I should be going,&quot; she threw back over her
shoulder.</p>

<p>Angel stood watching her with a slight frown as though he was seeing
something he'd never seen before. &quot;You might also check that abandoned warehouse we
cleaned out last week. It might do for what they want.&quot;</p>

<p>When it appeared he had no other suggestions, Buffy gestured toward
the door. &quot;I should be going now,&quot; she said again.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; Angel's voice caught her before she could leave
and she turned back. &quot;You're under a lot of stress right now. Don't get
careless.&quot;</p>

<p>She nodded sharply. &quot;Don't worry, I won't. Willow's counting on
me,&quot; she added, then hurried out the door.</p>

<p>Her former lover stood lost in thought for several long minutes, his
brow creased, his eyes giving away nothing of his thoughts. After a long moment, he turned
toward the back room where a stack of city plans lay waiting. Obtained by Willow in order
to help in their campaign against the mayor, they might well offer some clue to saving the
young woman. He had things to do, vampires to track, the only help he could offer during
the lonely daylight hours.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Nothing. Buffy Summers resisted the urge to scream as she explored
the darkest, most hidden reaches of Sunnydale. In ten short hours, she'd killed out two
nests of sleeping vampires, but found nothing of her missing friend. And the clock was
ticking down. She glanced at her watch. Only a couple more hours until nightfall. God, if
anything happened to Willow--no, she couldn't go there. It was too horrible to
contemplate. She had to pray and keep hunting. As she passed a payphone, she took a moment
to call in, her voice clipped as she explained the situation to Giles, offering little
insight into her worried thoughts.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy.&quot; Her Watcher sounded as bad as she felt. &quot;You
shouldn't be doing this alone.&quot;</p>

<p>She laughed softly in response, wondering if the irony would occur
to Giles. In the beginning his lectures had been quite the opposite. &quot;Don't worry,
I'm being careful. Have you found out anything?&quot;</p>

<p>The long, silent pause was all the answer she needed. &quot;I'm
going to check a couple more places, then stop by Angel's and see if he has any more
ideas. I'll let you know when you can help.&quot;</p>

<p>He was still saying her name, preparatory to a gentle lecture, when
she hung up.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Willow was surprised to find that the demon, or Melvin as she had
come to think of him was actually decent company. He was a fair chess player and curious
about her and her hobbies. They had discussed everything from the wilds of the internet to
Buffy and the art of vampire slaying. Oddly, though he was technically a fellow demon, the
incubus seemed to feel that offing vampires wasn't such a bad thing. In fact, if it
weren't for the vision problems and the knowledge that he apparently intended to have his
way with her and turn her into a succubus, she might have been having fun. She reached up,
massaging the back of her neck. Well, maybe fun was overstating it. She was getting a
vicious headache, probably from the way her vision went haywire every time she chanced to
look at her demonic suitor. She was also borderline to passing out from sheer exhaustion;
of course twenty-four hours without a wink of sleep will do that to a body. The smell
probably wasn't helping any either, though her nose had long since gone dead from the
overstimulation. She leaned her head on her hand as she waited for Melvinathoraxisthulixis
to make his move. Make his move, now there was an ironic turn of phrase. Willow let out a
hollow, desperate laugh as it struck her that she was playing chess all of the way to her
doom. A blobby red hand froze over the chess pieces just within range of her downturned
eyes, then slowly drew back.</p>

<p>&quot;You okay, kid?&quot; the demon's voice echoed off the walls,
but the tone was gentle, worried, and oddly soothing, none of which she really wanted. She
wondered if it would have been easier if she could hate him. She had tried a trick or two
over the course of the day, but as far as she could tell the demon hadn't even noticed her
efforts to use magic against him. Pencils and the like might be effective against a
vampire, but when it came to the scaly hide of the incubus, anything that small was less
than useless. Meanwhile, she could feel her body responding to his strange gentleness in
ways she couldn't even begin to understand.</p>

<p>Which meant that she was more or less screwed, literally and
figuratively. Willow waved a limp hand. &quot;I don't want this,&quot; she breathed.</p>

<p>Melvin was instantly contrite. &quot;Hey, we don't have to play
chess. I think I have a backgammon game somewhere--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't mean the chess,&quot; Willow cut him off in a ragged
voice as she snapped to her feet to glare at him full force for the first time in hours.
&quot;I mean...this.&quot; She gestured at their dingy surroundings. &quot;You ... me ...
this ....&quot; She sat down heavily, suddenly aware of the way her heart was hammering in
her chest, literally pounding against her ribcage with the effort required to keep pumping
blood through her body. &quot;I don't want it.&quot; She squinted, wondering if she was
imagining the way his features seemed to swim into partial focus for a brief moment. God,
he really was ugly, but his expression was sympathetic enough that she barely controlled
the impulse to fall into his arms and sob her heart out.</p>

<p>His soft sigh rattled the single lightbulb hanging overhead. &quot;I
know,&quot; he admitted sadly. Whatever he was using as a chair creaked and rattled as he
rose and turned away from her. &quot;And believe it or not, kid, if it was my choice,
nothing would happen--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then don't do it,&quot; Willow pleaded. &quot;Don't do what
Spike wants...just don't...&quot;</p>

<p>He turned back. &quot;It doesn't work that way...for one thing, if I
don't, you'll die....&quot;</p>

<p>Willow choked on a gasp, fighting back the terror. &quot;No--&quot;
And yet she could feel the weakness in her body, the sense that nothing was quite the way
it had been only a few hours before.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. It's already starting...your body's changing--&quot;</p>

<p>Willow shook her head, not wanting to believe, even though she knew
it was true. &quot;No...you're lying.&quot;</p>

<p>He shook his head, putting an end to her hopes with gentle
insistence. &quot;And for another thing, once it's time, I won't be able to stop...call it
survival of the species...instinct...whatever...&quot;</p>

<p>In the hours since her kidnapping, it had all seemed painfully
unreal. At first she'd expected rescue to come at any moment, and then as she wiled away
the hours with her oddly courtly kidnapper, she'd become convinced at some level that it
simply wouldn't happen. &quot;Why?!&quot; she demanded on an angry sob.</p>

<p>The beast retook his seat. &quot;Because all creatures have a drive
to reproduce...because once the ceremony starts, neither of us will be in control.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Reproduce?&quot; Willow questioned, massaging her temple as it
struck her how hot she was feeling.</p>

<p>&quot;Humans have an urge to reproduce their genetic code, to unite
egg and sperm, vampires sire new vampires, and incubi produce succubi, while succubi
produce incubi. Every species has an inborn need to continue itself.&quot;</p>

<p>The hacker folded her arms around herself, feeling very small and
helpless in the face of everything. &quot;But I'm not a species...I'm Willow.&quot;</p>

<p>A long moment of silence followed and then a booming sigh. &quot;I
can't help you, Willow...even if I'd like to,&quot; Melvin apologized a little sadly.
&quot;But I can tell you this much, there's a way out of it. There's always a way out. You
just have to find it....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then tell me how,&quot; Willow begged as she closed her eyes,
conscious of the pain throbbing through her body. There was something different, achingly
so, and her body was responding in unfamiliar ways to the sound of his voice, the sense of
his body near. &quot;No,&quot; she choked, trying to force the changes back through sheer
force of will.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; Melvinathoraxisthulixis chided gently. &quot;You
can't fight it that way.&quot; He was silent for a long moment, leaving her to wonder if
it was time already, but he simply waited until she had regained some small measure of her
composure and asked, &quot;You got a boyfriend?&quot;</p>

<p>Willow blinked, failing to understand why that was of any
importance. &quot;Oz.&quot; she exhaled heavily. &quot;His name's Oz?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He love you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know...I guess...look, I don't understand what--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you love him?&quot; Melvin cut her off, his voice firmer
than it had been before, brooking no refusal to answer on her part.</p>

<p>The hacker shrugged. &quot;Yes, no, maybe, I don't know.&quot; Once
upon a time she would have answered that question much more decisively, but after the way
she'd been thinking about Buffy lately, and particularly after the way her friend's
revelations outside the <i>Witches' Brew</i> had made her feel, she was far less certain
now. She waved a hand loosely in a gesture meant to dismiss the subject. &quot;It's
complicated.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So there's someone else?&quot; The words were half statement,
half question, pushing her to think about things she was in no hurry to think about.</p>

<p>Willow massaged her temple tiredly, trying to focus past the pain in
her chest that seemed to be radiating throughout her body now. &quot;Kind of...it's hard
to explain...&quot; She tucked a stray lock of crimson hair behind her ear. &quot;I just
don't know,&quot; she exhaled in a very small voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, you do,&quot; the demon's voice echoed the one inside her
own head.</p>

<p>She shook her head weakly. &quot;No...it's not that easy....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;True love never is...but it's the only thing that can save
you, Willow. It's like all those old fairy tales. Only true love can save the lady
fair.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow buried her face in her hands, her situation and the weakness
throbbing in her limbs momentarily leaving her feeling completely hopeless. &quot;I'm no
lady fair,&quot; she sighed. If true love's kiss was all that could save her, and she was
in love with Buffy, but Buffy was still in love with Angel--and Willow was under no
illusions, her friend might have feelings for her, they might even be a little romantic,
but she was undoubtedly still hopelessly in love with Angel--her true love--then she,
Willow, was extraordinarily screwed. She started a brief moment later when huge fingers
touched her hair with amazing gentleness. She was once again aware of how hard her heart
was pounding in her chest as she twisted to look at Melvin, gasping in the struggle to
draw air into her lungs. Crimson features swam into view--seeming less fractured and
uneven than she expected--and she thought she caught a glimpse of a surprisingly sweet
smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Not true,&quot; he disagreed. &quot;Believe me, I know fair
ladies--it's my profession, you might say--and you're one of the fairest of them
all....&quot;</p>

<p>Willow stared at him in confusion, struggling to connect the dots
and understand what he was trying to tell her. The world spun around her, tipping
violently on its axis and nearly sending her to the floor. Strong hands caught her, and
she felt an unaccustomed shiver of awareness as she was lifted and carried back to the
mattress in the corner.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, sleep for awhile.&quot; A gentle hand smoothed her hair.
&quot;You'll need your strength later...whatever happens....&quot;</p>
