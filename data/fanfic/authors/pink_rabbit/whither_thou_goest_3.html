<!-- Whither Thou Goest \ Chapter Two -->

<P>Joyce Summers resisted the urge to curse as she took another swallow of
lukewarm coffee. For perhaps the thousandth time, she glanced at her watch,
noting the slowly advancing hour with a disgusted sigh. It looked like she
wasn't going to get any sleep. Not that the client she was scheduled to meet
wasn't worth the effort--after all, she was contracted to get ten percent of the
auction of the extensive collection of impressionist paintings and sketches the
woman was selling--but she was already nearly two hours late and Joyce had had a
long day. There was also the niggling worry that it was Sunnydale and going
missing in this particular small town was seldom a positive experience. She knew
more about that particular facet of her adopted home than she might have
preferred since her daughter was the Slayer--the Chosen One--tasked to protect
the world from the evils of the night--which included the Hellmouth, an entry
from the Netherworld that just happened to reside in Sunnydale, and attracted
every sort of evil known to man. She was proud of Buffy for the responsibility
she'd taken on, respected her child, knew that she was often all that stood
between life and eternal damnation.</P>
<P>But, if and when she was honest with herself, she had to admit it scared the
living hell out of her. Mostly, she dealt with the fear through sheer,
unadulterated denial, but it gnawed at her and left her terrified that she was
somehow failing her child due to her own inability to deal with the ugly
realities of life she'd discovered the night Buffy ran away from home. Her
daughter had come back and they'd made some kind of peace, but it all still
frightened her, driving her to push herself until she couldn't think anymore. If
she couldn't think, she couldn't worry and wonder what was happening to Buffy,
couldn't imagine the funeral she would probably have to attend one day. She
didn't know much about Slayers, but she'd learned enough to know there was no
retirement plan. Her daughter would die one day, and the chances were very high
she would all too young when it happened.</P>
<P>Joyce shuddered as though someone had walked over her grave and took another
sip of her coffee, silently willing her client to appear. Anything to block the
morbid path her thoughts were taking.</P>
<P>As if in answer to the unspoken summons, a soft knock rattled the art gallery
front door. Joyce's head snapped up, a relieved expression on her face as she
called out, &quot;Yes,&quot; and hurried toward the door.</P>
<P>&quot;Mrs. Summers,&quot; a warm, softly accented voice called through the
door. &quot;My apologies for running late.&quot;</P>
<P>Joyce swung the door open, revealing a very pretty young woman with short
blond hair, and what looked to be an almost delicate build under her heavy black
trenchcoat. She didn't appear to be much older than Buffy. Surprised, she took a
half step back. &quot;Devon Carstairs?&quot; She had expected her customer to be
considerably older.</P>
<P>The young woman smiled and shook her head. &quot;I'm afraid not,&quot; she
said hastily. &quot;I'm Blaine Michaels, Ms. Carstairs personal
assistant....&quot; She shrugged, still looking embarrassed. &quot;Also her
niece if you must know the truth. Dev had to leave for France rather
unexpectedly...there was a fire at an estate she owns near Luxembourg. She sent
me down here in her place...and unfortunately, I managed to have both a flat on
the Ten and a dead cell phone battery.&quot; Visibly flustered, the young woman
ran a hand through her hair. &quot;I apologize for keeping you waiting. Truly, I
had no idea I'd run this late or I would have called you before leaving Los
Angeles to let you know about the change.&quot; She stuffed her hands in the
pockets of the calf length black trenchcoat that flared around her slender legs.
Again she flashed an embarrassed smile, making Joyce feel churlish for any
annoyance she'd been feeling at the lateness of the hour. &quot;God, I swear, if
I weren't family, Aunt Dev would just fire me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't worry about it. I had to work late anyway,&quot; Joyce inserted,
and held the door wide as she waved the young woman in. &quot;Come on in. Your
aunt faxed me the crate number that was miss-shipped, and it's right back
here,&quot; she continued as she led the courier through the gallery toward the
storage area in the back.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm sure she'll be very pleased with how organized you are.&quot;</P>
<P>Joyce laughed softly. &quot;Well, it's quite a collection to get ready for
sale. She has some wonderful impressionist works.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; Blaine Michaels agreed smoothly. &quot;She inherited much of
it from my grandmother. She was the serious art collector...and, in truth, some
of the more valuable pieces in the collection came from her father...he was in
Europe before the war and picked several things up for a song.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm just amazed she's selling. I'd think it would be awfully hard to
part with some of them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, well, I'm afraid my aunt has suffered some financial setbacks this
year. The market has not been kind and she needs the cash.&quot;</P>
<P>Joyce flinched sympathetically. &quot;So sorry to hear that.&quot;</P>
<P>The girl shrugged philosophically. &quot;It happens.&quot;</P>
<P>As they entered the tightly packed confines of the back room, Joyce wove
between several rolling work tables as she gestured toward the front crate in a
stack of flat, painting crates stacked against one wall. &quot;It's the top
one,&quot; she informed her guest.</P>
<P>The young woman stepped fluidly past Joyce, her posture stiff as she pulled
up short in front of the crate. &quot;No,&quot; she said almost instantly.
&quot;This isn't the right one. It's too small.&quot; She reached out, brushing
dust off the packing slip taped to the outside of the wooden crate. &quot;Here's
the problem. There's a scuff mark. If you don't look closely, it looks like it
says Oh-four, but it's Oh-seven.&quot; She straightened and Joyce heard a soft
curse as she leaned past her to look at the error.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm so sorry,&quot; the tall blond apologized. &quot;How much
larger?&quot;</P>
<P>The young woman gestured with her hands, indicating a package roughly three
feet by four feet.</P>
<P>Joyce resisted the urge to curse. &quot;It must be one of the ones at my
house.&quot; She flushed at the annoyed look turned her way. &quot;The
collection is so large, and I needed more work-space here,&quot; she said
defensively. &quot;I stored some pieces at my house. If you like, I can go back,
get them, and bring them here for you. It shouldn't take me more than an
hour...two at the most.&quot;</P>
<P>The young woman glanced at her watch where it resided on her inner wrist.
&quot;Unfortunately, I have to be back in LA at eight am and I'm cutting it
close as it is.&quot; She uttered another curse under her breath.</P>
<P>&quot;I can have it shipped to any address you'd like--&quot; Joyce offered,
but Blaine cut her off quickly.</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; she said very quickly, then offered a tight smile. &quot;Aunt
Devon asked me to see to it personally. It's something of a family heirloom.
I'll just have to drive back tomorrow night. Is ten o'clock tomorrow evening all
right with you? I'm sorry it's so late, but I've got meetings all day tomorrow,
and I won't be able to get back to Sunnydale before then.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of course,&quot; Joyce agreed quickly.</P>
<P>The young woman smiled. &quot;Thank you, hopefully this time things will go a
little more smoothly and I won't be quite so late.&quot;</P>
<P>Joyce forced down an unexplained shiver as she nodded in agreement, shaking
hands politely and wishing her young customer well. She missed the brief glimpse
of thick blood congealed and drying on the young woman's dark shirt front as she
stepped out into the night and a fresh wind caught the edges of her coat,
briefly blowing them apart before slender hands pulled them back together.
Certainly it never occurred to her that she was doing a business deal with the
dead.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</P>
<P>&quot;Just another fun night in Sunnyhell,&quot; Buffy exhaled where she sat
on the front porch of the Twenty-Four/Seven, her legs stretched out in front of
her. To the east, the horizon was turning the soft shade of pink that heralded
morning. She looked up as she heard soft footsteps, smiling limply at Willow as
the hacker sank down next to her and leaned her head against the Slayer's
shoulder. &quot;You okay?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They had a lot of questions. I feel kind of stupid because I couldn't
really answer them. It all happened so fast that I'm not quite sure what
happened.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Buffy sighed tiredly. She would have sworn she'd known what
transpired in those final moments, but when she'd tried to describe it to the
detective, somehow she couldn't quite lay things out in a way that made sense in
her own head.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm not sure they believed me,&quot; Willow added, then buried her face
in Buffy's shoulder as though she could block the ugly events of the night out
of her mind.</P>
<P>&quot;Not surprising,&quot; the Slayer exhaled. &quot;They've obviously
looked up my files. That whole mess with Kendra came up...&quot; She leaned her
cheek against the top of Willow's head. &quot;God, some days I think I'm
cursed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You live in Sunnydale. I think it's one of the requirements,&quot; was
Willow's muffled response.</P>
<P>&quot;Point taken,&quot; Buffy sighed, so exhausted that she didn't have the
wherewithal to resist the urge to nuzzle Willow's hair affectionately, taking
comfort from the feel and smell of the silky strands.</P>
<P>They were still sitting there like that long minutes later, when Rupert
Giles' aging Citroen pulled up. The Englishman climbed out, his hair and clothes
askew, his expression rife with worry. &quot;Buffy...Willow...&quot; He searched
for any signs of injury as he hurried forward.</P>
<P>&quot;We're okay,&quot; Buffy assured him while Willow looked up and offered
a wan smile.</P>
<P>Giles ran a shaky hand through his hair as he looked inside the small store,
noting the police still working amid upended shelves and shattered glass.
&quot;What happened?&quot; He looked at the Slayer again.
&quot;Who...when...&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You forgot why and where?&quot; Buffy said acidly as she pushed to her
feet, then reached back to tug Willow up. &quot;But the answer is, three guys in
ski masks with shotguns, about three hours ago--&quot;</P>
<P>Giles appeared horrified. &quot;You should have called me sooner.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not an option,&quot; Willow sighed tiredly.</P>
<P>&quot;Mm,&quot; Buffy mumbled in confirmation. &quot;The police had a lot of
questions, and since Willow and I were the only ones not unconscious or
dead...&quot; she trailed off suggestively.</P>
<P>&quot;Dead?&quot; Giles exhaled, losing another shade of color at the
thought.</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah,&quot; the Slayer sighed and nodded toward the front door of the
store. &quot;Another customer. She never had a chance.&quot; She dragged a hand
through her hair, her tone disgusted as she muttered. &quot;So much for my
vaunted Slayer powers. I couldn't even stop three stupid thugs--&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They had shotguns, Buffy,&quot; Willow reminded her. &quot;Nobody could
have done any better.&quot;</P>
<P>Giles settled a hand on the blond's narrow shoulder. &quot;I'm sure Willow's
right,&quot; he tried to reassure her. &quot;You may be the Slayer, but you're
not invulnerable. A shotgun blast will kill you just like anyone else.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy's mouth twisted in an grim smile. &quot;Yeah, tell that to the dead
woman's family. I'm sure it will be a lot of comfort.&quot; Then the Slayer
broke away and climbed into Giles' car without further comment.</P>
<P>Willow turned a sad-eyed look Giles' way. &quot;You know how she gets
when...well...when she loses one.&quot;</P>
<P>A muscle flexed in the Watcher's jaw. &quot;Yes.&quot; He looked at Willow
seriously as though trying to assess her condition. She'd been through so much
recently that he was worried about her. &quot;Are <I>you</I> all right?&quot;</P>
<P>There was a certain lack of sincerity to Willow's tone when she answered.
&quot;I'm fine. Just tired...it was pretty bad.&quot; Her shoulders tipped in a
prosaic shrug. &quot;But then again, we've both seen things that were a lot
worse.&quot;</P>
<P>Frowning, Giles demanded, &quot;What were you two doing here at this
hour?&quot; as though somehow their schedule was at fault.</P>
<P>The hacker shook her head. &quot;Just being silly,&quot; she brushed the
question off. She wrapped her arms tightly around herself, shivering in the
predawn chill. &quot;Look, Giles, I really think we should get back to the
dorms. It's been a long night.&quot; She wavered on her feet, so tired she could
barely remain upright.</P>
<P>The two stared at each other for a long moment, Giles suspecting there was
something else he should say, but at a total loss as to what. Finally, he just
nodded. &quot;Get in the car. I'll take you back.&quot;</P>
<P>It was only a little over a half a mile back to the dorms and the drive took
place in total silence, the three occupants of the tiny car all lost in their
respective thoughts. Willow had wiped most of the blood from her hands on a
towel the officer who interviewed her had handed her, but it was still caked on
her clothes and smell of it filled the crowded space despite the open windows,
reminding each of them of the night's high price.</P>
<P>Giles pulled into the small parking lot at the rear of the dorm, and parked
near the back doors, then turned to peer at the Slayer where she lay sprawled in
the back seat. After a brief glance at Willow, who appeared equally worn out, he
cleared his throat. &quot;Look, you two both look like hell. I'm not sure a
dormitory is quite the right place for you right now. Why don't you come stay at
my place for a day or two. Get some rest...deal with...what's happened...&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy let out a grim bark of laughter. &quot;I don't know. Will, you think
Dr. Walsh would let us have the day off for stumbling into the middle of a
murder?&quot;</P>
<P>A swell of hysterical giggles bubbled up from the hacker's chest. &quot;Only
if we were the victims.&quot;</P>
<P>That appeared to strike Buffy as hilariously funny much to Giles' chagrin,
though he quickly realized it wasn't real laughter, but rather a way of venting
the monstrous stress of the evening. &quot;Buffy...Willow...&quot; he said in a
carefully controlled voice. &quot;It's obvious that you're--&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Too tired for this conversation,&quot; Buffy cut him off impatiently as
she climbed out of the small car, then reached back to catch Willow's hand and
tug her out as well. She ran a trembling hand through her hair. &quot;Look,
Giles it's not that I don't appreciate the offer, but I really want to sleep in
my own bed tonight...&quot; Then, noting that it was rapidly becoming daylight,
she snorted something impolite under her breath. &quot;Or not sleep as the case
may be.&quot; She sighed heavily. &quot;Besides, hanging with Spike and watching
Passions together is not my idea of a therapy day.&quot;</P>
<P>Giles glanced at the sleepy redhead standing next to the Slayer.
&quot;Willow?&quot;</P>
<P>The girl shook her head. &quot;I don't think so,&quot; she demurred without
further explanation.</P>
<P>The Watcher sighed heavily, quashing the urge to order them back into the car
with effort. He could see the exhaustion and hurt in every facet of both girls
and wanted nothing more than to protect them and help them through it.
Unfortunately, by the look of it, they were no more receptive to the help he
wanted to offer than he would have been at that age. &quot;Be careful,&quot; he
said at last. &quot;And remember, you can always call me...&quot; He turned a
piercing gaze on the Slayer. &quot;I know I'm not officially your Watcher
anymore, but I hope I'll always be your friend.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of course you are,&quot; Willow filled in instantly, though the Slayer
was silent for a long moment. Suddenly, she blinked back to the real world and
nodded, confirming Willow's words.</P>
<P>&quot;Of course we're friends, Giles,&quot; she assured him.</P>
<P>And if there was a note of reserve in her words, well, it was understandable
after the night's events. Shock and all that. At least, that was what Rupert
Giles told himself as he got back in his car and drove away.</P>
