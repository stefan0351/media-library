<!-- Whither Thou Goest \ Chapter Three -->

<P>&quot;Do you want to talk?&quot; Willow questioned, her voice sounding
curiously hollow even to her own ears.</P>
<P>Buffy looked at her sideways. &quot;Not really...you?&quot; The question was
dryly asked, making it clear that the Slayer was in no mood to discuss anything.
She turned away and began digging through her closet, yanking out clothes.</P>
<P>Willow stared at her friend's stiff back, uncertain what to say or do. The
comforting closeness that had existed between them in the aftermath of the
attack had evaporated somewhere during the drive to the dorm, and the hacker was
far from certain why. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Fine,&quot; Buffy clipped without elaborating as she continued putting
her things together.</P>
<P>Her arms wrapped tightly around herself, Willow blinked back the tears
threatening to fill her eyes. &quot;Yeah, I can see that,&quot; she said so
softly Buffy almost didn't hear the words.</P>
<P>Buffy froze, stiffening. A beat passed, and then she slowly turned enough to
look back over her shoulder at her friend, wincing as she saw the blood that
still stained Willow's clothes, a hauntingly tangible reminder that she wasn't
the only one who'd had a bad night. A muscle pulsed in the Slayer's jaw and she
started to say something only to fall silent at the last moment. Finally, she
just muttered, &quot;I need a shower before I get to class,&quot; and hurried
out. <I>Coward,</I> that annoying inner voice whispered in her ear, daring her
to turn back, but for once, the Slayer wasn't up to being brave. She just needed
to run away.</P>
<P>Willow stared at the closed door that lay between them for a long time before
she finally staggered forward and grabbed her own clothes. Buffy wasn't the only
one in dire need of a shower and the thought of being alone left her slightly
nauseous.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</P>
<P>The day that followed was the sort that crawls--<I>slowly</I>--by. Willow sat
dazedly in her classes, barely conscious of what her teachers were saying and
perversely grateful that she only had one class with Buffy on Fridays, the
eminently ditchable Freshman Composition--her grade was so high in there that
she'd have to miss it for a month before she even dropped to a B--and after the
little scene in their dorm room, she just wasn't in the mood to see her best
friend.</P>
<P>When her four o'clock class, Principles of Concurrent Programming--a
whiz-bang paradigms course from the computer department that even she found more
than a little challenging--swung around, she was so tired of it all that she
almost scrapped it and took Giles up on his offer to use his guestroom. If it
weren't for the fact that Buffy's Watcher would have wanted to know what was
going on--and Willow honestly didn't have an answer for that--she would have. So
instead, she went to class, sat in the back--a lonely position to say the least
since the ambitious crowd that made up the student-body tended to take the front
rows--and spent the entire ninety minutes doodling in her notebook and
completely ignoring the professor's lecture. Particularly somewhere during the
last fifteen minutes when she started crying and couldn't seem to stop: big fat,
soundless tears that fell from her cheeks and made her doodles blot when they
hit her notebook. Lost in her own private misery, she didn't notice class had
ended until she realized other students were filing out the door, most of them
merrily plotting a wild weekend of programming and hacking. The joys of Fridays
in the farthest reaches of geekdom. If she hadn't already felt so depressed, it
would have taken Willow down another notch. As it was, she just ducked her head,
letting her bangs fall across her forehead, and hoped no one noticed the tears
as she pretended to be finishing up her notes. Finally, when everyone had gone,
she stuffed her things together and hurried out. To hell with it all. She was so
tired she could barely stay on her feet and if Buffy wanted to fight, she was
comfortably certain she could just sleep through it.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</P>
<P>Willow was already asleep--or at least she was in bed and feigning
sleep--when Buffy got in. It was barely dark out, making her feel guilty for not
being outside fighting the evils she knew ranged through the night--Giles and
Xander had both more or less ordered her to take the night off, promising to
take her place. Her hands fisted at her sides. She would have preferred to just
see to her patrol. It was her duty. Besides, the notion of killing something was
almost uncomfortably appealing. She'd been hoping to blow off some of the angry
stress that had settled in the pit of her stomach and between her shoulderblades.
Unfortunately, both of her friends had been insistent and even Anya had
helpfully commented on how awful she looked. After that, the walk back to campus
had seemed longer than she remembered. Unfettered by the strain of concentrating
on the fight at hand, the Slayer's brain had busied itself by pursuing any
number of mental paths she would have preferred to avoid.</P>
<P>Like the way she'd treated Willow in the dorm room after Giles dropped them
off. She'd blown that one completely and she wasn't even quite sure why. Maybe
it was just the guilt and the reminder that, as the Slayer, she was supposed to
protect people, but from the moment she'd seen Giles she'd been even more on
edge. But, whatever the reasons, the fact remained that she had failed and hurt
Willow. One. More. Time.</P>
<P>Buffy ran a hand through her hair, mentally castigating herself as she stared
at her friend's figure where she lay coiled into her blankets. She was fairly
certain that she wasn't sleeping, there was just too much tension in her
position and her breathing seemed too controlled, but she wasn't quite certain
enough to risk waking her. <I>Or maybe you're just afraid that you've finally
well and truly blown it for good</I>, her personal Jiminy Cricket whispered in
her ear. <I>And if that's the case, you've really screwed up your life but good
this time</I>.</P>
<P>Buffy sighed softly, amazed that she could be so brave when faced with death
and so damn cowardly when faced with her own emotions. Finally, she just turned
away and readied for bed in silence before finally falling onto her mattress in
a heap. Despite the profusion of thoughts running unchecked through her head,
she was so tired that she was asleep in moments. She never heard the soft
movements less than an hour later as Willow slipped from her bed to turn on her
computer. She'd slept for awhile on returning to the dorm, but Buffy's return
had wakened her, and she just couldn't seem to fall back asleep, so she decided
to get some work done, hoping it would distract her from her own thoughts and
fears.</P>
<P ALIGN="center">* * * * * *</P>
<P ALIGN="left">Joyce Summers grunted softly as she hefted a heavy crate
containing her customer's missing painting from the hand truck she'd used to
transport it in from her trunk, up onto a work table in the back room of the
gallery. Several nails and one plank had come loose during the transport and
they needed to be hammered back together. She cursed softly as another plank
came loose while she was lifting the crate. The delivery staff had been rough
with everything, but by the looks of it, this piece had suffered the worst of
the group. Once it was stable, she grabbed a hammer and moved to tap the nails
back into place only to set it aside as she noted the packing material leaking
from the gap between planks. Poking at it to try and push the shredded paper
back inside the bounds of the crate, she succeeded only in pulling more of it
out through the gap. After another round of curses, she used the claw on the
hammer to pull up several nails, hoping that if she released another plank, she
could repack the whole thing properly and then seal it up.</P>
<P>And froze. Joyce leaned closer, staring at what she could see of the painting
through the gap in the wood and packing. The painting was obviously wrapped in
thick felt padding to protect it, but the felt had ridden up, revealing an
ornate gilded frame and the bottom right corner of the canvas. Joyce frowned,
head tipping to one side as she saw the last part of the signature. She leaned
closer, frowning to make out the little snippet of the name. &quot;It can't
be,&quot; she whispered to herself, not believing what she was thinking. She
brushed more of the packing material aside and carefully pushed the felt out of
the way until the signature was completely revealed. &quot;It can't be,&quot;
the woman whispered, then glanced at her watch. It was only a little past six.
Four hours until her client was due to arrive. Which left her with more than
enough time to open the crate and then repackage it. She paused for a long
moment, debating whether or not she should do it. She leaned closer to peer at
the flowing script for a long moment, then picked up her hammer and began
removing nails.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</P>
<P>Buffy Summers was dreaming and half aware of the dream state even as she
watched the events unfold. <I>She was at the Bronze, wearing something soft and
slinky that left her arms and shoulders bare and swirled around her thighs in
soft waves. Riley was there, dancing with her, his eyes glittering with the
familiar lights of lust that she'd learned to expect from most men, while his
friends were all around them, only they weren't dressed like they normally did.
Instead, they were wearing camouflage fatigues and some kind of combat vests.
She tried to pull away, and see better, but he kept tugging her back, his voice
smooth as he urged her to ignore them.</P>
<P>&quot;That's not important,&quot; Riley insisted, still moving to the music.
&quot;Only <B>this</B> is important.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Buffy!&quot;</P>
<P>The Slayer twisted and caught a glimpse of red hair, before her line of sight
was blocked by camouflaged men. &quot;That's Willow,&quot; she exhaled and
started to pull away only to have Riley yank her back.</P>
<P>He smiled down at her, hips swaying with the rhythm. &quot;Don't worry about
her,&quot; he insisted.. He leaned down and nibbled on Buffy's bare shoulder.
&quot;She's not like us.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy tried to subtly pull away, but his grip was too strong as he pressed
against her. She heard a pained cry and looked back in time to see Willow try to
break through the camouflaged wall of flesh, only to be grabbed and yanked back.</P>
<P>&quot;Ignore her,&quot; Riley muttered, trying to drag her back into the
dance. &quot;She's just a distraction from what's <B>really</B> important...<B>us</B>...you
belong with a real <B>man</B>...&quot; His hands slid over her shoulders and she
couldn't pull away even though she wanted to. It was like something held her
there and wouldn't let go. She braced her palms on his chest, trying to push,
but somehow unable to make her body obey the dictates of her mind, she found her
fingers digging into his vest--&quot;vest?&quot; her dream mind questioned--and
dragging him closer.</P>
<P>Willow cried out again, her voice thick with pain this time. &quot;Buffy!&quot;
She grunted, and the Slayer heard the sound of flesh striking flesh as Willow
cried out, &quot;Let me go!&quot;</P>
<P>And then the Slayer did find the strength to twist away, stumbling back from
Riley to turn toward her friend. Willow was being held between two of Riley's
camo-pals and they laughed cheerfully as she struck at them and tried to break
free. Parker was standing behind the girl, and he threw a leering wink Buffy's
way as he slid an arm around her friend.</P>
<P>&quot;Buffy, please,&quot; Willow whimpered, still struggling with her
captors. &quot;I need you!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No she doesn't,&quot; Riley whispered near Buffy's ear and yanked her
back around. &quot;She's not important,&quot; he repeated. He gripped her by the
hips. &quot;My friends will teach her what she needs to know.&quot;</P>
<P>Willow screamed then, the sound panicked and angry, and Buffy twisted away
from Riley, breaking his hold as she spun around.</P>
<P>The camo-creeps had lifted Willow onto a pinball machine, and Parker was
standing next to her, only now he was dressed all in black.</P>
<P>&quot;Now, isn't this a revolting development?&quot; a soft voice whispered
near Buffy's ear. The Slayer glanced back into pale green eyes. It was the blond
who'd died in the Twenty-Four/Seven, a wry smile on her mouth, an ugly gash
still marring her midsection. &quot;Don't you think it's about time you get over
it and do the hero thing...before it's too late?&quot; she asked dryly, then she
disappeared as Riley stepped right through her.</P>
<P>&quot;Don't you get it, Buffy,&quot; he demanded, dressed all in camouflage
now. &quot;We belong together...and she's just in the way.&quot; He grabbed her
one more time at the same time that Willow screamed. Parker was climbing on top
of her, pulling back his fist to hit her.</P>
<P>And Buffy lost it. She slammed an elbow back into Riley's face, thrilled by
the satisfying crunch of bone that echoed through the Bronze's loudspeakers,
then leapt at the men holding Willow, to send them flying like tenpins. She hit,
punched, and kicked with raw ferocity, taking them all down with vicious glee
until Riley's voice pulled her up short.</P>
<P>&quot;You just don't get it,&quot; he growled, the words punctuated by
Willow's tiny cries and Buffy slowly turned to face him. He was dressed in black
now, an arm wrapped around Willow's slender body, a sharp stiletto pressed
against her throat. &quot;You don't have a choice in this...and if I have to
kill her to get that through your thick skull....&quot; He trailed the point of
the blade down Willow's torso. &quot;Then I guess that's just what I'm going to
have to do.&quot; He shoved the point of the blade upward under the bottom edge
of Willow's ribcage so hard he lifted her off her feet.</P>
<P>Buffy couldn't move. It was like she was caught in cold tar as she heard
Willow's agonized cry and saw the way her breath caught. The hacker's face
twisted with shock, while her blood spilled over the blade where it was thrust
into her body.</P>
<P>&quot;I was just following orders,&quot; Riley said and flung Willow's body
aside.</P>
<P>&quot;NO!!!&quot; Buffy's scream echoed back to her as felt the awful
paralysis lift and she leapt at him, tackling into his body, taking him down
hard. She pinned an arm across his throat, his answering gags music to her ears,
and chalked her fist back, fully intending to kill him.</P>
</I>
<P>But before she could strike, the scene wavered, colors running like wet paint
in the rain, slowly morphing into another scene: Willow staring up at her in
horror, her hands held protectively in front of her face, her eyes huge and
terrified in her face. The Slayer frowned, uncertain what was real and what
wasn't. She glanced around herself, spotting the familiar landmarks of her dorm
room--the desks, posters, Willow's open, dully glowing laptop, Mr. Gordo--then
back down at the woman lying pinned beneath her on her bed. &quot;Will?&quot;
she croaked at last and dropped her fist, self-consciously uncertain what to do
with it. A dream...it had just been a dream.</P>
<P>The two girls stared at each other, both breathing hard and shaking with
shock and fear.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, God...Will...&quot; Buffy exhaled heavily and yanked her arm back
from the hacker's throat, bracing it on the mattress near Willow's head. They
were lying stretched out on her bed, Willow closest to the wall, Buffy half on
top, pinning the hacker to the mattress. &quot;I...I was...dreaming... I
guess--&quot; By the look of it, she had grabbed her friend, attacking her in
place of the dream-Riley.</P>
<P>&quot;More like a nightmare,&quot; Willow coughed, her voice rough in the
wake of Buffy's choke hold. &quot;I...I was getting some work done when you
screamed... I just came to see what was wrong...&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy brushed a few strands of hair off of Willow's brow with a gentle hand.
&quot;I am <I>so </I>sorry,&quot; she croaked in a voice suddenly thick with
tears. &quot;I didn't even know it was you...I-I thought...I
thought...someone...was trying to hurt you...&quot; Without thinking, Buffy let
her head fall forward until her forehead was resting against Willow's upper
chest. &quot;...and I couldn't protect you...&quot; Her hands were braced
against the bed on either side of Willow's waist and she shifted them to cling
tightly to the hacker's slender frame. &quot;I tried...&quot; she whispered as
though still caught in the nightmare. She could feel salty tears sliding away
from the corners of her eyes. &quot;But I couldn't....&quot; She couldn't think
straight, still overwhelmed by the awful horror of the nightmare, the image of
Willow's dead body still burning brightly in her mind. She just needed to hold
on and reassure herself it wasn't real...that Willow was okay.</P>
<P>&quot;Buffy,&quot; Willow whispered and lifted a hand to the back of the
Slayer's head, ruffling her hair gently. &quot;It's okay...I'm okay...&quot; She
brought Buffy's head up with a light touch, stroking her cheek and then along
her brow, staring deeply into the Slayer's eyes as she tried to soothe her
fears. She felt the wetness of the Slayer's tears on her finger and stared at it
in awe. &quot;You...you're crying,&quot; she exhaled at last.</P>
<P>&quot;I couldn't handle it if anything happened to you,&quot; Buffy breathed,
her voice so soft Willow had to strain to hear her. The Slayer stared down into
the hacker's upturned face, taking in the softness of gamine features, the sweet
beauty of her worried expression. <I>Kiss the girl</I>, her inner voice urged,<I>
now, let her know how you feel</I>.</P>
<P>For once Buffy was too tired and too steeped in need to resist the siren's
song of her own hidden desires. With hungry passion, she ducked her head,
tasting soft lips. She felt Willow tense and gasp, and only pressed the kiss
deeper, drinking in her friend's startled breath.</P>
<P>The hacker whimpered low in her throat, momentarily confused, but Buffy just
kept kissing her until she was lost in the burst of heat that flooded her veins.
She arched up against the Slayer, instinctively seeking more contact. Had she
been less tired, or less depressed and in need of comfort, Willow might have
been able to resist the sweet temptation, but not at that moment. She needed the
closeness...the feeling of being loved. Willow surrendered completely to their
passion, working her fingers into thick blond hair as she pulled Buffy closer.</P>
<P>Warm curves neatly dovetailed together, the two girls kissed, caressed,
stroked and explored, the soft sounds of their lovemaking filling the room as
they surrendered to the need flooding through them in that instant. Buffy
pressed soft kisses into the valley between rounded breasts, stroked the curve
of Willow's hip, trailed her lips along the arch of the hacker's
ribcage--pressing tiny kisses over the precise spot where the dream-Willow had
taken the knife as though to wash away the imaginary injury--then slid back up,
shuddering and moaning softly as Willow's hands and lips slid over her skin
until she could barely breathe.</P>
<P>And for once, the voice in Buffy's head just sat back and applauded.</P>
