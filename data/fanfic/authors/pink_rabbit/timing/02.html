<p>Angel was bent over the latest page in what seemed like a truckload
of plans he'd analyzed. A sheet of jotted handwritten notes lay on one corner of the
table, mute testimony to the hours he'd put in hunting for an answer as to where Spike and
Drusilla had taken Willow. Unfortunately, while he had plenty of options, he hadn't found
a way to narrow them down and there were too many to cover in the amount of time they had
left.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, honey, if more vampires looked like you, they wouldn't
have to be nearly so rude when they bite people.&quot; The voice was honey smooth and
washed over him like a spring rain, sending a frisson of sexual awareness down the
vampire's spine as he spun, braced for combat.</p>

<p>Then gagged as he got a whiff of her breath. He didn't need to
breath, and for the first time he considered that a major advantage over humanity, though
even<i> his </i>eyes watered under the force of the smell as the seven foot tall,
crimson-fleshed, and even more crimson-haired, Peg-Bundy-wannabe entered his home.</p>

<p>She leaned against the doorjamb and struck a deliberately sensual
pose as she eyed him hungrily. &quot;Maybe you'd like to practice your technique on
me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not really, no,&quot; he admitted with something akin to
panic. Normally, he was the calmest of souls--already being dead will do that for a
person--but faced with a sexual come-on from the creature in front of him, even Angel
wasn't above running for cover.</p>

<p>Her lips O'ing in a disgusted pout, the succubus straightened.
&quot;Well, you're no fun,&quot; she complained, then her lips drew into a sensual smile.
&quot;Though I bet with a few centuries of effort, I could train you right.&quot;</p>

<p>Angel tamped down a shudder of revulsion at the idea and
straightened his shoulders to politely demand, &quot;Are you here for a reason?&quot; He
had to assume that she was the same succubus who had spoken to Buffy. It wasn't like they
were exactly common, even in Sunnydale. All things considered, that was a good thing.
There wasn't enough air freshener in the world to deal with the problem if a herd of them
entered the town.</p>

<p>The succubus blinked in surprise, used to more of a response one way
or the other from the male of the species, even when it was the male of the vampires
species. Still pouting, she puffed out her considerable chest as she faced him. &quot;I
hear you're looking for a certain redheaded tart, last seen with one
Melvinathoraxisthulixis?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Willow,&quot; Angel confirmed, his voice low. &quot;We're
looking for her. Do you know where she is?&quot; He studied the succubus carefully, hoping
for some insight into her actions, afraid it might be nothing more than a trap.</p>

<p>&quot;Do I know where she is?&quot; the creature repeated the
question in her honeyed drawl as she slowly paced the confines of the large room.</p>

<p>Angel wasn't ready for the fact that as she paced behind him a meaty
hand flashed out with inhuman speed and goosed him. The vampire jumped several feet,
landing with his dignity less than entirely intact. The succubus laughed, the sound
booming off of stone walls.</p>

<p>&quot;Possibly,&quot; she allowed as she faced Angel's outraged look
with a sultry grin. &quot;Wanna try and coax it out of me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How about I simply bash your head in instead?&quot; Buffy
demanded from where she stood in the open doorway, her blue eyes flashing with the fires
of rage, a glittery edged ax from Angel's personal collection gripped tightly in one hand.
Her hair and clothes were dirty and torn, her skin grimy and darkened by more than a few
bruises. She had not had a good day by any measure and now she'd arrived just in time to
see her sometimes boyfriend being sexually harassed by yet another demon hellbent on
complicating her life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The succubus spun, eyeing the Slayer with a look that bordered on
disdain. &quot;Oh, it's you again,&quot; she exhaled. &quot;Why don't you move along,
little girl. This is a game for adults.&quot;</p>

<p>Well past any ability to calmly discuss the situation, Buffy was on
her in a second, tackling into the taller form and slamming her into the wall at her back
so hard she left a demon shaped dent in the stones. The sharpened blade of the axe was
pressed against the demoness' massive throat before she even had a chance to blink.</p>

<p>&quot;Now,&quot; Buffy ground out. &quot;Where are they holding
Willow?&quot;</p>

<p>The succubus twisted in an effort to throw the Slayer off, but Buffy
wasn't in a reasonable mood and pressed the blade into her throat with supernatural
strength until a single bead of golden blood trailed onto the edge. &quot;I know a stake
can't kill you, but I'm betting decapitation will do some damage,&quot; she snarled.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; Angel said softly as he moved to kneel next to
them. &quot;I'm not sure she's our enemy.</p>

<p>&quot;What<i><b> he</b> </i>said,&quot; the succubus confirmed the
vampire's statement, her voice a hollow version of itself.</p>

<p>The Slayer eased the pressure on her throat ever so slightly.
&quot;Talk,&quot; she commanded through clenched teeth.</p>

<p>The creature beneath let out a nervous giggle that was choked off as
Buffy retightened her hold.</p>

<p>&quot;I said, <i>Talk</i>,'&quot; the Slayer reminded her.
&quot;Preferably about where your boyfriend is keeping Willow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is <i>not</i> my boyfriend,&quot; the succubus insisted
with outraged fury. &quot;That would be completely against all of the rules of the
guild...I just...I mean...okay, so we may have practiced a few techniques on each other,
but that doesn't mean that we've done anything against the rules--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't care!&quot; Buffy bellowed and shook the creature in
her grip, while Angel's eyes narrowed with sudden comprehension. He didn't know much about
succubi or incubi, but he had enough experience with demons to know there were rules to
the games they played. Rules, which, if broken, brought down a hefty punishment on the
betraying demon's head. &quot;<i>Where does he have Willow!?!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Angel caught his ex-lover's shoulder in a firm grip, staying her
rage for a moment. &quot;Buffy, don't you see, she's jealous of Willow. She doesn't want
this to happen any more than we do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You liar!&quot; the succubus snarled. &quot;You rotting
pustule on the ass of shit-eating, first-level, hecubus-worshipping, holy-water-drinking,
dust demon.&quot;</p>

<p>The insult took even Buffy aback for sheer bizarreness.</p>

<p>&quot;She's in love with him,&quot; Angel added with a knowing
smile, then added a laugh that sounded more like his evil counterpart Angelus.
&quot;That's very much against the rules in hell...isn't it, my dear? Wouldn't want your
boss to find out I'll bet.&quot;</p>

<p>The demoness was sweating now, bright golden beads that trailed over
her skin, her golden eyes bright with fear. &quot;It's not true,&quot; she insisted.
&quot;We wouldn't...I mean couldn't...&quot; She tried to cover her fear with poorly
played swaggering overconfidence. &quot;We're the sex demons of the underworld, Melvin and
I...why we--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't lie,&quot; Buffy snarled, cutting off the words with a
sharp bit of pressure on the axe blade as she picked up on Angel's discovery. &quot;Are
you in...love...with this demon, Melvinathoraxisthulixis? And I suggest you answer
honestly.&quot;</p>

<p>The succubus gulped and nodded slowly. &quot;Maybe a little,&quot;
she allowed, then flashed a nervous gaze around the room as though expecting a burst of
hellfire to devour her in an instant. &quot;I mean, we knew it was against the rules, but,
well, you've seen Melvin. How's a girl supposed to resist that?&quot; she wailed
plaintively.</p>

<p>Buffy sat back on her heels and turned a dumbfounded look Angel's
direction, silently pleading for some advice about what to do next.</p>

<p>Beneath her, the succubus' wail turned to a hiccuppy sob. &quot;But
now, he's got that redhead and once he's turned her, I'll never be able to compete...men
always go for a younger woman...and demons are no different...&quot; Fat gold tears
slipped out onto her cheeks, while Buffy found herself in the curious position of feeling
like she should offer her sympathies. &quot;He'll probably never even look at me
again.&quot; Angel offered the succubus a handkerchief and she dabbed at her tears, then
blew her nose into it. &quot;I just don't know what I'll do...I mean, my life hasn't been
the same since I met Melvin. I don't even do housecalls anymore.&quot; She blew her nose
again, then started to offer the hankie back to Angel. He politely refused.</p>

<p>&quot;Please, keep it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're a good boy,&quot; the succubus praised and dabbed at
more tears. &quot;But look at me, I can't even fake desire for another <i>demon</i> for
very long anymore, much less a human. If Melvin dumps me, I just don't know what I'll
do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then help us,&quot; Buffy broke in. &quot;If we can free
Willow, then you won't lose...Melvin.&quot;</p>

<p>The succubus sniffled loudly. &quot;Help humans? I don't know,&quot;
she fretted. &quot;I thought maybe if I gave you the clues, you'd get it on your own,
but...if the big guy ever found out I'd helped you,&quot; she shook her head worriedly.
&quot;It would make falling in,&quot; her voice dropped to a secretive whisper, &quot;<i>love</i>...seem
inconsequential by comparison--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't Melvinathoraxisthulixis worth the risk?&quot; Buffy
challenged. &quot;Or was this just some minor flirtation? Totally meaningless when you get
down to it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's not,&quot; the succubus insisted, then tried to
backtrack. &quot;It's just that...well...I mean ... humans ... working ... mortal ...
humans ... it's so ...&quot; she trailed off shaking her head.</p>

<p>&quot;It's that or lose him,&quot; Buffy challenged.</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; the succubus agreed at last.
&quot;I'll...I'll do it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, where are they?&quot; Buffy demanded.</p>

<p>&quot;Could you...um...get offa me?&quot; the succubus requested
politely, then carefully eased the blade away from her throat with the tip of a
well-manicured black fingernail.</p>

<p>Buffy eyed the creature with a raised brow. &quot;All right, but if
you try to run...&quot; she left off exactly what she'd do, but her tone made it clear it
wouldn't be pleasant. The Slayer bounded to her feet and stepped back a pace as she
continued to watch her prisoner with an eagle eye.</p>

<p>&quot;They're at the abandoned Yugo dealership in the automall at
the edge of town if you must know,&quot; the succubus explained as she climbed to her feet
and dusted off her ensemble. &quot;I'm Stelladvoratrellundar--Stella to my friends--by the
way,&quot; she introduced herself with a jaunty smile. Apparently, succubi and incubi were
both blessed with the sorts of personalities that didn't stay down for long. &quot;Anyway,
they were apparently expecting more sales than they got and it's got some kind of
underground garage that's just perfect for my Melvin.&quot; A breathy sigh punctuated the
comment.</p>

<p>Buffy couldn't withhold a smirk. &quot;Spike in a closed Yugo
dealership. How appropriate.&quot; And then she was all business once again. Outside, the
sun hadn't quite set. It would be at least another 20 or 30 minutes before Angel could
move safely, but apparently, the succubus wasn't so encumbered since she'd gotten to the
mansion in the first place. Buffy grabbed her arm. &quot;Come on, you're going to take me
there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; Angel exhaled, intending to argue.</p>

<p>Buffy cut him off in a hard voice. &quot;I need you to get back to
the library and get Giles...we'll need him.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Willow was burning up, her breath coming in tortured pants, her skin
flushed with fever. &quot;I don't want this,&quot; she groaned, shivers of pain and
awareness rattling through her delicate frame.</p>

<p>A massive hand gently stroked sweat damp hair back from her brow.</p>

<p>&quot;Tender tasty pretty,&quot; Drusilla's mad sing-song echoed
through the room and the demon bounded to massive feet, sending plaster down on her head.
She batted angrily at it. &quot;Bad, bad incubus,&quot; she chastised, sounding for all
the world like a society matron with a particularly recalcitrant Pekingese.</p>

<p>His head tipped to one side, gold eyebrows lifting in open
confusion. &quot;You are one crazy chick,&quot; he exhaled, the fumes from his breath
enough to wilt even Drusilla's dead flower bouquet.</p>

<p>She tittered happily and glided toward him, her game face in place.
&quot;Hungry for pretties,&quot; she exhaled, her sharp incisors glinting in the pale
light cast by the single bulb that illuminated the room. Her eyes fell on the
semi-conscious figure of the young hacker stretched out on the cot. &quot;Very
hungry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But...like...if you eat the chickie, it's gonna be mighty hard
for me to do a horizontal boogeloo, babe. ...'know what I mean?&quot; The incubus tried to
redirect her attention, but Drusilla's mind--such as it was--was on other pursuits. He
surreptitiously glanced toward the door, trying to discover whether she was alone, or if
Spike was hiding somewhere in the shadows.</p>

<p>&quot;I haven't eaten all day,&quot; the vampire giggled.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, you don't want the staff, go for it.&quot;</p>

<p>Drusilla pulled up short, her expression momentarily blank.
&quot;The staff?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The staff of Eldrad...walk in the sunlight...power beyond
measure and all that,&quot; he reminded her.</p>

<p>Drusilla brightened, her mad gaze unblinking as she smiled in
remembrance. &quot;I always loved the sun...I used to dance and pick flowers in the
spring.&quot; Then she began dancing, her skirts sweeping about her in the discarded
storage room. &quot;And we'd waltz at the Spring dance, round and round and round' we'd
go...beautifully dressed ladies and gentlemen....flowers...and the bright beautiful sun in
the sky overhead.&quot;</p>

<p>Gleaming gold eyebrows lifted in polite disbelief as she calmly
waltzed right out of the place, leaving the doors to his makeshift cell wide open.
&quot;Now, that is one batty broad,&quot; Melvin exhaled with a slow shake of his heavy
horns. &quot;On the other hand, never look a gift demon in the maw.&quot; Turning back, he
glanced at the slender figure twisting on the small cot, then swung her up without
thought. He was just starting back toward the open doors when he heard the mad titters of
Drusilla's laughter and they slammed shut. The demon leapt at them, hammering with a huge
fist, but they were solid steel, and she managed to slide the bolt just in time. He heard
the sound of the chains being replaced and hammered again, but it was no use. Growling
under his breath so loudly even he was annoyed by the amount of dust the noise brought
down on his head, he twisted and sank down into a sitting position, his tiny charge draped
across his lap.</p>

<p>Willow stirred weakly. &quot;Wha' happened?&quot; she groaned,
leaning heavily against his chest.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing you need to worry about,&quot; he mumbled, then
groaned as she shifted on his lap, looking up at him blearily.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm starting to like the fuzzies,&quot; Willow exhaled and
reached up to touch his face. &quot;Cute fuzzies,&quot; she breathed, surprised to find
that her chest no longer hurt. In fact her body was starting to feel surprisingly light,
like it never had in the past. And her kidnapper wasn't at all what one would expect in a
demon. As her vision fought to clear itself, she found herself enjoying what little she
could make out of his features. &quot;You know, you're not so bad now that I think about
it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Damn,&quot; Melvin groaned low in his throat as delicate
fingers traced a cord in his throat. &quot;Not yet,&quot; he ground out. She shifted again
and the demon whimpered, then snapped to his feet, sending his small burden crashing to
the ground. &quot;Sorry kid,&quot; he apologized instantly. &quot;But we've still got a
little time and--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't worry about it,&quot; Willow drawled and pushed to her
knees. &quot;In fact I kind of liked it--&quot;</p>

<p>The demon cursed in an ancient language and leapt straight into the
air, his horns leaving a considerable dent in the ceiling before he landed several feet
away. &quot;Now, kid...&quot; He wagged a meaty crimson finger in a naughty-naughty
gesture. &quot;You don't want this, remember?&quot;</p>

<p>Willow shrugged as she pushed to her feet. Yes, she was feeling much
better now...and it was all his doing. &quot;Mmm, silly me...I meant to say I <i>do</i>
want it.&quot; At some level, she knew what she was feeling wasn't real and wasn't right,
but she couldn't seem to stop herself.</p>

<p>Melvin swallowed hard, gleaming gold eyes running over the young
woman's frame, noting the curves that invited man or demon to touch and caress. He slapped
himself hard. &quot;Nononono...you are not going to touch her...there's still time
left...and if you touch that, you are single for all eternity...&quot;</p>

<p>Full lips like sunkissed strawberries drew into a sensual smile.
&quot;Lots of time,&quot; Willow agreed, striding toward him, her gait reminiscent of the
most experienced of strippers. Gypsy Rose Lee had nothing on this girl.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh Hell,&quot; Melvin muttered, unable to take his eyes from
the sight of the young woman striding toward him. He'd never been meant for fidelity.
Hell, he'd been created for exactly the opposite purpose. A tiny whimper escaped from his
lips. This whole relationship thing was proving harder than he'd ever expected. He
couldn't help but wonder how humans did it. &quot;No, no,&quot; he chastised himself.
&quot;Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, Vespasian,
Titus, Domitian, Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian...&quot; he rattled off until he felt the fierce
arousal recede slightly. &quot;...ahhh, that's better,&quot; he sighed and stuck out an
arm, intercepting Willow and keeping her at arms' length as he pushed her back toward the
cot.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, good,&quot; Willow enthused. &quot;Are you sure you
wouldn't prefer right here...I like floors...&quot; she added, looking back up at him
through shining eyes.</p>

<p>Melvin offered a weak smile as he shoved her down onto the mattress.
&quot;Believe me, honey, it'll be much better on the cot...just stay right there, while I
go over...there...&quot; He backed away careful not to touch her again as he hooked a
thumb toward the opposite side of the room.</p>

<p>&quot;But, I don't see--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Trust me, kiddo. This will really make it all so much
better.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow's lips rounded in disappointment. &quot;If you say so.&quot;
She stretched out on the narrow mattress, unconsciously--or maybe consciously--letting him
get a good look at supple curves.</p>

<p>&quot;Antonius Pius, Marcus Aurelius, Lucius Aurelius Verus,
Commodus, Pertinax, Didus Julian, Septimius Severus....&quot;God, her precious Slayer had
better come soon, because he only had a few hundred years of Roman Emperors left.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</p>

<p>&quot;I don't see why you should be the one to sneak in,&quot;
Stelladvoratrellundar complained.</p>

<p>The Slayer barely spared her a glance as she continued watching the
dilapidated building a short distance away. No sign of any vampish guards, but all of the
local wildflowers were wilting and dying. Either Melvin had been in the area, killing off
the plant life with the B.O. from hell, or somebody'd been spraying with DDT.
&quot;Because,&quot; she explained impatiently, &quot;somebody needs to sneak in and
something needs to make distracting noises. All things considered, I'm more the sneaking
type, and you....&quot; She ran her eyes over Stella's ample curves. &quot;You are
definitely more the distracting type.&quot;</p>

<p>Stella plumped her hair and bosom at the same time by some trick of
physics the Slayer didn't completely understand. &quot;Why, thank you, honey.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anytime,&quot; Buffy demurred, then started to creep toward
the abandoned Yugo dealership, only to have rock hard hand on wrist bring her up short.</p>

<p>&quot;Remember, don't hurt Melvin,&quot; the succubus hissed,
&quot;or the deal's off.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy twisted her wrist free, grateful that the succubus apparently
didn't have her boyfriend's brute strength. She couldn't afford to tell the whole truth,
namely that she would cheerfully sacrifice her precious Melvin if that's what it took to
save Willow. &quot;Look, according to you, he's as much a prisoner as Willow...and my plan
is to free anyone who wants to be freed, okay?&quot; she grabbed the double-bladed axe
she'd gotten at Angel's and straightened. &quot;Now, remember what I told you to tell
Angel and the others.&quot;</p>

<p>Stella nodded. &quot;Sheez, I'm not stupid, don't worry, I'll
remember.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good,&quot; Buffy muttered. &quot;Just give me a couple of
minutes to get close.&quot;</p>

<p>Stella watched as the Slayer disappeared into the darkness.
&quot;Now, was that wait until they hear from her, or just go ahead and do the necessary
ceremony?&quot; She shook her head. &quot;Oh well, they'll figure it out.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Much to Angel's surprise, Giles insisted on leaving Oz and Xander
behind. Both boys had protested, but the librarian had been firm. Oz and Xander were not
needed and they <i>would</i> not be coming along. In fact he had even tried to make Angel
stay behind until the vampire made it clear that he would either go with Giles or on his
own, but he would be going. The librarian had given in, but he hadn't been happy about it.</p>

<p>Riding in Giles' car in uncomfortable silence, the vampire stared at
the carved jaw of Buffy's Watcher. Something much more than mere fear was affecting him.
He knew the other man wasn't overly fond of him--and really, he couldn't blame him. The
demon that lived inside his skin had murdered this man's lover and tortured him. Hardly
minor offenses. Still, for the love of Buffy and the necessity of working together to
destroy the myriad of creatures that threatened the safety of the world, they had both
struggled to come to some kind of peace with each other. Sensing something very wrong
going on, he'd tried asking what was going on in any number of different ways, but Giles
had simply ignored his efforts.</p>

<p>Hence, the vampire was surprised when Giles looked over as he pulled
to a halt at a stop light and spoke just loudly enough to be heard above the sound his car
engine. &quot;You've heard of the Millennial Prophecies of the Watcher's Council?&quot; he
said by way of question.</p>

<p>Angel frowned, surprised by the question and not understanding its
relevance to the situation. &quot;Rumors,&quot; he admitted. &quot;Most vampires hear them
sooner or later. I've never put much stock in them though.&quot;</p>

<p>Giles' head swung back around so he was staring out the front
windshield and when he spoke, his tone was grim. &quot;There <i>are</i> prophecies and the
council <i>does</i> believe in them.&quot; Long, tapered fingers tapped randomly on the
steering wheel. &quot;They live by them,&quot; he hissed as much to himself as Angel.</p>

<p>&quot;Giles, I don't understand,&quot; the vampire exhaled
uncertainly. &quot;What's going on?&quot;</p>

<p>The Watcher stripped off his eyeglasses and massaged the bridge of
his nose tiredly. &quot;The prophecies speak of a Slayer who will one day topple the
council...there are signs...portents....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, and that has what to do with Willow's kidnapping,
how?&quot; Angel liked Willow. She was a good kid and a true friend to the Slayer. He knew
how much Buffy needed her and was determined to help bring her home. He'd hurt so many
people in his life, including Willow; it was the least he could do to try and set things
right.</p>

<p>&quot;Because,&quot; Giles began hesitantly, visibly not wanting to
continue. &quot;I learned something tonight--in the course of researching this
case--something I cannot allow the council to discover...a sign if you will...that Buffy
might be the very Slayer they so fear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Angel exhaled uncertainly. &quot;I'm still not
sure I understand what that has to do with this situation.&quot;</p>

<p>Giles shook his head. &quot;Directly...nothing...indirectly...a
great deal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're not making a lot of sense here, Giles,&quot; Angel said
worriedly. He remembered the tension he'd seen in Buffy, the sense that there were secrets
she was keeping. Now Giles was doing the same thing, and he could feel the fear building.
In his two hundred plus years, he'd learned that fear was never a good sign.</p>

<p>Giles massaged his temple. &quot;You know about the festival?&quot;
Giles questioned. &quot;The need for a virgin sacrifice to an incubus to retrieve the
staff?&quot;</p>

<p>Angel nodded. &quot;I've heard about it,&quot; he allowed. &quot;I
figured that's why Willow.&quot; He shrugged, masculine knowledge radiating through his
attitude. He'd been around a lot of women in the course of his life and death. Seducing
the innocent had been his personal specialty; the demon inside had found the most pleasure
in the art of corruption. He knew all of the signs.</p>

<p>&quot;Well...yes...&quot; Giles muttered. &quot;Only one small
problem, according to Buffy she might not be--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wouldn't Xander or Oz be more likely to know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not in this case,&quot; Giles exhaled. He took a deep breath
and turned to focus on the other man. &quot;Apparently Buffy and Willow have done a bit of
experimenting...the case for virginity is somewhat in question.&quot;</p>

<p>It took a moment for exactly what Giles was telling him to sink in.
Angel blinked, his face an expressionless mask. &quot;I see.&quot; He'd seen too much in
his life to be entirely surprised. It hurt certainly, but he'd always known Buffy would
move on, and in some ways it was easier to think of her with Willow than some strange man.
Willow had already carved out her own niche in the Slayer's heart. She wouldn't have to
take his. &quot;I didn't know,&quot; he added needlessly, though his hands fisted at his
sides as he struggled with the hurt. There was no time for his emotional foibles under the
circumstances.</p>

<p>&quot;And if the council finds out, they won't ask questions, they
won't debate, they'll simply kill them...both.&quot; Giles' tone was flat with an
underlying sense of horror that sent goosebumps down Angel's spine. The light turned green
and the small car surged forward.</p>

<p>&quot;You can't be serious,&quot; the vampire hissed at last.
&quot;She's their damn Slayer.&quot;</p>

<p>Giles glanced over. &quot;Very serious...I've been a little worried
about this--not Buffy and Willow, but Faith...before she joined the mayor--and I've done
the research. I'd heard rumors for years, but didn't pay much attention. After what I've
discovered, I've reason to believe they've already killed two Slayers to make certain the
prophecy doesn't come true.&quot;</p>

<p>A muscle worked in Angel's jaw, his expression twisting with
distaste. That was the sort of thing he expected from his own kind, not those supposedly
charged with protecting the world. &quot;What do we do?&quot; he questioned grimly.</p>

<p>&quot;We protect them...from themselves if necessary.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Buffy heard the huge crash and saw Spike and Drusilla go running to
see what the sound was. She slipped into their none too tasteful abode the moment they
were past her, and dropped down, landing lightly. She still carried the axe she'd borrowed
from Angel's weapons stash, and Mr. Pointy was tucked into his familiar inner jacket
pocket. The first basement had a wide open area apparently meant as a secondary storage
area as well as various smaller rooms that looked to have been offices and smaller supply
storage rooms. She bypassed those without a second glance, trusting the twitch in her nose
that her prey wasn't in them. She hurried on, following a narrow corridor that seemed
slightly smellier than the rest. She'd often said she could sniff out a demon, but for the
first time it was literally true.</p>

<p>She found a door marked stairway, and had to bite back on vicious
cough as she opened it. &quot;This has got to be the place,&quot; she muttered, then
grabbed a kerchief from her jacket pocket, tying it around her face in an effort to block
out the worst of the fumes. It was like trying to ride out a tidal wave in a rubber raft,
but it at least blunted the worst of the stench enough to let her move down into the near
darkness without coughing with every step.</p>

<p>The only illumination on the narrow stairwell was a single bulb
trapped in an industrial cage. There were other lights as she moved downward, but they'd
all been broken out. Endless amounts of graffiti decorated the walls in mute testimony to
the way it had been used for awhile after being abandoned. She couldn't help but wonder if
the kids who'd apparently made this their personal clubhouse for a time had survived the
experience or if they'd succumbed to the vampires who'd followed.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, as she moved lower, the smell seemed to thin, as
though it was some kind of gas that tended to float. She'd gone down three floors when the
staircase finally ended in a narrow corridor, while the smell worsened once again.
Obviously Melvinathoraxisthulixis was in the vicinity. Buffy hefted her axe a little
higher, readying to use it if need be as she entered the corridor.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the darkness, something howled as if pain, and the
Slayer tightened her grip on the weapon. The corridor widened out after only a few yards
and she found herself facing a broad set of double doors that had been deadbolted,
chained, and blockaded. The smell was mind-numbing.</p>

<p>&quot;Looks like the place,&quot; she muttered.</p>

<p>Another roar echoed in the distance, though it seemed farther down
another darkened corridor, and the Slayer momentarily debated her next course of action.
She had just over an hour left before the party was due to begin, which was cutting it way
too close for her comfort. Another roar and she started a step down the alternate
corridor.</p>

<p>And then she heard a scream. High pitched, horrified, and coming
from behind the chained doors, it was still in full throttle when the Slayer pitched
herself at the doors, hurling aside a desk that had been used as a blockade, then throwing
the deadbolt. The chains were locked with a padlock, so she simply raised the heavy,
double-bladed ax over her head and brought it down with every last ounce of her strength.</p>

<p>It sliced through the chains with a grinding of sparks and she
batted them out of the way just as another scream--more a squeal this time--and a series
of ground-rattling thuds shook the world. &quot;I'm going to enjoy killing you,&quot; she
snarled as she kicked the doors wide. &quot;I'm here, Will,&quot; she called out, braced
and ready for combat, the axe gripped in both hands for maximum leverage.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, thank Hells you've come.&quot; The words were more or less
the ones she expected to hear, but the voice was all wrong. Deep and throbbing, like a
sonic boom, it washed over her, then trailed off into another high-pitched squeal.</p>

<p>The Slayer stood gape-mouthed as she realized that the demon she'd
come to kill was lying on the floor curled up into a ...well, not a tiny ball, but a ball,
his hands protectively over the more intimate parts of his body, while her best friend
appeared to be tickling him.</p>

<p>It was, to say the least, not at all what she expected to find.</p>

<p>&quot;For Demon's sake, get her offa me,&quot; the incubus begged as
he twisted, trying to escape the delicate fingers teasing his flesh.</p>

<p>Buffy tore the impromptu face mask down as she shouted,
&quot;Will!&quot; She started forward, only to pull up short as Willow slow rose and
pivoted to face her, her green eyes almost seeming to burn in the faint light. Willow had
always had an inch or two on Buffy height-wise, but suddenly, she had more like six or
eight, while her hair seemed to flare like a living flame, and her skin had an odd opal
glow even in the dirty amber light cast by the single bulb. The Slayer's voice was little
more than a thin exhalation as she whispered, &quot;Will?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hello, Buffy,&quot; Willow drawled, her eyes running over her
friend in a way that made the Slayer very aware of the things they'd done together that
one night. She felt her body shudder with remembered arousal as her pulse picked up. This
was just way too weird, leaving her uncertain how to react. She backed up a half step,
unable to look away as Willow started toward her, her hips swaying in a way that just
invited a lover's touch.</p>

<p>The demon Melvinathoraxisthulixis lay on the floor, his shoulders
heaving. &quot;Hate being tickled,&quot; he mumbled weakly. &quot;Absolutely no fair
tickling. What's a demon s'posed to do against tickling?&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy fell back another step, her eyes widening as she stared at
this new rendition of her best friend. &quot;Will, stay back,&quot; she panted, backing
away until her shoulderblades hit a nearby wall. &quot;I don't want to hurt you,&quot; she
rasped.</p>

<p>Willow's smile broadened ever so slightly and she kept coming.
&quot;Of course you don't,&quot; she agreed. Her smile spread into a wicked expression.
&quot;At least not in a bad way.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy swallowed hard, trying to think of a way to make Willow stop
coming that didn't involve the ax. She was still considering the problem when Willow
batted the weapon aside, knocking it out of her hands to send it skittering across the
uneven cement floor and leaving Buffy's fingers numb from the force behind the almost
playful blow.</p>

<p>&quot;Dear God, Will--&quot; Buffy gasped, and tried to push her
friend back only to have her wrists caught by impossibly strong fingers.
&quot;Don't,&quot; she groaned, writhing as Willow pressed her hands into the wall over
her head. She remembered the strength of the creature she'd faced before. He'd taken her
down with painful ease and now Willow was doing the same thing. She had to force down a
sob as she realized that she was too late. Her friend was already a demon. A rage borne
kick glanced off of rounded hips.</p>

<p>&quot;Lotsa good hurting to be done though,&quot; Willow added,
using her body to press Buffy harder against the wall, her nearness making the Slayer's
head swim with a dozen kinds of awareness that had nothing with the stark raving terror
and anger she should be feeling. It was just so tempting to lose herself in her friend's
beauty, release herself to the demons, and stop fighting. She watched with wide eyes as
Willow canted her head. Somewhere in the distance something roared out its hate, but Buffy
Summers no longer cared.</p>

<p>Crimson lips dipped closer and Buffy's eyes slid closed. Fine. At
least they'd be together.</p>

<p>The thud was heavy, just the exact timbre of a meaty fist finding a
thick skull, and then Buffy was free. Her eyes snapped open while her friend was still
toppling to the floor. Her chin lifted until her eyes met a sparked golden gaze set in
uneven and truly hideous features. She blinked in surprise as she realized that her savior
almost certainly had to be the demon. <i>Dear God, Willow.</i> Her gaze dropped to her
fallen friend and she fell to one knee beside, automatically reaching for her throat,
needing to know if she was even still alive.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't worry,&quot; the demon's booming voice assaulted her
ears. &quot;That little tap didn't hurt her. I'm Melvinathoraxisthulixis. You must be
Buffy...the vampire Slayer.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy ignored the friendly greeting. Silky hair spread across her
fingers as she found the pulse in Willow's throat. She didn't know whether it was a good
sign or a bad one that it was pounding an uneven rhumba beat. &quot;Okay?&quot; the Slayer
croaked, wanting to scream, but barely able to force any air past the constriction in her
throat. &quot;She's a goddamned demon now!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Naw,&quot; the creature disagreed and crouched down to face
her. &quot;She's close...changing...but not there yet...it's not midnight, so no
ceremony...yet.&quot;</p>

<p>As Buffy watched in confusion, he closed his eyes, inhaling deeply.
&quot;Stell...Demons, I love that perfume...&quot; the demon whispered, then his burnished
gold eyes snapped open again. &quot;You've seen her. I can smell her perfume on your
clothes.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy wouldn't have defined any of the smells associated with Stella
as perfume, but didn't argue.</p>

<p>&quot;We gotta get outa here,&quot; he insisted in a voice now
riddled with hope and started to reach for Willow.</p>

<p>Buffy thrust his hand aside before he could make contact.
&quot;Don't you touch her.&quot;</p>

<p>The demon sat back on his heels. &quot;Look, kid, we gotta get outa
here...otherwise fangboy gets his fondest dream...and my girlfriend never speaks to me
again.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy just stared for a moment as she concluded that as demons went,
she preferred vampires to incubi. At least with vampires, she knew where she stood. She
was still trying to decide how to answer when another of the roars she'd heard outside the
storage room echoed off the walls. Slayer and incubus both snapped to their feet, staring
toward the double doors into the huge room.</p>

<p>Another roar, closer this time.</p>

<p>Demon and Slayer looked at each other.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't suppose he's with you?&quot; Melvin said hopefully.</p>

<p>Dark blond brows lifted, then Buffy swung wide eyes toward the open
door and swallowed hard. &quot;I was just about to ask you the same thing.&quot; She swung
her head back around. &quot;You said Willow's not a demon yet?&quot; she demanded
raggedly.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; he confirmed.</p>

<p>&quot;Then it's reversible?&quot;</p>

<p>Melvin shrugged a broad shoulder. &quot;Under the right
circumstances.&quot;</p>

<p>Another roar rattled the ceiling overhead. Whatever the hell was out
there, it was not in a good mood.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Melvin appeared to be at least reasonably harmless. Buffy
made a fast decision then ducked down and reached for Willow's arm to drag her up over one
shoulder in a fireman's carry. &quot;We'll talk about it outside,&quot; she clipped, then
grunted as she bore all of her friend's weight. She tensed when Melvin retrieved her ax,
but he only handed it back to her with a distasteful expression.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, I really don't do weapons.&quot; His manner was almost
prissy, which would have been damn funny under different circumstances. After all, it's
not often one runs into a nine foot tall, ram-horned, crimson demon, that handles an ax in
a nervous two fingered grip.</p>

<p>Buffy took the weapon with a grunt. &quot;Let's go.&quot; She led
the way, staggering slightly under Willow's increased weight.</p>

<p>They exited the storage room and makeshift prison together, Buffy
only slightly in front, and were heading toward the stairs to the ground floor when the
roar overtook them, so loud and violent that it nearly shook Buffy off her feet. She felt
a hard hand steady her elbow as she spun, and was nearly knocked down a second time, this
time by the smell that accompanied the roar. Buffy gagged, violently. It had never
occurred to her that any odor in the entire universe could make the smell of Melvin's
breath seem sweet by comparison, but there it was. She blinked at the tears suddenly
filling her eyes, forcing the world back into reasonable focus.</p>

<p>And then wished she hadn't.</p>

<p>Because sweet smelling wasn't the only thing the newcomer made
Melvin seem by comparison. He also made him appear downright handsome, well groomed, and
the sort of guy a girl would want to bring home to meet her mother. At least two feet
taller than Melvin, with black crystalline skin that appeared to glitter as it moved,
flaring a spectrum of colors across its bulky, muscle bound chest. The thing's proportions
were all wrong, the arms too long, the hands oversized, and the legs blunted and overly
thick. A face to inspire nightmares was topped by gnarled intertwined horns that resembled
some kind of elk exposed to far too much radiation. Like Melvin, it was naked. Unlike
Melvin, Buffy didn't recognize most of the parts she saw.</p>

<p>&quot;You've been a very bad boy, Melvinathoraxisthulixis,&quot; the
thing said, the uneven gobbering lips barely moving in synch with the booming, raspy
words.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, this is bad,&quot; the incubus exhaled and backed up a
step, bumping into Buffy, who nearly went sprawling. &quot;Now would be a good time to
run,&quot; he added needlessly.</p>

<p>Buffy wholeheartedly agreed with that sentiment and pivoted neatly,
quite ready to lunge up the stairs out of the building. It was a good plan, with only one
drawback.</p>

<p>When Buffy leaned forward and peered up through the center shaft,
she could just glimpse Spike and Drusilla on the landing a mere two flights up.
&quot;Problem,&quot; she snarled at Melvin. &quot;Fangboy and loony tunes are on their
way. Can you take them out?&quot;</p>

<p>Melvin shook his head. &quot;They summoned me. I can't raise a hand
to them....&quot;</p>

<p>And Buffy wasn't up to fighting both of them in close quarters.
After twenty four hours of steady stress and more than a little combat, she was in no
condition for any more fighting than was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>&quot;You won't be raising a hand to anything when I'm done with
you,&quot; the black demon roared and burst forward.</p>

<p>A locked door centered one side of the landing and Melvin hit it
with his closed fist, tearing the hollow core door off its hinges and shredding the flimsy
lock in one move. &quot;Go!&quot; he snarled and shoved Buffy through first, then followed
hard on her heels.</p>

<p>&quot;YOU CAN'T ESCAPE ME, MELVINATHORAXISTHULIXIS!!!&quot; the
black demon roared, his footsteps rocking the world around them.</p>

<p>Melvin spun back, hammering a huge fist into the ceiling and
bringing cement and plaster down in his wake, while Buffy continued fleeing down the
darkened corridor. She hit a door and pulled up short, then backed up a half step and
delivered an adrenaline powered kick that nearly tore it off its hinges. The incubus
wasn't the only one who could do a bit of damage. &quot;Come on!&quot; she called back as
she hurried through.</p>

<p>Melvin bounded through a pace behind her and shoved the remains of
the door closed, quickly knocking half the corridor in to keep it that way. &quot;Go,
go,&quot; he hissed and pushed Buffy forward, clamping a hand on her shoulder and pressing
her deeper into the darkness.</p>

<p>&quot;You can see in the dark, can't you?&quot; she hissed as they
made several neat turns under his guidance.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm a demon. We're created in darkness...we live, breathe,
sleep and die in darkness...so...yeah...I can see in the dark,&quot; her companion
confirmed as he suddenly stepped past her. She heard the sound of soft taps on a hollow
surface.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, this is too good,&quot; Melvin decided out loud, then
explained to her, &quot;The wall's hollow...there's something back there...or more
correctly, there's nothing back there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What the hell was that thing...the tall black guy with the
horns, I mean?&quot; Buffy panted and adjusted the limp burden hanging on her shoulder to
relieve the strain. Whatever other changes were obviously afoot, transforming into a demon
was more than doubling her friend's weight.</p>

<p>&quot;Enforcer Demon,&quot; Melvin clipped and then hammered the
wall, tearing out a fair chunk of cement in one blow. &quot;I've broken a few rules
lately.&quot; Another blow and more cement crumbled. Almost enough for a human to get
through the resulting hole. &quot;And it's his job to do something about it.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head, so tired his words were threatening to jumble
together. &quot;What does a demon like you have to do to get into trouble?&quot; she
snorted.</p>

<p>A long moment of total silence passed. &quot;Fall in love,&quot; he
answered at last.</p>

<p>Buffy was surprised by the sincerity of the emotion. &quot;Stella
mentioned something about that,&quot; she admitted. She tightened her hold on the young
woman slung over her shoulder, suddenly remembering what this was all about in the quiet
moment. She activated the light on her watch, flinching as she saw the time. Just over a
half an hour to go. &quot;It's almost time...You've got to release Willow now,&quot; she
whispered, her voice taking on a pleading note.</p>

<p>He tore out another slab of cement as he answered, &quot;I
can't.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy felt her stomach muscles clench with impending nausea.
&quot;You said it's reversible,&quot; she accused. &quot;That you'd release her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I said it's reversible,&quot; the incubus confirmed. &quot;Not
that I can release her....&quot; He heaved another hunk aside.</p>

<p>Exhausted, battered, scared, and pushed to the limit, Buffy
carefully settled her unconscious friend back on the floor and tested the weight of the
ax. &quot;Release her,&quot; she growled, her tone threat personified. She heard the heavy
sounds of footsteps as Melvin turned. &quot;Or you'll be going straight back to hell one
way or the other.&quot;</p>

<p>A long moment of silence followed, then his deep voice rattled the
walls at a sibilant whisper-pitch. &quot;This isn't helping the situation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe not, but you should understand that if my friends don't
hear from me before midnight, they'll do what they have to do to send your sex-crazed ass
right back to hell,&quot; Buffy snarled, hating the idea with all her heart, but knowing
that Giles would do what was necessary to save the world. She swallowed back the threat of
tears at the idea, but knew that it was what even Willow would choose if she could.</p>

<p>The demon frowned, staring at her with an odd look, then suddenly
his head canted to one side as he studied her expression, reading it with an unerring
skill developed over several thousand years of seducing humans. &quot;Demons...you're not
sure if she's a virgin,&quot; he said in a burst of insight. &quot;Which means your
friends will assume she isn't....&quot; He shook his massive head. &quot;It'll kill
her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe,&quot; Buffy allowed, &quot;and maybe not...there seems
to be some question about that...but if it does, she'll die with her soul intact.&quot; It
was a bluff, at least Buffy prayed it was. She wasn't sure if any of them, herself
included, could go through with the threat if it came down to it.</p>

<p>&quot;I suspect she'd rather not die at all,&quot; the demon growled
unhappily.</p>

<p>&quot;But I know her, she'd rather die than exist as a demon,&quot;
Buffy snarled, thrusting her chin forward pugnaciously. &quot;Now, if you care so much,
tell me how to free her!&quot; The Slayer didn't know the blow was coming until it caught
her alongside the head. She went skidding across the floor, and didn't stop until she the
opposite wall.</p>

<p>&quot;I like the kid,&quot; the demon growled, genuine anger
threading through his deep voice. &quot;And I <b><i>love</i></b> Stella, so you can
believe I do <i>not</i> want this to happen...but, there are fricking rules even for
demons! Got it Slayer?!&quot; Plaster dust rained down on them, coating them all in a
thick layer of white powder. After being summoned, locked up, tempted, tickled, and now
chased by an Enforcer Demon, Melvinathoraxisthulixis had officially had it. He punched a
huge finger into Buffy's chest as she climbed to her feet, nearly knocking her right back
on her backside. &quot;And one of those rules is that I can't tell you the damn rules for
undoing an incubi's spell!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rules?!&quot; Buffy bellowed right back at him, though at a
considerably lesser volume. &quot;You don't want to do your 'demonly duty,' you've even
fallen in love! There's an Enforcer Demon who wants to rip off your head and shove it down
your throat! And now you're worrying about the rules!? How much worse can it get?!&quot;</p>

<p>Melvin drew breath to give her a scathing answer.</p>

<p>And paused.</p>

<p>&quot;Actually, you have a point,&quot; he admitted after a long
beat, doing another one of the emotional about-faces that Buffy was beginning to believe
were just par for the course for this particular brand of demon. &quot;I mean, it hadn't
really occurred to me,&quot; he murmured, sounding embarrassed. &quot;But, it's not like
it would make things any worse--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever,&quot; Buffy's harsh voice sliced through his
comments. &quot;Now,&quot; she demanded desperately, &quot;how do I release her?&quot;</p>

<p>A short moment of silence followed the question, and then he
answered seriously. &quot;True love's kiss...like the old fairy tales...she mentioned some
guy named Oz...anyway, I've always wondered if that's why--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Quiet!&quot; Buffy snarled, then her voice turned desperate.
&quot;Oh God, how'm I supposed to get her to Oz in time?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dig,&quot; Melvin suggested as he went back to clearing a
tunnel into the passageway on the other side of the corridor. &quot;It looks like this
opens into some kind of natural passageway. This whole area's riddled with limestone
caves, so there's a good shot it leads to the surface.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy stood helplessly, barely aware of her surroundings, hurting so
badly she couldn't think straight. She was going to fail. She was going to lose Willow.
And worst of all, she was going to lose her because she couldn't get to her true
love--Oz--in time to have the spell broken by true love's kiss. Buffy felt nauseous. She
could hear the heavy thuds of Melvin clearing the way into the cave, and turned blindly
toward the sound, wishing her magic Slayer powers included the ability to see in the dark.
She hadn't gone a step when a heavy hand landed on her shoulder from behind. &quot;Melvin,
I...&quot; and then it occurred to her that the incubus was still heaving concrete
aside--in front of her. The Slayer pivoted on one foot, eyes lifting in the total
darkness, breath catching in her throat as she realized she suddenly could see something
and it took her breath away.</p>

<p>Glowing green eyes looked down at her, the faint light reflecting
off flaming red hair and opalescent flesh. &quot;Hello, Buffy,&quot; Willow drawled and
full lips drew into a wicked smile.</p>

<p>The Slayer stood frozen in place, unable to even force the air from
her lungs as a long-fingered hand lifted to her hair, slipping into the pale blond
strands. &quot;Will?&quot; she managed to gasp at last. She knew she should run, fight, do
something, but she was caught in the trap of those eyes. Her body was already reacting,
vividly responding the sensual promise of the demon-to-be's touch, while her brain had
gone into non-functional mode, swamped with a debilitating combination of love and desire
driven by Willow's ever-growing demonic pheremones.</p>

<p>A soft, husky laugh greeted her name. &quot;Such a beautiful
Slayer...<i>my </i>beautiful Slayer...&quot; the succubus-to-be whispered, and suddenly
Buffy found herself borne backwards by hard muscled hands. Her shoulders hit a wall,
pressed there by ripe curves that were somehow completely familiar and unfamiliar at the
same time, her feet completely off the ground as powerful hands molded to her hips. In an
instant those sensual lips found her own, propelled by their sensual momentum. Where her
movements were fast and powerful, the demon-to-be-Willow's kiss was amazingly soft, full
of a slow burn kind of eroticism that made Buffy's blood boil and threaten to turn to
nothing but steam. She whimpered softly into Willow's mouth, intensely aware of the
feverish need that suddenly flared through every nerve ending. Unable to resist the
powerful temptation, Buffy's lips parted, instinctively inviting Willow to deepen the kiss
as her hips met a sharp grinding thrust with equal passion. The Slayer lifted an arm,
wrapping it tightly around a muscular neck and shoulders, lost in the need to pull her
even closer as she slid her free hand over full curves, then up over Willow's face,
brailing her altered features. It was still Willow, but somehow different, and then her
fingers encountered the delicate beginnings of horns and she explored them with a gossamer
touch, glorying in the answering groan from her inhuman lover. Suddenly, her head rocked
back on her shoulders, a dull scream welling up from her throat. She heard Willow's
answering cry as her head slammed into the wall so hard she saw stars--or maybe it was the
orgasm ripping through her system.</p>

<p>Or maybe it was something else entirely, because for a moment, the
world gleamed brilliantly white, illuminating every inch of the narrow corridor in
sunlight before falling dark again.</p>

<p>Buffy's feet hit the ground, skidding in dust and grit and knocking
her into the body pressed against her own. If not for the wall at her back, she would have
collapsed entirely. Willow fell heavily into her, and the Slayer could only hold on. If
they were going to become demons, at least they would be together.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy?&quot; It was Willow's voice, but uncertain and smaller
now as it vibrated near her shoulder. &quot;Wha...wha's go'n on?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will,&quot; the Slayer breathed as the details began sinking
in to her fogged brain. It was Willow, her Willow. The one that was only a little above
her own height, with a sweet voice, and soft curves, and no glow-in-the-dark parts.</p>

<p>&quot;Y'know, this sort of thing never happened in the middle
ages,&quot; Melvin's wry, booming voice broke into the Slayer's dazed thoughts.
&quot;People were much more predictable then,&quot; he complained. &quot;The men were men,
the women were chattel and the goats...well, mostly they were nervous, since they were
chattel too...it wasn't easy being chattel in those days.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy ignored him, instead running her fingers through silky hair,
relieved to find that Willow's features had softened to their normal dimensions and her
forehead bore no trace of horns. Buffy's knees buckled then, and she slid down until she
was sitting on the floor, Willow cradled in her arms.</p>

<p>&quot;I don' feel so good,&quot; the hacker moaned weakly against
Buffy's shoulder, while the Slayer tenderly petted silky hair.</p>

<p>&quot;That makes two of us,&quot; Buffy rasped. The last 24 hours
had been a helluva a ride.</p>

<p>&quot;Funny,&quot; Melvin broke in. &quot;I'd think you two would be
feeling mighty fine...spell's broken by the way,&quot; he added needlessly. &quot;And in
style...that's the first time I've ever seen it happen quite
that...dramatically...actually, that's the first time I've seen it at all. This whole
bein' in love thing seems to have altered my ambitions. Once upon a time, I'd have had two
for the price of one.&quot; Uneven lips lifted in a wry smile as he focused on Buffy.
&quot;So, is this why you weren't sure about...uh...things?&quot;</p>

<p>The Slayer shrugged in the dark, trying not to envision the merrily
leering expression doubtless twisting the creature's uneven features. &quot;Well, you can
understand why it might make the...situation...a bit more...well...uncertain...I mean it's
not quite so...definitive.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a brief pause and then the incubus commented, &quot;Well,
I've always heard that--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Buffy...what happened?&quot; Willow groaned, interrupting
before he could get any farther. Dazed and confused about what had happened, she didn't
understand any of the conversation she was hearing.</p>

<p>&quot;A little bit of trouble,&quot; Buffy said without elaborating,
as she turned her attention back to her friend. Pointedly ignoring the demon's running
commentary, she ran gentle fingers over Willow's curves, reassuring herself that they were
indeed back to their normal dimensions. &quot;You're okay,&quot; she whispered thankfully,
finally content that Willow was indeed Willow.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course 'm okay,&quot; Willow mumbled.</p>

<p>&quot;Think you're okay enough to get up?&quot; the Slayer
questioned as she slipped an arm around her friend's waist. &quot;I'll help.&quot;</p>

<p>The hacker nodded. &quot;Think so,&quot; she breathed.</p>

<p>Muscles pulling taut with the effort required, Buffy and somehow
managed to find the strength to push to her feet, pulling Willow along with her, though
after all she'd been through, even the Slayer was unsteady. &quot;So was that
really...&quot; she didn't finish the sentence, but the question was obvious.</p>

<p>&quot;True Love's Kiss...I'd think that would be obvious,
Slayer,&quot; the demon chuckled. &quot;Though I'll admit, I didn't realize it also meant
True Love's Orgasm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;True Love's...&quot; Buffy exhaled as though struck and
tightened her hold on Willow's slender frame as his meaning sank in. Not Oz. Willow's true
love wasn't Oz. It was her. Buffy didn't know whether to shout for joy or find a hole and
hide in it out of sheer terror. This wasn't just late night experimentation anymore. This
was more responsibility than she was feeling ready for. Being in love with a vampire who
could take care of himself and was already on the darker side of life was one thing. Her
all too human best friend was quite another.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy,&quot; Willow questioned uncertainly as she lifted her
head from the support of the Slayer's shoulder, &quot;am I dreaming, or was I kissing you?
Because I think I did, but then again, I'm not sure...cos...somehow...it's like I was a
lot taller and bigger...than I really am...and I don't get that...&quot; She shook her
head as though that might help resettle her scrambled grey matter.</p>

<p>&quot;Just hold on...we'll get out of here.&quot; And maybe then
figure out what was going on.</p>

<p>&quot;I DON'T THINK SO!!!&quot; A deep voice boomed off the walls,
and bits of concrete powdered down on their heads. &quot;MELVINATHORAXISTHULIXIS!!!&quot;
The Enforcer demon stood at the end of the corridor, its fractured black flesh glowing
faintly even in the absolute darkness of the corridor.</p>

<p>Buffy's mouth went dry and she hauled Willow's arm across her
shoulder, supporting most of her weight. &quot;Run!!&quot; Melvin ordered as he grabbed
her arm and shoved both of them through the hole he'd made in the wall. A moment later, he
followed behind them. The hole had been more than big enough for the two girls, but not
the demon and his horns ripped through solid concrete as he muscled his way into the
caverns. &quot;Keep moving,&quot; he ordered the girls as the demon behind them crashed
through the narrow corridor.</p>

<p>Even larger than Melvin, the Enforcer demon could barely moved
through the hallway and its broad shoulders and misshapen horns tore chunks from concrete
and plaster. &quot;MELVINATHORAXISTHULIXIS!!!&quot; the creature roared furiously.
&quot;YOU WON'T ESCAPE ME!!!! I'LL TEAR OFF YOUR HEAD AND SHOVE IT DOWN YOUR
THROAT!!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A charming bunch, those Enforcer demons,&quot; the incubus
grunted as he twisted to get through a section of the tunnel that both Willow and Buffy
had passed through with room to spare.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I can tell,&quot; Buffy panted as she blindly felt ahead
of herself, to follow the corridor, hoping the floor wouldn't drop out from under her
feet. &quot;What do we do if we hit a dead end?&quot; she questioned worriedly.</p>

<p>Profanities rocked the walls behind them, as deep booming thuds
rattled the earth.</p>

<p>&quot;Then the end won't be the only thing that's dead,&quot; Melvin
panted.</p>

<p>&quot;I was afraid you'd say that,&quot; Buffy admitted.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * * *</p>

<p>Angel could barely contain his desire to do something other than
pace helplessly back and forth. He glanced at his watch again, but didn't need to.
Midnight was a special time for all demons, a magic time when the world was in balance. He
didn't need to see a watch to know how close it was. He could feel it in his bones. Behind
him, Giles was preparing the materials for the ceremony to send the demon back to hell,
his manner calm and unruffled, though Angel was quite certain it was nothing but an act.
He whipped around suddenly, his black duster flowing around long legs. &quot;I'm going
after them,&quot; he said simply.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; Rupert Giles disagreed without looking up.
&quot;You're not. I need you here.&quot;</p>

<p>Angel's lips drew back from his clenched teeth in a frustrated
snarl. &quot;And Buffy may need me down there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll be more help to her up here,&quot; Giles clipped, still
without looking up.</p>

<p>Angel winced. &quot;Helping you kill Willow,&quot; he growled
unhappily.</p>

<p>And then Giles' head did lift, rage glittering in his eyes. &quot;If
you think I like this...&quot; he hissed tightly.</p>

<p>Angel's answer was equally stressed and acid. &quot;Well, it does
solve the Council's little problem.&quot;</p>

<p>For a moment, Rupert Giles was once again the out-of-control
teenager who'd been nicknamed &quot;The Ripper&quot; while wandering the streets of
London. He almost lunged, but got it under control. &quot;If you think that has anything
to do with this, you're sorely mistaken.&quot; He swallowed hard. &quot;I'd do anything I
could to save Willow, but we have to make certain that creature isn't released on the
world.&quot;</p>

<p>The two men stood glaring at one another, their tempers on edge,
both wanting to fight something, but with no targets other than each other. Finally, Angel
stuffed his hands in his pockets and spun away as he silently prayed to a God he couldn't
believe cared about his cursed soul to keep both girls safe. They were both so young and
Buffy had already lost more than any human should. He would do anything to spare her more
pain.</p>

<p>Giles stared at the other man's stiff back, his own emotions raw.
Both girls were like the children he never expected to have. He'd have died for either of
them. &quot;We can only pray that Buffy has succeeded in getting her out...and
that...we've chosen the right ceremony.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right,&quot; Angel exhaled heavily. &quot;Pray...&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * * *</p>

<p>Dead end.</p>

<p>It was just that simple.</p>

<p>They had hit a dead end.</p>

<p>Buffy cursed softly, while Willow leaned heavily against a rough
stone wall, steadier than she had been, but still shaky.</p>

<p>&quot;It's too hard,&quot; Melvinathoraxisthulixis muttered
disgustedly as he tested the rock with a thick fingernail. &quot;I can't break
through.&quot;</p>

<p>Behind them, the echoey bellows of the Enforcer demon continued to
rattle the earth around them, though they were heavily muffled by the thick rocks.</p>

<p>&quot;I was so damn sure it would take us into one of the caverns
that leads to the surface,&quot; the demon growled. &quot;I mean this whole town is
sitting on top of a giant network of caves, and we manage to find the only one that
doesn't go anywhere.&quot;</p>

<p>The roaring was drawing closer.</p>

<p>&quot;But it does go somewhere. In fact, it goes all the way to the
surface&quot; Willow murmured. &quot;I can smell fresh air.&quot; She didn't add how good
it felt to breathe a hint of oxygen not tainted by the demonic stench that surrounded
Melvin and his pursuer.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; Melvin muttered. As the only one who could
see in the dark, he could make out the details the Slayer and her friend missed.
&quot;There's a crack there...but it's way too narrow even for you two.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow closed her eyes, tipping her head back on her shoulders, as
she felt the faint breeze caress her face. She tried to imagine the tons of rock, trees,
and grass that lay above their heads. All natural, all earthen. She could feel them. She
swallowed hard. &quot;There may be a way out of here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Talk to me,&quot; Buffy whispered intensely.</p>

<p>&quot;It's all about emotional control...just like the pencil.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a long moment of silence as the Slayer absorbed what
Willow was saying. &quot;Except the pencil doesn't weigh twenty tons,&quot; she hissed at
last. &quot;Not to mention the fact that you can only do that pencil thing about half the
time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I've been getting better,&quot; Willow insisted. &quot;I
can do it...I can get us out of here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, wait a minute,&quot; Melvin broke in. &quot;I'm not
following this. Are you trying to say you can break through the rocks?&quot;</p>

<p>Willow nodded in the darkness. &quot;I can use the opening as a
wedge...push the rocks outward from it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're what...a hundred and fifteen soaking wet? Not exactly a
musclebound maniac there,&quot; Melvin muttered in disbelief. &quot;I don't think so,
honey. I mean it's sweet of you too--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Magic,&quot; Willow interrupted. &quot;I can do it with magic.
I'm a witch.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; the incubus breathed, then added, &quot;That
explains a lot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like?&quot; Buffy prompted.</p>

<p>&quot;Her vision problems...I did notice them, y'know,&quot; he told
Willow. &quot;Since her...er...best bud's the Slayer, I figured she'd just absorbed a
little of the ambient mystical energy that hangs around folks like you and it was
affecting our bonding. But if she's a witch....&quot; He shook his head in the darkness.
&quot;Sheez, even Spike ought to know that mystical pheromones affect them differently
from normal mortals. She probably wouldn't have even worked for getting the staff
anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>It was Buffy's turn to simply exhale, &quot;Oh.&quot; She still
hadn't decided how she felt about their latest ally. After all, he was helping them to
survive, but on the other hand, he'd fully intended to seduce Willow and that wasn't the
sort of thing the Slayer was inclined to forgive.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I'm just glad we don't have to find out,&quot; Willow
inserted, then added, &quot;No insult intended.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;None taken.&quot;</p>

<p>Another roar rattled the walls in the distance, reminding them of
exactly what was chasing them.</p>

<p>&quot;So what happens if you can't do it?&quot; Melvin asked at
last.</p>

<p>Willow shrugged. &quot;Since we're going to die anyway, does it
really matter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fair point...not one I really wanted to consider, but
fair,&quot; he allowed.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you need from us?&quot; Buffy asked, ignoring him in
favor her friend.</p>

<p>Willow was already focusing on centering her emotions. She was far
less confident than she had tried to sound. After all, while she'd gotten pretty good at
hurling pencils, and had even managed to pick up and spin small rocks and such, but this
was way past anything she'd ever tried. Way past anything she'd ever even expected to try.
&quot;Just be quiet and ready to move once I start,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Oh, and one
more thing...&quot; And Willow looked down even though she couldn't see, trying to imagine
Buffy's face in front of her as she murmured, &quot;You never did answer my question. Did
I dream that, or did I really kiss you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We kissed,&quot; Buffy said without elaborating. Gentle
fingers found her lips in the darkness, outlining them with instinctive knowledge, and
then Willow's lips found her own and she thought she tasted tears. In the background,
their pursuer was getting closer by the minute, apparently tearing his way through solid
rock in his desperation to get to them.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, true love rules,&quot; Melvin broke into the kiss as he
yanked Buffy back. &quot;But really pointless if we're all in a million pieces.&quot; His
hands were tight on the Slayer. &quot;If you're gonna do this, go for it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can do it, Wicca-Girl,&quot; Buffy encouraged.</p>

<p>Willow pulled inside herself, lips moving in soft chants that helped
her concentrate her mental energies. She knew the trick, knew it was just a matter of
tapping into the natural flow of energy and directing it. Exactly the same principle as
the pencil, and the rocks overhead had more touch with the earth, more energy to tap. It
was just a matter of overcoming her mental image of how large and heavy and impossible to
move they were. She had to believe.</p>
<i>

<p>&quot;There is no try, only do.&quot;</p>
</i>

<p>Okay, so old Star Wars lines probably weren't the best focusing
exercise in the world, but somehow, the thought of Yoda's voice helped. She exhaled, felt
the energy inside her own body, touched it, tapped it, then unleashed it. The chanting
grew louder as she reached out, mentally searching the rocks, tracing the crack that ran
between them, opening herself to their raw power, their link to the universe.</p>
<i>

<p>&quot;Feel the Force, Willow.&quot;</p>
</i>

<p>Her lips were moving too fast to speak intelligible words now.
Muscles rippled just under the skin. She could feel the Enforcer demon--a darkness within
the natural world--drawing nearer, tearing at rocks and cement to get to them, but it
didn't throw her concentration as she felt the earth start to move. She could feel Buffy,
her fear, her love, her caring. They gave her strength as she kept pushing. A few tiny
rocks trickled down on her head, but she didn't feel them. Her hands lifted, fingers
pressing together as she envisioned her mind and power doing the same thing to the world
above them. She didn't see the gleam that started at her braced fingertips, she was too
deep in her own efforts.</p>

<p>More dirt and rocks rained down on her head as she slowly lifted her
hands, mentally imagining that she was pushing the earth away.</p>

<p>Power, raw and very real pulsed through the young woman, wielded
with more skill than she should have possessed.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * * *</p>

<p>&quot;Giles, do you feel something?&quot; Angel questioned as he
felt the earth tremble beneath his feet.</p>

<p>The librarian shook his head distractedly. &quot;It's a four pointer
at most,&quot; he murmured. He'd been in California long enough that tiny earthquakes no
longer affected him. &quot;Now I need your help if we're going to send
Melvinathoraxisthulixis back to hell where he belongs.&quot;</p>

<p>Angel crouched down, holding a hand above the ground. &quot;I really
don't think this is an earthquake,&quot; he whispered, other worldly bells and whistles
going off in his head. &quot;It's something else.&quot; He straightened slowly and was
about to rise when something tackled into him from the side.</p>

<p>&quot;You were going to send Melvin back to hell!&quot;
Stelladvoratrellundar bellowed furiously as she began beating on his head and shoulders.</p>

<p>The vampire and infuriated demon tumbled off to the side together,
rolling in the dirt like tussling children as Angel fought in vain just to keep her from
hitting him.</p>

<p>&quot;Just like a vampire!&quot; the succubus' voice rose above the
fray in piercing shrieks. &quot;Not to keep his word!&quot;</p>

<p>Giles could only stare at the fight with a look akin to horror,
uncertain how to react. The clock was ticking down. The ceremony was the most important
thing, but at the same time, there wasn't much hope of getting through it while Angel was
rolling around on the ground with a bloody succubus. He grabbed a crossbow from the stack
of weapons off to one side, trying to take aim on the rolling, tumbling pair.</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; Angel yelped when he caught site of the weapon in
Giles' hands out of the corner of his eye and between blows. Rupert Giles' aim wasn't
anything to write home about past about four feet. And generally, it was best if his
targets weren't moving. A shot through the heart was the only thing that would be fatal,
but any other hits on his body would hurt--a massive fist collided with his jaw--at least
as much as getting beat on, probably more. All rules about not hitting women aside, he
tried punching her several times, nearly shattering his knuckles in the process, and as
far as he could tell achieving absolutely nothing. It was not proving to be his day.
&quot;Look,&quot; he tried to reason with the howling succubus. &quot;It's not what you
think--&quot; A fist collided with his jaw and he barely managed to twist in time to avoid
getting a knee in a very sensitive portion of his anatomy. &quot;We're trying to--&quot;
Another fist.</p>

<p>It was definitely not Angel's night.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</p>

<p>Buffy's eyes rounded as she watched the light that had started at
Willow's fingertips expand outward, spreading over her body before it threaded upward into
the nooks and crannies of the rocks overhead. The hair on the back of her neck stood on
end as she felt the electricity that arced through the surrounding earth. And through it
all, her friend's lips moved steadily faster, while her eyes were closed, her expression
perfectly composed as the lights flickered over her. Dirt and small rocks flittered
downward and the ground trembled ever so slightly.</p>

<p>And then the real fun started.</p>

<p>Willow's voice rose to an almost steady whine of chanting, her head
snapping back on her shoulders as the rocks suddenly started to move. And then she was
screaming, lifting her hands as though pushing at something, her face twisted with effort,
her voice that of someone in pain. Buffy would have gone to her, but hard hands grabbed
her back.</p>

<p>And then rocks geysered upward in a fountain of earth and stone,
splitting, cracking, lifting, and tumbling over each other as if trying to escape the
energy shooting from the young woman's fingertips.</p>

<p>It lasted no more than a minute, but in that time, Buffy Summers
suddenly gained a whole new respect for Willow's belief in all things pagan. The last
thing she saw before the lights blinked out was the neatly rounded tube to the surface had
been carved in the earth. The world fell silent except for the soft grunt and thud as
Willow toppled to her knees. Blinking to clear her fried irises, Buffy lunged toward where
she had last seen her friend. She touched warm skin as she fell to her knees beside the
witch's slender frame and wrapped an arm around Willow's shoulder to find her trembling
violently. &quot;You okay, Wicca-Girl?&quot; she exhaled worriedly.</p>

<p>A tiny whimper greeted the question, then Willow straightened her
shoulders under Buffy's arm. &quot;That's a little harder than it looks,&quot; she exhaled
heavily.</p>

<p>&quot;Umm...yeah...&quot; Buffy whispered, not knowing what else to
say. Her eyes were already readjusting to the thin moonlight that now spilled into the
tunnel from overhead, allowing her to see her friend's exhausted posture. She twisted to
stare back at the creature that had unwittingly become their ally. He was still staring up
at the hole Willow had just carved in the ceiling, his massive jaw hanging open.</p>

<p>&quot;That ain't normal,&quot; Melvin breathed at last.</p>

<p>&quot;You're a fine one to talk,&quot; the Slayer riposted neatly.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm eccentric,&quot; Melvin disagreed mildly, his attention
still on the hole over their heads. &quot;That's just weird...so, how do we get out of
here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Climb?&quot; Willow said weakly.</p>
