<!-- Whither Thou Goest \ Chapter Twelve -->

<P>Buffy was amazed she managed to remain upright as she pulled the door shut behind her. She was trembling like a leaf in a high wind and wanted nothing more than to go back inside and sink into Willow's hold. Despite the fears that had plagued her after their lovemaking, she felt safe with Willow, whole, like a part of something larger than herself.</P>
<P>Silently chastising herself, she consciously straightened her spine, reminding herself of what she'd learned about her enemy. It was for the best, necessary even, if she was going to keep her loved ones safe.</P>
<P>She was still standing there a moment later, when she became aware that someone had come up behind her, and was clearing her throat softly--well, actually, not that softly, since she managed to make herself heard over the music blaring out of Buffy's room. The Slayer turned to look back over her shoulder, and found herself being studied by a pair of intelligent dark eyes. She tensed, noting shoulder length blond hair. Had DuCourvallier decided to bring the fight to her? The newcomer was pretty in a sort of girl next door way, but her clothes reeked of someone trying desperately not to be noticed and her manner was painfully shy, her gaze sliding away the moment Buffy's made contact. She hardly fit the role of the deadly killer demon. Then again, the Slayer had seen stranger things. And certainly the vampire had fooled her mother into thinking she was just an average coed.</P>
<P>Buffy's gaze became pointed, noting the steady movement of the girl's chest--respiration--the fluttery pulse at her throat--a heartbeat--and the thin sheen of moisture that dampened her skin--sweat. No vampire then. &quot;May I help you?&quot; she questioned cautiously, still uncertain who or what she was dealing with.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm...uh...I'm sorry, I was ...um...I was looking for Willow Rosenberg's room...&quot; the girl said haltingly, then seemed to lose control over her speech center as she babbled onward in explanation under the Slayer's silent scrutiny. &quot;I...we...uh...met...a couple of weeks ago...at a Wiccan gathering...I-I just heard about the robbery...at the Twenty-Four/Seven. I wanted to know...to know if-if she's okay....&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy relaxed a fraction. A friend of Willow's--she hunted her memory, trying to pull up anyone the hacker might have mentioned. &quot;I'm her roommate...Buffy Summers....&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You're the girl who was there with her,&quot; the wiccan said in a rush, and Buffy nodded</P>
<P>&quot;Tara,&quot; the girl supplied as if she sensed the Slayer was searching her memory for the information.</P>
<P>Buffy blinked as she remembered Willow mentioning a girl named Tara that she'd met at the Wiccan gathering. She'd liked the girl, commenting on how sweet she'd been, and remarking on her shyness too, leaving Buffy with the feeling she was reminded of herself. &quot;Right,&quot; she said. &quot;She mentioned you... said you're nice...&quot;</P>
<P>For a moment, Buffy thought Tara was going to combust she glowed so brightly at that brief bit of praise. <I>Crushing and crushing bad</I>, the Slayer diagnosed in an instant. She felt a brief flicker of jealousy as she wondered if Willow had noticed. &quot; Don't worry,&quot; she assured the young woman. &quot;She's okay...just a little shook up...she's...uh...spending a few days at her parents....&quot; Buffy hoped Tara didn't know Willow too well, or she'd pick up on that little lie, since the chances of Will going home for tea and sympathy were slightly less than nonexistent.</P>
<P>But Tara only nodded after a moment. &quot;I...uh...guess that makes sense...she must have been pretty scared.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Buffy flinched as she remembered the experience. She still hadn't had a chance to process it all. Just shoved it away in a mental closet with everything else she'd never had time to process. One day that closet was probably just going to explode and it wasn't likely to be a pretty sight. &quot;Scared...&quot; she exhaled, staring blankly into the distance. The room behind her was still pulsing with bad music, the screaming lead punker covering Willow's yelling, while stereos and boom boxes were being turned up, up and down the corridor. By morning, Buffy figured absently, there probably wouldn't be a member of Stevenson left with any hearing. That was assuming the walls were still standing.</P>
<P>Tara looked meaningfully at the door, her expression questioning. &quot;I...uh...I think you left your stereo on,&quot; she observed after a beat, sensing the strangeness in Buffy's mood.</P>
<P>The Slayer glanced back as she shook free of her silent musings. &quot;Um...yeah...it's...um...for the fish...Willow's fish...&quot; <I>Oh boy, that's lame</I>, she chided herself silently, but having started the lie, she was stuck with it, no matter how high Tara's brows climbed on her forehead. &quot;They like the music.&quot; <I>Really, seriously lame</I>. <I>Get out now, before you shove your foot any farther down your throat</I>. &quot;Ahm, look, I kind of promised my mom I'd drop by...she's pretty shaken about the whole robbery thing.&quot; That last part at least made sense. Most people's mother's would be massively upset if their child was caught in the middle of an armed robbery, not consider it a slow night.</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah...I guess I can understand that...&quot; Tara said hesitantly, pausing for a long moment before continuing, &quot;I-if you see Willow...would you tell her I'm glad she's okay?&quot; Again the young woman's eyes fell away, her skin flushing with all the signs of embarrassment.</P>
<I>
<P>Oh boy, she has it bad</I>. It startled Buffy to realize she couldn't even dislike the other woman. There was something entirely too shy and gentle about her to bear her any malice, especially since Buffy was pretty sure Willow didn't return the emotions. &quot;I'll tell her,&quot; she assured Tara. At least, she would if she was still alive. &quot;Like I said, I really do have to go,&quot; she added after a beat.</P>
<P>Tara nodded, looking up at Buffy with eyes that seemed far too old for her years. &quot;Okay...thanks....&quot; She squinted ever so slightly, the expression giving the Slayer the strangest feeling she was being stared through rather than at. &quot;Be careful,&quot; She added after a beat.</P>
<P>Buffy nodded, her voice oddly choked as she responded, &quot;Thanks.&quot; She turned away to leave, even took a few steps, only to turn back. For reasons she couldn't completely fathom, she wasn't surprised to find that Tara hadn't moved an inch. She didn't even know what she was going to say before the words left her mouth. &quot;Look...Willow's fish...they need to be fed...in the morning. That's when she always feeds them...in the morning....&quot; It was obviously Buffy's turn to babble, but then she wasn't thinking very clearly . &quot;I was going to come back and do it...but since you're here....&quot; Buffy offered a small shrug, trying to make light of the whole thing, so it didn't seem like it was that important. &quot;I was wondering if you would mind?&quot; She could see the hunger to please burning in the other girl's eyes. Well, she was a better choice for letting Willow out of the handcuffs than Todd, the floor RA--she didn't look like she'd enjoy it nearly as much as Todd would, which was fine by Buffy--and since Buffy didn't dare call one of the Scoobies--they would know something was up--Tara seemed like a logical choice. And she had gentle eyes. It wasn't just what Buffy was sure was a crush on Willow. There was something about her that seemed so caring. &quot;Y'know, stopping by and feeding Willow's fish...in the morning.&quot;</P>
<P>Her brows knitted in a puzzled frown, Tara nodded. &quot;Sure...I can stop by...to feed her fish...it's no problem.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy fished into her pocket for her dorm key and handed it over to Tara, hoping the girl hadn't noticed that her fingers were trembling ever so slightly. &quot;Thanks...I appreciate it.&quot; Tara was still staring at Buffy in a way that made the Slayer wonder if the other girl knew something about what was coming. If she did, she didn't mention it though, just took the key and tucked it in her wallet. &quot;See ya around.&quot; Buffy turned away, hurrying down the hallway, the feeling of Tara's eyes on her back, an almost palpable sensation. Strangely enough, she never doubted that she'd made the right decision, and she didn't even know why.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</P>
<P>She shoved quarters into the phone, then dialed the number from memory, waiting impatiently while it rang. Four rings, five rings, six rings. Eight rings. Ten rings.</P>
<P>Still nothing.</P>
<P>She slammed the handset down, hooking her arm over the payphone as she leaned deeper into the booth, momentarily escaping the sounds of traffic and humans moving ignorantly through the night. Too little, too late. She leaned her forehead against the cool surface of the phone, absently noting the graffiti scratched into the coinbox as she tried to remember if she was sane pretending to be crazy or the crazy pretending to sane. At times like this, it all seemed to meld together. Moments later, she straightened and moved on, moving through the dark streets; one more unnoticed wraith in a city full of them. She glanced at the watch residing on her inner wrist. Not so many hours left to go now. She couldn't help but wonder at the sanity of giving the Slayer a warning and time to prepare. Now there was a bad--possibly fatal--choice if ever there was one. She was still considering her own stupidity when the voice reached her, ancient and insinuating. The kind that could not be resisted, no matter how thoroughly common sense dictated walking away.</P>
<P>&quot;Learn what is to come.&quot; The accent was heavy and, with the distinct dropped syllables and almost nonexistent R's of someone whose native language was Mandarin Chinese.</P>
<P>Delaine slowly pivoted to face the old woman, dressed like something out of a bad movie, the high necked silk sheath dress bright with twisting figures of hand-embroidered silk dragons and phoenixes, but she knew enough to recognize the real thing behind the costume designed to appeal to ignorant tourists. The woman was ancient, her white hair caught back from a wrinkled and lined face, her figure no longer filling out the curves sewn into the dress, leaving it to pillow out in odd ways. Jewelry hung in thick strands from her neck, and every finger glittered with jewels, all of them costume, except the one ring. She recognized the broad gold band with a simple opal. A scrying stone, a way of seeing into other times and places. Green eyes lifted and clashed with black, then she felt the woman's dark power as something reached out and gripped her tightly.</P>
<P>&quot;To understand the past is to know the future,&quot; the old woman continued without missing a beat. &quot;Nothing in life or death is accidental.&quot; A wizened hand slid through the air and the vampire nearly collapsed as a bolt of agony fired through her chest. &quot;Everything lies within the realm of the <I>Book of Changes</I>.&quot;</P>
<P>She tried to back away, shivering as though she was still capable of feeling the cold. &quot;I have no money to pay you,&quot; she nearly choked on the words. A hand landed on her arm, guiding her toward the narrow door that led into the woman's tiny shop where it resided between store fronts, barely wider than most alleyways.</P>
<P>&quot;There are many terms of barter...as you well know...&quot; the fortune teller whispered.</P>
<P>Strings of beads rattled against each other as they were pushed aside. Delaine didn't mean to step through the hanging barrier, didn't intend to...and yet...there she was, standing in the dully lit shop, the patterns of the <I>I-Ching</I> lying before her, the lines of the trigrams sketched in charcoal on the floor, while the musky smell of yarrow stalks filled the air alongside the cloying scent of sandalwood. She tried to pull back, but couldn't move as she stared at the patterns of the ancient Chinese method of divination.</P>
<I>
<P>&quot;You know the I-Ching,&quot;</I> the old woman was speaking Mandarin now, the lyric musicality of the language perversely threatening.</P>
<P>Delaine--already she had succumbed to the temptation to think of herself by her birth name once again--folded her arms around her midsection, trying again to back away, but the old woman's hand on her arm was implacable. &quot;Don't,&quot; she croaked, her voice dry and ragged. &quot;You don't know....&quot;</P>
<P>But the Chinese woman's voice was as obdurate as her grip. &quot;It has the power to see the future...and also to create it...as you were created....&quot; She waved her free hand and powder so fine it was like smoke filled the air in front of the vampire as verbal images of her fate were laid out before her.</P>
<I>
<P>&quot;The Judgement...If the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead...he goes astray...follows...finds guidance...favorable to find friends in the west and south...forego friends in the east and north....&quot;</P>
</I>
<P>Delaine collapsed to her knees, barely aware of the door that slammed in the old woman's wake. She was cold, so damn cold she could barely keep her teeth from chattering. The words slid over her, sentences and phrases running together as the old woman knitted her past and future together, stitching power the way a seamstress had stitched her dress, mere snippets slipping through to her conscious mind.</P>
<I>
<P>&quot;The Image... thunder within the earth...the Turning Point...kings of antiquity closed the passes... at solstice...Merchants and strangers did not go about...ruler...not travel through the provinces.&quot;</P>
</I>
<P>She was limp and unresisting as a withered hand dug into blond hair pulling her head back, forcing her to face fathomless black eyes as the old woman continued reading off a destiny that she could barely even comprehend.</P>
<I>
<P>&quot;The Lines: Change at the beginning means: Return from a great distance. No need for remorse.&quot;</P>
</I>
<P>And then she was released, falling forward to her hands, gasping for air though she no longer needed to breathe.</P>
<I>
<P>&quot;Change in the second place means: Straight, square, great. Without purpose, Yet nothing remains unfurthered.&quot;</P>
</I>
<P>Somehow, she focused, concentrated on hearing the words, knowing she needed them, running on instinct to simply survive.</P>
<I>
<P>&quot;Change in the third place means: Hidden lines. One is able to remain persevering. If by chance you are in the service of a king. Seek not works, but bring to completion.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Change in the fourth place means: Walking in the midst of others, One returns alone.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Change in the fifth place means: Noblehearted return. No remorse.&quot;</P>
</I>
<P>She folded into herself, trying to ignore the voices hammering in her head as the prediction drew to a close while a gentle hand continued tenderly petting her hair back from her brow.</P>
<I>
<P>&quot;Change at the top means: Missing the return. Misfortune. Misfortune from within and without. If armies are set marching in this way. One will in the end suffer a great defeat. Disastrous for the ruler of the country. For ten years, it will not be possible to attack again.&quot;</P>
</I>
<P>&quot;No...&quot; she hissed through clenched teeth, the words equal parts anger and torment. The thing inside her body roared, furious at the power being wielded against it, sweet features morphing to show its face to the world.</P>
<P>&quot;The game goes on...and on...&quot; her tormentor whispered, gesturing loosely with one hand, filling the air with more pale smokey powder. &quot;You are what you are,&quot; that too-wise voice reminded her implacably. &quot;And power suits, online stock trading, and rental cars do not change that.&quot; She gripped silky blond hair with an amazingly strong hand, wrenching Delaine's head back with more ease than should have been possible now that the thing inside her was raging and screaming. &quot;You cannot run from destiny, just as you cannot hide from it or bargain with it. <I>It is what you are</I>.&quot; A finger trailed lightly along her cheek, the overlong pointed red nail just scratching the flesh and trailing humanity in its wake as she morphed back to her mortal form. &quot;Destiny burns in you...<I>you cannot escape it</I>...&quot;</P>
<P>The vampire twisted her head, trying to see into the old woman's black eyes, only to find herself staring at a young and unlined face, the dark hair and blue eyes framing features that had been soft and loving in the past, but now were hard and cold. When the blade was pressed against her throat, it was almost a relief. &quot;Because if you can't face reality, then maybe we <I>should </I>just go ahead and end it.&quot;</P>
<P>Then she felt the knife cut deep, slicing through muscle, flesh, bone, veins and arteries even as she pitched forward, the last gasp of air from dead lungs whistling past her lips in barely audible syllables. &quot;Elizabeth.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</P>
<P>Rupert Giles was very much aware of just how dark it was outside, the fact that no one was answering Buffy's phone, and, of course, that a day's efforts had yielded exactly nothing. He knew no more about where Delaine DuCourvallier might be, or what she might be up to than he had when he started.</P>
<P>And now he couldn't help but think of Buffy's voice when she'd told him she was going on patrol. It had been too nonchalant, too controlled, much too unBuffylike.... And she'd asked him to say hi to her mother...which made no sense whatsoever...unless....</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, God,&quot; he exhaled as the realization struck him with the force of an actual blow. &quot;She knows...she knows where DuCourvallier is...and she's going to face her alone.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Did you say something G-man?&quot; Xander inquired as he looked up from the corner of the painting he was studying, his tone surprisingly bouncy. The doctor had given him a couple of muscle relaxants for use if he got too sore from the beating, and he'd given in and taken one upon waking from his little nap. He was definitely feeling good...really good. A little unsteady maybe, but good.</P>
<P>Giles flung his pen down, ignoring Xander as he swore angrily, &quot;Bloody hell, somehow Buffy found out where DuCourvallier is going to be. She's gone to meet her.&quot;</P>
<P>Xander paled, while Joyce, Anya, and a videotape-watching Spike all looked toward the former Watcher.</P>
<P>The blond vampire was the first to speak, asking quite cheerfully as he looked up from the blood soaked microwave popcorn he was enjoying with his soap opera, &quot;So, what's up, mate?&quot;</P>
<P>Giles' eyes fell on the vampire, he saw the look of laughing triumph and knew. &quot;You did it,&quot; he hissed. He advanced on Spike, while the others looked on in confusion. &quot;You're the bloody messenger she used, aren't you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't know what you're talking about,&quot; the vampire insisted with a none-too-believable look of innocence.</P>
<P>Giles grabbed Spike by the collar hauling him to his feet. &quot;Where?&quot; he snarled, lips drawn back from tightly clenched teeth.</P>
<P>It was Xander who drew close to the two first. &quot;Um...Giles, maybe a note of explanation--however brief--is in order.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Spike yelped, playing for time. &quot;Since I don't know what you're talking about.&quot;</P>
<P>Giles was dangerously close to murder, but he reigned in his raging temper to force out an answer, &quot;I believe Buffy's gone to meet Delaine DuCourvallier, with the intention of fighting her--&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Four-hundred-year-old killer Vampire-Slayer chick,&quot; Xander repeated. &quot;Oh, that can't be good.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; Giles confirmed and shook Spike to drive his point home. &quot;Not good at all.&quot;</P>
<P>Joyce pushed to her feet, her expression horrified. &quot;No,&quot; she exhaled.</P>
<P>&quot;And since the only one here who had both the motive and the opportunity is Spike...&quot;</P>
<P>The blond vampire was grinning, his eyes dancing with good humor, despite, or perhaps because of Giles' obvious fury.</P>
<P>&quot;I have to conclude that this pissant, little bastard forwarded a message for the bitch.&quot; He shook Spike again to reinforce his point. &quot;Now, where are they meeting?&quot;</P>
<P>Spike appeared to consider the question, then suddenly his lips split into a grin and he laughed. &quot;Y'know, Giles, you take life much too seriously. They'll probably share a Slayer's bonding sort of moment.&quot;</P>
<P>Xander pushed his way between the two before Giles had a chance to grab for anything wooden. &quot;Whoa, Giles, no killing him...<I>yet</I>.&quot; Xander spun in place, grabbing Spike in Giles' place. &quot;Not until after he's told us where they are.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, come on, you two,&quot; Spike taunted them. &quot;We all know you're not going to kill me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, don't bet on that,&quot; Xander disagreed.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, come on, Boy Blunder, you know you won't do it. Not as long as I can't fight back.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But I will,&quot; Joyce said softly. All eyes swung to Buffy's mother where she stood only a few feet away, her expression deadly serious, a crossbow gripped tightly in her good hand. &quot;If anything happens to my daughter, you die. It's that simple.&quot;</P>
<P>Spike laughed, but there was an edge of nervousness to it this time. &quot;Now come on, Joyce,&quot; he coaxed, &quot;you and I are friends.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; Buffy's mother corrected him grimly as she rocked the crossbow into position, pulled the string back and looped it over the hammer, ignoring the throbbing agony that bolted through her broken wrist. &quot;We're not.&quot; She grabbed a crossbow bolt from the stack on the shelf where the weapon had been stored, dropped it into the slot, and took aim. &quot;And if you don't tell me where my daughter is, I'll aim higher next time.&quot; She triggered the crossbow and the bolt tore through Spike's thigh, drawing a dull scream of agony.</P>
<P>&quot;Ow! God, that hurts! Watch where you point that thing! You could have done some real damage!&quot; he exploded in outrage.</P>
<P>Much to everyone's surprise, even her own, Joyce yanked the bowstring back again and dropped another bolt into place. &quot;Guess where the next one's going to hit.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Now, Joyce, let's be reasonable,&quot; the vampire bargained nervously, while Xander and Giles backed out of range of the weapon.</P>
<P>She smiled a brittle smile. &quot;I've got a concussion, a broken wrist, plenty of drugs in my bloodstream, and a crossbow. Why be reasonable?&quot;</P>
<P>The vampire swallowed hard. He would have been sweating if he could still sweat. &quot;You wouldn't.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Try me,&quot; she challenged in return. &quot;I may not have Buffy's aim,&quot; she straightened her arm, sighting the weapon along the bolt, &quot;but I'm betting I'll hit something.&quot;</P>
<P>Xander and Giles both took another step back, while Anya popped a potato chip in her mouth, chewing absently as she watched the ongoing saga with the same sort of fascination she usually reserved for bad horror movies and new episodes of <I>Change of Heart</I>.</P>
<P>&quot;Now, wait--&quot; Spike was still arguing when Joyce triggered the crossbow a second time and the bolt sailed harmlessly between the vampire's knees, close enough to just brush his leather pants and leave him shaking.</P>
<P>&quot;Whoops,&quot; she sighed overdramatically. &quot;I missed.&quot; She yanked the string back a third time, then retrieved another bolt from the shelf where Giles stored them. &quot;Y'know, I think I see why Buffy likes this so much.&quot; Her eyes glinted wickedly. &quot;It's fun.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Go Buffy Mama,&quot; Xander muttered under his breath, while Spike's eyes widened another notch as he watched the woman reload the weapon.</P>
<P>&quot;Giles,&quot; he pleaded, sounding more than a little panicked, &quot;you aren't actually going to allow this?&quot; the vampire demanded in appalled outrage.</P>
<P>Giles' gaze remained locked on Buffy's mother as though he'd never quite seen her before as he answered rather distantly, &quot;Actually, I rather think I am.&quot;</P>
<P>Joyce made quite a show of closing one eye and aiming carefully as her hand wavered ever so slightly.</P>
<P>&quot;Xander!&quot; Spike shouted.</P>
<P>&quot;Did you hear something, Anya?&quot; the teen asked mock-innocently.</P>
<P>Not getting the joke, his former demon of a girlfriend responded seriously between bites, &quot;Yeah, I heard Spike crying out in terror because Buffy's mother is about to shoot his genitals off. It was pretty loud actually. If you couldn't hear it, you should probably get your hearing checked.&quot;</P>
<P>Every eye in the room fell on the former demon for a beat.</P>
<P>&quot;Umm, honey,&quot; Xander said at last, &quot;remind he to explain the concept of sarcasm again sometime.&quot;</P>
<P>Anya only shrugged.</P>
<P>&quot;Now, let's see what I can hit this time,&quot; Joyce mused out loud.</P>
<P>&quot;The school!&quot; Spike yelped, his voice rising a full octave as he saw her finger start to depress the trigger.</P>
<P>Joyce relaxed her hand fractionally. &quot;The school?&quot; she questioned, her tone politely demanding clarification. &quot;That leaves several choices.&quot;</P>
<P>Spike's mind was racing. If he told them where to find the Slayer and her predecessor, then he was dead either way because he'd lied to all involved and neither side was likely to be terribly thrilled with him if and when they found out. At least with this lot he had a chance of escaping before they could do any real damage. If either Slayer got involved, then he was dustbuster-fodder for sure. &quot;The high school,&quot; he insisted as though there was no other possible answer. &quot;You know, the one your daughter trashed during the act of graduating. There's not much of the place left as I understand it, but it's where DuCourvallier bloody well wanted to meet her.&quot;</P>
<P>Joyce straightened her arm, once again sighting the weapon, her expression coldly angry. &quot;Thank you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;She told me that if anyone else found out, she'd kill her. I did your bloody little Slayer-brat a favor by keeping her secret...and besides,<I> she also</I> threatened me if I told any of you. She was very clear about that. 'Tell them, Spike, and you're dead.' And since those camouflaged bastards made it so I can't even hit back--&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I think I should just shoot,&quot; Joyce decided out loud.</P>
<P>&quot;All right, that's enough,&quot; Giles said gently as he carefully reached out to remove the weapon from Joyce's hand before she could fire. &quot;We know what we need to.&quot;</P>
<P>Weak kneed, Spike sank down onto the couch. If it hadn't been <I>his</I> equipment at risk, he'd have been impressed, maybe even a little turned on. As it was, he was just severely relieved to not be missing one more aspect of his character that he considered more than a little important to his overall personality. On top of losing the ability to hurt, kill, maim, and generally create havoc amongst the human race, it would have been just too much for his ego to bear.</P>
<P>&quot;Xander,&quot; Giles clipped as he glanced at the young man.</P>
<P>Xander was already moving, gathering up the weapons they needed. &quot;I'm on it, G-man.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Anya broke in. &quot;Are you suggesting we go off to fight an infamous vamped Slayer? Because if you are, I have to say I think it's a really <I>bad</I> idea. Isn't that the sort of thing the Slayer is supposed to do? And since Buffy is apparently already off to do it--&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Anya, honey,&quot; Xander said too sweetly. &quot;Shut up, and start grabbing weapons.&quot;</P>
<P>Her eyebrows lifted in response as she was torn between outrage and arousal at his tone of command--or at least as close to a tone of command as Xander was ever likely to get. She finally settled on pouting as she moved to do as he'd told her. &quot;Well, if you're going to be like that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We can take my Bronco,&quot; Joyce inserted, still glaring balefully at Spike, who glared right back.</P>
<P>&quot;We?&quot; Giles repeated uncertainly. &quot;I really don't think you should--&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm coming,&quot; she said flatly. &quot;I will <I>not</I> be left out of my daughter's life one more time.&quot;</P>
<P>The two stared at each other for a long moment in a silent battle of wills, until, finally, it was Giles who looked away. &quot;Very well,&quot; he said at last. &quot;There's no time to argue about this.&quot;</P>
<P>Spike settled back onto the couch, making himself at ease now that he was comfortably certain the worst of the evening was over. &quot;Well, you all have a good time. I won't wait up for y--&quot; His words ended on a strangled gurgle as Giles yanked him to his feet by the collar.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, you're coming along, Spike,&quot; he snarled. &quot;Though it remains to be seen whether or not you'll be coming back.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If you insist,&quot; Spike drawled, but his already parchment-pale skin whitened another notch.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, I do,&quot; Giles murmured as he thrust the vampire toward the door, trusting Xander and Anya to handle transporting the weapons.</P>
