<!-- Whither Thou Goest \ Epilogue -->

<P>Buffy Summers slept; deeply, dreamlessly; the first slumber untainted by a confusing array of dreams and nightmares in months. Her only real movement after hours of utter stillness, was to turn and reach for the slender figure that should have been close in the small, dorm-room bed. She snapped awake as she abruptly realized she was alone.</P>
<P>A dull glow filled the other end of the room, the light from a laptop casting her lover's face in odd shadows. &quot;Will?&quot; she whispered, eyes hunting the darkness for any possible threats. She was still half afraid the Vampire-Slayer would return to come after them all.</P>
<P>Willow turned, rising easily and moving to join her lover. &quot;Shhh, it's okay,&quot; she whispered as she sat on the edge of the bed next to the Slayer. &quot;I couldn't sleep, so I was doing some research.&quot; She took a deep breath and reached out to stroke pale gold hair back from Buffy's brow, her touch impossibly tender.</P>
<P>&quot;What is it?&quot; Buffy questioned, sensing the hacker's unease.</P>
<P>A half smile touched Willow's mouth. &quot;Good news, bad news,&quot; she said by way of reply and slid her hand down to tangle it with Buffy's, lacing their fingers together and rubbing the rise of fine-boned knuckles. &quot;Kinda closely twined together, so no choices whether to get the good or bad first....&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And?&quot; Buffy prompted when Willow paused.</P>
<P>&quot;I think I've figured out why Giles did what he did when he ... he reworked our memories,&quot; the hacker said hesitantly.</P>
<P>Buffy's teeth gritted at the reminder of her Watcher's betrayal. &quot;Tell me,&quot; she growled after a beat, needing to understand.</P>
<P>&quot;It's tied to DuCourvallier ... what happened to her ... and the reason they ... the Watcher's Council, I mean ... well, why they ... dealt with her the way they did,&quot; Willow explained in halting syllables. &quot;And I think I may have figured out what that thing she turned into was ... the one that floated and wasn't a vamp or mortal looking,&quot; the hacker quickly added as if Buffy might now know what she was talking about.</P>
<P>Yet another incident Buffy didn't really need clarified. &quot;I remember,&quot; the Slayer exhaled. She wasn't likely to forget that thing any time soon. A delicate shudder rippled through her shoulders. &quot;What is it?&quot; She'd just assumed it was some new demon face, but Willow's tone implied something very different. Buffy couldn't decide whether that was part of the good news or the bad news.</P>
<P>The hacker took a deep breath and let it out to smooth over jangled nerves, then held up a hand to slow the questions, continuing with her quiet explanation. &quot;I was going through the stuff I downloaded earlier ... and also searching through some of books we brought ... really obscure Watcher volumes ... and judging by the dust on them, if Giles has ever opened them, it's been a lot of years. In the oldest one, I found the actual notes from DuCourvallier's trial. They don't match the version that's in the later volumes ... those were written long after everyone involved was dead....&quot; She trailed off for a moment.</P>
<P>&quot;Will,&quot; Buffy prompted firmly.</P>
<P>&quot;According to Giles and the more recent account, she was tried for murdering her Watcher's wife, but according to the trial notes ... and that's not it--&quot; The wiccan's eyes were wide and a little frightened. This didn't bode well.</P>
<P>&quot;What then?&quot; Buffy whispered, suddenly wondering if she'd made a mistake in not at least trying to stop the creature, if the crime was more serious than cold blooded murder.</P>
<P>&quot;She tried to flee ... <I>with</I> her Watcher's wife. She didn't kill her, Buffy, they were lovers. And the accusations don't say she killed Elizabeth VanOoten. They say she was responsible for her death.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Same thing, isn't it?&quot; the Slayer whispered in confusion, not understanding what Willow was trying to tell her at all.</P>
<P>&quot;Not necessarily ... especially not once you know that they didn't try Delaine DuCourvallier for murder. They tried her for moral perversity ... and for betraying her service to God and the Council.... Not necessarily in that order.&quot; Willow's voice was bitter. &quot;They killed her for being in love with another woman, Buffy.&quot; It would always have been a horrifying notion, but with the change in their relationship it became triply so. &quot;The more common version was written much later ... I don't think the changes were a mistake either. They knew what they'd done, and they didn't want future slayers to realize how far they were willing to go ... maybe they didn't want future watchers to know either.&quot; She swallowed hard. &quot;But they did come up with a cover story ... or maybe it's why they did it. I don't know.&quot; Her voice was ragged, the threat of tears making her hoarse.</P>
<P>&quot;What?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A prophecy ... that a Slayer, beloved of a woman, would destroy the council one day...unless the council destroys them both first.&quot; Willow lifted Buffy's hand, kissing her knuckles softly, gaining emotional succor from the delicate contact before continuing. &quot;I think that's why Giles did what he did,&quot; she whispered, &quot;to protect us ... because he was afraid they'd find out ... and come after you and I....&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy's jaw hardened, the look in her eyes horrified. She'd already ditched the council and its ham-handed efforts at controlling her, but if this was true....</P>
<P>&quot;When I knew what I was looking for,&quot; Willow continued, well aware of her lover's response to the information, though uncertain quite what it portended, &quot;I found the full prophecy in a later volume. The page was flagged with a Post-it, so I'm sure he knows about it.&quot; Giles' tendency toward Post-its was something of a joke among his young charges.</P>
<P>Feeling as though she'd been gut punched, Buffy bent nearly double, fighting to drag oxygen into her lungs, uncertain whether knowing the reasons for his betrayal made it easier or harder to bear. It made sense that he'd somehow been trying to protect them, but after months of nightmares and confusion -- not to mention being denied what her heart had come to need like oxygen -- it was hard to feel anything but profoundly deep anger at his actions. Buffy remembered the vampire's words. &quot;She said she loved her,&quot; she whispered after a beat. &quot;You're telling me they killed her for it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not exactly,&quot; Willow said softly. &quot;They didn't make it that easy; didn't just slit her throat and end it. No, they used some ancient rite of trial by combat. Bound her so she couldn't fight and tossed her into a pit of hungry vampires....&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy couldn't contain a sharp gasp of horror.</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah.&quot; Her voice thick with her own horror, Willow stared at their twined hands. &quot;She said&nbsp; that when she knew she was lost, she made a deal with the one thing she knew could kill them all....&quot; She shook her head. &quot;A vampire couldn't have done that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That thing we saw,&quot; Buffy exhaled, a sick well of dread forming in the pit of her stomach.</P>
<P>A quick nod. &quot;It said it was the betraying and the betrayed, the jailer and the imprisoned, architect of chaos and slave of fate.&quot; Willow was amazed she could regurgitate the words so easily. &quot;And it said it was the left of God and the right hand of the Morningstar.&quot;</P>
<P>The slayer shook her head, not understanding what Willow was saying.</P>
<P>&quot;The Morningstar is another name for Lucifer,&quot; Willow explained and saw Buffy's answering frown. &quot;It said it was the left hand of God and the right hand of the devil.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy's frown deepened as she struggled with the concept. During her time as the Slayer, she'd had to face things that could throw a dozen religious scholars into an agony of debate every night and twice on Sundays for millennia. Being the Slayer wasn't an occupation for anyone who didn't deal well with religious conundrums. As a result, she managed to deal with it most of the time through a distinctly secularized viewpoint. She dealt with demons and vampires on earth and left heaven and hell to other people to worry about. &quot;What does that mean exactly?&quot; she asked at last, strongly suspecting she didn't really want to know.</P>
<P>&quot;I think it's one of the Fallen ... one of the angels that sided with Lucifer when he rose up against God ... then was thrown into the Abyss -- the lowest, more horrific part of hell -- when Lucifer feared being betrayed in turn.&quot; She paused long enough to take a deep breath and let it out slowly. &quot;When she was on the verge of dying -- knowing she couldn't avenge herself or her lover -- I think Delaine DuCourvallier made a deal with the one thing she thought could. She didn't quite sell her soul to the devil ... just his assistant.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It said it,&quot; Buffy whispered, the haunting words coming back to her. &quot;When I asked it why, it told us what it was ... 'Fallen angels are angels still....'&quot; she quoted, then shook her head, the enormity of it all leaving her with the profound desire to hide under her bed and not come out again. She glanced down. It was big enough under there. They could both fit. And as far as she was concerned, if Willow was with her, everything was okay.</P>
<P>Willow nodded. &quot;And that's what it is ... a fallen angel.&quot; she whispered, as though saying it any louder might bring the wrath of heaven down upon them. &quot;One named Mulciber if I'm right.... According to a text I found, it sided with Lucifer when he made war on God.... God wanted the angels to worship man, and Mulciber swore to worship only his own art. He was an artist ... even built Lucifer's palace in hell ... named Chaos....&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Architect of Chaos,&quot; Buffy exhaled with sudden understanding. What had seemed simply like hyperbole and poetic language took on a whole new meaning with that little tidbit. She couldn't contain a tiny snort. &quot;So ... what? It wanted an artist's body.&quot;</P>
<P>Willow could only offer an uncertain shrug.</P>
<P>&quot;But somehow, she's in there too,&quot; Buffy exhaled, remembering what she'd seen after the creature. She'd seen it in the vampire's eyes ... the thing in her that had been, and somehow still was, the Slayer. &quot;I don't know how, but she is. And maybe a demon too for all I know.&quot;</P>
<P>Willow nodded. &quot;For what it's worth, I don't think it's evil.&quot; At Buffy's arch look, she offered a small, defensive shrug. &quot;I just don't think it's good either.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It just is,&quot; Buffy said at last with a degree of understanding. It was like the Slayer herself ... maybe all of the Slayers ... somehow too complex for the normal rules of morality. &quot;The question isn't whether it's good or evil, but what it wants....&quot; She looked at Willow hopefully.</P>
<P>All she got in return was a dazed head shake. &quot;I don't know,&quot; Willow admitted. &quot;I just don't know.&quot;</P>
<P>Blue eyes slid closed and then Buffy reached out, pulling her lover back into bed, needing the comfort of holding and being held.</P>
<P>&quot;What are we gonna do about Giles?&quot; the hacker asked as she slipped under the covers with Buffy, grateful to be wrapped safely in her lover's arms once again. Amazing how she could have missed something so much without even knowing it. She nuzzled into Buffy's shoulder and felt the Slayer pet her hair, her touch warm and soothing. &quot;If he finds out....&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We can't trust him,&quot; Buffy said regretfully and pressed a soft kiss to Willow's forehead, curving her hand along the side of her face to guide her chin up until their eyes met. &quot;We have to be careful ... keep this absolutely secret.&quot; She hated the idea, but it was the only way for the moment. &quot;At least until we know more.&quot; She kissed Willow softly, the brief touch little more than a butterfly wing's touch, then snuggled the redhead more firmly against her side under the blankets. For now, such hidden pleasures would have to be enough. She massaged Willow's back lightly, feeling the ripple of muscle as she slid her hand under the hacker's shirt to caress bare skin.</P>
<P>They were both silent for a long time, drawing strength and much needed comfort from feel of warm flesh, the smell of perfume and sweet breath, and the simple knowledge that they were together.</P>
<P>&quot;Do you think it's really gone for good?&quot; Willow asked at last, waiting a long beat before pushing up on her elbow to stare down at her lover. &quot;Buffy?&quot; she whispered after another long moment.</P>
<P>Reaching up to stroke silky red hair, Buffy offered an ironic smile, amazed at the twining of good and bad that always seemed to be an inherent part of her life. &quot;No,&quot; she whispered at last. She wanted it to be otherwise, but instinct told her they hadn't seen the last of the creature. Then she hooked a finger under Willow's chin, drawing her head up and finding soft lips with blind hunger. &quot;But we'll be okay,&quot; she breathed, between soft caresses and sweet kisses. Suddenly achingly in need of her lover's touch, she rolled Willow beneath her, linking their hands together as she pushed up on her elbows. &quot;Whatever happens, we'll be together.&quot;</P>
