<p><i>Thwocketa, thwocketa, thwocketa.</i></p>

<p>The coke bottle careened 'round and 'round on the tabletop before
finally coming to a halt, the narrow neck pointing toward Willow Rosenberg.</p>

<p>Cordelia Chase sighed dramatically. &quot;I can-<i>not</i> believe
I'm doing this with you two,&quot; she complained.</p>

<p>Buffy Summers looked up from the fingernails she was patiently
buffing--a killer bustup with a punk vamp the night before had left three shattered to the
quick--and grumbled softly. &quot;We could go back to studying,&quot; she pointed out,
&quot;since that is supposed to be the reason for this little get together&#133;at least
it was until <i>you </i>decided <i>you</i> were bored.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It would be different if there were some guys here,&quot;
Cordelia continued as though Buffy hadn't spoken, &quot;but please&#133;spin the bottle
with three girls&#133;where's the fun in that?&quot;</p>

<p>Willow, who always tried to make the best of things, no matter how
pointless the effort was, felt the need to insert, &quot;W-well, it could be
interesting&#133;if we just approach it with the right attitude.&quot;</p>

<p>Cordelia raised an eyebrow. &quot;Oh boy, Willow, and what sexually
charged question am I supposed to ask you? Have you optimized your hard drive this
week?&quot; She snorted impolitely. The cheerleader was in a bitchy mood--after all, once
upon a time she would have spent a Saturday night with the cool crowd instead of this
version of geeker heaven--and feeling the need to punish those she felt responsible for
her fall from grace. &quot;Yeah, right, that should make for some exciting
moments&#133;not.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy continued taking the jags off of her nails. Truth be told, she
couldn't really argue with Cordelia's point, though she wouldn't have phrased it quite
that way. Still Willow was her best friend, whereas Cordy was&#133;. What was Cordy?
Certainly not her friend&#133;exactly&#133;she was just sort of <i>there</i>. &quot;It was
<i>your </i>idea, Cordy,&quot; she pointed out blandly, noting Willow's grateful look out
of the corner of her eye. Willow was getting better at standing up to the cheerleader, but
after a lifetime of being stepped on by that clique, it wasn't natural just yet.</p>

<p>Cordelia's mouth opened, then snapped shut again. Fine, if it was
her idea then, &quot;All right&#133;&quot; she exhaled before following the direction of
their impromptu pointer. &quot;Willow,&quot; she said too sweetly, her voice sharp and her
eyes sharper.</p>

<p>Willow cringed inwardly. Cordelia always got nasty when she got<i>
that </i>look.</p>

<p>&quot;Since the boys aren't here and the point of the game
is&#133;titillation&#133;&quot; she drawled suggestively.</p>

<p>Buffy continued her buffing. She really wished they'd get back to
the studying. With her mom gone for most of the night, setting up a show at the gallery
(and hence, not interrupting with her Mom-ish efforts to help), patrol on hold for
midterms, and both Willow and Cordelia to help (there was something incredibly unfair
about the fact that Cordy always seemed to do well in her classes), she'd had some small
hope of actually passing a test for once&#133;at least she had until the uber-cheerleader
decided she was bored. Now, it was Buffy who was bored. Asking Cordelia about her first
kiss, or daring her to do something Buffy had no desire to see her do, was hardly her idea
of an exciting evening.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe you could tell us&#133;when you're staring so adoringly
at Buffy during fourth period&#133;is it because you want to be her&#133;or do you just
want her?'</p>

<p>Buffy's head snapped up. Now this was interesting. She was going to
have to decide whether to tear Cordy's head off, or simply strangle her with her own
tongue. She silently clucked her tongue. The decisions one had to make as the slayer.</p>

<p>Willow went pale and her brain completely blanked out for a brief
moment. &quot;I&#133;I&#133;uh&#133;&quot; she stammered.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Cordelia prodded. &quot;Lust&#133;much? Or
dare?&quot; Cordelia knew exactly how easily the other girl could be embarrassed and she
was suddenly enjoying herself. Maybe this game could be fun with only girls after all.
&quot;I'll have to think of something really nasty,&quot; she added for good measure,
pleased to see a familiar light of fear in Willow's eyes. She hadn't seen that look in
quite a while now, and she decided she'd missed it.</p>

<p>&quot;You might want to rethink that strategy,&quot; Buffy growled
in warning.</p>

<p>Willow swallowed hard. She'd made a pact with herself months before,
not to let Cordy intimidate her anymore, and, aside from a few slips, she'd mostly managed
to stick to it. She was damned if she was going to chicken out now. Cordelia Chase had
always had a way of hitting her jugular that was ominously accurate, but she couldn't let
that paralyze her anymore. &quot;No, Buffy, it's okay&#133;&quot; she insisted, and if her
voice cracked, well, it was only a tiny squeak. Hardly even noticeable. <i>You can do
this, </i>she reminded herself.</p>

<p>The Slayer saw her friend's chin come up, her eyes full of
determination, and grinned. When Willow got that look, she could be downright lethal. Her
eyes flicked over. By the look of it, Cordelia had noticed as well and was starting to
look a little uneasy. The Slayer leaned back in her chair, standing down&#133;for the
moment.</p>

<p>Willow offered a saccharine smile. &quot;Gee, Cordelia, I was just
wondering what it would be like to be <i>the</i> Slayer.&quot;</p>

<p>The cheerleader looked annoyed that Willow hadn't remained cowed the
way she was supposed to, but it was occurring to her that maybe she'd overstepped her
bounds.</p>

<p>&quot;But there's one thing I don't get,&quot; Willow admitted with
mock innocence. &quot;Buffy sits right in front of me, so watching her is really
easy&#133;in fact it's kind of hard to avoid, but you sit next to her, which means I
sit&#133;behind you&#133;for you to watch me would be really difficult&#133;so why are you
paying so much attention to what I'm looking at?&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy almost choked on her tongue, while Cordy just choked, her face
turning an interesting shade of purple. The cheerleader's eyes flashed and Buffy found
herself wondering if her friend hadn't bitten off more than she could chew. Still, it
definitely wasn't dull anymore.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Willow reached out and spun the bottle with an elegant
twist of the wrist. She'd practiced this one for years in the vague hope that she'd be
playing with Xander one day. Well, that wasn't gonna happen anytime soon, and if Willow
was honest with herself, she didn't really want it to anymore. That particular emotion had
fallen by the wayside somewhere over the past year.</p>

<p><i>Thwocketa, thwocketa, thwocketa</i>. And the bottle came to a
halt.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh&#133;look, Cordy, it's pointing at you,&quot; Willow
commented with wide-eyed innocence.</p>

<p>The cheerleader was smart enough to be worried.</p>

<p>Buffy straightened in her chair. Interesting and more interesting.</p>

<p>&quot;Soooo,&quot; Willow drawled knowingly, her eyes threatening
Cordy more eloquently than words. She was gaining confidence from the uncertainty in her
childhood tormentor's eyes. The two teens had known each other a long time, and while
Willow might not have traveled in Cordelia's circle of friends, she knew secrets. Whoa
boy, did she know secrets. She leaned forward, a faint smile tugging at her lips. Cordelia
must have sensed her impending doom because faint nervousness was fast turning to extreme
tension. &quot;Truth or dare, Cordelia, have you ever kissed a girl?&quot; Willow asked
sweetly. If Cordy wanted to attack on that particular front&#133;well, she could do that
too.</p>

<p>Buffy sat straight up. Very, <i>very </i>interesting. Her eyes swung
back and forth between the other two teens. Willow was smiling triumphantly, while
Cordelia had gone from purple to stark white.</p>

<p>&quot;You swore you'd never&#133;&quot; the cheerleader started to
say, then fell silent abruptly as she realized how closely Buffy was watching the
encounter. It had only happened the one time, and it was pure accident that Willow had
been there, already in the restroom, when Harmony told her cute she was and kissed
her&#133;and she hadn't liked it at all&#133;well, not that much, anyway. Okay, so Harmony
knew how to kiss, and maybe she <i>had</i> responded, but they'd both threatened the
smaller, far less cool girl into total submission, and Willow had sworn she'd never tell
anyone. So as long as nobody else knew, Cordelia could pretend it had never happened. It
had never occurred to her that Willow might not honor a promise made under that kind of
duress. Actually, it had never occurred to her that she might not always be able to put
the other girl under that kind of duress.</p>

<p>Willow was still smiling triumphantly. &quot;Truth or dare?&quot;
she repeated the challenge.</p>

<p>Cordelia's eyes narrowed. She really hated it when it looked like
someone else might win a confrontation. So, fine, if Willow wanted to play truth or
dare&#133;. &quot;Dare,&quot; she said, her voice raw with provocation.</p>

<p>Buffy's gaze swung back, wondering how her friend would react. These
two were so locked in combat, she had no idea what they'd do next.</p>

<p>It was Willow's turn to flinch. She really didn't have a plan for
that contingency. This was why she'd learned to be a mouse in the corner. Whenever her
temper got the better of her, it just got her into trouble. She saw triumph flash in her
opponent's eyes and felt her temper flare anew. She didn't know what she was going to say
next. It wasn't a plan. She just opened her mouth and the words came out. &quot;Why don't
you kiss a girl now.&quot; Willow couldn't believe she'd said the words, but there they
were, hanging on the air between them all.</p>

<p>Buffy leaned back in her chair, both brows threatening to hide in
her bangs, while she folded her arms across her chest in a distinctly, <i>&quot;It's your
problem, now, guys&quot;</i> posture. She considered putting a stop to the game--it was
bordering on getting really nasty--but she wasn't sure she wanted to get in the middle of
things. Besides, she was about as far from boredom central as it was possible to be
without falling off the edge of the world.</p>

<p>Cordy didn't move.</p>

<p>&quot;Well?&quot; Willow prompted, uncertain what demon was making
her push so hard. Maybe it was the fact that Cordelia was with Xander now, maybe it was
the years of petty torments, or maybe it was the fact that once upon a time she'd had a
few fantasies of being Harmony and kissing Cordelia until she couldn't see straight. God,
she'd hated that; feeling turned on by her worst enemy.</p>

<p>Cordelia stared at Willow for a long moment, then suddenly rose from
her chair, stalking around the side of the small card table they'd been using for the
studying&#133;and other things&#133;.</p>

<p>Willow's head tipped back as she peered up at the taller girl. For
some reason she'd just assumed--if she'd thought anything, which seemed doubtful at that
moment--that Cordelia would kiss Buffy if she kissed anyone (and truthfully, she hadn't
thought Buffy would allow it anyway). Somehow, the thought of Cordelia Chase getting that
close to computer geek, Willow Rosenberg, was just beyond consideration. Her heart
literally stopped for a brief second as a slender hand came down, hooking under her chin.
Another hand found the nape of her neck, curled into her blouse, pulling her up.</p>

<p>Willow instinctively tried to escape, backing into the wall a foot
or so away. Cordelia kept her grip solidly in place, following her, pressing close.
&quot;What's the matter, afraid to finish what you started?&quot; the cheerleader
challenged. &quot;Afraid you might like it. &quot;Then she ducked her head. It was a kiss
designed to conquer, one she'd perfected with a series of quarterbacks, star forwards, and
other assorted big men on campus, and utilized with considerable effect to keep Xander
thorougly in line. So far, none of the boys had managed to even remain firmly on their
feet when she resorted to the big guns. She had complete faith it would do the same to
anyone else she chose. Gender was irrelevant. It was a no-holds-barred, take-no-prisoners
oral caress that promised every kind of sensual pleasure available to a human being. She
didn't have to demand entry; Willow's lips opened on a gasp, inviting her deeper, while
she instinctively clawed a hand into a silky shirt front, dragging elegant curves even
closer to her own body. How long it lasted, she didn't know, but her body was fast melting
into a puddle of thick, hot arousal. Suddenly, Cordelia braced her hands against the wall
on either side of Willow, pushing away from her with a soft sigh. &quot;Was that good
enough for you?&quot; she demanded huskily near a delicate ear.</p>

<p>As far as Cordelia was concerned that was match point.</p>

<p>The computer geek could only shake her head in confusion, her brain
misfiring as she felt her knees buckle. Groaning low in her throat, she slowly slid down
the wall at her back into a sitting position, leaning her forehead onto her upthrust
knees. God, she couldn't believe this had happened, couldn't believe she'd responded the
way she had. She just wanted to crawl into a hole and pull it in after herself.</p>

<p>&quot;That'll teach you to play with the big girls,&quot; Cordy said
triumphantly and Willow withered a little more, hiding her face more deeply in her knees.
How did Cordelia always manage to make her feel about two inches tall?</p>

<p><i>Thwocketa, thwocketa, thwocketa.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Oooo&#133;looks like it's <i>my</i> turn,&quot; Buffy said as
Cordy's head came around in response to the sound. Her eyes went wide as Buffy caught the
bottle and calmly spun it the rest of the way around until it was pointing at her. Their
gazes locked and held, each challenging the other in some perverse way.</p>

<p>Cordelia folded her arms across her chest, silently waiting. What
had begun as a silly game to relieve the boredom of an overnight study session had become
something else entirely.</p>

<p>&quot;Soooo&#133;.have you ever kissed a girl&#133;excluding this
little display&#133;which I would have classed more as an assault than a kiss,&quot; Buffy
demanded, her look warning the brunette just whose side she was on in this little game.
&quot;And believe me, you do not want to hear what the dare will be,&quot; she warned.</p>

<p>Cordelia looked away, not wanting to admit the truth, but knowing
that she was cornered. If she quit, then Buffy--and by proxy, Willow--won. And that would
not do. Dare? Buffy was right, she didn't want to hear what that would be. Cordy was
blessed with a considerable sense of survival after all. &quot;Yes,&quot; she admitted
grudgingly. &quot;I was fourteen. It was Harmony, and the geekerette,&quot; she nodded her
head toward the still sitting Willow, &quot;saw it.&quot; She reached out. She had no
intention of losing.</p>

<p>Only one <i>thwocketa</i> this time, and it was a slow one as
Cordelia deliberately turned the bottle so that it pointed at Buffy.</p>

<p>&quot;Truth or dare; why is it always Willow you worry about
first?&quot; she demanded. &quot;Just good friends, or was your psycho boyfriend onto
something when he listed her up there with your mom as one of those you love most in this
world?&quot; When Buffy didn't immediately answer, Cordelia pressed the taunts a little
farther. &quot;Or maybe you decided to try the girls&#133;since your efforts with the boys
left such a high body-count.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Over the line, Cordelia,&quot; Buffy said tightly, rage
glittering in her eyes.</p>

<p>The cheerleader only offered a brittle, victorious smile.
&quot;Truth or dare?&quot; she repeated.</p>

<p>Buffy swallowed hard, eyes narrowing just as Willow looked up, her
expression wide-eyed and still a bit dazed. &quot;Dare,&quot; she snarled. She wasn't
going to dignify that one with an answer, but she also bloody well wasn't going to let the
cheerleader get the last word in.</p>

<p>Even Cordelia was shocked at her own behavior. It was like someone
else had taken over her body, but she just couldn't seem to pull back. &quot;Why
don&#146;t you kiss her, Buffy. See which one she likes best.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow snapped to her feet as though she'd had a thousand volts put
through her. She ran a shaky hand through her hair, pushing it back from her face.
&quot;I-I think we need to stop this,&quot; she croaked raggedly. It was all spinning out
of control, and she was frankly scared. It was like she was the only one of the three who
sensed a huge cliff looming ahead and was trying to divert away from it.</p>

<p>Cordelia's smile broadened. God, she loved to win, even when she
knew she shouldn't.</p>

<p>That's what did it. That damn smug smile. Buffy stepped around
Cordelia. &quot;It's okay, Will,&quot; she whispered, then reached out, brushing the soft
skin of her friend's cheek, feeling the flutter of silky red hair against her fingertips.
&quot;We won't let her win.&quot; The kiss was intended to be a tiny, nonsexual peck on
the lips, the sort of thing she might have shared with an aging uncle or a boy who was
just a friend. Was intended&#133;except it didn't work out that way. The first brush of
their lips was soft, delicate, sweet...and not nearly so innocent as Buffy had intended.
After Cordelia's Alexander the Great impression, it was twice as erotic as anything else
she might have done.</p>

<p>Willow moaned very softly, the tiny sound an open invitation. When
she'd realized Buffy was going to kiss her, there was a moment where she fully intended
not to respond at all, but that determination drained away all too quickly. She was
aroused, achingly, desperately aroused--certain in the knowledge that this kind of contact
would never happen again--and she simply couldn't refuse the opportunity. Her mouth
slipped open, tongue darting out to tease soft lips. Almost instantly, she heard Buffy's
low answering groan and felt her lean closer.</p>

<p>Maybe it was just experimentation, frustration, her own confused
emotions, or maybe Angelus really had seen something she wasn't aware of yet. Buffy didn't
know and in that instant, she didn't care. She pressed forward, deepening the kiss,
tasting the softness of her friend's mouth with sudden hunger. Her hands slid into silky
hair, holding Willow close as their bodies instinctively strained to get nearer, sweet
curves molding together from hip to chest.</p>

<p>Cordelia stood perfectly still, her face a shocked mask. This was
not what she had expected--not at all--and it left her with the oddest sense that she'd
just lost a whole lot more than some silly confrontation over a game. Okay, so she had
enjoyed Harmony's kiss, but kissing Willow had been about winning, not kissing. Her two
friends--oh God, they were <i>friends</i>--and just when had that rather nauseating little
detail happened--were pressed hard against the wall, mouths and bodies blending together
with desperate passion, reminding Cordy once again of that incident more than two years
before. It had all been Harmony's idea, and later she'd had more ideas, laughing as she
lamented all the things they hadn't done to their smaller classmate&#133;sexy, dangerous
things. At the time, Cordelia had been faintly appalled, though she'd hidden it
well--Harmony was no gentler with her friends than her victims--but secretly, a part of
her had been excited. She'd lain in bed that night--and other nights--trying to imagine
all of the things Harmony had whispered about, uncertain exactly how the mechanics worked,
but aroused all the same. During the days, she'd teased and tormented Willow and her
friends, enjoying an almost sexual charge from the ongoing displays of power, while the
nights were reserved for more intimate fantasy displays of power. A few months later, the
nighttime fantasies had faded away, forgotten in the wake of time and her own awakening
awareness of her power as a beautiful young woman, but now she remembered them all.</p>

<p>Lost in the kiss, Buffy had all but forgotten Cordelia. Her entire
focus was on the taste of her best friend's mouth and the feel of her body&#133;and the
effect they were having on her own body. Her muscles were taut, heart hammering in her
chest, a thin sheen of sweat on her skin, arousal thick and sweet moving through her
veins. She remembered another moment; Willow on the stairs, dressed like a hooker for
Halloween. It was the first time she'd noticed her friend's body--the soft supple curves
and well toned muscles--though she'd ignored the flash of unwanted desire that had burned
through her even then. She'd been both disappointed and oddly relieved when the redhead
had panicked and thrown a ghost costume over the ensemble. &quot;Willow,&quot; she groaned
through the meeting of their lips, hesitantly breaking away, leaning forehead against her
friend's. She slid a hand down, curving it to Willow's slender waist, well aware of the
way she was trembling gently. They were both breathing hard, gasping like marathon runners
at the end of a race.</p>

<p>Cordelia watched them--the gentle tenderness that flowed between her
friends, despite the situation--and she found her teeth gritting against hot jealousy.
Nobody was ever like that with her, not even Xander, her <i>supposed</i> boyfriend. He
worried more about--cared more about, if she was honest--Willow and Buffy than he did her.
Sometimes she thought he was downright ashamed of the desire that heated the space between
them whenever they were in the same room. &quot;Well, I guess that answers the question
about who prefers the girls,&quot; she jeered. It wasn't even something she cared about
normally. Truth be told, she'd always figured it made a certain amount of sense; boys
weren't nearly as a good company as girls, and if you had good taste and picked someone
who was more or less the same size, a girl could double her wardrobe for free. But, with
teenage accuracy, she understood that it was something they'd all be raised to fear and be
ashamed of, something that Willow specifically had always feared, knowing it would just be
one more thing to make her a target for her lifelong tormentors. One more way in which she
would be different.</p>

<p>Buffy heard Willow's soft whimper and felt the tremor that rattled
through her narrow frame. &quot;Bitch,&quot; she snarled as her head came around. She was
really angry this time, not just the usual frustrated irritation that came with dealing
with Cordelia Chase, but genuinely, furiously, out of control angry. Not a safe place for
any of them. &quot;Must be really hard on your ego, Cordy, to know that everyone cares
more about the class geek than they do you.&quot; They were words she normally never would
have used--she knew how they hurt Willow when others used them, even in teasing--and she
regretted them the moment they were past her lips, but they were out and that was that.
And judging by the way the cheerleader paled, her eyes narrowing with rage, they'd hit
home there as well.</p>

<p>Cordelia drew breath, dark eyes flashing as she got ready to unload
all over both of them. She'd just had enough of playing the nice tag-along to the bottom
of the barrel crowd. Now, it was time for the real Cordelia Chase to make an appearance.</p>

<p>&quot;No more,&quot; Willow broke in suddenly. She felt Buffy's
loose hold start to tighten and shoved her hands aside. She was trembling violently, but
she wasn't going to let this go on any longer. She wasn't going to be a damn bone they
dragged back and forth between them, each trying to win some perverse argument that had
grown out of a stupid game.</p>

<p>Buffy's head swung back around, taking in her friend's pale face,
the way her eyes seemed to dominate her whole face; liquid green pools of hurt. She
started to reach out to her. &quot;Oh God, Will, I'm--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't,&quot; the redhead cut the apology short and knocked her
hand aside before it could make contact. The gaze that met Buffy's was bitterly accusing,
making the slayer ashamed of the way she'd lost control and unintentionally used words
guaranteed to hurt a friend.</p>

<p>Even Cordy seemed to have pulled up short, her expression uncertain.
Unfortunately, desire, jealousy, anger, and the need to win were still pulsing through her
veins; a dangerous mix at the best of times&#133;which this definitely wasn't. &quot;Does
that mean Buffy wins our little competition?&quot; she asked, her expression a mimicry of
genuine interest.</p>

<p>Buffy started to reply, inhaled to begin her tirade, then held back
as she heard a tiny sound, no more than the softest of whimpers. Her breath caught, chin
coming back around to take in delicate features.</p>

<p>Sharp nails dug into small hands as Willow faced her friend's
piercing gaze. Sometimes it seemed as though Buffy saw everything, and others she would
have sworn the slayer couldn't see what was right in front of her. The redhead's knees
were close to buckling and she wanted to dissolve into a puddle of tears, though she
controlled it well enough that only one or two edged her eyes in silver. Willow hated
these things, the nasty confrontations and bitter words. She hated them and had too soft a
heart for them. Even when she won--which wasn't often by any means--she felt like she
lost.</p>

<p>The look in green eyes was like a blow to Buffy's midsection.
&quot;Get out,&quot; she snarled without looking back at Cordelia.</p>

<p>A heartbeat later, sensing the cheerleader hadn't moved, she swung
her head around, spearing the other girl with a dangerous look. &quot;I don't care if it's
out of my room, out of my house, or out of my life, but <i>get out!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>Cordelia was standing perfectly still, pale, her eyes huge brown
saucers in her face. In that instant, that tiny moment when she'd heard Willow's small cry
and finally really <i>seen</i> the look in her eyes, it had all come home; exactly what
she'd done&#133;and why. She didn't move&#133;<i>couldn't </i>move. &quot;Willow,&quot;
she whispered, her voice a rough creak. She hadn't apologized many times in her life; she
barely even knew how. &quot;I-I&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>Willow's teeth dug into her lower lip and she couldn't hold the
tears back any longer. With anger to bolster her, she'd just barely been able to keep
things together. Without it, her knees turned to water and the world was suddenly awash in
a field of blue. She felt Buffy's arm tighten on her waist, cushioning her slide and
barely heard her angry shout.</p>

<p>&quot;I said get out!&quot;</p>

<p>The sound of the bedroom door slamming shut echoed through the small
room only a moment later. A second or two after that, the muffled sound of the front door
followed.</p>

<p>&quot;Will?&quot; Buffy's voice was low and worried, so close to her
ear that soft hair fluttered with her breath.</p>

<p><i>Get it under control</i>, Willow's inner voice snapped
impatiently, <i>you don't have time for self-pity</i>. She drew a deep breath and let it
out slowly. Without Cordelia there to aggravate the situation, things were still
salvageable. &quot;I'm fine,&quot; she mumbled at last. Not entirely true, but the only
thing she could think of to say that wouldn't make things a whole lot worse.</p>

<p>Buffy curved a hand to a slender shoulder, giving it a light
squeeze, well aware of the warmth of her friend's body through the thin fabric of her
blouse. &quot;If this is fine,&quot; she said dryly. &quot;I don't think I want to be
there when you have a bad day.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow let out a deep, shuddery breath as she reached up to massage
her eye sockets, sniffling back on the no longer quite so imminent tears. She pushed to
her feet abruptly, stepping away from Buffy to stare out her bedroom window. Her shoulders
were shaking, but she managed to keep her voice reasonably calm as she muttered, &quot;I
don't know why I let Cordelia get to me like that.&quot; She pushed the window open to
lean out into the chill night air, letting it cool overheated emotions in hopes of
clearing her head. Goddamn Cordelia for finding her Achilles heel one more time.</p>

<p>Buffy pushed gracefully to her feet, following close behind her
friend. &quot;Because you have a soft heart&#133;and things affect you&#133;&quot; Buffy
started to say something else, then changed her mind. She leaned close, but didn't touch,
uncertain how welcome physical contact would be at that moment. Besides, her own nerve
endings were still jangling and she didn't think it would help <i>that</i> situation. <i>Thank
you, hormones</i>--she thought sarcastically--<i>you just had to be in overdrive tonight,
didn't you</i>. <i>Now, Willow probably thinks I'm going to jump her</i>. &quot;I'm sorry
&#133;about what happened&#133;I hope you know, I wouldn't intentionally hurt you for
anything&#133;&quot; Buffy trailed off, not knowing how to express herself under the
circumstances. How does one apologize for shoving one's tongue down one's best friend's
throat?</p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; Willow croaked. Damn, the tears were trying to
make a showing again. She made a soft disgusted sound in the back of her throat and wiped
at one that threatened to spill onto her cheeks.</p>

<p>Buffy raked slender fingers through her hair, scraping it back from
her face, her expression a mask of frustration. &quot;Look Will,&quot; she began again.
&quot;It's not that big a deal&#133;. I-I think Giles would just say that some teenage
hormones got out of control and a little&#133;experimentation&#133;resulted...&quot;
Willow didn't respond and Buffy found herself feeling the need to fill the uncomfortable
silence. &quot;It doesn't mean any--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't,&quot; Willow snapped, cutting her off as she spun
around. Delicate fingers landed on Buffy's lips, silencing her. &quot;Don't say it doesn't
mean anything,&quot; the redhead whispered huskily. &quot;Just don't.&quot;</p>

<p>She pulled away, leaving a startled, silent Buffy behind. A long
moment later, the slayer pivoted on one foot to watch as her friend plucked her stuffed
pig, Mr. Gordo, off a freestanding bookshelf. Willow enveloped the toy in a tight hug.
&quot;Okay,&quot; Buffy exhaled cautiously at last. Willow was turned partially away, her
cheek pressed against the fake fur toy. &quot;Can you tell me what's happening here?&quot;</p>

<p>The redhead shook her head without looking up. Buffy eased closer to
her friend, carefully reaching out to catch a few strands of red hair between her fingers.
It was cool and silky against her skin. Willow's new hairstyle looked good, made her look
older and highlighted her delicate bone structure, but Buffy found herself missing the way
she'd worn it so long before. More than once, she'd lain playing with it--braiding the
long strands, or just toying with them--while they watched a movie on tv, or listened to
music. It had been safe then, with Xander sitting only a foot or two away, to explore and
take pleasure from the texture&#133;just like it had been safe for the three of them to
dance together&#133;or go clubbing&#133;and if was Willow's hand that she held, or her arm
she hooked in her own when they walked down a dark alley&#133;well, that was only so that
Xander wouldn't get any more unwelcome ideas than he already had&#133;. Wasn't it?</p>

<p>Oh&#133;God&#133;Willow was right, Buffy realized in a flash. It
wasn't <i>nothing</i>. The knowledge made her want to crawl into a dark cave and hide.
God, she had enough to deal with in her life. Her relationship with Angel had been so
overwhelming that she somehow hadn't noticed that she'd responded to her friend on more
than a just a friendly level.</p>

<p>But Angelus had seen it. That was why&#133;.</p>

<p>She stopped right there, shivering as though someone had walked over
her grave. She didn't realize she'd moved her fingers from silky hair to a narrow shoulder
until Willow tensed under her hand. She started to yank her hand back, but froze. She
didn't know what demon it was that made her ask, but she suddenly had to know. &quot;Do
you do that, Willow&#133;watch me?&quot; <i>And what do you want the answer to be, Buffy
Summers</i>--her internal voice demanded wryly--<i>because either way, you've got some
serious things to attend to</i>. The muscles under her hand tensed to marble solidity.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>They were standing a scant foot from the card table, still
surrounded by the books and half eaten snacks that were a testament to how the evening had
begun. Buffy glanced back, noting the bottle still sitting there, taunting her with the
results of the night's game. She wasn't <i>going</i> to do it&#133;but somehow&#133;she
did.</p>

<p><i>Thwocketa, thwocketa, thwocketa.</i> The sound echoed through the
small room with eerie intensity.</p>

<p>&quot;Truth or dare, Willow,&quot; she whispered when it came to a
halt. &quot;<i>Do</i> you watch me during fourth period?&quot;</p>

<p>Willow buried her cheek deeper in pink fake fur. If she answered,
that made it real in a way their game hadn't. Up till now, it was all something that could
be ignored, forgotten, chalked up to youthful hormones, and shoved safely into the
backalley's of the mind where denial was king. She had a wonderful boyfriend, one who
genuinely cared about her, and wouldn't hurt her for anything, so why had a kiss on dare
from Buffy made here body react on a level that far exceeded anything she'd ever felt with
Oz?</p>

<p>&quot;Willow?&quot; Buffy prodded very gently. She was almost as
scared as her friend, but her personality wouldn't let her put her emotions back in cold
storage. &quot;Truth&#133;<i>or dare?</i>&quot;</p>

<p><i>Lie. Just answer no</i>--Willow's inner voice insisted--<i>it's
the coward's way out, but it's safer in the long run</i>. Her tongue brushed against the
roof of her mouth, preparatory to beginning the <i>n</i> sound. &quot;Yes,&quot; she
answered instead, wondering where that had come from even as she said it.</p>

<p>Buffy let out a breath she hadn't been aware of holding. Willow was
trembling faintly as the slayer lifted her other hand, cupping both of her friend's
shoulders in a firm but gentle grip. Her heart was pounding violently in her chest.
&quot;It's okay,&quot; she whispered as much to soothe her own jangled nerves as to calm
her friend. She massaged taut muscles with the pads of her thumbs, tugging Willow back
until they were pressed back to chest. Her breath ruffled soft red strands of hair.
&quot;We'll be okay.&quot; She lifted a hand, petting the other girl's hair tenderly,
sifting through the silky threads. &quot;Look at me,&quot; she whispered very softly.</p>

<p>Willow slowly lifted her head from the comfort of the stuffed toy,
gingerly turning her head to peer over her shoulder at Buffy. Huge green eyes stared out
of delicate features, reflecting Buffy's face back at her.</p>

<p>Buffy reached out, brushing a gentle fingertip along Willow's cheek,
amazed by the velvet texture of her skin. &quot;You're beautiful,&quot; she breathed, her
tone startled as though she'd noticed it for the first time. It was true. The gawky teen
she'd first met was fast being replaced by a stunning young woman. Why hadn't she noticed
that before &#133;or had she and just not wanted to see?</p>

<p>Willow shook her head. &quot;No&#133;you&#133;you're the beautiful
one,&quot; she whispered, unable to believe what was happening. &quot;Beautiful&#133;and
brave&#133;and-and&#133;you've saved my life so many times&#133;.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Usually because I'm the one who put it in danger,&quot; Buffy
sighed, but Willow shook her head.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she disagreed simply. She shook free of Buffy's
gentle hold and pivoted to face her. &quot;You protect us all...do something no one should
have to...you're so brave....&quot;</p>

<p>The Slayer stared deeply into green eyes, amazed by the intensity
glowing in their depths. &quot;You're the brave one,&quot; she said softly. &quot;You
don't have to get involved, but you do.&quot; She reached out, brushing her fingertips
along a smooth cheek, dusting a few stray strands of red hair aside. Her eyes dropped,
touching on full lips, and she felt her body respond to the memory of their earlier kiss.
Still staring at Willow, she reached back, finding the bottle by feel.</p>

<p><i>Thwocketa, thwocketa, thwocketa.</i> This time, the sound had an
oddly friendly feel to it.</p>

<p>&quot;Truth or dare,&quot; Buffy whispered, her voice hoarse with
tension. &quot;Would you like me to kiss you again?&quot;</p>

<p>Willow looked away, feeling shy again, though a faint nervous smile
touched her lips. &quot;Shouldn't it be my turn?&quot; she deflected the question.</p>

<p>&quot;So&#133;you can have two turns in the next round,&quot; Buffy
promised, desperate for an answer that had nothing to do with the game anymore.</p>

<p>In answer, Willow reached past her friend, giving the plastic bottle
a quick spin.</p>

<p><i>Thwocketa, thwocketa, thwocketa.</i> The rumbling rattle suddenly
became downright erotic.</p>

<p>&quot;Truth or dare,&quot; Willow husked. &quot;Do you want me to
want you to kiss me?&quot;</p>

<p>It took Buffy a moment to sort out the convoluted sentence and
decide for certain that Willow was asking her what she thought. &quot;God, yes,&quot; she
breathed at last. She was startled a brief moment later when Willow's fingers touched her
lips, outlining the soft cupid's bow. A second later, she was the one being kissed as the
redhead darted forward, just barely dusting her mouth against her friend's.</p>

<p>It was a tiny kiss, soft and brief, the contact seemingly too fast
to send such a powerful jolt through the slayer. Foreverafter though, Buffy would think of
those tiny caresses as Willow-kisses. Sweet and innocent, but sensual and tenderly-erotic
at the same time. A low groan slipped from her parted lips as the tiny caresses ended.
Buffy blinked and found she was gasping for air. &quot;Truth or dare,&quot; she gasped,
&quot;can I kiss you now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dare,&quot; Willow challenged. Now that she knew Buffy was
interested, she was actually feeling surprisingly confident.</p>

<p>The slayer's lips quirked at the provocation. &quot;Feeling brave
are you?&quot; she whispered.</p>

<p>&quot;A little,&quot; Willow admitted.</p>

<p>&quot;Kiss me again&#133;&quot; Buffy dared, &quot;but slowly this
time.&quot;</p>

<p>No other part of their bodies touched as Willow leaned forward,
tasting warm lips. The first touch was faint, moving slowly against the slayer's mouth,
then it grew like a whirlwind. It wasn't really one kiss, but dozens of kisses blended
into one; brushing, caressing, moving away until contact was almost broken before
returning to deepen the heady caress. When it finally broke, they leaned their heads
together, red and blond hair blending where their foreheads touched. Buffy took a deep
breath and let it out slowly to clear her head. &quot;You&#133;uh&#133;do that well,&quot;
she groaned. She was still catching her breath when Willow reached past her.</p>

<p><i>Thwocketa, thwocketa, thwocketa.</i> Buffy was amazed to find
that sound fast becoming the most sensual thing she'd ever heard.</p>

<p>&quot;Truth or dare?&quot; Willow's voice was right next to her ear,
her soft breath playing with soft blond strands.</p>

<p>&quot;Dare,&quot; Buffy exhaled. If Willow could do it, so could
she. Willow's breath tickled her ear as she laughed softly, and Buffy felt an answering
surge of heat move through her veins.</p>

<p>&quot;You kiss me this time.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy's head came up, eyes studying Willow with careful intensity. A
second later, she trailed her palms up her friend's chest, just barely brushing over the
soft curves before sliding on up, brushing her fingertips lightly up the slender column of
Willow's throat and cupping her face in strong hands. Where Willow's kisses were
incredibly soft and gentle, Buffy's were firmer, more authoritative. Her tongue danced
over soft lips, then pressed inside, running over sharp teeth then tangling with its mate.
She tasted Willow's soft groan and deepened the kiss. &quot;I want to feel you,&quot; she
admitted when their lips parted. She reached back without looking.</p>

<p><i>Thwocketa, thwocketa, thwocketa.</i></p>

<p>&quot;Dare,&quot; Buffy whispered, without even offering any other
options. &quot;Lie down with me.&quot; She felt Willow stiffen, knew that maybe she'd gone
one step too far, and wished she'd kept her mouth shut, wished she'd...waited.</p>

<p>&quot;I've never&#133;&quot; the other girl started to whisper only
to trail off.</p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; Buffy whispered and smoothed her hands along the
breadth of Willow's shoulders, &quot;and we won't&#133;&quot; Tension rippled through her
muscles, &quot;do any more than we're ready for&#133;.&quot; She was startled a heartbeat
later, when Willow dragged her close, lips meeting the slayer's in a hungry kiss. Buffy
lost track of everything except the body pressed against her own. When they finally
tumbled onto the bed, rolled on top, straddling slender hips as she tasted her lips
hungrily, pressing her into the sheets with the force of her passion.</p>

<p>Willow's entire universe narrowed down to the woman above her; the
feel her lips, her hands, the warmth of her body. Nothing else existed except the
sensations running riot over her own nerve endings. Her blouse slipped open, followed by
her bra, then she felt the warmth of human hands--other than her own--against sensitive
flesh for the first time in her life. A low moan escaped her parted lips and she thrust
her hands under Buffy's blouse, spreading them against the bare skin of her stomach,
before slipping around her waist to her lower back.</p>

<p>More kisses and caresses followed as each teen experimented with
their newfound power to arouse.</p>

<p>Clothes were tugged and pushed aside, expanding the boundaries of
bare flesh making contact with bare flesh. Buffy heard a soft whimper, then realized it
was her own voice she was hearing. Suddenly, she leaned forward on her elbows, burying her
face in the curve of Willow's shoulder, while her fingers threaded through silky strands
of hair. &quot;We've gotta stop,&quot; she groaned, amazed by her own self-control. Her
body was a giant, throbbing ache and if they didn't quit soon, she wasn't sure how much of
an option it was going to be.</p>

<p>Willow groaned low in her throat, head falling back on her shoulders
to rest against Buffy's spread hands. She was breathing hard, her skin damp with sweat and
intensely aware of feel of skin and soft curves pressed against her own. &quot;Oh, my
God,&quot; she exhaled.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Buffy whispered near her ear, wondering if this
was the torture Angel had gone through all those times he'd called a halt before things
got out of control. Being the more experienced one was hell, she decided in a rush. She
swallowed hard, moistening her lips. &quot;It's too soon.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;We don't know quite what we're doing yet,&quot; Buffy added.</p>

<p>Another nod.</p>

<p>&quot;And am I the only one who thinks being responsible really
sucks sometimes?&quot; the slayer asked rhetorically.</p>

<p>She got an answer even though she wasn't really asking for one.
&quot;Uh huh.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy took a deep breath, uncertain how much that was going to help
when the sweet musk of perfume mixed with human arousal touched her nostrils. She let her
breath out slowly, feeling Willow shudder in response to the soft rush of warm air.
&quot;This isn't working,&quot; she groaned and pushed upright. Willow's blouse and bra
were spread open, revealing her bare chest and her skirt was crumpled high on her thighs,
while Buffy's own clothes hung askew, the front buttons on her blouse open, allowing the
tails to dangle free on either side of her breasts. She quickly dragged them back
together, though her hands were shaking too hard to even have a prayer of refastening the
buttons. Holding the front of her blouse together, she reached down and tugged Willow's
shirt front back together, hiding soft curves. Much better. &quot;We need to take this
slowly,&quot; she panted raggedly.</p>

<p>Willow nodded again and reached up to run a hand through her
thoroughly mussed hair. &quot;Slowly,&quot; she parroted.</p>

<p>Buffy stumbled to her feet, staggering ever so slightly as she stood
and took a step back. There were a lot of complications to this relationship, not the
least of which were the obvious gender issues, the fact that they were both seeing other
people and the fact that her last lover had been a vampire who tried to slaughter everyone
she knew. Not even Melrose Place had to deal with that one. Willow pushed up on her hands,
the movement sending her blouse spilling away from her breasts again. Buffy felt her pulse
pick back up&#133;and just when she'd been starting to get it under control. She made a
small gesture with one hand. &quot;Umm&#133;could you?&quot;</p>

<p>Willow dragged the sides of her blouse back together. Responsible.
That's right, they were responsible. &quot;Maybe, we should&#133;uh&#133;try and get some
studying done,&quot; she suggested. After all, sensual discoveries aside, they still had
that test, and Buffy still needed some help if she was going to avoid flunking.</p>

<p>Buffy blinked. That wasn't what she'd expected to hear. On the other
hand, it wasn't such a bad suggestion. Studying might just cool down some of the
overheated hormones in the room without forcing them to call a halt to the evening.
Something the slayer was in no hurry to do. She nodded shakily, already struggling to
straighten her disarrayed clothes. &quot;Yeah&#133;.that would probably
be&#133;best.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow fumbled with her own clothes, straightening them and trying
to restore some measure of sanity as she felt her pulse slow to something vaguely
approaching normal. Finished, she looked up again, noting that Buffy also seemed to have
gotten herself under control. &quot;Did this happen?&quot; she questioned suddenly, afraid
that it was just a hormone induced bit of frenzy for her friend; that it would be buried
and forgotten.</p>

<p>Buffy reached out, brushing her fingers over pink lips. &quot;It
happened,&quot; she assured her friend. She stepped close, standing toe to toe. &quot;And
I want it to happen again&#133;but we need to take time&#133;be careful.&quot; She dropped
the smallest of kisses on soft kips. &quot;I don't want to screw up our friendship.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow nodded. &quot;Right&#133;time&#133;careful&#133;no screwing
up.&quot; She took a deep breath, let it out on a five count as she straightened her
shoulders. Better, she was handling it now, though there was still a vibrating awareness
in the air. It would be so easy...no...Buffy was right...slow....</p>

<p>Willow consciously turned her gaze to the stack of textbook.
&quot;Study,&quot; she exhaled, her voice only a little higher pitched than normal.</p>

<p>Buffy nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;I think we were on page two hundred and thirty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right&#133;two-thirty&#133;&quot;</p>

<p>They sat, consciously focusing on the books, words, and dry facts
contained within&#133;and if they sat a little closer than normal, or found more reasons
than usual for their bodies to make the tiniest of contacts, it didn't stop them from
getting through the chapter. And as they finally started to close up the session, Buffy
started to throw the empty coke bottle away, only to change her mind. She set it on her
nightstand; a small token of the discoveries they'd made that night&#133;.</p>
