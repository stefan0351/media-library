<!-- Whither Thou Goest \ Chapter Thirteen -->

<P><I>Nanking, China-- 1842 -- The Last Days of the Heavenly Middle Kingdom</P>
</I></B><I>
<P>Outside the darkness of the rented crib, the world was coming to an end; greedy men destroying underarmed soldiers led by corrupted generals, while a hopelessly addicted populace looked on in helpless horror. Inside the small room none of it mattered to the girl who carefully cooked a small ball of white material, her hands trembling only slightly with nervous tension. She was perhaps fifteen, with gentle features, her long dark hair glossy where it hung down her slender back. Despite her youth, she'd done this a thousand different times for a thousand different men. Such was he fate of a peasant girl sold into slavery by a family with too many daughters and too few sons. As she finished preparing the opium, she looked up from under thick lashes at the woman who stood in the shadows a few feet away, tamping down her instinctive fear. She'd dealt with a thousand men, but this was the first woman...and the first person in the combination whorehouse and opium den to treat her with anything approaching kindness.</P>
<P>&quot;It is ready,&quot; she said softly, her lower-class Cantonese accent dulling the high vowels of her Mandarin, marking her for a peasant to anyone with the ear to hear the differences in the dialects. She started to repeat the words in achingly learned English--almost none of the foreign savages spoke even the most common dialects--but the woman only waved her silent, responding in softly accented Mandarin that very nearly mastered the lyrical quality of the language.</P>
<P>&quot;It's yours,&quot; she said gently.</P>
<P>The girl frowned, not quite understanding. She was an addict of course, like a horrifying percentage of her fellow countrymen, but with war raging around them, the prices were rising on the drug imported from the poppy fields of India. For a foreigner, even a rich one, to give such a thing to a prostitute was unheard of. Fear glittered in her eyes alongside a perverse sort of gratitude as she stared at the westerner. At some level, she knew the kindness was no kindness and that it would cost her, but she was no more able to resist the siren's song than any other addicted child with no comfort but the drug they've learned to both love and hate.</P>
<P>She inhaled deeply from the pipe, shuddering ever so slightly as she felt the first wave of numbing haze wash over her. She inhaled again and felt the familiar pull of the sky as gravity released her body from the earth.</P>
<P>Soft hands cupped her face, then slid down the graceful length of her neck before parting the front of her gown, while lips as fine as the Emperor's silk delicately teased her mouth. She'd heard of men wanting women to perform such perversities for their pleasure, but it had never occurred to her that they might do such things for their own pleasure. Another lungful of smoke had her floating, clinging to the arms that held her and arching against the caressing lips that slid down and over her bared torso.</P>
<P>Such sweet pleasure; almost as addictive as the thick narcotic smoke making its way through her bloodstream. She cried out, nails digging into her strange lover's shoulders, body trembling with need, confused by the alien pleasure rippling through her nerve endings, but helpless to resist them. And when lips and fingers touched all the places in her body she'd learned to hate, she sobbed with pleasure for the first time in her young life.</P>
<P>Fingers digging into silky blond hair, she held on tightly as her lover slid back up the length of her body, begging and praying for the beauty to last the rest of her life.</P>
<P>&quot;It will...I promise....&quot; The softly accented voice wrapped around her, soothing any fears.</P>
<P>And then sharp teeth tore into the soft flesh of her throat.</P>
<P>Pleasure and pain coalesced into one entity as the girl experienced the first and last orgasm of her pain-filled life, dying far more sweetly than she'd lived.</P>
<P>Powerful hands slid through fine black silk hair as the vampire drank deeply from the peasant girl's throat, the thick narcotic of her blood flowing through long-dead veins, until the figure in her arms was little more than a dried out husk. She rose slowly, the girl's body still draped across her forearm, and wavered on suddenly unsteady feet as the familiar feeling of the drug washed through her. She tipped her head back, eyes sliding closed as she felt her body grow lighter with every passing second. At times like this, with the hunger sated and the mind dulled, the beast could almost forget the agony of its existence. Still holding the dead child like a cherished lover, it awaited the familiar brush of pleasurable nothingness.</P>
<P>But then instead of the familiar pleasure, there was pain, agonizing, bitter pain. She screamed, green eyes snapping open and clumsily threw an arm across her face, roaring as sunlight poured across her face. She dodged into the shadows, snarling in hate, but another hole appeared in the ceiling blocking off that escape route, knocked in the slat and plaster by a heavy sledge hammer. She tried to duck again, and again a hole was drilled from above to allow sunlight through, forming a cage of light around the roaring, raging beast.</P>
<P>She spun unsteadily as the door to the crypt-like interior of the crib was pushed open, lips drawing back from sharp canines in a feral snarl.</P>
<P>The men who entered were well-armed, and they quickly spread out, ready to deal with any resistance she might offer. &quot;Who dares?&quot; she growled in barely comprehensible Mandarin.</P>
<P>The response came in an ear-piercing wail in a language she didn't recognize, though with hundreds of dialects on the Chinese continent, that wasn't that unusual. The priests entered then, Shaolin, Shinto, Taoist, and a Buddhist monk, all praying, their whining drone painful to her ears.</P>
<P>&quot;Hitting all the low points,&quot; she sneered, panic and inebriation driving her to slip into her native French, while the world tipped back and forth beneath her feet, threatening to toss her to the floor. And what an embarrassing way to die that would be. They lit incense wrapped in paper covered with delicately written prayers and pleadings to long dead ancestors, chanting and praying, while she snarled and tried to lunge forward, only to be forced back by the sharp beams of sunlight cutting through the smoky air.</P>
<P>And then the soldiers parted, making way for the slender figure that entered between them, her carriage erect and graceful, her gold silk robe embroidered in entwined patterns of dragons, and phoenixes, with black cuffs edged by images of bats and clouds.</P>
<P>The demon's eyes lifted, meeting the newcomer's black gaze and nearly losing herself in the obsidian depths. The Chinese woman was young and beautiful, her black hair swept back from smooth features, but the vampire cared nothing for that, only for the threat she sensed in her cool confidence. Uncertain now, she bared her teeth like any cornered animal.</P>
<P>A wry smile twisted strawberry kissed lips and the Chinese woman spoke with the clear and perfect accent befitting any member of the Emperor's court. &quot;Did you think the sacred ancestors of my people would simply allow you to slaughter at will, beast?&quot;</P>
<P>The creature allowed herself a small sneer, reminding herself of her essential superiority. &quot;Since they haven't seen fit to do much to stop the British from killing far more than I ever thought of, I don't suppose I ever considered the problem.&quot;</P>
<P>Black eyes narrowed and the woman straightened if struck. &quot;Such arrogance from a thing that cannot have the one thing it desires.&quot;</P>
<P>Hatred glittered in the creature's eyes for the truth behind the words. &quot;You know nothing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is you who know nothing. You could steal the artist's hands, but not the heart, her eyes, but not her soul. All of the alcohol and opium in the universe will <B>never </B>change that.&quot;</P>
<P>The creature roared in fury then, all control lost, lunging for her throat, then fell back screaming as a priest flicked yellow silk in her path, and it touched her skin, licking burns across her flesh like the caress of a Christian cross.</P>
<P>&quot;Faith controls you. Faith can destroy you....&quot;</P>
<P>She fell back, gagging and clawing at her face and arms as the smoke from the burning incense touched her skin. Above her, wooden javelins were ready to thrust down through the holes in the ceiling and send her back to dust. &quot;Do it,&quot; she growled, almost welcoming the death to come. Too long had she lingered in this mortal world, unable to touch the one thing she had come for. Leaving would be a kind of peace. &quot;End it.&quot; She fell to the dirt floor, an arm still around the dead prostitute, slender fingers clawing into the cool earth as she tried to escape the burning fingers of their faith floating around her.</P>
<P>&quot;Or faith can create you,&quot; a soft voice whispered near her ear, the tone silky, promising a kind of peace she had no right to. &quot;Surrender to me, and I can show you how to attain the one thing you long for.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Meat puppet, you can show me nothing,&quot; she snarled, and suddenly found herself face to face with the dead child. A trembling hand lifted to brush soft hair from the delicate face. &quot;I was made before your world was even a flickering ball of matter in the heavens. What can mere mortal flesh ever show me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You sought to become <B>mere</B> mortal flesh. <B>Mere</B> mortal flesh can create a painting with a soul...while you can create nothing more than a dead likeness on canvas.&quot;</P>
<P>The vampire roared, a feral sound that echoed off the walls, but didn't look up to face her enemy.</P>
<P>A hand dug into her hair, dragging her head back when she would have fought. &quot;I know what you are,&quot; her tormentor hissed. &quot;What you have been...and what you can become...I can give you what you long for...but only if you surrender to me.&quot;</P>
<P>A long moment passed, the air thick with smoke; silent, except for the occasional rustle of bamboo armor. The vampire had no fear of death. Whether it was an ending or simply a return to the Abyss, she didn't know, but either way, it was barely mattered. Nothing had mattered for more millennia than she cared to count. Her very existence was cursed by God. Perhaps that meant that nothing at all mattered in the end.</P>
<P>And yet, there stood her strange captor, holding out the promise of some measure of peace...some small bit of fulfillment.</P>
<P>Or a swift death.</P>
<P>It wasn't such a hard choice in the end.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; she whispered after another beat. Almost instantly, the hold on her hair gentled, becoming almost tender, rewarding her for her submission.</P>
<P>&quot;And it begins.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What begins?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Everything....&quot;</I></P>
<P>The sweet voice muted and melded into another, speaking English now as Delaine struggled up through the enveloping haze surrounding her.</P>
<P>&quot;...eyes rolled back in her head and she just pitched forward.&quot; It was the old Chinese woman's voice...sort of--but not exactly-- because her English perfect and unaccented now.</P>
<P>A hand landed on her upper arm, breaking in on her addled musing. &quot;Miss?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Damn junkies, you'd think they could find somebody else's place of business to die in.&quot;</P>
<P>She blinked back to full consciousness, suddenly becoming aware of the feel of cold cement under her cheek.</P>
<P>&quot;Better call this one in.&quot; A cop, and then she heard the staticky sound of a radio.</P>
<P>&quot;No, it's...it's all right,&quot; she mumbled and pushed upright, staring around herself in confusion as she realized she was on the floor of the Chinese woman's tiny shop, though the trigrams of the <I>I-Ching</I> were no longer in evidence. An officer, younger and less jaded looking than most, was crouched down next to her, his expression worried. &quot;I...I just slipped and fell.&quot; She reached up and massaged her temple as if it throbbed, trying not to tremble in the aftermath of the visions despite their probable meaning. &quot;Must have hit my head.&quot;</P>
<P>The cop's eyes lifted to the fortune teller. &quot;Really?&quot; he questioned. &quot;She said you mumbled something and passed out.&quot;</P>
<P>Green eyes lifted, finding the fortune teller, and then she blinked in momentary surprise. This one was younger--a lot younger--and the scrying stone was gone, though the gaudy jewelry remained. Her hair was cut short and modern, the Suzy Wong sheath dress made taut by overfull curves, while the embroidery was still expansive, but with the machine-styled perfection of mass production. &quot;No,&quot; she said softly, leaning on the hand he offered as she climbed to her feet. He had the look of a man protective of women and she flashed an appreciative smile. &quot;Just slipped and fell.&quot;</P>
<P>His eyes turned suspiciously toward the fortune teller. They'd had complaints before.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm fine...really. She was facing the other way when it happened. Probably didn't realize what happened.&quot; She heard her own voice, sounding confident despite the quavering in her stomach.</P>
<P>The fortune teller was scared now. She already had enough trouble keeping her business license. The last thing she needed was some hotheaded young cop deciding she'd endangered a customer. &quot;Yeah...I guess I just didn't see as much as I thought.&quot;</P>
<P>The vampire heard her own voice, her normally almost nonexistent French accent far more pronounced than usual as she assured him, &quot;Really, I'm fine. It was just a little accident.&quot; She straightened her coat, trying to look more respectable than the form-fitting leather she was wearing under the trenchcoat would have indicated. &quot;I-I need to go.&quot;</P>
<P>The officer's hand caught her back. He still wasn't convinced what had happened. &quot;Maybe you should go to the hospital.&quot; She tried to pull her arm back, but he insisted on holding on.</P>
<P>In that instant, she almost killed him, almost turned back and devoured him before he knew what hit him. &quot;No,&quot; she gasped instead and yanked her arm loose to flee into the night. She turned herself free then, letting go all of the self-control she maintained to maneuver unseen and unnoticed among humans, moving as only she could, fast and high, dancing along rooftops and treelimbs with the ease and grace of a wraith. In the distance, she could hear the officer calling after her, but he was long gone and she simply was what she was.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</P>
<P>Buffy did a slow pivot in the interior of her mother's shop, willing her heart to slow its hammering beat against the inside of her ribcage. She drew a deep breath and exhaled heavily in a futile attempt to release the stress gathered in the pit of her stomach.</P>
<P>&quot;You're ready,&quot; she whispered to herself. &quot;You can do this.&quot; She fisted her hands at her sides, silently reviewing where she'd stashed the weapons. As she ran through the mental checklist, she tried not to think of Willow and the way she'd been forced to leave her.</P>
<I>
<P>No, best not to think about that</I>. Willow would be okay. She would see to it even if it cost her everything.</P>
<P>There was no way in hell she was going to let any goddamn demon--ex-Slayer, or not--hurt the woman she-- <I>the people</I>-- she loved, she silently amended.</P>
<P>She was ready. She was prepared. She was psyched.</P>
<P>And hopefully, she <I>wasn't</I> doomed.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</P>
<P>Tara stood outside Willow's dorm room, her expression a mixture of guilt and uncertainty. She couldn't believe what she was contemplating doing; sneaking into the pretty redhead's room just to see where she lived, and perhaps feel a little closer to her, even if only for a brief moment. She'd known from the first brief meeting at the Wiccan gathering that the other girl was special, sensing the power hiding just beneath her quiet surface, but she'd held back, too shy to do more than introduce herself--and barely able to even do that much--thrilled to simply be in the other girl's presence. When she'd heard that Willow had been caught in the violence at the Twenty-Four/Seven, she'd almost passed out with sheer terror. Tara had it bad and she knew she had it bad.</P>
<P>Which was why she was standing outside the other girl's dorm room, striving to ignore the bad music blasting from the rooms up and down the hall, slipping the key into the lock, and trying desperately to pretend she was just doing this for the sake of Willow's fish. After all, while they might like the punk music Buffy had left playing (being fish, they probably didn't have the most highly developed music taste in the world), but even the most forgiving of fishy tastes couldn't be enjoying the cacophony that was blaring through the building until the foundations were probably starting to crumble.</P>
<P>Okay, so even Tara wasn't buying that mental argument, but it was all she had, so she clung to it fervently as she turned the key, and pushed the door open. She stepped through quickly--the flickering fear of being caught in the potentially embarrassing, if not exactly compromising position adding speed to her movements--turned, pausing momentarily as her eyes adjusted to the relative darkness of the room.</P>
<P>And froze, mouth dropping open as she stared at the scene before her in abject horror. &quot;Oh, my God...Willow...&quot; she exhaled and rushed forward, reaching for the cuffs latched over Willow's head.</P>
<P>The redhead shook her head violently, shouting hoarsely to make herself heard above the music. &quot;THE KEYS ARE IN THE TOP DESK DRAWER!&quot; She'd begun her captivity by straining against the handcuffs, but after it quickly became apparent that technique was doomed to failure, she'd calmed herself and worked on levitating the drawer open, something she'd managed with relative ease. Unfortunately, the iron in the steel alloy keys had proven as resistant to magical powers as the legends said, and they had sat unmoving in the open drawer despite her best efforts.</P>
<P>Unable to quickly spot the volume control on the radio, Tara yanked the cord out of the wall, lowering the sound level in the room to a dull, undirected roar, then scrambled after the keys. &quot;What happened?&quot; she stammered quickly. &quot;We should call the police...my God, are you hurt?&quot; Her hands were shaking so badly, she could barely get the key in the handcuff lock and finally, Willow took over, freeing herself. Tara pushed to her feet, adrenaline making her jittery. &quot;We've got to call 911.&quot; And then her eyes darted around the room, shoulders straightening as she summoned something deep inside herself. &quot;Is there any chance whoever did this is still here?&quot; The questions came so fast and furious, stuttery though they were, that Willow had no chance to answer until that point.</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; Willow said sharply, her tone forestalling Tara's move toward the phone. &quot;It's not what you think. It wasn't an...intruder...it was Buffy....&quot;</P>
<P>Tara's eyes went wide. &quot;You...your roommate?&quot;</P>
<P>Forcing Willow to quickly amend, &quot;It's not like <I>that</I> either. She did it to protect me--the boneheaded idiot.&quot; Tara was still staring at her like she'd lost her mind as Willow tossed the cuffs aside and leaned down to free her ankles. Luckily, those restraints were just latched with velcro, so she was free in moments. &quot;It's complicated.&quot; The hacker pushed to her feet, grabbing for the phone and dialing as she snagged her shoes and socks and began yanking them on.</P>
<P>&quot;Um...what are you...&quot; Tara stuttered uneasily. &quot;W-Willow--&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Really complicated,&quot; Willow added, then muttered to herself, &quot;Dammit, Giles, pick up.&quot; Finally, when it was clear no one was going to answer, she slammed the phone down, finished tying off her track shoes, and scrambled first to the closet where she grabbed a lightweight jacket of the Slayer's that was blessed with a myriad of pockets, then over to the bed. &quot;I'm sorry, but I don't have time to explain.&quot; She yanked Buffy's weapon's box out from under the bed, grabbing for a crossbow pistol the Slayer had apparently deemed too small to be effective. She grabbed a handful of short wooden bolts and shoved them in her pocket, then reached for the couple of stakes still remaining in the box. They were less than ideally sharp, but all that she had. Willow looked up as she heard Tara's soft gasp.</P>
<P>&quot;Vampires,&quot; the blond exhaled heavily, her expressive eyes going wide with fright.</P>
<P>Willow stared at the other girl in shock. &quot;You know?&quot; she breathed.</P>
<P>&quot;I-I've heard rumors...but...I never...I...y-you can't go out there if--&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't have a choice,&quot; Willow said as she rose again. &quot;I can't let Buffy face her alone.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;H-her? I don't understand.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I know and I don't have time to explain.&quot; Willow grabbed a sheet of scratch-paper off the desk, quickly scrawling a phone number across the top. &quot;But I need you to do me a favor.&quot; She turned a pleading look Tara's way and the blond felt her heart melt even as she realized that any fantasies she had about Willow were doomed to remain nothing more than fantasies. The hacker was in love--real love--it burned in her aura like a living flame.</P>
<P>&quot;A-anything,&quot; Tara whispered.</P>
<P>&quot;Thanks...&quot; Willow jotted a couple of words on the paper, then handed it to Tara. &quot;I need you to keep trying this number. If someone picks up, ask for Giles, tell him that Buffy has gone to Joyce's gallery to face DuCourvallier. He needs to come loaded for bear. Same message if he calls here. 'Kay?&quot;</P>
<P>Tara nodded. &quot;I'll tell him,&quot; she promised. &quot;But, Willow--&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have to go now,&quot; the hacker said as she pocketed her keys and headed toward the door.</P>
<P>&quot;Willow,&quot; Tara spoke sharply, her voice edged in desperation.</P>
<P>The hacker turned back.</P>
<P>&quot;Be careful.&quot;</P>
<P>A hint of a smile graced Willow's lips. &quot;If I were careful, I probably wouldn't be going...but thanks.&quot; And then she slipped out, pulling the door closed in her wake, and leaving Tara alone in the darkened room.</P>
<P>&quot;Gaia, protect them,&quot; the girl whispered, then picked up the phone and began dialing.</P>
