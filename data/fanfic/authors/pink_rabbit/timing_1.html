<!-- It All Depends On Your Timing \ Prologue -->

<p>The beast was a beastly sort of beast, the kind of thing that
usually only appeared in the worst nightmares of the very young, or the very mad; all
horns and scales, and gold and crimson flesh, standing taller than a man, but slightly
stooped, its massive knuckles not quite dragging the ground.</p>

<p>Even Spike found himself mildly nauseated, and he'd taken his
girlfriend back after she kissed a chaos demon, and they were bloody ugly things. He was
already beginning to wonder if this particular bit of fun Dru had arranged was such a good
idea when a massive hand clamped down on his shoulder, nearly shattering the bones into
several much smaller pieces. His eyes lifted, then his head tilted back on his neck until
his gaze met the creatures' slitted reptilian eyes. God, there were some days he was
tempted to avoid his fellow hellborne types altogether...especially if they were going to
insist on looking like this one.</p>

<p>Heavy lips curved upward into a grotesque mockery of a smile,
revealing jagged, broken teeth. &quot;So, what's up, pretty boy?&quot; the creature
boomed, its breath nearly knocking Spike off his feet.</p>

<p>God, was decent hygiene completely against the demons' code of
conduct? Spike straightened his immaculately groomed hair and resettled his expensive
leather jacket. Pretty boy indeed. Didn't this creature realize what kind of fierce demon
he was. &quot;The staff of Eldrad,&quot; he snapped impatiently. &quot;We've summoned you
to help retrieve the staff of Eldrad during the Festival of
Nagortathislaugenilfbaum.&quot;</p>

<p>The creature laughed, the sound echoing across the night. &quot;So,
where's the chicks? Can't have a festival without at least one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right...chicks...&quot; Spike exhaled and flashed a look of
distaste at Dru, who, true to form, never noticed. She was too busy making up nursery
rhymes featuring the words &quot;bludgeon&quot; and &quot;decapitate&quot;</p>
<i>

<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;There was an old man bludgeoned his wife,<br>
  Loving his supper with red guts and strife,<br>
  There was so much blood he didn't know what to do,<br>
  So he decapitated her head and hid it in the loo.&quot;</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spike sighed softly. Well, at least she had a hobby. His attention
returned to the black-horned beast as a few more shoulder bones were shattered in the name
of demonly camaraderie.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; the beast demanded, his breath wilting even
Drusilla's dead roses. &quot;let's go. Man, I ain't had me a virgin in a
loooooonnnnnngggggg time.&quot;</p>

<p>Spike looked up, openly startled. A virgin? Drusilla hadn't
mentioned that part when she planned this little gig. Bloody hell, where was he supposed
to dig up a virgin in bloody Sunnydale, when the only thing the wankers had to do in this
town after dark was have sex--well, that, and get killed by vampires--but mostly, they
just had sex. He paused, dedicating all of his brainpower to the project. It was
admittedly somewhat slow going. Suddenly, he grinned. He had an idea. A definite glimmer
of a good one. He knew just the right person.</p>
