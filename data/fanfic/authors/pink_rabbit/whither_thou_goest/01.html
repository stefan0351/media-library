<P><i>1615, Oxford, England</i></P>

<P>She was a slight figure, short of stature, slender, her once long blond hair
hacked short like a new penitent, her gown ripped and torn by rough hands and
the lash. Her arms had been twisted behind her and folded over a heavy wooden
pike pole, her slender wrists chained together in front. Strangely, the
heartrending sight softened no hearts amongst her captors. They understood the
need to make certain this one small girl could not resist her torments if they
were to have any hope at controlling her. Even bound and beaten, she faced them
proudly, standing gracefully in the center of the pit, the bars overhead casting
striped shadows across her slender frame. Despite her situation, pale green eyes
blazed with raw rage and she showed no sign of fearing their control over her
fate.</P>
<P>"You have been accused of betraying the Council, Slayer!" the
senior Watcher serving as magistrate over the proceedings charged, his voice
more than loud enough to be heard by the small crowd spread around the edges of
the pit. His heavy garb was ecclesiastical in appearance as befitted his
position within the ancient organization. The dark robes, trimmed in royal
purple and thick fur moved with his broad gestures, making him seem larger than
life.</P>
<P>The girl lunged forward, though there was nowhere for her to go. The pit and
chains binding her wrists were more than enough to contain any efforts she might
have made to escape. "I've betrayed no one!" she snarled. "It's
your precious Watcher who betrayed me!"</P>
<P>"Lying bitch!" a heavyset man standing near the judge screamed.
"She murdered Elizabeth! Tricked her--"</P>
<P>"LIAR!!" the girl screamed back. "I LOVED HER!!!"</P>
<P>"SILENCE!!!" the judge bellowed, then waved to the guards who stood
on the edges of the pit. "Judgment has been passed." The sound of
metal sliding on metal screamed through the caverns as metal barred doors were
pulled up, opening the corridors to the cells hidden deep inside the caverns.
"Your perversity and your treason <I>will</I> be punished!"</P>
<P>The vampires that began to flow from the newly opened corridors were half
starved, bony and thin, their faces warped by the desperate demons that lived
inside their dead flesh.</P>
<P>Had her situation not been so desperate, the girl might have felt some pity
for them. Even for the undead she'd shown an oddly soft heart, but as it was,
terror made her heart hammer in her chest as she saw doom careening toward her.
There were more than a dozen of the creatures all driven to a frenzy by
starvation.</P>
<P>She was a Slayer; inhumanly strong, unbelievably fast, trained to fight--and
to kill--and she used every skill beaten into her in the four years since she'd
learned of her perverse calling to the utmost of her ability. Of all her
captors, only one--a guard only a year or two older than her twenty years--had
done her even the smallest of favors. The pole used to brace her arms back was
wood and not steel and she wielded the makeshift weapon with a skill borne of
desperation.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, her abilities weren't likely to save her. Only God could do
that--at least that was the idea of the trial by combat--and even he would have
been hard pressed to rescue the desperately battling young woman.</P>
<P>Overhead, gasps could be heard amongst the assembled crowd, along with the
odd sound of a bet being made. The odds were not in the prisoner's favor,
especially when she was momentarily overwhelmed by the thick--but
thinning--horde of her attackers.</P>
<P>But as they watched, more than a few council members could almost believe
that God<I> had</I> smiled on this Slayer. Despite being chained, outnumbered,
and beaten bloody, she fought like a lion, killing creature after creature as
they came after her, using her skills, and the clumsy weapon to dispatch them
back to hell.</P>
<P>Clouds of inhuman dust rose from the battle, obscuring their view and the
audience leaned farther forward in their seats, peering through the bars, trying
to find the slight figure of the young Slayer through the haze of vampire dust
with only flickering torchlight to aid them. Screams echoed across the hall and
more bets were made, the odds shifting with every passing moment.</P>
<P>And then it all fell silent.</P>
<P>Breaths caught and the sound of voices died away, until the only remaining
noise was the occasional jingle of coins being readied to trade hands.</P>
<P>Thick vampire dust slowly settled, the torches casting unsteady light through
the hanging haze, until finally a silhouetted figure could be seen.</P>
<P>A collective gasp went through the audience of Watchers as their victim was
revealed to their avid eyes.</P>
<P>The Slayer stood alone, her head bowed as blood streamed from a dozen small
wounds. Her wrists were slick with crimson, and as they watched, she slowly
worked one free of a manacle, drawing more blood and scraping the flesh of her
already battered hand. The chain fell away with a startling clank, but she only
lifted her arm from its braced position where it had been wrapped around the
pole, then slowly straightened it, working tortured fingers with careful
precision.</P>
<P>From his place on the mezzanine, the magistrate gestured to the guards
positioned around the pit and crossbows were raised, the bolts sighted on the
slender figure below.</P>
<P>If she was aware of this latest form of stalking death, she showed no outward
sign.</P>
<P>The members of the Watcher's Council all stared at the girl in mesmerized
awe, hardly able to believe that the doomed Slayer had survived. Scarcely a one
of them could even draw breath as they watched their prisoner pull the pole
across her back free and drop it to the dirt before methodically beginning the
process of removing the remaining manacle.</P>
<P>No one knew quite how to respond when she began to sing, the sweet sounds of
a madrigal--a sad tale of lost love--slipping from her lips to float up through
the chamber.</P>
<P>"She's mad," someone murmured somewhere in the crowd, and more than
a few who overheard the comment nodded in agreement. Not surprising, really,
considering what she'd been through. It would be a sad loss, they all agreed,
but not unpredictable. Unfortunate as it was, she would have to be dealt with.
The world could not do without a Slayer. At least this way she could be buried
in consecrated ground.</P>
<P>And then her wrist slipped free of the rough-edged metal and the chains fell
to the dirt with only the faintest jingle as the links tumbled into each other.
For a long moment, she just stood there, her head still down. Of course, it was
a wonder she was still on her feet at all.</P>
<P>As if driven by the very silence and stillness of the girl, her former
Watcher suddenly lunged forward, his portly frame, ungraceful at the best of
times, trembling with uncontrolled rage and something else--fear. She had passed
the test. That possibility had never occurred to him. "Destroy her!"
he screamed, his voice threatening to crack with panic. After all, he had
brought the full weight of the Council's judgment down on her narrow shoulders,
and it was no secret that an angry Slayer was a dangerous Slayer.</P>
<P>"Silence!" the Magistrate bellowed, still watching the girl with
intense eyes. "Tell the Council, child, have you been adjudged innocent of
the charges?"</P>
<P>She toed the wooden pole lying at her feet, flicking one end upward to catch
it easily. Still singing, her voice clear and sweet, she slowly began to roll it
between her fingers then over the back of her knuckles, her pace leisurely.</P>
<P>More voices mumbled about her obvious insanity.</P>
<P>And then pale green eyes lifted from under thick lashes and a smile lifted
full lips. Narrow shoulders shook with soft laughter, and then suddenly the
girl's chin slowly lifted, the song trailing off as she drew breath to respond.
"Not exactly," she drawled as the blood running down the graceful arch
of her throat was revealed to the watching crowd. In an instant, while her
audience was paralyzed with shock, she hurled the pole like a javelin, sending
it straight through the magistrate's heart in one fell swoop.</P>
<P>Crossbow bolts were fired, but none reached her heart as she plucked them out
of the air with fine boned hands and flung them back at the guards, easily
piercing the thin armored chestplates they wore and then the hearts beneath.</P>
<P>As panic reigned, she easily broke through the slatted wooden bars meant to
keep her in the pit. They were designed to contain vampire strength, or Slayer
strength, but not Vampire-Slayer strength.</P>
<P>And then the killing began in earnest....</P>
<P>The slaughter took no more than an hour as she moved through the caverns with
demonic precision, leaving the hand hewn walls and carved stone floors drenched
in blood and littered with body parts. She turned no one, instead tearing them
to pieces with a brutally efficient ferocity borne of both training and inherent
skill. The demon inside wanted nothing left of her earthly predecessor's
tormentors.</P>
<P>At last, she stood in the storage room where the remnants of her life had
been gathered and used as evidence against her during the trial, careless of the
dead left in her wake, physically sated, but.... She stood before the paintings
stacked against one wall, reached out, touched the top one, pulled it forward to
study the ones behind it one at a time, and finally curved fine boned fingers to
the entire stack. As she left the storage room, the paintings in hand, she
spared a glance for her former Watcher where he hung impaled on the spikes of a
large free-standing candelabra. His screams had provided the soundtrack for much
of her killing spree, though he'd finally fallen silent. She paused when she
stood before him, eyeing his florid, blood spattered face. "Poor
Freddy," she drawled and reached out to trail a finger through the crimson
streamers on his face. "Your nasty little bit of revenge didn't quite work
out the way you planned, now did it." She tasted the blood on her fingertip
and made a face. "You really should have cut back on the alcohol my
friend." Then, laughing, she turned from her former tormentor and walked
away into the night.</P>

<P>Willow was crying again, not deep wrenching sobs, but soft, almost soundless
tears that seemed to go on forever. Just in from patrol, Buffy silently peeled
off her jacket and put away her weapons bag, painfully aware of the tiny sounds
as she tried to tamp down a wave of nagging guilt. She knew she was doing a
sucky job as a best friend. With camouflage commandos running around campus,
Spike living in Gile's bathtub, plus school, semi-dating Riley or at least being
pursued by and considering semi-dating Riley, and of course her usual vampire
killing duties, she just hadn't had time for doing the sort of
best-friend-helping-best-friend-get-over-guy-by-eating-too-much-chocolate-and-plotting-vengeance
sorts of activities -- Buffy sighed softly -- and maybe there'd been a bit of
avoidance mixed in there as well, she admitted in a darkness inspired flash of
discomfiting honesty. That whole Cro-Magnon necking experience had thrown her
equilibrium more than she cared to admit, not just because she'd enjoyed it, but
because as much as she'd pursued Parker and now Riley during the day, it was
Willow she seemed to be dreaming about at night--starting shortly after Angel's
exit from Sunnydale, and seemingly growing in intensity with every passing
night--strange dreams full of tenderness and sensuality that left her panting
and painfully aware of her own body when she woke. It was all just a little too
confusing--and now that Oz was gone from Willow's life --at least
temporarily--maybe just a little too tempting.</P>
<B><I>
<P>Sniff.</P>
</I></B>
<P>The soft sound reminded Buffy of just where her line of thought had begun. <I>That's
good, Buffy</I>, she castigated herself, <I>can you get any more self-centered?</I>
<I>Willow's hurting, and are you thinking about her? No, you're worrying about
yourself. And after all the times she's done the sympathize-over-the-boyfriend
thing for you. If you can manage to be just a little <B>more</B> sympathetic,
maybe she won't turn down that whole Vengeance Demon gig next time.</P>
</I><B><I>
<P>Sniff.</P>
</I></B>
<P>"Hey, Will," the Slayer said very softly as she drew close to the
bed. The sniffles instantly stopped and she could almost hear Willow trying not
be heard crying. Buffy sighed softly again. Oh, she'd mouthed all the right
platitudes, but it suddenly bothered her that she hadn't spent nearly enough
time offering Willow the kind of unconditional support Willow had offered her
under similar circumstances. Hell, Spike had been more in tune with the fact
that she was walking on the edge. "I know you're awake," she added
gently and heard another soft sniff that made her heart clench with guilt. No
wonder Willow had nearly wound up bailing from the good guy's team.</P>
<P>"Maybe a little," a tiny voice admitted in the darkness.</P>
<P>Buffy silently took a seat on the edge of Willow's bed, startlingly aware of
the warmth of her friend's body where it nudged up against her hip. "I
just..." Buffy began hesitantly. "I wanted to talk to you." She
reached out, resting her hand lightly on Willow's hip, moving her thumb in a
gentle circular pattern.</P>
<P>"Oh," Willow exhaled in a tiny voice. "I guess you were out
slaying tonight."</P>
<P>"Yeah," Buffy said, her tone brushing the subject aside.
"Look, Will, I know things have been really difficult
lately...and...well...I just...some apologies are in order--"</P>
<P>"Buffy, I'm sorry," Willow apologized instantly. "I mean I'm
really sorry about that whole spell thing and causing you and Spike
to...well...kiss...and all that...I mean I really didn't know--"</P>
<P>"Shhh," Buffy hushed while Willow kept apologizing until the Slayer
laid her fingers lightly over her friend's lips. "That's not the apology I
was referring to."</P>
<P>"Oh," Willow murmured, then drew a sharp breath. "I'm sorry if
I haven't really been a lot of fun lately, and if the whole crying thing has
been keeping you up--"</P>
<P>"Will, don't," Buffy interrupted the ongoing apology, feeling worse
with every word Willow had said. God, she really hadn't been getting it right
lately. "I meant the apology I owe you."</P>
<P>Willow went completely still. "You owe me?" she repeated
doubtfully.</P>
<P>"Yeah," Buffy confirmed. "I haven't done a great job of being
a friend...since...well...lately." Buffy sighed tiredly, leaning forward,
her elbows braced on her knees, fingers loosely intertwined. "I dunno,"
she exhaled. "It's like I've been kind of out of control, not knowing
whether I was coming or going...I should have realized what a hard time you were
having...and been there for you..." She reached over and curved her fingers
around Willow's hand and swallowed hard. "You're the best friend I've ever
had...and I'm sorry I failed you. You shouldn't have been crying alone."</P>
<P>Willow sniffed back on her tears, blinked rapidly to clear her vision as she
peered up at the Slayer's shadowed profile. Slowly, she pushed upright, sitting
cross-legged, elbows braced on her knees. "Thanks," she whispered at
last. She'd entered college so confident, feeling like someone totally
different, but losing Oz had shaken her newfound collegiate composure. "I
just didn't want to be a burden...I've tried to...tried to cover things
up...but...."</P>
<P>"I know," Buffy sighed, remembering how that had turned out.
"And the whole covering up thing--well, in light of that whole vengeance
demon thing--maybe not such a good idea."</P>
<P>Willow turned her hand under Buffy's, clinging tightly and blinked rapidly,
trying to clear the hot tears stinging her eyes. "It's just that everything
seems wrong lately...not just Oz...everything...."</P>
<P>Buffy frowned ever so slightly. She knew the feeling. She 'd been feeling
increasingly disconnected for months and nothing seemed to fix it. At first
she'd attributed it to Angel's move to Los Angeles and tried to lose it in the
pursuit of other men, but more recently that explanation had seemed less and
less likely. Perhaps it was just the change from high school to college--<I>or
maybe it's those dreams you don't want to admit to</I>, a tiny voice whispered
in her ear, <I>the ones where you can't seem to keep your hands off your best
friend, where she's not just your best friend, but also your lover, your
partner, and the best thing that's ever happened in your life</I>. "That's
not it," Buffy hissed at the recalcitrant voice only to get an odd look
from Willow.</P>
<P>"Buff?"</P>
<P>"Sorry," the Slayer apologized hurriedly. "Just talking to
myself."</P>
<P>Willow nodded understandingly. She'd always tended to talk to herself and
lately that tendency had extended to long, unwanted conversations. She stared
down at her hands, studying the complicated network of bones, tendons and veins
as she avoided looking at the Slayer.</P>
<P>"Talk to me, Will," Buffy said after several long moments of
silence.</P>
<P>There were so many thoughts running through Willow's head in disjointed,
random pathways that she barely knew where to begin. "Do you think about
them?" she asked at last.</P>
<P>The question left Buffy confused and she stared at her friend, nonplused.
"Who?"</P>
<P>"The demons and vampires you've killed?" The hacker looked up, lost
in thought as she stared at a random point somewhere in the distance.</P>
<P>"Sometimes," Buffy admitted hesitantly, not wanting to admit that
sometimes she couldn't stop thinking about it. She knew they were demons, knew
she had no choice in what she did, but they looked human enough, had
personalities, sometimes even begged for their lives. Even knowing what she did,
it bothered her more often than she cared to admit.</P>
<P>"Because I can't stop thinking about Veruca," Willow whispered,
then shook her head, refocusing on Buffy. "I mean, she was our age....and
she's dead...and I--"</P>
<P>"What happened wasn't your fault, Will. She was going to kill you. If Oz
hadn't--"</P>
<P>"It's not just that," Willow cut her friend off, trying to find a
way to explain what she was feeling, the thoughts that had been running through
her head since that night. She took a deep breath, letting it out slowly in an
effort to clear her head. "She was human, Buffy...not dead and not a
demon--"</P>
<P>"She was a werewolf, Will," Buffy reminded her friend.</P>
<P>"And so's Oz, but he hasn't given way to the darkness. So why did she go
the way she did? What made the difference in her life?"</P>
<P>Buffy started to answer, but held her words back. True, Oz hadn't given in to
the wolf, but he was afraid of it, and she suspected there was a wildness there
that was never going away and might just be getting stronger. Oz would never
hurt any of them willingly, and she was quite certain that was one of the
reasons he'd left. He was afraid he couldn't control it much longer.
"No," she said at last.</P>
<P>"But he's afraid of it," Willow exhaled at last as if reading
Buffy's thoughts. She released her hold on Buffy's hand to let her head fall
forward into her palms.</P>
<P>"Will, if this is about Oz leaving--"</P>
<P>"It's not," the hacker denied and then looked up, her eyes damp
with tears. "I'm afraid of it too," she whispered raggedly.</P>
<P>Buffy stared at her friend in confusion. "Afraid of Oz?" she
questioned at last. Wolf or no wolf, she knew Oz would die before he'd hurt
Willow.</P>
<P>Willow shook her head, frustrated by Buffy's inability to understand what she
was saying. "No, of my own darkness."</P>
<P>The Slayer tensed, shaking her head in denial. "You don't have
any--" she began instantly.</P>
<P>"For God's sake, Buffy, I just got offered a job as a vengeance demon.
Clearly I have darkness issues."</P>
<P>Buffy opened her mouth to argue only to snap it shut again. Willow had a
point. "Okay," she murmured after a long beat, not knowing what else
to say.</P>
<P>Willow drew another deep breath and heaved a heavy sigh. "It's just that
I have this need to know more...to learn more about what I can do...but...but,
it's scary too sometimes...and sometimes..."</P>
<P>Buffy just kept listening to her friend, doing the one thing she hadn't had
time for amid her own needs and emergencies. She'd been there for Willow that
night--saving her life--but during the weeks since she'd been all too absent and
it was obvious there was a lot more going on here than she'd suspected. This
wasn't just the I-can't-get-over-the-boyfriend blues. It went a lot deeper. And
Willow clearly needed to get it off her chest.</P>
<P>The silence that lay between them wasn't the comfortable, friendly studying
together sort. It was more the uncomfortable,
how-in-the-hell-am-I-supposed-to-say-what-I'm-really-trying-to-say kind of
thing. Not simple even for the best of friends.</P>
<P>"I was casting a spell that night," Willow whispered at last,
swallowing back harsh tears to continue. "I just wanted him to hurt as much
as I did...I could feel it, Buffy--the power, the temptation. It was like it was
calling to me." The hacker shook her head slowly, shivering as she
remembered the sensation of dark energy coursing through her. "For a moment
I could almost understand Faith."</P>
<P>Buffy shivered as though someone had walked over her grave. "You could
never be like her, Will."</P>
<P>"Yes, I could," Willow disagreed. "I almost was...it was only
at the last moment that I couldn't...and then Veruca got there...and Oz..."
she trailed off, staring down at her hands with hypnotic intensity.</P>
<P>Buffy tried to find the words to offer comfort. "But you didn't do
it...you pulled back. We're all tempted sometimes--"</P>
<P>"But what happens if I <I>can't</I> pull back some day? I could hurt
someone, Buffy." She dragged slender fingers through sleep tousled hair.
"I dunno. Maybe I should just leave too...just go away where I can't hurt
anyone--"</P>
<P>"No!" Buffy snapped instantly, the very thought sending a bolt of
terror through her. Willow couldn't leave. That simply wasn't an option. She
caught Willow's hands in strong fingers, massaging them soothingly as she held
on tightly. "Don't talk like that," she insisted more calmly.
"You're not like Veruca <I>or</I> Faith...you have people who care for
you...who'll help you." Buffy had to resist the urge to lift those slender
hands and press soothing kisses across her knuckles the way she had in a
half-remembered dream. "You just have to trust us...let us help you." <I>And
by that</I>--that insistent part of brain clarified--<I>you mean let <B>me</B>
help you</I>. "But you have to be honest...you have to tell us...tell
me...when you need help." Buffy's gaze dropped to their twined hands to
hide the guilt she was feeling. "And if that means a two by four to my
thick skull...well...you do what you have to and play <I>'Whack a Slayer.'</I>"
The silence stretched out between them, while Buffy kept her head down, not
quite confident enough to look up and see Willow's expression.</P>
<P>"Oh...great..." the hacker drawled at last, a touch of humor
threading through her voice. "Are you trying to get me killed...<I>'Whack
the Slayer'</I> indeed..."</P>
<P>Buffy risked a glance at her friend, relaxing as she glimpsed a watery smile
lighting her gamine features.</P>
<P>"Though," the other girl continued, "as hard as your head is,
I'm not sure you'd notice."</P>
<P>Buffy chuckled at that. "Yeah," she agreed on a relieved sigh.
"It is pretty solid."</P>
<P>The mood broken, Willow reached out and mimed knocking her friend on the side
of the head. "Solid wood," she teased.</P>
<P>"Hey, that's a plus when you're the Slayer. How do you think I take out
all those vamps? I just head-butt 'em with my pointy, little, wooden head,"
Buffy defended with mock-indignation before turning serious once again. "I
mean it though, Will, the only way any of us get through life in Sunnyhell is by
sticking together--if it wasn't for you, Giles, and Xander, I'd have been dead a
long time ago--so you've got to promise to come to us when things start closing
in on you." <I>Come to <B>me</B> when things start closing in on you</I>,
that inescapable inner commentator amended loudly enough that Buffy wondered if
she'd spoken the words aloud for just a moment.</P>
<P>"Yeah," Willow exhaled and the two girls sat silently for a long
moment.</P>
<P>Suddenly Buffy bounded to her feet. "Come on, up and at 'em," she
commanded with a laugh as she spun away and began digging through Willow's
closet, tugging out clothes with unusual abandon.</P>
<P>Willow blinked in sleepy confusion. "'Scuse me?" she questioned.</P>
<P>Buffy pivoted neatly to face her friend. "I've been remiss in the whole
best-friend department," she explained. "We haven't done a chocolate
and sympathy night yet."</P>
<P>"Buffy, it's two o'clock in the morning," Willow pointed out
reasonably, but the Slayer was not to be deterred.</P>
<P>"Look, Will, at times like this, the only surefire cure is a total
junkaholic pigout. Chocolate, chips, anything that's loaded with grease and bad
for you."</P>
<P>Willow stared at her friend with a faintly perplexed smile. "I repeat,
it's two o'clock in the morning. Where do you plan on getting this junkfeast?
Besides, chocolate never solved anything."</P>
<P>"Answer to question one." Buffy held up a finger to keep count.
"We're college students, where do we get any kind of food-type-stuff."</P>
<P>"Twenty-four/Seven," both girls chimed in at the same time,
referring to the 24 hour quickie mart on the edge of campus, where the food was
stale, the prices high, the beer domestic, and the help surly. It was, of
course, where all the college students got most of their non-collegiate All
Aboard Card approved survival provisions, like beer, circus peanuts, beer, Count
Chokula, beer, Ding Dongs, and, of course, beer.</P>
<P>"And as for solving things," Buffy continued. "It's broccoli
that never solved anything. Chocolate can solve everything."</P>
<P>"You've been watching Mary Tyler Moore reruns on Nick at Night again,
haven't you?" Willow demanded, but allowed herself to be pulled from bed by
her eager to bring good cheer roommate.</P>
<P>"Hey, she's gonna make it after all, doncha know?" Buffy thrust the
clothes she'd chosen at Willow. "I find this a very inspiring
message." She turned away at her friend's pointed look, trying not to
listen too avidly as she heard clothes being removed and then put on. "I
always thought Mary woulda made a good Slayer, y'know," Buffy continued,
chatting in an effort not to think about Willow standing naked or near-naked
just behind her. Those dreams really had been getting to her. She couldn't help
but wonder what her friend would think if she knew about them. Be horrified
probably, she concluded, though that taunting voice kept suggesting she ask and
find out.</P>
<P>"Nah," Willow disagreed as she finished dressing. "Mary was
too soft-hearted. She'd have let them go."</P>
<P>"Rhoda then?" Buffy mused aloud as she caught Willow's hand in her
own, dragging her out into the hallway.</P>
<P>"Nah, the one who would have made a really killer Slayer was Ida."</P>
<P>"Ida?" the Slayer repeated as she drew a blank on the name.</P>
<P>"Y'know, Rhoda's mother. The little redhead."</P>
<P>"Oooo, you're right. She <I>was</I> mean. Must have been the hair. You
know what they say about redheads."</P>
<P>"Hey!" the redhead yelped, but she clung tightly to her best
friend's hand as they wandered away into the night.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</P>
<P>The Twenty-Four/Seven was like most such places; small, cramped, full of
stale candy, overpriced sandwiches, canned beer, and underaged students trying
to buy all of the above using parentally paid for credit cards and illegally
altered I.D.s. Even as Buffy and Willow entered and began moving among the
narrow aisles, plucking up an assortment of the nastiest candy and chips they
could find, they were treated to the sounds of a pretty young blond arguing
vociferously with the clerk at the counter, who was a hundred if he was a day.</P>
<P>"Dammit, all I want is one beer," she snarled in frustration, while
the clerk peered at her ID through coke-bottle glasses.</P>
<P>"I'll admit, it's a good fake," he allowed grudgingly.</P>
<P>Buffy peered over the shelves just as he looked up at his youthful nemesis
over the edge of his glasses. "But we both know it's a fake."</P>
<P>The young woman slapped a hand on the counter. "Look, just because I'm
cursed with good genes--"</P>
<P>"That's nice," the clerk said smoothly and tossed the card
somewhere under the counter. "But nobody has genes that good--"</P>
<P>"Now, wait one damn minute...."</P>
<P>Buffy ducked back behind the shelves, blushing with embarrassment as she was
reminded of her own adventures in beer-drinking.</P>
<P>Willow looked over to meet Buffy's gaze, her own cheeks flushing with her own
memories of that night--of being cuddled up against the warmth of Buffy's body,
the feel of primitively eager lips on her own.</P>
<P>"Heh," Buffy half-laughed on a nervous quaver. "Beer...now
there's something I'd just as soon go through the rest of my life not thinking
about."</P>
<P>"I dunno, NeanderBuffy had her charms," Willow teased before she
had a chance to think about it and squelch the impulse.</P>
<P>Buffy's eyes rounded, her mouth forming a perfect O as she stared at her
friend in surprise. "Will," she croaked, because, while she supposedly
didn't remember that night--though, in reality, it was clear as a bell, a
frequently ringing bell in view of how often it seemed to replay in her
head--Willow unquestionably remembered and didn't even have the protection of
feigned forgetfulness. "I...uh..." Not for the first time, the Slayer
wondered what her best friend thought of the whole experience. She certainly
didn't sound repulsed by the memory.</P>
<P>By then Willow had realized what she'd said and tripped right into babble
mode. "I...that is...I meant...."</P>
<P>Both girls fell silent, staring at each other, uncertain what to say or do,
both remembering the heated intimacies they'd shared in the darkness, each
wondering what the other was thinking.</P>
<P>"Look, will you at least kindly return my driver's license," the
young customer's angry voice broke in on their unspoken conversation, saving
both girls the necessity of a response.</P>
<P>Buffy straightened, peering over the edge of the shelves once again,
automatically checking to make sure things weren't getting out of hand.</P>
<P>"Look, kid, look at it this way; I'm doing you a favor. A cop catch you
with that thing and you'd be in real trouble," the clerk lectured, though
Buffy noticed there was a certain malicious glee in his eyes. Working amid frat
rats and sorority chicks, not to mention all those goddamn GDI's had not left
him overly fond of the college age crowd.</P>
<P>The young woman leaned across the counter, her hands braced solidly on the
top. "Dammit, I don't have time for this..." She started to reach
across the counter.</P>
<P>Buffy tensed as she felt a familiar tingle of apprehension. "Will, stay
here," she snapped, dropping the half dozen things she was already carrying
and moving to round the end of the shelves. She slid her hand inside her jacket,
checking on the familiar weight of Mister Pointy where he resided in an inner
pocket.</P>
<P>The clerk reached out with a meaty fist, shoving the young woman back several
paces with an angry snarl. "Don't pull that garbage with me, little
girl!"</P>
<P>The tingle had become a raging shiver as Buffy moved forward, uncertain where
the danger came from, but knowing it was there.</P>
<P>The blond customer took a half step forward, her body language broadcasting
her anger as clearly as words and then suddenly pivoted, staring through the
broad glass panes that fronted the tiny store.</P>
<P>Buffy's gaze followed the other woman's less than a second later as time
shifted, slowing until it was measured in heartbeats instead of seconds.</P>
<P>The three men who came rushing through the double doors to the small store
were all dressed in black from the tips of their steel-toed jackboots to the
collars of their black dusters and the knit of their ski masks. The only trace
of color was a tiny rim of red stitching around the eyeholes of the ski masks,
Buffy noted with the perverse attention to detail that she'd learned as the
Slayer. Each carried a pump action shotgun, held high and pointed at the tiny
group of people.</P>
<P>Before Buffy could do more than draw a breath, the barrel of a shotgun was
shoved in her face.</P>
<P>"I wouldn't move, little girl," her assailant snarled, his voice
ragged with stress, his eyes both scared and excited where they gleamed behind
the rough knit of the mask.</P>
<P>Near the counter, the young woman who'd been arguing with the clerk was
receiving similar treatment, which meant Buffy didn't dare try anything. She was
certain she could disarm her attacker without injury, but there was too much
chance the others would get off a shot or two before she could do anything to
stop them.</P>
<P>The clerk apparently wasn't so cautious, because he made a dash for something
under the edge of the counter, only to crash headfirst into a shotgun butt. The
force behind the blow knocked him backwards into the cigarette display, sending
packs flying everywhere and upending a rack of adult magazines. He hit the floor
hard and before he could even think of trying anything else, the third assailant
vaulted the counter, slamming a hard kick into the man's chest.</P>
<P>"Man, that was stupid," the thief snarled as he heaved a final kick
at his victim, then began hammering on the cash register in an apparent attempt
to get at the money inside. Finally, he grabbed the clerk by the collar, hauling
him to his feet as he ordered, "Open it!"</P>
<P>Buffy risked a sideways glance out of the corner of her eye, mentally willing
Willow to stay down and quiet, as she tried to see if there was any sign of her
friend.</P>
<P>Still hidden behind the shelves, Willow crouched down, trying to think of a
way to help and coming up with absolutely nothing. Despite the generally deadly
quality of Twinkies, she was comparatively certain that throwing them at someone
wasn't likely to do much damage. Still crouched, she glanced up, noting the
rounded security mirror in one corner of the store which let her see where the
bad guys were positioned. Of course, if any of them looked up, they'd also see
where she was positioned, but there wasn't really much she could do about that.
She mentally calculated the distances, then eyed the shelves that formed her
scant cover. They were light enough that she thought she could probably shove
them over. If a couple of the thieves would just--</P>
<P>"You're pretty, little girl," the sneering leering voice broke into
Willow's half-formed plans and she peered up into the mirror just as the one
holding a shotgun on the would-be beerdrinker sidled up to the young woman near
the counter, jamming the barrel of the weapon against the underside of her jaw.
"Maybe we should just go in back and have a little party of our own."</P>
<P>She tensed, but didn't respond as he backed her against the counter, using
his body to pin her in place.</P>
<P>The clerk had finally gotten the now-battered cash register open, and the
thug behind the counter was merrily stripping the money out of the drawer and
shoving it in his pockets. "Hey, go for it, man." He turned, leering
at Buffy. "Maybe we should all have a party and..." And then he
trailed off.</P>
<P>Willow felt her heart skip at least a half a dozen beats as she realized he
was staring back at her reflection in the mirror.</P>
<P>"Shit, there's another one back there!" he shouted to his buddies
as he vaulted the counter.</P>
<P>Willow scrambled, stumbling backwards, but had neither the time to escape,
nor any available route. Somewhere in the distance, she heard Buffy call out her
name, but knew there was nothing the Slayer could do to help since she was as
vulnerable to a shotgun blast as anyone else. Her attacker was on her in a
second, rough hands grabbing at her clothes, and slamming her this way and that,
sending bags of chips and bottles of designer water flying. She tried to fight,
but he was too strong and too fast and she never had a chance. Upended by her
attacker, the world tumbled by at dizzying speed until suddenly she was hurled
forward to go skidding across the floor, not stopping until she bodily slammed
into a human barrier. Her ears ringing, Willow pushed up on one hand, leaning
against the legs that had stopped her wild skid, momentarily thinking they were
Buffy's until she realized the Slayer was in front of her, her head tipped back
by the pressure of the a shotgun barrel, every muscle in her body tense with the
barely leashed need to do something.</P>
<P>"Buffy, don't," Willow croaked, her voice sounding rough to her own
ears.</P>
<P>A hard hand dug into crimson hair, dragging Willow's head back as the one who
appeared to be the leader taunted, "Yeah, <I>Buffy</I>, don't."</P>
<P>She was shaking hard, dazed, tasting blood. God, they couldn't even go to a
quickie mart without something bad happening.</P>
<P>"Well, this is a nice development," the leader continued as he
leered down at her. "A dance partner for each of us."</P>
<P>A hand curved to Willow's shoulder, steadying her when she might have gone
down and she risked a glance up at the would-be beerdrinker. She was ghostly
pale, her hand cold and clammy where it was braced on Willow's shoulder. Willow
recognized the look of disbelieving horror on her face all too easily. When
she'd first known Buffy she'd felt that way on more than a few occasions. Of
course, those had been supernatural villains, not garden variety thugs, but the
terror wasn't so different. After all, most twenty year-olds consider themselves
immortal whether they've ever met otherworldly dangers or not.</P>
<P>The clerk, bleeding from his nose and mouth, pushed unsteadily to his feet,
an arm braced across his midsection. "Look, you've got the money you
wanted. Just go."</P>
<P>Before anyone could move, the leader slammed the butt of his shotgun into the
clerk's face, sending him crashing to the floor in an unmoving heap. "When
I want your opinion, I'll ask for it, old man." The leader chuckled,
enjoying his triumph.</P>
<P>Buffy's eyes gleamed with the promise of revenge. If she could just find a
way to distract them and get those shotguns aimed away from Willow and the other
woman, they'd learn that her Slaying skills weren't limited to vampires.</P>
<P>Somewhere in the distance, the pulsing wail of a siren could just barely be
heard and three would-be thieves tensed. "Well, damn," their leader
cursed. "Looks like we ought to take this show on the road." He
grabbed for the blond where she was pressed against the counter, yanking her
close and grinning when she flinched in distaste as his alcohol sour breath
washed across her face. Emboldened by his actions, the other two started to do
likewise.</P>
<P>"I don't think so," the Slayer's angry growl cut through the taut
silence of the quickie mart, drawing the attention of all three of the would-be
thieves as she yanked her arm back from her assailant.</P>
<P>Willow wondered if her mouth was hanging open. Didn't Buffy realize there was
a shotgun-- actually, three shotguns, the hacker realized as she noted that all
of them had swung their weapons toward the Slayer--pointed at her, and these
people were nuts.</P>
<P>The leader was visibly startled by the refusal, his eyes narrowing through
the holes in the ski-mask. "Excuse me?" he drawled, his tone thick
with sarcastic rage.</P>
<P>The blond shook her head stiffly. "I'm not going anywhere with
you," she said, her voice menacingly low. "If I'm going to die, I'd
just as soon do it here...on camera." She nodded toward the security camera
hanging inconspicuously in one corner. "And not out in the middle of
nowhere after you and your friends have all had a couple of turns."</P>
<P>Willow saw the fury in his stance. He was going to kill her. She could feel
it like a black cloud hanging around him. And then she felt the leader move,
bringing his arm back as he raised the weapon to strike out with it the way he
had before. No! She couldn't let that happen! The shotgun stocks were made of
wood, and Willow reached out without even knowing she was doing it. As he
slammed the butt end of the weapon forward with enough force to rend flesh and
break bone, she grabbed it back with her mind. It was like solid wall went up
between the gun stock and its intended target, stopping it several inches short
of the Slayer's face even as she lifted her hands to block the weapon.</P>
<P>For a long moment, they all froze, each of the participants staring at the
scene in shocked disbelief.</P>
<P>The thief stumbled back a half step, shaking the gun as though it had somehow
malfunctioned. It was all the distraction Buffy needed as her own attacker
looked away from his prey and toward his confused friend.</P>
<P>In that instant, time warped and slowed until each moment took an hour to
pass. In the first second the Slayer brought her hand up, slapping her forearm
into the gun barrel pressed against her throat and knocking it aside. Before he
had a chance to respond, she turned her hand, wrapping inhumanly strong fingers
around the barrel and wrenching the weapon away from her attacker. He barely had
time to blink before she snapped it into his face, knocking him backwards into a
rack of snack packs of chips where he lay unmoving.</P>
<P>As another second passed, Willow saw the two nearest attackers aim their
weapons at the Slayer--they wouldn't be using them as clubs anymore--and gritted
her teeth--mentally shoving them up and away from herself with panic driven
force only an instant before they went off with deafening impact.</P>
<P>With ceiling tiles raining down on them, a third second ticked by. Buffy
leapt at the men flanking Willow where she knelt, her back pressed tightly
against the counter, her shoulder pressed into the blond beerdrinker's hip. The
Slayer hit the nearest man hard, the impact throwing them both into Willow, the
blond, then the confused leader of the trio like a trail of human dominoes.</P>
<P>As the fourth second passed, Willow lost all sense of what was happening in
the scramble of bodies and limbs flailing randomly in desperate combat. A
shotgun went skittering harmlessly across the floor as the Slayer disarmed one
of the two men. Caught in the middle, the hacker was knocked about with little
control over the situation until, suddenly, a hard hand dug into her shirt
collar, hurling her aside.</P>
<P>Willow tumbled free of the fray just as the fifth second ticked away, twisted
and looked back in horror as she saw the leader--at least she thought it was
him--pull a long, slender stiletto from the back of his belt. The Slayer's back
was to him as him as she blocked a roundhouse swing from his partner in crime.
Willow heard the tortured sound of her own voice screaming in warning, "BUFFY!!"
as she lunged forward, bounding to her feet and hurtling herself at her best
friend's attacker with raw ferocity, determined that he would not harm her.</P>
<P>The sixth second saw the Slayer slam an elbow into the other thief's face,
shattering his nose as she tore the shotgun away from him with her other hand.
With only one of the attackers left, she spun toward her friend's call, horror
twisting her features as she saw the knife turn toward Willow even as she was
barreling straight toward it. There was no way Buffy could reach them in time
and she didn't even get a chance as the downed thief behind her managed to get a
hand around a free-standing shelf full of snack cakes and upended it into her
back.</P>
<P>As the clock counted down the seventh second, Willow saw Buffy skid and fall
forward while she was backpedaling wildly in an effort to escape the knife
thrust toward her. Her feet slid on the slick tiles, sending her crashing
backwards into a magazine rack. There was nowhere left to go and no time left to
go there anyway. Pain rattling through her back where she'd hit the sharp edged
metal rack, Willow's eyes instinctively snapped shut and she turned her head
away, blindly trying to escape the sight of the silver blade aimed toward her.</P>
<P>As the eighth second fell away, Willow was startled to feel a body impact
into her instead of the sharp blade of the stiletto. She blinked her eyes open
as blond hair touched her cheek, automatically wrapping her arms around the
slender figure that had somehow stumbled between her body and imminent doom. For
the briefest moment, she thought the blond hair that dusted across her face was
Buffy's, that somehow the Slayer had made it in time to put herself between
Willow and death one more time, but then she realized it was too short, while
the dead-weight figure in her arms was dressed all wrong. Unable to support the
other woman's weight, she could only cushion her boneless collapse to the floor
even as she heard her own voice screaming Buffy's name. Her eyes lifted to where
the thief stood over her, staring down at his victim with a wide-eyed look.</P>
<P>By the time the ninth second passed what he thought or didn't think was
irrelevant. Buffy took him down so quickly and so hard that it was unlikely he'd
be moving again on his own for at least a week. She scrambled past their
attacker, skidding to one knee beside Willow. "Will?" the Slayer
panted, terror making her eyes glitter with wild lights. All she knew was that
in one instant the knife had been headed for her friend, and then by the time
she was done with the bastard, Willow was cradling another victim in her arms.</P>
<P>Time began to collapse again, gaining momentum as the tenth second counted
off, the seconds moving by more quickly, tumbling away, never to be seen again.
"She needs an ambulance" the hacker panted. The woman in her arms lay
half on her side, shaking, her mouth working soundlessly as she instinctively
coiled her body around the knife still stuck in her gut.</P>
<P>The eleventh and twelfth second slid by while Willow comforted the bleeding
victim. "An ambulance?" the young woman croaked weakly, her body
trembling violently while her blood continued to spill onto the speckled floor
tiles. "Doctors...hospital...yeah...." She coughed heavily, blood
spilling onto her lips.</P>
<P>The clock ticked down the thirteenth and fourteenth seconds as Willow
promised, "It's going to be okay," trying to offer what scant comfort
she could, her hands quickly drenched in the flow of dark blood she was trying
in vain to staunch.</P>
<P>Another three seconds passed as the young woman struggled to speak.
"Don't think so," the blond groaned, her expression twisted by the
pain from her injury. "Gotta stop zigging when I oughta zag...." She
looked up at Willow, meeting the hacker's frightened gaze with one that was
oddly calm. "It's okay," she whispered weakly. Then she shuddered and
went horrifyingly limp in an instant.</P>
<P>More seconds came and went as Buffy felt for a pulse, fingers searching the
woman's slender throat. "Will," she whispered after a beat. "I
think she's dead."</P>
<P>The hacker shook her head slowly, wanting to deny the obvious; that another
human being had died in her place. "No...maybe there's a spell--"</P>
<P>Buffy kept searching, but there was no trace of a pulse and the skin beneath
her fingers was already cooling. "Will, she's gone." Buffy slid an arm
around Willow's shoulders, hugging her hard.</P>
<P>Less than thirty seconds and a woman lay dead.</P>
<P>And the frightening part for Buffy Summers was the fact that as angry and
disgusted as she was, a part of her was profoundly grateful that it wasn't her
best friend lying dead on the floor. <I>Admit it</I>, her inner voice pressed, <I>you
couldn't survive that</I>.</P>
<P>In one of the odder coincidences that had long dominated Buffy Summers life,
that was the moment the police chose to arrive, guns drawn, ready for action,
and less than a half a minute too late. As the first officer burst through the
door, barking a sharp order, "Hands in the air," Buffy barely
contained the urge to laugh hysterically.</P>
<P>Soon enough they hauled the still-unconscious, handcuffed thieves out.
Apparently, the clerk had managed to trip some kind of silent alarm to summon
them, but they hadn't come quickly enough to do anything but clean up the mess
and send the clerk to the hospital. The officers that took both girls'
statements, were appropriately sympathetic, but there were a lot of details to
go over, especially when a detective pulled Buffy's name and file from the
police computer. As the questioning continued, in the background a forensics
team carefully took pictures of the dead woman, then zipped her into a plastic
body bag. It was going to be a long night.</P>

<P>Joyce Summers resisted the urge to curse as she took another swallow of
lukewarm coffee. For perhaps the thousandth time, she glanced at her watch,
noting the slowly advancing hour with a disgusted sigh. It looked like she
wasn't going to get any sleep. Not that the client she was scheduled to meet
wasn't worth the effort--after all, she was contracted to get ten percent of the
auction of the extensive collection of impressionist paintings and sketches the
woman was selling--but she was already nearly two hours late and Joyce had had a
long day. There was also the niggling worry that it was Sunnydale and going
missing in this particular small town was seldom a positive experience. She knew
more about that particular facet of her adopted home than she might have
preferred since her daughter was the Slayer--the Chosen One--tasked to protect
the world from the evils of the night--which included the Hellmouth, an entry
from the Netherworld that just happened to reside in Sunnydale, and attracted
every sort of evil known to man. She was proud of Buffy for the responsibility
she'd taken on, respected her child, knew that she was often all that stood
between life and eternal damnation.</P>
<P>But, if and when she was honest with herself, she had to admit it scared the
living hell out of her. Mostly, she dealt with the fear through sheer,
unadulterated denial, but it gnawed at her and left her terrified that she was
somehow failing her child due to her own inability to deal with the ugly
realities of life she'd discovered the night Buffy ran away from home. Her
daughter had come back and they'd made some kind of peace, but it all still
frightened her, driving her to push herself until she couldn't think anymore. If
she couldn't think, she couldn't worry and wonder what was happening to Buffy,
couldn't imagine the funeral she would probably have to attend one day. She
didn't know much about Slayers, but she'd learned enough to know there was no
retirement plan. Her daughter would die one day, and the chances were very high
she would all too young when it happened.</P>
<P>Joyce shuddered as though someone had walked over her grave and took another
sip of her coffee, silently willing her client to appear. Anything to block the
morbid path her thoughts were taking.</P>
<P>As if in answer to the unspoken summons, a soft knock rattled the art gallery
front door. Joyce's head snapped up, a relieved expression on her face as she
called out, &quot;Yes,&quot; and hurried toward the door.</P>
<P>&quot;Mrs. Summers,&quot; a warm, softly accented voice called through the
door. &quot;My apologies for running late.&quot;</P>
<P>Joyce swung the door open, revealing a very pretty young woman with short
blond hair, and what looked to be an almost delicate build under her heavy black
trenchcoat. She didn't appear to be much older than Buffy. Surprised, she took a
half step back. &quot;Devon Carstairs?&quot; She had expected her customer to be
considerably older.</P>
<P>The young woman smiled and shook her head. &quot;I'm afraid not,&quot; she
said hastily. &quot;I'm Blaine Michaels, Ms. Carstairs personal
assistant....&quot; She shrugged, still looking embarrassed. &quot;Also her
niece if you must know the truth. Dev had to leave for France rather
unexpectedly...there was a fire at an estate she owns near Luxembourg. She sent
me down here in her place...and unfortunately, I managed to have both a flat on
the Ten and a dead cell phone battery.&quot; Visibly flustered, the young woman
ran a hand through her hair. &quot;I apologize for keeping you waiting. Truly, I
had no idea I'd run this late or I would have called you before leaving Los
Angeles to let you know about the change.&quot; She stuffed her hands in the
pockets of the calf length black trenchcoat that flared around her slender legs.
Again she flashed an embarrassed smile, making Joyce feel churlish for any
annoyance she'd been feeling at the lateness of the hour. &quot;God, I swear, if
I weren't family, Aunt Dev would just fire me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't worry about it. I had to work late anyway,&quot; Joyce inserted,
and held the door wide as she waved the young woman in. &quot;Come on in. Your
aunt faxed me the crate number that was miss-shipped, and it's right back
here,&quot; she continued as she led the courier through the gallery toward the
storage area in the back.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm sure she'll be very pleased with how organized you are.&quot;</P>
<P>Joyce laughed softly. &quot;Well, it's quite a collection to get ready for
sale. She has some wonderful impressionist works.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; Blaine Michaels agreed smoothly. &quot;She inherited much of
it from my grandmother. She was the serious art collector...and, in truth, some
of the more valuable pieces in the collection came from her father...he was in
Europe before the war and picked several things up for a song.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm just amazed she's selling. I'd think it would be awfully hard to
part with some of them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, well, I'm afraid my aunt has suffered some financial setbacks this
year. The market has not been kind and she needs the cash.&quot;</P>
<P>Joyce flinched sympathetically. &quot;So sorry to hear that.&quot;</P>
<P>The girl shrugged philosophically. &quot;It happens.&quot;</P>
<P>As they entered the tightly packed confines of the back room, Joyce wove
between several rolling work tables as she gestured toward the front crate in a
stack of flat, painting crates stacked against one wall. &quot;It's the top
one,&quot; she informed her guest.</P>
<P>The young woman stepped fluidly past Joyce, her posture stiff as she pulled
up short in front of the crate. &quot;No,&quot; she said almost instantly.
&quot;This isn't the right one. It's too small.&quot; She reached out, brushing
dust off the packing slip taped to the outside of the wooden crate. &quot;Here's
the problem. There's a scuff mark. If you don't look closely, it looks like it
says Oh-four, but it's Oh-seven.&quot; She straightened and Joyce heard a soft
curse as she leaned past her to look at the error.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm so sorry,&quot; the tall blond apologized. &quot;How much
larger?&quot;</P>
<P>The young woman gestured with her hands, indicating a package roughly three
feet by four feet.</P>
<P>Joyce resisted the urge to curse. &quot;It must be one of the ones at my
house.&quot; She flushed at the annoyed look turned her way. &quot;The
collection is so large, and I needed more work-space here,&quot; she said
defensively. &quot;I stored some pieces at my house. If you like, I can go back,
get them, and bring them here for you. It shouldn't take me more than an
hour...two at the most.&quot;</P>
<P>The young woman glanced at her watch where it resided on her inner wrist.
&quot;Unfortunately, I have to be back in LA at eight am and I'm cutting it
close as it is.&quot; She uttered another curse under her breath.</P>
<P>&quot;I can have it shipped to any address you'd like--&quot; Joyce offered,
but Blaine cut her off quickly.</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; she said very quickly, then offered a tight smile. &quot;Aunt
Devon asked me to see to it personally. It's something of a family heirloom.
I'll just have to drive back tomorrow night. Is ten o'clock tomorrow evening all
right with you? I'm sorry it's so late, but I've got meetings all day tomorrow,
and I won't be able to get back to Sunnydale before then.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of course,&quot; Joyce agreed quickly.</P>
<P>The young woman smiled. &quot;Thank you, hopefully this time things will go a
little more smoothly and I won't be quite so late.&quot;</P>
<P>Joyce forced down an unexplained shiver as she nodded in agreement, shaking
hands politely and wishing her young customer well. She missed the brief glimpse
of thick blood congealed and drying on the young woman's dark shirt front as she
stepped out into the night and a fresh wind caught the edges of her coat,
briefly blowing them apart before slender hands pulled them back together.
Certainly it never occurred to her that she was doing a business deal with the
dead.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</P>
<P>&quot;Just another fun night in Sunnyhell,&quot; Buffy exhaled where she sat
on the front porch of the Twenty-Four/Seven, her legs stretched out in front of
her. To the east, the horizon was turning the soft shade of pink that heralded
morning. She looked up as she heard soft footsteps, smiling limply at Willow as
the hacker sank down next to her and leaned her head against the Slayer's
shoulder. &quot;You okay?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They had a lot of questions. I feel kind of stupid because I couldn't
really answer them. It all happened so fast that I'm not quite sure what
happened.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Buffy sighed tiredly. She would have sworn she'd known what
transpired in those final moments, but when she'd tried to describe it to the
detective, somehow she couldn't quite lay things out in a way that made sense in
her own head.</P>
<P>&quot;I'm not sure they believed me,&quot; Willow added, then buried her face
in Buffy's shoulder as though she could block the ugly events of the night out
of her mind.</P>
<P>&quot;Not surprising,&quot; the Slayer exhaled. &quot;They've obviously
looked up my files. That whole mess with Kendra came up...&quot; She leaned her
cheek against the top of Willow's head. &quot;God, some days I think I'm
cursed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You live in Sunnydale. I think it's one of the requirements,&quot; was
Willow's muffled response.</P>
<P>&quot;Point taken,&quot; Buffy sighed, so exhausted that she didn't have the
wherewithal to resist the urge to nuzzle Willow's hair affectionately, taking
comfort from the feel and smell of the silky strands.</P>
<P>They were still sitting there like that long minutes later, when Rupert
Giles' aging Citroen pulled up. The Englishman climbed out, his hair and clothes
askew, his expression rife with worry. &quot;Buffy...Willow...&quot; He searched
for any signs of injury as he hurried forward.</P>
<P>&quot;We're okay,&quot; Buffy assured him while Willow looked up and offered
a wan smile.</P>
<P>Giles ran a shaky hand through his hair as he looked inside the small store,
noting the police still working amid upended shelves and shattered glass.
&quot;What happened?&quot; He looked at the Slayer again.
&quot;Who...when...&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You forgot why and where?&quot; Buffy said acidly as she pushed to her
feet, then reached back to tug Willow up. &quot;But the answer is, three guys in
ski masks with shotguns, about three hours ago--&quot;</P>
<P>Giles appeared horrified. &quot;You should have called me sooner.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not an option,&quot; Willow sighed tiredly.</P>
<P>&quot;Mm,&quot; Buffy mumbled in confirmation. &quot;The police had a lot of
questions, and since Willow and I were the only ones not unconscious or
dead...&quot; she trailed off suggestively.</P>
<P>&quot;Dead?&quot; Giles exhaled, losing another shade of color at the
thought.</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah,&quot; the Slayer sighed and nodded toward the front door of the
store. &quot;Another customer. She never had a chance.&quot; She dragged a hand
through her hair, her tone disgusted as she muttered. &quot;So much for my
vaunted Slayer powers. I couldn't even stop three stupid thugs--&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;They had shotguns, Buffy,&quot; Willow reminded her. &quot;Nobody could
have done any better.&quot;</P>
<P>Giles settled a hand on the blond's narrow shoulder. &quot;I'm sure Willow's
right,&quot; he tried to reassure her. &quot;You may be the Slayer, but you're
not invulnerable. A shotgun blast will kill you just like anyone else.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy's mouth twisted in an grim smile. &quot;Yeah, tell that to the dead
woman's family. I'm sure it will be a lot of comfort.&quot; Then the Slayer
broke away and climbed into Giles' car without further comment.</P>
<P>Willow turned a sad-eyed look Giles' way. &quot;You know how she gets
when...well...when she loses one.&quot;</P>
<P>A muscle flexed in the Watcher's jaw. &quot;Yes.&quot; He looked at Willow
seriously as though trying to assess her condition. She'd been through so much
recently that he was worried about her. &quot;Are <I>you</I> all right?&quot;</P>
<P>There was a certain lack of sincerity to Willow's tone when she answered.
&quot;I'm fine. Just tired...it was pretty bad.&quot; Her shoulders tipped in a
prosaic shrug. &quot;But then again, we've both seen things that were a lot
worse.&quot;</P>
<P>Frowning, Giles demanded, &quot;What were you two doing here at this
hour?&quot; as though somehow their schedule was at fault.</P>
<P>The hacker shook her head. &quot;Just being silly,&quot; she brushed the
question off. She wrapped her arms tightly around herself, shivering in the
predawn chill. &quot;Look, Giles, I really think we should get back to the
dorms. It's been a long night.&quot; She wavered on her feet, so tired she could
barely remain upright.</P>
<P>The two stared at each other for a long moment, Giles suspecting there was
something else he should say, but at a total loss as to what. Finally, he just
nodded. &quot;Get in the car. I'll take you back.&quot;</P>
<P>It was only a little over a half a mile back to the dorms and the drive took
place in total silence, the three occupants of the tiny car all lost in their
respective thoughts. Willow had wiped most of the blood from her hands on a
towel the officer who interviewed her had handed her, but it was still caked on
her clothes and smell of it filled the crowded space despite the open windows,
reminding each of them of the night's high price.</P>
<P>Giles pulled into the small parking lot at the rear of the dorm, and parked
near the back doors, then turned to peer at the Slayer where she lay sprawled in
the back seat. After a brief glance at Willow, who appeared equally worn out, he
cleared his throat. &quot;Look, you two both look like hell. I'm not sure a
dormitory is quite the right place for you right now. Why don't you come stay at
my place for a day or two. Get some rest...deal with...what's happened...&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy let out a grim bark of laughter. &quot;I don't know. Will, you think
Dr. Walsh would let us have the day off for stumbling into the middle of a
murder?&quot;</P>
<P>A swell of hysterical giggles bubbled up from the hacker's chest. &quot;Only
if we were the victims.&quot;</P>
<P>That appeared to strike Buffy as hilariously funny much to Giles' chagrin,
though he quickly realized it wasn't real laughter, but rather a way of venting
the monstrous stress of the evening. &quot;Buffy...Willow...&quot; he said in a
carefully controlled voice. &quot;It's obvious that you're--&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Too tired for this conversation,&quot; Buffy cut him off impatiently as
she climbed out of the small car, then reached back to catch Willow's hand and
tug her out as well. She ran a trembling hand through her hair. &quot;Look,
Giles it's not that I don't appreciate the offer, but I really want to sleep in
my own bed tonight...&quot; Then, noting that it was rapidly becoming daylight,
she snorted something impolite under her breath. &quot;Or not sleep as the case
may be.&quot; She sighed heavily. &quot;Besides, hanging with Spike and watching
Passions together is not my idea of a therapy day.&quot;</P>
<P>Giles glanced at the sleepy redhead standing next to the Slayer.
&quot;Willow?&quot;</P>
<P>The girl shook her head. &quot;I don't think so,&quot; she demurred without
further explanation.</P>
<P>The Watcher sighed heavily, quashing the urge to order them back into the car
with effort. He could see the exhaustion and hurt in every facet of both girls
and wanted nothing more than to protect them and help them through it.
Unfortunately, by the look of it, they were no more receptive to the help he
wanted to offer than he would have been at that age. &quot;Be careful,&quot; he
said at last. &quot;And remember, you can always call me...&quot; He turned a
piercing gaze on the Slayer. &quot;I know I'm not officially your Watcher
anymore, but I hope I'll always be your friend.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of course you are,&quot; Willow filled in instantly, though the Slayer
was silent for a long moment. Suddenly, she blinked back to the real world and
nodded, confirming Willow's words.</P>
<P>&quot;Of course we're friends, Giles,&quot; she assured him.</P>
<P>And if there was a note of reserve in her words, well, it was understandable
after the night's events. Shock and all that. At least, that was what Rupert
Giles told himself as he got back in his car and drove away.</P>

<P>&quot;Do you want to talk?&quot; Willow questioned, her voice sounding
curiously hollow even to her own ears.</P>
<P>Buffy looked at her sideways. &quot;Not really...you?&quot; The question was
dryly asked, making it clear that the Slayer was in no mood to discuss anything.
She turned away and began digging through her closet, yanking out clothes.</P>
<P>Willow stared at her friend's stiff back, uncertain what to say or do. The
comforting closeness that had existed between them in the aftermath of the
attack had evaporated somewhere during the drive to the dorm, and the hacker was
far from certain why. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Fine,&quot; Buffy clipped without elaborating as she continued putting
her things together.</P>
<P>Her arms wrapped tightly around herself, Willow blinked back the tears
threatening to fill her eyes. &quot;Yeah, I can see that,&quot; she said so
softly Buffy almost didn't hear the words.</P>
<P>Buffy froze, stiffening. A beat passed, and then she slowly turned enough to
look back over her shoulder at her friend, wincing as she saw the blood that
still stained Willow's clothes, a hauntingly tangible reminder that she wasn't
the only one who'd had a bad night. A muscle pulsed in the Slayer's jaw and she
started to say something only to fall silent at the last moment. Finally, she
just muttered, &quot;I need a shower before I get to class,&quot; and hurried
out. <I>Coward,</I> that annoying inner voice whispered in her ear, daring her
to turn back, but for once, the Slayer wasn't up to being brave. She just needed
to run away.</P>
<P>Willow stared at the closed door that lay between them for a long time before
she finally staggered forward and grabbed her own clothes. Buffy wasn't the only
one in dire need of a shower and the thought of being alone left her slightly
nauseous.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</P>
<P>The day that followed was the sort that crawls--<I>slowly</I>--by. Willow sat
dazedly in her classes, barely conscious of what her teachers were saying and
perversely grateful that she only had one class with Buffy on Fridays, the
eminently ditchable Freshman Composition--her grade was so high in there that
she'd have to miss it for a month before she even dropped to a B--and after the
little scene in their dorm room, she just wasn't in the mood to see her best
friend.</P>
<P>When her four o'clock class, Principles of Concurrent Programming--a
whiz-bang paradigms course from the computer department that even she found more
than a little challenging--swung around, she was so tired of it all that she
almost scrapped it and took Giles up on his offer to use his guestroom. If it
weren't for the fact that Buffy's Watcher would have wanted to know what was
going on--and Willow honestly didn't have an answer for that--she would have. So
instead, she went to class, sat in the back--a lonely position to say the least
since the ambitious crowd that made up the student-body tended to take the front
rows--and spent the entire ninety minutes doodling in her notebook and
completely ignoring the professor's lecture. Particularly somewhere during the
last fifteen minutes when she started crying and couldn't seem to stop: big fat,
soundless tears that fell from her cheeks and made her doodles blot when they
hit her notebook. Lost in her own private misery, she didn't notice class had
ended until she realized other students were filing out the door, most of them
merrily plotting a wild weekend of programming and hacking. The joys of Fridays
in the farthest reaches of geekdom. If she hadn't already felt so depressed, it
would have taken Willow down another notch. As it was, she just ducked her head,
letting her bangs fall across her forehead, and hoped no one noticed the tears
as she pretended to be finishing up her notes. Finally, when everyone had gone,
she stuffed her things together and hurried out. To hell with it all. She was so
tired she could barely stay on her feet and if Buffy wanted to fight, she was
comfortably certain she could just sleep through it.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</P>
<P>Willow was already asleep--or at least she was in bed and feigning
sleep--when Buffy got in. It was barely dark out, making her feel guilty for not
being outside fighting the evils she knew ranged through the night--Giles and
Xander had both more or less ordered her to take the night off, promising to
take her place. Her hands fisted at her sides. She would have preferred to just
see to her patrol. It was her duty. Besides, the notion of killing something was
almost uncomfortably appealing. She'd been hoping to blow off some of the angry
stress that had settled in the pit of her stomach and between her shoulderblades.
Unfortunately, both of her friends had been insistent and even Anya had
helpfully commented on how awful she looked. After that, the walk back to campus
had seemed longer than she remembered. Unfettered by the strain of concentrating
on the fight at hand, the Slayer's brain had busied itself by pursuing any
number of mental paths she would have preferred to avoid.</P>
<P>Like the way she'd treated Willow in the dorm room after Giles dropped them
off. She'd blown that one completely and she wasn't even quite sure why. Maybe
it was just the guilt and the reminder that, as the Slayer, she was supposed to
protect people, but from the moment she'd seen Giles she'd been even more on
edge. But, whatever the reasons, the fact remained that she had failed and hurt
Willow. One. More. Time.</P>
<P>Buffy ran a hand through her hair, mentally castigating herself as she stared
at her friend's figure where she lay coiled into her blankets. She was fairly
certain that she wasn't sleeping, there was just too much tension in her
position and her breathing seemed too controlled, but she wasn't quite certain
enough to risk waking her. <I>Or maybe you're just afraid that you've finally
well and truly blown it for good</I>, her personal Jiminy Cricket whispered in
her ear. <I>And if that's the case, you've really screwed up your life but good
this time</I>.</P>
<P>Buffy sighed softly, amazed that she could be so brave when faced with death
and so damn cowardly when faced with her own emotions. Finally, she just turned
away and readied for bed in silence before finally falling onto her mattress in
a heap. Despite the profusion of thoughts running unchecked through her head,
she was so tired that she was asleep in moments. She never heard the soft
movements less than an hour later as Willow slipped from her bed to turn on her
computer. She'd slept for awhile on returning to the dorm, but Buffy's return
had wakened her, and she just couldn't seem to fall back asleep, so she decided
to get some work done, hoping it would distract her from her own thoughts and
fears.</P>
<P ALIGN="center">* * * * * *</P>
<P ALIGN="left">Joyce Summers grunted softly as she hefted a heavy crate
containing her customer's missing painting from the hand truck she'd used to
transport it in from her trunk, up onto a work table in the back room of the
gallery. Several nails and one plank had come loose during the transport and
they needed to be hammered back together. She cursed softly as another plank
came loose while she was lifting the crate. The delivery staff had been rough
with everything, but by the looks of it, this piece had suffered the worst of
the group. Once it was stable, she grabbed a hammer and moved to tap the nails
back into place only to set it aside as she noted the packing material leaking
from the gap between planks. Poking at it to try and push the shredded paper
back inside the bounds of the crate, she succeeded only in pulling more of it
out through the gap. After another round of curses, she used the claw on the
hammer to pull up several nails, hoping that if she released another plank, she
could repack the whole thing properly and then seal it up.</P>
<P>And froze. Joyce leaned closer, staring at what she could see of the painting
through the gap in the wood and packing. The painting was obviously wrapped in
thick felt padding to protect it, but the felt had ridden up, revealing an
ornate gilded frame and the bottom right corner of the canvas. Joyce frowned,
head tipping to one side as she saw the last part of the signature. She leaned
closer, frowning to make out the little snippet of the name. &quot;It can't
be,&quot; she whispered to herself, not believing what she was thinking. She
brushed more of the packing material aside and carefully pushed the felt out of
the way until the signature was completely revealed. &quot;It can't be,&quot;
the woman whispered, then glanced at her watch. It was only a little past six.
Four hours until her client was due to arrive. Which left her with more than
enough time to open the crate and then repackage it. She paused for a long
moment, debating whether or not she should do it. She leaned closer to peer at
the flowing script for a long moment, then picked up her hammer and began
removing nails.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * * * * *</P>
<P>Buffy Summers was dreaming and half aware of the dream state even as she
watched the events unfold. <I>She was at the Bronze, wearing something soft and
slinky that left her arms and shoulders bare and swirled around her thighs in
soft waves. Riley was there, dancing with her, his eyes glittering with the
familiar lights of lust that she'd learned to expect from most men, while his
friends were all around them, only they weren't dressed like they normally did.
Instead, they were wearing camouflage fatigues and some kind of combat vests.
She tried to pull away, and see better, but he kept tugging her back, his voice
smooth as he urged her to ignore them.</P>
<P>&quot;That's not important,&quot; Riley insisted, still moving to the music.
&quot;Only <B>this</B> is important.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Buffy!&quot;</P>
<P>The Slayer twisted and caught a glimpse of red hair, before her line of sight
was blocked by camouflaged men. &quot;That's Willow,&quot; she exhaled and
started to pull away only to have Riley yank her back.</P>
<P>He smiled down at her, hips swaying with the rhythm. &quot;Don't worry about
her,&quot; he insisted.. He leaned down and nibbled on Buffy's bare shoulder.
&quot;She's not like us.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy tried to subtly pull away, but his grip was too strong as he pressed
against her. She heard a pained cry and looked back in time to see Willow try to
break through the camouflaged wall of flesh, only to be grabbed and yanked back.</P>
<P>&quot;Ignore her,&quot; Riley muttered, trying to drag her back into the
dance. &quot;She's just a distraction from what's <B>really</B> important...<B>us</B>...you
belong with a real <B>man</B>...&quot; His hands slid over her shoulders and she
couldn't pull away even though she wanted to. It was like something held her
there and wouldn't let go. She braced her palms on his chest, trying to push,
but somehow unable to make her body obey the dictates of her mind, she found her
fingers digging into his vest--&quot;vest?&quot; her dream mind questioned--and
dragging him closer.</P>
<P>Willow cried out again, her voice thick with pain this time. &quot;Buffy!&quot;
She grunted, and the Slayer heard the sound of flesh striking flesh as Willow
cried out, &quot;Let me go!&quot;</P>
<P>And then the Slayer did find the strength to twist away, stumbling back from
Riley to turn toward her friend. Willow was being held between two of Riley's
camo-pals and they laughed cheerfully as she struck at them and tried to break
free. Parker was standing behind the girl, and he threw a leering wink Buffy's
way as he slid an arm around her friend.</P>
<P>&quot;Buffy, please,&quot; Willow whimpered, still struggling with her
captors. &quot;I need you!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No she doesn't,&quot; Riley whispered near Buffy's ear and yanked her
back around. &quot;She's not important,&quot; he repeated. He gripped her by the
hips. &quot;My friends will teach her what she needs to know.&quot;</P>
<P>Willow screamed then, the sound panicked and angry, and Buffy twisted away
from Riley, breaking his hold as she spun around.</P>
<P>The camo-creeps had lifted Willow onto a pinball machine, and Parker was
standing next to her, only now he was dressed all in black.</P>
<P>&quot;Now, isn't this a revolting development?&quot; a soft voice whispered
near Buffy's ear. The Slayer glanced back into pale green eyes. It was the blond
who'd died in the Twenty-Four/Seven, a wry smile on her mouth, an ugly gash
still marring her midsection. &quot;Don't you think it's about time you get over
it and do the hero thing...before it's too late?&quot; she asked dryly, then she
disappeared as Riley stepped right through her.</P>
<P>&quot;Don't you get it, Buffy,&quot; he demanded, dressed all in camouflage
now. &quot;We belong together...and she's just in the way.&quot; He grabbed her
one more time at the same time that Willow screamed. Parker was climbing on top
of her, pulling back his fist to hit her.</P>
<P>And Buffy lost it. She slammed an elbow back into Riley's face, thrilled by
the satisfying crunch of bone that echoed through the Bronze's loudspeakers,
then leapt at the men holding Willow, to send them flying like tenpins. She hit,
punched, and kicked with raw ferocity, taking them all down with vicious glee
until Riley's voice pulled her up short.</P>
<P>&quot;You just don't get it,&quot; he growled, the words punctuated by
Willow's tiny cries and Buffy slowly turned to face him. He was dressed in black
now, an arm wrapped around Willow's slender body, a sharp stiletto pressed
against her throat. &quot;You don't have a choice in this...and if I have to
kill her to get that through your thick skull....&quot; He trailed the point of
the blade down Willow's torso. &quot;Then I guess that's just what I'm going to
have to do.&quot; He shoved the point of the blade upward under the bottom edge
of Willow's ribcage so hard he lifted her off her feet.</P>
<P>Buffy couldn't move. It was like she was caught in cold tar as she heard
Willow's agonized cry and saw the way her breath caught. The hacker's face
twisted with shock, while her blood spilled over the blade where it was thrust
into her body.</P>
<P>&quot;I was just following orders,&quot; Riley said and flung Willow's body
aside.</P>
<P>&quot;NO!!!&quot; Buffy's scream echoed back to her as felt the awful
paralysis lift and she leapt at him, tackling into his body, taking him down
hard. She pinned an arm across his throat, his answering gags music to her ears,
and chalked her fist back, fully intending to kill him.</P>
</I>
<P>But before she could strike, the scene wavered, colors running like wet paint
in the rain, slowly morphing into another scene: Willow staring up at her in
horror, her hands held protectively in front of her face, her eyes huge and
terrified in her face. The Slayer frowned, uncertain what was real and what
wasn't. She glanced around herself, spotting the familiar landmarks of her dorm
room--the desks, posters, Willow's open, dully glowing laptop, Mr. Gordo--then
back down at the woman lying pinned beneath her on her bed. &quot;Will?&quot;
she croaked at last and dropped her fist, self-consciously uncertain what to do
with it. A dream...it had just been a dream.</P>
<P>The two girls stared at each other, both breathing hard and shaking with
shock and fear.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, God...Will...&quot; Buffy exhaled heavily and yanked her arm back
from the hacker's throat, bracing it on the mattress near Willow's head. They
were lying stretched out on her bed, Willow closest to the wall, Buffy half on
top, pinning the hacker to the mattress. &quot;I...I was...dreaming... I
guess--&quot; By the look of it, she had grabbed her friend, attacking her in
place of the dream-Riley.</P>
<P>&quot;More like a nightmare,&quot; Willow coughed, her voice rough in the
wake of Buffy's choke hold. &quot;I...I was getting some work done when you
screamed... I just came to see what was wrong...&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy brushed a few strands of hair off of Willow's brow with a gentle hand.
&quot;I am <I>so </I>sorry,&quot; she croaked in a voice suddenly thick with
tears. &quot;I didn't even know it was you...I-I thought...I
thought...someone...was trying to hurt you...&quot; Without thinking, Buffy let
her head fall forward until her forehead was resting against Willow's upper
chest. &quot;...and I couldn't protect you...&quot; Her hands were braced
against the bed on either side of Willow's waist and she shifted them to cling
tightly to the hacker's slender frame. &quot;I tried...&quot; she whispered as
though still caught in the nightmare. She could feel salty tears sliding away
from the corners of her eyes. &quot;But I couldn't....&quot; She couldn't think
straight, still overwhelmed by the awful horror of the nightmare, the image of
Willow's dead body still burning brightly in her mind. She just needed to hold
on and reassure herself it wasn't real...that Willow was okay.</P>
<P>&quot;Buffy,&quot; Willow whispered and lifted a hand to the back of the
Slayer's head, ruffling her hair gently. &quot;It's okay...I'm okay...&quot; She
brought Buffy's head up with a light touch, stroking her cheek and then along
her brow, staring deeply into the Slayer's eyes as she tried to soothe her
fears. She felt the wetness of the Slayer's tears on her finger and stared at it
in awe. &quot;You...you're crying,&quot; she exhaled at last.</P>
<P>&quot;I couldn't handle it if anything happened to you,&quot; Buffy breathed,
her voice so soft Willow had to strain to hear her. The Slayer stared down into
the hacker's upturned face, taking in the softness of gamine features, the sweet
beauty of her worried expression. <I>Kiss the girl</I>, her inner voice urged,<I>
now, let her know how you feel</I>.</P>
<P>For once Buffy was too tired and too steeped in need to resist the siren's
song of her own hidden desires. With hungry passion, she ducked her head,
tasting soft lips. She felt Willow tense and gasp, and only pressed the kiss
deeper, drinking in her friend's startled breath.</P>
<P>The hacker whimpered low in her throat, momentarily confused, but Buffy just
kept kissing her until she was lost in the burst of heat that flooded her veins.
She arched up against the Slayer, instinctively seeking more contact. Had she
been less tired, or less depressed and in need of comfort, Willow might have
been able to resist the sweet temptation, but not at that moment. She needed the
closeness...the feeling of being loved. Willow surrendered completely to their
passion, working her fingers into thick blond hair as she pulled Buffy closer.</P>
<P>Warm curves neatly dovetailed together, the two girls kissed, caressed,
stroked and explored, the soft sounds of their lovemaking filling the room as
they surrendered to the need flooding through them in that instant. Buffy
