<P>"Lt. Paris. What seems to be the problem?"</P>

<P>"Well, Seven I called you down to the holodeck because I need your help accessing it. I came here about 40 minutes ago hoping to use the holodeck when I found out that it was already in use. Although no one was scheduled for time on the holodeck now the computer seems to be running a program none the less. I asked when the program started but the computer said that that was unknown. I then asked who had started the program and again it replied unknown. I then ran a diagnostic of the system and sure enough there seems to be some sort of time loop in computer logs starting I presume rightt before the program was started. So I was then ging to fix the problem but to do so I needed to gain entrance into the holodeck but it wouldn't let me in. The computer said that the doors were sealed with an encription code in which only your access codes could open. So my curiousity got the better of me and I asked the computer what program was running. It's one of your programs, Seven. I didn't know you had a holoprogram. Care to......"</P>

<P>"Janeway to Paris. Please repor to the bridge."</P>

<P>"Damn. Paris here. Acknowledged Captain. Seven I guess I'll leave the diagnstic and repairs in your capable hands."</P>

<P>And so Paris left without finding out what is was that an ex-drone would program into the holodeck. Seven of course had stood in the hall silently listening to Paris ramble on about his problem but whe he mentioned her program running, the one with holograms of the crew which was illegal according to federation law, she was at first shocked that it would be running at all and the worried that Paris would find out things she did not wish for him to find out. Her worry was slightly relieved when the captain's interruption came, for once a welcome and timely occurance but how was the program initiated? She had to figure out what had gone wrong, correct the mistake, and then hope that no one else would happen upon this program. Seven thought about deleting it once and for all but she just couldn't bring herself to do it as this was the only world in which she could feel, in which she could love and be loved back. No she couldn't delet the program no matter how much risk was involved.</P>

<P>So Seven inputed her access codes and was readily allowed access to the holodeck. The doors swished open and Seven stepped from one corridor to another. Back on board Voyager, Seven bumped into Tom again.</P>

<P>"Hey, Seven there you are. I have been looking all over for you. How on earth do you manage to hide a six foot ex-borg so well?"</P>

<P>"I did not know I was suppose to be hiding. Perhaps next time you'd be gracious enough to yell 'ready or not here I come' so that I will be properly informed of my role?"</P>

<P>"Oh you are just soooo funny. Anyway, I came to find you becaue Lanna has something special planned for you."</P>

<P>"B'Elanna?"</P>

<P>"Yeah, do you know of another Lanna? You really made an impression on her with the song you performed yesterday. She found Neelix in the messhall and asked him to see the holovid he made of last nights show. According to Neelix she watched it at least 10 times, each time she watched it as if watching it for the first. Way to go Seven cause now she seems intent on returning the favor."</P>

<P>"Indeed?"</P>

<P>"Yes indeed. Now come on we have to get going."</P>

<P>Seven had a questioning look on her face as Tom dragged her off. All thoughts of examing the holodeck malfunction forgotten as curiousity took over.</P>

<hr>

<P>Seven entered the holodeck right behind Tom. It was the same programmed bar she had used last night to sing about her love for a certain half-Klingon. Seven was just slightly caught up in the atmosphere and the memories it invoked that she failed to realize just when she was seated at a table, the same table Lanna sat at yesterday, and when Tom had left her to go backstage. Again the house was packed with people all here to see the Voyager's Crew Band. With Chakotay still on the drums, Harry playing back up guitar, the Doc playing the piano, and Tom playing lead guitarist the only real difference to this group was B'Elanna singing lead.</P>

<P>Now that the guest of honor had arrived, it didn't take long for the show to begin. Again the lights were dimmed and a single spot light shone on the Doctor playing the piano as well as a seperate spotlight on Tom stringing the guitar, with a third spotlight shinning on the singer. The music was slowly keyed up and Lanna kept her eyes looking down as she sang the first words of the song.</P>

<P><I>Listen as the wind blows from across the great divide <BR>
Voices trapped in yearning <BR>
Memories trapped in time <BR>
The night is my companion <BR>
And solitude my guide <BR>
Would I spend forever here <BR>
And not be satisfied</I></P>

<P>The stage lights suddenly illuminated the rest of the band as the drums and back up guitar jumped in on the music already playing. Lanna looked up and for the first time really looked into the heart and soul of the woman sitting directly in front of her.</P>

<P><I>And I would be the one to hold you down kiss you so hard I'll take your breath away <BR>
And after I wipe away the tears just close your eyes dear</I></P>

<P>The guitar strings along the melody and Seven could feel herself getting lost in the passion of not only the song but of the woman who is singing it. The song really was a good choice for Lanna to make because not only does it describe who she is but also reflects the strong passionate woman Seven fell in love with.</P>

<P><I>And through this world I stumble <BR>
So many times betrayed dying to find an honest word to find the truth enslaved <BR>
You speak to me in riddles and you speak to me in rhymes <BR>
my body aches to breathe your breath your words keep me alive</I></P>

<P><I>And I would be the one to hold you down kiss you so hard I'll take your breath away <BR>
and after I wipe away your tears just close your eyes dear</I></P>

<P>Seven watched absolutely enraptured while Lanna danced on stage. Swaying her hips from side to side, hands grapsed on the microphone, eyes shut tight, it looked as if she was making love on stage. Perhaps in a way she was. She was making love to Seven through the words she sang, through the feelings she felt. And the band played on.</P>

<P><I>Into this night I wander it's morning that I dread<BR>
 Another day of knowing of the path I fear to dread <BR>
Into the sea of waking dreams I follow without pride <BR>
Cause nothing stands between us here <BR>
And I won't be denied</I></P>

<P>At some point B'Elanna had made her way down from the stage and was walking ever so slowly over to where Seven was sitting. All the while she kept singing.</P>

<P><I>And I would be the one to hold you down kiss you so hard take your breath away <BR>
And after I wipe away the tears just close your eyes dear <BR>
I'll hold you down kiss you so hard I'll take your breath away <BR>
and after I wipe away the tears just close your eyes.......</I></P>

<P>By the last line Lanna had made it to where Seven was sitting. Kneeling down in front of her, the Klingon wiped away her tears and closed her eyes.</P>

<P>B'Elanna whispered something but Seven was unable to discern what is was. She was too moved by what she had just seen that even as Lanna cupped her cheek she could not bring herself to open her eyes, unwilling to face the true reality of the situation. Seven whimpered when she felt the other woman's lips brush against her own in the lightest sweetest kiss she had ever felt. Not when Axum kissed her, not when she kissed the Chakotay hologram did anything feel so right, bring out so much feeling as did this one kiss from her true love.</P>

<P>"Seven. Seven, open your eyes." Lanna commanded in such a soft gentle tone that not many people would believe a half-Klingon capable of.</P>

<P>And so Seven opened her eyes. She looked into the smiling, loving eyes of the woman kneeling in front of her. It took Seven a few moments to register that something was wrong. Looking around Seven saw exactly what had caught her attention. The holoprogram had been shut down and in it's place was the standard grid format. But Lanna was still there as was the chair she was still sitting on. Suddenly realization hit.</P>

<P>"B'Elanna?!" Seven choked out as she scrambled back and away from the woman she could not believe was still here after the program had shut down. Seven tripped over the chair and had landed firmly on her backside.</P>

<P>"Easy Seven. Why didn't you tell me?" Torres had reached out her hands in order to stabalize Seven as she fell and ended up with her arms neatly wrapped around the ex-drone. Her voice wasn't accusatory like Seven thought it would be. Instead it had remained gentle and loving.</P>

<P>"I.... I...... I love you," was the only thing Seven could think of to say at the moment but it seemed to be enough as Lanna smiled in return, whispered 'I love you too', and leaned in to brush her lips across Seven's again.</P>

<P>Though the program had ended and their alotted holodeck time long ago expired neither woman felt it necessary to move from their positions on the floor. Each content to just hold the other for all eternity to come.</P>
