<p>For the past week now, the crew of Voyager has been very busy repairing the
ship yet again. Apparently, the section of space Voyager just past through was
suppose to be uninhabited according to Seven's data from the collective. Grid
2983 'was' supposed to be a barren star system in which Voyager 'was' suppose
to calmly and quietly sail through. Instead Voyager flew through a war zone,
literally. Seven failed to mention that her data was over 200 years old. The
Captain failed to ask how old the data was. Chakotay failed to act as devil's
advocate and question the data. Tuvok failed to have the ship at peak tactile
readiness to prevent things like this from happening. And the list goes on and
on. Everyone on the command staff (and even some crew members) felt they shared
some of the blame for endangering the ship, if not all the blame. But this
feeling of overwhelming guilt was something new for Seven. Even though she knew
it was illogical, Seven couldn't help but feel that if she had run current
senor sweeps instead of relying on ancient data than the ship, her collective,
would not have been harmed. (Never mind the fact that Harry had run senor
sweeps himself but could not detect the ships until they were almost on top of
them.) Janeway tried to convince Seven that it was not her fault for not
knowing about the neighboring species at war fighting over territory.
Technically the space was still barren but that fact made Seven feel not at all
better. And for her newly emerging humanity, Seven had a few choice words for.</p>

<p>Of course, one good thing did come out of all
this feeling guilty. Everyone was more than willing to work extra long hours
and work extra hard to get the ship, ship shape. No one was more appreciative
of this than B'Elanna was, who had the hardest job aboard ship, fixing it. But
the chief of engineer's job was lightened ever so slightly with the help of a
starship Captain, her first officer, and an ex-borg.</p>

<p>B'Elanna finally had to admit that she was
grateful for having Seven around, although this would never be said aloud it
was a start. Seven and B'Elanna had worked very closely for about a week now
and for some reason they were actually being civil to each other. Of course there
were times when Seven would go off on her own tangent and B'Elanna would scream
but old habits were hard to break. What was really odd was that the suppose to
be mortal enemies were seen spending time with each other outside of
engineering during their forced breaks. At first they would spend time with
each other talking about the repairs but then at some point it became personal.
They would talk about things that went on during the week, or about Icheb, or
new modifications to be made and such. B'Elanna learned a lot about Seven
during those talks and found out, quite abruptly, that Seven no longer held the
title of ice queen. In fact, Torres realized that under that cool borg
exterior, Seven felt responsible for the damage done to the ship for some reason.
The Lt. now felt quite guilty herself for the way she has treated Seven in the
past. No matter how hard Seven tries to deny it or how hard she tries to hide
it, Seven cares and feels just like any other human does. Although B'Elanna
couldn't change the past, she was determined to change the future.</p>

<p>Lanna had already made too many mistakes by
not admitting she was wrong. The most recent being the Tom Paris marriage
thing. She knew she had doubts before the marriage but she was determined to
make it work, especially since it seemed Tom was also so very determined. Only
problem was, she didn't love him any more. There was no more chemistry or
sparks to speak of so what else was left. They had never had anything in common
to fall back on so there was nothing keeping B'Elanna in a loveless marriage.
She finally broke things off three months ago and has been single ever since.
And since there was no marriage ceremony to make things official, it was easy
for her to null the marriage agreement. And now instead of spending time with
Tom or Harry, here she was spending it going over ways to dismantle the extra
borg alcoves no longer being used by the children. What a difference a week
makes.</p>

<p>Seven and B'Elanna had just come back from
cargo bay two, finished with the repairs needed there. So far all the major
repairs were completed and now only minor ones remained, such as the holodeck
controls and a few insignificant gelpacks in that same vicinity which could be
taken care of at the Chief's discretion. B'Elanna went over to one of the
engineering panels and began to input data as Seven came to stand next to her.</p>

<p>&quot;So Seven, since we've finished with your alcove, what do you say we
hit the holodeck?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That IS one of the last items which need to be repaired.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll take that as a yes.&quot; B'Elanna smiled as she looked up from
her work. &quot;Neelix asked me if we could finish up the repairs to the
holodeck in time for the Christmas party. And since work is light I thought we
could work on it today so that it'll be up and running in two days time leaving
Neelix with three days to program it. Looks like we get our party after
all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really?&quot; A dejected sounding Ensign asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Ensign Riley, you do not sound pleased that the holodeck will be
repaired in time.&quot; Seven stated showing off her observational brilliance.</p>

<p>Ensign Riley walked over toward her two superiors, who also happened to be
friends with Neelix and asked herself again why she had to open her big mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, what's the matter, don't you feel like celebrating Christmas
this year?&quot; Lanna asked all the none too gently.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's just that...&quot; Riley took a look around. &quot;Don't
tell Neelix this, but everyone is pretty much tired with the same party year
after year. We all want to do something new and decided to have our own little
parties. With the holodeck off-line we wouldn't feel so guilty for skipping his
party but since you're going to fix it we'll all have to come up with excuses
now.&quot; Riley concluded feeling like she had just been interrogated.</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed. Perhaps I may have a solution to this situation but you must
refrain from making excuses prematurely.&quot; Seven said in her usual cryptic
manner.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, you won't tell Neelix, will you?&quot; Riley asked wondering
which airlock was the best to jump out of.</p>

<p>&quot;No. I will not. I 'have an idea'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks Seven. I think I'll go back to work now.</p>

<p>Ensign Riley walked off before she could stick her big foot deeper into an
even bigger mouth. Which left a contemplating Seven of Nine and an intrigued
B'Elanna Torres.</p>

<p>&quot;So, are you ready to go to the holodeck?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed.&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna and Seven walked out of engineering after gathering the tools
needed for the job. It was a very silent walk considering B'Elanna was waiting
for Seven to tell her what she was planning on doing and Seven was waiting for
B'Elanna to ask. B'Elanna cursed borg patience.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay Seven, you win. Now tell me what the hell it is you are planning
in that borg head of your's.&quot; Torres glared at Seven.</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No?! What do you mean no?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are one of the 'biggest gossips' aboard Voyager and I do not want
my surprise ruined.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're surprise?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, my surprise, to the crew. Perhaps as a 'Christmas gift'.&quot;</p>

<p>And with that Seven left a stunned Klingon standing behind. 'A gift to the
crew? But why?' The chief engineer contemplated as she tried to catch up to the
ex-drone.</p>

<p>Unlike the rest of the ship, repairing
the holodeck was not as easy as first thought. Problem after problem would just
pop up out of thin air and it took B'Elanna and Seven an entire day to figure
out that there was another cause for these problems. It seemed that the damaged
gelpacks near by were interfering with the holodeck controls. So repairs were
stopped on the holodeck in order to first repair the gelpacks. While others
worked on the gelpacks, Seven spent some of her time going over her plan with
Neelix. Once she had convinced him to leave the holodeck programming to her she
started right away on the parameters for the program. Seven wanted to create a
program that held a part of everyone's Christmas memories in it and had decided
to create a 'Christmas town' for the crew to 'play' in. Unfortunately, the
holodeck controls were being most unco-operative.</p>

<p>Five days had gone by and B'Elanna and Seven could still be found in the
holodeck. The gelpacks that needed to be repaired were repaired, the circuits
that needed to be replaced were replaced, and yet the system was still not
functioning properly. Whenever B'Elanna would ask for the safeties brought
on-line she would get the exit archway to appear and whenever Seven would ask
for a pool of water she would get rain. Unfortunately it took both women three
times of going home soaked to realize that using water as a test parameter was
not such a good idea. It seemed that everything was repaired and operational it
was just that the computer was who decided when and how things would work. It
was still five days later and every crew member that B'Elanna and Seven passed
in the halls wanted to know when things would be fixed so that they could have
their party. Now Mr. Neelix's party was the talk of the ship again thanks to
Seven's surprise. It seemed that word had spread about Seven's 'gift' to the
crew and now everyone was curious as to what the ex-drone had planned but of
course no one wanted to wait for the party. Seven had gotten tired of
explaining the definition of a surprise and so had adopted the catch phrase of
'no comment'.</p>

<p>Both women were now spending even more time together trying to fix the
holodeck within the self imposed time limit of two days time. They were also
avoiding the crew who seemed hell bent on asking questions about the party
(even Naomi and the Captain had tried to interrogate Seven). Either the two
were on the holodeck trying to fix the problem or in cargo bay 2 discussing the
problem. Even though the holodeck was still not operational, Seven being her
usual efficient self, was able to set up the parameters for the program using
her computer in cargo bay 2. The only thing left to complete would be to repair
the holodeck. One morning, while on the holodeck, the two women had an
unexpected visitor.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey guys. How's it coming?&quot; Tom Paris asked as he strolled onto
the holodeck.</p>

<p>&quot;It is not 'coming', Lt.&quot; Seven replied in a clipped voice showing
how little patience she had for him right now.</p>

<p>&quot;I mean what's the hold up Lanna? You're suppose to be the best
engineer in the entire quadrant and you can't even fix this little problem.
You're suppose to be able to fix anything mechanical, well except maybe Seven
over there. No offense.&quot; Tom tried to joke except the other two women were
not laughing.</p>

<p>Tom of course was oblivious to his joke not being funny and missed the low
growl that came from Torres. But Seven didn't miss it and wondered exactly what
the engineer was growling at. Was it because Tom insulted her engineering
skills or was it because Tom had insulted her? The apologetic look Seven got
from B'Elanna answered that question. Perhaps their friendship had progressed
farther than Seven had thought, Seven had found herself hoping.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps, since you two can't seem to figure out the problem, then
maybe Harry and I can give it a try. I mean we are the resident holodeck
experts.&quot; Tom boasted which made B'Elanna rage even more.</p>

<p>That is until Seven placed a comforting hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps he is right. We need time to regenerate and having 'a fresh
pair of eyes' might be helpful. I heard the Captain use the phrase.&quot; Seven
explained when she received a questioning glance from Torres.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I guess you're right. I do need a break and the problem will
still be here when we get back. I don't suppose Tom can do any more damage than
is already done.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, I'm still in the room, guys.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever. Seven, want to go get a nutritional supplement in the mess
hall?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would enjoy a 'bite to eat'.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven and B'Elanna had picked up the habit of talking like the other because
of all the time they spent together recently. At first everyone thought it was
funny until the novelty of it wore off, at least for everyone except B'Elanna
and Seven. The two left Tom Paris alone to play in his home away from home.</p>

<p>The following morning, Tom had called both Seven and Torres as well as
Janeway to meet him in the holodeck. Janeway of course was the last to arrive
and when she entered she could have sworn she stepped right into WWIV. Tom and
B'Elanna were screaming at each other while Seven tried to keep a grip on the
Klingon's waist for fear that she might actually kill Paris if she let go.</p>

<p>&quot;Enough!&quot; The Captain called for order immediately. &quot;What is
going on here? Tom, you first since you did call this meeting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I called all of you here to tell you that I fixed the holodeck
programming and Lanna here wants to rip my head off because I fixed something
she couldn't.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a good thing that Seven was still holing onto the engineer because
now she was really determined to kill Paris.</p>

<p>&quot;Lt.! That's enough. Now I want your side of the story without you
killing anyone in the process.&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna finally calmed down but not because of the Captain's orders or any
strengthening of her will but rather because of the warm, calm, comforting arms
she was wrapped up in. Even though she was no longer struggling, those arms
never left her waist and B'Elanna was thanking every god she could thing of for
small miracles.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll start from the beginning Captain since Lt. Paris seemed to have
left out a few details. You see, when the holodeck was damaged so were some of
the gelpacks involved in the functioning of the holodeck. The gelpacks are what
connect the holomatrix to the main computer. Without that connection we would
only end up with two dimensional pictures in the holodeck instead of the three
dimensional interactive programs we run. In order to repair the gelpacks we had
to shut down the link and since then we haven't been able to get it functioning
properly again. The link was reestablished and we are able to run three
dimensional programs but the information comes through that link all jumbled up.
If you asked the computer for rain it would give you fire, if you asked it for
snow it would give you a sunny day. We tested the gelpacks and the systems
within the holodeck and they all check out fine, so we assumed the problem had
to do with the link itself. The wires must have gotten crossed somewhere along
the line within the gelpacks, so to speak. We spent the better part of the week
trying to narrow down exactly where the lines got crossed so we could fix them.
Instead, helm boy, here, decides to fly in here and do a quick fix. He switched
the link from the designated gelpacks for the holodeck to gelpacks that are
considered standby gelpacks which haven't been used in ages. My problem with
that is that he didn't even bother to check to see if the gelpacks were in good
working order. If one thing goes amiss then it could damage the whole system
even more. Not to mention that this is only a quick fix. I'm not even sure if
those gelpacks can withstand the stress created by the extensive use of the holodeck.
They could just as easily burn out creating more problems than before.&quot;
B'Elanna explained through clenched teeth.</p>

<p>&quot;I know it's a quick fix but that's all we need right now just so we
can have this Christmas party. Everyone is dying to celebrate and I for one
don't want to tell them to wait for you to fix a problem that can be fixed at
another time.&quot; Paris whined.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, enough. B'Elanna you check the holodeck computer and find out if
it is functioning within normal parameters. Tom, thanks for the help but I do
believe that you are needed on the bridge.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, aye ma'am.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom left disappointed that he didn't get the credit he deserved for fixing
the holodeck and saving the Christmas party. B'Elanna, on the other hand, went
over to the computer console and began running a level ten diagnostic on the
system.</p>

<p align=right><a class=link href="#top">Top</a></p>

<table cellspacing=0 width=100%>
<tr><td class=h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 3</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Nothing. It was an hour later and the diagnostic had revealed absolutely
nothing. The holodeck systems were functioning normally and the gelpacks
'seemed' stable, so why was B'Elanna so damned worried. With the results now
in, regardless of her reservations, B'Elanna had to report to the Captain that
systems were operational but not without a word of warning. It was now left up
to the Captain to decide whether or not to bring the holodecks on-line for the
Christmas party. Considering other factors such as the crew's desire to finally
be able to have this party, the R and R that everyone desperately needed, and
even the Captain's own curiosity to see what Seven had cooked up, the Captain
made her decision. She would trust the computer's diagnostic and allow the
party to be scheduled for the following night. Besides, if Seven or B'Elanna
couldn't find anything wrong than there probably wasn't anything wrong. At
least that's what she convinced herself of, forgetting that they were in the
Delta Quadrant and things had a way of surprising you.</p>

<p>And so the following night arrived with much anticipation, Voyager was
orbiting a small uninhabited moon in a fairly quiet region of space and only
the bare minimal skeleton crew was working (mainly those who didn't celebrate
Christmas). Janeway had given everyone else the day off in order to get ready
for the Christmas party that evening. According to Seven the attire was that of
something warm and preferably with layers. The Captain had dressed that morning
in a pair of light blue jeans with a shirt to match and then a sweater to cover
it. She also wore a pair of snow boots, a scarf, and a pair of gloves after
being able to wiggle out some hints from Seven. Everyone else seemed to have
followed suit and dresses similarly. The Captain had left Lt. Ayala (second in
command under Tuvok of the security forces) in command of the bridge. It seemed
that this time, Janeway didn't even have to make it an order for her senior
staff to attend the festivities. Even Tuvok showed a bit of curiosity, if his
raised eyebrow was any indication.</p>

<p>That night it was expected that everyone was going to arrive at the party at
various times. But what Janeway saw when she arrived in the corridor in front
of the holodeck completely threw her for a loop. The corridor was so packed
with crew members that if Janeway didn't use her captain's privilege she would
never have been able to get to Seven who was standing by the holodeck controls.
In Seven's arms was a bundled up little Naomi Wildman observing the crowd. Off
to Seven's right was standing Naomi's mother, Samantha Wildman. At first Sam
had been very reluctant to let her only child befriend an ex-borg worried that
Seven might try to assimilate her or worse. But all that changed when Sam saw
the way Seven acted when she was with Naomi. Although, Seven may not be very
good at expressing her emotions, when she was with Naomi one could see that not
only did Seven understand human emotions but she also felt them. Sam had
decided to take a lesson from her daughter and try to get to know Seven as
well, realizing that Seven was more human than most gave her credit for. Off to
Seven's left stood B'Elanna Torres, a surprise turn around. Torres was one of
the few people aboard Voyager who openly despised the ex-drone but as of late
she was singing a new tune. Even though it was some what forced, B'Elanna had
finally taken the opportunity to get to know Seven. She quickly found that
Seven was not the ice queen everyone thought she was, she just had a unique way
of showing her emotions. No one considered Tuvok to be made of ice even though
he did not display any emotions so why consider Seven in that light. The
Captain finally made it to where the group of four were standing.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, what's the hold up?&quot; Was the Captain's greeting. Even
captains can be impatient.</p>

<p>&quot;It is not time yet, Captain. The party starts at exactly 19:00 hours.
We still have 2.8 minutes left.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I just thinks she wants to build up anticipation even more,
Captain.&quot; B'Elanna commented as she smiled up at the ex-borg.</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed.&quot; Seven smiled back letting the small group know that's
exactly what she was doing.</p>

<p>The three women laughed heartily at that realizing now that Seven was even
more dangerous than before. Now this ex-drone knew the pleasures behind
torturous anticipation and she knew how to use it.</p>

<p>&quot;It is time.&quot; Seven whispered in Naomi's ear.</p>

<p>And with that, Naomi reached over to press a few buttons bringing Seven's
program on-line and in turn opening the holodeck doors. Even before the doors
were fully opened the crew began to make their way into what could only be
described as a winter wonderland. Walking into the holodeck, one would come to
stand atop of a small hill over looking a small inviting village. It was a
clear crisp evening with a full moon out in force illuminating the snow covered
ground. Scattered about in an evergreen forest clearing were small log cabin
with fires burning brightly inside. Children were playing about while their
parents watched on with glowing smiles. There were sleds to ride down the hill
on, which most of the crew immediately went to (including the Captain). There
were snow ball fights between many of the children which some of the crew got
caught up in (including Tom and Harry). And then there were the welcoming
inhabitants of the village which invited some of the crew into their homes to
talk and share hot apple cider in front of a warm blazing fire (including Sam
Wildman). Seven watched on from the archway with an ever growing smile on her
face. She was pleased that her gift was being enjoyed by all but the surprise
was not over yet. B'Elanna also stood in the archway but for different reasons.
She could not believe her eyes. This is what everyone imagined their Christmas
to be like only in reality it never was possible. The cold snow to pay in, the
warm fires to cozy up to, the hot apple cider to fill your belly, and most
importantly the friendly faces to celebrate Christmas with. Seven, the cold
emotionless drone, managed to create the ultimate Christmas town.</p>

<p>&quot;You've managed to create a whole Christmas town.&quot; B'Elanna
whispered.</p>

<p>&quot;Not just a town, but a Christmas experience.&quot; Seven whispered
back hinting that the night had only just begun.</p>

<p>Just then little Naomi came running up to the two all covered in snow.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on Seven. I'm going to teach you how to make snow angels. Naomi
declared as she began to drag Seven off to a drift of untouched snow.</p>

<p>B'Elanna wasn't sure if she should follow the two but after the questioning
glance she got from Seven she got her answer. By the time Lanna caught up with
Seven and Naomi, Seven was already on the ground with a huge smile on her face
waving her arms and legs about. Naomi then instructed B'Elanna to help Seven up
so that they could all see the angel Seven created. Looking down, B'Elanna
whispered in a not so Klingon fashion, &quot;An angel made by an angel.&quot;</p>

<p>But before Seven could respond a church bell off in the distance was heard.</p>

<p>&quot;We must go now.&quot; Seven instructed and led the group toward the
sound of the bell.</p>

<p>Following other groups of people, everyone eventually ended up at this very
large and long log cabin which the town's folk used as their town meeting hall.
The outside was decorated in green and red garlands strung up around the door.
Standing just inside the door was Santa Clause greeting all those who came in.
Naomi of course was to mature for Santa but Seven could detect a slight
widening of her eyes. Lifting Naomi in her arms once again, Seven brought their
small group into the huge dining hall. Inside was decorated much like the
outside using the green and red colors but also had other decorations such as
Christmas balls and tinsel, etc. In the center of the large room were long
tables in which held a banquet the likes of which not even Neelix could
imagine. (All of the food was real and waiting to be eaten thanks to Seven's
abundant amount of unused saved replicator rations; but no one had to know
about that part of the surprise.) Inside were also the town's people who were
all dressed up as little elves escorting the crew around and filling the tables
with even more food. In the center of the room across from the entrance was a
huge roaring fire keeping the room well lit and warm. Off to the left of the
fire place was a huge Christmas tree and under it tons and tons of wrapped
boxes. Real presents for the crew also supplied by Seven. If B'Elanna thought
the outside was fantastic she now had no words to describe this home away from
home.</p>

<p>Naomi looked up at that moment and saw something hanging directly above
three women. Naomi kissed Seven on the cheek and then B'Elanna explaining the
kiss by pointing up. Both older women looked up to see mistletoe hanging over
them. Naomi giggled at the looks that came over the faces of the two women and
then giggled even more as both kissed her on the cheeks simultaneously.</p>

<p>&quot;Merry Christmas, Seven and B'Elanna.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Merry Christmas, little one.&quot; Lanna answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Merry Christmas, Naomi.&quot; Seven responded.</p>

<p>&quot;Now it's your turn.&quot; Naomi prompted as she saw that Seven and
B'Elanna were not going to follow tradition.</p>

<p>Seven looked over to B'Elanna for confirmation with slightly widened eyes.
All Lanna could do was shrug her shoulders. Leaning into each other the kiss
was soft and sweet but powerful enough to leave both women dazed. But before
anything could be said or done, the Captain called to them absent-mindedly.</p>

<p>&quot;Lt., Seven, come take a look at this.&quot; The Captain called from
where the tree and presents were located.</p>

<p>Walking over, Seven deposited Naomi with her mother and took a look at what
the problem was. The wall by the pile of presents was beginning to destabilize.
Also at that moment, Ensign Timor came running in from outside claiming that
the forest scenery was also destabilising and fluctuating to the holodeck grid
format. B'Elanna opened up an access panel near the presents and moved out of
the way so that Seven could take a look at the controls. Using her mesh covered
left hand, Seven began to perform a diagnostic on the holodeck systems.
Unfortunately, the diagnostic proved to be too much for the system to handle
and there was a large energy feedback surge. With Seven's borg enhanced hand
touching the controls at the time of the feedback, she absorbed most of the
shock. Her implants almost immediately malfunctioned especially her cybernetic
hand causing her tubules to shoot out and connect with the computer interface.
The holodeck then returned to it's normal grid format leaving the food on the
floor, the presents in the corner, and everyone standing around watching
helplessly as Seven spasmed and then collapsed into B'Elanna's arms.</p>

<p>Seven stopped convulsing almost as fast as she had started. B'Elanna was
sitting with her back against the wall and had her arms wrapped tightly around
Seven, who was sitting between her legs. Seven's left arm was pulled up behind
her head because of the link between her tubules and the computer console. Her
eyes were open but they seemed blank almost as if she was blind, staring at
nothing.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven? Seven? Can you hear me?&quot; B'Elanna whispered in Seven's ear
with a calmness that she did not feel.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.. Lt. I can.. hear you.&quot; Seven whispered back in a broken
speech.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, you must disengage your tubules from the interface. Your
implants are being drained of power and your human systems have suffered from
shock. I need to get you to sickbay to repair the damage to your systems.&quot;
The Doctor said as he stood close by monitoring Seven's condition on a
tricorder he got from the emergency holodeck medikit.</p>

<p>&quot;I am unable to terminate the link because I did not initiate it. Lt.,
you must shut down the holodeck program so that the link will automatically be
severed.&quot; Seven whispered, keeping the answer clipped because she was
having trouble concentrating. Seven realized almost immediately that the
holodeck computer was accessing her cortical implant. From what Seven saw of
the scan she did right before the console ruptured, Seven realised that the
backup gelpacks had failed. Without a link to the main computer any more and
the holodeck still running, the computer was looking for a new source of
information to run a program. If Seven allowed the computer full access to her
'memories' it would run what ever pops into Seven's head as a program for all
those present to see. Suffice it to say Seven didn't want that to happen so she
was busy trying not to think of anything.</p>

<p>&quot;Lanna, Seven. Call me Lanna.&quot; B'Elanna whispered and then called
out to Vorik, &quot;Vorik, get down to engineering and try to shut down main power
to the holodecks, I want this program shut down now. Also send a team up here
to the main holodeck controls and have them work on shutting it down as well.
Whoever can get it done faster. I also noticed that the gelpacks for the
holodeck were fried so there is no more link to the main computer. Which means
you'll have to shut down the holodeck manually so get a move on.&quot; Torres
dismissed Vorik with a sense of urgency. Torres also realized what Seven was
going through, trying not to let the computer replay her memories for everyone
to see. &quot;Seven it might be better if you close your eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>At this point the Captain, who was holding Seven's right hand in her's, was
now furious. Not only did she not know what was going on but she began to feel
very jealous of the familiar way B'Elanna was interacting with Seven.
&quot;Lt., care to explain why it would be better for Seven to close her
eyes?&quot; And with that the engineer gave the Captain an abridged version of
what was happening to Seven. Now the Captain knew what was going on and was
even angrier because the chief engineer was now sitting cradling the ex-borg
(something the Captain felt she should be doing) instead of helping to speed up
the process of shutting down the computer. &quot;Lt., perhaps it would go a lot
faster if we had you trying to shut down the holodeck considering you are the
best engineer we have.&quot; The Captain suggested in a cold tone reflecting
some of her jealously.</p>

<p>This surprised Seven greatly causing a momentary lapse in concentration.
Seven opened her eyes slowly, showing just how weak she was feeling, and saw
the large pile of gift boxes left in a corner when the program shut down. A
memory of a past Christmas flashed through her mind and the computer
immediately picked up on it. A shock went through Seven's body causing her to
spasm and close her eyes again but when she opened them the holodeck was no
longer in grid format.</p>

<p>The entire Voyager crew present in the holodeck now found themselves aboard
the bridge of the starship Raven. Coming out of one of the adjoining rooms were
the Hanson's. Little Annika, who had to have been about five years old was
blind folded and being led by her mother and father to the helm console where a
brightly wrapped gift box was sitting atop of. The younger version of Seven of
Nine was trying to peak under the blind fold as she was being led to the
surprise. &quot;Now Ana, no peaking. Your Christmas gift is suppose to be a
surprise.&quot; Admonished Annika's mother. Now standing in front of the gift,
Magnus Hanson removed the blind fold and handed the package to Ana.
Unfortunately, before Ana could open it the ship rocked from side to side. Both
adults rushed to a computer console to find out what happened and found that
the borg were too close for comfort. &quot;Honey, why don't you take your
present inside and play for a little while and we'll have the party at another
time, okay?&quot; Magnus didn't wait for a reply as he went to work immediately
leaving a teary eyed Ana to go off and celebrate yet another holiday alone.</p>

<p>The holodeck then returned to normal grid format as Vorik's disembodied
voice announced that the holodeck had been successfully shut down. No one
present had a dry eye after witnessing that scene relayed from Seven's memory.
Even the emotionless borg had tears streaming down her face remembering the
heart breaking day and seeing her parents alive instead of living as drones.
Seven's tubules then released their connection to the computer and the Doctor
came over to scan Seven one last time. The results from the scan showed that
Seven's systems were returning to normal so the Doctor didn't press the issue
of a full exam in sickbay giving Seven some time to recover emotionally. Seven
was an emotional mess at this point and couldn't stop herself from weeping.
B'Elanna upon hearing this wrapped her arms tighter around Seven offering her
some comfort and then asked the Captain to clear the room. The Captain agreed
readily realizing that Seven would not want to be seen this way. No one put up
an argument but instead left quietly and peacefully affording Seven her
privacy.</p>

<p>After having dismissed the entire crew, calling an end to tonight's supposed
festivities, Captain Janeway went right back to Seven's side. Only she, Seven,
and B'Elanna remained in the holodeck together after shoving a worried Chakotay
out, an emotional Neelix, and a concerned Doctor. Kneeling in front of Seven as
she wiped away each and every tear that rolled down her face, Captain Katherine
Janeway finally let herself feel. Seeing Seven in such a vulnerable and yet
extremely human way, Katherine Janeway realized it was more than just a close
friendship she felt for this ex-drone. She was totally and utterly in love with
Seven. Looking back, Janeway could not remember a time when she didn't feel
this way, only the times in which she denied it for the sake of something else
whether it be Starfleet or her crew. Only that wasn't true now was it? On two
separate occasions did she put her crew in extreme danger in order to save
Seven from the borg queen. On another occasion she personally risked her life
to prevent Seven from committing suicide and possibly could have left Voyager
without their Captain had Seven not come to her senses. The Captain spent more
time with Seven then any other crew member and it was only around Seven that
she could relax her role as a Starfleet captain and just be Katherine. And now
here she was stuck in the Delta Quadrant with the love of her life but denying
that love out of obligations to others. Well not any more, she was not going to
let this chance at happiness pass her by. It's been seven long years of
isolation and distancing but time just seems to keep going and going not
waiting for anyone.</p>

<p>Looking up from Seven, Janeway saw that not only was time against her but
now it seemed she had competition. B'Elanna just sat there for what seemed like
hours cradling Seven and letting her cry. B'Elanna now more than ever wanted to
kick herself for the way she had treated Seven in the past. When Seven first
came aboard Voyager, B'Elanna saw her as a drone and nothing more. The engineer
blamed her for being apart of the collective and effectively assimilating
billions not realizing that Seven was a victim too. Now it seemed that when
they all thought that at least Seven lived a happy life for the six years
before she was assimilated that wasn't the case. Little Ana was forced to
follow around her parents chasing the borg never really having a place to call
home. Not only that but it also seemed that Ana came second to her parents's
work. But now after being severed from the collective, Seven had a second
chance at living a happy, if not normal, life. And Lanna was going to make sure
that happened. She didn't know when it happened but now Lanna was sure she had
fallen in love with the ex-drone. Perhaps all of that aggression she felt
towards Seven was really just sexual tension bubbling below the surface. It had
happened before with Tom except that this time it seemed to be even stronger
and more passionate. Perhaps Seven was her one true love, the one person she
could hate yet still love with both her hearts at the same time. The only real
question that still remained was, what does Seven feel?</p>

<p>Feeling Seven's sobs beginning to quiet down, B'Elanna was brought
back to the present. She had been stroking Seven's hair, rocking her back and
forth, and placing small kisses on the top of Seven's head. Belatedly, Lanna
realized that they weren't alone in the room.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on Seven, we should get you to sickbay to be checked out.&quot;
Lanna was again whispering gently in Seven's ear.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you come with me, Lanna?&quot; Seven asked in a very quiet
childlike voice.</p>

<p>With Seven using B'Elanna's nickname how could she say no. Of course
B'Elanna thought that she would have trouble denying anything to this ex-borg
but that was besides the point. The half-Klingon helped Seven up off the floor
and wrapped her right arm around Seven's waist as she led her out of the
holodeck. The Captain got up slowly feeling like a third wheel at the moment
but chalked it up to the experience Seven just went through. 'After all, Seven
and B'Elanna have gotten close lately so why not ask her to take Seven to
sickbay instead of me. Seven just probably doesn't want me to see her in such a
frail state. I'm sure she'll want to see me later when we can be alone and I
think I'll have a surprise waiting for her.' The Captain rationalized to
herself as she left the holodeck.</p>

<p>It was an hour and a half later when the doctor had finally finished his
work up on Seven and repaired whatever little damage was left from the surge of
energy to her systems. B'Elanna had stayed with Seven offering whatever comfort
she could just by being there. It was a very quiet and somber sickbay when
Janeway entered. The Doctor was in his office cataloging the work up he just did
on Seven. While the other two women stood off to the side waiting for the Doc
to dismiss Seven with a clean bill of health.</p>

<p>&quot;Doctor, how is she?&quot; The Captain asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven is physically fine with no side effects present. Emotionally is
another story. She really was affected by seeing her parents again and
remembering that particular memory for the first time. But she claims that with
an extended period of regeneration she'll be fine. Which may be true
considering this is Seven we are talking about, she deals with her pain and
then moves on but I'd rather her deal with it without the use of regeneration.
I'D prefer if she'd sit down and just talk with someone about what has happened
and allow her emotions time to run their course.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's exactly what I plan to let happen, Doctor. How long can she
postpone her regeneration cycle?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Seven is still pretty weak from the experience but I think that
she'll do fine without regenerating for another few hours or so, maybe even the
night but I'd rather not push it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Doctor.&quot;</p>

<p>And with that the Captain left the office and headed straight for the two
women.</p>

<p>&quot;Captain.&quot; Seven greeted as she saw Janeway head over towards her.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, how are you feeling? Never mind, stupid question I know, don't
answer that. The Doctor said that you are free to go so I was wondering if you
would like to have some dinner with me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Captain... I... &quot; Seven seemed hesitant in answering looking back
and forth between Lanna and Janeway. &quot;I will comply.&quot; Seven finally
answered knowing Janeway only meant well.</p>

<p>&quot;Good. Then let's get out of here unless you need to do something
first.&quot; The Captain didn't comment on Seven's use of borg responses
knowing that she only did that when uncomfortable or stressed. Seven probably
was a little of both after all that had happened.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait! What about her regeneration cycle?&quot; Lanna commented worried
that Seven was not going to get the rest she so desperately needed and wanted.</p>

<p>&quot;The Doctor said that it would be fine if she postponed her cycle for a
few hours, Lt. Not that I would do anything to intentionally hurt Seven.&quot;
The Captain replied frostily not liking B'Elanna's protective streak at all.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven?&quot; The Captain questioned as she held out her arm waiting
for Seven to link her arm through her's.</p>

<p>It was now B'Elanna's turn to realize that she, too, had competition for
Seven's affection. Watching Seven and her captain leave arm in arm only made
the engineer's determination to win Seven over stronger. Little did she know,
she wouldn't have to fight very hard.</p>

<p>In the Captain's quarter, Seven sat on the couch waiting for Katherine to
finish preparing dinner. That's what the Captain had asked Seven to call her
from now on while they were alone. Katherine stepped out of the little
kitchenette carrying two glasses of red wine. Handing one to Seven she sat down
next to her. When Seven gave her that trademark questioning raised eyebrow
Katherine knew she had to explain.</p>

<p>&quot;I know you don't drink alcohol Seven but the synthahol level in this
is very low, so try not to worry too much. Besides after the day you had let
alone the week, I think you need a little help to relax.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed.&quot; Seven agreed as she downed the half filled glass.</p>

<p>From what Seven had remembered from her first experience with alcohol, it
left her with a feeling of euphoria, almost to the point of actually being
happy. And Seven definitely thought that feeling anything other than the way
she was feeling now would be preferable. With the time it had taken Seven to go
down to sickbay and get checked out, she had come to terms with what she had
remembered and felt. After all it was in the past and Seven had an affinity for
being able to put the worst things behind her. It was inefficient to dwell on
the past but that's not what had Seven so upset now. Instead it was only after
the holodeck incident that she began to feel confused and very uncomfortable.
Confused because if she was reading into things correctly, Captain Katherine
Janeway was showing signs of amourous feelings toward Seven. Uncomfortable
because if Katherine was in love with Seven, Seven could not return those
feelings. It was true that Seven did love the Captain but as a mother or
beloved mentor, instead her heart belonged to another. And that's what had Seven
so upset. She didn't want to hurt Katherine but yet she could not betray the
love she felt for B'Elanna Torres. Seven had always felt a special connection
to Lanna; whether Lanna felt it too or not didn't matter. From the very
beginning, Torres managed to make Seven feel. True it was anger, hostility, and
frustration but they were all still human emotions. It took others like the
Captain months to get any emotional response out of her. Lanna made Seven feel
alive and a part of the Voyager collective. Everyone else treated her like the
Captain's pet borg and only tolerated her presence, never accepting it.
B'Elanna on the other hand treated her as an equal, she always spoke her mind,
and wasn't afraid to make it clear that she didn't want Seven there but was
willing to accept it because they needed Seven. Now the Klingon's and borg's
relationship had changed from that of adversaries to friends. And Seven found
that the engineer could inspire other emotions beside anger and frustration.
After the past week and the incident in the holodeck, Seven realized she wanted
their friendship to grow even further, it was only B'Elanna that she ever
wanted to be held by. And Seven thought that Lanna might want the same thing.
She wasn't sure mind you but Seven was more than willing to find out. The only
thing that stood in her way was the Captain. How could she be with B'Elanna
without hurting Katherine? For that she had no answer and Seven's face took on
a crestfallen look while she stared helplessly at the floor. Katherine noticed
the sadness that overcame Seven's normally impassive face and thought that
Seven must still be thinking about her parents. Taking Seven's chin between her
fingers, Katherine pulled Seven's face up until they were looking eye to eye.
Seven's eyes held more emotion than the Captain had ever seen there before but
it was an emotion that she wished never to be shown through the clear blue
eyes. Not really thinking, Katherine couldn't help herself as she leaned into
Seven and touched her lips with hers, wanting to erase some of the pain Seven
was feeling. Of course the synthahol had slowed down Seven's response time but
as soon as she realized what was happening she pulled back. Seven jumped up off
the couch, apologized profusely, and then ran right out of the room.</p>

<p>Seven ran through the corridors, not really seeing where she was going but
unconsciously heading for her own personal safe haven, cargo bay 2. Seven, for
the second time that night, was crying. How could she betray B'Elanna like
that? How could she betray the love she felt for B'Elanna? Now, she feared,
that Lanna would never want to be with her because she had no honor, no respect
for love. Of course, these emotions were all new to Seven and she found it
extremely difficult to sort out all that she felt and thought. Somewhere in
Seven's mind was a voice telling her how illogical, irrational, and irrelevant
her thoughts were. Too bad Seven couldn't think straight to realize this. As
soon as Seven entered cargo bay 2 she realized that she was not alone. Seven
tried to wipe away the tear tracks and pull herself together but it was a
complete waste of time. Even if B'Elanna had not seen the tears she would have
known something was wrong.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, what's wrong?&quot; Lanna cried out as she ran to Seven's side.</p>

<p>&quot;It's... I... uh... she... &quot; Seven couldn't form more than one
word at a time. But that was all B'Elanna needed to hear; 'she'.</p>

<p>&quot;Janeway.&quot; B'Elanna growled as she flew out of the cargo bay like
a targ hunting it's prey.</p>

<p>Seven took a minute or two to finish composing herself and then ran out
after Lanna, hoping that she wouldn't do anything too stupid before Seven
reached her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Captain was cursing up a storm in her quarters. She cursed in
so many different languages that not even the computer could decipher it all.
Just as she had decided to go after Seven, Janeway, literally, bumped into
Chakotay who was sanding in front of her door.</p>

<p>&quot;Commander.&quot; The Captain rushed her greeting as she tried to move
past Chakotay. Unfortunately, Chakotay was having none of it.</p>

<p>&quot;Captain, I just saw Seven run out of your quarters a minute ago. Is
she okay? What happened?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's none of your concern, Commander.&quot; Janeway realized that
sounded a bit harsh so she added, &quot;It's a persona matter.&quot;</p>

<p>Janeway left it at that and turned to continue on down the corridor. Only
she didn't get very far when she was met by a fist. Torres punched Janeway so
had that everyone around could here her nose cracking and see her flying back a
good few feet.</p>

<p>&quot;You, p'tach!&quot; What did you do to Seven!?&quot; B'Elanna screamed
at the top of her lungs while she towered over the fallen Captain.</p>

<p>Chakotay jumped over the bloody mess that was the Captain to come stand
between the two women. Just then Seven came up behind Lanna and grabbed her by
the arms effectively restraining her without hurting her.</p>

<p>&quot;Lanna, please calm down. I am fine. I am the one you should be angry
at not the Captain.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven tried to calm the Klingon down and to some degree she did but it was
all for nothing as the chef of security came upon the group. With the raise of
his eyebrow he was able to question everyone present without saying a word.</p>

<p>&quot;Lt. Tuvok, I want to press formal charges against Lt. B'Elanna Torres
for assaulting her captain. Place her in the brig until such time as I can
figure out a proper punishment for her.&quot; The Captain order through a very
nasal voice as Chakotay helped her up off the floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Why you bitch! You're the one that hurt Seven and I'm the one going to
the brig?&quot; Torres fumed.</p>

<p>&quot;Lt., I want her out of my sight.&quot; Janeway screamed back.</p>

<p>Chakotay nodded his head in agreement but only because the engineer did
assault someone. Though he did have a feeling that there was more to this
story. Besides it might be better to keep Lanna locked up until this mess gets
straightened out. Seven followed Tuvok as he led Lanna away, unwilling to leave
her love alone while she stayed in the brig.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, Captain. Let's have you looked at.&quot; Chakotay refered to
the broken nose as he led Janeway to sickbay.</p>

</table>

<p>The following morning Lt. Tuvok finally allowed visitors in the brig. Last
night Seven was unable to accompany B'Elanna inside the brig for some security
reason. But none the less she camped out outside the brig waiting to be allowed
in. Neither woman had heard form the Captain since the night before but no one
could tell if that was a good thing or bad. When Seven finally entered the brig
she saw only one guard who stood unobtrusively off to the side going over some
data. Lanna herself sat in one of the cells on the bunk with her face in her
hands. Seven gave a slight nod of acknowledgement to the guard as she walked
past. She stopped and stood in front of the force field that separated her from
her love.</p>

<p>&quot;Lanna?&quot; Seven whispered sounding almost afraid to speak.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven?&quot; Lanna jumped off her bunk at the sound of the most
angelic voice she had ever heard. &quot;How are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am... functioning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How are you really feeling?&quot; B'Elanna asked not at all fooled.</p>

<p>&quot;I miss you. And I am sorry that this happened to you.&quot; Seven
whispered, only able to tell the truth to this woman.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, are you in love with me?&quot; B'Elanna had to ask even though
she feared the worst. It could have been that Lanna had read too much into
their relationship and Seven was going to tell her so. Seven was going to say
she was in love with Janeway and that her answer would be....</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; Was the only answer Seven could think to say.</p>

<p>&quot;What?!&quot; Lanna had to make sure she was hearing things right.</p>

<p>&quot;I said yes. I love you Lt. B'Elanna Torres.&quot; Seven declared with
a surety and bravery that she did not feel.</p>

<p>&quot;Then I'm not sorry for anything that has happened recently. I'm not
sorry for hitting the Captain. I'm not sorry for letting you explain things.
And least of all, I'm not sorry for loving you back.&quot; Seven seemed to
bring the romantic side out of anyone including half Klingons.</p>

<p>&quot;But I am sorry for... You love me back?&quot; Seven caught on late but
smiled the biggest smile anyone had ever seen on the ex-drone's face when she
realized what Lanna had said.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; The only answer possible for Torres was a simple one.
&quot;I love you.&quot;</p>

<p>Both she and Seven were now standing at the force field. B'Elanna had put
her hand up against the force field palm facing out and Seven had unconsciously
mimicked the action.</p>

<p>&quot;But how can you love me when I betrayed our love with Katherine?&quot;
Seven asked in hushed tones.</p>

<p>&quot;You slept with the Captain?!&quot; B'Elanna said a little too loudly,
then repeated it softer. &quot;You had sex with the Captain?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, but I did kiss her.&quot; Seven admitted reluctantly</p>

<p>&quot;Wait. Something just doesn't add up. If you say you love me and you're
not the type of person to go around kissing others I can't imagine you just
kissing the Captain. Did by any chance the Captain initiate the kiss?&quot;
Lanna began to get the picture.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but I allowed her to kiss me for 1 minute and 48 seconds before I
fled her quarters.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then it's settled. You didn't betray me or our love. If I'm not
mistaken, you do have strong feelings for the Captain even if it's not love.
And because of these strong feelings you were reluctant to hurt her. I would
guess that being new to these types of situations and feelings you were unsure
of how to act when the Captain kissed you. You knew that if you pulled away you
would hurt her feelings but if you continued to kiss her you would hurt me. Did
you want to kiss her?&quot; B'Elanna was better at these emotional talks than
she thought.</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot; Seven adamantly denied.</p>

<p>&quot;Then I understand and don't blame you for what happened. In fact I now
wish the Captain would come pay me a visit so that I could truly tell her what
I think of her for taking advantage of you like that. The Captain should not
have put you in that position. &quot; Lanna's protective streak was rearing i's
head again.</p>

<p>&quot;But perhaps the Captain did not know how I truly felt about her and
wished to determine where our relationship stood.&quot; Seven couldn't help but
defend her friend and mentor.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, I think it's time you had a little talk with Janeway to
explain exactly where she does stand. I wouldn't want to have to kill Janeway
AND Paris. And don't you think for one second I forgot about Paris being
responsible for you getting hurt in the holodeck. He's just lucky I hadn't
bumped into him yet because when I do, he's getting bumped right out an
airlock.&quot; B'Elanna concluded leaving Seven hoping that she could talk to
Janeway and Paris before Lanna did. Because spending the rest of 'their' lives
in the brig would be an inefficient use of time.</p>

<p>&quot;I will go talk with the Captain. I will explain to her my feelings for
you and see that she drops the imprisonment sentence. Holding you in the brig
indefinitely seems a bit harsh for the circumstances.&quot; 'Then I will speak
will Lt. Paris.' Seven thought but dared not say it allowed.</p>

<p>Seven spun on her heals and charged out of the brig before Lanna could say
goodbye.</p>

<p>&quot;Now there's a woman on a mission.&quot; Lanna smiled her comment to
the guard on duty. &quot;I just hope that she doesn't get thrown in here with
me for upsetting the Captain. On second thought, that might not be such a bad
idea.&quot; Lanna now knew how to spend her time in prison; thinking of what it
would be like locked up with that beautiful, statuesque woman.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, outside the brig, stood Tom Paris and Lt. Tuvok arguing. Well,
at least Tom was arguing while Tuvok stood there impassively listening.</p>

<p>&quot;Damn it, Tuvok. I want to go in and see Lanna. I want to see if she's
alright. Only I know that she hates confined place and that she needs
comfort.&quot; Tom thought he was the only one who knew forgetting that Tuvok
once served in the maquis with her.</p>

<p>&quot;She appears to be cooping well with the circumstances, Lt. I recently
checked on Lt. Torres and ascertained that she is physically and emotionally
stable.&quot; Tuvok answered calmly not showing how truly irritated he was
becoming.</p>

<p>&quot;But Tuvok, 'I' need to see her. I guess being Vulcan with no emotions
limits you from understanding that I still do have feelings for Lanna. And I
know she still feels something for me. She needs me and I need to see
her.&quot; Tom tried explaining his love to an emotionless Vulcan.</p>

<p>Just then Seven comes barrelling out of the brig almost knocking Paris on
his ass. Fortunately for him Seven still needed him alive so they could have
their little talk. But first she needed to straighten things out with the
Captain. Leaving the two men with an acknowledging, &quot;Lt's.&quot;, Seven
continued on her way.</p>

<p>&quot;You let HER in to see Lanna and not me?!&quot; Paris raged on.
&quot;You won't let me in to help B'Elanna calm down but you let that borg drone
in only to upset poor Lanna more?!&quot;</p>

<p>Now instead of becoming irritable, Tuvok was becoming a little worried (as
much as Vulcans can worry). Either Tom was blind or he was beginning to have
delusions. Which ever it was, Tuvok was seriously considering bringing Tom down
to see the Doctor.</p>

<p>&quot;If you must know, I allowed Seven in to see Lt. Torres because the Lt.
had requested it. I was inclined to allow it because this situation does
involve Seven of Nine. But because the Lt. did not request to see you nor does
this involve you in anyway, I see no reason to allow the visit.&quot; Tuvok
didn't mention that he thought Tom would only aggravate the situation even
more. Nor did he mention that he violated the Captain's orders of allowing no
visitors and was not about to do so again for Tom's sake. Tuvok made a command
decision that allowing Seven to see B'Elanna might help the situation resolve
itself. He also did not agree with the way the Captain was handling the
incident.</p>

<p>&quot;What?! It's all about Seven isn't it? I bet you anything that it's
because of Seven that Lanna landed in the brig. Why don't you go and ask Lanna
if she wants to see me and then you can just let me in when she says yes. Don't
worry, I'll wait right here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Paris, you will be waiting a long time as I now have other duties
to attend to. When I go see Lt. Torres again I will be sure to relay the
message.&quot; Tuvok said right before he turned and left Paris standing
behind. Tuvok just hoped that Seven appreciated everything he was doing for
her. Even though he hated getting involved in human affairs, he did look upon
Seven as a daughter and that meant he would do anything for her, even get
involved in love quarrels.</p>

<p>Walking the corridors and then riding in the turbolift, Seven found herself
with lots of time to think. Well, lots of time for someone with enhanced brain
function. Seven found that most of her feelings and thoughts had been resolved
after the talk she had with Lanna. No longer did she feel worried that her
feelings of affection would not be returned. No longer was she afraid of
rejection or being made a fool of. True she still felt the tingles in the
stomach, the speeding up of her heart, and the light-headedness when around
Lanna but those were all pleasant feelings. Now she only had one thing left to
worry about and that was how to resolve the issue of Captain Janeway without
hurting her. Perhaps, Seven thought, it would have been best if she paid a
visit to the Doctor first before seeking out Janeway. Unfortunately Seven had
that last thought just as the turbolift doors opened up on the bridge. With a
renewed determination, Seven exited the lift and upon not seeing Janeway
present headed straight for her ready room.</p>

<p>The Captain was sitting at her desk with her head in her hands. After the
incident last night and being checked out by the Doctor, Janeway wanted to talk
with Seven, to apologize and explain things. But every time the Captain asked
where Seven was the computer gave the same response, 'Seven of Nine is located
directly outside the brig'. It appeared that Seven always kept in close
proximity to the brig because not once did the computer reply that Seven was on
deck 8 section 14. After hearing the computer reply that same damned answer ten
times over, in a period of two hours, the Captain found that even if she tried
to fall asleep she wouldn't be able to. So she ended up in her ready room,
wondering when exactly she had lost Seven to B'Elanna. But did she really have
Seven to begin with? The Captain knew that Seven must have stayed near the brig
the entire night and into the morning because she did check on Seven's location
every once in a while. Although the last time the Captain did check on Seven it
was five in the morning. She just couldn't take hearing that cold voice reply once
again that Seven was near the brig.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, that Janeway was surprised to find Seven coming through
the ready room doors unannounced. Some things never change and Janeway was
thankful for that. Her slight smile faltered at Seven's first words to her.</p>

<p>&quot;Captain, may we sit at your couch?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Back to Captain already, Seven? Have I hurt you that much?&quot;
Katherine asked as she led Seven over to the couch.</p>

<p>&quot;Captain, I can not lie to you because I still do care and respect you.
You have hurt me even though I know you did not mean to just as I do not wish
to hurt you but I fear I will. Unfortunately, you must hear what I have to say
so that no one else will get hurt needlessly. Recently, I have come to realize
that I am in love with B'Elanna Torres long before I even understood what love
was. When you kissed me I felt like I had betrayed the love I have for Lanna.
Captain, Katherine, I do respect you, admire you, and think of you as my only
family but I can not give you my heart because it already belongs to
another.&quot;</p>

<p>By the end of her emotional outpouring, Seven had realized that she now held
the Captain's hands in her own. Seven was all new to this but figured that she
was just going on instinct. Katherine had one or two tear drops sliding down
her face as she tried to control the overwhelming sense of being too late and
losing something very special.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure what you feel for B'Elanna is love?&quot; Katherine had
to ask though her voice sounded rough from all the emotions she was so
desperately trying to contain.</p>

<p>&quot;Because, Katherine, after all my research into the subject of love and
analyzing the data I collected on human mating rituals I still was unable to
figure out a proper definition of what love is. It was not until I began to
analyze my thoughts and feelings for B'Elanna that I was able to put words to
the emotion of love. For me love is the lonely feeling I feel when not around
Lanna despite being in a crowded room. Love is the 'butterflies in the stomach'
feeling I get when I am around Lanna. Love is being able to forgive Lanna for
being the one single person on this ship who has hurt me the most. Love is the
understanding I give Lanna when I can not comprehend what she means. Love is
being able to listen to Lanna when she has anything to say at anytime. Love is
the unconditional love I can give to Lanna even during the times I hate her.
Love is the opposite of hate and I do not hate Lanna therefore I must love her.
I love B'Elanna Torres with all that I am and all that I am not. She is my perfection,
my omega molecule. I love her intelligence, her dry wit, her dedication, her
loyalty, her passion, but I also love her temper, her impulsiveness, her
aggression, her attitude, and her protective streak no matter how unnecessary
it is. I love the good and the bad. It is not something that happened it is
just something that is.&quot;</p>

<p>If Katherine had any doubts about Seven not being emotionally ready or not
having the understanding of complex human emotions, she was wrong and she
certainly had none now. Janeway was so moved by the empowered speech that she
no longer felt it worth a fight to tear B'Elanna and Seven apart. In truth,
Katherine only wanted to have Seven happy and if being with Torres was what would
make her happy then who was Janeway to stand in the way. The Captain was
willing to let Seven go and settle with just being friends or even family to
Seven but none the less Katherine knew she had lost something very precious,
something she would regret losing for the rest of her life.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven are you sure you never assimilated a poet because you could very
well pass for one.&quot; The Captain said even as she had fresh tears sliding
down her cheeks, moved beyond words from Seven's speech on love.</p>

<p>&quot;If I did Captain, his knowledge would have been deemed irrelevant and
discarded.&quot; Seven replied. Even though she knew Katherine was joking,
Seven wanted to make sure that she understood that this is what she felt not a
poet or anyone else.</p>

<p>&quot;I understand Seven. I want you to know that although I am sorry for
the pain I have caused you, I can not be sorry for loving you. I know that you
can not love me back but I do hope that we can remain friends. I only want you
to be happy and if B'Elanna makes you happy then I wish you both the best of
luck.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven took Katherine's face in her hands and leaned in to place a chaste
kiss on the other woman's lips.</p>

<p>&quot;I am sorry that this is hurting you but I am glad that we can still
remain friends.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Always, Seven, always.&quot; The Captain wrapped her arms around the
borg turned human basking in being able to hold her love close even if it was
only a platonic hug.</p>

<p>&quot;Captain, there is another matter I wish to speak with you about.&quot;
Seven said as she backed slightly away from Katherine leaving her hoping that
the worst was already over. It is about B'Elanna's imprisonment.&quot;</p>

<p>Janeway jumped up off the couch and began to pace the ready room floor. 'Now
Seven wants to talk about Torres being in prison?' After all it was B'Elanna
who stole Seven from me and then hit me, a commanding officer, for it.'
Apparently, Seven surmised that this was a sore point for the proud Captain.</p>

<p>&quot;You want me to release her from the brig, don't you Seven? Well, I
can't do that. After all she did commit a crime and must be punished
accordingly.&quot; Janeway's temper began to rise.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not wish for you to release B'Elanna from prison but as you have
said it yourself, she must be punished accordingly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you insinuating that I am not dealing with this situation
appropriately?&quot; If Seven thought Klingon tempers were bad she hasn't seen
anything yet.</p>

<p>&quot;I...&quot; Seven was thankfully interrupted by the chime to the door.</p>

<p>Seven had never had a reason to sigh from relief before but there was a
first time for everything. Janeway called for whoever to enter and in walks
Tuvok. Janeway had to wonder about his timing.</p>

<p>&quot;Tuvok. What can I do for you?&quot; The Captain tried to school her
temper.</p>

<p>&quot;I need to discuss a security matter with you, Captain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can this wait?&quot; Janeway wanted to finish her conversation with
Seven.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I'm afraid not.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright. Seven you're dismissed but I would like to continue our
little talk at a later time.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven nodded to both officers after being dismissed and walked out of the
room. As Seven walked across the bridge all eyes were trained on her. Stopping
right in front of the aft engineering station, even turned to Chakotay who
stood in front of the Captain's chair.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you Commander. Although you are human you're timing is
impeccable. I would have preferred a minute sooner but I am grateful for the
interruption none the less.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anytime, Seven, anytime.&quot; Chakotay smiled realizing that he
couldn't put anything past the borg not even a minor planned interruption.</p>

<p>Seven continued on her way into the turbolift left with only one more errand
to run. She left a very quiet but smirking bridge crew behind.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back in the Captain's ready room, Tuvok and the Captain were
heatedly talking about Lt. Torres's imprisonment. Tuvok logically pointed out
that the Captain was too emotionally involved causing an over reaction on her
part. Tuvok pointed out that the punishment does not fit the crime and that
only a five day incarceration and a reprimand noted in the computer logs would
suffice. Also the no visitors command was a bit extreme and Tuvok managed to
talk Janeway into agreeing to change the punishment. Just as soon as Janeway
agreed, Tuvok noted the change in status of the prisoner in the computer logs.
Unfortunately, Tom also caught wind of the change almost immediately and set
off to finally go see B'Elanna.</p>

<p>Tom was in the mess-hall pouring over some sort of data on a pad. This was
the first time most of the crew had ever seen Tom so studious, so they decided
to leave him to his work. Actually, Tom could be very studious, but only when
the purpose served him and this time was no different. On the data pad was the
current information regarding the arrest and imprisonment of B'Elanna Torres.
Tom figured that since he wasn't able to see B'Elanna then he'd have to be the
knight in shinning armor coming to her rescue. Tom was looking for a loop hole
in which to get Lanna out of the brig when he noticed a change. The status of
the prisoner went from no visitors to visitors allowed. Now Tom didn't need
Tuvok's permission to go see Lanna and he wondered why he was still in the
mess-hall with some stupid pad. Paris jumped up from his seat and headed out of
the mess-hall, plan of freeing Lanna forgotten. Stepping into the turbolift,
Tom ordered the lift to deck 3 (crew's quarters) instead of deck 8 (the brig).
Tom needed to pick up something from his quarters because he had a plan to put
into effect when he went to visit B'Elanna. Did anyone really expect Tom to
just pop in on Lanna and say hi? No Tom had something special planned for his
little visit.</p>

<p>About five minutes after Paris had left the mess-hall, Seven of Nine walked
in. She scanned the crowd obviously looking for something but when she didn't
find it she questioned the computer.</p>

<p>&quot;Computer locate Tom Paris.&quot; Seven ordered with something that
resembled a sigh.</p>

<p>&quot;Tom Paris is in his quarters.&quot; The computer replied nonplussed.</p>

<p>Seven upon hearing the answer, turned and left the mess-hall once again in
search of Lt. Tom Paris.</p>

<p>Tom gathered up what he needed rather quickly, and immediately left his
quarters heading straight for the brig. Little did he know, he had an ex-drone
looking for him and that he certainly didn't want her to find him in the brig.</p>

<p>Tom quickly made his way to the brig and almost ran right through the doors
in his excitement. Inside the brig, stood the one guard and the one active cell
B'Elanna was in. Paris walked right up to the guard, announcing that he was
here to visit with Lanna. This of course not only got the attention of the
guard, but also that of B'Elanna's who immediately stood up and went as close
to the force field as possible. Torres let off a low growl and began to beg
Kahless to cause the force field to all of a sudden fail. Tom noticed none of
this as he was too busy taking in hushed tones with the guard putting his plan
to work.</p>

<p>&quot;Ensign, I know this is against the rules and regulations but I want to
be allowed into the cell with Lanna. I know what you're going to say but how
about I just give you this pad full of holographic porn to look at. And then
when to turn your back you won't be able to see me lower the force field and
step into the cell with Lanna. I promise you this is not an escape attempt and
that even if Tuvok were to find out about this it wouldn't be a problem.&quot;</p>

<p>Ensign Harvey Padmore was not a man for breaking the rules. No one under
Tuvok's command was. Nor was he a man that actually enjoyed holographic porn.
It was just dirty. Ensign Padmore also knew that if he lowered the force fields
and allow Lt. Paris to enter the cell, it would be like signing Tom's death
warrant. But none of that mattered as Padmore took the pad and turned around.
The ensign had very little respect for Tom and liked him even less. Paris
treated all the crewmen under him like second class citizens. Tom thought he
was above them and even acted like it sometimes. Harvey thought, no he knew,
that Thomas Eugene Paris needed to be taught a lesson.</p>

<p>When the guard had turned his back, Tom leaned over the control panel and
pressed a few buttons. One of the cells did open, but it wasn't the right one.
Paris realized he was looking at the controls upside down and probably pressed
a few wrong buttons. He looked over at Lanna and shrugged his shoulders while
Lanna just stood there, waiting with a feral smile on her face. Just as he was
about to correct his mistake, Seven walked into the brig. When Seven had found
out that Tom was now located in the brig she became very angry. Now upon seeing
what Tom was trying to do, Seven became furious. She stalked towards Tom,
forcing him to walk backwards toward the cell that was now open. No one,
including Tom, could see just how furious Seven was. Lanna may not have been
able to see the change in emotion, but she of all people knew when Seven was
ready to blow a fuse. Ensign Padmore still had his back to the group but now he
had a huge smile on his face. Seven backed Tom all the way into the cell that
he had previously opened and followed him in.</p>

<p>Harvey then 'accidentally' leaned back on the controls pressing a few key
buttons that effectively brought the force field on-line. Now Tom was trapped
in the cell with Seven of Nine, and if he thought that Lanna was the most
dangerous person on the ship, he had another thing coming.</p>

<p>&quot;Lt. Paris, explain your actions.&quot;</p>

<p>'God and I thought the Captain could cut duranium with her voice.' Tom
thought as a sudden wave of fear enveloped him.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,... I... uh..., hey, not that it's any of your business but I
wanted to visit with Lanna. Not that you would understand but even after we
broke up I still cared for her and I know she still feels the same for
me.&quot; Tom was now angry that this ex-borg could frighten him let alone
question what he was planning with B'Elanna. So instead of being smart he lashed
out against Seven the only way he could and that was through verbal attacks.</p>

<p>&quot;What?!&quot; Lanna couldn't keep quiet any longer. &quot;I do not
still care for you. The only feelings I have towards you are feelings of
hatred. You convinced the captain that the holodecks were safe to use and
therefore I hold you personally responsible for what happened to Seven and all
the hurt you caused her. You hurt her in more ways than you can even
comprehend. And for hurting the woman that I love, the only thing I plan to do
with you, is to kill you, you p'tach. You better count your lucky stars that
you ended up in that cell with Seven instead of in here with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're in love with Seven, the Borg ice queen? How could you betray
what we have with this thing?&quot; Tom kept throwing insults at Seven,
realizing that he was pretty safe. Seven wouldn't disregard protocol unless she
felt it necessary and she wouldn't hit him because it was just an inefficient
use of energy. But what Tom didn't know was that Seven was more than willing to
play his game.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, she is in love with me. Perhaps she finds being with the Borg ice
queen preferable to being with you.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom lost it after that. He wasn't prepared for Seven to insult his manhood
and grew enraged because of it. Tom tried to throw a punch which Seven blocked
easily but that was all that she was waiting for. Now that the first punch had
been thrown with more on their way, Seven, using her fully human, took a good
slug at Tom's face. Even though Seven's hand was human, she still did possess a
great amount of strength. Tom's lip cracked open and began to bleed while Seven
heard his cheek bone cracking. Seven could have used her Borg enhanced hand and
caused a lot more damage, but she wouldn't have gotten the same satisfaction
she did by punching Tom with her human hand. Still, Tom tried to take another
swing at Seven but she retaliated with a knee to the groin. Tom collapsed to
the floor moaning in pain, but at least he was no longer a threat (as if he
ever was one). Seven looked over to where B'Elanna stood in her cell stunned.
Her mouth was agape and her eyes were wide. But what caught Seven's attention
was that Lanna's eyes were darting back and forth between the cell she was in
and the door to the brig. When Seven turned to look at who was standing at the
door to the brig, she almost rolled her eyes, almost. Of course, Captain
Janeway and Lt. Tuvok would come walking into the brig just in time to see
Seven having it out with Paris. Janeway ordered the guard to lower the force
field and allowed Seven to step out. As soon as she was clear, Janeway ordered
the force field up again leaving Tom in there huddled on the floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Either you are a very lucky woman, Seven of Nine, or you're smarter
than we ever gave you credit for. You managed to play Paris's insult game and
then turned the tables on him. You managed to get him to swing first and can
defend your actions by saying you were only defending yourself. You also
managed to avoid the charge of excessive force when defending yourself by only
using your human hand instead of your Borg enhancements. Bravo. I'm going to
have a little chat with Lt. Torres about her sentence change. Tuvok, you can
handle this assault case.&quot; Janeway left the two and headed for Lanna's
cell.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven of Nine. As the captain has stated I can not bring you up on any
charges and neither can Mr. Paris. However, you can file charges against the
Lt. for attempted assault.&quot; Tuvok stated his question.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I do not want to file charges. I believe that Mr. Paris has
finally come to an understanding and has learned a valuable lesson in the
process. I do respectfully request that Mr. Paris be escorted down to sickbay
to be looked at and given a time to 'cool down'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is acceptable. I will escort Mr. Paris myself after I have a discussion
with Ensign Padmore.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lt., belay that discussion. I think that the Ensign understands what
he did here was wrong and that he shouldn't let it happen again. Because if it
does, then he will be cleaning the Jeffries tubes the next time we need a guard
to watch a prisoner. Is that clear enough for you,Ensign?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, ma'am.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good. Tuvok, why don't you take Mr. Paris down to sickbay now and then
when the Doctor is finished fixing him up please escort him to my ready
room.&quot;</p>

<p>Tuvok left with a nod, following Tom out of the brig. Janeway then dismissed
Seven, stating that B'Elanna was a prisoner after all and visiting hours were
over. After Seven left, Janeway walked over to the force field holding Lanna
inside her cell. She still had one more thing she wanted to say to the Lt.</p>

<p>&quot;Lt. Torres, I wanted you to know that although I'm none too happy with
the fact that you punched a superior officer, let alone me, I don't personally
hold it against you. I might have done the same thing if our places were
reversed. I just have one question for you. What's your favorite number?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?!&quot; Torres was surprised to still be in the good graces of
her captain after all that's happened but she was dumbfounded as to why this
woman wanted to know her favorite number.</p>

<p>&quot;You're favorite number Lt., between 1 and 35. You do have one
right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Umm, yes. It's 23. Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because if you ever end up intentionally hurting Seven, then I will
personally throw you out of airlock number 23.&quot;</p>

<p>And the captain left B'Elanna to contemplate that little tid bit.</p>

<p>According to the old Earth calendar, not only was it four days later and
B'Elanna's release date but it was also Dec. 25, Christmas Day. Neither Tuvok
nor the Captain had planned it that way but it turned out to be a nice
Christmas present for Lanna. Seven had been by to visit only once and that was
the day before. It seemed that with B'Elanna locked up in the brig Seven now
had double the work load. Not only did she have her duties in astrometrics but
now she had to pick up the slack in engineering left by the absence of it's
chief engineer. This left Lanna with plenty of time to think. The engineer
thought about how complete and how happy her life was now. Not only did she
have her family and friends around her in a place that she could truly call
home but now she had found the love of her life. But Seven hadn't been the only
visitor that Torres had received. Two days before, Neelix had showed up to
check on the reclusive half Klingon. He had asked about how she was doing which
was to be expected but what wasn't expected was when he asked what B'Elanna was
getting Seven for Christmas. Of course it had to be something big but what do
you get an ex-borg for Christmas. Neelix made a couple of suggestions but
nothing seemed just right. So finally he just suggested going around to the
rest of the crew collecting replicator rations form everyone and leaving the
final decision up to Lanna. Neelix rationalized that the rest of the crew still
owed Seven a gift and if B'Elanna finally decided on something he was sure it
was going to be big and expensive. Thank Kahless, Lanna had to spend four days
in the brig other wise she may never have come up with an idea for Seven's
gift.</p>

<p>Torres was scheduled to leave the brig at 1300 hours, right in the middle of
the alpha shift. The only person she might have expected to see at that time
was Seven of Nine. But thanks to a friendly Vulcan in engineering she was
almost guaranteed that Seven would be kept busy. Thanks, of course, to a few
logical distractions which Seven could not turn away from. In fact, that same
friendly Vulcan also guaranteed that Seven would be kept busy for the next
three hours of her shift and then one extra hour after that all with the help
of a few other friends. Now Lanna just had to make sure she set up her gift for
Seven in time. Her first stop was the mess-hall, to pick up the pad of rations
Neelix promised to get her. Then it was on to the Cargo Bay.</p>

<p>Arriving at the Cargo bay, B'Elanna's first order of business was to get rid
of Icheb. She sent him to go see the Captain, who would keep him busy for quite
a while (her Christmas gift to Seven). Next it was onto decorating the bay.
Lanna took a page from Seven's book and replicated a whole lot of Christmas
decorations. Using red bows and silver garlands, the engineer decorated the
bare walls. Mingled in were Christmas balls of all colours and gold tinsel
thrown about. A christmas tree already stood off to the side, replicated and
decorated by Icheb (his gift to Seven). The next order of business was to get
Chakotay and Harry to carry in a small couch and small coffee table retrieved
from storage. Lanna set up the couch in front of the dais and placed the table
in front of that. Next the engineer brought in a small cardboard fireplace
created and designed by Sam Wildman, the Doc, and Naomi. That was placed
directly across form the couch. The fireplace may not have been real but it
certainly brought a more homey look to the Cargo Bay. Then Lanna had to
replicate a few presents for Seven and when that was done she set them down
under the coffee table just waiting to be opened. There was now less then a
half an hour left and a few minor additions to be made. That's when Neelix
showed up with young Naomi in tow. Neelix handed over the plate full of
Christmas cookies he made just the way B'Elanna had instructed him to. Naomi
handed over a children's version of the Christmas classic A Christmas Carole by
Charles Dickens. But before Neelix or the little Katarian could ask any
questions Lanna quickly escorted them out of the bay.</p>

<p>Just as the Lt. had made some of the final adjustments Seven walked into
what used to be her Cargo Bay. Seven had realized that something was up
throughout her entire engineering shift. The way everyone was overly friendly
towards her and trying to distract her by engaging her in idle conversations.
Even though Seven knew they were distractions, she didn't know how to stop them
not being as socially adept as she wished she was. But what really bothered her
was the knowing smirks everyone kept giving her like they were keeping her out
of some sort of secret that everyone else knew about but her. Walking into the
bay she now knew what everything was all about. To say Seven was shocked was an
understatement. Even though Seven had done something similar for the crew it
had been all a holgraphic fantasy but this was all real.</p>

<p>&quot;How?... Why?...&quot; Was all Seven could squeak out.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, the decorating was easy and thanks to the crew, done just the
way I envisioned it. But tying to figure out a perfect Christmas gift for you
was something else.&quot; Lanna said as she walked over to the couch. Both
women sat down and B'Elanna leaned over to give Seven a quick kiss on the lips.
&quot;Merry Christmas Seven.&quot; Seven looked up to see where the mistletoe
was but this time she didn't find any. Lanna just smiled. &quot;As for the why,
well, because you deserve it more than anyone I know. While you were able to
give the crew a Christmas they would never forget you neglected to make this
Christmas special for you. I made a promise to myself then to make this your
first happy and memorable Christmas. So how about we open your presents.&quot;
Lanna concluded feeling foolish for saying too much.</p>

<p>Seven nodded and picked up the first present. As she opened it Lanna
explained what it was and why she was giving it to the ex-drone. &quot;That
there are three picture frames. In each frame is a picture of your new
collective or family. The first being the Captain who saved you from the
collective and who was the first to trust in you. The second is of Naomi who
has now become such a constant, loving, and loyal friend to you. And the third
being Icheb, the latest edition to your family unit.&quot; Seven then picked up
the next box to open as B'Elanna took away the pictures and placed them on the
table. &quot;These here are empty picture frames which you can add pictures to
as your family grows. Open that next box there. That's a, umm, picture of me. I
was hoping that soon you'd like to add that to your collection of
pictures.&quot; Lanna finished shyly.</p>

<p>&quot;Lanna, that should have been the first picture you placed in a frame.
You are the love of my life and the person I wish to now build my family
around. I love you. Thank you.&quot; Seven leaned over and placed one of the
most softest, sweetest kisses on Lanna's lips. The Lt. now had one of the most
goofiest grins on her face but continued on anyway.</p>

<p>&quot;Someone had mentioned to me recently how much they love it when you
sign them to sleep so I thought that this children's song book might come in
handy.&quot; Lanna had to clear her throat before explaining the next gift.
&quot;It's a, a book on Klingon Human mating. I was kind of hoping that one
would come in handy as well.&quot; Lanna finished in a rush.</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed.&quot; And that confession deserved a passion filled kiss
delivered from Seven's heart directly to Lanna's leaving her feeling
light-headed and breathless. &quot;Thank you Lanna for already making this
Christmas a happy and special one for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, it's not over yet.&quot; Lanna moved the presents out of the way
and reached over the table to grab the plate full of cookies handing it to
Seven. &quot;Here, try this. Trust me. It tastes great, I taste tested it
before you came in.&quot; Lanna then sat laying across the couch pulling Seven
to lean back into her wrapping her arms around the ex-borg. Seven tried the
cookies and in one moment realised the pleasures of taste. Lanna then reached
over and grabbed the book that lay on the table.</p>

<p>&quot;There's milk there to wash down the cookies if you want. And now for
my last gift to you. This here is a Christmas classic. A book called A
Christmas Carole by Charles Dickens. I believe that everyone at the academy was
required to read this but I was introduced to this by my father. One Christmas
day he took me in his lap just like this and told me he was going to read this
story to me. We read a few chapters that Christmas and then a few more the next.
It became sort of a Christmas tradition between us. But I never got to finish
the book because he soon there after left us. I was never inclined to pick it
up again, too many memories I guess but now I think I might want to continue
that tradition with you. That is if you wouldn't mind me reading to you. I'd
like to find out how this ends right along with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Please.&quot; Seven whispered squeezing Lanna' hand to reassure her
that this was the best idea for a gift she could ever ask for.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright then. A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens....&quot;</p>

<p>And so B'Elanna began to read to Seven the Christmas classic beginning a new
tradition between the two women that both were determined to see through to the
end.</p>
