<!-- Trick or Treat \ Part 4 -->

<p>A second staff meeting in as many days had been called and again the senior
staff met without some of their co-workers present.</p>

<p>&quot;So why had Seven relapsed?&quot; Janeway shot a force ten glare at the
doctor.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Captain. It... uh.. seems she didn't relapse. She just never
fully recovered.&quot; The Doctor managed to stutter out. &quot;It seems that
during the day, Seven returned to her normal self but it was during the night
that she turned into a vampire.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But we don't even have night and day on this ship.&quot; Torres nearly
screamed out.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it seems that it only takes simulated light to effect what ever
virus is causing this. I really can't even explain why Seven might shy away
from the artificial light when she is a vampire. It's as if she was programmed
to do so, not so much that it is a natural aversion. And the only explanation I
could come up with as to why Seven changes back and forth is because she's not
a full vampire. She hasn't drunk anyone's blood yet. Right?&quot;</p>

<p>That last question was directed at B'Elanna for which she nodded her
agreement and then seemed to turn a light shade pink. The entire senior staff
now knew that for some reason Seven kept coming after her and for an even odder
reason B'Elanna wasn't complaining. The Captain reminded herself that she
certainly had to ask a few questions after this whole ordeal was over.</p>

<p>Speaking of this whole ordeal, they were still no closer to finding out what
was going on, how, why, or even a cure for this mess which made the Captain a very
frustrated Captain.</p>

<p>&quot;Doctor, what do you plan to do now?&quot; Tuvok asked, trying to keep
the conversation on track.</p>

<p>&quot;The only thing I can do is keep them under quarantine and sedated
until I can come up with a way to cure them. There's nothing else I can do for
them. And even with Seven, I don't think it's a good idea to have her roaming
around the ship during the day even if she is her normal self during that
time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, you can't do that. You're spoiling all my fun. Kathy, tell him he
can't do that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Q.&quot; Janeway jumped out of her seat to glare at the man now
standing directly behind her chair. &quot;We haven't seen you for a while,
should have known you would have gotten bored by now and decide to cause
trouble for us, again.&quot;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Janeway's level ten glare doesn't work on arrogant omnipotent
beings.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,.. yeah. And with this whole idea of Halloween and stuff I
thought it was a perfect way to come back in style. I thought it would be fun
to watch some of my old friends turn into what they pretended to be. Too bad
you changed out of your costume a little to early. It was after all quite
entertaining to watch, especially that Seven of Nine.&quot; Q said with a
wiggle of his eyebrows.</p>

<p>&quot;Why you, p'tach!&quot; Torres screamed as she jumped over the table to
grab Q only to land flat on her face as he disappeared and then reappeared at
the other end of the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Q, you had your fun and now the game is over whether or not you like
it. I will not release the affected crew members from sickbay until you cure
them. Your entertainment for the evening is over.&quot; Janeway managed through
gritted teeth as the others tried to hold Torres down.</p>

<p>Q had realized that his game was over the minute he appeared and so with one
way of his hand a bright light engulfed the ship again, blinding everyone for a
few seconds. As soon as the Captain regained her sight she looked to see where
Q was and as expected he was gone.</p>

<p>&quot;You win this time, Kathy but just remember, I get bored very
easily.&quot; The disembodied voice of Q carried over.</p>

<p>&quot;Great, just my luck&quot; the Captain mumbled. &quot;Doctor, go check
on your patients. I have a strange feeling they're completely healed right
about now&quot; she said in a stronger voice.</p>

<p>Both the Doctor and B'Elanna rushed out the door with Harry hot on their
heels. The Captain just slumped in her chair while Tuvok stood next to her.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think someday we could ever have a party or day off without
strange side effects occurring?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;While we remain in the Delta Quadrant, it is... unlikely.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed.&quot; Janeway smiled her agreement, &quot;Only in the Delta
Quadrant.&quot;</p>

<p>Down in sickbay the Doctor had just about finished running his scans and
releasing patients. He only had one more to go and that happened to be Seven.
B'Elanna stood off to the left while the Doctor completed his scans and soon
there after giving her a clean bill of health. Before Seven could hop down from
the biobed, B'Elanna stepped directly in front of her standing between her
legs.</p>

<p>&quot;Lieutenant?&quot; Seven questioned with her eyebrow quirked.</p>

<p>&quot;It's B'Elanna, Seven.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;B'Elanna&quot;. Seven tested out the name.</p>

<p>Even without Seven's voice being laced with desire the mere mention of her
name from Seven's lips seemed to cause chills to run down her back.</p>

<p>&quot;B'Elanna, I wish to...&quot;</p>

<p>Seven was cut short by B'Elanna placing her fingers over Seven's lips.</p>

<p>&quot;Shh. I don't want an apology. I just wanted to let you know that I
understand. It wasn't really you acting that way, just another of Q's games. I
don't hold anything against you. In fact I think I should be the one apologizing
here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, for kissing you back, I guess. You may have had an excuse but I
didn't and, well, I'm sorry.&quot; B'Elanna rushed through her apology.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not accept.&quot; Seven whispered.</p>

<p>&quot;What?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not regret you kissing me and therefore do not wish for an
apology for your actions. Now if you'll excuse me the Doctor has instructed me
to 'rest'.&quot; Seven said more forcefully trying to hide true feelings.</p>

<p>Seven jumped down from the biobed and brushed past B'Elanna. Seven was
already out the door before B'Elanna realized what Seven had just essentially
told her.</p>

<p>&quot;Kahless!&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna rushed out to meet Seven and just barely caught up with her inside
the turbolift before the doors closed. Seven was surprised when B'Elanna had
followed her but was totally shocked when B'Elanna pushed Seven up against the
wall and stood so close to Seven that she cold feel B'Elanna breath on her
neck.</p>

<p>&quot;I never said I regretted the kiss either.&quot;</p>

<p>And with that said, B'Elanna leaned in to kiss Seven. And it was the most
intense, passionate kiss B'Elanna had ever experienced. All of their passions
seemed to travel through that one kiss. Before both knew it their tongues were
dueling for the right of possession. Even though both had run out of breath the
kiss somehow continued until the turbolift lurched to a stop. Breaking the kiss
Seven whispered,</p>

<p>&quot;I must return to the cargo bay to regenerate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The last time we did this I promised that next time we wouldn't be
interrupted. Stay with me.&quot; B'Elanna suggested with a smile. Seven
returned the smile and leaned down to put a chaste kiss on B'Elanna's lips.</p>

<p>&quot;Deck three.&quot; B'Elanna ordered and as the doors closed, leaned
into Seven.</p>

<p>B'Elanna sighed in content and for the first time allowed herself to breath
in Seven's scent. It was almost sweet and smelled of distant lilacs but there
was also a very slight metallic tinge to it but B'Elanna found that all the
more delectable. Seven wrapped her arms around B'Elanna and found it
surprisingly easy for her to just hold B'Elanna close. Looking back, B'Elanna
realised that she couldn't remember a time when she hated the ex-drone. True
their relationship was antagonistic but it was just a way to release pent up
passions. In fact her's and Tom's relationship started out the same way, they
were just too different. 'But what if it ends the same way too?' B'Elanna's
little voice piped up. And in that moment B'Elanna realized that this time was
going to be different, not just about passions but....</p>

<p>&quot;Seven?&quot; B'Elanna looked into questioning eyes. &quot;I love
you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I believe I love you too, B'Elanna Torres.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven smile a huge smile, one that no one had ever thought the ex-borg
capable of and wrapped her arms around B'Elanna tighter. Just then the
turbolift doors opened and Tom Paris as well as Jennifer Delaney got to see
something they never thought possible.</p>

<p>&quot;Tom.&quot; B'Elanna nodded politely.</p>

<p>&quot;Lieutenant Paris, Ensign Delaney.&quot; Seven greeted as she walked
past.</p>

<p>&quot;Lanna?&quot; Tom croaked, unable to believe his eyes.</p>

<p>B'Elanna had stopped hoping to clear the air right here and now but Seven
just kept walking. B'Elanna was about to go after her when Tom spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;You and the ice queen? You left me for her?&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna slammed Paris into the wall, fed up with him and his snide remarks.
Not having the time or the will to deal with Tom, B'Elanna answered with one
word.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>Dropping Tom to the floor, B'Elanna headed off to go find Seven.</p>

<p>&quot;Computer, locate Seven of Nine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Seven of Nine is in B'Elanna Torres's quarters.&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna left a stunned Tom behind a half run toward her quarters.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on Tom, I'll help you forget about her.&quot; Jennifer said as
she helped Tom off the floor.</p>

<hr>

<p>Entering her quarters, the first thing B'Elanna noticed was Seven actually
sitting on her couch. At this point B'Elanna had become very concerned so she
knelt in front of Seven and stroked some loose strand of blond hair out of the
drone's eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, why'd you run? What's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>And that's when Seven let all of her fears be known. &quot;You may go back
to Mr. Paris if you wish. I will understand. He is the better mate. More of the
crew accept him, he is physically attractive, and more human than I will ever
be.&quot;</p>

<p>It was the closest thing to babbling that Seven had shown.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you done yet?&quot; B'Elanna said with a smile and all Seven could
do was nod vigorously. &quot;Good because I'd like to set a few things
straight. First, I do not want Tom back. Jennifer can have him for all I care,
I got what I want right here. And as for the crew liking him better, well then
they can have him. And did you know you were voted the most gorgeous person
aboard Voyager? Well okay maybe not 'voted' but everyone thinks so including
me. And I certainly think that you have definitely surpassed Tom Paris in the
more humane category. Seven you are the most honest, loyal, passionate, caring,
funny, intelligent, beautiful, and innocent person I know. And if I truly
thought hard and long, I bet there was not one time when I didn't admire you or
your skills. I may not have shown my true feelings for everyone to see but then
again neither did you. We are so much alike with just enough difference thrown
in to make things interesting, not difficult. And I promise in the future to
show you just how much I do love and admire you, Seven. And I do love you Seven
of Nine.&quot;</p>

<p>For the second time since being severed from the collective, Seven was
crying.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For what?&quot; B'Elanna asked busy trying to wipe the tears from the
face she adored.</p>

<p>&quot;For loving me. I love you too. More than I ever thought
possible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, didn't the doctor say you need some rest?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, he thought it would be best for me to 'take it easy' for the next
few days.&quot; Seven answered as B'Elanna took her hand and lead her to the en
suite.</p>

<p>&quot;So, have you gotten any better at that sleeping thing since your last
attempt?&quot;</p>

<p>And with that B'Elanna and Seven slipped out of sight and into the bedroom.</p>
