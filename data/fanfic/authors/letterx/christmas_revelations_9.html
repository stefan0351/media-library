<!-- Christmas Revelations \ Part 9 -->

<p>Tom was in the mess-hall pouring over some sort of data on a pad. This was
the first time most of the crew had ever seen Tom so studious, so they decided
to leave him to his work. Actually, Tom could be very studious, but only when
the purpose served him and this time was no different. On the data pad was the
current information regarding the arrest and imprisonment of B'Elanna Torres.
Tom figured that since he wasn't able to see B'Elanna then he'd have to be the
knight in shinning armor coming to her rescue. Tom was looking for a loop hole
in which to get Lanna out of the brig when he noticed a change. The status of
the prisoner went from no visitors to visitors allowed. Now Tom didn't need
Tuvok's permission to go see Lanna and he wondered why he was still in the
mess-hall with some stupid pad. Paris jumped up from his seat and headed out of
the mess-hall, plan of freeing Lanna forgotten. Stepping into the turbolift,
Tom ordered the lift to deck 3 (crew's quarters) instead of deck 8 (the brig).
Tom needed to pick up something from his quarters because he had a plan to put
into effect when he went to visit B'Elanna. Did anyone really expect Tom to
just pop in on Lanna and say hi? No Tom had something special planned for his
little visit.</p>

<p>About five minutes after Paris had left the mess-hall, Seven of Nine walked
in. She scanned the crowd obviously looking for something but when she didn't
find it she questioned the computer.</p>

<p>&quot;Computer locate Tom Paris.&quot; Seven ordered with something that
resembled a sigh.</p>

<p>&quot;Tom Paris is in his quarters.&quot; The computer replied nonplussed.</p>

<p>Seven upon hearing the answer, turned and left the mess-hall once again in
search of Lt. Tom Paris.</p>

<p>Tom gathered up what he needed rather quickly, and immediately left his
quarters heading straight for the brig. Little did he know, he had an ex-drone
looking for him and that he certainly didn't want her to find him in the brig.</p>

<p>Tom quickly made his way to the brig and almost ran right through the doors
in his excitement. Inside the brig, stood the one guard and the one active cell
B'Elanna was in. Paris walked right up to the guard, announcing that he was
here to visit with Lanna. This of course not only got the attention of the
guard, but also that of B'Elanna's who immediately stood up and went as close
to the force field as possible. Torres let off a low growl and began to beg
Kahless to cause the force field to all of a sudden fail. Tom noticed none of
this as he was too busy taking in hushed tones with the guard putting his plan
to work.</p>

<p>&quot;Ensign, I know this is against the rules and regulations but I want to
be allowed into the cell with Lanna. I know what you're going to say but how
about I just give you this pad full of holographic porn to look at. And then
when to turn your back you won't be able to see me lower the force field and
step into the cell with Lanna. I promise you this is not an escape attempt and
that even if Tuvok were to find out about this it wouldn't be a problem.&quot;</p>

<p>Ensign Harvey Padmore was not a man for breaking the rules. No one under
Tuvok's command was. Nor was he a man that actually enjoyed holographic porn.
It was just dirty. Ensign Padmore also knew that if he lowered the force fields
and allow Lt. Paris to enter the cell, it would be like signing Tom's death
warrant. But none of that mattered as Padmore took the pad and turned around.
The ensign had very little respect for Tom and liked him even less. Paris
treated all the crewmen under him like second class citizens. Tom thought he
was above them and even acted like it sometimes. Harvey thought, no he knew,
that Thomas Eugene Paris needed to be taught a lesson.</p>

<p>When the guard had turned his back, Tom leaned over the control panel and
pressed a few buttons. One of the cells did open, but it wasn't the right one.
Paris realized he was looking at the controls upside down and probably pressed
a few wrong buttons. He looked over at Lanna and shrugged his shoulders while
Lanna just stood there, waiting with a feral smile on her face. Just as he was
about to correct his mistake, Seven walked into the brig. When Seven had found
out that Tom was now located in the brig she became very angry. Now upon seeing
what Tom was trying to do, Seven became furious. She stalked towards Tom,
forcing him to walk backwards toward the cell that was now open. No one,
including Tom, could see just how furious Seven was. Lanna may not have been
able to see the change in emotion, but she of all people knew when Seven was
ready to blow a fuse. Ensign Padmore still had his back to the group but now he
had a huge smile on his face. Seven backed Tom all the way into the cell that
he had previously opened and followed him in.</p>

<p>Harvey then 'accidentally' leaned back on the controls pressing a few key
buttons that effectively brought the force field on-line. Now Tom was trapped
in the cell with Seven of Nine, and if he thought that Lanna was the most
dangerous person on the ship, he had another thing coming.</p>

<p>&quot;Lt. Paris, explain your actions.&quot;</p>

<p>'God and I thought the Captain could cut duranium with her voice.' Tom
thought as a sudden wave of fear enveloped him.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,... I... uh..., hey, not that it's any of your business but I
wanted to visit with Lanna. Not that you would understand but even after we
broke up I still cared for her and I know she still feels the same for
me.&quot; Tom was now angry that this ex-borg could frighten him let alone
question what he was planning with B'Elanna. So instead of being smart he lashed
out against Seven the only way he could and that was through verbal attacks.</p>

<p>&quot;What?!&quot; Lanna couldn't keep quiet any longer. &quot;I do not
still care for you. The only feelings I have towards you are feelings of
hatred. You convinced the captain that the holodecks were safe to use and
therefore I hold you personally responsible for what happened to Seven and all
the hurt you caused her. You hurt her in more ways than you can even
comprehend. And for hurting the woman that I love, the only thing I plan to do
with you, is to kill you, you p'tach. You better count your lucky stars that
you ended up in that cell with Seven instead of in here with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're in love with Seven, the Borg ice queen? How could you betray
what we have with this thing?&quot; Tom kept throwing insults at Seven,
realizing that he was pretty safe. Seven wouldn't disregard protocol unless she
felt it necessary and she wouldn't hit him because it was just an inefficient
use of energy. But what Tom didn't know was that Seven was more than willing to
play his game.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, she is in love with me. Perhaps she finds being with the Borg ice
queen preferable to being with you.&quot;</p>

<p>Tom lost it after that. He wasn't prepared for Seven to insult his manhood
and grew enraged because of it. Tom tried to throw a punch which Seven blocked
easily but that was all that she was waiting for. Now that the first punch had
been thrown with more on their way, Seven, using her fully human, took a good
slug at Tom's face. Even though Seven's hand was human, she still did possess a
great amount of strength. Tom's lip cracked open and began to bleed while Seven
heard his cheek bone cracking. Seven could have used her Borg enhanced hand and
caused a lot more damage, but she wouldn't have gotten the same satisfaction
she did by punching Tom with her human hand. Still, Tom tried to take another
swing at Seven but she retaliated with a knee to the groin. Tom collapsed to
the floor moaning in pain, but at least he was no longer a threat (as if he
ever was one). Seven looked over to where B'Elanna stood in her cell stunned.
Her mouth was agape and her eyes were wide. But what caught Seven's attention
was that Lanna's eyes were darting back and forth between the cell she was in
and the door to the brig. When Seven turned to look at who was standing at the
door to the brig, she almost rolled her eyes, almost. Of course, Captain
Janeway and Lt. Tuvok would come walking into the brig just in time to see
Seven having it out with Paris. Janeway ordered the guard to lower the force
field and allowed Seven to step out. As soon as she was clear, Janeway ordered
the force field up again leaving Tom in there huddled on the floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Either you are a very lucky woman, Seven of Nine, or you're smarter
than we ever gave you credit for. You managed to play Paris's insult game and
then turned the tables on him. You managed to get him to swing first and can
defend your actions by saying you were only defending yourself. You also
managed to avoid the charge of excessive force when defending yourself by only
using your human hand instead of your Borg enhancements. Bravo. I'm going to
have a little chat with Lt. Torres about her sentence change. Tuvok, you can
handle this assault case.&quot; Janeway left the two and headed for Lanna's
cell.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven of Nine. As the captain has stated I can not bring you up on any
charges and neither can Mr. Paris. However, you can file charges against the
Lt. for attempted assault.&quot; Tuvok stated his question.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I do not want to file charges. I believe that Mr. Paris has
finally come to an understanding and has learned a valuable lesson in the
process. I do respectfully request that Mr. Paris be escorted down to sickbay
to be looked at and given a time to 'cool down'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is acceptable. I will escort Mr. Paris myself after I have a discussion
with Ensign Padmore.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lt., belay that discussion. I think that the Ensign understands what
he did here was wrong and that he shouldn't let it happen again. Because if it
does, then he will be cleaning the Jeffries tubes the next time we need a guard
to watch a prisoner. Is that clear enough for you,Ensign?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, ma'am.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good. Tuvok, why don't you take Mr. Paris down to sickbay now and then
when the Doctor is finished fixing him up please escort him to my ready
room.&quot;</p>

<p>Tuvok left with a nod, following Tom out of the brig. Janeway then dismissed
Seven, stating that B'Elanna was a prisoner after all and visiting hours were
over. After Seven left, Janeway walked over to the force field holding Lanna
inside her cell. She still had one more thing she wanted to say to the Lt.</p>

<p>&quot;Lt. Torres, I wanted you to know that although I'm none too happy with
the fact that you punched a superior officer, let alone me, I don't personally
hold it against you. I might have done the same thing if our places were
reversed. I just have one question for you. What's your favorite number?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?!&quot; Torres was surprised to still be in the good graces of
her captain after all that's happened but she was dumbfounded as to why this
woman wanted to know her favorite number.</p>

<p>&quot;You're favorite number Lt., between 1 and 35. You do have one
right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Umm, yes. It's 23. Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because if you ever end up intentionally hurting Seven, then I will
personally throw you out of airlock number 23.&quot;</p>

<p>And the captain left B'Elanna to contemplate that little tid bit.</p>
