<p>&quot;Neelix, Neelix! Hey look what I found.&quot; Naomi screamed across the
mess hall while waving a data pad.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it, honey?&quot; Neelix asked as he went to scoop the little
Katarian up in his arms.</p>

<p>&quot;Halloween&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hallow-what?&quot;</p>

<p>Confused and quite curious as to what this little girl was all excited
about, Neelix sat down at an empty table with Naomi on his lap.</p>

<p>&quot;Halloween, silly.&quot; Naomi said with all the patience of an eight
year old child. &quot;It's a human holiday, a very old one not celebrated any
more. It's about...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh a holiday, which means party and with the crew still feeling a
little anxious over the recent mutiny attempt, this could definitely put the
crew at ease and lift quite a few spirits.&quot; Neelix contemplated aloud already
planning the event in his head.</p>

<p>Putting Naomi back on her feet, Neelix stood to go start his proposal to the
Captain. Mumbling excitedly to himself he crossed the mess hall and walked into
the kitchen. As Neelix exited the kitchen again this time hands full of data
pads, he realized something. &quot;Wait, what exactly is Halloween and what
type of party am I suppose to throw?&quot;</p>

<p>Standing with her hands on her hips, Naomi waved the data pad at him.
&quot;Well, I was about to tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>Neelix returned to their table and motioned for Naomi to sit.</p>

<p>&quot;Please, do go on.&quot; Neelix smiled and sat as well.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, you see Halloween was a time when children got dressed up in
different costumes and went around collecting candy...&quot;, referring to her
pad, Naomi continued to tell Neelix all about Halloween.</p>

<p>In the Captain's ready room, Neelix stood at parade attention with his hands
tightly clasped behind his back. The Captain on the other hand sat comfortably
in her chair behind the desk reading Neelix's request.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Mr. Neelix, this certainly does sound.. interesting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is Captain and fun too. With all the stress and uncertainty the
crew's been under lately, wondering if they can trust one another again, this
should definitely be something so silly it will make the crew forget the past
month or so and help them to... well, lighten up.&quot;</p>

<p>Looking up from the pad, Janeway wondered just how much the crew had been
affected by the recent mind control incident. Janeway knew the Maquis members
of the crew were not really responsible for the mutiny but how does the rest of
the crew feel about it. Trust on the ship had been diminishing slowly ever
since Tuvok's investigation. Perhaps moral was worse off than she thought.</p>

<p>&quot;You just might be right, Mr. Neelix. After starting a civil war within
the borg, Seven's near death experience, and a not so relaxing space race it's
time to get a little... silly.&quot; Janeway said, accompanying that last word
with a silly face of her own. She handed back the pad to Neelix with a huge grin
on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Make it so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye, Ma'am.&quot; Neelix answered with a grin of his own.</p>

<p>The following day saw to it that the rumor of this Halloween party,
happening in less than a week, was all over the ship. Walking into the
conference room was Harry Kim and his best friend Tom Paris talking about what
else, but that damned rumor. Harry looked to be about as excited as Naomi was
when Neelix told her the Captain had approved of the party. But Tom looked as
though someone had stolen his favorite toy and killed his only pet.</p>

<p>&quot;So, Tom, you going to the Halloween party, or what?&quot; Harry tried
to lighten his mood.</p>

<p>&quot;No&quot; was the only response Harry got when both he and Tom sat down
next to each other. Other than the Captain and Tuvok, who were over in the
corner talking amongst themselves, they were the first to arrive.</p>

<p>&quot;Why not, Tom? Its suppose to be really silly and who does silly better
than Tom Paris?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think so, Harry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tom, I know she might be there but you can't keep hiding from her.
Yes, you see her for staff meetings but you still have to spend a lot of time
on this ship together and believe me its a small ship. You will eventually bump
into her so why not do it sooner rather than later? At least at the party there
will be lots of people around so it shouldn't be that uncomfortable.&quot;
Harry reasoned with Tom, trying desperately to get him out of this funk he'd
been in for days. It seemed that during the mutiny an ensign from Astrometrics
had let it slip to B'Elanna in a disparaging comment about Starfleet officers
and their loyalties, that Tom Paris had slept with Jennifer Delaney about a
month before he proposed to B'Elanna. At that point in their relationship, Tom
and B'Elanna had been arguing a lot. The latest being that B'Elanna had
volunteered for the extremely dangerous away mission to get assimilated by the
borg. Tom didn't like not being asked if it was okay with him for B'Elanna to
volunteer. When confronted about the infidelity, Tom argued that it had been
because they were fighting so much and he needed comfort but that was in the
past and his proposal was for the future. B'Elanna had some doubts about
continuing her relationship with Tom even before the proposal, as well as,
after and they were proven correct with Tom's betrayal. So since the marriage was
no more than an agreement, there had not been a ceremony because of one thing
or another, B'Elanna had just called it off, leaving Tom in the wallowing mess
he was in now.</p>

<p>Harry looked at Tom with pleading eyes and Tom knew that if he didn't give
in now, Harry would just continue to pester him about going. 'Maybe he's right,
maybe I need to get out and try to move on. Obviously B'Elanna didn't have
trouble forgetting about me. After all there are plenty of fish in the sea.'
Tom tried to gain some of his bravado back.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, Harry. You win, I'll go.&quot; Tom said with a sigh, only now
wondering what he was getting himself into.</p>

<p>After hearing Tom's relenting, Harry jumped right into a conversation about
what costumes to wear.</p>

<p>About a half hour later the staff meeting was just about concluded except
for one more matter Janeway wanted to bring up.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, people. Now about this Halloween party.&quot;</p>

<p>Groans were heard across the table and the Captain guessed that this group
was tired of hearing about it, all except Harry and Neelix that is.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm all sure you've heard all about this party Neelix is throwing so I
won't go into great detail about it.&quot; Sighs of relief was the response
that Janeway got. She even thought she heard one from Tuvok.</p>

<p>&quot;But I do want to say one thing. I expect to see ALL of you there and
in full costume,&quot; holding her hands up to stop the protests from Seven,
B'Elanna, and Tuvok, &quot;I know recently has been a very trying time but this
is the perfect opportunity to relax and perhaps even get silly. We are all over
due for some R &amp; R and I wish I didn't have to make this mandatory but
knowing the dedicated crew I have I'm going to have to. So I will be seeing you
all there and can't wait to see what creative costumes you choose to wear.
Dismissed.&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone gathered there things and filed out all the while grumbling under
their breaths. And the Captain was left alone.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that went easier than I thought it would.&quot; Just then a
chill went up her spine. 'What was that old phrase... I think someone just walked
over my grave.' Which could only mean one thing. This was definitely not going
to be easy in the least.</p>

<p>Seven of Nine was down in engineering working on a console off to the right
of the warp core well away from any of the crew. It had been a couple of days
since that staff meeting in which Captain Janeway had made the Halloween party
mandatory. After several long extensive conversations with Miss Naomi Wildman,
Seven had finally picked out the costume she was to wear and replicated it that
morning with the help of the doctor. As it was, Seven did not want to go to
this party, but now it seemed she had to wear a costume as well, which would
only bring more attention to her. Something she wished to avoid if at all
possible, but in this case it seemed all attempts to do so would be futile.</p>

<p>&quot;Irrelevant human holiday.&quot; Seven cursed in her own borg way.</p>

<p>&quot;I take it you're dreading this party as much as I am.&quot; B'Elanna
said as she came to stand right next to the borg. Seven turned to face B'Elanna
and saw a smile playing at the corners of her mouth. &quot;If I didn't know any
better I'd say that was the borg equivalent of a curse but of course borg don't
curse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are correct Lieutenant, that was not a curse but I am also no
longer borg.&quot; Seven smirked as she played word games with the Lieutenant.
Ever since that away mission in which B'Elanna was partially assimilated the
two women had seemed to come to an understanding. B'Elanna began to realize how
wrong she was for blaming Seven for being a drone when she really had no
control over it. Even Tuvok could not resist the call of the collective and
Tuvok was the most controlled person she knew. Seven on the other hand had
realized how much she and B'Elanna were alike. Not only did they share the
experience of being assimilated but they also shared many like qualities.
Stubbornness, arrogance, intelligence, physical strength, hiding one's
emotions, and even passion when it came to protecting their collective. And
some time over the past month both women realized they felt some attraction
toward the other. They both connected at some level, unlike B'Elanna's
relationship with Paris where it was only passion and no understanding. But she
and Seven had that and more. Even when they hated each other they could still
trust each other with their lives, they were also brutally honest and still
managed to have a certain respect for the other. They were equals; fire versus
fire; passion versus passion. A friendship was blossoming but there was the
potential for more.</p>

<p>Seven had noticed that the two of them had been standing there looking into
each other's eyes for quite some time now and decided to break the silence in
her usual abrupt manner.</p>

<p>&quot;I have heard from several members of the crew that you have terminated
your marriage to Lieutenant Paris. Are you functioning adequately?&quot; Seven
never thought that Lieutenant Torres should be mated to Tom Paris for he was
not at all suitable and was relieved to hear of their breakup. But you won't
hear Seven admit to that.</p>

<p>&quot;What?!&quot; B'Elanna was thrown off by the sudden change in topic.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Seven tried again. Torres took a few moments to
gather her thoughts before answering that loaded question.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess I am, Seven. Why do I look terrible or something?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On the contrary, you seem to be adapting well. I only wished to
'return the favor'.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What favor?&quot; Now B'Elanna was even more confused.</p>

<p>&quot;During my illness you attempted to comfort me by talking and listening
to me. I only wished to offer you the same.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh... well... gee thanks, Seven, but I really am fine. I suppose it
just wasn't meant to be. I mean we had all the passion and perhaps some love
but none of the understanding, trust, honesty, or loyalty a relationship should
have. A little difference can be good for a relationship but too much
isn't.&quot; B'Elanna stopped talking immediately after she realized she had
just described her relationship with Seven.</p>

<p>&quot;I see. If you ever do need to talk, know that I am willing to
listen.&quot; B'Elanna nodded dumbly and walked away leaving Seven to wonder if
B'Elanna had been referring to their relationship or if she was just being
general. Seven found that at times like these, hope comes in very handy.</p>

<p>The following night was the party where everyone was suppose to relax and
have a fun time but earlier that afternoon was anything but fun. Several
engineering relays had blown out due to a faulty replicated part being put in,
not to mention the undue stress Voyager had been under lately. Seven was again
working in engineering and decided to help by repairing the parts herself but
nothing with Seven is ever that simple. Not only was she going to repair the
faulty relays but improve them as well. This of course lead to a heated
argument between Seven and the Chief who didn't approve of the improvements. At
one point the engineering team began to duck because they thought the two would
come to blows. But in the end they somehow managed a compromise, proving to
themselves and others that, yes they can still be very passionate about what
they do, but they now had a new understanding of the other.</p>

<p>Later that evening, Voyager was orbiting a moon in an uninhabited star
system and running on a skeleton crew. Everyone who was not on duty was at the
Halloween party being held in the holodeck. The holodeck was turned into a
great big mansion which the guests could explore for a frightening good time.
Entering a huge set of double doors you entered the main hall where a few
guests were milling about. Directly in front was a huge marble staircase
leading upstairs and to the rest of the house but the majority of the people
seemed to be in the great dining hall off to the left of the staircase. Walking
inside you could see four long tables almost the length of the entire room
where some were seated eating dinner and talking. Others were scattered
throughout the decorated room talking in groups generally having a great time
all dressed up in various costumes. Music played in the background ranging from
spooky sounds to fun music like the monster mash. Off towards the right center
of the room was the Captain. She happened to be dressed up as a cat in a black
skin-tight outfit complete with the tail, whiskers, and claws, looking like she
was ready to pounce. Next to her stood a mummified Neelix wrapped completely
from head to toe in toilet paper. (His research into Halloween showed that toilet
paper was used very often but he didn't know it wasn't for that purpose)</p>

<p>&quot;Neelix, again, you have out done yourself. This place is great and I'm
having a lot of fun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why thank you, Captain, but I can't take all the credit. Mr. Kim
designed the program I only supplied him with the idea.&quot; Neelix blushed.</p>

<p>Harry who was standing close by heard the comment and decided to join the
conversation. He walked himself over to the two officers but as soon as he got
there he looked as if he were about to faint. Poor Harry decided to get dressed
up as a werewolf but put on too much fur. He felt as if he were on a desert
planet with all that fur on. 'How do animals survive this?'</p>

<p>&quot;I may have designed the program, Neelix but I couldn't have done it
without your help. And by the way I'm having such a good time too. I hear I
have Naomi to thank for that. Where is she anyway?&quot;</p>

<p>Neelix pointed to a table where Naomi and her mother sat eating their
dinner. Samantha Wildman was dressed up as the devil and her daughter an angel.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, isn't that suppose to be the other way around?&quot; Tom
suggested as he joined the group.</p>

<p>Tom had just arrived in his Elvis (later years) costume. Well, at least he
knew what he was suppose to be, everyone else just kept asking what kind of
monster he was. Tom even had a guitar to go along with the costume but nobody
knew what that was either.</p>

<p>&quot;Nice costume, ma'am.&quot; Tom said as he eyed his captain. Only he
would be so brave or so foolish. &quot;So where's the Commander? I'd like to
see what he's wearing too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's over there. See the Cowardly Lion?&quot; the Captain pointed.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, how come everyone knows who the Commander is but no one knows who
I am?&quot; Tom whined.</p>

<p>&quot;Because the Wizard of Oz is still a classic whereas The Elvis Lives
Theory died about 3 centuries ago.&quot; B'Elanna joined in momentarily
forgetting the supposed awkwardness about being around Tom.</p>

<p>Tom turned around to see a smiling B'Elanna and couldn't help but smile
back. Not only was she joking around with him but she was wearing an old amazon
costume leaving very little to the imagination. But then things got quiet all
of a sudden with no one knowing what to say or do. Fortunately or
unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, Jennifer Delaney showed up
dressed as a harem girl and asked Elvis to dance. Tom nodded okay and the two
left the group.</p>

<p>&quot;So, what's up with the costume, Maquis. Not that it doesn't look good
on you.&quot; Harry decided to break the ice.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, since this was an old earth holiday and I'm a warrior I decided
to dress up as an old earth warrior.&quot; B'Elanna joked, relieved for the
tension breaker.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we're still missing three of the senior staff. Tuvok, Seven, and
the Doctor. I hope everything is okay.&quot; Janeway commented.</p>

<p>&quot;Actually, I saw Tuvok a few minutes ago. He's the one under the sheet.
Suppose to be a ghost. Very simplistic but at least he got dressed up.&quot;
B'Elanna pointed out.</p>

<p>Suddenly gasps were heard throughout the room and the group noticed everyone
staring at the entrance. Turning they saw the Doctor standing there dressed up
as a 1920's gangster with Seven on his arm. But what had shocked everyone was
Seven's costume. Seven was dressed up in a very sexy form fitting black
spaghetti strap dress showing off every curve. It hung down to the mid thigh
showing off Seven's long legs and had an impossibly low neckline.</p>

<p>She also had on a pair of black high heeled shoes and wore her hair in curls
cascading down her back. To complete the ensemble Seven wore a diamond studded
necklace and ankle bracelet. Her face was painted white and she sported a nice
set of fangs. All in all a heart stopping site, at least for B'Elanna that is.</p>

<p>&quot;A vampire&quot; B'Elanna whispered almost afraid to break the mood.</p>

<p>Seven herself was beginning to feel uncomfortable with all the attention and
began to regret coming. The Doctor felt her stiffen and patted her on the arm
for encouragement. Seven thought back to the Doctor's lessons and remembered
that humor is usually used as a tension breaker.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe I have found a new way to assimilate you all.&quot; Seven
grinned showing her fangs which got the expected laughter in return. Soon
enough everyone went back to what they were doing.</p>

<p>Other than Seven's entrance that evening, the night went by uneventfully.
Everyone had a good time eating, laughing, and even getting drunk. B'Elanna had
stayed away from Seven for the most part during the night afraid that she may
do or say something that Seven would regret later. Seven for her part actually
mingled with the crowd, talking and smiling. It seemed that Seven really did
have a good time and B'Elanna just enjoyed watching Seven smile.</p>

<p>It was now almost two o'clock in the morning and just about everyone had
left for the night. Naomi and her mother left about 3 hours ago with Tuvok,
Chakotay, and the Doctor shortly after. The Captain stayed an extra hour but
that was it for her. No one noticed when Tom left or even wondered where
Jennifer had gotten off to and so it was just Harry, B'Elanna, and Seven left
as well as a few drunks too tired to move.</p>

<p>&quot;Why don't you take Seven home and I'll close up the place.&quot; But
before B'Elanna had time to respond Harry was off rounding up the leftovers.
Seven was sitting by herself with a smile on her face sipping at her drink.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, are you drunk?&quot; B'Elanna asked with a smile.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I was just replaying the evening over and enjoying myself again. I
do not remember ever having so much fun at a social gathering before. I find I
do not wish this night to be over.&quot; Seven answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Neither do I, Seven but I do have to get you back to the cargo bay
now, so come on.&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna assisted Seven in standing even though it was unnecessary but
neither one was going to mention that. B'Elanna kept her hand on Seven's waist
as she guided her out of the holodeck and to the turbo lift. The walk was silent
but not uncomfortably so. About halfway to the lift the ship was rocked and
engulfed in a blinding white light. Seven was knocked to the ground as B'Elanna
was temporarily blinded. As fast as it came it was over just as quickly. A
yellow alert was sounded and B'Elanna once again grabbed a hold of Seven.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on. Lets get down to engineering and find out what the hell just
happened.&quot;</p>

<p align=right><a class=link href="#top">Top</a></p>

<table cellspacing=0 width=100%>
<tr><td class=h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 3</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Within 15 minutes the Captain had ordered down the red alert when it seemed
that Voyager was no longer in any danger. What ever happened it seemed was over
just as quickly as it had begun.</p>

<p>As soon as B'Elanna could see again after being blinded by that light she
had dragged Seven down to engineering with her, and quite literally at that. It
seemed that Seven wasn't up to moving at all from her spot on the floor after
falling when the ship was rocked. The engineer nearly carried Seven all the way
which was odd in and of itself but when they had both arrived in the engine
room Seven had wondered off to a dark corner by herself. She never even tried
to butt in to help discover what had happened and for some odd reason seemed to
avoid all bright light and that was what tipped B'Elanna off that something was
just not right. As B'Elanna worked to try and figure out what had happened she
kept a close eye on the borg not yet ready to make a scene and drag Seven to sickbay.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later and the red alert was cancelled but she was still no
closer to figuring out what had happened. Nothing came up on the damned sensors
and the ship was undamaged so why were the hairs on the back of her neck
standing up. Looking up she saw Seven hunched over a console gripping it
tightly and shaking slightly. Concerned, B'Elanna rushed over to see what was
going on. Just as the Lieutenant had reached her, Seven stopped shaking. Rather
than call for an emergency beam out, B'Elanna decided to ask Seven if she were
okay. Putting her hand on Seven's bare arm, she was surprised to find it so
cold. But what surprised her even more was when Seven grabbed her wrist, turned
her around, and slammed her back up against the wall. Before she could react,
Seven closed the remaining distance so that most of their bodies were rubbing
against each other. Seven than dipped her head and began to lick B'Elanna's
neck just above the pulse point in small sensual circles.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, what in Kahless's name, are you doing?&quot; B'Elanna managed
to croak out in between gasps.</p>

<p>Seven stopped her licking and brought her face even with B'Elanna's but her
nails continued the assault on her neck by ever so lightly scratching at the
skin. That's when B'Elanna saw something she hadn't seen before. Forget the
fact that Seven's eyes were now golden and she wasn't wearing any contacts but
Seven's eyes held a passion, a desire that made B'Elanna's knees go weak.</p>

<p>&quot;I want you, B'Elanna. I need to taste you.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven's voice held so much desire in it that B'Elanna could do nothing but
close her eyes and let whatever happen, happen. That's when B'Elanna missed
Seven baring her new sharp and long fangs preparing to feast on that supple
neck right in front of her. The next thing B'Elanna knew was that Seven had
fallen limp in her arms and the moment had been broken. Looking up as she
guided Seven to the floor she saw Lieutenant Vorik aiming a phaser at the two
of them.</p>

<p>Within the next two hours an emergency staff meeting was called. Noticeably
missing from the senior staff was Seven, Chakotay, Paris, and Neelix who were
all being detained in sickbay. All dressed in uniforms again, the Captain began
the meeting.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, Doctor. Tell us what you have.&quot; Janeway asked with her
command mask fully in place to hide the worry she felt.</p>

<p>&quot;Not much, I'm afraid. It seems that the crew who are in sickbay right
now seem to have taken on the personalities of their costumes. They aren't just
acting like who they pretended to be but they have literally become those
people or monsters as the case may be. I have no cause nor a cure for this
epidemic but it does seem to be limited to the crew in sickbay. What I can tell
you is that it seems to be linked to that bright light we encountered before.
All the cases occurred within 15 minutes of that event, with Seven being the
last case to be brought in. The only commonality between each individual is
that they were all still wearing their Halloween costumes.</p>

<p>&quot;But I was still dressed in my costume at the time so why didn't I turn
into an amazon?&quot; B'Elanna questioned angrily, still very much worried
about Seven.</p>

<p>&quot;As far as I can tell, this thing seems to be random the only
requirement was wearing a costume at the time.&quot; Doc answered as best he
could. Even he was stumped by this.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Doctor for your input. I would like to be kept up on the
patients' conditions and expect frequent reports.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Captain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, right now the only lead we have into this mysterious illness is
our other mystery. Harry any ideas on that bright light we experienced.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;None, Captain. The sensors didn't pick up any thing unusual as if it
had never even happened and nothing like this has ever been recorded before. I
don't know what to tell you&quot; a distraught Harry explained.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, fine. Does anyone have anything they wish to add? No? Then I
want everyone working on finding out something, anything about our two
mysteries. Use every trick in the book if you have to but I want answers AND
solutions. Dismissed.&quot;</p>

<p>The Captain sighed. 'Why can't anything ever be easy'.</p>

<p>Later that morning just as the alpha shift was beginning, Janeway was called
down to sickbay.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Captain. All the signs of being a vampire have disappeared from
Seven. She no longer has fangs or glowing eyes or even a desire to hide from
light. It appears she's cured.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But how, why?&quot; The Captain was relieved but still concerned.</p>

<p>&quot;We believe that my nanoprobes had something to do with it but are
unsure as to how or why.&quot; Seven answered for the Doc.</p>

<p>Seven didn't want to stay in sickbay a moment longer and hoped to convince
Janeway that she was alright.</p>

<p>&quot;Captain, I would like Seven to regenerate considering she hasn't done
so for 48 hours and I will be monitoring her through a cortical monitor and at
the slightest change will bring her back in.&quot; The Doctor said as he placed
the monitor on Seven's neck.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, Doctor. I will leave the decision up to you.&quot; Janeway
agreed.</p>

<p>And with that Seven was out the door before you could say vampire coming
through. The Doctor then went about checking up on his other patients who all
remained sedated on biobeds. The Captain decided to head back to the bridge for
the remainder of her shift.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Seven headed straight for the cargo bay wanting to start her
regeneration cycle as soon as possible. The sooner she did that the sooner she
would stop thinking about what had taken place between her and Lieutenant
Torres. Every time she would think about licking that beautiful neck she'd feel
this all too familiar ache and then she would think about how repulsed B'Elanna
would be if she ever found out that Seven had feelings for her. These feelings
were all too new for Seven and she just didn't know what to do, say, or even
think. Seven entered the cargo bay and instructed the computer for an eight
hour regeneration cycle. Seven knew she couldn't hide from B'Elanna forever and
had to apologize for her behavior but she wasn't ready to face the Klingon yet.
'Perhaps after my cycle is complete I will go to astrometrics and try to help find
what caused the phenomenon of the mysterious light.' Nothing like good old
avoidance. And with that, Seven stepped into the alcove intending to wake
during the gamma shift, long after B'Elanna is in bed. Little did Seven know
that B'Elanna had plans of her own.</p>

<p>&quot;Regeneration Cycle complete.&quot; The computer intoned.</p>

<p>Seven stepped out of the alcove, a seemingly unconscious act, and had yet to
open her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven? Are you okay?&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna who had been standing there for some time watching Seven 'sleep'
was concerned when Seven didn't open her eyes. She stepped closer to Seven and
put her hand on Seven's arm. That's when Seven opened her eyes to reveal their
golden color and smiled a very sexy smile down at B'Elanna showing her fangs.
For the second time in as many days, B'Elanna was dumb struck and could not
move or let alone think. She was surprised yet again when Seven grabbed her and
together the fell to the floor. Seven was now lying atop B'Elanna and sensually
moving her hands up and down the engineer's body. The only thing B'Elanna could
do was moan and arch her body into Seven's caresses. Seven was even more
aroused by B'Elanna's response and began to kiss her chin making her way down
to her neck ever so slowly. B'Elanna was in heaven and began to feel a tingle
all over her body. Briefly she opened her eyes and realized that the tingle was
actually caused by a transport and that she was now in sickbay. Soon after that
realization she saw the Doctor put a hypospray to Seven's neck and Seven fell
limply onto her body for a second time. 'I wish people would stop interfering'.
B'Elanna whined to herself. She really needed to have a talk with Seven, now
more than, ever but first they had to find a cure for her. And with that last
thought B'Elanna helped the Doctor lift Seven onto an empty biobed.</p>

<p>A second staff meeting in as many days had been called and again the senior
staff met without some of their co-workers present.</p>

<p>&quot;So why had Seven relapsed?&quot; Janeway shot a force ten glare at the
doctor.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Captain. It... uh.. seems she didn't relapse. She just never
fully recovered.&quot; The Doctor managed to stutter out. &quot;It seems that
during the day, Seven returned to her normal self but it was during the night
that she turned into a vampire.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But we don't even have night and day on this ship.&quot; Torres nearly
screamed out.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it seems that it only takes simulated light to effect what ever
virus is causing this. I really can't even explain why Seven might shy away
from the artificial light when she is a vampire. It's as if she was programmed
to do so, not so much that it is a natural aversion. And the only explanation I
could come up with as to why Seven changes back and forth is because she's not
a full vampire. She hasn't drunk anyone's blood yet. Right?&quot;</p>

<p>That last question was directed at B'Elanna for which she nodded her
agreement and then seemed to turn a light shade pink. The entire senior staff
now knew that for some reason Seven kept coming after her and for an even odder
reason B'Elanna wasn't complaining. The Captain reminded herself that she
certainly had to ask a few questions after this whole ordeal was over.</p>

<p>Speaking of this whole ordeal, they were still no closer to finding out what
was going on, how, why, or even a cure for this mess which made the Captain a very
frustrated Captain.</p>

<p>&quot;Doctor, what do you plan to do now?&quot; Tuvok asked, trying to keep
the conversation on track.</p>

<p>&quot;The only thing I can do is keep them under quarantine and sedated
until I can come up with a way to cure them. There's nothing else I can do for
them. And even with Seven, I don't think it's a good idea to have her roaming
around the ship during the day even if she is her normal self during that
time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, you can't do that. You're spoiling all my fun. Kathy, tell him he
can't do that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Q.&quot; Janeway jumped out of her seat to glare at the man now
standing directly behind her chair. &quot;We haven't seen you for a while,
should have known you would have gotten bored by now and decide to cause
trouble for us, again.&quot;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Janeway's level ten glare doesn't work on arrogant omnipotent
beings.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,.. yeah. And with this whole idea of Halloween and stuff I
thought it was a perfect way to come back in style. I thought it would be fun
to watch some of my old friends turn into what they pretended to be. Too bad
you changed out of your costume a little to early. It was after all quite
entertaining to watch, especially that Seven of Nine.&quot; Q said with a
wiggle of his eyebrows.</p>

<p>&quot;Why you, p'tach!&quot; Torres screamed as she jumped over the table to
grab Q only to land flat on her face as he disappeared and then reappeared at
the other end of the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Q, you had your fun and now the game is over whether or not you like
it. I will not release the affected crew members from sickbay until you cure
them. Your entertainment for the evening is over.&quot; Janeway managed through
gritted teeth as the others tried to hold Torres down.</p>

<p>Q had realized that his game was over the minute he appeared and so with one
way of his hand a bright light engulfed the ship again, blinding everyone for a
few seconds. As soon as the Captain regained her sight she looked to see where
Q was and as expected he was gone.</p>

<p>&quot;You win this time, Kathy but just remember, I get bored very
easily.&quot; The disembodied voice of Q carried over.</p>

<p>&quot;Great, just my luck&quot; the Captain mumbled. &quot;Doctor, go check
on your patients. I have a strange feeling they're completely healed right
about now&quot; she said in a stronger voice.</p>

<p>Both the Doctor and B'Elanna rushed out the door with Harry hot on their
heels. The Captain just slumped in her chair while Tuvok stood next to her.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think someday we could ever have a party or day off without
strange side effects occurring?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;While we remain in the Delta Quadrant, it is... unlikely.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed.&quot; Janeway smiled her agreement, &quot;Only in the Delta
Quadrant.&quot;</p>

<p>Down in sickbay the Doctor had just about finished running his scans and
releasing patients. He only had one more to go and that happened to be Seven.
B'Elanna stood off to the left while the Doctor completed his scans and soon
there after giving her a clean bill of health. Before Seven could hop down from
the biobed, B'Elanna stepped directly in front of her standing between her
legs.</p>

<p>&quot;Lieutenant?&quot; Seven questioned with her eyebrow quirked.</p>

<p>&quot;It's B'Elanna, Seven.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;B'Elanna&quot;. Seven tested out the name.</p>

<p>Even without Seven's voice being laced with desire the mere mention of her
name from Seven's lips seemed to cause chills to run down her back.</p>

<p>&quot;B'Elanna, I wish to...&quot;</p>

<p>Seven was cut short by B'Elanna placing her fingers over Seven's lips.</p>

<p>&quot;Shh. I don't want an apology. I just wanted to let you know that I
understand. It wasn't really you acting that way, just another of Q's games. I
don't hold anything against you. In fact I think I should be the one apologizing
here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, for kissing you back, I guess. You may have had an excuse but I
didn't and, well, I'm sorry.&quot; B'Elanna rushed through her apology.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not accept.&quot; Seven whispered.</p>

<p>&quot;What?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not regret you kissing me and therefore do not wish for an
apology for your actions. Now if you'll excuse me the Doctor has instructed me
to 'rest'.&quot; Seven said more forcefully trying to hide true feelings.</p>

<p>Seven jumped down from the biobed and brushed past B'Elanna. Seven was
already out the door before B'Elanna realized what Seven had just essentially
told her.</p>

<p>&quot;Kahless!&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna rushed out to meet Seven and just barely caught up with her inside
the turbolift before the doors closed. Seven was surprised when B'Elanna had
followed her but was totally shocked when B'Elanna pushed Seven up against the
wall and stood so close to Seven that she cold feel B'Elanna breath on her
neck.</p>

<p>&quot;I never said I regretted the kiss either.&quot;</p>

<p>And with that said, B'Elanna leaned in to kiss Seven. And it was the most
intense, passionate kiss B'Elanna had ever experienced. All of their passions
seemed to travel through that one kiss. Before both knew it their tongues were
dueling for the right of possession. Even though both had run out of breath the
kiss somehow continued until the turbolift lurched to a stop. Breaking the kiss
Seven whispered,</p>

<p>&quot;I must return to the cargo bay to regenerate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The last time we did this I promised that next time we wouldn't be
interrupted. Stay with me.&quot; B'Elanna suggested with a smile. Seven
returned the smile and leaned down to put a chaste kiss on B'Elanna's lips.</p>

<p>&quot;Deck three.&quot; B'Elanna ordered and as the doors closed, leaned
into Seven.</p>

<p>B'Elanna sighed in content and for the first time allowed herself to breath
in Seven's scent. It was almost sweet and smelled of distant lilacs but there
was also a very slight metallic tinge to it but B'Elanna found that all the
more delectable. Seven wrapped her arms around B'Elanna and found it
surprisingly easy for her to just hold B'Elanna close. Looking back, B'Elanna
realised that she couldn't remember a time when she hated the ex-drone. True
their relationship was antagonistic but it was just a way to release pent up
passions. In fact her's and Tom's relationship started out the same way, they
were just too different. 'But what if it ends the same way too?' B'Elanna's
little voice piped up. And in that moment B'Elanna realized that this time was
going to be different, not just about passions but....</p>

<p>&quot;Seven?&quot; B'Elanna looked into questioning eyes. &quot;I love
you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I believe I love you too, B'Elanna Torres.&quot;</p>

<p>Seven smile a huge smile, one that no one had ever thought the ex-borg
capable of and wrapped her arms around B'Elanna tighter. Just then the
turbolift doors opened and Tom Paris as well as Jennifer Delaney got to see
something they never thought possible.</p>

<p>&quot;Tom.&quot; B'Elanna nodded politely.</p>

<p>&quot;Lieutenant Paris, Ensign Delaney.&quot; Seven greeted as she walked
past.</p>

<p>&quot;Lanna?&quot; Tom croaked, unable to believe his eyes.</p>

<p>B'Elanna had stopped hoping to clear the air right here and now but Seven
just kept walking. B'Elanna was about to go after her when Tom spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;You and the ice queen? You left me for her?&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna slammed Paris into the wall, fed up with him and his snide remarks.
Not having the time or the will to deal with Tom, B'Elanna answered with one
word.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>Dropping Tom to the floor, B'Elanna headed off to go find Seven.</p>

<p>&quot;Computer, locate Seven of Nine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Seven of Nine is in B'Elanna Torres's quarters.&quot;</p>

<p>B'Elanna left a stunned Tom behind a half run toward her quarters.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on Tom, I'll help you forget about her.&quot; Jennifer said as
she helped Tom off the floor.</p>

<hr>

<p>Entering her quarters, the first thing B'Elanna noticed was Seven actually
sitting on her couch. At this point B'Elanna had become very concerned so she
knelt in front of Seven and stroked some loose strand of blond hair out of the
drone's eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Seven, why'd you run? What's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>And that's when Seven let all of her fears be known. &quot;You may go back
to Mr. Paris if you wish. I will understand. He is the better mate. More of the
crew accept him, he is physically attractive, and more human than I will ever
be.&quot;</p>

<p>It was the closest thing to babbling that Seven had shown.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you done yet?&quot; B'Elanna said with a smile and all Seven could
do was nod vigorously. &quot;Good because I'd like to set a few things
straight. First, I do not want Tom back. Jennifer can have him for all I care,
I got what I want right here. And as for the crew liking him better, well then
they can have him. And did you know you were voted the most gorgeous person
aboard Voyager? Well okay maybe not 'voted' but everyone thinks so including
me. And I certainly think that you have definitely surpassed Tom Paris in the
more humane category. Seven you are the most honest, loyal, passionate, caring,
funny, intelligent, beautiful, and innocent person I know. And if I truly
thought hard and long, I bet there was not one time when I didn't admire you or
your skills. I may not have shown my true feelings for everyone to see but then
again neither did you. We are so much alike with just enough difference thrown
in to make things interesting, not difficult. And I promise in the future to
show you just how much I do love and admire you, Seven. And I do love you Seven
of Nine.&quot;</p>

<p>For the second time since being severed from the collective, Seven was
crying.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For what?&quot; B'Elanna asked busy trying to wipe the tears from the
face she adored.</p>

<p>&quot;For loving me. I love you too. More than I ever thought
possible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, didn't the doctor say you need some rest?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, he thought it would be best for me to 'take it easy' for the next
few days.&quot; Seven answered as B'Elanna took her hand and lead her to the en
suite.</p>

<p>&quot;So, have you gotten any better at that sleeping thing since your last
attempt?&quot;</p>

<p>And with that B'Elanna and Seven slipped out of sight and into the bedroom.</p>
