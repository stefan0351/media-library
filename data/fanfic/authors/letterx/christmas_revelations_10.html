<!-- Christmas Revelations \ Part 10 -->

<p>According to the old Earth calendar, not only was it four days later and
B'Elanna's release date but it was also Dec. 25, Christmas Day. Neither Tuvok
nor the Captain had planned it that way but it turned out to be a nice
Christmas present for Lanna. Seven had been by to visit only once and that was
the day before. It seemed that with B'Elanna locked up in the brig Seven now
had double the work load. Not only did she have her duties in astrometrics but
now she had to pick up the slack in engineering left by the absence of it's
chief engineer. This left Lanna with plenty of time to think. The engineer
thought about how complete and how happy her life was now. Not only did she
have her family and friends around her in a place that she could truly call
home but now she had found the love of her life. But Seven hadn't been the only
visitor that Torres had received. Two days before, Neelix had showed up to
check on the reclusive half Klingon. He had asked about how she was doing which
was to be expected but what wasn't expected was when he asked what B'Elanna was
getting Seven for Christmas. Of course it had to be something big but what do
you get an ex-borg for Christmas. Neelix made a couple of suggestions but
nothing seemed just right. So finally he just suggested going around to the
rest of the crew collecting replicator rations form everyone and leaving the
final decision up to Lanna. Neelix rationalized that the rest of the crew still
owed Seven a gift and if B'Elanna finally decided on something he was sure it
was going to be big and expensive. Thank Kahless, Lanna had to spend four days
in the brig other wise she may never have come up with an idea for Seven's
gift.</p>

<p>Torres was scheduled to leave the brig at 1300 hours, right in the middle of
the alpha shift. The only person she might have expected to see at that time
was Seven of Nine. But thanks to a friendly Vulcan in engineering she was
almost guaranteed that Seven would be kept busy. Thanks, of course, to a few
logical distractions which Seven could not turn away from. In fact, that same
friendly Vulcan also guaranteed that Seven would be kept busy for the next
three hours of her shift and then one extra hour after that all with the help
of a few other friends. Now Lanna just had to make sure she set up her gift for
Seven in time. Her first stop was the mess-hall, to pick up the pad of rations
Neelix promised to get her. Then it was on to the Cargo Bay.</p>

<p>Arriving at the Cargo bay, B'Elanna's first order of business was to get rid
of Icheb. She sent him to go see the Captain, who would keep him busy for quite
a while (her Christmas gift to Seven). Next it was onto decorating the bay.
Lanna took a page from Seven's book and replicated a whole lot of Christmas
decorations. Using red bows and silver garlands, the engineer decorated the
bare walls. Mingled in were Christmas balls of all colours and gold tinsel
thrown about. A christmas tree already stood off to the side, replicated and
decorated by Icheb (his gift to Seven). The next order of business was to get
Chakotay and Harry to carry in a small couch and small coffee table retrieved
from storage. Lanna set up the couch in front of the dais and placed the table
in front of that. Next the engineer brought in a small cardboard fireplace
created and designed by Sam Wildman, the Doc, and Naomi. That was placed
directly across form the couch. The fireplace may not have been real but it
certainly brought a more homey look to the Cargo Bay. Then Lanna had to
replicate a few presents for Seven and when that was done she set them down
under the coffee table just waiting to be opened. There was now less then a
half an hour left and a few minor additions to be made. That's when Neelix
showed up with young Naomi in tow. Neelix handed over the plate full of
Christmas cookies he made just the way B'Elanna had instructed him to. Naomi
handed over a children's version of the Christmas classic A Christmas Carole by
Charles Dickens. But before Neelix or the little Katarian could ask any
questions Lanna quickly escorted them out of the bay.</p>

<p>Just as the Lt. had made some of the final adjustments Seven walked into
what used to be her Cargo Bay. Seven had realized that something was up
throughout her entire engineering shift. The way everyone was overly friendly
towards her and trying to distract her by engaging her in idle conversations.
Even though Seven knew they were distractions, she didn't know how to stop them
not being as socially adept as she wished she was. But what really bothered her
was the knowing smirks everyone kept giving her like they were keeping her out
of some sort of secret that everyone else knew about but her. Walking into the
bay she now knew what everything was all about. To say Seven was shocked was an
understatement. Even though Seven had done something similar for the crew it
had been all a holgraphic fantasy but this was all real.</p>

<p>&quot;How?... Why?...&quot; Was all Seven could squeak out.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, the decorating was easy and thanks to the crew, done just the
way I envisioned it. But tying to figure out a perfect Christmas gift for you
was something else.&quot; Lanna said as she walked over to the couch. Both
women sat down and B'Elanna leaned over to give Seven a quick kiss on the lips.
&quot;Merry Christmas Seven.&quot; Seven looked up to see where the mistletoe
was but this time she didn't find any. Lanna just smiled. &quot;As for the why,
well, because you deserve it more than anyone I know. While you were able to
give the crew a Christmas they would never forget you neglected to make this
Christmas special for you. I made a promise to myself then to make this your
first happy and memorable Christmas. So how about we open your presents.&quot;
Lanna concluded feeling foolish for saying too much.</p>

<p>Seven nodded and picked up the first present. As she opened it Lanna
explained what it was and why she was giving it to the ex-drone. &quot;That
there are three picture frames. In each frame is a picture of your new
collective or family. The first being the Captain who saved you from the
collective and who was the first to trust in you. The second is of Naomi who
has now become such a constant, loving, and loyal friend to you. And the third
being Icheb, the latest edition to your family unit.&quot; Seven then picked up
the next box to open as B'Elanna took away the pictures and placed them on the
table. &quot;These here are empty picture frames which you can add pictures to
as your family grows. Open that next box there. That's a, umm, picture of me. I
was hoping that soon you'd like to add that to your collection of
pictures.&quot; Lanna finished shyly.</p>

<p>&quot;Lanna, that should have been the first picture you placed in a frame.
You are the love of my life and the person I wish to now build my family
around. I love you. Thank you.&quot; Seven leaned over and placed one of the
most softest, sweetest kisses on Lanna's lips. The Lt. now had one of the most
goofiest grins on her face but continued on anyway.</p>

<p>&quot;Someone had mentioned to me recently how much they love it when you
sign them to sleep so I thought that this children's song book might come in
handy.&quot; Lanna had to clear her throat before explaining the next gift.
&quot;It's a, a book on Klingon Human mating. I was kind of hoping that one
would come in handy as well.&quot; Lanna finished in a rush.</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed.&quot; And that confession deserved a passion filled kiss
delivered from Seven's heart directly to Lanna's leaving her feeling
light-headed and breathless. &quot;Thank you Lanna for already making this
Christmas a happy and special one for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, it's not over yet.&quot; Lanna moved the presents out of the way
and reached over the table to grab the plate full of cookies handing it to
Seven. &quot;Here, try this. Trust me. It tastes great, I taste tested it
before you came in.&quot; Lanna then sat laying across the couch pulling Seven
to lean back into her wrapping her arms around the ex-borg. Seven tried the
cookies and in one moment realised the pleasures of taste. Lanna then reached
over and grabbed the book that lay on the table.</p>

<p>&quot;There's milk there to wash down the cookies if you want. And now for
my last gift to you. This here is a Christmas classic. A book called A
Christmas Carole by Charles Dickens. I believe that everyone at the academy was
required to read this but I was introduced to this by my father. One Christmas
day he took me in his lap just like this and told me he was going to read this
story to me. We read a few chapters that Christmas and then a few more the next.
It became sort of a Christmas tradition between us. But I never got to finish
the book because he soon there after left us. I was never inclined to pick it
up again, too many memories I guess but now I think I might want to continue
that tradition with you. That is if you wouldn't mind me reading to you. I'd
like to find out how this ends right along with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Please.&quot; Seven whispered squeezing Lanna' hand to reassure her
that this was the best idea for a gift she could ever ask for.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright then. A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens....&quot;</p>

<p>And so B'Elanna began to read to Seven the Christmas classic beginning a new
tradition between the two women that both were determined to see through to the
end.</p>
