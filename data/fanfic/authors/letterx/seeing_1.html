<!-- Seeing for the First Time \ Part 1 -->

<P>"How is she Doctor?"</P>

<P>"It looks like she'll pull through."</P>

<P>"Doctor.  If you are being vague about a medical prognosis I know it must be bad.  I want the truth.  Again I ask, how is she?"</P>

<P>"If you insist, Captain.  I was able to heal all of Seven's external injuries as well as most of her internal injuries; broken bones, dislocated shoulder and hip, internal bleeding, lacerations on the face and neck, various burn marks, as well as repaired a scarred trachea. Seven may have a raspy voice for a few days but will nonetheless be able to speak.  It really wasn't as bad as I had first thought.  Thanks to her borg enhanced skeletal system as well as a padded spacesuit, the space debris field she got knocked around in didn't do as much damage as it had seemed."</P>

<P>"But.....?"</P>

<P>"But the radiation did. Thanks to the delayed explosion of the other ship's warp core, Seven was exposed to severe gamma radiation as well as high levels of unstable anti-matter core mixture particles.  The former of which caused severe radiation burns all over her body.  Unfortunately the spacesuit wasn't able or equipped to protect her from such levels of radiation.  I was able to repair all of the damage the gamma radiation caused thanks to some help from her nanoprobes but....."</P>

<P>"Again with the but.  Doctor, please, just tell me what's wrong with Seven."</P>

<P>"But the anti-matter poisoning was a little more problematic.  There's a component in the mixture which can adversely affect ocular functions. Due to Seven's exposure to such high levels of this material her cornea's were seared."</P>

<P>"So what you're saying is that Seven's blind."</P>

<P>"Unfortunately, yes.  At least for the time being.  There are a few surgeries in which I could perform to try and repair the damage done but I can not predict if they will be successful or not.  In fact there is a very low probability of them being successful but I am willing to try. There's very little risk involved as Seven is already blind so I don't see any reason not to go through with the procedures.  I just don't want to get anyone's hopes up.  There is a very good chance that Seven will never regain her sight again."</P>

<P>"But what about her left eye?  Isn't that a borg implant?  Shouldn't she still be able to see out of that eye?"</P>

<P>"In this case no.  Seven's left eyeball although attached to an implant still inside the socket which allows for the borg enhancements is still made out of organic material.  When first assimilated Seven's left eye was removed in order to add the implant that covered that eye but once she came aboard Voyager and I removed that eye piece I had to create a new eyeball for that socket.  I replicated the eye using organic tissues attaching it to the socket and then in turn with the inner implant.  The eye therefore still has the added enhancements caused by the implants but nonetheless is still a human eye.  And in this case, regardless of the implant, Seven's corneas were scorched creating a sort of black covering over the visual lens of the eye.  Technically speaking Seven should still be able to see but can't due to this cover causing total blindness."</P>

<P>"Does Seven know?"  Whispered a very subdued captain.</P>

<P>"No, as soon as Seven was stabilized I had to enclose her in a bio-regeneration unit so as to assist her nanoprobes of clearing out the rest of the radiation from her body.  By tomorrow it should all be gone and I'll be waking her up.  I suppose I'll give her the news then."</P>

<P>"No, I'll do it Doctor.  Just call me before you wake her and I'll be here." </P>

<P>The Doctor nodded solemnly and headed back into his office to finish updating his medical files.  Janeway now left alone with Seven, slowly made her way to the biobed in which she laid encased in the bio-unit. Reaching out, Kathryn pressed her hand firmly against the glass paneling of the unit.  It's cold starkness a reminder of all that was almost lost.  She wished with all her might that she could just hold Seven at this very moment.  Comfort her and make everything all better.  But she couldn't could she?</P>

<P>"I'm so sorry Seven.  I shouldn't have let you board that other ship.  I knew I had a bad feeling about this but I listened to your pleas. You wanted to beam over there and rescue those people, those erratic, faint life signs the computer somehow picked up.  You knew you could save them and I knew you could have so I let you go.  I let you go alone cause you were the only one with all that borg ingenuity built right in but it was a mistake.  Those escape pods you found operational, you thought you had found those faint life signs.  You risked your life to get to them through that wall of fire that was so close to destroying them just to manually eject those pods into space cause the computer had failed to do so.  Then the warp core explodes and causes a chain reaction which sends you hurling out into space through an opening in the ship.  Thank god you were wearing your spacesuit.  I almost lost you then.  Ha, I almost lost you a second time when I couldn't get a lock on you to beam you out.  The radiation had come up so quickly and interfered with all of our systems.  The only thing I could do was watch helplessly as your body got tossed around in the debris field as wave after shock wave pummelled your body.  I had to wait until you cleared the radiation but we finally got to you.  We got you out.  But how do I tell you it was all for nothing?  How do I tell you that you may be blinded for life for trying to save already dead bodies in those escape pods?  Those bio-signatures we picked up were false Seven.  You risked your life and possibly gave up your sight for people who were already dead.  I'm so sorry."</P>

<P>"Captain?"</P>

<P>"Tom.  What is it?"</P>

<P>"Chakotay wants to see you in the ready room. He really didn't want to disturb you by hailing you but since I was heading down here anyway I told him I'd deliver the message.  I thought I'd come and check up on Seven and see if there was anything I could do."</P>

<P>"I don't think there's much anyone can do right now Tom but check with the Doctor anyway.  And thanks for the message."  Janeway cast a glance at the sleeping form of Seven of Nine.  The only thing really left to do now was to pray.</P>

<P>""You know, Seven's been through so much already and yet she still seems to be forced to deal with more trying times.  It's just not right.  Even if I can't help with any of the medical stuff you can bet that I will find a way to help her through this even if it is just to be a friend who listens to her woes.  I owe her my life and this would only be the beginning of my repayment for saving me.  And I'm not the only one who feels this way either.  After Seven had somehow managed to talk me down from my, um, suicide attempt she earned a lot of respect, admiration, and even friendship from a lot of the crew.  I was so distraught over Lanna leaving me and our divorce that I probably would have gone through with it if Seven didn't step in and talk with me.  And now that the roles might be reversed there's going to be a line of people just waiting to help her out but they'll all have to get behind me."</P>

<P>"Thank you Tom.  I'm sure Seven's going to need all of the help that she can get after she wakes up and hears what she's going to hear.  She may be able to get through the disappointment of not being able to save those people but I have no idea how she'll handle the fact that she may be blind because of it."</P>

<P>"What?!  Blind?!"</P>

<P>"I think that you should go talk with the Doctor now.  He'll fill you in on the rest.  In the mean time I should see what Chakotay needs."</P>

<P>And with that the unbeatable Captain Kathryn Janeway of the mighty starship Voyager left sickbay feeling like someone had just beaten the life right out of her.</P>

<P>FOUR DAYS LATER</P>

<P>"Hey Doc.  How is she?"</P>

<P>"Tom.  She's.... the same.  She refuses to 'function' and continuously asks to be deactivated as she is now a 'defective drone'.  &lt;sigh&gt; I really don't know what to do any more.  I have to literally force her to eat as she no longer sees fit to regenerate.  Good new is that now she sleeps but bad news is that she sleeps all day and all night.  She refuses to leave sickbay and refuses to do any work despite having the captain order her to do it.  She refuses to see anyone and poor Naomi has become so distraught over not being able to visit Seven.  Icheb now thinks that Seven does not like him any more as she even refuses to help him with his studies.  She just refuses to do anything because of the mere fact that she needs sight to do it.  She just sits there all day waiting for her life to just end as she deems herself to now be useless to this collective.  I never thought I'd see the day that Seven would partake in self pity.   But don't get me wrong, she still hides her emotions well and to the casual observer it would just seem like there's something off with Seven but I know her better.  She becomes easily angered and is very moody, well as moody and angry as an ex-borg drone tends to get.  I'm just not sure any more if anyone, let alone me, can get through to her.  I've tried everything I can think of, so has Janeway."</P>

<P>"Well, it's a good thing I came along when I did.  I'd like to give Seven a little present that I made and I think, or at least I hope, that this'll do the trick."</P>

<P>"Be my guest.  She should be occupying the last bio-bed as it seems that's her new home."</P>

<P>Tom nodded and smirked at the Doctor's frustration which was plainly seen through his sarcastic remarks.  And so as Tom exited the office he noticed Seven right where the Doc said she'd be.  She was sitting up on the bio-bed with her legs dangling off the edge 'looking' down at the floor.  Seven looked the way a child would look if she had lost her favorite stuffed animal but Paris knew this was more serious then that.</P>

<P>"Hey Seven.  How's it hanging."  Tom said in his most jovial manner.</P>

<P>"Hanging?"  Seven quirked her eyebrow.</P>

<P>"Just thought I'd teach you a new slang word or phrase a day.  Today's word - hanging.  Translation - going on or happening depending on how you use it in a sentence.  For example, how's it hanging.  Translation -what's going on or what's happening.  Now Seven, you have to use this word at least once today in your conversations."</P>

<P>"Indeed."  This time along with the raised eyebrow also came an slightly amused smirk.  Somehow Tom Paris always seemed to amuse Seven.</P>

<P>"There you go.  I knew you had it in you to turn that frown upside down."  At Seven's confused glance, Tom elaborated.  "Oops sorry that's tomorrow's new word."  And that earned an even bigger smile from Seven. "Now the Doc told me that lately you have been a real party pooper so I thought I'd just give you this little present to play with."  Tom reached for Seven left hand and places a small crystal in her open hand. Then her closed the hand into a fist making sure that Seven did not drop what it was that he had handed her.</P>

<P>"What is it?"</P>

<P>"Hmph.  Now wouldn't that just ruin the surprise.  You'll just have to figure it out for yourself.  Later Seven."  Tom threw over his shoulder as he walked out of sickbay.  He knew that thanks to some major borg curiosity Seven wouldn't be able to resist finding out what it was that he'd given her and that's what he was hoping for.  'Even if Seven gives me hell for this later, it'll be worth it just to have her get up and do something constructive and hopefully then in turn realize that being blind was not an all debilitating fact of life.'</P>
