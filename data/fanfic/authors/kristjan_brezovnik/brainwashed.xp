<chapter>
<p>Faith was lying in a hospital room that the hospital seemed to have forgotten. It was fitting somehow, that a forgotten Slayer should lie in a forgotten room. She was comatose, but that didn't mean that her mind was blank. Oh no, her mind was active, very active. She wished she could stop it, but she couldn't.</p>
<p>Nightmarish images mixed with brief moments of serenity, which always turned into nightmares again. Buffy was present in most of those peaceful moments, and when they ended, she almost always ended up hurting Buffy. And the nightmares, they were her life. Her childhood, the death of her first Watcher, the betrayal by Gwendolyn Post, the murder of Allan Finch, her betrayal of Buffy and Buffy stabbing her. There were also images of something else, of something she didn't remember. Those last images scared her the most.</p>
<p>They were vague at first, but they were becoming more and more clear, and scary. Until she finally remembered.</p>
<p>Then her eyes fluttered open. She lay still for a few moments, confused, but then her memory returned and she remembered everything, except those last images. She looked around and saw she was in some storage room or something. She got up and wanted to leave, but the IV stopped her. She tore out the tubes and left the room.</p>
<p>She was walking down the hall when the doors at the end opened and a young woman came through. Faith was worried for a few moments, but she calmed down when she saw it was just a young woman.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," the woman spoke. "You know how to get to third floor west?"</p>
<p>"What?" Faith asked, confused.</p>
<p>"I see... You need some help or something?"</p>
<p>"Graduation."</p>
<p>"What?" the woman said, puzzled.</p>
<p>"Graduation. I gotta get to Sunnydale High School graduation. Now!"</p>
<p>"Well, you can't. I mean, Sunnydale High School isn't even there anymore"</p>
<p>Faith frowned.</p>
<p>"What day is it?"</p>
<p>"Friday."</p>
<p>"What date? The date?"</p>
<p>"February 25th."</p>
<p>"What year?"</p>
<p>The woman realized that Faith needed help.</p>
<p>"Maybe I should get you a nurse," she suggested.</p>
<p>"What happened to the school?"</p>
<p>"Don't you just wanna..."</p>
<p>"Just tell me," Faith said, agitated.</p>
<p>"Well, it was a tragedy, really. Lots of students died. The Principal, the Mayor." She paused for a moment. "I really think I should get you some help."</p>
<p>Faith stared at her. She was feeling this urge to beat up the woman and take her clothes. But then she got a flash of the hidden memories and she got scared.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" the woman asked, concerned, when she saw Faith's face.</p>
<p>"Yeah, five by five," Faith said and hurried away before the impulse became too strong and she ended up beating the woman.</p>

<hr/>

<p>She ran down back alleys, avoiding people. She didn't know where to go, but then she finally decided to go back to the apartment the Mayor had bought her. She came across a few people and every time she felt the urge to beat them up and take their clothes. And every time, the memories became a bit clearer, and scarier. So she ran, as fast as she could.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Buffy and the Scoobs were at Giles' place discussing Adam when the phone rang. Giles answered it.</p>
<p>"Hello... What? Yes, she is." He motioned to Buffy. "Em, it's for you."</p>
<p>Buffy frowned, surprised, and went to the phone.</p>
<p>"Hello... What sort of emergency... No, I haven't... Thank you, I'll let you know."</p>
<p>"What is it?" Giles asked.</p>
<p>"It's Faith. She's awake. No one knows where she is."</p>
<p>"I'd say this qualifies for a "Worst Timing Ever" award," Xander said.</p>
<p>"What do we do?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"Well, we have to find her," Giles said.</p>
<p>"What about Adam?"</p>
<p>"I'd hate to see the pursuit of a homicidal lunatic get in the way of pursuing a homicidal lunatic," Xander said.</p>
<p>"Well, Faith's not exactly low-profile girl," Buffy said, "I'll patrol and wait for her to make a move."</p>
<p>"But then what?" Giles asked.</p>
<p>"Ooh! I have an idea! Beat the crap out of her!" Willow said animatedly.</p>
<p>"Good plan," Xander agreed.</p>
<p>"Good on paper," Buffy said. "But we still have a decision to make. Do we hand her over to the cops? They wouldn't know what to do with a Slayer even if they knew we existed."</p>
<p>"What about the Council?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"Been there, tried that," Xander said. "Not unlike smothering a forest fire with napalm as I recall."</p>
<p>"Well, the Initiative, they do have containment facilities," Giles suggested.</p>
<p>"One word: evil."</p>
<p>"There's no way around it," Buffy said. "Faith is back, and whether I like it or not, she's my responsibility."</p>
<p>"Yeah, too bad," Willow said."</p>
<p>"We have no idea where she is. We don't know what she's thinking, what she's feeling..."</p>
<p>"Who she's doing," Xander added.</p>
<p>"She could be terrified. Maybe she doesn't even remember. Or maybe she does and she's sorry and she's alone, hiding somewhere," Buffy said hopefully.</p>
<p>"Well, perhaps there's some form of rehabilitation we just haven't thought about," Giles said.</p>
<p>"And if not, ass-kicking makes a solid plan B," Willow said.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to rule it out," Buffy agreed. "First thing, we need to find her. Then we can take it from there."</p>
<p>"Who's Faith?" Riley asked innocently.</p>

<hr/>

<p>When after two days Faith still hasn't showed up, Buffy was getting worried, both about Faith and about what she might be up to. She talked to Spike, she talked to vamps, she talked to Willy, but no one had seen her. She even checked out all the bars and the motel, but Faith was not there. So finally, the only thing left was the apartment where they had last fought. She had hoped she wouldn't have to go there, but she didn't know where else to go.</p>
<p>She started feeling guilty all over again as she climbed the stairs. Everything was quiet. When she got to Faith's floor, she noticed that the door was slightly ajar. She carefully approached. She stopped for a moment when she reached the door. She took a deep breath and then peeked in. She didn't see Faith, but her senses were telling her that Faith was there. She gulped and slowly entered. She looked around, ready to fend off any attack. But when she saw Faith sitting by the bed, still wearing the hospital gown, hugging her knees, she stopped, surprised.</p>
<p>"Faith?" she asked, but Faith didn't respond.</p>
<p>Buffy hesitated for a moment and then went closer. She noticed that Faith's eyes were staring at nothing and that she was trembling.</p>
<p>"Faith," she called again.</p>
<p>Faith didn't respond and after a moment of hesitation kneeled beside her</p>
<p>"Faith," she said and gently shook her.</p>
<p>Faith jerked and her eyes focused. She looked at Buffy and when she realized who Buffy was, her eyes went wide. She backed off onto the bed and away from Buffy. Buffy could see it in her eyes that Faith was scared.</p>
<p>"I'm not gonna hurt you," she said and Faith laughed briefly, confusing Buffy.</p>
<p>"Stay away from me," Faith said.</p>
<p>"Faith..."</p>
<p>"Stay away!" Faith screamed when Buffy stepped closer.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay," Buffy said and took a step backwards.</p>
<p>Faith calmed a bit and backed off toward the wall. She took a few deep breaths to calm down. She gulped and ran her hand through her hair.</p>
<p>"What did they do to me?" she finally asked in a quiet voice.</p>
<p>Buffy frowned, puzzled.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"They... They... did something to me," Faith said. "It hurt."</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"They... I don't know... Doctors."</p>
<p>"Doctors?" Buffy said, confused. "They healed you. They..."</p>
<p>"No, not now, before."</p>
<p>"Before?"</p>
<p>"Before I came here. They did something," Faith said, trying to remember Then she looked at Buffy. "H-Help me," she said and a few tears slid down her cheeks. "P-Please."</p>
<p>The look in Faith's eyes scared Buffy, it was the same look she had seen in Angel's eyes when he came back from Hell. She took a deep breath, hoping that Faith wasn't acting.</p>
<p>"Can I come closer?"</p>
<p>Faith hesitated, uncertain, and then nodded.</p>
<p>"But be c-careful."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"B-Because I-I don't w-wanna hurt you."</p>
<p>"Why would you?" Buffy asked, puzzled, as she slowly approached Faith.</p>
<p>"I-I don't kn-know. S-some-t-time I get this u-urge to k-kill."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>Faith hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>"B-Buffy?"</p>
<p>"Yes?" Buffy said, surprised that Faith had used her whole name.</p>
<p>"I-I'm s-sorry," Faith said, looking down, ashamed, as a few more tears ran down her cheeks.</p>
<p>Buffy hesitated for a moment and then slowly reached out with her hand and lifted Faith's chin.</p>
<p>"Look at me," she said softly when Faith avoided looking into her eyes.</p>
<p>Faith gulped, hesitating, and then finally forced herself to look into Buffy's eyes. The look almost broke Buffy's heart.</p>
<p>"I'll help you," she said after a few moments and Faith breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>"Th-Thank y-you," she said and Buffy realized that Faith was sincere.</p>
<p>"Do you have anything to wear?" she asked.</p>
<p>Faith looked at herself and realized she was still wearing the hospital gown.</p>
<p>"Oh." She looked up. "I-I think so."</p>
<p>She hesitated for a moment and then went to the closet. She rummaged through it and took out a set of clothes. She started to undress, but then remembered that Buffy was still there.</p>
<p>"Em, c-could you..."</p>
<p>Buffy realized what she meant and she found it... strange that Faith was suddenly so shy. She started to turn around when she realized that showing her back to Faith might not be the wisest idea.</p>
<p>"I-It's okay," Faith said, having guessed what was on Buffy's mind.</p>
<p>She turned around and started to take off the gown. Buffy hesitated for a moment, but then she turned, all the while listening to the sounds Faith was making.</p>
<p>Faith quickly dressed and when she turned around, she saw that Buffy had her back toward her.</p>
<p>"No," she said as she fought the urge to hurt Buffy.</p>
<p>"What?" Buffy said and turned, only to see Faith backing off.</p>
<p>"I-I'm ha-having this u-urge again," Faith said.</p>
<p>"Can you control it?"</p>
<p>Faith hesitated for a moment and then nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Buffy thought about what to do next.</p>
<p>"Pack your stuff," she then said.</p>
<p>Faith frowned but did as she was told. The packing didn't take long and a couple of minutes later, she was ready. She looked at Buffy expectantly.</p>
<p>"Wh-Where are we going?" she asked anxiously.</p>
<p>Buffy hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>"Home."</p>
<p>Faith's eyes went wide.</p>
<p>"Y-Your home?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"A-Are you sure?" Faith asked and gulped. "I-I mean..."</p>
<p>"I'm sure," Buffy said. "Mom likes you and I know she'll want to help you."</p>
<p>"B-But what if can't c-control m-myself?"</p>
<p>"Scream and run away."</p>
<p>Faith thought about it.</p>
<p>"Okay," she finally said.</p>
<p>"Come."</p>
<p>Faith hesitated for a moment and then followed Buffy.</p>

<hr/>

<p>"Mom!" Buffy called when she and Faith came home.</p>
<p>"Yes, honey?" Joyce said as she came from the kitchen. "Faith," she said, surprised, to see the girl.</p>
<p>"Hi," Faith said nervously and looked down.</p>
<p>"Buffy?" Joyce asked.</p>
<p>"She wants my help," Buffy explained. "Can she stay here?"</p>
<p>Joyce looked at Faith, thinking.</p>
<p>"Do you want to stay here, Faith?" she asked.</p>
<p>Faith looked at her, surprised.</p>
<p>"I-I don't know. B-Buffy said I c-could," she said, glancing at Buffy.</p>
<p>"At least she wouldn't be alone, Mom," Buffy pleaded.</p>
<p>Joyce hesitated for a moment and then sighed.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Mom," Buffy said, relieved.</p>
<p>"Thank y-you," Faith said quietly.</p>
<p>"Come, let me show you to your room," Buffy said and led Faith upstairs. "Here," she said when the got to the room. "We'll have to change the sheets and... What's wrong?" she asked when she noticed that Faith's face had paled and that she was backing off. "Faith?"</p>
<p>Faith swallowed hard.</p>
<p>"While I was in c-coma, I-I had dream... We w-were changing sh-sheets and you... stabbed me. A-and when the Boss and I h-had a p-picnic, you chased me a-and I ended up... k-killing you."</p>
<p>"Oh," Buffy said, thinking. "Well, I'm not going to stab you, if that's what you're worried about."</p>
<p>Faith took a deep breath and forced herself to step into the room.</p>
<p>"We have another spare room," Buffy said.</p>
<p>Faith sighed and shook her head.</p>
<p>"It's okay," she said.</p>
<p>"You sure?"</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah." She looked at Buffy. "Thanks."</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Are you hungry?"</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"I'll tell Mom to make something."</p>
<p>"No, that's not necessary."</p>
<p>"You haven't eaten since you left the hospital."</p>
<p>"I-I..."</p>
<p>"You need food, Faith."</p>
<p>Faith sighed and nodded.</p>
<p>"Well, settle in. We'll change the sheets as soon as I get back."</p>
<p>Faith nodded and Buffy left. Faith looked around the room and then went to the bed and sat on it. The way the room looked just like in her dream was really freaky, but she decided to face her fear.</p>

<hr/>

<p>"Mom?" Buffy said as she entered the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Faith hasn't eaten since she left the hospital. Can you make her something?"</p>
<p>"Sure." Joyce hesitated for a moment. "How is she?"</p>
<p>Buffy thought about it.</p>
<p>"She's scared. She believes some doctors did something to her."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Yes. But she can't remember what it was." She hesitated for a moment. "She even apologized."</p>
<p>"That's good, isn't it?"</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes." She sighed. "Damn, we still have to take care of the police."</p>
<p>"What will you do about it?"</p>
<p>Buffy took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"I don't know. I'll have to talk to the guys."</p>
<p>"Do they know about Faith?"</p>
<p>"No, we came straight here." She hesitated for a moment. "I'm worried about how Willow and Xander will react to it, they're not very fond of her."</p>
<p>"Maybe you should talk to them before they meet her," Joyce suggested.</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I'll go to Giles' place later. We'll change the sheets in Faith's room now."</p>
<p>"Okay, honey."</p>

<hr/>

<p>As they changed the sheets, Buffy made sure she wasn't too close to Faith, not only because she still didn't completely trust her, but she also didn't want to make Faith jumpy.</p>
<p>"I'll go tell the guys later," she said as they finished.</p>
<p>Faith looked at her and nodded.</p>
<p>"You okay with that?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah, they h-have to find out." She hesitated for a moment. "How do y-you think they'll r-react?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I think Willow and Xander will the most upset."</p>
<p>Faith frowned.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>Buffy shrugged.</p>
<p>"I don't know. They're afraid of you, I guess."</p>
<p>"Oh." She thought for a moment. "Do... Do you know where h-he's buried?"</p>
<p>"He? Finch."</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"No, I don't."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"I'll find out," she said and Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"Okay." She hesitated for a moment. "A-And P-Professor W-Wirth."</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Him too." She thought for a moment. "Are you gonna be okay alone with my mom?"</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I guess so."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>

<hr/>

<p>"Have you found her yet?" Xander asked when Buffy came to Giles' place.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"You have?" Xander said, surprised. "Where is she? What happened?"</p>
<p>"She's at my place."</p>
<p>There was silence.</p>
<p>"Did you just say she was at your place?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Oh. I thought... She's at your place?!"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"In chains, I assume."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, no?"</p>
<p>"She's not in chains." Buffy looked at Giles. "Is it possible that the Council did something to her?"</p>
<p>"Like what?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. She was pretty scared when I found her. She said some doctors did something to her before she came here."</p>
<p>"And you assume it's the Council?"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't put it past them."</p>
<p>Giles thought for a moment.</p>
<p>"I don't know. And I don't think it would be wise to ask until we know more."</p>
<p>"So you left Faith alone in your house?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"No, she's with Mom."</p>
<p>"You left her alone with your mom?! Buffy, she's dangerous! She..."</p>
<p>"She's sorry."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"She said she was sorry."</p>
<p>"And you believe her?"</p>
<p>"Yes. She was terrified, I could see it in her eyes. And she asked me to help her."</p>
<p>"And you said yes?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," Buffy said, getting slightly annoyed.</p>
<p>"But she..."</p>
<p>"I know what she did, Willow," Buffy interrupted her, "you don't have to remind me."</p>
<p>"Are you sure she is sincere?" Giles asked.</p>
<p>"Yes. Look, I know she's a good actress, but this time she was sincere. Whatever happened to her is scaring her."</p>
<p>"And she has no idea what?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"How convenient," Xander said.</p>
<p>"Look, just give her a chance, okay? What if it is true? If the Council did something to her, they could do the same to me."</p>
<p>"She d-does have a p-point," Tara said and Willow looked at her, surprised.</p>
<p>"See?" Buffy said. "And what if she has really changed? We could use another Slayer when we go against Adam."</p>
<p>"And what if she hasn't?" Willow said.</p>
<p>"Yeah, what if she comes after us?" Xander added.</p>
<p>"She won't."</p>
<p>"You don't know that."</p>
<p>"I do." She sighed. "Look, I'll make a quick patrol and then I'm gonna go home." She looked at Giles. "I'll let you know how it goes."</p>
<p>Giles nodded.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>"Good. I'll see you around."</p>

<hr/>

<p>After Buffy had left, Faith was at a loss as to what to do. She went to her room and stayed there for a while, but then she got bored and she went downstairs. Joyce was in the kitchen and she didn't really feel like talking to her. So she sat on the sofa and turned on the TV. Joyce came to check out the noise a few moments later and Faith got worried for a moment, but Joyce just smiled when she saw her, and returned to the kitchen. Faith heaved a sigh of relief and returned to watching TV.</p>
<p>But, unfortunately, most of the things on TV caused bad memories for her, either an action movie, a CNN update on some war, a medical show or even a cartoon. The flashbacks returned and Faith found herself in a loop of painful memories.</p>
<p>When Joyce left the kitchen a few minutes later, she found Faith staring at the TV, trembling.</p>
<p>"Faith?" she asked, but Faith didn't respond. "Faith, are you okay?" she asked again, concerned, and stepped closer.</p>
<p>Faith didn't respond, so Joyce slowly approached her. She noticed that Faith's hands were balled into fists and that her eyes were staring at nothing. She hesitated for a moment and then gently shook Faith.</p>
<p>"Faith..."</p>
<p>Faith shrieked and backed off from the startled Joyce. It took her a few moments to realize where she was and who Joyce was.</p>
<p>"S-Sorry," she mumbled and looked away.</p>
<p>Joyce slowly approached her and Faith tensed.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" she asked.</p>
<p>"F-Five by f-five," Faith said, avoiding Joyce's eyes.</p>
<p>"Faith."</p>
<p>Faith gulped and forced herself to look at Joyce.</p>
<p>"It's okay," Joyce said. "You're hurt, you don't have to pretend that you're not," she said and smiled softly. "It's okay to cry," she added.</p>
<p>Faith touched her cheeks and saw that they were wet. Then she noticed the blood on her hands and she started shaking again.</p>
<p>"Oh my god, you're bleeding," Joyce said, having also noticed the blood. "Faith?" she said, noticing that Faith was trembling.</p>
<p>She gently touched Faith's shoulder again and Faith jerked.</p>
<p>"I didn't mean it! It was an accident!" she screamed.</p>
<p>"Faith, it's okay," Joyce said and covered Faith's hands. "Faith, look at me."</p>
<p>Faith did and Joyce was shocked by the look in her eyes.</p>
<p>"It was an accident," she said and Faith nodded. "Come, let's go take care of your hands."</p>
<p>She let go of Faith's hands and got up. Faith hesitated for a moment and then got up as well. Joyce started for the stairs and Faith slowly followed her.</p>
<p>"Wash your hands," Joyce said when they got to the bathroom.</p>
<p>Faith hesitated for a moment and then approached the sink and washed the blood off her hands. Joyce then looked at her palms, where the wounds from Faith's nails were already healing.</p>
<p>"Do you want me to put on a bandage?" she asked.</p>
<p>Faith shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, it's okay," she said in a raspy voice.</p>
<p>"Are you sure?"</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, they've already healed."</p>
<p>"Okay." Joyce hesitated for a moment. "Do you want to talk about it?"</p>
<p>Faith gulped and looked away, nervous.</p>
<p>"About what?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, whatever you want."</p>
<p>Faith took a deep breath to calm down a bit.</p>
<p>"No, not yet," she said.</p>
<p>"Okay. If you change your mind, don't hesitate to ask."</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Joyce smiled a bit and then turned to leave.</p>
<p>"Mrs S-Summers?" Faith called after her.</p>
<p>Joyce turned back.</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>Faith hesitated for a moment, gulping.</p>
<p>"Th-Thanks."</p>
<p>Joyce smiled.</p>
<p>"You're welcome," she said and left.</p>
<p>Faith closed her eyes and sighed. Then she looked at the mirror. She felt like smashing it, but she controlled herself and quickly left.</p>

<hr/>

<p>When Buffy came home, she went to her mother, who was in the living room</p>
<p>"Mom?"</p>
<p>Joyce looked at her with a smile.</p>
<p>"Hi, honey."</p>
<p>"Where's Faith?"</p>
<p>"She's taking a shower."</p>
<p>"Oh. Was everything okay?"</p>
<p>"Most of the time."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Buffy asked, worried.</p>
<p>"Well, I found her here, staring at nothing, and when I touched her, she... freaked. She was scared. And when she saw the blood on her hands, she... zoned out again."</p>
<p>"Blood? What blood?"</p>
<p>"She dug her nails into her palms."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"She calmed down, but I'm worried that she might have a nightmare tonight."</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"I'll leave my door open."</p>

<hr/>

<p>After Faith was finished showering, she went to her room. Buffy considered talking to her right away, but she decided to shower first. When she was done, she dressed into her sleeping clothes and went to Faith's room. She knocked, but there was no response.</p>
<p>"Faith?" she said and knocked again.</p>
<p>There was no response, so she slowly opened the door and peeked in.</p>
<p>"Faith?" she said when she saw Faith sitting on the bed, hugging her knees. "Faith!" she called.</p>
<p>Faith jerked and looked at her and Buffy could see that she had been going down the memory lane again.</p>
<p>"You okay?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"F-Five... No," Faith said.</p>
<p>"May I come in?"</p>
<p>Faith frowned first, surprised that Buffy was asking for her permission, and then nodded. Buffy entered the room and approached the bed. She hesitated for a moment and then sat down.</p>
<p>"Wanna talk about it?" she asked.</p>
<p>Faith sighed and hugged her knees tighter. She leaned her head on her knees and thought about the offer.</p>
<p>"I-I don't know what to s-say," she finally said, avoiding Buffy's eyes. "I m-mean, you were trying to be there for m-me and I screwed you over and b-betrayed you. And I'm still not s-sure why. I didn't want to, b-but... I don't know." She thought for a moment. "I kept having a feeling that I should... hurt you, but I didn't want to. But I did. A-And while I was in coma, I kept having these memory flashes, but when I woke up, I couldn't remember anymore." She sighed. "All I know is that someone did something to me." She gulped. "And every time I start to remember, I just... freak. I'm tired, but I'm afraid to go to sleep, because I know I'll either dream of what they did to me or of what I did."</p>
<p>Buffy stared at her for a few moments.</p>
<p>"Do you want me to stay here overnight?"</p>
<p>Faith looked at her pleadingly.</p>
<p>"Would you?" she asked in a small voice.</p>
<p>"If you want."</p>
<p>Faith hesitated for a moment and then nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes. Please."</p>
<p>Buffy was surprised by Faith's pleading tone, not being used to it, but she didn't comment.</p>
<p>"Okay," she said.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Faith said quietly and looked away again, not used to asking for help or thanking for it.</p>
<p>"I've talked to the guys," Buffy said and Faith looked at her anxiously.</p>
<p>"Wh-What did they say?"</p>
<p>"Well, Willow and Xander had the most to say. They don't trust you and they're afraid of you."</p>
<p>"Oh," Faith said and looked away.</p>
<p>Buffy hesitated for a moment and then touched Faith's hand, causing Faith to look at her.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, once they see that you've... well, that you are not a psycho, they'll start feeling more comfortable around you."</p>
<p>Faith stared at Buffy for a few moments, thinking.</p>
<p>"Why are you helping me?" she then asked.</p>
<p> Buffy sighed.</p>
<p>"I don't know. I guess I feel responsible for what happened to you. I mean, I was also there when you killed Finch, but we blamed you like you were the only one responsible for his death. And I guess we could've included you more in our lives, you must've felt like an outsider," she said and Faith nodded absentmindedly. "It's gonna be hard for you for a while, but I promise I'll be there for you, Faith. And if you wanna talk to me, don't be afraid to say so, okay?"</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"So, em, you wanna talk about something else? I mean, I can bring you up to date on what's been going on since I... stabbed you."</p>
<p>Faith thought for a moment and then nodded.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Buffy hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, you know. I know I was pissed, but I had no right to stab you."</p>
<p>"I understand," Faith said and Buffy smiled a little. She gulped. "But I wanted you to."</p>
<p>"What?" Buffy asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>"I w-wanted to you e-end it for m-me," Faith explained.</p>
<p>"Oh," Buffy said, surprised. She took a deep breath. "So, em, can I sit beside you?"</p>
<p>Faith hesitated for a moment and then moved a bit so Buffy could sit beside her.</p>
<p>"Thanks. Okay now, let's see..."</p>

<hr/>

<p>When Faith fell asleep, Buffy covered her with a blanket. She observed at her for a while, thinking she looked so innocent. Then she considered going to her room, but she decided to stay, in case Faith had a nightmare.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In the middle of the night, Buffy was awoken by sounds and movement. She listened for a moment, ready to fight, but then she realized it was Faith whimpering. She turned on the light and faced her. She saw that Faith was crying in sleep and that she was obviously scared. She gently shook her.</p>
<p>"Faith."</p>
<p>Faith opened her eyes with a yelp.</p>
<p>"It's okay," Buffy said and Faith looked at her, wide-eyed.</p>
<p>Faith looked away and quickly wiped her eyes, embarrassed.</p>
<p>"It's okay to cry, Faith," Buffy said, touching Faith's shoulder again.</p>
<p>Faith sobbed for a few moments and then calmed down.</p>
<p>They lay quietly for a while, Buffy making sure Faith drifted off to sleep first.</p>

<hr/>

<p>During the next few days, Faith stayed at home and the Scoobs avoided the house like it contained a plague. Joyce offered to stay as well, to keep her company, but Faith told her it was okay for her to go to work. But those hours that she was alone proved to be a hard trial for Faith, who had nothing to distract herself with but TV, radio and newspapers. She read the newspapers, listened to radio and watched TV, but it only took a little thing to bring back the bad memories. Sometimes it took her only a few minutes to break out of her reverie, but sometimes, it took her an hour or more. And each time it was over, she wanted to scream and beat something or someone up to relieve the pain. But she held herself in check.</p>
<p>For a day. Then she decided that the only thing she could hurt was herself. She got a knife and went to the bathroom. She took off her shirt and slowly started to cut gashes across her upper arm, one day on the left arm, the next on the right one. After only took three or four gashes, relief washed over her and the tears came. She let them flow for a while. Then she cleaned up the knife, her arms, which were already healing, and the floor. She dressed up, took the knife back into the kitchen, and watched some TV again.</p>
<p>Buffy volunteered to stay with Faith each night and Faith accepted, relieved to know that when the nightmare came, someone would be there to wake her up and comfort her. She was a bit uncomfortable at first because that someone was Buffy, but she quickly got used to it. In the morning, she was embarrassed at first, but she quickly relaxed when Buffy didn't make a big deal out of it.</p>
<p>Then, one night, Faith had a particularly bad nightmare and she was tossing and turning and screaming. It took Buffy a few moments to wake her up.</p>
<p>"No!" Faith screamed as she instinctively pushed Buffy away.</p>
<p>Buffy caught herself before she fell off the bed.</p>
<p>"Faith, it's me, it's okay."</p>
<p>Faith's teary eyes finally focused and she looked at her, puzzled.</p>
<p>"You had a nightmare," Buffy explained. "Do you remember anything?"</p>
<p>Faith sat up, pulling her knees to her body, hugging them. She thought for a few moments and then nodded.</p>
<p>"Th-They b-brain-w-washed m-me, I-I think." She frowned as she tried to remember. "...the b-best... o-obey... kill... B-Buffy... No! H-Have to k-kill... No! D-Don't w-wanna... "Kill... kill... kill... Obey... No!"</p>
<p>Faith started to tremble again, like she was talking to someone who wasn't there. Buffy quickly hugged her.</p>
<p>"It's okay, Faith, it's okay," she said, caressing her.</p>
<p>"I-I'm scared," Faith whimpered, crying, and hugged her back.</p>
<p>"Me to," Buffy whispered.</p>
<p>"Don't wanna kill. You."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>"I-I'm l-losing it."</p>
<p>"Shhh," Buffy tried to comfort her, tears running down her cheeks.</p>
<p>Faith slowly drifted off to sleep, hugging Buffy tightly, afraid to wake up alone. Buffy quietly held her, wondering if the Council had brainwashed Faith.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Buffy was the first to wake up in the morning. She was a bit puzzled to find herself hugging Faith and vice versa, but then she remembered the previous night and she relaxed. She caressed Faith, wondering what to do to help her, and Faith snuggled even closer, as if she was instinctively feeling that she was safe in Buffy's arms.</p>
<p>When Faith finally woke up, she was startled at first to find herself in Buffy's arms, and she pulled back.</p>
<p>"I-I'm s-sorry," she said, worried that she had somehow insulted Buffy.</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"It's okay."</p>
<p>Faith glanced at the clock.</p>
<p>"D-Don't you have s-school today?"</p>
<p>"Not for another hour."</p>
<p>Faith frowned.</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>Buffy hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>"Do you remember anything from last night?"</p>
<p>Faith seemed to shrink as she shook her head.</p>
<p>"N-No, o-only... feelings."</p>
<p>"Oh." Buffy thought for a moment. "I'll ask Giles if he could hypnotize you. If you want."</p>
<p>Faith thought for a moment.</p>
<p>"I-I don't kn-know," she said uncertainly. "I-I'm scared," she added, whispering.</p>
<p>"I'll be there with you, if you want."</p>
<p>Faith gulped and then took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"O-Okay," she said and Buffy smiled at her.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll ask Giles," Buffy said and Faith nodded. Buffy got up. "Feeling better?" she asked.</p>
<p>Faith smiled for a brief moment.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Th-Thanks."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"No problem," she said and left.</p>
<p>Faith lay back and stared at the ceiling. She had lied to Buffy, she did remember one thing. <i>Kill Buffy.</i> She shuddered, fighting the voice in her head. She would not kill Buffy. Or anyone else. Except maybe herself, if that was what it would take not to kill someone else.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In the evening, Faith heard the scream and she ran to the door. She saw Joyce fighting a vamp and she ran out to protect her. She pushed the vamp away and then started to beat him instead of staking him. She knew what the vamp was and she wanted to take out her frustration on him.</p>
<p>Joyce stared at Faith for a few moments as Faith beat up the vamp, and then decided to intervene.</p>
<p>"Faith," she said, but Faith didn't respond. She went closer. "Faith," she called again, but Faith continued to ignore her. "Faith," she said and put her hand on Faith's shoulder.</p>
<p>Faith reacted by hitting her. Joyce stumbled away, realizing that touching Faith while she was out of her mind was not the smartest thing to do. Faith then she realized what she has done and she stared at Joyce, shocked.</p>
<p>"I-I'm s-sorry, I-I d-didn't m-mean it," Faith stuttered as a few tears rolled down her cheek.</p>
<p>"I know," Joyce said. Then her eyes went wide as she noticed another vampire running at Faith at full speed. "Faith..."</p>
<p>Faith saw the warning in Joyce's eyes just a little too late. She started to turn, but the vamp was upon her and he knocked her out. Joyce gasped as the vamp buried his fangs into Faith's neck and started to drink. She hesitated for a moment and then ran toward him and kicked him in the head. The vamp fell off Faith and touched his head, dizzy. Then he recovered and looked at Joyce. Joyce gulped and looked around for a stake. Unfortunately, Faith didn't bring a stake with her.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Buffy was returning from Giles' place when she saw the commotion in front of her house. She started running and her heart started to beat faster when she saw her mother fighting a vamp. Then she got closer and she saw that Faith and another vamp were lying on the ground, unconscious. She ran as fast as she could, her stake ready.</p>
<p>"Buffy!" Joyce called, having noticed her.</p>
<p>The vamp turned and prepared to defend himself, but Buffy plowed through his defenses and staked him.</p>
<p>"Mom?" Buffy asked and looked at Faith.</p>
<p>"I'm fine, honey," Joyce said and Buffy moved to Faith. "He hit her on the head and started drinking," Joyce explained.</p>
<p>Buffy kneeled beside Faith, stabbed the unconscious vamp and put the stake away. She checked Faith's heartbeat and then gently examined Faith's wound. She was relieved that it wasn't too torn. She picked her up and carried her up to the bathroom.</p>
<p>There, she took care of the bite wound, which was already healing. Then she removed the torn and bloody shirt and her eyes went wide when she noticed the scars on Faith's arms, which had obviously been reopened many times. She stared at them, puzzled at first, but then she realized that Faith must have cut herself. She stared at Faith, shocked and confused.</p>
<p>She finally took a deep breath and threw the torn shirt to the bin. She was about to pick up Faith, when Faith woke up.</p>
<p>"Faith?"</p>
<p>Faith looked around, puzzled.</p>
<p>"What..." She trailed off when she realized that she wasn't wearing a shirt and that Buffy could see the cuts on her upper arms. She immediately covered them, even though it was too late. "H-How's your mom?"</p>
<p>"She's fine," Buffy said. "Why did you cut yourself?"</p>
<p>Faith seemed to shrink and she looked away, embarrassed. Buffy gently touched her and Faith looked at her for a moment.</p>
<p>"S-So I w-wouldn't h-hurt som-meone else," she said quietly and hugged her knees.</p>
<p>"Oh Faith," Buffy said and wanted to hug her, but Faith quickly got up and ran to her room.</p>
<p>Buffy sighed and got up.</p>
<p>"Honey?" Joyce asked when she came out of the bathroom.</p>
<p>Buffy looked at her.</p>
<p>"She cut herself."</p>
<p>Joyce frowned.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" she asked and came closer.</p>
<p>"She cut her upper arms."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>Buffy sighed.</p>
<p>"She said that because she didn't want to hurt someone else."</p>
<p>"So she hurt herself instead."</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes. I'm worried, Mom."</p>
<p>"Did you talk to Mr Giles?"</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I was gonna take Faith there now, but she's too upset and scared. I'll tell him we'll come tomorrow, or whenever Faith's ready."</p>
<p>Joyce nodded and hugged her. Buffy hugged her back and they stood like that for a few moments.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In her room, Faith was sitting on her bed, hugging her knees, shaking. She was crying, terrified. She was losing it and she knew it. It was only a matter of time before she lost it completely, and when she did, cutting herself would no longer be enough. She considered killing herself, but there was still hope there that Buffy would somehow help her.</p>
<p>When she heard Buffy going downstairs with Joyce, Faith made her decision. She quickly put on another shirt and went to the door. She listened for a few moments and when she heard that Buffy was on the phone, she opened the window, climbed down and disappeared into the night.</p>

<hr/>

<p>When Buffy came up a few minutes later, she went to Faith's room and gently knocked. There was no response, so she slowly opened the door.</p>
<p>"Faith?" she said before she peeked in.</p>
<p>She frowned when she didn't see her. But then she noticed that the window was open and she got a bad feeling.</p>
<p>"Faith?" she said and ran to the window.</p>
<p>She looked out, but Faith was nowhere to be seen. She ran out of the room.</p>
<p>"Faith!" she called and went from room to room, but Faith was not there.</p>
<p>She ran downstairs.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, honey?" Joyce asked, concerned.</p>
<p>"Faith, she's gone."</p>
<p>"What? Why?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. I'm gonna go look for her."</p>
<p>"Okay, honey. Be careful."</p>
<p>"I will," Buffy said and ran out.</p>

<hr/>

<p>"Anything?" Giles asked when Buffy came to him the next evening.</p>
<p>Buffy sighed, shaking her head.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Buffy."</p>
<p>Buffy jerked, startled, and looked at Riley.</p>
<p>"Hi," she said, smiling a little.</p>
<p>Riley came closer.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah," she said and him. "But I'm worried about Faith."</p>
<p>"Em, you said she started to remember?" Giles said.</p>
<p>Buffy let go of Riley and looked at Giles.</p>
<p>"Yes. Someone was telling her to obey and to kill me."</p>
<p>"Kill you?" Giles said, alarmed.</p>
<p>"Yes. She didn't remember in the morning."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"Are you sure she isn't just crazy?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>Buffy glared at him.</p>
<p>"No. Someone did something to her, brainwashed her, I think." She looked at Giles. "And for some reason she's remembering. Partly, anyway." She sighed. "I'm gonna go look for her."</p>
<p>"Do you want me to come along?" Riley asked.</p>
<p>Buffy thought for a moment.</p>
<p>"No, I think it would be better if we split. That way we could search a wider area."</p>
<p>"I don't know what she looks like," Riley pointed out.</p>
<p>Buffy frowned.</p>
<p>"Oh." She sighed. "Okay then." She looked at Willow and Xander. "Are you guys coming?"</p>
<p>Willow and Xander looked at one another.</p>
<p>"Em, we're not as sure about her as you are," Willow then said.</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Okay," she said. "I'll see you later."</p>
<p>She and Riley left and Willow and Xander looked at one another, feeling bad for letting Buffy down.</p>

<hr/>

<p>As Buffy and Riley walked around Sunnydale searching for Faith, Riley observed Buffy.</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" he finally asked.</p>
<p>Buffy looked at him, startled.</p>
<p>"What? Oh. Yeah." She sighed and started to look around again. "I'm just worried about Faith. She... She's so... fragile, you know?"</p>
<p>"I thought she was your enemy."</p>
<p>Buffy glanced at him.</p>
<p>"So did I. But she's not. I think it was just her conditioning breaking through."</p>
<p>"Conditioning?" Riley asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>"I think she's been brainwashed."</p>
<p>"By whom?"</p>
<p>"The Council."</p>
<p>Riley frowned.</p>
<p>"Why would the Council brainwash her?"</p>
<p>Buffy sighed.</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>

<hr/>

<p>At the mansion, Faith was raving. Again. She had chained herself to the wall and was now trying to escape her prison. But the chains held. Her clothes were bloody and she was sitting in a pool of her own blood, which had come from numerous cuts all over her body. Near by was a piece of glass which she had used to cut herself. She took the piece of glass and ran it across her face, leaving a nasty gash in its wake. When she ran out of face, she ran the glass down her neck, past her breasts and stopped when she reached her legs. The mental pain momentarily gone, she pulled her legs to her chest and cried for a while.</p>
<p>When she calmed down a bit, she realized she was still holding the piece of glass. She looked at it and saw the blood on her hands. She dropped the piece of glass and the bad memories came back again. She zoned out for a while, lost in the world of her confusing memories, and then started to rave all over again, until she was exhausted and Morpheus took her into the land of nightmares.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Spike was returning to his crypt from the shopping trip to the city dump when he noticed suspicious movement. Thinking it was the Initiative soldiers, he quickly hid. It didn't take long before three men came by. Spike was about to move on when he heard that the men were talking with British accent. He quickly realized that they were from the Watchers' Council. He waited until they were gone and then went to find Buffy. After, of course, he dropped his stuff off at the crypt, since there were a few items that he didn't want Buffy to see.</p>

<hr/>

<p>"Isn't it a little too late for a date?" Spike asked when he approached Buffy and Riley, who were still searching for Faith.</p>
<p>Buffy glared at him.</p>
<p>"What do you want, Spike?"</p>
<p>"Nothing."</p>
<p>"Then why are you here?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I just came across an interesting piece of news."</p>
<p>"And that is?"</p>
<p>"The Watchers are in town."</p>
<p>Buffy frowned.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>Spike rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>"What I said. There's three of them and they're looking for something. Or someone."</p>
<p>Buffy's eyes went wide.</p>
<p>"Faith."</p>
<p>"The Slayer?" Spike asked.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Isn't she in the hospital where you put her?"</p>
<p>Buffy glared at him again.</p>
<p>"No. Right now, we don't know where she is."</p>
<p>"And they want her?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"What do you think?"</p>
<p>"They want to off her because she's crazy?"</p>
<p>Buffy grabbed Spike by the throat.</p>
<p>"She's not crazy," she said and pushed him away. "They brainwashed her."</p>
<p>Spike laughed and Buffy promptly hit him in the face.</p>
<p>"Au!" Spike screamed and covered his nose. "Why'd you do that for?"</p>
<p>"Because what I said wasn't funny."</p>
<p>"Oh, sure, go ahead, kill the messenger because he's having fun," Spike murmured and left, angry.</p>
<p>Buffy looked at Riley.</p>
<p>"We have to find her before they do," she said and Riley nodded.</p>

<hr/>

<p>On his way back to his crypt, Spike passed the mansion. Suddenly his nostrils flared as he smelled blood. He sniffed the air and followed the scent to the mansion. He opened the door and took a deep breath to inhale the powerful scent of blood. He went deeper into the mansion and finally noticed Faith.</p>
<p>"Well, well, what have we here," he said and approached her. "Mmm, blood," he said when he noticed the pool of blood. He looked around. "Is this a self-service buffet?" he asked. There was no answer, so he approached Faith and kneeled beside her. "God, what a mess you are. Too bad I couldn't do that myself," he said and Faith jerked awake. He dipped a finger into the blood and licked it. "Mmm, delish." He frowned. "Wait a minute," he said and dipped tasted the blood again. "You're a Slayer!" he said, surprised.</p>
<p>Faith finally realized that he was a vamp and she kicked him in the face</p>
<p>"Au!" Spike said as he staggered back, clutching his nose. "Not again."</p>
<p>Faith launched herself at him, growling, and he backed off, but the chains stopped Faith.</p>
<p>"You're Faith, right, the crazy Slayer."</p>
<p>"Kill... kill... kill... I'm gonna kill you... kill you..." Faith ranted as she tried to break free of the chains.</p>
<p>"You are crazy," Spike said. "No wonder the Watchers are looking for you"</p>
<p>"Kill Watchers!" Faith screamed and threw herself at him again.</p>
<p>Spike smirked.</p>
<p>"Hmm, who to tell, Buffy or the Watchers. Decisions, decisions."</p>
<p>Faith froze when he mentioned Buffy's name and she seemed to shrink.</p>
<p>"Don't tell Buffy... Don't tell Buffy..." she said in a small voice. Then she launched at him again. "Kill you... Kill Buffy... Kill Watchers..."</p>
<p>"Lost all your marbles, have you?" Spike said, shaking his head.</p>
<p>He stared at her for a few more moments as she raved, and then left.</p>

<hr/>

<p>It took Spike a while to locate Buffy, but he finally did.</p>
<p>"What do you want now?" Buffy asked, annoyed.</p>
<p>"Hey, I'm just the messenger," Spike said and tried to stay at a safe distance.</p>
<p>"And what's the message now?"</p>
<p>"I found Faith."</p>
<p>Buffy stared at her for a few moments.</p>
<p>"You don't even know what she looks like."</p>
<p>"Well, Xander did describe her pretty well, plus the taste of her blood is unmistakable."</p>
<p>Buffy was on him in a moment. She knocked him down and straddled him.</p>
<p>"What did you do to her?" she demanded.</p>
<p>"Nothing! I mean, it was a sight to behold, but I had nothing to do with it, I swear."</p>
<p>"With what?" Buffy asked, worried.</p>
<p>"She's at the mansion looking like a steak someone didn't know how to carve properly."</p>
<p>Buffy let go of Spike and ran to the mansion. Riley followed her. Spike slowly got up and rubbed his neck.</p>
<p>"Damn Slayers, nothing but trouble," he grumbled and slowly followed them.</p>

<hr/>

<p>When she got to the mansion, Buffy stopped for a moment, nervous. The smell of blood didn't help her any. She took a deep breath and entered. The smell of blood became stronger inside, but the air was still breathable.</p>
<p>"Faith!" she called, waiting for her eyes to adjust to the darkness.</p>
<p>"Buffy?" came the weak reply.</p>
<p>Buffy started walking and soon noticed Faith. Her eyes went wide from shock and she nearly choked when she saw the condition Faith was in.</p>
<p>"God, Faith," she whispered and tears started to run down her cheeks.</p>
<p>"Buffy!" Riley called as he approached the mansion, but Buffy ignored him.</p>
<p>She approached Faith and the closer she got, the more shocked she became</p>
<p>Suddenly Faith jumped at her.</p>
<p>"Kill Buffy... kill Buffy... kill... kill..." she ranted as she tried to free the chains.</p>
<p>"Faith."</p>
<p>Faith suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>"Buffy?" she said, tears streaming down her cheeks. She sat down and pulled her legs up to her chest. "No... no... no..." she started repeating, fighting an inaudible order.</p>
<p>Buffy stepped closer.</p>
<p>"Faith..."</p>
<p>"Kill Buffy!" Faith screamed and jumped at Buffy with such ferocity that dislocated both her shoulders. She screamed in pain, but she kept trying to break free. "Kill Buffy... kill Buffy... kill... No!" she suddenly screamed and threw herself against the wall, causing more waves of pain to wash over her.</p>
<p>"Buffy?" Riley said softly when he reached her, but Buffy ignored him.</p>
<p>She stared at Faith, crying. She wanted to help her, but she didn't know how. She stepped closer and Faith suddenly attacked her again.</p>
<p>"Kill... kill... kill... kill..." she ranted.</p>
<p>Buffy then made a decision.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Faith," she said and knocked Faith out.</p>
<p>Faith collapsed, but Buffy caught her. She leaned her against the wall and straddled her legs, ignoring the fact that her clothes would be ruined. She observed her for a while and then caressed her.</p>
<p>As Riley observed her, he had the sinking feeling that Faith meant more to Buffy than he did.</p>
<p>Buffy then cleaned up Faith's face a bit. She took a deep breath and thought for a moment. She glanced at Riley.</p>
<p>"Hold her, Riley."</p>
<p>Riley stepped closer.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>
<p>"I need to set her shoulders."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>Buffy got up and Riley kneeled beside Faith and hugged her. Buffy took Faith's hand and pulled. Then she and Riley switched sides and Buffy set the other arm.</p>
<p>"See if there's a key around."</p>
<p>Riley got up and started to look around, and Buffy quickly examined Faith's wounds.</p>
<p>"I found it," Riley soon declared and returned with a key.</p>
<p>Buffy took it and unchained Faith.</p>
<p>"What a sight, isn't it?" Spike said as he casually walked in. "Makes my heart all bleeding for the past."</p>
<p>Buffy glared at him.</p>
<p>"Right now I would be very careful what I say, if I were you, especially if I had my continued existence to worry about."</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, relax," Spike said, slightly nervous.</p>
<p>Buffy picked up Faith and looked at Riley.</p>
<p>"Go to Giles and tell him we've found Faith. I'm taking her home."</p>
<p>"Are you sure?" Riley said. "I mean, I saw she was completely... insane."</p>
<p>"I'm sure."</p>
<p>"What about the Council?"</p>
<p>"I'll take Spike with me."</p>
<p>"Spike?"</p>
<p>"Me?" Spike said, surprised.</p>
<p>"Yes," Buffy said. "He can take any bullets and then I can take them out"</p>
<p>"Hey, I'm no bullet pincushion," Spike protested.</p>
<p>Buffy gave him a blank look.</p>
<p>"Wanna bet?"</p>
<p>Spike gulped.</p>
<p>"That's not fair, you know, threatening someone who can't fight back."</p>
<p>"What makes you think I care?"</p>
<p>"Bloody Slayers," Spike mumbled as Buffy walked past him.</p>

<hr/>

<p>"Trouble ahead," Spike said as they approached Buffy's house.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"The Council. See those three?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"That's them. And they've just spotted us."</p>
<p>The Council hit men started to run toward them.</p>
<p>"Here," Buffy said to Spike and turned to give him Faith.</p>
<p>"Whoa," Spike said and backed off. "I'm not taking her."</p>
<p>"Yes, you are. Unless you want me to stake you right away."</p>
<p>"On the other hand," Spike said and took Faith.</p>
<p>"Run around the block and I'll take them out."</p>
<p>"Can't I watch?"</p>
<p>"Run!"</p>
<p>"Okay, okay," Spike said and started to run.</p>
<p>Buffy followed them, but as soon as they were out of the hit men's sight, she hid and waited.</p>
<p>It didn't take long for the hit men to catch up. Buffy jumped them from behind, pushing one, kicking another in the knees and knocking the third one, who had already started to turn, out. She knocked the second one out with a roundhouse kick to the head and then grabbed the third one by the neck, squeezing so hard that she brought him to his knees.</p>
<p>"Okay, buddy, listen very carefully. You touch Faith, you die. Got it?"</p>
<p>The man nodded.</p>
<p>"And if I find out that what's happened to her was your fault... Well, you'll wish it wasn't. I suggest you pack up and leave, because if I see you again, you won't be so lucky as you are right now."</p>
<p>She let go of the man and then knocked him out. She stared at them for a few moments, disgusted, and then ran home.</p>
<p>She reached the door before Spike did, so she ran toward him to take Faith from him.</p>
<p>"You're welcome," Spike said as Buffy left without so much as a thank you.</p>
<p>He slowly followed her, but when she disappeared into the house, he knew that was it.</p>

<hr/>

<p>"Mom!" Buffy called as she kicked the door shut behind her. "Mom!"</p>
<p>"Yes, honey?" Joyce said as she came from the living room.</p>
<p>"I have Faith!"</p>
<p>Joyce's eyes went wide when she saw the condition Faith was in.</p>
<p>"My god, what happened?" she asked, shocked.</p>
<p>"She did this to herself," Buffy said and headed for the stairs.</p>
<p>"Really?" Joyce said, surprised.</p>
<p>"Yes. Can you help me take care of her wounds, please?"</p>
<p>"Yes, of course," Joyce said and followed Buffy upstairs.</p>

<hr/>

<p>As they cleaned Faith, they saw that the cuts were all over her body. Some were deep, some were not. Some were short and some were long. And some had been reopened several times. Buffy cried as they washed the blood off and bandaged Faith.</p>
<p>When they were done, Buffy picked Faith up and took her to her room. Then she changed her clothes and dressed Faith. She heard that her mother was on the phone, but she didn't want to talk to anyone. She lay beside Faith, put her hand across Faith's stomach and observed her.</p>

<hr/>

<p>An hour later, Faith awoke with a scream.</p>
<p>"Shh, it's okay," Buffy said.</p>
<p>Faith looked at her.</p>
<p>"Kill... No... No, I don't wanna," she said and backed off.</p>
<p>"Faith, it's okay," Buffy said and went after her.</p>
<p>"No, please," Faith said.</p>
<p>"Do you still want to be hypnotized?"</p>
<p>"W-Will it help?"</p>
<p>"Giles thinks so."</p>
<p>Faith took a deep breath and then nodded.</p>
<p>"Okay." Buffy thought for a moment. "We better do it at the mansion. We can chain you there, in case you start getting violent during the hypnosis."</p>
<p>Faith nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>"Come on then."</p>

<hr/>

<p>When they got to the mansion, Buffy chained Faith with a different set of chains, she didn't want her to get the blood on her new clothes. Then they waited. Faith closed her eyes and rested.</p>
<p>Giles and the Scoobs arrived a few minutes later and Faith stared at them nervously.</p>
<p>"Buffy," Giles said.</p>
<p>"Hi. Did Mom tell you?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Okay, do it, before she loses it again."</p>
<p>Giles nodded and stepped closer while the Scoobs stopped a few steps away and stared at the bandages covering Faith's face and hands. Faith gripped Buffy's hand, scared, while Giles tried to hypnotize her.</p>
<p>"She is hypnotized," Giles finally said. "What do I ask her?"</p>
<p>"Well, I think she's been brainwashed and somebody ordered her to kill me."</p>
<p>Giles thought for a moment and then looked at Faith.</p>
<p>"Faith, can you hear me?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Faith said.</p>
<p>"Do you remember when you became a Slayer?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Good. No go forward in time to the time when something strange happened, when someone told you to kill Buffy."</p>
<p>Faith tensed.</p>
<p>"Are you there?" Giles asked.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Describe the place."</p>
<p>Faith moved her head a bit like she was looking around.</p>
<p>"It's a picnic place. We're having a picnic."</p>
<p>"Who's we?"</p>
<p>"Me and my Watcher. She's talking to me."</p>
<p>"How did you get to the picnic place."</p>
<p>Faith frowned as she tried to remember.</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"What's the last thing you remember before the picnic place?"</p>
<p>Faith tensed again.</p>
<p>"I'm fighting a vamp. No, two. I dust the first and then the second. Ouch."</p>
<p>"What happened?"</p>
<p>"Something hit me in the butt."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>Faith frowned.</p>
<p>"An arrow of some kind. It's small. I think I'm passing out."</p>
<p>"And now you're waking up again. What's going on?"</p>
<p>Faith struggled a bit.</p>
<p>"I can't move. Somebody tied me up."</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, I can't see. The light's too bright. There are voices."</p>
<p>"What are they saying?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, they're whispering. Someone's coming. It's a man. He's holding something."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, I can't see well, my eyes are all fuzzy. No, wait, it's a crystal of some sort. Blue. I think he's trying to hypnotize... Hey, how did I get here?"</p>
<p>"Where are you?"</p>
<p>"A picnic place. With my Watcher."</p>
<p>"Faith, that place is not real and your Watcher is not there."</p>
<p>Faith frowned.</p>
<p>"Then where am I?"</p>
<p>"You've been hypnotized."</p>
<p>"Oh. Oh, what's going on?" Faith asked, worried.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Everything's fading. The picnic place, my Watcher, they're disappearing"</p>
<p>"That's okay, they weren't there in the first place."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"Do you hear anything?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that man. I think he's British."</p>
<p>"What is he saying?"</p>
<p>Faith listened for a moment.</p>
<p>"He says I'm the best, invincible. Alright! At least someone believes in me beside my Watcher. Hey, what do you mean obey? You're not..." Faith screamed as imaginary pain shot through her. "Fuck off! What are..." She screamed again. "Okay, okay, cut the crap! I'll listen, alright?"</p>
<p>"Faith, what did he say?"</p>
<p>"He says I have to obey him. He's reading some funny nursery rhyme, I think. Moron. What? I ain't killing no one, you crazy..." Faith screamed again. "Fuck you! I'm not! I'm..."</p>
<p>She shook again, obviously in pain.</p>
<p>"Listen to me, Faith," Giles said, "the pain is not real, ignore it."</p>
<p>"What do you mean it's not real? He's fucking electrocuting me."</p>
<p>"He's not, ignore it."</p>
<p>Faith hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>"Okay. But I ain't killing anyone."</p>
<p>"Who does he want you to kill?"</p>
<p>"Buffy."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. He says I have to kill her if they tell me to. I don't want to, I'm not a murderer." She shuddered. "He's hurting me again."</p>
<p>"Ignore it."</p>
<p>"Now he's telling me to forget what he told me. What a moron. Why did he tell me in the first place, if he now wants me to forget?"</p>
<p>"What do you remember next?"</p>
<p>"They're moving me. We're driving somewhere."</p>
<p>"You have arrived."</p>
<p>"Au! Watch it, you moron."</p>
<p>"What happened?"</p>
<p>"They dumped me somewhere." She listened for a moment. "That guy's telling me I'm gonna wake up in five minutes and not remember anything."</p>
<p>"They five minutes have passed. Where are you?"</p>
<p>Faith looked around.</p>
<p>"Where I fought the vamps. How did I get here?"</p>
<p>Giles looked at Buffy.</p>
<p>"What next?"</p>
<p>"Can you undo the conditioning?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Okay. But first, I need to know why she went... crazy." She looked at Faith. "Faith, go forward in time," she said, "to the moment when Kakistos killed your Watcher."</p>
<p>Faith tensed and then startled to tremble.</p>
<p>"No," she whispered and tears started to run down her cheeks.</p>
<p>"How do you feel?"</p>
<p>"I'm a loser, I'm not the best, I can't even protect my own Watcher." She shuddered. "I'm scared."</p>
<p>"And now you're in Sunnydale and you've met me. I mean, Buffy."</p>
<p>"Wow, she's pretty."</p>
<p>Buffy blushed, surprised.</p>
<p>"And now you've just killed Kakistos."</p>
<p>"Got you, you sick bastard."</p>
<p>"How do you feel?"</p>
<p>Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"Tired. I don't know what I'd do if it weren't for Buffy."</p>
<p>"Mrs Post came to town and she's your new Watcher."</p>
<p>"She seems like a bitch. To others, anyway. She seems to like me. I mean, nobody tells me anything."</p>
<p>"And now you find her fighting Angel."</p>
<p>Faith tensed.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna kill that bastard. I'm not gonna lose another Watcher."</p>
<p>"Buffy's arrived."</p>
<p>"Damn it, why can't we be on the same side? Why is she protecting him?"</p>
<p>She jerked.</p>
<p>"What is it?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"I have this urge to kill Buffy. I'm not gonna, I love her."</p>
<p>Everyone stared at Faith, shocked. Buffy took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"Okay, you just found out that Mrs Post used you. How do you feel?"</p>
<p>"Stupid. Screw Watchers, I'm not trusting anyone anymore."</p>
<p>"You and Buffy are walking down the alley and Buffy discovers Finch."</p>
<p>"I have this urge to kill him." She tensed. "God, what have I done? I didn't want to, it was an accident. It was an accident. Why is she looking at me like that?"</p>
<p>"Buffy?"</p>
<p>"She's looking at me like it's my fault. It was an accident. She's panicking, she wants to go to the police. Screw the police, I'm not going to jail, they're not getting me."</p>
<p>Buffy realized that there were tears running down her cheeks and she wiped them.</p>
<p>"Buffy came to see you and now she's leaving."</p>
<p>"I don't want her to leave."</p>
<p>"You want her to stay?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Why don't you tell her?"</p>
<p>"I'm scared. I don't wanna be scared."</p>
<p>"Why did you tell Giles Buffy killed Finch?"</p>
<p>"Because they won't blame her. If they find out it's me, they're gonna turn me in or something."</p>
<p>"But they found out anyway."</p>
<p>"Yeah. I think they'd blame me even if it was Buffy's fault."</p>
<p>"Xander came to you."</p>
<p>Faith snorted.</p>
<p>"He thinks he's important to me just because we had sex." She tensed. "I have this urge to kill him. I'm invincible. Au, my head."</p>
<p>"And now you're at the mansion, with Angel."</p>
<p>"I can't believe it! How could she do this to me?" She listened for a moment. "At least Angel's not trying to bullshit me. Alright, the cavalry!" She frowned. "Wait, what are you doing! Hey, you were supposed to rescue me. No, I'm not going to Britain! No! It wasn't my fault!"</p>
<p>"Now you're at the docks and you killed Trick."</p>
<p>"Bastard wanted to kill Buffy."</p>
<p>"But you went to the Mayor. Why?"</p>
<p>"He can protect me."</p>
<p>"But he was evil."</p>
<p>"So am I."</p>
<p>"No you're not."</p>
<p>"I killed a man."</p>
<p>Buffy sighed.</p>
<p>"And why did you kill Professor Wirth?"</p>
<p>"The Boss said so."</p>
<p>"You could've said no."</p>
<p>Faith shook her head.</p>
<p>"I have to obey."</p>
<p>Buffy sighed again.</p>
<p>"And why did you poison Angel?"</p>
<p>Faith hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>"Boss wanted me to distract Buffy."</p>
<p>Buffy thought for a few moments.</p>
<p>"Now you're waking up from coma. How do you feel?"</p>
<p>Faith tensed.</p>
<p>"I'm scared. They hurt me. Where am I? Oh no, I killed a man. No, I killed two men, I'm a monster. What's gonna happen to me?" She pulled her legs even closer to her chest. "Help," she said in a small voice.</p>
<p>"Okay, Buffy found you in that apartment."</p>
<p>"No, stay away, I don't wanna hurt you." She sobbed. "Help me."</p>
<p>Buffy sighed and stated at Faith for a few moments. Then she looked at Giles.</p>
<p>"Undo her conditioning and wake her up."</p>
<p>Giles nodded.</p>
<p>"Faith, listen to me. I will count to three and then you will wake up and remember everything you've told me. One, two, three."</p>
<p>Faith's eyes snapped open and she looked around, puzzled. Then she saw the Scoobs and remembered when she was. She looked at Buffy, afraid.</p>
<p>"Buffy?"</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"It's okay. Do you remember?"</p>
<p>Faith thought for a moment and then her eyes went wide.</p>
<p>"Those bastards, they... they brainwashed me." She shuddered. "It hurt." She thought some more and remembered that she had confessed her love to Buffy. "I... I'm sorry, I..."</p>
<p>"About what?" Buffy asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>Faith sighed and glanced at the Scoobs.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you later."</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Let's go home then," she said and Faith nodded. Buffy got up and then helped Faith up. "Willow, can you hack into police computer and find out if they have any evidence against Faith?"</p>
<p>"Sure," Willow said, relieved that the nightmare was over and that Faith was on their side. She hesitated for a moment. "I'm sorry, Faith."</p>
<p>Faith frowned, surprised.</p>
<p>"I-It's okay."</p>
<p>"We'll see you tomorrow, guys," Buffy said.</p>
<p>"Thanks, G-Giles," Faith said nervously.</p>
<p>Giles nodded.</p>
<p>"You're welcome, Faith."</p>
<p>Buffy and Faith then left, hand in hand, and Riley had the distinct feeling that it was over between him and Buffy.</p>

<hr/>

<p>"Mom!" Buffy called when she and Faith came home.</p>
<p>Joyce quickly came from the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Buffy?"</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"Hi, Mom, we're back."</p>
<p>Joyce glanced at Faith.</p>
<p>"Is everything alright?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Giles hypnotized her."</p>
<p>"How do you feel?" Joyce asked Faith.</p>
<p>Faith hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Joyce smiled.</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>Then the police sirens were heard outside and Faith looked at Buffy, scared. Joyce went to the door and looked through.</p>
<p>"It's the police," she confirmed.</p>
<p>"I don't wanna go to jail," Faith said.</p>
<p>"You're not," Buffy said and thought. "I have a plan. Mom, if they ask for Faith, tell them she's upstairs in her room and that I've brought her home, well, before. Just tell them what you saw, but don't mention that she had already awakened."</p>
<p>Joyce nodded.</p>
<p>"Okay, honey."</p>
<p>"Come on, let's go upstairs," Buffy said and ran upstairs.</p>
<p>Faith followed her.</p>
<p>"Are you sure it's gonna work?" Faith asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I'm gonna tell them you were tortured by three British guys and then I'm gonna give them the description of the Council guys. And then you can tell them that when you wake up."</p>
<p>"Tell them?" Faith asked, worried.</p>
<p>"Yeah, you're gonna have to talk them, and the sooner you do the better," she said and Faith gulped. "Look, just lie still and pretend you're unconscious, okay?"</p>
<p>Faith nodded and lay on the bed. Buffy sat beside her and took her hand.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before the cops came upstairs, hands on their guns, followed by Joyce. But when they saw that Faith was obviously unconscious, coupled with the fact that she was bandaged, they relaxed a bit.</p>
<p>"What happened?" Detective Stein asked.</p>
<p>"She was tortured by some British guys."</p>
<p>"How do you know they were British?"</p>
<p>"I heard them talk." She glanced at Faith. "They held her at the mansion, there are still bloodstains around."</p>
<p>"Do you know why?"</p>
<p>"No." She pretended to think for a moment. "I think I've seen them around before."</p>
<p>"When?"</p>
<p>"Last year. We'll come to the station tomorrow and give you their descriptions. Look, she isn't going anywhere," she added when Stein hesitated. "You can post some officers around the house to make sure that those three don't come and try to kidnap her again."</p>
<p>Stein nodded.</p>
<p>"I will. And you make sure to bring her over first thing in the morning."</p>
<p>"If she's gonna wake up till then, she's lost a lot of blood."</p>
<p>Stein nodded.</p>
<p>"Very well," he said and left.</p>
<p>Buffy heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>"Okay, they're gone," she said when she heard the house door close.</p>
<p>Faith opened her eyes and looked at the room door. Then she looked at Buffy.</p>
<p>"Now what?"</p>
<p>"I'm gonna call Willow and see what she found out. Then we're gonna make up a story and go to the cops."</p>
<p>Faith hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>"Do you want me to confess?"</p>
<p>"No, you're not gonna pay for it, it was the Council's fault."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled and squeezed Faith's hand reassuringly.</p>
<p>"It's gonna be okay. Are you hungry?"</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"I'll tell Mom to bring you something."</p>
<p>"I can go downstairs."</p>
<p>"We don't want the cops to see you through the windows."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"Just relax and rest, okay?"</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>"You'll have to take a shower tomorrow, when your cuts heal," Buffy said and Faith nodded again. "I'll go tell Mom to make you something to eat and I'll call Willow. You gonna be okay?"</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah." She smiled a bit. "Thanks."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled back.</p>
<p>"You're welcome."</p>
<p>Buffy left and Faith stared after her until she was gone. Then she looked at the ceiling and thought. She realized that for the first time in a long time she was calm and not scared. Well, she was scared, but not as much as before, especially since she had Buffy on her side.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Downstairs, Buffy told Joyce to make some food for Faith and then she called Willow and Giles to let them know that the cops have come. Willow had not yet hacked into the police computer, but she promised to do so immediately. Since Joyce was busy preparing food for Faith, Buffy went to the bathroom and grabbed a quick shower.</p>
<p>When she came to the kitchen again, Joyce was making pancakes. Buffy took the soup that Joyce had already made and took it to Faith.</p>
<p>"Hey," she said with a smile as she walked in. "Mom's making pancakes, but here's some soup first."</p>
<p>Faith sat up and Buffy put the tray in front of her.</p>
<p>"Thanks," Faith said and started to eat.</p>
<p>Buffy sat on the bed and waited.</p>

<hr/>

<p>When Faith was done, Buffy took the tray downstairs and returned with the pancakes.</p>
<p>"I'll go eat my own pancakes now," she said.</p>
<p>Faith nodded and Buffy left again.</p>

<hr/>

<p>After Buffy ate her own pancakes, she went back upstairs and took Faith's tray downstairs. Then she returned to Faith. She wanted to lay beside Faith, but then she remembered that Faith was now okay.</p>
<p>"Em, do you want me to stay overnight? I mean, now that you're okay."</p>
<p>Faith thought for a moment.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Just in case. I mean, if that's okay with you, now that you know that I-I'm in... love with you," she finished quietly and looked away, nervous.</p>
<p>Buffy gasped, surprised, since she had already forgotten that Faith had mentioned that under hypnosis.</p>
<p>"You are?" she asked.</p>
<p>Faith glanced at her and nodded.</p>
<p>"Oh." She frowned. "You never said anything. Well, except the... Were the innuendoes your way of trying to determine how I felt about you?" she suddenly realized and Faith nodded. "God, I feel like an idiot." She sighed. "I'll stay with you, if you want me to."</p>
<p>Faith looked at her and nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"Okay," she said and climbed in.</p>

<hr/>

<p>When she woke up in the morning, Buffy found Faith cuddled up to her. She smiled at the sight. Faith had never been open with her emotions and somehow Buffy didn't think she would be a cuddly person. She was obviously wrong. She tucked a strand of Faith's hair behind her ear. She hesitated for a moment and then caressed her.</p>
<p>She frowned. Ever since Faith was back she had been realizing that she cared a great deal for her, especially after she found out that Faith was actually the victim, not some evil psychopath. She was glad that Faith was back, she had missed her, what they had together.</p>
<p>She found herself caressing Faith again and she quickly removed her hand, startled. She sighed and just lay still, waiting for Faith to wake up.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Faith woke up a few minutes later and she first cuddled even closer to Buffy, but then her eyes flew open as she realized what was going on, and she quickly backed off.</p>
<p>"I-I'm sorry," she said. "Didn't mean to..."</p>
<p>"It's okay," Buffy calmed her, smiling softly. "You didn't have a nightmare?"</p>
<p>Faith shook her head.</p>
<p>"No." She hesitated for a moment. "I had a bad dream, but it was nothing compared to the nightmare."</p>
<p>"I'm glad the nightmares are over."</p>
<p>Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"Me to."</p>
<p>"So, how about we get up then? We'll check your cuts and then you can take a shower and I'll call Willow."</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>They got up and went to the bathroom.</p>
<p>"Okay, em, undress," Buffy then said</p>
<p>Buffy was suddenly feeling a bit nervous, knowing she would see Faith naked. She had seen her naked before, but she had been too worried about Faith then to notice. Now, however...</p>
<p>Faith undressed and then Buffy carefully started to remove the bandages, first from the face, then the arms and the legs. Buffy then took a deep breath and looked at Faith.</p>
<p>"Em, I'm gonna have to take the rest off."</p>
<p>Faith gulped, suddenly self-conscious, and then nodded.</p>
<p>Buffy took another deep breath and then started to take the bandages off of Faith's body. Soon, Faith was standing in front of Buffy completely naked. Faith wanted to move her hands over her breasts and pussy, but she forced herself not to. Buffy gulped.</p>
<p>"This must've hurt," she said quietly, observing the numerous cuts.</p>
<p>Faith took a deep breath and looked at her body. She knew she was covered with cuts, but she had not expected a mess like that.</p>
<p>"I better bandage most of them," Buffy said, trying hard not to look at Faith's breasts or her pussy.</p>
<p>"Okay," Faith croaked.</p>
<p>"You better take a shower now and I'll call Willow," Buffy said and started to prepare the stuff Faith would need.</p>
<p>"Thanks," Faith said nervously when Buffy was done.</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"I'll see you later," she said and left.</p>
<p>Faith took a deep breath, looked around the bathroom and then stepped into the shower.</p>

<hr/>

<p>"Mom?" Buffy said when she came into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Joyce looked at her with a smile.</p>
<p>"Hi, honey. How's Faith?"</p>
<p>"She's okay, she didn't have a nightmare."</p>
<p>"That's good."</p>
<p>"Yeah. I checked her wounds. I'm gonna have to dress most of them again," Buffy said and Joyce nodded. "I'm gonna call Willow now. Can you make us something to eat?"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Mom," Buffy said and left to call Willow.</p>

<hr/>

<p>After calling Willow, Buffy went back to the bathroom, where Faith was just drying herself.</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry," Buffy said and quickly turned away.</p>
<p>Faith, who had stopped drying when Buffy had entered, continued to dry off.</p>
<p>"You were fast," Buffy said, facing away from Faith.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I didn't want to open the wounds again, so there's not much to wash."</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"I talked to Willow. She said they got nothing solid on you, just suspicions and indications. Seems like the Mayor cleaned up the evidence."</p>
<p>Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"So you simply have to deny everything. Okay?"</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>"Good. They'll ask you about the three men that kidnapped you, you tell them that you never got a good look at them, since they blindfolded you. Tell them that they worked for the Mayor, but that they always left before you could get a good look at them. Tell them that they kidnapped you because they wanted some file, but you don't know anything about it. Okay?"</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah." She sighed. "I'm done."</p>
<p>Buffy slowly turned.</p>
<p>"Okay, sit on the john."</p>
<p>Faith sat. Buffy started to put some salve on the wounds and then she bandaged them. After that, Faith went to her room to dress herself and Buffy took a quick shower. When she got to the kitchen, Faith was already eating. She joined her.</p>
<p>"Are the cops still outside?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Do they have a car?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Good, they can escort us then."</p>
<p>"Escort?" Joyce said, puzzled.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Faith's been kidnapped and we don't want those three guys to get kidnap her again."</p>
<p>"She's been kidnapped?" Joyce said, puzzled.</p>
<p>"No, it's just a story we made up."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"You're gonna drive us to the station, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, of course."</p>
<p>"Good."</p>

<hr/>

<p>When they got to the station, Faith was very nervous, so Buffy took her hand and that seemed to calm her down a bit. Detective Stern took their statements and then let them go since he had nothing on Faith. He did promise to look for the kidnappers. Joyce then drove them home.</p>

<hr/>

<p>After lunch, they went to Giles.</p>
<p>"You ready to face them?" Buffy asked as they walked to the door.</p>
<p>Faith hesitated for a moment and then nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>Buffy took her hand and squeezed it reassuringly.</p>
<p>When they entered, the entire Scooby Gang was there.</p>
<p>"Hi, guys," Buffy said.</p>
<p>Faith wanted to run away when the conversation stopped and everyone looked at her. Buffy apparently noticed her discomfort, because she gently squeezed her hand again, calming her.</p>
<p>"Hello," Giles said. "Have you been to the police?"</p>
<p>"Yes. She's free."</p>
<p>"That's good," Giles said and looked at Faith. "Welcome back, Faith."</p>
<p>"Thanks," Faith said nervously.</p>
<p>"Do you still have nightmares?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Good. And you remember everything?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>"I told the cops that those Council guys kidnapped Faith and tortured her," Buffy said.</p>
<p>"You have?" Giles said, slightly worried.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I gave the cops their description. And you call the Council that they better stay the hell away from Sunnydale or else."</p>
<p>"Eh, already told them that," Giles said, fixing his glasses.</p>
<p>"You have?" Buffy said, surprised.</p>
<p>"Yes, last night."</p>
<p>Buffy grinned.</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>"Em," Faith started hesitantly and everyone looked at her, "I'd like to apologize."</p>
<p>"That's okay," Willow said, "it wasn't your fault."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Xander added. "I mean, it was scary, but it wasn't your fault."</p>
<p>"Xander's mine now," Anya said, hugging his arm.</p>
<p>Buffy then noticed Riley.</p>
<p>"Oh, I almost forgot. Faith, this is Riley. And that is Tara," she pointed at Willow's girlfriend.</p>
<p>"Hi," Faith said, waving at both of them with her free hand.</p>
<p>"Hello," Riley said, eyeing the two hands that held one another.</p>
<p>"Hi," Tara said.</p>
<p>Faith noticed what Riley was looking at and she quickly withdrew her hand, nervously. Buffy was confused at first, but then she realized that she and Faith had been holding hands and that Riley must have noticed. She blushed a bit, remembering that it wasn't the first time. She sighed and went to him.</p>
<p>"Hey," she said and hugged him.</p>
<p>Riley smiled.</p>
<p>"Hey," he said back and hugged her.</p>
<p>Faith felt a bit weird standing alone in the middle of the room, so she went to the empty chair and sat down.</p>
<p>"So, em, how do you feel?" Willow asked her.</p>
<p>Faith shrugged.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>"Em, if you want, Tara and I could do a healing spell to help you heal," Willow offered. "Tara's also a wiccan," she added.</p>
<p>"No, thanks," Faith said, feeling a bit strange that the people she had hurt and who had hated her were now her friends. Again. "So, em, are you two... together?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Willow said with a smile and took Tara's hand.</p>
<p>"So, em, anything new on the Adam scene?" Buffy asked, breaking the silence that followed.</p>
<p>"No, I'm afraid," Giles said.</p>
<p>"No, we still have no idea where he is," Riley said when Buffy looked at her.</p>
<p>"Who's Adam?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>Buffy looked at her.</p>
<p>"A prototype for a perfect soldier the Initiative put together. He's a human/demon/robot hybrid and he's very dangerous."</p>
<p>"What's the Initiative?"</p>
<p>"A secret military organization. They study demons."</p>
<p>"And make them better," Xander grumbled.</p>
<p>"Riley works for them, but he's helping us out."</p>
<p>"Oh," Faith said, trying to digest the new information.</p>
<p>"Em, Faith, do you feel up to training?" Giles asked.</p>
<p>Faith thought for a moment.</p>
<p>"No. I'd like to get the bandages off first."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's a good idea," Giles agreed.</p>
<p>"So, em, are you two coming to the Bronze tonight?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>Buffy and Faith looked at one another.</p>
<p>"Sure," Faith said, shrugging.</p>

<hr/>

<p>"Okay, guys, we're leaving now," Buffy said after a while.</p>
<p>"Already?" Riley said.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I promised Faith I'll take her to the cemetery."</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Faith, who looked down, nervous.</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"We'll se you guys later," Buffy said and got up.</p>
<p>Almost as an afterthought, she gave Riley a goodbye kiss. Faith got up as well and they left.</p>
<p>"You okay?" Buffy asked outside.</p>
<p>Faith took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"Yeah. It went better than expected."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I never thought Willow would play for the home team."</p>
<p>Buffy chuckled.</p>
<p>"Me neither."</p>
<p>"And it doesn't freak you out?"</p>
<p>Buffy frowned and looked at Faith, confused.</p>
<p>"Why would it freak me out?"</p>
<p>"Well, I mean," Faith said nervously, "your best friend is gay. I mean, it doesn't bother me, obviously, it's just..."</p>
<p>"You thought it would bother me because I never responded to your innuendoes."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Faith said, regretting that she had started the conversation.</p>
<p>Buffy stared at her for a few moments and then thought.</p>
<p>"It doesn't bother me. I mean, it surprised me, yes, but it doesn't freak me out or anything."</p>
<p>"Oh." She hesitated for a moment. "And... Riley?"</p>
<p>Buffy thought for a moment.</p>
<p>"I met him in college. He's a TA and I had no idea he worked for the Initiative. Hell, I didn't even know the Initiative existed."</p>
<p>"Where's their base?"</p>
<p>"Beneath the Lowell House. At least, I don't know how big the base really is."</p>
<p>"Oh." Faith hesitated for a moment. "Em, is it okay with you and your mom if I... stay with you?" she then asked nervously.</p>
<p>Buffy looked at her.</p>
<p>"Of course. I mean, I don't think it would be a good idea if you stayed alone, you would be an easy target for the Council and you never know if the nightmares will come back. I mean, I hope they don't, but you never know."</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Thanks."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"No problem."</p>

<hr/>

<p>"This is Professor Wirth's grave," Buffy said when they arrived to the grave.</p>
<p>Faith took a deep breath and stepped closer. Buffy remained a couple of steps behind to give her some privacy. Faith stared at the tombstone for a while.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Professor," she finally said and a few tears ran down her cheeks.</p>
<p>She started to sob and Buffy stepped closer, took her hand and squeezed it reassuringly. Faith quickly wiped her tears.</p>
<p>"It's okay to cry," Buffy said.</p>
<p>Faith glanced at her and after a couple of moments of hesitation let the tears run their course for a while. She finally took a deep breath and then wiped the tears.</p>
<p>"And where's Finch's grave?"</p>
<p>"This way," Buffy said and led the way.</p>

<hr/>

<p>As they walked to Finch's grave, Buffy suddenly realized that she and Faith were still holding hands. Her first impulse was to break the contact, but then she decided against it. Faith obviously didn't mind and she herself apparently not either, since she didn't even notice until now. And even though she was supposed to be with Riley, she felt herself attracted to Faith It was confusing.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, they arrived to Finch's grave. Buffy wanted to let go of Faith's hand and remain a few steps behind to give Faith some privacy, but Faith didn't let go of her hand. So they approached the grave together.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Allan," Faith said after a few moments and shuddered as she remembered the incident.</p>
<p>"It wasn't your fault," Buffy said.</p>
<p>"Then why do I feel guilty?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>Buffy sighed and gently squeezed Faith's hand.</p>
<p>"Come, let's go home and get ready for the Bronze."</p>
<p>Faith took a deep breath and then wiped her tears.</p>

<hr/>

<p>When they got to the Bronze, the entire Scooby gang was there, including Riley. Buffy went to him and sat in his lap, but she immediately started to feel guilty. She frowned, realizing that she felt like she was cheating on Faith. Her frown deepened when she realized that she was sort of cheating on Riley. She sighed, confused.</p>
<p>Faith found herself a seat beside Tara, who smiled at her.</p>
<p>"When are you going on patrol?" Willow asked Buffy.</p>
<p>"In a while. I wanna dance a bit at first." She glanced at the stage. "When they put on some decent music."</p>

<hr/>

<p>Finally, the music changed.</p>
<p>"Faith, you wanna dance?" Buffy asked and everyone looked at her.</p>
<p>Faith thought about the offer, nervous. A year ago, she would've accepted the offer in no time, but now...</p>
<p>"No, I don't feel like dancing," she said.</p>
<p>"Okay," Buffy said and looked at Riley. "Riley?"</p>
<p>"Sure," Riley said.</p>
<p>They got up and went to the dance floor.</p>
<p>"I gotta go to the ladies room," Faith said and also left.</p>
<p>"Okay, am I missing something?" Xander then asked.</p>
<p>"They're in love," Anya said.</p>
<p>"Who's in love?" Xander asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>"Buffy and Faith. What?" she said when Xander, Willow and Tara stared at her.</p>
<p>"Buffy and Faith?" Willow asked incredulously.</p>
<p>"Yes," Anya said. "It's obvious."</p>
<p>"It is," Tara quietly agreed and Willow and Xander looked at her, surprised.</p>
<p>"See?" Anya said and smiled.</p>
<p>"And just how is it obvious?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>"They spend a lot of time together and Buffy is seriously ignoring Riley Then there are the looks between them and the holding of hands, which Buffy does often, even if she's not aware of it. And she just asked Faith to dance with her."</p>
<p>Xander and Willow looked at one another, thinking.</p>
<p>"She could just be trying to help Faith get used to being normal again," Willow said.</p>
<p>"Oh please," Anya said. "We all know Faith's in love with Buffy and Buffy's definitely in love with Faith, even if she's not admitting it to herself. Yet. I think even Riley knows it."</p>
<p>Xander, Willow and Tara looked at Riley, who was dancing with Buffy.</p>
<p>"You think?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>"Yes. Didn't you see the way he looked at Buffy when she asked Faith to dance? Or when they're holding hands and don't even know it?"</p>
<p>Faith then came back and everyone looked at her.</p>
<p>"What?" she asked nervously.</p>
<p>Anya was about to answer, but Xander silenced her with a kiss.</p>
<p>"Wow," Anya said when they stopped kissing. "Can we do this again?"</p>
<p>Xander grinned.</p>
<p>"Later."</p>
<p>"Okay," Anya said and hugged his arm, excited, forgetting about Faith's question.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Since Faith didn't feel like patrolling, Buffy went on patrol with Riley</p>
<p>"She seems a nice girl," Riley said as the walked across the park.</p>
<p>"What?" Buffy said, startled.</p>
<p>"Faith, she seems like a nice girl," Riley repeated.</p>
<p>"Oh." She smiled. "Yes, she is. And she's a lot... I don't know, she's not so wild anymore."</p>
<p>"Wild?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. I mean, before she basically lived to have fun and she flirted with everyone." She hesitated for a moment. "She had sex every day. But now, she's so... serious. I think she's afraid that it's not over yet."</p>
<p>"Is it?"</p>
<p>Buffy shrugged.</p>
<p>"I don't know. I hope so."</p>

<hr/>

<p>"Hey, Mom," Buffy said when she got home.</p>
<p>"Hi, honey."</p>
<p>"Is Faith home?"</p>
<p>"Yes, she's upstairs."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Buffy went upstairs and knocked on Faith's door.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" Faith's voice came from the room and Buffy entered.</p>
<p>"Hey," she said.</p>
<p>"Hey," Faith responded.</p>
<p>"Did you have a good time?"</p>
<p>"Yeah." She sighed. "I need to relax."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Everything okay on your patrol?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Three vamps, we dusted them."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>Buffy hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna take a shower now."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled and left, and Faith leaned back on the bed and sighed.</p>

<hr/>

<p>After the shower, Buffy automatically went to Faith's room.</p>
<p>"Oh," she said when she sat on the bed. "Em, do you want to sleep alone? I mean, now that you've been hypnotized and stuff?"</p>
<p>Faith thought for a moment and then nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I wanna try."</p>
<p>"Okay," Buffy said and got up. "Good night then."</p>
<p>"Night," Faith said.</p>
<p>"Oh," Buffy remembered, "did you check your wounds?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"And?"</p>
<p>"I think I'll be able to take most of the bandages off tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Okay," Buffy said with a smile. "Night."</p>
<p>"Night."</p>

<hr/>

<p>When Buffy woke up in the morning, she was confused at first because Faith wasn't there. Then she realized that she was in her own bed and she remembered that Faith had wanted to sleep alone. She took a deep breath and got up.</p>

<hr/>

<p>When Faith woke up, she was also confused when Buffy wasn't by her side. She was worried for a moment, but then she remembered that she had told Buffy that she wanted to sleep alone. She sighed and got up.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Buffy was just finishing her breakfast when Faith came into the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Hey," she said with a smile.</p>
<p>Faith smiled back a bit.</p>
<p>"Hey."</p>
<p>"Sleep well?"</p>
<p>Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"Yeah," she said as she sat down.</p>
<p>"But?" Buffy asked when she noticed that Faith was hesitating.</p>
<p>Faith shook her head.</p>
<p>"N-Nothing," she said and starting to fill her bowl with cereals.</p>
<p>Buffy stopped eating.</p>
<p>"Talk to me, Faith. You know how dangerous it is to keep it all inside."</p>
<p>Faith bit her teeth, hesitating.</p>
<p>"I-I k-kinda got used to y-you b-being there w-with me," she said nervously, looking at the table.</p>
<p>"Oh," Buffy said with a smile. "I... I kinda missed it too," she admitted. She hesitated for a moment. "Em, if you want, I can sleep with you again" Then her eyes went wide as she realized how that sounded. "I-I mean, you know, share the bed."</p>
<p>Faith looked at her, surprised.</p>
<p>"N-No, it's o-okay. I-I need to g-get used to s-sleeping alone. "</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"Okay. But if you change your mind, let me know."</p>
<p>"A-Are you s-sure? I-I mean, now th-that you kn-know how I f-feel about y-you?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"O-Okay."</p>
<p>Buffy hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>"I noticed you stutter when you're nervous."</p>
<p>"Y-Yeah," Faith said, embarrassed.</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"I think it's cute."</p>
<p>Faith looked at her.</p>
<p>"I'm not cute," she protested and Buffy chuckled.</p>
<p>"Sure you are."</p>
<p>"Am not," Faith said and glared at her.</p>
<p>"Are too."</p>
<p>"Am not," Faith said and pouted.</p>
<p>Buffy chuckled.</p>
<p>"Even your pout is cute."</p>
<p>"Is not."</p>
<p>"Is too."</p>
<p>"Is not."</p>
<p>"What's wrong, girls?" Joyce asked as she entered the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Nothing," Faith quickly said, blushing.</p>
<p>"I was telling her that I find her stuttering cute," Buffy explained much to Faith's chagrin. "And her pout."</p>
<p>Joyce looked at Faith, who was still pouting, and smiled.</p>
<p>"It is pretty, yes."</p>
<p>"See," Buffy said victoriously and Faith blushed, embarrassed.</p>
<p>"Go ahead, embarrass me in front of your mom," she murmured and started to eat.</p>
<p>Buffy chuckled.</p>
<p>"Sorry, I didn't mean to embarrass you," she said, but Faith pointedly ignored her.</p>
<p>"Children," Joyce said, shaking her head with a smile, and went to the sink.</p>
<p>"We're not children," Buffy protested.</p>
<p>"Yes, you are," Faith said and Buffy looked at her, surprised.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"You act like a big kid."</p>
<p>"Says the biggest kid in the world."</p>
<p>Faith stuck out her tongue at Buffy and Buffy did the same.</p>
<p>"You're both children," Joyce said, smiling at the Slayers' antics.</p>
<p>"Mom!" Buffy protested.</p>
<p>Faith grinned.</p>
<p>"Serves you right."</p>
<p>Buffy looked at her.</p>
<p>"She said you were a kid too."</p>
<p>"I'm younger than you."</p>
<p>"One year, so?</p>
<p>"So you're supposed to be the responsible one."</p>
<p>"Bite me."</p>
<p>"Where?"</p>
<p>Buffy's eyes went wide and then she chuckled.</p>
<p>"I'm glad you back to normal," she said.</p>
<p>Faith blushed a bit.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it's good to be back."</p>
<p>Buffy hesitated for a moment."</p>
<p>"Did you check your wounds?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"And?"</p>
<p>"They're mostly healed, except for the long one," Faith said and ran her hand across her body. "It's not that bad, but I put the bandage on anyway. I'll take it off tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Okay." Buffy thought for a moment. "So, em, are you gonna practice with me today?"</p>
<p>Faith thought about it.</p>
<p>"Just the workout and some light sparring."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>

<hr/>

<p>In the evening, Faith couldn't fall asleep. Sure, she had no problem the previous night, but she missed Buffy's closeness. She knew Buffy didn't return her feelings, but that didn't stop Faith from wanting to be near her. And strangely enough, she didn't even felt the need to have sex with Buffy, she just wanted to be with her. She hesitated for a while and then went to Buffy's room. After all, Buffy had offered to stay with her. She hesitated for a few moments and then knocked on the door.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" came Buffy's sleepy voice.</p>
<p>Faith opened the door and entered the room. She stopped, hesitantly, not so sure anymore if this was a good idea.</p>
<p>But Buffy guessed what Faith wanted. She uncovered the blanket and moved back in the bed. Faith hesitated for a moment. Then she closed the door and walked to the bed. She hesitated again and then climbed in. Buffy then covered them with the blanket.</p>
<p>"Th-Thanks," Faith whispered.</p>
<p>"You're welcome," Buffy said.</p>

<hr/>

<p>When Buffy woke up in the morning, she found Faith cuddled up to her. She smiled at the sight, she never thought Faith liked to cuddle. She caressed her, but then she realized what she was doing and she quickly removed her hand. She was confused. She was with Riley and she liked him, but now her feelings for Faith were resurfacing. She frowned at the thought. Resurfacing? Had she been having feelings for Faith before? She thought for a while and came to the conclusion that she had, right after they had met and she got over the initial jealousy. And she liked Faith's innuendoes, in spite of the fact that they made her nervous and afraid of her own feelings, which she had then been reluctant to admit to herself. She realized that she was still reluctant to admit it to herself that she loved Faith. She frowned. She loved Faith? But she was with Riley. It was confusing.</p>
<p>Her reverie was interrupted by Faith, who started to wake up. First, Faith hugged her even tighter. Then she apparently realized where she was and her eyes went wide open and she backed off.</p>
<p>"I'm s-sorry, I-I'm so s-sorry. I-I didn't m-mean to..."</p>
<p>"It's okay, Faith," Buffy quickly interrupted her apology. She smiled. "It's okay."</p>
<p>Faith took a deep breath to calm down.</p>
<p>"I-I'll go d-dress," she said and got up.</p>
<p>"Okay," Buffy said. "I'll see you at breakfast."</p>
<p>Faith nodded and quickly left.</p>
<p>Buffy lay back and sighed, wondering again about her feelings for Faith.</p>

<hr/>

<p>"You removed the bandage," Buffy noticed with a smile when she came to the kitchen and saw Faith.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it's healing nicely."</p>
<p>"Good. Does that mean you're ready to kick some demon ass?"</p>
<p>Faith thought for a moment.</p>
<p>"I don't know. I'll see after the training today."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>

<hr/>

<p>In the evening, both Slayers went on patrol together. Faith was a bit nervous as the memory of killing Finch kept resurfacing in her mind, but after she dusted the first vamp, she calmed down a bit and became more confident.</p>
<p>"You okay?" Buffy asked when she saw Faith stare at the vamp's ashes.</p>
<p>Faith looked at her.</p>
<p>"Yeah," she said and took a deep breath. "Let's move on."</p>

<hr/>

<p>After a while, they came across a vamp, who ran away from them. They followed him into some caves and Buffy let Faith dust him.</p>
<p>"Two Slayers?"</p>
<p>The Slayers jerked, startled, and looked at Adam.</p>
<p>"What the fuck?" Faith said.</p>
<p>"Faith, meet Adam."</p>
<p>"Shit."</p>
<p>"An interesting development," Adam said and approached them. "But I don't need two Slayers," he said and attacked.</p>
<p>Buffy fought back, while Faith just stood for a couple of moments and observed. She noticed that Adam was way too good for Buffy alone, so she joined the fight. It didn't take her long to realize that Adam was way too good for the both of them together.</p>
<p>"Em, Buffy, I think we should get out..."</p>
<p>She trailed off with a scream as the stake-like protrusion from Adam's Polgara-demon arm pierced her shoulder.</p>
<p>"Faith!" Buffy screamed, worried sick about Faith.</p>
<p>She attacked Adam furiously until she managed to trip him. Then she quicky picked up Faith and ran out, hoping that Adam wouldn't follow.</p>
<p>Adam slowly got up, smiling, and returned to his lair.</p>
<p>"Don't die on me, Faith," Buffy said as she ran to the hospital, tears running down her cheeks.</p>

<hr/>

<p>While the doctors took care of Faith, Buffy nervously paced up and down the waiting room, causing the people to stare at her. She was so deep in her thoughts that she didn't noticed a nurse until the nurse touched her. Then Buffy jerked and faces the nurse, ready to fight. She relaxed when she saw it was only a nurse.</p>
<p>"Is she out yet?" she asked.</p>
<p>"No, not yet," the nurse said.</p>
<p>"Oh," Buffy said, disappointed.</p>
<p>"Have you called her family yet?"</p>
<p>"I am her family," Buffy said.</p>
<p>"Oh. Your mother then?"</p>
<p>Buffy sighed.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then I suggest you call her. It might take your mind off of what happened."</p>
<p>Buffy sighed.</p>
<p>"Where's a phone?"</p>
<p>"You can use mine," the nurse said and led the way to the info desk.</p>
<p>"Thanks," Buffy said and dialed the number.</p>
<p><i>"Summers residence,"</i> Joyce said.</p>
<p>"Mom, it's me. I'm at the hospital."</p>
<p><i>"Are you okay?"</i> Joyce asked, worried.</p>
<p>"I'm fine, but Faith's been wounded by Adam."</p>
<p><i>"How is she?"</i></p>
<p>"I don't know, the doctors are still taking care of the wound."</p>
<p><i>"I'll be right there. Have you called Mr Giles yet?"</i></p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p><i>"Then I'll call him."</i></p>
<p>"Thanks, Mom," Buffy said and hung up.</p>

<hr/>

<p>When Joyce arrived ten minutes later, Faith was still in surgery.</p>
<p>"Honey?"</p>
<p>"Oh Mom," Buffy said and hugged Joyce.</p>
<p>Joyce hugged her back.</p>
<p>"Was it bad?" she asked.</p>
<p>"He skewered her shoulder with that thing that comes from his arm."</p>
<p>"Oh," Joyce said, having no idea what Buffy was talking about.</p>
<p>"Em, Miss?"</p>
<p>Buffy let go of her mother and looked at the doctor.</p>
<p>"Yes?" she said anxiously.</p>
<p>"Your friend will be okay."</p>
<p>"Really? Can I see her?"</p>
<p>"As soon as she's taken to her room. But make it short, okay?"</p>
<p>"Okay," Buffy said, nodding.</p>

<hr/>

<p>The Scooby Gang arrived a few minutes later.</p>
<p>"How is she, Buffy?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"The doctor said she'll be okay. They've just taken her to her room."</p>
<p>"Was it Adam?" Riley asked.</p>
<p>"Yes. We were following a vamp into some caves. We dusted him, but then Adam showed up." She frowned. "He said he didn't need two Slayers. Then he attacked us."</p>
<p>"I see," Giles said, thinking.</p>
<p>"What did he mean by that?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"Miss?"</p>
<p>Buffy turned.</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"You can go in now," the doctor said and then looked the Scoobs. "But make it short. And only go in one by one, if you all plan to go see her."</p>
<p>"Thanks," Buffy said and entered.</p>
<p>She slowly approached Faith's bed and took her hand. A few tears slid down her cheek and she wiped them. She stared at Faith for a while and she finally admitted it to herself, she loved Faith. But then she remembered Riley and she sighed. She liked Riley, but she didn't love him, not the way she loved Faith. She knew she had to break up with him, but she had no idea what to tell him.</p>
<p>"Buffy."</p>
<p>Buffy jerked and turned.</p>
<p>"Mom?"</p>
<p>"I think we should leave now."</p>
<p>"But I just got here."</p>
<p>"You've been here an hour."</p>
<p>Buffy frowned and looked at her watch.</p>
<p>"Wow," she said when she saw it was true.</p>
<p>"Come, you can come back tomorrow."</p>
<p>Buffy sighed.</p>
<p>"Okay. Can I skip my classes?"</p>
<p>Joyce raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"But I wanna be here, in case she wakes up."</p>
<p>"I'll go visit her," Joyce said. "And I can bring a fresh set of clothes"</p>
<p>"Thanks, Mom," Buffy said and hugged her.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In the evening, Buffy couldn't fall asleep for a long time. She tossed and turned, thinking about Faith. She had accepted the fact that she loved Faith and she was worried that she might never tell her that. And there was also the Riley situation. She needed to break up with him at once, but she wanted to do it gently.</p>

<hr/>

<p>After school was over the next day, Buffy went home, got something to eat and then hurried to the hospital.</p>
<p>"Mom?" she asked quietly as she entered the room.</p>
<p>Joyce turned and smiled.</p>
<p>"Hi, honey."</p>
<p>"Did she wake up yet?"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid not."</p>
<p>Buffy sighed and sat down.</p>
<p>"What did the doctor say?"</p>
<p>"He thinks she'll wake up today."</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>"I'll go home now. Faith's clothes are over there," Joyce said and pointed at the clothes. "Have you eaten?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Mom."</p>
<p>"Good. I'll come back later."</p>
<p>"Okay, Mom."</p>
<p>"Bye, honey," Joyce said and left.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Several hours later, Riley came. He stopped by the door and observed Buffy for a few moments before entering. He wasn't trying to be silent, but Buffy was obviously so deep in her thoughts that she didn't hear him as he approached her. He noticed that she was holding Faith's hand and was gently moving her thumb in circles across the upper side. He sighed as he realized that it was probably over between them.</p>
<p>"Do you love her?" he asked.</p>
<p>Buffy jerked, startled, and looked at him.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Do you love her?" he repeated his question.</p>
<p>"I... I..." Buffy took a deep breath to calm down. "Yes," she said, glancing at Faith.</p>
<p>"Thought so."</p>
<p>"Riley..."</p>
<p>"I know," Riley interrupted her. "It's over between us."</p>
<p>Buffy sighed.</p>
<p>"Yes." She hesitated for a moment. "Are we still friends?"</p>
<p>Riley nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>"I'll see you later."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Riley hesitated and then left.</p>
<p>Buffy took another deep breath, relieved, and looked back at Faith again</p>

<hr/>

<p>Riley was just leaving the hospital when Joyce came again.</p>
<p>"Hello, Riley."</p>
<p>"Hello, Mrs Summers."</p>
<p>"Have you been to Buffy?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Is something wrong?" Joyce asked, noticing that he was not very happy.</p>
<p>"We broke up."</p>
<p>"Oh." She thought for a moment about what to say. "Has Faith woke up yet?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"Em, I have to go, Mrs Summers."</p>
<p>"Yes, of course. Goodbye."</p>
<p>Riley left and Joyce entered the hospital.</p>

<hr/>

<p>When Joyce entered Faith's room, she noticed that Buffy was playing with Faith's hair. She had had a feeling lately that there was more going on between Faith and Buffy than met the eye and the fact that Buffy had broken up with Riley only seemed to confirm it.</p>
<p>"Hi, honey," she said with a smile.</p>
<p>Buffy jerked.</p>
<p>"Hi, Mom," she said.</p>
<p>Joyce hesitated.</p>
<p>"Do you love her?"</p>
<p>"What?" Buffy said, surprised. "Is it so obvious?"</p>
<p>Joyce smiled again.</p>
<p>"Yes," she said.</p>
<p>"Seems like everyone knew it before I did."</p>
<p>"Really?" Joyce said, surprised.</p>
<p>"Yes, I was only certain of it last night."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>Buffy hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>"Riley and I broke up."</p>
<p>"Yes, I know, I met him outside."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"How did he take it?"</p>
<p>Buffy sighed.</p>
<p>"He seemed to have guessed that I love Faith. He said we're still friends."</p>
<p>"That's good."</p>
<p>"Yeah." Buffy hesitated for a moment. "Is it okay with you?"</p>
<p>Joyce nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes. When I saw you sleeping together, I first thought that you were only there so you could wake up Faith if she had a nightmare."</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"I was. But then we kinda got used to sleeping together and I liked it. I mean, I knew Faith loved me, but I wasn't sure how I felt about her. Still, I liked being closed to her, you know? So we continued to sleep together, even though Faith doesn't have nightmares anymore."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>"And it doesn't bother you?" Buffy asked anxiously.</p>
<p>Joyce smiled.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Buffy heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>"I brought you a little something to eat," Joyce said and gave Buffy a small packet.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Mom."</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr Giles called. He says that they are trying to find out what this Adam might want."</p>
<p>"Okay," Buffy said and started to eat.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Joyce left an hour and a long mother/daughter conversation later and Buffy was alone with Faith again. Another hour passed and then suddenly Faith's monitor started to beep wildly.</p>
<p>"Faith?" Buffy said, worried.</p>
<p>Faith gasped and opened her eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh Faith," Buffy said and hugged her, tears running down her eyes.</p>
<p>The Faith moaned when Buffy pressed on her wound. Buffy immediately let go.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you."</p>
<p>"How long?" Faith interrupted her anxiously, rubbing her shoulder.</p>
<p>Buffy frowned.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"How long have I been out?"</p>
<p>"Oh. Since last night," Buffy said and Faith heaved a sigh of relief. "How do you feel?"</p>
<p>"My shoulder still hurts a bit."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"Did you get the bastard?"</p>
<p>"No. I managed to trip him. Then I grabbed you and got the hell out of there."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"You feel ready to go home?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll get the doctor," Buffy said and got up. "Oh, before I forget" She leaned in and gave Faith a passionate kiss. "I love you too, Faith," she said when she broke the kiss. "I'll be right back."</p>
<p>Buffy left and Faith stared after her, astonished, wondering if her mind was playing tricks on her.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Buffy returned a minute later with the doctor.</p>
<p>"How do you feel?" the doctor asked Faith as he took her chart.</p>
<p>"Fine," Faith said, glancing at Buffy. "My shoulder hurts a bit."</p>
<p>"Let's see."</p>
<p>The doctor took off the bandages and took a look at the wound.</p>
<p>"Hmm, not bad," he said and glanced at Faith. "You're a fast healer."</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>He pressed on the wound.</p>
<p>"Does that hurt?"</p>
<p>"No more than it already did."</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>"Can she go home now?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"I can't see why not," the doctor said and looked at Faith. "But I want you back if it starts to hurt more."</p>
<p>Faith nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"I'll need you to fill in some paperwork."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>The doctor left and Faith got up. She hesitated for a moment.</p>
<p>"Did... Did you really mean it?" she then asked.</p>
<p>Buffy smiled and came closer.</p>
<p>"Want me to say it again?" she asked and leaned in for a kiss.</p>
<p>Faith wanted to kiss her, but she needed to know where she stood.</p>
<p>"What about... Riley?"</p>
<p>"We broke up."</p>
<p>"Because of me?"</p>
<p>Buffy sighed.</p>
<p>"Because of me. He guessed that I was in love with you, so we broke up."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>Buffy cupped Faith's cheek.</p>
<p>"Don't feel guilty about it," she said and Faith nodded. "So, how about a kiss?"</p>
<p>Faith gulped and then leaned in. Buffy smiled and leaned in as well. The kiss started out as lips only, but then progressed to a more passionate variant, involving their tongues as well.</p>
<p>"Wow," Buffy said when they stopped.</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"Yeah," she said, breathing heavily.</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"Okay, dress up so we can go home."</p>
<p>Faith nodded and Buffy turned around to give Faith some privacy. Faith quickly dropped the medical gown and put on the clothes that Joyce had brought.</p>
<p>"Okay," she said when she was done.</p>
<p>Buffy turned and went closer.</p>
<p>"Let's go fill out that paperwork and then go home," she said as she took Faith's hand.</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"I never had a home before."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled as well.</p>
<p>"You do now."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>Faith hesitated for a moment and then kissed Buffy. Buffy responded and they kissed for a few moments.</p>
<p>"Oxygen," Buffy finally said and they stopped. "Whoa boy, "she said. "Next time we do that, we better make sure we sit or someday we're just gonna crash to the floor."</p>
<p>Faith grinned.</p>
<p>"We can also lay down."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"That too," she agreed. "Come on, let's go fill out those papers."</p>

<hr/>

<p>"Mom! We're home!" Buffy called when she and Faith entered the house.</p>
<p>Joyce came from the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Faith?"</p>
<p>Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"Hi."</p>
<p>"How do you feel?"</p>
<p>"Fine. The shoulder still hurts a bit, that's all."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"Why don't you take a shower and then we'll go to Giles' place," Buffy said.</p>
<p>"Okay," Faith said and went upstairs.</p>
<p>Buffy stared after her until she was gone and then looked at Joyce.</p>
<p>"I told her," she said and smiled.</p>
<p>"That you love her?"</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes. We're together now."</p>
<p>Joyce smiled.</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>"I'm gonna go to my room."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>

<hr/>

<p>After Faith dressed after the shower, she went to Buffy's room.</p>
<p>"I'm ready," she said.</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"Then let's go," she said and got up from the bed. "Oh, by the way, Mom knows that we're together."</p>
<p>"S-She does?" Faith asked, worried.</p>
<p>Buffy nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah. She already guessed that I love you, but after you went off to shower, I told her that we're together now."</p>
<p>"Oh." She hesitated for a moment. "A-And she d-doesn't m-mind?"</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"No," she said and gave Faith a peck on the nose.</p>
<p>"Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Positive," Buffy assured her. "We can kiss all we want." She frowned. "Well, not too much, at least not in front of her."</p>
<p>Faith grinned.</p>
<p>"How about now?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Now's good," Buffy agreed and they kissed.</p>

<hr/>

<p>"So, are you ready?" Buffy asked as she and Faith walked up to Giles' door.</p>
<p>Faith took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"No, not really," she said and sighed. "Let's do it."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"Okay," she said and they entered.</p>
<p>All eyes were immediately on Faith.</p>
<p>"How do you feel, Faith?" Giles asked.</p>
<p>"The shoulder's still hurting a bit."</p>
<p>"I see."</p>
<p>Buffy saw that Riley was also there and she got nervous. She took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"Did you tell them?" she asked.</p>
<p>"No," Riley said.</p>
<p>"Then I guess I should do it."</p>
<p>"Tell us what?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>Buffy and Faith glanced at one another and Faith gently squeezed Buffy's hands in reassurance.</p>
<p>"Faith and I are... together now."</p>
<p>"Ha, told you," Anya said victoriously.</p>
<p>Everyone else glanced at Riley.</p>
<p>"What about... Riley?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>Buffy glanced at him.</p>
<p>"We broke up."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"And you two are now together?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Does your mom knows?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"How did she react?"</p>
<p>"She kinda guessed herself."</p>
<p>"Oh. And she's okay with it?"</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"Em, did you f-find out why A-Adam only n-needs one S-Slayer?" Faith changed the topic.</p>
<p>"No, I'm afraid not," Giles said.</p>
<p>"When we find out how to kill him, he's gonna be so sorry," Buffy said angrily.</p>
<p>Faith looked at her lovingly and gently squeezed her hand in thanks.</p>

<hr/>

<p>As she and Faith lay in bed in the evening, Buffy felt that Faith was nervous.</p>
<p>"Wanna cuddle?" she asked.</p>
<p>Faith hesitated for a moment and then cuddled up to Buffy, who put her arm under Faith's head, pressing her closer.</p>
<p>"What?" she asked when she saw that Buffy was smiling.</p>
<p>"Oh nothing," Buffy said. "Just, you know, I never thought you liked to cuddle."</p>
<p>Faith blushed a bit.</p>
<p>"I-I never c-cuddled before."</p>
<p>"Then I guess we should make up for it," Buffy said and Faith smiled.</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>They stared into one another's eyes for a few moments and Faith then hugged Buffy tighter.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" Buffy asked, feeling that something was bothering Faith.</p>
<p>"N-Nothing," Faith said.</p>
<p>"Talk to me, Faith," Buffy said, worried. "Please. You don't have to pretend to be this invincible Slayer, it's okay to be weak sometimes."</p>
<p>Faith gulped, hesitating.</p>
<p>"I-I'm scared," she then quietly admitted.</p>
<p>"Of what?"</p>
<p>"Of w-waking up and f-finding that this was j-just a dream."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled softly and gently caressed Faith.</p>
<p>"It's not," she said and pressed her closer to herself. "It's not."</p>
<p>They lay quietly, hugging, and then Buffy chuckled.</p>
<p>"What is it?" Faith asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>"Oh, I just realized something. We've been sleeping together for a while now and we still haven't had sex. I mean, I'm not complaining or anything, it's just, you know..."</p>
<p>She trailed off, sighing.</p>
<p>"We can, if you want," Faith said.</p>
<p>Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"No, it's okay," she said. "I'm not with you because of sex. And I still have to get used to the idea of having sex with another girl. I mean, I've accepted the fact that I love another girl, but I still have to get used to the idea of having sex with another girl."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"I want to take things slow, you know, we have time. I want us both to be ready and then you can show me just how experienced you are in all things sex."</p>
<p>Faith blushed a bit.</p>
<p>"O-Okay," she said.</p>
<p>"And until then, I'll be more than happy to cuddle with you."</p>
<p>Faith smiled, blushing. She was surprised that she was nervous when it came to having sex with Buffy, she was never nervous when it came to sex, but when it came to Buffy, her heart started pounding wildly. Buffy caressed her and Faith smiled at her. She sighed and hugged her even more tightly, afraid to wake up and find out that it was all just a dream.</p>
<p>Buffy smiled at Faith as she snuggled closer to her, and gave her a kiss on the forehead. Faith seemed so different from the wild child she used to be, but the she felt that even though Faith was very shy now, she was basically still the same girl, minus the Council's conditioning, and she wanted to wait with sex until Faith recovered from the horrific experiences of the past.</p>
