<!-- Snowbound \ Chapter Five -->

<p>Randi grunted as she pitched the fifty-pound bag of dog food into the rear of the Jeep, then made a show of dusting off her hands. "Piece 'o' cake," she grinned crookedly at the big man who eyed her with stern disapproval.</p>
		<p>"Look, 'Ms. Tuff-Stuff'," he wagged a finger at her. "We both know you're young, healthy-as-a-horse, and you lift weights, but it wouldn't have hurt you to let me load that for you," he mock-scolded.</p>
		<p>Randi looked down contritely, scuffing the snow with the toe of her boot. "I know, uncle," she mumbled, using the more familiar name she always called the older man. "But I've got to show off these awesome muscles to somebody," she grinned rakishly, while curling her arm in a 'muscle' pose.</p>
		<p>"Lord, save me from cocky little girls," he chuckled, as he placed the rest of her purchases in the back.</p>
		<p>The tall woman was closing the car door when a sudden thought hit her, and she turned to the storekeeper. "Toby, do you happen to have a spare piece of plywood lying around? It doesn't have to be real big, maybe a couple of feet long, and about a foot wide. One of the windows in the shed is broken, and I need to board it up until I can get the glass replaced."</p>
		<p>The storekeeper pursed his lips and pondered for a moment before smiling. "I've got just the thing," he declared, and headed back into the store. "Be right back." </p>
		<p>Within moments he came back, carrying a length of cream-colored board. "Will this do? It was left over from the fence I put up around Kate's vegetable garden."</p>
		<p>"This will do fine," Randi replied as she placed the board on the car seat, and closed the door. Walking arm-in-arm to the drivers' door, they stood for a moment, in awkward silence as the falling snow dotted their hair and clothing.</p>
		<p>"Well," Randi broke the silence. "I'd better get going. Tell Kate I'll see her soon" At the older man's cocked eyebrow, she added, "I promise!"</p>
		<p>"See that you do," the big man rumbled sternly. "I promised your Uncle Jake that I'd look after you?. Don't make me a liar."</p>
		<p>A bittersweet smile graced the tall woman's face at the mention of her uncles' name. "I won't, Uncle Toby," she reassured, as she settled in the vehicle.</p>
		<p>The storekeeper stood and watched as the taillights of the Jeep faded into the white curtain. His mind wandered back to the day he first laid eyes on her. </p>
		<p>Toby was on his knees re-stocking a shelf, when the ting-a-ling of the doorbell announced a visitor. The big man turned and saw his long-time friend, Jake Oakes holding open the door and encouraging an, as yet unseen, individual to enter. "Come on, Randi. There's someone I want you to meet." And then, she walked in. She was tall, even at the age of twelve, and so gangly, but even then, she was a beauty; and nearly the spitting image of the man next to her. Jake gently took her hand, and together they approached the storekeeper. </p>
		<p>"Toby Jenkins, I'd like you to meet Randi Christine Oakes?my niece." The elder Oakes announced.</p>
		<p>Toby held out his hand to the girl, who stood there in shy silence studying the floor. "A pleasure to meet you, young lady."</p>
		<p>She lifted her face to him, and Toby's heart lurched. Her silky, raven hair hung limply about her face. Her cheeks, which should have held the pink blush of youth, were pale and drawn, and lightly tracked with dried tears. And her eyes?lord; her eyes?such a beautiful, crystal-blue; and filled with so much sadness. She looked up at him, and Toby could tell she was somewhat intimidated by his size, but she gamely placed her hand in his big one. "Pleased to meet you, sir," she semi-whispered. From that moment on, the big man was hers.</p>
		<p>Toby would later learn that Randi's parents, Jake's brother and sister-in-law, were killed in an auto accident. Randi's mother had no living relatives and the authorities had misplaced Jake's address information. So a grieving Randi spent weeks being shuffled between courts and foster homes, lost and alone, until Jake's' address had been found. Jake and Randi barely knew each other, as Randi was a toddler the last time he saw her, but their mutual grief became the foundation for a bond that even most fathers and daughters never shared.</p>
		<p>Randi flourished under Jake's' care. Her outgoing personality and gentle, caring spirit made her the darling of Cutters Gap, and the center of Toby and Kate Jenkins' world.</p>
		<p>Now the center of their world was lost and alone again?for entirely different reasons. Only this time, there was no one that would come and rescue her. Jake had passed on years ago, from a massive heart attack, while the young woman was in her final year of medical school. Back then, she had a town full of friends and adopted family to see her through her heartache. Now, with this latest tragedy that befell her last year?well, the town was still here?but, in her grief and self perceived guilt, Randi had cut herself off from everyone that would help her through it. Toby knew in his heart, that if the gentle-hearted woman didn't end her self imposed exile soon, she would never come out of the well of despair she had fallen into.</p>
		<p>"We'll be here for you honey," he whispered to the falling snow. "Don't wait too long."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Randi breathed a huge sigh of relief as she traveled the snow-packed highway.
			<i>That wasn't so bad, </i>she half smiled to herself.
			<i>Thank you, Uncle Toby, for not pushing. I just need time. </i>Satisfied with her self-deception, the dark-haired Doctor's thoughts turned to a certain strawberry-blonde writer.
			<i>God, what a pill! The tall woman grimaced. Still?she had some lovely green eyes. Hell, she had a lovely
				<b>everything</b>. It's a pity. I'll bet when she's not being hateful, she's pretty darn nice to be around.
			</i> "Heh," Randi snorted. "Not that you'll ever get the chance to find out."
		</p>
		<p>The tall woman turned onto the road that led to her house and turned on the radio, hoping to hear the latest on the storm that was assaulting the area. Trisha Yearwood was belting out 'Ribbons and Bows.'
			<i>Ooohh, I love this song. </i> Randi leaned back and let her rich contralto voice accompany the country diva. Her voice trailed off, as she noticed bright beams of light branching across the road up ahead.
			<i>What the hell??</i>
		</p>
		<p>Randi wasn't sure what to expect, and slowed her approach accordingly, craning her neck and following the path of the lights back to their source. "Son of a bitch!" The tall woman exclaimed as her eyes fell upon the broken and dented mass of metal that used to be Megan's Lexus. Pulling her Jeep to the side of the road, Randi reached down and turned on the CB radio that hung below the dashboard. "Breaker, breaker?Cutters Gap Rescue, this is Randi Oakes. Come in please." She barked into the handmike. Hearing no immediate response, she tried again. "Breaker?Cutters Gap Rescue, please respond." Getting no response, the Doctor growled and threw open her door. She had one foot on the snowy ground when the radio crackled. </p>
		<p>
			<b>"Cutters Gap Rescue, responding. What's the problem Randi?" </b> Chet Masters' voice sounded a little harried.
		</p>
		<p>Randi grabbed up the Mic. "We've got a vehicle crash, Chet. About a mile and a half up my road. The driver's still in the car, and I'm on my way down to assist?but she's going to need transport ASAP." Getting no response, Randi tapped the button. "I need transport Chet, do you copy?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"No can do, Randi,"</b> the medic sighed.
			<b> I'm down here at old man Cuthbert's place. He and his car got real familiar with a tree. He doesn't look to be too bad, but we're having a bitch of a time prying him out of this hunk of scrap he calls a car. And this damn snow ain't making it any easier. Any way you can get the patient up to your place?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Shit, shit, shit! </i> "That's an affirmative, Chet?I'll find a way," she gritted as she dropped the Mic and climbed out of the cab.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Sorry, Randi. Keep me informed."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Yeah, right," the tall woman grumbled as she threw open the back door and reached for the snow broom and the 'First Response' First Aid Kit that her uncle always kept in the Jeep.</p>
		<p>Stumbling and sliding through the snowy brush, Randi made her way to the stout, aged Maple that cradled the silver Lexus in it's bosom. Impact with the tree had loosed the snow that clung to the branches above, effectively covering the vehicle in a pristine blanket.
			<i>Shit, if it hadn't been for the headlights, I would've never known it was here. </i>Setting the First Aid kit on a nearby stump, the tall woman quickly brushed the snow away from the door and part of the roof. Time was of the essence now, and she didn't need packed or falling snow to impede her efforts. Having cleared the door, she reached for the door handle and pulled?only to have the door open about an inch before locking in place. Randi cursed and pulled again?without success. The door was stuck. Grabbing the brush, she pushed more snow away from the bottom of the door, working her way back toward the front of the vehicle, and groaned in frustration when she saw the crumpled metal where the door meets the side panel. "Goddammit," she growled. "I don't need this right now."
		</p>
		<p>Dropping the brush, Randi straightened to full height and took a deep breath. "Getting mad isn't going to help," she reminded herself. "Just get the damned door open." With that, she planted one foot in the snow, one foot on the car body, and both hands on the doorframe, counted to three?and pulled. Sinewy muscles strained and pulled, as flesh battled metal; and with a long, dull groan, metal yielded. Pushing the door back as far as it would go, the Doctor peered into the dimly lit interior, and groaned.</p>
		<p>The blood-matted blonde head rested on the expended air bag that covered the steering wheel. Her limp body held in place by the shoulder harness. A blood caked arm hung limply between unnaturally twisted legs.
			<i> Jesus, </i> The first thing the tall woman did was recline the drivers' seat back a few inches, to give herself a little more room. Then, reaching in, Randi gently grasped Megan's head in her hands. "Megan, this is Dr. Oakes?can you hear me?" Receiving no response, Randi continued speaking aloud. "Still not talking to me, huh? That's okay. I need to check your breathing." Unwilling to remove her hands from their supporting positions; the doctor leaned in further, until her cheek was within an inch of the unconscious woman's lips. Almost immediately, she felt the warm breaths against her skin. "Well, you're breathing okay. Now I have to move you away from this wheel, so I can see how badly you're injured." Keeping the blonde head as straight as possible, Randi lifted her away from the steering wheel, and lay her back on the seat. Next, Randi needed to stabilize the neck. And as much as she hated to do it, she would have to release her hold and step away. "Okay Megan, I need to move away for a moment. I'll be right back." Releasing her hold and backing out of the car, Randi lunged for the First Aid kit.
			<i>Please god, let there be a collar in here. I can't remember the last time I've looked in here. </i> Placing the suitcase-type kit on the ground, she unsnapped the latches and laid it open, doing a quick visual inventory.
			<i>Thank you! </i> Grabbing up the stiff, molded collar, she reached back in the vehicle and carefully fastened it around the writer's neck.
		</p>
		<p>With the most critical task completed, the raven-haired doctor began a swift inventory of the small woman's injuries. The physician worked quickly and efficiently, verbalizing her actions, in the off chance that the unresponsive woman could hear and feel what was happening. "Your pulse is pretty fast, Megan, but that's 'cause you've lost some blood. You're breathing kind of fast too, but that's to be expected. I'm going to open your eye and shine a light in there for just a moment, okay?" Shining the penlight in the young woman's eyes, the dark haired woman noted a sluggish reaction from the pupils. "Hmmm, looks like you may have a concussion too. Don't worry, we'll take care of it."</p>
		<p>The one-way conversation continued as the tall doctor pressed, probed, and examined as much of the limp body as she could reach; applying temporary dressings and bandages as she went along.</p>
		<p>A long twenty minutes had passed before Randi was finished with examination and treatment. She stood outside the damaged vehicle, pondering her next course of action. The snow was getting deeper and Megan's chances of becoming hypothermic increased with every passing moment, in spite of the rescue blanket that Randi had covered her with.
			<i>Now what," </i>her mind screamed.
			<i>No backboard, no stretcher,
				<b>nothing</b> to immobilize her with, so I can get her up to the house?DAMMIT!
			</i> Running a frustrated hand through her hair, the desperate doctor searched her mind for an answer. Looking up at her Jeep, and down at her patient, Randi decided on a course of action. It was risky, at best, but it was the only chance the younger woman would have.
		</p>
		<p>Scrambling up to the Jeep, Randi grabbed the piece of board that Toby had given her earlier, and carried it back to the Lexus. She then grabbed the remaining roll bandage and elastic bandage; sliding the board down and behind Megan's head, Randi used the remaining bandaging to secure the blonde's head and upper torso to the board.</p>
		<p>Randi sighed as she looked down at the tightly wrapped writer lying in the car. This solution was about as far from perfect as she could get; and risky as hell for the patient, but it was the best she could come up with. Now she would have to get the injured woman out of her car, and into the Jeep that waited for her at the top of the incline, about twenty yards away.
			<i> Thank god, this didn't happen further up the hill, where the woods
				<b>really</b> drop down from the road.
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>"All right, Ms. Megan, I have to get you up to my truck. And in order to do that, I'm going to have to move you out of the car, and on to the ground for a moment. Now I'm going to have the thermal blanket under you, but you'll still feel a few moments of cold; but it'll be over quick, so don't worry." The tall woman bent to her task, but paused, as she remembered something. With a muttered curse, she ran back to the Jeep, whipped open the passenger door, and laid the seat back to a nearly prone position.
			<i>That'll make things a little easier when we get up here. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Back at the wreck, Randi placed the blanket beside the car and began the arduous process of removing the unconscious woman from the vehicle, and repositioning her for easier pickup. Having done this, the dark haired physician squatted down, and carefully gathered the smaller woman in her arms.
			<i>God, she's so light. </i> Shaking off the thought, the tall woman made her way up to the Jeep with her helpless burden.
		</p>
		<p>It was slow, awkward, and more than a little frustrating, but Randi finally had the writer tucked into the passenger seat of the Jeep. The motor was running, the heater was on, the patient was firmly strapped in. The only thing left for the weary physician to do was gather up the remains of the First Aid kit.</p>
		<p>Short moment's later; fingers nearly numb from the cold, shifted the Jeep into drive and headed home.</p>
