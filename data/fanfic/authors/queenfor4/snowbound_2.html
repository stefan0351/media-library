<!-- Snowbound \ Chapter Two -->

<p>"Shit, shit, shit!"</p>
		<p>Megan Galagher was lost. And she was not happy. What was supposed to be a 'scenic' route back to her native New York from a book signing in Manchester, NH was turning out to be the road trip from Hell. The attendant at the last gas station she stopped at '30 miles back' promised her that this road would lead her to the interstate within 20 miles.
			<i>Obviously he didn't know what in the Hell he was talking about.</i> She fumed to herself.
			<i>Now here I am, driving down this narrow-assed road, around a mountain that looks like it's about to go avalanche any minute, with no clue where I'm going, and no friggin' interstate signs in sight. AARRGGHHH!</i>
		</p>
		<p>She spotted a sign that read Cutters Gap 3MI and breathed a sigh of relief.
			<i>Thank you, God. Maybe they can give me some kind of clue how I can get to the interstate, or at least have a phone I can use to call the auto club and get directions and then, call my agent and let her know I'm still alive. My cell phone has been useless in these damn mountains. </i>Breathing a little easier, she pressed a little harder on the accelerator of her Lexus and headed into Cutters Gap.

		<p>Randi navigated the winding road with a rumbling dread in her belly. She had driven this road, with its many sharp curves and 45 degree inclines, hundreds of times in the years she had lived here. The private road that led to and from her hilltop ranch was mostly treelined, but there were spots where the edge of the road dropped into little ravines, and if you weren't careful, you would find yourself losing the road and tumbling into the ravine. However the tall woman's dread had less to do with the road than it had to do with the trip into Cutters Gap. The people there were her friends, they had known the tall woman most of her life, but they knew. They knew of her shame. And after all this time she still saw the sympathetic looks, listened to the well-meaning advice to move on with her life. But she couldn't forget, couldn't move on, and couldn't bear the sympathy that she felt she did not deserve. So she became a recluse. Living a solitary life in her house high up on a hill that more closely resembled a mountain. Only venturing into town when she absolutely needed supplies.
			<i>I can do this,</i> she promised herself.
			<i>Get in quick; get out quick, no problem.</i> "Then why do I feel like I'm about to step into an alligator pit?" She said aloud to no one in particular.

		<p>Megan drove her Lexus ES300 down the middle of a street that looked like a throwback to the 50s. Small shops lined one side of the street, and 'professional' buildings lined the other, with diagonal parking on both sides. The young strawberry blond eyed the passing storefronts, searching in vain for something familiar.
			<i>Jesus, no malls, no department stores, no Starbucks, not even a 'McDonald's. What part of the twilight zone have I wandered into? I don't even see a friggin payphone! </i>Driving on, and ignoring the curious looks from people, Megan's hopes were dwindling.
			<i>A gas station...I'll settle for a damn gas station. </i>As if in answer to her plea, the writer spotted a row of cheerful green gas pumps at the edge of town. Set well behind the pumps was what appeared, to Megan's grateful eyes, to be a rather expansive convenience store. The large sign above the entrance read simply: TOBY'S GAS & GROCERY. "Thank you, Lord!" Megan sighed.
			<i>Maybe I can at least grab something to munch on and use their phone. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Looking around as she pulled on the lot, Megan spotted the familiar blue and white booth. Pulling into a parking space set between the store entrance and the phone, Megan gathered up her dayplanner and exited the car. Pausing outside the auto, the petite author breathed deeply of the crisp cold air and took a moment to look around. As much as she hated being lost in the middle of nowhere, she couldn't help but admire the rustic feel of the small town and the beauty of the surrounding hilly woods, lush with snowcapped pines. Looking up, Megan decided she really didn't like the looks of the rapidly graying sky.
			<i>All right Meg, sightsee later; take care of business now. </i>Moving to the phone, Megan pulled her calling card out of the dayplanner and picked up the handset.
