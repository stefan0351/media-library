<!-- Snowbound \ Chapter Ten -->

<p>"Rise and shine, Ms. Galagher. A bright, new day beckons!" the brunette announced cheerfully, as she strode into the room carrying a large tray. It was a cheeriness that was decidedly unappreciated by the woman in the bed.</p>
		<p>"I've no intention of rising
			<b>or</b> shining," the blonde grumbled as she reached for the blanket with her good hand, "and the 'bright, new day can kiss my dull, old?" The last word was muffled by the blanket that the small woman threw over her face.
		</p>
		<p>Randi was hard-pressed to contain a chuckle at the unknowing cuteness of that act. Setting the tray on the dresser, she walked over to the bed and squatted down by the bunched up blanket that had blond hairs sticking out.</p>
		<p>"Aw, c'mon now," the brunette cajoled, "surely you don't want to miss out on some nice, hot, fluffy scrambled eggs." The doctor grinned to herself as she watched the blanket creep down, revealing a bleary green eye.</p>
		<p>"A thick slice of tender, juicy ham." The blanket moved down further.</p>
		<p>"Fresh, hot, buttered sourdough bread." The blanket moved down even further, revealing two wide-open green eyes, and a pert nose.</p>
		<p>"Scrambled eggs?" a muffled voice inquired hopefully. The tall woman nodded.</p>
		<p>"Ham?" Another nod.</p>
		<p>"Hot bread and real butter?" A smile and a nod.</p>
		<p>The green eyes narrowed. "This had better not be a trick to get me up, so you can poke and prod."</p>
		<p>Randi feigned a shocked expression. "Me?"?. Never!"</p>
		<p>A snort was the response as the blonde drew down the covers and sighed. "Okay, what do I have to endure in order to eat?"</p>
		<p>"Well," the doctor responded as she stood up, "we have to do the usual checks, check and change your bandages, and you probably have to use the pan, but?." She paused at the crestfallen expression on the young woman's face. "Why don't we let you eat first, so your breakfast doesn't get cold." Randi was rewarded with the first genuine, open smile she had seen since meeting the writer. And it warmed her immeasurably. The tall woman decided, as she helped her patient sit up, that some way?somehow?she would see more of those smiles.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Mmmm," the blonde hummed delightedly, as the slightly cheddary flavor of the eggs caressed her palate. This was the first truly solid food she'd had in days. And, while the broth and soups she had been given were good, her stomach was getting really pissed at not being given regular food. Now, as she sat munching contentedly, she would swear she could hear her tummy chanting a litany of 'thank yous'.
			<i>God, who knew she could cook like this? </i> the writer mused as she speared a piece of pre-cut ham.
			<i>Actually, she does a lot of things good; you just refuse to see it, </i>her small voice reprimanded.
			<i>
				<b>"Don't start!"</b>
			</i> she warned the small voice.
			<i>She's only doing this because she has to. Keep telling yourself that, </i> the small voice sneered. Trying to quiet her conflicting thoughts, the writer's mind drifted back to the night before.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Grayson,"</b> the gravelly voice barked into the phone.
		</p>
		<p>"Don't you ever just say 'hello'?" the amused blonde inquired.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Galagher?!"</b> the publisher shouted.
			<b>"Is that you? Jesus Christ, woman, where are you? Are you all right? I've been worried sick about you!" Where in the hell have you been? "</b>The older woman ranted, clearly pissed, but near tears in relief at hearing her young friend's voice.
		</p>
		<p>"I'm uh, I'm okay, Charly." The blonde was clearly struggling to keep from breaking down. But it was so hard. She was so scared?and so alone?and the familiar, caring voice threatened to destroy what little control of her emotions she had left. "I was in an accident." At the quick intake of breath on the other end, the writer hastily reassured, "But I really am okay. I've got a broken arm, and a broken leg, and a mild concussion, but that's all."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"That's all!? Goddamn it, Megan, that's enough!"</b> the distraught publisher bellowed.
			<b>"What? hospital are you in? What room? Who's your doctor?" </b> The older woman was rattling off questions faster than the bemused author could answer them. Before she could respond, she heard footsteps coming down the hall and stopping at her door, followed by a light tapping.
		</p>
		<p>"Hold on a moment, Charly," the blonde instructed before laying the phone down and bidding Randi to enter.</p>
		<p>The tall woman strode into the room with an apologetic grin. "Sorry to bother you," she offered, "but I figured you might want these." She handed over a sheet of paper, accompanied by a legal-looking document and two laminated cards. Megan briefly examined the items in her hand. The sheet of paper contained, in neatly typed order, Randi's full name, address, phone number, vehicle make and license number. The document was her medical certification, and the laminated cards were her driver's license and hospital ID badge. At the blonde's questioning look, the doctor explained, "These are the things I would need to know, if my friend were injured and in a stranger's hands." And, with a gentle smile, the tall woman left the room, leaving the young woman thoroughly flabbergasted by the wisdom, and unexpected kindness of that act. Megan was brought out of her consternation by a muffled shout, as she hastily picked up the phone.</p>
		<p>"Sorry about that," the blonde apologized.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Who was that?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"That was just the doctor."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Is everything okay?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Everything's fine, Charly. She was just dropping off a couple of things. Now, as to your questions, I'm not exactly in a hospital."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Whoa," </b>the older woman interrupted,
			<b>"what do you mean 'not exactly in a hospital? You just said that was a doctor in the room. What the hell's going on, Meg?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"I'll be happy to tell you, sweety, if you'll quit interrupting," the young woman chuckled, earning her an impatient growl. Once the older woman quieted down, the writer filled her in on the events leading up to the present conversation. The publisher's reaction was a long silence, before inadvertently putting her foot in her mouth.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Whoo, talk about sleeping with the enemy,"</b> the older woman blurted, then quickly clapped her hand over her mouth in belated recognition of the ill chosen words.
		</p>
		<p>"That wasn't even close to funny," the icy voice responded.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"You're right, Megan. That was an extremely poor choice of words,"</b> the publisher apologized, mentally kicking herself.
			<b>"I'm really sorry."</b>
		</p>
		<p>The writer chewed on her lip for a long moment before sighing; "it's all right, Charlie. I just?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"I know, baby,"</b> the older woman responded maternally.
			<b>"But really, personal bias aside, is she treating you okay?</b>
		</p>
		<p>"I suppose," the younger woman allowed. "What choice does she have?"</p>
		<p>The older woman frowned in puzzlement.
			<b> "What do you mean?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"I won't be trapped here forever, Charlie. She knows that. She's taking care of me so I don't have her ass thrown in jail when I get back." The writer paused as an evil thought brought a catty smile to her lips. "Of course, with what goes on in those places, she might feel right at home."</p>
		<p>The publisher dropped her head and scrubbed her eyebrows with the fingers of her free hand.
			<b>
				<i> "Oh, Megan." </i> "Honey, if she were really worried about you having her arrested, don't you think it would have been easier to just leave you in your car?"
			</b>
		</p>
		<p>"She's a pervert, not a murderer," the younger woman huffed.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Thank you for clearing that up for me," </b>the publisher chuckled, amused at the petulant distinction.
			<b>"Seriously, Meg, I would like to find out a little more about this doctor; can you ask her for her full name and perhaps her address? I'd feel a lot better if I knew a little bit more about her and her medical credentials. I've got a few friends in the medical field who can provide me with the information I need."</b>
		</p>
		<p>The blonde glanced at the papers in her hand and smirked. "Got a pen?"</p>
		<p>The older woman gazed at the wealth of information that she had written down in front of her.
			<b>
				<i> "Jeezus, this is damn-near everything but the color of her underwear." </i>
			</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Um, just out of curiosity, how did you get your hands on all this information?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Do you remember when she stopped in here earlier?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Yeah."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"That's when she just handed me all this stuff. Her hospital ID, driver's license, AMA certificate and personal info. I asked her why, and she just said something like, she'd want to know this stuff if she were you."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Well, that was certainly nice of her,"</b> the publisher commented, duly impressed by the doctor's proactive response.
		</p>
		<p>"If you say so," the younger woman shrugged.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Megan, honey, from the sound of things, you're going to be there awhile. How pleasant or unpleasant your stay will be is going to depend on you as much as her. Now, it really looks like she is trying to do right by you." Hearing the indignant snort on the other end, the older woman rushed on. "Look, I know how you feel about gays, lesbians in particular, but I also know that you are an extremely fair and level-headed young woman. I'm not asking you to become best buddies with her, or start putting rainbow stickers on your car. All I'm asking you to do is try looking at her as a person, and not as a symbol. Accept the help she's trying to offer, gracefully. And when the road clears enough for you to get out of there and come home, you won't ever have to see her again."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"It's hard," the young woman responded, her voice cracking, "I look at Dr. Oakes, and I think of 'her'. She wanted me to think she cared for me too, but she didn't. If she did, she never would have left." The young woman's voice was a bare whisper now, and the publisher had to struggle to hear her. "She never called, she never wrote. She had her 'girlfriend'; she didn't need me or daddy anymore."</p>
		<p>The publisher's heart hurt at the pain in those whispered words.
			<b>"Oh, honey, I know. But this woman isn't your mother. She's just a young woman that came to your rescue and, in spite of your differences, is trying to take care of you. Let her out of your mother's shadow, and I promise you, your 'forced vacation' won't be half so bad."</b>
		</p>
		<p>The writer bit her lip and sighed deeply. "I'll try, Charlie."</p>
		<p>Now, in the cold, clear light of day, she wasn't sure she could do as her friend asked. It was good advice, to be sure. But the writer wasn't sure she could look past the tall woman's lifestyle and see the person underneath. Especially since that lifestyle was responsible for the years of pain and feelings of abandonment that she had endured. Megan's introspection was interrupted by a soft knocking on the door.</p>
		<p>"Come."</p>
		<p>A sable-crowned head peeked in the door, wearing a toothy grin. "All done?"</p>
		<p>The writer looked down at her tray, which was cleared of everything but random crumbs.
			<i>I ate all that!? God, I must have been hungry. </i>She looked back to the expectant face at the door;
			<i>you can do this, Meg. </i> "Yes. Thank you."
		</p>
		<p>The lanky physician opened the door wide and walked in, carrying her necessary medical items, and something else that Megan couldn't see, because it was mostly shielded by the woman's body. Placing the unknown item in the deep chair, and the other items on the small table, the doctor approached the bed.</p>
		<p>"Breakfast was okay?" The doctor inquired, as she removed the tray to the dresser.</p>
		<p>"Very good, thank you."</p>
		<p>"You're quite welcome," the doctor responded with a warm smile that the young woman found hard not to return. "Okay, we've got breakfast done," she announced as she returned to the bed. "Now we have to do a check and change, and you, I'm sure, have to answer nature's call. Again, Ms. Galagher, the choice is yours. What would you prefer to do next?"</p>
		<p> Megan again searched the tall woman's face, searching for something?anything?that would reveal the insincerity she was sure the doctor possessed. But all she found was an open and honest warmth that, on some deep level, shamed the young woman. "I, uhm, I really have to go," the writer responded.</p>
		<p> "No problem," the doctor reassured, as she moved to the closet for the items she would need.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Charlotte Grayson picked up her private line for the tenth time. And for the tenth time, she paused.
			<i>She would kill you if she found out, </i> her head shouted. But she's worried sick, the heart argued.
			<i>It's not going to kill you to let her know that everything's all right. You don't have to write her a book. Just give her the basics and ease her mind. She deserves that much. </i> "Arrghh, I hate this!" the publisher growled, as she dialed the memorized number. She listened to one-and-a-half rings before the other end picked up. "She's all right," the publisher announced briskly. "She wrecked in the snow up there, and broke an arm and leg, but she's being taken care of." The older woman listened for a moment, then resumed speaking. "No, she's not in a hospital. The woman that found her is a retired doctor who lives up the road from where she crashed. The ambulance was tied up, and the roads were too bad to try and get to the hospital, so the doctor brought her to her home. The downside is that they are snowbound. It'll be weeks before she can get out of there." Charlie listened to the voice on the other end for a moment, and with a mirthless chuckle responded, "It's a downside because the good doctor just happens to be gay." The silence on the other end was long and deafening before the publisher heard a muffled sob. "Look?she'll be all right," the editor consoled. "This may be the best thing that could have happened to her. This may force her to look at things through eyes that have been closed for years. Yes?..I'll keep you informed." With that uttered assurance, Charlotte Grayson hung up the phone.
			<i>Forgive me, Megan. </i>
