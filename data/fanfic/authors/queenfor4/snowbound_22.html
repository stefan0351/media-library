<!-- Snowbound \ Chapter Twenty-Two -->

<p>Megan sat in her chair, idly running her finger across the surface of the small, three-by-five inch Rolodex card, studying the address printed in Charly's bold, distinct style.</p>
		<p>Laura Holloway</p>
		<p>712 East Lancaster Street</p>
		<p>Conaway, NY 14102</p>
		<p>Tel: (716) 555-1202</p>
		<p> "Charly?"</p>
		<p>"Hmm?"</p>
		<p>"How long have you known - about her - about this?"</p>
		<p>Charly looked into the green eyes that studied her intently.
			<i>Oy! </i> She cleared her throat.
		</p>
		<p>"Almost three years. She contacted me shortly after your first book came out. Knowing of your history with her, and your feelings about her, I was reluctant to talk to her at first. But she was persistent, and finally I agreed to meet her for lunch one day. We talked for a very long time as she told me of her repeated attempts - and failures - to contact you. Like you, I didn't believe her at first.But she showed me a few things that supported her story, chief among them being her letters to you."</p>
		<p>The older woman shrugged nonchalantly. "She made a believer out of me."</p>
		<p>Hurt green eyes regarded the older woman. "Why did you wait til now to tell me? Why didn't you tell me back then?"</p>
		<p>The publisher met the hurt gaze with equanimity. "Were you ready to hear it back then? How far past 'I've talked to your mother' would I have gotten before you went ballistic and walked out of that door, never to return?"</p>
		<p>Whatever posture the young woman had disappeared as the truth of the publisher's statement hit home, and she slumped miserably in her chair. And Charly's heart went out to her once again.</p>
		<p>"But it was more than that, Meg," the publisher continued. "Your mother didn't want me to tell you. She said that you made your position quite clear at your father's funeral and, as much as it hurt, she would abide by that."</p>
		<p>Megan flushed guiltily at the memory of her actions at her father's funeral.
			<i>I wouldn't want to be with me after that, either. </i>But one question nagged at her.
		</p>
		<p>"Okay, I can understand her logic there," the blonde conceded warily, an ugly suspicion rearing it's head. "But if she didn't want to reconcile, what did she want?"</p>
		<p>Charly grinned as she expertly read the blonde's expression. "Yeah, I wondered about that too. And I asked her pretty much the same question." The older woman's gaze grew distant for a moment, and her smile became bittersweet. "To this day I remember the hurt in her eyes and the exact words of her reply. She just said, 'I don't want anything. I just want someone to talk to every now and then. Someone who can tell me how she's doing, what she's doing?if she's happy. I just need to know that she's okay.'" The publisher gave a helpless shrug. "How could I really say no to that, Meg?"</p>
		<p>The writer nodded absently, studying the card, thinking.</p>
		<p>Finally, she looked up. "I can keep these?" indicating the card and letter.</p>
		<p>"Of course."</p>
		<p>Placing the items in her purse, she rose from her chair. "You've given me a lot to think about, Charly. Thank you." With that she turned to leave.</p>
		<p>"You'll talk to her?" the older woman persisted.</p>
		<p>"We'll see," she answered with a small smile, then quickly raised her hand to forestall the protest that the older woman was preparing to offer. "Please, Charly. You've given me a lot to take in here. Give me some time to wrap my mind around it. Okay?"</p>
		<p>"All right," the publisher sighed, acknowledging the turmoil her friend must surely be feeling right now. "But will you call me soon?" the older woman pleaded. "
			<b>I</b> need to know that you're okay too."
		</p>
		<p>"I will, Charly. I promise," she returned with a sincere smile, then turned and left.</p>
		<p>"Dear lord," the publisher mumbled as she ran both hands through her hair. "Please let me have done the right thing here."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Megan sat out on her balcony, watching the pink blush of dawn emerge from it's midnight womb. Sleep would have been a futile pursuit, so she hadn't bothered trying. She had too much on her mind. Charly had indeed given her a great deal to think about, but, to be fair, she had given her hope too.</p>
		<p>Hope perhaps, but not courage. Not enough courage to finish dialing the numbers to Randi's house.</p>
		<p>No matter how many times she picked up the phone and tried.</p>
		<p>She didn't even try to call her mother's house. No, that would have to be done in person.</p>
		<p>If she did it at all.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Can I do this? Can I afford not to? Is Charly right? Am I so comfortable in my enmity toward her that I'm willing to let it continue, knowing that it may be unfounded? Jesus, why am I even thinking about this? I've been pissed for years and blaming her for it. Hurting because I thought she didn't love me. And now I have a chance to lose that hurt, and I have to think about it? Bullshit! Grow up, Megan. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Her mind made up, Megan rose from her chair and headed toward her room.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>
			<i>Okay?708, 710, 712. Oh, God. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Megan cruised slowly down the picturesque, tree-lined street and pulled quickly to the curb when she spotted the large, elegantly curved numbers she was looking for above the door. It was a small, single-level home. Now she sat staring at the neatly manicured lawn, overlooked by a large picture window that was framed on either side with tall, wide rose bushes, currently enjoying their long, winter slumber.
			<i>C'mon, Meg, you can do this. You didn't drive three hours outside the city just to chicken out now, </i>her little Charly voice chastised. "I'm not chickening out," the blonde protested aloud. "I'm just?preparing," she finished lamely.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Uh-huh, </i> little Charly drawled skeptically.
			<i>Get out there?chicken! </i>
		</p>
		<p>Heaving a resigned sigh, the writer opened the car door and exited. Closing the door, she stood beside the vehicle and breathed deeply of the crisp, cold air and noted absently the clean, dry streets.
			<i>Thank God it's only been cold in these parts so far. I don't think I want to see any more snow again for quite a while. </i>
		</p>
		<p>And she felt her heart clench at the memory of blue eyes and raven hair.</p>
		<p>Tucking that image away for another time, she strode resolutely across the street and up the short cement walkway.</p>
		<p>Standing in front of the door, the writer paused, praying desperately for the rioting butterflies in her belly to lose some steam.</p>
		<p>Finally, a trembling finger pressed the doorbell button.</p>
		<p>The writer held her breath as the door opened to reveal a smiling, petite, auburn-haired woman about the same height as herself.</p>
		<p>And watched as the smile faded, as pink cheeks became drained of all color, and bright, hazel eyes quickly filled.</p>
		<p>"Meggie?" A hoarse, ragged whisper.</p>
		<p>"Hello, Mother."</p>
		<p>Megan had pictured several different scenarios for this moment, but none of them required her to lunge across the doorway and catch her mother before she hit the floor.</p>
		<p>However, that was exactly what happened, as Laura Holloway's knees turned to gelatin.</p>
		<p>Megan yelped a startled "No" as she leaped across the doorway and caught the swooning woman in her arms, gently easing her down to the floor.
			<i>Great going, lamebrain. Make her die from a heart attack before you get the first chance to talk to her. </i>
		</p>
		<p>The writer's self-chastisement was cut short by the panicked yell from behind her.</p>
		<p>"Laura!"</p>
		<p>Megan swiveled her head just in time to see the solid, well-proportioned body of the tai chi master slide to her knees beside them. Dark blue eyes widened in recognition before darting down to the dazed figure of her lover. Assuring herself that her lover was okay, Caitlin looked back to the still kneeling blonde.</p>
		<p>"Megan," her greeting was cordial, but wary.</p>
		<p>
			<i>You think I'm going to hurt her again, don't you? </i> "Hello, Cait," the blonde smiled gently. "Will you help me get her up to the couch?"
		</p>
		<p>Caitlin gave a small nod, and both women lifted the dazed woman and led her to the couch.</p>
		<p>Once Laura was seated, Caitlin backed off to observe mother and daughter.</p>
		<p>Megan sat next to her mother, her hand held in a vise-like grip as watery eyes devoured every inch of her face, as if trying to convince herself that her child was really there.</p>
		<p>Megan looked deeply into beautiful hazel eyes that she thought she would never see again, and saw every bit of the pain and loneliness she had experienced over the years reflected in those blue-green depths.
			<i>God help me, she
				<b>did</b> care!
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>Megan felt her own eyes burn and begin to fill as she reached a trembling hand to cup a pale cheek.</p>
		<p>"Let's try this again," she smiled tenderly, her voice cracking. "Hello, Mother."</p>
		<p>And found her arms filled with a sobbing, warm, soft body that she missed terribly for so many years.</p>
		<p>Tears ran unbidden down the blonde's face as she held tightly to the weeping woman. Megan chanced to look over at the intense, dark eyes of her mother's mate,</p>
		<p>And was surprised to see that they too glistened.</p>
		<p>Royal blue met tearful green for a long moment before Caitlin offered a sincere smile and small nod before silently exiting the room.</p>
		<p>And a large, lonely piece of the small writer's heart finally found its way home.</p>
