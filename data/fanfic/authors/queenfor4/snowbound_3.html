<!-- Snowbound \ Chapter Three -->

<p>Charlotte Grayson was doing her best not to burst into flames as she patiently explained, once again, to the young writer on the phone that she could not provide him with a young woman so that he might perform some 'research' for the romance story he was working on.
			<i>God help me! What ever happened to 'cruising the bars' for a date?</i> The yodeling of her private phone interrupted her reverie.
			<i>Thank God!</i> "Look, Johnny, I've got an important call coming in. I can't help you with your 'research', you're gonna have to get a gal the old fashioned way; hit the bars." Disconnecting quickly, she grabbed her other phone, "Grayson" she barked.
		</p>
		<p>"What ever happened to 'hello'?" the chiding voice on the other end inquired.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Galagher!" </b>The redhead bellowed.
			<b> "Where on Gaia's green earth are you? I've been worried sick, you little shit. I haven't heard from you since you left Manchester. Your cell phone keeps telling me the party I'm trying to call is unavailable, and the weatherman's been damn near peeing himself over a major storm front that's coming through New Hampshire and Vermont on its way here. And we won't mention the book signing you're scheduled for at Barnes & Noble next week." </b> The exasperated woman finished, finally drawing a breath.
		</p>
		<p>"I'm fine Charly, thanks for asking." The strawberry blond chuckled into the phone. "First off, I'm about one hundred miles outside of Manchester, in a town called Cutters Gap. I'm surrounded by mountains, which is why you can't reach me on the cell phone. I got a little lost while looking for the interstate, so I stopped here to use their phone to call you and then call the auto club to get some dependable directions to the interstate. Yes, I've noticed the weather is looking a bit nasty, but I should be able to get directions, grab something to eat and be well on the highway before the snow hits. Does that about cover everything?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Yeah, well," </b>the publisher replied, somewhat appeased,
			<b> "you should have called me sooner. I was worried...I mean, I can't have my star writing talent gallivanting around the countryside and missing her appointments." </b>
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Megan smiled at the publisher's weak attempt at disguising her concern. "I love you too, Charly." The writer chuckled. "But I'm okay, and I'll be home soon. How's Eric doing?" Megan inquired about her live-in boyfriend, causing the red-haired publisher to grimace and snort. </p>
		<p>
			<b>"Oh, he's missing you terribly, Meg; he only goes out on the town four nights a week instead of five,"</b> she answered with no small amount of sarcasm.
		</p>
		<p>Megan rolled her eyes. She was well aware of her publishing friend's dislike of her live-in lover. "Be nice, Charly. He's probably just lonely. I don't expect him to cloister himself in the apartment until I come home." She chided her friend. </p>
		<p>
			<b>"Whatever you say,"</b> the publisher grumbled.
		</p>
		<p>There was a pregnant silence before the petite blond said, "Look Charly, I've got to go. I want to grab something to eat and get directions before the snow starts falling. I'll call you when I get clear of these mountains." </p>
		<p>
			<b>"Sure thing Meg,"</b> the redhead replied.
			<b>"You be careful."</b>
		</p>
		<p>Megan hung up the phone and pulled her auto club card out and dialed the tollfree number.</p>

		<p>Charlotte Grayson sighed heavily as she stared at the now silent phone. She worried about the young writer, perhaps unnecessarily as Megan often chided her, but she worried anyway. Megan Galagher had come a long way in the three years since Charlotte first saw one of the young woman's stories in an independent women's magazine. The publishing editor recognized the raw talent in that short tale and quickly sought out the author. They met for lunch in one of Manhattan's many small delis and Megan allowed her to read a rough manuscript featuring a beautiful, brainy, and deadly private investigator called Samantha Steele. And the rest, as they say, was history. The deadly detective became the heroine in several best selling mysteries, and Megan, the golden child of the book world. The older woman became her agent, friend, confidante, and surrogate mother. The last being a role that Charlotte would have gladly relinquished to the real thing, but Megan would have none of it. The friendship between the women was comfortable. Despite the twenty-year difference in their ages, they shared many of the same interests and saw eye-to-eye on almost everything.... Except Eric. Charlotte had not trusted the handsome, arrogant, and decidedly smooth young blond since she first laid eyes on him. The young man had simply appeared at one of Megan's' book signings bearing a red rose and exuding a hefty amount of humble charm. Megan fell for it hook, line, and sinker. And in no time at all, the unemployed drifter went from staying with friends to living in a New York high-rise, driving his own SUV, and sampling New York night life with a beautiful young author on his arm. Charlotte never hid her dislike or distrust of Megan's companion, but the writer steadfastly defended him, saying the older woman simply did not understand. In this one area, both women simply agreed to disagree. Before Megan left for her most recent book signing, the publisher hoped that he would go with her. He might be useless, but he would at least be company for her. </p>
		<p>Lover boy declined though, pleading carsickness on long trips. Now Megan was lost and alone, and in spite of the writer's upbeat attitude, Charlotte had a bad feeling.</p>
