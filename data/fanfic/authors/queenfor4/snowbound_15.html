<!-- Snowbound \ Chapter Fifteen -->

<p>Randi padded into the kitchen humming to herself and feeling invigorated after her shower. Pulling the bread from the cabinet, she paused.
			<i>I should bring her in here and find out what kind of sandwich she'd like. </i> Having made that decision she put down the bread and exited the kitchen; stopping dead in her tracks when she heard muffled sobbing.
			<i>Megan?? Shit! </i> With her heart in her throat she scrambled into the livingroom and dropped to her knees beside the sobbing woman. "Megan, what's wrong? Are you sick? Is something hurting? The doctor fired off the questions while doing a rapid visual inspection. The only response she received to her questions was a quick headshake as the woman continued to cry.
		</p>
		<p>With a low growl, the doctor allowed her heart to overrule her caution as she removed the armrest from the chair and slid her arms underneath and behind the small woman and, being careful of the injured limbs, lifted her out of the chair. In one smooth motion, she sat back on her behind and lowered the smaller woman onto her lap. Wrapping long arms around the quivering frame, she murmured soft reassurances.</p>
		<p>Quickly overcoming her surprise at the doctor's actions, the heartsick woman accepted the comfort that was being offered and burrowed deeply into the warm softness. Whatever emotional walls she had left came tumbling down as a bitter, confused and lonely young woman convulsed in sobs; repeating two words over and over again, like a mantra. "So alone. So alone. So alone."</p>
		<p>Randi felt her own heart breaking as she held the quivering body tightly. "It's okay," she crooned, "you're not alone. I'm here. I've got you."</p>
		<p>
			<i>I'm here, Megan. And I'll be here for you as long as you need me. </i>
		</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>The dwindling remains of daylight cast silvered shadows throughout the room, and gently highlighted the huddled figures on the floor. The smaller woman lay limply against the larger body; having cried herself into a state of near exhaustion. The larger woman sat placidly with her head lolling back on the cushions of the couch she was leaning against. Her arms, though loose in their grip, still surrounded the young woman; continuing to offer what comfort they could.</p>
		<p>Finally marshaling her strength, the writer lifted her head and drew back some from her warm haven; looking up into liquid blue eyes that radiated so much caring and concern that it almost made her break into tears again.</p>
		<p>"I'm, uh?I'm sorry," the blonde rasped, "I don't?I couldn't ?"</p>
		<p>"Don't," Randi gently interrupted her. "You have nothing to apologize for. You've been through a great deal these past five weeks. You've had to deal with the pain of your injuries, the fear and uncertainty of being trapped and helpless in an unfamiliar environment. You've been forced to co-exist with, and submit to, an individual who represents everything you detest." Alert green eyes caught the flash of hurt accompanying that statement before Randi concealed it and continued. "And to top it all off, you've had to go through all this alone; without family or even a friend who could hold your hand and tell you it's gonna be okay. Considering all that," Randi tenderly brushed a lock of hair away from watery green eyes and smiled, "a good, heavy crying jag is nothing. You're a good, brave, strong woman, Megan Galagher, and, circumstances aside, I'm glad I got to know you."</p>
		<p>
			<i>Oh, god. </i> The blonde buried her face in the warm hollow of the doctor's collarbone; no longer able to face that sweet smile and warm, caring eyes. "Thank you," she mumbled from her hiding place. Then gathering her courage and raising her head, she reconnected with those blue orbs. "Thank you, Randi, for so?many things. Thank you for rescuing me. Thank you for healing me. Thank you for giving me your best when all I gave you was grief." There was a long, thoughtful pause, then she added, "Thank you for being better than me."
		</p>
		<p>Randi's attempt to dispute the last statement was cut short by three fingers that gently covered her lips. A golden head cocked slightly and full lips offered just a hint of a smile.
			<i>You know I'm right, Randi. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Finally, blue eyes blinked in acknowledgment and a single, grateful tear slid down a beautifully sculpted cheek.</p>
		<p>Megan smiled and, with some regret, removed her fingers from the wonderfully soft lips. Feeling that both of them needed to regroup from the intensity of the last hour, the blonde took a deep breath and grinned sheepishly.</p>
		<p>"I don't know about you, but I'm famished."</p>
		<p>Randi smiled, knowing this was a thinly disguised attempt to allow both of them some 'breathing room'. "Come to think of it, I am too." Taking their current positions into account, the tall woman gave a few moments' thought, and came up with a plan. "Okay, I need to get up and, in order to do that, I'm gonna have to set you on the floor for a moment. Is that okay?"</p>
		<p>"What?" the blonde feigned indignation. You mean you can't just flex those well exercised muscles of yours and simply sweep us both up off this floor?"</p>
		<p>The brunette grinned wryly at the jibe. "Well, normally I could. But as I've been sitting here for the past hour with a certain blonde in my lap, my legs have fallen asleep. And I'm gonna have to move that certain blonde to get some circulation back."</p>
		<p>"Suuurre, blame it on the blonde," the writer returned with a roll of her eyes, then squeaked out a yelp as she was effortlessly lifted in strong arms and shifted to the left before being gently deposited on the carpet. Green eyes watched with barely concealed admiration as the raven-haired woman rose with fluid grace. She gave herself a small moment to regain the feeling in her legs, then reached down and gathered the smaller woman into her arms.</p>
		<p>"Okay, chair or couch; where would you like me to dump?er?place you?" the doctor grinned rakishly at the narrow-eyed glare her intentional gaff produced.</p>
		<p>"The couch, if you please," the writer huffed with playful indignity. "My butt's a little sore from sitting in the chair for so long."</p>
		<p>
			<i>I will not go there?I will not go there?I will not go there. </i> "Your wish is my command," the brunette intoned as she deposited her petite patient on the couch, immediately missing the contact.
		</p>
		<p>Placing the ottoman closer to the couch, the doctor gently lifted the younger woman's legs and set them on it.</p>
		<p>"How about we do 'light' tonight? I'll put together some sandwiches and heat up some of that French onion soup you like so much."</p>
		<p>A blinding smile and eager nodding gave her all the answer she needed. "Great! I'll be back in a little bit." With that, she turned and left the room.</p>
		<p>Never aware of green eyes that studiously observed her backside as it exited the room.</p>
