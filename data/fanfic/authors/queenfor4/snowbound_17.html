<!-- Snowbound \ Chapter Seventeen -->

<p>Megan lay in bed, listening to the tinny ringing of the telephone, and feeling her annoyance level steadily rising.
			<i>No answer. Big surprise there, the writer mentally snorted. He doesn't answer the phone, doesn't check the messages, doesn't return my calls. What the fuck is going on here? </i>
		</p>
		<p>Taking a deep breath in a vain attempt to dispel some of her aggravation, she picked up the phone again and dialed a familiar number.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Hello?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Has Eric Chalmers dropped off the face of the earth, or is it just me?" the writer snarled into the phone.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Well, hello to you too, dear. I'm fine?thanks for asking."</b>
		</p>
		<p>Having been properly chastised, the young woman sighed and began again. "I'm sorry. Hi, Charly. How's my favorite publisher?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Your 'only' publisher is fine,"</b> the older woman chuckled at the long running tease between them. Then sobering, she added,
			<b>"And as for your 'Mr. Wonderful,' I'm afraid I have no clue. Although, from the almost daily activity with your bank account, I'd venture to say that dear Mr. Chalmers hasn't wandered far."</b>
		</p>
		<p>Megan felt the hairs on the back of her neck begin to bristle. "What's that supposed to mean?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"It means, honey, that Eric has been making good use of the ATM card that you provided him with - to the tune of about fifteen thousand dollars so far. He's been hitting the ATM machines just about every day. The only reason it's not more is because there's a limit on how much he can take out in a one day period." </b> The silence on the other end was deafening. There was one thing that Charlotte Grayson never wanted to do; and that was hurt her young friend. But that, unfortunately, was just what was happening. There was no way around it though. Megan was not a child and, like it or not, she had to be made aware of these things.
		</p>
		<p>Knowing that, however, did not make the older woman feel any better.</p>
		<p>"Fine," the younger woman said, suddenly sounding very old. "Charly, can you please contact the bank for me and have them deactivate his ATM card? I think there are forms that have to be signed and, with you having power of attorney for me, you'll be able to do that. I know I'm asking a lot, but?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Don't worry about it, baby,"</b> the older woman interrupted.
			<b>"That's one of the pitfalls?er?perks of being your 'unofficial' manager," </b>she kidded.
			<b> "It's also part of being a surrogate mom. Somebody's gotta look after your little blonde butt," </b>she added warmly.
		</p>
		<p>"And you do that very well," the blonde responded, with a thickness in her throat. "I'll never be able to thank you enough for what you've been for me over the years." The writer broke off quickly, needing a moment to regain her equilibrium.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Pshh, don't worry about it. I'll just come and live with you when I get too old and crotchety to work anymore."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"And I'll be more than happy to have your cantankerous old butt staying with me," the blonde responded cheekily, silently appreciating the older woman's attempt to lighten her mood.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Watch it, little girl, or I'll show you cantankerous when I see you."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Oooh, I'm scared," the blonde mock-shuddered. "Anyway," the blonde huffed out a breath. "Thanks a bunch, Charly. I owe you one." She thought for a moment, then added, "oh, and while you're at it, can you have them suspend Eric's credit card too. If Mr. Chalmers wants to pretend I don't exist, he's going to have to do it without my money. There shouldn't be any problems with the bank. But if there is, just have them call me here at Randi's house."</p>
		<p>
			<b>
				<i> "Oooh, it's not 'that woman' or 'the doctor' anymore. It's 'Randi' now," </i>
			</b> the older woman cheerfully noted.
			<b> "Speaking of the good doctor, how are things going?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>The subtle change of subject didn't go unnoticed, but Megan let it slide. Nor could she help but notice the hopeful optimism behind the question.</p>
		<p>Or the unexpectedly pleasant warmth that filled her when she thought of the tall doctor.</p>
		<p>"Things are going great," she smiled. "As a matter of fact, she took the splint off my leg today. And then she took me out to the porch so I could get some fresh air. She's got a great view of the mountains from one side of the porch. After a while, my leg started to get tired, so she sat me down in the bench swing on her porch, and went in and made some tea for us. After that, we just sat there for a while and talked."</p>
		<p>Charly was both amused and heartened by her friend's happy rambling.
			<b>
				<i> "She hasn't sounded this lighthearted in a long time." </i> "It sounds like Dr. Oakes has taken good care of you, my friend."
			</b>
		</p>
		<p>"She has," the writer admitted, guiltily. "She's been kind and gentle and patient. Even when I was acting like an ass, she was caring for me." The writer paused thoughtfully, then continued. " I owe her a great deal, Charly. More than I think I can ever repay."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"I don't think she ever cared about repayment,"</b> the older woman answered softly.
			<b>"I think that's just the way she is. I made those 'discreet inquiries' we talked about some weeks back, and everyone I was able to talk to said the same thing - that Randi was an outstanding physician. The key words I kept hearing were dedicated, hard working, gentle, caring. I could go on, but I think you get the idea. In other words,"</b> the publisher smiled,
			<b>"you lucked out, little one."</b>
		</p>
		<p>Megan lay her head back on the pillow as an indulgent smile crawled across her lips. "I believe you're right, Charly. As much as I hate to admit it, you were right from the beginning."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"In light of that admission, I'll refrain from saying 'I told you so' " </b>the publisher returned, with smug playfulness.
			<b>"So, how much longer before you're able to come home? Is the road up there going to be clear any time soon?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>Megan's head jerked up off the pillow as she remembered why she was trying to call Eric in the first place. "Yes, the road leading up here is just about finished. I was going to call you after I talked to Eric and let you know. My car is history, so Randi's checking with a company in Knox to see if they can provide a car and driver to bring me back home."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"You'll do no such thing, young lady,"</b> the publisher proclaimed.
			<b>"I'll send one of our cars for you. You just name the time and place."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"You don't have to do that, Charly," the writer admonished. "I don't want to put anyone to any trouble."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"You're not. These are company cars and company drivers, Meg. This is what they get paid to do. You're one of our most prolific and best selling authors. I would be remiss in my duties if I left you to find your own way back home. So, stop arguing with this 'cantankerous' old lady, and tell me when and where."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Well, um, I suppose Sunday will be good. I can have Randi take me into Cutter's Gap, and the car can pick me up there. I can call you back with a definite time frame," the writer finished in a much more subdued tone.</p>
		<p>The change in the younger woman's voice did not go unnoticed by the older woman, but she decided not to question it.
			<b> "That sounds wonderful, dear. It will be wonderful to have you back." </b>
		</p>
		<p>"It'll be wonderful to be back," the writer answered, hoping she sounded more enthusiastic than she felt. "Charly, I'm gonna let you go for now. I'm having the damnedest time keeping my eyes open."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"You go ahead and get your sleep, honey. I'll contact the bank first thing in the morning and start making the arrangements to come get you."</b> The publisher paused briefly as another thought forced its way to the forefront.
			<b> "Um, what should I tell him if he calls and wants to know why he's been cut off?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Just tell him it was my decision, and I'll discuss it with him when I return and not before."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"It will be my pleasure,"</b> the publisher purred.
			<b>"You get some rest now, and I'll see you in a few days. Sweet dreams, honey." </b>
		</p>

			<i>You go, girl! </i>The older woman mentally chortled as she hung up the phone.
			<i>You're growing up, opening your eyes, and gaining a backbone. It's beginning to look like that accident was the best thing that could have happened to you. I can't wait to meet your Dr. Oakes. She seems to be a most remarkable woman. </i> The publisher looked at the phone for a long moment, weighing, once again, professional ethics against maternal instincts. With a weary sigh, she reached for the receiver, as maternal instinct raised its fist in victory.
		</p>
		<p>While, many miles away, a young woman tossed and turned fitfully in her bed, completely at a loss to explain why her long-awaited return to 'civilization' wasn't making her feel as good as it should.
			<i>That's not so hard to figure out," </i> little Charly helpfully supplied, "
			<i>you don't want to leave her. Face it, Meggie, you've grown quite attached to the good doctor. You know that when you leave here, the chances of seeing Randi again are slim, and that's tearing you apart. </i> "But
			<b>why</b> does it hurt like this?" the young woman whispered plaintively. "I've had friends before that I've had to leave behind, and it never felt like this."
			<i> Because she has become so much more than a friend, little one. And someday soon, when you're ready, you'll understand. </i> "I don't want 'someday,' Goddammit," the blonde growled as she turned on her side and punched the pillow into submission. "I want to understand 'now' why I can't stand the thought of leaving her. I want to understand why I care so much for someone who represents everything I hate. I want to understand why I feel so warm and safe in her arms. And I
			<b>really</b> wanna understand why I get a warm tingling in my stomach when I watch her work out. I'm not like that?am I? Damn you, mother! Where are you when I need answers? Where are you when I need
			<b>you</b>?" Frustrated and confused, the young woman buried her face in the pillow and let silent tears fall.
		</p>
		<p>And down the hall, another young woman lay prone in her bed, staring at the ceiling. Torn between happiness and heartache, the tall woman paid no heed to the abundant tears that made lazy trails down her cheeks. She was profoundly happy for Megan's recovery and glad that the young woman would soon be able to return to her home and her friends. She was happy for Megan, true. But a very large part of her grieved for the fact that, when the young woman left, she would be taking Randi's heart with her.</p>
		<p>And right along with that, the only happiness that the doctor had known in such a long time.</p>
		<p>
			<i>It'll all be over in a few days, Uncle Jake. Come the weekend, she'll be able to kiss this town, and me, goodbye. She can get back to her life and her friends and forget we ever existed. I should be happy for her, Uncle Jake. Hell, I
				<b>am</b> happy for her, but it's gonna hurt so damn much. Is this the way it's always gonna be? Am I always going to lose the people I love? Have I been so bad that I don't deserve to be happy? Ever? I don't think I can take it much more, Uncle Jake.
			</i> " I can't," she whispered brokenly as she turned her face into the pillow and gave way to heartwrenching sobs.
		</p>
		<p>Two silent figures sat in the doorway, watching the tall body on the bed convulse in quiet sobs. Both animals shivered in empathic response to the profound sadness that radiated from this woman and the one down the hall. They looked at each other for a long moment, communicating on their own level, before the small, fair-haired one rose and ambled down the hall.</p>
		<p>With an audible sigh, the black Shepherd quietly padded across the room and eased herself up on the bed. With a gentleness that belied her size, she settled her large frame against the body of her friend.</p>
		<p>There would be no 'tough' approach this time. Nor any attempt to 'cuddle' the human out of her funk. No, the woman didn't need that this time. She just needed to know that she was not alone. And the beautiful black was there to provide that assurance. No matter how long it took.</p>
