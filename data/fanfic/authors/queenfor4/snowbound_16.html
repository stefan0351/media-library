<!-- Snowbound \ Chapter Sixteen -->

<p>Randi sighed, for perhaps the twentieth time, as she placed the bowl of soup in the microwave and turned it on. She never knew she could feel so good and so bad at the same time. She was happy, no; elated with the unexpected friendship that had developed between her and the once bitter and spiteful young writer. For beneath the veneer of anger and mistrust, there was a bright, witty, gentle, and utterly charming young woman that one could easily fall in love with.</p>
		<p>And that was the problem.</p>
		<p>Against all odds. Against all good reason. Against every shred of common sense she'd ever possessed, Randi had, indeed, fallen in love with her. And that was the bad part; she knew, without a doubt, that love would never be returned.
			<i>Hell, she'd do her level best to kill me if she knew. </i> Tears burned her eyes as she chuckled at the bitter irony.
			<i>Leave it to me to fall in love with a woman who is not only straight, but is homophobic too. I guess it's no less than I deserve, is it, Casey." </i>
		</p>
		<p>The chiming of the microwave interrupted her morose musings. As she set about transferring the soup to smaller bowls, she concentrated on a fact that was as much a source of pain as relief.
			<i>According to Toby, the main roads are mostly clear, and they'll be able to concentrate on getting my road cleared within the next week or so. Then Ms. Megan can get back to her happy life, and I can get back to ? </i>
		</p>
		<p>The intense aching in her heart didn't allow her to finish that thought, as she picked up the dinner tray and walked out of the kitchen.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Heads up everyone! Meals on heels is headed your way," the doctor cheerfully proclaimed as she entered the room; bringing a bright smile to the young face that, only a moment ago, was wreathed in sober thought.</p>
		<p>"God, that smells delightful," the writer exclaimed, as the smells from the steaming bowl of soup assailed her nostrils and made her mouth water.</p>
		<p>"Merci," the doctor replied in an exaggerated French accent as she carefully placed the tray in the amused blonde's lap; then sketched a humble bow as she proclaimed, "Nozzing but ze best for Madame."</p>
		<p>"Ooohh, tall, dark, beautiful,
			<b>and</b> charming. Be still, my galloping heart," the blonde retorted, as she batted her eyelashes and mock-fanned her face in a coquettish manner.
			<i>Did I say beautiful? </i>
		</p>
		<p>"And humble. Don't forget that!" the brunette shot back, as she padded back to the kitchen for her tray.
			<i>Did she say beautiful? </i>
		</p>
		<p>Ricky Van Shelton crooned in the background as the two women ate in amiable silence. Finally, having reached a decision, Megan cleared her throat.</p>
		<p>"She left a few weeks after my fifteenth birthday."</p>
		<p>Randi's eyes snapped to the blonde's face, but she kept silent; knowing the young woman was gathering her courage to continue.</p>
		<p>"I remember coming home from school in a really great mood." She smiled at the memory. "I got great marks on a really nasty exam that I had been sweating over, and my English teacher, who I thought hated my guts, took a moment to tell me that I was one of her best students, and she believed I had potential in the literary world. I was one happy camper. When I got home, I just about vibrated into the house. I remember running through the house hollering for mom so I could tell her all about it. When I got to the kitchen I saw my dad sitting at the table, which was unusual 'cause he wasn't due home for a couple more hours. Anyway, he was sitting at the table holding a piece of paper, and he said, in this really dead tone of voice, that mom wasn't home. I asked him when she was gonna be home and he didn't answer me. He just handed me the piece of paper." Megan paused, taking deep breaths in an effort to maintain control. Having accomplished this, she continued. "To this day, I remember every word in that short and not-so-sweet little note. It said: 'Dear Peter. I wish I had the courage to tell you this in person but, unfortunately, I don't. Forgive me, Peter, but I can't live with you anymore. Caitlin has been pleading with me for a very long time to move in with her. I have finally agreed. For with her, I will have something that you have been unable to give me for years; and that, dear Peter, is love. I have talked to Edwin, and he has agreed to handle the divorce proceedings. I, of course, will accept all blame and will not seek any material or financial compensation. It is the least I can do. I'm sorry, Peter.' And that was that," the writer sighed heavily, "she never mentioned me at all. No 'see ya, kid' or 'we'll be in touch, Meg.' Just very brief and concise, no embellishments, no apologies?hell, she didn't even sign her name."</p>
		<p>"That must have been terrible for you and your dad," the brunette murmured, wanting to reach out and comfort her friend, but not sure if it would be welcome at this point.</p>
		<p>"It was seven kinds of hell for me," she admitted. "But, to be honest, I have no idea how it was for my dad." At Randi's puzzled look, the writer explained. "My dad's never been much for showing feelings. He always believed that being emotional or outwardly affectionate was for women and fags." Megan winced inwardly at the word she didn't much care to use anymore. "My mother's desertion only served to make him even more remote. He clothed me and fed me, and made sure I did well in school, and that's as far as it went. If I was lonely, or hurting, well?let's just say I learned to keep it to myself." Megan turned pained eyes to her listener, "Don't get me wrong, Randi. He wasn't cruel, he just?wasn't."</p>
		<p>"Your mother never tried to call or visit?at all?" Randi inquired as she removed the trays to a nearby table and curled herself onto the couch, closer to the younger woman. She had a hard time believing that Megan's mother would abandon her daughter just like that. Her husband, maybe?but not her child.
			<i>And not even a word to her in the note? That's way too odd. </i>
		</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>"Oh, she tried to visit, all right," the writer sneered. "Seven years later. She had the nerve to come to my father's funeral. Telling me how sorry she was that he had died and asking to talk to me."</p>
		<p>"What did you do?"</p>
		<p>Megan had a far away look in her eye. "I told her she had nothing to say that I wanted to hear. If she wanted to talk to me, she should have done so years ago, instead of running off and pretending I didn't exist. She tried telling me she didn't do that, that she loved me, and I guess everything just crashed on me at one time, 'cause I?" Megan faltered, as vivid memories and emotions threatened to overwhelm her. "I hit her," she gasped out. "I slapped her across the face and started screaming at her, telling her not to dare say she loved me, because you don't leave someone you love. You don't hurt her. You don't leave her to wonder what she did wrong to make you leave like that and never see her again. I guess dad's police friends had had enough, 'cause they came and told her to leave. Then they led me back to the car. I remember looking back one last time, and seeing her standing there, with all these tears running down her face, and I thought to myself, now you know how I feel. I never saw her again." The young woman studied her hands as they idly plucked at a loose thread in the blanket that covered her legs. "Pretty pathetic, wasn't I?" she whispered.</p>
		<p>"No," the brunette responded, as she placed a large hand over the two smaller ones. "I'd say pretty hurt. You were dealing with a lot of pain at the time. It's quite normal to lash out at someone you feel was responsible for a great deal of that pain."</p>
		<p>Megan stiffened. "I didn't just
			<b>feel</b> that she was responsible?she
			<b>was</b> responsible. Her and her 'lover.' The last word was spat like a curse.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Okay, she's feeling way too prickly to open a discussion on that subject. Let's go somewhere else. </i> "Who is this Caitlin? Was she a friend of the family?"
		</p>
		<p>Megan relaxed slightly, but retained a scowl. "No. She was my mother's friend. When I was thirteen, mom joined a Tai chi class where Caitlin was one of the instructors. She started out only going there twice a week. But with me spending more time with my friends, and dad spending most of his time at the office anyway, she increased it to five nights a week. After a while, they started spending time together outside of class. Dad didn't seem to pay it much attention He was a CPA, and he spent a lot of time either at the office or hanging out with his cop buddies, who were also his best clients. I didn't pay it much attention either, because Caitlin seemed like a cool person, and I had my friends, so why shouldn't she have hers." Megan closed her eyes as a lonely tear wandered down a pale cheek. "I didn't know friends were supposed to tear families apart," she whispered brokenly.</p>
		<p>Megan looked so small and so very lost. And Randi, for the first time, got a glimpse at the sad and lonely young girl that lived inside the bitter and spite-filled woman.</p>
		<p>And it broke her heart.</p>
		<p>Once again, she allowed her heart to overrule her head, as she spread open her arms; silently offering that young girl the comfort she was denied those long years ago.</p>
		<p>And with a sniffle and a sigh, she accepted.</p>
		<p>"They're not supposed to," the brunette whispered to the golden head tucked beneath her chin. "And they usually don't. But sometimes it happens. Even when they don't mean it to."</p>
		<p>And the evening wore on, much as the afternoon had, with a small body finding a haven in warm, comforting arms. Randi grieved for the pain that her patient had endured, but something in the back of her mind kept telling her that there was more to the story than even Megan knew. But the tall woman doubted she would ever be in a position to find out for sure.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Are you sure you're ready for this?" the tall doctor questioned with a grin that earned her a green-eyed glare. "'Cause if you're not, I can leave it on for a while longer."</p>
		<p>"If you don't remove this damn thing right now, I'm going to rip it off myself," the blonde mock-growled. "And then I'm going to stuff it someplace that's gonna make you, and a proctologist, very unhappy."</p>
		<p>"God, some women are just so grouchy," the doctor playfully complained as she set about removing the splint from the blonde's slender leg. After six and a half long weeks, Megan was more than ready to have the restrictive casing removed from her leg. She'd had the arm splint removed a couple of days ago, but the doctor wanted to leave the leg splint on a little longer, preferring to have the young woman do some walking exercises with the aid of a crutch first. That would allow the limb to regain some strength before removing the stiff support.</p>
		<p>Megan sighed in blissful relief as the leg was finally released from its restrictive prison. The doctor graced her with an understanding smile as skilled hands began a probing massage of the freed limb; an action that allowed her to feel for any abnormalities while stimulating the muscles.</p>
		<p>
			<i>God, she looks so tired, </i> the writer mused, with no small worry. The past week had been bad; with the tall woman's nightmares visiting every other night. Megan would lie in bed, listening to the heartbreaking pleas, as Randi begged the mysterious Casey not to leave her. Wishing, time after time, that she could go to her, and cursing, time after time, the damaged limbs that prevented her from doing so. Megan had tried, a couple of times, to get the recalcitrant doctor to talk about her nightmares; even asking outright who Casey was. But the doctor politely refused to discuss the contents of her nightmares, and would only say that Casey was a friend. It was a vague answer that left the young writer frustrated in her friend's unwillingness to confide in her and agonizingly curious about the oft mentioned Casey. Her fertile writer's imagination tended to speculate that Casey had been a sweetheart that the doctor had loved and lost.
		</p>
		<p>Megan studied the face of the woman who was intently focused on the leg she was tending. The strong, high cheekbones that only last week were a healthy tan were now drawn and slightly pale. The full, red lips that always seemed to be on the verge of a smile were now drawn and barely pink. And the eyes that once contained all the warmth and beauty of a summer sky were now pale and gray.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Dammit, Randi, I wish you'd let me in. Let me try to help you, as you've helped me. I care about you, Randi, more than you know. More than I ever thought I could. It hurts to see you suffer like this and not be able to do a damn thing about it. </i>
		</p>
		<p>As if sensing the blonde's thoughtful scrutiny, the brunette looked up and offered a tender, sweet smile that, much to the writer's chagrin, turned her insides to something resembling warm oatmeal.</p>
		<p>"Feel like taking this leg out for a little test run?" the doctor inquired.</p>
		<p>"Run?" the blonde squeaked.</p>
		<p>"Okay, okay. Maybe a slow stroll." The brunette paused for a moment, quietly formulating a plan, then grinned. "How about a stroll out to the porch? It's fully enclosed and runs the entire front half of the house. You can check out the view from the front and sides. There's a large and comfy bench swing out there, where you can give your leg a rest while I scare up some hot tea for the both of us. We can sit for a while and watch the dynamic doggy duo fend off marauding warrior squirrels in between taking potshots at each other."</p>
		<p>The doctor's idea was positively scintillating.
			<i>God, I haven't been outside for so long? </i> "That sounds wonderful," the writer enthused. Then, making the mistake of once again meeting those bluer than blue eyes, she added, "I, uh, I don't want to use the crutch if I don't have to. Will you, um?will you stay beside me? In case I stumble?or something," the writer finished lamely, silently cursing herself for feeling and acting like a shy, teenage schoolgirl.
		</p>
		<p>Randi stood to her full height and held her hand out to the seated blonde. Pulling her gently to her feet, the doctor looked deeply into springtime green eyes. "I'll stay by you forev?for as long as you want me to," the doctor announced solemnly as she placed the writer's smaller hand on her arm and led her out of the room.</p>
