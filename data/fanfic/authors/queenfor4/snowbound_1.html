<!-- Snowbound \ Chapter One -->

<p>"Mmmm, yesss,"</p>
		<p>She was having a wonderful dream. A warm wet tongue was lightly teasing her ear, and it was feeling rather good. Then something very cool and not so wet plunged directly in her ear and exhaled in a loud 'Snoof'.</p>
		<p>"Yaahhh!"</p>
		<p>Her head shot straight up off the pillow. Her heart hammering, she looked around wildly. Then her eyes settled on a dark figure sitting next to her bed. The black triangular head tilted slightly, and blue eyes studied her with mischievous curiosity.</p>
		<p>She lowered herself back down and turned so that she was nose to nose with the furry face. She glared at the unrepentant animal.</p>
		<p>"You can be replaced with a goldfish at any time, you know."</p>
		<p>Her answer was a belligerent growl and a muted 'woof'. She narrowed her eyes and opened her mouth for a retort, but the canine turned her back on her and sauntered to the bedroom door and paused, looking back at her expectantly.</p>
		<p>Gazing at the dawning sunlight that snuck through her curtained window, she flopped over on her back and sighed. Feeling a slight movement at her feet, she looked down at the small butter golden canine that lay curled by her feet. The animal looked at her with sleepy, sympathetic eyes, then lowered her head back to her paws and closed her eyes.</p>
		<p>Randi sat up and gently nudged the animal on her back and lightly scratched her belly.</p>
		<p>"Oh no ya don't. If I have to get up with the dragon lady, so do you," she informed the squirming, stretching animal that decided if she had to get up, then this was a most pleasant way to do it.</p>
		<p>Randi climbed out of bed and padded down the hallway, flanked by her furry companions. She stopped by the kitchen to pour herself a cup of freshly brewed coffee and silently thanked whatever gods might be listening for coffee makers with automatic timers. She continued on through the spacious livingroom to the foyer, where she opened the front door for her four legged friends. They both shot through the door and down the steps of the porch, scurrying into the woods to take care of business. Once finished, they got down to the serious business of playing.</p>
		<p>Randi stood and watched the playful pair as they ran and wrestled in the crisp, early autumn air, wondering once again where this unlikely pair came from. They had just shown up on her property one day. The little one had been hurt; blood matted her fur from shoulder to mid-chest. She limped along gamely, being nudged, coaxed, and almost dragged by her midnight-black companion. They made it halfway to the porch before the smaller animal gave up and just lay down. The larger animal sat down beside her and alternated between looking up at Randi and giving little nudging licks to her exhausted companion. Randi took the hint and approached the pair slowly, murmuring softly so as not to alarm them. Gentle cinnamon eyes regarded her patiently as she gently examined the bloody shoulder of the smaller animal. The tall woman winced at the long deep gashes that marred the silken fur. "Well, this is bad," she said to herself as much as to the ebony canine that watched her intently. "But it can be fixed. You're going to have to let me get her inside if I'm going to help her." And, as if understanding, the larger animal backed up and let the woman pick up the little one and bring her inside. Randi sutured the little canine's wounds and made a place in the kitchen for her to rest and recover. The larger animal never left her side, except to answer nature's call and take small amounts of food and water that Randi provided. The little one recovered fairly quickly and, as if by unspoken agreement, they had been with the solitary woman ever since. Their devotion to each other, much like their sudden appearance in her life, was a mystery, but Randi had to admit, she enjoyed it.</p>
		<p>Randi shook herself out of her reverie and looked up, taking note of the heavy gray clouds that were moving in quickly and efficiently, overtaking the sun.
			<i>This doesn't look good, </i>she mused to herself. Walking back inside the house, she flicked on the radio on her way to the kitchen. The radio was tuned to a local country music station, and she listened to Wynona rocking to the rhythm of the rain as she toasted a bagel and rummaged in the refrigerator for some cream cheese. She munched idly through the news and sports, paying close attention when Kip Kilbourne's too cheerful voice began to announce the weather.

		<p>"Well folks, it's time to stock up your pantries and break out those snowshoes. This is going to be a big one. There's a high-pressure system moving our way from the great white north, and it's gonna meet up with another fast moving front from the east. And three guesses where they're gonna meet up with each other. You got it! Cutters Gap, Pike Mountain, and surrounding areas are going to be hit hard. Snowfall should begin about mid-day today, and I don't look for it to stop until late Friday. Now this is Tuesday, folks. So think about that while you prepare. Especially you guys up there on the ridge, 'cause it's likely going to be a while before you can make it down here again. We'll keep you posted as things develop."</p>
		<p>Randi sighed and ran her fingers through tousled raven hair, doing a mental inventory of what she would need to tide her over for at least five weeks. For that would likely be how long it took before the road leading to and from her secluded hilltop home would be clear. The list would be short, as she had a fully stocked pantry and an abundance of meat in the freezer housed in the garage.
			<i>Perhaps some extra Kerosene for the emergency generator and another 50 pound bag of dog food for my furry friends, </i>she mused to herself.
			<i>Ooohh, and maybe Toby has gotten a new shipment of paperbacks in. Reading fanfic on the net is fine, but it's not real comfy reading when I'm in bed, even on the laptop. Ugh, I guess I'd better get this over with.</i> Finishing her coffee in one gulp, she headed back to her room to shower and dress for the dreaded trip to Cutters Gap.
