<!-- Snowbound \ Chapter Eleven -->

<p>The doctor briskly dried her hands as she exited the bathroom. "Well, that didn't take long," she commented cheerfully as she moved about the room gathering her things. "The stitches are healing quite nicely, and the bruising pretty quickly. I was pleasantly surprised that you didn't suffer any internal damage or develop an infection." Randi paused and met the green eyes that had been surreptitiously watching her as she moved about the room. "All things considered, Ms Galagher, we were pretty lucky."</p>
		<p>The blonde grimaced and turned her face toward the blinds-covered window. "Forgive me, Dr. Oakes, if my interpretation of 'lucky' differs from yours," she replied hollowly.</p>
		<p>Randi pursed her lips for a thoughtful moment. "Yeah, well, I can see as how it would. But I guess it all boils down to perspective. You look at it as what
			<b>has</b> happened, and how perfectly miserable you are right now. I look at it as what
			<b>could have</b> happened, and how perfectly miserable many people would be, at the loss of such a great storyteller." Randi finished with a crooked grin.

		<p>Megan stared at the brunette with narrowed eyes. Every nerve in her body screamed
			<i>She's lying! She's just saying things she thinks you want to hear! </i> But another voice penetrated the cacophony.
			<i>But what if she's not? What if she's really sincere? </i> The writer closed her eyes and sighed. A decision had been made.
			<i>What do I really have to lose right now? </i> But she had just one question.
		</p>
		<p>"Why?"</p>
		<p>The tall woman was confused. "Why? Why what?"</p>
		<p>"Why are you so nice to me?"</p>
		<p>The smile returned with a playful arch of her eyebrow. "Why not?"</p>
		<p>Two words, agonizingly simple, but complex enough to leave the wordsmith floundering for a rejoinder that never came. The tall woman didn't give her time to fret over the verbal inadequacy though, as she began speaking again.</p>
		<p>"You know, it occurred to me that you sit in here, day in, day out, with absolutely nothing to do but stare at the walls. I don't have a TV for this room, and I don't think you'd care for the books I have." This last part said with a guilty grin that earned her a withering glare from the blonde. Ignoring the look, she continued. "I'm still working on a way to get you out of this room for a while. But, until I do," the brunette stopped talking momentarily as she walked over to the big chair and picked up the item she had laid there earlier, "I figured you might occupy yourself with this for a while."</p>
		<p>Megan gasped as the doctor gently placed the laptop computer in her lap. "Oh, God."</p>
		<p>The tall woman made quick work of connecting the modem line to the wall outlet. Then, reaching over, she lifted the lid and tapped the power switch.</p>
		<p>The absolutely joyful smile on the younger woman's face as the darkened screen came to life made Randi's heart do cartwheels.
			<i>Houston, we have liftoff. </i>
		</p>
		<p>"I've got MSN as my service provider," she explained to the blonde, who was already tapping keys, "but I also have access to AOL and Netscape. You can 'surf' to your heart's content, check your email, find some fanfic sites if you want to do some reading, or?" she held up the floppy discs she'd removed from her back pocket, "do some writing. It may be a little awkward with your bad arm, but I don't think that will stop you."</p>
		<p>Seeing that the writer's attention was already riveted to her new toy, the doctor chuckled to herself.
			<i>I guess it's time for me to stop babbling and make my exit. </i> "Well," the doctor began, as she placed the discs on the folding table, "I guess I'd better?" She was stopped cold by a tentative hand placed briefly on hers.
		</p>
		<p>Startled blue eyes collided with green for a fleeting instant, before the green moved down swiftly to the keyboard.</p>
		<p>"I?" Nervous fingers caressed the keyboard, "I?um?thank you. You didn't have to do all this, but I really appreciate it."</p>
		<p>"I know I didn't have to," the tall woman responded, smiling warmly, "but I wanted to. And you're very welcome."</p>
		<p>A comfortable silence settled between the two women as they absorbed the comfort of a moment that, for once, was not clouded by fear, mistrust or defensiveness.</p>
		<p>The furry blonde head appearing in the doorway broke the moment. "It looks like you have a visitor," the tall woman chuckled.</p>
		<p>"Or two," the writer added as a larger, midnight-colored head joined the first. "Hello, ladies," she greeted, as the two canines cautiously entered the room.</p>
		<p>The tall woman squatted down and stroked a golden head with one hand, while reaching her other hand out in anticipation of the large black paw that settled in it; an apparent ritual that the author observed with an expression of bemused curiosity that did not go unnoticed by the doctor.</p>
		<p>"Miss 'Attitude' doesn't seem to like being petted," the doctor offered in explanation. "She'd rather do the handshake thing." The blonde rolled her eyes, and the doctor just shrugged, "Hey, who am I to argue?" The tall woman rose to her full height, "Well, I've got some shoveling to do." Heading to the door, she noticed she had only one shadow. "Are you coming?" she inquired of the smaller canine that sat placidly by the foot of the bed. The lack of movement by the little one gave Randi her answer. "She seems to want to keep you company for a while," she announced to the blonde. "Is that all right with you?"</p>
		<p>The young woman looked down at the hopeful little face. "We'll be fine."</p>
		<p>The doctor nodded. "If you need anything, Ms Galagher, just tell her to come get me. Believe it, or not, she'll understand." As the tall woman turned to exit, she was halted by a single word.</p>
		<p>"Megan."</p>
		<p>"Excuse me?"</p>
		<p>The blonde's eyes stared fixedly at the computer screen, but her voice was soft.</p>
		<p>"My name is Megan."</p>
