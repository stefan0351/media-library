<!-- Snowbound \ Chapter Eighteen -->

<p>Saturday came entirely too fast, and both women spent the entire day trying to prepare, mentally and physically, for the writer's imminent departure. As a result, conversation was strained, and physical interaction was awkward at best. There was so much to say, but neither woman had the courage to say it.</p>
		<p>Dinner was a quiet affair, with both women doing little more than pushing the food around on their plates. Randi looked across the table at her petite patient.</p>
		<p>
			<i>She looks so sad. But why? She's finally getting out of here. That's what she's been wanting for months, so why isn't she kicking up her heels? Probably because of you, idiot! You're walking around here looking like a five year old that lost her puppy, and she doesn't want to make you feel any worse, so she's keeping a tight lid on any happiness she's feeling.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Well, that's gonna stop, </i>Randi decided, as she pulled her napkin off her lap and threw it on her plate. "Hey there," she addressed the blonde, startling her out of her depressed reverie. "It doesn't look like either one of us is very hungry, so why don't we just leave it. It's a pretty warm night, so why don't we go sit out on the porch? We can throw a few CD's on the player, and I can crack open a bottle of Merlot and we can celebrate your recovery and return to 'the World.'" This last part said with a mischievous wagging of her eyebrows.
		</p>
		<p>Megan saw the invitation for what it was; a sweetly subtle attempt to brighten her mood.
			<i>Still taking care of me, aren't you, doctor? </i> "That sounds wonderful," the blonde agreed.
		</p>
		<p>"So, what are your plans when you get back to the city?" Randi finally broached the subject that both women had been subtly avoiding. They had spent the evening sipping wine and discussing the weather, the history of Cutters Gap, the stars, everything but what the next day would bring. Now, the pregnant silence fairly screamed for one of them to step forward. And Randi complied.</p>
		<p>Megan gazed into the inky blackness of the surrounding forest, gathering thoughts that had become slightly muzzy from the three glasses of flavorful wine she had imbibed. Finally succeeding, she heaved a sigh. "I dunno, I guess I'll take a week to get things back in order. Do some editing on my current story, go through my mail, settle a couple of personal issues, things like that. Then, after that, let Charly re-schedule my book signings, and?go on from there, I guess." She turned and studied the graceful profile of the woman sitting next to her. "What about you. What'll you do?"</p>
		<p>Randi shrugged noncommittally. "Same as what I've been doing, I guess. Putter around the house, finish cleaning the attic, rescue another cute blonde," she concluded with a lopsided grin.</p>
		<p>"Funny girl," the writer shot back with an answering grin, then sobering, she said, "Can I ask you a personal question?"</p>
		<p>Warning bells sounded in Randi's head. "You can ask. No guarantees on an answer, though."</p>
		<p>"Fair enough," the blonde responded. "Randi, I know from first hand experience that you're an outstanding doctor. You have a God given talent for healing. And I'm not just talking about mending bodies. "The blonde paused in brief reflection before smiling gently. "You do wonders for troubled spirits, too. But I think you already know this. My question is, why are you hiding this wondrous gift away in a lonely house on a hill? Why aren't you actively practicing, either here or at the hospital in Knox?"</p>
		<p>The brunette closed her eyes against the pain that washed over her, threatening to pull her under.
			<i> I knew this was coming. </i> "I did work at Knox for a while. I completed my residency there," she responded listlessly.
		</p>
		<p>"So, why aren't you still there?"</p>
		<p>"Because I don't deserve to be there," she spit out with a vehemence that startled the writer.</p>
		<p>"Can you tell me why you feel that way?" the writer inquired gently.</p>
		<p>Megan watched silently as a flurry of emotions flitted across the chiseled features of the taller woman, mute testimony to the struggle within. Finally, "I can't, Megan," she whispered hoarsely, dropping her head. "I'm sorry?I just can't."</p>
		<p>Saddened and frustrated as she was, the young woman let the issue drop. Both women sat in contemplative silence for long moments as Trisha Yearwood crooned in the background, until Megan could take no more. She knew what song was coming next, and decided
			<i>What the hell, why not? </i> The young woman stood up, pausing for a moment to gather her equilibrium.
			<i>Whoa, good wine. </i>
		</p>
		<p>She then reached her hand out to the still seated doctor. "Dance with me?"</p>
		<p>Randi's head shot up, her face reflecting her surprise. "Here? Now?"</p>
		<p>"Why not?" the blonde smiled.</p>
		<p>Randi took the proffered hand and stood. Feeling awkward and unsure, she kept hold of the hand and placed her other hand tentatively on the blonde's shoulder as the opening music of the next song began.</p>
		<p>Megan was hard pressed not to giggle at the endearing shyness of the normally confident doctor. Deciding to take the bull by the horns, she looked up into impossibly blue eyes and sang along with the opening words of the song.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Don't be afraid to hold me tight, you know I won't break in two. What we're doing here tonight, sure beats what we're going through." </b>
		</p>
		<p>The young blonde smiled as the words had their intended effect, as the tall woman moved in closer, sliding her hand from Megan's shoulder to the small of her back. Satisfied, Megan sighed and placed her head on the warm, familiar shoulder.</p>
		<p>We both loved and lost before</p>
		<p>Know the sadness it can bring</p>
		<p>Tonight let's close the door</p>
		<p>And hold on to the nearest thing.</p>
		<p>Let's keep hanging on</p>
		<p>So we won't fall apart</p>
		<p>Let's make love tonight</p>
		<p>Like we never had a broken heart</p>
		<p>Warning bells rang madly in the tall woman's head as she held the smaller body close to her own.
			<i>I shouldn't be doing this. She's young, she's lonely, and she's feeling the effects of the wine. Hell, we
				<b>both</b> are. But this feels so good?so perfect?as if we've done this in countless other lifetimes. Just a few more minutes?that's all?then we'll stop.
			</i>With that, Randi's heart closed the door on those warning bells as the tall woman sighed and rested her cheek on a silky blonde head.
		</p>
		<p>Don't be afraid to close your eyes</p>
		<p>Pretend I'm someone that you love</p>
		<p>And I won't have to tell you lies</p>
		<p>'Cause it's not you I'm thinking of</p>
		<p>Let's keep hanging on</p>
		<p>So we won't fall apart</p>
		<p>Let's make love tonight</p>
		<p>Like we never had a broken heart.</p>
		<p>Megan was lost somewhere between ecstasy and awe. She had slow danced with Eric before, but it never felt as good?as perfect, as it did right now. The arms that held her close made her feel so cherished that it almost hurt. The long, lean body pressed so close to hers provoked responses from certain areas on her body so intense that it did hurt. And the heart beat, oh, that wonderfully intense rhythm that bounded against her ear somehow seemed to keep time with her own. There was only one small problem.
			<i>She's a woman! It's not supposed to feel this good.
				<b>I'm</b> not supposed to feel this good!
			</i>As the music chorus swelled, Megan made the mistake of looking up?and falling into twin pools of ocean blue.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Oh! I like that color. Is that what they look like when?</i> Her thoughts trailed off as the magic of the moment and the feel of the body moving against her effectively silenced them.
		</p>
		<p>Tonight we'll just pretend</p>
		<p>We've been in love right from the start</p>
		<p>Let's make love tonight</p>
		<p>Like we never had a broken heart.</p>
		<p>Almost as if they had a mind of their own, Megan's hands began to move. One of them pressed against the small of the taller woman's back and pressed firmly, melding both bodies tight, while the other hand tangled itself in silky, midnight hair. Gentle pressure brought the unresisting head closer as the blonde whispered the songs final line against full red lips.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Don't be afraid to close your eyes."</b>
		</p>
		<p>Megan's lips were sweet. Sweeter than Randi could ever have imagined. And she imagined quite a bit. And so it was no surprise that the tall woman drank greedily of the sweetness she had found there.</p>
		<p>No surprise that the fingers running through her hair sent electric tingles running through her body-tingles that ran from her head to her toes before finally settling in her belly.</p>
		<p>And started a fire there.</p>
		<p>No surprise that her thigh instinctually pressed against two smaller ones - that her tongue slid against soft lips, begging entrance.</p>
		<p>And thighs and lips parted for her.</p>
		<p>And certainly no surprise when her forays into those two places produced a very needy whimper.</p>
		<p>From a very lonely, very horny, very drunk
			<b>homophobic</b> young woman.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Dear lord, what am I doing? </i> Randi's eyes flew open and she jerked away as if burned. Her withdrawal so abrupt that the blonde limpet attached to her nearly fell.
		</p>
		<p>"Randi, what??"</p>
		<p>"We can't do this."</p>
		<p>"Yes we can," the blonde protested as she stood on tiptoes, desperately trying to reach those delicious, full, wet lips.</p>
		<p>"No, we can't," the brunette reiterated hoarsely as she gently held the blonde at bay.</p>
		<p>"Why," the smaller woman whined pitifully. She was more than a little aroused, and her level of intoxication only added to the feeling that she would perish if she didn't get relief?and soon.</p>
		<p>"Because you're drunk."</p>
		<p>"I am not," the blonde insisted, silently wishing it was not so damned hard to focus on the woman in front of her.</p>
		<p>"Yes, you are," Randi retorted, gentling her tone. "Megan, right now you're lonely, you're aroused, and more than a little tipsy. You may think you want this right now, but in the morning you'll feel very differently."</p>
		<p>"No I won't," the blonde growled, her temper rising to the fore.</p>
		<p>"Yes you will. You'll look at me in the morning and see a woman who took advantage of you in a weak moment. In your eyes I'll be that vicious, immoral sexual predator you think all gay women are?and you'll hate me for it."
			<i>Worse than that, my love, you'll hate yourself?for letting it happen. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Megan ceased her amorous advances, becoming completely still; she hung her head in defeat. Noting the seeming surrender, Randi removed her hands from the smaller woman. "Megan, I?"</p>
		<p>Randi's head rocked back from the force of the stinging slap that connected with her face.</p>
		<p>"You're wrong," the blonde spat hotly. "I already hate you. Damn you, Randi Oakes! Damn you!"</p>
		<p>The next sound Randi heard was the slamming of the screen door as she watched the blonde race down the hall to her room.</p>
		<p>And then there was only silence.</p>
		<p>Randi stood on the empty porch rubbing her stinging cheek. Her pleasant buzz had fled into the night. Her raging libido had tucked it's tail and followed.</p>
		<p>Now there was only emptiness.</p>
		<p>And pain.</p>
		<p>And Megan's words ringing in her head.</p>
		<p>
			<i>
				<b>"I hate you. Damn you, Randi Oakes! Damn you!"</b>
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>Randi's legs lost their battle as the heartsick woman sank to her knees and broke into wrenching sobs.</p>
