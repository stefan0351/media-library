<!-- Snowbound \ Chapter Nine -->

<p>Randi had a smile on her face as she gathered the items she would need to tend to Megan.
			<i>Well, she's not blowing kisses at me, but at least she's being a little more agreeable. Maybe it's because
				<b>you're</b> not being such a jerk, Randi.
			</i> The tall woman had to chuckle at the 'duh' quotient of that last thought. "Yeah, that definitely helps," she muttered aloud. Randi thought back to last night. She had lain awake for a long while after she got in bed. That in itself was not unusual; as she had lain awake many nights, her thoughts consumed by grief and guilt. What made last night different, was her preoccupation with a certain strawberry blonde. She could not, for the life of her, understand why she was so impatient with the writer. The young woman was biased and homophobic, true; but Randi had met many such people in her life, and had always been able to overlook their smallmindedness. Why was this woman different? Throughout her life, Randi had been gentle and caring. This was especially evident in her treatment of her patients, regardless of their temperament. Why did she allow the writer to get to her? Randi had no answers. All she knew was that her behavior was inexcusable.
			<i>Uncle Jake would be ashamed. </i> So the pretty Doctor came to the only conclusion she could live with; To knock the damn chip off of her shoulder and treat the blonde with the same kindness and respect that all her patients used to receive, regardless of the younger woman's ill manners.
			<i>And damned if it isn't making a little difference, </i>the brunette mused with a grin as she made her way back to her patient.
		</p>
		<p>"Hi, sorry it took so long," the doctor apologized as she bustled into the room. The blonde offered no response, as she stared morosely at the ceiling. Placing her things on a small folding table she had brought along, the brunette moved over to the bed.</p>
		<p>"Okay Ms.Galagher, we know I have to do some checking and changing, and we also know that you have to answer nature. What would you like to do first? It's your call."</p>
		<p>The young blonde's eyes flew to the doctor's face, searching for some sign of deceit, or condescending attitude. Genuinely surprised at finding neither, and unable to deal with the sincerity in those blue eyes, the writer looked away and mumbled, "I really have to go."</p>
		<p>"Okay, fine," the doctor returned as she moved to the closet. "There are some extra pillows and blankets in here. We can use them to raise your torso and leg a little bit, to make it easier for you to lift and situate yourself."</p>

		<p>One and a half-hours later, Megan was in that blissfully fuzzy place between the waking world and the peaceful oblivion of sleep. Her belly was somewhat full,
			<i>That broth was actually pretty good. </i> Her bladder was empty.
			<i>That wasn't anywhere near as bad as I thought it would be. </i>Her bandages were changed, and the doctor had given her something for the pain.
			<i>And then she rode off into the sunset?just like the hero in a bad western, </i> the writer giggled to herself as she drifted into the realm of dreams.

		<p>Randi lay sprawled in the big recliner. The massive stone fireplace had a roaring fire going, spreading toasty warmth throughout the room. The house was clean, the fireplace re-stocked with wood, and her patient was dozing comfortably. That left nothing for the brunette to do but to curl up with a book and catch up on some reading. A course of action that lasted all of ten minutes before blue eyes drifted closed and the book dropped from limp fingers. All too soon, relaxed muscles became rigid, facial muscles began to twitch, and eyeballs careened wildly beneath closed lids.</p>

				<p>The hallway seemed to stretch for miles as frantic feet raced along its length. The blue beacon flashed incessantly above the door. Bursting through the door, she found the room was in chaos. A cacophony of voices was vying to be heard. A willowy redhead stood in the far corner, hands covering trembling lips, tears streaming down a pale face. Machines cried out in alarm. A wiry black man in a white lab coat was on the bed, straddling a small body; rhythmically pushing on a small chest while grim faced nurse held a breather bag over an unmoving face. Moving to the bed, she barked, "What the hell's going on?"</p>
				<p>"She started having respiratory distress about a half hour ago," the dark man responded between compressions. "She's rejected any treatment we've tried. She was calling for you. We've been calling and paging," he informed her, not unkindly. " She went into full respiratory arrest about ten minutes ago, and then cardiac arrest just before you walked in. WHERE THE HELL IS THAT CRASH CART?</p>
				<p>As if on cue, the door burst open, as the requested machine was hustled in. Randi reached out and pulled the machine to her. Grabbing the paddles, she barked, "Get this damn thing fired up, STAT!" Turning to the tiny, pale child in the bed, she whispered, "Hang on, Casey. Don't leave me, baby."</p>

		<p>The dark head lifted. Blue eyes scanned her surroundings as triangular ears rotated left and right, searching, listening. She heard it again; a faint, keening 'noooo.' Raising up, she cast a glance to her honey-colored companion, who was listening worriedly to the sounds of distress, and then sauntered down the hall. Striding into the livingroom, she approached the recliner and paused, observing the writhing, moaning figure in the chair. With a mental shrug, she reached up and grabbed the nearest shirtsleeve in her teeth, and began to tug.</p>
		<p>Reaction to the tugging was almost immediate, as the raven-haired woman bolted up, ramrod straight, wide-eyed, and gasping. Her disorientation faded quickly as she looked down at the ebony canine that sat there staring at her. The strong, angular chin quivered as she looked into patient blue eyes. "I did it again, didn't I?"</p>
		<p>In answer, the dark canine reached over and lightly nibbled the length of her arm until she hit a spot that made the tall woman jump. "Aahh, you little shit!" Randi was on her feet now, rubbing the sensitive spot and glaring at the arrogant beast who was now sitting on the other side of the room, wagging her tail and looking at the tall woman with, what Randi would swear, was an evil grin.</p>
		<p>Woman and animal locked stares for a long moment, before the woman gave in. "All right, Ze, you win. I'm better now. Although," she chuckled as she squatted down, "I like your partner's remedy a lot better." The raven-haired canine moved closer to the squatting woman, until they were almost nose to nose. "You are
			<b>such</b> an asshole," she grinned to the animal. And had absolutely no chance to dodge the sloppy, wet, pink tongue that slapped her nose.

		<p>"Eeeewww!"</p>
