<!-- Snowbound \ Chapter Seven -->

<p>The tall woman cocked a bemused eyebrow. "Well?.that's not the normal response for saving someone's life, but?You're welcome."</p>
		<p>Megan's scathing response was reduced to a raspy squawk. The small blonde grimaced as she licked parched lips and tried to swallow the pound of sand that seemed to be sitting in her mouth. She flinched as she felt something touch her lips.</p>
		<p>"Here, sip this?.slowly," the tall woman cautioned, as she held the straw to the blonde's lips.</p>
		<p>The writer glared as she wrapped her lips around the slender tube, bristling at the perceived 'command' given by this?. Person, and proceeded to take several long, deep gulps of the wonderfully cool water.</p>
		<p>"Hey," the doctor exclaimed, as she pulled the straw away from greedy lips.</p>
		<p>Any protest the writer may have had to having her liquid treat removed, expired quickly. Her eyes bulged, as her stomach clenched painfully, and the liquid contents inside made a searing, painful journey back up her esophagus.</p>
		<p>Randi knew what was coming, and without missing a beat, she placed the water cup on the nightstand and picked up the small kidney-shaped bowl that she had placed there last night, and had it in place as the small woman lurched to the side and surrendered the contents of her stomach.</p>
		<p>Randi held the limp, sweaty strands of hair out of the young woman's face as she spasmed through the remaining dry heaves of her rebelling stomach. Finally, the writer flopped back in the bed with an exhausted groan.</p>
		<p>The tall woman simply couldn't help it. "Feel better now?" she inquired innocently.</p>
		<p>The writer glared, then squeezed her eyes shut as a wave of pain washed through her. "Wonderful, thank you," she responded through clenched teeth.</p>
		<p>
			<i>You're being a jerk; Randi's conscience scolded her. You're
				<b>supposed</b> to be a doctor! This woman is confused, exhausted, and in pain. You should be helping her?
				<b>not baiting her! </b>
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>With her self-lecture finished, the guilt-ridden brunette used a kinder tone to address her patient.</p>
		<p>"Ms. Galagher, I know you're extremely dry, thirsty, and maybe a little hungry. But, because of your concussion, and the trauma to your abdomen from the car seatbelt, your stomach is not able to handle whole lot. That's why I told you to sip the water slowly."</p>
		<p>Green eyes looked up at the tall woman warily.
			<i>You may not want to admit it, Meg?but she's right. </i> "Yes, of course, you're right," she mumbled. Taking a semi-deep breath, the blonde reined in her hostility for the moment. "Look, Dr. Oakes, I appreciate the fact that you saved my life and treated my injuries. But let's face it?you don't like me, and I don't like you. The sooner we part company, the better off we'll both be. If you will allow me to use your phone to call my agent, I can have her send an ambulance for me and take me back to New York. Once I'm settled, I'll make sure you are suitably reimbursed for your time and trouble."
		</p>
		<p>The tall woman grimaced internally.
			<i>She is gonna shit a brick. </i> Clearing her throat, the brunette walked around the bed, heading toward the window. "Well, Ms.Galagher, I'll be happy to let you use the phone to call your agent. I'm sure she'll be glad to know that you're okay." Grasping the cord to the window blinds, the brunette pulled, slowly raising the pale lavender shield. "But I'm afraid an ambulance is out of the question right now."
		</p>
		<p>The small blonde's eyes grew saucer-wide as she beheld the solid white world outside the window.</p>
		<p>"There's already more than two feet of snow out there," the doctor continued as she lowered the blinds. "Snowfall is expected to continue for at least another twenty four hours. With that amount of snowfall, it'll be six?perhaps seven weeks before the road leading up here will be clear. We're snowbound, Ms. Galagher, I'm sorry."</p>
		<p>Megan sat there, stunned. The impact of the tall woman's words sinking in.
			<i>I'll be at the mercy of this?this
				<b>pervert</b> for months!
			</i> Pain, anxiety, and unreasoning fear worked together to shatter what little grasp she had on civility. "You bitch," she rasped to the startled doctor. "You couldn't bring me into town for treatment?couldn't call an ambulance when you found me." Using her good hand, the agitated blonde threw back the bed covers and struggled to rise. Only to have a firm hand on her shoulder, impeding her efforts. "Let me go," she spat, still trying to rise, her green eyes sparking and her temper flaring. "I don't know what you hope to gain by imprisoning me here with you, but it won't work. I'll get away sooner or later?and I'll make you sorry you ever met me. I'll?"
		</p>
		<p>"ENOUGH!" The tall woman bellowed, as a firm shove set the blonde firmly on her back and kept her there. Randi had had enough. Her own temper was beginning to flare; and that was something a responsible Doctor should never let happen. She had to end this quickly. Steely blue eyes locked on to hostile green. "First of all," she began, through gritted teeth, "I'm
			<b>already</b> sorry that I met you. Second, I
			<b>tried</b> to get our rescue squad to come for you. But they were tied up on another accident site. Third, the nearest medical facility that could handle your extensive injuries is over thirty miles away. Road conditions being the way they are, we never would have made it. Fourth, I don't 'hope-to-gain'
			<b>anything</b> by keeping you here. If anything, I expect to lose quite a bit?my sanity, most of all. Now you don't have to like me?you don't have to like being stuck here with me. But you
			<b>do</b> have to quit fighting me, and allow me to help you heal. If you don't, then by god, I'll keep you so sedated you won't know your ass from your elbow the whole time you're here." Taking a deep breath, and removing her restraining hand from the younger woman's shoulder, she replaced the cover over the unresisting body. In a slightly gentler tone, she inquired, "which way is it going to be, Ms. Galagher?"
		</p>
		<p>Frustrated tears escaped tightly closed eyelids. "You win, Dr. Oakes," the blonde responded in a tight whisper. "For now."</p>
		<p>Randi sighed. Her temper had tucked tail and left her. Now she stood here feeling like five kinds of bully. Silence reigned for long moments, as doctor and patient each grappled with their own private demons. "I?um?I need to check a few things," the brunette offered, breaking the silence.</p>
		<p>Green eyes snapped open, filled with equal parts fear and defiance.</p>
		<p>"I just need to do a visual check of your bandages, to make sure your 'exertions' didn't undo them, or cause you to start bleeding again. Then I need to check your BP, heart rate, and pupils. It won't take long, Ms. Galagher, I promise. Then I'll leave you alone so you can get some more rest."</p>
		<p>The blonde pondered this for all of twenty seconds,
			<i> "the sooner she gets this over with, the sooner she'll leave you alone," </i>before nodding her acceptance.
		</p>
		<p>The examination was proceeding smoothly, much to the writer's irritation. She wanted to find something wrong with the doctor's procedure?she
			<b>needed</b> to find something wrong. But the tall woman was being maddeningly efficient, and this frustrated the small woman to no end. Finally, the writer decided she would
			<b>make</b> something wrong.
		</p>
		<p>"Why am I naked?" the blonde inquired, knowing full well the obvious answer.</p>
		<p>"I had to cut off your clothes in order to do a thorough examination and treat all your injuries." If the tall woman was taken aback by the question, she didn't show it, as she shined a light into the smaller woman's eye.</p>
		<p>"Did you enjoy taking my clothes off?" the blonde inquired cattily. "Did you get a quick thrill having a woman laying there naked in front of you?"</p>
		<p>
			<i>Damned if you aren't some piece of work, </i>the doctor mused, as she checked the pupil of the other eye. Betraying no emotion, the brunette put her equipment away, and turning to face the irksome blonde, she crossed her arms and smirked.
		</p>
		<p>"You've been reading too many of your own books, Ms. Galagher. (A) I was too busy saving your life to ogle your?. Assets. (B) The sight of a broken and bloody body does not turn me on. It never has, and it never will. And (C)?" the tall woman quirked a mischievous eyebrow, "don't flatter yourself." With that, she calmly turned and left the room. Leaving the young blonde speechless, embarrassed, and thoroughly miffed.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Weeks?I've got to put up with this for weeks," the dark-haired woman huffed aloud, as she hefted the weighted barbell off her chest. "We'll kill each other," she continued through gritted teeth as corded muscles strained to raise the one-hundred-eighty pound barbell one more time. She had retreated to her well-equipped weight room to blow off the excessive steam that had built up during her time spent with the venomous writer. And now, two strenuous hours later, her high ire was reduced to fatalistic grumbling. Her silk boxer shorts and tank top were glued to her lanky frame by the sweat that liberally coated it, and her muscles ached from the extended workout she had put them through. With a final heave, she racked the barbell and slowly lifted her weary body from its prone position. Sitting on the half-bench, the dejected brunette ran her fingers through sweat-dampened hair.
			<i>You're getting a kick out of this, aren't you, Uncle Jake? Whenever I would get down in the dumps, or start feeling sorry for myself over one thing or another, you always told me that a good swift kick in the pants would straighten me out?and you'd be more than happy to provide it. </i>Randi chuckled at the memory of those 'swift kicks' being delivered in the form of a good lengthy tickling; followed by an extended cuddle in warm, strong arms.
			<i>Well, if this situation isn't a kick in the pants, I don't know what is, </i> the tall woman mused, as she exited the room."
			<i>But damned if I didn't like it better when you did it. </i>
