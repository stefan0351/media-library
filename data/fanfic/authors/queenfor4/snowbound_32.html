<!-- Snowbound \ Epilogue -->

<p>Randi laid her pen down and closed the bright orange folder that she was making notes in. Leaning back in the large, leather chair, she heaved a contented sigh as she let her eyes wander around the room. It contained the customary desk fronted by two rather bland chairs, file cabinets, bookshelves lined with medical reference materials and a surprisingly comfortable leather couch. As offices go, it wasn't very large, and it certainly could never be accused of being professionally opulent. But the name proudly displayed on the white, opaque glass of the door made the size and the plainness totally irrelevant.</p>
		<p><center><b> Dr. Randi C. Oakes, M.D P.C.</b></center></p>
		<p>Randi studied the name proudly displayed on the door and allowed a small, self-indulgent smile to shape her lips. <i>I never thought I'd see that, Uncle Jake. I never thought I'd even set foot back inside this hospital, let alone be practicing here again. But, then again, I'd never imagined meeting a little five-foot-four keg of dynamite that would drag my sorry butt out of the hole I had dug for it. </i> Randi shook her head as she reflected on the last few months. They had been a whirlwind of activity as Randi, with the gentle encouragement and support of the writer, emerged from her reclusive shell and allowed herself to reunite with the community and the friends she had left behind. Megan had also kept her word to her mother and publisher as an adorably shy, raven-haired beauty was introduced to a warmly welcoming mother and partner and, later, to a smugly happy publisher. <i>I'm glad we took the girls along. Charly got an absolute kick out of Xena. </i> But the beautiful, blonde writer hadn't stopped there ¾ no. Randi'd had one more hurdle yet to leap ¾ one that would be the hardest, but would have the most profound effect on the rest of Randi's life.</p>
		<p>And so, it was a highly reluctant and inwardly trembling woman who walked into Knox General Hospital to "visit" with friends and acquaintances, and a shell-shocked, but proud and happy, reinstated doctor who emerged. Looking back, the brunette couldn't help but shake her head at the small blonde's dogged determination that she just "drop in and say hi." <i>Some 'hi' that turned out to be, </i>the tall woman snorted. <i>That brat must have known they'd want me back. And bless her heart, she must have known how badly I needed to be back. I don't think I'll ever be able to repay her for all that she's given me, but I'm going to spend the rest of my life trying. </i></p>
		<p>Watery blue eyes tracked to the delicate, gold leaf, book frame that sat proudly her desk. Megan had presented it to her on the eve of their victorious visit to the hospital. On one side was a photograph of a wildly grinning Randi standing behind, and with her arms wrapped around, an equally happy Megan as they posed at the front entrance of Toby's store. And in the other frame was a small, beautiful poem that Megan swore just, somehow, happened when she was thinking of Randi one day. Deciding that she liked it and hoping that Randi would too, the writer took the poem and had it rewritten by a calligrapher on authentic, aged parchment and then placed it in the adjoining frame.</p>
		<blockquote><b>
		<p>Do you know what I see<br>When I look in your eyes?</p>
		<p>I see endless summer skies<br>And deep, peaceful lakes.</p>
		<p>I see gentle, moonlit nights<br>And the twinkling of a thousand stars.</p>
		<p>I see gentle passion<br>And fierce serenity.</p>
		<p>I see ancient wisdom<br>And childlike wonder.</p>
		<p>And when they look at me</p>
		<p>I see infinite patience<br>When I am most trying.</p>
		<p>I see boundless affection<br>When I am most undeserving.</p>
		<p>I see absolute warmth<br>When I am most cold.</p>
		<p>I see pure, abiding love<br>When I am most unexpecting.</p>
		<p>And best of all</p>
		<p>I see my home<br>When I am feeling most lost.</p>
		<p>I see everything I should be, could be and ever want to be<br>In your eyes.</p>
		<p>I see?</p>
		<p>Forever.</p>
		</b></blockquote>
		<p>Randi reflected on the day that she'd received it. To say that she'd liked it would be a gross understatement, and a tearful, joyful and exceptionally ardent doctor spent the rest of the day and most of the night expressing her appreciation in any and every way that she knew. <i>I can't believe she's never written poetry before. But that's what makes this all the more special. It's not just a poem, it's a?heartsong. </i>A delighted smile curled her lips. <i>And it was just for me! God, I miss you, baby. I hope you get back from your book signing tour soon. </i></p>
		<p>A knock on the door interrupted her wistful reverie as a cheerful, curly-haired young nurse bounced in, carrying a small, square package. "This just came for you, Dr. Oakes," she announced brightly. "I figured it might be something you were expecting, so I brought it right over."</p>
		<p>"Thanks, Ronny," the doctor called to the retreating nurse as she examined the return address on the label. <i>Hmm, Megan's publishing house. I'll bet I know what this is, </i>the tall woman grinned as she tore open the box. Randi tore off the final wrapping and surveyed the bold title of her writer's newest offering.</p>
		<p>"Deadly Medicine" A Samantha Steele mystery</p>
		<p><i>You knew I was gonna want to read this one, didn't you, you brat? </i> Randi recalled her surprise when, in the course of obtaining some medical advice for the plot of her new story, Megan revealed her intention to introduce a gay, female doctor who starts out assisting a reluctant Sam Steele and ends up becoming Sam's unofficial sidekick. Randi had expressed concerns over how this change would be received by the current readership, but the writer remained undeterred. Meg felt that she owed something to that class of people whom she'd vigorously maligned, and this was her way of repaying that debt. "You are going to tweak so many noses with this one, my love," the doctor speculated aloud.</p>
		<p>"True," a cheerful voice rang from the doorway. "But I might also un-tweak a few noses?and gain a new reader base in the bargain."</p>
		<p>Startled by the unexpected response, Randi looked up, a delighted smile lighting up her face as she beheld a flaxen-haired, green-eyed goddess lounging against the doorjamb. In less than a heartbeat, she was out from behind her desk and within arm's reach of her lover as the blonde entered the office and closed the door behind her.</p>
		<p>Megan let out a startled, delighted squeak as she was lifted in strong arms, twirled and then kissed absolutely senseless.</p>
		<p>After several long, luscious moments, the blonde was allowed to come up for air. "Good lord!" she gasped in glassy-eyed wonder. "I'm going to have to go on book tours more often."</p>
		<p>"Nuh,uh" the tall woman murmured between random, wispy pecks. "Just being you and loving me will get you these kinds of kisses any day, every day, for the rest of my life. I love you."</p>
		<p>Megan's throat burned against the joy-filled sob that begged to escape as she gazed into adoring, azure eyes. "I don't know what I've done to deserve you, Randi Oakes, but I hope I'll keep doing it. In this lifetime and every one that follows."</p>
		<p>"You will. It's in our contract," the brunette quipped, lightening the heavy emotional atmosphere. Randi straightened and assumed an officious air. "Small, beautiful, blonde bards must meet, hang around with, and eventually fall in love with tall, dark, guilt-stricken and dense warrior/healer types. It's on page sixty-seven, paragraph ten," the doctor finished with a satisfied grin.</p>
		<p>"Well, I guess we can't go against a contract then, can we?" the blonde surmised, green eyes twinkling merrily.</p>
		<p>"Nope."</p>
		<p>The two stood grinning at each other for a long moment before Randi spoke up. "So, I notice that your new character is also short, blonde and green-eyed," she observed wryly. "Is that contract gonna be amended to read 'small, beautiful, blonde bards/healers that meet, hang around with, and eventually fall in love with tall, dark, warrior/healer/detective types?'"</p>
		<p>"Hmm, I dunno," the blonde grinned mischievously. "I could make them <b>really?close?"friends"</b> and let the readers draw their own conclusions. Or," she chuckled at the narrow-eyed glare she was receiving, "let's just say it depends on the 'feedback' I get from certain loyal readers," she finished, smiling coquettishly.</p>
		<p>"Feedback, huh?"</p>
		<p>"Yup."</p>
		<p>Randi grasped the smaller hand and began backing up to the leather couch.</p>
		<p>"I can do feedback."</p>
