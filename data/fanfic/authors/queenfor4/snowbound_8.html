<!-- Snowbound \ Chapter Eight -->

<p>Something was smelling awfully good. Traveling through sleeping nostrils, down to a thoroughly empty stomach, causing it to grumble in protest of its current state. Bleary green eyes opened to long woodgrain paddles slowly revolving around a milkwhite globe. The eyes idly traveled across the ceiling and down walls that were papered with delicate floral designs. The blonde shifted her head to the right, continuing her perusal, and gasped when her curious green eyes collided with gentle brown ones.</p>
		<p>Randi was in the kitchen, sprinkling mint flakes into a pan of rapidly boiling chicken broth. Dipping a ladle into the fragrant liquid, she scooped some out and gently blew on the steaming contents before taking a taste.
			<i>Hmmm, not bad. </i> The tall woman's taste testing was interrupted by the click-clack of canine toenails on a linoleum floor. The midnight-hued German Shepard ambled into the kitchen and paused in front of the woman.
		</p>
		<p>"I take it she's awake, huh?"</p>
		<p>A brief 'urf' was her answer.</p>
		<p>Randi sighed and turned back to the stove. Picking up a small bowl, she ladled some broth into it and set it on a tray along with a slice of bread and a pitcher of water. Picking up the tray, she turned to her four-legged companion. "Well, here goes round two," she mumbled as she headed down the long hallway.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>"Well, hello there. Aren't you the pretty one," the blonde rasped to her small visitor, earning her a happy, full-body wiggle and spin from the little canine. "You're a little small to be a nurse, so I'm going to hazard a guess that you've been appointed to keep an eye on me for her." This earned the writer a brief, yodeling 'roof'and an upraised paw; bringing an amused smile to the young woman's face.</p>
		<p>"Actually, she appointed herself," came the voice from the doorway. "She seems to think that you could use the company, whether you're awake or not."</p>
		<p>The smile faded from the blonde's face as she looked up at the tall brunette standing in the doorway holding a large tray in her hands. "Well, I certainly prefer her company to?anyone else's," the blonde replied acidly.</p>
		<p>Randi chose to ignore the caustic comment. Striding into the room, she placed the tray on the dresser and looked down at the little dog that had come to greet her. The brunette dropped down to one knee and reached out, gently scratching behind a golden, triangular ear. "Good morning, little lady," she crooned to the little animal, who leaned blissfully into the tender touch. "You did a good job. Now, go get something to eat before your buddy hogs it all." Standing up, she chuckled as the little canine took her warning to heart and scampered out of the room. Stepping into the bathroom to quickly wash her hands, she came back out and addressed her patient, who had been observing her with a mixture of curiosity and pique.</p>
		<p>"And how is Ms. Galagher this morning?"</p>
		<p>"Ms. Galagher is thirsty, hungry, in pain, and has to use the restroom; but other than that, just dandy. Thank you for finally getting around to asking,
			<b>Dr.</b> Oakes," the blonde responded caustically.
		</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry," the Doctor responded sincerely as she approached the bed, "I didn't mean to ignore you. The writer was caught off guard by the gentle response, but didn't show it; choosing instead to remain silent.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Oooh, no catty comeback, color me happy, </i> the tall woman mused. "Well, Ms. Galagher, the good news is, we should be able to do something about all of your complaints. The bad news is, I'm going to have to change your bandages and check your vital signs first."
		</p>
		<p>The blonde woman tensed. "My
			<b>vital signs</b> are fine," she gritted. "My bandages are fine. Just let me have some water and maybe something for the pain, and I'll take care of the rest on my own."
		</p>
		<p>Randi took a deep breath. "Ms. Galagher, I understand this isn't easy for you, considering how you feel about 'my kind', but your first priority is to get better. And my first priority is to do everything in my power to make that happen. If I don't change your bandages, infection can, and will set in. If I don't monitor your signs, I will not know if something is wrong inside your body." Seeing the blonde's posture relax a little, Randi walked over and picked up the water cup. Returning to the bed, she placed the straw to the blonde's lips. "Remember," she cautioned, "small sips."</p>
		<p>Mindful of her last experience, the writer obeyed. Taking a few small sips, pausing, then taking a few more. Finally, having quenched her thirst for the moment, the writer released the straw. Looking up into patient blue eyes, she mumbled a 'thank you.'</p>
		<p>"You're welcome," the tall woman returned. "I need to go to the office to get fresh bandages and antiseptic and a bedpan. I'll be right back."</p>
		<p>"Excuse me?"</p>
		<p>Randi was halfway to the door when the icy question stopped her in her tracks.
			<i> "Oh, shit. I knew this was coming." </i> She turned and grimaced internally at the flushed and furious glare directed her way.
		</p>
		<p>"Did I hear you say 'bedpan'?</p>
		<p>"Uhm, yes."</p>
		<p>"You have
			<b>got</b> to be kidding."
		</p>
		<p>"Actually, no."</p>
		<p>"Well then, you're insane if you think I'm going to endure the humiliation of having you shove a bedpan under my bare ass every time I have to relieve myself." Using her good hand, she pulled back the blanket, keeping the sheet covering her body, tried to rise. "I've endured enough humiliation at your hands, 'Doctor', the bathroom is right?"</p>
		<p>"ALL RIGHT, HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!"</p>
		<p>The no nonsense tone in the tall woman's voice made the writer pause in her attempts to rise. She looked up as the brunette clenched her eyes and took a deep breath, as if mentally counting to ten, then strode back over to the bed. The smaller woman unconsciously pulled back as the taller woman squatted down so that she was at eye level. If the taller woman noticed, she didn't comment.</p>
		<p>"Look, Ms.Galagher," the doctor began, "I'm not going to say that I know how you feel, because I don't. But I
			<b>do</b> understand." Ignoring the blonde's skeptical snort, the doctor continued. "But there are some things you have to understand too. Your left leg is broken, a clean fracture of the Tibia, to be exact. Your right arm is broken as well. The Ulna was fractured severely enough to break through the skin. Your head impacted with something hard enough to result in a mild concussion, as well as a deep laceration that required several stitches. You have a severely bruised abdomen that was caused by your seatbelt doing its job."
		</p>
		<p>"Okay, I get the picture; I'm a fucking mess," the blonde snapped impatiently, "is there a point to this conversation?" The writer was unnerved by the doctor's close proximity; and she
			<b>really</b> had to go to the bathroom.
		</p>
		<p>"Yes, there is," the doctor answered patiently, "and I'm just about to make it. You need a cast on your leg and arm. But I don't have the material here for casts. The best I could do, was splint them and wrap them tightly. If you try to put any pressure on your leg, such as trying to walk to the bathroom, your leg will buckle, and you'll drop like a rock. The resulting damage from that fall will be worse than what you came in here with. That leaves us with only two options: I can catheterize you, which is, in my opinion,
			<b>not</b> an option, or we can use a bedpan."
		</p>
		<p>Randi's heart lurched at the defeated tears that now cascaded down the young woman's face. She always hated to see one of her patient's cry, and even though this woman looked at her as an enemy, it still pained her.</p>
		<p>"Hey," she offered gently, "it won't be that bad. You can pretty much remain covered. I'll elevate your upper body and your bad leg. You can use your good leg to lift yourself, while I slide the pan under you. Then I'll leave you alone for a few minutes, and, when you're finished, we can remove it the same way. How does that sound?"</p>
		<p>"Fine," the heartsick blond mumbled.</p>
		<p>"Great," the relieved doctor replied, as she stood up and hurried out of the room.</p>
		<p>"She's enjoying this," the writer rasped through her tears, to no one in particular. "I don't care how nice she acts. She's getting a perverse pleasure out of having me helpless and at her mercy. Her kind doesn't care about anyone else's pain. They only care about themselves."
			<i>Are you sure about that? </i> A small voice inside her asked. "Of course I'm sure," she mumbled aloud. "I'm living proof of that!"
			<i>Are you sure about that? </i>The small voice repeated, leaving the blonde frustrated and, for the first time in years, uncertain.
