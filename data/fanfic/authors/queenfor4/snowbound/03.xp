		<p>Charlotte Grayson was not a happy woman.</p>
		<p>It had been two weeks since she had brought her talented young client home. Twelve days of which the blonde had been on the move, racing from city to city on a self-imposed, non stop book-signing tour.</p>
		<p>"I've got obligations," the blonde insisted when she requested, no, demanded this schedule. "I lost two months sitting on my ass. If I don't make that up now, I never will."</p>
		<p>And off she went. Owning up to her 'obligations.'</p>
		<p>
			<i>"Bullshit! She's running. Running from that talk we were supposed to have. Running from whatever happened up on that damn mountain. Running from
				<b>herself</b>. Well that stops today, my friend. You didn't know I could cancel appearances that fast, did you? I hated to pull rank and drag you back here like that, but you left me no choice. Something happened between you and doctor Oakes and neither one of you will talk about it. But whatever it is, it's affecting you both.
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>Charlotte recalled a disturbing conversation she'd had last week.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Hello?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Dr. Oakes?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Yes. Who is this?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Dr. Oakes, my name is Charlotte Grayson. I'm Megan Galagher's publisher.</p>
		<p>
			<b>… "Is she…is everything all right?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Megan is fine, Dr. Oakes. Thank you for asking. Actually I'm just in the process of cutting you a check for your services in regard to my client, and I was just wondering if you would like to have a check sent to you, or would you like to have the amount wired directly to your bank account?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Mrs. Grayson, I've told Ms. Galagher and I'll tell you; I do not need, require, or desire any payment for my 'services.' If Ms. Galagher is so determined to write a check, then make it out to the Pediatric Aids Foundation. They need it a great deal more than I do."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"I see. Dr. Oakes, may I speak openly for a moment?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Please do."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Megan is, physically, doing quite well. And that is due in no small part to the excellent care she received from you. But something is troubling her, Dr. Oakes. Something she cannot, or will not, talk about. When I picked her up in Cutters Gap, I could tell right then that something was wrong. But she refused to talk about it at that time; promising that she would when we got back to New York. However, when we got back, she went directly to her apartment and stayed there for two days. Not communicating with anyone. The next thing I knew, she blew into my office insisting on an immediate whirlwind book signing tour. Stating that she needed to make up for the ones she missed while she was incapacitated. Needless to say, she got her way. I suppose that, as her publisher, I should be happy that she's back in the saddle, so to speak. But, as her friend, I'm concerned. She's changed, Dr. Oakes. There's an aura of gentle pain that surrounds her now; so profound that it would make a statue weep. Try as she might to disguise it, she cannot. Now, this was not the sense I got when I spoke to her on the phone two days prior to picking her up. At that time she was in fairly good spirits. Something happened in between those times, Dr. Oakes, and I'm dearly hoping that you can tell me what it was."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"I'm afraid I can't do that, Ms. Grayson. That is information that you'll have to get directly from Ms. Galagher. I admit to being surprised though, at your perception of sorrow from your client. I would have expected anger."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Why would you expect anger, Dr. Oakes?" Did something…did you…?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"No, Ms. Grayson, I would never violate my patient's trust like that."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Then what…?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"As I said, I can't go into that with you. Suffice it to say she is angry. And it's entirely my fault. My…failure. And I'm more sorry than I can ever express.</b>
		</p>
		<p>"You care for her, don't you?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Very much so. She's a special woman, Ms. Grayson. We didn't hit it off very well at first, as I'm sure you know. But in the time we spent together, I discovered that beneath the prickly exterior I first encountered, there was a sweet, warm, lovely young woman.</b>
		</p>
		<p>"And do you know why she has that 'prickly exterior'?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Yes I do. And it shames me to say that I am yet another who's let her down."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"I see. And you won't provide me any more detail than that?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"No ma'am, I'm sorry. Please, talk to her. It will not only answer your questions, but it may also help her if she gets it off her chest."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"I'll most certainly do that, Dr. Oakes. Before I go, are you sure you will not take any payment?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"I'm positive. As trite as it may sound, just having her here, and getting to know her was worth a great deal more than any money you could offer."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Very well, Doctor. Is there anything you would like me to tell her for you?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Tell her I…"</b> There was a weighty pause, then,
			<b>"no, there isn't."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Very well. Thank you again, Doctor Oakes…for everything."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"You're welcome."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"And, Doctor?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Yes?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Be well. Somehow I sense that my headstrong young client is not the only one in pain."</p>
		<p>A hoarsely whispered 'thank you' was all she heard before the click that ended the call.</p>
		<p>
			<i>"A disturbing but very informative phone call," </i> the older woman mused.
			<i> "Methinks the good doctor is smitten with the fair-haired young bard. Now the question or questions of the day are,</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>1) Does Megan know?</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>2) If she does know is that what she's angry or sad about?</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>3) Or is she completely unaware, and simply missing the new friend she had made. That would explain her melancholy. But that wouldn't explain why Dr. Oakes thinks she would be mad. Nor does is explain what I saw when we were leaving the store.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>"Or am I just a doddering old woman who's watched too many soap operas?" </i> the publisher chuckled to herself.
		</p>
		<p>Hearing a light tap on her door, she turned to find her Administrative Assistant's head poking in.</p>
		<p>"Ms. Galagher's here," the portly brunette announced softly, then, looking back over her shoulder, she added, "and she's not a happy camper."</p>
		<p>"Big surprise there," the older woman snorted. "Send her in and I'll build a little fire and roast her some marshmallows."</p>
		<p>"I'll send her in," the Admin snickered. "But I don't think you'll need to build a fire. Just hold them over her head for a few seconds." With that, she left.</p>
		<p>"Now," the older woman clapped her hands together and took her seat. "Let's see about getting some answers to those questions."</p>
		<p>No sooner had those words left her lips when her door flew open and in walked one livid writer.</p>
		<p>"All right, Charly, what in the hell's going on here?" she barked.</p>
		<p>"Hello Megan. I'm fine, thank you for asking," she replied, keeping her voice deliberately calm. "And what do you mean, what's going on here?"</p>
		<p>"You know goddamn well what I mean!" the blonde spat, slamming both palms on the desk. "You canceled my signing appearances and sent orders that I had to return immediately to see you. I don't know what in the hell you're playing at, Charly, but I'm not in the mood."</p>
		<p>"Are you quite finished?" the older woman inquired calmly.</p>
		<p>"No, I'm…"</p>
		<p>"Oh yes, you are," the older growled, rising from her chair and, at 6'2", towering over her petite client. "You are going to calm down, sit down, and stop behaving like a spoiled two-year-old. Because if you don't you're gonna find yourself signing books in places like Bumfuck Arkansas from now until the end of your contract."</p>
		<p>"You wouldn't," the blonde squeaked, goggle-eyed.</p>
		<p>The older woman leaned forward until she was just about nose-to-nose with her client. "Try me, little girl."</p>
		<p>The publisher's face was a study in steely determination and the blonde knew, without a doubt the she could, and indeed would, do exactly what she had threatened.</p>
		<p>With her high fury properly deflated, the writer meekly lowered herself into a chair. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. When she opened them again, her publisher friend was once again seated, a benign smile playing across her lips.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, Charly."</p>
		<p>"It's all right, hon."</p>
		<p>"No, it's not," the blonde replied sheepishly. "I acted like an ass."</p>
		<p>"No, like a two-year-old," the publisher contradicted with an amused grin.</p>
		<p>The blonde blushed prettily. "Touché." Then sobering, she added, "I don't know what's gotten into me lately. I seem to be snapping at a lot of people."</p>
		<p>"Hmm," the older woman agreed. "Either snapping at them…or avoiding them altogether."</p>
		<p>The blonde blinked owlishly, her mouth opened, as if to refute, then snapped shut.</p>
		<p>"It seems you've been avoiding everyone that knows you." The publisher snorted, "Hell, even lover boy called here bitching. It seems he's been trying to get a hold of you, but you're never home and won't return his calls. Of course I won't fault you for that," the older woman grinned devilishly, then sobered. "You can't keep running forever, honey."</p>
		<p>"I'm not running," the blonde returned weakly, unable to meet the older woman's eyes.</p>
		<p>"Yes, you are…and you know it," the older woman got up and walked around the desk. Sitting in the chair next to her friend, she reached over and cupped her chin, raising the bowed head until shuttered green eyes met hers. "You haven't been the same since you left Cutters Gap. Something happened between you and the doctor, Megan, and I'd like to know what it was. Because whatever it was, it's hurt both of you."</p>
		<p>Megan pulled from the hand that cupped her chin, once again avoiding the older woman's penetrating gaze.</p>
		<p>"What makes you think something happened?"</p>
		<p>"Because you looked like hell when I picked you up Sunday, which is quite different from how I pictured you when I talked to you Friday night. Because the
			<b>Randi</b> you talked about Friday night, suddenly became
			<b>Dr. Oakes</b> again Sunday afternoon. Because the young woman who propelled herself into the car and attached herself to me like her life depended on it fairly vibrated with extreme angst. And finally, because that same young woman, who's normally a pretty talkative sort, didn't part with even ten whole sentences on the entire trip back home." Charly reached over and gently clasped the writer's chin, an indulgent smile gracing her lips. "Now, I'm no Samantha Steele, but there are some clues that even I can catch."
		</p>
		<p>That earned her a small grin before she returned to studying her hands. "It's nothing really, Charly,"</p>
		<p>The older woman leaned back, spreading her arms in a 'so what' gesture. "If it's nothing, hon, then there's no harm in the telling now, is there?"</p>
		<p>The blonde looked up, a wry grin creasing her lips. "I'm not gonna get out of this, am I?"</p>
		<p>"Nope."</p>
		<p>"It's not real pretty."</p>
		<p>The older woman's smile faded somewhat. "All the more reason you should talk about it. Just answer me one question first," somber brown studied the younger woman's face intently. "Did she….do anything to…?"</p>
		<p>A guilty flush crept up her cheeks. "No, Charly," her voice was almost a whisper, "I did."</p>
		<p>The publisher leaned back.
			<i> "Whoa!" </i> Quickly recovering her composure, she rose from the desk.
		</p>
		<p>"Oookay, I think this is going to require a good, strong coffee."</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-One">
		<p>The publisher leaned back in her chair, her face an expressionless mask.</p>
		<p>"You slapped her?"</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"Said you hated her?"</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"Threw that girl's name in her face without having the slightest inkling of exactly who, or what she was?"</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"And all this because she cared enough to prevent your drunk, horny ass from making a mistake that you know you would have regretted the next day."</p>
		<p>Megan couldn't sink any lower in her chair. "Yes," was a hoarse whisper.</p>
		<p>"No wonder she was crying," the older woman mumbled, more to herself than her client.</p>
		<p>Green eyes widened in shock. "You saw…?"</p>
		<p>"That tall, dark haired woman sobbing into that old man's shoulder? Hell yes, I saw," the publisher returned, her tone reproachful. "And I wondered what that was all about." She shook her head sadly.</p>
		<p>"Now I know."</p>
		<p>"Not one of my finer achievements," the blonde confessed, shame coloring her tone.</p>
		<p>"Not by a long shot," the publisher barked a laugh, then sobered. "I'm disappointed in you, Megan. More than that, I'm angry. That woman took you in, healed you, gave you all the comfort and compassion she had to give and you pay her back with verbal
			<b>and</b> physical abuse." She looked at the blonde, who sat with head bowed, her face concealed by a curtain of fair hair. "That was wrong, Megan. So terribly wrong."
		</p>
		<p>"Don't you think I know that?" the writer answered, her voice cracking. "Do you think I'm proud of myself?" she continued, raising a tearstained face. "Do you think I spent those two days in my apartment gloating?"</p>
		<p>Startled by the anguish written across the younger woman's face, the publisher's anger vanished, to be replaced by concern as she moved from behind her desk to kneel beside her distraught friend.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"I know what I did was wrong. I know I hurt her," the blonde was fully sobbing now. "She was only doing what was best for me and I disparaged her for it. That woman was right; I'm not a nice person. I'm a bitch," she sobbed into the arms that were now wrapped around her. "Nothing but a cold hearted bitch. No wonder they all leave me. I'm sorry, Charly…so, so sorry."</p>
		<p>"No, baby, no," the older woman gently admonished. "You're not a bitch, little one, and nobody left because of you. Shhh, it's okay, baby…it's okay," she cooed, holding on tightly and letting the distressed writer release her pain.</p>
		<p>After several long moments, the raging sobs were finally reduced to intermittent hiccups and shaky sniffles. The publisher leaned back and grabbed some tissues from the ever-present box on her desk.</p>
		<p>"Are you okay now," she inquired as, with a mother's gentle touch, she dried the tearstreaked face.</p>
		<p>"I'm fine, Charly," the blonde answered with minimal conviction as she took the proffered tissue and blew her nose. "I've made a mess of things, Charly, and I don't know how to fix them. I want to call her and say I'm sorry, but she'd probably hang up on me."</p>
		<p>"Why would she do that, honey?"</p>
		<p>The blonde looked at her friend incredulously. "After what I've done? She probably hates my guts." Shame colored the young woman's face. "And I can't blame her, Charly…I hate me too," she finished hoarsely.</p>
		<p>"All right, enough of that," the older woman ordered crisply as she rose to her feet. Taking a position directly in front of the smaller woman, she leaned back against her desk and crossed her arms. "She doesn't hate you, Megan…she never did. Hell, as far as she's concerned, this whole thing is her fault."</p>
		<p>Megan's head snapped up and green eyes narrowed skeptically. "How do you know this?"</p>
		<p>The publisher shrugged, "I talked to her."</p>
		<p>"When?"</p>
		<p>"Last week."</p>
		<p>"She called you?"</p>
		<p>"No, actually I called her. I needed to know if she wanted her 'payment for services rendered' to be sent to her as a check, or deposited directly to her account." The older woman paused deliberately before adding, "And she refused payment, by the way."</p>
		<p>"Then you already knew what happened," the writer bristled, assuming, incorrectly, that the doctor had 'spilled her guts.'</p>
		<p>"No, dear, I didn't," the publisher returned gently, knowing the path her young friend's thoughts were taking. "I'll admit, I did ask her what had happened, but she refused to tell me; insisting that I should talk to you. The only thing she would commit to, however, was that it was her fault. Her…failure, as she put it."</p>
		<p>"Jesus, Charly, it wasn't her fault," the blonde cried, exasperated. "
			<b>She</b> didn't fail me…
			<b>I</b> failed me." The blonde slumped dejectedly in her seat. "What am I going to do, Charly? I need to talk to her. I need to apologize. But I'm scared. No matter what you say, she's got to be pissed at me. She won't want to hear from me."
		</p>
		<p>"No, dear," the publisher smiled patiently. "She isn't 'pissed' at you. The overwhelming feeling I got from talking to her is that she is simply hurt. I won't sugarcoat this for you," the older woman warned as she focused a no nonsense gaze on the younger woman's face. "She's no doubt hurt by your reaction to her well-intentioned refusal…especially the bit about Casey," she emphasized the last part, noting the guilty wince by the young woman. "But I think she also believes that her 'failure' has cost her a good friend." Intense brown eyes captured engrossed green ones. "Someone that she had come to care for a great deal."</p>
		<p>The publisher had to bite back a grin at the incredulous expression on the younger woman's face as the import of that last sentence became clear.</p>
		<p>"She cares for me?" the writer squeaked, hesitant to acknowledge the truth that her heart already knew.</p>
		<p>"Very much so. And I'm going to venture out on a limb here, and propose that she's not alone in that respect."</p>
		<p>"I don't know what you're talking about," the blonde mumbled, somewhat weakly. But from the coral flush that highlighted the younger woman's cheeks, and her sudden aversion to direct eye contact, the publisher knew she had struck a nerve. Encouraged by these signs, the older woman continued.</p>
		<p>"I think you have found that you also have feelings for the good doctor, and you have no idea how to handle it, so you figure that if you keep busy, keep
			<b>running</b>," she emphasized, "it'll go away. But it's not working is it?
		</p>
		<p>"No…it's…I…" the blonde floundered, wanting desperately to deny the truth of the older woman's observation, but finding she could not. "Dammit, Charly, I can't feel that way about her," she finally blurted.</p>
		<p>
			<i> "Here we go." </i> The older woman crossed her arms. "Why?"
		</p>
		<p>"Because it's wrong!"</p>
		<p>"Why?"</p>
		<p>"Because she's a woman."</p>
		<p>"So?"</p>
		<p>"Dammit!" the writer was getting frustrated. "It's not natural," she gritted.</p>
		<p>"Says who," the older woman challenged. "Since when is 'love' not natural?"</p>
		<p>Megan was looking at her like she had grown two more heads. "Charly, what are you saying?"</p>
		<p>Her gaze then turned flinty. "Are you…?"</p>
		<p>"No, Megan, I'm not. Though Gaia knows, sometimes I wish I were. The selection might be better," she muttered to herself. Then, bringing herself back to the original discussion, she continued. "And what I'm saying, my dear, is that you have been so tainted by your father's hateful bias and your mother's supposed betrayal that you're trying to close the door on what may be the best thing that ever happened to you." The older woman reached down and cupped the young woman's face in both palms, willing the soft green eyes to meet hers. And when they did, her heart hurt for the anguish and uncertainty that radiated from them. "Talk to her, sweet girl, let both of you heal each other for that weekend. And then, if nothing else, let her at least be your friend."</p>
		<p>"I don't know, Charly," her voice was breaking. "What if she hurts me too?" Gentle tears slid down the writer's face, gathering in the publisher's cupped hands. "I couldn't take that again," she finally sobbed.</p>
		<p>
			<i> "Now we're getting to the heart of the matter, aren't we, little one. You're not worried about the supposed 'unnaturalness,' you're scared of being abandoned again. This can't go on." </i>
		</p>
		<p>Arriving at a decision, she grabbed another tissue and dabbed the young woman's cheeks. "All right, dear heart," she announced briskly. "I need you to get a hold of yourself here. I have something I need to tell you and I need (a) your undivided attention, (b) your promise that you'll keep a lid on your temper and your mouth long enough to hear me out, and (c) that you will at least give some honest and sincere thought to what I'm going to eventually propose."</p>
		<p>Caught off guard by the statement, and the older woman's change in demeanor, the writer stared at her dumbly. "Charly, what…?" she sniffled.</p>
		<p>"Please, honey," the older woman insisted. "This is something we need to discuss…for your sake more than mine. But I need your promise to stick with me."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Warning bells were sounding left and right inside the younger woman's head, but she was intrigued by the older woman's announcement. She took a deep breath to gentle her still raw emotions.</p>
		<p>"All right. Go ahead."</p>
		<p>The older woman quirked an eyebrow.</p>
		<p>"All right, all right, I promise to behave," the younger woman huffed.</p>
		<p>The older woman paused, searching for a way to begin. Finally she settled on the most direct.</p>
		<p>"Your mother didn't abandon you."</p>
		<p>"Excuse me?" the younger woman's tone took on an immediate chill.</p>
		<p>"I said, your mother didn't abandon you. She left your father, but she didn't simply abandon you."</p>
		<p>"Than why didn't she write, or call, or try to see me? It may be just me, but when none of those things happen, I call that abandonment." She remarked caustically.</p>
		<p>"She tried, she…"</p>
		<p>"Bullshit!" the blonde cut her off. "She didn't try hard enough!" The blonde narrowed her gaze at the older woman. "How do you know any of this?"</p>
		<p>"I'll get to that later," the blonde opened her mouth to challenge, but Charly cut her off. "You gave your word, Meg. Now you just sit there and listen," the older woman commanded.</p>
		<p>The writer glared at her for a long moment before giving in. She sat back and folded her arms across her chest, looking for all the world like a petulant child. "Go ahead," she gritted.</p>
		<p>"As I was saying, she tried. She tried writing…all the letters were returned. She tried calling…your dad always told her you were 'unavailable.' She even tried a few times to visit you, but your father was always there to turn her away. After the third attempt, something happened, and she stopped trying to visit. And not too long after that, the calls and letters stopped too. But she never stopped thinking of you, Meg. Instead of writing letters, she began a diary of sorts. Writing down thoughts to you, and of you, in hopes that someday you would read them and know the truth…" the older woman stared deeply into wary green eyes. "…that she never, ever left you."</p>
		<p>The older paused, taking a sip of her now cool coffee, and watched the myriad of emotions that played on the young woman's face as she processed this new information.</p>
		<p>Megan was dumbstruck. Her mind and her heart were engaged in a furious battle of wills, one needing desperately to believe, and the other needing just as desperately to deny, for no other reason than to keep it's angry shield in place over that foolish, gullible heart.</p>
		<p>Finally, the persistent mind gained a small foothold. She leaned forward in the chair; small hands gripped the armrests white-knuckle tight. "How do you know any of this?" she rasped, her gaze hard and cold. "How do you know
			<b>anything</b> about
			<b>her</b>?"
		</p>
		<p>Now it was Charly's turn to be stunned.
			<i> "God, I don't think I've ever seen her this mad. Ah, well, nothing for it now." </i> Girding her mental loins, and keeping her voice deliberately gentle, she responded, "Because I've done something you've refused to do all these years, Meg. I talked to her." Raising a hand to arrest the younger woman's attempted outburst, she continued. "And more than that, I
			<b>listened</b>! I listened when she talked about why she left. I listened when she talked about the many times and ways she tried to contact you…and always failed. I listened to her, Meg, and I believed her."
		</p>
		<p>"Then you're a fool," the blonde bit out.</p>
		<p>"Perhaps I am," the older woman allowed. "But you'll be an even bigger fool if you don't at least entertain the possibility that what I'm telling you is the truth."</p>
		<p>"I thought you were my friend," the blonde muttered, her tone was both sad and bitter.</p>
		<p>"I am your friend, Meg," the older woman responded, ignoring the younger woman's sarcastic snort. "And that's why I'm telling you this. Because I can't just stand back anymore and let you keep on believing that, if you let yourself love someone, they're going to leave you."</p>
		<p>"You don't know what the fuck you're talking about," the blonde fired back heatedly. "I love Eric, and I'm not worried that he's going to leave."</p>
		<p>Now Charly snorted. "Give me a break, Megan! For all intents and purposes, Eric left a long time ago, and you didn't even bat an eyelash. Oh, you were irritated, when he didn't call or try to contact you, but that's about it. And love him? I don't think so. Eric was pretty to look at, and probably made a good bed warmer when you needed one, but you had about as much 'love' for him as I do for this cup of coffee." The older woman leaned forward, astute brown eyes pinning the younger woman in place. "Tell me I'm wrong, Megan," she challenged.</p>
		<p>Green and brown locked on each other for a long silent moment; neither one willing to look away, or even blink. For to do so would be tantamount to surrender, and neither woman was prepared to allow that.</p>
		<p>However, even in the most hard-fought battles, there can be only one victor.</p>
		<p>"I can't," she sighed, slumping dejectedly in her seat. "I can't tell you you're wrong…about any of it. Are you happy now?"</p>
		<p>"No. But I will be. And so will you. Talk to her, Megan."</p>
		<p>"Who?" asked warily.</p>
		<p>"Your mother."</p>
		<p>"No!"</p>
		<p>"Why on earth not?" the older woman barked, beginning to lose her patience. "Are you so comfortable in your animosity toward her that you're unwilling to entertain even the possibility that it may be</p>
		<p>misplaced?"</p>
		<p>"No…I…she," the blonde was stammering helplessly now. All her arguments were being shredded, her carefully built walls were being systematically decimated by the older woman's unrelenting onslaught. "Goddamit, Charly," she finally railed. "I won't let her hurt me again!"</p>
		<p>"What makes you think she will, baby?" the inquired gently, knowing her young friend was close to breaking down completely. "How do you know she's not telling the truth?"</p>
		<p>"And how do you know she is?" the younger woman returned hoarsely, on the verge of tears.</p>
		<p>Charly didn't answer. Instead she pulled open a desk drawer and reached in. Pulling out a small, weathered envelope, she reached over and gently placed it on the desk in front of the blonde.</p>
		<p>Watery green eyes glanced at the publisher briefly before tracking warily, hesitantly down to the item on the desk. The writer unconsciously held her breath as she reached over and plucked the envelope from the desk. The breath she was holding burst forth in a ragged sob as she laid eyes on the achingly familiar handwriting that listed her name, and the address where she lived those many years ago.</p>
		<p>"No, it can't be," came as a broken whisper.</p>
		<p>"Yes, it can be, sweetheart," the older woman cooed gently. "That was the first of many that would be sent…and returned, unopened."</p>
		<p>"How…" her voice hitched, "how do I know that? How do I know that this wasn't written last week, or last month?" she was reaching now.</p>
		<p>"C'mon, Megan, use your eyes," the older woman chastised. "Look at the postmark. And if that's not enough, look at the handwriting on the 'return to sender' notation. I'll bet even money you'll recognize that, just like you recognized your mother's handwriting."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Megan studied the faded ink symbol of the postmark, paying particular attention to the date. June 02, 1987. Exactly one day after coming home from school and finding her life forever changed. Her gaze then tracked to the terse three-word sentence scrawled across the front of the envelope. And she knew, without a doubt, whose hand wrote it.</p>
		<p>She cast a helpless glance to the publisher, then to the letter, then back to the publisher. Her lips moved, but no words came. Charly ached for the pain and confusion so clearly defined in those green eyes. "Open it, Meg," her own voice was close to breaking. "It may be twelve years later, but you still need to know what it says."</p>
		<p>With trembling hands, the young woman tore open the aged envelope and gingerly removed its contents. Unfolding the stiff, white paper, she read:</p>
		<i>
			<p>Dearest Megan</p>
			<p>There's so much I have to tell you, Meggie; so much I need to explain in order for you to understand. I don't believe I can cover it all in this one letter, nor shall I try. For that is something best discussed when I can talk to you face-to-face. Suffice it to say that I have been very lonely, Megan, for so very long. A large part of me believed that it would be this way for all my life. And because I had you, my beautiful, bright piece of heaven, I accepted that tenet. (what intelligent mother wouldn't?)</p>
			<p>But then I met Caitlin. And in her eyes, I saw so many things that I had never seen before. But most of all, I saw my future; a future that promised warmth, companionship, and most of all…love.</p>
			<p>I know you are probably thinking, 'what about Daddy?' All I can say to that, sweet girl, is that your father is a good man, and has been an efficient, provider for us all these years. But the things that I have wanted, no needed all these years are things that he has ever been unable to provide. If this explanation seems vague, I apologize. But he is your father, and I will not diminish him in your eyes. For it is not his fault that I wanted…more.</p>
			<p>I know it upsets you that I will not be there, but I want you to understand that
				<u> I am not leaving you!</u> I won't be home, that is true. But that doesn't mean that I won't be spending time with you, or that I won't continue to be the annoying
				<u>mother-hen</u> you have always accused me of being. What it does mean, my big girl, is that you are going to have to pick up after yourself, clean your own room, and, for heaven's sake, try to insert a few regular meals in that horrible junk food diet you're on.
			</p>
			<p>Caitlin and I are in the process of moving into a larger place together, and it will take us a little time to become settled. But once that happens, we would like very much if you would consider coming to visit. Be it for an hour, a day, weeks, or even years. There will be an extra bedroom in our home, and it will always be yours. That is, if you want it. For I will not force anything on you. In the meanwhile, I will continue to write and call as often as I can.</p>
			<p>I love you, Meggie, always remember that. I pray that you love me enough to try and understand. But whatever you do, please, do not blame Caitlin for this. She only opened a door; it was my decision to walk through it.</p>
			<p>Love always</p>
			<p>Mother.</p>
		</i>
		<p>Charlotte Grayson sat there silently and intently watching the range of emotions that swept across her friend's expressive face. There was some anger, to be sure. But there was also confusion, surprise, awe, and even some small bit of amusement. But the one expression that pleased the older woman most was the expression of childlike wonder that suffused her face even as the tears ran freely down her cheeks.</p>
		<p>"She…they…were going to have an extra room…just for me," she whispered, her voice tinged with awe. "She wanted me to come visit. Maybe even stay."</p>
		<p>"Yes," the older woman smiled knowingly.</p>
		<p>"She loved me."</p>
		<p>"Loves," the older woman corrected gently.</p>
		<p>"She wanted me."</p>
		<p>"She still does, Megan."</p>
		<p>"But, what happened? Why…" her voice trailed off, unable to finish for the burn in her throat.</p>
		<p>"That's something you need to ask her, honey. I've been privy to a few details, but not all. You would have a better understanding of the whole picture if you talk to her. And I beg you, sweet girl," the older woman implored gently, "please talk to her. Give her that chance. Give
			<b>yourself</b> that chance. Perhaps talking to her will serve two purposes; to heal a very old and painful wound, and perhaps provide some insight to your dilemma regarding Dr. Oakes," the older woman finished with a wry smile.
		</p>
		<p>The young woman nodded numbly as she gazed unseeingly at the pieces of paper in her hands. "Does she…does she still want to see me?"
			<i> "After what I did to her…said to her at daddy's funeral." </i>
		</p>
		<p>"With all her heart."</p>
		<p>The younger woman nodded again, acknowledging the sweet fluttering of her heart as she allowed herself to hope.
			<i> "Oh, god! Is it just that simple then? To banish the pain of those lonely years? No, it's not. It may not change anything. But we can at least try." </i>She took a deep, cleansing breath.
		</p>
		<p>"Can you give me her address?"</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-Two">
		<p>Megan sat in her chair, idly running her finger across the surface of the small, three-by-five inch Rolodex card, studying the address printed in Charly's bold, distinct style.</p>
		<p>Laura Holloway</p>
		<p>712 East Lancaster Street</p>
		<p>Conaway, NY 14102</p>
		<p>Tel: (716) 555-1202</p>
		<p> "Charly?"</p>
		<p>"Hmm?"</p>
		<p>"How long have you known - about her - about this?"</p>
		<p>Charly looked into the green eyes that studied her intently.
			<i>Oy! </i> She cleared her throat.
		</p>
		<p>"Almost three years. She contacted me shortly after your first book came out. Knowing of your history with her, and your feelings about her, I was reluctant to talk to her at first. But she was persistent, and finally I agreed to meet her for lunch one day. We talked for a very long time as she told me of her repeated attempts - and failures - to contact you. Like you, I didn't believe her at first.But she showed me a few things that supported her story, chief among them being her letters to you."</p>
		<p>The older woman shrugged nonchalantly. "She made a believer out of me."</p>
		<p>Hurt green eyes regarded the older woman. "Why did you wait til now to tell me? Why didn't you tell me back then?"</p>
		<p>The publisher met the hurt gaze with equanimity. "Were you ready to hear it back then? How far past 'I've talked to your mother' would I have gotten before you went ballistic and walked out of that door, never to return?"</p>
		<p>Whatever posture the young woman had disappeared as the truth of the publisher's statement hit home, and she slumped miserably in her chair. And Charly's heart went out to her once again.</p>
		<p>"But it was more than that, Meg," the publisher continued. "Your mother didn't want me to tell you. She said that you made your position quite clear at your father's funeral and, as much as it hurt, she would abide by that."</p>
		<p>Megan flushed guiltily at the memory of her actions at her father's funeral.
			<i>I wouldn't want to be with me after that, either. </i>But one question nagged at her.
		</p>
		<p>"Okay, I can understand her logic there," the blonde conceded warily, an ugly suspicion rearing it's head. "But if she didn't want to reconcile, what did she want?"</p>
		<p>Charly grinned as she expertly read the blonde's expression. "Yeah, I wondered about that too. And I asked her pretty much the same question." The older woman's gaze grew distant for a moment, and her smile became bittersweet. "To this day I remember the hurt in her eyes and the exact words of her reply. She just said, 'I don't want anything. I just want someone to talk to every now and then. Someone who can tell me how she's doing, what she's doing…if she's happy. I just need to know that she's okay.'" The publisher gave a helpless shrug. "How could I really say no to that, Meg?"</p>
		<p>The writer nodded absently, studying the card, thinking.</p>
		<p>Finally, she looked up. "I can keep these?" indicating the card and letter.</p>
		<p>"Of course."</p>
		<p>Placing the items in her purse, she rose from her chair. "You've given me a lot to think about, Charly. Thank you." With that she turned to leave.</p>
		<p>"You'll talk to her?" the older woman persisted.</p>
		<p>"We'll see," she answered with a small smile, then quickly raised her hand to forestall the protest that the older woman was preparing to offer. "Please, Charly. You've given me a lot to take in here. Give me some time to wrap my mind around it. Okay?"</p>
		<p>"All right," the publisher sighed, acknowledging the turmoil her friend must surely be feeling right now. "But will you call me soon?" the older woman pleaded. "
			<b>I</b> need to know that you're okay too."
		</p>
		<p>"I will, Charly. I promise," she returned with a sincere smile, then turned and left.</p>
		<p>"Dear lord," the publisher mumbled as she ran both hands through her hair. "Please let me have done the right thing here."</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Megan sat out on her balcony, watching the pink blush of dawn emerge from it's midnight womb. Sleep would have been a futile pursuit, so she hadn't bothered trying. She had too much on her mind. Charly had indeed given her a great deal to think about, but, to be fair, she had given her hope too.</p>
		<p>Hope perhaps, but not courage. Not enough courage to finish dialing the numbers to Randi's house.</p>
		<p>No matter how many times she picked up the phone and tried.</p>
		<p>She didn't even try to call her mother's house. No, that would have to be done in person.</p>
		<p>If she did it at all.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Can I do this? Can I afford not to? Is Charly right? Am I so comfortable in my enmity toward her that I'm willing to let it continue, knowing that it may be unfounded? Jesus, why am I even thinking about this? I've been pissed for years and blaming her for it. Hurting because I thought she didn't love me. And now I have a chance to lose that hurt, and I have to think about it? Bullshit! Grow up, Megan. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Her mind made up, Megan rose from her chair and headed toward her room.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>
			<i>Okay…708, 710, 712. Oh, God. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Megan cruised slowly down the picturesque, tree-lined street and pulled quickly to the curb when she spotted the large, elegantly curved numbers she was looking for above the door. It was a small, single-level home. Now she sat staring at the neatly manicured lawn, overlooked by a large picture window that was framed on either side with tall, wide rose bushes, currently enjoying their long, winter slumber.
			<i>C'mon, Meg, you can do this. You didn't drive three hours outside the city just to chicken out now, </i>her little Charly voice chastised. "I'm not chickening out," the blonde protested aloud. "I'm just…preparing," she finished lamely.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Uh-huh, </i> little Charly drawled skeptically.
			<i>Get out there…chicken! </i>
		</p>
		<p>Heaving a resigned sigh, the writer opened the car door and exited. Closing the door, she stood beside the vehicle and breathed deeply of the crisp, cold air and noted absently the clean, dry streets.
			<i>Thank God it's only been cold in these parts so far. I don't think I want to see any more snow again for quite a while. </i>
		</p>
		<p>And she felt her heart clench at the memory of blue eyes and raven hair.</p>
		<p>Tucking that image away for another time, she strode resolutely across the street and up the short cement walkway.</p>
		<p>Standing in front of the door, the writer paused, praying desperately for the rioting butterflies in her belly to lose some steam.</p>
		<p>Finally, a trembling finger pressed the doorbell button.</p>
		<p>The writer held her breath as the door opened to reveal a smiling, petite, auburn-haired woman about the same height as herself.</p>
		<p>And watched as the smile faded, as pink cheeks became drained of all color, and bright, hazel eyes quickly filled.</p>
		<p>"Meggie?" A hoarse, ragged whisper.</p>
		<p>"Hello, Mother."</p>
		<p>Megan had pictured several different scenarios for this moment, but none of them required her to lunge across the doorway and catch her mother before she hit the floor.</p>
		<p>However, that was exactly what happened, as Laura Holloway's knees turned to gelatin.</p>
		<p>Megan yelped a startled "No" as she leaped across the doorway and caught the swooning woman in her arms, gently easing her down to the floor.
			<i>Great going, lamebrain. Make her die from a heart attack before you get the first chance to talk to her. </i>
		</p>
		<p>The writer's self-chastisement was cut short by the panicked yell from behind her.</p>
		<p>"Laura!"</p>
		<p>Megan swiveled her head just in time to see the solid, well-proportioned body of the tai chi master slide to her knees beside them. Dark blue eyes widened in recognition before darting down to the dazed figure of her lover. Assuring herself that her lover was okay, Caitlin looked back to the still kneeling blonde.</p>
		<p>"Megan," her greeting was cordial, but wary.</p>
		<p>
			<i>You think I'm going to hurt her again, don't you? </i> "Hello, Cait," the blonde smiled gently. "Will you help me get her up to the couch?"
		</p>
		<p>Caitlin gave a small nod, and both women lifted the dazed woman and led her to the couch.</p>
		<p>Once Laura was seated, Caitlin backed off to observe mother and daughter.</p>
		<p>Megan sat next to her mother, her hand held in a vise-like grip as watery eyes devoured every inch of her face, as if trying to convince herself that her child was really there.</p>
		<p>Megan looked deeply into beautiful hazel eyes that she thought she would never see again, and saw every bit of the pain and loneliness she had experienced over the years reflected in those blue-green depths.
			<i>God help me, she
				<b>did</b> care!
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>Megan felt her own eyes burn and begin to fill as she reached a trembling hand to cup a pale cheek.</p>
		<p>"Let's try this again," she smiled tenderly, her voice cracking. "Hello, Mother."</p>
		<p>And found her arms filled with a sobbing, warm, soft body that she missed terribly for so many years.</p>
		<p>Tears ran unbidden down the blonde's face as she held tightly to the weeping woman. Megan chanced to look over at the intense, dark eyes of her mother's mate,</p>
		<p>And was surprised to see that they too glistened.</p>
		<p>Royal blue met tearful green for a long moment before Caitlin offered a sincere smile and small nod before silently exiting the room.</p>
		<p>And a large, lonely piece of the small writer's heart finally found its way home.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-Three">
		<p>Megan sat staring dazedly at the dozens of small envelopes that lay in her lap, each one bearing her name and address. And each one bearing the tersely worded command,
			<b>Return to Sender!</b> Some of them even contained the added,
			<b>Addressee Deceased.</b> Megan questioned this addition.
		</p>
		<p>"Mother, why did he put that on there?"</p>
		<p>Laura sighed and shook her head. "That was his way of telling me that you were dead to me."</p>
		<p>Megan blanched at that revelation, but said nothing. She gazed thoughtfully at the letters in her lap, then turned her eyes back to her mother.</p>
		<p>"There's something I have to know," she stated carefully. At her mother's "go ahead" expression, she continued. "Charly said that you had tried to come and see me a couple of times and were turned away."</p>
		<p>Laura paled. She knew what was coming next and dreaded it. "That's true."</p>
		<p>"She also said that after one of your visits, something happened and you stopped trying. I'd like to know what that 'something' was, Mother." She searched the older woman's face. "I need to know."</p>
		<p>Laura closed her eyes and took a deep breath, trying to gather the courage she knew it was going to take. Finally, she girded her mental loins and began.</p>
		<p>"On my third attempt to see you, your father and I got into a terrible shouting match. The end result being my vow to go to court and sue for custody of you. His only reply was, 'We'll see about that.'"</p>
		<p>Laura looked down at her hands, which had unconsciously clenched into fists at the memory of what came next. "Two days later, after closing the studio for the night, Caitlin was attacked. She was beaten terribly, cut viciously and almost raped. But a couple who happened to be nearby managed to scare the attackers off and call the police. That nice young couple followed her to the hospital and called me to let me know what had happened. When I got to the hospital, they filled me in on what they saw and let me know that, if needed, they would go to court as witnesses on Cait's behalf. They provided pretty good descriptions of the attackers and what they saw, so you would think that it would've been pretty open and shut. The bastards would be caught and prosecuted, and justice would be served, right?" Laura snorted and angrily swiped at a tear that escaped her eye. "Don't kid yourself!"</p>
		<p>Cait chose this time to bring the seated women some iced tea, which was gratefully accepted. She knew that Laura had reached a difficult point in her narrative and decided to remain. Perching herself on the arm of the couch next to her lover, she offered the silent support of her presence.</p>
		<p>The action was not unnoticed by the young writer.
			<i>God! How many times has Randi done that for me? Not talking, not touching, just…being there. Even when I was still being a jerk. I'd be lying there sulking, and she'd be sitting there, in that huge, old chair, reading a book or staring at the stars. I thought she was just being annoying. But she was offering me comfort in the only way she could. Oh, Randi, I'm sorry. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Buoyed by her mate's presence, Laura continued her tale. "Once the doctors were finished, Cait was moved to a room, and I was allowed to sit with her. I was there when the police officer came to take her statement. I remember him sitting there, looking almost bored, while she poured out the details of that vicious assault. He took few if any notes. And when she was finished, he just got up and said 'We'll call you if we come up with something.' Something about the way he said that bothered me, so I asked him, 'You'll catch them, won't you?' He turned to me, and he had the absolute deadest look in his eyes, and he said, 'If they're smart, they've left the area for a while. We'll keep our eyes open, but there are a lot of decent people out there whose cases are more severe and take higher priority.' Cait didn't catch it, and I didn't say anything because I didn't wish to upset her, but something in the way he emphasized the word 'decent' made me think that there was more going on than a simple assault. My suspicions were confirmed the next day when I got a call from your father. He chose his words carefully, but let me know in no uncertain terms that, should I continue to try and remain in contact with you, or make any attempt to gain custody, Caitlin and I both could be subject to 'other random acts of violence.' He also made it clear that we would get no help from the police. He had many friends in the police department, and they were entirely sympathetic to his supposed plight. I'll admit, Megan, that scared me. But what frightened me more was his casual mention that you would be going off to college soon, and that college campuses could be 'dangerous places for pretty, young girls.'" Tears spilled freely down Laura's face as she recalled that conversation, and she reached up and grasped tightly the comforting hand that her lover placed on her shoulder. Guilt-ridden hazel eyes pierced deeply into Megan's own. "That finished it for me, Meggie. I caved," she whispered hoarsely. "I gave him what he wanted and let go of my baby. God forgive me, I didn't know what else to do."</p>
		<p>Megan's senses were reeling as she leapt up off the couch and fairly flew to the picture window on the other side of the room. She knew her father was stiff and distant, even more so after her mother left.</p>
		<p>But this?</p>
		<p>"No," she voiced less forcefully than she would have liked. "He wouldn't…he couldn't," she muttered, her mind refusing to accept such betrayal from a man whom she believed loved her, in spite of his aloof manner.</p>
		<p>"No!" she spun on her heel and glared at them. "He wouldn't do that! You're making this up so you can worm your way back into my life. But it's not gonna work," she spat as she made for the door,only to find her path blocked by the slightly taller, solidly built tai chi master.</p>
		<p>
			<i>God! I never even saw her move! </i> "I'm leaving," the blonde growled. "Get out of my way."
		</p>
		<p>"Not yet," the woman replied with calm intensity, feeling Laura move up behind her and place a calming hand on her back. She met Megan's glare with steely poise.</p>
		<p>"So you think everything your mother told you was a lie." It was more a statement than a question.</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"We made everything up, just to get back into your so called good graces."</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>"I was never attacked. We were never threatened."</p>
		<p>"Yes," was bitten out a third time, the writer's hard gaze never leaving the older woman's face.</p>
		<p>Never noticing that that Cait was unbuttoning her blouse.</p>
		<p>"Then this would be made up too, right?" With that, she pulled open her shirt.</p>
		<p>Without conscious thought, the writer's eyes flashed to the bare skin suddenly on display,and fixed on the long, angry, red lines that ran diagonally, one on each breast.</p>
		<p>They were the last things she saw before darkness claimed her.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>
			<i>Mmm, Windsong. </i> The fragrance of her mother's favorite cologne filled her somnolent senses. A small hand tenderly brushed the bangs on her forehead, and the writer's eyelids fluttered blissfully as she basked in the tender affection.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Wait a minute! Windsong? Mother? </i>
		</p>
		<p>"Mother, what…"</p>
		<p>"Shh, it's all right, baby," the older woman cooed.</p>
		<p>"What…where…this bed…how…" The writer sputtered, wholly frustrated with her inability to form complete questions.</p>
		<p>Laura bit back a smile at her adorably flustered child. "You fainted. You're in our room. In our bed.</p>
		<p>We carried you," she smiled, answering her daughter's incomplete questions in precise order.</p>
		<p>"Fainted?" The question died on her lips as the image of ugly, red scars marring pale skin flashed across her mind. "Oh, God, Cait! It's all true, isn't it," she groaned. "I was so sure you were lying. I didn't want to believe you. I'm sorry, Mama. I'm so sorry," she whimpered, ashamed.</p>
		<p>"Shh, it's okay, baby," the older woman reassured as she helped her daughter to an upright position. "You didn't know, and therefore your reaction to what we told you was perfectly normal." She emitted a chagrined chuckle. "If anything, I'm afraid it is I who should apologize. I never expected Cait to 'flash' you. But she was being rather protective of me and believed, at the time, that it would be the most expeditious way to convince you that I was telling the truth." Laura's expression became serious. "She never expected it to make you pass out, and she was horrified when you did so. She asked me to apologize for her, as she's quite unable to face you right now."</p>
		<p>Megan chuckled in spite of herself. "Well, it was effective, I'll give it that," she offered wryly, then sobered. "Tell her it's all right. Tell her
			<b>I'm</b> sorry," the younger woman murmured, fastening her eyes on hands that had begun their nervous habit of plucking at the spread that covered her legs. "I just…I couldn't accept that daddy could be that cruel, that…evil."
		</p>
		<p>Laura placed a gentle hand atop the fidgeting ones. "The actions were evil, honey, not the man."</p>
		<p>"But he…how could he," the younger woman began to protest, but was interrupted.</p>
		<p>"Let me try to explain," Laura offered. "Your father was a proud man. And very set in his…beliefs. I believe he would have accepted my leaving. He wouldn't have liked it…but he would have accepted it. But the fact that I left him for a
			<b>woman</b> was unacceptable. It was a blow to his pride, his ego, his beliefs, his very
			<b>manhood</b>." She shrugged helplessly. "I think something in him just…snapped. He wanted to hurt me, and he used you to accomplish that."
		</p>
		<p>"Yeah, but," Megan swiped angrily at the tears on her face. "He was hurting me too, goddammit! I was confused and missing you and hurting, and he was always…
			<b>busy</b>! What did I do to deserve that?"
		</p>
		<p>"Oh, honey, you didn't do anything," the older woman admonished gently, cupping her daughter's face. "I believe he was just so set in his ways and so bitter, that he just couldn't see what it was doing to you."</p>
		<p>"Couldn't see it or didn't give a damn?" the blonde retorted angrily. "If I remember correctly what you said earlier, he threatened to see me harmed too if you didn't stay away."</p>
		<p>Laura bit her lip and sighed. "I think," she paused, choosing her words carefully, "I
			<b>prefer</b> to think that that was an empty threat. But, at the time, I couldn't take the chance to test it."
		</p>
		<p>Megan nodded, scowling. "I never knew he could be so cold-hearted."</p>
		<p>"Anger and bitterness does horrible things to people, Meggie," the auburn-haired woman offered gently.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Tell me about it</i>, the blonde mused, reflecting on her own behavior and seeing, once again, the image of a beautiful, gentle doctor sobbing into a big man's shoulder.
			<i>I'm so sorry, Randi. Some way, somehow, I'll make it up to you…I promise. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Pushing that sad image away, the writer refocused on the present. One thing still bothered her. "Mother, how was Daddy always able to intercept my mail and be there to stop you when you came by? He couldn't be there all day, every day."</p>
		<p>The older woman quirked her lips wryly. "It wouldn't have been terribly difficult. He knew, from the note I left, that I would be writing to you. And, as he was on pretty good terms with our mailman, he likely arranged for any mail addressed to you to be held and given directly to him. And, as for my attempts to come and see you, I figure that's where his police friends came in handy. If they saw me in town, they would call him and let him know, and he would just go home and wait for me because he knew that would be the only reason I'd come around. I even went to your school, in hopes that I could meet with you when you got out. But I was approached by an officer, and he politely informed me that if I didn't leave, I'd be arrested for loitering." Laura gritted her teeth at the memory. "He said it would be a shame for you and your friends to watch me being led off in handcuffs." A single tear escaped closed eyes and fell onto small, clenched fists. "I couldn't win, Megan…I just couldn't win."</p>
		<p>Megan placed a sympathetic hand over her mother's clenched fists, her own eyes watering for the pain and frustration that must have haunted her mother for years. Something that the auburn haired woman said was sticking in her mind. "Mother, you said that, from your note, he knew you'd be writing to me. That doesn't make any sense. There was nothing in it about writing. There was no mention of me at all."</p>
		<p>Laura's brow furrowed in puzzlement. "Of course there was, dear. I told him to tell you that I loved you and was not leaving you. That I would sit down that very night and write a letter to you explaining why I had gone. Did you not read the note?"</p>
		<p>"Well, yeah. But there…" Megan halted, mid sentence, as a sudden thought hit her. "Mother, did you sign the note?"</p>
		<p>"Of course I did, dear. What…" her question was interrupted by her daughter's vehement curse.</p>
		<p>"Bastard!"</p>
		<p>"Megan?" The older woman was startled by the sudden invective. "Honey, what is it?"</p>
		<p>"I never saw that part of the note. He tore it off. I was so stunned and hurt that you had left, I never thought to question why it ended so abruptly, without your even signing your name." The young woman's chin trembled and tears spilled from her eyes. "I'm sorry, Mother. I should have asked questions, I should have known, I should have…"</p>
		<p>Megan never got to finish her self-condemnation as she was pulled into warm, familiar arms and held tightly while years of bitter loneliness were finally released in a storm of convulsive sobs.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Megan heaved a long, cleansing sigh against her mother's bosom. Her tears had long dried, and now she simply basked in the comforting haven of her mother's arms. A small part of her chided that she was a grown woman and needed to straighten up and act like one. But another part, the winning one, decided that she needed this; needed this solid, loving, healing connection. A conclusion that neither Megan nor Laura was willing to argue with.</p>
		<p>A timid knock called both women's attention to the open doorway, and they observed Cait standing there, her hands tucked deeply into the back pockets of her jeans, shifting from one foot to the other.</p>
		<p>"I, um…I fixed a light dinner," one hand came out of a pocket long enough to point a thumb toward the dining room before quickly returning to it's haven. "If you two are hungry or anything."</p>
		<p>Laura had to bite back a grin at how adorably shy her normally gregarious lover looked at that moment. She looked down at her daughter and noted the amused twinkle in those verdant orbs. A barely perceptible nod answered her unasked question, and she held out a welcoming hand.</p>
		<p>"C'mere, you bristly ol' she-bear. Our cub has something she wants to say to you."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Cait had that deer-caught-in-the-headlight look and briefly entertained the urge to flee. But one look at the warm regard in two remarkably similar pairs of eyes quelled that urge, and she slowly entered the room.</p>
		<p>The young blonde couldn't help but notice the term her mother had used.
			<i>Our cub? </i> Her mind rolled it around like a sweet treat.
			<i>
				<b>Our</b> cub…I think I like that.
			</i> She watched the brown-haired woman cross the room and sit lightly on the bed. Her mind turned once again to the hideous scars now concealed by the older woman's shirt, and her good mood evaporated under a wave of guilt.
			<i>He did that because of me. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Cait approached the bed and sat gingerly on the edge. Looking into her lover's eyes, she saw a peace and contentment in those hazel depths that had not been there in a very long time. Oh, they had had a very loving and fulfilling life together, but Laura never stopped aching over her lost child. And in her deepest heart, Caitlin never stopped blaming herself for that loss.</p>
		<p>But now mother and child had reunited, and the rapt expressions on both faces invoked a giddiness in her own heart that would linger for quite a while.</p>
		<p>Her delighted musing was interrupted by a shy voice.</p>
		<p>"Um, Cait?"</p>
		<p>Warm, deep blue eyes shifted to the young woman. "Yes, Megan?"</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry."</p>
		<p>Chestnut eyebrows furrowed in bafflement. "Why…whatever for?"</p>
		<p>Contrite green eyes met hers. "For what he…for what happened to you."</p>
		<p>"Aw, Meg, no. You had nothing to do with that. That wasn't your fault in any way."</p>
		<p>"But it was because of me," the blonde protested meekly.</p>
		<p>"No, hon. You were a convenient excuse for evil-minded people to do evil things. You were a victim, Meg, a truer victim than any of us. Your mother, your father, me…we all made choices, and we suffered the consequences of those choices. But you ¾ you were given no choices. You were forced by lies, deceit and selfishness to spend the most crucial years of your life alone, lonely and hurting, without ever knowing why." Cait reached over and gently grasped the younger woman's hand. "And for that, little one,
			<b>I'm</b> sorry."
		</p>
		<p>Megan felt the now-too-familiar burn of tears.
			<i>She knows</i>, her heart cried with awe-filled wonder. In one simple statement, this woman, this virtual stranger laid bare the pain of the last twelve years, and, in doing so, showed a depth of compassion and understanding that the young blonde had seen in only one other person. Returning the clasp with a firm one of her own, the writer pushed back the tears and smiled at her mother's partner. "Thank you, Cait…very much." Then, looking at her mother, she added, "And thank you for being there for Mom all these years."
		</p>
		<p>Deep blue eyes gazed lovingly into hazel ones. "It's been my pleasure." Looking back to the blonde, she sobered. "I wish we could have been there for you."</p>
		<p>Megan's smile faltered slightly as she swallowed against the lump in her throat. "So do I," she responded sincerely.</p>
		<p>Laura felt an intense wave of contentment wash over her as she watched the gentle interaction between the two most important people in her life.
			<i>You didn't win, Peter. It may have taken a few years, but I've got my baby back. And I'll never let her go again. </i>
		</p>
		<p>"Did somebody say something about food?"</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-Four">
		<p>Megan navigated the busy evening streets with the ease of one long accustomed to city traffic. Her body was fully in tune with the task at hand, but her mind was in another place altogether. Her reunion with her mother was everything she hoped for and nothing like she expected. Oh, there was a rough spot or two, but the end result was…</p>
		<p>Sweet.</p>
		<p>And Cait was an added bonus.</p>
		<p>She expected a cautious relationship at best with the sturdy, somewhat-stoic woman ... a wary, semi-tolerance between the two of them as they grudgingly shared the attention of the petite, hazel-eyed woman.</p>
		<p>
			<i>God, was I ever wrong! She's generous…and gentle…and funny. She treats me like a favorite niece. I think I would have had fun growing up with her around.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>And that's another thing!</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>I thought I'd be uncomfortable being around them as a 'couple,' but I wasn't. They were kind to each other ... playful, affectionate. All the things I never saw between Mother and Daddy. I could
				<b> feel</b> the love between them. And what makes it even better is that it wasn't exclusive; they pulled me right in there with them.
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>Quite unbidden, her thoughts turned once again to a certain blue-eyed beauty.
			<i>Is that what it could be like with Randi? I know Charly's right, and that Randi cares for me. But is it as a friend, or…</i>
		</p>
		<p>Megan gasped involuntarily as realization hit her right between the eyes.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>
			<i>Cait! The look in her eyes every time she looked at mother. That's the same look Randi would get when she looked at me! I never saw it. I was so busy being a bitch over the love I thought I lost, that I never saw the love that was right there in front of me. </i>Megan wanted to pound her head against the steering wheel.
			<i> Jesus, I'm an idiot! </i>
		</p>
		<p>Megan stole a glance at her watch as, with a push of the button on the device attached to her windshield, she activated the security gate of the underground-parking garage for her apartment complex.
			<i>Ten-thirty. That shouldn't be too late to call her. Oh, God, what am I going to say? 'Hi, Randi…I'm a jerk…I think I love you. But, just to be sure, can I come back up there, and we can try that dancing and kissing thing again?' </i> The blonde turned her car off and shook her head at the sheer silliness of that line.
			<i> Oh, yeah, that'd go over well. The first thing I need to do is say I'm sorry and then see what happens from there. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Satisfied with that course of action, the blonde emerged from her car and activated the alarm, tucking her keys and cell phone in the pockets of her light winter jacket. Megan's step was light as she strolled to the elevator, her thoughts so focused on blue eyes and midnight-kissed hair that she never realized she wasn't alone.</p>
		<p>Not until she heard him.</p>
		<p>"Well, well, well. So you haven't dropped off the face of the earth after all."'</p>
		<p>Megan let out an involuntary squawk as she spun around to face the speaker.</p>
		<p>"God, Eric. You scared the shit out of me," the blonde scolded.</p>
		<p>Eric was leaning casually against one of the massive stone columns that riddled the underground parking garage. Dressed in form-fitting black jeans, tan polo shirt and charcoal Hush Puppies, he looked every bit the all-American boy next door.</p>
		<p>"Sorry about that," he apologized insincerely. "But it seems that the only way to talk to you is to sneak up on you."</p>
		<p>"You had plenty of chances to talk to me while I was recovering at Randi's house."</p>
		<p>Eric shrugged and grinned contritely. "I had some old friends come into town. I got caught up hanging with them."</p>
		<p>"Uh-huh. So 'caught up' that you couldn't return my calls…even to see how I was doing." It was more a statement than a question.</p>
		<p>The sandy blonde-haired man shrugged away from the column and sauntered toward the writer, employing, once again, the boyish charm and sensual charisma that had always worked on her in the past. "What can I say, sweetheart? I'm a scoundrel." He moved in close to the young woman who maintained a stiff reserve and stroked her cheek with a crooked finger. "A scoundrel who's really missed you," he purred.</p>
		<p>"You missed my money is more like it," she replied coolly, stepping back to put some distance between them.</p>
		<p>Eric stiffened momentarily at the truth of her observation before plastering on a rakish smile as he closed the distance between them again. "That's not true, sweetheart. I've missed your smile, your laugh, your sweet voice." He leaned in, nuzzling her ear with his nose and taking a deep breath. "I've really missed your sweet, sexy perfume," he murmured throatily.</p>
		<p>"Mmm," she hummed. "I don't see how. Your clothes reek of it." the blonde bit out, pushing him away. "The only problem is, I wear Opium, you shit, not Obsession! Get the hell out of here, Eric. The bank, as well as the bed-and-breakfast, is closed." With that, she turned and headed toward the elevator.</p>
		<p>The realization that he had lost his meal ticket hit home. "You bitch," was snarled as he lunged after the retreating blonde.</p>
		<p>Megan had no time to react before her arm was grabbed in an iron grip and she was pulled backwards. The breath exploded from her lungs as she was slammed back against a dark sedan. Before she had a chance to gather her wits, he was on her. Grabbing a fistful of her hair, he yanked her head back viciously as his other hand pulled at the buttons on her shirt. "You fucking bitch," he snarled as he gave up on the buttons and ripped open her shirt. "You think you can use me as your trophy boy and fuck buddy for months, and then just blow me off? Think again, whore!"</p>
		<p>Megan's shock and disorientation were fading rapidly, being replaced by anger and outright fury. "Fuck buddy, my ass! You weren't even that good," she snarled as one hand came up and raked his face with sharp, short nails, while the other slammed into his chest and shoved, propelling him away from her.</p>
		<p>As Eric stumbled backwards, clutching his face, the frantic writer made a dash for the stairwell, hoping against hope that she could outrun him long enough to get to the lobby and find help.</p>
		<p>Her hopes were dashed as a hand grabbed the back of her jacket collar and jerked her backward forcefully, causing her to lose her footing and fall to the ground. She had no sooner hit the concrete deck than Eric was on her, straddling her thighs and pinning her down.</p>
		<p>Pain exploded across her face as Eric's half-closed fist connected with her cheek, stunning her and rendering her helpless as he continued to pummel her viciously about the head and chest.</p>
		<p>After a seeming eternity, the blows stopped, and Eric sat back panting heavily and staring at the battered woman beneath him. Megan's eyes were closed, but he could tell that she was still conscious, which suited him fine. He wanted her aware of what was coming next.</p>
		<p>"I know you're awake, Meg," he stated matter-of-factly as he unfastened the belt of her pants. "And that's good. I want you awake for this." Deft fingers unsnapped the button of her pants and pulled down the zipper. "The bank might be closed, you bitch, but I intend to make one last withdrawal," he hissed as he lifted a leg so he could pull down her pants.</p>
		<p>Megan lay dazed, her tenuous grasp on consciousness aided only by the intense, throbbing pain that radiated throughout her head and torso. Her limbs felt heavy and leaden; even the thought of moving hurt. Eric's voice echoed hollowly in her ears. She knew what he had in mind, and a small part of her wished she could finish passing out so that she wouldn't be awake for it.
			<i>Maybe this is what I deserve, </i>she thought dully as she felt her zipper being lowered.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Bullshit! This is not what you deserve! </i> The voices of Randi, Charly, Laura and Cait ... the ones that loved her ... thundered through her head, blasting through the cobwebs. Megan's eyes popped open as she felt the body above her shift and give her just enough room for…
		</p>
		<p>Eric screamed as a hard thigh slammed into his unprotected crotch and a small, powerful fist connected with his nose. He fell back, one hand clutching his freely bleeding nose, while the other one clutched his screaming groin.</p>
		<p>Megan looked around quickly, trying to get her bearings, and almost sobbed with relief as her eyes landed on her vehicle, less than ten feet away. She knew if she could make it to her car, she could lock herself in before he could get to her ... an advantage she would not have if she tried to use the stairs or the elevator.</p>
		<p>Reaching into her jacket pocket, she pulled out her keys and quickly pressed the button to disable the alarm and unlock the doors, then scrambled on hands and knees to the waiting vehicle.</p>
		<p>Upon reaching her car, Megan pulled open the door and launched herself inside, slamming the door behind her and locking it. Heaving a relieved sigh, the battered blonde slumped in the seat and let her swollen eyes slide close.
			<i>Just for a moment…I just need a moment. </i>
		</p>
		<p>She never got that moment. Megan yelped in alarm as the car rocked from the force of a body slamming against it. She stared at the bloody, wild-eyed face of her former lover as he furiously pulled on the door handle with one hand and pounded on her window with the other, all the while screaming invectives at her.</p>
		<p>The young woman could take no more; her fight-or-flight instincts were screaming at her, and the flight instinct won. Jamming her key in the ignition, she started the car, threw it into gear and pressed on the accelerator, flinching as Eric's fist impacted with the window one last time before the vehicle's momentum tore his hand from the door handle and sent him crashing to the ground.</p>
		<p>Megan refused to look back as she sped away from the scene of the attack. Her body was still in full flight mode as she activated the gate and exited the garage. Unsure of where she was going, she only knew that she had to get away ... far away. She knew she was a mess; three quarters of her face felt puffy, swollen and throbbed with pain. She could feel the hot stickiness of blood on her face, could taste it on her lips; every breath she took sent daggers of pain shooting through her chest and back. And she idly wondered why she didn't just pull over somewhere and let herself pass out.
			<i> Someone will find me eventually. </i>
		</p>
		<p>But something inside her vehemently rejected that option, as, prodded by sheer, unconscious instinct, she continued to drive, wholly unsure of where she was going, but certain that she had to get there.</p>
		<p>Before long, she found herself on the interstate headed out of New York.</p>
		<p>Realization finally set in.</p>
		<p>And swollen, cracked lips etched a small, knowing smile.</p>
		<p>Megan reached in her jacket pocket and extracted her cell phone.
			<i>God, I hope it didn't get broken in the scuffle. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Flipping it open, she breathed a silent thank you when the tiny screen and keypad came to neon-green life. Punching a button from the memory, she waited while the call connected.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-Five">
		<p>Charlotte Grayson looked up from the book she was reading when the phone rang. Glancing at her watch, she noted the time.
			<i>Eleven-forty? Who in the hell would be calling at this time? </i>Picking up the receiver, she answered in a cautious "Hello?"
		</p>
		<p>"Hi, Charly."</p>
		<p>Alarm bells sounded immediately. "Megan? Honey, what's wrong?"</p>
		<p>"What makes you think anything's wrong?" In spite of the situation, Megan couldn't help but be coy with her friend.</p>
		<p>"Honey, you never call me this late. What's going on? Did you talk to your mom? … Did she ..."</p>
		<p>"No. I went to see her." Megan smiled at that memory, then winced as her split lip reminded her of its condition. "It was better than I could have ever hoped for, Charly."</p>
		<p>"Then what ..."</p>
		<p>"When I got home, Eric was waiting for me in the garage." Megan heard the gasp on the other end and quickly continued, anxious to get it all out now. "Bottom line, he wanted back in, and I told him he was out ... permanently." Megan snorted. "He didn't like that very much. He grabbed me and threw me up against a car and tried to paw me, but I scratched his face and pushed him away. I tried to get away, but he grabbed me again and flung me to the ground. He sat on me ... and hit me ... a lot." The blonde's voice was a ragged whisper at this point ... one that the anxiety-ridden publisher had to strain to hear. "When he finished hitting me, he started to undo my pants; he was, um, he was going to…" Megan trailed off, her voice cracking right along with her composure as the images she struggled to suppress of those terrifying moments surged forward.</p>
		<p>"Oh, God, Megan, no," the publisher whispered hoarsely, her stomach twisting.</p>
		<p>The torment in her friend's voice forced the younger woman to regroup and continue. "No, Charly. It's okay, he didn't. I, ah ... kicked him and got him off me. Then I ran to my car and locked myself in. When he came after me again, I panicked and started the car and got the hell out of there."</p>
		<p>
			<i>Good for you, baby! </i> "Thank God," the publisher exclaimed. "Where are you now, honey? Did you call the police? Did you go to the hospital? Tell me where you are, and I'll come get you," the older woman rattled off as she went in search of her coat.
		</p>
		<p>"Charly, stand still a minute," the blonde commanded, biting back a smile at the knowledge that her friend was probably just about two steps away from bolting out the door. The sudden quiet at the other end told her that Charly had done what she asked. Sighing, she continued.</p>
		<p>"No, Charly, I didn't call the police. Not yet anyway," she added hastily before her friend went ballistic. "And, no, I'm not at the hospital, either. Hush a minute, Charly. Let me get this out. When I got out of the garage, I didn't stop. I didn't know where the hell I was going; I just wanted to get away."</p>
		<p>"Oookay, so…where exactly are you," the older woman drawled carefully, a feeling in her gut telling her that she wasn't going to like the answer.</p>
		<p>"Heh, believe it or not, Charly, I'm on the interstate heading out of state." Megan felt the explosion coming from the other woman and headed it off. "I'm going back, Charly. I've got to see her. I need ..." her voice broke, unable to continue ... unable to adequately describe the desperate, bone-deep need to be with the raven-haired beauty in spite, or perhaps because, of her current condition.</p>
		<p>Charlotte Grayson was hard put to keep the top of her head from blowing off when Megan revealed her location, but the young woman's plaintive reasoning struck a chord deep within. Like it or not, she understood the instinctual need to be with a loved one when a body is scared or hurting.
			<i>And I'm sure she's plenty of both right now. And that's the problem; just how badly is she hurt? Is she in danger of going into shock and passing out? Is she already in shock? Is she bleeding badly? How will I know? Shit! </i> Pushing back her alarm, the older woman used her most soothing tones.
		</p>
		<p>"It's okay, honey, I understand. But it's a long drive to Cutters Gap, and I don't know how badly hurt you are. Can't you pull in to a nearby town and let a doctor have a look at you, and then once you've been treated, you can continue on to her place?"</p>
		<p>The young woman bit her lip. "No, Charly, I don't want to stop anywhere."
			<i>If I do, I know they won't let me go. </i> "I just want to get there. I'm not that badly hurt, honestly." The deafening silence on the other end radiated disbelief. "Okay," she sighed, "I am kinda messed up, but I can't stop, Charly. I just can't." Tears blurred the white lines of the endless highway.
			<i> 'Cause I won't be able to start again. </i>
		</p>
		<p>"Megan, you need to be looked at," the older woman was nearly pleading.</p>
		<p>"Randi will take care of me, Charly."
			<i>I hope.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Hardheaded, stubborn, mule-brained. </i> "All right, fine," the older woman finally huffed. "At least let me call her and let her know you're coming, so she can keep an eye out for you."
		</p>
		<p>Megan let out a small chuckle and regretted it instantly as her bruised ribs made their presence known. "I don't think so, Charly. You'll scare the hell out of her by making her think I'm at death's door. Just let me ..." the blonde had to stop speaking and pull the phone away from her ear as a burst of pain lanced through her head and the road in front of her tilted crazily. She bit deeply into her already bleeding lip to stifle the groan that was bent on escaping.
			<i>Please, God, please…not yet. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Sucking in as deep a breath as her damaged ribs would allow, the young blonde willed the dizziness into submission and brought the phone back to her ear, wincing at Charly's frantic shouting. "Sorry about that. There was an accident scene with police that I had to get around," the writer lied smoothly. "Now, as I was saying, don't worry about calling her, Charly. Just let me do this my way…please," she added when she sensed the older woman preparing to argue.</p>
		<p>"Dammit, Meg. You're hurt," she argued desperately. "What if you get dizzy and pass out behind the wheel? I'll never forgive myself if anything happens to you and I could have prevented it," she finished, her voice breaking.</p>
		<p>"I love you too, Charly," the blonde smiled bittersweetly. "I'll be all right. I'm only a couple of hours from Cutters Gap now. Give me three hours. If you haven't heard from either me or Randi by then, you can call anybody you want to. Okay? … Please?"</p>
		<p>"Damn you, Megan Galagher," the publisher said hoarsely. "You'd better be okay, and you'd better call me."</p>
		<p>"I will, Charly, I promise."</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Randi sat propped up in bed, her computer in her lap, re-reading the same paragraph for the sixth time and sighing disgustedly, when, for the sixth time, her attention was diverted by one of the two animals either entering or leaving the room. "Look," she growled to the ebony canine that flopped on the floor beside the bed. "I'm trying to read here, and you guys are not helping any with your tag-team wandering."</p>
		<p>The black hound simply looked at her with studied indifference.</p>
		<p>"There's nobody out there; we've looked ... four times already! Now, I don't know if you guys are PMS'ing together, or if you're just spoiled from having uncle Toby visit. Either way, I don't care. But if you guys don't quit with the pacing in and out, you can spend the night in the kitchen." The brunette leaned over the bed, glaring into nonchalant blue eyes. "Ya got me?"</p>
		<p>The opportunity was just too good for the mischievous canine; she lunged forward and dragged a wet tongue up the woman's face from under her nose to her hairline, then quickly sauntered from the room, leaving the dark-haired woman furiously scrubbing her face in the sheets and muttering curses.</p>
		<p>Having sufficiently cleaned and dried her face, the doctor re-positioned herself on the bed and tried, once again, to involve herself with the story she was reading ... only to give up moments later when she realized that the dogs weren't the only ones distracted this evening. With a resigned sigh, she exited the disc she was reading from, removed it and shut down the laptop.</p>
		<p>Randi lay on her back with her hands clasped behind her head, patiently waiting for Morpheus to beckon and contemplating the last several weeks. They had been busy weeks, with Toby and Kate maintaining an almost-constant presence, no longer willing to let the young doctor bear her burden alone.
			<i> I guess I scared them that day Megan left. I scared me too. I couldn't take any more. </i>
		</p>
		<p>She remembered that day as if it were yesterday.</p>
		<p>Megan's caustic, unknowing barb about Casey was the final blow to the gentle doctor's already-battered psyche. She fled from the little store with every intention of never being seen again. She had one foot already in her Jeep when she heard the big man calling to her.</p>
		<p>When Toby approached her, he did so carefully, knowing the young woman was just this close to bolting and knowing, in the very core of his heart, that if he didn't stop her now, she would be lost to him forever. He searched his mind frantically for the right thing to say to the skittish beauty and could only think of one thing; reaching his hands out, palms upward, he searched liquid blue eyes.</p>
		<p>"I love you, princess. Don't leave me."</p>
		<p>It was exactly the right thing to say.</p>
		<p>Randi stepped away from the Jeep and hurled herself into his arms.</p>
		<p>Massive arms held firmly to the quaking body enclosed within them, keeping her back to the road so she would not see the limousine as it pulled away.</p>
		<p>After many long moments, anguish and exhaustion took their toll on the young woman, and long legs became rubbery. Without missing a beat, the big man bent slightly and scooped the younger woman up into his arms. Being too tired and heartsick to resist, Randi closed her eyes and nestled into the comforting warmth.</p>
		<p>Cradling the unresisting woman against his chest, he strode purposefully down the street to the small, red and white cottage that he and Kate called home.</p>
		<p>Having seen his approach from their kitchen window, a very concerned Kate had the front door open. Seeing the pale, tearstreaked face of the doctor, Kate's concern intensified. "Toby, what ..."</p>
		<p>"In a minute, Kate," he offered as they continued to the back of the house. "Let's get our girl into a bed first."</p>
		<p>Toby placed his precious burden on the bed and straightened. "I'll be right back," he offered, wagging a thick finger at her. "And don't you even
			<b>think</b> about moving from there, young lady," he warned sternly.
		</p>
		<p>As soon as her husband moved away from the bed, Kate made her way over and sat on the edge. Loving brown eyes studied the drawn, tearstained face worriedly.</p>
		<p>"Hi, Aunt Kate," the brunette offered a wan smile.</p>
		<p>"Can't leave you alone for a minute, can I," the older woman mock-scolded as she brushed gentle fingers through raven bangs. "What have you been doing to yourself, little one?"</p>
		<p>"It's…I…it's nothing," she sputtered, her meager grip on composure being lost to the warm, caring regard and tender touch of the woman who had been her surrogate mother for more than half her life. "I'm acting like a baby," she muttered, becoming disgusted with herself on yet another level.</p>
		<p>"I shouldn't ..."</p>
		<p>"Hush," Kate commanded gently. "You
			<b>are</b> a baby…
			<b>my</b> baby. And I absolutely cannot stand to see my baby hurting. Now, I've been patient; I've stood back and let you try and work through this thing with that sweet child. But something tells me that you've been handed a new heartache on top of that, and I refuse to stand back and let you deal with this alone anymore." A firm, callused hand tenderly cupped a tear-tracked cheek. "Talk to me, sweetheart…tell me," the older woman entreated.
		</p>
		<p>And Randi did. Minutes turned into hours as the brunette poured her heartache, her tears and herself into the loving embrace of the storekeeper's wife.</p>
		<p>Later that evening, Randi lay curled on her side, her head resting in Kate's lap, trying desperately to stay awake, but losing to the gentle fingers that combed through her hair.</p>
		<p>"You know that puts me to sleep," she mock complained.</p>
		<p>"Mm-hmm," the older woman rumbled softly. "And sleep is exactly what you need right now. Along with a few good meals and some major TLC ... which is just what you're going to get for at least a couple of days."</p>
		<p>"I can't. The dogs ..." she argued half-heartedly.</p>
		<p>"Will be just fine. Toby will see that they're looked after."</p>
		<p>The tall woman searched her mind for reasons why she could not stay ... and found none.</p>
		<p>And so she surrendered gratefully to the gentle ministrations, her blue eyes fluttering closed, her restive psyche reluctantly giving itself over to calm.</p>
		<p>But for one small, sad question that begged an answer.</p>
		<p>"Why do people leave me, Aunt Kate?"</p>
		<p>"Oh, honey, some people don't have a choice. You know that better than most. And others…well, I think it has more to do with personal demons than anything you've done."</p>
		<p>"I miss her, Aunt Kate."</p>
		<p>"I know you do, sweetheart."</p>
		<p>"I love her."</p>
		<p>"I know that too, baby." Kate continued to stroke the ebony hair. "You'll see her again. I truly believe that, one way or another, you'll see her again."</p>
		<p>"I hope so," the tall beauty mumbled drowsily as sleep claimed her.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Randi's smile was bittersweet as she recalled that conversation.
			<i>I'm still waiting, Aunt Kate. Bless your heart. You and Uncle Toby have been great these last few weeks, talking to me about Casey and trying to make me see that it wasn't my fault. You even tried to get me to talk to Amy. But I still can't face her…not yet. Still, I appreciate everything you've been trying to do. The tall woman snorted a laugh. Even all those silly 'chores' you and Toby would think up, just to keep me busy so I wouldn't be lonely or brood too much. I love you guys. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Randi was feeling the first fuzzy edges of sleep surround her when the doorbell rang.
			<i>What the hell? </i>
		</p>
		<p>Eschewing her robe and slippers, and clad only in her boxers and an old T-shirt that had been cut off at mid-torso, she padded down the hall to the front door and turned on the porch light as she opened the door.</p>
		<p>A startled gasp burst from her lips as she beheld the slim, compact figure that had haunted her dreams for months. Megan stood at the rail surrounding the porch, curiously facing the darkened woods instead of the front door where Randi stood.</p>
		<p>"Megan?" The tall woman moved to approach her visitor.</p>
		<p>"Randi, don't," the strawberry blonde called out, sensing the movement. "Please, just stay right there."</p>
		<p>Stung and confused, Randi complied anyway, and backed up into her doorway. "Megan, what ..."</p>
		<p>"Please, Randi. There's something I need to say, and I need you to just stand there for a moment and just listen."</p>
		<p>"But ..."</p>
		<p>"Please, Randi," the young woman's tone was husky and urgent.</p>
		<p>"Okay," the brunette reluctantly agreed. "I'll stay right here."</p>
		<p>"Thank you," the blonde whispered, taking a deep breath to gather courage, then gritting her teeth against the sharp, sudden pain as her bruised ribs announced their displeasure.</p>
		<p>"The first thing I need to do is say I'm sorry. I acted like a total shitheel before I left, and there was absolutely no reason for it."</p>
		<p>"I…disappointed you," the tall woman mumbled, still feeling the sting of that evening.</p>
		<p>"You protected me," the blonde retorted hotly, hating herself for the anguish and undeserved self-abasement that radiated from the woman behind her. "You prevented me from making a mistake that, as you predicted, I would have regretted in the morning. My behavior that night,
			<b>and</b> the following day, were inexcusable. Even so, I'm asking your forgiveness. If you don't…if you can't give it, I'll understand. I'll walk away and never bother you again." The writer bowed her head and fought the sobs that struggled to escape. Her post-fight adrenaline rush was fading, and the pain of her injuries was becoming unbearable. She needed to finish this and finish it quickly, while she still had the strength to walk away if Randi rejected her.
		</p>
		<p>Randi was plainly…stunned. The hot tears that gathered in her eyes as the writer spoke now trailed lazily down her cheeks as one of two very large stones was lifted from her heart. "There's nothing to forgive, Megan. Even if there were, I forgave you a long time ago."</p>
		<p>Megan felt a sweet pain invade her heart.
			<i>Of course you would. That's the beauty of you, Randi Oakes. </i> "Thank you," she whispered hoarsely as black spots danced before her eyes. She turned slowly, her tongue felt thick and a subtle roaring filled her ears. "That's good to hear…'cause I think I'm gonna need your hel ..." The word went unfinished as she tumbled headlong into oblivion.

	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-Six">
		<p>"No!" Randi yelped as she lunged to catch the smaller woman's body before it hit the wooden deck. and succeeding only partially, as, with one arm around the smaller woman's shoulders, she was forced to descend with the limp body.</p>
		<p>The raven-haired doctor hadn't gotten a good look at the blonde before she was forced to catch her, and subsequently hissed in horrified surprise when the writer's slack head fell back and her battered face was revealed.</p>
		<p>"Dear God, what happened to you?" the brunette whispered brokenly as she took in the bloody, bruised and swollen flesh that was three quarters of Megan's face. "Who did this to you, Megan…why?"</p>
		<p>Randi shivered as an unfamiliar rage seared through the pit of her belly, and in the depths of her soul, an ancient warrior screamed her displeasure to any who would hear.</p>
		<p>Pushing aside her emotions, the tall woman tucked her arm under the unconscious woman's knees and, gathering her close, rose and headed for the infirmary.</p>
		<p>Randi laid the unconscious woman down gently, her physician's mind automatically making observations and rattling off treatments and procedures as the tall doctor began the task of stripping and carefully examining her patient.</p>
		<p>The brunette froze as she reached Megan's pants and noticed their partially open state. Her heart hammered triple time against her chest as she considered the ugly implication.
			<i>Oh, God, please…no. </i> Randi ruthlessly pushed down her dread and continued her task, dismally mindful of the additional examination she would have to make.
		</p>
		<p>An hour and a half later, the doctor was gently swabbing away the traces of blood from the blonde's face and speaking gently to her, even though she was fairly certain the still-unconscious writer couldn't hear her. "It wasn't too bad, sweetheart," she murmured softly, oblivious to the endearment she'd uttered. "You just needed a few stitches to a cut on your temple and a couple to your split lip. Your nose was pretty bloody but, thankfully, it wasn't broken. Your ribs are bruised, and they're gonna be really sore for a few days, but nothing's broken."
			<i> You weren't raped either, love. And I thank God for that. </i>She laid down the stained gauze and tenderly brushed aside damp, blonde bangs. "You're gonna be really tender for a few days, but you're gonna be fine, Megan, just fine."
		</p>
		<p>"Course I am," the raspy voice mumbled, startling the tall woman. "I've got you taking care of me, don't I?" Puffy eyelids slid open and hazy green eyes focused on the beautifully sculpted features of the woman who, Megan was slowly coming to realize, owned her soul.</p>
		<p>"Hi there."</p>
		<p>"You scared me," the brunette accused, unable to conceal the tremulous tone in her voice.</p>
		<p>"I know. I'm sorry," the blonde returned contritely. "Couldn't be helped."</p>
		<p>"Who did this to you?" The brunette's tone was just shy of a growl.</p>
		<p>"My ex-boyfriend. Long story," the blonde supplied her sentences shortened by painful, throbbing lips and protesting ribs. She closed her eyes briefly to reign in the pain. Opening them again, she gasped at the glacial blue orbs that now beheld her.
			<i>Ooh, boy, Eric, I think you need to be really glad that you're not here right now. </i> She reached out and covered the hand that rested on the bed beside her. "It's all right," she reassured gently. "I'll tell you everything later. I promise. But right now, can you…ah…can you do me a favor?"
		</p>
		<p>"Anything," the doctor promised.</p>
		<p>"Can you call Charly for me? She knows what happened, and she knows I was on my way here. She was…um… she was worried that I wouldn't make it, and I promised her that one of us would call her. I think she's probably ready to call out the National Guard by now," the blonde quipped with a tiny smile.</p>
		<p>The brunette turned her hand palm up and gently squeezed the smaller hand. "I'll be right back."
			<i> I need to get a hold of myself anyway. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Megan watched the long, lean figure exit the room, craning her neck to let her eyes linger as long as they could. When Randi was finally out of sight, the small blonde let her head fall back onto the flimsy, generic "pillow" that doctors' offices always employed. Closing her eyes, she let a small, happy thought run it's tickling fingers across her heart.
			<i>She doesn't hate me. She doesn't hate me. She doesn't hate me. </i> Megan's eyes snapped open, as another thought demanded to be heard.
			<i> She called me sweetheart! I didn't imagine that…I know I didn't. </i> She closed her eyes again as a wave of giddy warmth slid through her being.
			<i>She called me sweetheart. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Megan was drawn out of her blissful reverie by the sound of Randi's voice as the tall woman entered the room, still talking on the phone.</p>
		<p>"Yes, ma'am," the doctor's tone was calm and reassuring as she addressed the person on the other end. "I'll see to it that she gets plenty of rest…even if I have to tie her to the bed," the doctor winked at the goggle-eyed blonde who was now blushing furiously. "Yes, ma'am," she responded to another unheard question. "She's right here; would you like to speak to her for a moment?"</p>
		<p>Randi held out the cordless phone. "Here you go. Not too long though," she counseled, "I want to give you something for the pain, and then get you into a regular bed so you can rest."</p>
		<p>Acceding to the doctor's wishes, Megan kept her conversation brief, promising that Charly and she would speak again in a day or so.</p>
		<p>As soon as Megan disconnected the call, Randi handed her two small, white tablets. "It's just Tylenol 3," the raven-haired woman volunteered. "It'll help with the pain and allow you to get some sleep."</p>
		<p>Megan smiled her thanks and popped the pills into her mouth, following up with careful sips from the cup of cool water that Randi held for her. When she was finished, Randi put the cup down. "I'm gonna go turn down the bed in
			<b>your</b> room," she announced with a teasing wink, referring to the room that the writer had spent copious amounts of time in, mere months ago.
		</p>
		<p>"Yeah, you do that, smartass," Megan snorted to the retreating brunette.</p>
		<p>Within moments, the doctor returned. "All set," she announced as she moved to the examining table and tucked one long arm beneath the blonde's knees and the other behind her shoulders, preparing to lift.</p>
		<p>"Randi! I'm too heavy," the blonde squawked as her backside left the bed, her arms instinctively circling the bronzed neck.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, right," the brunette snorted as she cradled her precious burden. "Either of the dogs is heavier than you. Now hush and enjoy the ride."</p>
		<p>The "ride" ended entirely too soon for the young blonde as she felt herself being lowered onto the cool softness of the bed. With grudging slowness, she removed her arms from around the smooth, strong neck and had to bite her lip to keep from crying at the loss of that wonderful warmth.</p>
		<p>The sentiment was shared by the quiet doctor, and she found herself wishing that the distance from the infirmary to this room were a little greater.
			<i> Like a mile or so, maybe. </i> Randi pulled the covers over the too-quiet blonde. Misinterpreting the distress on the younger woman's face, she leaned over and brushed back an unruly lock of fair hair. "You'll feel better soon, Meg. I promise," she whispered reassuringly.
		</p>
		<p>As she turned to go, a small hand darted out and captured hers. Randi turned back to the bed and cast a quizzical look at the reclining blonde.</p>
		<p>"Don't go." Megan's voice was ragged with emotion, her eyes a misty plea that Randi was helpless to deny as she allowed herself to be guided down to a sitting position next to the blonde.</p>
		<p>Ignoring the intense throbbing in her torso, Megan reached up and placed a trembling hand against the achingly soft cheek of her savior. Tears welled in her eyes at the wonder and adoration in the azure orbs that beheld her.</p>
		<p>"I've missed you," she whispered brokenly. "So very, very much."</p>
		<p>Randi's eyes fluttered closed; her heart reached out with gossamer fingers to gather in this moment and lock it away.
			<i> Forever. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Opening her eyes, she lightly grasped the hand on her cheek, turned her head and placed a feathery kiss on the soft palm. "I've missed you too, little bard," she murmured. "More than I can say."</p>
		<p>Megan bit back a sob. She knew that her injuries and her exhaustion were playing havoc with her emotions, leaving them too raw, too close to the surface.</p>
		<p>Knowing this, however, didn't change the way this woman, this sweet, gentle, beautiful woman, made her feel.</p>
		<p>Loved.</p>
		<p>Humbled.</p>
		<p>And very, very lucky.</p>
		<p>So rather than give in to the tears that her overstressed emotions demanded, the young woman chose to bury her face into the living, loving warmth of her doctor's shoulder and…</p>
		<p>Just absorb.</p>
		<p>Just feel.</p>
		<p>Just…be loved.</p>
		<p>Randi's lips curled into an indulgent smile as she felt the small blonde slide into the arms of Morpheus. Her sensible mind suggested she detach herself from the sleeping woman and allow her to rest in a position more conducive to healing.</p>
		<p>However.</p>
		<p>Her heart and her arms were having none of that. Randi looked down at the face that, even swollen and bruised, rendered her mindless with its innate, wholesome beauty.</p>
		<p>A face that, at this moment, radiated a childlike contentment so pure that it almost made her cry.</p>
		<p>
			<i>I put that look there.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Me.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Is this what you meant, Uncle Jake, when you told me that story about soulmates? And that when I found mine, I would know what forever meant?</i>
		</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Randi settled back against the headboard and placed a whisper-soft kiss on fair hair.
			<i> You were right, Uncle Jake…you were right. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Having decided that she, indeed, wasn't moving from her newly discovered favorite position, the brunette heaved a contented sigh and let her eyes drift shut.</p>
		<p>Only to open them moments later when she heard the subtle clicking of canine toenails on the hardwood floor. She watched as the small, golden canine she had dubbed Gabrielle nimbly leaped up onto the bed and began a cautious but thorough nasal inspection of the sleeping blonde.</p>
		<p>Randi knew that her colleagues in the medical profession would have a fit over what she was allowing to take place, and, under normal circumstances, she might agree.</p>
		<p>But there was nothing normal about these two animals.</p>
		<p>They possessed a wisdom and intelligence that far outstripped most creatures, both the two-legged
			<b>and</b> four-legged kind.
		</p>
		<p>More than that…they cared.</p>
		<p>Which is how the raven-haired woman knew that the subtle growls the little canine emitted during her inspection were born of outrage and the tiny whimpers the golden dog emitted when she finished were pure, unabashed empathy.</p>
		<p>"I know, little bit," the tall woman consoled. "But she'll be all right. We'll make sure of that."</p>
		<p>Mollified, the little animal eased off the bed and joined her midnight-hued partner, who sat beside the bed. Randi watched the two animals as they briefly nuzzled before turning to look at her with a smug "are you happy now" look.</p>
		<p>The proverbial lightbulb flashed above Randi's head, and she turned narrowed eyes on the two.</p>
		<p>"You knew, didn't you?" she accused in a whisper. "That's why you were so restless. You knew she was coming."</p>
		<p>Their answer was as eloquent as it was understated as two sets of eyes, one cinnamon and one electric blue, captured the tall woman's own and held them for a long moment before both animals slid down and stretched out on the cool wood.</p>
		<p>Randi looked down at the resting animals and shook her head.
			<i>God, you two are spooky. </i>
