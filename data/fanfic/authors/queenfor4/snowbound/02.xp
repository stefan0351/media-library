		<p>The doctor briskly dried her hands as she exited the bathroom. "Well, that didn't take long," she commented cheerfully as she moved about the room gathering her things. "The stitches are healing quite nicely, and the bruising pretty quickly. I was pleasantly surprised that you didn't suffer any internal damage or develop an infection." Randi paused and met the green eyes that had been surreptitiously watching her as she moved about the room. "All things considered, Ms Galagher, we were pretty lucky."</p>
		<p>The blonde grimaced and turned her face toward the blinds-covered window. "Forgive me, Dr. Oakes, if my interpretation of 'lucky' differs from yours," she replied hollowly.</p>
		<p>Randi pursed her lips for a thoughtful moment. "Yeah, well, I can see as how it would. But I guess it all boils down to perspective. You look at it as what
			<b>has</b> happened, and how perfectly miserable you are right now. I look at it as what
			<b>could have</b> happened, and how perfectly miserable many people would be, at the loss of such a great storyteller." Randi finished with a crooked grin.
		</p>
		<p>Megan stared at the brunette with narrowed eyes. Every nerve in her body screamed
			<i>She's lying! She's just saying things she thinks you want to hear! </i> But another voice penetrated the cacophony.
			<i>But what if she's not? What if she's really sincere? </i> The writer closed her eyes and sighed. A decision had been made.
			<i>What do I really have to lose right now? </i> But she had just one question.
		</p>
		<p>"Why?"</p>
		<p>The tall woman was confused. "Why? Why what?"</p>
		<p>"Why are you so nice to me?"</p>
		<p>The smile returned with a playful arch of her eyebrow. "Why not?"</p>
		<p>Two words, agonizingly simple, but complex enough to leave the wordsmith floundering for a rejoinder that never came. The tall woman didn't give her time to fret over the verbal inadequacy though, as she began speaking again.</p>
		<p>"You know, it occurred to me that you sit in here, day in, day out, with absolutely nothing to do but stare at the walls. I don't have a TV for this room, and I don't think you'd care for the books I have." This last part said with a guilty grin that earned her a withering glare from the blonde. Ignoring the look, she continued. "I'm still working on a way to get you out of this room for a while. But, until I do," the brunette stopped talking momentarily as she walked over to the big chair and picked up the item she had laid there earlier, "I figured you might occupy yourself with this for a while."</p>
		<p>Megan gasped as the doctor gently placed the laptop computer in her lap. "Oh, God."</p>
		<p>The tall woman made quick work of connecting the modem line to the wall outlet. Then, reaching over, she lifted the lid and tapped the power switch.</p>
		<p>The absolutely joyful smile on the younger woman's face as the darkened screen came to life made Randi's heart do cartwheels.
			<i>Houston, we have liftoff. </i>
		</p>
		<p>"I've got MSN as my service provider," she explained to the blonde, who was already tapping keys, "but I also have access to AOL and Netscape. You can 'surf' to your heart's content, check your email, find some fanfic sites if you want to do some reading, or…" she held up the floppy discs she'd removed from her back pocket, "do some writing. It may be a little awkward with your bad arm, but I don't think that will stop you."</p>
		<p>Seeing that the writer's attention was already riveted to her new toy, the doctor chuckled to herself.
			<i>I guess it's time for me to stop babbling and make my exit. </i> "Well," the doctor began, as she placed the discs on the folding table, "I guess I'd better…" She was stopped cold by a tentative hand placed briefly on hers.
		</p>
		<p>Startled blue eyes collided with green for a fleeting instant, before the green moved down swiftly to the keyboard.</p>
		<p>"I…" Nervous fingers caressed the keyboard, "I…um…thank you. You didn't have to do all this, but I really appreciate it."</p>
		<p>"I know I didn't have to," the tall woman responded, smiling warmly, "but I wanted to. And you're very welcome."</p>
		<p>A comfortable silence settled between the two women as they absorbed the comfort of a moment that, for once, was not clouded by fear, mistrust or defensiveness.</p>
		<p>The furry blonde head appearing in the doorway broke the moment. "It looks like you have a visitor," the tall woman chuckled.</p>
		<p>"Or two," the writer added as a larger, midnight-colored head joined the first. "Hello, ladies," she greeted, as the two canines cautiously entered the room.</p>
		<p>The tall woman squatted down and stroked a golden head with one hand, while reaching her other hand out in anticipation of the large black paw that settled in it; an apparent ritual that the author observed with an expression of bemused curiosity that did not go unnoticed by the doctor.</p>
		<p>"Miss 'Attitude' doesn't seem to like being petted," the doctor offered in explanation. "She'd rather do the handshake thing." The blonde rolled her eyes, and the doctor just shrugged, "Hey, who am I to argue?" The tall woman rose to her full height, "Well, I've got some shoveling to do." Heading to the door, she noticed she had only one shadow. "Are you coming?" she inquired of the smaller canine that sat placidly by the foot of the bed. The lack of movement by the little one gave Randi her answer. "She seems to want to keep you company for a while," she announced to the blonde. "Is that all right with you?"</p>
		<p>The young woman looked down at the hopeful little face. "We'll be fine."</p>
		<p>The doctor nodded. "If you need anything, Ms Galagher, just tell her to come get me. Believe it, or not, she'll understand." As the tall woman turned to exit, she was halted by a single word.</p>
		<p>"Megan."</p>
		<p>"Excuse me?"</p>
		<p>The blonde's eyes stared fixedly at the computer screen, but her voice was soft.</p>
		<p>"My name is Megan."</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Twelve">
		<p>The tall woman whistled merrily as she strolled down the hallway behind her 'special surprise'.</p>
		<p>
			<i>She's gonna love this, </i> the brunette mused happily. The past two weeks had had their ups and downs, with both women trying to bridge the gap that their differences provided. But the enforced isolation they were enduring often left them moody and snappish with each other. When that happened, both women would retreat to their own little worlds; Megan to her writing, and occasional phone calls to her publisher friend, and Randi to her weights room, for a vigorous workout. The brunette also spent her time trying to clear the snow from in front of the house, as well as exploring the house, looking for minor faults to repair. It was on one of these 'expeditions' that Randi discovered her prize. The entire second story of the large ranch house was one huge attic and storage space, and the raven-haired woman was up there checking the insulation. The lightbulb in the huge room had blown out, and Randi was shining her flashlight around the room, looking for something to stand on so she could reach the light fixture. "Son of a bitch," the doctor muttered with a grin, as the flashlight's beam spotlighted the dusty frame of a wheelchair.
			<i> An
				<b>electric</b> wheelchair, at that.
			</i> The tall woman knelt by the chair, and ran the flashlight over it, doing a quick visual examination.
			<i>I forgot this was here. This is just what Megan needs to get out of that damn room for a while. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Randi's Uncle Jake would get severe attacks of gout, and he'd needed the chair to get around. Having it motorized had allowed him more freedom of movement. After he'd passed Randi had stored it in her attic, always intending to donate it to charity and never getting around to it. Now she was glad she hadn't.</p>
		<p>A slight frown creased the woman's full lips.
			<i>Hmm, the control is on the right side, and her right arm is in a splint right now. </i> She scooted closer, examining the wiring. After a few moments, she shrugged,
			<i> no problem; I'll just switch the control to the left arm. </i> All thoughts of the blown light bulb were forgotten, as she exited the attic with her dusty treasure. It took a few days, and a variety of colorful curses, but she was finally wheeling her cleaned, shiny, fully functional prize to Megan's door. Parking it just out of sight of the open doorway, she tapped lightly on the doorframe.
		</p>
		<p>"Come in."</p>
		<p>The blonde was sitting propped up in the big bed. Her breakfast tray was moved to the bedside table, and she sat with her head lying back, eyes closed.</p>
		<p>"Was everything okay?" the brunette inquired.</p>
		<p>"Everything was excellent…as usual," the blonde responded with a wan smile.</p>
		<p>Randi couldn't help but notice the listlessness of the blonde's response.
			<i>Oh yeah, she's been in that bed, and in this room too long. </i>
		</p>
		<p>"Are you okay?" she inquired of the melancholy blonde.</p>
		<p>"I'm fine," she responded with little conviction as she looked over to the window. "Tell me, what's it like out there?" the writer asked wistfully.</p>
		<p>"Well, it's white," the brunette answered coyly, earning her a green-eyed glare. "But it's really pretty. Everything looks so clean and unsullied. And the trees," the brunette paused, staring out the window, searching for the right description, "the trees look like they're wearing coats made of the fluffiest white clouds."</p>
		<p>"Thank you for that image," the blonde responded sincerely. "I wish I could see them, for myself."</p>
		<p>"You can, actually. There's a picture window in the livingroom with a great view."</p>
		<p>"That's all well and good," the blonde answered with pique, somewhat hurt and annoyed at the tall woman's unthinking remark, "but in case you've forgotten, I have a slight mobility problem right now."</p>
		<p>"Maybe," the brunette answered and, to the blonde's surprise, turned and left the room.</p>
		<p>"Or maybe not," she smiled as she re-entered the room with the wheelchair.</p>
		<p>Megan's eyes grew saucer wide as she beheld the gleaming black and chrome mobile chair.</p>
		<p>"Please," the blonde whispered as she lurched forward, pulling at the covers, "please tell me this isn't a joke."</p>
		<p>"It's not a joke," the doctor grinned proudly, before scrambling over to the bed, preparing to catch the smaller woman before she threw herself off it. "Whoa, slow down," she admonished the writer. Finally managing to get the young woman's attention, she laid down a few rules. "You're going to need my help getting in and out of this thing, at least until your arm and leg have healed more," she informed the blonde, who nodded eagerly. "No wheelies. No racing. And no chasing the dogs," she recited solemnly, and getting an equally solemn nod in return. This solemnity lasted all of five seconds before the blonde let out a gleeful yip and threw her good arm around the startled doctor.</p>
		<p>Randi froze when the small woman wrapped her in a grateful hug. Her first instinct was to return the embrace, but fear that the blonde would mis-interpret the act, kept her still. Her caution was well founded. When the blonde, realizing her position, drew back suddenly, as if she had been burned.</p>
		<p>"I…" The writer was flustered and embarrassed, angered at her own impetuous act. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get carried away like that."</p>
		<p>Sensing the younger woman's discomfort, the doctor acted to dispel it. "No problem," the tall woman replied as she stood up, "at least you didn't use your splinted arm. You might have knocked me out," she winked.</p>
		<p>Her teasing reply produced the desired results; as evidenced by a small pink tongue being playfully poked out at her.</p>
		<p>A witty rejoinder of 'promises, promises' briefly flashed through the tall woman's mind, and was quickly discarded. She settled for a brief chuckle as she positioned the chair next to the bed and locked the wheels.</p>
		<p>"Now, until your limbs are strong enough, it's going to be up to me to get you in and out of this chair," the brunette announced. Seeing the expected look of discomfort cross the young woman's face, she knelt in front of her.</p>
		<p>"Look, I know that part of it doesn't appeal to you. But we both want you out of this room, and right now this is the only way that's going to happen." Capturing the green eyes with her own, the doctor inquired gently, "Will you trust me?"</p>
		<p>Years of homophobic reasoning screamed at her to say no, to recognize this as yet another attempt to seduce her and then use her.
			<i>But she has been nothing but good to me. She's given me everything, and asked for nothing. Even now she's trying to give me freedom, and is asking only a small bit of trust. How can I say no? Besides that, I…I
				<b>want</b> to trust her. I like her…God help me…I like her.
			</i> Releasing her anxiety with a nervous exhale, the blonde nodded.
		</p>
		<p>"Great!" the tall woman exclaimed as she quickly rose and removed the right armrest from the chair. Turning back to the bed, she finished removing the covers from the blonde's body, and with a courtly bow exclaimed, "Your chariot awaits, milady."</p>
		<p>With a nervous snort, the blonde cautiously lifted her splinted arm, and placed it behind the tall woman's neck, and uttered a startled squeak as she was effortlessly lifted in strong arms.</p>
		<p>In one smooth motion, the tall woman turned and gently placed her petite patient in the chair. As she set about replacing the armrest and adjusting the footrest, the doctor was mentally chastising herself for the feelings that having the young woman in her arms invoked.
			<i> It felt so good, she felt so wonderful. I wish it had lasted longer. Stop it! Stop it right now! Her conscience bellowed, She is your
				<b>patient!</b> Your helpless, emotionally damaged, barely trusting,
				<b>patient.</b> She doesn't need this garbage…and neither do you.
			</i> The doctor acknowledged the truth of that lecture with an inaudible sigh as she finished her adjustments, completely unaware that the patient in question was having a very similar argument with herself.
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>"And this," the doctor announced with a dramatic flair, "is 'The Picture Window.' From which you can see miles and miles of snow, snowcapped trees, and the occasional beautifully rendered sunrise."</p>
		<p>The writer was speechless, as she gazed out into a world of pure, pristine elegance as far as the eye could see. Massive pine trees stood as silver clad sentinels, keeping watch over the small creatures that darted through the whitened landscape, both searching for food, and just plain romping.</p>
		<p>"Pretty, isn't it?" came the soft, mellow voice beside her.</p>
		<p>"Pretty doesn't even begin to describe it," breathed the author, who reluctantly tore her gaze away from the snowy tableau to study the woman squatting beside her. The writer had to admit that Dr. Randi Oakes was indeed a beautiful woman. Her high cheekbones, aquiline nose, and full pink lips were the stuff of artists dreams, but even they paled in comparison to the winter blue pools that were the woman's eyes. Eyes that, the writer observed over time, served as an excellent barometer of the tall woman's moods; ranging from an icy silver-blue when she was angry, to a soft aquamarine when she was happy; which she seemed to be at this moment. And somewhere, far back in her mind, some part of her wondered what color they were when the woman was in the throes of passion.</p>
		<p>Deciding that the young woman had studied her enough, Randi opted for a trip to the kitchen for some hot chocolate. A course of action wholly supported by a young blonde with a weakness for chocolate.</p>
		<p>The break to the kitchen gave the tall doctor a chance to corral the hyperactive butterflies that were throwing a party in her belly. It wasn't so much that the author was studying her, for she had noticed the young woman doing that a lot in the past few weeks. No, it was the
			<b>intensity</b> of this latest study, as if the young woman were blind, and running mental fingers over every inch of Randi's face. The scrutiny created a riot of sensations that Randi hadn't felt since….well…for a long time. And if she hadn't gotten away, she might have done something that both of them would regret.
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Megan Galagher was clearly unhappy. Once the tall doctor had left the room, it was as if the young woman had snapped out of a trance.
			<i>What in the hell were you doing? </i> The homophobe screamed at her.
			<i>You were ogling her like a starving man ogles a piece of steak. She's supposed to be the pervert here, but you can't seem to keep your damned eyes off her. That's not true, </i>the writer argued.
			<i> I was simply studying her. Whether you want to admit it or not, she is a classically beautiful woman. I was just noting her features…in case I wanted to use her likeness in one of my stories. </i>the writer finished, satisfied with her explanation.
			<i>Keep telling yourself that, </i>the homophobe snorted.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>She is beautiful, is she not? </i> another small voice whispered. A gentle, knowing voice that was sounding more and more like Charly every time.
			<i>Beautiful…and gentle…and kind. Everything she is not supposed to be in your somewhat narrow perception of what 'her kind' is like. It makes you wonder, doesn't it, </i> the kindly voice continued,
			<i>If you're wrong about Dr. Oakes…then perhaps you may be wrong about other things too. </i> With that, thankfully, the voice was quiet. Leaving the young woman to sigh at the headache that these confusing thoughts were causing.
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Randi entered the room just in time to hear the amused giggles of her patient.
			<i>Great God almighty! </i>the tall woman mused with a grin.
			<i>She's laughing. I never thought I'd hear her laugh. </i> Curious, the doctor hurried over to the picture window to see what her patient found so amusing. A grin split her face as she looked out and saw a small golden streak emerge from the trees; closely followed by a larger ebony body that was curiously covered with snow. The smaller creature headed, full bore, toward the house, and suddenly seemed to disappear.
		</p>
		<p>"Good grief, where did she go?" the wide-eyed blonde inquired, as she watched the big black dog skid to a stop just before the stairs. The thwarted canine launched into a round of, what seemed like, canine expletives, then with head held high, sauntered back towards the woods.</p>
		<p>"She went under the porch. She knows Xena can't fit under there," the brunette explained.</p>
		<p>"Xena?"</p>
		<p>"Uh, heh, yeah."</p>
		<p>"Let me guess," the blonde said with a smirk, "the little one is Gabrielle?"</p>
		<p>"Yup," Randi said with a grin.</p>
		<p>"Do I want to know how you came to call them that? Please don't tell me it's because they're both queer." The blonde cringed inwardly at the last part. It was uncalled for, but was out of her mouth before she could stop it.</p>
		<p>If the doctor took offense, she didn't show it. "Not at all," she answered. "There were quite a few reasons. Like the TV characters, one is light and one is dark. Also like the TV characters, the small one is gentle, outgoing, empathic and loving, while the large one is stoic, aloof, and a bad ass. But very fierce and protective of those she cares for; especially the little one. I think the main reason the names fit is, again, like the TV characters, these two are the best of friends, and so totally devoted to each other that it isn't funny."</p>
		<p>"Interesting," the blonde commented, "When you put it like that, I guess the names do fit. So, have you had them since they were puppies, or did you adopt them?"</p>
		<p>The tall woman chuckled. "No, I haven't had them that long. And, if the truth were known, it's more like they adopted me." At the writer's quizzically raised eyebrow, the brunette settled on the floor and launched into the tale of her first encounter with the canine companions.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Thirteen">
		<p>Megan lay in her bed, wide-awake and slightly frustrated. It was one o'clock in the morning and, by all rights, she should be sleeping soundly. But sleep was eluding her, and she couldn't figure out why. She looked down at the two furry bodies that lay sprawled on her floor in blissful slumber, and grinned in remembrance of their earlier antics.
			<i>Maybe I'm just still too wired, </i> she reasoned. It had been a full day for the writer. The good doctor was an attentive hostess as she gave the small blonde a full tour of the massive ranch house; relating little anecdotes of her growing years with her beloved uncle. The tall woman enlisted her help in preparing dinner as well.
			<i>I've never been an 'official taste-tester' before</i> the blonde mused with a smile.
		</p>
		<p>She finished off the day by having a long enjoyable chat with her publisher and friend. Charly was pleased that Megan was warming to the doctor. The publisher harbored a secret hope that the writer and the doctor would establish a friendship that would last beyond their current situation. Megan was disappointed to learn that her live-in love was carrying on with his partying lifestyle as if she didn't exist.
			<i>With my money, of course. </i> Her lover didn't even bat an eyelash when he was informed of her situation. He was provided with Randi's number in case he wanted to call the injured writer, but that call never came. And, sadly, Megan acknowledged to herself that she would have to see the writing on the wall, and make some changes when she got back to her life. In spite of that situation, her verbal visit with her friend was a pleasant end to an unexpectedly pleasant day. "So, why aren't I sleeping?" she grumbled to no one in particular.
		</p>
		<p>Her frustrated reverie was interrupted by a long, pained
			<i>
				<b>'nooooo'</b>
			</i> that echoed down the hall. Her heart began to pound, as she looked down at the canines that suddenly snapped awake; their heads cocked to the side as they listened alertly. The pained voice came again.
			<i>
				<b>"Stay with me, Casey, don't leave me, baby."</b>
			</i> The writer watched as the two canines looked at each other for a moment, before the little one rose and trotted out the door and down the hall. The writer watched the small dog's departure with a mixture of confusion and concern. She knew it was Randi's voice she was hearing, but the pain in that voice had her worried. As if reading her thoughts, the ebony canine approached the bed, sat down, and placed a large, black paw on the edge of the bed. The writer eyed the beautiful, dark animal that stared at her with intense blue eyes.
		</p>
		<p>"Ya know," the writer mumbled uncertainly, "I feel kinda silly talking to a dog, but, is she…I mean Randi…okay?"</p>
		<p>A gentle, rumbling 'uurrrr' was the response, which made the young woman giggle in surprise and relief.</p>
		<p>
			<i>
				<b>The small body arched stiffly for a long moment before sinking bonelessly back on the bed. Worried blue eyes looked to the nearby monitor, hoping for some variation in the lonely green line that split the screen; Nothing. "Again," she barked. She gazed down at the small, still body in the bed. "C'mon Casey, don't leave me. We've got a circus to go to, you can't leave." Picking up the defibrillator paddles, she announced "Clear" and positioned them on the small chest. A loud thump echoed through the room as the little body arched and slumped again. And still the monitor maintained it's slender green thread. The dark-skinned physician that was first on the scene looked with sorrow filled eyes to the redhead at the back of the room. "I'm sorry. There's nothing more to be done." With that, he motioned for the other two nurses to join him as they silently left the room. With tears cascading down pale cheeks, she approached the bed where the tall doctor was bent over the still form, still whispering pleas for the child to come back. "Randi" a trembling hand touched a white-coated shoulder. "She's gone. Let her go." The shoulder flinched, and watery blue eyes looked up into tear-filled amber orbs. Any professional composure the brunette had, left her, as her face crumpled and she dropped to her knees, whispering 'I'm sorry, I should have been here' over and over again. </b>
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>The small golden canine sat at the foot of the bed watching her two-legged companion thrash and moan in the twisted, sweat-dampened sheets, and it made her quite unhappy. She liked this tall human. She was friendlier, kinder, and even smelled better than other two-legged ones she had come across in her travels. Even her big, dark companion liked her; and considering that the dark one didn't like a whole lot of things, that was saying quite a bit. Therefore, when the two-legged one was in distress, it was up to her and her companion to make it better.</p>
		<p>With a smooth leap, the little animal was on the bed at the foot. Randi lay curled in a tight fetal position, with handfuls of sheet clutched tightly to her chest. The small canine belly-crawled up the bed until she was nose-to-nose with the moaning woman; and with a gentleness reminiscent of her fictional namesake, began to place little licks upon the forehead and cheeks of the somnolent woman.</p>
		<p>Heavy eyelids opened, and groggy blue eyes met gentle cinnamon orbs. "Come to my rescue again eh, little one?" the tall woman sleepily burred. Her only answer was a little whimper and a light lick of her sweaty forehead. Pushing down the lump in her throat, the tall woman gathered the little canine to her chest. "Thank you. I love you too." She rumbled to the small creature who snuggled into her with a contented canine sigh.</p>
		<p>"Hello?" The voice drifted faintly down the hall, causing woman and animal to start in surprise.</p>
		<p>"She's awake?" It was a statement more than a question, so Randi didn't look for a response as she released the little animal and began to rise from the bed. "I guess we better go see if everything's okay."</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>The writer lay in the bed, silently cursing her inability to get out of it.
			<i>I hope everything's okay. </i>She had called a 'hello' down the hall, but hadn't received a response.
			<i>But I'm sure if it wasn't, ol' dark-and-dangerous here would have checked it out by now. </i> The canine to which she was referring sat placidly next to the bed, her head resting next to the writer's hand, allowing the blonde to idly scratch and stroke the sensitive area behind the large pointed ears. This was doggie heaven, and the big Shepherd had no intention of moving; even though she heard the quiet approach of her companions.
		</p>
		<p>"I always knew you were a closet pleasure hound," the tall woman rumbled from the open doorway. Earning her a startled gasp from the blonde, and a sidelong 'so what' glance from the dark canine that hadn't bothered to budge from her cozy position.</p>
		<p>"Randi," the relieved blonde exclaimed, "are you….I mean, is everything okay? I heard….I was…" the blonde trailed off, uncomfortable with displaying how concerned she really was.</p>
		<p>"I'm fine," the brunette reassured as she crossed the room. Stopping next to the bed, she squatted down, meeting the shyly concerned green eyes of the blonde. "It was just a nightmare. I have them every now and then."</p>
		<p>"Can you remember them? Do you want to talk about it," the writer inquired helpfully, and was startled by the intense look of pain that flashed across those expressive blue eyes.</p>
		<p>"Um, no…I can't." she whispered, trying desperately to regain the composure that the young woman had nearly shattered by asking that simple but caring question. "Perhaps someday," she continued, "but not just yet. Thanks for asking though, and thanks for being concerned." Taking a chance, she reached over and gently grasped the younger woman's hand. Catching the green eyes that widened slightly, she added, "that means a lot."</p>
		<p>And was surprised when small fingers closed over her hand in a gentle squeeze.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Fourteen">
		<p>Megan was bored. She had spent most of the day reading, corresponding with friends, and writing while Randi busied herself with minor chores. Now she was restless, eyesore, and her behind was a little sore from sitting all day. She was in dire need of some pampering,
			<i>Some hot chocolate and cookies would do nicely right now, </i> or at least someone to talk to.
			<i>A certain tall, dark-haired doctor would do quite well too</i>, her little 'Charly' voice helpfully supplied.
			<i>Knock it off, </i> the voice of reason admonished, as she began her search for the woman in question.
			<i>It's not like there are a whole bunch of other people here to talk to. This is true, </i> little Charly agreed,
			<i>but you have to admit, the delightful Dr. Oakes is quickly moving up on that short list of people whose company you truly enjoy. Quite an accomplishment for one of
				<b>those</b> people, wouldn't you say?
			</i> "Oh, shut up," the blonde muttered aloud, effectively ending the debate.
		</p>
		<p>As much as she didn't want to, Megan had to admit, she
			<b>did</b> enjoy the tall woman's company. It had been a week since that night she had heard Randi cry out in her sleep. A week in which, against all odds, the two women had grown closer. A week of talking, laughing, mid-night snacks, and horror stories of their youth. Their conversations covered a world of topics and often sparked friendly debates that would keep them going until the wee hours of the morning. The only subjects the two women tended to steer clear of, were Megan's mother, and Randi's nightmares.
			<i>Perhaps someday</i>, the blonde mused, as she motored down the hallway in search of her hostess. She cracked a wry grin at the memory of one such 'debate.'
		</p>
		<p>"Oh baloney! They are too!" the blonde proclaimed obstinately, as she kept trying, and failing, to cross her arms at her chest.</p>
		<p>"Hmmm, I'm not so sure about that," the brunette returned, smiling benignly. She was playing 'devil's advocate,' and loving every minute.</p>
		<p>"Oh, don't give me that! You're one of
			<b>them</b>, and if you can't see it, then you're as blind as a bat."
		</p>
		<p>"See what? I've never seen them in a serious lip lock. I've never seen them roll around under the covers. And I'm certain I've never seen the Amazons presenting either one of them with a toaster." The tall woman couldn't help but grin at the green-eyed glare she was receiving.</p>
		<p>"Well of course you're not going to see that, the producers aren't stupid," the writer huffed, fully aware she was being baited, but enjoying herself anyway. "But you can still tell. I mean, look at how touchy-feely they are with each other. That's …Ooowww" the blonde suddenly stiffened her foot, "cramp," she groaned.</p>
		<p>The brunette rose from her chair and crossed the room. Kneeling next to the bed, she uncovered and gently lifted the affected foot and began to massage it. "Are you talking about the consoling hugs, or the gentle touches?" Receiving no response, the doctor looked up into green eyes that were half closed in hedonistic pleasure from the gentle massage. "Or are you referring to how they tend to each other's hurts…" suppressing a grin as she felt the cramped muscle relax. "Offer comfort to each other when it's needed." She placed the foot back on the bed and pulled the cover back over it. Moving up to the head, she removed the extra pillow from behind the blonde, allowing her to lie prone in the bed. The writer remained quiet; listening and gazing fixedly through half-closed eyes as the tall woman tucked the covers around her. "Is that what you're talking about?" Randi leaned over and tenderly brushed away an errant lock of blond hair. "It doesn't necessarily mean they're lovers…" As the writer surrendered to slumber's call, twinkling blue eyes and whispered words followed her into Morpheus' realm.</p>
		<p>"…It just means they're friends."</p>
		<p>As the blonde neared her destination, she couldn't help but marvel at the smooth, subtle ease with which the doctor proved her point.
			<i>She was caring for me the same way they care for each other, and
				<b>we're</b> not lovers. Very smooth, doctor.
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Aha, found ya, </i> the writer gloated when she heard the telltale 'clank' of barbells.
			<i>Time to…Oh, my! </i> The blonde's thought processes were put on immediate hold as she gazed in fascination at the sweating, straining figure lying on the slender metal bench. The tall doctor was doing reps with a set of barbells that, judging from the size of the metal discs on each side, had to weigh a great deal.
			<i>God, she's lifting that thing like it was made of paper! </i> Indeed, the only telltale signs of the effort Randi was putting into her chore were the even, labored breaths she was taking, and the rhythmic bunching and flexing of marvelously pronounced muscles.
			<i>Good grief, no wonder she can lift me like I weighed nothing. This woman is
				<b>built!</b> And speaking of built,
			</i>little Charly mischievously piped up as the writers eyes, quite unconsciously, began a thorough perusal of the body on the bench. From the long, tapered fingers that gripped the barbell, to the sneaker covered feet that were planted firmly on the floor, fascinated eyes covered every inch.
			<i>My word, she is a goddess! </i> On their return trip from the doctor's feet, the green eyes seemed intent on focusing on the full breasts, hard abdomen, and lean thighs that were painfully highlighted by the sweat-soaked clothing that clung to them. And try as she might to peruse other areas, the writer's gaze stubbornly kept returning to those rock hard thighs and, much to her consternation, the forbidden area in between. Unconsciously, she licked her lips, and was startled by the fluttering in her lower belly.
			<i>Oh, this isn't good…this isn't good at all. I think I need some cold water…to drink. Yup, a good, cold glass of water. </i> With her mind set on beating a hasty retreat, the blonde reached for the control switch and began to turn the chair around.
		</p>
		<p>"Hello there."</p>
		<p>
			<i>Oh, crap! </i>
		</p>
		<p>The writer turned the chair back around, plastering an innocent smile on her face and silently praying that her cheeks were not as red as they felt. "Um, hi there."</p>
		<p>"Is everything okay?" the brunette inquired, as she toweled the sweat from her face.</p>
		<p>"Uh, everything's fine," the writer semi-squeaked. If she thought her body's reactions were bad before, when Randi was on the bench, they were worse now. The tall woman stood less than five feet away from her. Close enough for the writer to see the droplets of sweat that traveled down the woman's chest, to disappear into her cleavage. Close enough to notice the small, pert nipples that were not quite erect, but not quite relaxed either. Close enough to smell the sweat, and the fragrance of hyacinth the she had come to associate with the tall doctor. And close enough for the little homophobic voice to be having a total meltdown.</p>
		<p>"Are you sure?" the doctor inquired, mildly concerned. "You're looking a little pink." She wanted to feel the smaller woman's forehead, to check for fever, but the slightly wild look in the writer's eyes told her it would not be a good idea right now.</p>
		<p>"Oh, yeah, I'm fine," the writer waved off the concern. "It's just a little warm in here."</p>
		<p>Not believing her for a moment, but deciding not to press the issue, the brunette shrugged. "Yeah, it tends to get a little humid in here when I'm exercising."</p>
		<p>Not getting a response from the smaller woman, and needing to dispel the odd tension in the air, the tall woman spoke again. "Hey, why don't we make our way to the living room and I'll pour you a nice, cold glass of iced tea. And while you're sipping on that, I'll jump in the shower and hose myself off, then come back and make us a couple of sandwiches?"</p>
		<p>
			<i>Bless you, doctor! </i> "That sounds like a winner," the younger woman agreed with a silent sigh of relief.
		</p>
		<p> Megan sat in front of the picture window idly sipping her iced tea. At first glance, one would assume that she was enjoying the picturesque view. Truth to tell, she wasn't even seeing it. She was too wrapped up in the battle that was going on inside her head.
			<i>What the fuck are you doing? </i> the homophobe was screaming.
			<i>First you stop treating her like the dirtbag she is, then you start talking to her…being nice to her…talking to her like you two are old friends. And now you're drooling over her while she's lifting weights. You're becoming a pervert…just like them, </i> the voice finished in a hiss.
			<i>No I'm not! </i> she retorted vehemently.
			<i> I was not 'drooling', I was just impressed by her physique, </i> the writer defended, earning a derisive snort from the homophobe.
			<i>And as for being nice to her, why the hell not? She's been good to me when she had absolutely no reason to be. She's helping me realize that the world isn't as black and white as you want me to think. That not every gay woman is evil. That some of them are wonderfully kind…and giving…and caring, </i> the writer trailed off as the burn of burgeoning tears stung her eyes.
			<i>Kind of like someone you used to know, eh, little one? </i> little Charly gently whispered.
			<i>No! Don't you even go there! </i> the writer snarled.
			<i>If she really cared she would have written to me, she would have called, she wouldn't have left me so alone. </i>
		</p>
		<p>"So alone," the writer croaked aloud as she buried her face in her hands and gave way to the tears that had been building for years.</p>
		<p>In a far corner of the room, two pair of eyes watched the young woman dissolve into tears. Both of them were distressed by the scene, but neither moved. No, this one was not for them to comfort. This was a job for the other; and she would be here soon.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Randi stood with her hands braced against the shower wall. Her head hung limply between outstretched arms, and she groaned in near-orgasmic bliss as the pounding spray of the twin showerheads assaulted her body from shoulders to calves. The hot, pulsing water massaged and relaxed tight, well-worked muscles, pushing the tall woman into a state of near boneless lassitude while her mind replayed the events in the weights room. She had been aware of the small woman's presence in the doorway, but, as the woman hadn't tried to get her attention in any way, she saw no need to interrupt her workout, figuring that everything was fine, and the young woman was just watching her out of idle curiosity. However, the sight of the writer as she approached her caused the doctor to re-think her earlier assessment. The younger woman's face was flushed, her eyes wide and slightly glassy. Her pupils, what little there was of them, had taken on a darker shade, and her breathing was slightly elevated. The doctor was immediately concerned but, not wanting to argue with her patient, accepted her word that it was just the heat.
			<i>I don't buy that for a minute. Room temperature doesn't make your eyes go all glassy and dark. And it certainly doesn't elevate your breathing…unless the heat is a little more extreme. No, she was showing all the signs of being totally embarrassed, or flustered, or… </i>Randi's head shot up and her eyes grew saucer wide as the final thought hit her.
			<i>Or aroused!!?? Oh no, no way…huh uh…no possible way, </i>Randi's mind shouted furiously, as she turned and grabbed the soap.
			<i>This is not happening. This is your overactive imagination, Oakes. Yes, she's beautiful. Yes, she's bright, and witty, and warm,
				<b>but</b>… she is not that way…she never will be that way…she doesn't like that way. And even if she's having doubts and wants to try that way, you will
				<b>not</b> be her guinea pig! So derail that train of thought and drop the whole issue. Accept her explanation and leave it at that.
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>Randi sighed as she stepped out of the shower and grabbed her towel. Part of her was glad that her conscience knocked some sense into her head. But another part of her ached at things that could never be.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Fifteen">
		<p>Randi padded into the kitchen humming to herself and feeling invigorated after her shower. Pulling the bread from the cabinet, she paused.
			<i>I should bring her in here and find out what kind of sandwich she'd like. </i> Having made that decision she put down the bread and exited the kitchen; stopping dead in her tracks when she heard muffled sobbing.
			<i>Megan?? Shit! </i> With her heart in her throat she scrambled into the livingroom and dropped to her knees beside the sobbing woman. "Megan, what's wrong? Are you sick? Is something hurting? The doctor fired off the questions while doing a rapid visual inspection. The only response she received to her questions was a quick headshake as the woman continued to cry.
		</p>
		<p>With a low growl, the doctor allowed her heart to overrule her caution as she removed the armrest from the chair and slid her arms underneath and behind the small woman and, being careful of the injured limbs, lifted her out of the chair. In one smooth motion, she sat back on her behind and lowered the smaller woman onto her lap. Wrapping long arms around the quivering frame, she murmured soft reassurances.</p>
		<p>Quickly overcoming her surprise at the doctor's actions, the heartsick woman accepted the comfort that was being offered and burrowed deeply into the warm softness. Whatever emotional walls she had left came tumbling down as a bitter, confused and lonely young woman convulsed in sobs; repeating two words over and over again, like a mantra. "So alone. So alone. So alone."</p>
		<p>Randi felt her own heart breaking as she held the quivering body tightly. "It's okay," she crooned, "you're not alone. I'm here. I've got you."</p>
		<p>
			<i>I'm here, Megan. And I'll be here for you as long as you need me. </i>
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>The dwindling remains of daylight cast silvered shadows throughout the room, and gently highlighted the huddled figures on the floor. The smaller woman lay limply against the larger body; having cried herself into a state of near exhaustion. The larger woman sat placidly with her head lolling back on the cushions of the couch she was leaning against. Her arms, though loose in their grip, still surrounded the young woman; continuing to offer what comfort they could.</p>
		<p>Finally marshaling her strength, the writer lifted her head and drew back some from her warm haven; looking up into liquid blue eyes that radiated so much caring and concern that it almost made her break into tears again.</p>
		<p>"I'm, uh…I'm sorry," the blonde rasped, "I don't…I couldn't …"</p>
		<p>"Don't," Randi gently interrupted her. "You have nothing to apologize for. You've been through a great deal these past five weeks. You've had to deal with the pain of your injuries, the fear and uncertainty of being trapped and helpless in an unfamiliar environment. You've been forced to co-exist with, and submit to, an individual who represents everything you detest." Alert green eyes caught the flash of hurt accompanying that statement before Randi concealed it and continued. "And to top it all off, you've had to go through all this alone; without family or even a friend who could hold your hand and tell you it's gonna be okay. Considering all that," Randi tenderly brushed a lock of hair away from watery green eyes and smiled, "a good, heavy crying jag is nothing. You're a good, brave, strong woman, Megan Galagher, and, circumstances aside, I'm glad I got to know you."</p>
		<p>
			<i>Oh, god. </i> The blonde buried her face in the warm hollow of the doctor's collarbone; no longer able to face that sweet smile and warm, caring eyes. "Thank you," she mumbled from her hiding place. Then gathering her courage and raising her head, she reconnected with those blue orbs. "Thank you, Randi, for so…many things. Thank you for rescuing me. Thank you for healing me. Thank you for giving me your best when all I gave you was grief." There was a long, thoughtful pause, then she added, "Thank you for being better than me."
		</p>
		<p>Randi's attempt to dispute the last statement was cut short by three fingers that gently covered her lips. A golden head cocked slightly and full lips offered just a hint of a smile.
			<i>You know I'm right, Randi. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Finally, blue eyes blinked in acknowledgment and a single, grateful tear slid down a beautifully sculpted cheek.</p>
		<p>Megan smiled and, with some regret, removed her fingers from the wonderfully soft lips. Feeling that both of them needed to regroup from the intensity of the last hour, the blonde took a deep breath and grinned sheepishly.</p>
		<p>"I don't know about you, but I'm famished."</p>
		<p>Randi smiled, knowing this was a thinly disguised attempt to allow both of them some 'breathing room'. "Come to think of it, I am too." Taking their current positions into account, the tall woman gave a few moments' thought, and came up with a plan. "Okay, I need to get up and, in order to do that, I'm gonna have to set you on the floor for a moment. Is that okay?"</p>
		<p>"What?" the blonde feigned indignation. You mean you can't just flex those well exercised muscles of yours and simply sweep us both up off this floor?"</p>
		<p>The brunette grinned wryly at the jibe. "Well, normally I could. But as I've been sitting here for the past hour with a certain blonde in my lap, my legs have fallen asleep. And I'm gonna have to move that certain blonde to get some circulation back."</p>
		<p>"Suuurre, blame it on the blonde," the writer returned with a roll of her eyes, then squeaked out a yelp as she was effortlessly lifted in strong arms and shifted to the left before being gently deposited on the carpet. Green eyes watched with barely concealed admiration as the raven-haired woman rose with fluid grace. She gave herself a small moment to regain the feeling in her legs, then reached down and gathered the smaller woman into her arms.</p>
		<p>"Okay, chair or couch; where would you like me to dump…er…place you?" the doctor grinned rakishly at the narrow-eyed glare her intentional gaff produced.</p>
		<p>"The couch, if you please," the writer huffed with playful indignity. "My butt's a little sore from sitting in the chair for so long."</p>
		<p>
			<i>I will not go there…I will not go there…I will not go there. </i> "Your wish is my command," the brunette intoned as she deposited her petite patient on the couch, immediately missing the contact.
		</p>
		<p>Placing the ottoman closer to the couch, the doctor gently lifted the younger woman's legs and set them on it.</p>
		<p>"How about we do 'light' tonight? I'll put together some sandwiches and heat up some of that French onion soup you like so much."</p>
		<p>A blinding smile and eager nodding gave her all the answer she needed. "Great! I'll be back in a little bit." With that, she turned and left the room.</p>
		<p>Never aware of green eyes that studiously observed her backside as it exited the room.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Sixteen">
		<p>Randi sighed, for perhaps the twentieth time, as she placed the bowl of soup in the microwave and turned it on. She never knew she could feel so good and so bad at the same time. She was happy, no; elated with the unexpected friendship that had developed between her and the once bitter and spiteful young writer. For beneath the veneer of anger and mistrust, there was a bright, witty, gentle, and utterly charming young woman that one could easily fall in love with.</p>
		<p>And that was the problem.</p>
		<p>Against all odds. Against all good reason. Against every shred of common sense she'd ever possessed, Randi had, indeed, fallen in love with her. And that was the bad part; she knew, without a doubt, that love would never be returned.
			<i>Hell, she'd do her level best to kill me if she knew. </i> Tears burned her eyes as she chuckled at the bitter irony.
			<i>Leave it to me to fall in love with a woman who is not only straight, but is homophobic too. I guess it's no less than I deserve, is it, Casey." </i>
		</p>
		<p>The chiming of the microwave interrupted her morose musings. As she set about transferring the soup to smaller bowls, she concentrated on a fact that was as much a source of pain as relief.
			<i>According to Toby, the main roads are mostly clear, and they'll be able to concentrate on getting my road cleared within the next week or so. Then Ms. Megan can get back to her happy life, and I can get back to … </i>
		</p>
		<p>The intense aching in her heart didn't allow her to finish that thought, as she picked up the dinner tray and walked out of the kitchen.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>"Heads up everyone! Meals on heels is headed your way," the doctor cheerfully proclaimed as she entered the room; bringing a bright smile to the young face that, only a moment ago, was wreathed in sober thought.</p>
		<p>"God, that smells delightful," the writer exclaimed, as the smells from the steaming bowl of soup assailed her nostrils and made her mouth water.</p>
		<p>"Merci," the doctor replied in an exaggerated French accent as she carefully placed the tray in the amused blonde's lap; then sketched a humble bow as she proclaimed, "Nozzing but ze best for Madame."</p>
		<p>"Ooohh, tall, dark, beautiful,
			<b>and</b> charming. Be still, my galloping heart," the blonde retorted, as she batted her eyelashes and mock-fanned her face in a coquettish manner.
			<i>Did I say beautiful? </i>
		</p>
		<p>"And humble. Don't forget that!" the brunette shot back, as she padded back to the kitchen for her tray.
			<i>Did she say beautiful? </i>
		</p>
		<p>Ricky Van Shelton crooned in the background as the two women ate in amiable silence. Finally, having reached a decision, Megan cleared her throat.</p>
		<p>"She left a few weeks after my fifteenth birthday."</p>
		<p>Randi's eyes snapped to the blonde's face, but she kept silent; knowing the young woman was gathering her courage to continue.</p>
		<p>"I remember coming home from school in a really great mood." She smiled at the memory. "I got great marks on a really nasty exam that I had been sweating over, and my English teacher, who I thought hated my guts, took a moment to tell me that I was one of her best students, and she believed I had potential in the literary world. I was one happy camper. When I got home, I just about vibrated into the house. I remember running through the house hollering for mom so I could tell her all about it. When I got to the kitchen I saw my dad sitting at the table, which was unusual 'cause he wasn't due home for a couple more hours. Anyway, he was sitting at the table holding a piece of paper, and he said, in this really dead tone of voice, that mom wasn't home. I asked him when she was gonna be home and he didn't answer me. He just handed me the piece of paper." Megan paused, taking deep breaths in an effort to maintain control. Having accomplished this, she continued. "To this day, I remember every word in that short and not-so-sweet little note. It said: 'Dear Peter. I wish I had the courage to tell you this in person but, unfortunately, I don't. Forgive me, Peter, but I can't live with you anymore. Caitlin has been pleading with me for a very long time to move in with her. I have finally agreed. For with her, I will have something that you have been unable to give me for years; and that, dear Peter, is love. I have talked to Edwin, and he has agreed to handle the divorce proceedings. I, of course, will accept all blame and will not seek any material or financial compensation. It is the least I can do. I'm sorry, Peter.' And that was that," the writer sighed heavily, "she never mentioned me at all. No 'see ya, kid' or 'we'll be in touch, Meg.' Just very brief and concise, no embellishments, no apologies…hell, she didn't even sign her name."</p>
		<p>"That must have been terrible for you and your dad," the brunette murmured, wanting to reach out and comfort her friend, but not sure if it would be welcome at this point.</p>
		<p>"It was seven kinds of hell for me," she admitted. "But, to be honest, I have no idea how it was for my dad." At Randi's puzzled look, the writer explained. "My dad's never been much for showing feelings. He always believed that being emotional or outwardly affectionate was for women and fags." Megan winced inwardly at the word she didn't much care to use anymore. "My mother's desertion only served to make him even more remote. He clothed me and fed me, and made sure I did well in school, and that's as far as it went. If I was lonely, or hurting, well…let's just say I learned to keep it to myself." Megan turned pained eyes to her listener, "Don't get me wrong, Randi. He wasn't cruel, he just…wasn't."</p>
		<p>"Your mother never tried to call or visit…at all?" Randi inquired as she removed the trays to a nearby table and curled herself onto the couch, closer to the younger woman. She had a hard time believing that Megan's mother would abandon her daughter just like that. Her husband, maybe…but not her child.
			<i>And not even a word to her in the note? That's way too odd. </i>
		</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>"Oh, she tried to visit, all right," the writer sneered. "Seven years later. She had the nerve to come to my father's funeral. Telling me how sorry she was that he had died and asking to talk to me."</p>
		<p>"What did you do?"</p>
		<p>Megan had a far away look in her eye. "I told her she had nothing to say that I wanted to hear. If she wanted to talk to me, she should have done so years ago, instead of running off and pretending I didn't exist. She tried telling me she didn't do that, that she loved me, and I guess everything just crashed on me at one time, 'cause I…" Megan faltered, as vivid memories and emotions threatened to overwhelm her. "I hit her," she gasped out. "I slapped her across the face and started screaming at her, telling her not to dare say she loved me, because you don't leave someone you love. You don't hurt her. You don't leave her to wonder what she did wrong to make you leave like that and never see her again. I guess dad's police friends had had enough, 'cause they came and told her to leave. Then they led me back to the car. I remember looking back one last time, and seeing her standing there, with all these tears running down her face, and I thought to myself, now you know how I feel. I never saw her again." The young woman studied her hands as they idly plucked at a loose thread in the blanket that covered her legs. "Pretty pathetic, wasn't I?" she whispered.</p>
		<p>"No," the brunette responded, as she placed a large hand over the two smaller ones. "I'd say pretty hurt. You were dealing with a lot of pain at the time. It's quite normal to lash out at someone you feel was responsible for a great deal of that pain."</p>
		<p>Megan stiffened. "I didn't just
			<b>feel</b> that she was responsible…she
			<b>was</b> responsible. Her and her 'lover.' The last word was spat like a curse.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Okay, she's feeling way too prickly to open a discussion on that subject. Let's go somewhere else. </i> "Who is this Caitlin? Was she a friend of the family?"
		</p>
		<p>Megan relaxed slightly, but retained a scowl. "No. She was my mother's friend. When I was thirteen, mom joined a Tai chi class where Caitlin was one of the instructors. She started out only going there twice a week. But with me spending more time with my friends, and dad spending most of his time at the office anyway, she increased it to five nights a week. After a while, they started spending time together outside of class. Dad didn't seem to pay it much attention He was a CPA, and he spent a lot of time either at the office or hanging out with his cop buddies, who were also his best clients. I didn't pay it much attention either, because Caitlin seemed like a cool person, and I had my friends, so why shouldn't she have hers." Megan closed her eyes as a lonely tear wandered down a pale cheek. "I didn't know friends were supposed to tear families apart," she whispered brokenly.</p>
		<p>Megan looked so small and so very lost. And Randi, for the first time, got a glimpse at the sad and lonely young girl that lived inside the bitter and spite-filled woman.</p>
		<p>And it broke her heart.</p>
		<p>Once again, she allowed her heart to overrule her head, as she spread open her arms; silently offering that young girl the comfort she was denied those long years ago.</p>
		<p>And with a sniffle and a sigh, she accepted.</p>
		<p>"They're not supposed to," the brunette whispered to the golden head tucked beneath her chin. "And they usually don't. But sometimes it happens. Even when they don't mean it to."</p>
		<p>And the evening wore on, much as the afternoon had, with a small body finding a haven in warm, comforting arms. Randi grieved for the pain that her patient had endured, but something in the back of her mind kept telling her that there was more to the story than even Megan knew. But the tall woman doubted she would ever be in a position to find out for sure.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>"Are you sure you're ready for this?" the tall doctor questioned with a grin that earned her a green-eyed glare. "'Cause if you're not, I can leave it on for a while longer."</p>
		<p>"If you don't remove this damn thing right now, I'm going to rip it off myself," the blonde mock-growled. "And then I'm going to stuff it someplace that's gonna make you, and a proctologist, very unhappy."</p>
		<p>"God, some women are just so grouchy," the doctor playfully complained as she set about removing the splint from the blonde's slender leg. After six and a half long weeks, Megan was more than ready to have the restrictive casing removed from her leg. She'd had the arm splint removed a couple of days ago, but the doctor wanted to leave the leg splint on a little longer, preferring to have the young woman do some walking exercises with the aid of a crutch first. That would allow the limb to regain some strength before removing the stiff support.</p>
		<p>Megan sighed in blissful relief as the leg was finally released from its restrictive prison. The doctor graced her with an understanding smile as skilled hands began a probing massage of the freed limb; an action that allowed her to feel for any abnormalities while stimulating the muscles.</p>
		<p>
			<i>God, she looks so tired, </i> the writer mused, with no small worry. The past week had been bad; with the tall woman's nightmares visiting every other night. Megan would lie in bed, listening to the heartbreaking pleas, as Randi begged the mysterious Casey not to leave her. Wishing, time after time, that she could go to her, and cursing, time after time, the damaged limbs that prevented her from doing so. Megan had tried, a couple of times, to get the recalcitrant doctor to talk about her nightmares; even asking outright who Casey was. But the doctor politely refused to discuss the contents of her nightmares, and would only say that Casey was a friend. It was a vague answer that left the young writer frustrated in her friend's unwillingness to confide in her and agonizingly curious about the oft mentioned Casey. Her fertile writer's imagination tended to speculate that Casey had been a sweetheart that the doctor had loved and lost.
		</p>
		<p>Megan studied the face of the woman who was intently focused on the leg she was tending. The strong, high cheekbones that only last week were a healthy tan were now drawn and slightly pale. The full, red lips that always seemed to be on the verge of a smile were now drawn and barely pink. And the eyes that once contained all the warmth and beauty of a summer sky were now pale and gray.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Dammit, Randi, I wish you'd let me in. Let me try to help you, as you've helped me. I care about you, Randi, more than you know. More than I ever thought I could. It hurts to see you suffer like this and not be able to do a damn thing about it. </i>
		</p>
		<p>As if sensing the blonde's thoughtful scrutiny, the brunette looked up and offered a tender, sweet smile that, much to the writer's chagrin, turned her insides to something resembling warm oatmeal.</p>
		<p>"Feel like taking this leg out for a little test run?" the doctor inquired.</p>
		<p>"Run?" the blonde squeaked.</p>
		<p>"Okay, okay. Maybe a slow stroll." The brunette paused for a moment, quietly formulating a plan, then grinned. "How about a stroll out to the porch? It's fully enclosed and runs the entire front half of the house. You can check out the view from the front and sides. There's a large and comfy bench swing out there, where you can give your leg a rest while I scare up some hot tea for the both of us. We can sit for a while and watch the dynamic doggy duo fend off marauding warrior squirrels in between taking potshots at each other."</p>
		<p>The doctor's idea was positively scintillating.
			<i>God, I haven't been outside for so long… </i> "That sounds wonderful," the writer enthused. Then, making the mistake of once again meeting those bluer than blue eyes, she added, "I, uh, I don't want to use the crutch if I don't have to. Will you, um…will you stay beside me? In case I stumble…or something," the writer finished lamely, silently cursing herself for feeling and acting like a shy, teenage schoolgirl.
		</p>
		<p>Randi stood to her full height and held her hand out to the seated blonde. Pulling her gently to her feet, the doctor looked deeply into springtime green eyes. "I'll stay by you forev…for as long as you want me to," the doctor announced solemnly as she placed the writer's smaller hand on her arm and led her out of the room.</p>

		<p>Megan lay in bed, listening to the tinny ringing of the telephone, and feeling her annoyance level steadily rising.
			<i>No answer. Big surprise there, the writer mentally snorted. He doesn't answer the phone, doesn't check the messages, doesn't return my calls. What the fuck is going on here? </i>
		</p>
		<p>Taking a deep breath in a vain attempt to dispel some of her aggravation, she picked up the phone again and dialed a familiar number.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Hello?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Has Eric Chalmers dropped off the face of the earth, or is it just me?" the writer snarled into the phone.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Well, hello to you too, dear. I'm fine…thanks for asking."</b>
		</p>
		<p>Having been properly chastised, the young woman sighed and began again. "I'm sorry. Hi, Charly. How's my favorite publisher?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Your 'only' publisher is fine,"</b> the older woman chuckled at the long running tease between them. Then sobering, she added,
			<b>"And as for your 'Mr. Wonderful,' I'm afraid I have no clue. Although, from the almost daily activity with your bank account, I'd venture to say that dear Mr. Chalmers hasn't wandered far."</b>
		</p>
		<p>Megan felt the hairs on the back of her neck begin to bristle. "What's that supposed to mean?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"It means, honey, that Eric has been making good use of the ATM card that you provided him with - to the tune of about fifteen thousand dollars so far. He's been hitting the ATM machines just about every day. The only reason it's not more is because there's a limit on how much he can take out in a one day period." </b> The silence on the other end was deafening. There was one thing that Charlotte Grayson never wanted to do; and that was hurt her young friend. But that, unfortunately, was just what was happening. There was no way around it though. Megan was not a child and, like it or not, she had to be made aware of these things.
		</p>
		<p>Knowing that, however, did not make the older woman feel any better.</p>
		<p>"Fine," the younger woman said, suddenly sounding very old. "Charly, can you please contact the bank for me and have them deactivate his ATM card? I think there are forms that have to be signed and, with you having power of attorney for me, you'll be able to do that. I know I'm asking a lot, but…"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Don't worry about it, baby,"</b> the older woman interrupted.
			<b>"That's one of the pitfalls…er…perks of being your 'unofficial' manager," </b>she kidded.
			<b> "It's also part of being a surrogate mom. Somebody's gotta look after your little blonde butt," </b>she added warmly.
		</p>
		<p>"And you do that very well," the blonde responded, with a thickness in her throat. "I'll never be able to thank you enough for what you've been for me over the years." The writer broke off quickly, needing a moment to regain her equilibrium.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Pshh, don't worry about it. I'll just come and live with you when I get too old and crotchety to work anymore."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"And I'll be more than happy to have your cantankerous old butt staying with me," the blonde responded cheekily, silently appreciating the older woman's attempt to lighten her mood.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Watch it, little girl, or I'll show you cantankerous when I see you."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Oooh, I'm scared," the blonde mock-shuddered. "Anyway," the blonde huffed out a breath. "Thanks a bunch, Charly. I owe you one." She thought for a moment, then added, "oh, and while you're at it, can you have them suspend Eric's credit card too. If Mr. Chalmers wants to pretend I don't exist, he's going to have to do it without my money. There shouldn't be any problems with the bank. But if there is, just have them call me here at Randi's house."</p>
		<p>
			<b>
				<i> "Oooh, it's not 'that woman' or 'the doctor' anymore. It's 'Randi' now," </i>
			</b> the older woman cheerfully noted.
			<b> "Speaking of the good doctor, how are things going?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>The subtle change of subject didn't go unnoticed, but Megan let it slide. Nor could she help but notice the hopeful optimism behind the question.</p>
		<p>Or the unexpectedly pleasant warmth that filled her when she thought of the tall doctor.</p>
		<p>"Things are going great," she smiled. "As a matter of fact, she took the splint off my leg today. And then she took me out to the porch so I could get some fresh air. She's got a great view of the mountains from one side of the porch. After a while, my leg started to get tired, so she sat me down in the bench swing on her porch, and went in and made some tea for us. After that, we just sat there for a while and talked."</p>
		<p>Charly was both amused and heartened by her friend's happy rambling.
			<b>
				<i> "She hasn't sounded this lighthearted in a long time." </i> "It sounds like Dr. Oakes has taken good care of you, my friend."
			</b>
		</p>
		<p>"She has," the writer admitted, guiltily. "She's been kind and gentle and patient. Even when I was acting like an ass, she was caring for me." The writer paused thoughtfully, then continued. " I owe her a great deal, Charly. More than I think I can ever repay."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"I don't think she ever cared about repayment,"</b> the older woman answered softly.
			<b>"I think that's just the way she is. I made those 'discreet inquiries' we talked about some weeks back, and everyone I was able to talk to said the same thing - that Randi was an outstanding physician. The key words I kept hearing were dedicated, hard working, gentle, caring. I could go on, but I think you get the idea. In other words,"</b> the publisher smiled,
			<b>"you lucked out, little one."</b>
		</p>
		<p>Megan lay her head back on the pillow as an indulgent smile crawled across her lips. "I believe you're right, Charly. As much as I hate to admit it, you were right from the beginning."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"In light of that admission, I'll refrain from saying 'I told you so' " </b>the publisher returned, with smug playfulness.
			<b>"So, how much longer before you're able to come home? Is the road up there going to be clear any time soon?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>Megan's head jerked up off the pillow as she remembered why she was trying to call Eric in the first place. "Yes, the road leading up here is just about finished. I was going to call you after I talked to Eric and let you know. My car is history, so Randi's checking with a company in Knox to see if they can provide a car and driver to bring me back home."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"You'll do no such thing, young lady,"</b> the publisher proclaimed.
			<b>"I'll send one of our cars for you. You just name the time and place."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"You don't have to do that, Charly," the writer admonished. "I don't want to put anyone to any trouble."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"You're not. These are company cars and company drivers, Meg. This is what they get paid to do. You're one of our most prolific and best selling authors. I would be remiss in my duties if I left you to find your own way back home. So, stop arguing with this 'cantankerous' old lady, and tell me when and where."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Well, um, I suppose Sunday will be good. I can have Randi take me into Cutter's Gap, and the car can pick me up there. I can call you back with a definite time frame," the writer finished in a much more subdued tone.</p>
		<p>The change in the younger woman's voice did not go unnoticed by the older woman, but she decided not to question it.
			<b> "That sounds wonderful, dear. It will be wonderful to have you back." </b>
		</p>
		<p>"It'll be wonderful to be back," the writer answered, hoping she sounded more enthusiastic than she felt. "Charly, I'm gonna let you go for now. I'm having the damnedest time keeping my eyes open."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"You go ahead and get your sleep, honey. I'll contact the bank first thing in the morning and start making the arrangements to come get you."</b> The publisher paused briefly as another thought forced its way to the forefront.
			<b> "Um, what should I tell him if he calls and wants to know why he's been cut off?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Just tell him it was my decision, and I'll discuss it with him when I return and not before."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"It will be my pleasure,"</b> the publisher purred.
			<b>"You get some rest now, and I'll see you in a few days. Sweet dreams, honey." </b>
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>
			<i>You go, girl! </i>The older woman mentally chortled as she hung up the phone.
			<i>You're growing up, opening your eyes, and gaining a backbone. It's beginning to look like that accident was the best thing that could have happened to you. I can't wait to meet your Dr. Oakes. She seems to be a most remarkable woman. </i> The publisher looked at the phone for a long moment, weighing, once again, professional ethics against maternal instincts. With a weary sigh, she reached for the receiver, as maternal instinct raised its fist in victory.
		</p>
		<p>While, many miles away, a young woman tossed and turned fitfully in her bed, completely at a loss to explain why her long-awaited return to 'civilization' wasn't making her feel as good as it should.
			<i>That's not so hard to figure out," </i> little Charly helpfully supplied, "
			<i>you don't want to leave her. Face it, Meggie, you've grown quite attached to the good doctor. You know that when you leave here, the chances of seeing Randi again are slim, and that's tearing you apart. </i> "But
			<b>why</b> does it hurt like this?" the young woman whispered plaintively. "I've had friends before that I've had to leave behind, and it never felt like this."
			<i> Because she has become so much more than a friend, little one. And someday soon, when you're ready, you'll understand. </i> "I don't want 'someday,' Goddammit," the blonde growled as she turned on her side and punched the pillow into submission. "I want to understand 'now' why I can't stand the thought of leaving her. I want to understand why I care so much for someone who represents everything I hate. I want to understand why I feel so warm and safe in her arms. And I
			<b>really</b> wanna understand why I get a warm tingling in my stomach when I watch her work out. I'm not like that…am I? Damn you, mother! Where are you when I need answers? Where are you when I need
			<b>you</b>?" Frustrated and confused, the young woman buried her face in the pillow and let silent tears fall.
		</p>
		<p>And down the hall, another young woman lay prone in her bed, staring at the ceiling. Torn between happiness and heartache, the tall woman paid no heed to the abundant tears that made lazy trails down her cheeks. She was profoundly happy for Megan's recovery and glad that the young woman would soon be able to return to her home and her friends. She was happy for Megan, true. But a very large part of her grieved for the fact that, when the young woman left, she would be taking Randi's heart with her.</p>
		<p>And right along with that, the only happiness that the doctor had known in such a long time.</p>
		<p>
			<i>It'll all be over in a few days, Uncle Jake. Come the weekend, she'll be able to kiss this town, and me, goodbye. She can get back to her life and her friends and forget we ever existed. I should be happy for her, Uncle Jake. Hell, I
				<b>am</b> happy for her, but it's gonna hurt so damn much. Is this the way it's always gonna be? Am I always going to lose the people I love? Have I been so bad that I don't deserve to be happy? Ever? I don't think I can take it much more, Uncle Jake.
			</i> " I can't," she whispered brokenly as she turned her face into the pillow and gave way to heartwrenching sobs.
		</p>
		<p>Two silent figures sat in the doorway, watching the tall body on the bed convulse in quiet sobs. Both animals shivered in empathic response to the profound sadness that radiated from this woman and the one down the hall. They looked at each other for a long moment, communicating on their own level, before the small, fair-haired one rose and ambled down the hall.</p>
		<p>With an audible sigh, the black Shepherd quietly padded across the room and eased herself up on the bed. With a gentleness that belied her size, she settled her large frame against the body of her friend.</p>
		<p>There would be no 'tough' approach this time. Nor any attempt to 'cuddle' the human out of her funk. No, the woman didn't need that this time. She just needed to know that she was not alone. And the beautiful black was there to provide that assurance. No matter how long it took.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Eighteen">
		<p>Saturday came entirely too fast, and both women spent the entire day trying to prepare, mentally and physically, for the writer's imminent departure. As a result, conversation was strained, and physical interaction was awkward at best. There was so much to say, but neither woman had the courage to say it.</p>
		<p>Dinner was a quiet affair, with both women doing little more than pushing the food around on their plates. Randi looked across the table at her petite patient.</p>
		<p>
			<i>She looks so sad. But why? She's finally getting out of here. That's what she's been wanting for months, so why isn't she kicking up her heels? Probably because of you, idiot! You're walking around here looking like a five year old that lost her puppy, and she doesn't want to make you feel any worse, so she's keeping a tight lid on any happiness she's feeling.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Well, that's gonna stop, </i>Randi decided, as she pulled her napkin off her lap and threw it on her plate. "Hey there," she addressed the blonde, startling her out of her depressed reverie. "It doesn't look like either one of us is very hungry, so why don't we just leave it. It's a pretty warm night, so why don't we go sit out on the porch? We can throw a few CD's on the player, and I can crack open a bottle of Merlot and we can celebrate your recovery and return to 'the World.'" This last part said with a mischievous wagging of her eyebrows.
		</p>
		<p>Megan saw the invitation for what it was; a sweetly subtle attempt to brighten her mood.
			<i>Still taking care of me, aren't you, doctor? </i> "That sounds wonderful," the blonde agreed.
		</p>
		<p>"So, what are your plans when you get back to the city?" Randi finally broached the subject that both women had been subtly avoiding. They had spent the evening sipping wine and discussing the weather, the history of Cutters Gap, the stars, everything but what the next day would bring. Now, the pregnant silence fairly screamed for one of them to step forward. And Randi complied.</p>
		<p>Megan gazed into the inky blackness of the surrounding forest, gathering thoughts that had become slightly muzzy from the three glasses of flavorful wine she had imbibed. Finally succeeding, she heaved a sigh. "I dunno, I guess I'll take a week to get things back in order. Do some editing on my current story, go through my mail, settle a couple of personal issues, things like that. Then, after that, let Charly re-schedule my book signings, and…go on from there, I guess." She turned and studied the graceful profile of the woman sitting next to her. "What about you. What'll you do?"</p>
		<p>Randi shrugged noncommittally. "Same as what I've been doing, I guess. Putter around the house, finish cleaning the attic, rescue another cute blonde," she concluded with a lopsided grin.</p>
		<p>"Funny girl," the writer shot back with an answering grin, then sobering, she said, "Can I ask you a personal question?"</p>
		<p>Warning bells sounded in Randi's head. "You can ask. No guarantees on an answer, though."</p>
		<p>"Fair enough," the blonde responded. "Randi, I know from first hand experience that you're an outstanding doctor. You have a God given talent for healing. And I'm not just talking about mending bodies. "The blonde paused in brief reflection before smiling gently. "You do wonders for troubled spirits, too. But I think you already know this. My question is, why are you hiding this wondrous gift away in a lonely house on a hill? Why aren't you actively practicing, either here or at the hospital in Knox?"</p>
		<p>The brunette closed her eyes against the pain that washed over her, threatening to pull her under.
			<i> I knew this was coming. </i> "I did work at Knox for a while. I completed my residency there," she responded listlessly.
		</p>
		<p>"So, why aren't you still there?"</p>
		<p>"Because I don't deserve to be there," she spit out with a vehemence that startled the writer.</p>
		<p>"Can you tell me why you feel that way?" the writer inquired gently.</p>
		<p>Megan watched silently as a flurry of emotions flitted across the chiseled features of the taller woman, mute testimony to the struggle within. Finally, "I can't, Megan," she whispered hoarsely, dropping her head. "I'm sorry…I just can't."</p>
		<p>Saddened and frustrated as she was, the young woman let the issue drop. Both women sat in contemplative silence for long moments as Trisha Yearwood crooned in the background, until Megan could take no more. She knew what song was coming next, and decided
			<i>What the hell, why not? </i> The young woman stood up, pausing for a moment to gather her equilibrium.
			<i>Whoa, good wine. </i>
		</p>
		<p>She then reached her hand out to the still seated doctor. "Dance with me?"</p>
		<p>Randi's head shot up, her face reflecting her surprise. "Here? Now?"</p>
		<p>"Why not?" the blonde smiled.</p>
		<p>Randi took the proffered hand and stood. Feeling awkward and unsure, she kept hold of the hand and placed her other hand tentatively on the blonde's shoulder as the opening music of the next song began.</p>
		<p>Megan was hard pressed not to giggle at the endearing shyness of the normally confident doctor. Deciding to take the bull by the horns, she looked up into impossibly blue eyes and sang along with the opening words of the song.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Don't be afraid to hold me tight, you know I won't break in two. What we're doing here tonight, sure beats what we're going through." </b>
		</p>
		<p>The young blonde smiled as the words had their intended effect, as the tall woman moved in closer, sliding her hand from Megan's shoulder to the small of her back. Satisfied, Megan sighed and placed her head on the warm, familiar shoulder.</p>
		<p>We both loved and lost before</p>
		<p>Know the sadness it can bring</p>
		<p>Tonight let's close the door</p>
		<p>And hold on to the nearest thing.</p>
		<p>Let's keep hanging on</p>
		<p>So we won't fall apart</p>
		<p>Let's make love tonight</p>
		<p>Like we never had a broken heart</p>
		<p>Warning bells rang madly in the tall woman's head as she held the smaller body close to her own.
			<i>I shouldn't be doing this. She's young, she's lonely, and she's feeling the effects of the wine. Hell, we
				<b>both</b> are. But this feels so good…so perfect…as if we've done this in countless other lifetimes. Just a few more minutes…that's all…then we'll stop.
			</i>With that, Randi's heart closed the door on those warning bells as the tall woman sighed and rested her cheek on a silky blonde head.
		</p>
		<p>Don't be afraid to close your eyes</p>
		<p>Pretend I'm someone that you love</p>
		<p>And I won't have to tell you lies</p>
		<p>'Cause it's not you I'm thinking of</p>
		<p>Let's keep hanging on</p>
		<p>So we won't fall apart</p>
		<p>Let's make love tonight</p>
		<p>Like we never had a broken heart.</p>
		<p>Megan was lost somewhere between ecstasy and awe. She had slow danced with Eric before, but it never felt as good…as perfect, as it did right now. The arms that held her close made her feel so cherished that it almost hurt. The long, lean body pressed so close to hers provoked responses from certain areas on her body so intense that it did hurt. And the heart beat, oh, that wonderfully intense rhythm that bounded against her ear somehow seemed to keep time with her own. There was only one small problem.
			<i>She's a woman! It's not supposed to feel this good.
				<b>I'm</b> not supposed to feel this good!
			</i>As the music chorus swelled, Megan made the mistake of looking up…and falling into twin pools of ocean blue.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Oh! I like that color. Is that what they look like when…</i> Her thoughts trailed off as the magic of the moment and the feel of the body moving against her effectively silenced them.
		</p>
		<p>Tonight we'll just pretend</p>
		<p>We've been in love right from the start</p>
		<p>Let's make love tonight</p>
		<p>Like we never had a broken heart.</p>
		<p>Almost as if they had a mind of their own, Megan's hands began to move. One of them pressed against the small of the taller woman's back and pressed firmly, melding both bodies tight, while the other hand tangled itself in silky, midnight hair. Gentle pressure brought the unresisting head closer as the blonde whispered the songs final line against full red lips.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Don't be afraid to close your eyes."</b>
		</p>
		<p>Megan's lips were sweet. Sweeter than Randi could ever have imagined. And she imagined quite a bit. And so it was no surprise that the tall woman drank greedily of the sweetness she had found there.</p>
		<p>No surprise that the fingers running through her hair sent electric tingles running through her body-tingles that ran from her head to her toes before finally settling in her belly.</p>
		<p>And started a fire there.</p>
		<p>No surprise that her thigh instinctually pressed against two smaller ones - that her tongue slid against soft lips, begging entrance.</p>
		<p>And thighs and lips parted for her.</p>
		<p>And certainly no surprise when her forays into those two places produced a very needy whimper.</p>
		<p>From a very lonely, very horny, very drunk
			<b>homophobic</b> young woman.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Dear lord, what am I doing? </i> Randi's eyes flew open and she jerked away as if burned. Her withdrawal so abrupt that the blonde limpet attached to her nearly fell.
		</p>
		<p>"Randi, what…?"</p>
		<p>"We can't do this."</p>
		<p>"Yes we can," the blonde protested as she stood on tiptoes, desperately trying to reach those delicious, full, wet lips.</p>
		<p>"No, we can't," the brunette reiterated hoarsely as she gently held the blonde at bay.</p>
		<p>"Why," the smaller woman whined pitifully. She was more than a little aroused, and her level of intoxication only added to the feeling that she would perish if she didn't get relief…and soon.</p>
		<p>"Because you're drunk."</p>
		<p>"I am not," the blonde insisted, silently wishing it was not so damned hard to focus on the woman in front of her.</p>
		<p>"Yes, you are," Randi retorted, gentling her tone. "Megan, right now you're lonely, you're aroused, and more than a little tipsy. You may think you want this right now, but in the morning you'll feel very differently."</p>
		<p>"No I won't," the blonde growled, her temper rising to the fore.</p>
		<p>"Yes you will. You'll look at me in the morning and see a woman who took advantage of you in a weak moment. In your eyes I'll be that vicious, immoral sexual predator you think all gay women are…and you'll hate me for it."
			<i>Worse than that, my love, you'll hate yourself…for letting it happen. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Megan ceased her amorous advances, becoming completely still; she hung her head in defeat. Noting the seeming surrender, Randi removed her hands from the smaller woman. "Megan, I…"</p>
		<p>Randi's head rocked back from the force of the stinging slap that connected with her face.</p>
		<p>"You're wrong," the blonde spat hotly. "I already hate you. Damn you, Randi Oakes! Damn you!"</p>
		<p>The next sound Randi heard was the slamming of the screen door as she watched the blonde race down the hall to her room.</p>
		<p>And then there was only silence.</p>
		<p>Randi stood on the empty porch rubbing her stinging cheek. Her pleasant buzz had fled into the night. Her raging libido had tucked it's tail and followed.</p>
		<p>Now there was only emptiness.</p>
		<p>And pain.</p>
		<p>And Megan's words ringing in her head.</p>
		<p>
			<i>
				<b>"I hate you. Damn you, Randi Oakes! Damn you!"</b>
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>Randi's legs lost their battle as the heartsick woman sank to her knees and broke into wrenching sobs.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Nineteen">
		<p>Saturday morning came and went, with both women maintaining a not so subtle distance between them. Conversation was minimal, at best. Reduced to short questions, and even shorter answers. Both women showed signs of the prior sleepless night. As evidenced by their haggard expressions and the listlessness of their movements.</p>
		<p>But neither was willing to talk about it.</p>
		<p>It still hurt too much.</p>
		<p>"Are you ready?" Randi was standing by the open passenger door, watching the blonde bid a tender farewell to the two canines that, by their subdued behavior, weren't happy this morning either.</p>
		<p>"You have no idea how ready," the blonde sniped as she climbed into her seat and yanked the door closed.</p>
		<p>Randi sighed as she walked around the jeep and got in.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Megan was pleasantly surprised as she walked into Toby's Gas and Grocery. It seemed the big man had made some changes in the past couple of months. Shelves and racks had been rearranged and moved back, to create a large open space in the front half of the store. A space that was now occupied by three small, cozy round tables with chairs. Each table wore a tablecloth decorated with a homey, checkerboard design. A small vase filled with an assortment of wildflowers completed each table.</p>
		<p>
			<i>I like it, </i> the young woman mused as a small smile, her first of the day, creased her face.
		</p>
		<p>"From the smile on your face, I'd say it meets with your approval, Ms. Megan."</p>
		<p>Megan turned to face the owner of the deep, rumbling voice, a deeper smile etching her face. "Very much so." She held out her hand in greeting and it was immediately enclosed by two big, warm, callused ones and held for a long moment as kindly gray eyes examined her. "It's good to see you again, little one. I was sorry about your accident, but I'm glad that Randi found you and took care of you. Are you all right now?"</p>
		<p>"I'm fine," the blonde reassured. "Dr. Oakes did take good care of me and, now that the roads are clear, I'm headed home."</p>
		<p>"Yes, Randi told me that you had a car coming for you." The older man was slightly surprised at Megan's use of Randi's title, instead of her given name. It was his understanding, from conversations with the raven-haired doctor, that they were getting along well. Now, he wasn't so sure. And, noticing the weary, pained look the young woman was trying to hide, he decided not to ask questions. "Why don't you have a seat and let me get you something to eat while you're waiting?"</p>
		<p>The mere thought of food made the writer's stomach turn. "I'm, uh, I'm really not hungry right now, Toby. Something to drink would be nice though," she offered as she sat down.</p>
		<p>"That's fine, Ms. Megan, I'll…"</p>
		<p>Both heads turned at the tinkling of the doorbell announcing Randi's entrance.</p>
		<p>The older man was hard pressed to stifle a gasp at the pale, haggard appearance of the woman he had come to think of as a daughter.
			<i>Dear lord, she hasn't looked like that since…What the devil's going on here? </i> Wisely choosing to save his questions for later, Toby broke into a big smile and boomed, "there's my girl. Please excuse me for a moment, Ms. Megan. Terry," he called to a petite, tow-headed girl who was sitting at another table, talking with a red headed woman. "Please get Ms. Megan a hot chocolate." With that, he walked away.
		</p>
		<p>Megan watched the beautiful brunette walk in the door and pause, her crystal blue gaze seeking, and immediately locating, her old friend and former patient. In spite of the brunette's haggard appearance, the writer's reaction was as immediate as it was unstoppable.
			<i> God, she's beautiful. </i>Megan's face screwed up in disgust at the unbidden thought, and she cursed her rebellious heart for its suddenly rapid beat.
			<i>Stop it! You don't want her. You don't need her. You don't even
				<b> like</b> her. She's just like all the rest. Remember that!
			</i>She scolded, tearing her eyes from the tall beauty, and finding the tablecloth pattern extremely interesting.
		</p>
		<p>So intense was Megan's perusal of the tabletop, that she never noticed Toby's departure, nor the arrival of her chocolate until it was placed in front of her. Startled, she looked up into friendly brown eyes. "Sorry about that," the writer offered. "Woolgathering."</p>
		<p>"No problem," the girl smiled, offering her hand. "I'm Terry."</p>
		<p>"Nice to meet you," the writer smiled back, taking the proffered hand. "I'm Megan."</p>
		<p>"I know. You write the Samantha Steele mysteries." The girl beamed, then paused before adding shyly," um, could you, um, if you don't mind, would you sign my book?</p>
		<p>"I'd be delighted," the writer smiled.</p>
		<p>"Great! I'll be right back." With that, she sprinted toward the back of the store. Megan heaved an amused sigh and sipped her chocolate.
			<i>Mmmm, delicious. This can't be instant. I'll have to see if I can get Toby to tell me how he makes it. </i> Megan's eyes automatically shifted to the front of the store where the big man stood in earnest conversation with the younger woman. She couldn't hear what was being said but from their body language, he with one big hand clasping her arm and the other gently cupping her face, and she leaning into the caress while nodding agreeably, Megan could pretty much guess what was being said.
			<i>He's comforting her. She looks like I feel and he's trying to comfort her. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Megan couldn't suppress the surge of envy that washed through her as she watched the tender interaction between the two.
			<i> Is that what it's supposed to be like with a father and daughter? </i>
		</p>
		<p>"Must be nice," she mumbled with some bitterness as she took another sip of her chocolate and resumed her study of the tablecloth.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Randi stepped gingerly into the cheerful warmth of the little store. She had put it off as long as she could, filling the jeep with gas, checking the fluids, washing the windows, and any other little thing she could do that would keep her away from the two people that could very easily bring her to tears right now. Toby, with his loving concern, and Megan with her biting words. Not that she could blame the young woman. Megan needed something from Randi last night. Something that the raven-haired woman was unwilling to give. The reasons seemed clear enough last night. But now, in the cold, clear light of day, the doctor had to wonder if they were reasons…or excuses. A way to keep the blonde at arms distance, prevent her from knowing
			<b>all</b> of Randi. And, upon that knowing, finding her wanting…and then she would leave…just like everyone else Randi loved.
			<i> Not that it matters. She's leaving today, anyway. So, maybe everything worked out exactly like it should. </i> Randi stood for a moment, taking in the changes to the interior.
			<i> Nice</i>, she thought briefly before setting sight on the big man and the small blonde. She winced internally as she noted the shock that flashed across the big man's face before he concealed it with a big smile and a loud proclamation of "There's my girl."
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>I must look like shit, </i> she mused as her eyes flicked briefly to the seated blonde, whose expression was one of schooled indifference.
			<i>She doesn't look much better. Even so, she's still beautiful. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Any further musing was cut short, as she was engulfed in the warm and loving embrace of her 'uncle.'</p>
		<p>An embrace that, contrary to her intentions, she melted into with a desperate abandon that she hadn't felt since she was a young girl.</p>
		<p>Finally, the long, massive arms released their willing captive just enough for the big man to study the younger woman. Callused hands kept a gentle but firm grip on her shoulders as he studied her face.</p>
		<p>"You're not looking good, Princess," the big man rumbled softly. "You sounded better than this on the phone the other day. What happened, honey?"</p>
		<p>Randi dropped her head, and watery blue eyes squeezed shut in an effort to bind the tears that threatened to fall. "I can't go into it right now, Uncle Toby," she whispered hoarsely. "Let's just say that I failed somebody again."</p>
		<p>A large hand cupped her chin and lifted her head until liquid blue eyes were confronted with stormy gray ones.</p>
		<p>"Now you listen to me, Randi Christine Oakes," the old man growled. "You didn't fail anybody the
			<b>first</b> time. You can't take responsibility for someone else's actions. You can't blame yourself for not being there if you don't get the call. And you most certainly can't prevent the inevitable. You're a doctor, Randi, and you know it's the truth." The stormy gray eyes gentled as the storekeeper placed a soft kiss on an ebony eyebrow. "And someday soon, your heart's going to accept it too. I have faith in that…in you." The large hand moved from her chin, to cup her cheek. "We'll talk more about this new problem later," he promised, getting a small nod in agreement. "But right now you need a good cup of old Toby's coffee. Now go find you seat. I'll be right back."
		</p>
		<p>Randi looked toward the table area, or, more specifically, at one table in particular, and hesitated.
			<i>Maybe I should stay outside for a while longer. </i> Then, remembering something that she carried in her back pocket, decided.
			<i>What the hell. Not much she can say that hasn't already been said. </i> With a resigned sigh, the tall woman approached the blonde's table.
		</p>
		<p>Cool green eyes lifted and studied her briefly. "What?"</p>
		<p>Randi reached into her back pocket for the diskettes and placed them on the table. "You left these on the nightstand. If you've got any of your writing on them, you'll want to keep them…to make sure you have a backup."</p>
		<p>Megan had left them there intentionally. She wanted to take as little as possible away from this encounter, but the tall woman made a good point. "Thank you," she replied coolly. I'll be sure to add these to the reimbursement check. Along with the clothes I'm wearing."'</p>
		<p>Randi shook her head. "That isn't necessary. I've got tons of empty discs that I don't need. And, as for the clothes, hell, I haven't worn them since I was a teenager. They're just old jeans and sweats that I left here when I went away to college. I figured Jake would toss them out, but, being the packrat he is, he put them up in the attic instead."</p>
		<p>"Be that as it may," the blonde replied crisply. "I still intend to pay for them. I don't want to owe you for anything, Dr. Oakes. Not a blessed thing."</p>
		<p>Randi ran her fingers through her hair and blew out a frustrated breath. "You don't owe me anything! At first, I took care of you because it was the right thing to do. And later on, it was because I
			<b>wanted</b> to…because I
			<b>cared</b>. Just like I cared last night. I couldn't let you do something you'd be sorry for later on. If I was wrong…I'm sorry. If I offended you…I'm sorry."
		</p>
		<p>Somewhere down deep, the writer knew the truth of Randi's words. The tall woman only ever acted in her patient's best interest. But that truth was buried deep beneath the anger and pain of being rejected yet again by someone she…
			<i>loved</i>? "Tell me, doctor; do you often make decisions for others, and have to apologize for it later? Is that what you did to your beloved Casey? Is that why she left you?"
		</p>
		<p>Randi rocked back as if it were a physical blow. Her face became a pale, expressionless mask. But the eyes that stared into Megan's revealed a depth of pain that took the younger woman's breath away.</p>
		<p>Without a word, the tall woman turned and walked away.</p>
		<p>Megan watched the retreating figure in stunned silence, completely unaware of her equally stunned audience. Until the thump of a coffee mug being set on the table got her attention. She looked up into gray eyes that reflected both anger and deep disappointment.</p>
		<p>"That was wrong, Ms. Megan. That was just plain wrong," the old man rumbled before striding briskly out the door in search of the distraught doctor.</p>
		<p>"And this day just keeps getting better," the blonde mumbled into her cup, trying desperately to ignore the guilt that was creeping up her spine.</p>
		<p>She couldn't ignore, however, the slim, silent woman that seemed to simply appear, and who now stood eyeing her critically.</p>
		<p>"You're Megan Galagher, the writer." It was more a statement than a question.</p>
		<p>"Yes, I am," the blonde responded warily. The woman didn't appear threatening, but she didn't seem all that friendly either.</p>
		<p>"You tell good stories, Ms. Galagher. If you don't mind, I'd like a few moments of your time. I'd like to tell you a story."</p>
		<p>
			<i>You've
				<b>got</b> to be kidding me! I don't need this.
			</i> "I'm not sure," she made a point of checking her watch. "Someone's supposed to be picking me up any time now."
		</p>
		<p>A small, knowing smile curved pink lips. "It won't take long, Ms. Galagher. I really think you need to hear this story."</p>
		<p>"Fine," the blonde acquiesced. "Please, have a seat."</p>
		<p>"Thank you," the willowy redhead smiled as she sat down. Clasping her hands in front of her, the redhead took a deep breath and began.</p>
		<p>"Once upon a time," she began, quirking a wry grin at the fairy tale beginning she was using. "There was this beautiful little princess who became very ill one night. So ill in fact, that she had to be brought to the emergency room of a hospital. And the little princess was very scared. She couldn't understand why she was having such trouble breathing, and to make matters worse, all these big people were wearing masks and doing all kinds of uncomfortable things to her without telling her why. So the princess began to cry and squirm, trying to make these masked people leave her alone, but they wouldn't. And then, someone else walked into her room. Someone very tall, with long, dark hair and very blue eyes. This tall person spoke very briefly with the other people in the room, and then walked over to the princess' bed. Then she did something that none of the other big people did; she took the princess' hand in hers, and then she pulled the mask down from her face. She smiled at the princess and said, 'hi, I'm Randi, and I'd like to try and make you feel better. Will you help me do that?' The princess liked the doctor's pretty smile and the fact that the doctor was actually talking
			<b>to</b> her, so she let doctor Randi and the other big people help her. Unfortunately, it was discovered that she had AIDS. It was a 'gift' from her daddy that mommy never knew about. Because of that, the princess had occasion to visit the hospital more often than she would have liked. And she became very good friends with the pretty doctor." Here, the redhead paused thoughtfully as a bittersweet smile creased her lips. "No, they became so much more than friends. The princess worshipped the ground that doctor Randi walked on. And everyone knew that the doctor felt the same way. For she doted on the princess as no one else ever had, except for her mommy."
		</p>
		<p>The redhead paused in her tale long enough to take a sip of her coffee and gather the courage she would need to finish the story. Megan was, by now thoroughly engrossed in the other woman's story, even though she had a sinking feeling she knew how it would end.
			<i> But what the hell does this have to do with me, and why did she think I needed to hear it? </i> Nevertheless, the writer listened intently as the redhead began again.
		</p>
		<p>"Two years passed. Two years in which the princess and her mommy had many fun times with the good doctor. Unfortunately, the fun would not last. For the princess came down with a cold that, very quickly turned into pneumonia. Once again, she was brought to the hospital, and once again the good doctor was there for her. The princess would spend many days in the hospital, struggling very valiantly to fight her sickness, and doctor Randi would spend every possible moment watching over her. But doctor Randi was also working double shifts in the emergency room because of a staff shortage. By the end of the week, doctor Randi was near collapse and her supervisor ordered her to leave the hospital for at least twenty-four hours so that she could rest. Randi didn't want to leave the princess, but she had no choice. So she went home. Now, at the time, doctor Randi was seeing a young lady named Jenna. Jenna was very nice, and she cared a great deal for the doctor. But she was also of a mind that the doctor worked entirely too hard. So when doctor Randi was sent home to rest, Jenna took it upon herself to make sure that the doctor did just that. For when the doctor fell asleep, Jenna unplugged the phone and turned off her pager and cell phone. As fate would have it, the princess' health took a dramatic turn for the worst. The nurses tried many times to contact the doctor, to no avail. No one knows what woke the doctor out of a sound sleep, but awaken she did, and she automatically checked her pager, only to find it had been turned off. When she turned it on and saw the messages, she set out for the hospital immediately, knowing without question that her princess needed her. Alas, by the time she got there, it was too late. The princess was in full cardiac arrest, and nothing doctor Randi did, not medicine, not electric shock, nor pleading, would bring her back. And when she died, Doctor Randi Oakes died too. She left her job, her career, her friends, Jenna. She left them all. She came back here and exiled herself to that damn house on the hill, refusing all contact from those that loved her and would offer comfort she felt she didn't deserve. For she loved the princess so; and blamed herself for the princess' death; believing with all her poor heart that if she had gotten there sooner, she could have saved her. But she's wrong. Nothing she could have done would have saved the princess. The little one was simply too tired to keep fighting, and so the Angels took her home.
			<b>We</b> all know that; and someday, with our help, Randi will know it too." Piercing amber eyes caught and held solemn green ones. "Little
			<b>Casey</b> Tucker would want it that way."
		</p>
		<p>Green eyes widened in comprehension and a guilty flush stole over pale cheeks as the writer lowered her head. "I didn't know," she whispered.</p>
		<p>"No, you didn't," the redhead agreed. "You didn't know the first thing about it, but you slapped her across the face with it anyway. That's a pretty lousy thing to do to a woman who saved your life, took you into her home, and cared for you for two months."</p>
		<p>Megan bristled at the condemnation in the woman's tone, as defensiveness overcame guilt. "Look, you don't know me, and you don't know what happened. I had my reasons." She hissed.</p>
		<p>The redhead cocked an eyebrow. "Did you, now?" Rising out of her chair, the redhead leaned over, placing both palms flat on the table and stared directly into defiant green eyes. "You're right, I don't know you. But I do know Randi. She is the sweetest, kindest, gentlest and most caring individual I've ever known, and I can't think of a single thing she could have done to deserve what I've seen today."</p>
		<p>The woman straightened to full height and shook her head. "You may be a fine writer, Ms. Galagher, but you're not a nice person." With that, she walked away.</p>
		<p>Too flustered to offer any retort, the writer simply sat and stared as the redhead walked out the door. Finally, regaining some composure, she picked up her lukewarm drink. "Who in the hell does she think she is, anyway," she grumbled.</p>
		<p>"That was Amy Tucker…Casey's' mother," the tow-headed waitress responded, placing a paperback book on the table. "You can keep this. I don't think I want it anymore," she added before she too walked away, leaving the writer with only her misery for company.</p>
		<p>Before long, a cream-colored luxury sedan pulled up in front of the store. Catching sight of it, the blonde bolted up from the table and was out the door before the vehicle had a chance to park. Whipping open the back door, Megan let out a happy cry as she clambered into the car and into the surprised arms of her publisher friend.</p>
		<p>"Well, I've certainly missed you too," the publisher drawled with amusement to the trembling body clinging to her.
			<i> "Trembling? </i>" The publisher gently disengaged the clinging blonde and leaned back a little, trying to do a visual inspection. "Honey, are you…is everything okay?"
		</p>
		<p>"Everything's fine, Charly. Can we just go?"</p>
		<p>"Well…of course we can," the older woman offered hesitantly. "I was hoping to meet the delightful doctor Oakes, though. I wanted to offer my personal thanks for her taking such good care of you. Is she not here?" the older woman inquired, looking around.</p>
		<p>"No," the blonde responded, a little too quickly for the publisher's liking. "Dr. Oakes something to do. She had to leave. You can thank her with a check when we get back home," she finished coolly.</p>
		<p>"
			<i>Ouch</i>" "All right, my young friend," gentle fingers grasped the younger woman's chin. "What's going on here?" she inquired sternly.
		</p>
		<p>Liquid green eyes searched warm brown ones, pleading. "Not here, Charly…not now. Please. I just want to go home."</p>
		<p>The publisher heaved a frustrated sigh. "Fine. But we're going to have a long talk when we get home, Megan." With that, she addressed the driver. "Let's go, Jim."</p>
		<p>The car began moving and the blonde sank wearily into the plush leather seat. Turning her head to the window as they moved away, she took a last look at the quaint little store she would likely never see again.</p>
		<p>And emitted a quiet gasp at the sight of the big man who stood next to the building.</p>
		<p>Holding on tightly to the familiar, tall body that convulsed with sobs she could not hear.</p>
		<p>It was a sight that would haunt her for a very long time.</p>
