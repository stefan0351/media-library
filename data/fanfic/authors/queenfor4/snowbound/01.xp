		<p>"Mmmm, yesss,"</p>
		<p>She was having a wonderful dream. A warm wet tongue was lightly teasing her ear, and it was feeling rather good. Then something very cool and not so wet plunged directly in her ear and exhaled in a loud 'Snoof'.</p>
		<p>"Yaahhh!"</p>
		<p>Her head shot straight up off the pillow. Her heart hammering, she looked around wildly. Then her eyes settled on a dark figure sitting next to her bed. The black triangular head tilted slightly, and blue eyes studied her with mischievous curiosity.</p>
		<p>She lowered herself back down and turned so that she was nose to nose with the furry face. She glared at the unrepentant animal.</p>
		<p>"You can be replaced with a goldfish at any time, you know."</p>
		<p>Her answer was a belligerent growl and a muted 'woof'. She narrowed her eyes and opened her mouth for a retort, but the canine turned her back on her and sauntered to the bedroom door and paused, looking back at her expectantly.</p>
		<p>Gazing at the dawning sunlight that snuck through her curtained window, she flopped over on her back and sighed. Feeling a slight movement at her feet, she looked down at the small butter golden canine that lay curled by her feet. The animal looked at her with sleepy, sympathetic eyes, then lowered her head back to her paws and closed her eyes.</p>
		<p>Randi sat up and gently nudged the animal on her back and lightly scratched her belly.</p>
		<p>"Oh no ya don't. If I have to get up with the dragon lady, so do you," she informed the squirming, stretching animal that decided if she had to get up, then this was a most pleasant way to do it.</p>
		<p>Randi climbed out of bed and padded down the hallway, flanked by her furry companions. She stopped by the kitchen to pour herself a cup of freshly brewed coffee and silently thanked whatever gods might be listening for coffee makers with automatic timers. She continued on through the spacious livingroom to the foyer, where she opened the front door for her four legged friends. They both shot through the door and down the steps of the porch, scurrying into the woods to take care of business. Once finished, they got down to the serious business of playing.</p>
		<p>Randi stood and watched the playful pair as they ran and wrestled in the crisp, early autumn air, wondering once again where this unlikely pair came from. They had just shown up on her property one day. The little one had been hurt; blood matted her fur from shoulder to mid-chest. She limped along gamely, being nudged, coaxed, and almost dragged by her midnight-black companion. They made it halfway to the porch before the smaller animal gave up and just lay down. The larger animal sat down beside her and alternated between looking up at Randi and giving little nudging licks to her exhausted companion. Randi took the hint and approached the pair slowly, murmuring softly so as not to alarm them. Gentle cinnamon eyes regarded her patiently as she gently examined the bloody shoulder of the smaller animal. The tall woman winced at the long deep gashes that marred the silken fur. "Well, this is bad," she said to herself as much as to the ebony canine that watched her intently. "But it can be fixed. You're going to have to let me get her inside if I'm going to help her." And, as if understanding, the larger animal backed up and let the woman pick up the little one and bring her inside. Randi sutured the little canine's wounds and made a place in the kitchen for her to rest and recover. The larger animal never left her side, except to answer nature's call and take small amounts of food and water that Randi provided. The little one recovered fairly quickly and, as if by unspoken agreement, they had been with the solitary woman ever since. Their devotion to each other, much like their sudden appearance in her life, was a mystery, but Randi had to admit, she enjoyed it.</p>
		<p>Randi shook herself out of her reverie and looked up, taking note of the heavy gray clouds that were moving in quickly and efficiently, overtaking the sun.
			<i>This doesn't look good, </i>she mused to herself. Walking back inside the house, she flicked on the radio on her way to the kitchen. The radio was tuned to a local country music station, and she listened to Wynona rocking to the rhythm of the rain as she toasted a bagel and rummaged in the refrigerator for some cream cheese. She munched idly through the news and sports, paying close attention when Kip Kilbourne's too cheerful voice began to announce the weather.
		</p>
		<p>"Well folks, it's time to stock up your pantries and break out those snowshoes. This is going to be a big one. There's a high-pressure system moving our way from the great white north, and it's gonna meet up with another fast moving front from the east. And three guesses where they're gonna meet up with each other. You got it! Cutters Gap, Pike Mountain, and surrounding areas are going to be hit hard. Snowfall should begin about mid-day today, and I don't look for it to stop until late Friday. Now this is Tuesday, folks. So think about that while you prepare. Especially you guys up there on the ridge, 'cause it's likely going to be a while before you can make it down here again. We'll keep you posted as things develop."</p>
		<p>Randi sighed and ran her fingers through tousled raven hair, doing a mental inventory of what she would need to tide her over for at least five weeks. For that would likely be how long it took before the road leading to and from her secluded hilltop home would be clear. The list would be short, as she had a fully stocked pantry and an abundance of meat in the freezer housed in the garage.
			<i>Perhaps some extra Kerosene for the emergency generator and another 50 pound bag of dog food for my furry friends, </i>she mused to herself.
			<i>Ooohh, and maybe Toby has gotten a new shipment of paperbacks in. Reading fanfic on the net is fine, but it's not real comfy reading when I'm in bed, even on the laptop. Ugh, I guess I'd better get this over with.</i> Finishing her coffee in one gulp, she headed back to her room to shower and dress for the dreaded trip to Cutters Gap.
		</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Two">
		<p>"Shit, shit, shit!"</p>
		<p>Megan Galagher was lost. And she was not happy. What was supposed to be a 'scenic' route back to her native New York from a book signing in Manchester, NH was turning out to be the road trip from Hell. The attendant at the last gas station she stopped at '30 miles back' promised her that this road would lead her to the interstate within 20 miles.
			<i>Obviously he didn't know what in the Hell he was talking about.</i> She fumed to herself.
			<i>Now here I am, driving down this narrow-assed road, around a mountain that looks like it's about to go avalanche any minute, with no clue where I'm going, and no friggin' interstate signs in sight. AARRGGHHH!</i>
		</p>
		<p>She spotted a sign that read Cutters Gap 3MI and breathed a sigh of relief.
			<i>Thank you, God. Maybe they can give me some kind of clue how I can get to the interstate, or at least have a phone I can use to call the auto club and get directions and then, call my agent and let her know I'm still alive. My cell phone has been useless in these damn mountains. </i>Breathing a little easier, she pressed a little harder on the accelerator of her Lexus and headed into Cutters Gap.
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Randi navigated the winding road with a rumbling dread in her belly. She had driven this road, with its many sharp curves and 45 degree inclines, hundreds of times in the years she had lived here. The private road that led to and from her hilltop ranch was mostly treelined, but there were spots where the edge of the road dropped into little ravines, and if you weren't careful, you would find yourself losing the road and tumbling into the ravine. However the tall woman's dread had less to do with the road than it had to do with the trip into Cutters Gap. The people there were her friends, they had known the tall woman most of her life, but they knew. They knew of her shame. And after all this time she still saw the sympathetic looks, listened to the well-meaning advice to move on with her life. But she couldn't forget, couldn't move on, and couldn't bear the sympathy that she felt she did not deserve. So she became a recluse. Living a solitary life in her house high up on a hill that more closely resembled a mountain. Only venturing into town when she absolutely needed supplies.
			<i>I can do this,</i> she promised herself.
			<i>Get in quick; get out quick, no problem.</i> "Then why do I feel like I'm about to step into an alligator pit?" She said aloud to no one in particular.
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Megan drove her Lexus ES300 down the middle of a street that looked like a throwback to the 50s. Small shops lined one side of the street, and 'professional' buildings lined the other, with diagonal parking on both sides. The young strawberry blond eyed the passing storefronts, searching in vain for something familiar.
			<i>Jesus, no malls, no department stores, no Starbucks, not even a 'McDonald's. What part of the twilight zone have I wandered into? I don't even see a friggin payphone! </i>Driving on, and ignoring the curious looks from people, Megan's hopes were dwindling.
			<i>A gas station...I'll settle for a damn gas station. </i>As if in answer to her plea, the writer spotted a row of cheerful green gas pumps at the edge of town. Set well behind the pumps was what appeared, to Megan's grateful eyes, to be a rather expansive convenience store. The large sign above the entrance read simply: TOBY'S GAS &amp; GROCERY. "Thank you, Lord!" Megan sighed.
			<i>Maybe I can at least grab something to munch on and use their phone. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Looking around as she pulled on the lot, Megan spotted the familiar blue and white booth. Pulling into a parking space set between the store entrance and the phone, Megan gathered up her dayplanner and exited the car. Pausing outside the auto, the petite author breathed deeply of the crisp cold air and took a moment to look around. As much as she hated being lost in the middle of nowhere, she couldn't help but admire the rustic feel of the small town and the beauty of the surrounding hilly woods, lush with snowcapped pines. Looking up, Megan decided she really didn't like the looks of the rapidly graying sky.
			<i>All right Meg, sightsee later; take care of business now. </i>Moving to the phone, Megan pulled her calling card out of the dayplanner and picked up the handset.

	<chapter title="Chapter Three">
		<p>Charlotte Grayson was doing her best not to burst into flames as she patiently explained, once again, to the young writer on the phone that she could not provide him with a young woman so that he might perform some 'research' for the romance story he was working on.
			<i>God help me! What ever happened to 'cruising the bars' for a date?</i> The yodeling of her private phone interrupted her reverie.
			<i>Thank God!</i> "Look, Johnny, I've got an important call coming in. I can't help you with your 'research', you're gonna have to get a gal the old fashioned way; hit the bars." Disconnecting quickly, she grabbed her other phone, "Grayson" she barked.
		</p>
		<p>"What ever happened to 'hello'?" the chiding voice on the other end inquired.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Galagher!" </b>The redhead bellowed.
			<b> "Where on Gaia's green earth are you? I've been worried sick, you little shit. I haven't heard from you since you left Manchester. Your cell phone keeps telling me the party I'm trying to call is unavailable, and the weatherman's been damn near peeing himself over a major storm front that's coming through New Hampshire and Vermont on its way here. And we won't mention the book signing you're scheduled for at Barnes &amp; Noble next week." </b> The exasperated woman finished, finally drawing a breath.
		</p>
		<p>"I'm fine Charly, thanks for asking." The strawberry blond chuckled into the phone. "First off, I'm about one hundred miles outside of Manchester, in a town called Cutters Gap. I'm surrounded by mountains, which is why you can't reach me on the cell phone. I got a little lost while looking for the interstate, so I stopped here to use their phone to call you and then call the auto club to get some dependable directions to the interstate. Yes, I've noticed the weather is looking a bit nasty, but I should be able to get directions, grab something to eat and be well on the highway before the snow hits. Does that about cover everything?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Yeah, well," </b>the publisher replied, somewhat appeased,
			<b> "you should have called me sooner. I was worried...I mean, I can't have my star writing talent gallivanting around the countryside and missing her appointments." </b>
		</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Megan smiled at the publisher's weak attempt at disguising her concern. "I love you too, Charly." The writer chuckled. "But I'm okay, and I'll be home soon. How's Eric doing?" Megan inquired about her live-in boyfriend, causing the red-haired publisher to grimace and snort. </p>
		<p>
			<b>"Oh, he's missing you terribly, Meg; he only goes out on the town four nights a week instead of five,"</b> she answered with no small amount of sarcasm.
		</p>
		<p>Megan rolled her eyes. She was well aware of her publishing friend's dislike of her live-in lover. "Be nice, Charly. He's probably just lonely. I don't expect him to cloister himself in the apartment until I come home." She chided her friend. </p>
		<p>
			<b>"Whatever you say,"</b> the publisher grumbled.
		</p>
		<p>There was a pregnant silence before the petite blond said, "Look Charly, I've got to go. I want to grab something to eat and get directions before the snow starts falling. I'll call you when I get clear of these mountains." </p>
		<p>
			<b>"Sure thing Meg,"</b> the redhead replied.
			<b>"You be careful."</b>
		</p>
		<p>Megan hung up the phone and pulled her auto club card out and dialed the tollfree number.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Charlotte Grayson sighed heavily as she stared at the now silent phone. She worried about the young writer, perhaps unnecessarily as Megan often chided her, but she worried anyway. Megan Galagher had come a long way in the three years since Charlotte first saw one of the young woman's stories in an independent women's magazine. The publishing editor recognized the raw talent in that short tale and quickly sought out the author. They met for lunch in one of Manhattan's many small delis and Megan allowed her to read a rough manuscript featuring a beautiful, brainy, and deadly private investigator called Samantha Steele. And the rest, as they say, was history. The deadly detective became the heroine in several best selling mysteries, and Megan, the golden child of the book world. The older woman became her agent, friend, confidante, and surrogate mother. The last being a role that Charlotte would have gladly relinquished to the real thing, but Megan would have none of it. The friendship between the women was comfortable. Despite the twenty-year difference in their ages, they shared many of the same interests and saw eye-to-eye on almost everything.... Except Eric. Charlotte had not trusted the handsome, arrogant, and decidedly smooth young blond since she first laid eyes on him. The young man had simply appeared at one of Megan's' book signings bearing a red rose and exuding a hefty amount of humble charm. Megan fell for it hook, line, and sinker. And in no time at all, the unemployed drifter went from staying with friends to living in a New York high-rise, driving his own SUV, and sampling New York night life with a beautiful young author on his arm. Charlotte never hid her dislike or distrust of Megan's companion, but the writer steadfastly defended him, saying the older woman simply did not understand. In this one area, both women simply agreed to disagree. Before Megan left for her most recent book signing, the publisher hoped that he would go with her. He might be useless, but he would at least be company for her. </p>
		<p>Lover boy declined though, pleading carsickness on long trips. Now Megan was lost and alone, and in spite of the writer's upbeat attitude, Charlotte had a bad feeling.</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Four">
		<p>Megan let out an exasperated sigh as she listened to the overly cheerful recorded voice.
			<b>
				<i>"Thank you for calling Premier Auto Club, your 24 hour highway helpers. Due to heavy call volume, anticipated wait time for assistance is approximately 45 minutes. Please do not hang up and call back. This will only increase your wait time. Thank you for your patience." </i>
			</b>"45 minutes my ass!" The frustrated blond growled as she slammed down the receiver. "Oh well, maybe someone in here will know how I can get back to civilization."
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>A light snow was beginning to fall as Randi reached the fork that separated her road from the two-lane highway that led into Cutters Gap.
			<i>Huh, it's starting earlier than they said it would. It doesn't matter, I'll still be able to get in and out and back up the hill before it gets sloppy. </i>Checking briefly for any oncoming vehicles and seeing none, Randi punched the gas pedal and pulled onto the road that headed into town.
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Megan was pleasantly surprised when she entered Toby's Gas &amp; Grocery. The interior of the store was spacious, well lit, and seemed to have a little bit of everything. Off to her left were several mid-sized isles that carried the usual assortment of canned goods and sundries. The back wall sported two refrigerator cases. The long one carried an impressive variety of cold drinks, and the shorter one contained dairy products and cold cuts. Directly to her left there was a large cold case that held locally raised meats and poultry. Straight in front of her stood a long magazine rack that held a decent variety of magazines. There was even a section that boasted the latest in paperback books. Finally, to her right, a long counter that ran the length of the store. Half of which offered freshly prepared cold cut sandwiches and fountain sodas. The other half of the counter bearing the checkout registers.
			<i>Oh yeah, this will work,</i> Megan grinned to herself. Megan wandered up to the sandwich counter and eyed the selection of sandwiches listed on the handpainted sign.
		</p>
		<p>"Good morning, young lady! And how are you this morning?" Boomed a deep masculine voice. </p>
		<p>Megan turned at the greeting and watched as a mountain of a man ambled her way from the back of the store. He had to be at least 6'8", broad shouldered with thickly muscled arms. He had a barrel chest that tapered only slightly at his waist and thighs that resembled small tree trunks.
			<i>Good God! I've seen smaller mountains.</i> His shoulder length salt &amp; pepper hair was pulled back in a loose ponytail and his craggy face, though lined with age, was ruggedly handsome. As he approached her, it briefly occurred to Megan that she would hate to meet this man in a dark alley, but his warm open smile and gentle gray eyes quickly displaced that thought. Suddenly it occurred to Megan that she was gaping, and with a mental head slap she responded. "Oh! Uh, I'm fine. I was just looking at your sandwich selection and remembered that I skipped breakfast."
		</p>
		<p>"Well now," he replied, "a little thing like you shouldn't be missing meals, young lady." He passed her and reached behind the counter, pulling out a high wooden stool. Whipping a hand towel from his back pocket, he wiped off the already clean seat and placed it in front of the counter. "Why don't you have a seat and let me whip you up my famous Turkey Breast and Bacon Special?" Before Megan had a chance to reply, her empty stomach loudly rumbled its reply. The petite blond blushed prettily at the amused twinkle in his eyes. "I'll take that as a 'yes'," he chuckled. As he set about preparing her sandwich, curiosity got the better of her and she wandered over to the stand that held the paperbacks. </p>
		<p>"My name's Toby, by the way," the large man called from behind the counter. "And I'm sure you've heard this line before, but I swear you look familiar. Have you visited Cutters Gap before?"</p>
		<p>"No, I've never been to this area before," Megan replied. Her eyes twinkled merrily as she spied a certain book in the rack. She picked it up and walked back over and lightly plopped it on the counter. "But you may have seen me before." She offered cryptically. Toby turned and looked down at the counter. His eyes grew saucer wide as he looked down picture of the pretty, petite blond woman gracing the back cover of the book, and then back up to the meadow green eyes of the living thing.</p>
		<p>"Well, I'll be whipped," he exclaimed as he hurriedly wiped off his hands. "If it isn't Megan Galagher in the flesh." Holding out a large hand he continued. "Wait til I tell the missus that I shook the hand of the woman behind 'Samantha Steele, Private Investigator'. Some mighty fine reading, if I do say so myself."</p>
		<p>Megan smiled and took the proffered hand in a warm handshake. "Thank you. I'm glad you like her. Sam is pretty easy to write for. She has a penchant for attracting murder, mystery, and mayhem, but she thrives on it."</p>
		<p>"Heh, she also thrives on handing the bad guys their butts in a sling," Toby chuckled. "Black hair, gray eyes, six feet of muscle and attitude.... That's
			<b>my</b> kind of woman," the storekeeper mock growled. The petite blond shook her head and laughed.
		</p>
		<p>"So what brings you to Cutters Gap?" The big man inquired as he handed the writer her sandwich and soda. "No offense, but it wasn't by choice," the blonde offered as she picked up the sandwich and took a bite, rolling her eyes and humming in delight at the heavenly taste. Causing the big man to grin proudly. "The attendant at the last gas station I stopped at, told me that if I kept straight on Highway 41, it would lead me directly to the Interstate in about twenty miles. That was thirty miles ago." The writer finished dejectedly.</p>
		<p>The older man blew out his cheeks and scowled. "That last gas station you stopped at was in Knox City, right?" Megan nodded and he continued. "And, about ten miles out, Highway 41 split, right?" Another nod. "I don't suppose he told you that you would have had to branch off to the left, did he?" Megan sighed. "No, he sure didn't." The big man patted her hand reassuringly. "Well don't you worry young lady. You're not too far from the Interstate; you finish eating and old Toby will tell you exactly how to get there." Looking out the plate-glass window at the falling snow he added.</p>
		<p>"You should be well on your way before the snow starts to stick." Reassured, the young woman dug back into her sandwich with gusto and the two talked some more about the daring detective.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Randi stomped her boot-clad feet to dislodge the snow that stuck to them. She had just finished filling the twin five-gallon cans that she had strapped to the back of her Jeep Cherokee, from the kerosene tank behind Toby's store. The snow had begun to fall harder and was accumulating quickly on the ground. The tall woman wanted to finish her supply run and get back up the hill before the driving became hazardous.</p>
		<p>She opened the door and walked into the cheery warmth. Looking around, she spotted the big man talking to a petite strawberry blond. Toby noticed the statuesque brunette immediately, a huge grin creasing his face. "Randi," he bellowed. Excusing himself from the young woman, he exited from behind the counter, walked up to the tall woman, and wrapped her up in a big bear hug. "It's good to see you, girl. I was wondering if I'd see you before old man winter had his way with us." Randi returned the hug, allowing herself this small comfort from an old friend. Stepping back when he released her, she shrugged, "I figured I'd better grab some extra kerosene and food for my furry freeloaders." Almost as an afterthought, she added, "I also wanted to see if you'd gotten in any new books. I've got a feeling I'm going to need something to keep me from going stir crazy."</p>
		<p>"Funny you should mention that," the storeowner replied with a twinkle in his eye. "We got a good shipment in last week, and this week we've even got one of the book writers." At Randi's quizzical look he chuckled, "C'mon, let me introduce you to someone." Slipping a big hand under her elbow, he led her over to the seated woman.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Megan turned in her seat to get a better look at the woman who'd just entered the store and who'd been quickly engulfed in the big man's arms; she nearly gasped aloud when the woman stood back. The vision before her was six foot tall, if she was an inch, with silken raven-colored hair that flowed gracefully across broad shoulders. Her black bomber jacket couldn't disguise her well-endowed chest and trim waist. Muscular Jean-clad legs seemed to go on forever before stopping at her charcoal-hiking boots. Dragging her eyes back up, Megan was captured by the crystal blue eyes, set off by thick dark lashes and high cheekbones.
			<i>Good lord! Except for the blue eyes, that could be Samantha Steele come to life. </i> Megan broke out of her reverie and stood as the pair approached her.
		</p>
		<p>"Dr. Randi Oakes, allow me to introduce you to Ms. Megan Gallagher." The man-mountain grinned as the two women clasped hands. "The lovely Ms. Gallagher is the brains behind..."</p>
		<p>"Samantha Steele," the tall woman finished, quirking a grin and releasing the smaller hand. "It's a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Gallagher. Samantha Steele is quite the popular detective." Randi was polite, but Toby sensed coolness in the quiet but normally friendly woman.</p>
		<p>"It's nice to meet you, Dr. Oakes," Megan smiled. "And thank you. It's always nice to meet another Samantha Steele fan."</p>
		<p>"I said she was quite the popular detective, Ms. Gallagher; I didn't say I was a fan," Randi returned demurely. Noting the looks of puzzlement on the faces in front of her, Randi explained. "There's a little too much bias in your stories for my tastes."</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry, Dr. Oakes, I don't quite follow you." Megan was puzzled and more than a little flustered at the accusation. </p>
		<p>Randi took in the faces of the two people in front of her, noting the confusion on one, and concern on the other.
			<i>I'm not in the mood for this. I came in here for supplies, not a debate.</i> "Look...never mind. Let's just say Samantha Steele isn't my cup of tea and leave it at that." With that, the tall woman started to turn away. She was stopped by a light touch on her arm.
		</p>
		<p>"Please, Dr. Oakes," the small blonde pleaded. "I'd really like to know what you are talking about. I try really hard not to offend any ethnic or religious groups."</p>
		<p>Randi sighed and turned, looking first at her friend, who stood with his arms folded across his massive chest and his bushy eyebrows furrowed in consternation, and then at the troubled expression on the small woman in front of her. "Ms. Gallagher, I've read quite a few of your stories. And, while they are gripping mysteries, they all have one recurring and disturbing trend. They all feature gay and lesbian characters. And those characters are always portrayed as being sick, twisted and immoral. That is a malicious, incorrect, and inflammatory stereotype, Ms. Gallagher, and I find it offensive."</p>
		<p>Megan's confusion turned to cold indifference as she stepped back from the taller woman. "I call them as I see them, Dr. Oakes. Those kind of people are an affront to society, and serve absolutely no purpose in this world. I'm sorry if my portrayals of these individuals offend you."</p>
		<p>Toby was stunned at the sheer venom of the younger woman's words. He stepped back as Randi stepped closer to the strawberry blond. Her narrowed eyes were chips of ice. "These 'people,' as you refer to them, are just that;
			<b>people.</b> No different from you, or your readers, except in whom they choose to love. They are your doctors, your lawyers, your friends, and your family. They have a hard enough time dealing with a society that won't accept them, and laws that don't protect them. They don't need to be the poster children for your small-minded prejudice."
		</p>
		<p>"Well my 'small-minded prejudice' doesn't seem to bother the public-at-large, Dr. Oakes," the writer replied with smug venom. "As my book sales will attest to. If the faggots have a problem with it, they don't have to read it."</p>
		<p>"Well, Ms.Gallagher, the 'public-at-large' also gobbles up the tabloids that feature women giving birth to three-headed babies," the tall woman smirked and shrugged. "Go figure."
			<i>Gotcha!</i> the tall woman thought smugly, as she saw the flush of anger creep up the smaller woman's neck. "And trust me, the 'faggots'
			<b>don't </b>read your books...
			<b>we</b> would rather read a grocery list."
		</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Megan stared blankly for a moment before the words sank in. Green eyes sparked and full, pink lips grimaced in distaste. "A goddamned dyke," she growled. "I should have known." She spun on her heel and, grabbing her dayplanner from the counter, she addressed the storekeeper. "I appreciate your hospitality, Toby, but I think I'd better leave. The less time I spend around her," casting a glare at the stone-faced physician, "the cleaner I'll feel."</p>
		<p>Toby didn't want it to end like this. He began to protest. "Aw, Ms. Megan, please..."</p>
		<p>Megan cut him off, a plea in those fiery, green eyes. "Please Toby, just let me pay for my food, and tell me how to get to the highway."</p>
		<p>The big man sighed and shook his head. "There's no charge for the food." He waved off her attempted protest. "No charge! Now, to get to the highway, just take a right when you leave here, and follow the road for about three miles. You'll see a..."</p>
		<p>"The snow's getting too deep." Randi cut him off. She was staring out the window at the hard-falling snow. "If that's her car out there, it's not going to make it. She'd be better off waiting it out."</p>
		<p>"The Hell I will!" the little blond snarled. "I'd rather end up face-down in a snow drift than spend another moment here with you." With that, she stormed out the door and ran to her car.</p>
		<p>The doctor and the storekeeper stood and watched as the Lexus sped, slipping and sliding, onto the main highway. Gray eyes turned to blue and held for a moment before the tall woman shrugged. "She'll be back," Randi offered with more confidence than she felt.</p>
		<p>"I hope so," the older man mumbled with some concern. He studied the floor for a moment before meeting her eyes again. "A little hard on her...weren't you?" He commented, not unkindly. </p>
		<p>"Not as hard as she is, on people she doesn't even know," Randi shot back sharply. Instantly regretting her attitude with the older man, Randi ran her fingers through her hair and sighed. "Toby, what she's doing is wrong. There are people out there who think the way to improve society is to paint the pavement with some queer's blood; and the picture she paints of gay people only lends credence to that theory."</p>
		<p>The big man pondered her words. "I never thought about that," the older man offered. "Truth to tell, I never picked up on the 'evil-gay-character' trend either." He grinned apologetically. "I guess I was just too caught up in the action."</p>
		<p>The tall woman shook her head and smiled. "She does write a gripping story, I'll give her that."</p>
		<p>The subject of the writer having been dropped, both were at a loss as to what to say next. Finally, the older man broke the silence. "When are you going to come to dinner again?" he inquired gently. "Kate really misses her culinary test subject, says she's tired of hearing 'not enough pepper' from me," he teased hopefully. </p>
		<p>Randi bowed her head and sighed.
			<i>I knew this was coming. </i> "I don't know, Toby," she mumbled. "I'm just not ready to face people right now."
		</p>
		<p>"Kate and I are not just 'people,' Randi...we're your friends. We have been ever since you first came to Cutters Gap," the older man rebutted, mildly scolding. He placed a caring hand on her shoulder. "And when
			<b>will </b>you be ready, Randi? It's been damn near a year! I can almost...
			<b>almost </b>understand your leaving the hospital because of the memories. But, honey, I cannot, for the life of me, understand your walking away from a brilliant career and cutting yourself off from everyone that cares about you." Tucking a thick finger under her chin, he nudged her head up until his eyes caught hers. "It wasn't your fault, child."
		</p>
		<p>Randi felt the familiar ache wrap itself around her chest and begin to squeeze. Her eyes and throat began to burn, and she knew that if she didn't get away soon she would fall apart...again. Gathering up her dwindling self-control, she patted his hand and smiled crookedly. "I'm getting there, Toby," She lied. "I just need a little more time to get through this. Can you give me that?"</p>
		<p>The storekeeper knew she wasn't being completely honest with him, but knowing how skittish she was right now, he didn't want to push. "Okay," he smiled reassuringly. "I can do that." </p>
		<p>Randi let go of the breath she didn't know she was holding. "Great! Well, I guess I'd better finish up and get out of here before Ms. Poison Pen comes back," she mock-shuddered, then headed toward the books.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>
			<i>I can't fucking believe it!</i> Megan seethed, as she sped down the snow-laden road.
			<i>She has the nerve to be offended by my writing when her whole lifestyle is an offense. Huh, wait 'til she sees my next story; I'll really give her something to be offended about. </i>The small blond grinned evilly at the thought. She frowned again as another; more troubling thought came to mind.
			<i>I can't believe how much she resembles Samantha Steele; ugh!</i> "Well, Sam," she mused aloud, "you're about to get a thorough makeover, girlfriend."
		</p>
		<p>Megan slowed the car as she came to the fork that separated Randi's road from the highway. "Damnittohell!" the writer cursed aloud, "Toby didn't mention this in his directions."
			<i>He hadn't finished giving directions before 'Dr. Dyke' butted in; </i>a little voice reminded her. "She should have minded her own damned business," Megan grumbled. She studied the road, searching for some kind of sign that would tell her which way to go. Finding none, she resigned herself to turning around and going back for more directions. She paused when she noticed faint tire tracks in the road to her right. "Well,
			<b>somebody </b>went this way," the author concluded, not knowing that they were the tracks Randi had made on her way into town. Satisfied with her decision, the writer stepped on the gas.
		</p>
		<p>Megan negotiated the curvy road with growing unease. The snow was getting deeper; making it harder to maintain control, and the writer was beginning to worry. "This isn't working. I'm going to have to turn around," the writer mused aloud. "God, I just hope
			<b>she </b>isn't there."
		</p>
		<p>She was so intent on finding someplace to turn around; the writer didn't see the small, speckled fawn emerging from the trees until she was almost upon her. With a shrieking curse, the blonde hit the brakes and swerved to the right as the frightened animal bolted to the left. Desperately trying to regain control, the writer spun the steering wheel back to the left, bringing the front end back to the road, but losing the rear end as it fishtailed off the shoulder. The rear wheel buckled on impact with a low lying tree stump, and the laws of momentum flexed their muscles as the Lexus somersaulted three times through the snow-covered brush before coming to rest, wheels down, against an unforgiving maple.</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Five">
		<p>Randi grunted as she pitched the fifty-pound bag of dog food into the rear of the Jeep, then made a show of dusting off her hands. "Piece 'o' cake," she grinned crookedly at the big man who eyed her with stern disapproval.</p>
		<p>"Look, 'Ms. Tuff-Stuff'," he wagged a finger at her. "We both know you're young, healthy-as-a-horse, and you lift weights, but it wouldn't have hurt you to let me load that for you," he mock-scolded.</p>
		<p>Randi looked down contritely, scuffing the snow with the toe of her boot. "I know, uncle," she mumbled, using the more familiar name she always called the older man. "But I've got to show off these awesome muscles to somebody," she grinned rakishly, while curling her arm in a 'muscle' pose.</p>
		<p>"Lord, save me from cocky little girls," he chuckled, as he placed the rest of her purchases in the back.</p>
		<p>The tall woman was closing the car door when a sudden thought hit her, and she turned to the storekeeper. "Toby, do you happen to have a spare piece of plywood lying around? It doesn't have to be real big, maybe a couple of feet long, and about a foot wide. One of the windows in the shed is broken, and I need to board it up until I can get the glass replaced."</p>
		<p>The storekeeper pursed his lips and pondered for a moment before smiling. "I've got just the thing," he declared, and headed back into the store. "Be right back." </p>
		<p>Within moments he came back, carrying a length of cream-colored board. "Will this do? It was left over from the fence I put up around Kate's vegetable garden."</p>
		<p>"This will do fine," Randi replied as she placed the board on the car seat, and closed the door. Walking arm-in-arm to the drivers' door, they stood for a moment, in awkward silence as the falling snow dotted their hair and clothing.</p>
		<p>"Well," Randi broke the silence. "I'd better get going. Tell Kate I'll see her soon" At the older man's cocked eyebrow, she added, "I promise!"</p>
		<p>"See that you do," the big man rumbled sternly. "I promised your Uncle Jake that I'd look after you…. Don't make me a liar."</p>
		<p>A bittersweet smile graced the tall woman's face at the mention of her uncles' name. "I won't, Uncle Toby," she reassured, as she settled in the vehicle.</p>
		<p>The storekeeper stood and watched as the taillights of the Jeep faded into the white curtain. His mind wandered back to the day he first laid eyes on her. </p>
		<p>Toby was on his knees re-stocking a shelf, when the ting-a-ling of the doorbell announced a visitor. The big man turned and saw his long-time friend, Jake Oakes holding open the door and encouraging an, as yet unseen, individual to enter. "Come on, Randi. There's someone I want you to meet." And then, she walked in. She was tall, even at the age of twelve, and so gangly, but even then, she was a beauty; and nearly the spitting image of the man next to her. Jake gently took her hand, and together they approached the storekeeper. </p>
		<p>"Toby Jenkins, I'd like you to meet Randi Christine Oakes…my niece." The elder Oakes announced.</p>
		<p>Toby held out his hand to the girl, who stood there in shy silence studying the floor. "A pleasure to meet you, young lady."</p>
		<p>She lifted her face to him, and Toby's heart lurched. Her silky, raven hair hung limply about her face. Her cheeks, which should have held the pink blush of youth, were pale and drawn, and lightly tracked with dried tears. And her eyes…lord; her eyes…such a beautiful, crystal-blue; and filled with so much sadness. She looked up at him, and Toby could tell she was somewhat intimidated by his size, but she gamely placed her hand in his big one. "Pleased to meet you, sir," she semi-whispered. From that moment on, the big man was hers.</p>
		<p>Toby would later learn that Randi's parents, Jake's brother and sister-in-law, were killed in an auto accident. Randi's mother had no living relatives and the authorities had misplaced Jake's address information. So a grieving Randi spent weeks being shuffled between courts and foster homes, lost and alone, until Jake's' address had been found. Jake and Randi barely knew each other, as Randi was a toddler the last time he saw her, but their mutual grief became the foundation for a bond that even most fathers and daughters never shared.</p>
		<p>Randi flourished under Jake's' care. Her outgoing personality and gentle, caring spirit made her the darling of Cutters Gap, and the center of Toby and Kate Jenkins' world.</p>
		<p>Now the center of their world was lost and alone again…for entirely different reasons. Only this time, there was no one that would come and rescue her. Jake had passed on years ago, from a massive heart attack, while the young woman was in her final year of medical school. Back then, she had a town full of friends and adopted family to see her through her heartache. Now, with this latest tragedy that befell her last year…well, the town was still here…but, in her grief and self perceived guilt, Randi had cut herself off from everyone that would help her through it. Toby knew in his heart, that if the gentle-hearted woman didn't end her self imposed exile soon, she would never come out of the well of despair she had fallen into.</p>
		<p>"We'll be here for you honey," he whispered to the falling snow. "Don't wait too long."</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Randi breathed a huge sigh of relief as she traveled the snow-packed highway.
			<i>That wasn't so bad, </i>she half smiled to herself.
			<i>Thank you, Uncle Toby, for not pushing. I just need time. </i>Satisfied with her self-deception, the dark-haired Doctor's thoughts turned to a certain strawberry-blonde writer.
			<i>God, what a pill! The tall woman grimaced. Still…she had some lovely green eyes. Hell, she had a lovely
				<b>everything</b>. It's a pity. I'll bet when she's not being hateful, she's pretty darn nice to be around.
			</i> "Heh," Randi snorted. "Not that you'll ever get the chance to find out."
		</p>
		<p>The tall woman turned onto the road that led to her house and turned on the radio, hoping to hear the latest on the storm that was assaulting the area. Trisha Yearwood was belting out 'Ribbons and Bows.'
			<i>Ooohh, I love this song. </i> Randi leaned back and let her rich contralto voice accompany the country diva. Her voice trailed off, as she noticed bright beams of light branching across the road up ahead.
			<i>What the hell…?</i>
		</p>
		<p>Randi wasn't sure what to expect, and slowed her approach accordingly, craning her neck and following the path of the lights back to their source. "Son of a bitch!" The tall woman exclaimed as her eyes fell upon the broken and dented mass of metal that used to be Megan's Lexus. Pulling her Jeep to the side of the road, Randi reached down and turned on the CB radio that hung below the dashboard. "Breaker, breaker…Cutters Gap Rescue, this is Randi Oakes. Come in please." She barked into the handmike. Hearing no immediate response, she tried again. "Breaker…Cutters Gap Rescue, please respond." Getting no response, the Doctor growled and threw open her door. She had one foot on the snowy ground when the radio crackled. </p>
		<p>
			<b>"Cutters Gap Rescue, responding. What's the problem Randi?" </b> Chet Masters' voice sounded a little harried.
		</p>
		<p>Randi grabbed up the Mic. "We've got a vehicle crash, Chet. About a mile and a half up my road. The driver's still in the car, and I'm on my way down to assist…but she's going to need transport ASAP." Getting no response, Randi tapped the button. "I need transport Chet, do you copy?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"No can do, Randi,"</b> the medic sighed.
			<b> I'm down here at old man Cuthbert's place. He and his car got real familiar with a tree. He doesn't look to be too bad, but we're having a bitch of a time prying him out of this hunk of scrap he calls a car. And this damn snow ain't making it any easier. Any way you can get the patient up to your place?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Shit, shit, shit! </i> "That's an affirmative, Chet…I'll find a way," she gritted as she dropped the Mic and climbed out of the cab.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Sorry, Randi. Keep me informed."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Yeah, right," the tall woman grumbled as she threw open the back door and reached for the snow broom and the 'First Response' First Aid Kit that her uncle always kept in the Jeep.</p>
		<p>Stumbling and sliding through the snowy brush, Randi made her way to the stout, aged Maple that cradled the silver Lexus in it's bosom. Impact with the tree had loosed the snow that clung to the branches above, effectively covering the vehicle in a pristine blanket.
			<i>Shit, if it hadn't been for the headlights, I would've never known it was here. </i>Setting the First Aid kit on a nearby stump, the tall woman quickly brushed the snow away from the door and part of the roof. Time was of the essence now, and she didn't need packed or falling snow to impede her efforts. Having cleared the door, she reached for the door handle and pulled…only to have the door open about an inch before locking in place. Randi cursed and pulled again…without success. The door was stuck. Grabbing the brush, she pushed more snow away from the bottom of the door, working her way back toward the front of the vehicle, and groaned in frustration when she saw the crumpled metal where the door meets the side panel. "Goddammit," she growled. "I don't need this right now."
		</p>
		<p>Dropping the brush, Randi straightened to full height and took a deep breath. "Getting mad isn't going to help," she reminded herself. "Just get the damned door open." With that, she planted one foot in the snow, one foot on the car body, and both hands on the doorframe, counted to three…and pulled. Sinewy muscles strained and pulled, as flesh battled metal; and with a long, dull groan, metal yielded. Pushing the door back as far as it would go, the Doctor peered into the dimly lit interior, and groaned.</p>
		<p>The blood-matted blonde head rested on the expended air bag that covered the steering wheel. Her limp body held in place by the shoulder harness. A blood caked arm hung limply between unnaturally twisted legs.
			<i> Jesus, </i> The first thing the tall woman did was recline the drivers' seat back a few inches, to give herself a little more room. Then, reaching in, Randi gently grasped Megan's head in her hands. "Megan, this is Dr. Oakes…can you hear me?" Receiving no response, Randi continued speaking aloud. "Still not talking to me, huh? That's okay. I need to check your breathing." Unwilling to remove her hands from their supporting positions; the doctor leaned in further, until her cheek was within an inch of the unconscious woman's lips. Almost immediately, she felt the warm breaths against her skin. "Well, you're breathing okay. Now I have to move you away from this wheel, so I can see how badly you're injured." Keeping the blonde head as straight as possible, Randi lifted her away from the steering wheel, and lay her back on the seat. Next, Randi needed to stabilize the neck. And as much as she hated to do it, she would have to release her hold and step away. "Okay Megan, I need to move away for a moment. I'll be right back." Releasing her hold and backing out of the car, Randi lunged for the First Aid kit.
			<i>Please god, let there be a collar in here. I can't remember the last time I've looked in here. </i> Placing the suitcase-type kit on the ground, she unsnapped the latches and laid it open, doing a quick visual inventory.
			<i>Thank you! </i> Grabbing up the stiff, molded collar, she reached back in the vehicle and carefully fastened it around the writer's neck.
		</p>
		<p>With the most critical task completed, the raven-haired doctor began a swift inventory of the small woman's injuries. The physician worked quickly and efficiently, verbalizing her actions, in the off chance that the unresponsive woman could hear and feel what was happening. "Your pulse is pretty fast, Megan, but that's 'cause you've lost some blood. You're breathing kind of fast too, but that's to be expected. I'm going to open your eye and shine a light in there for just a moment, okay?" Shining the penlight in the young woman's eyes, the dark haired woman noted a sluggish reaction from the pupils. "Hmmm, looks like you may have a concussion too. Don't worry, we'll take care of it."</p>
		<p>The one-way conversation continued as the tall doctor pressed, probed, and examined as much of the limp body as she could reach; applying temporary dressings and bandages as she went along.</p>
		<p>A long twenty minutes had passed before Randi was finished with examination and treatment. She stood outside the damaged vehicle, pondering her next course of action. The snow was getting deeper and Megan's chances of becoming hypothermic increased with every passing moment, in spite of the rescue blanket that Randi had covered her with.
			<i>Now what," </i>her mind screamed.
			<i>No backboard, no stretcher,
				<b>nothing</b> to immobilize her with, so I can get her up to the house…DAMMIT!
			</i> Running a frustrated hand through her hair, the desperate doctor searched her mind for an answer. Looking up at her Jeep, and down at her patient, Randi decided on a course of action. It was risky, at best, but it was the only chance the younger woman would have.
		</p>
		<p>Scrambling up to the Jeep, Randi grabbed the piece of board that Toby had given her earlier, and carried it back to the Lexus. She then grabbed the remaining roll bandage and elastic bandage; sliding the board down and behind Megan's head, Randi used the remaining bandaging to secure the blonde's head and upper torso to the board.</p>
		<p>Randi sighed as she looked down at the tightly wrapped writer lying in the car. This solution was about as far from perfect as she could get; and risky as hell for the patient, but it was the best she could come up with. Now she would have to get the injured woman out of her car, and into the Jeep that waited for her at the top of the incline, about twenty yards away.
			<i> Thank god, this didn't happen further up the hill, where the woods
				<b>really</b> drop down from the road.
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>"All right, Ms. Megan, I have to get you up to my truck. And in order to do that, I'm going to have to move you out of the car, and on to the ground for a moment. Now I'm going to have the thermal blanket under you, but you'll still feel a few moments of cold; but it'll be over quick, so don't worry." The tall woman bent to her task, but paused, as she remembered something. With a muttered curse, she ran back to the Jeep, whipped open the passenger door, and laid the seat back to a nearly prone position.
			<i>That'll make things a little easier when we get up here. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Back at the wreck, Randi placed the blanket beside the car and began the arduous process of removing the unconscious woman from the vehicle, and repositioning her for easier pickup. Having done this, the dark haired physician squatted down, and carefully gathered the smaller woman in her arms.
			<i>God, she's so light. </i> Shaking off the thought, the tall woman made her way up to the Jeep with her helpless burden.
		</p>
		<p>It was slow, awkward, and more than a little frustrating, but Randi finally had the writer tucked into the passenger seat of the Jeep. The motor was running, the heater was on, the patient was firmly strapped in. The only thing left for the weary physician to do was gather up the remains of the First Aid kit.</p>
		<p>Short moment's later; fingers nearly numb from the cold, shifted the Jeep into drive and headed home.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Six">
		<p>Randi pulled up and positioned the Jeep parallel to the front steps of the sprawling ranch house that she called home. Throwing the vehicle in park and setting the emergency brake, Randi turned and addressed her unconscious passenger. "All right, Megan…we're at my house. I've got to run up and open some doors, so I can carry you in. I'll be right back." Leaving the motor and heater running, the tall woman bounded up the snow-packed steps. Propping open the door to the screened-in porch, she stepped quickly into the house, side-stepping the happy canines that came to greet her. "Not now, ladies…we've got company, and I've got to get her in here and settled ASAP." As if understanding, the furry pair wandered out to the porch and sat down, silently observing the large, humming creature that sat in front.</p>
		<p>Randi's mind was racing as she traveled down the long hallway, toward the back half of the house, pausing in front of the powder-blue door that she hadn't opened in months. Sighing, Randi opened the door and turned on the light, battling the waves of melancholy that washed over her as she stood in the small treatment room and office of Dr. Jacob Oakes. Even though he was retired from practice, the elder Oakes insisted on keeping a well-stocked office in case his farming neighbors needed assistance. The nearest medical facility was in Knox, a full thirty miles away; much too far away for some injuries that came with using heavy farming equipment. Over the years there had been more than a few ranchers, farmers, and pregnant mothers that were thankful for the old man's foresight. Just as Randi was thankful for it now, as she jogged out to the Jeep.</p>
		<p>Within moments, the raven-haired doctor had the petite writer lying on the examining table. "Okay, Megan, the first thing I have to do is take care of that nasty head wound of yours." The tall woman continued her one-sided conversation with the patient, no longer sure if it was for Megan's benefit, or her own. "This is going to need some stitches. I'm pretty sure you're not feeling
			<b>anything</b> right now, but, just in case, I'm going to administer a local anesthetic." Moving to the locked cabinet, she pulled out a disposable syringe, a bottle of Lignocaine, 1%, and a pack of Ethilon suture. Snagging the rolling stool with her foot, she settled beside the blonde head and began her work.
		</p>
		<p>Randi stood and stretched, groaning as stiff and aching muscles protested the action. A full two hours had passed while she reset bones, splinted limbs, stitched and bandaged wounds, and performed a more thorough examination of the unconscious woman. Her vital signs were greatly improved, and another check of the pupils showed them to be slightly more reactive, much to the tall woman's relief. An injection of antibiotics finished the treatment.</p>
		<p>"Well now, I guess the only thing left to do is to get you into a bed and sit and wait for you to wake up. I'm going to throw some sheets on the bed in the spare room. Be right back."</p>
		<p>Randi hastened to the spare bedroom, grabbing sheets and a blanket from the linen closet on the way. As she began to make the bed, a sudden thought made her pause.
			<i>Better to be safe than sorry, </i>she decided, as she went back to the linen closet and pulled down a plastic fitted sheet. Upon completion of the bed, the brunette returned to her patient.
		</p>
		<p>"All right then, Ms. Megan, let's get you settled into a real bed." The doctor gently lifted the strawberry blonde into her arms, being mindful of the splinted limbs, and carried her to the other room. Once she had the smaller woman settled, the dark-haired doctor decided she would have some time to tend to her own needs before her patient regained consciousness.</p>
		<p>As she turned to leave the room, Randi noticed, with no small amusement, two furry heads peeking around the edge of the doorframe. "Well, aren't we the nosy ones," she chided. </p>
		<p>The little golden one had the grace to duck her head, as if in embarrassment, while her larger midnight companion merely cocked a triangular head; a gesture that was clearly doggie language for 'and your point is…?'</p>
		<p>Randi chuckled at the furry pair as she moved past them and down the hall. "Keep an eye on her," the doctor called back. "Let me know if she starts to wake up." The two canines looked at each other, then to the unmoving human in the bed. With a mutual sigh, they curled up in the doorway, facing the bed.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Randi finally felt human again. A quick, hot shower and warm, dry clothes had done wonders for her aching body. Now, she sat in her kitchen, munching on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and listening to the latest weather reports. Not much had changed from the first report she had heard this morning. The falling snow would vary in intensity, but would still continue until at least Thursday evening. The exhausted woman sighed and hung her head.
			<i>Great! It'll be a month before they can clear the road leading up here. And I get to spend that whole month with the delightful Ms. Galagher. Maybe I should just shoot myself now and get it over with. </i> "Oh, well," she muttered aloud, "at least it won't be boring." Picking up the phone, she dialed a familiar number. "I'd better let Toby know what's going on up here, in case someone comes looking for her."
		</p>
		<p>A short while later, armed with a paperback book, a thermos of coffee, and a comforter, the tall woman padded back to the room where her patient lay. She would be keeping a vigil over the injured woman until she awakened. The woman stopped short as she approached the doorway and chuckled as she looked down at her appointed 'watchers.' The big black canine was sprawled on her back, snoring contentedly. Her golden companion lay horizontally, with her head resting comfortably across the black's neck. "Damned if you two aren't named right," the woman grinned as she stepped over the cozy pair.</p>
		<p>Laying her things at the end of the bed, the tall woman went back into the office to fetch several items that she would need close-by over the next few days. Returning to the bedside, she placed them neatly on the nightstand next to the bed, then proceeded to do a quick check of the blonde's pulse, respiration, blood pressure and pupils. Finding them all satisfactory, she gathered up her things and ambled over to the big, overstuffed armchair that was located by the window. Randi sighed as she curled her tall frame into the inviting softness. She had always loved this old chair. Growing up, it was her fortress, her cocoon…a warm, quiet place where a teenage girl could sit and dream and ponder the mysteries of life as she gazed at the stars through her window.
			<i>Nothing's changed Uncle Jake…I'm still pondering. Only now, it's not so much the mysteries of life, as the unfairness of it. She shouldn't have died, Uncle Jake…I should have been there…but I wasn't…and she died! I'm sorry, Uncle Jake. </i> Her throat burned with the sob that she was trying to suppress, as a lone teardrop escaped her tightly closed eyes.
			<i>I'm so sorry, Casey. </i>
		</p>
		<p>The heartsick woman was startled from her grief as a small, leathery pad touched her hand. Watery, blue eyes flew open and were captured by soft brown orbs that gazed up at her with almost human compassion. Then the small golden creature that more closely resembled a fox than a dog, gingerly crawled up into her lap; a soft, little tongue snaked out, snatching away the errant tear, before the petite head lay gently upon her shoulder. "Thank you, baby," the tall woman sighed, as she buried her face in the sweet-smelling fur. This scene was not new. It had been played out many times over the last several months. Her silent companions always seemed to know when the guilt and pain would overcome her…and they would be there. The little one would offer her best canine imitation of a heartfelt hug; and the beautiful black would sit beside them, silent and unmoving, as if offering comfort by the mere strength of her presence. </p>
		<p>And she sat there now, once again, offering support in the best way she knew how. She would remain here, a silent sentinel, keeping watch as Morpheus lured her two companions into his realm.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>She was tumbling, falling. Flashes of white and green and brown filling her vision like an insane kaleidoscope. And then, mercifully, oblivion. Now the world outside was pulling her from her cozy darkness…and she really didn't want to go…it hurt too much. "Oh, God," she croaked in a voice she barely recognized as her own. She wanted to move…. she really did, but even a little stretch of stiff limbs had hurt. "Owww," she said through clenched teeth, as tears leaked out of tightly closed eyes.</p>
		<p>"Easy," the silky, deep voice cajoled her, as a cool hand brushed wisps of hair from her eyes.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Who…? Why does that voice sound familiar? </i> Unwilling eyelids fluttered, finally giving way, as bleary green orbs brought into focus the face behind the voice.
		</p>
		<p>"You!"</p>
		<p>"Afraid so."</p>
		<p>"Aw, shit!"</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Seven">
		<p>The tall woman cocked a bemused eyebrow. "Well….that's not the normal response for saving someone's life, but…You're welcome."</p>
		<p>Megan's scathing response was reduced to a raspy squawk. The small blonde grimaced as she licked parched lips and tried to swallow the pound of sand that seemed to be sitting in her mouth. She flinched as she felt something touch her lips.</p>
		<p>"Here, sip this….slowly," the tall woman cautioned, as she held the straw to the blonde's lips.</p>
		<p>The writer glared as she wrapped her lips around the slender tube, bristling at the perceived 'command' given by this…. Person, and proceeded to take several long, deep gulps of the wonderfully cool water.</p>
		<p>"Hey," the doctor exclaimed, as she pulled the straw away from greedy lips.</p>
		<p>Any protest the writer may have had to having her liquid treat removed, expired quickly. Her eyes bulged, as her stomach clenched painfully, and the liquid contents inside made a searing, painful journey back up her esophagus.</p>
		<p>Randi knew what was coming, and without missing a beat, she placed the water cup on the nightstand and picked up the small kidney-shaped bowl that she had placed there last night, and had it in place as the small woman lurched to the side and surrendered the contents of her stomach.</p>
		<p>Randi held the limp, sweaty strands of hair out of the young woman's face as she spasmed through the remaining dry heaves of her rebelling stomach. Finally, the writer flopped back in the bed with an exhausted groan.</p>
		<p>The tall woman simply couldn't help it. "Feel better now?" she inquired innocently.</p>
		<p>The writer glared, then squeezed her eyes shut as a wave of pain washed through her. "Wonderful, thank you," she responded through clenched teeth.</p>
		<p>
			<i>You're being a jerk; Randi's conscience scolded her. You're
				<b>supposed</b> to be a doctor! This woman is confused, exhausted, and in pain. You should be helping her…
				<b>not baiting her! </b>
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>With her self-lecture finished, the guilt-ridden brunette used a kinder tone to address her patient.</p>
		<p>"Ms. Galagher, I know you're extremely dry, thirsty, and maybe a little hungry. But, because of your concussion, and the trauma to your abdomen from the car seatbelt, your stomach is not able to handle whole lot. That's why I told you to sip the water slowly."</p>
		<p>Green eyes looked up at the tall woman warily.
			<i>You may not want to admit it, Meg…but she's right. </i> "Yes, of course, you're right," she mumbled. Taking a semi-deep breath, the blonde reined in her hostility for the moment. "Look, Dr. Oakes, I appreciate the fact that you saved my life and treated my injuries. But let's face it…you don't like me, and I don't like you. The sooner we part company, the better off we'll both be. If you will allow me to use your phone to call my agent, I can have her send an ambulance for me and take me back to New York. Once I'm settled, I'll make sure you are suitably reimbursed for your time and trouble."
		</p>
		<p>The tall woman grimaced internally.
			<i>She is gonna shit a brick. </i> Clearing her throat, the brunette walked around the bed, heading toward the window. "Well, Ms.Galagher, I'll be happy to let you use the phone to call your agent. I'm sure she'll be glad to know that you're okay." Grasping the cord to the window blinds, the brunette pulled, slowly raising the pale lavender shield. "But I'm afraid an ambulance is out of the question right now."
		</p>
		<p>The small blonde's eyes grew saucer-wide as she beheld the solid white world outside the window.</p>
		<p>"There's already more than two feet of snow out there," the doctor continued as she lowered the blinds. "Snowfall is expected to continue for at least another twenty four hours. With that amount of snowfall, it'll be six…perhaps seven weeks before the road leading up here will be clear. We're snowbound, Ms. Galagher, I'm sorry."</p>
		<p>Megan sat there, stunned. The impact of the tall woman's words sinking in.
			<i>I'll be at the mercy of this…this
				<b>pervert</b> for months!
			</i> Pain, anxiety, and unreasoning fear worked together to shatter what little grasp she had on civility. "You bitch," she rasped to the startled doctor. "You couldn't bring me into town for treatment…couldn't call an ambulance when you found me." Using her good hand, the agitated blonde threw back the bed covers and struggled to rise. Only to have a firm hand on her shoulder, impeding her efforts. "Let me go," she spat, still trying to rise, her green eyes sparking and her temper flaring. "I don't know what you hope to gain by imprisoning me here with you, but it won't work. I'll get away sooner or later…and I'll make you sorry you ever met me. I'll…"
		</p>
		<p>"ENOUGH!" The tall woman bellowed, as a firm shove set the blonde firmly on her back and kept her there. Randi had had enough. Her own temper was beginning to flare; and that was something a responsible Doctor should never let happen. She had to end this quickly. Steely blue eyes locked on to hostile green. "First of all," she began, through gritted teeth, "I'm
			<b>already</b> sorry that I met you. Second, I
			<b>tried</b> to get our rescue squad to come for you. But they were tied up on another accident site. Third, the nearest medical facility that could handle your extensive injuries is over thirty miles away. Road conditions being the way they are, we never would have made it. Fourth, I don't 'hope-to-gain'
			<b>anything</b> by keeping you here. If anything, I expect to lose quite a bit…my sanity, most of all. Now you don't have to like me…you don't have to like being stuck here with me. But you
			<b>do</b> have to quit fighting me, and allow me to help you heal. If you don't, then by god, I'll keep you so sedated you won't know your ass from your elbow the whole time you're here." Taking a deep breath, and removing her restraining hand from the younger woman's shoulder, she replaced the cover over the unresisting body. In a slightly gentler tone, she inquired, "which way is it going to be, Ms. Galagher?"
		</p>
		<p>Frustrated tears escaped tightly closed eyelids. "You win, Dr. Oakes," the blonde responded in a tight whisper. "For now."</p>
		<p>Randi sighed. Her temper had tucked tail and left her. Now she stood here feeling like five kinds of bully. Silence reigned for long moments, as doctor and patient each grappled with their own private demons. "I…um…I need to check a few things," the brunette offered, breaking the silence.</p>
		<p>Green eyes snapped open, filled with equal parts fear and defiance.</p>
		<p>"I just need to do a visual check of your bandages, to make sure your 'exertions' didn't undo them, or cause you to start bleeding again. Then I need to check your BP, heart rate, and pupils. It won't take long, Ms. Galagher, I promise. Then I'll leave you alone so you can get some more rest."</p>
		<p>The blonde pondered this for all of twenty seconds,
			<i> "the sooner she gets this over with, the sooner she'll leave you alone," </i>before nodding her acceptance.
		</p>
		<p>The examination was proceeding smoothly, much to the writer's irritation. She wanted to find something wrong with the doctor's procedure…she
			<b>needed</b> to find something wrong. But the tall woman was being maddeningly efficient, and this frustrated the small woman to no end. Finally, the writer decided she would
			<b>make</b> something wrong.
		</p>
		<p>"Why am I naked?" the blonde inquired, knowing full well the obvious answer.</p>
		<p>"I had to cut off your clothes in order to do a thorough examination and treat all your injuries." If the tall woman was taken aback by the question, she didn't show it, as she shined a light into the smaller woman's eye.</p>
		<p>"Did you enjoy taking my clothes off?" the blonde inquired cattily. "Did you get a quick thrill having a woman laying there naked in front of you?"</p>
		<p>
			<i>Damned if you aren't some piece of work, </i>the doctor mused, as she checked the pupil of the other eye. Betraying no emotion, the brunette put her equipment away, and turning to face the irksome blonde, she crossed her arms and smirked.
		</p>
		<p>"You've been reading too many of your own books, Ms. Galagher. (A) I was too busy saving your life to ogle your…. Assets. (B) The sight of a broken and bloody body does not turn me on. It never has, and it never will. And (C)…" the tall woman quirked a mischievous eyebrow, "don't flatter yourself." With that, she calmly turned and left the room. Leaving the young blonde speechless, embarrassed, and thoroughly miffed.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>"Weeks…I've got to put up with this for weeks," the dark-haired woman huffed aloud, as she hefted the weighted barbell off her chest. "We'll kill each other," she continued through gritted teeth as corded muscles strained to raise the one-hundred-eighty pound barbell one more time. She had retreated to her well-equipped weight room to blow off the excessive steam that had built up during her time spent with the venomous writer. And now, two strenuous hours later, her high ire was reduced to fatalistic grumbling. Her silk boxer shorts and tank top were glued to her lanky frame by the sweat that liberally coated it, and her muscles ached from the extended workout she had put them through. With a final heave, she racked the barbell and slowly lifted her weary body from its prone position. Sitting on the half-bench, the dejected brunette ran her fingers through sweat-dampened hair.
			<i>You're getting a kick out of this, aren't you, Uncle Jake? Whenever I would get down in the dumps, or start feeling sorry for myself over one thing or another, you always told me that a good swift kick in the pants would straighten me out…and you'd be more than happy to provide it. </i>Randi chuckled at the memory of those 'swift kicks' being delivered in the form of a good lengthy tickling; followed by an extended cuddle in warm, strong arms.
			<i>Well, if this situation isn't a kick in the pants, I don't know what is, </i> the tall woman mused, as she exited the room."
			<i>But damned if I didn't like it better when you did it. </i>

	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Eight">
		<p>Something was smelling awfully good. Traveling through sleeping nostrils, down to a thoroughly empty stomach, causing it to grumble in protest of its current state. Bleary green eyes opened to long woodgrain paddles slowly revolving around a milkwhite globe. The eyes idly traveled across the ceiling and down walls that were papered with delicate floral designs. The blonde shifted her head to the right, continuing her perusal, and gasped when her curious green eyes collided with gentle brown ones.</p>
		<p>Randi was in the kitchen, sprinkling mint flakes into a pan of rapidly boiling chicken broth. Dipping a ladle into the fragrant liquid, she scooped some out and gently blew on the steaming contents before taking a taste.
			<i>Hmmm, not bad. </i> The tall woman's taste testing was interrupted by the click-clack of canine toenails on a linoleum floor. The midnight-hued German Shepard ambled into the kitchen and paused in front of the woman.
		</p>
		<p>"I take it she's awake, huh?"</p>
		<p>A brief 'urf' was her answer.</p>
		<p>Randi sighed and turned back to the stove. Picking up a small bowl, she ladled some broth into it and set it on a tray along with a slice of bread and a pitcher of water. Picking up the tray, she turned to her four-legged companion. "Well, here goes round two," she mumbled as she headed down the long hallway.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>"Well, hello there. Aren't you the pretty one," the blonde rasped to her small visitor, earning her a happy, full-body wiggle and spin from the little canine. "You're a little small to be a nurse, so I'm going to hazard a guess that you've been appointed to keep an eye on me for her." This earned the writer a brief, yodeling 'roof'and an upraised paw; bringing an amused smile to the young woman's face.</p>
		<p>"Actually, she appointed herself," came the voice from the doorway. "She seems to think that you could use the company, whether you're awake or not."</p>
		<p>The smile faded from the blonde's face as she looked up at the tall brunette standing in the doorway holding a large tray in her hands. "Well, I certainly prefer her company to…anyone else's," the blonde replied acidly.</p>
		<p>Randi chose to ignore the caustic comment. Striding into the room, she placed the tray on the dresser and looked down at the little dog that had come to greet her. The brunette dropped down to one knee and reached out, gently scratching behind a golden, triangular ear. "Good morning, little lady," she crooned to the little animal, who leaned blissfully into the tender touch. "You did a good job. Now, go get something to eat before your buddy hogs it all." Standing up, she chuckled as the little canine took her warning to heart and scampered out of the room. Stepping into the bathroom to quickly wash her hands, she came back out and addressed her patient, who had been observing her with a mixture of curiosity and pique.</p>
		<p>"And how is Ms. Galagher this morning?"</p>
		<p>"Ms. Galagher is thirsty, hungry, in pain, and has to use the restroom; but other than that, just dandy. Thank you for finally getting around to asking,
			<b>Dr.</b> Oakes," the blonde responded caustically.
		</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry," the Doctor responded sincerely as she approached the bed, "I didn't mean to ignore you. The writer was caught off guard by the gentle response, but didn't show it; choosing instead to remain silent.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Oooh, no catty comeback, color me happy, </i> the tall woman mused. "Well, Ms. Galagher, the good news is, we should be able to do something about all of your complaints. The bad news is, I'm going to have to change your bandages and check your vital signs first."
		</p>
		<p>The blonde woman tensed. "My
			<b>vital signs</b> are fine," she gritted. "My bandages are fine. Just let me have some water and maybe something for the pain, and I'll take care of the rest on my own."
		</p>
		<p>Randi took a deep breath. "Ms. Galagher, I understand this isn't easy for you, considering how you feel about 'my kind', but your first priority is to get better. And my first priority is to do everything in my power to make that happen. If I don't change your bandages, infection can, and will set in. If I don't monitor your signs, I will not know if something is wrong inside your body." Seeing the blonde's posture relax a little, Randi walked over and picked up the water cup. Returning to the bed, she placed the straw to the blonde's lips. "Remember," she cautioned, "small sips."</p>
		<p>Mindful of her last experience, the writer obeyed. Taking a few small sips, pausing, then taking a few more. Finally, having quenched her thirst for the moment, the writer released the straw. Looking up into patient blue eyes, she mumbled a 'thank you.'</p>
		<p>"You're welcome," the tall woman returned. "I need to go to the office to get fresh bandages and antiseptic and a bedpan. I'll be right back."</p>
		<p>"Excuse me?"</p>
		<p>Randi was halfway to the door when the icy question stopped her in her tracks.
			<i> "Oh, shit. I knew this was coming." </i> She turned and grimaced internally at the flushed and furious glare directed her way.
		</p>
		<p>"Did I hear you say 'bedpan'?</p>
		<p>"Uhm, yes."</p>
		<p>"You have
			<b>got</b> to be kidding."
		</p>
		<p>"Actually, no."</p>
		<p>"Well then, you're insane if you think I'm going to endure the humiliation of having you shove a bedpan under my bare ass every time I have to relieve myself." Using her good hand, she pulled back the blanket, keeping the sheet covering her body, tried to rise. "I've endured enough humiliation at your hands, 'Doctor', the bathroom is right…"</p>
		<p>"ALL RIGHT, HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!"</p>
		<p>The no nonsense tone in the tall woman's voice made the writer pause in her attempts to rise. She looked up as the brunette clenched her eyes and took a deep breath, as if mentally counting to ten, then strode back over to the bed. The smaller woman unconsciously pulled back as the taller woman squatted down so that she was at eye level. If the taller woman noticed, she didn't comment.</p>
		<p>"Look, Ms.Galagher," the doctor began, "I'm not going to say that I know how you feel, because I don't. But I
			<b>do</b> understand." Ignoring the blonde's skeptical snort, the doctor continued. "But there are some things you have to understand too. Your left leg is broken, a clean fracture of the Tibia, to be exact. Your right arm is broken as well. The Ulna was fractured severely enough to break through the skin. Your head impacted with something hard enough to result in a mild concussion, as well as a deep laceration that required several stitches. You have a severely bruised abdomen that was caused by your seatbelt doing its job."
		</p>
		<p>"Okay, I get the picture; I'm a fucking mess," the blonde snapped impatiently, "is there a point to this conversation?" The writer was unnerved by the doctor's close proximity; and she
			<b>really</b> had to go to the bathroom.
		</p>
		<p>"Yes, there is," the doctor answered patiently, "and I'm just about to make it. You need a cast on your leg and arm. But I don't have the material here for casts. The best I could do, was splint them and wrap them tightly. If you try to put any pressure on your leg, such as trying to walk to the bathroom, your leg will buckle, and you'll drop like a rock. The resulting damage from that fall will be worse than what you came in here with. That leaves us with only two options: I can catheterize you, which is, in my opinion,
			<b>not</b> an option, or we can use a bedpan."
		</p>
		<p>Randi's heart lurched at the defeated tears that now cascaded down the young woman's face. She always hated to see one of her patient's cry, and even though this woman looked at her as an enemy, it still pained her.</p>
		<p>"Hey," she offered gently, "it won't be that bad. You can pretty much remain covered. I'll elevate your upper body and your bad leg. You can use your good leg to lift yourself, while I slide the pan under you. Then I'll leave you alone for a few minutes, and, when you're finished, we can remove it the same way. How does that sound?"</p>
		<p>"Fine," the heartsick blond mumbled.</p>
		<p>"Great," the relieved doctor replied, as she stood up and hurried out of the room.</p>
		<p>"She's enjoying this," the writer rasped through her tears, to no one in particular. "I don't care how nice she acts. She's getting a perverse pleasure out of having me helpless and at her mercy. Her kind doesn't care about anyone else's pain. They only care about themselves."
			<i>Are you sure about that? </i> A small voice inside her asked. "Of course I'm sure," she mumbled aloud. "I'm living proof of that!"
			<i>Are you sure about that? </i>The small voice repeated, leaving the blonde frustrated and, for the first time in years, uncertain.
		</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Nine">
		<p>Randi had a smile on her face as she gathered the items she would need to tend to Megan.
			<i>Well, she's not blowing kisses at me, but at least she's being a little more agreeable. Maybe it's because
				<b>you're</b> not being such a jerk, Randi.
			</i> The tall woman had to chuckle at the 'duh' quotient of that last thought. "Yeah, that definitely helps," she muttered aloud. Randi thought back to last night. She had lain awake for a long while after she got in bed. That in itself was not unusual; as she had lain awake many nights, her thoughts consumed by grief and guilt. What made last night different, was her preoccupation with a certain strawberry blonde. She could not, for the life of her, understand why she was so impatient with the writer. The young woman was biased and homophobic, true; but Randi had met many such people in her life, and had always been able to overlook their smallmindedness. Why was this woman different? Throughout her life, Randi had been gentle and caring. This was especially evident in her treatment of her patients, regardless of their temperament. Why did she allow the writer to get to her? Randi had no answers. All she knew was that her behavior was inexcusable.
			<i>Uncle Jake would be ashamed. </i> So the pretty Doctor came to the only conclusion she could live with; To knock the damn chip off of her shoulder and treat the blonde with the same kindness and respect that all her patients used to receive, regardless of the younger woman's ill manners.
			<i>And damned if it isn't making a little difference, </i>the brunette mused with a grin as she made her way back to her patient.
		</p>
		<p>"Hi, sorry it took so long," the doctor apologized as she bustled into the room. The blonde offered no response, as she stared morosely at the ceiling. Placing her things on a small folding table she had brought along, the brunette moved over to the bed.</p>
		<p>"Okay Ms.Galagher, we know I have to do some checking and changing, and we also know that you have to answer nature. What would you like to do first? It's your call."</p>
		<p>The young blonde's eyes flew to the doctor's face, searching for some sign of deceit, or condescending attitude. Genuinely surprised at finding neither, and unable to deal with the sincerity in those blue eyes, the writer looked away and mumbled, "I really have to go."</p>
		<p>"Okay, fine," the doctor returned as she moved to the closet. "There are some extra pillows and blankets in here. We can use them to raise your torso and leg a little bit, to make it easier for you to lift and situate yourself."</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>One and a half-hours later, Megan was in that blissfully fuzzy place between the waking world and the peaceful oblivion of sleep. Her belly was somewhat full,
			<i>That broth was actually pretty good. </i> Her bladder was empty.
			<i>That wasn't anywhere near as bad as I thought it would be. </i>Her bandages were changed, and the doctor had given her something for the pain.
			<i>And then she rode off into the sunset…just like the hero in a bad western, </i> the writer giggled to herself as she drifted into the realm of dreams.
		</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Randi lay sprawled in the big recliner. The massive stone fireplace had a roaring fire going, spreading toasty warmth throughout the room. The house was clean, the fireplace re-stocked with wood, and her patient was dozing comfortably. That left nothing for the brunette to do but to curl up with a book and catch up on some reading. A course of action that lasted all of ten minutes before blue eyes drifted closed and the book dropped from limp fingers. All too soon, relaxed muscles became rigid, facial muscles began to twitch, and eyeballs careened wildly beneath closed lids.</p>
		<i>
			<b>
				<p>The hallway seemed to stretch for miles as frantic feet raced along its length. The blue beacon flashed incessantly above the door. Bursting through the door, she found the room was in chaos. A cacophony of voices was vying to be heard. A willowy redhead stood in the far corner, hands covering trembling lips, tears streaming down a pale face. Machines cried out in alarm. A wiry black man in a white lab coat was on the bed, straddling a small body; rhythmically pushing on a small chest while grim faced nurse held a breather bag over an unmoving face. Moving to the bed, she barked, "What the hell's going on?"</p>
				<p>"She started having respiratory distress about a half hour ago," the dark man responded between compressions. "She's rejected any treatment we've tried. She was calling for you. We've been calling and paging," he informed her, not unkindly. " She went into full respiratory arrest about ten minutes ago, and then cardiac arrest just before you walked in. WHERE THE HELL IS THAT CRASH CART?</p>
				<p>As if on cue, the door burst open, as the requested machine was hustled in. Randi reached out and pulled the machine to her. Grabbing the paddles, she barked, "Get this damn thing fired up, STAT!" Turning to the tiny, pale child in the bed, she whispered, "Hang on, Casey. Don't leave me, baby."</p>
			</b>
		</i>
		<hr/>
		<p>The dark head lifted. Blue eyes scanned her surroundings as triangular ears rotated left and right, searching, listening. She heard it again; a faint, keening 'noooo.' Raising up, she cast a glance to her honey-colored companion, who was listening worriedly to the sounds of distress, and then sauntered down the hall. Striding into the livingroom, she approached the recliner and paused, observing the writhing, moaning figure in the chair. With a mental shrug, she reached up and grabbed the nearest shirtsleeve in her teeth, and began to tug.</p>
		<p>Reaction to the tugging was almost immediate, as the raven-haired woman bolted up, ramrod straight, wide-eyed, and gasping. Her disorientation faded quickly as she looked down at the ebony canine that sat there staring at her. The strong, angular chin quivered as she looked into patient blue eyes. "I did it again, didn't I?"</p>
		<p>In answer, the dark canine reached over and lightly nibbled the length of her arm until she hit a spot that made the tall woman jump. "Aahh, you little shit!" Randi was on her feet now, rubbing the sensitive spot and glaring at the arrogant beast who was now sitting on the other side of the room, wagging her tail and looking at the tall woman with, what Randi would swear, was an evil grin.</p>
		<p>Woman and animal locked stares for a long moment, before the woman gave in. "All right, Ze, you win. I'm better now. Although," she chuckled as she squatted down, "I like your partner's remedy a lot better." The raven-haired canine moved closer to the squatting woman, until they were almost nose to nose. "You are
			<b>such</b> an asshole," she grinned to the animal. And had absolutely no chance to dodge the sloppy, wet, pink tongue that slapped her nose.
		</p>
		<p>"Eeeewww!"</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Ten">
		<p>"Rise and shine, Ms. Galagher. A bright, new day beckons!" the brunette announced cheerfully, as she strode into the room carrying a large tray. It was a cheeriness that was decidedly unappreciated by the woman in the bed.</p>
		<p>"I've no intention of rising
			<b>or</b> shining," the blonde grumbled as she reached for the blanket with her good hand, "and the 'bright, new day can kiss my dull, old…" The last word was muffled by the blanket that the small woman threw over her face.
		</p>
		<p>Randi was hard-pressed to contain a chuckle at the unknowing cuteness of that act. Setting the tray on the dresser, she walked over to the bed and squatted down by the bunched up blanket that had blond hairs sticking out.</p>
		<p>"Aw, c'mon now," the brunette cajoled, "surely you don't want to miss out on some nice, hot, fluffy scrambled eggs." The doctor grinned to herself as she watched the blanket creep down, revealing a bleary green eye.</p>
		<p>"A thick slice of tender, juicy ham." The blanket moved down further.</p>
		<p>"Fresh, hot, buttered sourdough bread." The blanket moved down even further, revealing two wide-open green eyes, and a pert nose.</p>
		<p>"Scrambled eggs?" a muffled voice inquired hopefully. The tall woman nodded.</p>
		<p>"Ham?" Another nod.</p>
		<p>"Hot bread and real butter?" A smile and a nod.</p>
		<p>The green eyes narrowed. "This had better not be a trick to get me up, so you can poke and prod."</p>
		<p>Randi feigned a shocked expression. "Me?"…. Never!"</p>
		<p>A snort was the response as the blonde drew down the covers and sighed. "Okay, what do I have to endure in order to eat?"</p>
		<p>"Well," the doctor responded as she stood up, "we have to do the usual checks, check and change your bandages, and you probably have to use the pan, but…." She paused at the crestfallen expression on the young woman's face. "Why don't we let you eat first, so your breakfast doesn't get cold." Randi was rewarded with the first genuine, open smile she had seen since meeting the writer. And it warmed her immeasurably. The tall woman decided, as she helped her patient sit up, that some way…somehow…she would see more of those smiles.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>"Mmmm," the blonde hummed delightedly, as the slightly cheddary flavor of the eggs caressed her palate. This was the first truly solid food she'd had in days. And, while the broth and soups she had been given were good, her stomach was getting really pissed at not being given regular food. Now, as she sat munching contentedly, she would swear she could hear her tummy chanting a litany of 'thank yous'.
			<i>God, who knew she could cook like this? </i> the writer mused as she speared a piece of pre-cut ham.
			<i>Actually, she does a lot of things good; you just refuse to see it, </i>her small voice reprimanded.
			<i>
				<b>"Don't start!"</b>
			</i> she warned the small voice.
			<i>She's only doing this because she has to. Keep telling yourself that, </i> the small voice sneered. Trying to quiet her conflicting thoughts, the writer's mind drifted back to the night before.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Grayson,"</b> the gravelly voice barked into the phone.
		</p>
		<p>"Don't you ever just say 'hello'?" the amused blonde inquired.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Galagher?!"</b> the publisher shouted.
			<b>"Is that you? Jesus Christ, woman, where are you? Are you all right? I've been worried sick about you!" Where in the hell have you been? "</b>The older woman ranted, clearly pissed, but near tears in relief at hearing her young friend's voice.
		</p>
		<p>"I'm uh, I'm okay, Charly." The blonde was clearly struggling to keep from breaking down. But it was so hard. She was so scared…and so alone…and the familiar, caring voice threatened to destroy what little control of her emotions she had left. "I was in an accident." At the quick intake of breath on the other end, the writer hastily reassured, "But I really am okay. I've got a broken arm, and a broken leg, and a mild concussion, but that's all."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"That's all!? Goddamn it, Megan, that's enough!"</b> the distraught publisher bellowed.
			<b>"What? hospital are you in? What room? Who's your doctor?" </b> The older woman was rattling off questions faster than the bemused author could answer them. Before she could respond, she heard footsteps coming down the hall and stopping at her door, followed by a light tapping.
		</p>
		<p>"Hold on a moment, Charly," the blonde instructed before laying the phone down and bidding Randi to enter.</p>
		<p>The tall woman strode into the room with an apologetic grin. "Sorry to bother you," she offered, "but I figured you might want these." She handed over a sheet of paper, accompanied by a legal-looking document and two laminated cards. Megan briefly examined the items in her hand. The sheet of paper contained, in neatly typed order, Randi's full name, address, phone number, vehicle make and license number. The document was her medical certification, and the laminated cards were her driver's license and hospital ID badge. At the blonde's questioning look, the doctor explained, "These are the things I would need to know, if my friend were injured and in a stranger's hands." And, with a gentle smile, the tall woman left the room, leaving the young woman thoroughly flabbergasted by the wisdom, and unexpected kindness of that act. Megan was brought out of her consternation by a muffled shout, as she hastily picked up the phone.</p>
		<p>"Sorry about that," the blonde apologized.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Who was that?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"That was just the doctor."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Is everything okay?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Everything's fine, Charly. She was just dropping off a couple of things. Now, as to your questions, I'm not exactly in a hospital."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Whoa," </b>the older woman interrupted,
			<b>"what do you mean 'not exactly in a hospital? You just said that was a doctor in the room. What the hell's going on, Meg?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"I'll be happy to tell you, sweety, if you'll quit interrupting," the young woman chuckled, earning her an impatient growl. Once the older woman quieted down, the writer filled her in on the events leading up to the present conversation. The publisher's reaction was a long silence, before inadvertently putting her foot in her mouth.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Whoo, talk about sleeping with the enemy,"</b> the older woman blurted, then quickly clapped her hand over her mouth in belated recognition of the ill chosen words.
		</p>
		<p>"That wasn't even close to funny," the icy voice responded.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"You're right, Megan. That was an extremely poor choice of words,"</b> the publisher apologized, mentally kicking herself.
			<b>"I'm really sorry."</b>
		</p>
		<p>The writer chewed on her lip for a long moment before sighing; "it's all right, Charlie. I just…"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"I know, baby,"</b> the older woman responded maternally.
			<b>"But really, personal bias aside, is she treating you okay?</b>
		</p>
		<p>"I suppose," the younger woman allowed. "What choice does she have?"</p>
		<p>The older woman frowned in puzzlement.
			<b> "What do you mean?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"I won't be trapped here forever, Charlie. She knows that. She's taking care of me so I don't have her ass thrown in jail when I get back." The writer paused as an evil thought brought a catty smile to her lips. "Of course, with what goes on in those places, she might feel right at home."</p>
		<p>The publisher dropped her head and scrubbed her eyebrows with the fingers of her free hand.
			<b>
				<i> "Oh, Megan." </i> "Honey, if she were really worried about you having her arrested, don't you think it would have been easier to just leave you in your car?"
			</b>
		</p>
		<p>"She's a pervert, not a murderer," the younger woman huffed.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Thank you for clearing that up for me," </b>the publisher chuckled, amused at the petulant distinction.
			<b>"Seriously, Meg, I would like to find out a little more about this doctor; can you ask her for her full name and perhaps her address? I'd feel a lot better if I knew a little bit more about her and her medical credentials. I've got a few friends in the medical field who can provide me with the information I need."</b>
		</p>
		<p>The blonde glanced at the papers in her hand and smirked. "Got a pen?"</p>
		<p>The older woman gazed at the wealth of information that she had written down in front of her.
			<b>
				<i> "Jeezus, this is damn-near everything but the color of her underwear." </i>
			</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Um, just out of curiosity, how did you get your hands on all this information?"</b>
		</p>
		<p>"Do you remember when she stopped in here earlier?"</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Yeah."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"That's when she just handed me all this stuff. Her hospital ID, driver's license, AMA certificate and personal info. I asked her why, and she just said something like, she'd want to know this stuff if she were you."</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Well, that was certainly nice of her,"</b> the publisher commented, duly impressed by the doctor's proactive response.
		</p>
		<p>"If you say so," the younger woman shrugged.</p>
		<p>
			<b>"Megan, honey, from the sound of things, you're going to be there awhile. How pleasant or unpleasant your stay will be is going to depend on you as much as her. Now, it really looks like she is trying to do right by you." Hearing the indignant snort on the other end, the older woman rushed on. "Look, I know how you feel about gays, lesbians in particular, but I also know that you are an extremely fair and level-headed young woman. I'm not asking you to become best buddies with her, or start putting rainbow stickers on your car. All I'm asking you to do is try looking at her as a person, and not as a symbol. Accept the help she's trying to offer, gracefully. And when the road clears enough for you to get out of there and come home, you won't ever have to see her again."</b>
		</p>
		<p>"It's hard," the young woman responded, her voice cracking, "I look at Dr. Oakes, and I think of 'her'. She wanted me to think she cared for me too, but she didn't. If she did, she never would have left." The young woman's voice was a bare whisper now, and the publisher had to struggle to hear her. "She never called, she never wrote. She had her 'girlfriend'; she didn't need me or daddy anymore."</p>
		<p>The publisher's heart hurt at the pain in those whispered words.
			<b>"Oh, honey, I know. But this woman isn't your mother. She's just a young woman that came to your rescue and, in spite of your differences, is trying to take care of you. Let her out of your mother's shadow, and I promise you, your 'forced vacation' won't be half so bad."</b>
		</p>
		<p>The writer bit her lip and sighed deeply. "I'll try, Charlie."</p>
		<p>Now, in the cold, clear light of day, she wasn't sure she could do as her friend asked. It was good advice, to be sure. But the writer wasn't sure she could look past the tall woman's lifestyle and see the person underneath. Especially since that lifestyle was responsible for the years of pain and feelings of abandonment that she had endured. Megan's introspection was interrupted by a soft knocking on the door.</p>
		<p>"Come."</p>
		<p>A sable-crowned head peeked in the door, wearing a toothy grin. "All done?"</p>
		<p>The writer looked down at her tray, which was cleared of everything but random crumbs.
			<i>I ate all that!? God, I must have been hungry. </i>She looked back to the expectant face at the door;
			<i>you can do this, Meg. </i> "Yes. Thank you."
		</p>
		<p>The lanky physician opened the door wide and walked in, carrying her necessary medical items, and something else that Megan couldn't see, because it was mostly shielded by the woman's body. Placing the unknown item in the deep chair, and the other items on the small table, the doctor approached the bed.</p>
		<p>"Breakfast was okay?" The doctor inquired, as she removed the tray to the dresser.</p>
		<p>"Very good, thank you."</p>
		<p>"You're quite welcome," the doctor responded with a warm smile that the young woman found hard not to return. "Okay, we've got breakfast done," she announced as she returned to the bed. "Now we have to do a check and change, and you, I'm sure, have to answer nature's call. Again, Ms. Galagher, the choice is yours. What would you prefer to do next?"</p>
		<p> Megan again searched the tall woman's face, searching for something…anything…that would reveal the insincerity she was sure the doctor possessed. But all she found was an open and honest warmth that, on some deep level, shamed the young woman. "I, uhm, I really have to go," the writer responded.</p>
		<p> "No problem," the doctor reassured, as she moved to the closet for the items she would need.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Charlotte Grayson picked up her private line for the tenth time. And for the tenth time, she paused.
			<i>She would kill you if she found out, </i> her head shouted. But she's worried sick, the heart argued.
			<i>It's not going to kill you to let her know that everything's all right. You don't have to write her a book. Just give her the basics and ease her mind. She deserves that much. </i> "Arrghh, I hate this!" the publisher growled, as she dialed the memorized number. She listened to one-and-a-half rings before the other end picked up. "She's all right," the publisher announced briskly. "She wrecked in the snow up there, and broke an arm and leg, but she's being taken care of." The older woman listened for a moment, then resumed speaking. "No, she's not in a hospital. The woman that found her is a retired doctor who lives up the road from where she crashed. The ambulance was tied up, and the roads were too bad to try and get to the hospital, so the doctor brought her to her home. The downside is that they are snowbound. It'll be weeks before she can get out of there." Charlie listened to the voice on the other end for a moment, and with a mirthless chuckle responded, "It's a downside because the good doctor just happens to be gay." The silence on the other end was long and deafening before the publisher heard a muffled sob. "Look…she'll be all right," the editor consoled. "This may be the best thing that could have happened to her. This may force her to look at things through eyes that have been closed for years. Yes…..I'll keep you informed." With that uttered assurance, Charlotte Grayson hung up the phone.
			<i>Forgive me, Megan. </i>
