<!-- Snowbound \ Chapter Six -->

<p>Randi pulled up and positioned the Jeep parallel to the front steps of the sprawling ranch house that she called home. Throwing the vehicle in park and setting the emergency brake, Randi turned and addressed her unconscious passenger. "All right, Megan?we're at my house. I've got to run up and open some doors, so I can carry you in. I'll be right back." Leaving the motor and heater running, the tall woman bounded up the snow-packed steps. Propping open the door to the screened-in porch, she stepped quickly into the house, side-stepping the happy canines that came to greet her. "Not now, ladies?we've got company, and I've got to get her in here and settled ASAP." As if understanding, the furry pair wandered out to the porch and sat down, silently observing the large, humming creature that sat in front.</p>
		<p>Randi's mind was racing as she traveled down the long hallway, toward the back half of the house, pausing in front of the powder-blue door that she hadn't opened in months. Sighing, Randi opened the door and turned on the light, battling the waves of melancholy that washed over her as she stood in the small treatment room and office of Dr. Jacob Oakes. Even though he was retired from practice, the elder Oakes insisted on keeping a well-stocked office in case his farming neighbors needed assistance. The nearest medical facility was in Knox, a full thirty miles away; much too far away for some injuries that came with using heavy farming equipment. Over the years there had been more than a few ranchers, farmers, and pregnant mothers that were thankful for the old man's foresight. Just as Randi was thankful for it now, as she jogged out to the Jeep.</p>
		<p>Within moments, the raven-haired doctor had the petite writer lying on the examining table. "Okay, Megan, the first thing I have to do is take care of that nasty head wound of yours." The tall woman continued her one-sided conversation with the patient, no longer sure if it was for Megan's benefit, or her own. "This is going to need some stitches. I'm pretty sure you're not feeling
			<b>anything</b> right now, but, just in case, I'm going to administer a local anesthetic." Moving to the locked cabinet, she pulled out a disposable syringe, a bottle of Lignocaine, 1%, and a pack of Ethilon suture. Snagging the rolling stool with her foot, she settled beside the blonde head and began her work.
		</p>
		<p>Randi stood and stretched, groaning as stiff and aching muscles protested the action. A full two hours had passed while she reset bones, splinted limbs, stitched and bandaged wounds, and performed a more thorough examination of the unconscious woman. Her vital signs were greatly improved, and another check of the pupils showed them to be slightly more reactive, much to the tall woman's relief. An injection of antibiotics finished the treatment.</p>
		<p>"Well now, I guess the only thing left to do is to get you into a bed and sit and wait for you to wake up. I'm going to throw some sheets on the bed in the spare room. Be right back."</p>
		<p>Randi hastened to the spare bedroom, grabbing sheets and a blanket from the linen closet on the way. As she began to make the bed, a sudden thought made her pause.
			<i>Better to be safe than sorry, </i>she decided, as she went back to the linen closet and pulled down a plastic fitted sheet. Upon completion of the bed, the brunette returned to her patient.
		</p>
		<p>"All right then, Ms. Megan, let's get you settled into a real bed." The doctor gently lifted the strawberry blonde into her arms, being mindful of the splinted limbs, and carried her to the other room. Once she had the smaller woman settled, the dark-haired doctor decided she would have some time to tend to her own needs before her patient regained consciousness.</p>
		<p>As she turned to leave the room, Randi noticed, with no small amusement, two furry heads peeking around the edge of the doorframe. "Well, aren't we the nosy ones," she chided. </p>
		<p>The little golden one had the grace to duck her head, as if in embarrassment, while her larger midnight companion merely cocked a triangular head; a gesture that was clearly doggie language for 'and your point is??'</p>
		<p>Randi chuckled at the furry pair as she moved past them and down the hall. "Keep an eye on her," the doctor called back. "Let me know if she starts to wake up." The two canines looked at each other, then to the unmoving human in the bed. With a mutual sigh, they curled up in the doorway, facing the bed.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Randi finally felt human again. A quick, hot shower and warm, dry clothes had done wonders for her aching body. Now, she sat in her kitchen, munching on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and listening to the latest weather reports. Not much had changed from the first report she had heard this morning. The falling snow would vary in intensity, but would still continue until at least Thursday evening. The exhausted woman sighed and hung her head.
			<i>Great! It'll be a month before they can clear the road leading up here. And I get to spend that whole month with the delightful Ms. Galagher. Maybe I should just shoot myself now and get it over with. </i> "Oh, well," she muttered aloud, "at least it won't be boring." Picking up the phone, she dialed a familiar number. "I'd better let Toby know what's going on up here, in case someone comes looking for her."
		</p>
		<p>A short while later, armed with a paperback book, a thermos of coffee, and a comforter, the tall woman padded back to the room where her patient lay. She would be keeping a vigil over the injured woman until she awakened. The woman stopped short as she approached the doorway and chuckled as she looked down at her appointed 'watchers.' The big black canine was sprawled on her back, snoring contentedly. Her golden companion lay horizontally, with her head resting comfortably across the black's neck. "Damned if you two aren't named right," the woman grinned as she stepped over the cozy pair.</p>
		<p>Laying her things at the end of the bed, the tall woman went back into the office to fetch several items that she would need close-by over the next few days. Returning to the bedside, she placed them neatly on the nightstand next to the bed, then proceeded to do a quick check of the blonde's pulse, respiration, blood pressure and pupils. Finding them all satisfactory, she gathered up her things and ambled over to the big, overstuffed armchair that was located by the window. Randi sighed as she curled her tall frame into the inviting softness. She had always loved this old chair. Growing up, it was her fortress, her cocoon?a warm, quiet place where a teenage girl could sit and dream and ponder the mysteries of life as she gazed at the stars through her window.
			<i>Nothing's changed Uncle Jake?I'm still pondering. Only now, it's not so much the mysteries of life, as the unfairness of it. She shouldn't have died, Uncle Jake?I should have been there?but I wasn't?and she died! I'm sorry, Uncle Jake. </i> Her throat burned with the sob that she was trying to suppress, as a lone teardrop escaped her tightly closed eyes.
			<i>I'm so sorry, Casey. </i>
		</p>
		<p>The heartsick woman was startled from her grief as a small, leathery pad touched her hand. Watery, blue eyes flew open and were captured by soft brown orbs that gazed up at her with almost human compassion. Then the small golden creature that more closely resembled a fox than a dog, gingerly crawled up into her lap; a soft, little tongue snaked out, snatching away the errant tear, before the petite head lay gently upon her shoulder. "Thank you, baby," the tall woman sighed, as she buried her face in the sweet-smelling fur. This scene was not new. It had been played out many times over the last several months. Her silent companions always seemed to know when the guilt and pain would overcome her?and they would be there. The little one would offer her best canine imitation of a heartfelt hug; and the beautiful black would sit beside them, silent and unmoving, as if offering comfort by the mere strength of her presence. </p>
		<p>And she sat there now, once again, offering support in the best way she knew how. She would remain here, a silent sentinel, keeping watch as Morpheus lured her two companions into his realm.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>She was tumbling, falling. Flashes of white and green and brown filling her vision like an insane kaleidoscope. And then, mercifully, oblivion. Now the world outside was pulling her from her cozy darkness?and she really didn't want to go?it hurt too much. "Oh, God," she croaked in a voice she barely recognized as her own. She wanted to move?. she really did, but even a little stretch of stiff limbs had hurt. "Owww," she said through clenched teeth, as tears leaked out of tightly closed eyes.</p>
		<p>"Easy," the silky, deep voice cajoled her, as a cool hand brushed wisps of hair from her eyes.</p>
		<p>
			<i>Who?? Why does that voice sound familiar? </i> Unwilling eyelids fluttered, finally giving way, as bleary green orbs brought into focus the face behind the voice.
		</p>
		<p>"You!"</p>
		<p>"Afraid so."</p>
		<p>"Aw, shit!"</p>
