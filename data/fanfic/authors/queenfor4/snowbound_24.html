<!-- Snowbound \ Chapter Twenty-Four -->

<p>Megan navigated the busy evening streets with the ease of one long accustomed to city traffic. Her body was fully in tune with the task at hand, but her mind was in another place altogether. Her reunion with her mother was everything she hoped for and nothing like she expected. Oh, there was a rough spot or two, but the end result was?</p>
		<p>Sweet.</p>
		<p>And Cait was an added bonus.</p>
		<p>She expected a cautious relationship at best with the sturdy, somewhat-stoic woman ... a wary, semi-tolerance between the two of them as they grudgingly shared the attention of the petite, hazel-eyed woman.</p>
		<p>
			<i>God, was I ever wrong! She's generous?and gentle?and funny. She treats me like a favorite niece. I think I would have had fun growing up with her around.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>And that's another thing!</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>I thought I'd be uncomfortable being around them as a 'couple,' but I wasn't. They were kind to each other ... playful, affectionate. All the things I never saw between Mother and Daddy. I could
				<b> feel</b> the love between them. And what makes it even better is that it wasn't exclusive; they pulled me right in there with them.
			</i>
		</p>
		<p>Quite unbidden, her thoughts turned once again to a certain blue-eyed beauty.
			<i>Is that what it could be like with Randi? I know Charly's right, and that Randi cares for me. But is it as a friend, or?</i>
		</p>
		<p>Megan gasped involuntarily as realization hit her right between the eyes.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<i>Cait! The look in her eyes every time she looked at mother. That's the same look Randi would get when she looked at me! I never saw it. I was so busy being a bitch over the love I thought I lost, that I never saw the love that was right there in front of me. </i>Megan wanted to pound her head against the steering wheel.
			<i> Jesus, I'm an idiot! </i>
		</p>
		<p>Megan stole a glance at her watch as, with a push of the button on the device attached to her windshield, she activated the security gate of the underground-parking garage for her apartment complex.
			<i>Ten-thirty. That shouldn't be too late to call her. Oh, God, what am I going to say? 'Hi, Randi?I'm a jerk?I think I love you. But, just to be sure, can I come back up there, and we can try that dancing and kissing thing again?' </i> The blonde turned her car off and shook her head at the sheer silliness of that line.
			<i> Oh, yeah, that'd go over well. The first thing I need to do is say I'm sorry and then see what happens from there. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Satisfied with that course of action, the blonde emerged from her car and activated the alarm, tucking her keys and cell phone in the pockets of her light winter jacket. Megan's step was light as she strolled to the elevator, her thoughts so focused on blue eyes and midnight-kissed hair that she never realized she wasn't alone.</p>
		<p>Not until she heard him.</p>
		<p>"Well, well, well. So you haven't dropped off the face of the earth after all."'</p>
		<p>Megan let out an involuntary squawk as she spun around to face the speaker.</p>
		<p>"God, Eric. You scared the shit out of me," the blonde scolded.</p>
		<p>Eric was leaning casually against one of the massive stone columns that riddled the underground parking garage. Dressed in form-fitting black jeans, tan polo shirt and charcoal Hush Puppies, he looked every bit the all-American boy next door.</p>
		<p>"Sorry about that," he apologized insincerely. "But it seems that the only way to talk to you is to sneak up on you."</p>
		<p>"You had plenty of chances to talk to me while I was recovering at Randi's house."</p>
		<p>Eric shrugged and grinned contritely. "I had some old friends come into town. I got caught up hanging with them."</p>
		<p>"Uh-huh. So 'caught up' that you couldn't return my calls?even to see how I was doing." It was more a statement than a question.</p>
		<p>The sandy blonde-haired man shrugged away from the column and sauntered toward the writer, employing, once again, the boyish charm and sensual charisma that had always worked on her in the past. "What can I say, sweetheart? I'm a scoundrel." He moved in close to the young woman who maintained a stiff reserve and stroked her cheek with a crooked finger. "A scoundrel who's really missed you," he purred.</p>
		<p>"You missed my money is more like it," she replied coolly, stepping back to put some distance between them.</p>
		<p>Eric stiffened momentarily at the truth of her observation before plastering on a rakish smile as he closed the distance between them again. "That's not true, sweetheart. I've missed your smile, your laugh, your sweet voice." He leaned in, nuzzling her ear with his nose and taking a deep breath. "I've really missed your sweet, sexy perfume," he murmured throatily.</p>
		<p>"Mmm," she hummed. "I don't see how. Your clothes reek of it." the blonde bit out, pushing him away. "The only problem is, I wear Opium, you shit, not Obsession! Get the hell out of here, Eric. The bank, as well as the bed-and-breakfast, is closed." With that, she turned and headed toward the elevator.</p>
		<p>The realization that he had lost his meal ticket hit home. "You bitch," was snarled as he lunged after the retreating blonde.</p>
		<p>Megan had no time to react before her arm was grabbed in an iron grip and she was pulled backwards. The breath exploded from her lungs as she was slammed back against a dark sedan. Before she had a chance to gather her wits, he was on her. Grabbing a fistful of her hair, he yanked her head back viciously as his other hand pulled at the buttons on her shirt. "You fucking bitch," he snarled as he gave up on the buttons and ripped open her shirt. "You think you can use me as your trophy boy and fuck buddy for months, and then just blow me off? Think again, whore!"</p>
		<p>Megan's shock and disorientation were fading rapidly, being replaced by anger and outright fury. "Fuck buddy, my ass! You weren't even that good," she snarled as one hand came up and raked his face with sharp, short nails, while the other slammed into his chest and shoved, propelling him away from her.</p>
		<p>As Eric stumbled backwards, clutching his face, the frantic writer made a dash for the stairwell, hoping against hope that she could outrun him long enough to get to the lobby and find help.</p>
		<p>Her hopes were dashed as a hand grabbed the back of her jacket collar and jerked her backward forcefully, causing her to lose her footing and fall to the ground. She had no sooner hit the concrete deck than Eric was on her, straddling her thighs and pinning her down.</p>
		<p>Pain exploded across her face as Eric's half-closed fist connected with her cheek, stunning her and rendering her helpless as he continued to pummel her viciously about the head and chest.</p>
		<p>After a seeming eternity, the blows stopped, and Eric sat back panting heavily and staring at the battered woman beneath him. Megan's eyes were closed, but he could tell that she was still conscious, which suited him fine. He wanted her aware of what was coming next.</p>
		<p>"I know you're awake, Meg," he stated matter-of-factly as he unfastened the belt of her pants. "And that's good. I want you awake for this." Deft fingers unsnapped the button of her pants and pulled down the zipper. "The bank might be closed, you bitch, but I intend to make one last withdrawal," he hissed as he lifted a leg so he could pull down her pants.</p>
		<p>Megan lay dazed, her tenuous grasp on consciousness aided only by the intense, throbbing pain that radiated throughout her head and torso. Her limbs felt heavy and leaden; even the thought of moving hurt. Eric's voice echoed hollowly in her ears. She knew what he had in mind, and a small part of her wished she could finish passing out so that she wouldn't be awake for it.
			<i>Maybe this is what I deserve, </i>she thought dully as she felt her zipper being lowered.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Bullshit! This is not what you deserve! </i> The voices of Randi, Charly, Laura and Cait ... the ones that loved her ... thundered through her head, blasting through the cobwebs. Megan's eyes popped open as she felt the body above her shift and give her just enough room for?
		</p>
		<p>Eric screamed as a hard thigh slammed into his unprotected crotch and a small, powerful fist connected with his nose. He fell back, one hand clutching his freely bleeding nose, while the other one clutched his screaming groin.</p>
		<p>Megan looked around quickly, trying to get her bearings, and almost sobbed with relief as her eyes landed on her vehicle, less than ten feet away. She knew if she could make it to her car, she could lock herself in before he could get to her ... an advantage she would not have if she tried to use the stairs or the elevator.</p>
		<p>Reaching into her jacket pocket, she pulled out her keys and quickly pressed the button to disable the alarm and unlock the doors, then scrambled on hands and knees to the waiting vehicle.</p>
		<p>Upon reaching her car, Megan pulled open the door and launched herself inside, slamming the door behind her and locking it. Heaving a relieved sigh, the battered blonde slumped in the seat and let her swollen eyes slide close.
			<i>Just for a moment?I just need a moment. </i>
		</p>
		<p>She never got that moment. Megan yelped in alarm as the car rocked from the force of a body slamming against it. She stared at the bloody, wild-eyed face of her former lover as he furiously pulled on the door handle with one hand and pounded on her window with the other, all the while screaming invectives at her.</p>
		<p>The young woman could take no more; her fight-or-flight instincts were screaming at her, and the flight instinct won. Jamming her key in the ignition, she started the car, threw it into gear and pressed on the accelerator, flinching as Eric's fist impacted with the window one last time before the vehicle's momentum tore his hand from the door handle and sent him crashing to the ground.</p>
		<p>Megan refused to look back as she sped away from the scene of the attack. Her body was still in full flight mode as she activated the gate and exited the garage. Unsure of where she was going, she only knew that she had to get away ... far away. She knew she was a mess; three quarters of her face felt puffy, swollen and throbbed with pain. She could feel the hot stickiness of blood on her face, could taste it on her lips; every breath she took sent daggers of pain shooting through her chest and back. And she idly wondered why she didn't just pull over somewhere and let herself pass out.
			<i> Someone will find me eventually. </i>
		</p>
		<p>But something inside her vehemently rejected that option, as, prodded by sheer, unconscious instinct, she continued to drive, wholly unsure of where she was going, but certain that she had to get there.</p>
		<p>Before long, she found herself on the interstate headed out of New York.</p>
		<p>Realization finally set in.</p>
		<p>And swollen, cracked lips etched a small, knowing smile.</p>
		<p>Megan reached in her jacket pocket and extracted her cell phone.
			<i>God, I hope it didn't get broken in the scuffle. </i>
		</p>
		<p>Flipping it open, she breathed a silent thank you when the tiny screen and keypad came to neon-green life. Punching a button from the memory, she waited while the call connected.</p>
