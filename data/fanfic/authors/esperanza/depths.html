<p>Cordy was flipping idly through an old issue of Vogue when
 the door to Angel Investigations opened, revealing a very
nervous looking Kate. Cordy looked up expectantly, and
sighed in annoyance as Kate just stood there.</p>

<p>"Is there something you need, Kate?" Cordy prodded, trying
to go into secretary mode like Angel taught her but her patience
was wearing thin and she briefly considered telling Kate they
were closed. Cordelia Chase was just not cut out to be a secretary.</p>

<p>"Is Angel here?" Kate asked, holding up a work file.</p>

<p>"No, he's off rescuing some nonpaying client, which means I'm not
going to be getting a paycheck. But I guess you could wait for
him, if you really wanted to."</p>

<p>Cordy waved at the chair opposite of her before, returning to her
magazine.</p>

<p>Kate nodded and sighed, exhausted and sick of this stupid case,
before taking the seat offered by Cordelia. Angel had become Kate's
lifesaver whenever a case got too frustrating or she got too
stressed. She'd just bring it to Angel and within 48 hours, he
usually had it solved. It was a hell of a lot better than asking
someone at the station for help.</p>

<p>Cordy looked up to see Kate leafing through the file she had with
her, and she could see how tired and stressed Kate was by just the way she held herself.</p>

<p>"You know, you seem a lot different from the last time I saw you."
Cordy started as Kate looked up. "The last time I saw you were
quite open and seemed to be prone to crying episodes.
Oh, and you kept talking about your dad!"</p>

<p>"Sorry, about that. I'm usually less, " Kate seemed to
fumble for the appropriate word.</p>

<p>"Completely out of your mind?" Cordy supplied helpfully
and Kate blushed slightly, making Cordelia think that
Kate could be really beautiful if she wanted to be.</p>

<p>"Yeah." Kate said, catching Cordy's eye and holding it
for a little bit longer than necessary, making Cordy
blushed slightly this time and look away. The moment was
clear and both women understood what had just happened:
Kate had attempted
to flirt with Cordelia. Cordy wasn't sure how she was supposed
to react while Kate was beating herself up over the completely
inappropriate move.</p>

<p>Silence descended over the two women as each tried to figure
out how to break the tension. Cordelia finally got fed up and blurted
out, </p>

<p>"Were you just trying to flirt with me?"</p>

<p>Kate's cheeks became rosy and she ducked her head slightly,
telling herself she should have known that this was not a
good time to go flirting, even if Cordelia was the most
beautiful woman she had ever seen.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I guess I was. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Don't be sorry!" Cordelia jumped in quickly. " I mean,
it's flattering. I don't think that I've ever had a woman
flirt with me before." Cordelia made the cutest face trying
to remember, and Kate couldn't help but highly doubt she was
the first woman to flirt with Cordelia. </p>

<p>Cordy looked at Kate unsure for a moment, and Kate couldn't
help feel like she was being sized up. Not that being sized
up by Cordelia Chase was a bad thing; it just presented the
risk of coming up short.</p>

<p>"Are you, like, a lesbian or something?" Cordelia asked
suddenly. </p>

<p>"Yeah." Kate answered, watching, as Cordy seemed to have
an internal debate. Kate guessed Cordelia hadn't had much
contact with people who were gay, judging by her reaction.</p>

<p>"But, why? You are beautiful; you could probably have any man
you wanted." Cordelia said. She couldn't help but feel perplexed.
When she thought of lesbians, she thought of Ellen or the
popular image of the hairy, butch feminist. She thought of
woman who, honestly, probably couldn't get a good man.
Kate was different, she was beautiful, smart, and was still
a lesbian? Kate felt her mouth drop slightly, unsure if
she wanted to laugh or be outraged at what Cordy was
saying. Seeing the other girl's genuine puzzlement,
Kate decided neither would be the wisest path.</p>

<p>With an amused smile she gently explained, "Cordelia, I'm
not gay because I can't get a man. I'm gay because I like
woman and feel attracted to them. I think woman are beautiful
and desirable, and strong, sweet, and smart." Kate said adding,
"At least some of them."</p>

<p>"Oh." Cordy replied, her brain running over what Kate just
told her.Kate could see that she had just tried to explain
something that nearly impossible to explain to people who
didn't understand and she wasn't sure how Cordy was taking it.
On one hand, Cordy hadn't gone screaming into the night but
on the other hand, she had really said anything. Kate
decided it would be best if she disappeared for a while.</p>

<p>"Look, I'm going to leave this file for Angel. Tell him
to call me." Kate said as he got up and left a slightly
stunned Cordelia who had a rather pensive look on her face.</p>

<p align=center>******</p>

<p>"Dennis, I'm home!" Cordelia yelled as she entered her seemingly empty
apartment at a little after two in the morning. She threw her mail and
keys on the hall table and went straight to the kitchen, famished
since Angel didn't exactly keep his fridge full of stuff she could eat. Pulling out a carton of coffee ice cream she went over and flopped down on the couch. It was late but she wasn't at all tired, her body used to the weird hours required when you worked for an ensouled vampire.</p>

<p>"Can we talk?" Cordelia said after a moment of
peaceful silence where her thoughts seemed to
drift back to the conversation she had with Kate
earlier. It was pretty much all she had been thinking about.</p>

<p>After a second, Cordelia could hear a distinct knock,
signaling yes. Living with a ghost had proved to be
pretty easy once they set up some ground rules. Dennis
wasn't allowed in her bedroom or bathroom and he had to
remain quiet when she had company, unless it was Doyle
and Angel. They had even set up a way of communicating
with one knock meaning yes and two meaning no.</p>

<p>"I found out that woman I told you about, Kate, the one
I thought had a thing for Angel is actually a lesbian.
Do you know what means? It's when, " Cordy started to
explain but was cut off by a sharp, impatient knock.
"Okay, I was just making sure."</p>

<p>"It's just there weren't many gay people in Sunnydale,
at least I didn't know any, although I had my doubts
about Faith. But she was twisted. It's not like I think
all gay people are twisted because Kate seems cool but
it was never something that affected my life." Cordy
said, licking the ice cream off the spoon. "It was
just something that people talked about or that was
on television."</p>

<p>"Now there someone who I know is a lesbian in my life,
and I don't think it's so weird. In fact, it seems
pretty normal, you know? This is the nineties." Cordy
said and Dennis replied with a knock."Dennis, I don't
know what exactly this means but I've been having these
thoughts ever since I talked to Kate." Cordy admitted,
a blush rising to her cheeks.</p>

<p>It had been so long, not since her painful breakup
with Xander that she had felt like this. This heart
flutter that was impossible to name but seemed to be
the only pure thing that ever existed. "I mean, I would
be lying if I said I had never thought about it before,
because I have but I just ignored it." Cordelia was
quiet for a moment, lost in her own thoughts, before
suddenly asking, "Do you think there is anything wrong
with being gay, Dennis?" After a moment of apparent
thought, two knocks sounded, meaning no. Cordy couldn't
help but smile.</p>

<p>"This is something deep in me that I've never wanted to face,
never thought I could, but things are so different now.
My life here can be whatever I want to be, away from my
parents, and Sunnydale society, and Harmony and her sheep."
Cordy said softly. "It's scary, though."</p>

<p>"I can't help but be scared of what it means to admit
that I'm attracted to woman. It makes me different and
I don't know, you have to have a certain amount of
strength for that. There aren't many things that scare
me but making myself different, to open myself up to
ridicule is one fear I can't imagine ever over. What
would Doyle and Angel say?" Cordy licked her spoon
clean for a final time before putting the ice cream
away and the spoon in the dishwasher. She was slowly
learning how to keep her apartment clean, a skill
she never had to learn when she was younger.</p>

<p>"But being who I am, being able to be honest about
this thing I always kept hidden, well, it outweighs
all that. Does that make sense?" A knock sounded and
Cordy smiled."You know what its like, sorta, don't
you? To feel a certain way even if people disapprove."
Cordy paused and a faint knock sounded, quieter,
signaling Dennis didn't want to talk anymore. She tried
talking to him about his mother and fiance before, only
to have him close up on her and refuse to come out for
days. He didn't even leave her messages with the magnetic
poetry on the fridge like he usually did. Today's
message said, "We should have Xmas dinner with A and D."</p>

<p>"Christmas dinner with Angel and Doyle is a good idea, "
Cordelia called knowing that even if he didn't want to
talk, Dennis could still hear her.</p>

<p align=center>******</p>

<p>As Cordelia took a long hot shower and got ready for bed,
her mind stayed on Kate and all the things she had dared
to think tonight. What did the meaning of her thoughts?
As much as she was afraid to admit it, Cordelia knew she
would never understand unless she took that step, that
jump that frightened and excited her at the same time.
If she didn't, it would just stay another thing that
she let slip away from her, another truth about herself
that she let keep hidden. She had done it so many times,
to fit in, or to keep appearances of the happy Chase
family up.</p>

<p>Kate fascinated Cordy and she couldn't get her mind off
the beautiful, strong cop who seemed so unafraid to admit
these truths about who she was. Cordy remembered talking to
her and how amazing she looked when she blushed that faint
blush and how incredible her lips were, perfect for all the
things that Cordy couldn't get her mind off. The way she talked,
so confident and the way she spoke of women, it made Cordy
feel her heart flutter and a desire in her that she hadn't
felt in so long that it had become almost foreign to her
but here it was, back when Cordy thought of Kate.</p>

<p>Cordelia climbed into bed and sighed, her heart pounding
like it hadn't done in years. She had to do it, to admit
to herself and others what she had struggled to keep
hidden for so long. She was going to take that step and
Cordy knew exactly whom she wanted to take it with.</p>

<p align=center>******</p>

<p>Cordelia narrowed her eyes as she fiddled with the
business card in her hand, trying to gather the courage
to just call Kate. She was thankful Doyle and Angel had
gone out again so she didn't have to do this in their
presence. When she had come to work to work this morning
 she had known exactly what she was going to say but
suddenly, faced with the idea of actually calling Kate
and asking her out on a date seemed like the scariest
thing in the world. This was the final step. This made
it all real for her, and Cordy couldn't help having
second thoughts.</p>

<p>What if Kate actually said yes? That meant they would
go on an actual date, together. It was the most
exciting, scary, wonderful thought Cordy could imagine.
Cordy had been on hundreds of dates in her short life,
most ended being just a waste of time, but she had
never felt this way about the idea of spending time
with someone. A date meant getting dressed up and
going out to dinner, Kate and Cordy would talk and
even share a goodnight kiss. Cordy's hand went up
to her mouth instinctively at the thought of kissing
Kate and trembled at the thought of their soft lips
pressed together. Would it be like kissing a guy? Or
would it be softer, sweeter, and make her tingle all
over like she always secretly imagined?</p>

<p>First Cordelia had to get up the guts to actually
call her.</p>

<p>"Get a grip. You are Cordelia Chase." She murmured to
herself as she picked up the phone. She was scared to a
degree, but it was more than just that. This was the
final step in admitting the truth about herself and
not having to pretend so much anymore. Her hand shaking,
 she dialed the numbers.</p>

<p>"Detective Lockley, " Kate answered in her tough-cop voice.
Okay, it's now or never.</p>

<p>Cordy took a deep breath and plunged right in.
"Kate? This is Cordelia. I'm sorry that I'm calling
you at work."</p>

<p>"It's okay, Cordy." Kate said, her voice growing softer
when she heard who it was. After their conversation
yesterday, Kate never thought Cordelia would speak to her,
much less call her at work. Kate's heart started beating
a little faster, despite the fact she was sure this call
was probably business.</p>

<p>"I was just wondering if you would you like to take me to
dinner sometime?" Cordy asked suddenly, knocking Kate
from her thoughts. She opened her mouth to reply but
found that her throat was suddenly not working properly.
This amazingly beautiful woman, who Kate tried not to
think about, was asking her out on a date. Suddenly,
 her heart was pounding and her breathing seemed to
even speed up. It had been so long since anyone had
made her feel this way.</p>

<p>Cordy could not breathe as she waited for Kate to
say something, anything.</p>

<p>"I would love to take you to dinner." Kate finally
said softly and Cordy could help but break out into
a huge grin. She had just done the one thing she
thought she'd never do. Cordelia Chase just called
up at a woman she was interested in and asked her
on a date. And she had said yes. Cordy couldn't help
but feel that it was the most incredible, honest
thing she ever done. It was like the truth was out,
that Cordy was attracted to women, but suddenly what
people thought didn't matter so much. She didn't care
about what people said or thought about her. She could
worry about that later, after she got off the phone.
Right now, all she cared about was that Kate had said yes.</p>

<p align=center>******</p>

<p>Cordy stared at herself in the mirror, trying to decide if she looked all right or not. She couldn't remember being this nervous about a date in years. Getting dressed for her date with Kate had taken her forever and she had changed three times, and still wasn't sure if she was happy with the results. She had finally decided on a short black skirt and a black tank top that was accented by sequins and rhinestones. Her hair was down and curled in that sort of wavy way she really liked. But would Kate like it? </p>

<p>"Dennis, " Cordy called, walking out of her bedroom, "Do you think I look good?" She turned around and there was a very loud, definite knock signaling yes. </p>

<p>"Thanks." Cordy said, smiling. Sometimes living with someone wasn't all that bad. </p>

<p>Five minutes later, there was a knock at the door. Grabbing her purse, she glanced in the mirror one more time and then opened the door to see Kate standing there, looking just as nervous as Cordy was and just as beautiful. She was wearing a short, spaghetti-strap dress and her blonde hair was pulled up with strands hanging down. If Cordy's heart could possibly go any faster, it did at the sight of Kate. </p>

<p>Kate could barely believe she was here, taking Cordelia out on a date. She looked so incredibly beautiful and sexy that it felt like Kate stopped breathing for second. "Ready to go?" </p>

<p>"Yeah." Cordy said, slightly breathless and closed the door behind her.</p>

<p>They rode the elevator in silence, just casting glances at each other until Kate reached over and touched Cordy's arm. "You look beautiful." She said softly and Cordy felt like her heart might burst. She couldn't stop the smile from spreading her face.</p>

<p>"Thank you. So do you." Cordelia replied and Kate smiled this little smiled that seemed to make things a little bit easier for Cordy. Whatever might happen tonight was okay, whatever she might be risking was okay because it was worth it.</p>

<p align=center>******</p>

<p>After the initial discomfort, the two women fell into
easy conversation with each other. Most of the time
Cordelia's dates were filled with inane conversation
about stupid things,
but Kate didn't go on about the things her dates
usually
did or ask idiotic questions. She was smart and
seemed to
actually care about what Cordy was talking about.
Plus,
Kate made her laugh.</p>

<p>It was like everything seemed perfect all of the
sudden.
Cordelia could hardly believe that she was a great
date w
ith Kate, a beautiful woman and it felt so right.
They were at the cutest Italian restaurant and Cordy
had expected to be concerned about what might happen
or what the other customers thought about the two of
them having dinner together but Kate had a way of making
her forget all the stuff she thought she'd worry about.
Instead, she found herself talking about Angel and Doyle,
about her dream of being an actress and even a little bit
about Sunnydale. Cordy had almost slipped up twice about
the vampire bit and the true nature of Angel Investigations
but had managed to recover before Kate asked questions.</p>

<p>"You get used to Angel after a while, even though he has
a tendency to brood and refuse to ask clients for any money.
How can you run a business without billing your clients?"
Cordy said as she sipped her dinner cappuccino.</p>

<p>Kate smiled at Cordy's exasperated question."Well,
that's one positive thing about working for the city.
You get a regular paycheck, no matter how small it
may be." Kate said. The waiter suddenly appeared and
 dropped the check on the table, which both women
stared at. Cordy was dumbfounded at what to do. Usually,
she always let the guy pay no matter who had asked who
but the same rules didn't really apply. She had done the
asking, after all but then Kate was the one who had
 chosen the restaurant. Cordy knew there really wasn't
 much of a point for this internal debate, considering
 that she only had a few dollars in her purse.</p>

<p>Kate seeing the confusion and slight panic in Cordy's
eyes, she reached over and picked up the check.
"Hey, I've got it this time." Kate said, as Cordy
breathed a sigh of relief. Then Kate's words really
sunk in. Would there be a next time?</p>

<p>After paying the check, Cordy and Kate walked out to
the car in silence both thinking about one thing as
the night pulled to a close: the goodnight kiss.
Cordy's heart seemed to hammer in her chest at the
 thought of kissing Kate. Did she want to kiss Kate?
There was really no question that she wanted to kiss
Kate very much. She wanted to kiss Kate so badly that
there was a dull ache in her heart when she thought
about it. Did Kate want to kiss her? Usually, Cordelia
was pretty good at reading people but she couldn't help
but feel clueless in this situation. Kate knew she really
wanted to kiss Cordy she wasn't sure if Cordy wanted to.
She wasn't sure what Cordy thought of her or their date.
Hell, Kate did not know what she thought about it herself.</p>

<p align=center>******</p>

<p>"So, " Cordy said as Kate pulled to a stop in front of
Cordelia's apartment building. Kate looked over at Cordy,
noting how cute she was when she was nervous. "I guess
this is goodnight."</p>

<p>"I guess so." Kate replied and Cordy felt her heart sink
slightly. Kate wasn't making any move to lean in to kiss
 her and Cordy bit her lip slightly. This was definitely
not the way she wanted the night to end. And Cordelia
Chase was used to getting what she wanted. Her desire to
kiss the woman across from her out weighed her total fear,
so leaning over to touch Kate's arm; she brought her other
 hand up to the blonde woman's face. Slowly she leaned in
 even further to press her lips to Kate's. Gently, Kate
 started to respond, kissing her back and tangling her
 hands in Cordy's soft hair. Cordelia took advantage of
 Kate's open mouth to explore it with her tongue.</p>

<p>The touch of their tongues together sent desire shooting
through both women. Kate moaned slightly and finally gave
 in to kiss totally, wrapping her arms around Cordy. The
 kiss grew passionate as Cordy returned the embrace. All
was lost in the daze of Kate's soft lips and arms. Before
 she could even realize it, Kate was pushing her away.</p>

<p>"What? Did I do something wrong?" Cordy asked as she
tried to catch her breath. Kate was breathing heavily
and had her eyes closed, like she was trying to get in
 control of her emotions. Cordy felt a kind fear that
was unfamiliar flow through her.</p>

<p>"No, " Kate answered with a sigh. She looked over at
Cordy and saw the fear in the other woman's eyes and
she shook her head. It wasn't like Cordelia thought,
it wasn't that Kate didn't want Cordy or that the kiss
they had just shared was not the most amazing thing ever.
"No, you did nothing wrong. It's just..."</p>

<p>"What?" Cordelia asked and Kate tried to gather her thoughts.</p>

<p>"Cordy, I can't be your phase." Kate finally said,
softly. Cordelia looked perplexed and Kate felt her
heart jump into her throat. How could she possibly
explain? "What I mean is that two days ago you didn't
 understand how I could be a lesbian and now hear we
are kissing, and we both know that wasn't a simple
goodnight kiss. It felt like a beginning."</p>

<p>"It is." Cordy softly insisted, trying to understand
what Kate was doing. The only thing that seemed to
make any sense was that seemed to ending this
before it began."</p>

<p>It can't be. I'm really happy that you've finally
admitted that you are attracted to women and that you've
begun exploring your sexuality. But I can't be involved
with you." Kate finished saying, hating the words but
knowing they were necessary and true. This date had been
amazing and what she felt for Cordelia wasn't simple,
and Kate knew that she could and would fall in love
with this woman.</p>

<p>"I don't understand. You don't want to be with me?"
Cordy said as tears filled her eyes. This was not how
it was supposed to go. They both felt it, so what was
 the problem?</p>

<p>"No, I do want to be with you. Cordy, I think that if
I were to be involved with you I would end up falling
in love with you. In fact, I think I've all ready started.
That kind of opens up a big opportunity for me to get hurt
and I couldn't take that. Everyone goes through phases and
Cordy, you are young and questioning which is good, but I am
 twenty-seven years old. I know what I want and that's not
going to change. What I fear is that what you want will change."
 Kate finally finished. </p>

<p>Cordy just looked at her as a tiny tear finally spilt
over her cheek. What Kate was saying was clear. Kate
was afraid that she would change her mind, or that this
was a phase she was in. Afraid that Cordelia would break her heart.
It was a familiar fear, one that Cordy had every time
she started a relationship but Cordy tried to no to let
stop her from feeling. Kate seemed to be frozen with
fear and Cordy knew if she didn't think of something to
say she would lose Kate forever. </p>

<p align=center>*******</p>

<p>"No, " Finally Cordelia managed to get that simple
word out. </p>

<p>Cordy stared at Kate, this amazing, beautiful woman
who had made her feel so much, all these emotions and
thoughts that Cordelia had spent her whole life trying
 to deny she had. She had buried them so deep inside
 but this one woman changed all that. Kate made Cordy
want to feel these things and experience them, and
although she was still scared as hell Cordy knew
it was worth. Cordelia wanted to be with Kate more
than she had ever wanted anything before. She just
didn't know how to tell Kate that.</p>

<p>"What I want won't change, " Cordy said quietly. </p>

<p>Kate looked at her and sighed."You say that now
but you don't know..."</p>

<p>"You're right, I don't know." Cordy suddenly interrupted Kate.
 "I don't know what's going to happen and neither do you.
You think I'm not scared? Kate, I don't think I've ever been
 so scared and I've seen some scary things in my life.
That won't go away and there can't be any guarantees,
but that's just the way it is. It doesn't change the
fact that I want to be with you!"</p>

<p>Kate closed her eyes, wanting to believe Cordelia
with all her heart but so afraid to. God, she wanted
to be with Cordy. She wanted to kiss her and hold her
and make love to her and never let go but was Kate
willing to take that risk, knowing that this young,
beautiful girl would have the power to tear her apart
if she wanted to. All her life, Kate had been taught
by her father not to show emotion, to keep yourself
tough and distant, and don't let your heart get the
better of you. </p>

<p>"I don't know how to not be afraid, how to give myself
the chance to be happy with you. It is just not how
 I'm made. I'm sorry, Cordy." Kate whispered as tears
came to her eyes.</p>

<p>She was starting to cry and couldn't stop herself,
even though she tried to never cry in front of others.
Cordy didn't say a word; she just wrapped her arms
around Kate and held her as silent tears ran down her
face. It was unlike anything Cordelia had ever experienced,
this raw emotion that seemed to be coursing through her.
Only one thing seemed to matter at this moment was Kate.</p>

<p>"Do you want to be with me?" Cordy asked softly as Kate
lifted her head and Kate nodded, not yet trusting her
voice to speak."Then that's the only thing that matters.
I know you're scared. I am too." Cordy said, taking
Kate's face in her hands and leaning close to her, to
get near her body's softness and warmth. "But, baby,
I would rather say I gave up my heart and had ripped
out of my chest then to say I never gave it to anyone."</p>

<p>Kate felt her resolve crumbling. What Cordelia said made
so much sense and she knew, in her heart, that it was the
truth. She wanted to fall in love with Cordelia, no matter
what might happen. She wanted to make herself vulnerable at
least this once because it was worth it. One look into Cordy's
eyes confirmed that fact and Kate leaned in very slowly and
brushed her lips across Cordy's. Years of trying to be tough
and not feel seemed so pointless now, all those times she
had pushed people away and not let herself see what was right
in front of her. She had always pretended she was completely
honest, yet deep down Kate had always been a liar. A liar
because she never admitted to the truths about herself and
her emotions.</p>

<p>As Kate kissed her very softly, Cordy's heart was singing
with joy as things started to make sense. When they had
started this, Cordelia had felt like the fearful, vulnerable
one, but these few moments in the car had proved otherwise.
Kate was just as scared and confused, as Cordy was, just as
unsure about her own heart. In was this moment that Cordy
really understood what was happening between them. This was
about two people who were both flawed and scared trying
because it is worth it to fall in love. This was not an
experiment or a trial run of this new sexuality but something
 deeper. Cordelia Chase was falling in love with Kate Lockley.</p>

<p>"Please, be with me tonight." Cordy whispered and
Kate nodded, knowing she was agreeing to more than
just a night. She had just told Cordy what had been
in her heart all along: they were meant to be
together and nothing, not even fear or uncertainty
could change that.</p>
