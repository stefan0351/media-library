<p>Willow brought her hands up to her eyes, and rubbed them again. Her fingers hurt from clicking for hours, and her ass didn’t feel much better. She had spent the last three hours looking up some such nonsense for Giles, and she ruefully thought why she even did these things anyway.</p>

<p>Because, her little voice told her, you want to help Buffy. . . any way you can. . .</p>

<p>She rubbed her hand through her hair, and scrolled down the page again. The computer screen blinked ominously at her, and she scowled. Usually, she could find anything on the Internet in less than 10 minutes, but this time, her quarry eluded her.</p>

<p>"Sure, Old dependable Willow, always staying behind and doing the dirty work."</p>

<p>She mumbled to herself. She rose from her chair, and grabbed her books off the shelf. Just as she was about to turn around and call it a night, her foot caught in the chair legs, and with a startled yelp, she dropped all her books on her keyboard, and fell to the floor.</p>

<p>"Oh, great. This is just great."</p>

<p>She said from her place in the floor. She untangled her feet from the chair, and sighed. "Just Face it Willow Rosenberg, you will never be graceful like. . ." Her thoughts trailed off, consumed by one name, one person. Buffy. . . "Alright Wills, get a grip. . ." Using her hands, she pushed herself up off the floor, and began gathering her books from on top of the keyboard. Thats when she noticed that somehow, the screen had changed. She sat down and read the words scrawling across the screen in bold pink and purple. "A chat site. . . I just stumbled on to a chat site. . . Chats are good. . . People can talk to one another. . . Nothing serious, or personal. . . Just people. . . Chatting . . ." Her curiosity getting the best of her, she clicked on the "18 to enter" logo, and waited to be let in the room. That’s when she noticed that this wasn’t an ordinary chat room.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>"You. . ." Crash. "Just. . . don’t. . ." Thud. "Know. . ." Pop. "When to give up!" Bang.</p>

<p>Buffy sucked in a breath, and brought her elbow up to the neck of the latest vampire she was fighting. This move effectively gave her the distance needed to grab the stake by her left foot, and plunge it into her victim. He then disappeared in a burst of dust, and she wiped her hands on her jeans. "Yeah, well, someone has to do it. . ." She straightened her jacket over her shoulders, and began to dust herself off. She ran her fingers through her hair in an attempt to straighten it, and she started walking home. She yawned quietly, and brought her hand up to her mouth.</p>

<p>Been a long day. . . She casually jumped the curb and crossed the street heading home. First I woke up late, and was late for class. Then Giles proceeded to keep me after class talking about something or other, and then there was Willow. Her thoughts took a distractive turn as she rounded the corner, and it was beginning to surprise her. She wore that cute little button down shirt again. It looks so good with her hair, and not to mention her bre. . . "Wait a minute here Buff. . ." Her thoughts had brought her to a complete stop and she shook her head trying in vain to clear it. "Time for a subject change. . ." She muttered to herself as she started walking again. Got to get started on that paper that was due last week. Don’t know how much longer I can hold out on that. Maybe I can get Wills to help me. She is good at that kind of stuff, well, she is good at everything she does. The Slayer smiled as she bounded up the walk to her front door. I love the way she smiles, it lights up her whole face, and that laugh. . . Buffy casually opened up the front door, and called out for her mother. After getting no response, she realized that she was gone for the rest of the week at some convention, and she would be home alone. She headed up the stairs, stripping all the way up, and headed straight for the shower.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>"You have got to be kidding me. . ." Willow said with a smirk as she read the words flying across the screen. She had been sitting here for the past hour just reading what the other occupants were saying, the pain in her backside long forgotten. She had become engrossed in a conversation by a person named freetail, and another person called Viper about the do’s and don’ts of fisting. Of course, the redhead had no idea what fisting was, but after a few more minutes of reading, she thought she had the gist. She thought that somewhere, being in a lesbian chat room should bother her, maybe tip her morals a little bit, but it didn’t. The fact that she still had morals after what she had seen and done was a feat in itself, and she figured that the live and let live philosophy was the way to go in this case. And you are enjoying yourself. . . and the conversation. She ruefully stated to herself. She yawned and looked at the clock. Better get to bed, have class tomorrow. She thought as she book marked the site with a quick click, and flipped of the screen. She casually went through the motions of getting ready for bed with a detached mind. I can’t wait to tell Buffy about this. . . Wait. . . I can’t tell her about this. . . She will think. . .well. . . I don’t know what she would think. . . But you can’t tell anyone. . . She flipped off the lights and walked to her bed, laid down and closed her eyes. Tomorrow you need to get Buffy to do that paper she has been neglecting, and maybe go stay with her for awhile. Joyce is out of town, and she might get lonely. . . Her thoughts of her best friend carried her into sleep.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>"Damn. . ." Buffy said as she heard the beeping of a busy signal in her ear. "Wonder who Wills is talking to this late." She said as she settled down in the bed. Could be anyone. Maybe Xander. . Yeah, its most likely Xander. . . They had that little thing in English they were paired up for. . . Or maybe its Cordelia. . . Nah . . Somehow, I really doubt that. . . It has to be Xander . . . Maybe its Oz. . . The blonde shuddered at the irrational stab of jealously that went through her at the though of her best friend talking with Oz so late at night. Even though the fledgling relationship didn’t work out, there was still something that kept them good friends. Buffy was amazed at how much this bothered her. The ringing of the phone startled her, and she grabbed the phone with a shaking hand.</p>

<p>"Wills?" She barked into the receiver. "Well, hello to you to." Said the distinctively male voice over the phone. "Xander. It’s late. You need something?" "Nope, I just wanted to see how the patrol went tonight. Anything interesting happen?" "No, just the same thing. Have you spoken to Willow tonight?" "No, I haven’t seen her since after school. And. . . Uh. . I was sorta on the phone with Cordy for awhile, so. . ." "Well, I was just wondering. See you tomorrow Xander. . . Night." "Night."</p>

<p>The slayer hung up the phone, and settled back down into bed. She looked at the clock and faintly wrestled with herself over trying Willow’s number again, but decided against it. She closed her eyes, and thought of her best friend until she slipped into a dreamless sleep.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>"Hey!! Why don’t you watch where you are going?" The redhead said to the swiftly retreating back of the person that knocked into her. "Some people are so rude. . ." She mumbled to herself, and kept walking through the halls. Her steps carried her to the outer door to the library, and she looked at her watch. This is was Cordiela dubbed a working lunch, where they would all meet in the library to do their briefing, also another word Cordiela came up with. She held her breath and listened through the door. Buffy’s voice came out at her, and she felt her heart rate increase, and her palms sweat. Oh just great. . . Now you are going to go in there with these goo goo eyes, and. . . The abrupt opening of the door she was leaning on interrupted her thoughts. Startled green eyes met brown.</p>

<p>"Buffy. . . I was just fixing to come in. . ."</p>

<p>Willow felt the familiar pain in her chest as the slayer favored her with one of her smiles. "That’s a good thing." The blonde said. "Because I was coming to look for you. What was going on last night." Buffy asked as she grabbed Willow ’s elbow and led her into the room. Willow shuddered at the sensation of the slayer’s hand warming her elbow, and she cleared her throat. "Oh, well, Giles had asked me to see what i could come up with on monsters on a lunar calendar on the Internet, and i guess that i just lost track of time. " Willow smiled one of those unsure, hesitant smiles and Buffy felt her heart start to pound, and she smiled back. "I guess that I can forgive you then. . ." The slayer said, as they sat down at the table where everyone was sitting.</p>

<p>Willow let her eyes travel around the room as the group talked. She took in how close Cordiela and Xander sat, and how they kept touching each other. Never thought that would work out. . . Stranger things have happened. She saw Giles, and the little beads of sweat that were popping up on his top lip, as what happens sometimes when he was extremely vemenient in whatever he was talking about. And then she drank in the sight of Buffy. The slayer was wearing a soft, pale blue sweater with black pants. The sweater was form fitting, and hugged her in all the right places. Buffy’s eyes were following Giles as he talked, and she noted the little smirk that her full lips curved into. Her brown eyes flicked back and forth watching the conversation, and her blonde hair was falling softly around her striking features. Willow sighed inwardly, and took a stock of what she was wearing. Her denim overalls were too big on her, and they hid her shape in a shroud of blue, and her white turtleneck underneath just hinted at her breasts. How can i even compare to her. . . She is so beautiful. . . A movement caught Willow’s eye, and she looked down to see Buffy’s thumb brush across the label of the bottled water she was drinking. Willow felt faint, but she couldn’t tear her eyes away from the sight of Buffy’s thumb rubbing back and forth collecting, and smearing the wet condensation across the side of the plastic. A loud boom startled her, and she looked up to see Giles glaring at her. "Willow. Didn’t you hear what I just said?" The impatient Watcher said to the redhead, and Willow took a deep breath. "I. . . I’m sorry. . .I guess that i am just not feeling well. . ." Willow gathered her books and made a beeline for the door. "Willow, where are you going?" The watcher asked as Willow clamored towards the door. "I. . . I don’t know. . ." She said as she tore out the door. Buffy stared at the space where just moments before her best friend occupied, and she stood up. "I am going to go check on her." And the slayer slipped out the door before anyone could protest.</p>

<p>Willow made her way to her locker, and she dumped her books unceremoniously inside, and leaned her head against the frame. What’s going on with me. . . I can’t think. . . I can’t sleep. . . I can’t eat. . . I can’t do anything but. . . Feel. She closed her eyes at the onslaught of tears that threatened to consume her. I feel so much, and i don’t even understand this. "Hey. . ." A soft touch on her shoulder, and the soft voice startled her and she jumped, hitting her head against the frame that she was leaning on, and the tears that threatened to spill over in frustration then spilled from pain. The redhead saw stars, and she grabbed her head. ""Wills? Are you alright?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, i just cracked my head open, but I am alright." The redhead said as she shut the locker and leaned against it heavily. The tears now ran down her cheeks, and she opened her eyes at the incredibly soft touch of the slayers fingers on her cheeks. She opened her eyes, seeing Buffy looking at her intensely, and then looking down at the wetness on her fingers. "I don’t think that these are for hitting your head. What’s wrong Wills?" Willow just sighed and tried to turn around, having a need to get away from that gaze reaching deep inside, and twisting her guts. This isn’t helping . . .</p>

<p>Buffy sighed at the sad look that passed over Willow’s face. "You can tell me, you are my best friend you know."</p>

<p>"Nothing. . . Its nothing. . . I just haven’t been feeling well lately, and i have so much to do, and things are just not going as planned. . ."</p>

<p>"I know that feeling." The slayer said with a smile. "Do you want to skip out of class and go home? I will go with you. . ."</p>

<p>"Buffy, you know that you can’t skip class, you miss so much already, and I just. . . Well. . . I can’t. . ."</p>

<p>"Alright, just take care of yourself. And why don’t you come to my house tonight after class. You can help me on my paper. . . please?" Willow couldn’t help but smile. "Yeah. . Sure. I will see you then." With a quick smile, they both went their separate ways, Buffy feeling better about Willow, and Willow feeling better about herself.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>The slayer pulled the chewed, pen tip from her mouth and frowned. "What do you mean this figure will not work. Wills, if x is the coefficient, then y would be equal to. . ."</p>

<p>"See that’s exactly it. X isn’t the coefficient. . ."</p>

<p>"Oh. Thanks."</p>

<p>"Your welcome." Willow said, and stretched out across Buffy’s bed, and sighed. She glanced at her watch, and noted the time. She felt a gaze burn across her, and she looked up in time to see Buffy watching her intently before the slayers brown eyes flicked back to her math book. Wishful thinking Willow. . . She thought to herself, as she sat up and stretched her legs out in front of her. She studied her shoes, and stifled a yawn.</p>

<p>"Hey, you look tired." Came from the slayer who was now flopping herself across the bed. "Yeah, I am, and its not even nighttime yet. I guess that i just haven’t been sleeping well lately or something."</p>

<p>"Humm. You should take better care of yourself. Maybe you should go on home and call it a night, i have to go out tonight anyway. . "</p>

<p>"Yeah, maybe i can get some extra sleep. I am glad that tomorrows Friday though. Even if we will be out all weekend." Willow grinned, and impulsively leaned up against her best friend.</p>

<p>This was a action that she immediately regretted, when the slayer put her arm around her shoulders, and laid her cheek against her other shoulder. The move had seemed so natural, like they had been doing it for years, and just couldn’t help it. They both were frozen, too afraid to move. Willow could feel Buffys breathing, and smell her warm, inviting sent. Buffy was lost in a haze of emotion that she didn’t understand, and was unwilling to let go. A sudden tightness filled her chest, and she found it hard to breathe. They seemed to move as one, looking deep into each other’s eyes. Hearts were pounding, Blood was rushing, they were breathing the same air. Green drowning in brown, dissolving all the barriers. . .</p>

<p>RING. . . RING. . .</p>

<p>The shrill ringing of the phone startled them, and they jumped apart. Willow jumped up and grabbed her bag.</p>

<p>"Wait! Don’t leave Willow. . ." Buffy left the phone ringing and started after her friend. She could see the brush of tears filling her eyes, and she reached out to her best friend. "Wills. . ."</p>

<p>"Don’t. . . I. . . I have to go. . ." And the redhead rushed out the door. Buffy sat back down on the bed, and reached for the phone. The pleasant pain in her chest had turned hateful, and she cleared her throat trying to rid herself of the lump that had formed there while reaching for the still ringing phone.</p>

<p>"Hello. . ." She didn’t even recognize her own voice, it sounded so small and frail. She winced as she heard the slamming of the door, and knew that Willow was walking out. . . "Yeah mom, I’m fine. . ."</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Willow slammed her bedroom door, and flung herself across her bed. The tears that she had held in check came pouring out from her eyes, and somewhere in her mind, she flamed herself for being so emotional lately. I don’t understand this. . . Its just to intense. . . Willow sighed and flopped over onto her back. Why I am crying all the time. . . Allowing herself some cogitation, she abruptly sat up on the bed, and angrily wiped her tears. "All right Willow, lets get it together. You have handled lots of other things, you can handle a little. . . Uh. . . Little. . . " Its more than a crush, so. . . "Thing. . . This little thing." She nodded her head, and stood up, heading over to her computer. "I need to work, get my mind off of things. . ." She quickly sat down, and booted up her computer. The redhead then brought up her files from her search last night, and began looking again. After about an hour of searching and printing all of the information, she felt better, grounded. She was fixing to get off, when she remembered her chat site bookmark, and she clicked on it just for fun.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p><p>"Jesus Buff. . . What’s with you today?" Faith wiped her brow on her sleeve, and eyed her fellow slayer. She watched as the blonde ripped the boxing gloves from her hands, and threw them down on the floor. "</p>

<p>Nothing, its nothing. . . Just some. . . extra tension i guess."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I guess. You look like hell."</p>

<p>"Ha. . ." The blonde laughed, " I feel like hell. I don’t know what’s going on with me."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe you should take it easy or something." Faith tententivly smiled at her newfound friend. Buffy just looked around the room. She had pushed the furniture around in the living room of her own house to give them room, and then invited Faith over to drill. For some reason, she just didn’t feel like going out. She searched herself inside, and found that the only thing she wanted to do was kick some ass. She laughed at herself, and Faith looked at her long and hard. Buffy raised her eyes to the other slayers and smiled.</p>

<p>"Come on. . . Lets go patrol or something."</p>

<p>Faith smiled back at her. "Sure, but leave some for me. . ."</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Willow’s fingers flew across her keyboard as she typed in her reply. She never intended to actually chat, just to watch. But soon after she started reading, she found herself making up a profile, and a screen name that was nothing like her at all. Deciding that it never hurt anyone to be different sometimes, she went with her gut, and now here she was. Being the genius that she was, picking up on the conversations weren’t hard for her, and pretty soon, she was chatting like a pro in the hottest lesbian chat room on the Internet. For some reason, that thought struck her as funny, and she laughed, feeling better than she had for a long time. She quickly read the screen, and typed in another reply. She was enjoying this casual banter, choosing to ignore all the requests to go "private". She carefully read her reply before sending it, and had to giggle at her own screen name. Raven . . . how’s that for being different. She grinned, and started to reply to yet another post coming her way. Willow the wallflower wasn’t a wallflower in cyber space, and that made her feel good, made her feel important. Important, that sure is nice. . .</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p><p>Buffy pulled the damp towel from her wet tresses, and combed through them. She then picked up her usual sleeping attire of shorts and a men’s undershirt, and reached for the phone. She carefully dialed her best friends number, and sighed when she replaced it in the cradle. Busy. , . Her phone is always busy. . . She lay down across her bed, but couldn’t sleep. She turned her thoughts to her latest patrolling adventure with Faith, but that didn’t hold her interest for long. Her disobedient mind began to wonder to that afternoon, when Willow had been so close. Those slightly parted, pink lips, inches from her own. The blonde threw her pillow up in the air in exasperation, and stormed up off the bed. She plugged in a c.d., and turned it up loud enough so she could hear it in the other room. Willow is most likely on the net. . . And i am going to find her, and make her talk to me. I can fight demons, and vampires, but i can’ t fight this. . . She pulled out the chair that faced her mother’s computer, and she logged on. After spending many moments trying to figure out how to actually do a search, she tried to locate her friend. With no luck, she decided to give up. She reached up to turn the lamp off, and she brushed the keyboard with her hands. When she sat back down to log off, she noticed the screen had changed. Across the screen, in bold purples and pinks, the word "Chat" came out at her. Ah, what the hell. . . What else are you going to do. . . And she clicked the "18 to enter" button.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>"Ah, fresh blood. . ." Willow said to herself as she sent a greeting to the new girl in the chat room. "Might as well be the welcome wagon." She mumbled and waited for a response from this "Jess" person. She answered a few more posts before finally getting the reply from Jess. It was simple, and nice. Jess was explaining that she had never been in a chat room before, and that she was wanting someone to show her around, Willow jumped at the chance. She had no idea why she had done it, but it was done, and before she knew it, Raven had sent Jess an invite to a private chat. "There is a first time for everything . . ." The red head said to herself and began chatting with Jess. The conversation mostly consisted of computer talk, and Willow found herself really enjoying talking with this girl. Sometimes, a phrase would catch her off guard, and she would scramble her brain to try to figure out where she had heard it before. The light banter was just what she needed, and she began to really talk to the girl. They chatted for hours, deep into the night, about anything, everything and nothing at all. And then suddenly, the conversation changed.</p>

<p>I have a question for you~~ Sent by Jess <BR>What?~~ Sent by Raven</p>

<p>How long have you, well, been into girls~~ Sent by Jess</p>

<p>Damn, Blunt thing isn’t she. Willow sighed and debated with herself on weather or not to lie or tell the truth. She sighed and decided on the later, knowing that she was never a successful liar.</p>

<p>Actually, I just realized it. I have never been with a girl. I just started having feelings for my best friend lately, and I figured the best place to research it would be here. What about you?~~ Sent by Raven</p>

<p>Willow sighed and waited for the response. She actually felt nervous while waiting for the response. </p>

<p>That’s interesting, I am in a similar situation. The same actually. Why don’t you go for it?~~ Sent by Jess</p>

<p>We are so different. She is so beautiful, and popular, and, well, lots of things, and I am just me. Unimportant me. I guess that’s why.~~ Sent by Raven</p>

<p>I am sure that’s not a fair description of yourself.~~ Sent by Jess</p>

<p>Maybe, anyway, I could ask you the same question, why don’t you just go for it?~~ Sent by Raven</p>

<p>To be totally honest, I am scared. There are some things in my life that aren’ t, well, normal, and I know she accepts them, but I don’t think she really knows. And she doesn’t feel like she is real part of my life. ~~ Sent by Jess</p>

<p>Sounds to me like all you need to do is just to try to make her feel like she is really a part of things.~~ Sent by Raven</p>

<p>That is a good idea, but i will have to think about it. And as for you, if you want to get noticed, then do something that will get you noticed.~~ Sent by Jess</p>

<p>And you have to remember, that if she accepts you for what you are, then that’s half the battle right there.~~ Sent by Raven</p>

<p>Thanks, that’s good advice. I better go, i have go get up soon.~~ Sent by Jess</p>

<p>Yeah, me too, nice talking to you. Night.~~ Sent by Raven</p>

<p>Bye!!~~ Sent by Jess</p>

<p>Willow sighed and crawled into her bed. It had felt good to talk about Buffy with someone that understood. She had a plan beginning to form in her mind, and she couldn’t believe that she was actually going to do it. Her thoughts took her into a dreamless sleep. Meanwhile, Buffy pulled the covers up over her body and relaxed into the sheets. Make her feel important. . . That’s it. . . The slayer smiled as she formed her plan, and gently slid into sleep.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>"What do you mean you need my help. Wills, I think that you are beyond even my help." "Oh thanks so much Cordiela, next time I will just hand you my feelings so you will not have to rip them out." Willow said with her hands on her hips. The hall was filled with people walking on either side of them, and she winced as the two minute warning bell rang.</p>

<p>"Alright, fine. I will help you. But first, you have to answer me this question."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Ya got any money?"</p>

<p>The red head just nodded her answer towards the already leaving Cordiela.</p>

<p>"Good, meet me here, after school, we are going shopping." Cordiela said as she slipped off down the hall.</p>

<p>"Great, shopping. . ." Willow mumbled to herself as she headed towards class.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>On the other side of the school, Buffy slid in between the last minute stragglers, and made her way to her best friend’s locker. She quickly opened it up, and slid something inside. She shut the door and stated off down the hall. She smiled to herself as she rounded the corner. If that doesn’t work, i don’t know what will.</p>

<p>Willow sighed and looked at the clock. She still had three minutes until time for school to end, and she reached down into the pocket of her jeans and pulled out her cash. She counted it quickly, and placed it back in her pocket. Forty-three dollars and fifteen cents. That will just have to do. Her thoughts were interrupted by a persestented sound from her left. "Hey. . . Willow. . . Wills. . . Dammit, turn around here and talk to me." Willow sighed and turned around. "Xander, what do you want." "Yes, well, nice to speak to you too. You haven’t said three words to me all week. I was just wondering what was up." Willow sighed and turned her whole body around to face her friend. "Sorry Xander, I just have been really. . . Busy, yeah. . . Busy lately." "Yes, and you are running out of libraries, and going shopping with my girlfriend because. . ." Willow just stared at the man behind her with wide eyes. Xander just smirked and said, "Well, I was just curious. You are acting funny." "Nothing, and i am not acting funny. Why would there be anything wrong with me going shopping with Cordiela, and maybe. . . Just maybe i have allergies or something, and I had to leave in a hurry. . . And maybe. . . Well. . . You should just mind your own. . . Umm. . . Business." Willow turned around in her chair and faced the front. She could hear Xander’s sigh from behind her. "I was just. . ." The bell rang and interrupted his apology, and Willow slipped out of her chair just in time to hear him say, "worried about you."</p>

<p>"Hey, Buffy. Quit pacing. You are driving me insane." The blonde slayer smiled, and flopped down on the hard floor of the library. "Sorry Faith." "Why in the hell are you so damned. . . Nervous. . . Or something. Need to work off that energy?" Buffy looked up stunned to find Faith handing her a pair of gloves. Her face turned crimson. "Oh, I am so sorry. I thought you meant. . . Well. . . Something else." "Who says i didn’t?" Replied Faith with an impish grin. Buffy was stunned, and it showed. Her mouth dropped open, and she began to rub her palms on her pants. "Geeze, Buff. . . Sorry. I was joking all right? I didn’t know that would offend you." Buffy put her hands in the air to indicate that she wanted to speak. "Are you telling me that you. . . Like me? Or I think a better question is. . . You like. . . umm. . .</p>

<p>"Girls?" Faith finished for her.</p>

<p>"Yeah. . . Girls." Buffy repeated.</p>

<p>"Does that freak you out?" The brunette repiled.</p>

<p>"No." Buffy said a little to quickly.</p>

<p>"I knew I was right about you. From the first time I saw you look at Wills. . <BR>." "Wait." Buffy spun around. "What do you mean see me look at Wills."</p>

<p>"Well, you two just. . . Click." Faith replied. She grinned at the uninhibited smile that crept up in her fellow slayers already red face.</p>

<p>"Really?" Buffy said.</p>

<p>"Yeah. I knew you two had a thing.. ." Faith stopped her talking when she saw the blonde’s face fall. "I. . . I mean. . . you two don’t have a thing?"</p>

<p>"No. Willow doesn’t even know. I think it would freak her out, so. . ."</p>

<p>No, Buff. I have seen her look back at you with the same look."</p>

<p>"No, I was just imagining that. I talk to a friend last night on the Internet, and she said that I needed to make Willow feel important."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is important, but you also have to let her know you are interested."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Buffy said, stretching her arms and bouncing.</p>

<p>"Put on those gloves, and lets get busy, and then my friend. I am going to teach you everything I know." Buffy smiled and drew the padded gloves over her hands. This is going to be interesting . . .</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>"Can anyone say eeww?" Cordeila said as she picked up a shirt off of a clearance rack that Willow was looking at. Willow just scowled, as she put it back down. They had spent almost an hour of the red head finding something she liked, and the self styled queen of fashion dissing it instantly. Willow was tired of this. "Alright Cordiela. Why don’t you pick me out something." "Thought you would never ask. Come on." Willow groaned and followed Cordeila to the other side of the store. Almost instantly, Cordiela had pushed her into a dressing room, and was throwing clothes over the top to her. Willow just hated most of the clothing. She felt like a child dressing up in her mother’s closet. "Cordiela . . . We are going to have to try something else. . . This isn’t. . ." She stopped as another outfit was thrown over the door. "Here, try this one... I think its something you would like, and it’s the look you are going for." Willow lifted the clothes off of the door and held her breath. The pants were black, and they had the appearance of leather. She brought them up to her nose and sniffed. They were leather all right. She quickly drew them over her legs and actually liked the way that they felt, and looked. They were tight, that was something that she liked. They hugged her in all the right places, and she had to admit. She didn’t look that bad. She looked up to see something green being flung her way, and she grabbed the green shirt and pulled it on. She noted that the shirt ended just below her breasts, and was also skin-tight. The sleeves were long, and they bunched up nicely at the end of her wrists. She turned around, and liked what she saw. She looked dangerous, a force to reckon with. That’s what she wanted. "Well, come on Wills, Let me see." Willow opened the door and Cordeila smiled. "I think we have found what you have been looking for." Willow smiled and then looked at the price tag. Her face fell. She turned around to take it back off, and flung it over the door. Cordiela grabbed the clothes off of the door and walked off. The redhead pulled her clothes back on, and frowned, as she looked at her self in the mirror. She opened the door and almost walked right into Cordiela, holding a bag and her hand out.</p>

<p>"Give me your forty dollars Wills."</p>

<p>"Cordy, I don’t have enough for that. . ."</p>

<p>"Shush, I put it on my card. No one will notice, I shop here enough. So give me your forty dollars, and i will give you this bag."</p>

<p>Willow smiled and drew her money out of her pockets. "Don’t let anyone tell you this Cordy," Willow said as they made the exchange. "But you really are a good friend."</p>

<p>"Ha, don’t get postal on me now Wills." Cordiela said with a smile. "Now, let’ s get you over to my house, and you can borrow some of my shoes to go with that outfit." Willow smiled and decided that maybe Cordiela wasn’t as shallow as she thought.</p>

<p>Buffy walked around the corner, and stopped. "My spider sense is tingling. . ." She muttered to herself as she flung her elbow backwards, and smashed into the vamp behind her. There were four of them, and she smiled. "Gotta love those odds." She muttered before launching into a series of kicks and punches. She drew her stake out of her jacket pocket, and took care of the one behind her. Two others fell just as quickly, but the last one was proving to be something of a problem. She threw a punch to his face, and he dodged, and knocked her into the ground. She slid a few feet, and felt a burning sensation across her head. She ran her hands across the back of her head, and pulled back crimson. This pissed her off. She jumped up and surprised the vamp. After a complex series of punches, she finished with a roundhouse kick, and them stuck him. She watched his disappear into nothing as she smiled. "That’s for messing up my hair." Buffy said as she walked off.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>The Bronze was packed when Buffy walked in, and headed to the bathroom. She knew the back of her head was just a scratch, but she needed to wash it off, and brush the evidence out of her hair. She spotted Xander, Cordy, and Faith over on their usual couch, and was unnerved to not see Willow anywhere. She quietly slipped into the bathroom, and ran warm water over a paper towel. She rung it out, and brought it to the back of her head. Just then the door opened, and what she saw stunned her. She couldn’t think, she couldn’t speak. Willow just stood there, staring back at the slayer. Buffy's eyes raked down the length of the red heads body, taking in the skintight clothing, the way the color of the shirt brought out her eyes, and that hair. Buffy sucked in a ragged breath, and wondered where Willow had been hiding a body like that. Buffy felt herself turn to jelly, and her arm slipped down from the back of her head, and the towel fluttered forgotten to the floor. Willow watched it fall, and gasped.</p>

<p>"Buffy, what happened?"</p>

<p>Willow walked towards her best friend, and touched her hand that had made its way back up to the back of her head. "Oh, its nothing. I just had a little accident." Buffy shuddered as she felt Willow’s soft hands probing her head. Willow stepped around the back of her friend, and used a clean towel to clean the area. "It’s not as bad as it looks Buffy. Head wounds always bleed a lot, but still, you need to be careful." Buffy closed her eyes as the sensation of Willows breath caressed her ear. "Thanks." She managed to choke out. "I am always careful."</p>

<p>Willow touched the back of Buffy’s neck, and sighed. The skin was so soft, and her fingers just glided across it. This was quickly growing out of control, and she didn’t care anymore. Willow threw caution to the wind, and brought her fingers around to touch Buffy’s cheek. She felt the slayer shudder, and lean heavily against her. Willow whimpered at the sensation leaning fully against her, allowing her to see her venerability. The red head ran her fingers across Buffy’s face, tracing the closed eyes, the soft cheeks, and shaped nose. Finally, her fingers slid across the slayers full bottom lip, and she sucked in her breaths raggedly. The pink tinted skin was soft against her fingers, and she felt the heat from Buffy’s breaths. Buffy snapped her head up, and turned around. She faced the stunned Willow and looked deep into her eyes.</p>

<p>"I want to kiss you Wills." The slayer said breathlessly.</p>

<p>"I wish you would."</p>

<p>Willow replied, and watched as Buffy’s eyes went to her lips. She saw the blonde head lean towards hers, and she closed her eyes. The first touch was tentative, a slight brushing of lips. It quickly escalated into a raging inferno that neither could control. Timid tongues met and brushed carefully, each not wanting to push the other to far, but both wanting the same thing. Willow wrapped her arms around Buffy, and pulled her closer, dominating the kiss. Buffy let her, willingly allowing someone else to be in control of her for awhile. They finally broke apart for air, and crashed together again. Youthful passion and exuberance taking the lead this time, and leaving them both light headed. Willow rested her forehead against Buffys. "Wow." Was all she said. Buffy replied with a smile. Faith shut the bathroom door and kept everyone from walking in. You should pat yourself on the back kiddo. . . The brunette slayer said to herself, and smiled.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>"Hi."</p>

<p>"Hey."</p>

<p>Willow smiled, and looked down at her shoes. Buffy held the door open for Willow to walk in. The red head stepped in and she shoved her hands in her pockets to keep them from shaking. "I rented some movies on Mom’s card. I didn ’t know what you would want to see, so I just got 5 different ones." Buffy knew she was rambling, but she couldn’t help it. Here was Willow, the most beautiful creature in creation according to herself, going to stay the night. She was nervous.</p>

<p>"I don’t think that we will have time to watch 5 different movies Buffy." Willow grinned.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled at the red head, and then found herself staring. Her own breathing broke her out of her revelry, and she ran her fingers through her blonde hair. "Let me get that bag, and take it upstairs." Willow watched as Buffy picked up her overnight bag, and followed her best friend up the stairs. She had been up here lots of times, many times, but something about being in the slayers room now was different, and more than just a little bit scary. The red head was only half listening to the slayers talking, nodding when she deemed nesscary, and adding little "uh huh" every now and then. She was consumed with the intensity of what she was feeling. She was surrounded by everything that Buffy loved. It awed her that she was going to be part of that. They were standing close to eachother, Willow could smell the blondes shampoo, and that sent that she always had about her. It filled her senses, until there was nothing left. Buffy was consumed at how the streaming sunlight would catch the red hair, and how it would shine, and make Willow’s eyes glow. Buffy stopped talking. Willow stopped breathing. They just stared at eachother.</p>

<p>It seems like an eternity, standing there, both knowing what they wanted, but to afraid to even move. Buffy took the first move, smiling she said "Willow, I wish that you would just kiss me. . ." The red head needed no more prompting, as she carefully lowered her lips to Buffy’s. They were both stunned at the need that just this simple kiss created. Tongues touched, and Willow thought for sure that she was dying. They broke apart, and stared again. Willow looked down at her feet, but Buffy’s strong hand caught her chin and pulled her eyes up again. Green eyes were quickly filling with tears, and Buffy melted at the sight.</p>

<p>"Why are you crying?" She asked, hoping for the answer that she wanted to hear.</p>

<p>"I. . . I love you Buffy." The redhead said before pulling the slayer to her, and hugging her tightly.</p>

<p>Buffy allowed this to take place, rejoicing inside. She felt like dancing, like running up and down the street a thousand times screaming, But all she did was whisper, "I love you too Willow."</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Buffy didn’t remember how she had gotten on the bed, nor did she care. All she knew was that Willow was ravishing her. She closed her eyes as she felt her best friend’s lips upon her neck. She ran her hands along Willow’s back, desperate to touch skin, but too afraid. Willow was not afraid at all however. She was quickly dominating the experience, and Buffy surrendered control to someone else. Something that good Slayers never did, but something they all needed. She then sent up praises to any force that was listening for bringing Willow into her life, for letting her have someone to take care of her once and awhile. She drew in a quick breath as she felt Willow’s hands run up her shirt, and brush against her skin. Hot, white flames leapt from the redhead’s fingers, and shot straight to the slayer’s center. She groaned as Willow kissed her ears, her eyes, her nose, leaving no patch of skin without special treatment.</p>

<p>"Willow. . . Oh god. . . wait. . ." Willow sat up and stared with a dazed look in her eyes, that was quickly replaced with fear. "Oh, god Buffy, I am sorry. . . i guess that i just. . uh. . got carried away or something." Buffy smiled a placed a finger on the red heads lips. "Shh. . . I just wanted to get these clothes off of you."</p>

<p>Willow then smiled, and kissed the finger pressed to her lips. She was feeling adventurous, and she kept remembering all those conversations she had read in that chat room, so she gently drew the slayer’s finger into her mouth, and sucked on it. She felt Buffy’s intake of breath, and the watched as her eyes rolled back into her head.</p>

<p>"God Wills, you are killing me. . ."</p>

<p>Willow released the slayer’s finger, ran her fingers underneath the slayers shirt, and gently drew it up, exposing her rippling stomach. She gently traced the scars there, and her eyes turned sad. Buffy watched the expression of sadness enter Willow’s eyes, and when the red head gently bent her head to kiss the scars, Buffy felt like she could weep from the sheer sweetness and love in that simple act. As Willow’s lips touched her skin, another feeling took over completely, and she sighed. <BR> "That’s it. . ." She mumbled, using her superior strength to roll Willow over, and ended up on top of her. Buffy planted a searing, wet kiss on her best friend’s mouth, and got up. Willow actually whimpered at the loss of contact. Her interest was renewed as Buffy then slid the shirt off of her body, and undressed herself completely. Willow couldn’t breath. Buffy’s body was amazing. Hard and yet soft. She sat up and ran her fingers lightly over the skin of that stomach, and then down to her thighs.</p>

<p>"God. . ." Came from the slayers mouth, as she felt the hands caress her. Buffy opened her eyes, and grinned, grabbing Willows hands, pulling her up and starting with the buttons of her clothes. "Now its your turn." Willow didn’t say anything, and kept her hands at her side as she watched the slayer hastily undress her. She blushed at the expression that crossed the blonde’s face.</p>

<p>"My god Willow. . . How can you hide something this . . this… beautiful?", said the stunned slayer.</p>

<p>Willow was a picture of feminine perfection, soft curves and creamy white skin. She then pulled the red head against her, and they both sighed at the sensation of skin on skin. Lips then possessed, and they were no longer two entities. Timid touches and small kisses led to something neither of them could believe. They both had no idea what they were doing, but they knew that they liked it.</p>

<p>"I. . I want to touch you." Willow said looking at Buffy with timid eyes.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled, and led Willow's hands to her very center of her being. Willow felt her fingers swim in the warmth that she had created. She felt a sense of power unfold inside her, knowing that she created this kind of response in someone as amazing as Buffy. She slid her fingers around in the softness until she gently passed over a small bundle of hot flesh. She paused as Buffy moaned out, and spread her legs wider. Willow felt a grin tug at the sides of her mouth as she passed over it again, and got the same response. She added more pressure, and rubbed it in a circular motion, until the slayer was writhing, and mumbling incoherently.</p>

<p>Willow then recalled something else she read, and she brought her lips down to Buffy’s breast. She kissed the hardening peak, gently sucking it in her mouth. Immediately, she knew she had done something right, as she felt Buffy’s strong hands grasp her head and press down, wanting more contact. "God. . ." She breathed as sensations flooded her being. Willow gently sucked the nipple deeper inside her mouth and felt Buffy begin to shudder. Willow knew that something was happening, and she wanted to see the slayer’s face. She withdrew her mouth from the blonde’s breast, and increased the speed of her fingers. She watched the slayer’s eyes droop shut, and her mouth opened. Willow felt the body under hers tense up, and she knew it was time.</p>

<p>She watched as Buffy fell from herself. She heard the slayer scream her name, and blindly grasp the sheets underneath her. It was the most beautiful thing that Willow Rosenberg had ever seen. She ceased her movements, and wrapped her body around the slayers, and waited for her to return from the place that she herself had sent her.</p>

<p>"Oh gods. . . Willow. . You are. . Amazing."</p>

<p>Willow smiled against the skin of Buffy’s throat. "Thanks." she said timidly.</p>

<p>"Let’s see if i can return the favor." said Buffy with a mischievous smile.</p>

<p>"Hey, where you two all weekend?" Xander said, adjusting his bag to his other shoulder, so he could wrap his free arm around Cordiela. Buffy smiled, and Willow blushed.</p>

<p>"We were just working on some projects. . . For Giles." Buffy held her breath, and then relaxed when she saw that they bought it.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah.. That sounds like fun." Cordiela said under her breath.</p>

<p>"Well, we better get to the library, it’s been quiet around hellmouth lately, and i just know that everything is just gonna blow up one of these days." The slayer said, as she threw her stuff in her locker, and leaned up against Willow’ s shoulder. This innocent touching went unnoticed by their friends, but Willow started to smile, beam actually, and Buffy felt herself growing warm. Just then, Giles rounded the corner heading straight for them.</p>

<p>"Uh oh.. . Looks like trouble in paradise." "Buffy, I have been looking all over for you." "Sorry Giles, I was taking care of some stuff." "Well now, maybe I might be able to get you to take a break from all of that other important stuff and get you back to slaying." "Yeah, sure, we were just heading that way." "Well, we are nearing the end of the lunar cycle, and that means. . ." The Englishman’s speech was interrupted by both Buffy and Willow.</p>

<p>"Trouble.. . We know."</p>

<p>Giles walked ahead of them, and Buffy and Willow took up the rear. Buffy gently reached down and grasped Willow’s hand, and gave it a tight squeeze. Just then, all the electricity went out, and the only light came from the windows. It was still a good three hours before dusk, but something about this had demon written all over it. The slayer blew out a breath, and looked at Willow.</p>

<p>"Well, everything is back to normal now."</p>

<p>"I guess. . ." And they walked on down the hall in the darkness, each supporting a knowing smile.</p>
