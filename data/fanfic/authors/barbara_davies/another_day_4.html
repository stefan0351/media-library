<!-- Another Day In The Life (aka How Gabrielle Got Her Pink Nighty) \ Dealing With The Mail -->

<p>"Ooh. He not going to like <i>that</i>!"</p>
		<p>"No he isn't, is he?" Xena laughs.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Xena, Gabrielle and Argo are strolling towards a village that is identical to Laurel in every way ... and just as deserted. They have to part to make it past a large and deep pothole.</p>
		<p>Xena says, "Light or dark hair?"</p>
		<p>"Dark."</p>
		<p>"Fat?" </p>
		<p>"No<i>.</i> Buff." </p>
		<p>"Hmmm. Cyane?"</p>
		<p>"I don't know any Cyane."</p>
		<p>Xena looks sheepish. "Oh, yeah, sorry. Wrong tribe. ... That's interesting."</p>
		<p>"No it isn't. Kalmia is just like Laurel ... only with potholes."</p>
		<p>"That's what I meant."</p>
		<p>"Oh."</p>
		<p>At the sound of their voices, a slender woman emerges from one of the houses. Her anxious look changes to one of amazement when she sees Gabrielle.</p>
		<p>"Oh! You're... You're ... you're Gabrielle, aren't you?" </p>
		<p>Gabrielle: "Yes." </p>
		<p>"All <i>right!</i> I finally get to meet the bard of Potadeia herself." She strikes a pose and declaims: "Roses are red, violets are blue. But I never thought, I'd ever meet you." </p>
		<p>Gabrielle gapes at the strange woman, speechless.</p>
		<p>The woman laughs excitedly, "Nothing like a spot of improv., is there, Gabrielle? Hey, maybe while you're here you could look at some of the poems and stories I've written and tell me what you think?"</p>
		<p>"Er, I suppose I could," manages Gabrielle.</p>
		<p>"I've read all your scrolls. About how you tamed the warrior princess," the woman gives Xena a dismissive glance, "controlled the Titans, won the 'best bard' award at the Athens Academy ... "</p>
		<p>Gabrielle sighs. "Listen, we're just here to ..."</p>
		<p>"... and I have to tell you ... I loved them all!" She strikes another pose: "I think that I shall never see, a bard as talented as thee." </p>
		<p>While Gabrielle is still trying to come to terms with this extravagant flattery, the woman resumes her normal manner and addresses Xena. "So, what's it like to travel with the hottest bard in Greece?" She doesn't wait for a reply. "Does she tell you bedtime stories?"</p>
		<p>"Well, as a matter of fact -"</p>
		<p>"Hey!" says Gabrielle indignantly.</p>
		<p>Xena blinks at Gabrielle, then turns to the woman. "Farris told us about your little problem, erm -</p>
		<p>"Rheta," supplies the woman.</p>
		<p>"Rheta. Have the other villagers left already?"</p>
		<p>Rheta nods. "They headed for the hills an hour ago. Where's Farris?" She smiles at Gabrielle. "He's my boyfriend, you know. He likes your stories too, but <i>I'm</i> your number one fan."</p>
		<p>"He's running an errand for m- for Gabrielle," says Xena, earning herself a wry glance from Gabrielle. She shrugs as if to say, "Well."</p>
		<p>Rheta nods approvingly. "I want you to know ... I'm ready to help out in any way I can. I'm really good at rhymes. And my sewing has won awards - I'm on my toes with buttons and bows." </p>
		<p>Xena and Gabrielle exchange glances.</p>
		<p>"Erm, thank you, Rheta," says Xena unconvincingly.</p>
		<p>"So," says Rheta to both of them. "What's your plan? You killed Gareth, didn't you?" She turns to Gabrielle. "Can't wait for you to publish the scroll about that one." She turns back to Xena again. "You going to do the same thing to Griffith?"</p>
		<p>Xena shrugs. "I don't know yet." Gabrielle gapes at her. "Well I don't. I've got a few ideas though ..."</p>
		<p>Rheta: "No problem. What can I do to help?"</p>
		<p>Xena glances slyly at Gabrielle. "Well I always think best when I'm relaxed, don't you, Gabrielle?"</p>
