<!-- Another Day In The Life (aka How Gabrielle Got Her Pink Nighty) \ Personal Hygiene -->

<p>Gabrielle and Xena are in a tub together. A rubber duck and a frog are bobbing up and down on the soapy water. Gabrielle is washing Xena's back with a sponge. They are both wearing strange looking pink bath caps.</p>
		<p>Xena says, "Do we <i>have</i> to wear these stupid things?" She gestures at the caps.</p>
		<p>"Rheta made them herself," said Gabrielle. "Do you want to hurt her feelings?"</p>
		<p>Xena smirks.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle sighs. "Don't answer that."</p>
		<p>Xena shrugs and changes the subject: "Eponin?"</p>
		<p>"No."</p>
		<p>"Hmmm. ... No, don't tell me."</p>
		<p>Rheta calls from outside the door, "Is everything all right, Gabrielle? Water hot enough?"</p>
		<p>"It's fine, Rheta," calls Gabrielle.</p>
		<p>"She's a bit strange, isn't she?," says Xena. "What's with all this rhyming stuff?" She imitates Rheta and chants in a singsong voice: "There once was a woman from Kalmia, who was getting progressively barmier -"</p>
		<p>"Be nice!" chides Gabrielle. Xena subsides grumbling. </p>
		<p>"So. What are we going to do about Griffith?" Gabrielle soaps Xena's back some more.</p>
		<p>Xena: "I don't know, it hasn't hit me yet."</p>
		<p>"Well, I've already asked Rheta to collect materials so you can construct another flying parchment, and to round up some mirrors." </p>
		<p>Xena frowns. "You have?"</p>
		<p>"I missed the weather forecast, so I thought it best to cover all eventualities."</p>
		<p>"That wasn't what I meant. Been there, done that, Gabrielle." </p>
		<p>Gabrielle sighs. "What is it about you and originality, Xena?"</p>
		<p>"Guess it's the creative urge. After all, you don't like writing the same scroll over and over, do you?"</p>
		<p>"That's true. So, if you're not going to use the flying parchment or the mirrors, what <i>are</i> you going to do?"</p>
		<p>"I'm still thinking about that. Flexibility, Gabrielle. Remember?"</p>
		<p>The bard sighs. "I remember."</p>
		<p>"Here now, I'll do <i>your</i> back." They switch places and Xena starts to soap Gabrielle's back. </p>
		<p>"Anything I can get you two," calls Rheta.</p>
		<p>"No thanks, we're fine," calls Gabrielle.</p>
		<p>Xena says, "She's in that 'I'll do anything for the bard' haze." </p>
		<p>"She means well."</p>
		<p>"You know, her boyfriend is in love with you, Gabrielle."</p>
		<p>"Mmm. Guess I'll have to straighten that out, have a sensitive chat with him." </p>
		<p>Xena laughs. "I'm sure there's nothing he'd like better. And when that doesn't work, you can call me in to rough him up a little."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle gives her a look, which she ignores. Instead, she picks up the frog and regards it curiously. "What's the point in this? It doesn't <i>do</i> anything. Now if its legs moved .... Maybe I'll suggest that to Senticles next time we see him."</p>
		<p>Xena shifts position and gets a startled look on her face. It changes to a sly smile. </p>
		<p>Gabrielle looks at her. "Xena. What are you doing?"</p>
		<p>"Nothing." An innocent look that doesn't convince. "Why?"</p>
		<p>"Hmmm!" Gabrielle looks round for something, then frowns. "Have you seen the loofah?"</p>
		<p>Xena pretends not to have heard. "What?"</p>
		<p>"The loofah." Gabrielle realizes that Xena is doing something naughty with it. Imperiously, she demands, "Hand it over."</p>
		<p>Xena pouts, sighs, reaches down into the water, and brings up the loofah. "Just as I was getting to the good bit too."</p>
		<p>Undaunted, Gabrielle proceeds to use the loofah on her own back. "Ah," she gives a sigh of pleasure.</p>
		<p>Xena contents herself with playing with the duck.</p>
