<!-- Another Day In The Life (aka How Gabrielle Got Her Pink Nighty) \ Brunch Is Served -->

<p>A fire is burning merrily, and Gabrielle is cooking fish. Xena is nowhere to be seen. Farris is watching Gabrielle add judicious amounts from her herb and spice kit, and ostentatiously smelling the delicious aroma. "You can cook too?"</p>
		<p>"Erm, yes," says Gabrielle.</p>
		<p>Xena appears through the trees. "I got us some blackberries for after," she says, placing a juice-stained bundle on the ground and taking her seat.</p>
		<p>"Yum." Gabrielle is so busy cooking so doesn't notice that the stained green cloth around the berries is her ex-nighty. </p>
		<p>Xena: "Are you a villager or an Amazon? "</p>
		<p>Gabrielle: "Amazon."</p>
		<p>Farris speaks quietly to Xena. "Where did she learn to cook so well?"</p>
		<p>Xena gives him a patient smile. "Her mother, I think." To Gabrielle: "Are you Ephiny?"</p>
		<p>"No." A stomach gurgle. "Sorry. Thank the gods it's nearly ready. I could eat a horse." </p>
		<p>Nearby, Argo whinnies.</p>
		<p>"Sorry, Argo," mumbles Gabrielle. </p>
		<p>"Has she ever talked about settling down?" Farris asks Xena.</p>
		<p>"Not recently. She tried it once. It didn't take." She sniffs suspiciously. To Gabrielle: "Did you put garlic in mine?"</p>
		<p>Gabrielle looks testily at her. "<i>Of course,</i> I put garlic in yours. We're <i>all</i> having garlic. You got a problem with that?"</p>
		<p>"Uh uh, no problem," says Xena hastily. "Garlic's good. As long as we both have it."</p>
		<p>"So," Farris continues doggedly. "Maybe she just hasn't met the right guy."</p>
		<p>"I don't think that's it, Farris. She likes what I do ... er I mean, what she's doing."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle begins dishing up the meal onto platters. She hands each of them a portion of fish. There's silence while they eat. </p>
		<p>At the first taste, Farris looks like he's having an orgasm. "Delicious. Simply delicious."</p>
		<p>Xena and Gabrielle exchange glances but say nothing. They finish the fish, and Gabrielle collects up the plates while Xena reaches for the blackberries. She has unwrapped them and is holding out the open bundle when Gabrielle realizes what the green cloth She lets out a screech that makes Xena jump (in the process spilling the blackberries on the floor). </p>
		<p>"What?" Xena looks around anxiously. "Is it a snake? Did it bite you?" </p>
		<p>"How could you? That blackberry juice will never come out."</p>
		<p>Xena sighs. "By the gods Gabrielle. Is that all? I thought you said the nighty was only fit for a duster anyway."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle looks sulky. "I changed my mind." Absentmindedly, she pops some of the blackberries into her mouth and starts to chew. She blinks at the taste then looks at Xena, her bad mood forgotten. "These are wonderful."</p>
		<p>Xena smiles with relief and helps herself to some. "Not bad. Try some, Farris." He obliges.</p>
		<p>The meal is over. The dirty dishes await. No one seems prepared to do anything about them.</p>
		<p>"It's your turn to do the dishes, Xena," hints Gabrielle not so subtly.</p>
		<p>Xena looks aggrieved. "I provided the food."</p>
		<p>"Well <i>I</i> cooked it."</p>
		<p>"Let <i>me</i> do the dishes for you, Gabrielle," says Farris eagerly. He takes them.</p>
		<p>She's surprised. "Thanks, Farris."</p>
		<p>Xena casts her a wry glance, and as Farris disappears out of earshot towards the stream, sits next to Gabrielle and says: "I think he's fallen for you."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle sighs. "I know."</p>
		<p>"Must be the bard thing."</p>
		<p>"Must be."</p>
		<p>"Or the blonde hair. Guys love blondes, you know."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle grins at her. "Or it could be the abs ... "</p>
		<p>"Yeah. Abs and knees ... they never fail. It's a wonder you aren't beating guys off constantly with your little stick." She does an exaggerated double take. "Oh, hang on. You are."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle makes a face. "The correct term is 'staff', Xena."</p>
		<p>"Whatever."</p>
		<p>"Maybe I should dye it."</p>
		<p>"The staff?"</p>
		<p>"No, the hair. I could try black hair, like yours."</p>
		<p>"Or you could wear your Amazon mask. That would keep the guys away."</p>
		<p>"What if it didn't? What if it just attracted a kinkier group?" </p>
		<p>"There is that."</p>
		<p>"I could always give up the bard thing ... take up singing instead?"</p>
		<p>Xena winces. "That would do it. Of course, then I'd have to wear ear plugs ... which would hamper my many skills."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle is torn between indignation and laughter - she opts for laughter. Xena joins in.</p>
		<p>Farris returns not only with clean dishes, but some sprigs of flowering yellow shrub which he presents to Gabrielle. "Fragrant blooms for a sweet blossom."</p>
		<p>Stunned, Gabrielle accepts them. "Uh ... thanks, Farris." She gets up and walks off.</p>
		<p>Farris to Xena: "Did you see <i>that</i>?" </p>
		<p>Xena. "What?"</p>
		<p>"She took them. She <i>likes</i> me! </p>
		<p>Xena (to herself): "Oh <i>boy</i>."</p>
