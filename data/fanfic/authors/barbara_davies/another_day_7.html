<!-- Another Day In The Life (aka How Gabrielle Got Her Pink Nighty) \ Choosing The Right Footwear -->

<p>Xena's riding Argo towards Aucuba. As she guides Argo up a steep hillside, the earth begins to shake in response to heavy thudding sounds. Argo whinnies. Xena soothes her, "There, there, girl. Don't worry. It's further away than it sounds."</p>
		<p>At the top of the hill she reins Argo to a halt and stares at her surroundings. There's chaos in the valley below her. A giant that looks just like Gareth is stomping Loxius and his army like ants. The townspeople are sheltering behind walls. </p>
		<p>"Sissy am I?" comes a distant roar.</p>
		<p>Xena scrutinizes the giant's attire ... "Ah, sandals," she says with great satisfaction. She turns Argo and heads her back the way they came. </p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Rheta is industriously sewing something made of pink material, while Gabrielle is reading through one of Rheta's scrolls. </p>
		<p>"You see this isn't your real beginning," says Gabrielle, tapping the scroll. "Your real beginning is actually here, where you meet Farris for the first time and it's hate at first sight. All this preamble," - she taps again authoritatively, "could be pruned."</p>
		<p>Rheta looks half interested, half depressed. "What's the point in finishing it now anyway?" She casts Gabrielle a significant glance. "I only write stories with happy endings, and this one isn't going to have one ..." </p>
		<p>"You don't know that."</p>
		<p>"Ha!" She sews a bit more then pauses as the unfairness of her predicament gets to her again. "It's not as though you can't have your pick of men. They must be throwing themselves at someone like you, but me ...</p>
		<p>"Look, Rheta. I can assure you, there is nothing between me and your boyfriend."</p>
		<p>"You say that, but I've seen the way he looks at you."</p>
		<p>"It's just infatuation. It'll wear off. And once I've found a way to send him the right message ..."</p>
		<p>Just then Farris barges in, strikes a pose - half nervous, half confident - and says, "Girls. I can no longer hide the feelings of my heart. I think I'm in love with Gabrielle."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle puts her hand to her mouth, and Rheta gives a small groan.</p>
		<p>Then Xena comes rushing in. Gabrielle gets up and goes to her, and says under her breath: "This Farris situation. It's just got worse."</p>
		<p>Xena says, "Later, Gabrielle." She turns to address the others. "Griffith is stomping Loxius. It won't be long now before he turns his attention to us."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle. "So are you going with the flying parchment, or the mirrors, or ... "</p>
		<p>Xena gives Gabrielle an impatient glance. "Neither. I'm going to use poison."</p>
		<p>"Poison? And where are we going to find enough to make a dent in a giant?!"</p>
		<p>Xena taps her nose significantly. "Watch and learn, Gabrielle."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Xena, Gabrielle, Rheta, and Farris are all wearing thick leather gauntlets and all carrying (very gingerly) huge sacks whose openings have been secured with strong ropes. They walk up to the pothole in the middle of the road, untie the ropes, and carefully tip the contents of the sacks into it. They are lots and lots of snakes, of all shapes and sizes.</p>
		<p>"Urk!" says Gabrielle, suppressing a shudder. "I hate snakes." </p>
		<p>"I'm not too keen on them myself," says Xena, using the tip of her boot to shove a stray snake into the pothole. The snakes slither and hiss. "Now all we have to do is get the giant to put his foot in the hole."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle gapes at Xena as though she's gone stark staring bonkers. "<i>That's</i> your plan?"</p>
		<p>Xena smiles proudly. "Yep. Simple, but effective."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle puts her hands on her hips. "Is Griffith blind?"</p>
		<p>"No, Gabrielle."</p>
		<p>"Well, will he be coming along this road at night?"</p>
		<p>"Probably not."</p>
		<p>Rheta is snickering, hiding her mouth with her hand.</p>
		<p>"You don't think he might be able to .... erm .... avoid the pothole, Xena?" says Gabrielle sarcastically.</p>
		<p>Xena shrugs. "It's possible."</p>
		<p>Rheta turns to Farris and mutters, "No wonder your precious bard was able to tame the fierce warrior princess. She's got a screw loose."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle: "Look, Xena. Maybe I'm missing something, but ... the odds on his putting his foot in this hole are a little on the long side, aren't they?"</p>
		<p>Xena gets huffy. "Well, what's <i>your</i> plan?" </p>
		<p>Gabrielle holds her hands up appeasingly. "Sorry. It's just that ... well ... there's still time for us to get the mirrors in position, isn't there. It's a sunny day and ..."</p>
		<p>"I'd rather go with the snakes."</p>
		<p>"You'd rather ... " A speechless Gabrielle watches a snake climb up out of the pothole and crawl away. </p>
		<p>"The odds won't be that bad, anyway. He'll be chasing me ... and I'll head straight for the snakepit." Xena turns to Farris. "Did you find the bees?"</p>
		<p>He nods. Just inside the wood over there." He points. "There's a hollow oak tree."</p>
		<p>"Thanks." Another snake has successfully climbed out of the pit and is crawling away. An absent-minded Xena uses her boot to shepherd it back into the pit. "Looks like we're all set then." </p>
		<p>She turns to Gabrielle. "Can you keep an eye on the snakes? I just want to check out these bees."</p>
		<p>A speechless Gabrielle watches her walk away.</p>
