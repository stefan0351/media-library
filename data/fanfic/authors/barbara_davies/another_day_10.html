<!-- Another Day In The Life (aka How Gabrielle Got Her Pink Nighty) \ Getting Ready For Bed -->

<p>It is nighttime, and Xena and Argo are in a clearing. Gabrielle is nowhere to be seen.</p>
		<p>Xena tucks some dried flowers into the brim of Argo's new hat. "There. Finished." She show it to Argo. "See? Now you have something nice to wear when we next go to the beach."</p>
		<p>Argo whinnies her approval.</p>
		<p>Xena frowns and looks back across the clearing to a shrub draped with items of discarded clothing: the BGSB, a skirt, an Amazon belt .... "Gabrielle? What's taking you so long?"</p>
		<p>Silence.</p>
		<p>"It can't be <i>that</i> bad," says Xena. "Can it?"</p>
		<p>The silence is broken by a <i>Whee</i> as Gabrielle, clad in a pink nighty, comes swinging across the clearing clinging to a vine like Tarzan. She heads straight for a startled Xena.</p>
		<p>They end up in a tangle of arms and legs in the middle of clearing, Gabrielle lying on top of Xena.</p>
		<p>"Gotcha," chortles Gabrielle. "Told you I would, didn't I?" She tries to get up ... and finds she can't. Strong arms are holding her in place.</p>
		<p>"No, I've got <i>you</i>!" says Xena wickedly. Then she relents and lets go of the bard.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle gets to her feet. "So." She brushes herself off and straightens her clothing. "What do you think?" She twirls, displaying her new and very skimpy nighty to full effect.</p>
		<p>Xena gapes at her. "I thought the whole point was you wanted a nighty with long sleeves, Gabrielle. That .... thing barely even has shoulder straps! As for the front ... it's cut so low there isn't one. And the back -"</p>
		<p>"I know, I know." Gabrielle looks sheepish. "Rheta ran out of material ... what could I do?"</p>
		<p>"Well, I suppose it doesn't look too bad ... on you," concedes Xena grudgingly. "Not everyone could carry it off." </p>
		<p>Gabrielle's face glows with pleasure.</p>
		<p>Xena strokes her chin as though considering. "But I think it still needs something."</p>
		<p>"Oh!" Gabrielle looks concerned. "What?" She gives herself a quick once over. "Should I shorten it? Lengthen it? Take in the waist? Let out the bust ..."</p>
		<p>Xena interrupts Gabrielle's worried litany. "Nah." She grabs Argo's new hat and plops it on top of Gabrielle's head. "There. Perfect." Argo whinnies with laughter and Xena gives her a conspiratorial grin.</p>
		<p>"Xena!" The bard starts to chase a laughing Xena round the clearing ...</p>
