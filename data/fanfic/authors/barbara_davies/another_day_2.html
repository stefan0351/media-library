<!-- Another Day In The Life (aka How Gabrielle Got Her Pink Nighty) \ Travelling To Work -->

<p>Xena, Gabrielle and Argo are strolling along a road. "Which way, Xena?" asks Gabrielle.</p>
		<p>Xena looks a bit dubious. "It's ages since I was here last, and they've had lots of landslips and cave-ins since then."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle puts her foot in a small pothole and trips, but Xena prevents her from falling. "Watch where you're walking. Can't have you twisting your ankle."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle rubs her ankle ruefully. "All these potholes!"</p>
		<p>"Limestone," says Xena knowledgeably. "Great for smelting."</p>
		<p>"That's why Aucuba has furnaces?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah. Lots of them."</p>
		<p>"So if you don't know the way, why don't you ask someone?" A stranger appears up ahead. "Him for example."</p>
		<p>"I don't need directions, Gabrielle. I'm sure it's this way."</p>
		<p>"Sure?"</p>
		<p>"Well, fairly sure."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle rolls her eyes and makes for the man now coming up to meet them. He's a bit like Hower - big and dumb. "Excuse me ..." she begins.</p>
		<p>He freezes and gapes at her. "You're Gabrielle, the bard of Potadeia, aren't you?"</p>
		<p>She blinks at him. "Er, yes. Now, what I wanted to ask you was - "</p>
		<p>He glances at Xena then returns his gaze to Gabrielle. "The one who tamed the Warrior Princess."</p>
		<p>"'Tamed'?" growls Xena.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle gives her a sheepish glance. "Some might put it that way, I suppose, but - "</p>
		<p>"My village needs the Warrior Princess's help desperately but we cannot pay her. Please use your inspiring words to soften her heart."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle is speechless. </p>
		<p>"You <i>can</i> talk to me directly, you know," interrupts Xena. "I don't bite," she mock bares her teeth at Gabrielle, "much."</p>
		<p>"Is Loxius after your village?" asks Gabrielle, regaining her equilibrium.</p>
		<p>The man frowns. "Who's Loxius? No. Our problem is a giant."</p>
		<p>Xena and Gabrielle exchange a 'Not another one!' glance.</p>
		<p>"He wants to flatten our village."</p>
		<p>"But only if you don't pay him protection money surely?" prompts Gabrielle.</p>
		<p>"No. He'll do it no matter what. He's in a really bad mood. A couple of days ago, someone killed his twin brother."</p>
		<p>"Well, I s'pose that <i>could</i> ruin your week." Xena looks shifty. "Was his brother called Gareth, by any chance?"</p>
		<p>He gapes. "How did you know?"</p>
		<p>"Just great," mutters Xena under her breath.</p>
		<p>"So," says Gabrielle. "Two villages in dire straits. What a coincidence." She turns brightly to Xena. "Shall you toss the coin or will I?"</p>
		
		<hr></hr>
		
		<p>Xena and Gabrielle are strolling along side by side. "So, how far is it to Kalmia, Farris?" asks Xena.</p>
		<p>Farris, who is spending most of his time walking backwards staring at Gabrielle, shrugs. "Not far."</p>
		<p>Xena and Gabrielle exchange a rueful glance and walk on a bit further.</p>
		<p>"Do they sell nighties in your village?" She shoots Xena a significant glance.</p>
		<p>"You know, I <i>really</i> don't wanna hear about this all day," says Xena.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle: "Well next time we're staying at my parents', <i>you</i> can explain why I'm sleeping in the nude."</p>
		<p>Xena sighs. "Fine." </p>
		<p>They walk for a while in silence. A little later, they start to play their travel game. </p>
		<p>Xena: "Are you male or female?"</p>
		<p>Gabrielle: "Female."</p>
		<p>"Living, or dead?"</p>
		<p>"Living."</p>
		<p>Xena, throwing a playful glance at Gabrielle: "Were you <i>not</i> killed by a certain bard?" </p>
		<p>Gabrielle: "Har de har! Just because I haven't lost my blood innocence and you have." Under her breath, "Boy, have you ever!"</p>
		<p>Xena ignores the remark. "Well <i>that</i> narrows it down ... NOT."</p>
		<p>They walk on a bit, Farris still doing his backward-admiring-the-bard thing. </p>
		<p>Xena: "Lila?"</p>
		<p>Gabrielle smirks. "No."</p>
		<p>Xena purses his lips in thought, and while she's occupied, Gabrielle swings her staff at her. Xena catches it easily. "Are you <i>still</i> doing that? It's not necessary, Gabrielle. You beat me fair and square." She indicates her fading back eye and Gabrielle looks guilty.</p>
		<p>"That doesn't count. You let me hit you."</p>
		<p>"Did not."</p>
		<p>"Did."</p>
		<p>"Gabrielle!" Xena shakes her head. "Whatever." Then her mood changes and she gives Gabrielle a wicked grin. "Well, I won't let you hit me <i>again</i>."</p>
		<p>"Aha!" Gabrielle's eyes glint. "Look out, Warrior Princess. 'Cause this time I'm gonna get you." She juts her jaw determinedly. </p>
		<p>Xena raises an eyebrow in disbelief and pointedly turns her attention to Farris. "So this giant ... what did you say his name is?"</p>
		<p>Farris: "'Griffith'."</p>
		<p>"What is about giants that their names all begin with a G and end in a th?" asks Gabrielle.</p>
		<p>Xena ignores her and continues doggedly. "He's Gareth's twin?"</p>
		<p>Farris nods. "Identical."</p>
		<p>"Same height, same armour?"</p>
		<p>Farris nods again. "I believe so."</p>
		<p>"Maybe they got a discount for bulk purchase," says Gabrielle.</p>
		<p>Xena gives her a look.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, a strange growling is heard. They all look at Gabrielle's stomach. Xena grins.</p>
		<p>Gabrielle says tetchily: "I had no breakfast. All right?" She glances at Xena. "Fish would be good. And we have a frying pan ... " She wrinkles her nose cheekily. </p>
		<p>Xena ignores her jibe. "Farris. Is there a creek nearby?"</p>
		<p>He nods. "That way, through the trees. But be careful. This is snake country."</p>
		<p>Gabrielle turns a terrified look at Xena. "Snake country?"</p>
		<p>Xena smiles at her. "Don't worry. From what I remember of this region, they only attack if you annoy them. As long as you remember to check your boots each morning before you put them on you'll be f-"</p>
		<p>"My boots?" Gabrielle panics. "By the gods, I didn't check my boots!"</p>
		<p>"Well there can't have been any snakes in them, or you'd be dead by now," says Xena dryly.</p>
		<p>"Thanks. I feel so much better."</p>
		<p>Throughout this exchange, Farris can't keep his eyes off Gabrielle. Then her stomach growls again and he blinks in startled admiration. </p>
		<p>"Everything about her is so much larger than life," he says.</p>
		<p>Xena rolls her eyes. "Is that meant to be a compliment?" She leads the way into the woods.</p>
