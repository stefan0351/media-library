<!-- When First We Met \ Story -->

<p>Buffy sat in her room looking out the window at the quaint Sunnydale
street, sure this wasn't LA, but that was something she was ready to
put behind her.  A year ago her mom would have had to drug her here
kicking and screaming, but that was before it happened, before her
calling.  First she had met the watcher Merrick and then learned that
she was the chosen one the slayer.  She had been introduced to a
world she wanted nothing to do with, one where Vampires and Demons
existed and she had to fight them, yes Buffy Summers was indeed glad
to have LA behind her, it was time for a change, time to start over
and try to build something that resembled a normal life.  </p>

<p>Tears formed in the petite blonde girl's eyes, as she thought about
that fateful night, the one that led her mom and her moving to this
place.  The master had come, he had killed her watcher, and ruined
her life.  Her friends in LA had abandoned her, and she had been
expelled from school all because of her calling.</p>

<p>"Buffy," Joyce Yelled from down stairs, snapping the girl out of her
thoughts.</p>

<p>"What is it Mom?"</p>

<p>"You better hurry, don't want to be late for your first day of
school."</p>

<p>"No, Wouldn't want that," Buffy grumbled, grabbing her backpack off
the dresser, &lt;This time it's gonna be different&gt;.</p>

<p>Buffy rushed down stares, "Bye mom see ya later."</p>

<p>"OK, have fun, and don't worry you're going to make lots of friends."</p>

<p>"OK, Mom, bye now," Buffy replied as she headed for the door.</p>

<p>"And honey, try not to get kicked out this time."</p>

<p>"OK Mom, I will."</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>"Hey Willow, did you hear, there's a new girl in school," Xander
stated Harris.</p>

<p>"Yeah I heard, have you met her yet,"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," Xander sheepishly replied.</p>

<p>
"What's that suppose to mean," Willow inquired.</p>

<p>"It means, that he almost knocked himself out staring at her," Jesse
shouted as he walked up behind his friends.</p>

<p>"I did not," Xander exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes you did, I saw it.  The X-man her was skateboarding by the steps
when, she walked by, practically crashed into the railing because he
was busy staring at her, can't say that I blame him though, she is
totally hot."</p>

<p>"Is that true Xander," Willow asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," reluctantly admitted Xander.</p>

<p>"Then it serves you right," Willow state before heading of to her
first class.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>Buffy sat nervously in the principals office as he reviewed her
records form LA.</p>

<p>"Hmm…Hemery high school, looks like you had quite a career there Miss
Summers, but that's behind you know, Welcome to Sunnydale," Bob
Fluttie Replied as he continued to read his new students transcript.</p>

<p>Mr Fluttie then tore up the transcript, "You have a clean slate, what
the?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Fluttie?"</p>

<p>"All my students are free to call me Bob."</p>

<p>"Bob."</p>

<p>"But they don't."</p>

<p>"Oh, uh…Mr. Fluttie, is something wrong?"</p>

<p>"It seems you have a colorful past Miss Summers."</p>

<p>"I know it looks kinda bad."</p>

<p>"You burnt the gym down."</p>

<p>"It wasn't as bad as it sounds."</p>

<p>"I believe you Miss Summers, but you must remember this is not LA,
and you have a fresh start her at Sunnydale," Mr. Fluttie replied,
taping the transcript back together.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>Buffy sat in her first class of the day and wondered how things where
going to turn out here, she had gotten of to a bad start with the
principle and now here she was in history class and without the any
books.  </p>

<p>She nervously looked around the room as the teacher started lecturing
on the black plague.  Fortunately the brunette next to her was kind
enough to share her book.</p>

<p>"Hi I'm Cordelia," the girl replied as they got up from their seats
after class.</p>

<p>"I'm Buffy."</p>

<p>"If you need a text book, try the libary."</p>

<p>"Thanks, uh, where might that be?"</p>

<p>"I'll show you, come on.  So you're from Hemery, right? In L.A.?"</p>

<p>" Uh, yeah."</p>

<p>"I would *kill* to live in L.A.  That close to that many shoes."</p>

<p>After walking down a couple of halls Cordelia stopped and looked at
Buffy," This is it.  If your going to hang with me I will need to
test your coolness factor first, since you're form LA we can skip the
written part.  Let me see Vamp nail polish?"</p>

<p>"So over?</p>

<p>"Frappaccinos?"</p>

<p>" Trendy, but tasty."</p>

<p>"John Tesh.?"</p>

<p>" The Devil."</p>

<p>"That was pretty much a gimme, but... you passed!"</p>

<p>"Oh, goody!"</p>

<p>Cordelia then looked over at a redheaded girl at the drinking
fountain, "Willow!  Nice dress, it's good to see you're getting with
the softer side of Sears."</p>

<p>"Uh, oh, well, my mom picked it out", the redhead nervously replied.</p>

<p>"No wonder you're such a guy magnet.  Are you done?"</p>

<p>"Oh," Willow replied for taking off down the hall.</p>

<p>Buffy watched her as she left, she wanted to say something to
Cordelia about the way she had treated the other girl but didn't,
after all so far Cordelia was the only friend she had at school, but
it did bother her that Cordelia had treated the redhead that way.
&lt;Maybe I should talk to her later&gt;.</p>

<p>"You wanna fit in here, the first rule is: know your losers.  Once you
can identify them all by sight they're a lot easier to avoid,"
Cordelia snidely replied.

"Also if you're not too swamped with catching up you should come by
the Bronze tonight," the brunette added.</p>

<p>"The who?"</p>

<p>"The Bronze.  It's the only club worth going to around here.  They
let anybody in, but it's still the scene. It's in the bad part of
town."</p>

<p>"Where's that?" </p>

<p>"About a half a block from the good part of town," Cordelia
chuckled, "We don't have a whole lot of town here. But, um, you
should show."</p>

<p>"I'll be there, well guess I should go in and get some books now."</p>

<p>"Sounds good, later," Cordelia replied as she turned and walked down
the hall.</p>

<p>Buffy walked through the door into the empty library, "Is any one
here?"</p>

<p>A middle age man wearing glasses stepped out from behind a
bookcase, "I'm Mr. Giles, the Liberian.  Can I help you?"</p>

<p>"I'm…"</p>

<p>"Buffy Summers," Giles answered.</p>

<p>"Yes, but how did you know my name.  Wait never mind, small town, I'm
most likely the only new kid here."</p>

<p>"True, how can I help you," the Liberian inquired as he studied
Buffy."</p>

<p>Buffy was beginning to feel nervous about how the Liberian was
acting," I need some books."</p>

<p>"I see, I think I got what your looking for," Giles stated as he
reached under the counter and pulled out a rather large book.</p>

<p>He laid the book out in front of Buffy, and her eyes grew wide as she
red the title, Vapmyr.</p>

<p>"I don't want that, I just want to get books for class," Buffy
exclaimed as the memories of LA flooded back into her mind.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Positive!"</p>

<p>Giles gave her a bewildered look, "I'm sorry, I guess I was mistaken,
let me get your text books for you."</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>Buffy walked into the quad and immediately noticed Willow sitting
down at a bench preparing to eat her lunch, so she walked over to the
other girl, "Hi, I'm Buffy."</p>

<p>"I'm Willow, uh do you want this bench," Willow asked as she started
to get up.</p>

<p>"No, I just want to talk," Buffy replied as she took a seat next to
the redhead.</p>

<p>"To Me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to you."</p>

<p>"But what about Cordelia?"</p>

<p>"What about her?"</p>

<p>"I saw you two talking."</p>

<p>"If this is about earlier, I would like to apologize, it was her
doing.  I'm sorry I didn't say anything."</p>

<p>Willow's mind filled with confusion as she tried to figure out what
was going on, "What's going on here, what do you want?"</p>

<p>"I was hoping that you could help me with my classes but that is
beside the point, why do I need to want something in order to talk to
you."</p>

<p>"Most everyone else does."</p>

<p>"I'm not everyone else, I'm Buffy, and besides you seem like you
would like to get to know."</p>

<p>"That would be nice, but what about Cordelia?"</p>

<p>"She seemed OK, can't I be friends with both of you?"</p>

<p>"I think that my be illegal, you know unwritten law.'</p>

<p>"Then I guess it's her loss, where would you like to study?"</p>

<p>Willow sat there a moment as she gathered her thoughts, did she just
say that she would rather be a friend with me than Cordelia thought
the redhead.</p>

<p>"Uh, you still there."</p>

<p>"Yeah, Willow replied.</p>

<p>"Good, so where would you like to study."</p>

<p>"How about the library?"</p>

<p>"It gives me the creeps."</p>

<p>"But it's so nice, there is lots of books and the new Liberian is
really smart.  He just transferred her from England."</p>

<p>"England?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, he worked for some museum there."</p>

<p>Buffy recalled her visit to the library earlier and then though about
what Willow had just said &lt;I am Merrick, a watcher&gt;.  As she set next
to Willow on the bench she could feel it all beginning again &lt;No,
it's supposed to be different this time&gt;.</p>

<p>"Uh, Buffy you still there."</p>

<p>"Sorry guess it was my turn to space out."</p>

<p>"It's OK.  If you don't want to study at the library where would you
like to go."</p>

<p>"How about the bronze."</p>

<p>"You want me to go to the bronze with you."</p>

<p>"Yeah, it would be fun."</p>

<p>"It's kinda noisy for studying."</p>

<p>"Well we could go there for a while then somewhere else to study."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you want to go to the Bronze with me."</p>

<p>"I'm positive," Buffy replied hoping that she wasn't coming on to
strong for Willow.</p>

<p>"That would be nice."</p>

<p>"Hey Wills, see ya met the new Girl," Xander replied as he and Jesse
took seats on another bench across from the two girls.</p>

<p>"Buffy this is Xander and Jesse."</p>

<p>"Nice to meet you, I'm Buffy."</p>

<p>Buffy looked at Willow, "Don't they talk?'</p>

<p>"I think that they both bit their tongues when you talked to them,"
Willow smirked causing Buffy to giggle.</p>

<p>"Hey no fair," Jesse shouted.</p>

<p>"Ditto," Xander added.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled at Willow, "They're funny."</p>

<p>"But harmless," Willow added before turning to the young men, "so
anything going on?"</p>

<p>"You mean you haven't heard," Xander asked.</p>

<p>"Heard what?"</p>

<p>"They found our quarterback stuffed in a locker in the girls locker
room."</p>

<p>"What," Willow exclaimed.</p>

<p>"That's what I though."</p>

<p>"Oh, my, when?"</p>

<p>"A little while ago, it was really freaky."</p>

<p>Buffy's face grew solemn and she walked over to Xander, "What do you
mean by freaky."</p>

<p>"I mean they are saying that he didn't have any blood."</p>

<p>Buffy felt as if the wind had been knocked out of her, all the
memories of LA came rushing back.  She closed her eyes, she could see
the master killing her watcher, hear the screams as the vampires
poured into the gym, and see them as they closed in on her old
friends.</p>

<p>She looked at the two young men and turned to Willow, "Uh, I gotta go
uh, check on something, see ya tonight."</p>

<p>"OK," Willow replied as she watched Buffy bolt out of the Quad.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with her," Jesse asked.</p>

<p>"It's her first day of school her and a someone gets killed, it's
enough to freak out anyone.  I better had go see if she is OK." </p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>Buffy moved quietly through the locker room, making sure no one was
there.  She didn't want to be there, but she had to know if it was
starting again.</p>

<p>She found the body laying on the floor and bent over it.  She looked
at it for a moment, afraid of what she was going to find, finally she
tilted the dead boys head back revealing a set of fang marks &lt;No,
this can't be happening, not here, not now&gt;.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>Willow had looked almost everywhere for Buffy when she decided that
the cute blonde girl had most likely went home, so she headed to the
library to try and take her mind off of everything that had happened
today.  </p>

<p>Willow sat at a table off in the corner trying to read but it was
useless, all her thought led her to Buffy.  She wasn't sure why but
she knew that she was attracted to the blonde.  She could feel it in
her pounding heart when Buffy had sit down next to her in the quad,
and feel it in her soul when the Blonde had asked her to the Bronze.
&lt;Get a grip Rosenberg, she only wants to be a friend, you keep having
thought about that and you won't even get a chance for that&gt;.</p>

<p>Willow closed the book she was reading and prepared to leave when
Buffy Burst into the library.  The shy redhead knew something was up
by the expression on the blonde's face so she stepped in behind one
of the book cases and remained silent.</p>

<p>"Hey Liberian guy," Buffy screamed at the top of her lungs.</p>

<p>Giles turned around and looked at Buffy, "Is something wrong?"</p>

<p>"You tell me."</p>

<p>"Tell you what?"</p>

<p>"You did hear about the dead guy, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"'Cause, it's the weirdest thing. He's got two little, little  holes
in his neck, and all his blood's been drained. Isn't that bizarre?
Aren't you just going, ooo?"</p>

<p>"I was afraid of this."</p>

<p>"Well, *I* wasn't! It's my first day! I was afraid that I was gonna
be behind in all my classes, that I wouldn't make any friends, that I
would have last month's hair. I didn't think there'd be vampires
on campus. And I don't care."</p>

<p>"Then why are you here?"</p>

<p>"To tell you that... I don't care, which... I don't, and... have now
told you, so... bye." </p>

<p>"Is he, w-will he... rise again?"</p>

<p>"Will who rise again?"</p>

<p>"The boy, in the locker room that's who.".</p>

<p>"No. He's just dead."</p>

<p>"Can you be sure?"</p>

<p>"To make you a vampire they have to suck your blood. And then you
have to suck their blood.  It's like a whole big sucking thing.
Mostly they're just gonna kill you.  Why am I still talking to you?"</p>

<p>"You really have no idea what's going on, do you? You think it's
coincidence, your being here?  That boy was just the beginning."</p>

<p>"It's not fair, it was suppose to be different here, Why can't you
people leave me alone!"</p>

<p>"Because you are the Slayer.  Buffy, into each generation a Slayer is
born, one girl in all the world, a Chosen One, one born with the
strength and skill to hunt the vampires..."</p>

<p>"For cryin' out loud I know that…with the strength and skill to hunt
the vampires, to stop the spread of their evil blah, blah, blah.
I've heard it, okay?</p>

<p>"I really don't understand this attitude. You, you've accepted your
duty, you, you've slain vampires before."</p>

<p>"Yeah, and it cost me everything, I'm moving on."</p>

<p>Giles looked Buffy square in the eyes, Tell me, what do you really
know about this town</p>

<p>"It's two hours on the freeway from Neiman Marcus?"</p>

<p>"Not even close.  Dig a bit in the history of this place. You'll find
a, a steady stream of fairly odd occurrences. Now, I believe this
whole area is a center of mystical energy, that things gravitate
towards it that, that, that you might not find elsewhere." </p>

<p>"Like vampires."</p>

<p>"Yes, for starters but there is werewolves, incubi, succubi,
everything you've ever dreaded was under your bed, but told yourself
couldn't be by the light of day. They're all real!"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, did you like send away for Time-Life series on this
stuff?"</p>

<p>"Ah, w-w-w-yes."</p>

<p>"Cool, then you can kill them."</p>

<p>"It doesn't work that way  I-I'm a Watcher, I-I haven't the skill.".</p>

<p>"Oh, come on, stake through the heart, a little sunlight.  It's like
falling off a log."</p>

<p>"A, a Slayer slays, a Watcher..."</p>

<p>"Watches?"</p>

<p>"Yes.  No! He, he trains her, he, he, he prepares her," Giles replied.

"Prepares me for what? For getting kicked out of school? For losing
all of my friends? For having to spend all of my time fighting for my
life and never getting to tell anyone because I might endanger
them? Go ahead! Prepare me because I've already been down that road.".</p>

<p>Buffy then turned around and exited the library as quickly as she had
entered it.  Giles watched as the door slammed behind her and hit his
fist on one of the tables, "Damn!"</p>

<p>Giles stood there for a moment the bolted out the door after Buffy.
Willow stepped out from behind the bookcase and stared at the door,
&lt;Who are you Buffy Summers&gt;.</p>

<p>Giles caught up with Buffy in the hallway, "It's getting worse you
know."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean something big is about to happen."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by big.?</p>

<p>"Supernatural phenomena, end of days prophesy," Giles replied.</p>

<p>"You guys crack me up, It was one vampire, I'll find him stake him,
and it will be over.  I mean this is Sunnydale, what could possibly
happen here."</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>On the far side of town, well below the surface a group of vampires
had gathered bearing torches.  They stood around a blood of blood as
their leader began to chant, "The sleeper will wake, the sleeper will
wake, the sleeper will wake, The sleeper will wake, and the world
will bleed.  Amen!"</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>Xander and Jesse sat at their normal booth at the Bronze and watched
as Willow fidgeted in her seat.  "Do I look OK," the redhead.
nervously asked </p>

<p>"Wills for like the millionth time you look fine," Xander replied </p>

<p>"GoodbecuaseIwouldn'twanttolookbadoranythingnotthatit'simportantoranyt
hingit'snotlikeIhaveadatatleastIdon'tthinkIdo."</p>

<p>Xander and Jesse both looked at each other.  Did you understand a
word of that," Jesse asked.</p>

<p>"No, not a word." </p>

<p>The two of them looked at Willow for clarification, but only to
noticed that their friend seemed oblivious to their existence, her
eyes where gazing past them watching the other side of the Bronze.</p>

<p>The two boys turned around to see what had caught Willows attention
and noticed Buffy slowly walking towards the booth.</p>

<p>Xander looked at Willow, took a second glance at Buffy, then turned
to Jesse.  His eyes looked like they where about to pop out of his
head, "Uh, Jesse I think we might want to leave."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I think Wills has a crush and I don't want to be in the way."</p>

<p>"A crush?  On who?"</p>

<p>Buffy walked up to the booth and quickly sat down next to Willow, it
was obvious to the two young men that she was just as nervous as
their redheaded friend.</p>

<p>Jesse looked at Xander, "Oh,  uh…I think your right."</p>

<p>"Right about what," Willow asked, trying not to stare at Buffy.</p>

<p>"That me and the J-man her need to hit the dance floor and find some
girls."</p>

<p>Willow and Buffy where starting to grow comfortable with sitting
close to one another and talking.  Both of them could feel the
chemistry starting to develop between them, it was like they had
known each other for ever even though they had just met.</p>

<p>"Uh, I hate to irrupt but we need to talk," Giles stated as he stood
next to the booth.</p>

<p>Buffy looked over at him with fire in her eyes, "Can't it wait."</p>

<p>"NO, I'm afraid it can't."</p>

<p>"Buffy it's OK, I'm not going anywhere, go talk to Mr. Giles," Willow
replied.</p>

<p>"You sure?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure."</p>

<p>Willow watched as the blonde got up and walked over to the corner
with the Liberian, she wondered if they where talking more about
vampires and slayers again.  She didn't know what it all met but
somehow knew it was important, she just hoped that it didn't end up
costing her the price of not getting to know Buffy.</p>

<p>"This had better be good," Buffy stated as she glared at Giles.</p>

<p>"Two more bodies where found earlier this evening."</p>

<p>"So any leads on the vam….Oh, My God."</p>

<p>"What's wrong."</p>

<p>"That," Buffy responded, as she pointed to Jesse talking to a young
girl.</p>

<p>"Giles looked over at them, "What's wrong with that?"</p>

<p>"That's Willow's friend."</p>

<p>"And?"</p>

<p>"That Girl he is leaving with, she's a vampire."</p>

<p>"You sure."</p>

<p>"Positive, you stay with Willow, and make sure nothing happens to
her, I'll be right back."</p>

<p>Giles walked back over to the booth only to see that Willow wasn't
there, &lt;Great not only can't I get the slayer to listen, now I can't
even keep tract of a normal girl&gt;.</p>

<p>Willow burst into the ally that she had saw Buffy race of toward.</p>

<p>"She's not here Will's," yelled a confused Xander</p>

<p>"We got to find her, I think she could be in trouble."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"It's hard to say, you just have got to trust me on this."</p>

<p>"OK.  I guess we should go and find her for you."</p>

<p>Buffy tracked the vampire to a nearby grave yard, the whole time she
was doing so she had the feeling that she was being followed, but she
sensed that whoever or whatever was following her wasn't evil so she
continued on her search for Jesse.</p>

<p>After a few more minutes of searching the slayers luck picked up and
she spotted Jesse and the vampire go into a crypt.  Quietly she
followed them in, she was about to make her move when she heard
Xander loudly call out from behind her, "See Wills she's safe, can we
get out of here now."  </p>

<p>The Vampire spun around and looked at Buffy who now had Willow and
Xander behind her.</p>

<p>She grabbed Jesse by the collar and threw him to the ground, "I see
that we have more gifts for the master," hissed the blonde female as
she put on her game face and several other vampires moved from their
hiding places within the shadows of the crypt.</p>

<p>Buffy looked back at Xander and Willow and pulled a stake from her
jacket, "Get out of here now!"</p>

<p>Willow stood there confused as to what was happening as these human
looking creatures with their twisted faces began to close in on
them.  She wanted to run away from this place but her fear had the
best of her and she was unable to move her legs as her mind was
screamed for her to run.</p>

<p>Buffy launched into attack and quickly dusted two of the vampires
that where closest to them, she then struck an third one knocking him
to the ground.  Another vampire tired to rush past her and get to her
new friends but she closed lined him sending him to his back.  Buffy
dropped down on one knee and staked him, she then leg swept the
vampire she had knocked down and staked him.</p>

<p>She stood back up and faced the only two remaining vampires, the
female she had followed here and a male.</p>

<p>"The female vampire stared at her for a moment before speaking, "I'm
Darla who might you be?"</p>

<p>"It's none of you're business who I am, besides you're not going to
be around long enough to find out."</p>

<p>The male step forward, "Return to the master, she's mine."</p>

<p>He then charged Buffy.  She kicked him in the chest knocking him back
a few feet but he didn't go down, "I take it you're a slayer, always
wanted to kill a slayer hissed the vampire as he struck Buffy across
the face sending her reeling backwards.</p>

<p>"Leave her alone," Willow shouted as she rushed to Buffy.</p>

<p>"No Willow, don't..." screamed the slayer as saw the redhead coming to
her.</p>

<p>Her plea was too late and the vampire grabbed Willow and through her
to the ground, "I'll save you for later."</p>

<p>"No you won't, Buffy screamed, charging the vampire and struck him
with a barrage of powerful hits forcing him away from Willow.</p>

<p>The vampire quickly regained his composure and rushed Buffy but she
continued to fight like nothing he had ever seen before.  There was a
fire in her eyes that he couldn't place, but he knew he was in
trouble.</p>

<p>The vampire managed to block a couple of her blows and did a leg
sweep.  Instead of trying to take advantage of the situation he
bolted into the back of the crypt and vanished.</p>

<p>Buffy rolled up of the ground and quickly scanned for any remaining
vamps, she then rushed over to Willow as Xander was helping her off
the ground.</p>

<p>"Are you OK, non of them bite you or anything," Buffy inquired, her
voice filled with concern.</p>

<p>"Yeah, all he did was throw me down, though it did kinda hurt."</p>

<p>"You don't need medical help, do you?"</p>

<p>"No I'm just sore, But what about you?"</p>

<p>"I'm fine."</p>

<p>"You sure," Willow asked, "I mean those look like some pretty nasty
cuts."</p>

<p>"I hate to interrupted this but where is Jesse," inquired Xander.</p>

<p>Buffy quickly looked around the crypt, a look of concern came across
her face, "They got him."</p>

<p>"They being those things that just attacked us."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so," answered Buffy.</p>

<p>Willow walked over and placed her hand on the slayers
shoulder, "Buffy what where they?"</p>

<p>Buffy looked Willow in the eyes, she could feel her stomach muscles
starting to knot up.  She knew that there was something happening
between her and Willow and now she had to come clean about the
vampires and her being a slayer.  &lt;Please don't run away from me when
I tell you&gt;.</p>

<p>"They where vampires."</p>

<p>"I was afraid of that," answered Willow.</p>

<p>"You were?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I sorta heard you talking to Mr. Giles in the library."</p>

<p>"You did."</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"And you still met me at the bronze," inquired Buffy as some of her
fears began to fade away.</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't I," asked Willow.</p>

<p>"Because everyone else who has found out about this has abandoned me."</p>

<p>Willow placed her hands on Buffy's shoulders, "Then it's their loss."</p>

<p>Buffy looked Willow in the eyes and saw the sincerity that was
there, "Thanks."</p>

<p>"Hey I really hate to interrupt whatever is happening with you guys
but could we get back to this whole vampire thing," exclaimed Xander.</p>

<p>"I guess I have a lot of explaining to do, but I am not going to do
it alone, meet me in the library at lunch, OK."</p>

<p>"OK."</p>

<p>"Good now let me get you guys home safely."</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>Buffy and Willow had just walked Xander home and they where headed
towards Willow's house.  They hadn't said much to each other since
they left the crypt, mostly because they both knew what they where
feeling deep inside.  They knew that they needed to talk about it,
but neither of them wanted anyone else around when they did.</p>

<p>"Willow?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Can I talk to you?"</p>

<p>"You're doing that aren't you."</p>

<p>"That's not what I met."</p>

<p>"I know, it's just that I don't know how to say what I am feeling to
you."</p>

<p>Buffy took a big gulp, "Willow, I know we just met and I really want
you to be my friend.  I just hope you will still be around after I
say what I'm about to say."</p>

<p>Willow stopped in her tracks and turned and faced Buffy, "I won't
leave, I promise."</p>

<p>"I think I am falling for you."</p>

<p>"You do," asked Willow as her heart began to quicken.</p>

<p>Buffy's body was starting to shake from the anxiety that was soaring
through her system, "I..I...D-do."</p>

<p>"I was hoping you where going to say that."</p>

<p>"You where?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Buffy carefully took Willow by the hand, "So what do we do now?"</p>

<p>"We let it happen and see where it goes."</p>

<p>"That sounds nice," answered Buffy as her and Willow again started
walking to the redhead's house.</p>

<p>Buffy was headed home after dropping off Willow, she didn't know
weather she should be happy that Willow felt the same way or sad
because everything that she had thought she was leaving behind in LA
was reemerging.</p>

<p>When she rounded the corner she felt her senses kick in, she stopped
and carefully scanned the area but saw nothing, "Whoever or whatever
you are I know your there!"</p>

<p>A tall young man with dark hair stepped out of the shadows and
approached Buffy, "Are you ready?"</p>

<p>"It depends on what you are talking about."</p>

<p>"It's coming, you need to be prepared."</p>

<p>"Listen I don't want to play your silly game," shouted Buffy.</p>

<p>"It's not a game, the very mouth of hell is opening."</p>

<p>Buffy looked at the stranger, "Who are you?"</p>

<p>That's not important, what is important is that you are ready."</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"The harvest."</p>

<p>"What's the harvest?"</p>

<p>"Ask your watcher."</p>

<p>"How did you know I had a watcher?"</p>

<p>"All slayers do."</p>

<p>The man then stepped back away from Buffy and seemly vanished into
the night.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>The Darla forced Jesse into the underground lair, with the male one
right behind her.  She pushed the frightened boy to the ground before
a make shift alter.</p>

<p>"Kneel swine, The master approaches," shouted the male vampire.</p>

<p>A ancient looking man entered the room, everything about him screamed
with the essence of evil, ""Is this for me."</p>

<p>"It is an offering master," replied the male vampire.</p>

<p>"He is a good one, his blood is pure," added Darla.</p>

<p>"You tasted it, what am I a faithful dog that you feed
scrapes," screamed the Master in rage.</p>

<p>"I did not mean it.</p>

<p>"I have waited. For three score years I have waited. While you come
and go I am stuck here, here in this house of worship! My ascension
is almost at hand. Pray that when it comes.  Pray I'm in a better
mood".</p>

<p>"Master, forgive me! We had more offerings, but there was trouble"</p>

<p>"What kind of trouble," snarled the Mater.</p>

<p>"A girl.  She fought well and she knew of our breed.  I think she
might be....."</p>

<p>"A Slayer."</p>

<p>"Yes master," replied the male.</p>

<p>"Then destroy her Luke, nothing can interfere with my rising."</p>

<p>"Yes Master," answered the male.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>Buffy sat next to Willow in the library, and watched Giles pace back
and forth in front of them.
"Xander leaned over towards the two girls, "What's wrong with him."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," answered Buffy.</p>

<p>"What's wrong is that you shouldn't have brought them into this,
it's not their fight," snapped Giles.</p>

<p>"Look they followed me, I can't help that."</p>

<p>"OK I'm sorry, it's just I'm a little stressed out about all this,
forgive me."</p>

<p>"OK, but you need to tell them."</p>

<p>Giles sat down across from the three of them, "Know this, vampires
and demons are real.  They are not legends or myths but real
creatures without souls."</p>

<p>"What a second they can't be real," exclaimed Xander.</p>

<p>"And how do you explain what we saw, those where real," shouted
Willow.</p>

<p>Xander hung his head down, "I can't."</p>

<p>"But I can," interrupted Giles, "Those where vampires you saw.  I
know it might be hard for you to take in but it is the truth. The
last demon to leave this reality fed off a human, mixed their blood.
He was a human form possessed, infected by the Demon's soul. He bit
another, and another, and so they walk the Earth, feeding... Killing
some, mixing their blood with others to make more of their kind.
Waiting for the animals to die out, and the old ones to return."</p>

<p>Buffy leaned over to Willow, "Breath, OK."</p>

<p>"OK, but he just said.."</p>

<p>"I know, it's a lot to take in, it really freaked me out when I
first learned about it."</p>

<p>"It did?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, it did."</p>

<p>"Good because you're so calm right now and I was afraid I was the
only one that was having trouble grasping all of this."</p>

<p>"You're not if you think it will help I'll tell you how I got pulled
into this."</p>

<p>"It would."</p>

<p>"OK after I get Jesse back we'll sit down and talk about all of this
vampire and slayer stuff, just the two of us."</p>

<p>"That would be nice," replied Willow before turning her attention
back to Giles who was explaining some of the finer points of vampires
and demons to a rather confused Xander.</p>

<p>
Willow waited for the Liberian to finish talking them raised her
hand , "Mr. Giles, what is a slayer?"</p>

<p>"A slayer is the chosen one.  For each generation one is called to
fight against the vampires and demons.  She is given special
abilities that enable her to fulfill her calling."</p>

<p>Willow turned away from Giles and looked at the blonde whose hand she
was holding, she noted the look of sadness in Buffy's face and turned
back to Giles, "Why her, why does she have to be the one?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, no one does."</p>

<p>"What is that suppose to mean."</p>

<p>"It means that why someone is called as a slyer is a mystery, all I
do is find them and help them the best I can do."</p>

<p>"And how long does she have to fight, how long does this calling
last?"</p>

<p>"It never ends, it stays with her for the remainder of her life,"
sadly replied Giles.</p>

<p>Willow wrapped her arm around Buffy, she felt like she had just been
run hit by a two-ton truck.  For the first time in her life she had
found someone special, someone that she cared for and wanted to get
to know better, someone that she started falling in love with as soon
as she saw her, but that seemed to be slipping away from her as she
listened to the watchers words, her new friend and potential
girlfriend had a calling that appeared to be nothing more than a
death sentence.</p>

<p>Willow tightened her grip on Buffy and fought back the wave of
emotions that where ravishing her body, "It's not Fair!"</p>

<p>Giles lowered his head, "I know, but there is nothing I can do about
it."</p>

<p>Buffy assuredly whispered in Willow's ear, "It's not to late for you
to leave this behind you, and forget that it ever happened."</p>

<p>"I don't want to do that," softly cried Willow.</p>

<p>"Then we can work through it, together," assured Buffy.</p>

<p>Willow wasn't sure why she placed her head on Buffy's shoulder, all
she knew was that it made her feel safe, "together."</p>

<p>Giles waited a few seconds before addressing the slayer and the
others so they would have time to try and soak in everything "I think
I might know where they took Jesse."</p>

<p>"OK, I'm ready, spill," replied Buffy.</p>

<p>"It seems that there is a vast series of under ground caverns runs
underneath the graveyard, I think they might be there, but I have no
idea how to get to them."</p>

<p>Buffy paused for a moment, then it dawned upon her, "The crypt!"</p>

<p>"What about it?" </p>

<p>"When we first came into the crypt it was just Jesse and the one
vampire, the rest of them came out of nowhere.  The entrance has got
to be in the crypt."</p>

<p>"Then we go back there and get Jesse," stated Willow.</p>

<p>"No I go get him it's what I do, You could be hurt, and that is the
last thing in the world I want to happen."</p>

<p>"But It's too dangerous for you to go by yourself."</p>

<p>"Then I go with you," replied Xander.</p>

<p>"Nobody is going with me, I know what I am doing."</p>

<p>"But they're vampires."</p>

<p>"Exactly, and I am the slayer, that is why I have to go alone."</p>

<p>"She's right you know, plus I need you're help here," stated Giles.</p>

<p>"You need are help," questioned Willow.</p>

<p>"Yes you see I have discovered something about the harvest.  It seems
that it is some sort of preordained massacre. Rivers of blood, Hell
on Earth, quite charmless.  It's kinda vague after that."</p>

<p>"How can I help with that, I'm really not even sure what you are
talking about."</p>

<p>"I need someone to get on that blasted thing and try to find more
information on this area and references to the harvest," Giles
replied pointing towards a computer in the corner, "Can you help me."</p>

<p>Willow smiled at Giles, the idea of being able to help Buffy greatly
appealed to her, "I can do that."</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Buffy stood in the crypt mentally preparing for the task at hand.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't do that if I was you," replied the mysterious messenger
as he stepped out of the shadows.</p>

<p>"And why is that."</p>

<p>"Because they are down they're waiting."</p>

<p>"Who is waiting."</p>

<p>"The master and the others that is who, if you go down there they
will be there waiting for you."</p>

<p>"I have no choice."</p>

<p>"It could be a trap, you don't even know if your friend is still
alive."</p>

<p>"Abut if he is I have to save him, and if you think it is a trap come
with me."</p>

<p>"I can't."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"Then at least you could tell me who you are."</p>

<p>"I'm Angel."</p>

<p>"OK Angel, It's been strange talking to you, but I have someone to go
rescue."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't do that you are needed here tonight is the harvest, if
the master rises all is loss."</p>

<p>"Then I'll have to make sure I make it back in time.  Wish me luck."</p>

<p>Angel watched as Buffy turned away from him and headed down towards
the underground world of the Master, "Good luck."</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>Buffy worked her way through the maze, she cam to an intersection
where
Several tunnels converged.  She heard footsteps behind, her, slowly
the slayer reached sown in her jacked and pulled out a stake.  She
waited for a moment the quickly spun around posed to strike only to
come face to face with Xander.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here," exclaimed Buffy.</p>

<p>"I followed you, I want to help."</p>

<p>"You can't now go."</p>

<p>"Uh, that would be a problem," replied Xander.</p>

<p>"And why is that?"</p>

<p>"I kinda don't know the way out of here."</p>

<p>Buffy looked at him and shook her head, "Fine but stay behind me and
be quite.  Comprenday?"</p>

<p>"Will do," answered Xander as he turned on a flashlight.</p>

<p>"Turn that thing off!  Do you want them to know we are here?"</p>

<p>"Sorry," replied Xander as he quickly turned off the flashlight.</p>

<p>Xander could feel his heart beat rapidly increasing as they made
their way deeper into the under ground maze, "So it that stake the
only way you can kill them?"</p>

<p>"No there is also holy water, sunlight, you know the usual."</p>

<p>"How about crosses, because I brought a cross, saw it in a movie."</p>

<p>"It won't kill them but it will fend them off."</p>

<p>Gripping the cross in his pocket, Xander nervously replied, "That'll
work."</p>

<p>Buffy and Xander approached a large room, that was dimly lit.
Although Xander could not make out much of the room, Buffy's slayer
abilities allowed her to see Jesse chained to the far wall.  </p>

<p>"He's in there, but we have to be careful this could be a trap."</p>

<p>"A trap, that's just..great," gulped Xander.</p>

<p>Buffy and Xander cautiously approached Jesse.  </p>

<p>"Boy am I glad to see you guys," shouted Jesse, "these things have
been holding me here for awhile, something about me being some kinda
bait.'</p>

<p>"Damn it is a trap," replied Buffy, "Xander keep an eye open I'll get
these chains off."</p>

<p>"Sounds like a plan," Xander excitably responded, "Don't worry Jesse
we'll get you out of her, she's some kinda supergirl."</p>

<p>"Great, because I'm ready to leave, and I think that's it's gonna
take super powers to get out of here."</p>

<p>Buffy quickly grabbed Jesse's chains and snapped them in half, "OK
guys it's time to get out of here."</p>

<p>"Not so fast", stated a male vampire as he entered the room and
stared at Buffy, "I assume you are the slayer the Master told us
about."</p>

<p>Buffy pulled her stake out and took a fighting stance, "Xander, Jesse
get behind me!"</p>

<p>The slayer was contemplating her plan of attack as several more
vampires poured into the room from a door to her left and from the
door the first vampire had entered through.  Buffy noticed out of the
corner of her eye on last passageway to the right, "Change of plan
guys!  Run for it!"</p>

<p>The trio made a break for the passageway and darted down a long
tunnel with several vampires in hot pursuit.  They came to another
intersection and saw three more vamps coming from the left and
another two blocking the way right in front of them.  </p>

<p>"Go right," screamed Buffy.</p>

<p>"I don't like this," shouted Xander.</p>

<p>"Neither do I!"</p>

<p>The tunnel curved to the right and they followed it, before them was
a large chamber with a door, "It's a dead end, what so we do now,"
Xander shouted in panic.</p>

<p>"Quick inside, we got to get this door shut it's are only chance,"
Buffy yelled, as her adrenaline kicked into overdrive.</p>

<p>The three of them rushed into the room and Buffy immediately started
working on closing the door.  Xander spotted a latter on the wall
that led to a manhole cover, "We can get out through that."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," snarled Jesse.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about," Xander Inquired.</p>

<p>"There is no escape from here, the master has seen to that," smirked
Jesse as his face transformed revealing his vampiric nature, "Now you
die."</p>

<p>"But we where friends."</p>

<p>"And now you are nothing but a shadow to me, I live only to serve the
master," growled Jesse as he rushed Xander.</p>

<p>Xander pulled the cross out of his pocket and held it up causing
Jesse to growl at him, "That can not save you!"</p>

<p>"But it will keep you away from me so Buffy can kick your butt."</p>

<p>"Will it," Jesse hissed striking Xander's arm and knocking the cross
from his hand.</p>

<p>Terror filled Xander's eyes as his one time friend lept on top of im
knocking him to the ground, "Buffy I need your help!"</p>

<p>Buffy rushed over to Xander and pulled Jesse of of Xander and through
him into the tunnel at the oncoming vampires.  She slammed the door
shut only to get one of the vampires arms got caught in it.  The
slayer pulled the door back and pushed the arm out before slamming
the door completely shut.  </p>

<p>Buffy sealed the door with the latch and turned to Xander, "Up the
ladder now!"</p>

<p>Xander shot up the ladder as the vampires pounded on the door.  Buffy
took a quick look at the door and saw that they where starting to
break through, "Hurry up, that door is not gonna last forever!"</p>

<p>Xander pushed at the man hole cover with all his strength and after a
second or so it gave and the light of day poured through the hole.</p>

<p>Buffy rushed up the latter as a vampire forced his hand through a
crack in the door and undid the latch.  She was almost out when she
felt a hand grab her ankle and start to pull her back down, "Xander I
need your help!"</p>

<p>Xander grabbed hold of Buffy and pulled her up, brining the vampires
hand into the sunlight.  The vampire screamed in pain as it released
Buffy.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>"She escaped!  The slayer walks free when I should be drinking her
heart's blood right now," The Master screamed</p>

<p>"Master, we had her trapped," exclaimed a male vampire.</p>

<p>"Oh, are you going to make excuses?"</p>

<p>The Master glared at the other vampire for a moment then
continued, "You are all weak.  It has been too long since you have
faced the Slayer.  It is no matter to me. She will not stop the
Harvest.  I just
mean there'll be someone worth killing, when I reach the surface.
Is Luke ready?"</p>

<p>"He waits."</p>

<p>"It's time.  Bring him to me."</p>

<p>After a few minutes the male vampire returned with Luke, the master
looked at him with contempt, "Colin, You failed me.  Tell me you're
sorry."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry!"</p>

<p>"There.  That wasn't so bad, was it?"</p>

<p>"No master."</p>

<p>"Good, come here."</p>

<p>The vampire approached the master and knelt before him.  The master
grabbed him by the head a rammed his finger through the vampires left
eye, "No one fails me!"  </p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>Willow's face lit up when Buffy and Xander walked into the
library, "Your back!"</p>

<p>Buffy walked over to her as Xander took a seat at the table.  The
slayer placed her hands on Willow's shoulders, "Yeah, I'm back just
like I said I would be."</p>

<p>"I'm glad."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled at Willow, she didn't know what she had done to deserve
this sweet girls trust and love but she was determined to make it
work, "Willow, I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"About what."</p>

<p>"Jesse."</p>

<p>"He was already dead?"</p>

<p>"No, they turned him, I was to late to save your friend."</p>

<p>Willow saw the tears forming in the blondes eyes, the slayers face
showed nothing but anguish over not being able to rescue Jesse.  </p>

<p>Willow wrapped her arms around Buffy and gently whispered in her to
her, "It wasn't your fault, there was nothing you could have done to
prevent it."</p>

<p>"I could have tried harder."</p>

<p>"Did you give it your all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it wasn't enough."</p>

<p>"Buffy, sometimes things happen, and there is nothing you can do to
prevent it.  What is important is that you came back to me safety,
just like you said you would."</p>

<p>Willow kept on of her arms around Buffy's waist, she let go with the
other and gently wiped the tears from the slayers cheek, "He was my
friend, but he is gone now and you are still here.  I want you to
know that no matter what happens, no matter how bad it gets, I'm
gonna be there for you."</p>

<p>Buffy leaned into Willow and rested her forehead on the Willow's
shoulder, "And I'll be there for you."</p>

<p>Giles looked over and saw Xander wiping his eyes, the boy looked at
him with a startled expression, "I got some dust in it OK!"</p>

<p>The watcher chuckled and went and took a seat at the table and waited
for Buffy and Willow to join them.</p>

<p>Buffy walked over to the table hoding Willow's hand, "So what did you
guys learn?"</p>

<p>Giles stood up and looked at the three youth, "This is what we know.
Some sixty years ago, a very old, very powerful vampire came to this
shore, not just to feed.</p>

<p>"He came 'cause this town's a mystical who's it," Buffy asked..</p>

<p>"Yes. The Spanish who first settled here called it 'Boca del
Infierno'. Roughly translated, 'Hellmouth'. It's a sort of, um,
portal between this reality and the next.  This vampire hopes to open
it."</p>

<p>"To bring the demons back?"</p>

<p>"But he blew it!  Or, I mean, there was an earthquake that swallowed
half the town, and him, too," replied Willow.</p>

<p>"You see, opening dimensional portals is a tricky business.  Odds are
he got himself stuck, rather like a, uh, cork in a bottle," added
Giles.</p>

<p>"And this Harvest thing is to get him out." Willow stated as she
rested her head against Buffy...</p>

<p>Giles stood up and walked over to the white board he had set up, " It
comes once in a century, on this night. The Master can draw power
from one of his minions while it feeds.  Enough power to break free
and open the portal.  The minion is called the Vessel, and he bears
this symbol.</p>

<p>Giles the drew a three pointed star on the white board and stepped
aside so everyone could see it.</p>

<p>Buffy started at the symbol, "So, I dust anyone sporting that symbol,
and no Harvest."</p>

<p>"Simply put, yes."</p>

<p>"Any idea where this little get-together is being held?"</p>

<p>"There, there are a number of possibilities."</p>

<p>"They're goin' to the Bronze," shouted Xander..</p>

<p>Willow gave her childhood friend a startled glance, "Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Come on.  All those tasty young morsels all over the place?  Anyway,
that's where Jesse's gonna be, trust me."</p>

<p>Giles grabbed his coat and looked at the others, "We had better leave
now, the sun will be down before long."</p>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<p>Cordelia and some of her friends where setting a on of the booths
making comments about how so out of touch some of the people in the
bronze where when the lights went out.  She looked around to see what
is happening and noticed a man making his way to the stage.</p>

<p>Luke walked up onto the stage and stared out across the hoard of
confused teenagers, a sinister smile crept across his face as he
vamped out, "Ladies and Gentlemen!  There is no cause for alarm.
Actually, there is cause for alarm. It just won't do any good."</p>

<p>Pandemonium broke loose on the dance for a several teenagers screamed
in horror.  </p>

<p>"This is a glorious night!  It is also the last one any of you shall
ever see.  Bring me the first," Like Hissed.</p>

<p>A vampire led the door attendant onto the stage and Luke grabbed him
by the throat, "Watch me, for fear is like an elixir.</p>

<p>Luke sunk his fangs into the door attendant's neck and drained him.
He dropped the lifeless corpse to the ground and screamed, "Bring me
another!"</p>

<p>Outside the Bonze Buffy and the others where frantically trying to
find away in.  They could hear the screams coming from inside, dread
filled the watcher's face, "We are to late it's begun."</p>

<p>Buffy kicked at the main door to the bronze but it didn't give, "You
guys try to find away in I'm gonna check the back door."</p>

<p>Luke had just finished draining another victim as Darla walked up to
Jesse.  She grabbed Cordelia by the arm and started to drag her away.</p>

<p>"She is mine," shouted Jesse.</p>

<p>"They all are for the master," coldly replied Darla.</p>

<p>Buffy crawled though an open window she had found in the back of the
bronze and quitly made her way to the upper level.  She walked over
to the edge of the balconly and spotted luke.</p>

<p>"I feel the Master's strength growing," growled the vampire, "I feel
him rising.  Every soul brings him closer!  I need another!"</p>

<p>Buffy glared at him, &lt;The Vessel&gt;.  She heard footsteps behind her
and spun around to see a vampire quickly approaching her position.</p>

<p>"Tonight is his ascension.  Tonight will be history at its end!
Yours is a glorious sacrifice!  Degradation most holy.  Bring me
another!"</p>

<p>"Here's a pretty one," replied Darla as she drug Cordelia on stage..</p>

<p>Luke carressed the screaming girls face and was preparing to claim
another for the master when a vampire landed in the middle of the
stage.  He looked up to the balconly and spotted Buffy.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry, were you in the middle of something," quiped the
slayer.</p>

<p>"You!"</p>

<p>"You didn't think I'd miss this. Did you?"</p>

<p>Buffy steps away from the railing, she did a flip off of the balcony
and land on a pool table.  She spotted a vampire rushing her from the
right and leapt from the table, grabbing a pool stick before she hit
the ground.  She then ran the stick through the oncoming vampire
reducing him to ashes. </p>

<p>Buffy then turned to the stage, "Okay, Vessel boy.  This parties
over."</p>

<p>"I will have your blood," Luke growled, tossing Cordelia of the stage.</p>

<p>"That's what all you bloodsuckers say," Buffy remarked, before doing
a cartwheel onto the stage.</p>

<p>Luke attacked the slayer with a series of punches but Buffy
successfully fended them of.  She then countered with a barrage of
jabs and kicks that the vampire managed to block.</p>

<p>Willow and the others burst through the back door that Xander had
managed to get open.  Giles quickly spotted the slayer and vessel
fighting on stage, "We have to get everyone out of here!"</p>

<p>As Buffy and Luke continued there fight Willow and the others where
directing the panicked teenagers out of the bronze.  </p>

<p>Xander spotted Jesse walking over to them and pulled a stake out.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't want to hurt a friend now would you."</p>

<p>"My friend is dead."</p>

<p>"I thought I was your friend."</p>

<p>"No you're a vampire, who just looks like someone I used to know,"
Replied Xander as he rammed the stake into the beast that used to be
Jesse.</p>

<p>Willow and Giles where helping the last of the teenagers out of the
club when Darla hit her from behind knocking her down.  Willow rolled
over on her back and saw the vampire getting ready to pounce on her.
She pulled the holy water Buffy had given her and tossed it in the
creatures face.</p>

<p>Darla clutched her face and howled in pain before running off into
the night.  Willow stood back up and turned to the stage, she was the
vessel hit Buffy across the face and watched in horror as the blonde
fell backwards onto the floor.</p>

<p>Even as Buffy did a back-flip and regained her composure Willow was
rushing towards the stage.  The redhead wasn't thinking clearly, all
she knew was that Buffy had been hit and that the vampire was getting
the upper hand.  </p>

<p>Willow screamed as she got close to the stage and a vampire grabbed
her from behind.  </p>

<p>Buffy glanced over and saw that Willow was in trouble, she felt like
her heart was about to explode.  </p>

<p>Grabbed a cymbal off of the drums set on stage, "Willow!  Duck!"</p>

<p>Willow looked up at the stage and saw Buffy holding the cymbal, she
lowered her head and hoped the blonde knew what she was doing.</p>

<p>Buffy threw the cymbal straight at the vampire, it went sailing
through the air at the creature and decapitated him on impact.  Buffy
breathed a sigh of relief as Willow safety fell to the ground.</p>

<p>Luke saw what was happening and deiced to take advantage of the
slayer being distracted.  He rushed over to her and grabbed Buffy
from behind, "I've always wanted to kill a slayer." </p>

<p>Buffy arched back and head-butted the vampire breaking his grip and
sending him reeling backwards, "I hate to disappoint you but I made a
promise I have got to keep." </p>

<p>"Nice trick, but it's not gonna be enough," the vampire snapped.</p>

<p>"Well then how about this," Buffy said, lifting up a microphone stand
and preparing to throw it.</p>

<p>"Foolish slayer, have you forgotten, metal can not harm me?"</p>

<p>"No but you did forget about one thing."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Sunlight," Buffy replied.</p>

<p>She threw the stand like a javelin sending it soaring over the
vampires head and crashing through a Window.  Luke shielded his face
and screamed as the light poured in.  After a few seconds he realized
it was only a street light and stood upright.</p>

<p>Luke turned back to the slayer, and felt her stake penetrate his
chest, he stumbled of the edge of the stage and exploded into ashes.</p>

<p>Buffy walked over to where Luke fell and looked at the pile of dust
on the ground, "It's in nine hours moron."</p>

<p>The slayer hopped of the stage and rushed over to Willow as the
remaining vampires scattered into the night, "Are you OK."</p>

<p>"Yeah, you?"</p>

<p>"I'm fine, Buffy replied, reaching down to help Willow up.</p>

<p>"Did we win?"</p>

<p>"The vessels defeated and the harvest stopped."</p>

<p>Willow smiled at Buffy, "Good, but what happens now?"</p>

<p>"I did promise you that I would tell you about me becoming a slayer,
and I was thinking maybe I could do that tomorrow over lunch, if you
don't mind that is."</p>

<p>"Buffy are you asking me out on a date," coyly replied Willow.</p>

<p>The slayer nevously kicked the heel of her left foot, "Y-yes."</p>

<p>"Then I accept, I just hope that it is…"</p>

<p>"Is what?"</p>

<p>"The first of many."</p>

<p>Buffy wrapped her arms around Willow and pulled the redhead into an
embrace, "I see know problem with that."</p>

<p>Willow returned the embrace and buried her head in Buffy's
shoulder, "I wish this moment would never end."</p>

<p>"It doesn't have to, at least not right away," answered Buffy as she
laid a tender kiss on Willows forehead.</p>

<p>Xander looked at his friends as they tightly held on to one another,
and hoped that sometime he would find someone to love as they loved
each other.  He gathered his composure and turned to Giles, "What do
we do now?"</p>

<p>"We let them have this moment."

 Xander walked over and joined the watcher at the table and waited
for his friends to join them.</p>

<p>Outside the Bronze Angel watched as the last of the vampires
retreated into the night, "I don't believe it, she won."</p>

<p>"What's not to believe," said a familiar voice from the shadows.</p>

<p>Angel turned around and looked at the demon that he was now
facing, "Whistler, what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"I was sent to see that you where OK."</p>

<p>"I'm fine."</p>

<p>"No you are not, you gave the warning that you where suppose to, but
did not aid in there cause."</p>

<p>"The slayer has made friends and found her soulmate, there is nothing
I can do to help."</p>

<p>"You are wrong, the harvest was stopped but the Master still is.
They will need your help if the two if them are to survive the coming
days."</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Read this then give it to the watcher," replied Whistler.</p>

<p>"What is it," asked Angel as he took the book.</p>

<p>"It is the Codex."</p>
