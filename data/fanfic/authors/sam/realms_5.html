<!-- Realms \ Part 4 -->

<p>Buffy walked into the dorm room and saw Willow sitting on the edge of
her bed, the
red heads eyes seemed to be filled with bliss as she smiled and
motioned for Buffy to come join her. The slayer walked over to her
friend wondering what was going on,
"Hi Wills, what's up?."</p>

<p>Willow looked up at her and patted the bed to indicate she wanted
Buffy to sit next to her, "Have a seat Buffy, I need to talk to you."</p>

<p>After Buffy had sat down Willow grabbed her hand, and looked the
blonde in the eyes, "Do you believe in destiny?"</p>

<p>"I'm the slayer, destiny is practically my middle name," Buffy
replied. She then paused for a moment pondering what was going
on, "Willow, what`s happening here?"</p>

<p>"I really don't know where to begin. I guess the best place would be
that Me and Tara are now officially only just friends, whatever we
had before is over."</p>

<p>Buffy couldn't find the words to say to Willow. She wasn't sure what
had happened between the two Wiccan but knew that most likely her
friend was hurting. On one hand she was upset that something had
happened to end Willows relationship with Tara causing the beautiful
red head pain, but in the other hand she was secretly jumping for joy
now that Tara appeared to be out of the picture as far as Willow`s
love life went. Maybe she had a chance, maybe Willow could love her
like she loved Willow.</p>

<p>Willow waited for Buffy's reply but got none, she looked into the
slayers light blue eyes and saw a mixture of emotions. There was
confusion, doubt, hopefulness, but mostly there was love. She felt
tears began to form as she realized how true Tara's words had been,
Buffy loved her, they were meant to be together.</p>

<p>Willow moved closer to the slayer, as she did she could hear Buffy's
heart rapidly pulsating, she wrapped her arm around Buffy and
tenderly pulled the slayer towards her. Buffy gazed over at Willow,
her voice filled with confusion and excitement, "OK this is nice but
you still haven't answered me, what's going on?"</p>

<p>Willow sweetly smiled at her, "The reason we broke up was that we
simply were simply not meant to be together, My heart belongs.....to
you."</p>

<p>Buffy felt a wave of joy sweep over her as she finally heard the
words she had yearned to hear for over a year. Tears rolled down her
cheeks as she took Willow in her arms, she tried to speak, tried to
tell Willow how much she loved her but the words were drowned in a
sea of joy and happiness. All she could do is rest her head on the
red heads shoulder and softly sob as all her hopes and dreams came
true.</p>

<p>Willow gently kissed Buffy on the forehead as she ran her fingers
through the slayers hair, "I love you."</p>

<p>The slayer looked up and gazed into Willows eyes, "I love you too."</p>

<p>Willow reached over and brushed the tears from Buffy's eyes, she then
leaned over placing a tender kiss against the slayers soft lips.
Buffy felt her heart miss a beat as Willows lips pressed against
hers, after the kiss was over she found herself longing for more so
she pulled Willow down on the bed beside her and affectionately
returned the Kiss as the two of them held each other in a loving
embrace. </p>

<p>Tara sat at her desk, she knew she had done the right thing but that
knowledge did little to comfort her from the pain that was eating at
her heart. She got up and was about to go to bed when a voice spoke
to her, "Child I know you are in great pain but there is something
that requires your immediate attention"</p>

<p>Tara looked around and saw the room was empty, she knew that Fey was
contacting her telepathically from the Ethereal. She closed her eyes
and sent back a reply,
 "What."</p>

<p>"A great darkness is coming and all their lives are in danger."</p>

<p>"What is this darkness, whose lives?"</p>

<p>"A powerful warlock named Ciarán has emerged, he seeks to gain the
power of the Hellmouth. He is a great threat to the slayer and all
those who care for her, you must go and contact the watcher before it
is to late."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>In the Ethereal the warrior Alexandria and her soulmate Sabryn looked
down upon the slayer and her newfound love as they cuddled up against
one another in their slumber.. Sabryn turned to the blonde
immortal, "They have found on another, it seems that Fey's talk with
the Tara worked."</p>

<p>Alexandria smiled as she returned the red heads glance, "Yes, and now
it is time for us to visit them so the slayers full potential can be
released."</p>

<p>Moments later in the dream world......</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow stood hand in hand in the middle of a rich green
meadow, off to their right was a babbling brook with two women
standing next to it. One of the women was a blonde wearing chain
mail armor, with a sheathed sword at her side. The other was a red
head wearing blue robes and carrying a staff. The blond women
motioned for Buffy and Willow to come join them, "Come Slayer we have
much to talk about."</p>

<p>Buffy protectively wrapped an arm around Willow, "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"We are friends of Morgan Le Fey, I am called Alexandria and this is
my beloved Sabryn." answered the Blond.</p>

<p>Buffy looked at Alexandria, her face clearly showing the shock the
woman's name had caused, "Are you the same Alexandria that was in
book Fey gave Giles, the one who calls the slayers."</p>

<p>"Yes"</p>

<p>"Why have you brought us here."</p>

<p>"Do you remember when the first slayer came to talk to you."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Buffy wondering where this was going.</p>

<p>"Do you recall how you were told that you have not yet become all you
were meant to be?"</p>

<p>Buffy nodded her head as she clung to Willow.</p>

<p>"The time has come to correct that, you and your beloved were brought
here so that your true potential could be unleashed."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Giles sat starring at the young blond who sat at the table accrosed
from him, his hands were visibly shaking as a result of the message
she had brought. Ciarán after all these years had reemerged. He
shuttered at the thought of the warlock who once lead the dark coven
of his youth of getting anywhere near Sunnydale. He thought about
the last time his past had returned when Ethan Rayne came to town and
tried to ruin their lives, but this was different, Ciarán was more
powerful than any witch or warlock he had ever encountered. While
Ethan had been essentially evil Ciarán made him look like a
boyscout. Giles let out a sigh of desperation, what were they to do,
how could they a warlock so powerful that those who followed him
called him master. </p>
