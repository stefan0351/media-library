<!-- Realms \ Part 2 -->

<p>Willow sat within the circle gazing at Tara, her mind kept playing
Fey's words over and over, &lt;It is not met to be&gt;. A tear rolled down
Willow's cheek as she continued to wait for the blonde witch to come
out of the trance, What was happening with them, why did her vision
tell her Tara was not the one and nothing more. </p>

<p>Fey watched as Tara tried to avoid looking at her, "Child look at me
when I am speaking."</p>

<p>"S-s-sorry," replied Tara as she made eye contact with Fey.</p>

<p>"Did you forget why you were sent?"</p>

<p>"No." replied Tara, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>

<p>"Then could you refresh my memory, because it sure looks like you did
to me"</p>

<p>Tara lowered her head and looked at her feet as she began to
speak, "I was s-sent..."</p>

<p>Fey cut Tara off in mid-sentence, "I told you to look at me when you
are talking."</p>

<p>Tara lifted her head back up and continued, "To help the Willow," Fey
could barely hear Tara as she finished off the rest of the
sentence, "and the slayer."</p>

<p>Fey frowned at the girl when she saw that Tara was done speaking, "I
see that not only are you conveniently leaving off the rest of the
instructions I gave you when you where sent to outer earth from the
ethereal but you have altered them to the point where the slayer has
become a side note."</p>

<p>Fey then walked over to Tara and put her hand on the girls
shoulder, "Listen to me child, I have know your mother for a very
long time and you are like a daughter to me, but I can not permit you
this to continue any longer. You have permitted yourself fall in
love with the Wicca knowing that she is met for another and the time
has come for that to be corrected." </p>

<p>Fey paused for a moment and place her hand under Tara's chin, lifting
her head up so she could look the blonde directly in they eyes, "I am
afraid that no matter how much it pains you that you must fix what
you have broken and then work to accomplish what you were sent to do."</p>

<p>"B-b-but I l-l-love Willow."</p>

<p>"I know but you were sent to aid the slayer, to help her find the
love that she so desperately needs to make her whole."</p>

<p>Fey paused for a second to make sure that Tara was paying full
attention to her and when she was sure the girl was she continued, "I
told you before you even entered outer earth who it was that could
complete the slayer however you chose to ignore that and allowed
yourself to fall for her, creating a relationship that is breaking
the slayers heart." </p>

<p>Tara hung her head in shame knowing that everything Fey had said was
true. Tears started to freely flow down the blondes face as she
thought about what had to be done. "H-h-ow can I......make t-things
right?"</p>

<p>"I'm am afraid that there is only one way, you reveal everything.
Take the Wicca to the watcher and tell the two of them of your
mission, the nature of the Realms, and why this particular slayer is
more important than any other slayer before her. After you have
told them take the Wicca aside and reveal to the feelings the slayer
has for her and how she is the one who holds the key to the slayers
heart."</p>

<p>Tara nodded her head then softly asked, "After I have done all of
this will I be allowed to return home."</p>

<p>"I am afraid not child, you must then finish what you started."</p>

<p>"I don't understand what you're saying?"</p>

<p>"You have taken it upon yourself to help the Wicca how to unlock and
channel the magic that resides in her. Her powers can be of great
benefit to both the slayer and her, so you must continue to aid her
in reaching her full potential, but at the same time you must ensure
that you do not interfere with her relationship with the slayer."</p>

<p>Tara went to speak only to find herself sitting accrosed from
Willow. The redhead leaned over and wrapped her arms around
Tara. "I see you finally decided to come back to me," replied Willow
just before she placed a gentle kiss on the blondes forehead.</p>

<p>Tara jerked back and Willow could see that Tara was crying, "What's
wrong?"</p>

<p>Tara stared at Willow, she knew what she had to do and it was eating
away at her, "W-w-w-we have g-got to talk, but w-we have to go to G-g-giles first."</p>

<p>Willow wasn't sure what was going on with Tara but something deep
inside her was told her that her vision was fulfilling itself and
that her and Tara were nearing the end of their romance. "It's
getting late, can out wait till tomorrow?" asked Willow trying to
hold on to whatever it was that she and Tara had.</p>

<p>Tara gazed at Willow and smiled, "Yeah, it can wait till tomorrow,"
she replied </p>

<p>Buffy and Faith walked through the Northridge cemetery on there
nightly patrol. So far it had been a pretty uneventful night with
only three newly turned vampires deciding to show themselves.</p>

<p>So B, you five by five?"</p>

<p>"Not really ."</p>

<p>"What's up?"</p>

<p>"For one thing I just finished talking to Giles, who showed me a
rather interesting book."</p>

<p>Faith cringed and then replied, "It wasn't another one of those
pesky prophecies again was it?"</p>

<p>Buffy smiled when she heard Faith's question, recalling her reaction
when Giles had brought the book out earlier that day, "No it was
nothing like that. It was more like a history lesson on Hell's
mouths, vampires, and slayers."</p>

<p>Faith cringed again, "Ouch, history is even worst than prophecy."</p>

<p>Buffy couldn't help but laugh at the brunette, "I tend to agree, but
I did learn one thing that was very interesting."</p>

<p>"Go ahead B, spill it."</p>

<p>"You know that spirit guide I told you about this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, what about here," replied Faith, wondering where Buffy was
going with this.</p>

<p>"Giles thinks that she might be the one who wrote the slayer history
book he has."</p>

<p>"Interesting, so what does he think that means?:"</p>

<p>"Well he is not really sure but wants me to ask her when I see her
again."</p>

<p>After they had finished telling Faith about what was in the book the
slayers existed the Northridge cemetery and stated to make their way
towards South Pines cemetery to continue their patrol. </p>

<p>Willow walked into her and Buffy's dorm room still wondering what was
going on between her and Tara. She placed her backpack on her desk
and went over laid down on her bed, and closed her eyes hoping that
somehow she might be able to talk to this woman calling herself Fey
in her dreams.</p>

<p>"I heard you calling me in your dream state young Wicca"</p>

<p>Willow spun around as soon as she heard the voice, coming face to
face with the mysterious woman that she had encountered
earlier. "What's happening with Tara and me."</p>

<p>"What was not suppose to be is being undone."</p>

<p>"What's that suppose to mean?"</p>

<p>"As I told you in the vision, you and Tara are not met to be."</p>

<p>Willow's eyes filled with sorrow at Fey's words, "We both care for
one another, why can't it be?"</p>

<p>Fey walked over to Willow and put her hands on the redheads
shoulders, "Young Wicca when we last spoke you said that you have
been unlucky in the area of romance, is that correct."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you know why?"</p>

<p>Willow looked at Fey, wondering were this mysterious woman was taking
the conversation, "No, why?"</p>

<p>"Because you have yet to find your one true love, that special person
whose heart you hold the key to," Fey then paused for a second and
sighed, "Sadly the one you are met to be with has been by your side
for a long time now but the two of you have been unable to find one
another."</p>

<p>Willow woke up from her dream state wishing that Fey would have told
her who her this one true love was but the woman wouldn`t tell her
but instead had promised that soon her one true love would be
revealed. Willow sat up in her bed and allowed her eyes to adjust to
the dimly light dorm room. She knew now that she was going to loose
Tara but for some reason it did not hurt as bad as she thought it
would. Her mind recalled what Fey had said, &lt;There was someone out
there that she was met to be, someone who would fulfill her, make her
happy, someone who would love her like she deserved to be loved.&gt;
Willow looked at the empty bed on the other side of the room, &lt;She
did say that it was someone who had been by my side for a long time&gt;
she began to smile as she thought about her best friend and
protector, &lt;could I be that lucky.&gt;</p>

<p>Buffy and Faith had just reached the UC Sunnydale campus and were on
the final leg of the patrol when the brunette looked over at her
friend and fellow slayer, "So B, what is really bothering you, and
none of this I was just thinking about what Giles said today crap."</p>

<p>Buffy knew her fellow slayer was headed so she made an effort to side
step the issue, "Faith I honestly don't know what your talking about,
by the way have you heard the new Wallflowers CD yet."</p>

<p>Faith stopped dead and her tracks and stared Buffy dead in the
eyes, "I've been friends with you long enough to know better than
that B. I'm not about to fall for your little if I change the
subject she will forget about what we were talking about maneuver.
So I'm going to ask you again, what the hell is going on with you?"</p>

<p>Buffy looked at Faith and saw that the brunette wasn't going to drop
the issue, "It's about Willow and Tara?"</p>

<p>Faith saw the hurt that engulfed her friend as soon as she mentioned
the couple, "B, your jealous, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"It's worse than that, I'm in love with Willow."</p>

<p>"Have you told her."</p>

<p>"No, I can't. She's with Tara, she's happy, I can`t risk taking away
her happiness."</p>

<p>"Something tells me you could make her happy," Smirked Faith, "You
should tell her."</p>

<p>Buffy gave Faith an awkward smile then spoke, "Let's finish up patrol
so I can get back to the dorm and you can get back to Giles," after
she had finished speaking the slayer thought to herself, as long as
Willow is with Tara there is no way I'm going to tell her how I feel.</p>

<p>Ciarán stood on the outskirts of town his dark red eyes locked on the
sign that read Welcome to Sunnydale California. A wicked sneer
spread accrosed his face as he tossed a half smoked cigarette to the
ground and crushed under the heel an Armani boot. He then waved his
hand through the air and laughed as he watched the sign melt before
his eyes. </p>
