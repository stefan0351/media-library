<!-- Legend \ Chapter 13: Blessed Protector -->

<p>Buffy sat down in a empty chair as soon as she and the
others returned from their patrol. As soon as she was
seated Willow was in her lap, curling up against the
slayer and gently kissing her on the cheek before
resting her head on the Buffy’s shoulder. Xander went
and sat on the floor off to the side off the room next
to Anya who immediately snuggled up against him, glad
to see that he had returned unharmed. The rest of the
patrol went and took seat around the table in the
middle of the room to talk with Collin and Hughes
about tonight's events. As they did Buffy and Willow
both noticed that Cordelia got up from the chair she
was sitting in and went over taking a seat next to
Angel. Both the girls looked at her as she slid the
chair she had taken as close to the brooding vampires
seat as she could get, they then looked at one
another, their minds filled with curiosity over the
scene that was playing out before them. &lt;What‘s going
on with those two.&gt;</p>

<p>"Giles how did the patrol go," asked Collin.</p>

<p>"It was rather uneventful. We didn’t see a single
vampire, it would appear that for now Vlad Tepes has
become completely silent but unfortunately with the
likes of him silence can be deadly." Giles paused for
a second then continued, "There is one other thing."</p>

<p>"Go ahead."</p>

<p>"We went to the mansion to see if we could gain any
information only to find that it had been abandoned
and that a message had been left for us."</p>

<p>Buffy tightened her embrace around Willow as Giles
relayed the message that Vlad Tepes had left behind.
Everyone in the room just sat there for a few moments
after the watcher had spoken, there were no words for
what all of them were felling, for the first time
since his arrival the master vampyre was making his
intentions clear, Vlad Tepes wanted them all dead.</p>

<p>Eamonn sat in a plain brown robe in the middle of the
circle that he had drawn on the floor and began to
chant, </p>

<p align=center>"Earth beneath me, Sustainer of Life;<br>
Air around me, Inspiring all Life;<br>
Fire of Stars above me, Empowerment of Life;<br>
Water within me, Refreshing of Life."</p>

<p>After he had finished centering himself Eamonn slowly
arose and stepped out of the circle, he looked around
the warehouse that had been his home since he had
arrived at the Hellsmouth, then walked over to his
makeshift sleeping area and began to gather his
belongings, &lt;Tonight he would reveal myself to those
who have been called.&gt;</p>

<p>Collin looked directly at Angel, we have discovered
something about your friend Eamonn"</p>

<p>Angels eyes were filled with curiosity as he inquired
about the mysterious man who had saved him, "What did
you find?"</p>

<p>"First the name Eamonn comes from the Irish Gaelic, it
means Blessed Protector. Second the symbol that you
described to us," As Collin spoke he picked up the
open book that laid in front of him and place it
before Angel, "is that it."</p>

<p>Angel looked down at the book and saw the familiar
symbol that had been on all the walls of the abandoned
warehouse, "Yes, what is it?"</p>

<p>"It is called a Sigil, and it is believed to bring
powerful magic. Though no one knows for certain what
kind of magic. Every reference we found on it seems
to indicate that it might be used for protection and
or banishment."</p>

<p>Willow looked up at the men at the table and
interjected, "What a second, I’m a witch and know
something about magic, pentagrams are used in
protection spells."</p>

<p>Collin turned to Willow, "Nowadays for a Wiccan such
as yourself that is quite true, however the Sigil was
used in the ancient lands of the Celts by Druids. I‘m
not sure exactly what all of this means, it only seems
to make this Eamonn more of a mystery."</p>

<p>Buffy looked at Collin, "What because he is most
likely a Druid?"</p>

<p>Collin looked at the slayer but spoke to Willow,
"Should I tell her or do you wish to elaborate?"</p>

<p>Willow took her head up off of Buffy’s shoulder and
looked her love in the eyes, "There hasn’t been any
known Druids in a very long time."</p>

<p>"How long," asked Buffy not sure if she was gong to
like the answer or not.</p>

<p>"I’m not really sure," Replied Willow as she looked
over to the table for help.</p>

<p>Collin looked at the two girls, "The last records of
any one having contact with the Druids dates to right
around the turn of the first millennium, almost a
thousand years ago."</p>

<p>Vlad looked out across the main room of his new lair,
"Look at them William, my new children," He said as he
gazed at the fifty plus vampires that just one night
ago had been residents of the Sunnydale homeless
shelter.</p>

<p>"Yes master their number is impressive, but they are
newly reason the slayer and witch might be able to
finish them off quickly."</p>

<p>"I know, that is why I will send some of them out but
only enough to occupy the two girls as we continue to
build our numbers. Newly risen vampires are no match
for the two, so we must overwhelm them with a
numerically superior force. And When I have enough
children to do that I will strike and we will have our
vengeance as I stand over a dead slayer."</p>

<p>"And what of the Witch"</p>

<p>"With her love gone she will no longer care as I drain
her life force from her, then and only then will my
rage be satisfied."</p>

<p>Vlad then stepped forward towards his children with a
sinister grin crossed his face. The master vampyre’s
eyes filled with pure hatred for the witch and her
slayer as he spoke, "Soon My children the new order
will begin, nothing will stop me this time. They can
not win."</p>

<p>The mid afternoon sun brought sorrow as they headed
back towards their cars leaving the cemetery behind.
Buffy helped Willow back to her mom’s car as the
redhead silently wept. They were followed By Joyce
and Giles who were helping a sobbing Shelia Rosenberg
to the same care. Buffy looked at her lover as she
opened the door for the redhead, the next few days
were going to be hard for Willow, not only did she
have to mourn the passage of her dad but Vlad Tepes
was getting ready for something major. The slayer
shivered as she thought about what Giles had told her,
shortly before they were to leave for the funeral he
and Collin had learned that the entire populous of
the homeless shelter had mysteriously vanished in the
night, and in the Hellsmouth with Vlad Tepes running
around that could only mean one thing.</p>

<p>Eamonn walked out the doors of warehouse wearing the
same black suite he had worn when he rescued Angel, on
his back was the small pack that contained all his
worldly possessions. He watched as the sun slowly
made it’s decent into the western horizon, &lt;the light
was giving way to darkness and soon Vlad Tepes would
roam the Hellsmouth.&gt; He began to walk towards the
campus were he knew those who had been called would be
headed, &lt;It is time to be revealed.&gt;</p>

<p>No one really felt like going out on patrol especially
Willow and Buffy. It had been a long day, The slayer
had spent most of it comforting Willow and giving her
love a shoulder to cry on. She knew that Willow was
hurting, she could feel it deep inside her and see it
in her loves eyes. Seeing Willow hurting like this
tore her up inside, &lt;Master vampyre or not your going
to pay for this.&gt; She wrapped her arms around Willow
and kissed her on the forehead, "Are you sure you want
to go out tonight, maybe you should stay her with your
mom." Buffy said as she looked over in Shelia’s
direction. </p>

<p>Willow leaned into Buffy and rested her head on the
slayers shoulder, "No, you need me, and I need to be
there for you. Besides Mom has your Mom, Cordelia,
Anya, Megan, and the others to be there for her why
we're out."</p>

<p>"Your sure?" Asked Buffy </p>

<p>Willow stepped back from Buffy and took the blonde by
the hand , "I’m sure"</p>

<p>Buffy then turned to the rest of the group, "You
guys ready to roll."</p>

<p>Xander gave Anya a hug before heading towards the door
and Cordelia walked up to Angel and gave him a hug,
which the not so brooding vampire returned followed by
a very quick and light kiss on the cheek. Angel then
turned to a Buffy noticing the look of curiosity on
her face as she absorbed what had just happened, "I’m
ready," he replied, hoping Buffy didn’t ask him what
was going on because he wasn’t sure himself, all he
really knew was that his feelings for Cordelia were
rapidly changing.</p>

<p>They had made it half way to the campus when five
vampires jumped out from the bushes. Buffy leapt
into action before anyone else in the group could
react. She struck one of the vamps hard on the chin
with an upper cut knocking him to the ground. Another
vamp to a swing at her only to have his punch caught
and get flipped threw the air. She then leg swept one
before catching another with a round house. The
remaining standing vamp rushed at her only to find a
stake rammed into his chest as he got there. She then
quickly staked two of the vamps as they got back up of
the ground. Buffy connected with a round house with
the vamp that had just gotten to his feet to her left
sending him back to the ground. She then staked the
other vamp as after she flipped him to the ground for
a second time. The slayer then kicked the remaining
vamp in the head as he got to his knees sending him
rolling to his back before she finished him off. She
looked at the five piles of dust on the ground,
"That’s for what your master did to my Willow."</p>

<p>Vlad and Spike made their way from the moving van and
started walking towards one of the many dormitories
on the UC Sunnydale campus wearing the police uniforms
they had gotten from two of his newly risen children.
Quickly they made their way inside, and headed for the
first door on the floor. The master vampire turned to
his prodigy, "I believe this will do nicely," He said
as he began to knock on the door. When a young woman
answered the master vampyre smiled at her, "We have
few questions we need to ask, May We come in."</p>

<p>About a half mile from the campus Buffy stopped dead
in her tracks. The slayer let go off Willows hand and
stepped in front of her love, "You guys better get
ready."</p>

<p>The ten vampires that were walking down the road
towards them charged when they saw the Witch and the
Slayer had stopped. Buffy and the slayers in training
took fighting stances getting ready for the onslaught
when Willow tapped her lover on the shoulder. Buffy
turned to the Willow and the redhead spoke, "My turn."</p>

<p>Willow stepped up beside Buffy and pointed at the on
coming vampires with her right hand. Suddenly a
column of flame shot down from the sky and immediately
consumed the vampires. Buffy looked at her beloved
and took her in her arms, "Did I tell you I love
you.," Said the slayer before her lips pressed up
against Willows.</p>

<p>Tristin looked at Kathryn then the two watchers,
"Excuse me Mr. Giles."</p>

<p>"Yes, what is it," replied Giles.</p>

<p>"Do you get the feeling that we aren’t really needed"</p>

<p>Giles thought for a moment as he watched Willow and
Buffy break their kiss and once again take each others
hands. He then honestly answered the slayer in
training, "I’m beginning to, but the last two attacks
were no were on the level they had been. Also the way
the vampires reacted to us was very reckless they most
likely are very young if not newly risen. That
however will not be the case when we have to face Vlad
Tepes." </p>

<p>Vlad and Spike tossed the last couple of recruits in
the back of the van from the second dorm they had
visited. The master vampyre looked at the blonde
vampire, "This is turning out rather nicely, a few
more building like this one and we should be more than
ready to begin the move against the Witch and Slayer."
He then shut the door to the moving van, "William
shall we go find another."</p>

<p>"Yes Master," replied Spike before walking around the
corner of the van towards the drivers seat.</p>

<p>The patrol was almost to the campus when a group of
seven vamps stepped out from behind some trees. Buffy
pulled Mr. Pointy from her jacket and took a fighting
stance, just then all seven vampires turned to dust.
The slayer turned to Willow, "Way to go, I think I owe
you another kiss."</p>

<p>Willow smiled at Buffy, "I’ll take the kiss but it
wasn’t me."</p>

<p>Buffy looked at the group and saw that they were just
as perplexed as she was, "What’s going on here"</p>

<p>Before anyone could respond a male voice spoke from
behind her, "Maybe I can explain"</p>

<p>Buffy spun around to see a young man step out from the
tress, she looked at him for a moment then inquired,
"Who are you."</p>

<p>The man smiled at her, "I am Eamonn, and I can see by
the look on your faces that all of you have several
questions for me. Where would you like to begin?"</p>
