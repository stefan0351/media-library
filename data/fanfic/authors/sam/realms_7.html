<!-- Realms \ Part 6 -->

<p>Time seemed to be standing still for Willow as she waited for Buffy
to return from patrol, she anxiously paced back and forth across
their room, periodically glancing at the door. In the past she had
always worried about the slayer when she was out on parole but now
that they had discovered one another that worry was ten times
greater. Willow could feel here heart pounding rhythmically with the
ticking of the clock, each beat indicating another second that her
new love was out amongst the darkness and away from her.'</p>

<p>As soon as Buffy walked into her room Willows arms were tightly
wrapped around her. Buffy then smiled as she affectionately embraced
Willow, "I take it that you missed me."</p>

<p>"Yeah, plus I was worried about you." </p>

<p>"Well I'm here now, so there's no need to worry," Buffy
then
tenderly assaulted Willows lips with a barrage of affectionate kisses.</p>

<p>After both girls regained there breath Buffy took Willow by the hand
and led the red head over to her bed. She then sat down and pulled
Willow onto her lap, wrapping her arms around her loves waste in the
process. "Have I told you recently how much I love you,"
replied
Buffy, her voice filled with passion.</p>

<p>Smiling Willow rested her head up against Buffy's shoulder,
"Yeah,
right before you left for parole."</p>

<p>"Well then I have got some time to make up for, that's
entirely to
long," replied Buffy with a mischievous smile. The slayer then
leaned over and flipped the light switch. </p>

<p>Meanwhile on the other side of Sunnydale..............</p>

<p>The cold body of his victim laid at Ciarán's feet as he stood
before
the Hellmouth,
"Tursa , ruler of destruction and creator of evil I evoke thy
ancient
name, grant me entrance unto the Realm of Demons." </p>

<p>As Ciarán's spoke a red cloud of smoke began to pour from the
base of
the Hellmouth and the earth began to shake. Then a bright blue
light shined from the expanding crack in the earth, and he could feel
the dark power behind the Hellmouth begin to envelope him, soon he
would be unstoppable, soon the world itself would bow before him.</p>

<p>A messenger burst into the meeting chamber of the tribunal of mages
within the void. The twelve mages of the council looked at the young
messenger and saw the despair that filled his face, "What news do
ye
bring," inquired Catalina, the head of the Tribunal.</p>

<p>Panic filled the messengers voice as he stood before the mages,
"A
warlock is attempting to open a Hellmouth."</p>

<p>Upon hearing the news the mages quickly gathered around the large
crystal in the center of the chamber, they then all inner locked
their hands forming a circle. As the mages began focusing their
Psionic energy onto the crystal they could see Ciarán performing
his
dark magic. They increased their energies concentrating on the
rapidly opening Hellmouth.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Ciarán clenched his fist as he gazed at what was now nothing more
than a crack in the earth, he bent over and moved his hand over the
closed Hellmouth, the power that was almost his was still trapped
behind it. Hatred filled his eyes as he turned to Ethan, "It was
suppose to have been mine."</p>

<p>Ethan's voice was laced with fear as he addressed the enraged
warlock, "What happened my master?"</p>

<p>"Someone powerful in the magic arts has moved against me, and
prevented the opening of the Hellmouth."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, but I intend to find out, and when I do I will
destroy them and then make the power of the Hellmouth mine."</p>

<p>Ciarán then walked over to the stairs, "I require information
on who
might be powerful enough to break my spell. Come Ethan, we have an
old friend to visit."</p>

<p>Joyce leaned up against Giles as the two of them sat on the couch
curiously watching the Brunette slayer seated across from them.
"You
said you have to talk to us about Buffy," inquired a very
concerned
Rupert Giles.</p>

<p>"Yeah, well B probably could explain what happened tonight
better,
but she said it could wait till morning, something about getting home
to Willow and.."</p>

<p>Giles quickly cut of Faith in mid sentence, "Uh, That's quite
enough
information on why Buffy's not here, could you please get back to
what you where originally talking about."</p>

<p>Joyce removed her head from Giles shoulder and leaned forward on the
couch, "Faith, Rupert is quite right, what happened tonight with
my
daughter."</p>

<p>"Well it's kinda like this. It was sorta a busy night, you
know lots
of vamps out. G-man the way B slayed them was amazing."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by amazing?"</p>

<p>"It's kinda hard to explain."</p>

<p>"Well try"</p>

<p>"For one thing she moved faster than I thought possible. I mean
she
was moving from one vamp to another before they knew what hit them.
Then there was her strength, I mean I know B is pretty strong but
this was different."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by different?"</p>

<p>"G, I saw her rip the head off of one of the vamps and throw
another
one twenty feet through the air like he was a stuffed toy."</p>

<p>Giles got up and started pacing back and forth as he pondered what
all of this meant. Faith got up and stood in front of him in order
to stop his pacing, "G, you might want to sit back down.
There's
more and it's a biggie."</p>

<p>Giles rejoined Joyce on the couch, then looked to Faith., "OK,
I'm
sitting, go ahead."</p>

<p>"She somehow was throwing vamps around without even touching them
or
being close to them, I swear one time I think I saw her dust a vamp
by giving him a dirty look."</p>

<p>Before Giles could reply to what Faith had just said there was a
rather loud knock at the door. He got up of the couch and kissed
Joyce on the forehead, "I`ll be right back," he then
quickly glanced
at Faith before heading towards the door, "As soon as I get back
I
have several questions for you."</p>

<p>Joyce and Faith both waited as Giles went to answer the door,
suddenly they heard him scream out in terror, "Oh my God. Joyce,
Faith. Run, get out of here now!"</p>
