<!-- Legend \ Chapter 10: Reign of Terror -->

<p>Vlad stood there in front of the remnants of the burnt
out magic shop, as he watched the red and blue
flashing lights from a police cruiser rapidly
approach.  The car came to a halting stop in front of
the store and two officers jumped out with their guns
pointed at Vlad and his children, “Don’t move, stay
right where you are,” shouted one of the men.  Vlad
stared at them and rapidly walking towards them.  The
officers opened fire on the master vampyre, but their
bullets didn’t even slow Vlad down and before they
knew it he was upon them.  Vlad grabbed one of the men
by the back of the neck and flung him hard up against
the brick storefront.  He then grabbed the other man
and sunk his teeth into the officers throat, as he
drank his mind swam in a sea of arrogance, the night
belonged to him and there was no one who could stop
him.  He dropped the lifeless shell of the officer to
the ground and walked over to the other man who was
moaning in pain on the ground, picking up the gun that
lay next to the officer he rubbed his hand over one of
the wounds the bullets had caused.  Then Vlad fired
four shots into his victim, putting a bullet in both
each knee and elbow.  Vlad then tossed the gun to the
ground and turned to his children, “Go unto the night,
find me the witch, and destroy all who would stand in
our way, but save the slayer for me.”  After he had
finished speaking he kicked the helpless man in the
head before slowly walking into the night.</p>

<p>They sat in silence in the hotel room on the outskirts
of town, fearing what the night might bring and
wondering if they would see the sunrise.  Giles and
Megan both armed with crossbows kept watch over the
locked door as Kathryn guarded the window.  Joyce and
Cordelia sat in front of the police scanner Giles had
brought with them, listening as reports of roving
gangs terrorizing Sunnydale began to pour in.  Off in
a corner Buffy sat by herself, gazing off into space,
she had become lost within her own sorrow and there
was nothing anyone in the group could do to rescue her
as she slowly drowned in the misery of being separated
from her one true love. &lt;Willow please come back to
me&gt;</p>

<p>Ten vampires led by Spike stormed into a down town bar
and started ripping the place apart.  Four rather
drunk bikers stumbled to their feet and attempted to
start a fight with the vampires as several of the
other patrons ran for the door. One of the bikers took
a swing at Spike, but the blonde vamp caught his fist
in mid swing and crushed the bikers hand dropping the
man to his knees.  Spike then put both his hands on
the bikers head and snapped his neck.  Two of the
other bikers were jumped on by vampires before they
could even get a swing in, the last thing they would
ever recall before waking up in the forever was the
coldness of death as fangs sunk into their necks.  The
remaining biker managed to knock a vampire down only
to be picked up and thrown up against the wall by
another.  Before he could get back up two of the vamps
jumped him and began feeding as the bartender was
desperately trying to dial 911. </p>

<p>Vlad paced back and forth in front of the Joyce
Summers house, clenching his fist &lt;they hide, but no
one can elude me forever.&gt;  He was getting ready to
storm off when a car honked behind him. Vlad turned
around and a young man put his head out the window, “I
think they went somewhere, I saw them leaving earlier
this afternoon.  Could I help you.”</p>

<p>Vlad couldn’t believe his luck, these humans were so
stupid.  “I am looking for the redheaded girl called
Willow and was told she might be here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean the Rosenberg girl.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Vlad said with a sinister smile &lt;Rosenberg&gt;, Do
you know where I might find her”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I can’t help with that”</p>

<p>Vlad walked oup to the car and grabbed the man by the
shoulders and yanked him out through the window as the
women in the passenger seat began screaming, “Then you
can help me with this, I need substance,”  Vlad
grinned at the man showing his fangs then sunk them
into his victims neck.  After he had finished, Vlad
grabbed the bottom of the car with the women still in
it and flipped it over.  He pulled out a book of
matches and lit them.  As the woman begged for her
life Vlad tossed the burning matches on the car and
walked away.   Half way down the block from Joyce’s
home the master vampyre laughed out loud as he heard
the explosion, the night was truly his and these
pitiful creatures were only just beginning to feel his
wrath.</p>

<p>Cordelia had turned on the television in order to try
and find out more of what was going on.  Reports of,
emergency response teams rushing from one location to
another throughout Sunnydale along with the massive
influx of 911 calls had made the scanner almost
useless, Sunnydale seemed to be in total chaos and the
group wondered if anyone besides Vlad Tepes had even
an idea of what was happening.  The reporter on the
screen was announcing that the Sunnydale police chief
had enacted an immediate curfew and that all citizens
were to get off the street immediately and stay in
their homes until the roving gangs that were wrecking
havoc on the town were brought under control.  They
were also estimating that there were at least
twenty-two dead and several others injured.</p>

<p>Vlad stood next to the overturned telephone booth
holding the white and yellow book that read, Sunnydale
and vicinity.  He began flipping through the telephone
book, it didn’t take him long to find what he was
looking for, the name practically leaped out at him
when he saw it, and to top it off there was only one
entry.  Vlad tossed the book to the ground and began
to walk away, he had to go and pay Ira and Sheila
Rosenberg a visit.</p>

<p>Ira Rosenberg sat alone in the empty house getting
drunk like he had been doing for the last two nights
since his wife had stormed out screaming that he no
longer was the man she had fell in love with, how
could he say that to his own daughter, and that she
never wanted to see him again.  He missed Shelia but
he was right and wasn’t about to apologies. What their
daughter had become was wrong, first the witchcraft
and now she was dating that blonde girl, the one who
always seemed to be in some sort of trouble.  He
blamed the blonde for his problems but just didn’t
know what to do about it.  How could Sheila accept
Willows decision, what was his wife thinking when she
said that maybe Buffy was good for Willow.  No way
that blonde girl is good for my Willow thought Ira as
he took another drink of his beer.  Ira thought no he
knew that he had done the right thing when he had told
Willow that as long as she was with Buffy that she was
no longer his daughter, he had just not planned on his
wife leaving him over it.  Ira finished off his beer
and tossed it into the growing pile of empty bottles
next to the couch.  He then grabbed another one from
the cooler that sat on the couch next to him and
opened it and began to drink, &lt;Damn you Buffy
Summers&gt;. </p>

<p>Spike and the other vampires had totally devastated
downtown Sunnydale but had been unable to find Willow,
so the blonde vampire decided that it was time to pay
the campus a visit.  As they were making their way out
of the down town area they came upon a roadblock.
Several of Sunnydale’s finest were lined behind their
cruisers with their weapons pointing at the group of
vampires.  Spike looked at his brethren, “Bloody hell,
I haven't had this much fun in decades.” </p>

<p>The group of vampires then proceeded to charge the
blockade, as the police opened fire.  Vampires were
getting hit left and right as they rushed the
officers.  They would fall to the ground only to get
back up again screaming obscenities at a very confused
and frightened police line.  Spike was the first one
to break into the ranks of the blockade, he quickly
grabbed one of the cops and flung her into the
oncoming vampires.  A second officer produced a
nightstick, which Spike ripped from his hands and
proceeded to thrash the man with it as the rest of the
vampires rushed into the blockade.</p>

<p>Ira Rosenberg stumbled up from the couch and staggered
towards the door, who could possibly be out at this
time of night.  He opened the door to see a young man
dressed in black and wearing a red cape at the door,
“I suppose you're one of Willows little witch
friends,” he said sarcastically as he noticed the mans
unusual attire.</p>

<p>“Not exactly, but I do seek her, may I come in,”
Replied Vlad.</p>

<p>A hammered Ira Rosenberg looked at the young man for a
second, “Why the hell not, I could use the company.
Come on in and pull up a seat,” Slurred Ira</p>

<p>Vlad stepped into the Rosenberg house and followed Ira
as he staggered back towards the couch, The Master
vampyre silently wondered if he would become
elaborated after he fed off of the witch’s father.
Vlad looked at this pitiful creature before him and
spoke, “Do you know where your daughter is”</p>

<p>“No and I don’t care.  As far as I am concerned she is
not my daughter as long as she continues to be with
that other girl,” shouted Ira.</p>

<p>“Perhaps your wife might have some idea, is she
around” inquired Vlad.</p>

<p>The master vampyre watched as Ira lowered his head,
and realized that this man didn’t even know where his
wife was, he would be of no use.  Vlad got up from the
chair he was sitting in and walked over to Ira.  He
grabbed Ira by the shoulders and lifted the man up off
of the couch with one hand, maybe he could find
something useful in the house once he had fed.</p>

<p>Joyce was on the phone talking with Shelia, Willows
mom had called from the bread and breakfast she had
been staying at every since she had left her husband.
Shelia asked if any one had heard from Willow and
when she was told that they didn’t she asked how Buffy
was holding up.  The older Rosenberg woman had seen
that which her idiot husband had been unable to, Buffy
and Willow were simply met to be together and loved
each other like no one else ever could.  She knew that
it would take awhile to adjust to her daughter’s
lifestyle but she was determined to support the two
young women in every way she could, but she needed to
find Willow first.</p>

<p>As the two women talked on the phone Giles was glued
to the television as the reports as they came in.  The
downtown area had been practically obliterated and a
police line meant to contain the supposed roving gangs
had been broken.  The watcher looked at the rest of
the group then back to the television, he felt so
helpless.  He wasn’t supposed to be hiding like a
frightened child, he should be out there trying to
stop the vampires. Giles let out a sigh, they had
faced the master, the Mayor, and countless other
demons and vampires, but now Vlad Tepes had forced
them to go into hiding, what had become of them.   </p>

<p>Vlad marched through Buffy and Willows dorm wielding
the broad sword that he had picked up from the mansion
before heading to the campus.  He  kicked in the doors
to every room in the dorm, anyone who was foolish
enough to come out into the hall was immediately
decapitated by the master vampyre, the time had come
to stop looking for the witch and force her and the
slayer to come to him.  He was more enraged than when
the night had begun, the darkness that consumed him no
longer could be contained. When the master vampire
reached the end of the hallway he turned around and
looked at the bodies that littered it, turning away
from them he proceeded up the stairs to the next
floor, he would get their attention, he would force
them to show themselves, and anyone who stood in his
way would pay the price.</p>

<p>Spike and the others had arrived at the dorm just as
the master vampyre walked out the main door
brandishing a bloody sword.  Vlad looked at Spike,
“William, my patience is gone, it is time to leave a
message for the slayer and her little witch”</p>

<p>“Yes master”</p>

<p>Vlad then turned away from his children, looking at
the night sky he screamed out in frustration, how
could this mortal girl elude him so.  He looked to the
sky and saw that the darkness was beginning to fade,
He had won the night, but the witch once again had
escaped him.  He turned to Spike, then spoke.  His
words were filled with bitterness and he felt as if he
was going to choke on each one of them, “Day is almost
here, we must hurry”</p>

<p>The dawn brought no joy to Sunnydale, it only revealed
the atrocities that Vlad Tepes and his children had
brought upon the town.  Buffy had fell into a restless
sleep as the rest of the group sat in silence as
images of downtown Sunnydale filled the screen.  Half
the stores were burnt out, cars were overturned, and
the side walk was littered with the carnage the
vampiric army had left in it’s path, they gasp in
terror when the images of the college campus came on
the screen.  A reporter stood in front of a police
line saying that an unidentified man carrying a sword
had decapitated at least thirty students inside.
Giles felt his heart stop for a second as the camera
zoomed in on the front of the dorm.  On each side of
the entrance was a decapitated body impaled on large
metal spear, and written in blood above the entrance
was ‘Wicca yea can not escape My fury, I come.  Vlad.’</p>

<p>Giles got up and turned the television off, he looked
at the others and over to Buffy as she tossed back and
forth in the chair in which she slept.  He then went
over to the phone and dialed England to try and get a
status on when additional help would be arriving.  As
Giles was talking on the phone there was a knock at
the door and Kathryn went over and opened the door.
Shelia Rosenberg looked at the young girl, “May I come
in”</p>

<p>Before Kathryn could answer Joyce answered, “Sure,
come in Shelia”</p>

<p>“Any word since I last talked to you,” asked Shelia
her voice filled with fear over what had might have
happened to her daughter.</p>

<p>“No, we haven’t heard anything but I am sure that she
is fine”</p>

<p> Shelia looked at the other mother saw the sincerity
that she spoke with and somehow knew that Joyce was
right.  She then looked over at Buffy, “How is she
holding up?”</p>

<p>“Not good, She hasn’t eaten anything since Willow
vanished, all she does is sit off by herself and cry,
We can’t even get her to talk to us anymore.  I don’t
know what is going to happen to her or the world if we
don’t find Willow soon.”</p>

<p>“The world, Joyce what are you talking about?”</p>

<p>Joyce looked at Shelia,  “You had better brace
yourself, if Willow and Buffy are going to be a couple
you deserve to know the truth.”</p>

<p>Vlad stood in the center of the room staring at Angel,
“I know you can hear me, so listen.  Soon I will have
the witch and when I do the slayer will follow.  I
have decided that I will allow you to die, but not
until I turn the slayer, I want you to see it, to
witness your final failure before I send you to hell.”
Vlad walked over to Angel and grabbed his left index
finger, “In the meantime you still belong to me, and I
wish to send a present to the Slayer,” Vlad pulled out
a dagger from underneath his cape and tightened his
grip on Angel’s finger, “This will do nicely.”</p>

<p>All of the sudden Buffy shot up from the chair she was
in, she rushed to the door and flung it open with so
much force it almost came off of it’s hinges.
Standing in the hallway, preparing to knock was
Willow.  Buffy dropped to her knees as tears of joy
flowed down her cheeks and wrapped her arms around
Willows waste as she placed her head up against her
love.  Willow knelt down and helped Buffy to her feet
then embraced the girl.  </p>

<p>As Willow and Buffy stood there in the hallway holding
on to one another Brigid looked down from the forever
at the two young women, the awakening had begun. </p>
