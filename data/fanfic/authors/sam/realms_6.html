<!-- Realms \ Part 5 -->

<p>Buffy felt Willow in her arms as she awoke, the slayer smiled as she
remembered the events of last night that had brought them to this
point. She knew that she should get up and begin her morning workout
routine before getting ready for classes but she didn't. Instead
she
laid there in Willows arms and watched her sleep, trying to hold on
to the magic of last night just a little longer.</p>

<p>Willow opened her eyes to see Buffy gazing into them and
smiled, "Uh, how long have you been up?"</p>

<p>"About two hours."</p>

<p>"And you been laying her the whole time," questioned Willow,
after
all Buffy usually had worked out and showered before she even got up.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I kinda wanted to bask in the moment. I know that
probably
sounds sappy and everything, but it is the truth."</p>

<p>"No, I think it sounds sweet," replied Willow just before
giving
Buffy light kiss.</p>

<p>Just then there was a loud knocking at the door, Buffy frowned and
got up, "looks like the moments over."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but it was only the beginning, I have a feeling we are
going
to be together for a long long time."</p>

<p>Buffy turned to Willow form the door and smiled, "You mean
that."</p>

<p>"Of course I do, now that I finally found you I have no intention
of
ever letting you go."</p>

<p>"Ditto," replied the slayer before rather forcefully jerking
the door
open. "Faith what in the world are you doing knocking on our
door at
7:30 in the morning!"</p>

<p>Faith stood there for a moment like a deer caught in the headlight of
an oncoming Truck, She could tell that the blond slayer was not at
all happy at being disturbed and was afraid she might take it out on
her. She took a rather large gulp of air, "B the G-man sent me
to
get you and Willow, something about needing you two to skip classes
so we can come up with a battle plan."</p>

<p>The fire in Buffy's eyes quickly dwindled and was replaced by
concern, Giles wouldn't send Faith to get them and have them skip
classes unless it was something big."</p>

<p>Willow walked over to the door, put her head on Buffy's shoulder,
and
wrapped her arms around her loves waist, which resulted in a very
wide cat who just at the canary smile from Faith, "Told ya so
B."</p>

<p>Buffy just grinned at the other slayer as she placed her arm around
Willow. The red head looked at Faith then to Buffy, "What did
she
tell you."</p>

<p>Buffy blushed at Willows question, "I'll tell you later,
right now
Giles wants us to skip classes and get over to his place."</p>

<p>"It's not the end of the world, is it," inquires Willow.</p>

<p>Buffy looked to Faith for a answer but the brunette just shrugged her
shoulders, "He didn't say Red."</p>

<p>The three girls walked into Giles living room and saw that Xander and
Anya were already their along with Tara. Buffy immediately put her
arm around Willow and pulled the red head close to her. She then
cocked her head towards Faith and whispered, "What is she doing
here?"</p>

<p>"Easy B, I'll go find out," Faith then walked over to
Giles and
pulled him aside.</p>

<p>Tara nervously fidgeted in her chair, she could feel the coldness
towards her in the steel blue eyes of the slayer. The slayers gaze
seemed to penetrate into her soul like a sharp daggers, and she
found herself wishing she was anywhere but there.</p>

<p>Willow looked at Tara and saw that her former girlfriend was staring
in their direction with a look of panic in her eyes. She turned to
her love to see Buffy coldly staring at Tara, "Buffy, could we
step
outside to talk for a moment."</p>

<p>Willow looked at Buffy as the two of them stood outside Giles
house, "What were you doing in there?"</p>

<p>"Nothing I was just waiting for Faith to come back over from
talking
to Giles."</p>

<p>"Are you sure, because it looked like you where about to stake
Tara."</p>

<p>Buffy lowered her head so she didn't have to look at Willow when
she
answered, "I didn't mean to it's just that when I saw
here there
everything came back, how you two where together and I was caught on
the outside loving you, I guess I was just afraid that she might try
to get you back."</p>

<p>Willow placed her hand under Buffy's chin and lifted it up so she
could look her best friend and lover in the eyes, "Listen to me.
I'm
not with Tara anymore, I'm with you and that's where I plan
on
staying. There is nothing that Tara or anyone else could ever do to
make me leave you. I love you more than I have loved anyone or
anything in my life and that's never going to change."</p>

<p>A tear rolled down Buffy's cheek as she heard the truthfulness in
Willow's words, she embraced the red head almost lifting her off
the
ground, "Oh My God, I love you so much that I can`t even
find the
words to tell you."</p>

<p>Willow tapped Buffy on the .shoulder, "This is nice but air is
starting to become an issue,"</p>

<p>Buffy loosened her grip on Willow so and the red head took a couple
deep breaths. Sorry about that, I guess I got carried away."</p>

<p>"That's OK, if you going to get carried away I can't
think of a
better way than loving me."</p>

<p>Faith cleared her throat from the doorway, "Uh, B are you about
done
or ya gonna need more time."</p>

<p>Buffy broke the embrace with Willow and turned to Faith leaving one
of her arms wrapped around Willows waste. "We're done."</p>

<p>Faith closed the door and walked over to new couple, "He said
that
she is here to help, and that you don't have anything to worry
about."</p>

<p>"Thanks, I guess we should go back in and find out what's up."</p>

<p>The rest of the group watched as the three girls walked into Giles
living room for the second time in a half hour. Buffy walked over to
the table and sat down then pulled Willow into her lap which got wide
stares from Xander and Anya, "well are we going to sit around
here
all morning or are we going to talk about how Me and Faith are going
to slay whatever big nasty decided to show up this time."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's not that simple, it appears that once
again my past
has come back to create problems for us."</p>

<p>"Is it Ethan again?" </p>

<p>"No, That would be a lot easier to deal with. It seems a warlock
I
knew in my darker days called Ciarán is planning to attempt to
increase his power through the Hellmouth."</p>

<p>"So we get Red and Blondie to use some magic to distract him and
Me
and B will keep care of him," Quipped Faith</p>

<p>"It's not going to be easy, for one thing Ciarán is
extremely
powerful, and also we don't know where he is at or if he is even
here
yet."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Maggie was straightening up the counter of the magic shop when she
noticed to men walk in and immediately head over to the counter. Foe
some reason she felt the sudden urge to close up shop and get as far
away from these two men as she could, there was something very wrong
with aura they were putting out, "May I help you?"</p>

<p>Ciarán looked at the Witch who ran this magic shop, "I hope
so, we
seek a tome of demon summoning?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry but I do not carry that type of material."</p>

<p>"What ashamed, tell me this then do you know where I can find a
suitable sacrifice."</p>

<p>Maggie reached her hand under the counter and started feeling for the
button that would trigger the alarm notifying the police,
"I-i'm g-
going t-to h-have to a-ask you to
l-l-leave."</p>

<p>Ciarán placed his hand in front of Maggie's face revealing the
Symbol
of Tursa
on his palm, he then moved his hand counterclockwise through the air
causing the shop owner to pass out. Ciarán then turned to Ethan,
"She
will do."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"So B, you decided to tell her I see," inquired Faith as the
two
slayers walked through the cemetery on patrol.</p>

<p>"Actually she told me when I came home from patrol last night"</p>

<p>"Wicked cool, so as Anya would say are the two of you..."</p>

<p>Buffy quickly cut off her friend when she saw where this conversation
was headed, "Don't even think of finishing that sentence."</p>

<p>"OK, I'll stop."</p>

<p>Buffy stopped in her tracts, "Faith I think we got company."</p>

<p>A dozen vampires made their way out from behind a row of tombstones
and started heading towards the two slayers. "You ready,"
asked Buffy</p>

<p>"Ready as I'm gonna get."</p>

<p>Faith took up a fighting stance as Buffy soared through the air
catching on of the vampires on the chin with a flying roundhouse
sending him flying backwards. She hit another vampire with a solid
left hook knocking him down. Two other rushed at her only to be
mysteriously thrown back when Buffy threw her hands up in defense.</p>

<p>Faith found herself surrounded by three vampires. She quickly
knocked one down with a series of jabs and uppercuts. One of the
vampires then managed to knock her to the ground, but Faith rolled
out of the way as he went to jump on her. She quickly got to her
knees and staked the vamp before h e could get back up. The third
vampire charged her swinging wildly at the brunette slayer, but Faith
blocked off his attack.</p>

<p>Buffy had already staked five of the nine vampires she was fighting
when two of them grabbed her from behind. The remaining two started
to close in on her. She stomped down hard on the vampire to her
left's foot causing him to let go, she broke the grip of the
other
vamp and flung him into the oncoming vamps, knocking them down. She
spun around so that she was facing the vampire who she hand foot
stomped. He took a swing at her only to have the slayer catch his
fist. Buffy then squeezed down tightly on it crushing every bone in
his hand. When the vampire dropped to his knees Buffy grabbed him by
the head and literally ripped it off turning him to dust. She then
took a stake in both hands and tossed them threw the air vaporizing
two more vampires. The remaining vampire looked at the slayer and
then sprinted off into the night as fast has his legs would carry him.</p>

<p>Faith stood there staring at the blond slayer, she couldn't
believe
what she had witnessed after finishing off the last vamp that had
charged her. Buffy had moved faster than she thought was possible
even for a slayer, and the strength she displayed by ripping off the
vampires had was amazing, but what really held her in awe was the
fact that Buffy had somehow thrown vampires backwards without even
touching them. "B that was amazing, how'd ya do it."</p>

<p>"I'm not really sure, I think we should call it a night,
could you
brief Giles for me, and tell him that I'll talk to him
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"B, what you just did was beyond impressive, don't you think
you
should let him know sooner."</p>

<p>Buffy looked at Faith and spoke with extreme authority, "I got to
get
home to Willow, it can wait."</p>

<p>Faith grinned at the blond slayer, "Point taken, Have fun."</p>
