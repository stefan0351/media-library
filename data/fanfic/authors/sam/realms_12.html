<!-- Realms \ Part 11 -->

<p>Faith opened her eyes as the first rays of light flickered through
her bedroom window, she started to get out of bed when she realized
she wasn't alone, turning her head to her right she looked at the
blonde immortal that was peacefully sleeping by her side and smiled.  </p>

<p>Faith gently tugged on Tara's shoulder, "Time to get up."</p>

<p>"Uh huh, where am I?"</p>

<p>"Your at Giles place."</p>

<p>Tara sat up in bed and gazed into the brunette slayers eyes, "Oh,
Uh...Good M-morining"</p>

<p>Faith grinned at the blonde and grabbed her by the hand, "It
certainly is."</p>

<p>Tara felt here heart began to race as Faith held her hand, "D-do we
need to talk"</p>

<p>"Probably"</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Willow felt her lovers soft lips press against her forehead, "Morning"</p>

<p>"Morning," replied Buffy just before tenderly kissing Willow's lips.</p>

<p>"Hmm, I think I could wake up this way for the rest of my life."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled at her beloved, "I think I can arrange that."</p>

<p>The slayer then deeply kissed Willow, "I love you, I have always
loved you, and I always will love you."</p>

<p>Willow gave her a mischievous grin, "I love you too, now how about
another kiss."</p>

<p>"Your wish is my command," replied Buffy. </p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>"Tara, about last night."</p>

<p>"Y-yes."</p>

<p>"I...I really don't know where to start so I'm just going to shoot
from the hip.  First thanks for fixing me up, and second thanks for
staying with me."</p>

<p>"Y-your welcome," replied Tara with a tear in her eye.</p>

<p>Faith reached over and carefully wiped it away, "There's a third
part, you know."</p>

<p>"There is?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, there is.  I'm not sure what is happening between us but it
feels right and I want to give it a chance.  Do you?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes."</p>

<p>"Good, I was kinda hoping you'd say that."</p>

<p>Tara nervously fiddled with her hair as Faith slid up against
her, "UH....W-what...."</p>

<p>"Shhh," replied Faith as she placed her finger against the blondes
lips, "I sorta want to try something."</p>

<p> "W-what"</p>

<p>"This," replied Faith placing her forehead against Tara's. </p>

<p>The two young women stayed like that for a moment listening to one
anothers rapid breathing, afraid to go any further.  Faith then moved
in even closer to Tara, she affectionately gave the blonde a quick
kiss then pulled back to gauge the other girls reaction</p>

<p>"That was..."</p>

<p>"Amazing" </p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Giles immediately walked over as soon as Buffy and Willow walked into
his house,  "I need to talk to the two of you in private."</p>

<p>As soon as the three of them got into the kitchen Buffy stared at
Giles, her face filled with deep concern as she held protectively on
to Willow, "OK, what's the bad news?"</p>

<p>Giles smiled at the slayer, "Buffy, what makes you think there is bad
news?"</p>

<p>"Well it might be the fact that there is a Warlock in town and that
he has made some kinda of alliance with a demon prince."</p>

<p>"Point taken, but I assure you what I have to say is not bad at all."</p>

<p>"That's good," responded Buffy as she loosened her grip on
Willow, "So what`s up?"</p>

<p>"I have always though of you as a daughter and was wondering about
how you would feel if I was to be your step dad."</p>

<p>"You guys are getting married," exclaimed a very excited
slayer, "When did you pop the question?" </p>

<p>"I haven't, I wanted to talk to you first."</p>

<p>Buffy grinned from ear to ear as she looked at her watcher, "You're
asking my permission aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, so what do you think."</p>

<p>"Giles except for Willow, you and my Mom are the most important
people in my life  I say go for it but only if me and Willow get to
be brides maids."</p>

<p>Giles smiled in relief, "Deal."</p>

<p>"So when you going to ask," replied Willow?</p>

<p>"Yeah good question, when?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking about this evening."</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow took there seats side by side at the table and
looked around at the others, stopping when they came to where Faith
and Tara where seated.  Both of them noticed how the brunette slayer
and the blonde immortal where sitting rather closely to one another.
A though came accrosed Buffy's mind so she pretended to accidentally
knock Willow's backpack off the table so she could pick it up.</p>

<p>Once down below the table she quickly looked accrosed to where her
fellow slayer was seated and confirmed her suspicions, the two of
them where holding hands.  </p>

<p>She placed the backpack on the table and leaned over and whispered in
her girlfriends ear, which resulted in Willow giving Tara and Faith a
quick look before turning to Buffy and shrugging.  </p>

<p>Buffy smiled at Willow and then gave the two girls a quick glance
before turning her attention to Giles, who was going over what they
knew about Ciarán and the Demon Prince. </p>

<p>&lt;I think me and Willow need to have a talk with Faith tonight on
patrol.&gt;</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Ciarán ran his hand accrosed the his dagger, he had hoped to kill
Rupert and the dark haired woman with it but the blonde and the red
head had managed to prevent that, not that it mattered.  Sure they
where more powerful than he expected the watcher's allies to be, but
it didn't concern him.  He wasn't even bothered by Ethan's capture,
after all his old apprentice was only a pawn.  Now that he was
aligned with the Demon Prince they all would soon be dead and he
would be the most powerful warlock in all the realms.  </p>

<p>&lt;Enjoy yourselves while you can for soon there will be no stopping me&gt;</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>"You call for me My Lord?" inquired the Gray Demon.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have a special task for you," replied Prince Laoise.</p>

<p>"What is it My Lord?"</p>

<p>"I have made an alliance that will soon allow my minions access to
Outer Earth, but a lot has changed since the Realm War.  I wish for
you to travel through the void and go to Outer Earth, meet with the
warlock Ciarán, and prepare for my arrival."</p>

<p>"How am I to get past the Sentinels My Lord?"</p>

<p>"I will send a strike force at the void to distract them long enough
for you to make your way through."</p>

<p>"Yes My Lord."</p>

<p>Laoise stood up from his throne, "One more thing, once you have made
contact with the warlock I wish for you to gather The Children of
Darkness that dwell on Outer Earth.  There where no slayers when my
armies last stormed Outer Earth and I don`t want any this time.  Find
the slayers and their allies and kill them"</p>

<p>"With pleasure my lord."</p>
