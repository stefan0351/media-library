<!-- Realms \ Part 12 -->

<p>Giles basked in Joyce's beauty as the tunes of Barry White played
softly in the background.  He noted how radiant she was in the
flickering candle light, and how it caused his pulse to quicken.
Taking a deep breath He got of from his chair and walked around the
dinner table, He got down on one knee and tenderly took Joyce's hand
in his, "Joyce, I love you more than anything, I can't imagine my
life without by my side.  Will you marry me?"</p>

<p>Joyce's heart beat rapidly, and tears began to from in her eyes. She
slid out of her chair, wrapped her arms around Giles, and kissed him
lightly on the cheek, "Yes, Rupert, Yes."</p>

<p>Giles folded his arms around his new fiancé and pulled her up against
him, "Joyce you just made me the happiest man on the earth," wept
Giles as he tenderly kissed Joyce's lips.</p>

<p>Giles pulled the diamond engagement ring from his lets pocket and
slid it on to Joyce's finger. Tears of pure joy flowed down her
cheeks as she gazed at the rig, "And you've made me the happiest
woman on the earth," sobbed Joyce as she rested her head on Giles
shoulder. </p>

<p>"Faith, can we talk," inquired Buffy as they made their way through
the cemetery.</p>

<p>"Sure B.  Whatta won't to talk about."</p>

<p>Buffy stopped, took Willow by the hand, and stared directly at her
fellow slayer, "You and Tara."</p>

<p>Faith saw the determination in both Buffy and Willows face and
sighed, "There's nothing to talk about."</p>

<p>"I think there is, so spill."</p>

<p>Faith looked at Buffy and Willow and shook her head, "Great, double
resolve face, when'd Red teach ya that B."</p>

<p>"Faith, you're stalling."</p>

<p>"We kissed."</p>

<p>"And held hands," added Buffy.</p>

<p>"You saw that B."</p>

<p>"We both did," replied Willow.</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"So what's the deal," inquired Buffy.</p>

<p>"I just told you, we kissed and....."</p>

<p>"And, what?"</p>

<p>"I liked it, I like her, now can we please talk about something else."</p>

<p>Buffy noticed the frustration that was in Faiths voice, "No we can't,
you obviously got feelings for her and from what we saw she seems to
have feelings for you.  Faith you should be happy, but your not.
What`s wrong?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure if she feels the same way?"</p>

<p>"Go on"</p>

<p>"The kiss, it was amazing and when we held hands I felt like I have
never felt with anyone one else ever before."</p>

<p>Buffy cocked her head towards Faith, "Anyone?"</p>

<p>"Anyone, I could feel the chemistry working between us," Faith hung
her head down before continuing. "But at the same time I could feel
tension  I know she felt the same way about the kiss, but I think she
regrets it.  I don`t know what to do B."</p>

<p>"Have you talked to Tara about it?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't know what to say."</p>

<p>Willow smiled at Faith, "Would you like me to talk to her about it?"</p>

<p>"You'd do that for me Red?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I would."</p>

<p>Buffy then walked up to Faith and comfortably put her hand on the
brunette slayer shoulder, "Faith, I got just one thing to say to you."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Take it slow."</p>

<p>"Buffy's right.  Tara's shy, plus she's probably still trying to deal
with the whole break up thing.  So for now be there for her, and take
it slow. OK?"</p>

<p>"OK."</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Tara wiped  the tears from her face as she answered the door, "Uh,
Willow...Is e-everything OK?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'm here to find out. Can I come in?"</p>

<p>"Sure," answered Tara motioning for Willow to enter.</p>

<p>"Uh, what did you want," nervously replied Tara.</p>

<p> "I need to talk to you about Faith."</p>

<p>"I'm s-sorry.....I shouldn't have let it happen, c-can you forgive
me," sobbed Tara as the guilt of kissing Faith overwhelmed her.</p>

<p>"Tara, what do you have to be sorry about?"</p>

<p>"The k-kiss, I d-didn't mean to betray you, it just....h-happened."</p>

<p>Willow placed her hand on Tara's shoulder, "Tara I know that the last
few weeks have been really hard on you so please don't take this the
wrong way, but how could kissing Faith betray me?"</p>

<p>Tara hung her head down so she wouldn't have to look Willow in the
eyes, "I k-know that your with.....B-buffy now, where you b-belong b-
but...I still f-feel g-guilty, I can't h-help it...a big part of me
still..
l-loves you"</p>

<p>"Tara, look at me.  What we had was very special, and while I still
care for you it's as a close friend.  I really hope that we can be
friends. Can we?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes."</p>

<p>"Good, I'm glad to hear that.  As for Faith, you have nothing to feel
guilty about, unless you're leading her own.  Do you like her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but.."</p>

<p>"But nothing Tara.  You need to move on, moping around like this is
unhealthy, take my word for it, I've went down that road with Oz and
I don't want to see you go through that.  I think you should give
Faith a chance, you two could be good for one another."</p>

<p>"I don't know if I'm ready," sobbed Tara.</p>

<p>"Then take it slow."</p>

<p>"I don't know where to start."</p>

<p>Willow got up and walked over to the door, "Talking to her would be a
good place," replied Willow as she opened the door and Buffy
practically pushed Faith into Tara's room.</p>

<p>Willow smiled at Tara and Faith as she stepped out into the hallway
with Buffy, "Remember take it slow." </p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>The two girls stood there staring at one another, each fearing that
they would choose the wrong words and ruin any chance of a
relationship with the other.</p>

<p>Faith gathered all of her inner strength and carefully moved over to
Tara, "Do you like me?"</p>

<p>"Yes"</p>

<p>"Good, because I like you," Faith paused for a moment as she
carefully though out her next words, "I know that I could never
replace Willow, but I would like to give us a try."</p>

<p>Tara could see the brunette slayers hands nervously trembling as she
waited for her to respond. She reached out and took Faith by the
hands, "S-so would I."</p>

<p>"What's your favorite color?"</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"I want to do this right, so I kinda figured we should sorta get to
know each other first."</p>

<p>"Oh....Blue, how about you?"</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>"So do you think it will work," Asked Buffy as she sat down on her
and Willow's bed?</p>

<p>"I think it has potential, if it works or not is up to them," Replied
Willow.</p>

<p>"Well I hope it works, Tara would be good for Faith, plus I wouldn't
have to worry about her trying to win your heart back."</p>

<p>Willow walked over to the bed and slid onto Buffy's lap, "How many
times do I have to tell you that you don't have to worry about that?
My heart belongs to you and you alone and nothing will ever change
that."</p>

<p>Buffy wrapped her arms around Willows waste and began planting soft
kisses on the back of the red heads neck causing Willow to let out a
low moan.  "I take it you like," Buffy said cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I like," murmured Willow as she leaned back into her soul mate.</p>

<p>Buffy continued to tenderly kiss Willow's neck as she pulled her love
back into the bed with her.  She slid out from beneath the red head
and positioned herself so she could look into Willow's enchanting
green eyes, "Your my world Willow, my reason for living, without you
I don`t think I could make it"</p>

<p>A tear rolled down Willow's cheek, "Buffy, that has got to be the
sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me."</p>

<p>Buffy leaned into Willow and embraced her, "There's more, I love you
so much, when you where with Tara I felt my heart break everyday, I
was alone, lost in my heartache  But now that we are together I feel
like the weight of the world has been lifted off of my shoulders.
You make me complete Willow."</p>

<p>Willow ran her hand accrosed Buffy's face and gently wiped away her
lovers tears, "I love you," replied Willow as she reached over to the
night stand and turned out the light.</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>"Warlock, we have much to discuss," replied the grey demon as he
walked into the warehouse where Ciarán had moved his operation to.</p>

<p>Ciarán's hand began to emitted a bright red glow as he pointed
towards the demon, "Who are you, and why have you invaded my
sanctuary," hissed the warlock.</p>

<p>"I am Torin, The Assassin.  I was sent by Laoise, Prince of Demons to
prepare for his arrival." </p>

<p>Ciarán lowered his hand and moved over towards the grey demon, "You
say you are an assassin?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is my duty to eliminate those who would oppose My Lord."</p>

<p> "I see,  do you have any one in particular in mind?"</p>

<p>"My Lord wished the Slayers and their allies dead."</p>

<p>A sinister smile came accrosed Ciarán's face, "I see we have similar
goals, tell me Torin do you have anything in particular in mind." </p>

<p>"Yes, but first we must gather the Children of the Night, I need to
gauge our enemies strength before we make our move."</p>
