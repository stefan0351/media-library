<!-- Realms \ Prelude -->

<p>Joyce Grabbed Giles from behind almost causing him to drop the book he was
engrossed in," What've got there?" she ask as she gave him a quick peck on
the cheek.</p>

<p>"I'm really not sure. It came this afternoon in the mail with no return
address and appears to be broken into several sections each one of them in a
different language. I just now found a section that is in Babylonian that I
can translate."</p>

<p>Joyce looked at him and smiled, she recognized the look on his face and new
that he wouldn't be able to enjoy himself until he figured out what was in
the book. "How about I throw something on to eat while you figure what's
in that book," She gave him another quick kiss on the cheek before heading
towards the kitchen.</p>

<p>Joyce had wanted to spend a romantic evening with Giles but realized that
wasn't going to be possible until he figured out what was in the book.
Early off in their relationship she had learned that when it came to books,
especial really old ones, written in forgotten languages he was like a
little kid in a brand new toy. He wouldn't be able to concentrate on
anything else until he deciphered what he was reading. At first it had
bothered her but she eventually came to love him even more for it, mainly
because of the countless times that particular habit of his had saved Buffy
and her friends lives.</p>

<p>Giles sat in his recliner, his eyes glued to the book that he held in his
hands. He read the fascinating tale that lay before him.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1cm;">'The Realm war.'</p>

<p style="margin-left:1cm;">'To all that read this ancient tale heed the words written<br>
within for they have been scribed in the blood of a<br>
thousand martyrs. For Two hundred plus twenty Years the<br>
Sentinel warriors that serve the Powers that be and several<br>
immortals from the Ethereal realm fought against the Demon<br>
armies of Inner Earth who wished to conquer Outer earth and<br>
enslave the mortals who lived there. In the end they were<br>
victorious and the Demons were driven back into inner earth<br>
and the portals that linked the two realms were closed, but<br>
the cost of the war was high. Thousands of Sentinels<br>
sacrificed their lives and thousands upon thousands of the<br>
mortals were slain as they defended Outer Earth.'</p>

<p>Giles mind came to a sudden stop as he went to the next paragraph. Before
him were possibly answers to age old questions that the council did not even
know.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1cm;">'Of Hell's Mouths and Vampires'</p>

<p style="margin-left:1cm;">'After the realm war the Powers that Be sent the Sentinels and<br>
several mages were sent into the void that separates the two<br>
earth Realms in the hopes that they would be able to prevent<br>
any other demonic invasions before they reached outer Earth.<br>
The void severed its purpose well until those on outer earth<br>
dedicated to dark magic learned of the Realm war and wished to<br>
seize the power of the demons for their own. These warlocks<br>
attempted to open several gateways to inner earth called<br>
Hell's Mouths but the mages of the void were successful in<br>
stopping most of them. The Hell's Mouths that were opened did<br>
not stay that way for long. The Sentinels quickly repelled<br>
the demons that sought passage through the Hell's Mouth as the<br>
mages of the void sealed it. Sadly the Sentinels were unable<br>
to stop all the demons and some made it to outer earth and<br>
quickly spread out a crossed the vast realm. Then tragedy<br>
struck, a rare Zerain demon known for its great blood lust<br>
made it to outer earth. The demon quickly began feeding on<br>
the mortals. The fortunate ones died at its hands, the less<br>
fortunate lost their souls to it and became the demon's<br>
servants bringing into being a new species, the vampire.</p>

<p>As Giles read the next line he froze, what he had just read had been more
than he had hoped for but what now was before him might be the greatest
revelation off all. He reread the line several times to ensure that his
translation was correct, then he simply stared at the words before him that
read, 'The Slayer.' He then paused for a second to gather the thoughts that
were racing through his mind before continuing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As The Powers that Be saw what was happening on outer earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they realized that it needed a champion not only to fight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the demons that managed to make it through the void<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the race of Vampire the Zerain demon had created, but to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also aid the inhabitants of the void in closing the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell's mouths as they opened. So they summoned the immortal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warrior Alexandria gave to her the essence of the chosen one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the ability to call a slayer into service. Alexandria was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about to call the first slayer but stopped, the immortal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warrior turned to the Powers that Be and asked how will their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;champion know what to do and who will 	guide her. The Powers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that Be then pondered the question for a moment and debated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amongst themselves. They knew that whoever watched over the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chosen champion would have to be mortal. They could not do it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they were Gods and Goddesses and their appearance to a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mortal girl would most likely frighten her. They also knew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they could not appoint an immortal to do it because 	 most of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them were unpredictable and would most likely become<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bored over time and simply stop performing their task. After<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;several days of debating it was decided that they would<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appoint a group of mortals over the slayer and make them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answerable to Alexandria and so both watcher and slayer came to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who have read the words contained above know that to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you great knowledge has been given. What you choose to do with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is of your own accord but I plea with you to choose wisely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the knowledge gained can strengthen the earth or destroy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Fey'</p>

<p>Giles laid the book down on the stand next to the recliner and headed to
join Joyce. He walked slowly through his house as he made his way to the
kitchen, the words of the mysterious book echoed in his mind. A thousand
questions raced in his head, He now had knowledge of how Slayers,
Hellsmouths, and vampires came into being but he was unsure of what to do
with that knowledge. Strangely the biggest question in his mind was not
about anything scribed in the book but about the signature at the end, &lt;Who
is Fey?&gt;</p>

<p>Buffy sat in her and Willows dorm room alone staring at a picture of the
redheaded hacker. A tear rolled down her cheek as she mentally scolded
herself for not having the courage to tell Willow that she loved her. If
only she would have looked her sweet redheaded friend in the eyes and said
those magic words, I love you more than anything else, things might be
different. But she had been afraid that Willow would not have felt the
same way so she remained quite and now her secret love had found Tara and
was with the blonde witch right now. Buffy felt jealously rip through the
fabric of her being at the mere thought of Willow and Tara being together.
What did the other girl do to deserve Willow. The slayers inner voice
yelled at her mockingly, "She did what you were afraid to do and told Willow
how she felt."</p>

<p>Another tear rolled down Buffy's cheek as she lay back in her bed mourning
over the chance she had lost with Willow. She closed her eyes and began to
fade into a restless sleep.</p>

<p>"It's not to late to tell her slayer," replied the brown haired woman that
stood before Buffy.</p>

<p>Buffy looked at the women then at the scenery around her. She then turned
back to her, "Who are you and where am I?"</p>

<p>"This place is not real it exist only in your dreams. As for me, I am your
spirit guide but you may call me Fey."</p>

<p>As Buffy looked at Fey, her face echoed the curiosity that ran through her
mind, "What's do you mean by spirit guide and what do you want?"</p>

<p>"A spirit guide is someone who helps you through life. My intentions are
pure, I mean only to help you. Now that we have that cleared up we must
talk."</p>

<p>"About what?"</p>

<p>"About the one called Willow. The one you are in love with. You must tell
her how you feel."</p>

<p>"I can't, she already has someone, I have no right to interfere with her
happiness."</p>

<p>"You love her with all your heart that gives you every right. Besides who
is to say that she wouldn't be happier with you, besides her and the other
are not met t o be."</p>

<p>Fey looked at the blonde slayer and saw that she was not reaching the girl.
She let out a soft sigh; this was going to be much more difficult than she
had thought.</p>
