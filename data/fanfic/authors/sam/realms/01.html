<p>Joyce Grabbed Giles from behind almost causing him to drop the book he was
engrossed in," What've got there?" she ask as she gave him a quick peck on
the cheek.</p>

<p>"I'm really not sure. It came this afternoon in the mail with no return
address and appears to be broken into several sections each one of them in a
different language. I just now found a section that is in Babylonian that I
can translate."</p>

<p>Joyce looked at him and smiled, she recognized the look on his face and new
that he wouldn't be able to enjoy himself until he figured out what was in
the book. "How about I throw something on to eat while you figure what's
in that book," She gave him another quick kiss on the cheek before heading
towards the kitchen.</p>

<p>Joyce had wanted to spend a romantic evening with Giles but realized that
wasn't going to be possible until he figured out what was in the book.
Early off in their relationship she had learned that when it came to books,
especial really old ones, written in forgotten languages he was like a
little kid in a brand new toy. He wouldn't be able to concentrate on
anything else until he deciphered what he was reading. At first it had
bothered her but she eventually came to love him even more for it, mainly
because of the countless times that particular habit of his had saved Buffy
and her friends lives.</p>

<p>Giles sat in his recliner, his eyes glued to the book that he held in his
hands. He read the fascinating tale that lay before him.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1cm;">'The Realm war.'</p>

<p style="margin-left:1cm;">'To all that read this ancient tale heed the words written<br>
within for they have been scribed in the blood of a<br>
thousand martyrs. For Two hundred plus twenty Years the<br>
Sentinel warriors that serve the Powers that be and several<br>
immortals from the Ethereal realm fought against the Demon<br>
armies of Inner Earth who wished to conquer Outer earth and<br>
enslave the mortals who lived there. In the end they were<br>
victorious and the Demons were driven back into inner earth<br>
and the portals that linked the two realms were closed, but<br>
the cost of the war was high. Thousands of Sentinels<br>
sacrificed their lives and thousands upon thousands of the<br>
mortals were slain as they defended Outer Earth.'</p>

<p>Giles mind came to a sudden stop as he went to the next paragraph. Before
him were possibly answers to age old questions that the council did not even
know.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1cm;">'Of Hell's Mouths and Vampires'</p>

<p style="margin-left:1cm;">'After the realm war the Powers that Be sent the Sentinels and<br>
several mages were sent into the void that separates the two<br>
earth Realms in the hopes that they would be able to prevent<br>
any other demonic invasions before they reached outer Earth.<br>
The void severed its purpose well until those on outer earth<br>
dedicated to dark magic learned of the Realm war and wished to<br>
seize the power of the demons for their own. These warlocks<br>
attempted to open several gateways to inner earth called<br>
Hell's Mouths but the mages of the void were successful in<br>
stopping most of them. The Hell's Mouths that were opened did<br>
not stay that way for long. The Sentinels quickly repelled<br>
the demons that sought passage through the Hell's Mouth as the<br>
mages of the void sealed it. Sadly the Sentinels were unable<br>
to stop all the demons and some made it to outer earth and<br>
quickly spread out a crossed the vast realm. Then tragedy<br>
struck, a rare Zerain demon known for its great blood lust<br>
made it to outer earth. The demon quickly began feeding on<br>
the mortals. The fortunate ones died at its hands, the less<br>
fortunate lost their souls to it and became the demon's<br>
servants bringing into being a new species, the vampire.</p>

<p>As Giles read the next line he froze, what he had just read had been more
than he had hoped for but what now was before him might be the greatest
revelation off all. He reread the line several times to ensure that his
translation was correct, then he simply stared at the words before him that
read, 'The Slayer.' He then paused for a second to gather the thoughts that
were racing through his mind before continuing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As The Powers that Be saw what was happening on outer earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they realized that it needed a champion not only to fight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the demons that managed to make it through the void<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the race of Vampire the Zerain demon had created, but to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also aid the inhabitants of the void in closing the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell's mouths as they opened. So they summoned the immortal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warrior Alexandria gave to her the essence of the chosen one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the ability to call a slayer into service. Alexandria was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about to call the first slayer but stopped, the immortal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;warrior turned to the Powers that Be and asked how will their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;champion know what to do and who will 	guide her. The Powers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that Be then pondered the question for a moment and debated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amongst themselves. They knew that whoever watched over the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chosen champion would have to be mortal. They could not do it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they were Gods and Goddesses and their appearance to a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mortal girl would most likely frighten her. They also knew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they could not appoint an immortal to do it because 	 most of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them were unpredictable and would most likely become<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bored over time and simply stop performing their task. After<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;several days of debating it was decided that they would<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appoint a group of mortals over the slayer and make them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answerable to Alexandria and so both watcher and slayer came to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who have read the words contained above know that to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you great knowledge has been given. What you choose to do with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is of your own accord but I plea with you to choose wisely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the knowledge gained can strengthen the earth or destroy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it.'</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Fey'</p>

<p>Giles laid the book down on the stand next to the recliner and headed to
join Joyce. He walked slowly through his house as he made his way to the
kitchen, the words of the mysterious book echoed in his mind. A thousand
questions raced in his head, He now had knowledge of how Slayers,
Hellsmouths, and vampires came into being but he was unsure of what to do
with that knowledge. Strangely the biggest question in his mind was not
about anything scribed in the book but about the signature at the end, &lt;Who
is Fey?&gt;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy sat in her and Willows dorm room alone staring at a picture of the
redheaded hacker. A tear rolled down her cheek as she mentally scolded
herself for not having the courage to tell Willow that she loved her. If
only she would have looked her sweet redheaded friend in the eyes and said
those magic words, I love you more than anything else, things might be
different. But she had been afraid that Willow would not have felt the
same way so she remained quite and now her secret love had found Tara and
was with the blonde witch right now. Buffy felt jealously rip through the
fabric of her being at the mere thought of Willow and Tara being together.
What did the other girl do to deserve Willow. The slayers inner voice
yelled at her mockingly, "She did what you were afraid to do and told Willow
how she felt."</p>

<p>Another tear rolled down Buffy's cheek as she lay back in her bed mourning
over the chance she had lost with Willow. She closed her eyes and began to
fade into a restless sleep.</p>

<p>"It's not to late to tell her slayer," replied the brown haired woman that
stood before Buffy.</p>

<p>Buffy looked at the women then at the scenery around her. She then turned
back to her, "Who are you and where am I?"</p>

<p>"This place is not real it exist only in your dreams. As for me, I am your
spirit guide but you may call me Fey."</p>

<p>As Buffy looked at Fey, her face echoed the curiosity that ran through her
mind, "What's do you mean by spirit guide and what do you want?"</p>

<p>"A spirit guide is someone who helps you through life. My intentions are
pure, I mean only to help you. Now that we have that cleared up we must
talk."</p>

<p>"About what?"</p>

<p>"About the one called Willow. The one you are in love with. You must tell
her how you feel."</p>

<p>"I can't, she already has someone, I have no right to interfere with her
happiness."</p>

<p>"You love her with all your heart that gives you every right. Besides who
is to say that she wouldn't be happier with you, besides her and the other
are not met t o be."</p>

<p>Fey looked at the blonde slayer and saw that she was not reaching the girl.
She let out a soft sigh; this was going to be much more difficult than she
had thought.</p>

<p>Buffy sat up in her bed as the first rays of the early morning sun filtered
in through the window. The words of her spirit guide filled her mind, as
she looked across the dorm room at her best friend. For a moment she
thought about waiting for Willow to wake up and reveal her feelings for the
redheaded hacker, then she remembered the smile that filled Willow's face
when she was with Tara. A tear rolled down the blondes cheek, she couldn't
tell Willow how she felt, Tara made Willow happy and she had no right to
interfere with that, no matter what her spirit guide said or how bad it hurt
her inside to be this close to Willow without being able to take her secret
love in her arms and never let go.</p>

<p>Buffy once again knocked on Giles door, hoping that he would not be to upset
with her for waking him up so early on a Saturday morning. She needed to
talk to someone about what had happened in her dream, minus the part about
being in love with Willow, no one could ever now about that.</p>

<p>A groggy Giles handed Buffy a cup of coffee and looked at his watch as he
sat down in the recliner across from her, "So what brings you here so early
in the morning," He inquired hoping that everything was fine.</p>

<p>Buffy took a moment to collect her thoughts, "I have a question about a
dream I had last night."</p>

<p>"Go ahead"</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard of a spirit guide?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but why do ask?"</p>

<p>"I met mine last night."</p>

<p>Giles eased back in his chair and pondered what Buffy had just said, "I see,
what did they say?"</p>

<p>"She said that she was to help guide me in my life and that her name was
Fey."</p>

<p>Giles stared at Buffy as he recalled the signature in the mysterious book,
"Could you repeat that last part please"</p>

<p>"She said her name was Fey," replied Buffy wondering why Giles seemed so
interested in her spirit guide's name.</p>

<p>Giles got up and walked into his bedroom; leaving Buffy sitting by herself.
The slayer looked at the door to her watcher's bedroom wondering what was
going on and why he had decided to suddenly leave once she confirmed Fey's
name. Buffy was about to get up and find out what Giles was doing when he
walked back into the room carrying a rather old looking book, &lt;Giles plus
old book equals trouble for me&gt;.</p>

<p>Giles sat back down across from the slayer and noticed the look of despair
that had come over her, "Buffy, is something wrong?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, usually when you start whipping out old books like that after I had a
dream it means that some major bad is about to happen."</p>

<p>Giles smiled and in a reassuring voice replied, "I don't think you have any
thing to worry about, this book is more a history lesson than a prophecy."</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Tara's dorm room…</p>

<p>Willow and Tara sat in the circle surrounded by candles. Willow took the
blonde's hand and stared into her deep blue eyes, "So tell me about this
spell you want to try?"</p>

<p>"I-it's a Divination spell. It should give insight to t-the future."</p>

<p>Willow took Tara's other hand and smiled, "Shall we begin."</p>

<p>The two girls began chanting the words from the spell book that lay on the
ground between them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Willow found herself standing in a vast prairie with no sign of
civilization in any direction, before her stood a young woman with dark
brown hair. "Do not be afraid young Wicca, I mean no harm."</p>

<p>Willow was unsure what to say so she blurted out the first thoughts that
came into her mind, "Who are you and why have you brought me here?"</p>

<p>"I am called Fey, and it was not me but your spell that brought you here.
What is it that you seek?"</p>

<p>Willow stood there for a moment wondering what to ask, then it dawned on
her. "In the past I have been rather unfortunate in the romance area. So
could you tell me, is Tara the one?"</p>

<p>"No, I am afraid it is not meant to be." Before Willow could ask another
question Fey was gone and she found herself back in the circle with Tara who
seemed to be in some kind of trance..</p>

<p>Tara looked around the familiar setting that was her mother's house
wondering why the spell had brought her here. She heard a voice call her
name and spun around hoping to once again see her Mom, but instead an old
friend of the family greeted her.</p>

<p>The blonde witch looked at the older woman and smiled, "Fey, why have you
brought me here?"</p>

<p>"To find out what is going on with you and to remind you why you were sent
to outer earth in the first place."</p>

</table>

<p>Willow sat within the circle gazing at Tara, her mind kept playing
Fey's words over and over, &lt;It is not met to be&gt;. A tear rolled down
Willow's cheek as she continued to wait for the blonde witch to come
out of the trance, What was happening with them, why did her vision
tell her Tara was not the one and nothing more. </p>

<p>Fey watched as Tara tried to avoid looking at her, "Child look at me
when I am speaking."</p>

<p>"S-s-sorry," replied Tara as she made eye contact with Fey.</p>

<p>"Did you forget why you were sent?"</p>

<p>"No." replied Tara, her voice barely above a whisper.</p>

<p>"Then could you refresh my memory, because it sure looks like you did
to me"</p>

<p>Tara lowered her head and looked at her feet as she began to
speak, "I was s-sent..."</p>

<p>Fey cut Tara off in mid-sentence, "I told you to look at me when you
are talking."</p>

<p>Tara lifted her head back up and continued, "To help the Willow," Fey
could barely hear Tara as she finished off the rest of the
sentence, "and the slayer."</p>

<p>Fey frowned at the girl when she saw that Tara was done speaking, "I
see that not only are you conveniently leaving off the rest of the
instructions I gave you when you where sent to outer earth from the
ethereal but you have altered them to the point where the slayer has
become a side note."</p>

<p>Fey then walked over to Tara and put her hand on the girls
shoulder, "Listen to me child, I have know your mother for a very
long time and you are like a daughter to me, but I can not permit you
this to continue any longer. You have permitted yourself fall in
love with the Wicca knowing that she is met for another and the time
has come for that to be corrected." </p>

<p>Fey paused for a moment and place her hand under Tara's chin, lifting
her head up so she could look the blonde directly in they eyes, "I am
afraid that no matter how much it pains you that you must fix what
you have broken and then work to accomplish what you were sent to do."</p>

<p>"B-b-but I l-l-love Willow."</p>

<p>"I know but you were sent to aid the slayer, to help her find the
love that she so desperately needs to make her whole."</p>

<p>Fey paused for a second to make sure that Tara was paying full
attention to her and when she was sure the girl was she continued, "I
told you before you even entered outer earth who it was that could
complete the slayer however you chose to ignore that and allowed
yourself to fall for her, creating a relationship that is breaking
the slayers heart." </p>

<p>Tara hung her head in shame knowing that everything Fey had said was
true. Tears started to freely flow down the blondes face as she
thought about what had to be done. "H-h-ow can I......make t-things
right?"</p>

<p>"I'm am afraid that there is only one way, you reveal everything.
Take the Wicca to the watcher and tell the two of them of your
mission, the nature of the Realms, and why this particular slayer is
more important than any other slayer before her. After you have
told them take the Wicca aside and reveal to the feelings the slayer
has for her and how she is the one who holds the key to the slayers
heart."</p>

<p>Tara nodded her head then softly asked, "After I have done all of
this will I be allowed to return home."</p>

<p>"I am afraid not child, you must then finish what you started."</p>

<p>"I don't understand what you're saying?"</p>

<p>"You have taken it upon yourself to help the Wicca how to unlock and
channel the magic that resides in her. Her powers can be of great
benefit to both the slayer and her, so you must continue to aid her
in reaching her full potential, but at the same time you must ensure
that you do not interfere with her relationship with the slayer."</p>

<p>Tara went to speak only to find herself sitting accrosed from
Willow. The redhead leaned over and wrapped her arms around
Tara. "I see you finally decided to come back to me," replied Willow
just before she placed a gentle kiss on the blondes forehead.</p>

<p>Tara jerked back and Willow could see that Tara was crying, "What's
wrong?"</p>

<p>Tara stared at Willow, she knew what she had to do and it was eating
away at her, "W-w-w-we have g-got to talk, but w-we have to go to G-g-giles first."</p>

<p>Willow wasn't sure what was going on with Tara but something deep
inside her was told her that her vision was fulfilling itself and
that her and Tara were nearing the end of their romance. "It's
getting late, can out wait till tomorrow?" asked Willow trying to
hold on to whatever it was that she and Tara had.</p>

<p>Tara gazed at Willow and smiled, "Yeah, it can wait till tomorrow,"
she replied </p>

<p>Buffy and Faith walked through the Northridge cemetery on there
nightly patrol. So far it had been a pretty uneventful night with
only three newly turned vampires deciding to show themselves.</p>

<p>So B, you five by five?"</p>

<p>"Not really ."</p>

<p>"What's up?"</p>

<p>"For one thing I just finished talking to Giles, who showed me a
rather interesting book."</p>

<p>Faith cringed and then replied, "It wasn't another one of those
pesky prophecies again was it?"</p>

<p>Buffy smiled when she heard Faith's question, recalling her reaction
when Giles had brought the book out earlier that day, "No it was
nothing like that. It was more like a history lesson on Hell's
mouths, vampires, and slayers."</p>

<p>Faith cringed again, "Ouch, history is even worst than prophecy."</p>

<p>Buffy couldn't help but laugh at the brunette, "I tend to agree, but
I did learn one thing that was very interesting."</p>

<p>"Go ahead B, spill it."</p>

<p>"You know that spirit guide I told you about this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, what about here," replied Faith, wondering where Buffy was
going with this.</p>

<p>"Giles thinks that she might be the one who wrote the slayer history
book he has."</p>

<p>"Interesting, so what does he think that means?:"</p>

<p>"Well he is not really sure but wants me to ask her when I see her
again."</p>

<p>After they had finished telling Faith about what was in the book the
slayers existed the Northridge cemetery and stated to make their way
towards South Pines cemetery to continue their patrol. </p>

<p>Willow walked into her and Buffy's dorm room still wondering what was
going on between her and Tara. She placed her backpack on her desk
and went over laid down on her bed, and closed her eyes hoping that
somehow she might be able to talk to this woman calling herself Fey
in her dreams.</p>

<p>"I heard you calling me in your dream state young Wicca"</p>

<p>Willow spun around as soon as she heard the voice, coming face to
face with the mysterious woman that she had encountered
earlier. "What's happening with Tara and me."</p>

<p>"What was not suppose to be is being undone."</p>

<p>"What's that suppose to mean?"</p>

<p>"As I told you in the vision, you and Tara are not met to be."</p>

<p>Willow's eyes filled with sorrow at Fey's words, "We both care for
one another, why can't it be?"</p>

<p>Fey walked over to Willow and put her hands on the redheads
shoulders, "Young Wicca when we last spoke you said that you have
been unlucky in the area of romance, is that correct."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you know why?"</p>

<p>Willow looked at Fey, wondering were this mysterious woman was taking
the conversation, "No, why?"</p>

<p>"Because you have yet to find your one true love, that special person
whose heart you hold the key to," Fey then paused for a second and
sighed, "Sadly the one you are met to be with has been by your side
for a long time now but the two of you have been unable to find one
another."</p>

<p>Willow woke up from her dream state wishing that Fey would have told
her who her this one true love was but the woman wouldn`t tell her
but instead had promised that soon her one true love would be
revealed. Willow sat up in her bed and allowed her eyes to adjust to
the dimly light dorm room. She knew now that she was going to loose
Tara but for some reason it did not hurt as bad as she thought it
would. Her mind recalled what Fey had said, &lt;There was someone out
there that she was met to be, someone who would fulfill her, make her
happy, someone who would love her like she deserved to be loved.&gt;
Willow looked at the empty bed on the other side of the room, &lt;She
did say that it was someone who had been by my side for a long time&gt;
she began to smile as she thought about her best friend and
protector, &lt;could I be that lucky.&gt;</p>

<p>Buffy and Faith had just reached the UC Sunnydale campus and were on
the final leg of the patrol when the brunette looked over at her
friend and fellow slayer, "So B, what is really bothering you, and
none of this I was just thinking about what Giles said today crap."</p>

<p>Buffy knew her fellow slayer was headed so she made an effort to side
step the issue, "Faith I honestly don't know what your talking about,
by the way have you heard the new Wallflowers CD yet."</p>

<p>Faith stopped dead and her tracks and stared Buffy dead in the
eyes, "I've been friends with you long enough to know better than
that B. I'm not about to fall for your little if I change the
subject she will forget about what we were talking about maneuver.
So I'm going to ask you again, what the hell is going on with you?"</p>

<p>Buffy looked at Faith and saw that the brunette wasn't going to drop
the issue, "It's about Willow and Tara?"</p>

<p>Faith saw the hurt that engulfed her friend as soon as she mentioned
the couple, "B, your jealous, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"It's worse than that, I'm in love with Willow."</p>

<p>"Have you told her."</p>

<p>"No, I can't. She's with Tara, she's happy, I can`t risk taking away
her happiness."</p>

<p>"Something tells me you could make her happy," Smirked Faith, "You
should tell her."</p>

<p>Buffy gave Faith an awkward smile then spoke, "Let's finish up patrol
so I can get back to the dorm and you can get back to Giles," after
she had finished speaking the slayer thought to herself, as long as
Willow is with Tara there is no way I'm going to tell her how I feel.</p>

<p>Ciarán stood on the outskirts of town his dark red eyes locked on the
sign that read Welcome to Sunnydale California. A wicked sneer
spread accrosed his face as he tossed a half smoked cigarette to the
ground and crushed under the heel an Armani boot. He then waved his
hand through the air and laughed as he watched the sign melt before
his eyes. </p>

<p>Tara sat at the table staring into Willow's eyes, a tear of
rolled
down her cheek as she thought about how the moment she had been
dreading since talking to Fey had finally come. It was time to make
things right and that met leading her friend and lover into the arms
of the slayer. She gathered all the inner strength she could,
fighting back the sorrow that was forming, then she broke they eye
contact with Willow and turned to the watcher, "Mr. Giles W-we
have a
lot to talk about... I am n-n-not what I appear to be."</p>

<p>Willow gazed at the blond Wicca, her mind questioning what Tara had
just said, "What do you mean by you're not what you appear to
be?"</p>

<p>"It's kinda of hard to explain without you knowing of the
nature of
the universe...p-please bare with me as I try to pass that knowledge
on to you."</p>

<p>Tara paused for a moment as she put her thought together, "There
are
two planes of existence, the earth and the Ethereal. Both of these
are divided into three realms, with each realm holding a particular
place in the balance of the universe."</p>

<p>Tara then waited for a moment to ensure that Willow and Giles were
grasping what she was saying. When she saw that they were she
continued, "The earth realms are know as Outer earth, The void,
and
Inner Earth. We are currently in outer earth which is the home of
humanity, it is the Outer earth that brings life to the universe.
Next is Inner earth which is known by man as Hell. It is the realm
of demons, it is the heart of darkness that brings chaos to the
universe."</p>

<p>Tara once again stopped allowing Willow and Giles to comprehend what
she was saying then continued, "Since the dawn of time Inner
earth
has sought to conquer and dominate outer earth, to keep that from
happening The Powers That Be created an Earth Realm know as the Void,
it is a great chasm that separates outer earth and inner earth. Its
inhabitants are mortal and divided into two groups. the first one
being the Sentinels who are the warriors of the void, tasked by the
powers that be to keep the demons from gaining passage into Outer
earth. The second group is the tribunal, a group of powerful mages
who work to keep Hell's mouths from opening up throughout the
world,
though as you both know they are not able to stop them all."</p>

<p>As soon as Tara paused Willow spoke up, her voice filled with
frustration, "Enough of this already, I mean I appreciate the
lesson
on the nature of the universe and everything but it doesn't
answer
what is going on between us, or why the sudden I feel like I am
losing you," tears began to roll down Willow's face,
"Tara what's
happening, why all the sudden does the universe seem bent on breaking
us up."</p>

<p>Tara felt a lump form in her through as she watched the sweet redhead
begin to cry, "I'm s-s-so," Tears began to roll down as
she saw the
pain all this was causing Willow, "sorry, I d-didn't mean to
cause
you pain."</p>

<p>"Tara, what's going on here seems to be beyond this realm,
it's not
your fault."</p>

<p>"Y-yes it is... I knew when I was sent here that your heart
belonged
to another b-but I messed everything up... I f-f-failed in my calling
by permitting myself to fall in love with you."</p>

<p>Willow looked at Tara through tear stained eyes wondering what the
blonde was talking about, "I don't understand. What are you
talking
about?"</p>

<p>"I am not of any of the earth realms, but from the Ethereal
plane.
Please bare with me a little longer and I will explain all of your
questions."</p>

<p>Giles leaned back in his chair as he pondered what had just been
said, Willow wiped the tears away from her eyes and nodded to Tara to
continue. Both of them knowing that their lives were going to change
forever when the blonde Wicca once again started to speak.</p>

<p>"I was sent here from the Ethereal to help...but to this point I
have
f-failed to accomplish what I was sent for, but before I can go into
that there are a few things you must know about the Ethereal. First
of all no one in the Ethereal is mortal. and second the ethereal like
the Earth is divided into realms. There is the lower Ethereal which
you probably know by one of it's several names; the hereafter,
the
afterlife, the forever, and so forth. It is where the souls of the
mortals from outer earth and the void go once they pass into the
great beyond. Then comes the realm that I am from, it is the middle
Ethereal, and is the home of the immortals."</p>

<p>Willow stood up from here chair and stared at Tara, "Your
immortal."</p>

<p>"Y-yes, and I will explain what that means and why I am here
shortly."</p>

<p>Willow sat back down, looked directly at Tara and motioned for her
to continue.</p>

<p>"After the middle Ethereal comes the Upper Ethereal which is the
home
of the powers that be also referred to as Gods and Goddesses. They
are the ones who watch over the entire universe and ensure that the
proper balance life maintained."</p>

<p>Tara looked at Giles for a moment to see if he was following all of
this. She then turned her attention to Willow, as her eyes looked
with the redheads she let out a deep sigh, knowing that it was time
to let Willow go. "I am immortal, and when I met you a little
over a
year ago it was the first time I had ever set foot on outer
earth.....I was sent here by Fey. She sent me here to a-aid the s-
slayer and not only h-have I f-failed, I also have managed to cause
you and the s-s-slayer pain and for that I am truly s-sorry."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by you have failed Buffy," inquired Willow</p>

<p>Giles stood up and stared at Tara, the blonde which felt as if he was
shooting sharp daggers into her with his eyes. The watchers voice
was filled with anger as he considered that somehow this blonde witch
had done something to harm his surrogate daughter, "How did you
fail
Buffy and what have you done that has hurt her and Willow."</p>

<p>"I was sent to help B-b-b-...the
slayer...findtheonewhoholdsthekeytoherheart,"</p>

<p>Giles gazed at Tara, "Would you mind repeating that again
please."</p>

<p>"I was sent by Fey in the name of the powers that be to help her
find
the one p-person who could bring t-true love to her life."</p>

<p>Giles let what Tara had just said sink end for a moment, "Why
are
the powers that be so concerned with Buffy's love life."</p>

<p>"Because she is different than any other slayer before her. The
prophetic visions that she has are only the beginning of what she is
truly capable of, her potential is so great that not even she knows
what it is that she is becoming. You see for every generation a
warrior is called to fight against the inhabitants of Inner earth and
the vampires of Outer earth."</p>

<p>Giles interrupted Tara in mid sentence, "We already know this,
what I
need to know is what is it that makes Buffy important enough to the
powers that be that they would send an immortal to help her find true
love."</p>

<p>"S-she is not just any slayer, she is the ultimate slayer, one
whose
skills are so powerful that the powers that be will not allow them to
be fully unlocked until she finds her one true love, one who will
bring the balance to her life and keep her from being consumed by the
slayer she is to be."</p>

<p>Tara got up from her chair and walked around to where Willow was
setting, she dropped down on her knees before the redhead and took
the girls hands in her own. Tears began to freely flow down
Tara's
cheeks, "I c-c-can't be with y-you.....w-we were never
suppose to b-
be together, your heart b-belongs to a-another."</p>

<p>Willow looked down at the girl who was kneeling before her, she wiped
away a tear from the blondes eye, as she did everything that Tara was
saying came crashing down on her at once and she knew, "Buffy,
it's
Buffy that I am met to be with." As she spoke both tears of
sorrow
over The end of her relationship with Tara and tears of joy of a
possible future with Buffy filled her eyes.</p>

<p>"Y-y-yes, you are the one who h-hold the key to the slayers
heart,
it's you that she thinks of as she falls into sleep and when she
first awakes." Tara stood up and placed her hand gently on
Willows
shoulder, the blonde was openly sobbing and could barely force
herself to speak, "I w-will always be your f-f-friend but the s-
slayer l-loves you....g-go to her and s-s-show her t-true love."</p>

<p>Willow got up to leave but then looked at Tara, "Are you going to
be
O.K."</p>

<p>As Tara responded to Willow she could feel her heart breaking,
"Y-yes, now go to her."</p>

<p>Willow turned to Giles wanting to ask for his help but before she
could form any words the watcher began to speak, "Willow I'll
make
sure she's alright and that she gets home safely, Go to
Buffy."</p>

<p>The two slayers had been out on patrol for a half hour and Buffy had
yet to mention anything about Willow or last nights conversation and
it was driving Faith nuts.</p>

<p>"So B, slow night so far."</p>

<p>"Yeah I guess, but we haven't been out that long."</p>

<p>"Good point, want to talk."</p>

<p>"'bout what."</p>

<p>"I don`t know, how about a certain redhead you happen to be
crushing
on."</p>

<p>Buffy spent around with fire in her eyes, "No, we have already
talked
about that way to much besides you should mind your own business and
stay out of mine!"</p>

<p>Faith took a couple steps back from the blonde slayer, "Easy B,
no
need to bite my head off, I only wanted to help."</p>

<p>"Sorry, Faith. It's just that.."</p>

<p>"Just what."</p>

<p>"Well I really wanted to spend some time with Willow after
classes
today, you know just to hang out."</p>

<p>"And"</p>

<p>"And she spent the whole afternoon with Tara, I didn't even
get to
see her before I left for patrol. I just guess I am a little more
jealous than I thought."</p>

<p>"That's an understatement if I ever heard one. You still
haven't
told her have you."</p>

<p>Buffy's lack of an answer told the brunette everything she needed
to
know, "It's not right B, you need to tell Red how you
feel."</p>

<p>"I can't, she's with Tara now, I've already missed my
chance."</p>

<p>"That's bull B and you know it, you're just to afraid to
`fess up. I
swear if you don't tell Red I will."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't dare."</p>

<p>"It would be for your own good, besides I am sick of seeing you
mope
around gawking over Willow, tell her you might be surprised by the
results."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean I have seen the way Willow looks at you, I think she
might
have a thing for a certain blonde slayer who resembles you."</p>

<p>Buffy looked at cursorily looked at her fellow slayer, "You're
nuts
Willow couldn't possibly feel that way about me."</p>

<p>"And you're selling yourself short. If I swung that way I
wouldn't
think twice about putting a move on you."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled at Faith, "Thanks, now can we get back to
patrol."</p>

<p>"O.K., but I'm going to give you a week to get up enough
courage to
tell Red how you feel, then if you haven't come clean I'm
telling."</p>

<p>Ciarán walked through the burnt out hallway of the high school
gradually making his way to the basement. He could feel the
Hellmouth calling out to him guiding him to it's weakest point.
He
made his way down the stairs and over to the large crack in the
ground, Ciarán then knelt down and placed his hand above the
crack,
he could feel the dark energy trapped behind the closed Hellmouth.
He then heard someone approaching from behind him, slowly he stood up
and spoke to the man who had entered the basement behind him,
"Nice
of you to make it Ethan."</p>

<p>Ethan Rayne Froze dead in his tracks as the mysterious figure spoke
his name. He had returned to try and seek revenge against Giles and
the slayer only to be drawn here by a dark power that he had not felt
in years, and now he stood before the holder of that power. Ethan
looked at the man who stood before him, he was an impressive six feet
tall and was completely decked out in black leather. The man had
short jet black hair and deep blood red eyes that seemed to shoot
through his soul. It took him a moment to realize just who it was
that he was standing before and as soon as he did Ethan dropped to
the ground and bowed before Ciarán, "Master, you have
returned."</p>

<p>Buffy walked into the dorm room and saw Willow sitting on the edge of
her bed, the
red heads eyes seemed to be filled with bliss as she smiled and
motioned for Buffy to come join her. The slayer walked over to her
friend wondering what was going on,
"Hi Wills, what's up?."</p>

<p>Willow looked up at her and patted the bed to indicate she wanted
Buffy to sit next to her, "Have a seat Buffy, I need to talk to you."</p>

<p>After Buffy had sat down Willow grabbed her hand, and looked the
blonde in the eyes, "Do you believe in destiny?"</p>

<p>"I'm the slayer, destiny is practically my middle name," Buffy
replied. She then paused for a moment pondering what was going
on, "Willow, what`s happening here?"</p>

<p>"I really don't know where to begin. I guess the best place would be
that Me and Tara are now officially only just friends, whatever we
had before is over."</p>

<p>Buffy couldn't find the words to say to Willow. She wasn't sure what
had happened between the two Wiccan but knew that most likely her
friend was hurting. On one hand she was upset that something had
happened to end Willows relationship with Tara causing the beautiful
red head pain, but in the other hand she was secretly jumping for joy
now that Tara appeared to be out of the picture as far as Willow`s
love life went. Maybe she had a chance, maybe Willow could love her
like she loved Willow.</p>

<p>Willow waited for Buffy's reply but got none, she looked into the
slayers light blue eyes and saw a mixture of emotions. There was
confusion, doubt, hopefulness, but mostly there was love. She felt
tears began to form as she realized how true Tara's words had been,
Buffy loved her, they were meant to be together.</p>

<p>Willow moved closer to the slayer, as she did she could hear Buffy's
heart rapidly pulsating, she wrapped her arm around Buffy and
tenderly pulled the slayer towards her. Buffy gazed over at Willow,
her voice filled with confusion and excitement, "OK this is nice but
you still haven't answered me, what's going on?"</p>

<p>Willow sweetly smiled at her, "The reason we broke up was that we
simply were simply not meant to be together, My heart belongs.....to
you."</p>

<p>Buffy felt a wave of joy sweep over her as she finally heard the
words she had yearned to hear for over a year. Tears rolled down her
cheeks as she took Willow in her arms, she tried to speak, tried to
tell Willow how much she loved her but the words were drowned in a
sea of joy and happiness. All she could do is rest her head on the
red heads shoulder and softly sob as all her hopes and dreams came
true.</p>

<p>Willow gently kissed Buffy on the forehead as she ran her fingers
through the slayers hair, "I love you."</p>

<p>The slayer looked up and gazed into Willows eyes, "I love you too."</p>

<p>Willow reached over and brushed the tears from Buffy's eyes, she then
leaned over placing a tender kiss against the slayers soft lips.
Buffy felt her heart miss a beat as Willows lips pressed against
hers, after the kiss was over she found herself longing for more so
she pulled Willow down on the bed beside her and affectionately
returned the Kiss as the two of them held each other in a loving
embrace. </p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Tara sat at her desk, she knew she had done the right thing but that
knowledge did little to comfort her from the pain that was eating at
her heart. She got up and was about to go to bed when a voice spoke
to her, "Child I know you are in great pain but there is something
that requires your immediate attention"</p>

<p>Tara looked around and saw the room was empty, she knew that Fey was
contacting her telepathically from the Ethereal. She closed her eyes
and sent back a reply,
 "What."</p>

<p>"A great darkness is coming and all their lives are in danger."</p>

<p>"What is this darkness, whose lives?"</p>

<p>"A powerful warlock named Ciarán has emerged, he seeks to gain the
power of the Hellmouth. He is a great threat to the slayer and all
those who care for her, you must go and contact the watcher before it
is to late."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>In the Ethereal the warrior Alexandria and her soulmate Sabryn looked
down upon the slayer and her newfound love as they cuddled up against
one another in their slumber.. Sabryn turned to the blonde
immortal, "They have found on another, it seems that Fey's talk with
the Tara worked."</p>

<p>Alexandria smiled as she returned the red heads glance, "Yes, and now
it is time for us to visit them so the slayers full potential can be
released."</p>

<p>Moments later in the dream world......</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow stood hand in hand in the middle of a rich green
meadow, off to their right was a babbling brook with two women
standing next to it. One of the women was a blonde wearing chain
mail armor, with a sheathed sword at her side. The other was a red
head wearing blue robes and carrying a staff. The blond women
motioned for Buffy and Willow to come join them, "Come Slayer we have
much to talk about."</p>

<p>Buffy protectively wrapped an arm around Willow, "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"We are friends of Morgan Le Fey, I am called Alexandria and this is
my beloved Sabryn." answered the Blond.</p>

<p>Buffy looked at Alexandria, her face clearly showing the shock the
woman's name had caused, "Are you the same Alexandria that was in
book Fey gave Giles, the one who calls the slayers."</p>

<p>"Yes"</p>

<p>"Why have you brought us here."</p>

<p>"Do you remember when the first slayer came to talk to you."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Buffy wondering where this was going.</p>

<p>"Do you recall how you were told that you have not yet become all you
were meant to be?"</p>

<p>Buffy nodded her head as she clung to Willow.</p>

<p>"The time has come to correct that, you and your beloved were brought
here so that your true potential could be unleashed."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Giles sat starring at the young blond who sat at the table accrosed
from him, his hands were visibly shaking as a result of the message
she had brought. Ciarán after all these years had reemerged. He
shuttered at the thought of the warlock who once lead the dark coven
of his youth of getting anywhere near Sunnydale. He thought about
the last time his past had returned when Ethan Rayne came to town and
tried to ruin their lives, but this was different, Ciarán was more
powerful than any witch or warlock he had ever encountered. While
Ethan had been essentially evil Ciarán made him look like a
boyscout. Giles let out a sigh of desperation, what were they to do,
how could they a warlock so powerful that those who followed him
called him master. </p>

<p>Buffy felt Willow in her arms as she awoke, the slayer smiled as she
remembered the events of last night that had brought them to this
point. She knew that she should get up and begin her morning workout
routine before getting ready for classes but she didn't. Instead
she
laid there in Willows arms and watched her sleep, trying to hold on
to the magic of last night just a little longer.</p>

<p>Willow opened her eyes to see Buffy gazing into them and
smiled, "Uh, how long have you been up?"</p>

<p>"About two hours."</p>

<p>"And you been laying her the whole time," questioned Willow,
after
all Buffy usually had worked out and showered before she even got up.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I kinda wanted to bask in the moment. I know that
probably
sounds sappy and everything, but it is the truth."</p>

<p>"No, I think it sounds sweet," replied Willow just before
giving
Buffy light kiss.</p>

<p>Just then there was a loud knocking at the door, Buffy frowned and
got up, "looks like the moments over."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but it was only the beginning, I have a feeling we are
going
to be together for a long long time."</p>

<p>Buffy turned to Willow form the door and smiled, "You mean
that."</p>

<p>"Of course I do, now that I finally found you I have no intention
of
ever letting you go."</p>

<p>"Ditto," replied the slayer before rather forcefully jerking
the door
open. "Faith what in the world are you doing knocking on our
door at
7:30 in the morning!"</p>

<p>Faith stood there for a moment like a deer caught in the headlight of
an oncoming Truck, She could tell that the blond slayer was not at
all happy at being disturbed and was afraid she might take it out on
her. She took a rather large gulp of air, "B the G-man sent me
to
get you and Willow, something about needing you two to skip classes
so we can come up with a battle plan."</p>

<p>The fire in Buffy's eyes quickly dwindled and was replaced by
concern, Giles wouldn't send Faith to get them and have them skip
classes unless it was something big."</p>

<p>Willow walked over to the door, put her head on Buffy's shoulder,
and
wrapped her arms around her loves waist, which resulted in a very
wide cat who just at the canary smile from Faith, "Told ya so
B."</p>

<p>Buffy just grinned at the other slayer as she placed her arm around
Willow. The red head looked at Faith then to Buffy, "What did
she
tell you."</p>

<p>Buffy blushed at Willows question, "I'll tell you later,
right now
Giles wants us to skip classes and get over to his place."</p>

<p>"It's not the end of the world, is it," inquires Willow.</p>

<p>Buffy looked to Faith for a answer but the brunette just shrugged her
shoulders, "He didn't say Red."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>The three girls walked into Giles living room and saw that Xander and
Anya were already their along with Tara. Buffy immediately put her
arm around Willow and pulled the red head close to her. She then
cocked her head towards Faith and whispered, "What is she doing
here?"</p>

<p>"Easy B, I'll go find out," Faith then walked over to
Giles and
pulled him aside.</p>

<p>Tara nervously fidgeted in her chair, she could feel the coldness
towards her in the steel blue eyes of the slayer. The slayers gaze
seemed to penetrate into her soul like a sharp daggers, and she
found herself wishing she was anywhere but there.</p>

<p>Willow looked at Tara and saw that her former girlfriend was staring
in their direction with a look of panic in her eyes. She turned to
her love to see Buffy coldly staring at Tara, "Buffy, could we
step
outside to talk for a moment."</p>

<p>Willow looked at Buffy as the two of them stood outside Giles
house, "What were you doing in there?"</p>

<p>"Nothing I was just waiting for Faith to come back over from
talking
to Giles."</p>

<p>"Are you sure, because it looked like you where about to stake
Tara."</p>

<p>Buffy lowered her head so she didn't have to look at Willow when
she
answered, "I didn't mean to it's just that when I saw
here there
everything came back, how you two where together and I was caught on
the outside loving you, I guess I was just afraid that she might try
to get you back."</p>

<p>Willow placed her hand under Buffy's chin and lifted it up so she
could look her best friend and lover in the eyes, "Listen to me.
I'm
not with Tara anymore, I'm with you and that's where I plan
on
staying. There is nothing that Tara or anyone else could ever do to
make me leave you. I love you more than I have loved anyone or
anything in my life and that's never going to change."</p>

<p>A tear rolled down Buffy's cheek as she heard the truthfulness in
Willow's words, she embraced the red head almost lifting her off
the
ground, "Oh My God, I love you so much that I can`t even
find the
words to tell you."</p>

<p>Willow tapped Buffy on the .shoulder, "This is nice but air is
starting to become an issue,"</p>

<p>Buffy loosened her grip on Willow so and the red head took a couple
deep breaths. Sorry about that, I guess I got carried away."</p>

<p>"That's OK, if you going to get carried away I can't
think of a
better way than loving me."</p>

<p>Faith cleared her throat from the doorway, "Uh, B are you about
done
or ya gonna need more time."</p>

<p>Buffy broke the embrace with Willow and turned to Faith leaving one
of her arms wrapped around Willows waste. "We're done."</p>

<p>Faith closed the door and walked over to new couple, "He said
that
she is here to help, and that you don't have anything to worry
about."</p>

<p>"Thanks, I guess we should go back in and find out what's up."</p>

<p>The rest of the group watched as the three girls walked into Giles
living room for the second time in a half hour. Buffy walked over to
the table and sat down then pulled Willow into her lap which got wide
stares from Xander and Anya, "well are we going to sit around
here
all morning or are we going to talk about how Me and Faith are going
to slay whatever big nasty decided to show up this time."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's not that simple, it appears that once
again my past
has come back to create problems for us."</p>

<p>"Is it Ethan again?" </p>

<p>"No, That would be a lot easier to deal with. It seems a warlock
I
knew in my darker days called Ciarán is planning to attempt to
increase his power through the Hellmouth."</p>

<p>"So we get Red and Blondie to use some magic to distract him and
Me
and B will keep care of him," Quipped Faith</p>

<p>"It's not going to be easy, for one thing Ciarán is
extremely
powerful, and also we don't know where he is at or if he is even
here
yet."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Maggie was straightening up the counter of the magic shop when she
noticed to men walk in and immediately head over to the counter. Foe
some reason she felt the sudden urge to close up shop and get as far
away from these two men as she could, there was something very wrong
with aura they were putting out, "May I help you?"</p>

<p>Ciarán looked at the Witch who ran this magic shop, "I hope
so, we
seek a tome of demon summoning?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry but I do not carry that type of material."</p>

<p>"What ashamed, tell me this then do you know where I can find a
suitable sacrifice."</p>

<p>Maggie reached her hand under the counter and started feeling for the
button that would trigger the alarm notifying the police,
"I-i'm g-
going t-to h-have to a-ask you to
l-l-leave."</p>

<p>Ciarán placed his hand in front of Maggie's face revealing the
Symbol
of Tursa
on his palm, he then moved his hand counterclockwise through the air
causing the shop owner to pass out. Ciarán then turned to Ethan,
"She
will do."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"So B, you decided to tell her I see," inquired Faith as the
two
slayers walked through the cemetery on patrol.</p>

<p>"Actually she told me when I came home from patrol last night"</p>

<p>"Wicked cool, so as Anya would say are the two of you..."</p>

<p>Buffy quickly cut off her friend when she saw where this conversation
was headed, "Don't even think of finishing that sentence."</p>

<p>"OK, I'll stop."</p>

<p>Buffy stopped in her tracts, "Faith I think we got company."</p>

<p>A dozen vampires made their way out from behind a row of tombstones
and started heading towards the two slayers. "You ready,"
asked Buffy</p>

<p>"Ready as I'm gonna get."</p>

<p>Faith took up a fighting stance as Buffy soared through the air
catching on of the vampires on the chin with a flying roundhouse
sending him flying backwards. She hit another vampire with a solid
left hook knocking him down. Two other rushed at her only to be
mysteriously thrown back when Buffy threw her hands up in defense.</p>

<p>Faith found herself surrounded by three vampires. She quickly
knocked one down with a series of jabs and uppercuts. One of the
vampires then managed to knock her to the ground, but Faith rolled
out of the way as he went to jump on her. She quickly got to her
knees and staked the vamp before h e could get back up. The third
vampire charged her swinging wildly at the brunette slayer, but Faith
blocked off his attack.</p>

<p>Buffy had already staked five of the nine vampires she was fighting
when two of them grabbed her from behind. The remaining two started
to close in on her. She stomped down hard on the vampire to her
left's foot causing him to let go, she broke the grip of the
other
vamp and flung him into the oncoming vamps, knocking them down. She
spun around so that she was facing the vampire who she hand foot
stomped. He took a swing at her only to have the slayer catch his
fist. Buffy then squeezed down tightly on it crushing every bone in
his hand. When the vampire dropped to his knees Buffy grabbed him by
the head and literally ripped it off turning him to dust. She then
took a stake in both hands and tossed them threw the air vaporizing
two more vampires. The remaining vampire looked at the slayer and
then sprinted off into the night as fast has his legs would carry him.</p>

<p>Faith stood there staring at the blond slayer, she couldn't
believe
what she had witnessed after finishing off the last vamp that had
charged her. Buffy had moved faster than she thought was possible
even for a slayer, and the strength she displayed by ripping off the
vampires had was amazing, but what really held her in awe was the
fact that Buffy had somehow thrown vampires backwards without even
touching them. "B that was amazing, how'd ya do it."</p>

<p>"I'm not really sure, I think we should call it a night,
could you
brief Giles for me, and tell him that I'll talk to him
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"B, what you just did was beyond impressive, don't you think
you
should let him know sooner."</p>

<p>Buffy looked at Faith and spoke with extreme authority, "I got to
get
home to Willow, it can wait."</p>

<p>Faith grinned at the blond slayer, "Point taken, Have fun."</p>

<p>Time seemed to be standing still for Willow as she waited for Buffy
to return from patrol, she anxiously paced back and forth across
their room, periodically glancing at the door. In the past she had
always worried about the slayer when she was out on parole but now
that they had discovered one another that worry was ten times
greater. Willow could feel here heart pounding rhythmically with the
ticking of the clock, each beat indicating another second that her
new love was out amongst the darkness and away from her.'</p>

<p>As soon as Buffy walked into her room Willows arms were tightly
wrapped around her. Buffy then smiled as she affectionately embraced
Willow, "I take it that you missed me."</p>

<p>"Yeah, plus I was worried about you." </p>

<p>"Well I'm here now, so there's no need to worry," Buffy
then
tenderly assaulted Willows lips with a barrage of affectionate kisses.</p>

<p>After both girls regained there breath Buffy took Willow by the hand
and led the red head over to her bed. She then sat down and pulled
Willow onto her lap, wrapping her arms around her loves waste in the
process. "Have I told you recently how much I love you,"
replied
Buffy, her voice filled with passion.</p>

<p>Smiling Willow rested her head up against Buffy's shoulder,
"Yeah,
right before you left for parole."</p>

<p>"Well then I have got some time to make up for, that's
entirely to
long," replied Buffy with a mischievous smile. The slayer then
leaned over and flipped the light switch. </p>

<p>Meanwhile on the other side of Sunnydale..............</p>

<p>The cold body of his victim laid at Ciarán's feet as he stood
before
the Hellmouth,
"Tursa , ruler of destruction and creator of evil I evoke thy
ancient
name, grant me entrance unto the Realm of Demons." </p>

<p>As Ciarán's spoke a red cloud of smoke began to pour from the
base of
the Hellmouth and the earth began to shake. Then a bright blue
light shined from the expanding crack in the earth, and he could feel
the dark power behind the Hellmouth begin to envelope him, soon he
would be unstoppable, soon the world itself would bow before him.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>A messenger burst into the meeting chamber of the tribunal of mages
within the void. The twelve mages of the council looked at the young
messenger and saw the despair that filled his face, "What news do
ye
bring," inquired Catalina, the head of the Tribunal.</p>

<p>Panic filled the messengers voice as he stood before the mages,
"A
warlock is attempting to open a Hellmouth."</p>

<p>Upon hearing the news the mages quickly gathered around the large
crystal in the center of the chamber, they then all inner locked
their hands forming a circle. As the mages began focusing their
Psionic energy onto the crystal they could see Ciarán performing
his
dark magic. They increased their energies concentrating on the
rapidly opening Hellmouth.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Ciarán clenched his fist as he gazed at what was now nothing more
than a crack in the earth, he bent over and moved his hand over the
closed Hellmouth, the power that was almost his was still trapped
behind it. Hatred filled his eyes as he turned to Ethan, "It was
suppose to have been mine."</p>

<p>Ethan's voice was laced with fear as he addressed the enraged
warlock, "What happened my master?"</p>

<p>"Someone powerful in the magic arts has moved against me, and
prevented the opening of the Hellmouth."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, but I intend to find out, and when I do I will
destroy them and then make the power of the Hellmouth mine."</p>

<p>Ciarán then walked over to the stairs, "I require information
on who
might be powerful enough to break my spell. Come Ethan, we have an
old friend to visit."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Joyce leaned up against Giles as the two of them sat on the couch
curiously watching the Brunette slayer seated across from them.
"You
said you have to talk to us about Buffy," inquired a very
concerned
Rupert Giles.</p>

<p>"Yeah, well B probably could explain what happened tonight
better,
but she said it could wait till morning, something about getting home
to Willow and.."</p>

<p>Giles quickly cut of Faith in mid sentence, "Uh, That's quite
enough
information on why Buffy's not here, could you please get back to
what you where originally talking about."</p>

<p>Joyce removed her head from Giles shoulder and leaned forward on the
couch, "Faith, Rupert is quite right, what happened tonight with
my
daughter."</p>

<p>"Well it's kinda like this. It was sorta a busy night, you
know lots
of vamps out. G-man the way B slayed them was amazing."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by amazing?"</p>

<p>"It's kinda hard to explain."</p>

<p>"Well try"</p>

<p>"For one thing she moved faster than I thought possible. I mean
she
was moving from one vamp to another before they knew what hit them.
Then there was her strength, I mean I know B is pretty strong but
this was different."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by different?"</p>

<p>"G, I saw her rip the head off of one of the vamps and throw
another
one twenty feet through the air like he was a stuffed toy."</p>

<p>Giles got up and started pacing back and forth as he pondered what
all of this meant. Faith got up and stood in front of him in order
to stop his pacing, "G, you might want to sit back down.
There's
more and it's a biggie."</p>

<p>Giles rejoined Joyce on the couch, then looked to Faith., "OK,
I'm
sitting, go ahead."</p>

<p>"She somehow was throwing vamps around without even touching them
or
being close to them, I swear one time I think I saw her dust a vamp
by giving him a dirty look."</p>

<p>Before Giles could reply to what Faith had just said there was a
rather loud knock at the door. He got up of the couch and kissed
Joyce on the forehead, "I`ll be right back," he then
quickly glanced
at Faith before heading towards the door, "As soon as I get back
I
have several questions for you."</p>

<p>Joyce and Faith both waited as Giles went to answer the door,
suddenly they heard him scream out in terror, "Oh my God. Joyce,
Faith. Run, get out of here now!"</p>

<p align=right><a class=link href="#top">Top</a></p>

<p>Both Women jumped up from there seats when they heard Giles plea to
run, Faith quickly rushed towards the door way to see what he was
yelling about. She rounded the corner and spotted Ethan Rayne and
another man standing in the door way, Giles was paying no attention
whatsoever to Ethan as he focused all of his attention on the other
man. </p>

<p>Giles looked at the warlock, his body was visibly trembling from
fear, "Ciarán, why have you come here, what do you want?"</p>

<p>Ciarán motioned his hand through the air and a unseen force tossed
Giles aside. The warlock then walked into the house with Ethan in
tow, His fiery red eyes locked on the ex-watcher, "Ethan tells me you
went soft Rupert, what a shame, you had such potential."</p>

<p>Ciarán walked over to Giles and leaned down putting both his hands
on Giles shoulders, "Tell me are you still the little researcher I
used to know."</p>

<p>Faith couldn't believe what was happening but she was determined to
put a stop to it. She screamed at the mysterious man who had somehow
just attacked Giles, "Get away from him!"</p>

<p>Giles shot the Brunette slayer, who was slowly advancing towards
them, a look of pure panic, "Faith no!"</p>

<p>Ciarán turned away from Giles and glared at Faith. "You're way out of
your league little girl," replied the warlock as he threw his hand
out towards Faith, sending her flying backwards through the hallway.</p>

<p>After Faith hit the ground she looked over into the living room at
Joyce, "Run, get B."</p>

<p>It took Joyce a moment to comprehend what was happening but as soon
as she did the she made a rapid break for the back door, only to find
that it somehow had been sealed. She slowly walked back into the
living room and saw that Giles and Faith were sitting on the couch,
with the two men standing behind them.</p>

<p>"Come join us," replied Ciarán.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Immediately after falling asleep in one another's arms Buffy and
Willow found themselves in the dream world. They were in a rather
large room lit solely by thousands of candles, their where small
murals covering three walls that depicted the history of the slayers,
with a rather large painting of the two of them that took up an
entire wall. Buffy sat down in a rather large oversized chair and
pulled Willow onto her lap, "I think it`s a pretty good likeness, how
about you?"</p>

<p>"I agree, but why is it here, and where is here."</p>

<p>"Slayer, please allow me to explain," Replied Fey as she walked into
the room via a hidden door, "This is Alexandria's castle, and you are
in the hall of the Slayers."</p>

<p>"OK, now we no the where, so how about the why."</p>

<p>"To give you a sense of what you are and what you are becoming now
that your full potential has been released. Look around you, each on
of the pictures represents a slayer, each one of them is a
predecessor to you."</p>

<p>Fey walked over to the large portrait of Buffy and Willow and pointed
at it, "Do you know why unlike the other portraits you are not
depicted alone or why the picture of the two of you is larger than
the others."</p>

<p>"Tara told us she is to become the ultimate slayer, is that why,"
questioned Willow.</p>

<p>"Well done young mage, but that is only partially correct. Yes, Tara
did tell you that your beloved is to be the ultimate slayer, however
you must know that as soon as the two of you found one another The
Powers that Be transformed her into the ultimate slayer. Also know
that the reason you are in the picture is not because of her being
this great warrior but because the two of you are soul mates."</p>

<p>Willow looked at Buffy, before turning her attention back to
Fey, "If that is true why are all the others slayers shown alone?"</p>

<p>Fey`s immortal eyes filled with sadness, she walked over to the two
girls and placed a hand on each of them. Fey looked directly into
Willows eyes, "She is the only slayer ever to find her soul mate."
A tear rolled down Fey's cheek as she turned her attention to
Buffy, "Cherish the love you have with the young mage," Fey then made
a sweeping motion around the room as if pointing out every single
picture on the walls, "It is something none of your sisters before
you where able to find."</p>

<p>Fey's words struck the slayer in her very core, she slowly looked
around the room carefully studying each picture on the wall as tears
of sorrow for the other slayers filled her eyes. Buffy tightly
wrapped her arms around Willow, "I will," replied Buffy, "I will."</p>

<p>Suddenly Fey's eyes grew wide with alarm, "The watcher and the others
are in grave danger you must return and get Tara then go to them."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Giles could feel the waves of pain shoot through his body as Ciarán
once again magically attacked him. "I'm not going ask again Rupert,
tell me what you know of the Hellmouth."</p>

<p>"Never," cried out Giles in agony.</p>

<p>Ciarán gazed into the ex-watchers eyes for a moment before turning to
take a quick glance at the two women who where had been restrained in
chairs. "Maybe I have been going about this wrong. It would appear
that their is nothing I can do to you to make you give me the
knowledge I need."</p>

<p>Ciarán walked over and stood between Joyce and Faith, He pulled out
a large silver dagger from beneath his cloak and sinisterly smiled at
Giles, "So which one shall it be. Your slayer or your lover."</p>

<p>"Please, I beg of you....don't."</p>

<p>"Then tell me what I want to know or one of them is about to die."</p>

<p>Giles gazed over at Joyce and Faith before hanging his head in shame
over what he was about to do, "where do you wish me to start,"
inquired a broken Giles as Ciarán laughed knowing he had one this
battle.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy looked at the door to Giles house which was ajar, she knew
there was no way he would leave his house open like that, especially
at night. </p>

<p>"Willow you and Tara stay here, I'm going in."</p>

<p>Buffy silently crept into Giles house and immediately knew that
something was wrong, the living room was littered with all of his
books and furniture was tossed all over the place. She then stopped
dead in her tracts, "Willow, I need your help."</p>

<p>Willow rushed into the house with Tara right behind her, Faith was
lying on the floor, with Buffy kneeling next to her over her. "Oh,
my god, is she..."</p>

<p>"No, but she is hurt pretty bad."</p>

<p>Faith`s voice was so weak Buffy could barely hear it, "B forget about
me, I'll survive. You got to find them."</p>

<p>"Find who?"</p>

<p>"Giles and your mom, he took them."</p>

<p>Faith's words struck Buffy square in the heart, not only had someone
trashed her watchers house and hurt her friend and fellow slayer, but
they had taken Giles and her Mom, "Faith, who took them."</p>

<p>"Ciarán and Ethan."</p>

<p>Buffy stood up and faced Willow, her eyes where filled with rage
towards this Ciarán, "Willow you stay here with Faith and Tara, I'm
going to go get Giles and my mom back."</p>

<p>Tara carefully approached the slayer, "I d-don't think that....m-
might be the best thing to do. Fey told me that..... Ciarán is a
very p-powerful warlock."</p>

<p>Willow comfortingly embraced Buffy, "Sweetheart she's right, look
what he did here, we need to come up with a plan and possibly get
some help."</p>

<p>Buffy considered what her love had said and knew the red head was
right, "OK, but whatever we do we have to do it fast, I have a really
bad feeling about all of this."</p>

<p>Willow thought for a moment and then it dawned on her, "Tara, I need
you to try and contact Fey. Let her know what happened and see if
she can aid us. Buffy take Faith to her room so she can get some
rest and heal up, I'm going to call LA and try and reach Angel, he
might just be able to help."</p>

<p>"Why have you come," asked the first oracle.</p>

<p>"What is it you seek," asked the second.</p>

<p>"I come because a warlock called Ciarán has kidnapped The Watcher and
one slayers Mom and harmed the other slayer.  I need to know what is
going on and how I can help them," replied Angel as he presented the
Oracles with a complete set of motivational lithographs.</p>

<p>"These are nice pictures,"</p>

<p>"Yes, nice indeed.  So you wish to know of the warlock Ciarán"</p>

<p> "He is a very dangerous foe, who seeks to make a even deadlier ally."</p>

<p>"He must be stopped before the ally can be brought through the
Hellmouth or the Outer Earth will be consumed in darkness as the wars
begin again."</p>

<p>"What is that suppose to mean," inquired Angel as he tried to
decipher what the oracles where saying. </p>

<p>"Go to the Ultimate Slayer and the Mage, they will know," replied the
first oracle.</p>

<p>"When you see them, you must tell them that the warlock has aligned
himself with the Demon Prince," replied the second.</p>

<p>Before Angel could ask the oracles anymore he found himself back in
his LA office.  He looked to Cordelia who was waiting for him, "It
looks like we are going to have to go to Sunnydale."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Giles and Joyce both awoke to find themselves bond and gagged in
chairs facing one another, in what appeared to be the main room of a
cabin.  </p>

<p>"I see your finally up Rupert," Replied Ethan as he walked over to
the couple, "tell me how does it feel to know you have lost."</p>

<p>Ethan let at out a loud chuckle, "I almost forgot, you are unable to
speak right now."</p>

<p>"Quite teasing my prisoners and prepare for the ceremony," demanded
Ciarán as he walked into the room carrying the book Fey had sent to
Giles.  The warlock then walked over to Giles and tossed the book in
his lap, "A very interesting book you have there, at least now I know
who it is that stands against me.  Now it is only a matter of getting
an ally to distract the void so I can grab the power of the
Hellmouth," replied  Ciarán as he pointed to a makeshift alter in the
far corner of the room, "The ceremony tonight should take care of
that, unfortunately when it is over I will no longer be in need of
your services."  </p>

<p>Ciarán removed the restraints from Giles and Joyce and motioned for
Ethan to take them to the cellar, "Enjoy yourself Rupert, for the two
of you do not have much time left on this earth."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Tara sat in the circle chanting as she reached out beyond the earth
Realms into the Ethereal.  </p>

<p>"What is wrong child?" inquired Fey</p>

<p>"It's the warlock, He injured the second slayer, and Kidnapped The
Watcher and the Ultimate Slayers mother."</p>

<p>"I was afraid something like this might happen.  How are the slayers
new powers?"</p>

<p>"She is still learning, she has already discovered her new physical
abilities but has yet to unleash the full potential of her mind."</p>

<p>"I see, what of the young mage?"</p>

<p>"She still hasn't discovered her nature, and relies heavily on spoken
magic."</p>

<p>Fey sighed, "This is not good, the warlock seeks an ally in the Demon
Prince if that happens we will need them both at their full
potential, other wise Outer Earth could be lost."</p>

<p>"What can I do to help," inquired Tara.</p>

<p>"I am going to go before the Powers that Be and ask for there help.
I need you to return to the slayer and the mage and prepare them for
the journey to the Upper Ethereal."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p> "How is she," asked Willow as she entered the room where Buffy was
tending to Faith.</p>

<p>"Not good, she's not healing like she should."</p>

<p>Willow walked over to Buffy and placed her hand on her lovers
shoulders, "What do you mean."</p>

<p>"I mean most of the smaller cuts and bruises should be gone by now
but they're not, for some reason her bodies not using her slayer
healing abilities."</p>

<p>Willow sat down on Buffy's lap and wrapped her arm around her, "Don't
worry we'll figure something out," she reassured her companion.</p>

<p>"Maybe I can help," replied Tara who had been silently waiting for
the two of them to finish talking.</p>

<p>Buffy looked at the blonde immortal and pondered if she wanted the
girls help.  She knew that Tara was there to help them but the girl
had dated Willow for a whole year when it should have been her and
she was finding that difficult to forgive.</p>

<p>Tara sensed Buffy's apprehension in wanting her help and knew that
she was to blame for it, "B-Buffy...I know that my actions in the
past have caused you pain but there is nothing I can do to change
that....I would only ask that you forgive me and realize that I mean
only to help the two of you."</p>

<p>Willow leaned over and kissed the slayer on the cheek, "It's OK
Sweetheart, you can trust her."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled at the redhead before turning her attention back to
Tara, "OK, Tell me what's  wrong with Faith."</p>

<p>"Her wounds are not healing the way they should because the damage is
magical in nature.  Unlike you, she is only a regular slayer, her
natural abilities are not enough to overcome the magic."</p>

<p>"Can the two of us heal her," inquired Willow.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I will do it.  You and Buffy have more pressing matters."</p>

<p>Both the girls looked at Tara in puzzlement, "What is that suppose to
mean," asked Buffy.</p>

<p>"Fey has gone to the Powers That Be on your behalf, if all goes well
you will be going to the upper Ethereal soon."</p>

<p>Willow's eyes grew real wide, "But that's the home of the.....Gods
and Goddesses."</p>

<p>"Yes....it is."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy and Willow felt their mind's cloud over for a moment, before
finding themselves standing side by side in a sacred grove.  Before
them stood an enchanting young woman with long flowing hair, she
seemed almost translucent to the two of them.  The woman floated
gracefully over next to them, "Fear not Warrior of Light, We mean no
harm to you or your soul mate."</p>

<p>"Who are you," inquired a very nervous slayer.</p>

<p>"I am called Brigid."</p>

<p>"Y-y-your the....G-goddess," stammered Willow.</p>

<p>The Goddess smiled at the two of them, "Yes I am, please join me over
by the brook we have much to talk about."</p>

<p>When the three of them reached the brook Buffy protectively wrapped
her arms around Willow, and demanded, "What do you want with us."</p>

<p>"Buffy try to be a little more polite, she's the Goddess," whispered
Willow.</p>

<p>The Goddess gently smiled at them and spoke in the most comforting
voice either one of them had ever heard, "It is all right young mage,
your lover means no malice or disrespect, it is the protective nature
of the warrior of light and her love for you that cause her actions
here."</p>

<p>The Goddess then stood directly in front of Buffy, "I come to you as
the head of the Powers that Be, to show you both your full potential,
it is the only way you will be able to fight the warlock and win."</p>

<p>Ciarán stood in jet black robes before the alter, "Achin Wer Zorin
Ta. Tursa God of Darkness I call upon thy name.   Xa Ner JI Zor.
Grant me an ally in my task so that I might serve thy cause.  Mala
Tore Vena."</p>

<p>A thick cloud of red smoke filled the room and a voice boomed from
it, "I am Laoise, Lord of Demons.  Why have you awakened me?"</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow walked hand in hand alongside the babbling brook as
the Goddess spoke, "Warrior of light tell me do you know how to use
your mind as a weapon."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure what you mean?"</p>

<p>"I feared you might answer in that manner.  You see child  the
increased strength and speed are only a portion of your abilities,
you have already used your mind as it was intended but did not
realize it."</p>

<p>Buffy stopped walking and stared at the Goddess, "Do you mean like
when I threw the vampires backwards without touching them?"</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I mean.  Your mind is unlike that of any other
slayer, when focused properly it can be just as deadly a weapon as
your fighting skills.  With it you will be able to manipulate the
energies that surround you.  Throwing vampires is just one of many
ways you can do this.  You have it in your ability now to use the
energies around you as a weapon.  They can be used just effectively
as a punch or a fist when fighting and if focused right be just as
deadly as a sword."</p>

<p>"I don't know how to do that, I'm not even sure how I threw those
vampires."</p>

<p>The Goddess moved swiftly over to Buffy and took the slayers chin in
her hand, "Look into my eyes and I will show you."</p>

<p>Willow rested her head on Buffy's shoulder as her lover stood in a
trance before the Goddess and waited for Buffy to come back to her.
After a few moments the slayer broke out of her trance, and tilted
her head towards Willow, "I'm back."</p>

<p>Willow took her head of Buffy's shoulder and softly kissed her on the
lips, "I see."</p>

<p>Buffy turned her attention away from Willow for a moment and looked
towards the Goddess, "I understand now, can we go now," inquired
Buffy who was wanting more than anything to finish the kiss Willow
had started in the privacy of their own room.</p>

<p>The Goddess smiled at the two young women, "I know that you wish to
be alone with your beloved Warrior of light, but there is still much
to accomplish."</p>

<p>The Goddess turned to Willow, "Tell me young mage, do you know what
it is that you are?"</p>

<p>Buffy wasn't sure if she liked where this conversation was going so
to be on the safe side she protectively wrapped her arms around
Willow, which caused the Goddess to chuckle, "Warrior of light I
assure you I mean no harm to your beloved."</p>

<p>Willow slightly blushed when she realized what had just taken place
and calmly reassured her soul mate, "It's OK Buffy, we are in the
presents of the Goddess, we're safe here."</p>

<p>Willow smiled at the slayer then turned to the Goddess, "I'm not sure
if I understand your question, I am pretty sure I know who I am, but
I don't know why everyone keeps calling me a mage, I am only a humble
Wicca."</p>

<p>"No child you are a mage, the immortal that Morgan le Fey sent form
the Middle Ethereal was helping you unlock your true magical nature,
however with the appearance of the warlock their is no longer time to
allow your abilities to develop naturally."</p>

<p>The goddess reached out her hand which was emanating a soft white
light and gently placed it on Willows forehead, "Young mage look to
your self and see what it is that you truly are."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Angel sat at Giles table with from Xander, Anya, and Tara, "Could you
please tell me again where Buffy and Willow are,: inquired the
brooding vamp wanting to make sure he heard the blonde girl correctly.</p>

<p>"They are with the Goddess learning the nature of their abilities and
how to use them," replied Tara.</p>

<p>Angel scratched his head, "Would you care to elaborate a little."</p>

<p>"You said when you first got her that the oracles told you to talk to
the ultimate slayer and the mage, am I correct."</p>

<p>"Yes, but what has that got to do with Buffy and Willow," asked a
frustrated Angel as Xander and Anya both nodded their heads in
agreement.</p>

<p>Tara grinned in amusement at the others, "It has everything to do
with them, they are the once you seek.  Buffy has found her soul mate
and become the ultimate slayer, the Warrior of light.  As for Willow
she is the mage that the oracles spoke of."</p>

<p>Tara took a deep breath before continuing, "The sudden appearance of
the warlock and the threat he posses to outer earth required that The
Powers That Be speed up things so they brought the two of them to the
upper Ethereal to teach of their powers."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"I am Laoise, Lord of Demons.  Why have you awakened me?"</p>

<p>"I am Ciarán, of the temple of Tursa.  I seek an alliance to enable
me to access the power of the Hellmouth."</p>

<p>"Why should I help you gain more power warlock, how would it benefit
me."</p>

<p>"Once I have tapped the power of the Hellmouth I will be able to open
it allowing you passage to outer earth, I only ask in return a
position of power in your regime once you have outer earth."</p>

<p>"What else will this alliance require of me warlock?"</p>

<p>"I need you to keep the mages and sentinels of the void occupied long
enough more me to gain access to the Hellmouth."</p>

<p>The red smoke engulfed Ciarán lifting him off the ground, "So shall
it be, Ciarán of the temple of Tursa you now are of my house, do not
fail to keep your end of the bargain, now go and do what you must to
prepare, I shall contact you when the time to strike is at hand."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Tara had just finished explaining the nature of the realms to the
group for the sixth time when Buffy and Willow appeared in the center
of the room.</p>

<p>Xander hopped up out of his seat, "Hey your back, come join the
party."</p>

<p>"Not now Xander, we have to get to the cabins on the edge of town
before all is lost," snapped Buffy.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"I don't have time to explain are you guys coming or not."</p>

<p>
Buffy and Willow cautiously made their way towards the towards the
front door of the cabin the Goddess had told them to go to as Angel,
Xander and Tara made their way towards the rear entrance of the cabin.</p>

<p>Ciarán smiled, unaware that they were being watched from outside, as
Ethan brought Giles and Joyce into the room in handcuffs.  He pulled
a dagger from his cloak and dropped it to the ground.  Then with a
wave of his hand it floated up in the air in front of him with the
blade pointed directly at Giles, "Farwell Rupert," replied Ciarán as
he sent the blade screaming though the air at the watcher.</p>

<p>Ciarán screamed out in anger as the blade stopped inches from his
victims heart before dropping to the ground.  He heard a feminine
voice from behind him speak, "Not today warlock."</p>

<p>Ciarán spun around just in time to be sent flying through the air by
Buffy's round house.  The warlock picked himself up off the ground,
and snarled, "I'll teach you to mess with me little girl."</p>

<p>"Don't you even think of hurting her," shouted Willow form the
doorway as she sent a bolt of energy through the air striking the
warlock in the chest.  </p>

<p>Ciarán looked at Buffy then Willow, "I don't know who you are or how
you did that but soon your going to regret the day that our paths
crossed."  He then folded his arms accrosed his chest, lowered his
head, and vanished into thin air.
Willow ran over next to Buffy, "I suggest you let them go."</p>

<p>Ethan quickly yanked a 9MM from his belt and pressed the barrel
against Giles for head, "So the other slayer and the witch have
decided to show themselves, well you might be good enough to stop a
dagger but I seriously doubt either one of you could stop a bullet
from killing your watcher in time. Now back off."</p>

<p>Suddenly Ethan's hand was grabbed from behind with such force that
every finger bone in it was crushed causing him to drop the loaded
weapon to the ground, "I'm not going to let that happen," replied
Angel.</p>

<p>Giles leaned back on the couch with a cup of tea in one hand and the
other wrapped around Joyce. He smiled as he looked around the room at
his extended family, "I want to thank all of you for coming to our
aid."</p>

<p>"You don't have to, after all you would have done the same for any of
us," Replied Buffy.</p>

<p>"Yes I do, it was a considerable risk you took by storming in on
Ciarán.  You saved our lives and I'll be forever in your debt for
that."</p>

<p>"Well in that case, your welcome," Buffy cheerfully replied as she
embraced Willow and pulled the red head close to her.</p>

<p>"Uh, I hate to ruin the moment, but speaking of Ciarán, does any one
have an idea of what happened to him," inquired Angel.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure, but I think he teleported himself out of the cabin."
replied Willow.</p>

<p>"Then he could be anywhere?"</p>

<p>Giles felt the sudden urge to hold on to Joyce and not let go.  He
sat down his tea and pulled her tightly up against him, "I'm afraid
that appears to be the case."</p>

<p>The mood in the room quickly changed from joy that Giles and Joyce
where safe, to a very somber tone, as they considered the
implications of the warlocks escape. Ciarán was out there and nobody
was safe.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"Where am I," inquired a groggy Faith?</p>

<p>"Your at Giles," answered Tara.</p>

<p>"Giles...the warlock, he's got him and B's mom, we've got to save
them," cried Faith as she tried to force herself out of bed.</p>

<p>Tara got up from the chair she had been sitting in ever since casting
the healing spell on the brunette slayer and walked over to the bed.
She put her hand on Faiths shoulder, "Buffy and Willow rescued them,
they're here, safe and sound."</p>

<p>"Oh...maybe I should go see them then."</p>

<p>"That can wait till tomorrow, you need to rest some more so the magic
can heal you."</p>

<p>Faith laid back down in the bed and sighed, she was glad that Giles
and Joyce were safe but wished that she would have been able to help
Buffy with the rescue.  After all, that's the way it had always been
since she came to Sunnydale, her and B versus whatever big nasty
decided to show itself. But, now that Buffy had finally hooked up
with Red maybe she didn't need her help anymore. Faith found herself
feeling very much alone in the world.</p>

<p>Tara sat on the edge of the bed and watched the brunettes face fill
with depression, she reached out and softly placed her hand on the
girls arm, "A penny for your thoughts."</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"Nothings wrong, I'm five by five."</p>

<p>"N-no you're not...it's written all over your face."</p>

<p>Faith laid there a few moments watching the blonde immortal before
finally speaking, "I don't think B needs my help any more."</p>

<p>"Why would you think that."</p>

<p>"Because she has Willow now, plus she seems to be some kind of super
slayer, why would she possibly need my help."</p>

<p>"Because not only are you a fellow slayer but your her friend,
besides I have a bad feeling that her and Willow are going to need
all the help they can get before this is over."</p>

<p>"It doesn't feel like that."</p>

<p>"Give it time," Tara stood up to leave, "I've g-got to go now, get
some rest."</p>

<p>"Tara?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Could you stay, I don't want to be alone."</p>

<p>"I-if you....W-want."</p>

<p>"I want."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Giles leaned up against the headboard with Joyce lying up by his
side, her head resting on his chest as he quietly played with her
silky hair. Just a half hour ago he had returned from the basement
after questioning Ethan and what he had learned terrified him.  Not
only had Ciarán made an ally, but it was the Demon Prince, Laoise.
Everything he had ever read about this powerful lord of darkness was
extremely bad.  He was referred to as the Destroyer of Worlds and
the  Bringer of Doom. Wherever he walked, death followed.  Giles
leaned over and kissed Joyce on the forehead as she slept, <We have
got to put an end to this alliance before  Laoise can come, but how?></p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy passionately embraced Willow and smothered the red head with
sweet tender kisses, "God Wills, I love you so much."</p>

<p>"I love you to Buffy," Moaned Willow as she wrapped her arms around
the slayer and began slowly running her left hand down the blondes
back.</p>

<p>Buffy gently tightened her grip on Willow and lifted her off the
ground.  </p>

<p>"Uh, Buffy what are you doing?"</p>

<p>The slayer moved swiftly towards Willows bed, she sat down pulling
Willow into her lap, "This," replied the blonde before pressing her
lips against Willow's.</p>

<p>The kiss seemed to last forever and neither one of them wanted it to
end, only the need for air forced them to break it."</p>

<p>"Huh, uh, t-that was amazing," gasped Willow.</p>

<p>"It certainly was," exclaimed Buffy as she laid back on the bed
pulling Willow down on top of her, "Let's do it again."</p>

<p>"OK," replied Willow as she brought her lips to the slayers.</p>

<p>Their bodies became entwined as they continued to fervently kiss one
another. The concerns and problems of the world where lost to them in
the passion of their love.  The fact that a powerful warlock was
roaming the streets of the Hellmouth didn't matter, in that moment
there was only the two of them and it was bliss.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>The Middle Ethereal:</p>

<p>Alexandria walked across the Hall of the Slayers to Fey, "Where they
in time?"</p>

<p>"Yes and no, The watcher and The Warrior of Light's mother where
saved but the warlock was able to make an alliance with the Demon
Prince, Laoise."</p>

<p>"What do we do now?"</p>

<p>"Contact the void and let them now what has happened, besides that,
there is nothing to do but watch and wait."</p>

<p>"And when the warlock makes his move?"</p>

<p>"We hope The Warrior of Light and The Mage can stop him."</p>

<p>"And if they can't, and the Demon Prince comes?"</p>

<p>"Then the Realm wars begin once again."</p>
