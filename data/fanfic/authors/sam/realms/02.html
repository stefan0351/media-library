<p>Faith opened her eyes as the first rays of light flickered through
her bedroom window, she started to get out of bed when she realized
she wasn't alone, turning her head to her right she looked at the
blonde immortal that was peacefully sleeping by her side and smiled.  </p>

<p>Faith gently tugged on Tara's shoulder, "Time to get up."</p>

<p>"Uh huh, where am I?"</p>

<p>"Your at Giles place."</p>

<p>Tara sat up in bed and gazed into the brunette slayers eyes, "Oh,
Uh...Good M-morining"</p>

<p>Faith grinned at the blonde and grabbed her by the hand, "It
certainly is."</p>

<p>Tara felt here heart began to race as Faith held her hand, "D-do we
need to talk"</p>

<p>"Probably"</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Willow felt her lovers soft lips press against her forehead, "Morning"</p>

<p>"Morning," replied Buffy just before tenderly kissing Willow's lips.</p>

<p>"Hmm, I think I could wake up this way for the rest of my life."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled at her beloved, "I think I can arrange that."</p>

<p>The slayer then deeply kissed Willow, "I love you, I have always
loved you, and I always will love you."</p>

<p>Willow gave her a mischievous grin, "I love you too, now how about
another kiss."</p>

<p>"Your wish is my command," replied Buffy. </p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>"Tara, about last night."</p>

<p>"Y-yes."</p>

<p>"I...I really don't know where to start so I'm just going to shoot
from the hip.  First thanks for fixing me up, and second thanks for
staying with me."</p>

<p>"Y-your welcome," replied Tara with a tear in her eye.</p>

<p>Faith reached over and carefully wiped it away, "There's a third
part, you know."</p>

<p>"There is?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, there is.  I'm not sure what is happening between us but it
feels right and I want to give it a chance.  Do you?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes."</p>

<p>"Good, I was kinda hoping you'd say that."</p>

<p>Tara nervously fiddled with her hair as Faith slid up against
her, "UH....W-what...."</p>

<p>"Shhh," replied Faith as she placed her finger against the blondes
lips, "I sorta want to try something."</p>

<p> "W-what"</p>

<p>"This," replied Faith placing her forehead against Tara's. </p>

<p>The two young women stayed like that for a moment listening to one
anothers rapid breathing, afraid to go any further.  Faith then moved
in even closer to Tara, she affectionately gave the blonde a quick
kiss then pulled back to gauge the other girls reaction</p>

<p>"That was..."</p>

<p>"Amazing" </p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Giles immediately walked over as soon as Buffy and Willow walked into
his house,  "I need to talk to the two of you in private."</p>

<p>As soon as the three of them got into the kitchen Buffy stared at
Giles, her face filled with deep concern as she held protectively on
to Willow, "OK, what's the bad news?"</p>

<p>Giles smiled at the slayer, "Buffy, what makes you think there is bad
news?"</p>

<p>"Well it might be the fact that there is a Warlock in town and that
he has made some kinda of alliance with a demon prince."</p>

<p>"Point taken, but I assure you what I have to say is not bad at all."</p>

<p>"That's good," responded Buffy as she loosened her grip on
Willow, "So what`s up?"</p>

<p>"I have always though of you as a daughter and was wondering about
how you would feel if I was to be your step dad."</p>

<p>"You guys are getting married," exclaimed a very excited
slayer, "When did you pop the question?" </p>

<p>"I haven't, I wanted to talk to you first."</p>

<p>Buffy grinned from ear to ear as she looked at her watcher, "You're
asking my permission aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, so what do you think."</p>

<p>"Giles except for Willow, you and my Mom are the most important
people in my life  I say go for it but only if me and Willow get to
be brides maids."</p>

<p>Giles smiled in relief, "Deal."</p>

<p>"So when you going to ask," replied Willow?</p>

<p>"Yeah good question, when?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking about this evening."</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow took there seats side by side at the table and
looked around at the others, stopping when they came to where Faith
and Tara where seated.  Both of them noticed how the brunette slayer
and the blonde immortal where sitting rather closely to one another.
A though came accrosed Buffy's mind so she pretended to accidentally
knock Willow's backpack off the table so she could pick it up.</p>

<p>Once down below the table she quickly looked accrosed to where her
fellow slayer was seated and confirmed her suspicions, the two of
them where holding hands.  </p>

<p>She placed the backpack on the table and leaned over and whispered in
her girlfriends ear, which resulted in Willow giving Tara and Faith a
quick look before turning to Buffy and shrugging.  </p>

<p>Buffy smiled at Willow and then gave the two girls a quick glance
before turning her attention to Giles, who was going over what they
knew about Ciarán and the Demon Prince. </p>

<p>&lt;I think me and Willow need to have a talk with Faith tonight on
patrol.&gt;</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Ciarán ran his hand accrosed the his dagger, he had hoped to kill
Rupert and the dark haired woman with it but the blonde and the red
head had managed to prevent that, not that it mattered.  Sure they
where more powerful than he expected the watcher's allies to be, but
it didn't concern him.  He wasn't even bothered by Ethan's capture,
after all his old apprentice was only a pawn.  Now that he was
aligned with the Demon Prince they all would soon be dead and he
would be the most powerful warlock in all the realms.  </p>

<p>&lt;Enjoy yourselves while you can for soon there will be no stopping me&gt;</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>"You call for me My Lord?" inquired the Gray Demon.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have a special task for you," replied Prince Laoise.</p>

<p>"What is it My Lord?"</p>

<p>"I have made an alliance that will soon allow my minions access to
Outer Earth, but a lot has changed since the Realm War.  I wish for
you to travel through the void and go to Outer Earth, meet with the
warlock Ciarán, and prepare for my arrival."</p>

<p>"How am I to get past the Sentinels My Lord?"</p>

<p>"I will send a strike force at the void to distract them long enough
for you to make your way through."</p>

<p>"Yes My Lord."</p>

<p>Laoise stood up from his throne, "One more thing, once you have made
contact with the warlock I wish for you to gather The Children of
Darkness that dwell on Outer Earth.  There where no slayers when my
armies last stormed Outer Earth and I don`t want any this time.  Find
the slayers and their allies and kill them"</p>

<p>"With pleasure my lord."</p>

<p>Giles basked in Joyce's beauty as the tunes of Barry White played
softly in the background.  He noted how radiant she was in the
flickering candle light, and how it caused his pulse to quicken.
Taking a deep breath He got of from his chair and walked around the
dinner table, He got down on one knee and tenderly took Joyce's hand
in his, "Joyce, I love you more than anything, I can't imagine my
life without by my side.  Will you marry me?"</p>

<p>Joyce's heart beat rapidly, and tears began to from in her eyes. She
slid out of her chair, wrapped her arms around Giles, and kissed him
lightly on the cheek, "Yes, Rupert, Yes."</p>

<p>Giles folded his arms around his new fiancé and pulled her up against
him, "Joyce you just made me the happiest man on the earth," wept
Giles as he tenderly kissed Joyce's lips.</p>

<p>Giles pulled the diamond engagement ring from his lets pocket and
slid it on to Joyce's finger. Tears of pure joy flowed down her
cheeks as she gazed at the rig, "And you've made me the happiest
woman on the earth," sobbed Joyce as she rested her head on Giles
shoulder. </p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>"Faith, can we talk," inquired Buffy as they made their way through
the cemetery.</p>

<p>"Sure B.  Whatta won't to talk about."</p>

<p>Buffy stopped, took Willow by the hand, and stared directly at her
fellow slayer, "You and Tara."</p>

<p>Faith saw the determination in both Buffy and Willows face and
sighed, "There's nothing to talk about."</p>

<p>"I think there is, so spill."</p>

<p>Faith looked at Buffy and Willow and shook her head, "Great, double
resolve face, when'd Red teach ya that B."</p>

<p>"Faith, you're stalling."</p>

<p>"We kissed."</p>

<p>"And held hands," added Buffy.</p>

<p>"You saw that B."</p>

<p>"We both did," replied Willow.</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"So what's the deal," inquired Buffy.</p>

<p>"I just told you, we kissed and....."</p>

<p>"And, what?"</p>

<p>"I liked it, I like her, now can we please talk about something else."</p>

<p>Buffy noticed the frustration that was in Faiths voice, "No we can't,
you obviously got feelings for her and from what we saw she seems to
have feelings for you.  Faith you should be happy, but your not.
What`s wrong?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure if she feels the same way?"</p>

<p>"Go on"</p>

<p>"The kiss, it was amazing and when we held hands I felt like I have
never felt with anyone one else ever before."</p>

<p>Buffy cocked her head towards Faith, "Anyone?"</p>

<p>"Anyone, I could feel the chemistry working between us," Faith hung
her head down before continuing. "But at the same time I could feel
tension  I know she felt the same way about the kiss, but I think she
regrets it.  I don`t know what to do B."</p>

<p>"Have you talked to Tara about it?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't know what to say."</p>

<p>Willow smiled at Faith, "Would you like me to talk to her about it?"</p>

<p>"You'd do that for me Red?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I would."</p>

<p>Buffy then walked up to Faith and comfortably put her hand on the
brunette slayer shoulder, "Faith, I got just one thing to say to you."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Take it slow."</p>

<p>"Buffy's right.  Tara's shy, plus she's probably still trying to deal
with the whole break up thing.  So for now be there for her, and take
it slow. OK?"</p>

<p>"OK."</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Tara wiped  the tears from her face as she answered the door, "Uh,
Willow...Is e-everything OK?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'm here to find out. Can I come in?"</p>

<p>"Sure," answered Tara motioning for Willow to enter.</p>

<p>"Uh, what did you want," nervously replied Tara.</p>

<p> "I need to talk to you about Faith."</p>

<p>"I'm s-sorry.....I shouldn't have let it happen, c-can you forgive
me," sobbed Tara as the guilt of kissing Faith overwhelmed her.</p>

<p>"Tara, what do you have to be sorry about?"</p>

<p>"The k-kiss, I d-didn't mean to betray you, it just....h-happened."</p>

<p>Willow placed her hand on Tara's shoulder, "Tara I know that the last
few weeks have been really hard on you so please don't take this the
wrong way, but how could kissing Faith betray me?"</p>

<p>Tara hung her head down so she wouldn't have to look Willow in the
eyes, "I k-know that your with.....B-buffy now, where you b-belong b-
but...I still f-feel g-guilty, I can't h-help it...a big part of me
still..
l-loves you"</p>

<p>"Tara, look at me.  What we had was very special, and while I still
care for you it's as a close friend.  I really hope that we can be
friends. Can we?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes."</p>

<p>"Good, I'm glad to hear that.  As for Faith, you have nothing to feel
guilty about, unless you're leading her own.  Do you like her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but.."</p>

<p>"But nothing Tara.  You need to move on, moping around like this is
unhealthy, take my word for it, I've went down that road with Oz and
I don't want to see you go through that.  I think you should give
Faith a chance, you two could be good for one another."</p>

<p>"I don't know if I'm ready," sobbed Tara.</p>

<p>"Then take it slow."</p>

<p>"I don't know where to start."</p>

<p>Willow got up and walked over to the door, "Talking to her would be a
good place," replied Willow as she opened the door and Buffy
practically pushed Faith into Tara's room.</p>

<p>Willow smiled at Tara and Faith as she stepped out into the hallway
with Buffy, "Remember take it slow." </p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>The two girls stood there staring at one another, each fearing that
they would choose the wrong words and ruin any chance of a
relationship with the other.</p>

<p>Faith gathered all of her inner strength and carefully moved over to
Tara, "Do you like me?"</p>

<p>"Yes"</p>

<p>"Good, because I like you," Faith paused for a moment as she
carefully though out her next words, "I know that I could never
replace Willow, but I would like to give us a try."</p>

<p>Tara could see the brunette slayers hands nervously trembling as she
waited for her to respond. She reached out and took Faith by the
hands, "S-so would I."</p>

<p>"What's your favorite color?"</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"I want to do this right, so I kinda figured we should sorta get to
know each other first."</p>

<p>"Oh....Blue, how about you?"</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>"So do you think it will work," Asked Buffy as she sat down on her
and Willow's bed?</p>

<p>"I think it has potential, if it works or not is up to them," Replied
Willow.</p>

<p>"Well I hope it works, Tara would be good for Faith, plus I wouldn't
have to worry about her trying to win your heart back."</p>

<p>Willow walked over to the bed and slid onto Buffy's lap, "How many
times do I have to tell you that you don't have to worry about that?
My heart belongs to you and you alone and nothing will ever change
that."</p>

<p>Buffy wrapped her arms around Willows waste and began planting soft
kisses on the back of the red heads neck causing Willow to let out a
low moan.  "I take it you like," Buffy said cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I like," murmured Willow as she leaned back into her soul mate.</p>

<p>Buffy continued to tenderly kiss Willow's neck as she pulled her love
back into the bed with her.  She slid out from beneath the red head
and positioned herself so she could look into Willow's enchanting
green eyes, "Your my world Willow, my reason for living, without you
I don`t think I could make it"</p>

<p>A tear rolled down Willow's cheek, "Buffy, that has got to be the
sweetest thing anyone has ever said to me."</p>

<p>Buffy leaned into Willow and embraced her, "There's more, I love you
so much, when you where with Tara I felt my heart break everyday, I
was alone, lost in my heartache  But now that we are together I feel
like the weight of the world has been lifted off of my shoulders.
You make me complete Willow."</p>

<p>Willow ran her hand accrosed Buffy's face and gently wiped away her
lovers tears, "I love you," replied Willow as she reached over to the
night stand and turned out the light.</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>"Warlock, we have much to discuss," replied the grey demon as he
walked into the warehouse where Ciarán had moved his operation to.</p>

<p>Ciarán's hand began to emitted a bright red glow as he pointed
towards the demon, "Who are you, and why have you invaded my
sanctuary," hissed the warlock.</p>

<p>"I am Torin, The Assassin.  I was sent by Laoise, Prince of Demons to
prepare for his arrival." </p>

<p>Ciarán lowered his hand and moved over towards the grey demon, "You
say you are an assassin?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is my duty to eliminate those who would oppose My Lord."</p>

<p> "I see,  do you have any one in particular in mind?"</p>

<p>"My Lord wished the Slayers and their allies dead."</p>

<p>A sinister smile came accrosed Ciarán's face, "I see we have similar
goals, tell me Torin do you have anything in particular in mind." </p>

<p>"Yes, but first we must gather the Children of the Night, I need to
gauge our enemies strength before we make our move."</p>

<p>"WOW, it's beautiful Mom," exclaimed Buffy as Joyce
showed off her
engagement ring to the group.</p>

<p>"Yeah, it's great, so when's the date?" Inquired Willow.</p>

<p>"We`re thinking April, May time frame," replied Giles as
he pulled
his fiancé into a hug.</p>

<p>"Way to go G, who would have trunk you had it in you,"
Blurted Faith
as she slapped the watcher on the back.</p>

<p>Tara walked up next to Faith and took her hand, blushing slightly at
the brunette slayers actions, "Congratulations Mr. Giles, Mrs.
Summers."</p>

<p>"Yeah congratulations G-man, you to Mrs. Summers," replied
Xander.</p>

<p>"Ditto," replied Anya.</p>

<p>Giles smiled as he though of his good fortune, not only did he have
wonderful friends but soon he would be marring the love of his
life, "Thanks."  </p>

<p>A mischievous grin came across Buffy's face, and she cocked her
head
towards Giles, "So I just have one question for you Giles, seeing
that you're going to be my step dad and all, I was wondering when
the
allowance kicks in."</p>

<p>"Buffy," exclaimed Joyce and Willow in unison as everyone
else in the
room started laughing.</p>

<p>"Hey a slayers got to try," she replied joining her friends
in
laughing.</p>

<p>Later that Evening.......</p>

<p>"So Faith, how did it go?" inquired Willow.</p>

<p>"How'd what go Red?" teased Faith.</p>

<p>"You know what she wants to know," replied Buffy, draping her
arm
around Willows shoulders as they continued on their nightly patrol.</p>

<p>"It went good.  I think we really hit it off."</p>

<p>"You think," pushed Willow.</p>

<p>"OK, you got me it went great, we spent half the night getting to
know each other  We talked about everything, our likes, dislikes,
hopes, you know all that kinda stuff."</p>

<p>"How about the other half of the night," jested Buffy.</p>

<p>Willow didn't know what surprised her more, the fact that her
girlfriend had actually asked that question or the fact that Faith
seemed to be blushing, "Buffy, aren't you being a little bit
nosy."</p>

<p>"And aren't you a little bit curious yourself," responded
the blonde
slayer.</p>

<p>"It's OK Red," replied a flustered Faith, "Nothing
else really
happened.  We held hands for a while then fell asleep.  We're
taking
your guys advise and taking it slow."</p>

<p>"Good." replied Buffy and Willow in unison.</p>

<p>Before anyone could say another word on the subject Buffy stopped
walking and motioned towards the nearby tree line, "I think we
have
company," she replied, as a dozen vampires slowly began to emerge
from the trees.</p>

<p>Faith took up a fighting stance as Buffy stepped forward placing
herself between the approaching vampires and Willow, "Stay behind
me
Wills."</p>

<p>"What do we have here,"  Replied one of the vamps.</p>

<p>"Looks like slayer number one, her little witch, and slayer
number
two," answered another vamp.</p>

<p>Buffy focused on the space just in front of her just like the Goddess
had shown her and it began to ripple, she then pushed forward at it
with her hand sending the a compressed pocket of air at one of the
vampires like it was a stake, reducing him to dust</p>

<p>Buffy and Faith sprung into action as the remaining vamps began to
charge.  Willow  threw her left hand up and a fire ball three feet in
diameter appeared above her head, she pointed towards the oncoming
vampires with her right hand, sending the ball careening into the
vampire closest to Buffy.  After the vampire had burst into flames
and turned to dust Willow reached out with her mind to Buffy and
formed a protective shield around her , once she was sure that her
lover was safe she reached out with her mind to Faith and did the
same for the brunette slayer.</p>

<p>Buffy grabbed a vampire by the shirt and flung him into a near by
tree then quickly connected a series of powerful jabs knocking
another one to the ground.  A third vamp toke a swing at her but she
was to quick for him and easily dodged the blow.  She kicked the vamp
in the groin sending him to his knees, producing Mr. pointy she
finished him off.  The blonde slayer then made a hand motion towards
one of the trees and the air around one of the larger branched seemed
to waver, suddenly the branch snapped of the tree, sailed through the
air, and staked a vampire who was trying to get past her.  </p>

<p>While she was doing this two vampires hand managed to move around in
behind her, they both leapt at the slayers back at the same time only
to be thrown to the ground by the protective field Willow had thrown
up around Buffy. </p>

<p>Faith had just staked one vampire and was exchanging punches with
another.    She wasn't sure what was happening in the fight but
knew
Willow was somehow behind it  Not only did none of the vamps punches
seem to harm her but every time he would connect the vamp would
cringe and stumble back a few steps.  She watched as the vamp fell
back once again from trying to attacker her, but this time he
awkwardly tripped over his own feet and fell to the ground.  Faith
was quickly upon him with her stake in hand.</p>

<p>Willow saw the remaining vampires start to run away, she waved her
hand in the air and creating a crystal clear ball, that appeared to
have a mini lighting storm going on inside it, over the area the
vamps where running towards.  Her eyes began to glow a bright green
as bolts of energy shot from the ball and vaporized the remaining
vampires upon impact.</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Torin moved from the shadows where he had concealed himself and
watched as the three young women headed off into the night.  He was
confidant that the brunette slayer would be easy to deal with however
the red headed mage and the blonde troubled him.  From what he saw he
knew that the mage was indeed powerful and the blonde who he had
first mistaken for another slayer was a mystery.  Not only did she
appear stronger and faster that any mortal including a slayer should
be, but she somehow was able to manipulate the space around her and
use it as a weapon.  He thought for a moment and shuttered as he
recalled one of the ancient legends, could it be, could a Warrior of
Light have been called and his master was unaware of it.  Torin then
smiled, this was going to be harder than he though, but with
Ciarán's
help he would destroy all of them and their friends. </p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Willow carefully looked over every inch of Buffy's body looking
for
even the slightest scratch that tonight's battle might had caused.
The slayer almost chuckled at her soul mates actions, "Wills,
I'm
fine.  I don't even have a paper cut thanks to that force field
of
yours."</p>

<p>"You sure?"</p>

<p>"Positive," replied Buffy patting the mattress, "care to
join me?"</p>

<p>"That would be nice," answered Willow as she sat down not on
the bed
where Buffy had indicated but in the slayers lap.</p>

<p>"Feeling a little bit frisky tonight, huh?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," blushed Willow.
Buffy wrapped her hands around Willows waste and tenderly kissed her
neck, "I could do this all night."</p>

<p>"You could?"</p>

<p>"Yeah but I won't."</p>

<p>"Oh," sighed Willow who was enjoying her lovers treatment.</p>

<p>"Not that I don't want to but I have other plans for
you," huskly
spoke the slayer.  Using her rapid speed Buffy stood and spun around
with Willow in her arms and carefully placed the red head underneath
her on the bed.  She then deeply kissed Willow's lips.  </p>

<p>Willow's breathing was rhythmic as she tried to catch her breath
from
Buffy's passionate kiss.  She looked into the gentle blue eyes of
her
slayer, "Oh!"</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Faith was almost to Tara's dorm when a voice stopped her dead in
her
tracts, "Going somewhere slayer?"</p>

<p>She spun around to face the person who had spoken, suddenly she found
herself wishing that Buffy and Willow where with her, her hands began
to tremble as she watched the warlock make his way over to her.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid of me, I mean you no harm, your not worth
the
effort," cruelly replied the slayer.</p>

<p>"W-what...do you want?"</p>

<p>"Nothing really, I was only wondering what it felt like to be the
second fiddle."</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"You know what's it feel like to be nothing more than a side
kick to
the Blonde, though I don`t think you will manage to maintain that
status much longer now that she has her little mage."</p>

<p>Ciarán smiled as depression filled the brunettes face, and her
lips
started to quiver, "What use could the two of them possibly have
for
the likes of you, a sub power slayer who really doesn't
understand
the order of things."</p>

<p>"I...I..."</p>

<p>"Look at you, you can barely speak, what possible help could you
be
to them, if anything your a hindrance. They have to take time to make
sure you are properly protected in battle and eventually it will cost
one or both of them their lives, you should leave before they realize
how much of a waste you are.  Ah but you won`t, mainly because of
your girlfriend."</p>

<p>"How did you...."</p>

<p>Ciarán cut Faith off in mid-sentence, "How did I know, child I
know
many things.  How long do you think she will stay with you once she
figures out how pathetic you truly are.  Spare yourself the
heartbreak and leave while you still can."</p>

<p>Ciarán's sinister laughter filled the night sky as he watched
the
brunette run off towards the dorms openly sobbing. </p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>"Warlock, is it done," inquired Torin.</p>

<p>"Yes, With any luck the slayer will soon be on the run."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"She was devastated, if were lucky she might even do the job for
us,"
laughed the warlock.</p>

<p>"Good, now we must draw are attention to the Warrior of Light and
the
Mage."</p>

<p>"They are a powerful foe, how do you intend to deal with
them."</p>

<p>"With this," replied the Gray Demon, picking up a blowgun and
dart
from the table, "A little distraction and one shot is all I need
to
do the job"</p>

<p>"You plan on killing both of them with one dart?"</p>

<p>"No only the Warrior of Light."</p>

<p>"What about the Mage."</p>

<p>"If the legends I have read are true she will fade away rather
quickly after the Warrior of Light is gone, and then the way will be
ready for My Lord."</p>

<p>Faith stood out side Tara's room crying, she wanted to knock on the
door, to hold the blonde in her arms, and tell her every cruel word
the warlock had spoken, but she couldn't.  Instead she found herself
staring at the door, afraid to go inside, what if he was right, what
if she was nothing but a feeble attempt by Tara to replace Red. Maybe
they all would be better off without her.  Faith tuned away from the
door, hung her head low, and began to walk away.</p>

<p>"D-don't you want to see me?"</p>

<p>Faith stopped when she heard Tara's question, slowly she turned
around and looked up at the blonde who was now standing out in the
hallway.</p>

<p>Tara felt as if her heart was going to break when she saw the anguish
that filled the brunette slayers eyes.  She walked over to Faith and
placed her hands on the girls shoulders, "What's wrong."</p>

<p>Faith looked at Tara through tear stained eyes, and managed to get
out the one word that said it all, "Warlock."</p>

<p>Tara's mind filled with fear as she recalled the damage the Warlock
had done to the brunette slayer, she took Faith gently by the arm and
led the slayer into her room.  Once inside she shut the door and
began examining Faith for whatever type of injury that the vial
warlock might had caused her.</p>

<p>A smile crept onto Faith's face as the blonde carefully ran her hands
over her body,  "Uh, Tara not that I mind the attention or anything
but what are you doing?" huskily replied the brunette slayer.</p>

<p>"I-I'm checking to see if you're injured."</p>

<p>The tears once again began to roll down Faiths face, her voice filled
with despair as she struggled to get the words out, "I'm not, he
didn't even try to attack, guess I'm not worth the effort."</p>

<p>"Why would you even think something like that?"</p>

<p>"It's true, even before Buffy was transformed into this all powerful
super slayer I was second rate compared to her and now I'm nothing
but a hindrance. They're better off without me, you're better off
with out me," sobbed Faith.</p>

<p>Tara wrapped her arms around Faith and pulled the brunette up against
her, "I don't know what the warlock did to you but whatever he said
isn't true. It doesn't matter that Buffy has become a warrior of
light or that Willow is a mage, they still need your help more than
you realize.  And the part about me being better off without you, I
don't know how you got that in your head but it's not true.  I need
you Faith."</p>

<p>"Why could you possibly need me?" wept Faith.</p>

<p>"B-because I l-love you."</p>

<p>"You do?"</p>

<p>Tara leaned into Faith until their lips where less than an inch
apart, "I do," she softly replied before closing the rest of the
distance and kissing the brunette slayer.</p>

<p>Tara gently pulled away from Faith and led her over to the bed, "Sit."</p>

<p>Faith sat down, and took a deep breath as Tara sat down beside her.
She turned to the blonde, "W-what are we doing?" nervously inquired
Faith.</p>

<p>"We're going to talk about what happened tonight with the Warlock."</p>

<p>Tara could feel the anger mounting inside her as she listened to the
warlocks venomous words, and for the first time in her life she felt
the urge to use her powers to destroy someone.</p>

<p>Tara rested her head on Faith's shoulder, and began to softly speak
to her, "Everything he told you, was nothing more than lies meant to
hurt you.  You're a very special person, and your friends need you
more than you realize. That's why the warlock did what he did.  He
knows how important you are to everyone and hoped that if he got you
out of the picture everything would fall apart."</p>

<p>Faith tenderly kissed Tara on the cheek, "I don't know what I did to
deserve you coming into my life, but I do know that I love you."</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Willow leaned up against Buffy as the two of them listened to Tara
tell them what the warlock had said to Faith and reassured the
brunette slayer that this was nothing but viscous lies.</p>

<p>Buffy looked over at Faith and smiled at her fellow slayer, "You know
Tara's right, you're very important to all of us."</p>

<p>"But the two of you have become so powerful, what could.  ."</p>

<p>Buffy jumped back into to the conversation cutting off Faith in mid
sentence, "Listen to me, it doesn't matter if I'm a warrior of light,
a slayer, or a pompom girl, your still going to be my friend, and I
need that more than anything.  Besides rumor has it that you're a
pretty good slayer."</p>

<p>"She's right Faith, we both need you to be there, to support us, and
to help us fight all the bad nastiness that are out there.  Just like
you always have," replied Willow.</p>

<p>"You mean it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Buffy and Willow in unison.</p>

<p>"B, Red . . .Thanks."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it that's what friends are for.  How about if we get
this patrol over with so we can figure out how to kick the warlocks
butt back to whatever rock he crawled out from under," replied Buffy.</p>

<p>"Sounds good to me B."</p>

<p align=center>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>The Grey Demon clenched his fist as he stepped out from the tree line
and watched the four young women walk away from the college campus.
He tuned and glared at Ciarán then slammed his power fist into a
nearby tree.  "You failed," snarled Torin.</p>

<p>"I did as you asked, it's not my fault that the slayer didn't leave
or come running to us."</p>

<p>"Do you know who you are speaking to?" growled Torin.</p>

<p>"Yes I do, and assassin demon or not it was your plan that failed.
It was your plan that brought them all closer together instead of
pulling them apart.  If you're so afraid of the Warrior of Lights
friend being able to stop your attempt on her life then I suggest
that you let me deal with them."</p>

<p>"And what would you do?"</p>

<p>"I would annihilate them."</p>

<p>"That would alert her and the Mage to our plans," snapped Torin.</p>

<p>"Yes, but their allies and families would be dead and they would be
alone."</p>

<p>"They make a good couple," stated Angel.</p>

<p>"Yeah, all right, but which couple are you talking about," Inquired
Cordelia pointing towards the two slayers and their girlfriends
walked from the dance floor towards the table.</p>

<p>Xander leaned back in his seat and wrapped an arm around Anya, "She's
got a good point, do you mean Buffy and Willow or Tara and Faith?"</p>

<p>"I was talking about Buffy and Willow, but Faith and Tara are good
for one another too."</p>

<p>"Nice of ya to approve of us oh brooding one," replied Faith as she
and Tara sat down across from Angel.</p>

<p>Tara gave Faith a playful punch on the shoulder, "That's not nice."</p>

<p>"Well when he starts to cheer up and isn't Mr. Doom and Gloom all the
time I'll stop," replied Faith.</p>

<p>"Good point, Faith," replied Buffy as her and Willow took their seats.</p>

<p>The next few hours seemed to fly by for the group as they talked
about old times, joked with one another, filled Cordelia and Angel in
on what had happened in Sunnydale since the two of them had left for
LA, and listened to the brooding vampire and ex-cheerleader tell of
their LA adventures.</p>

<p>Buffy stood up and took Willows hand, "Care for one last dance before
we head out on patrol?"</p>

<p>"Definitely," replied Willow.</p>

<p>Faith leaned over to Tara, "What ya say we join em?"</p>

<p>Before Tara could respond a mysterious cold breeze blew through the
bronze, sending Buffy and Faiths slayer senses into over drive.</p>

<p>Tara wrapped her arms around the brunette slayer who had began
trembling, "Faith, what's wrong?"</p>

<p>"He's here." </p>

<p>"Who's here?"</p>

<p>"The Warlock," replied Faith recalling the coldness she had felt
during the other two encounters with the warlock.</p>

<p>"If he's here he's not alone," shouted Buffy as several vampires made
their way into the bronze.</p>

<p>The two slayers and Angel took up fighting positions in front of the
others as the vampires slowly began to make their way towards them.
The stopped about twenty feet from the group and stood there glaring
at the two slayer and their friends, the space in front of the vamps
began to waiver then emit a deep red glow, followed by a bright flash
that produced The Warlock.</p>

<p>Ciarán looked Buffy dead in the eyes, "Now I end this," snapped The
Warlock, motioning the vampires to attack.</p>

<p>Tara began chanting a protection spell for the groups as Willow
launched a rather large fireball towards the vampires only to have it
dissipated by The Warlock.</p>

<p>"It's not going to be that easy to win this time Mage," shouted The
Warlock.  He raised his hand into the air and shot a bolt of lighting
towards Buffy.</p>

<p>Willow quickly raised a magical shield around her beloved causing the
bolt to reflect back at The Warlock, sending him flying into the wall.</p>

<p>The vampires charged them, focusing primarily on Faith and Angel.
Buffy rushed over towards her fellow slayer and grabbed one of the
attacking vampires by the back of the collar and flung him across the
room.  She proceeded to grab another vamp by the chin and decapitated
him with her bare hands.</p>

<p>The Warlock stood up and launched a fireball towards Tara as she
continued her protection chant, Willow focused on the fireball as it
careened towards the blonde immortal and caused it to dissipate
seconds before it would have struck her.  She then turned her
attention back to The Warlock only to see a second fireball strike
the in the heart of the vampires who where attacking Angel.  She
stood there in horror as the vampires along with Angel where reduced
to ashes.</p>

<p>The Warlock then shot another fireball towards Faith and Buffy who
had just finished off the last of the vampires. He watched as the
fireball sailed through the air and struck an invisible barrier that
Willow had put between him and her friends.  </p>

<p>"Well done young Mage, unfortunately for you I have more than one
trick up my sleeve," replied the smirking Warlock as he vanished
before her eyes.</p>

<p>Cordelia knelt down and ran her hand through the ashes where Angel
had been fighting, tears started to stream down her cheeks as she
though of her friend and mentor and all that he had done for her.
She looked up at her friends who had formed a circle around her and
sobbed, "He's gone."</p>

<p>"And good riddance, there's nothing worse than evil gone good,"
snapped
Ciarán, reappearing next to Tara.  </p>

<p>The warlock reached out with his right arm and shot several bolts of
energy into Xander and Cordelia dropping both of them to the ground. </p>

<p>Ciarán looked at a stunned Willow, "It seems you have much to learn,"
he then turned towards Faith and looked her dead in the eye, "Since I
couldn't get you to leave I guess I'll just have to take something
you care about,"  Replied The Warlock as he grabbed Tara and vanished.</p>

<p>Faith sat in the waiting room crying, Tara was the first person that
she had actually loved, sure she had liked the others she had dated
in the past but she loved Tara.  </p>

<p>The brunette looked over at her fellow slayer and friend, "It's not
fair B.  She never did anything to hurt anyone, the only reason he
took her was because of me, she's gone and it's my fault," sobbed
Faith.</p>

<p>Buffy placed her hand on the brunettes' shoulder, "Faith listen to
me, it's not your fault, Tara was involved in this before you two
became an item.  The Warlock only said what he did to hurt you," her
voice was filled with compassion for her hurting friend as she looked
Faith in the eyes, "We'll find The Warlock and we'll get Tara back."</p>

<p>"And we'll make him pay," Added Faith as she wiped the tears from her
eyes.</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow sat next to Faith and continued to comfort their
friend as Giles paced back and forth across the waiting room.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart all this pacing isn't going to make the doctors get here
any faster," replied Joyce as she got up and went over to her fiancé.</p>

<p>Giles wrapped her arm around her, "I know, I can't help it, I think
of all of them as my children and…and this is…it's to much, I don't
know what to do," replied Giles, his eyes filling with tears.</p>

<p>"There's nothing we can do now but wait and see what the doctor has
to say."</p>

<p>"You're right, "sighed Giles, "but what about The Warlock."</p>

<p>"Rupert, you'll think of something, you always do," lovingly replied
Joyce.</p>

<p>"What if I can't," replied Giles his voice laces with doubt, "I've
already let them down once and look what happened."</p>

<p>"Rupert, you didn't let them down, there is no way you could have
know when or how The Warlock would attack," replied Joyce as she
tightly wrapped her arms around Giles.</p>

<p>The two of them stood there comforting one another till a voice
interrupted their moment, "Excuse me you wouldn't happen to be Mr.
Giles would you?"</p>

<p>Giles released Joyce from their embrace and turned to face the young
doctor, "How are they?"</p>

<p>"There stable," replied the doctor pausing for a moment to give the
older couple time to prepare themselves for what he was about to
say, "you might want to have a seat I have several things I need to
tell you about their conditions."</p>

<p>Giles and Joyce held tightly to one another's hand and he placed his
other arm around Faith.  Buffy grabbed a hold of her mom's hand and
wrapped her arms around Willows waste as the red head sat down on her
lap.  Giles looked to at the doctor, "OK, we're ready."</p>

<p>"Right now it's to early to speculate about either one of their
conditions.  The next forty-eight hours are going to be very critical
for both of them.  I will tell you what we do know at this point.
First of all I would like to start with your nieces condition Mr.
Giles."</p>

<p>"OK," replied the watcher, tightening his grip on Joyce's hand.</p>

<p>"She has suffered massive head trauma from the large amounts of
energy her body absorbed…she is currently unconscious, the next
couple of days will tell us what her chances of a full recovery are.
I wish I could tell you more but with that kind of injury it's
difficult to make any determination on her status until we have had
more time for observation.  Do you have any questions?"</p>

<p>"Any idea on what are we looking at with her?" nervously inquired
Giles.</p>

<p>"Like I said before it is still to early to tell.  All I can really
do at this point is give you the best and worst case scenario of what
could possibly happen.  The best-case scenario would of course be a
full recovery…I'm afraid that the worst-case scenario however would
be that she doesn't regain consciousness and lapses into a comma.
Before you start to panic I want to remind you that is the absolute
worst case scenario and we will do everything in our power to prevent
that from happening."</p>

<p>The doctor waited for a moment to allow them to absorb what he has
just said, "Do you need more time or do you wish for me to continue?"</p>

<p>"We'll be OK, what about Xander?"</p>

<p>"Your nephew is conscious, however I'm afraid that most of the damage
appears to be to the spinal cord.  Right now he has no feeling from
the waste down, but has full function of his upper body."</p>

<p>"Is he going to be paralyzed?"</p>

<p>"I simply don't know; it's just to early to tell."</p>

<p>Later that evening. . . .</p>

<p>Joyce nervously looked out the window as the sun began to set over
Sunnydale, she felt helpless, not only where Cordelia and Xander
badly injured but now Rupert, Buffy, Willow, and Faith where on their
way to face the monster who had put their friends in the trauma
center.  Tears rolled down her face as she leaned up against the
windowsill, and whispered a prayer to the Goddess, "please watch over
them and bring them back to me safety." </p>

<p>The group cautiously entered the warehouse that Willows tracking
spell had led them to.  Buffy and Faith were both prepared to attack
as they moved slowly into the main room, scanning it for any sign of
The Warlock or his allies, but found none.  The only one who was in
the room with them was Tara who was tied to a chair in the middle of
the room and gagged.  As Faith rushed to free her love, Buffy
motioned to Willow and Giles that the cost was clear.</p>

<p>Hidden in the shadows of the warehouse Torin the assassin stealthily
moved into position.  His unholy blood rapidly pulsed through his
body as the blonde slayer came into his sights.  The demon slowly
took aim with his ever-faithful blowgun and patiently waited for the
just the right moment to fire.</p>

<p>Faith grabbed the ropes that bound Tara to the chair and tore them in
half, as soon as she did the blonde reached up and yanked the gag
from her mouth, "Get out, it a trap!"</p>

<p>Torin blew into the gun sending the deadly dart towards an
unsuspecting slayer.  A sinister smile spread across his demonic face
as he watched the blonde grab at the dart that was now lodged in her
left shoulder, then collapse.</p>

<p>Willow dropped down to her knees next to Buffy and quickly removed
the dart from her shoulder.  She quickly scanned the area to see a
Grey demon moving quickly towards the door, "No," screamed the red
head as a blue bolt of light soared through the air the retreating
demon.</p>

<p>Torin dropped buckled over in pain as the magical energy scorched his
back.  Turning to face his attacker, Torin howled out in agony.  His
eyes filled with panic as he watched the red headed mages eyes
pulsate with power.</p>

<p>Willows hand began glowing a bright blue light as she pointed towards
the beast that had harmed her beloved, "Die".</p>

<p>A wave of magical energy shot from her hand and rippled through the
air towards the demon, and disintegrated the fowl creature as soon as
it struck.</p>

<p>Willow slowly kneeled down by Buffy's side, she found herself growing
dizzy, everything around her was becoming a blur, looked up at the
others who had rushed over to the fallen blondes side, "Something's
wrong," replied Willow in a weakened voice before collapsing next to
her beloved.</p>

<p>"How sad, the Warrior of Light and her Mage have fallen,"
sarcastically stated Ciarán as he appeared next to the group.</p>

<p>The Warlock looked down at the two young girls who laid motionless on
the grown, "Rupert, it would seem that I have won.  I would stay for
awhile and kill you and your slayer myself, but I have to prepare to
open the Hellmouth, so I'll leave that task to them," replied Ciarán,
pointing to the twenty plus vampires who where emerging on of the
back rooms of the warehouse.</p>

<p>The Warlock turned to Faith and Tara, "See how long you can last
without your friends," he snarled right before vanishing.</p>

<p>Faith and Giles took up fighting positions in-between the oncoming
vampires and Buffy and Willow as Tara quickly worked to put up a
protective shield over them.</p>

<p>The three of them stood there in shock as they watched all of the
advancing vampires burst into flames.</p>

<p>Faith and Giles both turned around to Tara who had just as a confused
look on her face as the others.</p>

<p>"Don't just stand their staring at each other, we have little time,
the poison is already destroying her," replied a voice of to the left
of them.</p>

<p>"Fey, what can we do to help them," inquired Tara as she turned to
meet her long time friend.</p>

<p>"We must rid the slayers blood of the poison it is the only way to
save the two of them."</p>

<p>"What do we need to do?" asked a very panicked Giles.</p>

<p>"There is nothing you can do," replied Fey as she turned to
Faith, "Only one of you can save them."</p>

<p>"Me?" questioned a rather confused slayer.</p>

<p>"Yes, Child…you."</p>

<p>Fey pulled a clear gem from her pouch and turned a way from the
group.  The immortal then began chanting causing the gem to glow,
after a few moments of this a brilliant light shot from the gem and
struck the wall she was facing and formed a passage way, "Quickly
gather up the fallen warriors and follow me through the portal, We
are running out of time," Commanded Fey.</p>

<p>Faith scooped up Buffy in her arms as Giles carefully picked up
Willow.  The three of them quickly made their way to the
passageway, "Were are we taking them," nervously asked Giles.</p>

<p>"Fey saw the concern in the watchers eyes, "The passage way is a
portal to the middle Ethereal, it is to there we must travel if they
are to be saved."</p>

<p>The watcher gave Fey a quick glance before heading down the pathway,
with Faith and Tara closely behind him.  When the group emerged on
the other side they found themselves standing in a large room that
had several beds scattered throughout it and was filled with what
appeared to be various types of medical equipment.  Each bed had a
magical circle drawn around it and a small table next to it that was
covered with various spell components.</p>

<p>"Do not be alarmed, We are in a healing room deep in the castle of
warrior Alexandria," Reassured Fey.  She looked Directly at
Faith, "Place the fallen Warrior on that bed, then lay down on the
one next to it, Fey then turned to Giles, "Place her in the bed next
to her beloved."</p>

<p>Faith stood next to the bed were Fey had told her to lay downn, she
took a quick look at the large bed that Buffy and Willow were lying
in before turning to Fey, "I want to help them, but I don't see how I
fit into this, I'm only a slayer."</p>

<p>Fey walked over to the slayer and put her hands on the brunette's
shoulders, "Child that is the very reason that you are the one who
can save them"</p>

<p>"I don't understand?"</p>

<p>"Her blood has been poisoned and it is killing the two of them.  The
only way to save them is a transfusion, and you are the only match."</p>

<p>Fey comfortingly placed her hands on Faiths shoulders," Child we are
standing within the Castle of Alexandria, keeper of the power of the
slayer.  You are just as much a child of hers as is the ultimate
slayer, the two of you share a proud and ancient lineage carried
throughout the ages by the powers of the Gods and Goddesses.  It is
through this that you are connected not only as comrades in arms but
as sisters, and like your sister you possess the rarest of all the
blood types, the one that holds the secrets of the slayers.  Through
your veins flows the power of the slayer and it is that blood that
will save them."</p>

<p>A tear rolled down Faiths cheek as she absorbed Feys words, for the
first time since she had been called the brunette had realized what
it means to be a slayer.  It didn't matter that her friend, no
sister, was a more powerful slayer than her, she still was a slayer
and part of something so grand that they are given their powers by
the heavens and watched over by the immortals. </p>

<p>Faith stepped back away from Fey and sat down on the smaller
bed, "Lets do it."</p>

<p>Fey smiled at the slayer, "Lay down child, Alexandria's healers will
be her shortly to prepare the equipment for the procedure, Fey slowly
looked over at Tara and motioned for her, "Come now child your
beloved needs you."</p>

<p>Tara nervously walked over to Faiths bed side and took a seat by the
brunette's side.  She squeezed Faiths hand and then began to gently
run her free hand through the brunettes' soft hair.  </p>

<p>Tara gazed at her girlfriend for a moment then looked to her age-old
mentor and friend, "Fey, I care for her deeply."</p>

<p>Fey could since the deep concern that racked Tara's voice, "I know
you do child, I also know that no matter what I say to you that your
mind will not be at ease until the transfusion is over and you can
see with your own eyes that she along with your friends are safe."</p>

<p>"But she is only one, I know of no spell that could possibly allow
for a safe transfusion with only one donor."</p>

<p>Fey almost chuckled at Tara's words but managed to hold it
back, "Sweet child just because you are unaware of such a spell does
not mean it doesn't exist, the healers have many magical items that
are kept her to aid in the healing process, it is one of these items
they are going to use on your beloved.  It will speed up her natural
healing ability so that her blood will rapidly replicate itself
during the transfusion."</p>

<p>Fey took a few steps away from the bed to make room for the several
healers who had quietly slipped in while she was talking to Faith and
Tara.</p>

<p>"Watcher, could you come with me, we would only be in the way here,
besides there is someone I would like you to meet."</p>

<p>Giles looked at the immortal, then over to the two beds where all his
surrogate daughters laid, then back to the immortal, "I would really
like to stay with them," softly wept Giles.</p>

<p>"They will be fine, the healers have been performing such task for
centuries.  You will best serve them by coming with me and seeing
that which no watcher has ever seen before."</p>

<p>Giles stood in the hall off the slayers in awe, all around him hand
painted on the murals was the history of the slayers, from the first
slayer all the way up to Buffy and Faith, they where all there.  He
watched as two of the castle artist worked on the portrait of Faith,
carefully painting in Tara by her side.  He would have been happy to
stand there lost in history but an unknown voice brought the watcher
back down to reality.</p>

<p>"Look carefully at what you are seeing watcher and head it well for
all of them are warriors of Gods and Goddesses who stand between
humanity and the demon realm," said a young woman wearing the cloths
of a mage.  Beside her was another woman who was dressed in leather
and armed with a sword. </p>

<p>The woman dressed in leather walked over to towards Giles and
Fey, "Hear her words well watcher.  The things that you see and hear
here today will forever change your life, but forgive us for our lack
of manner in not introducing ourselves, for we seldom get visitors
here.  I am Alexandria and this is my beloved Sabryn."</p>

<p>Giles was overcome by shock at the young women's words and sat down
in the chair closest to him, "Alexandria and Sabryn?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Replied Alexandria</p>

<p>"You're the keeper of the slayers and this is the hall of the
slayers," stammered Giles as where he was began to sink in.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that."</p>

<p>Fey left Giles side and walked over towards the two immortals.  She
looked at the watcher and smiled, "If I didn't know better I would
say he is about to go in shock."</p>

<p>Alexandria let out a hearty laugh, "It will pass, just give his mind
time to adjust to what is happening, after even though the watchers
are well versed in the book knowledge of this place and the story of
myself and Sabryn, until now none of them had seen this place or met
us.  It is understandable that he would be for a loss of words."</p>

<p>Sabryn and Fey both nodded in agreement at what Alexandria had just
said and the three of them took a seat across from the watcher and
waited for him to regain his senses.</p>

<p>After several minutes Giles had regained his composer enough to
speak,, "There's so much I want to ask about the slayers and how all
this fits together, but I don't know where to begin."</p>

<p>Sabryn stood up from here chair and walked over to the wall where the
artist where working, "throughout the ages many the philosopher has
said that it is best to start in the beginning, however seeing that
we do not have the time to cover the entire history of humanity and
the slayers it would be best to start with that which you know,"
stated the immortal as she pointed first to the picture of Buffy and
Willow, then to the one of Faith and Tara, "let us talk about the
slayers you have so valiantly served watcher."     </p>

<p>Alexandria then got up and joined her beloved by the murals, "tell us
when you look at their pictures and then look at the others what is
it that separates them from the others?"</p>

<p>Giles pondered Alexandria's question for a moment then it dawned on
him, "The others, they are alone in the pictures."</p>

<p>"Yes, and do you know why?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Alexandria paused a moment before continuing and wiped a tear from
her cheek, "It is because the they are the only slayers ever to find
there beloved.  All the others you see here fought the good fight
with courage and honor but did so without knowing the joy of true
love. They lived and died in the heat of battle, and that was all
they knew, such is the tragedy of the slayers."</p>

<p>Giles began to sob as the immortals worlds sunk home, their where so
many slayers shown on the walls, each of them a young girl called to
a higher destiny just like his two slayers, but none of them finding
love in their short lives.  Giles struggled to swallow back the tears
for the other slayers that was overcoming him, "It's not right, they
shouldn't have had to live like that."</p>

<p>"You are correct watcher, but sadly the nature of their calling for
the most part is a cruel fate, you are justified in weeping for the
other slayer. But I must remind you that things are different with
both of the slayers that have been entrusted in your care.  You
should rejoice for now both of them have overcome that that harsh
fate and know the love of another."</p>

<p>Sabryn wrapped her arm around Alexandria`s shoulder and softly spoke
to Giles, "Take this to heart watcher, because these two slayers have
managed to overcome the cruel fate of the slayers and found their
beloved's the nature of what it is to be a slayer has changed, if all
goes well there will be no more murals of young warriors standing
alone panted upon these walls."</p>

<p>Giles got up from his seat and looked at the murals of His
slayers, "They are changing that."</p>

<p>"Yes but not as much as you will watcher," replied Alexandria.</p>

<p>A look of puzzlement filled Giles face, "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"We wish you to be our emissary to the council.  You would guide them
on how to care for the slayers, show them that if they wish to fight
a good battle against the darkness that they first must cast aside
all their idiotic beliefs and test and love the slayers as if they
were their own daughters just as you have done.  You will instruct
them that not only are they to support their slayers in this manner
but to help them in the quest to find their soul mates."</p>

<p>"They won't listen to me."</p>

<p>"If you where just a watcher that would be correct, but as our
emissary they will have no choice but to follow your instruction, for
they are still held accountable to our house."</p>

<p>"I think I understand what you're saying."</p>

<p>Alexandria smiled at Giles and motioned for him to sit back
down, "Good for now that is all that is required of you."</p>

<p>Giles took his seat and waited for the others to do the same, "I have
some more questions for you."</p>

<p>"You wish to know what is happening to your slayers."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"They share the same lineage as all slayers do, but both of them have
a destiny far greater than any of their sisters past."</p>

<p>Sabryn picked up the conversation as soon as Alexandria paused, "One
has already started to achieve her destiny by becoming the ultimate
slayer and the others destiny is just beginning to unfold, but the
nature of that destiny is one that will not be revealed until she is
ready to accept it." </p>

<p>Giles was getting ready to put another question on the table when one
of the healers walked into the hall, "We are done."</p>

<p>Fey stood up and walked over to the healer with the others right
behind her, "How are they."</p>

<p>"They are well, the transfusion went well, all of them will have a
full recovery."</p>

<p>"Can I see them now," impatiently interrupted Giles.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you must keep it short, they need their rest."</p>

<p>Everyone stood around the two beds in the healing room.  Tara
snuggled up next to Faith and was placing tender kisses on the
weakened slayers forehead.  Buffy and Willow where cuddled up next to
one another two tired really do anything but take comfort in the fact
that the other was going to be fine.  As Giles watched the four of
them he felt a wave of relief come over him, for now his daughters
were safe.</p>

<p>Fey walked over to where the chair at the foot of the two bed where
Giles had sat down and tapped the watcher on the shoulder, "You must
now return to outer earth and let the others know that all of you are
fine.  The for of them will spend the night here and be returned to
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Can't they come back now," pleaded Giles.</p>

<p>"No they are to weak to travel, plus the magic of this Realm will
enhanced their recovery.  By morning they will be back up to power,
besides the four of them have some visions that are easier shared
with them when they are in the Ethereal.  So return to your friends
and loved ones and take heart in the fact that they are safe and will
be returning to you shortly."</p>

<p>After Fey had finished speaking the room seemed to start to spin
around the watcher as everything became Blurry.  When it cleared up
he found that he was no longer in the Middle Ethereal but on his
front porch and alone.  He reached in his jacket pocket and produced
a house key, and started to chuckle.  After all they have been
through tonight all he could think of was how he was going to explain
what had happened to Joyce.</p>

<p>Within the Dream World...</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow walked hand in hand through a vast garden.  It was
filled with every kind of plant imaginable and some that where beyond
imagination.  Throughout the Garden there was magnificent sculptures
that would rival those of the Roman Empire.  As they walked through
the garden they found them selves drawn to a large fountain in its
center.  The fountain was made of marble and had a statue of them
along with Faith and Tara as it's center piece.  Sitting on the bench
next to it where Tara and Faith who also seemed drawn to this
fountain.</p>

<p>"Hey how did you guys get here," Questioned Buffy.</p>

<p>""Not sure B, last thing I remember was falling a sleep next to Tara
and presto we found ourselves here."</p>

<p>"So do either of you know where here is?"</p>

<p>Tara ran her hand through Faiths hair as she stood up, "We are in the
warriors garden just outside Alexandria's castle."</p>

<p>"How'd you know that," questioned Willow.</p>

<p>"My Mom and Fey used to bring me here a lot before I was sent to
outer Earth, though I don't recall ever seeing this fountain before."</p>

<p>"That's because it hasn't been built yet child," replied Fey as she
rounded the corner.</p>

<p>The four young Women spun around and stared blankly at Fey for a
moment.  "What do you mean it hasn't been built yet," demanded Faith.</p>

<p>Fey grinned at Faith, "You are definitely as spirited one to say the
least," she then motioned towards the benches that surrounded the
fountain, "Come sit with me and I will answer your question and tell
you why the four of you have been brought here."</p>

<p>Fey waited for the four of them to take their seats and
continued, "It hasn't been built yet because the four of you are in
the dream world, what you are looking at is the Warriors garden of
the future.  This fountain is the heart of the garden because and
represents the greatest of the slayers and their soulmates." </p>

<p>Willow looked dircely at Fey, "Why have we been brought here."</p>

<p>"I thought it would be nice for you to see this place, the four of
you are just now starting to embark on the path that will lead to
this fountain being built in your honor, but before you go down that
path there are some things that you must know first."</p>

<p>"Like what," quipped Buffy.</p>

<p>"Yeah what," added Faith.</p>

<p>"For starters is anyone interested in knowing why Willow fell when
Buffy did."</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow both looked at one another and pondered the question
that had just been put to them.  After a brief moment the two of them
turned their attention back to Fey and shook their heads yes.</p>

<p>"When the two of you declared your love for one another and Buffy
awoke as the ultimate slayer the powers to be in their wisdom bonded
you to one another, so what happens to one of you is felt by the
other.  Your beloved fell with you slayer because the nature of that
bond created will not allow one to exist with out the other."</p>

<p>"Wait a second your saying that if I would for some reason get taken
out in a fight or heaven forbid something would happen to Willow the
other one of us would..."</p>

<p>"Also perish, it is the what that it has to be, the two of you have
been blessed with great power, together you are a near unstoppable
force against the darkness, but with great power comes great cost.
You see child when one is dealing with the powers that be everything
is about balance, it is the only way the universe can survive."</p>

<p>"OK, I'm just a little bit confused here, please explain that to me
in English," snapped a rather frustrated Buffy.</p>

<p>"Buffy you are now the most powerful slayer ever to walk the earth,
but you are quick to react and often leap before you think things
through.  Willow who is rapidly becoming a powerful mage is the
opposite, she is cautious and tries to plan things through to the
finest detail, a lot of times to her own hindrance.  However together
the two of you balance one another, and that is a balance that must
be maintained at all cost."</p>

<p>"But why if something should happen to one of us does it need to
happen to the other."</p>

<p>"It is to maintain the balance, besides the two of you shouldn't fret
over this, I foresee you sharing a long and prosperous life together."</p>

<p>"Buffy smiled when she heard Fey's reassuring words.  The blonde
slayer wrapped her arms around Willow and placed a tender kiss on the
redhead's lips, "I think I could live with that."</p>

<p>"Me to," added Willow just before returning Buffy's kiss.</p>

<p>"W-what about us," nervously asked Tara.</p>

<p>"Child the two of you also have a destiny together but it is a very
different path than the one that your friends are embarking on."</p>

<p>"What is it."</p>

<p>Fey walked over next to Faith and Tara and put a hand on each of the
girls shoulder, "It is not yet time, before the destiny the two of
you have ahead of you can be revealed there is a battle to be fought."</p>

<p>Faith tightened her grip on Tara's hand, "Ciarán."</p>

<p>"Correct child, the time has come for the four of you to face and
banish the warlock, and I shall show you how to do it."</p>

<p>Outer Earth:</p>

<p>Giles held Joyce tightly as they waited for the two slayers and their
perspective soulmates to return from the Middle Ethereal.  He wanted
to comfort Joyce, to tell her that everything was going to be OK but
he couldn't, all he really could do is tell her that when he left
them all four girls where safe, and hold on to her.  He loved all
four girls like they where his own daughters, but he knew that all of
this was taking a bigger toll on Joyce, after all she was Buffy's
mom, and their was nothing he could do to help her through this
except be there for her.</p>

<p>Joyce rested her head on Giles shoulders and wandered what was going
through his mind. She knew he had done his best to assure her that
Buffy and the others where well and safe but she could tell by the
sound of his voice that he was worried. She couldn't blame him
because she was worried too.  The Warlock had already put Xander and
Cordelia in the hospital, killed Angel, and then almost killed her
daughter, but that's not worried her.  It was the Warlock himself
that she found herself thinking about. She couldn't get him out of
her mind.  Ever since she learned that Buffy was the Slayer she was
deeply worried for her daughters' safety, but she also realized that
Buffy could take care of herself.  Which she always did, along with
Willows help and the help of the others she always managed to
survive, but this time was different, this time she had seen the evil
that her daughter had to fight first hand.</p>

<p>Middle Ethereal:</p>

<p>Willow sat in Buffy's lap with her head resting on the blonde
slayer's shoulder.  Across from them Tara and Faith sat on another
one of the benches in Alexandria's Garden.  She watched them as they
whispered amongst themselves for a moment then turned her attention
back to Buffy, tilting her head just right so she could place a
gentle kiss on her soulmates lips.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled at Willow and tenderly ran her hands through her
soulmates silky red hair, "That's nice."</p>

<p>Willow blushed slightly and snuggled up even closer to Buffy and the
blonde slayer began to place gentle kisses on her neck.</p>

<p>"Hmmm...I hate to interrupt you but there are something's I need to
cover before your sent back to face the Warlock," Fey replied as she
approached the four young women.</p>

<p>"Like what," Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Like how the only way you can defeat him is to banish him."</p>

<p>"Banish him, why can't we just slay him," Faith replied.</p>

<p>"You could, but Ciarán is a powerful warlock and it is very likely
that he would take a couple of you with him in the prolonged fight it
would take to slay him."</p>

<p>Faith looked at Tara then over at Buffy and Willow, "So how do we
banish him?"</p>

<p>Outer Earth:</p>

<p>Giles and Joyce both leapt off of the couch when Buffy, Willow, Faith
and Tara returned.  They rushed over to the young women and began to
hug them, checking to see if they were all right.</p>

<p>After several minutes of hugging the girls broke away from Giles and
Joyce, Buffy looked at her mom then at her soon to be step-dad, "You
guys might want to sit down, we need to talk."</p>

<p>Giles and Joyce walked back over to the couch and sat down
immediately grabbing each other's hand, "OK Buffy what's going on,"
Joyce replied in a very motherly voice.</p>

<p>"We have to face the Warlock and we have to do it before tonight."</p>

<p>Giles stood up and walked over towards the four of them, "Why so
soon? We should take time and prepare, especially after what happened
last night, besides all of you should rest some."</p>

<p>"We don't have the time for that."</p>

<p>"Buffy is right Giles," Willow replied, "from what Fey said all the
stars will be in there proper alignment tonight for him to open the
Hellmouth for good, if we don't strike now it will be to late."</p>

<p>"Besides," added Buffy, "not only did Fey show us were to find the
Warlock, she also gave us something to put an end to him."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"This," answered Tara, producing a glistening red gem that was
triangular in shape.</p>

<p>"Th-th-that's...a," stammered Giles.</p>

<p>"Banishing Crystal," Tara replied.</p>

<p>"I didn't think any of them still existed."</p>

<p>"On Outer Earth they don't, but we were in the Middle Ethereal." </p>

<p>Middle Ethereal:</p>

<p>Fey, stood alongside Alexandria and Sabryn in the Hal of Slayers. The
three of them were staring into a mirror with golden trim that was
hung on the wall.  Through it they watched as the for chosen warriors
made their way to the warehouse that Fey had revealed to them as the
lair of the Warlock.</p>

<p>"Do you think they can do it," Alexandria inquired.</p>

<p>"They have to or all is lost," Fey replied.</p>

<p>Outer Earth:</p>

<p>Ciarán was packing up the last of the supplies he needed for
tonight's ceremony when the door to the warehouse flew open.</p>

<p>"Warlock, we have some business to settle," shouted Faith as her and
Buffy stormed through the door with Willow and Tara right behind them
chanting a protection spell for the two slayers.</p>

<p>Ciarán grinned wickedly, "So you think you have business with me,
tell me this Slayer. Do you really think you can win?" He then looked
at Buffy and Willow and snarled, "Shouldn't the two of you be dead?"</p>

<p>"Sorry to disappoint you," quipped Buffy.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it, I plan on changing that circumstance right
now," growled the warlock as he raised his hands into the air and
shot a bolt of energy right at Buffy.</p>

<p>The bolt soared directly towards here but immediately dissipated when
it hit the protective field that Willow and Tara had through up over
the slayers.</p>

<p>"Somebody's been practicing, try and stop this."</p>

<p>The Warlock then launched a fireball at the four of them but it to
was stopped by the field, however both Willow and Tara could feel the
field beginning to weaken under the warlocks onslaught.</p>

<p>"You guys got to do something about this, I don't think the field can
take much more," Willow shouted.</p>

<p>"Sure thing Red."</p>

<p>"Your wish is my command," replied Buffy as she gave Willow a quick
peck on the cheek for good luck before springing into action.</p>

<p>Buffy rushed the warlock from the right and Faith from the left.  He
waved his hands through the air and sent Buffy falling to the ground,
only to be blind sided by Faith.</p>

<p>As the Slayers fought the warlock Willow and Tara quickly drew a
circle outline on the ground and sat down inside of it, they then
placed the Banishing Crystal in the center of the circle and began
the chant Fey had taught them a few hours ago.</p>

<p>Ciarán spun around in rage and lifted his right hand in the air. It
began to glow with magical energy, "See if that puny protective field
can withstand this."</p>

<p>Before the warlock could cast his spell Buffy swept his legs out from
under him.  He fell flat on his back and the energy blast that was
ment for Faith shot up straight into the air and blew a large hole in
the warehouse ceiling sending rubble falling down around them.</p>

<p>"Thanks, B."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it, I kinda owed you one."</p>

<p>Faith rushed up to the warlock and kicked him square in the ribs as
he tried to get up, "That's for trying to make me feel like nothing."</p>

<p>Buffy then kicked him from the other side, "And that's for trying to
kill me and Willow."</p>

<p>Ciarán vanished before either one of the slayers could get in another
punch.  He re-appeared several feet away from them, "And this is for
thinking you could beat me."</p>

<p>The warlock then shot out several bolts of lighting at the two
slayers completely dissipating the protective field and sending the
two of them flying backwards.</p>

<p>Buffy and Faith quickly jumped to their feet and took a defensive
stance.</p>

<p>The warlock stared at them for a moment then raised both his hands
towards the ceiling,.  A large ball of fire formed above his
head, "Now I end this."</p>

<p>"Buffy, Faith...NOW," Shouted Tara causing the two slayers to dive
towards the wall of the warehouse.</p>

<p>A bright beam of blue light shot from the banishing stone and struck
the warlock in the chest lifting him up off of the ground and
canceling out his spell.</p>

<p>He screamed in agony as the gems power opened up a porthole to Limbo
around him.  The two slayers picked themselves off of the floor and
watched in astonishment as the field of light grew brighter and
brighter, then simply vanished into nothingness along with the warlock</p>

<p>They walked over to Willow and Tara and helped their perspective
soulmates up off of the warehouse floor.</p>

<p>"So what now," Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Don't know about you B, but I think I'm gonna spend some quality
time with Tara."</p>

<p>"Sounds good to me," Tara replied before wrapping her arms around
Faith's waste.</p>

<p>Buffy turned to Willow and saw that she was grinning from ear to ear.</p>

<p>The redhead walked over to her and placed her hands on her
shoulders, "I think we should let Giles and your mom know we are OK."</p>

<p>Buffy's voice was filled with a little disappointment, "Oh, I guess
that's true."</p>

<p>Willow playfully punched her in the arm. "Then, afterwards, I have
special plans for you."</p>

<p>"That'll work," Buffy replied.</p>

<p>Buffy then looked over at Faith and Tara, "Hey we're going to let
everyone know we're still alive. We'll see you guys tomorrow."</p>

<p>Before Faith or Tara could respond there was a bright flash of light
and the two of them vanished before Buffy and Willow's eyes.</p>

<p>Buffy protectively wrapped her arms around Willow, "What's going on
here?"</p>

<p>"Fear not child," Fey said in a reassuring voice as she materialized
to the left of them, "the battle is won and they are safe."</p>

<p>"What happened to them."</p>

<p>"They have been sent to the Middle Ethereal."</p>

<p>"Why," Buffy and Willow asked in unison.</p>

<p>"The time has come for their destiny to be revealed."</p>

<p>
Inner Earth:</p>

<p>Lord Laos flung his seeing gem across his chambers in rage; he
couldn't believe what he had just seen.  Not only had the slayers and
witches defeated the warlock but they did so before he could open the
Hellmouth thus preventing his minions access to Outer Earth.</p>

<p>The Demon Prince let out a guttural grown that echoed throw the
bowels of his lair; "This is far from over!"</p>

<p>Middle Ethereal:</p>

<p>Tara and Faith found themselves standing in a cottage that the
brunette slayer didn't recognize. Faith watched as Tara's eyes ran
