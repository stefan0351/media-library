<p>I talked to Wesley today, he told me that the powers of light have finally
called a slayer and that the council is once again back in business. I
believe from what I saw of her when we were fighting Vlad Tepes that Kathryn
will make an excellent slayer, especially with Archer as her watcher. I
wish the both of them the best of luck.</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow closed the third Hellsmouth today and we will be leaving
Argentina and going to Los Angeles for Angel and Cordelia's wedding before
heading to Germany and the forth Hellsmouth. From what I learned
in the forever I believe that we still have approximately twenty three
remaining Hellsmouths, I believe most of them are inactive like the one in
Argentina so hopefully it will not take much longer to seal them. The
hardest part has been locating them even with the divining rod the Goddess
gave me it has not been easy to locate them.</p>

<p>Angel and Cordelia’s weeding was a total success even though it took place
at one in the morning. However it did get Buffy and Willow thinking and
they finally set a date for their own wedding. Both the girls Moms were
overjoyed that they are finally tying the knot, and I have to admit that that
I am pretty happy myself. It is about time they took that final plunge.</p>

<p>We finally located the fourth Hellsmouth and closed it. Now we are heading
towards Austria were I believe the fifth Hellsmouth is. Hopefully we will
be able to keep up this pace and put an end to these Hellsmouths forever.</p>

<p>We are still searching Austria for the fifth Hellsmouth. I know we are
close but it has been inactive for a long time and is well hidden. I pray
that we will find it soon so we can move one to the next one and close it
before the wedding in September.</p>

<p>We Finally located the fifth Hellsmouth and sealed it and Will be heading
towards Germany tomorrow. From what I have learned in our travels I believe
that their are two Hellsmouths in this country. One around Berlin and
another at Bonn. It would appear however that we are once again fortunate
and that both of them have been inactive for awhile.</p>

<p>Well the Hellsmouth outside of Berlin is sealed and now we are heading
towards Bonn. Buffy and Willow are running up a rather large phone bill as
they plan the wedding with their moms but the council; is more than willing
to pay for it, though they do not have much of a choice since the Goddess
made them subservient to the Bladesinger, though I think Buffy is enjoying
her new relationship with the council a little to much, after all it is not
really necessary to insist that they ensure that each hotel we go to have
fresh doughnuts waiting. She says after what they did to her when she was a
slayer they should be glad she doesn’t make them deliver the doughnuts in
person.</p>

<p>The sixths Hellsmouth is now sealed and we are going to take a break and
head back towards Sunnydale so the girls can get ready for their wedding. I
find myself getting more excited each day it grows closer, I can barely
believe they both asked me to give them away. I am more than happy to do it
and hope that I will be able to help make their wedding day a memorable one.</p>

<p>The ceremony was fantastic, the best part was when I got to toast Buffy and
Willow Summers. It was nice to see everyone expectably Xander and Anya. It
was the first time the three of this got to see their daughter Victoria in
person. I am going to stay in Sunnydale for a couple of weeks as Buffy and
Willow go on a Caribbean cruise for their Honeymoon.</p>
