<!-- Legend \ Chapter 6: Tribulations -->

<p>Angel awoke, every inch of his body ached,  slowly he became aware of
his surroundings.  He tried to break free of the chains that held him
to the wall, but he was unable to do so.  The events of last night
that brought him here were a blur,  he remembered encountering Vlad
Tepes and Spike and fighting with them, but pass that everything was
hazy.  The last thing he could recall was being knocked to the ground
by Vlad only to have something very heavy strike him in the head,
after that he only remembered a few moments ago when he woke up.  He
continued to struggle trying to break free of the chains but he
couldn't, that's when he noticed her.  Accrosed the room from
him were a series of  makeshift cages, all of them were empty except
one that held a very terrified Anya.</p>

<p>Giles paced back in forth in the waiting room of the trauma center,
the worry clearly showing on his face.  What happened last night, He
thought to himself.  First there was the call from Buffy that Willow
had been attacked but was O.K., Then came a call from Xander that
Spike had attacked him and taken Anya.  That had been several hours
ago and now he was at the hospital with Buffy and Willow, the three
of them waiting for Xander to get out of surgery.  He was a nervous
wreck, he had always looked at the group as if they were his own
children and now two of them had been attacked, putting one of them
in the hospital.  Then to make matters even worse the sun had been up
for a few hours and Angel had never made it back. He was still trying
to piece together everything that had transpired last night, but one
thing was for sure Vlad Tepes had made his move.</p>

<p>Back at Giles place Wesley and Quentin were going through every book
they had at their disposal, they had to find something that would aid
the slayer.  The problem was the same one they had encountered from
the beginning of all of this, there simply were no prophecies on Vlad
Tepes Dracul, and besides the normal way of killing vampires there
were no hints on how to defeat him.  Every account they could find of
were a slayer or someone from the council faced him had the same
result, the Master Vampyre had won.  Both of them knew that they had
to come up with something soon, before any more of the group aiding
the slayer fell prey to the Master Vampyre.  As the two of them
continued to muddle through their books Megan sat of in a corner in a
trance, she was once again trying to reach out with her mind, to try
and learn something of Vlad Tepes and his plans.  As she did this
Cordelia sat alone on the couch, she had wanted to go to the hospital
with the others but she couldn't bring herself to leave the
house.  She was hoping by some miracle Angel would make it back there
or at least call, but deep inside her she knew that it was only
wishful thinking.</p>

<p>Angel was talking with Anya, so far he had been able to determine
that she had not been hurt but Spike had done a number on Xander.
However their conversation was interrupted when Vlad and Spike walked
into the room.  Spike walked over to the fire place and started a
fire, as Vlad walked over in front of Angel slapping him hard
accross the face when he got there.</p>

<p>He then looked at Angel, "How dare you betray your brethren, I
shall teach you the price of such treachery"</p>

<p>Vlad then walked over to the fire place and pulled a long sword from
the mantle, he proceeded to stick its blade into the flames.  Turning
towards Angel as he held the weapon in the fire, "Shall we
begin"</p>

<p>Buffy had her armed wrapped around the redhead who had leaned up
against her shoulder and fallen asleep in the waiting room.  The
slayer motioned for Giles to come over and have a seat next to them,
and he obliged.</p>

<p>"What is it Buffy"</p>

<p>The slayers eyes filled with sadness as she spoke, "They almost
got her last night."</p>

<p>"But they didn't, you stopped them before they could harm
her"</p>

<p>"What what if I was a few seconds later, What then", a tear
rolled down the slayers cheek as she finished speaking, even the
thought of something happening to Willow hurt her.</p>

<p>Giles could see what the blonde was going through and tried to
comfort her, "It didn't happen that way, she is here with you
and she is safe.  Don't let yourself get caught up in what if
this
happened."</p>

<p>"I can't help it, I love her so much, I don't know what I
would do if something ever happened," Buffy was starting to cry,
and
Giles put his hand on her shoulder in a effort to comfort his
surrogate daughter.</p>

<p>He then looked at the slayer, "I want the two of you to come stay
at my place with the rest of us until this is over,  she will be
safer there, after all it is much harder for a vampire to get into a
house than it is a dorm."</p>

<p>Buffy looked at her watcher and smiled, "Thanks."</p>

<p>Buffy then looked over at her love, she leaned her head up against
the redhead and softly spoke, "Don't worry Wills, I won't let
anyone hurt you"</p>

<p>Angel screamed out in pain as Vlad once again ran the red hot blade
accrosed his chest barely cutting into the top layer of skin.  This
had been going on for over an hour now and Angel's chest was
covered with a series of rather nasty slash marks complete with third
degree burns that the red hot sword had caused.  The master Vampyre
paused for a second and looked at Spike, "William you know what
the best part of this is"</p>

<p>"Hearing him scream" Replied the blonde vampire.</p>

<p>A smiling Vlad replied, "No, it is amusing to hear this traitors
cries of pain but I think the best part is that I can do this forever
and he won`t die from it," when he had finished speaking he
once again ran the burning blade accrosed the traitors chest as his
victim screamed out in anguish.</p>

<p>Giles was getting back up to start pacing the room again when a nurse
walked in, "Excuse me are you the ones here for Alexander
Harris"</p>

<p>Buffy softly shook Willow easing her out of her sleep as Giles
answered the Nurse, "Yes, is He O.K.? Can we see him?"</p>

<p>The nurse walked over to them and motioned for Giles to sit down.  He
took a seat on the couch next to Buffy and waited for the nurses
answer.</p>

<p>"He has been injured pretty bad, but the doctors expect him to
make a full recovery.  It however is going to take a while for that
to happen and he will need your help while he recovers.  I should
warn you before you go see him, the injuries he sustained were
serious and he might not look like his usual self"</p>

<p>"How bad is he," Questioned Giles his voice showing all the
concern of a worried parent.</p>

<p>"His left leg is broken in three places, and there is a hairline
fracture on his hip.  Three ribs were broken and the rest of them
bruised, His right shoulder has been dislocated and the Right arm
broken.  Also he is covered with bruises, and has some swelling in
the facial area along with a broken jaw, so he will not be able to
talk that much for awhile,"  The nurse paused for a second to
let
the information sink in and then she continued, "There was some
internal bleeding but the doctors were able to stop that.  All of
this has put him in a great deal of pain, so he is heavily medicated
right now.  I'm going to take you to see him, but you can only
stay
for a few minutes and he will be fairly much incoherent"</p>

<p>Megan jumped up out of the corner and rushed over to the table that
Quentin and Wesley were doing their research at. "I had a vision,
I saw the Master Vampyre"</p>

<p>Both of them men immediately stopped what they were doing and gave
Megan their full attention.  Quentin looked at her, "What was it
that you saw?"</p>

<p>"I saw the missing vampire that had been helping us, He is in
great pain.  I believe that Vlad Tepes is torturing him.  I also
saw
the girl that was taken, she is being held inside some kind of
cage."</p>

<p>"Was there anything else" Quentin questioned.</p>

<p>"Yes, everything then faded and I saw Vlad Tepes standing over
you laughing"</p>

<p>Vlad had been torturing him for hours now,  his pain was so great
that it even hurt to breath.  Angel wasn't sure how much more he
could take, he silently wished that his tormentor would just end it
and kill him.  Angel watched as Vlad had put the long sword up and
produced a dagger from his belt, "Well I see that you survived
round one, lets see how you deal with this," snarled Vlad his
voice
laced with hate for the traitor.</p>

<p>Vlad then walked over to Angel and looked over the vampires body.
His chest and abdomen were covered with the slash marks that had made
over the last couple of hours.  Vlad Smiled as he took the dagger and
rammed it into Angels left shoulder.  Spike then walked over carrying
a large silver tray that had a cloth draped over it.  The blonde
vampire sat it down next to Vlad, who removed the cover revealing the
twenty daggers that laid upon the tray.  Vlad grabbed one of them and
Angel howled out in pain as the dagger was rammed it into his other
shoulder.  Vlad then looked at Angel, "Two down, nineteen to
go", He then turned  at Spike as he picked up a dagger, "Take
the
girl's cage to another room, I am growing tired of her
sobbing"</p>

<p>Anya sat trembling in her cage, she could no longer see what was
happening to Angel from the room Spike had pushed her cell into, but
she still could hear his cries.  She was terrified by what she had
witnessed, even as a vengeance demon she had rarely seen torture of
that magnitude.  She feared that when he was done with Angel that she
would be next, she curled up in a ball in a corner of the cage, her
body still trembling and continued to weep.</p>

<p>Giles and the two girls had just returned from the hospital, and
given the group a report on Xander's condition, then a rather shaken
up Quentin briefed them on what Megan had seen, his voice filled with
anxiety as he mentioned her vision of his own demise.  The Slayer
then walked over to the table and looked at the council members and
turned to Giles, "It's going to be dark soon, I had better
get ready for patrol"</p>

<p>As soon as Buffy spoke Willow jumped up from her chair and rushed to
the slayers side wrapping both her arms around the blonde.
Desperation filled her eyes as she looked at Giles, "You
can't let her go out, not after what happened last night.  She
doesn't have anyone to help her now," pleaded the redhead.</p>

<p>Giles turned and faced Quentin, "She's right, slayer or not,
We can't allow Buffy to go out there by herself with Vlad Tepes
and
his vampires roaming around"</p>

<p>Quentin looked at the slayer then to Giles, "I tend to agree, but
we just can't sit around and wait for him to come to us, what
would
you suggest"</p>

<p>"I'll go with her.  After all, My magic is coming along
rather nicely,"  Piped in Willow.  She was terrified at the
aspect of
going out with Dracul running around, but there was no way she was
going to let Buffy go out there alone.</p>

<p>"No you won't," Responded Buffy as she hugged Willow ,
"There is no way I am going to allow you to go out there.  I
couldn't
go on if anything were to happen to you.  I need you here, where I
know your safe." </p>

<p>Giles looked at the two of them and then spoke, "I'll go."</p>

<p>Before anyone could respond Wesley spoke up, "So will I"</p>

<p>Quentin looked at Wesley and Giles, "Then it is decided, Giles
and Wesley arm yourselves up.  You're going on patrol with the
slayer."</p>

<p>Angel had daggers protruding all up and down his arms and legs, one
of the daggers had been completely run through his right hand.  The
vampire was now openly weeping from the immense pain that racked
through his body, as he pleaded with the Master vampyre to kill him.  </p>

<p>Vlad held the remaining dagger in his hand and turned to
Spike, "William I am having to much fun with this.  I believe I
will stay in tonight, but I need to test the slayer.  Send out some
of my children to attack her, tell them that if she starts to get the
upper hand, which I feel she will, that they are to retreat.  Also
could you send someone out to grab me something to eat, preferably
someone young and have them to get something for you too"</p>

<p>"As you wish Master," said the blonde vamp, "I take it
you wish for me to stay here."</p>

<p>"Yes, I wish to talk with you about what we are going to do to
capture the redheaded witch you told me about," as soon as Vlad
had finished speaking he turned away from Spike and rammed the last
dagger through Angels other hand resulting in another plea for death
from the traitor.</p>

<p>The three of them walked through the cemetery.  Buffy was in front as
Giles and Wesley followed, Giles was armed with a crossbow and Wesley
carried two super soakers filled with holy water. As soon as they
turned the corner into the first cemetery on their list of places to
patrol six vamps jumped out in front of them.  Giles let loose with
the crossbow turning one to dust and immediately began to reload.  </p>

<p>Wesley opened fire hitting a vamp, sending him screaming to the
ground.   Buffy instantly attacked, connecting a roundhouse on
one vamp and caching another with a leg sweep.  She then dropped to her
knees staking the vamp she got with the leg sweep and dusting him.  </p>

<p>The other vamp then jumped on her back before she could get back up
only to be hit with a barrage of holy water from Wesley.  Giles then
fired his crossbow at one of the vamps but missed his mark.  As Buffy
took up a fighting stance the two remaining vamps looked at one
another and ran away.  The slayer looked at the two men, "Well I
never had them run away like that before."</p>

<p>The others sat there watching Willow as she paced back and forth
accross the room saying her prayers to the Goddess on Buffy`s
behalf, they had somewhat of an idea of what she was going through,
they too were all worried about the slayer, Giles, and Wesley.  They
also knew that the feelings of concern that swept over them were
nothing to what the redhead was going through, sure they cared about
the group that was out patrolling and hoped for their safe return,
but she was in love with the slayer and at night in the Hellsmouth
that could be a very hard thing to deal with, especially knowing that
the master vampyre was also out there.</p>

<p>They were just finishing the patrol of the first cemetery when
Buffy's slayer senses kicked in.  She alerted the others and the
three of them took up fighting stances.  Four vampires were
approaching from the left and Wesley took aim at them, as Giles
pointed a loaded crossbow towards the seven vampires coming from the
right.  Giles fired and hit a vamp reducing him to ash as Wesley
managed to get two of them with the super soakers.  The vamps
immediately rushed in for the attack ignoring the two men and
concentrating on the slayer.  Buffy leg swept the first one that got
there only to be grabbed by two others. Using them as support she
lifted herself up off the ground and kicked a vamp that was in front
of her square in the face sending him reeling backwards to the
ground. She then stomped on one of the vamps foot as hard as she
could, and when she did he let go of her.  She then flipped the other
vamp to the ground and staked him as soon as he hit.  The vamp whose
foot she had trampled on lunged at her but she gracefully rolled out
of his way causing him to miss and land face first on the ground, and
staked him from behind before he could react.  A vampire grabbed her
from behind as she got back up, the slayer broke his grip  and spun
around sweeping his legs out from under him only to get hit from
behind by another vamp who was staked by Giles before he could do any
more damage.  As soon as Buffy hit the ground she was back up but so
was the vamp that she had previously knocked down.  Before she could
fight him he was hit from behind by a well aimed shot of holy water.
Buffy then turned her attention towards the remaining  four vampires
only to see them running away.</p>

<p>"Are you alright," Asked Giles, wanting to make sure the
slayer wasn't hurt by the blow to the head she had taken.</p>

<p>"Yeah, it's just a bump.  How about you two"</p>

<p>"Were fine they seemed not to be concerned with us at all,"
Giles responded trying to figure out why Wesley and himself were
ignored and while for the second time tonight vampires had run from
them.</p>

<p>Four vampires entered the mansion dragging two  young girls from
the
Sunnydale campus with them.  Vlad who had just removed the last
dagger from Angel looked at Spike, "William, it looks like our
dinners here"</p>

<p>After the two of them had feed Vlad looked at Spike, "So the
Slayer and the redheaded witch are in love"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Spike glad that the master vampyre seemed
very happy with the information he had given him.</p>

<p>"Then she will be the key to turning the slayer."</p>

<p>"Master, You wish to turn the slayer," Spikes voice was
filled with confusion over his master statement, usually they just
killed the slayers, if they could.</p>

<p>"I see you are puzzled, let me explain.  If I kill her another
will be called, then another.  It never ends, I spent over a hundred
and twenty years killing slayers and watchers only to have more pop
up.  However a slayer can only be called when the current one dies,
so by turning her no replacement will come."</p>

<p>"I see Master, but  I must tell you that by some sort of accident
there is a second slayer"</p>

<p>"I am aware of that.  Correct me if I am wrong but the second
slayer is in a comma"</p>

<p>"You're correct, Master"</p>

<p>"Then we will ensure she stays that way and allow her to die of
natural causes, by then it will be to late,  with no slayer to stand
in our way we will have overrun the world ," Vlad paused for a
second, "Now back to the witch"</p>

<p>They were headed back towards Giles house after having been attacked
three other times by various groups of vampires.  Both the men had a
few bumps and bruises, but Buffy had several scratch marks and was
bruised all over mainly because of one thing, each of the attacks
followed the same pattern as the first two.  The vampires would
concentrate on Buffy, ignoring Giles and Wesley and as soon as they
started to win the fight the remaining vampires would flee.  When
Giles finally put together what was happening he decided that it was
best to get back to the house as soon as they could, the vampires
were attacking like that for a reason.  One to try and weaken the
slayer and two to gauge her fighting skills and report back to Vlad
Tepes.  </p>

<p>They were about a quarter of a mile from the house when three
vampires jumped out from some nearby bushes and instantly converged
on the slayer.  Giles aimed his crossbow but couldn't get a clean
shot without risking hitting Buffy.   Buffy did a side kick
knocking
one vamp back and blocked a powerful right swing from the second
one.  The third one grabbed her from behind and Wesley went to fire
his super soaker at the vamp only to discover he was out of holy
water.  Buffy kicked the second vamp in the face knocking him down as
the first vamp was getting back up.  She then elbowed the third vamp
in the lower ribs breaking his grip.  She grabbed the third vamp by
the head and flipped him to the ground staking him as soon as he
hit.  That's when she felt the foot of the first vamp connect with
her jaw knocking her flat on the back.  As the vamp leaped on top of
her she produced Mr. Pointy, and when he landed the vamp impaled
himself on her stake and turned to ashes.  She then flipped back up
and barely managed to side step the remaining vampires charge.  As
the vamp spun around after having run passed her he was greeted with
Mr. Pointy to the heart.  The three of them then left the area and
continued back towards Giles house.  After they were gone a vampire
who had been hiding the whole time emerged from the bushes and rushed
back towards the mansion to report what he had seen to his
master.</p>
