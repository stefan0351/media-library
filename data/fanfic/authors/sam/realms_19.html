<!-- Realms \ Part 18 -->

<p>Giles stood in the hall off the slayers in awe, all around him hand
painted on the murals was the history of the slayers, from the first
slayer all the way up to Buffy and Faith, they where all there.  He
watched as two of the castle artist worked on the portrait of Faith,
carefully painting in Tara by her side.  He would have been happy to
stand there lost in history but an unknown voice brought the watcher
back down to reality.</p>

<p>"Look carefully at what you are seeing watcher and head it well for
all of them are warriors of Gods and Goddesses who stand between
humanity and the demon realm," said a young woman wearing the cloths
of a mage.  Beside her was another woman who was dressed in leather
and armed with a sword. </p>

<p>The woman dressed in leather walked over to towards Giles and
Fey, "Hear her words well watcher.  The things that you see and hear
here today will forever change your life, but forgive us for our lack
of manner in not introducing ourselves, for we seldom get visitors
here.  I am Alexandria and this is my beloved Sabryn."</p>

<p>Giles was overcome by shock at the young women's words and sat down
in the chair closest to him, "Alexandria and Sabryn?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Replied Alexandria</p>

<p>"You're the keeper of the slayers and this is the hall of the
slayers," stammered Giles as where he was began to sink in.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that."</p>

<p>Fey left Giles side and walked over towards the two immortals.  She
looked at the watcher and smiled, "If I didn't know better I would
say he is about to go in shock."</p>

<p>Alexandria let out a hearty laugh, "It will pass, just give his mind
time to adjust to what is happening, after even though the watchers
are well versed in the book knowledge of this place and the story of
myself and Sabryn, until now none of them had seen this place or met
us.  It is understandable that he would be for a loss of words."</p>

<p>Sabryn and Fey both nodded in agreement at what Alexandria had just
said and the three of them took a seat across from the watcher and
waited for him to regain his senses.</p>

<p>After several minutes Giles had regained his composer enough to
speak,, "There's so much I want to ask about the slayers and how all
this fits together, but I don't know where to begin."</p>

<p>Sabryn stood up from here chair and walked over to the wall where the
artist where working, "throughout the ages many the philosopher has
said that it is best to start in the beginning, however seeing that
we do not have the time to cover the entire history of humanity and
the slayers it would be best to start with that which you know,"
stated the immortal as she pointed first to the picture of Buffy and
Willow, then to the one of Faith and Tara, "let us talk about the
slayers you have so valiantly served watcher."     </p>

<p>Alexandria then got up and joined her beloved by the murals, "tell us
when you look at their pictures and then look at the others what is
it that separates them from the others?"</p>

<p>Giles pondered Alexandria's question for a moment then it dawned on
him, "The others, they are alone in the pictures."</p>

<p>"Yes, and do you know why?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Alexandria paused a moment before continuing and wiped a tear from
her cheek, "It is because the they are the only slayers ever to find
there beloved.  All the others you see here fought the good fight
with courage and honor but did so without knowing the joy of true
love. They lived and died in the heat of battle, and that was all
they knew, such is the tragedy of the slayers."</p>

<p>Giles began to sob as the immortals worlds sunk home, their where so
many slayers shown on the walls, each of them a young girl called to
a higher destiny just like his two slayers, but none of them finding
love in their short lives.  Giles struggled to swallow back the tears
for the other slayers that was overcoming him, "It's not right, they
shouldn't have had to live like that."</p>

<p>"You are correct watcher, but sadly the nature of their calling for
the most part is a cruel fate, you are justified in weeping for the
other slayer. But I must remind you that things are different with
both of the slayers that have been entrusted in your care.  You
should rejoice for now both of them have overcome that that harsh
fate and know the love of another."</p>

<p>Sabryn wrapped her arm around Alexandria`s shoulder and softly spoke
to Giles, "Take this to heart watcher, because these two slayers have
managed to overcome the cruel fate of the slayers and found their
beloved's the nature of what it is to be a slayer has changed, if all
goes well there will be no more murals of young warriors standing
alone panted upon these walls."</p>

<p>Giles got up from his seat and looked at the murals of His
slayers, "They are changing that."</p>

<p>"Yes but not as much as you will watcher," replied Alexandria.</p>

<p>A look of puzzlement filled Giles face, "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"We wish you to be our emissary to the council.  You would guide them
on how to care for the slayers, show them that if they wish to fight
a good battle against the darkness that they first must cast aside
all their idiotic beliefs and test and love the slayers as if they
were their own daughters just as you have done.  You will instruct
them that not only are they to support their slayers in this manner
but to help them in the quest to find their soul mates."</p>

<p>"They won't listen to me."</p>

<p>"If you where just a watcher that would be correct, but as our
emissary they will have no choice but to follow your instruction, for
they are still held accountable to our house."</p>

<p>"I think I understand what you're saying."</p>

<p>Alexandria smiled at Giles and motioned for him to sit back
down, "Good for now that is all that is required of you."</p>

<p>Giles took his seat and waited for the others to do the same, "I have
some more questions for you."</p>

<p>"You wish to know what is happening to your slayers."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"They share the same lineage as all slayers do, but both of them have
a destiny far greater than any of their sisters past."</p>

<p>Sabryn picked up the conversation as soon as Alexandria paused, "One
has already started to achieve her destiny by becoming the ultimate
slayer and the others destiny is just beginning to unfold, but the
nature of that destiny is one that will not be revealed until she is
ready to accept it." </p>

<p>Giles was getting ready to put another question on the table when one
of the healers walked into the hall, "We are done."</p>

<p>Fey stood up and walked over to the healer with the others right
behind her, "How are they."</p>

<p>"They are well, the transfusion went well, all of them will have a
full recovery."</p>

<p>"Can I see them now," impatiently interrupted Giles.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you must keep it short, they need their rest."</p>

<p>Everyone stood around the two beds in the healing room.  Tara
snuggled up next to Faith and was placing tender kisses on the
weakened slayers forehead.  Buffy and Willow where cuddled up next to
one another two tired really do anything but take comfort in the fact
that the other was going to be fine.  As Giles watched the four of
them he felt a wave of relief come over him, for now his daughters
were safe.</p>

<p>Fey walked over to where the chair at the foot of the two bed where
Giles had sat down and tapped the watcher on the shoulder, "You must
now return to outer earth and let the others know that all of you are
fine.  The for of them will spend the night here and be returned to
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Can't they come back now," pleaded Giles.</p>

<p>"No they are to weak to travel, plus the magic of this Realm will
enhanced their recovery.  By morning they will be back up to power,
besides the four of them have some visions that are easier shared
with them when they are in the Ethereal.  So return to your friends
and loved ones and take heart in the fact that they are safe and will
be returning to you shortly."</p>

<p>After Fey had finished speaking the room seemed to start to spin
around the watcher as everything became Blurry.  When it cleared up
he found that he was no longer in the Middle Ethereal but on his
front porch and alone.  He reached in his jacket pocket and produced
a house key, and started to chuckle.  After all they have been
through tonight all he could think of was how he was going to explain
what had happened to Joyce.</p>

<p>Within the Dream World...</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow walked hand in hand through a vast garden.  It was
filled with every kind of plant imaginable and some that where beyond
imagination.  Throughout the Garden there was magnificent sculptures
that would rival those of the Roman Empire.  As they walked through
the garden they found them selves drawn to a large fountain in its
center.  The fountain was made of marble and had a statue of them
along with Faith and Tara as it's center piece.  Sitting on the bench
next to it where Tara and Faith who also seemed drawn to this
fountain.</p>

<p>"Hey how did you guys get here," Questioned Buffy.</p>

<p>""Not sure B, last thing I remember was falling a sleep next to Tara
and presto we found ourselves here."</p>

<p>"So do either of you know where here is?"</p>

<p>Tara ran her hand through Faiths hair as she stood up, "We are in the
warriors garden just outside Alexandria's castle."</p>

<p>"How'd you know that," questioned Willow.</p>

<p>"My Mom and Fey used to bring me here a lot before I was sent to
outer Earth, though I don't recall ever seeing this fountain before."</p>

<p>"That's because it hasn't been built yet child," replied Fey as she
rounded the corner.</p>

<p>The four young Women spun around and stared blankly at Fey for a
moment.  "What do you mean it hasn't been built yet," demanded Faith.</p>

<p>Fey grinned at Faith, "You are definitely as spirited one to say the
least," she then motioned towards the benches that surrounded the
fountain, "Come sit with me and I will answer your question and tell
you why the four of you have been brought here."</p>

<p>Fey waited for the four of them to take their seats and
continued, "It hasn't been built yet because the four of you are in
the dream world, what you are looking at is the Warriors garden of
the future.  This fountain is the heart of the garden because and
represents the greatest of the slayers and their soulmates." </p>

<p>Willow looked dircely at Fey, "Why have we been brought here."</p>

<p>"I thought it would be nice for you to see this place, the four of
you are just now starting to embark on the path that will lead to
this fountain being built in your honor, but before you go down that
path there are some things that you must know first."</p>

<p>"Like what," quipped Buffy.</p>

<p>"Yeah what," added Faith.</p>

<p>"For starters is anyone interested in knowing why Willow fell when
Buffy did."</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow both looked at one another and pondered the question
that had just been put to them.  After a brief moment the two of them
turned their attention back to Fey and shook their heads yes.</p>

<p>"When the two of you declared your love for one another and Buffy
awoke as the ultimate slayer the powers to be in their wisdom bonded
you to one another, so what happens to one of you is felt by the
other.  Your beloved fell with you slayer because the nature of that
bond created will not allow one to exist with out the other."</p>

<p>"Wait a second your saying that if I would for some reason get taken
out in a fight or heaven forbid something would happen to Willow the
other one of us would..."</p>

<p>"Also perish, it is the what that it has to be, the two of you have
been blessed with great power, together you are a near unstoppable
force against the darkness, but with great power comes great cost.
You see child when one is dealing with the powers that be everything
is about balance, it is the only way the universe can survive."</p>

<p>"OK, I'm just a little bit confused here, please explain that to me
in English," snapped a rather frustrated Buffy.</p>

<p>"Buffy you are now the most powerful slayer ever to walk the earth,
but you are quick to react and often leap before you think things
through.  Willow who is rapidly becoming a powerful mage is the
opposite, she is cautious and tries to plan things through to the
finest detail, a lot of times to her own hindrance.  However together
the two of you balance one another, and that is a balance that must
be maintained at all cost."</p>

<p>"But why if something should happen to one of us does it need to
happen to the other."</p>

<p>"It is to maintain the balance, besides the two of you shouldn't fret
over this, I foresee you sharing a long and prosperous life together."</p>

<p>"Buffy smiled when she heard Fey's reassuring words.  The blonde
slayer wrapped her arms around Willow and placed a tender kiss on the
redhead's lips, "I think I could live with that."</p>

<p>"Me to," added Willow just before returning Buffy's kiss.</p>

<p>"W-what about us," nervously asked Tara.</p>

<p>"Child the two of you also have a destiny together but it is a very
different path than the one that your friends are embarking on."</p>

<p>"What is it."</p>

<p>Fey walked over next to Faith and Tara and put a hand on each of the
girls shoulder, "It is not yet time, before the destiny the two of
you have ahead of you can be revealed there is a battle to be fought."</p>

<p>Faith tightened her grip on Tara's hand, "Ciarán."</p>

<p>"Correct child, the time has come for the four of you to face and
banish the warlock, and I shall show you how to do it."</p>
