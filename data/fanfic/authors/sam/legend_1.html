<!-- Legend \ Prelude -->

<p>Once in the distant past they had been called upir, then Vampyre, and
finally vampire.  They were the spawn of hell and roamed the lands of
eastern Europe, filling the hearts of its inhabitants with terror.
As there number grew they began to spread throughout the rest of
Europe and beyond.  The powers of light feared that this dark force
might eventually overrun the world so they combined there powers to
create a champion brining into creation the fist slayer.  They then
appointed a group of scholars and Shaman to watch after the champion
and to aid in the fight against the darkness, that is how watchers
came into being.   Then came the great one, the Master of the
Vampyre.  Every slayer that sought him perished at his hands, and
soon the other vampyre began to worship him.  The elder watchers
fearing that he would eventually destroy all the slayers formed a
council to govern over the other watchers and the slayers.  They sat
down rules and rituals that they thought would help in defeating this
powerful foe.  All their efforts were in vain and He continued his
rampage until one night he vanished.  The watchers throughout the
known world were sent out in search of ant sign of him but they could
find no, so they returned to their homes and went about their daily
business and silently prayed that He would never return.</p>
