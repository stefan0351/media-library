<!-- Legend \ Chapter 5: House Dracul -->

<p>A week had passed since the vampires had swept through the Sunnydale
campus killing the commandos, and now there was nothing but silence.
The reign of terror had suddenly stopped.  Buffy and Angel hadn't
even come accrosed a single vamp on their patrol for that last six
days, which made Willow both happy but at the same time she was all
the more worried about her new lover.  If the vamps were not out and
about that met that Buffy wouldn't have to fight them, risking
injury or worse.  However she also realized that with the recent
events that this was most likely a calm before the storm, so she did
what she had been doing every night while Buffy was out,  She paced
in their room saying a silent prayer to the Goddess for Buffy`s
safe return.</p>

<p>Xander and Anya had just been dropped off at his place and he was
searching through his jeans for the house key, when a figure stepped
around the corner of the house.</p>

<p>"Do you remember what I said I would do to you when I was my old
self again" Spike said as he stepped up onto the porch and began
walking towards the two of them with two other vampires in tow.</p>

<p>Xander protectively stepped between Spike and Anya as she struggled
to get the door open.  Spike took a swing at Xander which he managed
to block only to get sent flying off the porch into the yard by a
second punch he never saw coming.  Spike then stepped off the porch
and made his way over to Xander, kicking him in the chest as he was
getting up off of the ground.  He then grabbed Xander by the collar
lifting him up so they were face to face.  "It's payback
time" Said the blond vampire before He threw the boy accrosed the
yard.</p>

<p>Anya was helpless, the two vampires that had followed Spike onto the
porch immediately had grabbed her when Spike began his assault on
Xander.  They weren't doing anything to her just holding her so
she couldn't get away as Spike thrashed her boyfriend. </p>

<p>Buffy had just arrived back at their room to find Willow wasn't
there, she was starting to panic when she saw a note from Willow
saying that her computer had crashed and she was using the one in the
lounge.  Buffy started to walk down the hallway towards the student
lounge on their floor when she heard a scream.  She broke into a full
sprint rushing down the hallway the instant she heard the plea for
help, the voice she had heard was defiantly Willows.</p>

<p>Buffy burst through the door and into the student lounge, Willow was
trapped in the far corner of the room by Riley and another
vampire.  "GET AWAY FROM HER!" shouted the slayer at the top
of her lungs as she charged the vampire closest to her.  The vamp had
spun around just to see the slayers fist connect with his face.
Buffy followed up with a quick leg sweep, and staked him with Mr.
Pointy before he even hit the ground.  She then turned all her
attention to Riley.  He slowly stepped away from the corner that
Willow was cowering in, cautiously eyeing the slayer.  </p>

<p>"How dare you even think of hurting my Willow," Buffy snapped
at Riley as she connected with a solid kick to his chest sending him
flying into a wall.  As he bounced off of the wall she connected with
a knee to the abdomen causing the vampire to bend over.  She the
connected with a kick to the head, then a round house , laying him
flat on his back on the lounge floor.  Before the vampire Riley could
get up the slayer came down on top of his chest with a elbow drop.
Buffy then began to repeatedly strike him in the face with all her
strength shouting , "No body messes with My Willow," with
each punch. After about twenty or so punches she produced Mr. Point
and rammed it into Riley reducing him to ashes.  </p>

<p>Buffy jumped up and ran over to Willow.  Kneeling down beside the
redhead she quickly examined her to ensure the vampires had not
harmed her.  The slayer then took her lover in her arms and pulled
her up against her as they sat cuddling in the corner of the lounge.</p>

<p>"Are you alright" Asked Buffy as she slowly rocked back and
forth with Willow in her arms.</p>

<p>"I'm fine now" Replied Willow as she placed her head on
the slayers shoulder.</p>

<p>Xander Woke up finding himself laying face down in the yard, every
muscle in his body ached and it took everything he had just to stand
up, but as soon as he got to his feet a sharp pain shot through his
left leg and he immediately fell back to the ground in agony
clutching his leg.   He looked to the porch to see the door was still
shut and that Anya was missing, a wave of dread swept over him, <what
had they done with Her.>  He began to pull himself along the ground
slowly etching his way towards the porch, ignoring the pain that was
racing through his body, his mind was focused on one thing, Anya.</p>

<p>Angel was about five blocks from Giles house when ten vampires lead
by Spike stepped out in front of him from an Alley.  Spike looked
Angel dead in the eyes, "I have someone to introduce you to soul
boy" </p>

<p>"Yeah, and who might that be," Inquired Angel as he tried to
gauge his situation.</p>

<p> "Angel meet Vlad Tepes Dracul,"  As Spike finished his
sentence the vampires behind him parted in the middle and the blonde
vamp stepped off to the side.  Angel was now standing face to face
with the Master Vampyre.</p>

<p>Vlad looked directly into Angel's eyes, "By the time I am done
with you, you will wish that you had remained in hell"</p>
