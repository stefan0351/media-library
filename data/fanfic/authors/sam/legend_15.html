<!-- Legend \ Chapter 14: Bladesinger -->

<p>They all had taken their seats in the hotel room, all
eyes were locked on Eamonn as he stood in the middle
of the room, looking at Willow and Buffy, "I am
Eamonn,. a Druid high priest in the service of the
Goddess. The beloved Goddess has sent me here for two
reasons." Eamonn looked directly at Willow then
continued, "I have been sent to instruct you on how to
use your minds eye to developed and perfect your
magic," he then looked at Buffy, "Also I am to help
you discover your true nature."</p>

<p>Willow looked at him after he had spoken, "You said
you were a Druid, but there haven't been druids around
for a long time. How can that be?"</p>

<p>"Eleven hundred years ago I was taken into the forever
by the Goddess just as you were young Wiccan. However
I remained in the forever until just a few years ago
when the two of you first met one another. At that
time the Goddess returned me to the earth to await the
your calling."</p>

<p>"Eleven hundred years , are you immortal?"</p>

<p>"No I am of the same flesh and blood as you, the
reason for my appearance and long life is quite
simple, one does not age in the forever. However once
I was returned to the earth I once again began to age
just like most of you," replied Eamonn as he gave
Angel a quick glance.</p>

<p>Before Willow could ask him another question Buffy
looked Eamonn dead in the eye and spoke, "You said
that one of the reasons you were here was to help find
my true nature, what is that suppose to mean.."</p>

<p>"You are not what you appear to be," Eamonn turned
away from the girls and looked at Giles and the other
watchers, "Have any of you ever wondered why she has
outlasted any other slayer, or why she needed very
little training when called?"</p>

<p>The four men looked at one another as they thought
about the question Eamonn had just placed before them,
Giles looked over at Buffy and Willow, then turned to
Eamonn, "I believe she is the slayer that is to close
the Hellsmouths."</p>

<p>"That is her destiny however a slayer is not capable
of permeably closing a Hellsmouth."</p>

<p>Buffy jumped out of her chair barely managing not to
drop Willow, who just a second ago had been sitting in
her lap. She put the redhead down back in to the
chair and walked over to Eamonn, "What in the world
are you talking about, are you trying to say that I am
not the chosen one?"</p>

<p>As Eamonn started to speak everyone in the room was
glued to his every word, "You are the Chosen one, but
not a slayer."
Buffy cut Eamonn off before he could finish, "What is
that supposed to mean. How can I be the chosen one
but not a slayer, its not possible." </p>

<p>"No not only is it possible it is the reality of what
you are," Replied Eamonn. "The powers of light are
the source of the slayer and the Goddess herself
oversees them. In her infinite wisdom the Goddess saw
that the slayers did not possess the necessary skills
to permanently seal the Hellsmouths so when the time
came for you to be called it was the Goddess who
called you, not the powers of light." Eamonn walked
over to Buffy and put his hand on her shoulder, "Make
no mistake you were called as the chosen one. However
unlike all others before you your power does not come
from the powers of light but from the Goddess herself,
You child are her warrior, You are the Bladesinger.".</p>

<p>Buffy turned away from Eamonn as she tried to take in
what he was saying. She all the sudden found herself
doubting everything she knew, since the age of 15 she
had been told she was the slayer. Her calling had
taken away her innocence and cost her the life she
once had. Being the slayer had become her identity,
and now that was gone. She walked back towards
Willow, as she did her lover got up out of the chair
and walked towards her. When the two of them met
Willow embraced her beloved,. Buffy turned her head
towards Eamonn as Willow held on to her, "What am I?
What is a Bladesinger?"</p>

<p>"You are the Bladesinger, the chosen warrior picked by
the Goddess to fight against the darkness. That is
all that you need to know for now, we will talk about
this more once I begin the training, however at this
moment everyone needs to rest, when you all awake we
will move this operation to a safer place that I have
prepared, and the training will begin."</p>

<p>Everyone had left to go and get some rest and Cordelia
and Angel found themselves alone in her room. Angel
took her by the hand and looked into Cordelia's eyes,
"What is happening between us."</p>

<p>"I’m not sure but I think I might be falling for you.
When you were captured I didn’t know what was going
to become of you. I felt so lost and alone without
you around, it made me realize that I had feelings for
you that went beyond friendship."</p>

<p>"Lately I have found myself feeling the same way about
you, I think that I love you," Replied Angel</p>

<p>"Where do we go from here?" Asked Cordelia, unsure of
how to take what they had to a new level.</p>

<p>"I’m really not sure, but this would be a nice start,"
after he had finished speaking from his heart, Angel
leaned into her and softly kissed Cordelia on the
lips.</p>

<p>Vlad walked back and forth in front of his newly risen
army, "Soon we will strike and my revenge will be
complete, but first I must allow my children to become
stronger," Vlad paused then walked over to Spike,
"They need to be schooled battle tactics and
techniques so they will not perish as easy as the
others did. For now we will stay close to this area
and prepare for the Witch and the Slayer. I
underestimated them once but that will not happen
again."</p>

<p>"Yes Master"</p>

<p>Turning back towards the undead army Vlad once again
addressed the blonde vampire, "William I have a very
special job for you."</p>

<p>"What do you wish of me"</p>

<p>"I need to know just how powerful the witch is so I
have a gift for the slayer I wish for you to deliver."</p>

<p>"What is it master," asked a very puzzled Spike.</p>

<p>The master vampyre turned around and produced a hand
gun, "I wish to be the one to take her so stop short
of killing the slayer."</p>

<p>Spike smiled as he took the gun from the master
vampyre, &lt;This was going to be very enjoyable&gt;</p>

<p>The walls of the warehouse that Eamonn had taken Angel
to were now lined with several cots, each of them
having a small wooden crate next to it. Eamonn looked
at them as they stood in the middle of the room, "I
know that it is not much but for the last several days
I have been placing very powerful protection spells on
this building. It is most likely the safest place
around the Hellsmouth, so please find a place to rest
and get settled in for there is much to do and very
little time to do it in."</p>

<p>Eamonn then walked over to Buffy and Willow, "I have
prepared a place for the two of you in the office
upstairs," replied Eamonn as he pointed towards a set
of metal stairs.</p>

<p>Buffy looked up at the office at the top of the
stairs then at Eamonn, "Why do we get our own room
when everyone else including yourself has to share
this open area," she inquired, wondering why they were
getting special treatment.</p>

<p>"It is for your comfort and privacy. You are the
Bladesinger and she is your champion. For me to even
think of asking the two of you to give up such things
would be unforgivable."</p>

<p>The room had a twin size bed in it and there was a
small cabinet for them to put their belongings in. A
thick curtain covered the window that overlooked the
main area were the others were. The walls were
covered in Sigil’s and there was a circle drawn on the
floor next to there bed. The night stand had several
different kinds of candles sitting on top of it and
there were several very old books laying on a crate
in the corner of the room. Willow went over to the
crate and began looking the books over, "Buffy these
are amazing"</p>

<p>Buffy walked up behind Willow and wrapped her arms
around the redheads waste, she then stood on her tip
toes looking over Willows shoulder, "What are they"</p>

<p>"They're spell books from all over the world," replied
Willow as she continued to look through the ancient
books.</p>

<p>Eamonn watched as the two girls walked down the stairs
from their room, once they had reached the bottom of
the stairs he looked at them, "Come over here please,
it is time to begin your training."</p>

<p>When Buffy and Willow reached Eamonn he picked up a
long sword in a golden sheath and handed it to Buffy,
"This sword is just like any other sword. It has no
magical properties whatsoever, but in your hands it
will come to life. The power that lies within you
will make it sing your bladesong."</p>

<p>Eamonn held the long sword out to Buffy and she pulled
it from the Sheath, "It’s not doing anything"</p>

<p>"You must concentrate on the blade, close your eyes
and see it with your mind as you hold it in your hand.
You must become one with the blade to make the
bladesong be heard."</p>

<p>Buffy did as Eamonn said, she visualized herself
holding the blade and as she did she could hear the
blade begin to hum a sweet melody. Eamonn walked over
to her and spoke, "now child open your eyes and
release the bladesong that you have created."</p>

<p>Buffy opened up her eyes and looked at the sword she
held in her hands, she could feel the blades melody
pulsate through her body as it sang the bladesong.
She looked at Eamonn in bewilderment, "What is
happening."</p>

<p>"The Bladesinger within you has awaken, now do the
dance of battle," Answered Eamonn smiling as he
pointed to towards the metal body armor he had set up
on the far side of the room. </p>

<p>Buffy sprang into the Acton, quickly closing the gap
between her and the armor mock up. As she attacked
everyone could hear her sweet but deadly bladesong
fill the room. They all sat in amazement as the
melody filled played and Buffy reduced the armor to a
pile of useless metal. Eamonn smiled as he walked
over to her, "Well done Bladesinger, but real
opponents are much harder to defeat than empty armor,
continue to practice your bladesong so that you might
perfect it."</p>

<p>Eamonn then walked over to Willow, "Now child The time
has come for me to show you how to use your minds
eye."</p>

<p>Eamonn took Willows hand and led her over to the
circle. Once there he said a chant opening up the
circle’s magic and the two of them stepped inside.
Eamonn motioned for Willow to take a seat which she
did. The Druid high priest then sat accrosed from
her, "close your eyes child and follow my voice,"
Eamonn waited a few moments to allow Willow to
completely detach herself from their surroundings then
he continued, "Can you her me,"</p>

<p>Willow replied to the formless voice that spoke within
her mind, "Yes, but who are you and where are we."</p>

<p>"I am your guide, we are inside the core of your
mind, now follow my voice and I will lead you to the
minds eye."</p>

<p>Giles and the others sat their in silence as they
watched what was unfolding before them. On the far
side of the room Buffy was practicing with the long
sword, she moved with grace and precision as the
bladesong filled the room, it seemed as if she was in
a strange ballet with the sword.. In the middle of
the room completely unaware of what Buffy was doing
where Eamonn and Willow. It wasn’t the fact that they
seemed removed from the outside world as they sat in
the circle that caused everyone's minds to ponder what
was going on, it was the fact that the two of them
were floating three feet above the circle that did
that. Giles looked over at Collin and the others, "Do
you have any idea what is going on here,"</p>

<p>The council member looked at him, his face showed that
he was just as confused by what they were witnessing
as everyone else, "I am afraid not"</p>

<p>Eamonn voice spoke softly inside Willows mind, "Can
you see your minds eye"</p>

<p>"Yes"</p>

<p>"Focus on it, and see what it sees"</p>

<p>Willow did what Eamonn’s voice had told her to do and
she was amazed. She could see everything around her
without opening her eyes. Everyone in the room seemed
to be surrounded by a soft white light except Eamonn,
Buffy, Giles, Angel and herself. She and Eamonn were
surrounded by a white blue mist, a similar mist
surrounded Giles but it seemed considerably weaker
than hers and Eamonn’s. Angel had no aura at all, and
When she looked at Buffy she didn’t see the soft light
that surrounded the others but a intense light filled
with all the colors of the rainbow, the light that
came from Buffy was so bright she had to turn away
form it in fear that she might be blinded. "What is
happening"</p>

<p>"You are seeing your friends with your minds eye. The
light that surrounds them is their life force"</p>

<p>"What of the blue mist"</p>

<p>"It is the life force of magic, the more powerful the
magic the stronger the mist will be"</p>

<p>"What about Angel"</p>

<p>"He is a vampire, even with a soul his life force is
long gone"</p>

<p>"And what of my beloved, why is her life force so
different"</p>

<p>"She is the Bladesinger, what you see is not only her
life force but the strength and power that the Goddess
gave her when she was called. I would not look at it
to long however, her aura is also a natural weapon of
the Bladesinger , it is meant to blind the minds eye
of anyone who would attempt to use magic against her."</p>

<p>"But I would never harm her"</p>

<p>"I know, but it is a natural defense, she can not
control it and it is always there to shield her from
the minds eye of those who are of magic."</p>

<p>Vlad watched as Spike talked with several of his
children about what they needed to accomplish tonight.
The master vampyre smirked as his mind visualized the
damage that his favorite child was going to do to the
slayer. He was sure the witch would be able to heal
the slayer but how quickly she did would let him know
just how powerful the witch had become, and what he
needed to do to destroy her.</p>

<p>Buffy wore the golden sheath containing her long sword
at her side as she and Willow walked hand in hand
towards the campus on patrol. Eamonn walked on the
other side of Willow as the others closely followed
behind them. Suddenly Buffy stopped and pulled the
sword from it’s sheath, as soon as she did it began
it’s deadly melody. Willow turned to her beloved,
"What’s wrong"</p>

<p>"We have company," replied the Buffy.</p>

<p>Ten vampires came out of an ally to their right as
another ten came from behind some hedges to their
left. In front of them were twenty vampires led by
Spike. Giles and Archer took aim with their
crossbows as Xander pointed a super soaker at Spike
and Kathryn and Tristin both took fighting positions
as they produced stakes .</p>

<p>Spike stood there watching the group preparing to
defend itself, he was temporally memorized by the
melody that seemed to come from the slayers sword. It
cut into his very being and his inner voice cried out
to him to get out and get back to the master. He was
about ready to flee when he recalled why he had been
sent, He had a job to do for the master.</p>

<p>Buffy stood there wondering what was going on, the
vampires were not attacking, or even showing any signs
that they planned on attacking. She was just about to
spring into action when spike spoke and got her
attention.</p>

<p>"I come with a message from the master," replied the
blonde vampire as he reached into his coat.</p>

<p>What," Buffy shouted at him pointing the sword at him,
as it sang her bladesong.</p>

<p>Spike found that it took everything he had to pull the
gun out from underneath his jacket as the melody of
the Bladesong filled his mind. He also notices that
the other vampires were slowly backing up from the
group, trying to get as far away as possible from the
slayer and the sword she held in her hand. He took
aim at Buffy and yelled, "This is the message," as he
opened fire on the slayer.</p>

<p>Willow screamed as she saw Buffy hit the ground. The
redhead immediately dropped to her knees next to her
fallen love and took the blonde in her arms as tears
rolled down her cheek. Giles and Archer let go with
the crossbows and took about two vampires as they were
running away. Eamonn said a quick chant that burst
eleven of the retreating vampires into flames, then
knelt down next to the two girls. The rest of the
group quickly surveyed the area and saw that Spike and
the rest of the vampires had safety escaped after he
had shot Buffy. Giles and Xander then quickly rushed
over to their fallen friends side with the others
right behind them.</p>

<p>Willow looked as her beloved laid in her arms
bleeding. She could her the bladesong coming from the
sword begin to weaken as Buffy started to fade into
unconsciousness. She saw that Buffy had been hit
several times and was rapidly losing blood, she
looked at Eamonn as tears freely flowed down her face,
and pleaded with the druid high priest, "She’s dying,
how can I save her." </p>

<p>Eamonn softly spoke to Willow, "Do as you did before
when you healed her but this time use your minds eye
to see what it is use wish to do."</p>

<p>Willow placed her hand upon Buffy’s chest and closed
her eyes. As soon as she did a golden mist surrounded
the blond and the bullets from Spikes gun rose out off
her body. The wounds that they had made closed behind
them. Willow then looked deeper into herself with her
minds eye and healed the internal damage that Spike
had done. She opened her eyes and looked down at
Buffy when she heard the bladesong start up again.
Her beloved was now healed, she reached out with her
hand and helped Buffy to her feet. </p>

<p>"Thanks Wills, I guess I owe you another one" Buffy
said as she wrapped her arms around Willow.</p>

<p>"Well after tonight I know how you can repay me,"
replied a very serous Willow</p>

<p>"How" Smiled Buffy hoping she Willows answer was what
she was thinking of.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow we get you some body armor" </p>

<p>Buffy looked at Willow and saw that she had her
resolve face on, "It’s as good as done," replied
Buffy. Willows answer was not the one she had hoped
for, but that didn’t bother her much. She knew Willow
only wanted her to be safe and besides she figured
Willow should get double repayment on this one.</p>

<p>Buffy placed the sword back into its sheath and took
Willows hand in her own, "I think that is about enough
for tonight, how about you"</p>

<p>"Yeah, let’s call it a night"</p>

<p>The two of them then walked past the others as they
headed back towards the warehouse. Giles looked at
Eamonn, "What now."</p>

<p>"The Bladesinger and her champion have made their
decision, I suggest that we return with them."</p>

<p>After they had departed Vlad stepped out from the
shadows, clenching his fist he screamed into the night
over what he had seen. Not only was the traitor with
them but he had been completely healed. To make
matters worse The witch was extremely powerful but the
slayer appeared to be more powerful than any slayer he
had ever seen. What had that strange man called him
her, a Bladesinger. Vlad didn’t know what it men but
he knew that it threw an unexpected twist into his
revenge, he would have to re-think how he was going to
destroy the two of them. He then walked of towards
his lair trying to get the haunting melody of the
bladesong out of his head.</p>
