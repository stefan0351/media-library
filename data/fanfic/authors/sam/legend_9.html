<!-- Legend \ Chapter 8: Dark storm rising -->

<p>They had spent the majority of the day talking about
Cordelia’s vision from The Powers That Be and the
voice that Willow had heard in her sleep, they tried
to piece the meanings of these messages together,
only to realize just how cryptic The Powers That Be
are.  One thing however was for certain, they knew
that they had little time to learn what the messages
met, They knew that when night fell it would bring the
Master Vampyre and his children of the night.  </p>

<p>Giles paced the room, “Vlad Tepes power is rumored to
come from the darkness that cloaked his soul in life
but how can we use that against him?”  The rest of the
group looked at the watcher as he spoke and shook
their heads, no one knew the answer to the question
that was plaguing them all.</p>

<p>Angel howled out in pain as Vlad ran a hot poker
accrosed his cheek, “So traitor do you still wish to
die”</p>

<p>A greatly weakened Angel was barely able to responded
to his tormentor, “Yes,” he sobbed.</p>

<p>“To bad, I am enjoying myself way to much,” replied
Vlad with a huge grin on his face and then made
another pass with the hot poker as Spike walked into
the room.</p>

<p>“Master, what is on our agenda for tonight,” replied
the Blonde vamp, eager for some action.</p>

<p>“Tonight William, we get me the Witch”</p>

<p>It now was just a few short hours till the sunset
came, Giles and Wesley were talking to Quentin
developing two game plans; one for if their help got
here before night fall and another if they didn’t.
Megan sat in a chair next to Cordelia trying to help
her interpret the vision she had had but so far she
had not gotten any further than the rest of the group
why did The Powers That Be have to be so cryptic she
thought to herself.  As all of this happened Buffy
laid on the couch her head resting on Willows lap as
the redhead reassured her they would find a way to
defeat Vlad</p>

<p>The doorbell rang and Giles got up and went to answer
it.  When he did all he could say was, “Thank the Gods
your here,”  The other Watchers and the Slayers in
training had made it and with very little time to
spare, the sun had begun to sink into the west.  The
group from England was quickly briefed on the
situation and given the plan of attack for tonight.
There was going to be two patrols, one for each side
of town.  Buffy would lead one patrol with Giles, four
other watchers and two of the slayers in training.
Wesley was going to be in charge of the second  one
that was made up of the remaining six watchers and
four slayers in training.</p>

<p>Vlad looked out the window to the darkness that now
filled the night , He took a broad sword and rammed it
through Angels abdomen so hard that it embedded itself
into the concrete wall behind the traitor as he cried
out in agony.  Vlad then walked over to Spike and the
fifty other vampires that now filled the room, “Shall
we begin”</p>

<p> Wesley’s  team turned into a cemetery that was about
a mile from Giles house, So far so good thought the
council member as they made their way into the heart
of the cemetery.  They had been out a half hour and
had seen no signs of vampires, but that did little to
ease the tension that filled their being.  They knew
that the enemy was coming, they just didn’t know when.</p>

<p>Then it happened, ten vampires popped up from behind
the tombstones they had been hiding behind, and
another twenty came from the mausoleum to the groups
left.  The Slayers in training all produced stakes and
took up fighting stances, as the watchers came out
with crossbows.  Then a figure stepped out of the
darkness.  He wore all black except for a golden seal
on his chest that bore the image of a dragon, “Allow
me to introduce myself, I am Vlad Tepes Dracul”</p>

<p>One of the watchers fired a stake at the master
Vampyre only to have Vlad pick it out of the air, “Now
that was a very foolish thing to do.  Kill them,”
snared Vlad.</p>

<p>The vampires rushed the group as the other watchers
let go with their crossbows, unfortunately none of
them were as good as a shot as Giles, only four
managed to hit their intended targets before the
vampires were upon them.  A vampire grabbed one of the
watchers as he tried to reload his crossbow and
snapped his neck.  He then turned his attention to
another watcher who managed to get a shot off only to
have it hit the vamp in the shoulder barely missing
its mark.  The vampire yanked the stake out from his
shoulder and rammed it with all of his strength
through the watchers heart dropping him to the ground.</p>

<p>One of the slayers in training had just staked a
vampire and turned to fight a second only to find
herself face to face with Vlad.  He grabbed her by the
throat lifting her up off of the ground.  The slayer
in training’s body began to shake as the master
vampyre tightened his grip.  Another slayer in
training who saw what was happening broke from the
vampire she was fighting and rushed to help the other
girl.  Vlad caught her in with his other hand and
lifted her up into the air by the throat and began to
strangle both the slayers in training.  On of the
watchers seeing that Vlad literally had both of his
hands full took aim with his crossbow, just as he
fired a vampire leapt in front of his master
sacrificing himself.</p>

<p>Buffy sailed through the air landing in front of a
vampire that was getting ready to finish of a badly
wounded slayer in training.  The vamp took a swing at
her but she caught his arm and flipped him to the
ground.  She then produced Mr. Pointy and dusted her
foe.  Another vamp jumped her from behind only to be
kicked in the back by a slayer in training named
Kathryn.  The enraged vamped spun around to attack the
girl and as he did Buffy staked him from behind.
Three more vampires converged on the two girls taking
caution in approaching them  Giles took aim with his
crossbow and took out on of the vamps then turned his
attention to helping the two remaining watchers in the
group as the y tried to fend off four vampires.</p>

<p>Vlad grabbed a slayer in training off the top of one
of his children as she was preparing to stake him, and
snapped her spine like it was a twig.  He then ripped
a crossbow from a nearby watchers arm and broke it in
half, then proceeded to feed off of him while his
children encircled Wesley who now found himself very
much alone against ten vampires.  </p>

<p>Buffy stood there looking at the others, the twenty
vamps that had attacked them were gone but only Giles,
Kathryn, a badly wounded slayer in training named
Tristin, and herself remained.  She looked over to
Giles, “Now what do we do,” she asked in desperation.</p>

<p>“I think it’s time to go find the other group and head
back to the house”, replied the watcher.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door, and Quentin went to
answer it.  As he opened the door he saw Wesley laying
on the porch not moving , and without thinking he
rushed outside to help the young council member.  He
knelt down and felt for a pulse but could not find
any.  As Quentin turned back into the house to let
them know he was dead Megan screamed in horror.  The
older council member spun around only to come face to
face with a vamped out Wesley.  The former council
member grabbed him and threw him to the ground  as
Vlad and Spike walked onto the porch leaving seven
other vampires in Giles front yard.  Vlad grabbed
Quentin by the back of the neck and lifted him up,
“Send out the witch and I will allow you all to live
for now.”</p>

<p>Quentin managed to gather inner strength that he
didn’t even know he had, “Were not turning anyone over
to you”</p>

<p>Vlad looked into the house and saw Willow standing
there, trembling from the fear that he had come for
her.  The master Vampyre smiled at her and it sent a
cold shiver down the redheads spine.  He then looked
at Megan and Cordelia before he turned his eyes to the
man that was now within his grasp, “So be it,” Vlad
said as he nodded to Spike.  The blonde vamp then
produced a Molotov cocktail, set it ablaze, then
tossed it through the open door, as Vlad sunk his
teeth into Quentin draining every last drop of blood
from his body, then laughing like a madman as he
dropped his cold victim to the ground.</p>

<p>Buffy and her group had searched the area Wesley was
suppose to be patrolling only to discover that they
had been wiped out and that Wesley was missing.  A
sense of dread over came Buffy and panic filled her
face.  “I have got to get to Willow”  Shouted Buffy as
she took off into the night, leaving Giles and the
others behind.</p>

<p>The three women rushed to the back off the house as
the living room burst into flames.  They made it to
the back door only to find ten vampires waiting there
for them.  One of the vamps threw a blazing Molotov
cocktail into the kitchen as the girls retreated out
of the room.  They were in sheer panic, both the exits
were blocked by vampires and the fire from the
vampires Molotov cocktails was rapidly spreading
through the house.  They did the only thing they could
and rushed down stairs to the basement.  Once they got
there Willow opened the metal door to the storage room
and the three of them rushed inside, locking the door
behind them.  Willow then sat down on the cold
concrete floor and began to chant.</p>

<p>“Beloved Goddess of the silver moon!<br>
Mistress of mysteries-Queen of the sea!<br>
I call upon thee in ancient names-<br>
Artemis, Cerridwenn, Hecate!</p>

<p>Beloved sister of the hidden wood!<br>
Child enchantress-Star of the night!<br>
I call upon thee of the untamed wilds-<br>
Descend with your laughter and secret delight!</p>

<p>Beloved Mother of the ageless womb,<br>
From which the many worlds, at once, were born!<br>
I call upon thee of the gentle Earth-<br>
From whose breast, and whose belly our bounty is<br>
shorn!</p>

<p>Beloved wisewoman, spinner of fates!<br>
Weaver of dreamwebs-bearer of death!<br>
I call upon thee of the waning skies-<br>
Grant me your vision and open my eyes!</p>

<p>Goddess I ask thee to live within me!<br>
Grant me your knowing, and show me to see!<br>
Lend me your wisdom and love for all things;<br>
Goddess of magick, I call unto thee!</p>

<p>Artemis, Cerridwenn, Hecate!<br>
Artemis, Cerridwenn, Hecate!”</p>

<p>Buffy could see the flames off in the distance and she
began to run even faster towards the house, every
fiber of her being  told her that Willow was in danger
and that she had to get to her as fast as she could.
The slayer was running with all of her might when
seven vampires rushed out onto the road in front of
her blocking the way.  “I don’t have time for this,”
shouted the slayer as she produced Mr. Point and
attacked the vampires.</p>

<p>Anya had managed to finally pick the lock to the cage
that had become her prison.  Quietly she crawled out
of it and made her way to were Angel was being held.
She slowly peeked around the corner to see four
vampires sitting at a table and another two laying out
several ice picks on a table that was next to Angel.
She had to cover her mouth to keep from gasping in
horror when she saw the brooding vamp.  His body was
covered with slashes, stab wounds, and severe burns.
A large sword had been driven through his abdomen were
it still remained and they had placed a crown of
thorns on his head that was piercing into his scull.
She knew that there was no way she could save him,
Vlad had left to many vampires there to stand guard.
Silently she made her way back into the other room and
crept towards the back door, as soon as she got there
she burst through it an began running towards Giles as
fast as her legs could carry her, screaming out in
terror the whole way.</p>

<p>Buffy fought as she had never fought before, her mind
was focused on one thing, finishing off the vamps and
getting to Willow.  The slayer used every skill she
could call upon and fought with a fury her attackers
had never seen before, the blonde rammed Mr. Pointy
into the heart of one vamp, then caught another with a
left hook sending him reeling backwards.  She then did
a round house knocking a third vamp to the ground,
following up with Mr. Pointy she reduced him to dust.
Two other vamps went to attack her from behind, but
she stayed low to the ground as she spun around and
knocked their legs out from beneath them.  The slayer
then staked one of the vamp and kicked the other in
the ribs as he tried to get back up.  A vamp grabbed
her from behind, only to have the slayer kick her leg
backwards and nail him in the groin.  She then kicked
the vamp that was once again trying to get back up in
the head knocking him back to the ground, before she
spun around and staked the moaning vamp behind here.
She then turned around and staked the vamp on the
ground before he could even try to get up again. The
remaining two vamps looked at her then charged.</p>

<p>Vlad told his children to go and make sure no one
could get in the area for a few more minutes then He
and Spike made there way through the smoldering
remains of the house.  They quickly  and headed down
the burnt out stairs that lead to the basement, an
evil grin filled Vlad’s face, his plan was coming
together and soon the witch would be his, and once he
had her the slayer would follow.  Vlad looked around
the basement scanning for were the three women might
have went.  He noticed the large metal door on one of
walls and walked over to it.  Gabbing the door by the
handle he ripped it from it’s hinges and walked into
the room.  Rage filled the master vampyre’s  face, as
he looked around the empty room.  There was no way
they could have escaped him yet they were not there.
He repeatedly rammed his fist into the brick wall
screaming out in pure hatred, how could they have
escaped him, there had been no way out for them.</p>

<p>Just as Buffy finished off the two vampires ten more
began to come down the road towards her, she now was
more angry at them than before these demon seed were
keeping her form Willow, but why.  She was ready to
attack them when two of them turned to dust as stakes
penetrated their hearts.  She quickly looked over her
shoulder to see Giles and  Kathryn behind her both
rapidly reloading crossbows.   </p>

<p>Anya stood in front of Giles house not wanting to
believe what she saw.  Nothing remained but bricks and
ashes, smoke from the burnt out house filled the air
around her, as Tears began to pore down her cheeks.
Anya began to weep, <How many of her friends had been
inside when this happened>, silently she sat there not
knowing what to do or were to go.</p>

<p>Xander lay in hospital bed tossing in a restless
sleep, as Spike sat in the chair next to his bed.  The
blonde vampire looked at him admiring his handy work.
“When this is over I am going to bring your girl here
and kill her before your eyes before I finish the job
I started.”  Spike then got up and walked out of the
room knowing that soon he would be able to do what he
had always wanted to do and finish of the slayers
friends, but for now the master needed them where they
were in order to keep the slayers mind preoccupied
with them and not The master.</p>

<p>Buffy and the others now stood next to Anya, all of
them in shock at the site of what once had been Giles
home.  Buffy dropped to her knees as tears freely
flowed, <What had they done with Willow></p>
