<!-- Realms \ Part 1 -->

<p>Buffy sat up in her bed as the first rays of the early morning sun filtered
in through the window. The words of her spirit guide filled her mind, as
she looked across the dorm room at her best friend. For a moment she
thought about waiting for Willow to wake up and reveal her feelings for the
redheaded hacker, then she remembered the smile that filled Willow's face
when she was with Tara. A tear rolled down the blondes cheek, she couldn't
tell Willow how she felt, Tara made Willow happy and she had no right to
interfere with that, no matter what her spirit guide said or how bad it hurt
her inside to be this close to Willow without being able to take her secret
love in her arms and never let go.</p>

<p>Buffy once again knocked on Giles door, hoping that he would not be to upset
with her for waking him up so early on a Saturday morning. She needed to
talk to someone about what had happened in her dream, minus the part about
being in love with Willow, no one could ever now about that.</p>

<p>A groggy Giles handed Buffy a cup of coffee and looked at his watch as he
sat down in the recliner across from her, "So what brings you here so early
in the morning," He inquired hoping that everything was fine.</p>

<p>Buffy took a moment to collect her thoughts, "I have a question about a
dream I had last night."</p>

<p>"Go ahead"</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard of a spirit guide?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but why do ask?"</p>

<p>"I met mine last night."</p>

<p>Giles eased back in his chair and pondered what Buffy had just said, "I see,
what did they say?"</p>

<p>"She said that she was to help guide me in my life and that her name was
Fey."</p>

<p>Giles stared at Buffy as he recalled the signature in the mysterious book,
"Could you repeat that last part please"</p>

<p>"She said her name was Fey," replied Buffy wondering why Giles seemed so
interested in her spirit guide's name.</p>

<p>Giles got up and walked into his bedroom; leaving Buffy sitting by herself.
The slayer looked at the door to her watcher's bedroom wondering what was
going on and why he had decided to suddenly leave once she confirmed Fey's
name. Buffy was about to get up and find out what Giles was doing when he
walked back into the room carrying a rather old looking book, &lt;Giles plus
old book equals trouble for me&gt;.</p>

<p>Giles sat back down across from the slayer and noticed the look of despair
that had come over her, "Buffy, is something wrong?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, usually when you start whipping out old books like that after I had a
dream it means that some major bad is about to happen."</p>

<p>Giles smiled and in a reassuring voice replied, "I don't think you have any
thing to worry about, this book is more a history lesson than a prophecy."</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Tara's dorm room…</p>

<p>Willow and Tara sat in the circle surrounded by candles. Willow took the
blonde's hand and stared into her deep blue eyes, "So tell me about this
spell you want to try?"</p>

<p>"I-it's a Divination spell. It should give insight to t-the future."</p>

<p>Willow took Tara's other hand and smiled, "Shall we begin."</p>

<p>The two girls began chanting the words from the spell book that lay on the
ground between them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Willow found herself standing in a vast prairie with no sign of
civilization in any direction, before her stood a young woman with dark
brown hair. "Do not be afraid young Wicca, I mean no harm."</p>

<p>Willow was unsure what to say so she blurted out the first thoughts that
came into her mind, "Who are you and why have you brought me here?"</p>

<p>"I am called Fey, and it was not me but your spell that brought you here.
What is it that you seek?"</p>

<p>Willow stood there for a moment wondering what to ask, then it dawned on
her. "In the past I have been rather unfortunate in the romance area. So
could you tell me, is Tara the one?"</p>

<p>"No, I am afraid it is not meant to be." Before Willow could ask another
question Fey was gone and she found herself back in the circle with Tara who
seemed to be in some kind of trance..</p>

<p>Tara looked around the familiar setting that was her mother's house
wondering why the spell had brought her here. She heard a voice call her
name and spun around hoping to once again see her Mom, but instead an old
friend of the family greeted her.</p>

<p>The blonde witch looked at the older woman and smiled, "Fey, why have you
brought me here?"</p>

<p>"To find out what is going on with you and to remind you why you were sent
to outer earth in the first place."</p>
