<!-- Realms \ Part 10 -->

<p>Giles leaned back on the couch with a cup of tea in one hand and the
other wrapped around Joyce. He smiled as he looked around the room at
his extended family, "I want to thank all of you for coming to our
aid."</p>

<p>"You don't have to, after all you would have done the same for any of
us," Replied Buffy.</p>

<p>"Yes I do, it was a considerable risk you took by storming in on
Ciarán.  You saved our lives and I'll be forever in your debt for
that."</p>

<p>"Well in that case, your welcome," Buffy cheerfully replied as she
embraced Willow and pulled the red head close to her.</p>

<p>"Uh, I hate to ruin the moment, but speaking of Ciarán, does any one
have an idea of what happened to him," inquired Angel.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure, but I think he teleported himself out of the cabin."
replied Willow.</p>

<p>"Then he could be anywhere?"</p>

<p>Giles felt the sudden urge to hold on to Joyce and not let go.  He
sat down his tea and pulled her tightly up against him, "I'm afraid
that appears to be the case."</p>

<p>The mood in the room quickly changed from joy that Giles and Joyce
where safe, to a very somber tone, as they considered the
implications of the warlocks escape. Ciarán was out there and nobody
was safe.</p>

<p>"Where am I," inquired a groggy Faith?</p>

<p>"Your at Giles," answered Tara.</p>

<p>"Giles...the warlock, he's got him and B's mom, we've got to save
them," cried Faith as she tried to force herself out of bed.</p>

<p>Tara got up from the chair she had been sitting in ever since casting
the healing spell on the brunette slayer and walked over to the bed.
She put her hand on Faiths shoulder, "Buffy and Willow rescued them,
they're here, safe and sound."</p>

<p>"Oh...maybe I should go see them then."</p>

<p>"That can wait till tomorrow, you need to rest some more so the magic
can heal you."</p>

<p>Faith laid back down in the bed and sighed, she was glad that Giles
and Joyce were safe but wished that she would have been able to help
Buffy with the rescue.  After all, that's the way it had always been
since she came to Sunnydale, her and B versus whatever big nasty
decided to show itself. But, now that Buffy had finally hooked up
with Red maybe she didn't need her help anymore. Faith found herself
feeling very much alone in the world.</p>

<p>Tara sat on the edge of the bed and watched the brunettes face fill
with depression, she reached out and softly placed her hand on the
girls arm, "A penny for your thoughts."</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"Nothings wrong, I'm five by five."</p>

<p>"N-no you're not...it's written all over your face."</p>

<p>Faith laid there a few moments watching the blonde immortal before
finally speaking, "I don't think B needs my help any more."</p>

<p>"Why would you think that."</p>

<p>"Because she has Willow now, plus she seems to be some kind of super
slayer, why would she possibly need my help."</p>

<p>"Because not only are you a fellow slayer but your her friend,
besides I have a bad feeling that her and Willow are going to need
all the help they can get before this is over."</p>

<p>"It doesn't feel like that."</p>

<p>"Give it time," Tara stood up to leave, "I've g-got to go now, get
some rest."</p>

<p>"Tara?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Could you stay, I don't want to be alone."</p>

<p>"I-if you....W-want."</p>

<p>"I want."</p>

<p>Giles leaned up against the headboard with Joyce lying up by his
side, her head resting on his chest as he quietly played with her
silky hair. Just a half hour ago he had returned from the basement
after questioning Ethan and what he had learned terrified him.  Not
only had Ciarán made an ally, but it was the Demon Prince, Laoise.
Everything he had ever read about this powerful lord of darkness was
extremely bad.  He was referred to as the Destroyer of Worlds and
the  Bringer of Doom. Wherever he walked, death followed.  Giles
leaned over and kissed Joyce on the forehead as she slept, <We have
got to put an end to this alliance before  Laoise can come, but how?></p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy passionately embraced Willow and smothered the red head with
sweet tender kisses, "God Wills, I love you so much."</p>

<p>"I love you to Buffy," Moaned Willow as she wrapped her arms around
the slayer and began slowly running her left hand down the blondes
back.</p>

<p>Buffy gently tightened her grip on Willow and lifted her off the
ground.  </p>

<p>"Uh, Buffy what are you doing?"</p>

<p>The slayer moved swiftly towards Willows bed, she sat down pulling
Willow into her lap, "This," replied the blonde before pressing her
lips against Willow's.</p>

<p>The kiss seemed to last forever and neither one of them wanted it to
end, only the need for air forced them to break it."</p>

<p>"Huh, uh, t-that was amazing," gasped Willow.</p>

<p>"It certainly was," exclaimed Buffy as she laid back on the bed
pulling Willow down on top of her, "Let's do it again."</p>

<p>"OK," replied Willow as she brought her lips to the slayers.</p>

<p>Their bodies became entwined as they continued to fervently kiss one
another. The concerns and problems of the world where lost to them in
the passion of their love.  The fact that a powerful warlock was
roaming the streets of the Hellmouth didn't matter, in that moment
there was only the two of them and it was bliss.</p>

<p>The Middle Ethereal:</p>

<p>Alexandria walked across the Hall of the Slayers to Fey, "Where they
in time?"</p>

<p>"Yes and no, The watcher and The Warrior of Light's mother where
saved but the warlock was able to make an alliance with the Demon
Prince, Laoise."</p>

<p>"What do we do now?"</p>

<p>"Contact the void and let them now what has happened, besides that,
there is nothing to do but watch and wait."</p>

<p>"And when the warlock makes his move?"</p>

<p>"We hope The Warrior of Light and The Mage can stop him."</p>

<p>"And if they can't, and the Demon Prince comes?"</p>

<p>"Then the Realm wars begin once again."</p>
