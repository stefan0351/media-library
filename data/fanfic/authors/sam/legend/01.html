<p>Once in the distant past they had been called upir, then Vampyre, and
finally vampire.  They were the spawn of hell and roamed the lands of
eastern Europe, filling the hearts of its inhabitants with terror.
As there number grew they began to spread throughout the rest of
Europe and beyond.  The powers of light feared that this dark force
might eventually overrun the world so they combined there powers to
create a champion brining into creation the fist slayer.  They then
appointed a group of scholars and Shaman to watch after the champion
and to aid in the fight against the darkness, that is how watchers
came into being.   Then came the great one, the Master of the
Vampyre.  Every slayer that sought him perished at his hands, and
soon the other vampyre began to worship him.  The elder watchers
fearing that he would eventually destroy all the slayers formed a
council to govern over the other watchers and the slayers.  They sat
down rules and rituals that they thought would help in defeating this
powerful foe.  All their efforts were in vain and He continued his
rampage until one night he vanished.  The watchers throughout the
known world were sent out in search of ant sign of him but they could
find no, so they returned to their homes and went about their daily
business and silently prayed that He would never return.</p>

<p>LA</p>

<p> Cordelia woke up screaming only to find herself sitting at her desk
at Angel investigations.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" Angel said as he rushed over to see if
she was alright.</p>

<p>A very disturbed Cordelia answered, "I just had a vision that
scared the daylights out of me is what happened"</p>

<p>"What was it" Angel was almost afraid to ask that question
because almost always her visions met bad news for everyone.</p>

<p>"I saw twenty or so vamps standing in one of the cemeteries at
Sunnydale.  A young looking man with jet black hair, wearing all
black except for a cape that was a deep red with a golden circular
emblem over his hear that contained a symbol of a dragon, approached
them.  As he did they all dropped to their knees and bowed before
him.  Then one of the vamps spoke saying what is your biding our
Master."  Cordelia was visibly shacking as she continued to speak
of her vision.  She could barely bring herself to finish, "Then
he looked at them and replied Bring Me the Slayer"</p>

<p>Angel sat there in shock, He had to speak with the oracles, then they
had to get to Sunnydale as fast as they could.  His mind could barely
believe the description Cordelia had given in her vision, it simply
didn't want to, Buffy was in serous danger, they all were.  </p>

<p>Sunnydale</p>

<p>Riley Finn walked in a daze accrosed the campus.  Never before had he
felt so rejected.  All he had wanted to do was take Buffy out to a
movie, a possible first date, but that wasn't going to happen,
she had told him no, that she was in love with someone else but she
didn't know how to tell them.  His pity party was abruptly cut
short when a young man most likely  just a few years older than
himself seemly appeared put off nowhere and now stood directly in
front  of him.</p>

<p>He was not in the mood for this, "What do you want"</p>

<p>"I wish for you to take me to the one called professor Walsh"</p>

<p>"And may I ask why" Riley was getting very nervous and
agitated about this whole thing, something was not right about this.
He found himself wishing he had brought one of the weapons from the
initiative with him.</p>

<p>"I see we have gotten of on the wrong foot, allow me to introduce
myself.  I am called Vlad"
With that Riley's mind began to grow foggy, he found himself
unable to think straight as he looked into the eyes of the man who
stood before him.  The man smiled at Riley revealing a set of fangs
but not morphing into a vampire face and before Riley could do
anything he felt them seek into his neck.</p>

<p>LA</p>

<p>Angel and Cordelia were on the freeway headed out of LA and headed to
Sunnydale as fast as they could.  The Oracles had confirmed his worse
fear, The Master Vampyre was headed towards Sunnydale that is if he
was not already there.  That was what the oracles had said and
nothing more, they said that they knew nothing of his intentions or
what he was planning, but that He must go and help fight.  Angel
wished that he could had gotten more information from the oracles
after he was going to face Vlad Tepes, one who was rumored to have
killed over fifty slayers.</p>

<p>Sunnydale</p>

<p>"Mr. Finn what brings you here at this late hour"  Professor
Walsh asked as she looked up from grading the papers at her
desk.  "And who is your friend"</p>

<p> A smile came over Vlad's face, "I am someone who is
interested in your work with against my children"</p>

<p>"Your children" A confused Walsh replied</p>

<p>"Yes, My children", He then turned to Riley, "You may
feed now"</p>

<p>Before she could speak Riley vamped out and was on her before she
could even get out of the chair.  Vlad looked at him, "Very good
my child now lets get what we came for and destroy everything else
after all we can not allow your old friends to tamper with my
children and brethren, after all I will be requiring there services
shortly."  He then took a note from his pocket with a coin
attached
and tossed it on the desk.</p>

<p>The vampire Riley looked at him, "I understand my master"</p>

<p>It was  three in the morning when Giles opened his door to find Angel
and Cordelia standing there.  He looked at the two of them and the
worried expressions on both their faces.  "This is going to be
Big isn't"</p>

<p>Angel looked at the ex-watcher then spoke, "Giles, Vlad Tepes has
returned and is headed to Sunnydale"</p>

<p>Giles just stood their motionless for a few seconds, that he had just
heard was every watchers worst nightmare. He then forced a
response "Did you say  Vlad Tepes"</p>

<p> "I'm afraid so, Cordelia had a vision of him in Sunnydale
and the oracles confirmed it."</p>

<p>He immediately let the two in and rushed to the phone to call the
council.  Sure they had fired him and Buffy had broken off
communication, but the entire nature of the war had just changed.</p>

<p>The campus was buzzing, they had found Professor Walsh murdered in
her office when the janitorial staff had came in to open up the
buildings for classes.  Willow shouted out down the hall "Buffy
wait up I got some news"   </p>

<p>"What's up Will"</p>

<p>"Professor Walsh death appears to be Vampiric in nature" </p>

<p>"What you hear"  She replied as she pulled the redhead aside
so they could have a little more privacy</p>

<p>"They found her in her office, not a drop of blood in her.  The
place had been ransacked, looks like they were looking for
something"</p>

<p>"Alright grab your laptop and lets get over to Giles"</p>

<p>"Buffy what about class"</p>

<p>"Were going to have to skip classes today.  I got a really bad
feeling about this."</p>

<p>England</p>

<p>"Quentin, I just got of the phone with Giles" spoke Wesley.</p>

<p>"Well, does Ms. Summers wish to rejoin us" He said cutting of
the young council member.</p>

<p>"He didn't say, I'm afraid the news is rather bad"</p>

<p>"I almost afraid to ask, but what is so bad that would make Giles
contact us"</p>

<p>"The Master Vampyre has returned", Wesley couldn't
believe that He had uttered those words, just saying it sent a cold
shiver down his spine.</p>

<p>Quentin's voice filled with fear, all He could say was  "Vlad
Tepes?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid so" </p>

<p>They stood there a moment gazing at one another, then finally Quentin
spoke, "We got to assemble a team and head towards the Colonies
immediately"</p>

<p>Sunnydale</p>

<p>"Giles, we have to talk" Buffy shouted as she stormed into
Giles house with Willow in tow.</p>

<p>"Buffy, I am so glad to see you"  Giles said overjoyed the
slayer was unharmed.</p>

<p>"That's nice" said a slightly confused Buffy, "But
there is something big going at the college"</p>

<p>As Buffy continued to talk to Giles, Willow had already set up her
laptop and was busy hacking into the Sunnydale police department data
files. "Giles, we believe that vampires killed on of our
professors and that they were looking for something specific."</p>

<p>"I see", Giles paused for a moment then continued, "Angel
is here"</p>

<p>The slayer stood there stunned for a moment, "I take it he
didn't just drop in to say high"</p>

<p>"I wish he did, it seems that a very powerful vampire has
re-emerged and is either headed to Sunnydale or already here"</p>

<p>Before Buffy could ask what kind of vampire would be enough to make
Angel pack up and come to Sunnydale Willow interrupted the
conversation.  The young Wicca's voice was filled with
enthusiasm, over the fact that she was able to help Buffy.  After all
helping Buffy, just being around Buffy made her very happy. </p>

<p>"Willow, you said you found it" asked the Slayer</p>

<p>"Yeah, I got the file on professor Walsh's death"</p>

<p>"Way to go, I new my Wills could do it"</p>

<p>Willow slightly blushed at Buffy's comment, but that quickly
vanished to a face of despair as she read what the report said.  </p>

<p>"Buffy can we get back to our conversation" Asked a
frustrated Giles</p>

<p>"Just a second, something's wrong", Buffy then turned away
from Giles and back to Willow, "What's in that report"</p>

<p>"They found some stuff, that the vampires left behind"</p>

<p>"Like what"</p>

<p>"A note that said 'Slayer, I Come.', and a gold coin with a dragon
symbol on it.  The report said the the local jeweler appraised it at
over five hundred years old"</p>

<p>Buffy turned back to see that Giles had sat down and concern showed
all over his face.  "Giles what's wrong"</p>

<p>All the ex-watcher could say was, "He's already here" </p>

<p>"Who's already here" replied the slayer pretty sure she
didn't want to her the answer.</p>

<p>"Vlad Tepes"</p>

<p>"Who's Vlad Tepes", Willow asked as she walked over from
her laptop next to Buffy.</p>

<p>The two girls grabbed one another's hand for comfort when they heard
Giles answer, "He is the Master Vampyre, and before you ask I did
not pronounce it wrong.  That is what they were called the last time
he was seen. As for his name Tepes is Slavic for the Impaler"</p>

<p>"You mean as in Vlad the Impaler" asked Willow</p>

<p>"Yes, I am afraid that Vlad Dracul has decided to return"</p>

<p>"What a minute, your pulling MY leg, come on Dracula" Buffy
retorted, "I mean that is all myth and fantasy"</p>

<p>"Yes allot of it is, but Vlad Dracul was a real person.  He was
the ruler of  a Romanian state called Wallachia.  Most people believe
he was assassinated around 1475, but the truth is that right around
that time he became a vampire.  While the records from that time
period are sketchy it is estimated that he is responsible for
murdering about fifty slayers before he simply vanished without a
trace." </p>

<p>Willow gave Buffy a hug and didn't let go, But the slayer seemed
not to mind.  "Did you say fifty slayers" asked the Redheaded
hacker.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so but that is over a period of a hundred and 20
years."</p>

<p>"And how come that doesn't make me feel any better"
replied a very upset slayer.</p>

<p>"This time it will be different, I haven't figured it out yet but
We will come up with something" Giles said trying to comfort her,
but know this is most likely the biggest thing a slayer has faced
since the last time Vlad was known to walk the earth.</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow sat on the couch as Giles was in the kitchen talking with Angel and Cordelia trying to find out any information they might have on Vlad Tepes Dracul's return.</p>

<p>"Wills, Can we talk"</p>

<p>"Sure, We can always talk"</p>

<p>"Why"</p>

<p>"Why what Buffy"</p>

<p>"Why is all this happening. Wasn't enough that a neutered Spike is running around Sunnydale, and that there is some secret group running around capturing vampires and demons for who knows what purposes. Then if that isn't enough Oz leaves hurting you in the process. So why now, with all this going on does this Vlad guy have to show up"</p>

<p>"I don't know Buffy ," Willow then looked at the slayer with a look of confusion. She paused for a second then simply stated , "You noticed."</p>

<p>"Noticed what"</p>

<p>"That I was hurting, after all there is so much going on in your life with Spike the commandos and everything Hellsmouth"</p>

<p>Buffy seemed hurt that Willow thought she hadn't noticed, "Of course I noticed. Willow I care for you, your my best friend, When you hurt I hurt to", She then proceeded to give Willow a big hug.</p>

<p>After the hug had ended Willow looked at her, "If it helps any Oz's departure made me sad but it didn't hurt that much"</p>

<p>"It Didn't"</p>

<p>"I was going to break things off with him, but he sorta beat me to the punch" </p>

<p>Buffy sat there for a moment pondering Willows last statement, "You were going to break up with him, I thought the two of you were happy"</p>

<p>"We were, he was a great friend, but I just didn't love him anymore"</p>

<p>She knew she probably shouldn't ask, but the slayer couldn't resist "Why"</p>

<p>Willow didn't answer the question she just sat there lost in her own train of thought. &lt;Should she tell the truth, did she dare express the emotions that have been ravishing her mind the last few months&gt; </p>

<p>Buffy was afraid she had went to far and carefully spoke, "Earth to Willow, you still there"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm still here"</p>

<p>"Look Wills, I am sorry if I pushed to far. I shouldn't have asked the question" said the slayer, her eyes filled with apology</p>

<p>"No, it's not that"</p>

<p>"Then what is it", Buffy asked unsure of what was happening in Willows mind.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure how to answer it, even if I should answer it"</p>

<p>"Then don't answer it", Buffy softly spoke not wanting to force Willow to do something she didn't want to</p>

<p>"Buffy, I want to answer it just not right now, not here.", Willow then looked Buffy directly in the eyes, "However since you put me on the hot seat I got a question for you"</p>

<p>"Go ahead, fire away"</p>

<p>"Are you over Angel"</p>

<p>"That's easy, Yes", replied the slayer, relieved at how easy a question she had gotten, "Is that it"</p>

<p>"No, if your over him then why have you been shooting every guy who ask you out down in flames."</p>

<p>Buffy thought to herself for a second, &lt;Willow knew how to put someone on the spot when she had to&gt; "I need to think that one over, how about if we give each other our answers tonight after I get back from patrol."</p>

<p>"Sounds fair," Willow replied, very happy that she didn't have to answer Buffy's question right away.</p>

<p>"Then tonight it is, lets go and see what's going on in the Kitchen"</p>

<p>The two girls got up and started to go into the kitchen when the doorbell rang. Buffy went over to the door yelling in the general direction of the kitchen, "I got it"</p>

<p>The slayer stood in the open door way, rage filled her eyes. She was clenching her fist so tight that her knuckles were turning white. Her body seemed to tremble in anger as she coldly stared at the three who stood on the porch before her. Only one thought raced through her mind, &lt;What the hell are they doing here.&gt;</p>

<p>"Good afternoon, Miss Summers" said Quentin as he looked at a very angry slayer.</p>

<p>"Giles you better get your butt out here, NOW" Shouted Buffy</p>

<p>Giles ran out of the kitchen to see what was wrong. Then he saw that Quentin, Wesley and Megan were standing on his porch and Buffy looked like she was two seconds from staking them. Thinking fast on how to resolve the situation he carefully spoke, "Buffy would you please let them in. I asked them here to help us and they agreed."</p>

<p>"Giles what is going on here, have you lost your mind", Buffy said as she stepped aide allowing them in. She carefully eyed them as they passed by her and walked over towards Giles.</p>

<p>"Buffy, we need them"</p>

<p>Buffy's words were laced with bitterness as she silently recalled their betrayal, "I need them like I need a whole in the head"</p>

<p>"You don't understand, they are here to help and I suggest we listen to what they have to say"</p>

<p>"Oh I see, and just forgot what they did to both of us" </p>

<p>"Buffy, what happened was done in the past, but now we must deal with what is going on in the present and that is that Vlad Tepes has returned. All of us have to put the past behind us, if we are going to stand a chance"</p>

<p>Buffy stood there clenching her fist and not even responding to Giles.</p>

<p>Quentin looked to the slayer and spoke, "Miss Summers, I know your upset but Giles is correct. We have come to help in what ever way we can"</p>

<p>Buffy verbally lashed out at him, "And why would that be, after all you haven't exactly been that helpful in the past."</p>

<p>"In the past you did not need our help as much as you do now" Retorted Quentin</p>

<p>"And I don't need it now, after all Vlad, Dracula what ever you want to call him is a vampire, Right."</p>

<p>"That is Correct, but...", Before Quentin could finish Buffy cut him off.</p>

<p>"Then I find him, stake him and it will be over with."</p>

<p>"It will not be that easy Miss Summers, Vlad Tepes is not your everyday vampire"</p>

<p>"I've beaten the master, Acathla, Kakistos, even the mayor. I did all of that without the councils help, and I can do this without the councils help"</p>

<p>Quentin did not know what to say, how to get through to the slayer, "Giles can you have to help us on this one"</p>

<p>"Buffy you got to listen, Vlad Tepes makes you average vampire look like the Avon lady. Did you forget how many slayers I told you he had killed" Pleaded Giles, his voice echoing the desperation that had made him call England in the first place.</p>

<p>He was starting to get through, Buffy stood there looking at Giles as his words hit home. Here mind recalled what he had said earlier and it and it made the hairs on her neck stand up &lt;Fifty slayers&gt;.
</p>

<p>Willow grabbed Buffy's hand wanting to comfort her best friend. She then looked at the Quentin and the others then to Giles, "What exactly is this vampire"</p>

<p>Quentin looked at Giles and when Giles nodded to him he spoke, "Vlad Tepes Dracul is a walking nightmare. Even before he became Vampyre he did things that one would think only demons were capable of. Once he became Vampyre he gave new meaning to the word horror." </p>

<p>Seeing that Quentin was having trouble getting out the words to describe this true monster, Giles took over "He stalked Europe killing anyone and anything that stood in his way. Every slayer and watcher that was sent to destroy him never returned. This gained him royalty status among other Vampires and in time they even came to worshipped him as if He their God"</p>

<p>Giles had spoken all that he could bring himself to say and his last few words were fluttered, That is when Wesley took over, "Buffy you are aware of what a master vampire is."</p>

<p>"Yes, so this Vlad is a master Vampire"</p>

<p>"Not just a master Vampire, he is THE MASTER VAMPIRE. All other vampires will now that he has returned follow him and do his bidding. He is stronger and more powerful than any vampire that is know to exist. This is mainly because he barley had a soul to loose, before He was turned. As a man he craved cruelty, destruction, and vengeance and becoming Vampyre only increased his already dark heart. He is the embodiment of evil, dedicated to death and destruction of all that stands before him." </p>

<p>Wesley had finished speaking and now no one said a thing, they just stood there waiting for the slayer's response. It seemed as if time was standing still as they all stood there in silence, Buffy tighten the grip she had on Willows hand. She had heard what they all had said and the hurt she still felt over their betrayal seemed not to be that important any more, she knew that she would have no choice but to accept their offer and for the first time in a long while she was truly afraid of what the night held for her. </p>

<p>They had talked the rest of the day there at Giles, and even after all that talk no one was sure what to do, they didn't even know why he had returned or what he was planning. Buffy had learned that The female was named Megan and that she was some kind of mystic, brought to try and determine what Vlad Tepes Dracul was up to but so far all her spells had been unsuccessful. It had then been decided that Everyone would return to there homes before sunset and the council members would stay with Giles so they could get more research done and possibly uncover something that they were missing. Giles also had insisted that Angel and Cordelia stay with him and they had agreed to. </p>

<p>Everyone seemed to be shaken up a bit when Buffy had insisted on going about her normal patrol to see if she could find out anything. Only when Angel had offered to go with her did they finally relent to the slayers will, and now here they were walking the cemetery, each one hoping not to run in to Vlad Tepes.</p>

<p>"Buffy are you O.K."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not"</p>

<p>"Don't worry they will find a way to beat him", Angel said trying to comfort Buffy but unsure of his own words.</p>

<p>"And what if they don't"</p>

<p>Angel had no answer for that, the very thought of the destruction the master vampyre would bring if he wasn't stopped was more than he would dare think of. So they walked in silence. Then they heard the sound of a fight up ahead. The two of them causelessly approached from the trees, remaining concealed from whoever or whatever was just a few yards away.</p>

<p>Before them where were three of the commandos and they had cornered Spike. One of them shot him with some kind of stun gun and he dropped to the ground. She was contemplating rescuing him and trying to find out if he knew anything about the reappearance of Vlad Tepes when Riley approached the group.</p>

<p>"Finn it's good to see you, were have you been" Said the commando holding the weapon.</p>

<p>Riley looked at his former friends and spoke, "I have been with the master"</p>

<p>"What master" questioned the commando as he pointed his weapon at Riley.</p>

<p>Riley pointed to the trees behind the commando, "The master"</p>

<p>As all three commandos spun around, the one with his weapon pulled was grabbed by the neck by a figure that had suddenly stepped out from behind a nearby tree. The figure then violently flung him to the ground and quickly was upon another one of the commandos. The third commando pulled his weapon and was ready to fire when a vamped out Riley jumped him from and sank his teeth into the neck of his former comrade draining him of his life force. The figure held his victim in his hands and all the sudden with the flick of his wrist snapped the boys neck like it was a twig. Buffy was about to go help the remaining commando and capture Spike when Angel grabbed her and held her back. The figure stepped out of the shadows and began walking towards the last of the commandos. He reached down and sunk his fangs into the commando's neck. After that he looked at Spike and spoke.</p>

<p>"William the Bloody allow me to introduce myself. I am Vlad Tepes Dracul."</p>

<p>With that Spike stood there in awe gazing into the face of the master vampyre before he spoke, "What do you wish of me," </p>

<p>Buffy an Angel were running towards campus as fast as they could. Both of them in shock over what they had just witnessed and neither of them wishing to face the master vampyre.</p>

<p>Back at the cemetery Vlad was talking with Spike as they walked around the tombs with Riley in tow.</p>

<p>"Tell me William, what have they done to you"</p>

<p>"They put something in my head, I can't kill. It`s driving me bloody nuts."</p>

<p>"Do you wish to kill again"</p>

<p>"Yes of course I do. Its so much fun"</p>

<p>"Good, I have recently discovered some information that can correct your problem. However first we must gather some of my children so we can retrieve it, and rescue the others of our kind"</p>

<p>Angel had dropped her off then rushed back to Giles to tell them what had happened. Buffy now stood out in the hallway still shaken up over what she had just witnessed and partially afraid to go through the door, afraid of what might happen when she gave Willow her answer, and spoke the truth. She had been standing there for five minutes trying to get up the courage to walk through the door but couldn't get her body to move. She knew no matter what the outcome her live would change forever once she stepped through the door and that shook her up more than actually seeing Vlad Tepes had done. </p>

<p>Another fifteen minutes passed before she was able to reach out and turn the door knob. She stood in the open doorway wanting to go inside and reveal her heart but afraid to.</p>

<p>"Buffy are you coming in or are you just going to stand there looking at me."</p>

<p>"I saw him", She replied trying to delay the inevitable.</p>

<p>"Saw who", Willow inquired concerned that something seemed to be upsetting Buffy.</p>

<p>"Vlad Tepes Dracul"</p>

<p>Willow jumped out from behind her desk and rushed over to Buffy who was still standing in the doorway. Her eyes filled with worry as she looked at the blonde, "Are you O.K."</p>

<p>"Yeah, He didn't see us but Spikes and Riley are with him now"</p>

<p>"Riley?"</p>

<p>"Is now a vampire"</p>

<p>"Oh, my" Willow looked at Buffy then continued to speak, " look it's been a rough night, If you don't want to have are talk I'll understand"</p>

<p>Buffy thought about Willows words for a second, "No, I can't keep what I have to say inside any longer, no matter what the outcome", she then stepped into their dorm room and closed the door behind them.</p>

<p>They both sat on their own beds looking at one another each of them wandering who would speak first and hoping it was the other. It was Buffy who finally gave in. "Willow, the question you asked me"</p>

<p>"Yes, what about it"</p>

<p>"The truth is that I keep turning everyone down because I am in love with someone already"</p>

<p>Willow noticed the sadness that filled Buffy's face as she spoke, "In love that's great but why so sad"</p>

<p>Buffy took a big gulp of air as she gathered her courage, it was now or never she told herself. "I have been in love with her for a few months now and don't know how to tell her"</p>

<p>"Her?"</p>

<p>"Her." </p>

<p>Willow thought about what about what Buffy had just said. She knew that this could make her revelation quite happy or even more painful than she could imagine. Buffy was in love with another girl, but what if it wasn't her.</p>

<p>Seeing her friend just sit there and look at her made Buffy uneasy, she was starting to feel that her telling the truth about her loving Willow was going to turn out badly, but there was no going back now, she had went to far. "Willow I'm sorry, I've shocked you. If you want me to leave I will"</p>

<p>Willow quickly recomposed herself, "No, don't leave. I think it's great. Who is she?" Willow felt a wave of nervousness rush over her, she knew that all her hopes for happiness depended on Buffy's answer.</p>

<p>"Her name is Willow and she`s my best friend"</p>

<p>Willow couldn't believe what she had just heard, her answer was just made very easy. "Buffy you asked me why I didn't love Oz any more even before he left"</p>

<p>"Yes," Buffy spoke wondering what was going through Willows mind after all she had just confessed her love for the redheaded , "I did"</p>

<p>Willow got up, walked over to Buffy and sat beside her, "The reason was because I had fallen in love with you"</p>

<p>Realizing what was happening between them the two girls hugged one another affectingly, their hearts filled with happiness on the love they had just discovered, both of them knowing that their lives had changed for the better. In that moment there seemed to be no one else in the entire world, it was just the two of them and they didn`t want it to ever end.</p>

<p>Willow paced their dorm room nervously, it had been an hour ago that
Angel had dropped by to pick Buffy up for their patrol of the area.
She had done three different protection spells on her new found love
before she left, just to be on the safe side and had also made Angel
promise that they would not be out that long.   She had always
worried when the slayer went out on patrol before, even more so when
she had begun to realize she was in love with her best friend.  Now
the worry that filled her mind was worse than ever, they had
professed their love for one another and were on the verge of
something extraordinary, the fact that she was now out there and so
was Dracul made tore at Willows heart.  She had said several prayers
to the Goddess asking for protection for her love and now all there
was to do was wait.  She knew her mind would not know a moments rest
until Buffy walked through the door.</p>

<p>Quentin, Wesley, and Megan were sitting around the table researching
as they had done all day, trying with no success to try and unlock
the mystery that seemed to surround Vlad Tepes Dracul.  Cordelia had
driven Xander and Anya home and would be back anytime now and Angel
was out on patrol with Buffy.  That had put Giles nerves on the edge
of madness.  He was finding it hard to concentrate knowing that not
all of them were inside out of the dark, but there was little they
could do about that.  Nothing they had read today seemed to point to
any particular reason while Vlad Tepes Dracul had re-emerged and
Megan's spells couldn't reveal his intentions.  The only answer
was to
allow Buffy to go on patrol to see if her and Angel could learn
anything.</p>

<p>Buffy walked with Angel at her side as the two of them carefully
maneuvered their way to through the cemetery.  "Buffy, does it
bother you that we have been out here for an hour and all we have
seen is more of those commandos from last night out patrolling the
area"</p>

<p>"So it's a slow night, this happens from time to time"</p>

<p>"Yeah, but it shouldn't happen with Vlad Tepes in town.  I
have a really bad feeling that something big is going down"</p>

<p>"Well I hope your wrong but my slayer sense tells me your not,
maybe we should pick up our pace a little."</p>

<p>They had finished up the patrol of the cemetery and were now making
their rounds at the campus.  As they were walking Angel suddenly
froze, He stood there with a look of utter terror on his eyes, His
inner voice cried out to him, &lt;It has begun.&gt;</p>

<p>"Buffy, do you see what I see"</p>

<p>The slayer looked in the direction Angel had pointed and as soon as
she saw it she wanted to throw up.  She quickly turned away and was
desperately trying to regain her composer, "My God, why would
anyone, even a vampire, do something like that," she was filled
with
terror and disbelief at what she had seen. &lt;What was going on&gt;</p>

<p>Angel walked over to the Slayer and put his arm on her
shoulders, "They wouldn't, but Vlad Tepes Dracul would.  I
have to let Giles and the others know about this, I`m take you
back to
your dorm this patrol is over"</p>

<p>Willow answered the door to find Angel and a very shaken up Buffy.
The slayer was trembling at the knees and she looked as if all the
color had been drained from her face.  "Buffy are you O.K."
Willow said as she helped the blonde into the room.</p>

<p>"She had a pretty big shock when we stumbled across some handy
work of Vlad Tepes, but she will be fine.  She is just a little
nauseous and I can`t say I blame her."</p>

<p>"What did you guys find"</p>

<p>"Willow, you don't want to know, trust me", with that
Angel departed for Giles.</p>

<p>"Buffy, Are you going to be alright"  Willow inquired as she
helped Buffy set down.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure, I have never seen anything like it before"</p>

<p>"Buffy we live in a Hellsmouth, what could have been so bad"</p>

<p>Buffy sat there for a moment and then looked at Willow, there was no
way she was going to tell the beautiful redhead what they had
seen.  "Will, hold me,"  She pleaded.</p>

<p>Willow took Buffy in her arms and started gently rocking her back and
forth as they sat on Willows bed, "I've got you Buffy, you're
with me now, you're safe"</p>

<p>Angel burst into Giles house surprising the ex-watcher and the
others.  "Cordelia could you go up stairs for a moment I need to
talk with Giles and the council in private"</p>

<p>Cordelia made her way upstairs as Giles looked at Angel, "What
happened, is Buffy safe"</p>

<p>"She's safely back at the dorm," He paused for a second
waiting for Cordelia to be completely up the stairs and out of
earshot of what he had to say, "Giles it's begun"</p>

<p>"What's begun"</p>

<p>"We came accrosed five of those commandos, they had been killed
by Vlad Tepes."  Angel stopped for a second trying to compose
himself and muster the strength to say what had to be said, "He
impaled them and placed the stakes they were on in a circle.  From
the looks of things they most likely were alive when he did it"</p>

<p>"Oh my" were the only words that Giles could form in response
to Angels news.  He had read the horror stories on Vlad Tepes
Dracul.  Both the ones that most scholars are aware of and the ones
Quentin had brought with him from England.  However to hear that
those horrendous acts were starting up again and in the very town
that he lived in was almost more than his mind could handle at once.
He was not alone, the faces of the three council members showed that
similar thoughts were also going through their heads. </p>

<p>Angel lowered his head, "I'm afraid there is more.  There was
a sixth stake in the circle that was empty", He stammered out the
last
couple off words before setting down.</p>

<p>The others walked over to him and gathered around him, Giles looked
at him and spoke "What about the sixth stake"</p>

<p>"It had a message"</p>

<p>Giles face filled with concern, remembering the last message that He
had left at professor Walsh's office.  His voice trembled as he
spoke, "A message, what sort of message"</p>

<p>"It Said.." Angel found that he was having trouble getting
the words out.  He had to tell them so they could help her, but the
though of what Vlad Tepes was threatening formed a lump in his throat
that seemed to hold his words prisoner behind it.</p>

<p>"Angel, You've got to tell us!  What did the note on the sixth
stake say"</p>

<p>His mind drifted for a moment to Buffy, they were no longer part of
one another's life the way they had used to be but he still cared
for her and didn't want to see anything happen to her.  He took a
deep breath, and a tear followed by another rolled down his cheek,
he then forced out the only word that had been written on the
note, "Slayer"  </p>

<p>They all sat there for a moment trying to absorb what they had just
learned.  Slowly they began to head back to the table, if they had to
they would research all night, something had  to be found.  Somewhere
their had to be something on this ancient vampire that they were
missing, He had to be stopped before he could act on his threat, they
had to find a way stop him, they had to help save the slayer.</p>

<p>A military HUMVEE slowly rolled its way through the nearly deserted
streets of Sunnydale.  "Something's wrong sir, No one is
answering back at the base camp"  Said a young commando as he
drove
the colonel in charge of running the initiative base through
Sunnydale to see how the patrols were doing.</p>

<p>"Can you reach any of the Patrols"</p>

<p>"Yes sir, all except for alpha team"</p>

<p>"Call team Delta and have them search for Alpha.  Recall all the
others back to the base"</p>

<p>"Yes sir" said the commando as he turned around the HUMVEE
and headed back towards the secret underground base.</p>

<p>The two commandos who had been guarding the entrance now lay dead on
the cold marble floor, as Spike and Riley stepped over their still
warm bodies, following their master into the heart of the
initiative.  Vlad was following the diagram he had found in Walsh's
office and was headed straight for the research center of the
complex.  A young commando jumped out in front of Vlad with weapon
drawn yelling for them to halt.  Before the commando could even
finish his sentence Vlad grabbed him by the throat with one hand
lifting him off of the ground.  In just a few seconds the air had
been squeezed out of the young commando and he was gone.  The small
group of vampires ran into a few more stray scientist and commandos
before they reached the research center and each time Vlad quickly
killed them not even bothering to feed, his mind focused on one
thing.. </p>

<p>As the doors to the research center flung open the five scientist
that were working in their spun around only to come face to face with
Vlad.  "I can use your services to help my children" Spoke
the master vampyre as he grabbed two of the scientist by their lab
coats.  He then looked at Riley, You may kill the others.  Riley
vamped out and took down the first scientist rather easily and made
his move on the second.  Vlad took one of the scientist and held him
with one arm  up in the air above his head as he fed off of  and
turned the other.  When he was done, he lowered the other scientist
and repeated the process.  Riley had just finished on his second
victim when the remaining scientist got the drop on him and now had
one of the initiatives weapons pointed at him.  However before he
could fire the weapon was ripped from his hand, "I have no use
for
you" said the master vampyre as he grabbed the remaining
scientist
with both hands, lifting him in the air above his head and holding
him there. "You know William, I am feeling like my old self"
 said
the master vampyre as he brought the helpless scientist down accrosed
his knee breaking his back. </p>

<p>As the Initiative teams raced back to their base they had no clue as
to what was happening there or what they would find.  Spike headed
down to the holding area with Riley as Vlad gathered all the
information he needed to cure his children from the scientist
research materials.  He had just finished up when spike and Riley
returned with about twenty some vampires.  </p>

<p>"Allow me to introduce myself, I am Vlad Tepes Dracul,"
Spoke the master vampyre.  Upon hearing those words  the newly
released vampires dropped to their knees and bowed before their
master.  Vlad looked at his minions then spoke, "I know what they
have done to you but tonight I have gained what is needed to restore
you to your true nature.  I know that you can not harm humans in your
present state but you still can do damage.  Rip this place apart"

After Vlad had finished speaking the vampires began to tear the
inside of the imitative apart.</p>

<p>About forty  initiative soldiers stood outside the complex waiting for
the Colonel to return.  They were all there except teams Alpha and
Delta and a few that had been left behind to secure the complex while
they were gone.  They wanted to go inside and see why they had lost
communications but they had been ordered to stay outside until the
colonel arrived.  While they were waiting they failed to notice a
group of vampires slip out the back door with two scientist in hand.
A few minuets later his HUMVEE rolled up and they proceeded into the
complex.</p>

<p>They walked the hallways in shock.  The place had been torn apart,
some of the data had been taken but most of it had been destroyed in
what looked like pure vandalism.  The few soldiers and all the
scientist who had been in the complex were now dead.  The strangest
thing however was found in the holding area.  All the demons they had
captured were still in their cells but not a single vampire
remained.  The biggest shock had come when Delta team called in to
report the fate of their missing comrades.  The colonel looked at his
troops, what had happened.  He reluctantly made his way to the office
to call Washington only to learn that the communications grid in the
complex had been destroyed with everything else, they had been cut
off from there superiors.  His only option was to call using his cell
phone and pass the code word that said the operation was a bust, and
await orders.</p>

<p>Willow had finally pried what had happened out on patrol out of
Buffy, "Look it's not going to happen.  I won't let it
happen.  We will find away to beat him," Buffy softly spoke
Trying to
comfort Willow.  &lt;Why did she let Willow talk her into telling what
she had seen&gt;</p>

<p>"Buffy," Sobbed Willow, "I just found you and I don't
want to lose you"</p>

<p>"And you won't.  We'll beat this thing, somehow we will
beat Dracul" the slayers voice was filled with confidence.  She
knew
she had to win she just didn't know how to do it.  She had finally
discovered true love and for the first time she felt almost normal as
she held Willow in her arms. &lt;Master Vampyre or not, no one was going
to take her away from Willow&gt;</p>

<p>Sunrise brought no peace to Sunnydale, the town was in shock at the
murder scene that had been found in the early morning at the campus.
The slayerettes were at Giles trying to figure out what to do, the
whole situation seemed to get worse every night since Dracul had
rolled into town.  To make matters even worse while Megan had not
been able to determine Vlad's plan she had however been able to
use her magic to learn that he was building his forces and had freed
several vampires that had been  captured.  While she didn't know
what that met Buffy filled them in on the information they had gotten
from Spike during the brief time he was in their custody.</p>

<p>They were waiting for the others to arrive at the house and Cordelia
was ensuring that all the windows were properly covered so Angel
could safely participate in the research.  </p>

<p>"Giles could I talk to you a moment in private" Inquired
Quentin.</p>

<p>"Sure, How about out back"</p>

<p>"That would be fine" Quentin replied as the two headed for
the back door.</p>

<p>"Did you find something" asked Giles upon reaching the back
porch.</p>

<p>"Not yet, but we will.  We have to.  The reason I asked you out
here is two fold"</p>

<p>"I see" Giles said even though he had no idea what was going
on.</p>

<p>"Giles, on behalf of the council I would like to apology to you
for the way you were treated.  I just wish that it would have been
under better circumstances that we realized that.. "</p>

<p>"That what"</p>

<p>"That you were right.  It is unfortunate that it took the very
return of the very one the council was created to fight against to
make us realize that we had been wrong in our treatment of the
slayers.  Had we been handling things more like you perhaps fewer
slayers would have died in recent years and maybe we would be better
prepared to face Vlad Tepes Dracul.  So I ask you this Mr. Giles, do
you accept the councils apology"</p>

<p>Giles could see that he had met every word he had spoken.  He even
agreed with him, it was unfortunate that it took the master vampyre
returning to make them see their mistakes.  Giles extended his hand
toward Quentin, "I accept"</p>

<p>"Giles"</p>

<p>"Yes"</p>

<p>"We would like to have you back as a watcher.  You will of course
be assigned to Ms. Summers.  We will also give you back pay.  Please
come back, we need a good watcher like yourself if we are going to
bring down Dracul."</p>

<p>"Count me in ", replied the newly instated watcher.  For the
first time since this ordeal started things were starting to look up,
but He knew usually that it was a sign that it was about to get
really ugly. </p>

<p>After a heated discussion with Giles, Buffy had agreed to accept the
councils apology and communicate with them after Dracul was done
with.  The fact that they had thrown in the after Dracul had helped
allot.  She realized they had faith in her, they knew she could win,
they just had to find out how.  It seemed that the major problem was
that there was a lack of prophecies about him.  He simply came into
being, wrecked havoc, vanished, and now reappeared,  the fact that
they knew so little about him made him all the more dangerous.  It
however did not go as well when they informed the slayer about
Megan's discovery.</p>

<p>"Why is it every time we learn something it only makes this
situation worse", Shouted an agitated slayer.</p>

<p>"Buffy, We are doing the best we can" Giles said trying to
reassure her.</p>

<p>"I know, but it seems that he is out there one step ahead of the
rest of us, and were trying to play catch up as he leads us along.
If we keep this up eventually he is going to lead us right were he
wants us"  Buffy sat down after having spoke, she realized what
she
had said and after what she had seen last night  she didn't like
were
that road lead to.  </p>

<p>Willow ran over to Buffy, sitting down and taking her into her arms.
Tears rolled down the redheads cheeks, "Giles, we have to do
something, we can't allow Dracul to win."  Willow was
pleading with him, her voice filled with the fear of losing
Buffy, "Please do something, I don't want to lose her"</p>

<p>Giles gave Willow a rather curious look, he knew that they were close
friends that had a special bond but the way Willow was acting was
beyond even that.  He looked around the room to see that Xander and
Anya were also giving the two girls curious looks, and Angel was
smiling and yet managed to appear sad at the same time.  So he
stepped into his surrogate parental role.  "Quentin do you mind
if I take this little group into the kitchen for a talk"</p>

<p>"Giles feel free to do whatever you feel is necessary."
Quentin replied before going back to researching with the others.</p>

<p>Giles, Angel, and the Slayerettes stood in the Kitchen, looking at
one another.</p>

<p>"So G-man, what`s up" asked a boisterous Xander</p>

<p>"Really Xander, How many times do I have to ask you not to call
me that"</p>

<p>"Sorry Giles, what's up"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me.  I called this little meeting to try and
figure out that very question"</p>

<p>"Giles, your not making any sense," stated Buffy</p>

<p>"I'm concerned over Willows behavior in there, and since I
feel that we are practically a family we should try and support one
another."</p>

<p>"I'm just worried, about Buffy" answered the redheaded
hacker</p>

<p>"I know that Willow, however you were the verge of bursting into
tears.  Is everything O.K. between the two of you.  I know that
recent events could put strains on friendships, and If that is the
case we need it straightened out before Buffy has to face Dracul"</p>

<p>Both the girls simultaneously blushed, then took one another's
hands.  It was Buffy who answered Giles this time, "We're
fine, in fact were better than fine"</p>

<p>"Good I just wanted to be sure, remember if either one of you
need to talk I'm here"  Said a perplexed Giles.  He was glad
that
things were good in their friendship but what was happening between
the two them.</p>

<p>Willow looked at Buffy, "Maybe we should tell them"</p>

<p>"Tell us what" Asked Xander</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head yes and with that Willow said, "that we love
each other"</p>

<p>"Duh, your best friends.  tell me something I don't know"
Whimsically replied Xander</p>

<p>Buffy smiled, "Let me rephrase what Willow said"  She paused
for a moment as she wrapped her arm around Willows waste and Willow
responded by doing the same, "We are in love with each other"</p>

<p>Point, Match, Game goes to Buffy and Willow.  Xander was stunned but
happy for the two of them.  Anya thought it was about time they
hooked up and Cordelia tended to agree with her.  Angel had expected
as much and while he still cared for her he realized that they both
have moved on.  After Giles got over the initial shock He was truly
happy for them.  They wished they could have talked about it more but
there was work to be done.  The Sun would be gong down soon and
Dracul remained a mystery.</p>

<p>Then the sun went down and with it came Spike, resorted to his former
self, and the newly appointed lieutenant of Vlad Tepes Dracul.  He
had but one goal in mind as he stepped out from the crypt into the
night air with several other recently restored vamps behind him, find
any of those left in Sunnydale who had imprisoned them.  The time to
lead the slayer to the master would come soon enough, now was the
time for revenge.</p>

<p>The colonel had left for DC earlier that day, the rest of the
initiative were to report there in a week for debriefing, the entire
project had been scrapped before it got under way.  Now the forty
remaining Commandos stood at what use to be the entrance to their
complex, which was soon to be filled with concrete and the events of
the past few days forgotten , the deaths of their comrades would be
written off by the bureaucrats as if it had never happened.  All
because something had come and destroying all the research and
releasing the vampires, they were not sure what had done it but they
had a week before they had to report to DC and they were going to
find whoever or whatever had done this.</p>

<p>A group of vampires rapidly made their way through the darkness
towards the campus, they minds were focused on one thing, vengeance.
The blonde vampire in the front smoked a cigarette as he walked, his
mind wasn't focused towards the commandos that had imprisoned him
like the others, but filled with thoughts of the slayer and her
precious little friends.  Oh how they had annoyed him,  he was unable
to do anything about it when he was temporally incapacitated, but now
all that had changed and he had several threats he wished to make
good on.  He had hoped the master would let him go after the slayer,
but that was not the case,  She was the masters.   His face suddenly
developed an evil smirk, yes the master would deal with the slayer
but her friends were another story, he just couldn't decide who
would
be first.  That however would have to wait for the appointed time,
dealing with these commodes would be enough, for now.</p>

<p>Buffy and Angel were patrolling the cemetery  when three vamps jumped
out from behind some headstones and charged at Angel.   Angel
connected with a left hook on the first one to reach him and Buffy
intercepted one of the others and greeted him with a series of quick
punches and jabs.  She then followed it up with a round house kick
that sent him flying backwards.  Angel greeted the third vampire with
a elbow to the chest followed by a leg sweep that put him on the
ground.  Then the first vamp managed to tackle him knocking him to
the ground.  Buffy grabbed a stake and tossed it through the air as
the vampire she had nailed with the round house as he regained his
balance.  The stake was right on target and he instantly turned to
dust.  She saw that Angel was wrestling with one of the vamps on the
ground and that the other one was rushing to help fight him.  She
knocked the vamp down with a forearm accrosed the chest as he ran to
the other vamps aid.  She then produced Mr. Pointy and staked him
before he could get back up.  She looked over in Angels direction
just in time to se the brooding vamp stake his foe.  She helped Angel
up and they resumed their patrol.  As they left the area a figure
seemly stepped out of nowhere and watched as they departed.  Vlad
could hardly believe what he had just witnessed, one of his own had
betrayed their kind and was aiding the slayer.  He clutched his
ancient fist in anger, he had not felt this enraged in centuries.
<This traitor must die and he must die soon>, Vlad`s eyes were
filled
with fury as he walked off in the direction opposite of the way the
slayer and the traitor had went.</p>

<p>The initiative had divided up into eight, five man teams and now was
actively patrolling the campus.  Team one spotted a vampire and had
carefully worked their way to within a hundred yards of him thinking
that he had not noticed them.  They were ready to open fire on him
when the blonde vampire turned around facing them, "Nice of you
to
join us, mates" said Spike.</p>

<p>As he finished the sentence the group was jumped from both sides,
they had been lead into an ambush.  They tried to turn and get a shot
at their attackers but the vamps had to much of a head start on them
and it was over in just a mater of a few quick seconds.</p>

<p>Buffy and Angel had encountered two more vampires as they were
leaving the cemetery to go check out the campus.  Buffy caught one
of  the vamps with a good right cross knocking him to the ground, but
he immediately jumped back up and attacked with a series of jabs and
left hooks.  The slayer blocked each one and connected with the
occasional jab in between the vampires punches.  Angel had ended up
with the weaker of the to vampires,  He blocked the vamps initial
assault and countered with a solid right hook followed by a uppercut
sending his opponent flying backwards into a tombstone, before the
vamp could regain his composer Angel greeted him with a stake to the
chest.  The other vamp and Buffy continued to fight, with neither one
of them making any head way when Buffy managed to get in a leg sweep
sending him to the ground.  She quickly followed up with Mr. Pointy
to the heart, the fight was over.</p>

<p>Team two had just found the remains of team three.  Trying to reach
the others on the radio they quickly discovered that only teams five
and eight were responding.  They stood there as the other two teams
rushed to join them.  What had happened, they had started out the
night to repay their enemy for what had done to the others and now
over half their number had fallen.  The hunters had become the
hunted.  </p>

<p>As team Eight was rushing to their comrades they were ambushed by a
group of vampires from all sides.  One off the commandos got a drop
on a vamp and fired stunning his foe with the burst of energy from
his weapon.  He was getting aim on another one of them when he was
grabbed from behind by a blonde vampire who immediately drained him
of his life, revenge is so very sweet thought Spike as he finished of
the commando.</p>

<p>Buffy and Angel stood their looking at the group of five commandos
that lay on the ground before them, it had been the forth group like
this they had found since they had started their patrol of the
campus.  To make matters even worse they also had found six students
scattered along the way, who had the misfortune of being out and
about in Sunnydale after night fall.  The strangest thing was that
with all these victims they had not seen a single vampire since they
had left the cemetery.  Whoever was doing these attacks on campus was
hitting their targets hard and fast and then moving on.  </p>

<p>"Buffy , I think we have seen enough for tonight."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I think your right."  Buffy paused for a moment,
"Angel, I
don't like this at all.  there is something wrong about the whole
thing"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well the attacks on theses mysterious commandos seems to be
planned.  They were all attacked in areas were they could have been
ambushed and from the looks of things it doesn't look like any of
them got a chance to put up a fight"</p>

<p>"Spike," Said Angel as Buffy nodded in agreement, both of
them
recalling the trouble he had created last time he was on a rampage,
but now it was different, now he was working for Vlad Tepes Dracul.</p>

<p>The ten remaining initiative members stood in a small clearing on the
campus.  They had given up on avenging their friends and were now
waiting for the other team to get there so they could figure out how
they were going to survive the night.  They heard someone approaching
and looked to that direction hoping it was their comrades.  It was
however a vampire that emerged from the darkness, Spike had came
around the corner and was now facing them.  The blonde vamp looked at
the young men and smiled, "We end this now"</p>

<p>Vampires swarmed them from all directions.  Outnumbering them two to
one, the vampires rapidly overran the remaining members of the
imitative, their commander was going to be very much alone in DC.
After the battle was over Spike looked at the others, "Return now
to
the Master, I will be there shortly," He had a gleam in his eye
as he
finished speaking, "I have some friends I need to check up on"</p>

<p>Willow hugged the slayer as soon as she came into the room, she had
spent the last few hours pacing back and forth unable to concentrate
while her love was out on patrol.  Buffy graciously returned the
redheads hug ensuring her that she was fine.  They then walked over
to were they had pushed their tow beds together and sat down.  Willow
laid her head on the slayers shoulder as Buffy gently put her arm
around the redhead.</p>

<p>"I missed you"</p>

<p>"I wasn't gone for that long"</p>

<p>"Yeah but when your out patrolling it seems longer than it really
is"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, I will always make it home to my Wills"</p>

<p>"Promise"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I promise"</p>

<p>"Good because I love you so much," Said Willow as she tilted
her head
towards Buffy leaning in for a kiss.</p>

<p>Outside the dorm stood a blonde vampire smoking a cigarette, as he
watched the two girls through their dorm room Window.  He flicked the
cigarette to the ground putting it out with his boot, then turned
slowly walking back to join the others, this was a very interesting
development,  one the Master would be most interested in.</p>

<p>A week had passed since the vampires had swept through the Sunnydale
campus killing the commandos, and now there was nothing but silence.
The reign of terror had suddenly stopped.  Buffy and Angel hadn't
even come accrosed a single vamp on their patrol for that last six
days, which made Willow both happy but at the same time she was all
the more worried about her new lover.  If the vamps were not out and
about that met that Buffy wouldn't have to fight them, risking
injury or worse.  However she also realized that with the recent
events that this was most likely a calm before the storm, so she did
what she had been doing every night while Buffy was out,  She paced
in their room saying a silent prayer to the Goddess for Buffy`s
safe return.</p>

<p>Xander and Anya had just been dropped off at his place and he was
searching through his jeans for the house key, when a figure stepped
around the corner of the house.</p>

<p>"Do you remember what I said I would do to you when I was my old
self again" Spike said as he stepped up onto the porch and began
walking towards the two of them with two other vampires in tow.</p>

<p>Xander protectively stepped between Spike and Anya as she struggled
to get the door open.  Spike took a swing at Xander which he managed
to block only to get sent flying off the porch into the yard by a
second punch he never saw coming.  Spike then stepped off the porch
and made his way over to Xander, kicking him in the chest as he was
getting up off of the ground.  He then grabbed Xander by the collar
lifting him up so they were face to face.  "It's payback
time" Said the blond vampire before He threw the boy accrosed the
yard.</p>

<p>Anya was helpless, the two vampires that had followed Spike onto the
porch immediately had grabbed her when Spike began his assault on
Xander.  They weren't doing anything to her just holding her so
she couldn't get away as Spike thrashed her boyfriend. </p>

<p>Buffy had just arrived back at their room to find Willow wasn't
there, she was starting to panic when she saw a note from Willow
saying that her computer had crashed and she was using the one in the
lounge.  Buffy started to walk down the hallway towards the student
lounge on their floor when she heard a scream.  She broke into a full
sprint rushing down the hallway the instant she heard the plea for
help, the voice she had heard was defiantly Willows.</p>

<p>Buffy burst through the door and into the student lounge, Willow was
trapped in the far corner of the room by Riley and another
vampire.  "GET AWAY FROM HER!" shouted the slayer at the top
of her lungs as she charged the vampire closest to her.  The vamp had
spun around just to see the slayers fist connect with his face.
Buffy followed up with a quick leg sweep, and staked him with Mr.
Pointy before he even hit the ground.  She then turned all her
attention to Riley.  He slowly stepped away from the corner that
Willow was cowering in, cautiously eyeing the slayer.  </p>

<p>"How dare you even think of hurting my Willow," Buffy snapped
at Riley as she connected with a solid kick to his chest sending him
flying into a wall.  As he bounced off of the wall she connected with
a knee to the abdomen causing the vampire to bend over.  She the
connected with a kick to the head, then a round house , laying him
flat on his back on the lounge floor.  Before the vampire Riley could
get up the slayer came down on top of his chest with a elbow drop.
Buffy then began to repeatedly strike him in the face with all her
strength shouting , "No body messes with My Willow," with
each punch. After about twenty or so punches she produced Mr. Point
and rammed it into Riley reducing him to ashes.  </p>

<p>Buffy jumped up and ran over to Willow.  Kneeling down beside the
redhead she quickly examined her to ensure the vampires had not
harmed her.  The slayer then took her lover in her arms and pulled
her up against her as they sat cuddling in the corner of the lounge.</p>

<p>"Are you alright" Asked Buffy as she slowly rocked back and
forth with Willow in her arms.</p>

<p>"I'm fine now" Replied Willow as she placed her head on
the slayers shoulder.</p>

<p>Xander Woke up finding himself laying face down in the yard, every
muscle in his body ached and it took everything he had just to stand
up, but as soon as he got to his feet a sharp pain shot through his
left leg and he immediately fell back to the ground in agony
clutching his leg.   He looked to the porch to see the door was still
shut and that Anya was missing, a wave of dread swept over him, <what
had they done with Her.>  He began to pull himself along the ground
slowly etching his way towards the porch, ignoring the pain that was
racing through his body, his mind was focused on one thing, Anya.</p>

<p>Angel was about five blocks from Giles house when ten vampires lead
by Spike stepped out in front of him from an Alley.  Spike looked
Angel dead in the eyes, "I have someone to introduce you to soul
boy" </p>

<p>"Yeah, and who might that be," Inquired Angel as he tried to
gauge his situation.</p>

<p> "Angel meet Vlad Tepes Dracul,"  As Spike finished his
sentence the vampires behind him parted in the middle and the blonde
vamp stepped off to the side.  Angel was now standing face to face
with the Master Vampyre.</p>

<p>Vlad looked directly into Angel's eyes, "By the time I am done
with you, you will wish that you had remained in hell"</p>

</table>

<p>Angel awoke, every inch of his body ached,  slowly he became aware of
his surroundings.  He tried to break free of the chains that held him
to the wall, but he was unable to do so.  The events of last night
that brought him here were a blur,  he remembered encountering Vlad
Tepes and Spike and fighting with them, but pass that everything was
hazy.  The last thing he could recall was being knocked to the ground
by Vlad only to have something very heavy strike him in the head,
after that he only remembered a few moments ago when he woke up.  He
continued to struggle trying to break free of the chains but he
couldn't, that's when he noticed her.  Accrosed the room from
him were a series of  makeshift cages, all of them were empty except
one that held a very terrified Anya.</p>

<p>Giles paced back in forth in the waiting room of the trauma center,
the worry clearly showing on his face.  What happened last night, He
thought to himself.  First there was the call from Buffy that Willow
had been attacked but was O.K., Then came a call from Xander that
Spike had attacked him and taken Anya.  That had been several hours
ago and now he was at the hospital with Buffy and Willow, the three
of them waiting for Xander to get out of surgery.  He was a nervous
wreck, he had always looked at the group as if they were his own
children and now two of them had been attacked, putting one of them
in the hospital.  Then to make matters even worse the sun had been up
for a few hours and Angel had never made it back. He was still trying
to piece together everything that had transpired last night, but one
thing was for sure Vlad Tepes had made his move.</p>

<p>Back at Giles place Wesley and Quentin were going through every book
they had at their disposal, they had to find something that would aid
the slayer.  The problem was the same one they had encountered from
the beginning of all of this, there simply were no prophecies on Vlad
Tepes Dracul, and besides the normal way of killing vampires there
were no hints on how to defeat him.  Every account they could find of
were a slayer or someone from the council faced him had the same
result, the Master Vampyre had won.  Both of them knew that they had
to come up with something soon, before any more of the group aiding
the slayer fell prey to the Master Vampyre.  As the two of them
continued to muddle through their books Megan sat of in a corner in a
trance, she was once again trying to reach out with her mind, to try
and learn something of Vlad Tepes and his plans.  As she did this
Cordelia sat alone on the couch, she had wanted to go to the hospital
with the others but she couldn't bring herself to leave the
house.  She was hoping by some miracle Angel would make it back there
or at least call, but deep inside her she knew that it was only
wishful thinking.</p>

<p>Angel was talking with Anya, so far he had been able to determine
that she had not been hurt but Spike had done a number on Xander.
However their conversation was interrupted when Vlad and Spike walked
into the room.  Spike walked over to the fire place and started a
fire, as Vlad walked over in front of Angel slapping him hard
accross the face when he got there.</p>

<p>He then looked at Angel, "How dare you betray your brethren, I
shall teach you the price of such treachery"</p>

<p>Vlad then walked over to the fire place and pulled a long sword from
the mantle, he proceeded to stick its blade into the flames.  Turning
towards Angel as he held the weapon in the fire, "Shall we
begin"</p>

<p>Buffy had her armed wrapped around the redhead who had leaned up
against her shoulder and fallen asleep in the waiting room.  The
slayer motioned for Giles to come over and have a seat next to them,
and he obliged.</p>

<p>"What is it Buffy"</p>

<p>The slayers eyes filled with sadness as she spoke, "They almost
got her last night."</p>

<p>"But they didn't, you stopped them before they could harm
her"</p>

<p>"What what if I was a few seconds later, What then", a tear
rolled down the slayers cheek as she finished speaking, even the
thought of something happening to Willow hurt her.</p>

<p>Giles could see what the blonde was going through and tried to
comfort her, "It didn't happen that way, she is here with you
and she is safe.  Don't let yourself get caught up in what if
this
happened."</p>

<p>"I can't help it, I love her so much, I don't know what I
would do if something ever happened," Buffy was starting to cry,
and
Giles put his hand on her shoulder in a effort to comfort his
surrogate daughter.</p>

<p>He then looked at the slayer, "I want the two of you to come stay
at my place with the rest of us until this is over,  she will be
safer there, after all it is much harder for a vampire to get into a
house than it is a dorm."</p>

<p>Buffy looked at her watcher and smiled, "Thanks."</p>

<p>Buffy then looked over at her love, she leaned her head up against
the redhead and softly spoke, "Don't worry Wills, I won't let
anyone hurt you"</p>

<p>Angel screamed out in pain as Vlad once again ran the red hot blade
accrosed his chest barely cutting into the top layer of skin.  This
had been going on for over an hour now and Angel's chest was
covered with a series of rather nasty slash marks complete with third
degree burns that the red hot sword had caused.  The master Vampyre
paused for a second and looked at Spike, "William you know what
the best part of this is"</p>

<p>"Hearing him scream" Replied the blonde vampire.</p>

<p>A smiling Vlad replied, "No, it is amusing to hear this traitors
cries of pain but I think the best part is that I can do this forever
and he won`t die from it," when he had finished speaking he
once again ran the burning blade accrosed the traitors chest as his
victim screamed out in anguish.</p>

<p>Giles was getting back up to start pacing the room again when a nurse
walked in, "Excuse me are you the ones here for Alexander
Harris"</p>

<p>Buffy softly shook Willow easing her out of her sleep as Giles
answered the Nurse, "Yes, is He O.K.? Can we see him?"</p>

<p>The nurse walked over to them and motioned for Giles to sit down.  He
took a seat on the couch next to Buffy and waited for the nurses
answer.</p>

<p>"He has been injured pretty bad, but the doctors expect him to
make a full recovery.  It however is going to take a while for that
to happen and he will need your help while he recovers.  I should
warn you before you go see him, the injuries he sustained were
serious and he might not look like his usual self"</p>

<p>"How bad is he," Questioned Giles his voice showing all the
concern of a worried parent.</p>

<p>"His left leg is broken in three places, and there is a hairline
fracture on his hip.  Three ribs were broken and the rest of them
bruised, His right shoulder has been dislocated and the Right arm
broken.  Also he is covered with bruises, and has some swelling in
the facial area along with a broken jaw, so he will not be able to
talk that much for awhile,"  The nurse paused for a second to
let
the information sink in and then she continued, "There was some
internal bleeding but the doctors were able to stop that.  All of
this has put him in a great deal of pain, so he is heavily medicated
right now.  I'm going to take you to see him, but you can only
stay
for a few minutes and he will be fairly much incoherent"</p>

<p>Megan jumped up out of the corner and rushed over to the table that
Quentin and Wesley were doing their research at. "I had a vision,
I saw the Master Vampyre"</p>

<p>Both of them men immediately stopped what they were doing and gave
Megan their full attention.  Quentin looked at her, "What was it
that you saw?"</p>

<p>"I saw the missing vampire that had been helping us, He is in
great pain.  I believe that Vlad Tepes is torturing him.  I also
saw
the girl that was taken, she is being held inside some kind of
cage."</p>

<p>"Was there anything else" Quentin questioned.</p>

<p>"Yes, everything then faded and I saw Vlad Tepes standing over
you laughing"</p>

<p>Vlad had been torturing him for hours now,  his pain was so great
that it even hurt to breath.  Angel wasn't sure how much more he
could take, he silently wished that his tormentor would just end it
and kill him.  Angel watched as Vlad had put the long sword up and
produced a dagger from his belt, "Well I see that you survived
round one, lets see how you deal with this," snarled Vlad his
voice
laced with hate for the traitor.</p>

<p>Vlad then walked over to Angel and looked over the vampires body.
His chest and abdomen were covered with the slash marks that had made
over the last couple of hours.  Vlad Smiled as he took the dagger and
rammed it into Angels left shoulder.  Spike then walked over carrying
a large silver tray that had a cloth draped over it.  The blonde
vampire sat it down next to Vlad, who removed the cover revealing the
twenty daggers that laid upon the tray.  Vlad grabbed one of them and
Angel howled out in pain as the dagger was rammed it into his other
shoulder.  Vlad then looked at Angel, "Two down, nineteen to
go", He then turned  at Spike as he picked up a dagger, "Take
the
girl's cage to another room, I am growing tired of her
sobbing"</p>

<p>Anya sat trembling in her cage, she could no longer see what was
happening to Angel from the room Spike had pushed her cell into, but
she still could hear his cries.  She was terrified by what she had
witnessed, even as a vengeance demon she had rarely seen torture of
that magnitude.  She feared that when he was done with Angel that she
would be next, she curled up in a ball in a corner of the cage, her
body still trembling and continued to weep.</p>

<p>Giles and the two girls had just returned from the hospital, and
given the group a report on Xander's condition, then a rather shaken
up Quentin briefed them on what Megan had seen, his voice filled with
anxiety as he mentioned her vision of his own demise.  The Slayer
then walked over to the table and looked at the council members and
turned to Giles, "It's going to be dark soon, I had better
get ready for patrol"</p>

<p>As soon as Buffy spoke Willow jumped up from her chair and rushed to
the slayers side wrapping both her arms around the blonde.
Desperation filled her eyes as she looked at Giles, "You
can't let her go out, not after what happened last night.  She
doesn't have anyone to help her now," pleaded the redhead.</p>

<p>Giles turned and faced Quentin, "She's right, slayer or not,
We can't allow Buffy to go out there by herself with Vlad Tepes
and
his vampires roaming around"</p>

<p>Quentin looked at the slayer then to Giles, "I tend to agree, but
we just can't sit around and wait for him to come to us, what
would
you suggest"</p>

<p>"I'll go with her.  After all, My magic is coming along
rather nicely,"  Piped in Willow.  She was terrified at the
aspect of
going out with Dracul running around, but there was no way she was
going to let Buffy go out there alone.</p>

<p>"No you won't," Responded Buffy as she hugged Willow ,
"There is no way I am going to allow you to go out there.  I
couldn't
go on if anything were to happen to you.  I need you here, where I
know your safe." </p>

<p>Giles looked at the two of them and then spoke, "I'll go."</p>

<p>Before anyone could respond Wesley spoke up, "So will I"</p>

<p>Quentin looked at Wesley and Giles, "Then it is decided, Giles
and Wesley arm yourselves up.  You're going on patrol with the
slayer."</p>

<p>Angel had daggers protruding all up and down his arms and legs, one
of the daggers had been completely run through his right hand.  The
vampire was now openly weeping from the immense pain that racked
through his body, as he pleaded with the Master vampyre to kill him.  </p>

<p>Vlad held the remaining dagger in his hand and turned to
Spike, "William I am having to much fun with this.  I believe I
will stay in tonight, but I need to test the slayer.  Send out some
of my children to attack her, tell them that if she starts to get the
upper hand, which I feel she will, that they are to retreat.  Also
could you send someone out to grab me something to eat, preferably
someone young and have them to get something for you too"</p>

<p>"As you wish Master," said the blonde vamp, "I take it
you wish for me to stay here."</p>

<p>"Yes, I wish to talk with you about what we are going to do to
capture the redheaded witch you told me about," as soon as Vlad
had finished speaking he turned away from Spike and rammed the last
dagger through Angels other hand resulting in another plea for death
from the traitor.</p>

<p>The three of them walked through the cemetery.  Buffy was in front as
Giles and Wesley followed, Giles was armed with a crossbow and Wesley
carried two super soakers filled with holy water. As soon as they
turned the corner into the first cemetery on their list of places to
patrol six vamps jumped out in front of them.  Giles let loose with
the crossbow turning one to dust and immediately began to reload.  </p>

<p>Wesley opened fire hitting a vamp, sending him screaming to the
ground.   Buffy instantly attacked, connecting a roundhouse on
one vamp and caching another with a leg sweep.  She then dropped to her
knees staking the vamp she got with the leg sweep and dusting him.  </p>

<p>The other vamp then jumped on her back before she could get back up
only to be hit with a barrage of holy water from Wesley.  Giles then
fired his crossbow at one of the vamps but missed his mark.  As Buffy
took up a fighting stance the two remaining vamps looked at one
another and ran away.  The slayer looked at the two men, "Well I
never had them run away like that before."</p>

<p>The others sat there watching Willow as she paced back and forth
accross the room saying her prayers to the Goddess on Buffy`s
behalf, they had somewhat of an idea of what she was going through,
they too were all worried about the slayer, Giles, and Wesley.  They
also knew that the feelings of concern that swept over them were
nothing to what the redhead was going through, sure they cared about
the group that was out patrolling and hoped for their safe return,
but she was in love with the slayer and at night in the Hellsmouth
that could be a very hard thing to deal with, especially knowing that
the master vampyre was also out there.</p>

<p>They were just finishing the patrol of the first cemetery when
Buffy's slayer senses kicked in.  She alerted the others and the
three of them took up fighting stances.  Four vampires were
approaching from the left and Wesley took aim at them, as Giles
pointed a loaded crossbow towards the seven vampires coming from the
right.  Giles fired and hit a vamp reducing him to ash as Wesley
managed to get two of them with the super soakers.  The vamps
immediately rushed in for the attack ignoring the two men and
concentrating on the slayer.  Buffy leg swept the first one that got
there only to be grabbed by two others. Using them as support she
lifted herself up off the ground and kicked a vamp that was in front
of her square in the face sending him reeling backwards to the
ground. She then stomped on one of the vamps foot as hard as she
could, and when she did he let go of her.  She then flipped the other
vamp to the ground and staked him as soon as he hit.  The vamp whose
foot she had trampled on lunged at her but she gracefully rolled out
of his way causing him to miss and land face first on the ground, and
staked him from behind before he could react.  A vampire grabbed her
from behind as she got back up, the slayer broke his grip  and spun
around sweeping his legs out from under him only to get hit from
behind by another vamp who was staked by Giles before he could do any
more damage.  As soon as Buffy hit the ground she was back up but so
was the vamp that she had previously knocked down.  Before she could
fight him he was hit from behind by a well aimed shot of holy water.
Buffy then turned her attention towards the remaining  four vampires
only to see them running away.</p>

<p>"Are you alright," Asked Giles, wanting to make sure the
slayer wasn't hurt by the blow to the head she had taken.</p>

<p>"Yeah, it's just a bump.  How about you two"</p>

<p>"Were fine they seemed not to be concerned with us at all,"
Giles responded trying to figure out why Wesley and himself were
ignored and while for the second time tonight vampires had run from
them.</p>

<p>Four vampires entered the mansion dragging two  young girls from
the
Sunnydale campus with them.  Vlad who had just removed the last
dagger from Angel looked at Spike, "William, it looks like our
dinners here"</p>

<p>After the two of them had feed Vlad looked at Spike, "So the
Slayer and the redheaded witch are in love"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Spike glad that the master vampyre seemed
very happy with the information he had given him.</p>

<p>"Then she will be the key to turning the slayer."</p>

<p>"Master, You wish to turn the slayer," Spikes voice was
filled with confusion over his master statement, usually they just
killed the slayers, if they could.</p>

<p>"I see you are puzzled, let me explain.  If I kill her another
will be called, then another.  It never ends, I spent over a hundred
and twenty years killing slayers and watchers only to have more pop
up.  However a slayer can only be called when the current one dies,
so by turning her no replacement will come."</p>

<p>"I see Master, but  I must tell you that by some sort of accident
there is a second slayer"</p>

<p>"I am aware of that.  Correct me if I am wrong but the second
slayer is in a comma"</p>

<p>"You're correct, Master"</p>

<p>"Then we will ensure she stays that way and allow her to die of
natural causes, by then it will be to late,  with no slayer to stand
in our way we will have overrun the world ," Vlad paused for a
second, "Now back to the witch"</p>

<p>They were headed back towards Giles house after having been attacked
three other times by various groups of vampires.  Both the men had a
few bumps and bruises, but Buffy had several scratch marks and was
bruised all over mainly because of one thing, each of the attacks
followed the same pattern as the first two.  The vampires would
concentrate on Buffy, ignoring Giles and Wesley and as soon as they
started to win the fight the remaining vampires would flee.  When
Giles finally put together what was happening he decided that it was
best to get back to the house as soon as they could, the vampires
were attacking like that for a reason.  One to try and weaken the
slayer and two to gauge her fighting skills and report back to Vlad
Tepes.  </p>

<p>They were about a quarter of a mile from the house when three
vampires jumped out from some nearby bushes and instantly converged
on the slayer.  Giles aimed his crossbow but couldn't get a clean
shot without risking hitting Buffy.   Buffy did a side kick
knocking
one vamp back and blocked a powerful right swing from the second
one.  The third one grabbed her from behind and Wesley went to fire
his super soaker at the vamp only to discover he was out of holy
water.  Buffy kicked the second vamp in the face knocking him down as
the first vamp was getting back up.  She then elbowed the third vamp
in the lower ribs breaking his grip.  She grabbed the third vamp by
the head and flipped him to the ground staking him as soon as he
hit.  That's when she felt the foot of the first vamp connect with
her jaw knocking her flat on the back.  As the vamp leaped on top of
her she produced Mr. Pointy, and when he landed the vamp impaled
himself on her stake and turned to ashes.  She then flipped back up
and barely managed to side step the remaining vampires charge.  As
the vamp spun around after having run passed her he was greeted with
Mr. Pointy to the heart.  The three of them then left the area and
continued back towards Giles house.  After they were gone a vampire
who had been hiding the whole time emerged from the bushes and rushed
back towards the mansion to report what he had seen to his
master.</p>

<p>Willow stood there gazing at the Slayer as she limped over to the
couch and took a seat, her body was covered with cuts and bruises,
her cloths were torn in several places and stained with blood from
the cuts that lay beneath them.   Willow rushed to her lovers
side as
tears freely flowed down her cheeks, <what had the night done to the
girl who was her entire world.>  Willow gently wrapped Buffy in her
arms as she slid onto the couch next her.  The redhead looked into
her loves eyes and she could see the toll that this whole ordeal was
taking on the chosen one.  Buffy looked broken, her eyes were filled
with the emotions that were tearing at her soul.  The fear of
something happening to Willow, The uncertainty of if she was capable
of defeating Vlad and his minions, these emotions along with the pain
that coursed through her body from tonight's struggle, had  left her
feeling alone and Empty.  Willow saw all of this when she looked into
Buffy's eyes, and it made her heart want to break.  She softly
kissed her love on the cheek and helped her off the couch announcing
that they were going up stairs so she could tend to Buffy's
injuries.</p>

<p>"Giles, Wesley.  What happened?" Quentin inquired his face
clearly showing his concern.</p>

<p>It was Giles who responded, "We were attacked by several groups
of vampires throughout the entire patrol.  Each time they
concentrated on the slayer practically ignoring us.  As soon as we
would start to win they would flee."</p>

<p>Quentin studied the look on Giles face, "There's more, isn't
there"</p>

<p>"They were trying to weaken her, but at the same time test her,
looking for any weakness that they could report to Vlad Tepes."</p>

<p>Quentin got up from his chair and made his way over to Giles phone,
<it was two in the morning here so that made it eight in the morning
in England.>  He knew what he had to do, "Giles I'm calling
back to the council and have them gather every watcher and slayer in
training they can get together in the next few hour and get them on a
plane here as soon as possible, hopefully they will arrive before
night fall, it would appear that  Vlad Tepes is a bigger threat than
we thought," With that said he picked up the phone and began to
dial.</p>

<p>Buffy was lying on the bed wearing the clean cloths Willow had gotten
for her, the redhead witch had already cleaned and bandaged her
wounds and was now casting a series of healing spells to aid the
slayers healing ability.  In-between each of the incantations Willow
would softly kiss Buffy on the lips and tell her how much she loved
her and how important she was to all of them.  As Willow did this the
slayer softly wept tears of happiness, in the presence of her true
love she could feel her doubts, and fears slowly fade away, giving
way to the love she had for Willow.  </p>

<p>Wesley and Megan sat at the table talking as Quentin was on the phone
with England making the final arrangements to get help for the
slayer, the council could have ten watchers and six slayers in
training here, they just hoped they would arrive before another night
once again came to Sunnydale.  </p>

<p>Giles walked over to the chair that Cordelia was sitting in, he could
tell that she had been crying, and the emotional turmoil she was
going through showed on her face.  The watcher kneeled next to the
chair and put his hand on her shoulder, "Care to talk about
it"</p>

<p>Cordelia's voice filled with sorrow as she spoke, "He's
being tortured, Megan saw it in her vision.  Angel doesn`t
deserve
that, He`s done so much for me.  He showed me that I can stand
on
my
own, that I can be more than I ever hoped to be."</p>

<p>Cordelia had to stop and regain her composer and let out a fresh
series of tears.  Giles knew that their was nothing he really could
say to ease what she was going through, all he could do was be there
for her and listen, so that is what he did.  After a few minutes
passed she was able to continue, "At first he was my boss, but he
has become much more than that to me, He is the best friend I ever
had.  He saw past the mask I wore throughout high school and helped
me to remove it for good.  I don't know were I would be without
him,
and I don't know what will happen to me if we can't save
him"</p>

<p>Tears once again filled Cordelia's eyes as she began to weep,
Giles
softly patted her on the shoulder , "Cordelia, we will save
Angel," Giles said in a comforting voice trying to ease her pain,
but
deep down in his heart he wondered if that was a promise he would be
able to keep.</p>

<p>Angel hung from the chains that held him prisoner, his head hung down
as he softly wept.  He was in constant agony from the damage Vlad
Tepes had brought upon his vampiric body, though he never before
considered himself religious he now prayed to the Gods to end his
suffering and allow him to die, he had given up, in his mind their
was no hope for escape from the Master Vampyre.</p>

<p>Vlad Tepes and Spike had been listening to the various reports from
the vampires he had sent out.  The slayer was even stronger than he
had first suspected, for the first time in centuries he was one again
was becoming excited at the thought of battle.   She was going to
be
a challenge to turn, but he had every confidence that once he had the
witch within his grasp, the slayer would follow.  After all
humanities down fall was that they got so wrapped up in their love
that they lost sight of there surroundings, and when that happened to
the slayer he would strike.</p>

<p>Cordelia tossed and turned in her sleep, visions of Angel's
suffering filled her mind and tore at her heart.  Then the images of
her friend began to fade, she found herself standing in a unfamiliar
place.  She was somewhere and nowhere at the same time,  darkness
surrounded her and it appeared that she was completely alone, up
ahead was a bright light so she began to walk towards it as a voice
softly beckoned to her, "Come."</p>

<p>It seemed that she had been walking towards the light forever and
just when she thought she would never reach it, she was there.
Slowly she stepped into the light and found herself standing before
the Oracles of The Powers That Be.  They looked at her and
spoke, "That which makes Vlad strong is also his weakness, for
the slayer to defeat him she must use it against him."  </p>

<p>Before she could ask them what they met everything began to fade,
then she awoke.  Cordelia jumped up and rushed to Giles bedroom and
began pounding on the door.  When a groggy Giles opened it she yelled
at him, "We need to talk now."</p>

<p>Willow and Buffy laid side by side snuggled up against one another
sound asleep.  They had talked for over an hour after Willow had
treated the slayers injuries.  Willow had held Buffy in her arms
easing her anguish, and with unconditional love taken away the
negative emotions that were dragging Buffy down.  The magic and the
slayer abilities would heal her wounds, but it was Willow who had sat
there by her side and healed her soul.  In her lovers embrace Buffy
had found the confidence that Vlad had been slowly taking away, and
she realized that the feeling of emptiness and of being alone was
only an illusion her mind had created, as long as Willow was there
she would never be alone.  As Buffy drifted off to sleep she felt
that she could win against Vlad if but for one reason, she had
Willow.</p>

<p>As the two girls slept and the predawn sky began to cover Sunnydale,
the Goddess looked down from the forever at the two girls and spoke
to Willow in her dreams, "Fear not faithful Wicca, We have heard
your pleas and are with you and the Chosen One"</p>
