<p>They had spent the majority of the day talking about
Cordelia’s vision from The Powers That Be and the
voice that Willow had heard in her sleep, they tried
to piece the meanings of these messages together,
only to realize just how cryptic The Powers That Be
are.  One thing however was for certain, they knew
that they had little time to learn what the messages
met, They knew that when night fell it would bring the
Master Vampyre and his children of the night.  </p>

<p>Giles paced the room, “Vlad Tepes power is rumored to
come from the darkness that cloaked his soul in life
but how can we use that against him?”  The rest of the
group looked at the watcher as he spoke and shook
their heads, no one knew the answer to the question
that was plaguing them all.</p>

<p>Angel howled out in pain as Vlad ran a hot poker
accrosed his cheek, “So traitor do you still wish to
die”</p>

<p>A greatly weakened Angel was barely able to responded
to his tormentor, “Yes,” he sobbed.</p>

<p>“To bad, I am enjoying myself way to much,” replied
Vlad with a huge grin on his face and then made
another pass with the hot poker as Spike walked into
the room.</p>

<p>“Master, what is on our agenda for tonight,” replied
the Blonde vamp, eager for some action.</p>

<p>“Tonight William, we get me the Witch”</p>

<p>It now was just a few short hours till the sunset
came, Giles and Wesley were talking to Quentin
developing two game plans; one for if their help got
here before night fall and another if they didn’t.
Megan sat in a chair next to Cordelia trying to help
her interpret the vision she had had but so far she
had not gotten any further than the rest of the group
why did The Powers That Be have to be so cryptic she
thought to herself.  As all of this happened Buffy
laid on the couch her head resting on Willows lap as
the redhead reassured her they would find a way to
defeat Vlad</p>

<p>The doorbell rang and Giles got up and went to answer
it.  When he did all he could say was, “Thank the Gods
your here,”  The other Watchers and the Slayers in
training had made it and with very little time to
spare, the sun had begun to sink into the west.  The
group from England was quickly briefed on the
situation and given the plan of attack for tonight.
There was going to be two patrols, one for each side
of town.  Buffy would lead one patrol with Giles, four
other watchers and two of the slayers in training.
Wesley was going to be in charge of the second  one
that was made up of the remaining six watchers and
four slayers in training.</p>

<p>Vlad looked out the window to the darkness that now
filled the night , He took a broad sword and rammed it
through Angels abdomen so hard that it embedded itself
into the concrete wall behind the traitor as he cried
out in agony.  Vlad then walked over to Spike and the
fifty other vampires that now filled the room, “Shall
we begin”</p>

<p> Wesley’s  team turned into a cemetery that was about
a mile from Giles house, So far so good thought the
council member as they made their way into the heart
of the cemetery.  They had been out a half hour and
had seen no signs of vampires, but that did little to
ease the tension that filled their being.  They knew
that the enemy was coming, they just didn’t know when.</p>

<p>Then it happened, ten vampires popped up from behind
the tombstones they had been hiding behind, and
another twenty came from the mausoleum to the groups
left.  The Slayers in training all produced stakes and
took up fighting stances, as the watchers came out
with crossbows.  Then a figure stepped out of the
darkness.  He wore all black except for a golden seal
on his chest that bore the image of a dragon, “Allow
me to introduce myself, I am Vlad Tepes Dracul”</p>

<p>One of the watchers fired a stake at the master
Vampyre only to have Vlad pick it out of the air, “Now
that was a very foolish thing to do.  Kill them,”
snared Vlad.</p>

<p>The vampires rushed the group as the other watchers
let go with their crossbows, unfortunately none of
them were as good as a shot as Giles, only four
managed to hit their intended targets before the
vampires were upon them.  A vampire grabbed one of the
watchers as he tried to reload his crossbow and
snapped his neck.  He then turned his attention to
another watcher who managed to get a shot off only to
have it hit the vamp in the shoulder barely missing
its mark.  The vampire yanked the stake out from his
shoulder and rammed it with all of his strength
through the watchers heart dropping him to the ground.</p>

<p>One of the slayers in training had just staked a
vampire and turned to fight a second only to find
herself face to face with Vlad.  He grabbed her by the
throat lifting her up off of the ground.  The slayer
in training’s body began to shake as the master
vampyre tightened his grip.  Another slayer in
training who saw what was happening broke from the
vampire she was fighting and rushed to help the other
girl.  Vlad caught her in with his other hand and
lifted her up into the air by the throat and began to
strangle both the slayers in training.  On of the
watchers seeing that Vlad literally had both of his
hands full took aim with his crossbow, just as he
fired a vampire leapt in front of his master
sacrificing himself.</p>

<p>Buffy sailed through the air landing in front of a
vampire that was getting ready to finish of a badly
wounded slayer in training.  The vamp took a swing at
her but she caught his arm and flipped him to the
ground.  She then produced Mr. Pointy and dusted her
foe.  Another vamp jumped her from behind only to be
kicked in the back by a slayer in training named
Kathryn.  The enraged vamped spun around to attack the
girl and as he did Buffy staked him from behind.
Three more vampires converged on the two girls taking
caution in approaching them  Giles took aim with his
crossbow and took out on of the vamps then turned his
attention to helping the two remaining watchers in the
group as the y tried to fend off four vampires.</p>

<p>Vlad grabbed a slayer in training off the top of one
of his children as she was preparing to stake him, and
snapped her spine like it was a twig.  He then ripped
a crossbow from a nearby watchers arm and broke it in
half, then proceeded to feed off of him while his
children encircled Wesley who now found himself very
much alone against ten vampires.  </p>

<p>Buffy stood there looking at the others, the twenty
vamps that had attacked them were gone but only Giles,
Kathryn, a badly wounded slayer in training named
Tristin, and herself remained.  She looked over to
Giles, “Now what do we do,” she asked in desperation.</p>

<p>“I think it’s time to go find the other group and head
back to the house”, replied the watcher.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door, and Quentin went to
answer it.  As he opened the door he saw Wesley laying
on the porch not moving , and without thinking he
rushed outside to help the young council member.  He
knelt down and felt for a pulse but could not find
any.  As Quentin turned back into the house to let
them know he was dead Megan screamed in horror.  The
older council member spun around only to come face to
face with a vamped out Wesley.  The former council
member grabbed him and threw him to the ground  as
Vlad and Spike walked onto the porch leaving seven
other vampires in Giles front yard.  Vlad grabbed
Quentin by the back of the neck and lifted him up,
“Send out the witch and I will allow you all to live
for now.”</p>

<p>Quentin managed to gather inner strength that he
didn’t even know he had, “Were not turning anyone over
to you”</p>

<p>Vlad looked into the house and saw Willow standing
there, trembling from the fear that he had come for
her.  The master Vampyre smiled at her and it sent a
cold shiver down the redheads spine.  He then looked
at Megan and Cordelia before he turned his eyes to the
man that was now within his grasp, “So be it,” Vlad
said as he nodded to Spike.  The blonde vamp then
produced a Molotov cocktail, set it ablaze, then
tossed it through the open door, as Vlad sunk his
teeth into Quentin draining every last drop of blood
from his body, then laughing like a madman as he
dropped his cold victim to the ground.</p>

<p>Buffy and her group had searched the area Wesley was
suppose to be patrolling only to discover that they
had been wiped out and that Wesley was missing.  A
sense of dread over came Buffy and panic filled her
face.  “I have got to get to Willow”  Shouted Buffy as
she took off into the night, leaving Giles and the
others behind.</p>

<p>The three women rushed to the back off the house as
the living room burst into flames.  They made it to
the back door only to find ten vampires waiting there
for them.  One of the vamps threw a blazing Molotov
cocktail into the kitchen as the girls retreated out
of the room.  They were in sheer panic, both the exits
were blocked by vampires and the fire from the
vampires Molotov cocktails was rapidly spreading
through the house.  They did the only thing they could
and rushed down stairs to the basement.  Once they got
there Willow opened the metal door to the storage room
and the three of them rushed inside, locking the door
behind them.  Willow then sat down on the cold
concrete floor and began to chant.</p>

<p>“Beloved Goddess of the silver moon!<br>
Mistress of mysteries-Queen of the sea!<br>
I call upon thee in ancient names-<br>
Artemis, Cerridwenn, Hecate!</p>

<p>Beloved sister of the hidden wood!<br>
Child enchantress-Star of the night!<br>
I call upon thee of the untamed wilds-<br>
Descend with your laughter and secret delight!</p>

<p>Beloved Mother of the ageless womb,<br>
From which the many worlds, at once, were born!<br>
I call upon thee of the gentle Earth-<br>
From whose breast, and whose belly our bounty is<br>
shorn!</p>

<p>Beloved wisewoman, spinner of fates!<br>
Weaver of dreamwebs-bearer of death!<br>
I call upon thee of the waning skies-<br>
Grant me your vision and open my eyes!</p>

<p>Goddess I ask thee to live within me!<br>
Grant me your knowing, and show me to see!<br>
Lend me your wisdom and love for all things;<br>
Goddess of magick, I call unto thee!</p>

<p>Artemis, Cerridwenn, Hecate!<br>
Artemis, Cerridwenn, Hecate!”</p>

<p>Buffy could see the flames off in the distance and she
began to run even faster towards the house, every
fiber of her being  told her that Willow was in danger
and that she had to get to her as fast as she could.
The slayer was running with all of her might when
seven vampires rushed out onto the road in front of
her blocking the way.  “I don’t have time for this,”
shouted the slayer as she produced Mr. Point and
attacked the vampires.</p>

<p>Anya had managed to finally pick the lock to the cage
that had become her prison.  Quietly she crawled out
of it and made her way to were Angel was being held.
She slowly peeked around the corner to see four
vampires sitting at a table and another two laying out
several ice picks on a table that was next to Angel.
She had to cover her mouth to keep from gasping in
horror when she saw the brooding vamp.  His body was
covered with slashes, stab wounds, and severe burns.
A large sword had been driven through his abdomen were
it still remained and they had placed a crown of
thorns on his head that was piercing into his scull.
She knew that there was no way she could save him,
Vlad had left to many vampires there to stand guard.
Silently she made her way back into the other room and
crept towards the back door, as soon as she got there
she burst through it an began running towards Giles as
fast as her legs could carry her, screaming out in
terror the whole way.</p>

<p>Buffy fought as she had never fought before, her mind
was focused on one thing, finishing off the vamps and
getting to Willow.  The slayer used every skill she
could call upon and fought with a fury her attackers
had never seen before, the blonde rammed Mr. Pointy
into the heart of one vamp, then caught another with a
left hook sending him reeling backwards.  She then did
a round house knocking a third vamp to the ground,
following up with Mr. Pointy she reduced him to dust.
Two other vamps went to attack her from behind, but
she stayed low to the ground as she spun around and
knocked their legs out from beneath them.  The slayer
then staked one of the vamp and kicked the other in
the ribs as he tried to get back up.  A vamp grabbed
her from behind, only to have the slayer kick her leg
backwards and nail him in the groin.  She then kicked
the vamp that was once again trying to get back up in
the head knocking him back to the ground, before she
spun around and staked the moaning vamp behind here.
She then turned around and staked the vamp on the
ground before he could even try to get up again. The
remaining two vamps looked at her then charged.</p>

<p>Vlad told his children to go and make sure no one
could get in the area for a few more minutes then He
and Spike made there way through the smoldering
remains of the house.  They quickly  and headed down
the burnt out stairs that lead to the basement, an
evil grin filled Vlad’s face, his plan was coming
together and soon the witch would be his, and once he
had her the slayer would follow.  Vlad looked around
the basement scanning for were the three women might
have went.  He noticed the large metal door on one of
walls and walked over to it.  Gabbing the door by the
handle he ripped it from it’s hinges and walked into
the room.  Rage filled the master vampyre’s  face, as
he looked around the empty room.  There was no way
they could have escaped him yet they were not there.
He repeatedly rammed his fist into the brick wall
screaming out in pure hatred, how could they have
escaped him, there had been no way out for them.</p>

<p>Just as Buffy finished off the two vampires ten more
began to come down the road towards her, she now was
more angry at them than before these demon seed were
keeping her form Willow, but why.  She was ready to
attack them when two of them turned to dust as stakes
penetrated their hearts.  She quickly looked over her
shoulder to see Giles and  Kathryn behind her both
rapidly reloading crossbows.   </p>

<p>Anya stood in front of Giles house not wanting to
believe what she saw.  Nothing remained but bricks and
ashes, smoke from the burnt out house filled the air
around her, as Tears began to pore down her cheeks.
Anya began to weep, <How many of her friends had been
inside when this happened>, silently she sat there not
knowing what to do or were to go.</p>

<p>Xander lay in hospital bed tossing in a restless
sleep, as Spike sat in the chair next to his bed.  The
blonde vampire looked at him admiring his handy work.
“When this is over I am going to bring your girl here
and kill her before your eyes before I finish the job
I started.”  Spike then got up and walked out of the
room knowing that soon he would be able to do what he
had always wanted to do and finish of the slayers
friends, but for now the master needed them where they
were in order to keep the slayers mind preoccupied
with them and not The master.</p>

<p>Buffy and the others now stood next to Anya, all of
them in shock at the site of what once had been Giles
home.  Buffy dropped to her knees as tears freely
flowed, <What had they done with Willow></p>

<p>Vlad flung a table up against the wall smashing it
into little pieces as he screamed out Slavic
obscenities in an uncontrollable rage.  The witch had
been with in his grasp only vanish seemly into
nowhere,  how was that possible.  The more Vlad
thought about it the more enraged he became, he had
reached the point were he was beyond rage, lost to the
evil that poured through his dark heart.  Vlad walked
through the dust of the vampires that had allowed the
girl to escape towards Spike, “There are still a few
hours till sunrise, gather the rest of my children and
bring them to me.  I will find that witch even if I
have to tear this town apart,” snarled the master
vampyre.</p>

<p>“What of the one who escaped my Master, and the
slayers other friends,” Spike inquired, wondering if
the master still wanted the slayers friends help to
distract her.</p>

<p>“They are insignificant to me, I no longer wish for
them to be my prisoners, if you see any of them do to
them what you did to the boy, but save their deaths
for after the slayer is turned.  It will be easier if
she is thinking about  them laid up helpless in a
hospital.  Now get me my children, I want that witch”
Screamed the Vlad, his voice laced with the venom of
pure hatred, as he smashed his fist through the
concrete wall..</p>

<p>Then sun came up as it always does but the fact that
daylight had come to Sunnydale was lost on the slayer.
It did not matter that Wesley's party had been
completely wiped out and Tristin, who had been trying
to help them, now lay in a bed in the same trauma
center that Xander was in.  Nor did it matter that
Megan and Cordelia were missing and Giles house lay in
ruins.  She no longer even cared about Vlad Tepes
Dracul roaming the night, the only thing that Buffy
could focus on was her Willow.  The night had taken
the love of her life from her and she could feel her
heart falling apart,  sitting in the living room of
her mothers house, lost in despair, she once again
began to weep.</p>

<p>“Giles, can I talk to you,” Asked Joyce Summers.</p>

<p>“Sure,” Replied the watcher as he followed Buffy’s mom
into the kitchen leaving Buffy, Anya, and Kathryn
alone in the living room.</p>

<p>Joyce looked at the watcher then spoke, “I’m worried
about her Giles.  I have never seen her like this
before.  What can we do to find out what happened to
Willow and help Buffy“</p>

<p>Sadness filled the watchers face, “I don‘t know, I
just don‘t know,” He replied.  He wished he did but he
found himself lost and alone without any answers ,
they had barely survived the night, and now their
numbers were significantly reduced and Vlad Tepes was
on a rampage. &lt;what was to become of them&gt;</p>

<p>Sixty five vampires were gathered in the mansion, they
were the last of their kind that were in Sunnydale.
Vlad looked around the room at his remaining children,
so many of them had been sacrificed to get the witch
only to have her elude him, but once the sun fell once
again the world would feel his wrath and he would get
the witch into his grasp, there was no way he was
going to allow for that redheaded girl to get the best
of him.  Vlad walked over to Angel and removed the
sword from the traitor and broke it in half accrosed
his knee, he then proceeded to pummel maliciously on
his prisoner. </p>

<p>Joyce and Giles walked back into the living room and
Joyce went over and sat down next to Buffy putting her
hand on her daughters shoulder she Spoke, “We’ll find
Willow”</p>

<p>Giles motioned to Anya and Kathryn to join him in the
Kitchen as the Slayer began to speak.  Tears flowed
down her cheeks and her words came in between sob's of
sorrow, “And what if we don’t or if we’re to late”</p>

<p>“Don’t even think like that, somehow we will get to
her in time”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand, I have seen it.  I have seen
what he is capable of doing,” Buffy winced as she
finished speaking, visions of the horrors that Vlad
Tepes might take on her beloved filled her mind.  &lt;My
God, what has happened to us&gt;</p>

<p>Giles looked at the two girls that sat accrosed the
table from him, “Anya I hate to make you rehash what
you went through but I need to know what you saw and
heard while you were Vlad Tepes prisoner”</p>

<p>Anya sat there for a moment, she felt a cold chill
slowly work its way up her spine as she began to
recall her ordeal, “It was awful.  Both night and day
I could hear Angel screaming from the hell they were
putting him through.  I was so terrified that I was
going to be next but they never did anything to me,
they just kept me locked in a cage”</p>

<p>Anya began to quiver as she recalled what Angel had
looked like before she had made her escape, “Giles He
is a mess, the things that have been done to him are
unspeakable.”</p>

<p>Giles and Kathryn both sat there in horror after
having heard Anya’s tale.  The images of what was
happening to Angel struck terror in there hearts as
they realized what it was that Vlad Tepes truly was.
That however was not what had frightened Giles the
most, when Anya had mentioned that she overheard Spike
and Vlad plotting to turn the slayer Giles felt his
heart skip a beat, the master vampyre wished to turn
the slayer so he could overrun the world.  For weeks
they had tried to determine what his plans were and
now that they knew he wished they didn‘t.</p>

<p>Angels face was swollen, his entire body was covered
with bruises from Vlad’s beating.  He was so weak from
the endless torture that he could no longer speak, all
he could do is whimper and howl out in pain each time
Vlad would strike him. &lt;Please God let me die&gt;</p>

<p>The five of them sat in the living room as different
members of the group tried to unsuccessfully reassure
Buffy that they would save Willow.  Giles was lost to
his thoughts , He knew now that Vlad was hiding out at
the mansion, but he also knew that the place was
constantly crawling with vampires, if they were to
successfully  get in there they would have to come up
with something really good.   He was just about to
start brainstorming with the group when Cordelia and
Megan walked through the front door and into the
living room.  Before anyone could respond to their
entrance Buffy jumped up from her chair and rushed
over to the two women, “Where's Willow”</p>

<p>Cordelia looked right at Buffy, “We don’t know”</p>

<p>“What do you mean you don’t know you were with her
weren’t you”</p>

<p>“Yes, but..”</p>

<p>“But nothing where is Willow,” shouted Buffy</p>

<p>Giles got up and walked over to the slayer, putting
his hand on her shoulder he spoke in a reassuring
voice, “Buffy calm down and let them speak, it is not
going to get us any closer to finding Willow with you
shouting at Cordelia and Megan”</p>

<p>Giles then led Buffy back to the table and Cordelia
and Megan followed him.  After everybody had set down
Giles looked towards were Megan was sitting,  “What
happened”</p>

<p>“I’m not really sure, we had to flee to the basement
after Vlad Tepes had them set fire to your house
because he had placed vampires at all off the exits.
When we got down there we ran into your storage room.
As soon  as we got in there Willow started chanting to
the Goddess and next thing I know were not in the
basement any more”</p>

<p>“Where were you,” Inquired Giles his voice filled with
curiosity.</p>

<p> “That’s just it, neither of us knows where it was we
were taken.  I remember being surrounded by light and
hearing the laughter of children and several people
talking at the same time,  I couldn’t make out what
they were saying or see anyone but Willow and
Cordelia.  Then the next thing I know the two of us
are standing outside this house and a voice told me
that the slayer was here and we should go inside.”</p>

<p>Cordelia then got up and walked over behind Buffy’s
chair, she placed her hand on the Slayers shoulder,
“I’m not sure where it was we were taken, but it was
comforting being there, I felt peace like I have never
felt before, I am sure that Willow is safe.”</p>

<p>Buffy turned her head around and looked up at
Cordelia, “But I need her, why didn’t whoever saved
you send Willow back to me.”  A fresh set of tears
rolled down Buffy’s cheeks as she stared at Cordelia
looking for an answer to her question, but the other
girl had none.</p>

<p>Vlad stared at the covered window that blocked the
sunlight from them, he clenched his fist tightly as he
looked at Spike, “Soon William I will make them pay
and I will have the Witch”</p>

<p>“Yes Master, but you should relax some, we can't do
anything until the sun goes down,” Replied the blond
vamp.</p>

<p>“You're quite right,”  replied the Master Vampyre as
he began to walk over towards Angel.  Once he got
their he picked one of the ice picks up off of the
table were one of his children had left them for him.
Gazing into the broken eyes of the traitor he spoke,
“If you think that it is impossible to make you suffer
more than I have already done, then you are gravely
mistaken”</p>

<p>Vlad Then pushed the ice pick through one of the cuts
in Angels arm and guided it out another, sinisterly
laughing as the traitor whimpered in pain.  He then
picked up another ice pick and turned towards Spike,
“Wouldn’t you know it, I have over forty of theses
marvelous toys”</p>

<p>Joyce had taken Anya to the hospital to see Xander
promising that they would be sure to make it back well
before night fell and Megan had tagged along so she
could check up on Tristin and report back to Giles on
the slayer in training’s condition.  Cordelia had
stayed behind to hold down the fort and Giles was on
the phone with England informing them of what had
happened while Buffy and Kathryn tried to get some
sleep before having to go out on patrol.</p>

<p>Buffy fell into a restless sleep, all her thoughts
were on Willow and she yearned to have her love by her
side.  As she slept a vision came to her.  She stood
amongst a beautiful garden with Willow,  The redhead
reached out and took her hand and then softly kissed
her.  Buffy looked at her love with tear stained eyes,
“I miss you, please come back to me”</p>

<p>Willow closed the gap between them and took Buffy in
her arms, “Don’t worry my love, I soon shall return”
Willow kissed the slayer once again, and then Buffy
awoke.  She sat there in her bed and touched her lips
were Willow had kissed her in her dream state,  She
knew now that her love was safe but that did not ease
the pain she felt from being separated from Willow.
As she got up to head downstairs a new set of tears
began to flow.</p>

<p>Cordelia had drifted off to sleep, as soon as she
entered REM sleep she found herself standing before
the Oracles.  “We have come to you with a warning,”
spoke the female.</p>

<p>“What is it,” asked Cordelia pretty sure she wasn’t
going to like the answer.</p>

<p>The male spoke, “The slayer must not go out on patrol”</p>

<p>“The other warrior is not yet in place, she can not
win the battle alone,” added the female</p>

<p>“The other must be returned before the Master Vampyre
can be faced”</p>

<p>“If she and the others go into the darkness without
the other there can only be one result”</p>

<p>“Behold what will become if the journey we warned you
against is made” said the male as the room around
Cordelia faded away.</p>

<p>Cordelia found herself standing in a pallor,  before
her stood  two caskets.  She walked up to them to find
that they held Giles and Kathryn.  Then that image
began to fade and and gave way to another.  She found
herself in the cemetery.  Vlad and Spike stood before
Buffy and Willows graves, suddenly the ground that
surrounded the tombstones began to move and two
freshly risen Vampires arose.  “Welcome to the new
order my children,” said the  Master Vampyre as that
imaged faded from Cordelia's mind.  She awoke rapidly,
a cold sweat poured down her body, and she screamed in
terror at what she had saw, “Giles!”</p>

<p>Joyce walked into the house with Anya and Megan to
find the others franticly packing every weapon they
could get their hands on.  Giles looked at them, “Grab
whatever you need for a few nights and grab it
quickly, it’s going to be dark soon”</p>

<p>“What's going on here,” asked a very concerned Joyce
Summers</p>

<p>“Mom, Spike knows about this house and that means were
not safe here, the rest of it  Giles can explain on
the way to the hotel.”</p>

<p>Joyce saw the look of total panic in her daughters
eyes and knew that something major was about to
happen.  She went to the closet and grabbed a suitcase
and headed up stairs to pack it as fast as she could.
A few minuets later the group was piling into two cars
and heading towards a hotel on the outskirts of town
were they hoped that Vlad would not be able to find
them.</p>

<p>The soft white light that surrounded Willow began to
take form and suddenly she found herself standing
under a tree by a babbling brook.  The tree was filled
with song birds who produced the sweetest melody she
had  ever heard.  Everything about this place seemed
surreal.  “Where am I,”  She thought out loud.</p>

<p>“This is the Forever,” said a beautiful female voice
that was even sweeter than the melody of the song
birds.</p>

<p>Willow turned to see who had spoken to her.  The woman
who stood before her was radiant.  She had long
flowing blonde hair that looked as if it was made of
silk, her eyes were crystal blue and instantly put
Willow at ease when she gazed in them.  The woman wore
a elegant white robe that gently fluttered with the
cool breeze that filled the air.</p>

<p>“We have much tot talk about child,” said the woman.</p>

<p>“Who are you”</p>

<p>“I am of the of the silver moon, I am the sister of
the hidden wood, I am the enchantress-Star of the
night, I am Mother of the ageless womb, the spinner of
fates, and the Weaver of dream webs, I am Brigid”</p>

<p>Vlad marched down the street into the heart of
Sunnydale followed By Spike and the rest of his
children, His vengeful eyes were focused on the task
before him, there would be no denying his wrath.  The
moment of reckoning had come, the night now belonged
to him, and any who would stand in his way would
perish before him.  He smiled his hateful smile as
they reached downtown, soon the witch would be his. </p>

<p>Vlad stood there in front of the remnants of the burnt
out magic shop, as he watched the red and blue
flashing lights from a police cruiser rapidly
approach.  The car came to a halting stop in front of
the store and two officers jumped out with their guns
pointed at Vlad and his children, “Don’t move, stay
right where you are,” shouted one of the men.  Vlad
stared at them and rapidly walking towards them.  The
officers opened fire on the master vampyre, but their
bullets didn’t even slow Vlad down and before they
knew it he was upon them.  Vlad grabbed one of the men
by the back of the neck and flung him hard up against
the brick storefront.  He then grabbed the other man
and sunk his teeth into the officers throat, as he
drank his mind swam in a sea of arrogance, the night
belonged to him and there was no one who could stop
him.  He dropped the lifeless shell of the officer to
the ground and walked over to the other man who was
moaning in pain on the ground, picking up the gun that
lay next to the officer he rubbed his hand over one of
the wounds the bullets had caused.  Then Vlad fired
four shots into his victim, putting a bullet in both
each knee and elbow.  Vlad then tossed the gun to the
ground and turned to his children, “Go unto the night,
find me the witch, and destroy all who would stand in
our way, but save the slayer for me.”  After he had
finished speaking he kicked the helpless man in the
head before slowly walking into the night.</p>

<p>They sat in silence in the hotel room on the outskirts
of town, fearing what the night might bring and
wondering if they would see the sunrise.  Giles and
Megan both armed with crossbows kept watch over the
locked door as Kathryn guarded the window.  Joyce and
Cordelia sat in front of the police scanner Giles had
brought with them, listening as reports of roving
gangs terrorizing Sunnydale began to pour in.  Off in
a corner Buffy sat by herself, gazing off into space,
she had become lost within her own sorrow and there
was nothing anyone in the group could do to rescue her
as she slowly drowned in the misery of being separated
from her one true love. &lt;Willow please come back to
me&gt;</p>

<p>Ten vampires led by Spike stormed into a down town bar
and started ripping the place apart.  Four rather
drunk bikers stumbled to their feet and attempted to
start a fight with the vampires as several of the
other patrons ran for the door. One of the bikers took
a swing at Spike, but the blonde vamp caught his fist
in mid swing and crushed the bikers hand dropping the
man to his knees.  Spike then put both his hands on
the bikers head and snapped his neck.  Two of the
other bikers were jumped on by vampires before they
could even get a swing in, the last thing they would
ever recall before waking up in the forever was the
coldness of death as fangs sunk into their necks.  The
remaining biker managed to knock a vampire down only
to be picked up and thrown up against the wall by
another.  Before he could get back up two of the vamps
jumped him and began feeding as the bartender was
desperately trying to dial 911. </p>

<p>Vlad paced back and forth in front of the Joyce
Summers house, clenching his fist &lt;they hide, but no
one can elude me forever.&gt;  He was getting ready to
storm off when a car honked behind him. Vlad turned
around and a young man put his head out the window, “I
think they went somewhere, I saw them leaving earlier
this afternoon.  Could I help you.”</p>

<p>Vlad couldn’t believe his luck, these humans were so
stupid.  “I am looking for the redheaded girl called
Willow and was told she might be here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean the Rosenberg girl.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Vlad said with a sinister smile &lt;Rosenberg&gt;, Do
you know where I might find her”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I can’t help with that”</p>

<p>Vlad walked oup to the car and grabbed the man by the
shoulders and yanked him out through the window as the
women in the passenger seat began screaming, “Then you
can help me with this, I need substance,”  Vlad
grinned at the man showing his fangs then sunk them
into his victims neck.  After he had finished, Vlad
grabbed the bottom of the car with the women still in
it and flipped it over.  He pulled out a book of
matches and lit them.  As the woman begged for her
life Vlad tossed the burning matches on the car and
walked away.   Half way down the block from Joyce’s
home the master vampyre laughed out loud as he heard
the explosion, the night was truly his and these
pitiful creatures were only just beginning to feel his
wrath.</p>

<p>Cordelia had turned on the television in order to try
and find out more of what was going on.  Reports of,
emergency response teams rushing from one location to
another throughout Sunnydale along with the massive
influx of 911 calls had made the scanner almost
useless, Sunnydale seemed to be in total chaos and the
group wondered if anyone besides Vlad Tepes had even
an idea of what was happening.  The reporter on the
screen was announcing that the Sunnydale police chief
had enacted an immediate curfew and that all citizens
were to get off the street immediately and stay in
their homes until the roving gangs that were wrecking
havoc on the town were brought under control.  They
were also estimating that there were at least
twenty-two dead and several others injured.</p>

<p>Vlad stood next to the overturned telephone booth
holding the white and yellow book that read, Sunnydale
and vicinity.  He began flipping through the telephone
book, it didn’t take him long to find what he was
looking for, the name practically leaped out at him
when he saw it, and to top it off there was only one
entry.  Vlad tossed the book to the ground and began
to walk away, he had to go and pay Ira and Sheila
Rosenberg a visit.</p>

<p>Ira Rosenberg sat alone in the empty house getting
drunk like he had been doing for the last two nights
since his wife had stormed out screaming that he no
longer was the man she had fell in love with, how
could he say that to his own daughter, and that she
never wanted to see him again.  He missed Shelia but
he was right and wasn’t about to apologies. What their
daughter had become was wrong, first the witchcraft
and now she was dating that blonde girl, the one who
always seemed to be in some sort of trouble.  He
blamed the blonde for his problems but just didn’t
know what to do about it.  How could Sheila accept
Willows decision, what was his wife thinking when she
said that maybe Buffy was good for Willow.  No way
that blonde girl is good for my Willow thought Ira as
he took another drink of his beer.  Ira thought no he
knew that he had done the right thing when he had told
Willow that as long as she was with Buffy that she was
no longer his daughter, he had just not planned on his
wife leaving him over it.  Ira finished off his beer
and tossed it into the growing pile of empty bottles
next to the couch.  He then grabbed another one from
the cooler that sat on the couch next to him and
opened it and began to drink, &lt;Damn you Buffy
Summers&gt;. </p>

<p>Spike and the other vampires had totally devastated
downtown Sunnydale but had been unable to find Willow,
so the blonde vampire decided that it was time to pay
the campus a visit.  As they were making their way out
of the down town area they came upon a roadblock.
Several of Sunnydale’s finest were lined behind their
cruisers with their weapons pointing at the group of
vampires.  Spike looked at his brethren, “Bloody hell,
I haven't had this much fun in decades.” </p>

<p>The group of vampires then proceeded to charge the
blockade, as the police opened fire.  Vampires were
getting hit left and right as they rushed the
officers.  They would fall to the ground only to get
back up again screaming obscenities at a very confused
and frightened police line.  Spike was the first one
to break into the ranks of the blockade, he quickly
grabbed one of the cops and flung her into the
oncoming vampires.  A second officer produced a
nightstick, which Spike ripped from his hands and
proceeded to thrash the man with it as the rest of the
vampires rushed into the blockade.</p>

<p>Ira Rosenberg stumbled up from the couch and staggered
towards the door, who could possibly be out at this
time of night.  He opened the door to see a young man
dressed in black and wearing a red cape at the door,
“I suppose you're one of Willows little witch
friends,” he said sarcastically as he noticed the mans
unusual attire.</p>

<p>“Not exactly, but I do seek her, may I come in,”
Replied Vlad.</p>

<p>A hammered Ira Rosenberg looked at the young man for a
second, “Why the hell not, I could use the company.
Come on in and pull up a seat,” Slurred Ira</p>

<p>Vlad stepped into the Rosenberg house and followed Ira
as he staggered back towards the couch, The Master
vampyre silently wondered if he would become
elaborated after he fed off of the witch’s father.
Vlad looked at this pitiful creature before him and
spoke, “Do you know where your daughter is”</p>

<p>“No and I don’t care.  As far as I am concerned she is
not my daughter as long as she continues to be with
that other girl,” shouted Ira.</p>

<p>“Perhaps your wife might have some idea, is she
around” inquired Vlad.</p>

<p>The master vampyre watched as Ira lowered his head,
and realized that this man didn’t even know where his
wife was, he would be of no use.  Vlad got up from the
chair he was sitting in and walked over to Ira.  He
grabbed Ira by the shoulders and lifted the man up off
of the couch with one hand, maybe he could find
something useful in the house once he had fed.</p>

<p>Joyce was on the phone talking with Shelia, Willows
mom had called from the bread and breakfast she had
been staying at every since she had left her husband.
Shelia asked if any one had heard from Willow and
when she was told that they didn’t she asked how Buffy
was holding up.  The older Rosenberg woman had seen
that which her idiot husband had been unable to, Buffy
and Willow were simply met to be together and loved
each other like no one else ever could.  She knew that
it would take awhile to adjust to her daughter’s
lifestyle but she was determined to support the two
young women in every way she could, but she needed to
find Willow first.</p>

<p>As the two women talked on the phone Giles was glued
to the television as the reports as they came in.  The
downtown area had been practically obliterated and a
police line meant to contain the supposed roving gangs
had been broken.  The watcher looked at the rest of
the group then back to the television, he felt so
helpless.  He wasn’t supposed to be hiding like a
frightened child, he should be out there trying to
stop the vampires. Giles let out a sigh, they had
faced the master, the Mayor, and countless other
demons and vampires, but now Vlad Tepes had forced
them to go into hiding, what had become of them.   </p>

<p>Vlad marched through Buffy and Willows dorm wielding
the broad sword that he had picked up from the mansion
before heading to the campus.  He  kicked in the doors
to every room in the dorm, anyone who was foolish
enough to come out into the hall was immediately
decapitated by the master vampyre, the time had come
to stop looking for the witch and force her and the
slayer to come to him.  He was more enraged than when
the night had begun, the darkness that consumed him no
longer could be contained. When the master vampire
reached the end of the hallway he turned around and
looked at the bodies that littered it, turning away
from them he proceeded up the stairs to the next
floor, he would get their attention, he would force
them to show themselves, and anyone who stood in his
way would pay the price.</p>

<p>Spike and the others had arrived at the dorm just as
the master vampyre walked out the main door
brandishing a bloody sword.  Vlad looked at Spike,
“William, my patience is gone, it is time to leave a
message for the slayer and her little witch”</p>

<p>“Yes master”</p>

<p>Vlad then turned away from his children, looking at
the night sky he screamed out in frustration, how
could this mortal girl elude him so.  He looked to the
sky and saw that the darkness was beginning to fade,
He had won the night, but the witch once again had
escaped him.  He turned to Spike, then spoke.  His
words were filled with bitterness and he felt as if he
was going to choke on each one of them, “Day is almost
here, we must hurry”</p>

<p>The dawn brought no joy to Sunnydale, it only revealed
the atrocities that Vlad Tepes and his children had
brought upon the town.  Buffy had fell into a restless
sleep as the rest of the group sat in silence as
images of downtown Sunnydale filled the screen.  Half
the stores were burnt out, cars were overturned, and
the side walk was littered with the carnage the
vampiric army had left in it’s path, they gasp in
terror when the images of the college campus came on
the screen.  A reporter stood in front of a police
line saying that an unidentified man carrying a sword
had decapitated at least thirty students inside.
Giles felt his heart stop for a second as the camera
zoomed in on the front of the dorm.  On each side of
the entrance was a decapitated body impaled on large
metal spear, and written in blood above the entrance
was ‘Wicca yea can not escape My fury, I come.  Vlad.’</p>

<p>Giles got up and turned the television off, he looked
at the others and over to Buffy as she tossed back and
forth in the chair in which she slept.  He then went
over to the phone and dialed England to try and get a
status on when additional help would be arriving.  As
Giles was talking on the phone there was a knock at
the door and Kathryn went over and opened the door.
Shelia Rosenberg looked at the young girl, “May I come
in”</p>

<p>Before Kathryn could answer Joyce answered, “Sure,
come in Shelia”</p>

<p>“Any word since I last talked to you,” asked Shelia
her voice filled with fear over what had might have
happened to her daughter.</p>

<p>“No, we haven’t heard anything but I am sure that she
is fine”</p>

<p> Shelia looked at the other mother saw the sincerity
that she spoke with and somehow knew that Joyce was
right.  She then looked over at Buffy, “How is she
holding up?”</p>

<p>“Not good, She hasn’t eaten anything since Willow
vanished, all she does is sit off by herself and cry,
We can’t even get her to talk to us anymore.  I don’t
know what is going to happen to her or the world if we
don’t find Willow soon.”</p>

<p>“The world, Joyce what are you talking about?”</p>

<p>Joyce looked at Shelia,  “You had better brace
yourself, if Willow and Buffy are going to be a couple
you deserve to know the truth.”</p>

<p>Vlad stood in the center of the room staring at Angel,
“I know you can hear me, so listen.  Soon I will have
the witch and when I do the slayer will follow.  I
have decided that I will allow you to die, but not
until I turn the slayer, I want you to see it, to
witness your final failure before I send you to hell.”
Vlad walked over to Angel and grabbed his left index
finger, “In the meantime you still belong to me, and I
wish to send a present to the Slayer,” Vlad pulled out
a dagger from underneath his cape and tightened his
grip on Angel’s finger, “This will do nicely.”</p>

<p>All of the sudden Buffy shot up from the chair she was
in, she rushed to the door and flung it open with so
much force it almost came off of it’s hinges.
Standing in the hallway, preparing to knock was
Willow.  Buffy dropped to her knees as tears of joy
flowed down her cheeks and wrapped her arms around
Willows waste as she placed her head up against her
love.  Willow knelt down and helped Buffy to her feet
then embraced the girl.  </p>

<p>As Willow and Buffy stood there in the hallway holding
on to one another Brigid looked down from the forever
at the two young women, the awakening had begun. </p>

</table>

<p>As soon as Buffy and Willow had finished their embrace
the slayer had demanded that Giles go get another room
for her and Willow and he reluctantly had complied.
There were so many questions the watcher wanted to ask
Willow about the forever and what had happened there
and he was fairly certain that the rest of the group
wanted to talk with her, especially the girls mom.
However when he had went to voice his opinion the look
on Buffy’s face as she held onto Willow told him
everything he needed to know, so he remained silent,
their questions could wait for later.</p>

<p>Shelia Rosenberg sat there in near shock, she didn’t
know what to say, or even to think anymore.  The world
as she knew it had changed as Joyce talked with her,
she now knew of another world that existed in the
night, one where vampires and demons prowled the
streets.  She had always suspected that something was
wrong with Sunnydale but she had never imagined the
Hellsmouth, just the thought of such a thing sent a
cold shiver up her spine.   Only two things put her at
ease over this recently discovered knowledge.  First
Willow had returned safely and second that her
daughter’s girlfriend was the slayer, &lt;if you were
going to live in the hellsmouth the best person to
know was defiantly Buffy Summers. &gt;</p>

<p>Willow was setting up in the bed, her back leaning up
against the headboard, as Buffy snuggled up next to
her.  Buffy placed her head on Willows shoulder and
the redhead began softly running her hand through the
slayers silky blond hair, she leaned over and gently
kissed Buffy on the forehead.  </p>

<p>Buffy let out a soft sigh, “Willow promise me one
thing”</p>

<p>“I’ll promise you anything”</p>

<p>“Promise to never leave me.  While you were gone I
could barely function.  You’re my entire world,
without you I am nothing”</p>

<p>“I will never leave you, I wanted to come back to you
as soon as I arrived in the forever but it was vital
that I remained there for a short time.  My time there
with the Goddess was necessary if I am to help you
fight Vlad and whatever else the darkness brings”</p>

<p>“Willow”

“Yes Buffy”</p>

<p>“I do want to know what happened there but can we talk
about it later”</p>

<p>“Sure” replied Willow before she gently kissed Buffy’s
lips, “I love you so much I can’t even find the words
to express how I feel”</p>

<p>Buffy lifted her head off of Willows shoulders, “Well
you know what they say, actions speak louder than
words,” replied a smiling slayer as she leaned in for
another kiss.</p>

<p>Giles sat at the table contemplating what he had just
learned.  Help was on the way, but not anywhere close
to the scale he had been hoping for.  The council had
decided that instead of sending more slayers in
training they would instead mass them together in
England and begin rigorous training so that they could
hit the Master vampyre with their own army if Buffy
was unable to stop him.  So instead of warriors he was
getting two watchers and a council member.  Giles
slammed his fist down on the table, &lt;Damn them, don’t
they release that if Vlad succeeds that they won’t
just face him but would also be up against a vampiric
version of Buffy. &gt;  Giles shuddered at the last
thought that went through his mind, he still wasn’t
sure how to win but he had to stop that from happening
no matter what the cost.</p>

<p>Shelia and Joyce stood in the doorway to the home in
which the Rosenbergs had raised Willow.  The place was
a wreck, most of the furniture had been smashed and
there was broken glass everywhere. The two women
walked cautiously into the living room, and could not
believe what they saw.  Joyce barley caught Shelia as
she dropped to her knees screaming.  Tears rolled down
her face, “Why, God why?”</p>

<p>The couch had been ripped in half and in-between the
two pieces lay the late Ira Rosenberg.  On side of the
couch had the word ‘Wicca’ written on it and the other
side ‘Slayer’ written on it.  Then written at Ira’s
feet was the phrase, ‘Come to me.’   Joyce did the
only thing she could think of, she helped Shelia up
and guided her out the house.  Once outside she
grabbed the cell phone from her purse and made two
calls, one 911 call and another letting Giles know
what they had just found.</p>

<p>Eamonn sat in the in the first class cabin as the
airliner made it’s crossed the Atlantic, he observed
the council member and the two watchers as they talked
amongst themselves.  They were totally unaware that he
was even on the plane, but that was to be expected,
after all he had been watching the council every since
the Slayer and the Wicca had first met years ago and
they still knew nothing of him.  He leaned back into
the seat and closed his eyes, &lt;soon he would reveal
himself to those who had been called. &gt;</p>

<p>Buffy held Willow in her lap as she shed tears of
sorrow over the loss of her Dad.  The slayer gently
rocked her beloved in her arms softly whispering
comforting words to the redhead and promising to
avenge her father’s death.</p>

<p>She knew what her Dad had done to Willow, how just a
few days ago he had kicked the most wonderful girl in
the world out of his life because he was to narrow
minded to see past his own prejudices.  She also knew
that Willow despite all he had done still cared for
her dad and it that it tore her up inside knowing not
only that he died but that he died at the hands of the
master vampyre.  &lt;Vlad Tepes Dracul I will find a way
to send you to hell, no one hurts my Willow like this.
&gt;</p>

<p>Giles had just finished introducing Collin, Quentin’s
replacement on the council, and the two watchers,
Archer and Hughes, and now it was time to get ready
for the night.  Collin was going to stay at the hotel
with the Hughes and the others as Buffy, Kathryn,
Giles and Archer went on patrol.   Buffy looked over
at Willow, “You ready.”</p>

<p>Willow got up and walked over to Buffy and grabbed her
hand, “I’m ready”</p>

<p>“Willow, exactly what are you ready for: inquired
Giles fearing he already knew where this conversation
was headed.</p>

<p>Willow looked at Buffy and it was the slayer who
answered the question, “We talked it over with our
moms and she’s going on patrol with me tonight, now
lets get going”</p>

<p>“No she’s not,” shouted Giles, “Have the two of you
lost it, it’s to dangerous out there”</p>

<p>“And it’s nice and safe here, I think not.  Last time
I left her so I could go out on patrol I almost lost
her and there is no way that I am going to allow that
again.”</p>

<p>“But Buffy….”</p>

<p>Buffy rudely interrupted Giles by shouting over his
voice drowning the watcher out, “But nothing this
discussion is over.  If you don’t like it then you can
stay her and we will go on patrol by ourselves, but I
am not stepping a foot out that door without Willow by
my side were I know she is safe.”</p>

<p>Giles and the other watchers looked at the slayer, as
she stood there holding Willows hand and glaring them
down.  He looked Buffy square in the eyes and saw that
there was no way that him or anyone else was going to
win this argument, especially since Buffy had Joyce
and Shelia in her corner.</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow walked through the cemetery holding
hand with Giles and Archer close behind them, both men
armed with crossbows.  Kathryn walked on the other
side of Willow just as Buffy had told her to, just
incase there was a surprise attack from that
direction.  Suddenly Buffy stopped and motioned for
Willow to get behind her.  The redhead released the
slayer’s hand and stepped directly behind her very
protective lover.  Seven vamps came around the corner
to Buffy’s right.  Giles and Archer both let go with
shots from their crossbows and then there were five.
Buffy sprung into action as the two watchers reloaded
their weapons.  She caught on of the vamps with a side
kick to the jaw sending him backwards into a
tombstone.  She then caught another with a leg sweep
knocking him to his back.  One vamp tried to rush past
her when he saw Willow but she nailed him with a
clothesline to the throat sending him hard to the
ground.  She produced Mr. Pointy and staked the vamp
she got with the clothesline. And then rolled over and
staked the vamp she nailed with the leg sweep.  Two of
the vamps jumped her as one rushed past her only to
meet Kathryn, who connected with a kick to the chest,
followed by a series of quick jabs that knocked him
off balance.  She then sent him flying backwards with
a roundhouse.  By that time Buffy had finished off the
two vamps who had attacked her, she tossed a stake
through the air into the chest of the remaining
vampire as he picked himself off the ground.  The
stake stopped short of hitting his heart and the vamp
smiled with relief as he started to pull it out, but
before he could Buffy hit him with a flying kick that
drove it all the way home and reduced him to dust.</p>

<p>Collin and Hughes both armed with crossbows sat in
their chairs facing away from one another.  Collin was
carefully watching the door as Hughes kept vigil on
the window.  Anya and Cordelia sat listening to the
scanner hoping not to get a repeat of last night but
that was not to be the case.  A half-hour after the
sun went down calls started coming that the roving
gangs were back and had started attacking people who
were out and about on the UC Sunnydale campus.  Joyce
and Shelia both sat there both hoping and praying that
Buffy and Willow were safe.</p>

<p>They had finished their patrol of the cemetery and had
started walking the campus.  A several screams could
be heard from up ahead.  Quickly Buffy rushed to see
what was happening, with the other right behind her.
A group of fifteen vampires had three students
trapped up against the wall to one of the buildings.
“Can anybody play;” Buffy shouted at the vampires.</p>

<p>“The slayers decided to show herself, and had brought
her little witch friend with her,” said Wesley as he
stepped forward thinking how proud he was about to
make the master.</p>

<p>The vampires rushed the group as they took up their
fighting positions.  As they did Willow threw out her
hands and all fifteen vamps went flying backwards, as
if thrown by some unseen force.  Giles and Archer just
stood there stunned over what they had just witnessed.
Buffy and Kathryn however took full advantage over
what Willow had done, both of them produced stakes and
charged the vamps as they were getting back up to
their feet.  Buffy staked two of them as they got up
and Kathryn got a third.  A vampire attacked Kathryn
while ten of them surround Buffy, “Remember don’t kill
her” shouted Wesley as he stood back and watched.
Buffy was starting to wonder how she was going to
fight ten vamps at the same time, especially since it
looked like they were going to be coming from all
directions.  </p>

<p>The vampire had knocked Kathryn down and was preparing
to pounce on her when a stake from Giles crossbow
connected with him and ended his existence.  She then
got back up to her feet and turned to see that the
slayer was in serious trouble.</p>

<p>Willow couldn’t believe what was happening, the
vampires had surrounded Buffy and were about to attack
her.  The redheaded wicca concentrated on the vampires
that surrounded Buffy and with her right arm reached
out towards them screaming, “Stay away from her.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a circle of fire formed around Buffy, rapidly
the flames spread out and engulfed the vampires.  As
soon as the last of her attackers was destroyed the
flames vanished and Buffy found herself standing in
the middle of a circle, formed by the scorched earth,
unharmed.  She turned to Wesley who stood there trying
to figure out what had just happened.  The vampire was
so absorbed by what he had witnessed he didn’t even
notice as the slayer walked over to him and thrust a
stake into his heart.  </p>

<p>Buffy Walked over to Willow and gave her a big hug,
“Thanks, I think I owe you one now”</p>

<p>“You can pay me back later,” replied Willow grinning
from ear to ear.</p>

<p>Giles and the others stood there for a moment
contemplating what Willow had done, and dying to hear
the redheads explanation.  They then quickly regrouped
and as the five of them started walking away to finish
the patrol of the campus a young man wearing a black
business suite stepped out from the hedges. Eamonn
smiled to as he watched the group walk away,
&lt;everything was coming together rather nicely. &gt;</p>

<p>Vlad stood at the edge of the campus, “William, the
slayer and the witch are here tonight.  Find them and
bring me the witch”</p>

<p>Spike looked at the master vampyre, “Yes, Master.”  He
then left with a force of thirty-five vampires behind
him.</p>

<p>Vlad watched as his children departed, his plan had
worked better than he had anticipated.  Not only had
he forced the slayer out of hiding but she had even
brought the witch with her.  A sinister smile filled
his face, everything seemed to be coming together, and
soon they both would be his. </p>

<p>The door to the mansion opened and the two vampires
that had been left behind stood up and began walking
towards the man who had been foolish enough to stumble
into the masters lair.  The man waved his had through
the air and the two vamps approached him and they both
turned into.  He then walked over to where Angel hung
and moved his hand over the chains that held the
tortured vampire.  As he did the lock simply opened
and Angel fell into the man’s arms.  The man then
looked at Angel, “I am Eamonn.  Be not afraid, your
suffering has come to an end.”</p>

<p>They could see them up ahead in the clearing, there
were about ten vampires.  Buffy turned to Giles, “This
Doesn’t look to bad”</p>

<p>The group followed Buffy into the clearing, but when
they did fifteen more vamps emerged from the bushes to
the right and another ten from the tree line to the
left.  “Nice of you to join us,” said Spike as he
walked out from behind the ten vampires they had
originally seen, the group had walked into an ambush. </p>

<p>Giles and Archer both fired shots at the vampires
taking two of them out.  As the two watchers reloaded
Willow pointed at the tree line and it burst into
flames catching most of the vampires on that side in
its flames.  Buffy quickly positioned herself between
the vampires to their right as the watchers picked off
the remaining vampires to there left as they tried to
flee from the flames.</p>

<p>Buffy connected a right hook on a vamp only to have
two others grab her.  She broke there grip and leg
swept one followed by a left hook and a upper cut that
put the other vampire on the ground.  Three other
vampires rushed her as the ones she had knocked down
to the ground began to get back up.  Buffy staked one
of them as he approached and started fending of the
other two as a third one knocked her to the ground.
One of the vamps jumped on here but she managed to
roll away as he did so.  As she got back up a vampire
hit her on the back of the head sending the slayer
sprawling forward.  As soon as she hit the ground she
sprung back up and caught the vampire that had hit her
with a roundhouse sending him to the ground.  She then
leg swept another one and staked him on the way down.
A vampire ran at her put she dropped to the ground as
he went to tackle her and he flew overtop the blonde.</p>

<p>Kathryn had managed to stake one vampire only to come
face to face with Spike. The blonde vamp blocked every
one of her blows before connecting with a solid hit
that landed the girl flat on her back.  The blond vamp
then grabbed the slayer in training and threw her into
the side of a tree.</p>

<p>As the vampires ran past Spike towards the two
watchers and the witch, Willow waved her hand and
they burst into flames.  The vampires fell to the
ground and started violently thrashing about for the
few quick moments before they turned to dust. </p>

<p>Willow turned to the remaining vamps to see that there
were still six of them left. Buffy was giving it
everything she had just to block the punches and kicks
that were coming from every direction.  The vampires
had got her trapped in a circle and were attacking
with all there fury.   Giles and archer looked at
Willow who now was focusing on the vamps and for the
second time tonight a circle of flames surrounded
Buffy and engulfed her attackers.  </p>

<p>Buffy looked around her, all the vampires were gone
including spike.  She walked over to where Kathryn was
lying on the ground and knelt down next to the slayer
in training as the others came up behind her.  Buffy
turned to Willow, “she’s still alive, but not by much”</p>

<p>
Vlad ripped the empty chains from the wall and
violently threw them into the fireplace.  What had
happened, not only did he loss the majority of his
children and been unable to capture the witch but his
prisoner was now gone.  He looked at Spike who had
just finished telling him what had happened when they
tried faced the slayer in the witch, “The girl is
stronger than we thought.  I still will win this but
it is time for a change of plans.  First we must leave
this place because the slayer know knows where it is.
Second I will raise a new army, then we will attack
again.  However it is time things will be different.
It now appears that the witch is more of a threat than
the slayer.”</p>

<p>“So we use the slayer as bait for the witch, Master,”
asked the blonde vampire wondering if he had correctly
guessed the masters plan.</p>

<p>Vlad’s whole body shook in anger, and his words were
filled with pure hatred, “No we kill the slayer, and
when the witch is in mourning I will destroy her.  The
two of them have ruined my plans and they will die for
it.”</p>

<p>“And what of the next slayer”</p>

<p>“After facing the witch and this slayer whoever is
called will be easy to turn.” Replied Vlad as he began
to walk towards the door of the mansion. &lt;Soon he
would have his revenge and the two girls would be no
more. &gt;</p>

<p>Giles and Archer carried Kathryn into the room and
placed her on the bed. Willow helped Buffy over to one
of the chairs, the slayer was covered with cuts and
bruises from her last battle.  Then to everyone’s
amazement Willow lifted her hand up in front of Buffy,
as she did a strange golden glow seemed to emanate
from it.  She then slowly moved her hand back and
forth across Buffy’s body.  The slayer’s wounds seemed
to mysteriously vanish as Willow pasted her hand over
them.  After that she walked over to the bed and
placed her hand above Kathryn’s head and slowly moved
it above the girl’s body, healing her just as she did
Buffy.  When she was done the exhausted wicca went
over to the chair Buffy was in and sat in the slayers
lap.  Willow then looked at the others and saw the
expressions on their faces, the time had come to
explain what exactly had happened in the forever.</p>

<p>“I stood in in the presence of the Goddess,
Why have I been brought here I asked
The time has come for you to awaken my child
replied the Goddess
Awaken, I don’t understand I said
The chosen one is in need of a champion to protect
her and fight beside her said the goddess
But I am only one and my power is not that great I
said
I will give you three gifts to aid you said the
goddess</p>

<p>I give you the fires of love
With it you will destroy those who would harm your
beloved
With it you and the chosen one will protect all of my
children</p>

<p>I give you the power of the healing touch
So that you can ease the pain and suffering of not
only your beloved
but all who need it</p>

<p>I unlock your minds eyes
with it the magic that is within will grow beyond
your hopes and dreams</p>

<p>How do I use these gifts I asked
I will give you the knowledge for the first two said
the Goddess
And what of the third I said
A teacher will come replied the Goddess”</p>

<p>Giles and Collin along with the other two watchers and
Megan were astonished by what Willow had said. All of
their adult lives they had studied ancient prophecies
and lore, as they trained to guide the slayers in the
battle against the Hellsmouths, but as the redheaded
Wiccan spoke they saw all of that that changing. The
Goddess had altered everything they knew and
understood when she had taken Willow into the Forever,
they were now uncertain if they still had a role to
play in the struggle against the forces of the
Hellsmouths.</p>

<p>Angel awoke and found himself laying on a cot in what
appeared to be an abandoned warehouse, he slowly sat
up and looked around only to find that he was very
much alone in a very bizarre place. Candles were
burning all around the large empty room, there was
another cot off in the corner to his left with a small
wooden box next to it that was being used as a night
stand. In the middle of the room a circle was drawn
on the floor with symbols representing the elements of
magic drawn all around it. In the center of the
circle a lone white candle burnt. Each of the wall in
the rather large room had the same symbol drawn on
them, it was a triangle with a circle inside it, and
two vertical lines ran parallel through the center of
circle. He slowly got to feet and began to walk
around, suddenly the brooding vamp stopped in shock as
he realized that his body no longer hurt. Angel
looked down to see that not only were all his wounds
healed but everything was were it was suppose to be,
all the damage Vlad Tepes had done was somehow now
erased, some how the mysterious man who had rescued
him had also restored him. </p>

<p>Xander laid in his bed as the pain killers from the IV
flowed through his body, he heard the door open and
looked up to see Anya standing there smiling with
Buffy and Willow. His life long friend walked over to
his bed and placed her hand above his head.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry Xander, everything is going to be fine,”
said Willow as her hand began to emanate a golden glow
that seemed to spread out accrosed his body.

Vlad paced back in forth through the main area that
had once been the initiatives headquarters. Just a
few short days ago he had been at the top of the world
and could feel his plan coming into place, but that
witch and her slayer lover had ended all of it for
him. He howled out in rage at what the two girls had
done as he brought his powerful fist down on top of a
metal table breaking it half, “I will have my
revenge!” screamed the master vampyre.</p>

<p>The group walked out of the trauma center and headed
towards the two cars that were waiting for them, both
Tristin and Xander were amazed at what had just
happened. Both of them had been excepting a long
recovery from what the doctors were saying, but
somehow Willow had done in a matter of a half hour
what should have taken months, they both looked over
at the redhead in awe. Willow leaned up against Buffy
for support as the slayer helped her weaken lover to
Giles car. Xander wasn’t exactly sure what it was or
how willow had done it but he knew that whatever she
had used to heal him and the slayer in training had
weakened his friend.</p>

<p>Angel sat own his cot wondering what was going on, he
turned his head when the door to the room opened and
the young man who had rescued him walked in. This man
who called himself Eamonn was now dressed very
differently than he had been last night. Instead of
the black suite he had been wearing, the man now wore
only a simple brown robe as he walked over to Angel.</p>

<p>“Good, I see you are awake.” stated Eamonn.</p>

<p>Angel looked at this mysterious man, “I owe you a
great debt but who are you”</p>

<p>“As I told you last night, I am Eamonn.”</p>

<p>A bewildered look crept accrosed Angel’s face, He had
always thought the Powers that be were vague but this
guy seemed to be trying to out do them in that
department, “That's not what I ment”</p>

<p>“I know, but now is not the time. I have yet to
reveal myself to those who had been called.” replied
Eamonn as he handed Angel several packets of blood
that he had acquired from the local hospital, “Eat
now, then rest. Tonight you are to return to your
friends.”</p>

<p>After talking with Collin, Giles had went and rented
several other rooms so everybody could have there
privacy, with the understanding that once the sun went
down everyone not on patrol would have to go and stay
in the same room till sunrise. Buffy and Willow of
course had the room he had gotten them the night
before, but now each of the girls mothers had their
own room, Xander and Anya had their own room which
they had rushed to as soon as Giles handed Anya the
key, and everyone else also got a room of their own.
Fortunately with the events of the last few weeks the
hotel was fairly vacant and he had been able to get
all the rooms on the same floor. </p>

<p>Giles sat by himself wondering what was happening.
First Vlad Tepes had come and threw their lives into
so much turmoil, they could no longer even keep a
normal sleeping pattern, they would stay awake all
night and get a few ours of sleep in the morning and
early afternoon before getting up and preparing for
another night. And now the Goddess had taken matters
into her divine hand and his world once again had
changed, &lt;If this keeps up I don‘t know what I am
going to do, is it even possible for things change
anymore.&gt;</p>

<p>The group had armed up and was preparing to head out
on patrol when there was a knock at the door. Giles
and Collin pointed their crossbows at the door as the
slayer slowly opened it, everyone's jaws about hit the
ground as Buffy opened the door all the way, in the
hallway stood Angel.</p>

<p>“May I come in,” asked the brooding vamp</p>

<p>“Sure,” replied a very curious and confused Slayer.</p>

<p>Cordelia stood there for a moment as she looked at her
friend, all his wounds were gone and he looked exactly
like he had when they had first arrived in Sunnydale.
A tear rolled down her face as she ran over to the
brooding vamp and gave him a big hug. Giles watched
as Cordelia hugged Angel, he let out a sigh &lt;Here we
go again.&gt;</p>

<p>Angel after a few moments broke off the hug and looked
at the group, “we have to talk before anyone goes
out.”</p>

<p>“About what,” A reluctant Giles asked, knowing that
some how Angel was about to change everything even
more.

“Vlad Tepes for one. But more importantly a man
calling himself Eamonn.” </p>

<p>The police cruiser stopped short of hitting the figure
that was standing in the middle of the road, the two
officers carefully got out and began to approach the
young man. As they did they felt their minds begin to
fog, “Welcome to the new order of things,” Vlad said
as Spike grabbed one of the men from behind. The
other officer spun around to help his partner only to
have Vlad’s fangs sink quickly into his neck.</p>

<p>Angel had taken point on the patrol, he was followed
by Xander then Buffy and Willow. Giles was off to the
girls right and Archer was to their left, with Kathryn
and Tristin bring up the rear. Giles had to almost
laugh to himself at this formation they were walking
in. Buffy had formulated it in order to better
protect Willow during the patrol, but after last night
he was certain that of everyone out here Willow
probably needed the least protection. He had thought
about mentioning it to Buffy and suggesting that they
spread out a little more, but he didn’t. He had
learned anything since Willows return, it was when it
came to the redhead Buffy was extremely protective and
there wasn't anyone who could win an argument with the
slayer over Willows safety, including Willow.</p>

<p>Vlad and Spike walked down the darken streets towards
the local homeless shelter. The master vampyre had
decided that the best place to find recruits for his
army without alerting the witch and slayer to what he
was doing was to take those who would be least missed.
What better place was there in this town than the
shelter, everyone there had been forgotten by the
outside world, they had no friends or family that
would miss them, and the good people of Sunnydale in
an effort to ease their hearts had grouped them all
together out of site from the rest of the town, it was
practically a all you can eat buffet for his kind.</p>

<p>The group came up on a police cruiser stopped in the
middle of the road, but there were no cops to be
found. They knew that something was very wrong, first
after two hours of patrol not a single vampire could
be found and now this. The engine on the cruiser was
still running but it looked as if it had been
abandoned. Buffy turned to Giles, “What is gong on
here. For the last couple of nights it has been all
about death and destruction for Vlad, but now nothing
seems to be going on.”</p>

<p>Angel looked at the rest of them as Buffy’s words sunk
in, they could all see the look of dread the seemed to
take over his face. Buffy looked at the brooding
vamp, “You know something, what is it”</p>

<p>Angel took a second to pull it together then spoke, “I
learned a few things as Vlad Tepes tortured me and I
listened to him plot. He is not like most vampires,
not only is he extremely powerful he is also highly
intelligent. Even when he is in a total rage, he is
aware of what he is doing. If there is nothing going
on I believe it could mean only one of two things.
Either he is plotting something, or he wishes us not
to know what he is doing, so he is being careful
ensuring that he conceals it from us.”</p>

<p>Buffy then turned to Giles, “He‘s right, the last time
it was quite like this was right before he hit us and
burned your house down,” Buffy let go of Willows hand
and wrapped her arms tightly around her beloved
recalling how that attack almost had taken Willow away
from her. “I think it’s time we check out the
mansion”</p>

<p>“Buffy, I don’t know if that is the smartest thing to
do,” replied Giles.</p>

<p>Buffy looked at him as she held on to Willow, “It’s
either that or wait for him to figure out how to take
us all out, your call”</p>

<p>Giles pondered Buffy’s statement then spoke, “The
mansion it is.”</p>

<p>A large moving van, with its lifeless owner lying in
the back, sat in front of the homeless shelter. There
was no sign of life anywhere around the shelter. The
only ones that were moving had been dead for a long
time, and were quickly tossing their victims cold
bodies into the back of the truck. As they tossed the
last couple of bodies into the truck Vlad looked at
Spike then into the back of the van, &lt;When you awaken
my children a new order will begin.&gt;</p>

<p>The rest of the group nervously sat in the crowed
hotel room, listening to the nearly silent police
scanner. It appeared that the only thing going on was
that a couple of Sunnydales finest had disappeared but
besides that the night seemed to be quite. </p>

<p>Anya sat alone trying to figure out why Xander had
decide to go out on patrol. She had just gotten him
beck from the hospital and now he was out there once
again risking everything, but why. Xander had told
her that he owed it to them after all Willow had
healed him. She had begged her boyfriend to stay with
her, but had lost the argument, so now all she could
do was wait with the others and hope that he made it
back safely.</p>

<p>On the other side of the room Cordelia was lost in
similar thoughts about Angel. She had felt so alone
when he had vanished and she had been afraid of losing
her best friend. When she had learned of what he was
going through it had torn her apart, then earlier
tonight when he walked through that door she felt her
inner agony go away. She knew that they had become
close, and that she cared for him but now she found
herself questioning her feelings, trying to figure out
what was gong on inside her, &lt;Do I love Him.&gt;</p>

<p>The patrol stood in the empty mansion, there was no
sign of vampiric activity any were. Only the holes in
the wall and smashed up furniture gave a hint that
anyone had been there. All of the master vampyre’s
torturing devices were gone, only a series of smashed
up metal cages were left behind. Written in blood on
the wall where Angel had been held prisoner was the
words ‘You can not escape my wrath, you might have one
a battle but the war will be mine. Soon all shall
perish. Vlad.’ </p>

<p>As the group departed the mansion and headed back to
the hotel they were staying Eamonn walked out from the
bushes he had been watching them from and headed into
the mansion. He looked around and saw what Vlad had
written. He spoke out loud to himself, “What are you
up to?” Eamonn then turned from the wall and headed
for the door, he had so much to prepare, the time for
him to reveal himself was almost at hand.</p>

<p>Vlad looked out accrosed the room as he waited for his
new children to rise, “Soon William we will have our
revenge. Tomorrow I will send out some of my children
to keep the slayer and witch busy so that we can
finish my army in peace.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Master,” replied the blond vampire.</p>

<p>“Then I will deal with the slayer and witch, her
friends are now yours to do with as you see fit.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I won’t let disappoint you,” Replied Spike
as he began to wonder which one of them would go
first.</p>

<p>“I know William, I know,” replied Vlad as he walked
over to where he and Spike had laid out his newly
found children, &lt;The will not escape me this time&gt;</p>
