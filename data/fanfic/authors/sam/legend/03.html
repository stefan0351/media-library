<p>Buffy sat down in a empty chair as soon as she and the
others returned from their patrol. As soon as she was
seated Willow was in her lap, curling up against the
slayer and gently kissing her on the cheek before
resting her head on the Buffy’s shoulder. Xander went
and sat on the floor off to the side off the room next
to Anya who immediately snuggled up against him, glad
to see that he had returned unharmed. The rest of the
patrol went and took seat around the table in the
middle of the room to talk with Collin and Hughes
about tonight's events. As they did Buffy and Willow
both noticed that Cordelia got up from the chair she
was sitting in and went over taking a seat next to
Angel. Both the girls looked at her as she slid the
chair she had taken as close to the brooding vampires
seat as she could get, they then looked at one
another, their minds filled with curiosity over the
scene that was playing out before them. &lt;What‘s going
on with those two.&gt;</p>

<p>"Giles how did the patrol go," asked Collin.</p>

<p>"It was rather uneventful. We didn’t see a single
vampire, it would appear that for now Vlad Tepes has
become completely silent but unfortunately with the
likes of him silence can be deadly." Giles paused for
a second then continued, "There is one other thing."</p>

<p>"Go ahead."</p>

<p>"We went to the mansion to see if we could gain any
information only to find that it had been abandoned
and that a message had been left for us."</p>

<p>Buffy tightened her embrace around Willow as Giles
relayed the message that Vlad Tepes had left behind.
Everyone in the room just sat there for a few moments
after the watcher had spoken, there were no words for
what all of them were felling, for the first time
since his arrival the master vampyre was making his
intentions clear, Vlad Tepes wanted them all dead.</p>

<p>Eamonn sat in a plain brown robe in the middle of the
circle that he had drawn on the floor and began to
chant, </p>

<p align=center>"Earth beneath me, Sustainer of Life;<br>
Air around me, Inspiring all Life;<br>
Fire of Stars above me, Empowerment of Life;<br>
Water within me, Refreshing of Life."</p>

<p>After he had finished centering himself Eamonn slowly
arose and stepped out of the circle, he looked around
the warehouse that had been his home since he had
arrived at the Hellsmouth, then walked over to his
makeshift sleeping area and began to gather his
belongings, &lt;Tonight he would reveal myself to those
who have been called.&gt;</p>

<p>Collin looked directly at Angel, we have discovered
something about your friend Eamonn"</p>

<p>Angels eyes were filled with curiosity as he inquired
about the mysterious man who had saved him, "What did
you find?"</p>

<p>"First the name Eamonn comes from the Irish Gaelic, it
means Blessed Protector. Second the symbol that you
described to us," As Collin spoke he picked up the
open book that laid in front of him and place it
before Angel, "is that it."</p>

<p>Angel looked down at the book and saw the familiar
symbol that had been on all the walls of the abandoned
warehouse, "Yes, what is it?"</p>

<p>"It is called a Sigil, and it is believed to bring
powerful magic. Though no one knows for certain what
kind of magic. Every reference we found on it seems
to indicate that it might be used for protection and
or banishment."</p>

<p>Willow looked up at the men at the table and
interjected, "What a second, I’m a witch and know
something about magic, pentagrams are used in
protection spells."</p>

<p>Collin turned to Willow, "Nowadays for a Wiccan such
as yourself that is quite true, however the Sigil was
used in the ancient lands of the Celts by Druids. I‘m
not sure exactly what all of this means, it only seems
to make this Eamonn more of a mystery."</p>

<p>Buffy looked at Collin, "What because he is most
likely a Druid?"</p>

<p>Collin looked at the slayer but spoke to Willow,
"Should I tell her or do you wish to elaborate?"</p>

<p>Willow took her head up off of Buffy’s shoulder and
looked her love in the eyes, "There hasn’t been any
known Druids in a very long time."</p>

<p>"How long," asked Buffy not sure if she was gong to
like the answer or not.</p>

<p>"I’m not really sure," Replied Willow as she looked
over to the table for help.</p>

<p>Collin looked at the two girls, "The last records of
any one having contact with the Druids dates to right
around the turn of the first millennium, almost a
thousand years ago."</p>

<p>Vlad looked out across the main room of his new lair,
"Look at them William, my new children," He said as he
gazed at the fifty plus vampires that just one night
ago had been residents of the Sunnydale homeless
shelter.</p>

<p>"Yes master their number is impressive, but they are
newly reason the slayer and witch might be able to
finish them off quickly."</p>

<p>"I know, that is why I will send some of them out but
only enough to occupy the two girls as we continue to
build our numbers. Newly risen vampires are no match
for the two, so we must overwhelm them with a
numerically superior force. And When I have enough
children to do that I will strike and we will have our
vengeance as I stand over a dead slayer."</p>

<p>"And what of the Witch"</p>

<p>"With her love gone she will no longer care as I drain
her life force from her, then and only then will my
rage be satisfied."</p>

<p>Vlad then stepped forward towards his children with a
sinister grin crossed his face. The master vampyre’s
eyes filled with pure hatred for the witch and her
slayer as he spoke, "Soon My children the new order
will begin, nothing will stop me this time. They can
not win."</p>

<p>The mid afternoon sun brought sorrow as they headed
back towards their cars leaving the cemetery behind.
Buffy helped Willow back to her mom’s car as the
redhead silently wept. They were followed By Joyce
and Giles who were helping a sobbing Shelia Rosenberg
to the same care. Buffy looked at her lover as she
opened the door for the redhead, the next few days
were going to be hard for Willow, not only did she
have to mourn the passage of her dad but Vlad Tepes
was getting ready for something major. The slayer
shivered as she thought about what Giles had told her,
shortly before they were to leave for the funeral he
and Collin had learned that the entire populous of
the homeless shelter had mysteriously vanished in the
night, and in the Hellsmouth with Vlad Tepes running
around that could only mean one thing.</p>

<p>Eamonn walked out the doors of warehouse wearing the
same black suite he had worn when he rescued Angel, on
his back was the small pack that contained all his
worldly possessions. He watched as the sun slowly
made it’s decent into the western horizon, &lt;the light
was giving way to darkness and soon Vlad Tepes would
roam the Hellsmouth.&gt; He began to walk towards the
campus were he knew those who had been called would be
headed, &lt;It is time to be revealed.&gt;</p>

<p>No one really felt like going out on patrol especially
Willow and Buffy. It had been a long day, The slayer
had spent most of it comforting Willow and giving her
love a shoulder to cry on. She knew that Willow was
hurting, she could feel it deep inside her and see it
in her loves eyes. Seeing Willow hurting like this
tore her up inside, &lt;Master vampyre or not your going
to pay for this.&gt; She wrapped her arms around Willow
and kissed her on the forehead, "Are you sure you want
to go out tonight, maybe you should stay her with your
mom." Buffy said as she looked over in Shelia’s
direction. </p>

<p>Willow leaned into Buffy and rested her head on the
slayers shoulder, "No, you need me, and I need to be
there for you. Besides Mom has your Mom, Cordelia,
Anya, Megan, and the others to be there for her why
we're out."</p>

<p>"Your sure?" Asked Buffy </p>

<p>Willow stepped back from Buffy and took the blonde by
the hand , "I’m sure"</p>

<p>Buffy then turned to the rest of the group, "You
guys ready to roll."</p>

<p>Xander gave Anya a hug before heading towards the door
and Cordelia walked up to Angel and gave him a hug,
which the not so brooding vampire returned followed by
a very quick and light kiss on the cheek. Angel then
turned to a Buffy noticing the look of curiosity on
her face as she absorbed what had just happened, "I’m
ready," he replied, hoping Buffy didn’t ask him what
was going on because he wasn’t sure himself, all he
really knew was that his feelings for Cordelia were
rapidly changing.</p>

<p>They had made it half way to the campus when five
vampires jumped out from the bushes. Buffy leapt
into action before anyone else in the group could
react. She struck one of the vamps hard on the chin
with an upper cut knocking him to the ground. Another
vamp to a swing at her only to have his punch caught
and get flipped threw the air. She then leg swept one
before catching another with a round house. The
remaining standing vamp rushed at her only to find a
stake rammed into his chest as he got there. She then
quickly staked two of the vamps as they got back up of
the ground. Buffy connected with a round house with
the vamp that had just gotten to his feet to her left
sending him back to the ground. She then staked the
other vamp as after she flipped him to the ground for
a second time. The slayer then kicked the remaining
vamp in the head as he got to his knees sending him
rolling to his back before she finished him off. She
looked at the five piles of dust on the ground,
"That’s for what your master did to my Willow."</p>

<p>Vlad and Spike made their way from the moving van and
started walking towards one of the many dormitories
on the UC Sunnydale campus wearing the police uniforms
they had gotten from two of his newly risen children.
Quickly they made their way inside, and headed for the
first door on the floor. The master vampire turned to
his prodigy, "I believe this will do nicely," He said
as he began to knock on the door. When a young woman
answered the master vampyre smiled at her, "We have
few questions we need to ask, May We come in."</p>

<p>About a half mile from the campus Buffy stopped dead
in her tracks. The slayer let go off Willows hand and
stepped in front of her love, "You guys better get
ready."</p>

<p>The ten vampires that were walking down the road
towards them charged when they saw the Witch and the
Slayer had stopped. Buffy and the slayers in training
took fighting stances getting ready for the onslaught
when Willow tapped her lover on the shoulder. Buffy
turned to the Willow and the redhead spoke, "My turn."</p>

<p>Willow stepped up beside Buffy and pointed at the on
coming vampires with her right hand. Suddenly a
column of flame shot down from the sky and immediately
consumed the vampires. Buffy looked at her beloved
and took her in her arms, "Did I tell you I love
you.," Said the slayer before her lips pressed up
against Willows.</p>

<p>Tristin looked at Kathryn then the two watchers,
"Excuse me Mr. Giles."</p>

<p>"Yes, what is it," replied Giles.</p>

<p>"Do you get the feeling that we aren’t really needed"</p>

<p>Giles thought for a moment as he watched Willow and
Buffy break their kiss and once again take each others
hands. He then honestly answered the slayer in
training, "I’m beginning to, but the last two attacks
were no were on the level they had been. Also the way
the vampires reacted to us was very reckless they most
likely are very young if not newly risen. That
however will not be the case when we have to face Vlad
Tepes." </p>

<p>Vlad and Spike tossed the last couple of recruits in
the back of the van from the second dorm they had
visited. The master vampyre looked at the blonde
vampire, "This is turning out rather nicely, a few
more building like this one and we should be more than
ready to begin the move against the Witch and Slayer."
He then shut the door to the moving van, "William
shall we go find another."</p>

<p>"Yes Master," replied Spike before walking around the
corner of the van towards the drivers seat.</p>

<p>The patrol was almost to the campus when a group of
seven vamps stepped out from behind some trees. Buffy
pulled Mr. Pointy from her jacket and took a fighting
stance, just then all seven vampires turned to dust.
The slayer turned to Willow, "Way to go, I think I owe
you another kiss."</p>

<p>Willow smiled at Buffy, "I’ll take the kiss but it
wasn’t me."</p>

<p>Buffy looked at the group and saw that they were just
as perplexed as she was, "What’s going on here"</p>

<p>Before anyone could respond a male voice spoke from
behind her, "Maybe I can explain"</p>

<p>Buffy spun around to see a young man step out from the
tress, she looked at him for a moment then inquired,
"Who are you."</p>

<p>The man smiled at her, "I am Eamonn, and I can see by
the look on your faces that all of you have several
questions for me. Where would you like to begin?"</p>

<p>They all had taken their seats in the hotel room, all
eyes were locked on Eamonn as he stood in the middle
of the room, looking at Willow and Buffy, "I am
Eamonn,. a Druid high priest in the service of the
Goddess. The beloved Goddess has sent me here for two
reasons." Eamonn looked directly at Willow then
continued, "I have been sent to instruct you on how to
use your minds eye to developed and perfect your
magic," he then looked at Buffy, "Also I am to help
you discover your true nature."</p>

<p>Willow looked at him after he had spoken, "You said
you were a Druid, but there haven't been druids around
for a long time. How can that be?"</p>

<p>"Eleven hundred years ago I was taken into the forever
by the Goddess just as you were young Wiccan. However
I remained in the forever until just a few years ago
when the two of you first met one another. At that
time the Goddess returned me to the earth to await the
your calling."</p>

<p>"Eleven hundred years , are you immortal?"</p>

<p>"No I am of the same flesh and blood as you, the
reason for my appearance and long life is quite
simple, one does not age in the forever. However once
I was returned to the earth I once again began to age
just like most of you," replied Eamonn as he gave
Angel a quick glance.</p>

<p>Before Willow could ask him another question Buffy
looked Eamonn dead in the eye and spoke, "You said
that one of the reasons you were here was to help find
my true nature, what is that suppose to mean.."</p>

<p>"You are not what you appear to be," Eamonn turned
away from the girls and looked at Giles and the other
watchers, "Have any of you ever wondered why she has
outlasted any other slayer, or why she needed very
little training when called?"</p>

<p>The four men looked at one another as they thought
about the question Eamonn had just placed before them,
Giles looked over at Buffy and Willow, then turned to
Eamonn, "I believe she is the slayer that is to close
the Hellsmouths."</p>

<p>"That is her destiny however a slayer is not capable
of permeably closing a Hellsmouth."</p>

<p>Buffy jumped out of her chair barely managing not to
drop Willow, who just a second ago had been sitting in
her lap. She put the redhead down back in to the
chair and walked over to Eamonn, "What in the world
are you talking about, are you trying to say that I am
not the chosen one?"</p>

<p>As Eamonn started to speak everyone in the room was
glued to his every word, "You are the Chosen one, but
not a slayer."
Buffy cut Eamonn off before he could finish, "What is
that supposed to mean. How can I be the chosen one
but not a slayer, its not possible." </p>

<p>"No not only is it possible it is the reality of what
you are," Replied Eamonn. "The powers of light are
the source of the slayer and the Goddess herself
oversees them. In her infinite wisdom the Goddess saw
that the slayers did not possess the necessary skills
to permanently seal the Hellsmouths so when the time
came for you to be called it was the Goddess who
called you, not the powers of light." Eamonn walked
over to Buffy and put his hand on her shoulder, "Make
no mistake you were called as the chosen one. However
unlike all others before you your power does not come
from the powers of light but from the Goddess herself,
You child are her warrior, You are the Bladesinger.".</p>

<p>Buffy turned away from Eamonn as she tried to take in
what he was saying. She all the sudden found herself
doubting everything she knew, since the age of 15 she
had been told she was the slayer. Her calling had
taken away her innocence and cost her the life she
once had. Being the slayer had become her identity,
and now that was gone. She walked back towards
Willow, as she did her lover got up out of the chair
and walked towards her. When the two of them met
Willow embraced her beloved,. Buffy turned her head
towards Eamonn as Willow held on to her, "What am I?
What is a Bladesinger?"</p>

<p>"You are the Bladesinger, the chosen warrior picked by
the Goddess to fight against the darkness. That is
all that you need to know for now, we will talk about
this more once I begin the training, however at this
moment everyone needs to rest, when you all awake we
will move this operation to a safer place that I have
prepared, and the training will begin."</p>

<p>Everyone had left to go and get some rest and Cordelia
and Angel found themselves alone in her room. Angel
took her by the hand and looked into Cordelia's eyes,
"What is happening between us."</p>

<p>"I’m not sure but I think I might be falling for you.
When you were captured I didn’t know what was going
to become of you. I felt so lost and alone without
you around, it made me realize that I had feelings for
you that went beyond friendship."</p>

<p>"Lately I have found myself feeling the same way about
you, I think that I love you," Replied Angel</p>

<p>"Where do we go from here?" Asked Cordelia, unsure of
how to take what they had to a new level.</p>

<p>"I’m really not sure, but this would be a nice start,"
after he had finished speaking from his heart, Angel
leaned into her and softly kissed Cordelia on the
lips.</p>

<p>Vlad walked back and forth in front of his newly risen
army, "Soon we will strike and my revenge will be
complete, but first I must allow my children to become
stronger," Vlad paused then walked over to Spike,
"They need to be schooled battle tactics and
techniques so they will not perish as easy as the
others did. For now we will stay close to this area
and prepare for the Witch and the Slayer. I
underestimated them once but that will not happen
again."</p>

<p>"Yes Master"</p>

<p>Turning back towards the undead army Vlad once again
addressed the blonde vampire, "William I have a very
special job for you."</p>

<p>"What do you wish of me"</p>

<p>"I need to know just how powerful the witch is so I
have a gift for the slayer I wish for you to deliver."</p>

<p>"What is it master," asked a very puzzled Spike.</p>

<p>The master vampyre turned around and produced a hand
gun, "I wish to be the one to take her so stop short
of killing the slayer."</p>

<p>Spike smiled as he took the gun from the master
vampyre, &lt;This was going to be very enjoyable&gt;</p>

<p>The walls of the warehouse that Eamonn had taken Angel
to were now lined with several cots, each of them
having a small wooden crate next to it. Eamonn looked
at them as they stood in the middle of the room, "I
know that it is not much but for the last several days
I have been placing very powerful protection spells on
this building. It is most likely the safest place
around the Hellsmouth, so please find a place to rest
and get settled in for there is much to do and very
little time to do it in."</p>

<p>Eamonn then walked over to Buffy and Willow, "I have
prepared a place for the two of you in the office
upstairs," replied Eamonn as he pointed towards a set
of metal stairs.</p>

<p>Buffy looked up at the office at the top of the
stairs then at Eamonn, "Why do we get our own room
when everyone else including yourself has to share
this open area," she inquired, wondering why they were
getting special treatment.</p>

<p>"It is for your comfort and privacy. You are the
Bladesinger and she is your champion. For me to even
think of asking the two of you to give up such things
would be unforgivable."</p>

<p>The room had a twin size bed in it and there was a
small cabinet for them to put their belongings in. A
thick curtain covered the window that overlooked the
main area were the others were. The walls were
covered in Sigil’s and there was a circle drawn on the
floor next to there bed. The night stand had several
different kinds of candles sitting on top of it and
there were several very old books laying on a crate
in the corner of the room. Willow went over to the
crate and began looking the books over, "Buffy these
are amazing"</p>

<p>Buffy walked up behind Willow and wrapped her arms
around the redheads waste, she then stood on her tip
toes looking over Willows shoulder, "What are they"</p>

<p>"They're spell books from all over the world," replied
Willow as she continued to look through the ancient
books.</p>

<p>Eamonn watched as the two girls walked down the stairs
from their room, once they had reached the bottom of
the stairs he looked at them, "Come over here please,
it is time to begin your training."</p>

<p>When Buffy and Willow reached Eamonn he picked up a
long sword in a golden sheath and handed it to Buffy,
"This sword is just like any other sword. It has no
magical properties whatsoever, but in your hands it
will come to life. The power that lies within you
will make it sing your bladesong."</p>

<p>Eamonn held the long sword out to Buffy and she pulled
it from the Sheath, "It’s not doing anything"</p>

<p>"You must concentrate on the blade, close your eyes
and see it with your mind as you hold it in your hand.
You must become one with the blade to make the
bladesong be heard."</p>

<p>Buffy did as Eamonn said, she visualized herself
holding the blade and as she did she could hear the
blade begin to hum a sweet melody. Eamonn walked over
to her and spoke, "now child open your eyes and
release the bladesong that you have created."</p>

<p>Buffy opened up her eyes and looked at the sword she
held in her hands, she could feel the blades melody
pulsate through her body as it sang the bladesong.
She looked at Eamonn in bewilderment, "What is
happening."</p>

<p>"The Bladesinger within you has awaken, now do the
dance of battle," Answered Eamonn smiling as he
pointed to towards the metal body armor he had set up
on the far side of the room. </p>

<p>Buffy sprang into the Acton, quickly closing the gap
between her and the armor mock up. As she attacked
everyone could hear her sweet but deadly bladesong
fill the room. They all sat in amazement as the
melody filled played and Buffy reduced the armor to a
pile of useless metal. Eamonn smiled as he walked
over to her, "Well done Bladesinger, but real
opponents are much harder to defeat than empty armor,
continue to practice your bladesong so that you might
perfect it."</p>

<p>Eamonn then walked over to Willow, "Now child The time
has come for me to show you how to use your minds
eye."</p>

<p>Eamonn took Willows hand and led her over to the
circle. Once there he said a chant opening up the
circle’s magic and the two of them stepped inside.
Eamonn motioned for Willow to take a seat which she
did. The Druid high priest then sat accrosed from
her, "close your eyes child and follow my voice,"
Eamonn waited a few moments to allow Willow to
completely detach herself from their surroundings then
he continued, "Can you her me,"</p>

<p>Willow replied to the formless voice that spoke within
her mind, "Yes, but who are you and where are we."</p>

<p>"I am your guide, we are inside the core of your
mind, now follow my voice and I will lead you to the
minds eye."</p>

<p>Giles and the others sat their in silence as they
watched what was unfolding before them. On the far
side of the room Buffy was practicing with the long
sword, she moved with grace and precision as the
bladesong filled the room, it seemed as if she was in
a strange ballet with the sword.. In the middle of
the room completely unaware of what Buffy was doing
where Eamonn and Willow. It wasn’t the fact that they
seemed removed from the outside world as they sat in
the circle that caused everyone's minds to ponder what
was going on, it was the fact that the two of them
were floating three feet above the circle that did
that. Giles looked over at Collin and the others, "Do
you have any idea what is going on here,"</p>

<p>The council member looked at him, his face showed that
he was just as confused by what they were witnessing
as everyone else, "I am afraid not"</p>

<p>Eamonn voice spoke softly inside Willows mind, "Can
you see your minds eye"</p>

<p>"Yes"</p>

<p>"Focus on it, and see what it sees"</p>

<p>Willow did what Eamonn’s voice had told her to do and
she was amazed. She could see everything around her
without opening her eyes. Everyone in the room seemed
to be surrounded by a soft white light except Eamonn,
Buffy, Giles, Angel and herself. She and Eamonn were
surrounded by a white blue mist, a similar mist
surrounded Giles but it seemed considerably weaker
than hers and Eamonn’s. Angel had no aura at all, and
When she looked at Buffy she didn’t see the soft light
that surrounded the others but a intense light filled
with all the colors of the rainbow, the light that
came from Buffy was so bright she had to turn away
form it in fear that she might be blinded. "What is
happening"</p>

<p>"You are seeing your friends with your minds eye. The
light that surrounds them is their life force"</p>

<p>"What of the blue mist"</p>

<p>"It is the life force of magic, the more powerful the
magic the stronger the mist will be"</p>

<p>"What about Angel"</p>

<p>"He is a vampire, even with a soul his life force is
long gone"</p>

<p>"And what of my beloved, why is her life force so
different"</p>

<p>"She is the Bladesinger, what you see is not only her
life force but the strength and power that the Goddess
gave her when she was called. I would not look at it
to long however, her aura is also a natural weapon of
the Bladesinger , it is meant to blind the minds eye
of anyone who would attempt to use magic against her."</p>

<p>"But I would never harm her"</p>

<p>"I know, but it is a natural defense, she can not
control it and it is always there to shield her from
the minds eye of those who are of magic."</p>

<p>Vlad watched as Spike talked with several of his
children about what they needed to accomplish tonight.
The master vampyre smirked as his mind visualized the
damage that his favorite child was going to do to the
slayer. He was sure the witch would be able to heal
the slayer but how quickly she did would let him know
just how powerful the witch had become, and what he
needed to do to destroy her.</p>

<p>Buffy wore the golden sheath containing her long sword
at her side as she and Willow walked hand in hand
towards the campus on patrol. Eamonn walked on the
other side of Willow as the others closely followed
behind them. Suddenly Buffy stopped and pulled the
sword from it’s sheath, as soon as she did it began
it’s deadly melody. Willow turned to her beloved,
"What’s wrong"</p>

<p>"We have company," replied the Buffy.</p>

<p>Ten vampires came out of an ally to their right as
another ten came from behind some hedges to their
left. In front of them were twenty vampires led by
Spike. Giles and Archer took aim with their
crossbows as Xander pointed a super soaker at Spike
and Kathryn and Tristin both took fighting positions
as they produced stakes .</p>

<p>Spike stood there watching the group preparing to
defend itself, he was temporally memorized by the
melody that seemed to come from the slayers sword. It
cut into his very being and his inner voice cried out
to him to get out and get back to the master. He was
about ready to flee when he recalled why he had been
sent, He had a job to do for the master.</p>

<p>Buffy stood there wondering what was going on, the
vampires were not attacking, or even showing any signs
that they planned on attacking. She was just about to
spring into action when spike spoke and got her
attention.</p>

<p>"I come with a message from the master," replied the
blonde vampire as he reached into his coat.</p>

<p>What," Buffy shouted at him pointing the sword at him,
as it sang her bladesong.</p>

<p>Spike found that it took everything he had to pull the
gun out from underneath his jacket as the melody of
the Bladesong filled his mind. He also notices that
the other vampires were slowly backing up from the
group, trying to get as far away as possible from the
slayer and the sword she held in her hand. He took
aim at Buffy and yelled, "This is the message," as he
opened fire on the slayer.</p>

<p>Willow screamed as she saw Buffy hit the ground. The
redhead immediately dropped to her knees next to her
fallen love and took the blonde in her arms as tears
rolled down her cheek. Giles and Archer let go with
the crossbows and took about two vampires as they were
running away. Eamonn said a quick chant that burst
eleven of the retreating vampires into flames, then
knelt down next to the two girls. The rest of the
group quickly surveyed the area and saw that Spike and
the rest of the vampires had safety escaped after he
had shot Buffy. Giles and Xander then quickly rushed
over to their fallen friends side with the others
right behind them.</p>

<p>Willow looked as her beloved laid in her arms
bleeding. She could her the bladesong coming from the
sword begin to weaken as Buffy started to fade into
unconsciousness. She saw that Buffy had been hit
several times and was rapidly losing blood, she
looked at Eamonn as tears freely flowed down her face,
and pleaded with the druid high priest, "She’s dying,
how can I save her." </p>

<p>Eamonn softly spoke to Willow, "Do as you did before
when you healed her but this time use your minds eye
to see what it is use wish to do."</p>

<p>Willow placed her hand upon Buffy’s chest and closed
her eyes. As soon as she did a golden mist surrounded
the blond and the bullets from Spikes gun rose out off
her body. The wounds that they had made closed behind
them. Willow then looked deeper into herself with her
minds eye and healed the internal damage that Spike
had done. She opened her eyes and looked down at
Buffy when she heard the bladesong start up again.
Her beloved was now healed, she reached out with her
hand and helped Buffy to her feet. </p>

<p>"Thanks Wills, I guess I owe you another one" Buffy
said as she wrapped her arms around Willow.</p>

<p>"Well after tonight I know how you can repay me,"
replied a very serous Willow</p>

<p>"How" Smiled Buffy hoping she Willows answer was what
she was thinking of.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow we get you some body armor" </p>

<p>Buffy looked at Willow and saw that she had her
resolve face on, "It’s as good as done," replied
Buffy. Willows answer was not the one she had hoped
for, but that didn’t bother her much. She knew Willow
only wanted her to be safe and besides she figured
Willow should get double repayment on this one.</p>

<p>Buffy placed the sword back into its sheath and took
Willows hand in her own, "I think that is about enough
for tonight, how about you"</p>

<p>"Yeah, let’s call it a night"</p>

<p>The two of them then walked past the others as they
headed back towards the warehouse. Giles looked at
Eamonn, "What now."</p>

<p>"The Bladesinger and her champion have made their
decision, I suggest that we return with them."</p>

<p>After they had departed Vlad stepped out from the
shadows, clenching his fist he screamed into the night
over what he had seen. Not only was the traitor with
them but he had been completely healed. To make
matters worse The witch was extremely powerful but the
slayer appeared to be more powerful than any slayer he
had ever seen. What had that strange man called him
her, a Bladesinger. Vlad didn’t know what it men but
he knew that it threw an unexpected twist into his
revenge, he would have to re-think how he was going to
destroy the two of them. He then walked of towards
his lair trying to get the haunting melody of the
bladesong out of his head.</p>

<p>Hatred filled the master vampyre’s eyes as he paced back and
forth accrosed the main room of his lair, He could barely believe what had
happened. The witch was indeed powerful but the slayer , as she held her
sword and it played it’s deadly melody for all to hear
had frightened him, and that was simply was not suppose to happen. He was
Vlad Tepes Dracul, the master of all vampyre, it was he who
brought fear to the hearts of all who crossed his path. Vlad
slammed his fist through the concert wall of the lair as he screamed
out in pure rage, "She is only a girl and I will destroy her."</p>

<p>Buffy stood there watching Willow as she sat at on their bed. The
redhead smiled at her and got up and walked over to her and wrapped
her arms around her Buffy, "A penny for your thoughts"</p>

<p>"I was just thinking about what happened tonight, and about me
getting a vest"</p>

<p>Willow took a step back from Her love and gave the blonde her best
resolve face "You're not changing your mind, are you?"</p>

<p>Buffy placed her hands on the redheads shoulders and began to softly
massage them as she spoke, "I am still going to get a vest but
your getting one too."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You're taking the same risk I am by going out there, so your
getting a vest," Replied Buffy.</p>

<p>"Then I guess it is vests all around," answered Willow as she
stepped back up to Buffy and once again wrapped her arms around the blonde.</p>

<p>Buffy softly pressed her lips against Willow, "I love you"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I kinda figured that. I love you too" replied Willow
before she returned Buffy’s kiss.</p>

<p>Eamonn looked around the table at Collin and the watchers, after he
had looked each one of them in the eyes the druid high priest
spoke, "I believe you have a few questions for me."</p>

<p>"Yes, we do. It is about Ms. Summers and Ms. Rosenberg,"
replied Collin</p>

<p>"You mean the Bladesinger and her champion," corrected Eamonn.</p>

<p>"Actually that is part of our question, what exactly is happening
here. I know you said that Ms. Summers is the Bladesinger, and that
Ms. Rosenberg is her champion but what exactly does that all
mean."</p>

<p>"As I have already told you, The Bladesinger is the chosen
warrior of the blessed Goddess. Her destiny is to forever seal the
Hellsmouths, but she can not do that alone. She needs a champion,
someone to care for her, to magically protect her, and to fight by
her side. Does that help any."</p>

<p>"Not really, you only repeated what you said earlier"</p>

<p>Eamonn’s face showed nothing but seriousness as he looked Collin
dead in the eyes, "I have told you everything you need to know, if you wish
anymore knowledge of Bladesinger and her champion I suggest you take it up
with the Goddess."</p>

<p>Collin was now extremely frustrated from the lack of information they
were getting from the druid and it showed as he spoke, "How are
we to aid them if we do not understand fully what they have become. It is
our duty as council members and watchers to guide and train the
slayer, we can not do that if we do not what her abilities are."</p>

<p>"You are to aid them as you have been doing over the last several
days. Support the Bladesinger and her champion, do your research to
help unravel the mystery of the master vampyre, and help on the
patrols." Eamonn then stood up and placed both his hands on the
table, he leaned over towards Collin maintaining eye contact the
whole way, "That however is where your responsibilities and
duties end. You barely understand the slayers, do you really think the
Goddess would allow you to watch over those she has called. The
council is neither capable nor worthy to oversee the Bladesinger and
her champion, That is why I was sent."</p>

<p>Collin leaned back in his chair, the world as he knew seemed to end
as the druid high priest spoke, everything that he had dedicated his
life to now appeared to be over, they were no longer needed.
Collin looked around the table at his comrades, the looks of
despair on their faces told him that he was not alone, "What
are we suppose to do when this is all over, being watchers is all we
know."</p>

<p>"Most of you will do as you have always done and oversee the
slayers"</p>

<p>"I don’t understand, you just said that you were sent by the
Goddess to do that."</p>

<p>"No, you are mistaken. I said I was sent for the Bladesinger and
her champion, I said nothing of the slayers."</p>

<p>"But Ms. Summers is the currant slayer"</p>

<p>Eamonn's was becoming agitated by the fact that Collin didn;t seem to grasp
what he was saying, "No she is the Bladesinger, there is no active slayer at
this time," He pusaed for a moment and continued, "but in time one will be
called."</p>

<p>Eamonn then turned away from Collin and looked at Giles, "Do you
recall when I said that most of you would continue as you always
have"</p>

<p>"Yes" responded Giles, unsure of where this was going.</p>

<p>"It is time for us to talk," replied Eamonn as he motioned
for Giles to follow him.</p>

<p>Vlad had been sitting by himself for hours going over in his mind
what he had saw and trying to formulate a plan on how he could
destroy the two girls. Suddenly it jumped straight up from his seat
and spun around in mid air. When the master vampyre landed on the
ground he was looking Directly at Spike, "William, I know how to
destroy them"</p>

<p>"How master"</p>

<p>A sinister grin came accrosed Vlad’s face, "I will use the
Hellsmouth against them. I will open it and allow just enough of the demons
through to weaken the witch and the slayer. Then I will close it and wait
for the two of them to become weak from the fighting , then I shall destroy
them."</p>

<p>"Master, I do not understand why you would wish to close the
Hellsmouth once you have opened it"</p>

<p>"The demons of the Hellsmouth are not my children, the are
beneath me and have no place in the new order," Vlad walked over to the
blonde vampire and continued, "Know these truths William, we are
vampyre, the rulers of the night, all other creatures are subservient to us.
I will use the demons to accomplish what I need them to but beyond that I
have no use for them."</p>

<p>Vlad then walked away from Spike and lifted his hands above his
head, "The world will be mine alone to rule, and in the end there can
only be vampyre."</p>

<p>As the group was preparing for another night of patrolling Buffy and
Willow cornered Angel and Cordelia, "We have a question for
you," stated Buffy.</p>

<p>"Go Ahead," Replied Angel</p>

<p>"What‘s up:"</p>

<p>"You will have to be a little more specific, Buffy," stated
Angel, even though he knew where the blonde was headed..</p>

<p>"What's going on, with the two of you?"</p>

<p>Angel looked at Cordelia who gave him the nod to go ahead,,
"It’s complicated"</p>

<p>"Since when is anything about you not complicated, now spill"</p>

<p>"We are in love with her"</p>

<p>Cordelia grabbed Angel by the hand then spoke, "It’s true, we
both just recently realized that we love one another"</p>

<p>Willow looked at them and smiled, "That's great, we‘re happy
for you"</p>

<p>"Buffy then cut in on Willow, "Just keep good care of each
other."</p>

<p>"We will," Angel and Cordelia said in unison, both of them
pleased that their friends were supporting them.</p>

<p>Joyce and Shelia now sat at the table making small talk as they tried
to take their minds off the fact that Buffy and Willow were out there
in the darkness with the monsters that roamed the night. It was hard
on them as when they had to watch their daughters walk out that door,
knowing that they might not make it back.. They had both come to
realize that Buffy and Willow had to do what they did and were proud
of them for it, but still that didn’t make the waiting any easier.
The two women dreaded it when the sun had went down once again
because it had sent out their daughters to once again brave the
night and face the master vampyre and his children.</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow both sported their newly acquired body armor as they
once again walked hand and hand on patrol. As the group made its way
towards the campus Giles was finding it difficult to focus on the
task at hand. Eamonn's words were playing over and over in his
mind, the druid had said that it was not his destiny to be a
watcher, that he like Buffy and Willow had a higher purpose to
fulfill. That he stood at the gateway of a new life and the time was
fast approaching for him to claim his destiny. Giles was unsure of
what Eamonn was talking about because the druid had ended the
conversation by saying that now was not the time to reveal his
calling and that they would talk again more in the morning, so now
all he could do was wait and wonder about what laid on the road ahead
of him.</p>

<p>On the other side of town, Vlad and Spike stood in front of the high
school. The master vampyre looked at Spike and spoke, "So
William
this is where the Hellsmouth is its weakest."</p>

<p>"Yes Master"</p>

<p>"Then shall we begin"</p>

<p align=right><a class=link href="#top">Top</a></p>

<table cellspacing=0 width=100%>
<tr><td class=h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 16: Hell on Earth</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The air was filled with the putrid stench of sulfur as Vlad watched
demons of all shapes and sized emerge through the dark cloud of smoke
that poured from the Hellsmouth. After a half hour of the seeing
the demonic host enter his realm the master vampyre turned to
Spike, "William I believe there are now enough of these inferior
creatures to weaken our foe," He then walked into the black smoke
that engulfed the Hellsmouth.</p>

<p>Spike stood there not believing his eyes, just a few short moments
after his master had walked into the Hellsmouth the thick dark smoke
began to retreat back into the Hellsmouth as it started to close.
The blonde vampire looked the master vampyre as he stood over the
crack in the ground that just a few moments before had been a open
Hellsmouth. Master, I did not think it possible for a Hellsmouth to
be sealed so easily?"</p>

<p>"One can not seal a Hellsmouth my child, I only closed."</p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<p>"I am Vlad Tepes Dracul, through me that which is thought to be
impossible becomes reality. Now William let us go and wait for the
demons I had sent forth to accomplish their task," said Vlad full of
himself, convinced that this plan could not fail.</p>

<p>The patrol stopped dead in their tracks as a seven foot green and
black demon, followed by three smaller reptilian looking demons with
razor sharp claws, approached from the south. Six more of the
reptilian demons approached the group from the north as Buffy removed
her sword from the sheath and the deadly ballad of the Bladesinger
began. As the Bladesong filled the night air Buffy sprang into
action attacking the green and black demon with all her might. The
demon took a powerful swing at her with his left arm only to have
Buffy's sword slice through it at the elbow, sending half its arm
falling to the ground. As the demon howled out in pain she drove the
sword deep into his chest, and he began to shake violently for a
moment then exploded covering the Bladesinger in entrails.</p>

<p>Willow focused on the reptilian demons coming from the north as Giles
and Archer fired their crossbows at them. The stakes from the cross
bows were dead on target and struck two of the demons in the chest
but only made them scream out in pain. Giles shouted out to the
others, "Stakes are not going to do us any good against them, it`s
going to have to be hand to hand."</p>

<p>Willow reached out towards the demons and they burst into flames as a
barrage of fire poured down on them from the sky. Willow then turned
around to aid Buffy but became mesmerized by the stunning blonde.
Her lover looked more radiant than ever as she fought the three
reptilian demons. Buffy's movements were not only graceful but
enchanting and the Bladesong that seemed to strike fear in the hearts
of anyone or thing that faced the Bladesinger beckoned to Willow as
if it were a sweet melody playing just for her. She found herself
unable to concentrate on anything but Buffy's beauty as the
Bladesinger swiftly cut down her foe.</p>

<p>After the last demon had fell Buffy returned the blade to it's sheath
ending the Bladesong, she then turned and faced the group,
immediately she noticed the intense passion that played in Willow's
eyes as the redhead stared at her. She walked over to her beloved
and took the redheads chin in her hand, "You O.K. sweetheart?"</p>

<p>It took Willow a moment to break out of the trance she had fell in as
she watched her beloved fight the demons and realize that Buffy was
talking to her, "What?"</p>

<p>Concern for what was going on with Willow filled Buffy's mind as she
repeated her question, "Are you O.K. sweetheart?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm O.K. It's just that when I saw you fighting I wasn't
able to concentrate on anything but how beautiful you are," Willow
hung her head down and continued, "I'm sorry."</p>

<p>Buffy lifted Willows head back up so she was looking directly into
Willows eyes, "You got nothing to be sorry for, in fact I am really
flattered." Buffy then gently kissed Willow on the lips only to have
the redhead take a step back.</p>

<p>Buffy stepped towards Willow closing the gap between them that her
love had created, "What's wrong you never did that before"</p>

<p>A tear rolled down Willow's cheek and she replied to Buffy in a
broken voice, "You don't understand, while I was watching you I was
unable do anything, I wanted to help you with the demons by I
couldn't, all I good do is stand here and watch you."</p>

<p>Buffy let Willows words sink in then wrapped her arms around her
beloved, "It's going to be OK, we'll figure out what happened," She
then turned her head towards Eamonn, "What's going on here?"</p>

<p>Eamonn walked over to the two girls and waited for them to break
their embrace. Once they did he spoke, "She was effected by your
bladesong, it usually strikes fear in the hearts of those who hear it
but because of the love that you have for one another your champion
heard a different bladesong than the rest of us, a special melody met
to be shared between the two of you. That bladesong amplified her
love for you and she momentarily became lost in her passion."</p>

<p>Eamonn then looked right at Willow, "I know you did not mean it to
happen, but in the heat of battle is not the best time for the two of
you to share the bladesong. If you find yourself once again becoming
enchanted by the bladesong you must use your minds eyes to detach
yourself from it's melody, it is the only way you will be able to
regain your concentration and help her."</p>

<p>"How do I do that?"</p>

<p>"When the bladesong begins to flood your mind use the emotions that
it is generating for the Bladesinger to focus your minds eye, but you
must do it quickly so you will not become lost in your love for her.
Once you have used the love you have for the Bladesinger to focus
your powers they will be greater than anything you have done to this
point."</p>

<p>Joyce and Shelia both paced the floor of the warehouse nervously as
they waited for the parole to return. Both their faces expressed the
deep concern they had over their daughters having to go out and face
the darkness that Vlad Tepes had brought to the Hellsmouth. Every
fiber of their being cried out to the Goddess to watch over Willow,
Buffy, and the others and return their children and friends to them.</p>

<p>Buffy once again pulled her blade from it's sheath as twenty demons
formed a semi-circle in front of them. Most of the demons were
similar to the reptilian demons they had faced earlier with the
exception of three of the green and black demons and a eight and half
foot gray demon that had wielded a rather large long sword and had
sharp spikes protruding all over its body. Buffy cautiously moved
towards the demons with Angel, Kathryn, and Tristin close behind. </p>

<p>The bladesong grew louder as she approached their foe and all the
demons except the large gray one took a few steps back from the
approaching Bladesinger. The gray demon suddenly lunged at her with
his blade but she quickly blocked his attack and countered. The
demon managed to block her initial attack, only to have three of the
spikes severed from its body by her follow up attack. Buffy then
spun in a complete circle slashing deep into the demons chest and
decapitating a nearby reptilian demon. </p>

<p>Willow could hear Buffy's bladesong begin to fill hear mind and she
quickly focused the feelings it was producing towards her minds eye.
She felt a wave of energy sweep over her and her right hand began to
emitted a bright blue glow. The redhead then pointed her hand
towards the three reptilian demons who had broken past Buffy and the
others. A flash of light shot out from her finger tips and vaporized
the demons as soon as it hit them.</p>

<p>One of the green and black demons swung widely at Angel. The
brooding vamp found that it was everything he could do to fend off
the demons aggressive attack. The demon knocked him to the ground
with a powerful left hook, but Angel managed to leg sweep the demon
as he got back up to his feet. He grabbed the demon's right arm as
it started to get back up and snapped it in two places, causing the
beast to scream out in anguish.</p>

<p>Kathryn and Tristin were fighting one of the reptilian demons and
holding their own when three others jumped them. Both of the girls
quickly found themselves overwhelmed as the reptilian demons claws
began to cut into their flesh from all directions. Tristin fell to
the grown bleeding from the several claw marks that covered her body,
she could feel a coldness sweeping over her as the scene around her
began to fade. Kathryn looked over to her fellow slayer in training
and saw that the other girl was in just as bad a shape as she was.
She then looked up at the four reptilian demons who where hovering
over them, and she knew that the two of them were about to die. She
closed her eyes and awaited her fate, but nothing happened.</p>

<p>Buffy sliced deep into the gray demon's leg causing him to drop to
the ground. The demon looked up at her and saw the Bladesinger blade
rapidly coming towards its head. The demon brought its sword up to
block the attack. Buffys bladesong played louder than it ever had
before as she connected with the demon's weapon. When the two blades
struck the sword the demon was holding broke in half as Buffy's blade
continued on its deadly path towards the demon.</p>

<p>Willow saw Angel snap a green and black demon's neck as four
reptilian demons began to rapidly approach him. She waved her hand
through the air and the four demons imploded before they could reach
the brooding vamp. She then quickly scanned the battle area and
located Buffy. Her love was standing in a pile of demon remains
fighting the remaining green and black demon. </p>

<p>Buffy slashed the demon accrosed the chest then connected a round
house kick to its head sending the beast flying backwards into two of
the reptilian demon's. Before any of them could get back up Willow
lifted both her hands in the air and a column of fire shot down and
consumed the three demons.</p>

<p>Kathryn hear a voice tell here not to worry that she and the other
slayer in training were going to be alright. She opened her eyes to
see Eamonn standing over them as a golden mist came from both his
hands. She could feel her wound closing as the mist covered her body
and after a few moments she felt Eamonn grab her hand, to help her
up. She looked over were her fallen comrade was and saw Buffy helping
Tristin up as Willow stood by the her side.</p>

<p>Eamonn turned towards the rest of the group, "Archer you are to take
the two slayers in training and the young man with the Super soaker
back to the warehouse. The Bladesinger, her Champion, Giles, Angel,
and myself will finish this patrol."</p>

<p>"Why with all these demons out tonight, you will need all the help
you can get," replied Archer.</p>

<p>"Yes, but none off you except the Bladesinger is equipped to battle
demons, stakes and holy water do not have the same effect on them as
they do on vampires. All what will happen if you stay is that you and
the others will continue to sustain injuries that require immediate
care. While myself and the Bladesinger's Champion are fully capable
of healing everyone it is a tremendous drain on our magical energies
to do so and we most likely will need all the power we can muster to
continue to battle the demons tonight."</p>

<p>Archer looked at the druid high priest for a moment, then spoke "I
think I understand but what makes you think their will be more demons
tonight, this is an inactive Hellsmouth after all"</p>

<p>"From what we have seen so far I do not believe that is the case
anymore. I fear that somehow the Hellsmouth has opened. Right now I
am not sure how that happened but I suspect that the master vampyre
is behind it."</p>

<p>Shortly after Archer and the others had left a group of ten demons
reptilian demons rounded the corner followed by a slimy yellow demon
and a purple demon with rather large claws and a mouth full of razor
sharp teeth. As soon as the demons spotted the group the purple one
rushed them. Buffy yanked her sword out and charged towards the
oncoming demon as Eamonn and Willow both sent bolts of energy flying
at the reptilian demons.</p>

<p>Buffy side stepped as the purple demon lunged at her, the beast flew
past her and landed on its face. She kicked him in the head as he
started to get back to his feet, then took off his right arm with her
blade before he hit the ground a second time. The demon howled out
in pain as he got to his knees. Buffy kicked him in the head with a
round house as she spun around an drove her blade through the yellow
demon who had tried to sneak up on her. She then pulled out the
blade as the yellow demon dropped to his knees. The Bladesinger
swung her sword in as hard as she could as she spun in a full
circle. Giles, Eamonn, and Willow all stood there and watched in
amazement as that one movement took off both the demon's heads.</p>

<p>Eamonn looked at Buffy as her bladesong filled the empty ness of the
night, "It would appear that your skills are improving with every
battle, if this keeps up they will be complete before the night is
over."</p>

<p>Giles turned to Eamonn, "How is that possible, how can she complete
her skills in one night?"</p>

<p>"With the Goddess all things are possible," Replied Eamonn</p>

<p>Anya ran up to Xander and gave him a big hug as Archer and the other
returned from the patrol Xander looked at his girlfriend and
smiled, "I take it you missed me"</p>

<p>"That would be a good guess," she replied as the two of them began to
kiss.</p>

<p>Archer walked over to the table that Collin, Megan, and Hughes were
sitting at and took a seat only to find himself surrounded by Joyce,
Shelia, and Cordelia, all three women demanding to know where
everyone else was. The watcher looked at the women then back to
Collin, "They are still on patrol, Eamonn sent us back because we
were not properly equipped to fight the demons and were getting
wounded"</p>

<p>Collins had every tone of seriousness imaginable when He spoke, "Did
you say demons?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid so, it appears that that Vlad Tepes has somehow opened
up the Hellsmouth."</p>

<p>Everyone in the room grew silent as it sunk in, the Hellsmouth was
open. They all felt a sense of doom coming over them realizing that
it was no longer just vampires that their friends and family were out
against, that they now faced whatever demonic creature had crawled
from the abyss one the Hellsmouth was opened.</p>

<p>Shortly after Archer and the others had left seven green horned
demons and eight foot black rushed them from a group of trees.
Buffy once again pulled the sword from it's sheath, As she did the
bladesong began to play, stopping their demon attackers dead in their
tracks. Buffy moved in quickly and took out two off the green
demons before they knew what was happening. The black demon hit her
hard from behind just as she was driving her blade through another
one of the green demons. She rolled over to her back and
somersaulted backwards away from the advancing demon. The remaining
four green demons charged towards Willow and the others, not wanting
to have anything to do with the haunting melody that was filling
their heads.</p>

<p>As the demons rushed them Willow waved her hand in the air and they
all burst in flames. She then heard Giles scream from behind her.
Willow and Eamonn both spun around to see that several of the
reptilian demons had snuck up on them and were attacking Giles.
Eamonn waved his hand and six of them burst into flames, but before
he could cast another spell a black and green demon tackled him from
behind.</p>

<p>Willow waved her hand in the air vaporizing the rest of the reptilian
demons. She then turned to help Eamonn and came face to face with a
gray demon who picked her up and flung her in to the bushes. The
gray demon then rushed towards her, Willow barely had enough time to
create the energy field that sent the demon flying backwards.</p>

<p>Angel saw what was happening and attacked the gray demon as he hit
the ground. He shattered the beast left shoulder with a solid flying
kick. He then grabbed the sword it had been carrying and sliced off
the demon's head with it. </p>

<p>The black demon tackled Buffy as soon as she landed on her feet
knocking the sword out of her hand. He then began to strike her
repeatedly as she tried to get back to her feet. Buffy managed to
get her leg under the demons and placed her foot firmly into the
beast belly. She then grabbed him by the shoulders and flipped him
off of her. She quickly got back up to her feet and rushed to
retrieve her sword.</p>

<p>Willow crawled out from the bushed just in time to see Angel knock
the demon off of Eamonn. The brooding vampire then rammed the sword
into the demons back causing it to explode, sending entrails flying
all over the place. She then noticed Giles laying on the ground
barely moving and started to rush over to see if he was OK when she
noticed the absence of Buffy`s bladesong. She instantly was gripped
with panic as she unsuccessfully scanned the area for her beloved.</p>

<p>The black demon picked himself up off the ground and turned to face
the blonde girl who had thrown there only to find she had
disappeared. The demon began surveying the area but was unable to
locate her, so he started to make his way towards the others.
Suddenly the Bladesong once again filled his mind, the demon froze in
mid step and began to rapidly scan the area for the girl. Then he
felt the coldness of a metal blade as it penetrated through his back
and pierced his dark heart.</p>

<p>Willow felt a flood of relief come over her as she heard the
Bladesong start up again. She turned towards the direction it was
coming from to see her beloved standing over what used to be a black
demon. Seeing that there were no more demons in the area she didn't
bother to refocus the bladesong. Instead she stood there allowing
her and Buffy's melody to cloud her mind. Everything she had felt
earlier on patrol came back to her as she once again was memorized by
the Bladesong. She saw her beautiful lover walking towards her, and
noticed each and every graceful step of the Bladesinger.</p>

<p>Angel stood there watching Buffy and Willow as Eamonn began to heal
the wounds the demons had inflicted on Giles. After a few moments
the task was done and Eamonn and Angel helped Giles to his feet. The
three men then turned and watched as Willow wrapped her arms around
Buffy. Buffy then wrapped her left arm around Willow and held her
blade in her right allowing it to continue playing the sweet melody
that now was filling both their minds. </p>

<p>Eamonn looked at Angel and then Giles, noticing the look on both
their faces that said what are we suppose to do know, he answered
their unasked question, "Allow then to have this moment."</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow walked up front and Angel, Giles, and Eamonn trailed
behind them as they made their way along the crack in the earth that
was the Hellsmouth. "Eamonn I have a question for you," stated Giles.</p>

<p>"Go ahead"</p>

<p>"Why did you have me stay when you sent the rest back, I am in the
same boat they were in."</p>

<p>"That is true, but I need you here to not to fight but to witness the
battle."</p>

<p>"Why"</p>

<p>"It has to do with your destiny. Now that the Bladesinger's Champion
has learned to use the bladesong to strengthen her magic she is fully
awaken and the Bladesinger is very close to becoming fully awakened.
Once that is done my duty here is over. I of course will stay and
help against the master vampyre but after that I must return to the
forever. When I do they will need someone to watch over them and to
give them advise, and you are the one most suited for that job."</p>

<p>"I barely have a grasp on what is happening with them, there is so
much I don't understand and my knowledge of magic and how to use it
is very limited. How could I possibly watch over them"</p>

<p>"When I leave you are to accompany me to the forever, there the
Goddess will show you the path that you are destined to walk"</p>

<p>Before Giles could ask Eamonn what his last response met they heard
several low guttural grows coming from some nearby hedges which were
quickly drowned out by the rhythmic sounds of the bladesong. A
rather large orange and yellow demon emerged from the bushes with a
dozen of the reptilian demons and six of the green horned demons in
tow.</p>

<p>The larger demon made its way slowly towards Buffy growling all the
way. She immediately began her dance of the bladesong quickly
striking the beast in the shoulder with her sword sending a yellow
ooze down his arm. The demon the struck at her but she blocked his
blow, then thrust her sword into the beast belly, causing the demon
to stumble backwards as it howled in rage. The creature then began
swinging wildly at her trying to knock her down. Buffy used her
sword to block everyone of the demons punches, severely cutting up
its arms and hands in the process.</p>

<p>Willow raised her hands in the air and used the bladesong to focus
her magic towards the approaching demons. The ground around the
demons began to tremble causing them to fall down. A crack in the
earth beneath them appeared and quickly opened up and swallowed all
eighteen of the demons and then closed back up on itself as if it was
never there. A stunned Willow looked at Eamonn, "What just happened?"</p>

<p>"How should I know, you were the one who cast the spell. What did
you want to do to them?"
.
"I wanted to send them back to hell where they came from"</p>

<p>Eamonn`s voice was filled with enthusiasm over how powerful the
champion had become when he spoke, "Then it would appear that is
exactly what you did." </p>

<p>"But how was I able to pull off something that powerful?"</p>

<p>"As I told you earlier, your magic is greatly increased when you use
the Bladesong that you share with the Bladesinger to focus it. It is
that power created by your love for one another that will allow the
Hellsmouths to be sealed forever."</p>

<p>The large demon howled out in pain it felt the Bladesinger's sword
strike hard against its chest. The demon fell flat on its back and
Buffy quickly raised her sword up above her head and thrust it down
hard into the demon's heart. She then resheathed her sword and
walked over to Willow, "What are you guys talking about," She asked
as she pulled Willow into a hug.</p>

<p>"Eamonn was just telling me how we are to seal the Hellsmouths."</p>

<p>"Sounds interesting, how," asked Buffy as they began to walk away
from the area to continue the patrol.</p>

<p>Eamonn came to a stop as they walked along the Hellsmouth near the
school, "This is the place"</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow turned around to face him, "What do you mean," asked
the blonde.</p>

<p>"This is the part of the Hellsmouth that the demons came from, but
for some reason it appears to be closed once again."</p>

<p>"How do you know that."</p>

<p>Eamonn looked at Buffy, "I can see it with my minds eye," he then
looked into Willows eyes, "Use yours to see what I see."</p>

<p>Willow walked over to where Eamonn was standing, then began to focus
her minds eye n the Hellsmouth. She could see the energy that
surrounded it and how it had been recently opened then shut by some
dark mystical force. "He's right, I can see it."</p>

<p>Eamonn took Willow by the hand and lead her over to Buffy, "I need
you to play you Bladesong so that your champion can seal the
Hellsmouth so that it can not be opened again."</p>

<p>Buffy pulled the sword from it's sheath starting up the Bladesong.
As their melody filled Willows mind she took it and focused her minds
eye. The redhead then turned to the Hellsmouth and once again
looked at the dark energy that surrounded it. She then took the love
that she and Buffy had for one another and surrounded the darkness of
the Hellsmouth with it. She could see the power that the two of them
shared slowly engulfing the negative energies of the Hellsmouth. </p>

<p>Eamonn walked over to Buffy, "She needs your help."</p>

<p>"How do I help her."</p>

<p>"Go to her."</p>

<p>Buffy walked over to Willow and placed her hand on her loves
shoulder. When she did Willow felt the energy from Buffy's touch
increase the power that she was projecting on the Hellsmouth. After
what seemed forever all Willow could see with her minds eyes was the
natural energies of the earth, the Hellsmouth had been sealed.</p>

<p>Buffy placed her sword back in its sheath and turned to Eamonn as she
held Willow in her arms, "Well it looks like we just fullfilled my
destiny."</p>

<p>"No, that was only one of many," replied Eamonn.</p>

<p>Cordelia sat there waiting for Angels return. She knew that he could
keep care of himself but that did little to ease the worry that
flooded her mind over the vampire. She got up and walked over to one
of the windows of the warehouse, gazing out of it into the night sky
she wondered when He wouild get back to her and hope that he had not
gotten hurt. </p>

<p>Vlad sat in the main room of the lair, filled with pride over what
he had accomplished, the demons he sent out would weaken the two
girls powers enough for him to safely strike against them and get his
revenge. His sinister smile radiated the essence of evil as he
though about how he would first kill the slayer and then strike the
witch dead. His revenge was now so close he could taste it, &lt;Soon
the new order will begin.&gt;</p>

<p>The five off them stood outside the door to the warehouse, each of
their faces showed the strain that the nights battle had taken on
them. They were completely exhausted and every muscle in their
bodies ached. Willow and Buffy were leaning up against each other
for support as Angel opened the door to the warehouse. They then
walked in to rejoin their friends, glad that they had survived the
Hellsmouth but wondering what tomorrow had in store.</p>

</table>

<p>Cordelia sat down on Angel's lap and wrapped her arms around her newfound
love. The concern she had for Angel rapidly increased as Buffy’s words from
last night ran through her mind, (Vlad has went to far first he almost takes
Willow from me, then he hurts her by murdering her father, and now this.
The time has come to end it.) Cordelia tilted her head towards Angel and
pressed her lips softly against his.</p>

<p>Angel smiled at Cordelia and inquired about the unexpected kiss, "Not that I
mind but what was that for?"</p>

<p>"For good luck."</p>

<p>Angel grinned and then pulled her closer to him, "I think I am going to need
all the luck I can get."</p>

<p>Cordelia smiled at Angel as she leaned in for another kiss, "I think that
can be arranged."</p>

<p>After Buffy had finished her morning exercises she walked over to her and
Willows bed. She bent over her sleeping lover and woke up the redhead by
delicately. She smiled at Willow as she ran her hand accrosed her beloved
forehead, "Time to get up sleepy head."</p>

<p>"Do I have to?"</p>

<p>"Yes, everyone else is most likely already up by now, and we should go over
what we need to do tonight."</p>

<p>"Can’t I lay her a little longer," replied Willow, who did not want to get
out of bed quite yet.</p>

<p>"Only if you an give me a good reason why"</p>

<p>Willow sat up in bed and put her hand on the back of Buffy’s head then
pulled her into a passionate kiss.</p>

<p>After the kiss broke Buffy slid up next to Willow and wrapped her arms
around her beloved, "I think another hour or so of waiting won’t kill them,"
she replied before she returned Willow’s kiss.</p>

<p>Eamonn sat accrosed the table looking at Giles, "You know that my time here
is coming to an end. The Bladesinger wishes to face the master vampyre and
make him pay for the pain that he has caused her and her champion."</p>

<p>Giles voice was filled with worry for his two surrogate daughters as he
spoke to the druid high priest, "Are they ready to face him?"</p>

<p>"Both the Bladesinger and her Champions skills are complete, I believe Vlad
Tepes will be in for quite a surprise when he faces them."</p>

<p>"That’s good but I still have one concern about them facing the master
vampyre. I have always told Buffy that she should always go into battle
with a clear head and I think her motivation to face him takes that away
from her."</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

<p>"She seems caught up in making Vlad pay for what he did to Willow, the fact
that he is the master vampyre or that he was strong enough to open then
close the Hellsmouth appear to be of no concern to her. I am afraid she
might rush in their with nothing but vengeance on her mind and Vlad Tepes
might be able to use that to his advantage."</p>

<p>Eamonn sat back in his chair and smiled, "You are going to make them a very
good advisor. Your concern for them is strong and your advise is sound.
However you still have much to learn about the Bladesinger, but that will
have to wait till you accompany me to the forever. For now I will do what I
can to put your mind at ease. Yes Vlad Tepes opened the Hellsmouth and
closed it, but they destroyed everything that came from it and then sealed
it for all time. It is revenge that the Bladesinger seeks. In her mind it
was Vlad Tepes not the awakening that caused her to be separated from her
champion, and it was Vlad Tepes who made her beloved hurt by killing the
girls father. She is aware of what he did with the Hellsmouth but to her
that was just another way that he endangered her beloved. So while it might
be vengeance that drives her to face him, it is her love for her champion
that fuels that vengeance. It is the same love that enabled the two of them
to seal the Hellsmouth, and that love that will help her destroy the master
Vampyre."</p>

<p>"I think I'm begining to understand, but I have another question. How will
their love for one another aid in the master vampyre’s destruction?"</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen the power that can be called upon when someone is trying
to protect or avenge those who they care the most about?"</p>

<p>"Yes"</p>

<p>"Then imagine what the Bladesinger, the chosen warrior of the Goddess
herself, is capable of doing when she feels that someone has harmed her
soulmate."</p>

<p>As Giles sat back in his chair and pondered the words of the druid and
smiled as he began to realize what Eamonn was saying. Vlad Tepes would soon
meet his match, instead of facing a Slayer and a witch he was going to face
a infuriated Bladesinger and her Champion.</p>

<p>Over a hundred vampires stood in the main chamber of the master vampyres
lair awaiting for the sun to go down. Looking at the army he had created
Vlad knew that the time had come to destroy the Witch and her slayer. The
master vampyre turned to his prodigy and spoke, "The demons have had an
entire night to complete their task, the time for my revenge has come,
Those two girls will not see another sunrise."</p>

<p>An evil smirk came accrosed Spikes face, "And neither will her precious
friends, Master."</p>

<p>"Yes, soon they all will be dead then the new order can begin."</p>

<p>As the sun began to give way to the night Buffy and Willow marched hand in
hand towards the campus. behind them where Angel, Eamonn, and Giles all of
them armed with broad swords and stakes. Xander and Archer were next, both
men carried super soakers loaded with holy water and wore swords at their
side. The two slayers in training brought up the rear wielding crossbows
and carrying an assortment of stakes and arrows.</p>

<p>The secret door that lead to the master vampyre’s lair was thrust open as
Vlad and his children stormed into the night. There was going to be no
mayhem or feeding tonight, for they marched through the darkness with one
purpose, to destroy the witch and the slayer.</p>

<p>Back at the warehouse they sat in silence, their hearts agonized over their
friends and family who were now out there with the master vampyre and his
dark forces. They knew that their was really nothing they could do now but
appeal to the Goddess in their behalf and hope that she would return safely
return them. So they said their prayers to her and waited, each of them lost
in a sea of despair.</p>

<p>The two groups stood there facing one another just outside the Sunnydale
campus, each one waiting for the other to make the first move. Buffy slowly
pulled her sword from its sheath and raised it above her head. The melody
of the bladesong played louder than it ever did as it pierced through the
darkness. As the vampires felt the haunting ballad of the bladesong and
began to back away from the patrol, Willows hands began to radiate a bright
blue light as she focused her energies on the ballad she and Buffy shared.</p>

<p>Vlad stepped forward, rage filled his eyes as he pointed towards Buffy and
screamed out in fury, "She is only a girl, I command you to attack!"</p>

<p>The vampires stopped their slow retreat as soon as their master had spoken.
The bladesong gave them no desire to get close to the Slayer and her friends
but their will was not their own and they were compelled to obey their
master, so they did the last thing they wanted to do and charged their foe.</p>

<p>As the vampires charged them Tristin and Kathryn both fired their crossbows
into the incoming flood of vampires as Xander and Archer opened up with
their super soakers. Two vampires explode into dust as the slayers in
training's stakes pierced their hearts and another three fell to the grown
screaming before they were reduced to ashes by the holy water from the super
soakers.</p>

<p>Buffy looked at Angel and Giles, "Stay here and don’t let any of them get to
Willow." She then charged the advancing force with her bladesong proceeding
out before her striking terror into the hearts of the vampires.</p>

<p>Willow raised her right hand to the sky as Buffy charged the undead army
and a large ball of fire appeared above her, she then moved her hand
towards the vampires sending the ball of fire smashing into their ranks. As
it hit twenty of the vampires fell to the ground, their bodies were ravished
by fire for a few seconds before turning them to dust. Eamonn then waved
his hand through the air and ten of the vampires turned to dust.</p>

<p>Buffy gracefully swung her sword through the air decapitating two vampires
and almost slicing another one in half, leaving him screaming on the
ground. She then came around with her sword and ran it through two vampires
dropping both of them to their knees. Buffy then spun in a full circle as
wildly swinging her blade, taking the heads off of four more vampires.</p>

<p>As Buffy fought Willow focused all of her power on her beloved sending up an
invisible energy shield around the Bladesinger. Eamonn looked back at the
two slayers in training, who had just fired another round of stakes towards
the vampiric army, "Reload but don’t fire. The champion is protecting the
Bladesinger, you must not allow any of Vlad’s forces to get to her." He
then turned back towards the vampires and sent a bolt of lighting down that
vaporized two of them.</p>

<p>Spike hit Angel accrosed the chin sending him stumbling back a few steps
before he regained his balance. He then kicked at Angel with a round house
but his sire blocked it. Angel then opened up with a series of jabs that
Spike managed to block. The blonde vamp then came back with a right hook
that was blocked by Angel who got in a solid blow to the abdomen. As Spike
bent over, Angel hit him with both fist accrosed the back of the head
knocking the blonde vampire to the ground. Spike quickly rolled over and
sprung to his feet, only to get hit in the chin by a solid jab.</p>

<p>After Giles staked the vamp he had knocked to the ground he felt a strong
blow hit him accrosed the jaw. The watcher fell to the ground and rolled
backwards away from the vampire who had struck him. The vamp went to leap
on top the watcher before he could get back only to be turned into dust in
mid air by Eamonn. The Druid High priest looked at him, "Get behind me and
guard the champion with the slayers in training, I will do my best to see
that it does not become necessary to for you to fight."</p>

<p>Buffy had cut through the core of the vampires and stood face to face with
Vlad Tepes. He could feel her cold stare pierce through him as her
bladesong evaded his mind momentarily causing him to lose his concentration.
Buffy swung straight for his head as her blade howled through the night
air, the master vampyre was barley able to re-focus his attention in time to
duck and avoid being reduced to ashes. He looked up at Buffy and smiled as
three of his children crept up on her, however his smile turned to shear
terror when his children went to grab her and were turned to dust by the
unseen force that surrounded her. Vlad screamed to his remaining forces,
"You have to get to the witch she is protecting the slayer!"</p>

<p>Eamonn waved his hand sending several bolts of lighting into the remaining
vampire army as they charged towards them he then through up his hands
sending three vampires who were almost on top of him flying back into a
group of five of their brethren that were rapidly advancing. As Eamonn
waved his hand in the air and reduced the eight vampires to dust another six
of them rushed past him on an intercept course with Willow.</p>

<p>Angel connected a right hook knocking Spike to the ground, but the blonde
vamp managed to kick his legs out from under him before he could finish the
attack. Spike then rolled over quickly and knocked the stake out of Angels
hand and reached to grab it. Angel grabbed Spike and pulled him back before
he could reach the stake, he then head butted the blonde vampire knocking
Spike off of him. He then got to his feet and reached for the stake, as
soon as he had it in his hand he felt Spikes grab him by the ankles and pull
him face first into the ground.</p>

<p>Vlad looked at Buffy as he pulled a sword from his belt, "So the slayer
wants to play with swords, I can’t wait to run you through.."</p>

<p>Buffy pointed her sword at the master vampires chest, "That’s not going to
happen, prepare to pay the price for hurting my beloved."</p>

<p>Vlad swung his sword at Buffy only to have it easily deflected. He quickly
found himself on the defensive as he attempted to fight of the onslaught of
the slayer. Buffy sliced deep into Vlade’s arm sending the master vampyre
into a tirade of slavic curses as he blocked her next two attacks. Vlad then
managed to get a swig past Buffy only to be thrown backwards by the energy
that shot through his sword as he struck Willows protective field. Buffy
moved quickly and elegantly towards him as if she was dancing to the melody
of the bladesong. The master vampyre barely managed to get his sword in
front of him in time to stop Buffys sword from slashing into his neck.</p>

<p>Tristin and Kathryn both fired at the vampires reducing two of them to dust as
Archer and Xander took out another two with their super soakers. Cut into
one of the two remaining vampires with his swords as Tristin threw a
powerful punch sending the other one stumbling backwards. Kathryn quickly
rushed over to aid Giles as the vampire he was fighting knocked the sword
from his hand.</p>

<p>The vampire regained his balance he lunged at Tristin, the slayer in
training jabbed her stake into him as their bodies collided. As she fell
backwards to the ground she saw the vampire burst into dust and knew that
she had been on the mark with the stake. The other vampire knocked Giles to
the ground and was preparing to finish off the watcher when he got hit from
behind. The vampire then spun around and saw Kathryn standing there for
about two seconds before he felt the wooden stake plunge into his heart.</p>

<p>Spike let go of Angels feet as soon as his foe hit the ground then quickly
sprung forward onto the other vampires back. Angel arched his head back
driving the back of his skull into the blonde vampires nose. He felt Spike
hop off his back and quickly got up and spun around. Spike was holding his
broken nose and yelling out in pain. Angel then grabbed him by the back of
the neck and lifted Spikes head up so he could see him face to face. "This
is for all the pain and misery you have caused," growled Angel as he rammed
a stake into the blonde vampire.</p>

<p>Eamonn looked around and saw that only the master vampyre remained, he then
turned around and saw the other standing in a protective circle around the
Bladesingers champion. So he walked over to Giles and turned to watch the
battle.</p>

<p>Angel looked and saw that all his friends were just standing their watching
as Buffy fought the master vampyre. He ran over to Eamonn, "Why isn’t
anyone helping her?"</p>

<p>"This fight is between the Bladesinger and Vlad Tepes, besides she is
already getting all the help she needs from her Champion," Replied Eamonn as
he pointed towards Willow.</p>

<p>A fine blue mist encircled Willows entire body as she gazed at her beloved.
Her mind was completely focused on the Bladesinger and she was unaware
of anyone around her as she continued to project the protective field around
Buffy.</p>

<p>Vlad felt the sword cut through his side and howled out in agony. Buffy
then rammed her blade into the master vampyre’s chest dropping him to his
knees. Vlad tried to counter with a powerful swing but Buffy easily blocked
it. She then disarmed him by severing the hand that the master vampyre was
holding the sword in.</p>

<p>Vlad looked down at his sword and back up at Buffy. He could feel the
bladesong cut through his mind enveloping him in fear. The terror of
knowing he was about to die filled the master vampyre's face as he looked at
the blonde girl who had beaten him, "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I’m Buffy Summers, chosen warrior of the Goddess. I am the Bladesinger,"
replied Buffy just before she sent Vlad Tepes Dracul to hell where he
belonged.</p>

<p>Willow heard the sweet melody of Buffy’s bladesong stop and immediately
snapped out of the trance she had put herself in to find her beloved
standing in front of her. Willow then collapsed into Buffy’s arms totally
exhausted from all the energy it had taken her to maintain the protective
field around her beloved.</p>

<p>As Willow fell into Buffy she quickly grabbed her and wrapped her arms
around the redhead. Using her body to support Willow Buffy softly whispered
in her loves ear, "Sweetheart, are you alright?"</p>

<p>"I’m fine, I just am pretty tired from the protection spell."</p>

<p>Buffy kissed Willow on the forehead, "Well then I need to get you back to
the dorm so you can get some rest."</p>

<p>"We're not going back to the warehouse?"</p>

<p>"No, Vlad is no more. It’s safe for us to return to campus now."</p>

<p>Buffy then looked at Eamonn and Giles, "I trust that you have no objections,
not that it really matters because I intend to be alone with my beloved
regardless of your answer."</p>

<p>Eamonn smiled at the Bladesinger then replied, "Go, the two of you need to
be alone, but before you do I wish to tell you that it was an honor to be
allowed to help awaken you and see your powers grow."</p>

<p>"Your leaving aren't you."</p>

<p>"Yes, this world has not been my home for a long time, and you no longer
require my service. My place is with the Goddess in the forever and that is
where I must return to."</p>

<p>Buffy helped Willow walk as the two of them made their way over to Eamonn,
"Thank you, for everything. I don‘t know what we would have done without
you."</p>

<p>"Your welcome"</p>

<p>Willow looked up at Eamonn as she rested against Buffy, "What are we to do
now."</p>

<p>Eamonn put his hand on Giles shoulder, "Take a vacation you earned it and
when Giles returns he will explain everything to you."</p>

<p>"Giles, is leaving?" both girls asked in unison.</p>

<p>"Yes, but only for a short while. He is to be my successor. He will act as
advisor and mentor to the two of you and the knowledge that you need to
serve the Goddess will be given to him. However in order for him to recieve
it he must accompany me to the forever."</p>

<p>There then was a bright flash and both Eamonn and Giles were gone.</p>

<p>I talked to Wesley today, he told me that the powers of light have finally
called a slayer and that the council is once again back in business. I
believe from what I saw of her when we were fighting Vlad Tepes that Kathryn
will make an excellent slayer, especially with Archer as her watcher. I
wish the both of them the best of luck.</p>

<p>January 7, 2001</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow closed the third Hellsmouth today and we will be leaving
Argentina and going to Los Angeles for Angel and Cordelia's wedding before
heading to Germany and the forth Hellsmouth. From what I learned
in the forever I believe that we still have approximately twenty three
remaining Hellsmouths, I believe most of them are inactive like the one in
Argentina so hopefully it will not take much longer to seal them. The
hardest part has been locating them even with the divining rod the Goddess
gave me it has not been easy to locate them.</p>

<p>January 16, 2001</p>

<p>Angel and Cordelia’s weeding was a total success even though it took place
at one in the morning. However it did get Buffy and Willow thinking and
they finally set a date for their own wedding. Both the girls Moms were
overjoyed that they are finally tying the knot, and I have to admit that that
I am pretty happy myself. It is about time they took that final plunge.</p>

<p>February 21, 2001</p>

<p>We finally located the fourth Hellsmouth and closed it. Now we are heading
towards Austria were I believe the fifth Hellsmouth is. Hopefully we will
be able to keep up this pace and put an end to these Hellsmouths forever.</p>

<p>May 9, 2001</p>

<p>We are still searching Austria for the fifth Hellsmouth. I know we are
close but it has been inactive for a long time and is well hidden. I pray
that we will find it soon so we can move one to the next one and close it
before the wedding in September.</p>

<p>May 21, 2001</p>

<p>We Finally located the fifth Hellsmouth and sealed it and Will be heading
towards Germany tomorrow. From what I have learned in our travels I believe
that their are two Hellsmouths in this country. One around Berlin and
another at Bonn. It would appear however that we are once again fortunate
and that both of them have been inactive for awhile.</p>

<p>July 11, 2001</p>

<p>Well the Hellsmouth outside of Berlin is sealed and now we are heading
towards Bonn. Buffy and Willow are running up a rather large phone bill as
they plan the wedding with their moms but the council; is more than willing
to pay for it, though they do not have much of a choice since the Goddess
made them subservient to the Bladesinger, though I think Buffy is enjoying
her new relationship with the council a little to much, after all it is not
really necessary to insist that they ensure that each hotel we go to have
fresh doughnuts waiting. She says after what they did to her when she was a
slayer they should be glad she doesn’t make them deliver the doughnuts in
person.</p>

<p>August 2, 2001</p>

<p>The sixths Hellsmouth is now sealed and we are going to take a break and
head back towards Sunnydale so the girls can get ready for their wedding. I
find myself getting more excited each day it grows closer, I can barely
believe they both asked me to give them away. I am more than happy to do it
and hope that I will be able to help make their wedding day a memorable one.</p>

<p>September 3, 2001</p>

<p>The ceremony was fantastic, the best part was when I got to toast Buffy and
Willow Summers. It was nice to see everyone expectably Xander and Anya. It
was the first time the three of this got to see their daughter Victoria in
person. I am going to stay in Sunnydale for a couple of weeks as Buffy and
Willow go on a Caribbean cruise for their Honeymoon.</p>
