<!-- Fire and Ice \ Part 3 -->

<P>Danielle awoke the next morning disoriented. Memories of the previous night, came flooding back. Her body ached
from the beating she had received, confirming that it hadn’t been a dream. She looked in wonder at the woman asleep
in the chair beside her. She was the most attractive woman Danielle had ever seen. It was as if this dark beauty
had stepped out of her dreams. A warrior sent to protect her, she fantasized. A calm washed over her, when she
thought of this woman staying with her the entire night, insuring her well-being. She had never felt so safe, so
protected.</P>
<P>Her muscles complained, stiff from being stationary. She needed to shift her position, but hesitated, not wanting
to awaken the woman. As if sensing her thoughts, Alex opened her eyes. Danielle was momentarily stunned by the
blue she saw there.</P>
<P>&quot;How are you feeling?&quot; Alex asked.</P>
<P>The sound of the woman’s voice was like a balm to her soul. He mind went blank for an instant. The troubled
expression on the woman’s face brought Danielle back to her senses. &quot;I’m better. I... I don’t know how to
thank you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I was just in the right place at the right time.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don’t even know your name.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There wasn’t much time for formal introductions last night.&quot; She smiled warmly. &quot;Alex, Alex
Lord.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Danielle Stafford.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex gently pulled her hand from under the young woman’s cheek. Danielle flushed with embarrassment. It had
felt so natural against her skin that she hadn’t realized she was still holding it.</P>
<P>Alex smiled. Flexing her fingers, &quot;I’ll need these if I’m going to fix breakfast.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle’s stomach perked up at the mention of food. It felt abysmally empty. When Alex went to the kitchen,
Danielle gingerly made her way to the bathroom. She was shocked when she looked in the mirror. Her nose was swollen
and both of her eyes were back and blue. She opened the robe and winced at the ugly bruises on her abdomen and
ribs. It could have been a lot worse. She had been incredibly fortunate.</P>
<P>Enticed by the aroma of chicken soup. She made her way to the kitchen. &quot;Mmm, something smells wonderful.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Chicken soup out of a can. I’m sorry, but I’m not much of a cook.&quot; Alex apologized, placing a bowl
in front of the woman.</P>
<P>&quot;This is great, thanks.&quot; Danielle began eating with a fervor that warmed Alex’s heart. It was clear
she relished every bite. Alex passed her the bread and watched while she finished the entire pot of soup and half
a loaf of bread.</P>
<P>&quot;Good to see you have an appetite.&quot; She was fascinated by the way Danielle’s eyes sparkled when she
smiled.</P>
<P>&quot;I’m always able to eat, believe me.&quot; Danielle commented, flashing her beautiful smile again.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I see.&quot; Alex lifted a brow playfully. There was something completely disarming about the young
woman’s demeanor. Alex found herself looking at her longer than was appropriate. She stood up and began cleaning
the dishes.</P>
<P>Danielle stretched cautiously. Amazed how much better she felt. &quot;That miracle drug you gave me last night
really helped. Are you a doctor?&quot;</P>
<P>Alex hesitated. &quot;Not really. I hope you’re not going to turn me in for practicing without a license.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are you kidding? It would have been a rough night without your help.&quot; Danielle shivered involuntarily
as she thought how close she had come to being raped. &quot;Where did you learn to fight like that?</P>
<P>&quot;It’s just something I picked up.&quot; Alex replied and tried to shift the direction of the conversation.
&quot;Why were you walking alone in that part of town?&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle blushed. There was no way she could explain the park thing. &quot;It’s a long story. But this wasn’t
a random attack, he knew me. I called the police the night before last when he nearly beat his wife to death.&quot;
She frowned. &quot;I can’t believe he’s out walking the streets already.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If it’s any consolation, he won’t be walking that well this morning.&quot; Alex smiled, rather pleased
with the vision.</P>
<P>&quot;I found that the police aren’t very effective in dealing with these situations.&quot; Danielle was puzzled
by her friends reluctance to get the police involved, but after all Alex had done to help her she didn’t press
it.</P>
<P>&quot;It’s hard to understand what drives a person to such violence. I went to see his wife at the hospital
last night, she’s in pretty bad shape. They had to deliver the baby early and weren’t sure if the child would make
it. It’s so tragic. What a way to come into the world.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex couldn’t meet her gaze. &quot;Violence is all some people understand, they don’t have any good in them.
One way or another, this baby is better off without that kind of father, believe me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don’t agree. Everyone has good in them, deep down. Even he deserves a second chance, an opportunity
to get help.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex decided not to argue the point and wondered if she needed to believe just a little of what Danielle had
said. &quot;It’s sunny outside. Feel like having a cup of coffee on the porch?&quot;</P>
<P>They sat out on the deck that wrapped around the back of the house. It had a magnificent view of small lake
only a hundred yards off.</P>
<P>Danielle sat back in the wicker chair, letting the sun warm her achy muscles. &quot;This is a wonderful place
you have.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thanks, actually I’m only renting. I won’t be staying much longer.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle tensed at the news. &quot;You’re moving?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah, I never stay in one place very long. I get restless.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle tried not to let her anxiousness show and changed the subject. &quot;What do you do for a living?&quot;</P>
<P>Alex hadn’t prepared herself for a conversation with the woman. She used an old standby. &quot;I just got out
of the service. I’m between jobs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That must be where you learned to handle yourself so well, huh?&quot;</P>
<P>Alex nodded. Uncomfortable with the lie, she stood, attempting to divert the focus of the conversation. &quot;I’m
about ready for a refill. Can I get you one?&quot; Alex walked inside effectively avoiding further questions.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">*****</P>
<P>Detective Sands rushed into Bowin’s office and tossed a file on his desk He looked up to find her grinning ear
to ear.</P>
<P>&quot;We got a break on the Palanos robbery.&quot; His eyes brightened with interest.</P>
<P>&quot;We really got lucky on this one. The guys in vice picked up some rich boy on drug charges. Turns out his
father is a jeweler. In an effort to save his sorry-ass son, he offered information on a recent robbery. He agreed
to give the name of a fence who sold him the items, if the charges were dropped against he and his son.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Who’s the fence&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Our old friend Sal.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Call Judge Brennen. Let’s get a search warrant.&quot;</P>
<P>Marisa winked and handed Bowin the warrant. &quot;I thought you were going to say that.&quot;</P>
<P>He smiled outright. &quot;What would I do without you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Beats me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let’s go get him.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">*****</P>
<P>Alex rummaged through her clothing looking for something that would fit Danielle. The best she could do was
a T-shirt and pair of sweats. She also grabbed a pair of underwear. Danielle was sitting on the couch, staring
into the fire. She looked up when Alex came into the room.</P>
<P>&quot;I think I’ve managed to find some clothes for you. They're no a fashion statement, but they should do
for the trip home.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle was quiet. The idea of going home to her empty apartment right next door to her attacker frightened
her. Alex noticed the change in the young woman and sat beside her. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I... It’s just the thought of going home... He’s my neighbor.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex cursed herself for being insensitive to the young woman’s fear. The pained expression on Danielle’s face
made her want to take the young woman into her arms and comfort her but she held back. &quot;I’m sorry, I should
have thought... I... you’re welcome to stay with me as long as you need to.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don’t want to be a bother... I’ve been too much trouble already. I just...&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You haven’t been any trouble...&quot; Alex tried to think of something to say that would make Danielle
feel better. &quot;I've enjoyed your company. It’s been nice having someone around to talk to.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle glanced at her hopefully. &quot;Really?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I’d like it if you stayed.&quot; Alex realized with some surprise that she truly meant it.</P>
<P>&quot;Thanks... if I could just stay the weekend?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As long as you want.&quot; Alex watched the young woman visibly relax. &quot;I have one condition though.
I want you to get these underclothes on so that I can take a look at your bruises. I want to make sure you’re healing
properly.&quot; Danielle heart swelled at Alex’s concern.</P>
<P>She beamed. &quot;I’ll get changed.&quot;</P>
<P>While Danielle was in the bathroom dressing, Alex went to the bedroom to retrieve a jar of homemade salve from
her medical bag.</P>
<P>&quot;Okay doc... I’m ready.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex smiled. &quot;Hop on the bed and lie down.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle did as she asked, suddenly feeling a little self-conscious. Alex sat beside her and examined the bruises
on her face. The swelling had gone down from this morning, but she still looked like the loser in a boxing match.</P>
<P>&quot;I’m going to put a little salve on the cuts and bruises. The pressure may hurt a little, but the salve
itself is painless.&quot; Alex dipped her finger in the jar and began to apply the ointment with gentle strokes.</P>
<P>Danielle closed her eyes and braced herself for the pain. She was sore, there was no getting around it. But,
the physical discomfort was forgotten as she became acutely aware of the softness of Alex’s fingers and the tenderness
in her touch.</P>
<P>She opened her eyes. Alex was leaning over her, blue eyes focused on the task. Her fingers were so attentive
that it brought to mind the intimacy of a lover’s caress. Danielle felt the surface of her skin heat.</P>
<P>Her glance dropped to Alex’s mouth. Her full lips were parted slightly. She wondered if they could possibly
feel as soft as they looked. Danielle wanted to know. She felt an urge to press her lips to Alex’s and fought to
suppress it, but she couldn’t help thinking about what lay beyond her lips. What would this amazing woman taste
like? Her body was melting under Alex’s touch. It tingled all over. She stiffened, afraid she would not be able
to control the sensations building inside her.</P>
<P>Alex pulled back. &quot;I’m sorry... did I hurt you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Just a little,&quot; Danielle lied. &quot;But it’s okay.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I’m done with your face, I’m going to take a look at your ribs and stomach. Ready?&quot; Danielle nodded.</P>
<P>Alex’s hand hesitated momentarily at the tie of Danielle’s robe. She flashed back to the robbery and forced
her mind to clear. Her finger trembled slightly when she causally attempted to open the front. As she looked down
at Danielle’s slender form, her eyes lingered on the firm, well proportioned body. Alex gently ran her fingers
over the ribs. Although Danielle was terribly bruised, the skin was not broken. She slowly began to cover each
bruise with the medicine.</P>
<P>Danielle clenched her teeth to stifle a moan. Her body was alive with sensation. She could feel her nipples
harden against her bra, so sensitized that the material felt coarse against them. The muscles of her lower abdomen
tightened and she felt a warm moisture building between her legs. She could not believe what was she was experiencing.
Was this what other people felt? It was incredible. She glanced quickly at Alex, praying she hadn’t noticed. Alex
was focused on her task.</P>
<P>Danielle had never in her life felt anything so wonderful. Her skin burned everywhere Alex touched. With each
stroke her arousal increased. She felt a spasm between her legs and held her breath, terrified her body would betray
her feelings.</P>
<P>Alex felt Danielle flinch and assumed she was in pain. She tried to hurry along. At last, she finished. When
she removed her hand, Danielle’s body trembled. Alex quickly closed her robe.</P>
<P>&quot;You’re going to be fine. Nothing’s broken. You’re healing well. I want you to apply this salve twice a
day until the bruises begin to fade.&quot; She handed her the jar.</P>
<P>Alex noticed the oddest look on the young woman’s face. She let it pass without comment. Danielle had been through
a lot in the past few days. It had taken its toll. Danielle needed rest and time to allow her body to heal. Alex
stood up reluctantly.</P>
<P>&quot;You should try to get some sleep. I’m afraid I don’t have much in the house to eat. I’m going out to get
groceries. I thought I’d pick up Chinese food for dinner… if you like it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sounds great!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Okay then, I’ll be back in a little while.&quot; Alex closed the door quietly behind her.</P>
<P>As soon as the door clicked shut, Danielle released an audible sigh. Her body hummed with a newfound energy.
The physical excitement pulsing through her was intoxicating. She pulled the comforter over herself and let her
hand slide under the elastic of her underpants. Her inquisitive fingers slid lightly across her sex. She withdrew
them from the slippery wetness and curled up on her side. A single tear hit the pillow. Alex had just awoken her.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">*****</P>
<P>When Alex returned she noted the subtle aroma of incense. Danielle had also set the table and started a fire.
Suddenly the cabin felt like a home to her. Not since she was a child had she come home to find someone waiting
for her. It reminded her how alone she had been and it hurt to realize that soon she would be alone again. Danielle
would return to her life, as would she. She squared her shoulders and went to the kitchen. She found Danielle there,
brewing a pot of coffee.</P>
<P>&quot;I thought you were going to get some rest?&quot; Alex questioned.</P>
<P>&quot;I did sleep for a little while... I had a nightmare and...&quot;</P>
<P>Alex put down the groceries and turned to face the young woman. &quot;You don’t have to worry about him hurting
you. I know his kind. He’s a coward. You’ll never see him again. In fact I doubt he’ll return to his apartment.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle hugged herself rubbing her hands along her arms in an attempt to rid herself of the chill that enveloped
her. &quot;I hope you’re right. Just thinking about going home makes me nervous.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I would never take you back there, if I thought it weren’t safe.&quot; Alex spoke with more emotion than
she had intended. She felt the heat rise to her face and shifted uncomfortably.</P>
<P>&quot;Anyway, I hope you're hungry. There’s a lot of food here.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle smiled, relieved to have something else to focus on. &quot;I’m always hungry.&quot;</P>
<P>After they put the groceries away, they sat down to eat. Alex handed the young woman a pair of chopsticks.</P>
<P>Danielle had never used them before and watched Alex for a few bites before giving it a try. After a few attempts,
she was successful at grabbing a pea pod and lifted it carefully. It was almost to her mouth when the sticks separated,
sending it flying toward Alex who gracefully snagged it in mid air with her own chopsticks. Danielle looked at
her in amazement.</P>
<P>&quot;Wow, you’re really good with those!&quot;</P>
<P>Alex winked. &quot;Just one of those unusual skills I’ve picked up.&quot; Danielle looked regretfully at her
empty sticks. Alex smiled and held the morsel out for her to eat. Danielle opened her mouth in grateful acceptance.
As Alex slid the chopsticks from Danielle’s lips, their eyes met. Danielle felt the spark between them and glanced
down.</P>
<P>&quot;Maybe I should get you a fork.&quot; Alex said clearing her throat.</P>
<P>&quot;No, I want to give this a chance. Let me try again.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex walked up behind her and leaned down. She placed her hand over Danielle’s molding her fingers into the
proper position. &quot;It’s just a matter of applying the correct amount of pressure.&quot;</P>
<P>Her hair draped down, tickling the young woman’s neck. Danielle felt Alex’s breath against her skin and realized
if she turned her head, their lips would nearly touch. She felt a rush of heat and fought to stay concentrated
on her task. With Alex steadying her fingers, she made it all the way to her mouth.</P>
<P>&quot;See? Nothing to it.&quot; Alex released her hand and sat back down. &quot;Now, try it on your own.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle looked reluctantly at her friend. &quot;Something tells me this is going to be the longest meal in
history.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex smiled.</P>
<P>Danielle poked at her food and tried to sound casual. &quot;So you said you were leaving soon. Where are you
moving?&quot;</P>
<P>Alex hesitated momentarily. &quot;I’m trying to decide between a couple of places.&quot; She quickly changed
the focus of the conversation. &quot;It depends on what I decide to do career wise. What about you? What do you
do?&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle had finally gotten the hang of eating with the strange instruments and hurried to finish a mouthful.
&quot;I work at the Sentinel.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A reporter, huh?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, not yet. I’ve been stuck writing obituaries for the past six months, but I just got the go ahead
to do my first article.&quot; Danielle paused thoughtfully. &quot;I really don’t think of myself as a writer. I’m
more of a storyteller. People’s lives and adventures fascinate me. My whole life I’ve been intrigued by exciting
and dangerous tales.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex watched Danielle with interest. She enjoyed the animated way she spoke, using her hands and body with great
flourish. &quot;It’s good they’re finally giving you a chance.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah, this is a big break for me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So, what’s the story about?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Battered women who have survived and turned their lives around. I hope that victims of abuse who read
it find comfort in hearing how others have escaped and gone on to happier lives. Maybe they’ll be encouraged to
do the same.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You like helping people.&quot; Alex stated.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, yes. These women are so brave. They have triumphed over such adversity. Their stories really touched
me.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex got up to pour coffee. &quot;So do I get a preview of the article?&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle’s face lit up. &quot;Sure.&quot;</P>
<P>They sat by the fire while Danielle spoke about the women’s lives. Alex was moved. But it wasn’t just their
stories that captivated her, but the skill with which Danielle related them. She had a wonderful ability to bring
their experiences to life. Alex felt like she was watching their stories unfold. She found herself touched by the
tragedy and inspired by their courage. Alex could visualize the women, feel their pain and appreciate their achievements.</P>
<P>Much later that evening, Danielle finished, nearly breathless. Her face was flushed with excitement. &quot;I’m
sorry, I really ran on.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don’t apologize. You were wonderful. You really have a gift.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle blushed, flattered. &quot;A gift of gab maybe.&quot; She smiled.</P>
<P>&quot;I think these women are fortunate to have you telling their stories. It’s great that you’ve found your
niche.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle had a talent for drawing people out, getting them to talk about themselves. But, so far she’d been
unsuccessful with Alex. Whenever she tried, Alex became uncomfortable and changed the flow of the conversation.</P>
<P>&quot;Have you found yours?&quot; Danielle questioned.</P>
<P>Alex smiled cynically. &quot;I’ve found what I’m good at. I’m just not happy doing it anymore.&quot; She stood
anxiously. Danielle could almost feel the walls go up.</P>
<P>&quot;I’ve kept you up long enough. You need your rest. I’ll grab a blanket and sleep on the couch.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don’t want to kick you out of your bed again tonight. <B><I>I</I></B> can sleep on the couch.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, I insist. I end up falling asleep on the couch most nights anyway.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Okay, goodnight Alex.&quot; She turned, a little reluctant to face her dreams.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Danielle if you have a nightmare and need to talk... I’m a light sleeper.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">*****</P>
<P>Alex awoke in the middle of the night. An unfamiliar noise alerted her senses. Someone was in the room. Slowly
her eyes adjusted and she looked about warily.</P>
<P>Danielle lay on the floor beside her, curled up in a blanket.</P>
<P>Alex whispered, not wanting to startle her. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle rolled over to face her. &quot;I’m sorry. Did I wake you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Is everything okay?&quot; Alex asked.</P>
<P>&quot;I had another nightmare. I didn’t mean to wake you... I just wanted to be close to... someone. I’m such
a coward.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are anything but a coward.&quot; Alex reached down to give her a hand up. &quot;Come on, I think we
would both sleep better in bed.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle felt relief wash over her and she looked up gratefully. The unexpected tenderness of Alex’s expression
touched her heart. Their eyes met, and Danielle felt that pleasant flutter again. She glanced away nervously.</P>
<P>Alex noticed her anxiety &quot;You don’t snore, do you?&quot; Alex teased.</P>
<P>&quot;Err, no. At least I don’t think so...&quot; She relaxed a little and decided to play along. &quot;I hope
you aren’t one of those people who steal all the covers.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex started toward the bedroom. &quot;I’ve never had any complaints.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle didn’t doubt that for a minute. She smiled to herself and followed.</P>
<P>They settled in quietly. The memories of her attackers were the furthest thing from Danielle’s mind as she lay
beside the older woman. She felt safe.</P>
<P>&quot;Thanks.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex was on her side facing the door, an ingrained safety precaution. She turned to Danielle, and gently tucked
a stray lock of hair behind the young woman’s ear. &quot;Get some sleep. Everything’s going to be all right.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle knew it was true; she never felt better. She took a deep breath and closed her eyes. In no time she
was fast asleep.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">*****</P>
<P>It was a beautiful sunny day. They rowed across the lake to a favorite spot of Alex’s to have a picnic lunch
that Danielle had spent the morning preparing. After pulling the boat ashore, they hiked into the woods for several
miles. It had been well worth the walk. The view when they broke through the woods into the clearing took Danielle’s
breath away. The sun streamed down giving the area a magical feel.</P>
<P>It was a pleasant afternoon. Danielle spent most of the time chatting non-stop while Alex listened.</P>
<P>She had tried to draw her friend out on a couple of occasions but Alex seemed content to let Danielle monopolize
the conversation. She found the stories about Danielle’s childhood experiences fascinating. Danielle’s youth had
been so different from her own.</P>
<P>Alex began packing up the remnants of their picnic lunch while Danielle sat back enjoying the feel of the refreshing
breeze against her skin. She had never been more content and didn’t want to come down from this natural high. The
time she had spent with Alex the last two days had been wonderful.</P>
<P>She stood and stretched in the warm sunlight, taking in her surroundings with a child-like awe. Catching a glimpse
of color to her right, she walked toward it.</P>
<P>&quot;Wild flowers!&quot;</P>
<P>Alex watched with amusement, as Danielle ran her fingers over the brightly colored petals and took in their
sweet scent. She was amazed how the smallest things gave Danielle pleasure. The young woman saw only the good in
things, approaching life with a naive wonder. It was a fragile quality and Alex found herself wanting to shield
her from anything that would corrupt it.</P>
<P>Danielle sat on a log, reveling in the beauty around her. She was so distracted that she didn’t notice four
fox pups emerge from a burrow near the end of the fallen tree. They ran playfully toward her. She gasped in surprise.</P>
<P>&quot;Alex, look...&quot;</P>
<P>Alex got to her feet and scanned the tree line cautiously, sure the mother was nearby. &quot;Danielle, get up
and back away slowly.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle looked up and smiled. One pup playfully nipped at her shoelace, pulling her attention from Alex. Danielle
laughed and gently ran her fingers through it’s coat. &quot;He’s so soft.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex started to repeat her warning, but it was too late. The vixen broke through the woods and headed toward
Danielle. There was not enough time to position herself between Danielle and the mother. Alex looked around quickly
for something she could use as a weapon. She eyed a good sized rock and bent to pick it up.</P>
<P>Danielle noticed the mother’s approach and looked toward Alex. When her eyes settled on the crude weapon in
Alex’s hand, her stomach lurched. She understood what her friend meant to do.</P>
<P>Alex gauged the distance, taking the weight of the rock into consideration. She watched the vixen anxiously,
her muscles taut, ready to react. If the fox made a move to attack Danielle, she felt fairly confident she could
hit it.</P>
<P>&quot;Wait!&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle slowly stood up. She took a small step backward. But, the pups followed her playfully biting at her
sneakers. The mother was only about twenty feet from Danielle now, weaving back and forth, watching her intently.</P>
<P>Danielle sat down, eyeing the worried mother. She slid her sneakers off and began playing with the pups. The
vixen got within ten feet and stopped. Her attention fully focused on the young woman.</P>
<P>Danielle could not contain a laugh as one aggressive pup pulled the shoe from her grasp and proudly pranced
off to present the prize to its mother. The vixen sniffed the shoe and laid down, cautiously watching the scene.</P>
<P>Alex looked on in disbelief. Three of the pups were frolicking around Danielle and the fourth was snuggled up
against her leg. &quot;Alex.&quot; Danielle waved her arm, encouraging her friend to come closer.</P>
<P>Alex approached slowly, never taking her eyes off the mother. As she neared, the vixen sat up warily. The tall
woman’s body was tense, ready to react. Danielle smiled up at her and reached out, lightly brushing the fingers
that clutched the jagged weapon. The young woman’s touch melted her tension away. Danielle eased the rock from
her grasp and laid it down, replacing it with the warmth of her hand. She gently pulled Alex’s arm, urging her
to sit.</P>
<P>As soon as Alex was at their level, the pups were all over her, sniffing and prodding. Danielle held her hand,
squeezing comfortingly, then she placed it on the pup at her side. &quot;Feel how soft. Aren’t they beautiful?&quot;
The orange pups had black ears and feet. Their bellies were white and their tails were long and bushy. Their eyes
were alert, cat-like.</P>
<P>Alex ran her fingers through the plush fur, acutely aware of the hand that lay over hers. As Danielle’s fingers
stroked the soft fur, her palm caressed the back of Alex’s hand. Alex sunk her fingers into the thick fur and quietly
relished the innocent contact.</P>
<P>Danielle didn’t seem to notice. Her attention was focused on the playful pups. Alex allowed herself the luxury
of extending her gaze at her young friend. She was entranced by the way Danielle’s nose crinkled when she smiled
and her eyes sparkled when she laughed. Alex thought for one moment about lifting the soft fingers to her lips
and quickly closed her eyes.</P>
<P>Suddenly, the energetic pups bounded onto her lap, pushing her backward. Danielle was startled by the soft sounds
coming from her friend. It struck her that it was the first time she had heard Alex laugh. It was magical.</P>
<P>Danielle looked down at the happy woman, normally so stoic and controlled, and her heart swelled. The pups were
having a field day. One had a hold of the laces of Alex’s top, another was licking at her neck, while yet another
was engaged with her in a tug of war for Danielle’s sneaker.</P>
<P>The sun reflected off her dazzling blue eyes and suddenly Danielle was lost in them. Without thought, she moved
her hand to Alex’s face, her fingers lifting the stray strands of dark hair from her moist lips. Their eyes met
and Danielle began to lean down.</P>
<P>There was a sharp bark. Danielle pulled back and Alex sat up quickly. The father was at the edge of the woods
calling. The family quickly ran to him, disappearing into the woods. Danielle’s heart was pounding furiously. She
meant to kiss Alex and had nearly done it.</P>
<P>Alex smiled and looked at her. &quot;That was amazing.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle heart stopped for one instant, then realized they were thinking different things. Alex hadn’t even
noticed her clumsy advance.</P>
<P>Danielle shrugged and tried to recover. &quot;Animals like me.&quot; She winked. &quot;You aren’t the only one
with unusual skills.&quot; She effectively masked her disappointment with humor.</P>
<P>&quot;Apparently not.&quot; Alex grinned.</P>
<P>Danielle glanced at Alex’s dark top sprinkled with red fur. She innocently wiped the hair off, accidentally
brushing Alex’s breast. Suddenly aware of the intimacy of her action she pulled back. &quot;I... err... they got
hair all over you.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex’s nipple hardened from the brief contact. She stood up awkwardly and brushed off her clothes. A torrent
of unfamiliar emotions flooded through her. &quot;Yeah... ah... it’s getting late. We should finish packing up
and go back.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sure, if you want.&quot; Danielle said sadly.</P>
<P>They picked up their things in awkward silence. Danielle was angry with herself for ruining the moment. Had
Alex thought she was making a pass? She hadn’t meant anything by the casual touch, but even as the thought crossed
her mind, she knew her lack of courage had been the only thing to keep her from doing more. Her fingers tingled,
remembering the brief contact. She felt miserable and risked a glance at Alex who seemed to be avoiding eye contact.
Danielle got up to search for her sneakers.</P>
<P>Alex watched Danielle walk away and grimaced. She didn’t think Danielle had noticed her react to her touch but
she wasn’t sure. Alex was confused by the excitement coursing through her body. Her friend's action had been innocent,
she had no doubt about that, but for a split second she had considered pushing the young woman back on the grass
and ...</P>
<P>What was happening to her? She knew she had to get a grip on her emotions. She cared about Danielle far too
much to lead her on when nothing could come of it. The thought saddened her. She looked up to see Danielle return
shoeless and tried to act casual.</P>
<P>&quot;No luck, huh?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nope.&quot; Danielle shrugged. &quot;They were kind of old anyway.&quot; She looked hesitantly in the
direction of the lake. The idea of tromping through the woods in her stocking feet didn’t appeal to her.</P>
<P>Alex hesitated only a moment. &quot;I’ll give you a lift.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle looked at her curiously. Alex smiled. &quot;Come on, I’ll carry you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You... you mean like a piggy back ride?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah, didn’t you ever do that when you were a kid?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sure, it’s just... well I’m quite a bit heavier now. I don’t want to hurt you.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex’s face broke into a playful smile. &quot;I think I can handle the strain.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle couldn’t help but laugh. &quot;All right, you asked for it.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex positioned herself in front of a large rock. &quot;You’ll have to carry the basket. I’ll hold your legs.&quot;
Danielle stepped up and wrapped her free arm around Alex’s neck. Her legs slid easily around the taller woman’s
waist. Firm arms locked around her thighs, securing her in place. They were a perfect fit.</P>
<P>True to her word Alex carried her effortlessly and much sooner than Danielle would have liked, they were back
at the boat. The trip across the lake back to the cabin was a quiet one. Both women had a lot on their minds. The
weekend was over. It was time for Danielle to return home.</P>
