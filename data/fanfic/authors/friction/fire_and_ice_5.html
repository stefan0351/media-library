<!-- Fire and Ice \ Part 5 -->

<P>Alex berated herself for her carelessness. She couldn’t imagine why she hadn’t gotten rid of the scarf and wondered
if subconsciously she had wanted Danielle to find out all along. It had ended their friendship quickly and irrevocably.
Something she did not have the will to do. She deeply regretted the pain she had caused Danielle, but it was out
of her hands now. The important thing was that Danielle was safe. Somehow Alex had to move on.</P>
<P>Never one to indulge in self pity, she tried to convince herself this was for the best and struggled to keep
sorrow from engulfing her. If she focused on what she had lost, the pain would paralyze her. She had to plan her
next move. She couldn’t afford to get sloppy. Her mother and brother would be in danger if she were arrested.</P>
<P>It was time to leave town. Her heart grew heavy as she thought of the numerous times had she packed up her few
belongings and moved on. For the first time it felt like she was leaving home. Her pain deepened as she realized
that Danielle was the reason for that.</P>
<P>Walking through the cabin, gathering up her scant possessions, proved to be tortuous. There were memories of
Danielle everywhere. Her eyes fell on the champagne cork on the stand beside the bed. She flashed back to the surprised
expression on Danielle face when the champagne had sprayed her. The memory of Danielle tore at her heart. Alex
carefully set the cork down and hastily left the room.</P>
<P>She was almost out the door when her cell phone rang, startling her out of her thoughts. She hesitated answering
it, then relented.</P>
<P>&quot;Alex?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Julian.&quot; She expelled a frustrated sigh. This was the last thing she needed.</P>
<P>&quot;My sources tell me your in New York. I have a job for you to do.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I was leaving today. Things are beginning to unravel here.&quot; She forced the emotion she felt from
her voice.</P>
<P>&quot;I’m sure you can handle it. What difference will a few days make?&quot; She grimaced. The idea of remaining
at the cabin with her memories was unbearable.</P>
<P>&quot;What do you want?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A van Gogh from the MET.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Alex laughed sarcastically. &quot;Oh... is that all.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You can consider it a personal favor.&quot; There was a hint of urgency in his voice.</P>
<P>Alex listened intently, wondering if she might at last have an out.</P>
<P>&quot;It’s not like I’m asking you to break into Fort Knox. This shouldn’t be much of a problem for you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Easy for you to say,&quot;</P>
<P>He laughed. &quot;Alex, you’re so resourceful. I’m sure you won’t let me down. I’ll contact you in a few days.&quot;</P>
<P>Unable to leave town and unwilling to return to the cabin, Alex set up camp in the surrounding woods. When her
life was bleakest she found solace in the forest. The quiet darkness and star filled sky were usually a comfort
to her, but not tonight. She was miserable. She sat by the fire staring at Danielle’s journal. She couldn’t summon
the will to read it. Yet she found a curious comfort in holding it close.</P>
<P>If only she hadn’t gotten involved in Danielle’s life. But she had, and Danielle was suffering because of it.
Had the young woman been serious about her journal being of no use to her? Did she mean she wouldn’t write anymore?
Alex pushed the thought from her mind. It was too painful. She ran her hands over the spiral design and summoned
the courage to open it. Nervously she flipped to the last entry.</P>

<ul>
	<ul>
		<P>In my mind, there is but one certainty. I want Alex: in my heart, in my life and in my bed. My attraction for
		her is utterly compelling. The desire I feel for her is overpowering. I long for her touch. I want to feel the
		heat of her skin beneath my fingers. I can’t stop thinking of what it would be like to feel her body pressed to
		mine. I want to climb inside her, feel her arms around me. The thought that it might never be, leaves me aching,
		hungry. Traces of her scent linger in my mind. I dread the time we are apart. At last I know desire and my misery
		is exquisite.</P>
		<P>When I can’t be with her, the night is my solace. In sleep I have Alex. My unconsciousness thoughts are more
		than fantasies. They have the feel of recollections, something between a dream and a memory. Her arms have never
		held me like a lover. Her lips have never kissed mine and yet I hunger for the sensations they would elicit. When
		we are together my eyes refuse to leave her. And when our eyes meet, even fleetingly, it is electric. I know those
		eyes. But only in my dreams do I see the need in them, their hunger for me.</P>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<P>Alex closed her eyes, her soul blanketed in a sorrow from which there was no escape.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">*****</P>
<P>The drive to the cabin seemed endless. Faced with the prospect of never seeing Alex again, the memories she
had of their time together made her heart ache. Yet her mind refused to discard the vivid images. As painful as
they were, they seemed essential to her very being.</P>
<P>It was inconceivable that only hours ago her life had been filled with promise and now things were desperately
bleak. Danielle feared Alex was already gone. The thought that she might never see her again was terrifying. She
prayed for a second chance, one more opportunity to speak with her.</P>
<P>Danielle’s heart sank as she pulled into the driveway. Alex’s car was gone. The cabin was dark. She tried the
door. It was locked. She slipped her hand deep into the sleeve of Alex’s leather jacket and broke the glass on
the door. Reaching inside, she unlocked it and entered. The sight of the familiar room filled her with longing.
She went to the bedroom. The closet doors were open and Alex’s clothes were gone.</P>
<P>Suddenly weak, she sat on the bed. She had never felt so alone in her life. She was ready to walk out of the
room when something on the bedside table caught her eye. She picked up the champagne cork and rolled it in her
hand, gently she closed her fingers around it. &quot;Where are you Alex?&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">*****</P>
<P>Danielle walked out on the porch and looked out over the water. If Alex didn’t want to be found it was unlikely
that she would ever see her again. She walked toward the lake unsure of what to do next. The moon light sparkled
off the surface of the water, but Danielle never noticed the beauty before her. She walked along the shore lost
in her thoughts.</P>
<P>The medallion around her neck seemed to pulse against her skin, bringing her out of her contemplation. As she
ran her fingers over the spiraled surface, her pain became more acute and her eyes filled with tears. When she
tilted her head back to wipe them away, a flicker of light in the distant woods caught her attention. Mindlessly,
she headed toward it. As she neared, she saw it was a campfire. Her heart began to race as she moved quietly toward
it. She was about twenty feet away when she saw her, bathed in the glow of the fire’s light, her head bowed down
solemnly. Danielle came forward slowly. Her approach was nearly silent but Alex felt her presence long before she
heard her. She turned to face Danielle. Her face mirrored the anguish she felt.</P>
<P>Even in the dim light Danielle could see her pain, She had never seen Alex so vulnerable. Danielle stilled,
afraid her friend might bolt. Alex turned back to the fire, struggling to compose herself.</P>
<P>&quot;Alex I need to talk to you...&quot;</P>
<P>She kept her back to Danielle, knowing her face would betray her and reveal too much.</P>
<P>&quot;Please, you owe me that much.&quot; Danielle watched Alex’s shoulders stiffen at her words.</P>
<P>Alex did not respond. It was all she could do to keep her body from shaking.</P>
<P>&quot;Did you read my journal?&quot;</P>
<P>Alex looked deep into the fire, as if to draw strength from it. She nodded. &quot;I’m so sorry. I never meant
to hurt you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Were you going to leave without saying good-bye?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I thought you'd call the police&quot; She swallowed her pain. &quot;You should have.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex’s words hurt. &quot;I would never... What reason have I given you not to trust me? I… I lied to protect
you. You... read my journal. You know everything... and I know nothing.&quot; Tears slid down her cheeks.</P>
<P>Alex lower her head in shame. &quot;I don’t deserve your trust.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You saved my life. You... touched my heart. If you care even a little... you’ll stay, give me time to
understand... time to talk.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I... Danielle please... you should leave.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, damn it! Tell me what you're thinking! Don't shut me out.&quot; Danielle was frustrated, desperate.</P>
<P>&quot;I can’t... I’m sorry... Please believe me... you’ll be better off without me.&quot; Her voice was shaky
but resolved, for once in her life she intended to do what was right.</P>
<P>Danielle closed the distance between them and grabbed her wrist, pulling the taller woman around to face her.
&quot;I’m not leaving until you talk to me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Please... let this go.&quot; Alex felt the skin of her wrist tingle from the young woman’s touch. She
avoided the hypnotic green eyes that sought her out, fearing she would lose what little control remained.</P>
<P>&quot;No, you mean too much to me! I have to know the truth. I have to know how you feel.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex met her gaze for the first time, reaching deep inside for the strength to do what she knew was right. &quot;It
doesn’t matter how I feel, I’ve done things... things you can’t begin to imagine. I’ve made enemies. People who
would get pleasure from hurting you. We can’t be together. I’ve been fooling myself. I can’t put you in that kind
of danger.&quot; Her voice was firm, final.</P>
<P>Danielle released her wrist and looked down sadly. &quot;I’m never going to see you again, am I?&quot;</P>
<P>Alex felt the young woman’s despair. The last thing she wanted was to cause her more pain. Her hand reached
out to comfort her. &quot;I’m sorry. It’s best this way.&quot; Her fingertips lightly brushed the smaller woman’s
arm.</P>
<P>The casual touch ignited a spark inside Danielle. Her body responded instantly and she knew she could not give
Alex up without a fight. There had to be a way to convince her.</P>
<P>&quot;Your leaving is <B>not</B> best for me!&quot; Danielle clenched her hands in frustration. &quot;You don’t
know what you’re throwing away, for both of us. I can’t let you give up on us.&quot;</P>
<P>The young woman’s words hurt so much that Alex didn’t think she could endure it. She took a shaky step back.</P>
<P>&quot;You don’t understand. I have a darkness in me that...&quot; She paused knowing it was impossible for Danielle
to comprehend the extent of her sins. &quot;I’m no better than the monster that tried to rape you. I’ve done so
many things I...&quot; Her voice cracked with emotion. &quot;You have to forget me.&quot; She looked at her helplessly.</P>
<P>The pain Danielle saw broke her heart. She met Alex’s eyes. &quot;There is good in you, so much. I see it. I
feel it.&quot; Her voice was gentle, but resolute. &quot;We’re meant to be together. I don’t understand it, but
I know in my heart it’s true and I think you do, too.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle slipped the medallion from her neck. &quot;Alex, this isn’t a medallion. It’s a locket. It opens.&quot;
She placed it in the woman’s palm and gently curled Alex’s finger’s around it.</P>
<P>&quot;Think about leaving me for my own good. Think about a life without me.&quot; Alex’s eyes welled with tears.
She opened her hand quickly, startled by the medallion’s change in temperature. She looked at the young woman,
puzzled.</P>
<P>Danielle’s took Alex’s hand in her own and pressed her fingers closed on the medallion. She held Alex’s fist
in both of her hands. &quot;Now, think of the time we’ve spent together, the moments we shared. The time at the
lake.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex inhaled as she felt an energy build within her, surging down her arm until it passed through her skin into
Danielle. For an instant they were one, it was electric. Danielle released Alex’s hand and stepped back, breathless.
Alex stood motionless, trying to understand what had happened.</P>
<P>&quot;Open your hand.&quot; Danielle watched as Alex raised her hand, the medallion in her outstretched palm.
It popped open. Alex held it up in the firelight.</P>
<P>&quot;That’s my grandmother. And I’m willing to bet the other woman is your ancestor. The resemblance is amazing.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex’s hand trembled as she gave the locket back to her. She knew she had experienced something miraculous,
but it didn’t change her situation or the danger she posed to Danielle.</P>
<P>&quot;Danielle, I can’t gamble with your life. I won’t.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Tell me you don’t feel anything for me and I’ll leave.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex looked away, summoning the courage to lie.</P>
<P>Before she could begin, Danielle interrupted her. &quot;Alex, please don’t do this.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I’m sorry ... I can’t. My past would haunt us, destroy any chance we might have of a life together.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This is the biggest mistake of your life. Please give us more time!&quot;</P>
<P>Alex looked away and stepped back, putting more space between them.</P>
<P>Danielle watched her retreat sadly. &quot;There’s nothing I can say to change your mind?&quot;</P>
<P>Alex shook her head.</P>
<P>Danielle inhaled deeply. She had never known such despair. &quot;That’s it then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes...&quot; Alex responded weakly.</P>
<P>Tears overflowed Danielle’s eyes and she turned to walk away. The medallion tingled in her grasp. She stopped
and turned to face Alex. It was now or never. She could not leave without expressing what was in her heart. Danielle
took a deep breath.</P>
<P>&quot;Alex, I... I love you. You touched something deep inside me. From the first moment I saw you, I knew you
were the only one for me.&quot; Alex remained silent.</P>
<P>&quot;God I wish you could tell me how you feel. I know you care. I’ve seen it in your eyes... felt it in your
touch.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Danielle, I’m sorry...I don’t... feel...&quot; She quickly averted her eyes, unable to finish the lie.</P>
<P>&quot;You don’t feel what... The same? I don’t believe you. Why were you following me the night I was attacked?
Why did you return my journal and the medallion? Why have you stayed?&quot; Danielle tired to make eye contact.
&quot;Alex, why did you save the champagne cork?&quot;</P>
<P>She braced herself for Alex’s denial. When it didn’t come she continued. &quot;Can you live the rest of your
life wondering what we might have shared? I can’t.&quot; She took a nervous breath. &quot;I… I’m drawn to you.
I have nearly driven myself crazy with fantasies of what it would be like to share my life with you... to be with
you.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle glanced away shyly. &quot;I... I never felt desire until I met you... I can’t live my life not knowing
the feel your lips on mine. I... I want you to....&quot;</P>
<P>She raised her eyes slowly to meet Alex’s. &quot;I need you to kiss me.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle’s heart hammered desperately, fearing both rejection and acceptance. &quot;Please, one kiss and if
you still want me to, I’ll leave... let you go.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex took a step toward Danielle. Her heart ached as she viewed the anguish and longing in the young woman’s
eyes. She wanted to take Danielle in her arms. Her need was so intense it seemed a physical pain. She reached her
hand tentatively toward Danielle’s face. Her fingers lightly brushing the young woman’s trembling lips. Alex could
not suppress the urgency pulsing through her. She wanted Danielle, desperately.</P>
<P>Danielle placed her right hand behind Alex’s neck and sunk the fingers into the dark silky hair. Alex’s body
reacted before her mind could object. Her head bent forward, her lips only inches from the woman before her. Slowly,
Danielle pulled her in. When their lips touched, Danielle moaned, her entire being tingled with sensation. Her
mind and body reeled. Suspended out of time and space, there was only she and Alex.</P>
<P>She pressed into the kiss and shivered as Alex’s tongue slipped past her lips. She felt Alex tremble as her
body succumbed to her need. The powerful woman melted in her arms, all resistance gone. The moment was electric.</P>
<P>Alex’s strong hands gripped Danielle’s waist, pulling her in. Their bodies pressed together in a fevered union.
The heat was searing, their kiss endless.</P>
<P>Danielle’s body came alive. She ground her hips sensually against Alex. The dark-haired woman moaned and broke
the kiss, her eyes searching Danielle’s. The love and need she saw there were dizzying. She closed her eyes, struggling
to regain control. Her body thrummed with desire, making rational thought impossible. She didn’t have the will
to fight it. Nothing in her life had ever felt so right.</P>
<P>Danielle whispered breathlessly. &quot;Don’t stop, please... let it happen.&quot; Her eyes pleaded, but Alex
never saw the urgency there. She was focused on Danielle’s full lips. She had tasted their sweetness, and she was
lost. Alex swept the young woman up in her arms and carried her to the fire, laying her gently on her sleeping
bag. She knelt beside her.</P>
<P>A primal need reflected in Alex’s eyes as she stared hungrily at the woman before her. Her feelings spilled
from her in a heartfelt confession, her voice hoarse with passion. &quot;Forgive me... I want you so much.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle didn’t hesitate, she took advantage of Alex’s weakness and pulled her down, rolling on top of her.
She bent down, her tongue seeking the sweet taste of Alex’s mouth. Her thirst was insistent, driven by years of
yearning. Every nerve in her body tingled. The thought that Alex might falter and pull back made her advances even
more fervent. She had to have her, there was no turning back. &quot;Alex I need you... I need you so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes... Oh yes.&quot;</P>
<P>Her words caused Danielle’s passion to shift from a slow burn to a blaze that was totally consuming. Their lips
met again and her body trembled with the contact. Danielle’s heart felt like it would explode. All thought was
gone. She was driven by instinct alone, euphoric as her body pressed against the length of Alex, claiming what
she so desperately desired. She moaned and drank in her heat.</P>
<P>Slowly she pulled back, straddling Alex. Her face flush with excitement. Her lightweight skirt was pushed up
tightly around her hips. Her breathing was heavy, fevered. A thin covering of moisture shone on her skin in her
body’s futile attempt to cool itself. She looked to Alex for the release only she could provide.</P>
<P>When their eyes met, Alex thought she might die for want of this woman. She reached up and slowly unbuttoned
Danielle’s shirt, sliding it off her shoulders. The sight of the young woman’s breasts took her breath away. Her
erect nipples strained forward, begging for attention.</P>
<P>Her hands roamed up Danielle’s sides. She wanted to run her tongue over the eager flesh, to take each tenderly
in her mouth. It was impossible to hold back. Her fingertips gripped the soft skin as her thumbs grazed the tip
of each breast.</P>
<P>&quot;Ohhh yes.&quot; Danielle moaned and her head fell back.</P>
<P>Alex pulled her down, capturing the young woman’s mouth. The sweet taste of her was indescribable. She could
not get enough. Effortlessly Alex rolled her over, gaining the top position. She sat back on her heels, breathless.
Kneeling between Danielle’s legs, she unfastened her skirt, tossing it aside.</P>
<P>Danielle reached up to unbutton Alex’s top. Her fingers trembled with anticipation, making the task difficult.
Desperately, she grabbed the edges of the material and forced them apart, releasing a shower of buttons.</P>
<P>Alex gasped in surprise. Danielle smiled, pleased by her reaction. The passion Alex saw in her young lover’s
eyes inflamed her. She claimed Danielle’s mouth once more, groaning as their bare breasts touched. Her hands grasped
Danielle’s bottom, kneading the pliant flesh. She pulled her onto her lap.</P>
<P>Danielle wrapped her legs around Alex’s waist, causing her to emit a low passionate groan. Alex had never felt
such softness. Their bodies melded as if they were each part of the same being.</P>
<P>Danielle greedily captured her mouth. Alex breathlessly relented as her lover’s inquisitive tongue pressed past
her lips, exploring her with the ardor of a first love.</P>
<P>Throughout their kiss, Danielle pressed her sex firmly against Alex. The sensation of the wet cotton panties
against her belly inflamed her. She slid a finger past the elastic waistband, desperate to rid Danielle of the
garment without breaking the delicious contact.. She pulled back and looked into her lover’s eyes while tugging
gently at the thin material that separated her from what she needed more than air.</P>
<P>&quot;Pleeease... do it!&quot; Danielle’s voice was hoarse, her eyes glazed with passion.</P>
<P>Alex recaptured her mouth and with two quick rips removed the unwanted clothing. With the last barrier gone,
she felt Danielle’s naked sex press against her and released a shuddering sigh. Danielle immediately spread her
legs wider, increasing their contact. Alex moaned as she felt the evidence of Danielle’s desire, wet and slippery,
coat her skin. She pressed the young woman to her. Nearly lost in the rapture, she wanted to taste her, to thrust
into her. Her fingers gently grasped the young woman’s bottom and slowly lifted and lowered her in a sensual rhythm.
The heat of Danielle’s slick center gliding over her taut abdomen was delicious. Alex lightly caressed her lover’s
earlobe with her lips, then softly nipped her neck, breathing hotly against her skin.</P>
<P>Danielle was delirious with pleasure. The sensation of her swollen clit rubbing against Alex’s hot flesh caused
her to moan unrestrained. The contact was intense, unrelenting. It was ecstasy. She felt an exquisite tension coiling
inside her and knew instinctively that the rapture that she had yearned for her entire life was almost upon her.
She was nearing orgasm, and she wanted it, more than she had ever wanted anything.</P>
<P>Her head fell back as she clung to the strong woman’s shoulders. &quot;Ohhh... Alex... &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let go, I’ve got you.&quot; Alex whispered softly.</P>
<P>Instantly it was upon her. Danielle’s body went rigid and she cried out, gripping her lover’s shoulders as spasm
after spasm tore through her. Her body quivered as glorious sensations spiraled outward from her center. It seemed
to go on and on as Alex maintained the steady rhythm, prolonging her pleasure.</P>
<P>Danielle took a long trembling breath and collapsed against her lover, her head cradled in the hollow of the
older woman’s shoulder. Nothing had prepared the young woman for the magnitude of her release. When her senses
slowly returned, the raw intensity of her emotions overwhelmed her and she cried in her lover’s embrace. Alex pulled
the sleeping bag around them and held Danielle lovingly in her arms, rocking her gently.</P>
<P>Soon, Danielle calmed and looked deeply into her eyes. &quot;Alex, I remember you. My body remembers you.&quot;</P>
<P>She softly kissed Alex’s face, her lips lightly brushing her brows. She tenderly stroked her dark hair, afraid
this was some wonderful dream that she would awaken from. Her fingers gently trace the fine features of Alex’s
face in an attempt to verify she was real.</P>
<P>Danielle searched Alex’s eyes for a sign that her love was returned. The adoration she in her lover’s eyes made
her fears disappear.</P>
<P>&quot;I’ve never been so happy. Please... give us a chance.&quot;</P>
<P>Tears rolled down Alex’s cheeks as she hugged Danielle. She tried to imagine how she could go on without this
woman in her life. Her carefully constructed walls were crumbling. Like it or not, her heart had opened to this
remarkable young woman. She realized that regardless of her decision, she owed Danielle the truth about her feelings.</P>
<P>She pulled Danielle tightly to her and whispered. &quot;No matter what happens... know that I love you... more
than life.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex’s words filled Danielle with joy, renewing her conviction. She would find a way to make Alex understand
that they were stronger together than apart. She looked deep into her eyes, trying to express feelings there were
no words for.</P>
<P>The sky opened, releasing a light rain. Alex tipped her head back and let the cool water splash her face. Danielle
watched entranced, as water droplets sparkled on her lover’s lashes. The woman before her was truly magnificent...
and hers. Her mouth hungrily claimed Alex’s and their passion flared, mindless of the persistent rain.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">*****</P>
<P>Back at the cabin, the two women sat naked in front of the fireplace holding hands. They stared into the glowing
flames. Both needed to maintain physical contact, a link between them. Unfamiliar emotions left Alex confused and
vulnerable, for the first time in her life she was truly afraid.</P>
<P>Danielle looked dreamily into the fire. She was caught in the wake of physical pleasure of an intensity she
had never imagined. She didn’t want it to end. Her body had felt nothing for so long, that now she allowed herself
to reveal in the incredible sensations she had experienced. Alex loved her. There was nothing she could not face.
Danielle would not back down. She had to have Alex in her life.</P>
<P>Finally, she drew in a long breath and summoned the courage to speak, praying she would be able to convince
Alex of the miracle that she now wholeheartedly embraced: they were destined to be together.</P>
<P>&quot;I want to express what you mean to me, but I don’t have words to communicate the love I feel. I need to
be with you.&quot; She took Alex’s hand and press the long fingers to her lips.</P>
<P>&quot;My entire life, I knew that something vital to my being was missing. At last I have found you. I feel
whole.&quot; She paused and looked intently in her lover’s eyes. Finding only love there, she continued. &quot;Can’t
you feel it?&quot;</P>
<P>Alex did, but couldn’t reply. Her throat was tight with emotion. Her feelings were consuming her. It was too
much. She gently squeezed Danielle’s hand.</P>
<P>Danielle squeezed back comfortingly. &quot;Alex I know I told you I would leave if that’s what you decided,
but I... I don’t think I can. There’s no going back for me. I am so sure of us. I am willing to risk anything to
be with you. <B>Anything</B>... Please don’t send me away. I’m asking you to trust in our love.&quot;</P>
<P>She held Alex’s face in her hands, desperate for her lover to understand.</P>
<P>A single tear slid down Alex’s cheek. She rose and stood before the fire, staring into the hypnotic flames.
The thought of something happening to Danielle terrified her. The young woman’s safety was her main concern. Still,
she couldn’t dismiss the miracle of Danielle’s love. She had no doubt that they were meant to be together. There
was no denying that for some inexplicable reason their destinies were intertwined. She needed Danielle and believed
in her heart that Danielle needed her. There were no easy solutions.</P>
<P>She felt the warmth of Danielle’s hand as it slid into her own and a calm enveloped her. The tension drained
from her body. She sat down and parted her legs, gently seating Danielle between them. Alex eased her lover back
against her bare chest, solving her need for contact, without revealing the emotions she was struggling with. She
wrapped her arms tenderly around Danielle and gently rocked her back and forth, unsure if her actions were meant
to comfort herself or her young lover. Danielle remained silent, relishing their closeness. She waited patiently,
allowing Alex the time she needed.</P>
<P>Slowly Alex came to her decision. Closing her eyes, she allowed herself to feel the soothing presence of the
young woman’s sitting between her bent legs. The warmth of Danielle hips against her inner thighs, the softness
of her hair against her breasts was heavenly. She was keenly aware of the heat that radiated from her body at each
place their skin made contact. It amazed her how in such a very short time Danielle had come to mean everything
to her.</P>
<P>She took a deep breath and whispered softly into her lover’s ear. &quot;Together then... for better or worse,
we’ll go through this together.&quot; Danielle’s heart leapt. She tilted her face up and eased back against her
lover’s soft breasts.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh...Alex....&quot;</P>
<P>Alex bent to capture the eager lips of her young lover. Her kiss sent streams of tingling pleasure to Danielle’s
core. A warm flush radiated through her body and she became acutely aware of Alex’s erect nipples pressing against
her back. She wanted to turn to face Alex but her body refused to break the warm embrace.</P>
<P>She struggled to speak. &quot;Alex I want you, I want to make love to you. Show me how to please you.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex smiled and breathed hotly into her lover’s ear. &quot;Mmmm... yes, I’ll show you. We’ll practice... on
you.&quot; The deep tone of Alex’s voice made Danielle’s pulse quicken, her body instantly responding to the idea.</P>
<P>&quot;I’ll go very slowly, so you’ll remember every kiss... every touch.&quot; She felt her young lover’s body
tremble. Danielle moaned, her passion heightened by her lover’s words. Her head lolled back and rested on her partner’s
strong shoulder. Alex’s fingers moved across Danielle’s torso with feathery light caresses. The teasing contact
was delicious. Alex cupped her lover’s breasts in her hands. Her thumbs circled Danielle’s erect nipples.</P>
<P>&quot;I love the way your body responds to me.&quot; She whispered sensually.</P>
<P>The warmth of her lover’s breath and heat of her words eroded the last of Danielle’s inhibitions. All traces
of the reserved woman she had once been were gone. Unabashed, she arched into her lover’s touch.</P>
<P>Alex’s thumbs brushed the harden tips of her lover’s breasts, flicking the sensitive points. Danielle moaned
as she felt moisture trickle from her opening. Encouraged by her lover’s reaction, Alex rolled the aching nipples
between thumb and forefinger, pulling gently. Danielle groaned with pleasure. Alex’s left hand continued to caress
her lover’s breasts while her right hand ventured lower. Her fingers at last reaching their destination, slowly
sliding through the curly golden hair and across the moist outer lips. Danielle could not contain her excitement.
She cried out.</P>
<P>&quot;Do you need me to stop?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;God no... please.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex smiled, pleased at the urgency in her voice. She used two fingers to spread her lover’s lips and glided
through the ample wetness, the inside of her fingers lightly stroking either side of the young woman’s clitoris.
Danielle felt herself climbing quickly. She was very close.</P>
<P>&quot;Mmm, you’re so swollen, so ready.&quot; Alex smiled. &quot;Do you now how desirable I find you, how much
you please me?&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle’s breathing quickened.</P>
<P>&quot;You’re capable of such pleasure. This beautiful body was just waiting for me, for my touch.&quot; Alex
purred.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes... oh God I... I...&quot; Danielle exclaimed. Her heart pounded as her body flooded with excitement.</P>
<P>&quot;You’re almost there again, aren’t you?&quot; She stopped the motion of her fingers and felt her lover’s
hips thrust toward them in an attempt to resume contact.</P>
<P>&quot;Ohhh Alex... pleeease... &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh no... not so quickly this time. You can sustain arousal for a long time. A very long time.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle trembled. It was such exquisite torture. Her body writhed against Alex, begging for her touch. She
wanted more.</P>
<P>Alex redirected Danielle’s attention by lightly squeezing her nipple. At the same time, she ran the other hand
along the inside of Danielle’s thigh. &quot;I’m going to enter you very slowly. Are you ready?&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle couldn’t form words, she nodded vigorously.</P>
<P>Alex poised one finger at the young woman’s entrance and slid into her teasingly slow. She delighted as Danielle’s
muscles tightened around her, pulling her deeper, until at last she was all the way in. She remained motionless
allowing the young woman’s body to become acutely aware of her presence. Alex reveled in the warmth and softness
surrounding her. It was heavenly.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, Alex.. I feel you ... so deep...&quot; It was utter bliss for Danielle. Her emotions were raw. She
felt so much. Alex sensed her surge of emotion and began to ease her finger out.</P>
<P>&quot;Please...&quot; Danielle grabbed her wrist, holding her firmly in place. &quot;I... I feel you... your
energy inside me. It’s... oh God. Pleeease... I need you.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex kissed her tenderly, then began a slow rhythmic thrusting, pushing deep inside then retreating to the edge
of her entrance. She took her time, allowing the sensations to build inside the young woman. Danielle was climbing
higher and higher, delirious with pleasure. Climax was nearly upon her, the steady pumping driving her wild. Poised
at the brink of release, she held her breath. It was divine.</P>
<P>Then, without warning, Alex slowly extracted her finger. Danielle groaned, her inner muscles clutching at emptiness.
The loss made her ache. Alex adjusted her position moving out from behind the young woman and lowered her to the
floor, careful not to sever physical contact. The young woman’s eyes locked with hers, desperate for an outlet
for her mounting passion. She needed more and kissed Alex hungrily to express it.</P>
<P>Her tongue sought entrance to Alex’s mouth and the stronger woman relented, thrilled by the intensity of her
lover’s desire. The kiss was more forceful and demanding than Alex had expected from the gentle woman, but she
loved it and submitted completely to the aggressive exploration. Soon both women were lost in the heat of the kiss,
equally matched in their passion.</P>
<P>Gradually their frenzied efforts eased. When Alex felt Danielle’s body relax, she began to slowly rekindle the
urgency. She lightly stroked her erect nipples, gently brushing her nails across the hardened nubs. Danielle’s
head fell back, and Alex gently pressed her knee between her lover’s legs, reminding her of her need.</P>
<P>Danielle moaned and arched into her partner’s thigh. Alex teased, pulling back. She positioned her firm leg
inches above Danielle pulsing sex, forcing the desperate young woman to lift into her again and again, for but
the briefest contact, each touch leaving her wanting. Danielle’s eyes were closed tight, fully concentrated on
her effort. Her body unable to remain still.</P>
<P>Alex looked down at Danielle’s tense expression and longed to see the desire cloaked by long lashes and silky
lids. Slowly she lowered her leg, pressing firmly against her lover’s wet center. Danielle’s eyes opened, and Alex
found herself looking into the depths of the young woman’s being. A soul that sought its twin.</P>
<P>Alex’s breath caught. The playfulness in her blue eyes, replaced by luminescent desire. Danielle’s heart hammered
and she opened her mouth to beg her lover to continue. But, the words evaporated as she watched Alex’s head dip
down and felt warm, wet lips closed on her nipple. Alex’s teeth grazed the sensitive erection, pulling while her
tongue licked the aching tip. Danielle moaned softly, and Alex began to suckle, with gentle but unrelenting pressure.
Danielle squirmed under the tender assault, her mind adrift, swimming with pleasure. She was floating, lost in
the sweet sensations.</P>
<P>Without warning, Alex entered her with two fingers, sliding deep inside. Danielle gasped. Alex caressed her
tight walls, heightening her awareness, awakening every fiber of her being. Her suckling became more insistent.
With each deep thrust, her mouth drew hard on the nipple, pulling sensations through the Danielle’s body like an
electric charge. Their combined energy was building inside her, intensifying with each thrust, every pull. It was
too much, and not enough.</P>
<P>Danielle was straining, desperate for even the slightest pressure on her clit. Her hands clenched at her sides,
entangled in the fluffy comforter. The temptation to use them was great, but she held back . Even at the height
of her torment, she understood the perfection in her lover’s attentions and wanted experience their full impact.
Just one touch, and she would merge with this incredible woman, body and soul.</P>
<P>As if reading her mind, Alex circled the swollen nub with her thumb. It was divine torture. Danielle wanted
desperately to shift her hips, force the contact. Her teeth clenched to keep from crying out, and she struggled
to keep still. At last, her lips parted and she exhaled in a long groan. She could not hold back.</P>
<P>Alex felt Danielle’s hips lift, her will broken, and let her thumb slowly glide over the swollen pulsing surface.
That single stroke was all it took. The orgasm was upon her like a tidal wave. Danielle was helpless, plummeting
over the edge. She cried out as currents of ecstasy raced through her, exploding in brilliant colors. She knew
at once that the beautiful light that engulfed her was Alex.</P>
<P>As Danielle slept, Alex tried to imagine what she had done to deserve such a love. She would move heaven and
earth to protect this woman. From this moment on, she would try be the person Danielle deserved.</P>
<P>To do that she had to free herself and that meant at least one more person had to die. And somehow she had to
keep Danielle from being tainted by it.</P>
<P>Alex eventually drifted to sleep and dreamed of the beautiful woman she held in her arms.</P>
