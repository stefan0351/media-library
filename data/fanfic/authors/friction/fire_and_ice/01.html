<P>The figure scaled the wall effortlessly, dropping silently on the other side. A small hand-held electronic device
took out the globe illuminating the rear entrance with a soft pop<I>.</I> In minutes the security alarm was disabled
and the intruder was inside, moving seamlessly though the shadows of the mansion.</P>
<P>The safe was not a problem. It was a clean job. Things were going according to schedule. The dark figure moved
slowly toward the exit. The narrow beam of the flashlight scanned the open door halfway down the hall. It was a
small den. A quick glance revealed nothing of interest and the intruder started to turn away, when something on
the floor glimmered in the soft light.</P>
<P>The thief bent to examine it. The gloved hand gently fingered the object. It was a writing nib, the tip of an
old fashion fountain pen. The intruder paused momentarily and set it on the desk. Beside it lay a leather bound
book. It was old, unique, covered with intriguing symbols. With little hesitation, the thief deposited the book
in the bag of stolen goods and exited the room, continuing down the hall. But the brief stop proved costly. Soft
footfalls warned of someone’s approach.</P>
<P>The intruder ducked into the closest doorway, a bedroom, and listened intently. Someone was steadily approaching.
The thief pressed against the wall behind the door and firmly gripped the handle of the razor sharp knife. A woman
entered and set a plate of food on the table by the bed. The intruder edged forward, preparing to take her out.
Unexpectedly the woman changed direction, walking to the adjoining bathroom. The thief slipped back into the shadows
and watched as the woman closed the bathroom door behind her.</P>
<P>The dark figure waited a beat and slowly came out of hiding, moving cautiously to exit. Suddenly, the bathroom
door opened. The woman was framed in the doorway against a backdrop of light, her golden hair now clearly visible.
The thief froze, mesmerized. Although the reappearance of the woman presented a problem, it wasn’t concern that
the thief felt, but wonder. The blonde was strikingly beautiful, almost ethereal in the pale light.</P>
<P>The intruder’s trance was broken when the young woman shut of the light, shrouding the room once again in darkness.
The thief leaned against the wall, motionless, hoping to escape notice. It seemed that the woman would walk past,
but at the last moment she stopped as if sensing a presence. Just as she was about to turn and face the intruder,
the thief clasped a hand over her mouth and pressed the cold blade to her throat.</P>
<P>Startled, Danielle gasped. Her heart pounded wildly as adrenaline rushed through her veins. She tried to move
but the thief’s hold was firm, the strength of the arms daunting. She was powerless. Danielle tried desperately
not to panic as she was pushed forward, toward the dressing table. The blade tightened against her neck as the
assailant released her mouth and reached for something on the dresser. She inhaled, about to cry out when she felt
the cool silk of her own scarf pressed to her mouth. Purposeful fingers parted her lips and pushed against her
teeth. A sense of dread flowed through her as she realized what was to be done. The blade pressed insistently at
her throat. Her resistance withered and her jaw went slack. She tried desperately not to gag as the scarf was pushed
into her mouth.</P>
<P>Before she had time to think about her situation, she was turned and pressed back against the dressing table
chair. Her eyes instinctively sought out the intruder’s face, hidden by a black ski mask. The dark form of her
attacker melded with the blackness of the room, making it difficult to get a clear view. The coolness of wide blade
burned against her skin, forcing her attention to return to the knife at her throat.</P>
<P>All at once, Danielle’s terror was doubled as she watched the gloved hand reach for the tie at the front of
her robe. She froze, holding her breath as the tie was unfastened and pulled from the loops of her robe. The sensation
of it gliding slowly across her hips made her shiver in dread. Her flimsy robe hung open, revealing her nakedness.
A fear induced sweat coated her body, causing the cool air to sting her exposed skin. She was utterly vulnerable.</P>
<P>A shuddered passed through her as the gloved hand reached for the opening. She held her breath. Her heart beat
wildly as she watched agile fingers grasp the edge of the thin material of her robe, lightly brushing her abdomen.
Danielle closed her eyes, preparing for the worst. She would have begged for her assailant to stop, but the gag
prevented all but a guttural moan.</P>
<P>Before she had a chance to react further, the robe was pulled tightly closed around her. Her eyes sprang open
in surprise. Startled by the small act of kindness, she risked a glance at her captor. The gentleness she saw in
the brown eyes deepened her confusion.</P>
<P>The intruder quickly put the belt to use, tying her hands behind her back. With firm pressure, she was guided
to sit and the belt was secured to the chair. The loose end bound her feet.</P>
<P>Danielle’s mouth and throat were dry, scratchy. She tried to swallow, but the scarf made her cough, causing
the silky material to shift in her mouth. She gagged and inhaled deeply. The forceful intake of breath drew the
scarf to the back of her throat, blocking her windpipe. Her eyes watered and her chest heaved as she fought for
air. She struggled desperately against her restraints. Just as panic overtook her, she felt the gentle touch of
cool leather under her chin. The intruder quickly removed the scarf and looked into her eyes.</P>
<P>&quot;Shhh....shhh.&quot; The voice was calming, vaguely familiar. Soon, her breathing leveled off and her body
relaxed. A leather-clad finger pressed to her lips indicating that she should remain quiet. Danielle did not utter
a sound. She was entranced, lost in her thoughts as she tried to recall the melodic whisper.</P>
<P>She watched the intruder pull a roll of tape from the backpack and tear off a small length. The soothing eyes
watched her intently while gentle fingers wiped her tears and pushed several loose strands of hair from her face.
Danielle thought she saw the eyes sadden as the tape was placed over her mouth. She met their gaze for but an instant
before the thief backed away, in a movement so fluid it seemed an apparition.</P>

<P align=center>*****</P>

<P>Alex Lord stood at the bathroom sink. Tonight’s job had come close to ending badly. Too close. The old man was
supposed to be the only resident. Her information had been wrong. There were too many mistakes on her part, enough
to warn her that she was losing her edge. She removed the brown contacts and looked into the mirror. Her blue eyes
reflected the concern she felt.</P>
<P>She stripped out of her dark work clothes and slipped into her robe. The experience had shaken her. She had
allowed her emotions to rule over her better judgment. Her steely control was slipping, something she could little
afford.</P>
<P>She poured herself a scotch and walked across the room to the fireplace. It was the one thing she required of
her temporary residences. This one was magnificent. Sitting by a fire calmed her, made her focus on the present
and push back memories of her past: things better not remembered.</P>
<P>Tonight the brilliant flames reminded her of the golden highlights in the young woman’s hair. She sipped her
drink and tried to concentrate on the problem at hand. She had broken Julian’s number one rule: leave no witnesses.
Yet from the first moment she laid eyes on the blonde, killing her had been out of the question.</P>
<P>She tried to rationalize her decision. The woman had seen nothing. She would not be able to identify her. Unlike
Alex, who sensed she would never forget this woman. The blonde’s image was seared in her mind’s eye. She felt a
pulling deep inside as she pictured the woman bathed in soft light and tried to dim the image with a long sip of
scotch. She grimaced. Letting the woman live hadn’t been her only breach of his rules.</P>
<P>Something about this woman had thrown her off balance. Although they had never met, there was a familiarity
that unnerved Alex. It was as if part of her awakened when she first looked into the blonde’s emerald eyes. It
distressed her beyond her understanding to see the woman’s confusion and fear as she had bound and gagged her.
To Alex she seemed the embodiment of innocence, completely naive and uncomprehending of the treachery that necessitated
such an act.</P>
<P>Alex became increasingly uncomfortable as she recalled the young woman’s panic as she struggled for breath.
What a stupid move that had been. Knocking her unconscious would have been more logical and certainly kinder, but
it had never even occurred to her. The mere idea of striking this woman was disturbing. Rubbing her eyes, she finished
her drink and refilled the glass. Ten years was too long for anyone to be in this business.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">*****</P>
<P>Danielle sat motionless after the thief had gone. Her heart pounded furiously. This was the closest she had
ever come to real danger. She felt utterly charged. The adrenaline rush lingered, making all of her senses more
acute. Danielle listened intently for any sign of her uncle, silently praying he was all right. She tried to wriggle
her hands free but the belt held her securely. She was considering tipping the chair over when a noise down stairs
caught her attention. Her heart thudded loudly as footfalls approached.</P>
<P>She watched the door anxiously as two police officers rounded the corner into the room. Relief washed through
her. They had responded so quickly that she wondered if the thief had been caught.</P>
<P>A young officer peeled the tape back from her mouth.</P>
<P>&quot;My uncle, is he okay?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We haven’t found him yet, ma’am.&quot; He began working on the knots binding her hands.</P>
<P>&quot;His bedroom is the last on the left.&quot;</P>
<P>The officer motioned to his partner to check and continued untying her. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I think so.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It was fortunate that a neighbor noticed something suspicious and called us.&quot; Danielle rubbed her
wrists and moved toward the door to check on her uncle.</P>
<P>She released an anxious breath as she watched him rush down the hall toward her. &quot;Honey are you all right?&quot;
He hugged her tightly.</P>
<P>&quot;I’m fine. Are you okay?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I’m embarrassed to say that I never even woke up.&quot;</P>
<P>The police officer interrupted him. &quot;Sir, can you show us where you keep your valuables?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly, the safe is located down the hall.&quot; He lead the officer to the large study.</P>
<P>Danielle went back to her room and sat on the bed, her relief was followed by a sudden weariness.</P>
<P>&quot;Can I get you a drink of water?&quot; the policeman asked politely.</P>
<P>&quot;No thank you. I’m just a little shaky, I’ll be fine.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ma’am, were you hurt... in any way?&quot; His question was awkward, tentative.</P>
<P>&quot;No, he didn’t hurt me.&quot; She thought back to how gentle he had been.</P>
<P>&quot;You were lucky. These things can be very nasty sometimes.&quot;</P>
<P>A short blonde man walked into the room and stepped forward to introduce himself. &quot;Ms. Stafford is it?&quot;
She nodded.</P>
<P>&quot;My name is detective Bowin, I know this has been a trying evening but I need to ask you a few questions.
Do you feel up to talking about what happened?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot; But even as she began answering his questions, she felt a heaviness settle in her limbs.</P>
<P>&quot;The style of this robbery is similar to other cases I’ve been following.&quot; There was one glaring exception
that he didn’t mention. Until now, the thief he had been tracking had been too clever to leave witnesses. The jobs
had been well planned and perfectly executed. He hoped he finally had the breakthrough he’d been looking for.</P>
<P>&quot;Anything you might remember would be helpful.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle spoke about her brief interaction with the thief as the detective took notes. Confused by the robe
and choking incidents, she purposely left them out.</P>
<P>Detective Bowin tried to establish as many details as possible while they were still fresh in her mind. His
questioning went on for nearly forty minutes before he noticed her exhaustion and finally eased off. He ended by
asking her to come by the station the next day to finish her statement.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">*****</P>
<P>Her uncle circled her like a mother hen. He was appalled that she had to endure such a thing and kept wandering
into her room to make sure she was all right. Finally, realizing there wasn’t anything more he could do, he let
her rest.</P>
<P>Although tired, Danielle was too keyed up to sleep. Her mind was flooded with conflicting emotions. The police
had handled her with care, as if she were in shock, and maybe she was. Why else would she have purposely misled
them about his height and the color of his eyes? Although it made no sense, she felt reluctant to see him captured.
There was something in his manner that had been almost apologetic. She blushed as she remembered how her skin had
tingled when he touched the tip of his finger to her lips.</P>
<P>Danielle berated herself for these irrational thoughts. She could have been raped or killed. She was being foolishly
sentimental. Still, somehow deep inside she knew that she had never been in danger. She was certain that he never
would have harmed her, even though it defied all logic. Danielle shivered as she thought of his eyes riveted to
hers, his gentle touch and soothing voice. Her senses had been keenly alert through the whole experience. She remembered
the aroma of his leather jacket and something else, something that tugged at the edge of her memory. Danielle glanced
around the room for an item that might have held his scent. There was nothing, even the scarf he had used to gag
her was gone.</P>
<P>She scolded herself for romanticizing. He was a common thief, who had broken in, tied her up and taken what
didn’t belong to him. The safe had been cleared out. Over two million dollars in jewels and cash were stolen.</P>
<P>Even so, the loss was minor in scope of her uncle’s wealth. But there was one item among the contents of the
safe that could never be replaced: her mother’s medallion. It had been handed down through the generations to the
eldest daughter on their twenty-third birthday. In a couple of weeks it would have been hers. Now the tradition
would end. The thief had taken a piece of her birthright along with the jewels.</P>
<P>The thought distressed her. Feeling too edgy to sleep, she decided to write in her journal and discovered it
wasn’t where she had left it. An exhaustive search of the house turned up nothing. A chilling thought occurred
to her. Maybe the thief had taken it. The idea seemed ludicrous but she had no other way to explain its disappearance.</P>
<P>Her pulse quickened as she thought of him reading her private thoughts. What could he want with her diary? Was
he hoping to find information, secrets? Her mind jumped to a variety of unpleasant conclusions. Luckily she had
only recently inserted new pages, filing the old entries away.</P>
<P>She tried to recall what she had written in the last few weeks and groaned as she remembered the park. Was she
allowing her vivid imagination to get the best of her? Surely if he had taken the journal, he would throw it out,
probably without even reading it.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">*****</P>
<P>Alex poured herself another drink. Her behavior this evening was worrisome. She was indeed slipping. How else
could she explain her phone call to the police? She squeezed her eyes shut. God, what had she been thinking?</P>
<P>She grabbed her leather jacket from the chair and pulled the colorful scarf out of the pocket. Her mind flashed
back to the fear she had seen in the young woman’s eyes, and she winced. Remembering the woman’s suffering distressed
her. Hoping to erase the vision, she stuffed the scarf deep into the pocket.</P>
<P>Her reason for alerting the police was simple. The thought of the innocent woman bound and uncomfortable had
been unbearable. She had to call.</P>
<P>Her actions were completely out of character. She never allowed herself such sentimentality. It was too dangerous
in her line of work. But there was more to it than that. She couldn’t shake the feeling that she knew this woman
from someplace. Looking into those emerald eyes had felt like coming home. She had wanted to kiss her, to take
her in her arms and protect her from the world. A ridiculous thought, considering she was probably the only one
to ever pose a threat to the young woman.</P>
<P>Alex couldn’t explain her feelings, but it was clear that her heart wasn’t in her work anymore. She would have
stopped years ago, but the decision was no longer hers to make. He was calling the shots now, and she knew it would
never be enough. He owned her.</P>
<P>She walked to the table and dumped out the contents of her bag. It had been a good haul. There was approximately
$500,000 cash and an additional two million in jewels. They were high quality, many antiques. An unusual medallion
caught her attention and she pulled it from the pile. It was oval shaped, made of gold with an intricate spiral
pattern engraved on the front. It was obviously very old. Alex turned it over in her hands, examining it closely
and felt a tingling sensation in her fingertips. She set it down and took another drink.</P>
<P>Her attention was drawn to the leather book. She picked it up and sat next to the fire, gently running her fingers
over the cover. This was old too. The spiral design on the front was similar to the one on the pendant, and there
were symbols she couldn’t decipher. Its pages were held in place with leather ties. The cover was beautifully cured
and oiled. It must have meant a great deal to someone, as it was well cared for. She leafed through the pages and
smiled. She loved the scent of ink. Ever since she was a kid she associated the aroma with pleasant memories.</P>
<P>She glanced at the first page. The handwriting captured her attention right away. It was written with an old
fashion fountain pen. The strokes widened and narrowed with artistic flair. Looking at the page as a whole, the
script formed a beautifully abstract design. The penmanship was flowing, pleasing to the eye. As she looked closely
it became obvious that it was a journal. She took another sip of scotch and began to read.</P>

		<P>7/1</P>
		<P>It was another sleepless night in an unending chain. The darkness calls to me. I’m drawn to the risk, the mystery.
		The element of danger promises fulfillment, an escape from my ordinary life. I hunger for adventure.</P>
		<P>I chose to walk through the park even though my uncle had warned me how dangerous the city was as night. The
		air was warm. I walked quickly, trying to cool myself with the breeze my movements created. I was lost in my thoughts,
		as I so often am.</P>
		<P>A noise to my left caught my attention. I turned and listened. It was a deep moan. Curiosity drew me to the
		sound. The area was dimly lit and I had to strain to see two people in the distance. I edged closer. I was only
		twenty feet way when they came clearly into view. The woman was leaning with her back against a tree. Her lover
		was pressed tightly against her, their mouths locked in a steamy kiss. The woman was delirious with pleasure, her
		moans escaping the seal of their lips.</P>
		<P>I felt like an intruder, but I was transfixed. My feet wouldn’t move. My eyes were locked on their undulating
		bodies. I stood frozen, watching his hands glide up the outside of her thighs, raising the light weight skirt above
		her hips. His lips were moving against her neck and I could see the intensity of her need in her expression.</P>
		<P>The raw sensuality of it, stirred something in me, bringing me to my senses. I stepped back, intending to leave,
		when the unthinkable happened; a twig snapped loudly under my weight. I quickly glanced up to see if the couple
		had heard me.</P>
		<P>They had, both were facing me now. I willed myself to run, but a realization settled over me and I hesitated.
		They were <B><I>both</I></B> women.</P>
		<P>I ran. Flushed with embarrassment, feeling like a common voyeur.</P>
		<P>My reaction to these women confuses me. My interest in this couple makes me more aware than ever that I need
		to get a life. I haven’t been out with anyone in over a year. Dating has always been awkward for me. I’m uncomfortable
		in intimate relationships. There is no desire.</P>
		<P>I thought for a long time that the sexual part of me was dead, but tonight, for the first time, I felt... something.
		Maybe I am capable of those feelings, maybe they are lying dormant, waiting to be awoken. For the first time in
		my life I have a flicker of hope that I might be capable of falling in love.</P>
		<P>It’s time I took the initiative, and tried another date. John, one of the sports reporters at work, has approached
		me several times. He’s friendly and attractive, maybe the time is right. Tomorrow I will ask him out for a drink.</P>
	</ul>
</ul>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<P>Alex was captivated. She felt like a bit of a voyeur herself. But the young woman’s words drew her in and she
couldn’t resist. She smiled and took another drink. Closing her eyes she tried to picture the blonde woman coming
across the couple in the park. Instead she found herself fantasizing about the young woman leaning against the
tree while she kissed her. The image was so vivid it was like reliving a memory.</P>
<P>She frowned when she thought about the sports reporter. Something told her this date idea had disaster written
all over it. Reluctantly, she put the journal down. She needed to contact her fence. It would be dangerous for
her mother and brother if she were late with her payment.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">*****</P>
<P>Alex walked through the dimly lit lot to the back entrance of the pawn shop. She rapped lightly on the door,
and within minutes Sal answered and ushered her in. He hit a button under the counter revealing a hidden panel.
Upon keying in his code the wall behind him slid to one side. There was a metal door behind it. Alex stepped past
him and walked in. Once inside he hit another button causing the wall to slide back into place.</P>
<P>He grinned at her. &quot;The wonders of modern technology.&quot; He loved gadgets, anything and everything electronic
fascinated him.</P>
<P>Alex frowned. &quot;You always did have a flair for the theatrical.&quot;</P>
<P>She had known Sal since the early days. He had a bubbling personality, that, while on occasion grated on her
nerves, she also found endearing. Their relationship was not built on trust, for Alex trusted no one. Rather she
viewed their association as mutually beneficial. He had been fair in his dealings with her and was discrete. It
was in his best interests that she not be caught because their association was very profitable for him.</P>
<P>Although the nature of her work demanded that she relocate frequently, she did business with Sal whenever possible.
There was a familiarity with one another that gave her comfort. He represented consistency in a life riddled with
change.</P>
<P>He carefully emptied the bag she handed him onto the table. &quot;This stuff from the Palanos heist?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Didn’t think that one was yours.&quot; He eyed her curiously. &quot;I’ve never known you to have any witnesses.
What went wrong?&quot; She shrugged in response. Silently wishing she knew the answer. He sorted through the pile
of jewels and continued to make small talk.</P>
<P>&quot;You made the front page of the early edition.&quot;</P>
<P>She looked at him with sudden interest. &quot;What did it say?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Seems the witness is Palanos’ niece, his sister’s kid, ...Danielle something&quot; The mention of the
woman made her pulse quicken.</P>
<P>He picked up the paper from the chair and scanned the article &quot;Yeah, her name is Danielle Stafford.&quot;
He tossed the paper on the table. &quot;Evidently she was just visiting for the weekend.&quot;</P>
<P>He looked up and smiled. &quot;Guess she picked the wrong time to visit.&quot; Noting Alex’s lack of reaction,
he continued.</P>
<P>&quot;Anyway she wasn’t hurt and, if she saw anything, the police aren’t disclosing it. She works for the newspaper.
That’s probably how they got the story so fast. I had to laugh though. The article says the <B><I>man</I></B> got
away with about 2.5 million in cash and jewels.&quot; He saw Alex’s uncharacteristically troubled expression and
tried to cheer her.</P>
<P>&quot;Hey, if she thought you were a man, she didn’t get a very good look. My eye sight isn’t exactly twenty-twenty
but it’s a mistake I would never make.&quot; He grinned at her.</P>
<P>&quot;Don’t be so sure. I wasn’t dressed in typical feminine attire.&quot; She grabbed the paper and read through
the article as he examined the jewels.</P>
<P>&quot;These are nice pieces. Shame to remove them from their settings. Hmm... this is interesting.&quot; He
picked up the medallion and examined it closely.</P>
<P>Alex looked up from her reading and took it from him abruptly. &quot;I’m keeping this.&quot; She pushed it into
her pocket. &quot;How much for the rest?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I’ll give you 1.5.&quot;</P>
<P>She shook her head. &quot;And they call <B>me</B> a thief. Haven’t you made enough to retire yet?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Alex, you know I’m not in it just for the money.&quot; He winked. &quot;I get to meet such interesting
people.&quot;</P>
<P>She ignored his comment and handed him a piece of paper. &quot;Have the money transferred to this account by
Friday.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">*****</P>
<P>Danielle arrived at the station early and waited outside Detective Bowin’s office. There was something about
the place that made her nervous.</P>
<P>Marisa Sands walked past Danielle and entered the office.</P>
<P>&quot;You wanted to see me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah, It looks like we might have a lead on the Palanos case. It seems our man left a witness this time.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, that’s good news.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I’ll tell you though Marse, something about this doesn’t feel right.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You always look a gift horse in the mouth.&quot; She smiled and shook her head.</P>
<P>&quot;Why, after all these robberies, would he slip up? It just doesn’t make sense.&quot; Bowin puzzled.</P>
<P>&quot;They all make mistakes eventually. Maybe this isn’t one of his?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, I’d bet money it is, too many similarities. I can feel it in my bones. And if I’m right, we don’t
have much time. If he holds true to pattern he’ll be moving on soon.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Okay, so what’s our next move?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I want you to sit in on this one. Keep an eye on her while I do the questioning.&quot; She nodded and
looked towards the door.</P>
<P>&quot;You think she’s involved?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I’m not sure. Evidently she doesn’t visit often. Makes me wonder if it’s just bad luck on her part or
something more.&quot;</P>
<P>Marisa shrugged. &quot;Want me to call her in?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah, lets see if she can tell us more.&quot;</P>
<P>Marisa led Danielle into the office. Detective Bowin stood politely to greet her.</P>
<P>&quot;Ms. Stafford, thanks for coming down so early. I hope you’re feeling better today.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, thank you.&quot;</P>
<P>He shook her hand gently. This is my assistant, Detective Sands.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle nodded.</P>
<P>&quot;We won’t keep you long. I just had a few things I wanted to clear up.&quot; His tone was casual but he
watched her carefully.</P>
<P>&quot;You say the thief grabbed you from behind and held one hand over your mouth while he put a knife to your
throat?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you remember which hand held the knife?&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle thought of a moment. &quot;It was the right.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I would like to try a little experiment. See if we can trigger any memories, if that’s okay with you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All right.&quot;</P>
<P>Detective Bowin stepped behind and put his hand over her mouth pulling her back. It felt wrong to Danielle:
his short stature, the body type, the grip, the very presence was different.</P>
<P>&quot;Marisa give it a try.&quot; Marisa positioned herself behind Danielle.</P>
<P>&quot;She’s a bit taller than me. It will give us a different perspective.&quot; Bowin explained.</P>
<P>Marisa pulled Danielle against her, covering her mouth. A shiver went through Danielle. The detective was strong,
forceful. She hadn’t expected that from a woman. There were definite similarities and it unnerved her.</P>
<P>Danielle pulled away, obviously a little rattled.</P>
<P>&quot;Are you okay?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, just brought back some unpleasant memories I guess.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Please have a seat.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So, was he closer to my build or Marisa’s?&quot;</P>
<P>She hesitated only a moment and lied, &quot;closer to your height and stature, I think.&quot; Both detectives
watched her shift nervously.</P>
<P>&quot;When the thief was tying you up, did you notice anything about him? You said his eye color was green.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, green I think.&quot; Her voice quavered slightly. But she recovered quickly. &quot;It’s kind of hazy
and I was frightened.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of course, that’s completely understandable. Was he white then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I think so. He wore gloves and a mask. I never saw his skin.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hmm, but the eye color would indicate someone of light skin.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes&quot; Danielle was feeling uncomfortable with her lies. Why was she protecting the robber?.</P>
<P>&quot;Did he speak to you at all?&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle hesitated again. &quot;No.&quot;</P>
<P>Bowin cast a quick glance at his partner, wondering if she had noticed Danielle’s eyes lower. &quot;Anything
about him that was unusual? Mannerisms, walk?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing I can remember.&quot;</P>
<P>There was something strange going on. Bowin could feel it. He decided not to press the woman too hard. He could
always call her back later.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, that’s all I can think of for now. You’ll be available if we have further questions?&quot; He stood
and smiled. Danielle nodded, wondering if he was asking or telling her.</P>
<P>She was relieved to be leaving. Her head was pounding. She could not imagine what had caused her to lie, but
she had done it with barely a thought. It had almost been instinctive. Uncomfortable with her fabrications, she
wondered if her face may have revealed her discomfort. She took a deep breath as she exited the station. It was
over now and she would just have to deal with the consequences.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">*****</P>
<P>It was early morning by the time Alex arrived home. She poured herself a cup of coffee and settled on the couch.
The journal lay on the table where she had left it. She ran her hand lightly over the smooth leather, her fingers
tracing the curious design. ‘Okay Danielle, how’d the date go?’ Turning the pages to the point she left off, she
began to read.</P>

	<ul>
		<P>7/2</P>
		<P>The date was disastrous. We went out for drinks and then back to his apartment to see his autographed sports
		collectibles. God, how do I manage to get myself into these things? I knew</P>
		<P>early on it wasn’t working out, but I wanted to give it a fair shot. After the second drink, his subtle advances
		escalated to heavy groping and forceful kisses.</P>
		<P>He did all the things that make for effective love scenes in movies, the same things others before him have
		done. I felt nothing. Fortunately, he was oblivious to my disinterest and seemed genuinely reluctant for me to
		leave. At least, I didn’t hurt his feelings. He even asked me out again. At least one of us had a good time. Of
		course, I declined. It wouldn’t be fair to him. What’s the point, I’m hopeless.</P>
		<P>Whatever triggered the sensations in me last night in the park, wasn’t there tonight. Was I attracted to the
		forbidden, the voyeurism, the sense of danger? Maybe it was the simple fact they were both women? But, my body
		had reacted long before I knew their sex, or had something deep within me known it all along? I’m curious.</P>
	</ul>
</ul>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<P>&quot;I’ll bet you are.&quot; Alex smiled. Something told her that the young woman was far from hopeless. She
had seen the fire in those green eyes. It was clear to Alex that the right person would have no trouble stirring
the passion she sensed was smoldering below the surface. She got up to pour another cup of coffee, then sat back
down to continue reading.</P>

<hr size=1 color=black>

		<P>7/3</P>
		<P>I made plans to spend the weekend with my uncle. He is such a kind and lonely man. I feel a little guilty for
		not making more of an effort to visit him since I’ve lived in town. He was so supportive of my decision to move
		here. Without his help, my parents would have made it even more difficult for me. They were dead set against me
		coming out here.</P>
		<P>If it weren’t for my grandmother, I would think that I was adopted. I have nothing in common with my family.
		They are appalled by my need for adventure and will never understand why I broke my engagement to Paul. It was
		the right decision. As nice as he is, I knew we weren’t right for each other. I like him, but I could never love
		him, not the way he wanted.</P>
		<P>My father will never forgive me for the embarrassment I brought to the family, breaking the engagement and leaving
		town. But, my leaving was hardest on my mother. It made the memories of my grandmother surface. When I left, I
		could see the pain in her face. I knew she was remembering my grandmother’s scandalous affair.</P>
		<P>It took all my courage to leave what was safe and familiar. I could have spent my entire life trying to fit
		in there. I never would have. I had to find myself.</P>
		<P>7/4</P>
		<P>I went to see the fireworks with some women from the paper. They were spectacular. I’ve always enjoyed looking
		up at the night sky. The stars fascinate me. My friends seemed much less interested in the fireworks than the men
		that passed by.</P>
		<P>I feigned interest in their observations. Puzzled by what they found so alluring. None of the men we saw interested
		me physically. But then, they never do.</P>
		<P>After the night in the park, I find myself thinking about women, wondering if that’s where my attraction lies.
		I’m more aware of women since that night. I appreciate the beauty of the female form. The soft sloping curves of
		a woman’s body are pleasing to me. Still, there is no physical attraction except for that glimmer of feeling I
		had watching the women in the park.</P>
		<P>I will be twenty-three in a couple of weeks. That has been a milestone year for women in my family. My grandmother
		was that age when her life changed. Maybe it will be my year for self discovery, too.</P>
		<P>7/5</P>
		<P>Six years of journalism and I’m stuck writing obituaries. If only I could get a shot at writing a real story.
		I’ve only worked at the paper for five months but I’ve got some great ideas. I wish they would let me try one.
		I sent the outline for the domestic violence story to Liz, the editor of the women’s section. I wonder if she bothered
		to read it. It’s just the kind of story I have dreamt of doing. An opportunity to help people through my writing.</P>
		<P>Elaine encouraged me to follow through with my idea for the story and agreed to talk to the women at the shelter
		about setting up a meeting. She has been the director for a number of years. They have come to trust and respect
		her. I hope we are able to get a few to participate. She thinks it might give some women in abusive situations
		the courage to leave.</P>
		<P>I owe Elaine a phone call. We haven’t gotten together in a couple of weeks. She has been a good friend to me,
		but lately her attempts to set me up with her male friends have made me uncomfortable. She only wants me to be
		happy. I guess I’m going to have to work up the nerve to discuss it with her.</P>
		<P>7/6</P>
		<P>I have been trying to avoid John all week but today he caught up with me at lunch. I don’t know how to let him
		down easy. Although he’s a nice guy, I don’t think that he has any close friends. I should have left things as
		they were. Now, our friendship seems strained. I’ll have to talk to Elaine. She usually knows how to handle these
		relationship things. Who knows, maybe she could set him up with one of her female friends.</P>
		<P>Maybe I should ask her to set <B>me</B> up with one of her female friends.</P>
		<P>Since the night in the park, I haven’t been sleeping well. I am restless. Until that night I thought little
		about sex. Now my dreams are filled with longing. I chase a stranger whose face eludes me.</P>
		<P>&nbsp;7/7</P>
		<P>I walk the park nightly, secretly hoping I will see the lovers. I can’t stop thinking of them. They haunt me.
		I can’t shake the feeling that they hold the key that would unlock my heart and end my loneliness.</P>
		<P>I believe the answer is linked with this incident. I don’t know what I’m searching for, only that I can’t give
		up trying to find it. I feel on the verge of discovering something I once knew and have now forgotten. There is
		a piece of myself that is missing. Without it, I’m incomplete.</P>
		<P>It’s a promise of something wonderful, something I have waited my entire life for. My eyes linger on each woman
		I pass and I wonder if they are one of the lovers from that night.</P>
		<P>7/8</P>
		<P>An odd thing happened at the hair stylist’s today. I was waiting to have my hair trimmed when I glanced at the
		woman seated in front of me. It wasn’t the woman herself that caught my eye, but her hair. She slid a towel off
		her head, revealing long dark hair. It was wet and hung in tangles down her shoulders. I felt a shiver run down
		my spine.</P>
		<P>I watched entranced as she ran her fingers through it, shocked that I wanted to do the same. I don’t know how
		long I stared at her. Time had stopped for me. My heart was pounding furiously. She turned to pick up a magazine
		from the counter and faced my direction. She was beautiful, but somehow I felt disappointed. What had I expected?
		Who had I expected? Did the woman against the tree in the park have long dark hair? I can’t remember. I’m not sure
		that I even noticed. I only know since that night I have changed.</P>
	</ul>

<P>Alex put the journal down and stretched. She wondered for a moment what Danielle would think of her long dark
hair. She ran her fingers though it and laughed at herself. What an unlikely pair they would be. They were as opposite
as night and day.</P>
<P>Although they were worlds apart, the similarities in their circumstances hadn’t escaped her. Something was lacking
in her life too. Loneliness was a pain she had learned to bear. Like Danielle, she had never been able to commit
to a relationship. She took care not to let her guard down. It was the one valuable lesson Julian had taught her.
But, unlike this innocent woman, not committing hadn’t stopped her from using lovers of both sexes. In her short
life, she had slept with numerous men and women. But, for her part it was always a manipulation, she had never
opened her heart to anyone. She never felt love for them.</P>
<P>Reluctantly, she closed the journal. There were many things she had to take care of, and she needed to rest.
Her fingers slowly caressed the journal’s surface. The spiral design on the front fascinated her. Hesitantly, she
laid it down and walked to the bedroom.</P>
