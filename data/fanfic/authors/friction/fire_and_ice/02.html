<P>When Danielle arrived at work their was a message for her from Liz, the editor of the women’s section. She could
barely contain her excitement as she made her way to her office. As she approached the door, Liz motioned her in.</P>
<P>&quot;Dear, I’m so sorry to hear about the robbery. I’m glad you weren’t hurt.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It wasn’t bad really, just a little excitement.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do the police have any leads on the robber yet?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, I don’t’ think so. When I stopped this morning to give them a statement, they didn’t mention anything.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I’m sure you’re tired of the whole thing.&quot; Liz paused and smiled. &quot;I have some news that should
make your day. I like your idea for the battered women’s story.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Really?&quot; Danielle brightened.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. It’s a fresh approach on an old topic. The idea of following up on a story done five years ago, to
see how the shelter’s program may have changed these women’s lives, is intriguing. It’s a good human interest piece.
I’m giving you the go ahead to do a small three part series.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That’s great! Thank you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This is your chance. I want part one on my desk by next Tuesday.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle’s thoughts were racing. This was the crack in the door she had been waiting for. If she could make
this series a success, she would be given the opportunity to do more writing.</P>
<P>She hurried back to her desk to contact Elaine, the director of the Domestic Violence Program. When she had
first arrived in town, she had made an appointment to see Elaine to discuss her idea. They hit it off immediately
and quickly became friends. Elaine was a rather petite woman with long curly hair. What she lacked in stature she
made up for in her serious no nonsense demeanor. Having been abused herself she was the perfect role model to guide
these women into safer lives. Danielle dialed excitedly. She could hardly wait to tell her friend the good news.</P>
<P>&quot;Hi, Elaine.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hey, I’ve been trying to reach you all morning. I read the paper. Are you okay?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I couldn’t be better. Listen, I’ll tell you all about that later.&quot; She paused unable to keep the
excitement from her voice. &quot;You aren’t going to believe this, but I got the go ahead for the series we discussed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That’s terrific! I thought you had something there.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Have you had any luck setting up a meeting?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, of the 35 woman who were in the program when the last story was written, nine agreed to be interviewed
by you this evening at the center.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That’s great.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Danielle, I assured these women that their identifies would be kept confidential. I can’t stress how important
that is.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I understand. Elaine, thanks for your help with this.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You bet, I think it can be a positive thing for the center.&quot; From Elaine’s first meeting with the
young woman, she was touched by her need to help others. Danielle was genuinely interested in the program and enthusiastic
in her desire to inspire battered women to seek help. Elaine felt that printing the stories of women who had been
successful in turning their lives around could only encourage others.</P>
<P>&quot;Okay, I’ll see you tonight then.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And Danielle, tonight I want to hear all about this robbery thing.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle was still smiling when she hung up the phone.</P>
<P align=center>*****</P>
<P>Elaine walked Danielle to the small conference room and stepped up to the podium in the front of the room to
introduce her. Danielle glanced at the nine rather anxious women seated before her and touched Elaine’s arm, stopping
her introduction.</P>
<P>&quot;I’m sorry Elaine, I don’t mean to interrupt but this isn’t exactly what I had in mind.&quot; She spoke
to the women before her. &quot;Is there some place more comfortable we can sit and talk? A lounge or kitchen maybe?
I don’t know about the rest of you but I would love a cup of coffee.&quot;</P>
<P>Elaine lead them to the kitchen, where they all gathered around the large table. Danielle sat on the counter
facing the others. &quot;My name is Danielle Stafford, Elaine has probably explained why I wanted to meet you here.
I was hoping you would be willing to share your stories.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Aren’t you going to tape us or something?&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle smiled. &quot;I don’t use a recorder. I like things informal, besides I have a knack for remembering
details. Ever since I was a child I loved hearing people talk about their lives. I’d like to keep this casual if
it’s okay with all of you.&quot; There was a perceptible shift in the room as the women relaxed.</P>
<P>A woman with short red hair spoke up. &quot;Why do you want to hear <B>our</B> stories? None of us are important.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I think everyone has a story to tell. But in addition to that, all of you are in a unique position. You
have faced difficult times and made it through them. I believe that other women in similar positions might find
hope for themselves in your stories. My intention is to reach out to them and show them there’s a way out.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What about confidentially?,&quot; a tall willowy woman asked. &quot;Some of us are worried that our husbands
might track us down.&quot;</P>
<P>A woman with short cropped dark hair interrupted. &quot;I come back to the shelter to help out when I can. I
know Danielle. She spends a lot of time here. I trust her.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thanks Spike, I don’t intend to use any names and I will keep details from the stories that would disclose
too much. I’ll give each of you the opportunity to look over what I’ve written before it’s printed. If there is
anything you object to or are uncomfortable with, I’ll change it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That sounds fair enough.&quot; A woman with long blonde hair commented. The other women nodded in agreement.</P>
<P>&quot;Great, I’d love to hear your stories. Anyone feel comfortable starting things off?&quot;</P>
<P>The dark-haired woman spoke. &quot;I think Ann should start.&quot; She turned to face a plain looking woman
with straight brown hair. &quot;If you feel up to it?</P>
<P>Ann looked up shyly and cleared her throat. Her hands trembled as she clutched them in her lap. She nodded.</P>
<P>&quot;My name is Ann. I got married when I was sixteen. There were nine children in my family. My leaving meant
one less mouth to feed so my folks didn’t care. My husband was in training to be a police officer and I felt pretty
lucky that a man in such an important position would marry me. The men he worked with really liked him. His friends
nicknamed him ‘ice’ because he never lost his temper, at least not around them. What they didn’t know was that
he saved up all his anger for me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Anyway, that lucky feeling I had didn’t last long. In the fifteen years I was married to him I lost track
of the number of times I was knocked unconscious. He hit me nearly every day. Any problem at work was reason enough
to come home and beat the tar out of me. My nose has been broken so many times I forget what it used to look like.&quot;
She shook her head in frustration, &quot;But I stayed with him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I had four miscarriages. I think my body was worn out from all the beatings. Probably had a lot of bruises
inside too. After I lost those four babies, my husband decided he wanted one for real and the beatings lessened.
I ended up giving birth to the son he wanted.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I was happy during those months when I was carrying my son. It was the most peaceful time I’d known in
my marriage. I thought the baby was my salvation. But, shortly after his birth the beatings started up again. I
didn’t mind so much cause I had Josh. He was the sweetest little boy, so shy...&quot; she paused and looked down
at her hands. The woman to her right lightly touched her shoulder, bringing her out of her thoughts.</P>
<P>&quot;One time, not long after Josh turned seven, my husband had to take me to the hospital. I was broke up
pretty good that time. I’m sure I should have gone to the hospital for a lot of the injuries I had over the years,
but it was hard to explain to the doctors how I got that way, so most times I suffered alone at home.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This time when I peed, I could see red. I knew it was bad. The doctors said it was good I came in. They
had to sew me up inside. My husband told them I took a bad fall and, since he was a police officer, they believed
him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I knew I came close to dying and after I got home I began to think about my son and what would become
of him if something happened to me. After a while I worked up the courage to ask my parents for help. My father
didn’t believe me. He said I should stop complaining and count my blessings, my husband was a good provider and
they didn’t grow on trees. My mother, who had always born her suffering privately, thought I should do the same.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It was five months after my parents turned me and Josh away that I got the worst beating of my life. He
came home one night drunk and mean. I think I would be dead, but Josh stepped between us to protect me. I’ll never
forget his small body twisted in a heap on the floor. The doctors told me he died instantly. Those few minutes
play over and over in slow motion in my head. Six years later, and I still see them.&quot;</P>
<P>The room fell completely quite as if they shared a common memory. Although her face and voice showed no trace
of emotion, Danielle could see the loss reflected deeply in her eyes: a pain so great that she would forever be
marked by it.</P>
<P>&quot;Even though my husband didn’t mean to hurt Josh, he meant to hit me, he ended up going to jail for it.
I can only hope he will be there a good long time.&quot; She took a deep breath. &quot;Anyway that’s how I found
my way here. I remember how strange it seemed to go to bed without pain and wake up without new bruises.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At first I almost missed it. That must sound funny to you, but for nearly fifteen years the pain was there,
proof that I had survived another day, reminding me I had to be careful not to set him off.&quot; She sighed at
the irony.</P>
<P>&quot;This place saved me. They got me the medical help I needed and kept me safe. It’s been five years, I’ve
been on my own. I have a job working as an clerk in the county morgue. I don’t like being around people much, so
the work suits me. It’s quiet and kinda peaceful.&quot;</P>
<P>There was an awkward silence. An attractive woman with brown hair tied in a pony tail spoke up. The shorter
redheaded woman next to her was holding her hand. &quot;God, we all knew how to pick ‘em, didn’t we.&quot; The
women laughed in agreement.</P>
<P>&quot;By the way, my name is Nikki&quot; She looked at Danielle. &quot;Our stories are similar except for a
few different twists here and there. All of us...&quot; She waved her arm to indicated everyone in the room. &quot;we
are the fortunate ones, we survived. Many women don’t.&quot; She looked lovingly at the woman seated beside her.
&quot;Kate and I met here. We both had feelings for women from the earliest time we could remember but we got trapped
in loveless, abusive marriages trying to fit in and be ‘normal’. Whatever that is.&quot; She rolled her eyes. &quot;Anyway,
after several years of being close friends, we realized that we loved each other. We’ve been together as a couple
for over two years. It’s the happiest I’ve ever been.&quot;</P>
<P>Her partner nodded and squeezed her hand. &quot;We went to school to become Emergency Medical Technicians. In
fact, we work for the same ambulance company, usually on the same shift. The job’s different everyday. We like
that. Both of us are kind of adventurous. But the best part of our work is being able to help people when they
need it most.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I think everyone here would agree that Elaine deserves the credit for giving us a second chance in life.
She works hard helping women like us. Your story should really focus on her and the good she does.&quot; Everyone
voiced their agreement. The bond these women shared was tangible. Danielle could almost feel the aura that surrounded
them. It was a wonderful thing.</P>
<P>The brassy young woman with the spiky hair and vibrant eyes chimed in. &quot;For those of you who don’t know
me, my name is Tara, but my friends call me Spike.&quot; She ran her hand through her shortly cropped hair for
clarification and smiled. &quot;I used to be a hooker. I was in an abusive relationship with my pimp, but only
for three years. So I was luckier than some. But like the rest, I never knew what was going to set him off. I blamed
myself, thought it was my fault. I wonder to this day why I stayed as long as I did. But you know, in spite of
it all I cared for him. After a bad attack, he would be so attentive and loving. At times it seemed almost worth
the beating.&quot;</P>
<P>Several of the women nodded in understanding.</P>
<P>&quot;You see, they break you down over time. It’s not only physical. There is mental abuse too. Anyway I’m
a survivor, thanks to the support of Elaine and the women from the shelter. Believe it or not, I’m a stunt woman
in television now. I figured I been thrown around enough that it seemed right down my alley.&quot;</P>
<P>The women laughed softly.</P>
<P>&quot;Yep, life experience gave me most of the training I needed.&quot; She smiled wryly. &quot;The best part
is that now, they pay me for it and pretty well I might add.&quot;</P>
<P>Rachel, the long-haired blonde sitting on the end was the next to speak. &quot;Yeah, it’s ironic the path life
leads us down. I was completely dependent on my husband. My life revolved around him. Leaving was the farthest
thing from my mind. The neighbors used to call the cops when they heard him ranting. When the police came, they
never did anything. So after I got my life straightened around, I decided to become a cop. I found my own power;
the kind that comes from deep inside. There were so many times I prayed for someone to be there to help me. In
the end, I had to take that first step myself. The rest wouldn't have been possible without Elaine. I want to make
a difference, like she has. I want to help women like me. And the best part is, I think I have. At least I’ve tried.
Although I’m new on the force, I make an effort to see that the police are more aware of the problems abused women
face and why they are reluctant to press charges and ask for help. I try to stop by the center on a regular basis
to encourage the new women. When they first get here they are so down on themselves. All the good feelings have
been beaten out of them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I know Danielle too. She’s a good friend. I wanted to be interviewed, the story is a good idea. Battered
women need to see that there’s still hope.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle smiled, &quot;Every now and then we all need to be reminded of that.&quot;</P>
<P>They talked until late. Each woman elaborating on her tale. Danielle listened intently to their stories. They
were compelling and often heartbreaking. She was amazed by their strength and courage. They had found their places
in life and were making their unique contribution. If only she could find hers.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">*****</P>
<P>Danielle stirred, her mind deep in the throws of a dream. She was in the park. Looking for the lovers she'd
become obsessed with. They weren't there. She walked to the tree and ran her fingers against the rough bark. A
soft sound behind her made her turn. It was him, the thief, his face covered by the mask. He took a step toward
her, raising a gloved finger to his lips. Her heart raced as he came closer, leaving only a few inches between
them.</P>
<P>Strong hands settled firmly on her waist, easing her back against the tree. His eyes met hers, silently questioning.
She placed her hands over his and guided them down over the curve of her hips. She moaned as she felt the cool
fabric of her skirt caress her skin as he lifted it. Her heart hammered. She prayed he wouldn’t stop. She slipped
her hands under his leather jacket and froze as they came in contact with the gently sloping curve of breasts.
Her eyes snapped open.</P>
<P>It took her some time to fall back asleep.</P>
<P>A loud crash woke her the second time, something breaking. It was followed by a male voice raised in anger.
It sounded like her neighbors were fighting. So much for the joys of apartment living. She tried to block out his
angry voice. She was ready to grab for a pillow to cover her ears, when she heard a woman’s scream, followed by
a loud bang. Something was wrong. She picked up the phone and called the police.</P>
<P>The ranting continued. She quickly dressed in sweats and went to the door of their apartment. She could hear
a muffled voice through the door.</P>
<P>&quot;You bitch, what did I tell you about staying out of my things!&quot;</P>
<P>A woman’s voice pleaded in the background. &quot;Not the stomach... please.&quot; There was a sickening crack.</P>
<P>Danielle knocked loudly. It became quiet, and she heard footsteps approach. A very handsome man opened the door.
She was rather taken back by his appearance. The expression on his face was so casual that she felt she had made
a mistake.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes?&quot; His voice was calm. His look questioning.</P>
<P>&quot;I heard... screaming, I was concerned that someone might be hurt.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh that, I’m sorry. We must have had the television too loud. I apologize.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of course, I’m sorry I bothered you.&quot; Danielle’s face colored. Embarrassed for jumping to a rash
conclusion. She guessed it wasn’t too surprising since she had spent the evening listening to stories of abuse.</P>
<P>She was about to leave when she noticed blood spattered on the front of his shirt. Danielle tried to keep a
neutral expression on her face. Her mind searched for a way to stall him until the police arrived. &quot;I live
across the hall.&quot; She put her hand out in greeting. &quot;Danielle Stafford.&quot; He took it awkwardly.</P>
<P>&quot;Drake Morrison&quot;. His hands were cold, clammy, not nearly as composed as his face.</P>
<P>&quot;It’s nice to meet you.&quot; He smiled warmly. His voice was so charming, compared to the raging she had
heard moments before, that it caused a chill to run through her.</P>
<P>&quot;I promise we’ll keep the noise down in the future.&quot; He began to close the door when she heard a low
groan and a terrible wet coughing sound. She held her hand out stopping the door and looked at him questioningly.</P>
<P>&quot;My wife’s got a cold. Bad time of year for that kind of thing.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I’ve had some first aid training. Maybe I could take a look at her?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thanks, but that’s not really necessary. She’s seeing our family doctor.&quot; A small cry for help came
from behind him.</P>
<P>His expression hardened, and he glanced over his shoulder. Danielle pushed past him. About ten feet in front
of her she saw a woman sprawled on the kitchen floor. She hurried toward her and nearly slipped in a pool of blood.
Danielle had never seen a face so savagely brutalized. She knelt on the other side of the woman, careful not to
turn her back to him. She watched him cautiously as he approached. His face stricken.</P>
<P>&quot;She fell.&quot;</P>
<P>The terrified woman whimpered like a wounded animal. Danielle laid her hand lightly on the woman’s shoulder,
in an attempt to calm her. The comment didn’t even rate an answer. Her contempt for this man rose like bile. &quot;You
can tell it to the police. They’ll be here any minute.&quot;</P>
<P>His mouth opened in confusion. He ran his fingers through his hair nervously. Then, without a word, he turned
and headed into another room.</P>
<P>The woman grabbed Danielle’s hand. &quot;He’s going for his gun... he’s going to kill us.&quot; Another violent
cough brought up blood. Danielle had no reason to doubt her. She pulled the woman to her feet and struggled toward
her apartment. They made it into the hall before he caught up to them.</P>
<P>Danielle leaned the woman against her door and stepped in front of her protectively. &quot;Don’t make things
worse for yourself. Put the gun down.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You should have minded your own business, bitch!&quot; The change in his expression was terrifying. Like
Jekyll and Hyde. Danielle tried to keep her composure. She had to buy them time.</P>
<P>&quot;You're right, I have a real problem that way. But this can still be fixed.&quot; She paused gauging his
reaction. &quot;When the police come, we can say she fell down the steps. That would explain the noises I heard.
I know you didn’t mean to hurt her. She knows that too.&quot; She could see that he was considering her words.
She just needed time.</P>
<P>A car backfired outside. He spun around to look, startled by the noise, when he turned back to face them, Danielle
drove the palm of her hand into his nose. The gun flew from his hand and rattled down the stairs. He buckled and
clutched his nose painfully. She used her momentary advantage to push the woman through the door to her apartment,
locking it behind her.</P>
<P>The man pounded so violently that Danielle feared the door would give in. She grabbed for the phone and dialed
911. They calmly assured her help was coming. Danielle hung up the phone and shoved a chair under the door knob.
Slipping her arm around the trembling woman’s back she moved her to the couch. The woman looked about eight months
pregnant. As Danielle watched a trickle of blood run down the inside of the woman’s thigh, she silently prayed
the police and ambulance would arrive in time to save the woman and her child.</P>
<P>In the distance she could hear the sirens approach. She took the woman’s hand in her own. &quot;Hold on, it’s
going to be all right. Help is coming.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">*****</P>
<P>Alex finished dinner and settled in for the evening. She sat by the fire, curling her legs underneath her, she
paged to the next journal entry.</P>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<ul>
	<ul>
		<P>7/9</P>
		<P>Faceless women with raven hair haunt my dreams. My obsession has prompted me to do something that had previously
		never occurred to me: I decided to go to a lesbian bar.</P>
		<P>I fretted for an hour over what to wear, finally deciding on black jeans and a T-shirt. The club I picked was
		a small smoky little place. I stopped at the bar to get and drink and found a seat in the back where I could watch
		without attracting attention.</P>
		<P>It wasn’t much different from other bars I had been in, with the exception that there were only women there.
		I watched them as they danced, talked, held hands, and kissed. Many of the women were very attractive, but I felt
		nothing. I finished my drink intending to leave, when a tall woman walked by me, headed toward the bar.</P>
		<P>I inhaled and my head reeled. The scent of her leather jacket sent a rush of excitement through me. I watched
		her take a seat at the bar. My eyes were riveted to her back. With a shake of her head, her dark hair cascaded
		down her back. My heart skipped a beat. I watched with interest as she shifted in her seat, amazed at the sensations
		I was experiencing. My entire body tingled. She stood, her hips swaying as she pulled money out of her pocket to
		pay for the shot.</P>
		<P>A pleasant fluttering in my abdomen nearly caused me to gasp out loud. My arm were covered with goose bumps.
		I gently ran my finger over them, thrilling at the sensation. When I looked up she was gone. A panic swept over
		me as I quickly scanned the room. I caught sight of her heading for the door. She was leaving.</P>
		<P>Without thinking, I jumped up and hurried after her. Just as she was about to exit I reached out, grazing her
		lightly on the shoulder. When she turned to face me, my heart fell. She looked at me puzzled. I lamely apologized
		and told her she looked like someone I used to know. As I heard my own words, I felt that somehow they were true.</P>
		<P>She was nice, but I left the bar alone. Unfortunately, I still felt nothing. I had no desire to be with her
		in a sexual way.</P>
		<P>I am more desperately lonely than before. I could deal with the fact that I might be a lesbian. What truly depresses
		me is the fact that no one of either sex holds any attraction for me. I’m confused. But, these occasional bursts
		of sensation leave me hopeful. I feel I’m on the verge of a breakthrough. It’s both exciting and frightening.</P>
		<P>&nbsp;7/10</P>
		<P>Mother called today to remind me about the medallion. She wanted to make sure my uncle remembered to give it
		to me next week on my birthday. It surprises me how much this tradition means to her considering how strained her
		relationship was with my grandmother. She never got over the hurt and embarrassment of her mother leaving my grandfather
		for a woman. She felt abandoned and could never understand how my grandmother could put a mysterious woman before
		her own child.</P>
		<P>I never knew my grandmother. She died before I was born. Mother never talked about her. I understood even at
		a very young age that the subject was not to be brought up. My mother only discussed her with me one time and it
		was very brief. The day my grandfather died I found her in the backyard burning stacks of papers. Her face was
		wet with tears. In a fit of anger she had burned the letters my grandmother had written to her throughout the years.</P>
		<P>I never understood the magnitude of this loss until I was older. Now, I would give anything to have those letters.
		A sense of my heritage has always been important to me. I have recorded my thoughts since I was a child. Writing
		is a life line. I find solace in it no matter how alone I feel. It’s sad that we never knew each other; somehow
		I feel connected to her. I think her thirst for adventure is in my blood.</P>
		<P>Of grandmother’s belongings, mother kept only two: the leather journal I have used since childhood and the medallion.
		As the eldest daughter the medallion will pass to me on my twenty-third birthday as it did to my mother before
		me. Mother never wore it that I know of, but family is very important to her. I think the medallion represents
		a link to her mother. I will treasure it.</P>
	</ul>
</ul>

<hr size=1 color=black>

<P>Alex set the journal down. The enormity of what she had taken from this young woman flooded over her. She knew
somehow she had to set things right.</P>
<P>The ringing of the phone interrupted her thoughts and she moved across the room to answer. It was Sal.</P>
<P>&quot;Thought you might be interested in the late news on channel seven tonight.&quot;</P>
<P>She clicked on her set. Danielle appeared on the screen. Alex watched intently as the cameras panned first to
the woman on the stretcher and then to the concerned face of Danielle Stafford. At the corner of the screen, she
could see a man being directed into the squad car. She recognized the look in his eyes and knew immediately that
Danielle was in trouble.</P>
<P>&quot;Sal, I need you to do a favor for me.&quot;</P>
<P>He was surprised by the request. In all the years he’s known her, Alex had never asked anything of him. &quot;Sure
Alex, what can I do?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have a package I need to have delivered to this Danielle Stafford at the newspaper on Monday. I can’t
have any connection to it. If I drop it by tomorrow morning, can you find someone reliable to handle it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It shouldn’t be a problem.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Make sure the delivery person can’t be traced.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Okay...&quot; He hesitated. &quot;Alex, tell me it’s not a bomb.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That’s hardly my style.&quot; She smiled and shook her head. &quot;And besides, what makes you think I’d
trust you with a bomb?&quot;</P>
<P>He laughed &quot;I had to ask.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sal thanks, I owe you one.&quot;</P>
<P>After hanging up, Alex couldn’t get the young woman off her mind. She sensed danger and she was rarely wrong
about these things. She could think of a hundred reasons why she shouldn’t get involved but none of them mattered.
The instant she had sensed trouble her mind had been made up. She had a few days before she needed to leave town,
enough time to follow this woman and make sure everything was okay.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">*****</P>
<P>The next evening, after visiting the hospital, Danielle went for a long walk. Her mind was swimming. In the
past few days she had experienced more excitement and danger than she had her entire life, but it still left her
wanting.</P>
<P>She walked through the park, stopping by the tree where she had seen the two women. Her fingers brushed the
rough bark. She leaned against it, closing her eyes. Her mind flashed back to her dream. She could feel the strong
hands moving down her hips, the warm breath against her neck. When she opened her eyes the fantasy faded. She felt
empty, alone.</P>
<P>Danielle headed back to her apartment, taking a short cut through a rather deserted neighborhood. Gradually
she became aware of someone behind her and increased her pace. The footfalls behind her quickened, matching her
own. She tried to calm her racing heart, sure her imagination was getting the best of her.</P>
<P>As she turned the corner, she stopped to listen. It was quiet. She took a relieved breath and was about to continue
home, when a hand grabbed her from behind, pulling her into a dark alley. He pushed her roughly into the corner.</P>
<P>It was the Drake, the wife beater, and he had two friends with him. She looked around quickly for a way to escape.
There was very little gap between the men. She was effectively trapped in the corner.</P>
<P>&quot;You never should have interfered in my life, bitch.&quot; A coldness settled in the pit of her stomach.
His confidence surged as he sensed her fear. He smiled menacingly.</P>
<P>&quot;Go ahead, scream.&quot; He taunted her, his voice filled with hate. &quot;No one will hear you.&quot;
She tried to break past him but one of the men caught her and threw her back against the wall.</P>
<P>&quot;I’m going to teach you to mind your own business.&quot; He glanced back at his friend.</P>
<P>&quot;Joe, watch the entrance.&quot; The heavy set man turned and walked toward the street. That left two. She
knew this might be her only chance. She had to act quickly.</P>
<P>As Drake reached out to grab her, she struck out hitting his bruised nose. He stepped back wincing in pain.
But, before she could run, the other man punched her hard in the face. Her head snapped back and hit the brick
wall. She reeled from the blow.</P>
<P>The wife beater wiped a trickle of blood from his nose. His eyes filled with rage. He swung at her face but
she managed to dodge the blow. She tried once again to get past him but he threw her back, punching her savagely
in the stomach. She doubled over with pain. Taking advantage of her weakened state, he grabbed her hair and forced
upright. He hit her several times in the face, splitting her lip. She fought to stay on her feet but her legs were
too wobbly to hold her up and she slumped to the ground.</P>
<P>&quot;Grab her hands.&quot;</P>
<P>The large man pinned her hands above her head, while Drake positioned himself between her legs. &quot;You’re
going to pay for that.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle struggled to free herself, but the man above her was too strong. She felt Drake’s hands slide under
her skirt, pushing it up and knew he meant to rape her. She kicked wildly with her feet as he tore at her underpants.
When she cried out for help, he punched her repeatedly.</P>
<P>Pain flooded her body, draining the strength from her limbs. She lay helpless, praying for unconsciousness.</P>
<P>Her vulnerability excited him. He unfastened his belt and unzipped his pants. His callused hands grabbed her
thighs and forced her legs farther apart. &quot;Here it comes bitch.&quot;</P>
<P>He leaned forward preparing to thrust into her, when a loud thud behind them prompted him to turn. &quot;Joe?&quot;</P>
<P>A tall figure illuminated by the street light, walked slowly toward them. He squinted, struggling in the dim
light to see who approached. It was a woman.</P>
<P>&quot;Joe can’t answer you, I broke his jaw.&quot; Something about her manner and confidence unnerved him. He
stood up quickly, haphazardly zipping his pants.</P>
<P>Alex glanced at the man holding Danielle. &quot;Let her go... NOW!&quot;</P>
<P>He released Danielle and rushed Alex. She threw a round house kick to his chest knocking him to the ground.
He came at her again. This time, she stepped to the side and grabbed his arm, twisting, while jerking it upward,
neatly dislocating his shoulder. He dropped to the ground, screaming in pain. A single punch to the temple knocked
him unconscious.</P>
<P>Drake looked at her fearfully, not sure what he was up against. It was one on one and he didn’t like his odds.
She turned to face him. He saw her face for the first time and his blood ran cold. She was smiling.</P>
<P>&quot;Your fun is over. And mine, is about to begin.&quot; She moved in deliberately slow, giving him time to
think about his predicament. He back up fearfully, but quickly ran out of space.</P>
<P>&quot;Looks like your luck just ran out.&quot; She grabbed him by the neck and pressed him viciously to the
wall. He looked at her in horror as he felt his feet leave the ground. She lifted him like a rag doll. Slowly he
felt her grip tighten, shutting off his air.</P>
<P>Disoriented, and in a great deal of pain, Danielle could think of nothing but escape. She began a torturously
slow crawl toward the street. As she got closer her eyes focused on the back of the tall woman strangling her attacker.
The gurgling sounds he made as he gasped for air sickened her.</P>
<P>&quot;You are a dead man.&quot; Alex snapped, her voice filled with menace. His feet flailed helplessly as he
struggled for breath. His face was flush, an ugly purple color.</P>
<P>&quot;Wait, please.&quot; Danielle tried to get up but her legs failed her. &quot;We need to call the police.&quot;
She pleaded as she crumpled back to the ground in pain.</P>
<P>The tall woman eased her grip, sliding him down the wall, back on his feet. His lungs burned as he took in desperately
needed air. He looked into her eyes. The coldness he saw there terrified him. He prayed the girl would go for the
police. Alex grabbed his crotch and twisted savagely. He released an agonizing cry as the pain tore through him
in an excruciating wave. He feared he was seriously injured.</P>
<P>&quot;No police&quot; She growled.</P>
<P>The words sent a chill through him. Her face was poised only inches from his, her expression feral. He tried
to turn his head away, but she grabbed his face and glared at him. His fear doubled when he saw the predatory look
in her eyes. Understanding he was the prey, his body shook uncontrollably.</P>
<P>&quot;I take care of my own problems. No loop holes. No juries.&quot;</P>
<P>There was something in the tone of the woman’s voice. Danielle knew without a doubt that she intended to kill
him. She spoke again. Her voice weak and filled with pain. &quot;Please don’t do it... not for me.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex paused and breathed deeply. She leaned into his ear and for one chilling moment he thought she might bite
it off. Instead, she tightened her grip on his neck and whispered. &quot;If I ever lay eyes on you again, or hear
that you’ve come within a hundred miles of her, I will kill you... slowly.&quot;</P>
<P>She glared at him. He nodded, tears streaming down his face. &quot;If anything happens to her, I’m coming after
you.&quot; Her knee ground into his groin, and he nearly passed out from the pain. She released him, letting him
collapse to the ground, his pants soiled by his own blood and urine.</P>
<P>Danielle clutched her stomach, and tried to rise. Alex went to her side and gently picked her up, carrying her
out of the alley. Danielle squeezed her eyes shut as her stomach spasmed and ripples of pain rolled through her.
&quot;I’m going to be sick...&quot;</P>
<P>Alex eased her to the ground and held back her hair as the she vomited, her bruised muscles clenching painfully.
Alex untucked her own shirt and used it to wipe the young woman’s mouth.</P>
<P>&quot;Easy... it’s okay.&quot; She held her, speaking softly. Her soothing voice had a wonderfully calming effect.
Danielle’s body relaxed in response. She slowly opened her eyes and looked at the face of the woman who had saved
her. A gasp escaped her lips.</P>
<P>Alex misunderstood her reaction. She tightened her hold on the young woman, cradling her in her arms. &quot;I
won’t let anyone hurt you.&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle knew without question that this was the one, the soul she sought. Fate had brought them together. She
stared into Alex’s blue eyes and prayed she wasn’t hallucinating. &quot;Are you real? Am I dreaming?&quot;</P>
<P>Alex smiled softly. &quot;I’m real.&quot; Danielle closed her eyes as a wave of pain rolled through her. Alex
gently pushed her hair from her face, taking a quick inventory of the damage. The young woman grimaced in pain
as Alex ran her hand over the bruised ribs. Her injuries didn’t seem life-threatening but she was reluctant to
take unnecessary chances.</P>
<P>&quot;I’m going to take you to the hospital.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, please.&quot; Danielle knew if her family found out it would be impossible to convince them she would
be safe remaining in the city. She tried to get up, but dizziness toppled her back into Alex’s protective arms.</P>
<P>&quot;Do you live near here?&quot;</P>
<P>Danielle could not make out her words, but she listened, finding comfort in the steady voice. Finally, the picture
was complete: the voice, the hair, the eyes. The last thought to cross Danielle’s mind before she lost consciousness
was leather, the biting scent of leather. She knew she was safe. A weariness descended on her, and she gave into
it without a struggle.</P>
<P>Alex made the decision to respect the woman’s wishes. She would take her home with her, and they could talk
more about it in the morning. She carried Danielle to her car and settled her gently into the passenger seat, buckling
her safety belt. Danielle was in a world of hurt, even in unconsciousness her body reacted to every bump in the
road. Alex drove carefully trying to spare her discomfort. Twenty minutes later, they pulled up in front of Alex’s
cabin.</P>
<P>She carried the young woman in and laid her on the waterbed. Alex used a damp wash cloth to wipe the dried blood
from Danielle’s face. She took great care not cause her further pain. When she had finished she allowed herself
the luxury of lightly running her fingers through her soft blonde hair.</P>
<P>Danielle’s lashes flickered, and her eyes opened. Her body ached. As the horrors of the night flooded over her
once again, her stomach rebelled. She raised her hand weakly to her mouth. Alex carried her into the bathroom,
where Danielle dropped to her knees. She retched into the toilet, her stomach long ago empty. Alex knelt beside
her, an arm supporting her shoulders and gently wiped her face with a cool cloth.</P>
<P>Danielle went limp in Alex’s arms and the tears came. &quot;God if you hadn’t come...&quot; She cried for her
helplessness, her vulnerability. For the first time she had an idea of what the women at the shelter had faced.
&quot; I... I need a shower.&quot;</P>
<P>The sight of the battered young woman broke her heart. &quot;Are you strong enough to stand?&quot; Danielle
nodded. Alex started the water and went to get some clean towels.</P>
<P>When she returned Danielle was in the shower. Alex set the robe, towels and toothbrush down and left, gently
closing the door behind her. Much later Danielle emerged from the bathroom. She staggered, exhausted from her efforts.
Alex carefully lifted her and carried her to bed. When she pulled the covers over her, Danielle grimaced. Every
breath, every movement tormented her bruised ribs. She closed her eyes tightly and tried not to cry out.</P>
<P>&quot;I’m going to give you something for the pain.&quot;</P>
<P>Alex removed a medical kit from the closet. She pulled out a hypodermic and quickly unwrapped it from its packaging.
She inserted the needle into a small vial. Carefully eyeing the dosage, she pulled back the covers and injected
the Demerol into the fleshy part of Danielle’s hip. &quot;This will ease your discomfort and help you sleep.&quot;
She gently tucked her in. &quot;I’ll be in the next room, if you need anything, just call.&quot; Alex stood to
leave.</P>
<P>&quot;Please...&quot; Danielle reached out, imploringly. &quot;Can you stay with me for a while?&quot; Alex
pulled a chair next to bed and took the young woman’s hand. Danielle squeezed tightly and closed her eyes. In a
few minutes the pain eased. She felt marvelously lightheaded, as if she were floating. She curled on her side facing
Alex. Her eyes flickered open not quiet fixing on anything. She pulled Alex’s hand under her cheek and inhaled
deeply.</P>
<P>Just before sleep claimed the young woman, Alex heard her whisper &quot;I always knew you would find me.&quot;</P>
<P>She seemed so frail. It was all Alex could do to look at her bruised face. If she had only gotten there a few
minutes sooner, but she had lost Danielle in the park when a drunk delayed her. Alex wished suddenly that she had
killed all three men. They were monsters. Her anger began to surge but dissipated when she felt the woman’s warm
cheek snuggle against her fingers.</P>
<P>Normally nothing would have prevented her from taking their worthless lives. Alex thought of the young woman’s
appeal for mercy on her assailant’s behalf. She had glimpsed something she hadn’t believed existed, something she
had long ago stopped fantasizing about: forgiveness. A calmness enveloped her.</P>
<P>She took a deep breath, allowing her body to relax. Why did this feel so right? The need to protect this young
woman was almost instinctive. She watched over Danielle for a long time, until, at last, she too fell asleep.</P>
