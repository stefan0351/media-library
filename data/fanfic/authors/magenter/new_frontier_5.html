<!-- New Frontier \ Part 5 -->

<p>Janeway sat in her office, rubbing her temples. Seven had spent the night with B'Elanna. Tom had spent the night getting drunk on the holodeck. Harry had tried to console him, but all he got for his trouble was a black eye. Harry refused to press charges, but Janeway though it best that Tom clean Harry's room for a month and clean out the air filters her room for just as long. That seemed like suitable punishment.</p>

		<p>"You wanted to see me, Captain?" Seven asked as she stood in front of Janeway's desk. She hadn't bothered to ask for entry, she just came in like she owned the place.</p>

		<p>"Yes, Seven. Are you sure you didn't know anything about those aliens yesterday?"</p>

		<p>"I know the original creators of their ship design and the different characteristics of the weapons and who they were created by, but I do not know of the aliens. All the evidence is contradicting. The weapons indicate the design of the Gundari, the shields of the Bacchi and Artims, and the hull is made from a..."</p>

		<p>"All of that is in your report, yes. But who are they?"</p>

		<p>"It is difficult to know without seeing their faces, Kathryn. Do you have a headache?"</p>

		<p>"Yes. I just need caffeine."</p>

		<p>"That is probably aggravating it and your stomach. I will get you some tea."</p>

		<p>Seven moved to the replicator and programmed some chamomile tea with milk and handed it to the captain.</p>

		<p>"How do you deal with me?"</p>

		<p>"You are my friend. I make allowances," Seven said with a slight grin. "Did you sleep last night?"</p>

		<p>"A little. I can't sleep right now."</p>

		<p>"Is there a problem? Perhaps Tuvok can show you some meditation and relaxation techniques. A warm bath?"</p>

		<p>"I tried all of that. I don't have the time to sleep. Something about those pirates is bothering me. I can't put a finger on it."</p>

		<p>"Because you are tired. I feel wonderful this morning."</p>

		<p>"From the woman who probably didn't get any sleep last night."</p>

		<p>"I slept very well last night."</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna wear you out?"</p>

		<p>Seven quirked an eyebrow and then squinted. "If you are referring to the fact that I spent the night at her place, she did not wear me out. I was merely comfortable in her embrace. Kathryn, I hope some day that you find someone to make you feel the way B'Elanna makes me feel."</p>

		<p>"Borg endurance. I'm sorry, it wasn't any of my business."</p>

		<p>"I can no longer come to you if I have a question?"</p>

		<p>"You can come to me, Seven, anytime. You just don't have to tell me about your sexual experiences, if you don't want. I'm not sure that B'Elanna would appreciate it."</p>

		<p>"We did not copulate last night. B'Elanna wishes for us to wait until we know each other better."</p>

		<p>"That's smart of her."</p>

		<p>"She is very caring."</p>

		<p>"I'm sure."</p>

		<p>"You changed the topic."</p>

		<p>"Huh?" Janeway asked, perfectly aware that she did turn the conversation away from her.</p>

		<p>"We were talking about you getting some sleep."</p>

		<p>"Oh, I can't right now."</p>

		<p>"You will."</p>

		<p>"I have reports."</p>

		<p>"That can be done tomorrow." Seven tapped her commbadge. "Seven to Chakotay."</p>

		<p>"Go ahead, Seven."</p>

		<p>"The captain will be taking the rest of the day off. Please cover the bridge."</p>

		<p>"Aye aye, Admiral," he joked.</p>

		<p>"Thank you."</p>

		<p>Seven tugged on the captain's hand and led her out onto the bridge, with everyone staring of course, and then to the turbolift and her quarters.</p>

		<p>"They must thin we're strange or something," Kathryn said as she settled in on her couch.</p>

		<p>"Then let them. It's none of their business." Seven pulled off Janeway's boots and tunic. "It is my turn to take care of you."</p>

		<p>"How is that shield thing we discussed last night?"</p>

		<p>"The opaque shielding? B'Elanna and I were installing the second emitter when you called."</p>

		<p>"You should get back."</p>

		<p>"I will, in a minute."</p>

		<p>Seven pulled Janeway up once more and dragged her to her bedroom. There, she ordered Janeway to strip down and get into the bed.</p>

		<p>"I am not a child, you know," Janeway grumbled and then promptly yawned.</p>

		<p>"I know, Kathryn. Sleep. I will wake you for dinner after my shift is finished."</p>

		<p>"Fine," Janeway yawned again.</p>

		<p>Seven tucked her in and left the captain's quarters. Within a few moments, she was back with B'Elanna on the deflector grid.</p>

		<p>"What took you so long?" B'Elanna asked, a little frustrated with the emitter she was working on. It just wouldn't fit.</p>

		<p>Seven played with her tricorder and then slapped the emitter into place.</p>

		<p>"The captain was too tired to continue working. I put her to bed."</p>

		<p>"You put the captain to bed? How did you do that? She's more stubborn than I am."</p>

		<p>"I gave her two choices, she go willingly or I sling her over my shoulder and carry her down to her quarters. She chose the logical path."</p>

		<p>"I assume that she did."</p>

		<p>"She knew that I spent the night in your quarters."</p>

		<p>"Checking up on you, huh?"</p>

		<p>"I do not know if it was that she was checking up on me or the fact that Mr. Paris was checking up on you and got into a brawl with Mr. Kim last night after learning where I slept. People do a lot of assuming on this ship."</p>

		<p>"Does she think that we did it?"</p>

		<p>"She did at first. I told her otherwise and she thought you were very smart about wanting to wait."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna chuckled. "Is she going to know everything that we do?"</p>

		<p>"She is the captain and my friend. It is my understanding that she will always have an inkling of what is going on in the confines of this hull. Do you think not?</p>

		<p>B'Elanna sat up and took Seven's hands in hers. "I know you are really close to her, Seven, and I'm glad that you are. A girl can't have too many friends. She just doesn't need to know every single thing that we do."</p>

		<p>"I understand but I will not lie if she asks me a question."</p>

		<p>"And that's one of the reasons why I love you."</p>

		<p>Seven smiled and blushed a little.</p>

		<p>"You are so cute when you blush," B'Elanna said with a wide smile as she moved onto the next emitter. Seven followed and gave her a pat on the butt before she sat down. "Hey! Did I say you could touch me there? No. So don't, okay? I'm getting involved with a horny Borg who has more endurance than a Vulcan. Geez. What am I going to do with you?"</p>

		<p>"You are being facetious."</p>

		<p>"No, I'm not."</p>

		<p>"Then I will tell you what you can do with me."</p>

		<p>"Oh you will, will you? And what, pray tell, would that be?"</p>

		<p>Seven leaned into her ear and whispered what exactly, in precise terms, B'Elanna could do to her, leaving B'Elanna all hot and bothered in the process despite the technical language.</p>

		<p>"Where did you learn all of that?"</p>

		<p>"In the database."</p>

		<p>"How long have you been doing your homework?"</p>

		<p>"Remember when I was studying you and Mr. Paris?"</p>

		<p>"Yes."</p>

		<p>"Since two weeks before then."</p>

		<p>"Kahless."</p>

		<p>"Kahless can't help you now, bangwI."</p>

		<p>"You know Klingon, too?"</p>

		<p>"Just the terms of endearment. Do you wish for me to learn more?"</p>

		<p>"You probably already know more than I do. I grew up on a human colony."</p>

		<p>"Oh." Seven leaning in close again and kissed B'Elanna's ear. She pulled the lobe into her mouth and began to suck, causing the half-Klingon's breath to catch.</p>

		<p>"Someone could walk in on us and we're working, Seven," B'Elanna said in choppy language.</p>

		<p>"Do you wish to wait?" Seven replied, now holding B'Elanna's breast and caressing her stiff nipple through the thin t-shirt.</p>

		<p>"We should," B'Elanna gasped. She pushed Seven's hand away. "We still have four more emitters to go and then we have to test them."</p>

		<p>"We could get some help."</p>

		<p>"Then I wouldn't be able to flirt with you."</p>

		<p>"You confuse me. You do not wish to engage in >making out' while on duty, but you want to flirt, which will be very difficult on me."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna grinned, showing all the teeth in her mouth that she could. "That's right."</p>

		<p>"You are impossible."</p>

		<p>"I know."</p>

		<p>Seven groaned and went to work on the next emitter. The job being more busy work than real work, was done in no time. They tested it, shook the ship around a little, and found that it worked just fine. Neither one could think of anything else to do regarding the project, so they returned to B'Elanna's cabin.</p>

		<p>"I have to make sure that the captain eats her supper," Seven said, a small pout forming on her lips.</p>

		<p>"What about my supper?" B'Elanna teased, nipping at Seven's neck.</p>

		<p>"I will not be long."</p>

		<p>"Seven kissed the shorter woman's forehead and turned to leave. B'Elanna caught her by the arm before she was out the door. Suddenly, the half-Klingon was at a loss for words. She gave a small smile, kissed Seven very hard and left her knees to buckle outside her cabin.</p>
