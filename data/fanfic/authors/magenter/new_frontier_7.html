<!-- New Frontier \ Part 7 -->

<p>Captain Janeway groaned as she sat back on her couch, a closed poetry book in her hands. Her door chimed.</p>

		<p>"Come in," she said, trying to adjust her voice to not reflect her less than happy mood.</p>

		<p>Ensign Nicole Lang stepped in cautiously and stood at attention just inside the door.</p>

		<p>"Ensign Lang," Janeway said, a little shocked. "What brings you this way?"</p>

		<p>"Ma'am, we have additional sensor readings on the ship we encountered." She held out a data padd, still standing at attention.</p>

		<p>"Thank you, Ensign, but that was hardly necessary. You could have given them to Commander Chakotay or to me in the morning. You didn't need to come all the way here."</p>

		<p>"I was just coming off my shift and decided to take the long walk home. Do you mind?"</p>

		<p>"Not in the least. Would you like to tell me about the report? Have a drink or something?"</p>

		<p>"I don't want to intrude."</p>

		<p>"You won't be. I invited you, didn't I?"</p>

		<p>"Yes," she said with a wide smile.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"You are so teasing me right now," B'Elanna said deep in her throat.</p>

		<p>"Is that a bad thing?" Seven asked, continuing the behavior that was teasing B'Elanna.</p>

		<p>"Right now, yes. I am so hungry!" Lanna said before she pounced on the slice of pepperoni in Seven's hand. She snatched it away and gobbled it up before Seven could even react. They were sitting in bed, eating the dinner that they had ignored before.</p>

		<p>"Now, I know you are. You'd think that you'd be hungry for me," Seven said, a fake pout on her lips.</p>

		<p>"I am hungry for you, baby. But I have to keep up my strength."</p>

		<p>"I haven't even had the chance to make you lose it yet," Seven continued.</p>

		<p>"I haven't given you a chance to make me use up my strength."</p>

		<p>Seven put their dinner aside on the night table and rolled back into Seven's embrace. She kissed B'Elanna's nose and pushed her shoulders to the bed.</p>

		<p>"You're gonna be that way about it," Lanna joked. "I see."</p>

		<p>"Be quiet."</p>

		<p>Seven brushed their noses against one another, her lips hovering above B'Elanna's in an erotic dance. B'Elanna purred lightly ran her nails up and down Seven's straight back. Seven finally kissed her, sucking her tongue into her mouth and whirling her own around it. In one movement, she opened B'Elanna's legs and fell between them. Lanna put her legs around her lover's hips and pulled her even closer.</p>

		<p>"You don't know what you do to me," Lanna said as Seven released her mouth in order to kiss down to her breasts.</p>

		<p>"I can feel what I do to you," Seven said seriously before she pounced on a pert nipple with her full lips and ecstatic tongue.</p>

		<p>Lanna moaned and gripped Seven's head to her chest. Seven smiled a little more and put her right hand between Lanna's legs. She fondled her slick nether lips and elicited another moan from her lover. She went further and established a rhythm against the ridge she found.</p>

		<p>"I love you," Seven whispered as Lanna's breath caught. The half-Klingon's short nails dug into Seven's shoulders.</p>

		<p>"Inside, Seven, please, inside."</p>

		<p>Seven complied with a kiss. She put her first two fingers inside of B'Elanna and began pumping them slowly, caressing her clitoris as she did so.</p>

		<p>"Oh, God! Kahless!" Lanna screamed into the night as her vagina gripped onto Seven's fingers and her body became rigid with orgasm. She then began to shake violently.</p>

		<p>Seven soothed her through it, cooing in her ear words of love and slowly caressing her with her hand. She soon learned to stop her hand completely, but left it in its warm cocoon. B'Elanna wouldn't let it go.</p>

		<p>It took B'Elanna a good five minutes to gain lucidity and release Seven's hand. Seven eased it out and pulled her lover close to her body. B'Elanna couldn't believe that she had just passed out. She had never passed out before. Certainly Seven hadn't done anything that out of the ordinary. Tom had done the same, more or less, and she was always left less than satisfied. What had Seven done differently?</p>

		<p>"I so love you," Seven said to B'Elanna, tracing her ridges with her fingers.</p>

		<p>>That's why,' B'Elanna said.</p>

		<p>"What are you thinking about?"</p>

		<p>"About how perfect you are and how much I love you."</p>

		<p>"I am not perfect."</p>

		<p>"Pretty damn close."</p>

		<p>"How much do you love me?"</p>

		<p>"More than there are stars in all the universes in all of space."</p>

		<p>"That is a considerable amount."</p>

		<p>"It is true," B'Elanna said. She took Seven's hand in hers and kissed each fingertip and then the palm.</p>

		<hr></hr>

		<p>"Are you sure about that, Nicole?" Janeway asked, her eyes firmly on Ensign Lang's face.</p>

		<p>"Yes," Lang answered seriously.</p>

		<p>"I can't believe it. I'm having a tough time trying to wrap my brain around it."</p>

		<p>"It's not something that many people understand."</p>

		<p>"But you do?"</p>

		<p>"Of course. I'm quite learned on the subject. I grew up with it, of course."</p>

		<p>"You mean to tell me that, within context..."</p>

		<p>"Yes."</p>

		<p>"Let me finish."</p>

		<p>"Sorry."</p>

		<p>"Within the context of the story, Dorothy actually went to Oz!"</p>

		<p>"Yes."</p>

		<p>"I always thought it was just a dream," Janeway said before taking another sip of wine.</p>

		<p>"See, people often think it's just a dream but people often don't remember their dreams that well. It was clearly an alternate universe. The imagery was too complete. Of course, the characters did act odd, but so did the people in the black and white world. What about the mirror universe that Benjamin Sisko spoke of before we left Deep Space Nine? It clearly is possible."</p>

		<p>"But it is only a story, once you get down to it, and it could only be written that way."</p>

		<p>"It still is very real to Dorothy, and thus cannot be a dream. It was her experience and not Auntie Em's or anybody else."</p>

		<p>"Okay," Janeway growled. "You've convinced me."</p>

		<p>Nicole laughed, snorting slightly and then covered her mouth as she realized that she snorted. Janeway laughed at her and patted her hand. That caused her to snort again and Janeway nearly fell on the floor.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry," she said as she tried to compose herself. "That was so cute. My sister does that when she's drunk."</p>

		<p>"Unfortunately, so do I. I hope I'm able to stumble home."</p>

		<p>They started to laugh again, Nicole's head falling into Janeway's lap as she slapped her knee lightly.</p>

		<p>"I haven't had so much fun in years."</p>

		<p>"Me neither," Nicole said as she wiped the tears from her eyes. She sat up and tried to compose herself, only to find when her eyes met Janeway's again, she was busting up again and so was Janeway.</p>
