		"Ensign Lang, get them out of the way," the Doctor ordered. Before Kathryn and B'Elanna had the chance to let go, the Doctor had lifted Seven and put her on the biobed nearest the door. He scanned her one more time to make sure.</p>

		<p>"What is it, Doctor?" Nicole asked. The other two women were in no shape to talk. They were too shocked.</p>

		<p>"Her nanoprobes are fixing the damage," he said in a low voice so the others wouldn't overhear.</p>

		<p>"Is there anything you can do?"</p>

		<p>"Get me a shot of triox compound. We need to keep her blood oxygenated."</p>

		<p>Nicole got a hyprospray and programmed it. She pressed it to Seven's neck and let the fluid go. Seven's body spasmed and she arched high off the bed.</p>

		<p>"What's happening?" B'Elanna asked.</p>

		<p>"I don't know," the Doctor said honestly.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna!" Seven screamed without her eyes opening.</p>

		<p>"I'm here, Seven," B'Elanna said as she pushed Nicole aside and stroked Seven's forehead. "Hang on, baby."</p>

		<p>"So dark," Seven breathed. "So cold."</p>

		<p>"Heart rate returning to normal. Nanoprobes on line. Cortical implant on line."</p>

		<p>"Seven, it's okay."</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna, I love you."</p>

		<p>"I love you, too."</p>

		<p>"Kahless," Seven whispered before she passed out.</p>

		<p>"What happened? Where'd she go?"</p>

		<p>"She's asleep. Her nanoprobes made her unconscious so that she wouldn't waste energy," the Doctor said. "All we can do now is wait."</p>

		<p>Kathryn ran over to B'Elanna and hugged her tight.</p>

		<p>"She's gonna be okay," she repeated over and over again.</p>

		<p>"Spike, come here," B'Elanna said and Naomi ran into her arms.</p>

		<p>"Seven," she whimpered and squeezed B'Elanna's neck tight.</p>

		<p>"Lt. Torres," the Doctor began. "Take Naomi home to her mother."</p>

		<p>"I wanna stay!" they both cried together.</p>

		<p>"Take her to her mom, take a fresh breath of air and come back when you're calm. That goes for you, too, Captain. Nicole and I will keep an eye on her."</p>

		<p>Kathryn gave a stiff nod and led B'Elanna and Naomi out of the room.</p>

		"Report," the captain said as she appeared on the bridge.</p>

		<p>"The Delta Flyer was destroyed," Chakotay reported somberly. "Tom is dead."</p>

		<p>She nodded as her eyebrows furrowed.</p>

		<p>"How's Seven?"</p>

		<p>"She died for a minute but her nanoprobes re-animated her. She was talking for a minute."</p>

		<p>"Thank God," Harry said.</p>

		<p>"I'll be in my ready room," Kathryn said.</p>

		<p>She walked without purpose there, looking forlorn. Chakotay followed her, leaving the bridge in Harry's hands.</p>

		<p>"You want to talk about it?" he asked as he sat down. He wasn't invited and the look on Kathryn's face showed it, but she quickly softened and melted into tears.</p>

		<p>"Don't you dare tell anybody about this," she said through her sobs.</p>

		<p>"I won't he said as he held her hand."</p>

		<p>"I didn't want to kill him," she said. "But he wouldn't stop."</p>

		<p>"You did what you had to do."</p>

		<p>"He almost killed her, Chakotay. He almost killed my daughter because he was jealous."</p>

		<p>"Your daughter?"</p>

		<p>"Sorry."</p>

		<p>"No, I understand, Kathryn. You feel like her mother. You are the only mother she knows." Chakotay went around the desk and pulled her into a hug.</p>

		<p>"Why can't it be like it was before? Why did Tom have to act like that?"</p>

		<p>"I don't know."</p>

		<p>Chakotay rocked her back and forth, saying soothing words into her hair. He knew that he didn't have anything to give her but this. This was the only way to show her that he loved her. He knew, on some level, that she was with somebody else and it had already been determined that she didn't love him in the way that he loved her.</p>

		B'Elanna practically ran Naomi home and when Samantha Wildman opened the door, she took the little girl into her arms and held her tight.</p>

		<p>"I was so worried, Naomi. I was so worried. Why didn't you call?"</p>

		<p>"You were probably busy and the Doctor needed my help," Naomi said, pouting. "I wanna go back and see Seven."</p>

		<p>"It's nearly two o'clock in the morning. You need to go to bed, Spike. I'll look after Seven for you," B'Elanna said.</p>

		<p>"How is she?"</p>

		<p>"She's alive," B'Elanna said, tears filling her eyes.</p>

		<p>"I'll be thinking of her. Tell her to get well for me," Sam said before she took Naomi to bed.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna nodded and walked slowly back to the sickbay. She didn't want to return to a dead body again.</p>

		<p>"God, Kahless," she whispered, "whoever's listening, please take care of her. She has so much more life to live and I need more time to love her. I prefer that she be there when I love her and not in Stovokor or heaven or where or anywhere but here. Please, I know I'm being selfish, but I'm so in love with her and I need her with me and happy and healthy. I'll talk care of her."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna closed her eyes during the turbolift and repeated her mantra under her breath, unmindful of anyone else who might be in the elevator. The only other person there was Neelix, and he was quiet. He wanted to give B'Elanna her space. It wouldn't do keep her when she needed to see Seven for herself.</p>

		<p>Neelix quietly followed B'Elanna off the turbolift on deck 5 and into the sickbay. He asked Nicole if he could help at all and she said that he could help the Doctor if he needed anything while she went after the captain. He nodded slightly and followed her with his eyes out of the doors.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, the Doctor continued to scan Seven, amazed at her recovery. B'Elanna flew to Seven's side and held her human hand and stroked her hair.</p>

		<p>"How is she?"</p>

		<p>"She's amazing," the Doctor said, not able to say anything else.</p>

		<p>"Her nanoprobes?"</p>

		<p>"Taken over."</p>

		<p>"Can I stay?"</p>

		<p>"Yes, but you must rest. You've been up for a long time, B'Elanna. You need your rest, too."</p>

		<p>"I understand."</p>

		<p>"Mr. Neelix, bring that biobed over here," the Doc said. Neelix moved quickly and quietly to the side of Seven's biobed. He made it up with a pillow and a non-standard blanket they had used for him when he was staying in the sickbay. B'Elanna climbed up on the bed and laid on her side, holding Seven's hand. Neelix and the Doctor covered them with the blanket and then dimmed the lights.</p>

		<p>"I think it would be best if you went home, Neelix. There's nothing else that you can do here. I don't think there's anything I can do here. Bring some banana pancakes tomorrow morning, though."</p>

		<p>"I was thinking the same thing," Neelix said. "Are they going to be okay?"</p>

		<p>"I think that Seven's health directly influences B'Elanna's. I think Seven's going to be okay."</p>

		<p>

		Nicole walked into the captain's ready room without asking for entrance. Seven was the only other one who dared do that, and God knows how close those two were. She didn't see Seven there, she saw Chakotay there, holding Kathryn as she cried.</p>

		<p>Chakotay nodded at Nicole and backed away so that she could take over.</p>

		<p>"Take her home," he mouthed to her.</p>

		<p>Nicole nodded, typed in a few commands to the captain's computer, put her arms around the tiny woman and beamed over to the captain's quarters.</p>

		<p>"She's going to be alright, Kathryn," Nicole whispered as she started to disrobe Kathryn.</p>

		<p>"Are you sure?" Kathryn asked as she looked up at Nicole.</p>

		<p>"She's sleeping now. B'Elanna's with her."</p>

		<p>"Good. I'll give her the day off tomorrow."</p>

		<p>"You're going to have the day off tomorrow, too."</p>

		<p>"Is that an order, Ensign?"</p>

		<p>"It was implied by the commander."</p>

		<p>Nicole bent down and took off the captain's shoes, socks and pants. She then dressed her in a nightgown. She lead her to the head of the bed and laid her down.</p>

		<p>"Sleep with me tonight," Kathryn asked quietly as she looked in Nicole's eyes.</p>

		<p>Nicole just quirked up a corner of her mouth and started to take off her clothes. She left her t-shirt and Starfleet issue grew boxer shorts. She laid back and let Kathryn wrap around her.</p>

		<p>The strong captain cried more in Nicole's arms as the young ensign stroked her hair and listened to her. Eventually, Kathryn cried herself to sleep while Nicole watched over her.</p>
