<!-- New Frontier \ Part 4 -->

<p>B'Elanna worked at a fevered pitch, trying to get everything repaired and in order, even though there wasn't a whole lot to repair. Mostly it was the deflector and the shields and a weakening in the hull on deck 15. Still, she worked hard, trying to forget that she had just kissed Seven, told her that she loved her and got caught by the entire bridge crew, not to mention slightly reprimanded by Captain Janeway.</p>

		<p>"Why did I tell her that?" she muttered to herself over and over again, trying not to be heard.</p>

		<p>"Excuse me?" Vorik asked, passing by.</p>

		<p>"Nothing."</p>

		<p>"You clearly asked a question, Lieutenant. Maybe I can help you."</p>

		<p>"I doubt it, Vorik. It's not a question for you to peruse with your Vulcan logic. It's rather personal... and emotional."</p>

		<p>He nodded at this last fact and walked away. B'Elanna knew that both he and Tuvok neither liked anything emotional, especially when they came for emotional species.</p>

		<p>"Damn!" B'Elanna said as she hit her head on the roof of the Jefferies tube she was shimmying out of.</p>

		<p>"Can I help you, Lieutenant?" came the reply.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna cupped the forming knot on the back of her head and turned around to see Seven standing where Vorik once stood, in the access terminal of the Jefferies tub. She looked at B'Elanna like nothing had happened. She didn't look distracted at all.</p>

		<p>"I'm fine, Seven."</p>

		<p>"You are forming a bump on the back of our head. The doctor should look at that. "I'll see him in a minute."</p>

		<p>"We need to talk, B'Elanna. May I meet you in your quarters tonight?"</p>

		<p>"Yes. I'd like that. Meet me after the meeting."</p>

		<p>"I will do that."</p>

		<p>Seven nodded and walked out. She couldn't do much else. B'Elanna deposited her tools in the proper place, logged off of work after giving her orders to Vorik. She went to the doctor, feigned clumsiness, and got her bruise fixed after getting a lecture from the doctor. She shook it off and made her way to the conference room where she was the last to arrive.</p>

		<p>"How are the repairs coming, B'Elanna?" Janeway asked first.</p>

		<p>"Fine. The deflector is repaired and weaknesses throughout the hull should be repaired by morning. The beta and gamma shifts should be able to take care of that."</p>

		<p>"Fine," Janeway said with a nod. "Any idea who these aliens are, Seven?"</p>

		<p>"All evidence indicates that they are no more than pirates in this sector. The sensor logs indicate they had a grouping of weapons and shield systems from various cultures."</p>

		<p>"Should we be concerned?"</p>

		<p>"I do not know," Seven said. It wasn't often that she said those four words in succession, but when she did say it, she meant that the Borg haven't heard of the presence. "If further evidence of activity from a unified force of pirates occur and we do experience another attack in a similar manner, we should be concerned. However, I suggest that we increase the shields around the deflector dish. Their attack seemed to be centered on that point."</p>

		<p>"Is there some way we can disguise the deflector in case of another attack?"</p>

		<p>"Under the ship, there is a star viewing bay that not many people are aware of," B'Elanna began. "The hull can be transparent and opaque with the flip of a switch. Perhaps we can use the same technology to hide the deflector."</p>

		<p>"Get working on it tomorrow morning, Lieutenant. Neelix, do you have anything to add?"</p>

		<p>"No, ma'am. I have not encountered this species or type of ship before."</p>

		<p>"Thank you all. You are dismissed."</p>

		<p>Tom caught Seven by the arm on the way out. "I saw what you were doing to my wife. You will stop, you Borg bitch."</p>

		<p>"She is no longer your wife and you do remember the agreement we had two nights ago?" Seven asked, keeping the tone in her voice casual. He continued to stare at her. "If you continue to hold my arm like that, I will be forced to make the same deal concerning me."</p>

		<p>She glared at him and he let go. He did not stop staring at her,, however, in a weakly menacing glare, but Seven dismissed him out of hand and went to the turbolift. B'Elanna was aboard, but so was Chakotay. He smiled at the sight of her.</p>

		<p>"Are there going to be any shows for me today?" he asked.</p>

		<p>"I do not know what you are talking about, Commander," Seven said in a playful voice with a quirk of her eyebrow. B'Elanna looked mortified while Chakotay chuckled.</p>

		<p>When the doors opened up, Seven walked out and B'Elanna followed.</p>

		<p>"Were you joking with Chakotay?" B'Elanna asked as they made their way to her quarters.</p>

		<p>"Yes. Was it not appreciated?"</p>

		<p>"It's okay. You just seem to be a little different these days.</p>

		<p>"I am the same person. Maybe your perception has changed."</p>

		<p>"Maybe."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna opened the doors to her quarters and stepped inside. Seven followed and stood just inside the door.</p>

		<p>"Would you like something to drink?" B'Elanna asked. "Oh, of course, you do not require..."</p>

		<p>"I would very much like a glass of wine."</p>

		<p>"What kind?"</p>

		<p>"Whichever you prefer. The captain usually chooses for me."</p>

		<p>"Do you have a preference?"</p>

		<p>"I enjoy Merlot."</p>

		<p>"Then Merlot it is."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna replicated two glasses of deep red wine and handed one to Seven. She kicked off her shoes and sat on the couch.</p>

		<p>"Sit down, stay a while," she said.</p>

		<p>Seven complied and sat down a respectful distance from B'Elanna. The half-Klingon could still feel the heat radiating off the young woman.</p>

		<p>"You can take off your shoes, if you like."</p>

		<p>"They are attached to the rest of my suit. It would be impossible to remove them without removing all of my clothing," Seven said honestly. B'Elanna's eyes opened wide. >That would be nice,' she thought. "Unless, that is what you wish me to do."</p>

		<p>"I think we would both be distracted if you did that."</p>

		<p>"I agree. Did you mean it when you said that you loved me?"</p>

		<p>"You don't pull any punches, do you?"</p>

		<p>"If you mean that I do not engage in small talk, that is correct. It is sometimes futile, especially when we are here to discuss what happened on the turbolift earlier."</p>

		<p>"Oh."</p>

		<p>"I don't know," B'Elanna said, rubbing her forehead. "I mean, I'm starting to have feelings for you and I can't really explain them. They are pleasant feelings, but I am very confused by them. I just divorced my husband and that pain is still very new. I don't want to be hurt again."</p>

		<p>"I do not want to be hurt, period, but Kathryn assured me that you cannot avoid pain sometimes, especially when some good can come of it."</p>

		<p>"I'm the one that you have a crush on, right?"</p>

		<p>"It is not a crush, B'Elanna."</p>

		<p>"Then what is it?"</p>

		<p>"I love you," she said quietly, but blatantly. "I do not expect you to return my feelings, but I would like you to be honest with me. If you do not love me, then I will not waste your time with platitudes and my romantic feelings towards you. I am not important."</p>

		<p>"Don't ever say that again, Seven," B'Elanna said as she cupped the blonde's face. "You are very important, to the ship and to me."</p>

		<p>"But you do not love me."</p>

		<p>"I love how you have treated me the past couple of days. You have not been harsh to me at all, nor have you forced me to do anything I didn't want to do. I love it when you call me B'Elanna and not lieutenant. You never whine..."</p>

		<p>"But you do not love me," Seven repeated.</p>

		<p>"You're not listening. I think I do love you."</p>

		<p>Tears flowed down Seven's face at the sound of those words. No one had ever told her that before, at least that she could remember.</p>

		<p>"Don't cry, Seven," B'Elanna said, her own tears forming anew as she wiped away Seven's with her thumbs.</p>

		<p>"I am very happy that you love me."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna smiled softly and kissed Seven very tenderly on the lips.</p>

		<p>"Good, stay that way."</p>

		<p>"I wish for you to be happy, too."</p>

		<p>"I am, with you. I feel very safe with you, and loved."</p>

		<p>"I am glad. What do we do now?"</p>

		<p>"I'll fix some dinner. I don't know about you, but I'm hungry."</p>

		<p>"You do not wish to make love?"</p>

		<p>"More than anything," B'Elanna said, feeling the heat in her groin increase. "But we should eat and I think that I would really enjoy just holding you tonight. Let's get used to each other and get to know each other a little better before we do that."</p>

		<p>"Are you scared?"</p>

		<p>"A little. Are you?"</p>

		<p>"Very."</p>

		<p>"I think a little fright is okay. I don't want to hurt you, Seven. That's what frightens me. Wouldn't this be your first time?"</p>

		<p>"Yes. I was waiting for you."</p>

		<p>"You shouldn't have waited for me. I might not even be all that good. I never have been with a woman before."</p>

		<p>"Neither have I. We will just have to learn as we go," Seven said with a small smile.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna returned the smile and kissed her lightly on the lips. "I want it to be special for you, baby. I don't want it to be rushed. We have to go back to work tomorrow morning."</p>

		<p>"We have the next day off."</p>

		<p>"Yes, we do."</p>

		<p>"Do you think of me as a baby?"</p>

		<p>"It's a term of endearment. I think of you as my baby. I want to take care of you."</p>

		<p>"You already do, Lanna, you already do."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna smiled wildly and wondered how could she ever be so lucky to get a girl like Seven. Hell, to get anyone like Seven would be a miracle. She was a genius and shaped like a goddess and she loved her with her whole heart. B'Elanna could tell it but just looking in her eyes.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna set about cooking them some dinner. She programmed in a chicken and pasta dish, knowing that Seven's stomach didn't like heavy things like steak. It didn't go well with Merlot, but it would make her love happy.</p>

		<p>They took turns feeding one another on the couch, their bodies pressed up against one another and their mouths occasionally sucking on messy fingers.</p>

		<p>"I am enjoying this activity," Seven said, her forefinger in B'Elanna's mouth as the half-Klingon ran her tongue over it.</p>

		<p>"I am, too," B'Elanna said when she let the finger go.</p>

		<p>The >activity' continued for another half an hour or so, leaving them nothing much to concentrate on but each other. Once the dishes were recycled, Seven pinned B'Elanna on the couch and kissed her deeply, causing her lady loved to purr contently. Their hands traveled over the other's body, careful not to touch any hot spots, but only to massage arms and legs and backs. After an hour, they came up for air. Seven wanted to take B'Elanna to bed and ravish her until she begged her to let up, but B'Elanna wouldn't allow that. She forced them to cool their passion down, showing Seven how they could hold one another without making love and making her see that it was just as good.</p>

		<p>Morning found the two women, still on the couch, still in each other's arms, and still dressed. They had fallen into a deep sleep together like they were holding their favorite stuffed animals. It was comforting to them both. Seven had difficulties sleeping in the captain's quarters, no matter what she did.</p>
