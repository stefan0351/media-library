		"Report!" Janeway said as she strutted onto the bridge, still dressed in her civies, a white shirt and a pair of black pants. Ensign Lang was right behind her, also dressed in her civies. She moved towards Ops and patiently awaited for Harry to give her something to do. Seven was in the next car to visit the bridge and she took the science station directly behind the captain's chair.</p>

		<p>"The pirates appeared out of no where and fired," Harry said. "Luckily, we had the deflector dish hidden. Now they are firing on our shields."</p>

		<p>"Target their weapons, full phaser intensity. Fire," Janeway ordered, knowing her friend Tuvok would follow her orders to a &gt;T.' </p>

		<p>"No effect," Tuvok said dispassionately.</p>

		<p>The ship rocked as another volley of weapons hit Voyager. Janeway went down, her head hitting the floor with a deadening thump. Chakotay and Seven looked at her for only a second, knowing that they needed to get out of this situation to save her crew and then save her. She would want it that way.</p>

		<p>Nicole Lang felt differently. She left her post by Harry, not doing much in the first place beyond holding on, and ran to Janeway.</p>

		<p>"Come on, Kathryn," she muttered as she held the captain in her arms. "You can't leave me now."</p>

		<p>"Is she alive?"</p>

		<p>"Yes. Probably a concussion," Lang said, tears filling her eyes. "Harry, are transporters on line?"</p>

		<p>"No."</p>

		<p>Lang picked the captain up in her arms and carried her to the turbolift and down to sickbay. The bridge officers looked on briefly, surprised by the young ensign's dedication and the fact that she called her Kathryn.</p>

		<p>"Commander, I believe an electromagnetic pulse will short out their systems and allow us to disable their weapons," Seven said.</p>

		<p>"We would have to know their shield modulation," Tuvok said.</p>

		<p>"I have it," Harry said from his station. He sent it to Seven's station and Seven used the very deflector that they had tried to attack days before to send the EM pulse through the pirates' shields. All of their attacker's systems immediately went off line. Tuvok targeted their weapons banks and permanently disabled them. They wouldn't be able to use those specific weapons ever again.</p>

		<p>"We were successful," Seven said.</p>

		<p>"Alien ship is hailing us," Harry said.</p>

		<p>"On screen," Chakotay ordered. "Good day, sir," he said sarcastically as a face, who he assumed was male, appeared on screen. Assumed because it looked a little more butch than femme, a lot rough around the edges, and a jaw clenched to the point of veins popping out of its forehead.</p>

		<p>"Why have you disabled our ship?" he asked.</p>

		<p>"You were attacking us. You left us no choice," Seven replied, more than a little out of turn.</p>

		<p>"Seven," Chakotay warned. "She is correct, however. You left us little choice. Why did you fire on us?"</p>

		<p>"You are in our path."</p>

		<p>"Sorry, but you didn't file one with the Federation. How did we know we were on your path?"</p>

		<p>"Are. Ignorance is not excuse for breaking the law. Prepare to be boarded."</p>

		<p>"You seem to be at a disadvantage. Who are you again?"</p>

		<p>"The Ooranni, the Usantic. We have many names."</p>

		<p>"And have stolen from many cultures. Good day, sir," Chakotay said as Harry ended the comm link. "Ensign Tal, point us home, warp six."</p>

		<p>Tal Celes did exactly as she was told and they tried to put as much distance between the pirate ship and their aft shields.</p>

		In sickbay, Ensign Lang looked on while the Doctor tended to the captain. Other assistant medics from the science department scurried around applying hyposprays and dermal regenerators and bone knitters. There weren't a lot of injuries, but those there were significant.</p>

		<p>Nicole didn't see any of the activity. She focused only on Kathryn and what the Doctor was doing to make her well.</p>

		<p>"She had a punctured lung and has a concussion, but she'll come out of it in a couple of hours. I've reduced the pressure on her brain, it's up to her to wake up now."</p>

		<p>"She will," Nicole said quietly but forcefully.</p>

		<p>"Is there something I should know about, Ensign?"</p>

		<p>"No, Doctor, I feel responsible for her."</p>

		<p>"You didn't cause the accident."</p>

		<p>"I know that. I'm not saying that I did. I just want to see her well."</p>

		<p>"We all do, Ensign."</p>

		<p>"Can I stay?"</p>

		<p>"Sure, for a little while. You'll need your rest, too. It's been a long day."</p>

		<p>"I'll go home after a little bit," she said with a slight smile. She pulled up a chair next to the biobed and took hold of the captain's hand. She eventually fell asleep to the sound of her breathing and heartbeat as her head laid on Kathryn's chest.</p>

		<p>
		* * * * * </p>

		<p>
		"What a day off," B'Elanna said as she plopped down on her couch. Seven copied the motion and quickly curled up against her lover.</p>

		<p>"I agree that it has been a most stimulating day."</p>

		<p>"Any news on the captain?"</p>

		<p>"She has a concussion and should be awake soon. It seems that she is sleeping more than unconscious, however."</p>

		<p>"I heard that Nicole Lang carried her to sickbay when the transporters were down."</p>

		<p>"She did. I have a feeling that something is going on there," Seven said.</p>

		<p>"Oh, you do, do you?" B'Elanna asked with a smile.</p>

		<p>"Yes. Ensign Lang is very attractive, do you not think?"</p>

		<p>"I agree. I just never thought of the captain as a lady's woman. Then again, I never thought of myself as much of one, either."</p>

		<p>"Because you are only a Seven woman. Perhaps Kathryn is only a Nicole Lang woman."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna laughed and held Seven closer.</p>

		<p>"Take a shower with me," Seven said, less of a question, and more of an order. It was the perfect impression of Captain Janeway.</p>

		<p>"Don't do that! I like your voice much better," B'Elanna said. She stood and through Seven over her shoulder. "But I will take a shower with you," she said as she placed a gentle pat on Seven's posterior. </p>

		<p>When they reached the bathroom, B'Elanna immediately found the clasp to Seven's suit and undid it. With steady hands she pulled Seven's clothes off and threw them aside, kissing up her naked body as she stood. Seven shivered and held B'Elanna's head close to her when her lips reached her breasts.</p>

		<p>"Oh, Lanna," she moaned. "I love you so much."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna chuckled, her lips surrounding a nipple. She quickly divided herself from her clothes and turned the water on in the shower, all without breaking contact with Seven's body. B'Elanna's lips met Seven's and they kissed deeply as the shorter woman pushed the taller woman against the wall of the shower.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna massaged Seven's breasts and nibbled at her bottom lip. One of Seven's legs wrapped around B'Elanna's hip.</p>

		<p>"Please, Lanna," Seven begged.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna complied and brought her right hand down between Seven's legs. With her first two fingers she traced the blonde's crease from top to bottom, not at all surprised at the thick liquid, not water, that accumulated there. Seven gasped and B'Elanna pushed her fingers inside her ready lover. She pumped them in and out of her, eliciting a sigh and moan with each movement.</p>

		<p>It didn't take long for Seven to come. She had been ready since before the attack when they were laying in bed trying to make love earlier. She came hard, her screams echoing in the tiled bathroom. At the end of it, she was shaking and B'Elanna held her close.</p>

		<p>"You are so good to me," Seven said, a grin on her face.</p>

		<p>"I try," B'Elanna said, kissing her sweetly.</p>

		<p>Kathryn Janeway awoke with a heavy weight on her chest and a hand holding hers. Her head was throbbing and her vision was fuzzy. She was able to see well enough, however, to notice a mass of short brown hair covering the shape of a head resting on her chest. She reached up and stroked the hair, remembering how it felt from before.</p>

		<p>"Nicole," she said hoarsely.</p>

		<p>Ensign Lang woke up slowly, turning her face towards Kathryn, but not really lifting her head. She breathed in and wiped the drool from her mouth, revealing a smile afterward.</p>

		<p>"Hi," she replied, finally sitting up only to stroke Kathryn's hair.</p>

		<p>"Hi," Kathryn said. "What happened?"</p>

		<p>"You hit your head on the deck. You have a concussion. You've been out for twenty hours."</p>

		<p>"Oh, that would explain the headache. Can I have some water?"</p>

		<p>"You may," the Doc said as he appeared with tricorder in hand. "Ensign Lang."</p>

		<p>Nicole stood and walked to the replicator, ordering a glass of cool water.</p>

		<p>"You had us worried there for a while, Captain. Thanks to my amazing medical abilities, however, you are nearly healed." He pressed a hypospray to her neck, releasing a pain killer for her headache. "I know how you hate to stay in sickbay, so I'll release you to your quarters. You aren't allowed to leave until at least two days from now and you must wear this cortical monitor." He affixed the monitor to her neck behind her ear. "You must rest that entire time. Since Ensign Lang has been here the entire time and has shown a propensity for medicine. I'd like to start training her for the assistant's position left open after Mr. Paris's absence. It is because of that, and she as accepted, that she monitor your health from your quarters. I will check up on you twice, but I will trust that Nicole will be sufficient enough to take care of you for the time being. You must listen to her for I have given her specific instructions."</p>

		<p>Janeway looked from the doctor to Nicole as her eyebrows raised up her forehead. Nicole just smiled. Janeway took the water from Nicole and gulped it down.</p>

		<p>"Much better."</p>

		<p>"Do I have your promise, Captain?"</p>

		<p>"That I follow Nicole's instructions, sure. Can I have some clothes now?"</p>

		<p>Nicole handed her a pile of clothes: a t-shirt, Starfleet sweat pants, and underwear. She smiled and turned away, nearly skipping to the doc's office to finish putting together her supplies.</p>

		<p>"Oh, god," Kathryn said.</p>

		<p>"Captain, I don't know what you're getting into..."</p>

		<p>"Don't start, Doctor."</p>

		<p>"I think she can be good for you."</p>

		<p>Kathryn's eyebrows raised up her forehead and she was reminded of her headache, dissipating but still there. She went to the bathroom and changed into the clothes that Nicole had brought her. She found it difficult because her muscles were stiff. She fought hard not to cry out, but still managed to do so. Nicole burst into the room to see Kathryn undressed with one leg in her panties and one leg out. It was undignified, for sure, but Kathryn couldn't get out of it. She was nearly in tears.</p>

		<p>"Oh, Kathryn," Nicole said, rushing to her side and helping her to the side of the tub.</p>

		<p>"I can't lift my leg," she said weakly.</p>

		<p>"I've got you," Nicole said. She finished dressing Kathryn without another word. She was incredibly gentle. When she was done, she helped Kathryn back to her quarters and laid her down.</p>

		<p>"I hurt all over."</p>

		<p>"I know."</p>

		<p>Nicole took Kathryn's sweatpants off and then her bra, still keeping her shirt and panties on. She then began to massage her body, starting at her feet and moving up slowly as each muscle loosened. It wasn't sexual, but very loving, very gentle. By the time Nicole had reached Kathryn's shoulders, the captain was asleep. Nicole smiled and covered her with the sheets and blanket. She slept on the fainting couch across from the bed.</p>

		<p>
		Seven walked into engineering and stood behind B'Elanna, silently, perfectly still, until B'Elanna turned around with a start, running her face straight into Seven's bosom.</p>

		<p>"Oh, Seven, you scared me," B'Elanna said as she patted Seven's forearm.</p>

		<p>"I have that effect on people," Seven said with a slight curl to her lips.</p>

		<p>"Not much anymore. When you were Borg, yes, now not so much," B'Elanna said as she typed some commands into one of the computer stations. Seven noticed what she was doing and helped her from another console.</p>

		<p>"I still am Borg. I still scare some people."</p>

		<p>"You are only part Borg, and most of the people on this ship know that you aren't going to hurt them. Most of you is human, though."</p>

		<p>Seven looked silently to the console and worked, not wanting to respond to B'Elanna.</p>

		<p>"It still bothers you, doesn't it?"</p>

		<p>"It does," Seven replied. "Every part of my body reminds me of my life with the Borg, if you want to call it that. I am reminded of the life that I have missed, of the people that are no longer around me, my parents. I never had brothers or sisters. I could have had them if my parents had not gone out in search of the Borg."</p>

		<p>"But you would have never come aboard Voyager and met Naomi and the Captain or eat Neelix's leola root stew or play Velocity or Kadis Kot or helped as many people as you have. You would not have met me," B'Elanna said, putting her hand on top of her lover's.</p>

		<p>"I know. That is the only thing that made my time with the Borg worth it."</p>

		<p>"I can't say that we can't change the past because our dealings with the future and past have proved that theory wrong. The only thing I can say is that you should let go of you and your parents' past mistakes and live life for the moment. It took me a while to learn that, and I still have a great deal of trouble with it, but I've accepted it. It's the only way to live your life."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna gave Seven a small smile and caressed her cheek.</p>

		<p>"I love you," Seven said quietly.</p>

		<p>"I love you, too. Let's go out to dinner tonight."</p>

		<p>"Where?"</p>

		<p>"Harry programmed a new holo restaurant on the holodeck. It's a pizzeria from the 20th century. I haven't seen it yet, but I'm sure it's good. Have you ever had pizza?"</p>

		<p>"No, I have not. Naomi keeps trying to get me to eat it, but I am never hungry when we play."</p>

		<p>"Let's take her tonight. Would you like to take her?"</p>

		<p>"That would be nice," Seven replied with a huge smile.</p>

		<p>"Good. I'll pick you up at 1800 hrs. Okay?"</p>

		<p>"Okay. I must get back to Astrometrics now."</p>

		<p>"Thank you for your help."</p>

		<p>"Anything for you," Seven said quietly before she left. On her way to her post, she contacted Naomi and asked her about that evening. She became very excited and said that she would be in the Cargo Bay at fifteen minutes before 1800. Seven disagreed and told her that they would pick her up at her quarters. Naomi groaned a little, but finally acquiesced. Seven had to smile at that.</p>

		<p>
		* * * * *</p>

		<p>
		B'Elanna showed up in cargo bay 2 right on time, which was a feat in itself for her, carrying one brilliant red rose without thorns. It was meant to remind Seven how much B'Elanna loved her and how she would never hurt Seven.</p>

		<p>Seven reacted to her like every time she saw the half Klingon. Her heart beat a little faster. A smile crept up on her face. Her knees felt weak. She put her arms around B'Elanna and kissed her cheek, unmindful of the rose the love of her life carried for her.</p>

		<p>"Hi," B'Elanna said shyly.</p>

		<p>"You are blushing, B'Elanna."</p>

		<p>"You are shaking, Seven."</p>

		<p>"Why are we acting this way?"</p>

		<p>"I think it's because this is our first date."</p>

		<p>"But it is hardly our first day. We have had dinner before and made love several times over. Why do you think this is our first date?"</p>

		<p>"Our first date amongst real people. It's kind of a declaration."</p>

		<p>"Does that scare you?"</p>

		<p>"A little. I mean Tom dated other women in front of everybody while we were married. I don't want to shove it in his face. I'm not like that."</p>

		<p>"There is no need to worry, B'Elanna. Mr. Paris forfeited his right to be jealous of us. He attacked both Chakotay and the captain. He is now in the brig awaiting an investigation, trial, and most likely, a court martial."</p>

		<p>"Why wasn't I told?"</p>

		<p>"It happened very quickly, B'Elanna. I only learned of it because of a discussion with Chakotay."</p>

		<p>"Why were you talking to him?"</p>

		<p>"I submitted my departmental report to him in the captain's absence. Are you jealous?"</p>

		<p>"No, yes. I don't know. I guess that I'm jealous that you know more gossip than I do." B'Elanna smiled. Seven leaned down and kissed her chastely.</p>

		<p>"You are cute when you are jealous. But there is no need to be. You have been isolating yourself in your work and your only contact with the outside world is me. You are not talking with your contacts."</p>

		<p>"I guess I have been, but that's what tonight is about, right?"</p>

		<p>"Right. Let's go get Naomi."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna smiled and they left the cargo bay, hand in hand, headed for the Wildman quarters. Several people looked at them as they passed, but neither noticed. They were too focused on each other. When they finally got to the quarters Naomi shared with her mom, they were surprised at how they got there. Of course, they had intended to go there but they didn't consciously walk there.</p>

		<p>Seven rang the chime and Naomi appeared at the door. She ran out, ignoring her mother's wishes for her to be home by 2200 hours. B'Elanna said that they'd have her home by then and started chasing after the feisty child. Seven followed them, running as well. Finally, they reached the turbolift and stopped inside.</p>

		<p>"What's the deal, Spike? Why were you running from your mom?"</p>

		<p>"She was starting to lecture me on the importance of eating healthy," Naomi said. "Meaning, no pizza."</p>

		<p>"You're kidding me!"</p>

		<p>"No."</p>

		<p>"Pizza contains all of the major food groups, carbos, dairy, meat, vegetables. What more could she want?" B'Elanna said, teasing the little girl.</p>

		<p>"She says that it's fattening."</p>

		<p>"That's what makes it taste good," B'Elanna said, nudging her shoulder with a gentle fist.</p>

		<p>"My stomach does not handle fat well," Seven said.</p>

		<p>"It's okay. There's not a lot of fat. Just enough to make it taste good," B'Elanna said, laughing with Naomi.</p>

		<p>When the lift doors opened, they walked to the holodeck, stopping when they heard how load it was inside.</p>

		<p>"I may sit this one out," Seven said, turning around.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 11">
		<p>"Oh, no you don't," B'Elanna said, holding onto her arm with one hand and tapping in the entrance code with the other. And there it was a fifties style pizzeria complete with Potsie, Al, and the Fonz, not to mention the most heavenly smell of pizza coming from the kitchen and all around. Lanna was elated.</p>

		<p>"I think I am experiencing sensory overload," Seven said, watching Naomi run off to meet Harry who was sitting with Chakotay and Neelix in the corner booth.</p>

		<p>"You'll be fine," Lanna said, squeezing her hand. "Let's sit at that table next to the guys. They look like they're having fun."</p>

		<p>Seven sat uneasily across from B'Elanna. She twitched slightly at all of the noise and light in her face. B'Elanna noticed this and sensed that Seven wouldn't be getting used to the sensory overload any time soon.</p>

		<p>"Harry, can you decrease the volume?" B'Elanna said.</p>

		<p>"Sure." Harry nodded and fooled with the individual jukebox at their table. The volume of the program went down, but Seven's unease didn't decrease in the slightest.</p>

		<p>"Are you okay, Seven?" Chakotay asked.</p>

		<p>"I do not know," Seven said. Her eyes couldn't stay focused.</p>

		<p>"Is it the lights, Seven?" Harry asked and then immediately stopped the varying of the lights. Still, no change. Her left arm abruptly shot out and broke the table in half.</p>

		<p>"Seven, what's wrong?" B'Elanna asked as she took hold of Seven's arm so that it wouldn't hurt anybody. Her preventative action was useless since Seven's arm threw her off into a set of chairs and tables.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna, I'm sorry!" Seven screamed. "I cannot control myself." She spasmed uncontrollably while the crew was helpless looking on. B'Elanna made a run for Seven and jumped her, pushing her to the floor.</p>

		<p>"Seven, calm down," B'Elanna said calmly.</p>

		<p>"I cannot."</p>

		<p>"Kill her!" an unknown ensign called from the peanut gallery.</p>

		<p>"No!" B'Elanna screamed. She stood and threw Seven over her shoulder, putting her on the floor and hoping that would calm her. It didn't have the desired effect. The Doctor appeared out of nowhere with a hypospray. He pressed it to Seven's neck and she passed out. B'Elanna remained on top of her, now hoping that her weight would comfort her lover.</p>

		<p>"What's wrong with her?" Chakotay asked.</p>

		<p>"Well, if Lt. Torres would disembark, I could tell you."</p>

		<p>"Sorry," B'Elanna said as she rolled off, keeping hold of Seven's hand. "Go ahead."</p>

		<p>"Thank you for your permission, Lieutenant."</p>

		<p>The Doctor scanned the prone Seven of Nine with his tricorder and hmmmed and hawed. </p>

		<p>"Doctor?" Chakotay asked.</p>

		<p>"She has suffered from an electromagnetic pulse."</p>

		<p>"The same kind that we used on the pirate ship," Chakotay said quietly. "Where did it come from?"</p>

		<p>Harry went to the nearest wall console and typed in a couple of commands.</p>

		<p>"From outside the ship, Commander."</p>

		<p>"Bridge, scan for cloaked vessels," Chakotay said with a tap of his comm badge. He wasted no time in making his way to the bridge.</p>

		<p>"Cloaked ship detected. They are decloaking, sir," the ensign in control of Ops said as Chakotay appeared on the bridge.</p>

		<p>"Shields!" Chakotay ordered.</p>

		<p>"They are charging weapons," Tuvok said from his post.</p>

		<p>"Attention crew, battle stations. Charge weapons. Fire at their shield generators and weapons," Chakotay said from the captain's chair. " Engage."</p>

		<p>"No effect," Tuvok said.</p>

		<p>"Kim and Lange to the bridge. Torres to engineering."</p>

		<p>"Aye, sir," the first two said as they stepped off the turbolift.</p>

		<p>"Chakotay, I need to stay with Seven," B'Elanna said through her comm badge.</p>

		<p>"You can be of more help to her from engineering. That's an order, Lieutenant."</p>

		<p>"Aye, sir," she said before she ran off to her station.</p>

		<p>
		* * * * *</p>

		<p>
		"Doc, how's Seven?" Naomi said, sticking close to the EMH and keeping an eye on Seven just as B'Elanna had told her. B'Elanna also knew that Naomi would be the safest in the sickbay and also might be able to get supplies for the doctor.</p>

		<p>"She is stable, Miss Wildman. Please pick a corner," the Doctor said, fretting over Seven still.</p>

		<p>"I will if you tell me how she is really," Naomi said as she stood her ground.</p>

		<p>"Fine. Her systems are in a state of flux. They are not operating properly and her nanoprobes are not compensating."</p>

		<p>"That's bad," Naomi said as she stood back.</p>

		<p>"Yes. But she will be fine. She is stable for the moment." Just then, the sickbay started filling up with wounded. The Doctor set up a stool for Naomi and thrust a tricorder in her hands. "Keep an eye on her, Naomi. If she changes at all, tell me."</p>

		<p>"Yes, sir," she said.</p>

		<p>
		* * * * * </p>

		<p>Meanwhile, in engineering, all havoc was breaking loose. B'Elanna didn't have time to worry about Seven. She had too many other things to worry about. She had to find more power somewhere to power force fields around the hull breaches on the various decks. There were many of them and she had to keep the fields up for just long enough to get the decks sealed off. Fortunately, she didn't need the power for that long since the crew was very experienced at evacuating decks.</p>

		<p>"Torres, gather all available power to the engines and maneuvering thrusters."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna did as she was told. There was no time to question the commander's orders, judging from the tone in his voice. A moment later, the ship was rolling and spiraling, doing tricks that she didn't think her ship was capable of doing. When the rolling stopped, an explosion rocked the ship and they were dead in the water.</p>

		<p>
		* * * * *</p>

		<p>
		"Enemy ship destroyed," Tuvok said.</p>

		<p>"Damage?" the captain asked as she appeared on the bridge. "I may be a bit late, but I'm not going home at a time like this."</p>

		<p>"Hull breaches on decks twelve through fifteen."</p>

		<p>"Send repair crews. Casualties?"</p>

		<p>"A few wounded, no deaths," Harry reported. "Transporters off line, shields down to 33%, torpedoes off line."</p>

		<p>"At least they waited until after the fight to go down," Chakotay said as he gave up the captain's chair for her. She sat down and looked at the back of Tal Celes' head. She was happily piloting the ship and trying to get some systems on line while she did so.</p>

		<p>"Sensors?"</p>

		<p>"On line. No ships within range."</p>

		<p>"How is Seven?" Janeway finally asked.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 12">
		<p>
		"Captain, intership transport active," Nicole said from the secondary Ops station.</p>

		<p>"From where, Nicole?" Janeway asked</p>

		<p>"From the ship bay to the brig. It's Tom. He's transported to the Delta Flyer," Nicole explained. "He's started disembarking procedures."</p>

		<p>"Lock the bay doors, Tuvok," Kathryn barked.</p>

		<p>"Unable to comply. Locked out of bay controls."</p>

		<p>"Try again! I do not want him off this ship! I do not want to lose that ship!"</p>

		<p>"He did build it, Captain."</p>

		<p>"He doesn't own it, Commander," Janeway said icily.</p>

		<p>"I would think that you are more concerned about the Flyer than Mr. Paris."</p>

		<p>"I am concerned about both," Janeway said.</p>

		<p>"He's out of the bay," Harry said. "He's got control of the sickbay."</p>

		<p>"Hail him."</p>

		<p>"Responding."</p>

		<p>"Tom, you've got to stop this. You won't survive out there."</p>

		<p>"I won't survive in there."</p>

		<p>"What are you doing in sickbay?"</p>

		<p>"Getting rid of that blonde bitch."</p>

		<p>"Get a tractor on him and gain control of sickbay," she said to Chakotay. "Nicole, get down there and help the doctor out."</p>

		<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

		<p>"Yes, ma'am," Tom mocked. "Is she your bitch now?"</p>

		<p>"Tom, stop this now! I'm not above firing phasers at you."</p>

		<p>"You wouldn't destroy this ship."</p>

		<p>"I would if it would stop you. I hate to say this, Mr. Paris, but you are proving yourself an enemy of this ship. Your behavior is out of line," she said, concern touching her force ten discipline voice and stare.</p>

		<p>"It's your behavior that's out of line!" Tom barked back. "You brought that Borg on this ship and she stole my wife!"</p>

		<p>"This isn't about Seven anymore! This is about you hurting this crew and generally screwing up your entire career and life."</p>

		<p>"I don't care about that anymore."</p>

		<p>"That much is clear."</p>

		<p>"He's powering warp engines. Electric stream still active in sickbay," Tuvok said.</p>

		<p>"Lang to the bridge, he's electrocuting Seven. You've gotta stop him."</p>

		<p>"Tom, you're killing her!"</p>

		<p>"Good."</p>

		<p>"Comm link off! Power phasers, disable his systems."</p>

		<p>"Aye, Captain," Tuvok said. It took several phaser shots to disable the Delta Flyer, weapons, communications and all.</p>

		<p>"Electric stream not affected," Nicole said. "Captain, when you get a minute."</p>

		<p>"I'll be down, Nicole," Janeway said, not liking the somber tone in her voice.</p>

		<p>"Ready for impact," Chakotay said.</p>

		<p>"Fire torpedoes. Blow the fucker up," Janeway said as she exited the bridge.</p>

		<p>* * * * *</p>

		<p>
		Naomi looked on in horror as a white lightening bolt hit Seven's chest.</p>

		<p>"Seven!" she screamed.</p>

		<p>"Seven!" the Doctor screamed as he hopped on top of Seven, trying to block the bolt with his body. It didn't work. The bolt kept coming and electrocuting Seven.</p>

		<p>Nicole came at that time and shot out where the bolt was coming from with a phaser. It only made the electricity come faster and more powerfully.</p>

		<p>"Doctor, get off!"</p>

		<p>"Gotta block her," he replied with strain evident in his voice.</p>

		<p>"Naomi, go to the Doctor's office!"</p>

		<p>"I wanna stay!"</p>

		<p>"Go!"</p>

		<p>Naomi complied, but complied slowly.</p>

		<p>"Doctor, now!" She took hold of his arm and yanked him off. She then contacted the bridge and told them what was going on, trying her best to block the electricity as she did so. It was nearly impossible, but she was able to deflect some of the energy.</p>

		<p>She called the captain again and then felt an explosion from outside the ship. She knew that Tom was dead at that time. Janeway was there a second later.</p>

		<p>"No!" Janeway screamed as she saw Seven arch up and down off the bed from the electricity bolt. She ran to her side and yanked her off the table. The bolt didn't follow and Nicole was able to turn it off finally.</p>

		<p>"You can't leave me now!" Janeway said. "I'm supposed to go first! Don't do this, Seven. Annika! Please stay." Kathryn cried, unconcerned about looking weak now. She wanted to save her friend, nay, her daughter. She stroked Seven's hair as the Doctor examined her on the floor.</p>

		<p>"She's gone," the Doctor said mournfully just as B'Elanna came into the sickbay. She fell to Seven's side and held her close as Kathryn put her forehead to Seven's bare stomach.</p>

		<p>"She's not supposed to go yet," Kathryn said over and over again.</p>

		<p>"Bang'wI, stay with me. You aren't going to die on me. Come on, baby."</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna she's gone," Nicole said as she placed her hand on the Klingon's shoulder.</p>

		<p>"NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!"</p>

		<p>The two women and one little girl who loved Seven most howled, making Kahless himself both proud and jealous at the strength of their voices. It reverberated throughout the ship.</p>

		<p>The Doctor looked on helplessly, keeping one eye on the tricorder, and the other on the women. Within a second, something the tricorder said made both eyes turn to it and a puzzled look appeared on his face.</p>

		<p>
		"Ensign Lang, get them out of the way," the Doctor ordered. Before Kathryn and B'Elanna had the chance to let go, the Doctor had lifted Seven and put her on the biobed nearest the door. He scanned her one more time to make sure.</p>

		<p>"What is it, Doctor?" Nicole asked. The other two women were in no shape to talk. They were too shocked.</p>

		<p>"Her nanoprobes are fixing the damage," he said in a low voice so the others wouldn't overhear.</p>

		<p>"Is there anything you can do?"</p>

		<p>"Get me a shot of triox compound. We need to keep her blood oxygenated."</p>

		<p>Nicole got a hyprospray and programmed it. She pressed it to Seven's neck and let the fluid go. Seven's body spasmed and she arched high off the bed.</p>

		<p>"What's happening?" B'Elanna asked.</p>

		<p>"I don't know," the Doctor said honestly.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna!" Seven screamed without her eyes opening.</p>

		<p>"I'm here, Seven," B'Elanna said as she pushed Nicole aside and stroked Seven's forehead. "Hang on, baby."</p>

		<p>"So dark," Seven breathed. "So cold."</p>

		<p>"Heart rate returning to normal. Nanoprobes on line. Cortical implant on line."</p>

		<p>"Seven, it's okay."</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna, I love you."</p>

		<p>"I love you, too."</p>

		<p>"Kahless," Seven whispered before she passed out.</p>

		<p>"What happened? Where'd she go?"</p>

		<p>"She's asleep. Her nanoprobes made her unconscious so that she wouldn't waste energy," the Doctor said. "All we can do now is wait."</p>

		<p>Kathryn ran over to B'Elanna and hugged her tight.</p>

		<p>"She's gonna be okay," she repeated over and over again.</p>

		<p>"Spike, come here," B'Elanna said and Naomi ran into her arms.</p>

		<p>"Seven," she whimpered and squeezed B'Elanna's neck tight.</p>

		<p>"Lt. Torres," the Doctor began. "Take Naomi home to her mother."</p>

		<p>"I wanna stay!" they both cried together.</p>

		<p>"Take her to her mom, take a fresh breath of air and come back when you're calm. That goes for you, too, Captain. Nicole and I will keep an eye on her."</p>

		<p>Kathryn gave a stiff nod and led B'Elanna and Naomi out of the room.</p>

		<p>
		* * * * *</p>

		<p>
		"Report," the captain said as she appeared on the bridge.</p>

		<p>"The Delta Flyer was destroyed," Chakotay reported somberly. "Tom is dead."</p>

		<p>She nodded as her eyebrows furrowed.</p>

		<p>"How's Seven?"</p>

		<p>"She died for a minute but her nanoprobes re-animated her. She was talking for a minute."</p>

		<p>"Thank God," Harry said.</p>

		<p>"I'll be in my ready room," Kathryn said.</p>

		<p>She walked without purpose there, looking forlorn. Chakotay followed her, leaving the bridge in Harry's hands.</p>

		<p>"You want to talk about it?" he asked as he sat down. He wasn't invited and the look on Kathryn's face showed it, but she quickly softened and melted into tears.</p>

		<p>"Don't you dare tell anybody about this," she said through her sobs.</p>

		<p>"I won't he said as he held her hand."</p>

		<p>"I didn't want to kill him," she said. "But he wouldn't stop."</p>

		<p>"You did what you had to do."</p>

		<p>"He almost killed her, Chakotay. He almost killed my daughter because he was jealous."</p>

		<p>"Your daughter?"</p>

		<p>"Sorry."</p>

		<p>"No, I understand, Kathryn. You feel like her mother. You are the only mother she knows." Chakotay went around the desk and pulled her into a hug.</p>

		<p>"Why can't it be like it was before? Why did Tom have to act like that?"</p>

		<p>"I don't know."</p>

		<p>Chakotay rocked her back and forth, saying soothing words into her hair. He knew that he didn't have anything to give her but this. This was the only way to show her that he loved her. He knew, on some level, that she was with somebody else and it had already been determined that she didn't love him in the way that he loved her.</p>

		<p>

		<p>
		B'Elanna practically ran Naomi home and when Samantha Wildman opened the door, she took the little girl into her arms and held her tight.</p>

		<p>"I was so worried, Naomi. I was so worried. Why didn't you call?"</p>

		<p>"You were probably busy and the Doctor needed my help," Naomi said, pouting. "I wanna go back and see Seven."</p>

		<p>"It's nearly two o'clock in the morning. You need to go to bed, Spike. I'll look after Seven for you," B'Elanna said.</p>

		<p>"How is she?"</p>

		<p>"She's alive," B'Elanna said, tears filling her eyes.</p>

		<p>"I'll be thinking of her. Tell her to get well for me," Sam said before she took Naomi to bed.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna nodded and walked slowly back to the sickbay. She didn't want to return to a dead body again.</p>

		<p>"God, Kahless," she whispered, "whoever's listening, please take care of her. She has so much more life to live and I need more time to love her. I prefer that she be there when I love her and not in Stovokor or heaven or where or anywhere but here. Please, I know I'm being selfish, but I'm so in love with her and I need her with me and happy and healthy. I'll talk care of her."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna closed her eyes during the turbolift and repeated her mantra under her breath, unmindful of anyone else who might be in the elevator. The only other person there was Neelix, and he was quiet. He wanted to give B'Elanna her space. It wouldn't do keep her when she needed to see Seven for herself.</p>

		<p>Neelix quietly followed B'Elanna off the turbolift on deck 5 and into the sickbay. He asked Nicole if he could help at all and she said that he could help the Doctor if he needed anything while she went after the captain. He nodded slightly and followed her with his eyes out of the doors.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, the Doctor continued to scan Seven, amazed at her recovery. B'Elanna flew to Seven's side and held her human hand and stroked her hair.</p>

		<p>"How is she?"</p>

		<p>"She's amazing," the Doctor said, not able to say anything else.</p>

		<p>"Her nanoprobes?"</p>

		<p>"Taken over."</p>

		<p>"Can I stay?"</p>

		<p>"Yes, but you must rest. You've been up for a long time, B'Elanna. You need your rest, too."</p>

		<p>"I understand."</p>

		<p>"Mr. Neelix, bring that biobed over here," the Doc said. Neelix moved quickly and quietly to the side of Seven's biobed. He made it up with a pillow and a non-standard blanket they had used for him when he was staying in the sickbay. B'Elanna climbed up on the bed and laid on her side, holding Seven's hand. Neelix and the Doctor covered them with the blanket and then dimmed the lights.</p>

		<p>"I think it would be best if you went home, Neelix. There's nothing else that you can do here. I don't think there's anything I can do here. Bring some banana pancakes tomorrow morning, though."</p>

		<p>"I was thinking the same thing," Neelix said. "Are they going to be okay?"</p>

		<p>"I think that Seven's health directly influences B'Elanna's. I think Seven's going to be okay."</p>

		<p>
		* * * * * </p>

		<p>
		Nicole walked into the captain's ready room without asking for entrance. Seven was the only other one who dared do that, and God knows how close those two were. She didn't see Seven there, she saw Chakotay there, holding Kathryn as she cried.</p>

		<p>Chakotay nodded at Nicole and backed away so that she could take over.</p>

		<p>"Take her home," he mouthed to her.</p>

		<p>Nicole nodded, typed in a few commands to the captain's computer, put her arms around the tiny woman and beamed over to the captain's quarters.</p>

		<p>"She's going to be alright, Kathryn," Nicole whispered as she started to disrobe Kathryn.</p>

		<p>"Are you sure?" Kathryn asked as she looked up at Nicole.</p>

		<p>"She's sleeping now. B'Elanna's with her."</p>

		<p>"Good. I'll give her the day off tomorrow."</p>

		<p>"You're going to have the day off tomorrow, too."</p>

		<p>"Is that an order, Ensign?"</p>

		<p>"It was implied by the commander."</p>

		<p>Nicole bent down and took off the captain's shoes, socks and pants. She then dressed her in a nightgown. She lead her to the head of the bed and laid her down.</p>

		<p>"Sleep with me tonight," Kathryn asked quietly as she looked in Nicole's eyes.</p>

		<p>Nicole just quirked up a corner of her mouth and started to take off her clothes. She left her t-shirt and Starfleet issue grew boxer shorts. She laid back and let Kathryn wrap around her.</p>

		<p>The strong captain cried more in Nicole's arms as the young ensign stroked her hair and listened to her. Eventually, Kathryn cried herself to sleep while Nicole watched over her.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 14">
		<p>
		Kathryn woke to a softness beneath her cheek and a wonderful new scent teasing her senses.</p>

		<p>"I could get used to this," she murmured as her forefinger traced patterns on her soon to be lover's exposed stomach. "I love you," she whispered.</p>

		<p>Kathryn felt infinitely better this morning than she had the night before. No tears stained her face, they had been gently washed away by love's kisses. She felt safe, protected, solid, and human all at the same time. She kissed Nicole's covered breast and was amazed at the peak that arose in the middle. She grazed her forefinger over it, further amazed that Nicole hadn't woken up yet.</p>

		<p>"Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me," she said quietly, reciting a Stephen Foster poem. Nicole's chest rose with the first breath of morning, soothing Kathryn even more.</p>

		<p>"Good morning," Kathryn purred.</p>

		<p>"Good morning," Nicole said.</p>

		<p>"Thanks for staying last night," she said.</p>

		<p>"Back to niceties? You cried on my shoulder last night and are now caressing my breast," Nicole joked.</p>

		<p>"I believe in being polite."</p>

		<p>"Then, I have a question for you."</p>

		<p>"Okay. Go ahead, Ensign."</p>

		<p>"So cruel. May I kiss you, Captain?"</p>

		<p>"May I kiss you, Captain what?"</p>

		<p>"May I kiss you, Captain, please," Nicole said, pleading mocked in her voice.</p>

		<p>"You may."</p>

		<p>Nicole shimmied down the bed so that she was eye level with her love. She teased Janeway's lips with the tip of her tongue, not actually touching her. When Kathryn got frustrated, she reeled her tongue in and smiled. When she hesitated, Kathryn drew close and pressed her lips to Nicole's.</p>

		<p>Tongues teased lips and teeth and each other while hands held each other, grasping and releasing each other in a dance of love. Their lips released each other and they were breathing heavily and smiling.</p>

		<p>"I'm so in love with you, Kathryn."</p>

		<p>Kathryn smiled wider and kissed the young woman. "I love you, too."</p>

		<p>Nicole laughed and pushed Kathryn back to the bed. She put her mouth to the pulse point on her neck and sucked gently. Kathryn trusted her, knowing that she wouldn't give her a hickey only to be hidden or healed later.</p>

		<p>Kathryn's hands ran up and down Nicole's back just under her shirt. Her skin was so smooth, silk and satin at the same time, with strong muscles hidden just beneath.</p>

		<p>"Oh, Nikki," Kathryn groaned, already taking the liberty that only a loved one could take, shortening her name. </p>

		<p>&gt;Nikki' kissed further down her lover's body, pushing down her nightgown as she went. When Kathryn's breasts were revealed, she carefully avoided the quickly hardening tips, opting instead to kiss the fleshy mound around it. Kathryn's hips lifted into the air and Nicole took that opportunity to push the nightgown completely off.</p>

		<p>"You're suddenly overdressed," Kathryn breathed.</p>

		<p>"Let me take care of you," was all that Nicole said before she finally put her lips to Kathryn's aching nipple.</p>

		<p>Nicole made love to Kathryn softly, gently, making her call out to the stars in wild abandon. It was the most beautiful sound in the world to Nicole. After hours of being made love to, Kathryn laid back, sated. Her mind was reeling.</p>

		<p>The lovers held each other close, their breath mingling as their mouths were not more than millimeters apart. It took Kathryn another hour before she could repay the debt, complaining that Nicole was too good. She then proved to Nicole that she was just as good and wouldn't stop until Nicole pushed her away or passed out because of her passion.</p>

		<p>
		* * * * *</p>

		<p>
		Seven awoke to the pleasant smell of her lover filling her senses. She heard the double beat in her ear and her own heartbeat matched it. She was alive and so was B'Elanna. She smiled and squeezed B'Elanna close. B'Elanna moaned and smiled down at the love of her life.</p>

		<p>"You're a sight for sore eyes," Lanna said.</p>

		<p>"Are your eyes sore?"</p>

		<p>"Not anymore." B'Elanna eased Seven back onto her biobed and moved hers out of the way.</p>

		<p>"I wanted to hold onto you longer," Seven pouted.</p>

		<p>"You can hold onto me for the rest of your life," B'Elanna replied. She urged Seven to sit on the edge of the bed and then knelt down in front of her. "Seven, Annika Hansen..." she started to cry, "I love you so much, and I want to give you my love, my hearts, my soul to you for all of my days and beyond. Will you marry me?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, B'Elanna," Seven said as she slipped off the bed and put her arms around B'Elanna's neck.</p>

		<p>"Please say yes, Seven. I don't want to live without you. I can't live without you."</p>

		<p>"Yes, B'Elanna Marie Torres, I will marry you."</p>

		<p>They kissed as the Doctor looked on, crying holographic tears. All was well in the ship called Voyager.</p>
