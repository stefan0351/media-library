	<chapter title="Part 1">
		<p>Lt. B'Elanna Torres stood in the middle of the living area in her quarters, her hands on her hips and her chest heaving from heavy breathing. She was mad, pissed beyond belief even for a Klingon. It was the last time that she'd ever let her husband of only a few months Tom Paris back in her life ever again.</p>

		<p>She found them, Tom and his new chippy, pawing at each other with their tongues clearly ensconced in each other's mouths. Tom's manhood was out, stiff and raring to go. Her skirt, whoever she was B'Elanna didn't care, was up around her waist and she wore no underwear.</p>

		<p>The fact that she had found them doing that didn't piss her off so much. What pissed her off was that he had brought HER back to their quarters, originally her quarters, and was fucking her on her couch. They didn't even stop when she came in, only invited her to come along.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna calmed her breathing, an amazing feat for her temper that was neither Klingon or human at that point. She counted to three and began speaking in clear, precise terms.</p>

		<p>"Tom, please take this... woman back to her quarters. I do not care if you stay there this evening, but you will not be returning here ever. You will be gone by the time I return from talking to the Captain. You have thirty minutes to clear your things," B'Elanna said, her voice and body stance taking on the qualities stronger than Captain Janeway's force ten demeanor. Said Janeway demeanor could peel the paint off the hull. B'Elanna's new demeanor could remove the duranium from the alloy composing the outer hull.</p>

		<p>She didn't stay to see how they would respond. She merely turned on her booted heel and stomped with purpose out of her quarters to the turbolift.</p>

		<p>"Deck three," she growled. The turbolift began to move and she let go a breath that she knew she had been holding. After she had begun talking, she couldnt breath anymore, especially in his presence. Still, the new breathing was a relief because they were the new breaths of freedom.</p>

		<p>'You are too damn cheezy, girl,' she told herself. 'Freedom! Huh! Whatever. Im still stuck on this damn ship, aren't I? And I'm going to have to see him every single day for the rest of my life no matter if we are married or not.'</p>

		<p>Still, B'Elanna had to admit that it wasn't all that bad being on Voyager. She had been given a new life on this ship and a family that she could largely count on. Her dad had left when she was five and her mom tried to become more Klingon than a mother even though she was a scientist and not a warrior. The woman she was going to see now had shown her more love and respect than her mother and father ever had. She could truly call Captain Kathryn Janeway her friend, and in her private thoughts, mother. She would never tell anyone that, but it was enough that she recognized it.</p>

		<p>The turbolift doors swished open and she walked through, her hands shaking from nervousness. She wanted to scream and cry and hold onto her 'mother' for dear life, but she needed to request for a termination of the marriage before she did anything else. When she saw Janeway on the couch, that plan was shot to hell as she ran into the older woman's arms and began sobbing.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna, what's wrong?" Kathryn said soothingly as she stroked her wavy chestnut locks.</p>

		<p>"Tom," B'Elanna chortled, her sobs becoming more wracking in their power. She drooled, her nose ran, tears came from her eyes in sheets. There was no dignity in this process.</p>

		<p>"What did he do, B'Elanna?"</p>

		<p>"Fucked Jennifer."</p>

		<p>"Delaney?"</p>

		<p>"Does it matter?" she wailed.</p>

		<p>"No, I guess it doesn't."</p>

		<p>"I will leave," a cool voice came from a chair near the couch. It was Seven of Nine, the resident ex-Borg, and someone that B'Elanna only tolerated.</p>

		<p>"Maybe you should," Janeway replied. "See you tomorrow morning."</p>

		<p>"Yes, ma'am. Lt. Torres, Ensign Paris is a fool," Seven said simply, her voice softened, before she strutted out of the captain's quarters.</p>

		<p>"When did she get here?"</p>

		<p>"We had dinner and a philosophical discussion. Don't worry about her."</p>

		<p>"You think she'd tell anyone."</p>

		<p>"She won't lie but I don't think she'd seek out people to tell. She's not like that. She's got a good heart."</p>

		<p>"I used to think that she was the biggest bitch on board," B'Elanna said, her tears subsiding for a minute. "I'm not so sure anymore. When she was dying, you could really see her fear."</p>

		<p>"I know. I was very scared for her."</p>

		<p>"You scared?"</p>

		<p>"Of course. Everybody gets scared, even crotchety old captains like me."</p>

		<p>"You really love her, don't you?"</p>

		<p>"Yes."</p>

		<p>"Are you two together?"</p>

		<p>"No!" Janeway exclaimed. "I mean, she's a beautiful woman, but she's already got a crush on somebody else. I can't compete with that."</p>

		<p>"Who?"</p>

		<p>"I'll never tell, B'Elanna. She told me in the strictest confidence."</p>

		<p>"But you do love her and wouldn't mind if you were with her."</p>

		<p>"I do love her, but I think of her more as my daughter than a possible lover. She's an innocent and I want her to have somebody that can offer her her complete attention. I have the ship."</p>

		<p>"Her?"</p>

		<p>"It's a female, yes."</p>

		<p>"Sam Wildman?"</p>

		<p>"I'm not telling," Janeway said. "You certainly are a little more cheerful than when you came in here."</p>

		<p>"Yeah, gossip does that for me."</p>

		<p>"What did you want to do about Tom?"</p>

		<p>"Divorce him. Truth is that it was over before it began. I just got excited because he included me in his race. I was angry at him for not showing me any time. You know what we had? A week on the Flyer and a week aboard and then he was gone off with Harry or on the Holodeck and then with the Delaney sisters. Kahless, I should have seen it coming. I mean, he wouldn't make love to me after that second week. He must have been fucking her that long."</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna, I'm sorry."</p>

		<p>"Don't be sorry, it isn't your fault."</p>

		<p>"I should have seen it coming."</p>

		<p>"You had no idea, Captain. I barely had a clue."</p>

		<p>"Computer, what is the location of Ensign Paris?"</p>

		<p>"Ensign Paris is in Ensign Kim's quarters."</p>

		<p>"You can stay here tonight if you don't want to be alone," Janeway said. "I think you should have a good talk with Tom tomorrow, though."</p>

		<p>"I said everything that I needed to before I left."</p>

		<p>"You didn't scream at him, did you?"</p>

		<p>"No. I was actually quite calm. I told him to get out and never come back. But you know Tom, he wants everything he can't have."</p>

		<p>"I know. Do you want me to make sure he understands tomorrow morning?"</p>

		<p>"No. Just serve him with the documents. That's all. I want to wash my hands of him."</p>

		<p>"Okay. Did you want to stay here?"</p>

		<p>"I think so. I'll just sleep on the couch."</p>

		<p>"I'll get you some blankets."</p>

		<p>Janeway patted her back and stood. She got a blanket, a pillow and set of sheets from her closet, only used by Seven of Nine so far in her attempts to sleep. She'd have to sleep someplace else that night.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Seven was disturbed at B'Elanna's state when she entered the captain's quarters. It was the first time that she had ever seen B'Elanna so emotional when it didn't involve anger. She felt sad in her heart that Tom Paris would treat her that way. It was unacceptable. She would have a talk with the Ensign.</p>

		<p>Still, she was happy that B'Elanna and Tom were no longer together. They were not suited well for one another. Tom did not respect B'Elanna. He was always copulating with other females, both holographic and real, and spent more time with his toys than B'Elanna. He often ignored B'Elanna when they were in the same room, even though B'Elanna's whole attention was on him. B'Elanna would definitely be better off with out him.</p>

		<p>Seven found herself in front of Harry Kim's quarters without recognizing how she got there. She had asked the computer where Paris was, and it replied that he was there, but really didn't have any intention of talking to the man that night.</p>

		<p>She rang the chime.</p>

		<p>"Come," came Harry's reply.</p>

		<p>Seven raised an eyebrow and walked into the dimly lit quarters. She could hear ranting and raving coming from the bedroom of Harry's small quarters.</p>

		<p>"Seven, what can I do for you?"</p>

		<p>"I wish to speak with Ensign Paris."</p>

		<p>"He's not doing so well right now. Can it wait until tomorrow?"</p>

		<p>Both eyebrows went up as she considered Harry's question.</p>

		<p>"No, it cannot."</p>

		<p>"Fine, don't be surprised if he starts yelling at you."</p>

		<p>"I am a &gt;big girl.' I can handle it." Harry chuckled at that one before he called Tom into the other room.</p>

		<p>"Seven, what do you want?" Tom asked, his tone less than cordial. Seven noticed that his face was decidedly beet red and his temperature and respiration were elevated.</p>

		<p>"I wish to tell you that what you did to Lt. Torres is unacceptable and if you dare to hurt her or do anything against her wishes again, you will have to answer to me. Understand?"</p>

		<p>"And what would you do, captain's pet?"</p>

		<p>"The punishment shall fit the crime," she said as she turned on her heel and walked out of Harry's quarters.</p>

		<p>"I think you made another enemy."</p>

	<chapter title="Part 2">
		<p>The lights in the captain's quarters rose to day level at 0600, alerting B'Elanna to the beginning of the day shift. She groaned and rubbed the caked tears out of her eyes and dried snot from underneath her nose. A moment later, the lights in the living area were out again, leaving B'Elanna a little confused.</p>

		<p>"Captain?" she called out.</p>

		<p>"Go back to sleep, B'Elanna. You have the day off," Janeway said as she stood in her robe at the door of her bedroom. "I'll try to be quiet."</p>

		<p>"There's no need, Captain. I should be leaving. I've used up too much of your time."</p>

		<p>"It's no problem, B'Elanna, and if I have to order you to take the day off, I will, Lieutenant."</p>

		<p>"I wasn't complaining about that, I just don't want to cry on your couch for the rest of my life. This isn't me."</p>

		<p>"You've got emotions, everybody does..."</p>

		<p>"Except for Tuvok."</p>

		<p>"Oh, he has them, he just suppresses them. At any rate, you're allowed and I won't tell anybody about what happened. That's between you and me. If you are so insistent about leaving, wait until I have my shower and change and then you can take a bath, recycle your uniform and then go. You'll feel a million times better."</p>

		<p>"A bath?"</p>

		<p>"Yep. I have a tub, Captain's privilege. Oils and salts are in the compartment above. Just pick up the wet towels when you're done. I know how you are, B'Elanna. You can't deny that much. I know you too well."</p>

		<p>"Thanks," she said sheepishly. It was nice to be treated so well, mothered in fact. Janeway left her alone and went about her daily ministrations. She promptly fell asleep and didn't wake up until her hostess had left, the swishing of the door being her wake up call.</p>

		<p>"Kahless," she moaned as she stretched out on the couch. She uncoiled from the couch, carefully folded the sheets and blanket, smelling them one final time, and set them carefully on the couch. &gt;What does she do to these sheets? They smell so much better than mine. Familiar, in fact.=</p>

		<p>She shrugged to herself, as she would in those private moments, went back to the ensuite and prepared herself a bath. She stripped her clothes, throwing them haphazardly around the bathroom. She climbed into the tub and sighed at the contact in the gloriously warm and beautifully scented water. She could almost forget what had happened the night before.</p>

		<p>Almost, that is.</p>

		<p>Sadness rushed over her once again and she began sobbing those wracking tears that had washed over her the night before. It wasn't about Tom or the fact that he had cheated on her. It was about the fact that she was made a fool and that she was alone once more.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>Seven entered the captain's quarters upon her request to make sure that B'Elanna ate something that morning. She didn't plan on sticking around too long since she would more than likely be yelled at by the combative engineer. Her plans changed when she heard the sound of crying coming from the bathroom.</p>

		<p>She walked quietly into the next room and peeked around the door jam of the bathroom. There she saw the object of her affection, B'Elanna Torres, barely covered by bubbles in a warm tub. However, none of that was important. B'Elanna was crying and harder than she had the night before.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna," Seven whispered, her voice taking on a softness that it hadn't had before. The engineer didn't hear her and continued to sob, hugging her knees.</p>

		<p>Seven stepped into the bathroom, knelt beside the tub and gently wrapped her arms around B'Elanna. "It is alright, Lanna. I am here. Do not worry," she cooed softly.</p>

		<p>"Why did he do it?"</p>

		<p>"I do not know," Seven replied. She stroked B'Elanna's hair and kissed the top of her ridges. </p>

		<p>B'Elanna wrapped her arms around Seven's torso, putting all of her effort into the embrace.</p>

		<p>"I was such a fool. Such a fool."</p>

		<p>"You were not the fool, Lanna. Tom was for treating you so awfully."</p>

		<p>"What? Huh?" B'Elanna said as she backed away quickly. It was as if she wasn't expecting a response. She covered her chest with her crossed arms and looked at Seven with horror in her eyes. "Seven, what are you doing here?"</p>

		<p>"The captain asked me to check in on you and make sure that you ate a good breakfast." Seven said, looking her directly in the eyes. "If you are worried that I will not keep this confidential, you should not. I will tell no one. Also, the only parts of your anatomy that I saw unclothed were your back and your knees."</p>

		<p>"Can you leave me alone for a few moments?" B'Elanna asked.</p>

		<p>"If you insist. I am willing, however, to wash your hair if you would like me to do so. I know that I enjoy it when the Captain washes my hair."</p>

		<p>"Janeway washes your hair?"</p>

		<p>"On occasion. It is not sexual, Lieutenant. She has been showing me different ways that I could do my hair. We are friends."</p>

		<p>"At any rate, I think I can do that myself, Seven. Thanks."</p>

		<p>"It would be no trouble," Seven replied. She wasn't going to take no for an answer. "I have the day off."</p>

		<p>"If you insist, but give me one of those wash clothes."</p>

		<p>Seven handed over a wash cloth and B'Elanna placed it across her chest before she settled back into the water.</p>

		<p>"It surprises me that you are so shy about your body," Seven said as she reached for the showerhead. Without waiting for a response, she doused B'Elanna's hair with warm water.</p>

		<p>"Why do you say that?" her charge replied, spitting up water in the process.</p>

		<p>"You covered yourself."</p>

		<p>"Well, usually people only share that part of themselves when they have become..."</p>

		<p>"Lovers?" Seven asked as she massaged the shampoo into B'Elanna's hair and scalp. Her touch was firm, yet gentle. B'Elanna didn't feel the scraping of metal on her skull like she thought she would have. This was becoming a very pleasurable experience for B'Elanna, as well as Seven.</p>

		<p>"That's one way to put it. And I do not know you all that well."</p>

		<p>"I have been aboard for three years."</p>

		<p>"I know."</p>

		<p>"Do you wish to know me better?"</p>

		<p>"Maybe. I mean, we aren't the best of friends. We fight like cats and dogs most times."</p>

		<p>"Our relationship has become less adversarial as of late. I do appreciate your kind words when I thought I was dying."</p>

		<p>"I was concerned."</p>

		<p>Seven smiled behind B'Elanna's back at the thought. &gt;She cares for me,' she thought.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Mr. Paris to my ready room," Janeway said as she tapped her comm badge and settled in her chair behind the desk. She hated doing this part of her job -- dealing with her crew's personal problems. True, she liked the fact that the closeness of some of the crew allowed them to come to her and cry on her shoulder if they needed to like B'Elanna did the night before. She did like being able to share the good times better, of course, but these few sad times showed her that she really meant something beyond the one who gave orders. If they were in the Alpha Quadrant rather than so far from home, they probably would not be that close.</p>

		<p>Kathryn became Captain Janeway, putting her mask firmly over her personable face. She became very stern and unemotional as her strongest mask dictated. Still, she exuded some warmth. That much couldn't be hidden by her mask, but it was tempered, so that the one in front of her knew that the warmth wasn't necessarily for them.</p>

		<p>"You wished to see me, Captain?" Tom said as the doors swished open and he stepped inside. His stance was a little too casual, but that was the nature of his attention stance. He refused to look away from his commanding officers like Starfleet officers had been taught in their basic training, he was much too good for that. Or at least he thought. He held his hands in front of him. He leaned on one leg rather than the other, didn't matter which leg because it kept changing. His shoulders were not slumped but they were not straight as they should have been.</p>

		<p>"Sit," Janeway snapped. &gt;His eyes are swollen.' Her eyebrow raised. "Lt. Torres came to see me last night." Tom tried to speak but she stopped him. "She wants a divorce, and from what she's told me, I don't blame her. Tell me your side of the story."</p>

		<p>"We have an open relationship."</p>

		<p>&gt;That's what Cheb Parker told me when I caught him cheating.=</p>

		<p>"Not according to B'Elanna. Was that memo lost?"</p>

		<p>"No, ma'am."</p>

		<p>"Didn't think so. Now, you can do two things. You can grant the divorce, thus showing good faith and maybe she'll take you back as a friend in the future. Or you can contest the divorce, make her even more angry than she is already, drag it out for a few weeks, until I decide that is enough and annul it without any input from you. At that point, I don't think B'Elanna would ever stand to be in your presence again which would make things incredible difficult for the rest of us. What is your choice?"</p>

		<p>"You're on her side."</p>

		<p>"When I decided to have you on my ship, Tom, I did so against the wishes of your father, but he made me promise that I wouldn't let you do anything unbecoming an officer. I accepted the responsibility of trying to be your conscious, knowing that it would be impossible, but I would be here as a sounding board. Tom, you were very stupid with this whole mess. If you were going to drop her after two weeks of marriage in favor of someone else, why did you get married at all?"</p>

		<p>"I love her, Captain. I will never stop loving her."</p>

		<p>"That doesn't answer my question."</p>

		<p>"I thought we could do it. I thought it would make us closer. She was drifting away before that. I thought I was going to lose her."</p>

		<p>"Getting married doesn't fix a relationship."</p>

		<p>He sighed and looked down at his hands, admitting to himself that he had been stupid and that she was probably right.</p>

		<p>"You weren't the only culprit in this. B'Elanna had something to do with it."</p>

		<p>"She thought I was sincere and I guess I was for a little while. Things changed when we got back on the ship. Suddenly I was the Man. Women flocked to me and they would run my programs with me and listen to me. B'Elanna didn't do those things."</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry, Tom. I know this is very difficult for the both of you."</p>

		<p>"I want to give her the divorce."</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 3">
		<p>B'Elanna Torres sat in her office in engineering, looking over the reports from the previous shifts, but having an otherwise difficult time trying to concentrate. Tom had granted her request for a divorce, and for that she was as pleased as one could be when their life is ripped apart. She had read somewhere once that divorces on Earth during the 20th and early 21st centuries caused so much stress that they were second only the death of a dearly loved one. She felt like she was going through that same stress. True, it was much easier to get a divorce in the 24th Century but it was no less painful.</p>

		<p>She had loved Tom, and now she wasn't so sure. That's what got her most. Before they were married, she could put up with almost anything. She would cuss and fight with him, but eventually she would take him back and the whole process would begin again. Why didn't she fight this time? She gave up so easily and asked for a divorce. Not only that, she had gone running to the captain about it, crying on her shoulder for hours on end. She had even allowed Seven, the ice princess, to comfort her, washing her hair and back as if she was a child.</p>

		<p>And now, she sat alone in her rarely used office, hiding from the world when she should have been realigning something somewhere, along with the rest of her team. She had been hiding since the beginning of her shift, seven hours before. She couldn't face the whispers and sympathetic looks, even though they were few and far between. She still could have sworn she saw a look coming from Vorik, a Vulcan, when he arrived for duty.</p>

		<p>The door of her office chimed and she called for them to come in. It was Seven, her back impossibly straight, her gaze impassive, her curves...</p>

		<p>Seven had spent the day before with her, washing her hair first, cooking her a wonderful breakfast with banana pancakes to rival her grandmother's, and then including her in her activities with Naomi. No matter how much she didn't want to admit it, she actually enjoyed spending time with Flotter and Treevis, and even Seven and Naomi. Especially Seven. Once they had left the captain's, Seven did not once bring up Tom or any recent breakup. She did not even tell B'Elanna that she could talk to her if she needed to. Instinctively, however, she knew that she could trust Seven to be objective, trustworthy and even silent. She didn't know how she knew that, she just knew. Maybe it was because she had spent so much time with the captain and no one knew of their activities. Seven never supported or denied any claims of a sexual relationship with her captain. She just let the rumors be. B'Elanna had to respect the girl for that.</p>

		<p>"Whatcha need, Seven?" B'Elanna said curtly, warmth hinting I her eyes..</p>

		<p>"You have been working for seven hours and have not taken a nutritional supplement. Also, you did not eat breakfast this morning. You must take care of yourself, Lt. Torres. It is imperative to me that you do so," Seven said.</p>

		<p>"To you?"</p>

		<p>Seven blushed. &gt;What the hell? I didn't think the Borg could blush,' B'Elanna thought.</p>

		<p>"I consider you to be a friend, Lieutenant, and do not wish to see you harmed in any way. To be so would not only subject me to hardship, but to the ship and her crew. You are very important to the survival to this vessel."</p>

		<p>"A friend?"</p>

		<p>"Yes." Seven didn't explain herself.</p>

		<p>"Thanks, Seven. I'll eat something."</p>

		<p>"Would you like to accompany me to the messhall? Neelix is serving tacos and fajitas tonight. I believe he calls it Mexican Fiesta Night."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna chuckled. She never thought that she'd hear that combination of words from Seven's mouth, let alone the entire conversation.</p>

		<p>"I would love to," B'Elanna said, a smile on her face that was quickly matched by Seven's toothy grin. Again, B'Elanna nearly fell over with surprise, but she took it all in stride and followed the tall blonde out of engineering and to the turbolift.</p>

		<p>They didn't make it to the messhall, however. The violent rocking of the ship and the shut down of the turbolift saw to that.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Report," Janeway ordered in her most stern voice as she exited her ready room.</p>

		<p>"Ship decloaking off of the starboard bow. It has fired on us," Tuvok said impassively. "Damage only to the deflector grid."</p>

		<p>"Shields! Hail them," Janeway barked.</p>

		<p>"No response."</p>

		<p>"Their weapons have been charged again."</p>

		<p>"Evasive maneuvers, Mr. Paris."</p>

		<p>The ship twisted and turned throughout space as Tom tried to avoid the supposed enemy ship and its weapons fire. They were only clipped once by the disruptors, but it was enough to kick their shields down to 6%.</p>

		<p>"Enemy vessel, you have crossed our path. You must stand down and prepare to be boarded," came the metallic voice over the intercom. Harry hadn't even had the chance to patch a channel through.</p>

		<p>"We had no idea that we were in your path, but we will not stand down and you will not board us. Perhaps we can come to a diplomatic solution."</p>

		<p>"Diplomacy is weak! You will stand down!" The channel went dead and the ship fired again.</p>

		<p>"This is pissing me off," Janeway said under breath. "Target their weapons and fire at will. Full phasers then let's get the hell out of here."</p>

		<p>"Aye, Captain," Tuvok said as he did exactly as she said. Unfortunately, they were a little more resilient than Voyager was. The phaser fire only served as a fly on their nose, but it was enough to distract them. Tom took the opportunity to warp out of there at the highest speed possible. Janeway wasn't in the mood for fighting that day. It wasn't a good day to die.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"What the hell was that?" B'Elanna said into the total darkness of the turbolift.</p>

		<p>"It seems as though we are being attacked," Seven replied before she bumped into B'Elanna. She couldn't say that it was an unpleasant sensation.</p>

		<p>"And the turbolifts go down? Kahless."</p>

		<p>"Why do you continually refer to Kahless? He will be of no help with the turbolifts."</p>

		<p>"It's a curse, Seven. It's like when humans say &gt;Oh my God' or &gt;Jesus Christ' or something. Can you see anything?"</p>

		<p>"Nothing. My optical implant requires some light to operate in the dark. However, there is no light in here."</p>

		<p>"Are we still in the turbolift?"</p>

		<p>Seven reached out and felt the walls, and then something decidedly more soft. A yelp from the other passenger told her what she had put her hand on. She made a retreat.</p>

		<p>"I... I... I'm sorry, Lieutenant. I did not realize that was your breast."</p>

		<p>"Well, stop feeling around like a blind man at the beach and stand still," B'Elanna said, not entirely flustered by the hand that was momentarily on her breast. Even though Seven had been feeling for the wall, her touch was gentle, and for a second, welcome. Tom had never touched her like that and, for a moment, she remembered the previous day's bath and how Seven had been with her that time, too.</p>

		<p>"I am essentially blind, Lieutenant."</p>

		<p>"So am I and please call me B'Elanna." &gt;I like the sound of my name coming off of your lips,' she thought secretly. &gt;You never whine.=</p>

		<p>B'Elanna shook her head and then reached out to the wall for support, only to find a softer support and it was breathing.</p>

		<p>"I am having difficulties trying to concentrate, B'Elanna, especially with your hand on my chest," Seven said, her voice breathy and full of desire. B'Elanna didn't move her hand.</p>

		<p>"Why?" Seven didn't reply with words, she simply sought out B'Elanna's hand with hers and held it to her chest, lightly stroking the back with her thumb. B'Elanna stepped closer and leaned into the caress only to have Seven touch her forehead and trace her ridges with her Borg hand.</p>

		<p>"You are very beautiful, B'Elanna," Seven breathed. "Even in the dark."</p>

		<p>"Why am I feeling this way?" B'Elanna asked, her voice catching. The emotion was too heady. She found herself breathing in Seven's scent, only to find that it was the same as the sheets Kathryn had given her two nights before. But there was another scent underneath it, a metallic tang on top of blood and a woman's desire. She couldn't tell if the desire was her own or if it was Seven's, but she knew that the blood was the blonde's and she wanted to taste it. She didn't want to take it, though, she wanted Seven to give it to her.</p>

		<p>Seven took B'Elanna in her arms and stroked her back. Her warm breath danced across B'Elanna's forehead.</p>

		<p>"I would very much like to kiss you," Seven said. B'Elanna responded kissing her neck, up her jaw and instinctively found her lips. They pressed together, content in the slight contact until desire won over and tongues found each other across lips and teeth. B'Elanna purred deep in her throat and chest, and seven came back with a moan into her mouth.</p>

		<p>The half-Klingon put her hands on Seven's behind and massaged it, kneaded it like bread. One of Seven's legs wrapped around B'Elanna's, pressing her centre onto the Chief Engineer's hip. Soon, Seven's back was up against the wall and B'Elanna held her up off the ground, trying desperately to get further inside the Borg.</p>

		<p>"Oh, God, I love you," B'Elanna whispered despite herself. She continued to kiss the woman until the lights turned on and the doors opened to the bridge. And that's where the entire bridge compliment, including Tom Paris, found them.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna turned bright red as she slipped Seven down the wall. Seven straightened her hair.</p>

		<p>"Ladies," Janeway said with a ever so slight smirk on her face.</p>

		<p>"Yes, ma'am," B'Elanna squeaked.</p>

		<p>"Ready room, please."</p>

		<p>They both nodded and followed the captain to her inner sanctum. The doors shut and B'Elanna instantly felt that she was a part of some inquisition.</p>

		<p>"Care to explain yourselves?"</p>

		<p>"The turbolift and the lights went out. We became &gt;carried away," Seven said.</p>

		<p>"Lt. Torres, you have repairs to see to in engineering. I want a full report at the staff meeting in one hour. Please try to be a little more discrete in the future. Tom still is a bridge officer on this crew."</p>

		<p>"Aye, Captain."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna turned on her heel and left.</p>

		<p>"I thought you were going to wait before you said or did anything."</p>

		<p>"I was," Seven replied. "I did not tell her how I felt. She got so close, Kathryn. I cannot explain..." The Borg began to cry. It would be something that the rest of the crew would never see, but Janeway had seen it before. She had seen it whenever B'Elanna hurt her young charge with a harsh word or an unexplained fight.</p>

		<p>"Did she take advantage of you?" Kathryn asked as she put an arm around her shoulders.</p>

		<p>"No, I asked her to kiss me. It just happened. Kathryn, she said that she loved me. How can she love me when she loved Ensign Paris two days ago?"</p>

		<p>"Love for others doesn't stop just because you are married or involved with someone. It's just how you deal with it. Maybe she loved you al along. Maybe she was caught up in the moment. I can't explain it, darling. You need to talk to her. That's the only way you'll ever know."</p>

		<p>"I am afraid."</p>

		<p>"Of what?"</p>

		<p>"Of giving my heart to her and having her rip it apart. I do not believe that I can function without her."</p>

		<p>"People have been feeling like this for millennia, Seven, and no one has ever been able to give advice sage enough to counteract a heartbreak. But if you don't take that chance, you might never feel her love in return."</p>

		<p>Seven nodded and wiped away her tears. She left without saying goodbye or waiting to be dismissed. She had some things to think about and decide. Would it ever be love for B'Elanna, or was it just lust like in the turbolift? What she said could have been just a reaction to the situation. Seven didn't know if she could trust it or not, even despite what the captain had said.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 4">
		<p>B'Elanna worked at a fevered pitch, trying to get everything repaired and in order, even though there wasn't a whole lot to repair. Mostly it was the deflector and the shields and a weakening in the hull on deck 15. Still, she worked hard, trying to forget that she had just kissed Seven, told her that she loved her and got caught by the entire bridge crew, not to mention slightly reprimanded by Captain Janeway.</p>

		<p>"Why did I tell her that?" she muttered to herself over and over again, trying not to be heard.</p>

		<p>"Excuse me?" Vorik asked, passing by.</p>

		<p>"Nothing."</p>

		<p>"You clearly asked a question, Lieutenant. Maybe I can help you."</p>

		<p>"I doubt it, Vorik. It's not a question for you to peruse with your Vulcan logic. It's rather personal... and emotional."</p>

		<p>He nodded at this last fact and walked away. B'Elanna knew that both he and Tuvok neither liked anything emotional, especially when they came for emotional species.</p>

		<p>"Damn!" B'Elanna said as she hit her head on the roof of the Jefferies tube she was shimmying out of.</p>

		<p>"Can I help you, Lieutenant?" came the reply.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna cupped the forming knot on the back of her head and turned around to see Seven standing where Vorik once stood, in the access terminal of the Jefferies tub. She looked at B'Elanna like nothing had happened. She didn't look distracted at all.</p>

		<p>"I'm fine, Seven."</p>

		<p>"You are forming a bump on the back of our head. The doctor should look at that. "I'll see him in a minute."</p>

		<p>"We need to talk, B'Elanna. May I meet you in your quarters tonight?"</p>

		<p>"Yes. I'd like that. Meet me after the meeting."</p>

		<p>"I will do that."</p>

		<p>Seven nodded and walked out. She couldn't do much else. B'Elanna deposited her tools in the proper place, logged off of work after giving her orders to Vorik. She went to the doctor, feigned clumsiness, and got her bruise fixed after getting a lecture from the doctor. She shook it off and made her way to the conference room where she was the last to arrive.</p>

		<p>"How are the repairs coming, B'Elanna?" Janeway asked first.</p>

		<p>"Fine. The deflector is repaired and weaknesses throughout the hull should be repaired by morning. The beta and gamma shifts should be able to take care of that."</p>

		<p>"Fine," Janeway said with a nod. "Any idea who these aliens are, Seven?"</p>

		<p>"All evidence indicates that they are no more than pirates in this sector. The sensor logs indicate they had a grouping of weapons and shield systems from various cultures."</p>

		<p>"Should we be concerned?"</p>

		<p>"I do not know," Seven said. It wasn't often that she said those four words in succession, but when she did say it, she meant that the Borg haven't heard of the presence. "If further evidence of activity from a unified force of pirates occur and we do experience another attack in a similar manner, we should be concerned. However, I suggest that we increase the shields around the deflector dish. Their attack seemed to be centered on that point."</p>

		<p>"Is there some way we can disguise the deflector in case of another attack?"</p>

		<p>"Under the ship, there is a star viewing bay that not many people are aware of," B'Elanna began. "The hull can be transparent and opaque with the flip of a switch. Perhaps we can use the same technology to hide the deflector."</p>

		<p>"Get working on it tomorrow morning, Lieutenant. Neelix, do you have anything to add?"</p>

		<p>"No, ma'am. I have not encountered this species or type of ship before."</p>

		<p>"Thank you all. You are dismissed."</p>

		<p>Tom caught Seven by the arm on the way out. "I saw what you were doing to my wife. You will stop, you Borg bitch."</p>

		<p>"She is no longer your wife and you do remember the agreement we had two nights ago?" Seven asked, keeping the tone in her voice casual. He continued to stare at her. "If you continue to hold my arm like that, I will be forced to make the same deal concerning me."</p>

		<p>She glared at him and he let go. He did not stop staring at her,, however, in a weakly menacing glare, but Seven dismissed him out of hand and went to the turbolift. B'Elanna was aboard, but so was Chakotay. He smiled at the sight of her.</p>

		<p>"Are there going to be any shows for me today?" he asked.</p>

		<p>"I do not know what you are talking about, Commander," Seven said in a playful voice with a quirk of her eyebrow. B'Elanna looked mortified while Chakotay chuckled.</p>

		<p>When the doors opened up, Seven walked out and B'Elanna followed.</p>

		<p>"Were you joking with Chakotay?" B'Elanna asked as they made their way to her quarters.</p>

		<p>"Yes. Was it not appreciated?"</p>

		<p>"It's okay. You just seem to be a little different these days.</p>

		<p>"I am the same person. Maybe your perception has changed."</p>

		<p>"Maybe."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna opened the doors to her quarters and stepped inside. Seven followed and stood just inside the door.</p>

		<p>"Would you like something to drink?" B'Elanna asked. "Oh, of course, you do not require..."</p>

		<p>"I would very much like a glass of wine."</p>

		<p>"What kind?"</p>

		<p>"Whichever you prefer. The captain usually chooses for me."</p>

		<p>"Do you have a preference?"</p>

		<p>"I enjoy Merlot."</p>

		<p>"Then Merlot it is."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna replicated two glasses of deep red wine and handed one to Seven. She kicked off her shoes and sat on the couch.</p>

		<p>"Sit down, stay a while," she said.</p>

		<p>Seven complied and sat down a respectful distance from B'Elanna. The half-Klingon could still feel the heat radiating off the young woman.</p>

		<p>"You can take off your shoes, if you like."</p>

		<p>"They are attached to the rest of my suit. It would be impossible to remove them without removing all of my clothing," Seven said honestly. B'Elanna's eyes opened wide. &gt;That would be nice,' she thought. "Unless, that is what you wish me to do."</p>

		<p>"I think we would both be distracted if you did that."</p>

		<p>"I agree. Did you mean it when you said that you loved me?"</p>

		<p>"You don't pull any punches, do you?"</p>

		<p>"If you mean that I do not engage in small talk, that is correct. It is sometimes futile, especially when we are here to discuss what happened on the turbolift earlier."</p>

		<p>"Oh."</p>

		<p>"I don't know," B'Elanna said, rubbing her forehead. "I mean, I'm starting to have feelings for you and I can't really explain them. They are pleasant feelings, but I am very confused by them. I just divorced my husband and that pain is still very new. I don't want to be hurt again."</p>

		<p>"I do not want to be hurt, period, but Kathryn assured me that you cannot avoid pain sometimes, especially when some good can come of it."</p>

		<p>"I'm the one that you have a crush on, right?"</p>

		<p>"It is not a crush, B'Elanna."</p>

		<p>"Then what is it?"</p>

		<p>"I love you," she said quietly, but blatantly. "I do not expect you to return my feelings, but I would like you to be honest with me. If you do not love me, then I will not waste your time with platitudes and my romantic feelings towards you. I am not important."</p>

		<p>"Don't ever say that again, Seven," B'Elanna said as she cupped the blonde's face. "You are very important, to the ship and to me."</p>

		<p>"But you do not love me."</p>

		<p>"I love how you have treated me the past couple of days. You have not been harsh to me at all, nor have you forced me to do anything I didn't want to do. I love it when you call me B'Elanna and not lieutenant. You never whine..."</p>

		<p>"But you do not love me," Seven repeated.</p>

		<p>"You're not listening. I think I do love you."</p>

		<p>Tears flowed down Seven's face at the sound of those words. No one had ever told her that before, at least that she could remember.</p>

		<p>"Don't cry, Seven," B'Elanna said, her own tears forming anew as she wiped away Seven's with her thumbs.</p>

		<p>"I am very happy that you love me."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna smiled softly and kissed Seven very tenderly on the lips.</p>

		<p>"Good, stay that way."</p>

		<p>"I wish for you to be happy, too."</p>

		<p>"I am, with you. I feel very safe with you, and loved."</p>

		<p>"I am glad. What do we do now?"</p>

		<p>"I'll fix some dinner. I don't know about you, but I'm hungry."</p>

		<p>"You do not wish to make love?"</p>

		<p>"More than anything," B'Elanna said, feeling the heat in her groin increase. "But we should eat and I think that I would really enjoy just holding you tonight. Let's get used to each other and get to know each other a little better before we do that."</p>

		<p>"Are you scared?"</p>

		<p>"A little. Are you?"</p>

		<p>"Very."</p>

		<p>"I think a little fright is okay. I don't want to hurt you, Seven. That's what frightens me. Wouldn't this be your first time?"</p>

		<p>"Yes. I was waiting for you."</p>

		<p>"You shouldn't have waited for me. I might not even be all that good. I never have been with a woman before."</p>

		<p>"Neither have I. We will just have to learn as we go," Seven said with a small smile.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna returned the smile and kissed her lightly on the lips. "I want it to be special for you, baby. I don't want it to be rushed. We have to go back to work tomorrow morning."</p>

		<p>"We have the next day off."</p>

		<p>"Yes, we do."</p>

		<p>"Do you think of me as a baby?"</p>

		<p>"It's a term of endearment. I think of you as my baby. I want to take care of you."</p>

		<p>"You already do, Lanna, you already do."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna smiled wildly and wondered how could she ever be so lucky to get a girl like Seven. Hell, to get anyone like Seven would be a miracle. She was a genius and shaped like a goddess and she loved her with her whole heart. B'Elanna could tell it but just looking in her eyes.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna set about cooking them some dinner. She programmed in a chicken and pasta dish, knowing that Seven's stomach didn't like heavy things like steak. It didn't go well with Merlot, but it would make her love happy.</p>

		<p>They took turns feeding one another on the couch, their bodies pressed up against one another and their mouths occasionally sucking on messy fingers.</p>

		<p>"I am enjoying this activity," Seven said, her forefinger in B'Elanna's mouth as the half-Klingon ran her tongue over it.</p>

		<p>"I am, too," B'Elanna said when she let the finger go.</p>

		<p>The &gt;activity' continued for another half an hour or so, leaving them nothing much to concentrate on but each other. Once the dishes were recycled, Seven pinned B'Elanna on the couch and kissed her deeply, causing her lady loved to purr contently. Their hands traveled over the other's body, careful not to touch any hot spots, but only to massage arms and legs and backs. After an hour, they came up for air. Seven wanted to take B'Elanna to bed and ravish her until she begged her to let up, but B'Elanna wouldn't allow that. She forced them to cool their passion down, showing Seven how they could hold one another without making love and making her see that it was just as good.</p>

		<p>Morning found the two women, still on the couch, still in each other's arms, and still dressed. They had fallen into a deep sleep together like they were holding their favorite stuffed animals. It was comforting to them both. Seven had difficulties sleeping in the captain's quarters, no matter what she did.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 5">
		<p>Janeway sat in her office, rubbing her temples. Seven had spent the night with B'Elanna. Tom had spent the night getting drunk on the holodeck. Harry had tried to console him, but all he got for his trouble was a black eye. Harry refused to press charges, but Janeway though it best that Tom clean Harry's room for a month and clean out the air filters her room for just as long. That seemed like suitable punishment.</p>

		<p>"You wanted to see me, Captain?" Seven asked as she stood in front of Janeway's desk. She hadn't bothered to ask for entry, she just came in like she owned the place.</p>

		<p>"Yes, Seven. Are you sure you didn't know anything about those aliens yesterday?"</p>

		<p>"I know the original creators of their ship design and the different characteristics of the weapons and who they were created by, but I do not know of the aliens. All the evidence is contradicting. The weapons indicate the design of the Gundari, the shields of the Bacchi and Artims, and the hull is made from a..."</p>

		<p>"All of that is in your report, yes. But who are they?"</p>

		<p>"It is difficult to know without seeing their faces, Kathryn. Do you have a headache?"</p>

		<p>"Yes. I just need caffeine."</p>

		<p>"That is probably aggravating it and your stomach. I will get you some tea."</p>

		<p>Seven moved to the replicator and programmed some chamomile tea with milk and handed it to the captain.</p>

		<p>"How do you deal with me?"</p>

		<p>"You are my friend. I make allowances," Seven said with a slight grin. "Did you sleep last night?"</p>

		<p>"A little. I can't sleep right now."</p>

		<p>"Is there a problem? Perhaps Tuvok can show you some meditation and relaxation techniques. A warm bath?"</p>

		<p>"I tried all of that. I don't have the time to sleep. Something about those pirates is bothering me. I can't put a finger on it."</p>

		<p>"Because you are tired. I feel wonderful this morning."</p>

		<p>"From the woman who probably didn't get any sleep last night."</p>

		<p>"I slept very well last night."</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna wear you out?"</p>

		<p>Seven quirked an eyebrow and then squinted. "If you are referring to the fact that I spent the night at her place, she did not wear me out. I was merely comfortable in her embrace. Kathryn, I hope some day that you find someone to make you feel the way B'Elanna makes me feel."</p>

		<p>"Borg endurance. I'm sorry, it wasn't any of my business."</p>

		<p>"I can no longer come to you if I have a question?"</p>

		<p>"You can come to me, Seven, anytime. You just don't have to tell me about your sexual experiences, if you don't want. I'm not sure that B'Elanna would appreciate it."</p>

		<p>"We did not copulate last night. B'Elanna wishes for us to wait until we know each other better."</p>

		<p>"That's smart of her."</p>

		<p>"She is very caring."</p>

		<p>"I'm sure."</p>

		<p>"You changed the topic."</p>

		<p>"Huh?" Janeway asked, perfectly aware that she did turn the conversation away from her.</p>

		<p>"We were talking about you getting some sleep."</p>

		<p>"Oh, I can't right now."</p>

		<p>"You will."</p>

		<p>"I have reports."</p>

		<p>"That can be done tomorrow." Seven tapped her commbadge. "Seven to Chakotay."</p>

		<p>"Go ahead, Seven."</p>

		<p>"The captain will be taking the rest of the day off. Please cover the bridge."</p>

		<p>"Aye aye, Admiral," he joked.</p>

		<p>"Thank you."</p>

		<p>Seven tugged on the captain's hand and led her out onto the bridge, with everyone staring of course, and then to the turbolift and her quarters.</p>

		<p>"They must thin we're strange or something," Kathryn said as she settled in on her couch.</p>

		<p>"Then let them. It's none of their business." Seven pulled off Janeway's boots and tunic. "It is my turn to take care of you."</p>

		<p>"How is that shield thing we discussed last night?"</p>

		<p>"The opaque shielding? B'Elanna and I were installing the second emitter when you called."</p>

		<p>"You should get back."</p>

		<p>"I will, in a minute."</p>

		<p>Seven pulled Janeway up once more and dragged her to her bedroom. There, she ordered Janeway to strip down and get into the bed.</p>

		<p>"I am not a child, you know," Janeway grumbled and then promptly yawned.</p>

		<p>"I know, Kathryn. Sleep. I will wake you for dinner after my shift is finished."</p>

		<p>"Fine," Janeway yawned again.</p>

		<p>Seven tucked her in and left the captain's quarters. Within a few moments, she was back with B'Elanna on the deflector grid.</p>

		<p>"What took you so long?" B'Elanna asked, a little frustrated with the emitter she was working on. It just wouldn't fit.</p>

		<p>Seven played with her tricorder and then slapped the emitter into place.</p>

		<p>"The captain was too tired to continue working. I put her to bed."</p>

		<p>"You put the captain to bed? How did you do that? She's more stubborn than I am."</p>

		<p>"I gave her two choices, she go willingly or I sling her over my shoulder and carry her down to her quarters. She chose the logical path."</p>

		<p>"I assume that she did."</p>

		<p>"She knew that I spent the night in your quarters."</p>

		<p>"Checking up on you, huh?"</p>

		<p>"I do not know if it was that she was checking up on me or the fact that Mr. Paris was checking up on you and got into a brawl with Mr. Kim last night after learning where I slept. People do a lot of assuming on this ship."</p>

		<p>"Does she think that we did it?"</p>

		<p>"She did at first. I told her otherwise and she thought you were very smart about wanting to wait."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna chuckled. "Is she going to know everything that we do?"</p>

		<p>"She is the captain and my friend. It is my understanding that she will always have an inkling of what is going on in the confines of this hull. Do you think not?</p>

		<p>B'Elanna sat up and took Seven's hands in hers. "I know you are really close to her, Seven, and I'm glad that you are. A girl can't have too many friends. She just doesn't need to know every single thing that we do."</p>

		<p>"I understand but I will not lie if she asks me a question."</p>

		<p>"And that's one of the reasons why I love you."</p>

		<p>Seven smiled and blushed a little.</p>

		<p>"You are so cute when you blush," B'Elanna said with a wide smile as she moved onto the next emitter. Seven followed and gave her a pat on the butt before she sat down. "Hey! Did I say you could touch me there? No. So don't, okay? I'm getting involved with a horny Borg who has more endurance than a Vulcan. Geez. What am I going to do with you?"</p>

		<p>"You are being facetious."</p>

		<p>"No, I'm not."</p>

		<p>"Then I will tell you what you can do with me."</p>

		<p>"Oh you will, will you? And what, pray tell, would that be?"</p>

		<p>Seven leaned into her ear and whispered what exactly, in precise terms, B'Elanna could do to her, leaving B'Elanna all hot and bothered in the process despite the technical language.</p>

		<p>"Where did you learn all of that?"</p>

		<p>"In the database."</p>

		<p>"How long have you been doing your homework?"</p>

		<p>"Remember when I was studying you and Mr. Paris?"</p>

		<p>"Yes."</p>

		<p>"Since two weeks before then."</p>

		<p>"Kahless."</p>

		<p>"Kahless can't help you now, bangwI."</p>

		<p>"You know Klingon, too?"</p>

		<p>"Just the terms of endearment. Do you wish for me to learn more?"</p>

		<p>"You probably already know more than I do. I grew up on a human colony."</p>

		<p>"Oh." Seven leaning in close again and kissed B'Elanna's ear. She pulled the lobe into her mouth and began to suck, causing the half-Klingon's breath to catch.</p>

		<p>"Someone could walk in on us and we're working, Seven," B'Elanna said in choppy language.</p>

		<p>"Do you wish to wait?" Seven replied, now holding B'Elanna's breast and caressing her stiff nipple through the thin t-shirt.</p>

		<p>"We should," B'Elanna gasped. She pushed Seven's hand away. "We still have four more emitters to go and then we have to test them."</p>

		<p>"We could get some help."</p>

		<p>"Then I wouldn't be able to flirt with you."</p>

		<p>"You confuse me. You do not wish to engage in &gt;making out' while on duty, but you want to flirt, which will be very difficult on me."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna grinned, showing all the teeth in her mouth that she could. "That's right."</p>

		<p>"You are impossible."</p>

		<p>"I know."</p>

		<p>Seven groaned and went to work on the next emitter. The job being more busy work than real work, was done in no time. They tested it, shook the ship around a little, and found that it worked just fine. Neither one could think of anything else to do regarding the project, so they returned to B'Elanna's cabin.</p>

		<p>"I have to make sure that the captain eats her supper," Seven said, a small pout forming on her lips.</p>

		<p>"What about my supper?" B'Elanna teased, nipping at Seven's neck.</p>

		<p>"I will not be long."</p>

		<p>"Seven kissed the shorter woman's forehead and turned to leave. B'Elanna caught her by the arm before she was out the door. Suddenly, the half-Klingon was at a loss for words. She gave a small smile, kissed Seven very hard and left her knees to buckle outside her cabin.</p>

		<p>Seven shook her head and then strutted in her usual stride to the captain's quarters. She rang the doorbell and waited for the captain's order for her to come.</p>

		<p>"Computer, what is Captain Janeway's location?"</p>

		<p>"She is in her quarters."</p>

		<p>"What is her status?"</p>

		<p>"She is not active."</p>

		<p>Seven keyed in a security code that she had seen Janeway use before and walked into her quarters. Within, she could hear Janeway snoring, quite loudly in fact, and set about making her dinner - pot roast which she knew was the captain's favorite. Fortunately, she could cook better than the captain and rarely burned anything. Let's hear it for Borg perfection. They may not eat, but they sure can cook.</p>

		<p>When dinner was finished, Seven woke the captain, told her that dinner was ready and waited for her to come out to the living room. She did, after a minute, dressed in her favorite comfy robe.</p>

		<p>"Thank you for forcing me to go to bed, Seven. I needed that," she said after a yawn. "And dinner, too."</p>

		<p>"I told you that I would make sure that you had dinner tonight."</p>

		<p>"But you must want to spend time with B'Elanna. You should go."</p>

		<p>"I will, after I make sure that you eat your supper."</p>

		<p>"Are you not eating?"</p>

		<p>"I am going to have dinner with B'Elanna. You need not worry for me."</p>

		<p>"I'll stop. I must sound like a mother hen."</p>

		<p>"No more than I," Seven said, sitting across from Kathryn, with elbow resting on the table and her head resting in her palm.</p>

		<p>"You look very starry eyed tonight, Seven."</p>

		<p>"What is that?"</p>

		<p>"You look in love, starry eyed. I sear I'll eat if you want to go to her. IT's no problem."</p>

		<p>"I have a question, actually," Seven said.</p>

		<p>"Okay. Go ahead."</p>

		<p>"What was your first sexual experience like?"</p>

		<p>"Oh God," Kathryn groaned. She never expected to have this conversation with Seven, ever.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry. I did not mean to make you uncomfortable."</p>

		<p>"No, it's not that. People just aren't as forward as you are. Seven. I never thought I'd have this conversation with you. I sure didn't have it with my mother."</p>

		<p>"Do you consider me to be your daughter?"</p>

		<p>"In a way. I didn't give birth to you, but we have that kind of relationship."</p>

		<p>"I do not know what it means to have a mother, unless it means that a mother will allow me to be assimilated by the Borg because of her thirst knowledge."</p>

		<p>"It doesn't mean that, Seven. I'm sure that she didn't mean to get you assimilated. It was an accident."</p>

		<p>"Because they became careless. They got too close. But what's done is done. I cannot change the past and will not because I would not have met you or B'Elanna, correct?"</p>

		<p>"Still, I wish you could have had more time with your parents. I had a wonderful relationship with my mother. We fought like cats and dogs occasionally like you and I do, but we always came back to each other, like you and I do, also. I don't want to take the place of your mother, Seven. No one could do that. I just want you to know that I care for you. You can tell me anything. I might moan and groan about it, but that's my own puritanical background coming back to haunt me again."</p>

		<p>"I would not like to call you mother, but I do consider you to have a very important role in my life that includes some of the duties that a mother at my age would perform, like providing advice. Am I correct in assuming that?"</p>

		<p>"Yes."</p>

		<p>"Are you going to answer my question?"</p>

		<p>"Uh, oh. Um, sure. What was it again?"</p>

		<p>"How was your first sexual experience?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, yes," Kathryn said. She thought back and then rolled her eyes. "Uh, Cheb Packer."</p>

		<p>"A male?"</p>

		<p>"Yes. I'm afraid that it wasn't very good, Seven. We were teenagers fooling around and it hurt like hell."</p>

		<p>"Why did it hurt?"</p>

		<p>Janeway tried to explain the birds and the bees to Seven as cleanly as possible and how men and women were different. Seven knew all of the technicalities of it, but she didn't know the feelings associated with it.</p>

		<p>"Do you think that B'Elanna and I would be the same?"</p>

		<p>"I don't think so. You both have something that Cheb and I never had. You love each other and care about each other. Cheb and I were just looking to get our rocks off, so to speak."</p>

		<p>"Have you ever slept with a woman?"</p>

		<p>"Came really close once, but we cane to the Delta Quadrant and that ended that relationship. I have no idea what she is up to now."</p>

		<p>"Weren't you in a relationship with Mark Johnson at that time?"</p>

		<p>"We were on a break. I just wanted to make sure I knew what I was leaving behind if I married him."</p>

		<p>"But you never found."</p>

		<p>"No, I did not. Look, Seven. I'm sure that if you both take your time and not rush through anything, it will be fine and it'll even get better with time as you get to know your own body and to know hers. Just take it slow."</p>

		<p>"I will remember that, Kathryn."</p>

		<p>"Good. Go to her and I do not want to hear about it tomorrow morning."</p>

		<p>"We have tomorrow off, Kathryn. I doubt that I will see you tomorrow,"Seven said as she stood. Kathryn followed suit and then put her arms around Seven.</p>

		<p>"Good night, Seven. Remember, take it slow."</p>

		<p>"I will. I love you, Kathryn. Thank you for all of your support. You may talk to me about anything, as well. You do not need to keep it all inside."</p>

		<p>"I'll remember that, Seven. Now go. B'Elanna can be impatient at times."</p>

		<p>"Seven gave one of her rare smiles, turned and left Kathryn alone, and not for the first time, Kathryn felt truly alone.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Where is she?" B'Elanna asked as she paced throughout the living area of her quarters. The table was set for dinner, candles lit the room, flowers and music filled the air but weren't intrusive as she was dressed in her silkiest black dress. She wanted everything to be perfect for her perfect love.</p>

		<p>She flopped down on her couch, not caring a bit for modesty since she was alone. Her dress was way up her thighs, not displaying anything, but surely another inch or so would change that.</p>

		<p>The door opened and Seven stepped in. She smiled at the sight of the half-Klingon and tears came to her eyes.</p>

		<p>"I do not know why I feel like crying when I see you. You are so beautiful and make me so very happy," Seven said.</p>

		<p>"Sometimes people cry when they're happy," B'Elanna whispered. Her breath was taken by Seven, dressed in the same outfit she wore before, but now bathed in candle light, her eyes glistened and her hair like spun gold.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna stood and they met each other in front of the coffee table. Their hands clasped and they stood looking into each other's eyes for an eternity, not speaking through words until B'Elanna spoke.</p>

		<p>"Did you eat dinner with the captain?"</p>

		<p>"I did not. I merely cooked dinner for her and we talked."</p>

		<p>"About what?"</p>

		<p>"I sought her advice. No, actually, I wanted to know of her experiences."</p>

		<p>"Of what?"</p>

		<p>"Her first time. She did not like it very much. She was not fulfilled. I am worried. Will our first time be as unfulfilling?"</p>

		<p>&gt;That's more than I wanted to know about her,' B'Elanna thought t herself. "I don't know. It depends on a lot of things. Did she love the person?"</p>

		<p>"She said that they were two teenagers..."</p>

		<p>"Oh! It's never good when you're a teenager, Seven. You just futz around when you don't really know where anything is."</p>

		<p>"Was your first time bad?"</p>

		<p>"Kahless, it was awful!" B'Elanna exclaimed.</p>

		<p>"Did it hurt?"</p>

		<p>"A little. Have you read anything about this?"</p>

		<p>"Not about this aspect. I read mostly about how to please a woman. I did not research on what a first sexual experience would be like," Seven said, her brow furrowed.</p>

		<p>"Seven, when a human female is a virgin, she has a membrane up there that is called the hymen. When that is punctured through sexual intercourse that includes penetration, it occasionally hurts. Compound that with inexperience and the new sensation of someone being inside of you, it could be distressing for a girl. Most times, it is. It probably was Janeway and I know it was for me."</p>

		<p>"And that happens every time?"</p>

		<p>"No, just the first time. But Seven, we have something that teenagers don't really have a lot of the time. We love each other, baby, and I'm not out only to please myself like my first one was or maybe even the captain's. You can also talk to me about anything. Tell me what feels good and what you don't ever want me to do again and I'll do the same for you. We need to communicate. That will make it so much better than some teenagers in the back seat of a hover car."</p>

		<p>Seven nodded.</p>

		<p>"Are you still scared?"</p>

		<p>"A little."</p>

		<p>"I won't hurt you, Seven. I promise."</p>

		<p>"Will you bite me?"</p>

		<p>"Not unless you want me to," B'Elanna said with a smile. "Besides, I think we have that covered. You have bitten me already."</p>

		<p>"The Son of Kvor will not be visiting tonight."</p>

		<p>"Alright," B'Elanna said with a chuckle.</p>

		<p>"You do not wish to taste my blood like Klingon's do?"</p>

		<p>B'Elanna groaned. Truth was that she did. She could smell Seven right then, but she didn't want to hurt her.</p>

		<p>"Come on," B'Elanna said as she pulled Seven out of her quarters. She took her to the sickbay and activated the EMH.</p>

		<p>"Please state the nature of the emergency," the doctor said before he turned around and saw Seven and B'Elanna. "Seven, what a pleasure it is to see you. Lieutenant." He nearly sneered at B'Elanna and the half-Klingon tried not to be insulted.</p>

		<p>"Doctor, we are requesting the highest amount of secrecy here," B'Elanna said. "You cannot talk to anyone about this. In fact, I prefer that you erase it from your memory files as soon as it is complete."</p>

		<p>"What is so urgent, Ms. Torres?"</p>

		<p>"I need you to take out some of Seven's blood, filter out the nanoprobes and give it to me."</p>

		<p>"What in heavens for?"</p>

		<p>"We are initiating mating and B'Elanna wishes not to bite me like I had in the past."</p>

		<p>"Oh. Why didn't you just say so?"</p>

		<p>The doctor put a hyprospray to Seven's neck, extracting a small amount of blood, and then programmed the hyprospray to take out the nanoprobes. He then handed over the vile to B'Elanna and wished them happy mating.</p>

		<p>"Not a word, Doctor," B'Elanna said as she dragged Seven out of the room and back to her quarters.</p>

		<p>"Isn't it better when it is warm?" Seven asked.</p>

		<p>"This'll do," B'Elanna said. "Don't worry."</p>

		<p>"I am not worried with you, Lanna. I feel very safe. Are we going to make love now?"</p>

		<p>"Let's eat dinner first," B'Elanna said as she placed the sealed vile safely on the coffee table. She then held Seven's hand to her lips and kissed the palm. "You are very beautiful tonight. I forgot to tell you that."</p>

		<p>"Thank you. You are very beautiful tonight, too. Many people were admiring you in the hallway."</p>

		<p>"They were looking at you."</p>

		<p>"No, I'm quite sure they were looking at you, Lanna. You do not often show off your body like this. You are very... sexy."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna smiled a shy smile and Seven kissed her lightly.</p>

		<p>"Perhaps we can delay dinner for a while," she suggested before she pulled Seven for a very deep and passionate kiss, freeing her hair in the process. Seven caressed her back through the thin silk as B'Elanna's hands wound in Seven's hair. "Oh, I didn't know what I was missing."</p>

		<p>"Neither did I," Seven said before she went in again. She lifted B'Elanna off the floor and took her to the bedroom. After laying her on the bed, Seven retrieved the vile from the living room. "Now?" she asked quietly.</p>

		<p>"Not just yet. Come here," B'Elanna slurred. Seven complied and allowed Lanna to unzip her biosuit and work it down her shoulders. "Your skin is like porcelain. I never imagined anyone to be so perfect."</p>

		<p>"You are mistaken. You are perfection," Seven said. Still mostly covered, she pulled B'Elanna's sheer covering over her head and marveled at the sight before her. New tears formed as her eyes danced over caramel skin, sculpted abs, handful sized breasts with fat brown nipples and a small indentation in the middle of her stomach. "What is that?"</p>

		<p>"What?"</p>

		<p>"Seven pointed to the indentation with a puzzled look on her face.</p>

		<p>"Oh, it's a belly button, Seven. You don't have one?"</p>

		<p>"I have an abdominal implant."</p>

		<p>"Oh."</p>

		<p>"What does it do?"</p>

		<p>"It's where a baby's umbilical cord to its mother was. It's how mothers feed their babies before they are born."</p>

		<p>"Oh. Seems efficient."</p>

		<p>"It is," B'Elanna said with a huge smile.</p>

		<p>Seven copied the smile and bent down. She kissed the belly button open mouthed and run her tongue around it. B'Elanna sighed at the intimate contact.</p>

		<p>"You enjoy this?" Seven asked.</p>

		<p>"Yes."</p>

		<p>Seven kissed the navel again and probed it with her tongue.</p>

		<p>"You're driving me crazy," B'Elanna moaned as she pulled Seven up and invaded her mouth with her tongue. Deftly, she pulled the rest of the biosuit off of Seven and allowed to pool on the floor. Seven stepped out of it and crawled up completely onto the bed, hovering over B'Elanna like a bird.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna flipped her lover onto her back and examined the nude body before her. It was true, she didn't have a navel, or if she did, it was covered by the surprisingly warm and soft metal that held her insides in like a corset.</p>

		<p>"Does that hurt?" B'Elanna asked as she ran her hand over it.</p>

		<p>"No. It is disgusting, I know."</p>

		<p>"It's beautiful, just like the rest of you. Don't think otherwise, ever."</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna kissed where Seven's navel would be and then up between her breasts and to her mouth. She held her hand to Seven's hip and pulled her close, nudging a leg over hers. She could feel Seven's wetness against her thigh and it only served to inflame her more.</p>

		<p>Lanna reached for the vile and after pulling away slightly, she opened it and then painted the red blood on Seven's full lips, her collar bone and her nipples. She kissed Seven again, lapping at the blood with a fervent tongue. She felt the blood lust coming on strong now, but she had to control it for fear that she might hurt Seven. She never wanted to hurt his woman. She wanted to protect her and love her, not hurt her.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna kissed down Seven's body, gently nipping at her skin with her teeth but not breaking it. She cleared every trace of blood on her collar bone, leaving the flesh hot and pink.</p>

		<p>"Oh, Lanna," Seven moaned.</p>

		<p>"Yes, baby. You taste so good," she moaned in reply as she attacked her breasts. The nipples were stiffened to points and Seven sighed loudly when B'Elanna put her mouth around one. She flicked it with her tongue and drew as much as she could into her mouth. The blood was still warm. Both from Seven's body temperature and from B'Elanna's mouth. B'Elanna smiled inwardly. She felt Seven's blood pumping through her veins and knew that she belonged to this woman only.</p>

		<p>"I am yours, always," B'Elanna said as she looked into Seven's blue eyes, the color of ocean off of Jamaica.</p>

		<p>"I belong to you," Seven said, holding B'Elanna's face in her hands. "You belong to me," she growled.</p>

		<p>"Yes," B'Elanna replied meekly. She would do that for no other and she had definitely never done it for Tom.</p>

		<p>"Louder," Seven insisted.</p>

		<p>"I belong to you," B'Elanna said in a slightly louder voice.</p>

		<p>"Show it," her lover demanded and B'Elanna smiled.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna pushed Seven on her back and held her hands above her head. She kissed the blonde fiercely and pushed her hips between her lover's thighs. The blood lust was taking over now. She knew that she wasn't going to hurt Seven, but Seven had given her permission to show all the passion she held for the woman.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna nipped down her body, letting go over hands and nuzzled the blonde hair at the juncture of her legs. Seven held her there, feeling an ache between her thighs that she had ever felt before, at least to that extent. B'Elanna broke free of it and pulled back to start kissing her ankle and then up the right leg along the Borg implant running there. It sent shivers up and down Seven's spine and a new flood of moisture accumulated in her and even on the bed coverings. B'Elanna chuckled at this new development and then ever so slowly, she approached the center of Seven's body.</p>

		<p>She kissed the outer folds softly and blew on them with hot breath that seemed cooling to Seven because she was so hot. She opened her legs wider and begged for B'Elanna's entrance. B'Elanna complied and buried her face in Seven's wet heat. She instinctively knew what to do and sought out that bundle of nerves that she loved having caressed so much. She licked at it, sucked on it, nibbled on it and lapped at it, creating interesting patterns and eliciting approving verbal responses from her lover.</p>

		<p>The pressure in Seven's body kept building. She opened her legs wider and then crossed her ankles on B'Elanna's back. B'Elanna held on tight, keeping her hands on Seven's waist. Seven started bucking against her ministrations and B'Elanna had to work hard not to lose her place. Within seconds, Seven was screaming into the night as her hips rose in one last stand against the experience.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna eased her out of it and moved up to kiss her lover sweetly. "You are so beautiful when you come. You look like an animal," B'Elanna whispered in her ear. "I am yours."</p>

		<p>"Yes," Seven with her chest still heaving. "You are mine."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna smiled and drew Seven into her arms as she laid back on the bed. "Was that a pleasurable experience?"</p>

		<p>"Very. I will have to tell Kathryn to find a female lover. She does not know what she is missing," Seven said quietly as she traced B'Elanna's lips with her finger.</p>

		<p>"You won't tell her the details, will you?"</p>

		<p>"No. She does not want the details. I will just tell her that it was a very satisfying first time."</p>

		<p>"She'll be jealous and want to steal me from you."</p>

		<p>"But you are mine. She will not steal you."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna smiled proudly and puffed up her chest. Seven took the opportunity to begin tracing a nipple with her finger, her touch feather light.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 7">
		<p>Captain Janeway groaned as she sat back on her couch, a closed poetry book in her hands. Her door chimed.</p>

		<p>"Come in," she said, trying to adjust her voice to not reflect her less than happy mood.</p>

		<p>Ensign Nicole Lang stepped in cautiously and stood at attention just inside the door.</p>

		<p>"Ensign Lang," Janeway said, a little shocked. "What brings you this way?"</p>

		<p>"Ma'am, we have additional sensor readings on the ship we encountered." She held out a data padd, still standing at attention.</p>

		<p>"Thank you, Ensign, but that was hardly necessary. You could have given them to Commander Chakotay or to me in the morning. You didn't need to come all the way here."</p>

		<p>"I was just coming off my shift and decided to take the long walk home. Do you mind?"</p>

		<p>"Not in the least. Would you like to tell me about the report? Have a drink or something?"</p>

		<p>"I don't want to intrude."</p>

		<p>"You won't be. I invited you, didn't I?"</p>

		<p>"Yes," she said with a wide smile.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"You are so teasing me right now," B'Elanna said deep in her throat.</p>

		<p>"Is that a bad thing?" Seven asked, continuing the behavior that was teasing B'Elanna.</p>

		<p>"Right now, yes. I am so hungry!" Lanna said before she pounced on the slice of pepperoni in Seven's hand. She snatched it away and gobbled it up before Seven could even react. They were sitting in bed, eating the dinner that they had ignored before.</p>

		<p>"Now, I know you are. You'd think that you'd be hungry for me," Seven said, a fake pout on her lips.</p>

		<p>"I am hungry for you, baby. But I have to keep up my strength."</p>

		<p>"I haven't even had the chance to make you lose it yet," Seven continued.</p>

		<p>"I haven't given you a chance to make me use up my strength."</p>

		<p>Seven put their dinner aside on the night table and rolled back into Seven's embrace. She kissed B'Elanna's nose and pushed her shoulders to the bed.</p>

		<p>"You're gonna be that way about it," Lanna joked. "I see."</p>

		<p>"Be quiet."</p>

		<p>Seven brushed their noses against one another, her lips hovering above B'Elanna's in an erotic dance. B'Elanna purred lightly ran her nails up and down Seven's straight back. Seven finally kissed her, sucking her tongue into her mouth and whirling her own around it. In one movement, she opened B'Elanna's legs and fell between them. Lanna put her legs around her lover's hips and pulled her even closer.</p>

		<p>"You don't know what you do to me," Lanna said as Seven released her mouth in order to kiss down to her breasts.</p>

		<p>"I can feel what I do to you," Seven said seriously before she pounced on a pert nipple with her full lips and ecstatic tongue.</p>

		<p>Lanna moaned and gripped Seven's head to her chest. Seven smiled a little more and put her right hand between Lanna's legs. She fondled her slick nether lips and elicited another moan from her lover. She went further and established a rhythm against the ridge she found.</p>

		<p>"I love you," Seven whispered as Lanna's breath caught. The half-Klingon's short nails dug into Seven's shoulders.</p>

		<p>"Inside, Seven, please, inside."</p>

		<p>Seven complied with a kiss. She put her first two fingers inside of B'Elanna and began pumping them slowly, caressing her clitoris as she did so.</p>

		<p>"Oh, God! Kahless!" Lanna screamed into the night as her vagina gripped onto Seven's fingers and her body became rigid with orgasm. She then began to shake violently.</p>

		<p>Seven soothed her through it, cooing in her ear words of love and slowly caressing her with her hand. She soon learned to stop her hand completely, but left it in its warm cocoon. B'Elanna wouldn't let it go.</p>

		<p>It took B'Elanna a good five minutes to gain lucidity and release Seven's hand. Seven eased it out and pulled her lover close to her body. B'Elanna couldn't believe that she had just passed out. She had never passed out before. Certainly Seven hadn't done anything that out of the ordinary. Tom had done the same, more or less, and she was always left less than satisfied. What had Seven done differently?</p>

		<p>"I so love you," Seven said to B'Elanna, tracing her ridges with her fingers.</p>

		<p>&gt;That's why,' B'Elanna said.</p>

		<p>"What are you thinking about?"</p>

		<p>"About how perfect you are and how much I love you."</p>

		<p>"I am not perfect."</p>

		<p>"Pretty damn close."</p>

		<p>"How much do you love me?"</p>

		<p>"More than there are stars in all the universes in all of space."</p>

		<p>"That is a considerable amount."</p>

		<p>"It is true," B'Elanna said. She took Seven's hand in hers and kissed each fingertip and then the palm.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Are you sure about that, Nicole?" Janeway asked, her eyes firmly on Ensign Lang's face.</p>

		<p>"Yes," Lang answered seriously.</p>

		<p>"I can't believe it. I'm having a tough time trying to wrap my brain around it."</p>

		<p>"It's not something that many people understand."</p>

		<p>"But you do?"</p>

		<p>"Of course. I'm quite learned on the subject. I grew up with it, of course."</p>

		<p>"You mean to tell me that, within context..."</p>

		<p>"Yes."</p>

		<p>"Let me finish."</p>

		<p>"Sorry."</p>

		<p>"Within the context of the story, Dorothy actually went to Oz!"</p>

		<p>"Yes."</p>

		<p>"I always thought it was just a dream," Janeway said before taking another sip of wine.</p>

		<p>"See, people often think it's just a dream but people often don't remember their dreams that well. It was clearly an alternate universe. The imagery was too complete. Of course, the characters did act odd, but so did the people in the black and white world. What about the mirror universe that Benjamin Sisko spoke of before we left Deep Space Nine? It clearly is possible."</p>

		<p>"But it is only a story, once you get down to it, and it could only be written that way."</p>

		<p>"It still is very real to Dorothy, and thus cannot be a dream. It was her experience and not Auntie Em's or anybody else."</p>

		<p>"Okay," Janeway growled. "You've convinced me."</p>

		<p>Nicole laughed, snorting slightly and then covered her mouth as she realized that she snorted. Janeway laughed at her and patted her hand. That caused her to snort again and Janeway nearly fell on the floor.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry," she said as she tried to compose herself. "That was so cute. My sister does that when she's drunk."</p>

		<p>"Unfortunately, so do I. I hope I'm able to stumble home."</p>

		<p>They started to laugh again, Nicole's head falling into Janeway's lap as she slapped her knee lightly.</p>

		<p>"I haven't had so much fun in years."</p>

		<p>"Me neither," Nicole said as she wiped the tears from her eyes. She sat up and tried to compose herself, only to find when her eyes met Janeway's again, she was busting up again and so was Janeway.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Part 8">
		<p>Janeway sat at the edge of her desk, her legs crossed in front of her, looking at Tom Paris with a perplexed look on her face. She couldn't understand how such a talented young man could be such an asshole. She corrected herself. It is not right to think of your crew as assholes. However, Tom Paris was an asshole.</p>

		<p>He had been caught fighting with Chakotay this time, attacking him for no particular reason, and Chakotay was pressing charges. Janeway just couldn't understand it and knew that she would have to come up with a more proper punishment than cleaning.</p>

		<p>"Tom, I honestly don't know what to do with you. You are acting out in a most undignified way and going against many protocols that have been in place since the beginning of sailing across the open sea. You do not hit a fellow or commanding officer, ever. You have not only done that once aboard this ship, Tom, when you hit Harry, your supposed best friend, but when you just hit my second in command, Chakotay. Tell me your reasoning."</p>

		<p>"You won't understand."</p>

		<p>"Try me."</p>

		<p>"You see, you're her friend. You're both of their friends and you won't understand."</p>

		<p>"I thought that we were friends, too, Tom. But see, if they had done something like this, they would have been properly punished, too. I gave you leeway because Harry didn't press charges. I punished you by making you clean his quarters. Not too terribly difficult, but demeaning and I hoped that would send a message to you. What didn't you understand?"</p>

		<p>"It's not that... Captain, I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. There would have been other women, but she would always be there. She would be my friend and we would always have each other."</p>

		<p>"Most people don't see relationships like that, Tom. You promised to be monogamous. You were not. She ended the relationship. However, I don't see why this has anything to do with why you hit Harry and Chakotay."</p>

		<p>"They remind me of her."</p>

		<p>"How so?"</p>

		<p>"Harry wants to comfort me but all he does is remind me that B'Elanna isn't there. Chakotay, he and B'Elanna knew each other forever."</p>

		<p>"Did he say something?"</p>

		<p>"No. Just talked to me like normal."</p>

		<p>"Mr. Paris, I'm going to confine you the brig for an amount of time yet to be determined, demote you to crewman, and you must talk to a counselor."</p>

		<p>"Who?"</p>

		<p>"Yet to be determined."</p>

		<p>"Will I be able to pilot the ship as a crewman?"</p>

		<p>"No."</p>

		<p>"Dammit, Captain! That's the only thing I have left."</p>

		<p>"You had it, Crewman Paris. You need to think about your actions and behavior now. I will not allow you to continue to behave this manner while holding the alpha shift pilot rotation. Tuvok to ready room," she ended by tapping her comm badge.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, Tom chose the perfect time to fly off the handle and attack Janeway, wrapping his hands around her neck. As her eyes started to bulge out, she kneed him in the groin. He doubled over in pain and backed up straight into Tuvok. He proceeded to hold him up and take him dispassionately to the brig where he was likely to be for quite a long time.</p>

		<p>Janeway got herself a glass of water as she regained her breath and rubbed her neck. The door chimed and she croaked, "Come."</p>

		<p>Chakotay walked in, concerned by what had just happened.</p>

		<p>"Did he hurt you?"</p>

		<p>"No, only himself," she said, gaining her voice again. "I'll be damned if I ever see him on the bridge again. If he gets out of the brig, he'll be in the bowels of the ship, scraping up mold."</p>

		<p>"Revenge, Kathryn?" he asked.</p>

		<p>"No, truth. I've given him too many allowances. We need two things now, besides someone to officiate the trial. A new pilot and a counselor."</p>

		<p>"You are going to attempt to counsel him?"</p>

		<p>"I'm not. Somebody else. I think there's something not right about Tom. I don't understand his behavior. I also don't want to confine him to the brig for the rest of the journey, no matter what he has done."</p>

		<p>"Understood."</p>

		<p>"It's 1600 hrs and I'm going home. Have any suggestions for either position on my desk tomorrow morning."</p>

		<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

		<p>He followed her out of the ready room and she made a b-line for the turbolift. Ensign Nicole Lang followed her in."</p>

		<p>"Finishing your shift, Ensign?" Janeway asked.</p>

		<p>"Yes, ma'am," she said with a smile.</p>

		<p>"Good."</p>

		<p>"Captain, if I could be so forward, may I cook you dinner tonight?"</p>

		<p>"My, that is forward," Janeway said with a smile.</p>

		<p>"I try."</p>

		<p>"You may, if you call me Kathryn when we are off duty. Would your roommate mind?"</p>

		<p>"Probably. Would you provide the setting?"</p>

		<p>"Yes, I would. Come by at 1900, if you would like."</p>

		<p>"Will do, Kathryn."</p>

		<p>"Very well, Nicole," Janeway said as she exited on her deck. She turned back towards to the turbolift only to see the doors closing on a very cute smile on Nicole's face.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"I can't go any further, Seven," B'Elanna said as she fell against Seven's shoulders.</p>

		<p>"You do not have enough endurance, Lanna."</p>

		<p>"We've been doing this all day, Seven. How could I possibly endure that?"</p>

		<p>"I have endured it."</p>

		<p>"But you have enhancements that allow you to endure it. Nanoprobes."</p>

		<p>"My nanoprobes have hardly anything to do with it. I am simply in better shape than you."</p>

		<p>"We've been chasing after Naomi since 1000, she has only rested once for lunch. It is now 1700 hrs."</p>

		<p>"I will speak with her, Lanna. We will take her back to her mother so you can take a nap."</p>

		<p>"I don't need a nap, Seven! I just need to rest."</p>

		<p>"So you do not wish to lay in bed with me," Seven asked with a devilishly innocent look on her face.</p>

		<p>"Oh! Naomi, it's time to go home. You're mom will have dinner ready for you at any time," Lanna said quickly. She amazingly had enough energy again. In fact, she had enough energy to get outside the ship and push it home.</p>

		<hr/>

		<p>"Nicole, this is wonderful. What is it again?"</p>

		<p>"Mama Frizoli's Frightful Feast of Fuccini."</p>

		<p>"And what's in it?"</p>

		<p>"Too much to say. Nothing that'll kill you, though."</p>

		<p>"That's good," Kathryn said before she took another laugh. "Why didn't you take the ship's chef position when it was open?"</p>

		<p>"Neelix needed to do something. He's a good guy and he's not all that bad. People just complain too much."</p>

		<p>"But leola root?"</p>

		<p>Nicole started laughing, soft at first and when Kathryn questioned her, she laughed harder. She even snorted as Kathryn looked on with a distressed look on her face.</p>

		<p>"What is going on? Is there leola root in this food?"</p>

		<p>Nicole nodded and fell on the floor in a fit of giggles.</p>

		<p>"It doesn't even taste like it."</p>

		<p>"He... was cooking... it... wrong," Nicole sputtered, unable to get off the floor. Kathryn knelt down next to her on the floor and suddenly, Nicole turned serious. She pushed her brown hair away from her eyes and absent mindedly stroked her now exposed and very toned stomach.</p>

		<p>"Something wrong?" Kathryn asked, her voice a low timber. It sent shivers through Nicole and her breathing deepening.</p>

		<p>"No, ma'am."</p>

		<p>"Kathryn."</p>

		<p>"Kathryn, there's nothing wrong," she whispered.</p>

		<p>Janeway quirked up a corner of her mouth. Nicole took the opportunity to sit up and press her lips into the captain's. It was Janeway who made the kiss deeper, cradling Nicole's head in her hands and teasing her lips with her tongue. The need for air a moment or two later made them separate and look in each other's eyes.</p>

		<p>"Oh, my god," Kathryn said, desire clear in her voice.</p>

		<p>Nicole pulled her down for another kiss and pushed her down to the floor. It wasn't forceful, just loving. She didn't touch the captain anywhere but her waist and the top of her head, stroking her hair absentmindedly with her hand. Kathryn did the same as their lips danced in a slow, passionate ritual, their tongues playing with each other, teasing each other, not fighting each other.</p>

		<p>Kathryn moaned as Nicole pulled away and kissed her eyes and her forehead.</p>

		<p>"Did you plan on seducing me tonight?" Kathryn asked with a sexy laugh.</p>

		<p>"Yes," Nicole answered as she put her snuggled into the crook of Janeway's laugh.</p>

		<p>"Should I be worried?"</p>

		<p>"I don't know. Why would you be worried?"</p>

		<p>"That I let somebody affect me so quickly. That I let someone seduce me. What do you want from me?"</p>

		<p>"Your love. That's all."</p>

		<p>"You're asking for a lot."</p>

		<p>"Maybe, but I'm not asking for it now. I know it's very difficult for you to be involved with an ensign, although I was sure to look up any rules regarding any relationships between captains and their crew. There aren't any rules, just a general suggestion that you keep your private life separate from your professional one. I understand that completely and would never ask for any favors or extra consideration from the captain. What I'm asking is that you take a chance on me. I will take this as slowly as you want, Kathryn, but I will never lie to you and say that I'm not attracted to you."</p>

		<p>"Are you attracted to the position I have on this ship?"</p>

		<p>"I can say that I'm not, but that would be a lie. It's a part of who you are and I can't deny it. However, the last couple of days have taught me so much more about you. I can't believe how open and loving you can be. I've never heard a laugh so beautiful in my life. I am attracted to you, Kathryn Janeway, who happens to be the captain of this ship."</p>

		<p>"And you are an ensign."</p>

		<p>"Yes, but someday I'll be captain of my own vessel. You may be an admiral, but I will be a captain. Experience will get me there, as well as a job well done, but that can only happen when we get home. I don't want your job. I don't want anymore consideration that you would give any other person aboard this vessel."</p>

		<p>"You are very well spoken."</p>

		<p>"You are skirting the issue. Are you attracted to me?"</p>

		<p>"Yes, very much so," Kathryn purred.</p>

		<p>Nicole smiled and then leaned down and kissed Kathryn again, passionately. She held her close by placing a strong hand on the captain's hip. The captain ground her hips into Nicole's. They both felt the desire building inside of them, so much so that they felt the earth shake beneath them. When the red lights poured down on them and the klaxon's started sounding, they soon learned that it wasn't the passion, but the ship being attacked and put under red alert.</p>
