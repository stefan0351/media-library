<!-- New Frontier \ Part 14 -->

		Kathryn woke to a softness beneath her cheek and a wonderful new scent teasing her senses.</p>

		<p>"I could get used to this," she murmured as her forefinger traced patterns on her soon to be lover's exposed stomach. "I love you," she whispered.</p>

		<p>Kathryn felt infinitely better this morning than she had the night before. No tears stained her face, they had been gently washed away by love's kisses. She felt safe, protected, solid, and human all at the same time. She kissed Nicole's covered breast and was amazed at the peak that arose in the middle. She grazed her forefinger over it, further amazed that Nicole hadn't woken up yet.</p>

		<p>"Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me," she said quietly, reciting a Stephen Foster poem. Nicole's chest rose with the first breath of morning, soothing Kathryn even more.</p>

		<p>"Good morning," Kathryn purred.</p>

		<p>"Good morning," Nicole said.</p>

		<p>"Thanks for staying last night," she said.</p>

		<p>"Back to niceties? You cried on my shoulder last night and are now caressing my breast," Nicole joked.</p>

		<p>"I believe in being polite."</p>

		<p>"Then, I have a question for you."</p>

		<p>"Okay. Go ahead, Ensign."</p>

		<p>"So cruel. May I kiss you, Captain?"</p>

		<p>"May I kiss you, Captain what?"</p>

		<p>"May I kiss you, Captain, please," Nicole said, pleading mocked in her voice.</p>

		<p>"You may."</p>

		<p>Nicole shimmied down the bed so that she was eye level with her love. She teased Janeway's lips with the tip of her tongue, not actually touching her. When Kathryn got frustrated, she reeled her tongue in and smiled. When she hesitated, Kathryn drew close and pressed her lips to Nicole's.</p>

		<p>Tongues teased lips and teeth and each other while hands held each other, grasping and releasing each other in a dance of love. Their lips released each other and they were breathing heavily and smiling.</p>

		<p>"I'm so in love with you, Kathryn."</p>

		<p>Kathryn smiled wider and kissed the young woman. "I love you, too."</p>

		<p>Nicole laughed and pushed Kathryn back to the bed. She put her mouth to the pulse point on her neck and sucked gently. Kathryn trusted her, knowing that she wouldn't give her a hickey only to be hidden or healed later.</p>

		<p>Kathryn's hands ran up and down Nicole's back just under her shirt. Her skin was so smooth, silk and satin at the same time, with strong muscles hidden just beneath.</p>

		<p>"Oh, Nikki," Kathryn groaned, already taking the liberty that only a loved one could take, shortening her name. </p>

		<p>>Nikki' kissed further down her lover's body, pushing down her nightgown as she went. When Kathryn's breasts were revealed, she carefully avoided the quickly hardening tips, opting instead to kiss the fleshy mound around it. Kathryn's hips lifted into the air and Nicole took that opportunity to push the nightgown completely off.</p>

		<p>"You're suddenly overdressed," Kathryn breathed.</p>

		<p>"Let me take care of you," was all that Nicole said before she finally put her lips to Kathryn's aching nipple.</p>

		<p>Nicole made love to Kathryn softly, gently, making her call out to the stars in wild abandon. It was the most beautiful sound in the world to Nicole. After hours of being made love to, Kathryn laid back, sated. Her mind was reeling.</p>

		<p>The lovers held each other close, their breath mingling as their mouths were not more than millimeters apart. It took Kathryn another hour before she could repay the debt, complaining that Nicole was too good. She then proved to Nicole that she was just as good and wouldn't stop until Nicole pushed her away or passed out because of her passion.</p>

		Seven awoke to the pleasant smell of her lover filling her senses. She heard the double beat in her ear and her own heartbeat matched it. She was alive and so was B'Elanna. She smiled and squeezed B'Elanna close. B'Elanna moaned and smiled down at the love of her life.</p>

		<p>"You're a sight for sore eyes," Lanna said.</p>

		<p>"Are your eyes sore?"</p>

		<p>"Not anymore." B'Elanna eased Seven back onto her biobed and moved hers out of the way.</p>

		<p>"I wanted to hold onto you longer," Seven pouted.</p>

		<p>"You can hold onto me for the rest of your life," B'Elanna replied. She urged Seven to sit on the edge of the bed and then knelt down in front of her. "Seven, Annika Hansen..." she started to cry, "I love you so much, and I want to give you my love, my hearts, my soul to you for all of my days and beyond. Will you marry me?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, B'Elanna," Seven said as she slipped off the bed and put her arms around B'Elanna's neck.</p>

		<p>"Please say yes, Seven. I don't want to live without you. I can't live without you."</p>

		<p>"Yes, B'Elanna Marie Torres, I will marry you."</p>

		<p>They kissed as the Doctor looked on, crying holographic tears. All was well in the ship called Voyager.</p>
