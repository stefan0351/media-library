<!-- New Frontier \ Part 10 -->

<p>Kathryn Janeway awoke with a heavy weight on her chest and a hand holding hers. Her head was throbbing and her vision was fuzzy. She was able to see well enough, however, to notice a mass of short brown hair covering the shape of a head resting on her chest. She reached up and stroked the hair, remembering how it felt from before.</p>

		<p>"Nicole," she said hoarsely.</p>

		<p>Ensign Lang woke up slowly, turning her face towards Kathryn, but not really lifting her head. She breathed in and wiped the drool from her mouth, revealing a smile afterward.</p>

		<p>"Hi," she replied, finally sitting up only to stroke Kathryn's hair.</p>

		<p>"Hi," Kathryn said. "What happened?"</p>

		<p>"You hit your head on the deck. You have a concussion. You've been out for twenty hours."</p>

		<p>"Oh, that would explain the headache. Can I have some water?"</p>

		<p>"You may," the Doc said as he appeared with tricorder in hand. "Ensign Lang."</p>

		<p>Nicole stood and walked to the replicator, ordering a glass of cool water.</p>

		<p>"You had us worried there for a while, Captain. Thanks to my amazing medical abilities, however, you are nearly healed." He pressed a hypospray to her neck, releasing a pain killer for her headache. "I know how you hate to stay in sickbay, so I'll release you to your quarters. You aren't allowed to leave until at least two days from now and you must wear this cortical monitor." He affixed the monitor to her neck behind her ear. "You must rest that entire time. Since Ensign Lang has been here the entire time and has shown a propensity for medicine. I'd like to start training her for the assistant's position left open after Mr. Paris's absence. It is because of that, and she as accepted, that she monitor your health from your quarters. I will check up on you twice, but I will trust that Nicole will be sufficient enough to take care of you for the time being. You must listen to her for I have given her specific instructions."</p>

		<p>Janeway looked from the doctor to Nicole as her eyebrows raised up her forehead. Nicole just smiled. Janeway took the water from Nicole and gulped it down.</p>

		<p>"Much better."</p>

		<p>"Do I have your promise, Captain?"</p>

		<p>"That I follow Nicole's instructions, sure. Can I have some clothes now?"</p>

		<p>Nicole handed her a pile of clothes: a t-shirt, Starfleet sweat pants, and underwear. She smiled and turned away, nearly skipping to the doc's office to finish putting together her supplies.</p>

		<p>"Oh, god," Kathryn said.</p>

		<p>"Captain, I don't know what you're getting into..."</p>

		<p>"Don't start, Doctor."</p>

		<p>"I think she can be good for you."</p>

		<p>Kathryn's eyebrows raised up her forehead and she was reminded of her headache, dissipating but still there. She went to the bathroom and changed into the clothes that Nicole had brought her. She found it difficult because her muscles were stiff. She fought hard not to cry out, but still managed to do so. Nicole burst into the room to see Kathryn undressed with one leg in her panties and one leg out. It was undignified, for sure, but Kathryn couldn't get out of it. She was nearly in tears.</p>

		<p>"Oh, Kathryn," Nicole said, rushing to her side and helping her to the side of the tub.</p>

		<p>"I can't lift my leg," she said weakly.</p>

		<p>"I've got you," Nicole said. She finished dressing Kathryn without another word. She was incredibly gentle. When she was done, she helped Kathryn back to her quarters and laid her down.</p>

		<p>"I hurt all over."</p>

		<p>"I know."</p>

		<p>Nicole took Kathryn's sweatpants off and then her bra, still keeping her shirt and panties on. She then began to massage her body, starting at her feet and moving up slowly as each muscle loosened. It wasn't sexual, but very loving, very gentle. By the time Nicole had reached Kathryn's shoulders, the captain was asleep. Nicole smiled and covered her with the sheets and blanket. She slept on the fainting couch across from the bed.</p>

		Seven walked into engineering and stood behind B'Elanna, silently, perfectly still, until B'Elanna turned around with a start, running her face straight into Seven's bosom.</p>

		<p>"Oh, Seven, you scared me," B'Elanna said as she patted Seven's forearm.</p>

		<p>"I have that effect on people," Seven said with a slight curl to her lips.</p>

		<p>"Not much anymore. When you were Borg, yes, now not so much," B'Elanna said as she typed some commands into one of the computer stations. Seven noticed what she was doing and helped her from another console.</p>

		<p>"I still am Borg. I still scare some people."</p>

		<p>"You are only part Borg, and most of the people on this ship know that you aren't going to hurt them. Most of you is human, though."</p>

		<p>Seven looked silently to the console and worked, not wanting to respond to B'Elanna.</p>

		<p>"It still bothers you, doesn't it?"</p>

		<p>"It does," Seven replied. "Every part of my body reminds me of my life with the Borg, if you want to call it that. I am reminded of the life that I have missed, of the people that are no longer around me, my parents. I never had brothers or sisters. I could have had them if my parents had not gone out in search of the Borg."</p>

		<p>"But you would have never come aboard Voyager and met Naomi and the Captain or eat Neelix's leola root stew or play Velocity or Kadis Kot or helped as many people as you have. You would not have met me," B'Elanna said, putting her hand on top of her lover's.</p>

		<p>"I know. That is the only thing that made my time with the Borg worth it."</p>

		<p>"I can't say that we can't change the past because our dealings with the future and past have proved that theory wrong. The only thing I can say is that you should let go of you and your parents' past mistakes and live life for the moment. It took me a while to learn that, and I still have a great deal of trouble with it, but I've accepted it. It's the only way to live your life."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna gave Seven a small smile and caressed her cheek.</p>

		<p>"I love you," Seven said quietly.</p>

		<p>"I love you, too. Let's go out to dinner tonight."</p>

		<p>"Where?"</p>

		<p>"Harry programmed a new holo restaurant on the holodeck. It's a pizzeria from the 20th century. I haven't seen it yet, but I'm sure it's good. Have you ever had pizza?"</p>

		<p>"No, I have not. Naomi keeps trying to get me to eat it, but I am never hungry when we play."</p>

		<p>"Let's take her tonight. Would you like to take her?"</p>

		<p>"That would be nice," Seven replied with a huge smile.</p>

		<p>"Good. I'll pick you up at 1800 hrs. Okay?"</p>

		<p>"Okay. I must get back to Astrometrics now."</p>

		<p>"Thank you for your help."</p>

		<p>"Anything for you," Seven said quietly before she left. On her way to her post, she contacted Naomi and asked her about that evening. She became very excited and said that she would be in the Cargo Bay at fifteen minutes before 1800. Seven disagreed and told her that they would pick her up at her quarters. Naomi groaned a little, but finally acquiesced. Seven had to smile at that.</p>

		B'Elanna showed up in cargo bay 2 right on time, which was a feat in itself for her, carrying one brilliant red rose without thorns. It was meant to remind Seven how much B'Elanna loved her and how she would never hurt Seven.</p>

		<p>Seven reacted to her like every time she saw the half Klingon. Her heart beat a little faster. A smile crept up on her face. Her knees felt weak. She put her arms around B'Elanna and kissed her cheek, unmindful of the rose the love of her life carried for her.</p>

		<p>"Hi," B'Elanna said shyly.</p>

		<p>"You are blushing, B'Elanna."</p>

		<p>"You are shaking, Seven."</p>

		<p>"Why are we acting this way?"</p>

		<p>"I think it's because this is our first date."</p>

		<p>"But it is hardly our first day. We have had dinner before and made love several times over. Why do you think this is our first date?"</p>

		<p>"Our first date amongst real people. It's kind of a declaration."</p>

		<p>"Does that scare you?"</p>

		<p>"A little. I mean Tom dated other women in front of everybody while we were married. I don't want to shove it in his face. I'm not like that."</p>

		<p>"There is no need to worry, B'Elanna. Mr. Paris forfeited his right to be jealous of us. He attacked both Chakotay and the captain. He is now in the brig awaiting an investigation, trial, and most likely, a court martial."</p>

		<p>"Why wasn't I told?"</p>

		<p>"It happened very quickly, B'Elanna. I only learned of it because of a discussion with Chakotay."</p>

		<p>"Why were you talking to him?"</p>

		<p>"I submitted my departmental report to him in the captain's absence. Are you jealous?"</p>

		<p>"No, yes. I don't know. I guess that I'm jealous that you know more gossip than I do." B'Elanna smiled. Seven leaned down and kissed her chastely.</p>

		<p>"You are cute when you are jealous. But there is no need to be. You have been isolating yourself in your work and your only contact with the outside world is me. You are not talking with your contacts."</p>

		<p>"I guess I have been, but that's what tonight is about, right?"</p>

		<p>"Right. Let's go get Naomi."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna smiled and they left the cargo bay, hand in hand, headed for the Wildman quarters. Several people looked at them as they passed, but neither noticed. They were too focused on each other. When they finally got to the quarters Naomi shared with her mom, they were surprised at how they got there. Of course, they had intended to go there but they didn't consciously walk there.</p>

		<p>Seven rang the chime and Naomi appeared at the door. She ran out, ignoring her mother's wishes for her to be home by 2200 hours. B'Elanna said that they'd have her home by then and started chasing after the feisty child. Seven followed them, running as well. Finally, they reached the turbolift and stopped inside.</p>

		<p>"What's the deal, Spike? Why were you running from your mom?"</p>

		<p>"She was starting to lecture me on the importance of eating healthy," Naomi said. "Meaning, no pizza."</p>

		<p>"You're kidding me!"</p>

		<p>"No."</p>

		<p>"Pizza contains all of the major food groups, carbos, dairy, meat, vegetables. What more could she want?" B'Elanna said, teasing the little girl.</p>

		<p>"She says that it's fattening."</p>

		<p>"That's what makes it taste good," B'Elanna said, nudging her shoulder with a gentle fist.</p>

		<p>"My stomach does not handle fat well," Seven said.</p>

		<p>"It's okay. There's not a lot of fat. Just enough to make it taste good," B'Elanna said, laughing with Naomi.</p>

		<p>When the lift doors opened, they walked to the holodeck, stopping when they heard how load it was inside.</p>

		<p>"I may sit this one out," Seven said, turning around.</p>
