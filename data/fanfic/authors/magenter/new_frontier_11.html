<!-- New Frontier \ Part 11 -->

<p>"Oh, no you don't," B'Elanna said, holding onto her arm with one hand and tapping in the entrance code with the other. And there it was a fifties style pizzeria complete with Potsie, Al, and the Fonz, not to mention the most heavenly smell of pizza coming from the kitchen and all around. Lanna was elated.</p>

		<p>"I think I am experiencing sensory overload," Seven said, watching Naomi run off to meet Harry who was sitting with Chakotay and Neelix in the corner booth.</p>

		<p>"You'll be fine," Lanna said, squeezing her hand. "Let's sit at that table next to the guys. They look like they're having fun."</p>

		<p>Seven sat uneasily across from B'Elanna. She twitched slightly at all of the noise and light in her face. B'Elanna noticed this and sensed that Seven wouldn't be getting used to the sensory overload any time soon.</p>

		<p>"Harry, can you decrease the volume?" B'Elanna said.</p>

		<p>"Sure." Harry nodded and fooled with the individual jukebox at their table. The volume of the program went down, but Seven's unease didn't decrease in the slightest.</p>

		<p>"Are you okay, Seven?" Chakotay asked.</p>

		<p>"I do not know," Seven said. Her eyes couldn't stay focused.</p>

		<p>"Is it the lights, Seven?" Harry asked and then immediately stopped the varying of the lights. Still, no change. Her left arm abruptly shot out and broke the table in half.</p>

		<p>"Seven, what's wrong?" B'Elanna asked as she took hold of Seven's arm so that it wouldn't hurt anybody. Her preventative action was useless since Seven's arm threw her off into a set of chairs and tables.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna, I'm sorry!" Seven screamed. "I cannot control myself." She spasmed uncontrollably while the crew was helpless looking on. B'Elanna made a run for Seven and jumped her, pushing her to the floor.</p>

		<p>"Seven, calm down," B'Elanna said calmly.</p>

		<p>"I cannot."</p>

		<p>"Kill her!" an unknown ensign called from the peanut gallery.</p>

		<p>"No!" B'Elanna screamed. She stood and threw Seven over her shoulder, putting her on the floor and hoping that would calm her. It didn't have the desired effect. The Doctor appeared out of nowhere with a hypospray. He pressed it to Seven's neck and she passed out. B'Elanna remained on top of her, now hoping that her weight would comfort her lover.</p>

		<p>"What's wrong with her?" Chakotay asked.</p>

		<p>"Well, if Lt. Torres would disembark, I could tell you."</p>

		<p>"Sorry," B'Elanna said as she rolled off, keeping hold of Seven's hand. "Go ahead."</p>

		<p>"Thank you for your permission, Lieutenant."</p>

		<p>The Doctor scanned the prone Seven of Nine with his tricorder and hmmmed and hawed. </p>

		<p>"Doctor?" Chakotay asked.</p>

		<p>"She has suffered from an electromagnetic pulse."</p>

		<p>"The same kind that we used on the pirate ship," Chakotay said quietly. "Where did it come from?"</p>

		<p>Harry went to the nearest wall console and typed in a couple of commands.</p>

		<p>"From outside the ship, Commander."</p>

		<p>"Bridge, scan for cloaked vessels," Chakotay said with a tap of his comm badge. He wasted no time in making his way to the bridge.</p>

		<p>"Cloaked ship detected. They are decloaking, sir," the ensign in control of Ops said as Chakotay appeared on the bridge.</p>

		<p>"Shields!" Chakotay ordered.</p>

		<p>"They are charging weapons," Tuvok said from his post.</p>

		<p>"Attention crew, battle stations. Charge weapons. Fire at their shield generators and weapons," Chakotay said from the captain's chair. " Engage."</p>

		<p>"No effect," Tuvok said.</p>

		<p>"Kim and Lange to the bridge. Torres to engineering."</p>

		<p>"Aye, sir," the first two said as they stepped off the turbolift.</p>

		<p>"Chakotay, I need to stay with Seven," B'Elanna said through her comm badge.</p>

		<p>"You can be of more help to her from engineering. That's an order, Lieutenant."</p>

		<p>"Aye, sir," she said before she ran off to her station.</p>

		<p>

		"Doc, how's Seven?" Naomi said, sticking close to the EMH and keeping an eye on Seven just as B'Elanna had told her. B'Elanna also knew that Naomi would be the safest in the sickbay and also might be able to get supplies for the doctor.</p>

		<p>"She is stable, Miss Wildman. Please pick a corner," the Doctor said, fretting over Seven still.</p>

		<p>"I will if you tell me how she is really," Naomi said as she stood her ground.</p>

		<p>"Fine. Her systems are in a state of flux. They are not operating properly and her nanoprobes are not compensating."</p>

		<p>"That's bad," Naomi said as she stood back.</p>

		<p>"Yes. But she will be fine. She is stable for the moment." Just then, the sickbay started filling up with wounded. The Doctor set up a stool for Naomi and thrust a tricorder in her hands. "Keep an eye on her, Naomi. If she changes at all, tell me."</p>

		<p>"Yes, sir," she said.</p>

		<p>

		<p>Meanwhile, in engineering, all havoc was breaking loose. B'Elanna didn't have time to worry about Seven. She had too many other things to worry about. She had to find more power somewhere to power force fields around the hull breaches on the various decks. There were many of them and she had to keep the fields up for just long enough to get the decks sealed off. Fortunately, she didn't need the power for that long since the crew was very experienced at evacuating decks.</p>

		<p>"Torres, gather all available power to the engines and maneuvering thrusters."</p>

		<p>B'Elanna did as she was told. There was no time to question the commander's orders, judging from the tone in his voice. A moment later, the ship was rolling and spiraling, doing tricks that she didn't think her ship was capable of doing. When the rolling stopped, an explosion rocked the ship and they were dead in the water.</p>

		"Enemy ship destroyed," Tuvok said.</p>

		<p>"Damage?" the captain asked as she appeared on the bridge. "I may be a bit late, but I'm not going home at a time like this."</p>

		<p>"Hull breaches on decks twelve through fifteen."</p>

		<p>"Send repair crews. Casualties?"</p>

		<p>"A few wounded, no deaths," Harry reported. "Transporters off line, shields down to 33%, torpedoes off line."</p>

		<p>"At least they waited until after the fight to go down," Chakotay said as he gave up the captain's chair for her. She sat down and looked at the back of Tal Celes' head. She was happily piloting the ship and trying to get some systems on line while she did so.</p>

		<p>"Sensors?"</p>

		<p>"On line. No ships within range."</p>

		<p>"How is Seven?" Janeway finally asked.</p>
