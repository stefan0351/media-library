		"Captain, intership transport active," Nicole said from the secondary Ops station.</p>

		<p>"From where, Nicole?" Janeway asked</p>

		<p>"From the ship bay to the brig. It's Tom. He's transported to the Delta Flyer," Nicole explained. "He's started disembarking procedures."</p>

		<p>"Lock the bay doors, Tuvok," Kathryn barked.</p>

		<p>"Unable to comply. Locked out of bay controls."</p>

		<p>"Try again! I do not want him off this ship! I do not want to lose that ship!"</p>

		<p>"He did build it, Captain."</p>

		<p>"He doesn't own it, Commander," Janeway said icily.</p>

		<p>"I would think that you are more concerned about the Flyer than Mr. Paris."</p>

		<p>"I am concerned about both," Janeway said.</p>

		<p>"He's out of the bay," Harry said. "He's got control of the sickbay."</p>

		<p>"Hail him."</p>

		<p>"Responding."</p>

		<p>"Tom, you've got to stop this. You won't survive out there."</p>

		<p>"I won't survive in there."</p>

		<p>"What are you doing in sickbay?"</p>

		<p>"Getting rid of that blonde bitch."</p>

		<p>"Get a tractor on him and gain control of sickbay," she said to Chakotay. "Nicole, get down there and help the doctor out."</p>

		<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

		<p>"Yes, ma'am," Tom mocked. "Is she your bitch now?"</p>

		<p>"Tom, stop this now! I'm not above firing phasers at you."</p>

		<p>"You wouldn't destroy this ship."</p>

		<p>"I would if it would stop you. I hate to say this, Mr. Paris, but you are proving yourself an enemy of this ship. Your behavior is out of line," she said, concern touching her force ten discipline voice and stare.</p>

		<p>"It's your behavior that's out of line!" Tom barked back. "You brought that Borg on this ship and she stole my wife!"</p>

		<p>"This isn't about Seven anymore! This is about you hurting this crew and generally screwing up your entire career and life."</p>

		<p>"I don't care about that anymore."</p>

		<p>"That much is clear."</p>

		<p>"He's powering warp engines. Electric stream still active in sickbay," Tuvok said.</p>

		<p>"Lang to the bridge, he's electrocuting Seven. You've gotta stop him."</p>

		<p>"Tom, you're killing her!"</p>

		<p>"Good."</p>

		<p>"Comm link off! Power phasers, disable his systems."</p>

		<p>"Aye, Captain," Tuvok said. It took several phaser shots to disable the Delta Flyer, weapons, communications and all.</p>

		<p>"Electric stream not affected," Nicole said. "Captain, when you get a minute."</p>

		<p>"I'll be down, Nicole," Janeway said, not liking the somber tone in her voice.</p>

		<p>"Ready for impact," Chakotay said.</p>

		<p>"Fire torpedoes. Blow the fucker up," Janeway said as she exited the bridge.</p>

		Naomi looked on in horror as a white lightening bolt hit Seven's chest.</p>

		<p>"Seven!" she screamed.</p>

		<p>"Seven!" the Doctor screamed as he hopped on top of Seven, trying to block the bolt with his body. It didn't work. The bolt kept coming and electrocuting Seven.</p>

		<p>Nicole came at that time and shot out where the bolt was coming from with a phaser. It only made the electricity come faster and more powerfully.</p>

		<p>"Doctor, get off!"</p>

		<p>"Gotta block her," he replied with strain evident in his voice.</p>

		<p>"Naomi, go to the Doctor's office!"</p>

		<p>"I wanna stay!"</p>

		<p>"Go!"</p>

		<p>Naomi complied, but complied slowly.</p>

		<p>"Doctor, now!" She took hold of his arm and yanked him off. She then contacted the bridge and told them what was going on, trying her best to block the electricity as she did so. It was nearly impossible, but she was able to deflect some of the energy.</p>

		<p>She called the captain again and then felt an explosion from outside the ship. She knew that Tom was dead at that time. Janeway was there a second later.</p>

		<p>"No!" Janeway screamed as she saw Seven arch up and down off the bed from the electricity bolt. She ran to her side and yanked her off the table. The bolt didn't follow and Nicole was able to turn it off finally.</p>

		<p>"You can't leave me now!" Janeway said. "I'm supposed to go first! Don't do this, Seven. Annika! Please stay." Kathryn cried, unconcerned about looking weak now. She wanted to save her friend, nay, her daughter. She stroked Seven's hair as the Doctor examined her on the floor.</p>

		<p>"She's gone," the Doctor said mournfully just as B'Elanna came into the sickbay. She fell to Seven's side and held her close as Kathryn put her forehead to Seven's bare stomach.</p>

		<p>"She's not supposed to go yet," Kathryn said over and over again.</p>

		<p>"Bang'wI, stay with me. You aren't going to die on me. Come on, baby."</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna she's gone," Nicole said as she placed her hand on the Klingon's shoulder.</p>

		<p>"NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!"</p>

		<p>The two women and one little girl who loved Seven most howled, making Kahless himself both proud and jealous at the strength of their voices. It reverberated throughout the ship.</p>

		<p>The Doctor looked on helplessly, keeping one eye on the tricorder, and the other on the women. Within a second, something the tricorder said made both eyes turn to it and a puzzled look appeared on his face.</p>
