<p>**Sometimes having a Slayer for your older sister sucks big time. Like, last
week she sort of saved me from this blonde vampire that she used to go to
school with, which I admit might have been slightly my fault, and now she
has this big hold over me. "If you don't do as I tell you, I'll tell mom you
let a vampire in the house and got yourself kidnapped."</p>

<p>It's not fair. I mean, it's not like mom hasn't done exactly the same thing
before. If they knew . . .</p>

<p>There's one good thing though. Buffy moves out today. She's going back to
college so she's moving onto the campus with Willow. She's really cool.
Willow can do spells, and hack into FBI files and all sorts of really neat
stuff. And she actually likes books. How did she get to be friends with
Buffy if she's so smart? Last night I told mom that I wished I had a friend
like Willow, but she got really quiet and make me go to bed. Guess it's the
whole witch thing. Her generation isn't cool with that stuff.**</p>

<p>Buffy put the last box down with a groan and straightened up, massaging her
aching back, to survey the mess. "Why is it, Will," she asked, "that every
time we move we have more stuff?"</p>

<p>The redheaded witch looked up from the box she was pulling books out of and
winced at the jumble of stuff everywhere. "I think we just naturally
accumulate stuff. We're hoarders."</p>

<p>"Ok, that didn't make me feel like a hamster," Buffy muttered, pouting.</p>

<p>Grinning, Willow stood and walked over to her girlfriend. "I meant that in a
good way."</p>

<p>She cupped Buffy's face in her both her hands and pulled her into a
leisurely kiss. As soon as Willow's soft lips touched hers, Buffy sighed and
surrendered to it. For a while she just enjoyed the sensation of being so
close to the redhead, feeling the warmth radiating off her and the soft
curves that pressed up against hers. Buffy closed her eyes and returned the
kiss gently, nibbling at one full lip before soothing it with her lips and
moaning gently when she felt Willow's arms move from her face to her
shoulders. She rested her hands on the witch's waist and pulled her closer,
hooking her fingers into the convenient belt loops she found to hold her
there.</p>

<p>Too soon, Willow was pulling back and smiling shakily, her face flushed and
looking, to Buffy, more beautiful than she could ever remember.</p>

<p>"Mm, I've missed this," the redhead sighed.</p>

<p>"Uh-huh," Buffy agreed, her mind not yet processing higher thought
processes.</p>

<p>"Guess we should get back to work then."</p>

<p>"Mm-hmm."</p>

<p>Willow started to pull away but Buffy tightened her arms around her
girlfriend's waist.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to unpack?" she pouted, and Buffy decided then and there
that taking things slowly was not going to be easy.</p>

<p>She reached forward and lightly nipped Willow's sticking out lip before
reluctantly releasing her. "I guess we should try and get stuff organized."</p>

<p>"Good Buffy," Willow said absently, already heading towards an open box of
books on slightly wobbly legs.</p>

<p>Huffing, Buffy looked down at the box she had put down a few minutes ago. It
was large, cardboardy and full, she was sure, of non-thrilling bathroom
equipment. Certainly nothing she could get waylaid by and accidentally not
do any unpacking. Very, very unlikely to be weapons, or even one of the
Slaying books Giles had given her to read. Glaring at it, she reluctantly
took it into the bathroom and began putting things away.</p>

<p>Classes were due to begin in a couple of days so they would not have long to
get settled before the drudgery of college restarted. The dorm room had
actually been available for a month, but Joyce was still not happy about
their new relationship so she had put a strict veto on the idea of them
moving in any sooner. The small fact that it was one room, with a bathroom
and a small kitchen area, but still essentially only one room probably had a
lot to do with it, Buffy reflected as she put toothpaste and toothbrushes
into the medicine cabinet. By the time they started looking around Sunnydale
for somewhere to live, all the good places were gone and the rest of the
apartments were of the 'would not house Spike in them' league of general
icky-ness. There was definitely nothing available that had two rooms so that
Joyce could happily pretend that there was nothing going on.</p>

<p>It had occurred to Buffy before that her mother preferred denial to
knowledge, but this was getting ridiculous. Joyce did not want Dawn knowing
what was going on, probably thinking that the younger girl might get ideas,
and did her best to make sure that Buffy and Willow were never alone
together. Being back in the dorm was the best thing to happen in a long
time.</p>

<p>Buffy had emptied her box so she went back into the main room for another.
Only to find Willow with her nose in a book, the box she was supposedly
working on abandoned on the floor next to her.</p>

<p>"Uh, Will?" Buffy said, grinning as the witch jumped guiltily.</p>

<p>"I wasn't reading!" she exclaimed, hiding the book behind her back.</p>

<p>"Of course you weren't." Somehow, Buffy managed to keep a straight face.
"How do you feel about pizza? Followed by ice-cream sundaes."</p>

<p>Moving with astonishing speed, Willow was at Buffy's side tugging on her
hand. "You mean it?"</p>

<p>"Will, do I ever joke about pizza?"</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Replete, and relaxed at having put the unpacking off for a few more hours,
Buffy and Willow walked up the hall to their room hand in hand.</p>

<p>"Ampata," Buffy said.</p>

<p>"Bezoar."</p>

<p>"Catherine the Witch."</p>

<p>"Der Kindestod."</p>

<p>"El Eliminate."</p>

<p>"Fyarl demon."</p>

<p>Buffy snorted. "Not allowed. I didn't actually defeat that one."</p>

<p>"You made it go away," Willow protested, unlocking their door.</p>

<p>"Yeah, because I made Ethan turn it back into Giles. Doesn't count."</p>

<p>Willow pouted. "You did stab it-"</p>

<p>"Give it up, Will. It was 'The Alphabet of Defeated Monsters', not 'The
Alphabet of Monsters Buffy made go away'. That doesn't count."</p>

<p>"Spoil sport."</p>

<p>The two girls looked hopelessly at the scene of destruction that was their
new home.</p>

<p>Buffy peaked hopefully at her partner. "We could..."</p>

<p>"Clear everything onto the floor and unpack tomorrow?"</p>

<p>The blonde grinned. "You read my mind."</p>

<p>"I'm a witch. It's what we do."</p>

<p>Buffy paused with a box suspended part way between the bed and the floor,
feeling a chill pass over her at a horrifying thought. "You didn't..."</p>

<p>Willow rolled her eyes. "Buff, I was kidding. I can't read your mind."</p>

<p>"Phew." Buffy sighed and put the box down, wincing when she saw the
speculative look in her love's eyes.</p>

<p>"Why? Is there something I should know? Or not know?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"Nope, nothing. Absolutely nothing."</p>

<p>One red eyebrow lifted.</p>

<p>"I mean it, Will. There's nothing." Thinking quickly, Buffy grinned. "My
mind is a place that no one in their right mind would want to visit."</p>

<p>She did not wait for Willow to process that, instead throwing the pillow she
conveniently found in her hand directly at the redhead. That earned her a
mock growl and the pillow returned quickly, straight into her face. For a
while afterwards nothing was heard apart from muffled thuds and giggles.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"If you get the apartment this'll be your hallway," Willow said excitedly.</p>

<p>She was walking down the aforementioned hallway hand in hand with Buffy,
grinning happily. Xander and Anya walked a little ahead of the couple, the
former demon's arm still in a sling, and the witch was slightly stunned that
things were actually starting to turn out well for a change. She and Buffy
had finally been able to move in together, despite Joyce's objections, their
room was starting to look more homey and less like and bombsite and Xander
had sprung the apartment hunting on them early that morning. Xander was
actually going to get an apartment of his own. This was a day she never
thought would come.</p>

<p>"We'll walk down this hall, and we'll say 'la la, I'm on my way to Xander's'
," she continued, grinning.</p>

<p>"Just warning you, Xander, I probably won't be doing that," Buffy told him,
grinning almost as widely as her redheaded partner.</p>

<p>"Hey, we're just looking," Xander said. "Rent's way high, so don't get your
hopes all carbonated."</p>

<p>"But you have references," Anya protested.</p>

<p>"No, I have Albert, which is just me doing an important voice." Xander put
on an 'important' voice. "Xander Harris? An excellent tenant, and a very
fine-looking fellow."</p>

<p>The couple stopped and Anya opened the door in front of her, Willow and
Buffy following her into the apartment. Willow's eyes bugged out a little as
she saw it.</p>

<p>"Whoa! Big!" she said, trying to keep the awe out of her voice.  Why was
there nothing like this when they were looking for a place to live?</p>

<p>"It's nice," Buffy said uncertainly. "And not subterranean. It's very, uh,
above-terrenean."</p>

<p>Willow noticed that Xander was looking a little less thrilled, and a little
green around the edges.</p>

<p>"I want it," Anya announced. "Pay anything."</p>

<p>"Xander Harris?"</p>

<p>The witch was startled to see someone else in the apartment that she had not
noticed before. She nearly pulled her hand out of Buffy's, before mentally
slapping herself. Sometimes, it was hard not to feel uncomfortable but this
was a public display of affection in front of someone she did not know.
Admittedly, a small PDA, possibly so small the dark haired woman walking
towards them wouldn't notice, but still...she steeled herself and smiled up
at Buffy before turning her attention back to Xander.</p>

<p>"Hey," he said, wiping his hard on his shirt and holding it out.</p>

<p>The real-estate manager shook hands gingerly.</p>

<p>"I brought my friends," Xander said, indicating Buffy and Willow.</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>Somehow, Willow got the feeling that the manager was not impressed with them
all.</p>

<p>"They wouldn't always be here," added Xander.</p>

<p>"But we're clean and-and quiet," Willow said brightly, trying to find
something to say that would stop the manager giving her friend such odd
looks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Anya had moved into the living area and was looking around with
love in her eyes. "We can have the Scooby meetings in the living room,
and-and Giles can explain the boring things over there."</p>

<p>Poking around in the kitchen, Willow found and a microwave and turned to
Buffy with a smile. "Oh, there's a microwave! It would be like having our
own hot and cold running popcorn."</p>

<p>The manager, probably sensing that the meeting was getting out of her
control, ran through the apartment's advantages. "Phone and electricity are
hooked up, there's a private balcony, ceiling fan, closet space..."</p>

<p>Xander opened a door.</p>

<p>"...And that's the bedroom. I brought an application form for you to fill
out."</p>

<p>He took the piece of paper that was offered to him, eyeing it cautiously.
"An application? I can't just tell you my references. Because there's
Albert."</p>

<p>"We run your credit check based on the application," the manager told him.</p>

<p>"Oh! Credit check. Little check on the credit. See how credible my checks
are."</p>

<p>Willow laughed politely along with everyone else, mentally running through
her spells to see if there was one she could use to help him. Feeling a
gentle prod in her side, she turned to see Buffy's warning face. Sighing,
she let the idea go and gave her partner a reassuring smile. Sometimes,
there were disadvantages to having someone know you as well as she did.</p>

<p>"And we'll be asking for first, last, security and a small cleaning
 deposit," the manager was saying when Willow tuned in again. "The total's
at the bottom of the sheet there."</p>

<p>Anya walked back over to Xander and glanced over the sheet of paper. "He'll
take it. Xander, go get the furniture, I'll wait here." She looked at the
manager. "He's been living in his parents' basement where something urinated
on the hot plate."</p>

<p>Xander pulled Anya aside leaving Buffy and Willow to smile nervously at the
dark-haired woman.</p>

<p>"It's a nice apartment," Buffy offered.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Really nice," Willow backed her up, wincing as she heard Anya whine.</p>

<p>"So, do you have any other places like this?" the Slayer asked.</p>

<p>Willow elbowed her in the ribs.</p>

<p>"What?" the blonde asked. "There's no harm in asking. It's not like I want
to pack and unpack again...although if there was some place I wouldn't...but
at the same time it is closer to classes."</p>

<p>Willow smiled at her. "Buff, the dorm isn't so bad. I wish we could have our
own place too, but we can make the dorm ours."</p>

<p>The blonde nodded and Willow squeezed her hand gently. "I already have the
most important thing in my life there."</p>

<p>"What is...oh. Thanks."</p>

<p>Blushing, Willow remembered the manager and turned to find her looking at
them with undisguised fascination.</p>

<p>"I-I-I-" she managed to stutter.</p>

<p>"She loves her computer," Buffy said, a slight flush staining her cheeks as
well.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Xander chose that moment to interrupt their descent into fiery,
blushing hell. "I guess I'll just start on that application. I think you'll
like it. I've been told I have lovely penmanship."</p>

<p>He rushed out, and the two girls realized that Anya was already gone.</p>

<p>"He's uh..." Willow started.</p>

<p>"Yeah. And we'll just be..." Buffy continued, smiling hopefully at the
manager.</p>

<p>Sighing, they made their escape into the hallway.</p>

<p>"Think they'll be ok?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"They'll sort it out," Buffy reassured her, putting an arm around her
shoulders. "Thanks for what you said back there."</p>

<p>"It's the truth." Willow grinned mischievously. "My computer is really
great."</p>

<p>She wriggled out of Buffy's hold, giggling as the vengeful Slayer chased
after her.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"So, a mythic triumph over a completely indifferent foe?" Buffy summed up,
grinning openly at Giles' flustered expression.</p>

<p>The Gang was assembled in the Magic Box to discuss the first in what would
probably be a stream of attacks on the new proprietor. Buffy and Willow sat
on the floor next to each other, backs against some drawers, with books
spread across their knees while Giles paced in front of them. Surprisingly,
or maybe not so surprisingly, Anya was nowhere to be seen and Xander stood
next to some shelves trying to look as though he was not worried.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not dead or unconscious so I say bravo for me," Giles said
defensively, while Buffy tried not to giggle.</p>

<p>"Some good demons in this one," Willow said, holding up a book. "See if your
guy's in there."</p>

<p>While Giles flicked through the books Xander took the chance to rub in what
they were all thinking. "So you bought the magic shop and you were attacked
before it opened. Who's up for a swingin' chorus of the 'we told you so'
symphony."</p>

<p>Buffy raised her hand and Willow slapped it down, giving her the look she
recognized as 'don't you dare'.</p>

<p>"Toth," Giles said absently.</p>

<p>"Huh?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"He called you a Toth. It's a British expression. It means, like, moron,"
Buffy told him, grinning. She could feel Willow giggling silently next to
her, either because she was right or she was so wrong it was funny.</p>

<p>Giles' words confirmed that option two was the correct one. "No, Toth is the
name of the demon. Ancient demon. Very strong. Last survivor of the Tothric
clan. It also says that for a demon he's unusually sophisticated."</p>

<p>"Sophisticated. So I should discuss men's fashions with him before I chop
his head off?"</p>

<p>"They're referring to the fact that he does not fight bare-handed. He uses
tools, devices. Oh, he's also supposed to be very focused. And since he
mentioned killing the Slayer, I think we know what the focus is."</p>

<p>"Don't they ever have other plans?" Willow asked plaintively. "Like,
starting a quilting circle?"</p>

<p>"Maybe they want to sew my death scene into their newest quilt," Buffy
suggested, smiling at Willow reassuringly. "Where can we find him?"</p>

<p>"There's no mention of the types of places we might find him," Giles said,
scanning through the book again. "But I have an idea. He had a very
distinctive olfactory presence."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess we're off to the olfactory. I hate that place," Xander said,
inducing eye-rolling from everyone. "I'm joking, I know what it means. He
smelled. Right?"</p>

<p>"Some demon rituals involve anointing with oils. Was it sort
of...sandalwoody?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"Um, not even remotely," Giles told her. "But it was very distinctive."</p>

<p>"I'm gonna hate this, aren't I?" Buffy asked, hiding her head on Willow
shoulder.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"I knew I was going to hate this," Buffy complained. "The city dump. Where
smells go to relax and be themselves."</p>

<p>She carefully picked her around the mounds of rubbish, wrinkling her nose at
the powerful smell. Even breathing through her mouth did not help - the
smells just took up residence in her mouth as tastes, which was probably
even more disgusting.</p>

<p>"I found a spell so that you can't smell anything, but it does it by taking
your nose off...so..." Willow trailed off and exchanged glances with Buffy.</p>

<p>"It's no big," she reassured the witch. "Mental note - when Giles makes
comments about smells bring a gas mask."</p>

<p>The Watcher began to glare at Buffy, but turned when they all heard a
rustling noise. The clicks of crossbows loading and stakes being pulled out
echoed through the otherwise silent, stinking dump.</p>

<p>Buffy spotted the source of the noise. Spike was poking through one of the
rubbish mounds and as she watched he pulled out the disconnected arm from a
mannequin.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" she asked, trying to inject as much disgust into
the question as she could muster. Which was a lot thanks to their
surroundings.</p>

<p>"Oh, there's a nice lady vampire who sets up a charming tea room over the
next pile of crap," the vampire said sarcastically. "What do you think I'm
doing? I'm scavenging, aren't I?"</p>

<p>"Spike, uh, we're looking for a demon," Giles said. "Tall, robed, skin sort
of hanging off. Deep voice?"</p>

<p>"You mean a great, tall, robe-y thing like that one?"</p>

<p>Buffy looked behind her found herself facing the tall robed figure of Toth.
The demon was pointing a stick-thing at them and Buffy had enough time to
process this before it discharged a bolt of energy. She threw herself at
Willow and felt the hair on the back of her neck tingle as the energy zapped
overhead.</p>

<p>"Big guy!" Spike yelled cheerfully. "Kick her ass!"</p>

<p>Buffy helped Willow up, not even sparing the time to glare at the vampire,
and tried to work out some way to disarm the demon. Toth did not give them
time to regroup, instead focusing on the Slayer and firing again. She found
herself tackled to the ground before assailant was flying backwards through
the air.</p>

<p>"Xander!" Willow shouted.</p>

<p>Again, Buffy picked herself up from the floor and rushed over to the group
surrounded the downed teen. He was gasping for breath but otherwise seemed
unhurt.</p>

<p>"I'm ok," he panted. "Remind me not to do that again."</p>

<p>"Deal," Buffy said with a relieved smile.</p>

<p>She felt a touch on her arm and looked up to find Willow's green eyes inches
from hers.</p>

<p>"He's gone," the witch said, and Buffy turned to see that she was right.</p>

<p>"He'll be back."</p>

<p>Giles was already helping Xander to his feet so Buffy took his other arm and
let him lean against her. Willow took Buffy's unoccupied hand and the group
slowly walked out of the dump.</p>

<p>"Take it slowly," Giles cautioned.</p>

<p>"Actually I was planning to run the hundred meters," Xander said shakily.</p>

<p>"You could hobble it," Willow offered.</p>

<p>"Need a hand getting home?" Buffy asked.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"Pass me the mace," Buffy said absently, trying fit an extra crossbow in her
bag.</p>

<p>Willow looked uncertainly at the pile of weapons on Buffy's bed and the
large duffel she was trying to put them all into. Morning had brought a
change in the Slayer's attitude to the Toth demon and she was not sure that
it was a good one. Xander seemed unhurt but Buffy was now determined to
bring it down before it could do any more harm - despite Giles' warning that
she not try to tackle the thing without back-up. Willow could appreciate
that a large arsenal of weaponry would probably help, but not when only one
person was operating that arsenal. After all, Buffy could not operate seven
different weapons all at once no matter how much she had trained recently.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you need all that?" she asked, trying to spot the mace in the
middle of the heap.</p>

<p>"Toth is dangerous. I have to defeat him. Ergo, weapons," Buffy stated
carefully.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but..."</p>

<p>"No buts. Xander got hurt because he was out there with me and this needs to
be done. I'm not risking anyone else."</p>

<p>"But Buff, I don't mind being risked. Not that I like danger, but I don't
like staying here while you're getting yourself killed." Willow sniffed,
trying her pitiful look. "I don't want to be the little woman who sits here
and worries while the big strong Slayer goes out and kills the bad guys. We'
re partners, right? That means I get to be the person who goes along and
watches when you kill the bad guys. I can offer support, cast spells and
bring snacks when the big strong Slayer gets hungry."</p>

<p>Buffy put down her bag and took Willow's hand. "I'm sorry. I'm doing it
again, aren't I?"</p>

<p>"Doing what?"</p>

<p>"Over-protecting you."</p>

<p>"A little. It's nice to feel protected, but wrapped-in-cotton-wool is a
little different."</p>

<p>"Sorry."</p>

<p>Willow closed her eyes as Buffy leaned in to steal a kiss.</p>

<p>"Am I forgiven?"</p>

<p>The witch pretended to consider it. "Well, you might have to..."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Kiss me again?"</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy raised an eyebrow at her Watcher.</p>

<p>"Er, well, I suppose...uh...that..."</p>

<p>"I knew you didn't know!" she crowed triumphantly.</p>

<p>Giving into Willow had not been easy, particularly in something she knew she
had to do, but during the confrontation she had realized something. Her
relationship with the shy witch was more important than anything in her
life, including the Slaying, and risking that just was not worth it. So
instead of rushing out and tracking down the Toth demon single-handed she
was at Giles' shop doing research while Willow bought mochas at the Espresso
Pump. She had narrowly managed to choke down her objections to that plan
("It's not safe for you wander around Sunnydale on your own!") and was now
doing her best not to worry. Teasing Giles was a good distraction at least.</p>

<p>A thundering knock on the door startled them both and the Slayer rushed to
open it, a stern lecture about walking in the rain on the tip of her tongue.
Instead she faced Xander looking unusually smart. < Who died? Oh, yeah,
meeting with the realtor. ></p>

<p>"You have to help me," he announced as she opened the door.</p>

<p>"Come in Xander. It's nice to see you too," Buffy said, stepping back from
the door.</p>

<p>"Sorry, hi Buffy." Xander stepped through. "You have to help me. Something
out there is wandering around looking like me."</p>

<p>"Looking like you?" Giles asked. "Something is...imitating you?"</p>

<p>"No, something looks exactly like me. It stole my face. We have to find it
and we have to kill it."</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Xander." Buffy put a reassuring hand on his arm. A glint of
light from something in his hand caught her arm but she shook it off.
"Whatever stole your face, it has to deal with a Slayer now."</p>

<p>Willow pulled her coat around her a peered out of the coffee shop window.
The weather was deteriorating rapidly and running through the streets of
Sunnydale would be a little tough with cups of coffee. So she was sitting in
the shop waiting for a break in the rain to go over to Giles'. Someone
tapped her on the shoulder from behind and she squeaked and whirled around.</p>

<p>"Don't be scared Will. Just listen. It's me, Xander."</p>

<p>It was indeed a very wet, scruffy looking Xander. But she had been friends
with the boy for years so why he felt the need to suddenly tell her that
was, frankly, puzzling.</p>

<p>"And I can prove it."</p>

<p>Curiouser and curiouser.</p>

<p>"Let's see, stuff only you and I know." Xander began to pace in front of
her. "Okay! On my seventh birthday...I wanted a toy fire truck, and I didn't
get it, and you were real nice about it, and then the house next door burnt
down and then the real fire trucks came and for years I thought you set the
fire for me. And if you did you can tell me. For a while last year I thought
I was lactose-intolerant, but it was just some bad Brie. Oh! You bought
Buffy a friendship ring last Christmas but chicken out of giving it to her
and gave her a CD instead."</p>

<p>"Xander, I believe you. Why wouldn't I think you're Xander?"</p>

<p>"Oh, huh," Xander said intelligently, somewhat bewildered now that he did
not need to prove his identity.</p>

<p>"What's going on?"</p>

<p>"Okay, I woke up in the dump this morning."</p>

<p>"Xander, the basement isn't a dump. It-it's more like a really nice hovel."</p>

<p>"No. *The* dump. The city dump. I got hit last night, fell down boom and
woke up this morning."</p>

<p>"Nuh-uh!" Willow shook her head. "We walked you home last night, remember?"</p>

<p>"You walked? Will, did I do anything weird? Did I wave any shiny things
around?"</p>

<p>"Shiny things...what are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Last night, that wasn't me. There's a double out there. Some...thing has
stolen my face and it's going around pretending to be me, and it's
hypnotizing people. It even got to Buffy and Giles. It's over there right
now and they have no idea."</p>

<p>"It's got Buffy? What are we waiting here for?"</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Willow rushed to the magic shop while Xander went in search of Anya.
Surprisingly, he seemed to really care about the former demon.</p>

<p>"Our lived are weird," she muttered to herself as she pushed the door open.</p>

<p>"I swear, this time I *know* I had that locked," Giles muttered.</p>

<p>Willow immediately went to Buffy, not caring that the British man was
watching them, and wrapped her arms around the Slayer's waist.</p>

<p>"Buffy, Toth looks like Xander," she said, calming a little as she felt the
warm presence of her partner surround her.</p>

<p>"We already know. Uh, wait a second, how did you know?"</p>

<p>"He came to me. I-I mean, Xander did." Willow closed her eyes. "He looked
terrible. We need to help him."</p>

<p>"He came to us too," Buffy said, rubbing her hand along Willow's back.</p>

<p>"No, we each had a Xander. I mean...you didn't have a Xander, you had a-a
demon in a Xander suit."</p>

<p>"What makes you sure that yours is the right one?"</p>

<p>The witch pulled back a little. "He knew stuff. Buffy, it was Xander and he
needs our help."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear lord," Giles said from the counter where he was flicking through a
book.</p>

<p>"Our Xander seemed a little...forceful," Buffy mused, resuming her soothing
motions on Willow's back.</p>

<p>"That's not Xander," Willow said, resisting the urge to purr as the tension
melted out of her.</p>

<p>"I said 'dear lord'," Giles said testily.</p>

<p>"You always say that," protested Buffy.</p>

<p>"Well, it's always important."</p>

<p>"Um...is one of them a robot?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"What? No. Uh, the rod-device, it's called a ferula-gemina. It splits one
person in half, distilling personality traits into two separate bodies. As
near as I can tell, Toth was attempting to split the Slayer into two
different entities."</p>

<p>He held out the book and Willow reluctantly disengaged from Buffy to take
it.</p>

<p>"Two Buffys?" the Slayer asked.</p>

<p>Giles nodded. "Yes. One with all the qualities inherent in Buffy Summers,
and the other with everything that belongs to the Slayer alone...the uh,
the-the strength, the, uh, speed, the heritage. And when it hit Xander, I
think it separated him into his strongest points and his weakest."</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head. "So...they're both Xander?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Neither one of them is evil. There's nothing in them that our Xander
doesn't already possess. The two halves can't exist without each other so
kill one part..."</p>

<p>"And we kill Xander," Willow concluded. "Applied to Buffy that would be a
neat plan."</p>

<p>"So what do we do?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Stop them killing each other and then put them back together."</p>

<p>"Killing each other?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, Xander is...oh!"</p>

<p>They exchanged glances and rushed for the door, Giles following close on
their heels.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>The hardest part turned out to be persuading Anya to let them put the
Xanders back. Buffy talked the two men into not killing each other, just in
time for Toth to attempt to kill her again. One sword through a demon later
and Xander had a dead demon and a cleaning bill. No one was hurt, although
the mental pictures Anya conjured were enough to give them all nightmares,
and the rain even stopped.</p>

<p>Buffy walked through the wet streets with Willow's hand clasped firmly in
hers. It was peaceful and right, walking like that, and she smiled inwardly.</p>

<p>"Watcha thinkin' about?" Willow asked sleepily.</p>

<p>Possibly the smile made it to her face, Buffy privately acknowledged.
"Stuff. How good this feels."</p>

<p>"Good. World-shattering thought isn't allowed tonight."</p>

<p>Silence for a while and then Buffy spoke again. "Does it feel weird to know
Xander has his own swanky place?"</p>

<p>"Completely."</p>

<p>"Glad I'm not the only one."</p>

<p>"Nope. Who would have thought it?"</p>

<p>"Yeah." Buffy thought for a while. "The dorm's all right, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It's home."</p>

<p>"Yeah, it is." The Slayer held the door open for her partner. "Anything else
isn't important."</p>

<p>They made their way through the halls to their room in silence and Buffy
unlocked their door. "After you."</p>

<p>"Why thank you, kind lady," Willow said, grinning.</p>

<p>Buffy bowed elaborately and followed her in, planting a kiss on the witch's
lips as the door closed.</p>

<p>For a moment the corridor was silent and still. Then a shadowy figure
stepped around the corner. Her sea-green eyes were shadowed but she bravely
smiled at the happy couple's closed door as she unlocked the door to the
dorm next door and slipped inside.</p>
