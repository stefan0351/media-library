<p>"You know?" Buffy asked, surprise making her voice squeak slightly. "How do
you know?"</p>

<p>Joyce nodded solemnly. "I had a pretty good idea about it yesterday, and you
just confirmed it."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>"It wasn't that hard really. You let a few things slip when we were
talking - you never have been able to hide things when you're upset - and I
put the pieces together. I know you love her, but are you sure you know what
you're doing? You're moving pretty quickly."</p>

<p>"I'm moving...mom, nothing happened last night," Buffy told her. "We're
taking things slowly."</p>

<p>"Nothing happened?"</p>

<p>"Nope. We watched videos, ate pizza and then we fell asleep on the sofa.
Nothing else."</p>

<p>Joyce looked relieved. "Good."</p>

<p>"Mom, are you ok with this? I mean, it must be a bit of a shock."</p>

<p>"Well, yes it is a shock but there's nothing I can do about it. I won't
pretend that I'm comfortable with this but you're my daughter and I've
already learnt that you'll do what you feel is right no matter how I feel.
And I don't want to risk losing you again."</p>

<p>Buffy sat down opposite Joyce and took one of her hands. "You'll never lose
me again. I've changed a lot since then."</p>

<p>"This doesn't mean that I'm going to approve of you staying over with her or
that I'll stop worrying about you."</p>

<p>"I know. But we're taking everything slowly; I don't want to risk messing
things up."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>"And is she?" Joyce looked down at her hands, slightly embarrassed. "I know
you'd never force Willow into something she wasn't comfortable with, but
she's never...you never mentioned...she's..."</p>

<p>Buffy grinned. "Mom, you know Tara?"</p>

<p>"Uh, yes honey. I think you...oh!" The light of understanding dawned in
Joyce's face, tinged with shock and a little bit more embarrassment.
"Oh...Buffy...I had no idea. When you said she was involved I
thought...Oz...he's been, uh, gone for a while now, hasn't he? Is that
why...?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. He came back a few months ago but when it came down to it, Willow
chose Tara. She loved Oz once but I think she's moved past him now."</p>

<p>"So what happened to Tara?"</p>

<p>A gentle smile crossed Buffy's face. "I went to see her before college broke
up and I think she knew then how Willow felt. She almost told me and if I'd
been more alert I'd have seen...but I didn't. I'm not too good where that
stuff is concerned."</p>

<p>"I've noticed."</p>

<p>"Thanks, mom. Tara let Willow go, which is more generous than I could have
been in her position, and told her to go with her heart and here we are. So
you see, Willow probably has a better idea of what we're doing than I do. I
love her and that's not going to change, no matter what else happens."</p>

<p>"I can see that. I just worry about you. This isn't an easy life you've
chosen for yourselves."</p>

<p>"It wasn't a choice. It just is. We're taking things slowly, seeing what
happens, because this is too important to mess up." Buffy paused. "But...I
do want to stay with her this year. We'll get a flat together or something."</p>

<p>"Oh honey, are you sure? It's a huge step to take and if you're so intent on
not messing things up..."</p>

<p>"I'm sure. We shared together last year and that worked out. This will just
be two people rooming together who happen to be partners as well."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure..."</p>

<p>"I am. I haven't asked her yet, but I this feels right."</p>

<p>Joyce looked deeply into her daughter's eyes and sighed at the familiar
determination she saw there. "Well, if you want to do it you'll have to
start looking fairly soon."</p>

<p>"Thanks mom. You are the best."</p>

<p>"I try."</p>

<p>Willow was pacing in her room. She had been pacing for the past half hour.
In fact, she had been pacing for so long she knew that her room was exactly
twelve paces across, but she could make it thirty if she took itty-bitty
steps. Usually, when she needed to think, she would sit at her computer and
surf the Net or maybe flick through a book but today she felt too restless.
Buffy had been gone for two hours and something inside Willow would not
allow her to simply sit and reflect happily. No, instead she was pacing,
worrying and occasionally grinning as she remembered the passionate kisses
they had shared that morning.</p>

<p>Pace, worry, pace. Turn. Pace, worry, pace. Turn.</p>

<p>&lt; She's fine. So what if she hasn't called me like she said she would and
she could be lying hurt somewhere by the road and no-one will find her and
it's all my fault and...I rambled again, didn't I? Sigh. She's fine. She'll
call. She loves me, she told me she does, so there's nothing for me to worry
about. Uh, she's probably...oooh, she did say her mom sounded weird. Maybe
they're having a mother/daughter talk and she hasn't been able to get to the
phone yet. Yeah, that's what happened. &gt;</p>

<p>Pace, worry, pace. Turn. Pace, worry, glance at telephone, pace. Turn.</p>

<p>Willow absently began to nibble on a nail. &lt; Why am I even worrying? Buffy's
the Slayer - nothing can get her. She's fine. Oh, oh, what if her mom knows?
About us? She did call me, after all, and maybe she...nah, Mrs. Summers is
always in denial about things. She probably just freaked because of the
storm and now Buffy's trying to calm her down. Yup, that's what happened. So
why am I still worrying? &gt;</p>

<p>Pace, worry, pace. Turn. Pace, worry, stop biting your nails, pace. Turn.</p>

<p>Ring!</p>

<p>Willow dived across her bed to grab the phone, fumbled and dropped it on the
floor where it rolled under the bed. She growled, a surprising sound for the
normally calm redhead, and leaned down to try to find it. The telephone rang
again and she wriggled a little further over the edge of the bed. She
stretched as far as she could but it was tantalisingly out of reach.</p>

<p>It rang again and Willow muttered, frustrated, "I'm coming, I'm...ugh,
monster fluff bunny...I'm trying to...would you hold on a
moment?...uph!...ok, I'm nearly...ow!"</p>

<p>She slithered down and landed on the floor with a painful bump. But at least
she had the telephone.</p>

<p>"H-hello?" she panted.</p>

<p>"Hi Will," Buffy's voice echoed chirpily down the line. "How's my favourite
witch?"</p>

<p>"Sore," Willow muttered, rubbing the shoulder she had twisted as she fell.
"But feeling better now I can hear your voice."</p>

<p>"Sore? What's wrong? Are you hurt?" The concern in the Slayer's voice rang
through the line, putting a smile onto Willow's face.</p>

<p>"I'm fine. I just, sort of, maybe, fell off the bed...a little bit."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I was trying to get the telephone. It escaped and..."</p>

<p>"You chased it?"</p>

<p>"Yup, lots of chasing."</p>

<p>"You chased it off the bed."</p>

<p>"Maybe."</p>

<p>"And landed on what?"</p>

<p>Willow winced as she tried to move her arm. "My shoulder."</p>

<p>"Ok, I'm coming right over."</p>

<p>"No, you don't have to-"</p>

<p>"I'm. Coming. Over," Buffy said firmly and the telephone went dead in
Willow's ear.</p>

<p>She slowly hit disconnect and sat on the floor for a while thinking. The she
cocked her head. "What am I worrying about now? Buffy's gonna be here in a
few minutes...I'm gonna see my girlfriend."</p>

<p>Stiffly, Willow stood up and put the telephone safely on her desk. The she
slowly walked downstairs. She was pottering around in the kitchen, getting a
glass of water, when the doorbell rang. Skipping happily, she ran to the
door and pulled it open. Buffy stood on the other side with bag.</p>

<p>"Hi," Willow said, suddenly shy.</p>

<p>"Hi," Buffy said cheerfully. "I brought ice...and bandages...and aspirin."</p>

<p>"You came prepared."</p>

<p>"And mom's sitting in the car, waiting for me," Buffy said less cheerfully.
"She knows about us and I think she might be freaking."</p>

<p>Willow peeked around her shoulder to see Mrs. Summers sitting in her car,
nervously tapping the dashboard and trying not to look at them. "I think you
might be right. I'm fine, really. It's just a bruise."</p>

<p>Buffy frowned. "Will, I worry. It's my privilege as your girlfriend to worry
about injuries, however minor, and look after them. It gives me an excuse to
spoil you."</p>

<p>The redheaded witch could feel a goofy grin spreading across her face.</p>

<p>"What?" Buffy asked. "Did I say something silly?"</p>

<p>"Girlfriend. You said you're my girlfriend."</p>

<p>An equally goofy grin spread across Buffy's face. "Yeah, I did, didn't I? Is
that ok? I mean, is it ok to call you that? Or is it too much, or too soon
or-"</p>

<p>Willow put a finger over her lips to cut her off. "It's fine. It made me
feel all...goose bumpy, but it a good way."</p>

<p>Buffy glanced back at the car where Mrs. Summers was waiting tensely. "Look,
do you want to come back to my house? I think mom will feel better if I look
after you there, where she is, rather than in this big, empty house all on
our own. She's a little freaked."</p>

<p>The redheaded hacker smiled gently. "Yeah, let's go. My shoulder's getting
achy."</p>

<p>They joined hands and walked down the path to the car.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy gently examined the bruise that was beginning to turn purple on
Willow's shoulder. The young witch had had undone the top buttons of her
shirt so it just exposed the damaged skin, to satisfy Joyce's requirements
of 'nothing going on', and her shoulder was already stiffening badly. Buffy
winced as Willow flinched away from her careful examination.</p>

<p>"You ok?" she asked.</p>

<p>Willow smiled weakly. "I've been better. But, I've also been worse so...and
it's not as bad as it looks. I just have to remember not to fall off the bed
in future."</p>

<p>Buffy concentrated on buttoning up Willow's shirt, and ignoring the creamy
flesh she was covering up, as she said, "I could help you."</p>

<p>"Help me? Uh, how?"</p>

<p>The Slayer began making a sling so she did not have to look in Willow's
eyes. "Well, I was thinking...we did ok last year, sharing. And now that
we're not doing the distance thing we'd probably get on even better. It's
not like it would be something new. We'd just be carrying on last year's
arrangement. We don't have to do anything we're not comfortable with yet
and...Will, would you like to, maybe, share next year?"</p>

<p>"Buffy, are you asking me to move in?"</p>

<p>"Only if you want to. We could get separate stuff and just be like we were
last year. Only, maybe smooching sometimes."</p>

<p>Buffy risked a glance up to see Willow's expression was surprised to see a
look of delighted understanding there.</p>

<p>"I'd hope we could smooch more than sometimes," Willow said, grinning.
"Maybe we could have a 'good morning' kiss thing, and a 'good night' kiss,
and maybe a 'nice to see you' kiss."</p>

<p>"There's lots of good reasons to kiss," Buffy agreed. "So, do you want to
try?"</p>

<p>Willow leaned over a lightly kissed her Slayer. "Yes."</p>

<p>A throat clearing behind them stopped any further discussion along those
lines.</p>

<p>"Hi, mom," Buffy said, turning to her mother with a bright grin. "I was just
checking Willow's sling-"</p>

<p>"I could see what you were doing," Joyce said, flushing slightly. "I was
going to see if Willow might like to stay here tonight. Mom's intuition
tells me that otherwise I'm going to end up seeing you beg."</p>

<p>Buffy knew she was grinning and she was relieved to see a grin on Willow's
face when she peeked over.</p>

<p>"Thanks, mom, you're the best," she said happily.</p>

<p>"Remember girls, I'm a mom so I have ears like a hawk. Willow, you can sleep
in the guest room and if I hear any sneaking about..."</p>

<p>She left the threat vague enough that both girls knew it would not be worth
their lives to try anything.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Late that night Buffy lay in bed trying to sleep. Something inside her
itched to be outside, moving and fighting, but she firmly resisted the
impulse. She knew she could not go downstairs and get some water because
Joyce would hear and probably be unpleasant about it. And if she wanted to
be allowed get a place with Willow, not annoying Joyce was top of her
'to-do' list. So instead she was lying in bed, feeling restless and trying
to sleep.</p>

<p>It was impossible. The need to be out hunting was too strong. Sighing
inside, Buffy threw back the covers and silently prepared herself.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>A couple of hours later, worn-out and dirty, Buffy crept in through the
window. She silently dropped to the floor and deposited her weapons bag
beside her dresser. In a few minutes she had changed and was deeply asleep
in her bed.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The midday sun bathed the beach with cheerful sunlight and warmed the
gathered teens. Willow and Anya lay on towels, dividing their attention
between watching Xander attempt to light a fire and watching Buffy and Giles
fight with quarterstaffs.</p>

<p>Buffy executed a neat series of parries and attempted to sweep Giles' legs
out from under him. It all worked perfectly up until the moment when she did
a little war dance to celebrate her victory. From his prone position, the
former Watcher casually swept her legs away and she landed with a loud
'oof!'</p>

<p>"Buffy, even if your opponent is on the floor don't become distracted,"
Giles instructed as he helped her up. "You take too long on the recovery and
are easily distracted from your objective."</p>

<p>"Don't count your chickens before they're hatched," Buffy commented as she
brushed some of the sand away.</p>

<p>"Uh, exactly. Now, shall we try again?"</p>

<p>"Let's shall."</p>

<p>Xander shook his head as he broke another match. "I'm exhausted just looking
at those two. All that hitting and running and jumping...shouldn't
beach-time mean relaxation? Not exertion?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," Anya confirmed. "Exertion can lead to sweatiness."</p>

<p>"And exhaustion, which leads to injuries," Xander added.</p>

<p>Willow dragged her eyes away from the Slayer's tempting form. "I think we've
just put our fingers on why we're the sidekicks."</p>

<p>She was distracted again as Buffy and Giles approached carrying the
splintered remains of the quarterstaffs.</p>

<p>"Training over?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"We need new sticks," Buffy confirmed. "They just don't make wood like they
used to."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I noticed it was becoming less woody," Willow said with a grin and
patted the towel beside her.</p>

<p>Buffy flopped to the ground and looked over to Xander. "Where's my burger?"</p>

<p>Giles looked at the pile of wood in front of the dark haired teen. "I rather
thought this was meant to be a barbeque."</p>

<p>Xander winced. "The, uh, fire's not cooperating. It's comforting to know I
lack the culinary finesse of a caveman."</p>

<p>Willow gestured at the fire. "Ignis incende."</p>

<p>Xander scrambled back as the pile of logs burst into flames.</p>

<p>"Willow, check you out! Witch-fu," Buffy said grinning. Then she leaned
closer and whispered, "I'll have to be careful not to upset you now."</p>

<p>"Just another incentive to do as I say," the redhead whispered back with an
evil grin. Aloud, she said, "It's no big. You just have to balance the
elements so when you affect one, you don't wind up causing..."</p>

<p>In the distance, the group heard a crash of thunder and the sky began to
darken ominously.</p>

<p>"I didn't do it! I didn't do it!" Willow protested as they rushed around
gathering up their belongings.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy pushed back from the table slightly and smiled at her mother. "Thanks
mom. Everything was yummy."</p>

<p>Joyce looked at her, a little sadly. "Hey, you up for dessert? We could, uh,
get some ice cream."</p>

<p>Buffy stood and began to clear away her dishes. "You know, I would but I
kind of have to get out on patrol."</p>

<p>"Now? It's 8.30."</p>

<p>"Well, vamps don't really care what time it is. You know, dark equals dinner
bell."</p>

<p>"If you want to go and see Willow, you don't need to lie to me, you know.
I'll understand."</p>

<p>Buffy kissed Joyce on the cheek before carrying her plates into the kitchen.
"It's not that. I might see her after patrol but I do need to get out there.
I've been a little tardy in my duty lately and I need to get back into the
swing of it."</p>

<p>"All right." Joyce looked around the empty table. "You know, I'm gonna have
to get used to this place without you again. It gets so quiet."</p>

<p>Re-entering the dining room, Buffy hugged her mother gently. "We'll have to
make a regular date of this when school starts."</p>

<p>"Mm," Joyce said vaguely.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, duty calls." She kissed her mother on the cheek again. "It's a
total drag."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy rejoiced in the feeling of power and strength as adrenaline rushed
through her veins. The fight, not her first that night, empowered her and
the taste of victory was sweet as she finally staked the vampire.</p>

<p>She stood up, grinning with satisfaction, and began stalking through the
cemetery towards the next grave. Something inside her tingled and itched.
Something wrong...</p>

<p>For a moment she stood still, trying to find the source of the wrongness,
and then she whirled around to find someone standing behind her. He was
tall, with long dark hair and his face looked like he had an accident with a
tub of talcum powder.</p>

<p>"Very impressive hunt," he said, his accent sounding like Dracula from one
of the inferior Hammer movies. "Such power."</p>

<p>Annoyed, Buffy frowned at him. "That was no hunt. That was just another day
on the job."</p>

<p>The tall man stepped closer.</p>

<p>"Care to step up for some overtime?" Buffy asked, brandishing a stake.</p>

<p>"We're not going to fight."</p>

<p>"Do you *know* what a Slayer is?"</p>

<p>The strange man smirked. "Do you?"</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I apologize. I assumed you knew. I'm Dracula."</p>

<p>For a moment Buffy was surprised, then her sense of humour kicked in. "Get
out!"</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Xand, I think I need to tell you something," Willow began nervously.</p>

<p>They were walking to the cemetery from the Espresso Pump to meet Buffy after
her patrol and Willow was trying not to spill the two mochas she carried on
a cardboard tray, despite being only having the use of one hand and that
hand shaking so badly the plastic cups rattled together.</p>

<p>"Will, I know," Xander assured her.</p>

<p>"You know?"</p>

<p>Xander smiled at her. "The two of you are the worst secret keepers I've ever
known. All that whispering, and the looks, and holding hands - yup, I saw
that in the coffee shop - it doesn't really fool old Xander."</p>

<p>"A-And?"</p>

<p>"I told you before, it's cool with me." Xander grinned. "And I don't just
mean that in a 'you and Buffy doing things I'd really like to know about'
way. You're happy, she's happy, therefore I'm happy."</p>

<p>"Sometimes I think you must be the best actor ever," Willow said, feeling
her heart rate return to normal. "You act pretty dumb sometimes and then you
come out with things like that."</p>

<p>"I do? Oh, I mean, I do." Xander tried to act as though he knew what she was
talking about. "Wanna go see your girlfriend?"</p>

<p>"Ok. No arguments from me."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"So, let me get this straight," Buffy said, trying not to laugh. "You're
"Dracula". The guy, the count."</p>

<p>Dracula smiled, showing off his fangs. "I am."</p>

<p>"Are you're sure this isn't some fan boy thing? Cause...I've fought more
than a couple of pimply overweight vamps that called themselves Lestat."</p>

<p>"You know who I am. As I know without question that you are Buffy Summers."</p>

<p>"You've heard of me?"</p>

<p>"Naturally. You're known throughout the world."</p>

<p>She tried to resist, but the flattery was too much. "Naw, really?"</p>

<p>"Why else would I come here? For the sun? I came to meet the
renowned...killer."</p>

<p>A hot flame of anger kindled inside Buffy. "I prefer the term Slayer. You
know, killer sounds so..."</p>

<p>"Naked?"</p>

<p>"Like I...paint clowns or something. I'm the good guy, remember?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but your power is rooted in darkness. You must feel it."</p>

<p>Buffy frowned and tried to ignore the tiny voice inside that insisted he was
right. Instead, she opted for bravado. "No. You know what I feel? Bored."</p>

<p>She lunged at him with her stake, trying to get the element of surprise.
Instead of feeling the satisfying thud as her stake penetrated his heart,
Dracula dissolved into smoke and Buffy found herself off balance. As she
straightened, the old vampire reappeared behind her. Concentrating hard, she
lunged at him and again he dissolved into smoke.</p>

<p>"Okay, that's cheating," Buffy announced peevishly.</p>

<p>Xander and Willow approached through the graves and looked at her curiously.</p>

<p>"Hey, Buff. What's up?" Xander greeted.</p>

<p>Willow, more sensitive to her love's moods than her friend, looked
concerned. "You look like you just-"</p>

<p>"Get out of here now," Buffy order, scanning the area.</p>

<p>"But I brought you mocha," Willow protested.</p>

<p>Dracula reappeared behind the two friends and Buffy sighed unhappily.
"Behind you."</p>

<p>Willow and Xander turned and did a double take as they saw the oddly dressed
vampire.</p>

<p>"Hi," the redhead greeted cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Nice," Xander complimented sarcastically. "Look who's got a bad case of
dark prince envy."</p>

<p>Dracula looked the boy up and down and then dismissed him. "I have no
interest in you. Leave us."</p>

<p>"No, we're not going to 'leave you'," Xander said, trying a disastrous
impression of the Count. "And where'd you get that accent, Sesame Street?
Vun, two, three - three victims! Mwa ha ha!"</p>

<p>Dracula began to look annoyed and Buffy winced. "Xander, I'm pretty sure
that's Dracula."</p>

<p>"Wow, really?" Deciding that cowardice was the better part of
self-preservation Xander ducked behind the Slayer. "Hey, sorry man. I was
just...joking around?"</p>

<p>"This is not the same," the vampire announced, locking eyes with Buffy. "I
will see you soon."</p>

<p>He spread his cape out impressively, took a couple of steps towards the
group and turned into a bat. The bat flew away, squeaking, and the three
teenagers looked at each other. Unsurprisingly, the bat returned and
dive-bombed Buffy's hair before making its final exit.</p>

<p>"Bat! Ooh, bat!" Buffy exclaimed, flapping her hands around her head to get
rid of the flying pest.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The night was drawing close to the 'witching hour', an ironic name in
Sunnydale, and most of the living residents of the small town had long since
given in to sleep and gone to bed. Buffy knew that the only reason her
mother was still awake and drinking coffee in the kitchen was because she
and Willow had not yet retreated.</p>

<p>The Slayer and the witch were sitting in the lounge enjoying some alone time
together. Buffy lay along the sofa with her head in Willow's lap and the
redhead was slowly stroking her blonde hair, which was proving to be a
thoroughly enjoyable sensation. They were both close to sleep but reluctant
to go to bed because that would mean parting.</p>

<p>"Will," Buffy said sleepily.</p>

<p>"That's my name."</p>

<p>"How did Xander take it?"</p>

<p>"Hmm?"</p>

<p>"When you told him about us," the blonde girl clarified. "How did he take
it?"</p>

<p>"How did you know I told him?"</p>

<p>Buffy smiled slyly, although she kept her eyes shut and relaxed into the
soothing sensations as Willow gently stroked her forehead and down through
her golden hair. "I know you. That trip to the coffee shop - not that I'm
complaining about mochas - wasn't really essential. You told him about us,
huh?"</p>

<p>"Well, yeah," Willow said, enjoying the feel of silky hair between her
fingers. "He took it really well. So long as we're happy, he's happy."</p>

<p>The redheaded witch knew there was something else on Buffy's mind, but she
also knew that the Slayer would have to work her way up to it. They had been
friends for long enough that she often felt as though she could read Buffy's
thoughts.</p>

<p>"Will," Buffy began again, and this time the redhead could hear the
uncertainty in her voice.</p>

<p>"Yeah, Buff," she said reassuringly. "What's up?"</p>

<p>Buffy opened her eyes and Willow read all the confusion and fear in those
beautiful blue orbs. "Did you mean it earlier? When you said Dracula
was...sexy?"</p>

<p>Rolling her eyes, Willow grinned down at her unhappy love. "Of course I did,
in a magnetising, faintly icky, vampirish way. But not in a beautiful,
blonde Slayer that I'm in love with way. Those are two completely different
concepts."</p>

<p>"Oh. Are you sure?"</p>

<p>Willow bent her head and, very gently, kissed Buffy's mouth.</p>

<p>"I'm sure," she assured her.</p>

<p>Buffy sat up and faced her. "I don't want you to feel like I'm forcing-"</p>

<p>"You aren't forcing me," Willow protested. "I want this as much as you do.
So there's no forcing going on."</p>

<p>The Slayer cocked her head to the side and carefully observed Willow, and in
return the redhead put her best 'I'm in love with you' look on. Evidently
satisfied, Buffy leaned forward to kiss the witch.</p>

<p>The sound of a throat clearing in the doorway behind them made both girls
leap apart, startled.</p>

<p>"Isn't it time for you girls to be going to sleep?" Joyce asked, glaring
significantly.</p>

<p>"Right, mom, just going," Buffy said quickly.</p>

<p>"Yeah, good night Mrs Summers," Willow squeaked.</p>

<p>They both dashed for the stairs, giggling.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy woke with a gasp to find the strange vampire standing at the foot of
her bed, his whitened face gleaming eerily in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"You are magnificent," Dracula said admiringly.</p>

<p>Mustering her courage, Buffy retorted, "I bet you say that before you bite
all the girls."</p>

<p>"No, you are different. Kindred."</p>

<p>"Kindred?" Buffy scoffed. "Hardly, I-"</p>

<p>"Pull back your hair."</p>

<p>Unconsciously, Buffy complied and was startled when she realised what she
had done.</p>

<p>"This isn't how I...usually fight," she protested, looking out of the window
to try to shake the strange compulsion. "You think you can waft in here with
your music video wind and your hypno-eyes..."</p>

<p>"I have searched the world over for you. I have yearned for you." He sat on
the bed next to her. "For a creature whose darkness rivals my own."</p>

<p>The ancient vampire put his fingers on Buffy's chin and gently turned her
face so he could see the scars on her neck from the events of Ascension Day.</p>

<p>He smiled slightly. "You have been tasted."</p>

<p>Buffy tried to protest. "He was-"</p>

<p>"Unworthy. He let you go. But his embrace...his bite...you remember."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Dracula caressed her face and whispered, "Do not fight. I can feel your
hunger."</p>

<p>As he leaned in, Buffy knew she should be struggling but a strange lassitude
overcame her and all she could do was wordlessly gasp her protest. She could
no more have stopped him biting her than she could stop the world revolving.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy woke up with a gasp to find the room empty and sunlight streaming in
through the windows. Rubbing her eyes, she made her way to the bathroom and
splashed water on her face to try to rid herself of the gritty, tired
feeling. She looked into the mirror for a moment and then pulled down the
neck of her shirt to reveal twin sets of puncture marks. Sighing tiredly she
made her way back to her room to dress.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Giles' apartment was full to bursting with munching teenagers. Boxes of
donuts and cups of coffee were strewn over the coffee table and the man
himself occupied one of the armchairs. Xander and Anya had commandeered the
sofa leaving Buffy and Willow to sit on the floor, leaning against it.
Willow looked at her partner curiously, wondering at the strained expression
on her face. She had seemed so cheerful the night before, but this morning
she had barely managed more than 'Good morning'. And the outfit was not one
of her normal ones - when did Buffy go back to wearing scarves?</p>

<p>Giles picked up one of the donut boxes. "Oh, there's another jelly here.
Would you like it Buffy?"</p>

<p>Buffy stirred from her stupor. "No, thanks."</p>

<p>Immediately Xander leapt up and grabbed the sugary morsel. "Got it! Got it!
Mine, mine."</p>

<p>Willow frowned slightly but let it pass. Maybe everyone was just depressed
by the end of the summer. "Well, I think we have Dracula factoids."</p>

<p>"Like any of that's enough to fight the Dark Master," Xander said, sitting
down on a stool. He noticed the odd looks that everyone was now giving him.
"...bator."</p>

<p>Willow continued, "A lot of it we already know. Turnoffs: wood, fire,
crosses, garlic. Turnons: nice duds, minions, long slow bites that last for
days...where was I?"</p>

<p>"Dracula research," Anya prodded. "He likes style, so he isn't going to
haunting the usual areas."</p>

<p>"Ah! But he's smart enough to figure out that we probably already know that.
I'm guessing he's lying low," Xander protested.</p>

<p>"Actually, my research backs up Anya. Drac isn't the lying low type."</p>

<p>"So we can, uh, check out the nice places, don't you think Buffy?" Giles
asked.</p>

<p>Buffy didn't respond, continuing to stare at the table.</p>

<p>"Buffy?" Giles repeated.</p>

<p>Buffy blinked and tuned back in again. "Yeah. We'll check out the swanky
places first. What else did you get?"</p>

<p>Willow surreptitiously squeezed her hand, growing concerned by Buffy's
obvious distraction. "OK, Dracula's modus operandi is different from other
vampires. He will kill just to feed, but he'd rather have a connection to
the victims. And he has all these mental powers to draw them in."</p>

<p>The redhead watched her girlfriend carefully and was unsurprised to see the
thoughtful look crossing her face. "He, he can read and control
minds...appear in dreams..."</p>

<p>"Uh, huh," Buffy said absently.</p>

<p>"Makes sense. That stare...he just kinda...looked right through you. Didn't
you feel it Buffy?"</p>

<p>"No." Buffy paused uncertainly and stood, not even noticing Willow's
frightened expression. "No, I didn't."</p>

<p>"See!" Xander crowed. "Buffy didn't feel it. I think you're drawing a load
of crazy conclusions about the unholy prince...bator."</p>

<p>"The point is," Giles added, "though he goes through the motions of
seduction the end result is always the same. He turns them into a vampire."</p>

<p>"Well, that *is* intimate," Xander said eagerly. "Dracula's gifting these
ladies with his own blood. And blood...blood is life." Realising what he had
said he added, "According to them."</p>

<p>"Um...just be aware that he, he tends to form a relationship with his prey.
It's not enough for him to take her. She must want to be taken. She
must...burn for him," Giles said, watching Buffy closely.</p>

<p>The Slayer almost visibly squirmed, fiddling with her scarf, and Willow was
suddenly hit by a horrid idea that was confirmed by the blonde's next words.</p>

<p>"That's...interesting. I'm gonna go find him."</p>

<p>Taking a deep breath, Willow stood and put a restraining hand on the girl's
arm. "What's wrong Buffy?"</p>

<p>"Wrong? Nothing's wrong," the Slayer replied, not looking into her love's
eyes.</p>

<p>"Now I know something's wrong," Willow said, hurt.</p>

<p>Before Buffy could protest, the redhead reached up and pulled away the scarf
to reveal the twin puncture marks. The room went silent as everyone took in
the sight and then Buffy sat down with her face in her hands.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say anything?" Giles asked.</p>

<p>"Cause she didn't want to worry us, right Buffster?" Xander suggested. "It's
nothin'. Just a scratch."</p>

<p>"Two deep, puncture-y scratches," Willow added. "Why didn't you tell me?
When did this happen?"</p>

<p>Buffy lifted her face and fixed Willow with sorrowful eyes. "I'm sorry. I
don't know why...there was just this voice telling me to cover it."</p>

<p>"You're under his thrall," Giles told her.</p>

<p>"You're saying Dracula has some sort of freaky mind control over her?"
Xander tried to laugh. "You're watching to many creature features, G-man."</p>

<p>"But it does seem like he has this...control over me. I...even though a part
of me is resisting..."</p>

<p>"You should stay out of sight," Giles said, sighing heavily.</p>

<p>"I can't go home - he already got in once," Buffy protested.</p>

<p>"Xander, take her to your place while Willow and I secure her house," Giles
instructed. "Then we'll look for Dracula."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Will," Buffy said, touching the redhead's hand hesitantly.</p>

<p>Knowing there were people watching, Willow could not comfort her the way she
wanted to so she had to content herself with squeezing the Slayer's hand and
replying, "I know."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>It took a while to work the spell to dis-invite Dracula from the Summers'
house, accompanied by Joyce's stricken apologies, and then Giles and Willow
began wandering Sunnydale looking for Dracula's lair. They walked
disconsolately through the gardens of their twelfth mansion of the day as
Willow crossed it off the list.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess at least we're narrowing it down," the redhead said, trying
to cheer herself up.</p>

<p>"I suppose," Giles said slowly, concentrating on not falling over anything
on the darkening path.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing Sunnydale isn't any bigger - this could take all week
otherwise."</p>

<p>"True."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment before Willow asked quietly, "What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"I should have noticed."</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>Giles sighed. "I'm her Watcher - at least I was - so I should have noticed
that something was wrong. She was acting oddly last night and this morning
and I didn't even notice."</p>

<p>They reached the road and continued along it.</p>

<p>"Don't beat yourself up," Willow told him. "If anyone should have noticed
that something was wrong it should be me. We're, uh, good friends and I
should have noticed something was wrong when she didn't even...uh, say hi at
breakfast." &lt; I don't think he needs to know about the non-kisses this
morning. So shut up mouth, please? &gt; The witch sighed. "We were both being
unobservant. And now...uh, Giles?"</p>

<p>"Hmm?"</p>

<p>"I've lived here all my life, but you know something?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I've never noticed that we have a castle before."</p>

<p>Giles followed her gaze and saw a large, intimidating-looking castle. It
would not have looked out of place in Transylvania, which was probably
appropriate.</p>

<p>"Bloody hell," the Watcher breathed.</p>

<p>"I think we've found Dracula," Willow commented.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Inside the castle, the witch and the Watcher spent a moment gazing around
with interest before looking at each other.</p>

<p>"We shouldn't split up," Giles told her, looking significantly at the girl's
sling.</p>

<p>"But...ok," Willow said reluctantly. "Which way?"</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>It took them a while, and they narrowly avoided falling into a pit filled
with vampires, but they eventually found a barred door with Xander standing
in front of it.</p>

<p>"Nobody harms my master," Xander told them seriously.</p>

<p>Giles sighed, and Willow thought she detected a flicker of amusement in his
eyes before he said, "Your master?"</p>

<p>"You want him? You come through me."</p>

<p>Giving him a brief look, Giles hauled back and punched the teenager who
toppled to the floor immediately.</p>

<p>"I'll apologize later," he told Willow.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"You know, I think the thrall has gone out of our relationship," Buffy told
the ancient vampire. "But I want to thank you for opening up my eyes a
little."</p>

<p>"What's this?" Dracula asked, disbelieving.</p>

<p>"My true nature. You want a taste?"</p>

<p>The fight that ensued was different to the majority of Buffy's fights. For a
start, usually her opponent did not disappear part way through and appear in
another part of the room. Also, she felt unusually energised - the punches
and rolls came easier and she allowed herself to feel a fierce joy in
pummelling her ancient foe.</p>

<p>Dracula disappeared again and Buffy froze, extending every sense she had.
With a feral grin she hopped down from the table she had been on and ran up
the stairs with Mister Pointy. When Dracula reappeared he looked shocked to
see the Slayer standing there already, her stake ready for use.</p>

<p>"How do you like my darkness now?" she asked, staking him.</p>

<p>The ancient vampire growled, fell down the steps and exploded into dust.</p>

<p>Buffy was sauntering down the stairs smugly as Willow and Giles rushed in.</p>

<p>"Buffy! Are you ok?" the witch asked immediately.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy said, grinning. "Chock full of free will and happy to see
you."</p>

<p>"And Dracula?" Giles asked.</p>

<p>"Euro trashed."</p>

<p>"Where is he?" Xander asked angrily, rushing into the room holding a torch.
"Where's the creep that turned me into his spider-eating man-bitch?"</p>

<p>"He's gone," Buffy told him.</p>

<p>"Dammit! You know what? I'm sick of this crap. I'm sick of being the guy who
eats insects and gets the funny syphilis. As of this moment, it's over. I'm
finished being everybody's butt-monkey!"</p>

<p>Willow, Giles and Buffy valiantly concentrated on not laughing, although
Willow's lips twitched suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Check, no more butt-monkey," Buffy confirmed.</p>

<p>"Giles said he's sorry for hitting you," Willow said comfortingly.</p>

<p>"I did?" Giles exclaimed, and then re-thought. "Oh, yes, I did. Sorry about
that."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy stared at the door in front of her uncertainly. She had already tried
to knock three times and each time she had chickened. But it was something
she had to do. She had to know...</p>

<p>She knocked on the door and was relieve to hear Giles' voice beckoning her
in.</p>

<p>"Hi Giles," she said, entering. "I wanted to...ooh, cookies. How come I rate
the cookie treatment?"</p>

<p>He gestured for her to sit down and held out the plate, watching as she took
one and began nibbling it nervously.</p>

<p>"I thought you might have something to tell me," he told her encouraging.</p>

<p>"Well, yeah."</p>

<p>"Whatever is going on between yourself and Willow is your own business," he
told her, smiling at her startled expression. "If you're both happy and it
isn't interfering with your Slaying then I'm very pleased for you."</p>

<p>"You-you-you...you know?" Buffy asked, feeling very stupid.</p>

<p>"Buffy, neither of you has ever been able to keep a secret." He smiled at
her. "She's a lovely girl and I've always known you care about her deeply.
So long as you don't hurt her-"</p>

<p>"I don't plan on it."</p>

<p>"Then that is all that really matters."</p>

<p>"Oh."</p>

<p>"Was there anything else?"</p>

<p>Buffy took a deep breath. "I know we've been training together a little, and
it's really helped, but I think...I need more help. I need my Watcher back.
This whole thing with Dracula, it's made me face up to how much I don't know
about myself and about my destiny as a Slayer. Ever since we did that spell
where we called on the First Slayer...I've been going out a lot. Most
nights."</p>

<p>"Patrolling?"</p>

<p>"Hunting. That's what Dracula called it." She stood and began to pace. "And
he was right. He understood my power better than I do. He saw darkness in
it."</p>

<p>Giles looked at her, concerned.</p>

<p>"I need to know more." Buffy said down and looked the older man intently.
"About where I came from, about the other Slayers. I mean, maybe...maybe if
I could learn to control this thing, I could be stronger, I could be better.
If I don't, I could hurt Willow. But...I'm scared. I know it's gonna be
hard. And I can't do it...without you. I need your help. I need you to be my
Watcher again. I promise, this time I'll work at it. Please?"</p>

<p>Giles smiled at her.</p>

<p>"Boy, I just keep talking don't I?" Buffy said, returning his smile.
"Willow's influence I guess."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy peeked into her mother's bedroom. "I'm outta here. Willow and I are
going to movies - our first official date."</p>

<p>"Okay, have a good time," Joyce told her, trying to smile.</p>

<p>Buffy walked into her bedroom to get her bag and was surprised to find a
girl with long brown hair sitting on her bed. "What are you *doing* here?"</p>

<p>"Buffy?" Joyce called. "If you're going out, why don't you take your sister?
And try to behave around her?"</p>

<p>Buffy and the stranger turned to the door, looking annoyed.</p>

<p>"Mom!" they both exclaimed.</p>

<p>Something inside Buffy screamed but the feeling cut off abruptly and she
turned to glare at her sister.</p>
