<!-- My Protector \ Part 2 -->

<p>Giving herself over to total fascination, she stood in the doorway to
her imperial chambers and watched. She was unused to the way she felt when her
slave was near, enlivened and peculiarly weak at the same
time. Breathless. </p>
<p>Major Ramsey was tall and exotic. This afternoon she wore only the black
collar and a white loincloth. The word 'glorious' took soundless form on the
lips of Empress Sarika, who was rapidly coming of age at an unfortunate time.
Responsibilities seemed endless to her after her mother's death. The
Rebellion of renegade Menials threatened to bring chaos to the empire and even
though her obligation to end the conflict required her full attention, the
sovereign's mind was more occupied with her new slave than her duties.</p>
<p>Ramsey's sable-black hair flowed around her firm breasts and wide shoulders
while she exercised, sticking here and there to wet skin. Her strength revealed
itself everywhere the empress looked, from athletic calves and thighs to her
smoothly defined buttocks, and graceful back. The veins at the junction of
Ramsey's biceps and forearms were prominent, adding a slight blue-tinged
perfection. And in her clear blue eyes a contradiction of peril and peace
existed. Sarika felt an affinity more profound than what she experienced with
The Source. It was an unrivaled passion. And once awakened, now she could not
imagine living without.</p>
<p>She remembered the kiss they shared that morning. A pulse had beat wildly
against her lips when she touched the warmth of that splendid neck. Those
moments had seared themselves into her memory, haunting her the rest of the day
and distracting her at inappropriate times. So much so, that the morning
cleansing ritual with her priestesses had been nearly impossible to complete. As
a princess she had meditated and prayed throughout her life, learning the
discipline that was necessary, enhancing her natural ability to complete her
destined role, and now that she was empress….</p>
<p>But it was wonderful. Ramsey must care something for her. Why else would she
cover her body with her own when she thought there was a threatening presence in
the garden. In a shared vision before her death, her mother had called Major
Ramsey &quot;the dark one.&quot; She said Ramsey would be Sarika's counselor and
lead her to The Protector. '<i>No</i>,' Sarika now reasoned, '<i>a Menial
doesn't counsel a Ruler. Ramsey was destined to play a much different role.' </i>A
single thought burned within her. She could make Ramsey love her.</p>
<p>The Major paused and narrowed her eyes. She was unaware that the empress
watched her, but felt a burgeoning consciousness of her own body. Not being
especially vain, it added to her disquiet. She concentrated on her makeshift
punching bag, pleased that the white string, woven into shreds of brown cloth
remained stitched to the leather-covered strong box. Although dented by the
pounding it was receiving, the box still bore a remarkable resemblance to Elder
Tai-Po.</p>
<p>Charged with vigor, her lean body responded and she attacked the box once
more, reigning one heavy blow after another on the carefully drawn sinister
face. She lunged and parried from alternating angles, a skilled dancer in the
art of combat.</p>
<p>Anxiety had been building inside her since waking up in the palace infirmary
a week ago and the forceful activity helped her deal with it. Her ship had
crashed, her crew was dead and nine hundred and thirty-five years had passed.
She did not know how the hyperspace jump into the future had been accomplished
and unfortunately could not repeat it. She was doomed to remain exactly where
she was, in a world that chose to enslave her.</p>
<p>On top of all that, she had to contend with the Holy Empress of Dethra, the
dangerous child-woman who dropped her to her knees with torturous pain just by
touching her Ruler's bracelet. The young woman was anything but holy. She
obviously wanted a distraction from the pressures of leadership and decided that
seducing a slave was the way to have some fun. </p>
<p>In this world Ramsey had nothing. She needed a purpose beyond survival,
although that would do for now. She concentrated on Tai-Po. 'Take him out.' That
was her mission and her body responded as it had been trained to do in the
familiar, streamlined comfort of the combat zone. She reveled in it until
nothing else mattered.</p>
<p>Her slave moved like the warriors of old in Library holograms. And, just as
Sarika had been affected the first time she saw the dark woman in her garden,
she was gripped by a fierce longing that compelled her to respond. She
approached her slave, but then she drew back with a gasp.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop!&quot; the empress ordered. Ramsey's hands were covered with
blood. &quot;Stop it!&quot; she demanded again, with stronger authority.</p>
<p>So intent was Ramsey on her target that she did not hear and continued the
relentless, rhythmic thrusts that hit her mark with accuracy and power.</p>
<p>Why was she punishing herself? Was that the image of Tai-Po? Sarika stilled
an absurd urge to laugh and stood beside her much-abused strong box. This time
she spoke softly.</p>
<p>&quot;You have killed him-- you can stop now.&quot;</p>
<p>She gave Sarika a dark, smoldering look before her sky blue eyes flashed with
recognition. She grunted unintelligibly with the effort it took to stop. Her
fists hung in mid-air while her breath came hard and fast. Ramsey had performed
brilliantly as a military officer in her former life. Even now she looked ready
to conquer. Ready to conquer anything - or anyone. Sarika ran her tongue over
her moist lips before lowering her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Your hands-- &quot;</p>
<p>&quot; --are fine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They aren't. You're bleeding. Are you trying to scare me-- or
just break into my treasure box?&quot; Sarika asked with disapproval. &quot;The
things inside are priceless.&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey dropped her bloody hands and looked around the room. &quot;I'm a
soldier. It's who I am. This,&quot; she drew a circle in the air while
explaining to the empress, &quot;is the only space I've had to exercise…&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who you are-- is mine,&quot; she reacted to the person before her
quickly. Hers. Her soldier, and for some reason, much more valuable to her than
what was in the strong box. &quot;You were always destined to be mine.&quot;
Sarika reached out to caress her hot cheek and Ramsey flinched away.</p>
<p>&quot;I have the right-- to touch you. &quot;Sarika reached out again and
this time Ramsey allowed the soft hand to rest gently on her face. She let her
head be drawn down until she felt the young woman's breath warm against her
lips.</p>
<p><br>
&quot;When it comes to my destiny,&quot; Ramsey explained in a low,
matter-of-fact tone, &quot;freedom is the only thing I consider inevitable,
Empress.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika shuddered and let go, hair shimmering as it cascaded down below her
shoulders when she raised her chin even higher than before. She stepped back.</p>
<p>&quot;In the future, you will do soldiering things only in the next chamber.
I'll supply what you need and you may have the room as your own-- but you will
come to me at night. I'll make no further compromises with you.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika moved away and then turned back.</p>
<p>&quot;It's best that you prepare yourself now. You will be attending my
coronation this evening. Elder Tai-Po will be there. Tomorrow you'll begin
working with him to restore disrupters. I'll be checking while you work
together-- he dare not harm you anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are too kind,&quot; she smirked. &quot;At least the disrupters
won't kill the Menials they are used against....&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean the Rebels.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I meant slaves, the poor bast--&quot; Ramsey hesitated. &quot;They'll
just be blank slates for awhile. Come to think of it, this could be a blessing
in disguise. They never had much chance of winning. Needless deaths will be
prevented this way.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika let the sarcasm go. She was finding that she could tolerate much from
Ramsey. But there was a limit.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm glad you have confidence in the empire. You're under my protection
now. But no matter what you may think of Tai-Po, no matter how he treated you
when you belonged to him, he is an elder and a Ruler. You will respect his
position and his authority over you. That…&quot; Sarika pointed to the mangled
replica of Elder Tai-Po, &quot;must never happen again.&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey's face was devoid of emotion. &quot;On the other hand, Rebels probably
prefer death over slavery.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My duty is to keep order,&quot; the empress spoke as if she were
talking to a child, &quot;so don't speak of death to me. Ever. And I don't
intend to use the bracelet, so don't try to bait me by letting arrogance rule
your tongue. It is right for me to expect obedience from you and you'll learn to
accept your position. Now come-- it's my will that we serve each other equally
when we're in these chambers.&quot;</p>
<p>The dark woman raised an eyebrow. &quot;Equally?&quot; she asked, while
gathering her long damp hair behind her neck with stiffening fingers.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. I'm going to bathe you and bandage the hands you have abused. Your
injuries are not severe enough to ask the doctor to use the healer, are they? No
broken bones?&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Good. Then tonight, after the ceremony….&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot; And Ramsey shook her head again to negate the offer, if that
is what it was. The boundaries between them would never be equal. Not anywhere,
and especially not in these chambers. The empress had always been a ruler over
slaves. How could she comprehend someone like her - someone born neither a Ruler
nor a Menial?</p>
<p>&quot;I want to look after you.&quot; The youthful empress' eyes were
unusually round and very serious.</p>
<p>&quot;I've never done such things before. And I can't do it, except in
private. And you see-- &quot; suddenly she looked vulnerable, &quot;we're alone,
there is no one else here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean no disrespect Empress, and maybe you've always had people
waiting on you, but that's not me. I wouldn't be comfortable having someone--
bathe me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But there is something between us that I must explore.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What, a little bit of lust? How would it look if someone who's still a
child - and a Holy Empress no less - kept a…&quot; she said the last with
sarcasm, &quot;sex-slave?&quot;</p>
<p>The young woman's face fell. &quot;I'm certainly not a child, nor the first
empress to have a primal connection with a slave.&quot; Her chin lifted
with determination. &quot;You will be my lover.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There will never be any love between us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I need only our physical joining, but since you desire more, then yes,
Laren Ramsey, you will feel love for me.&quot;</p>
<p>She knew that Ramsey liked her touch. She liked it very much. And she felt
protective of her as well. It would be so easy to share a primal connection.</p>
<p>&quot;Love can't be coerced. And I don't desire anything from
you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But you do, Ramsey,&quot; she was getting to know the woman before
her. &quot;I won't need to use force with you,&quot; Sarika realized it was
true even as she said it. &quot;And strong as you are, as unforgivably stubborn
as you're being now, you can't stop what is happening. Your first thought was
for my safety this morning in the garden.&quot; The empress smiled, not wanting
to hide her pleasure.</p>
<p>Ramsey felt a tremor course through her. &quot;What game are you
playing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're both too old for games, Ramsey.&quot; The depth in her liquid
green eyes was startling. &quot;Don't you think so?&quot; Sarika smiled in
response to her slave's changed expression. She had given her something to think
about. &quot;There isn't much time before the ceremony but I'll summon Dr. Holis
to bring something to sooth your hands.&quot; She narrowed her eyes. &quot;And I
will get a robe for you.&quot;</p>
<p>Soon Cara arrived with medicinal herbal extracts and bandages, inquiring how
Ramsey received her injuries. Ramsey was the only one who could see the
astonishing conspirational little smile that found its way to Sarika's lips at
Cara's question and before she could answer, the empress did.</p>
<p>&quot;Promise not to tell anyone else, doctor?&quot; the empress inquired.</p>
<p>&quot;As you wish, Empress.&quot; The doctor, easily flustered in the
presence of the empress, was pleased that she had managed not to ramble yet.</p>
<p>Sarika tugged on the heavy, dented strong box and it slid into view from
behind her royal settee.</p>
<p>Cara chuckled. &quot;Oh! Strong hands, Ramsey.&quot;</p>
<p>The sovereign looked admiringly at her slave. &quot;She's very strong--&quot;
her eyes raked up and down, recalling parts of the tall body now hidden
&quot;--everywhere. The most beautiful person I've ever seen in my entire
life.&quot; And the doctor could not miss the sultry delight in Sarika's voice.</p>
<p>The major bore the shameless appraisal with stoic silence. The empress'
entire life up to this point was not all that long, she reminded herself.</p>
<i>
<p>'She's undergoing a new awareness of things</i>,' Cara thought, '<i>things
that would cause even me to blush if I were privy to them. It's very close to
her ritual-time. But truth now Cara, something about Ramsey makes you blush too,
and you have no such justification</i>.'</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps I should check elder Tai-Po for any psychic side effect,&quot;
Cara joked to prevent the mounting sexual tension from filling every centimeter
in the royal chamber.</p>
<p>Sobering, Sarika selected a tool from her desk and cut the Ruler's likeness
away from the box.</p>
<p>&quot;I trust you to dispose of this and say nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>Cara stuffed the evidence into her bag. She offered to wait and tend to the
patient herself but Sarika assured her it was not necessary.</p>
<p>&quot;Is there anything else I can do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is. Would you take Ramsey with you tonight? No Menial is
allowed to attend without a Ruler-- &quot;</p>
<p>She asked instead of ordering me. The doctor smiled at Ramsey while
answering. &quot;It would be my honor, Empress Sarika--my honor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you Cara.&quot;</p>
<p>The doctor loved diversions from the daily routine and the coronation tonight
would be an affair to remember despite the war going on. Cara was looking
forward to it, although her excitement was probably nothing compared to the
anticipation the new empress was experiencing. The royal emotions must be
soaring.</p>
<p>But this turn of events could cause an uproar among those supporting Tai-Po -
those who expected the empress to choose the elder as mate. The proud elder was
undoubtedly stung by his lowered status in the Council. But he still held
considerable political power. In fact, after the empress herself, Tai-Po was
second only to Melborne, the most respected elder in Dethra.</p>
<p>Cara left hoping Major Ramsey was as strong as she looked.</p>


<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Elder Tai-Po was well bred, powerful and everything she could never
really have. Celeste was unable to prevent herself from
responding to him and she moaned softly.</p>
<p>&quot;Be silent!&quot; he demanded.</p>
<p>His concentration was broken. Once again he began the process of
visualizing Sarika's body beneath him. He imagined it was the empress' skin that
flushed as he caressed soft contours of flesh, instead of the slave's whom he
had summoned to his chambers in secret.</p>
<p>Celeste had been ready for some time and although she wondered why the elder
did not penetrate her, she dared not ask.</p>
<p>He groaned and held her hands above her head, teasing her with his movements.</p>
<p>&quot;Please--&quot; she moaned.</p>
<p>His hand shot to her throat.</p>
<p>&quot;Quiet!&quot;</p>
<p>The pressure on her throat increased until each breath was a struggle. She
pulled at his hand but could not remove the viselike grip until he finally
ground out Sarika's name and shuddered. When he rolled away to rest on his back,
he breathed as deeply as she did. She waited until her respirations were easy
before washing herself in the adjoining bathroom. </p>
<p>Celeste was uncomfortably aware of the elder's selfishness, but he had the
right to think only of his needs. The fact that she wanted him even more because
of it was not something she analyzed - just as both of them knew that he took
her because she belonged to the empress, and never spoke of it.</p>
<p>She was not jealous. She knew her place in the order of the things. And until
the elder became Empress Sarika's mate, she would let him use her body to
pretend he already possessed her. She would simply put on her robe as she always
did and withdraw from his chambers - returning for his pleasure when he wanted
her, however he wanted her.</p>
<p>But as she prepared to leave Tai-Po pulled the robe from her hands and tilted
her head up.</p>
<p>&quot;Did I hurt you?&quot;</p>
<p>Celeste averted her face from him. Was he concerned about her? Her heart
pounded.</p>
<p>&quot;You excite me so much my little one,&quot; he crooned, holding her
while waiting for her to speak.</p>
<p>After a long pause she said she only wanted to serve him.</p>
<p>He stroked her hair absently. &quot;You serve me well, but next time you must
remember not to spoil the mood.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I try to remember-- I will.&quot; She wanted to remain in his embrace
but he sat her on a large chair and began to pace in front of her.
&quot;Oh!&quot; she exclaimed, remembering the coronation. &quot;The empress
will be calling for me soon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're both interested in her well-being, aren't we.&quot; The elder
stroked his mottled goatee. &quot;I don't trust Ramsey. She could be a rebel
infiltrator. At the very least she’s going to hurt the empress with her
strange ways. It’s up to us to secure her safety.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Us? What can we do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, I knew you would want to help.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well-- I have thought the newcomer is trouble because she talks-- like
a Rebel. But the empress likes her. In fact, this morning she told us that
Ramsey would be staying in her royal suite. They news of their relationship is--
growing. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My slaves say they're lovers. Are they?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If they are, I think the empress is making a mistake. You're the one
she should be turning to.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. She should, and she will. You understand the correct order
even before the empress. And because you do, I will share a secret with you.
Here--&quot; He picked up her robe and held it for her. She slid her arms in and
wrapped the brown cloth into place, tying off the belt.</p>
<p>&quot;I never knew my father,&quot; he continued while she dressed him in
return. Celeste was thrilled with the unprecedented intimacy between them.
&quot;He died before I was born. My mother told me that he received a prophetic
message about me even before he received word that he was going to have a
son.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He saved the life of a priestess who served Empress Sarika's
grandmother. After cleansing a village, the craft that was returning her to the
palace crashed. My father found her floating in the ocean off the eastern
continent, barely alive. She believed it was a miracle that he found her, and
foretold that his son's child would rule Dethra. So you see…&quot; he smiled
and showed uneven teeth to the spellbound slave who thought him most handsome,
&quot;…I am destined to be the Protector. I have known it all my life it
seems. I want to protect Empress Sarika and the Empire even now.&quot; He
was perfect.</p>
<p>&quot;What can I do to help?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will you let me know when the empress leaves the palace? I want to make
sure Ramsey doesn’t get the chance to kidnap her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kidnap? Oh, do you really think....&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wouldn’t put anything past a Rebel.&quot; Tai-Po cupped her chin.
&quot;We’re allies now. Call me Chen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Chen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, but only when we’re alone.&quot; His hard eyes narrowed.
&quot;Will you notify me as I asked?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will,&quot; she rose onto her toes and dared to kiss him on the
cheek, &quot;Chen.&quot; She had a special place in the order of the world, and
she thanked the Ancients.</p>


<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Celeste supervised Sarika's readiness for extraordinary occasions and
she arrived promptly after the empress summoned her for the final preparations.</p>
<p>&quot;Behira made the absolute best choice, empress. You're going to be the
most beautiful empress to wear the crown.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We all look pretty much alike,&quot; Sarika smiled indulgently.</p>
<p>&quot;But none had a gown like yours. I wonder where Priestess Behira had it
made?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't ask. It will be covered most of the time, but I agree. It's
beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes…the perfect choice for the most important event in a new
empress' life. You must be so excited--&quot; Celeste walked into the closet and
came back with the green robe, ominously tossing aside her initial determination
not to pry into the Empress' relationship with the new slave, but merely report
the information the elder asked for. &quot;--but are you sure Ramsey is the best
choice among your slaves to serve you in your chambers? She's not familiar with
palace affairs. She could cause embarrassment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Perhaps.&quot; Sarika put out her arms and let Celeste dress her.
&quot;No, not perhaps-- probably.&quot; Ramsey was the embodiment of an arrogant
slave, and she amended her statement a second time. &quot;Definitely. But she is
my choice.&quot;</p>
<p>Celeste eyed Sarika's attire and moved the royal sash higher up on her
shoulder. How Ramsey had gained such a position with the Empress in so short a
time could only be explained one way. She was different. She was bold and their
young empress was impressed. It frightened Celeste. Order should not be
forgotten, especially by the empress.</p>
<p>&quot;Does she know what's required of her?&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika laughed. &quot;Do you, Celeste?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're teasing. It's no secret what an empress needs during-- well,
during the stage you're going through.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you saying I've lost my better judgement....&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no Empress, only that-- well yes, something like that I guess.
People are saying that Ramsey is your favorite - and your lover. It's spreading
throughout the palace.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you're greatly disturbed by this gossip?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes! Ramsey is not like any slave I've ever seen. She doesn't fit in.
She's different. She acts-- she wants to be like a Ruler. Giving her a place
here can only bring trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika sat while her slave brushed her hair. &quot;Your concern is misplaced
Celeste-- I'm the thirteenth Holy Empress of Dethra after all, with or without
the infamous royal hormones.&quot; She added the last with a peculiar grimace.
&quot;I know Ramsey has a lot to learn about wearing the collar but that's only
because it's new to her. I'm educating her. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And while you're occupied with Ramsey, what thought are you giving to
the Protector?&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika's complexion suffused with a pink glow and Celeste knew she had gone
too far.</p>
<p>&quot;Forgive me Empress.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you so little respect?&quot; she asked in a hushed tone before
raising her voice. &quot;You are a greater liability to me than you think Ramsey
is.&quot;</p>
<p>Celeste was afraid and prostrated herself before her Empress. Seeing this,
Sarika's quick anger began to subside.</p>
<p>&quot;You forget your position-- but you are forgiven. Rise and never
again presume to suggest I am not fulfilling my duty.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Empress.&quot; Celeste arose, and when she straightened, her
collar shifted, revealing bruises.</p>
<p>&quot;Who hurt you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No one Empress.&quot; Her voice was shallow. &quot;I bruised
myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On the neck? When anyone harms you, they harm me. Tell me what
happened.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't noticed any marks. &quot;Please,&quot; she was close to
tears, &quot;may I take my leave?&quot;</p>
<p>With a mix of concern and irritation the empress dismissed Celeste, wondering
if all her slaves were going to resist her now.</p>


<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Ramsey sat in her own chamber soaking her hands when Sarika entered
from a side door connected to her own. Her light auburn hair was brushed to a
shimmering luster and her majestic robe accentuated her high cleavage and small
waist. The spirit shining from her eyes caught Ramsey with its unguarded
openness.</p>
<p>She sat close and breathed in the delicious warm scent of her slave before
taking each cold hand out of the bucket of ice - mostly melted to water. Gently
she dried them. &quot;Tell me if I hurt you,&quot; she instructed, and her voice
had a breathless quality that was strangely soothing. She gingerly applied
medicine across the raw knuckles. Ramsey's gaze followed every movement. Finally
the young sovereign wrapped clean, flesh-colored cloth around her hands. Ramsey
clenched her fists loosely and nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;Not too tight. Good. Thank you…Sarika.&quot;</p>
<p>The empress closed her eyes. Here senses were heightened and the rich,
approving voice speaking her name lured her forward. She placed light kisses on
the bandaged hands. When she looked up the blue eyes burned her with their
intensity. Sarika's throat felt dry and her fingers itched to touch the tanned
face.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you for letting me serve you, Major Laren Ramsey.&quot; She
needed to trace the contour of the smooth cheek and red lips - needed to feel
the soft silkiness of dark hair moving against her own skin. <i>'Love me</i>.'
Immoral or not, Sarika could not stop herself from mentally projecting her
desire. She stood forcing Ramsey to look up as her eyes followed.
She ran the back of her hand along the strong jaw, looking steadily into her
eyes. She was taming her soldier. <i>'Forget everything else.'</i> Slowly she
drew a finger across well-formed lips and her eyes followed the path. The
instant her senses took in the warm velvet skin of the soft lip sliding beneath
her finger the young empress stopped breathing. She could have been floating in
the air and not noticed or felt any different than she did now, so totally
absorbed was she in the unfolding moment. She leaned down, bringing her mouth
close to Ramsey's. So very close….</p>
<p>Mindless, Ramsey parted her lips…..</p>
<p>&quot;Major Ramsey, It's Doctor Holis.&quot; Cara chose that instant to
announce her arrival through the communication panel outside the chamber door.</p>
<p>With an abrupt groan, Sarika moved away.</p>
<p>&quot;Time to go to the auditorium. Ramsey? Are you ready? &quot; Cara
waited.</p>
<p>Sarika's voice was raw with frustration and something else that was becoming
equally familiar to her. &quot;I'll be waiting for you in the reception
hall following the coronation. Don't forget to come to me. And,&quot; she added
with a shy smile, &quot;I-- I'm looking forward to tonight.&quot;</p>
<p>The two of them existed in a world filled with expectancy and stunned, more
by the suddenly demure behavior of the Empress than by the potent jolt of pure
sensuality preceding it, Ramsey nodded. Her black hair moved like silk
around her face. Thick black lashes framed her exquisite eyes. She made Sarika's
chest ache even after she left the chamber.</p>


<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>&quot;I'd like to talk with you Cara.
Would you mind if we took the stairs instead of the elevator?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, but when I start wheezing you'll have to put up with me,&quot; the
gray-haired doctor grinned.</p>
<p>&quot;What’s on your mind, Ramsey?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's no delicate way to put this--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No need to be delicate. We're getting older by the second so just say
what you have to say and I'll do the same.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That sounds like something my father would say.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A wise man.&quot;</p>
<p>The tall beauty hesitated so Cara continued. &quot;Look, if this is about the
empress, let me assure you that I'll keep whatever you say in confidence. Just
don't ask me to help you become a runaway or something. I won't do that. You'd
be caught and I'd be executed along with you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, it's nothing like that--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So talk then.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I need some advice.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll do my best to advise you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks. The thing is-- the problem is-- the empress is bored.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really, you think so?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think it's obvious. And she is-- that is, she has--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whenever we're alone, she tries to-- uh-- seduce me.&quot;</p>
<p>Cara's lips formed a mute 'O' of astonishment. &quot;And she hasn't
succeeded?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, but she sort of mesmerizes me and it's-- hey! I'm serious.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can see that. I'm sorry Ramsey.&quot; Cara suppressed her giggles.
&quot;I forgot that there's much about Dethra you don't understand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, and I could really use some help here. Do you know of something -
anything - that I can use to distract the empress?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To make her forget about sex?&quot; Cara grinned widely.</p>
<p>&quot;Is this really humorous to you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry. Meant no harm. But the only thing that will distract
the empress is time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Time?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's right. A young empress undergoes enormous hormonal changes when
she becomes an adult. Her telekinetic center is enlarging and she's growing into
the fullness of her power. It's the amazing way their brain works. -- You and I
have the same bioactive endocrine functions, but hers are much more-- active.
And it seems she has focused a large part of all that activity on you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not me? Because-- because we disagree about something very basic to
our relationship-- the whole thing of slavery-- because I didn't travel a
thousand years just to lose my crew and end up a plaything for-- for a
sexually-obsessed teenager!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop there Major!&quot; Cara gripped her arm and in her anger Ramsey
pulled her down several stairs before she finally stopped.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Ramsey glared.</p>
<p>&quot;Think about where we're going. You're talking about someone who is
sacred. Not just to me, but to the world. Her power makes her the perfect
conduit for The Source. Her ancestors kept the world alive, and so will she. And
all that is possible because of a genetic anomaly that each empress passes on to
her daughter. The increased sexual drive is an unfortunate side effect that will
be dealt with to the best of the priestesses' ability on her eighteenth
birthday-- if they still need to, that is. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And how soon will that be? Why wouldn't they need to?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Twelve days. On the day and hour of her birth, the priestess will
conduct the Rite of Womanhood for her. It's all very secret and mystical. Then
she will officially be asked to chose a mate, if she hasn't already done so. Her
mate automatically becomes the Protector of Dethra, which is why I hope she
doesn't pick Elder Tai-Po.&quot; Ramsey may as well know all of it since she had
an important part to play. Cara resumed her way down the stairs and a startled
Ramsey followed, quickly overtaking her.</p>
<p>&quot;Tai-Po? Why would she pick him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because he's the only single elder. And he wants the position.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I'll bet,&quot; Ramsey smirked, disgusted with the whole
situation. &quot;Aren't there any others?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nearly a dozen wealthy Rulers have tried to court her, but I'd say
Tai-Po has managed to discourage them all. I haven't seen any of them around the
palace for weeks.&quot; Cara was finding it difficult to catch her breath as
they continued down the long stairwell. &quot;Slow down Ramsey, your legs are
longer than they have a right to be,&quot; she puffed.</p>
<p>&quot;Can't she just refuse?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sure she can refuse, but the consequences would compromise her
health.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean she'll get sick if she doesn't lose her virginity? That's
awfully dramatic, doctor. Why doesn't she just-- just-- you know…?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Her needs can't be satisfied by autoerotic activity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't tell me. -- It's against her religion, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It has nothing to do with issues of morality Ramsey. It's simply that a
telepathic kinetic bonding is essential for an empress and that is only possible
with a partner.&quot; Cara tried her best to put something that was beyond
physical science and rarely discussed into a framework that a military mind like
Ramsey's could appreciate. &quot;Nothing short of her partner's physiological
crisis, or orgasm - acting as a trigger, or more like a release valve -
can discharge the pressure building against her telekinetic center. Without that
release, she would become ill and eventually die. Yes, it is very dramatic. Be
thankful you don't have to go through it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think I am going through it with her,&quot; Ramsey mused darkly,
having gotten more information than she wanted to know. &quot;So, the empress
hopes to use me as a release valve until she mates with Tai-Po.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, well, I suppose you could think of it that way. The priestesses
would still perform the ritual but it would be a modified version I imagine, and
she would no longer have the pressure of needing to choose a mate until she
needs to produce an heiress. I don't think she likes Tai-Po.</p>
<p>She may want to keep you around for a long time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Keep me around?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, probably.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shit! Cara, I can't do this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Try to look on the bright side. She's not bad to look at....&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey cut her off at the end of the stairwell. &quot;She's a child!&quot;</p>
<p>Cara raised her brow. &quot;Hardly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You've been no help at all, doctor.&quot;</p>


<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Tapestry offering muted colors and a two dimensional perspective, in
the style of the Middle Ages, hung from the walls of the auditorium. Huge and
impressive, the tapestries depicted the lives of twelve empresses of Dethra.
After tonight, they would begin to include the thirteenth.</p>
<p>Music filled the air and it too was festive and oddly reminiscent to Laren
Ramsey.</p>
<p>She and Dr. Holis received curious stares, some less than friendly. Ramsey
wished she could make a general announcement that she had no plans of changing
the status quo at the palace. But, she realized such a declaration would make no
difference to most of these people who knew her only by descriptions passed
during the course of gossip. And the empress apparently did have plans to
use her to change the course of affairs.</p>
<p>She said hello to Talbert who patted her on the back and thanked her again
for fixing the biosystem. Celeste pretended she did not notice her as she passed
by and by the time she made it to her seat, she was ready for Elder Tai-Po's
cold glance. She nodded her head in acknowledgment. The thought of spending time
with him in the days to come revolted her.</p>
<p>Horns blared abruptly. The arrival of &quot;Her Holiness, Empress Sarika
Dethra&quot; was announced and a hush fell over the throng of people. &quot;On
this, the night of her coronation,&quot; the announcer continued, &quot;everyone
is granted the privilege of looking fully at her Holiness until she leaves the
auditorium.&quot; The Royal Guard surrounded Sarika while she slowly marched to
the cadence of the processional toward the front of the immense room.</p>
<p>She seemed impossibly young for her title. Head held high, she gave Ramsey a
lingering glance as she passed. She was, the major acknowledged, stunning.</p>
<p>Melborne, the senior elder, and Behira, the oldest of priestesses, met Sarika
on a platform where they had been attentively waiting. The elder bowed before
her and declared his loyalty to the new empress. The crowd cheered with
enthusiasm when he draped a golden cloak around her shoulders. When he stepped
behind her it was Behira's turn, and she came close to the young woman's side to
hold a simple gold crown over her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I am a vessel for The Source,&quot; Sarika replied, her voice sure and
clear.</p>
<p>&quot;What is your destiny?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To cleanse the world, as my mothers before me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; she asked again.</p>
<p>&quot;I am the foundation of order.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What is your destiny?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To govern Dethra as my mothers before me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How will you fulfill your destiny?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By the authority given to me by my mother, who is now one with The
Source.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Reveal to us your authority.&quot;</p>
<p>The old priestess lowered the crown until it rested on top of the beautiful
head. It fit perfectly and immediately radiated white, glowing light. Sarika
surveyed the crowd and the light dimmed. She found the electric blue gaze of her
tall slave and took it in. Her crown glowed with a brilliance that quickly grew
until it was blinding and so hot Sarika had to remove it. Once removed, the
crown returned to its original golden state. It took several more minutes for
Sarika herself to stop glowing.</p>
<p>Even though she was engrossed in the display of power and the radiant young
empress, Priestess Behira was still mindful to assure the crowd, and the
empress, that all was well.</p>
<p>She bowed down. &quot;You are the vessel of The Source,&quot; she announced
with adoration. Upon rising she whispered to Sarika, &quot;Put your crown back
on, but keep your eyes off the tall one for now.&quot;</p>
<p>One-by-one, the twenty-two remaining priestesses and elders made there way to
the platform to pledge their loyalty and bow before the empress.</p>
<p>Slowly Ramsey came out of her trance-like state to discover Dr. Holis had a
painful grip on her arm.</p>
<p>&quot;Wha--? Cara what is it?&quot; she asked while she loosened the doctor's
hand.</p>
<p>&quot;By the ancients! Didn't you feel it?&quot;</p>
<p>The dark-haired woman slumped in her chair. &quot;I-- I need to lie
down.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How can you possibly be tired after that?&quot; Cara whispered to her.</p>
<p>Heavy lids closed over her blue eyes and the dark head dropped just before
she fell forward onto the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;Ramsey!&quot; Cara yelled, and all eyes turned toward them.</p>
<p>Within seconds guards were telling the doctor to move away from the stricken
slave but Cara continued to feel for the beat of her heart.</p>


<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>In the infirmary Cara finished a third scan of Ramsey's body. The
results were the same.</p>
<p>Sarika's hands hovered over her unconscious slave's face. Afraid of hurting
her, she wrapped her arms around herself to keep from touching the still form.</p>
<p>&quot;Why is she unconscious?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Psychophysiological over-stimulation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cara, please-- what does that mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Exhaustion. She's-- well, she's completely depleted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But she was fine less than an hour ago. More than fine, except for her
hands.&quot; Just remembering how Ramsey looked as they gazed at each other
earlier caused Sarika to shiver pleasurably. Her slave had radiated with
irrepressible life. &quot;And she didn't exert herself unduly since then.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's another thing.&quot; Cara removed the bandages.
&quot;Look.&quot; There was no evidence of injury.
&quot;I have to say I suspect her current condition has something to do with the
coronation ceremony Empress-- the part where you were shining-- well, glowing
really.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't glow, the crown glows.&quot;</p>
<p>Cara smiled. &quot;Well, you definitely lit up this evening. I felt something
--it was quite stimulating-- while you ….Really, it was the most
amazing--&quot; she stopped to remind herself not to ramble and looked down at
Ramsey, &quot;...at least to me. Your telekinetic power is growing, and it seems
our patient got more than her share of whatever it was….&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was The Source, flowing through me-- more powerfully than I knew it
could.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes well, it certainly overpowered our time-traveler.&quot;</p>
<p>Behira made her presence felt. &quot;Empress Sarika, please, I must speak
with you-- alone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I understand.&quot; She looked around the sterile infirmary, then
lowered her head. It was her fault. She had wanted her slave to see her in all
her sovereign glory- to entice her.</p>
<p>&quot;Will she be all right? Is there anything I can do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes well, she needs a good rest. Undisturbed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course. I will have her taken to her chambers and see to it that no
one wakes her.&quot; They both knew the empress was the only one in a position
to disturb her slave.</p>
<p>Cara injected supplements that would bolster her immune system into the
pronounced vein of her inner arm. Sarika bit her bottom lip at the sight of the
beveled needle puncturing soft skin, as if it were entering her own flesh.</p>
<p>&quot;How long?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Until she wakes up, I'd say.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm just a doctor. I know less about The Source - and what Major Ramsey
has been through - than you do.&quot; Cara was drawn to look into the forbidden
green eyes and she communicated her concern. &quot;It is best to let nature take
its course.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I-- Yes, Cara. That seems like the best thing to do.&quot;</p>
<p>Priestess Behira waited for Sarika in the royal chambers while the empress
saw to it that her slave was transferred safely to the her own new bed in her
own chamber.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me know when she awakens. She and Elder Tai-Po have important work
to do with disrupters as soon as possible,&quot; she informed the guard. At
least the change will put an end to the gossip. Celeste would be glad. After a
wistful glance at Ramsey's sleeping form, she left.</p>
<p>She met Behira and removed her crown and cloak, relieved when the priestess
suggested they share a time of meditation to relax before their talk. That was
what she needed.</p>
<p>But after she joined herself mentally with the golden-robbed priestess, she
was still unable to let go of the restlessness she felt. Her inner turmoil
transferred to Behira as a lack of confidence and the old woman pulled back with
concern.</p>
<p>&quot;Both your grandmother and your mother called me friend. Now I serve
you, Holiness.&quot; She waited with calm expectancy.</p>
<p>Sarika gave a little smile, then brushed her auburn bangs with her hand and
moved her hair long behind her ears, complimenting her youth.</p>
<p>&quot;Like my mother, I value the friendship of a wise woman. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're very much like your mother was. Vilell also had a difficult time
choosing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did she? I didn’t know.&quot; Sarika's eyes widened.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes, she resisted the idea, and on the day of her birthday your
grandmother chose for her. She picked the only elder who was single.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika shuddered, thinking that history was going to be repeated. &quot;My
parents weren't close,&quot; Sarika said flatly and then sighed in resignation.
Her mother had told her little of their relationship but she believed she knew
that much.</p>
<p>&quot;No they weren't, but they learned to care for each other. Your mother
was heartbroken when your father died so soon after your birth. She said he gave
her something more valuable than passion, something that she would always
treasure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What. What was it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You.&quot;</p>
<p>The empress raised her chin and did her best to hold back her tears. As a
priestess, Behira had considerable privilege and could look into the eyes of the
empress, now filled with pain.</p>
<p>&quot;I miss her too,&quot; the wizened old woman revealed. &quot;It's all
right, cry now and I'll not respect you any less. </p>
<p>Sarika let the old woman hold her and was comforted while she cried. When the
tears waned, Behira hoped the empress was ready to trust her.</p>
<p>&quot;I ask permission to speak of private matters.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I- I thought that's what we were already doing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;More private, then.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have my permission.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I saw how you looked at the tall one tonight. Your concern for her is
evident.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She's important to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is more than that I suspect.&quot; Sarika behaved like a woman in
love. &quot;Are you sharing a primal connection with her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No--&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika closed her eyes and recalled how the light from the Sun glistened on
Ramsey's long black hair and olive skin when they first met. How she reeled when
she saw the exotic blue of her eyes. The aura of strength that surrounded her
was stimulating and different. She had been filled with longing for her before
Ramsey collapsed tonight and changed everything. The next time she used her
telekinetic powers it could be even harder on her slave if she were nearby - so
strong was her yearning for her. When she opened her eyes, tears threatened to
hide their green intensity. She rested her head against the thin shoulder of the
priestess.</p>
<p>&quot;--but to be honest, I did try. Oh Behira, you know everyone expects me
to choose Elder Tai-Po as a mate. He certainly wants to be the Protector badly
enough, but I don’t like him. I was going to take Ramsey as a lover until I’m
ready to name a Protector. She's attractive to me--&quot; she sighed,
&quot;--she is very attractive. But I-- I know now that nothing can come of
it.&quot; Sarika's brow furrowed and her lower lip became distended, warning of
her displeasure. &quot;And I know what my duty is, but I won’t chose until I
find the one I want to share a child with. I won't do it Behira.&quot;</p>
<p>The priestess moved away from the empress slightly, encouraging Sarika to
look at her.</p>
<p>&quot;I must tell you what has been revealed to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A prophecy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In a way. Tonight, when you took off the crown, you were glowing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So the doctor said.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In all my years with your mother and grandmother, I only saw such a
thing one time. I was at the ceremony when your mother's egg, prepared with
enough of your father's genes to create you, was planted inside her womb. The
instant it was accomplished, Empress Vilell was filled with a bright light for
several minutes, like you-- today.</p>
<p>Sarika tilted her head. &quot;Are you saying you think I'm pregnant?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An immaculate conception by the power of The Source?&quot; Her voice
was laced with sarcasm.</p>
<p>&quot;With some help from the tall one, yes. It seems the choice of who your
mate -and the Protector of Dethra - will be, has already been made for you by
the Ancestors.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika paled. &quot;What you saw tonight couldn't possibly mean what you're
saying.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I saw your power fading until you looked at the tall one. I heard a
multitude of voices saying clearly 'this is the Protector, with whom we are well
pleased' and you were filled with light-- life energy not from The Source, but
from the tall one. Part of her was given to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And this is what you believe?&quot; Sarika did not know if she wanted
to laugh or cry or just call the old woman mad.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe what I have seen and heard, yes. The process is opposite of
what our tradition has been, but who are we to question the will of The Source?
Dr. Holis can tell us if I am insane or not,&quot; she cackled. &quot;Will you
humor an old priestess?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You've been hallucinating. That's what I think. But,
because I respect you- not because I believe what you are saying Behira- I'll
disturb the doctor one more time today.</p>
<p>&quot;But do you want it to be true?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I would be overjoyed if my power was not a threat to her-- if we could
share ourselves as lovers do. But do I want to have a child with Ramsey? She's a
slave. I am-- who I am. What would that make our offspring, no matter how
conceived? What would that do to the order of the world? I can't even imagine
it. Why would the Ancestors do such a thing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed,&quot; Behira sobered while the empress called Cara to meet them
in the infirmary.</p>


<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Riding her favorite horse on the family ranch in Texas was a dream
that gave the major a refuge and she was reluctant to let it go. But finally,
her body demanded consciousness and she opened her eyes.</p>
<p>The empress slept in a chair by her bedside. Blond eyelashes cast subtle
shadows reaching to the crest of her pink cheeks. '<i>Like an angel. Without a
seductive movement or impatient demand to give away the complexity of her true
nature. They believe she is sacred because she has a special power and can
manipulate molecules with her mind. But whatever enables her to do that is
making her like me- a slave, driven by her own body so she can &quot;save the
world&quot;'.</i> The empress stirred and whispered Ramsey's name in her sleep.
'<i>And who will save me from you, Sarika?'</p>
</i>
<p>Uncoiling fully from the deep sleep she had been in, the dark woman stretched
her long arms and legs as far as they would go and then curled her hands and
feet, emitting a satisfied groan. She stopped suddenly and looked at her hands.</p>
<p>&quot;You're awake,&quot; Sarika blinked and sat up straight.</p>
<p>&quot;So are you.&quot; Ramsey yawned. &quot;Sorry I fell out during the
ceremony. The thousand-year time change must've finally caught up with me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So it would seem.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My hands. Did Cara use the healer after all?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. The power of The Source touched you last night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah? That's why I blacked out?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's the verdict of the experts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're being mysterious. And you look troubled. What's wrong? Are you
upset that you compromised with me after all?&quot; she rolled her eyes,
indicating her bed. She spent the night in her own chamber, and Sarika had
supplied her with her own bed.</p>
<p>&quot;No. You needed to rest. There's nothing for you to worry about,&quot;
Sarika answered while she watched her slave run strong fingers through her mane
of long black hair. She wanted nothing more than to join her in bed and forget
everything else. But she could not do that. There was business to attend to now.
&quot;How do you feel?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Better than I have in-- oh-- about a thousand years,&quot; Ramsey
smirked as an odd humor came over her. She rose dramatically, pulling a
soft bedsheet with her to cover her nakedness. &quot;And now I'm ready to go to
work for you my empress, to do your bidding and put an end to the Rebellion that
threatens your empire,&quot; she said half-joking. </p>
<p>Her long legs seemed to go on and on, Sarika noticed with appreciation, not
really hearing what was being said.</p>
<p>&quot;Damn, if that doesn't sound just like a line from one of those old Star
Wars movies or something,&quot; Ramsey laughed. &quot;I've seen them all. And
you, empress, don’t have a clue about what I'm talking about do you? Say, do I
have time to shower before I go? Maybe get some breakfast? I'm starving. Hello?
Luke Skywalker, to Princess Leah. You awake in there?&quot;</p>
<p>The empress remembered the Rebellion and the disrupters waiting to be
restored. &quot;Yes- yes, of course. I'll inform Elder Tai-Po and a guard will
escort you to the Garrison after we eat. My pilot will fly you both over.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good. I shall be ready my empress,&quot; Ramsey grinned.</p>
<p>Sarika's smile was barely noticeable.</p>
<p>As Ramsey showered she wondered what seemed different about Sarika. She was
subdued and had an underlying look of anxiety when she first woke. Like someone
who just got notice that they were fighting a losing battle - and being sent to
the frontline. Haunted. Whatever was troubling her must be big, and it did not
seem to be the Rebellion.</p>


<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Under Elder Chen Tai-Po's watchful eye Ramsey began to rebuild the
disrupters. She enjoyed working with the familiar equipment and her work
progressed more rapidly than Tai-Po had anticipated. Ramsey passed the first of
the hand held weapons to the elder. It fit neatly into his palm.</p>
<p>When focused on a living organism, disrupter beams altered bioelectric
processes. For humans the result was a temporary catatonic state followed by
amnesia. It rendered an enemy confused and helpless for a period of days. The
Rebels would soon forget why they were fighting and be captured without a fight.
The elder admired the weapon in his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you know that Empress Sarika and I are going to be mated?&quot; He
was pleased to see Ramsey's eyes widen. &quot;Oh yes. She is going to make me
The Protector and our child will become heir to the throne. And you--&quot; he
pointed the weapon at her, squinting one eye until it closed while he aligned
the front and rear sights, &quot;…dear slave--&quot; uneven teeth were
revealed in his tight-lipped grin &quot;…will be ancient history once
again.&quot; He lowered the weapon and laughed at the relief evident in Ramsey's
face. &quot;But first I get to play.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We've got work to do. There's no time for your sadistic games.&quot;
Under her breath she added, &quot;And you sure as hell don't have enough class
to be as entertaining as Darth Vader.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey picked up a tool and began dismantling another disrupter.</p>
<p>&quot;Bah! Who would have guessed you could be so boring Major. Don't you
know there's always time to get pleasure out of work? Come here. I have
something to show you.&quot;</p>
<p>Reluctantly Ramsey followed Tai-Po into the next room. A bloodied figure lay
in chains on the floor. The elder kicked at the huddled form.</p>
<p>&quot;Get up Rebel.&quot; He kicked again, harder. &quot;I said get up, you
traitor!&quot;</p>
<p>The man on the floor struggled to his knees before impatience got the best of
Tai-Po and he pulled him up by the chains that bound him.</p>
<p>&quot;Talbert!&quot; Ramsey breathed.</p>
<p>He coughed and opened reddened eyes. &quot;Ramsey? Are we-- in the
garrison?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; Ramsey put a chair beside him and gently urged him to sit.</p>
<p>&quot;Touching reunion,&quot; the elder sneered.</p>
<p>&quot;He needs a doctor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not until he gives me the information I want.&quot; Tai-Po smiled
calmly at the annoyingly tall woman. &quot;Tell me where the Rebel camp is
located.&quot;</p>
<p>Talbert coughed again. &quot;You know I can't tell you that Elder.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course you can,&quot; he replied dryly and retrieved a pen-sized
device from his tunic. &quot;Your friend is no less than a Rebel spy, like you
Major Ramsey. You fooled our young empress, but not me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm no spy, and I doubt Talbert is either.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No? He was caught sending a message that gave away our plans to use
disrupters. Now the Rebels have retreated, probably to construct shields to
protect them from this,&quot; he held up the disrupter before tucking it back
into his belt.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, how do you suppose Talbert knew about the disrupters?&quot; Tai-Po
placed the long, thin object into Talbert's ear and within seconds he cried out
a bloodcurdling scream. Tiny wisps of smoke curled out of his ear. The elder
asked quietly, &quot;Who told you?&quot;</p>
<p>The slave caught his breath. &quot;Please-- N--no one t-t-told me. I
overheard the g-guards who watched Ramsey l-last night…w-when they changed
shifts. That's all. One s-said you and Ramsey would be d-doing some important
work with d-d-disrupters. They were s-stumped. They didn't know what disrupters
were. I d-didn’t either-- until I did research in the l-library.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's your lucky day Ramsey. I'm going to give you this opportunity to
convince me you're not a spy.&quot; Tai-Po held out the device to her. &quot;Get
the location of the Rebel camp.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I told you-- I leave the politics to the politicians.&quot; She walked
to the door and then dropped to knees. Searing pain engulfed her, robbing her of
breath and all other awareness. When her vision cleared the elder's
self-satisfied grin greeted her.</p>
<p>&quot;I do believe the empress is spoiling you. A slave is not allowed to
walk away from a Ruler until dismissed, remember?&quot;</p>
<p>A short series of beeps got his attention. He spoke into one of the bands
circling his wrist. &quot;Type your message.&quot; A message from Celeste
appeared. The empress and one of her priestesses were on their way to the
garrison.</p>
<p>&quot;Get up Major. Our pleasure-time is over-- for now.&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey's legs were unsteady but they supported her. &quot;Bastard!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You just cost Talbert some teeth,&quot; the elder smiled.
&quot;Remember, any tales to the empress will cost him an exquisitely painful
death.&quot; The cursed woman was soft and he knew how to use that
trait.</p>
<p>Ramsey sat at her desk and forced her hands to stop shaking before she
resumed her work.</p>
<p>Tai-Po was a gracious host when Sarika and Behira arrived, bowing to them
both and kissing Sarika's hand. He proceeded to give her a tour of the Garrison
but avoided the room that held Talbert.</p>
<p>&quot;I can see much has been done since I was here last. But where is
Ramsey?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Behira added, &quot;Where is she? I want to meet the
person who has traveled such a great distance to join us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In the main room. We're headed there now. The Menial is slow I'm
afraid, but I hope to have the disrupters ready by tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as her eyes found the dark-headed slave Sarika was pleased. She
grabbed Behira's hand while she walked across the stone floor, Tai-Po following
behind them.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello.&quot;</p>
<p>The major looked up and Sarika's chest constricted at the coldness in her
ice-blue eyes before Ramsey remembered to avert her glance. No familiarities
with the empress were allowed in public. She stood so that she could bow
properly. </p>
<p>&quot;Empress,&quot; she greeted her. A curtain of long sable hair swept
forward like precious silk, softening the sovereign heart beyond measure. </p>
<p>&quot;Ramsey, I want you to meet Priestess Behira.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Priestess,&quot; Ramsey acknowledged the introduction with another bow.</p>
<p>&quot;Give me your hands,&quot; the old woman requested.</p>
<p>Ramsey obliged her and Tai-Po peered over the priestess' frail shoulder with
undisguised interest.</p>
<p>&quot;You came from the past, did you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You were summoned.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, my ship crashed here. Good soldiers lost their lives.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Ancients brought you, even so. Everything that happens has a
purpose. Come to me when you return to the palace,&quot; instructed the old
woman. She dropped the major's large hands.</p>
<p>&quot;It isn't safe, Priestess….&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What isn't safe, elder?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Forgive my concern if you think it unnecessary Priestess Behira, but it
may not be wise to be alone with a slave as new to the palace as
Ramsey.&quot; Tai-Po desperately wanted to tell her that Ramsey was a
danger to her, to Empress Sarika and everyone else, but he knew of Behira's
stubbornness and that the empress was not yet ready to accept the truth about
the slave.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not afraid Elder Tai-Po.&quot; Behira looked deep into
Ramsey's startlingly clear blue eyes and saw Dethra's future. &quot;In
fact,&quot; she added, &quot;I can honestly say I trust the tall one.&quot;</p>
<p>The elder's chagrined grimace lay hidden under the hand that smoothed his
motley goatee. </p>
<p>&quot;How is your work progressing?&quot; Sarika asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Not as fast as I hoped, but....&quot; he began to assess until he was
cut off by a gesture from Sarika.</p>
<p>&quot;Ramsey?&quot; Sarika asked pointedly of her slave, placing her small
hand lightly upon the woman's forearm.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm working on the second of the smaller hand-held disrupters
now.&quot; She kept her gaze averted and wondered at the
inexplicable sensation the empress' touch had created.</p>
<p>&quot;Elder, escort Priestess Behira to my shuttle and wait for me
there,&quot; the empress ordered.</p>
<p>&quot;But ….&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now. There's no danger here and I wish to speak with her
alone.&quot;</p>
<p>Lips tightening to painfully thin lines, he left the room with Behira.</p>
<p>Sarika moved closer to the dark woman. She waited until blue eyes were
finally directed at her and for a moment she forgot everything except the beauty
of the woman. Finally she found her voice. &quot;Show me your work&quot; she
said softly.</p>
<p>Ramsey turned around and sat. She picked up a tool and the partially
dismantled weapon. The empress was so close that her backside grew warm from the
heat of the body behind her. Angling the toolpoint inside the metal casing, the
major's jaw clenched involuntarily while she probed until she heard a series of
clicks and the final plate came free. &quot;There's what I want,
just to the left of the morphotic amplification lense.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; Sarika replied more softly than before, leaning even further
forward until her cheek rested against Ramsey's neck. Ramsey became very
still while royal hands traveled up her shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;What would you do if you weren't a slave?&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey put down the weapon when the unexpected question registered. &quot;Is
that an offer?&quot; The empress did not answer and Ramsey sighed. It was
not an offer of freedom. That was something her owner would never give to
her. &quot;I'd travel the world a while if I could.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Probably join the Rebellion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You would fight against me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't forgotten my vow to tell you the truth. Given the
opportunity I'd fight against oppression, yes. That's what I committed to when I
became a soldier. It's what's in my blood.</p>
<p>&quot;But you said they couldn't win.</p>
<p>&quot;I could win.&quot;</p>
<p>Her slave's arrogance caused an unwanted thrill to run a tingling course down
her spine. She breathed deeply, appreciating Ramsey's stirring scent.
&quot;And if I freed the slaves, what would you do then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'd be a soldier without a cause. Like I am now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have a cause for you,&quot; Sarika rubbed her cheek against Ramsey's
neck and felt her stiffen.</p>
<p>&quot;I know,&quot; the dark woman frowned. She hesitated, then pulled
away. &quot;I'm trying to work on it.&quot; The
disrupter in her hand was unrecognizable at the moment. Where was the
landmark lense she found so easily just a minute ago?</p>
<p>The empress stood in front of her, the workbench between them, and removed
the firearm from her hand, laying it down. &quot;You know what I want.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Doctor Holis says you're in heat.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika smiled. &quot;Is that what Cara said?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My interpretation. She used words I never heard of before.&quot; Ramsey
looked away again. &quot;I asked if she knew some way you could be
distracted.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did you? What did the doctor say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot; Sarika glanced at the strong pair of hands resting on the
table before her eyes found her lips and lingered there. &quot;Satisfaction.
That's what I need--.&quot; She slowly raised her gaze. &quot;If we hadn't been
interrupted you would have kissed me again last night.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You would've kissed me,&quot; Ramsey corrected. </p>
<p>&quot;Why do you resist me so strongly?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our relationship is not balanced.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can forget you're a slave when we're alone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Neither of us can forget that. And you're far too young for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a grown woman.&quot; It was only a matter of days before the Rite.</p>
<p>&quot;I was speaking of your emotional age. But a literal
interpretation works too- since you're about a thousand years younger than
me.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika's frustration was growing. &quot;No one talks to me that way.&quot;</p>
<p>The major ignored her. &quot;But right now the main reason is in the room
over there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean? What's in there?&quot; She rose and
tried to open the locked door.</p>
<p>&quot;It's another one of your slaves. Tai-Po threatened to give him a
torturous death if I told you about him, but he's going to do it anyway,&quot;
Ramsey smirked.</p>
<p>Sarika called a guard and when he unlocked the door Ramsey introduced her to
Talbert, who was covered in blood and was barely recognizable to
her. The empress ordered him to be taken to doctor Holis and then
she addressed Ramsey. </p>
<p>&quot;The Elder told me he discovered a spy in our midst. I was alarmed it
was Talbert. Of course he must suffer the consequence of
treason, but his death is to be quick and painless. I don't condone
torture no matter what the crime.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And I can't condone tyranny, no matter how it's packaged.&quot;
The tall woman looked down at the empress while she ran her fingers across the
black collar starkly surrounding her neck. &quot;You're really no different than
Tai-Po, Sarika, &quot; she said ruefully. &quot;I hope you two will be very
happy together.&quot; She returned to her work.</p>
<p>&quot;Happy together? Wait!&quot; The startled empress followed swiftly
behind until she caught her arm and held fast. &quot;Did the doctor tell you
that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tai-Po made sure to tell me that you were going to make him your mate.
You need a 'release valve', and since it sure isn't going to be me, then that
that leaves him. Doesn't it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You believe that's how I think of you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course. Are you going to tell me you don't?&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey received the resounding slap without blinking an eye.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!&quot; Sarika gasped, her eyes moist with unshed tears. &quot;I
can't believe-- you don't know-- you're-- you're--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a slave. Just one of your possessions.&quot; She wondered if the
empress felt pleasure like Tai-Po when he inflicted pain. Surely her tears were
a result of not getting what she thought she wanted. &quot;Now, if you'll excuse
me, I have work to do.&quot;</p>
<p>Sarika fled the room while Ramsey sat and rubbed her jaw. The empress packed
a healthy wallop.</p>
<p>The empress returned to her shuttle with confused emotions and Behira caught
her when she entered the craft. &quot;Child!&quot; Sarika was crying.</p>
<p>The elder drew near. &quot;I knew it wasn't safe. What did she do to you? I
hope you used your bracelet. I'll bind her and….&quot; Sarika put out her hand
to ward him off.</p>
<p>&quot;No Elder. She did nothing but speak the truth. But you have overstepped
your bounds once again. Since when do we hold prisoners at the Garrison?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I told you this morning about Talbert. We still need to discover the
location of the Rebel base.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not by torture. You don't make the law. You withheld information from
me again, after we talked about this very problem yesterday. Your secrecy and
cruelty will stop.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't have permission to speak! From this day on you will not lay a
hand on a slave. And if I ever hear of you touching one of mine, I will strip
you of your title and you will be banished.&quot; How could Ramsey believe he
could be 'happy' with someone like him? &quot;Elder Melborne will take over
here. You're relieved of your duty at the garrison.&quot;</p>
<p>Tai-Po's was ghostly pale. Did she just threaten to make him an outcast?
&quot;Empress Sarika--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My decision is final. You will return with Behira and I to the Palace.
Now.&quot;</p>
<p>What did Ramsey say to her, Tai-Po wondered. Whatever it was, she would
regret it. She was going to wish she had never been born. Clearly it was the
time for drastic measures.</p>


<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>Ramsey wondered why the Elder had not returned to punish her for
telling the empress about Talbert. She called to the guard and asked where the
elder was. &quot;I'm finished with the second disrupter. I need to show it
to him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Elder returned to the palace with the empress, but the captain will
give him a message.&quot; He spoke on the telecom and soon became alarmed.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They never arrived. The captain has issued an alert and is starting to
organize a search party.&quot;</p>
<p>Ramsey bolted from the chair. &quot;Is there a shuttle here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, several. Hey, wait. I can't let you….&quot; He stopped talking
when Ramsey pointed the disrupter directly at his head.</p>
<p>&quot;Shhh,&quot; Ramsey instructed. &quot;Where is the bay entrance?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can't tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can. I'm about to turn your brain into mush, and you've got less
than 60 seconds to tell me everything I want to know.&quot;</p>
<p>The guard swallowed nervously as the tall woman looked at the strange weapon
she trained on him, then at the bracelet her wore on his wrist.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't even think about,&quot; she warned. &quot;I'm quicker than you.
Where's the shuttle bay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The seventh and eight doors up the south corridor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And how many soldiers?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Five or six and a maintenance crew. Maybe more along the way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How are they armed besides bracelets? Lazers? Tazers?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Swords. Like me. We're traditional palace guards,&quot; he said, unable
to keep a touch of pride from his voice.</p>
<p>&quot;Will they be alarmed if you tell them you're taking a craft to join the
search party?</p>
<p>&quot;No, but I never fly them myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell them I'm a pilot, and you've been ordered to take me with
you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They won't like it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll take the chance.&quot;</p>
<p>Minutes later they arrived at the bay door and the guard spoke through the
intercom.</p>
<p>&quot;The last shuttle never arrived at the palace. Captain Johnston has
ordered me to join the search for the empress.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Enter&quot;, came the alert reply.</p>
<p>Ramsey tucked the disrupter into her robe.</p>
<p>&quot;Empress Sarika is missing?&quot; the sentry asked incredulously when
they passed. &quot;What could have happened? There were no Rebels in the
area.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I uh, I don't know,&quot; the guard looked at the sentry strangely
and jerked his head toward the dark woman. Ramsey poked his back with a long
finger in warning.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop her!&quot; he shouted as he turned and aimed the invisible beam
from his bracelet at Ramsey. She grunted in pain, yet managed to knock him cold
with a left hook before falling to the ground. Soldiers converged on her and
with determination she ordered her body to respond. She stood and grabbed onto
the rim of the hatch.</p>
<p>&quot;Surrender, Rebel!&quot; The closest guard pointed his long sword at
Ramsey's heart.</p>
<p>She swung her legs through the hatch. He lunged forward, catching her
with his blade and she still she pulled her upper body into the shuttle, quickly
locking the hatch behind her. Ignoring pain, the major found the pilot's
seat. She scanned the controls and was relieved they were not completely
unfamiliar.</p>
<p>The colossal bay doors were closing. An alarm blared as Ramsey powered up the
shuttle. &quot;Okay little doggie, show me what you can do.&quot; Aiming for the
sky she shouted, &quot;Heeyah!&quot; as if she were riding the Texas range. It
was a rush to be airborne and for the first time since waking up in Dethra, she
felt unrestrained.</p>
<p>The guards watched helplessly while the craft turned on its side and flew
out, clearing the bay doors by mere inches.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow&quot;, the stunned sentry let out the breath he had been holding.
&quot;Rebel or not, that's a pilot&quot;</p>
<p>By the time they were able to reopen the mammoth doors the shuttle that
carried the renegade slave was gone from sight.</p>
