<P>B'Elanna cherished the cold water on her skin after being in the hot sun. But
she knew it wasn't too long until the heat became biting cold. This planet liked
to serve up the best of both worlds. </P>
<P>B'Elanna's thoughts drifted off to the last time she had taken a water
shower. It was with Claire. The two fooled around on a secret island Maquis
Outpost near the Cardassian Border. The planet was small, and held a very small
human/Cardassian population. Amazingly, the Cardassians left the planet alone,
figuring it was best to deny the existence of impure Cardassians. B'Elanna and
Claire found a beautiful waterfall on the side of a majestic cliff. Claire
insisted on taking a small dip in the lake it produced. B'Elanna was reluctant,
but couldn't say no to Claire when she gave her the puppy dog eyes. </P>
<P>"Ah, come on B'Elanna. Just a small dip, I promise." Claire pouted.</P>
<P>"You always promise, then we end up getting into trouble." B'Elanna
whispered.</P>
<P>"What are you afraid of, we're alone out here. I checked today's duty roster,
no one's supposed to be around any time soon." Claire countered.</P>
<P>"How convenient for us. And how exactly did we manage to bump into this
waterfall with a nice little lake out here in the middle of nowhere?" B'Elanna
asked.</P>
<P>"Let's just say we didn't bump into it as much as you were led here." Claire
smiled mischievously while slowly backing into the lake.</P>
<P>"Oh really, and I suppose it's just a coincidence we're the only ones out
here today." B'Elanna followed Claire into the lake.</P>
<P>"Must be luck, or maybe the person in charge thought it would be nice if we
got a little alone time." Claire smiled seductively while slipping out of her
now wet T-shirt.</P>
<P>"Could be, seeing that you're the one in charge of the duty roster." B'Elanna
slipped her T-shirt over her head and advanced upon her lover. Wading through
the water B'Elanna's breathing quickened. The half-Klingon could almost feel
Claire's soft skin against her own.</P>
<P>"I see you decided to play." Claire teased as she dived under the water and
left B'Elanna hungering for more.</P>
<P>"Oh I'm ready to play alright." B'Elanna growled. Diving under the crystal
clear water she tried her best to find her prey.</P>
<P>After 30 seconds of holding her breath, B'Elanna resurfaced hoping to find
Claire above the water.</P>
<P>"Where are you?" B'Elanna shouted urgently. She looked from side to side
hoping to catch a glimpse of her lover. Claire knew she wasn't much of a swimmer
and loved to exploit that. </P>
<P>Thinking she saw something in the distance, B'Elanna squinted her eyes hoping
to catch some blonde hair glinting in the sunshine, or maybe even some skin.
Then a splashing sound from behind B'Elanna nearly knocked her out of her
non-existent boots.</P>
<P>Before she could turn around, Claire cupped both of B'Elanna's eyes with her
hands. "Guess who?" Claire teased.</P>
<P>"I don't know, maybe the person that's going to die in a few seconds."
B'Elanna joked, grabbing Claire's hands and bringing them to her mouth. B'Elanna
savoured the taste of the cool clean water on Claire's hands while licking at
them seductively.</P>
<P>Taking one of Claire's fingers, she slowly licked in from base to tip before
taking it into her mouth. Sucking on it like a precious gift, B'Elanna turned
around to find that Claire had slipped out of her shorts as well. This only made
the hungry half-Klingon hungrier.</P>
<P>Now taking two fingers into her mouth, she began to slowly massage Claire's
left breast. Claire moaned lightly in response. Sliding Claire's fingers out of
her mouth and kissing the tips, B'Elanna moved onto her lover's neck.</P>
<P>B'Elanna urgently kissed Claire's neck up and down until she came to her
mouth, which she claimed passionately. B'Elanna attempted to explore Claire with
her tongue, but Claire wouldn't allow access. It was one of their little games
which B'Elanna enjoyed playing. </P>
<P>The point of the game, B'Elanna had to make Claire moan wildly before she
would grant access to her mouth. Not one for wasting time B'Elanna moved her
mouth to Claire's left breast, the one she was still massaging with her
hand.</P>
<P>Seven watched the half-Klingon slip out of her grey tank top and black pants.
Seven wasn't sure if she was doing the right thing by watching B'Elanna strip
naked, but something inside her couldn't resist this opportunity. It was the
proverbial forbidden fruit, and Seven wanted it.</P>
<P>It amazed Seven when B'Elanna closed her eyes and began massaging her own
breasts slowly, softly moaning. She could only assume B'Elanna was enjoying
herself. This brought back the memory of what happened earlier, when B'Elanna
had accidentally touched her breast. She imagined how much B'Elanna must be
enjoying herself, much as she had when she touched her own breast.</P>
<P>Unable to resist, Seven brought her left hand to her left breast and began
massaging it. The sensation almost overwhelmed her. Seven gasped and could feel
her nipple harden under the soft caress. B'Elanna used both hands to kneed and
massage her breasts. Seven decided to do the same. Seven watched B'Elanna tease
her nipples and drop to her knees shuddering. She realised her bio-suit
prevented her from experiencing the same sensation. So she reached behind her
neck and unzipped it. The wet suit clung to her skin as she pulled it down
across her waist, exposing the most beautiful site in the delta quadrant. </P>
<P>Seven's breasts bounced gently as they slipped out from under the tight suit.
Her hands immediately began caressing them again. This time more urgent and
satisfying. Seven could feel every touch and electrical impulse that shot
through her body. Moaning and breathing heavily, Seven watched B'Elanna bring
her right hand down between her thighs. The half-Klingon was now facing her,
feet spread and knees together. Seven made sure B'Elanna's eyes were closed
before continuing. </P>
<P>The breathtaking site almost drew Seven in, but she fought against it.
Recalling B'Elanna's reaction to Seven holding her at night. The blonde borg
didn't want to take any chances to ruin this perfect moment. B'Elanna slid her
right hand up and down her sex, now dripping with honey, while her left hand
continued to tease her left breast. The slick surface allowed easy entry as
B'Elanna's finger slipped inside. She arched her back in sync with the
penetration. "Ahhhhhhhhh!" B'Elanna's scream echoed off the cave walls. </P>
<P>Hearing this brought Seven to the brink. She quickly tensed and let out her
own scream. "Mmmm, Yesssssssss!" Seven's body shook violently for the first
orgasm of her life. The feeling was much better than anything she had ever read.
Although some of the holo-deck programs Captain Janeway suggested were quite
interesting. Seven only watched, rather than participated. She recalled how
Kathryn had told her that they were a 'secret' collection, and under no
circumstances was she to tell anyone else on the ship about them. Now, Seven
knew why the Captain kept them. The feeling wasn't a want, it was a need. </P>
<P>When the wave of the climax settled down, Seven looked to see if B'Elanna had
heard her cry, but B'Elanna simply continued to pleasure herself. Relieved,
Seven continued to watch. B'Elanna moved two fingers in and out of herself,
while using her thumb to rub her swollen clit. Then B'Elanna's tongue licked the
side of her lips seductively as if to invite Seven over. </P>
<P>This alarmed the half-Borg, thinking she had been discovered. Seven's heart
raced at the prospect of being considered a 'peeping tom.' She had heard the
phrase many times, describing mostly Tom Paris and some of the other male crew
members. Luckily, B'Elanna's eyes were closed and she was completely unaware of
Seven's presence. But Seven didn't want to take any chances. So she took one
last look at the bathing beauty and reluctantly left. Slowly slipping her
bio-suit back on, Seven realised she still needed relief. So the blonde Borg
headed back to the cave entrance, hoping to find another abandoned cave to
finish what she started. </P>
<P>Seven's ears pounded with the sound of B'Elanna's passionate cries. This only
served to quicken Seven's pace, because she was afraid she'd change her mind and
go back. </P>
<P>But two words from B'Elanna's mouth stopped her cold, "Oh, Claire!" The
scream was undeniable, and Seven's heart dropped. </P>
