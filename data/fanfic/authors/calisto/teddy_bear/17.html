<P>B'Elanna's eyes lingered on Seven's lithe motionless form. The Lieutenant
couldn't help but admire the beautiful curves of Seven's body. The bio-suit was
still around Seven's waist, exposing the soft, tender breasts that B'Elanna so
wanted to touch. No, it's wrong, B'Elanna kept telling herself. But her mind
continued imagining how it would feel to touch, mold and kneed those bountiful
breasts right in front of her eyes. </P>
<P>The urge grew, but B'Elanna didn't want to take advantage of the situation.
Instead she noticed Seven's blonde hair still out of it's bun and lying all
strewn about the ground. Sleeping beauty, B'Elanna thought. And all I have to do
is kiss her to wake her up. No, bad B'Elanna, stop thinking like that she
scolded herself. But B'Elanna knew she had already kissed Seven, thinking it was
Claire. Undoing the bun, was part of B'Elanna's hallucination, so it didn't take
much to realize what had really happened. </P>
<P>Accidentally touching Seven's breast, kissing her, accidentally touching her
breast again, and falling face first into Seven's breasts. That was more than
enough for a court marshal. </P>
<P>She could see it now, Seven retelling the story to the rest of the crew,
Janeway throwing her in the brig, Tom trying to break her out, and meanwhile,
the entire crew laughing their asses off at her expense.</P>
<P>"Ahhhh, I'm such a klutz around beautiful women." </P>
<P>B'Elanna pounded her forehead. What am I gonna do? B'Elanna thought. </P>
<P>"Find Parker, leave Seven, find Parker, leave Seven…." B'Elanna reviewed her
choices.</P>
<P>But her eyes settled on Seven's golden hair and she knew the answer. B'Elanna
carefully stepped behind the sleeping beauty and lifted Seven up into a sitting
position. Half-cradling Seven from behind, B'Elanna exhaled deeply at the close
intimate contact. </P>
<P>"Seven?" B'Elanna softly whispered, but only silence followed. </P>
<P>B'Elanna laid a gentle hand on Seven's cheek, and trailed her fingers up and
down the perfectly smooth skin. A small sigh escaped her lips as she admired
Seven's tranquil beauty. Using both hands, B'Elanna drew Seven's loose hair from
around her neck. Slowly drawing the hair together, B'Elanna tried to reform the
bun that Seven wore every day. It was more difficult than she had imagined. The
medium-length silky hair was soft to the touch and just too short for B'Elanna
to tie into a bun. </P>
<P>"How in the world does she tie this bun up?" B'Elanna muttered.</P>
<P>Trial and error failed to accomplish anything. B'Elanna had let Claire do her
hair many times before, but she never listened, she preferred to bask in the
feeling of Claire's hands running through her hair.</P>
<P>Now B'Elanna was stuck running her hands over and over again through Seven's
hair, not that she was complaining. B'Elanna lowered her face into Seven's hair
and breathed in the rosy scent, wondering exactly what kind of perfume Seven
wore. Drawing Seven closer, B'Elanna wrapped her arms protectively around the
unconscious Borg, snuggling her head into Seven's crane-like neck.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Back on Voyager, Sick Bay.</P>
<P>"Captain, I really have to agree with Commander Chakotay," the Doctor
protests.</P>
<P>"Look, I understand the risk, and I'm willing to take it," Janeway
counters.</P>
<P>"With all due respect, I don't believe you fully understand what you're
getting yourself into Captain," Chakotay argues.</P>
<P>"It's my decision and I've made it. Now give me the immune system booster
shot Doctor, and that's an order."</P>
<P>Grabbing Janeway's arm, Chakotay forces the Captain to look straight into his
eyes.</P>
<P>"Listen to me Kathryn. I'm not letting you go down there to get yourself
killed."</P>
<P>Janeway's teary-eyes look deep into Chakotay's adamant stare, and the
Commander's tight grip loosens slightly at the wordless plea.</P>
<P>"I have to go down there, don't you understand?" Janeway says through a
cracking voice.</P>
<P>"I know you want to save her, but we're doing everything we can up here.
Going down there won't help matters. In fact, it might actually make things
worse."</P>
<P>Watching the exchange, the Doctor's holographic heart breaks.</P>
<P>"I have to know if Seven's alive. We have no idea how long she'll last
without regenerating, and if I can… do anything to save her, then I have to
try."</P>
<P>"I disagree Kathryn. The Captain of our ship is worth more than one worthless
drone."</P>
<P>Shocked, Kathryn sees Chakotay's face turn into one of rage. Tightening his
grip once again, the Commander turns to the Doctor.</P>
<P>"Doctor, relieve the Captain at once, based on the fact that she is clearly
mentally unstable."</P>
<P>"Nooooo!" Kathryn screams, fighting, scrapping and attempting to push
Chakotay away. But the Commander refuses to let her go, taking a few shots to
the face.</P>
<P>"I have to agree," the Doctor says in a somber tone. "I believe that this
hypo-spray will help calm her down."</P>
<P>Horrified, the Captain struggles grow more fierce.</P>
<P>"I won't let you do this!"</P>
<P>The Doctor closes in and brings the hypo-spray to Kathryn's neck, "I'm sorry,
but you left me no choice."<BR><BR>With one swift move, the Doctor quickly
administers the sleep-inducing drug into Commander Chakotay's neck.</P>
<P>"Seven is not a worthless drone," the doctor says with a grin.</P>
