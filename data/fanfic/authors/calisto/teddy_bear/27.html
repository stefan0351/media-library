<P>Tuvok secretly walked down the corridor to holo-deck 2, hoping no one would
notice him taking advantage of his holo-deck time. As he prepared to enter
holo-deck 2, the doors remained closed. </P>
<P>"Computer, is holo-deck 2 occupied at the moment?" Tuvok questioned.</P>
<P>"Yes, holo-deck 2 is currently occupied by Seven of Nine."</P>
<P>Tuvok tapped his Comm badge, "Lt. Tuvok to Seven of Nine."</P>
<P>No response.</P>
<P>Tuvok quirked an eyebrow, "Computer, what program is Seven of Nine currently
running?"</P>
<P>"The program that Seven of Nine is currently running is unknown."</P>
<P>"Curious. Computer, how long has Seven of Nine been running this
program?"</P>
<P>"Seven of Nine has been running this program for exactly one hour, fifteen
minutes, and forty-two seconds."</P>
<P>"Has she been allotted any extra holo-deck time since returning to
Voyager?"</P>
<P>"No. Seven of Nine is currently occupying Lt. Tuvok's allotted holo-deck
time."</P>
<P>Tuvok furrowed his brow in curiosity and slight annoyance. Ever since Lt.
Paris re-created his wife to cure his ponn farr problem, Tuvok had been
efficiently using up all of his allotted holo-deck time.</P>
<P>"Computer, open the door to holo-deck 2."</P>
<P>"Access to holo-deck 2 is denied."</P>
<P>Tuvok walked up to the holo-deck panel and attempted to override the
restrictions, but found that Seven had used Borg encryption codes to deny
access. Realising that he wasn't going to get passed the Borg encryption codes,
he contacted the only person that could.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B'Elanna had just finished convincing Tom that they should spend the night in
separate quarters, so as to give her some time to recuperate. Tom had insisted
that she stay the night, but she had insisted even harder that she needed a
sonic shower and some sleep. Of course he offered to help, but she said she
wasn't in the mood. After a long quiet meal, quiet in so far as he talked, and
she listened, B'Elanna wasn't feeling up to the message she was about to
receive.</P>
<P>"Tuvok to Lt. Torres."</P>
<P>B'Elanna tapped her Comm badge and answered, "Lt. Torres here. What's up
Tuvok?"</P>
<P>"What is up, is that Seven of Nine has locked herself inside of holo-deck 2
using Borg encryption codes."</P>
<P>B'Elanna felt her guilt double in that one instant, only now realising how
much she had truly hurt Seven. B'Elanna quickly dropped the stuffed Targ that
Tom gave her; supposedly to be Toby's sister, and immediately headed to
holo-deck 2.</P>
<P>"I'm on my way Tuvok."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Approaching holo-deck 2, B'Elanna noticed Tuvok standing quietly outside the
door. </P>
<P>"So, not even going to try to break the Borg encryption codes are ya
Tuvok?"</P>
<P>"It would not be an efficient use of time."</P>
<P>"But standing here in the corridor waiting for me, is?"</P>
<P>Tuvok furrowed his brow while B'Elanna began work on the panel.</P>
<P>"Don't worry Tuvok, I got this covered. I'll inform you when I'm done."</P>
<P>"Very well."</P>
<P>Tuvok turned and left, not wanting her to wonder about why he was here in the
first place.</P>
<P>As the Vulcan left, B'Elanna took the panel covering off and began the real
work of deciphering the Borg encryption. Her mind raced with the time she had
secretly spent studying Seven's Borg encryption codes. She had recorded every
instance in which Seven had used them and had studied them thoroughly. The
thought of actually breaking one of her codes and seeing the look on Seven's
face had driven her for months. It had become a hobby of her's when the tension
between them was at a maximum, but after they came to an understanding, she had
more or less given up on the codes. </P>
<P>Now she was trying to break Seven's Borg encryption for an entirely different
reason, not to see the look of irritation and anger on Seven's face, but to
simply see her face, period. As B'Elanna hit dead end upon dead end of code, her
mind flashed between what had happened on the planet and what was happening now.
All the time she had spent studying Seven's codes seemed useless, as she grew
more and more frustrated at her inability to crack it. But part of her didn't
want to crack the codes. Part of her wanted to go on, never knowing what had
taken place down on the planet. Never knowing the possibility of loving someone
so much that it killed her inside to lose them. Never loving someone so much, as
much as she loved Claire. Here she was, half-Klingon, and she was afraid of
something so arbitrary, but she knew it wasn't arbitrary, it was love and
sometimes it hurt more than anything else in the world. </P>
<P>As B'Elanna's thoughts went back and forth for some time, she had somehow
gotten through most of the barriers in Seven's codes. It surprisingly came down
to only one word, one four-letter word. Bear.</P>
