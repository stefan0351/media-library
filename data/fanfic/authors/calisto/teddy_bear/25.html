<P>"Seven?" Janeway said groggily while emerging from her unconscious state into
the darkness of pre-dawn and a small campfire.</P>
<P>The Captain's blurry eyes re-focused and could make out a swath of brunette
hair in front of her.</P>
<P>"You don't have brown hair," Janeway stated sleepily.</P>
<P>"Actually, I do, but Seven doesn't. I'm Ensign Parker, Captain."</P>
<P>Parker gently helped Janeway into a sitting position.</P>
<P>"Where's Seven?" </P>
<P>Janeway rubber her eyes and frantically looked around the shadowy garden.</P>
<P>"I don't know," Parker said hesitantly.</P>
<P>"What do you mean, you don't know?"</P>
<P>Janeway grabbed Parker by the shoulders. The desperate look in the Captain's
eyes frightened the young Ensign.</P>
<P>"Umm… Well, I got separated from Lieutenant Torres and Seven of Nine a while
back."</P>
<P>"Separated?"</P>
<P>"Yeah, don't ask me how, I can't remember. All I know is that I was
collecting some fruit one minute and the next, I'm in this garden."</P>
<P>"How's that possible?"</P>
<P>"Believe me, I've asked myself that question many…" Parker trailed off while
eyeing a new flower. "Wow, I haven't seen that one before."</P>
<P>Parker stepped out of Janeway's firm grasp and tried walking to the flower,
but Janeway clamped down on Parker's arm and turned her around.</P>
<P>"What are doing?" Janeway questioned angrily.</P>
<P>"I was just going to examine that flower over there."</P>
<P>Parker pointed.</P>
<P>"I asked you a direct question and I expect an answer."</P>
<P>"I'm sorry Captain, I didn't mean to offend you. It's just that this place
can be very distracting."</P>
<P>"That's okay Ensign, I know what you mean, it's beautiful, but we have more
pressing matters at hand."</P>
<P>"Of course Captain."<BR><BR>"Good. Now have you tried to re-unite with Seven
and B'Elanna?"</P>
<P>"Yes, but that stupid desert got in the way."</P>
<P>"What desert?"</P>
<P>"That's just it Captain, there was a desert surrounding this garden before
you came. When I heard the Delta Flyer crash down and I went to check on it, the
desert had mysteriously vanished and was replaced by an endless wheat field in
all directions."</P>
<P>"A wheat field?"</P>
<P>Janeway pondered the impossibility of a desert transforming into a wheat
field.</P>
<P>"Yup, just like the ones that you told us about."</P>
<P>Janeway's face reddened a bit at the comment. Apparently some people had
compared her to the doctor when it came to speeches and rambling on, and Indiana
was something she talked about often.</P>
<P>"Show me."</P>
<P>Janeway took Parker by the elbow and waited for the ensign to lead her.</P>
<P>"I'll take you back to the Flyer, it's not far from here."</P>
<P>"Good, maybe we can still fly it," Janeway said almost cheerfully.</P>
<P>"I doubt it, but anything's possible."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B'Elanna moaned softly and curled up beside Seven after their eventful
lovemaking in the glow of the morning sun.</P>
<P>"What did they put in those sandwiches?" B'Elanna yawned exhaustedly.</P>
<P>"I don't know, but I believe the sandwich rejuvenated me."</P>
<P>"I'll say," B'Elanna teased.</P>
<P>Seven smiled brightly.</P>
<P>"Remind me to get the recipe from whoever made them."</P>
<P>"I believe the recipe includes a certain seductive half-Klingon."</P>
<P>Seven smoothed the towel along B'Elanna's bare shoulder.</P>
<P>"Oh really, how about a certain not so innocent half-Borg."</P>
<P>"That may be a part of the recipe as well."</P>
<P>B'Elanna and Seven bantered back and forth, enjoying the playful side of
their new found love. </P>
<P>Seven had often wondered why humans talked so much. Now she knew why. The
subtle and not so subtle innuendo was addictive.</P>
<P>The rising sun glinting off of Seven's ocular implant was giving B'Elanna a
headache. Closing her eyes, B'Elanna gathered herself and propped herself up on
an elbow. B'Elanna took her right hand and brushed back a strand of blonde hair
over Seven's ocular implant. Leaving her hand in place, B'Elanna bridged the gap
with a kiss.</P>
<P>"Do you think you've rejuvenated enough to look for a lost Ensign?" B'Elanna
asked while laying small kisses along Seven's cheek.</P>
<P>"I believe so," Seven answered awkwardly, only now remembering there was
someone missing.</P>
<P>"Good."</P>
<P>B'Elanna finished the kissing onslaught with one final kiss on the top of
Seven's head, then she attempted to stand up while maintaining some semblance of
clothing in the chilly morning air. B'Elanna lent a hand to Seven, which was
gladly accepted.</P>
<P>"We should probably get dressed before looking for Parker," B'Elanna said
impishly.</P>
<P>"That would be advisable. I wouldn't want her seeing you naked," Seven said
possessively, while dusting off her bio-suit.</P>
<P>"Is that jealously I hear, Seven. I'm flattered," B'Elanna teased, while
putting on her tank-top.</P>
<P>"I wasn't jealous. I was only stating a social custom."</P>
<P>"Oh, and what custom would that be? Not seeing everyone naked?"</P>
<P>"To be specific, not letting anyone but me see you naked," Seven said in
growing seriousness.</P>
<P>"I don't think you have anything to worry about?"</P>
<P>"What about Lt. Paris?" Seven asked adamantly. </P>
<P>B'Elanna froze. The force with which Seven asked scared the half-Klingon to
her bones.</P>
<P>"I'm sorry Seven. I should have told you before, but I was scared."</P>
<P>B'Elanna tried putting her hand on Seven's shoulder for re-assurance, but
Seven pulled away.</P>
<P>"Scared of what?" Seven questioned, feeling deeply hurt and insecure as her
inner fears finally surfaced.</P>
<P>"I was scared that I still loved Tom. I was scared that you didn't love me. I
was scared that you loved Captain Janeway," B'Elanna pleaded desperately.</P>
<P>Seven was shocked to hear B'Elanna mention Captain Janeway. Although Seven
had often put off her feelings for Captain Janeway as simple admiration, she
knew that wasn't the truth.</P>
<P>"Do you love her, Seven?" B'Elanna pushed.</P>
<P>Seven flinched, her feelings for the Captain still strong, but her feelings
for B'Elanna even stronger. Seven hesitated painfully and was about to speak
when B'Elanna cut her off.</P>
<P>"I can't believe it, the Delta Flyer!" </P>
<P>The shining, brightly polished, Delta Flyer flew high over the distant
horizon and was heading their way, towards a naked Borg, and partly clothed
Klingon.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Captain, long range sensors are detecting two life forms," Parker informed
Janeway from her console.</P>
<P>"Is it them?" Janeway asked hopefully.</P>
<P>"Just a second. I have to recalibrate the sensors, but I believe it's
them."</P>
<P>Janeway put the Flyer on auto-pilot, walked over to Parker and looked over
the shoulder of the young Ensign.</P>
<P>When the readings came in, Janeway grabbed Parker's shoulder and gave it a
tight squeeze, relief washing over her face.</P>
<P>Setting the co-ordinates to memory, Janeway quickly sat down in front of the
main console and re-entered the new co-ordinates. </P>
<P>"We should be within visual range in under three minutes Captain," Parker
reassured unnecessarily.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Hurry." </P>
<P>B'Elanna urgently wanted Seven inside her bio-suit before the Flyer was close
enough for it's occupants to see Seven naked.</P>
<P>"I am dressing as fast as I can," Seven answered scathingly.</P>
<P>"By the time you finish, everyone will know what you look like under that
thing."</P>
<P>"Is that a problem?"</P>
<P>Seven glared at B'Elanna.</P>
<P>"Of course it's a problem. I don't want anyone seeing you naked but me,"
B'Elanna protested, hoping Seven would finish pulling up the rest of the
bio-suit.</P>
<P>"You're too late for that," Seven stated nonchalantly.</P>
<P>"What? Janeway?" B'Elanna blurted in disgust.</P>
<P>"No, the Doctor," Seven answered coolly.</P>
<P>"Oh. Well, that's expected," B'Elanna said, relief showing in her voice.</P>
<P>"Why is that expected?"</P>
<P>"Because he's the Doctor, plus he's a hologram."</P>
<P>"So you don't mind that he helps me dress every day?"</P>
<P>"What? I thought you meant checkups and stuff," B'Elanna shouted.</P>
<P>"I did not."</P>
<P>"Well, we're gonna have to talk about that when we get back to Voyager."</P>
<P>"Why not now."</P>
<P>"Because the Flyer's almost overhead of us and apparently you need help
zipping up," B'Elanna exasperated. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"What are they doing down there?" Janeway shouted, alarmed at the two figures
under 200% zooming in the view screen.</P>
<P>"Uh, I believe Lt. Torres is zipping Seven up," Parker said in
astonishment.</P>
<P>"I know that, but what *were* they doing?" Janeway cried.</P>
<P>Parker, too afraid to answer, just sat quiet at her console and watched Lt.
Torres in a tank-top, zip up their Chief Astrometrics Officer.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The Flyer's doors opened and out popped a raging Captain Janeway.</P>
<P>"What in the hell were you two doing?" </P>
<P>Janeway stared down B'Elanna with interrogating intensity.</P>
<P>"Uh, well, Seven got hurt, Captain," B'Elanna answered, startled at the
Captain's anger.</P>
<P>"Hurt?" Janeway's tone softened, while she walked over to Seven.</P>
<P>"Yeah, she fell while climbing a rocky incline, and I helped her clean the
wound on her shoulder," B'Elanna answered more confidently this time.</P>
<P>"Oh. Is that all?"</P>
<P>"Yes Captain."</P>
<P>B'Elanna avoided Seven's angry gaze. She knew the young Borg didn't like the
fact that she was hiding what happened between them, but she figured that it was
none of the Captain's business. </P>
<P>Janeway gently cupped Seven's elbow and asked which shoulder was injured.
Seven instinctively flinched and pulled back at the sudden contact, but after
realizing who it was, she apologized, saying she was just distracted.</P>
<P>"Strange, this place seems to have a habit of distracting people," Janeway
replied, remembering what had happened earlier with Ensign Parker.</P>
<P>"We should get you back to the Delta Flyer for medical treatment," Janeway
said softly, wrapping a hand around Seven's waist, much to B'Elanna's
distaste.</P>
<P>"Yes Captain," Seven answered faintly, her attention still on B'Elanna.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, you can take command of the Delta Flyer, while I look after
Seven's injury," Janeway ordered while leading Seven back to the ship.</P>
<P>"Yes Captain!" B'Elanna overemphasized, watching the Captain shamelessly
draping herself all over the young Borg.</P>
<P>Parker watched all three women approach and said hello to Seven as she was
led to the small medical room in the Delta Flyer. Parker also watched as Lt.
Torres blew right by her and towards the main console without saying a word,
obviously steamed at something.</P>
<P>Parker closed the Flyer's doors, somewhat hurt at getting the cold shoulder
from Lt. Torres. </P>
<P>Sitting down at her console, Parker couldn't help but speak up.</P>
<P>"Are you okay Lieutenant?" Parker asked cautiously.</P>
<P>"Oh I'm fine, just fine," B'Elanna exclaimed sarcastically.</P>
<P>"Sorry, I was just asking."</P>
<P>B'Elanna felt a pang of guilt for taking out her frustrations on the poor
Ensign who was God knows where for the past couple of days.</P>
<P>"No, I'm sorry Parker. I didn't mean to take it out on you."</P>
<P>B'Elanna turned around to see Parker lift her head.</P>
<P>"It's okay Lieutenant, I'm used to people using me as a punching
bag."<BR><BR>"What, that's awful."</P>
<P>"Not literally, just verbally."</P>
<P>"Still, that's not right. Who uses you as a punching bag?" B'Elanna asked
sincerely, momentarily forgetting her own anger at what was happening in the
medical room.</P>
<P>"Oh, I can't name names," Parker said shyly.</P>
<P>"Hey, whoever it is, deserves what's coming to them. And believe me, if they
think they can treat you like their own personal holo-anger-management program,
then they got another thing coming."</P>
<P>Parker couldn't help but laugh a little under her breath .</P>
<P>"No, it's okay really, you shouldn't get involved."</P>
<P>B'Elanna was familiar with not wanting to be a rat, but some people just
weren't worth protecting.</P>
<P>"Look, how about I make you a deal. If you tell me who's bothering you I'll
pull some strings and have them adjust the duty rosters so you won't have to
deal with this person, or persons."</P>
<P>"You'd do that for me?" Parker asked hopefully.</P>
<P>"Of course, you did find me those apples, remember?"</P>
<P>"Thank you Lieutenant."</P>
<P>Parker jumped out of her seat and ran over to B'Elanna and gave her a big
hug.</P>
<P>B'Elanna awkwardly patted Parker on the back.</P>
<P>"Well, you can thank me by telling me exactly where you've been the past
couple of days and how our little Captain managed to get past the bio-electric
interference in the Delta Flyer."</P>
<P>"Oh you wouldn't believe me if I told you."</P>
<P>"Believe me, I think I would," B'Elanna replied knowingly.</P>
