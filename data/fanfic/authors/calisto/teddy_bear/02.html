<P>Disoriented, Seven climbed awkwardly up the rocky incline. Seven's right hand
shook as she tried to grab onto a small rock. Her balance was completely off and
she miss-stepped. Seven slid a rocky six feet to the cave entrance floor. A
shower of dust and dirt puffed up and partially covered the fallen half-Borg.
</P>
<P>Seven laid in a fetal position, holding her left shoulder, where a sharp rock
had cut deeply into the soft tissue. Instead of getting up, Seven simply stayed
in the fetal position. The emotions that racked her body were completely new.
Most of them were painful and Seven didn't know how to deal with them. </P>
<P></P>
<P>B'Elanna heard a loud crash echo through the cave. Startled, she quickly
grabbed her grey top and pants and put them on, leaving her underwear behind.
Still dripping from the shower, B'Elanna ran through the dark parts of the cave,
occasionally, bumping into the rocky walls. But she didn't care, her instincts
told her that something bad had happened. And Seven was probably hurt. </P>
<P>When B'Elanna rounded the corner, she saw Seven laying on the ground covered
in a thin layer of dust. Blood was dripping from Seven's left shoulder. B'Elanna
immediately bent down and checked if Seven was still conscious. "Are you okay?
What happened?" B'Elanna bombarded the dazed Borg. No answer. </P>
<P></P>
<P>B'Elanna placed her right hand behind Seven's head and held it up. Seven's
eyelid's were closed. B'Elanna tried opening one, but it immediately closed back
once she let it go. "Seven, wake up!" B'Elanna shouted. "You have to wake up!"
B'Elanna panicked. The half-Klingon's heart raced as she tried to think of what
to do. </P>
<P>After several bad ideas, B'Elanna settled on squeezing the excess water from
her hair onto Seven's face. The beautiful blonde immediately turned her face
from the cold water. "Mmmm... what are doing?" Seven mumbled, while shaking her
head. "I was trying to re-vive you." B'Elanna said, placing her arm around
Seven's back. "Here, sit up." B'Elanna motioned. "I do not require assistance."
Seven responded proudly. "The hell you don't." B'Elanna scolded. "You're
half-conscious, half-covered in dust, and bleeding from your left shoulder.
Don't tell me you don't require assistance." B'Elanna continued. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Seven didn't respond, surprised at the emotion the Lieutenant showed. "Here,
try sitting up against the cave wall." B'Elanna soothed, while half-lifting
Seven over to the wall. Seven settled into a comfortable position, knees up
against her chest, while still clasping her left shoulder. "Now, are you going
to tell me what happened, or do I have to interrogate it out of you." B'Elanna
asked, looking deeply into an ocean of blue. Seven looked down, unable to return
the stare. "Are you not already interrogating me." Seven responded like a hurt
child.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"I'm sorry if it seems that way. I just wanted to know what happened so I
could help you." B'Elanna softly ran the back of her hand along Seven's cheek.
The beautiful Borg froze. Seven's mouth betrayed her and she let a small gasp,
eyes closed. B'Elanna quickly pulled her hand back, aware of what she had just
done. "Sorry, I didn't mean to..." B'Elanna blurted out. Seven blushed, and
continued to study the ground with her eyes. </P>
<P>"Um, how about I take a look at that wound." B'Elanna pointed to Seven's
shoulder. Seven removed her right hand to let B'Elanna take a closer look. "Wow,
that looks pretty bad. We should probably wash the wound before it gets
infected." B'Elanna said, concerned. "That would be the logical course of
action." Seven responded, while flinching at B'Elanna's touch. </P>
<P></P>
<P>"Sorry, did that hurt?" B'Elanna asked in a worried tone. "Only slightly."
Seven lied, not wanting to reveal the real reason behind the flinch. "Okay, let
me help you to the waterfall so we can clean that wound." B'Elanna ducked her
head under Seven's left arm and placed her right arm around Seven's back. "Now,
on the count of three, we stand up." B'Elanna said. "One... two... three." The
two stood up in unison. </P>
<P>"Good. Am I hurting your arm like this?" B'Elanna asked about Seven's left
arm draped around B'Elanna's back. "No. It's fine." Seven lied again, wanting to
keep the closeness between them. </P>
<P></P>
<P>"Good, otherwise I'd probably have to carry you like a bride, and I don't
think either of us would want that." B'Elanna joked. Seven's mind was suddenly
captured by that single image. Being carried to safety by the Lieutenant seemed
like a wonderful idea. Even if it did clash with her pride. </P>
<P>Seven's feet had stopped moving since B'Elanna mentioned the bridal joke.
"Hello, you there Seven?" Torres waved her hand in front of Seven's blank eye's.
"Look, I don't mind carrying you there against your will, but if your feet don't
start moving, then you're gonna have to live with that for the rest of your
life." B'Elanna half-threatened, knowing that Seven was the second proudest
person on the ship, next to the Captain. Of course B'Elanna wasn't far behind.
</P>
<P></P>
<P>"I will start moving my feet." Seven stated tentatively, not wanting to seem
inadequate. B'Elanna smiled, and began moving forward with the dazed Borg,
hoping they wouldn't meet any of the sharp rocks B'Elanna had ran into before.
</P>
<P>Turning the corner, B'Elanna could see she had left her bra and panties lying
next to the waterfall. "Oh my g.." B'Elanna cut herself off, while blushing
immensely. "Umm... I..." B'Elanna tried to think of something to say to ease the
embarrassment, but only partial sentences came out. Seven, meanwhile, observed
B'Elanna's underwear with quiet fascination. The blonde had seen something
similar in one of the Captain's holo-programs. From what Seven could tell, the
Lieutenant's panties were a simple white silk style, with matching bra. </P>
<P></P>
<P>B'Elanna's face grew redder when she noticed Seven eyeing her unmentionables.
"Silk?" Seven tried to confirm. "What?" Torres asked, shocked. "Are your
undergarments made of silk?" Seven asked again. B'Elanna's flushed face said it
all. "I... I... don't see what that has to do with anything?" The Lieutenant
managed to get out. "Am I embarrassing you?" Seven asked, almost back to her old
self. "Well, yeah. I don't usually talk to people about my underwear." B'Elanna
joked. </P>
<P>"I did not mean to embarrass. I only inquired about them because I do not
wear underwear" Seven stated. B'Elanna fought hard to keep her eyes from looking
down at the Borg's shapely figure. But her face was level with Seven's ample
bosom, and they were still holding onto each other. "That's nice to know."
B'Elanna laughed nervously. "How about we just sit you down next to the
waterfall, and we can wash that wound, okay?" Torres took a deep breath, hoping
to switch the subject.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Seven gingerly sat down on a flat rock next to the streaming water. B'Elanna
made sure to ask Seven if she was okay before letting go, secretly relishing the
contact. Turning around, B'Elanna quickly ran to pick up her bra and panties,
then squeezed them into a tight ball. Now the lieutenant was stuck with the
problem of where to put them. She cursed Starfleet for not putting pockets on
the standardized pants. </P>
<P>So B'Elanna just held them behind her back when she turned to face the
wounded Borg. The half-Klingon caught Seven's face going from extreme pain, to
one that tried to hide it. Immediately, B'Elanna dropped her underwear in the
water, scolding herself at being so inconsiderate of Seven's welfare. "I'm so
sorry." B'Elanna apologized, running to Seven's side and kneeling down next to
her. "For what?" Seven asked, trying to mask the pain. "For being more worried
about my underwear, than I was about you." B'Elanna said softly.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"I do not require an apology." Seven stated. B'Elanna smiled, "I know you
don't, but I do." The Lieutenant paused and took a deep breath. "Ever since
you've joined our ship I've been a real bitch to you. I've always thought it was
because you were arrogant, but that was just an excuse." Torres bowed her head.
"An excuse for what?" Seven asked. </P>
<P>B'Elanna slowly looked up with tears in her eyes. "It was an excuse...
for..." B'Elanna tried to tell Seven the truth, but it wouldn't come out. So she
lied. "It was an excuse for me just being a bitch" B'Elanna said dejectedly.
"You see, I've never had many girlfriends. I usually see them as competition. So
we end up fighting, rather than talking." Torres wiped the tears from her eyes,
hoping Seven wouldn't see through her. "That is unfortunate." Seven responded,
shaken up by B'Elanna's tears. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Seven wanted so much to comfort B'Elanna, and almost reached out to touch her
cheek. But she didn't trust herself. Seven could tell that B'Elanna was hiding
something very painful, and knew that it was best not to push her on the matter.
So they silently stared into each other's eyes. </P>
<P>B'Elanna began to tear up again, seeing understanding in what she always
thought was arrogance. Seven's heart nearly broke when she saw B'Elanna turn
around, sobbing. So she slipped her arms around B'Elanna's waist and held her
gently from behind. "It's okay B'Elanna. I'm here." Seven whispered softly,
pressing the side of her face against B'Elanna's cheek. </P>

<P>B'Elanna's body filled with a warmth she hadn't felt in a long time. Seven's
embrace felt dreamy. B'Elanna took Seven's hand from around her waist and
brought it to her mouth. Kissing the back of Seven's fully human hand, B'Elanna
remembered what it felt like to be held lovingly. Only this was Seven of Nine,
not Claire. B'Elanna knew that the Borg was only trying to stop her from balling
her eyes out. B'Elanna then realised the inappropriateness of holding Seven's
hand to her mouth and quickly let go. </P>
<P>"Sorry, I was thinking of someone else." B'Elanna apologised., sniffling back
a tear. A knife dug deeply into Seven's heart. The pain shot through her once
again, even worse than when B'Elanna had cried out her lover's name. </P>
<P>"I sometimes get like that you know, daydreaming and all." B'Elanna
continued, hoping Seven wouldn't be upset at the intimate contact. </P>
<P>"Apology accepted." Seven swallowed hard, holding back the hurt and removed
her left arm from around B'Elanna's waist. </P>
<P>"Good." B'Elanna said, standing up and turning to see Seven with her head
down. B'Elanna concluded that the kiss had upset Seven more than she was letting
on. So the Lieutenant decided to change the subject.</P>
<P>"Ooh, stupid me." B'Elanna scolded herself. "We really have to clean that
wound now, or else it's gonna get infected." </P>
<P>"Very well." Seven responded, not lifting her head.</P>
<P>"Okay, how do you want to do this?" B'Elanna asked, not wanting to bring up
the inevitable.</P>
<P>Seven swallowed. "I believe you should remove my bio-suit, so you can better
clean the wound." Seven stated, her voice almost cracking.</P>
<P>B'Elanna blushed intensely, even though she knew it was coming. "Well, not
the whole suit right?" B'Elanna offered.</P>
<P>"You are correct, only the top need be removed." Seven tried to ease the
obviously flustered Lieutenant. </P>
<P>"Great." B'Elanna said sarcastically. </P>
<P>"You can start by unzipping the suit at the base of my neck." Seven
explained, turning around painfully.</P>
<P>"Okay." Was all B'Elanna could say, with her heart racing, body tingling and
knees almost buckling. "So I just unzip it here?" B'Elanna brought her shaking
hand to Seven's neck. </P>
<P>"Yes." Seven said nervously. The Borg was beginning to feel uncomfortable at
the prospect of B'Elanna viewing her nakedness. Although she had never had a
problem with being naked before, the possibility that the Lieutenant would
disapprove of her form disturbed her. </P>
<P>"Okay, here I go. You ready?" B'Elanna asked hesitantly.</P>
<P>"Yes." Seven swallowed and closed her eyes. B'Elanna slowly unzipped the
bio-suit with her right hand, using her left hand to unwrap Seven's soft
shoulders. Carefully, B'Elanna removed the suit around the wound, her hand
accidentally touching Seven's breast as it bounced free. The touch sent shock
waves through Seven's body.</P>
<P>"Sorry." B'Elanna apologised. I can't believe I did that again, B'Elanna said
to herself while pounding her forehead.</P>
<P>"There is no need to apologise Lieutenant." Seven responded, breathing a
little harder. </P>
<P>"Thanks, it's just that I never imagined I'd be living out Harry's fantasy."
B'Elanna joked, hoping to ease the tension.</P>
<P>"You are correct." Seven stated.</P>
<P>"What?" B'Elanna asked, confused.</P>
<P>"Ensign Kim's fantasy does include undressing me or me undressing myself."
Seven responded, knowing B'Elanna would be shocked.</P>
<P>"What?" B'Elanna shouted, eyes wide open.</P>
<P>"When I was upgrading holo-deck 1, I was able to watch several interesting
holo-programs play out." Seven stated nonchalantly.</P>
<P>"You broke into our private holo-programs." B'Elanna shouted. "How could
you?" B'Elanna turned Seven around, holding her by the arms.</P>
<P>"I did not purposely break into anyone's private collection." Seven said
defensively.</P>
<P>"Then what happened?" B'Elanna held Seven's arms even tighter, while looking
straight into her eyes.</P>
<P>"While upgrading the systems, I found someone had already broken into Ensign
Kim's private collection, as well as some other members of the crew." Seven
explained.</P>
<P>"Other members?" B'Elanna asked, eager to know if she was one of them.</P>
<P>"Yes. But I do not think I should disclose any of those other members." Seven
answered.</P>
<P>"Why not? You just told me Harry's fantasy!" B'Elanna complained. </P>
<P>"I was attempting to lighten the mood, just as you were." Seven
responded.</P>
<P>"So lighten it even more, tell me who else got hacked into." B'Elanna pushed,
closing in on Seven's personal space. </P>
<P>"If you are worried that your collection was hacked into, you need not
worry." Seven assured.</P>
<P>"Thank you." B'Elanna breathed a sigh of relief, and lowered her head, right
into Seven's ample bosom. The soft, tender, white flesh took B'Elanna by
surprise. The half-Klingon's face was buried in between Seven's wonderful
breasts, and B'Elanna couldn't move. </P>
<P>Seven was equally frozen at the contact. She could feel B'Elanna's lips
softly pressed against the inside of her breasts, but not kissing them. Seven's
head spun and her knees weakened. B'Elanna noticed Seven losing balance, as the
breasts her face was pressed against fell away from her. Quickly reaching her
arms out, B'Elanna caught Seven and laid her down gently. The Lieutenant walked
over to her Starfleet jacket and picked it up to place it underneath Seven's
head. </P>
<P>Seven's fainting spell had saved them from an extremely awkward moment of
conversation. Although, B'Elanna knew she had some explaining to do when Seven
woke up. But now, the Lieutenant was more worried about the wound on Seven's
shoulder. Cupping her hands together, B'Elanna reached over to the waterfall and
collected some water, then poured it onto Seven's wound, washing away some of
the blood. </P>
<P>After repeatedly washing away blood, B'Elanna looked around for something to
tie off the wound, and saw nothing. Then she remembered that her silk panties
were underneath the water. As embarrassing as it was, B'Elanna forced herself to
swallow her pride. So she reached under the water, picked up her panties and
wringed them out. After carefully tying her underwear around Seven's shoulder,
B'Elanna sat back exhausted, more emotionally than physically. </P>
<P>Closing her eyes, B'Elanna thought of all the events in the past few days
that had led up to this moment. The amazingly civil conversation the two had in
the mess hall. The way Seven held her in the cold of night, keeping her from
freezing to death. The way Parker sucked up to her by getting those alien
apples. And the way that the two had failed in finding Parker. No, the way she
alone had failed. B'Elanna knew that she was in charge, and that she, not Seven
was to blame for Parker's disappearance. </P>
<P>After all, if she had been more civil to Seven during their attempt to
contact Voyager, Parker would have never ran off to the apple patch. Now she had
to choose between staying by Seven's side or going off alone to find their
missing team member.</P>

<P>B'Elanna's eyes lingered on Seven's lithe motionless form. The Lieutenant
couldn't help but admire the beautiful curves of Seven's body. The bio-suit was
still around Seven's waist, exposing the soft, tender breasts that B'Elanna so
wanted to touch. No, it's wrong, B'Elanna kept telling herself. But her mind
continued imagining how it would feel to touch, mold and kneed those bountiful
breasts right in front of her eyes. </P>
<P>The urge grew, but B'Elanna didn't want to take advantage of the situation.
Instead she noticed Seven's blonde hair still out of it's bun and lying all
strewn about the ground. Sleeping beauty, B'Elanna thought. And all I have to do
is kiss her to wake her up. No, bad B'Elanna, stop thinking like that she
scolded herself. But B'Elanna knew she had already kissed Seven, thinking it was
Claire. Undoing the bun, was part of B'Elanna's hallucination, so it didn't take
much to realize what had really happened. </P>
<P>Accidentally touching Seven's breast, kissing her, accidentally touching her
breast again, and falling face first into Seven's breasts. That was more than
enough for a court marshal. </P>
<P>She could see it now, Seven retelling the story to the rest of the crew,
Janeway throwing her in the brig, Tom trying to break her out, and meanwhile,
the entire crew laughing their asses off at her expense.</P>
<P>"Ahhhh, I'm such a klutz around beautiful women." </P>
<P>B'Elanna pounded her forehead. What am I gonna do? B'Elanna thought. </P>
<P>"Find Parker, leave Seven, find Parker, leave Seven…." B'Elanna reviewed her
choices.</P>
<P>But her eyes settled on Seven's golden hair and she knew the answer. B'Elanna
carefully stepped behind the sleeping beauty and lifted Seven up into a sitting
position. Half-cradling Seven from behind, B'Elanna exhaled deeply at the close
intimate contact. </P>
<P>"Seven?" B'Elanna softly whispered, but only silence followed. </P>
<P>B'Elanna laid a gentle hand on Seven's cheek, and trailed her fingers up and
down the perfectly smooth skin. A small sigh escaped her lips as she admired
Seven's tranquil beauty. Using both hands, B'Elanna drew Seven's loose hair from
around her neck. Slowly drawing the hair together, B'Elanna tried to reform the
bun that Seven wore every day. It was more difficult than she had imagined. The
medium-length silky hair was soft to the touch and just too short for B'Elanna
to tie into a bun. </P>
<P>"How in the world does she tie this bun up?" B'Elanna muttered.</P>
<P>Trial and error failed to accomplish anything. B'Elanna had let Claire do her
hair many times before, but she never listened, she preferred to bask in the
feeling of Claire's hands running through her hair.</P>
<P>Now B'Elanna was stuck running her hands over and over again through Seven's
hair, not that she was complaining. B'Elanna lowered her face into Seven's hair
and breathed in the rosy scent, wondering exactly what kind of perfume Seven
wore. Drawing Seven closer, B'Elanna wrapped her arms protectively around the
unconscious Borg, snuggling her head into Seven's crane-like neck.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Back on Voyager, Sick Bay.</P>
<P>"Captain, I really have to agree with Commander Chakotay," the Doctor
protests.</P>
<P>"Look, I understand the risk, and I'm willing to take it," Janeway
counters.</P>
<P>"With all due respect, I don't believe you fully understand what you're
getting yourself into Captain," Chakotay argues.</P>
<P>"It's my decision and I've made it. Now give me the immune system booster
shot Doctor, and that's an order."</P>
<P>Grabbing Janeway's arm, Chakotay forces the Captain to look straight into his
eyes.</P>
<P>"Listen to me Kathryn. I'm not letting you go down there to get yourself
killed."</P>
<P>Janeway's teary-eyes look deep into Chakotay's adamant stare, and the
Commander's tight grip loosens slightly at the wordless plea.</P>
<P>"I have to go down there, don't you understand?" Janeway says through a
cracking voice.</P>
<P>"I know you want to save her, but we're doing everything we can up here.
Going down there won't help matters. In fact, it might actually make things
worse."</P>
<P>Watching the exchange, the Doctor's holographic heart breaks.</P>
<P>"I have to know if Seven's alive. We have no idea how long she'll last
without regenerating, and if I can… do anything to save her, then I have to
try."</P>
<P>"I disagree Kathryn. The Captain of our ship is worth more than one worthless
drone."</P>
<P>Shocked, Kathryn sees Chakotay's face turn into one of rage. Tightening his
grip once again, the Commander turns to the Doctor.</P>
<P>"Doctor, relieve the Captain at once, based on the fact that she is clearly
mentally unstable."</P>
<P>"Nooooo!" Kathryn screams, fighting, scrapping and attempting to push
Chakotay away. But the Commander refuses to let her go, taking a few shots to
the face.</P>
<P>"I have to agree," the Doctor says in a somber tone. "I believe that this
hypo-spray will help calm her down."</P>
<P>Horrified, the Captain struggles grow more fierce.</P>
<P>"I won't let you do this!"</P>
<P>The Doctor closes in and brings the hypo-spray to Kathryn's neck, "I'm sorry,
but you left me no choice."<BR><BR>With one swift move, the Doctor quickly
administers the sleep-inducing drug into Commander Chakotay's neck.</P>
<P>"Seven is not a worthless drone," the doctor says with a grin.</P>

<P>"Mmmmm." </P>
<P>"Seven?" B'Elanna said with a start, while taking her face out of the Borg's
neck.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna?" Seven whispered, bleary-eyed.</P>
<P>"Yeah, it's me. Glad you could make it back to the conscious world."</P>
<P>B'Elanna softly brushed the hair away from Seven's eyes. The tender action
froze Seven for a brief second.</P>
<P>"I…am glad as well," Seven said nervously.</P>
<P>"Good, then we're both glad." </P>
<P>B'Elanna lightly stroked Seven's hair, once again drawing it back behind the
Borg's head. Seven could feel every stroke, every caress, and every tingle
caused by B'Elanna's gentle ministrations. </P>
<P>"I believe the intensified bio-electric field caused my Borg implants to
malfunction."</P>
<P>"And that's why you blacked out, right?" B'Elanna jumped at the
opportunity.</P>
<P>"Precisely," Seven said, extremely relieved.</P>
<P>Heartbeat beginning to slow down again, B'Elanna took a deep breath, and
decided to move the conversation into a more comfortable direction.</P>
<P>"You know, while you were out, I tried to tie your hair back into a bun."</P>
<P>"You did not succeed."</P>
<P>"Is it that obvious?" B'Elanna continued the soft strokes. "How in the world
do you get your hair into a bun anyway?" </P>
<P>Seven exhaled deeply and closed her eyes, distracted by the constant contact
of B'Elanna's wandering hands on her hair.</P>
<P>"I require a bobby pin," Seven managed to get out.</P>
<P>"A what?" </P>
<P>"A bobby pin. It is designed to hold my hair in a bun shape. A highly
efficient tool."</P>
<P>"No wonder I couldn't tie your hair together."</P>
<P>B'Elanna began to playfully flip and twirl Seven's hair.</P>
<P>"Where'd they even get the name bobby pin in the first place?"</P>
<P>"It has been my observation that humans tend to name inventions after
themselves, perhaps the person that created it was named Bobby."</P>
<P>"True, but it's still weird."</P>
<P>"If you prefer, you can simply refer to it as a hair pin."</P>
<P>"Now why didn't you just say that in the first place?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna threw up her hands, taking Seven's hair along for the ride.</P>
<P>"I was attempting to start some small talk."</P>
<P>"Oh," B'Elanna said, surprised that Seven would even waste her time starting
a useless conversation. </P>
<P>"You do not wish to small talk?" Seven asked, misreading B'Elanna's surprised
response.</P>
<P>"No, it's not that. It's just that I'm a little shocked that you would even
bother making irrelevant conversation."</P>
<P>B'Elanna began playing with Seven's hair again, taking it between two fingers
and sliding it through to the end. </P>
<P>"The Doctor has taught me that not all small talk is irrelevant."</P>
<P>"Really, and what kind would that be," B'Elanna teased, pulling lightly on
Seven's hair.</P>
<P>Seven hesitated, a little embarrassed about the answer she was going to
give.</P>
<P>"Relevant small talk involves the purpose of building a friendship," Seven
stated, hoping B'Elanna wouldn't read anything into it.</P>
<P>"So are you saying that you want to be my friend?"</P>
<P>Seven anticipated the question, but still found it hard to answer.</P>
<P>"In a manner of speaking," Seven tried to sound nonchalant. </P>
<P>"And what manner would that be? Yes or No?" B'Elanna pushed the obviously
flustered Borg.</P>
<P>"I believe yes."</P>
<P>"You believe, yes? Why don't you know?" B'Elanna continued on the
offensive.</P>
<P>"It has been my observation that you display an unusual hostility towards me
in particular," Seven stated, expecting another classic blow up.</P>
<P>"Oh." B'Elanna stopped her hair stroking, hurt at the accusation. "I… don't
know what to say, except that you're probably right?" B'Elanna felt a hollow
emptiness insider her chest. All these years she vented her anger towards Seven,
thinking that an automaton couldn't feel anything.</P>
<P>"I did not intend to hurt your feelings, Lieutenant." Seven tried to take
away the pain evident in B'Elanna's voice.</P>
<P>"No, that's okay. You're right, I've been such bitch to you ever since you
came aboard," B'Elanna laughed unconvincingly, placing a hand on Seven's good
shoulder.</P>
<P>"I was never offended," Seven reassured, gently placing her hand over
B'Elanna's. </P>
<P>"Thanks." B'Elanna's emptiness was filled with a warmth she had not know
since the alpha quadrant.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Back on Voyager, Shuttle Bay One.</P>
<P>"How are the upgrades going, Tom?" Janeway asked, while casually strolling
into the shuttle bay, supply bag in hand.</P>
<P><BR>"Good, I just remodulated the shielding to protect against that
bio-electric field," Tom said happily, while sliding out from under the Delta
Flyer.</P>
<P>"That's good news, because I'm taking her out now," Janeway hefted the bag
into the ship.</P>
<P>"What?" Tom jumped to his feet.</P>
<P>"You heard me," Janeway said sternly. "You've been reassigned to stay on
Voyager, and pilot this ship home if anything happens to me down there."</P>
<P>"Since when?"</P>
<P>"Since now."</P>
<P>"Look, with all due respect Captain, I'm the best pilot on this ship, and
you're going to need me to get through that bio-electric turbulence."</P>
<P>"That's exactly why you're staying on Voyager. We've already got our
Astrometrics Officer, Chief Engineer, and Hydroponics Bay expert down there, we
don't need to lose our best pilot."<BR><BR>"Let me get this straight, you're
saying a pilot is worth more than the captain."<BR><BR>"Exactly," Janeway fixed
Tom with an aggravated look.</P>
<P>"Okay, I'm not even going to try to understand that logic, but my
girlfriend's down there, and I think I should be the one risking my life for
her. You know, the whole knight in shining armor thing, I'm told girls really
love that."</P>
<P>"Well, this time you're going to have to put your childish fantasy aside and
stay on this ship, understood, Lieutenant?" Janeway was one step away from
ordering Tom to get the hell out of the shuttle bay.</P>
<P>"Understood," Tom answered with his usual angry sarcasm when he didn't get
his way. "But I'm counting on you to bring back my fiancée in one piece," Tom's
anger slipped away, and gave the captain a knowing look.</P>
<P>"Fiancée, huh? I'll be sure to keep that quiet." Janeway smiled while
performing a zipping motion across her mouth.</P>

<P>A cold breeze entered the cavern and gave both B'Elanna and Seven goose
bumps.</P>
<P>"Wooo, it's starting to get chilly. Maybe we should clean your wound one last
time before we freeze to death." </P>
<P>B'Elanna rubbed Seven's arms up and down, careful to avoid the silky
makeshift Band-Aid. </P>
<P>"A prudent suggestion," Seven answered, half-shaking from the cold.</P>
<P>B'Elanna slowly removed her panties wrapped around Seven's shoulder, making
sure the bleeding had slowed down before removing it completely. </P>
<P>"Let me just clean this here, and then we can wipe away the blood."</P>
<P>B'Elanna brought her underwear to the waterfall and began rinsing and
wringing it. Seven sat still watching the water spray up in a soft mist,
covering B'Elanna's shaking form.</P>
<P>"What?" </P>
<P>B'Elanna noticed Seven's unwavering eyes.</P>
<P>"I … was…" Seven babbled, caught off guard at the question.</P>
<P>"Was what? Watching me freeze here while you sit in the warm area away from
the cold water." </P>
<P>"Precisely." </P>
<P>Seven smiled as much as she could given her Borg nature.</P>
<P>"We'll see about that." </P>
<P>B'Elanna cupped the water-soaked panties in her hands, making sure not to
wring it, and carried it over to a now nervous Seven. B'Elanna's eyes gleamed
with mischief as she stepped closer to the sitting Borg.</P>
<P>"I believe you have malevolent intentions."</P>
<P>"What makes you say that?" </P>
<P>B'Elanna stopped abruptly, holding her weapon just in front of Seven's
face.</P>
<P>"You did not adequately remove the water from your undergarment," Seven
swallowed.</P>
<P>"Oh did I forget to do that?" B'Elanna asked innocently. "Let me fix that
right now." </P>
<P>B'Elanna brought the soaked panties to the side of Seven's face, just above
the wounded left shoulder and began to squeeze the water out, splashing the
Blonde Borg in the face as well.</P>
<P>Seven turned her head and closed her eyes, avoiding the cold water.</P>
<P>"I do not believe you are attempting to clean the wound."</P>
<P>"What do you mean? The water's washing away the blood isn't it?"</P>
<P>"Yes, but the majority of it is ending up on my face, a highly inefficient
use of resources." </P>
<P>Seven gave the smiling Lieutenant an amusingly annoyed look.</P>
<P>"We've got an unlimited supply of water, I'd hardly call it inefficient."</P>
<P>"Your assumption is flawed. The water that flows into this cavern cannot
possibly be unlimited," Seven retorted, grabbing B'Elanna's panties with her
right hand.</P>
<P>"Hey, those are my unmentionables if you don't mind." </P>
<P>B'Elanna reached for her panties, but Seven had them tightly closed inside
her fist.</P>
<P>"I do not see why you require such unnecessary clothing," Seven stated, while
B'Elanna continued her futile efforts at opening the Borg's amazingly strong
human hand.</P>
<P>"I'd hardly call it unnecessary Seven," B'Elanna breathed out in frustration,
finally giving up on the her panties.</P>
<P>"Your attempts at retrieving your underwear are futile."</P>
<P>B'Elanna put her hands on her hips and tilted her neck, still somewhat in awe
at the topless Borg in front of her, but not enough to phase her new found
energy. </P>
<P>"So what are you going to do? Keep them for your private collection?" </P>
<P>Seven's heart stopped at the accusation, unsure if the Lieutenant was teasing
her or was actually serious. Noting the playful smile and body language, Seven's
worries were quickly dismissed.</P>
<P>"Yes, as a matter of fact, I was planning on exhibiting them in my private
museum."</P>
<P>"Oh, and what exhibit would they be next to?"</P>
<P>"I have not decided yet, however, I will place them in the new redundant
clothing collection." </P>
<P>"Redundant huh. If it wasn't for my unmentionables you wouldn't have such a
nice arm bandage, now would you?" B'Elanna teased.</P>
<P>"True, but I still do not see the purpose of wearing these on board Voyager."
</P>
<P>Seven opened up her fist, dangling the freshly ruffled panties an arms length
away from the Lieutenant.</P>
<P>"Purpose, what purpose do you need other than making you feel not naked."
</P>
<P>B'Elanna reached for the prize, but it was quickly pulled back beyond the
half-Klingon's reach. The stubborn woman that she was, B'Elanna continued
reaching; losing her balance. Seven's arms instinctively came up and caught the
flustered, yet fiery Lieutenant, still attempting to retrieve her panties. Chest
to chest, face to face, breath to breath, the two searched each other's soulful
eyes, B'Elanna looking deep into an innocent sea of tropical blue, Seven looking
deep into a pained history of chestnut brown. Understanding, desire, and need,
discovered for the first time by someone who never knew love, and found a second
time by someone who'd lost love.</P>
<P>B'Elanna's hands slowly worked their way up behind Seven's naked back and
pulled her in closer. Dropping the now forgotten undergarment, Seven's human
hand reached behind B'Elanna's head and drew in the waiting Lieutenant. No more
hesitation, no more embarrassment, and no more lies, the two captured each
other's hungry mouths. B'Elanna's tongue urgently explored the hidden treasure
of Seven's untouched mouth, while Seven reciprocated with anxious hands,
caressing the Lieutenant through her wet gray tank top.</P>
<P>Moaning, cooing and the suction sounds of passion filled the air. B'Elanna's
naturally aggressive nature took over, and she began kissing and licking the
newly found Borg's neck, down to her right shoulder. </P>
<P>Arching her neck back, Seven exposed what B'Elanna had desired for so long,
and thought she could never have. B'Elanna's hands molded the mountainous mounds
of flesh, teasing the pink peaks with soft, light touches, forcing Seven to
close her eyes.</P>
<P>A kiss on the chin, brought Seven's eyes back open, and she saw a pleading,
questioning B'Elanna asking for one thing. Along with a slight nod, Seven's
tear-stained eyes gave the answer. B'Elanna brought her lips to Seven's, saying
thank you, and then began their descent to the glowing globes that could drop
men and cause failures in Engineering.</P>
<P>Gently licking both of Seven's nipples, brought them up from hiding. B'Elanna
feasted, her watery mouth leaving trails across Seven's breasts. After
unconsciously bringing her hand up to Seven's wounded shoulder and causing a
slight whimper of pain, B'Elanna stopped, worried she had seriously hurt the
woman she now knew she loved.</P>
<P>A soft hand on the shoulder, reassured B'Elanna that Seven was okay.
Realizing Seven's attempts at standing up, B'Elanna helpfully wrapped her arms
around the stumbling Borg and lifted her up. </P>
<P>"What is it?" B'Elanna asked curiously.</P>
<P>Seven's eyes focused on the waterfall, the one that she had secretly watched
B'Elanna bathe under. </P>
<P>"You want to go there do you?" </P>
<P>B'Elanna smiled, watching the young woman happily nod her head in agreement.
One arm wrapped behind Seven's back, B'Elanna helped the beautiful blonde to the
waiting falls.</P>
<P>The cold mist peppered their skin, making both woman shiver in anticipation
of the freezing water. B'Elanna took Seven's human hand and brought it to the
falling water, causing both to open their mouths and gasp at the cold.</P>
<P>Not wanting to let either of them change their mind, Seven swiftly grabbed
the Lieutenant and brought her into the ice-cold water. B'Elanna's shocked
response was quickly muffled by Seven's mouth, exploring urgently, like B'Elanna
had done before. Shaking ferociously, the two lovers clasped onto each other for
warmth. A feeling of icy-cold fear brought them together, for the sake of
survival and for the sake of love. </P>
<P>Seven's desire grew into a flood, tearing at the top of B'Elanna's tank top,
but the Lieutenant's hands stopped her, guiding Seven's hands to the bottom of
her shirt and letting her pull it over her head, allowing the gushing water to
wash all over B'Elanna's body. </P>
<P>Not to be outdone, B'Elanna reached down and pulled the tightest cat-suit
know to man off of the freezing Borg, exposing the honey-laden treasure. Falling
to her knees, B'Elanna brought her mouth to Seven's swollen lips, licking the
lips up and down, finally reaching the love button. Knowing that it was Seven's
first time, B'Elanna wanted to make it special, and last as long as possible.
Taking two fingers, B'Elanna spread Seven's labia apart, and licked each side
before working on the pink slit. Seven's gyrations, encouraged B'Elanna to work
a little faster, slathering her tongue inside of Seven, tasting the tangy juices
of her Borg Queen. </P>
<P>Not wanting to waste a drop of Seven's nectar, B'Elanna greedily licked up as
much as possible, before attempting to bring the young woman to a final climax.
Sensing Seven couldn't last much longer, B'Elanna entered a water-slick finger
inside the moaning woman, and began licking and sucking on Seven's clitoris,
determined to make Seven's first time, the most memorable. Sliding her finger
inside the honeyed walls of Seven's slit, B'Elanna penetrated her with one final
deep thrust, forcing Seven to cry out, collapsing on top of B'Elanna.</P>
<P>Gently taking her finger out of the still climaxing Borg, B'Elanna
seductively licked it from base to tip, finally wrapping her mouth around it,
drinking the remaining love juice. Holding the shaking form in her arms,
B'Elanna softly kissed her lover, comforting her, letting her feel her
presence.</P>
<P>Still shaking, from both the cold water splashing down upon them, and from
the most exhilarating experience of her life, Seven reached for B'Elanna's
pants, wanting to give her the same pleasure that she had so delightfully
received. </P>
<P>B'Elanna happily obliged, allowing Seven to slip the water-soaked Starfleet
pants from her legs. Seven admired B'Elanna's smooth body, caressing, kissing
and licking almost every inch. She wanted so much for B'Elanna to feel the way
she felt, so she started the same way, molding, kissing, and teasing the tan
breasts before she decided to taste B'Elanna's inner sanctum. </P>
<P>Sated by B'Elanna's breasts, Seven kissed the Lieutenant's chin, and asked a
slightly different question than B'Elanna had asked her before, with pleading
eyes. </P>
<P>Upon receiving the answer, Seven passionately kissed her lover, and began her
journey down to the nectar-rich sanctum. Remembering every detail, Seven
performed perfectly the exact same pleasures B'Elanna had bestowed upon her.
Bringing her mouth to B'Elanna's swollen lips and sliding her tongue up and
down, reaching the clitoris with one long lick, Seven tasted the flowing juices
of an impassioned B'Elanna. Spreading her slit apart, Seven licked each side
before tasting the inner depths of heaven. </P>
<P>B'Elanna's cries echoed throughout the cavern walls, while Seven relentlessly
slid her tongue along B'Elanna's slit, lustily licking up every drop of honey
that came gushing out. Realizing that B'Elanna was not long from climax, Seven
easily slipped her finger inside the slick walls of B'Elanna's sanctum, sliding
in and out, sucking on her clit, and one final penetration, brought B'Elanna to
a screaming orgasm.</P>
<P>Riding the waves of climax, B'Elanna captured Seven's mouth, thanking her
lovingly. Gently sliding her finger out from B'Elanna's slit, Seven brought it
to her mouth and licked it up and down seductively, forcing a smile from the
hungry Lieutenant.</P>

<P>"Janeway to Voyager, I've entered the atmosphere. Bio-electric turbulence is
within reasonable levels." </P>
<P>Janeway checked the readouts from the sensors; all systems seemed to be
functioning normally. Although Tom had remodulated the shielding on the Delta
Flyer, the ride was still bumpier than she had imagined. </P>
<P>The unstable temporal distortion had constantly changed in an erratic manner,
making the time on the planet run faster than normal, or in some cases even
slower. The number of changes made it difficult to calculate just how much time
had went by on the planet, combined with the ever-increasing bio-electric field,
the crew of Voyager had no idea how their Chief Engineer, Astrometrics Officer,
and beloved Hydroponics Bay Ensign were coping.</P>
<P>The familiar static voice foreshadowed a communications loss. Janeway was
hoping she could keep in contact with Voyager long enough to send them the
co-ordinates of their missing crew members, but the Delta Flyer's sensors seemed
to be having just as much trouble penetrating the bio-electric field. </P>
<P>Putting the Delta Flyer on auto-pilot, Janeway focused on remodulating the
sensors. Although Harry had done a good job on them already, Janeway was
determined on increasing the range of the sensors. The constant bumping of the
ship didn't distract the Captain at all. Her mind set, Janeway tried everything
she knew to break through the bio-electric field.</P>
<P>After a few minutes of focused work, the bumping suddenly stopped, which in
turn stopped the Captain. The readings showed that the bio-electric field was
most concentrated at the outer atmosphere, thereby making entry the bumpiest
ride of all. Renewed hopes of being able to locate Seven drove the Captain on.
Re-routing power from weapons, shields, and finally life-support, the Captain
managed to get one faint life-sign. Unable to determine which one of the three
crewmembers it was, Janeway crossed her fingers. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Still glowing from the passionate, watery lovemaking, Seven held a freezing
B'Elanna in her arms, sitting on B'Elanna's Starfleet jacket. Only slightly
removed from the waterfall, the two snuggled close for warmth. Wet skin slid
along still more wet skin, as they tried to find a comfortable position.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven whispered softly into B'Elanna's ear.</P>
<P>B'Elanna's head perked up from Seven's warm bosom, her eyes seeking the
depths of Seven's soul.</P>
<P>"I should be the one saying thank you." </P>
<P>B'Elanna smiled, softly bringing her hand to Seven's chin and drawing her in
for a kiss. Sweet, soft, and gentle, the kiss lasted longer than intended.
Seven's arms protectively closed around B'Elanna's body, pulling her closer.
</P>
<P>Normally, Seven would have argued the point, but she didn't feel the need to,
especially with B'Elanna's lips on her own.</P>
<P>Fighting the urge to continue, B'Elanna reluctantly pulled away, but smiled
reassurance.</P>
<P>"I think we should try to get dry before nightfall," B'Elanna almost
giggled.</P>
<P>"That will be a difficult task, considering," Seven said with a mischievous
grin.</P>
<P>"Considering what?" B'Elanna said in a mockingly shocked tone.</P>
<P>Seven quickly closed her mouth around B'Elanna's open one, and lightly
caressed B'Elanna's tongue with her own. Pulling away teasingly, Seven took
B'Elanna's hand in her human one and interlocked their fingers.</P>
<P>"Considering that I will not let you go."</P>
<P>B'Elanna raised her eyebrow at the response, then brought their hands up to
her mouth and closed her lips around Seven's hand, kissing her way up her
lover's arm, careful to avoid the Borg implant. </P>
<P>"So you think you can contain a Klingon huh?" B'Elanna murmured, her lips
closing on Seven's silken shoulder.</P>
<P>"I do not think. I know."</P>
<P>Seven lowered her head to her shoulder, brushing her lips against B'Elanna's
waiting mouth. The Lieutenant gave Seven one quick final kiss before
unexpectedly jumping up and out of the Borg's arms. B'Elanna playfully grabbed
her pants and gray tank-top lying in the watery pool.</P>
<P>"What?" B'Elanna asked teasingly, while twirling her soaked shirt. "You
didn't think I was going to let a challenge go unchallenged did you?"</P>
<P>Raising an eyebrow at B'Elanna, Seven's eyes glided along B'Elanna's smooth
skin, starting at the hand twirling the wet shirt, all the way to B'Elanna's
glistening breasts, which brought a smile to the Borg's lips.</P>
<P>"Naughty girl, Seven." </P>
<P>B'Elanna half-covered her breasts with her shirt and her nether-regions with
her pants.</P>
<P>"If you want full access to my systems, you'll have to catch me first."</P>
<P>B'Elanna licked her lips seductively, and made a full 180, effectively
bearing her butt to Seven, then slowly walked towards the cave entrance, swaying
her hips, and disappearing around the corner.</P>
<P>Seven swallowed hard, her mouth watery from B'Elanna's suggestive display. On
shaky legs, Seven pulled herself up and gathered her wet bio-suit, along with
B'Elanna's unmentionables. Wringing then tying B'Elanna's panties to her
no-longer bleeding shoulder, Seven took the time to bask in the silky-smoothness
of B'Elanna's bra, the scent only increasing her desire.</P>
<P>Deciding that it would take too much time to get dressed, in wet clothing no
less, Seven headed towards the entrance in search of her lover.</P>
<P>Outside the cave, in the breezy air, the sun was still shining brightly, more
than making up for the cool wind that entered the cave. </P>
<P>"Hmmm. Guess it's not close to nightfall after all," B'Elanna murmured to
herself.</P>
<P>B'Elanna turned around to see if Seven was coming, but all she saw was the
darkness of the cave, and something shining from the corner of her eye. It
turned out to be a cracked open rock, but not just any rock, it was tergralium,
a new element Voyager had discovered only a few weeks ago. </P>
<P>It had a knack of masking life-signs, something the Captain thought would be
useful in masking the life-signs of Voyager's crew in case of an emergency. Only
now, It was a problem, because the whole cave seemed to be made of the stuff. If
Voyager had somehow been able to scan for life-signs sometime within the last
few hours, then they would have completely missed the two of them.</P>
<P>B'Elanna's mind worked over the worst possible scenario, in which the crew
only had one chance to scan for life-signs, and that chance had already passed.
But the Engineer inside her head told her that it was useless worrying over
possible scenarios, and all that really mattered was that at least she was
outside the cave, ready to be scanned.</P>

<P>Tom fingered the small velvet box in his hand, going over the many different
ways he could ask B'Elanna to marry him while sitting in the mess hall. Harry's
shift was about to end and Tom knew he'd be dropping by looking for him. Neelix
had already pestered him about what was inside the box. Not knowing human
marriage customs too well, Neelix thought it was just another gift for B'Elanna
when she got back. Harry on the other hand, would know right away.</P>
<P>Going over another proposal just under his breath, he was cut off by a big
slap on the back, and a yellow uniform sitting down across the table.</P>
<P>"So what's in the box?" Harry asked knowingly.</P>
<P>"Just some earrings for my favorite Klingon."</P>
<P>Tom smiled, handing Harry the box.</P>
<P>Harry quickly opened the box and saw a magnificent diamond, perfectly cut,
attached to the classic gold ring. Neelix who had his eyes on the box from
behind the counter the entire time, quickly rushed over, finally realizing the
magnitude of the box and the ring inside.</P>
<P>"I knew you were cheap Tom, but a diamond?" Harry joked.</P>
<P>"What can I say, I'm a traditionalist."</P>
<P>Neelix eagerly stood beside Harry, fidgeting almost out of control in
excitement, reaching out a hand to touch the box, and quickly retracting it, not
wanting damage the ring inside.</P>
<P>Tom laughed at the site of Neelix looking as if he'd been burnt by an open
flame.</P>
<P>"Go ahead Neelix, you can touch it."</P>
<P>That was all Neelix needed to pounce on the box and rip it out of Harry's
hands. </P>
<P>"Hey watch it there Neelix. Tom said you could touch it, not break it."</P>
<P>Harry rubbed the slight burn on his hand.</P>
<P>"This is beautiful," Neelix said in awe, looking at the perfect reflection of
light coming from the diamond. "When are you going to ask her?"</P>
<P>"As soon as she gets back," Tom said without hesitation.</P>
<P>"That's wonderful," Neelix cut off Harry. "Do you mind if I?" </P>
<P>Neelix turned his body slightly towards the rest of the crew in the mess
hall, the ring softly nestled in his cupped hands.</P>
<P>"Well actually, I think there's someone else that deserves that
opportunity."</P>
<P>Tom's eyes went from Neelix to Harry.</P>
<P>"Oh of course, how selfish of me."</P>
<P>Neelix handed the ring to Harry, who stood up gratefully, ring in hand.
Neelix grabbed Tom's glass and spoon and began tapping it excitedly.</P>
<P>"Attention everyone, attention everyone, Mr. Kim has an announcement to
make." </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B'Elanna dropped the tergralium-laden rock from her hand when she felt
Seven's arms wrap around her body from behind and the young Borg's lips along
her neck. Seven tugged on B'Elanna's tank top with bra in hand, hoping the
half-Klingon would get the message. </P>
<P>"Seven," B'Elanna said gaspingly, unable to breathe properly with Seven's
gentle kisses on her neck and cheek. </P>
<P>"I caught you," Seven responded, still reveling in B'Elanna's presence.</P>
<P>"And now you want full access to my systems I suppose."</P>
<P>B'Elanna turned around, seeing the full beauty of her lover, as the water
glistened off of Seven's nude body, in the spectacular sunshine. </P>
<P>"Precisely."</P>
<P>Seven's hungry lips took command of B'Elanna's, cutting off any response,
except for the slight moans of approval. The forcefulness of the kiss surprised
B'Elanna momentarily, but she recovered, reciprocating with her own Klingon
eagerness. B'Elanna pulled Seven in possessively, not wanting to let her go.</P>
<P>The passion of the kiss seemed to last forever, and appeared to tire Seven
out. Breathless, Seven went slightly limp in B'Elanna's arms, knees weak, arms
drawn down by her side, and her face nuzzled into B'Elanna's neck.</P>
<P>"You okay?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked down at the top of Seven's head, hair still wet from the
waterfall.</P>
<P>"I believe so, I am just experiencing some disorientation, nothing to worry
about," Seven reassured unconvincingly. </P>
<P>"Disorientation? Like before?" </P>
<P>B'Elanna sat down on a rocky ledge just outside the cave mouth, holding Seven
gently in her arms. Taking her bra and Seven's bio-suit out of Seven's hands,
B'Elanna placed them on the nearest ledge without getting up.</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven answered, blinking her eyes shut tightly. "I believe the
bio-electric field is growing in intensity and interfering with my systems,
particularly my motor functions," Seven managed to get out, talking into
B'Elanna's neck.</P>
<P>"And that's something I shouldn't worry about?" B'Elanna chastised. </P>
<P>Seven responded with a tiny murmur, too tired to speak.</P>
<P>"Seven?" </P>
<P>B'Elanna's heart raced, tightly woven with fear. The change had happened so
quickly and without warning, that B'Elanna almost froze.</P>
<P>"Seven?" B'Elanna asked again with a trace of dread.</P>
<P>Seven desperately wanted to reassure her love that she was okay, but she was
unable to speak. Every time she attempted to form a word and release it,
something would grab it and take it away. The helplessness of not being able to
communicate verbally, not to mention visually, terrified the young Borg
immensely. Even worse was the fact that Seven seemed to be fully aware, her
mind, unaffected by the bio-electric interference. </P>
<P>B'Elanna saw the futile attempts at speech and tried not to panic. Almost
every cell in her body was telling her to run, hide, and just get the hell out
of there. <I>You're going to get hurt again B'Elanna. </I>She could hear herself
say, it was something she battled with all the time, since Claire. But the
stubborn half-Klingon knew she was too far into this to start running.</P>
<P>B'Elanna tilted Seven's head and saw the fear and dread that anyone would
have, if they were suddenly rendered speechless and motionless by some unseen
force. </P>
<P>"It's okay Seven, don't waste your energy trying to speak," B'Elanna said
softly, and kissed her on the forehead. "I'll take care of you."</P>
<P>Seeing the resolve in B'Elanna's eyes, brought a little comfort to Seven, who
was currently trapped in a prison of the mind with concrete walls.</P>
<P>B'Elanna's thoughts collided with each other and prevented her from doing
anything constructive. Until she could come up with some sort of plan, B'Elanna
figured the best thing was to reassure Seven that she had everything under
control. </P>
<P>The wind started to pick up a bit into a chilly breeze. Seven's shivering
gave B'Elanna a starting point for action and she looked around for anything
dry. Unfortunately everything seemed to be wet. Then she remembered her
Starfleet jacket and was sure she put it in a dry spot inside the cave. </P>
<P>B'Elanna grabbed Seven's wet bio-suit from the ledge and brought it just
inside the cave mouth along with Seven. Laying the wet suit on the sandy dirt,
B'Elanna explained that she was going inside to get her jacket and wanted Seven
to rest here. </P>
<P>"Don't worry I know what you're thinking. I'll wash your bio-suit after I get
back."</P>
<P>B'Elanna forced a smile, and kissed her lover softly on the cheek before
leaving.</P>
<P>B'Elanna ran through the dark cave. B'Elanna bumped into the side walls.
B'Elanna didn't care. Her goal was getting Seven safe and warm and she knew that
her jacket was the only dry thing to cover Seven up. Although the sun was
blazing hot, the wind had picked up again causing a cold breeze. This planet had
looked like paradise but was really a chaotic mess. </P>
<P>Finally seeing the dim light that signaled the waterfall, B'Elanna made one
final rush around the corner and began frantically looking for her jacket. She
swore under her breath knowing she had put it somewhere dry. But it was nowhere
in sight. Nervously, B'Elanna decided to wade just over ankle deep in the water
looking for her jacket. Her hands swished through the water endlessly looking
for what she was almost certain couldn't be there. But her right hand made
contact with her jacket and she felt the cold metal of her comm. badge. </P>
<P>Disheartened by her find, B'Elanna angrily threw her soaked jacket against
the wall, making a loud spat and the small distinct sound of metal against rock.
Wading back out of the pool, B'Elanna pursued her jacket and ripped at it, swung
it around and slapped it hard against the cave wall. She didn't care if she
broke her comm. badge, because the damn thing didn't work anyway on this planet,
at least not anymore.</P>
<P>Exhausted from beating her jacket and comm. badge, B'Elanna slid her back
down against a somewhat rough part of the cave wall into a sitting position. Her
hands covered her face ready for the torrent of tears she was expecting. But the
Klingon inside her knew this was not the time to cry, but the time for action.
But what action could she take with a worn down wet jacket and a non-verbal,
non-moving half Borg. </P>
<P>Besides the obvious predicament Seven was in, B'Elanna's stomach growled,
making her realize that Seven must be even hungrier since she hadn't eat very
many apples. Removing her hands from her face, B'Elanna's slightly tear-streaked
face registered a look of shock, fear, and doubt. For sitting only 4 meters on
the cave floor from her position was a basket. Inside the basket, there was a
clean white towel covering something underneath. </P>
<P>B'Elanna rubber her eyes hard, sure that it was an illusion. But the rubbing
didn't make the basket disappear. Carefully, B'Elanna inched towards the basket,
sure that this was some sort of trick. </P>
<P>"Parker!" B'Elanna shouted nervously. "Parker!"</P>
<P>But all she heard was the echo of her own voice. When she was within a meter
of the basket, B'Elanna stopped, inhaled deeply then pounced on the basket sure
that it would disappear if she didn't surprise it. Breathing intensely, B'Elanna
quickly grabbed the white towel to see what was underneath. Sandwiches, there
were sandwiches in the basket. </P>
<P>Either she was dreaming or somehow Voyager had managed to break through the
bio-electric interference, break through the life-sign masking tergralium, and
send exactly what she needed in a nice little basket. Only Voyager would never
send a basket with nicely prepared food and a towel. Voyager would have sent a
supply pack with rations and a first aid kit.</P>
<P>But B'Elanna was never one to look a gift-horse in the mouth. She grabbed the
basket and ran once again through the unforgiving dark tunnels, hoping nothing
had happened to Seven during her time away.</P>

<P>"What the hell happened to the life-sign?" Janeway cursed loudly at her
console.</P>
<P>It just disappeared. The life sign was there, then gone. Smashing her fist
against the console the Captain tried to hit it into compliance. </P>
<P>"Bring back the life-sign damn it!" </P>
<P>Her body on the verge of collapse from the hot carbon dioxide filled air,
Janeway fought hard against leaning back in her chair. The ship should have been
close enough to land minutes ago, but here she was still several kilometers away
from the surface. It was like the surface of the planet kept shrinking away
every time she got close. </P>
<P>Sweat poured into Janeway's eyes, frustrating the Captain even more than her
slippery fingers on the console.</P>
<P>In her gray tank-top, the Captain continued working over the console, trying
anything to get the life sign back. But the sensors were now offline and were
determined to stay that way.</P>
<P>The air tightened in her lungs, her eyes blurred with exhaustion, and her
arms felt like falling off. Janeway's resolve fell away as she gave into the
dying air and almost welcomed darkness. The computer's voice continually asked
the prone Captain if it should switch to auto-pilot, but an answer never came.
</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The lush botanical gardens flourished with the help of one woman. The garden
had plant species from both the alpha and delta quadrants, and some that were so
alien they seemed not of this dimension. To a non-botanist, the gardens would
have taken their breath away, but to a true lover of plants, this garden was
heaven.</P>
<P>Parker walked from plant to plant, watering the ones that needed watering,
and leaving the ones that didn't need any. It was as if Parker knew exactly what
each plant needed, even if she had never seen it before. In fact, most of the
plants Parker was surrounded by were new to her. </P>
<P>The shear number of plant species overwhelmed the young ensign. Parker had
dreamt of studying a place like this all her life, with plants of all shapes and
colors. Now she was living her dream, but for some reason it didn't feel right.
</P>
<P>Maybe it was the feeling that Kes wasn't around to see this. She had always
admired her mentor, more than most people knew. But she knew that wasn't it.
Parker wasn't sure how long she had been here, or how she had gotten here for
that matter. A small part of her kept asking the same questions over and over.
Where was Voyager? Why was she alone?</P>
<P>The questions came, but every time she tried to put her mind to answering
them, a new plant would catch her eye. And she would study it at length,
admiring its curves, its colors, and its uniqueness. The thoughts of loneliness
would disappear and she would completely forget about Voyager.</P>
<P>That was until she heard a loud crash at the perimeter of the gardens. Parker
jumped from her kneeling position and dropped the flower that was in her hand.
Startled, Parker didn't move for a couple seconds, trying to figure out just
what could have made that horrible noise, she stood still trying not to fall
into her usual lull of admiring her garden. </P>
<P>Finally, Parker got the courage to investigate the loud noise and she headed
out in the direction that she thought it had come from. But just before moving
on, Parker grabbed a javelin like branch from one the of larger plants in her
garden and held it tightly in her hand.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B'Elanna almost fell in shock and surprise when she reached the entrance of
the cave, but managed to keep the sandwiches and towel safely tucked inside the
basket.</P>
<P>"Seven… What… How… "</P>
<P>B'Elanna's jaw dropped, taking in the site of Seven standing there, slightly
limping and holding her arm. Her bio-suit still laid on the ground.</P>
<P>"I don't recall what happened." Seven answered, stepping closer to B'Elanna
while shivering.</P>
<P>Seeing Seven shiver was all B'Elanna needed to put down the basket, taking
only the clean white towel inside and wrapping it around Seven's wet body.
B'Elanna buried her head into Seven's neck, glad that she was able to move and
talk again. Another sudden unexplained change. Things were getting weirder by
the minute.</P>
<P>Seven opened her mouth to talk, but B'Elanna softly ssshhhed her. </P>
<P>"Don't talk Seven, save your energy."</P>
<P>B'Elanna put a finger against Seven's lips, silencing the Borg. A gentle kiss
said all that was needed.</P>
<P>Reveling in the warm kiss, B'Elanna almost forgot about the food. That was
something she was going to have to explain along with the towel, which B'Elanna
was sure Seven was more than curious about. And knowing Borg logic, that wasn't
going to be easy, especially since B'Elanna didn't believe it herself.</P>
<P>Reluctantly B'Elanna pulled away. Her eyes staring deeply into Seven's,
B'Elanna's whole body and mind knew everything was going to be okay as long as
they were together.</P>
<P>"I love you," B'Elanna said intently without reservation. Her heart and soul
warmed at the reaction in Seven's eyes. </P>
<P>"I love you too," Seven responded happily, overwhelmed with joy. Tears flowed
freely from both women. Eternity gripped B'Elanna and Seven in a kiss, and they
knew timelessness, love, what it meant to be loved, and everything else that
made a person feel good inside. </P>
<P>The knowledge that they couldn't live without one another was both
frightening and wonderful at the same time. They had only been together for a
couple days, but for some reason it felt a lot longer. Maybe the days were
longer on this planet, or maybe it was B'Elanna's imagination, but the sun
seemed to stay up in the sky an awfully long time.</P>
<P>Lost in B'Elanna's embrace, Seven forgot about the mysterious white towel and
basket her lover had brought out of the cave. Only when the moment ended did
Seven realize the strangeness of the situation.</P>
<P>Lifting an eyebrow and staring down at the towel wrapped around her body,
Seven queried B'Elanna with a facial expression rather than with words.</P>
<P>"I knew you were gonna ask, but believe me, you won't believe a word I say,"
B'Elanna said with a winning smile.</P>

<P>"The Delta Flyer," Parker said in shock.</P>
<P>The ship had crashed just outside the perimeter of Parker's botanical garden.
What was before a harsh desert had now become an endless wheat field. The desert
was a big reason why Parker had stayed put in the gardens, now it was gone,
replaced by a wheat field. The Delta Flyer had landed on a circular patch of
dirt, which prevented the wheat from catching on fire. </P>
<P>Small flames burned and flickered, stretching out their fiery tongues through
small holes from the broken wreck. Dropping her weapon, Parker raced passed the
last of her garden and searched for any way to pry open the door of the ship.
Hot to the touch, Parker realized that using her bare hands wasn't a bright
idea. </P>
<P>Parker ran back to get her weapon. When she examined the javelin like branch,
she decided that it was strong enough to pry open the door, so she found an edge
and began to push down, hoping the automatic opening mechanism would start and
she wouldn't have to do all the work. </P>
<P>Whoever was trapped in the burning wreck was probably unconscious by now
judging by the smoke. This urged Parker on as she made one last valiant effort
to open the door and then fell back exhausted as the door opened automatically.
A rush of thick black smoke poured out of the open door and covered the poor
ensign as she held her breath. Backing up and taking several deep breaths,
Parker made a mad rush into the ship looking for any signs of survivors. The
pressure in her head built up as she held her breath, frantically looking for
bodies in the blinding smoke and searing heat.</P>
<P>Finally, Parker was able to make out a prone Captain Janeway lying next to
the console, covered in sweat with a slightly charred tank top and black pants.
Parker strategically let out small breaths of air as she wrapped her arms around
the Captain's body and dragged her out head first. Letting out one final breath
Parker dragged Janeway down the door ramp and onto the dirt ground, safe from
harm.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>After several long arguments as to how exactly the basket full of goodies
showed up, and whether or not the food was poisonous, B'Elanna and Seven decided
that it was best to simply let one of them eat, then wait for an hour or two to
see if there were any side effects. Of course both of them volunteered to be the
guinea pig, not wanting their partner to get ill. But in the end, B'Elanna won
the argument, saying that Seven wasn't feeling too well, and that her Klingon
stomach was just plain starving and needed to eat.</P>
<P>Watching like a hawk, Seven's eyes never left B'Elanna's mouth as she took
small bites from both sandwiches. B'Elanna responded by staring back, giving her
the do you mind look. Seven realized her lover's pre-occupation with social
etiquette and not wanting someone gawking at her while she ate. So she moved
behind the hungry half-Klingon and nuzzled her lover in the neck, hearing
everyone sound, feeling every movement as B'Elanna ate. </P>
<P>Seven still wore her towel, her bio-suit along with B'Elanna's jacket and
unmentionables were drying on some rocky ledges in the waning sun. Apparently
B'Elanna didn't mind being hugged and nuzzled against while she ate, but staring
was out of the question. These human nuances often annoyed Seven, but seeing
that now B'Elanna was her lover, they were now extremely humorous.</P>
<P>After several hours of Borg observation, B'Elanna was convinced the food was
alright and decided that Seven should eat the other sandwich which she had so
thoughtfully taken a small bite out of. The young blonde hesitated, wanting
B'Elanna to eat the sandwich.</P>
<P>"You require more nutritional supplements than I do," Seven argued.</P>
<P>"You may be right on that," B'Elanna said while rubbing her belly, "but you
haven't regenerated in a while, and seeing that there aren't any Borg alcoves
around, I'd say you need this more than I do."</P>
<P>B'Elanna reached for the sandwich and held it up to Seven. The young Borg
took the sandwich thankfully and began eating, only now realizing how hungry she
actually was. B'Elanna watched with a laugh as Seven swallowed the last of the
sandwich, barely chewing any of it. </P>
<P>"Did anyone ever tell you it's good to chew your food first?"</P>
<P>Seven surprised B'Elanna with her response.</P>
<P>"Captain Janeway, actually," Seven answered, not realizing it was a
rhetorical question.<BR><BR>"Oh."<BR><BR>B'Elanna felt a pang of jealousy at
hearing Seven mention the Captain's name. Everyone on the ship knew there was
something special between Janeway and the Borg, but only some people would
actually dare say anything about it behind her back.</P>
<P>B'Elanna recalled the times she had ranted to Tom about Seven getting
preferential treatment because she was the Captain's pet. B'Elanna recalled the
times she felt angry, only now realizing it was jealousy, whenever the Captain
would put a soft hand on Seven's shoulder. B'Elanna recalled the times she
implied, in angry sarcastic tones, that Seven was Janeway's pet whenever she
argued with the young Borg. </P>
<P>"B'Elanna?" Seven asked the dazed Engineer.</P>
<P>"Huh?" B'Elanna answered, still feeling guilty about all the hurtful memories
she had dredged up.</P>
<P>"You drifted off there, so to speak," Seven answered smoothly, pulling in an
obviously troubled B'Elanna into an embrace.</P>
<P>"Oh nothing, I was just thinking."</P>
<P>"About what?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna flushed at the innocent interrogation, but realized that it was best
to tell the truth; not wanting to start off their relationship with lies.</P>
<P>"To be honest, I was thinking about when we used to fight."<BR><BR>This both
surprised Seven and gave her a stab of fear as well. </P>
<P>"Do you wish to fight?" Seven asked sadly, the painful memories drenching her
body. </P>
<P>"What?" B'Elanna said, shocked. "Of course I don't want to fight Seven, I was
just thinking about it that's all. It doesn't mean I want to fight."</P>
<P>B'Elanna pulled Seven in closer, trying to hug Seven's insecurities and fears
away.</P>
<P>Seven responded by hugging back possessively. The fear of fighting with
B'Elanna brought thoughts of losing her, and of Tom. What would happen when they
got back to Voyager? Would she leave her? Would B'Elanna go back to Tom? The
thoughts were too painful, and she simply buried her head into B'Elanna's neck,
hoping that would make them go away.</P>
<P>B'Elanna stroked Seven's silky smooth hair, no longer wet, and began combing
it down gently. The half-Klingon knew Seven was going through an emotional time,
trying to cope with feelings she never knew she had. Or maybe she did know these
feelings. </P>
<P>Janeway once again entered B'Elanna's mind, eating at her and firing her up.
What if Janeway and Seven had already done something together? The thought tore
away at B'Elanna's heart. A kiss. Something more. Everyone knew a kiss could
open the flood gates. But this was the Captain, she would never have a romantic
relationship with a crew member, would she? The fear hollowed out a hole inside
B'Elanna, making her hug Seven tighter for support. But hearing and feeling the
soft murmurs from Seven on her neck, put all doubts aside. </P>
<P>Janeway wasn't in the picture. She never was, and she never will be.</P>
<P>Confident that Seven had chosen her, and only her, B'Elanna enjoyed the
spectacular sunset coloring the horizon and laid back, holding a silent Seven I
her arms. The cold night was coming and B'Elanna knew she'd have to get their
dried clothes soon, but she decided to wait till Seven fell asleep, not wanting
to leave this moment or her true love.</P>

<P>"Surprise!"</P>
<P>The lights came on and filled the room exposing the waiting Maquis members in
hiding. With her arm draped around B'Elanna's shoulder, Claire watched her
lover's face blush bright red.</P>
<P>"I should have known you were leading me into a trap."</P>
<P>B'Elanna squeezed her lover closer around the waist and planted a wet one on
Claire's cheek.</P>
<P>"Awww," Their friends teased.</P>
<P>"Didn't I tell you what would happen if I caught you guys staring."</P>
<P>B'Elanna put one hand on her hip in mock anger.</P>
<P>Chakotay stepped through the crowd and placed a hand on B'Elanna's shoulder,
covering Claire's arm in the process.</P>
<P>"As I recall, you threatened to cut out our hearts and eat them raw."</P>
<P>Chakotay put a hand over his heart.</P>
<P>"And that's not all I'm gonna do if you don't get your hand off my
girlfriend."</P>
<P>B'Elanna grabbed Chakotay's hand and robotically removed it from Claire's
arm.</P>
<P>The entire room burst out laughing.</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked around the messy room and saw it was devoid of presents.</P>
<P>"Hey, where are all my presents?" B'Elanna scowled.</P>
<P>"Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that," Chakotay said with a grin. "We
all decided that finding presents for you would be like feeding chickens to a
rabbit. So we decided to pool our money together and donate 5 bars of
gold-pressed latinum to the Cardassian orphan fund. See here's the
certificate."</P>
<P>Chakotay handed her a napkin with a few words scribbled on it.</P>
<P>"Very funny guys, but where's the real present." </P>
<P>"Don't worry, you'll find out before the night's over," Chakotay smiled.</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked at him suspiciously then at Claire, who was feigning
innocence.</P>
<P>"Okay fine, until then, Claire and I are going back to our place."</P>
<P>B'Elanna pulled Claire closer and did a 180.</P>
<P>"Hey aren't you gonna have some of the cake," someone shouted.</P>
<P>"Don't worry I got all the cake I need here," B'Elanna almost giggled and
leaned her head on Claire's shoulder, while walking out of the room.</P>
<P>The two entered their room still draped around each other, nuzzling and
whispering naughty things in each other's ears.</P>
<P>But just when they reached the bed and B'Elanna thought something was gonna
happen, Claire pulled away.</P>
<P>"Hey, where are you going?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna's hand lingered on Claire's arm as she walked away and dove into
their closet.</P>
<P>"I'm getting your present, what else?"</P>
<P>"So you decided not to stiff my like the rest of em, huh?" B'Elanna said
while sitting back on the bed, leaning her head against the wall.</P>
<P>"Well actually, we all chipped in for it."</P>
<P>Claire held up a raggedly wrapped jumbled mess. </P>
<P>"If the present's as good as the wrapping, then I'm gonna have to return
it."</P>
<P>Claire walked over to the bed, sat down and placed the present in B'Elanna's
lap.</P>
<P>"Chakotay might take offense to such a comment," Claire smiled.</P>
<P>"You got him to wrap it?" B'Elanna said, surprised at Chakotay's
willingness.</P>
<P>"Of course. The only other person that waits on me hand and foot was getting
the present."</P>
<P>Claire squeezed the rumpled wrapping paper and present in B'Elanna's
hands.</P>
<P>"I do, do I?" B'Elanna mock snarled.</P>
<P>"Well, the guys do say I got you whipped."<BR><BR>Claire quickly jumped up on
the bed and bounced into a sitting position beside B'Elanna, wrapping her arm
around her shoulder, and gave her kiss on the cheek.</P>
<P>"I'm whipped, huh?" </P>
<P>"Yup, now open your present," Claire said excitedly.</P>
<P>"Anything else you want me to do Mistress?"<BR><BR>"Yes, but we can save that
for later on. Right now I want you to open your present."</P>
<P>B'Elanna obeyed, quickly tearing the poorly wrapped present open. Fur, fur,
more fur appeared as B'Elanna tossed the wrapping paper to the floor. </P>
<P>"You guys pooled your money for a stuffed bear?" B'Elanna said
disappointedly.</P>
<P>"Of course not. I bought the bear, and it's not just any bear, it's a special
one. See it's got itty bitty ears, a cute little muzzle, sweet little eyes and
is just so huggable."</P>
<P>Claire squeezed the ears and the muzzle, then picked up the bear and hugged
it.</P>
<P>"Okay, so It's little, what's the big deal."</P>
<P>"Well, I like to call it a messenger bear. It's the bearer of good news. No
pun intended."</P>
<P>Claire cradled the overly large locket around the bear's neck.</P>
<P>"Open it." </P>
<P>B'Elanna eyed the locket, a unusual sense of excitement and anticipation
washed over her. </P>
<P>"It's kind of big for a locket, don't you think?" B'Elanna said
suspiciously.</P>
<P>"Not this locket. Come on, open it."</P>
<P>Claire pushed the locket closer to B'Elanna. </P>
<P>Softly caressing the side of the locket, B'Elanna found the latch and popped
it open, revealing a ring. </P>
<P>Claire slipped in front of the speechless B'Elanna and held the messenger
bear under its arms, toddling it around humorously.</P>
<P>"Will you marry me," Claire said in a sweet little voice, pretending to be
the bear.</P>
<P>B'Elanna's heart exploded, her eyes watered, and her lungs collapsed. She had
always pictured that it would be her asking Claire, and now here she was on the
other end. Startled, surprised, and elated, B'Elanna stared intently into
Claire's eyes.</P>
<P>"No," B'Elanna paused for breath, "but I will marry you."</P>
<P>B'Elanna pushed the bear aside and slid her arms around Claire's neck, giving
her the longest and most passionate kiss of her life.</P>
<P>Then the dream suddenly faded and B'Elanna found herself kissing her new
love, snuggled beside her in the dim light of dawn. </P>
<P>Seven moaned softly, reciprocating the kiss with eyes closed. </P>
<P>The two moments intertwined for B'Elanna as the sun softly glowed along
Seven's face and bare shoulders, making the young Borg seem surreal. Wrapped in
B'Elanna's jacket and the mysterious white towel, the two held each other
tightly against the cold while lying on top of Seven's bio-suit.</P>
<P>B'Elanna brought her lips to Seven's forehead. Seven's entire body shivered
at the soft kiss, which seemed even more intimate than when they kissed with
their lips. It was a confirmation of their love, somehow deeper than passion,
deeper than words, and deeper than thought.</P>
<P>"I love you," the two said simultaneously, bringing a smile to both their
faces.</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked mischievously into Seven's eyes.</P>
<P>"Do you know who you are?" B'Elanna asked while caressing Seven's naked
shoulder.</P>
<P>"Seven of Nine?" The Borg answered, unsure as to the true meaning of the
question.</P>
<P>"No. You're my teddy bear," B'Elanna smiled.</P>
<P>Seven arched an eyebrow.</P>
<P>"Teddy bear?"</P>
<P>"Yeah, it's a stuffed animal."</P>
<P>Seven didn’t see the connection. </P>
<P>"How am I like a stuffed animal?" Seven inquired.</P>
<P>"Well, you're soft. You're cuddly. And you make me feel all warm inside."</P>
<P>B'Elanna kissed Seven on the tip of her nose.</P>
<P>Seven took the kiss in and closed her eyes. Eyes open again, Seven
responded.</P>
<P>"Then you are my teddy bear as well," Seven kissed B'Elanna on her
forehead.</P>
<P>This warmed B'Elanna completely. </P>
<P>"Has anyone ever told you how sweet you are?" B'Elanna asked
rhetorically.</P>
<P>Seven blushed at the compliment. </P>
<P>B'Elanna put her hand on the small of Seven's back and pulled her in closer.
</P>
<P>"When we get back to Voyager, remind me to introduce you to my messenger
bear." B'Elanna whispered into Seven's ear as she seductively claimed an
earlobe. "I think you'll be very interested in what she has to say."</P>

<P>"Seven?" Janeway said groggily while emerging from her unconscious state into
the darkness of pre-dawn and a small campfire.</P>
<P>The Captain's blurry eyes re-focused and could make out a swath of brunette
hair in front of her.</P>
<P>"You don't have brown hair," Janeway stated sleepily.</P>
<P>"Actually, I do, but Seven doesn't. I'm Ensign Parker, Captain."</P>
<P>Parker gently helped Janeway into a sitting position.</P>
<P>"Where's Seven?" </P>
<P>Janeway rubber her eyes and frantically looked around the shadowy garden.</P>
<P>"I don't know," Parker said hesitantly.</P>
<P>"What do you mean, you don't know?"</P>
<P>Janeway grabbed Parker by the shoulders. The desperate look in the Captain's
eyes frightened the young Ensign.</P>
<P>"Umm… Well, I got separated from Lieutenant Torres and Seven of Nine a while
back."</P>
<P>"Separated?"</P>
<P>"Yeah, don't ask me how, I can't remember. All I know is that I was
collecting some fruit one minute and the next, I'm in this garden."</P>
<P>"How's that possible?"</P>
<P>"Believe me, I've asked myself that question many…" Parker trailed off while
eyeing a new flower. "Wow, I haven't seen that one before."</P>
<P>Parker stepped out of Janeway's firm grasp and tried walking to the flower,
but Janeway clamped down on Parker's arm and turned her around.</P>
<P>"What are doing?" Janeway questioned angrily.</P>
<P>"I was just going to examine that flower over there."</P>
<P>Parker pointed.</P>
<P>"I asked you a direct question and I expect an answer."</P>
<P>"I'm sorry Captain, I didn't mean to offend you. It's just that this place
can be very distracting."</P>
<P>"That's okay Ensign, I know what you mean, it's beautiful, but we have more
pressing matters at hand."</P>
<P>"Of course Captain."<BR><BR>"Good. Now have you tried to re-unite with Seven
and B'Elanna?"</P>
<P>"Yes, but that stupid desert got in the way."</P>
<P>"What desert?"</P>
<P>"That's just it Captain, there was a desert surrounding this garden before
you came. When I heard the Delta Flyer crash down and I went to check on it, the
desert had mysteriously vanished and was replaced by an endless wheat field in
all directions."</P>
<P>"A wheat field?"</P>
<P>Janeway pondered the impossibility of a desert transforming into a wheat
field.</P>
<P>"Yup, just like the ones that you told us about."</P>
<P>Janeway's face reddened a bit at the comment. Apparently some people had
compared her to the doctor when it came to speeches and rambling on, and Indiana
was something she talked about often.</P>
<P>"Show me."</P>
<P>Janeway took Parker by the elbow and waited for the ensign to lead her.</P>
<P>"I'll take you back to the Flyer, it's not far from here."</P>
<P>"Good, maybe we can still fly it," Janeway said almost cheerfully.</P>
<P>"I doubt it, but anything's possible."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B'Elanna moaned softly and curled up beside Seven after their eventful
lovemaking in the glow of the morning sun.</P>
<P>"What did they put in those sandwiches?" B'Elanna yawned exhaustedly.</P>
<P>"I don't know, but I believe the sandwich rejuvenated me."</P>
<P>"I'll say," B'Elanna teased.</P>
<P>Seven smiled brightly.</P>
<P>"Remind me to get the recipe from whoever made them."</P>
<P>"I believe the recipe includes a certain seductive half-Klingon."</P>
<P>Seven smoothed the towel along B'Elanna's bare shoulder.</P>
<P>"Oh really, how about a certain not so innocent half-Borg."</P>
<P>"That may be a part of the recipe as well."</P>
<P>B'Elanna and Seven bantered back and forth, enjoying the playful side of
their new found love. </P>
<P>Seven had often wondered why humans talked so much. Now she knew why. The
subtle and not so subtle innuendo was addictive.</P>
<P>The rising sun glinting off of Seven's ocular implant was giving B'Elanna a
headache. Closing her eyes, B'Elanna gathered herself and propped herself up on
an elbow. B'Elanna took her right hand and brushed back a strand of blonde hair
over Seven's ocular implant. Leaving her hand in place, B'Elanna bridged the gap
with a kiss.</P>
<P>"Do you think you've rejuvenated enough to look for a lost Ensign?" B'Elanna
asked while laying small kisses along Seven's cheek.</P>
<P>"I believe so," Seven answered awkwardly, only now remembering there was
someone missing.</P>
<P>"Good."</P>
<P>B'Elanna finished the kissing onslaught with one final kiss on the top of
Seven's head, then she attempted to stand up while maintaining some semblance of
clothing in the chilly morning air. B'Elanna lent a hand to Seven, which was
gladly accepted.</P>
<P>"We should probably get dressed before looking for Parker," B'Elanna said
impishly.</P>
<P>"That would be advisable. I wouldn't want her seeing you naked," Seven said
possessively, while dusting off her bio-suit.</P>
<P>"Is that jealously I hear, Seven. I'm flattered," B'Elanna teased, while
putting on her tank-top.</P>
<P>"I wasn't jealous. I was only stating a social custom."</P>
<P>"Oh, and what custom would that be? Not seeing everyone naked?"</P>
<P>"To be specific, not letting anyone but me see you naked," Seven said in
growing seriousness.</P>
<P>"I don't think you have anything to worry about?"</P>
<P>"What about Lt. Paris?" Seven asked adamantly. </P>
<P>B'Elanna froze. The force with which Seven asked scared the half-Klingon to
her bones.</P>
<P>"I'm sorry Seven. I should have told you before, but I was scared."</P>
<P>B'Elanna tried putting her hand on Seven's shoulder for re-assurance, but
Seven pulled away.</P>
<P>"Scared of what?" Seven questioned, feeling deeply hurt and insecure as her
inner fears finally surfaced.</P>
<P>"I was scared that I still loved Tom. I was scared that you didn't love me. I
was scared that you loved Captain Janeway," B'Elanna pleaded desperately.</P>
<P>Seven was shocked to hear B'Elanna mention Captain Janeway. Although Seven
had often put off her feelings for Captain Janeway as simple admiration, she
knew that wasn't the truth.</P>
<P>"Do you love her, Seven?" B'Elanna pushed.</P>
<P>Seven flinched, her feelings for the Captain still strong, but her feelings
for B'Elanna even stronger. Seven hesitated painfully and was about to speak
when B'Elanna cut her off.</P>
<P>"I can't believe it, the Delta Flyer!" </P>
<P>The shining, brightly polished, Delta Flyer flew high over the distant
horizon and was heading their way, towards a naked Borg, and partly clothed
Klingon.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Captain, long range sensors are detecting two life forms," Parker informed
Janeway from her console.</P>
<P>"Is it them?" Janeway asked hopefully.</P>
<P>"Just a second. I have to recalibrate the sensors, but I believe it's
them."</P>
<P>Janeway put the Flyer on auto-pilot, walked over to Parker and looked over
the shoulder of the young Ensign.</P>
<P>When the readings came in, Janeway grabbed Parker's shoulder and gave it a
tight squeeze, relief washing over her face.</P>
<P>Setting the co-ordinates to memory, Janeway quickly sat down in front of the
main console and re-entered the new co-ordinates. </P>
<P>"We should be within visual range in under three minutes Captain," Parker
reassured unnecessarily.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Hurry." </P>
<P>B'Elanna urgently wanted Seven inside her bio-suit before the Flyer was close
enough for it's occupants to see Seven naked.</P>
<P>"I am dressing as fast as I can," Seven answered scathingly.</P>
<P>"By the time you finish, everyone will know what you look like under that
thing."</P>
<P>"Is that a problem?"</P>
<P>Seven glared at B'Elanna.</P>
<P>"Of course it's a problem. I don't want anyone seeing you naked but me,"
B'Elanna protested, hoping Seven would finish pulling up the rest of the
bio-suit.</P>
<P>"You're too late for that," Seven stated nonchalantly.</P>
<P>"What? Janeway?" B'Elanna blurted in disgust.</P>
<P>"No, the Doctor," Seven answered coolly.</P>
<P>"Oh. Well, that's expected," B'Elanna said, relief showing in her voice.</P>
<P>"Why is that expected?"</P>
<P>"Because he's the Doctor, plus he's a hologram."</P>
<P>"So you don't mind that he helps me dress every day?"</P>
<P>"What? I thought you meant checkups and stuff," B'Elanna shouted.</P>
<P>"I did not."</P>
<P>"Well, we're gonna have to talk about that when we get back to Voyager."</P>
<P>"Why not now."</P>
<P>"Because the Flyer's almost overhead of us and apparently you need help
zipping up," B'Elanna exasperated. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"What are they doing down there?" Janeway shouted, alarmed at the two figures
under 200% zooming in the view screen.</P>
<P>"Uh, I believe Lt. Torres is zipping Seven up," Parker said in
astonishment.</P>
<P>"I know that, but what *were* they doing?" Janeway cried.</P>
<P>Parker, too afraid to answer, just sat quiet at her console and watched Lt.
Torres in a tank-top, zip up their Chief Astrometrics Officer.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The Flyer's doors opened and out popped a raging Captain Janeway.</P>
<P>"What in the hell were you two doing?" </P>
<P>Janeway stared down B'Elanna with interrogating intensity.</P>
<P>"Uh, well, Seven got hurt, Captain," B'Elanna answered, startled at the
Captain's anger.</P>
<P>"Hurt?" Janeway's tone softened, while she walked over to Seven.</P>
<P>"Yeah, she fell while climbing a rocky incline, and I helped her clean the
wound on her shoulder," B'Elanna answered more confidently this time.</P>
<P>"Oh. Is that all?"</P>
<P>"Yes Captain."</P>
<P>B'Elanna avoided Seven's angry gaze. She knew the young Borg didn't like the
fact that she was hiding what happened between them, but she figured that it was
none of the Captain's business. </P>
<P>Janeway gently cupped Seven's elbow and asked which shoulder was injured.
Seven instinctively flinched and pulled back at the sudden contact, but after
realizing who it was, she apologized, saying she was just distracted.</P>
<P>"Strange, this place seems to have a habit of distracting people," Janeway
replied, remembering what had happened earlier with Ensign Parker.</P>
<P>"We should get you back to the Delta Flyer for medical treatment," Janeway
said softly, wrapping a hand around Seven's waist, much to B'Elanna's
distaste.</P>
<P>"Yes Captain," Seven answered faintly, her attention still on B'Elanna.</P>
<P>"B'Elanna, you can take command of the Delta Flyer, while I look after
Seven's injury," Janeway ordered while leading Seven back to the ship.</P>
<P>"Yes Captain!" B'Elanna overemphasized, watching the Captain shamelessly
draping herself all over the young Borg.</P>
<P>Parker watched all three women approach and said hello to Seven as she was
led to the small medical room in the Delta Flyer. Parker also watched as Lt.
Torres blew right by her and towards the main console without saying a word,
obviously steamed at something.</P>
<P>Parker closed the Flyer's doors, somewhat hurt at getting the cold shoulder
from Lt. Torres. </P>
<P>Sitting down at her console, Parker couldn't help but speak up.</P>
<P>"Are you okay Lieutenant?" Parker asked cautiously.</P>
<P>"Oh I'm fine, just fine," B'Elanna exclaimed sarcastically.</P>
<P>"Sorry, I was just asking."</P>
<P>B'Elanna felt a pang of guilt for taking out her frustrations on the poor
Ensign who was God knows where for the past couple of days.</P>
<P>"No, I'm sorry Parker. I didn't mean to take it out on you."</P>
<P>B'Elanna turned around to see Parker lift her head.</P>
<P>"It's okay Lieutenant, I'm used to people using me as a punching
bag."<BR><BR>"What, that's awful."</P>
<P>"Not literally, just verbally."</P>
<P>"Still, that's not right. Who uses you as a punching bag?" B'Elanna asked
sincerely, momentarily forgetting her own anger at what was happening in the
medical room.</P>
<P>"Oh, I can't name names," Parker said shyly.</P>
<P>"Hey, whoever it is, deserves what's coming to them. And believe me, if they
think they can treat you like their own personal holo-anger-management program,
then they got another thing coming."</P>
<P>Parker couldn't help but laugh a little under her breath .</P>
<P>"No, it's okay really, you shouldn't get involved."</P>
<P>B'Elanna was familiar with not wanting to be a rat, but some people just
weren't worth protecting.</P>
<P>"Look, how about I make you a deal. If you tell me who's bothering you I'll
pull some strings and have them adjust the duty rosters so you won't have to
deal with this person, or persons."</P>
<P>"You'd do that for me?" Parker asked hopefully.</P>
<P>"Of course, you did find me those apples, remember?"</P>
<P>"Thank you Lieutenant."</P>
<P>Parker jumped out of her seat and ran over to B'Elanna and gave her a big
hug.</P>
<P>B'Elanna awkwardly patted Parker on the back.</P>
<P>"Well, you can thank me by telling me exactly where you've been the past
couple of days and how our little Captain managed to get past the bio-electric
interference in the Delta Flyer."</P>
<P>"Oh you wouldn't believe me if I told you."</P>
<P>"Believe me, I think I would," B'Elanna replied knowingly.</P>
