-->
<P>The first person to greet B'Elanna when she was let out of the Brig was Tom.
He had roses in one hand and a bottle of wine in the other. B'Elanna had a
feeling he would do that and it made it that much harder to tell him what she
had to say. </P>
<P>Back at her quarters, Tom found the Stuffed Targ he had given B'Elanna lying
on the ground and picked it up. </P>
<P>"What are you doing on the floor?" Tom asked the stuffed animal and then
looked up to see B'Elanna over by a pink chair.</P>
<P>"When did you get that?" Tom asked.</P>
<P>"What?" B'Elanna responded, pre-occupied with the envelope that was on the
chair in question.</P>
<P>"The chair, I've never seen it before."</P>
<P>"Oh, it was a gift."</P>
<P>"A gift?" Tom said laughingly. "By who? The bad taste fairy?"</P>
<P>"You could say that," B'Elanna said, half-smiling.</P>
<P>She then sat down on the pink chair and held the mysterious envelope in her
lap, her eyes downcast.</P>
<P>"Tom, I think you should sit down."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"If it wasn't for my son Q deactivating the fail-safe device in your head,
you'd never have fallen in love with that Klingon in the first place," Seven
heard again and again in her head as she walked down the corridor.</P>
<P>That thought was quickly followed by the Captain trying to seduce her in the
Mess Hall. The Captain had arranged for the Mess Hall to be empty with candles
surrounding the table in the centre of the room. She had also insisted that the
young Borg call her Kathryn. The combination of wine, candle light and perfume
had made her nauseous. Fortunately she was able to thwart the Captain's advances
by implying that her away mission had left her too tired to eat.</P>
<P>Seven's thoughts then jumped to the end of the conversation with Q where he
had congratulated her on her answer and had given her an envelope. He had said
that it would open by itself at the appropriate time, but it had been a week,
and the darn thing still hadn't opened. Of course, she also hadn't seen B'Elanna
in a week, nor had she even talked to her. Every time she thought she had the
courage to tap her Comm Badge and contact B'Elanna, she had chickened out and
contacted somebody else. Harry, Chakotay, Tuvok and the Doctor, were beginning
to get annoyed at her non-speaking after contacting them.</P>
<P>Seven continued down the corridor, partially out-of-breath from visiting
Engineering, again and again and again, only she never walked through the door.
It had been two whole days since B'Elanna was finally let out of the Brig and
Seven had yet to see her. </P>
<P>She had heard from the Doctor that Tom and B'Elanna had broken up. He had
gone on and on about how the Pilot and the Chief Engineer were perfect for each
other, which prompted Seven to point out all the flaws in their
relationship.</P>
<P>Seven slowed down as she reached the door to Cargo Bay 2. She was hesitant to
go in, wondering if she should make one last stop by Engineering, but knew it
would be useless once she got there.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B'Elanna laid in bed looking up at the grey ceiling, exhausted from her
break-up with Tom. Surprisingly she had remained calm throughout, while Tom
called Seven everything in the book. She knew Tom wasn't going to just accept
breaking up, so she let him rant for half-an-hour, before finally sending him on
his way. </P>
<P>The half-Klingon was still a little confused as to why the Captain had let
her out of the Brig. There was no explanation, Tuvok just said she was free to
go. Of course the fact that she was in the Brig for no reason in the first
place, probably didn't sit too well with the senior officers. She was glad to be
back in her own bed.</P>
<P>Holding the envelope high over head, B'Elanna looked at it from every
possible angle, trying to see if she could catch a glimpse of what was inside.
After about ten minutes of absolutely no luck, B'Elanna put the envelope down
and tried to go to sleep, but had no luck at that either. </P>
<P>She kept thinking about how to make it up to Seven and whether or not the
young Borg would forgive her for accepting Tom's proposal. She kept reaching to
tap her Comm Badge, but could never commit to tapping it. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The doors opened and Seven walked into a dark Cargo Bay 2. The only source of
light came from the green glow of Seven's Borg Alcove and the yellow light of
candles arranged in a semi-circle in front of it. A red-colored card was placed
in the center of the candles and occupying Seven's usual space as she
regenerated was a small stuffed animal. A bear to be precise. </P>
<P>The door closed behind her, and Seven stepped closer towards the display, but
stopped when a lone figure dressed in a silky white dressed appeared from out of
the dark. B'Elanna held a single red rose in her hands.</P>
<P>"Hi," The half-Klingon smiled.</P>
<P>"Hi," Seven replied.</P>
<P>The two stared intently into each other's eyes for several seconds. B'Elanna
took a step towards the young Borg, then another, and then a third.</P>
<P>"Here," B'Elanna said, handing the rose to Seven.</P>
<P>Seven took the rose in both hands, "It's beautiful." Seven glanced at the
rose, but immediately refocused her eyes on B'Elanna.</P>
<P>"It is," B'Elanna said, taking another step closer towards the beautiful
blonde.</P>
<P>Seven then brought the tip of the rose to her nose and inhaled its fragrant
scent, "It smells nice."</P>
<P>"It does," B'Elanna replied, taking the final step to close the distance
between them. She covered Seven's hands with her own around the rose and brought
the tip of it to her own nose, inhaling the wonderful aroma.</P>
<P>Seven's eyes caressed the Chief Engineer's form, enjoying how the silky white
dress accentuated the curves of her body. </P>
<P>"You look beautiful," Seven complimented.</P>
<P>"So do you," B'Elanna said, noting that Seven was wearing her purple
bio-suit.</P>
<P>Seven's eyes then wandered over to B'Elanna's little display momentarily
before returning to meet B'Elanna's eyes.</P>
<P>The half-Klingon smiled and placed a hand on Seven's back, leading her to the
candles, the card, and the stuffed bear.</P>
<P>As Seven approached, the candles got brighter and the bear got bigger. Her
eyes were drawn towards the stuffed animal and she reached out to it, but
B'Elanna gently stopped her.</P>
<P>"No," B'Elanna placed her hand on top of Seven's outstretched one. "This
first," B'Elanna said, bending down and picking up the red card in the center of
the candles. </P>
<P>Seven took the card in her hands, while B'Elanna took the rose back. The
front was simple, a red heart with the initials B + 7 in the center of it. The
young Borg smiled, then opened up the card. Inside, there was just one word.
Sorry.</P>
<P>The one-word apology brought tears to Seven's eyes.</P>
<P>"So am I," Seven sniffled.</P>
<P>B'Elanna wiped away a tear on Seven's cheek with the back of her hand.</P>
<P>"Tom and I broke up," B'Elanna stated smoothly, looking deep into watery blue
eyes.</P>
<P>"I know, that's why I went to see you in Engineering."</P>
<P>The Chief Engineer gave Seven a puzzled look, "When?"</P>
<P>"Every hour, but I never made it through the door."</P>
<P>B'Elanna laughed out loud. </P>
<P>"How do you do it?" B'Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Do what?"</P>
<P>"Make my insides feel like Jell-O?"</P>
<P>Seven let out a little laugh, "I was going to ask you the same thing."</P>
<P>B'Elanna then took the card out of Seven's hand and placed it and the rose in
the middle of the candles. Taking one hand in each, B'Elanna again locked eyes
with Seven.</P>
<P>"Were you going to ask me to kiss you too?" </P>
<P>Seven responded by leaning closer, which prompted the half-Klingon to lean
closer as well, until their lips met. They shared a soft, gentle kiss, but the
passion that had been denied for an entire week, soon took over. B'Elanna
wrapped her arms around Seven's neck and leaned in further, needing the
closeness of Seven's body.</P>
<P>The kiss lasted for several minutes before B'Elanna reluctantly broke it off
by placing a finger to Seven's lips. </P>
<P>"I want to introduce you to a friend," B'Elanna said while pulling away, her
hand sliding down Seven's arm and then clasping tightly with Seven's hand.
B'Elanna reached into Seven's alcove and grabbed the stuffed bear with her left
hand, her right hand still in Seven's firm grasp. </P>
<P>"Here." B'Elanna handed the bear to Seven.</P>
<P>"What's its name?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Actually, she doesn't have one," B'Elanna answered. "But I'm sure we can
come up with a good name together."</P>
<P>"That would be acceptable."</P>
<P>"Yes it would," B'Elanna replied, lost in Seven's eyes. They stood there for
half-a-minute, until B'Elanna remembered what she wanted to say next, "Even
though she doesn't have a name yet, she does have a message for you."</P>
<P>"And what message would that be?"</P>
<P>"Open the locket and find out."</P>
<P>Seven eyed the dangling locket around the bear's neck, which seemed to be
bigger than any conventional locket she'd seen.</P>
<P>Slowly, Seven opened the metallic locket, hearing the latch click open,
before finally revealing what was inside.</P>
<P>Inside, a ring, fashioned with a Delta Quadrant diamond captured Seven's
eyes.</P>
<P>Before Seven could respond, B'Elanna took the stuffed bear from Seven and
bent down on one knee, holding it up by its sides and playing with its
hands.</P>
<P>"Seven of Nine," B'Elanna nearly choked, "Primary-and-Essential-Adjunct of my
heart," The half-Klingon began to tear up and had to close her eyes for a second
to regain her composure, "Will you marry me?" </P>
<P>Seven had seen this image over and over again in Voyager's holo-archives,
minus the bear, but it had always been in the third-person. She had practised
proposing for hours on end, but now she had to answer and she couldn't
speak.</P>
<P>So Seven got down on one knee, moved the teddy bear aside, and planted a soft
kiss on B'Elanna's lips.</P>
<P>The normally fiery half-Klingon closed her eyes and enjoyed the sweetness of
Seven's lips against her own, but it only lasted a second. When she opened her
eyes, Seven's face was aglow with pure joy.</P>
<P>"Is that a yes?" B'Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven answered, planting another soft kiss on her lover's lips, "But
only if you promise not to break up with me."</P>
<P>"Never," B'Elanna answered, then she took Seven in her arms and kissed her
harder, longer, softer, gentler and more lovingly than she had ever kissed
anyone in her entire life.</P>
