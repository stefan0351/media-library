<P>Seven looked over the grassy plains and managed to make out a rocky area in
the distance. Carrying the now half-conscious Chief Engineer across her arms,
she made her way as fast as she could. Sweat now dripping from her forehead and
hands as well made it difficult for her to keep a good grip on Lt. Torres. Not
even her Borg enhanced systems were able to keep her cool in this heat for long,
especially since she missed her last regeneration cycle. </P>
<P>B'Elanna shifted position and started moaning incoherently while Seven tried
to keep from dropping her. "Lt. Torres, please stop moving or I will drop you."
Seven stated to the restless half-Klingon. </P>
<P>But B'Elanna continued to struggle attempting to get free. Finally, Seven
stopped and put the struggling Engineer on the ground. Quickly unwrapping
B'Elanna's Starfleet jacket from around her waist, she tied B'Elanna's hands
together in a tight knot. Then picking her up without saying a word she held
B'Elanna's legs together tightly against her chest. B'Elanna continued to
squirm, but this time to no avail. Seven looked down across her arms, pleased
that B'Elanna was now restrained from causing any more trouble while she headed
towards the caves. </P>
<P>Not too long after, Seven managed to climb some rocks to a safe little cave
entrance protected from the searing heat of the sun. Placing B'Elanna on the
amazingly soft cave floor, Seven untied her hands and began searching the rest
of the cave. </P>
<P>Hearing a dripping sound somewhere deeper into the caves, Seven followed it
hoping to find some water. Seven made her way slowly, making sure not to stumble
on any jagged rocks. Finally coming upon the source of the dripping sound, Seven
was relieved to find that some water was trickling down from the top of the
cave, well more like gushing. The water hit the cave floor and went streaming
out under one of the cave walls, while some sunlight shone down making the water
glisten. </P>
<P>So Seven cupped her hands together to gather the falling water and began to
drink. She was surprised at how thirsty she was. Seven began to drink ravenously
and revelled in the cool taste as it travelled down her throat. She loved it so
much that she decided to step under the waterfall and ended up drenched in the
cool water. Running her hands through her hair, she tried to tie her hair back
into a bun, but it was too wet. Not that she had much experience tying it
anyway, it was the Doctor that assisted her that department. Although she was
Borg, she was not very good at doing her own hair. </P>
<P>Her thoughts went back to when she and the Doctor had picked out the
hairstyle that she would wear. The Doctor had shown her many different styles
worn by the woman on board Voyager, and some that were not. Seven secretly
admired B'Elanna's soft smooth hair style, but decided that the most efficient
would be a bun. In fact, when B'Elanna changed her hair to a curly hairstyle,
Seven secretly detested it and wanted to say something. But of course that was
never relevant. </P>
<P>Quickly her thoughts turned to the half-conscious Lieutenant that was lying
near the entrance of the caves. Worried, Seven walked briskly back the way she
came. Finding B'Elanna unmoving, Seven tried to wake her. "Lt. Torres, are you
awake?" Seven cupped the back of B'Elanna's head. "Lt. Torres, please respond."
Seven waited several anxious moments before she got what she was waiting for.
</P>
<P>"Mmmm, yeah, kinda." B'Elanna managed to trickle out while holding her
forehead.</P>
<P>"That is fortunate, for I thought that you had passed out again. I have found
a small waterfall deeper into the caves, you may want to get a drink and cool
down." Seven suggested, relieved that B'Elanna was okay.</P>
<P>"Is that what you were doing? You're all wet Seven." B'Elanna managed to
chuckle. In all her years, she had never imagined the Borg being soaked in
water.</P>
<P>"Yes. It was relaxing." Seven said embarrassed.</P>
<P>"I'll bet, now help me up so I can get soaked." B'Elanna said humorously.</P>
<P>"Aye, Aye Captain." Seven joked. They simply stared at each other and
smiled.</P>
<P>Seven wrapped her right arm around B'Elanna's back and under her arm, and
placed B'Elanna's left arm around her neck. Half carrying the exhausted
Lieutenant, the two made their way towards the waterfall.</P>
<P>Turning the corner, B'Elanna was in awe at the beauty of the waterfall and
the light that cascaded down along with it. "Wow." Was all B'Elanna could
say.</P>
<P>"Wow, what?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"It's beautiful, that's what." B'Elanna said while letting go of Seven and
making her way for the water. At first B'Elanna simply let her hand under it, as
if testing to see if it was really there. Then she let the water fall on her arm
and watched as it flowed down to the ground. Cupping her hands together she
splashed the water onto her face, rather than drinking it. </P>
<P>Seven watched the water cascade off of B'Elanna's body in wonder. Suddenly
she found it hard to breathe.</P>
<P>B'Elanna finally took the final step into the waterfall and let it crash down
over her entire body, relishing every moment of it. Cupping her hands together
once more, she took a long satisfying drink, lost in the wonderfully cool
feeling that was washing over her. </P>
<P>Seven stared in awe as B'Elanna turned around to face her. "Thank you,
Seven." B'Elanna smiled.</P>
<P>"You are welcome." Seven swallowed.</P>
<P>"Aren't you going to have a drink?" B'Elanna asked holding her cupped hands
forward.</P>
<P>"I... have already drank enough." Seven exhaled.</P>
<P>"Suit yourself, but you never know when this thing will dry up." B'Elanna
took another long drink.</P>
<P>Seven noticed that B'Elanna's nipples had hardened under her grey tank-top,
and this caused her knees to weaken tremendously.</P>
<P>In a shaky voice Seven managed to squeak out, "I will head back to the
entrance and search the other caves for Ensign Parker."</P>
<P>"Okay, I'll do the same once I'm done." B'Elanna watched as Seven more or
less stumbled her way around the corner of the cave. Turning around, B'Elanna
let the water rain down on her face. </P>
<P>Seven managed to make it around the corner without making a complete fool of
herself. She held onto a rock for support, thinking there was something
seriously wrong with her. Her breathing was faster than normal, her heartbeat
was racing, and her temperature seemed at an all time high, not to mention loss
of balance. </P>
<P>Seven's curiosity got the best of her when she settled herself down. She
peeked around the corner of the cave and began to watch B'Elanna bathe under the
streaming water. This time though, watching from behind a large boulder, safe
from B'Elanna's eyes.</P>
