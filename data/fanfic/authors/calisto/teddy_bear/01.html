<P>Seven walked into the mess hall in her usual arrogant demeanor. Of course
that wouldn't be much of a problem if she wasn't also drop dead gorgeous. Half
the guys in the mess couldn't help but steal glances here and there as they went
about eating. More like nibbling, no one wanted to look like a pig wolfing down
a meal in front of her. </P>
<P>What they didn't realize was that Seven was completely aware of the effect
that she had on many of the crewmen, for instance Ensign Harry Kim. He was so
obviously attracted to Seven, that it often amused her to watch him struggle
with his words. Of course it also irritated her because it was so inefficient.
Amusement was one of the many emotions that she had learned while on board
Voyager.</P>
<P>As Seven silently walked up to the counter, the furry-haired Talaxian had his
back turned looking for some Barion Spices he had picked up a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>"Neelix, I require these nutritional supplements." Seven held out the list to
a startled cook who almost dropped the very spices he had been looking so hard
for. "You know, you really should stop sneaking up on me like that. The Doctor
tells me it's not good for the old heart."</P>
<P>Seven looked at him awkwardly. "I apologize for frightening you. I will
announce my presence upon entering all rooms you are present in next time."</P>
<P>"Well I don’t' know if that will be necessary. All I ask is that you don't
just suddenly appear in front of me with a blunt object raised near my face."
</P>
<P>Seven gave him a funny look. "That was a joke" She stated. Neelix laughed and
patted her on the shoulder. "Indeed it was. Now let's see what I can do about
these nutritional supplements the Doctor wants you to ingest." He looked at the
list and began thinking about all the wonderful ways he could put the list of
ingredients together. Unfortunately, the Doctor had a way of always listing the
most unappetizing nutritional supplements possible. </P>
<P>Neelix looked up from the list and motioned Seven towards the tables. "Now go
find a seat and I'll be right out with something new and delicious for your
taste buds." </P>
<P>Unlike her, Seven fought back the urge to tell him that she doubted the meal
would be delicious as he claimed it would be. The last time Neelix said he was
cooking up something delicious, she had to swallow the meal as fast as possible,
as to avoid tasting it for very long. The Doctor had briefed her on being
considerate towards other people's feelings.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for Lt. Torres, Seven had a way of being so inconsiderate in
engineering, that she had designed her own holo-deck program featuring the very
Borg that she so despised. In this program B'Elanna would play herself in
engineering, and if Seven got out of line, she would take out all her
frustrations on Seven in front of the simulated staff. Stuff she knew she
couldn't do in real life, because she knew Janeway would have her thrown in the
Brig.</P>
<P>Torres looked up from her soup only to find the beautiful Borg standing right
in front of her. "May I join you Lt. Torres?" B'Elanna was stunned. Seven had
actually asked her, as opposed to just doing it, and having her find out later.
B'Elanna said "Sure," kind of annoyed that the Borg had chosen her of all people
to sit down next to. </P>
<P>After all the battles they had fought in engineering, she thought Seven would
have avoided her at all costs. Apparently Seven didn't take any of B'Elanna's
insults personally, because otherwise Seven would be asking someone else if she
could sit down next to them. </P>
<P>Seven simply stared at B'Elanna, as if expecting her to initiate the
conversation. This annoyed the half-Klingon even more. Seven had a way of making
her nervous, maybe it was the fact that she was so blunt and never sugar-coated
anything she said. "Well, aren't you gonna say something Seven?" B'Elanna asked,
hoping the Borg's stare would waiver, but of course it never did. </P>
<P>"I am curious as to why you were so adamant at being named the leader of this
away mission." Seven stated bluntly. "Oh, so that's what's on your mind."
B'Elanna sounded relieved, as she was almost certain that Seven was curious
about her sexual relations with Tom, again! "Well, you see, I've always had a
thing for green trees, rolling country sides and beautiful sunsets. And this
planet seems to have it all." B'Elanna said almost dreamily. </P>
<P>"I do not understand the human fascination with beauty in inanimate objects
or settings. In fact, I do not understand the human fascination with beauty at
all. It is simply a subjective opinion, most likely learned from one's parents
or social upbringing." Seven sounded off.</P>
<P>"That's exactly your problem Seven. You have to learn to appreciate beauty in
all it's forms. Otherwise what's the point in living?" B'Elanna was so sure that
Seven would give one of those Tuvok like responses, but surprisingly Seven
seemed mystified. "I do not know what the point in living is." She sounded
unsure of herself.</P>
<P>"Wow, for once I got you stumped. Where's that Borg perfection when you need
it?" B'Elanna resounded sarcastically. Seven crooked an eyebrow. "That is
precisely the problem. When I was a drone my purpose to living was defined. Now
I am no longer certain as to what my purpose is.</P>
<P>B'Elanna was beginning to feel slightly more comfortable with the Borg Ice
Queen she had grown to hate so much. Maybe it was the fact that the perfect Borg
had become imperfect and uncertain for the time being. "Well, you could always
say your purpose is to serve Voyager and her crew. But I bet we can think of
something a little less Tuvokian than that. B'Elanna laughed out loud. </P>
<P>"I believe that was a joke regarding Tuvok and his Vulcan logic." Seven
crooked her neck at B'Elanna. "You're damn right it was. And there's a lot more
where that came from." B'Elanna felt like she was Janeway teaching Seven the
subtleties of human behavior. "So the Doctor's been briefing you on how to
recognize jokes. Too bad he didn’t' teach you how to laugh at them." </P>
<P>"I believe you are being sarcastic. It is common for humans to try to mask
their nervousness with humor." Seven was becoming like, well Seven again.
"Thanks for being so observant. Maybe you should stop hanging around Tuvok so
much, I think he has a bad influence on you."</P>
<P>"In what way?" Seven seemed curious. "Well, stating the obvious for one.
Nothing's more annoying than having someone state obvious human behavior. And
you and Tuvok seem to have that down pat." </P>
<P>"I am sorry, I will attempt to no longer state obvious human behavior. I did
not realize that it annoyed you so much." Seven sounded sincere. "Gee, thanks."
B'Elanna was speechless. She had never expected the Borg to apologize to anyone,
least of all her.</P>
<P>At that moment Neelix came stumbling over with a tray filled with all sorts
of weird dishes. "Here you go Seven, something to try out all of your taste buds
in one sitting. "Wonderful." Seven sounded less than pleased. </P>
<P>The familiar sound of the communicator echoed through the air. "Doctor to Lt.
Torres." B'Elanna tapped her communicator. "Torres here, what's up Doc?" </P>
<P>"What's up is that you are late for your immunization before you head down to
the planet. You know that you need the shot a full 24 hours before going down
there. Even with your enhanced Klingon immune system, you never know what kind
of evil viruses lurk in the beauty of those green trees, rolling country sides
or in the air while you watch the sunset." He stated, sounding very upset at
being forced to wait for an unruly and inconsiderate patient. Apparently
B'Elanna had told more than one person how much she was looking forward to this
away mission. Although the warp core was something to behold, her eyes got
rather tired of looking at the glowing cylinder. She needed some real natural
beauty to appreciate.</P>
<P>"Sorry Doc, I lost track of time. I'll be over there ASAP. Torres out." She
tapped the communicator one more time to cut off the Doc's inevitable response
and stood up to leave. "Well it looks like you'll be eating alone Seven. I guess
I'll see you tomorrow in the transporter room." It was Janeway's idea that Seven
be part of the away team. The planet so resembled Earth that she wanted Seven to
enjoy some of it. Initially Janeway was to lead the team but she got caught up
in administrative duties. </P>
<P>B'Elanna said goodbye and left, while Seven had to deal with Neelix asking
how every dish on the tray tasted.</P>

<P>"Ok team lets go." B'Elanna motioned Seven and Ensign Parker onto the
transporter. Parker was in charge of the Hydroponics lab after Kes left them.
She had studied under Kes for some time and was more than happy to take over for
her mentor. </P>
<P>Normally the away team for M-Class planets would be larger than 3 people, but
they had recently engaged some alien vessels in combat and had many repairs to
do. That's why it took a lot of convincing on B'Elanna's part to lead this
mission. </P>
<P>"Beam away Ensign Fowler." B'Elanna was beaming as she would finally get a
little taste of home, even though there were some slight differences from Earth.
Before she knew it, B'Elanna was standing in an open field looking at some
rolling hills and a bright yellow sun over head. </P>
<P>"Alright team, time to get to work. Parker, see if you can find some edible
plants within a 1 km radius. Seven, monitor for any animal life signs that could
be a potential threat. I'll be over by those trees looking for something."
B'Elanna tried to start leaving for the trees she had pointed out when Seven's
curiosity got in the way, again. </P>
<P>"What exactly are you looking for Lt. Torres?" Seven queried. "Well, I want
to see if I can find some apples, okay." B'Elanna said impatiently. "Now, if you
don't mind, I'm gonna go search for some, and you can start to do your job."
B'Elanna started walking away when Seven spoke up again.</P>
<P>"Apples, a fruit originating from Earth. Many species find the fruit
repulsive, particularly Klingons. It is highly unlikely that you will find the
same fruit here on this planet in the Delta Quadrant. Therefore, making it an
inefficient use of time." Seven responded, feeling good at disobeying a direct
order from Torres once again.</P>
<P>"So I'm probably the only half-Klingon in the whole Universe that likes
apples, and it probably is a waste of time as you so eloquently put it. But I
just gave you an order and you're gonna follow it. So stop talking and start
doing." B'Elanna was getting flashbacks of her Engineering Holo-Program, and
they weren't very nice. </P>
<P>Seven decided not to pursue the argument as she felt she had won. For some
odd reason, Seven always felt good at making B'Elanna angry. She could not
explain this feeling, but it definitely made her wonder.</P>
<P>Several hours later, B'Elanna came stumbling out of the forest with her
Starfleet jacket in one hand, and some round purple fruit in the other. She
managed to walk over to where Ensign Parker and Seven were sitting without
dropping any of the fruit.</P>
<P>"Okay, granted, they aren't apples but they taste mighty good." She dropped
her jacket on a rock and took a big bite from one of the fruits. Trying to
convince Seven it wasn't a waste of time. Ensign Parker quickly added, "Nice
work Lt., but I found some greenish-red fruit that looks a little more like what
you're looking for." She handed B'Elanna what seemed pretty close to an apple.
B'Elanna, dropped the fruit she was holding and grabbed the alien apple from
Parker so fast, she thought she was bitten by a snake. Taking deep bites into
the fruit, she thought she was in heaven. "Oh, you are so gonna get a promotion
for this Parker, these are delicious." B'Elanna mumbled while chewing on the
alien apple. </P>
<P>"I fail to see how finding a certain type of fruit warrants a promotion."
Seven was puzzled. "Take it easy Seven, I was being sarcastic. I just meant that
I owe her a big favor and if she happens to be up for a promotion, I'll put in a
good word for her." Ensign Parker seemed to be beaming with the same enthusiasm
as B'Elanna at hearing those words. </P>
<P>Seven was going to respond but was cut off by B'Elanna. "Hey, how'd you know
I was looking for apples? I only told Seven about it." B'Elanna put out her hand
gesturing for another apple. "Well, when I came back to the transport site
heading in the other direction to search for more food, Seven seemed perturbed.
So I asked her what was wrong, and she said you were inefficiently using your
time here looking for apples. I just happened to come across some of them when I
searched the trees over there." She pointed to a patch of trees that B'Elanna
had decided was too far from the transport site to go looking. The patch was on
a high hill about 2 km away.</P>
<P>"Hey, didn’t I tell you to look for food within a 1 km radius?" B'Elanna
asked jokingly. "Well, I guess I accidentally dropped my tricorder and couldn’t
tell how far I was from the transport site." She answered trying to sound as
serious as possible and about to burst into laughter. "Well, I guess that
doesn't qualify as disobeying a direct order then." B'Elanna emphasized the word
guess. The two couldn't hold it in any longer and they burst out laughing. </P>
<P>Seven merely observed at the two interacting in this manner. It often
confused her as to why the crew found it humorous to engage in this type of
sarcastic talk. Only right now she felt something other than confusion. Seven
was feeling uncomfortable at how Lt. Torres and Ensign Parker were getting
along. Almost every encounter she had with the half-Klingon was an argument. The
only time she didn't argue with her was 24 hours ago in the mess hall. </P>
<P>B'Elanna and Parker were getting a little too close for comfort and Seven
stepped between the two and stated "I believe we are finished here and should
report back to the ship." B'Elanna backed off a little from the sudden
closeness. "Okay, but make sure you mark down the location of that apple patch,
I don't want to run out of apples before tonight."</P>
<P>Seven tapped her comm badge. "Seven to Voyager, 3 to beam up."</P>
<P>They waited silently for a reply but none came. "Odd, they should of
responded by now. Seven to Voyager, 3 to beam up." The three waited for another
20 breathless seconds. B'Elanna tapped her comm badge and asked if anyone on
Voyager could hear them, but to no avail. </P>
<P>"Great, I'm stuck down here with a Borg for company and my only apple supply
is 2 km away." She sat down on a rock. "Well, on the bright side the weather's
pretty good and I still have one apple left." She looked to where Ensign Parker
had put the apples, but there were no more. </P>
<P>She frantically looked around. "Hey, who took the last apple?" B'Elanna
turned to see Seven biting down on the last apple Ensign Parker had brought with
her. "You are correct Lt. Torres, apples are delicious." </P>

<P>Janeway paced back and forth on the bridge worried sick about what could be
happening to the away team down on the planet. But secretly she was worried that
Seven would push Torres too far and she would just explode. Janeway and the rest
of the crew were well aware of the effect that the Borg had on Lt. Torres.
Janeway looked up and asked for the hundredth time, "Anything Tuvok?" </P>
<P>"Still no comm link from the away team Captain. None of the measures we have
taken have been able to penetrate the bio-electric field around the planet."
Tuvok answered coolly. </P>
<P>"Well, keep trying Tuvok. You never know when communications might come back
on line. I'll be in my ready room, call me the moment you figure something out."
With that Janeway left the bridge hoping she didn't look too rattled. The
bio-electric field had come up around the planet an hour after planet fall.
Voyager had tried to contact the away team but failed. Now the senior staff was
working around the clock to get communications back on line.</P>
<P>Back on the planet, Janeway's worries were about to come true. B'Elanna was
breathing heavily. "Okay, let me get this straight. We're trying to contact
Voyager, and you suddenly decide to take a bite out of my last apple." B'Elanna
shot Seven a look that most crew members would have dread. Even Ensign Parker
couldn't bear to watch. </P>
<P>Seven returned the look in her cool Borg manner. "Lt. Torres I believe you
are hyper-ventilating and should seek medical attention immediately."</P>
<P>"What?" Torres screamed. "You're the one that should be seeking medical
attention after I'm done with you. B'Elanna stepped closer to Seven intent on
living out her holo-deck fantasy. Ensign Parker took a peak at the situation and
spoke up to stop B'Elanna from doing something she knew she would regret. "Lt.
Torres?" Parker squeaked. </P>
<P>B'Elanna turned agitatedly. "What?" </P>
<P>"Ummm… If you want I could go get some more apples right now. I promise I'll
be back before you know it." Parker hoped this would help diffuse the explosive
situation.</P>
<P>B'Elanna was about to scream that this wasn't about apples, it was the fact
that Seven took something that was hers without asking. But somehow, somewhere a
voice inside her head told her to take the opportunity that Ensign Parker had
given her to get out of this situation.</P>
<P>B'Elanna breathed heavily and nodded an okay. Ensign Parker quickly got up
and ran towards the apple patch 2 km away. B'Elanna on the other hand silently
picked up her tricorder and started scanning for what could be interfering with
their comm link. Inside she was fuming, but she tried her best ignore Seven
munching on her apple. B'Elanna kept telling herself that once she figured out a
way to make contact with Voyager and got back to the ship, she would kick
whoever it was out of holo-deck 1 and start up her favorite program. </P>
<P>While B'Elanna was looking at the readings on the tricorder, Seven decided
that it would be more efficient if she helped. So she dropped her half-eaten
apple to the ground and picked up her tricorder. "I believe I may be of
assistance." Seven offered. B'Elanna turned around to see the apple on the
ground and just lost it. "You bitch!" B'Elanna rushed at Seven and took a swing
with her right fist. Seven with her Borg enhanced reflexes caught B'Elanna's arm
easily. B'Elanna dropped the tricorder in her left hand ready to use her left
fist instead. But it was just as easily snatched up by the blonde Borg. B'Elanna
looked straight into Seven's face without flinching and breathing angrily. They
were nose to nose when Seven spoke up. "Your attempts to strike me will
undoubtedly fail. </P>
<P>B'Elanna struggled with all her strength to get her arms free from Seven's
grasp, but was unsuccessful. "Let me go! That's an order Seven, or would you
rather I report your actions to Captain Janeway?" Seven quickly let go of her
grasp as if the half-Klingon's arms had burned her. B'Elanna was surprised to
say the least. Everyone knew that Seven and the Captain were close, but the way
Seven reacted when B'Elanna threatened to tell the Captain, made her think that
there might be something more to the relationship. </P>
<P>Although Seven had constantly questioned the Captains orders in front of the
crew, she had grown to respect Janeway's stubborn attitude. And she didn't want
to disappoint her mentor on something so trivial. </P>
<P>B'Elanna rubbed her arms, and teased "What's a matter Seven, don't wanna
upset your Captain?" She had to emphasize the word your. She knew she was
walking a fine line, but somehow she doubted this conversation would be heard by
anyone other than the two of them.</P>
<P>Seven picked up the tricorder B'Elanna had dropped in the struggle and tried
her best to ignore B'Elanna's tease. "I believe we should get back to solving
our current predicament." Seven had tried the human equivalent of changing the
subject. B'Elanna looked puzzled, as she never took Seven to feel uncomfortable
about anything. After all, Seven never seemed to mind bringing up other crew
members sex lives in full surround sound. </P>
<P>Seven analyzed the tricorder readings hoping for something to stop the
torture of B'Elanna's stare. At last she found what she was looking for. "It
seems that a bio-electric field is interfering with our communications, and thus
must also be interfering with Voyager's sensor array. Therefore, we will not be
able to beam off the surface until Voyager can come up with a means of
penetrating the field." Seven sounded relieved.</P>
<P>B'Elanna still wanted an answer to her question but was curious about Seven's
findings. "What do you mean a bio-electric field?" B'Elanna stepped closer to
Seven and grabbed the tricorder. </P>
<P>"A bio-electric field is emanating from an unknown source, and seems to be
surrounding the planet. Thus, blocking further communication with Voyager."
Seven was extremely glad Lt. Torres did not push the issue with Captain
Janeway.</P>
<P>B'Elanna stared at the readings, thinking that it had to be wrong. "How is
this possible? I haven't seen anything bigger than a fox on this planet." Torres
continued to study the readings. Seven picked up her own tricorder. "I believe I
can recalibrate the three tricorders we have to emit a single signal to
Voyager." Seven recommended. B'Elanna was skeptical, but decided they had no
other alternative at the moment. </P>
<P>"Okay, since I see no other option, you can recalibrate both Ensign Parker's
and your tricorder, while I use mine to try and figure out where this
bio-electric field is coming from." B'Elanna was finally starting to calm down
and figured that she had more than enough time to tease Seven about Janeway.
</P>
<P>"Very well, I will start immediately." Seven took Ensign Parker's tricorder
and began to recalibrate it in her Borg efficient manner. B'Elanna walked some
20 meters away from the transport site, so as to put some distance between
herself and the Borg she had almost struck a short time earlier. "What the hell
was I thinking." She muttered to herself. "If I had actually hit her, Janeway
would of probably sent me to the Brig and left me there for the rest of the ride
home." B'Elanna scolded.</P>

<P>About half an hour after B'Elanna and Seven had decided to work on finding a
way to communicate with Voyager and determine the source of the bio-electric
field, Seven announced that she needed B'Elanna's tricorder to finish her job.
B'Elanna decided that it was no use scanning for the source of the field, and
gladly handed her tricorder over to Seven. </P>
<P>Seven took it and began to recalibrate it like she did the others. B'Elanna
took in a deep breath and suddenly noticed the beautiful sunset that had formed
in the direction of the apple patch. She closed her eyes and opened them again
to make sure that it was in fact real. It had a mixture of red, orange and
yellow, with some purple at the top to make it just perfect. B'Elanna drifted
into thought about the sunsets she use to watch when she was on Earth and felt
like she was finally home again. </P>
<P>B'Elanna lied down on her side with her elbow on the ground and her hand
supporting her cheek, taking in the beauty of the planet. "Beautiful." She
whispered to herself. But Seven's enhanced Borg hearing caught it like it was a
normal statement. "Beautiful?" Seven questioned. </P>
<P>"What?" B'Elanna was shocked and surprised that Seven had overheard her.
B'Elanna turned her head to see Seven staring at her, no longer working on the
tricorder. "I believe you made a comment saying that something was beautiful. I
was only inquiring as to what was beautiful." Seven held her stare.</P>
<P>"Well, I was just saying that the sunset was beautiful, that's all." B'Elanna
tried to put it off, hoping Seven would stop her stare and return to work. But
of course the stare never wavered. "So this is what you describe as beautiful. I
do not understand why this particular mixture of colors qualify as beautiful,
while others do not." Seven was curious again. </P>
<P>B'Elanna was caught off guard, she expected the blonde Borg to simply state
that it was a waste of time. Then it hit her, this conversation started in the
mess hall, the first time the two had actually talked. "Well, I guess it's just
like you said Seven, beauty is in the eye of the beholder and is probably
learned from social upbringing. Nevertheless, I still say this sunset is
beautiful, and so would the majority of the crew." B'Elanna broke the stare with
those beautiful blue eyes and turned back to watch the sunset. </P>
<P>Seven waited a moment before she spoke, as if contemplating the meaning of
those words. "And this beauty, does it make you happy?" B'Elanna was surprised
at the questioning, but decided that Seven was just being curious about human
nature. B'Elanna turned around fully this time to face the Borg. "In a way yes,
and in a way no." She knew this would confuse the Borg. "Explain?" Was all Seven
could muster. </P>
<P>"Well, it does make me happy because it's so beautiful and it reminds me of
home. It also makes me sad for the very same reason." B'Elanna saw a hint of
understanding in Seven's eyes. "I believe I now understand Lt. Torres, thank you
for this enlightening… chat." And with that their conversation ended and they
both went back to what they were doing. B'Elanna enjoyed the sunset, while Seven
worked on the tricorder. </P>

<P>Approximately 15 minutes later, Seven finished with B'Elanna's tricorder.
B'Elanna was in a dream-like state mesmerized by the luminescence of the sunset.
She was taken out of this state by Seven's voice. "I have finished recalibrating
all three tricorders, Lt. Torres. We can now attempt to contact Voyager." </P>
<P>B'Elanna rubbed her eyes and turned to see Seven standing over the three
tricorders perfectly placed on the ground in a triangular arrangement. "Great,
let's give it a go." B'Elanna slowly got up and headed towards Seven. </P>
<P>"Very well. But I must warn you that we can only make one attempt. After
that, the tricorders will no longer have enough power to emit a signal through
the bio-electric field." Seven began to initiate the signal. </P>
<P>"Thanks for the warning Seven." B'Elanna quipped. Seven crooked her neck up.
"I felt it was my duty to warn you." Seven totally misunderstood her. "I was
being sarcastic Seven, you know like I was in the mess hall." B'Elanna couldn't
help but laugh at the misunderstanding. </P>
<P>"I am sorry, this bio-electric field seems to be affecting some of my
implants." Seven said while attempting to balance herself on a rock nearby.
B'Elanna noticed the Borg's balancing act. "You okay Seven." To B'Elanna's
surprise, she was genuinely concerned. </P>
<P>Seven regained her composure. "I am fine. We should find out if the signal
was successful in approximately 1 minute." Seven stood up to her full height and
held her hands behind her back. </P>
<P>"Great." B'Elanna felt uneasy for some reason. There was a long moment of
silence as they waited for Voyager to respond. After about 2 minutes of silence
Seven spoke up. "I believe the signal has failed. If it had made it through we
would have heard from Voyager by now." Seven locked a stare on B'Elanna as if
waiting for orders. </P>
<P>"Well maybe they just have to figure out how to send a signal through the
bio-electric field." B'Elanna responded. </P>
<P>Seven continued her stare. "Unlikely. They have had far more time to devise a
method of penetrating the field. If they received our signal, they would have
been able to send a message directly to our co-ordinates." Seven picked up one
of the tricorders.</P>
<P>B'Elanna knew Seven was probably right. "True. So what are you doing now?"
B'Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"I am scanning for any vacant caves so that we may take shelter in one after
nightfall." Seven was her usual Borg efficient self. B'Elanna couldn't believe
that she would have to spend the night in a cave with Seven. B'Elanna looked up
at the sky. "Not a cloud in the sky Seven, I think we can hold off that search
until at least tomorrow." B'Elanna to a refreshingly deep breath. </P>
<P>"Procrastination is not in my nature." Seven finished her scans. "There is a
cave 4.5 km north-east of this location." Seven looked up waiting for a response
from Lt. Torres. </P>
<P>B'Elanna was kind of hoping Seven didn't find any caves. "Okay." B'Elanna
said disappointed. "We'll head for them after Ensign Parker comes back. If it's
too dark by then, we'll just have to camp out under the stars." B'Elanna said
satisfied that Parker wouldn't return until she was sure the volatile situation
she left had calmed down. </P>
<P>"Very well." Seven started walking towards the apple patch. B'Elanna
followed. "What exactly are you doing?" She said walking up right next to Seven.
Seven simply turned her head. "I am retrieving Ensign Parker so that we may
begin our journey towards the caves I located." Seven continued to walk and talk
while B'Elanna followed. "Just a minute there Seven." B'Elanna grabbed Seven's
left arm to slow her down. "Wouldn't it be more efficient if we just waited for
her, rather than have you walk 2 km to find her, then another 2 km back here?"
B'Elanna thought she had her. "Actually, it would be more efficient if you
accompanied me there, than we could all head to the caves immediately." Seven
knew, rather than thought she had B'Elanna beat. </P>
<P>"True again. But I'd much rather stay here and wait for Ensign Parker.
Besides, you never know when Voyager may be able to send a signal through the
bio-electric field." B'Elanna was triumphant and she knew it. Seven was
disturbed that she had been beaten, for she was sure she had won. It seems the
bio-electric field was interfering more with her implants than she had
previously thought.</P>
<P>"Very well." Seven stopped and looked at her left arm, which Lt. Torres still
had a grip of.</P>
<P>"Oh, sorry." B'Elanna let go embarrassed that she had to hold onto the Borg
to slow her down.</P>
<P>"So I guess we should just sit down and wait for Ensign Parker, or a signal
from Voyager, whichever comes first, eh Seven?" B'Elanna found a smooth patch of
grass and sat down. She reached up with her right hand towards Seven. "Come on
Seven, have a seat." </P>
<P>Seven obliged, not knowing exactly why. She would have preferred to stand but
decided it was in their best interest to keep arguing to a minimum. And she knew
Lt. Torres would have made a big deal about her not sitting. So there the two
sat, B'Elanna with her hands about her knees enjoying the last of the sunset,
while Seven sat awkwardly cross-legged. </P>

</table>

<P>As the darkness of night engulfed Lt. Torres and Seven of Nine, a cool breeze
began to blow in from the north-east. At first it was a small and barely
noticeable, but as the minutes passed, the wind got stronger. B'Elanna wrapped
her arms around her body and began to shiver slightly. "Wow, it's getting pretty
cold all of a sudden." B'Elanna looked at Seven who sat beside her. "Well, I
guess it doesn't matter to you, after all you're Borg and you can stand the cold
unlike me." B'Elanna wrapped her arms tighter and began to rub her arms to keep
warm. </P>
<P>Seven looked slightly concerned. "You are correct Lt. Torres, my Borg
implants allow me to regulate temperature more efficiently than Humans or
Klingons." Seven reached out her left hand and placed it on B'Elanna's right
shoulder. "You are shaking Lt. Torres." </P>
<P>B'Elanna slipped her shoulder out of Seven's grasp. "It's nothing, really.
I'm just cold, I'll be alright in the morning. I just need some sleep." B'Elanna
had begun to lie down, when a hand grabbed her right arm. Seven moved closer to
B'Elanna and within seconds she had her arms wrapped around the Chief Engineer.
</P>
<P>"What are doing Seven?" B'Elanna was shocked by the turn of events and tried
to free herself from the Borg's hold. Seven's breasts were snugly pressed
against B'Elanna's right side. "I am attempting to keep your body at 40 degrees
Celsius. If your body falls below that you will eventually suffer from
hypothermia. My body heat will provide you with enough warmth until morning."
Seven continued to tightly hold onto Lt. Torres. </P>
<P>B'Elanna tried in vain to free herself. "I don't think a little cold is gonna
kill me Seven, now let go." Seven simply stated, "That would not be a in our
best interest, as the temperature has fallen dramatically over the past half
hour." Seven's face had moved closer to B'Elanna's, and the Chief Engineer was
beginning to feel real uncomfortable. </P>
<P>B'Elanna's heart was racing and she was getting red in the face. She knew
that Seven was right, but it didn't mean that she had to like it. "Okay fine you
win, but this conversation never happened. In fact this whole situation never
happened, got it?" B'Elanna turned to look Seven in the eyes and was surprised
that she ended up almost nose to nose with the blonde Borg.</P>
<P>Seven was very familiar with this demand, as she had heard it from Captain
Janeway on a number of occasions. So she said yes, hoping that B'Elanna would
stop trying to get free. Sure enough Lt. Torres stopped fighting and began to
slowly relax. B'Elanna put her head down not wanting to look into those
captivating blue eyes anymore. B'Elanna thought she had felt something when she
saw Seven looking back at her with genuine concern, but she told herself that
the cold was just getting to her.</P>
<P>B'Elanna began rubbing her arms again, only Seven's arms were in the way and
she ended up rubbing Seven's arms instead. Embarrassed by what she had done, she
stopped immediately. Seven noticed this and took her arms out around of
B'Elanna's waist and began to rub her arms for her. Surprisingly B'Elanna
didn’t' object, she simply stayed there silent, with her arms wrapped around
herself, while Seven slowly warmed her up. </P>
<P>Seven decided to change positions and moved behind B'Elanna. She pressed her
breasts against B'Elanna's back and began to once again rub B'Elanna's arms.
Seven's legs were on either side of B'Elanna as she wanted to maximize the
amount of body heat B'Elanna received. They stayed this way for another hour,
B'Elanna sitting with her arms around herself, head down, and Seven keeping her
warm. </P>
<P>Unexpectedly, B'Elanna spoke up. "Seven?" She whispered. Seven was brought
out of her dream-like state. "Yes?" She was surprised to hear B'Elanna speak.
</P>
<P>"Thank you." B'Elanna said with sincerity ringing through her voice. </P>
<P>"You are welcome." Seven responded, hoping that B'Elanna could tell how much
she meant it. With that, they continued on like before. Seven returned to her
dream-like state as she massaged B'Elanna's arms, eyes closed, enjoying every
moment of it. </P>

<P>Janeway was sipping some coffee when Tuvok entered her ready room. Janeway
put the coffee down hoping for some good news. "Tell me something I want to hear
Tuvok." Unfortunately Tuvok did not have any good news.</P>
<P>"We have determined that there is a temporal differential between normal
space and the planet Captain." Tuvok stated and waited for a response.</P>
<P>"Again?" Janeway couldn't believe it. "How big is the difference?" Janeway
asked not really wanting to know the answer.</P>
<P>"The ratio is approximately 1:7. For every day that passes on this ship, a
week will have passed for the away team." Tuvok remained calm while the Captain
was now pacing back and forth. </P>
<P>Janeway was extremely upset, because according to that ratio Seven should
have regenerated an hour ago. She tapped her comm badge, "Doctor, my ready room
now!" Janeway made it clear she didn't want any delays. </P>
<P>When the Doctor entered the ready room he expected to be scolded for one or
all of his extra-curricular activities. After all, even Tuvok seemed to glare at
him while he crossed the bridge. But to his surprise Janeway was rather upset
and not in an angry way. She had her head down looking at the table, while her
hand covered her eyes as if she was in deep thought. When she heard the doors
open she immediately looked up.</P>
<P>"Yes Captain, you called?" The Doctor spoke not knowing if the Captain was
going to explode or break down. </P>
<P>The Captain walked up to him and spoke softly. "Tuvok discovered a temporal
differential of 1:7. According to that ratio, Seven would have had to regenerate
an hour ago. How long will she be able to survive without regeneration, our
time?" Janeway definitely didn't want to know the answer to this one.</P>
<P>"I'm not sure Captain, Seven's Borg systems are still somewhat of a mystery
to me. Although I can tell you that she has recently attempted sleeping as
opposed to regenerating in her alcove." The Doctor hoped this would ease some of
the Captain's fears.</P>
<P>The Captain seemed to perk right up. "That's right, she did practice sleeping
recently. Although I must say, she didn't like it very much. Seven said the
covers were most constricting. So I replicated some silk sheets for her."
Janeway said jokingly. </P>
<P>"Captain?" The Doctor was most intrigued by where this conversation was
heading. Janeway realized the Doctor was looking for gossip, so she patted him
on the back and directed him towards the door. "That'll be all Doctor you can
return to sick bay." </P>
<P>He almost lost his mobile emitter as he was hurried through the ready room
doors. </P>
<P>Back on the planet, several hours before the events on Voyager Seven
continued to massage B'Elanna's arms took keep her warm from the now biting
cold. B'Elanna was now shaking rather heavily. She thought back to how this
whole situation had started. Then it hit her, they forgot about Parker. "Oh my
God! Parker!" B'Elanna jumped up from the ground, her legs rather numb from
sitting so long. Seven was surprised to say the least. "We forgot about Parker
Seven, we have to go get her." B'Elanna was so angry at herself that she had
momentarily forgotten about the cold. </P>
<P>Seven got up and placed both hands on B'Elanna's arms to try and still the
frantic half-Klingon. "I have not forgotten about Ensign Parker Lt. Torres."
Seven stated.</P>
<P>B'Elanna grasped Seven under her arms and pulled her closer, nose to nose
now. "What are you talking about Seven, If you didn't forget about her why are
we still here. We should be looking for her now otherwise she's gonna freeze out
there." B'Elanna was looking Seven directly in the eyes trying to drill it into
Seven's brain how dire the situation was. </P>
<P>Seven returned the gaze unflinching. "It is not logical for us to search for
her in this cold weather. It is also night time and there is no artificial
lighting of any kind here." Seven tightened her grip on B'Elanna unconsciously.
B'Elanna knew Seven was right, but she still felt responsible for Ensign
Parker's current predicament. "You don't understand Seven, it's my fault she's
out there. It'll be my fault if she dies." B'Elanna pleaded, hoping to change
Seven's mind. </P>
<P>But before Seven could respond, the half-Klingon had collapsed into her arms
in tears. Surprised, Seven simply held B'Elanna close hoping to comfort the now
very upset Chief Engineer. B'Elanna's teary face was now buried in Seven's ample
bosom. And she was mumbling something incomprehensible. </P>
<P>B'Elanna finally looked up at Seven and placed both hands on either side of
Seven's face. "Claire?" B'Elanna questioned, obviously delirious. Seven was now
confused. The only people on the planet were Lt. Torres, Ensign Parker and
herself. "Claire, who?" Seven questioned back. </P>
<P>B'Elanna seemed not to notice Seven's question. "I can't believe it, you're
alive. You're really alive." B'Elanna then brought Seven's face in for a very
deep kiss. Seven didn't move, she was frozen for the first time in her post Borg
existence. B'Elanna's tongue was exploring Seven's mouth ravenously. Her hands
had gone to Seven's back and were now massaging it over the smooth bio-suit.
When the kiss finally broke, B'Elanna laid her head down on Seven's shoulder and
snuggled her face into the crook of Seven's neck. B'Elanna stood there holding
her lost love.</P>

<P>Seven stood under the starry sky holding B'Elanna in her arms. B'Elanna was
content to stay there for eternity, her face snuggled up against her lover's
neck, only it wasn't really her lover. </P>
<P>Seven had just experienced a sensation she had never known before. When
B'Elanna's tongue massaged her own, she was terrified and delighted at the same
time. Seven's knees grew weak but it was not the bio-electric field causing it,
and she knew that for certain. </P>
<P>Seven attempted to speak but no words would come. She was speechless.
B'Elanna nuzzled in closer and brought one hand up to undo Seven's bun. Blonde
hair fell into B'Elanna's waiting hand. Oh how long she had waited for this
moment, to feel the soft silky hair of her lover. Seven's heartbeat raced and
she struggled to breathe. She tried to make sense of the emotions flooding her
body and mind, but every time she tried to examine one emotion B'Elanna would do
something to bring about a new one. </P>
<P>The Borg was not in control anymore, she had given it up to Lt. Torres.
B'Elanna spoke amid her sobbing. "Why… did… you… leave me?" B'Elanna brought her
closer as if to stake possession of her lover on the lonely planet. </P>
<P>Seven was finally able to speak. "I did not leave you Lt. Torres." She said
in a confused tone. B'Elanna suddenly changed from sobbing to anger as she
brought her eyes up to look Seven in the eyes. "What are talking about you left
me 7 years ago, when you went on that suicide mission that I told you not to go
on." B'Elanna screamed through teary eyes. They were now at arms length,
B'Elanna holding tightly onto Seven's arms as if she was trying to squeeze her
anger into her lover. </P>
<P>"I believe you have mistaken me for someone else Lieutenant." Seven was
finally beginning to understand. She had read some articles on human delusions.
And she believed B'Elanna was experiencing one right now. </P>
<P>"Oh, don't pull that crap on me. I searched for you when everyone else said
you were dead. I searched for you even when I thought you were dead, but I never
stopped trying. Why, because I loved you and I thought you loved me too. Now
you're playing the I don't know who you're talking about crap!" Seven was
stunned. She didn't know how to respond. While Seven contemplated the situation
the grip on her arms grew tighter. </P>
<P>"Is that all you have to say after all we've been through, nothing!" B'Elanna
screamed one last time and released her hold on the blonde Borg. She stalked off
into the cold night air hoping to find some solitude after her heartbreaking
encounter. B'Elanna had dreamt of this moment for 7 long years, never thinking
it would actually come. Now she wished it never had. </P>
<P>Seven watched as B'Elanna slowly disappeared into the night. Then she came to
her senses and followed the delirious half-Klingon. B'Elanna didn't go far, she
had collapsed to the ground in tears, her arms holding her knees close to her
body crying her heartache. Seven stopped some distance from her not knowing what
she should do. </P>
<P>The chill of the night was taking it's toll on B'Elanna once again. Seven
could see her start to shiver. So the Blonde Borg decided to proceed with
caution not wanting to startle the Chief Engineer. Surprisingly, B'Elanna did
not look up as Seven came within a few feet of her. She continued to sob and cry
and rock herself trying to wish away the pain. </P>
<P>Seven's heart went out and instinctively, she reached out and placed her hand
on B'Elanna's shaking shoulder from behind. B'Elanna responded by placing her
own hand over Seven's. The Borg then kneeled down and embraced the sobbing
Lieutenant in her arms, hoping to comfort her and take away her pain. </P>
<P>"It is alright B'Elanna, I am here." Seven whispered softly in Lt. Torres'
right ear. "I will always be here." Seven's hold tightened. B'Elanna responded
by taking Seven's left hand in her right and squeezing it as if to say she
understood. The embrace continued into the night until they both fell asleep in
each others arms. The soft grass was B'Elanna's bed and Seven was her
blanket.</P>

</table>

<P>The cool morning breeze passed over the two sleeping forms on the alien
grass, and the sun began to rise over the horizon. B'Elanna and Seven faced each
other on their sides and held each other in a comforting embrace while they
slept. B'Elanna's face was safely snuggled into the top of Seven's bosom, while
her right leg had managed it's way in between Seven's thighs. </P>
<P>B'Elanna began to stir as the sunlight hit the side of her face. When she
opened her eyes she was staring directly at Seven's beautiful breasts. B'Elanna
pulled back in shock, attempting to extricate her leg in the process. "Ahhh!
What are you doing Seven?" </P>
<P>Seven awoke to a very embarrassed and blushing Chief Engineer. "I was
sleeping, now I am lying on my side." Seven rubbed her eyes, trying to get used
to the morning sunlight. In her alcove on Voyager she always awoke to a glowing
green room, now she awoke to a brilliant sun-soaked planet. </P>
<P>"No, I mean what were you doing to me?" B'Elanna asked not remembering the
events of last night. </P>
<P>"I do not recall doing anything to you Lt. Torres." Seven brushed herself off
while slowly getting up.</P>
<P>"Then what do you call having your arms draped around me like that?" B'Elanna
questioned.</P>
<P>"I was attempting to console you while you were having your paranoid
delusions last night, as well as providing you my body heat to keep you warm."
Seven stated as if it was obvious.</P>
<P>B'Elanna stood up from her kneeling position to match Seven's standing
position. "What?" B'Elanna said shocked and angry. "I was not having paranoid
delusions. And as far as keeping me warm goes, I don't need your help!" B'Elanna
turned and stalked off, but before she could make it very far, Seven's voice
pierced her core. </P>
<P>"Who is Claire?" Seven asked, ignoring the Engineer's current state of anger
and flight.</P>
<P>B'Elanna froze, suddenly taken over by fear. She slowly turned around. "Who?"
B'Elanna asked uneasily.</P>
<P>"Claire. You mentioned her last night during your delusions. I believe she
was a former lover of yours. Is that correct Lt. Torres?" Seven was the curious
Borg once again. </P>
<P>B'Elanna's heart stopped, she couldn't move. Thoughts were racing through her
mind at warp 10, she simply stood there not answering and not moving.</P>
<P>"Lt. Torres?"</P>
<P>Nothing.</P>
<P>"Lt. Torres?" Seven question again as she moved closer to the unmoving
Engineering. "Is there something wrong?" Seven closed the distance between
them.</P>
<P>"I…. I…. I…" Was all B'Elanna could get out. "I what?" Seven continued. "I…
I… think… we should… look for… Ensign Parker." B'Elanna just managed, as she
avoided the question. </P>
<P>"True, but you have yet to answer my question." Seven pushed.</P>
<P>"What question?" B'Elanna was beginning to regain her composure. </P>
<P>"Who is Claire and is she a former lover of yours? Was the question in
question." Seven responded.</P>
<P>"Who?" B'Elanna faked not understanding. Seven realized they were going in
circles and was getting frustrated.</P>
<P>"The woman you referred to in you paranoid delusions last night." Seven
pried. </P>
<P>"Oh, Claire. She was just someone I knew before, nothing important." B'Elanna
said casually. It pained B'Elanna to say that, but she wanted to end the Borg
interrogation as quickly as possible. </P>
<P>"She did not seem unimportant, in fact she seemed very important to you."
Seven was relentless, not knowing why she was so curious, but something inside
her wanted to know about this Claire. </P>
<P>"Well she was!" B'Elanna snapped. "Now, can we get on to looking for our
missing team member or do you want to tell Captain Janeway we lost someone."
B'Elanna was adamant and Seven knew it.</P>
<P>"Very well." Seven was surprised at the anger B'Elanna showed when she pushed
her for an answer. Not that she hadn't seen the Engineer go off before, but this
time was different. Seven had not intentionally tried to anger the Lieutenant.
She was simply curious as to whether or not B'Elanna had a female lover prior to
Tom Paris. </P>
<P>With the exchange over, the two picked up the tricorders and some fruit, then
headed out for the apple patch in silence.</P>

</table>

<P>As the two walked the 2 km distance to the apple patch B'Elanna couldn't help
but steal glances at Seven. The Borg had her hair down and B'Elanna wondered how
that had happened. Most of last night was but a hazy dream to B'Elanna. She had
dreamt that she met her long lost love, but Seven seemed to know a little to
much about her past. B'Elanna figured that she had talked in her sleep and Seven
had overheard. But who has paranoid delusions in their sleep B'Elanna wondered.
In order for someone to have a paranoid delusion, wouldn't they have to be
awake, she thought to herself. "Oh God no!" B'Elanna stopped in her tracks.</P>
<P>Seven as usual was walking ahead efficiently but heard B'Elanna stop, not to
mention the little curse. Seven stopped, turned around and asked "Is there a
problem Lt. Torres?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna had her right hand on her head lightly rubbing her ridges. "What
Seven?" Looking up she saw the Borg standing there hair blowing through the
wind, with a look of concern. "I asked if there was a problem." Seven spoke with
a softness that was slightly familiar to B'Elanna, but she couldn't remember
when she had heard it. Heart pounding, blood racing, B'Elanna was faced with the
possibility that the dream she had last night was not in fact a dream. In fact
it was more than just a possibility she thought as images raced through her mind
in an unending blur. The images grew clearer and came more slowly. But she began
to develop a headache and pressed her right hand to her head tightly and fell to
one knee. As B'Elanna was able to sort the images out a hand suddenly touched
her shoulder. "Are you okay?" The soft heavenly voice reverberated through her
ears as she tried to recognize the person in front of her. </P>
<P>"Claire?" B'Elanna managed to get out through the now piercing headache.
"Ahh!" The headache continued to grow in intensity. And B'Elanna now had both
hands pressing against her head. "Lt. Torres, I am Seven of Nine, what kind of
pain are you experiencing?" Seven had both hands on either shoulder hoping to
get B'Elanna to recognize her. B'Elanna's head tilted upward, the image of
Claire and Seven blended together and switched slowly back and forth. The
headache that so suddenly caused her pain, had slowly began to dissipate as
B'Elanna started to recognize Seven again. "Seven?" B'Elanna said unsure of who
she was looking at. "The Borg cracked a slight smile relieved that B'Elanna had
regained her senses. "Yes, that is correct Lt. Torres, now may you please tell
me what is wrong with you so I may treat you." Seven was genuinely concerned.
</P>
<P>"Oh, just a piercing headache Seven, although it's not piercing anymore
thankfully." B'Elanna said rubbing her eyes." When she opened them again she was
staring right into Seven's beautiful blue eyes. "I am uncertain as to how to
treat a headache Lieutenant. However if you have a dislocated shoulder I will be
glad to pop it back in place for you." Seven teased as she realized B'Elanna was
feeling better. B'Elanna couldn't help but laugh at the joke. Seven simply
smiled in that wonderful way of hers that few ever saw. </P>
<P>B'Elanna's head was now clear, but Seven's eyes were still locked with hers.
"Umm. Thanks for the cheering up Seven, I really needed it. In fact, my
headache's cleared right up." B'Elanna looked down to avoid the blue gaze. "You
are welcome Lieutenant." Seven said appreciatively while still holding onto
B'Elanna's shoulders.</P>
<P>B'Elanna brought her hands up to Seven's shoulders to steady herself and to
help herself stand back up. The soft silkiness of Seven's bio-suit surprised
B'Elanna as her hands unconsciously ran along Seven's shoulders. B'Elanna was
almost lost in the touch before she kicked herself back into reality. The two
stood their with each other's hands on each other's shoulders. B'Elanna once
again kicked back into fantasy as she once again locked eyes with the Beautiful
woman standing before her. For a moment both stood there silently lost in the
stare. B'Elanna's mouth grew dry as she took in the sweet smile of Seven's. She
couldn't help but smile back. The moment seemed perfect. </P>
<P>During the flash of images that ran through her mind during the headache,
B'Elanna was able to put together some of what happened last night. Although
extremely embarrassed by the situation, she realized that Seven wasn't. The kiss
she had shared with Seven continuously played through her mind, sometimes with
Seven as the recipient, sometimes with Claire. But she knew that no matter how
much she wished it was Claire, Seven was the true receiver of her passionate
kiss. </P>
<P>Blushing and finding it hard to breathe, B'Elanna found the courage to
apologize. "About last night Seven, I'm really sorry." B'Elanna found it harder
and harder to maintain eye contact. "What exactly are you apologizing for?"
Seven asked not understanding. </P>
<P>B'Elanna couldn't believe Seven was actually gonna make her say it. But then
again, maybe Seven really didn’t' know what she was apologizing for. "Well, you
know. The… thing that happened." B'Elanna hoped Seven caught on. </P>
<P>"Thing?" Seven crooked an eyebrow.</P>
<P>"Yeah, the thing between us." B'Elanna pushed hoping she wouldn't have to go
into too much detail.</P>
<P>"Between us? Are you referring to when you kissed me or when I had my arms
draped around you as you put it this morning." Seven continued.</P>
<P>B'Elanna started to squirm. "Well I was thinking the former, but both I
guess." B'Elanna seemed a little relieved, although not by much. </P>
<P>"Strange, I did not know one apologized for kissing another person, nor did I
know one apologized for letting someone prevent them from freezing to death."
Seven sounded a little confused.</P>
<P>"Oh, well people usually don't kiss people who don't want to be kissed, so
that's why I apologized. As for the letting you save me from becoming an icicle.
Well, I guess that does sound a little stupid to be apologizing for right?"
B'Elanna dropped her hands from Seven's shoulders now aware of their position,
but as she did so her right hand briefly grazed Seven's breast. "Oh my God I
didn't mean to…" B'Elanna was now truly flustered.</P>
<P>Seven looked down at where B'Elanna's hand had briefly touched her breast. An
odd sensation had washed over her at the moment of contact. The same sensation
that she had felt when holding B'Elanna last night. Seven still held onto
B'Elanna's shoulders, not aware that she was tightening her grip. Staring at her
own breast, Seven finally let go of B'Elanna and touched the spot on her breast
that B'Elanna had so innocently made contact with. </P>
<P>B'Elanna's eyes grew wide at Seven touching her own breast. She couldn't
believe what was happening before her eyes. Mouth dry, no words coming, eyes
glued to the sight before her, B'Elanna was in a state of shock. </P>
<P>"Curious, what does one call this sensation?" Seven asked in her curious Borg
way as she slightly squeezed her breast. B'Elanna's knees were about to buckle,
and there was nothing to hold onto but the woman touching her breast in front of
her. "Ah, well, I, think you should ask the Doctor about that." Oh wait no, she
thought as the words left her mouth. "On the other hand don't say anything about
this to him, please?" B'Elanna pleaded, as she knew the Doctor was a one man
gossip machine. </P>
<P>"Very well, but can you tell me what I am experiencing?" Seven was now
massaging her breast, feelings of pleasure washing through her body. </P>
<P>B'Elanna was quickly looking around, making sure no one was watching. "I
think you should stop doing that before anyone sees." B'Elanna was genuinely
concerned that she would get caught watching Seven touch herself even though
they were basically on an empty planet, save for Ensign Parker. </P>
<P>"Is this not appropriate?" Seven asked. B'Elanna look exasperated. "Well, of
course not. People don't usually touch themselves in front of other people."
B'Elanna whispered to Seven. </P>
<P>"I am sorry, I did not know I was causing you discomfort." Seven removed her
hand from her breast, as it gently bounced back into place. "Is it normal for
people to touch others in front of other people as you did when you touched my
breast." </P>
<P>"That was an accident!" B'Elanna almost screamed. "I was just dropping my
hands and they accidentally grazed, well, you know?" B'Elanna said defensively.
</P>
<P>"I am sorry, I did not mean to accuse you of any inappropriate behavior."
Seven was apologizing far more than she ever had in her brief star fleet career.
</P>
<P>"That's okay, just as long as we forget this whole thing ever happened."
B'Elanna hoped she truly would, but knowing the Borg, that was damn near
impossible. </P>
<P>"As you wish Lieutenant." Seven was familiar with the whole pretending
something never happened thing. As she had caught many crew members performing
inappropriately while on duty. </P>
<P>With that finished, B'Elanna took the lead and continued the 2 km walk
towards the apple patch to look for their missing crew member. She hoped that
leading the way would avoid having to look at the nice slender body swaying back
and forth with blonde hair blowing through the wind. B'Elanna kept telling
herself that she wasn't attracted to Seven, but she knew she was lying. </P>
<P>Seven remained quiet the rest of the way, not wanting to disturb the
obviously flustered Lieutenant.</P>

<P>B'Elanna looked at the drained tricorder hoping to try and get any reading
out of it, but to no avail. The temperature on the planet changed from freezing
cold at night to blazing hot in the afternoon. The two were only a few hours
away from the blazing hot, so they wanted to make good time to the apple patch,
walking very briskly. </P>
<P>As B'Elanna tinkered with the tricorder, Seven silently observed the
Lieutenant. The Borg had always admired the Chief Engineer's determination, but
would never admit it openly. B'Elanna's forehead was now dripping in sweat and
her arms were glistening in the bright sunshine. The half-Klingon had wrapped
her Starfleet jacket around her waist hoping to avoid suffocating under the
constant glare of the sun. B'Elanna ran a hand through her wet hair to give
herself a better view at the blank screen in front of her. As she did that, some
sweat from her forehead fell onto the screen. </P>
<P>"Damn it!" B'Elanna went to wipe it off with back of her arm only to make the
situation worse. Now the whole screen was covered in sweat. After thoroughly
cursing herself at the stupidity of the move, she grabbed one of the sleeves
hanging around her waist and began to wipe the screen dry. Then the obvious
happened, a rock jumped out of nowhere and placed itself in the precarious
position of B'Elanna's path. Stumbling like a fool, B'Elanna cursed some more,
as the tricorder flew from her hand and she tried to protect her face from the
fall. </P>
<P>Seven quickly appeared at B'Elanna's side offering a hand to help her up.
Without saying a word, the two exchanged glances, B'Elanna's one of
embarrassment and anger at herself, Seven's being something that can only be
described as a smirk. </P>
<P>B'Elanna reluctantly took Seven's surprisingly dry hand compared to her own.
The Borg swiftly pulled her up and continued on her way. B'Elanna watched now as
Seven was taking the lead, hips swaying in the sunshine. B'Elanna looked at her
hand, which was now soaked in sweat, and wondered how the Borg managed to stay
dry as ice in this weather. Especially in that very tight bio-suit that she
wore. </P>
<P>B'Elanna found herself mesmerized by the tight outfit and the person in it.
She was in fact staring. Suddenly Seven turned around. "Are you coming?" Seven
cocked an eyebrow and waited for a response. B'Elanna quickly turn her eyes to
the ground. 'Uh, yeah, just have to get the tricorder." B'Elanna was trying her
best impression of 'where did I put that pip?' as she searched for the
tricorder, avoiding all eye contact with the beautiful blonde.</P>
<P>Finally, finding it behind a big boulder, B'Elanna picked it up and started
walking towards the apple patch, head down. Seven, seeing this turned around and
continued on her way.</P>
<P>Silence once again gripped the two as they made their way across the grassy
plains. Not that long after, the two reached the apple patch and began searching
for their missing crew member. </P>
<P>"Okay, I'll take this side of the hill, you take the other." B'Elanna finally
spoke, breaking the silence. </P>
<P>"Very well." Seven said in her usual Borg way. </P>
<P>The two split up, B'Elanna walking right into the apple trees, Seven more or
less checking out the open area of the hill. B'Elanna had given up on the
tricorder and decided to search the old fashioned way. Picking up a small
leafless branch off the ground, B'Elanna started mowing her way through the
leaves and apples while screaming Ensign Parker's name.</P>
<P>Seven, methodically searched the open hill side looking for any sign of the
young Ensign. But she was distracted by B'Elanna's constant yelling. Surely if
Ensign Parker could respond, she would have already. But B'Elanna insisted on
continuing her screaming campaign. This annoyed the Borg to no end. Finally, she
found some sign of the young Ensign, a pile of apples. It was placed on the
opposite side of the hill, protected from the wind last night. But Parker was
nowhere to be found. Now it was Seven's turn to scream.</P>
<P>"Lt. Torres I have found something." Seven shouted in B'Elanna's general
direction. No response. "Lt. Torres?" Again no response. Seven was now worried.
She made a beeline for the trees when B'Elanna suddenly burst out of the leaves
and apples nearly running right into her. "Wow, what's up Seven!" B'Elanna said
backing up a little from the closeness. </P>
<P>"What is up, is that I called your name twice and you did not answer." Seven
said obviously frustrated. "Really? I didn't hear you." B'Elanna said
innocently.</P>
<P>"Maybe if you had spent more time looking rather than shouting you would have
heard me." Seven was now venting in the only way she knew how.</P>
<P>"Okay. That was uncalled for, but we don't have time to argue, so did you
find something?" It was B'Elanna trying to calm the waters for once. Seven's
look of annoyance did not go away, but she decided not to pursue the matter.
"Yes, over on the other side of the hill is a small pile of apples which I
believe was made by Ensign Parker." Seven was now back in Borg efficiency mode.
"That, or a small little bunny rabbit trying to horde all the apples." B'Elanna
joked. Seven did not find that the least bit amusing. B'Elanna knew that her
humor was lost on the Borg, so she simply sighed. "Okay, lead the way." B'Elanna
motioned with her arms. </P>
<P>Seven, turned and walked briskly to the site of the pile. B'Elanna quickly
pulled out her tricorder and attempted to scan the pile looking for any traces
of Parker, then remembered the thing didn’t work. "Sorry, force of habit." She
said to Seven who was staring at her. Dropping the tricorder, she picked up an
apple not exactly sure what she was looking for. After examining the apple,
B'Elanna decided to look for any foot prints or anything that could tell her the
whereabouts of the young Ensign. Okay, either some big animal took her or she
went off looking for some shelter. Either way, I have no idea which direction
she went. </P>
<P>"I find that surprising." Seven responded. "And why exactly do you find that
surprising? I don't see you coming up with anything better." B'Elanna said
defensively. </P>
<P>"It has been my experience that Commander Chakotay tends to talk extensively
on his Native American searching techniques when we are on away missions." Seven
stated. B'Elanna just had to laugh. "I know the feeling, unfortunately I was
always distracted during his searching lectures." B'Elanna laughed. </P>
<P>"Distracted by what." Seven questioned.</P>
<P>"Oh no one, I mean nothing." B'Elanna quickly corrected herself. "Why don't
we just head in the direction of the caves, you said they were over there
right?" B'Elanna pointed, hoping that Seven would drop the subject. Fortunately
for B'Elanna, Seven did not push the subject and simply nodded confirmation.</P>
<P>"Okay, let me just get some apples and we can be on our way." B'Elanna picked
up as many as she could hold and fit into the jacket around her waist, then
headed for the caves with a very annoyed Borg.</P>
<P>Seven meanwhile, was thinking about B'Elanna's slip of the tongue, and what
exactly it had meant. </P>

<P>Tuvok walked into Captain Janeway's ready-room looking like the cool
confident Vulcan that he was. No matter how hard Janeway tried, she could never
tell if the Vulcan had good news or bad. So she did the next best thing, hope
for good news. Janeway looked up from her computer screen and asked "Anything
good?" She was actually pleading for good news, something she didn't do
often.</P>
<P>Tuvok simply answered, "This does not seem particularly good or bad, but I
will let you decide. It seems that the temporal distortion is unstable and is
constantly changing." Tuvok clasped his hands behind his back.</P>
<P>"What do you mean it's changing?" Kathryn stood up.</P>
<P>"The ratio has changed from that of 1:7, to that of only 1:2. One may
interpret that as good, on the other hand we have no way of knowing if that
ratio will change to something worse." Tuvok hoped the Captain would take this
as a good sign. But in all his experience with humans, they always seemed to
look at the negative rather than the positive, well everyone except for Captain
Janeway.</P>
<P>"If it does, then we'll just have to deal with it. Right now, our best bet is
to try and find a way to set up the Delta Flyer to withstand the bio-electric
field emanating from that planet. If only we had our Chief Engineer to help us,
or our resident Borg for that matter, but I had to push Seven into going on that
away mission, stupid me." Janeway scolded herself, in front of a very
uncomfortable Vulcan. </P>
<P>"I believe placing the blame on yourself will only make matters worse, you
should be concentrating on the Delta-Flyer, after all, you still have Lt.
Paris." Tuvok couldn't believe he had actually said that, after all he thought
Paris was mostly annoying.</P>
<P>"You're right, Paris practically built the Flyer by himself. If anyone should
know how to equip a force field to protect it, it would be him." Janeway patted
Tuvok on the shoulder and walked out of her ready-room and onto the bridge.</P>
<P>Tuvok wanted to say that it was him who did most of the work, while Paris
simply tried to make it look cool. But he decided to let Paris have his moment,
ironically without him being there.</P>
<P>Down on the planet sun was glaring red hot and B'Elanna was on the verge of
collapse. "How much longer to the Caves, I think I'm gonna pass out if we don't
make it there soon." B'Elanna was panting, trying to hold on to the last of her
apples while biting into a new one.</P>
<P>"We would already be there if you did not insist on bringing the entire
orchard of apples." Seven chastised.</P>
<P>"Very funny Seven, but they're a great source of water, and in this sun we
need all we can get. Want one?" B'Elanna offered her one of her remaining four
uneaten apples. </P>
<P>"I do not require nutrition at this time." The Borg seemed peeved.</P>
<P>"Well, you did miss your regeneration cycle right, so I think you do need
it." B'Elanna pushed the already annoyed Borg.</P>
<P>"There are more pressing matters, such as the whereabouts of our missing
crewman. I do not have time to eat." Seven pushed back.</P>
<P>"You'll be more efficient on a half-full stomach then on an empty one I'll
bet. Come on Seven, I promise I won't yell at you like I did before." B'Elanna
walked right up to the beautiful blonde and held it in front of her body.</P>
<P>"Very well, I will eat it, but we must continue on our way. We have already
wasted too much time arguing over this matter." Seven snatched the apple and
began walking towards the caves, not looking back.</P>
<P>"Great, not even a thank you." B'Elanna muttered to herself as she watched
the Borg turn around and pick up the pace.</P>
<P>Seven's hair was still undone and flowing in the bountiful sunshine that
rained down upon the planet. And B'Elanna couldn't take her eyes off of it. She
realized that it was her that had undid Seven's hair during one of her
flashbacks. </P>
<P>She was stunned at the resemblance that Seven and Claire shared. Although
Commander Chakotay would probably argue that she thought all blondes looked like
Claire. The Commander was one of the few members on board Voyager that knew
about her love affair with Claire and the heartache that she had suffered when
she disappeared. </P>
<P>In fact it was so bad that there was an unspoken rule never to speak about it
to anyone. Even Chakotay was scared to bring up the subject, so he never did.
</P>
<P>It was a chance encounter really, B'Elanna thought to herself. B'Elanna was
on a Maquis mission on Earth gathering information on Federation movements near
the Cardassian border. Chakotay wanted to make sure they didn't run into any
Starfleet vessels on their missions.</P>
<P>B'Elanna happened to run into her while she was trying to hack into the
Federation's database. Well, more precisely, Claire caught her in the act and
was going to report her to the authorities. But B'Elanna had other plans, she
knocked Claire out with a quick fist to the face and carried her to a nearby
hotel where she was to meet up with her Maquis team. </P>
<P>Whenever someone asked about the unconscious woman in her arms, B'Elanna just
said that she had fainted and she was taking her to the hospital. Surprisingly
people just nodded okay and went on their way.</P>
<P>The heat of the sunshine was really getting to B'Elanna as she had fully
drifted off to her past. Now she was the one who fainted and Seven had to pick
her up and carry her the rest of the way. Seven placed her hand on B'Elanna's
forehead to check her temperature. Worried, Seven hurried as fast as she could
towards the caves.</P>
<P>B'Elanna entered her hotel room with the unconscious woman draped over her
right shoulder. She was glad when she hit the bed and could get rid of the dead
weight. Now she was left wondering what she was going to tell her Maquis friends
when they found an unconscious woman on her bed. A beautiful one at that. </P>
<P>But she really had no choice. When the woman threatened to tell the
authorities, B'Elanna just panicked and did what she knew best, hit people. So
here she was left with very few options. Kill the woman, or tell Chakotay that
they had a hostage. She really didn't like either option. Chakotay hated taking
human hostages, especially Starfleet ones. So B'Elanna simply paced around the
room cursing at her stupidity at being caught. About an hour after the punch,
the woman started to regain consciousness. This freaked out the half-blooded
Klingon even more. Although she thought it best if she played the calm, cool and
collected kidnapper. </P>
<P>So when the woman finally woke up, B'Elanna was Miss Shadowy figure with no
relevant information to give. </P>
<P>"Where am I and what do you want with me?" The groggy woman demanded an
answer.</P>
<P>"It seems you already know the answer to that question." B'Elanna responded,
trying to confuse the young woman.</P>
<P>"What? Which one, the where or the what?" Claire had a concussion and didn't
understand anything that was happening. </P>
<P>"Both." </P>
<P>"What are you talking about. The last thing I remember is someone putting a
fist to my face." Claire was now panicking and breathing heavily.</P>
<P>"Umm yeah, sorry for that. But you threatened to tell the authorities about
me so I had to put a stop to that." B'Elanna tried to sound cold and
uncaring.</P>
<P>"What, why would I do that? I'd only do that if you were doing something
wrong. But I can't remember anything except the punch. Please let me go, I'm no
use to you." Claire pleaded.</P>
<P>Hmm. B'Elanna thought to herself. If she really didn't remember anything but
the punch then she could just release her and Chakotay would never learn about
her screw up. On the other hand if she was just lying to save her skin, B'Elanna
would probably end up in a cell somewhere being interrogated about the Maquis.
</P>
<P>"You expect me to believe that, I'm half-Klingon, not stupid." B'Elanna
retorted while crossing her arms to look at the blonde lying on her bed.</P>
<P>She was slightly taller than B'Elanna and had a body to die for. In fact
B'Elanna was extremely jealous of her for that, and that was part of the reason
for the fisticuffs earlier on. Well, one fist actually.</P>
<P>"I'm sorry, but I don't want to die. I know what you people do to prisoners."
Claire exasperated, afraid for her life.</P>
<P>"And what exactly do we people do to prisoners?" B'Elanna questioned
sarcastically, already knowing the answer.</P>
<P>"Well, you interrogate them for information, then kill them after you get
what you want." Claire seemed more than happy to answer.</P>
<P>"So that's what Starfleet's been telling you. I'll bet they also tell you
that we eat children and do all sorts of other nasty things for no reason at
all." </P>
<P>"Pretty much, except for the children eating part. So what's your point?"
Claire countered.</P>
<P>"My point is that they're all lies and you bought it, hook, line and sinker."
B'Elanna laughed.</P>
<P>"What's so funny about believing that a terrorist group like the Maquis
doesn't care about killing innocent civilians in order to get what they want."
</P>
<P>"For one thing, we don't kill innocent civilians, we kill Cardassians, and
they can all go to hell as far as I'm concerned. Secondly, you live on Earth,
where everything's all nice and safe. I, on the hand, like a lot of other people
live near the damn Cardassians who wouldn't mind if all humans were
exterminated. Well, everyone except the woman, they'd probably use them as
'comfort woman.' As they like to put it. </P>
<P>"I'm sorry you feel that way, but we have a treaty with the Cardassians now.
And that treaty's been put in jeopardy because you insist on killing them
without provocation." Claire argued.</P>
<P>"Provocation, what do you know about provocation. You sit here on Earth never
knowing what really goes on out there. You sit here listening to reports about
us killing Cardassians, but do you ever hear about what they do to us. Of course
not, because that would jeopardize the treaty you have. So don't tell me about
provocation." B'Elanna was steaming, she didn't realize how much until she saw
she was only a few feet away from the woman lying on the bed.</P>
<P>"Are you saying that the Federation purposely neglects telling us about
Cardassian crimes, because they don't want us fight back?" Claire said
skeptically.</P>
<P>"Exactly. They're afraid that if you hear the truth, then their precious
little treaty will go up in smoke. And their probably right, because enough of
us know the truth and are doing something about it." B'Elanna was now sitting on
the side of the bed, trying her hardest to convince this woman of the truth.
Although she didn't know why she cared so much.</P>
<P>"I find that hard to believe. My father is a Starfleet Captain, and if anyone
would know what it's like out there he would. Why would he lie to me?" Claire
argued while lightly touching the bruise around her left eye.</P>
<P>"He's a father, and all fathers want to protect their daughters from what
they think will hurt them. Well most fathers, or so I've heard." B'Elanna had
brought up something she wanted to forget, her dad leaving when she was still a
child. B'Elanna looked down now, hurt at what she just brought up.</P>
<P>Claire noticed this, and placed her right hand on B'Elanna's shoulder trying
to comfort the woman who had blackened her eye.</P>
<P>"What are you doing?" B'Elanna shrugged Claire's hand off of her
shoulder.</P>
<P>"I'm sorry, I just saw you were hurting and..." Claire trailed off.</P>
<P>"I don't need a shoulder to cry on if that's what you're thinking." </P>
<P>"I never said you did."</P>
<P>"Good." B'Elanna looked into the woman's eyes. "So what's you're name?"</P>

<P>Seven looked over the grassy plains and managed to make out a rocky area in
the distance. Carrying the now half-conscious Chief Engineer across her arms,
she made her way as fast as she could. Sweat now dripping from her forehead and
hands as well made it difficult for her to keep a good grip on Lt. Torres. Not
even her Borg enhanced systems were able to keep her cool in this heat for long,
especially since she missed her last regeneration cycle. </P>
<P>B'Elanna shifted position and started moaning incoherently while Seven tried
to keep from dropping her. "Lt. Torres, please stop moving or I will drop you."
Seven stated to the restless half-Klingon. </P>
<P>But B'Elanna continued to struggle attempting to get free. Finally, Seven
stopped and put the struggling Engineer on the ground. Quickly unwrapping
B'Elanna's Starfleet jacket from around her waist, she tied B'Elanna's hands
together in a tight knot. Then picking her up without saying a word she held
B'Elanna's legs together tightly against her chest. B'Elanna continued to
squirm, but this time to no avail. Seven looked down across her arms, pleased
that B'Elanna was now restrained from causing any more trouble while she headed
towards the caves. </P>
<P>Not too long after, Seven managed to climb some rocks to a safe little cave
entrance protected from the searing heat of the sun. Placing B'Elanna on the
amazingly soft cave floor, Seven untied her hands and began searching the rest
of the cave. </P>
<P>Hearing a dripping sound somewhere deeper into the caves, Seven followed it
hoping to find some water. Seven made her way slowly, making sure not to stumble
on any jagged rocks. Finally coming upon the source of the dripping sound, Seven
was relieved to find that some water was trickling down from the top of the
cave, well more like gushing. The water hit the cave floor and went streaming
out under one of the cave walls, while some sunlight shone down making the water
glisten. </P>
<P>So Seven cupped her hands together to gather the falling water and began to
drink. She was surprised at how thirsty she was. Seven began to drink ravenously
and revelled in the cool taste as it travelled down her throat. She loved it so
much that she decided to step under the waterfall and ended up drenched in the
cool water. Running her hands through her hair, she tried to tie her hair back
into a bun, but it was too wet. Not that she had much experience tying it
anyway, it was the Doctor that assisted her that department. Although she was
Borg, she was not very good at doing her own hair. </P>
<P>Her thoughts went back to when she and the Doctor had picked out the
hairstyle that she would wear. The Doctor had shown her many different styles
worn by the woman on board Voyager, and some that were not. Seven secretly
admired B'Elanna's soft smooth hair style, but decided that the most efficient
would be a bun. In fact, when B'Elanna changed her hair to a curly hairstyle,
Seven secretly detested it and wanted to say something. But of course that was
never relevant. </P>
<P>Quickly her thoughts turned to the half-conscious Lieutenant that was lying
near the entrance of the caves. Worried, Seven walked briskly back the way she
came. Finding B'Elanna unmoving, Seven tried to wake her. "Lt. Torres, are you
awake?" Seven cupped the back of B'Elanna's head. "Lt. Torres, please respond."
Seven waited several anxious moments before she got what she was waiting for.
</P>
<P>"Mmmm, yeah, kinda." B'Elanna managed to trickle out while holding her
forehead.</P>
<P>"That is fortunate, for I thought that you had passed out again. I have found
a small waterfall deeper into the caves, you may want to get a drink and cool
down." Seven suggested, relieved that B'Elanna was okay.</P>
<P>"Is that what you were doing? You're all wet Seven." B'Elanna managed to
chuckle. In all her years, she had never imagined the Borg being soaked in
water.</P>
<P>"Yes. It was relaxing." Seven said embarrassed.</P>
<P>"I'll bet, now help me up so I can get soaked." B'Elanna said humorously.</P>
<P>"Aye, Aye Captain." Seven joked. They simply stared at each other and
smiled.</P>
<P>Seven wrapped her right arm around B'Elanna's back and under her arm, and
placed B'Elanna's left arm around her neck. Half carrying the exhausted
Lieutenant, the two made their way towards the waterfall.</P>
<P>Turning the corner, B'Elanna was in awe at the beauty of the waterfall and
the light that cascaded down along with it. "Wow." Was all B'Elanna could
say.</P>
<P>"Wow, what?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"It's beautiful, that's what." B'Elanna said while letting go of Seven and
making her way for the water. At first B'Elanna simply let her hand under it, as
if testing to see if it was really there. Then she let the water fall on her arm
and watched as it flowed down to the ground. Cupping her hands together she
splashed the water onto her face, rather than drinking it. </P>
<P>Seven watched the water cascade off of B'Elanna's body in wonder. Suddenly
she found it hard to breathe.</P>
<P>B'Elanna finally took the final step into the waterfall and let it crash down
over her entire body, relishing every moment of it. Cupping her hands together
once more, she took a long satisfying drink, lost in the wonderfully cool
feeling that was washing over her. </P>
<P>Seven stared in awe as B'Elanna turned around to face her. "Thank you,
Seven." B'Elanna smiled.</P>
<P>"You are welcome." Seven swallowed.</P>
<P>"Aren't you going to have a drink?" B'Elanna asked holding her cupped hands
forward.</P>
<P>"I... have already drank enough." Seven exhaled.</P>
<P>"Suit yourself, but you never know when this thing will dry up." B'Elanna
took another long drink.</P>
<P>Seven noticed that B'Elanna's nipples had hardened under her grey tank-top,
and this caused her knees to weaken tremendously.</P>
<P>In a shaky voice Seven managed to squeak out, "I will head back to the
entrance and search the other caves for Ensign Parker."</P>
<P>"Okay, I'll do the same once I'm done." B'Elanna watched as Seven more or
less stumbled her way around the corner of the cave. Turning around, B'Elanna
let the water rain down on her face. </P>
<P>Seven managed to make it around the corner without making a complete fool of
herself. She held onto a rock for support, thinking there was something
seriously wrong with her. Her breathing was faster than normal, her heartbeat
was racing, and her temperature seemed at an all time high, not to mention loss
of balance. </P>
<P>Seven's curiosity got the best of her when she settled herself down. She
peeked around the corner of the cave and began to watch B'Elanna bathe under the
streaming water. This time though, watching from behind a large boulder, safe
from B'Elanna's eyes.</P>

<P>B'Elanna cherished the cold water on her skin after being in the hot sun. But
she knew it wasn't too long until the heat became biting cold. This planet liked
to serve up the best of both worlds. </P>
<P>B'Elanna's thoughts drifted off to the last time she had taken a water
shower. It was with Claire. The two fooled around on a secret island Maquis
Outpost near the Cardassian Border. The planet was small, and held a very small
human/Cardassian population. Amazingly, the Cardassians left the planet alone,
figuring it was best to deny the existence of impure Cardassians. B'Elanna and
Claire found a beautiful waterfall on the side of a majestic cliff. Claire
insisted on taking a small dip in the lake it produced. B'Elanna was reluctant,
but couldn't say no to Claire when she gave her the puppy dog eyes. </P>
<P>"Ah, come on B'Elanna. Just a small dip, I promise." Claire pouted.</P>
<P>"You always promise, then we end up getting into trouble." B'Elanna
whispered.</P>
<P>"What are you afraid of, we're alone out here. I checked today's duty roster,
no one's supposed to be around any time soon." Claire countered.</P>
<P>"How convenient for us. And how exactly did we manage to bump into this
waterfall with a nice little lake out here in the middle of nowhere?" B'Elanna
asked.</P>
<P>"Let's just say we didn't bump into it as much as you were led here." Claire
smiled mischievously while slowly backing into the lake.</P>
<P>"Oh really, and I suppose it's just a coincidence we're the only ones out
here today." B'Elanna followed Claire into the lake.</P>
<P>"Must be luck, or maybe the person in charge thought it would be nice if we
got a little alone time." Claire smiled seductively while slipping out of her
now wet T-shirt.</P>
<P>"Could be, seeing that you're the one in charge of the duty roster." B'Elanna
slipped her T-shirt over her head and advanced upon her lover. Wading through
the water B'Elanna's breathing quickened. The half-Klingon could almost feel
Claire's soft skin against her own.</P>
<P>"I see you decided to play." Claire teased as she dived under the water and
left B'Elanna hungering for more.</P>
<P>"Oh I'm ready to play alright." B'Elanna growled. Diving under the crystal
clear water she tried her best to find her prey.</P>
<P>After 30 seconds of holding her breath, B'Elanna resurfaced hoping to find
Claire above the water.</P>
<P>"Where are you?" B'Elanna shouted urgently. She looked from side to side
hoping to catch a glimpse of her lover. Claire knew she wasn't much of a swimmer
and loved to exploit that. </P>
<P>Thinking she saw something in the distance, B'Elanna squinted her eyes hoping
to catch some blonde hair glinting in the sunshine, or maybe even some skin.
Then a splashing sound from behind B'Elanna nearly knocked her out of her
non-existent boots.</P>
<P>Before she could turn around, Claire cupped both of B'Elanna's eyes with her
hands. "Guess who?" Claire teased.</P>
<P>"I don't know, maybe the person that's going to die in a few seconds."
B'Elanna joked, grabbing Claire's hands and bringing them to her mouth. B'Elanna
savoured the taste of the cool clean water on Claire's hands while licking at
them seductively.</P>
<P>Taking one of Claire's fingers, she slowly licked in from base to tip before
taking it into her mouth. Sucking on it like a precious gift, B'Elanna turned
around to find that Claire had slipped out of her shorts as well. This only made
the hungry half-Klingon hungrier.</P>
<P>Now taking two fingers into her mouth, she began to slowly massage Claire's
left breast. Claire moaned lightly in response. Sliding Claire's fingers out of
her mouth and kissing the tips, B'Elanna moved onto her lover's neck.</P>
<P>B'Elanna urgently kissed Claire's neck up and down until she came to her
mouth, which she claimed passionately. B'Elanna attempted to explore Claire with
her tongue, but Claire wouldn't allow access. It was one of their little games
which B'Elanna enjoyed playing. </P>
<P>The point of the game, B'Elanna had to make Claire moan wildly before she
would grant access to her mouth. Not one for wasting time B'Elanna moved her
mouth to Claire's left breast, the one she was still massaging with her
hand.</P>
<P>Seven watched the half-Klingon slip out of her grey tank top and black pants.
Seven wasn't sure if she was doing the right thing by watching B'Elanna strip
naked, but something inside her couldn't resist this opportunity. It was the
proverbial forbidden fruit, and Seven wanted it.</P>
<P>It amazed Seven when B'Elanna closed her eyes and began massaging her own
breasts slowly, softly moaning. She could only assume B'Elanna was enjoying
herself. This brought back the memory of what happened earlier, when B'Elanna
had accidentally touched her breast. She imagined how much B'Elanna must be
enjoying herself, much as she had when she touched her own breast.</P>
<P>Unable to resist, Seven brought her left hand to her left breast and began
massaging it. The sensation almost overwhelmed her. Seven gasped and could feel
her nipple harden under the soft caress. B'Elanna used both hands to kneed and
massage her breasts. Seven decided to do the same. Seven watched B'Elanna tease
her nipples and drop to her knees shuddering. She realised her bio-suit
prevented her from experiencing the same sensation. So she reached behind her
neck and unzipped it. The wet suit clung to her skin as she pulled it down
across her waist, exposing the most beautiful site in the delta quadrant. </P>
<P>Seven's breasts bounced gently as they slipped out from under the tight suit.
Her hands immediately began caressing them again. This time more urgent and
satisfying. Seven could feel every touch and electrical impulse that shot
through her body. Moaning and breathing heavily, Seven watched B'Elanna bring
her right hand down between her thighs. The half-Klingon was now facing her,
feet spread and knees together. Seven made sure B'Elanna's eyes were closed
before continuing. </P>
<P>The breathtaking site almost drew Seven in, but she fought against it.
Recalling B'Elanna's reaction to Seven holding her at night. The blonde borg
didn't want to take any chances to ruin this perfect moment. B'Elanna slid her
right hand up and down her sex, now dripping with honey, while her left hand
continued to tease her left breast. The slick surface allowed easy entry as
B'Elanna's finger slipped inside. She arched her back in sync with the
penetration. "Ahhhhhhhhh!" B'Elanna's scream echoed off the cave walls. </P>
<P>Hearing this brought Seven to the brink. She quickly tensed and let out her
own scream. "Mmmm, Yesssssssss!" Seven's body shook violently for the first
orgasm of her life. The feeling was much better than anything she had ever read.
Although some of the holo-deck programs Captain Janeway suggested were quite
interesting. Seven only watched, rather than participated. She recalled how
Kathryn had told her that they were a 'secret' collection, and under no
circumstances was she to tell anyone else on the ship about them. Now, Seven
knew why the Captain kept them. The feeling wasn't a want, it was a need. </P>
<P>When the wave of the climax settled down, Seven looked to see if B'Elanna had
heard her cry, but B'Elanna simply continued to pleasure herself. Relieved,
Seven continued to watch. B'Elanna moved two fingers in and out of herself,
while using her thumb to rub her swollen clit. Then B'Elanna's tongue licked the
side of her lips seductively as if to invite Seven over. </P>
<P>This alarmed the half-Borg, thinking she had been discovered. Seven's heart
raced at the prospect of being considered a 'peeping tom.' She had heard the
phrase many times, describing mostly Tom Paris and some of the other male crew
members. Luckily, B'Elanna's eyes were closed and she was completely unaware of
Seven's presence. But Seven didn't want to take any chances. So she took one
last look at the bathing beauty and reluctantly left. Slowly slipping her
bio-suit back on, Seven realised she still needed relief. So the blonde Borg
headed back to the cave entrance, hoping to find another abandoned cave to
finish what she started. </P>
<P>Seven's ears pounded with the sound of B'Elanna's passionate cries. This only
served to quicken Seven's pace, because she was afraid she'd change her mind and
go back. </P>
<P>But two words from B'Elanna's mouth stopped her cold, "Oh, Claire!" The
scream was undeniable, and Seven's heart dropped. </P>
