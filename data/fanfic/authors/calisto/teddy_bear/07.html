<P>Janeway was sipping some coffee when Tuvok entered her ready room. Janeway
put the coffee down hoping for some good news. "Tell me something I want to hear
Tuvok." Unfortunately Tuvok did not have any good news.</P>
<P>"We have determined that there is a temporal differential between normal
space and the planet Captain." Tuvok stated and waited for a response.</P>
<P>"Again?" Janeway couldn't believe it. "How big is the difference?" Janeway
asked not really wanting to know the answer.</P>
<P>"The ratio is approximately 1:7. For every day that passes on this ship, a
week will have passed for the away team." Tuvok remained calm while the Captain
was now pacing back and forth. </P>
<P>Janeway was extremely upset, because according to that ratio Seven should
have regenerated an hour ago. She tapped her comm badge, "Doctor, my ready room
now!" Janeway made it clear she didn't want any delays. </P>
<P>When the Doctor entered the ready room he expected to be scolded for one or
all of his extra-curricular activities. After all, even Tuvok seemed to glare at
him while he crossed the bridge. But to his surprise Janeway was rather upset
and not in an angry way. She had her head down looking at the table, while her
hand covered her eyes as if she was in deep thought. When she heard the doors
open she immediately looked up.</P>
<P>"Yes Captain, you called?" The Doctor spoke not knowing if the Captain was
going to explode or break down. </P>
<P>The Captain walked up to him and spoke softly. "Tuvok discovered a temporal
differential of 1:7. According to that ratio, Seven would have had to regenerate
an hour ago. How long will she be able to survive without regeneration, our
time?" Janeway definitely didn't want to know the answer to this one.</P>
<P>"I'm not sure Captain, Seven's Borg systems are still somewhat of a mystery
to me. Although I can tell you that she has recently attempted sleeping as
opposed to regenerating in her alcove." The Doctor hoped this would ease some of
the Captain's fears.</P>
<P>The Captain seemed to perk right up. "That's right, she did practice sleeping
recently. Although I must say, she didn't like it very much. Seven said the
covers were most constricting. So I replicated some silk sheets for her."
Janeway said jokingly. </P>
<P>"Captain?" The Doctor was most intrigued by where this conversation was
heading. Janeway realized the Doctor was looking for gossip, so she patted him
on the back and directed him towards the door. "That'll be all Doctor you can
return to sick bay." </P>
<P>He almost lost his mobile emitter as he was hurried through the ready room
doors. </P>
<P>Back on the planet, several hours before the events on Voyager Seven
continued to massage B'Elanna's arms took keep her warm from the now biting
cold. B'Elanna was now shaking rather heavily. She thought back to how this
whole situation had started. Then it hit her, they forgot about Parker. "Oh my
God! Parker!" B'Elanna jumped up from the ground, her legs rather numb from
sitting so long. Seven was surprised to say the least. "We forgot about Parker
Seven, we have to go get her." B'Elanna was so angry at herself that she had
momentarily forgotten about the cold. </P>
<P>Seven got up and placed both hands on B'Elanna's arms to try and still the
frantic half-Klingon. "I have not forgotten about Ensign Parker Lt. Torres."
Seven stated.</P>
<P>B'Elanna grasped Seven under her arms and pulled her closer, nose to nose
now. "What are you talking about Seven, If you didn't forget about her why are
we still here. We should be looking for her now otherwise she's gonna freeze out
there." B'Elanna was looking Seven directly in the eyes trying to drill it into
Seven's brain how dire the situation was. </P>
<P>Seven returned the gaze unflinching. "It is not logical for us to search for
her in this cold weather. It is also night time and there is no artificial
lighting of any kind here." Seven tightened her grip on B'Elanna unconsciously.
B'Elanna knew Seven was right, but she still felt responsible for Ensign
Parker's current predicament. "You don't understand Seven, it's my fault she's
out there. It'll be my fault if she dies." B'Elanna pleaded, hoping to change
Seven's mind. </P>
<P>But before Seven could respond, the half-Klingon had collapsed into her arms
in tears. Surprised, Seven simply held B'Elanna close hoping to comfort the now
very upset Chief Engineer. B'Elanna's teary face was now buried in Seven's ample
bosom. And she was mumbling something incomprehensible. </P>
<P>B'Elanna finally looked up at Seven and placed both hands on either side of
Seven's face. "Claire?" B'Elanna questioned, obviously delirious. Seven was now
confused. The only people on the planet were Lt. Torres, Ensign Parker and
herself. "Claire, who?" Seven questioned back. </P>
<P>B'Elanna seemed not to notice Seven's question. "I can't believe it, you're
alive. You're really alive." B'Elanna then brought Seven's face in for a very
deep kiss. Seven didn't move, she was frozen for the first time in her post Borg
existence. B'Elanna's tongue was exploring Seven's mouth ravenously. Her hands
had gone to Seven's back and were now massaging it over the smooth bio-suit.
When the kiss finally broke, B'Elanna laid her head down on Seven's shoulder and
snuggled her face into the crook of Seven's neck. B'Elanna stood there holding
her lost love.</P>
