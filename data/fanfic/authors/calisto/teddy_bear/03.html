<P>"What's this?" Janeway asked Seven as she removed the silk panties wrapped
around Seven's shoulder and lifted it high in the air.</P>
<P>The young Borg froze, seeing the anger in the Captain's eyes. She felt
trapped in the tiny room alone with the Captain. The only way out was up the
ladder and onto the main floor of the Delta Flyer. </P>
<P>"Umm. Those appear to be a woman's undergarment," Seven responded as casually
as possible.</P>
<P>"I know that. But whose undergarments are these?"</P>
<P>Seven cleared her throat, attempting to buy time. "Well, when we were down on
the planet, we did not have sufficient medical supplies, so it was suggested
that I use my underwear to wrap my wound."</P>
<P>"These are yours?" Janeway asked suspiciously.</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven lied.</P>
<P>"I didn't know you wore underwear."</P>
<P>"Neither did I," Seven mumbled to herself.</P>
<P>"What was that?"</P>
<P>"Nothing. I was just clearing my throat."</P>
<P>Janeway eyed Seven from the corner of her eye while going to get the dermal
regenerator. Seven shifted around on the medical table, uncomfortable of the
Captain's gaze. </P>
<P>For some reason Janeway felt Seven was being dishonest, but the Borg had not
lied to her since her very first days on the ship. So there was no reason to
doubt her honesty now. But then again, jealously had a way of making people
paranoid.</P>
<P>"Does that hurt?" Janeway asked Seven, while applying the dermal regenerator
to the Borg's left shoulder.</P>
<P>"Are dermal regenerators suppose to hurt?" Seven responded quirking an
eyebrow.</P>
<P>"No. Stupid question. I just wanted to break the tension."</P>
<P>"Consider it broken."</P>
<P>Janeway smiled at the response and pulled the dermal regenerator away. </P>
<P>"There, should be as good as new," Janeway said, smoothly running her hand
along the newly regenerated skin. </P>
<P>Seven held her breath at the contact and almost let her right hand slip from
covering her chest.</P>
<P>"Thank you," Seven replied, turning around in her seat and quickly pulling up
her bio-suit. </P>
<P>"Here, let me help you with that," Janeway said, placing both her hands on
Seven's bare shoulders before the Borg could finish covering them.</P>
<P>"Very well," Seven complied hesitantly.</P>
<P>Janeway softly let her hands drift from the top of Seven's shoulders, down
along Seven's back to where the zipper was. Ever so slowly, Janeway pulled the
zipper up, covering Seven's skin. At the base of Seven's neck, the Captain
softly brushed away Seven's hair and finished zipping her up.</P>
<P>"All done," Janeway said, patting Seven on the back.</P>
<P>"Thank you Captain."</P>
<P>Seven stood up, turned around to face Janeway, and took a step back.</P>
<P>"I believe we should head up and assist B'Ella…Lt. Torres and Ensign Parker
in flying the Delta Flyer."</P>
<P>Seven swallowed.</P>
<P>Janeway furrowed her brow, looked at Seven and finally responded, "Very
well."</P>
<P>Seven immediately turned and headed for the ladder.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"So the ship went from burning to brand new in a matter of hours?" B'Elanna
asked unbelievingly.</P>
<P>"Yup," Ensign Parker answered.</P>
<P>"Wow. So I guess Seven and I weren't hallucinating then?"</P>
<P>"Why? What happened to you two?" Parker asked eagerly.</P>
<P>"Oh," B'Elanna blushed, thinking about the passionate lovemaking, the
waterfall, and her declaration of love, "Nothing much."</P>
<P>"But you just said you thought you were hallucinating."</P>
<P>"Yeah. I did, didn't I? Well, a basket did appear out of thin air."</P>
<P>"Really?"</P>
<P>"Yup. And I guess that about…" B'Elanna stopped as she saw Seven climbing up
the ladder and onto the main floor.</P>
<P>"About what?" Seven asked, wondering why B'Elanna was staring at her
strangely.</P>
<P>Parker looked back and forth between Lt. Torres and Seven of Nine. Torres
flinched and looked down to ground. In all her years aboard Voyager, Parker had
never ever seen Lt. Torres look down when talking to anyone.</P>
<P>"I… Huh?" B'Elanna asked, forgetting the original question as she looked up
and fell into Seven's deep blue eyes.</P>
<P>"You were saying 'I guess that about,' and then you stopped," Seven
replied.</P>
<P>"Oh yeah, I was just telling Ensign Parker here about the magical basket that
appeared out of nowhere, that's all."</P>
<P>"I see," Seven said casually.</P>
<P>"Hey," Parker whispered conspiratorially to Seven, "Maybe you can fill me in
on all the details that Lt. Torres here isn't telling me?"</P>
<P>Seven quirked an eyebrow and B'Elanna almost jumped out of her seat.</P>
<P>"No!" B'Elanna shouted abruptly.</P>
<P>"No, what?" Janeway asked while popping up from the lower deck.</P>
<P>"No," B'Elanna hesitated momentarily, "We should stop talking and start
heading back to Voyager."</P>
<P>"Good idea," Janeway said sarcastically, "I'm surprised our Chief Engineer
didn't think of that sooner.</P>
<P>B'Elanna could feel the bite in Janeway's statement as she walked up and sat
down next to her at the main console.</P>
<P>"So," Janeway clasped her hands, inverted them and stretched them out, "Are
we going to begin any time soon?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna swallowed hard, "Yes Captain."</P>
<P>"Good, because I wouldn't want to interrupt your chit-chat."</P>
<P>B'Elanna bit down on her lower lip and proceeded to launch.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Communications are still down Captain," Seven stated from the secondary
console.</P>
<P>"Don't worry about it, we'll be back on Voyager soon enough," Janeway
answered.</P>
<P>B'Elanna remained unusually quiet as she piloted the ship back to Voyager.
Although quiet, she remained focused on every word that passed between the
Captain and Seven.</P>
<P>"So," Janeway leaned back in her chair, "I was thinking you could join me on
the holo-deck and relax after you've regenerated?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna clenched her left hand under the console. Seven, surprised at the
offer, hesitated a moment when she noticed B'Elanna stiffen.</P>
<P>"I believe that would be unwise Captain," Seven answered smoothly.</P>
<P>"Oh?" Janeway turned in her seat at the unexpected response. "Why's
that?"</P>
<P>"I believe that I should re-assimilate myself to my regular work schedule.
After being gone so long I think routine should be my priority."</P>
<P>B'Elanna smirked as Seven brushed Janeway off, but was unsure as to whether
Seven was serious to going back to her routine on Voyager. Would she forget
everything that happened on the planet? Would she just brush that off as a
momentary lapse in judgement because of the extenuating circumstances? B'Elanna
wondered painfully throughout the rest of the flight.</P>
<P>"Very well," Janeway replied, extremely embarrassed at being rejected and
even more irritated at B'Elanna's smirk.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The docking bay doors opened and the entire senior staff greeted them, but
the Doctor and Tom were front and centre, fighting for position.</P>
<P>After seeing that no one was seriously injured, Tom playfully nudged the
Doctor aside, "Looks like you won't be needed here Doc," Tom said as he held his
right hand behind his back.</P>
<P>"Tom," B'Elanna said, noticing his strange behaviour.</P>
<P>"Well," Tom smiled and spread his left arm wide to his side, "Aren'tcha gonna
give me a hug?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna eyed him suspiciously, "What's your right arm doing behind your
back?"</P>
<P>Seven stared at Tom as well, "Yes Lt. Paris, what are you hiding?" Seven
questioned from behind B'Elanna.</P>
<P>"Nice to see you again too Seven."</P>
<P>The Captain's faced glowed with excitement as if a cloud had just lifted.
Down on the planet she had completely forgotten about what Tom told her before
her leaving. Now it had all returned and she couldn't be happier.</P>
<P>"Tom," Janeway threw her arm around his shoulders, "Has a very big
announcement to make."</P>
<P>Janeway looked directly into B'Elanna's eyes and grinned.</P>
<P>"Well," Tom smiled, "If you aren't going to give me that hug, then I guess
there's only one thing left for me to do?" </P>
<P>Tom got down on one knee and pulled the box out from behind his back.
B'Elanna froze, Seven stiffened, and Janeway clasped her hands together. </P>
<P>Using his left hand, Tom opened up the box, exposing the beautiful diamond
ring inside, "B'Elanna Torres, will you marry me?" Tom asked, his face full of
sincerity.</P>
<P>For some reason B'Elanna had expected a long-winded speech about how she had
changed his life, how she was everything to him, how he couldn't live without
her, but he had skipped all of that and just popped the question. </P>
<P>Looking at Tom's face, looking at the faces of Harry, the Doc, Tuvok,
Chakotay, and Neelix, B'Elanna felt more pressure than she'd ever felt in her
entire life. </P>
<P>Seven, meanwhile, stood stiffly several feet behind B'Elanna, her heart
beating rapidly, her breathing completely slowed, and the pressure in her head
on the verge of exploding.</P>
<P>"I..." B'Elanna hesitated while looking at the eager faces of her friends,
"I..." B'Elanna looked at Tom's pleading, hopeful, and sincere face, "I..."
B'Elanna felt all her feelings for Tom re-surface, all the times they'd spent on
the holo-deck, all the times they'd eaten dinner, and all the times they'd spent
breaking Starfleet regulations, "Sure," B'Elanna finally answered, a wave of
guilt crashing down on her.</P>
<P>"Well that doesn't exactly sound like a resounding yes," Harry joked while
the rest of the senior staff laughed, "But I'm sure he'll take it."</P>
<P>Tom furrowed his brow, as he took B'Elanna's hand, slipping the ring on her
finger.</P>
<P>Seven quickly walked by, her body slightly brushing up against B'Elanna's, as
she headed down the corridor to somewhere that wasn't there.</P>
<P>"I guess some people just can't handle the emotional roller-coaster of
proposals," Harry laughed as Seven left.</P>
<P>"Speaking of which, I think I'll be leaving," Tuvok stated, "Congratulations
Lt. Torres and Paris, may you two live long and prosper."</P>
<P>B'Elanna simply nodded, tears filling her eyes, and kept her head down, not
wanting to see Seven's departing form.</P>

<P>Tuvok secretly walked down the corridor to holo-deck 2, hoping no one would
notice him taking advantage of his holo-deck time. As he prepared to enter
holo-deck 2, the doors remained closed. </P>
<P>"Computer, is holo-deck 2 occupied at the moment?" Tuvok questioned.</P>
<P>"Yes, holo-deck 2 is currently occupied by Seven of Nine."</P>
<P>Tuvok tapped his Comm badge, "Lt. Tuvok to Seven of Nine."</P>
<P>No response.</P>
<P>Tuvok quirked an eyebrow, "Computer, what program is Seven of Nine currently
running?"</P>
<P>"The program that Seven of Nine is currently running is unknown."</P>
<P>"Curious. Computer, how long has Seven of Nine been running this
program?"</P>
<P>"Seven of Nine has been running this program for exactly one hour, fifteen
minutes, and forty-two seconds."</P>
<P>"Has she been allotted any extra holo-deck time since returning to
Voyager?"</P>
<P>"No. Seven of Nine is currently occupying Lt. Tuvok's allotted holo-deck
time."</P>
<P>Tuvok furrowed his brow in curiosity and slight annoyance. Ever since Lt.
Paris re-created his wife to cure his ponn farr problem, Tuvok had been
efficiently using up all of his allotted holo-deck time.</P>
<P>"Computer, open the door to holo-deck 2."</P>
<P>"Access to holo-deck 2 is denied."</P>
<P>Tuvok walked up to the holo-deck panel and attempted to override the
restrictions, but found that Seven had used Borg encryption codes to deny
access. Realising that he wasn't going to get passed the Borg encryption codes,
he contacted the only person that could.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B'Elanna had just finished convincing Tom that they should spend the night in
separate quarters, so as to give her some time to recuperate. Tom had insisted
that she stay the night, but she had insisted even harder that she needed a
sonic shower and some sleep. Of course he offered to help, but she said she
wasn't in the mood. After a long quiet meal, quiet in so far as he talked, and
she listened, B'Elanna wasn't feeling up to the message she was about to
receive.</P>
<P>"Tuvok to Lt. Torres."</P>
<P>B'Elanna tapped her Comm badge and answered, "Lt. Torres here. What's up
Tuvok?"</P>
<P>"What is up, is that Seven of Nine has locked herself inside of holo-deck 2
using Borg encryption codes."</P>
<P>B'Elanna felt her guilt double in that one instant, only now realising how
much she had truly hurt Seven. B'Elanna quickly dropped the stuffed Targ that
Tom gave her; supposedly to be Toby's sister, and immediately headed to
holo-deck 2.</P>
<P>"I'm on my way Tuvok."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Approaching holo-deck 2, B'Elanna noticed Tuvok standing quietly outside the
door. </P>
<P>"So, not even going to try to break the Borg encryption codes are ya
Tuvok?"</P>
<P>"It would not be an efficient use of time."</P>
<P>"But standing here in the corridor waiting for me, is?"</P>
<P>Tuvok furrowed his brow while B'Elanna began work on the panel.</P>
<P>"Don't worry Tuvok, I got this covered. I'll inform you when I'm done."</P>
<P>"Very well."</P>
<P>Tuvok turned and left, not wanting her to wonder about why he was here in the
first place.</P>
<P>As the Vulcan left, B'Elanna took the panel covering off and began the real
work of deciphering the Borg encryption. Her mind raced with the time she had
secretly spent studying Seven's Borg encryption codes. She had recorded every
instance in which Seven had used them and had studied them thoroughly. The
thought of actually breaking one of her codes and seeing the look on Seven's
face had driven her for months. It had become a hobby of her's when the tension
between them was at a maximum, but after they came to an understanding, she had
more or less given up on the codes. </P>
<P>Now she was trying to break Seven's Borg encryption for an entirely different
reason, not to see the look of irritation and anger on Seven's face, but to
simply see her face, period. As B'Elanna hit dead end upon dead end of code, her
mind flashed between what had happened on the planet and what was happening now.
All the time she had spent studying Seven's codes seemed useless, as she grew
more and more frustrated at her inability to crack it. But part of her didn't
want to crack the codes. Part of her wanted to go on, never knowing what had
taken place down on the planet. Never knowing the possibility of loving someone
so much that it killed her inside to lose them. Never loving someone so much, as
much as she loved Claire. Here she was, half-Klingon, and she was afraid of
something so arbitrary, but she knew it wasn't arbitrary, it was love and
sometimes it hurt more than anything else in the world. </P>
<P>As B'Elanna's thoughts went back and forth for some time, she had somehow
gotten through most of the barriers in Seven's codes. It surprisingly came down
to only one word, one four-letter word. Bear.</P>

<P>As the archway disappeared, B'Elanna found herself in a familiar setting; the
sun setting, the breeze cool, and her and Seven lying together on the grass.</P>
<P>Seven had her arm wrapped possessively around the holo-B'Elanna. She had
fallen asleep, content to stay in this make-believe world forever.</P>
<P>B'Elanna noticed that every detail was just as it was on the planet, even
down to Seven's injured arm. </P>
<P>"Computer," B'Elanna choked back a tear, "delete character Lt. B'Elanna
Torres and re-lock holo-deck 2 with Seven's Borg encryption codes."</P>
<P>The holo-B'Elanna vanished along with her Starfleet jacket that was covering
the both of them. Seven immediately began to notice the missing presence and
began reaching out for the holo-B'Elanna. B'Elanna took off her jacket and
covered Seven with it. Lying down next to Seven, she allowed Seven's arms to
encircle her, calming the young Borg down.</P>
<P>Noticing her Comm badge still on her jacket, B'Elanna grabbed it, opened it
up and deactivated it.</P>
<P>"Sorry Tuvok, your wife's gonna have to wait another day," B'Elanna whispered
to herself as she slipped the ring off her finger, tucked it away inside the
Comm badge, set it aside on the ground, and snuggled up to Seven.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"Tuvok to Lt. Torres."</P>
<P>Tuvok waited anxiously for a response in his quarters, but none came.</P>
<P>"Tuvok to Lt. Torres, are you alright?"</P>
<P>Still no response.</P>
<P>"Computer, locate Lt. Torres."</P>
<P>"Lt. Torres is in holo-deck 2."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Janeway entered cargo bay 2, after a couple hours of pacing around in her
quarters, only to find Seven not regenerating. </P>
<P>"Janeway to Seven Nine."</P>
<P>No response.</P>
<P>"Computer, locate Seven of Nine."</P>
<P>"Seven of Nine is in holo-deck 2."</P>
<P>Janeway turned and headed out of cargo bay 2, but she was stopped by Tuvok's
voice.</P>
<P>"Tuvok to Captain Janeway."</P>
<P>"Captain Janeway here. What's the problem?"</P>
<P>"It's interesting that you assume there is always a problem when I contact
you."</P>
<P>"Well, isn't there?"</P>
<P>"Fair enough. I believe we have a problem involving Lt. Torres and Seven of
Nine."</P>
<P>"What kind of problem?"</P>
<P>"It appears that Seven of Nine has locked herself and Lt. Torres inside of
holo-deck 2."</P>
<P>"You mean B'Elanna's in there alone with Seven?"</P>
<P>"Yes. Shall I assemble the security team?"</P>
<P>"Yes, immediately. Have them meet us outside the holo-deck."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Janeway approached holo-deck 2, where Tuvok and his security team had been
waiting, "What's the situation?" Janeway asked in mid-stride.</P>
<P>Tuvok answered promptly, "Holo-deck 2 is restricted with Borg encryption
codes and when we tried to de-activate them, a force field was immediately
erected around the entire area."</P>
<P>"So you can't beam them out?"</P>
<P>"We cannot. Ensign Kim is currently working on a way to circumvent the force
field.</P>
<P>"How soon can he get a lock?"</P>
<P>"Unknown. It's curious Captain."</P>
<P>"What's curious?"</P>
<P>"When I asked Lt. Torres to deactivate the Borg encryption codes, a force
field never went up. It's as if Seven of Nine wanted Lt. Torres to break
through."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Seven stirred restlessly, which caused B'Elanna to wrap her arms even more
tightly around the young Borg.</P>
<P>"Shhh, it's okay Seven," B'Elanna whispered while softly caressing Seven's
holo-graphically injured left shoulder, "It's okay, I'm here."</P>
<P>Upon hearing those words, Seven calmed down. Although she was still asleep,
she could still feel B'Elanna's presence.</P>
<P>B'Elanna had stayed awake and watched the sun set, watching it cast an
orange, red, and finally purple light along Seven's skin. The feeling of melting
into Seven's body almost made her lose consciousness, but she fought to remain
awake, so she could be there when Seven awoke. </P>
<P>The starry sky and partial moon gave B'Elanna all the light she needed to
make out the soft curves of Seven's face, shoulder, and body.</P>
<P>Over and over, B'Elanna ran through what she was going to say, when she was
going to say it, and how she was going to say it. Every word was critical, every
nuance was critical, because right now, everything was critical. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"I'm getting tired of this," Janeway said while pacing back and forth outside
the holo-deck door, "Tuvok, have your team blast their way through this damn
force field, now!"</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B'Elanna kissed Seven's forehead as she awoke, causing Seven to reciprocate
with a kiss on the lips.</P>
<P>"I love you," B'Elanna whispered.</P>
<P>"I love you too," Seven murmured into B'Elanna's shoulder, "Please don't
leave me?" Seven pleaded desperately, while pulling B'Elanna closer.</P>
<P>B'Elanna could feel the guilt resurfacing and taking control of her body.</P>
<P>"I won't," B'Elanna said while kissing the top of Seven's head, "I
promise."</P>
<P>Seven smiled at the reassurance and snuggled closer, pushing B'Elanna's body
back slightly. Seven's left hand brushed up against a cool metallic object.
Curious, Seven took the object in her hand and brought it around B'Elanna's
body.</P>
<P>"What's this?" Seven asked while looking at the dismantled Comm badge.</P>
<P>"I didn't want us to be disturbed," B'Elanna said while softly brushing a
strand of hair from Seven's face.</P>
<P>Seven opened up the Comm badge and saw the shining engagement ring. Finally
coming to the realization that this was not the holo-B'Elanna, Seven pulled back
from B'Elanna's touch.</P>
<P>"You should not be here."</P>
<P>B'Elanna tried looking Seven in the eyes, but the young Borg would not look
up.</P>
<P>"Seven," B'Elanna reached out to touch her on the shoulder, but Seven pulled
back even further.</P>
<P>"No," Seven shook her head, "I do not want you here."</P>
<P>"If you didn't want me here, why'd you make the password so easy to
guess?"</P>
<P>Seven remained silent while rolling the ring around in her hand.</P>
<P>"I'm sorry Seven. I never meant to hurt you. I just didn't want to break
Tom's heart, that's all."</P>
<P>Seven looked up and dropped the engagement ring, "So instead you decided to
break my heart."</P>
<P>"That's not what I meant Seven."</P>
<P>"Then why did you accept Lt. Paris' proposal?"</P>
<P>"Because I was afraid."</P>
<P>"Afraid of what?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna took a deep breath, "I was afraid of losing you."</P>
<P>"That does not make sense," Seven shook her head. "The very act of accepting
his proposal made you lose me," Seven said while standing up. "Computer, end
program."</P>
<P>The yellow grid and black walls of the holo-deck replaced the light of the
stars and moon. The dismantled Comm badge and engagement ring stood out along
the black floor by Seven's foot.</P>
<P>Seven began walking towards the door when B'Elanna grabbed her by the arm,
"Seven, wait."</P>
<P>Seven looked directly into B'Elanna's eyes, "I believe I have waited long
enough," Seven said while pulling her arm away, turning, and walking towards the
door. "Computer, deactivate Borg encryption codes." </P>
<P>Suddenly phaser fire could be heard bouncing off the holo-deck doors,
followed quickly by Janeway ordering a cease-fire. Then the doors opened and in
rushed Janeway.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The brig was a place B'Elanna thought she'd never see again. It was cramp, it
was quiet, but worst of all, it was lonely, especially since Janeway ordered
that she be kept in solitary confinement. Not even Neelix could see her, and he
was usually pretty good at getting around the Captain's orders. So she sat down
on the rock-hard bed, propped her knees up to her chin, and closed her eyes.
</P>
<P>Next thing B'Elanna knew she was back in her quarters, standing next to the
door.</P>
<P>"Well it's a fine mess you've gotten yourself into now. Isn't it, Bella?" Q
said while lying on his stomach on B'Elanna's bed.</P>
<P>"Q?" B'Elanna turned her head and saw Q completely clad in a red Captain's
uniform, pips and all. "What the hell are you doing here?"</P>
<P>Q snapped his fingers and suddenly appeared standing right in front of
B'Elanna, "Oh, I think you know exactly why I'm here."</P>

<P>B'Elanna crossed her arms and avoided eye contact, "I don't know what you're
talking about Q."</P>
<P>"Really," Q stepped even closer and looked down, his face only inches from
B'Elanna's. "So you're saying you thought everything that happened on the planet
was natural?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna swallowed hard, "Yes."</P>
<P>"Well then, if you're so sure then there's no need for me now, is there?" Q
said while slowly motioning for another snap of his omnipotent fingers.</P>
<P>"Wait." B'Elanna uncrossed her arms and looked directly into Q's mischievous
eyes, "Why?"</P>
<P>Q wrapped his left arm around B'Elanna's shoulders, "Well, technically you
should be asking Q that," Q motioned towards B'Elanna's bed, snapped his
fingers, and in a blink a baby boy dressed in pink angel wings, pink angel
shoes, and a pink heart-shaped bow-and-arrow appeared on her bed. "Or should I
say Qpid?" </P>
<P>Q smiled and squeezed B'Elanna's shoulders.</P>
<P>"What?" </P>
<P>"Oh don't tell me you've never heard of him?" </P>
<P>Q snapped his fingers and appeared on the bed with the baby on his lap.</P>
<P>"If you're talking about Cupid, then yes I've heard of him, but he's not
real."</P>
<P>"Of course he's not real, or at least he wasn't, at least not until now. You
see, one day my son and I…"</P>
<P>"That's your son," B'Elanna blurted out.</P>
<P>"I know, can you see the resemblance?" Q pinched the baby's cheeks.</P>
<P>"Sure," B'Elanna said rolling her eyes.</P>
<P>"Like I was saying, one day my son and I were gallivanting around the galaxy
looking for something interesting to do, when we came upon this planet. Sad
really," Q shook his head in mock concern, "You see, the inhabitants had been at
war for two millennia divided into two distinct factions, same species,
different beliefs. If we had never come along, they were going to be at war for
another five millennia until one of the factions was completely
annihilated."</P>
<P>"So you created a peace treaty between them?"</P>
<P>"Hardly. A Q would never do something so drab as that, but my little boy
decided to put a spell on the prince of one faction and the princess of the
other faction so they'd fall in love."</P>
<P>"So they ended up making peace because of it?"<BR><BR>"Well actually, no.
They ended up destroying each other within a year."</P>
<P>"You destroyed an entire civilisation because you wanted to have a little
fun?"</P>
<P>"Don't be so hard on the boy," Q said while covering his son's ears. "It's
not his fault that his powers aren't up to Q standards as of yet, but they're
getting there." </P>
<P>B'Elanna exhaled in disbelief.</P>
<P>"Now, now Bella. I didn't come here to upset you."</P>
<P>"Then why did you come here?"</P>
<P>"To correct a mistake."<BR><BR>"A mistake?"<BR><BR>"Yes, a tragic mistake
really." Q shook his head. "You and that Borg Drone. What's her name again?" Q
feigned ignorance.<BR><BR>"Her name's Seven and she's not a drone."</P>
<P>"Yes, so I've heard, but anyway, you two were never meant to be."</P>
<P>"What?"</P>
<P>"Oh, how can I explain this in terms a half-Klingon can understand? You see,
my boy here thought that putting you and that Blonde Bombshell together would be
a good thing, but it turns out you two are completely wrong for each other."</P>
<P>"I'm not listening to this," B'Elanna said while walking towards the
bathroom.</P>
<P>"Why? Are you afraid of the truth?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna stopped, turned, and looked directly into Q's eyes, "The only truth
I know, is that you're beginning to bug the hell out of me."</P>
<P>Q grabbed his chest, "I'm hurt, really, I am. Here I am trying to help you
and you decide I'm just an annoyance."</P>
<P>"Because you are."</P>
<P>"Am I? Or are you just denying the real truth? The truth that if it wasn't
for my boy here, you and that automaton would have never fallen in love?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna remained silent, her head racing with the possibility that Q's son
was the only reason that she and Seven had fallen for each other, that none of
this was real, that her feelings were fake, and that Seven's feelings were fake
as well.</P>
<P>"I know it's a tough pill for you mortals to swallow, but it's true, you just
don't belong with Seven. Seven belongs with Kathy."</P>
<P>"What?" B'Elanna shouted, snapping out of her daze. </P>
<P>"Oh, as if you didn't know that already. My little Kathy's perfect for her,
isn't that right boy?" Q said while playing with his boy's hands. "What?" Q
tilted his head as if trying to hear his non-talking son better, "You think
Bella here's better for drone-girl." Q shook his head in disapproval. "Well, he
is his mother's son."</P>
<P>B'Elanna held back a curse at Q's obvious attempt to goad her. </P>
<P>"Let me guess, that's your way of saying your son put a spell on me and Seven
down on the planet."</P>
<P>"I can only wish. At least that way the spell would have worn off eventually,
but my son learned from his last mistake and decided to try something
different."<BR><BR>"And what was that?"</P>
<P>"He pulled the old 'lock a couple of mice in a cage and watch them mate'
routine."</P>
<P>B'Elanna laughed at the absurdity of the statement, "You expect me to believe
that all Seven and I had was just some animal sex?"</P>
<P>"Oh, but wasn't it?" Q snapped his fingers and his son disappeared, letting Q
stand upright again. "The two of you were isolated alone on the planet by my
son, and left with some apple trees, a cave and a waterfall, and you two ended
up coupling like two targs in lust. Which I must say, isn't pretty."</P>
<P>"It was more than that," B'Elanna said weakly, her eyes downcast.</P>
<P>"You don't sound very convinced?" Q stepped closer to B'Elanna, sensing her
anguish.</P>
<P>"I don't have to prove anything to you Q?"</P>
<P>"True, but you do have to prove it to yourself, don't you?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna kept her eyes down, not wanting to look the ever-closer Q in the
eyes.</P>
<P>"Can it be?" Q taunted, "I broke the half-Klingon already, how sad."</P>
<P>"You didn't break anything Q. In fact, I think you fixed it."<BR><BR>"Oh?" Q
lifted an eyebrow.</P>
<P>"When I was down there on the planet with Seven, I felt something that I
haven't felt in a long time."<BR><BR>"Let me guess, you felt love. Isn't that
sweet?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna ignored Q's teasing. "Yes, I did feel love, but I also felt like I
had finally let go. I felt like I had finally let go of Claire, and accepted her
death, and that I should move on and find love again."</P>
<P>"Isn't that what you did with Tommy Boy?"</P>
<P>"That's what I thought, but it wasn't the same. He was safe, someone I could
care about without fearing the worst."</P>
<P>"That's rather cold of you don't you think?"</P>
<P>"I know, but it's the truth. I never wanted to go through the pain of losing
someone I cared so much about again.</P>
<P>"Are you sure you lost her?"<BR><BR>B'Elanna's head snapped up. "What are you
talking about?" </P>
<P>Q calmly walked over to the table in the middle of the room, sat down, and
casually crossed his legs. "What if I told you, you haven't lost her?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna stomped over to Q and pounded a fist on the table, "You son of a
bitch."</P>
<P>"What?" Q shrugged his shoulders innocently.</P>
<P>"You want the Captain and Seven together so badly that you would lie about
Claire being alive?"</P>
<P>"Oh, this has nothing to do with the Captain."</P>
<P>"Then why are you doing this?"</P>
<P>"Like I said, I was trying to fix a mistake my son made."</P>
<P>"He obviously doesn't think it's a mistake, so why do you?"</P>
<P>"If I told you that, I would break the temporal prime directive and I most
definitely don't want do that. It would cost me my pips, see."</P>
<P>Q pulled out his collar and lightly tapped his pips with a finger.</P>
<P>"So what? Janeway throws me in the brig a couple hundred more times for
dating Seven? I can deal with that."</P>
<P>"Silly Klingon, you have no idea what's ahead."<BR><BR>"So tell me."</P>
<P>"Believe me, I would like to, but the continuum has rules."</P>
<P>"So these rules allow you to meddle in our affairs and change timelines, but
you can't tell me why I'm not supposed to be with Seven?"</P>
<P>"If I told you, you wouldn't believe me."</P>
<P>"You're probably right, but can you at least tell me this? Were you lying
when you said Claire's still alive?"</P>
<P>"I never actually said it, you just inferred it from my ambiguous
statement."<BR><BR>"Fine, then was my inference correct?"</P>
<P>"Possibly, but do you really want to know?" Are you willing to give up the
chance to be with someone right now, for the slim chance of finding a lost love
decades from now?"</P>
<P>"So she's still alive?"<BR><BR>"Once again, I never said that. I just asked
you a simple question, do you really want to know?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna mulled the question over in her brain, trying to think about what
she would do if Claire was alive, if she would be willing to sacrifice a
relationship with Seven for the remote possibility of being with Claire, and if
she could go on living, knowing she had a chance to find out once and for all if
Claire had died, only to give it up due to cowardice.</P>
<P>Q waited impatiently, tapping his fingers on the table.</P>
<P>B'Elanna licked her dry lips and finally answered, "Yes, I have to know."</P>
<P>"Then yes, she is."</P>
<P>B'Elanna's heart dropped. Although she was elated to know that Claire was
still alive, she was now faced with an impossible decision. Her first love or
her new love, but she had some doubts as to Q's motive and honesty.</P>
<P>"Why did you tell me?"<BR><BR>"Because I thought you deserved to know as
much."</P>
<P>"Won't telling me break one of your rules?"</P>
<P>"Actually, since your decision would have been the same whether or not you
knew, it doesn't change a thing."</P>
<P>"And what decision is that?"</P>
<P>"You tell me?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna recalled how she and Claire had made love under the suns of Ishtar,
how they had slept in each other's arms under the starry sky of Earth, how
Claire had proposed to her with the messenger bear, how they had kissed each
other goodbye just before Claire went on that suicide mission, how she had
mourned her loss for years, not wanting to believe she had died, how everyone,
including Chakotay, told her to let go, that it wasn't worth it anymore, and
here she was faced with the fact that Claire was still alive, still waiting for
her somewhere in the galaxy.</P>
<P>Then B'Elanna recalled the time she had spent with Seven down on the planet,
how Seven had protected her from the cold by wrapping her arms around her, how
Seven was injured and she had taken care of her, how they had made love for the
first time under that waterfall, how they had spent the night curled up in each
other's arms as the sun set, how they had awakened to the most beautiful sunrise
in recorded history, how they had declared their love for one another, and how
Seven was her teddy bear. </P>
<P>The tears began to well up in B'Elanna's eyes as she remembered the look of
pain in Seven's eyes in the holo-deck and how guilty she felt at accepting Tom's
proposal, knowing that it would break Seven's heart.</P>
<P>Remembering the joy in Seven's eyes when she said 'I love you,' for the first
time, was something B'Elanna wanted to see again. </P>
<P>"The answer's Seven, Q." B'Elanna said contentedly.</P>
<P>"Very well, but you still haven't proven that you love her, or are worthy or
her love."</P>
<P>"I don't have to prove anything to you Q."</P>
<P>"Of course you don't. Like I said before, you have to prove it to yourself.
What can you possibly give her that no one else can?" </P>
<P>B'Elanna licked her dry lips, somewhat stunned at the question. The
half-Klingon racked her brain for an answer that would put Q in his place. </P>
<P>"I would die for her," B'Elanna said proudly.</P>
<P>Q laughed lightly, "So would half the people on this ship, including Chuckles
and not to mention my dear Kathy."</P>
<P>B'Elanna scrunched her nose, annoyed that Q had just bested her. </P>
<P>"What can you," Q began again, "A half-breed, not even a full human, possibly
give a Borg drone?"</P>
<P>"That's it," B'Elanna said confidently.</P>
<P>"What's it?"</P>
<P>"We're both half-human."</P>
<P>"Well then, that just makes you two a perfect match. Oh wait, Hairball and
Kathy are both 100% human, then I guess they too must be a perfect match," Q
said sarcastically.</P>
<P>"That's not what I meant. I meant that because we're both half-human, I could
help her deal with not being accepted by others, especially when we get back
home."</P>
<P>"That's a little presumptuous of you isn't it? What makes you think you'll
all make it home? And even if you do, don't you think the holographic projection
would be a far better teacher in that category? After all, the ball of light
won't stop complaining about how oppressed he is."</P>
<P>"True, but the Doctor isn't human and Seven can't love him."</P>
<P>"Okay, fine, how about Kathy? She's done a fine job helping her become
half-human. What makes you think she can't help her become fully human
again?"</P>
<P>"I don't know," B'Elanna said softly.</P>
<P>"That's a first. You actually admitted you don't know something."</P>
<P>"Well what am I suppose to say Q? Everything I say you put down as being
trivial or make it seem like it doesn't matter. I say I love her and you say
prove it, I say I would die for her and you say big deal, I say I can help her
with the transition to becoming human and you say so can Janeway. Tell me Q,
what do you want me to say?"</P>
<P>"I don't want you to say anything? It's all up to you. You don't have to
answer the question, but in doing so, you admit defeat and that you are not
worthy of her love. So the choice is yours Bella, what can you give her that no
one else can?"</P>
<P>Q snapped his fingers and B'Elanna ended up in the softest chair she'd ever
been in, but that was the furthest thing from her mind. Right now, she had to
answer this question, not for Q's sake, she could care less about what Q wanted,
but for herself. B'Elanna put her hand to her forehead and closed her eyes,
concentrating, running through everything she had, everything she could do, her
skills, her strengths, and even her weaknesses. Maybe it wasn't something that
she could give Seven, but something that Seven could give her. She thought about
that possibly long and hard, but gave up, figuring Q would just laugh it off as
avoiding the question. </P>
<P>As B'Elanna sat quietly in the pink fluffy chair that Q had made for her, the
omnipotent being sat quietly as well, amazingly patient this time. </P>
<P>B'Elanna thought about her engineering skills, about her experiences as a
child, about her Klingon heritage, about her human heritage, about her Maquis
days, about her first love, and about everything that was uniquely her. Then she
knew. It was her. It was as simple as that. It wasn't one thing, it was
everything. The thing that she could give Seven that nobody else could, was her.
</P>
<P>"It's me," B'Elanna said, opening her eyes to see a satisfied grin on Q's
face.</P>
<P>"Congratulations," Q clapped his hands together, "You finally figured it out.
It's a shame really, I've asked that very question over a thousand times in my
entire existence, and only one other person has ever given me that answer.
People go though their lives thinking that the most important thing they can
give is to die a valiant death, or to buy the most expensive gift, or to bore
their lover to death with their past experiences, or anything else that is
singular. The fact is, the one thing that someone can give that no one else can,
is them and everything that goes with them. Their strengths, their flaws; it's
the whole package. It's just too bad that only two people in the galaxy know
that."</P>
<P>"I can't believe I'm actually going to say this, but thank you Q."</P>
<P>"Don't thank me yet, but you can thank me for this."</P>
<P>Q snapped his fingers and a white envelope appeared in B'Elanna's hands.</P>
<P>"What's this?" B'Elanna asked while trying to open the envelope.</P>
<P>"Oh, you can't open it."</P>
<P>"Then what's the point?"</P>
<P>"It'll open by itself when it's ready. Just keep it around until it does.
Just for your information, holding it up to a light won't help either, neither
will any of your ship's sensors."</P>
<P>"Thanks for the warning, I was going to spend a whole five seconds trying to
pry it open."</P>
<P>Q smiled at the sarcasm, he really liked her spunk, but it's not as if he'd
ever tell her that. "Well, if there's no more questions to be asked and answers
to be given, then my work here is done. Although I don't think Kathy will like
the results very much, but I guess I could hook her up with Hairball or
Chuckles."</P>
<P>"Wait a minute Q. When you said that only one other person gave the answer I
did, who was it?"</P>
<P>Q looked at her with a gleam in his eye, "Oh I think you know the answer to
that." </P>
<P>And then he was gone, leaving a smiling B'Elanna back in the brig and the
envelope he gave her on the pink fluffy chair that was still in her room.</P>

</table>

<P>The first person to greet B'Elanna when she was let out of the Brig was Tom.
He had roses in one hand and a bottle of wine in the other. B'Elanna had a
feeling he would do that and it made it that much harder to tell him what she
had to say. </P>
<P>Back at her quarters, Tom found the Stuffed Targ he had given B'Elanna lying
on the ground and picked it up. </P>
<P>"What are you doing on the floor?" Tom asked the stuffed animal and then
looked up to see B'Elanna over by a pink chair.</P>
<P>"When did you get that?" Tom asked.</P>
<P>"What?" B'Elanna responded, pre-occupied with the envelope that was on the
chair in question.</P>
<P>"The chair, I've never seen it before."</P>
<P>"Oh, it was a gift."</P>
<P>"A gift?" Tom said laughingly. "By who? The bad taste fairy?"</P>
<P>"You could say that," B'Elanna said, half-smiling.</P>
<P>She then sat down on the pink chair and held the mysterious envelope in her
lap, her eyes downcast.</P>
<P>"Tom, I think you should sit down."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>"If it wasn't for my son Q deactivating the fail-safe device in your head,
you'd never have fallen in love with that Klingon in the first place," Seven
heard again and again in her head as she walked down the corridor.</P>
<P>That thought was quickly followed by the Captain trying to seduce her in the
Mess Hall. The Captain had arranged for the Mess Hall to be empty with candles
surrounding the table in the centre of the room. She had also insisted that the
young Borg call her Kathryn. The combination of wine, candle light and perfume
had made her nauseous. Fortunately she was able to thwart the Captain's advances
by implying that her away mission had left her too tired to eat.</P>
<P>Seven's thoughts then jumped to the end of the conversation with Q where he
had congratulated her on her answer and had given her an envelope. He had said
that it would open by itself at the appropriate time, but it had been a week,
and the darn thing still hadn't opened. Of course, she also hadn't seen B'Elanna
in a week, nor had she even talked to her. Every time she thought she had the
courage to tap her Comm Badge and contact B'Elanna, she had chickened out and
contacted somebody else. Harry, Chakotay, Tuvok and the Doctor, were beginning
to get annoyed at her non-speaking after contacting them.</P>
<P>Seven continued down the corridor, partially out-of-breath from visiting
Engineering, again and again and again, only she never walked through the door.
It had been two whole days since B'Elanna was finally let out of the Brig and
Seven had yet to see her. </P>
<P>She had heard from the Doctor that Tom and B'Elanna had broken up. He had
gone on and on about how the Pilot and the Chief Engineer were perfect for each
other, which prompted Seven to point out all the flaws in their
relationship.</P>
<P>Seven slowed down as she reached the door to Cargo Bay 2. She was hesitant to
go in, wondering if she should make one last stop by Engineering, but knew it
would be useless once she got there.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>B'Elanna laid in bed looking up at the grey ceiling, exhausted from her
break-up with Tom. Surprisingly she had remained calm throughout, while Tom
called Seven everything in the book. She knew Tom wasn't going to just accept
breaking up, so she let him rant for half-an-hour, before finally sending him on
his way. </P>
<P>The half-Klingon was still a little confused as to why the Captain had let
her out of the Brig. There was no explanation, Tuvok just said she was free to
go. Of course the fact that she was in the Brig for no reason in the first
place, probably didn't sit too well with the senior officers. She was glad to be
back in her own bed.</P>
<P>Holding the envelope high over head, B'Elanna looked at it from every
possible angle, trying to see if she could catch a glimpse of what was inside.
After about ten minutes of absolutely no luck, B'Elanna put the envelope down
and tried to go to sleep, but had no luck at that either. </P>
<P>She kept thinking about how to make it up to Seven and whether or not the
young Borg would forgive her for accepting Tom's proposal. She kept reaching to
tap her Comm Badge, but could never commit to tapping it. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>The doors opened and Seven walked into a dark Cargo Bay 2. The only source of
light came from the green glow of Seven's Borg Alcove and the yellow light of
candles arranged in a semi-circle in front of it. A red-colored card was placed
in the center of the candles and occupying Seven's usual space as she
regenerated was a small stuffed animal. A bear to be precise. </P>
<P>The door closed behind her, and Seven stepped closer towards the display, but
stopped when a lone figure dressed in a silky white dressed appeared from out of
the dark. B'Elanna held a single red rose in her hands.</P>
<P>"Hi," The half-Klingon smiled.</P>
<P>"Hi," Seven replied.</P>
<P>The two stared intently into each other's eyes for several seconds. B'Elanna
took a step towards the young Borg, then another, and then a third.</P>
<P>"Here," B'Elanna said, handing the rose to Seven.</P>
<P>Seven took the rose in both hands, "It's beautiful." Seven glanced at the
rose, but immediately refocused her eyes on B'Elanna.</P>
<P>"It is," B'Elanna said, taking another step closer towards the beautiful
blonde.</P>
<P>Seven then brought the tip of the rose to her nose and inhaled its fragrant
scent, "It smells nice."</P>
<P>"It does," B'Elanna replied, taking the final step to close the distance
between them. She covered Seven's hands with her own around the rose and brought
the tip of it to her own nose, inhaling the wonderful aroma.</P>
<P>Seven's eyes caressed the Chief Engineer's form, enjoying how the silky white
dress accentuated the curves of her body. </P>
<P>"You look beautiful," Seven complimented.</P>
<P>"So do you," B'Elanna said, noting that Seven was wearing her purple
bio-suit.</P>
<P>Seven's eyes then wandered over to B'Elanna's little display momentarily
before returning to meet B'Elanna's eyes.</P>
<P>The half-Klingon smiled and placed a hand on Seven's back, leading her to the
candles, the card, and the stuffed bear.</P>
<P>As Seven approached, the candles got brighter and the bear got bigger. Her
eyes were drawn towards the stuffed animal and she reached out to it, but
B'Elanna gently stopped her.</P>
<P>"No," B'Elanna placed her hand on top of Seven's outstretched one. "This
first," B'Elanna said, bending down and picking up the red card in the center of
the candles. </P>
<P>Seven took the card in her hands, while B'Elanna took the rose back. The
front was simple, a red heart with the initials B + 7 in the center of it. The
young Borg smiled, then opened up the card. Inside, there was just one word.
Sorry.</P>
<P>The one-word apology brought tears to Seven's eyes.</P>
<P>"So am I," Seven sniffled.</P>
<P>B'Elanna wiped away a tear on Seven's cheek with the back of her hand.</P>
<P>"Tom and I broke up," B'Elanna stated smoothly, looking deep into watery blue
eyes.</P>
<P>"I know, that's why I went to see you in Engineering."</P>
<P>The Chief Engineer gave Seven a puzzled look, "When?"</P>
<P>"Every hour, but I never made it through the door."</P>
<P>B'Elanna laughed out loud. </P>
<P>"How do you do it?" B'Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Do what?"</P>
<P>"Make my insides feel like Jell-O?"</P>
<P>Seven let out a little laugh, "I was going to ask you the same thing."</P>
<P>B'Elanna then took the card out of Seven's hand and placed it and the rose in
the middle of the candles. Taking one hand in each, B'Elanna again locked eyes
with Seven.</P>
<P>"Were you going to ask me to kiss you too?" </P>
<P>Seven responded by leaning closer, which prompted the half-Klingon to lean
closer as well, until their lips met. They shared a soft, gentle kiss, but the
passion that had been denied for an entire week, soon took over. B'Elanna
wrapped her arms around Seven's neck and leaned in further, needing the
closeness of Seven's body.</P>
<P>The kiss lasted for several minutes before B'Elanna reluctantly broke it off
by placing a finger to Seven's lips. </P>
<P>"I want to introduce you to a friend," B'Elanna said while pulling away, her
hand sliding down Seven's arm and then clasping tightly with Seven's hand.
B'Elanna reached into Seven's alcove and grabbed the stuffed bear with her left
hand, her right hand still in Seven's firm grasp. </P>
<P>"Here." B'Elanna handed the bear to Seven.</P>
<P>"What's its name?" Seven asked.</P>
<P>"Actually, she doesn't have one," B'Elanna answered. "But I'm sure we can
come up with a good name together."</P>
<P>"That would be acceptable."</P>
<P>"Yes it would," B'Elanna replied, lost in Seven's eyes. They stood there for
half-a-minute, until B'Elanna remembered what she wanted to say next, "Even
though she doesn't have a name yet, she does have a message for you."</P>
<P>"And what message would that be?"</P>
<P>"Open the locket and find out."</P>
<P>Seven eyed the dangling locket around the bear's neck, which seemed to be
bigger than any conventional locket she'd seen.</P>
<P>Slowly, Seven opened the metallic locket, hearing the latch click open,
before finally revealing what was inside.</P>
<P>Inside, a ring, fashioned with a Delta Quadrant diamond captured Seven's
eyes.</P>
<P>Before Seven could respond, B'Elanna took the stuffed bear from Seven and
bent down on one knee, holding it up by its sides and playing with its
hands.</P>
<P>"Seven of Nine," B'Elanna nearly choked, "Primary-and-Essential-Adjunct of my
heart," The half-Klingon began to tear up and had to close her eyes for a second
to regain her composure, "Will you marry me?" </P>
<P>Seven had seen this image over and over again in Voyager's holo-archives,
minus the bear, but it had always been in the third-person. She had practised
proposing for hours on end, but now she had to answer and she couldn't
speak.</P>
<P>So Seven got down on one knee, moved the teddy bear aside, and planted a soft
kiss on B'Elanna's lips.</P>
<P>The normally fiery half-Klingon closed her eyes and enjoyed the sweetness of
Seven's lips against her own, but it only lasted a second. When she opened her
eyes, Seven's face was aglow with pure joy.</P>
<P>"Is that a yes?" B'Elanna asked.</P>
<P>"Yes," Seven answered, planting another soft kiss on her lover's lips, "But
only if you promise not to break up with me."</P>
<P>"Never," B'Elanna answered, then she took Seven in her arms and kissed her
harder, longer, softer, gentler and more lovingly than she had ever kissed
anyone in her entire life.</P>
