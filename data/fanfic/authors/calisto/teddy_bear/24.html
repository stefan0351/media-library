<P>"Surprise!"</P>
<P>The lights came on and filled the room exposing the waiting Maquis members in
hiding. With her arm draped around B'Elanna's shoulder, Claire watched her
lover's face blush bright red.</P>
<P>"I should have known you were leading me into a trap."</P>
<P>B'Elanna squeezed her lover closer around the waist and planted a wet one on
Claire's cheek.</P>
<P>"Awww," Their friends teased.</P>
<P>"Didn't I tell you what would happen if I caught you guys staring."</P>
<P>B'Elanna put one hand on her hip in mock anger.</P>
<P>Chakotay stepped through the crowd and placed a hand on B'Elanna's shoulder,
covering Claire's arm in the process.</P>
<P>"As I recall, you threatened to cut out our hearts and eat them raw."</P>
<P>Chakotay put a hand over his heart.</P>
<P>"And that's not all I'm gonna do if you don't get your hand off my
girlfriend."</P>
<P>B'Elanna grabbed Chakotay's hand and robotically removed it from Claire's
arm.</P>
<P>The entire room burst out laughing.</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked around the messy room and saw it was devoid of presents.</P>
<P>"Hey, where are all my presents?" B'Elanna scowled.</P>
<P>"Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that," Chakotay said with a grin. "We
all decided that finding presents for you would be like feeding chickens to a
rabbit. So we decided to pool our money together and donate 5 bars of
gold-pressed latinum to the Cardassian orphan fund. See here's the
certificate."</P>
<P>Chakotay handed her a napkin with a few words scribbled on it.</P>
<P>"Very funny guys, but where's the real present." </P>
<P>"Don't worry, you'll find out before the night's over," Chakotay smiled.</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked at him suspiciously then at Claire, who was feigning
innocence.</P>
<P>"Okay fine, until then, Claire and I are going back to our place."</P>
<P>B'Elanna pulled Claire closer and did a 180.</P>
<P>"Hey aren't you gonna have some of the cake," someone shouted.</P>
<P>"Don't worry I got all the cake I need here," B'Elanna almost giggled and
leaned her head on Claire's shoulder, while walking out of the room.</P>
<P>The two entered their room still draped around each other, nuzzling and
whispering naughty things in each other's ears.</P>
<P>But just when they reached the bed and B'Elanna thought something was gonna
happen, Claire pulled away.</P>
<P>"Hey, where are you going?"</P>
<P>B'Elanna's hand lingered on Claire's arm as she walked away and dove into
their closet.</P>
<P>"I'm getting your present, what else?"</P>
<P>"So you decided not to stiff my like the rest of em, huh?" B'Elanna said
while sitting back on the bed, leaning her head against the wall.</P>
<P>"Well actually, we all chipped in for it."</P>
<P>Claire held up a raggedly wrapped jumbled mess. </P>
<P>"If the present's as good as the wrapping, then I'm gonna have to return
it."</P>
<P>Claire walked over to the bed, sat down and placed the present in B'Elanna's
lap.</P>
<P>"Chakotay might take offense to such a comment," Claire smiled.</P>
<P>"You got him to wrap it?" B'Elanna said, surprised at Chakotay's
willingness.</P>
<P>"Of course. The only other person that waits on me hand and foot was getting
the present."</P>
<P>Claire squeezed the rumpled wrapping paper and present in B'Elanna's
hands.</P>
<P>"I do, do I?" B'Elanna mock snarled.</P>
<P>"Well, the guys do say I got you whipped."<BR><BR>Claire quickly jumped up on
the bed and bounced into a sitting position beside B'Elanna, wrapping her arm
around her shoulder, and gave her kiss on the cheek.</P>
<P>"I'm whipped, huh?" </P>
<P>"Yup, now open your present," Claire said excitedly.</P>
<P>"Anything else you want me to do Mistress?"<BR><BR>"Yes, but we can save that
for later on. Right now I want you to open your present."</P>
<P>B'Elanna obeyed, quickly tearing the poorly wrapped present open. Fur, fur,
more fur appeared as B'Elanna tossed the wrapping paper to the floor. </P>
<P>"You guys pooled your money for a stuffed bear?" B'Elanna said
disappointedly.</P>
<P>"Of course not. I bought the bear, and it's not just any bear, it's a special
one. See it's got itty bitty ears, a cute little muzzle, sweet little eyes and
is just so huggable."</P>
<P>Claire squeezed the ears and the muzzle, then picked up the bear and hugged
it.</P>
<P>"Okay, so It's little, what's the big deal."</P>
<P>"Well, I like to call it a messenger bear. It's the bearer of good news. No
pun intended."</P>
<P>Claire cradled the overly large locket around the bear's neck.</P>
<P>"Open it." </P>
<P>B'Elanna eyed the locket, a unusual sense of excitement and anticipation
washed over her. </P>
<P>"It's kind of big for a locket, don't you think?" B'Elanna said
suspiciously.</P>
<P>"Not this locket. Come on, open it."</P>
<P>Claire pushed the locket closer to B'Elanna. </P>
<P>Softly caressing the side of the locket, B'Elanna found the latch and popped
it open, revealing a ring. </P>
<P>Claire slipped in front of the speechless B'Elanna and held the messenger
bear under its arms, toddling it around humorously.</P>
<P>"Will you marry me," Claire said in a sweet little voice, pretending to be
the bear.</P>
<P>B'Elanna's heart exploded, her eyes watered, and her lungs collapsed. She had
always pictured that it would be her asking Claire, and now here she was on the
other end. Startled, surprised, and elated, B'Elanna stared intently into
Claire's eyes.</P>
<P>"No," B'Elanna paused for breath, "but I will marry you."</P>
<P>B'Elanna pushed the bear aside and slid her arms around Claire's neck, giving
her the longest and most passionate kiss of her life.</P>
<P>Then the dream suddenly faded and B'Elanna found herself kissing her new
love, snuggled beside her in the dim light of dawn. </P>
<P>Seven moaned softly, reciprocating the kiss with eyes closed. </P>
<P>The two moments intertwined for B'Elanna as the sun softly glowed along
Seven's face and bare shoulders, making the young Borg seem surreal. Wrapped in
B'Elanna's jacket and the mysterious white towel, the two held each other
tightly against the cold while lying on top of Seven's bio-suit.</P>
<P>B'Elanna brought her lips to Seven's forehead. Seven's entire body shivered
at the soft kiss, which seemed even more intimate than when they kissed with
their lips. It was a confirmation of their love, somehow deeper than passion,
deeper than words, and deeper than thought.</P>
<P>"I love you," the two said simultaneously, bringing a smile to both their
faces.</P>
<P>B'Elanna looked mischievously into Seven's eyes.</P>
<P>"Do you know who you are?" B'Elanna asked while caressing Seven's naked
shoulder.</P>
<P>"Seven of Nine?" The Borg answered, unsure as to the true meaning of the
question.</P>
<P>"No. You're my teddy bear," B'Elanna smiled.</P>
<P>Seven arched an eyebrow.</P>
<P>"Teddy bear?"</P>
<P>"Yeah, it's a stuffed animal."</P>
<P>Seven didn’t see the connection. </P>
<P>"How am I like a stuffed animal?" Seven inquired.</P>
<P>"Well, you're soft. You're cuddly. And you make me feel all warm inside."</P>
<P>B'Elanna kissed Seven on the tip of her nose.</P>
<P>Seven took the kiss in and closed her eyes. Eyes open again, Seven
responded.</P>
<P>"Then you are my teddy bear as well," Seven kissed B'Elanna on her
forehead.</P>
<P>This warmed B'Elanna completely. </P>
<P>"Has anyone ever told you how sweet you are?" B'Elanna asked
rhetorically.</P>
<P>Seven blushed at the compliment. </P>
<P>B'Elanna put her hand on the small of Seven's back and pulled her in closer.
</P>
<P>"When we get back to Voyager, remind me to introduce you to my messenger
bear." B'Elanna whispered into Seven's ear as she seductively claimed an
earlobe. "I think you'll be very interested in what she has to say."</P>
