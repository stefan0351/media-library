<p>Ally went inside the pub immediately as she arrived. She had spent the entire afternoon trying to decide which clothes she would wear later to night. She had finally decided on a purple colored dress. The dress was shoulder less except for two thin threads. It hanged loosely on Ally without looking baggy. When she got inside she saw the gang sitting around a table beside the dancefloor. Her guts disappeared when she noticed Ling wasn't there. She walked over to the table and greeted them all.  "Hi, people."  she said trying to smile faking a happy smile.</p>

<p>"Hey, Ally."  Billy answered along with the others.</p>

<p>"Is Ling here yet?"  Ally asked as she moved to sit at one chair.</p>

<p>"Behind you."  Ling's voice was heard.</p>

<p>Ally turned around and smiled at her. Feeling her bad mood disappear immediately. She closed her arms around Ling's waist and kissed Ling deeply. Ling responded by enclose Ally's neck with her arms. Forgetting about their friends who looked as if they had seen someone getting nude in front of them.</p>

<p>"No!"  Billy screamed jerking them back to reality. He got up with tears falling from his eyes his mouth chewing air. He shook his head and then run out from the bar.</p>

<p>"Billy!"  Georgia called out to her husband. Sighing quietly she stood up and went after him.</p>

<p>"He didn't take that very well."  Ling stated with a smug smile as they all looked after Georgia.</p>

<p>"No he didn't."  Ally agreed, Billy's reaction surprising her.</p>

<p>"A-a-are y-you t-two... ?"  Richard asked not finishing his question.</p>

<p>"A couple?"  Ling asked. Richard nodded. Ling looked at Ally as she said,  "Yeah. We are a couple."</p>

<p>"When?"  John asked. Before they answered he added,  "Why were you two angry on eachother?"</p>

<p>"We... I don't know."  Ally begun to answer.  "We..."  she looked at Ling for help.</p>

<p>"Well, I was angry and..."  Ling hesitated.  "Jealous on Ally because she was dated a friend of mine."  she winced not liking to show her vulnerable side.  "You could say I started the entire fight, by not confessing that I'm in love with her."  she twitched in Ally's direction as she finished talking.</p>

<p>"Will you return to work tomorrow?"  Richard asked as Ally and Ling sat down on two empty chairs.</p>

<p>"Yeah... Sorry that we took the day off."  Ally apologized, not looking like she meant it at all.</p>

<p>At the same time Georgia had caught up with Billy at the office. She looked into his office where she saw him sitting restless in his chair.  "How is it?"  she asked with her gentle voice.</p>

<p>"I-I-I..."  Billy stammered back.</p>

<p>Georgia went over to him and closed her arms around him in a soothing motion.  "Why do you react like this?"  she asked after some moments.</p>

<p>"I feel like... It's a lie."  Billy managed to reply after a while.</p>

<p>"Lie?"  Georgia asked not understanding what her husband meant.</p>

<p>"Yeah... It's like that my childhood love lied to me when she said that she was in love with me."  he shook his head.  "She's a damn liar!"</p>

<p>"Oh, come on!"  Georgia shouted out tired of her husbands whining.  "How the hell does her kissing Ling, make her a liar?"</p>

<p>"..."  Billy had no answer.</p>

<p>"You see? You can't even answer me. Maybe they just joked with us."  Georgia tried to comfort Billy.</p>

<p>"No... I saw the look she gave Ling... I remember when she looked at me the same way..."  Billy's eyes glanced of tears.</p>

<p>"And? She's got over you a long time ago."  Georgia hugged Billy from behind.</p>

<p>"I don't like it! I want to be her BIG love of her life!"  Billy exclaimed angrily.</p>

<p>"And be unhappy for the rest of her life? You haven't planned to dump me, right?"  Georgia asked irritated over Billy's behavior.</p>

<p>"Yeah... As long as she was unhappy I knew she would happily comfort me if I ever lost you. Now she won't try to comfort me wholeheartedly."  Billy replied.</p>

<p>"You want her to be a backup if I died?"  Georgia couldn't believe what she heard.</p>

<p>"Yeah... She would be a perfect backup, don't you think?"  Billy replied thinking his wife understood him and liked it.</p>

<p>"Billy!"  Georgia cried out loudly.  "Do even know what you are saying?"  She gave him an infuriated look.  "That comment is a comment of a male chauvinist PIG. You should be very happy that Ally isn't here and heard you right now. She would kick your sorry ass if she heard that! And if I ever hear you saying something like that again, 'I' WILL kick your ass out of our house!"  she screamed at him.</p>

<p>Billy stared blankly at her.  "What? You take her side of this? I thought you understood me."  he got a sour look.  "No women ever understands me."</p>

<p>"Billy, when did you become a male chauvinist pig?"  Ally asked making both Billy and Georgia look up at Ally who stood leaned at the doorframe.</p>

<p>"H-how?"  Billy stammered.</p>

<p>"Enough to her you stating that you wanted me to be your backup if you ever lost Georgia."  She went over to them leaning closely to Billy she almost whispered,  "I can tell you that I would never be your backup. I would try to comfort you, help you raising Jill and be a good friend. But never, be your lover again."  She smiled an icy smile at him.  "  would never let you hurt me the way you did ever again."</p>

<p>Georgia looked at Ally.  "Why are you here?"  she asked.</p>

<p>"I wondered where you two had gone. Me and Ling want's to treat our friends on a round for coming out."  she wrinkled her nose.  "And because to give them a chance to ask questions. I think they was afraid to actually ask any real questions when we were together."  she smiled a happy smile and looked at them with shining eyes,  "I guess you have questions too right?"</p>

<p>"Well..."  Georgia hesitated.  "I-I, why Ling?"  she shook her head.  "I mean what's there to love in Ling?"</p>

<p>"There is lots of things!"  Ally replied.  "She is so lovely when she wants to."</p>

<p>"I have to agree with Ally."  Billy agreed. Seeing Georgia's look he continued,  "Well you remember when you and Jill were visiting your dying uncle?"  Georgia nodded,  "Well I never really thought about it but you know every one wondered why she left early once a week? She actually left for dancing with old men at a nursing home."</p>

<p>"You're kiddin'."  Georgia looked astonished at Billy.  "Did she really do that? Why hasn't Elaine told me about it?"</p>

<p>"She hasn't? I thought you knew otherwise I would have told you long ago, honey."  Billy said surprised that Elaine hadn't told Georgia anything about it.</p>

<p>"She must have forgot it because Ally was accused to have crashed into that guy with the ugly laugh's car."  Ally interrupted Georgia.</p>

<p>"Oh! Please don't remind me of that... Yuck!"  Ally exclaimed looking disgusted.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>   "Ling. I can't understand this. When did you realize you are in love with Ally?"  Richard asked. Ally had disappeared some seconds before to look after Billy and Georgia.</p>

<p>"Yesterday."  Ling looked back at Richard challenging him to ask another question.  "As a matter of fact, I think I have been in love with her for a long time but didn't acknowledge it to myself until yesterday."  she added after some short moments.</p>

<p>"It's still unbelievable..."  Richard replied.  "All those things you made me do... did they mean anything to you?"</p>

<p>"Well... It was fun. Is that enough for you? The thing you did with the crook of my knee was really nice though."  Ling answered with an innocent look.</p>

<p>"Are you really in love?"  Nelle asked with a concerned look.  "You have never been in love with anyone before."</p>

<p>"And that means I can't fall in love with anyone?"  Ling's voice sounded irritated as she replied. She took a sip from the drink she had orded and then continued,  "I think... No I know Ally is the first person I ever have fallen in love with."  her expression when she said 'love' was so like Ally that it convinced them all that she really was in love. No one except for Renee could make them selves talk. Their minds were busy digesting the fact that Ally and Ling was a couple.</p>

<p>"So anyone want to dance?"  Renee asked. Trying to help Ling by making the group think on something else.</p>

<p>Richard stirred shrugging off his thoughts.  "Yeah... I want to dance."  he and Renee got up and went out on the dancefloor.</p>

<p>Nelle looked at John twitching her head at the dance floor.</p>

<p>John looked back.  "You too?"  he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."  Nelle replied sounding a little bit strained.</p>

<p>"Do you wear the shoes I gave you?"  John asked. Some weeks earlier he had given her a pair of shoes that could change height on the heels.</p>

<p>Looking annoyed she answered,  "Yes I wear them, but no I don't want you to change their heights."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I can't dance when you have lowered the heels on them."  Nelle replied slightly embarrassed.</p>

<p>john made one of those funny faces that he did when he understood something.  "Okay."  he said.  "No changing of heel heights."</p>

<p>Ling laughed as she heard their talk.  "I wouldn't dance with him. He might do it anyway."</p>

<p>"Maybe. but it would have no effect since you don't wear her shoes."  John replied.</p>

<p>"You're right."  Ling remembered something and added,  "There is one thing I would like to ask you about. Will this thing me and Ally have infect anything on her chances to get promoted to junior partner?"</p>

<p>"Are you thinking on someone else than yourself?"  John's eyes grew to two small saucers. He couldn't believe that Ling actually cared about someone else. Even though she had proved it before.</p>

<p>"Yeah... What?"  Ling asked offended by his as well as Nelle's reaction.</p>

<p>"Caring about someone else than yourself... It's not you."  John explained realizing that he didn't have anything against her and Ally's relationship. He was more shocked that Ling was so changed.</p>

<p>"I'm me..."  Ling stated with a hurt voice. Her face expressing sadness.  "I haven't changed at all. I'm just showing my gentle side."  she continued.  "Ally happens to like that side of me."  she explained when she saw her college's doubtful expressions.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>   "Me? How I feel about what you and Ling did downstairs?"  Georgia asked looking at Ally with a puzzled look.</p>

<p>Ally nodded.  "Yes, I do consider you my friend and will you two continue to let me baby-sit Jill?"</p>

<p>"Of course we will. We trust you to keep your love life separated to your duties as a godmother."  Billy replied, Georgia nodding as she agreed to her husband's statement.</p>

<p>"I'm kinda happy... No relieved that you have really found someone else than Billy in your life."  Georgia confessed.  "I just didn't believe it would be Ling."</p>

<p>"Relieved?"  Ally asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Now I don't have to worry that you will try to steal Billy away from me."  Georgia explained.</p>

<p>"Eh... I... Have you two done it yet?"  Billy finally asked after some hesitation.</p>

<p>"Done what? Ally asked looking blankly at Billy.</p>

<p>Billy begun to blush as he replied,  "Y-you know..."</p>

<p>"Oh... You wonder if we have had sex yet?"  Ally giggled at his embarrassment.  "I have walked in on you two having sex here at the office. So why so embarrassed to ask if we have had it yet?"  Ally shook her head and smiled ate him.  "No we haven't have any sex yet. Ling slept over tough and we tricked Renee to believe that we had sex but no."</p>

<p>"Tricked Renee?"  Georgia asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah. We undressed naked and then lied on my bed as if we were sleeping after a night of making hot love."  Ally explained.</p>

<p>"N-naked?"  Billy stammered.</p>

<p>"Mmmhm... She has a really delicious body."  Ally replied remembering every inch of the beautiful body she had seen earlier this morning.</p>

<p>"Okay. You don't have to go into any details."  Georgia interrupted her thoughts.</p>

<p>"Oh, sorry. I think I can simply just forget everything else when I'm thinking about Ling."  Ally got a dreamy look in her eyes.  "She is so sweet."</p>

<p>"Ally? Do you think Ling is sweet? Miss angry face sweet? Man, you really must be in love with her if you think she is sweet."  Billy said as he shook his head. He looked at Ally with an apologetic face and said,  "Ally can you forgive me for my behavior earlier?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can and will do. Have you changed your mind already?"</p>

<p>"Well. To be honest, no. I haven't accepted it yet but I will try. I promise I will try. And you are still welcome to baby-sit Jill when we need a babysitter."  Billy replied.</p>

<p>"That's all we ask for. We didn't expect you to just accept it. We only hoped that you would try to do it."</p>

<p>"Well. I support it."  Georgia said with a smile.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you support me with anyone except Billy?"  Ally replied with a smirk.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but I really do support you being happy. Billy here hurt you enough, so you do deserve it."  Georgia smiled at Ally.  "I can't say that I understand it though. I can't see how a woman can prefer women before men."</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>"One thing though. Are you sure you're gay? Not bi-sexual?"  Georgia asked.</p>

<p>"Well... Before Ling, I have never been in love with a woman or a man except Billy."  Ally smiled a wide smile before she continued,  "But on he other hand, and I realized it right now. I have always viewed Billy as a very manly woman."  Her comment made Georgia laugh and Billy go red as a mad bull.</p>

<p>When she managed to hold her laughs Georgia said,  "I don't agree with you but if that's the way you feel..."  she continued to laugh.</p>

<p>Still blushing bright red, Billy looked at his watch.  "Honey we have to go home. Our nanny is quitting soon."</p>

<p>"Okay honey, let's go home to our baby."  Georgia smiled at her husband.  "Sorry Ally, but it seems that we have to take that drink some other time."</p>

<p>"It's okay. See you guys tomorrow."  Ally waved them good bye as they stepped into the elevator. As she stood there she realized that she was going downstairs too.  "Hey! Wait! I'm going down too."</p>

<p>Billy reacted fast and held the doors as Ally stepped inside the elevator.  "I thought it was strange that you didn't came with us when we left for the elevator."  Billy commented.</p>

<p>"Mmm, probably because I have a lot of things to think about."  Ally replied.</p>

<p>"something the size of Ling?"  Georgia couldn't resist teasing Ally.</p>

<p>"I made that one easy huh?"  Ally smiled at Georgia, who nodded.</p>

<p>As they stepped out of the building Ally waved the married couple good bye and went back into the pub as Billy and Georgia stepped into a cab.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>When Ally came inside the pub she saw Ling sitting at the table along with Nelle and John and Richard dancing with Renee. She went over to the table and sat down beside Ling.</p>

<p>"How did go?"  Ling asked after she had greeted Ally with a small kiss on the cheek.</p>

<p>"We have sorted it out. I'm still godmother to Jill, and they seemed to take the news pretty well. How about you?"  Ally replied and then looked at Nelle and John.</p>

<p>"They seem to have accepted it quite well."  Ling replied looking at them.  "You have accepted it right?"</p>

<p>"Yes we have."  John and Nelle answered simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Could you leave us alone for a while please?"  Ally asked.</p>

<p>"Sure."  John replied as he and Nelle got up. As they went away and began to dance Ling and Ally could hear Nelle mutter to John that she would kill him if he used his little gadget.</p>

<p>"What so you want to talk about?"  Ling asked sounding slightly worried.</p>

<p>"Well... Would you like to spend the night with me?"</p>

<p>"Sure. But this time at my place."  Ling replied.</p>

<p>"Your place?"  Ally asked confused.</p>

<p>"Yeah. If we decide to do other things too."  Ling explained with a mischievous smile.</p>

<p>"Ah... Okay but I have to get my suit for tomorrow's work first."  Ally said. She then stood up, bow for Ling while smiling.  "Would the lady have a last dance with me before the evening ends?"  she asked in an old fashioned style.</p>

<p>"Yes I would gladly."  Ling answered. They both stood up and went out on the dance floor. They danced for about five minutes. Then Vonda began to play  "Fading like a flower". As the slower song played Ally and Ling danced closer to eachother. They continued even after the song had ended and didn't quit until Renee interrupted them telling Ally that she would head for home.</p>

<p>"Good night Renee."  Ally said as Renee went towards the entrance. Renee turned her head and waved good bye.</p>

<p>"Maybe we should go too. We have to get up early tomorrow."  Ling asked.</p>

<p>"Mmm... How far is it from my home to your?"</p>

<p>"We would have to take a cab from your apartment. It's to far to walk."</p>

<p>"How far?"</p>

<p>"Walking, it could take about an hour."  Ling replied.</p>

<p>They got their coats and headed for the entrance. As they got out they felt it was chilly and their breaths steamed out of their mouths. To keep their warmth they walked closely to eachother.</p>

<p>As they walked on the sidewalk Ally remembered that Elaine hadn't been there.  "Hey. In all excitement of telling our friends about our relationship I forgot to ask where Elaine was."</p>

<p>"She had a date."  Ling told Ally.  "I asked when you were gone looking for Georgia and Billy."</p>

<p>"Hope her date was fun. She will be devastated if it wasn't."  Ally giggled.</p>

<p>Ling laughed out loud.  "Yeah I know what you mean... If the others don't tell her tomorrow before we come to office. Who of us will tell her?"</p>

<p>"Well, she's my assistant so I can do it. Or we could do it together."</p>

<p>"Let's do it together."  Ling said as they arrived at Ally's apartment.</p>

<p>As they entered they were met by Renee.  "Hey... Are you sleeping here tonight too?"  she asked.</p>

<p>"No. I'm spending the night at her place instead."  Ally replied.  "I'm just fetching my suit for tomorrow's work and some other stuff too."</p>

<p>"Where did I put my book?"  Ling asked as she went to the coffee table to look after it.</p>

<p>"You put it on my bedside table."  Ally replied from her bedroom.</p>

<p>Ling got the book and looked at the dress suit Ally had picked from her closet.  "Cute."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Most clothes you wear are cute on you."</p>

<p>Ally gave Ling a mock suspicious look.  "You aren't just flattering my ego?"</p>

<p>"Me?!? Oh no... Why would I want to do that?"  Ling replied with an overly serious voice.</p>

<p>"So that I will go easy on you to night."  Ally teased Ling.</p>

<p>Ling smiled back.  "You will be the one begging for mercy."</p>

<p>"We will see about that."  Ally giggled lightly and then sobered.  "I haven't been so relaxed in a relationship since Billy."</p>

<p>"Relaxed?"  Ling asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah... We were like this after a year."  Ally explained.  "Not that all this feel like as we have been together forever. I mean that I feel very comfortable being with you."  Ally laughed lightheartedly.  "When I first met you, I felt you were such a pain in the ass."</p>

<p>"Was I really that bad?"  Ling asked frowning.</p>

<p>Ally nodded with a sorry look.  "Yeah, you were that bad."  thinking back on it she added,  "I didn't really believe you could feel any compassion for anyone until that incident with that boy who wanted to sue God."  smiling at her Ally continued,  "You were really helpful. But Why didn't you want to show us that you could actually cry?"</p>

<p>"How did you know I was crying?"  Ling asked, surprised Ally knew that she had cried.</p>

<p>"Oh, come on. It was obvious that you didn't want us to see you cry."</p>

<p>Ling hesitated before she answered.  "Why I'm always an ice-queen? I guess that it was kinda characterized that way from my childhood. You know I never liked to play with dolls. For me it was cars and such stuff that was fun playing with. My dad once even called me his second son. I've told you that I have an older brother right?"  Ling asked, Ally nodded in reply.  "Anyway I view a guy as someone who is icy and doesn't care about others or at least doesn't show that he cares. Since I wanted to live up to what dad called me I tried to be like that."  Ling shrugged.  "I guess I just continued when I realized it helped dealing with the guys at the factory and in other events when I felt uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"But you weren't icy towards your sister."  Ally pointed out.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but she is family. Good guys are a lot different to their family."  Ling simply walked out of Ally's bedroom and declared with that the chat over.</p>

<p>Ally sighed, she thought she would know more about Ling the longer they were together she put her suit in a protective plastic cover and some other stuff in a bag. She went out of her bedroom and looked at Ling who stood ready at the apartment door.  "I'm ready."  she said smiling at Ling.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"  Renee asked as she got out of the bathroom.</p>

<p>"I'm spending the night at Ling's place."  Ally replied.</p>

<p>"Oh... Have fun."  Renee said as she turned to move to her bedroom.</p>

<p>"Sure will do. Good night."  Ally replied as Ling echoed.</p>

<p>"Good night you two."  she said as she stood in the doorway, waving goodbye.</p>

<p>Ally and Ling got out and called a cab that were leaving its passengers. They got inside the car and Ling told the driver her address.</p>

<p>As they sat in the cab Ling looked at Ally.  "How were you as a kid?"</p>

<p>"Huh? Sorry I was lost in my thoughts, what did you say?"</p>

<p>Ling repeated her question and added,  "What were you thinking about?"</p>

<p>"I thought about if we are going to fast."  Ally answered.  "What do you think?"</p>

<p>"We don't have to have sex. I liked just having you beside me."  Ling replied with a small smile.</p>

<p>"Me too..." Ally agreed returning Ling's smile.  "What was it you wanted to know about my childhood?"  she then asked.</p>

<p>"How was you as a child? I mean were you a boy-girl or girl-girl?"  Ling explained once again.</p>

<p>"Oh, I was a real girl-girl. Even though I liked to be with boys and do boy stuff too."  before she could continue the driver interrupted her.</p>

<p>"Ehrm..."  the driver cleared his throat.  "We are here at the destination now."  he said.</p>

<p>"Oh... What do I owe you?"  Ling asked reaching for her purse.</p>

<p>"Five dollar thirty cent."  the driver replied.</p>

<p>"Here. It's even"  Ling said as she put six dollars in the drivers palm.</p>

<p>Ally and Ling got out of the cab. When Ling went towards the door, she noticed that Ally stayed at the sidewalk. Looking back at her she saw Ally looking at the old building.</p>

<p>"Is it an old building?"  Ally asked when Ling went back to her.</p>

<p>"Yeah. One of my fathers firms restored it and I completely fell in love with one of the apartments."  Ling replied.</p>

<p>"It's beautiful."  Ally looked at Ling.  "Have Richard ever been here? Not that it's any of my business but I'm just curious."  Ally immediately excused her question.</p>

<p>Ling looked seriously at Ally.  "No." she replied.  "No one except my closest friends or my family is allowed in here."</p>

<p>"Am I one of those categories?"  Ally asked curiously.</p>

<p>"No."  Ling replied still serious.</p>

<p>"No? And you are going to let me in to your apartment anyway?"  Ally asked slightly worried that she would have to go home.</p>

<p>"Yes. Because you are a third category."  Ling answered now cracking up in a smile.</p>

<p>"Oh. What category is that?"  Ally asked relieved.</p>

<p>"Those I'm in love with."</p>

<p>"That's a nice category."  Ally smiled back.</p>

<p>They stood on the sidewalk for some minutes before Ling shook her body and said,  "Let's go in it's freezing out here."</p>

<p>Ally agreed and they grabbed eachother's hands and began to walk towards the entrance of the old house smiling at eachother.</p>
