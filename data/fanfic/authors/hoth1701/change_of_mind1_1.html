<!-- Change Of Mind \ Part 1 -->

<p>"Ally! Wake up!" Renee called right next to Ally's ear.</p>

<p>Ally sat up immediately, blinked a couple of times and then asked, "What
time is it?"</p>

<p>"It's about seven." Renee answered walking out into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Why did you wake me up?" Ally whined as she stretched her stiff body.</p>

<p>"Ally!" Renee's voice became hard. "You do have to go to work, or Richard
will fire you."</p>

<p>"But I had such a wonderful dream." Ally yawned and went into the
bathroom. "I wish it wasn't just a dream." Renee heard Ally's dampened
voice through the bathroom door.</p>

<p>When she came out Renee had put a plate with some bacon and eggs for Ally
to eat alongside with coffee and roasted bread.</p>

<p>"So, When are you going to tell me about your dream guy?" Renee asked
with a smile.</p>

<p>"Never!" Ally stuck her tongue out towards her best friend. "Remember
that I said you wouldn't believe me anyway."</p>

<p>"Oh! Come on!" Renee sighed with mock frustration. "You claim that you
have had this dream for nearly two weeks now. Why aren't you telling me who
it is?"</p>

<p>"Okay, okay. Guess who it is." Ally sighed as she finally gave in to
Renee.</p>

<p>"Okay..." Renee thought about different candidates before she said, "Mel
Gibson."</p>

<p>Ally laughed at her and shook her head. "Nope, try again."</p>

<p>Renee thought it through again but gave up. "Please give me some clue at
least." she begged.</p>

<p>"My so called 'man' of my dreams has breasts, we both know 'him' and 'he'
works at the same firm as I do. Finally 'he' is single I think." Ally had a
dreamy look in her face as she described her dream lover.</p>

<p>"Are you telling me it's a "she"?" Renee made quotation marks with her
hands, thinking that Ally was joking. But Ally's sincere look made her
realize she wasn't.</p>

<p>"Yes. That's why I haven't told you who it was, I was afraid you would
tease me forever. You already have had fun teasing me about that kiss I had
with Ling. Now, are you going to guess? I will be late if you don't guess
soon." Ally tried not to notice Renee's almost open jaw and her shocked
look.</p>

<p>"Let's see..." Renee tried to hide her shock while guessing. "It's not
Elaine right? 'Cause she and you have been seeing each other quite a lot
lately."</p>

<p>"No." Ally shook her head. "Elaine has just broken up with her latest
boyfriend and needed a friend."</p>

<p>"So, she is single?" Renee smiled and made a face. "Then she does fill up
all those hints you gave me."</p>

<p>"She isn't the only one." Ally grinned at Renee.</p>

<p>Renee thought for another minute and then her face lit up, as she
understood whom her best friend was in love with. "Of course." she said.
"Why didn't I see that immediately? It's Ling."</p>

<p>Ally nodded as her lips made a small smile. She then said, "Promise me that
you don't tell anyone."</p>

<p>"Does she know it?" Renee closed the space between them with almost a
frightened look.</p>

<p>"No! You know she told me that she wanted a partner with a penis." Ally
sighed miserably, facing the ceiling she continued, "I think I managed not
to show her how hurt I was by her saying that."</p>

<p>Renee nodded, she remembered Ally describing what had happened that night
at Ally's office. Since she couldn't really understand it, Renee didn't
know what to say.</p>

<p>Ally dried a single tear and said with nonexistent self-confidence, "I
think I have to try to get over her too. I don't think I will though." She
then looked at her wristwatch and exclaimed, "Oh, no! I'm going to be late
again." She began to run around in the apartment panicking.</p>

<p>"Bye Renee. I'll be fine, promise. And by the way, you are really good
not showing how shocked you are." she called back to Renee as she ran out
through the apartment door.</p>

<p>Renee watched the door as it shut with a slam after her best friend. She
really wanted her to be happy but wondered if she really could be that with
another woman. Shaking her head she realized that her best friend actually
was gay or maybe bi-sexual, whatever the correct term was she could tell
from Ally's way of acting that she was clearly in love with... Ling.
Feeling a little bit uncomfortably about it she shrugged it off thinking
she would be able to talk with Ally later as she went off to her very own
firm.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Ally ran out of the elevator as soon as she could get through the doors and
hurried down to the conference room. She didn't even take the time to grab
the coffee, offered by Elaine. She stepped in and sat down right next to
Ling! Thinking about what she had told Renee she almost forgot to breathe
or excuse herself for being late.</p>

<p>"Hi Ally, nice you wanted to be here." Richard said as he and the others
greeted her. He looked down on the paper he was holding and said, "Can you
take this case?" he handled Ally a folder with some papers in it.</p>

<p>"What is it about?" Ally asked.</p>

<p>"Well... It is a... client who want some help with cutting taxes."
Richard replied seeming a bit nervous Looking over at Ling.</p>

<p>"Actually, it is one of my bar-corporations who needs to cut their
taxes." Ling explained.</p>

<p>"So, will you help me with it?" Ally asked looking intensely at Ling. She
was surprised how normal she sounded, she didn't even stammer. Letting her
dream run through her mind she blushed slightly, almost missing Ling's
response.</p>

<p>Ling looked back, her eyes surprised at Ally's intense look. "Yes I will.
As a matter of fact the chief executive for their financial department will
meet us for a lunch later to day." She paused for a minute and then added
with her usual cool but fast paced voice, "If it is okay with you of
course." The entire moment gave her a strange feeling of déjà vu but it was
dismissed as quickly as it appeared.</p>

<p>"Um... Let me check with Elaine first, but I don't think I've anything
particular going on at the present." Ally replied. She felt glad that she
was going to have a lunch with Ling. No, that was not right! She must
forget her. Snapping out of her thoughts she hoped no one had noticed her
day dreaming. She really hated when she got lost in her own thoughts.</p>

<p>Richard, and the others were surprised as how unusually cool Ally had acted
around Ling this morning, it was nothing at all like these last few weeks
where she'd been acting the funny way she always did when she is... No,
Richard could not believe the thought he just had. No, she couldn't be...
in... love?! "Well then. Everyone have work?" Richard asked as he gathered
his papers trying to shrug it off. No one opposed him and they all left for
their own offices.</p>

<p>On her way back to her own office Ling suddenly realized from where the
déjà vu had come from, she realized she must have looked the same way at
Ally after that irritating dream that wouldn't go away. Realizing she acted
like Ally she pushed those thoughts deep down in her mind and began to
think about changing what she was wearing for lunch.</p>

<p>Elaine followed Ally as she stepped inside her office. "Here is some coffee
and today's mail."</p>

<p>"Thanks Elaine. If I have anything booked up for today's lunch, cancel or
postpone it."</p>

<p>"Oh? May I ask why?" Elaine's ears became radars on red alert.</p>

<p>"I'm just having dinner... I mean lunch with Ling. No I mean Ling and I
are having 'lunch' with a client." Ally, angry on her self for being so
whimsy. "By the way, I have to talk with her." Ally left her room but
stopped dead at the door, Elaine who had followed her bumped right into her
so that they both fell to the floor. Ally glared at Elaine and said with
the harshest voice she could manage, "And you don't even dare to eavesdrop
on us."</p>

<p>Elaine sighed and smiled at Ally, disappointed she said, "Okay" she then
pointed a finger at Ally and added with a wicked smile, "This is only
because you have been so nice at me lately, consider it a favor." She then
stood up and sat down at her desk and began checking Ally's calendar all
while Ally glared at her wishing looks could kill.</p>

<p>Ally stood up, dusted off her suit and walked over to Ling's room. There
she knocked on Ling's door and then waited for the young East Asian woman
to let her inside.</p>

<p>"Come!" she heard a voice from the other side of the door.</p>

<p>Ally hesitated for a moment, then went in and closed the door behind her.
Ling was behind some screens where she was changing her clothes. The
sunlight made the screen partly transparent in the way that Ally could see
Ling's shadow stand out through them. She saw how Ling took her clothes off
and then put on a dress. She imagined her eyes growing to two big saucers
and it made Ally feel a tingle she had felt before deep inside her as she
saw the smooth movements made by the person behind the screens. Looking at
the shadows took up all her attention so she missed what Ling said
completely.</p>

<p>"Uh? What? Sorry, what did you say?" Ally asked Ling.</p>

<p>"What do you want to talk with 'me' about?" Ling repeated, clearly
irritated.</p>

<p>"Uh... yeah... well, how come you have a bar-corporation?" Ally asked
cursing her self for her disability to tell Ling that she wanted to break
the promise they had made to each other.</p>

<p>"What?" Ling seemed even more irritated and Ally was sure she actually
growled at her.</p>

<p>"Eh... I'm just curious. Is there anything you don't own?" Ally
stammered, her cheeks reddening to look like two red tomatoes.</p>

<p>"I inherited them from an uncle." was the simple reply.</p>

<p>"Well when are we supposed to meet with their representative?" Ally
managed to ask still with two red tomatoes instead of her normal cheeks.</p>

<p>"About 11:15 am. I'll come and get you when it's time." Ling responded
not growling at Ally anymore.</p>

<p>Ally could clearly hear the dismissal in the voice and managed a 'thanks',
before she left and went back to her own desk. She heard Ling saying a
"You're welcome" as she stepped out of her office, missing a suspicious
Ling who looked after her from behind the screen.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Ally sat in her office and tried to come up with different strategies to
reduce the taxes when Ling entered her room without announcing herself at
all. She looked absolutely stunning in the short white firm lined cotton
dress.</p>

<p>"We have to leave now. Are you coming?" she asked her body screaming out
impatience</p>

<p>"Oh? I'll be finished soon. Where are we going to eat? I mean meet with
their representative?" Ally could barely take her eyes of Ling. She wanted
to jump out of her chair, declare her undying love for her and kiss her
deeply. Which made her replay the scene all over again.</p>

<p>Ling looked suspiciously at Ally as she repeated, "We will meet her at one
of my bars." It was obvious that Ally had missed her the first time.</p>

<p>"Okay." Ally stirred looking after the papers she needed to bring. She
put them in her briefcase and stood up walking up beside Ling.</p>

<p>"I'll drive." Ling said with her ice-queen face. They walked out of
Ally's office, Ling first of course.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>When they arrived at the bar, Ally noticed it was quite nice holding a
special feeling. They saw a woman about five years older than her or Ling
sitting at the other end of the bar. She was blond with thick locks that
framed her light skinned face. Her lips were small but had a warmth red
glow that made people notice. Her eyes were as blue as the sky and held an
intelligent sparkle. Her cute perfectly sized nose was slightly pointing
upward adding to the entire look of the gorgeous and cute face. Her body
became visible as she stood up to greet Ally and Ling. It was quite tall
and had curves without being overweighed. It was obviously that this woman
scheduled her time to include a lot of training so she could stay in shape.</p>

<p>"She is gorgeous." Ally whispered to Ling as they went over to the table
where she stood waiting for them. She noticed her comment made Ling frown
for a short moment.</p>

<p>Slightly jealous of Ally's comment Ling commented, "She should be since she
was a model before she went into business."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>Ling replied with a sharp, "Yes."</p>

<p>When they reached the table Ling presented Ally to Mia Oskarsson.</p>

<p>"Oskarsson? Where are you from?" Ally asked curious about the strange
name.</p>

<p>"I'm Swedish." Mia replied with a heart-crushing smile.</p>

<p>As they sat down Ally looked around and commented, "I really like this
place. It has something that is different from other bars I have been in."</p>

<p>"Really? That will make my sister happy. She is managing this place." Mia
gave Ally another smile.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but where are the men?" Ally finally noticing what had bothered
her when they had entered the bar.</p>

<p>"Ling! Haven't you told her this is a gay-bar? And that we who run it are
gay people?" Mia shot an angry look at Ling who smiled a wicked grin.</p>

<p>"Sorry Mia. I just wanted to see how she would react when you told her."
Ling looked at Ally who had frozen with her mouth wide open. She grinned
deviously on Ally who after a short moment managed to knock her out of her
own paralysis still feeling like she would explode like an old steam
engine.</p>

<p>"I... I'm so sorry for my reaction." She managed to say after several
seconds. To afraid to offend the lesbian woman to even try to say anything
else.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be sorry. We are used to it." Mia replied with a slightly
tired face.</p>

<p>"I... Are you gay?" Ally managed not to look too curious as she asked
Mia.</p>

<p>"Yes I am. Have been since I was 22, when I met my first girlfriend." Mia
said preparing for the normal flow of questions that she usually got from
those who didn't know from the beginning that she was gay.</p>

<p>"First?"</p>

<p>Surprised at the different question Mia replied, "Yes, I have had three
others since then but none at the moment."</p>

<p>"Oh..." Ally wondered if Mia could help her with her own feelings for
Ling.</p>

<p>After some quiet minutes the lunch went on without any other interruptions
and at the end they had come up with a working strategy for how to lower
the corporation's taxes.</p>

<p>When Ally excused herself and left for the restroom Mia asked Ling, "Is
Ally gay or something?"</p>

<p>"No. She is definitely straight." Ling responded.</p>

<p>"You're sure?" Mia's eyes displaying doubt. "She didn't react the same
way as other straight people do when they find out."</p>

<p>"Well... We kind of experimented some weeks ago." Ling thought for a
short moment. "We had dinner, danced and then the day after we kissed."
Blushing slightly she added, "When we danced, it really turned me on.
Probably because we teased a group of guys who had watched us while ate."</p>

<p>"You? You are the straightest person I know. Did you really kiss her?"
Mia amused of Ling's confession continued with an interested look in her
eyes, "How did it feel?"</p>

<p>Ling looked back at Mia with a look of both longing and abhorrence, she
then leant forward and whispered in her ear, "Let me say... Unfortunately
it was good enough to make me want to rip off her clothes. We actually
kissed twice."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you do it? I mean ripped off her clothes." Mia not believing
that her friend would even admit something like that.</p>

<p>Ling looked at Mia with a disgusted look. "I'm not gay!" she exclaimed with
a loud voice dragging attention from women around the bar. "No offense."
she added after a short while actually afraid she had hurt her friend.</p>

<p>"None taken." Mia who knew how Ling could be shrugged it off. "But that
doesn't mean that she is straight."</p>

<p>"Oh, later when we talked about it I told her that even though I liked
the kiss, I need a penis and she agreed with me." Ling got a superior look
as she added, "Does that make her gay?" having a soft look she then added,
"Besides, we promised each other to not share any real kisses with any
other women ever..."</p>

<p>Before Mia could say anything Ally returned and they all stood up.</p>

<p>As they walked out of the bar Ally looked hesitantly at Mia. "What... Eh,
Mia, what are you doing to night?"</p>

<p>Surprised at her question Mia managed to barely reply, "Uh, nothing
particular."</p>

<p>"Than we can fix these details to night then?" Ally added with a shy
smile, "Maybe have dinner afterwards." Realizing what she just said her
smile disappeared. But as she blushed bright red she didn't say anything to
correct it. She cursed herself for implying something else than just a
dinner.</p>

<p>"Uhuh, sure." Mia looked at Ling with a look of triumph and said, "When?"</p>

<p>"Shall we say six p.m., at my... office?" Ally's lips turned into a
plastic smile reminding of Biscuit's smile therapy.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'll be there." Mia returned the smile not noticing how false it
was and waved them goodbye.</p>

<p>On the way back to the office Ally on how to not offend Mia later, missed
completely Ling's pale face and infuriated looks shot at her. When they
entered the office, Ally walked into her room and didn't even notice Ling
who followed closely behind her.</p>

<p>Ling closed the door and locked it. "What the hell was that?" she said
almost screaming.</p>

<p>"What?" Ally looked up into two burning eyes.</p>

<p>"You're not gay, why are you going to date her then?" Ling continued
still with a loud voice.</p>

<p>Ally worried that Ling's voice was heard through the door replied with a
low voice, "You hate me so why would you even care?" feeling slightly
irritated she added, "I might even brake the promise we gave each other."
To late seeing how hurt Ling had become of her statement she regretted what
she said.</p>

<p>Ling who had let her ice-queen manner replaced her earlier infuriated look.
"If that's the way you want it. I don't wish you luck." she said with a low
voice before she with her normal cool style walked out of Ally's room.</p>

<p>Ally looked after Ling with a longing look wishing things were very much
different but couldn't make herself do anything about it.</p>

<p>Moments after Ling had walked out, Elaine walked in with her curios eyes
and ears at red alert. "What did you two fight about?"</p>

<p>"Out!" was the only reply Elaine got.</p>

<p>"I heard something about a date..." Elaine continued hoping to make Ally
revel something by mistake.</p>

<p>"Like I would ever tell you! I said OUT!" Ally growled at Elaine.</p>

<p>Elaine turning around and quietly adding, "Snappish now again, and who was
so nice to her today."</p>

<p>"I heard that!" screamed Ally at her as she followed her and closed the
door with a huge slam after Elaine.</p>

<p>Elaine pretending that nothing happened smiled at her co-workers sat down
at her desk answering the phone.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Fifteen minutes before six, Ally watched the wristwatch nervously. She was
afraid that Mia wouldn't show up. Thinking that she should explain to Mia
what she really meant when she offered dinner. She also felt curious to how
it would really feel like, having a 'date' with someone with her own sex.
She had thought about it for almost the entire afternoon and finally
decided to have a dinner with Mia treating it like a date, besides it
couldn't hurt that much right? She could always say they didn't fit
together if it worked out in wrong direction.</p>

<p>Two minutes before six, Mia knocked at Ally's door nervous and afraid that
Ally hadn't meant the dinner as an offer of a date. She hadn't been dating
at all for almost six months...</p>

<p>Ally heard a knock on her door and realized that it probably was Mia.
Swallowing nervously she said, "Come in!" smiling nervously at the door.</p>

<p>"Eh... Hi." Mia managed to say. She had changed into a short black dress
that followed her lines without leaning tight against her skin.</p>

<p>Ally couldn't even open her mouth, well it was open already. After a long
moment of simply staring at each other Ally dropped her pen just to get an
excuse for breaking eye contact. She ducked below her desk hearing her
heart beating like church-bells, imagining Mia hearing it. Cursing herself
for having feelings that was not suitable for the situation. "I'm having
feelings for Ling, her. Soon I'm  horny on everyone!" she cursed to herself
quietly.</p>

<p>"Eh... Did you say anything?" Mia heard Ally mumbling something about
Ling.</p>

<p>"Oh... Nothing... Well, I cursed myself for being so clumsy." Ally tried
to smile herself to confidence but didn't convince either herself or Mia.
Mia shrugged it off as nervousness, she guessed quite accurately that Ally
never had been on a date with a woman before. </p>

<p>Remembering that she had forgotten to greet Mia, Ally blushed and
stammered, "H... Hello..." Uncertain if she should take her hand or hug her
she simply stood there and waited for Mia to react. After some uneasy
moments they shook hands and Ally said, "Ehm... Pardon me for my lack of
hospitality, please sit down." Ally blushed slightly of embarrassment as
she mentioned the chair in front of her desk.</p>

<p>Mia sat down and Ally gave her some papers. "These are some suggestions on
what we can do." Ally said while Mia skimmed through the papers.</p>

<p>Mia returned the papers when she was finished and said, "Shall we go?"</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure all these ideas are good, but I don't really feel like working to
night." she smiled at Ally with one of her ice melting smiles and added,
"So, where are you going to take me?"</p>

<p>"Ehm... To bed, no reg..." Ally took a deep breath trying not to return
Mia's amused smile. "To a place some blocks down the street." she finally
managed to say.</p>

<p>Giving away a short laugh Mia said, "Have anyone ever told you that you are
really funny?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, many people. Thanks for the compliment. You look goreg..." Ally
cut herself off before she said something she would regret later.</p>

<p>Mia did hear it though and understood what Ally almost had said. "Thank
you." she said, smiling at Ally she continued, "You look great too."</p>

<p>Ally blushed and stammered some thanks, looking away.</p>

<p>Trying to make Ally feel a bit more at ease Mia said, "Let's go, I'm
starving."</p>

<p>Ally agreed and they left for the dinner.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>At the restaurant Ally felt at the beginning, it all was just a reply of
what had occurred with Ling.</p>

<p>"So, you became gay when you were 22, right?" Ally said to break the
silence.</p>

<p>"Um... Yes, actually I think I have been all my life but didn't realize
it until I was 22." Mia explained, feeling grateful that Ally had finally
broken the silence.</p>

<p>"Could you explain it with a bit more... details?" Ally hesitated afraid
to offend Mia.</p>

<p>"Well... In high school, I dated only three guys, and I never really felt
anything for them. Nothing like I did with my first girlfriend."</p>

<p>"Three guys? That's more than I did. I had one long relationship with
Billy until the second year at college." Ally interrupted.</p>

<p>"I never went to college until after I had done some modeling. Actually I
modeled to pay for my college studies."</p>

<p>"Did you make lot of money modeling?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I still had to live in a dorm. But I don't regret it since it
was there I met my first girlfriend."</p>

<p>"How?" Ally became really curious. Not being able to hide it she noticed
that Mia seemed to be amused.</p>

<p>"She was a student prefect and we shared room." thinking back at her
college time Mia continued, "There was this guy who refused to leave me
alone. He almost stalked me. I complained to her and one day when she and I
sat in the park outside the student's union building, he came up and began
trying to convince me to go out with him. Then right there she kissed me."
smiling at the memory she looked at Ally who seemed lost in thoughts.
"Hello?" Mia said waving her hand in front of Ally. "Are you listening?"</p>

<p>"Oh... yeah, please go on." Ally tried unsuccessfully not blushing.</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly what she told him because I was completely caught
up in digesting the kiss. Anyway he seemed a bit confused but it really
made him stop pursuing me. I didn't talk with her for an entire week. and
then I tried to stay away from her as much as I could."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I don't even know why. I simply felt uncomfortable with her."</p>

<p>"Uncomfortable? why uncomfortable?"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't exactly feel uncomfortable." Mia got a dreamy look. "It
was actually something I never really felt before, so I misunderstood it
for un-comfort."</p>

<p>"Oh... I see. I have done that a lot of times even with feelings I have
had before." Ally nodded in understanding what Mia meant.</p>

<p>Mia continued, "Eventually she got tired of it since we were room mates and
confronted me. I confessed that I had liked our kiss and then she asked if
I would like to kiss her again. I said yes and we did it again, and again,
and again. We made out for about an hour before we parted and she told me
she was in love with me. She had been since the first time she had met me."
Mia continued to tell Ally about her first experiences with her first
girlfriend. She was surprised at how easy she revealed her past for Ally
who listened at her intently. Her curiosity shining through her eyes.</p>

<p>When Mia was finished she looked at Ally and said, "So how come you are a
lawyer?"</p>

<p>Seeming a bit embarrassed Ally replied, "Well, actually I became a lawyer
because of my ex-boyfriend Billy. He wanted to study law and I who wanted
to be with him choose law to."</p>

<p>"Really? Just because you wanted to be with him?" Mia didn't believe her
first.</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm not that proud about that, but I found that law did suit me
nicely so I continued and became a lawyer." Looking a bit sad Ally
continued, "We stayed together for the first year then he choose to move to
Chicago and I to stay here in Boston."</p>

<p>"That sounds sad. Did it take you long time to get over him?"</p>

<p>"Mmm... I don't think I'm really completely over him yet, but I do know
one thing." Ally smiled at Mia. "I am not attracted to him anymore. Not
that he isn't a good looking guy."</p>

<p>"Anymore? You've met him again?"</p>

<p>"We and his wife work at the same firm."</p>

<p>Mia's jaw dropped to the floor. "You're kiddin'!"</p>

<p>"No I'm not. We work really well together." Ally slightly amused.
"Georgia and I are quite good friends too."</p>

<p>"Oh? Is she a good looking woman?" Mia sounded curious.</p>

<p>Looking back at Mia, Ally got a sheepish look. "I have only one word for
her, gorgeous. She is absolutely gorgeous."</p>

<p>Mia smiled at Ally's dreamy face. Before she could say anything, Ally
pointed in the direction of the bar.</p>

<p>"Look at those guys!" she exclaimed with a hushed voice, leaning over
towards Mia.</p>

<p>Mia looked over her shoulder and saw a group of guys standing at the bar
looking at her and Ally. "Uhuh? What about them?" Mia asked with little
interest.</p>

<p>"I don't know if Ling have told you anything about our dinner. That we
had here." Ally explained.</p>

<p>"Ahh... It's those guys." Mia smiled as she remembered what Ling had told
her earlier.</p>

<p>"Care to do it with me?" Ally's eyes shined of mischievous as she asked
her dinner partner.</p>

<p>"I don't see the meaning to tease them." Mia shrugged. "If we had been at
my sisters place, I would have had said yes right away. But here..." Mia
seemed to think it over. "No. I don't think so."</p>

<p>"Oh... Do you like to just dance then?" Ally asked, her disappointment
showing through.</p>

<p>"Well... That sounds like a nice idea though, shall we?" Mia replied as
she stood up and offered Ally her arm.</p>

<p>Smiling, Ally took it and let Mia lead her out on the dance-floor just
below their table. The band played some kind of slow pop/samba mixture easy
to dance to. After only some minutes had the world disappeared around them
and all they saw was eachother. Not noticing the looks they attracted from
everyone around the dance-floor. They continued to dance even after the
song had ended and didn't stop until after the third song which was a
ballad. Then they simply stood there lost in eachother's eyes. Hesitantly
Mia began to move her mouth against Ally's but her lips only brushed them
briefly before Ally, blushing broke contact and went back to the table.</p>

<p>Mia hurrying after her looking both hurt and disappointed, sat down in
front of Ally. "I'm so sorry." she said not feeling sorry at all.</p>

<p>"Ehm... No. I am the one who should be sorry." Ally replied her blood
vessels in her cheeks filled with warm red blood. "I... I can't do it. I'm
sorry. It's not because I'm straight or not attracted to you..."</p>

<p>"You are?" Mia asked realizing the 'date' was going to end soon.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. But... I... Am..." Ally not able to look Mia in her eyes, let
her gaze trail off and landed on a pair of dark almost black eyes returning
her gaze with a cool iciness. Recognizing them as belonging to the item of
her love Ally got mad and she did something she immediately regretted.
"What the hell... You only live once." she said and kissed Mia right in
front of everyone in the restaurant.</p>

<p>Mia had closed her eyes while the kiss lasted and then slowly opened them
looking at Ally. "Wow." she said smiling weakly. "You really are a good
kisser."</p>

<p>Returning her smile, Ally looked at Mia while sealing her anger. "Would you
like to come with me to my apartment and drink some coffee?" she then asked
cursing herself for making another mistake. She hoped that Mia would turn
down her offer but saw that it would not happen.</p>

<p>"Sorry, I don't drink coffee. I prefer tea. But I could do an exception
if you like." Mia answered. Hoping maybe something else would also occur.</p>

<p>"Oh... Tea is fine too." Ally answered. They stood up, Ally left money to
pay the receipt and then they left. Outside the restaurant Mia held out her
hand, waiting to see if Ally would take it. After some hesitation Ally
grabbed it, she was surprised at how nice and gentle it felt as they went
off in silence.</p>

<p>  "Do you have anything with it?" Ally asked as she poured tea in two cups.</p>

<p>"No. just plain tea thanks." Mia replied. After they had entered Ally's
apartment, Ally had kept a certain distance between them making Mia feel
that Ally wasn't interested in anything more than friendship.</p>

<p>As they sat there in awkwardness the door opened and Renee came in. Ally
jumped up from the couch and looked guilty at Renee as she saw them there
in surprise. Mia looked at the beautiful black woman who stood in front of
them.</p>

<p>"Eh... Renee this is Mia Oskar..." Ally looked at Mia unsure on how to
pronounce her surname.</p>

<p>"Oskarsson." Mia helped.</p>

<p>"Mia this is Renee, my roommate." Ally said presenting them for
eachother.</p>

<p>Renee stepped forward as Mia stood up. "Nice to see you... Mia." Renee said
with one of her pleasant smiles as they shook hands.</p>

<p>Mia returned the smile liking the woman instantly and said, "It's nice to
meet you to."</p>
