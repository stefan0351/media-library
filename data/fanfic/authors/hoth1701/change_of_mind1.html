<p>"Ally! Wake up!" Renee called right next to Ally's ear.</p>

<p>Ally sat up immediately, blinked a couple of times and then asked, "What
time is it?"</p>

<p>"It's about seven." Renee answered walking out into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Why did you wake me up?" Ally whined as she stretched her stiff body.</p>

<p>"Ally!" Renee's voice became hard. "You do have to go to work, or Richard
will fire you."</p>

<p>"But I had such a wonderful dream." Ally yawned and went into the
bathroom. "I wish it wasn't just a dream." Renee heard Ally's dampened
voice through the bathroom door.</p>

<p>When she came out Renee had put a plate with some bacon and eggs for Ally
to eat alongside with coffee and roasted bread.</p>

<p>"So, When are you going to tell me about your dream guy?" Renee asked
with a smile.</p>

<p>"Never!" Ally stuck her tongue out towards her best friend. "Remember
that I said you wouldn't believe me anyway."</p>

<p>"Oh! Come on!" Renee sighed with mock frustration. "You claim that you
have had this dream for nearly two weeks now. Why aren't you telling me who
it is?"</p>

<p>"Okay, okay. Guess who it is." Ally sighed as she finally gave in to
Renee.</p>

<p>"Okay..." Renee thought about different candidates before she said, "Mel
Gibson."</p>

<p>Ally laughed at her and shook her head. "Nope, try again."</p>

<p>Renee thought it through again but gave up. "Please give me some clue at
least." she begged.</p>

<p>"My so called 'man' of my dreams has breasts, we both know 'him' and 'he'
works at the same firm as I do. Finally 'he' is single I think." Ally had a
dreamy look in her face as she described her dream lover.</p>

<p>"Are you telling me it's a "she"?" Renee made quotation marks with her
hands, thinking that Ally was joking. But Ally's sincere look made her
realize she wasn't.</p>

<p>"Yes. That's why I haven't told you who it was, I was afraid you would
tease me forever. You already have had fun teasing me about that kiss I had
with Ling. Now, are you going to guess? I will be late if you don't guess
soon." Ally tried not to notice Renee's almost open jaw and her shocked
look.</p>

<p>"Let's see..." Renee tried to hide her shock while guessing. "It's not
Elaine right? 'Cause she and you have been seeing each other quite a lot
lately."</p>

<p>"No." Ally shook her head. "Elaine has just broken up with her latest
boyfriend and needed a friend."</p>

<p>"So, she is single?" Renee smiled and made a face. "Then she does fill up
all those hints you gave me."</p>

<p>"She isn't the only one." Ally grinned at Renee.</p>

<p>Renee thought for another minute and then her face lit up, as she
understood whom her best friend was in love with. "Of course." she said.
"Why didn't I see that immediately? It's Ling."</p>

<p>Ally nodded as her lips made a small smile. She then said, "Promise me that
you don't tell anyone."</p>

<p>"Does she know it?" Renee closed the space between them with almost a
frightened look.</p>

<p>"No! You know she told me that she wanted a partner with a penis." Ally
sighed miserably, facing the ceiling she continued, "I think I managed not
to show her how hurt I was by her saying that."</p>

<p>Renee nodded, she remembered Ally describing what had happened that night
at Ally's office. Since she couldn't really understand it, Renee didn't
know what to say.</p>

<p>Ally dried a single tear and said with nonexistent self-confidence, "I
think I have to try to get over her too. I don't think I will though." She
then looked at her wristwatch and exclaimed, "Oh, no! I'm going to be late
again." She began to run around in the apartment panicking.</p>

<p>"Bye Renee. I'll be fine, promise. And by the way, you are really good
not showing how shocked you are." she called back to Renee as she ran out
through the apartment door.</p>

<p>Renee watched the door as it shut with a slam after her best friend. She
really wanted her to be happy but wondered if she really could be that with
another woman. Shaking her head she realized that her best friend actually
was gay or maybe bi-sexual, whatever the correct term was she could tell
from Ally's way of acting that she was clearly in love with... Ling.
Feeling a little bit uncomfortably about it she shrugged it off thinking
she would be able to talk with Ally later as she went off to her very own
firm.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Ally ran out of the elevator as soon as she could get through the doors and
hurried down to the conference room. She didn't even take the time to grab
the coffee, offered by Elaine. She stepped in and sat down right next to
Ling! Thinking about what she had told Renee she almost forgot to breathe
or excuse herself for being late.</p>

<p>"Hi Ally, nice you wanted to be here." Richard said as he and the others
greeted her. He looked down on the paper he was holding and said, "Can you
take this case?" he handled Ally a folder with some papers in it.</p>

<p>"What is it about?" Ally asked.</p>

<p>"Well... It is a... client who want some help with cutting taxes."
Richard replied seeming a bit nervous Looking over at Ling.</p>

<p>"Actually, it is one of my bar-corporations who needs to cut their
taxes." Ling explained.</p>

<p>"So, will you help me with it?" Ally asked looking intensely at Ling. She
was surprised how normal she sounded, she didn't even stammer. Letting her
dream run through her mind she blushed slightly, almost missing Ling's
response.</p>

<p>Ling looked back, her eyes surprised at Ally's intense look. "Yes I will.
As a matter of fact the chief executive for their financial department will
meet us for a lunch later to day." She paused for a minute and then added
with her usual cool but fast paced voice, "If it is okay with you of
course." The entire moment gave her a strange feeling of déjà vu but it was
dismissed as quickly as it appeared.</p>

<p>"Um... Let me check with Elaine first, but I don't think I've anything
particular going on at the present." Ally replied. She felt glad that she
was going to have a lunch with Ling. No, that was not right! She must
forget her. Snapping out of her thoughts she hoped no one had noticed her
day dreaming. She really hated when she got lost in her own thoughts.</p>

<p>Richard, and the others were surprised as how unusually cool Ally had acted
around Ling this morning, it was nothing at all like these last few weeks
where she'd been acting the funny way she always did when she is... No,
Richard could not believe the thought he just had. No, she couldn't be...
in... love?! "Well then. Everyone have work?" Richard asked as he gathered
his papers trying to shrug it off. No one opposed him and they all left for
their own offices.</p>

<p>On her way back to her own office Ling suddenly realized from where the
déjà vu had come from, she realized she must have looked the same way at
Ally after that irritating dream that wouldn't go away. Realizing she acted
like Ally she pushed those thoughts deep down in her mind and began to
think about changing what she was wearing for lunch.</p>

<p>Elaine followed Ally as she stepped inside her office. "Here is some coffee
and today's mail."</p>

<p>"Thanks Elaine. If I have anything booked up for today's lunch, cancel or
postpone it."</p>

<p>"Oh? May I ask why?" Elaine's ears became radars on red alert.</p>

<p>"I'm just having dinner... I mean lunch with Ling. No I mean Ling and I
are having 'lunch' with a client." Ally, angry on her self for being so
whimsy. "By the way, I have to talk with her." Ally left her room but
stopped dead at the door, Elaine who had followed her bumped right into her
so that they both fell to the floor. Ally glared at Elaine and said with
the harshest voice she could manage, "And you don't even dare to eavesdrop
on us."</p>

<p>Elaine sighed and smiled at Ally, disappointed she said, "Okay" she then
pointed a finger at Ally and added with a wicked smile, "This is only
because you have been so nice at me lately, consider it a favor." She then
stood up and sat down at her desk and began checking Ally's calendar all
while Ally glared at her wishing looks could kill.</p>

<p>Ally stood up, dusted off her suit and walked over to Ling's room. There
she knocked on Ling's door and then waited for the young East Asian woman
to let her inside.</p>

<p>"Come!" she heard a voice from the other side of the door.</p>

<p>Ally hesitated for a moment, then went in and closed the door behind her.
Ling was behind some screens where she was changing her clothes. The
sunlight made the screen partly transparent in the way that Ally could see
Ling's shadow stand out through them. She saw how Ling took her clothes off
and then put on a dress. She imagined her eyes growing to two big saucers
and it made Ally feel a tingle she had felt before deep inside her as she
saw the smooth movements made by the person behind the screens. Looking at
the shadows took up all her attention so she missed what Ling said
completely.</p>

<p>"Uh? What? Sorry, what did you say?" Ally asked Ling.</p>

<p>"What do you want to talk with 'me' about?" Ling repeated, clearly
irritated.</p>

<p>"Uh... yeah... well, how come you have a bar-corporation?" Ally asked
cursing her self for her disability to tell Ling that she wanted to break
the promise they had made to each other.</p>

<p>"What?" Ling seemed even more irritated and Ally was sure she actually
growled at her.</p>

<p>"Eh... I'm just curious. Is there anything you don't own?" Ally
stammered, her cheeks reddening to look like two red tomatoes.</p>

<p>"I inherited them from an uncle." was the simple reply.</p>

<p>"Well when are we supposed to meet with their representative?" Ally
managed to ask still with two red tomatoes instead of her normal cheeks.</p>

<p>"About 11:15 am. I'll come and get you when it's time." Ling responded
not growling at Ally anymore.</p>

<p>Ally could clearly hear the dismissal in the voice and managed a 'thanks',
before she left and went back to her own desk. She heard Ling saying a
"You're welcome" as she stepped out of her office, missing a suspicious
Ling who looked after her from behind the screen.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Ally sat in her office and tried to come up with different strategies to
reduce the taxes when Ling entered her room without announcing herself at
all. She looked absolutely stunning in the short white firm lined cotton
dress.</p>

<p>"We have to leave now. Are you coming?" she asked her body screaming out
impatience</p>

<p>"Oh? I'll be finished soon. Where are we going to eat? I mean meet with
their representative?" Ally could barely take her eyes of Ling. She wanted
to jump out of her chair, declare her undying love for her and kiss her
deeply. Which made her replay the scene all over again.</p>

<p>Ling looked suspiciously at Ally as she repeated, "We will meet her at one
of my bars." It was obvious that Ally had missed her the first time.</p>

<p>"Okay." Ally stirred looking after the papers she needed to bring. She
put them in her briefcase and stood up walking up beside Ling.</p>

<p>"I'll drive." Ling said with her ice-queen face. They walked out of
Ally's office, Ling first of course.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>When they arrived at the bar, Ally noticed it was quite nice holding a
special feeling. They saw a woman about five years older than her or Ling
sitting at the other end of the bar. She was blond with thick locks that
framed her light skinned face. Her lips were small but had a warmth red
glow that made people notice. Her eyes were as blue as the sky and held an
intelligent sparkle. Her cute perfectly sized nose was slightly pointing
upward adding to the entire look of the gorgeous and cute face. Her body
became visible as she stood up to greet Ally and Ling. It was quite tall
and had curves without being overweighed. It was obviously that this woman
scheduled her time to include a lot of training so she could stay in shape.</p>

<p>"She is gorgeous." Ally whispered to Ling as they went over to the table
where she stood waiting for them. She noticed her comment made Ling frown
for a short moment.</p>

<p>Slightly jealous of Ally's comment Ling commented, "She should be since she
was a model before she went into business."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>Ling replied with a sharp, "Yes."</p>

<p>When they reached the table Ling presented Ally to Mia Oskarsson.</p>

<p>"Oskarsson? Where are you from?" Ally asked curious about the strange
name.</p>

<p>"I'm Swedish." Mia replied with a heart-crushing smile.</p>

<p>As they sat down Ally looked around and commented, "I really like this
place. It has something that is different from other bars I have been in."</p>

<p>"Really? That will make my sister happy. She is managing this place." Mia
gave Ally another smile.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but where are the men?" Ally finally noticing what had bothered
her when they had entered the bar.</p>

<p>"Ling! Haven't you told her this is a gay-bar? And that we who run it are
gay people?" Mia shot an angry look at Ling who smiled a wicked grin.</p>

<p>"Sorry Mia. I just wanted to see how she would react when you told her."
Ling looked at Ally who had frozen with her mouth wide open. She grinned
deviously on Ally who after a short moment managed to knock her out of her
own paralysis still feeling like she would explode like an old steam
engine.</p>

<p>"I... I'm so sorry for my reaction." She managed to say after several
seconds. To afraid to offend the lesbian woman to even try to say anything
else.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be sorry. We are used to it." Mia replied with a slightly
tired face.</p>

<p>"I... Are you gay?" Ally managed not to look too curious as she asked
Mia.</p>

<p>"Yes I am. Have been since I was 22, when I met my first girlfriend." Mia
said preparing for the normal flow of questions that she usually got from
those who didn't know from the beginning that she was gay.</p>

<p>"First?"</p>

<p>Surprised at the different question Mia replied, "Yes, I have had three
others since then but none at the moment."</p>

<p>"Oh..." Ally wondered if Mia could help her with her own feelings for
Ling.</p>

<p>After some quiet minutes the lunch went on without any other interruptions
and at the end they had come up with a working strategy for how to lower
the corporation's taxes.</p>

<p>When Ally excused herself and left for the restroom Mia asked Ling, "Is
Ally gay or something?"</p>

<p>"No. She is definitely straight." Ling responded.</p>

<p>"You're sure?" Mia's eyes displaying doubt. "She didn't react the same
way as other straight people do when they find out."</p>

<p>"Well... We kind of experimented some weeks ago." Ling thought for a
short moment. "We had dinner, danced and then the day after we kissed."
Blushing slightly she added, "When we danced, it really turned me on.
Probably because we teased a group of guys who had watched us while ate."</p>

<p>"You? You are the straightest person I know. Did you really kiss her?"
Mia amused of Ling's confession continued with an interested look in her
eyes, "How did it feel?"</p>

<p>Ling looked back at Mia with a look of both longing and abhorrence, she
then leant forward and whispered in her ear, "Let me say... Unfortunately
it was good enough to make me want to rip off her clothes. We actually
kissed twice."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you do it? I mean ripped off her clothes." Mia not believing
that her friend would even admit something like that.</p>

<p>Ling looked at Mia with a disgusted look. "I'm not gay!" she exclaimed with
a loud voice dragging attention from women around the bar. "No offense."
she added after a short while actually afraid she had hurt her friend.</p>

<p>"None taken." Mia who knew how Ling could be shrugged it off. "But that
doesn't mean that she is straight."</p>

<p>"Oh, later when we talked about it I told her that even though I liked
the kiss, I need a penis and she agreed with me." Ling got a superior look
as she added, "Does that make her gay?" having a soft look she then added,
"Besides, we promised each other to not share any real kisses with any
other women ever..."</p>

<p>Before Mia could say anything Ally returned and they all stood up.</p>

<p>As they walked out of the bar Ally looked hesitantly at Mia. "What... Eh,
Mia, what are you doing to night?"</p>

<p>Surprised at her question Mia managed to barely reply, "Uh, nothing
particular."</p>

<p>"Than we can fix these details to night then?" Ally added with a shy
smile, "Maybe have dinner afterwards." Realizing what she just said her
smile disappeared. But as she blushed bright red she didn't say anything to
correct it. She cursed herself for implying something else than just a
dinner.</p>

<p>"Uhuh, sure." Mia looked at Ling with a look of triumph and said, "When?"</p>

<p>"Shall we say six p.m., at my... office?" Ally's lips turned into a
plastic smile reminding of Biscuit's smile therapy.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'll be there." Mia returned the smile not noticing how false it
was and waved them goodbye.</p>

<p>On the way back to the office Ally on how to not offend Mia later, missed
completely Ling's pale face and infuriated looks shot at her. When they
entered the office, Ally walked into her room and didn't even notice Ling
who followed closely behind her.</p>

<p>Ling closed the door and locked it. "What the hell was that?" she said
almost screaming.</p>

<p>"What?" Ally looked up into two burning eyes.</p>

<p>"You're not gay, why are you going to date her then?" Ling continued
still with a loud voice.</p>

<p>Ally worried that Ling's voice was heard through the door replied with a
low voice, "You hate me so why would you even care?" feeling slightly
irritated she added, "I might even brake the promise we gave each other."
To late seeing how hurt Ling had become of her statement she regretted what
she said.</p>

<p>Ling who had let her ice-queen manner replaced her earlier infuriated look.
"If that's the way you want it. I don't wish you luck." she said with a low
voice before she with her normal cool style walked out of Ally's room.</p>

<p>Ally looked after Ling with a longing look wishing things were very much
different but couldn't make herself do anything about it.</p>

<p>Moments after Ling had walked out, Elaine walked in with her curios eyes
and ears at red alert. "What did you two fight about?"</p>

<p>"Out!" was the only reply Elaine got.</p>

<p>"I heard something about a date..." Elaine continued hoping to make Ally
revel something by mistake.</p>

<p>"Like I would ever tell you! I said OUT!" Ally growled at Elaine.</p>

<p>Elaine turning around and quietly adding, "Snappish now again, and who was
so nice to her today."</p>

<p>"I heard that!" screamed Ally at her as she followed her and closed the
door with a huge slam after Elaine.</p>

<p>Elaine pretending that nothing happened smiled at her co-workers sat down
at her desk answering the phone.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Fifteen minutes before six, Ally watched the wristwatch nervously. She was
afraid that Mia wouldn't show up. Thinking that she should explain to Mia
what she really meant when she offered dinner. She also felt curious to how
it would really feel like, having a 'date' with someone with her own sex.
She had thought about it for almost the entire afternoon and finally
decided to have a dinner with Mia treating it like a date, besides it
couldn't hurt that much right? She could always say they didn't fit
together if it worked out in wrong direction.</p>

<p>Two minutes before six, Mia knocked at Ally's door nervous and afraid that
Ally hadn't meant the dinner as an offer of a date. She hadn't been dating
at all for almost six months...</p>

<p>Ally heard a knock on her door and realized that it probably was Mia.
Swallowing nervously she said, "Come in!" smiling nervously at the door.</p>

<p>"Eh... Hi." Mia managed to say. She had changed into a short black dress
that followed her lines without leaning tight against her skin.</p>

<p>Ally couldn't even open her mouth, well it was open already. After a long
moment of simply staring at each other Ally dropped her pen just to get an
excuse for breaking eye contact. She ducked below her desk hearing her
heart beating like church-bells, imagining Mia hearing it. Cursing herself
for having feelings that was not suitable for the situation. "I'm having
feelings for Ling, her. Soon I'm  horny on everyone!" she cursed to herself
quietly.</p>

<p>"Eh... Did you say anything?" Mia heard Ally mumbling something about
Ling.</p>

<p>"Oh... Nothing... Well, I cursed myself for being so clumsy." Ally tried
to smile herself to confidence but didn't convince either herself or Mia.
Mia shrugged it off as nervousness, she guessed quite accurately that Ally
never had been on a date with a woman before. </p>

<p>Remembering that she had forgotten to greet Mia, Ally blushed and
stammered, "H... Hello..." Uncertain if she should take her hand or hug her
she simply stood there and waited for Mia to react. After some uneasy
moments they shook hands and Ally said, "Ehm... Pardon me for my lack of
hospitality, please sit down." Ally blushed slightly of embarrassment as
she mentioned the chair in front of her desk.</p>

<p>Mia sat down and Ally gave her some papers. "These are some suggestions on
what we can do." Ally said while Mia skimmed through the papers.</p>

<p>Mia returned the papers when she was finished and said, "Shall we go?"</p>

<p>"Huh?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure all these ideas are good, but I don't really feel like working to
night." she smiled at Ally with one of her ice melting smiles and added,
"So, where are you going to take me?"</p>

<p>"Ehm... To bed, no reg..." Ally took a deep breath trying not to return
Mia's amused smile. "To a place some blocks down the street." she finally
managed to say.</p>

<p>Giving away a short laugh Mia said, "Have anyone ever told you that you are
really funny?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, many people. Thanks for the compliment. You look goreg..." Ally
cut herself off before she said something she would regret later.</p>

<p>Mia did hear it though and understood what Ally almost had said. "Thank
you." she said, smiling at Ally she continued, "You look great too."</p>

<p>Ally blushed and stammered some thanks, looking away.</p>

<p>Trying to make Ally feel a bit more at ease Mia said, "Let's go, I'm
starving."</p>

<p>Ally agreed and they left for the dinner.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>At the restaurant Ally felt at the beginning, it all was just a reply of
what had occurred with Ling.</p>

<p>"So, you became gay when you were 22, right?" Ally said to break the
silence.</p>

<p>"Um... Yes, actually I think I have been all my life but didn't realize
it until I was 22." Mia explained, feeling grateful that Ally had finally
broken the silence.</p>

<p>"Could you explain it with a bit more... details?" Ally hesitated afraid
to offend Mia.</p>

<p>"Well... In high school, I dated only three guys, and I never really felt
anything for them. Nothing like I did with my first girlfriend."</p>

<p>"Three guys? That's more than I did. I had one long relationship with
Billy until the second year at college." Ally interrupted.</p>

<p>"I never went to college until after I had done some modeling. Actually I
modeled to pay for my college studies."</p>

<p>"Did you make lot of money modeling?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I still had to live in a dorm. But I don't regret it since it
was there I met my first girlfriend."</p>

<p>"How?" Ally became really curious. Not being able to hide it she noticed
that Mia seemed to be amused.</p>

<p>"She was a student prefect and we shared room." thinking back at her
college time Mia continued, "There was this guy who refused to leave me
alone. He almost stalked me. I complained to her and one day when she and I
sat in the park outside the student's union building, he came up and began
trying to convince me to go out with him. Then right there she kissed me."
smiling at the memory she looked at Ally who seemed lost in thoughts.
"Hello?" Mia said waving her hand in front of Ally. "Are you listening?"</p>

<p>"Oh... yeah, please go on." Ally tried unsuccessfully not blushing.</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly what she told him because I was completely caught
up in digesting the kiss. Anyway he seemed a bit confused but it really
made him stop pursuing me. I didn't talk with her for an entire week. and
then I tried to stay away from her as much as I could."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I don't even know why. I simply felt uncomfortable with her."</p>

<p>"Uncomfortable? why uncomfortable?"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't exactly feel uncomfortable." Mia got a dreamy look. "It
was actually something I never really felt before, so I misunderstood it
for un-comfort."</p>

<p>"Oh... I see. I have done that a lot of times even with feelings I have
had before." Ally nodded in understanding what Mia meant.</p>

<p>Mia continued, "Eventually she got tired of it since we were room mates and
confronted me. I confessed that I had liked our kiss and then she asked if
I would like to kiss her again. I said yes and we did it again, and again,
and again. We made out for about an hour before we parted and she told me
she was in love with me. She had been since the first time she had met me."
Mia continued to tell Ally about her first experiences with her first
girlfriend. She was surprised at how easy she revealed her past for Ally
who listened at her intently. Her curiosity shining through her eyes.</p>

<p>When Mia was finished she looked at Ally and said, "So how come you are a
lawyer?"</p>

<p>Seeming a bit embarrassed Ally replied, "Well, actually I became a lawyer
because of my ex-boyfriend Billy. He wanted to study law and I who wanted
to be with him choose law to."</p>

<p>"Really? Just because you wanted to be with him?" Mia didn't believe her
first.</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm not that proud about that, but I found that law did suit me
nicely so I continued and became a lawyer." Looking a bit sad Ally
continued, "We stayed together for the first year then he choose to move to
Chicago and I to stay here in Boston."</p>

<p>"That sounds sad. Did it take you long time to get over him?"</p>

<p>"Mmm... I don't think I'm really completely over him yet, but I do know
one thing." Ally smiled at Mia. "I am not attracted to him anymore. Not
that he isn't a good looking guy."</p>

<p>"Anymore? You've met him again?"</p>

<p>"We and his wife work at the same firm."</p>

<p>Mia's jaw dropped to the floor. "You're kiddin'!"</p>

<p>"No I'm not. We work really well together." Ally slightly amused.
"Georgia and I are quite good friends too."</p>

<p>"Oh? Is she a good looking woman?" Mia sounded curious.</p>

<p>Looking back at Mia, Ally got a sheepish look. "I have only one word for
her, gorgeous. She is absolutely gorgeous."</p>

<p>Mia smiled at Ally's dreamy face. Before she could say anything, Ally
pointed in the direction of the bar.</p>

<p>"Look at those guys!" she exclaimed with a hushed voice, leaning over
towards Mia.</p>

<p>Mia looked over her shoulder and saw a group of guys standing at the bar
looking at her and Ally. "Uhuh? What about them?" Mia asked with little
interest.</p>

<p>"I don't know if Ling have told you anything about our dinner. That we
had here." Ally explained.</p>

<p>"Ahh... It's those guys." Mia smiled as she remembered what Ling had told
her earlier.</p>

<p>"Care to do it with me?" Ally's eyes shined of mischievous as she asked
her dinner partner.</p>

<p>"I don't see the meaning to tease them." Mia shrugged. "If we had been at
my sisters place, I would have had said yes right away. But here..." Mia
seemed to think it over. "No. I don't think so."</p>

<p>"Oh... Do you like to just dance then?" Ally asked, her disappointment
showing through.</p>

<p>"Well... That sounds like a nice idea though, shall we?" Mia replied as
she stood up and offered Ally her arm.</p>

<p>Smiling, Ally took it and let Mia lead her out on the dance-floor just
below their table. The band played some kind of slow pop/samba mixture easy
to dance to. After only some minutes had the world disappeared around them
and all they saw was eachother. Not noticing the looks they attracted from
everyone around the dance-floor. They continued to dance even after the
song had ended and didn't stop until after the third song which was a
ballad. Then they simply stood there lost in eachother's eyes. Hesitantly
Mia began to move her mouth against Ally's but her lips only brushed them
briefly before Ally, blushing broke contact and went back to the table.</p>

<p>Mia hurrying after her looking both hurt and disappointed, sat down in
front of Ally. "I'm so sorry." she said not feeling sorry at all.</p>

<p>"Ehm... No. I am the one who should be sorry." Ally replied her blood
vessels in her cheeks filled with warm red blood. "I... I can't do it. I'm
sorry. It's not because I'm straight or not attracted to you..."</p>

<p>"You are?" Mia asked realizing the 'date' was going to end soon.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am. But... I... Am..." Ally not able to look Mia in her eyes, let
her gaze trail off and landed on a pair of dark almost black eyes returning
her gaze with a cool iciness. Recognizing them as belonging to the item of
her love Ally got mad and she did something she immediately regretted.
"What the hell... You only live once." she said and kissed Mia right in
front of everyone in the restaurant.</p>

<p>Mia had closed her eyes while the kiss lasted and then slowly opened them
looking at Ally. "Wow." she said smiling weakly. "You really are a good
kisser."</p>

<p>Returning her smile, Ally looked at Mia while sealing her anger. "Would you
like to come with me to my apartment and drink some coffee?" she then asked
cursing herself for making another mistake. She hoped that Mia would turn
down her offer but saw that it would not happen.</p>

<p>"Sorry, I don't drink coffee. I prefer tea. But I could do an exception
if you like." Mia answered. Hoping maybe something else would also occur.</p>

<p>"Oh... Tea is fine too." Ally answered. They stood up, Ally left money to
pay the receipt and then they left. Outside the restaurant Mia held out her
hand, waiting to see if Ally would take it. After some hesitation Ally
grabbed it, she was surprised at how nice and gentle it felt as they went
off in silence.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>  "Do you have anything with it?" Ally asked as she poured tea in two cups.</p>

<p>"No. just plain tea thanks." Mia replied. After they had entered Ally's
apartment, Ally had kept a certain distance between them making Mia feel
that Ally wasn't interested in anything more than friendship.</p>

<p>As they sat there in awkwardness the door opened and Renee came in. Ally
jumped up from the couch and looked guilty at Renee as she saw them there
in surprise. Mia looked at the beautiful black woman who stood in front of
them.</p>

<p>"Eh... Renee this is Mia Oskar..." Ally looked at Mia unsure on how to
pronounce her surname.</p>

<p>"Oskarsson." Mia helped.</p>

<p>"Mia this is Renee, my roommate." Ally said presenting them for
eachother.</p>

<p>Renee stepped forward as Mia stood up. "Nice to see you... Mia." Renee said
with one of her pleasant smiles as they shook hands.</p>

<p>Mia returned the smile liking the woman instantly and said, "It's nice to
meet you to."</p>

<p>After a long discomforted minute, Mia looked at Ally and said, "Maybe I
should go home now."</p>

<p>Looking back with a regretful face Ally replied, "Yeah, maybe it's best
that way."</p>

<p>Mia went for her coat and put it on as she stood before the door. "It was a
nice dinner. Maybe... We could do it again?" she said as she hugged Ally.</p>

<p>"Mmm... We should really do it again..." Ally answered, she hesitated
before she added, "But only as friends."</p>

<p>Mia got a disappointed look as she realized that Ally didn't want anything
serious with her. She nodded and repeated, "Okey... as friends. Call me."</p>

<p>"I will." Ally replied, she smiled relieved that Mia didn't hate her for
implying something else than friendship.</p>

<p>In the gangway down to the outer door Mia sighed, disappointed but she
tried to cheer herself up by admitting that she at least had been on a
date. The first date for a long time.</p>

<p>When Ally had closed the door behind Mia, Renee steps up next to her
looking interested on her roommate. Ally noticed her curiosity and prepared
herself on an interrogation.</p>

<p>"So. Who was she?" Renee asked smiling.</p>

<p>"A friend." Ally smiled back.</p>

<p>"A friend that you had dinner with?" Renee looked at Ally with a mock
suspicious look. "Not a date?"</p>

<p>"Yes just a simple dinner!" Ally exclaimed irritation expressed on her
entire body. Renee gave her the look she always gave when she didn't
believe her. "Okay..." Ally confessed. "It was kind of a date-dinner,
dinner-date. Whatever you want to call it." she continued waving her arms
around in the air.</p>

<p>"Aha. Was it good?" Renee continued her merciless questioning.</p>

<p>"Yeah... I would probably had sex with her if you hadn't come home." Ally
replied quietly.</p>

<p>"And that would have been wrong?" Renee asked afraid the answer would be
no.</p>

<p>"Yes. I don't love her. I was just interested in her body." Ally said,
still with a low voice. "Besides I'm in love with someone else so I would
have felt that I betrayed her."</p>

<p>"So you really are gay?" Renee said as she sat down beside Ally.</p>

<p>"What's that suppose to mean? don't you want me to be gay or what?" Ally
said anger flashing through her eyes.</p>

<p>"Uh... No. I'm just a bit shocked, I thought it was just some fantasy of
yours." Renee defended herself.</p>

<p>"You mean you wanted it to be one of my fantasies right?" Ally asked
miserably filling her as she heard how her best friend rejected her
feelings as mere fantasies.</p>

<p>"Yes.." Renee said after a long moment of silence.</p>

<p>"Maybe it is just one of my fantasies... I don't really know. It happened
so quickly. One minute I had never thought about it. Then in the next, I
thought about it almost all the time." Ally shook her head almost crying.</p>

<p>Renee closed her arms around Ally in a soothing motion and said, "Well,
whatever you choose to be I will always be here for you." smiling Renee
continued with a teasing tone, "But don't expect me to have sex with you."</p>

<p>"Renee!" Ally exclaimed, looking angry on her friend. "why on earth would
I want to have sex with you?" she then asked.</p>

<p>"I was just joking." Renee replied very amused.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I know." Ally said looking sad. The look disappeared as her lips
cracked up into a smile.</p>

<p>"That's the way you should look." Renee said pleased her little joke had
made Ally smile.</p>

<p>Renee looked at her watch. "It's late, I think I'm going off to bed. I'm
meeting a potential client early tomorrow."</p>

<p>"It's best I do it too."</p>

<p>"Are you fine then?"</p>

<p>"I'm doing okay. Nothing different from other days." Ally replied,
smiling a weak smile to reinsure Renee that she was ok.</p>

<p>"Okay, sleep well."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Ally walked into her office, only to discover Ling there wrapped up in
Mia's arms. "We don't really need that fake-gay bitch" Ling said after she
and Mia broke their kiss.</p>

<p>"Yeah. I tried to be nice at her, and what did it give me? Just a simple
fucking, 'I just wanna be friends'!" Mia replied with a bad imitation of
Ally.</p>

<p>"Hey! What is this?" Ally asked looking crestfallen at Ling.</p>

<p>Ling looked back at Ally with a wicked grin. "This is what you get for
cheating on me."</p>

<p>With a scream Ally woke up her body dripped of sweat.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Renee came hurriedly in Ally's bedroom, looking almost
afraid.</p>

<p>Ally looked at Renee and began to cry. Renee walked over to Ally and tried
to comfort her as best as she could.</p>

<p>"I... I h... Had such a nightmare." Ally managed to say between her sobs.</p>

<p>"What was it about?" </p>

<p>"I walked into my office and right there Ling made out with Mia. They
talked about me and how evil I was. When I asked what they were doing, Ling
responded that it was payback for cheating on her." Ally told Renee about
the dream with long pauses while she told it.</p>

<p>"And why was it so horrible?" Renee asked not really understanding what
in the dream was so bad.</p>

<p>"Her eyes when she looked at me." Ally explained. "They accused me for
not loving her." Ally blew her nose. "She hates me..."</p>

<p>"Why would she do that?"</p>

<p>"Because she saw us at the restaurant." Ally replied.</p>

<p>"She spied on you?" Renee asked shocked. Not believing ice-queen Ling
would ever do such a thing as spy on Ally.</p>

<p>"Yes... She was there. A... And when I saw her I got angry and revenged
on her by kissing Mia. Poor Mia. I hope she isn't angry on me for using
her." Ally said as she began to sob again.</p>

<p>"You... Kissed Mia?" Renee asked half in surprise half in chock.</p>

<p>"Yeah... It was actually the best kiss I've had for a long time." Ally
confessed. "Well except the one with Ling, of course."</p>

<p>"I must get used to this I think." Renee finally said shaking her head in
disbelief.</p>

<p>Finally finished with her crying Ally asked, "What time is it?"</p>

<p>"Time to go up and get ready for work." Renee replied as she went for the
bathroom.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>As soon as Ally stepped out of the elevator she noticed how everyone was
staring at her. Frowning she went into her office almost expecting to see
what she had dreamt about. The people at Cage/Fish and Associates Law firm
remembered the scene that had happened only minutes before Ally had entered
the firm office. Richard had asked Ling something and Ling had replied with
an angry screaming voice, "Don't ever mention ms McBeal's name for me
again! Or I will rip your damn tongue out!" She then hurried back into her
office and closing the door with a hard slam. Leaving Richard lost of
words.</p>

<p>Elaine approached Richard after Ling had left him. "What did you ask her?"
she asked hoping for some juicy gossip.</p>

<p>"I just asked her if she knew where Ally had been last night since she
weren't either here or at the pub." Richard said with a puzzled look.</p>

<p>"They were having an argument yesterday after their lunch with that
representative." Elaine said.</p>

<p>"Did you hear about what?" Richard asked now really interested.</p>

<p>"No, just something about a date Ally would have with the
representative." Elaine said with a disappointed look.</p>

<p>Before Richard could continue the conversation, Ally came out of the
elevator making everyone looking at her. She seemed not to really notice it
and went for her office immediately barely greeting the others.</p>

<p>As soon she had closed her door, Ling came out of her room and went
straight for Ally's office. Closing it as she went in without knocking.
Elaine and Richard almost run down to eavesdrop on them.</p>

<p>Ally looked up into two diamond hard eyes dark as two opals when she heard
someone entered her office. Bracing herself for the other woman's words she
said, "Yes, can I help you?"</p>

<p>Giving Ally a fake smile Ling said, "And how was Mia in bed?" giving Ally
another plastic smile. "I hope you didn't enjoyed it at all."</p>

<p>"We didn't do anything. All we did was having a dinner, dancing..."</p>

<p>"Dancing! You call that dancing?!" Ling screamed out, her body screaming
out anger. "You two practically fucked right there on the dance-floor while
everyone was looking!" she continued with the same infuriated tone.</p>

<p>"We were just dancing." Ally replied between clenched teeth. "Who gave
you the right to spy on us anyway." she added, her voice raising to the
same level as Lings.</p>

<p>"You threw away our promise!" Ling countered, ignoring Ally's accusation.</p>

<p>"So what?!" Ally now stood in front of Ling, reaching some inches higher
over the angry Asian woman. "You have no right to decide who I'm dating or
kissing or having sex with. Gee, who do you think you are? My wife?" Ally
continued. "We kissed once! Hell, that kiss didn't mean shit.</p>

<p>When she finally had to stop to breath, Ling simply looked at her. "You
don't even comprehend how much I hate you right now." was all she said
before she left the room. When she opened the door she discovered that
Elaine and Richard had eavesdropped on them. She punched Richard right in
the stomach making him bend over grasping for air, while Elaine was fast
enough to get out of reach from Ling's fist. Ling then went for the
elevator leaving the office.</p>

<p>Ally who had followed her to her own office door regretted every word she
had said to Ling. She wished that Ling wouldn't make her so angry. Noticing
that Ling left without her coat she hurried over to Lings room and
retrieved it and then went to the elevator only stopping to have enough
time to kick Richard in the bottom and give Elaine a threatening look. She
soon disappeared as the elevator doors closed.</p>

<p>Elaine went quickly over to Richard to see how he was. Still grasping for
air he managed to gasp out, "What the hell is it with those two?"</p>

<p>Elaine thought for a short moment and were just going to spill it she
shrugged it off, but then decided to share it anyway. "I think they are in
love."</p>

<p>Richard began to laugh but stopped since it hurt too much. "Yeah right.
Maybe Ally is in love with Ling but Ling is as straight as you and me." he
said after a long series of coughs and trying to get air.</p>

<p>"Yeah but they do act strange..."</p>

<p>Billy and Georgia came up beside them as did Nelle and John.</p>

<p>"What happened?" Billy asked as he looked down on Richard who still
hadn't stood up.</p>

<p>"Ling knocked him down and then went away somewhere in the elevator.
Shortly Ally followed her." Elaine summed it all up.</p>

<p>"Nelle, do you know what's wrong with them?" John asked turning to her.</p>

<p>"Nope." Nelle answered. "Ling haven't told me anything. Well... Except
that she had a dream where she kissed Ally." Nelle looked at the others.
"She came to me and asked if she was gay because of the dream." Nelle got
an amused look as she continued, "I told her that she of course wasn't gay
because of that, that it was a normal fantasy. Anyway later they had dinner
and then the day after they kissed in Ally's office. She didn't tell me any
details but I think she really liked the kiss."</p>

<p>"They... They kissed?" Richard managed to blurt out. He was so shocked
that he forgot he was hurt and stood up, making him wince over and fall to
the floor once again.</p>

<p>"You're kidding." Billy exclaimed, looking surprised at Nelle.</p>

<p>"No I'm not."</p>

<p>"What? When? How could I miss that?" Elaine blurted out angry she had
missed such an important gossip.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Ally looked at both directions before she spotted Ling walking down the
street. She hurried after her and was soon at her side. She held out the
coat and said, "You forgot this."</p>

<p>Ling ignored her even though it was clear that she was freezing.</p>

<p>"Take the damn coat!" Ally exclaimed irritated as she showed it right in
the arms of Ling.</p>

<p>"Why?" Ling asked looking at her.</p>

<p>"It's cold out here." Ally replied trying to not sound too concerned.</p>

<p>"I meant, why do you care?" Ling explained with a soft voice, not like
her at all.</p>

<p>"Because I do... I do care about you." Ally answered, her voice as soft
as Ling's. "What ever I say or do I always care about you." she continued.</p>

<p>"Even when you date others and have sex with them?"</p>

<p>"What? I didn't have any sex with Mia!" realizing she was screaming Ally
continued in a lower tone, "You don't have any right to tell me who I am
dating or having sex with. We have both dated since our kiss."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but they were just guys. Now it was a girl."</p>

<p>"Does that really matter to you?" Ally was surprised.</p>

<p>"Yes it does. Before I was the only woman you had really kissed. I was
special to you. Now I'm not just someone you'll forget." Ling explained,
her voice barely audible.</p>

<p>"You want me to feel you are special?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Ally stepped forward and closed the space between them and hugged ling
tightly. "You are special for me..." she said.</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Ally replied as she began to kiss Ling.</p>

<p>Ling broke contact immediately. "What are you doing?" she asked frowning at
Ally.</p>

<p>"I... I..." Ally couldn't say a word surprised at Lings reaction.</p>

<p>"Why were you trying to kiss me? I don't want to kiss you." Ling
continued angry eyes looking at Ally.</p>

<p>Ally looked at Ling with surprise then suddenly blurted out, "You damn
bitch you were just playing with me! Go to hell!" she began to walk back to
her office.</p>

<p>Taken aback by Ally's words Ling simply stood and watched her walk away.
Several moments passed before she hurried after her screaming, "You haven't
answered my question!" which only made Ally go faster. "Damn it! I have
right to an answer!" Ling continued, being completely ignored by Ally.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>  "Let's call Renee and ask." Elaine said as they all had come to a dead
end in their musings. They al agreed and Elaine picked up her phone and
pushed the number to Renee's office. After a short moment Renee answered.</p>

<p>"Renee? Hi it's Elaine." Elaine could hear a sigh as Renee answered.
"Well, we... I wonder if Ally was on a date last night." Elaine listened in
the phone and nodded slightly. "Okay, thanks." she looked up after she
hanged up the phone. "Yes she was on a date last night but not with Ling,
as you thought Richard. She was having a dinner with that representative
and apparently Ling spied on them." Elaine continued.</p>

<p>"Why would Ling spy on Ally when she had dinner with some accountant guy?"
Georgia asked.</p>

<p>"It wasn't a guy." Elaine said with a smile.</p>

<p>"No way she is gay!" Billy exclaimed. Not believing his childhood love
would be gay. His statement resulted in a glare from Georgia.</p>

<p>Before they could continue, Ally stepped out of the elevator with a
screaming Ling right behind her. Not noticing the crowd standing outside
her door she stepped in and closed it right in front of Ling whom
immediately opened it and went in.</p>

<p>"Answer me!" they could hear her scream. "I am not playing with you for
god sake!"</p>

<p>"Please leave my office." Ally replied her lips forming a small straight
line.</p>

<p>Ling looked at her a long moment. "Okay, I'm leaving but this is all your
fault." she accused Ally as she walked out of the room. Ignoring her and
Ally's co-workers.</p>

<p>Ally screamed after her, "Yeah, blame me for everything you BITCH!"</p>

<p>Billy showed a frightened face in Ally's door and looked at her. "Ally is
everything fine?" he stammered.</p>

<p>"Yeah, everything's just fine." Ally replied with a sneer. "Ling and I have
just a small disagreement." she continued still wearing an irritated sneer.</p>

<p>"If there is anything me or Georgia can do for you, just tell us ok?"
Billy said intimidated of Ally's mode.</p>

<p>Ally looked at him with a sudden serious face. "Yes you and Georgia can go
and be more with your daughter than be here. She needs you more than the
firm does."</p>

<p>Surprised at her comment Billy simply nodded and disappeared.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>  "So you mean you're gay?" Tracy asked for the third time.</p>

<p>"Yes!" Ally looked at her irritation fuming out of her ears. "Is it hard
for you to get it or what?"</p>

<p>"Gee, no wonder you have had such problems with guys." Tracy continued
not listening on Ally.</p>

<p>"What?" Ally almost shocked of hearing Tracy's comment.</p>

<p>"Oh... What did you say?" Tracy said shrugging off her thoughts. "So
basically you and this Ling that you told me about a couple of weeks ago
had this big fight and now you're convinced that she hates you?" Tracy
asked looking unsure if she had heard right.</p>

<p>"Basically yes."</p>

<p>"And that is because?"</p>

<p>"She just played with me." Ally blurted out.</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes! She made me believe she was in love with me too." Ally explained
irritation filling her like a bottle being filled with fluid.</p>

<p>"Did she tell you right out that she was in love with you?" Tracy asked
already guessing the answer.</p>

<p>"No, but she acted like..." Ally began to answer but was cut of by Tracy.</p>

<p>"Acted like you do when you are in love, right?"</p>

<p>Ally looked down. "Yes." she replied with a barely audible voice.</p>

<p>"Look if you ask her, you will at least know how she feels." Tracy said.
"I would of course prefer to see you both." she added.</p>

<p>"How? She won't even talk to me."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it you who refused to talk to her?"</p>

<p>"Eh... Yeah." Ally blushed.</p>

<p>"Then if I am going to be able to help you, I have to see you both and
talk to you." Tracy said looking at her watch she added, "Well then your
hour has ended. Bring Ling with you for next session."</p>

<p>Ally replied with a weak, "Sure."</p>

<p>After Ally had left the room Tracy took up a Dictaphone. "For later notes,
the main problem with ms. McBeal is her way of not confronting her emotions
with her surroundings, have not decreased as I hoped it would. It is more
likely the opposite. If she is homosexual, maybe coming out will help her
with her real problems."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>The office of Cage/Fish and Associates Law firm held a low mode. Everything
seemed to be affected of the agitation existing between Ally and Ling. Ally
did of course not bring Ling with her to her next session with Tracy.
finally Richard and John got tired of their hostility to eachother and
asked them to join them in the conference room.</p>

<p>Ally stepped into the conference room seeing Richard and John sitting
there. She sat down in a chair and asked, "So what do you want to talk
about?"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute." was the only reply she got. She noticed how serious they
both were.</p>

<p>After some moments the door opened and Ling walked in. Seeing Ally she
stopped and began to turn but was hindered by Richard.</p>

<p>"We must talk with you two." Richard said as he forced Ling to sit down
beside Ally. Ling surprised at Richard's aggressive mode didn't resist.</p>

<p>"You two will make peace to the extent that it won't affect your job."
John said his voice stern and angry.</p>

<p>"You two have caused us to loose three clients and one potential client."
Richard continued, he also sounded as stern as John had.</p>

<p>"So if you want to work on this firm. You will have to become 'friends'."
John added his face barely moving.</p>

<p>"What? But I." Ally was cut off by Richard.</p>

<p>"Shut up." Richard said. "You two will leave now and not come back until
you have solved what you are fighting about." he continued and pointed at
the door. "I want you to know that we do care about you two but if this
firm is going to survive we can't have you two pushing the mode down to
china."</p>

<p>"By the way Ally. Tracy want's to see you she asked me to tell you that
it is not a good idea to stop seeing once shrink." John said as he looked
after them when they left the room.</p>

<p>"I will." Ally answered blushing, ashamed that Tracy had told John that
she had stopped seeing her.</p>

<p>"You can take my hour to day if you want to."</p>

<p>"Thanks I will." Ally looked at Ling. "She wants to see you too. So why
not come with me?" she added almost afraid Ling would turn her down.</p>

<p>"Guess I have no choice if I want to work here." Ling said with a sulky
tone.</p>

<p>"Good luck!" Richard called as they closed the door.</p>

<p>When they had stepped out of the conference room they stood still waiting
for the other to make a move. Finally Ally broke the silence. "I... I have
to get my stuff first. See you at the elevator?"</p>

<p>"Sure." Ling still seemed to be sulky.</p>

<p>When Ally walked out of her office, Ling stood at the elevator seeming
impatient as she normally was. Her sulkiness gone replaced with her cool
surface.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>  "I'm not gay!" Ling blurted out for the fifth time.</p>

<p>"You sure made me believe you were in LOVE with me." Ally replied angry
and hurt by what Ling stated.</p>

<p>"Stop!" Tracy screamed to be heard over the two women who were
practically screaming. "You sit down!" she ordered Ling who sat down at the
opposite side of the couch from Ally.</p>

<p>"It's still your fault." Ling muttered looking angrily at Ally.</p>

<p>"Why is it all her fault?" Tracy asked as she looked at Ling with a
serious look.</p>

<p>"If I hadn't dreamt about kissing her, all this wouldn't have happened."
Ling exclaimed exasperated.</p>

<p>"If you had forgotten the dream. We would have been all fine to."</p>

<p>"You are quiet." Tracy said with a stern voice at Ally. She then
continued, "Can you please tell the entire story from the beginning?"</p>

<p>"Okay, it all started..." Ling trailed off telling the entire story with
some interjections by Ally. "... So then she asks Mia out on a date. I
don't know why, but it bugs me. When Mia come to the office I decide to
follow them and eat at the same place as thy do." Ling noticed the look she
got from both Ally and Tracy. "Okay, I decided to spy on you." she
confessed. "Anyway, then they leave the restaurant and go home to her."
Ling nodded in Ally's direction. "I assume they had sex but I don't know
since I didn't stay." she was interrupted by Ally.</p>

<p>"We did not have sex!" Ally looked annoyed at Ling. "She left shortly
after we had drank a cup of tea."</p>

<p>"Yeah, right! You're a sex-monster." Ling replied not believing Ally.</p>

<p>"I'm not a sex-monster!" Ally denied screaming at Ling.</p>

<p>Ling stood up her impatience showing all over her body. "This won't help a
shit." she stated and then left the room.</p>

<p>"Come back here! We're not finished yet!" Ally screamed after her.</p>

<p>Tracy looked at her wristwatch. "Actually Ally, John's time has ended and I
must prepare for my next patient."</p>

<p>"Oh... Okay. I see you on Thursday then." Ally said and gathered hers and
Ling's coats before she left the room.</p>

<p>When Ally had left the room, Tracy opened a drawer and took up Ally's tape.
She put it in the Dictaphone, then noted date and began to talk. "This
person ms. Woo that was with us today seem to be in a serious case of
denial. I would like to have her in private sessions but it seems not as an
option regarding of what kind of personality she has. Hopefully it won't
affect ms. McBeal too much."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Mia sat in her bathtub when the doorbell rang. She thought it was her
sister who forgot her key's again and therefor didn't care to put on a
bathrobe. She walked over to the door and looked out in the peek-glass and
saw Ling standing there. Panicking she grabbed a trenchcoat and hurriedly
put it on herself. "Just wait a moment!" she called out through the door
hoping Ling would wait, knowing how impatient she could be sometimes.</p>

<p>As soon as Mia had opened the door Ling walked in and sat down on the couch
n Mia's livingroom.</p>

<p>"Come in." Mia said not surprised.</p>

<p>Ling looked at Mia and waited for her to follow and sit down beside her.</p>

<p>"So what can I do for you?" Mia asked, curious about what had made Ling
come out here in a late hour.</p>

<p>"I need to talk with you. It's very personal." Ling simply explained.</p>

<p>"Me? Isn't Nelle your best friend?" Mia asked surprised that Ling would
turn to her. They were mostly just friends close but not that close.</p>

<p>"Yes. But this is something I don't think she can help me with." Ling
said not being straight to business anymore.</p>

<p>Mia frowned slightly as she thought what Ling couldn't discuss with Nelle
about. Suddenly realizing what she meant Mia asked, "It's about
homosexuality, right?"</p>

<p>Ling just nodded and blushed making her honey colored skin get a red tone
in them.</p>

<p>"What about it? I thought you knew everything a non gay person can
possibly understand about it."</p>

<p>"Yeah but..." Ling hesitated. Encouraged by Mia she continued, "You have
been in love, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but what has that to do with homosexuality?" Mia replied.</p>

<p>"Well, when you was in love you felt... How am I supposed to describe it?
A tingling sensation inside your stomach?" Ling surprisingly unsure of
herself. Completely the opposite of her natural self.</p>

<p>"Yeah... That kind of fits the description, but there are much more too.
Every time different from the other." Mia answered wondering if Ling was in
love with someone.</p>

<p>Ling swallowed hard and then sighed expressing both disappointment and
pleasantness. "So... I'm really in love with her then..." she stated lost
in thoughts about someone.</p>

<p>"Did you say her?" Mia asked now really curious about the person who held
Ling's affection.</p>

<p>Mia's question dragging Ling back to reality, she replied. "It's Ally."</p>

<p>"Oh... I think she is on love with you..." Mia said knowing her hopes now
was really crushed. There was no way she could get Ally interested in her
now. She didn't want to be a soap-opera bitch either and stop them from
being together either.</p>

<p>"I know... Not anymore though." Ling said her voice low.</p>

<p>"Why? Did she say that she didn't love you anymore?"</p>

<p>"No it was me who told her I didn't love her kind of."</p>

<p>"Oh! And that means she stops love you? Just because someone tells you
that she doesn't love you anymore make you stop loving her. Believe me I
know." Mia said with an irritated voice. Tired of Ling's strange behavior.</p>

<p>Ling looked at Mia with regretful eyes. "I'm so sorry. I forgot that Ann
dumped you." she paused a minute. "That was half a year ago. Do you still
love her?" Ling asked looking attentively at Mia.</p>

<p>"Yes. I still do." Mia replied answering Ling's question.</p>

<p>"She was more a bitch than me. Why did you love her at all?" Ling
commented.</p>

<p>Ling looked at the old wall-clock that showed ten past nine. "I must go."
she said as she stood up.</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>"Well... I want to apologize to Ally and hopefully make up." Ling
explained.</p>

<p>"Okey. Good luck." Mia wished.</p>

<p>"Will you be okay?" Ling asked looking at her friend.</p>

<p>"Yeah... I will just drown my sorrows in a bottle of whiskey and old
romantic movies." Mia replied with a weak smile.</p>

<p>"You could try sleep it off instead." Ling suggested.</p>

<p>"Well, I will need the whiskey as soporific. My sis will put me to bed if
I fall to sleep here on the couch." Mia said her mode decreasing.</p>

<p>"Maybe I should talk to Ally tomorrow." Ling said thinking she should
stay with Mia.</p>

<p>"No! Go now. Tomorrow could be to late." Mia said her voice sounding like
steel. "I said I will be fine. Now go!"</p>

<p>"Okay. See you on Friday then?" Ling asked as she walked towards the
apartment door.</p>

<p>"Yeah we do that." Mia replied.</p>

<p>Ling looked back a final time before she left the apartment feeling
slightly guilty to leave her friend in that state, but knew she couldn't
help her that much anyway.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Ling stood outside of Ally's apartment thinking how she should act. She was
unsure if she should simply walk straight in and declare she was wrong and
Ally was right, or if she should ring the bell and hope Ally would let her
in. As she stood there someone came up behind Ling.</p>

<p>"Hello Ling." the person said the voice angry, making Ling jump like a
scared rabbit.</p>

<p>She turned and saw it was Renee. "Ehm... Hi Renee." Ling replied.
Understanding that Ally had told her best friend everything. "I... I'm here
to apologize to Ally." she managed to explain.</p>

<p>"Really? I whish you luck, but I don't think you will have any." Renee
replied. She looked at Ling with a stern face. "You are serious in apology
to her?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you will only apologize to her?" Renee continued.</p>

<p>"No. We have other things to discuss to, if she wants to."</p>

<p>"Okay. I'll let you in at least. Maybe all this can be over then."</p>

<p>Ling gave Renee a small smile. "Not over, just changed I hope." she
corrected Renee, making Renee feel a cold shill running down her back.</p>

<p>Ally looked up to see who was coming through the apartment door. She saw
Ling and prepared herself for another fight. Before she could say anything
Ling said, "I'm sorry."</p>

<p>Ling walked over to her and hugged her tightly and then said, "I'm so sorry
for hurting you."</p>

<table cellspacing=0 width=100%>

<p>Ally could simply stare at Ling.</p>

<p>Ling feeling a bit awkward smiled insecurely and said, "Well are you going
to say anything?"</p>

<p>"Y... You are sorry?" Ally managed to reply stammering not believing she
actually heard Ling apologizing to her.</p>

<p>"Yes you were right all the time." Ling blushed. "I was just afraid. I
have actually never been in love with anyone before, and certainly not in a
woman." she confessed.</p>

<p>"You are in l... love with me?" Ally continued to stammer.</p>

<p>Ling simply nodded making Ally feel a warm feeling go through her body.
Then she got a suspicious look and said, "You are not playing with me so
that we can start work again?" The question was answered of Ling with a
negative shake of her head. They looked at eachother a long time and then
suddenly Ling leaned forward and kissed Ally. The kiss was brief but
intensive.</p>

<p>Ally closed her eyes and with a broad smile whispered, "More." which Ling
had nothing against obeying.</p>

<p>Renee stood and saw how Ally and Ling began to kiss eachother. She still
felt a little bit unpleasant to the thought of two women kissing but
managed to shrug it off. She thought that Ally maybe finally would be
happy. Walking towards her bedroom she shook her head amazed that someone
could prefer the same sex instead of the opposite.</p>

<p>After they had kissed a couple of times, Ling looked at Ally with serious
eyes. "I'm still new to all this... I... I don't know how far I'm ready to
go right now."</p>

<p>Looking a little bit relieved Ally replied, "I'm as new to this as you
are." smiling a reassuring smile at Ling she added, "I don't want to go to
fast either. Let's take it easy and work on this slowly, ok?"</p>

<p>"That sounds good to me." Ling replied. She thought for a moment and then
asked, "What are you doing tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Nothing special, why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"How about dinner?"</p>

<p>Pretending to think it over Ally answered after a short moment, "When?"</p>

<p>"Well. how about six o'clock?" Ling suggested.</p>

<p>"Sounds perfect to me." Ally answered. She then looked at Ling seeming to
hesitate.</p>

<p>"Do you want to ask me something?" Ling asked noticing Ally's hesitation.</p>

<p>"Well... Would you like to spend the night here?" Ally asked and held her
breath while waiting for a reply.</p>

<p>"Isn't that a little bit to fast? I mean sleeping with eachother?" Ling
asked, hesitant to the suggestion.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean that we have sex... I just want you to be here so that
I know that this isn't some mean dream I have." Ally explained. Blushing
slightly of embarrassment. "We have an extra bed that you could use."</p>

<p>Ling closed the little space between them again and said before she kissed
Ally, "I assure you this is not a dream."</p>

<p>"Will you stay with me then?"</p>

<p>"Why not." Ling shrugged. "It's not like we have anything to do
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Not?" Ally looked wondering at Ling.</p>

<p>Ling got a mischievous grin and explained, "Well, I thought we could take
the day off."</p>

<p>Ally returned the grin and nodded. "Yeah, let's take tomorrow off."</p>

<p>"Ehrm..." they were interrupted by Renee. When she got their attention
she said, "I'm going to make some coffee do you two want anything?"</p>

<p>Ally looked at Ling who nodded and then looked back at Renee, "That would
be nice, thanks." she said giving Renee a smile.</p>

<p>Renee brought a plate with three cups of coffee. She put it on the coffee
table and sat down in an armchair looking curios at the couple in the
couch. "So, are you two an official couple now?" she asked smiling, her
eyes got that teasing look Ally had came to know very well.</p>

<p>Ally expecting Renee to tease them looked at her with a mock angry look but
before she could respond Ling answered, "Yeah, we are a couple. I'm even
going spend the night here."</p>

<p>"You had to tell her that?" Ally asked worried Renee wouldn't want to
know it.</p>

<p>"Why not? We're not going to have sex so why would it bother her." Ling
looked at Renee. "It doesn't bother you that I'm sleeping over here right?"</p>

<p>Renee shook her head. "Nope." she said. "Ally don't worry. We both have had
guys sleeping over so why would it bother me if she slept over?"</p>

<p>"Well eh..." Ally couldn't think of an answer.</p>

<p>Renee looked at her annoyed. "Ally! I told you I would support you whatever
you do, well almost everything except criminal actions." Renee exclaimed
knowing what Ally thought. "Why are you so afraid I would start hate you
just because you are gay?"</p>

<p>"I don't know... Guess I'm simply scared of all this new things happening
to me." Ally trailed off, too ashamed to meet Renee's eyes.</p>

<p>"You're wrong." Renee simply stated. "You're not afraid of this being
gay. I think you're afraid of those feelings you have for Ling here." Renee
continued. "I remember how you looked like after Billy left you and now I
think you are afraid it will happen all over again with Ling."</p>

<p>Ling took Ally's hand. "If it is any comfort for you, I'm also scared to
death that this won't work out as good as I hope it will."</p>

<p>Ally smiled back at Ling. "I... I love you." she said simply letting her
self drown in Ling's beautiful dark eyes. Giving away a small chuckle Ally
commented, "It feels like we've said this all before. I must be dense, not
realizing it."</p>

<p>"Nah... you are just you. That's what I like about you." Ling replied
moving even closer to Ally than before.</p>

<p>Renee stood up and stretched her arms in the air. "It's late and I have to
go up early." she looked at the other two. "Do you two lovebirds want me to
wake you up or are you going to have a late morning?"</p>

<p>Ling replied with a smile. "We're going to take a free day tomorrow so I
don't think it will be necessary to wake us up."</p>

<p>"Ok. Good night then and promise to not make to much noises kids." Renee
said with her teasing voice getting angry stares after her, she run into
her bedroom and the safety.</p>

<p>When Renee had closed her bedroom door Ling turned her face to Ally and
asked, "Is she always like that?"</p>

<p>"Yeah... She loves to tease me, since she knows I don't really get hurt
by it." Ally replied as she placed the empty cups on the plate and brought
them to the sink. "Do you want a nightgown or anything to sleep in?" Ally
asked from the kitchen.</p>

<p>Ling had begun to look at some pictures Ally had on the shelf above the
fireplace. "I don't need anything. I can sleep in my underwear." she
answered.</p>

<p>"Okay. The right side of the bathroom cabinet is mine. There should be an
unused toothbrush there that you can use." Ally continued from the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Do you need any help?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm almost finished. You go on and get ready for bed."</p>

<p>Ling nodded and went in to the bathroom looking for the toothbrush. She
found it and a tube with toothpaste beside it. When she was brushing her
teeth Ally knocked on the door. "Yeah what is it?" Ling slurred, her mouth
filled with toothpaste, saliva and toothbrush.</p>

<p>"Can I come in?" Ally asked. When no one answered, Ally went in and saw
Ling standing before the bathroom cabinet and brushing her teeth. The
toothbrush she used had a red color and Ally recognized it as her own.
"Eh... That is my toothbrush." she said.</p>

<p>Ling spit out the mix of saliva and toothpaste in the basin and said, "Oh,
I'm sorry. I didn't find any others."</p>

<p>"It's okay. I have put out the extra bed and put it beside my own." Ally
said and went over to Ling. "I have put on clean sheets too."</p>

<p>Ling washed her mouth and dried it with a towel Ally passed to her. "Sounds
fine to me." she said smiling at Ally.</p>

<p>Ally leaned forward and gave Ling a small kiss on her cheek and said, "I'll
be right with you."</p>

<p>Ling nodded and went out to Ally's bedroom.</p>

<p>When Ally came out of the bathroom Ling lied in the extra bed and turned
her head looking at Ally. Ally looked at Ling and they held eye contact for
about five minutes, then Ally went over to her own bed and slipped down
under her sheets. Looking at Ling she finally said, "Good night." and
turned off the light.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Ling lied in the bed she had woken some minutes before and couldn't go to
sleep again. "Ally?" she whispered, to low to wake Ally who slept like a
log. "Ally!" Ling said a little bit higher now awakening Ally who stirred.</p>

<p>"Huh?" Ally opened her eyes to see Ling's face right over her. "Hi
there..." she said smiling and looked around. "It doesn't seem to be
morning yet."</p>

<p>"I know but it's freezing. Where do you have an extra blanket?" Ling
asked as she moved to sit beside Ally.</p>

<p>Ally yawned and thought for a moment. "There should be a blanket in my
closet but... I don't feel like going to fetch it. You can sleep beside me,
that would be warmer."</p>

<p>"Well, we could try it at least. You didn't plan this did you?" Ling
asked as she slid down beneath Ally's quilt. Ally giggled as she shook her
head.</p>

<p>"You're freezing!" Ally exclaimed as she felt Ling's feet touch hers.</p>

<p>"I told you. I was freezing."</p>

<p>"Yeah that you were freezing not that you were this cold. Come closer so
that I can warm you up."</p>

<p>"Ally, I can't come any closer than what I am."</p>

<p>"Oh... I missed that." Ally giggled. "I must still be sleeping."</p>

<p>"Yeah, sleep well."</p>

<p>"You too." Both women got silent and soon they both slept like logs.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Renee peeked in at Ally's bedroom. She couldn't resist seeing if they
actually had had sex or not. What she saw was an Ally and a Ling sprawled
together in Ally's bed. Convincing Renee that they had had sex during the
night. Chuckling for herself she thought that they at least had been quiet.
She closed the bedroom-door and went over to the bathroom to get ready for
today.</p>

<p>Ally opened her eyes looking at Ling. "She has closed the door."</p>

<p>"I know. I just don't want to move." Ling replied her eyes still shut.
"Do you think we tricked her?"</p>

<p>"Well... Let's see, we are both naked, lie in bed together, she also know
we are kind a couple and finally we were sleeping. Well pretending to
sleep. I think she bought it." Ally smiled, they had paid back for Renee's
teasing the night before.</p>

<p>"You know... Even though I want to sleep with you I don't really know
how." she heard the other woman say as she snuggled closer to her.</p>

<p>Ally giggled. "Neither do I."</p>

<p>Ling opened her eyes looking at Ally. "I'm sure whatever you do would be
just wonderful."</p>

<p>They looked at eachother thinking how it would be to touch the other woman
would it be as it always been? Or would it feel different? Ally remembered
how it had felt when they had lied there to trick Renee, she wanted to feel
that again but decided it could wait till later when both were sure they
weren't doing any mistakes. "I'm hungry." she exclaimed. "Wonder if Renee
have done any breakfast?"</p>

<p>"I'm also hungry. Why not go and see what you have in your fridge?" Ling
asked.</p>

<p>"Okay, let's go." Ally said and climbed out of the bed.</p>

<p>"Eh... Ally..." Ling smiled a bit embarrassed at Ally who stood beside
the bed.</p>

<p>"Yes? What is it?" Ally looked back with an asking look.</p>

<p>"Well maybe you should put something on yourself..." Ling said a bit
amused.</p>

<p>Ally then remembered she was stark naked. "Oh, you're right. Sorry I seem
to be a bit absent-minded."</p>

<p>"I don't mind at all but I think Renee might." Ling replied as she also
got up and out of the bed.</p>

<p>Ally checked in her closet and threw a pink satin bathrobe and then put on
another one she had. They walked out into the kitchen where Renee were busy
fried some eggs.</p>

<p>"Are you two actually eating eggs to breakfast?" Ling asked when she saw
the fried eggs in the pan.</p>

<p>"Yes." Renee replied. "Guess you don't want any?"</p>

<p>"No. It is too much cholesterol." Ling dismissed the offer. "I would like
some coffee and a glass of orange juice."</p>

<p>"And you?" Renee mentioned at Ally who had sat down beside Ling.</p>

<p>"Oh... You don't have to do anything. Since we are going to take the day
off, I can make our breakfast." Ally said. She stood up and began to walk
at the fridge.</p>

<p>"Well, I thought when I'm already doing my own breakfast I can do it for
you two. Besides, I imagine you two are quite exhausted anyway." Renee
answered with a big teasing grin.</p>

<p>Ally and Ling looked at her with amused faces. Something Renee didn't
expect. "We didn't have any sex at all last night." Ling told Renee as she
and Ally began to giggle.</p>

<p>"That wasn't nice." Renee grimaced at Ally. "Now I won't have any gossip
to tell Elaine." she replied with a grin, knowing Ally's reaction.</p>

<p>"What?" Ally's eyes were big as saucers. "Don't even dare to think of
telling anyone at my office about who slept over here!" she screamed at
Renee. She moved towards Renee with a knife in her hand.</p>

<p>She was held back by Ling who when Ally had calmed down turned towards
Renee and said with a dangerous voice, "She is right. If you tell anyone of
our common 'friends', they will have to defend me and Ally for murder."</p>

<p>Renee held up her hands in front of her in a defending pose, "I won't tell
them anything. I was just teasing."</p>

<p>"You better be..." Ally mumbled still looking angry on Renee.</p>

<p>"Oh, come on! Ally, you know I won't tell anyone if you don't want to."
Renee insured Ally.</p>

<p>They all went quiet for an awkward moment. Then Ally nodded.</p>

<p>Renee looked at her watch and cried out, "Oh hell I'm late!" She looked at
Ally and asked with one word, "Friends?"</p>

<p>Ally nodded again, "Yes friends."</p>

<p>As Renee hurried out of the apartment she called out a, "Bye!" to Ally and
Ling.</p>

<p>After the door had shut Ling looked at Ally. "So, what do you want do to
day?"</p>

<p>Ally thought for a moment and then said, "Well, I think there is a new
antiquarian bookstore down street. I kinda like old books..."</p>

<p>Ling smiled at Ally. "You're kidding! Me too." she said. "Do you like the
feeling to hold a really old book? 'Cause I love to touch it and smell the
scent of them."</p>

<p>Ally nodded. "Yeah, I love that with old books."</p>

<p>"Do you know when it is open?"</p>

<p>"Sometime around nine, I think."</p>

<p>"What do we do till then?"</p>

<p>"Eating breakfast." Ally replied as she handed Ling a bowl with milk and
light müsli.</p>

<p>"Okay, what's this?" Ling looked down at the bowl.</p>

<p>"Milk and extra healthy müsli." Ally replied. She sat down beside Ling
and began to eat from her own bowl.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>The door to the bookstore made a small bell sound with a light tone. Ally
and Ling stepped inside it and began to look around. Ling took up an old
book about the civilwar. As she read inside it an old letter fell out. She
took it up and read the receiver's name on it. Surprised she saw it had
been sent to her great-grandmother. She took out the sheet of paper from
the envelope and began to read.</p>

<p>My Love</p>

<p>I miss you so much... I wish you could be here with me forever.
 	How is your son? I wish he were ours... even though I know that
is
 	Impossible even if we could be together. Why? Why can we not
 	be together? I know we are the perfect couple even though you
 	are married with that man! How I hate him! I am sorry, I know
 	you love him too. You must visit me here at my new home in
 	Boston. I do not think anyone really know about what we did, but
 	this, I know is the best way. The address is at the other side
of this
 	letter... I love you, but we both know our love will never be
 	accepted by anyone. </p>

<p>Promise me that you will never love anyone as you love me.</p>

<p>Yours Julie </p>

<p>Ally stepped up beside Ling. "What's that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I... I don't know." Ling answered looking puzzled. "I think this letter
was meant for my grandmother. It's the right address and her name."</p>

<p>"What does it says?" Ally asked curious.</p>

<p>"I... I... think it is a love letter."</p>

<p>"Really? Wow. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"It's a she." Ling replied half-dazed.</p>

<p>"Hello? Ling? Are you alright?" Ally called out with a worried look.</p>

<p>Ling looked at Ally with a strange smile. "It appears that I'm not the only
one who's gay in my family."</p>

<p>"Good or bad?" Ally asked a bit worried.</p>

<p>"What?" Ling asked, she hadn't heard Ally.</p>

<p>"I asked if it was good or bad. For us I mean."</p>

<p>"This won't change anything we have between us." Ling ensured Ally with a
smile. She gave Ally a short hug and then said, "I love you."</p>

<p>Ally looked back with an unsure look. "Are you sure?" she asked.</p>

<p>Ling simply smiled back, nodded and kissed Ally lightly.</p>

<p>Smiling back after the kiss Ally commented, "That was a yes, right?"</p>

<p>Ling nodded, "Yes do you love me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I love you too." Ally replied.</p>

<p>"Ehrm..." a voice interrupted them.</p>

<p>Ally and Ling broke apart embarrassed. They both straightened their
clothes.</p>

<p>"Yes?" Ally asked with an embarrassed smile.</p>

<p>"Are you going to buy anything or are you just using my store as a place
for your escapades?" the old man asked them with a stern look. "If you
aren't going to buy anything then please leave." he said with the same
tone.</p>

<p>Ling looked down on the book she was holding. "Well, I want to know who you
got this book from." Ling handed the book to the storekeeper.</p>

<p>The keeper took the book and looked at it. "Why do you want to know that?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I believe that my grandmother owned it. I found a letter addressed to
her in it." Ling replied.</p>

<p>"Oh... Well let me check it in my computer."</p>

<p>"Computer?" Ally asked. "Sorry, but it takes away some of the feeling
when you know there is a computer here." she explained when the man looked
at her.</p>

<p>He smiled at her and replied, "Yes I know, that's why I keep it in my
office."</p>

<p>He showed them into a small room filled with old books and papers. "Please
excuse me for the mess. I'm in the middle of catalogize a new shipment I
got yesterday."</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>The storekeeper hit the 'on' button on an old computer and waited for a
minute for it to start the operative system. He smiled at them and said,
"It's an old IBM 486 PC, not that I need anything better."</p>

<p>"It doesn't do anything." Ally replied. "I'm not that much into computers
myself."</p>

<p>"You should turn to this guy." Ling said, holding a card in her hand. "he
can help you get a new computer for only 500 dollars or even lower." she
added.</p>

<p>Ally looked at Ling, surprised she said, "You amazes me all the time. Do
you have a computer store to?"</p>

<p>"Yes. My brother runs it." Ling replied.</p>

<p>Before they could continue the old man interrupted. "Ah, here it is. I
bought it in 1955 in a garage sale. The man I bought it from is named John
Woo."</p>

<p>"That's my uncle." Ling exclaimed, now sure the book had been her
grandmother's. "What does the book cost? I want to buy it."</p>

<p>"Well... The book isn't that rare so you can have it for 100 dollars."</p>

<p>"You got a deal old man."</p>

<p>Ling paid the storekeeper and then they left the store. Back in Ally's
apartment they checked the old book closer. </p>

<p>"I recognize this book." Ally stated. "Look. It's part two." she got up
from the couch and went for her closet. When she came back she held a book
in her hands and had a triumphing smile. "Look. This is part one." Ally
opened the book and showed the inside of the cover. "See what it says." she
said as she pointed at some rows of text written there.</p>

<p>Ling read the words loud. "Dear love of my heart. I give you this book as a
sign of my love for you. Your love." she looked up at Ally. "Who wrote it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I asked my grandma once when she gave me the book. She
didn't know but believed it to be her father who had written it." Ally
replied.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. See it says the same here but it is a different
handwriting." Ling showed the inside of her book's cover.</p>

<p>"There's a name there too... 'Julie'."</p>

<p>"There was an address on the other side of the letter." Ling added. "It
says, **a street in Boston** anything you recognize?"</p>

<p>"Yeah... That's where my grandma grew up." Ally looked down at Ling.
"What's Julie's surname?"</p>

<p>"Barslow."</p>

<p>"That's my grandma's maiden name!" Ally replied shocked. She looked at
Ling. "D-d-do you think they were..." she couldn't finish her sentence.</p>

<p>Ling looked back at her with the same shocked look. "I-I don't know. I
can't believe that my great-grandma actually cheated on her husband..."
ling shook her head.</p>

<p>"If they were... Can you imagine how it must have been for them then?"
Ally had sat down beside Ling, to shocked to stand up.</p>

<p>"We're lucky, I think it was illegal back then when they lived."</p>

<p>"Yeah..." Ally looked at Ling. "I have thought about one thing..."</p>

<p>"What?" Ling looked back curious.</p>

<p>"Well, we asked Renee to be quiet about us being a couple..." Ally
hesitated a little. "When do you think we should tell our friends at the
office?"</p>

<p>"I..." Ling thought for a moment. "I think we should tell them as soon as
we can."</p>

<p>Ally looked at Ling with a hesitant look. "Are you sure? I mean I agree
somehow, but are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, mostly because our great-grandparent's love had to be a secret. I
feel that we somehow owe them to tell the world about us." Ling replied.</p>

<p>Ally thought over Ling's reply for a short time then answered, "You are
right." giving her a small smile she asked, "So when?"</p>

<p>Ling looked at her watch. "Well, it's only a half hour past lunch. Maybe to
night at the pub?"</p>

<p>"Sounds perfect to me." Ally's belly gave away a low sound. Slightly
embarrassed she said, "I-I think I'm hungry or at least my tummy is."</p>

<p>Ling smiled amused at her when her own stomach gave away a similar sound.
"I think I'm starved too." she commented her own belly's noises.</p>

<p>"Eat here or out?"</p>

<p>"Out. I can't wait for us to cook food. To be honest, I'm not so good at
cooking either." Ling replied. She got a thought in her mind and looked at
Ally with a questioning look, "Can we call this our second date or should
we call it our first real date?"</p>

<p>"Well we did everything you normally do on dates. We had dinner, we
talked, we danced, and you followed me to my door, well almost to my door.
You even gave me a kinda good night kiss."</p>

<p>"Yeah... I remember that kiss. I wanted to kiss you on your mouth but was
afraid you didn't want me to so I did the second best, I kissed you on your
cheek." Ling smiled at Ally.</p>

<p>"Oh..." Ally smiled back with a mischievous grin. "I wouldn't mind you
kissing me anywhere at all."</p>

<p>Ling didn't answer, just smiled at Ally leand over and kissed her gently on
her lips. When they ended the kiss she asked, "Where do we go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know a perfect place some blocks down street." Ally replied with
some excitement in her voice. "It's a sweet place to eat at. And they have
the best pasta I know."</p>

<p>"I don't know, I don't like pasta."</p>

<p>"This one, you will definitely like." Ally said trying to convince Ling
to eat there.</p>

<p>"Okay. Let's go." Ling decided and they left the apartment and went to
the nice, small italian restaurant.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>  "You were right. This pasta is really nice." Ling stated after they had
finished eating.</p>

<p>"I told you so." Ally replied with a smile.</p>

<p>Ling looked at Ally. "I think I would want to have some new clothes for
tonight. Wanna go shopping with me?"</p>

<p>"Why not? I need some stuff too." Ally replied. "Where do you buy your
clothes?"</p>

<p>"Mostly at a small store named Leigh's closet." **Is this a workable name
for a clothes shop?** Ling replied, curious to why Ally wanted to know.</p>

<p>"You do? I do that too." Ally said. "Wonder why we haven't met there
before."</p>

<p>Ling smiled at her. "You have exeptional good taste." Ling saw a question
form on Ally's lips and answered before she asked it, "My sister Leigh is
the manager and owner for that store. She is the only one I ask for advice
when I buy clothes. If you buy clothes there you simply must have good
taste."</p>

<p>"Thanks. You too." Ally smiled, she took up her purse and looked in it.
"This lunch is on me." she said as she put some money beside the receipt.</p>

<p>"Thanks for this late lunch." Ling said as they left the restaurant.</p>

<p>Ally looked surprised at Ling. "You thanking for being treated lunch?"</p>

<p>"Yeah..." Ling saw Ally's look and added, "What?"</p>

<p>"It's unusual to hear you say thank you." Ally replied. "I liked that."</p>

<p>"Oh, I only thanks those I deem worthy of it."</p>

<p>"Am I worthy?"</p>

<p>"Yes you are." Ling answered taking Ally's hand. She noticed how nice it
felt to hold Ally's hand. "Take a cab or walk?" Ling asked.</p>

<p>"I'm too stuffed to walk, let´s take a cab."</p>

<p>Ling called out to a cab that just had dropped off an old couple outside of
the restaurant. They stepped in and Ling told the driver where they wanted
to go.</p>

<p>They stepped outside a store that looked very nice from the outside. The
store-window had a couple of mannequins wearing beutiful modern clothes.
When they stepped inside they saw Leigh sitting behind the counter eating a
sallad.</p>

<p>As Leigh looked up she said, "Sorry but it's closed for lunch." When she
saw it was her sister she got a smile and stood up to greet her and Ally.
"Hi." she said and leaned over the counter to give Ling a hug.</p>

<p>"Hi sis. You know Ally." Ling said as they hugged.</p>

<p>Ally stuck out her hand and Leigh took it as they greeted. "I know. She's a
regular here."</p>

<p>"Yeah she told me." Ling commented.</p>

<p>"So what do you want?" Leigh asked after they had greeted.</p>

<p>"A new top and panties." Ling replied. She looked over at Ally waiting
for her to tell what she wanted.</p>

<p>"I need some new panty hose." Ally said, showing up four fingers to show
how many she wanted.</p>

<p>"Same as usual?" Ally nodded in response. "I get them as soon as I am
finished helping my sis." Leigh said as she moved her attention back to her
sister. "Are you two going to some meeting after lunch?" she asked as she
went over to some sweaters.</p>

<p>"No, why?" Ling asked as she followed.</p>

<p>"Well why are you together then? I can't recall you two ever been
together."</p>

<p>"So what? Can't I have new friends?" Ling snapped at her sister.</p>

<p>"Uh... Of course you can have, but you usually don't unless they are
forced on you." Leighs answer made Ally giggle. Ling growled at her sister
and girlfriend.</p>

<p>"You really know your sister well." Ally commented when she finished
giggling. "We were kinda forced together by our bosses. Ouch!" Ally stoped
as she got an elbow in her stomac. Recieving a warning look from Ling she
continued anyway, "Um... Our fighting made the office a battlefield,
lowering the efficiency of the firm."</p>

<p>Leigh laughed. "That sounds like my sis." she said as she steped out of
reach from Ling's fists. "What were you fighting about?"</p>

<p>Before Ally could answer, Ling interrupted and said, "We were fighting
about who had the best taste."</p>

<p>Leigh looked at Ling for amoment, then with a suspicious voice said, "Why
don't I believe you?"</p>

<p>Ally looked sanctimonious, "We did not..." she began to say but was
interrupted by Ling.</p>

<p>"Ally, I don't want her to know yet."</p>

<p>"Why not? Is it because she's family?" Ally asked with an irritated
voice.</p>

<p>"What? Are you gay or something?" Leigh asked. When neither Ally or Ling
answered her she laughed nervously, "Y-you are joking with me right?"</p>

<p>Ling shook her head and replied, "No, I'm in love with... Ally."</p>

<p>"So that's why you are here both of you?" Leigh asked and both of them
nodded in response. "Did you sleep over at her place last night?" Leigh
added.</p>

<p>"Yeah, how did you know that?"</p>

<p>"I called you but you never answered or called back."</p>

<p>"Oh... Why?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to show you my latest design."</p>

<p>"What kind of design?" Ling asked looking curious.</p>

<p>Ally looked at Ling with an astonished look. Ling noticed it and asked,
"What?"</p>

<p>"You are so different from the Ling at the office."</p>

<p>"So? At work I have to be tough, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing." Ally smiled. "I fell in love with 'tough Ling' but I think
I like 'nice Ling' better."</p>

<p>"As long as you love anyone of my selves." Ling smiled back. She turned
her head toward her sister. "I'm busy tonight, but I think I'm free
tomorrow." she looked at Ally for confirmation.</p>

<p>"I have to work late tomorrow, so I'll be busy." Ally said.</p>

<p>"Okay, tomorrow night then?" Leigh asked as she showed Ling the sweater
she had taken from the table.</p>

<p>Ling looked at it. "It's beutiful!" she exclaimed with a small sigh. She
took it from her sister and showed it for Ally. "It will fit me perfectly
don't you think?"</p>

<p>"I can clearly se you being very cute in that one." Ally replied with a
small smile, surprised how different Ling was here compared to how she
usually acted at the firm.</p>

<p>"I go and try it out." Ling said as she went towards a couple of small
box sized locker rooms.</p>

<p>As Ling changed Leigh looked at Ally, her look changed from a nice look to
a suspicious look. "If you hurt my sister at all..." she threatened Ally.</p>

<p>"I don't inted to hurt her at all." Ally replied, slightly offended.</p>

<p>"You better not." Leigh muttered as Ling stepped out of the box.</p>

<p>Ling stood in front of Ally and Leigh. The sweater followed her lines
perfectly as if it were a second skin. It looked simply gorgeous on her as
she turned around to show it from other angles.</p>

<p>Ally grasped loudly as she saw Ling come out. She couldn't take her eyes
off Ling's upper body part.</p>

<p>Ling walked up close to Ally and whispered in her ear, "I see you like it."
Ally could only nodd in response. Ling looked at her sister. "I take this
one, sis." she said and then added, "I don't need you to protect me. I can
take care of my self." and with that revealed she had heard her sister's
warning towards Ally.</p>

<p>As her sister looked sanctimonious as she took a new sweater and put it in
a bag. "I just don't want her to hurt you." Leigh said as she handed the
bag to Ling.</p>

<p>"She won't hurt me." Ling said but didn't seem to convince her sister. "I
promise. We will probably love eachother until our deaths."</p>

<p>"For her best, I hope you're right." Leigh replied as Ally and Ling
stepped out of the shop.</p>

<p>As the stood outside of the store Ally looked sadly at Ling. "I don't think
your sister likes me anymore."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't worry. She is like that towards all my boy... partners." Ling
looked at her watch. "I need to get home. Wanna come?"</p>

<p>Ally looked at her won watch. "Yes, but I have some stuff to do myself. See
you at the pub six o'clock?"</p>

<p>"Sure." As they sat down in the cab Ling asked, "Should we meet outside
or inside?"</p>

<p>"Inside. We don't have to tell them until we are inside. And besides I
would like to see their reaction when we greet eachother with a kiss." Ally
replied with a content smile.</p>

<p>"Sounds good to me." Ling said as the cab drove off towards Ally's
apartment.</p>
