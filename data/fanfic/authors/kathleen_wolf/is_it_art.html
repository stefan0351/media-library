<!-- Is It Art? \ null -->

<p>Nicole felt, more than consciously let, the drawing tools slip from her hand. When they came to a soft stop on the floor, she leaned forward and closed her hand around Buffy's.</p>
		<p>Buffy felt her heart race a little as the woman's fingers touched her, and her mind couldn't deny the electricity in the touch. It was so easy all of a sudden, she realized as she pulled slightly urging Nicole closer.</p>
		<p>Nicole moved towards the prone slayer slowly dropping onto her knees as she approached the naked young woman.</p>
		<p>"Can I tell you now how beautiful you look?" She rested just short of the blonde.</p>
		<p>Buffy licked her lips not sure if she was going to say something or if she was suddenly just completely unsure about whether or not she was ready to kiss her. Not that she was worried about kissing a woman.  Just suddenly she wasn't sure if she was a good enough kisser.</p>
		<p>"What?" Buffy asked distracted blinking heavy eyelids. "You can tell anything you want." She whispered softly when her mind caught up to the question.</p>
		<p>"You are beautiful." Nicole stated, she lifted a charcoal stained hand and pushed it through Buffy's hair.</p>
		<p>"I usually..." Buffy went to say something but her heart just wasn't in putting herself down, it couldn't be, not here after what they'd done. "Thank you." She settled on the simple words.</p>
		<p>"Why is it so hard for you to believe?" Nicole tried to settle herself more comfortably on her knees as her hand instinctively cupped around Buffy's cheek, she had seen the brief look of doubt on the Slayer's face.</p>
		<p>"Cause Nicole, I'm the slayer." Buffy tried to explain wanting so much to be able too but knowing maybe she never could.</p>
		<p>"And the slayer can't be beautiful?" Nicole frowned shaking her head softly.</p>
		<p>"The world doesn't want or need me to be beautiful, I'm just supposed to do my job." Buffy felt her mood threatening to change as she answered.</p>
		<p>"You know I could teach you so much about beauty, about need, and want." Nicole drew her finger over the sculpted cheekbones leaving a light grey smudge of charcoal in her wake.</p>
		<p>"I want you to teach me." Buffy felt the easy desire that the drawing session had kindled in her flare up again.</p>
		<p>"Do you?" Nicole traced along Buffy's cheek her eyes following her fingers.</p>
		<p>"Yes." Buffy answered her eyes fluttering closed under the touch.</p>
		<p>"Well it would start with this." The artist leaned forward and placed her lips over her fingers that she rested on Buffy's lips. She softly moved her fingers down off the Slayer's mouth as she pressed her lips against them harder.</p>
		<p>Buffy didn't move for a moment as her body slowly melted into the connection. When her mind did catch up to her speeding heart rate she leaned up to press harder.</p>
		<p>Nicole felt the strength her model put into their kiss increase and couldn't help but inch forward, her hand, that still held Buffy's squeezed it slightly before pulling back breaking their kiss.</p>
		<p>"That was..." Buffy felt the artist pull back and took a staggered breath. She just gave a goofy grin as she looked up at Nicole.</p>
		<p>"Yes, it was wasn't it?" Nicole smiled back though her smile was more refined. "Oops, I got charcoal on your cheek, let me get a cloth." The artist glanced over her shoulder but did not actually move.</p>
		<p>"I'm sure it's just a tiny bit." Buffy ?s grin softened down.</p>
		<p>"Well it doesn't mar your perfection in any way at all." Nick replied honestly and Buffy felt her face go a bright shade of red and she bit her lip slightly. "Would you rather I stopped going on about how amazing you are?" </p>
		<p>"No, it's just..." Buffy contemplated for a moment. "You know when you know someone really means something and you can't argue with them cause it's how they feel and it's not a line?" She laughed lightly. "God now I'm babbling like Willow."  Nicole sat back on her heals a little and watched Buffy for a moment as she struggled with her reply. "You look really beautiful too." Buffy added after watching the candlelight dance of Nicole's face for a moment.</p>
		<p>The artist's smile spread across her face gradually, her chocolate eyes smiled in their own happiness.</p>
		<p>"We're both kinda skirting round the thoughts and feelings that caused me to drop my best sketches yet, aren't we?" Nick tilted her head a little and moved her hand to rest on Buffy's naked shoulder.</p>
		<p>"Sorry." Buffy apologized pulling herself up to sit so they were eye to eye, their hands still clasped together. "For skirting not for getting you to drop the sketches." </p>
		<p>"For a slayer you apologise a lot." Nicole laughed softly.</p>
		<p>"It's sorta new." Buffy realized as she admitted the fact. "I just don't want to do something wrong." She felt the admission slip out as well.</p>
		<p>"There is no right or wrong Buffy," Nicole let her hand moved down Buffy's long pale arm.. "There's just passion and feeling and art." She pushed herself up a little on her knees pushing her body lightly against the Slayer's.</p>
		<p>"There are definitely those things." Buffy shifted moving to press even closer, the feeling of her bare body against Nicole's clothed one made every nerve in her body tingle.</p>
		<p>"Oh Buffy." Nicole moved her arm around the Slayer's naked body and pressed it openly on her mid back, drawing the Slayer closer still.</p>
		<p>Buffy hesitated for just a second before she closed her eyes and kissed the brunette. Instantly she rewarded herself, for the amazing feeling it elicited made her head swim.  She wound her free arm around Nicole in similar fashion.  Tilting her head Nicole moved herself so that the kiss became both easier and more comfortable.  She gently urged Buffy to make it deeper moving her flat hand up and down warm soft skin. </p>
		<p>Without consideration the Slayer did just that, letting pressure and sensation give way to heat and wetness.</p>
		<p>Their kiss lasted a long time, hands timidly exploring each other's backs, the others gripping and relaxing in rhythm. Slowly Buffy slipped her hand up under the edge of Nicole's shirt feeling the warm skin of her lower back.</p>
		<p>Nicole closed her eyes, her head spinning slightly her heart pounding as Buffy's hands moved briefly at the edge of her shirt. A part of her wanted to rip it off, in very dramatic and artistic style, but another part of her needed to keep it on. </p>
		<p>Buffy hand inched upwards, moving over the artist's bra strap inquisitively. It was a first for the Slayer and she revelled in the idea as it turned her already aroused body on further.</p>
		<p>"Mmmmm." Nicole pressed herself against Buffy's body tightly, her hand slipping down to caress the smaller woman's bare backside.  She was unable to cool the intense feelings of desire the Slayer's exploration under her shirt caused.</p>
		<p>Buffy heard a slight moan slip out of her lips as she pressed her own hand higher trying to find a way to rid the material from the brunette's body.</p>
		<p>"Oh Buffy you feel..." Nicole began, as she slid her hands down lower over warm silky thighs. </p>
		<p>"Not half as nice as you." Buffy whispered back, as she ran her hand up and down the full length of the artist's back.  </p>
		<p>Nicole felt her very soul invaded by intense feeling as she breathed in the warm scented air in the room. She was about to lean in and kiss the Slayer again, with all the heavy want and desire she felt when she suddenly froze. </p>
		<p>?What are you doing?' Her mind questioned spinning away from her body that arched as Buffy's hand trailed downwards.  ?She shouldn't do this to Buffy.'</p>
		<p>"Buffy." She coughed once and then cleared her throat again, letting her hand drop awkwardly to the Slayer's side.</p>
		<p>"Nick?" Buffy felt the sudden tension in the body she held but it took her a moment to calm the feverish arousal inside her.  "Nicole, what's wrong?" She asked softly.</p>
		<p>"It's not so warm in here.  Perhaps you should put my robe back on?" The artist moved back on her knees giving the Slayer a little room.</p>
		<p>"What?" Buffy pulled her arms back to her, suddenly instantly feeling so exposed as she crossed them over her body. Slowly her hand snaked out and she pulled the light material up over her, not quite sure what had gone so wrong.</p>
		<p>"Oh God I hope I didn't ruin the sketches." The artist glanced over her shoulder at the pages of her sketchbook strewn around the floor. She hurried over and began picking them up.</p>
		<p>"I'm gonna get dressed." Buffy wrapped the robe tightly around her now frozen body and began to dart towards the bathroom, her mind full of panic and hurt.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, okay."  Nicole hated herself for agreeing for not explaining or stopping her</p>
		<p>"Okay." The Slayer agreed with her own suggestion as she made it into the hallway and into the bathroom.</p>
		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>
		<p>?Stupid, stupid, stupid.' She ranted at herself as she closed and locked the bathroom door and then shoved herself back into her own clothing. ?You are so stupid. What the hell did you think you were doing?' She pulled on her boots sitting down on the edge of the tub as she put them on. ?How are you going to face her?' She questioned looking at herself in the mirror for a second and coming face to face with the small charcoal stain on her cheek. ?You're so stupid.' She turned on the water and dampened the face cloth nearby before removing it. </p>
		<p>"Okay so the plan is, out of the bathroom, out of the door." The coward in her thought up an attack strategy and she found the rest of her agreeing to it quickly.</p>
		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>
		<p>As soon as the Slayer left Nicole dropped onto the floor dropping the sketches in a neat pile.</p>
		<p>?What the hell have you done?' She cursed herself as she meticulously picked up her various charcoals and put them neatly away in their case. </p>
		<p>?Talk to her.' She began to reason with herself. ?Explain.' She took a deep breath. ?Let her go, get her a cab and let her walk away, you've done enough.' The guilty part of her shouted loud and hard.</p>
		<p>"It's late I should get going and let you get to sleep." Buffy had stood in the living room door for along time waiting for Nicole to notice her, though the artist seemed totally absorbed in putting away her supplies. She reached down and took her bag slinging it over her shoulder.</p>
		<p>"Can't I get you a coffee? A soda?" Nicole kept her back turned and forced herself to put down her art case with a controlled move.</p>
		<p>"No, no I'm not thirsty." Buffy answered looking towards the door. "I'll talk to you later okay?" She tacked on awkwardly.</p>
		<p>"Buffy wait!" Nicole pushed up and turned around.</p>
		<p>"Yeah?" The Slayer hesitated shifting her weight anxiously from hip to hip.</p>
		<p>"You want to come round tomorrow, see what I've got?" She glanced at the pile of paper.</p>
		<p>"Sure." Buffy forced herself to smile. She cursed herself again as she realized that she'd totally misread what was going on. This wasn't about her, this was about the art. That's all it was. "What time?" She added casually.</p>
		<p>"Hey whenever you can fit me in, I'll be here all day, I like to wallow in what I've done." Nick almost laughed at the double meaning of her words.</p>
		<p>"I'll try to swing by before patrol." The Slayer took a step back. "Get some sleep though, don't let the art keep you up all night." She tried to joke though she felt it fall lamely from her lips.</p>
		<p>"Thanks Buffy, for everything." Nicole stood rather aimlessly in the room.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, right back at ya." Buffy gave her a short tight smile and then turned finding the doorknob quickly she pushed herself out into the night.</p>
		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>
		<p>Willow watched as Buffy, who had oddly enough shown up early on inventory day, slamming bottles of herbs around as she cleaned a shelf behind the counter. Casually she ran her feather duster over the line of books until she worked over to where Tara was unpacking supplies.</p>
		<p>"I think something went wrong." She whispered dusting the same spot over and over.</p>
		<p>"I think so." Tara leaned in close to agree.</p>
		<p>"What do we do?" Willow whispered back.</p>
		<p>"Well you could talk to her, find out what happened?" The blonde encouraged.</p>
		<p>"She talks to you more." Willow jumped slightly as they heard the Slayer slam another bottle down and curse.</p>
		<p>"She's your best friend Will, but in some ways about Nick, she has been rather? um talkative." Tara frowned quickly.</p>
		<p>"That's what I mean, Hellmouth stuff I'm number one but girl stuff..." Willow smiled. "I'm the best friend most likely not to be talked too instead choosing to talk to my girlfriend."</p>
		<p>"Does that mean ?Tara sweetie please talk to the Slayer'?" The blonde smiled with a twinkle in her eye.</p>
		<p>"Tara sweetie..." The hacker grinned. "Please talk to Buffy before she breaks something."</p>
		<p>"Anything for you." She reached over and kissed her cheek lightly. </p>
		<p>Tara quietly padded across the shop, her soft-soled shoes hardly making a noise on the floor.  It was strange but she suddenly wished she had put on her boots as normal, they made her feel more confident some how. As she approached the obviously antagonised Slayer the one thing she needed was confidence.</p>
		<p>"Err, hey Buffy." Tara spoke while she was still a way back. "I think Mr. Giles would rather the chicken feet stay in the jar and that the jar remains intact."  She pointed awkwardly to the jar that Buffy had recently slammed down.</p>
		<p>"What? Oh yeah." Buffy looked at the jar a bit lost.</p>
		<p>"Buffy, are you okay?" Tara frowned gently.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I mean where else could I be this morning other than doing free labour for Giles in his stupid shop?" Buffy slammed down another jar.</p>
		<p>"Please Buffy, the jars." Tara reached out her hand trying to give her friend a sympathetic look.  "What's wrong?" She added.</p>
		<p>"Sorry." Buffy let go and sighed heavily. "Had a bit of a mix up last night." She looked over to make sure Willow was engaged with her cleaning and sorting.</p>
		<p>"A mix up?" Tara moved a little closer.</p>
		<p>"You know the whole what if thing we talked about last night?"  Buffy waited for her to nod that she remembered. "Well let's just say it was a ?me if' thing and Nicole was just in it for the art."</p>
		<p>"Just in it for the art?" Tara's frown became more pronounced.</p>
		<p>"I did something really stupid Tara, cause I thought..." Buffy stopped and frowned. "It doesn't matter what I thought. Nicole was just being an artist, there was nothing real in any of it." She turned back to the jars picking one up softly.</p>
		<p>"Buffy please." Tara pleaded and almost reached out to touch the Slayer's arm. "Are you saying that Nicole turned you down?"</p>
		<p>"Considering I was naked and she was drawing me, I think turned down is the nice way of putting it." Buffy let her hand slip off the jar.</p>
		<p>"I... I... I honestly don't know what to say." The shy witch sympathised.</p>
		<p>"Don't say anything please, I feel stupid enough." Buffy shook her head, her eyes a little teary though she pushed it down. "It was just a getting over Riley thing, ya know?" She tried to make some sense of it. "No biggie."</p>
		<p>"What was a getting over Riley thing?" Tara questioned not understanding.</p>
		<p>"You are so sworn to secrecy." Buffy gave her a little look before saying anything else.</p>
		<p>"Of course." Tara agreed willingly.</p>
		<p>"We kissed." Buffy closed her eyes briefly feeling more than a little bit of embarrassment at her admittance, mostly cause the kiss had meant nothing. Here it was the big bad Slayer had kissed another woman, and it meant nothing.</p>
		<p>"You kissed?" Tara's voice came out a surprised whisper.</p>
		<p>"Yes." Buffy sighed. "But all part of want and need and art." She said the last word with contempt. </p>
		<p>"She said that?" Tara's frown never cleared.</p>
		<p>"Yep." Buffy shook her head laughing lightly. "Jokes on the straight girl." She turned back putting a bottle away gently.</p>
		<p>Tara was about to question the Slayer as to whether or not she was sure that Nicole had not wanted more but there was hardly any point after all that kind of things wasn't exactly easy to confuse.</p>
		<p>"It just..." Buffy was about to say more but she shook it off. "Where do the newt's eyes go?" She asked instead holding up the bottle.</p>
		<p>"Right there. Just what?" Tara pushed softly.</p>
		<p>"It doesn't matter." She shook her head.</p>
		<p>"It does Buffy, what?"</p>
		<p>"It was a nice kiss." Buffy gave her a sad smile and sighed. "But I guess that's better that what I usually get so, hey chalk up victory for the Slayer." </p>
		<p>"Have you spoken to her?" Tara couldn't believe what Buffy was saying.</p>
		<p>"God no." Buffy shook her head. "She said something last night about coming by to see the sketches but no way. I don't even want to see them."</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry Buffy, really, I don't know what to say."</p>
		<p>"Tara it's okay, it's not your fault." The Slayer gave her a brave smile. "Just how things go with me. You know that."</p>
		<p>"Don't think that." Tara shook her head. "There's someone for you Buffy, I know it."</p>
		<p>"Thanks Tara." Buffy smiled softly for the first time genuinely.</p>
		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>
		<p>"Tara!" Nicole pulled open the door to her apartment surprised to see the blonde Wicca waiting behind it in the hallway.</p>
		<p>"Nicole." Tara looked up through her hair</p>
		<p>"Come in, it's a bit of a mess but..." She moved out of the door to let Tara in and Tara moved quietly through</p>
		<p>"It's all right, I don't think I am going to be long." She said softly.</p>
		<p>"Oh." Nicole closed the door and followed her in. "What's wrong?" She asked seeing Tara's unusual body language.</p>
		<p>"To be honest?" The young witch turned and looked up at her. "You are." She decided to be blunt something that wasn't quite in her nature but in times when there were no other options she didn't have a choice.</p>
		<p>"What?" The artist looked at her lost and a little hurt.</p>
		<p>"What happened with Buffy?" Tara asked the question like she did indeed already know the answer.</p>
		<p>"Oh God Tara I wish I knew." Nicole moved backwards and sat down putting her hands in her hair. "I screwed up I think."</p>
		<p>"Screwed up?" Tara questioned, her initial anger just bubbling below the surface.</p>
		<p>"What did she tell you?" Nicole questioned sadly.</p>
		<p>"That you quite clearly stated that though she was ?nice' you saw her as a piece of art." Tara reiterated.</p>
		<p>"What?" Nicole looked up again completely shocked. "No! That's so not what I thought."</p>
		<p>"Isn't it?" Tara met the artist's shock with challenge.</p>
		<p>"No, I was drawing her and then we stopped and then we were kissing and she was naked and I was..." She got out of the chair and paced slightly. "I didn't want her to think it was some one night thing ya know? Some oh let me draw you, now let me sleep with you. I wanted to wait, I wanted to take her to dinner, make her laugh, let her get comfortable with the fact that I really, really like her."</p>
		<p>"And you did that by telling her she was good art?" Tara frowned.</p>
		<p>"I told her she was beautiful, and desirable. I never called her art." Nicole shook her head. "Tara I don't normally kiss my models, in fact I have NEVER kissed one of my models. That's why I thought we should stop, and cause she needs to be sure. I don't want to rush her."</p>
		<p>"Do you have any idea what Buffy was risking by kissing you?" Tara was suddenly annoyed beyond belief.</p>
		<p>"Tara, I didn't want to hurt her." Nicole tried to argue softly.</p>
		<p>"I think it's a bit late to worry about that." Tara took a little of the bite form her tone.</p>
		<p>"I know she was risking a lot, I know she's never been with a girl before." Nicole sat back down her voice soft and hurt.</p>
		<p>"Then why do it?  Why let her make a fool of herself?  Why throw all that trust in her face?" Tara dropped her anger completely and replaced it with genuine interest.</p>
		<p>"Cause I don't sleep with people I really like on the first date. I don't sleep with anyone on the first date." Nicole gave a crooked smile. "Did you sleep with Willow right away?"</p>
		<p>Tara remained silent for a moment and the dropped onto a chair with a soft laugh.</p>
		<p>"No, we didn't sleep together for?" She paused. "Months." She admitted with a smile.</p>
		<p>"I was trying to do what was right for her Tara, I didn't think she'd think I thought it was just a drawing session. God it was so much more than that, I mean you didn't see her she is so beautiful." Nicole sighed again. "And I so blew it."</p>
		<p>"You need to talk to her Nicole."  Tara looked up. "She's hurt and confused, but not lost to you."</p>
		<p>"She's not going to drop by is she?" The artist checked naively.  Tara shook her head honestly.  "Any ideas where I can find her?" She asked hopeful.</p>
		<p>"Willow managed to convince her into do some library work with her until patrol." Tara replied she glanced at her watch. "You may catch her there still."</p>
		<p>"Tara, thanks for giving me a chance to explain." Nicole stood up moving over to put on her runners.</p>
		<p>"Be careful, she's not as tough as she makes out." Tara warned softly.</p>
		<p>"Thanks." Nicole nodded again grabbing a jacket and racing out.</p>
		<p>"I'll lock up." Tara called after the retreating artist laughing at the fact that she'd abandoned her apartment without a care.</p>
		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>
		<p>Nicole had stopped running by the time she reached the library, and the stern scowl she got from the librarian made her slow her fast walk to an ordinary one. She looked around the tall stacks trying to catch a glimpse of either Buffy or Willow. After a short search she caught sight of the dipped blonde head and began her approach pulling at her jacket nervously. She moved up to the table where Buffy was reading, checking that Willow wasn't around.</p>
		<p>"Willow, I don't get this whole...." The Slayer looked up expecting the hacker but stopping short when she saw the artist.</p>
		<p>"Buffy." Nicole said the simple word softly.</p>
		<p>"Nicole." She repeated back in the same tone.</p>
		<p>"Can we talk?" Nicole leaned forward and put her hands on the desk.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, of course." Buffy closed the book putting her pen in to keep her place.</p>
		<p>"We should go outside, I think I managed to upset her already." She motioned to the librarian who hovered close by.</p>
		<p>"Let me leave Will a note." Buffy jotted down a quick ?be right back' to the hacker so she wouldn't worry and then stood up waiting for the artist to lead.</p>
		<p>Nicole watched her avidly and then back away from the desk turning to move she took a few steps away to the entrance.  Buffy moved behind her a reasonable distance smiling at the agitated librarian. She let Nicole open the door as they moved outside to the front steps.</p>
		<p>"Buffy, I need to explain something..." Nicole stopped on the top step, before moving down a couple to the next small landing.  Buffy wrapped her arms around herself and waited as she very slowly followed. "Something about last night." She struggled.</p>
		<p>"Look it's okay, I understand." Buffy shook her head stepping up one step to retreat. "I hope the pictures were worth it."</p>
		<p>"No Buffy you don't." Nicole reached out towards the Slayer. "The pictures?" She began. "The pictures are great, but only because they are of you." She dropped her voice low.</p>
		<p>"If I look good it's your skill Nicole." Buffy answered stepping back down a bit.</p>
		<p>"No it's not, Buffy." Nick made her voice calm and controlled. "You look good, because you are beautiful." She softened the toned looking up into Buffy's eyes.</p>
		<p>"I'm sure you didn't run all the way over here to just tell me that." The Slayer found her own voice soft as well as she stared into deep brown eyes.</p>
		<p>"No, I ran all the way over here because I wanted to explain what happened." She took a quick breath. "Buffy, I didn't want to be a classic art student, you know bad lines, and taking advantage of beautiful models. Not with you." She rubbed her hands on her pants. "Not that I ever do that." She corrected with a small blush.</p>
		<p>"Hey I know no one, male or female, wants to date the slayer." Buffy shrugged digging the toe of her boot into the stone step.</p>
		<p>"No, you see?" Nicole made a half step forward her hand reaching out towards Buffy's arm before it stopped.  "You see that's where you're wrong. That's exactly what I want to do."</p>
		<p>"What?" Buffy pushed the word out a bit surprised. All of her arguments, all of her well-planned reasons were killed with the girl's one statement.</p>
		<p>"I want to date you Buffy, I wanna buy you flowers, and mochas, take you to the movies and hold your hand around campus." Nick began rambling. "I want to watch you resting, working and studying. I want to learn everything I can about you Buffy Summers."</p>
		<p>"Are you asking me out Nicole?" Buffy asked her rather stupidly for clarification. Nicole chuckled softly and nodded.</p>
		<p>"I guess I'm arty with my words to huh?" She shrugged softly and blinked her brown eyes</p>
		<p>"But last night..." The Slayer motioned behind her as if to point out the past. "You weren't interested."</p>
		<p>"Buffy last night I wanted you, I wanted to? God I wanted to." Nicole stopped and took a slightly self-conscious look around after all they were on campus in the middle of the day.</p>
		<p>"And you didn't cause?" Buffy stepped a bit closer as she questioned and a group of students went up the stairs nearby.</p>
		<p>"I didn't because, I realised what I wanted to do last night, I wanted to do with you not as a one off thing, and not when the time wasn't perfect. I didn't want you to wake up and regret anything." Nicole explained her actions.</p>
		<p>"Did I come on too strong?" Buffy asked suddenly worried about something else completely. After all here was this gorgeous creature, grovelling before her, telling her that though she'd wanted nothing better than to ravish the slayer silly, she'd drummed up enough control because she felt so much already. There had to be something wrong with her then, she started to figure.</p>
		<p>"No Buffy no," Nicole moved closer and put her hand on Buffy's upper arm, stroking it lightly "Oh God this sounds stupid." She whispered almost angry with herself. "Buffy?" She cleared her throat a little as Buffy bit her bottom lip waiting for her to continue. "You wanna go to the Bronze with me, tonight?" She asked suddenly.</p>
		<p>"I have to patrol but I can meet you afterwards." Buffy answered immediately, almost in a rush. "Say 10:30ish?"</p>
		<p>"Perfect." The artist smiled broadly.</p>
		<p>"Great." Buffy smiled back at her.</p>
		<p>"I suppose I should let you get back, you know studying." Nicole took a step back and looked down the steps.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, Will..."Buffy motioned to the building.  "She's a worrier."</p>
		<p>"Could I possibly..." Nicole began but stopped herself.</p>
		<p>"Possibly?" Buffy questioned blinking a few times.</p>
		<p>"Kiss your cheek or something?" Nicole nearly cringed at how lame she sounded. The Slayer blushed slightly and nodded. Swallowing quickly, wiping her instantly hot and clammy hands on her pants again Nicole leaned forward and pressed her lips against Buffy's cheek surprised at how chilled they were against her warm lips.</p>
		<p>"I'll see you at the bronze." Buffy whispered.</p>
		<p>"Ten thirty."  Nicole whispered back.</p>
		<p>Buffy waited till the artist had begun to pull back before she leaned forward pressing their lips together for the briefest second.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, ten thirty." The Slayer grinned backing up the steps.</p>
		<p>"See you then!" Nicole waved rather stupidly, grinning inanely she leaned back on the metal bar.</p>
		<p>Buffy waved back before turning and basically floating inside. She barely noticed that the hacker was again studying at their table as she slipped into her seat looking a bit unfocused.</p>
		<p>"Hey." Willow said tentatively.</p>
		<p>"Hey. Buffy smiled and opened her book rather absently.</p>
		<p>"Is everything okay?" Willow lifted her pen off her notepad.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, it's great." Buffy picked up her pencil twirling it.</p>
		<p>"Did I miss something?" The redhead asked frowning lightly.</p>
		<p>"Isn't it funny how things can get so mixed up when really they are so perfect?" Buffy didn't really ask the hacker and as she realized what she was doing she shook her head. "Sorry Willow, spacey Buff." She grinned.</p>
		<p>"Kinda noticed." Willow admitted. "Does a best friend get an explanation?"</p>
		<p>"I have a date tonight." The Slayer smiled shyly.</p>
		<p>"Oh a date!" Willow flicked her book closed and gave her best friend full attention. "Who, who?"</p>
		<p>"Didn't Tara tell you?" Buffy looked at her best friend a bit surprised.</p>
		<p>"Tara knows about your date? What is this arrange things without Willow day?" Willow put on a mock pout.</p>
		<p>"Will..." Buffy closed her book again and shifted in her seat, she then leaned forward her voice low to hide her words from the other library patrons. "It's with Nicole."</p>
		<p>"Nicole the cute artist?" Willow squeaked happy and surprised.</p>
		<p>"Yes, Nicole the very cute artist." Buffy grinned. "Are you freaked out?" She asked suddenly worried.</p>
		<p>"No." She coughed and lowered the note of her voice. "No, it's just from the magic shop this morning I thought, well I guessed that things hadn't gone well. And then with Tara just up and leaving me to go I'm not sure where?"</p>
		<p>"Oh God Willow, it was such a mess." Buffy sighed." I thought she didn't like me, but really its cause she didn't want to be all one night stand-ish."</p>
		<p>"So something happened?" Willow leaned forward again.</p>
		<p>"We kissed." Buffy tilted her head slightly as she made the admission.</p>
		<p>"Kiss kissed?" Willow asked for definition.</p>
		<p>"Yes, kiss kissed." Buffy looked down into her book with a laugh. "And I was naked."</p>
		<p>"Naked!" Willow's word was a shocked whisper.</p>
		<p>"For a drawing." Buffy filled in quickly. "She was sketching me, that's all... then well we kissed."</p>
		<p>"Do I want to hear the details?" Willow checked with a slight blush. "I mean I do but am I being all like Xander wanting to know too much?"</p>
		<p>"No." Buffy shook her head. "She was telling me how free it felt to pose, and we worked up to it... the naked bit that is." She smiled. "Then we kissed and then it went horribly wrong cause she pulled back and I thought it was cause she didn't like me."</p>
		<p>"But she does like you?" Willow felt a bit confused, she just couldn't picture Buffy poising nude for anyone.</p>
		<p>"She said she didn't want it to be all ?oh pose for me, wham bam thank you Buffy'." She tried to explain. "She wants to buy me flowers and mochas and go on dates and stuff." She stopped. "Like a real relationship." She froze for a moment. "Willow, I'm the slayer, I can't have a real relationship."</p>
		<p>"Hold on Buffy." Willow frowned, as her best friend seemed to veer off her happy ride.</p>
		<p>"But look at the evidence..." She scowled more. "I've dated a three hundred year old vampire, an super vitamin rich army commando and a guy I swear had hypnotic go to be with powers.  What kinda record is that?"</p>
		<p>"A mixed one?" Willow tried helpfully.</p>
		<p>"It's horrible." Buffy put her head down on her book.</p>
		<p>"Well you're still young." The redhead's words sounded painful to her own ears.</p>
		<p>"I should just give up, join a nunnery or something." Buffy shook her head.</p>
		<p>"Oh you're both still here." Tara's almost disappointed voice suddenly rang in both the hacker's and the Slayer's ears.</p>
		<p>"Yes, still here. Pathetic slayer who can't hope to have a real relationship." Buffy didn't raise her forehead from the cover of her American history book.</p>
		<p>"But I thought Nicole was coming here?" Tara frowned ever more as she looked between the two other women.</p>
		<p>"She was here." Willow filled in. "They have a date tonight." She frowned.</p>
		<p>"Oh okay." Tara leaned on her back foot still frowning. "But then why?" She mentioned to the forlorn Slayer.</p>
		<p>"Cause she's worried with all the past not so great relationship evidence that her and Nicole are doomed." Willow kept frowning and the Slayer sighed. "I tried to tell her she was young when she dated Angel, I mean he was all broody and handsome what girl could resist? Even if he did try to kill us all and went mental." She stopped.</p>
		<p>Tara's facial expression didn't change so much as grew more confused and worried.</p>
		<p>"And Riley hey he wasn't undead, he was a great guy, well accept for the whole initiative thing and the tampering with his chemistry and the half man half machine guy." Willow looked at her girlfriend. "Oh and the guy who hypnotized her into sleeping with him, but I tell you I gave him a good tongue lashing I did." She nodded thinking back to cave Buffy night.</p>
		<p>"Er not wanting to s-s-sound out against what you're saying Will." Tara smiled lovingly at Willow and then bravely at Buffy.</p>
		<p>"Sound away Tara." Buffy moved her chin up into her hands. "How much worse could it get?  At least I didn't date the judge."</p>
		<p>"Or Spike." Willow threw in hopefully.</p>
		<p>"I-I-I thought I was a half demon, and I-I still found Willow." Tara slid her hand under the table and found Willow's fingers to intertwine them.</p>
		<p>"Yeah but you two are special, I mean even dumb slayer me can see that." Buffy smiled a little at them. "All lucky in love, face the brave new world, rage against the dying of the light kinda special."</p>
		<p>"I-I-I don't think it matters much who you are Buffy. It has nothing to do with luck either, it's all to do with that other word, love." Tara pointed out softly.</p>
		<p>"I'm meeting her at the Bronze tonight." The Slayer looked at the blonde.</p>
		<p>"Then focus on that, I-I might not know a lot Buffy but I do know that Nicole isn't Angel or Riley." Tara pointed out gently. "I think she deserves a chance at least."</p>
		<p>"You promise she's just Canadian?" Buffy smiled. "Not some long lost snake goddess or demon from the third hell dimension?"</p>
		<p>"Probably 100% maple syrup underneath." Willow grinned and put in the idea.</p>
		<p>"That I can handle, I do pancakes." Buffy grinned back a bit more upbeat.</p>
		<p align="center">~*~*~*~</p>
		<p>For the thousandth time Buffy brushed down the patterned heavy skirt she wore. A tall pair of dark brown calf boots and a frilly open necked shirt smartly complimented it. She'd bailed a bit early out of patrol to meet Tara and Willow for a wardrobe consultation and after much fanfare they'd all agreed this was perfect. Trying not to feel like everyone in the bar was watching her she walked slowly through the crowd looking for the artist.</p>
		<p>Finally as the crowd shifted she spotted the tall brunette sitting on a stool near a tiny table looking very nervous. </p>
		<p>?Just as nervous as I feel by the looks of it.' Buffy decided as she appraised Nicole's outfit.  The artist was in a pair of flared cords. Shiny laced boots peaking out from under the low hem. A small fluffy navy thermal vest sat over a long sleeved black shirt, which was spattered in the front with a sparkly shooting star. Buffy fluffed out the cuffs of her shirt before making a confident beeline to the table.</p>
		<p>"Hi." She announced as she got close and the artist looked up at her.</p>
		<p>"Buffy." Nicole said somewhat pointlessly after all who else had she been waiting for.  She pushed herself off her stool and stood awkwardly with her hands by her sides.</p>
		<p>"Nicole." Buffy said her name back smiling, as she looked the artist up and down again.  "You look really nice."</p>
		<p>"You too, really nice, I mean is this so you attract the vampires?" She laughed softly cursing herself for initially thinking the slayer had dressed up for her.</p>
		<p>"I could never slay in this skirt." The Slayer pointed out practically. "I changed silly." She eased and playfully swatted the brunette's arm.</p>
		<p>"Oh yes, of course." Nicole shook her head feeling even more stupid.</p>
		<p>"Is this how you wander around normally?" Buffy's hand almost went to reach for the sparkles that ran across her chest but she pulled herself back.</p>
		<p>"No, it'd get all chalky and messy you know." The artist moved her hand back and forth aimlessly as she spoke.</p>
		<p>"Are you waiting for like the host of blind date to jump out and ask us how it's going so far?" Buffy grinned at their collective nervousness.</p>
		<p>"You want to sit? Can I get you a drink?" Nicole laughed and nodded.</p>
		<p>"A drink would be great." Buffy pushed up to sit in the other stool.</p>
		<p>"Coke? Beer?" Nicole looked for directions.</p>
		<p>"Coke." The slayer nodded.</p>
		<p>Nicole nodded and hurried off to return moments later with two cokes. She put them on the small table and pushed herself up onto the free stool.</p>
		<p>"So was tonight okay patrol wise?" Nicole began smiling gently.</p>
		<p>"Very." Buffy nodded. "Two vampires less in Sunnydale."</p>
		<p>"Makes a girl feel safer." The brunette noted.</p>
		<p>"Don't worry I would never let anything hurt you." Buffy said seriously.</p>
		<p>Nicole leaned in and held one of the glasses towards Buffy. Buffy nodded her thanks as she took it and had a sip.</p>
		<p>"So you like to dance?" Nicole nodded toward the throng.</p>
		<p>"I do." Buffy smiled. "Do you?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I mean I'm not like worlds best dancer or anything." Nicole shrugged gently. "But I can feel a good rhythm."</p>
		<p>"Oh that's disappointing, Tara told me you were a world class dancer." Buffy grinned.</p>
		<p>"I'll have to do something about that snitching witch." Nicole laughed.</p>
		<p>"Well you don't want to piss the witches off cause she'll put a spell on you." Buffy laughed and wiggled her fingers at the brunette.</p>
		<p>"You know I find it very hard to be frightened by the thought of a Tara spell."</p>
		<p>"I think unless you did something to hurt Willow then you wouldn't have to worry about anything more than a extra chocolate chip cookie spell." Buffy smiled.</p>
		<p>"So when you say you like to dance, does that mean you wanna dance now?" Nicole asked shyly looking down to the table.</p>
		<p>"Sure." Buffy stood up.</p>
		<p>"Great." Nicole slid off her own stool.</p>
		<p>"Lead on." Buffy held out her hand.</p>
		<p>"Oh yeah, okay." Nicole nodded and moved through the crowd Buffy stood there for a moment with her hand limply in the air before just following her onto the dance floor.</p>
		<p>"I didn't even think to ask if you liked the song." Nicole apologised over the heavy bass beat as she moved into an easy movement with the song keep her distance from the blonde but watching her every move.</p>
		<p>"No, no it's lovely." Buffy moved a bit closer tying to hear.</p>
		<p>"I don't suppose you get much free time to enjoy this kind of thing." The artist continued trying to talk over the song though she wasn't sure why.</p>
		<p>"I try to do it as much as I can." Buffy admitted. "Do you?"</p>
		<p>"Well you know Chris wasn't into ?the scene' too much."  She grimaced the moment she mentioned her ex's name. </p>
		<p>"Too bad..." Buffy smiled. "You're a great dancer."</p>
		<p>"You too, I mean you look great dancing, the way you move." Nicole found herself staring and concentrating less on her own movements that became little more than a sway.</p>
		<p>"What?" Buffy was only catching bits and pieces of the girl's words and moved even closer.</p>
		<p>"I said I love the way you move." Nicole leaned in and spoke closer to Buffy's ear. "When you're dancing." She added hurriedly.</p>
		<p>"I love the way you move too." The Slayer shivered as she felt the brunette's breath on her neck.</p>
		<p>"I..." Nicole said loudly when suddenly the song changed to a slower quieter number, the artist blushed slightly at starting so loudly and she lower her voice before continuing. "I could watch you move forever."</p>
		<p>"That would be nice." Buffy nodded shivering slightly, noting the change in music herself.</p>
		<p>"I?" Nicole began again as she moved so close to Buffy that her hand grazed against the Slayer's side as she moved to the soft rhythm. "I'm glad you came."</p>
		<p>"So am I." Buffy slid a bit closer to her.</p>
		<p>Nicole was about to slide her hand forward to rest on Buffy's hip, when she reminded herself of where they were and who she was with.  Her mind also quickly reminded her that this was their first date and she was a girl she wasn't sure Buffy was ready to be seen dancing ?with' another woman just yet.</p>
		<p>"It's okay."</p>
		<p>"W-what?" Nicole blinked at the blonde.</p>
		<p>Buffy put her hand over the one in the air holding it as they swayed slightly to the music.</p>
		<p>She must have heard the song a thousand or more times and never paid much attention to it before, but right here and now in the low lights with the slow bass and solo electric guitar literally surrounding her body and mind with Buffy standing so close to her that she would have sworn she could feel the blonde's heart beating, Nicole actually listened to the words.</p>
		<p>"And brushes her long blond hair, and then she asked me do I look alright and I say yes, you look wonderful tonight." Mr. Clapton sung, his mellow tones expressing Nicole's very thoughts.</p>
		<p>Without thinking Nicole stepped even closer and moved her other hand to rest on Buffy's hip.</p>
		<p>Buffy closed her eyes as with the sound of the soft music they melted together more. The rest of the bar seemed to melt away. Her arms went up as she loosely held the brunette's neck.</p>
		<p>Nicole truly believed at that moment there was a heaven, and some how she had stumbled right in through the door as she slipped both hands fully round the Slayer's back linking her hand to her own wrist as she encircle the slim frame easily bringing her head to rest against the side of soft blonde hair. Buffy felt every tired muscle, every nervous feeling inside her relaxed as she felt the artist's arms go around her. Without persuasion or force Nicole led the to of them in a slow gentle rocking circle as the songs melody continued.</p>
		<p>Nicole didn't know who to thank more, the DJ or the romantic sap that had requested the songs as Eric Clapton melted into Sarah Mclachlan's version of Unchained Melody.</p>
		<p>"You know I think your amazing Buffy." Nicole whispered into soft blonde.</p>
		<p>"You know when you say it, I believe it could be true." Buffy whispered back nestling in a bit closer.</p>
		<p>"You should." Nicole gave a gentle squeeze.</p>
		<p>"Keep telling me and I'll try." The Slayer commented softly.</p>
		<p>"Hey, hey what's this? Red's tendencies rubbed off on you Slayer!" Spike's condescending voice cut through the songstress' voice. "Got yourself a hottie to try have you?"</p>
		<p>Nicole instantly stopped their gentle sway but didn't release her grip as Buffy's body immediately went stiff.</p>
		<p>"Spike, unless you want to end your pathetic undead life I suggest you leave now." Buffy didn't turn. "I'm sorry." She apologized to her date.</p>
		<p>"Hey I'm not saying I blame you, but isn't Red gonna feel its all a bit of a ?if you can be gay I can be gay' thing?" The vampire glowed with boastful arrogance.</p>
		<p>Buffy pulled back looking in brown eyes for a moment before slowly turning. Nicole eased her grip effective releasing the Slayer from her arms.</p>
		<p>"Shut up or I'm going to use you to clean the dance floor." She glared at him standing protectively in front of Nicole.</p>
		<p>"Oh touchy slayer." Spike gave a little jump and held up his fists in a mock battle pose. "You know you'd never do it." He jeered.</p>
		<p>"Come on Nicole, he's harmless." She took a deep breath and then reached back grabbing her date's hand and leading her away.</p>
		<p>"Oh yeah that's right walk away from me!" Spike called perusing the two of them as they left the dance floor. "She's no Agent Finn Slayer."  The peroxide vamp looked Nicole up and down slowly.</p>
		<p>"Again I am so sorry." Buffy stopped again and Nicole shook her head though the whole scene made her feel more than uneasy.</p>
		<p>Buffy smiled at Nicole before she hiked her skirt up a little and turned hitting Spike firmly in the head with a spin kick which sent him down.</p>
		<p>"Ow! Well that was uncalled for." Spike leaned heavily up on one knee raising his hand to pat at the trail of blood from his lip, which had split from the sharp heel.</p>
		<p>"Unless you have something nice to say then don't even dare to open your mouth." Buffy barked at him. "This is my date, I won't have you or anyone comparing her to anything.  Got me?"</p>
		<p>"Okay got the message." He pushed up off the floor and held up his hands in mock surrender. "Though I was wondering you know later, can I sneak by and watch?" </p>
		<p>Nicole groaned and lowered her head, flushing deep crimson.  Buffy raised her fist to him almost ready to strike.</p>
		<p>"I'll take that as a no." Spike backed off a little. "Hey hottie, don't place bets on this date, you haven't got what Buffy needs." He called before disappearing into the crowd.</p>
		<p>Nicole said nothing she merely kept her head down.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry."  Buffy turned feeling huge amounts of tension in her shoulders. When she saw the brunette's head down she frowned.</p>
		<p>"No, no it's okay." Nicole didn't move apart from shaking her brown locks.</p>
		<p>"He's just a bastard vampire." Buffy moved closer and slowly put her hand on Nicole's cheek to guide her face up.</p>
		<p>"Hostile-17 I believe." Nicole let her head be guided but didn't make eye contact.</p>
		<p>"Hostile, bitchy premenstrual 17." She tried to joke. "Nic, what he said isn't true." She added softly.</p>
		<p>"Which bit?" The Canadian asked sadly.</p>
		<p>"First off I'll never let him so much as watch us hold hands." Buffy tried to get her to hold eye contact. "Secondly I am not copying Willow, or trying out a hottie, even though you are very hot, for the record." She stroked her finger down Nicole's cheek. "And thirdly, Spike doesn't know a damn thing about what I need."</p>
		<p>"We have lectures in the morning, I should get you home." Nicole looked up past Buffy to their coats and drinks.</p>
		<p>"Okay." Buffy conceded with a sigh.</p>
		<p>*******</p>
		<p>Buffy kept her arms around her body as they slowly made their way down the sidewalk. They hadn't said much since the bar. Spike's had put a damper on the evening to say the least. Buffy rethought every word, every action she'd taken and hated the peroxide vampire more. She made a vague plan in her head to go beat the crap out of him near the dawn just to make herself feel a bit better.</p>
		<p>"So, do you think you will come round and see the sketches, I think I have chosen the one I am going to work into a finished piece." Nicole said as they walked keeping her eyes on the sidewalk dead ahead of her.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, of course." Buffy nodded and then suddenly drew her feet to a stop. "Okay, this is when the date-o-meter comes up and Spike's interlude makes it go to what a three or a two?" She tried to get Nicole to say something.  Nicole stopped instantly hearing Buffy's footsteps end.</p>
		<p>"Date-o-meter?" Nicole frowned her eyes barely leaving the tarmac.</p>
		<p>"There's this show, friend's set you up on dates and then they follow you around with camera's and tape you." The Slayer explained.</p>
		<p>"Guess I must have missed it." Nicole admitted with a shrug.</p>
		<p>"Nic, I'm sorry." Buffy's voice was sad. "He's undead, he's got bad timing... I mean it was so nice dancing."</p>
		<p>"Yeah the dancing was very nice." A small smile crept onto the artist's face.</p>
		<p>"So..." Buffy smiled and took a slight step closer. "Do I look alright?" She remembered the words of the song.</p>
		<p>"You look wonderful Buffy." Nicole looked Buffy up and down fully and then eased her fingertips into the hair at the Slayer's temple pushing back through it gently loosing herself momentarily in the Slayer's eyes.</p>
		<p>"Can I be pushy already and say I like it a lot better when you look at me?" Buffy leaned into her hand.</p>
		<p>"Of course you can." Nicole smiled. "I like looking at you better than the sidewalk to."</p>
		<p>"You okay?" Buffy reached out taking her other hand. The artist nodded though not with 100% conviction.</p>
		<p>"Are you?" She queried.</p>
		<p>"Come on now, I know when I'm only getting 76% of a nod." Buffy rubbing her fingers over the back of Nicole's hand as the artist shrugged.  "Please Nic." Buffy pushed softly.</p>
		<p>"It's nothing." Nicole shook it off. "I guess I shouldn't let badly dyed vampires get to me."</p>
		<p>"How did he get to you?" Buffy's voice was soft and she reached up tracing the brunette's chin.</p>
		<p>"Nothing. It's a bit chilly to just be stood Buffy, we should get you back." Nicole didn't flinch away from Buffy's touch but she didn't lean into it either</p>
		<p>"Please, talk to me.  We had enough of a screw up last night when we didn't talk things out." Buffy moved even closer.</p>
		<p>"Got to me as in he's right, I'm no Riley." Nicole whispered.</p>
		<p>"No, you're not." Buffy agreed. "But I'm not with Riley anymore and the one thing you have proved to me is that I don't want to be with him anymore." She stopped her hand holding brown eyes. "I'm trying to make a start with you."</p>
		<p>"Buffy I..." Nicole started and then breathed deeply. "Can I buy you coffee tomorrow?" She finished with a smile.</p>
		<p>"Only if I can buy you a muffin." Buffy smiled back.</p>
		<p>"Only if they have blueberry." Nic teased.</p>
		<p>"Blueberry for my blueberry." Buffy smiled and then licked her lips as she realized what she'd said.</p>
		<p>"What?" Nicole screwed her nose up and looked at the Slayer.</p>
		<p>"Blueberry muffin for my big blueberry artist." Buffy repeated and laughed at the face she was getting.</p>
		<p>"Did someone forget to tell me that you go slightly crazy after eleven?" Nicole wound her fingers around Buffy's hand laughing.</p>
		<p>"You should blame the crazy blonde witch." Buffy grinned wildly.</p>
		<p>"Why?" The Canadian just watched Buffy's face with pleasure.</p>
		<p>"For not telling you I get slightly crazy after eleven." Buffy kept grinning. "You should see me after twelve."</p>
		<p>"Now I'm getting just a little scared!" Nick laughed louder. "Come on you lets get you home."</p>
		<p>"Yeah lets go." Buffy held her hand tightly and started down the street.</p>
		<p>*******</p>
		<p>Willow picked up her full steaming frothy mocha and blew over the creamy coloured chocolate sprinkled foam and then looked over at her best friend who was busy demolishing a blueberry muffin.</p>
		<p>"I didn't know you liked them." She nodded looking at the partially eaten cake.</p>
		<p>"I didn't, but Nic loves them and she's always having one when we meet for breakfast so I..." Buffy smiled. "Sorta acquired the taste."</p>
		<p>"Oh I see, and how many breakfasts have you met for now, I've lost track." The hacker admitted smiling broadly at the Slayer's admission.</p>
		<p>"I don't count." Buffy's smile softened as she chewed on a piece of muffin. "Okay so twelve in the last two weeks." She grinned.</p>
		<p>"Oh this is so exciting." Willow enthused she reached out and patted Buffy's hand. "So it's going well?" She asked, her eyes sparkling.</p>
		<p>"Nicole and I were thinking, the four of us should go out for a movie or something. That new Sandra Bullock flick is opening on Friday." Buffy nodded to her best friend.</p>
		<p>"A double date, wow, a double date with my best friend and her girlfriend, wow, I mean could things be any better than this?"  Willow beamed.</p>
		<p>"Will, can I ask you a question?" Buffy began slowly turning her spoon over and over in her mocha.</p>
		<p>"You know apart from maybe studying as a foursome, or you know sorting out some new organisational rotation for the shop?" She rambled on.</p>
		<p>"Willow, Will!" Buffy reached over to run a hand past the hacker's gaze.</p>
		<p>"What? Oh yes sorry Buffy." Willow gave her best friend an apologetic smile.</p>
		<p>"We're not quite you and Tara level yet. That's sorta what I wanted to talk to you about. If you can focus long enough before you have us having a double wedding." Buffy laughed.</p>
		<p>"Oh Goddess a double hand fasting." The redhead's eyes glazed over.</p>
		<p>"WILLOW!" Buffy laughed and kept stirring. "You'd think you'd been planning this me and a girl thing for ages." She laughed softly.</p>
		<p>"OH no Buffy, I don't think about your sexuality.  I mean that would be wrong wouldn't it?  I mean I did, that is, I didn't you know when you were going out with Riley it was a bit hard not to think about, you know, with the two of you kinda." Willow babbled going brighter red by the second.</p>
		<p>"Will, I get the picture." The Slayer smiled.</p>
		<p>"Okay so back to best friend dilemma, what can I do to help?" Willow smiled happily and gave her best helping face to Buffy.</p>
		<p>"Okay, so, well... you know." Buffy stammered trying to find a way to begin.</p>
		<p>"I know?" Willow frowned taking a sip of mocha.</p>
		<p>"You and Tara, I know I didn't always know and?" She briefly looked up at Willow. "And I'm sorry about being stupid at first, ya know, but like..." She took a worried bite of her muffin.</p>
		<p>"You want to come out to Giles? And Xander?" Willow quizzed.</p>
		<p>"No, God no I haven't even thought of that." Buffy's eyes when wide and worried. "It was more the sex bit." Her words were almost silent. Willow nearly sprayed the Slayer with mocha foam "I'll shut up now, pretend I didn't ask." Buffy looked down in her drink as the hacker reacted.</p>
		<p>"No, no Buffy I'm sorry." Willow started shaking her head and spluttering a little. "No, it's perfectly okay to ask about, well you know, that."</p>
		<p>"It's more like a lack of that." Buffy admitted. "I mean is a lack of that normal at first? Did you and Tara have a lack of that?"</p>
		<p>"Well yeah, for a while Tara and I didn't, that. And then we did, and after we had, well you know, we really liked, that." Willow blustered.</p>
		<p>"Well Tara had had that before you right?" Buffy questioned softly and carefully. "And you hadn't had that kind of that, so did you start the that or did she?" She realized how stupid the question seemed.</p>
		<p>"Well I had had that, but not with, well not with someone like Tara, I mean Oz and I, well had that." Willow's face was nearly as red as her hair.</p>
		<p>"No I know you and Oz had that, I mean I've had that with Riley and Angel like you said." Buffy cut in turning pink herself. "But with Tara, the whole that thing, with you never having had Tara type that."</p>
		<p>"Oh I wanted that with Tara, like really early." Willow stated looking up nodding a bit.</p>
		<p>"But?" Buffy leaned forward.</p>
		<p>"But I didn't know you know." She stumbled a bit and looked back down into her drink.</p>
		<p>"Know how to go about it?" Buffy filled in taking a sip of her own.</p>
		<p>"Know more if Tara wanted that." Willow replied awkwardly. "I was, well and she's so?"</p>
		<p>"Oh. And how did you find out if she did?" Buffy pushed.</p>
		<p>"Well I didn't that is I wanted you know to do lots of pre-checks, you know an assessment of the situation." The hacker explained.</p>
		<p>"What kind of pre-checks?" Buffy questioned.</p>
		<p>"I had a list of them, in coloured pens." Willow smiled.</p>
		<p>"Willow, it's been three great weeks and?" The Slayer tried to explain.</p>
		<p>"And you want that?" Willow offered looking down.</p>
		<p>"Am I wrong to want that?" Buffy bit her lip. "I mean what we have now is great, I mean wonderful, but ya know."</p>
		<p>"Oh no, no, no way, it's not wrong to want that." Willow shook her head determined. "That is a very wonderful and important thing."</p>
		<p>"So what pre-checks?" Buffy questioned going back to the hacker's comments. "To make sure she wants that."</p>
		<p>"I thought you two were having a quick mocha and then going to the library." A new voice cut in and Willow looked up to see the unmistakable figure of her girlfriend moving over towards them.</p>
		<p>"We were, see mocha." Buffy picked up her drink looking incredibly guilty. "Just a mocha eh Will? Innocent mocha between best friends."</p>
		<p>"Very mocha, very innocent." Willow nodded.</p>
		<p>"Avoiding study is what it looks like." The blonde witch smiled and slid into the booth beside her girlfriend.</p>
		<p>"You caught us." Buffy smiled as she sat down.</p>
		<p>"So what are you to chatting about?" Tara asked stealing a sip of Willow's mocha as she looked between the two of them and watched them both freeze.  "Oh is it a secret?" She asked when neither replied.</p>
		<p>"No, of course not." Buffy shook her head awkwardly.</p>
		<p>"H-h-have I interrupted something?" She suddenly stammered, her age old uncertainty kicked in even after Buffy's words.</p>
		<p>"Couldn't have a secret from you, could we Willow? We were just talking about Nicole and I."  She added hastily when Tara stuttered.</p>
		<p>"No, no secrets baby." Willow slipped her hand over to cover Tara's</p>
		<p>"Just discussing how the four of us should go to that new movie on Friday." Buffy filled in.</p>
		<p>"Sandra Bullock." Willow emphasised.</p>
		<p>"That's the one." Buffy smiled. "A good wholesome night of Sandra Bullock fighting crime."</p>
		<p>"I think that's a lovely idea." Tara agreed still glancing between the pair not certain that she still wasn't missing something.</p>
		<p>"Do you want a mocha?" Buffy asked suddenly. "I know you and Will like to share, but I could get you one and you could share both of them?"</p>
		<p>"I can get one." Tara replied with a shrug.</p>
		<p>"No, no, let me." Buffy darted out of the booth. "I want to get another muffin." </p>
		<p>"Hi love." Willow waited a few awkward seconds before she leaned over and kissed the blonde's cheek.</p>
		<p>"So what did I interrupt?" Tara asked softly.</p>
		<p>"Buffy was asking..." Willow gulped and looked over to make sure the Slayer was far away in the line-up for coffee. "About snugglies."</p>
		<p>"Snugglies?" Tara leaned in a little closer.</p>
		<p>"You know..." Willow put an arm around her back. "Special snugglies."</p>
		<p>"Buffy was asking you about our snugglies?" There was an element of shock and almost horror to Tara's voice.</p>
		<p>"Not really our snugglies, just snugglies in general." Willow shook her head to the worry. "How long before snugglies, who should start the snugglies? I think there is a lack of Buffy and Nicole snugglies." She smiled sadly.</p>
		<p>"Oh I see." Tara replied. "Buffy wants to make love to Nicole." She stated simply.</p>
		<p>"Yeah." Willow coughed turning red.</p>
		<p>"And did you tell her how perfect and wonderful and great it is, and that she should just move with the feeling one of these nights? Just like you did." The blonde continued.</p>
		<p>"Um not so much." Willow put her head on the blonde's shoulder. "We sorta didn't get much said." She looked up into blue eyes, playing her fingers over the blonde's leg. "Maybe you should talk to her." She smiled.</p>
		<p>"Me?" Tara smiled. "Of course I don't mind."</p>
		<p>"You're so much better at this stuff, I just go red and get all tongue tied and we end up calling it ?that' for twenty minutes." She tried to explain, still rubbing her lover's leg.</p>
		<p>"That?" Tara chuckled though she tried not to.</p>
		<p>"It was so horrible." Willow snuggled in further.</p>
		<p>"Why don't you go off to the bathroom when Buffy gets back and I'll see what I can do." Tara promised kissing soft red hair.</p>
		<p>"I love you." Willow grinned up at her brightly.</p>
		<p>"I know you do." Tara replied happily.</p>
		<p>"I got you some of those chocolate biscuit things you like too." Buffy returned depositing the cup and plate on the table.</p>
		<p>"Ooh lovely." Tara nodded her thanks.</p>
		<p>"I'll be back in a minute." Willow smiled and slipped out of the booth. "Little girls room." She explained to the Slayer's look of confusion.</p>
		<p>"The price of mochas." Tara smiled at Buffy.</p>
		<p>"Totally, it's worse if you forget to go before a three hour lecture." She laughed.</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText2" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">"So Willow tells me that you and Nicole are doing well." Tara's voice was soft and even as she took a biscuit.</p>
		<p>"Oh yeah, I think we're doing great." Buffy grinned happily.</p>
		<p>"That's great." The blonde nodded. "No problems at all?" She pushed gently.</p>
		<p>"Willow told you didn't she?" Buffy deflated slightly.</p>
		<p>"She did, and Buffy before you panic or worry, I think that making love is a beautiful way of saying you love someone. There's nothing to be embarrassed, or worried about." She soothed munching on her biscuit.</p>
		<p>"What if there is a lack of?" Buffy questioned relaxing a bit simply because of the often nervous witch's seemingly relaxed stance.</p>
		<p>"Well if there's a lack of it, and you feel there shouldn't be, then introduce the idea of it." Tara replied softly. "Buffy making love isn't something you plan, work out and then execute. Its spontaneous, fun and above all mutual." She looked at the Slayer.</p>
		<p>"I'm going about this too slayer like aren't I?" The blonde sighed.</p>
		<p>"You are, I'm not sure whether me telling you this will help or not, but Willow and I first made love, the night Oz left." Tara explained.</p>
		<p>"You did?" Buffy tried not to look too shocked. "But... you guys had been... well I thought together for ages."</p>
		<p>"Yes, its wasn't planned, it certainly wasn't expected and we had been together a while.  But it was the right time Buffy and though we possibly could have made love earlier, it was the right time to make it then." She continued.</p>
		<p>"So right time, check." Buffy nodded. "Did the fact that Will had only been with Oz make it harder?"</p>
		<p>"No Buffy." Tara smiled more and shook her head. "Your brain might not know what to do but your body and heart will."</p>
		<p>"I just so don't want to screw this up." Buffy explained smiling back.</p>
		<p>"I know from Nicole the one thing she doesn't want to do it rush you" Tara said helpfully.</p>
		<p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">"What else did she say?" Buffy pushed lightly.</p>
		<p>"That she thinks you re the most beautiful woman she has ever seen, that you make her feel like a Goddess just by holding her hand. In fact Buffy it's quite overpowering listening to her sometimes!" She grinned.</p>
		<p>"Are you making fun of me?" Buffy asked worried before she contemplated what the blonde was saying. "Overpowering how?" She tacked on thrown by the phrasing.</p>
		<p>"No, I am not making fun, and over powering because sometimes I wonder if you're the one who has magic, because Nicole is completely in love with you." Tara casually munched on another biscuit.</p>
		<p>"In love with me?" Buffy's eyes went wide.</p>
		<p>"She hasn't told you?" For the first time Tara faltered.</p>
		<p>"No that I would remember." Buffy nodded to herself. "No mention of the ?L' word." She smiled suddenly as she thought about it, as she stared off her smile grew bigger and happier.</p>
		<p>"She's got a free till lunch." Tara watched the Slayer's face.  "I think."</p>
		<p>"She does." Buffy kept her smile as threw her knapsack strap over her head. "Say bye to Will for me." She slid out of the booth. "And Tara."  She stopped before she bolted away. "Thanks."</p>
		<p>The blonde looked up and smiled, blinking blue eyes.</p>
		<p>*******</p>
		<p>Buffy wiped her palms on her jacket and then knocked on the door.</p>
		<p>"TWO SECONDS!" Nicole's voice called to her through the wood.</p>
		<p>"No rush Nic, it's just me." Buffy called back smiling.</p>
		<p>"Oh Buffy." The door opened to reveal a rather charcoal covered Nicole, dressed only in a pair of white overalls. "Hi."</p>
		<p>"Hi." Buffy smiled and waved at her slightly. "Sorry, did I interrupt?"</p>
		<p>"No of course not, I was just working on you, that is, on your picture." Nicole wiped her hands and backed away from the door letting Buffy come in.</p>
		<p>"Cool." The Slayer made her way in dropping her bag on the chair. "For you." She dug into her coat and held out a single badly snapped rose.</p>
		<p>"Oh that's great." Nicole took the offered though damaged flower and sniffed it carefully.</p>
		<p>"I sorta wanted to go by the flower shop but Anya was working and wouldn't lend me twenty dollars unless Giles was there to ?approve' it." She laughed. "So, I hope the neighbour down the street doesn't mind."</p>
		<p>"No really Buffy this is nicer than any they'd have anyway." Nicole laughed and stopped she moved closer to the Slayer and offered her arms in a hug.  Buffy moved and hugged her tightly, breathing in the scent of the taller brunette and smiling.</p>
		<p>"I thought you were studying with Willow." Nicole didn't release her hold though she relaxed it a little.</p>
		<p>"I was but I had an attack of need to see my Canadian." Buffy smiled relaxing but not letting go either. "I'm prone to them you know."</p>
		<p>"What Canadians?" Nicole laughed.</p>
		<p>"No." Buffy laughed with her pulling back enough to see Nicole's face. "Needing to see you." She leaned in and kissed her softly.</p>
		<p>"Well any time you feel the need, just find me." Nicole purred when the kiss ended.</p>
		<p>"You too, unless I'm on patrol." Buffy added seriously. "Then only cause it's dangerous, but leave me a message at the shop and I'm right here." She kissed her again.</p>
		<p>"Mmmm so am I supposed to think these missing attacks are a bad thing?  Cause right now?" She said between kisses.  "They feel very good."</p>
		<p>"Well the missing part is bad, the seeing you bit is good." Buffy grinned and kissed her again.</p>
		<p>"Feels like ages since I've seen you." Nicole said softly. "I was working on your picture and I was just trying to picture you. Remembering the perfect tone and colour for your skin."</p>
		<p>"Me boring... you gorgeous." Buffy smiled gazing into deep brown eyes.</p>
		<p>"Buffy you forget, me artist you Slayer, I say what's beautiful, and I say you." Nicole gazed back.</p>
		<p>"No see me slayer, me see lots of ugly things, know gorgeous when I see it, and I say you." Buffy kept gazing and smiling. Suddenly every time she'd seen Tara and Will acting sappy and mushy made perfect sense.</p>
		<p>"I have pictures to prove your beauty." Nicole countered without thinking she moved her hands up and down over Buffy's back.</p>
		<p>"I have live evidence." Buffy smiled hugging her a little closer. "Did you need to get back to your picture?" She kissed the brunette slightly.</p>
		<p>"Why would I want to look at canvass when I can look at flesh?" Nicole replied and then blushed furiously. "That is I mean when I can look a you."</p>
		<p>"Sshhh." Buffy put her finger over Nicole to stop her. "You don't have to explain."</p>
		<p>"You're finger is trembling." Nicole noted as the Slayer's finger rested on her lips.</p>
		<p>"Is it?" Buffy smiled slowly. "Probably cause I love you." She whispered the words softly before she could even think to stop herself.</p>
		<p>Nicole forced herself to swallow.</p>
		<p>"You do?" She whispered back blinking.</p>
		<p>"I do." Buffy nodded. "I've been so worried about what I should do and say and when I should do it or say it, and I realized today none of that matters. Cause you make me feel happier than anyone ever, and I love you." The Slayer spilled out her mind and almost missed the answer.</p>
		<p>"I love you too Buffy, God I love you." Nicole suddenly pulled Buffy close.</p>
		<p>"You do?"</p>
		<p>"I love you, you want it in French?  I can do French?" Nicole smiled looking at Buffy's face.</p>
		<p>"I don't know French." She laughed lightly. "I could phone Giles and find out what is in ancient Sumerian?" She grinned holding the Canadian tighter.</p>
		<p>"No need." Nicole shook her head.</p>
		<p>"Good, cause I don't want to let go." Buffy smiled and kissed her again.</p>
		<p>"I can't believe how good hearing you say that makes me feel." Nicole beamed.</p>
		<p>"I don't say it very often Nic, only when I mean it." Buffy kissed her again.</p>
		<p>"I don't either." The artist agreed.</p>
		<p>"Now there was one other thing I think we need to talk about." Buffy kissed her softly for a moment.</p>
		<p>"What, anything you know that." Nicole quickly agreed.</p>
		<p>"It's not a bad thing." The Slayer rubbed her back easing away the sudden worry. "And it's not a big plan thing either, it's just a when the time is right..." She smiled her voice soft. "I want to make love to you." She used Tara's wording naturally.</p>
		<p>"Oh my?" Nicole's voice was a growl. "You have no idea no idea at all, how good that feels to hear."</p>
		<p>"How good?" Buffy raised an eyebrow.</p>
		<p>"So good." Nicole slipped her hands around to Buffy's hips.</p>
		<p>"Me too." Buffy kissed her again.</p>
		<p>"Come here." Nicole gently pulled Buffy's hips up encouraging the Slayer to lift off the floor.  Buffy eased upon her toes, kissing her girlfriend deeper.</p>
		<p>Nicole smiled in their kiss, loving the change that brought them closer to the same height. Buffy's hands moved up playing high on the brunette's back.</p>
		<p>"You know when you said abut the whole plan thing and the very agreeable time is right thing, could now be a right time, maybe?" Nicole grinned.</p>
		<p>"I think right now is a very good time." Buffy nodded softly.</p>
		<p>"Are you sure, I mean I can do candlelit dinner, soft music and moonlight, if you'd rather." Nicole's fingers massaged Buffy's hips.</p>
		<p>"Maybe later." Buffy grinned and kissed her again. "We can do all that another night."</p>
		<p>*******</p>
		<p>Buffy didn't open her eyes, as the first thing she really became aware of was the warm soft body she was curled around. The sun was just starting to set and lit the room in gentle shades of purple and red. Instantly a huge grin spread across her face as her mind caught up to the lusciously spent feeling in her body. She kissed the bare shoulder near her and hugged Nicole a bit tighter. </p>
		<p>"You can open your eyes your not dreaming." She whispered before kissing close to the Slayer's ear.</p>
		<p>"Just memorizing you with my fingertips." Buffy whispered back, running her fingers over the brunette's stomach in small circles.</p>
		<p>"Well feel free!" Nicole purred.</p>
		<p>"Unfortunately..." Buffy kept up her motions opening her eyes. "I have to patrol soon, but can I come back later?"</p>
		<p>"I could come with you." Nicole said looking into the Slayer's eyes.</p>
		<p>"Do you want too? It's dangerous." Buffy reached up to stroke brown hair behind her new lover's ear. "And I mean dangerous undead things want to kill you dangerous."</p>
		<p>"The same things that want to kill you, and I'm supposed to stay here worrying? Chris taught me some basics, and I promise to hide behind lots of trees." She gave a quirky smile.</p>
		<p>"We could get Tara and Will to come, they can show you the best trees." Buffy grinned, though she wasn't sure if she was keen on the idea but not seeing how she could let the others come and not ever let Nicole.</p>
		<p>"Actually I think Willow and Tara have something else on tonight." Nicole said softly.</p>
		<p>"What?" Buffy asked not remembering anything being mentioned.</p>
		<p>"Well Tara stopped by earlier to borrow some of my charcoal." Nicole smiled.</p>
		<p>"Oh." Buffy blushed. Now that she had an intimate knowledge, thinking of Tara and her best friend during their private time took on a whole new vivid dimension.</p>
		<p>"You know I think Tara is a little more, adventurous that she appears." Nicole chuckled.</p>
		<p>"Adventurous how?" Buffy had the question out before she thought about it.</p>
		<p>"Well as well as the charcoal she'd bought a whole roll of paper." She replied trying to answer the question without being too obvious.</p>
		<p>"Pretend I didn't just ask that." Buffy giggled shifting over a little to look down at the brunette. "So you want to come with for patrol?"</p>
		<p>"Do you mind, I could stay and cook you a nice meal or something."</p>
		<p>"No, if you want to come of course you can come." Buffy underlined. "You're a Scooby now." She grinned. "Which trust me is a better name than the slayerettes."</p>
		<p>"I believe. We should get dressed." Nicole added happy the Slayer had agreed she come go.</p>
		<p>*******</p>
		<p>Buffy pushed up off the ground as the vamp under her disappeared.</p>
		<p>"All clear." She yelled to the large tree that Nicole had ducked behind.</p>
		<p>"You know these trees are great for hiding, I swear that one has hand prints in just the right places." Nicole poked her head around the tall pine and grinned.</p>
		<p>"Xander loves that one." Buffy grinned at how easy the night had gone. Four vamps down and not even so much as a worry about Nicole's safety. In fact having the brunette around seemed to up her concentration just that little bit. "So you ready for mocha's? It's post slayage ritual."</p>
		<p>"Sounds great, and double muffins."</p>
		<p>"Only for you." Buffy held out her hand and Nicole closed her fingers around the Slayer's</p>
		<p>"Wait up a second." She urged the Slayer to stop.</p>
		<p>"What?" Buffy stopped for her.</p>
		<p>"I just wanted to say surrounded by all this, having just watched you, well, slay." Nicole pointed out. "I love you Buffy Anne Summers."</p>
		<p>"I love you too, Nicole Samantha Palmer." Buffy smiled and squeezed her hand.</p>
		<p>"Love, love, love, give us a break slayer." A low growl from behind the pair.</p>
		<p>"Spike, do you ever just get tired of pissing me off?" Buffy turned looking at him with a shake of her head.</p>
		<p>"No." He flicked on his lighter and lit his cigarette that hung lazily out of his mouth.</p>
		<p>"Well then I won't give you the satisfaction." She stepped closer to Nicole before going to lead her away. "Goodnight Spike."</p>
		<p>"Oh now come on, play with Spikey." He dashed round and cut into their path.</p>
		<p>"Go to Hell Spike." Buffy stopped with Nicole slightly behind her.</p>
		<p>"Isn't lover boy, oops girl, gonna say nothing?" He looked Nicole up and down.</p>
		<p>"Please feel free to insult him, he's a big enough idiot to deserve anything." Buffy assured her.</p>
		<p>"Can I really be bothered?" Nicole spoke only to Buffy.</p>
		<p>"Good answer." Buffy smiled and squeezed her hand. "Night Spike." They began to walk away again.</p>
		<p>"Oh that's right pretend I don't exist!" Spike ran after them.</p>
		<p>"You do exist, trust me I can not forget that." Buffy reminded him as they walked.</p>
		<p>"You know Slayer." Spike called coming to a stop before them. "You've given me two great reasons to get this chip out now. Before I only looked forward to ripping your heart out, now I can feast off her too. It's a real you know?" He growled.</p>
		<p>"One second love." Buffy stopped abruptly. She let go of Nicole's hand and in a second sprinted the few short feet to Spike grabbing him by the throat. "If you ever get that chip out..." She growled at him. "And you dare so much as even walk on the same street as her, I won't just stake you... I'll leave you in pieces and mail you all over the world. You understand William?" She tightened her grip.</p>
		<p>"Easy slayer." Spike gasped between coughs. "I was just winding you up."</p>
		<p>"I don't like jokes." Buffy held her grip tighter before she let go. "And if you go spouting your mouth off to the other demons, I'll know it was you and guess who I'll feed to the helia monster under the school?"</p>
		<p>"You seem kinda tense, not getting any?" He grinned as he dropped to his knees holding his throat.</p>
		<p>She glared at him and kicked him sideways into the grass. Turning she went back and took Nicole's hand.</p>
		<p>"Best I ever had." She whispered to the brunette kissing the back of the hand she held.</p>
		<p>"You didn't have to do that for me you know." Nicole whispered glowing with pride.</p>
		<p>"Yes, I did." Buffy nodded as they walked away. "You're my girl, undead things don't talk bad about you or I hurt them."</p>
		<p>"Your girl?" Nicole stopped again grinning.</p>
		<p>"Well yeah, I love you and we just..." Buffy grinned and blushed. "Is saying it a bad thing?"</p>
		<p>"No it's not." Nicole shook her head. "I like being your girl." She grinned wider.</p>
		<p>"Come on then, mocha's for my girl?" Buffy kissed her hand again.</p>
		<p>"Or other yummy things?" Nicole quirked her eyebrow and pointed towards home with her head.</p>
		<p>"Yummy things." Buffy grinned and started to playfully drag her along.</p>
