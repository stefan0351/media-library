<!-- To Not Go Gentle \ The Moon Has Appeared And She's Blue -->

<p>I sat on my fainting couch in my best silk dressing gown, legs crossed, champagne on the table before me, thumbing through a new issue of the American Psychiatric Association's journal.</p>

		<p>I lowered the journal to my lap and sighed. This was pathetic.</p>

		<p>Dinner was completely ready in the kitchen, from hors d'eouvres to desert -- although it was all fairly cold by now. The only thing missing was my date. Mel had called thirty minutes before with profuse apologies. She apparently had to have an emergency meeting with a woman who was getting a tummy tuck the following day. At nine o'clock at night. Yes. Just call me Gullible. Another exciting edition of Gullible's Travels. Yes. So, there I sat, sipping the champagne I had planned on sharing, nibbling on the crab puffs which sat beside the bottle, and reading a yawn-provoking article in the APA's journal.</p>

		<p>Did I mention pathetic?</p>

		<p>I glanced around my apartment, the home which is entirely too large for my needs and merely serves, most nights, to remind me that I am virtually alone.</p>

		<p>I would never leave Montana, of course. The good memories it brings to me are simply too vital to my sanity. It reminds me of my childhood, of hoping and dreaming of someday being affluent enough to live here. It reminds me that that dream has come true, even if others haven't. It reminds me of my brother and of many successful events we've thrown here. It reminds me of spending time with him.</p>

		<p>It reminds me of Daphne, as well. We started becoming closer after I moved into the Montana. She even started to drop by once in awhile, although not often, and I became a sort of confidante to her. Which is why she felt comfortable asking to stay over after that fight she had with Sherry, in all likelihood. Then, after my run-in with Schenkman, I suppose she sensed that I myself needed someone in whom to confide, because she started coming by often, two to three times a week. She'd bring a movie, and we'd sit in my upstairs lounge on the leather sofa and watch it together. Then, we'd talk for hours. She listened to me talk about Maris, and I listened to her as she told me about her childhood in Manchester, her family, her first months in America, the men she'd been with. I suppose, in the end, those visits, other than our night of dancing, were what Maris used in her case to claim that I had feelings for Daphne. She never took enough notice of me to have realized before.</p>

		<p>But Daphne rarely comes by anymore now that she's engaged, and I've almost stopped dropping by the Elliot Bay Towers altogether.</p>

		<p>Because of Donny.</p>

		<p>Good Lord. I swallowed the rest of my glass quickly and leaned back</p>

		<p>Mel was supposed to make me forget Daphne, of course. And I love Mel, in a way. She's very familiar to me. So much like Maris was.</p>

		<p>I glanced down at the coffee table at the bottle of wine. My glass was sitting on an old, tattered copy of Tennessee Williams' plays. I lifted it and thumbed through it absently. For a time, at Yale, I acted. I remember, particularly, playing Brick in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof." I was ecstatic to land such a role. It proved my merit as an actor and therefore validated the pastime, for I was nothing like Brick, the pro-football player turned alcoholic. Although then it was just a play, a means to an end, in fact, now I see the genius of Williams' play. I think there's a little bit of every character inside of me. Brick's repressed passion and anguish, Maggie's longing, desire, hurt, regret, and self-contempt. What was it that Maggie said in the play about fires? Laws of silence don't work....</p>

		<p>I murmured her speech softly to myself. "When something is festering in your memory or your imagination, laws of silence don't work, it's just like shutting a door and locking it on a house on fire in hope of forgetting that the house is burning. But not facing a fire doesn't put it out. Silence about a thing just magnifies it. It grows and festers in silence...."</p>

		<p>I suppose that's like my passion for Daphne. I tell Frasier again and again that it's gone, that I'm over her. But I don't think I'll ever be. It grows with every new thing I learn about her, every new second I spend with her.</p>

		<p>I still pondered these things, the agony of Maggie and the silent anger of Brick, book in hand, when I was startled by an abrupt knock on the door.</p>

		<p>I set the book down and stood, rubbing my temples slightly to allay the dizziness which accompanied the act, and made my way to the door. "Yes, yes," I muttered. "I'm coming."</p>

		<p>I pulled open the door to my apartment and was astonished to find Daphne in my hallway, bathed in the dim light of the blue foyer. Her cheeks were streaked with dried tears, her eyes were slightly red with a desperate gleam, her hair, which she wore quite long now, was falling over her shoulders, although a few chestnut strands clung to her face in the tracks of her tears. She looked devastatingly beautiful, like a tragic heroine awaiting her destiny. "Doctor Crane, I've got to talk to you. May I come in?"</p>

		<p>I nodded wordlessly. My mouth was undoubtedly hanging open in a ridiculously foolish expression, but it was beyond my power to move a muscle at that point. Finally, I shook myself to my senses. Oh, the state to which this woman sends me. "Daphne. Yes, of course you may come in. Please, please." I swept my hand toward the rest of the room. "Make yourself at home."</p>

		<p>She nodded and made her way to the couch, but before she sat, she caught sight of the champagne. She looked around, saw the candlelit table I had set up in preparation for Mel's arrival, and smiled, embarrassed, beginning to make her way back to the door. "Oh, good Lord. Look at me, barging in here. You're obviously in the middle of something. I'll be leaving, now."</p>

		<p>I shook my head and hurried over to her. "No, no. You see, Mel was supposed to come over tonight, but she was --" I paused. How embarrassing to tell the truth, or Mel's version of it, so clearly fabricated. "She was called away at the last minute."</p>

		<p>She watched me suspiciously as she smoothed her silky, knee-length purple paisley skirt nervously. "Are you sure?"</p>

		<p>I took a deep breath to regain my composure. I must be strong for her. She obviously needs my support. "Quite sure, Daphne. Now, please, have a seat." I smiled self-consciously and continued wryly. "And champagne, if you'd like. Or crab puffs. Or anything of the other three courses I'd prepared for tonight."</p>

		<p>She smiled thankfully and sat, and I took my own seat beside her.</p>

		<p>At a respectable distance. Close proximity to Daphne always seemed to cause me to behave irrationally. Best to keep a discreet separation.</p>

		<p>She sighed deeply. "Thank you for letting me call with no notice, Doctor Crane. I hate to intrude."</p>

		<p>I smiled and screwed up my courage. "Ahem. Well, you used to come by quite frequently, Daphne. You haven't for quite awhile. In all honestly, I find myself missing your impromptu visits." I smiled. "And your taste in movies."</p>

		<p>She smiled self-consciously and turned away, as if she knew something I didn't and was embarrassed by it, and I knew I'd said the wrong thing. I hastened to cover myself. "Um, yes, well, er -- Daphne, you obviously have something important on your mind. Please, go ahead."</p>

		<p>When she looked back, her eyes shone with tears. She looked at me desperately, pleadingly. And for a moment, I hoped --</p>

		<p>"Doctor Crane, I think I might be pregnant."</p>

		<p>Oh, my God. I did not hope for that. Never that. Hyperventilating. Oh, Lord. Breathe, Niles. Breathe. "Daphne --" Still couldn't breath.</p>

		<p>Her maternal instincts kicked into gear immediately. She turned toward me and began rubbing my back rhythmically. "It's all right. Deep breaths. Breathe. In. Out. In. Out. That's it. You're all right." I slowly regained my breath.</p>

		<p>She'll make an extraordinary mother.</p>

		<p>Now how on earth to explain my reaction?</p>

		<p>"Well," I laughed slightly, crying inside. "This is big news, isn't it?"</p>

		<p>She moved away again and sighed. "I had planned on seeing Roz about it, in all honestly. I suppose this isn't something I'd normally confide first to a male friend, no matter how close. But it seems that Bulldog is back. His car was at Roz's apartment... I could almost feel it glaring at me, like, 'Go away! Go away! That mean man who drives me is upstairs with your friend and he'll treat me very badly on the ride home if he has to leave now!' So I left." I smiled. With all my heart I love her quirks and eccentricities, the crazy little things she says. Her psychic premonitions. The time she told us if Eddie were a Beatle he'd be George. I don't know why!</p>

		<p>She looked up imploringly. "I know it must seem very unusual for me to come to you with this, but I had to have someone to talk to."</p>

		<p>I nodded. "Quite all right. You can always come to me, Daphne. Always." I paused, then began again hesitantly. "So, is this... good news? I suppose I should be congratulating you."</p>

		<p>She looked up desperately. "No. Oh, God, no. It's not good news at all."</p>

		<p>Oh. Okay. Calm down. My heart was beating wildly. What did this mean? "Are you certain?" Oops. I should probably make that clearer. "I mean, do you know for sure whether or not you really are... er --?"</p>

		<p>She shook her head. "No. It's just a feeling, really." She smiled. "I suppose it must seem strange to you, me coming here when I don't really know one way or the other. I suppose men are more concerned with facts and proof than women. I had a feeling, and I just needed someone to listen to me. It always makes me feel better."</p>

		<p>I looked down at her clasped hands and put one of mine over them. "Well, Daphne. You know I'll always be here for you." I raised my chin, eyes still lowered, the way I have when I'm either embarrassed or ashamed of what I'm about to say. "This isn't good news, you say?"</p>

		<p>She leaned back against the headrest of the fainting couch, like she did on that singular, heated night, her face scrunched slightly in a way that made her look like a pouty little girl. "I'm just so confused."</p>

		<p>I sighed. She's worried about being a pregnant bride. There's no sense in hoping for more than that. "Daphne, for what it's worth, many women approach their wedding days already with child. Besides, the wedding is only three weeks away. If it's so important to you, you could lie slightly about the due date. You've nothing to worry about, I assure you. You'll be fine."</p>

		<p>She shook her head and sat up, leaning toward me as if expounding the greatest secret of her life. "But you see, Doctor Crane, that's not why I'm worried."</p>

		<p>I watched her, confused and nervous, as she stood and began pacing the area in front of my couch. No. I will not let myself be too personally taken with this. I am a psychiatrist. I can act as a psychiatrist. "Ahem. Well, why don't we start by your telling me why it is you suspect that you're pregnant, and then we can discuss why it not a positive realization for you."</p>

		<p>She spun toward me, her eyes afire. Good God, I love it when she's angry with me. Oh, mama!</p>

		<p>No, I am a psychiatrist. Cool reserve.</p>

		<p>She glared daggers at me. "Don't you dare do that, Doctor Crane."</p>

		<p>I watched from my position on the couch as she paced wildly. I was breathing heavily, but I tried not to let it show. "Do what, Daphne?"</p>

		<p>She waved at me. "That! That! You're my friend, not my psychiatrist. Don't you dare treat me like another one of your patients. I came here to confide in my best friend, not a doctor."</p>

		<p>Best friend, did she say? My heart leapt at the thought. Daphne trusts me that much.</p>

		<p>I sighed, then. I couldn't argue. To treat Daphne as a patient is an insult not only to our friendship, but also to my feelings for her. "I'm sorry, Daphne. I just don't know what you want me to say, I suppose."</p>

		<p>She took a deep breath, calming down, and shook her head. "No, I'm the one who should be sorry. I barge into your house, force this all on you, despite your obvious discomfort, and then act ungrateful when you try to help." She paused, and I watched her, fascinated. She's exquisite when she's passionate. A comment that could quickly lead to unsavory (or quite savory) thoughts. We're helping Daphne. Helping Daphne. "It started last week." She sighed and came back over to sit beside me. "I began having strange visions. A bit like the ones I was having before the engagement." She looked embarrassed. "I know you don't put much credit in them, though, Doctor Crane. But they made me realize something was wrong. Then, I started to have nightmares. I don't remember any of them, but I woke up for several nights in a row, covered with sweat from head to toe, thrashing about under my sheets wildly, like some animal --"</p>

		<p>Oh, good Lord! How can I handle this? The image those words invoke! I dug my fingers into the couch cushion, head lowered to hide my blush, but she wasn't looking toward me to notice.</p>

		<p>"And then, after all these frightening signs, Aunt Scarlet is several days late for her monthly visit, if you know what I mean." This time, my blush must've been a deep crimson, and, just my luck, she glanced over at that moment. And smiled. "Oh, don't you see, Doctor Crane? This is why I tried Roz before you. You men, all so modest."</p>

		<p>I cleared my throat. "No, quite all right, Daphne, quite all right." I paused. "Why don't you tell me more about those... those visions?"</p>

		<p>She nodded. "The first was the same one as before. A man in a wedding tuxedo. But I couldn't see his face."</p>

		<p>"All right. Any others?"</p>

		<p>"Two more. They were unlike any visions I've ever had. Usually, well, I just see scenes. In these, I was... a sort of active participant."</p>

		<p>"And what were you doing?"</p>

		<p>She looked up slightly mournfully. "Well, in the first, I was holding a baby. A very happy baby. He was smiling up at me in that adorable way babies have."</p>

		<p>I nodded. "Anything unusual about the child? What did it look like?" The psychiatrist in me was still full-force. I was taking mental notes about these images and trying to determine meanings in my mind. And trying to remain as detached as possible.</p>

		<p>She closed her eyes, pondering the question. I gazed at her, dazed. She opened her eyes, and I quickly looked at the ceiling.</p>

		<p>Ooh, good save, Niles.</p>

		<p>"It was a boy. He didn't have any hair yet, but he had bright blue eyes."</p>

		<p>I nodded. Most babies do, at any rate. "Anything else in that one?"</p>

		<p>She nodded solemnly. "A man standing beside me."</p>

		<p>"Donny?" I cringed to consider him.</p>

		<p>"I don't know. I couldn't see him. I suppose it must've been Donny, though."</p>

		<p>I nodded. Well, damn. These didn't sound terrible at all. They sounded wonderful. I didn't even know if I could stand to hear the last. I had to, though. "And the last... vision?"</p>

		<p>She nodded. "I was on the beach. Not one of those crowded, commercial beaches, a very rocky, abandoned beach. I could smell the sea. It smelled salty. There was a little boy. He had his back turned to me. He was crouched over by the water, watching it come up and lap over his feet. I called his name and reached out to him and he started to turn around toward me."</p>

		<p>I winced. That didn't sound so foreboding, either. "And this is not all a sign that you want children?"</p>

		<p>She wrung her hands together again and looked down at her lap, clearly upset. "Well, you see, the way I see it, all these visions connect together into a sort of storyline. A man, a baby, a little boy. But it obviously wasn't MY little boy. He had bright blonde hair."</p>

		<p>All righty. Well. I hoped my voice didn't waver when I spoke again. "Did you notice anything else about him?"</p>

		<p>She shook her head. "His back was to me."</p>

		<p>"I thought you said you called his name? And he turned around?"</p>

		<p>"No. I know that I did call it, but I don't know what it was. I just had a feeling that I had said it. And he had only just begun to turn when the vision ended."</p>

		<p>I sighed. "But you say you're not sure about the pregnancy? Haven't taken one of those home tests or anything?"</p>

		<p>She looked down at her purse nervously. "No. I've been carrying one around with me for several days, but I haven't had the nerve. And I don't know what I'd do, to find out by myself and be alone with a load like that. I needed to talk to someone first."</p>

		<p>I looked at my hands nervously. "Well, Daphne, you could always -- What I mean to say is that you could --" I took a deep breath. "If you'd like to have someone with you while you're taking --" Oh, God. "Err... waiting for the results, I'd be happy to -- That is, you could do it here...." By this time I was fidgeting nervously, my head turned completely away from her.</p>

		<p>I didn't expect her to embrace me. "Oh, Doctor Crane, would you really do that for me? It would be so wonderful to have someone here for me."</p>

		<p>I turned back toward her, trying to hold onto my confident facade and protect my soft, nerve-wracked underbelly from her view. "Of course I would, Daphne. Do you want to do it now?" She nodded hesitantly. "You know where the bathroom is, of course." We stood together as I ushered her toward the stairs.</p>

		<p>She nodded as we walked and then looked over at me at me timidly. "I'm scared."</p>

		<p>Daphne, scared? This was big. I've never seen her scared before. Of course, there was the time she came to my office, after her initial visions, but that was nothing compared to this. I wondered which prospect truly scared her more. Or if it was just the uncertainty. "I'm here for you. Go ahead upstairs now."</p>

		<p>She nodded and left.</p>

		<p>I don't know what had held me together before. Perhaps the knowledge that she needed me.</p>

		<p>Now, I fell apart.</p>

		<p>I grabbed the edge of my couch for support and lowered myself back onto it. I felt my breath begin to catch again. I glanced at my hands. I was shaking like a leaf.</p>

		<p>Daphne, pregnant?</p>

		<p>The thought terrified me.</p>

		<p>Because I've always been able to pretend, and I supposed I'd have gone on pretending until the end, that there was a chance for us. That she would realize that I'm here for her and devoted to her and always will be, forever and ever till death do us part. And that she would reciprocate my feelings.</p>

		<p>No more.</p>

		<p>There had always been something possessive about Donny that made me cringe. I found it almost offensive. Of course, maybe I merely interpreted the displays of affection of a man in love as possessive because I myself stood so far from possessing her myself.</p>

		<p>But I would never want to possess Daphne. I don't think that Daphne could ever be possessed. She's a free spirit, utterly her own.</p>

		<p>Perhaps this is why Donny's possessive, showy nature offends me. Not for my own sake, but for hers. Because Daphne should never be other than her own.</p>

		<p>But... pregnant by Donny -- that changed that. It joined them forever. It made at least a part of Daphne Donny's.</p>

		<p>The woman who belonged to no one, suddenly chained.</p>

		<p>I heard a noise behind me, and I turned around. She was standing at the top of the stairs looking at me over the railing. She looked sad.</p>

		<p>I held my hand out to her, and she walked over to me, taking my outstretched hand in hers as she sat down beside me. I put my arm around her, surprised at my courage, and held her to me, her head nestled in the crook of my neck.</p>

		<p>But I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised at myself. After all, there was no risk, now. Daphne no longer could be mine. Her visions were an eccentricity, yes, but, finally, even I, a doctor, am forced to note that they always seem to contain a grain of truth. She has an incredible intuition, at the very least. She must be pregnant.</p>

		<p>I bent my head forward and whispered into her hair. "So now we wait?" She nodded against me. She shook slightly. She was crying. I tightened my grip around her shoulders. "Don't worry. You'll be fine. You're strong."</p>

		<p>"You're right. I'll be okay."</p>

		<p>We sat like that for a few moments, her breath heavy against me. Another time, another place, and this would be heaven. "Daphne?"</p>

		<p>"Mmmhhph." Her muffled answer.</p>

		<p>"Why are you so scared? Why is this not a good thing?"</p>

		<p>She sat up slightly and looked at me, confused. "I'm not quite sure, to be honest. It's just a feeling I have, deep inside. Dread."</p>

		<p>I rubbed her shoulder. "But you want children. You've always said so."</p>

		<p>She nodded. "Yes, I do. I want children more than anything. But not --" Suddenly, her hand flew to her mouth as if she had been about to utter something terrible.</p>

		<p>I watched her carefully. "But not what, Daphne? What were you going to say?"</p>

		<p>She shook her head and smiled slightly. "No, it was silly. Ridiculous, in fact. I can't imagine what made such a horrid thought come to my head."</p>

		<p>"What was it, Daphne? You can tell me."</p>

		<p>She watched me closely, as if judging me, and then smiled self-consciously. "Well, I almost said 'But not Donny's.' Can you imagine?"</p>

		<p>Good Lord.</p>

		<p>My God.</p>

		<p>I tried to smile, as if I thought it were ridiculous, too.</p>

		<p>Suddenly, my bedroom alarm clock went off with a loud series of BEEPs. I looked at her questioningly. "I set it to go off in fifteen minutes. I can check, now."</p>

		<p>She didn't move, though. Not a muscle. "Would you like me to come?" She nodded, then, and I stood up, pulling her after me. She kept ahold of my hand as she led me up the stairs toward my bedroom.</p>

		<p>Another time, another place....</p>

		<p>She first shut off the alarm clock, which had been blaring incessantly. Then, she led me to the bathroom.</p>

		<p>My bathroom. Oh, God, to hear such crushing news somewhere so intimate. I might have to switch rooms after this.</p>

		<p>The test was lying on the sideboard beside the sink. She seemed afraid to go near it, so I came up behind her and laid my hands on her shoulders in what I hoped would be interpreted as a gesture of comfort.</p>

		<p>Remind me again where I garnered such courage? Ah, yes. I'm being strong for Daphne.</p>

		<p>I watched over her shoulder. Slowly, very slowly, she lifted the test. I didn't look at the result. I didn't feel it was my place to know before she did. I watched her face, instead. Her eyes were closed as she took a deep breath. Then, she opened her eyes, blinked twice, and sucked in a breath sharply. And smiled. I looked at the piece of plastic in front of her.</p>

		<p>Negative.</p>

		<p>Oh, my God.</p>

		<p>Negative.</p>

		<p>Impossible. I was so sure she was right.</p>

		<p>Negative.</p>

		<p>Oh, thank God.</p>

		<p>She spun around and threw her arms around my shoulders, burying her face into the crook of my neck. Well, "clung to me for dear life" might have been a more applicable description, as I found it slightly hard to breathe with the vice-grip she had on my neck. At first, I didn't know what to do, but as reality hit me, I found I could breathe again, and I wrapped my arms around her waist and held her. I smiled. "You're all right."</p>

		<p>It was a surreal feeling, altogether. I was embracing Daphne in my bathroom, in my dressing gown, my back pressed hard against the sink. Just enough fantasy to be exquisite, just enough reality to be... well, real.</p>

		<p>She pulled back and smiled at me. "Oh, dear goodness. I don't know how to thank you, Doctor Crane. You're such a wonderful friend."</p>

		<p>I smiled. "No thanks needed, Daphne. I'm happy I could be here for you."</p>

		<p>She nodded and glanced at her watch. It must've been after ten by that time. "Oh, I should get going. I told your brother and your father I'd be at Roz's."</p>

		<p>Quickly, I sought for reasons for her to stay.</p>

		<p>Watch a movie?</p>

		<p>I don't own any movies besides documentaries and instructional cooking videos. She brings the movies.</p>

		<p>Dinner?</p>

		<p>Cold as a brick now.</p>

		<p>Desert?</p>

		<p>Probably not much better, but a possibility.</p>

		<p>Read?</p>

		<p>I should think not. Crash course in the dull reality of my life.</p>

		<p>Write?</p>

		<p>What's next, arithmetic?</p>

		<p>Talk?</p>

		<p>We've done quite enough of that to emotionally exhaust me for the night.</p>

		<p>Darn socks?</p>

		<p>Straws, pulling at straws.</p>

		<p>"Daphne, I made Creme Brulee for Mel. Of course, she didn't show up. Would you care to stay for desert?"</p>

		<p>In the end, she did. We didn't say much, though. She told me it was delicious.</p>

		<p>It was pretty good, actually. And, with Daphne's help, I'd gotten the proportions in the caramel topping just right. Cooking with Daphne is a glorious experience. I try to find as many excuses to get us together in the kitchen as I can. Of course, the last time, we cooked dinner for Mel....</p>

		<p>She left quickly after that. I'm sure she was even more drained than I. I bid her good night at ten fifty.</p>

		<p>Knowing absolutely that despite my exhaustion I'd never get to sleep.</p>

		<p>I sat on my fainting couch, picked up the current edition of the American Psychiatric Association's journal, and began to read.</p>
