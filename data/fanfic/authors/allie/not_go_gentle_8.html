<!-- To Not Go Gentle \ Daphne The Cat -->

<p>I sat on my bed, my hands folded behind my head, thinking about my night and day.</p>

		<p>I'd had dinner with Donny. He tried to "reassure" me that we'd have more chances to have children.</p>

		<p>Which only depressed me further, because I know Doctor Crane was right in what he told me in the park.</p>

		<p>At least, part of it. Yes, I'm afraid of making a commitment like this. But that does not mean that I'm not ready. It's like jumping in the deep end of a pool for the first time. You just do it. You might be scared, but you jump all the way in, and for a little while it's terrible and suffocating and you think you're going to die, but you eventually come to the top again.</p>

		<p>Unless you're like little brother Michael, of course, and then you're hurled in by brother Nigel without your consent and have to be hauled out by the paramedics.</p>

		<p>But after you come to the surface, you're able to tread water. You're fine.</p>

		<p>Of course, is that what I want to be? "Treading water," "fine"?</p>

		<p>I'd never leave him, of course. Not without a damn good reason. I make it a habit not to leave men. I stick it out, wait to be left. The only time I ever left anything in my life was when I came to America.</p>

		<p>But that was because of Billy. Billy told me to come. That I didn't want to end up like Mum, that I needed to get away while I could.</p>

		<p>So I did.</p>

		<p>Billy gave me the reason, the push I needed.</p>

		<p>Which Doctor Crane, in his current state, is certainly not able to do.</p>

		<p>My God, how could he bloody do this to me?</p>

		<p>I don't think I love Donny.</p>

		<p>Nice segue, Daphne. But I've said it.</p>

		<p>A few strains from one of my favorite plays came to me, then, and I closed my eyes, remembering the production Billy took me to in London that day. The only theatre production in London I ever went to. That was the day he told me I had to leave.</p>

		<p>I spoke them softly to myself as I hugged my knees to my chest, my eyes squeezed closed. "What is the victory of a cat on a hot tin roof? -- I wish I knew.... Just staying on it, I guess, as long as she can." I balled up my fists, speaking louder now. "I feel all the time like a cat on a hot tin roof!" What was Brick's response? Then jump off the roof, jump off it, cats can jump off roofs and land on their four feet uninjured! I shook my head. "Well, I'm taking no chances. No, I'd rather stay on this hot tin roof."</p>

		<p>A hot tin roof's 'n uncomfo'table place t' stay on.....</p>

		<p>Yes. What else did Maggie say? Life must be allowed to continue even after the dream of life's gone. Isn't that right? Something along those lines.</p>

		<p>Yes, I'd rather stay on this hot tin roof.</p>

		<p>I could feel the tears springing up, but I wouldn't let them.</p>

		<p>In three weeks, I will be Missus Donald Ronald Douglas.</p>

		<p>What's so bad about that?</p>

		<p>I'm emotional. I'm having mood swings because I'm nervous. Yelling at Roz and Doctor Crane last night proves that. And everyone's nervous so close to their wedding.</p>

		<p>I heard my door creak a bit. I opened my eyes and looked at it. Eddie was poking his head in.</p>

		<p>"Oh, come here, you little mongrel." He ran over and jumped onto my bed beside me. I held him to me. It made me feel good to have him so near. "What on earth are we going to do when you're not around anymore, my little bloke?"</p>

		<p>Then I stopped. What would it matter to me, really? I won't live here anymore. I tell the Cranes I'll be around almost as often as I am now, but I know that's not true. It'll start by me missing the little things. The little fights between Doctor Crane and his father. Come to think of it, I probably won't see Doctor Crane very much at all, anymore. He'll be gone to work around the time I'm working with his father.</p>

		<p>Oh, Mister Crane will probably tell me stories. Some little competitive war that went on between Doctor Crane and his brother. Some little event they dragged him to. He'll complain to me that Doctor Crane didn't let him watch the game because he and Roz wanted to watch that dumb tv show she's gotten him hooked to. He'll tell me about the current state of Doctor Crane's war with the bloke upstairs.</p>

		<p>But I won't be here to see it all myself, anymore. I won't be here to keep Doctor Crane in order, to loan Roz clothes, or to go out to eat with the Cranes when they need a fourth person. I won't be here when Doctor Crane drops by....</p>

		<p>He's probably the person I'll see the least, in fact.</p>

		<p>I'll always see Roz. We're close enough that we won't lose touch. We go out quite frequently for little girls' nights out, and I'm sure we will long after I'm married.</p>

		<p>I'll of course see Mister Crane once a day, probably twice, if he'll ever actually do his exercises.</p>

		<p>Doctor Crane.... I'll see him often, too. He only works three hours a day, after all. I'll probably see him several times a week. Saturdays. But let's face it, we're not exactly social. The only reason he's asked me to family functions before is because, well, I was part of the family. I won't be anymore. I'll be part of Donny's family.</p>

		<p>And what about the other Doctor Crane? When I do see him, it's because he's dropped by his brother's apartment. There was that period of time after his divorce when I dropped by his apartment quite often. But I suppose as a married woman, night visits with another man are a wee bit extreme. Donny's not really the jealous type, but he has been known to flair up. So when would I ever have occasion to even see him?</p>

		<p>Of course, thinking about him reminds me of what he did to me.</p>

		<p>How dare he? How could he? I trusted him.</p>

		<p>"Oh, Eddie, you're one Crane who I'll never have to worry about," I told him, rubbing his ears a bit. Then, I noticed the piece of paper under his collar. I looked at it. "I'm sorry" with a frowny face under it. That's it? All of a sudden, there was a knock on my door. Oh, goodness. I should've known. "Whaddayou want, Doctor Crane?"</p>

		<p>He opened the door slightly and peeked in. "Did you get my note, Daphne?"</p>

		<p>I rolled my eyes. "I might've. What's it for?"</p>

		<p>He walked in, shuffling his feet slightly, his hands buried in his pockets. His classic pose when he's embarrassed about something. "Well, Daphne, I wanted to apologize about my part in your little mix-up."</p>

		<p>I rolled my eyes. "Well, it's hardly your fault. I only told one soul, and as far as I'm concerned, it's his bloody fault."</p>

		<p>He shook his head, holding his hands out, and came to sit on the end of my bed. "Daphne, no. He didn't mean anything by it. He just came to me for advice."</p>

		<p>I was becoming angry just thinking about him. I sat up indignantly. "Well, that's his bloody problem, isn't it? When he grows up enough to stop being so bleedin' dependent on everyone else's opinions, you tell him to give me a ring."</p>

		<p>He studied at me carefully. "Daphne, this is about more than Donny finding out, isn't it?" I looked down but didn't say anything. I think my tone of voice might have given a wee bit too much away. "Daphne, the reason he spoke to me is that he cares for you and your happiness. He had a particular opinion about the subconscious motivations behind your concerns, but he wanted to check himself before launching into advice that could very well change your life. He had to make sure he was doing what was best for you."</p>

		<p>I wanted to laugh. I wanted to cry. I wanted to scream. "If he doesn't know what's best for me by now, I suppose he never will. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a shower."</p>

		<p>He sighed and stood. "Daphne, regardless of what you think of him or me right now, I'd like for you to think about his advice. For what it matters, I think he's right."</p>

		<p>I went into my bathroom, leaving him standing by my bed.</p>
