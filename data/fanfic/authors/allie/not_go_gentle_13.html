<!-- To Not Go Gentle \ A "Tragically Elegant" Figure Discovers The Truth -->

<p>"Hello?"</p>

		<p>His voice was a little bit scratchy. "Niles? Where are you?"</p>

		<p>He sighed. "Roz? Is that you? Why are you calling me now?"</p>

		<p>I rolled my eyes as I paced my apartment's single room. "I have important news for you. What're you doing?"</p>

		<p>"Having the worst date of my life."</p>

		<p>I sat down on my bed and grimaced in sympathy. It's weird, Niles and I have grown to be pretty good friends over the past seven years. Believe me, I never saw it coming. I mean, he didn't even remember who I was the first twenty times I met him. I remember what he said the second time I saw him: "Oh, well, I'm far too successful to feel embarrassed about this. Who are you again?" I knew right then and there that we could never, ever be friends.</p>

		<p>But we are. Isn't that strange? He feels pretty open telling me his problems, and I can tell him most of mine, even if he does roll his eyes like I'm crazy when I tell him about my men. I mean, our relationship is nothing like the one Frasier and I have, but, well, we sorta have a truce.</p>

		<p>That doesn't mean I can't insult him every now and then, though. He needs it. It's good for him.</p>

		<p>Not tonight, though. He sounds about dead, and I have important new for him. Tonight, it's time to be civil.</p>

		<p>"Yea, Niles, you don't sound too good. What happened?"</p>

		<p>He paused, as if he was trying to consider whether he could trust me or something. "Well, it's Mel. She's just being ruthless."</p>

		<p>"Well, Niles, I gotta tell you, I only saw Maris a few times, but Mel has always reminded me of your descriptions of her."</p>

		<p>He sighed. "Yes, I'm beginning to see that."</p>

		<p>I wrinkled my nose as I leaned back in my bed. Thank God. "What'd she do this time, Niles?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, she's just said terrible things about Daphne. It took everything I had to restrain myself."</p>

		<p>Ouch.</p>

		<p>The Crane boys each have very interesting relationships with our dear Daphne. I learned that in the very beginning. I don't really know what it is about her, or maybe about them, but she managed to endear herself immediately to the three of them to the point that she became every bit as much a Crane as she was a Moon. They all have these weird, special bonds with her.</p>

		<p>Let's take Frasier as an example. Yes, he laughs about her weirdness as much as he's amazed (Prince Charles! Who knew?), but deep down, he's damn protective of her. To him, nothing is good enough for Daphne. Maybe not even his own brother. I remember once, way back in those first couple years, when Daphne'd hit a dry spell in her dating. Frasier made it his goal to find the perfect man for her. No one was good enough. And when he finally found someone, well, he turned out to be... well... let's just say not quite right.</p>

		<p>I've really never known what to think about Frasier's attitude toward her. I mean, on one hand, I'm still sort of offended. Why was Sven good enough for me but not for her? But I don't think he really means it as an insult. He just views us differently. I am (dare I say?) his equal? His confidante? His best friend? He trusts me to make my own judgments, and he respects me enough to know that I can handle whatever comes my way. I mean, I know he'll be there for me no matter what, but he trusts me enough to give me distance. Daphne's different. She's sort of like his baby sister. He makes fun of her mercilessly, but he adores her and would strangle any man who hurt her, like any good big brother would. I think that's why it bothered him so much back when Joe started spending the night. It wasn't just that sex was happening in his study. It was that Daphne was having sex in his study, and no big brother ever wants to let his little sister grow up that much. Especially not one as protective as Frasier.</p>

		<p>Martin sees her in sort of the same way, I think. She's like his daughter. He treats her almost just like he treats Niles and Frasier, complete with complaints and orneriness. Only difference is that Daphne doesn't get mad like Frasier does, and she can't leave like Niles can. So she ends up just laughing at him. He is funny, the old bear.</p>

		<p>From what I gather, though, Daphne never had a really healthy relationship with her dad. She doesn't say a lot about him, but it's never sounded like they were close. I think the relationship she has with Marty is the one she sort of wishes she had with her own dad.</p>

		<p>Oh, God. I think I haven't been getting enough sleep in my booth. I'm actually picking up some of Frasier's ideas.</p>

		<p>But seriously, she absolutely adores him, but she still feels comfortable enough with him to put him in his place when he needs to be brought down. He's the father figure in her life now, and she's like his daughter. Only unlike Frasier, he's let Daphne grow up.</p>

		<p>And Niles. Niles is different entirely. He worships the ground she walks on. His attitude about her... it's sorta like he's some kind of ancient knight, and it's his duty to protect her honor or something. Which is why he's so pissed at Mel, I guess.</p>

		<p>Of course, it wasn't always like that. He used to just be a horny little dog who'd give anything to get her into his room for just one night. It was sort of insulting to poor Daph. I blame it on Maris and her mind games.</p>

		<p>But now, he treats her with this... what's the word... reverence or something, like she's holy. Damn, what I wouldn't give for some guy to treat me the way he treats her. I think it's been ever since he realized once and for all that he really does love her, that it's not just a lustful attraction he's feeling. And I think he's only know that (or been able to face that) for the past few years.</p>

		<p>Why? Well, he tried so long to believe he really loved that psychotic Maris. I think that if he'd admitted to himself how he really felt about Daphne, it would have ruined that illusion. So he kept it sort of crude and crass, below the belt, in some weird effort to hide what he really felt.</p>

		<p>Oh, man, I sound like Frasier again. I've really gotta stop listening to him.</p>

		<p>But damn, now that Niles's realized once and for all how he really feels (which I think came right after the thing with that freak Schenkman)... damn. I've never seen a man so in love. I'm surprised she only just figured it out.</p>

		<p>Anyway, back to our little conversation.</p>

		<p>He'd just said to me, "Mel said some positively vile things about Daphne. It took my greatest effort to retain my composure." Or something snooty-sounding like that. We'll just pretend that's right.</p>

		<p>"Why would she do that? I mean, I know she's never thought too highly of Daph, being the little witch she is -- no offense or anything, Niles -- but what would make her say something now?"</p>

		<p>He heaved this deep, mournful kind of sigh. "Well, you see, Daphne and I had an -- interrupted conversation in the park today. Apparently one of Mel's friends saw us."</p>

		<p>Ooh. This was getting juicy. I rubbed my hands together excitedly. "Ooh! And she thought you were having an affair? Man, Niles! Well?"</p>

		<p>He huffed. "Well, what?"</p>

		<p>I rolled my eyes. "Well, ARE you?"</p>

		<p>"No, ROZ, I am not having an affair with her. I think you owe Daphne quite a bit more credit. She does have DIGNITY, Roz, unlike some people. She is first and foremost a lady." Oh, Lord. What did I tell you? He's got it bad.</p>

		<p>"So you told her you weren't having an affair?"</p>

		<p>"Actually, that's not why she was angry. She simply thought it was beneath her for her significant other to be seen in public with his brother's maid."</p>

		<p>I stood up, shocked. "She SAID that?"</p>

		<p>It's a wonder he didn't deck her.</p>

		<p>Oh, God, that last thought is making me laugh. Niles, throw a punch? Yea, right.</p>

		<p>But at least now I understand why he's totally ditched her to have this... well, pretty damn long conversation with me.</p>

		<p>His voice was really rough. "Well, it's close enough to what she said. I'm appalled. That she would have the nerve --"</p>

		<p>I had walked over to my couch, phone pressed against my ear. Now I sat down on the arm of it. Or not. These shorts ride up pretty bad when I try that.... That's what I get for mucking around the house in running shorts and a sweatshirt. But who's looking, right? As long as I close my blinds, at least. I only open then when I was to put on a show for that cute guy across the way. So what if he's married? His wife doesn't like it, she can shove it.</p>

		<p>"Niles, you've gotta take this in context. I mean, she'd have no way of knowing you'd be so offended by something like that."</p>

		<p>He was really quiet for a little bit. "What do you mean?"</p>

		<p>I rolled my eyes. "Well, she'd have no way of knowing how much you care about Daphne."</p>

		<p>Another pause. "Isn't it obvious? That she's my best friend?"</p>

		<p>I sighed. Men are so dense. "That you think she's hot? Yes. That you're totally in lust? Yes. That you fall over your feet for her like a dog in heat? Yes. That you really, really care for her, deep down? That she's one of your closest friends? That there's no one on earth more important to you? Sure, you may act that way when it's just the two of you, Niles. I don't really know how you act when it's just the two of you. But when you're around a lot of people? When you're concerned about making an impression? No, it's not obvious. Especially recently. Around Mel, you sorta treat her like the help."</p>

		<p>A very LOOOONG pause. "Oh my God."</p>

		<p>I smirked. "Sorry to tell you that."</p>

		<p>"Oh, dear. Oh, good Lord. What do I do?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, God, Niles, I don't know. Ask someone else." I glanced at my watch. "Won't your little dinner companion be missing you? You're supposed to be a gentleman or whatever."</p>

		<p>"Oh, yes, yes, I suppose I should go."</p>

		<p>"Yea."</p>

		<p>"Er -- Was there any especial reason you called, Roz, or was it just to tear me away from my filet mignon?"</p>

		<p>Oh, yea. Oops. Almost forgot about that.</p>

		<p>"Oh, yea. Damn. Donny called a few minutes ago. Needed someone to talk to. Apparently Daphne's called off the wedding or something."</p>

		<p>The line went dead.</p>

		<p>He hung up on me!</p>

		<p>Can you imagine that?</p>

		<p>Little twerp. That's the last time I do HIM a favor.</p>
