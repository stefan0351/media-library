<!-- To Not Go Gentle \ The Lion Cub Finally Learns How To Growl or The Night That Niles Grew Up -->

<p>I made my way slowly back to my table.</p>

		<p>Mel was finishing her salad. As I approached, she glared at me. "I hope you have a good reason for humiliating me like this! Abandoning me for..." She glanced at the gold Cartier watch I'd given her. "... twenty minutes? In the middle of a popular restaurant! I'll have you know that I actually saw PITY in the eyes of several of the patrons! Do you know how embarrassing this is?" She folded her arms in front of her and looked away from me, toward the potted plant in the corner of the room.</p>

		<p>If she expected me to grovel, to bend to her will....</p>

		<p>Well, that was the old Niles.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry, Mel. I've got to go. I think... hope someone needs me right now."</p>

		<p>She turned toward me, her eyes wide with shock. "If you leave this restaurant without giving me a better explanation than that...." She shook her head. Her glare was lethal. "Then, Niles, we're over."</p>

		<p>And for the first time in my life, there was no question in my mind.</p>

		<p>I'll admit right now, in the confidentiality of these pages, that I'm not a very strong man.</p>

		<p>I'm a weak man who often finds himself dominated by the woman in his life, as my father will be the first to point out.</p>

		<p>I cowered before Maris. And I crawled back to her every time she asked me to.</p>

		<p>And when, at last, I finally didn't go back to her.... I still doubted. I was still tempted to. Frasier helped me through those times. He convinced me that freedom from Maris... freedom from Maris was worth even the Shangri-La.</p>

		<p>Although Mel is different in the respect that she really does love me, she has been similar to Maris in her control over me, although her ploys have been a far cry from Maris' elaborate machinations and manipulations. But I've been trained to cower, and cower I did. When Mel had a problem, and changing myself in some small way would solve it, I did so. I have compromised myself, once again, for a woman.</p>

		<p>But I will not now.</p>

		<p>"All right," I responded, nodding. "Then I suppose we're over."</p>

		<p>I reached into my wallet, pulled out a hundred dollar bill to cover the meal and tip, and walked out. Her shocked expression followed me out.</p>

		<p>When I arrived at Frasier's apartment, I hesitated at the door.</p>

		<p>Do I dare disturb the universe?</p>

		<p>In a minute there is time for decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.</p>

		<p>Oh, good Lord. Quoting T.S. Eliot now? What's next?</p>

		<p>And J. Alfred Prufrock? That is not me. Not anymore. Never again. It was the old Niles who wouldn't have been brave enough to do this.</p>

		<p>I knocked on the door, fully expecting Daphne to answer it. I took a deep breath.</p>

		<p>I heard a voice. Frasier's. He opened the door. "Oh, hello, Niles. I thought you were out with Mel."</p>

		<p>"Don't play dumb, Frasier. I'm sure you just got off the phone with Roz." I walked around toward the balcony to hang my trenchcoat up. I glanced out at the moon. It was full.</p>

		<p>My brother wrinkled his brow. "Oh, all right. Well, I'm assuming that since you're home already, something happened between you." He grinned. "Or nothing happened between you."</p>

		<p>I nodded absently, not having the energy to rebut his vapid insinuations and jabs.</p>

		<p>Dad shook his head from his chair as he scratched Eddie's ears. "Fras, shut up and give your brother a little space. He obviously has something on his mind."</p>

		<p>I nodded again. "Frasier, where's Daphne?"</p>

		<p>His face clouded. "No, Niles. She needs space. I don't think it would be a good idea for you to see her right now."</p>

		<p>I shook my head violently and swallowed. "No, Frasier, I will not let you do this." I took my suit jacket off and threw it on Frasier's sofa on my way toward Daphne's bedroom. "Daphne?" I knocked on her door and opened it.</p>

		<p>And was greeted by no one. "Daphne?"</p>

		<p>I stormed back out to the living room. "Daphne?" I glared at my brother. "Where is she, Frasier? I've got to talk to her."</p>

		<p>He looked surprised. Then resigned. "The balcony, Niles. Check the balcony."</p>

		<p align="center">*****</p>

		<p>I heard him from where I was sitting on the balcony yelling for me. I didn't move. I didn't have the energy to move, much less to have a deep conversation with him about why I'd broken up with Donny.</p>

		<p>I should've known Doctor Crane would tell him where I was.</p>

		<p>The balcony door opened, and he came out. He was wearing his grey dress slacks, the loose ones that hang so nicely, a dress shirt, the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, a tie, and his usual suspenders. He was carrying his suit jacket over his arm.</p>

		<p>He glanced down at me.</p>

		<p>And handed me his jacket.</p>

		<p>"Thank you."</p>

		<p>He nodded and walked to the edge of the balcony, leaning against the railing, gazing at the night sky. "The moon's full."</p>

		<p>I nodded and then realized he wasn't looking at me. "Yes, 't is."</p>

		<p>We were quiet for a little while. I closed my eyes and breathed in the cold Seattle air as I pulled his coat around me.</p>

		<p>"I'm sorry, Daphne." I didn't open my eyes. I didn't say anything. I heard him shift a bit. "What you told me -- what we shared -- was private. I had no business disclosing that to Frasier. I wish I hadn't."</p>

		<p>I nodded but kept my eyes shut. I could almost feel him watching me. I heard him shift again, and I could sense that he'd turned away. Back toward the moon.</p>

		<p>"And I'm sorry about Donny. This must be hard." I nodded again.</p>

		<p>"Daphne, do you still want children... someday?" The question startled me, and I opened my eyes. He wasn't looking at me. He was leaning heavily against the rail, his back turned toward me. I leaned my face into his jacket a bit. I'm not sure if the smell is cologne or just -- him -- but it's a smell I've always associated with him. It's very distinctive, his alone. It smells like -- it sounds strange, I know -- it smells like the sea. Salty and sweet.</p>

		<p>I wonder if he liked the sea, when he was a little boy?</p>

		<p>I wonder if he waded in the water, watched it come up over his ankles.</p>

		<p>"Yes, I still want children."</p>

		<p>He nodded, almost to himself. "How many, Daphne?"</p>

		<p>I smiled and closed my eyes. "Two. A boy and a girl."</p>

		<p>"What will they be like, Daphne?"</p>

		<p>My eyes were still closed, and I imagined my children. "They'll be smart. So, so smart. Full of wit and grace. Loving. Excited by the most minor details. Ceaselessly amazed by life and everything in it."</p>

		<p>"They'll be amazed by you. They'll try their whole lives to be as wonderful and loyal and loving as you."</p>

		<p>"And they'll be a lady and a gentleman. They'll appreciate the finer aspects of life. They won't grow up like I did. Not that I complain, mind you, I treasure my days growing up. But their childhood won't be like that."</p>

		<p>He sighed. "They'll be perfect. They'll be yours."</p>

		<p>He's amazing, altogether. He says the most wonderful, most beautiful things to me.</p>

		<p>But this -- he's never been like this before.</p>

		<p>"What about you?"</p>

		<p>He glanced back at me and then turned toward me, leaning his back against the railing now. We looked at each other for the first time that night. "What about me what?"</p>

		<p>"Do you want children? A long time ago, you thought you might."</p>

		<p>He smiled self-consciously. "No, I tried to convince myself then that I did, but it wasn't the right time for me. Maris wasn't the right person for me. The circumstances weren't right, and I only ended up proving that to myself."</p>

		<p>I took a deep breath. "What about now?"</p>

		<p>He barked out a self-deprecatory laugh. "Well, currently finding myself unattached, I imagine it would be quite a feat to have children." I just stared at him, trying to tell him I wouldn't let him get away without answering. He sighed. "If you're trying to ask me if I can still see myself having children, being a father, then yes. The answer is yes."</p>

		<p>"What will they be like?"</p>

		<p>He shook his head. "Of course, in all likelihood, I'll never have the opportunity to know, but...." He paused. "I've always envisioned by perfect future in a particular way.</p>

		<p>"I'm sitting in my living room at Montana on the fainting couch. There's a novel on the couch beside me, folded down at a certain page. I've been reading aloud from it.</p>

		<p>"There's a little girl, maybe six, asleep in my lap. Her name... maybe it's Hester. Whatever her name, it will be something with a grand meaning. Something that took us a long time to decide on, but it's perfect.</p>

		<p>"All of a sudden, a little brown-haired ten-year old boy comes bounding down the stairs. His name..." He smiled fondly. "Well, it will probably be Frasier, in all honesty. He runs toward me, but I gesture for him to be quiet, because his sister's asleep. So he comes to sit next to me. He sits up straight and tall and gracefully at first, but then he leans into my shoulder. I put my arm around him. He's sleepy because he's been practicing his piano all day just so he could impress me with the first of the Goldberg variations when I came home from work. And he did.</p>

		<p>"And then she comes out onto the balcony that overlooks the living room, and she smiles at us. It's that smile that makes my knees weaken."</p>

		<p>I smiled. He sat down, leaning against the bars of the railing, so that he was opposite me. His knees were pulled up toward him, his elbows resting on his knees, his hands clasped between them. "'Frasier,' she says." He paused. "She still feels a bit uncomfortable saying the name. 'Frasier,' she says. 'Come back up here. Your father'll tuck you in in a bit.'" He closed his eyes. He was living the scene out in his mind. "So our son runs up to her. He's so alive, just like her. She takes him to his room. I pick up our daughter and carry her up to her room. I'm tucking her in when she comes up behind me and wraps her arms around me. 'Your son's waiting for you,' she whispers to me. I turn around and hold her. She kisses me. And I'm so, so happy."</p>

		<p>"What's she like?"</p>

		<p>He opened his eyes and looked down. "Well, she's very beautiful. And very sweet. Oh, and that smile...." He closed his eyes again. "She's the love of my life." I wanted to cry. He shook his head. "Of course, that's just the ideal. It won't work out that way. Nothing ever works out how I plan."</p>

		<p>"So don't plan." He looked at me curiously. "Just let it happen."</p>

		<p>He shook his head. "If only."</p>

		<p>I glanced up at the moon. It's a very powerful thing, the moon. Makes people act in strange ways. "I don't blame you, you know." He raised an eyebrow. "In fact, I suppose I should be thanking you. To marry Donny --" I shook my head. "Would have been a mistake. I know that, now."</p>

		<p>Music drifted down from the upstairs apartment. I smiled. "Sounds like Mr. Sports Utility Vehicle is having another party." I closed my eyes. It was that old B.E. King song, Stand By Me. The lyrics floated down faintly. "When the night has come and the land is dark and the moon is the only light we'll see, I won't cry. I won't cry. No, I won't shed a tear. Just as long as you stand. Stand by me."</p>

		<p>He sighed. "I am here for you, you know. However you need me."</p>

		<p>I nodded. "I know you are. You always have been."</p>

		<p>He nodded. "Of course I have been. It's because --" He stopped abruptly and looked down.</p>

		<p>I reach across the breach between us and took his hands, which were still clasped together between his knees. He looked up at me. "You can say it, you know. I've been waiting to hear it since Christmas."</p>

		<p align="center">*****</p>

		<p>What?</p>

		<p>"What did you just say?"</p>

		<p>She smiled nervously. "Come sit next to me."</p>

		<p>I nodded nervously and crawled over to sit beside her. She kept hold of my hands.</p>

		<p>"I'll tell you a secret."</p>

		<p>I glanced over at her. She wasn't looking at me. She sat with her right shoulder pressed tightly against my left, holding my left hand in her lap between both of hers, but she was watching the sky. "What secret is that?"</p>

		<p>"Do you remember the last time we were out here together?"</p>

		<p>"It's been a while. Since Christmas."</p>

		<p>She nodded. "You brought me out here to ask for Mel's Christmas present."</p>

		<p>I closed my eyes. I should never have. What she must have thought of me. "Yes, I did." I paused. "You were going to tell me a secret."</p>

		<p>"The secret was that I thought you'd brought me out here for an entirely different reason."</p>

		<p>"You thought --"</p>

		<p>She sighed melodramatically. "But, NO. You just wanted to steal back my Christmas present. Should've known then never to trust you. You can never trust the honest looking blokes. It's all a disguise." She sighed dramatically.</p>

		<p>I rolled my eyes and hit her lightly. "Oh, you. As if you're any better. You're positively evil. A temptress in lamb's clothing."</p>

		<p>She hit me back. It's our little game. I hit her, and she hit me. And then it became war. I suppose, as distractions go, this was a good one. We needed a break in the tension. I grasped in vain for her hands, and she began to tickle me.</p>

		<p>Has the woman no mercy?</p>

		<p>I finally caught her hands and looked over at her in triumph. She was giggling madly. She looked incredible.</p>

		<p>But, presently, the reality of the cold, hard concrete under me and the unresolved problem between us came back to me.</p>

		<p>What she had meant was slowly dawning on me. "Seriously, Daphne." I paused, sobering a bit but still grinning from our mock-fight. "You thought I was going to tell you that --"</p>

		<p>She interrupted me with a good-natured smirk, elbowing me slightly. "Yes. I thought you were going to tell me THAT." We were still clasping each other's hands, and now she looked down at our joined fingers. She was running her thumb back and forth over the back of my hand.</p>

		<p>Oh, my God. My smile changed to a look of awe. "Good God. You've known since then?"</p>

		<p>A slight nod. "Yes. Your brother let it slip. He's quite the blabbermouth, he is."</p>

		<p>I couldn't possibly be angry with him. It was all too ironic. I just shook my head at the humor. "Don't I know it." I leaned my head back against the building and laughed softly. "Oh, but Daphne, what you must've thought of me."</p>

		<p>She leaned her head back as I had mine. I followed her gaze to the top of the Space Needle. She laughed softly. "I was shocked. I never would have guessed in a thousand years."</p>

		<p>I looked at her. "No?"</p>

		<p>She smiled. "It was just so unexpected. You and me? No, I never would have guessed."</p>

		<p>I've sort of though, at least for the past year or so, that the real reason she's never commented was she didn't reciprocate my feelings. She's certainly hinted in the past that she knew, with all of her talk of sensing feelings through intuition. "Why not, Daphne? Why is it so hard to imagine? You've got to have realized how much I care for you."</p>

		<p>She nodded, still not looking at me. "I know that you do. But I'd never have thought you'd have thought of us as a..." She grinned self-consciously. "... a couple."</p>

		<p>I watched her carefully. "Why, Daphne?"</p>

		<p>She sighed. "I clean your brother's house for a living. What else is there to say? I'm an employee."</p>

		<p>I shook my head. "No, Daphne. And if I've ever, ever treated you as such...."</p>

		<p>She smiled and squeezed my hand. "You haven't. You've never. But I suppose because I've always differentiated between us in that way, I only assumed you did as well."</p>

		<p>"And then Frasier told you."</p>

		<p>"He was a bit drugged up on those tranquilizers for his back. And he told me."</p>

		<p>"And you've known since then." She nodded. "And you've been waiting for me to tell you."</p>

		<p>She shook her head. "Not exactly waiting. The longer I went without seeing anything, the more I convinced myself your brother was wrong."</p>

		<p>"I'm so sorry, Daphne. If I'd known...." I drifted off. She didn't say anything. "I'll tell you now."</p>

		<p>She turned toward me. "Do you still feel it?"</p>

		<p>I shook my head, laughing a bit. At myself, of course. "When have I not?"</p>

		<p>She smiled. "Tell me."</p>

		<p>I looked into her eyes. "I love you, Daphne. So much."</p>

		<p>She leaned into me, and I wrapped my arms around her. "That makes me feel so much better. I needed that."</p>

		<p>"So did I, Daphne. So did I."</p>

		<p>I glanced behind me through the glass of Frasier's balcony doors. He was standing beside his couch talking to Dad. I watched him for a bit before he walked over to check on us and saw me. He looked down at me curiously. I smiled and nodded, and he beamed and walked back toward Dad. I'm happy. And that makes my brother happy.</p>

		<p>Frasier's upstairs enemy was still playing music. The Rolling Stones, this time. Music from the British invasion. It seems applicable. The music floated down. "You can't always get what you want. But if you try sometimes you just might find you get what you need."</p>

		<p>No, she didn't tell me that she loved me that night. I don't suppose she was ready for that yet, and I wasn't about to push her.</p>

		<p>So I didn't exactly get what I wanted, a confirmation of her own feelings for me.</p>

		<p>But I got what I needed. I needed to hold her. I needed for her to know how I felt, from the bottom of my heart.</p>

		<p>I suppose that was enough for now.</p>

		<p>And I was determined, now, to wait for her. For as long as it took.</p>

		<p>And nothing's more determined than a cat on a hot tin roof, is there?</p>
