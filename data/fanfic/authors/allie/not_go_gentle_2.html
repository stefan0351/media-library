<!-- To Not Go Gentle \ Laws Of Silence Indeed -->

<p>I heaved a sigh as I unlocked the front door of Elliot Bay Towers' apartment 1901.</p>

		<p>Bloody hell. What a night.</p>

		<p>The lights were low, but they were awake, watching tv. The screen sent out a bright, fluorescent glow illuminating Mister Crane, Doctor Crane, and... Roz?</p>

		<p>As I walked in, they all looked up, startled, and Doctor Crane jumped up to switch on the overhead lights. "Daphne! Where have you been? We thought you'd be at Roz's, but when we called and you weren't there... and you weren't at Donny's...." He rubbed his face. "Well, you've been so tense these past few days, I thought maybe...." He stamped his foot. "Oh, all right, I was worried about you. There, are you all happy?"</p>

		<p>I smiled nervously at him. "No worries. I'm fine."</p>

		<p>Roz stood up and walked over. "Well, Daph, where'd you go? I mean, you never stopped by my place, so we sorta got concerned. And, like Frasier said, Donny hadn't seen you either, so --"</p>

		<p>I raised an eyebrows at her. "Well, Roz, I would've come by, but a certain cuddly canine was parked in front of your building...."</p>

		<p>She blushed and sat back down on the sofa, avoiding Doctor Crane's glare. "Bulldog, Roz? Is THAT what you said I was interrupting? Oh, for God's sake." He turned back to me, his face taking on a sudden pleading quality. "Well, where'd you go, Daphne?"</p>

		<p>Mister Crane stood up from his chair, leaning on his cane. "Aw, Jeez, Fras. Leave the poor kid alone. As if it's any of your business." With that, he waved his goodnights and hobbled back to his room.</p>

		<p>Doctor Crane waited until he was gone. "I'm serious, Daphne. Where have you been?"</p>

		<p>"I said leave her alone, you moron!" Mister Crane's yell echoed from the back of the apartment. I grinned.</p>

		<p>"I went to visit your brother, all right?"</p>

		<p>He looked surprised. "Oh, really?"</p>

		<p>I watched him carefully. "And just why is that so bloody hard to believe?"</p>

		<p>He responded in that little innocent, sing-songy tone he has which is really not innocent at all. "Oh, no, Daphne. Not at all hard to believe. Not at all." He leaned slightly on the arm of the couch, picking at the suede absently, his chin raised slightly as his eyes were trained down at his hand in the same expression his brother has when he's about to say something he's either embarrassed or ashamed about but wants to look innocent. "So did you two have a good time?"</p>

		<p>I rolled my eyes. "Oh, bloody hell. We talked. That's it. Why does it matter to you?" I walked past him toward my room.</p>

		<p>He kept the same expression, eyes down, chin up. "Oh, really? Talked about what?"</p>

		<p>I'd had about enough of him by that time, let me assure you, so I turned around, my hands on my hips. "No, we didn't talk about you. We didn't talk about women who might or might not be dating possibilities for you. We didn't talk about your behavior. We didn't talk about your merits or your many, many faults. We didn't talk about you at all." Roz sniggered a bit. "We talked about personal things."</p>

		<p>His head shot up. Oh, dear, now he's going to think -- "He told you?" Sure enough. Roz looked surprised, as well. She's the only one I'd confided in regarding my little Christmas discovery. She was asking me a thousand questions with her expression: "He told you? What did you say? What did you do? Did you disappoint him? Did you give in to him? Did he kiss you? Did you kiss him? Have you spent the past two hours making the beast with two backs?" I could see them all running through her head (if you ask me, she could stand to grow up just a bit, clean out that filthy mind of hers), and it made me crazy. After all, I've been trying to block out Doctor Crane's little disclosure for months, but every time Doctor Crane touches me or hugs me or looks at me, I feel.... And tonight was worst of all. Or best of all. Or bloody something.</p>

		<p>But I was blocking it out. Out of my mind. Slamming the door on any thoughts of that nature. Really, as if I needed to be thinking such things with just three weeks to go before I tie the knot!</p>

		<p>I frowned at them, feeling close to tears, ready to burst. "Oh, bloody hell! If anything HAD happened, you two would be the LAST BLOODY PAIR ON EARTH I'd tell!" I yelled in frustration as I stormed back to my room.</p>

		<p>Dear God. With ragged emotions and raging hormones like these, it's a wonder I'm NOT pregnant.</p>

		<p>Behind me, I could hear Mister Crane, muttering, "I told you not to ask her, Fras, but do you ever listen? No...."</p>
