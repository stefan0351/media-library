<!-- To Not Go Gentle \ The Charm Of The Defeated -->

<p>I closed Daphne's door behind me, Eddie at my feet. I know how the woman values her privacy, after all.</p>

		<p>Niles was in the hall waiting for me, looking anxious, but when he saw my face he slumped. "I'm sorry, Niles. I couldn't do anything."</p>

		<p>He nodded as we walked toward my living room. "Well, I've got to meet Mel in half an hour at any rate."</p>

		<p>I glanced at my watch. Nine o'clock. "So late?"</p>

		<p>He nodded. "Yes, apparently she has a patient who insists only to come out at night. This pushes Mel's evening schedule back considerably." He glanced at my sofa and lowered himself onto it. "Well, Frasier, I've got a few minutes, at least. Will you tell me what she said?"</p>

		<p>I rolled my eyes. "Oh, Niles, are you actually trying to tell me you didn't eavesdrop through the door?"</p>

		<p>He gasped dramatically. "Frasier, I'm appalled that you'd think such a thing!" I glared at him. "Oh, all right, I tried, but the wood of her door is abnormally sound-proof."</p>

		<p>"Well, I told her not to blame you because it was my fault." He looked hopeful. "But she said that it was your fault." He frowned. "So I told her you just needed my advice." Again, hope. "And she said you needed to grow up enough not to depend on other people's advice."</p>

		<p>He looked indignant. "I do not request your advice! You force it upon me! This is your fault, Frasier."</p>

		<p>"Oh, will you be quiet for two seconds? So then I said that you care for her very much and didn't want to risk giving overly hasty advice and therefore needed a sound second opinion, because you wanted to do what was best for her." He raised his eyebrow questioningly. "And she said that if you didn't know by now what was best for her, you never would."</p>

		<p>He looked confused. And disturbed. "Frasier, this doesn't sound like it was just about Donny."</p>

		<p>"Well, let me tell you, that's EXACTLY what I said to her."</p>

		<p>"And she said...?"</p>

		<p>I thought for a moment. "Well, she didn't say anything, come to think of it. She just looked down at her lap."</p>

		<p>He shook his head and stood up. "Oh, for God's sake, you'd think after seven years I'd have learned. I should just let her marry him and get on with her life."</p>

		<p>What?</p>

		<p>What?</p>

		<p>My brother, conceding defeat?</p>

		<p>"What?"</p>

		<p>He nodded. "I'm serious, Frasier. I'm in a good relationship right now, and Daphne's getting married. Oh, sure, I'll probably never stop thinking about her, but more than anything I want her to be happy. And I think, at this point, we'd both be happiest if I were to simply leave well enough alone. To paraphrase a play I've had on my mind a lot recently, Frasier, well... well, damn it, I feel all the time like a cat on a hot tin roof, and it's an uncomfortable place to stay on too long. I think it's my time to jump off, and cats always land uninjured."</p>

		<p>I stood up, lifting my arms in the air. "No, brother! 'Do not go gentle into that good night! Rage, rage against the dying of the light!'"</p>

		<p>He rolled his eyes at me. "Oh, come now, Frasier, I hardly think a poem about death is applicable here. Don't you think you're being a bit dramatic?"</p>

		<p>"And you haven't over the past years been dramatic about this unrequited infatuation/lust/love you have for her? What about that little Tennessee Williams reference you just spouted? Good God, man, all I'm saying is that you can't give up now! I agreed with your little diagnosis regarding her visions, and I frankly think that for her to marry him would be a mistake."</p>

		<p>He shook his head. "Frasier, there comes a point when one must simply trust a person's judgment. Daphne knows what is best for Daphne. I've given her something to consider, and if she decides to act on that, it will be because she thinks it best, not us." He put on his overcoat. "Now, Frasier, I bid you adieu. Take care."</p>

		<p>I slumped on the couch and nodded. "All right, Niles. Have a good time with Mel."</p>

		<p>He smiled a bit. "I plan to, Frasier."</p>
