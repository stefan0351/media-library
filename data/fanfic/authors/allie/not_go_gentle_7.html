<!-- To Not Go Gentle \ A Crack In The Wall? -- Of Composure? or Martin Tracks Him Down -->

<p>When I finally found him, he was sitting in the park, Eddie's leash wrapped about ten times around his ankles. He was bent over, his elbows on his knees, his face buried in his hands. His hair was all out of place and everything. His trenchcoat was falling open, all crooked and stuff. His tie was loosened, and the top button of his shirt was unbuttoned.</p>

		<p>Aww, Jeez. Something's eating him.</p>

		<p>Bad, too.</p>

		<p>Niles usually doesn't let anybody see him when he's not immaculately groomed. I mean, ever since he was a kid, it's been, 'Dad, could you make sure my hair's combed down in the back?' or 'Dad, would you press my tie?' or 'Dad, did you take my boy scout uniform to the dry cleaners?' or 'Dad, what do you think you can do about these stains in my cooking apron?' or, for that week that I made him try tee-ball, 'Dad, if I have to wear this ridiculous jersey, could we at least bleach it so it's not quite so dingy?' Ah, who was he kidding? He didn't play long enough to even get dust on it. The first time he swung the bat at the ball, he missed and hit the tee. He got so scared when the rubber tee bounced back at him that he ran crying into the stands, where Hester told him he didn't have to play if he didn't want to. He'll tell you he won't go to baseball games because he can't stand the smell of boiled peanuts, but now you know the REAL story.</p>

		<p>But the point is that something had to be really out of whack for him to be like this in a public place.</p>

		<p>Which reminds me, something's missing in this picture. He left with -- Aw, man, how could I have missed it? I rushed up to him -- well, as much as I can rush anywhere. "Hey, Niles, where's Eddie?!?"</p>

		<p>No worry, though. The little guy poked his head out from under the bench, right between my son's ankles. Thank God.</p>

		<p>Niles looked up at me, then. And boy did he look like he'd been through the wringer. "Hi, Dad."</p>

		<p>I sat down beside him. "What's wrong, son?"</p>

		<p>He shook his head. "It's a really long story, Dad."</p>

		<p>My eyes widened as I remembered a story I myself'd heard just a little while ago. "That reminds me of a story I just heard a little while ago. Donny came by! Yea, something about Daph being pregnant! Then, like five minutes after he left, FRASIER and ROZ came by, all sweaty and panting, saying they had to FIND Donny!" I shook my head. "Can you imagine?"</p>

		<p>He looked at me like he could imagine that very well.</p>

		<p>I took a deep breath. "I was hoping Daphne'd be here with you, to be honest. I came to apologize to her. I was pretty bad to her this morning." I stopped. "Ya know, come to think of it, I've been pretty bad to her for a couple of weeks now. I think it's just because she's leaving. I'm really gonna miss her, and I guess I'm trying to sort of cut the tie voluntarily before I have to let her go. Distancing myself, you know. Maybe I think it'll hurt less this way." I elbowed him. "How's that for some psychiatry from your old dad?" He smiled weakly, and I shook my head. "Aww, Jeez, son, is what Donny said what this is about? Damn. I can imagine how hard this is. I mean, you never really had to deal with it before, but now that she's pregnant --"</p>

		<p>"She's not pregnant, Dad."</p>

		<p>I looked over at him. "What?"</p>

		<p>And that's when he started on the whole story. Every damn sentence of it.</p>

		<p>Poor kid. The things he goes through. He's always had it rough, ever since he was a kid.</p>

		<p>"It's okay, son. We'll get through this."</p>
