<!-- To Not Go Gentle \ Enviably Cool, For A Time -->

<p>The next day, I walked into Cafe Nervosa at my standard time to find Niles already seated, apparently waiting for me. Just the man I wanted to see.</p>

		<p>"Niles!" I cried jovially as I approached him. I wanted to assure he'd be open to discussing this with me. "So how did last night go?"</p>

		<p>He watched me curiously as he stirred his coffee. "How did what exactly about last night go?"</p>

		<p>The waitress approached. "What will you be having, sir?"</p>

		<p>I smiled. "My usual." She looked doubtful. "Oh, for God's sake, just make something up!" She left abruptly, and I grinned innocently at my brother. "Why, your date with Mel, of course."</p>

		<p>He looked down indifferently. "Oh. She was detained. I haven't seen her today, either. She's had back to back surgeries all day."</p>

		<p>I tried to hold up my carefree facade before I broke down, leaned on the table, and looked at him desperately. "Oh, come on, Niles. I know you were with Daphne last night. Tell me what happened. I simply must know!"</p>

		<p>He looked up with that incredulous but bored looked plastered on his face. "Oh, you must, must you?"</p>

		<p>Oh, how he infuriates me....</p>

		<p>"Oh, come on, Niles." It wasn't exactly a whine, but it was embarrassingly close. "You know you can't keep anything from me for too long. We tell each other everything. It's... it's brotherly bonding. You can't break that now."</p>

		<p>I could see his resolve cracking. "Why? Did Daphne say something about it?"</p>

		<p>I eyed him and grinned suggestively. "Oh, she said enough, Niles. She said enough...."</p>

		<p>He looked shocked. "What do you mean?"</p>

		<p>I rolled my eyes. "Oh, I can put two and two together, Niles. She's been miserable and tense all week long. She goes to your apartment, where all sorts of things are revealed and you have a deep personal discussion, and she comes home a new woman." I paused. "You told her, didn't you?"</p>

		<p>He blinked several times dumbly. "No, Frasier, I told her nothing, although I find myself frankly flattered you'd assume such a revelation would cause said effect in our Daphne." He says that, sometimes, and it always carries a note of sad and resigned fondness: "Our Daphne." He tries to make some part of her his.</p>

		<p>I'm embarrassed to admit that it took me so long to realize he's really in love with her.</p>

		<p>He took a sip of his coffee as mine arrived.</p>

		<p>"All right, Niles. You don't have to tell me anything." I crossed my legs and looked across the Cafe, taking small sips of my coffee (NOT my usual -- apparently my suggestion of making something up had been taken seriously), avoiding watching his own annoying stirring and sipping routine. First, my fingers began tapping the table. Then, my foot started twitching nervously. I turned to him. "Oh, I can't take it anymore! You've got to tell me."</p>

		<p>He sighed and leaned back in his chair. "Oh, all right. But only because I need a bit of advice from you. Let's call it a psychological second opinion."</p>

		<p>I nodded. "All right."</p>

		<p>I took a sip of my coffee.</p>

		<p>"Daphne told me last night that she thought she was pregnant."</p>

		<p>And promptly spewed it all over my brother's face.</p>

		<p>He grimaced in disgust and pulled out his handkerchief to dab his brow. "Yes, Frasier, nothing cries brotherly bonding like your own flesh and blood's flying spittle."</p>

		<p>I ignored him. "She told you WHAT?"</p>

		<p>He smiled wryly. "Yes, I had a similar reaction. Only instead of being unable to swallow, I found myself unable to breathe. She had to calm me down."</p>

		<p>Oh, Lord. He attempts to blames his condition on an "abnormally small windpipe." I could just imagine poor Daphne's face. "I'm sure you made quite a little scene."</p>

		<p>"I won't tell you if you continue to interject. Or if you spit again, for that matter."</p>

		<p>I waved him on, dabbing my upper lip with my handkerchief. "Continue, brother."</p>

		<p>"Yes. Ahem. She told me she thought she might be -- Daphne."</p>

		<p>"How astute of her. And you wonder why I hired her," I muttered before noticing my brother gazing at the door of the Cafe. I followed his line of sight. "Oh. Daphne."</p>

		<p>"Daphne!" he called out, standing. She smiled and made her way over to us. And leaned over to give him a quick kiss on the cheek.</p>

		<p>What?</p>

		<p>"I saw the two of you sitting in here and simply had to come say hello. How is everyone? It's such a lovely day today that I couldn't stand to be cooped up in the apartment."</p>

		<p>He was gazing at her, smiling, satisfied. "Yes, it's beautiful. And we're simply wonderful. How about joining us?" He gestured to the seat beside his and even pulled it out slightly.</p>

		<p>She laughed and smiled. "Oh, no. I can't stay. Your father and Eddie are outside waiting, and I've got to meet a girlfriend of mine for lunch in just a few minutes. She's only just flown in, so I of course made this lunch a top priority. You see, I was going to have lunch today with Donny, but now we've rescheduled for tonight." When you want to hear the whole story, every mundane detail, go to our Daphne.</p>

		<p>I watched my brother carefully at her mention of Donny. His face clouded briefly, but not to the extent that it usually does. I looked up at her. "Well, goodbye, Daphne," I said softly. My God. Pregnant? She's having dinner with Donny. To tell him?</p>

		<p>How is my brother still standing?</p>

		<p>She smiled. "G'day Doctor Crane, Doctor Crane."</p>

		<p>Niles smiled. "Yes, goodbye, Daphne." Oh, the way he says her name. He puts a slow emphasis on the first syllable and glides smoothly over the second, always slightly bashful, as if he's in awe of it. It's amazing, really. I wonder if I'll ever say a woman's name like that.</p>

		<p>Lilith.</p>

		<p>LIL-ith.</p>

		<p>LI-lith.</p>

		<p>No, it doesn't quite have the same ring to it, does it?</p>

		<p>He paused. "Perhaps I'll see you again today."</p>

		<p>She nodded, still smiling, and left. I turned to my brother. "Pregnant?"</p>

		<p>He tore his eyes away from her and shook his head. "No, she was scared she was. You see, she'd had these visions --" I rolled my eyes. "-- and she's been having nightmares, and --" He looked down self-consciously, his cheeks turning red. "Well, you know."</p>

		<p>I sniggered incredulously. "Let me guess. Her cycle's not quite in line with her star sign this month."</p>

		<p>He shot a harsh glare at me. "Don't you dare mock her, Frasier."</p>

		<p>I bristled. He's never gotten angry with me for joking about Daphne's oddities before. Yes, I've heard him angry with Dad before for arguing with her, and there was that instance with his poor couple's therapy group when he yelled at dear Janice that Daphne was clean and pure and decent, but he's usually not truly angry with me about her. "I was kidding, Niles." He sighed and relaxed. "Go on."</p>

		<p>"These visions -- there were three. The first was the same as the old, the faceless man in a wedding tuxedo."</p>

		<p>I rolled my eyes. "Any more dragons to speak of?" Dad told me about that one later. Oh, Daphne, Daphne, Daphne. Dear, eccentric Daphne.</p>

		<p>He looked confused. "No, no. Just a man." He paused. "In the second, she wasn't simply an onlooker, she was a participant. She was holding a baby, I assume her child, and this same man, I assume the father, is standing behind her." He sighed. "The third is of a little boy wading in the water at a beach. She calls to him and reaches for him, and he turns toward her."</p>

		<p>I sat up straighter. Daphne has always fascinated me psychologically, but I've never felt free to openly analyze her. Now, the chance was amazingly tempting. Yet these "visions" seemed... well, too ordinary for Daphne. "Niles, you said she was having nightmares and was scared about being pregnant. These images seem perfectly happy. Anticipatory, in fact."</p>

		<p>Niles nodded. "And that's what I asked her. She told me that what frightened her was that the child clearly wasn't hers. He had blonde hair and blue eyes."</p>

		<p>He said that deliberately, as if I was supposed to garner from it some great meaning. I sighed. "Niles, you want this all to point to you, but it doesn't have to. You realize that."</p>

		<p>He shook his head. "I do. I do realize that. But that's not why I want you to hear this out."</p>

		<p>I nodded. "All right. Go ahead."</p>

		<p>"So I pondered this and thought to myself, 'But Daphne's always wanted children!' So I asked her. 'I thought you wanted children?' Do you know what she said, Frasier?" His eyes gleamed. I shook my head. "She said, 'But not--' and stopped. I asked her to continue. She said that she'd been about to say 'But not Donny's,' before she caught herself. She brushed it off as silly and ridiculous, but Frasier...."</p>

		<p>"All right, Niles, so how do you know she's not pregnant?"</p>

		<p>He leaned back and took a sip of his coffee haughtily, as if I should have known all along. "Because she took the test at my apartment."</p>

		<p>She what?</p>

		<p>"She what?"</p>

		<p>"You heard me."</p>

		<p>I sighed. This was growing stranger by the second. "And it was negative."</p>

		<p>He looked at me curiously. "I've never seen her so scared as before she found out, and I've rarely seen her so happy as she was after she got the result. She stayed at the Montana afterward to eat the desert I'd prepared for Mel." He paused. "What's your take on all this, Frasier? I don't want to think I'm jumping to a hasty conclusion, you know, seeing simply what I want to see. I did that last time, and we see what happened."</p>

		<p>"Well, Niles, as much as I hate to get your hopes up, it sounds to me as thought she's having serious subconscious reservations about her relationship with Donny. A child psychologically represents a part of oneself which will eternally join one to another person. Regardless of divorce, regardless of death, half of a child will always be someone else. That represents a huge commitment, and she is clearly not prepared to make one of this magnitude to him. And if she's not prepared for this, she can't logically think she's prepared for marriage."</p>

		<p>Niles nodded thoughtfully. "Your thoughts echo mine precisely." He looked up at me. "And do you realize what this could mean for me? She's been my dream, Frasier, for seven years. Now I find incontrovertible proof that she is not satisfied with her current state of involvement. If I could -- If she could -- Oh, Frasier, I felt so close to her last night." He gazed off into space dreamily in that way he only has when speaking of her. I coughed and glared at him.</p>

		<p>"Niles, if she ends her engagement, you must not approach her too quickly. She'll need time."</p>

		<p>He returned my glare. "You tell me that every time, Frasier, and it ruins me every time!" He sighed. "But, Frasier, she has no intention of leaving him. You realize that. She's loyal to the core. She would never spring this on him now, at least not without some serious influence behind her. Perhaps the influence of a psychiatrist...." He paused and looked up at me. "Will you talk to her, Frasier?"</p>

		<p>I did a double take. "What? Of course not! I think we both know whose place it is to talk to her."</p>

		<p>He crinkled his brow a bit and then smiled. "Of course! Roz!"</p>

		<p>"Oh, for God's sake! It's you, you numbskull! Good Lord, this coffee's terrible! I'm leaving!"</p>

		<p>"Oh, no you're not. Because I'm leaving." He set his coffee cup down, lifted his briefcase, and stood up. "Goodbye, brother. I'll see you later."</p>

		<p>I was still sitting at the table, a grimace plastered on my face, when Roz walked up and took her seat where Niles had been. She rolled her eyes. "Oh, Lord, Frasier, who died? What's eating YOU?"</p>

		<p>I pondered impatiently whether or not to tell her. Finally I shook my head and said tensely, "Oh, all right. The reason Daphne has been acting strangely is that she thought she was pregnant."</p>

		<p>Roz looked up, astonished. "Daphne's PREGNANT?" she practically yelled.</p>

		<p>And then, as if the whole situation wasn't terrible enough, a little wiry black head of hair turned toward us from the door to the Cafe, through which he had just entered. His eyes were wide, his mouth agape. He looked confused, as if he didn't know whether to be delighted or utterly stricken. He seemed to be favoring "stricken." "Daph's pregnant?"</p>
