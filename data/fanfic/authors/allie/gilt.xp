		<h2 align="center">Is It Hot Out Here, Or Is It Me?</h2>
		<p>At the ring of Doctor Frasier Crane's doorbell, I looked up anxiously,
		expecting his brother, Niles, to walk into the room.</p>

		<p>It didn't happen, of course.  It was Roz Doyle, Doctor Crane's producer and
		one of my closest friends.  I felt hideously guilty at the disappointment I
		felt,  so,  before she could see me, I escaped to the balcony, leaning
		heavily on the rail, gazing absently at Seattle's famous Space Needle.</p>

		<p>I honestly don't know why I always expected Doctor Crane... Niles.  It
		hadn't been Niles for weeks.  And I had no bloody idea why.</p>

		<p>Other than Mel, of course.  He'd been seeing a lot of her, I knew.  It
		didn't bother me, though.</p>

		<p>Really, it didn't.</p>

		<p>From the balcony, I could hear Frasier and Roz talking in the living room.
		Something about this morning's show.  Or one of Roz's men.  Arguing about
		something trivial, no doubt.  They fool themselves, I think.  I overheard
		Frasier the night Alice Doyle was born.  He called Roz lovely.  "That's
		exactly  how you look," he said.  "Lovely."  Of course, then he tried to
		pick up her nurse.  Yes, he's fooling himself.  Oh well.</p>

		<p>You know, Doctor Crane's recent behavior (Frasier, not his brother) was one
		thing that really made me realize the magnitude of my impending marriage.
		To the outsider, I suppose it wouldn't be that amazing: Frasier Crane
		answered his front door.  Big deal.  Yet only a week before, Frasier would
		have sat  like granite on that ridiculous couch of his, sipping sherry,
		expecting resolutely that I would answer the bloody door for him.  Now,
		though, so soon  before  my departure  from my make-shift family, he's
		decided to start taking these things into his own hands.  I'm impressed in a
		sort of pity-inducing way (for  him,  not myself).</p>

		<p>Their voices stayed distant, but I could make them out.</p>

		<p>"Seriously, Fras, is she okay?  She's been acting strangely....  She hasn't
		mentioned anything?" . . .</p>

		<p>I tried to tune them out.  The last thing I wanted to hear were their
		perceptions of my mood.  As if I'd been acting strangely!  Everyone acts...
		oddly...  days before such a monumental event.  Could they really expect me
		to handle this with absolute resolve?</p>

		<p>They continued for awhile about me.  Various suspicions about my
		relationship with Mr. Donald Ronald Douglas, I suppose.  And then they began
		talking about Niles.  I listened.</p>

		<p>"So where's he been, anyway, Frasier?"</p>

		<p>He sighed and, as I glanced into the room, he slouched down beside Roz on
		the sofa.  He's so melodramatic when he wants to be.  "He's been staying far
		away from here.  You know how he feels about the wedding."  He sighed again,
		and I listened even more closely.  "Besides, he has this thing with Mel
		now."</p>

		<p>Roz laughed a bit.  "Yea, I understand why he's not been coming around.  I
		mean, I try to imagine how I would feel....  If I had really been in love
		with  Donny.  How would I feel, watching someone I trust so much take him
		away?"  She sighed.  "I suppose it's a good thing I never really develop
		ties with  anyone.  Nothing lasting or loving, at least."  She glanced up at
		him with amazing sincerity from where she was sitting beside him.  I swear
		to God I think they're blind.  But then again, I guess I am, too.
		Oh, Doctor Crane....  Roz looked down again.  "And this thing with Mel....
		He can't be serious,  Frasier.  He really can't be.  She's a bitch."  She
		looked up suddenly.  "He's only fooling himself, you know, and I think
		that's the worst thing he can  do."</p>

		<p>Frasier gazed at the black tv, lost in thought.  "It's better than letting
		himself be lost over Daphne.  At least he has something to fall back on."</p>

		<p>They were quiet for awhile, and I just wanted to be gone.  It's terrible to
		feel like an intruder in your own home.  But then again, I suppose it's not
		really  my home anymore.  It hasn't really been since I announced the
		engagement.  Then Roz started talking.  "When did you finally figure out
		he's in love,  Frasier? All those years, you thought it was lust.  You did
		everything you could to stop him from telling her.  You've always been that
		way, pessimistic  about love, and if I do dare to analyze you, Doctor Crane,
		I'd say..."  She leaned back, grinning smugly.  "It's because you yourself
		have never in your  life had a relationship that wasn't based in large part
		on sex.  You laugh at me, but you're just like me, you know."  She sobered a
		bit.  "But it'll come for  you, Frasier. And it's coming for me.  I feel it.
		And it was there, right in front of Niles.  He was in love.  You stopped him
		all those years.  When did you figure it out?"</p>

		<p>He sighed and rubbed his face.  "You know, Roz, I think I've always known.
		I mean, in the beginning, it was ridiculous.  Colitis, indeed."  She looked
		at him strangely.  I myself could only giggle slightly.  "But it didn't take
		long."  He paused.  "I don't know if you remember his make-shift date with
		'Da-Phyllis,' Roz, but... I'd never seen him like that before.  And the Snow
		Ball.  He never told me what happened, and neither did she.  But whatever it
		was, Roz....  I swear, he mourned."  He looked up at her, forehead crinkled
		with worry.  "Would it make me a terrible brother if I told you I think I
		just  didn't want him to have what I knew I couldn't?"</p>

		<p>She leaned over, resting her elbows on her knees, smiled sadly, gazing at
		the carpet, and shook her head.  Then she turned her head toward him.  "It
		makes you a better brother to admit it.  By the way, Frasier, where's Daph?"</p>

		<p>"I don't know, Roz.  I never seem to know where she is anymore.  I guess
		she's doing errands.  Or maybe she's in her room.  I think she's avoiding
		me."</p>

		<p>He's right, you know.  Ever since it finally hit me... the moving out part,
		I mean... I've been feeling less and less like family and more and more...
		employee.  And I hate that feeling when it comes to these people.  But
		really... I guess I've finally realized that, no matter what, that's what I
		am.</p>

		<p>As luck would have it, at that point in their conversation, the
		ever-changing but usually bad Seattle weather began to grow quite nippy.
		And then  downright cold.  Damn balcony.  Time to make my entrance.  Damn it
		all to hell, anyway.</p>

		<p>I walked into the room purposefully.  "Hallo, Roz!  I didn't hear you come
		in!"  I think I sounded a wee bit over-anxious... or perhaps quite a bit.
		I've  never been good in uncomfortable situations.  They didn't notice,
		though, what with the speed they were jumping to opposite sides of the
		couch.</p>

		<p>Roz grinned.  She's never self-conscious about anything.  Sometimes, I wish
		I could be Roz, just for a day or so.  To have her nerve....  "So, Daph,
		what's up?"</p>

		<p>"Um... nothing!  Nothing!  Just out there admiring the Space Needle.  Did
		you know you can see the Space Needle from the balcony?  The Space  Needle!"
		Remember what I said about uncomfortable situations?  Blimey, I'm terrible.</p>

		<p>Roz just looked at me like I was insane.  I don't blame her.  "Right, Daph.
		So I was thinking.  Why don't we have a girl's night out?  We could really
		use  a good chat before the wedding."</p>

		<p>I shifted my feet, which I was staring at intently by this point.  My
		toenail polish seemed to be chipping a bit....  Time to redo that....</p>

		<p>"Daph?"</p>

		<p>"Um... well, Roz, you see, I.. um... I've got some errands to run tonight."</p>

		<p>The crazy look again.  "Errands?  Tonight?"  This time, Frasier's expression
		almost mirrored Roz's.</p>

		<p>"Um... yes.  In fact, I've got to start them now."  And with that, I
		practically ran out the door.</p>

		<h2 align="center">What Could Be Worse Than A Hidden Video Camera, Frasier?</h2>

		<p>Frasier glanced up at me, the reality of the situation just dawning on him.
		"She heard us, didn't she, Roz?  She heard about Niles."  He started
		wringing  his hands in this terrible, nervous way he has.  It started to bug
		me.  Fast.</p>

		<p>"Stop that, Frasier!"  I looked pointedly at his hands.</p>

		<p>"What?"  He glanced down.  "Oh."  Then, that little shake he has.  It's
		crazy how well I know him.  It's like we're married or something.  Scary....
		The  little worried crease was still in his brow, though.  "Seriously, Roz....  She heard.  Daphne heard."  He jumped up and started pacing.</p>

		<p>"So what if she did, Frasier?  It's not like it's something she doesn't
		know."  I probably sounded a little more relaxed than I was.  I have a knack
		for  handling tense situations.  A knack my chum Daph obviously doesn't
		share.</p>

		<p>Neither does Frasier, for that matter.  When he next spoke, he positively
		squeaked.  "What?!?!"</p>

		<p>"Well, I mean, she knows about how Niles feels.  She might not know the
		extent of... the love part... and she certainly didn't know about your part
		in the  whole fiasco, but she does know, Frasier."</p>

		<p>His voice was still an octave higher than normal.  "How?!?!  If you told
		her, Roz, I swear...."</p>

		<p>"Me?  You told her, you big lug."</p>

		<p>He huffed indignantly.  "I most certainly did nothing of the kind!"</p>

		<p>"Yes, you did Frasier.  The back medication... you were drugged up, she was
		giving you a back rub.  I confirmed it when she asked me at Christmas, but
		you told her."</p>

		<p>He slumped into, of all things, Martin's old recliner.  It didn't last long,
		though.  As soon as he realized what he had done, he was up again and
		pacing.</p>

		<p>"What did she say when she found out, Roz?"</p>

		<p>I didn't have to think long.  I remembered that party like it was yesterday.
		It was utter death.  I shiver at the recollection.</p>

		<p>"Well, at first, she was creeped out.  See, she thought he was going to tell
		her that night.  He took her out onto the balcony, and she was sure he was
		gonna do it.  She had this whole speech prepared to cut him off with,
		but..."  I paused, remembering.  "It turned out all he wanted was his
		Christmas  present back for Mel."</p>

		<p>He shook his head melodramatically, bald spot shining.  You've gotta laugh
		at the man.  No one has a right to take themselves as seriously as he does.
		It's positively funny.  I had to stifle a grin.</p>

		<p>He saw, though.  "Oh, just what is so funny, Roz?  I'm glad one of us finds
		the situation humorous!"  Indignant Frasier was back again.  He hates for
		people to laugh at his great dilemmas.</p>

		<p>"No, Frasier, it's not the situation, it's you."</p>

		<p>He huffed again.  "Well, then!!"</p>

		<p>What he hates even more is for people to laugh at him.  I giggled a bit.</p>

		<p>"Well, ignoring you for the moment, I take it Daphne was relieved at my
		brother's... surprising... request?"</p>

		<p>I shook my head, thinking.  And I don't do that often.  "That was the really
		weird part, Frasier.  She acted... almost disappointed.  You had to look
		hard  for it, of course, but if there's one person on earth I know -- other
		than your predictable self, of course -- it's Daphne.  She tried to hide it,
		but she was  upset all the same.  And she kept looking back at Niles and Mel
		the whole rest of the night.  It was positively odd.  I never mentioned
		anything, of course.  That kind of thing would always upset a girl.  I mean,
		what would I do if I woke up one morning and Noel didn't follow me around
		like a puppy?  I would be positively insulted!"</p>

		<p>He rubbed his chin with his hand and sat on the arm of Martin's chair.  "But
		Roz, are you sure that's what it was?"</p>

		<p>"I don't really know...."  I arched my eyebrows at him.  "I can always
		convince her to have that girls' night with me and can coax her into a
		little  discussion."</p>

		<p>"Oh, Roz, don't you think that might be a little bit, I don't know, obvious
		after our little overheard discussion?"</p>

		<p>I rolled my eyes at him.  "So do you want me to try or what?"</p>

		<p>He positively danced as he ushered me out, hand on my back.  "Oh, do tell me
		how it turns out!  So long, Roz!"</p>

		<p>He closed the door in my face before I had a chance to register what had
		happened.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Sometimes I Feel I've Got To</h2>

		<p>My first "errand" turned out to be a walk through the park.</p>

		<p>Some errand, I know.</p>

		<p>For quite some time, I've known that Doctor Crane had certain feelings for
		me.  You see, one day, when Doctor Crane's back went out, I overheard him
		talking about loving me.  I, of course, was horrified, so I asked Mr. Crane,
		and he said that, yes, it had been going on for years.  So when I was giving
		Doctor Crane a back rub -- and more than a wee bit nervous about it, I might
		add -- I asked him, and he said it was a misunderstanding.  But a bit later,
		when  Doctor Crane was drugged, you know, I asked him what Mr. Crane had
		meant, and he told me it was Doctor Crane who had feelings for me.</p>

		<p>You can imagine how shocked I was.</p>

		<p>And still am.</p>

		<p>But I don't know that anyone can imagine the little surge of butterflies I
		felt when I found out it was Doctor... Niles.</p>

		<p>It's bloody inconceivable, really.  I mean, I might like to think of myself
		as family, but I'm really just... the help.</p>

		<p>But it excites me.</p>

		<p>Of course, I forced myself not to think about it.</p>

		<p>Considering that it was so obviously a thing of the past.  I mean, he has
		Mel now, for God's sake.  The bitch.  "Daphne, would you get this?  Daphne,
		would you fetch that?"  I suppose what I hate most about her is that she,
		more than anyone, prompted this sudden realization -- or remembering --
		that I really am just the Crane household's housekeeper.  It's her bloody
		fault that I'm started to think this way.  I suppose it's best for everyone,
		though,  if I  remember my place.  It makes the situation with Doctor Crane
		so much simpler -- It's simply his misplaced feelings as a result of that
		wreck of a marriage.  I  should be with Donny.  It's what's right.  It's
		what's proper.</p>

		<p>But today... today.  Today, I found out the extent of Doctor Crane's former
		feelings.  Current feelings?  And it scares me.  Not so much for him, but
		for  me. I feel suddenly as if I'm making the most disastrous mistake of my
		life.  As if I've jumped and am now falling down a dark tunnel, like Alice
		down the rabbit's hole, and try as I might, I can't latch hold of even a
		damn twig to hold myself back.  At the end of the rabbit hole is marriage to
		Donny...  wondrous, certainly, but scary nonetheless, partially because all
		I can think of in relation to this metaphor is growing and shrinking
		potions, talking  caterpillars, and "Off with her head!"  At the top of the
		tunnel were the Cranes.  My old familiar life.</p>

		<p>Plus Mel.  Ick.</p>

		<p>Wasn't there a reason Alice ran away?</p>

		<p>Now I'm only succeeding in corrupting my memory of a classic British tale.
		So it goes.</p>

		<p>Would you believe, though, that I felt it?  I have an uncanny knack for
		sensing these things (although it sure bloody hell didn't do much to tell me
		he loved me those first six years).  Doctor Crane might laugh and mock when
		I say I'm a bit psychic, but if I'm not, I have bloody strong intuition.</p>

		<p>Lost in thought, I wandered to a bench in the park, still contemplating the
		situation.  The conversation I had just overheard kept running through my
		head.  "He's in love, Frasier."  "I swear, he mourned."  At what, my
		assumption that he was acting?  Now that I think about it, it makes sense.
		"I adore you.  Oh, how I've longed to hear you say that!  You're a goddess.
		I'm a new man, Daphne."  I must've hurt him so much.  And how hard could it
		have been,  really, to figure out that Phyllis was... well... me?  I'm so
		blind.  But who would've guessed?  Would you have if you were in my
		position?  What  arrogance would ever lead me to even hope that someone like
		him... the eminent Doctor Crane... would be interested in a Cockney like me?
		My mother  was thrilled to find out I had snagged a bloke of Donny's
		station, for God's sake.</p>

		<p>But at this point, as always, I guess it's best to do what Grammy Moon
		always said.  "Leave well enough alone, Daphne Moon!" she'd scold me.
		Doctor  Crane is happy with Mel.  The way he smiles at her....  She's what's
		comfortable to him, and that's important for someone like him.  It's right.
		And  Donny and I....  Well, we're right, too.  I'm satisfied.  Donny makes
		me happy.  He's a good man, and I will always love him for loving me.
		Making me  feel worthy of being loved.  I've never really felt that before,
		I don't think.</p>

		<p>That doesn't mean that I don't miss him, though.</p>

		<p>He's my best friend, as strange as it sounds with all my talk of station.
		He makes me feel comfortable.  For us to be friends is... is right.  His
		dying  feelings and my own hesitation about my own were no reason to dispel
		what we had together.  What we had was good.</p>

		<p>I glanced at my watch.  Seven o'clock already!  I resolved myself then and
		there to talk to Doctor Crane, the man who had been avoiding me for weeks.</p>

		<h2 align="center">A Midsummer Night's Dream<br/>
		or<br/>
		When Niles Met Daphne</h2>

		<p>She showed up at my door with a bottle of Jack Daniels.</p>

		<p>May I repeat that?</p>

		<p>She showed up at my door with a bottle of Jack Daniels.</p>

		<p>She looked luminous.</p>

		<p>"AH ye bisy, DO-cter Craaane?"  What can I say?  I adore her accent.</p>

		<p>"Why, no, I don't believe I am, Daphne," I replied hesitantly as I ushered
		her inside.  Not that that was much of a surprise to her based on my attire,
		a  handsome silk evening robe which covered pajamas decorated with a design
		so embarrassing I dare not record it for posterity.  I prayed she wouldn't
		notice.  A gift from... my nephew, Freddie... you know.  "As you must know,
		Mel is away at a convention."</p>

		<p>"Um... right.  Well, you see, Doctor Crane, I was thinking today about
		how... I haven't seen you in so long.  I thought we could use a night
		together  before the wedding."  She paused, and when she began again, her
		voice was soft, almost timid.  Most un-Daphne-like.  Daphne, the least timid
		person I  know. Except, perhaps, Roz.  "It's been a while, you know."</p>

		<p>I smiled, and my heart warmed.  I found myself suddenly able to think of her
		as, instead of someone I had to have, someone who I loved dearly and who,  I
		knew, loved me in friendship.  And I was satisfied.  Satisfied merely to
		know that she wanted to spend this time with me.  I am someone Daphne
		trusts.  And that thought makes me feel warm all over.  "Yes, Daphne, it has
		been a long time.  Please sit down.  Would you care for something to--"  I
		stopped  myself and grinned as I remember the whiskey.   Grinned!  Never in
		my life had I felt so relaxed around this (or any) woman.  "No, I suppose
		not.  Glasses,  then?  Food?"</p>

		<p>She smiled her dazzling smile.  "That would be perfectly lovely, Doctor
		Crane."  She paused.  "You know, there's nothing lovelier than drinking and
		remembering with an old friend."</p>

		<p>It touched me.  Deeply.  I repeated my mantra to myself.  I am someone
		Daphne trusts.  If nothing else, I am someone Daphne trusts.  "Thank you
		Daphne." I paused to collect myself and realized, then, that I was leaving
		her simply standing in front of me.  "Well, now," I rushed.  "You have a
		seat.  What to eat?"</p>

		<p>"Well, I don't know, Doctor Crane.  What do you have?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, a bit of everything, I suspect," I replied lightly.  "The refrigerator
		is well-stocked thanks to Mel."</p>

		<p>She smiled tightly.  "Yes, I can imagine.  Does she binge on celery as
		well?"  It was harsh, yes, but I wasn't insulted as I used to be when
		Frasier would  say something horrid about Maris.  She looked uncomfortable,
		though, and apologized.  "I'm sorry, Doctor Crane.  That was wrong of me."</p>

		<p>I merely smiled and took the punch.  "No, quite all right, Daphne.  But, to
		correct, when Mel binges, she also eats carrots."  That won me a smile.
		"How's  this.  I'll get the glasses and pour our drinks, and you dig out
		whatever you want in the kitchen."</p>

		<p>"Smashing."</p>

		<p>Sure enough, there was celery in the bottom drawer.</p>

		<p>I don't think so.</p>

		<p>Finally, after much scrounging, I found a couple bags of Pepperidge Farm
		cookie in the cupboard.  I knew they weren't Mel's.  Probably the remnants
		of  a little "casual" get together she had thrown here, though.  I didn't
		know why it should make me uncomfortable that she was already throwing her
		parties  here  or why it should make me happy that I'd found perhaps the one
		item in the kitchen Mel herself wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole, but it
		did.  Mint  Milano,  Geneva, and Brussels.  My favorites.</p>

		<p>I brought out the bags and a couple of plates.  "Alcohol and Pepperidge
		Farm."  I said slyly.  "A winning combination if I ever heard one."</p>

		<p>"Without a doubt!" he intoned, having splayed himself across the fainting
		couch.  He raised his glass, and I did the same as I lowered myself to the
		floor,  back resting snugly against the couch.</p>

		<p>"What shall we drink to, Doctor Crane?"</p>

		<p>"To friends," he said, then paused.  "To friends who have been needlessly
		separated for too long."</p>

		<p>I smiled and nodded, and our glasses touched.</p>

		<p>After three glasses, the whiskey still scorched my throat like fire.  As it
		loosened my tongue.</p>

		<p>So I ate another cookie.  A Mint Milano, to be precise.  I'd had about ten
		of each kind.</p>

		<p>"No, no, Daphne.  I'm serious.  I'd like to know, no matter how --"  I took
		another shot-sized gulp and shook my head as my forehead wrinkled.  "--how
		horrid it might have been.  What was your first impression?"</p>

		<p>"All righty, then, if you insist."  She paused for effect.  "I thought he
		was pompous, vain, and rude.  Not that I don't love him dearly, mind you."</p>

		<p>I grinned.  "Well, what do you know!  That was my first impression of him,
		too!"</p>

		<p>She smiled.  "But I found Mr. Crane positively delightful, which is why I
		decided to stay on.  I wouldn't have been working for him if it had been up
		to  your brother, anyway."</p>

		<p>"But surely he recognized you as the most competent in your field!"  I was
		astonished.</p>

		<p>"Oh, come now, Doctor Crane.  'In my field.'  You make me sound like a
		scholar of something.  And I'm sure I wasn't the most competent at all.  And
		I'm especially certain that I scared the living daylights out of him with my
		talk of psychic flashes."  She smiled.  I love that she can laugh at
		herself.  I think that's always been Frasier's biggest shortcoming.  "But your dear father liked me.  And I liked him.  And that was really what was most important, after  all."</p>

		<p>"And I'm so glad for it."  Probably shouldn't have said it.  Just like I
		probably shouldn't have said what I said next.  "And what about me, Daphne?
		You  thought Frasier was arrogant, you thought Dad was delightful....  What
		about me?"</p>

		<p>The looked she gave me was completely sincere.  Beautiful.  "You were
		charming, Doctor Crane."</p>

		<p>I shook my head in disagreement.  "I most certainly was not.  If I recall my
		first words to you --"</p>

		<p>She cut me off to do an imitation.  "Ahem.  'You're Daphne?!  When Frasier
		told me he had hired an Englishwoman, I imagined someone... someone....
		You're Daphne?!?'  Those, Doctor Crane, were your first words to me."</p>

		<p>I shook my head in embarrassment.  "This only proves my point!"  I laughed.
		"How on earth could that ever be construed as charming?"</p>

		<p>She smiled the sincere smile again.  The one that makes me melt.  "I was
		totally and completely flattered.  You didn't intend to flatter me.  It was
		totally  unintentional, in fact.  But it was there.  And that's charming."</p>

		<p>"Then I'd like to think that my every word to you is charming, Daphne."</p>

		<p>"I've figured that out, now.  Yes."</p>

		<p>I looked up a bit too sharply, having no clue what she meant by that comment
		but suspecting the worst.  Figured what out, exactly?  But I didn't say a
		word. "I suppose, then, you don't need to be told my first impression of
		you."</p>

		<p>She shook her head.  "I have a rough idea, I suppose, but I really don't
		know what your impression of me is at all.  How do you see me, Doctor
		Crane?"</p>

		<p>The thought of answering her saddened me a bit, so my answer held a mournful
		tone.  "'She had wit, she had grace, she had beauty; but above all, she had truth.'  I find you enchanting, Daphne."</p>

		<p>Her blush was apparent, although she bowed her head.  "Thank you, Doctor
		Crane."</p>

		<p>"Daphne --"  I spoke suddenly.  I've always wondered, really.  "Why do you
		call me that?  I asked you so many times... in the beginning....  So why do
		you not call me Niles?"</p>

		<p>She looked down but didn't have to think twice.  "Boundaries."</p>

		<p>I was taken aback.  "What?  What do you mean?"</p>

		<p>I looked up at him, laid my head back onto the fainting couch so that it was
		just beside his left knee.  "You were my employer's brother.  There were
		boundaries.  There still are."</p>

		<p>He shook his head, finished off his fourth glass, went to pour us both
		another, and realized the bottle was empty.  He stood and walked to the  wet
		bar.  "Scotch all right?"  I nodded, and he grabbed the whole bottle and
		brought it back to where I sat.  Instead of perching himself on the fainting
		couch again, though, he sat beside me.  "Daphne, you can't possibly think
		that's all you are --"</p>

		<p>I laughed nervously, a wee bit self-conscious.  Tense situations and all
		that.  "No, of course not.  I know I mean more to you three than that.  But
		it's still  there."  How to explain my perception of station to a man who
		sees it in everyone, everything except our relationship?  I struggled with a
		way to put it.  "And  you know it just as well as I do.  You know that there
		are certain people your brother doesn't invite to his snooty parties.  Like
		at Christmas, when he  didn't  bring anyone from the station.  Imagine it
		this way.  Let's say life is one of your brother's little parties.  You're
		one of the guests.  I serve the drinks."</p>

		<p>He swung around sharply to face me and grasped my shoulders in his hands.
		"No, Daphne.  You're so much more than that.  You're everyth --"</p>

		<p>"And then there's that, too.  There had to be boundaries between us.  There
		just had to be."</p>

		<p>I think he realized what I was trying to say almost before I did, for he
		loosened his grip and looked away from me, shoulders hunched slightly.  "But
		now  there's Donny.  And Mel.  Isn't that boundary enough?  Can't you call
		me Niles?"</p>

		<p>As good as an admission.  I swallowed most of my glass of scotch.</p>

		<p>"You do have a point.  I suppose I can... Niles."  I smiled slightly.
		"Niles.  You know, I've started to think of you more as Niles recently."
		Why did I  just admit that?</p>

		<p>"Really?  Then it shouldn't be hard.  I like it when you say my name.  We're
		friends.  Friends should be comfortable enough with each other for at least
		that."</p>

		<p>I looked up at him.  "You're my best friend, you know.  If comfort is a
		measure of the... strength of a friendship.  Then you're my best friend."</p>

		<p>He smiled a radiant smile and looked down.  "Well, Daphne, you're mine, as
		well."</p>

		<p>I glanced down at the remnants of my scotch.  I hate scotch.  "What would
		you say to some daiquiris, Niles?  Or a pina colada?  Something tasty?"  I
		stood slowly, wobbling slightly.</p>

		<p>He pulled me back down.  "I think perhaps we've both had enough alcohol,
		Daphne.  I'd hate to think that I might say something terrible and
		inappropriate."</p>

		<p>Blame it on the alcohol.  Blame it on the closeness.  Blame it on the smell
		of his aftershave.  He still had his arms around me, and he was looking into
		my  eyes.  "How long have you loved me, Niles?"</p>

		<p>To his credit, he didn't look half as shocked as I felt.  "My whole life,
		Daphne.  I've loved you my whole life."  His answer was calm, his grip on me
		remained firm.  But for some reason, I knew this would go nowhere.  We could
		talk about anything we wanted to tonight with absolute ease, and it would
		remain just that.  Talk.  Not a future.  Something about the air, perhaps.</p>

		<p>I leaned into him, my head on his shoulder.</p>

		<p>"Me too."  Did I just say that?</p>

		<p>"I didn't know that."  Apparently so.  "Why've you never said anything?"</p>

		<p>"I just now realized.  Why've you never said anything?"</p>

		<p>"Because I never seem to realize that the right time has come until it's
		gone."</p>

		<p>I sighed, and he held me more tightly to him.  Immensely protective.  Our
		drunken stupor was... gorgeous.</p>

		<p>"You told me once, though.  I just didn't believe you."</p>

		<p>Now it was his turn to sigh as he reached his hand up to stroke my hair.
		"I've told you several times.  But no, you never do."  He paused.  "I adore
		you."</p>

		<p>"I believe you, now.  Would you believe me?"  I was crying now, just
		slightly.  So much too late.  We both knew it was too late.  Which I suppose
		was  why we could say it at all.</p>

		<p>"I think I just might, you know.  Not that I believe I deserve it at all."
		He sighed.  "Why now, Daphne?  Why do you believe me now if you didn't then?
		And why do you... feel this way now if you didn't then?"  I suppose he
		didn't dare say I love him.</p>

		<p>I rose slightly, indignantly.  "Maybe I did then."  I settled back in
		resignation.  "I just didn't know."</p>

		<p>"Why?"</p>

		<p>"Because it wasn't right.  You and me....  How could I possibly believe
		you'd feel that way about someone like me?  I'm nothing special, you know.
		Strangely, to you, I guess I am....   But even that... is it real or
		circumstance?  Everyone thinks they love what they can't have.  The
		forbidden fruit, you  know."</p>

		<p>"That wasn't it, Daphne.  I can't even explain it.  You're....  I can't
		possibly explain what you mean to me."</p>

		<p>"You're lovely," she whispered as she kissed my cheek.</p>

		<p>It was surreal.</p>

		<p>How could I possibly be having this conversation?</p>

		<p>Possibly because of my newly found resolve that this would never go
		anywhere.  We could say anything we wanted.  It would never become more.</p>

		<p>"It's better that it's like this," she whispered.  "It's better to know but
		never to act.  Leaving it unknown... never tarnished.  If we don't touch it,
		we'll  never tarnish what we have now.  You know what Flaubert said --"</p>

		<p>She'd read my mind, and we spoke the line softly together.  "We must not
		touch our idols, for inevitably the gilt will come off on our fingers...."</p>

		<p>The most surreal night of my life.</p>

		<p>She coughed slightly into my shoulder.  "You know, when Doctor Crane told me
		--"  Frasier.  I should have known.  "-- that was what I was scared of.
		Because it doesn't matter how you think of me.  It's when we're faced with
		the reality that everything's always ruined."  She stopped for a moment.
		"Why do you love me, Niles?  Tell me."</p>

		<p>I sighed.  "I love your eyes.  So beautiful... they bore into my soul.  I
		love the way you look at me.  I love the way you smile.  You light up the
		world  with a  single grin.  I love your smell.  You say it's Obsession...."
		I paused to linger in the humor of her old double entendre.  "But it's you,
		Daphne.  It's very  raw  and natural.  You're very natural.  I love that.
		You've got not pretenses.  You need none.  I love the way you laugh.  Like
		bells on Christmas.  Your voice  is  running water, a trickling stream, and
		your laughs are the laughter of the brook as it goes over the rocks.  And
		your accent...."  I smiled a bit  self-consciously.  "I positively adore
		your accent."  Here I pause.  "You're exquisitely beautiful, but your soul's
		beautiful, too, Daphne.  You love..."  I  stopped, trying to think of
		something else to say, but in the end, nothing came.  "You love, Daphne."
		It seemed an appropriate ending.</p>

		<p>She was crying.  I could tell.  She didn't move, and my shirt wasn't wet,
		but I could feel it deep inside.  "Thank you," she barely whispered.  "No
		one's  ever....  Thank you."  I was horrified that no one had ever said
		these things to this amazing woman.  But...</p>

		<p>"What about you, Daphne?  Why?"</p>

		<p>She sighed.  "You love me like I've never before dreamed of being loved.
		For that.  And for your smiles.  I always know the world is as it should be
		when you shoot me one of those charming grins of yours."  She smiled up at
		me.  "Your patience.  Your persistence.  Your drive.  Your confidence and
		your insecurities.  Your dependence when you so want to be independent.
		Your kindness.  So... wonderful.  The way you make me feel."  She sighed.
		"I'm not much with words."</p>

		<p>"You're perfect."  I stopped to let that resound.  She needed to know.
		"I've been thinking... that this whole conversation is utterly surreal.  So
		I suppose  it's impossible to ruin anything when everything is still... the
		illusion.  We can only become closer."  I held her more tightly.  "We
		could...."  I paused.  I  didn't want to alter the carefully constructed
		balance at hand, and I feared I might.  "We could have this night, Daphne.
		Have one night of pure beauty that  can never tarnish."</p>

		<p>She looked up at me, her alcohol-hazed eyes boring into mine.  "Our perfect
		night."</p>

		<p>I stood slowly and pulled her up after me.  My goddess.  How extraordinary.</p>

		<p>I led her up the stairs.</p>

		<p>Afterward, she told me she loved me for the first time.</p>

		<p>In the morning, she was gone.</p>

		<p>As she had to be.</p>

		<p>But it was a night of beauty.  The most magnificent night of my life.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Another Sick Day?</h2>

		<p>She came in at dawn.  She glowed.</p>

		<p>I lay on my ridiculously expensive couch under Egyptian cotton sheets, and I
		was sweltering.  My room had been stifling, and now, here, with the air
		conditioning on and a glass of ice water beside me, I was still burning up.</p>

		<p>Whether I was truly sick or this was a psychosomatic illness, I, the
		psychiatrist, had no idea.</p>

		<p>The long and short of it, though, was that I was awake when she came in,
		drenched from the rain, but glowing nonetheless.</p>

		<p>I knew she hadn't been at Roz's.  Roz never found her last night.</p>

		<p>Which means that she was either at Donny's or at my brother's.</p>

		<p>I prayed for the prior, because I didn't think my brother's heart could
		handle the rejection of her leaving him at dawn.</p>

		<p>And then I remembered Donny's business trip to California.</p>

		<p>"Daphne."</p>

		<p>She looked back at me, surprised.  "Doctor Crane!  Why are you out here?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, I, um, think I'm developing a bit of a cold.  I'm terribly hot.  It's
		not important.  Did you have a good night?"</p>

		<p>I don't know how she construed my question.  For once in my life, though, I
		managed to ask a question utterly devoid of sarcasm.  She didn't seem
		offended.  "It was perfect," she responded, before closing her door behind
		her.</p>

		<p>I closed my eyes and tried to sleep.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Ah, Good My Lords, What A Nose Is His</h2>

		<p>I've always fancied myself a sort of Cyrano de Bergerac -- utterly in love
		but entirely unworthy of my love.  If my life had been a play, I would have
		been  Cyrano, and Daphne would have been the divine Roxane -- "All
		unsuspicious -- full of charms unconscious, like a sweet perfumed rose -- a
		snare of  nature, within whose petals Cupid lurks in ambush!  He who has
		seen her smile has known perfection, --Instilling into trifles grace's
		essence, divinity in  every careless gesture; not Venus' self can mount her
		conch blown sea-ward, as she can step into her chaise a porteurs, nor Dian
		fleet across the woods  spring-flowered, light as my Lady o'er the stones of
		Paris!. . ."</p>

		<p>I suppose I dressed up at that Halloween party as Cyrano for her.  Ironic
		that as Cyrano I did tell her -- rather asked her to marry me -- but as
		Niles, I never could.</p>

		<p>Who would have been Christian?  Donny, I suppose.  Bumbling but, in image,
		what she wanted.</p>

		<p>But, oh, I could have wooed her as Cyrano.  Enchanted her with words about
		herself and her beauty.  I remembered an ill-fated discussion on Frasier's
		couch.  "She has a smile that makes my knees go weak."</p>

		<p>Always for someone else, though.  I could never speak directly to her.</p>

		<p>Until last night.</p>

		<p>But then again, I suppose it was just Cyrano all over again.  Dying, I
		whisper to her my love.  "I feel my soul heavy with love untold.  I die!  No
		more, as  in days of old, my loving, longing eyes will feast on your least
		gesture -- ay, the least!  I mind me the way you touch your cheek with your
		finger, softly,  as you speak!  Ah me!  I know that gesture well!  My heart
		cries out! -- I cry 'Farewell'!...  My life, my love, my jewel, my sweet, my
		heart has been  yours  in every beat!"</p>

		<p>And Daphne loved me, too.</p>

		<p>But now, we were both dying.</p>

		<p>I never before thought I'd reach a point at which I was satisfied not to
		have her.</p>

		<p>One perfect night in which I loved her and she loved me.  And nothing was
		tarnished.  It's still perfect, and it always will be.</p>

		<p>I loved her then more than I ever had, but I was satisfied.  She couldn't
		give me more than she already had.  I suppose she was right in that.  This
		is what  there could be, and I was happy, joyous, with anything she could
		give me.</p>

		<p>I got dressed to pick Mel up at the airport.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Cafe Nervosa, Where Everybody Knows Your Name</h2>

		<p>At some ungodly hour in the morning, Frasier called me.</p>

		<p>"Daphne was out all night!"  She whispered harshly between sniffles.  "She
		was with Niles.  I just know it."</p>

		<p>At that moment, it was fine that he called me at four fifty or five forty or
		whatever insane hour it was.</p>

		<p>Now, though, as I watched Niles walk into Cafe Nervosa arm in arm with The
		Bitch, as I like to refer to her, my forgiveness wore thin.</p>

		<p>"So Frasier," I whispered, intentionally louder than necessary.  "If he was
		with Daph, how do you explain that?"  I hope I embarrassed all three of
		them,  although if the two in the doorway heard me, they didn't show it.</p>

		<p>Frasier did a double take.  "But I was sure!"</p>

		<p>So I did the only thing I could think of.  "Niles!"  Just my luck.  The
		Bitch was following.</p>

		<p>I suppose she's really not that bad.  She's not mine, so I don't know why I
		complain.</p>

		<p>"Good morning, Roz!"  I studied him carefully.  Something was different.  He
		was happier than I had ever seen him before.</p>

		<p>"Niles, can I have... a word with you?"  I looked at him meaningfully.
		Behind him, Frasier was making insane gestures.  "No!  No!  No!"  I could
		just  see him screaming on the inside.  Take this, sleep-stealer.</p>

		<p>"But of course, Roz."  He glanced at Mel.  "I'll be right back, darling.
		Can you talk to Frasier for a bit?"</p>

		<p>She grinned that maniacal grin of hers.  "Of course!  Frasier and I could
		talk for hours!"  He grimaced.  I laughed.  Niles glared at us both but
		nodded and  kissed Mel's cheek.</p>

		<p>I wanted to vomit.</p>

		<p>We made our way to a corner table.  It was strange, really.  I don't think
		I've ever even seen the corner tables at Cafe Nervosa.  Frasier and I always
		tend  to sit dead center.  But this conversation had to be private.  As soon
		as we sat down, I cut to the chase.</p>

		<p>"Where's Daphne?"</p>

		<p>He seemed a bit taken aback.  "What?  At home, I guess."</p>

		<p>"And whose home would that be, Niles?  Your home?  My home?  Frasier's home?
		Donny's home?"  I threw the last one in to tick him off.  Didn't even
		ruffle his feathers.</p>

		<p>He huffed.  "Well, her home, I'd suspect."</p>

		<p>"Which is?"  I felt bad for Daphne, really.  She's never really had anywhere
		to call her own, unless you count that study.  I guess that's what my
		question  to Niles really was.  What does Daphne have?</p>

		<p>"Well....  Frasier's, I'd assume."</p>

		<p>"Why isn't she with you, Niles?"</p>

		<p>He still wasn't bothered.  "Why would she be with me?"</p>

		<p>I shook my head.  "You know, Niles, when I spend a passionate night with a
		man, I usually hope that he'll at least want to spend the next day with me,
		whether I do or not."  Ick.  That didn't quite come out right.  Or maybe it
		did come out right, and that's the problem.</p>

		<p>I can only describe his reaction to the last question as completely torn.
		He looked like his best friend had just punched him in the nose for no
		reason.  Which, really, I suppose, is how he took it.  "Daphne... told you?"</p>

		<p>I covered quickly.  No need to make things worse between them.  This was
		obviously something they considered their little secret.  Yea, right.  "No,
		Niles, of course Daphne didn't tell me.  Frasier was awake when she came in
		this morning.  He asked her how her night was, and she said something  about
		it being perfect.  We just assumed...."</p>

		<p>He had regained his cool and was glaring at a spot just above my shoulder.
		"You shouldn't assume things like that, Roz.  It'll only get you into
		trouble."</p>

		<p>"Whatever Niles.  I'm serious.  Why aren't you with her?  Isn't she going to
		call off the wedding?"</p>

		<p>He looked straight into my eyes.  "She isn't.  I've really got things to do,
		if you don't mind."</p>

		<p>He began to stand, but I grabbed his hand.  "What?  Niles, I don't
		understand."</p>

		<p>He looked at me with something resembling pity.  "You wouldn't, Roz.  This
		is about love."</p>

		<p>And he walked away.</p>

		<p>I don't think I've ever hurt more.</p>

		<p>So I did the only thing I knew to do.</p>

		<p>I got up, brushed past them all (including bitchy Mel, smiling like a
		lunatic) without saying a word, and went to find Daphne.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Down In The Park</h2>

		<p>She found me in the park.  I guess I'm pretty predictable.  When I'm upset,
		I can usually be found walking Eddie.  Of course, today I didn't have the
		excuse of walking Eddie.  He was with Mr. Crane somewhere, I suspected.  I
		suppose it's one of the few things I can do to get me away from the house.
		And I needed to be away from the house.</p>

		<p>I could hear her coming, so when she was a few feet behind me, I spoke up.
		"Hi, Roz."</p>

		<p>She sighed and slumped down beside me on the bench where I sat.  "Hi,
		Daphne."  She paused.  "Daphne, I know what happened."</p>

		<p>My head shot up.  This I didn't expect.  "He told you?"</p>

		<p>She shook her head and rolled her eyes.  "No, of course he didn't tell me.
		I asked him about it earlier, and he wouldn't even mention it.  He treats it
		like a  sacred act that mentioning would defile or something."  She sighed.
		"No, Daph.  I know you.  It wasn't hard to figure out."  She grinned.  "And
		Frasier  called me this morning when you came in."</p>

		<p>I didn't know what to say.  "Oh."</p>

		<p>She accepted that, though, and shook her head, seeming puzzled.  "Why aren't
		you with him, Daph?  Why are you here alone when you could be with  him?"</p>

		<p>I stood up suddenly, shaking my head emphatically.  "Don't you see, Roz?  I
		couldn't be with him!  I've really got no bloody choice in the matter.  I
		love  him, and he loves me, and we had our one perfect night.  But we can't
		have more.  This is how it's supposed to work."</p>

		<p>She glared at me and stood up to face me.  "So what are you saying?  You're
		basing this insane decision on... what... your visions?"  To call her tone
		mocking would have been an understatement.  It was like a slap in the face.</p>

		<p>"No, Roz, that's not what I'm saying at all.  I'm saying that for us to be
		together isn't what's right.  He belongs with someone like Mel, just like he
		belonged with someone like Mrs. Crane.  I belong with someone like Donny,
		and I always have.  What we had..."  I sighed a bit too wistfully.  "It was
		like a beautiful anomaly."  My tone sharpened.  "But to make it into more
		than it was would ruin it.  We can't tarnish what we have."</p>

		<p>She put her hands on her hips and nodded sarcastically, if one can nod
		sarcastically.  "Okay, I see.  So what you're saying is that what you had
		was so  perfect that you aren't willing to risk trying?  You're giving up to
		avoid pain in the long run?  Daphne, every relationship has its share of
		heartache, but that doesn't make it any less beautiful.  So now you're
		dooming him to life with Mel and you to life with Donny.  You're selling you
		both short!  Why make  him be with someone he's not happy with because it
		seems in your warped mind more proper or something?  Love happens in weird
		places, Daph.  Very  seldom is it as it should be."</p>

		<p>I shook my head again.  She just didn't understand.  Or maybe she did, and
		that was what scared me.  Maybe she was right.  "No, Roz.  We've done the
		right thing.  I'm sorry if you don't think so."  And I walked away.</p>

		<p>She didn't try to follow me.  She did yell at my back, though, and I
		stopped, back still turned, to listen.</p>

		<p>"You're making the biggest mistake of your life, Daph.  I've always looked
		up to you.  You were the one who managed to have meaningful, lasting
		relationships, and I could never manage it.  But if you want to know the
		truth, I think I understand a hell of a lot that you never could.  I know
		how to  appreciate what I have.  You throw your chances away and hurt
		everyone in your path."</p>

		<p>I turned around to face her.  "If you know so much, Roz, if you have this
		amazing ability to appreciate and take advantage of what you have, then why
		in  bloody hell aren't you with Frasier?"</p>

		<p>I turned and walked away.</p>

		<p>That was the last time I saw her until the day of my wedding.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Yea, Right</h2>

		<p>I frowned when I heard what Daphne said.</p>

		<p>Roz with me?</p>

		<p>You see, at Cafe Nervosa, Roz and my brother shared heated words at a corner
		table.  She stormed out, not glancing at us.  I glared at my brother.</p>

		<p>"Niles, what did you say?"</p>

		<p>He raised his chin slightly in defiance and wrapped his arm around Mel's
		waist.  "Only what's true."</p>

		<p>I shook my head.  "If you hurt her, Niles -- either of them...."  I glared
		at him again and left.</p>

		<p>To follow my producer and closest friend, other than my brother, who might
		soon find himself disowned.</p>

		<p>I followed her to the park, where I was shocked to learn that the split
		between Daphne and my brother had been as much her doing as his.  I'd only
		assumed -- because of his attitude with Mel....</p>

		<p>And then Daphne walked away with one final question to Roz: "Why aren't you
		with Frasier?"</p>

		<p>Of course, her language was a good deal more British and colorful.</p>

		<p>I approached Roz silently.  Her back had been turned to me during their
		fight, but soon after Daphne left, she turned back toward me.</p>

		<p>And almost ran into my chest.</p>

		<p>"Watch where you're going, Roz.  The last thing I need is...."  My voice
		drifted off, though, as my smart remark got lost somewhere in my mind.  "How
		are you?"</p>

		<p>She shook her head and fell onto the bench she and Daphne had been sitting
		on.  Her head fell into her hands as she leaned forward, her hair falling
		around her face.  "I just don't know, Frasier.  I've just had two of the most
		painful encounters of my life.  First Niles tells me --"  She shuddered and
		stopped,  and I sat down beside her and draped my arm around her shoulders
		snugly.</p>

		<p>"What did he say to you?"</p>

		<p>She sighed.  "I told him that I didn't understand his attitude about last
		night.  And he told me --"  She gulped then, as if she was holding back
		tears.  "He  told me there was no way I could understand.  Because it was
		about love."</p>

		<p>Suddenly, I understood.  As a psychiatrist, I know that Roz has always had a
		fear of emotional intimacy.  She's afraid of commitment.  But we never
		spoke of it.  We laugh about her preoccupation with sex, but it covers
		something more deeply buried.  And Niles had used his insight into her
		against her  horribly.  Whatever happened the oath?  "First do no harm."</p>

		<p>I wrapped my other arm around her and held her tightly to me as she cried.
		I don't think I've ever seen Roz cry.  Not like this.  "He's wrong, honey.
		You know he's wrong.  You know what it is to love.  What you just tried to
		do for Daphne -- that was love."  I sighed.  "He lashed out.  I suspect he's
		in  denial about what last night really meant to him, and he took it out on
		you.  Just always remember, Roz, that he's wrong.  You love more deeply than
		anyone I've ever met."  I didn't know what else to say.  So I stopped.</p>

		<p>Slowly, she stopped crying.  "Thanks, Frasier."  She smiled up at me through
		her tears.  Her mascara was running down her face, her nose was running a
		bit, and her face was blotchy, but her was were shining brightly.  She
		looked a little bit like she had the morning Alice was born.  She looked
		lovely.  What had I said to her?  That I'd never seen anyone look more
		completely happy.  Right now, amazingly, she looked happy.</p>

		<p>I took out my handkerchief and wiped her face off while she watched me.
		When her face was free of mascara and tears, I smiled and pulled her up.
		"C'mon, honey.  Let's go back to Cafe Nervosa and have a coffee.  By now,
		Niles and Mel are probably long gone."</p>

		<p>She nodded, and we walked out of the park, my arm still draped around her
		shoulders.</p>

		<p>We wouldn't talk about what Daphne had said today.  In fact, we probably
		wouldn't talk about it for a long time.  We're like that.</p>

		<p>But now, it's there between us, and we both know it.</p>

		<p>It can only make us stronger.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Going Up, Staying Down</h2>

		<p>I sighed as I walked into the Elliot Bay Towers.  I was about to step into
		the elevator when I heard someone call out behind me.  "Daph!  Wait up!"</p>

		<p>I turned around to see Mr. Crane hobbling up to join me in the elevator,
		Eddie in tow behind him.</p>

		<p>"How are you, Daph?  I feel like I never see you anymore."  He smiled
		ruefully and shook his white head as the doors of the elevator closed behind
		us.  "But I guess I'll have to get used to it, right?"</p>

		<p>I smiled and leaned down to kiss him on the cheek.  I think I shocked him
		and bit.  "Have I told you that I'm going to miss you, you old sod?"</p>

		<p>He smiled as the elevator doors opened in front of apartment 1901 and Eddie
		rushed out.  "We'll miss you, too, Daphne."</p>

		<p>We.  I felt like crying.  "I just stopped in to get a few things.  I'm going
		to stay over with Donny tonight.  We have some things to sort out before the
		wedding."</p>

		<p>He looked at me curiously as we stepped into the apartment.  "I thought
		Donny was out of town until next week?  Didn't he have to make a business
		trip to California?"</p>

		<p>How to cover this one?  "Oh.  He did.  But he got back early, so I'm
		spending some time with him."</p>

		<p>Mr. Crane nodded and took his usual seat in his old, green, striped recliner
		as Eddie perched himself on the arm of the chair.  "All right, Daph.
		Whatever  you say.  You two kids have a good time.  Say, is that where you
		were last night?"</p>

		<p>I paused on my hurried way to the study -- my room -- and glanced back.
		"Why, yes.  Yes, I was with him."</p>

		<p>Mr. Crane raised his eyebrows at me but didn't say anything.</p>

		<p>As I collected some clothes and toiletries -- all that I would need for my
		next few lonely nights at Donny's empty apartment -- I wondered if Mr. Crane
		knew more than he was letting on.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Le Freres Heureux</h2>

		<p>"I just don't know what to do, Doctor Crane.  We've never fought like this
		before.  I mean, she's my sister, and there's always been a little sibling
		rivalry, but she's still my best friend.  And now, you know, now it's...
		it's....  I just don't know what to do, Doctor Crane.  I thought living
		closer together  would only bring us together."</p>

		<p>Frasier sighed in the next booth, like he was in pain.  We hadn't seen Niles
		in days -- or Daphne, for that matter -- and judging from Frasier's
		attitude, this  was a question he wanted to answer with one of his personal
		anecdotes.  But he was still angry with Niles.  Furious, in fact.  On my
		behalf.</p>

		<p>"Nancy, if I may, I'll answer that question with a story of my own."  He'd
		broken down.  I knew he would.  "As many of my listeners know, I moved  back
		home to the Seattle area almost eight years ago from Boston.  My brother had
		a thriving practice here already.  We've always been rivals --  I went to
		Harvard, he went to Yale.  I went to Oxford, he to Cambridge.  As children,
		we rivaled for our mother's attention.  We fought over test scores.  We even
		chose the same profession -- to be set once again as rivals?  Perhaps."  He
		paused.  "And, at times, we do horrid things to each other, whether we mean
		them or not."</p>

		<p>He paused for a moment, and I knew where the story was headed.  "It got to
		the extreme that... when I saw that my brother was in love, and had been for
		years, I did everything I could to prevent him from taking action....
		Merely because I didn't want him to have what I thought I couldn't.  And,
		perhaps  partly in retaliation, although Niles doesn't know my newly
		discovered subconscious motives, he recently said some terrible, hurtful
		things to the most  important woman in my life.  Even in this, we're
		fighting."</p>

		<p>He sighed and buried his head in his hands.  I could only smile supportively
		at him.  "Nevertheless, he's my brother, and I love him.  He's --"  He
		glanced at me.  "-- one of the best friends I've ever had.</p>

		<p>"Nancy, there will always be fights.  There will always be rivalry.  And
		living so close to your sister will increase the negative aspects of your
		relationship.  But it will also magnify the positive aspects.  When I lived
		in Boston, I had almost lost touch with my brother.  When I moved back here,
		it  took us some time to reestablish our relationship -- which may be the
		phase you're going through -- but the good times with my brother -- the
		squash  matches, the parties, the heart to heart discussions over a
		beautiful, rare filet mignon or a decaf latte, even the rough patches,
		even... just being able to look out for my baby brother -- make all the our
		struggles and turmoil worthwhile.  I feel like I know my brother again, and
		that is vitally important to me.  I  have a feeling, Nancy, that before
		long, your relationship will be back on track.  And there will still be
		fights -- but you must learn to appreciate even the  fights.  Simply work to
		appreciate your sister's presence.  It's hard for her, too.  She may feel at
		this early stage that you're encroaching on her territory.  Just let her
		know, Nancy, every second how much you value your relationship."</p>

		<p>He stopped and raised his head, waiting a bit.  There were some sniffles on
		the line, but no Nancy.  "Nancy?"</p>

		<p>More sniffles.  "Yes, D-D-Doctor Cr-Crane?  Oh, that was touching."  Frasier
		certainly has a way.  He'd made poor Nancy cry.</p>

		<p>"But did it help you, Nancy?"  He sounded a bit desperate.  I think, right
		now, he needed to feel that his story had helped someone, even if he felt
		his  relationship with Niles was currently in tatters.</p>

		<p>"Oh, yes, Doctor Crane!  In fact, I think I'm going to take Samantha to
		dinner tonight.  Maybe what we really need is  good talk to... help us get
		reacquainted after all this time apart.  Does that sound right?"</p>

		<p>He smiled.  "It sounds perfect, Nancy.  And I know you'll be fine."</p>

		<p>"You, too, Doctor Crane.  Thank you."</p>

		<p>"All right."  I made a motion for him to wrap up.  "It looks as though our
		time is up.  Goodbye, Seattle.  This is Doctor Frasier Crane, wishing you
		good  mental health."</p>

		<p>He pushed a button to send the station to a commercial break and removed the
		headphones.  He looked up toward me, and I spoke into the microphone at
		him.  "Looks like your show's becoming more widely received, Frasier.  Look
		who's behind you."  He turned, then, and saw who I had seen five  minutes
		ago standing at the glass door -- Niles.  Frasier got up slowly and opened
		the door.</p>

		<p>"What is it, Niles?"</p>

		<p>His brother took a deep breath.  "Frasier, last time I checked my calendar,
		it was my turn to go first."  He stopped and took a deep breath.  "I'm
		sorry,  Frasier."</p>

		<p>Frasier smiled.  Not his cheap cheesy grin, but I real, sincere smile.
		"Thank you, Niles."  They hugged briefly, and then Niles stepped past
		Frasier and  came into my booth.</p>

		<p>Frasier watched us from where he stood.</p>

		<p>"Roz --"</p>

		<p>I shook my head.  "Niles, you don't have to say anything.  It was none of my
		business."</p>

		<p>He shook his head.  "No, Roz, it was your business.  Daphne's your friend,
		and you were worried about her.  I don't blame you for that.  It just proves
		how wrong I was in what I said."  He looked down at his feet. "I never
		thought I'd say this to you, Roz Doyle, but I was terribly wrong, and I'm
		very  sorry."</p>

		<p>I smiled at him and gave him a small hug, at which he just stepped back and
		gaped at me.  I laughed.  "Okay, okay, no more of this mushy stuff.  You're
		forgiven.  Go talk to your brother."</p>

		<p>He nodded and was just turning to leave when he thought of something.  "Roz,
		how is Daphne?"</p>

		<p>I shrugged.  "I'm really not sure.  We had a big fight the other day and
		both said some regrettable -- if true -- things.  I haven't seen her since.
		She's  avoiding me, I think, but then again -- I'm avoiding her, too.  But
		Martin says she's been spending her nights with Donny and only coming by for
		his  exercises.  Frasier and Martin are sort of having to make do where
		other areas are concerned."  I grinned.  "And you can imagine how tough a
		step this is  for Frasier.  He was only just learning to open the door for
		himself."</p>

		<p>Niles smiled at my last comment but still looked a little puzzled.  "But --
		never mind."</p>

		<p>Frasier, who had wandered over toward my booth and was now leaning, arms
		crossed in front of him, against the doorway, smiled at his brother.
		"Niles, what do you say to dinner tonight?  I'm sure we could squeeze our way into that fabulous new bistro on Fremont...."  He raised his eyebrows alluringly. I never knew two men to be so passionate about their food.  It's
		embarrassing, almost.</p>

		<p>"Well, actually, Frasier --"  Niles had a worried look on his face like he
		was deep in thought, and I could just hear the rest of the rejection forming
		in his  mind.  But it didn't come.  He quickly shook himself out of his
		reverie and looked at his brother.  "Actually, Frasier, I would love that."</p>

		<p>They nodded together, waved their goodbyes to me, and left the studio
		together.</p>

		<p>Maybe Frasier could instill Niles with the good sense I couldn't.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Play It Again, Sam</h2>

		<p>I sat in the dark watching the tv screen.  My fourth time watching
		Casablanca in two days.  And I'd cried each time.</p>

		<p>Rick Blaine and Ilsa Lund -- the perfect couple.  They have everything:
		passion, emotional intimacy, understanding, respect, love.</p>

		<p>But he still makes her leave with Victor Laszlo in the end.</p>

		<p>Why?</p>

		<p>Because it's what's best for her.  What's best for them.</p>

		<p>We'll always have Paris.</p>

		<p>I was looking forward to a lonely night tonight.  Donny was do in sometime
		around mid-afternoon tomorrow.  Despite the comfort of some of my
		girlfriends at the pub the night before, I was lonely.  I missed Doctor
		Crane.  I missed Roz.  I missed Mr. Crane.  I missed Eddie.  And most of
		all, I  missed him.</p>

		<p>But I couldn't go back to the Crane's.  I simply couldn't.  Not after the
		fight with Roz, and not after the ordeal with Niles.  It was supposed to
		make  everything perfect, but all I felt was incredible discomfort.</p>

		<p>Probably because Donny was still in California.  Once he got back, things
		would go back to normal.</p>

		<p>We'll always have Paris.</p>

		<p>We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca.</p>

		<p>I glanced down in the dim light of the tv screen at the stack of books I'd
		read over the past several days to occupy myself. After a few hours of
		reading my  Harlequin romances, I got sick of them, so I pulled some of my
		favorites out again -- the ones I read again and again when I was younger
		but haven't  touched in years.</p>

		<p>Wuthering Heights.  A beautiful leather-bound version Grammy Moon gave me.
		It was in a box Mum had shipped over that was stored in Donny's closet.</p>

		<p>Heathcliff and Catherine are in love, but she goes to be with wealthy Edgar
		Linton.  Because that's what's right.</p>

		<p>Does that make me Heathcliff?</p>

		<p>No, never.  A horrible analogy that should have never crossed my mind.</p>

		<p>Brideshead Revisited.  An English favorite.  One of my favorites as well.
		Charles and Julia -- perhaps not as tragic as Heathcliff and Catherine,
		but....</p>

		<p>She Came To Stay.  Simone de Beauvoir has always moved me.  This one isn't
		tragic, merely a story of the encroachment by a beautiful student on
		Simone's relationship with Jean Paul Sartre.</p>

		<p>And now I was a quarter of the way through a ripped and torn copy of Anna
		Karenina.  Anna's story portrays the tragedy that must inevitably ensure
		when one follows her heart instead of her head.</p>

		<p>My reading of choice had taken a decided turn, it seemed.  I'd always been a
		sucker for these tragic romances -- only recently had the adjective of
		choice  changed from "tragic" to "trashy."  I grinned.  I had to admit the
		trashy romances were fun.  But recent events seem to be bringing my old
		passion for  tragic literature out again.</p>

		<p>Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.</p>

		<p>As Bogie and Claude Raines walked into the sunset, I turned off the tv and
		rewound the movie.  No more Casablanca for you tonight, young lady.</p>

		<p>I flipped on the switch of the lamp behind me, picked up Anna Karenina,
		curled up under the cashmere throw and against the down pillow behind me,
		making sure that the box of tissues was still on the floor beside me.  And I
		began to read.  The first few lines I mumbled aloud.</p>

		<p>"Yes, there is a memory, and at one time it was a bitter one.  I was in love
		with someone and used to sing to him.  I loved him and he loved me; but his
		mother was against it and he married someone else.  You didn't think I'd had
		a romance too?  I'm not unhappy; on the contrary I'm very happy...."</p>

		<h2 align="center">My Dinner With Niles</h2>

		<p>"What a wonderful idea, Frasier!  I've never had better Indian cuisine!"
		Niles exclaimed brightly as we sat in the darkened restaurant working on our
		newly arrived hors d'oeuvre.</p>

		<p>I nodded.  "I hadn't been here before, myself, but it's gotten rave
		reviews."  Now, to business.  "Niles --"</p>

		<p>Niles shook his head sharply.  "No, Frasier.  I know where you're going, and
		I'd prefer not to talk about it.  It's a private matter."</p>

		<p>I nodded.  Reverse psychology, perhaps?  "I know, Niles, and I wasn't going
		to ask you anything or give advice.  I know my advice had gotten you into
		enough trouble where she's concerned.  I only wanted to tell you that if you
		need a sounding board or someone simply to listen -- I'm here.  I'm your
		brother.  That's what I'm for."</p>

		<p>He was quiet for a little while, chewing thoughtfully on a bit of rye bread.
		Finally, he spoke.</p>

		<p>His brow wrinkled as he gazed into my eyes, playing absently with the food
		on his appetizer plate with his fork.  "She seemed so sure, Frasier.  I mean
		about how it was to be.  Sort of a Casablanca ending, you know.  'We'll
		always have Paris.'"</p>

		<p>I must admit, I was a bit confused.  And I'm a psychiatrist.  "What do you
		mean?  I'm not sure I understand the circumstances."</p>

		<p>He sighed.  "She came to me that night with alcohol.  Liquor.  We ate
		cookies, drank whiskey, and talked.  She told me that she was in the process
		of  remembering what she really was to us: an employee.  I hastened to
		assure her otherwise.  Then, I asked her why she never called me Niles.  She
		said  something about boundaries, that, in the beginning, I was her
		employer's brother, and boundaries had to be set."</p>

		<p>"In the beginning.  What about now?"</p>

		<p>He sighed.  "There had to be boundaries because of our feelings for each
		other."  My eyebrows raised.  Each other?, my expression asked.  He nodded
		but then shook his head.  "Primarily my feelings, I think, although she didn't
		say directly."  He paused.  "She asked me how long I'd loved her.  She knew,
		Frasier."  He looked up at me questioningly.</p>

		<p>"Ahem.  Yes.  Well.  She might have overheard a conversation or two not
		meant for her ears...."  I cleared my throat and looked down.</p>

		<p>"No, it's quite all right, Frasier.  If she hadn't, that night never would
		have happened.  The most extraordinary night of my life."  A beat.  "I told
		her.  How  long I'd loved her, I mean, and she hinted that she loved me,
		too, but didn't say.  Somewhere along the line, it was decided that to be
		involved might  tarnish our relationship.  You know, when reality sets in.
		And she has some mistaken ideas about what is proper and right and what is
		not, about station.  We decided, then, that we could have one perfect night
		without damaging us at all, and in the morning, we'd go back to what was
		proper."  He paused and smiled.  "Afterward, she told me she loved me,
		Frasier.  She said, 'I love you,' didn't hedge around it.  There it was.  It
		was phenomenal.  When I woke  up, she was gone, as I knew she would be, and
		I went to pick Mel up at the airport."</p>

		<p>I was, to say the least, shocked.  "And you let this happen, Niles?"</p>

		<p>He looked up at me, resigned.  "It's what she wanted, Frasier.  And if
		that's all that she can give me, I won't demand more.  It was lovely.  She
		was  radiant.  I loved her then more than I had ever loved her."</p>

		<p>"And now?"</p>

		<p>He looked down at his plate, where he was still stirring food around.
		"Nothing has changed."</p>

		<p>My expression became pleading.  "But Niles, don't you see?  She may have
		said those things about her place and your place and propriety... but did
		she  mean it?"  I paused.  "Niles, she's not so much as said a word to any
		of us in days.  She sneaks in to work with dad, talks with him, and leaves
		without so much as telling me she came by.  She hasn't talked to Roz at all
		after their fight.  She's her best friend.  And maybe you'll say that this
		is how it's meant to  work, spending all her time with Donny --"</p>

		<p>He cut me off guiltily.  "She hasn't been spending any time with Donny."</p>

		<p>I looked at him suspiciously.  "And how do you know?"</p>

		<p>"Donny's been in California for two weeks on business."</p>

		<p>"And you know this because?"</p>

		<p>"It's my business.  It has to do with some followup with the divorce.  Some
		property on the beach that wasn't really dealt with in the settlement.  I
		talked  to him today.  He called from Maris' beach house."</p>

		<p>I shook my head sadly.  "Talk to her, Niles."</p>

		<p>He sipped his wine.  "Frasier, did you really discourage me from telling her
		all those years out of jealousy?"</p>

		<p>I nodded.</p>

		<p>"Of what?"</p>

		<p>"Of the love you two shared that I didn't think I would ever have.  Of how
		perfect you two are when you're together.  Of how much you treasure her.  Of
		your commitment."</p>

		<p>He nodded thoughtfully.</p>

		<p>"Niles, discounting what Daphne has said she wanted....  When you consider
		the ideal, your image of a perfect future....  Is she there?"</p>

		<p>He finished his second glass of wine and poured himself a third.  "Of course
		she's there, Frasier.  She's right beside me.  She's holding our child.  Or
		maybe our grandchild."</p>

		<p>I smiled.  "Do you remember the day I had been here in Seattle a year,
		Niles?  I asked you if you loved Daphne."</p>

		<p>He nodded.  "Yes, I remembered.  I think it's the only time I've ever spewed
		coffee across a room."</p>

		<p>I laughed.  "You told me you didn't know.  What's changed?"</p>

		<p>He looked thoughtful.  "Six years, Frasier.  Six years of knowing her and
		learning her.  Then, it was only lust.  I was comfortable with Maris.  You
		remember I told you I wanted to be with Maris and have an affair with
		Daphne.  And then, suddenly, it wasn't Maris with whom I was comfortable."</p>

		<p>"So now, you're comfortable with Daphne?  And is that the true measure of
		happiness?  Comfort?"</p>

		<p>"Yes, I'm more comfortable with Daphne than with anyone.  Especially the
		other night.  After I found out she knew.  The tension was gone.  But is
		that  the measure of happiness?"  He paused.  "Yes, it is, mostly.  Comfort
		would encompass honesty, loyalty, trust, and Platonic love.  But the other
		part of  happiness is passion."</p>

		<p>"You're passionate about Daphne."  It wasn't a question.  "You said six
		years ago that she stirred a passion in you that you'd never known."</p>

		<p>"Yes.  And she still does."</p>

		<p>"So Daphne is, for you, a recipe for true happiness.  What about Mel?"</p>

		<p>This took longer.  "Mel represents the kind of comfort I had with Maris."</p>

		<p>"Can you still be comfortable with that?"</p>

		<p>We were quiet for awhile as he pondered, during which time I chased the
		waiter away twice as he tried to get our entree order.</p>

		<p>"I could be."</p>

		<p>"You weren't happy with Maris, Niles.  Never.  You pretended, but you
		weren't."</p>

		<p>He shook his head.  "But Frasier, if my choice is to have that kind of
		silent comfort or to be alone, then I choose the prior."</p>

		<p>"But what if those weren't your only choices?"</p>

		<p>"They are, Frasier.  Daphne has made it perfectly clear to me where she
		stands."</p>

		<p>I cocked an eyebrow.  "Has she, really, Niles?  Based on what you said about
		her concerns for boundary and station, her feelings of being an employee.
		Niles, I think her attitude about your night together had far more to do
		with her concern for your comfort than her own.  She feels for whatever
		reason that  to be with her would be beneath you and therefore uncomfortable
		for you."</p>

		<p>His eyes lit up in the way they do when he's experienced an epiphany.  "Oh,
		my God, Frasier.  How could she think such a thing?"</p>

		<p>"That's the most important question you can ask, my dear little brother,
		because, if you really care about trying this, once you know why she thinks
		that,  you'll know how to convince her you are comfortable with her and only
		with her."</p>

		<p>"I know you're right.  Of course your right.  But I don't know that I can
		convince her."</p>

		<p>I smiled.  "Try, Niles.  Try now."</p>

		<p>He grinned, nodded, and stood.  "I will!  Thank you so much, Frasier.
		Sometimes your advice stinks, but i have a feeling that today you're on a
		roll!  Oh, and Frasier?"  He looked back at me.</p>

		<p>"Yes, little brother?"</p>

		<p>"Do you remember the question I asked you that day in Cafe Nervosa?"</p>

		<p>"You asked me if I were happy."</p>

		<p>He shook his head.  "And you never answered.  No, put that aside for awhile.
		Another question."</p>

		<p>Suddenly, I knew.  It had been on my mind, too.  "Yes, Niles.  I remember."</p>

		<p>"You're comfortable with her, Frasier.  The passion I have for Daphne is
		important, but really, it's the comfort that matters."</p>

		<p>"I know, Niles.  Thank you."</p>

		<p>He simply nodded thoughtfully and walked out.</p>

		<p>I watched him go, then pulled out my cellular phone.</p>

		<p>Three rings, and then she answered.</p>

		<p>"Roz, I have a wonderful table at the new Indian restaurant on Fremont and a
		lot of news for you.  Would you join me?  No, no, no.  Bring Alice.  I'd
		love to see her."  And I hung up smiling.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Anna Who?</h2>

		<p>The Claremont wasn't Montana, but it was nice in its own way.  It was less
		impressive and regal than the Montana, but it was more... homey.  It was
		comfortable.</p>

		<p>Maybe this was a mistake.</p>

		<p>I stood in front of Donny's apartment door, terrified that he might have
		suddenly decided to come home, that he would answer the door.</p>

		<p>But even more terrified that no one would.</p>

		<p>Because if she weren't here, I didn't know where she could possibly be.</p>

		<p>"I'm coming, I'm coming," I heard her call distantly.</p>

		<p>And then the door was open, and there she was, tissues in hand, eyes
		streaming.</p>

		<p>She stared at me, shocked.  "Niles."</p>

		<p>"I didn't knock."</p>

		<p>She smiled through her tears.  "I knew you would be there."  Then, with a
		self-mocking tone that hurt me, "I'm psychic, remember?"</p>

		<p>"Are you all right, Daphne?  Why are you crying?"</p>

		<p>She snapped out of the daze she had fallen into and ushered me in the
		doorway.  "Oh, I always cry during this part."</p>

		<p>I glanced at the tv screen.  "Oh, Bogie.  Here comes the best part....
		'We'll always have Paris.  We didn't have, we'd lost it until you came to
		Casablanca.  We got it back last night.'"</p>

		<p>She looked up at me.  "'And I said I would never leave you.'"</p>

		<p>I searched my memory t continue the banter, and managed to recite a last few
		last fragments with Bogie.  "'And you never will.  But I've got a job to do,
		too.  Where I'm going you can't follow.  What I've got to do you can't be
		any part of.  Ilsa, I'm not good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to
		see  that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of
		beans in this crazy world.  Someday you'll understand that.  Now, now...."
		I looked up  into her eyes.  "Here's looking at you, kid.'"  I smiled
		self-consciously.  "This is quite coincidental.  I was discussing this film
		with Frasier today."</p>

		<p>Daphne smiled and nodded.  "She had to leave him.  It's so sad, but it's
		right."</p>

		<p>She was speaking to me, then, but I ignored it.  Instead, I glanced at the
		coffee table.  On it were strewn several thoroughly dog-eared books, among
		them  Wuthering Heights and a Simone de Beauvoir that I vaguely remembered
		reading for a class in college.  One in particular caught my eye.  "Anna
		Karenina, Daphne?"</p>

		<p>He laughed a bit, self-consciously, and nodded as she sat on the couch she
		had apparently been staying on.  "'She had wit; she had grace; she had
		beauty;  but above all, she had truth.'"</p>

		<p>I nodded.  "But you're not even close to that part --"</p>

		<p>She shook her head.  "I read it several times when I was a girl.  I fancied
		myself as Anna, the girl who always followed her heart and never her head."
		She bowed her head, then, as I looked down at her.  "That's dangerous,
		though."</p>

		<p>"Daphne, I came here tonight to tell you some things."</p>

		<p>She looked up at me pleadingly.  "You shouldn't, Doctor Crane."</p>

		<p>"Oh, but I need to, Daphne.  It won't take long."  The tv behind me played
		the closing credits of Casablanca.</p>

		<p>She looked up at me soberly.  "All right, then."</p>

		<p>I sighed.  "Daphne, I don't think I ever really loved Maris."</p>

		<p>Whatever she'd been expecting, that wasn't it.  "What?"</p>

		<p>I paced a bit, trying to get out what I needed to say.  But while I could
		feel her gaze trained on me, I avoided looking at her.  "I don't think I
		loved Maris.  What we had was... was a relationship of convenience.  I
		satisfied certain needs she had, and she did the same for me.  I lived a
		very posh lifestyle, yes,  but I never really cared for her.  Not in the
		consuming, passionate way that I need to care for someone.  That I need to
		be cared for.  I was never truly  comfortable with her."  I took a deep
		breath.  "With Mel --"</p>

		<p>She interrupted.  "You're comfortable with Mel."</p>

		<p>At that, I looked at her.  "No, Daphne, I'm not."  I had to look away, then.
		"With Mel, the pattern is the same.  What we have is very appropriate.  It's
		just as everyone would expect.  But while I'm comfortable with that type of
		relationship because I've experienced it before, why should I put myself
		through that kind of unhappiness again?"  I paused.  "Tonight, at dinner,
		Frasier and I were discussing a conversation we had six years ago.  I asked
		him  that day if he were happy with his life.  When he asked me the same
		question, I admitted to him that I wasn't.  That I had never experienced a
		single  moment of pure happiness.  Maris didn't make me happy.  And Mel
		doesn't make me happy.  But you, Daphne --"  I looked at her.  "You make me
		happy.  So happy.  The other night was the most purely joyous night of my
		life.  You light a spark inside me that smolders without you.  I'm
		comfortable  with you, Daphne."  I paused and looked away.  I couldn't bear
		to look at the pity I was sure would be in her eyes.  "I came here tonight
		to tell you,  Daphne, that you will always make me happy, and I would be
		comfortable with you for the rest of our lives, if you would let me."  I
		stopped a moment.  "Daphne, do you remember the ordeal with Rodney?"  She
		nodded.  "And you asked me what would have happened if you and I had met in
		that bar."  I  paused again.  "My name is Niles.  What are you doing for the
		rest of your life?"</p>

		<p>At that point, quite ironically, I began to get very uncomfortable, so I
		cleared my throat and headed toward the door.  She didn't move to follow me,
		and I  was still not brave enough to look at her face.  But before I walked
		out the door, I had to say one more thing.  "You know, Daphne, to be like
		Anna in that  you follow your heart is not bad.  Anna's life was in her own
		hands; she chose her own destiny.  Her passion didn't kill her.  Your
		passion -- it won't kill  you, Daphne.  And to follow it won't kill you
		either.  To be Anna to that extent -- that's beautiful.  After all --"  I
		cleared my throat.  "'She had wit; she had grace; she had beauty; but above
		all, she had truth.'"</p>

		<p>And I left her alone.</p>

		<h2 align="center">My Dinner With Frasier</h2>

		<p>I almost split a seam laughing at Frasier's description of our waiter's
		attitude after being turned away nine times while I was on my way.</p>

		<p>Until I actually saw the waiter's death stare.</p>

		<p>Ouch.  Poor Frasier.</p>

		<p>"So he came to his senses?"</p>

		<p>"Quite!  It was wonderful!  Doctor Frasier Crane's back, and he's better
		than ever!"</p>

		<p>I rolled my eyes.  "So what else happened?  You came to this epiphany about
		the cause of her conditional, and --"</p>

		<p>"And he agreed with me and went to find her."</p>

		<p>Suddenly, his cellular phone rang.</p>

		<p>"Frasier Crane.  Oh, hello, Niles.  You've already left Donny's?"  He paused
		for a minute or two as Niles evidently explained the encounter.  "Oh, you
		did?  How poetic....  So now you wait.  But Niles, I'm confused about one
		thing.  I thought she only read trashy romance novels --"  He drew the phone
		away  from his ear and stared.  "He hung up on me."</p>

		<p>"No shit, Sherlock.  Insult his Intended, do you?"</p>

		<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

		<p>We sat in silence, eating our dinner, for the next few minutes.  Then, he
		looked up.</p>

		<p>"Roz, have you ever thought about... us?"</p>

		<p>I leaned back in my chair.  No sense lying,  I suppose.  "Well, sure,
		Frasier."</p>

		<p>He looked insecure.  Poor baby.  "Do you think it'll ever happen for us,
		Roz?  Are we ever meant to be?"</p>

		<p>"What brings this up now, Frasier?"</p>

		<p>"I told you what I told Niles... about being comfortable.  Just before he
		left, he looked back at me and said, 'You're comfortable with Roz, Frasier.
		That's  all that's really important.'"</p>

		<p>No holds barred, Roz.  The time has come to let it all out.  I gazed at him,
		my best friend, who looked scared out of his mind.  "I guess that I've
		always  sort  of assumed that we'd end up together, Frasier.  We love each
		other."</p>

		<p>He smiled and laid his hand on mine on the table.  No in a creepy way,
		though.  It was one of those reassuring, "I'm always here for you," kind of
		holds.  "Yes, Roz, that we do."</p>

		<p>I grinned at him.  "I know you will be, Frasier, and I appreciate it."  I
		glanced down at my watch.  "Should I go try to talk to Daphne?"</p>

		<p>Frasier pinched the bridge of his nose.  "She hasn't given Niles a response,
		her wedding's in three days, and Donny gets back tomorrow.  Maybe that
		would  be a good idea."</p>

		<p>I smiled, stood, leaned over, and kissed him on the cheek.  He really is a
		darling.  What can I say?  He's my best friend.  "Bye Frasier.  Thanks for
		dinner."  I lifted Alice (who, good baby that she is, hadn't made a peep all
		through dinner) and turned to leave the restaurant.</p>

		<p>From behind me, I could faintly hear his farewell: "Goodnight, honey."</p>

		<h2 align="center">Baggage Claim</h2>

		<p>The second knock on Donny's front door the night before had echoed above the
		running bathwater.</p>

		<p>I ignored it.</p>

		<p>One life-changing visit had left me emotionally exhausted.  There was no was
		in bloody hell I was going to answer the door again.</p>

		<p>Now, though, was a new day.  I sat patiently in the airport terminal waiting
		for my fianc's plane to get in.</p>

		<p>At exactly 1:22, his plane landed.  Ten minutes later, he was coming out of
		it to meet me.</p>

		<p>"Honey!  I missed you so much!"  He dropped his things to wrap me in a bear
		hug.  "I'm so sorry I had to leave so soon before our wedding, Daph.  Niles
		Crane always seems to have excellent timing."  His voice dripped sarcasm.
		He didn't know the half of it.</p>

		<p>I tried to smile.  "What would you say to a late lunch?  I've been taking
		care of last minute details, but there are still things we should talk about
		before the  rehearsal dinner."</p>

		<p>He grinned.  "Anything for you, honey."</p>

		<p>He picked up his bags and threw his free arm around my waist, and we walked
		out of the airport together.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Just Icing On The Cake<br/>
		or<br/>
		The Details</h2>

		<p>To say that she seemed preoccupied would have been the understatement of the
		year, buddy.</p>

		<p>I'm tellin' you, there was something weird going on in that girl's head.</p>

		<p>"Daph, are you all right?"</p>

		<p>But she'd just snap to and say something like, "Oh, of course, Donny.  All
		this wedding stuff, you know.  Lots on my mind."</p>

		<p>So far we'd covered a wide variety of last minute subjects.  Daphne's
		mother, Baby Michael, and Stephen would be flying in the next morning.  In
		fact,  their  plane was scheduled to leave Gatwick within the next few
		hours.  The rest of the family was staying home.  After my disaster with
		Simon....</p>

		<p>Martin would give her away.  We'd planned that for awhile.  If his hip was
		bothering him too much, Frasier would.</p>

		<p>Roz was the Maid of Honor.  But when I asked Daph if they had coordinated
		everything, Daph mentioned something about not speaking to her in several
		days  and changed the subject.</p>

		<p>Great.  For whatever reason, my bride and the maid of honor aren't on
		speaking terms.</p>

		<p>My best man was a buddy of mine from the office, Paul.  The other groomsmen,
		though, included the Crane brothers (as long as Martin was okay) and the two
		Moon brothers flying in.</p>

		<p>The Chapel was confirmed for both rehearsal and wedding, and the parlor was
		reserved for both the rehearsal dinner and the wedding reception.</p>

		<p>Daphne had picked her dress up from her seamstress this morning.  She
		refused to say more than that it was lovely.</p>

		<p>My tux, the result of an exhaustive search and a very good seamstress, was
		ready and waiting in my closet.</p>

		<p>And Daphne was picking up the rings this afternoon.</p>

		<p>We'd chosen to beautiful Celtic rings to symbolize our eternal bond.</p>

		<p>In two short days, I would be married to the woman I loved.</p>

		<p>And I couldn't be happier.</p>

		<h2 align="center">The Tie That Binds</h2>

		<p>When I walked into the jeweler's later that afternoon to pick up our wedding
		rings, I saw Doctor Crane -- Frasier -- standing over one of the glass
		cases.</p>

		<p>"Doctor Crane?"</p>

		<p>He turned around, trying to look surprised.  But I doubt he truly was.  Not
		really.  "Daphne.  Fancy seeing you in here.  I was home today wrapping your
		wedding present when I decided that it was completely insufficient.  How
		could any gift possibly express to you what you've meant to us?  All of us."
		He grinned.  "Especially Eddie.  The little guy's in pieces.  'Where's
		Daphne?' he keeps asking me.  And I have to say, 'Now, Eddie, she's leaving
		us.'"</p>

		<p>I smiled at him.  "You're sweet when you try, Doctor Crane.  Thank you.  And
		you know I'm going to miss you, too.  I've enjoyed working for you."</p>

		<p>He shook his head, but he was still smiling.  "I hope you know how much more
		than that you are to us, Daphne.  To me.  You're a friend.  Ah, hell,
		you're  family, and you know it.  You're like a little sister to me, Daph,
		complete with fights, insults, and all.  I love you, Daphne.  Never forget
		that.  You're part  of  our family."</p>

		<p>I smiled at him.  "Thank you, Doctor Crane.  I needed to hear that."</p>

		<p>"And that's another thing, Daphne.  We've established that you're family.
		The very least you could do is call me Frasier."</p>

		<p>My smile grew.  "All right, Frasier."</p>

		<p>"So what'd you come in here for, Daphne?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, just picking up the wedding rings."  The clerk, an older man with
		jeweler's glasses on, came over, and I told him the name the rings were
		under.</p>

		<p>Frasier looked downs.  "Oh."</p>

		<p>We stood in silence until the clerk came back.</p>

		<p>"This was a beautiful choice.  The eternity ring.  It's so lovely when I see
		two people --"  He glanced between Frasier and me.  "-- who love each other
		so  much that they want to commit not only their lives but their very souls
		forever to each other."  He smiled.  "That's what this ring means to me."</p>

		<p>I started to say something in protest.  "Oh, no, he --"</p>

		<p>Frasier interrupted by throwing his arm around my shoulders.  "Yes, yes.
		We're very happy.  C'mon, honey.  Let's get out of here."</p>

		<p>I nodded, too shocked to do anything else, collected the rings, and left
		with him.</p>

		<p>We were quiet for a while, his arm still wound around me as we walked down
		the street.  "It really is a beautiful thought, Daphne."  He paused.
		"Committing  your soul to him.  Forever.  Completely."</p>

		<p>And then the reality of the situation hit me.</p>

		<p>I always thought Niles' panic attacks were sort of funny.  I mean, I took
		care of him during them, but it didn't make them any less amusing.</p>

		<p>Okay, so they're funny until you have one.  I started hyperventilating so
		badly that Frasier had to help me inside the nearest store, a locally owned
		bookstore,  so I could sit down.</p>

		<p>"Deep breaths, Daphne.  Deep breaths.  Head between the knees if it gets
		worse.  Deep breaths."</p>

		<p>Slowly but surely, I began to calm down.</p>

		<p>"That's right.  That's right.  Good girl."  He looked up at me from where he
		was kneeling in front of me.  "Forever is a long time, Daphne.  I need you
		to  be  sure."</p>

		<p>I nodded slowly, still having trouble breathing.  "I've got to go, Doctor
		Crane," I gasped.</p>

		<p>He looked at me like he looks at Roz when she tells him she didn't sleep
		with one of her dates.  With the cocked eyebrow that says, "Yea, right."
		"Are  you  sure you can make it by yourself, Daphne?  Do you need help?"</p>

		<p>"No!"  I was still gasping for breath.  "I can do this on my own."  And I
		jumped up and made my way to the door.  As an afterthought, I turned back to
		him.  "Thank you for trying, Frasier, but I think it's too late."  I smiled
		sadly.</p>

		<p>"Daphne, I've loved three women in my life.  The first left me at the altar.
		The second left me for an eco-pod and a man named Pascal."  He looked at me
		for a bit.  I wondered if he was psychic enough to read my death-stare.
		This wasn't helping.  "But I've never regretted trying, Daphne.  The first
		gave me some of the most glorious memories of my former life, if some
		painful ones, and the second gave me Freddie.  The third -- she'll be with
		me for the rest of my life.  And I'm so happy I've had the courage to find
		that out.  But Daphne, I tried because I loved them, not because it was
		right.  And I've never looked back.  And I never will."</p>

		<p>He was wrong.  Not about his own life, really (although I must say myself
		that any woman who leaves a man at the altar or causes him to jump off a
		building wasn't worth the time), just about how it applied to mine.</p>

		<p>"Thank you for trying," I repeated softly and turned away from him.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Martin Hatches An Egg</h2>

		<p>The next day was pretty hectic.  Daph took us to the airport with her and
		Donny.  I guess she wanted her mother and brothers to meet her make-shift
		family right away.  'Cept it wasn't all of us.  Just me and Fras.  Niles
		had "things to do."  Whatever.  He's avoiding her.  I may not know the
		details, but I  know  my boys, and I know Daph, and I know when something's
		up.</p>

		<p>We took two cars.  Fras and I road in the BMW, and Daph rode with Donny.</p>

		<p>Fras hadn't said a word since we had set out.</p>

		<p>I was gonna get to the bottom of this.</p>

		<p>"Spill, Fras.  I know something weird's going on."</p>

		<p>He sighed.</p>

		<p>"It's Daphne and Niles, Dad."</p>

		<p>I rolled my eyes.  "Well, I figured that out.  They spent the other night
		together.  She's still marrying Donny?"</p>

		<p>He looked at me suspiciously.  "How'd you know that?"</p>

		<p>Oh, yeah, I forgot.  My boy Frasier couldn't deduce his way out of a paper
		bag.  The monkey did it!  What a crock.  "Frasier, I was a cop my whole
		life.  I  have a way of figuring these things out."</p>

		<p>He sighed.  "She loves Niles, but yea, she's still going through with it.
		And I think she's fooling herself into thinking it's for Niles' sake.
		Because she  doesn't deserve him or something."  He shook his head.  "I
		can't believe it."</p>

		<p>I was as shocked as hell.  "What?!  Why would she think that?"</p>

		<p>"For some reason, recently, she's been thinking that she's just an employee
		to us.  I don't know why.  We've been trying to convince her otherwise to no
		avail."</p>

		<p>I shook my head.  He could be so dense sometimes.  "Aw, Jeez, Fras.  You
		can't just tell her.  You've got to show her."</p>

		<p>He did that little indignant head-shake that he does.  "Yea, well, Dad, I've
		tried.  If you'd like to give it a shot yourself, be my guest."</p>

		<p>I leaned back in the passenger seat of Frasier's Beamer.  "I think I'll do
		that."</p>

		<p>My boy has a way of making like too damn complicated.</p>

		<p>It doesn't have to be.</p>

		<p>I smiled as I started hatching my plan.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Terminal Woman</h2>

		<p>Martin and Frasier parked beside us at the airport, and then the four of us
		walked into the airport together to wait on Daph's family.</p>

		<p>Lucky for us, we didn't have to wait at all.  The arrival of their flight
		was announced just as we walked into the airport, so Daphne, in a panic,
		hailed the  first automatic cart she could find, shoved us all onto it, and
		directed the driver to go.  Fast.  Or she'd do something very unpleasant to
		the lower regions of his  anatomy.</p>

		<p>We were there before I knew we had left.</p>

		<p>As soon as we got to the gate, Daph leapt off the cart and ran over to a
		short, angry woman just exiting the plane.  "Mum!"</p>

		<p>The woman shook her head.  "Daphne, I think we should sue this airline.
		First of all, they won't let me bring me own alcohol, and then they won't
		even  serve me breakfast bourbon!  Then, they have the nerve to complain
		when I gave that handsome flight attendant a slap on the bum.  Really, I
		don't  know  what kind of country you're living in, Daphne, where breakfast
		bourbon and handsome gentlemen aren't for the taking."</p>

		<p>Dear God.  This woman is going to be my mother-in-law.</p>

		<p>Suck it up, Donald Ronald Douglas, and deal with the lemons life hands ya.</p>

		<p>"Mum, where are Stephen and Michael?"</p>

		<p>The robust little woman looked around, seemingly puzzled.  "Oh, they're
		talking to the flight attendants.  Must be telling them what we think of
		saucy  Americans."</p>

		<p>Daph nodded and grinned as her two brothers walked off the gangway.
		"Michael!"  She hugged him and kissed his cheek, then whispered to him.  I
		could just make it out.  "Did you apologize for Mum?"</p>

		<p>He kissed her back.  "Of course, Daphne."</p>

		<p>"Hope it wasn't too unbearable.  Thank you for doing it."</p>

		<p>Just then, the second one, Stephen, grabbed her from behind.  "Hallo, my
		darling baby sister.  Getting married!"  He kissed her cheek.  "So is this
		the  lucky  gent who's stealing our Daphne from us?"</p>

		<p>And he had the nerve to point at Frasier.</p>

		<p>Daphne just smiled.  "No, Stephen, this is Doctor Frasier Crane, my
		employer."</p>

		<p>Martin laughed at that.  "He's the lucky gent who stole her seven years
		ago."  He stuck out his hand.  "Marty Crane.  You can consider me Daphne's
		American dad.  I certainly consider her like a daughter."</p>

		<p>Stephen and Michael both shook his hand, then Frasier made introductions.
		Since no one seemed eager to introduce me, I introduced myself.  "I'm the
		lucky  gent who's stealing Daphne this time around.  Donny Douglas."</p>

		<p>Stephen, the big one with dark hair and ruddy skin, grabbed my shoulders.
		"So, chap, let us get a good look at the bloke who's gotten Daphne's heart."</p>

		<p>Martin smiled as the two brothers manhandled me.  "It's too bad my son Niles
		couldn't be here to meet you.  He considers Daphne his best friend.  I know
		he  wishes he were here but he had --"  He paused.  "-- um -- a thing."  He
		grinned again.  "You'll meet him tonight.  He's a groomsman."</p>

		<p>Mama Moon looked me up and down, then turned to Daphne.  "Niles.  Daphne,
		you've told me quite a bit about him, haven't you, dear?  Of course, since
		you call  them both Doctor Crane, it's a bit hard to figure it all out.
		Well, I'll be glad to meet him.  I know you three boys have all been very
		special to Daphne these past seven years.  You've made America home to her."</p>

		<p>Martin smiled again.  "Well, she's home to us."</p>

		<p>His voice sounded really determined -- or something -- and I tried for a
		moment to figure out if he had something else on his mind.</p>

		<p>Daph interrupted my thoughts, though.  "So, Mum, I thought you would ride
		with Donny and me, and I thought maybe you two could ride with Doctor...
		Frasier and Mr. Crane."</p>

		<p>I put my arm around Daphne's waist, and we walked toward baggage claim.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Car Trouble</h2>

		<p>"What did your mom pack, anyway, guys, bricks?"  Stephen and Michael, both
		tall, dark-haired men -- Stephen rugged and Michael polished -- laughed at
		Dad's comment.</p>

		<p>"She's always like this.  Personally, I think Daph probably could have made
		it through the wedding without her, but she wanted us here, and there's no
		way in bloody hell Mum would have let us see our sister's wedding without
		her.  Daph had sense enough to tell her she wanted her here."</p>

		<p>Dad grinned as he looked over the back seat.  "You know, we're really gonna
		miss her.  She's family to us.  Like I said, she's like a daughter to me,
		like a sister to Frasier, and Niles --  well, that's another story."</p>

		<p>Stephen smiled.  "She's told us a lot about you all."</p>

		<p>Michael shook his head.  "That's not really quite true.  She's told us quite
		a few things about you and your sons, but we've heard very little about
		Donny."  His accent was much different from his brother's, different even
		from Daphne's.  It was a very polished, almost Royal English.</p>

		<p>Dad grinned again.  Oh, God.  I could see the wheels in his head spinning,
		and if he thought for one second he was going to play saboteur to this
		wedding....</p>

		<p>Well, he could just go right ahead.</p>

		<p>"Oh, Donny.  You want to know about Donny?  He's pretty ruthless.  When my
		boy Niles was going through a hard divorce, he was tooth-and-nails as his
		lawyer.  He was the same way about getting Daphne.  He knew how Niles felt
		about her, but he --"</p>

		<p>"Dad!" I interrupted on cue.  "Don't give them the wrong idea about Donny."
		I glanced at them in the rear-view mirror.  They were both slightly agape.
		"It was Niles' fault, really, that he didn't tell her sooner.  He wanted to
		wait until everything was cleared up before he said anything, and he
		confided in Donny.  But before you knew it, Donny had swooped down for the
		kill!"  I grinned.  "But there're no hard feelings.  That's just the way
		Donny is."</p>

		<p>"Oh, really?  He doesn't sound like the kind of chap I'd have my big sister
		with," Michael began.</p>

		<p>"Oh, no!" Dad cut in in the most insincere tone of worry I've ever hear.
		"We've given them the wrong idea, Frasier.  It really was all Niles' fault,
		boys.  No need to feel sorry for him.  I always say, 'When you know who you
		want to spend your life with, you should tell her!'  He didn't listen.  Too
		cautious.  His mother did that to him."</p>

		<p>Stephen nodded thoughtfully.  "You know, Daph's said quite a bit about your
		son, Martin."</p>

		<p>Dad laughed.  "We've heard a lot about you guys as well.  Especially you,
		Michael."  If he brought up the toe story, I was going to hit him, I swear.
		So I took over.</p>

		<p>"What has she said about Niles?"  Perhaps it was not quite as nonchalant as
		I was aiming, and that lilt at the end might have turned some heads, but I
		was too worked up to notice.</p>

		<p>Michael grinned and elbowed Stephen.  "You remember what she told us about
		that fancy dance he took her to, and about how he told her he adored her?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, yea, but what about that bloke she dated who she realized later looked
		exactly like him?"</p>

		<p>"Or that single's bar."</p>

		<p>"Or the time he proposed."</p>

		<p>"Or when she was stranded in that mansion of his."</p>

		<p>Dad was positively glowing.  "I see she tells you a lot about him.  I wonder
		why she hasn't said so much about Donny?  Hmmmmmmmmmmmm."  I've never in my
		life heard a more exaggerated noise.  I rolled my eyes and prayed they
		wouldn't see in the mirror.</p>

		<p>"But you know, boys, it's a moot point now.  Daphne's marrying Donny."  I
		sighed.  "And, after all," I resumed with as much emotion as I could muster,
		"all Niles really wants is for Daphne to be happy."</p>

		<p>And we left it at that for them to ponder.  The rest of the conversation had
		to do with weather in Seattle, the apartment, where the brothers would be
		staying.</p>

		<p>And I told them Niles would be quite happy to let them stay at the Montana.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Moon Men</h2>

		<p>It took me a few seconds to place the two men standing at my door with Dad
		and Frasier, but then I recognized them both from the photos Daphne shows me
		periodically.  "You're Stephen and Michael."</p>

		<p>They grinned together.</p>

		<p>In their features, they both resembled Daphne.  Michael's hair was the same
		brown as Daphne's and neatly trimmed while Stephen's was a bit lighter and
		quite a bit shaggier.  They both had her large eyes, her strong cheekbones.
		Stephen looked rough; he was the kind of big brother meant to intimidate
		potential suitors with his broad shoulders and large arms.  Michael, on the
		other hand, was....  Well, he seemed, on the exterior, at least, a lot like
		me.  He was very clean cut and was dressed in a neat, tailored suit.  I was
		astonished that he could look so neat after spending a dozen hours on a
		plane and was about to ask how he managed it before I thought better of it.</p>

		<p>I liked them both right away.</p>

		<p>"Please, do come in.  Make yourselves at home."  I gestured for them to
		enter, and they took their seats on my fainting couch.  "Sherry?"</p>

		<p>Dad looked at me like I was crazy (I think I caught a muttered, "Aw, Jeez"),
		but Frasier and Michael both nodded.  "That sounds absolutely smashing.  But
		I know my brother here would prefer --"</p>

		<p>He glanced over at him.  Stephen looked up.  "Nothing for me, thanks."  He
		studied me for a few seconds.  "So you're Niles."  As if this were meant to
		tell me something profound.</p>

		<p>"Yes.  I'm Niles."</p>

		<p>I walked to my wet bar to pour Frasier's sherry, and my brother followed me.
		"Where's Mel, Niles?"  I glanced up.</p>

		<p>"She has a week-long conference across town.  But never fear, she will be at
		the rehearsal tonight and the wedding tomorrow."</p>

		<p>He nodded.  When I glanced over at Daphne's brothers, Stephen was still
		staring at me.  For some reason, Dad was grinning from the corner of the
		room.</p>

		<p>"When Daphne described you to me, I imagined you... differently."  His voice
		was rough with a slight Cockney flair.</p>

		<p>His words got my attention.  "How so?"</p>

		<p>He shook his head.  "Oh, no matter.  My little sister can never tell it to
		you straight."</p>

		<p>I probably should have dropped it there, but I was intrigued.  And I feared
		the worst.  "How did she describe me?"</p>

		<p>He grinned.  "It's just that... she called you dashing.  And I mean no
		offense, but you're not the type Daphne usually finds dashing...."</p>

		<p>I opened and closed my mouth several embarrassing times like a kind of
		codfish, but I had no idea how to respond.  "Oh.  That sherry."  I set to
		work pouring Michael's drink.  "Something to eat, perhaps?  Cookies?
		Fruit?"</p>

		<p>Frasier glanced over at me, his eyebrows twitching as if he were scheming.
		I'm frankly scared of that look.  "Oh, by the way, Niles, I've told Michael
		and Stephen that since Donny doesn't have room for them at his apartment,
		they're welcome to stay with you for a few days here."</p>

		<p>I almost dropped the sherry, and my mouth did the ridiculous fish-motions
		again.  "Oh."  Somehow, I found my resolve.  "Well, that would be simply
		splendid.  Here's your sherry, Michael."  I looked around at my guests and
		rubbed my hands together anxiously.  "So, what's the agenda today, my good
		fellows?  Perhaps we could go to a late lunch?"</p>

		<p>Michael rose from his seat.  "Splendid!  Where to?"</p>

		<p>From where they stood, Frasier and Dad still wore those mysterious grins.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Let's Do Lunch</h2>

		<p>Lunch was going swimmingly, if I do say so myself.  Stephen and Dad were
		immersed in a "deep" conversation about English beer, and Michael, an
		architect, and my brother were immersed in converse about the Gothic style
		of architecture.</p>

		<p>And I was grinning like a hyena.</p>

		<p>Except my motives were entirely altruistic.</p>

		<p>One thing remained on my mind: the rift between Roz and Daphne which, the
		day before the wedding, was still not mended.  I'd talked to Roz about it,
		but she refused to say a word to Daphne.  I hadn't seen Daphne since we left
		the airport, but I knew she wouldn't be the first to extend the olive
		branch.</p>

		<p>And the rehearsal was tonight.</p>

		<p>My four lunch companions remained in constant conversation.  That was a good
		thing.  That was what we wanted to happen.</p>

		<p>But why?</p>

		<p>The tragic flaw in my plan, you see, is that I had no idea how it would
		resolve itself.  Blindly, I had thrown some ingredients together with no
		real thought as to the product.</p>

		<p>Damn.  I knew it couldn't have been so easy.</p>

		<p>So, throughout lunch, I pondered what Michael and Niles' newfound friendship
		could do for my brother's relationship with Daphne.</p>

		<p>Obviously, Niles considered Michael an equal.  If Daphne were to realize
		that....</p>

		<p>No.  I took a bite of bread.  No more manipulations for me.  At least not
		until I could come up with a "smashing" plan....</p>

		<h2 align="center">The Missing Pieces</h2>

		<p>I didn't see my brothers again until the rehearsal dinner.</p>

		<p>"So, where have you boys been all afternoon?" I said in greeting.</p>

		<p>They glanced at each other.  "We sort of went our separate ways," Stephen
		responded.</p>

		<p>That surprised me.  The two brothers I had chosen to invite to Seattle
		admittedly had little in common, but my family has always had a way of
		sticking together.</p>

		<p>Until I moved to America, of course.</p>

		<p>"Oh, really?  So spill.  Were you with Frasier?  Mr. Crane?"</p>

		<p>We began walking toward the reception hall, Michael's arm slung around my
		waist.  "Stephen here spent most of the afternoon learning the rules to
		about fifteen different American sports with Martin, and I spent the
		afternoon with that smashing friend of yours, Niles."</p>

		<p>I turned to him, surprised.  "Oh, really?  What did you do?"</p>

		<p>"He showed my some of Seattle's more interesting architectural styles, we
		discussed Greek revivalism over coffee at a charming little venture called
		Cafe Nervosa, and we toured a few museums."</p>

		<p>Stephen shook his head.  "Mikey, sometimes I wonder that you and I are
		actually related...."</p>

		<p>Michael looked at me meaningfully.  "He's a splendid fellow, Daph.
		Excellent."</p>

		<p>I smiled at him.  "I know he is, Michael.  He's very special to me."  Then,
		I kissed them each on the cheek and walked toward Frasier, who had just come
		into the hall.  "Doctor Crane," I said, smiling.  "Have you talked to Roz?"</p>

		<p>She hadn't come.</p>

		<p>She hadn't come to my rehearsal.</p>

		<p>She's my bloody maid of honor.</p>

		<p>And while I was very calm on the outside, I was seething inside.  And I know
		Doctor Crane noticed.  He knows me too well not to.  He shook her head
		sympathetically and gave me a hug.  "I talked to her this morning, but she
		didn't sat anything about this, Daphne."  He paused.  "I know the two of you
		are going through a rough patch right now, Daph, but she's not the type to
		hold grudges.  She knows when she's wrong.  She'll be here tomorrow for you,
		if that's what you were worried about."</p>

		<p>Embarrassingly enough, I'd started crying slightly, so I buried my head
		further into his shoulder.  "It's not really that, Doctor Crane.  Yes, what
		she said hurt me, but more than that -- I'm so afraid that she might have
		been right."</p>

		<p>He held me tighter and spoke very deliberately.  "That's something you're
		going to have to decide on your own, Daphne.  No one can tell you what you
		should do.  Not Roz.  Not me.  Not Niles.  This is you, Daphne.  It's your
		life."</p>

		<p>I nodded into his shoulder, feeling more uncertain than ever.</p>

		<p>"But whatever decision you make, Daphne --"  He pulled back from me and
		looked into me leaking eyes.  "-- make sure it's the right one for you."
		Then, he kissed my forehead and wiped my tears away.  He's such a good man
		when he wants to be.  He smiled.  "Now go to your dinner and savor every
		second.  Life passes much too quickly."</p>

		<p>I had to ask him one more thing.  "Frasier, did you truly try to prevent him
		from telling me?"</p>

		<p>His face fell.  "I'm so, so sorry, Daphne."</p>

		<h2 align="center">Last Dance</h2>

		<p>Earlier in the evening, I had seen the exchange between Daphne and my
		brother.  She had been crying.  Now, shortly before the end of the
		festivities, I approached him.  "How has your evening been, Frasier?"  Mine
		had been droll, aside from the company of Daphne's fabulous younger brother.
		And Mel, of course.</p>

		<p>He sighed.  "I don't know, Niles."  He wasn't looking at me, so I followed
		his line of sight.</p>

		<p>To where Daphne and Donny were dancing closely together.</p>

		<p>Frasier looked at me in sympathy.  "I was so sure, Niles.  I'm sorry."</p>

		<p>I shook myself.  "No, Frasier, it's quite all right.  This is how it should
		be."</p>

		<p>He nodded solemnly.  "Will Mel be driving you and the boys to the Montana,
		or do you need a ride?"  Mel had picked Michael and me up at the gallery
		after, I suppose, the last plastic surgeon had spoken.</p>

		<p>"Actually, Frasier, she left a few minutes ago.  Would it be any trouble?"</p>

		<p>"Of course not, Niles!  I'd be happy to give you and the boys a ride to the
		Montana.  The least I can do."</p>

		<p>I nodded and glanced over at Daphne.  She was whispering something in his
		ear, and he was smiling.  "Can we go now, Frasier?"</p>

		<p>He looked over and nodded.  "Yes, we'll go now."  He looked at me.  "You
		should tell her you're leaving.  Or do you want me to tell her you had to
		hurry?"</p>

		<p>I took a deep breath.  "No.  No, I'll tell her.  You gather Stephen and
		Michael."</p>

		<p>And slowly, I made my way over to where she now sat with Donny.</p>

		<p>"Daphne."</p>

		<p>Her head shot up at me, and she held her hand out slightly in my direction.
		"Doctor Crane.  I haven't seen you all evening -- I was wondering if maybe
		you'd slipped out without telling me."  Her brow creased a bit at that.</p>

		<p>"No, of course not, Daphne.  But I wanted to tell you...."  I smiled and
		took her hand.  "It's been lovely."  I looked down at our joined hands, a
		slight sadness engulfing me.  "Goodbye, Daphne."</p>

		<p>She nodded.  "Goodbye, Doctor Crane."</p>

		<p>It sounded so final.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Just Say "I Do"</h2>

		<p>The wedding was supposed to be at eleven o'clock.  I, always prompt, came
		clambering up the steps of the chapel in the dress Daphne and I had chosen
		together at ten fifty-five.</p>

		<p>I hadn't seen Daph in about a week and had been feeling really guilty about
		the things I'd said to her.  I guess we'd both been right, in a way, but we
		sure could've found a better way to say it.</p>

		<p>Right now, I was mostly feeling bad for skipping the rehearsal.  But
		honestly, I thought it would break my heart to see Niles in the same room as
		Daphne and Donny.</p>

		<p>Yeah, yeah.  I know.  Old age is making me a big sap.</p>

		<p>Shut up.</p>

		<p>So, anyway, I scrambled up the steps, holding up my skirt, until I got to
		the back of the church.  Daphne was there with Martin and a couple of her
		girlfriends, the bridesmaids.</p>

		<p>She saw me as soon as the door opened.</p>

		<p>"Roz."</p>

		<p>"Daph --"  I bowed my head.  I couldn't stand to look at her I felt so
		guilty.</p>

		<p>I hate feeling guilty.</p>

		<p>"I'm so sorry about the things I said, Daph.  I had no right.  If anyone
		knows what's best for you, it's you."  I looked up at her a bit pleadingly.
		"I just hope you've thought about it enough."  I looked away for a second.
		"This is forever, Daphne."</p>

		<p>She nodded, and Marty walked up to her and took her arm.  "You ready, Daph?"</p>

		<p>She nodded.  "Yes, Mr. Crane.  I believe I am."  She took a deep breath, and
		I took my place in the line behind the bridesmaids.</p>

		<p>The music started, and we began to walk.</p>

		<p>Always the bridesmaid, never the bride, eh, Roz?</p>

		<p>I felt like I was watching everything from a distance.  Suddenly, I was
		standing in front of the guests without much of a clue how I'd gotten myself
		up there.</p>

		<p>I watched Daphne walk up the aisle.  She's so graceful -- always a lady.</p>

		<p>I watched Niles watch Daphne with as much passion as I'd ever seen.  Yea, he
		could be ridiculous sometimes in his infatuation with Daphne, but this
		willingness to let her slip through his fingers --.  He was right.  That was
		love.  I could only wish that someone could love me so much.</p>

		<p>I watched Mel fix her lipstick.  What a witch.  But Daphne says she really
		does care about Niles.  I hope so, for his sake, or I'll kick her sorry ass.
		You know, it's amazing how find of the little weed I've gotten over the past
		seven years.</p>

		<p>Martin gave Daphne away and took his seat reluctantly behind Mel.  She tried
		to talk to him about something undoubtedly ridiculous, Daphne's dress or the
		like, but he ignored her.  Way to go, Marty.</p>

		<p>All of a sudden, the minister was talking, Niles was gazing at Daphne from
		over Donny's wiry little head, and my heart was breaking.  I caught
		Frasier's eye from where he stood behind Niles and held it.</p>

		<p>"Marriage is a sacred bond, a bond that will be held between these two
		people for the rest of their lives.  They share a very special bond which
		will never be broken after this day.  Therefore, if anyone in this room
		knows of any reasons why these two should not be joined in matrimony, let
		him speak now or forever hold his peace."</p>

		<p>That's when I did it.  I made this little, unintentional choking noise in my
		throat, and then I coughed.</p>

		<p>The minister looked over at me expectantly, and I froze.</p>

		<p>"Um -- um -- um."  My mumbling resounded throughout the church.  And just
		when I thought that I should say something, that I had to, I caught Niles'
		eye and saw him shaking his head.  I whispered a hasty apology, and the
		minister continued.</p>

		<p>"Do you, Donald Ronald Douglas, take Daphne Moon to be your lawfully wedded
		wife, to have and to hold in sickness and in health, in good times and bad,
		until death do you part?"</p>

		<p>He smiled assuredly and lovingly at Daphne.  "I do."  I looked up at Niles.
		His eyes were closed tightly.</p>

		<p>"Do you, Daphne Moon, take Donald Ronald Douglas to be your lawfully wedded
		husband, to have and to hold in sickness and in health, in good times and
		bad, until death do you part?"</p>

		<p>"I --"  She stopped.  I watched her face carefully.  She looked terrified.
		Then, she looked at Niles, whose eyes were still closed, his lashes wet.
		She glanced at Frasier.  His head was bowed, his eyes trained on the floor.
		"I --"  She looked at me, but I refused to help her with this decision.  I
		held her gaze but didn't hint anything in either direction.</p>

		<p>Finally, she looked at Donny.  He looked as terrified as I knew she was.  He
		knew what was happening.  How could he not?  "I --  I'm so sorry, Donny."</p>

		<p>And with that, she ran back down the aisle.</p>

		<p>I looked around the room.  Frasier was still looking at his feet, but he was
		glowing, I could tell, grinning from ear to ear.  Donny just looked after
		her, unsure what to do, maybe even unsure what had happened.  Daphne's
		brothers were lightly punching each other, back and forth.  Hmm....  They're
		pretty cute.  Then I remembered that Michael's the one without a toe.  Ick.
		Maris -- ouch!  I mean Mel -- was looking at Niles rather sternly, and Marty
		was watching his son with a smile on his face.</p>

		<p>And Niles?</p>

		<p>He wasn't grinning exactly.  To someone who didn't know him, his expression
		might not have said much.  He had a sort of slow smile on his face.  But
		someone who knew him -- as Mel did, which might explain her expression of
		anger and pain -- could tell he was glowing.</p>

		<p>His smile spread into a grin before he caught himself and looked down.</p>

		<p>That's when I realized that if anyone was going to go out there to her, it
		was going to be me.</p>

		<p>I jumped off the raised platform mumbling apologies and ran out after her.</p>

		<h2 align="center">Runaway Bride</h2>

		<p>I was sitting on the cement steps at the side of the church, skirt hiked up
		from beneath me.  The last thing I wanted to do was ruin an unpaid for,
		unused wedding dress.</p>

		<p>What had I just done?  What had I just bloody done?</p>

		<p>Oh, God.</p>

		<p>I rested my elbows on my knees and buried my face in my hands.  Just then, I
		heard footsteps from behind me.  "Hey Daphne."</p>

		<p>I sighed.  "Hey Roz."</p>

		<p>She came around in front of me.  "I don't mean to rush you at this painful
		time, Daph, but your mom was chasing me down the aisle.  Unless you want her
		to catch us, I say we get lost."</p>

		<p>Oh Lord.  If things couldn't get worse.  "C'mon!  Your place."</p>

		<p>We ran together to Roz's car.  Unfortunately, since she'd gotten there so
		frightfully late, she'd had to park a good two blocks away.</p>

		<p>We must've made quite a pair, bride and maid of honor, me holding my veil
		and train, Roz carrying her shoes in her hand, running down the sidewalk.</p>

		<p>The kicker, though, was the older plump woman with bright red dyed hair
		running about a block behind us, yelling come-ons to any biker or driver of
		the opposite sex.</p>

		<p>It's certainly a good thing she bowled a biker down on the way after us or
		else we might never have made a clean getaway.</p>

		<p>He was still trying to get away from her when Roz peeled out of her parking
		space.  And we were free.</p>

		<p>For the time being.</p>

		<h2 align="center">And There's More Where That Came From</h2>

		<p>When I looked up at my brother, he was still gazing dreamily out the door.
		Unfortunately, Donny wasn't having the same reaction.</p>

		<p>There he sat, right in front of the altar where he was to be married just a
		few minutes hence.</p>

		<p>I felt bad for him.  Really.</p>

		<p>But I felt wonderful for my brother.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, Donny chose that moment to look up at me pleadingly.  "Doc,
		did she day anything to you?  Why would she do this?"  Thankfully, he missed
		Niles' dumb gaze, but Mel sure didn't.</p>

		<p>"Niles, how could you do this to me?"  She had run up to him and was beating
		his chest with her fists.</p>

		<p>I leaned toward her.  "Party face, Mel."  Then, I looked down at Donny.
		"I'll admit that I knew she was having serious doubts.  But I can say with
		absolute honesty that I was sure this ceremony this morning would proceed."
		I paused.  "I think Daphne's come to some important conclusions about her
		life.  She's still got some important things to work through, and she alone
		can tell us what the outcome to this little situation will be."</p>

		<p>Now, Mel had ceased hitting Niles and had instead buried her head into his
		shoulder pitifully.  "Nilesy, don't do this.  Why did you do this?"  Her
		head shot up.  "Maris was right all along, wasn't she?  Wasn't she?"</p>

		<p>Niles whispered a few hasty things to her, and she ran out.</p>

		<p>But that wasn't to be the end of it.</p>

		<p>Donny looked at Niles in awe.  "Maris was right, wasn't she, Niles?  You're
		in love with Daphne."</p>

		<p>He looked down at Donny, his smile fading.  "I've been in love with Daphne
		for a very, very long time.  Nothing has changed."</p>

		<p>Donny shook his head.  "But something has changed.  Something between you
		two.  And that's why she left."</p>

		<p>Niles held out his hands desperately as Daphne's guests were going crazy all
		around.  Roz had gone after Daphne, and Daphne's utterly insane mother had
		gone after Roz.  Daphne's brothers were brawling jokingly at the corner of
		the room.  The guests had long since begun to run about the chapel, and the
		minister was trying to calm them.  I focused off the rest of the insanity
		and on my brother.  "I never meant for this to happen.  I never wanted it to
		be like this."</p>

		<p>Donny shook his head angrily and stood up.  "Are you so sure, Niles?"  Then
		he, too, left the chapel.</p>

		<p>I grinned.  "C'mere, little brother!"  He threw himself into my arms as we
		shared a giant bear hug.  "Congratulations."</p>

		<p>He sighed as he pulled away.  "We'll see, Frasier.  We'll see."</p>

		<h2 align="center">Stringed Peas All Over My Face</h2>

		<p>I sat one my sofa sipping coffee, watching Daphne feed Alice.  Daphne had
		talked briefly with Donny to cancel things once and for all, and then we had
		both changed into some of my clothes.  I was in some frumpy sweats, and she
		had borrowed a nice skirt and shirt ensemble which was currently covered
		almost entirely by a large beach towel.  It was a good thing, too, because
		Alice was throwing her peas and beets all over my friend.</p>

		<p>"So why'd you do it, Daph?"</p>

		<p>She looked up at me matter-of-factly.  Despite her strange mood of past
		days, Daph is, on the whole, the most down-to-earth person I know.</p>

		<p>Well, except for the psychic thing.</p>

		<p>"I just sort of stood there, thinking to myself, 'This is forever.
		Forever.'  I could hear my heart pounding, and I looked over and saw Niles,
		and I could tell he was crying a bit.  I thought about everything he told me
		the other night -- about spending the rest of our lives together.  It's not
		that I necessarily want to dive into something right away, but I decided
		that I couldn't just give up the chance."</p>

		<p>I smiled at her.  "For what it's worth, Daph, I think you made the right
		choice."</p>

		<p>"Thank you, Roz.  I think I did, too."  She looked up at me with a sly smile
		on her face.  "And now, Donny's free...."</p>

		<p>I smiled at her and took another sip.  "You know what, Daph?  I've been
		thinking about it, and I think I'm just fine where I am."</p>

		<p>She looked up at me, surprised.  "Roz, do you mean to tell me...."</p>

		<p>I gave a noncommittal smile.  "Maybe."  Just then, there was a knock on my
		door, and I knew absolutely who it was.  "Come on in, Frasier.  It's open."</p>

		<p>The door swung open, and there he was.  "When I saw your mother assaulting
		that poor biker, Daphne, I assumed that she hadn't caught you, so I was sure
		you'd be here."  He closed the door behind him.  "How are you?"</p>

		<p>She smiled at him.  "I'm fine, Doctor Crane.  I'm happy."</p>

		<p>He smiled back as he sat down beside me.  "So am I, Daphne.  So is he."</p>

		<p>She looked up, curiosity on her face.  "Where is he?"</p>

		<p>He sighed and leaned back into the cushions.  "I'm really not sure.  He said
		something about giving you time, and then he drove off."</p>

		<p>"And your father?"</p>

		<p>"If he's lucky, he's escaped Mel's party face and is safely at home."</p>

		<p>"My brothers?"</p>

		<p>"Touring the city.  Michael's got my cell phone, though, for whenever you
		want to talk to them."  She nodded, and I stared at him.  Frasier gave up
		his phone?  Had hell frozen over?  Whatever.</p>

		<p>"What about Mel?  You mentioned her earlier."</p>

		<p>Frasier sighed.  "She found out.  Or figured it out by the way Niles was
		gazing after you.  She threw quite a fit."</p>

		<p>Daphne cringed.  "And she left?"</p>

		<p>"Yes, Daphne, she left.  He was happy to see her go, though."</p>

		<p>Daphne grinned and nodded and then tried to get a few more mashed beets down
		Alice.</p>

		<p>Frasier turned to me.  "How are you, honey?  The last time I saw you were
		running down the street in a formal dress."</p>

		<p>I grinned.  "And would you believe that the dress survived?"</p>

		<p>"As long as we all fared better than that ill-fated biker, I'd say we're
		okay."</p>

		<p>I laughed and hit him on the shoulder.</p>

		<p>At that point, Daphne stood up and pulled off the towel, which was covered
		in stringed peas and beets.  "I think I'd better leave you two now.  There
		are people I... need to talk to."</p>

		<p>And then she ran out the door.</p>

		<p>"Maybe it's about time we started talking, Frasier."</p>

		<p>He smiled at me.  "I'm listening."</p>

		<h2 align="center">What Is A Boy To Do?</h2>

		<p>I couldn't help it.  When Doctor Crane go to Roz's apartment, I decided I
		had to give them some much-deserved time alone.</p>

		<p>Now, I stood in the blue foyer outside Niles' apartment, staring at the
		little stature that stands in the alcove on the wall.  Just my luck, he
		chose that moment to open the door.</p>

		<p>"Doctor -- Niles."</p>

		<p>He looked surprised.  "Daphne.  How long have you been standing here?"</p>

		<p>"Oh, not long," I lied.  "I just got off the elevator, in fact."</p>

		<p>I glanced at the elevator, which was currently on the top floor.  Oops.</p>

		<p>"I was with Roz, but then Frasier showed up.  I decided I should leave them
		alone, and I didn't know where else to go."</p>

		<p>He pulled the door open and ushered me inside.  "You're... always... welcome
		here, Daphne.  I suppose I've made that quite clear, though, haven't I?
		Perhaps suffocatingly so."  He smiled self-consciously as I sat down on the
		fainting couch.  He was wearing a silk dressing gown and holding a glass of
		champagne.</p>

		<p>"I thought you told me once that champagne was a drink for two."</p>

		<p>He smiled and looked down.  "I suppose I'd hoped you would come."</p>

		<p>"So."  I suddenly didn't know what to say.</p>

		<p>"Daphne, I've got an idea."  He glanced at his watch.  "It's three o'clock.
		If you wanted to get ready now, we could go to dinner tonight."</p>

		<p>I smiled shyly at him.  "Actually, Niles, I'd thought that maybe we could
		just stay here this afternoon and... talk.  And maybe cook dinner in."  I
		paused.  "Would that be all right?"</p>

		<p>He poured a glass for me and sat beside me on the fainting couch.  As I
		leaned against him, he draped his arm across my shoulders and sighed.  "That
		sounds perfect, Daphne.  Just perfect."</p>
