<!-- To Not Go Gentle \ The Cat Lands... A Little Battered And Bruised, But Otherwise Uninjured -->

<p>I stared at the phone.</p>

		<p>I couldn't believe I'd done it.</p>

		<p>I had the sudden urge to call him back. "Donny, I was just scared, forget what I said."</p>

		<p>But I couldn't, now.</p>

		<p>I'd broken our engagement.</p>

		<p>I jumped off the hot tin roof.</p>

		<p>I shuddered as I placed the telephone on the receiver, and I walked over and slumped down onto the piano bench.</p>

		<p>Doctor Crane chose that moment to walk out of the kitchen. "Daphne, are you all right?"</p>

		<p>I nodded mechanically. "Just fine."</p>

		<p>He looked at me critically. "Are you sure, Daphne? You know you can talk to me. I owe you that much after the way I've behaved."</p>

		<p>I smiled a bit sadly. "Yes, you do. But it's all right. I think I'd just like to be alone, to think."</p>

		<p>He nodded and sat down on the sofa.</p>

		<p>I glared at him. I had in mind a little more alone.</p>

		<p>He picked up the morning's newspaper, and I knew he had it in his mind to stay.</p>

		<p>So I left. I went out onto the balcony.</p>

		<p>Seattle's really beautiful by night. It's all aglow. And from Doctor Crane's balcony, you can see the Space Needle, which is quite a sight in the evening.</p>

		<p>The light from the living room glowed out onto the balcony in a little box, leaving just a bit in the edges, beyond the doors, shrouded in darkness.</p>

		<p>So, I sat in the shadow, away from the door, my back pressed against the side of the building, and looked up at the moon. It was full.</p>
