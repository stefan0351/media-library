<chapter>
	<p>Sam had feelings for Brooke for quite sometime now. But just recently
	she was able to completely admit to them and how much she did care
	for her. She saw it coming all along. They just kept growing stronger
	until she couldn't ignore them any longer. She was thinking a lot
	about her. Even went to seek her out if not just to pass by her in
	the halls at Kennedy High. Could it be anything else but love? She
	would be considered naïve even to herself if at this point she
	didn't
	admit to the feeling. Of course it wasn't something she would ever
	talk about with anyone, not even to one of her best friends, Lily.
	Sure she knew she would listen and even be supportive. But what was
	the sense it wasn't as if it was going to do any good to verbalize
	it. Sure it might make it more real, but was that actually a good
	thing? She would just have to try and put it out of her mind as best
	as she could. It doesn't help to have her sitting in the seat right
	beside her in class either. Other then that maybe Sam could just
	avoid seeing her all together. Maybe even transfer to another class?
	No the year was nearly ended. It wouldn't be too much longer. I guess
	it will be a little bit harder to avoid her since they are living in
	the same home. Why did her mother have to meet Brooke's father
	anyway? She could blame all these feelings on that situation, but she
	knew it started well before the move. She could sign up for the
	internship at a publication, maybe just far enough away to have to
	stay at least over the weeks? Sam jotted it down in her notepad. The
	blond next to her looked over to try and see what Sam was writing
	then up at her. Sam just smiled and closed her notebook. That was
	such a good idea. The only chance at seeing Brooke is on the weekend
	and she is hardly home then. It just might work or at least help. So
	that is the mission. </p>

	<p>After the bell rang Sam took off to the newspaper office to talk with
	Mr. Grant to see if there was anything available for her. She stepped
	into the office and got a smile from him. "Hi Sam." </p>

	<p>Sam smiled back "Mr. Grant can I talk to you a minute?" </p>

	<p>"Sure, Sam come on in" Sam entered the room completely and shut the
	door behind her.
	Mr. Grant motioned to the chair in front of his desk for Sam to sit
	down. </p>

	<p>Sam started "Mr. Grant you know how I am now the `editor and
	chief'
	right?" Quoting his very words a few short months ago. Mr. Grant just
	nodded his head. Sam continued "I was wondering if there was any
	openings at any publishing firm for an intern? It would be a good
	experience for me and just think what I could bring to the school
	paper next year." Mr. Grant smiled again. </p>

	<p>"Yes Sam that would be a great idea. Are you sure you want to though?
	It would take up a lot of your summer hours?" Sam nodded. Mr. Grant
	continued "I'll make a few phone calls for you. I expect you would
	want something close by." He started making a few notes on a pad. </p>

	<p>Sam spoke up saying, "Well I don't want to limit myself. If there is
	something a little further away I think I might be able to do that."
	Sam really wanted to get further then the next town away. That would
	defeat the whole purpose.</p>

	<p>As she left she thought that it was going to solve everything. A
	whole couple of months without Brooke right in front of her all the
	time. It might just be the thing to let Brooke and her feelings for
	her out of her mind, finally. Or, at least fade to a dull roar.
	Sam figured that until she has an assignment or at least the option
	for an assignment she wouldn't mention it. </p>

	<p>Sam arrived home with the house empty. Her mother and Mike were still
	at work and Brooke was at cheerleader practice. It was fine really
	she just wanted a little quiet anyway. Of course, instead of doing
	something productive such as homework or even an article for the
	paper. She walked up the stairs and headed into the room of the
	blonde's that she was so infatuated with. When she entered the room
	she walked around looking at all the little things on the desk at
	first. Picking up a cute little stuffed Valentine Bunny and
	remembered it was from Josh. She looked at the picture that was of
	Brooke and herself. She picked up the picture and gently ran her
	finger down the side of her face. As she remembered the day the
	photograph was taken. </p>

	<hr/>

	<p>They were washing Mike's car, it was right after her mother and her
	moved into the McQueen household. They wanted to make a family day,
	so that is what they ended up doing. Brooke had these really short
	jean shorts on and just a plan tank top. She was gorgeous to say the
	least. The sun seemingly making her blonde hair a lighter blonde, the
	water was glistening off her exposed skin. The thighs very toned,
	must be from the cheerleading workouts. </p>

	<hr/>

	<p>The thoughts making it a little stuffy in Brooke's room. As she was
	leaving the room she was thinking, hopefully these thoughts will all
	be behind her after her time away from here. Just as the door clicked
	shut in her room as she shut it Sam heard the car pull up. Looking at
	her watch seeing it was just about the time Brooke would be coming
	home. </p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Later that week at the dinner table Brooke started talking about
	Harrison. How they went to the Mall and had this great time. Brooke
	would glance over to Sam occasionally, so Sam had to at least fake a
	few smiles at the supposedly funny things they did together that
	day.  Sam was still hoping that her plan was going to work because
	she wasn't sure how much of this she would be able to take. After
	finishing talking to Jane about the day Brooke looked at Sam.</p>

	<p> "Sam, Harrison wants you to call him. He mentioned something about a
	question on Geometry I think." </p>

	<p>"Sure. Actually I think I'll do that right now." She was all done
	eating and was relieved she was able to get away from all this
	pleasant conversation about her love interest and one of her best
	friends. It was making her ill.</p>

	<p>Sam dialed Harrison's number and waited for him to pick up. She heard
	Brooke coming up the stairs and looked up at her open doorway. Brooke
	leaned against the doorjamb.</p>

	<p>Speaking to Brooke "Do you mind?" pointing at the phone. </p>

	<p>Finally she heard Harrison's "Hello?" Brooke just shrugged and left
	as Sam stood to shut the door. After all he did say for her to call. </p>

	<p>Sam spoke into the phone "Hey, you wanted to ask about Geometry?" </p>

	<p>"Oh, Hi Sam. Actually it isn't about Geometry at all. What I wanted
	to ask you was, you and Brooke are kind of getting along now right?" </p>

	<p>"Yeah, kind of."</p>

	<p>"Our one month anniversary is next week and I was wondering if I
	should get her a bracelet I spotted in the Mall today? I was thinking
	I would get it engraved, but I'm not sure what to say. You know?"
	This conversation was just getting her aggravated. She was trying to
	convince herself that she will just have to learn to deal with things
	like this. It will happen, a lot, knowing Brooke. </p>

	<p>Harrison continued "I would like to know if 'our hearts together,
	forever' would be to weird or to assuming? What I am asking you
	really is, has she said anything about me in the caring slash like
	slash love area?" The last few words, coming out in a rush. </p>

	<p>She wanted so much to be calm with her response but failed
	miserably. "How am I supposed to know? Why would you think Brooke
	would talk to me about you? I don't even want to know what she thinks
	about you." Sam paused for a second. Smoothing out her pants with the
	palm of her hand as she tried to calm herself. "Look Harrison, I'm
	sorry I guess I just had a bad day and I'm taking it out on you. Let
	me think about it and I'll talk to you tomorrow okay?" </p>

	<p>"Yeah, I guess." Sounding a little bit confused.</p>

	<p>After Sam hung up the phone she felt real awful and thought she had
	some apologizing to do. It wasn't fair to him. It was only in her own
	mind and she shouldn't take it out on Harrison. </p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Sam was walking down the hall with Lily when Mr. Grant approached
	them. Sam was hoping that he wouldn't talk about the internship with
	Lily right with her but she was also looking forward to hearing
	whether there was any openings or not. </p>

	<p>"Well Sam, it looks like there are a few internships you would be
	perfect for. Some even said after looking over your experience, you
	were just what they were looking for." Mr. Grant said with a smile.
	Lily looking over at Sam with a curious look. </p>

	<p>"That's great," Sam replied a bit uncomfortable.</p>

	<p>"How about stopping by my office after school today? There was one
	from as far away as San Francisco." Now Lily was wide mouth but
	stayed silent.</p>

	<p>"Sounds good Mr. Grant I'll stop by then." Even knowing she was going
	to have to deal with Lily right beside her, she couldn't stop the
	huge smile that grew on her face especially when she heard San
	Francisco mentioned. Without even knowing what the position was going
	to be she knew that was going to be the one she chose. So far away
	she wouldn't even be able to come back on weekends. Perhaps a few.
	Now that Mr. Grant was gone Lily spoke up.</p>

	<p>"Sam, what was he talking about? You're taking an internship? And
	what is this about San Francisco?" </p>

	<p>"I applied for an internship to get more experience. I was trying to
	get ahead of things. You know it would look great on college
	applications and such. It's what I want to do with my life why not
	start early?" Hoping she would forget about the San Francisco part. </p>

	<p>"But Sam what about this San Francisco distance?" No such luck. "It
	seems kind of far even for experience. Your mother it letting you go?
	Is it all summer?" </p>

	<p>"I didn't want to limit myself with distance." Giving the same
	line
	to Lily as she did to Mr. Grant just days ago. "And no, I didn't
	get
	to talk to my mother about it yet. I wanted to see if I got any
	offers first."  </p>

	<p>Lily kind of smiled "Oh, and how are you going to convince her to
	allow you to go that far. This is something I would love to listen
	too."</p>

	<p>"Lily, it's not like I am defiantly going that far, it is just one of
	my options." Knowing this was a lie, because she had already
	decided. "I've got a few ideas to approach it with her though."
	Smiling as they started walking to class again. Now the tough task,
	to convince her mother. Lily is right it will be some tough task, but
	if anyone can talk her into letting her go it was Sam.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Sitting next to Brooke in Biology class Sam was a little anxious to
	say the least. She could hardly wait to see what her options actually
	were. Although being this close to Brooke was a pleasant way to pass
	the time. As Mr./Ms Glass spoke at the front of the room Sam was
	distracted by how Brooke was tapping her pencil as she stared towards
	the front. Although it didn't look like she was paying any attention
	to the subject at hand. Well, neither was Sam for that matter. Sam
	realizing she must have been staring a bit too long because the
	blonde turned to look in her direction. Sam quickly diverted her eyes
	to the front. Brooke leaned over and whispered.</p>

	<p>"I see you find this as interesting as I do." </p>

	<p>"Yeah, I am completely engrossed in the Biological Rhythms and their
	24 hour cycle." with a quiet sarcastic reply. Both girls laughed
	quietly. Although not quiet enough. Mr./Ms Glass turned to look in
	their direction. </p>

	<p>"What has made such a response come from the ever so popular Miss
	Mcqueen and oh.let's say not so popular Miss Mcpherson?" Waiting
	a
	moment for a response, seeing she was getting none continued. </p>

	<p>"Ladies," looking around the room, "class, there is nothing funny
	about Biological Rhythms" once again speaking directly to Brooke and
	Sam "would it be alright with you both if I continue with the lesson"
	not bothering to wait for a response walked back to the chalkboard.
	As the class went on it wasn't any more exciting then before the
	welcome interruption. Sam found herself thinking about the evening
	before.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Watching Brooke's hand brought back all of the feelings of the night
	before. Sam was sitting at the kitchen table doing her homework. She
	must have been really concentrating on the paper because she didn't
	hear Brooke come in the door. The first thing she knew there was
	hands on her shoulders. Jumping a foot off her chair while she looked
	to see whom it was. Seeing it was Brooke didn't do a thing for her
	nervous system. With the hands on her shoulders Sam tensed right up. </p>

	<p>"You should relax a little Sam, it couldn't be good to be this
	tense." Brooke was oblivious to what her hands were doing to Sam. She
	could not take it any longer, she stood and turned towards Brooke.
	Sam had to do something, choosing the thing she does best. </p>

	<p>"What is it to ya?" Before packing up her papers she looked directly
	at Brooke and saw a mix between hurt and anger?</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Sam was jarred out of her thoughts by Brooke elbowing her to respond
	to Glass. The teacher was glaring at her and practically tapping her
	foot. </p>

	<p>"Since Mcpherson doesn't feel the need for any verbal skills
	I will
	hand out the assignment for the weekend." Taking some papers off
	her
	desk and walking around the room to hand the sheets out while talking
	to the class. "Some of you are well aware of temperatures.
	Some,"
	looking directly at Nicole "know all about cool, even cold, and
	some
	here," directing it at the class as a whole "know about the
	warmer
	temperatures of an adolescent hormonal teenager. You will have a
	partner and take each of your temperatures throughout the day. Taking
	the temperatures twice in the morning, twice in the afternoon, and
	how many times in the evening class?" A few students responded
	with "twice" mumbled. "Very good class. Lets see, how
	will I make the
	partners up, hmmm, how about your usual Lab partners." Smiling,
	knowing that the alphabetized seating arrangements were to the
	students distaste anyhow. Which meant Sam's partner would be the
	one
	who would make her temperature erratic if not down right heated,
	Brooke. Each set of two got handed a thermometer strip. The
	assignment was to be done on either Saturday, or Sunday, whichever
	day suited each.  </p>

	<hr/>

	<p>As she left the cashier's counter she looked around the
	cafeteria,
	finding the one she had talk too. After last night's conversation
	she
	knew she had to smooth things over with Harrison. As she approached
	his table he spotted her and started to stand to leave. </p>

	<p>"Hold on a sec Harrison. Can I talk to you a minute?" Giving
	him a
	pleading look.</p>

	<p>"Gee Sam, do you think you can do that without biting my head
	off?"
	Seeming reticent toward her.</p>

	<p>"Please Harrison, let me make it up to you for my inconsideration
	of
	your feelings. I was thinking about what you asked me." Hoping to
	peak his interest to relinquish his anger toward her, enough to
	listen further. She could see through his eyes clicking about trying
	to figure whether to let it go. "Instead of our `hearts
	together,
	forever' what about `always yours' to show her your
	devotion? Then
	you don't have to show any assumption." That seemed to do the
	trick.</p>

	<p>"That actually sounds great! I knew a journalist would be able to
	help me find the right words." Smiling up at her. </p>

	<p>"And I am sorry for going off on you last night. Are we still
	friends?" </p>

	<p>"The best, buds forever Sam." She returned the smile. </p>

	<hr/>

	<p>After school Sam entered Mr. Grant's office he was finishing up
	with
	a phone call. He reached for a folder while Sam sat down in the chair
	opposite him. Opening the folder in front of him as he placed the
	phone onto the receiver, he looked up to Sam. </p>

	<p>"Sam, I told you I had a few options for you and I'll let you
	take a
	look at them." Taking a few sheets out of the folder, passing
	them to
	her. "There are two magazines and three newspapers." Sam
	riffled
	through them seeking out the one from San Francisco. Trying to be
	patient, she would pause at each one. And there it was, moving it to
	the top of the stack. The magazine was called `Barrier
	Magazine'. "There is some samples of each one. You can take
	these
	home and let me know which ones you are interested in and we can go
	into a little more detail then. How about we meet back here,"
	looking
	at his schedule "let's say Tuesday?" Waiting for
	conformation from
	Sam.
	"Sure," getting out of the chair to leave "I'll read
	all through
	these and I'll see you Tuesday."</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>While Sam was sitting on her bed she was reading over all the
	internships Mr. Grant had given her. What Sam didn't really notice in
	Mr. Grant's office was that the San Franciscan Barrier magazine was a
	lesbian magazine. She thought how appropriate. Sam jumped and slid
	the magazine she was looking at into the stack of papers from Mr.
	Grant when she heard a knock on the bathroom door. Not waiting for a
	response Brooke peering around the door into Sam's room. </p>

	<p>"When do you want to start Glass's assignment?"</p>

	<p>"Now, I guess." Swinging her legs over the side of the bed to stand.
	Taking the stack of papers with her and placed them on the corner of
	her desk. Brooke eyed the stack Sam put on the desk but didn't
	say
	anything about it. They both walked into the adjoining bathroom.</p>

	<p>"I'll just go get the thermometer." Sam couldn't help but notice the
	departing form. Her hips swaying as she walked. Brooke re-entered the
	bathroom. [[ God, she is so beautiful.]] </p>

	<p>Brooke's fingers touched her face as she placed the strip across her
	forehead. Sam did her best to stop the shiver from the touch. "Are my
	finger cold?" But to Sam they were as hot as the sun on her face on a
	late spring afternoon. "Some." Brooke was holding the thermometer on
	while waiting for it to rise. She moved one of her hands to brush
	back Sam's hair. She moved her hand to the back of her neck lifting
	her hair up. "Maybe sometime I could put your hair up or something.
	You have such thick full hair." Sam pulled her head away.</p>

	<p>"Maybe." As she pulled away the thermometer strip fluttered to the
	floor. She bent down to pick it up off the floor at the same time
	Brooke was. Their hands touched as they both reached it
	simultaneously. The time seemed to go in slow motion as Brooke picked
	up the strip in one hand and wrapped her fingers gently, barely a
	touch around Sam's hand. Bringing them both to a standing
	position.</p>

	<p>"What is the matter lately Sam? You have been incredibly jumpy.
	Is
	their something going on that you would like to talk about?"
	Placing
	her hand on top of Sam's and flipping it over to place the strip
	onto
	the open palm. Sam's eyes were bouncing back and forth between
	her
	hands and Brooke's face. Knowing she had to make some sort of
	response. </p>

	<p>"Umm, no, . I mean, nothing that I need to discuss with
	you." Seeing
	the disappointment on Brooke's face from what she just said tried
	to
	correct it. "I just have something's on my mind. That's
	all." Pulling
	her hand from the soft gently ones, immediately missing the touch.</p>

	<p>"I thought we have gotten closer, friends even. I must have been
	wrong." Dropping her hands to her sides. "We should do the
	temperature assignment." </p>

	<p>"Brooke, I'm.." Brooke interrupted.</p>

	<p>" Sam, let's just do this." Focusing on the strip in
	Sam's hand. </p>

	<p>The rest of the day was just do the task and be done with it. Sam
	felt bad about it but she wasn't going to discuss her feelings
	for
	her with her that would be just ridiculous. It wasn't like Sam to
	confront her feelings and discuss them to resolve them. That would be
	way too simple. </p>

	<p>Once when Sam was holding the strip onto Brooke's forehead Brooke
	closed her eyes. Sam took the opportunity to study the features of
	her face. Starting with the cute little nose that was twitching as if
	to scratch an unseen itch. Going to the delectable lips of hers. They
	were in-between cherry and strawberry color as juicy looking as
	either. Licking her lips Sam raised her eyes to find Brooke's
	opened
	staring back at her. Clearing her throat before quickly looking at
	the temperature and calling it out. Sam removed the strip and placing
	it on the sink and jotted it down on the sheet. Willing her hands not
	to shake. Sam looking up at Brooke was starting to say that that was
	the last of assignment changed it to. "What?" After a huge
	half-
	cocked smile was across Brooke's face. </p>

	<p>"Oh, nothing. Nothing at all Sam." Practically humming before
	departing through the door to her bedroom. Sam stood there trying to
	stop the panic before it hit. Not a chance. </p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Sunday afternoon the house was empty except for Sam's mother and
	herself. Brooke was out with Nicole and Mike was away for the
	afternoon on Business. Sam found her mother alone in the kitchen. </p>

	<p>"Mom, can I talk to you?" As she walked to the table near
	where Jane
	was working on dinner. </p>

	<p>"Of course, honey." She stopped what she was chopping and
	turned to
	give Sam her undivided attention. "Is there something wrong?"
	Sam sat
	down.</p>

	<p>"No, nothing is wrong." All of the rehearsing she did
	didn't make it
	any easier to start. "I have been thinking about my future
	lately.
	And what better way of promoting it then getting an intern
	position?" </p>

	<p>"Yes, sounds like a very responsible thing for you to do for your
	future. Do you have one in mind?" </p>

	<p>"I do but, it's in San Francisco." Continuing before her
	mother could
	say anything. " That's only six hours away. Less, if you fly.
	It
	would be a great maturing experience." Her mother was shaking her
	head. "I am practically an adult, don't you trust me? This
	would be
	an opportunity that only a few get." </p>

	<p>"I don't think so Sam." Still not getting the response
	that she
	needed for the `get off Brooke mission' she tried again. </p>

	<p>"Think of how good it will look on my college applications. It
	could
	mean a partial or even full scholarship. You will have two going off
	to college the same year. Those bills could mount up easily. So let
	me help you?" </p>

	<p>"Well, your cousin Chris does live there. I could make a call to
	him
	and discuss if it would be all right for you to stay with him."</p>

	<p>"Thanks Mom!" Kissing her on the cheek on her way back up to
	her
	room. She went up the stairs with a little more jump in her step She
	was well on way to San Francisco and in turn with Brooke on the way
	out of her thoughts, dreams, and life. </p>

	<hr/>

	<p>"I heard mom and dad talking about you going away for a little
	while?
	What did you do?" Brooke asked from the doorway. </p>

	<p>"It was by my choice." Turning toward the voice at the door.</p>

	<p>"What do you mean by that?" Brooke took a few steps into the
	room.</p>

	<p>"Oh, don't go buy another makeup case to fill the empty
	space. I'll
	be back in a little over a month." Brooke scowled at that. [[God,
	even her scowl is cute.]]  "Sorry," shrugging "I am
	trying to get an
	internship and in looks like it may be up in San Francisco."
	[[Was
	that sadness? No, what my eyes will see.]] </p>

	<p>"Well, that's great Sam!" Sam took it as Brooke
	wouldn't mind at all
	if she was gone for a while. She turned back to her desk, not wanting
	to see anymore `good riddance expression'.</p>

	<p>"Yeah, so I'll be out of your hair."</p>

	<p>"Sam." Brooke speaking to her back now.
	"Brooke if you don't mind I need to get this paper written
	for school
	in the morning." It was a moment before Sam heard the footsteps
	retreat.</p>

	<p>Sighing to herself after she knew she was alone again. Speaking
	outloud in a whisper "Oh boy, I sure hope that is long
	enough." </p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Sam had just ironed out all the details of her internship with Mr.
	Grant. So, she was on cloud nine walking down the hall when she heard
	some voices being raised. She rounded the corned and saw Brooke and
	Harrison talking at her locker. </p>

	<p>"But Brooke, what do you mean?" </p>

	<p>"I'm sorry, I just don't think you should be giving me
	this. I don't
	think we should see each other any longer." He asked in a
	saddened
	voice.</p>

	<p>"Why? I thought everything was going so well?"</p>

	<p>"I don't feel that way about you Harrison." Taking in a
	breath. "I
	care for someone else. I love someone else. I have for quite sometime
	now." A bit of anger in his voice.</p>

	<p>"Who? You never gave any indication of that!" Brooke sighed.</p>

	<p>"It doesn't matter. Nothing will ever come of it. Just know
	that I do
	care for you. But, to let you keep hoping that this is something
	it's
	not. It's just not fair to you or to me." You could really
	hear the
	anger and hurt in his voice.</p>

	<p>"But, you love this other guy! If it could never be why not let
	this"
	waving his hand back and forth in-between her and his chest
	"happen.
	It can work." Brooke held up her hand to stop him from continuing.</p>

	<p>"No Harrison, it will never work. I'm sorry." Leaving him
	at the
	lockers with his own thoughts and pain. He watched her disappear
	around the corner then he hung his head and left. </p>

	<hr/>

	<p>After school let out Sam was preparing to leave for San Francisco
	within a few short days. Brooke walked into Sam's room while she was
	packing up a few items.</p>

	<p>"Mom and Dad want you downstairs." She didn't give her any idea of
	whether it was bad or good news. </p>

	<p>"Okay." She put down the shirt she was folding and started
	downstairs, Brooke followed behind. As Sam made her way into the
	kitchen her mother and Mike were sitting at the table. Brooke made
	her way around Sam and slipped into the other room. </p>

	<p>"Brooke said you wanted to see me?" Looking at one then the other.
	They both looked past her with smiles growing on their faces as they
	watched Brooke re-enter the room with a large wrapped box in her
	hands. It was wrapped with white paper with violets pictured all over
	it. Brooke smiled as she set it down on the table directly in front
	of Sam.</p>

	<p>"Go ahead, open it." All that Sam could see at that moment was the
	perfect smile that went so well with those perfect eyes. She
	hesitated a moment mesmerized by the sight before tearing into the
	wrapping paper.</p>

	<p>"We figured since you are investing your time and energy into your
	education over the summer. That we should invest something to help
	you." As her mother said this she was noticing that as the paper was
	pealed away there was a laptop underneath. Sam was at a loss for
	words.</p>

	<p>"Oh my. wow. This is.. I mean.. It isn't even my
	birthday." She
	looked up at them all. "Thank you! This will be so helpful." She
	quickly went around the table and squeezed Mike and Jane one in each
	arm. Telling each 'thank you' again. Jane was laughing around the hug
	saying.</p>

	<p>"It was actually Brooke's idea. She contributed to it as well." As
	she returned to the other side on the table Sam was thinking 'I even
	have a legitimate excuse to hug her, oh boy my lucky day'. She
	stepped into Brooke's arms. [[I could stay here forever.]] Sam hugged
	her as she saw fit for a stepsister to hug. When Sam released her
	Brooke held a few seconds longer, which Sam didn't mind at all. </p>

	<p>"Thank you to you as well then." Brooke shyly looked down as she
	replied. </p>

	<p>"Your welcome."</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Sam's mother had to work as well as Mike so Brooke was elected to
	take her to the airport. They were waiting silently in the airport
	when the announcement came for Sam's flight for San Francisco can now
	begin boarding. Brooke spoke first.</p>

	<p>"Well, that's you." She said it sadly, which considering all the
	fighting and arguing from the past Sam would figure that she would
	see relief to be rid of her more then sadness. </p>

	<p>"Yup, that it is." They both stood. Sam, trying to arrange her
	carryon over her shoulder. Brooke helped her lift it onto her
	shoulder seeing she was having some difficulty with it. </p>

	<p>"Have a good flight. Will you call when you get settled?" That was
	one of Jane's requests when they left this morning. </p>

	<p>"And you'll call to let us know how you are doing." She said more of
	a demand then a request. She drew Sam quickly into a warm embrace.
	Brooke whispered into her ear barely loud enough for Sam to hear. </p>

	<p>"I will miss you." It was so surprising to hear Sam didn't think
	before she asked.</p>

	<p>"You will?" They separated a little so Brooke could look directly
	into Sam's eyes. </p>

	<p>"Of course I will! We may fight but I still care for you!"</p>

	<p>"Thank you Brooke. I will miss you too!" Smiling from hearing such an
	unexpected comment from Brooke she was completely off guard when she
	felt a gently kiss on her cheek. Brooke gave her one more quick
	squeeze before allowing her so make her way to the line to get on the
	airplane. As Sam was in line she waved bye while thinking 'I will
	never wash this cheek again." The smile that was plastered on her
	face didn't disappear until well on her way to San Francisco. </p>

	<p>The flight went by quickly. She walked off the plane watching all the
	faces greeting the departing passengers. She didn't see her cousin in
	years but as soon as she did see his face she knew it was he. He
	greeted her with open arms. Bringing her into a tight hug.</p>

	<p>"Hello Sam! It has been a long time. You were so young the last time
	I saw you." Separating to take a look at her with his hands on her
	shoulders. "You have grown into a beautiful young lady didn't you?"
	Smiling as he grabbed her carryon and threw it over his shoulder.
	They walked with the rest of the passengers to go retrieve her
	baggage. </p>

	<p>Chris drove into San Francisco where she will be staying for the next
	few weeks. While sitting in the driver's seat he turned to Sam. </p>

	<p>"I'll swing by where you will be working on our way to my place."</p>

	<p>"Sounds good. I appreciate you letting me stay here with you. You
	don't know how much it means to me."</p>

	<p>"It is not a problem. I am looking forward getting to know you again.
	When we get to my place you will have to tell me all about how your
	mother is doing." </p>

	<p>They arrived at Chris's place. It was a small apartment with two
	bedrooms, and a kitchen and sitting room combination. It was neat but
	with a lived in look to it. He showed her where she would be staying
	and left to let her settle in and unpack. After Sam was unpacked she
	joined her cousin at the table in the kitchen.</p>

	<p>"Would you like a soda or something?"</p>

	<p>"No, thanks, I'm fine." After a moment of quiet he spoke
	to her.</p>

	<p>"So, Jane tells me you moved in with her boyfriend. Mike is
	it?" Sam
	nodded. " And his daughter?"</p>

	<p>"Yeah, Mike is a real nice guy. He's very good to mom and me.
	We live
	in what I like to call `the palace'." She half laughed
	"It's very
	extravagant from what we're used to, you know?" There was no
	need to
	pretend with him. She trusted him very much remembering him from her
	past. "His daughter, Brooke is the same age and is in the same
	grade
	as I am."</p>

	<p>"What is she like? Are you friends?" Sam laughed at that.</p>

	<p>"When I first moved in we were at each other's throats. We
	hated each
	other from school really. But just recently we seem to be getting
	along okay." </p>

	<p>"And you like her?" Sam avoided the question.</p>

	<p>"She is very bright and beautiful. She could be a model if she
	wanted
	to. She's also a cheerleader." Repeating his question.</p>

	<p>"And you like her, a lot?" Sam was going to start to deny it
	when he
	added "Your eyes tell the story." </p>

	<p>"Yes but, she doesn't even see me, really." Sam confirmed
	sadly. He
	looked at her with supportive caring eyes.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>A couple of weeks into her stay the phone rang.</p>

	<p>"Sam, it's for you." She put down the papers she was
	working with and
	took the phone. </p>

	<p>"Hello?"
	"Hey, it's me." Brooke spoke on the other end. Chris sat
	in his
	chair, occasionally watching the animated expressions that Sam gave
	off while speaking on the phone.</p>

	<p>"Hi Brooke." With a cheeriness in her voice. </p>

	<p>"Mom wanted to see how you are and if there was anything you
	needed."
	Sam sat back in her chair to get comfortable.</p>

	<p>"I am doing great. Chris is treating me well." Smiling at
	Chris as he
	looked up from his book he was reading. "I can't think of
	anything I
	really need right now. But I'll call if I do. My internship is
	going
	great too. They are all very nice people. There is so much there it
	becomes overwhelming at times. But, I am sure it will all calm down.
	I brought a few articles I worked on when I was home and they like
	some of them. They were thinking of running them in the magazine next
	month."</p>

	<p>"That's great Sam!" She sounded as excited as Sam was.
	"I don't
	remember you mentioning which magazine you were working at. What was
	it again?" Sam purposely didn't mention the name in case
	anyone got
	an idea to pick one up. But she was just working there. It didn't
	matter that much anymore.</p>

	<p>"It's called Barrier. Hey, so what has been happening there
	since I
	have been away?" Hoping the change in subject would make the name
	of
	the magazine be forgotten. </p>

	<p>"Actually I have some exciting news myself. You know the
	cheerleader
	competition we were in?" Continuing after Sam's
	"Yeah." "Well, we
	have one more regional meet this Wednesday night. If we win we go to
	the State finals. Which just so happens to be up where you are, in
	San Francisco!" </p>

	<p>"Great!" Trying to remember what ever happened to the
	`Get off Brooke
	mission'. After they hung up. </p>

	<p>"Chris, when I came up here I had thought 400 miles away from
	Brooke
	would be enough to get over her and move on with my life. I was
	hoping it would be enough time before I had to go back and see her
	again. She just told me she might be coming up here for some
	cheerleader competition. That's only if they win the regionals
	this
	week." Putting the book down he gave Sam his full attention.</p>

	<p>"Maybe she won't win?" Giving some hope for her. "If
	not, maybe it
	would be best for you to confront her about it. Maybe with you out of
	your home environment it will help you. I think she should stay right
	here." The way it was said Sam couldn't really object and
	besides it
	doesn't sound so far off. </p>

	<p>"If they get into the State finals I'll tell her then,
	okay?" He just
	nodded and picked his book back up to continue reading.</p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Sam picked up the phone after the second ring. "Hello?"</p>

	<p>"Hi Sam, guess what?" Not waiting for a reply. "We won!
	We are in the
	finals!" Sam heard such excitement in her voice she couldn't
	help
	catch in herself.</p>

	<p>"That's great, Brooke! When are they being held?"</p>

	<p>"Two weeks from this Saturday. It's going to be at USF."</p>

	<p>After they hung up Sam thought no matter how far or how long she
	stays away from Brooke her feelings have yet to diminish or even
	abate. It is looking like she is going to have to live with this
	infatuation for some time to come. </p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Both Sam and Chris met Brooke at the airport. Brooke embraced Sam
	first before looking towards Chris. Sam introduced them and Brooke
	reached out her hand which Chris took with a cordial handshake. </p>

	<p>"Sam, you are right she is beautiful." Chris was totally
	oblivious to
	the embarrassment he has caused Sam, picked up the luggage from
	Brooke. </p>

	<p>"Thank you," looking over at Sam "Both". Sam hoped
	her cheeks weren't
	showing to drastically. But somehow she knew they were as red as
	stoplights, which seem plentiful in the city. Brooke hooked her arm
	through Sam's as they walked through the airport to leave. </p>

	<hr/>

	<p>Brooke stormed in the apartment a day after her arrival. "We are in
	the top five squads!" Brooke marched right up to Sam and gave her
	a
	hug. "I'll just go change." She gave Sam one more quick hug with a
	squeal "Isn't that just fantastic?" Sam watched the departing form
	completely stunned. </p>

	<p>"You don't see it? Are you blind? For being such a bright girl you
	can be obtuse!" The cousin spoke after seeing the interaction between
	the two. </p>

	<p>"What do you mean?" She sat at the table opposite her cousin. Trying
	to recover from the warm embrace she leaned an elbow on the table in
	front of her. Missing the first attempt. </p>

	<p>"For god sake, she called you all the time. She talks about you when
	you aren't around like you are the greatest, funniest, and the most
	brilliant thing around. She has even spoke about you being
	beautiful." </p>

	<p>"She did?"</p>

	<p>"Yes, she did." He spoke a little softer. "You know before she came
	here the way your eyes lit up every time you spoke of her I thought
	she must know how you feel. Then she arrived and she looks at you the
	same way I couldn't believe you each don't see it." </p>

	<p>"Okay, I'll try and talk to her about it the next chance I
	get."
	Looking a little defeated. </p>

	<p>---------------------</p>

	<p>When Brooke entered the apartment she was radiating energy and
	excitement when Sam saw her. Brooke immediately went to Sam bringing
	her into a huge hug. "We won!" Sam thought Brooke smelled
	like
	gardenias. "Can you believe it?" As they were hugging their faces
	were right up close to each other. Sam spoke in a small
	voice. "Brooke" taking a swallow "I have something I need
	to talk to
	you about." After seeing Sam's seriousness her face took on a
	seriousness of it's own. Sam moved back away from Brooke.</p>

	<p>"I have to tell you this. Although this may not be the most
	appropriate time but..it has become of the utmost importance of
	the
	moment. It may not even be the best thing to say and if I lose all
	that I care about so be it."</p>

	<p>"What is it Sam." Giving Sam her undivided attention.</p>

	<p>Stepping around the room just short of pacing with her head down.
	"I
	have come up here to get away from something." Saying this
	wringing
	her hands. "This thing is difficult to deal with but I have no
	choice
	but to confront this. As bad as it sounds this thing is you. Please
	don't say anything." Stopping to look at Brooke and put her
	hand up
	with the gesture to stop. "It's not because of disliking you
	but the
	complete opposite." Looking everywhere but at the cheerleader
	while
	saying the rest. "I have come to realize, not so recently I might
	add," with a partial laugh "I care for you a little too much,
	actually way too much. I wanted to let you know." </p>

	<p>"You took off to run from me?" Sam nodded. "When all you
	had to do
	was talk to me to find out the truth." Now it was Brooke's
	turn to
	look at the floor.</p>

	<p>"Truth?" Sam asked trying to get Brooke's eye. </p>

	<p>"The truth is I have felt for you for so long and I couldn't
	have
	hoped that you had felt the same too." Looking up at Sam with a
	smile
	that was mirrored on Sam's. </p>

	<p>Sam tentatively took the few steps closer before she was just inches
	away from Brooke. Reaching her hand up Sam slipped the back of her
	fingers over the softness of Brooke's cheek. Brooke's eyes
	closed to
	the touch. Sam leaned in to the lips that have occupied her thoughts
	for what seemed like an eternity. The first instance their lips
	touched was completely blissful for both. Brooke's hands reaching
	up
	to Sam's waist. That kiss was mixed with tears of overwhelming
	joyful
	relief. Their lips touched again and again until they joined as one.
	Sam's fingers slide back around Brooke's neck. Sam's lips
	parted to
	welcome the velvet that was Brooke's tongue. It could only be heaven
	to finally be with whom she cared for deeply and with her whole self.
	Sam pulled back hearing a small whimper from Brooke as their lips
	separated and looked into the beautiful blonde's eyes as she
	spoke. "I am so glad we had this talk." Smiling "Brooke I
	love you, I
	have for so very long I have been in torment over you." A tear
	rolled
	down Brooke's cheek </p>

	<p>"You don't know how I have wanted to hear that from you
	because I
	feel the same way. I love you, Sam with my whole being." Brooke
	replied before leaning into the delectable lips. Sam was full of
	thoughts of the future and what it held for both of them together.</p>
