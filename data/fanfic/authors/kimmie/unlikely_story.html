<p>Brooke lay in the hospital bed staring at the ceiling,
wishing that none of this had ever happened.  A tear rolled down her
cheek and she closed her eyes.  Her father, Jane and Sam walked
through the door and over to where she lay.</p>
<p>'Hi honey'  Her father smiled and kissed her cheek.  'What's
wrong, are you okay?'</p>
<p>'This is awful... what am I going to do Dad?'  Brooke asked,
wide eyed.</p>
<p>Jane cut in seeing the need for some comfort:</p>
<p>'Don't worry Brooke we'll get you home and you can rest.'</p>
<p>Sam rolled her eyes:</p>
<p>'God she only sprained her ankle, give it a rest already!'
she sat down on the edge of the bed and gave an exasperated sigh.</p>
<p>'Sam!' Jane scolded.</p>
<p>'I can't practice Sam, you may not think what I do is
important but it is to me, okay?'  Brooke growled back at the
brunette.  Sam just looked away.  'Can we go now Dad?'  Brooke said
not taking her eyes off the other girl.</p>

<hr>

<p>Brooke lay on the couch trying to watch television but not
having the patience to concentrate.  Sam walked in and sat in a chair
nearby and looked at the carpet.  Brooke looked at her in confusion
and waited to see why Sam had come in.</p>
<p>'I'm sorry okay!'  Sam eventually stated feeling Brooke's
gaze upon her.</p>
<p>'Oh'  Brooke replied simply</p>
<p>'Yeah, and I figure I have to seen as how we're gonna have to
spend the next couple of days together.'</p>
<p>'What?'  Brooke asked genuinly confused.</p>
<p>'You mean they haven't told you... well... crap... they're
going away... work or something-it couldn't be put off.  So I have
the responsibility of looking after your royal highness.'  Sam
responded, not looking all to happy.</p>
<p>'No... no way! You must be kidding...'  </p>

<hr>

<p>'Okay, I'll see you guys later'  Sam half smiled.</p>
<p>'Okay sweetie' Jane smiled back.</p>
<p>'Bye Brooke.'  There was no answer.  Brooke had spent the
most part of last night arguing with her father about her being left
with Sam, although she didn't exactly refer to Sam with that name,
but several others instead.  The night had ended with Brooke not
talking to anybody. </p>
<p>'Sam... try and be nice, okay?'  Jane asked her daughter.
Sam sighed but nodded in return:</p>
<p>'I'll do my best.'  She watched as they drove away, standing
for a second outside before she went back into the house.  She stood
in the hall and looked into the living room where Brooke had been
laying since that morning.  Brooke couldn't really walk around by
herself because to get her ankle better she would have to let it rest
completely.  That meant she had to rely on others but at the moment
really didn't want to.  Sam cautiously walked into the room and stood
at the door,  Brooke didn't even look at her.</p>
<p>'Thought I'd say hey.'  Sam tried.  She looked at the blonde
for a moment but got no answer and tried a different approach.  'You
want something to eat?'  Brooke shook her head and Sam bit her lower
lip.  'Well I'm going into the kitchen... shout if you need anything
okay?'  Sam waited for an answer but when she recieved none turned
and left.  She sat in the kitchen a while, not sure what to do.  She
thought over the day before and thought about Brooke being so upset
over what had happened.  The girl had looked so helpless laying on
that bed yesterday and Sam had wanted to help but couldn't understand
what was so important about the situation, in the end her inability
to comfort the girl infuriated her and she had ended up lashing out
at Brooke instead of being kind.  The whole matter was confusing her
and she had no idea what to do.</p>
<p>Brooke lay on the couch and found herself staring at the
ceiling once again.  She thought about all that had happened from her
accident, which caused her sprained ankle to how quickly her father
and Jane had just left her by herself.  It upset her a lot.  She knew
exactly what Nicole would be saying to her right now if she were here-
 'hon, don't think to much, your head will fall off'.  Brooke smiled
but it faltered because Nicole wasn't there. She couldn't rely on her
friends, she couldn't even rely on her father,  she was alone as she
could be.  Feeling her eyes well up again she covered them with her
hands, crying quietly to herself.</p>
<p>Sam was still sitting in the kitchen an hour later and
decided that it was time that they should eat some lunch cause it was
getting later.  She walked through to the living room again and saw
Brooke laying where she had left her.  She moved a little closer and
looked at the girls face.  Brookes eyes were closed and tear stains
were down her cheeks.  Her hair was a little messier than usual as
she had been lying down but Sam looked on and thought that she was
just as beautiful as she had always been, if not more.  Sam felt that
need again, to just take Brooke away from all her pain, but she
couldn't do that.  She could barely talk to the girl without making
her angry.  Brooke's eyes opened slowly and Sam faltered a little and
then tried to compose herself as Brooke looked on in confusion.</p>
<p>'I'm gonna make us something to eat whether you like it or
not.'  She walked out of the room quickly and to the kitchen.  She
stopped and banged her head off of the wall. 'McPhearson- you are an
idiot.' </p>
<p>Brooke sat up slightly and tried to figure out what was going
on.  She had dreamt that she had fallen again and that someone had
caught her out of the air and held on to her,next thing she knew she
had woken up to find Sam staring at her.  But there was a look in
Sam's eyes that was filled with concern and Brooke was thrown by it.
She was used to Sam fighting with her and she was also used to just
talking with Sam.  But there was a look in those brown eyes that was
so caring and she wasn't used to that.  Suddenly Sam walked back in,
still looking very flustered and looked everywhere about the room as
she talked but at Brooke.</p>
<p>'I went to make us something...there's no food tho', the
parentals are obviously oblivious to the fact that we eat and have
left the house empty... or maybe they did it on purpose so we would
starve to death cause they're fed up with us...'  Sam continued on
and Brooke watched in awe as the girl babbled '... and I mean, I do
have money... well enough to buy food... but I couldn't leave you
here... cause your ankle and... I wouldn't do that....'  Brooke saw
that look again as Sam spoke.  The girl was worried about her.  '...
so anyway... do you want some pizza?'  Brooke looked at the girl and
saw her blush as she met her gaze.</p>
<p>'Pizza's good'  she nodded and Sam took off again while
Brooke watched her go with mixed feelings stirring inside of her.</p>
<p>'Okay... smooth Sam. What is wrong with you?'  She whispered
to herself as she went to get the phone.  When she was making her way
back to the sitting room she took a deep breath.  She walked in and
sat down on one of the armchairs across the room, as far away as she
could from Brooke.</p>
<p>'Do I smell?'  Brooke grinned at Sam and Sam moved to another
chair, closer to Brooke.  They sat for a second in silence.</p>
<p>'Are you okay?'  Sam asked in a voice that was barely a
whisper and she looked at Brooke, a frown on her face.</p>
<p>'Well, my ankle still hurts, I dunno when it'll heal- but
it's gonna take a while.'</p>
<p>'No... I meant... nevermind'  Sam looked down.</p>
<p>'What?'  Brooke looked at Sam and wanted her to finish that
sentence so badly.  </p>
<p>'Hey, it's getting dark.'  Sam suddenly sprang up and put
some of the lamps on in the room.  Brooke sighed and watched Sam as
she sat back down.  The doorbell rang a minute later and Sam sprung
back up.</p>
<p>'you okay Sam... you're a little jumpy?'  Brooke stated...
but she thought it was kinda cute that Sam was all nervous.  *No I
didn't mean cute... yeah... I did... I think she's cute?*</p>
<p>'I'm fine'  she pointed out of the room and said 'Pizza'
before she left and Brooke smiled for the first time that day. </p>
<p>Sam brought the pizza through and Brooke looked at it:</p>
<p>'I don't think I'm hungry..'</p>
<p>'you have to eat Brooke... please... don't start not eating
again... it's not good for you'</p>
<p>'But, I look...'</p>
<p>'Don't you dare say fat McQueen, because you're anything
but.  You're perfect'  Sam paused for a second looking at Brooke and
they held each others gaze for a moment.  Sam spoke again;  'Is
Nicole putting those ideas in your head, coz if she is... I'll... and
anyway if anyone needs to lose weight it's me'  Sam frowned.</p>
<p>'Okay Sam, that's just crazy, you have a great figure.'  and
Brooke realised that as she said that her eyes drifted over Sams form
and she realised that she knew it well *how many times have I looked
at that body as to know it so well?*  Brooke wondered to herself and
smiled up at Sam.</p>
<p>'Can you pass me a slice... I can't reach from here.'  Sam
smiled back at Brooke and they sat silently and ate.</p>

<hr>

<p>'Oh God, I have missed pizza!!!'  Brooke purred as she
stretched.  Sam laughed and started to tidy up.</p>
<p>'See, you should let me look after you.'  She smiled and
turned to leave.  Brooke had been needing to go to use the bathroom
for a while and didn't think she could hold on much longer and stood
up. </p>
<p>As Sam threw the box into the trash she heard Brooke yell and
ran back into the room and helped the girl up.  </p>
<p>'Brooke, what are you doing?!?!'  Sam asked incrediously</p>
<p>'I need to go to the bathroom' she laughed through the pain.</p>
<p>'Well here...'  Sam lifted Brookes arm over her neck and
supported her waist as they walked to the bathroom on that
floor. 'I'll wait outside okay?'</p>
<p>A coupla minutes later Sam wondered why Brooke hadn't said
anything.</p>
<p>'Brooke... you okay?'  </p>
<p>'Yeah... I can't go with you out there... I'm kinda
embaressed... can you sing or something?'  She asked.</p>
<p>'No!  You sing...'  Sam pouted, she didn't like letting
people hear her sing.</p>
<p>'Sam, I can't I'm trying to concentrate... just go away or
something...'  Brooke laughed.</p>
<p>'Okay, I'll put my fingers in my ears and humm for like 1
min... and I'll warn you before I take my fingers out...'</p>

<hr>

<p>After the earlier embarresment the two girls were feeling a
little more comfortable around each other and sat for a while in the
living room together watching TV.</p>
<p>'See, I don't know why we fight so much?'  Brooke voiced
because her day with Sam had been quite fun.</p>
<p>'Well what would our lives be like without that little bit of
spice?'  Sam answered.</p>
<p>'Oh, you call it spice do you?  That's not what I would
say.'  Brooke grinned at Sam with a dangerously playful expression.</p>
<p>'Oh what would you call it?'  Sam grinned back.  Brooke
looked at her with a smile and was distracted by Sam's lips, and
found it hard to reply as the brunette licks said lips.  Brooke
shuddered a little and looked back up at Sam's eyes, which were also
fixed upon her own lips.  Brooke was unsure of what to do and tried
to distract herself.</p>
<p>'Well... I'm kinda tired now... being ill kinda wared you
out.'  That seemed to snap Sam out of her daze too and she looked at
Brooke with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p>'Spraining your ankle does not count as being ill Brooke.
Now, here- I'll take you upstairs.'</p>
<p>Brooke quite enjoyed Sam looking after her, it was fun, if it
had been her dad they would've watched every film they owned by now.
She stood onto her good leg and put an arm around Sam's neck and felt
the girl hold onto her tightly.  They made their way to the stairs
but as they attempted to make their way up them Brooke managed to put
a little too much weight onto her leg and hurt herself.  </p>
<p>'Are you okay?'  Sam asked immediately.</p>
<p>'Yeah, this is a pain in the ass!!!'</p>
<p>'Okay well, I guess there's no other way about it...'  Sam
said and Brooke looked at her in disbelief.</p>
<p>'Sam MacPhearson you are not going to carry me!!!'</p>
<p>'Brooke McQueen, yes I am!'  And with that Sam bent down and
tucked her arm under Brookes knees and lifted her.  </p>
<p>'Wow... you're sronger than you look'  An impressed Brooke
said.</p>
<p>'Well there's no other way is there?' and Sam smiled a
little.  Brooke watched as Sam's cheeks went red from her compliment
and continued to study her face as they made their way up the
stairs.  Sam sat Brooke down on her bed and stood back up.</p>
<p>'Well... goodnight, I'll leave the door open to my room so
you can shout if you need anything... okay?'  Brooke nodded at the
girl and Sam stood for a moment and looked as though she wanted to
say something more but turned to leave instead.</p>
<p>'Sam!?' Brooke stopped her.  'Thank you'  Sam smiled again
and walked out, leaving the doors open as she went.</p>

<hr>

<p>Sam slumped onto her bed and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>'You have fallen hard MacPhearson'  she whispered to
herself.  There was no other thought in her mind.  No doubt, no
warning that this was wrong or a bad idea because she knew that,
quite simply she was in love and that in itself was complex.  *What
am I going to do?*</p>

<hr>

<p>As soon as Sam had put Brooke down the girl had felt
something was missing and she lay for a while trying to figure out
what to do.  She was confused, that was for sure, but there was
something that she needed more than oxygen right now and that was Sam.</p>
<p>'Sam?'  She called softly.  And in an instant Sam was at her
door, not a sign of tiredness about her.</p>
<p>'Yeah... are you okay... do you need something?'  Sam looked
worried.</p>
<p>'Can you stay in here tonight...'  Brooke trailed off wanting
to say a lot more but not knowing the words.  Although Sam was
nervous she didn't think twice because whatever Brooke wanted she
would get for her. 	She lay down beside Brooke and switched the
nightlight off on the bedside table.  When she settled back down
Brooke cuddled into her and lay her head on Sam's chest. </p>
<p>'Goodnight Brooke.'  Sam said as she tried to remind herself
that Brooke was not hers.</p>
<p>'Night Sam'...*...I love you*</p>

<hr>

<p>Brooke's eyes fluttered as her dreamworld was invaded by the
light shining through the window.  She groaned and turned over, now
was the time for rest.  She stretched her arm out looking for Sam but
found an empty place where the girl had been laying the night
before.  Grumbling slightly she looked around and spied Sam at the
end of her bed, sitting with her back to Brooke.</p>
<p>'Sam are you okay?'  Brooke asked, still a little confused
from waking up.</p>
<p>'Sam, talk to me?'  She pleaded, worried by the girls lack of
response.  Something occured to Brooke *Oh God, I didn't do anything
in my sleep did I?*  She thought hard, trying to remember is she had
had any dreams which would have caused her to cry out Sams name in
the middle of the night.  She heard Sam sigh and held her own breath
as she waited for the brunette to speak.</p>
<p>'Brooke... we've known each other... for a long time.'  There
was a pause and Brooke thought back to when she first met Sam but
pulled herself away from the thought as she waited, nervously, for
the girl to say more.</p>
<p>'But... but I never noticed all the magic in your eyes, and
I've been around you so many times before, I mean you have always
been a friend to me... but now... I'm...'  Sam paused 'I'm wanting
more'  Brooke gasped, she hadn't expected anything like this from
Sam... she was barely sure about how she felt about the girl herself
but hearing Sam saying the words seemed to light a flame inside her.
She knew that this was what she wanted... Sam was sitting there and
all Brooke wanted was to hold the girl. Brooke watched as the girl
stood up and wondered what Sam was doing.  </p>
<p>'I must have been so blind, I never realised you're the one
that's right for me, all the while I couldn't see, and now I feel so
strange I don't think I'll ever be the same... I'm going round and
round in circles and I don't know what to do...'  Sam trailed off
again and Brooke frowned... there was something familiar about what
Sam was saying to her.  She frowned as Sam turned and sang:</p>
<p>'Cause Baby! </p>
<p>I've been thinking about you</p>
<p>In the most peculiar way...'
Brooke's eyes went wide as she watched Sam dance around her bedroom
and as a gospel choir appeared in the corner of her room...</p>
<p>... Brooke woke suddenly and gasped.</p>
<p>'Brooke, are you okay?'  Sam asked watching the girl with a
concerned look.</p>
<p>'Brooke turned to Sam and then turned to her radio alarm
clock with a frown.  She whacked the offensive item cutting off the
track that was playing.</p>
<p>'I hate that song.'  Brooke growled.</p>
<p>'Hey I like Mariah!'  Sam argued back.  Brooke just looked at
Sam and then flopped herself back down to where she had been laying.</p>
<p>'Figures'  She frowned.</p>

<hr>

<p>Brooke sighed as she sat up in her bad... she was really
confused and the dream she had had was just weird.  *But quite
nice... but weird... I mean, Mariah Carey!*  Brooke tried not to
think about that part of her dream and concentrate on the feelings
she had for Sam.  The situation was very confusing because suddenly
she didn't want to be apart from the girl.  When she wasn't with Sam
she didn't know what to do, but when she was with Sam Brooke would
panic.  All in all the cheerleader was very confused and needed
someone to talk things through with.</p>
<p>'God where's Nicole when you need her?'  Brooke sighed into
the room.</p>
<p>'Right here hon.'  Nicole greeted as she walked into the
room.  Brooke looked at Nicole in shock.  Sam then followed into the
room and stood uneasily at the door, making Brooke's stomach do a
flip. </p>
<p>'Oh...'  Nicole realised, 'Sammy invited me, thought you
needed some company.  I wondered where you had gotten to, hadn't
heard from you in days.'  Nicole said with a pout.</p>
<p>'Well, I should go...'  Sam trailed off, not knowing what to
say to the beautiful face which had been looking in her way since she
had entered the room.</p>
<p>'Bye Sam'  Brooke responded quickly, an eager expression on
her face.</p>
<p>'Yeah, bye!'  Sam squeaked and left.  Nicole sat on the bed
and looked at the spot that Sam had been standing in then back to
Brooke and back to the door again;</p>
<p>'Hon, I think you need to tell me something...' Nicole said
to her taller companion.  Brooke groaned and hit herself over the
head with a nearby cushion repeatedly.</p>

<hr>

<p>Sam stood at the bottom of the stairs with her back to a wall
and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>'Sam you are a DORK!!!  Just get over it alright!'  She
opened her eyes and found Lily and Carmen staring back at her, making
her jump.  'God guys knock much?!?!?!  You shouldn't just walk into
someone's home!'  Sam frowned at her friends but the expectant looks
on their faces to know what had got her in a state made her groan.</p>

<hr>

<p>'... Oh Good Lord!'  Nicole gasped.  Brooke closed her eyes
and nodded at her friend, she had just explained everything to her
friend- her confusion, her dreams, her feelings.</p>
<p>'How could anybody even listen to Mariah Carey... I mean
Brooke... we're cheerleaders and even we don't sink that low! Ick!'
Nicole finished of a look of pure distaste spread across her features.</p>
<p>'Okay, Nic, missing the point here!'  Brooke shouted back.</p>
<p>'Hon, keep your panties on.'  Nicole said rolling her eyes.</p>
<p>'Nic, stop!...God!... can you help me out here a little, I'm
so confused and...'  Nic cut her off before she said anything else;</p>
<p>'Brooke, please, confused?  Since the day you two met you've
been giving each other desperate, loved up looks both ways so don't
start with that, okay!?!  The only thing you're confused about is
wanting to screw someone who actually listens to Mariah Carey!'  The
disgusted look was back on Nicole's face.</p>
<p>'Nicole- you are so infuriating at times- you knew I liked
her- I didn't even know I liked her!!! I mean...'  Brooke
stopped '...what do you mean both ways?'  Brooke asked leading to
another roll of Nicole's eyes.</p>

<hr>

<p>'So what's going on?'  Carmen asked, beyond interested.  'I
mean, nobody gets under your skin like that except Brooke, or have
you finally gotten a clue?'  </p>
<p>'What?'  sam responded confused.</p>
<p>'Oh, Sam we know okay!  You have been so into Brooke sice you
did that whole 'Popular' article when you became editor of the school
magazine'  Lily said matter of factly.  'You could at least have told
us.'</p>
<p>'Wha..?' Sam said feeling faint.  If Lily and Carmen knew
already that meant Brooke must know and that definately was not
good.  'Okay could you guys just go!'  Sam said angrily, although she
wasn't sure what she was angry about. </p>
<p>'Oh fine, not only do you not tell us but when we finally
make you admit it you won't even talk to us.  You're a great friend
Sam.'  Carmen stalked out of the house in a huff.  Sam gritted her
teeth in her mouth.</p>
<p>'Sam, ignore her, she's just pissed because she didn't get
any gossip...'  Lily explained</p>
<p>'You still here?'  was the reply she got from her friend.</p>
<p>'Okay, if you wanna play like that... but if you wanna talk
phone, I'll listen, that's a friends job right?'  Lily stated before
she herself left.   Sam frowned once her friends had left. *What am I
gonna do?  Apparently the whole fucking school knows!'</p>
<p>'Hey Spammy!'  Nicole greeted as she walked by  'Take it easy
stud muffin'  she winked before she walked out of the door.</p>
<p>*Oh, fucking great, the WHOLE school*</p>

<hr>

<p>Meanwhile upstairs Brooke sat alone in her room. *Sam likes
me too?*</p>

<hr>

<p>Sam stared at the door which her three friends has just
walked out... well, her two friends and the evil hell beast who
called itself Nicole.  The tears silently fell down her cheeks before
she sobbed slightly and ran upstairs to her bedroom.  Things we're
going a little fast for the brunette to handle.</p>

<hr>

<p>Brooke was still sitting on her bed deliberating what to do.
*Tell her- right!*  She stood up and then sat down again.  *But what
if Nicole was wrong?*  Brooke sat still and then shrugged and stood
up again before quickly sitting down again.  This went on for
sometime as the blonde deliberated what to do until she heard Sam
crying downstairs which make her halt midstand so she was sort of
crouching... all in all it looked kinda funny.  She heard Sams
footsteps draw nearer as the brunette ran to her room and
automatically Brooke ran to Sam's room to check if the girl was okay,
not thinking once about her ankle.  The result was disasterous.
Brooke tried to catch the girl, half limping.  Sam ran into her room
and slammed the door straight into the unsuspecting Brooke, hitting
her square on the nose which then caused the girl to twist her
ankle... again.  </p>
<p>'Ow!'  Brooke cried as the door smacked her in the
face.  'SHIT!'  she then squealed as she fell over.  Sam's panic was
also obvious as she kept saying 'OH MY GOD!' over and over again
rapidly, not making the rather bashed Brooke feel any better.</p>
<p>'I'm so sorry!'  Sam said as she looked Brooke over 'Do you
need to go to the hospital?'  she asked, feeling absolutely horrified
at what she had done.</p>
<p>'No, I think I'm okay.'  Brooke nodded as blood trickled from
her nose.  'She put her hand up to her nose to catch the blood, only
to bump it and cause herself even more pain.  Brooke cursed again and
winced.</p>
<p>'Stay there, I'll get some ice!'  Sam comanded.</p>
<p>'It's not like I'm gonna go anywhere.'  She scowled back,
irritation seething in her words.</p>
<p>'Right'  sam agreed taking off.</p>

<hr>

<p>An hour later Brooke found herself laying on the sofa in the
sitting room staring at the ceiling.</p>
<p>'You know I'm really starting to hate this room'  the blonde
frowned as Sam walked in, having tidied away the blood stained towels.</p>
<p>'Do you want to go upstairs?'  Sam offered, getting a nod
from Brooke she walked over to the girl and lifter her easily into
her arms.  Brooke grinned to herself, she didn't really want to go
upstaris but she really enjoyed being carried around by Sam.</p>
<p>'I am really sorry about all this'  Sam apologiesed for the
50th time.  Brooke just shook her head;</p>
<p>'Really Sammy, it wasn't your fault- it was an accident.'
*Sammy... God Brooke you have a pet name for her and everything*</p>
<p>*Did she just call me Sammy?*  Sam smiled and then shook off
the feelings she was having.  The thoughts from earlier were
returning and she wondered how she had managed to ignore her feelings
for the blonde when everyone else realised how badly she was crushing
on the cheerleader.</p>
<p>'What's troubling you Sammy- what are you thinking about?'
Brooke asked as she touched a finger to Sam's furrowed brow.  *there
you go again with the 'Sammy' thing McQueen*</p>
<p>'Nothing.'  Sam lied.</p>
<p>'Tell me'  Brooke whispered and she lifted the hand that was
resting against Sam's upper back to her neck , running her fingers
along the skin there soothingly.  She watched as Sams eyes fluttered
a little before she cleared her throat and tried to concentrate on
carrying Brooke up the last remaining stairs.  Brooke couldn't help
but grin as Sam's cheeks flushed.  *Not giving in that easily huh
Sammy?*  She waited until they had finished climbing the stairs
before her next action- she didn't want the poor girl dropping her.
She tucked a lock of  Sam's hair behind her ear and ran a finger
along Sam's jawline, watching with interested as a muscle there
tensed at the touch.  *Brook McQueen- this is foul play*  </p>
<p>'Uhm... B- Brooke?'  Sam stuttered</p>
<p>'Mmm-hmmm?'  Came the honey coated reply as Brooke continued
to tease Sam's soft skin.</p>
<p>'What are you doing?'  She asked as she stopped, trying to
clear her head.  She didn't know what Brooke was doing this to her,
and she wasn't in the right mind to think that anything was really
that wrong with Brooke's actions but she needed to distract herself
somehow because whatever Brooke was doing it was making her feel a
little odd.  Brooke looked back at her innocently and ran her nail
down Sam's throat, the girl was so lost right now she probably didn't
have a clue as to why Brooke was touchng her and that made Sam all
the more attractive to Brooke.  *God, horny much?!?!?!*  Brooke
chastised herself although she didn't cease her actions.</p>
<p>'I'm worried about you Sammy.'  Brooke said tilting her head
slightly.</p>
<p>'Oh?'  Sam still hadn't moved a step, not trusting her legs
to work properly.</p>
<p>'yeah.  Maybe we should go into your room so that you can lay
in your own bed, where you are comfortable because you're looking a
little hot.'  Brooke whispered to the girl, not able to hold back the
seductive smile that graced her features. Sam swallowed hard and
changed direction, making her way into her own room- she really did
need to lie down, but it probably wasn't going to help her much
because Brooke would be right there beside her.  She reached her bed
and bent to lay Brooke down, the action resulted in her practically
laying on top of the cheerleader, their faces seperated by a few
inches only.  Sam closed her eyes, not able to take being this close
to Brooke any longer.  Brooke looked into the face of the girl she
loved and kicked herself for teasing the girl so much.  There was a
look close to pain on Sam's face because she believed her feelings
were not returned, which Brooke couldn't believe after what she had
just pulled off.  Brooke raised her head and pressed her lips softly
against Sam's parted ones.  Sam's eyes flew open at the contact and
she was greeted by the sight of Brooke, bliss painted across her face
as she kissed her.  Sam responded after a while, her brain taking a
while to register exactly what was going on.  When they separated Sam
was dumbfounded.  Brooke smiled at her. </p>
<p>'Hey'</p>
<p>'Hey'</p>
<p>'So you have the hots for me, huh?'  Brooke grinned,
ecstatically happy.</p>
<p>'So it seems'  Sam smiled back 'though I don't appreciate
being teased Miss McQueen- that display back there was cruel and
uncalled for.  That's like leading me on and leaving me flat!'  Sam
scolded.</p>
<p>'Who said I was gonna stop here...'  Brooke trailed off as
she brought their lips back together.</p>
