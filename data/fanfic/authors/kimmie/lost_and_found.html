<!-- Lost & Found \ Story -->

<p>"Look for the last time I did not take your bracelet!"  Sam
was feeling absolutely exasperated.  This fight had been going on for
the last hour, and there were only so many times that you could state
your case.  She eyed Brooke with distaste, the girl really did like
to pick on her.</p>
<p>"I know you took it, who else comes into my room?"  Brooke
knew that she was acting very harsh, and if it were over something
trivial then she would not mind, but the piece of jewelery meant a
lot to her.  So, this time she felt she had the right to fight.  For
some reason it was feeling quite intense.  </p>
<p>"Okay, yeah, I come into your room from time to time... but
to talk to you, not to STEAL things"  A while ago Sam had hoped that
maybe Brooke and her could get along, somewhere in the back of her
head she knew that she could like this girl, well, if she weren't so
pig-headed she could.</p>
<p>"TALK! Yeah, right.  You come in here and abuse me over some
little cause that you decide needs to be brought to the surface, you
come in here looking for a fight- you have no right to judge me!"
Brooke could feel all the fire that was building up inside of her
stomach and she wanted to scream, she needed to get rid of the
burning.</p>
<p>"Me judge YOU!?!? What do you call this.  Stop accusing me
and listen to what I say!"  Sam could feel the anger bubble up inside
herself, making her flush a little as she turned the tables around.
As the words left her lips she moved close to Brooke, emphasising her
point.</p>
<p>"Well I would if you ever told the truth!"  Brooke raised her
voice a bit more.</p>
<p>"God! Brooke!"  Sam shouted back.</p>
<p>"What?" She yelled.  Then the girls were together and they
found themselves in each others arms, kissing hard.  The kiss was
rough, and as soon as their lips were pressed against each other, the
contact was lost as they both pulled back quickly, seperating their
bodies, distancing themselves from the desperate grasp with which
they held each other.</p>
<p>"... w-what was that?!"  Sam asked a look of shock and fright
written across her features.  She wasn't the only one who was
startled.  Brooke stood, her eyes wide, as she tried to compose
herself quickly.</p>
<p>"Well, aparently YOU kissed me!"  Brooke shouted forcefully
at Sam.</p>
<p>"ME?!?!?!"  Sam couldn't believe this girl "Would you stop
blaming ME for everything- you were the one who grabbed me first!"
Sam could feel the anger building again.</p>
<p>"Don't lie!" </p>
<p>"I'm not!!!" Suddenly the girls were kissing again, just as
hard, neither one having initiated the action, but being thrown into
together.  The kiss didn't end as quickly this time though.  They
held each other close while their lips stayed pressed together.  When
the kiss ended the girls did not part, they kept their bodies close
and looked at each other- as if for the first time.</p>
<p>"Okay... well maybe you didn't make the first move..."
Brooke smiled, causing Sam to give a grin of her own, she loved when
Brooke smiled like that.</p>
<p>"Shut up Brooke"  Sam leaned in, meeting Brookes lips more
tenderly, but the kiss was still filled with passion.  A light moan
escaped from deep within Brooke as she granted Sam's tongue access
into her mouth.  The kiss was not a battle, but an exploration.  Sam
continued to tease Brookes tongue, coaxing it into her own mouth
where she sucked a little on the blonde's tongue before breaking the
contact.  She watched Brooke carefully and studied the beautiful
face.  Her eyes were still closed, her lips parted a little and a
slight flush was present in her cheeks.  She stroked Brookes cheek
lightly with the back of her hand and smiled as her eyes finally
opened, Brookes blue eyes staring at her in wonderment.  Sam placed a
finger over Brookes lips, stopping her from saying a word.  Brooke
smiled against the digit and darted her tongue out quickly, tasting
the skin before sucking it into her mouth.  Sam groaned as Brooke bit
lightly on her index finger, before her eyes slid shut.  When she
felt herself being released from the hold Brooke had of her she
opened her eyes and was about to protest when the girl placed her
finger over her lips, mimicking the brunettes action, and grinned at
her before pulling Sam towards the bed.</p>
<p>Brooke stradled Sams waist after pushing her down onto the
soft matress.  She grinned at her before pulling her top over her own
head, revealing herself.  The girl who was pinned between her looked
over the perfect form of her captor, noting that she had not been
wearing a bra.  As Sam slid her hands slowly up Brookes sides, the
blonde leaned down and reclaimed her lips again, arching into the
hands which cupped her breasts.  As Sam played with Brookes soft
skin, she began to long to feel it against her own.  She broke the
kiss and moved her hands to the buttons on her shirt but quickly
Brooke took over, unfastening each quickly.  When the blonde was
removing the shirt, Sam began to take her own bra off.  Brooke
grinned devilishly and dipped her head down, taking an already erect
nipple into her mouth as her hands slid lower, unfastening her now,
topless companions trousers.  Sam let her head fall back onto the
pillow as Brooke moved to her other breast, driving the girl crazy
with her tongue and occasionally biting lightly on the sesitive
skin.  It wasn't until Brooke sat up again to stradle Sam's waist
that the brunette realised that she was completely naked.  She could
feel her cheeks flushing in a mix of surprise and arousal as she felt
a hand slide up her thigh.  Brooke moved so that she was laying
beside the other girl but still slightly over her, she was running
her fingers higher but slowly, teasing the other girl.  When she
watched Sams eyes flutter shut she stopped and looked into her face
with a concerned expression.  The other girl opened her eyes and
Brooke bent her head and whispered quietly to Sam.</p>
<p>"You've never.... I mean have you ever been with anybody?"
Brooke glanced down to put across her point and she tried not to
giggle at the absurdity of not being able to say 'sex' to Sam, the
girl was laying naked beside her for Gods sake.</p>
<p>Sam shook her head indicating that she hadn't and looked down.</p>
<p>"Hey, hey..." Brookes voice was sooting as she spoke"no, I
just don't want to hurt you." She smiled a little to the other girl
as she lifed her chin with her hand.  She kissed Sam on the lips
gently over and over again, then gradually deepened the kiss as her
hand slipped lower over her body.  When she reached the dark curls
she was shocked to find how damp they were to her touch, then as she
dipped a finger to her entrance she gasped at how wet Sam actually
was and heard the girl moan.  She was careful at first, making sure
that Sam was ready and then slowly and gently slid two fingers into
Sam.  She watched as Sam whimpered and closed her eyes tightly.  The
muscles contracted around her two fingers and Brooke kissed Sams
parted lips again</p>
<p>"Are you okay?" Sam nodded in answer and thrust her hips up.
Brooke bit her lower lip as she watched the sensual action and began
to gently thrust into Sam.  It didn't take long for a quicker pace to
set in, and Brooke began to press on Sams clit with her thumb as she
took the girl higher.  </p>
<p>"Is that good?"  Brooke whispered close to Sams ear, causing
her to shudder slightly, Brooke took that as a 'yes' and continued.</p>
<p>"Please Brooke"  Sam asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>Brooke looked into the brunettes face and felt a wave of
excitement rush through her as she looked at Sam.  She began to
thrust a little deeper and felt Sams walls convulse around her
fingers.  She kept her eyes on Sams face as the girl came, moaning
her name.  She lowered her head and kissed Sam lovingly as she slowed
her actions and moved her arms around the girl.</p>
<p>They lay together in Brookes bed for hours, watching each
other peacefully, and kissing.  Sam leaned over slightly and yelped
as she felt something cool digging into her thigh a little.  Reaching
down she pulled out a bracelet and held it up in Brookes view.</p>
<p>"What were you saying earlier?"  Sam questioned, pouting
slightly.</p>
<p>"Oh, like you didn't hide it there...."  This time Sam leaned
in and kisses Brookes lips, stopping any words.</p>
<p>"Y'know.... we should fight more often"  Brooke grinned as
she pulled Sam down on top of her.</p>
