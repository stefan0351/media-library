<p>B'Elanna returned her smile with a smaller one of her own. The Klingon asked if EnNokkia was participating in the tournament, but the pretty Nokk said no, in a disappointed tone. She was not allowed to because of her delicate profession as an artist for the House, though she did practice the combat skills. And from the looks of her, B'Elanna surmised, she must practice a lot. EnNokkia complimented B'Elanna on her formal presentation to the House, for which B'Elanna flushed. The lieutenant told her about the similarities between her own Klingon culture and the Nokk's. Just then, Edyn returned from speaking to a member of another House in order to get the scoop. He informed her it was time to return to LenNokk and finish presenting herself. EnNokkia asked to accompany them, and B'Elanna welcomed her. Once again they walked through the throng of people, and B'Elanna wondered which one of these warriors was going to be her opponent that night. Edyn led her to a corner where the competitors were being measured and examined. A graying Nokk waved her over as several warriors looked on, all sizing her up. They seemed to loom above her as the older member measured her height, arm span, and leg span. </p>
<p>The last thing he did was tell her to undress so that she could be weighed. Huffing for a moment and sparing a withering look at Edyn, who by then found himself drooling, B'Elanna stripped down to her Star Fleet issue sports top and briefs.  Luckily, she had changed into the conservative undies this morning. EnNokkia eyed her appreciatively, unbeknownst to the half-Klingon, who was more nervous that a group of males had congregated around her space. The Klingon's lean muscles flexed and contracted before EnNokkia's very gaze. Physique was valued greatly in Nokk society, as it honorable to keep oneself fit for service to the House if ever one was called to arms in defense of the it. The gray-haired Nokk began laying the weights to the counterbalance of the scale. He got up to five tenokks before he squinted at her in confusion. </p>
<p>"Is there something wrong?" B'Elanna asked pointedly, her hands on her hips.</p>
<p>"No, of course not," he answered the warrior quickly.  </p>
<p>The wrong thing to do was make a comment on a female's weight, he had learned over the years. His partner, a more elderly female, urged him to get on with it, as the young woman couldn't be in her underwear all day. He laid one more tenokk and a couple of rems onto the scale, and finally the balance began to move and level off. The elderly Nokk recorded the weight measured on a tablet, and gestured for the lieutenant to get off and dress. Even Edyn seemed a bit surprised at how much the compact beauty weighed. B'Elanna scrambled back into her clothes, a little self conscious by the way the warriors alternated between looking at her and whispering among themselves.</p>
<p>It was time to once again, to stand before LenNokk, and during the next trial, she had to be extremely confident. The Klingon found herself under the scrutiny of the House of EnNokk, with EnNokkia joining her family's side.</p>
<p>"You will now demonstrate your worthiness," commanded LenNokk. </p>
<p>A small twenty by twenty foot space was cleared and several youthful EnNokk members stood impassively within it. One of them held a thick, square, wooden board between his hands. B'Elanna understood she was expected to break it during her exercise. She removed her short coat, shook out her limbs and stretched her supple body a few times. She gave Edyn a steady look as he stood to the side, and he clasped his hands together in what looked to be a gesture of luck. </p>
<p>B'Elanna began a series of Klingon katas she learned and practiced in front of her mother, after her brief stay at the Klingon monastery. She had kept practicing them all throughout her life because she had gotten into fights often, and wanted to defend herself from the more discriminating inhabitants of Kessick IV. Star Fleet self-defense would have been improper to use under the circumstances. When one of the members of the square moved in to attack her, she parried the blows and quickly brought him down with grappling, not wanting to harm the young bloods. They moved out of the way once they were defeated. </p>
<p>Edyn looked on with beaded sweat trickling down the sides of his face, worried that the young woman would misstep, but she never did.  His heart was filled with admiration as her slick body countered every attack smoothly, until she, at last, reached the wooden board. B'Elanna hesitated for a brief second, not knowing what type of wood material it was constructed from, but only for a second before she split it with one blow of her closed fist in a reverse punch. Her knuckles came away unscathed save for a small scratch.</p>
<p>LenNokk was suitably impressed with the display of power and grace. "You have much skill. I believe you will be a competitive opponent."</p>
<p>Another Nokk warrior stepped forward to address his leader. He was about 6'1" with a deep reddish brown hair, and dressed somewhat formally, his bare arms ornamented with golden bands that clenched at his powerful biceps. The Nokk had a no-nonsense intensity about him, accentuated by the small scars all along his oval face and cleft chin, no doubt from many fights.</p>
<p>"You are allowing her to challenge, Great EnNokk? What about my brother? He was due for his chance of receiving honor from our House," the Nokk claimed, his green eyes flashing.</p>
<p>"Jae'Nokk, your brother cannot challenge this cycle of the moon, because I intend for YOU to be our champion. You brother is not ready yet, at least, not to challenge this warrior," LenNokk stated with authority. </p>
<p>Jae'Nokk was about to reply, but thought the better of it. It was not wise to confront the leader of the House, no matter who his mother was. Instead, he directed his condescending glare towards the half-Klingon. </p>
<p>"I will meet you in combat tonight. Do not waste the opportunity," he advised, his tone dripping with acidity.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Seven examined the droid's optic circuitry distractedly. She had been waiting for B'Elanna to return for the past two hours, but still, the half-Klingon did not appear. Dannan sat at his work table, fashioning a new transceiver for one of the D2 droids that had arrived that morning for repairs. He noticed the Borg's restlessness, and tried to reassure her.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Ani. She'll be back soon," he told her, twisting the the knot of wires between his fingers.</p>
<p>"I fail to see how you can remain calm. We both disagree with her method of obtaining the credits. There is still time to prevent this from proceeding further," Seven urged. She moved her chair closer to Dannan's. "Bey respects you, Dannan. She will listen to you if you tell her not to fight."</p>
<p>"Perhaps. But it's not just me that she has made her decision against. She chose to ignore your requests, and that demonstrates to me how resolved she is," he said, looking straight into the Borg's eyes.  "Bey is concerned for your well-being. And no amount of arguing or pleading from me or Moka will change her mind."</p>
<p>Seven looked away, blushing at the man's words. Dannan noted that his words had achieved the right effect, seeing as how the pink had risen on the young woman's cheeks. Dannan pushed the wires back into the opening and tapped the panel back in place. Seven stood up and walked away, gazing out into the streets from the window.</p>
<p>Dannan continued, "Which is why I will no longer openly oppose her decision."</p>
<p>Seven turned, frowning. "Please explain?" she asked.</p>
<p>"To do so would cause her distress, and would divert her attention away from what she needs to really concentrate on. We must put her mind at ease," Dannan explained. "She must know she has our full support."</p>
<p>Seven nodded. "She will have it," declared the ex-drone. "However, I must tell you I will do what I have to, to insure Bey's safety as well."</p>
<p>Before Dannan could question what she meant by that particular statement, the shop door opened, and Edyn and B'Elanna entered. The ratty-faced dealer strolled into the room, beaming from ear to ear. B'Elanna trailed in after him, and was greeted by the subtle smile on Seven's face. Seven's eyes lighted when she saw her lieutenant approach her side. </p>
<p>"How did it go?" Dannan inquired, as he took Edyn's hand in a grasp of greeting.</p>
<p>"Fantastic. Bey made a big impression at the presentation." He continued, "At least, I found myself admiring her attributes."</p>
<p>Dannan elbowed him, as B'Elanna gave him a dirty look, which Seven mirrored.</p>
<p>"As well as LenNokk,...the entire House of EnNokk." He couldn't resist adding, "...and their young mistress, EnNokkia."  He grinned impudently at the fiery warrior, whose eyes suddenly shot wide open.</p>
<p>Seven quirked her brow with the last statement. Stepping close to Edyn, she said, "Perhaps, you should tell us exactly what happened."</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>The wind had picked up that day, and many of the inhabitants of the planet were left trying to find shelter. People walked around with their cloaks held up to their noses as they moved through the streets, as stall owners continued to peddle their merchandise to anyone wandering around. Two figures made their way to a make-shift tent that housed an open bar. They were glad to be finally out of the sandy storm, and sat down at a free table. Kal and Orn took off their cloaks and shook off the sand that had been trapped in the folds. A waiter came by and took their orders for food and drinks. Kal leaned back in his chair, and glanced around the tent for people he knew. A mixed group of aliens took up several benches in the middle, and it looked as though they were gambling. The roll of dice could be heard in between the ruckus of laughter and swearing. Kal grabbed his beer once it had been placed in front of him, and started to guzzle it down. He was done quickly, and ordered another one before the waiter even finished setting the plates. </p>
<p>A thin, young Nokk ran under the tent, huffing and puffiing, apparently from the exertion. In his hand, he held a roll of paper, which he lifted high before the crowd in the tent.</p>
<p>"I have the list!" he exclaimed excitedly, waving it around like bait to predators.</p>
<p>One of the members of the crowd, a tall fella with a webbed neck, narrow face and mustard-colored skin, came forth and took the paper from the young man's hand. He unrolled the list and glanced over it, immediately smiling. He patted the Nokk on the shoulder, and led him towards the tables. Kal recognized Wex, the man now holding the list, another fellow Mewk whom he had served with on another ship several years ago. The man was crafty, and had a good sense of where the money was and how to get it. </p>
<p>"Here it is, my friends. The list of competitors in the Nokk tournament, their names, identifying descriptions, and measurements. There seems to be only a few non-Nokks entered into the tournament this moon," announced Wex. He leaned over and murmured something to the young Nokk, who quickly brought over a standing board, and proceeded to copy the competitors, their statistics, and their opponents onto the board. </p>
<p>Kal put down his drink, and told Orn, "I'll be back. I need to say hello to an old friend."</p>
<p>Kal sauntered over to the table where his friend sat reading off the names of the contestants. The rowdy bunch of aliens were already talking about the fighters, and who they thought were going to win. Money was starting to jingle in their pockets, and soon, the betting would begin as well. </p>
<p>"Wex!" the gang leader shouted out.</p>
<p>The bookie turned to see who yelled out his name, and grinned when he saw his former shipmate amongst the crowd. </p>
<p>"Kal, you old scamp. What are you doing on this forsaken planet?" Wex asked.</p>
<p>"Repairs to my ship. It's a long story," Kal muttered, not wanting to mention his embarrassing incident with the two escaped females. "So this is what you've been up to."</p>
<p>"Aye, I carved out a nice little niche for myself here," the other Mewk agreed. "What about you? You want to place a bet?"</p>
<p>"Humph.... Maybe, if you've got some insider's info I could use," Kal hinted.</p>
<p>"For you, of course. It looks to me like there's an interesting match between a young Nokk, and a new alien warrior. The Nokk has been 5 to 1, and has a mean streak to him. Could be interesting to see who wins, 'cause his opponent's a female. The statistics are skewered towards the Nokk, but I'm betting on the female."</p>
<p>"Let me see," Kal asked, holding out his hand for the list.  Wex handed him the paper and pointed out the statistics for both the warriors.                                           </p>
<p>"Those betters are ignoring the fact that the female weighs like a middle class fighter. There's got to be something different about this alien," reasoned Wex.  "There's no way she could weigh that much without something peculiar about her anatomy."                       </p>
<p>'Peculiar, alright. Brown skin, dark hair, forehead ridges, 2.25 metros tall,... I know exactly who you are.' Kal thought to himself, almost crumpling the paper in his fists, already planning his revenge.</p>

<p>Seven and B'Elanna were out in the backyard to Dannan's shop, where they had retreated to after the Borg had heard about what happened at the Nokk tavern. Seven had asked a great deal of questions regarding the whole presentation, but also inquired about some very specific details regarding EnNokkia, to B'Elanna's chagrin. Now the Borg was quiet, and B'Elanna couldn't help but wonder what the heck was going through the woman's mind. She didn't want to hope that Seven could be jealous. Edyn and Dannan were still out in the front, probably discussing what was going to happen later that night. </p>
<p>Seven sat on a storage container, and watched as the half-Klingon flexed her limber body to work out the last kinks before her fight tonight. Normally, she would be fascinated by the exhibition, but at the moment, she couldn't help her feelings of nervousness.</p>
<p>"I know this is bothering you, Ani," B'Elanna commented, as she raised her leg high against the wall and bent forward to stretch her hamstrings and calves out.</p>
<p>"What I feel is irrelevant now," Seven answered.</p>
<p>B'Elanna dropped her leg, and walked over to where the blonde sat. "Of course it's relevant," B'Elanna told her, frowning at the negative remark Seven made toward herself.</p>
<p>Seven shook her head, in the most human way.  "No, not now. You must focus on the competition. Regardless of my...feelings...," Seven admitted.  </p>
<p>"I support you completely, Bey. I know you will succeed, for me," she whispered, "and for yourself."  </p>
<p>A little startled, the lieutenant leaned her body against the container next to Seven.  "Wow. Thanks for the vote of confidence," B'Elanna replied, brows raised amazement. No one had ever told her anything like that before.</p>
<p>"You have mine. All of my confidence," Seven whispered, sliding her Borg hand under B'Elanna's, and interlacing their fingers.</p>
<p>B'Elanna looked up shyly at Seven from the sight of their hands locked together, and found it difficult to speak with a lump in her throat.         </p>
<p>"You promised we would talk," Seven began. </p>
<p>"Right.... Talk...," B'Elanna murmured. The Klingon's mind was drawing a total blank, and her throat had gone dry. She didn't know why it was so hard.</p>
<p>"But this is not the right time, and you are not ready," Seven concluded, noting the way the lieutenant stopped speaking in full sentences.</p>
<p>Regretfully, the ex-drone released their hands, and stood up stiffly. She walked to the center of the yard and looked back at B'Elanna, hands linked behind her back as usual.</p>
<p>"Perhaps, I should show you some Tsunkatse moves," she suggested, moving her hands and feet into position.</p>
<p>B'Elanna smiled but eyed her cautiously.  "Are you sure you're up to it, Seven?," she asked, knowing that Seven was not quite fully recovered.</p>
<p>Seven quirked her brow, and beckoned the half-Klingon over.</p>
<p>Her limbs were, unfortunately, not entirely back to normal. The Borg's movements lacked their usual grace and coordination.  Still, B'Elanna was game. It distracted from the difficult conversation ahead of them. B'Elanna pushed herself away from the storage container, and approached Seven's side, taking the same pose. She copied the moves Seven made, and when the ex-drone faltered, B'Elanna was right by her side.</p>
<p>"Maybe this wasn't such a good idea," B'Elanna observed after catching Seven, her arms around the lithe waist.</p>
<p>"I am alright, Bey. You do not need to support me," Seven sighed, questioning why it was easier for B'Elanna to touch her when she was damaged.</p>
<p>"Sorry," she apologized, removing her hands. "Why don't you just tell me what to do, and adjust my moves if you need to?"</p>
<p>"Of course," Seven agreed.</p>
<p>The two women spent the hour practicing, as they hid their feelings behind reassuring touches they gave one another. B'Elanna enjoyed each time Seven corrected her limbs or posture, as it progressed to the point where Seven began embracing her from behind to direct her movements. B'Elanna liked the way Seven took control of her body, or rather, practically commandeered it. She wondered if they could ever do anything together again that wouldn't involve sexual tension between her and Seven, at least from her perception.</p>
<p>But more than that, B'Elanna wanted to love the young Borg, the way she deserved to be loved. She couldn't ignore, however, the rumors she had heard on board Voyager. And if they were true, she didn't want to step in between the Captain and Seven, because she respected Janeway, and because it was wrong. </p>
<p>"Are you paying attention, Bey?" Seven broke her reverie.</p>
<p>"What? Um,...yes. Well, maybe I got a bit distracted." </p>
<p>"I suppose better now than during the tournament," Seven noted dryly.</p>
<p>"Of course. 'Cause I'm going to kick butt tonight," B'Elanna joked, grinning at the ex-drone.</p>
<p>"No doubt you will be magnificent. I look forward to seeing you win."</p>
<p>B'Elanna stopped grinning instantly, and frowned.  "Ani, you're staying at Dannan's tonight," she told her.</p>
<p>Seven's face darkened, but her voice did not raise. "I wish to go with you. You will need...a friendly face in the crowd," she persuaded. "Please do not make me stay behind again."</p>
<p>B'Elanna walked a few steps away, staring off into the crop of nearby buildings. "I won't be able to concentrate if I know you're out there in the crowd watching." She turned to face Seven, and added, "I don't want you to do something impulsive if you think things start looking bad for me. I don't want you to see me..."</p>
<p>"You will not fail. And I will not interfere! I will comply with your commands, but allow me to accompany you," Seven replied with a hint of distress.</p>
<p>B'Elanna crossed over to the Borg, and took hold her arms to comfort her.  "I don't want the tournament to dredge up any bad memories for you. It'll be over quickly, anyway, and I'll be home right after.... Ani, promise me you won't go there."</p>
<p>Seven turned her face away stubbornly. Seven would not allow the lieutenant to place herself in danger without her looking out for the half-Klingon. An idea in her mind clicked.</p>
<p>"You will not see me there," Seven answered dejectedly.</p>
<p>B'Elanna pulled the woman to her, wrapping her arms around Seven, and hugged her tightly. She hoped the young Borg would eventually understand. Seven was moved by the spontaneous gesture of affection, and put her own arms around B'Elanna's neck, resting her cheek against the proud brow. She wished the moment would never end, as they held each other. Seven wondered if this was what the Doctor referred to as being in love. If this was, then she was in love with the half-Klingon. They stayed in each other arms for a while longer until Edyn came to get B'Elanna.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>B'Elanna sat on the bench inside the tavern. The fights were being held in the lot behind the structure. Several of the other Houses participating in this moon's tournament had already determined their winners. Edyn was going over some of the rules at the last minute, but for the most part, the fight was a no-holds-barred approach. She had gotten a glimpse of the arena when she first arrived, and it was somewhat intimidating, she had to admit. The pit was only four feet deep to allow the House members and spectators view of the fight. The square arena itself was curtained off tightly with a full line-up of Nokk warriors, each holding a short wooden staff. They kept the fight inside the arena. Outside the pit, tables and benches were filled with spectators, but the far side of the square was reserved for the House that sponsored the particular fight to look on. The area was lit brightly by tall torches that flamed strongly against the mild winds. </p>
<p>The Klingon felt butterflies in her stomach, despite all the reassurances she had received. Even EnNokkia had come by to wish her luck, with Edyn winking at B'Elanna as the young lady bestowed a kiss on her forehead. The lieutenant had been in countless combat situations before, but this was the first time it had held any type of cultural significance for her. Her own House's honor was at stake, as well as her personal pride. To fail was a disgrace, and perhaps, a one way ticket straight to Gre'thor. Surprisingly, to calm herself, she began a Vulcan meditation Tuvok had taught her.</p>
<p>The drumming began outside, signaling the start of the tournament procession. First, the elders of the House of EnNokk would leave the tavern and seat themselves to judge the fight. Then, their champion would follow, and finally B'Elanna would enter as the challenger. The lieutenant stood up, letting her long, belted red jersey hang down to her knees. The fitted jersey was sleeveless, showing off her sleek arms, and its sides were split from her hips down to allow her lower limbs freedom to kick. She wore the black loose-fitting pants that all the warriors wore, but tailored to her size. The crest of the EnNokk House was embroidered in black onto the front of the jersey, and B'Elanna looked at the wondrous design. The triangular shape was made of up sharp, wavy, abstract flames at the three corners that merged and swirled around the center of the design, a circular meander which looped and linked back around itself to where she couldn't see its beginning or its end. Peering at it carefully, the shape seemed to take on a serpentine appearance. Whoever created it must have been a great shaman, or at least a very drugged up one.</p>
<p>Finally, the drum beats changed, indicating it was her turn to present herself in the arena. Edyn was allowed to accompany her to her corner of the pit as a coach and sponsor. Steadily she walked through the doorway of the tavern, trying her best to ignore the quiet gazes from the crowd, and focused her eyes, instead, on the honored family across the pit. She made her way down the ramp to the arena where the line of Nokk warriors parted briefly to allow them both through. She stopped when she met Jae'Nokk, who wore the same crest on his hunter green jersey, and his coach in the center of the square, and they all turned to face the House of EnNokk. B'Elanna saw EnNokkia, who smiled briefly at her favored competitor, sitting to the left of LenNokk. She wore a stunning gown of emerald green, and a black choker with a matching jewel.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Nokk warriors, surrounding the combatants, struck the floor mightily and synchronously with their staffs, and then began an unwavering baritone chant. Edyn winced as his own eardrums vibrated to the sonic pulsations that were emitted. When the chant ended, LenNokk stood and addressed the entire gathering.</p>
<p>"Welcome to our Ritual of the Third Ivory Moon, a celebration of life and honor that has passed from generation to generation among my people. The House of EnNokk extends its hospitality to its guests, so drink well and enjoy the skills of combat to be demonstrated here tonight. Our family presents these two warriors who seek honor for themselves, Jae'Nokk of the House of EnNokk, our champion, and Beylanna, Daughter of Miral of the House of Prasba. Let the tournament begin!" he announced, raising his steel goblet in the air.</p>
<p>The crowd erupted in loud response and applaud, and tipped their glasses to the sponsoring House. The excitement of a new fight swept through the people as they chattered, often arguing among themselves who they thought was going to win. No one noticed a lone cloaked figure that came through the tavern gates, and settled itself at one of the tables overlooking the pit, on the right side. When a small, fat Tarkadian tried to point out that the seat had already been reserved, the figure glared back menacingly. Then smirked as the fat man backed off and scooted even further away down the bench they shared.</p>
<p>B'Elanna went to her respective corner to prepare herself for the coming violence. She bounced up and down on the dirt that covered the arena floor. It was a thick yellow, pasty soil that was seedy more than grainy, preventing it from being used to blind opponents, she supposed. It also would cushion any falls. Edyn looked at the young woman, checking to see if the Klingon was ready. He didn't realize until now how diminutive she seemed compared to her opponent. At 2.25 metros tall (5'5"), he could hardly believe she weighed in at the middle weight class for Nokks. He took the box which he had been handed while waiting in the tavern, as it held the weapons for the first round, and opened it for B'Elanna.</p>
<p>"T-batons...?" B'Elanna questioned as she reached in and took the weapons, one in each hand. </p>
<p>They were solid, blunt instruments that could do a lot of damage. These were heavy, probably made from hardwood covered with black lacquer and polished to a fine finish. She twirled them around to get the feel for their weight and balance.</p>
<p>"Remember, each round is three minutes. Only the first allows weapons, after that they are taken from you. If you are completely disarmed, then you will lose the round," Edyn reminded her.</p>
<p>"Got it," she replied. B'Elanna spun one baton around so that the longer length paralleled her left forearm to block attacks. She would use her right arm, the stronger one, to attack. </p>
<p>The warriors pounded their staffs again, and two Nokk maidens entered the square bringing goblets of wine on their trays. One of the warriors indicated to B'Elanna to down the drink offered to her. B'Elanna threw a questioning glance at Edyn, who shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>LenNokk raised his cup and told the fighters, "Drink the wine of Nokk, the God of our Ivory Moon. May it put fire in your bellies and bravery in your hearts!"</p>
<p>B'Elanna choked down the concoction, noting the way it burned her throat and fell into her stomach like lead. Fortunately, she had a Klingon physiology to lean back on.</p>
<p>"Uh-oh," Edyn murmured nervously, wringing his hands.</p>
<p>"What do you mean 'uh-oh'?" asked B'Elanna, as she wiped her mouth.</p>
<p>"The wine of Nokk is very potent, and I believe you have to down one before each round," Edyn answered, frank concern over his face.</p>
<p>"What? You didn't know I had to drink this stuff?!" demanded B'Elanna as she watched as Edyn was pushed behind the Nokk line-up. The crowd roared as the match was about to begin.</p>
<p>"Yes, well,...this is the first time I've actually done this sort of thing!" Edyn yelled over the heads of the warriors.</p>
<p>"Now you tell me!" B'Elanna growled back, her eyes flashing dangerous with murderous intent.</p>
<p>"Ah, Beylanna behind YOU!"</p>
<p>B'Elanna turned to see Jae'Nokk approach, but not fast enough to dodge the first blow across her face. Neither was she fast enough to avoid the next thrust to her stomach. She staggered away, landing against the wooden wall of staffs which pushed her back into the square arena. Her cheek stung, but she knew the first blow wasn't the cause of her unsteadiness. Everything began to blur as the wine took its effect, and her Klingon physiology wasn't helping. Jae'Nokk curled his lips in contempt, as he observed the way the woman swayed uncontrollably on her feet. Her hands barely held onto her weapons. 'And LenNokk thought this alien was a worthy opponent? How senile could our leader be?'</p>
<p>B'Elanna shook her head to clear it, but her balance remained shaky, and she felt like puking right on the edge of the pit over a couple of boots. Blinking, she saw Jae running up towards her and she swung out to meet him. Their batons cracked loudly together, and the crowd cheered with frenzy as real fighting began. B'Elanna tried hard to defend herself as it rained blow after blow, so she barely had time to strike out offensively. A hit caught her on her elbow, and B'Elanna spun away, trying to shake off the numbness and tingling that traveled down her arm. Jae barreled towards her again with a roar, and B'Elanna hurled the baton at him, end over end like tomahawk, to buy herself some time to recover. Lucky for him, Jae ducked quickly enough, and the baton shot across the arena, and took out one of the other Nokks. The crowd laughed as the warrior fell backwards, knocked out cold, but his presence in the barrier was replaced nonchalantly by another warrior, a female Nokk.</p>
<p>Jae tried to swipe B'Elanna across the face again, but this time B'Elanna blocked it, and slugged him a good right cross in the eye. He dropped back, blinking away the tears, and B'Elanna pressed her advantage even though she was starting to see two of him.  She swung an over-handed blow with her remaining baton in her left hand, but he caught her arm with his own left hand after he discarded a baton aside, and gripped it in an arm lock. His fallen baton was pulled away by one of the Nokk warriors with a staff, and disappeared behind the sea of legs. </p>
<p>Torquing the Klingon's arm outward, Jae pivoted behind B'Elanna and stabbed viciously at her lower back where her kidney laid. B'Elanna screamed in pain as the small blunt end struck her flesh, the nerves in her spine shouting out to her brain. If she had been a full Klingon, her kidneys would have nestled lower in a broader pelvis, protected.</p>
<p>"Maybe you should go back to where you came from, warrior." Jae mocked maliciously, his green eyes blazing. "You deserve nothing from this ritual!"</p>
<p>Jae'Nokk jabbed her again and again, and B'Elanna cried out in frustration as the hurt brought her almost to her knees and the grip kept her immobilized. Gritting her teeth, she crouched low and somersaulted backwards, twisting both their arms and relieving the pressure on hers. Taken by surprise, Jae'Nokk flipped with her to prevent his own elbow from breaking, his grip loosening with the pain, and he landed hard on his backside  B'Elanna stumbled away, supporting the small of her back. </p>
<p>Bending over, she slowed her breathing to control the sharp pangs that still radiated from her injury, and she wondered if she was bleeding internally. The muscles in her back spasmed periodically from the irritated nerves. Time was up when Jae'Nokk flipped to his feet and started another charge at the Klingon. B'Elanna tumbled forward, avoiding the wide swing aimed at her chest, and landed on her feet just as Jae'Nokk passed over her. </p>
<p>"Harrgugh!" Grunting with a vengeance, B'Elanna whipped him hard on his lower back with an audible thud as she stood up, while his momentum took him forward, crashing into the staffs. The crowd had erupted with cheer again when the lieutenant returned the "favor" to the Nokk, but all B'Elanna could hear was the beat of her own heart and the rush of blood in her ears, as her anger grew.</p>
<p>"Paybacks are a bitch," she told him.</p>
<p>Another tall, dark figure entered the back lot of the tavern, just in time to see the vicious exchange occurring in the arena. The figure sat high up on one of the tiered benches that overlooked the left side of the pit, satisfied to see that the expected adversaries were fighting. When it appeared the Klingon was about to lose, the figure rose quickly, tensing. However, the woman warrior had a strong will for survival as well as a competitive spirit, and came back fighting hard. Meanwhile, the cloaked individual at the table noticed the sudden movement out of the corner of an eye, and glanced at the silhouette in recognition. The sight of the shadowy figure brought on unbidden thoughts of punishment due, but for now the focus remained steadfastly on the tournament.</p>
<p>Jae'Nokk turned to face B'Elanna, but he was still clearly reeling from the blow. B'Elanna dragged her feet towards the middle of the ring, as he met her half way. They caught each other's swipes, and grappled back and forth clutching at one another's wrists and rods, snarling at each other.</p>
<p>"Oofffff!" Jae'Nokk grunted. </p>
<p>B'Elanna kicked Jae's right knee out from under him, and his leg smacked against the floor. But he was able to wrench his baton away from the lieutenant, and swept her off her feet with it. B'Elanna rolled away fast, though the wind was knocked out of her, and stood up. Seeing Jae'Nokk run towards her again, she flipped her baton so that she held the straight end, and swung the T-prong to block his attacks. </p>
<p>-Smack!- -SMACK!- -THWACK!-</p>
<p>They traded swings again, as the crowd watched them parry and feint, back and forth across the arena, the dirt kicking up into the air. B'Elanna took another strike against her stomach that pushed her backwards, but she retaliated with straight kick to Jae'Nokk's chin. Her boot cut into the skin of his jaw, and he bled bright red down his neck, staining his jersey.  The Nokk tried a forward thrust to her sternum, but B'Elanna used the opportunity to hook his baton between the T-prong of her stick. With one quick flick of her wrist, she ripped the Nokk's baton out of his grasp, and both adversaries watched as the weapon sailed upwards in a parabolic curve, heading out of the pit. A screen of wooden staffs rose straight up, and blocked the soaring instrument before it could injure a spectator. The baton fell passively to the ground with a dead thump, before it was removed.  </p>
<p>Jae'Nokk recovered from his loss, and kicked the lieutenant's baton out of her hand while she was still distracted. Weaponless, they went at each other with bare-handed hostility, landing a kick on each other's chest and knocking their opponent down simultaneously. When they both hit the ground, the column of warriors pounded their staffs in unison once again, signaling the end of the round.</p>
<p>B'Elanna trod over to her corner of the pit, or at least where she found Edyn waiting for her. He tried to wrap her in a towel, but she pushed him away, too hot and glistening with sweat. He doused her with cool water instead, then wiped her face and arms down, rubbing intently on the muscles to keep them from cramping up. He examined the right side of her face which bore a large, reddened bruise, and compressed the bleeding from her elbow. But she couldn't stand the touch for more than a few seconds, so agitated as she was.</p>
<p>"Beylanna,..." he started, attempting to calm the half-Klingon.</p>
<p>"What?!" she demanded testily, gulping handfuls of water.</p>
<p>"Be careful out there," he replied. "Don't let him get you all riled up."</p>
<p>"Too late for that," she told him, as she paced like a panther trapped in a cage.</p>
<p>Edyn watched in worry, having never seen the young woman so disturbed before. She was not acting like herself at all. Perhaps it was the mixture of the wine, the atmosphere, and what was at stake. Jae'Nokk did nothing to help the situation, as he stared arrogantly from his side of the arena, trying to rally his supporters with the wave of his arm. The Nokk wasn't in great shape himself, after B'Elanna left her mark on his face, which was starting to swell in a few places. The crowd responded uproariously either with cheers or even some jeers, many of them conversing among themselves, no doubt over what had taken place during the first round.</p>
<p>'Stupid idiot,' Edyn reproached the Nokk in his mind, questioning why the ass had been chosen to compete in the first place. 'The blockhead has no sense of honor whatsoever. Now they'll both end up killing each other.'</p>

<p>"I'm gonna beat the living snot out of that jerk," B'Elanna vented, as the Nokk's supporters began to chant his name.</p>
<p>She was just so livid right now. The lieutenant hated bullies, and whenever she encountered one, she wanted nothing better than to teach them a lesson they wouldn't soon forget. And this shithead was asking for it, big time!</p>
<p>"Who is your champion?!" he shouted at the crowd, to which they responded animatedly.</p>
<p>"That yIntagh! I'm gonna rip his head off and shove it up his-" B'Elanna growled, clenching her fists.</p>
<p>"My lovely,.... Please, don't play his game!!" pleaded Edyn, tossing his hands up helplessly, just before the stamping of the staffs initiated another round.</p>
<p>Again, the maidens came into the ring, bearing the wine in goblets. B'Elanna gulped it slower this time, hoping to slow the potent effects of the liquor. When the young ladies departed, the arena was cleared and the two warriors approached each other cautiously. B'Elanna could see that even Jae'Nokk was not immune to the alcohol, in the way his body loosened up.</p>
<p>The fighting that followed in the round was not pretty. It was a drunken mess of blow traded for blow, tit for tat, with the intent on inflicting as much damage as possible. Neither one of the combatants bother to duck or avoid each other's hits. Inevitably, someone's jersey had to be a torn casualty under the circumstances, but fortunately, it wasn't B'Elanna's. At one point in the round, Jae'Nokk landed a body blow just under B'Elanna's diaphragm, seeming to have stunned the Klingon as she stood frozen in mid-motion. The crowd quieted as Jae, sensing his victory, stepped aside, waiting for the woman warrior to topple over.</p>
<p>-BURP!- </p>
<p>Noisy laughter had exploded from the crowd in response after B'Elanna's inadvertent slip, which had only incited Jae'Nokk's antagonism even more.  B'Elanna wiped away the blood that dripped freely down her left brow. If the Doctor saw her now, he'd have a field day with her.  She knew one of her fingers was dislocated, and she forced it back into place with an audible pop. Jae'Nokk was busy nursing his side after B'Elanna had smashed a wicked forearm into his rib cage. Thinking he was too preoccupied, B'Elanna launched into a jump kick, only to be caught on her lower abdomen by a roundhouse kick from Jae.  The Klingon crashed to the floor, but luckily landed unharmed. She rolled away, and managed to flip back onto her feet before Jae'Nokk could stomp his hefty foot on her chest. B'Elanna followed through with a backfist that just caught the Nokk on his cheek. She watched as he backed away with tears stinging his eyes. Finally, the Nokks ended the second round with a resounding smash.</p>
<p>B'Elanna stumbled over to her corner, exhausted by the fighting, and sat on the stool Edyn had stolen. She was aching all over the place, certain there were still a few bones and ligaments out of alignment. Edyn hovered over her pensively, wiping away the blood from her face and smearing some clotting salve into the wounds. He had the distinct impression that a certain pretty, blue-eyed, buxom blonde was going to have his hide when this was all done. He regretted suggesting this foolhardy idea in the first place.</p>
<p>B'Elanna rested her elbows on her knees, trying to catch her breath, knowing the Nokks would start another round soon. She raised her head briefly and looked up at the dais where the EnNokk House sat, watching the match proceedings. The young warriors that surrounded the dais were all speaking excitedly among themselves, mimicking the moves they just saw. But B'Elanna was immediately drawn to the dour expressions on the faces of the EnNokk elders. LenNokk appeared more neutral, but his quietness and posture spoke more volumes. A little confused by her discovery, B'Elanna turned her gaze to EnNokkia, the young lady who had been observing the Klingon for sometime now. The Klingon found a look of slight disappointment in the Nokk's hazel eyes. Dismayed, B'Elanna tore her gaze away from the family.</p>
<p>'Kahless, what a mess this has turned out to be,' she thought to herself.</p>
<p>She had been so angry at Jae'Nokk that she completely forgot her true intentions for entering the tournament. It was supposed to be a noble ritual, but the match had changed into a drunken altercation. Only she and Jae'Nokk were responsible for cheapening the rich cultural expression into a detestable bar room brawl.  She had come here wanting to prove that she was proud of being part Klingon, and to demonstrate her acceptance of her Klingon heritage. Now she had acted dishonorably, and that realization weighed heavily upon her.</p>
<p>At this rate, she would lose, maybe not to Jae'Nokk himself, but to her own past, and the anger she couldn't leave behind. And what about Seven, and her promise to get the Borg back to Voyager. That was the most important thing of all. Suddenly, thinking about Seven brought back memories of the past few days of being with the beautiful blonde, all the obstacles they had face, the laughter they had shared, the touches they had exchanged, and the words they had spoke to each other. At last, her rage calmed, and fell away from her like a broken chain, as it had no meaning anymore. She didn't need her anger to give her courage, though it would always be there. All she really needed was confidence in herself, and knowing the fact that someone else had confidence in her and cared about her. B'Elanna scanned the crowd, wanting so much at that moment to see the young Borg's face, but knowing she would not find her there.</p>
<p>'This was supposed to be a display of skill and honor. And that's what it is going to be.'  B'Elanna swore to herself. </p>
<p>"We should stop this," Edyn told her as he knelt. "Let's stop this, Bey. I mean,...look at what this has done to you."</p>
<p>B'Elanna watched him intently as she toweled herself clean to appear more presentable.</p>
<p>"That's not to say I find you unattractive with the swollen eye and bruised lip. As a matter of fact, it has made you all the more appealing to me, my dear. But I would be willing to give up my commission if you withdraw from the tournament," Edyn persuaded to B'Elanna's amusement.</p>
<p>She patted him reassuringly on the chest to let him know she was all right. Edyn noticed the immediate change in the half-Klingon's demeanor, and moved aside when she stood up. The assembly of warriors lifted their staffs once again, and began the third round without further ado.</p>
<p>Edyn placed a hand on B'Elanna's shoulder before she stepped up to take another goblet of wine. "Ani gave me a message to tell you, when she thought you needed it. She said she believes in you,...and to enjoy yourself..." B'Elanna smiled at him with genuine gratitude.</p>
<p>The crowd stood cheering as the warriors took center stage.  This time, the alcoholic effects of the wine didn't seem to be as debilitating, and B'Elanna concluded her Klingon liver was finally starting to kick in. Instead, the wine gave her a light buzz.  Jae'Nokk, on the other hand, seemed to stumble a bit when he launched out of his corner and moved to the middle of the arena.  He found the impassive expression on his opponent's face slightly intimidating. She no longer had the look of animosity or fury, and that made it harder for him to read her. Jae had thought he would have broken her much earlier, but the woman was resilient, or more like a glutton for punishment.</p>
<p>B'Elanna stretched out the back of her hand in invitation, and waited for his response. Recognizing the gesture, Jae'Nokk crossed her wrist with his own corresponding hand, and they circled each other slowly. The resulting fight resembled little of what had gone before. The adversaries grappled and sparred more, rather than resorting to previous attempts at tearing each other apart, trying to snap one another's bones.  Subsequently, the match became more of a performance where both of them strived to outdo the other in technique. Even the audience sensed the difference in attitude by the combatants, and they began cheering respectfully at the display of skill, instead of rooting boisterously like people at a Hoverball game. Nevertheless, it was evident as the round progressed, the Klingon appeared more in control of her actions, while the young Nokk was challenged by his intoxication and endurance, or lack there of. </p>
<p>Leaning forward, B'Elanna ducked under a very quick cross chop by Jae'Nokk, and kicked up the ball of her foot like a ballerina, feeling it strike something soft. The Nokk stumbled backwards, while the impact sent her body back up into an erect position, ready to engage again. Jae'Nokk later answered that move with one of his own, a nice dropkick to her chest. And there it went, back and forth, but with each passing second, the Klingon became more stimulated and ecstatic about the whole ritual, grinning enthusiastically at her opponent, who was already dragging his feet and looking back at her in amazement.</p>
<p>During the break before the fourth round, the crowd applauded in appreciation for the way the warriors had handled themselves. And B'Elanna hoped that some of the dignity of the tournament was restored. Edyn tried to assess whether the object of his affection was completely plastered, by the way she smiled from ear to ear. He was almost knocked over when B'Elanna clapped him excitedly on the back, and he concluded that his fiery vixen was just happily drunk. Toasting the House, the Klingon swallowed the wine of Nokk eagerly, raring to get back into the match. When she met Jae'Nokk in the middle of the arena, he appeared tipsy but he too grinned. </p>
<p>"Come, Warrior," she beckoned to him.  "Let me show you how we celebrate the drinking of wine in my culture."</p>
<p>Bleary-eyed, she grasped both his arms, and pulled him closer, demonstrating what they were supposed to do. He got the idea, and nodding, clasped her arms tightly as well to prepare himself.  On the count of three, B'Elanna gave the young Nokk a Warrior's Headbutt, and both of them staggered back, dazed, but roaring with enthusiasm. This time the Nokk grabbed B'Elanna's arms and return the headbutt, their heads crashing audibly against each other. The lieutenant shook her head clear from the tremendous impact, and when she opened her eyes again, Jae'Nokk had disappeared.  Apparently, he had dropped bonelessly to the floor after knocking himself out cold against the hard forehead of the Klingon, where she discovered him a few seconds later. She listened to the crowd erupt with cheer as they finally had their champion.</p>
<p>B'Elanna had a difficult time remembering what happened next, as she stood there numb. She found herself surrounded by the assembly of Nokk warriors chanting and thumping their chests. Edyn gently took her by the arm, and humbly led her out of the throng, back up the ramp to present herself before the House of EnNokk to receive her bestowal of honor. When she reached the dais, LenNokk rose out of his chair to greet her, along with the rest of the intimate family.</p>
<p>"I thought we had lost you both," the graying Nokk murmured gravely, giving the half-Klingon a thoughtful look. </p>
<p>"Forgive me if I acted without honor," B'Elanna apologized, ashamed by her initial behavior.</p>
<p>"Thank you for returning our faith in the end," he answered.</p>
<p>"And thank you," he said a bit louder so that the rest of the House, who were watching, could hear.  "For showing our youth what the ritual truly stands for. Over the years, it had become merely a spectator sport that outsiders gambled away their credits on, and the ritual had all but lost its original meaning for my people on this planet. Perhaps now, it will regain some of its cultural significance, if they will remember."</p>
<p>The elders approached their champion, along with a conscious Jae'Nokk, and with benediction, they announced in unison, "Beylanna, Daughter of Miral of the House of Prasba, you have won admiration among our people, and we find you worthy of honor that Nokk himself bestows, with all its privileges."</p>
<p>The circle of Nokks, including Jae'Nokk, bowed deeply in respect for their champion, and B'Elanna, moved by the gesture, returned the bow with Edyn at her side.</p>
<p>"And now, we must celebrate!" declared LenNokk, clapping his hands to summon the wine maidens. "A round of drinks for everyone!"</p>
<p>The audience cheered as the real party started. Music and dancing kept the people busy as the wine and conversation flowed freely. The cloaked figure made its way stealthily through the horde of aliens, unnoticed as it headed towards the unsuspecting Klingon. It was tired of waiting.</p>
<p>Smiling, LenNokk stepped close to B'Elanna, and handed her a scroll. "This contains a poem of your deeds here tonight."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Venerable One," B'Elanna replied, cradling the gift with pride. "I shall value it until the last days of my life."</p>
<p>"There is another issue.... As champion, you have one more privilege. A request, actually, from a lady to spend this evening with our Honored Guest," he added, with a wink, and turned to pull EnNokkia from the circle.</p>
<p>EnNokkia blushed prettily, but moved forward boldly, as the male and female warriors all hushed, waiting for their champion to respond. Before B'Elanna could stop sweating and answer, however, the cloaked figure materialized out from the background, and captured her arm. Everyone, including B'Elanna, tensed at the unexpected threat, but calmly, the figure pulled her hood away, revealing long golden hair that fell softly on slender shoulders.</p>
<p>Seven held B'Elanna's arm possessively. "Your champion will be otherwise preoccupied this evening," she daringly claimed, fixing her patented cool gaze on the Nokk warriors, even as the lieutenant's eyebrows shot up in astonishment.</p>
<p>Edyn hid his grin behind his hand. 'Oh, this just keeps getting better and better,' he chuckled to himself.</p>
<p>The moment of stunned silence that followed was broken suddenly by a gale of laughter from LenNokk, and the rest of the pack joined in lustily, slapping each other uncontrollably on the back. EnNokkia gave Seven a look of jealousy, but even she had to back down from the golden one. She should have known such a warrior would already have a mate.</p>
<p>"This is Annika, my family," B'Elanna introduced, glad that LenNokk found the situation amusing.</p>
<p>"I see," LenNokk replied, as he wiped the tears from his eyes, still chortling, "that you already have a previous engagement. Still, there is one more thing we would like to give you. As the artist for our House, EnNokkia is charged with the task. If your...companion will allow it, please follow her into the Great Hall. She will also show you where you may cleanse yourself."</p>
<p>"That is acceptable," the Borg consented.</p>
<p>Seven arched her brow, releasing B'Elanna's arm, and watched carefully as a befuddled B'Elanna trailed after the young Nokk into the tavern. Hands linked behind her back, Seven approached the big leader of the EnNokk House when she saw B'Elanna disappear through the doorway. There was something she had on her mind that she wished to discuss with the older Nokk.</p>
<p>A little less than an hour later, a fresher looking B'Elanna returned. Seven was in the middle of an arm wrestling match with one of the Nokk youths, when she noticed the half-Klingon making her way through the crowd. She observed suspiciously through narrowing eyes as the lieutenant waddled back from the tavern to the dais, holding her backside with one hand and breathing heavily with pursed lips. Effortlessly, Seven slammed the Nokk's hand down on the table to the young warrior's dismay, ending the match quickly by the time B'Elanna reached her.  Several of the onlookers sighed with adoration, as the sight of the obviously strong, statuesque blonde sent their bosoms heaving.</p>
<p>"Are we done here?" the Borg asked, eager to leave.</p>
<p>"Yes, time to call it a night," B'Elanna agreed, once again wearing her simple Rangoon clothing.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>It was late in the evening already when B'Elanna bid her newfound friends goodnight. She, Seven, and Edyn left the celebration and the drunkenness behind them as they walked out into the cold streets, ready to go home. Edyn had settled the monetary affairs with one of the Nokk elders, as B'Elanna's sponsor, and they asked him to drop off the credits promised to Abcedi in the morning before they parted company. Afterwards, B'Elanna and Seven found themselves alone in the quiet of the darkness as they trudged back to Dannan's house. The ex-drone looked over at B'Elanna who seemed so small at the moment. The remnants of the fight were still plainly evident on her face and her tired appearance. It would not be good if Moka saw B'Elanna looking this way, and the half-Klingon was sure to receive a lecture from both of their adopted caretakers. </p>
<p>B'Elanna didn't know when it happened, but by the time they reached the corner at the end of the block, she found her hand comfortably in Seven's. The moment was broken when they turned the corner. Five hulking shapes were waiting for them.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>The half-Klingon could just make out the dark silhouettes that stood beyond the cone of light streaming from the lamp above the abandoned street. She could hear the clicks of guns being loaded, and felt the tingling down her spine that told her some of those guns were aimed at her, and the rest at Seven. When the lieutenant tried to backstep slowly with Seven, the figures spread out to cover their escape. B'Elanna released the Borg's hand, setting herself up so that she could pull the disrupter from her holster, hidden at the small of her waist. </p>
<p>The dark figure Seven recognized earlier sauntered forward, though his gun hung loosely in his grasp at his side. The man sniffed insolently at the air before he addressed them. His familiar, yet haunting voice cracked the cold silence, and for a moment, the Borg almost lost herself in the memory of her previous helplessness.</p>
<p>"Well,...," he began, "looks like we meet again." -Sniff- </p>
<p>B'Elanna tightened her jaw. Even in her slightly intoxicated haze, she immediately identified the cowardly scum that held them at gunpoint. The nefarious figure finally walked into the light, revealing the same yellow skinned jackass who had attacked them before - Kal, plus his riffraff band. Gradually, B'Elanna placed herself in front of the young Borg, wanting instantly to keep Kal as far away from her as possible, and remove Seven from his fetid presence.</p>
<p>"You know Orn, of course. But you haven't met the rest of my crew yet, have you?" he carried on, wanting to demonstrate his control over the captives in front of his men.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" B'Elanna demanded, cutting to the chase. She was not in the best mood for another confrontation tonight.</p>
<p>With his crew at his command, Kal remained unshaken by her tone. In fact, he was going to enjoy beating the insubordinate life out of the troublesome female until she became his lap dog. Then he'd take the other female in front of her just to torment her. The brawny Orn sighed internally. He just wanted to get this whole encounter over with, since he couldn't understand what the big deal was, and why Kal was so obsessed with the two women.</p>
<p>"We want you to hand over your winnings, and come with us," replied Kal, leering at them with his crooked smile, caught up in his own cleverness. "I've been expecting you both."</p>
<p>To B'Elanna's dismay, Seven stepped protectively in front of her, facing Kal openly.  The Klingon slowly began to reach for her weapon.</p>
<p>"I believe you are mistaken. It is we who have been expecting you," Seven told the offensive man.</p>
<p>With that statement, a swarm of shadows emerged from the background and converged on the street corner, surrounding the group. Kal glanced around him as his men were confronted by more than twenty burly Nokk warriors armed to the teeth with canon rifles. </p>
<p>'And I believe I'm about to swoon for this woman,' B'Elanna mused, gazing at the young Borg in worship, her heart about to burst with pride.</p>
<p>Kal's men looked around nervously, and waited for instructions. They were completely out-numbered and out-gunned by Nokks, of all people. Kal convinced them that capturing these women would mean a big payoff, but he did not tell them that the women were allied to the Houses. </p>
<p>"This is not your concern!" Kal hissed, peering at the dark shadows left and right. "This is a matter between us!" he indicated pointing to Seven, B'Elanna, and himself.</p>
<p>"That is incorrect," the unflappable Borg informed him. "When you chose to threaten their champion, you challenged the bounds of their honor. You are not in control of this situation."</p>
<p>"Drop your weapons," Seven ordered Kal's men. "Resistance is FUTILE."</p>
<p>The clamor of weapons falling to the ground echoed through the neighborhood as Kal's men disarmed themselves, hoping to avoid retribution. A tall, brownish-redheaded Nokk came out of the darkness and went to B'Elanna. </p>
<p>"I am Mae'Nokk," he introduced himself respectfully.  "The Great LenNokk wishes you, our Champion, a pleasant evening. Do not concern yourselves any longer. We will take care of this...problem."</p>
<p>The burly warriors circled the Mewks, and took custody of the lowlife band, even as Kal's loud and annoying protests went unheeded. Then, the young Nokk bowed deeply to Seven before he joined the rest of his noble people as they receded back into the shadows. When he too disappeared into the night, they heard him murmur softly.</p>
<p>"My brother sends his regards, Champion...."</p>

<p>Seven and B'Elanna made their way slowly back to Dannan's house in the icy night, with nothing heard but the crunching of pebbles under their feet. Though outwardly the lieutenant remained tough, Seven knew she was injured enough so that her normal pace was hindered. The ex-drone could hear the quiet winces and occasional deep breaths in attempt to hide pain.</p>
<p>"I thought you promised me you wouldn't go there," B'Elanna asked, turning her head to glance at Seven.</p>
<p>"You requested that I not go there, but I only promised not to be seen, at least, not during the tournament," answered Seven. "If you recall, I am very literal."</p>
<p>B'Elanna chuckled, shaking her head at how the Borg managed to twist things around. </p>
<p>"How did you know Kal...? What did you say...? LenNokk&#133;. How did you...?"  B'Elanna fumbled over her questions, at a loss for words.</p>
<p>"I.......improvised," Seven replied, her lips quirked, as they reached the gate to the house. B'Elanna smiled in return, realizing being with Seven would always involve a bit of surprise every now and then, and she liked it.</p>
<p>The lights in the common room were on, bathing the front enclosure with soft illumination. Quietly, they opened the door to the home, careful not wanting to disturb anyone sleeping inside. Dannan sat alone at the long table, facing the entry, when they walked in. B'Elanna halted just inside the door, wondering what the good-hearted man was thinking. Dannan rubbed the stubble on his chin as he looked at the young woman, ay women, he had come to know well over the past few days. He carefully took in the dark circles under the lieutenant's eyes, one of them swollen, the cut above her brow, and reddened lips, but otherwise, she looked alive and in one piece. He stood up and walked over to the half-Klingon, then wordlessly, embraced her for a brief moment. </p>
<p>Looking away, he whispered to them, "Well, looks like everything's okay. I'll get you some healing packs before you go to bed."</p>
<p>He clasped Seven's hand gently for a second before he left the room. Seven turned back to B'Elanna, and saw wet tears glistening in the half-Klingon's eyes. Without further delay, B'Elanna went straight to their room, weary of the long day, with its emotional roller-coaster, and wanting only to fall into bed. Seven followed her in after obtaining the healing gel packs from Dannan, and closed the door. By then, the Klingon had dropped her holster, cloak, and boots on the floor, and was splayed out on the cot, lying on her belly. Frowning with disapproval, Seven walked over to the resting woman and started pulling her clothes off. Too exhausted to object, she let the Borg remove her clothing, vaguely aware that Seven was not stopping when she reached her underwear. When Seven finally slid the remaining clothing off, she paused.</p>
<p>"I forgot about this..." Seven spoke hesitantly.</p>
<p>"What?" B'Elanna asked in alarm, suddenly remembering where Seven had visual access to, and wondering what exactly she meant.</p>
<p>"This...," she answered, brushing her hand lightly over the triangle.</p>
<p>"Hhsss, ow!" B'Elanna winced, grabbing onto Seven's wrist to keep her from touching the tender area. "It's still a little sore."</p>
<p>B'Elanna had thought she spent an eternity under EnNokkia's ministrations, and afterwards, she felt she could barely walk. The Klingon had to admit, however, she was impressed, and the girl was very skillful. It was one of the most erotic experiences she had ever had in her entire life, though bathing Seven was at the top of the list.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry.... I will be gentle," Seven replied, trying not to grin.</p>
<p>"How did you know I got a tattoo?" B'Elanna uttered through the pillow, letting go of her forearm.</p>
<p>"I was not completely certain, but I did notice your opponent appeared well-decorated on his upper torso."</p>
<p>"Mmm..." came the muffled response.</p>
<p>Gingerly, she placed a healing pack on the tattoo, but after she had gotten a better look at the intricate design of the EnNokk crest, where it had been etched just at the apex of B'Elanna's firm buttocks. She also examined the Klingon head to toe, making note of all the bruises, cuts, and contusions among other things. B'Elanna had a rather large contusion on the left side of the small of her back, and Seven covered it with another pack, hoping it would help speed the mending. Silently, she ran the tricorder over B'Elanna's body, and sighed deeply when she read the reassuring findings. She thought her cardiovascular systems had ceased to function when she watched as the lieutenant was attacked brutally during the first round.</p>
<p>"I did it...," B'Elanna murmured, turning her face toward the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>"Did what?" Seven asked in a hushed voice, as she knelt down, softly stroking the tired woman's back.</p>
<p>"I showed them that I am a Klingon warrior...."  B'Elanna opened her eyes for a second and peered at Seven.</p>
<p>"Yes," the Borg answered, nodding as she bent down, and placed a kiss on her forehead.</p>
<p>Seven whispered for her to go to sleep, and watched as B'Elanna's eyelids drooped shut before she draped a blanket over the lieutenant. Had someone told her a couple of weeks ago that she would be making such small gestures of affection and compassion, she would have responded with disbelief and cynicism at her own capabilities. But being around B'Elanna Torres made such thoughts and actions natural, almost instinctual to her now. Turning down the lights, Seven stepped quietly out of their quarters, and heard shuffling noises coming from the common room. She walked through the archway and found Moka busy at the hearth, though the hour was late. The ex-drone took the shawl off the back of a chair, and wrapped it around the shoulders of the small, dear woman that had spent so much of her time caring for their daily needs. Moka smiled, knowing just who the person standing behind her was.</p>
<p>"Is Bey asleep?" she asked, removing the baked treats from the oven.</p>
<p>"Yes. Did we wake you when we entered?" Seven inquired, worried they had disturbed the woman.</p>
<p>"No, I couldn't sleep knowing you both were still outside, at the tournament." Moka indicated to Seven to sit at the table as she brought over the plate of snacks for them to eat.</p>
<p>"We did not intend to cause you and Dannan any distress. You both have given us much assistance for the past several days, and it has been...comforting to live here," Seven told her sincerely. "I do not know the words to expression our appreciation for all you have done."</p>
<p>"Oh, child, it has been no trouble at all. Enjoyed the company, yes we have," she replied, trying to put Ani at ease.  "I'm certain it hasn't been easy for either of you being stranded here on this planet away from your family. Just glad that the two of you were stranded together."</p>
<p>Seven stopped her munching, and glanced at Moka questioningly when she heard the last comment. It was unexpected, and sounded strange to her own ears. It surprised her to no end these past few days how her feelings had changed, or rather grown towards the lieutenant. Moka saw her expression, and knew instantly it was something she had to pursue. She didn't know much about robots, technology, space travel, and such, but she knew how to deal with relationships.</p>
<p>"You are not glad that you are here with Bey?" she asked.</p>
<p>Startled out of her reverie, Seven answered, "No, I am...grateful."</p>
<p>"I thought so. You two seem so close, sometimes practically joined at the hip like congenital twins," joked Moka.</p>
<p>Again, Seven found herself pausing to analyze the observation. "Our relationship would have been described as the opposite prior to our arrival on this planet. Our previous interactions were more...antagonistic." The ex-drone was almost ashamed to admit it.</p>
<p>It was Moka's turn to throw a questioning look. Now her interest was truly peaked.  "Antagonistic?...  Hmm, so different from each other were you then, ay?...I suppose I can see that," Moka pretended to concede, tugging on a earlobe as she pursed her lips in thought.</p>
<p>Seven quirked her brow, and replied, "On the contrary, Bey and I have many attributes in common. We both have proficiency in engineering, interest in the acquisition of knowledge, and we are both hybrids of two cultures, one of which we share. Human.... However, we each have had problems reconciling our two cultures, and as a result, that has caused us difficulties in our relationships with other members of our family."</p>
<p>She continued, "And Bey is intelligent, outspoken, moral, and truthful, characteristics which I find admirable...."  </p>
<p>Seven stopped her herself suddenly, wondering just when she had come to such conclusions about the lieutenant. Despite their argumentative interactions, they often worked on the same projects the Captain assigned them to. And Seven had taken ample opportunity to observe the Klingon during her romantic relationship with Tom Paris. Perhaps, she had discovered a kinship with B'Elanna, one that she didn't cared to admit in the past. </p>
<p>"If you share so much in common, why were you both at odds before?" Moka pressed.</p>
<p>"My family finds the Borg detestable for their ruthless pursuit of the assimilation of millions of individuals and the destruction of species. Many of them have lost friends and relatives," Seven explained, her voice pained. "When I was a member of the Borg, I had participated in such acts, and when I was freed, I had difficulty adjusting to my new life. Some of my behavior and appearance may serve to remind them of the Borg, including Bey." </p>
<p>"Surely, they cannot blame you?" Moka asked, doubtful that her family could not see the young woman for who she truly was. She gazed at the young woman warmly, hoping to ease Ani's own self-incrimination by letting her fondness for the young woman show through.</p>
<p>"I am Borg, and I have done things all Borg are guilty of. I will always be Borg..." Seven said bitterly, as she looked down.</p>
<p>Moka moved her chair over quickly, faster that Seven could believe she was able to, and cupped the Borg's face with a weathered hand so that Seven would look at her. </p>
<p>"See yourself negatively do you? No, not right. Would be an injustice, Ani. You are your own individual. What you choose to do with your life now is the only thing that matters. And I do not think Bey sees you that way, at least, not anymore," insisted Moka. "No, I KNOW she does not. Look in her eyes, find the truth for yourself if you still deny it."</p>
<p>Self-conscious, Seven blushed at the thought of being close to B'Elanna. Even now she felt the lieutenant's absence though the half-Klingon was exactly where she had left her. Moka put her arm around Seven's shoulders. Young love was painful, but it was also exhilarating and passionate if she remembered correctly. And it needed encouragement. </p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>The ex-drone crept into the room quietly as not to wake the slumbering woman. B'Elanna laid there on the cot, not having moved one inch since she fell asleep. Seven leaned over to examine B'Elanna's wounds which appeared to have improved in the short amount of time. She brushed her hand over the Klingon's back, feeling the wonderfully smooth coffee skin at her fingertips.</p>
<p>'So...perfect,' she sighed mentally, despite the scattered bruises that colored the skin.</p>
<p>She wondered what it would feel like to have her bare skin next to B'Elanna's, but she refrained from finding out as she changed into her bedclothes. Without a sound, Seven slipped into bed and placed herself as close to B'Elanna as possible so that she could feel the warm heat that radiated from the strong body. B'Elanna must have somehow sensed the presence of her body because the Klingon turned her face away from the edge of the bed towards the young woman, and shifted her arm slightly until it bumped into Seven's side. When B'Elanna moaned her discontent, the blonde covered the small distance between them and gently lifted the lieutenant's head onto her shoulder, and wrapped an arm around the supple back. Finally, tired herself, Seven fell into contented sleep, holding the woman she was in love with.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Lt. B'Elanna Torres, Chief Engineer of the Federation Starship Voyager, half-Klingon was scared witless about what to do next. She woke up on this particular morning, nestled softly on what she thought was a comfortable bedding, for a few seconds before she realized what she was really cuddled up to. A perfumed bosom, a generous one she might add. Cracking open an eye, she gazed down at the cleavage hidden precariously by a low neckline, which brought to mind various uncensored imagery.</p>
<p>'Okay. Maybe I can move while Seven's asleep,' she considered, up until she felt Seven's hand move, lightly scratching her back in slow circles. 'Damn! Nix that.... Oh Kahless, that feels soooooo good...'</p>
<p>Things would have still been less embarrassing if B'Elanna didn't realize next that she was completely naked, not a stitch of clothing on, and in such a compromising position. She might as well have planted a flag on Seven while she was atop the Borg. </p>
<p>'Why does this keep happening???'</p>
<p>Of course, the fact that her knee was wedged between Seven's thighs didn't help matters all that much either. Well, she guessed it wasn't so bad since Seven had her nightgown on. But then again, the situation might have been salvageable if only the blonde's gown hadn't ridden up her thigh during the course of the night. As it were now, B'Elanna's sensitive flesh was pressed against a very toned leg, and the heat from the connection had generated a great deal of sweat between them, making the area sticky. As if it weren't hard enough for her to keep a respectful relationship with the young woman.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Seven analyzed the multitude of responses she detected from B'Elanna, the quickened beating of her heart that vibrated against her own chest, the increased respiratory rate, and the tensing of the Klingon's abdominal muscles she felt on her hip. When she had awakened earlier, Seven discovered their bodies intertwined, and relaxed into the embrace. She waited in amusement for B'Elanna's reaction, knowing full well the lieutenant would be flustered at the possible impropriety of the situation, a concept she found ridiculous. She did not expect, however, that her own body would respond in kind to the sensation of B'Elanna's hot, wet skin next to hers and to the pressure she felt between her legs, where it had begun to ache.</p>
<p>B'Elanna lifted her head and glanced at Seven, who felt the movement, and returned the look. There seemed to be an interminable amount of silence as both of them wondered if this was what it felt like to wake up to each other as lovers. B'Elanna reached up hesitantly, placing a chaste kiss on Seven's lips. The Borg's eyes widened slightly, expressing her pleasure at the act that spoke of familiarity.</p>
<p>"Good morning," the lieutenant murmured, still holding the gaze, relishing the effect of her kiss.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Bey," Seven whispered back, inspecting the Klingon's delicate features and noting with satisfaction that the injuries were disappearing.</p>
<p>"Do I look that bad?" asked B'Elanna with humor in her tone as she sat up, wrapping a sheet shyly around herself, and felt the tight knots in her back.</p>
<p>The shift caused their legs to disentangle, and they both sighed deeply when their intimate contact broke, the cool air drifting between their bodies. Seven felt the sweat on her thigh beginning to evaporate.</p>
<p>"No.... You are beautiful," Seven told her as she sat up too, bring their faces close.</p>
<p>"So are you," B'Elanna replied instinctively, her body flushing in reaction to the entire situation. </p>
<p>B'Elanna rubbed her lips distractedly as she contemplated the words she needed to say to Seven. The Borg seemed to sense her introspection and waited patiently. </p>
<p>"Seven," B'Elanna started, wanting the woman to understand who exactly she was addressing, and not the persons they were pretending to be.  "I just want to tell you how much I've come to appreciate who you are, after having gotten to know you better these past several days. I'm just sorry it didn't happen earlier on board Voyager, instead of here, under such forced circumstances..."</p>
<p>"I wish I hadn't been so blind-" B'Elanna couldn't finish as slender fingers stopped her lips.</p>
<p>"I do not want apologies. We have both misjudged each other," Seven answered, not removing her fingers as they traced the sensual mouth.</p>
<p>"I.... I like you, Seven. I like you very much," B'Elanna murmured, looking into large blue eyes with her heart exposed. She didn't want to overwhelm the young woman, and risk losing the bond they had formed so recently. </p>
<p>Seven was stunned for an instant as she processed the words, but slowly her eyes lighted with the smile that touched her features.</p>
<p>"I...like you very much, as well, B'Elanna," Seven acknowledged, moving closer to her objective. Moka was right. B'Elanna had feelings for her, the ones that she had wished her entire human existence for.</p>
<p>"I'm glad we're friends..."</p>
<p>"We're more than just friends," murmured Seven.</p>
<p>B'Elanna retreated slightly. "And Captain Janeway?" she asked, steadying herself for the answer.</p>
<p>Seven gaze curiously at B'Elanna, realizing that the lieutenant was inquiring about her relationship with the Captain. It seemed important to the half-Klingon, so she answered truthfully.</p>
<p>"The Captain and I are friends, and we have a close personal relationship. However, it does not preclude my current relationship with you, B'Elanna. I want to be with you," Seven replied, moving single-mindedly towards those lips again. </p>
<p>This time, B'Elanna didn't retreat as the Borg slipped her enhanced hand behind her head, entangling it through her hair, and pulled her in for a deep, searing kiss. Her heart was filled with indescribable joy knowing that Seven felt the same way and wanted the same thing. She let Seven do the exploring with her usual efficiency, and pretty soon, she felt herself pressed downward towards the pillows. B'Elanna jumped briefly when her back landed on the cot, and Seven detected the movement. Concerned, the ex-drone unceremoniously turned the Klingon over and pulled the sheet down to examine her back.</p>
<p>"Your injuries..."</p>
<p>"I'm alright, Seven. I was just surprised by the packs poking into my back," B'Elanna laughed softly.</p>
<p>Seven peeled away the healing packs, and found that the lieutenant was recovering quickly. The bruises and cuts were only faintly noticeable.</p>
<p>"The swelling from you contusion has decreased, and the skin decoration has healed," Seven noted.</p>
<p>A little of her jealous feelings returned when she pictured the Nokk leaning over her lieutenant, touching such an intimate area. She ran her hand over the intricate tattoo, and asked, "What happened after you followed the female into the tavern?"</p>
<p>B'Elanna reveled in the sensation of her touch. "You mean EnNokkia? She led me to the baths, and I cleaned up before her assistants came and showed me to her studio. All I did was lay there while she marked me."</p>
<p>"Were you unclothed?" Seven asked, gliding her fingertips along the Klingon's spine. </p>
<p>B'Elanna shivered under her strokes. "Where I needed to be," she answered vaguely, remembering how she laid face down on the couch, with only a towel covering her breasts as EnNokkia tended to her.</p>
<p>"Did she sit here?" Seven leaned her upper body over the back of the Klingon's thighs, and pulled the sheet lower, exposing the round derriere. She watched as the shallow dimples on either side of the muscular buttocks pinched when the lieutenant squirmed.</p>
<p>"Yes," B'Elanna whimpered, recalling the seductive, feminine surroundings, the fresh flowers scattered around her, and the attention she had received. </p>
<p>"Did she touch you here?" Seven questioned, placing her warm hands on the pliant cheeks, feeling the firmness under her palms.</p>
<p>"A few times," B'Elanna admitted, lost in the caress. The hands left her rump as Seven stood up abruptly.</p>
<p>"I see," Seven said, her tone hardened. With steel in her gaze, she told B'Elanna, "Perhaps, you would like to obtain more skin decorations while you are here, since you seemed to have enjoyed the experience."</p>
<p>And with that, she left in a huff to the washroom. B'Elanna plopped down into the pillows, half amused, half contrite that the Borg was mad again.</p>
<p>'So, my beautiful Borg's jealous.' She winced, 'I guess I should have known Seven's not like Tom, who wouldn't have minded a play-by-play of a little girl-on-girl action.... I guess I better try harder to woo Seven.'</p>
<p>B'Elanna didn't mind as she eyed the door where Seven had left through. After all, she was already Seven-whipped. Besides, she enjoyed a challenge.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Edyn whistled on his way to Dannan's place. He had just dropped off the credits to the freighter captain, and was glad to hear that the man still honored his arrangements with Bey. He was anxious to see how the half-Klingon was doing after last night's fight. Edyn entered through the gate and knocked on the door until Dannan opened it. He found them all sitting at the table, enjoying breakfast together.</p>
<p>"Hello, hello. What's this? One of Moka's hearty breakfasts?" he inquired, setting his sights on the stack of fresh bacon, and his nose twitched as the smells wafted up to his nostrils. "Mmm...koli fruit crepes with fresh whipped cream, johish sausages, fried gilka eggs, diqui melons, and..."</p>
<p>Dannan laughed at the moocher, and invited him to join them. Edyn grabbed a seat by his prized fighter, since Ani seemed to be sitting a bit farther away this morning next to Moka. He winked at Bey as he nibbled on a piece of bacon, while she rolled her eyes in mirth.</p>
<p>"Morning, my bumpy beauty, and my lush lovely," he greeted Seven as well, wiggling his brows at her. "I gave the money to the pilot."</p>
<p>That caught their attention as all eyes pinned on him. Edyn continued, "He said he'll start the communiqu&eacute; as soon as he gets out of orbit."</p>
<p>"That's wonderful news," Dannan noted, even though inside, he lacked the enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"He should be moving through the sectors you think your family will pass through, if they haven't already. He's leaving in another ten parsecs. But he also said that he had room for one more passenger," Edyn added offhandedly, but he knew exactly what he was saying.</p>
<p>Everyone stopped eating while Seven and B'Elanna looked at each other intently. Edyn spied back and forth between the two women.</p>
<p>Finally, Seven answered, "We will leave together or not at all."</p>
<p>Smiling, B'Elanna took another bite of her crepe, and the rest of them resumed eating, and talked about idle things. The laughter and chatter inside the house could be heard from the streets. Even Fessi wandered over to the window, looking inside to find what all the commotion was about. </p>
