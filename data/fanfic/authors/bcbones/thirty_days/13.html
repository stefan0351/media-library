<p>B'Elanna woke first the next morning. She guessed that Seven still wasn't used to the act of sleeping, and probably needed all the rest she could get. The ex-drone was holding her from behind as she did when they went to sleep, with the arm B'Elanna was resting her head on wrapped around the Klingon's sternum, and the other draped over her waist. Seven's hand at her stomach had inadvertently slipped between the folds of her sarong, B'Elanna discovered when she tried to slide her hips and legs off the bed. Now it rubbed against her bare belly every time she moved away, feeling like soft caresses. Cautiously, B'Elanna pulled Seven's arms down to her sides, and made her quiet escape before Seven woke up.</p>
<p>Seven opened her eyes and sighed. She had felt the lieutenant shift in her arms for some time, but pretended to be asleep for a little while longer. She did not intend to use subterfuge, but she did not wish to startle B'Elanna. It seemed the only way she could continue the physical contact between them was when B'Elanna allowed it or when it was not deliberate. Reluctantly, Seven sat up in bed, but stared at the comfortable covers, the one place that seemed to permit prolonged touching.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Moka stood at the stove, stirring the breakfast porridge. The diminutive Rangoon woman, dressed in a long smock and coarse apron for the cold early morning, took pleasure in cooking a good hearty meal for her young chicklets. She heard the sounds of footfalls and opening doors, and noted they would soon emerge from their cozy room. It had been a long time since she and Dannan had so much life in their house, and she promised that while it remained so, she would enjoy the warmth of the company. The company, two strangers, that had entered their lives so abruptly, were a mismatched pair upon appearances. And they were certainly more than what they appeared to be, she and Dannan supposed. But she rationalized Bey and Ani must have had their reasons for keeping their history vague. The skill and knowledge these two women possessed were far more complicated than what could be found in this part of space. But despite their complexity, she recognized to good beings when she saw them.</p>
<p>On this morning, Bey snuck out to the common room, still in her sleeping clothes.  She greeted Moka politely and poked around the dishes already hot and lying on the table. Moka slapped her hand away when she reached for a koli fruit crepe, and chided her, good-naturedly however, for not waiting for Ani. Laughing, Bey hopped away like a child caught being naughty and went back inside to rouse the blonde, so that she could get to her breakfast. Finally, Bey returned, dragging the still sleepy, statuesque girl in tow towards the food. </p>
<p>Though Ani was noticeably full-grown, and her formal tone and often impassive bearing presented a certain maturity, Moka found her too be quite innocent all the same. The girl was full of questions, but that didn't annoy Moka at all. Ani was sweet, intelligent, and possessed a quick though subtle wit that Moka enjoyed, as her own sense of humor was quite dry. It was no wonder that Bey acted so protective towards Ani, especially with her recent bout of illness. Moka thanked her gods that Ani was alright. She couldn't bear to lose another innocent under this house, nor see another person going through the same loss Dannan had, when her daughter died.</p>
<p>After breakfast, the girls went about the house trying to help with as many chores as they could before Dannan and Edyn got back from town. It was amusing to observe the elaborate dance being performed in front of her. The more Bey tried to be solicitous, the more Ani played up the physical need for assistance yet still declined it. Moka snickered wickedly. She wished they'd just get it over with, ah, rather she meant get over it, and just admit their feelings towards each other. It was obvious to her eye how in love they were with one another. Moka shooed them back into their room to change before the menfolk came back, giving Edyn an undeserved view of his fantasy.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>"You're not going, Ani," B'Elanna ordered, walking over to her clothes hung on the back of the chair across the room.</p>
<p>"I wish to see this tavern for myself so that I may analyze the potential dangers," Seven replied stubbornly.</p>
<p>"It'll only draw more attention in town if both of us were walking around together," said B'Elanna shaking her head.</p>
<p>"That is not a logical excuse. Your facial distinction has already been exposed. You will need someone to assist you if there is trouble."  Seven stepped in front of the Klingon, blocking her from moving away from their conversation. She did not want a repeat of their argument last night, but she wasn't going to be left behind again today.</p>
<p>B'Elanna lifted her eyes to look at Seven. She kept her temper in check this time, having no desire to hurt the Borg again with an outburst.  She knew Seven was just trying to look out for her, in own her Borg way. </p>
<p>"Ani, I don't have time for this. Edyn is going to be here soon, and I need to go with him to present myself to the Nokk house before tonight. Besides, he's already registered me." She rotated and walked away to the bed and laid out her clothes to change.</p>
<p>"I still do not approve of this arrangement. Reconsider..., please," she added, her voice lowering.</p>
<p>"I know you don't like this, but I can't back out now. I'd have no honor if I did," B'Elanna answered, fiddling with the clothes on the bed.</p>
<p>"You were not concerned with your Klingon honor and tradition before," Seven responded. </p>
<p>B'Elanna breathed deeply, somewhat stunned by the bluntness, and dipped her head ruefully. It was true, what Seven said. She had been almost ashamed of her Klingon heritage growing up on Kessicks IV. But despite her rebellion against it, her mother had in fact ingrained in her the culture and beliefs even though she tried to avoid as much of it in her life as possible. </p>
<p>Noticing the change in the lieutenant's mood suddenly, Seven surmised she had said something wrong. Promptly, she added, "I did not mean it the way that it sounded."</p>
<p>Seven walked up behind B'Elanna and wrapped her arms around the woman's shoulders, wanting to convey her deep feelings for the lieutenant. "I only wish that you do not fight. I cannot bear to see you injured," she explained, her tone worried.</p>
<p>"That's okay. I know what you meant," B'Elanna replied stoically, turning around in the circle of Seven's arms. "It's the truth.... But it's not like I haven't benefited from my Klingon side all these years. I guess maybe I feel it's time to recognize and accept this part of myself."</p>
<p>Taking B'Elanna's face into her hands, she moved closer and told her, "It is a part of you that makes you unique. And it is your uniqueness which I find...attractive."  </p>
<p>Seven ran her thumb over the Klingon's full lower lip, as B'Elanna's heart began to race. Seven's ability to melt her with words was uncanny. Eyes hooded, the Borg leaned in as B'Elanna stood immobilized, staring, and kissed the lieutenant. Seven felt inept by her lack of experience as her lips fluttered over B'Elanna's lightly, even though she had witnessed such displays a hundred times on Voyager. Seven felt hands running up her back, finally resting below her shoulders, pressing her closer. </p>
<p>B'Elanna heard the roaring of her blood in her ears as her passion for Seven began to erupt anew. The soft lips against hers tasted sweet, and she wanted to consume them, and the rest of Seven.  She kissed the blonde passionately, and she moved further to deepen the contact.</p>
<p>Seven felt B'Elanna tongue's lick her lips fleetingly before it began to tease them open. She seemed to get the idea, and opened her mouth slightly, allowing the insistent but seductive tongue to slip in and caress her own. Seven moaned as B'Elanna explored her mouth, their tongues tangoing slowly while B'Elanna took the lead. She wasn't even aware that she was lying on her back now, on the bed with the half-Klingon poised on her elbows above her. She was enjoying the new feelings even if it seemed as though B'Elanna was intent on kissing her senseless. Her body moved on its own accord as she tried unsuccessfully to process the overwhelming sensations from every nerve, not that she was complaining. B'Elanna bit Seven's lower lip gently before releasing it when they finally broke apart for air. No words were spoken as their mutual attractions were finally being expressed. The Klingon entangled her fingers in the silky, golden locks, stroking the hair at her temples, as Seven placed her hands on the compact waist. B'Elanna bent down to kiss Seven again, as her passion began to build.  </p>
<p>Seven stopped her, and pushed her off slightly, noticing that the folds of B'Elanna's sarong had parted and revealed a glimpse of the toned, athletic thighs, her white undergarment, and flat stomach. She reached for the tie on the left side that closed the sarong, wanting to do more exploration of her own.  The folds loosened and fell open partially, though still hiding the round globes of B'Elanna's breasts from her gaze. The Borg brushed her fingers along the muscular yet smooth abdomen, as B'Elanna lowered herself over the blonde, devouring the supple lips again. Seven heard B'Elanna gasp quietly when she reached the undersides of the ample, perky breasts, that were a perfect handful for her long hands, and squeezed them slightly. It incited the Klingon's lust even more, and B'Elanna pulled at the helm of Seven's gown, wanting the girl naked immediately. Seven took the hint, and raised her butt off the bed, pulling the gown upwards while B'Elanna watched as the gown slipped away, revealing the slender legs and lean belly. The Klingon licked her lips in anticipation, ready to latch onto the first nipple that bared itself to her, as she slid one hand up a milky thigh.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. "Girls, are you still fooling around in there? We should get to town soon," Dannan said through the door.</p>
<p>B'Elanna sat up instantly, and glanced at the door, blushing with guilt at what she had been about to do. The quick motion flashed Seven a profile of her boob and a small but pert, light brown-rosy nipple.</p>
<p>They heard Edyn's muffled, bawdy response. "Oh, let them fool around."</p>
<p>A muffled smack was heard, followed by an "Ow!"</p>
<p>"We're coming," B'Elanna replied.</p>
<p>'I'll bet,' thought Edyn, avoiding another hit on the head from Moka's broom.</p>
<p>B'Elanna felt like she was a teenager again, having been caught in her room by her roommate doing something naughty with another cadet. She was about ravish the young drone into unconsciousness, though exactly how, she wasn't sure. She wrapped her sarong back around herself and hopped off the bed. She picked up her clothes that had fallen on the floor, and proceeded to dress, shyly working around the sarong. Seven sighed disappointedly at the interruption and propped herself on her elbows, watching B'Elanna scramble into her pants. She got up and proceeded to put on her beige leggings, hazel gown, and sandals. B'Elanna glanced longingly over at the tall figure, knowing she couldn't leave things the way they were. When Seven turned towards the door, she found B'Elanna in front of her. </p>
<p>B'Elanna gazed at Seven warmly and took her right hand into one of her own. "We'll talk about everything when we get back, I promise," she said.</p>
<p>Pleased, Seven smiled coyly and nodded.</p>
<p>"But I want you to go with Dannan this afternoon, and meet up with the freighter pilot."</p>
<p>Seven was about to protest, but B'Elanna stalled her. "Dannan might not know exactly what we need from the pilot. You have to help him in case the pilot tries to renegotiate. I'm not sure how long this presentation stuff with the Nokks is going to last."</p>
<p>The ex-drone pouted a bit, but acquiesced.  "I will comply."</p>
<p>B'Elanna chuckled at how Seven could be so adorable. She didn't let go of Seven's hand when she lead her out of their room.  Of course, Moka and Dannan noted the obvious display of affection, but it wasn't really anything they didn't already observe before or hadn't predicted. Edyn waggled his brows at B'Elanna, who glowered back at him. He shrugged his shoulders as if to reply that he was only male.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Dannan covered her head with a thin hooded cloak before he and Seven walked into the seedy establishment. It was loud inside as the clientele were raising a raucous while a female band was playing synthesized music, and singing with annoyingly high pitched voices in quick repetitive phrases. The lead singers were half-dressed twin humanoid females sashaying across the stage in translucent veils. Large, black, rectangular spots ran down their sides, all the way down their legs, and their long braided hair swung back and forth with their movements. Occasionally, they allowed a few of the bolder audience to reach out and stroke them on their thighs. Dannan and Seven made their way around the tables to one of the better lit corners where their freighter pilot sat quietly watching the show across the room, sipping one of his ales.</p>
<p>Dannan greeted Abcedi courteously, since he was a regular client of his and introduced Seven. The Norcadian analyzed her with his gaze but said nothing. Dannan ordered a round of drinks and proceed to remind the pilot of his previous offers to B'Elanna. </p>
<p>Abcedi asked, "So what will it be, transport for two?"</p>
<p>Dannan replied, "Yes, transport for two through your route, which should take them to the next two sectors."</p>
<p>"Alright, I want 100 credits up front," the pilot demanded. "They can be delivered to me later in the day, to hangerbay 17."</p>
<p>"Ah, is that really necessary?" Dannan questioned. "Seeing that we are acquaintances.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that's how I do business, Dannan. I can't have people cancel out on negotiations at the last minute," he answered, draining his cup. "Look, you'll find that every person's gonna demand the same thing, at a higher price. I'm already doing your friends a favor."</p>
<p>"We have not yet acquired the exact number of credits you are asking for," Seven interrupted. </p>
<p>Abcedi barked out a short laugh. "Then why are you here talking to me?"</p>
<p>"We will by the end of tonight, but we wish to make the arrangements now," justified Seven.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that won't work well with my crew. Listen, I would like to help, but I' ve turned down other offers based on your friend's deal with me. I can't wait any longer. I need to give my crew their salaries before we depart tomorrow," the pilot explained, sipping the last of his ale. </p>
<p>Seven ordered him an expensive brew to delay his departure. "Can you send a subspace message instead? That will not require you to decline other offers," she countered.</p>
<p>"Yes, I could. You can send over the specifications and credits before I leave tomorrow."</p>
<p>Seven nodded. It was better than nothing, and she didn't want to end the conversation empty-handed, having to explain herself later to B'Elanna. </p>
<p>"I'll be back in a week and a half or so. By that time, you may have all the credits, and I'll be happy to provide you two with transport," the Norcadian offered.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>"I am not getting into that costume!" B'Elanna asserted, as she and Edyn made their way through the streets to the Nokk tavern. B'Elanna held the hem of her hood over her nose to cover her face.</p>
<p>"Believe me, it will make a strong impression on the leader of the House of EnNokk. It's his tournament challenge that I've entered you in," Edyn persuaded, trying to keep up with the fiery woman who stalked off between the food stands.</p>
<p>"It will make an impression, alright, but the WRONG kind!" she snapped back.</p>
<p>For a moment, Edyn pictured the slim Klingon in the flimsy outfit he picked up for her, his eyes glinting. He ran to catch up with her. Several minutes later, they arrived at the Nokk tavern. Boisterous noises could be heard coming from the inside of the door. As Edyn greeted the Nokk that stood next to the entrance, B'Elanna got her first look at the species. The Nokk was imposing, about as tall as Seven, with shoulder length tawny hair. He, or was it she, looked mainly humanoid, with a flat forehead, deep-set gray eyes, tanned bronze skin, aquiline nose, thick lips, and a single canine protruding upwards at the right corner of his mouth. He looked well-muscled under his knee-length, sleeveless khaki tunic and trousers, and stood menacingly before them. Not all that bad looking in her opinion.</p>
<p>The ratty junk dealer walked up to the fella and asked for entry. The Nokk spared them a glance, B'Elanna in particular, and opened the door for them. Edyn led them inside, and B'Elanna was immediately overwhelmed by the smell of sweat and beer. The tavern was a deep structure, and all the tables and chairs had been shoved aside to make room for the number of warriors that were presenting themselves. Many were sparring or wrestling in the background, surrounded by cheering or jeering spectators. Edyn and B'Elanna weaved their way  through the crowd, majority of which were Nokks, their bodies large and even larger, who all seemed to have hair ranging from tawny to almost black hair, clean shaven faces, and fit physiques. The fighters were wearing jerseys and loose-fitting pants of various rich but dark colors in patterns of significance. The spectators were more elegantly dressed in suits and tunics of corresponding colors to their warriors. Edyn walked up to the group which was sitting on the sidelines, drinking beer and commenting on the various participants. Her "sponsor" approached the eldest of the bunch, a Nokk with slightly graying locks at his temples, that stood in contrast to his darker brown hair. He had incredibly deep-set black eyes that reflected intelligence, a rugged face with a strong, square jaw, and noble bearing.</p>
<p>"LenNokk," he addressed cordially, dipping his head slightly. "May I present to you my challenger?"</p>
<p>B'Elanna stepped up to the front, lowered her hood as rehearsed, and copied Edyn's gesture of goodwill. She stood still, chin lifted as she felt the group appraise her. LenNokk squinted at her, then raised his brow.</p>
<p>"Doesn't she talk?" he demanded, his voice rumbled in a deep baritone. The burly warriors next to him snickered.</p>
<p>"Of course, honored one," Edyn replied carefully.</p>
<p>The half-Klingon took her cue and spoke proudly, "I am Beylanna, daughter of Miral of the House of Prasba, from Qo'noS. I present myself with a challenge to the house of EnNokk. I would be honored to compete against any warrior of your choosing and will abide by the rules of your noble ritual."</p>
<p>Edyn was surprised at what the introduction revealed about the hot-blooded hottie, but he didn't show it on his face. He noted that the members of the House were impressed by the greeting. Though they were of different cultures, the formality with which Beylanna spoke with was very familiar.</p>
<p>"Welcome, House of Prasba. We have not met your kind before, but the respect with which you speak demonstrates us that you are deserving of this honor," answered LenNokk. "And what gift do you bring which we may received as a symbol of your respect for our Honored ritual?"</p>
<p>B'Elanna reached into her satchel, hung over her shoulder, and brought out the gleaming, jagged crystal of dilithium and a star chart. "I, Beylanna, come with a gift of 'Winter's Tears.' May its brilliance reflect that of the mighty House of EnNokk."</p>
<p>A red clad warrior left of LenNokk stepped forward to formally receive the gift, bowing in acknowledgement to the challenger.</p>
<p>"Your gift is worthy," accepted LenNokk, evaluating the shimmering rock.  "As for your opponent...the decision has yet to be made. You are allowed to familiarize yourself with the surroundings. Come back before me in one parsec, and you will demonstrate your skills briefly."  </p>
<p>"I will do as you ask," B'Elanna responded.</p>
<p>She and Edyn took their leave of the group, who turned their attention again to the fighting pairs in the middle of the room. B'Elanna let out a deep breath, glad she passed the initial introduction. Edyn lead her to the bar on the right side of the tavern, and ordered drinks for them. They rested against the counter as Edyn pointed out the different Nokk Houses present. A number of other species were participating including a few Hirogen, Norcadians, and a couple of buff members of Kal's species, to B'Elanna's revulsion. Actually, she wouldn't mind smacking a few of them around, still sore over what Seven had been put through in their hands. B'Elanna observed a few sparring sessions between Nokks. Gradually, she began to pick out the differences between the males and females. The females were exceptionally trim, and their muscles were well-defined. Their faces had a softer look to them, their eyes not quite so deep, with long lashes. They still had the same confident bearings and possessed admirable combat skills. Men and women were fighting each other on equal terms. B'Elanna saw someone approach her in the corner of her eye, but calmly sipped her beverage. She didn't want to jump the gun, especially since she was a guest in the tavern. Finally, the person next to her addressed her.</p>
<p>"You are the one who requested an audience with my family members." The voice was light and musical, and belonged to a Nokk female.</p>
<p>B'Elanna turned to answer the Nokk, and found herself looking into an exceptionally pretty face, with bright hazel eyes, dark brown hair, and a body with cinnamon-colored skin, much more tanned than even her own. She was dressed more formally than the sparring warriors, in a long purple gown with a scooped neck and cinched waist, that showed off her sleek arms.  The female looked back at her with interest.</p>
<p>"Um,...yes," B'Elanna replied tersely.  'Great start, you idiot,' the Klingon thought to herself.  </p>
<p>The Nokk tilted her head to the side, and regarded the Klingon with amusement. When LenNokk told her of the new participant, she expected someone more...robust. This alien look peculiarly petite to participate in her House's tournament. </p>
<p>"I am EnNokkia, niece to LenNokk the Great," she introduced herself.</p>
<p>"Beylanna, of the House of Prasba." </p>
<p>B'Elanna held her arm out, but EnNokkia looked at it perplexed. The lieutenant reached over and took her arm to perform the traditional grasp of friendship. She thought big gestures like these would impress the Nokk. EnNokkia seemed to get the idea and returned the squeeze. </p>
<p>"I wished to meet the female warrior who requested permission to challenge a member of my House," she explained.</p>
<p>"I guess I don't exactly meet your expectations," B'Elanna noted wryly.</p>
<p>EnNokkia did not expect humor to come from a warrior during the period of preparation. Perhaps, this female had the confidence to win the fight. It was notably refreshing. Usually she received boastful, arrogant responses from Nokks who had tried to put on airs in front of her.</p>
<p>"No, you do not," EnNokkia said with a smile that showed off her sharp, white canine.</p>
