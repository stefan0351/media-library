<p>"Captain, the away team, I mean, B'Elanna and Seven are requesting to beam up," informed Harry, unable to contain the joy and enthusiasm in his voice.</p>
<p>Captain Janeway smiled over her shoulder at the young Ensign, feeling the same giddiness in her heart as well.  "Permission granted. Chakotay, you have the bridge. I'm going down to greet them."</p>
<p>"Aye, Captain."</p>
<p>As she climbed the few steps to the upper tier of the bridge, she heard Paris call out and looked over to him.</p>
<p>"Ma'am, may Harry and I accompany you?" Paris asked with a slight yearning.</p>
<p>Nodding, the Captain assented. "Of course."</p>
<p>The two bridge officers proceeded to jog over to the turbo lift where Janeway waited impatiently. She was ready to jump out of her skin, knowing that her two missing officers were about to be transported back onto the ship. Days of worrying and wondering what happened to them were almost over, but a new sense of curiosity and concern invaded her thoughts. Now she wanted to hear the entire story of their ordeal, see their familiar faces, and spend a little time with them, especially Seven. No doubt, the young Borg must have been through a lot of difficult situations she had never been placed in before, and she wanted to guide the young woman through the consequences, if there were any.</p>
<p>When they finally reached Transporter Room 2, the doors couldn't open up faster for her. She instructed the crewman to beam the two women on board immediately in her most commanding voice. Hearing the tone, the poor man scrambled to comply with her wishes.</p>
<p>In less than a few seconds, B'Elanna and Seven materialized on the transporter pad. Slightly disoriented, the two women glanced around them for a moment and then at each other, oblivious, it seemed, to the friends that were standing there in the same room. </p>
<p>Janeway caught her breath as she took in the sight of the lieutenant and the ex-drone. B'Elanna appeared to be sporting a few healing bruises on her face, while Seven, in her untainted brown biosuit, appeared none the worse for wear. But Janeway found something in Seven's gaze toward the lieutenant that she had never seen before, some emotion she couldn't put her finger on because the Borg was trying to hide it. Never had she witnessed such a look on Seven's face, other than emotions such as anger, fear, confusion, and humor.  Both of them appeared as though they had been crying, their eyes slightly red and swollen, to the Captain's observant eyes.  Harry and Tom were more excited, however, and missed those details as they moved to intercept the two stepping down from the pad.</p>
<p>"Welcome back!" Harry cried from behind Tom.</p>
<p>B'Elanna saw Tom head straight for her, and though part of her welcomed him, the majority of her hesitated, wanting to turn and explain to Seven. But explain what? As if in slow motion, B'Elanna watched him walk towards her, arms outstretched to hug her and pull her close. She could see him bending down, his lips opened slightly, the tip of his pink tongue peeking.</p>
<p>'Oh, god! He's going to kiss me here, in front of the Captain. In front of Seven!'</p>
<p>The half-Klingon accepted the embrace, but turned her face away as his mouth descended toward hers. Luckily, Tom got the hint and gave her a full-bodied hug instead in welcome, thinking she was just reserved as usual in front of other people. He would save the real welcome for when they were alone. B'Elanna gently but firmly pushed him away, glancing carefully at Seven to see what her reaction was. Though the ex-drone's face remained impassive, her rounded eyes told the half-Klingon she had seen the entire exchange.</p>
<p>Janeway moved over to Seven's side and gave her a quick one-armed squeeze around the shoulders, and repeated the same gesture with the lieutenant.</p>
<p>"It's good to see you both. I trust you are alright?" the Captain asked with a small smile and crook of her brow.</p>
<p>"We are fully functional, Captain. But it would be best to proceed to Sickbay as both of us have sustained injuries," Seven replied.</p>
<p>B'Elanna turned around from receiving a friendly hug from Harry, upon hearing her words. "She's right, Captain. Seven's neural synapses were damaged by an EM pulse during our crash. The Doctor should examine her first."</p>
<p>"I'll come with you, B'Elanna," Tom interrupted, his eyes focused on his ex-lover with concern.</p>
<p>She was a bit disturbed by his attention, but since he was the Doctor's assistant, she thought he should be there to help EMH just in case Seven's treatment needed an extra pair of hands. </p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Seven felt her stomach roll when B'Elanna invited Ensign Paris to Sickbay with them. She didn't think there could be any substantial feelings left between them, but she started to have doubts.</p>
<p>"I'll take you down there myself," Janeway announced, as she began urging them out of the transporter room. "I want the full story of what happened, and an official report from each of you."</p>
<p>As they walked through the deck, both of the women looked about as if the surroundings were strange to them. Crewmembers that passed them by in the hallways greeted Seven and B'Elanna politely, gratified to see the two women had been retrieved successfully and were back among them.</p>
<p>Janeway smiled as she walked with Seven, her hand returned to rest against the ex-drone's back, unconsciously stroking up and down. Maybe Seven didn't really notice, her attention still dwelling on the interaction between B'Elanna and Tom Paris, as well as adjusting to being back on Voyager. However, B'Elanna did, as her eyes narrowed watching the Captain caress what was hers, and the lieutenant was about to go Klingon. But years of restraining herself paid off, and B'Elanna remained silent, feeling only a deep sadness envelope her. It seemed to the lieutenant that the Captain had feelings for Seven, strong ones, by the way her unconscious actions had betrayed her.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Seven watched as the EMH waved the tricorder over her ocular implant while she sat patiently on the biobed. It had been a pleasant reunion, which of course included a bit of witty banter between them, and a bit of sarcasm toward the lieutenant. B'Elanna just ignored the barb and rolled her eyes, being quite accustomed to the Doctor's bedside manner, something about "leave it to the Klingon to find a way to get paid for violence." Nevertheless, he seemed genuinely glad to see her as well, having shown her equal attention. They had given a brief history as to how they obtained their injuries, but otherwise, the rest of their adventure remained unrevealed.</p>
<p>"Well, Seven," the Doctor began, as he completed his scan, "it looks like some of your Borg neuromuscular junctions were damaged, and you have a few neurotransmitter imbalances. But otherwise, the one regeneration cycle you underwent on the planet saved your Borg systems from further injury. I should be able to repair most of the systems now, the rest with a couple of long regeneration cycles."</p>
<p>"That's good news, Doctor," Janeway responded as she stood next to Seven, one hand leaning on the edge of the biobed.</p>
<p>Seven peered over to the next biobed where B'Elanna laid listening to the EMH's pronouncement, a look of relief touching her bronze features. Seven arched her brow, realizing B'Elanna had saved her again, and for a moment, B'Elanna shared her gaze.</p>
<p>After making the final passes over B'Elanna's bruises with the dermal regenerator, Tom brought over the medical cart for the EMH. Solicitously, he returned to B'Elanna's side to Seven's irritation.</p>
<p>"This compound should balance out your neurotransmitters," the Doctor indicated as he inserted the solution into the hypospray, and injected Seven with it. "You should stay here until I've worked out the final procedure to repair most of your major neural synapses. The lieutenant can be discharged to her quarters. And I recommend that you both take today and tomorrow off before you return to active duty."</p>
<p>Since there was really nothing left to allow her to stay, reluctantly, B'Elanna proceeded to climb off the biobed and leave for her quarters. Seven suppressed the sudden, near panic she felt as she watched the lieutenant's retreating back, reminding herself she was among friends and acquaintances.</p>
<p>"Good work, B'Elanna," the Captain praised, while the half-Klingon turned to acknowledge her words. "I appreciate what you did for Seven."</p>
<p>B'Elanna looked at the Borg, and replied sincerely, "Anytime."</p>
<p>"Lieutenant," Seven called out, wanting to stall her departure. "I will retrieve my belongings from you at a later date."</p>
<p>B'Elanna wasn't stupid to miss the rope thrown at her, so to speak, and grabbed for it. "Sure, Seven. Stop by later today, if you'd like.</p>
<p>Satisfied, the Borg nodded in response, and the lieutenant turned once again to leave, with Ensign Paris in tow apparently. </p>
<p>"Now, Seven, lie down and try to relax while I set up the equipment I need," the Doctor instructed as he moved off to his medical consoles.</p>
<p>Janeway came closer and patted her shoulder lightly. "Get some rest, Seven. Regenerate. Maybe we can meet for breakfast tomorrow, and you can tell me about the past several days."</p>
<p>"Yes, Captain," Seven replied obediently.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>"Hey, B'Elanna! Wait up..." Tom yelled out as he sped up to catch her before she got into the turbo lift. "Let me walk you back to your quarters."</p>
<p>"Alright," B'Elanna answered carefully, as she slowed down to allow her former boyfriend to escort her.</p>
<p>When they arrived at her doors, Tom invited himself in to her chagrin. She was really tired, mainly still upset from having to leave the planet, and she wasn't ready to deal with Tom and their relationship.</p>
<p>"How about I run a nice, warm bath for you?" Tom asked.</p>
<p>It sounded wonderful, but B'Elanna didn't want Tom to stay in her quarters while she naked only a few feet away. He might read too much into their usual comfort level which included being naked in front of one another up until several weeks ago.</p>
<p>"Thanks, but no thanks. I think I'll unpack, rest a bit, and get used to everything first," B'Elanna politely refused.</p>
<p>"How about I replicate us some food? You must be hungry," Tom offered eagerly, shuffling over to the replicator.</p>
<p>"No, really, Tom. That's okay. I just want to re-familiarize myself with my quarters and Voyager." B'Elanna took him by the arm, nudging him towards the doors unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>"Geez, B'Elanna, you make it sound like you were gone forever. You were only missing for ten days or so," Tom pointed out. "You and Harry were gone for much longer on that poet's planet."</p>
<p>"It seemed like more than ten days...," B'Elanna trailed off.</p>
<p>"Come to think of it, maybe the next time you're out on an away mission, count me in," Tom teased. "At least that way, I can look after you."</p>
<p>"I can look out for myself, Tom," B'Elanna replied, her tone slightly dangerous. "Now go, so I can freshen up and relax."</p>
<p>"I guess you are tired," Tom conceded. "I'll let you rest then. Let me know if you feel like grabbing dinner together in the Mess Hall tonight," he asked as he backtracked towards the door.</p>
<p>"Okay," B'Elanna replied noncommittally, watching him disappear through the doors. </p>
<p>After a passing thought, B'Elanna decided to key in changes to her door code. At last, she was alone in her own room, one among many on Deck 9, on an Intrepid class starship making its way back to the Alpha Quadrant. She pulled off her jacket, tossed it onto the couch and headed towards her bed. Kicking off her boots, she'd lay there now and wait for Seven to come by.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Seven anxiously stepped off the turbo lift. The Doctor had discharged her from Sickbay with strict orders to regenerate for twelve hours continuously through for the next two nights, in order for her nanoprobes to finish completing the repairs to her damaged systems. Those were orders she could not follow, however, until she saw B'Elanna, whose quarters she was making her way towards. </p>
<p>Strangely, she continued to feel nervous but for reasons she could not explain. There were so many thoughts running through her mind, mainly discovering how difficult it had been to curb her feelings toward B'Elanna in front of their crewmates. Seven did not understand why she and B'Elanna had automatically hid the change in their relationship, when it would only make things difficult for the both of them. She wanted to speak to the half-Klingon so that they could figure out a way to show the crew how their feelings had grown for one another since their departure on the away mission. She wanted them to be able to express themselves freely.</p>
<p>The turbo lift doors opened, and Mezoti walked in. Finding Seven, the little girl gasped and immediately hugged the older woman.</p>
<p>"Seven!" Mezoti cried, "They said you had returned. And you are functioning normally in all parameters?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Mezoti," Seven answered, her brow arched in amusement.</p>
<p>Noticing what she had done, the Borg child, dropped her arms and clasped them behind her back, once again resuming her customary drone demeanor.</p>
<p>"Please excuse my outburst, Seven of Nine," Mezoti apologized, as she took as step back.</p>
<p>"It is alright, Mezoti. I am happy to see you as well," Seven reassured, and took in the sight of the small girl smiling, answering it wholeheartedly to Mezoti's amazement.  </p>
<p>"All the others are waiting in Cargo Bay 2 for your return, but I was too impatient and decided to come look for you. Is that where you were heading?"</p>
<p>"No, actually, I was going to Lt. Torres' quarters to retrieve my belongings. However, I will accompany you to our Cargo Bay instead."  Seeing B'Elanna would have to wait, as she had almost neglected her responsibilities, and she wanted to make sure the children had been well-cared for in her absence.</p>
<p>When they arrived at Cargo Bay 2, Seven discovered Mezoti was indeed accurate in saying that the other Borg children had been waiting there for her. She found Icheb working diligently at the console and the twins busying themselves with organizing the equipment obtained over the past few months. When she walked in, all of them halted what they were doing and came to greet her with much exuberance despite themselves.</p>
<p>"Seven, you are back!" Rebi exclaimed, as he ran over to her.</p>
<p>"We have been so worried," Azan explained, as he walked to her other side.</p>
<p>"We have been trying to assist in locating your whereabouts," Icheb chimed in. "I trust the Doctor has repaired the damage you sustained during your mission."</p>
<p>Seven's eyebrows raised suspiciously. "And how did you know I had been injured?"</p>
<p>"Ensign Kim relayed the information at our request. We wished to know all information regarding the search and news of your well-being," he explained. "And Lt. Torres is well, I hope?"</p>
<p>"Yes, the Doctor allowed her to return to her quarters."</p>
<p>"We were concerned at first, that you and the Lieutenant had been lost on the away mission together. We have observed your previous hostilities," Mezoti added.</p>
<p>"Lt. Torres and I were never hostile," Seven responded primly, fixing a stern gaze at the young Borgs.</p>
<p>"A poor choice of words," Icheb apologized, giving Mezoti a glare. Turning back to Seven, he said, "But after accessing Lt. Torres' Star Fleet away mission leadership records, we were summarily satisfied to conclude that she would be a favorable crewmate under such circumstances, despite your relationship. Her level of intelligence and experience were appropriate."</p>
<p>"The Lieutenant and I have resolved our differences." Seven could not help the slight smile that arose on her face with those words. Then frowning, she noted, "You do not have clearance to access such records, Icheb."</p>
<p>"We were careful not to-," Azan started, looking up at Seven.</p>
<p>"-be discovered in the act. We even use Borg encryption to mask our trail," Rebi finished.</p>
<p>"No one knows what we did, not even Tuvok," Mezoti continued.</p>
<p>"That is not the issue," Seven chided gently. "You do not have authorization, and therefore, what you did was wrong. You will refrain from accessing any of the crews' performance records from now on."</p>
<p>"Yes, Seven," Azan replied quickly.</p>
<p>"When we accessed Lt. Torres' records, we noticed that someone else had done so before, one day prior to your away mission. They left a Borg signature, one that we could recognize since it was exactly what we did. The only other person who would have known how to do it would be you, Seven," Mezoti pointed out.</p>
<p>Embarrassed, Seven inhaled deeply. "I was wrong to violate Star Fleet protocol as well. I needed information which would assist me during the mission, but I realize now I should not have done so."</p>
<p>"We're sorry," Icheb said sincerely. "We were only concerned for your safety, and wanted to know if Lt. Torres would be able to handle the situation, not that we doubted your own capabilities. We're glad that you and the lieutenant have resolve your differences. She will be a most efficient...friend."</p>
<p>The Borg children all nodded in congruence.</p>
<p>"I'm glad you approve," Seven noted with humor.</p>
<p>"I wanted to ask Lt. Torres to sponsor my high resolution gravimetric sensor array project after the science fair," Icheb elaborated, "since she was Chief of Engineering. I was hesitant, however. But now that your relationship has improved, I feel less awkward in approaching her."</p>
<p>"Icheb finds her aesthetically pleasing," Rebi teased.</p>
<p>"I do not!" he cried indignantly, looking at Seven and shaking his head in denial.</p>
<p>"Do too!" Azan added, grinning.</p>
<p>Seven quirked her brow high at the comment. "Indeed. Well, I am inclined to agree." She was openly smiling now to the children's surprise.</p>
<p>Mezoti observed, "I believe the Lieutenant will be part of our collective soon..."</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>"Computer, locate Seven of Nine."</p>
<p>"Seven of Nine is in Cargo Bay 2," the computer responded.</p>
<p>B'Elanna had laid there on her bed for a long time waiting for Seven, and it appeared that the ex-drone was not coming any time soon. The Doctor probably ordered Seven to regenerate to speed her recovery, and was going to be in her alcove for the rest of the day. B'Elanna turned over and pulled the sack with their belongings from the planet over next to her. She rummaged through the pack, found the holo imager, and clicked through all the photos that were stored in the memory. </p>
<p>There was group shot of them all together, with Dannan, Seven and Edyn in the rear, her and Moka in the front, taken from Fessi's back where Edyn had set the timer. Then there was a photo of Seven holding her from behind, both of them laughing. B'Elanna smiled as she remembered her friends and the moments captured. Another photo caught her eye, never having noticed it before until now. It was an image of Seven and her kissing in the backyard apparently, and the half-Klingon guessed that Edyn had snuck the image in while they had been preoccupied. B'Elanna downloaded the photos into her laptop. Suddenly, she had an inspiration to go to the Holodeck.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>"Computer, locate Lt. Torres."</p>
<p>"Lt. Torres is in Holodeck 1."</p>
<p>Seven had left the Borg children to find B'Elanna, but the lieutenant had not been in her quarters, and the ex-drone wanted so much to see her. She missed having B'Elanna at her side, and it was more difficult than she had anticipated once aboard Voyager. Seven arrived at the Holodeck and accessed the doors, not caring if B'Elanna would mind, out of urgency. When she entered, it was empty. Shaking her arms in frustration, she decided to hail the lieutenant instead.</p>
<p>-Chirp-  "Seven of Nine to Lt. Torres."</p>
<p>"Torres here." </p>
<p>B'Elanna's voice, though surprised, came through over the comm, and Seven felt her heart rate increase because of it. </p>
<p>"Where is your location?"</p>
<p>"I was on my way to the Mess Hall."</p>
<p>"I..I would like to pick up my belongings, if that would not be inconvenient for you?" Seven asked, her insides fluttering with impatience.</p>
<p>"Sure, Seven. I'll meet you at my quarters?" B'Elanna replied.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am proceeding there now."</p>
<p>Seven pace seemed hurried through the halls even to those whom she passed by casually, until finally, she found herself once again outside B'Elanna's quarters. She rang the chime, and the doors swished open. </p>
<p>B'Elanna rose from the couch when she saw the lithe figure walk through her doorway. It had been agonizing to wait for the Borg all day. Quickly, she took the tall woman into her arms, finding the tension in her body released incidentally as she snuggled deeper in the embrace, and felt Seven sigh.</p>
<p>"I have desired to do this since morning," Seven murmured, her cheek resting against B'Elanna's forehead, and her arms wound around the young Klingon tightly.</p>
<p>"Me too...," B'Elanna whispered, pulling Seven's face down and kissing her.</p>
<p>"May I stay with you tonight?" Seven asked between each taste of B'Elanna's lips.</p>
<p>"Didn't the Doctor say you have to regenerate for the next couple of nights?" the half-Klingon recalled plaintively.</p>
<p>"Yes, but I can delay my regeneration cycles," Seven protested.</p>
<p>B'Elanna pursed her lips in thought. "No..., not at your expense," she replied, shaking her head slightly. "You need it. Besides, you'll be regenerating in a matter of seconds once you climb into that alcove of yours. I'm the one who has to suffer being alone in bed, without you."</p>
<p>"The idea of our continued separation is unappealing, B'Elanna," Seven responded, molding her body into the half-Klingon's with pleasant pressure.</p>
<p>"I know, but it will only be for the next two nights. I'll walk you back to your Cargo Bay and tuck you in, okay?"</p>
<p>"Can't we remain here for a little while longer?" Seven complained, which was a close to begging as she could get, B'Elanna noticed while chuckling.</p>
<p>"The sooner you regenerate, the sooner we can spend the day together tomorrow," B'Elanna reasoned, nibbling playfully on a nearby earlobe, clearly not making it any easier for the young Borg.</p>
<p>"You are correct. I will comply," Seven answered, grabbing a handful of ripe buttocks. Two could play that game.</p>
<p>"Oh god, we're going to your alcove right now," B'Elanna yelped, dragging the ex-drone with her out the door by the arm.</p>
<p>Once outside, however, B'Elanna all together dropped her hand, too aware of the fact that they were going to encounter a number of curious eyes. Seven sobered immediately, wondering if this was how their relationship was going to be, but she held her tongue, not wanting to bring the discussion up until they reached a more private setting, which was unlikely to happen in the Cargo Bay as well.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>"Computer, what time is it?" </p>
<p>B'Elanna flipped over again under the covers, trying to find a comfortable position. It was the fourth time she had awoken since turning in early. She had gone over some of the day to day reports, updating herself on the jobs done in Engineering during her absence, but for the most part, she had remained distracted. </p>
<p>"The time is 0536 hours," the computer announced.</p>
<p>In a little less than half an hour, she would see Seven again, and her skin tingled with the thought. It had been hard to leave Seven in the Cargo Bay once she had walked the Borg there. The children were still in the middle of their daily activities since Seven was starting her cycle earlier, and they took a particular interest in the two women. B'Elanna felt their eyes on her during the entire time she programmed Seven's regeneration cycle and helped the ex-drone into her alcove. She wondered what that was all about.</p>
<p>"Computer, what is the time now?"</p>
<p>"The time is 0541 hours."</p>
<p>"Ahhhhhh!" she cried out in frustration, tossing her pillow up in the air only to have it fall onto her face.</p>
<p>B'Elanna got up from the bed and shuffled over to the bathroom, her restlessness radiating energy. A sonic shower and a bit of grooming should take up the rest of the time, she thought. As the buzzing vapors swept over her body, she let her mind wander. Part of her remembered living a different life not too long ago, but somehow her brain had managed to separate that existence. Data padds, turbo lifts, holodecks, sonic showers, the deck plating that had the dip in it, the door that was stuck longer than the rest in Engineering, everything she had been used to was back again. Everything was the same except for her relationship with Seven. B'Elanna knew she had been keeping her distance, and she had seen the brief expressions of confusion on Seven's face. Half of her wanted to forget all else and declare her love for the young Borg in front of everyone on the ship, but the other half wanted to slow down, take a breather, and adjust to the changes. She knew why part of her needed to hold back.</p>
<p>Feeling the sonic pulses weaken, she hopped out of her shower just as it had ended, wrapping a fluffy peach towel around her body. Her body clean and her hair still slightly damp, B'Elanna polished herself in the mirror, trying to occupy as much of the time left as possible. With one last sweep through her hair and  a satisfied look in the mirror, the half-Klingon donned a fresh new uniform. Actually, she removed her uniform, putting it aside, and dressed herself in civvies instead, a long-sleeved, black T-shirt and brown pants. It was her day off after all.</p>
<p>"Computer, what's the time?"</p>
<p>"The time is 0606 hours."</p>
<p>"Locate Seven of Nine."</p>
<p>"Seven of Nine is in the Mess Hall."  </p>
<p>That puzzled the lieutenant. When she left Seven last night, they hadn't made any plans to meet there this morning.</p>
<p>"Computer, who's in the Mess Hall at this moment?" B'Elanna asked, her mind working on overload.</p>
<p>It took a moment for the computer to answer. "Ensign Ashmore, Lt. Ayala, Crewman Jenny Delaney, Crewman Fitzpatrick--,"</p>
<p>"Computer, stop," B'Elanna ordered with annoyance. She had been looking forward to seeing the Borg as promised first thing today. "Is Captain Janeway in the Mess Hall?"</p>
<p>"Affirmative."</p>
<p>There. She had her answer, and that was the crux of the problem.</p>

<p>Draining her glass of milk, Seven replaced the cup on the table she shared with Kathryn Janeway. When she had awoken from her regeneration cycle this morning, she opened her eyes to the sight of the older woman. The smile on the Captain's face that greeted her gave her a sense of warmth and homecoming, relieving some of the initial anxiety she felt since returning to the ship yesterday.</p>
<p>"How's your breakfast?" the Captain inquired politely, as she looked across the table at Seven, who was wearing the blue biosuit which Kathryn favored, liking the way it accentuated the young woman's eyes.</p>
<p>Janeway was already enjoying her second cup of java since they sat down, which was accompanied by a Southwestern omelet and toast.</p>
<p>"It is...delicious," Seven replied, adapting some common adjectives she used with Moka's...cooking, peering down at her simple plate of scrambled eggs and hotcakes. She sighed at having thought of the Rangoon woman, briefly remembering the way those weathered hands deftly kneaded dough, tossed spices into boiling pots, and comforted her so easily.</p>
<p>"So,.... Are you going to tell me what happened to you and B'Elanna on the planet, or are you going to keep me in the dark?" Janeway asked, her expression faintly amused.</p>
<p>"I intend to make a full report, Captain," Seven replied, not understanding the conversation.</p>
<p>"I know you will. But I'd also like to hear it from you, how it impacted you," Janeway explained, taking another sip from her cup of coffee. "This isn't an official inquiry, Seven. I just thought it'd be nice to catch up with each other over breakfast."</p>
<p>Seven had intended to enjoy a short meal with the Captain, and then excuse herself to find B'Elanna. She had been looking forward to spending the day with the half-Klingon, but now she realized that her friends also wanted some share of her time. It was another one of those human rituals that she was unfamiliar with, her own selfish needs to be set aside.  Perhaps, she could discuss with the Captain what had occurred between her and Lt. Torres, and have a few of her questions answered. </p>
<p>Just then, the doors to the Mess Hall opened, and in walked Lt. Torres. A few crewmembers that weren't focused on their breakfast noticed how well the half-Klingon filled out her casual clothes. B'Elanna spied Seven and the Captain out of the dining crowd, sitting at their own table in the far corner of the room overlooking the port windows. They were chatting amicably, secluded in their private conversation. Though annoyed, the engineer walked over to the counter as nonchalantly as she could manage, finding a few things she actually thought were palatable.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant."</p>
<p>B'Elanna turned, wondering who was possibly addressing her, to find Vorik standing near her, his breakfast plate already filled. He waited patiently for her to answer.</p>
<p>"Vorik," she acknowledged in surprise.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said simply. "I took the liberty of finding a table, if you would like to join me?"</p>
<p>It took a moment for her to answer, her expression bewildered, because it wasn't the first time he had reserved seats for them. Four years ago, he had tried to court her with similar actions, prior to his Pon Farr. Thank Kahless that wouldn't happen for another three years.</p>
<p>"Of course...," the lieutenant answered evenly, picking up a plate, and headed towards the dining table the ensign pointed out.</p>
<p>In truth, she wanted the distraction. B'Elanna didn't know why she came here, other than the fact that she could watch the Captain and Seven eat together, which wasn't all that appealing to her come to think of it. </p>
<p>Seven, in the meantime, had lost her train of thought when she saw the lieutenant enter without attempting to come over and greet them. The ex-drone didn't even bother to ask Janeway any of the questions on her mind, witnessing Vorik approach B'Elanna and evidently, her joining him. </p>
<p>"Seven,...  Earth to Seven?"  Janeway realized she might as well have been speaking gibberish.</p>
<p>Janeway followed Seven's consternated gaze which was directed evidently at Lt. Torres. Now the Captain was really curious as to what happened between the two women. When they returned yesterday, it had appeared to her that they had reconciled their antagonism. Perhaps she assumed incorrectly.</p>
<p>"Is there something wrong with the Lieutenant?" Janeway asked, back in her officer mode.</p>
<p>Startled from her focus, Seven reverted her eyes back to the Captain. "No. I...I did not expect Lt. Torres to be up so early on her day off," Seven tried to cover unconvincingly.</p>
<p>"If you prefer to be doing something else, Seven, feel free to excuse yourself," Janeway told her.</p>
<p>"Of course not, Captain. I enjoy the time we spend together," Seven responded earnestly, not wanting to injure the older woman's feelings. "And I would like to continue our conversation."  She would have to meet up with B'Elanna later.</p>
<p>Janeway's face lit up with a surprisingly coy smile at the compliment, and reached out to pat the young Borg's hand casually in thanks. The expression seemed to lift years off of the Captain's face, which always seemed to be weighted down by the burden of command. Seven couldn't help but smile back.</p>
<p>The ex-drone then began the painstaking process of revealing to the Captain what happened to her and the half-Klingon, starting with the shuttle being attacked by an unknown vessel after locating a deposit of dilithium, and the harrowing chase through the asteroid belt relying only on the engineer's piloting skills. Janeway chuckled at Seven's description, obviously entertained by Seven's unexpected skill at storytelling. She was horrified when she learned how they had crashed, and the extent to which Seven had been injured. She was visibly impressed by B'Elanna's heroics for carrying the damaged Borg through the desert, and noticeably touched when Seven revealed the Lieutenant's initial attempts to comfort Seven in such dire circumstances. But Janeway's expression became one of rage as the story progressed to the encounter with Kal and his gang of lowlifes. It took a great deal of reassurance by the ex-drone to pacify the woman that sat across from her.</p>
<p>"He touched you...inappropriately." Kathryn practically choked out the words, clutching her coffee cup.</p>
<p>"Not to the extent he could have, Captain," Seven explained. "B'Elanna made sure of that. And he was duly punished..."</p>
<p>Seven continued her story, describing the house where they had received refuge and the wonderful people who had provided it. She described Moka, Dannan, Edyn and even Fessi with clear detail, and obvious affection in her voice. She talked about her experience with being half-paralyzed, her feelings of pain, vulnerability, and fear, as well as her joy when B'Elanna had found the Borg escape cube, essentially her cure. Seven spoke of each event that impacted her with so much passion, honest reflection, and exuberance that Kathryn was genuinely moved. Though Seven never touched upon the intimate moments between her and B'Elanna, nevertheless, the Captain was impressed by how the two women had stuck by each other through the good and the bad, and sensed that this had been a life-changing experience for both.</p>
<p>Finally, they realized that the breakfast crowd had been replaced by the lunch crowd, and the Captain had to return to the bridge. Neelix inadvertently cued them when he came by, wondering if they would like to order another meal, but both declined. Seven scanned the room, disappointed but not shocked to find B'Elanna had already left.</p>
<p>"Well, Seven, I've really enjoyed our conversation, and I'm so glad you told me what happened. I think the experiences and what you've learned from them will be with you for the rest of your life. I suspect there's more, but maybe we can resume where you left off in a more private setting. Today, I just wanted you to be around your crewmembers, since many of them have missed your presence." Janeway offered, "Perhaps, we can talk again, like over dinner tomorrow night?"</p>
<p>"That would be acceptable, Captain. May I confirm the time when I have arranged my work schedule?"</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Chakotay made his way up on the lift in Engineering. As first officer on Voyager, he only occasionally made it down to Deck 11 even though his good friend had headed the department, his skills more known for diplomacy than warp mechanics.  On this day, however, it was that very good friend he was searching for, and he found her on the top tier, working furiously at the console, despite being out of uniform.</p>
<p>"I thought the Doctor gave you today off too," he said as he snuck up behind her, the only person who could without consequences.</p>
<p>B'Elanna spun around at the sound of his voice, pleasantly startled to see him, yet at the same time wary as she turned her attention back to the console.</p>
<p>"Shouldn't you be on the bridge?" she asked, knowing the Captain was still away from command at the moment.</p>
<p>"I thought you might care to join me for lunch. And you should be resting, not working," he pointed out.</p>
<p>"I'm just taking a look ahead for tomorrow. No harm in that," she jested. </p>
<p>"No, I guess not, but you still have to follow the Doctor's orders. Besides, the Captain's on the bridge now. I'm sure she has everything under control," he drawled.</p>
<p>B'Elanna paused her tapping, a fleeting ripple in her cheek at the mention of the Captain, then resumed her data download. Chakotay knew her long enough to know something was up. The half-Klingon looked tense like she was coiled tightly, ready to spring into action.</p>
<p>Quietly, he took her firmly by the elbow, and mumbled in her ear, "Let's go somewhere and talk, privately."</p>
<p>B'Elanna had two options, either her clock him right then and there so he would release her, or cooperate and avoid being thrown in the brig. He was only trying to be a friend, so she settled for being led away. They walked silently through the corridors until they reached her quarters. When they entered her relatively simple, Spartan living area, he sat her down on the couch.</p>
<p>"So, are you going to tell me what's going on?" Chakotay began.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure what you mean," B'Elanna evaded, folding her arms.</p>
<p>"Well, you looked like you were about to explode back in Engineering. You're angry about something. Since you just returned from an away mission gone wrong, I'll have to assume that it's because of something that happened during that time," he reasoned, staring at her with great intensity.</p>
<p>B'Elanna scoffed, and turned from his gaze. Her face tightened, frustrated that he could always read her so well to a certain extent. His friendship had always been one that she could depend on, and no one else could command the loyalty from her like him, not even Janeway. They had risked their lives for each other on too many occasions not to have formed such a connection.</p>
<p>"So what is it?" he entreated in that soft, steady voice of his.</p>
<p>"I'm...I'm in love with Seven." There, she said it candidly, with no apology.</p>
<p>"Oh,...I see." </p>
<p>Chakotay was stunned, to say the least, the lines on his forehead creasing the dark tattoo of his tribe. It was completely unexpected. He knew B'Elanna would never say such things lightly, nor feel such emotions for another person frivolously. Having come right out and said it meant that the half-Klingon had it bad. Real bad.</p>
<p>Sighing, B'Elanna continued, "And I believe she has feelings for me too." Her voice, however, sounded miserable.</p>
<p>"Then, what's the problem?"</p>
<p>"The problem," B'Elanna raged, getting up from her seat and stomping away a few steps, "is the Captain. She's interested in Seven."</p>
<p>Remembering who she was talking to, B'Elanna clamped her mouth shut. Chakotay looked down for a moment, seemingly in deep thought. When he looked up, he had a wry expression on his face, as if he was almost mocking himself.</p>
<p>"Does it really matter, B'Elanna? You just told me that Seven returns your feelings."</p>
<p>"Of course it does!" B'Elanna sputtered, watching Chakotay frown, not understanding this time.</p>
<p>She tried again. "You know as well as I do that Janeway and Seven have a special bond between them. You've seen them together, how they've interacted in the past. The Captain's being far more obvious now about how she feels. Seven's never had a romantic relationship before, and it's only been a few days since we admitted that we cared about each other. She doesn't realize that things can change between two people, but I do. This is it for me, Chakotay. I love her and there's no turning back. What if she discovers that she'd rather be with Janeway?"</p>
<p>"Seven isn't one to take a relationship lightly either, B'Elanna. She's tried before, and it's taken her this long to determine who she wants to be with. She's an intelligent woman, and she's made an intelligent decision. She knows what the consequences are," Chakotay argued passionately, trying to console his friend. "You're just scared that she might not love you as much as you love her."</p>
<p>"No, that's not it," B'Elanna vehemently denied, waving a finger at him.</p>
<p>"No? Then, think about this. Love may not be rational, B'Elanna. But it doesn't just come on a whim, and it doesn't just go away either. You have to work at it. Take it from me, sometimes, a few days is all that's necessary between two people." He had gotten up and approached her, his gestures all pointing to his own heart.</p>
<p>Just then, the door chimed, catching them off guard.</p>
<p>"Come," B'Elanna invited after a bit of hesitation.</p>
<p>It was Seven, and the Borg got the distinct impression that she had interrupted something. She saw Commander Chakotay and B'Elanna exchange glances, then he excused himself politely and left. Seven watched as B'Elanna walked over towards the recliner, sitting down heavily.</p>
<p>"Hey," the lieutenant greeted, forcing herself to be cheerful, "are you a sight for sore eyes."</p>
<p>"Perhaps, the Doctor should take a look at them for you?" Seven asked as she trailed after the half-Klingon.</p>
<p>"It's just an expression," B'Elanna told her affectionately.</p>
<p>"I know. I was attempting to make a joke," Seven explained, arching her brow.</p>
<p>" Ah..." B'Elanna rubbed her eyes, already feeling very exhausted by the day.</p>
<p>Concerned, Seven knelt down in front of the woman. B'Elanna looked at her with a sad expression, and Seven felt an instant pang of pain in her chest. She pulled the woman to her by the arms, and hugged her fiercely.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, B'Elanna?" she implored, running her hands up and down the lieutenant's back in a comforting motion.</p>
<p>"Nothing. I just missed you, that's all," B'Elanna dismissed, as she moved Seven onto the couch next to her.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I could not join you earlier. I found the Captain waiting for me when my regeneration cycle ended, and she wished to speak to me. I did not realize it would take so long."</p>
<p>"It's okay. I guess we have to expect that we'll both be busy for the next few days until things get settled."</p>
<p>"We still have four hours and twenty minutes before I need to regenerate. And as I said before, I could always delay it," Seven proposed.</p>
<p>"Stand up and let me look at you," B'Elanna instructed.</p>
<p>Curious, Seven obeyed and stood, allowing B'Elanna to inspect her. B'Elanna took her by the hand and led her around the room, noticing how fluid the Borg's motions were once again. Obviously, the Doctor was successful in repairing Seven's neural synapses. </p>
<p>"Your motor function...it's normal again," B'Elanna noted, beaming from ear to ear.</p>
<p>B'Elanna's apparent concern for her well-being warmed the young Borg. "The Doctor says my systems are approximately ninety-two percent repaired, and he doesn't foresee any complications."</p>
<p>"Ninety-two percent, huh? I guess we can't go to the Holodeck for a game of Hoverball just yet," the half-Klingon teased. Her brow furrowed as she tried to think of something for them to do in the time remaining.</p>
<p>"What do you usually do when you are off-duty, B'Elanna?" Seven asked, linking her arms around the lieutenant's shoulders.</p>
<p>"Well, other than using the Holodeck, I work on Engineering proposals, maybe play a game of Derata, watch a little television with Tom--," she mentioned before she could stop herself.</p>
<p>Seven's arched her brow, but allowed B'Elanna to continue.</p>
<p>"Sometimes I read a Klingon novel, but usually I'm in Engineering, " B'Elanna finally admitted, to which Seven smirked. "What about you?"</p>
<p>"When I am not playing velocity or sculpting with the Captain, I report to the Holodeck to work on my social lessons with the Doctor. Other times, he and I practice singing. However, for the majority of my recreational time, I spend it on more constructive tasks in Astrometrics or monitoring the children's activities."</p>
<p>B'Elanna snickered, leaning into Seven. "Kahless, what are we going to do with two workaholics..."</p>
<p>"It does present a bit of a problem," the ex-drone conceded.</p>
<p>"Hey, I have something to show you." </p>
<p>B'Elanna pulled away, but beckoned Seven to follow her to her desk where her computer console laid. Offering Seven the seat, she leaned down over her desk and activated her files, bringing up the holo images they had taken while on the planet. Seven reached out unconsciously to touch the screen, as if she could somehow reconnect with the loved ones they left behind.</p>
<p>"I miss them," Seven said softly, balling her outstretched hand into a fist as she withdrew it.</p>
<p>"I do too. My appetite hasn't been the same since. I thought I had to let out all my uniforms," B'Elanna joked, albeit half-hearted.</p>
<p>Seven cupped B'Elanna's cheek tenderly, the comely face so close to her own. Something in B'Elanna's eyes told her the lieutenant wasn't happy. Whether it was from leaving the planet or for some other reason, Seven vowed to find out, no matter how difficult. And more importantly, Seven wanted to discuss their relationship, hoping at last she could reveal to B'Elanna all she felt for the half-Klingon. Love. A concept that she never thought for one minute, during the first years she had been severed from the collective, she would grasp.</p>
<p>They spent some of the time chatting about the friends they missed, reminiscing over the objects they had brought back with them, and talking about other idle matters as they relaxed on the couch. This was what B'Elanna missed, the solitude of being in each other's company. B'Elanna held Seven in her strong arms, not wanting ever to let go. </p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>"Are you hungry? Perhaps, we can have dinner in the Mess Hall before I return to the Cargo Bay to regenerate," Seven suggested, getting up from her seat.</p>
<p>"Hmm.... I don't think I'm in the mood for one of Neelix's concoctions," B'Elanna replied, still slouching against the cushions.</p>
<p>B'Elanna's answer didn't surprise the ex-drone, but Seven was losing patience with the situation. She wondered why B'Elanna was so afraid of being out in public with her. B'Elanna was never one to shy away from being truthful. What did it matter if their romantic relationship became apparent to the rest of the crew. Seven didn't want to hide the change. It was not as if they were intentionally flaunting the relationship. The lieutenant's reticence only caused her to speculate the worst.</p>
<p>"We could replicate our meal. I thought it would be nice to invite Ensign Kim to join us as well."</p>
<p>B'Elanna shifted uncomfortably. "I'd rather just stay in, and have dinner here," she answered, not really looking at the other woman.</p>
<p>"Why do you wish to hide our romantic affiliation from the rest of the crew?" Seven asked bluntly, her posture distinctly Borg.</p>
<p>"What?!" B'Elanna balked, sitting straight up in her seat.</p>
<p>"Why do you wish to hide the change in our relationship?" she repeated. "Are you ashamed to be associated with a Borg, with me in such a manner?"</p>
<p>"Where the hell did you get that idea?" B'Elanna demanded, now standing in front of Seven, her exasperation overshadowing her concern.</p>
<p>"From the way you isolate us from the rest of the crew. Since we have transported back to Voyager, you avoid showing me any affection in front of our friends that I have been accustomed to. We have yet to  acknowledge the development of our feelings toward one another," Seven passionately stated, "openly like other couples do on Voyager."</p>
<p>"I can only conclude," Seven continued, her face flushed, "that you find it difficult to express your feelings towards ME, since you have been able to in the past with Mr. Paris."</p>
<p>"Don't compare what I have for you with my relationship with Tom," B'Elanna seethed.  She took a step back, looking away for a moment, and calmed herself. "What I had with him was in some ways...immature. How could you ever think I would be ashamed to be with you?"</p>
<p>"I am Borg. When we first interacted, you made that clear whenever you pointed out what I did was Borg. Isn't that why you disliked me?"</p>
<p>B'Elanna was flabbergasted.  "I may not like the Borg Collective, but I didn't dislike you just because you were Borg. I never ever felt hatred for you, Seven. I didn't like you at first because you were so smug in your attitude of Borg superiority. You made it seem like the rest of us were inferior."</p>
<p>"But when you were learning to be human again, when you acted for the good of the crew, my opinion of you changed. You were just like the rest of us, became a valued member of this crew. Sure, we didn't always get along, but I've never felt embarrassed to be associated with you."</p>
<p>B'Elanna could feel the tears welling up in her eyes, but she held back the sob. Seven turned her gaze away unable to bear the hurt expression on the other woman's face.</p>
<p>"Then why do you distance yourself from me when we are out in the corridors, in the Mess Hall... I suggest dinner with Harry Kim, so that we may integrate our lives together, and yet you do not wish to..." Seven couldn't continue, the words would not come even though the tears were abundant.</p>
<p>"I just don't want to share you right now. It's hard enough to have time for one another now that we're here," B'Elanna answered, her eyes pleading.</p>
<p>"But that's not going to improve. We will always have interruptions, jobs, duties, other people we have to attend to," Seven countered, a frown creasing her normally smooth brow. "What is it, Bey?" she implored.</p>
<p>"I guess...I guess I'm just scared," B'Elanna told her when she finally replied.</p>
<p>"What are you scared of?" Seven asked, gently taking B'Elanna's hands in her own and stepping close enough so their bodies grazed.</p>
<p>"That we're not ready," she murmured.</p>
<p>Seven took the smaller woman in her arms, and whispered, "We are."  </p>
<p>B'Elanna nodded with all the confidence she could muster. "You're late for your cycle. I should get you to the Cargo Bay." She forestalled the argument from Seven's lips. "We'll work it out, but not all in one night."</p>
<p>Seven acquiesced, feeling completely worn out by the conversation. At least, she had some idea of what was causing her love so much distress. Inexperienced in the matters of the heart, B'Elanna's fears triggered her own, and Seven failed to realize that one single declaration of love from her might have banished the Klingon's doubts away.</p>

</table>

<p>The lieutenant reported to Engineering the next morning, looking forward to returning to duty. It gave her something to take her mind off of what she and Seven had gone through last night. She needed the petty assignments to divert her attention from what she had to tell Seven. After she had accompanied the ex-drone back to her alcove, B'Elanna had used most of the night thinking about their relationship, what was best for Seven, and what Janeway felt for the ex-drone, putting her own feelings aside.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, the ship lurched, and B'Elanna was thrown against the console she was working at. It was as if the ship had struck an object, and B'Elanna scrambled over to the diagnostic panels to find out what was going on. Lt. Carey was half a second behind her. The power readings to the warp core were low as if the core had been drained, and the engines were off-line.</p>
<p>"Bridge to Engineering," the Captain's voice blared over the comm. "We've hit a spatial rift. Report."</p>
<p>"Warp engines are off-line, possibly due to damage to the plasma injectors. I'll get a team working on them. Long range sensors are also damaged, might be the rift emitting dechyon particles," Carey hypothesized. </p>
<p>"I need those sensors back online within the hour, Lieutenant, if we're going to navigate through this part of space," Janeway made it known.</p>
<p>"Aye, Captain."</p>
<p>Lt. Carey looked over to B'Elanna, and rolled his eyes, believing this was only the start of their problems. He started passing out assignments to the Engineering staff, and sent B'Elanna to work on the sensors, knowing she would be the one fastest enough to assess the damage and figure out a way to fix them within the time frame.</p>
<p>"Lt. Carey to Seven of Nine," he hailed, surprising the half-Klingon mid-step when she turned around to head towards the equipment lockers.</p>
<p>"Seven of Nine here."</p>
<p>"Seven, Astrometrics isn't going to be much use if we don't get the long range sensors back online. Can you come down and help Lt. Torres with the repairs?" Carey requested, as B'Elanna's eyebrows shot up.</p>
<p>There was a slight pause, then Seven responded, "I will be there shortly."</p>
<p>Not wasting one more second, B'Elanna jogged over to the diagnostic console for shipwide systems to track down the problem. It took a few minutes, but she located the source of the damage to one of the EPS conduits located near the plasma manifold in Jefferies tube junction 918. By then, the Borg had arrived in Engineering and joined the lieutenant. There was an initial awkward moment of silence, but both were professional enough to dissociate their emotions from their work, and made their way over to the access port. They crawled a short distance through the Jefferies tube to the EPS conduit, and in a matter of minutes, already made headway in the repairs.</p>
<p>"Did you sleep well, B'Elanna?" Seven inquired, even as she realigned the circuitry.</p>
<p>Sighing, the half-Klingon admitted, "Not really," as she removed the last piece of the damaged conduit, never to be used again.</p>
<p>"I wish I could have held you..."</p>
<p>"Yeah," B'Elanna replied softly, snapping in the new replacement.</p>
<p>Seven scanned it with a tricorder, noting that the temporary rearrangements would provide power to the sensor array and allow the afferent data stream to feed directly to Ops on the bridge.</p>
<p>"We are finished here," Seven informed her.</p>
<p>"Wow, we should tag team more often," B'Elanna quipped, injecting a little humor into the situation.</p>
<p>Seven gave her a wry look, and packed their instruments. Before she could comment, they heard a familiar voice calling down the tube.</p>
<p>"You guys need any help here?" Harry asked as he poked his head into the hatch opening.</p>
<p>B'Elanna smiled. Harry had that affect on her, maybe because he always seemed so goofy in a good way.</p>
<p>"You're too late!" she yelled over.</p>
<p>"Great. Then maybe you guys can help me alter the sensors so we can find these spatial rifts and seal them."          </p>
<p>B'Elanna snorted, and tilted her head toward the hatch, indicating that they should get out of the Jefferies tube and go help Harry. Seven smirked and followed the more compact woman out of the confined surroundings. Buzzing with activity, Engineering looked like a zoo, when the lieutenant finally slipped out of the opening, with extra personnel having been called in to work on the ship repairs. All of the repair assignments and duty stations were covered, though somewhat excessively and almost inefficiently, B'Elanna noticed, but Carey was still new at running the department. </p>
<p>Seven had one long leg out of the hatch when her other foot got caught on the trimming of the Jefferies tube. She leaned back into the tube to maneuver her foot, letting out a small exhale, when she felt another hand on her ankle. </p>
<p>Something had clicked inside the Klingon's brain, something along the lines of 'foot not working--go help,' and B'Elanna had automatically responded to it, having performed similar actions when Seven was injured. </p>
<p>B'Elanna reached in, freed Seven's foot, and scooped up the young Borg in her arms, setting her down outside the access hatch. Caught off guard, Seven released her hold around B'Elanna's neck hesitantly, and murmured a quiet thanks. </p>
<p>Harry was visibly surprised to say the least, after observing the entire incident along with Ensign Bristow, who was only a couple of feet away. Bristow, who suffered from a unrequited crush on the former Chief Engineer, stopped breathing all together. </p>
<p>From across the walkway, a few crewmembers exchanged curious looks. They had seen the lieutenant carry Seven out of the opening, almost lovingly. The two women's reputation for not getting along was infamous, and therefore the whole event had been a shock to those who happened to have glanced in that direction at that particular moment. </p>
<p>Even Seven didn't know what to make of it, and she blushed uncontrollably as she stood next to her companion. B'Elanna caught their stares. Though she wasn't Chief Engineer anymore, her presence was still commanding. </p>
<p>"You all didn't get enough assignments?" she asked rather acidly.    </p>
<p>The young officers promptly put their eyes back into their sockets and went back to work. Harry shrugged, and lead them over to the sensor consoles. He had suffered B'Elanna's temper before, and by now he knew when she was being truly serious and when she was not.        </p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Seven had returned to Astrometrics when the long range sensors had been recalibrated. An hour later, that left B'Elanna and Harry alone as they made their way to the Mess Hall to grab a bite before returning to their respective posts.              </p>
<p>"So.... What was that all about?" Harry couldn't keep his tongue any longer, as he peered at his friend.</p>
<p>"Harry, did anyone ever tell you that you're nosier than a Ferrengi bartender?" B'Elanna remarked, not even dignifying the question with an answer.</p>
<p>"Oh, come on, B'Elanna. It was really obvious. What's going on between the two of you?"</p>
<p>"I don't want to talk about it right now."</p>
<p>After they had obtained their food and sat down at a table, Harry decided to broach the subject again, his curiosity getting the better of him.</p>
<p>"You know, when I fell in love with Marayna from the Holodeck, you told me you saw it in the way I looked at her," Harry recalled. </p>
<p>B'Elanna dropped her fork, and fixed a dangerous glare on him. "What do you want me to say, Harry?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. Just that I recognize the look. Heck, I used to look at Seven that way." He raised his hand when B'Elanna opened her mouth to speak. "BUT, I don't anymore. You can rest assure that my feelings won't be hurt," he said gallantly.</p>
<p>The half-Klingon let out a short chortle. "I'll remember you said that."</p>
<p>"You deserve to be happy. Does Seven know?"</p>
<p>Shrugging, B'Elanna replied casually, "She knows I care about her." </p>
<p>"God, you're worse than me."</p>
<p>She almost choked on his comment.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>The rest of the day went by quickly for Seven. With Tal Celes and Icheb assisting her, Seven charted a preliminary safe path through the region avoiding the more dangerous spatial rifts. Some of the rifts were actually multi-dimensional, and the bridge crew  was occupied for most of the day trying to seal them, stabilizing that area of space. By 1800 hours, Seven completed her tasks and was eager to leave and find B'Elanna. Unfortunately, Captain Janeway dropped by to see her, needlessly concerned about her first day back on duty, which she made sure to point out.</p>
<p>Kathryn just laughed and patted the beautiful blonde on the shoulder. At the Captain's request, Seven showed her the course the she had plotted for Voyager to use once they repaired the warp engines. It seemed to Seven that the Captain was more interested in observing her as she spoke rather than the stellar map displayed on screen, and was standing quite close, enough to invade her, what humans termed, "personal space."</p>
<p>"Seven," Janeway spoke softly.</p>
<p>"Yes, Captain." </p>
<p>From the small distance, Seven could see the smooth contours of the smaller woman's face. Kathryn Janeway had aged nicely. </p>
<p>"I haven't told you how much I missed you when you were gone. I was worried that I had lost the both of you."</p>
<p>Seven didn't know what to say, but she was touched by the sentiment. "I missed your presence as well."</p>
<p>"You've grown, in a way, since you set out on the away mission. It's hard to explain, but it's almost as if you've become more open and expressive," Janeway marveled, placing a warm, gentle hand behind Seven's shoulder.</p>
<p>"I...I learned a great deal from my experiences, and from B'Elanna."</p>
<p>"How remarkable...." There was a long pause as the two women gazed at each other, no longer as mentor and student, but as two adults seeing past the exterior and the rank. "Would you like to join me for dinner tonight?" Kathryn asked.</p>
<p>B'Elanna chose to enter at that moment and paused near the doorway, finding the two of them standing close, their faces less than a foot apart. Oh, she tried not to get jealous, not to let the sight of their intimacy take a stab at her heart, but it was difficult. Even though her expression remained impassive, the sick twisting feeling in her chest left her breathless and in pain. And the touch. Janeway was touching Seven. Not in the friendly sort of manner a good buddy would casually dole out every now and then, but an actual caress only one might imagine a lover would give.</p>
<p>Sensing the Klingon's presence, Seven moved away, flustered, and unable to decide what to tell the Captain. Kathryn resolved the situation for her.</p>
<p>Glancing over to the lieutenant, Janeway said, "I see you still have some work to do, Seven. I'll leave you both to it. Let me know what you decide later."</p>
<p>Janeway walked over to B'Elanna on her way out of Astrometrics. "How's everything going down in Engineering? Getting back into the swing of things?" Kathryn asked, grinning warmly at the younger woman, unaware of the tension between them.</p>
<p>"Fine, Captain. Things are going smoothly," B'Elanna reported, her voice steady, but her complexion pale.</p>
<p>"Good. Let me know if you have any problems," called back over her shoulder as she strode out of the room.</p>
<p>"I was just about to find you, B'Elanna," Seven told the lieutenant as she moved over to the Borg's side.</p>
<p>"Until Captain Janeway invited you to dinner," B'Elanna added.</p>
<p>"I will decline so that we can spend the evening together," Seven replied, hoping they could bridge the gap that had formed in their relationship since they returned from the planet.</p>
<p>B'Elanna strolled up the steps to the large screen, and stood quietly admiring the view of stellar space and all its magnificent natural wonders. Seven surveyed her silence patiently, noting the way even the most enchanting elements of the universe could not compare with the Klingon-Human hybrid. Of all the qualities B'Elanna's lineage had assimilated, somehow the most perfect blend of attributes had combined to create this woman.</p>
<p>Looking out into the stars, B'Elanna felt her initial jealousy and heartache subside. It had taken her a long time to come to the point where she was now, a lot of thinking, a lot of debating, and most of all, a lot of crying last night, but the half-Klingon knew that what she was about to do was for the best. Maybe Seven wouldn't understand it right away, but the Borg needed the truth.</p>
<p>"Seven, have you ever noticed the way the Captain treats you differently from the rest of the crew?" B'Elanna asked, not trusting herself to look at the young woman just yet.</p>
<p>It was an odd question coming from B'Elanna, but Seven was willing to indulge the discussion. "Captain Janeway had taken it upon herself to guide me in developing my individuality when I was first separated from the Collective."</p>
<p>"Do you think, if we hadn't been stranded on that planet, that you and the Captain would have eventually...formed a romantic relationship?"</p>
<p>Seven frowned. "B'Elanna, why are you asking this?" </p>
<p>"I just want to know..." B'Elanna folded her arms, still facing away from the ex-drone.</p>
<p>"The Captain and I are friends." She emphasized the last word, as she walked up to the platform. "Do you doubt the sincerity of my feelings toward you?"</p>
<p>B'Elanna turned and gazed into Seven's eyes. "No," she said softly.</p>
<p>"Do you doubt my ability to have feelings for you?"</p>
<p>"Never," the lieutenant denied, shaking her head slightly. She swallowed hard and tried to again. "Don't you ever notice the way the Captain looks at you?"</p>
<p>Seven creased her brow in confusion.</p>
<p>"I think the Captain is interested in you, Seven. I think she wants more than just a friendship."</p>
<p>"You are wrong," Seven angrily protested. "The Captain and I have a platonic relationship, and you will not cheapen it by making her intentions obscene."</p>
<p>"That's not what I'm trying to say," B'Elanna replied, putting her hand on Seven's arm to soothe the Borg. "Seven, in all the time you've spent with the Captain, you've never thought of her from a romantic prospective? We've all seen the way you two interact. Can you tell me honestly that you've never considered Janeway as a potential lover?"</p>
<p>"My past feelings are irrelevant. What is relevant here are my feelings for you." Seven felt uncomfortable with the direction the conversation had turned. Hands clenched tightly at her side, she moved away from the other woman.</p>
<p>"You didn't answer my question," B'Elanna noted, as she came up behind the ex-drone.</p>
<p>"I don't see the point in answering," she replied, taking in a deep breath as the situation felt suffocating. "But if you must force me to.... I have wondered in the past, but those thoughts were fleeting. It is illogical to dwell on them. What I want now is to be with you."</p>
<p>"But you still feel something for her, don't you. When she looks at you with all her focus, when she touches you in that gentle, comforting manner, when she drops everything else to assure your well-being, it draws you to her, doesn't it?"</p>
<p>Seven tried to fight the images, the memories that came to mind of the petite, auburn-hair woman with the powerful presence, the one who guided her, demanded her loyalty and won it. They had spent so many hours together alone, sharing an understanding of what it meant to be isolated from the rest of the crew. </p>
<p>"I do not comprehend what you are attempting to do B'Elanna. Do you wish to terminate our relationship?" Seven questioned, her anguish growing with each second. She did not understand why humans like to play such games.</p>
<p>"I'm not doing this to torture you, Seven," B'Elanna murmured, her voice wavering from her own pain as she spoke. "But I can't...we can't ignore the fact that part of you loves Kathryn Janeway."</p>
<p>"Just as part of you loves Tom Paris," Seven countered, giving B'Elanna an accusing look.</p>
<p>"Okay, that's true. However, I've had closure on that relationship. You haven't had the chance to make a choice yet, with all the possibilities in front of you."</p>
<p>"I have made my choice! I don't know why you can't accept it. Why you don't want me." </p>
<p>Seven voice's was harrowed and passionate. And in a fit of desperation, she struck out at the bulkhead next to her with an open hand, a Borg-enhanced hand. The metal crunched audibly under the blow, and a small dip in the surface remained as a lasting reminder of the ex-drone's heartache. Forgetting her own safety, B'Elanna grabbed Seven about the shoulders, spun her around, hugging onto the blonde tightly, and captured Seven's gaze.</p>
<p>"You listen, Seven. I want you. I want you so much it pains me when you're not around. I just don't want you to have any regrets. To look back one day and think what if.... You and Janeway have a bond, and could have a future together. When we were stranded together on the planet, we didn't know if we would ever be rescued, if we would ever find Voyager." </p>
<p>B'Elanna freed one of her own hands from holding the Borg, and pointed to the two them. "Then, we happened,... and it's wonderful," she continued. "But now we're back on Voyager, and the circumstances have changed. There are other people involved. We can't make mistakes like our parents did by not thinking things through."</p>
<p>Seven sobbed, turning her head away, not wishing to hear anymore of what B'Elanna had to say. "Why do you hurt us, B'Elanna?"</p>
<p>"I don't mean to." B'Elanna wept, knowing she may well have given up the love of her life. "I love you, Ani..."</p>
<p>Seven looked up wonder at the sweet words she had longed to hear from B'Elanna. But what would have given her overwhelming joy was tempered by the emotional turmoil in her heart.</p>
<p>"I wish I could believe you, Bey," Seven responded brokenly.</p>
<p>"Believe me. I love you, and sometimes that means I have to be able to let go of you a little so that you can be your own person and make the decisions you need to make without influence. And if you decide you don't mind settling for a non-practicing half-Klingon engineer..."</p>
<p>Seven stopped crying, and looked at B'Elanna, really looked at her, letting the woman's words seep in. She held the exquisite face in her hand, coming to realize that B'Elanna wasn't breaking up with her. If the Klingon felt she had a choice to make then Seven wasn't going to disappoint. She would consider everything carefully.</p>
<p>"We can still see each other, correct?" Seven asked.</p>
<p>"You better count on it," the Klingon replied, and kissed her.</p>
