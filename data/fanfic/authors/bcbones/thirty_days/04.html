<p>Seven and B'Elanna retreated to their room as soon as they were finished with the dishes. The half-Klingon never imagined that she would enjoy the domestic lifestyle that living in Dannan's house had provided, but of course, she was finding that she enjoyed almost everything she did with Seven. The Borg had found her method of washing each dish individually and thoroughly less than efficient, and suggested an "improved" method. Finally, after much debate, they had settled on a compromise, and completed their chore, but not before a little water fight had broken out. </p>
<p>B'Elanna leaned back against the wall as she reclined on the cot waiting for Seven, who sat in front of the mirror on the night table, to finish putting up her hair. They were going into town today to arrange a new passage off the planet in search of Voyager. The lieutenant didn't know what they were going to do if their search proved futile and Voyager had already determined they were dead after over a week and left. Would they continue to make their way back to the Alpha Quadrant trailing after their ship or return here to live out their lives? The Borg pod was the only Borg system they knew of for light years. B'Elanna couldn't bear the thought of Seven having to live the rest of her life mildly disabled even if her implant functions did not deteriorate any further. Somehow, she would find a way to repair the Borg technology if they were to be stranded on this planet, and heal the ex-drone's condition.</p>
<p>B'Elanna watched through hooded eyes as Seven brushed her hair with long, slow strokes, working out the tangles. If she didn't know better, she thought Seven was actually enjoying the process. The half-Klingon smiled and stood up, moving behind the young Borg. The engineer took the brush from Seven's hand, who looked up at her slightly startled then sighed imperceptibly as B'Elanna began with gentle strokes. B'Elanna drew up the shoulder length blonde tresses and twisted it into a loose bun, leaving some of the end in short wisps to spill freely upwards and out.</p>
<p>"This is not my usual form," Seven noted when the pleasant experience ended, turning her head left and right while glancing in the mirror to examine the bun.</p>
<p>"I know. It's a little more relaxed. We're not on a starship anymore, so I thought you might like something less official looking," B'Elanna explained, liking the way the hair softened the ex-drone's features.</p>
<p>Seven nodded with satisfaction, then froze when B'Elanna caressed the curve of her neck where it met her shoulder. The Klingon loved the baby soft feel of Seven's skin.</p>
<p>"You really are very beautiful, Seven," B'Elanna told her, looking at the reflection of the young Borg.</p>
<p>Seven raised her hand to touch the implant over her brow, wondering if she could see what B'Elanna saw without remembering the pain of her assimilation. B'Elanna didn't mean to make Seven uncomfortable, so she tried a different approach instead.</p>
<p>Leaning down, she grinned and said, "And I'm not just talking about that pretty face of yours, especially when you're jealous," kissing Seven playfully on the nose afterwards.</p>
<p>"You are attempting to make amends for your sexual indiscretion," Seven remarked as she looked up at the lieutenant, trying to keep a stern look on her face, but failing.</p>
<p>"Hey, there was nothing 'sexual' about it!" B'Elanna cried indignantly, hands on her hips.</p>
<p>"You were gone for fifty-two minutes and thirty-seven seconds," Seven pointed out, standing up from the chair.</p>
<p>"I had a tattoo painfully etched on me, remember? Besides, sex doesn't need to take that long," B'Elanna joked.</p>
<p>"Indeed. Sex does not." </p>
<p>Seven didn't seemed to be joking at that moment, as they both gazed at each other. B'Elanna found it difficult to hide her longing, the thought of making love slowly to the young woman crossed her mind. </p>
<p>"Perhaps, I should obtain my own skin decoration," Seven said with a smirk.</p>
<p>Shaking her head, B'Elanna grinned and replied, "Oh no, you don't. If you want a tattoo, I'll give you one..."</p>
<p>Seven pulled the chair between them when she saw the feral expression on B'Elanna's face, her Klingon passion easily provoked.  She laughed as she ran around the small room, keeping the lieutenant at bay with the chair, until the woman leaped over the chair and tackled her onto the bed. The bed springs squeaked audibly with effort. Seven let out a squeal as B'Elanna latched onto her neck with her lips and started sucking away like a leech. B'Elanna was attempting to give her a "hickey," if she recalled correctly from her research on human mating practices. It was not as unpleasant as she had pictured from the data. Finally, she was able to push B'Elanna up away from her, both giggling ridiculously like children. B'Elanna tried to shush them both unsuccessfully, peering nervously at the door. Instead, Seven grasped the half-Klingon's shirt by the shoulders and tugged her down for a kiss, effectively ending the giggle fest. </p>
<p>Outside their room, Dannan and Edyn sat at the table sipping a few early morning ales, chuckling at the noises they heard.</p>
<p>"Gods, we're we ever that young?" Dannan murmured, looking into his glass.</p>
<p>"Hey, speak for yourself. I've got a few good skirt-chasing years left in me," Edyn answered, imagining all sorts of things that might be happening behind that closed door which would produce so much squealing and giggling.</p>
<p>"Maybe the skirt of your nurse," Dannan retorted.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>B'Elanna and Seven stepped out of the sandy streets into Dannan's shop. They both agreed to assist Dannan in the morning and make their way later over to the bar to see if they could arrange a new passage off the planet in search of Voyager. They cranked out the work efficiently between the three of them, and by mid-morning, took an break to stretch the kinks out of their backs.</p>
<p>Dannan walked over to his desk on the far corner of the shop and pulled out a drawer. He picked up the forgotten item in his hand, and brought it over to B'Elanna who was leaning on a elbow across the table, watching Seven polish her recent work.</p>
<p>"Did you want to finish this, Bey?" he asked her as he handed over the small rectangular device.</p>
<p>"No," she replied abruptly, after taking one look at the machine, and handed it back. She seemed almost embarrassed by it.</p>
<p>Seven noticed the exchange and reached out before she could be stopped to see the device for herself, much to B'Elanna's dismay. The device had a small screen with several touch buttons along the sides, but it didn't appear to be functional.</p>
<p>"What is it?" she inquired. When she did not find the answer forthcoming from B'Elanna, she looked towards Dannan.</p>
<p>"Ay,.... It is a game box. Bey was repairing and updating it," Dannan replied vaguely, getting his cue from B'Elanna's body language.</p>
<p>"Is it valuable? What is it's purpose?" Seven took less than a few seconds to size up the simple design.</p>
<p>"It is just for pleasure, Ani, a game which occupies the time," Dannan elaborated.</p>
<p>"Are you selling it, Dannan?" Seven asked, still confused by the concept of the little machine.</p>
<p>"It was for you," B'Elanna answered lamely. </p>
<p>"For me? You spent your productivity on this?" Seven asked, arching her brow at B'Elanna.</p>
<p>"I thought it might have helped with your boredom, before we found the Borg pod," B'Elanna replied flushing, even more embarrassed now. "It seemed like a good idea at the time."</p>
<p>Seven noticed her discomfort, and wanted to put her at ease, realizing she must have gone to a great deal of trouble fixing the game box for her. B'Elanna reached out to take the game box away, but Seven turned, clutching the device to her chest, worried that B'Elanna would take her gift back. </p>
<p>"Then it belongs to me, does it not?" Seven noted.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I guess it does," B'Elanna told her quietly, wondering what the ex-drone was thinking.</p>
<p>B'Elanna came around to Seven's side, but Seven kept turning from her as if B'Elanna was trying to take the box away.</p>
<p>"Here, let me activate it," B'Elanna prompted. </p>
<p>She took the device and flipped it over, pulling away a tiny panel and snapped something inside. She replaced the panel and pushed the switch at the top of the device to "On." The machine booped and beeped noisily as it booted the game. Seven retrieved the machine, curious as to what sort of game it contained.</p>
<p>"Wait, I have to show you how to play," B'Elanna protested, trying not to laugh at the Borg's eagerness.</p>
<p>"I am Borg. You will not deter me from winning this game," Seven gave her patented answer, her eyes fastened on the screen.</p>
<p>B'Elanna watched as the Borg discovered each of the buttons' particular function for herself. But as soon as she turned away, she heard the dismal sound of the loser's jingle. The knit in Seven's brow told her that the ex-drone did not like that particular sound.</p>
<p>"Seven, the goal of the game is to take the three dimensional shapes and fit them together so that they will form a level plane. The shapes fall from the top of the screen so within that time frame, you may want to turn the shape to the correct axis and move it so that it fits well with the other pieces. Once the shapes form a level plane, that plane disappears," B'Elanna explained. "The point of the game is to not allow the shapes stack up to the top of the screen or you will lose. And sometimes it's better to stack up the shapes in a way so that you can get rid of a bunch of levels when the right piece comes along, rather than rushing."</p>
<p>"Oh, and the level of difficulty increases as you successfully win each game," she added, forestalling Seven's next obvious comment. "And don't use your ocular implant."</p>
<p>Almost wanting to stick her tongue out like Naomi Wildman would, Seven replied, "I understand, and I will adapt."</p>
<p>Seven started the game again and began to play, even as Dannan and B'Elanna watched on, shaking their heads when she became completely engrossed. Internally, however, the half-Klingon was tickled pink that Seven would like something as mundane as what B'Elanna had given her.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>The "Hyperdrive" was packed as usual with it's afternoon crowd, most of them having just woken up, hoping to cure their hangovers with what gave it to them in the first place. With their faces hidden by their hoods, B'Elanna and Seven wandered over to the bar and ordered their drinks, mostly for show on Seven's part since the Borg knew she could not hold her liquor from past experience. They eyed an open table along the right wall that was moderately well lit and sat down, observing the band as it played to the audience. It was packed today, probably because a new influx of ships brought along their cooped up crew from the ends of the sector.</p>
<p>B'Elanna looked over the lip of her glass and scanned the room as she sipped her bitter brew. Once again, she stretched back to her old Maquis experience, remembering the times when she and Chakotay made their contacts in similar watering holes, trying to negotiate contraband and information regarding the movements of the Cardassian military. She came to the conclusion that one hole-in-the-wall was like any other hole-in-the-wall; stuffy, dark, seedy, but teaming with possibilities only the underbelly of civilization could provide. She scrutinized one particular alien several tables down toward the stage. The bartender had pointed him out earlier because he ran a transport vessel that traveled farther than most.</p>
<p>Seven fingered her drink, occasionally taking what looked like a guzzle, but in truth her sense of smell had already warned her of its caustic properties. She stared with frank fascination at how B'Elanna was able to swallow the contents of her glass without reaction. She found herself looking at the half-Klingon often, observing her gestures and expressions, frequently surprising herself at the amount of pleasure she took from it. Seven could tell B'Elanna was very focused at the moment, her brown eyes narrowed, her curved nose pinched and full lips pursed. Suddenly, those big brown eyes turned to look at her, caught her staring.  </p>
<p>Eyes glinting with humor, B'Elanna asked her, "So, are we in this all the way?"</p>
<p>Seven nodded slightly. "I have responsibilities on Voyager. The children are in my care, and I cannot abandon them."</p>
<p>The Borg suppressed her own emotions on the subject, aware of their effect each time she thought about her own childhood loss. B'Elanna must have sensed the gravity of her admission because she slipped a hand over to cover one of hers. The touched lingered for a minute.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna go and try to strike a deal with that man over there. Watch my back?" the lieutenant requested.</p>
<p>"This time will not be an exception," Seven answered, quirking her brow high.</p>
<p>B'Elanna snorted as she walked away, and Seven indeed watched her back, as well as the fine sway of her hips and the firm shape of her behind. The ex-drone folded her arms and pushed her chair back against the wall so that she might have a better view of the room and all its customers. </p>
<p>Twenty minutes and a couple of beers later, B'Elanna headed back to their table, having negotiated a new arrangement. She wove her way around the rowdy crowd, and discovered an unwanted visitor standing at their table, who was talking to Seven. The Klingon came around to her chair, planting herself down abruptly, and glowered coolly at the alien. The alien was medium height, broad shouldered, with thick arms and legs, but had a pot belly that stuck out too far for his shirt to cover completely. His unshaven angular face, bushy black hair and brows on an otherwise unremarkable humanoid face did nothing to endear him. Neither did his greasy T-shirt and weathered leathery pants. The alien welcomed her presence with a thin smile.</p>
<p>"Is there a problem?" B'Elanna asked, not relenting her glare at the alien as she pressed back into her chair.</p>
<p>"Mr. Rul here offered to purchase another drink for me. I have declined," Seven informed her.</p>
<p>"Well, I guess you'll have to excuse us then," B'Elanna hinted, not so subtly, tilting her head towards the crowd.</p>
<p>"Oh, come on now. What's a little harm in sharing a round of drinks? The more the merrier," Rul persuaded in a deep raspy voice, placing his hands on the table surface and leaning down towards Seven. The brief glimpse of her golden hair had attracted his attention as it was rarity seen in his colony. </p>
<p>"Perhaps another time," Seven proposed, knowing that they would not be back if all went well.</p>
<p>But the alien wouldn't budge. Instead he pushed, "Not later, now."</p>
<p>That was it. B'Elanna tried to be patient, but her temper flared. The man's persistence was definitely getting on her nerves, and her Klingon pride was asserting itself. She stood up and placed her own hand on the table, leaning her face forward to confront Rul.</p>
<p>"Like she said, another time," she growled, grinding her teeth in the process.</p>
<p>It amused Seven to no end that B'Elanna never seemed to give consideration to the size differences between herself and those she challenged. Rolling her eyes, she observed as both of them postured aggressively. To Seven's amazement, the lieutenant seemed to bristle and grow in stoutness as she tensed her Klingon body plating. One of the alien's friends two tables away seemed to notice what was going on, and called over to Rul.</p>
<p>"Hey, give it a break. That's one of the Nokk champions. You might want to listen to her," he laughed.</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, Rul re-sized the half-Klingon, and said, "Next time then."</p>
<p>No one knew exactly how it happened, but as the alien retreated away from their table, he tripped and fell backwards against the next table. His hip must have jostled the surface hard causing the drinks it held to tip over and spill onto the occupants, a bunch of muscular, furry creatures.  One of them stood, grasping Rul's shirt with a hairy paw. </p>
<p>B'Elanna's eyes widened as she murmured to Seven, "Better get ready to duck!"</p>
<p>Seven took a second to note the glee in the lieutenant's voice before she had to jerk away from her chair as Rul came flying back towards their table, pinning it against the wall. But he was fairly resilient, having been in a number of these brawls. He jumped back up and joined the fray that his friends and the furry beasts had started. B'Elanna flipped their table onto its side, and pulled Seven behind it as she peered around the edge, watching the skirmish. They heard glass crashing behind them against the wall as those watching on the periphery began tossing their drinks. B'Elanna was about to jump into the fight when they heard weapons fire. A blast from across the room bore a hole through their table, barely missing Seven's nose, and B'Elanna realized that things were getting out of hand. She motioned for Seven to follow her as she drew out her disrupter from the holster at her waist. They ducked and crawled through the crowd, hiding behind the overturned tables, towards the entrance of the bar. A meaty hand grabbed Seven arm and pulled her upright. It was Rul, but Seven had had enough of her experiences with manhandling and knocked the burly man over with a swift jab to the chin.  Unfortunately after that, they were stuck in the mix.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>The door burst open with a kick, and B'Elanna and Seven stumbled out of the opening, running as fast as they could into the alleyway. The half-Klingon was huffing, but her eyes were bright and she had a wicked smile on her face. Seven glanced up and down the alley, and tucked her weapon away when she was satisfied that no one had followed them out of the bar.</p>
<p>B'Elanna looked up and smiled impudently, "Well, that was one way to spend the afternoon."</p>
<p>"I am overjoyed that you enjoyed yourself, Bey," Seven noted dryly.</p>
<p>B'Elanna shrugged, but Seven allowed herself to smile. She stopped when she saw the look that came over the Klingon's face next.</p>
<p>"Ani!"</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Seven sat up against the rock. They had walked a little distance to the edge of town behind the bar, and took shelter on the ledge of one of the hilly rock formations that enclosed the settlement. The shelf banking above them casted a cool shade. She turned to hear the sound of ripping as B'Elanna tore the helm off her cloak. The half-Klingon looked perturbed as she knelt in front of the ex-drone, and had been silent for a long time. The superficial graze had bled out of proportion to its severity, but B'Elanna had been distraught to discover that Seven had been injured. Carefully, B'Elanna bound the bleeding wound on her left arm with the scrap of cloth.</p>
<p>"Bey?" Seven called out to get her attention.</p>
<p>"Is it too tight?" B'Elanna asked, worry and, perhaps, some anger in her voice.</p>
<p>"No, it is satisfactory. Are you all right?"</p>
<p>B'Elanna stared at her, then murmured finally, "I'm fine, Ani."</p>
<p>"You appear...upset," Seven observed, pulling B'Elanna by the hand, entreating her to sit near her. </p>
<p>B'Elanna sighed as she gazed off into the far distance. "You always seem to get hurt around me."</p>
<p>Seven considered her words, noting the double meaning. "You blame yourself for a random series of events. Perhaps we should blame Lt. Carey for assigning us to the away mission, or my ignoring your order not to touch the EPS conduits."</p>
<p>That brought the lieutenant's attention back. "Well, not when you put it that way," B'Elanna mumbled.</p>
<p>"We have the potential to hurt each other," Seven said quietly, delving further into the matter.</p>
<p>B'Elanna could not look her in the eye, her track record being the worst. Seven edged closer to B'Elanna, placing an arm around her waist. Gently, she turned B'Elanna's face toward hers with the tips of her fingers. B'Elanna looked deeply into her eyes, her gaze containing a bit of sorrow Seven had seen before on Voyager, and the Borg knew the lieutenant was far more sensitive than she ever let on.</p>
<p>"I could be the one to hurt you...," Seven told her. "But is that not all part of having trust in a relationship?"</p>
<p>Tenderly, B'Elanna kissed the Borg on her cheek for what seemed like an eternity.  "How did you get to be so wonderful?" she asked offering a small smile.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it is easy for me, when I am with you," answered Seven, arching her brows, as she pressed herself into B'Elanna's arms for a kiss.</p>
<p>They seemed to be doing more of that of the late. B'Elanna loved the way Seven's kisses kept reminding her of the sweet taste of fresh mid-summer strawberries. Seven never held anything back in her kisses, not her attention, the depth of her emotions, or her physical contact.  It never failed to touch B'Elanna right to the core of her soul and tap into the emotional dam that held her own passion back.  </p>
<p>"What I would give for a patch of grass right now," B'Elanna laughed, when she bumped her head against the rocky shelf above them.</p>
<p>"Our surroundings are somewhat uncomfortable," Seven admitted, glancing around their position at the rough floor of the ledge, her arms wrapping the Klingon in a tight embrace.</p>
<p>B'Elanna rested her face in the nook of Seven's neck, nuzzling the smooth skin. "Want to watch the sunset before we head back to the house?"</p>
<p>"I do not understand the appeal of watching astronomical entities follow the natural pattern of their orbits," Seven wondered aloud, feeling B'Elanna's giggling breaths on her neck. "However, I am sure you will explain it to me."</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Dannan sat on the bench in front of the house, brushing Fessi's belly hair. He had been neglecting the poor animal, not having walked him consistently for the past week, and Fessi had let him know its discontent in a big way. Suffice to say, Dannan immediately began to dote on his beast of burden, who was more like an overgrown, fat pet. Seven and B'Elanna entered the gate just as it had gotten dark, pulling their cloaks off in the safety of their refuge. </p>
<p>"You both are late tonight?" Dannan inquired with a grin for greeting, picking off some of the fur from the animal brush.</p>
<p>"We were involved in an altercation at the 'Hyperdrive,' and thought it would be prudent to avoid the streets," Seven explained.</p>
<p>"Ani!" B'Elanna whispered, in an attempt to stop her.</p>
<p>"Then we decided to 'make out,' and watch the sunset outside the town."</p>
<p>"Ani!"</p>
<p>Of course, Moka chose to walk out of the house to greet them at that moment, wiping her hands on her apron. </p>
<p>"Well, what took you so long? I thought I had to start dinner without you both," Moka asked with an all too innocent smile, even though there was no way she could not have overheard the last few comments Seven made. She just wanted the Klingon to squirm a little more.</p>
<p>Seven opened her mouth to respond, but B'Elanna had come up next to her and nudged her in the ribs.  "I will explain later," was all the Borg replied.</p>
<p>"Oh, shit," B'Elanna muttered.</p>
<p>"Bey, not in front of Moka," a surprised Seven chided.</p>
<p>"No, I really mean it...," B'Elanna growled, as she lifted the sole of her foot up, and glowered at Fessi.</p>
<p>Fessi snorted derisively.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Berek fiddled with the comm for the third time. There was nothing else to do other than improve the transmission of the message their freighter was sending on all subspace channels. The message was simple enough, only one repetitive phrase in an attempt to contact a deep space starship. They were already on the border of the next sector since their launch this morning. There was nothing much to do on the freighter, other than to keep the ship's systems functioning. He narrowed the band width further and isolated a clearer frequency, at least for the next few light years until they reached another pocket of space with increased subspace interference.</p>
<p>"This is the freighter ship, Teresida, attempting to contact the Federation Starship Voyager. Repeat, this is the freighter ship, Teresida, attempting to contact the Federation Starship Voyager...."</p>
<p>Berek suspected that Abcedi was carrying more information privately, but he was instructed to run no other communications. Apparently, Abcedi expected this starship to answer to the message without question.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Ensign Tom Paris adjusted course to new bearings as he piloted the helm of the Delta Flyer. Neelix was off in the back snoozing after his return from Roka Noonan Prime, where he had just finished meeting with the Space Traffic and Trade Ministers. They had no reports regarding their two missing crew members to their frustration. It had been five days since they headed out to meet with the official contacts in this sector, and it had been one disappointment after another. So far, Voyager had no success in locating the whereabouts or news of B'Elanna and Seven.</p>
<p>He tugged at his collar which had been chafing him all day long. In fact, everything seemed to bother him lately, and only Neelix had the patience to calm him every time he vented his frustrations. He heard noises from the aft section, and guessed that Neelix just woke to relieve him for his shift. Either that or he was fixing up a light snack. Neelix's long crest of hair peeked out from the hatchway and the rest of his body followed.</p>
<p>"Okay, Tom. Time for your break," he informed as he stretched out his back.</p>
<p>"Did you have a good nap?" Paris asked, trying to maintain his usual sense of humor.</p>
<p>"A most refreshing nap. I just think back to the Ragosian Waterfalls back on Talaxia, and that makes me fall asleep every time!" he answered cheerfully, as he came up behind the pilot.</p>
<p>"I'm glad," Paris returned. "I've changed our heading to new bearings. Voyager contacted us about an hour ago and told us to meet them on the border of the third sector."</p>
<p>"Understood. I'll hold her steady while you get some rest."</p>
<p>Tom was about to step up from the conn when the comm panel lit up with blip. "It looks like we've picked up a hail on a subspace channel.... I'm gonna patch it through."</p>
<p>-Beep-</p>
<p>"This is the freighter ship, Teresida, attempting to contact the Federation Starship Voyager. Repeat, this is the freighter ship, Teresida, attempting to contact the Federation Starship Voyager...."</p>
<p>Neelix and Paris both exchanged stunned looks before they both scrambled to answer the hail.</p>
<p>"This is the Delta Flyer, from the Federation Starship Voyager. We received your message, please respond," Paris called out anxiously.</p>
<p>"This is Captain Abcedi, on board the Teresida. Who am I speaking with?" the voice over the comm replied.</p>
<p>"This is Ensign Paris of the Federation Starship Voyager. Do you wish to contact our ship?" asked Tom.</p>
<p>"How do we know you are associated with this vessel?" the voice or rather Captain Abcedi asked suspiciously. "I was told to speak to either Captain Janeway or Commander Chakotay or see the vessel USS Voyager herself."</p>
<p>"I can contact my ship and request them to meet us at designated coordinates. It would help if I knew what this was in regards to?" answered Paris.</p>
<p>"We have a message from someone called, B'Elanna Torres. I assume she is your crewmate?"</p>
<p>"Yes, she is. I will contact my ship. Give me the coordinates on where to meet your freighter and I will relay your message," Paris offered happily. Grinning ear to ear, Neelix patted his shoulder enthusiastically at the news.</p>
<p>"Understood," Abcedi replied.</p>
<p>Smiling, Paris keyed in the subspace band, and hailed Voyager, while Neelix adjusted for a new course as the coordinates came through.</p>
<p>"Delta Flyer to Voyager."</p>

<p>As Ani looked on, Dannan wrapped a bandage to keep the healing gel in place around the Borg's thin arm, after he had finished cleaning the wound. His stout hands and fingers were in reality skilled and nimble as he manipulated the material with ease and accuracy. Moka took the basin filled with soap and water to the sink, and emptied it, all the while peering through the window to watch Bey in the back grove. The old woman laughed wickedly at the young woman's expense. Ani had refused to allow the poor woman in the house with the offending boot and had banished her to clean it. Initially, the young Klingon was about to fling it out into the street and be rid of it, until Ani pointed out that it would not be a prudent move, taking into account the hot, scorching sand underfoot everyday. Bey wrinkled her nose at the unpleasant task, as she chipped away at the unwelcome fertilizer with a stick. Lastly, she rinsed the sole with some hot water and plopped the worn boot on the back porch to dry. </p>
<p>B'Elanna entered the house through the extra door to see the newly bandaged arm of Seven of Nine. It was a sight that still bothered her, and when she approached the table, she looked shame-faced in front of the two older persons. She sat pensively at the table, as if waiting for a long lecture from either of them. Moka observed the broad shoulders as they slumped.</p>
<p>"Ani," Moka called to the ex-drone. "Would you please help me with the dishes?"</p>
<p>Sparing a glance at B'Elanna as she got up off her chair, Seven answered, "Of course."</p>
<p>Dannan re-packed the materials he took out from the medical kit, and put the case aside. He had been quiet when he cleaned the wound, but that was his way. He liked to work in silence, to help him concentrate on his task. But now, when that was done, it seemed he needed to come up with something appropriate to say. It worried him and Moka that the two engaged in dangerous activities. Though they had not known the women for long, both Rangoons had developed a quick affection for Bey and Ani. They had filled his house with laughter and tears since their arrival, and when they leave, it would be empty again.  Should he show them the fatherly concern that he had been denied the opportunity to give?</p>
<p>"So.... Did you get to make the arrangements you wanted before the fight broke out?" he asked.</p>
<p>B'Elanna swallowed hard so that she could answer. "Yes, Sir."</p>
<p>Since when did he become a "Sir," he mused. Bey stared down at the table, her attention seemingly more interested in tracing the grain of the wood before her with a finger.</p>
<p>"There was a new flock of ships that docked this morning," he mentioned. "It was probably very rowdy at the Hyperdrive today."</p>
<p>"A little." Bey bit her lip anxiously.</p>
<p>"Fights are pretty common there," Dannan noted, his eyes kind in their reflection.</p>
<p>"They are?" B'Elanna asked, poorly masking her surprise before she tried to cover up. "They are,...usually...in those types of places," she agreed, nodding.</p>
<p>"What happened?" he inquired, as he rested his elbows on the table.</p>
<p>Bey froze for a bit before she found her voice again and replied, "A man who tried to buy Ani a drink stumbled onto a nearby table and spilled beer on a bunch of tall, furry creatures."</p>
<p>He let out a brief chuckle. "These things happen. Sometimes we're caught in the middle. When it does, the only thing we can do is look out for each other."</p>
<p>Bey slumped again. "I guess I didn't do a good job of it," she said dejectedly.</p>
<p>Dannan reached out and clasped her on the shoulder. "You did. These--things--happen. And Ani can take care of herself too," he comforted, patting her shoulder softly, as he captured her eyes purposefully.</p>
<p>Moka hoped the conversation resolved the issue for Bey, for she put herself up against such heavy expectations no one demanded of her. Their dinner was ready as she removed the loaf of bread from the oven, filling the room with its aroma. She handed Seven the other dishes so that she could slice the bread.</p>
<p>Seven cleared her throat as she approached the table, a decidedly human gesture she picked up from the Captain on the bridge. B'Elanna got up halfway to take the dishes from her so that she could return to the kitchen for the rest. Seven trusted that by talking to Dannan, B'Elanna could feel better about the afternoon's incident since the Klingon also cared about the opinion of their caretakers, and she was glad Dannan reiterated her thoughts. Finally, everyone gathered around the table for another rich, wonderful meal prepared by Moka to share together. Seven sat next to B'Elanna, and kissed her on the cheek before she picked up a dish to pass around the table. The gesture was not lost on the lieutenant, who finally snapped out of her funk and cheered up, especially when Seven decided to play footsie under the table with her bare foot.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>B'Elanna was naked, soaking in the tub, and it was heavenly. The past two days had left her body bruised and somewhat sore, though she never showed any signs of her discomfort. She and Seven wanted to leave the doors open between their room and the washroom so they could keep conversing, but it was already late and they didn't want to disturb Dannan and Moka. Instead, the Borg convinced B'Elanna, who was hesitant at first, to take a bubble bath while she remained in the room with her. </p>
<p>The half-Klingon sat in a round tub of warm water, with the lather covering the surface of the tub, all the way up to her collar, and hiding her naked body from Seven's interested gaze. The blonde planted herself on the stool next to the tub at B'Elanna's feet, and rested one arm on the edge of the tub while her other hand dipped into the warm, soapy water, idly playing with it. She watched as B'Elanna worked the soap around her wet, silky shoulders. All of a sudden B'Elanna slapped her hand away, which she didn't even know had wandered.</p>
<p>"Ani," B'Elanna said warningly, raising a brow.</p>
<p>"Why won't you allow me to bathe you, like you did for me?" she asked, her forehead crinkled in a frown.</p>
<p>"Because,... We wouldn't be able to stop things from progressing further," B'Elanna replied, washing the undersides of her firm breasts, the movement causing Seven to catch her breath.</p>
<p>"And that would be........bad?" Seven concluded, finding the correct colloquial term.</p>
<p>B'Elanna stopped what she was doing, and leaned forward slowly until she was a few centimeters away. </p>
<p>Looking into Seven's blue, shimmering eyes, she said, "No. It'd be good,...too good."</p>
<p>Disappointed, Seven grumbled, "I still do not understand."  She truly did not know why B'Elanna did not want to copulate with her, to consummate their relationship, as she had with Ensign Paris.</p>
<p>B'Elanna returned to her original position and rested her head against the rim of the tub, gazing fondly at the woman before her. It was a long time before she answered.</p>
<p>"It's just like watching the sun set, Ani. All things have to follow their natural course."</p>
<p>Seven propped her chin in her other hand, smiling imperceptibly.  'Which is inevitable,' Seven finished quietly in her thoughts, as she returned to playing with the water.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>"Glad to have you back on board," Janeway greeted the men as they exited the turbo lift.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Ma'am," accepted Paris, as he walked down the steps to the lower level of the bridge.</p>
<p>"Good work, the both of you."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Captain," Neelix replied modestly, scratching his whiskers. "Although it seems the message came to us."</p>
<p>Chakotay smiled back. It had been a while since the mood struck him.</p>
<p>"Well, whatever you did, it worked. We know where they are, and now we just have to get there," he told them.</p>
<p>"Harry, could you transfer the coordinates to the helm. Tom take us there at Warp 9," commanded Janeway, as both of her bridge officers acknowledged her orders.</p>
<p>They had obtained the coordinates to the planet B'Elanna and Seven had been on for more than a week now, from a passing freighter. Apparently, the two had crashed there and had to purchase the services of a certain "Captain Abcedi" to relay a message for them.</p>
<p>"I'll be in my Ready Room," she added.</p>
<p>Janeway walked over to her haven. She was ecstatic with joy, but she didn't want to show it in front of her crew. She needed to keep a tight control over her emotions because she didn't want to demonstrate what could have been misconstrued as favoritism. Reaching the confines of her chamber, she flopped down onto her couch with relief. The tension and sadness of the past several days seemed to have been lifted. She was still worried since her two crewmembers were as yet to be safely back on the ship, but at least they had finally been located after all the searching they had done. Voyager had passed by the planet a few days ago with no signs of the two women's presence, and had been unable trace the whereabouts of the shuttle either. The women must have hid themselves well among the inhabitants, and that meant they had been hiding from trouble. </p>
<p>Janeway released a big breath, and rubbed her neck while she sauntered over to the replicator for a nice cup of coffee. Sitting at her desk, she thought about seeing her wayward drone again, something she was starting to anticipate. It was times like these that made one appreciate what one had, and Janeway valued her relationship with her Borg. They had formed a mentor-student bond initially, that eventually evolved into a kind of friendship. Seven was one of the few people she spent her off-hours with, which weren't many.  She had encouraged the young Borg to embrace her humanity, and now the captain wondered if the ex-drone was ready for more.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>The game box chirped away noisily as B'Elanna played it feverishly. The half-Klingon was lying prone on the bed, her legs swinging casually in the air, while Seven was making more use of her time repairing the damaged tricorder. The half-Klingon broke out with an occasional cackle or an odd assortment of grunts and groans, even though Seven was trying hard to concentrate, sincerely working at the night table. What was even more distracting were the quick glimpses of the tone thighs and cotton briefs under the short, gun-metal sleeping gown B'Elanna had changed into. And to her distress, the ex-drone was having her first experience of sexual frustration that had been escalating ever since they had admitted their blossoming feelings for each other. When the lieutenant shrieked again, Seven put her tool down and rose from her chair, approaching B'Elanna from behind in a quiet slink. </p>
<p>"Hey!" B'Elanna cried out, looking over her shoulder when Seven snatched the game away. "No fair! I was about to beat your score."</p>
<p>"Ah, an additional benefit," Seven replied as she carefully put the game aside. </p>
<p>Then Seven turned the half-Klingon over and stretched herself out between the caramel-colored thighs. Beguiled, B'Elanna watched her with a smirk, as the ex-drone climbed up the athletic, yet soft body. Seven reached up and brushed her full lips teasingly against B'Elanna's, then trailed her kisses along the strong jaw.</p>
<p>"Is there something you wanted, Ani?" B'Elanna asked, the humor in her tone evident.</p>
<p>Seven sat up and peered at her curiously, "My attempt at seducing you is not obvious? Is my performance insufficient?"</p>
<p>Laughing, B'Elanna took the sides of Seven's face between her hands and pulled the quirky, yet at this moment, extremely sexy blonde to her waiting lips and tongue. </p>
<p>"Mmm...," B'Elanna moaned as she felt Seven's tongue respond, caressing and swirling around her own.</p>
<p>It would have been so easy to let things progress. Kahless knows how much she wanted to make love to the young Borg, but B'Elanna couldn't. And it wasn't because she never made love to another woman before, although that was still something she kept in mind. Even though her own body was screaming for B'Elanna to comply, the weight of their plans kept her passionate fires in check, both her human and Klingon halves. Instead, B'Elanna returned the young woman's passion with tenderness.</p>
<p>After a few moments of bliss, the half-Klingon rolled them onto their sides. Seven separated from her, pulling a pillow under her head and gazed up at her with intoxicating doe eyes. B'Elanna cupped Seven's alabaster cheek and stroked the warm flesh with her thumb.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking about?" Seven asked, desiring to share whatever bothered her companion.</p>
<p>B'Elanna looked at her suspiciously, "What are you, part Betazoid?"</p>
<p>"I have no Betazoid DNA," Seven replied, puzzled.</p>
<p>"I know... But you seem to be able to read me, and that's scary," the lieutenant said wryly.</p>
<p>"What is preoccupying your thoughts? Please tell me," Seven persisted, grasping hold of B'Elanna's arm.</p>
<p>B'Elanna opened her mouth hesitantly, swallowed, and tried again. "I guess I'm thinking about when we leave here, and having to say goodbye."</p>
<p>Seven nodded in agreement. "I believe I will find it difficult to say goodbye to the friends we have made here."</p>
<p>"We've met some pretty special people, haven't we?" B'Elanna noted wistfully.</p>
<p>"You respect Dannan a great deal," observed Seven, after which B'Elanna threw her a questioning glance. "His approval is important to you. Why?"</p>
<p>The half-Klingon sighed, as she folded her hands under her pillow and snuggled further into the covers. "He reminds me of what's it like to have father. Someone who looks out for you. I had forgotten. And Dannan..., he's such a wise and kind man..., cares unconditionally...."</p>
<p>Her eyes reddened slightly, and B'Elanna tightened her face to keep her emotions under control. "I can't believe it still affects me the way it does."</p>
<p>"You were a young child. You were not emotionally prepared for your loss," Seven responded, trying to comfort her.</p>
<p>"I was five when my mother told me my father had left. I remember wondering why. Why would he leave? I wondered why he didn't love me enough to stay? Why he didn't love me enough to find me? My mother and I moved to Kessick IV afterwards, but it was a Federation colony and my mother did research for the Federation...," B'Elanna continued as tears began to stream down her face. "All I could think of at the time...was that I was Klingon."</p>
<p>B'Elanna covered her face with her hands, not wanting to weep uncontrollably in front of the young Borg. Seven reached forward and kissed her fingertips, hoping to ease the pain and take away the tears. Seven removed B'Elanna's hands, finding her tortured face underneath, and laid sweet, gentle kisses on her eyelids, tasting the salty moisture.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," the half-Klingon murmured in a hushed but raw voice.</p>
<p>"Do not apologize for your feelings," Seven told her, as she coaxed with a caress B'Elanna to look at her. "I believe I understand them."</p>
<p>Eyes still wet, B'Elanna searched Seven's face thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"After I was severed from the collective, I began to remember events before I was assimilated. And when I read the logs my parents made during their journey towards Borg space, I realized how much they had been willing to sacrifice in pursuit of the Borg. That their research was more important than the well-being of their only child."</p>
<p>Seven pressed ahead and revealed what haunted her deepest thoughts, the thing that she feared the most was true, when she was alone in the quiet of her Cargo Bay.  "That, perhaps, they loved their research more than they loved me," she gasped, as her own tears clouded her face.</p>
<p>"Oh, Ani." B'Elanna cradled the trembling young woman to her bosom, and kissed the top of her head, whispering soft reassurances and endearments . The half-Klingon would never in her life wish the same pain upon anyone else, of growing up thinking one was unwanted and less than adequate.</p>
<p>"I know about your parents' logs. They thought what they were doing was safe," B'Elanna comforted. "Your parents loved you, Ani, they really did. But they were only human, and they made a mistake with the only experience they had then. You have to forgive them for it."</p>
<p>At last, Seven calmed with her words, but she still clutched at B'Elanna as if the half-Klingon was a life-preserver and she was drowning.</p>
<p>"Perhaps, we both fault our parents for being human," Seven finally murmured from the safety of B'Elanna's bosom.</p>
<p>Exhausted, the ex-drone fell asleep eventually, but B'Elanna couldn't, her thoughts on the last words Seven uttered. B'Elanna was never more vulnerable than when she talked about her father and her childhood, which was rare. Even Tom and Chakotay never managed to persuade her to tell her truest feelings and most hurtful memories, but one urge from Seven, and she had spilled her guts out. In return, the ex-drone revealed her own painful thoughts to her. As B'Elanna reflected on what was said tonight, she came to a decision that she had to put the past behind her and work on a future with Seven. Seven had spoken the truth, that they blamed their parents for mistakes any human being would have made, even if both of them thought those mistakes happened to be foolish. The best thing she and Seven could do now was not to make the same mistakes for themselves and their loved ones.</p>
<p>B'Elanna sighed and pulled the sleeping Borg into a deeper embrace, wanting to cherish the woman's presence in her arms, in her life. Which is why she didn't want to rush jumping into bed with Seven, a mistake she had made before. Especially not after only a little more than a week together, and not for Seven's first sexual experience.</p>
<p>B'Elanna couldn't believe how much time she had wasted in a relationship that didn't go anywhere. She didn't blame Tom, because, in all honesty, she didn't try very hard either to make their commitment fulfilling, emotionally and physically. However, in less than nine days, she had fallen in love with Seven of Nine and developed a much more intimate relationship. Putting off sleeping, B'Elanna considered this as she brushed away the sweat-matted blonde hair from Seven's face, and she realized they both had far more in common than in differences. And their differences seemed more like advantages, complementing each other in some ways. </p>
<p>As the night wore on, even the half-Klingon couldn't keep her eyes open any longer. It was just too comfortable holding the soft, lithe figure of the young woman in her arms.  She cuddled closer, resting her chin on the top of the golden locks, finally falling asleep to the clean, flowery smell, and dreamed of happier memories, many of them revolving around the blue-eyed Borg.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>"Why are we closing the shop earlier than its usual designated time, Dannan?" Ani inquired, as she stood, hands linked behind her back, while she observed the man putting away his instruments hurriedly.</p>
<p>She and B'Elanna had woken early to clean their room and the house, hoping to show their gratitude to Dannan and Moka for allowing them to stay and become part of the household. Now they had completed part of their work at Dannan's workshop by mid-afternoon. </p>
<p>"Today I have to leave early, Ani," replied Dannan, anticipation in his voice. "A group of my friends and acquaintances have a game of Terraball at around this time of the month out in the abandoned airfields. You and Bey are welcome to come along," he invited.</p>
<p>Seven looked at B'Elanna, who had just returned form the back lot after storing away a few repaired droids and caught the end of the conversation. She knew it would be nice for the lieutenant to spend some time with the man. The ex-drone was dressed lightly for a day in the sun anyhow, wearing a long belted, sleeveless, olive tunic and sandals.</p>
<p>"That would be acceptable," she answered. She perceived she had made the right choice when she saw the smile emerge from B'Elanna's lips.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Seven and B'Elanna rested on the artificial turf along the side lines of the field where they watched the game unfold. Two teams of aliens of various species, including a few Rangoons and Nokks, and of varying ages, were playing against each other in a game of Terraball, which, B'Elanna concluded, resembled the old Earth sport, soccer. She had seen a few competitions on Tom's television set, and had recognized the similar rules and player positions. </p>
<p>At least B'Elanna found the patch of grass she had wished for, Seven mused as she leaned up against a large rock that shadowed them from the hot sun that hung high in the sky over the field. B'Elanna sat next to her, cheering Dannan's team on whenever she was not explaining to Seven the finer points of the game. The half-Klingon had pulled off her boots and rolled up her dark colored trousers to relax. A fair number of people were actually watching along the sidelines with them, family members no doubt of the players themselves. Many had infants and children with them, the smaller ones more preoccupied with teasing and chasing each other around rather than paying attention to the game. Not unlike what she and B'Elanna had been doing all along on board Voyager was the funny thought that came to her mind, as she smiled at the sight.</p>
<p>A stray ball was shot out of bounds and rolled over to were B'Elanna and Seven sat. B'Elanna disentangled her legs from Seven's, picked up the animal-skin, stood, and cast it smoothly overhand to one of the forward players, a surprised Norcadian. The Nokks on the playing field smirked.</p>
<p>B'Elanna turned back to rejoin Seven on the grass when she heard, "Do you want to play?"</p>
<p>A fleeting expression of child-like wonder and delight flickered across the half-Klingon's face, but not before Seven caught a glimpse. Seven realized something special had just happened. Dannan jogged over to see what was going on.</p>
<p>Eyes wide like saucers, B'Elanna looked incredulously towards the Norcadian and Dannan. Overcoming her speechlessness, she answered, "I would really like to but I don't want to leave Ani...," gesturing to Seven.</p>
<p>The Borg stood and walked over to B'Elanna. Gazing at her warmly, Seven told her, "Go. I will watch you."</p>
<p>B'Elanna clasped her hand tightly for a brief moment as they grinned at each other, then the lieutenant ran over to pull on her boots, and rolled her pants down before she took her place on the field. Dannan wanted her near him in the forward positions. Seven slowly made her way up the field so she could get a good view of B'Elanna playing, moving between the little children that seemed to take joy in hiding behind her tall legs. She picked up the loose linen shirt that B'Elanna had thrown off, and watched as the Klingon sprinted down the field, sweat already glistening off her bare shoulders, drenching her tank top. Dannan caught her pass, and weaved his way around the opposing team players, controlling the ball with his big feet.</p>
<p>"Fzzzz.......fzzzzzwwwzzzrrrrrtttttttt.....fzzzzeven of Nine."</p>
<p>Shocked, Seven stood frozen, before she recognized what was happening.</p>
<p>"FZZZZZRwwwwwwzzrrrrrrzzzzzzzz. This is Captain Janeway to Lt. Torres, please respond..."</p>
<p>Seven scrambled for the inside of her tunic. Each day she had placed her comm badge on the inside of her clothes, perhaps out of habit, perhaps out of hope, as did B'Elanna. Seven walked away from the small crowd towards a deserted cluster of rocks, and now she stared at the comm badge, not knowing what to do or say. Finally, her years of experience with the Federation crew kicked in and she tapped the comm badge.</p>
<p>-Chirp-</p>
<p>"Seven of Nine here, Captain."</p>
<p>There was a brief pause, before the Captain's throaty answer came through. "Seven, it's good to hear your voice. Are you alright and where is B'Elanna?"</p>
<p>"To answer your first question, Captain, I am doing well. And B'Elanna is currently indisposed as she is participating in a sporting event."  Seven swore she could hear laughing in the background as she waited for a response.</p>
<p>Janeway dipped her head to keep herself from joining her helmsman and Ops officer in a bout of chuckles. Seven was obviously her normal self but oddly, the captain couldn't help but catch her use of Lt. Torres' first name. There must be an interesting story behind it, she considered. Regardless, Janeway just wanted her crewmembers safely back on board her ship and to warp out of this part of space as soon as possible.</p>
<p>"We're ready to beam you both aboard. Please get B'Elanna out of the game," Janeway informed, a hint of amusement in her tone.</p>
<p>Seven took a deep breath and risked asking, "Captain,...the lieutenant and I have unfinished business on the planet. I would like to request that you allow us to stay for one more day so that we may complete our tasks, before we beam aboard."  She added, "We are in no current danger here."</p>
<p>Chakotay glanced curiously at Janeway, who had arched her own brows in wonderment. The rest of the bridge were also amazed, since they assumed that their missing crewmates would have been anxious to return home to Voyager, as much as they were anxious to have them back.</p>
<p>"All right, permission granted, Seven. You have twenty-four hours. Contact us when you are ready to be transported. We'll keep a lock on you both at all times," Janeway replied.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Captain. May I request one more item?.... Could you beam down a holo imager at my coordinates," Seven asked nervously, peering about to make sure she was alone.</p>
<p>Janeway crinkled her brow, but smirk. That was definitely odd for Seven, but she was willing to indulge. Janeway had a lot of questions though, that the Borg had better be able to answer when she did see her.</p>
<p>The captain signed to Harry at Ops, and hailed, "He's sending one down now."</p>

<p>B'Elanna felt the harsh jolts in her joints as her legs pounded the ground hard, running down the middle of the field with the wind she generated whipping her hair behind her. She felt the sweat from the rival player sprinkle on her as she feinted left, then stole away on the right, moving the ball deftly with her feet. Out of the corner of an eye, B'Elanna saw another player approach dead on to meet her with a backup pressing her from behind, so she booted the terraball to the side where Dannan was waiting. Glancing around, she didn't see Seven at the sidelines. That worried the lieutenant as the Borg had a propensity to find trouble. After a few more turns of her head, she found Seven amongst the crowd to her relief, walking back to the sidelines, and waved to the beautiful blonde.</p>
<p>Seven saw B'Elanna wave and returned the gesture. She hid the holo imager behind her back, wrapped within the lieutenant's shirt, not ready to tell B'Elanna that Voyager had found them, and wanting the lieutenant to enjoy her game with Dannan. The communication from Voyager had unsettled her somewhat. Though she had missed her friends and the children, Seven was dreading their eventual departure from the planet which meant saying goodbye to Dannan, Moka, and even Edyn.</p>
<p>-Boink!-</p>
<p>The ball had bounced off the top of the lieutenant's head, and Seven bit her lip to keep from laughing.  She could see the expression on B'Elanna's face even from where she stood, and the half-Klingon looked positively predatory.</p>
<p>"Oy!" yelled the Norcadian running by, as he caught the ball against his chest and transferred it smoothly to his knee, and then to the ground.  "Don't get distracted by the pretty young thing!"</p>
<p>A little miffed, B'Elanna trailed after him as he broke through the line up of opposing players, jostling them out of the way. The lieutenant leaped over another player who had slid forward in an attempt to steal the ball away. The Norcadian lost the terraball when an agile Nokk came up behind him and scoop the it up with his long foot. But the young Nokk wasn't prepared enough as he turned around, when B'Elanna approached him immediately afterwards and stole the ball back right out from under him. The half-Klingon then sped up her sprint, an act born partly out of anger, partly out of sheer excitement. As the distance to the goal dwindled, B'Elanna lobbed the ball high over towards Dannan on the left, but only after drawing the attention of their opponents to herself.</p>
<p>Dannan caught the pass, feinted, pivoted, turned, trying to out maneuver the block, and finally return the lob back to B'Elanna who by then had broken free.  Reacting faster, B'Elanna jumped a head above her opponent, fired a head shot to the right upper corner of the net. As the terraball careened toward the net, the Nokk goalie made one desperate leap to block, but only succeeded in tapping the ball lightly with her fingertips. It was not enough. The ball narrowly missed the pole, and flew into the entangling embrace of the net.</p>
<p>B'Elanna smirked and jogged over to the sidelines, winking at her ex-drone smugly, who could only smile tolerantly and hope the lieutenant would not get overly enthusiastic. There weren't enough healing packs left in the household for both her and Dannan. </p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>The air had cooled considerably as the sun began to dip low behind the rising hills. The game had ended a few minutes ago, with Dannan's team winning, and the crowd of people began to disperse after a round of congratulations had been distributed. The clamor of high pitched voices was also gone as the boisterous children followed their parents home, still unexhausted by the day's afternoon at the park. </p>
<p>The half-Klingon happily strode over to claim her companion who had sat patiently along the grassy turf, watching her play for hours. The young woman stood as B'Elanna approached proudly showing the shiny object in her hand.</p>
<p>"Hey, Ani!" she spoke excitedly, raising the object.  "Look what the opposing team gave me."</p>
<p>Seven gazed at the strange object in curiosity. It seemed like a makeshift, polygon-shaped plaque on a stand, the components most likely a collections of various previously used metal parts, re-worked and shaped.</p>
<p>"What is it?" Seven asked, quirking her brow as she tried to figure out its technological use, a tool perhaps.</p>
<p>"It's a trophy, silly."</p>
<p>"Indeed," Seven murmured, more interested in the fact that B'Elanna was covered with the yellow-orange dirt she was accustomed to seeming everywhere, and which should have spared the field of artificial turf. </p>
<p>Dannan came up behind the small Klingon and clapped her on the back. He seemed to have kept most of the dirt below the waist.</p>
<p>"Great playing out there, Bey," he congratulated. "Oh! I see you got the "Most Annoying Player" trophy from the other team."</p>
<p>Seeing the sheepish, self-deprecating look on B'Elanna's face, he laughed and reassured her. "That's really a compliment, Bey. That means they have to watch out for you the next time you play. In fact, I'd like to have a trophy like that some day. It says you're the best."  He clapped her warmly on the back again.</p>
<p>Smiling once more, she moved closer to Seven, wanting to relax and wrap her arms around the beautiful woman, after the tiring game. Wrinkling her nose, Seven stepped back and raised her hand in front of the soil-clad lieutenant.</p>
<p>"Do not touch me, Bey, until you have had a bath," she said pointedly.</p>
<p>B'Elanna looked down at herself, noticing how dirty and sweaty she had gotten for the first time. When she looked up again, her grin had turned frankly evil, and Seven knew instantly what B'Elanna was plotting.</p>
<p>Slowly, Seven backed away. "Do not come closer in proximity, Bey." she warned, as the half-Klingon stalked her.</p>
<p>"Do not..." she repeated, as she tried to quicken her pace, futilely realizing that she could not outrun the lieutenant in her current state.</p>
<p>"What's a matter, Ani?" B'Elanna asked innocently. "You seemed eager for my embrace last night?"</p>
<p>B'Elanna trailed after the retreating Borg, poking a little fun at Seven's compulsion for cleanliness and order. The Borg glanced over her shoulder at B'Elanna suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Give us a kiss?" B'Elanna begged contritely as she jogged after the Borg.</p>
<p>Dannan shook his head as he watched the two zigzag around the sidelines of the turf. The remaining children turned to watch curiously, their bottles and toys dropped and forgotten, as the two adults seemed to be having a lot of fun playing tag, wondering if they could join in too.</p>
<p>"Go away."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Keep your hands to yourself."</p>
<p>"Come here."</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Seven observed as B'Elanna meandered back to the room, now clean from her bath and dressed in comfortable brown tunic, more interested in polishing her odd object rather than paying attention to where she was going. Grinning, B'Elanna plopped her butt down on the bed as she shined the trophy in her hands with a soft cloth. She was obviously enamored by it, and Seven found that somewhat endearing. However, it did not make the ex-drone's task any easier. Telling the lieutenant that Voyager had finally arrived was proving difficult for the normally blunt Borg. Seven fingered the holo imager that still laid hidden in the lieutenant's shirt, took a deep breath, and rose from her chair. She approached the half-Klingon unnoticed, since B'Elanna did not look up from her activity.</p>
<p>"Bey, I don't see the need for you to polish the object which already has a brilliance," Seven noted.</p>
<p>"Hold on, Ani. I'm almost done, just one little spot...," B'Elanna answered, squinting her eyes as if seeing the tarnish that did not exist.</p>
<p>"Bey, we need to talk," Seven said seriously, though B'Elanna barely noticed as she wiped the shiny surface with the corner of the cloth.</p>
<p>"About what?" the Klingon asked offhandedly.</p>
<p>Seven sighed and removed the holo imager from its wrap, setting it on the bed next to B'Elanna. She waited quietly for B'Elanna to notice. The lieutenant turned her head and gazed at the object for a moment before returning wordlessly back to her trophy, but even from her height, Seven could see the sullen look on B'Elanna's face.</p>
<p>"When?" B'Elanna asked.</p>
<p>Seven frowned, not understanding the question.</p>
<p>"When did Voyager contact us?" B'Elanna repeated.</p>
<p>"Captain Janeway hailed us while you were playing in the game," Seven replied.</p>
<p>B'Elanna snorted, almost in sarcasm.</p>
<p>"We have less than a day left here. We have permission to transport tomorrow," Seven informed.</p>
<p>B'Elanna did not respond and would not even look up at the ex-drone, only studying the trophy now griped in her hand. A dreadful suspicion dawned on Seven.</p>
<p>"You...you are not leaving here?"</p>
<p>The question hung in the air, as the words that left Seven's lips seemed louder than usual. An uneasy silence fell between them like a blank, unending wall.</p>
<p>Finally, B'Elanna lifted her head and her gaze, and looked into the beautiful, unwavering, azure eyes that tore silently at her heartstrings.</p>
<p>Softly, B'Elanna spoke, "I go where you go..."</p>
<p>The lieutenant's response had been murmured so quietly that Seven was not certain she had heard correctly at first. Then, as a tide of relief washed over her, Seven bent down to B'Elanna's waiting lips. Who knew the half-Klingon was such a romantic at heart. Seven lowered herself over B'Elanna and straddled the smaller woman, their kiss never breaking, and delved deeply into B'Elanna's mouth. Lips kissed and hands roamed in new places, discovering what made each woman moan and sigh.</p>
<p>"Bey?" Seven asked with a quirk of her brow, shifting awkwardly as they broke apart for air. "Is that your trophy?"</p>
<p>B'Elanna laughed, a full throaty laugh, all the while pulling the offending object out of the way and placing it on the floor by the bed. Seeing the half-Klingon relax, Seven felt better about having informed B'Elanna of their imminent departure.</p>
<p>Seven kissed B'Elanna one more time before she said gravely, "We must tell Moka and Dannan."</p>
<p>"Yes," B'Elanna replied, gazing up at the Borg as she swept a hand through a blonde ponytail.</p>
<p>"After dinner, you will take Dannan aside, and speak with him," Seven suggested, "while I speak with Moka."</p>
<p>"Okay," B'Elanna agreed, and pressed Seven close, resting their foreheads together. </p>
<p>Once she had made her choice, the half-Klingon would not back away from it, Seven realized. But the ex-drone wondered how much of the decision was somewhat of a sacrifice on B'Elanna's part. It was a question Seven could not answer nor bring herself to ask. All that mattered was that they were going to stay together.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>"Moka?" the Borg called out, as she walked up behind the tiny woman in the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Yes, dear," the elderly Rangoon replied good-naturedly, her hands busy with the preparation of their dessert.</p>
<p>Seven already began to tear uncharacteristically. In a voice which quivered, she said "I must inform you..."</p>
<p>Moka had never heard such depth of emotion in the young woman's voice than at that moment, though there were times when its control had been challenged. As she turned, Moka saw Ani tremble, and opened her arms immediately, into which the young woman fell.</p>
<p>"We must leave you tomorrow," Seven said simply, when she finally calmed, her body limp and spent.</p>
<p>"As all children do, my sweet Ani. They grow and leave the nest," Moka observed, sighing as she wiped away the tears.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>The night sky was so clear that night, as Dannan and B'Elanna loitered out in the front porch on the wide, cooled, marble bench. They had just finished walking Fessi, and had patiently waited for the animal to finish nibbling on the bush just outside the gate, reminiscing on the game they played in the afternoon. Now they sat in amiable silence, watching the stars wink without a cloud in the sky above the hot, dusty, dry planet.</p>
<p>B'Elanna didn't know how to begin telling Dannan she and Seven were leaving tomorrow. She was never any good with good-byes, rarely having the opportunity, it seemed, in her life to have any formal ones. Usually the departures came unexpectedly. B'Elanna looked at his calm profile, trying to memorize the content face for the rest of her life as her heart beat in anguish</p>
<p>"Dannan?" she began. "There's something I have to tell you."</p>
<p>Turning towards the young woman, Dannan encouraged her to continue. "What is it, Bey?"</p>
<p>"Our ship contacted us today."</p>
<p>"Ay...I see," Dannan acknowledged softly. "I guess Abcedi came through for you after all."</p>
<p>"Thank you for letting me and Ani stay with you and Moka for so long. If it hadn't been for the both of you, we wouldn't have survived on this planet," B'Elanna thanked sincerely.</p>
<p>"You're welcome, Bey," Dannan told her warmly, gazing at the young woman he had come to love like family. "But there's no need to thank us. We were happy to have you with us."</p>
<p>Both of them lifted their faces to the stars again, lost in their own thoughts, reining in the emotions that were coming to the surface. There was one more thing for B'Elanna to do, felt compelled to do. </p>
<p>"My real name is B'Elanna Torres. I serve on the Federation Starship Voyager as the Chief of Engineering. My father is Human and my mother is Klingon..."</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>"...which is how we ended up here on this planet. Once we return to Voyager, our crew will try to find a way back to the Alpha Quadrant again," B'Elanna finished, having told him everything.</p>
<p>The half-Klingon sat quietly, waiting for Dannan to absorb all the information she had just revealed. B'Elanna had done so because she felt he deserved to know the entire truth, about who she was at least.</p>
<p>Still a little overwhelmed by what he had heard, Dannan swallowed against the lump in his throat. He wasn't too surprised though. He and Moka had suspected there was more to the women's background than they had originally told them, not out of cold deception, but rather more for necessity.</p>
<p>"That's quite a story...," Dannan remarked, his voice hushed and heavily weighed. "Well, I guess it's B'Elanna then..., ay?"</p>
<p>"Bey," B'Elanna insisted to him, reaching out to cover his large hand with one of hers. "My father used to call me that."</p>
<p>Dannan nodded briefly, turning his hand over to hold onto hers, as they watched the stars for a little while longer until Seven came out to get them. Her eyes seemed slightly puffy, and B'Elanna took that as a sign that she had spoken to Moka as well.</p>
<p>Conversation was subdue around the table as they ate. The taste of the wonderful, warm dessert was somewhat bittersweet that evening, with each individual lost in their own thoughts, unable to give a false sense of high spirits. But it was a meal shared by a family, no matter how brief the union had been. Of course, it wouldn't have been complete without Edyn dropping by for a visit to see his favorite ladies. Though sadden by the news, the junk dealer still kept his humor about him throughout the rest of the night, entertaining them with exaggerated tales of a brave warrior and brilliant lady love that turned rather raunchy and made even the typically thick-skinned half-Klingon blanch and the young Borg confused. Blushing furiously, poor B'Elanna was left to the task of explaining the bawdy details until Seven began flushing herself.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>"Bey, how is that anatomically possible--" Seven asked from the bed.</p>
<p>"Ani, please don't ask anymore about that ending. I have no idea what to tell you. " B'Elanna begged, raising a hand to pause Seven mid-sentence. </p>
<p>Seven closed her mouth, then apologized.</p>
<p>"No, it's alright. I just don't think my face take anymore flushing." </p>
<p>Dressed in her blue sleeping gown, Seven was already tucked into the bed, while the lieutenant stayed up to pack all their items into the survival pack. They didn't have much with them, many of the items they had picked up along the way on the planet donated to the "Poor Junk Dealers Relief Fund," as Edyn put it. The only items they had left were their Star Fleet issue gear, the well-used holo imager, a few clothing items Dannan wanted them to keep, Seven's game box, B'Elanna's prize scroll from the Nokk tournament and her trophy.  B'Elanna studied the object in her hand before setting it on the night table, dimmed the lights, and approached the bed, clothed comfortably for sleep in her maroon sarong. </p>
<p>Seven pulled the covers away to allow B'Elanna to slip into the bed as they settled down to sleep one last time in this room, in this house. The half-Klingon laid on her back, urged by Seven who then proceeded to wrap her arm around the compact woman, resting her head on the soft chest. B'Elanna held Seven close, secretly wishing this would not be the last time she and Seven would share the same bed and sleep in each other's arms through the night. The blond sighed in pleasure while B'Elanna rubbed her shoulders soothingly.</p>
<p>"It is odd that I find myself wanting to lie here in this bed yet I have no desire to sleep. I do not feel tired," Seven noted with trepidation, looking up from where her head rested.</p>
<p>"Yeah, me too. I just want our last moments here to last forever," B'Elanna murmured, cuddling the ex-drone closer.</p>
<p>Seven nuzzled her face up against B'Elanna cheek, needing to feel the intimate connection. Her only reassurance now was that B'Elanna would never leave her, however their collective changed. The loss of Dannan and Moka was going to be painful, but she would be able to live with it, no matter how much she was going to regret it. Being without B'Elanna's presence, however, was unacceptable.</p>
<p>"It is as though I have been here for much longer than nine days. I find myself anticipating our return to Voyager and seeing the Captain, Doctor, Naomi Wildman and the rest of the crew, but I also feel distress when I think about leaving," Seven continued.</p>
<p>"I feel the same way. I'm torn between wanting to stay, and being happy to see everyone on Voyager again as well as my engineering room."  B'Elanna could picture everyone at their posts, their faces with stark clarity, but yet they still seemed so far removed.</p>
<p>"I am...glad to have spent these days here with you, Bey" Seven admitted, propping herself on her elbows so their eyes met. "Our exchange of personal thoughts and information has been invaluable to me. I wish to know more about you."</p>
<p>"What do you want to know?" B'Elanna asked indulgently, smiling at Seven.</p>
<p>"Everything," replied the Borg eagerly, and leaned down to kiss her lightly. "Please tell me about your childhood, your years before Voyager was lost in the Delta Quadrant."</p>
<p>"Only if you tell me about yours," B'Elanna countered.</p>
<p>"My life before Voyager was short-lived," Seven pointed out.</p>
<p>"Mmm...maybe," B'Elanna replied dubiously, "but it sure as hell wasn't boring..."</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Morning came all too quickly for them, though they spent most of the night talking, holding, and kissing each other. The room had been a safe haven for them, bringing them together, spending the most intimate moments here, and discovering love they had never felt before.  Seven took one last lingering look at the room, now in pristine order as if they had never lived there, and walked away. </p>
<p>They decided to leave early that day. Moka and Dannan understood, knowing any delays would prolong the pain of saying goodbye. They sat for one last meal together with Edyn, who, to no one's surprise, showed up near the crack of dawn that morning. Moka packed the rest of the leftovers for the two women to take with them, satisfied with a glance that they looked a bit heavier and healthier than they had been when she first saw them several fateful nights ago. The group stood out in the front enclosure until finally B'Elanna emerged from the house, carrying all their belongs in the sack. </p>
<p>"It's not fair!" Edyn wailed as he grabbed onto Seven, hunched over crying pathetically into her bosom. "My angelic Ani!"</p>
<p>Seven sighed and rolled her eyes, but allowed the man a little latitude, simply because of the affection she had for the oddball alien. Strangely, he had played a pivotal part in helping them contact Voyager. Seven patted him fondly on the head.</p>
<p>"Ahem!" B'Elanna interrupted, tapping on Edyn's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, my beauty," Edyn said to Seven, and quickly gave her a kiss before she could react. Then he turned and pulled the half-Klingon into a bear hug.</p>
<p>"Oofff...," B'Elanna let out as the air was squeezed out of her. </p>
<p>"Goodbye to you, my beloved Beylanna. I shall miss you." Then he gave her a smooch like he did with Seven, and gazed adoringly at her fiery temper that seemed to ignite in her eyes. Suddenly, she chuckled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and hugged him back.</p>
<p>Seven exchanged kisses with Dannan on the cheek, thanked the man quietly and told him she'd miss him and his reassuring presence. He whispered something in her ear before releasing her. She acknowledged it with a nod.</p>
<p>B'Elanna walked over to Moka and enfolded the elderly woman in her strong arms. Moka had told her the night before, "no more thank you's," and B'Elanna kept her word, giving everything she felt in a kiss on the wrinkled cheek.</p>
<p>Moka murmured, "She loves you deeply. I thought you needed to know."</p>
<p>B'Elanna looked at her in shock, then blushed before pulling the woman, who had been like a grandmother to both of them, into another hug. Then Seven walked over to Moka, and covered her face with kisses.</p>
<p>Moka took Seven's face between her weathered hands, and told her gently, "You are a woman now, Ani. And remember, don't think about what happened in the past, focus on the future." She seemed to emphasize the latter part, and Seven promised to remember. At the moment she would have promised the elderly woman anything, as she loved her dearly.</p>
<p>B'Elanna approached Dannan one last time, as they searched each other's faces. Everything had already been said the evening before. Dannan took the young woman into his arms for one more great big hug, kissing her forehead ridges, before she too kissed him goodbye.</p>
<p>Eyes bright with a sheen of unshed tears, the half-Klingon bravely led the still crying Seven by the hand out the front gate, taking one final look at the cherished faces. Wordlessly, they walked to the edge of the settlement to the beam out coordinates, composing themselves before they transported back to Voyager.  The familiar harsh surroundings seemed befitting for the moment. When they reached the rocky destination, the two crewmates gazed at one another and shed their cloaks to reveal their Voyager attire. In the vast desert, upon the hot orange sand, no one noticed the blue shimmering light that claimed the two figures.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Dannan walked through the doorway to his home. The clay walls were bright as the day he painted them. The door was as strong as the day he installed it with his own two hands. The furniture looked almost as new as the day he constructed them. And yet, as he stood in the common room peering about, the house seemed so old and empty to him. A bright reflection on the mantle caught his eye. Slowly he walked over to it, and picked it up. Dannan held onto the trophy and retrieved the pile of images that had laid next to it, laughing and tearing at the same time.</p>
