<p>B'Elanna felt the harsh jolts in her joints as her legs pounded the ground hard, running down the middle of the field with the wind she generated whipping her hair behind her. She felt the sweat from the rival player sprinkle on her as she feinted left, then stole away on the right, moving the ball deftly with her feet. Out of the corner of an eye, B'Elanna saw another player approach dead on to meet her with a backup pressing her from behind, so she booted the terraball to the side where Dannan was waiting. Glancing around, she didn't see Seven at the sidelines. That worried the lieutenant as the Borg had a propensity to find trouble. After a few more turns of her head, she found Seven amongst the crowd to her relief, walking back to the sidelines, and waved to the beautiful blonde.</p>
<p>Seven saw B'Elanna wave and returned the gesture. She hid the holo imager behind her back, wrapped within the lieutenant's shirt, not ready to tell B'Elanna that Voyager had found them, and wanting the lieutenant to enjoy her game with Dannan. The communication from Voyager had unsettled her somewhat. Though she had missed her friends and the children, Seven was dreading their eventual departure from the planet which meant saying goodbye to Dannan, Moka, and even Edyn.</p>
<p>-Boink!-</p>
<p>The ball had bounced off the top of the lieutenant's head, and Seven bit her lip to keep from laughing.  She could see the expression on B'Elanna's face even from where she stood, and the half-Klingon looked positively predatory.</p>
<p>"Oy!" yelled the Norcadian running by, as he caught the ball against his chest and transferred it smoothly to his knee, and then to the ground.  "Don't get distracted by the pretty young thing!"</p>
<p>A little miffed, B'Elanna trailed after him as he broke through the line up of opposing players, jostling them out of the way. The lieutenant leaped over another player who had slid forward in an attempt to steal the ball away. The Norcadian lost the terraball when an agile Nokk came up behind him and scoop the it up with his long foot. But the young Nokk wasn't prepared enough as he turned around, when B'Elanna approached him immediately afterwards and stole the ball back right out from under him. The half-Klingon then sped up her sprint, an act born partly out of anger, partly out of sheer excitement. As the distance to the goal dwindled, B'Elanna lobbed the ball high over towards Dannan on the left, but only after drawing the attention of their opponents to herself.</p>
<p>Dannan caught the pass, feinted, pivoted, turned, trying to out maneuver the block, and finally return the lob back to B'Elanna who by then had broken free.  Reacting faster, B'Elanna jumped a head above her opponent, fired a head shot to the right upper corner of the net. As the terraball careened toward the net, the Nokk goalie made one desperate leap to block, but only succeeded in tapping the ball lightly with her fingertips. It was not enough. The ball narrowly missed the pole, and flew into the entangling embrace of the net.</p>
<p>B'Elanna smirked and jogged over to the sidelines, winking at her ex-drone smugly, who could only smile tolerantly and hope the lieutenant would not get overly enthusiastic. There weren't enough healing packs left in the household for both her and Dannan. </p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>The air had cooled considerably as the sun began to dip low behind the rising hills. The game had ended a few minutes ago, with Dannan's team winning, and the crowd of people began to disperse after a round of congratulations had been distributed. The clamor of high pitched voices was also gone as the boisterous children followed their parents home, still unexhausted by the day's afternoon at the park. </p>
<p>The half-Klingon happily strode over to claim her companion who had sat patiently along the grassy turf, watching her play for hours. The young woman stood as B'Elanna approached proudly showing the shiny object in her hand.</p>
<p>"Hey, Ani!" she spoke excitedly, raising the object.  "Look what the opposing team gave me."</p>
<p>Seven gazed at the strange object in curiosity. It seemed like a makeshift, polygon-shaped plaque on a stand, the components most likely a collections of various previously used metal parts, re-worked and shaped.</p>
<p>"What is it?" Seven asked, quirking her brow as she tried to figure out its technological use, a tool perhaps.</p>
<p>"It's a trophy, silly."</p>
<p>"Indeed," Seven murmured, more interested in the fact that B'Elanna was covered with the yellow-orange dirt she was accustomed to seeming everywhere, and which should have spared the field of artificial turf. </p>
<p>Dannan came up behind the small Klingon and clapped her on the back. He seemed to have kept most of the dirt below the waist.</p>
<p>"Great playing out there, Bey," he congratulated. "Oh! I see you got the "Most Annoying Player" trophy from the other team."</p>
<p>Seeing the sheepish, self-deprecating look on B'Elanna's face, he laughed and reassured her. "That's really a compliment, Bey. That means they have to watch out for you the next time you play. In fact, I'd like to have a trophy like that some day. It says you're the best."  He clapped her warmly on the back again.</p>
<p>Smiling once more, she moved closer to Seven, wanting to relax and wrap her arms around the beautiful woman, after the tiring game. Wrinkling her nose, Seven stepped back and raised her hand in front of the soil-clad lieutenant.</p>
<p>"Do not touch me, Bey, until you have had a bath," she said pointedly.</p>
<p>B'Elanna looked down at herself, noticing how dirty and sweaty she had gotten for the first time. When she looked up again, her grin had turned frankly evil, and Seven knew instantly what B'Elanna was plotting.</p>
<p>Slowly, Seven backed away. "Do not come closer in proximity, Bey." she warned, as the half-Klingon stalked her.</p>
<p>"Do not..." she repeated, as she tried to quicken her pace, futilely realizing that she could not outrun the lieutenant in her current state.</p>
<p>"What's a matter, Ani?" B'Elanna asked innocently. "You seemed eager for my embrace last night?"</p>
<p>B'Elanna trailed after the retreating Borg, poking a little fun at Seven's compulsion for cleanliness and order. The Borg glanced over her shoulder at B'Elanna suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Give us a kiss?" B'Elanna begged contritely as she jogged after the Borg.</p>
<p>Dannan shook his head as he watched the two zigzag around the sidelines of the turf. The remaining children turned to watch curiously, their bottles and toys dropped and forgotten, as the two adults seemed to be having a lot of fun playing tag, wondering if they could join in too.</p>
<p>"Go away."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Keep your hands to yourself."</p>
<p>"Come here."</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Seven observed as B'Elanna meandered back to the room, now clean from her bath and dressed in comfortable brown tunic, more interested in polishing her odd object rather than paying attention to where she was going. Grinning, B'Elanna plopped her butt down on the bed as she shined the trophy in her hands with a soft cloth. She was obviously enamored by it, and Seven found that somewhat endearing. However, it did not make the ex-drone's task any easier. Telling the lieutenant that Voyager had finally arrived was proving difficult for the normally blunt Borg. Seven fingered the holo imager that still laid hidden in the lieutenant's shirt, took a deep breath, and rose from her chair. She approached the half-Klingon unnoticed, since B'Elanna did not look up from her activity.</p>
<p>"Bey, I don't see the need for you to polish the object which already has a brilliance," Seven noted.</p>
<p>"Hold on, Ani. I'm almost done, just one little spot...," B'Elanna answered, squinting her eyes as if seeing the tarnish that did not exist.</p>
<p>"Bey, we need to talk," Seven said seriously, though B'Elanna barely noticed as she wiped the shiny surface with the corner of the cloth.</p>
<p>"About what?" the Klingon asked offhandedly.</p>
<p>Seven sighed and removed the holo imager from its wrap, setting it on the bed next to B'Elanna. She waited quietly for B'Elanna to notice. The lieutenant turned her head and gazed at the object for a moment before returning wordlessly back to her trophy, but even from her height, Seven could see the sullen look on B'Elanna's face.</p>
<p>"When?" B'Elanna asked.</p>
<p>Seven frowned, not understanding the question.</p>
<p>"When did Voyager contact us?" B'Elanna repeated.</p>
<p>"Captain Janeway hailed us while you were playing in the game," Seven replied.</p>
<p>B'Elanna snorted, almost in sarcasm.</p>
<p>"We have less than a day left here. We have permission to transport tomorrow," Seven informed.</p>
<p>B'Elanna did not respond and would not even look up at the ex-drone, only studying the trophy now griped in her hand. A dreadful suspicion dawned on Seven.</p>
<p>"You...you are not leaving here?"</p>
<p>The question hung in the air, as the words that left Seven's lips seemed louder than usual. An uneasy silence fell between them like a blank, unending wall.</p>
<p>Finally, B'Elanna lifted her head and her gaze, and looked into the beautiful, unwavering, azure eyes that tore silently at her heartstrings.</p>
<p>Softly, B'Elanna spoke, "I go where you go..."</p>
<p>The lieutenant's response had been murmured so quietly that Seven was not certain she had heard correctly at first. Then, as a tide of relief washed over her, Seven bent down to B'Elanna's waiting lips. Who knew the half-Klingon was such a romantic at heart. Seven lowered herself over B'Elanna and straddled the smaller woman, their kiss never breaking, and delved deeply into B'Elanna's mouth. Lips kissed and hands roamed in new places, discovering what made each woman moan and sigh.</p>
<p>"Bey?" Seven asked with a quirk of her brow, shifting awkwardly as they broke apart for air. "Is that your trophy?"</p>
<p>B'Elanna laughed, a full throaty laugh, all the while pulling the offending object out of the way and placing it on the floor by the bed. Seeing the half-Klingon relax, Seven felt better about having informed B'Elanna of their imminent departure.</p>
<p>Seven kissed B'Elanna one more time before she said gravely, "We must tell Moka and Dannan."</p>
<p>"Yes," B'Elanna replied, gazing up at the Borg as she swept a hand through a blonde ponytail.</p>
<p>"After dinner, you will take Dannan aside, and speak with him," Seven suggested, "while I speak with Moka."</p>
<p>"Okay," B'Elanna agreed, and pressed Seven close, resting their foreheads together. </p>
<p>Once she had made her choice, the half-Klingon would not back away from it, Seven realized. But the ex-drone wondered how much of the decision was somewhat of a sacrifice on B'Elanna's part. It was a question Seven could not answer nor bring herself to ask. All that mattered was that they were going to stay together.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>"Moka?" the Borg called out, as she walked up behind the tiny woman in the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Yes, dear," the elderly Rangoon replied good-naturedly, her hands busy with the preparation of their dessert.</p>
<p>Seven already began to tear uncharacteristically. In a voice which quivered, she said "I must inform you..."</p>
<p>Moka had never heard such depth of emotion in the young woman's voice than at that moment, though there were times when its control had been challenged. As she turned, Moka saw Ani tremble, and opened her arms immediately, into which the young woman fell.</p>
<p>"We must leave you tomorrow," Seven said simply, when she finally calmed, her body limp and spent.</p>
<p>"As all children do, my sweet Ani. They grow and leave the nest," Moka observed, sighing as she wiped away the tears.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>The night sky was so clear that night, as Dannan and B'Elanna loitered out in the front porch on the wide, cooled, marble bench. They had just finished walking Fessi, and had patiently waited for the animal to finish nibbling on the bush just outside the gate, reminiscing on the game they played in the afternoon. Now they sat in amiable silence, watching the stars wink without a cloud in the sky above the hot, dusty, dry planet.</p>
<p>B'Elanna didn't know how to begin telling Dannan she and Seven were leaving tomorrow. She was never any good with good-byes, rarely having the opportunity, it seemed, in her life to have any formal ones. Usually the departures came unexpectedly. B'Elanna looked at his calm profile, trying to memorize the content face for the rest of her life as her heart beat in anguish</p>
<p>"Dannan?" she began. "There's something I have to tell you."</p>
<p>Turning towards the young woman, Dannan encouraged her to continue. "What is it, Bey?"</p>
<p>"Our ship contacted us today."</p>
<p>"Ay...I see," Dannan acknowledged softly. "I guess Abcedi came through for you after all."</p>
<p>"Thank you for letting me and Ani stay with you and Moka for so long. If it hadn't been for the both of you, we wouldn't have survived on this planet," B'Elanna thanked sincerely.</p>
<p>"You're welcome, Bey," Dannan told her warmly, gazing at the young woman he had come to love like family. "But there's no need to thank us. We were happy to have you with us."</p>
<p>Both of them lifted their faces to the stars again, lost in their own thoughts, reining in the emotions that were coming to the surface. There was one more thing for B'Elanna to do, felt compelled to do. </p>
<p>"My real name is B'Elanna Torres. I serve on the Federation Starship Voyager as the Chief of Engineering. My father is Human and my mother is Klingon..."</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>"...which is how we ended up here on this planet. Once we return to Voyager, our crew will try to find a way back to the Alpha Quadrant again," B'Elanna finished, having told him everything.</p>
<p>The half-Klingon sat quietly, waiting for Dannan to absorb all the information she had just revealed. B'Elanna had done so because she felt he deserved to know the entire truth, about who she was at least.</p>
<p>Still a little overwhelmed by what he had heard, Dannan swallowed against the lump in his throat. He wasn't too surprised though. He and Moka had suspected there was more to the women's background than they had originally told them, not out of cold deception, but rather more for necessity.</p>
<p>"That's quite a story...," Dannan remarked, his voice hushed and heavily weighed. "Well, I guess it's B'Elanna then..., ay?"</p>
<p>"Bey," B'Elanna insisted to him, reaching out to cover his large hand with one of hers. "My father used to call me that."</p>
<p>Dannan nodded briefly, turning his hand over to hold onto hers, as they watched the stars for a little while longer until Seven came out to get them. Her eyes seemed slightly puffy, and B'Elanna took that as a sign that she had spoken to Moka as well.</p>
<p>Conversation was subdue around the table as they ate. The taste of the wonderful, warm dessert was somewhat bittersweet that evening, with each individual lost in their own thoughts, unable to give a false sense of high spirits. But it was a meal shared by a family, no matter how brief the union had been. Of course, it wouldn't have been complete without Edyn dropping by for a visit to see his favorite ladies. Though sadden by the news, the junk dealer still kept his humor about him throughout the rest of the night, entertaining them with exaggerated tales of a brave warrior and brilliant lady love that turned rather raunchy and made even the typically thick-skinned half-Klingon blanch and the young Borg confused. Blushing furiously, poor B'Elanna was left to the task of explaining the bawdy details until Seven began flushing herself.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>"Bey, how is that anatomically possible--" Seven asked from the bed.</p>
<p>"Ani, please don't ask anymore about that ending. I have no idea what to tell you. " B'Elanna begged, raising a hand to pause Seven mid-sentence. </p>
<p>Seven closed her mouth, then apologized.</p>
<p>"No, it's alright. I just don't think my face take anymore flushing." </p>
<p>Dressed in her blue sleeping gown, Seven was already tucked into the bed, while the lieutenant stayed up to pack all their items into the survival pack. They didn't have much with them, many of the items they had picked up along the way on the planet donated to the "Poor Junk Dealers Relief Fund," as Edyn put it. The only items they had left were their Star Fleet issue gear, the well-used holo imager, a few clothing items Dannan wanted them to keep, Seven's game box, B'Elanna's prize scroll from the Nokk tournament and her trophy.  B'Elanna studied the object in her hand before setting it on the night table, dimmed the lights, and approached the bed, clothed comfortably for sleep in her maroon sarong. </p>
<p>Seven pulled the covers away to allow B'Elanna to slip into the bed as they settled down to sleep one last time in this room, in this house. The half-Klingon laid on her back, urged by Seven who then proceeded to wrap her arm around the compact woman, resting her head on the soft chest. B'Elanna held Seven close, secretly wishing this would not be the last time she and Seven would share the same bed and sleep in each other's arms through the night. The blond sighed in pleasure while B'Elanna rubbed her shoulders soothingly.</p>
<p>"It is odd that I find myself wanting to lie here in this bed yet I have no desire to sleep. I do not feel tired," Seven noted with trepidation, looking up from where her head rested.</p>
<p>"Yeah, me too. I just want our last moments here to last forever," B'Elanna murmured, cuddling the ex-drone closer.</p>
<p>Seven nuzzled her face up against B'Elanna cheek, needing to feel the intimate connection. Her only reassurance now was that B'Elanna would never leave her, however their collective changed. The loss of Dannan and Moka was going to be painful, but she would be able to live with it, no matter how much she was going to regret it. Being without B'Elanna's presence, however, was unacceptable.</p>
<p>"It is as though I have been here for much longer than nine days. I find myself anticipating our return to Voyager and seeing the Captain, Doctor, Naomi Wildman and the rest of the crew, but I also feel distress when I think about leaving," Seven continued.</p>
<p>"I feel the same way. I'm torn between wanting to stay, and being happy to see everyone on Voyager again as well as my engineering room."  B'Elanna could picture everyone at their posts, their faces with stark clarity, but yet they still seemed so far removed.</p>
<p>"I am...glad to have spent these days here with you, Bey" Seven admitted, propping herself on her elbows so their eyes met. "Our exchange of personal thoughts and information has been invaluable to me. I wish to know more about you."</p>
<p>"What do you want to know?" B'Elanna asked indulgently, smiling at Seven.</p>
<p>"Everything," replied the Borg eagerly, and leaned down to kiss her lightly. "Please tell me about your childhood, your years before Voyager was lost in the Delta Quadrant."</p>
<p>"Only if you tell me about yours," B'Elanna countered.</p>
<p>"My life before Voyager was short-lived," Seven pointed out.</p>
<p>"Mmm...maybe," B'Elanna replied dubiously, "but it sure as hell wasn't boring..."</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Morning came all too quickly for them, though they spent most of the night talking, holding, and kissing each other. The room had been a safe haven for them, bringing them together, spending the most intimate moments here, and discovering love they had never felt before.  Seven took one last lingering look at the room, now in pristine order as if they had never lived there, and walked away. </p>
<p>They decided to leave early that day. Moka and Dannan understood, knowing any delays would prolong the pain of saying goodbye. They sat for one last meal together with Edyn, who, to no one's surprise, showed up near the crack of dawn that morning. Moka packed the rest of the leftovers for the two women to take with them, satisfied with a glance that they looked a bit heavier and healthier than they had been when she first saw them several fateful nights ago. The group stood out in the front enclosure until finally B'Elanna emerged from the house, carrying all their belongs in the sack. </p>
<p>"It's not fair!" Edyn wailed as he grabbed onto Seven, hunched over crying pathetically into her bosom. "My angelic Ani!"</p>
<p>Seven sighed and rolled her eyes, but allowed the man a little latitude, simply because of the affection she had for the oddball alien. Strangely, he had played a pivotal part in helping them contact Voyager. Seven patted him fondly on the head.</p>
<p>"Ahem!" B'Elanna interrupted, tapping on Edyn's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, my beauty," Edyn said to Seven, and quickly gave her a kiss before she could react. Then he turned and pulled the half-Klingon into a bear hug.</p>
<p>"Oofff...," B'Elanna let out as the air was squeezed out of her. </p>
<p>"Goodbye to you, my beloved Beylanna. I shall miss you." Then he gave her a smooch like he did with Seven, and gazed adoringly at her fiery temper that seemed to ignite in her eyes. Suddenly, she chuckled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  and hugged him back.</p>
<p>Seven exchanged kisses with Dannan on the cheek, thanked the man quietly and told him she'd miss him and his reassuring presence. He whispered something in her ear before releasing her. She acknowledged it with a nod.</p>
<p>B'Elanna walked over to Moka and enfolded the elderly woman in her strong arms. Moka had told her the night before, "no more thank you's," and B'Elanna kept her word, giving everything she felt in a kiss on the wrinkled cheek.</p>
<p>Moka murmured, "She loves you deeply. I thought you needed to know."</p>
<p>B'Elanna looked at her in shock, then blushed before pulling the woman, who had been like a grandmother to both of them, into another hug. Then Seven walked over to Moka, and covered her face with kisses.</p>
<p>Moka took Seven's face between her weathered hands, and told her gently, "You are a woman now, Ani. And remember, don't think about what happened in the past, focus on the future." She seemed to emphasize the latter part, and Seven promised to remember. At the moment she would have promised the elderly woman anything, as she loved her dearly.</p>
<p>B'Elanna approached Dannan one last time, as they searched each other's faces. Everything had already been said the evening before. Dannan took the young woman into his arms for one more great big hug, kissing her forehead ridges, before she too kissed him goodbye.</p>
<p>Eyes bright with a sheen of unshed tears, the half-Klingon bravely led the still crying Seven by the hand out the front gate, taking one final look at the cherished faces. Wordlessly, they walked to the edge of the settlement to the beam out coordinates, composing themselves before they transported back to Voyager.  The familiar harsh surroundings seemed befitting for the moment. When they reached the rocky destination, the two crewmates gazed at one another and shed their cloaks to reveal their Voyager attire. In the vast desert, upon the hot orange sand, no one noticed the blue shimmering light that claimed the two figures.</p>
<p align=center>*****</p>
<p>Dannan walked through the doorway to his home. The clay walls were bright as the day he painted them. The door was as strong as the day he installed it with his own two hands. The furniture looked almost as new as the day he constructed them. And yet, as he stood in the common room peering about, the house seemed so old and empty to him. A bright reflection on the mantle caught his eye. Slowly he walked over to it, and picked it up. Dannan held onto the trophy and retrieved the pile of images that had laid next to it, laughing and tearing at the same time.</p>
