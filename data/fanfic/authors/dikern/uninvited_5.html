<!-- Uninvited \ Section Five -->

<P>Rosa moved her chair next to the queen and spoke cautiously. "Catherine, I
  know this is hard on you. I&#146;m so sorry this has happened. I understand
  what it feels like to worry about your child, but if anyone can protect her
  and bring her back safely, it&#146;s my Maria."</P>
<P>"She&#146;s just an innocent young woman," Catherine said as she sniffed back
  tears and looked over at Rosa. "She doesn&#146;t deserve to be caught up in
  the struggle between our two countries. She never even wanted to come to Spain,
  but the King insisted. She&#146;s my youngest daughter and I love her so much."</P>
<P>"Have faith, Catherine," Rosa said. "Luc and Maria won&#146;t let anything
  happen to her. They both care deeply for your daughter."</P>
<P>She looked down at her hands and thought about her next words. The events of
  the morning weighed heavily on her mind. It didn&#146;t help matters that her
  only son had vanished, and now Maria was risking her life for a woman who Rosa
  was certain had caused the dispute between brother and sister. </P>
<P>"Catherine," she said very slowly. "Has Danielle said anything to you about
  Fredrick? I mean has she shown any interest in their courtship?"</P>
<P>Catherine sighed. She knew in her heart that Danielle, while keeping her promise
  to be polite and attentive to Fredrick, was not overly excited by this marriage.
  In fact, Catherine noticed that her child seemed much more interested in Maria
  than anyone else. She&#146;d never seen Danielle look at anyone the way she
  looked at her. It worried her terribly, but she didn&#146;t know what to say
  to Danielle. She&#146;d tried to ignore it, but it was obvious from Danielle&#146;s
  display at dinner that her attraction was to Rosa&#146;s beautiful daughter
  and not to Fredrick. </P>
<P>"Why do you ask such a question at a time like this?" Catherine asked. She
  couldn&#146;t believe that Rosa thought it was an appropriate time to get into
  a conversation she really didn&#146;t want to have. All she could think about
  was Danielle&#146;s safe return.</P>
<P>"I&#146;m sorry, Catherine," Rosa said "I&#146;m just as worried as you are
  at this moment, but we need to talk about something. This won&#146;t be easy,
  but I don&#146;t think it can wait any longer."</P>
<P>Rosa stood up and walked to the window. Peering out, she took a deep breath.
  She was sure that Maria cared for Danielle. The look on Maria&#146;s face as
  she rode after Ortega was one of concern for someone that she loved, not just
  worry over a French princess.</P>
<P>"Before you were up this morning, something happened between Maria and Fredrick.
  I&#146;ve never seen my children argue, but this was a bitter fight," Rosa said,
  turning her attention to Catherine and walking over to her. "I think Danielle
  is at the heart of it."</P>
<P>Catherine looked up at Rosa. "What are you talking about? What happened?"</P>
<P>"I found the three of them in the garden early this morning. I only caught
  the last part of it, but it ended in Fredrick accidentally injuring Cora. He
  pulled his sword on Maria and Cora tried to protect her," Rosa trembled slightly
  with the memory of the morning. "Fredrick got on his horse and left immediately.
  I tried to get answers, but no one would talk. Danielle was crying uncontrollably
  and the tension between her and Maria was not normal."</P>
<P>"What are you trying to tell me, Rosa?" Catherine stood up from her chair so
  that she was eye to eye with Rosa. </P>
<P>"I think . . ." Rosa whispered. "I think that Danielle and Maria care for one
  another and I&#146;m afraid that Fredrick saw something between them."</P>
<P>Catherine&#146;s breath caught in her chest and she stumbled back, falling
  into her chair. Rosa came to her side.</P>
<P>"Catherine? Are you all right, Catherine?"</P>
<P>Catherine put her head in her hands as her tears fell hard. She couldn&#146;t
  explain the emotion she felt. Concern, fear, confusion, and worry all piled
  up on her, causing her to break down and weep.</P>
<P>"Catherine," Rosa sat next to the queen and placed her hand on her knee. "We
  don&#146;t need to talk about this right now. Please forgive me. I&#146;ve just
  been so concerned about this. It feels like my family is falling apart and I
  just needed someone to talk to about it. I thought we could work this out together."
  She looked down and felt her eyes welling with tears. Soon, her sobs were as
  strong as Catherine&#146;s.</P>
<P>Slowly, Catherine covered the Spanish woman&#146;s hand with her own. She knew
  in her heart that Rosa was probably correct in her assumption about Maria and
  her daughter. She wasn&#146;t sure what to say. </P>
<P>"This is such a mess," Catherine sighed. "I never imagined any of this could
  happen."</P>
<P>"God help us, none of this was planned," Rosa said, choking back sobs</P>
<P>The women looked up at each other, worry and concern evident in their tear-soaked
  eyes.</P>
<P>&#145;What are we going to do, Rosa?" Catherine asked quietly.</P>
<P>"We&#146; re going to pray for the safe return of our children," Rosa said.
  "And whatever comes of all of this, we&#146;re going to help each other through
  it."</P>
<P>Catherine squeezed Rosa&#146;s hand, taking comfort in her words and strength.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The sun had left the sky and only the moon&#146;s soft light illuminated the
  grounds as Luc&#146;s horse came to an abrupt stop in front of the doctor&#146;s
  villa. Jumping down quickly, he ran to the door and pounded as hard as he could.
</P>
<P>"We need some assistance here, please," Luc shouted. </P>
<P>He ran back to Danielle. "Let me take her, Princess," he said, gently cradling
  Maria in his arms.</P>
<P>"Be careful, Luc," Danielle said. "She&#146;s so weak." She dismounted and
  ran ahead of Luc. </P>
<P>The door to the villa opened and Dr. Sanar stepped out holding a lamp to light
  the dark entrance. "What&#146;s happened here?" </P>
<P>"Maria&#146;s been shot," Danielle said, reaching in and pushing the door wider
  so that Luc could carry the wounded woman inside. "Ortega and his men kidnapped
  me and as Luc and Maria were rescuing me, she got injured."</P>
<P>"Take her upstairs and put her in the room on the right," Dr. Sanar instructed.</P>
<P>Luc climbed the steps carrying Maria as Danielle followed closely behind. Placing
  her gingerly on the bed, Luc stepped back. Danielle went to her side, kneeling
  on the floor.</P>
<P>"You&#146;re going to be okay, Maria," she said, picking up the tall woman&#146;s
  hand and holding it against her own warm cheek. She placed her hand over Maria&#146;s
  and, sliding it down gently to her lips, kissed the other woman&#146;s palm
  lightly. She held Maria&#146;s hand a moment longer, afraid to relinquish the
  touch. "You hang on. You hear me? I&#146;ll be right here waiting for you."</P>
<P>"I&#146;ll have to ask you to step out," Dr. Sanar said, holding the lamp by
  Maria&#146;s side. "I need to see how bad this wound is."</P>
<P>Danielle&#146;s eyes began to tear up. She kissed Maria&#146;s palm again and
  then gently laid her hand back on the bed.</P>
<P>"Come on, Princess," Luc said softly. "Let&#146;s let the doctor take care
  of her."</P>
<P>Luc brought his hand down and helped Danielle up from the floor. The young
  woman stood on wobbly feet and held on to the strong arm of the captain for
  support. He led her out of the room and down the stairs.</P>
<P>"Let me take you back to your mother," Luc offered. "I&#146;m sure she&#146;s
  worried out of her wits by now."</P>
<P>"No, Luc," Danielle said. "I can&#146;t leave Maria. I won&#146;t go anywhere
  until I know she&#146;s out of danger."</P>
<P>"Princess," Luc said, placing his hand on her cheek and wiping away dried blood
  from one of the many scratches caused by the tree branches, "Your wounds need
  to be tended to and you need to rest from this ordeal."</P>
<P>"I&#146;m fine, Luc," Danielle said impatiently. "These are just little cuts
  and I can&#146;t rest until I know she&#146;s all right!"</P>
<P>Danielle realized that she&#146;d snapped at the captain. She took a deep breath.
  "Luc, I&#146;m sorry. I didn&#146;t mean to take that tone with you. I&#146;ll
  never be able to tell you how grateful I am to you for risking your life to
  save me and for helping Maria, but I can&#146;t leave."</P>
<P>Danielle looked at Luc; he was not just the Captain of the Guard, but her friend.
  She took his hand and led him to the sitting room, then sat in a chair next
  to the window.</P>
<P>"Sit down, Luc," Danielle said softly. "I need to tell you something."</P>
<P>Luc sat directly across from the young woman and looked at her with compassion.
</P>
<P>"Luc," Danielle began. "I don&#146;t know how to tell you this. I&#146;ve tried
  to put it in words for myself many times but none of the explanations compare
  to what it is I feel inside. For years now I&#146;ve dreamt of the same blue
  eyes. I prayed to find this person and it happened, Luc. It&#146;s not what
  I expected but I can&#146;t deny what my heart knows is the truth. I . . . I&#146;m
  . . ."</P>
<P>"You&#146;re in love with Maria," Luc said thoughtfully.</P>
<P>Danielle looked over at the man who had been her protector and mentor since
  her birth and smiled slightly at him. </P>
<P>"How did you know?"</P>
<P>"I see it in your eyes, in your words, and in your actions, Danielle," Luc
  said quietly. "I watched you risk your life for her today and her for you. I
  knew this morning that Maria cared for you deeply, but what I didn&#146;t know
  was if you felt the same for her. I do now."</P>
<P>"Does that upset you, Luc?" Danielle asked hesitantly.</P>
<P>"No, cherie," Luc said, taking her small hand in his and smiling gently. "Your
  life has always been controlled by your title. I prayed that you would find
  the happiness you deserved. Some people never know what it feels like to find
  their true love. That you have makes me very happy."</P>
<P>Danielle brought his hand up to her lips and kissed the back of it as tears
  began to fall from her eyes. "Thank you, Luc. Your friendship has been the greatest
  of my life. Your understanding and support mean the world to me."</P>
<P>"You will always have that from me, Princess, but most people will not be as
  accepting of this. Does anyone else know of your feelings?" Luc asked gently,
  standing up from his chair.</P>
<P>"Oh, Luc," her voice shook slightly. "This morning, in the garden, very early,
  I went down to talk to Maria. I told her about my feelings and she begged me
  to drop it. She was worried about her brother, my position in France, and doing
  the right thing. She told me we had to walk away from it, but I pushed her and
  pushed her until she broke down and she kissed me."</P>
<P>Danielle took a deep breath and continued. "Fredrick witnessed the kiss and
  blamed Maria for seducing me. That&#146;s not at all what happened, but he wouldn&#146;t
  listen. He attacked her and that&#146;s how Cora got injured. It was horrible.
  None of this was Maria&#146;s fault. I should have walked away like she begged
  me to do."</P>
<P>Danielle looked up at her friend. The worry in his eyes showed through his
  usual stoic demeanor.</P>
<P>"Where is Fredrick now?" Luc asked, concerned.</P>
<P>"I&#146;m not sure, Luc," Danielle said softly, looking down at her lap and
  letting fall tears born of worry and frustration. "He got on his horse right
  after the incident and left. I saw his face when he was leaving. I think it
  scared him that he&#146;d lost control. He didn&#146;t mean to hurt Cora. It
  was an accident."</P>
<P>Luc came back to Danielle and knelt in front of her. "Don&#146;t worry about
  any of this right now, Princess. We&#146;ll figure something out."</P>
<P>"I hope so, Luc. This is such a mess and now Maria . . ." her voice broke off
  as her tears turned to soft sobs.</P>
<P>"You stay with her," Luc said, standing up. "I need to go back and let the
  queen know you&#146;re okay. Rosa needs to know about Maria, and I&#146;ll do
  my best to find Fredrick and talk with him."</P>
<P>"Thank you, Luc," Danielle said and stood to embrace him.</P>
<P>"I&#146;ll return as soon as possible," Luc placed a kiss on the top of her
  head.</P>
<P>Danielle watched from the door as he mounted his horse and rode away. Turning
  around, she closed the door and walked back up the steps; sitting on the top
  rung, she prayed as she waited for the door to open.</P>
<P>Fredrick led his horse up a dirt road. He&#146;d spent the entire day riding
  through the countryside and thinking about his actions of the morning. He was
  embarrassed by his sister and ashamed of his own behavior. He&#146;d never meant
  to let his anger get the best of him and no matter what Maria had done, it could
  not excuse the outburst that led to Cora being hurt. He couldn&#146;t believe
  he&#146;d tried to hurt his sister. The guilt was eating away at him. </P>
<P>Deciding to go back to the doctor&#146;s villa and check on Cora, he pulled
  the reins hard to the right and headed south. As he rode, he remembered the
  green eyes of the princess as they looked at him in contempt. She would never
  trust him again. Any hope that she would still want his hand in marriage was
  lost. His thoughts drifted to his mother, who would be devastated by the turn
  of events. He took a deep breath and dropped his head.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Danielle looked up when the door opened. The doctor walked out, wiping his
  hands on a cloth stained by Maria&#146;s blood. </P>
<P>"How is she?" Danielle asked anxiously, standing up to talk to him.</P>
<P>"She lost a lot of blood. I removed the musket ball, but it punctured her left
  lung. It&#146;ll be hard for her to fight off infection in the weakened state
  she&#146;s in," Doctor Sanar said in a low voice. "Only time will tell. Has
  someone told Rosa?"</P>
<P>"Luc&#146;s gone back to tell her," Danielle said, walking over to the room
  and peering in at Maria. "May I sit with her, please?" </P>
<P>"I think I should look at your cuts first, and get you cleaned up," Doctor
  Sanar said. "She won&#146;t be conscious anytime soon."</P>
<P>"Later, I promise, I . . . I need to be with her now," Danielle insisted.</P>
<P>The doctor nodded his head in reply. Danielle walked quickly to the bed, leaving
  the door open. Maria&#146;s face was pale and beads of perspiration rose on
  her forehead. A clean sheet covered her chest. </P>
<P>Danielle looked down at her own hands. Walking over to a water basin, she washed
  the dirt and blood from them and then got a clean rag, soaking it in another
  basin filled with cool clean water. Wringing the rag out, she brought a chair
  to the edge of the bed and sat down. Gently, she wiped Maria&#146;s cheeks and
  laid the cloth over her forehead. She sat quietly, looking at the beautiful
  face, praying for her recovery.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Fredrick dismounted his horse and knocked on the doctor&#146;s door. </P>
<P>The door opened and Doctor Sanar stepped out. "She&#146;s upstairs in the room
  on the right"</P>
<P>"Cora?"</P>
<P>"No. Maria!" the doctor said, puzzled that Fredrick would inquire after the
  dog first. "The princess is with her."</P>
<P>Fredrick blinked his eyes. "What? Why is Maria here?"</P>
<P>"I take it you&#146;ve not been back to the villa today?" Doctor Sanar said
  slowly. </P>
<P>Fredrick shook his head. </P>
<P>"After I treated Cora, it seems that Ortega and his bandits kidnapped the princess.
  The French captain and your sister went after them and in the process of rescuing
  the princess, Maria was shot."</P>
<P>"And the princess? Is she all right?" Fredrick asked urgently.</P>
<P>"Minor scrapes and bruises from what I can tell, but she won&#146;t leave Maria&#146;s
  side," the doctor replied.</P>
<P>Confused and alarmed, Fredrick walked past the doctor through the entrance
  and up the stairs. When he got to the door, he stopped before turning to enter
  the room, listening as he heard Danielle&#146;s voice.</P>
<P>"I&#146;m so sorry, Maria," Danielle said, picking up Maria&#146;s hand and
  holding it tenderly between hers. "I&#146;ve done nothing but ruin your life
  since I arrived. I never intended for any of this to happen. I know you&#146;ll
  never be able to forgive me, but I&#146;ll live the rest of my life trying to
  set things right with you and your family."</P>
<P>Danielle brought the tall woman&#146;s hand to her lips and placed small kisses
  on it. "You begged me to leave you alone and I just couldn&#146;t do it. I tried
  to fight the feelings I had for you, I really did, but I wasn&#146;t as strong
  as you are. Can you blame me for wanting to make my dream a reality? I finally
  found what my heart was searching for and I wanted to force you to see that
  we were destined to be together. I didn&#146;t care at what cost and now look
  what&#146;s happened."</P>
<P>Danielle looked at Maria with tears of regret. "Oh God, Maria, please forgive
  me. If I had let you leave when you wanted to, Fredrick would have never blamed
  you for our kiss. This is all my fault!" Danielle laid her head on the side
  of the bed next to Maria. "My heart will always belong to you, my love, and
  I&#146;ll do whatever you think is best from now on. If you want me to marry
  Fredrick, I will, I promise you, just please come back to me. You have to fight,
  Maria. I couldn&#146;t go on without you. I love you, Maria."</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Fredrick felt his legs weaken as he leaned against the wall for support. All
  along he&#146;d blamed his sister for seducing the princess, when it was Danielle
  who taken the initiative. He closed his eyes tight and shook his head. Maria
  had always thought of his feelings first and the family. Why hadn&#146;t he
  trusted her to do the same when it came to the princess? </P>
<P>He bit his lip, holding back the anger he felt at himself for thinking that
  his sister would ever intentionally do anything to hurt him or shame their family.
  He&#146;d let his jealousy and pride come before the love of his sister and
  it made him sick as he remembered the horrible things he&#146;d yelled at her.
  Not only had he caused Maria pain with his words, he&#146;d left her alone to
  fight against Ortega. He felt like her blood was on his hands. </P>
<P>&#145;I should have been there for you, Maria, just like you have always been
  for me.&#146; He thought as he quietly walked away and headed down the stairs.
  &#145;I don&#146;t know if I can ever forgive myself.&#146;</P>
<P>"Doctor?" Fredrick asked softly as he reached the bottom of the stairs. "Will
  she be all right?"</P>
<P>"I won&#146;t lie to you," Doctor Sanar said. "It&#146;s serious. The bullet
  punctured her lung and she&#146;s lost a lot of blood. Only time will tell."</P>
<P>Fredrick walked out the door to his horse. He knew he needed to be with his
  mother. She deserved the truth and she needed to know about Maria. He promised
  himself that his petty pride would never get in the way of the truth again.
  Somehow, some way, he needed to make this right.</P>
<P>Keeping her promise to Maria, Rosa left Catherine briefly to go check on Cora.
  As she sat inside the stables petting the healing dog, she heard a lone horse
  come to a stop outside. Holding her breath, she watched as the captain walked
  in and guided his horse to the water trough. Her heart fell as she braced herself
  against the stall.</P>
<P>"Maria?" Rosa asked breathless.</P>
<P>Luc looked up and saw Rosa. Walking quickly to her, he pulled a stool over
  for the woman, who was obviously having trouble standing. </P>
<P>"There is no easy way to tell you this . . . Maria&#146;s been shot," Luc held
  onto Rosa&#146;s hand as he helped her sit. "She&#146;s with the doctor. He&#146;s
  doing everything he can for her."</P>
<P>"What happened?" Rosa inquired through her tears and then quickly thought of
  the princess. "And Danielle?"</P>
<P>"She&#146;s fine, but she insisted on staying with your daughter," Luc said,
  holding Rosa&#146;s hand and kneeling down to talk to her. "Maria found Ortega&#146;s
  hiding place and we were able to free Danielle, but as we were escaping, one
  of Ortega&#146;s armed men surprised us. I yelled to Maria and she shielded
  Danielle from the attack. The bullet would have hit the princess, but Maria
  saved her life."</P>
<P>"I must go to her," Rosa struggled with the words. "I . . . I need to be with
  my daughter."</P>
<P>"Of course," Luc said. "I will take you there myself. First I must tell Catherine
  that Danielle has been found and is unharmed. Will you be all right for a moment?"</P>
<P>Rosa shook her head as her tears fell harder. "Catherine is sitting just inside
  the villa."</P>
<P>"I&#146;ll be right back and we&#146;ll get to Maria as quickly as possible."
  Luc ran out of the stables.</P>
<P>"My Maria," Rosa cried hard into her hands as she prayed. "You&#146;ve always
  been the brave one in the family. I don&#146;t know what I would do without
  you, my beautiful daughter. Your strength has been the one thing that has held
  our family together. I would have fallen apart when your father was murdered,
  but you were there to encourage me to keep living. Hear me now, my child. I
  love you more than life itself. You fight for me, Maria. Dear God, please be
  with her now."</P>
<P>Fredrick heard his mother&#146;s prayer as he walked quietly into the stables.
  "Mother?"</P>
<P>Rosa looked up. "Oh, Fredrick," she stood and walked quickly to her son, throwing
  her arms around his neck. "Where have you been? I&#146;ve been so worried. My
  God, Fredrick, so much has happened."</P>
<P>"Mother," Fredrick hugged her tight. "I know what&#146;s happened today and
  to Maria. I&#146;ve just come from Dr. Sanar&#146;s villa. She&#146;s in good
  hands. Danielle is with her, but it is serious." </P>
<P>Pulling back from the embrace, he brought his hands up to his mother&#146;s
  cheeks. "I can&#146;t explain what happened this morning, except to say, I acted
  like a complete idiot. I&#146;ve been roaming the countryside all day trying
  to understand how I could have lost control. I&#146;m sorry I hurt you."</P>
<P>Stepping back he looked over and saw Cora lying on a blanket. "How&#146;s Maria&#146;s
  little pet?" </P>
<P>"She&#146;ll be fine, Fredrick," Rosa sniffed back her tears. </P>
<P>"I&#146;m so glad. She loves that dog. I didn&#146;t mean to harm her." Fredrick
  said softly.</P>
<P>"Please tell me what made you and your sister fight. I really need to understand
  this." Rosa said.</P>
<P>"It&#146;s complicated, Mother," Fredrick brought his hands to his sides. "Sometimes
  things are better left unspoken."</P>
<P>Rosa looked down lost in her own thoughts. She knew what Fredrick was referring
  to. She&#146;d watched her daughter&#146;s interactions with other women for
  some years now. It was obvious to her that Maria preferred the company of women.
  At first it was hard for her to come to terms with. Maria had never had a serious
  involvement with anyone and the subject was never addressed in the family, until
  now.</P>
<P>"Fredrick," Rosa said, looking up. "I already have an idea, but I&#146;d rather
  hear it from you. I want no more secrets in this family. We need to come together
  now."</P>
<P>Fredrick lowered his head. "I accused Maria of seducing the princess. I walked
  into the garden this morning and saw them in an embrace. I felt ashamed that
  Maria would embarrass our family in that way and I guess I also felt a little
  jealous." Fredrick looked up slowly. "I assumed that Maria had forced Danielle
  into the kiss. I didn&#146;t even consider that the princess could have initiated
  it."</P>
<P>"And now you think differently?" Rosa reached over and placed her hand over
  her son&#146;s.</P>
<P>" I overheard Danielle confess it as she was praying for Maria," Fredrick squeezed
  his mother&#146;s hand. "I don&#146;t think Maria wanted to pursue the feelings.
  In fact, she was planning on leaving just to avoid them. Danielle was pushing
  Maria to acknowledge their bond."</P>
<P>"Oh, Fredrick," Rosa sighed. "I&#146;ve noticed emotions that seemed strained
  coming from both of them. I wondered if what I was seeing had anything to do
  with an attraction between them."</P>
<P>"Mother," Fredrick said slowly. "Danielle is in love with Maria. If you could
  have heard the words she spoke - they left no doubt about her feelings."</P>
<P>Lost in a reflective silence, Fredrick dropped his head, and then after a moment
  walked over to look at Cora. "I don&#146;t think Maria will ever forgive me.
  I&#146;ve hurt her so badly. The things I said, and the worst of it is - I really
  had intended in my rage to hurt her. It&#146;s unthinkable and unforgivable."</P>
<P>"Maria loves you, Fredrick," Rosa said. "If you explain it to her as you have
  to me, she will forgive you. She would never do anything to intentionally hurt
  you." </P>
<P>"I&#146;ll never forget that again," Fredrick said.</P>
<P>Fredrick walked back to his mother. "I like Danielle, Mother. I felt an attraction
  to her and I hoped that our marriage would not be just one of convenience. I
  started to hope for much more. I told Maria that I liked the princess. I can
  only imagine the pain she felt - I really do think Maria would have walked away
  from her only chance at a real love just for the sake of my happiness."</P>
<P>"I have no doubt that she would have tried," Rosa said. "She loves you that
  much."</P>
<P>Fredrick reached for his mother&#146;s hand and held it tightly. "We both know
  Maria, Mother. That she struggled with her feelings and finally gave in to a
  kiss tells me that the love between them is stronger than Maria&#146;s willpower.
  I won&#146;t let her walk away from that. She&#146;s been given a gift of love
  from an amazing young woman. If I can do anything to support that, I will."
</P>
<P>Rosa stood on her tiptoes and placed a kiss on her son&#146;s cheek. "I&#146;m
  very proud of you, Fredrick. It takes a special quality in a man to admit his
  mistakes and strength of character to show the depth of understanding you have
  for your sister. You know, of course, that Danielle&#146;s life is governed
  by her title," Rosa squeezed Frederick&#146;s hand. "We do not have the only
  say in this woman&#146;s future." </P>
<P>"I know, but I have a plan that just might work out for everyone," Fredrick
  said. "But first we must go to Maria. She needs you."</P>
<P>"She needs both of us," Rosa said.</P>
<P>Luc and Catherine walked into the stables, stopping immediately when they saw
  Fredrick.</P>
<P>"Luc," Fredrick said, walking to the captain and holding his hand out. "I&#146;ll
  never be able to repay you for helping my sister against Ortega. I am only sorry
  I was not there to help you. Thank you for getting Maria to the doctor and for
  being here for my mother."</P>
<P>"No thank you is necessary," the captain said, shaking Frederick&#146;s hand.
  "I wish I could have prevented your sister from being harmed. I pray for her
  full recovery."</P>
<P>"She saved my daughter&#146;s life," Catherine said softly. "She&#146;s a very
  brave woman. You must be very proud of your sister."</P>
<P>"I&#146;ve never been more proud in my life," Fredrick said.</P>
<P>Catherine looked over at Rosa. Rosa gave her a small smile as a tear fell from
  her eye. Catherine returned the smile. It appeared that mother and son had resolved
  the events of the morning.</P>
<P>"Shall we go?" Luc asked</P>
<P>"Yes, immediately," Fredrick replied.</P>
<P>Luc and Fredrick readied the coach and helped Rosa and Catherine inside, then
  Luc mounted his horse and Fredrick climbed onto the steps of the coach. Just
  before he sat down, he thought of something, jumped off of the steps, and ran
  back inside the stables. Luc watched, curious at Frederick&#146;s last-minute
  action. In a moment, Fredrick reappeared, carrying a bundle wrapped in a blanket.
  He opened the door to the carriage.</P>
<P>"Maria would want to know that Cora&#146;s with her," Fredrick said, placing
  the dog between his mother and the queen. "I think she would take comfort in
  knowing that her pet was nearby."</P>
<P>"Yes, of course," Rosa said. "I&#146;m surprised I didn&#146;t think of it.
  Thank you, Fredrick."</P>
<P>The door closed quietly. Catherine looked over at Rosa as she placed her hand
  on Cora&#146;s head and petted the animal. "He&#146;s a thoughtful young man,
  Rosa. Whatever happened before, it appears he&#146;s worked through it. You
  did a wonderful job raising him. You must be proud of both of your children."</P>
<P>"I am, Catherine," Rosa said as she watched the dog&#146;s tail wag in response
  to the petting. "You have no idea how much."</P>
<P>"Rosa," Catherine asked very slowly. "Did Fredrick tell you what happened?"</P>
<P>"Yes, my friend," Rosa said, placing her hand over the queen&#146;s. "It is
  as we suspected. Our daughters are struggling with the feelings they have for
  each other. Fredrick has come to terms with it, but I&#146;m not sure what we&#146;ll
  do about this situation."</P>
<P>"I guess we&#146;ll deal with it as we need to," Catherine said, looking over
  at her friend. "The most important thing right now is Maria. I&#146;m praying
  for her."</P>
<P>"Thank you," Rosa said, squeezing the hand of the woman she&#146;d had grown
  to care about. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Danielle removed the cloth from Maria&#146;s forehead and dipped it back into
  the cool water. With the back of her hand, she felt the sides of Maria&#146;s
  face. Despite her attempts to cool her skin, it seemed that her temperature
  was increasing. Looking at the tall woman, she saw a rapid fluttering underneath
  closed eyelids. Maria&#146;s lips began to twitch and her shoulders and chest
  began to tremble. A soft moan escaped her mouth. Danielle wasn&#146;t sure if
  it was the fever or the pain that was causing this reaction.</P>
<P>"Maria," Danielle said, kissing the woman&#146;s cheek, "It&#146;s okay, Maria.
  I&#146;m with you. You&#146;re going to be fine. Do you hear me, Maria? I&#146;m
  right here, my love. I won&#146;t leave your side. I&#146;ll be with you always,
  Maria."</P>
<P>Maria&#146;s movements stilled as Danielle continued to speak softly to her.
  Danielle laid her head next to the dark woman, humming a song into her ear.
  Each time she began to moan or tremble, the princess talked her through the
  spell and whispered songs until Maria calmed. Danielle kept track of the occurrences
  and it worried her that they were coming closer and closer together. </P>
<P>Dr. Sanar came up to check on his patient and found the princess humming a
  song. "Is she responsive?"</P>
<P>"No," Danielle said worriedly. "She&#146;s having tremors of some sort. They
  began a while ago and her fever seems worse."</P>
<P>"Let me take a look." The doctor moved next to the injured woman and felt her
  face, then removed the sheet and listened to her lungs. "She&#146;s not doing
  as well as I&#146;d hoped. I think she might be fighting an infection. Just
  in case, we&#146;ll have to bleed her to let the infection drain."</P>
<P>"But she&#146;s so weak already," Danielle said. "Won&#146;t that make it harder
  for her to recover?"</P>
<P>"If it is an infection we shouldn&#146;t wait." The doctor moved to the table
  and brought over a porcelain bowl, placing a towel underneath it, then reached
  for a knife. He placed Maria&#146;s arm over the bowl, resting her elbow in
  the center. "You might want to leave now."</P>
<P>"No, I&#146;m staying," Danielle said softly. </P>
<P>"Very well," Dr. Sanar said before he took the blade and made a cut along the
  soft fold of Maria&#146;s arm. Blood trickled out immediately and collected
  in the basin.</P>
<P>"Is there anything else we can do?" Danielle asked as tears formed in her eyes.</P>
<P>"I&#146;m sorry, but I&#146;ve done all that I know how to do," the doctor
  stood and started to walk out of the room. "I&#146;ll be back in a couple of
  minutes."</P>
<P>Danielle watched as Maria lay helpless, taken to a dark world by the infection.
  Her head moved back and forth and she mumbled words that made no sense. The
  perspiration on her brow beaded with intensity and as Danielle ran her hand
  alongside of Maria&#146;s arm, her fingers burned from the heat coming from
  her skin. Gently holding Maria&#146;s hand, she hummed another song and prayed
  for her to return from her hallucinations.</P>
<P>The doctor returned a few minutes later and removed the bowl. He tied a bandage
  around the cut and folded Maria&#146;s arm back to help stop the bleeding. "We&#146;ll
  see how she does now, but we may need to repeat this treatment. If you notice
  any change in her, call for me. I&#146;ll be right downstairs."</P>
<P>"Thank you, Doctor," Danielle whispered.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>As the doctor stepped off of the stairs, he heard a knock. Taking the lamp
  from the side table, he opened the door. Rosa quickly stepped in.</P>
<P>"How is she?" Rosa asked. </P>
<P>" I think an infection has settled in, but she&#146;s fighting it very hard.
  Let&#146;s keep our hopes up," Dr. Sanar said thoughtfully. "She&#146;s upstairs
  on the right and Danielle is still with her."</P>
<P>Rosa walked quickly to the staircase as the doctor escorted the rest of the
  party in. When she entered the room, she saw the princess staring at her daughter
  and holding her hand. </P>
<P>"How is she?"</P>
<P>"Rosa!" Danielle, startled from her thoughts, looked up at the older woman
  and then turned quickly back to Maria. "Maria, look, it&#146;s your mother.
  She&#146;s here for you, Maria."</P>
<P>Danielle stood and motioned for Rosa to move next to the bed. "Please come
  and talk to her. She might respond to your voice. She&#146;s fighting an infection
  of some sort and her fever is getting worse. I know she&#146;ll do better now
  that you&#146;re here."</P>
<P>Danielle stepped away and allowed Rosa to take her place. Her heart broke as
  she watched Rosa&#146;s tears fall while talked to her daughter. Nothing could
  ever compare to the love of a mother, and Danielle knew her own mother must
  have been devastated when she was kidnapped. Backing away quietly, Danielle
  left the room to give them time alone.</P>
<P>"Danielle!" Catherine&#146;s voice reflected her fear as she saw her daughter&#146;s
  torn dress and the dried blood about her arms and legs. "My God, Danielle, are
  you hurt?"</P>
<P>"No, Mother," Danielle said, descending the steps and giving her mother a hug.
  "These are just scrapes and cuts. I&#146;ll be fine, really."</P>
<P>"What happened to your dress?" Catherine said very softly.</P>
<P>"I tore it so I could ride the horse better," she whispered to her mother,
  who was obviously afraid that something horrible had happened to her. "I needed
  to get Maria out of that place as quickly as possible and I wanted to make sure
  I could hang on tight. Don&#146;t worry, nothing happened. Luc and Maria got
  to me in time."</P>
<P>Stepping back from the embrace, Danielle&#146;s gaze immediately fell on Fredrick,
  who was holding Cora in his arms. Fredrick noticed the alarm in the princess&#146;
  eyes and it saddened him, but he completely understood why Danielle stood speechless
  with her questioning gaze.</P>
<P>Catherine noticed the tension and asked Luc to escort her to the sitting room.
  She wanted them to have time to talk.</P>
<P>"I&#146;m so glad you&#146;re unharmed, Princess," Fredrick said slowly, lowering
  his head. "I&#146;m sorry I wasn&#146;t there to assist in your release. Maybe
  I could have done something to protect Maria. I know you don&#146;t believe
  this, but I love her very much."</P>
<P>Sensing a shift in Frederick&#146;s personality from what she&#146;d seen that
  morning, Danielle walked to his side and whispered. "I must talk to you, Fredrick.
  I must explain some things." </P>
<P>"There&#146;s no need for you to say a word," Fredrick replied softly. "I&#146;m
  the one who should explain, but sadly, nothing I say will ever excuse my behavior.
  I hope that Maria will find it in her heart to forgive me, and I hope that one
  day you will look at me without disgust."</P>
<P>"Fredrick," Danielle said, placing her hand on his arm. "I do not think of
  you with disgust. I never did. I hurt you. None of what you saw in the garden
  was Maria&#146;s fault. I&#146;m the one who pursued your sister and it was
  my actions that caused your fight. I&#146;m sorry I hurt you, and if anyone
  should ask for forgiveness, it&#146;s me. I&#146;ve dreamt of one person all
  my life and the moment I saw Maria, I knew it was her that made my heart beat.
  I&#146;m sorry if that angers you, Fredrick, but I understand if it does. Your
  anger should be directed at me and me alone. Please know that Maria wanted nothing
  to do with my advances."</P>
<P>"Well then, Princess," Fredrick smiled gently and whispered, "If it is my sister
  that your heart is calling to, I&#146;d say she&#146;s a very lucky woman, and
  I hope when she recovers that she comes to her senses and runs straight into
  your arms."</P>
<P>Danielle tilted her head in surprise as her eyes widened above raised eyebrows.
  She couldn&#146;t help the smile that came to her lips. That was not at all
  what she expected to hear from Fredrick, and the playfulness with which he delivered
  it caused her to step back in delighted shock. "Did you just say what I think
  you did?"</P>
<P>"Yes," Fredrick said softly. "But don&#146;t you dare tell Maria. I don&#146;t
  want her to think I gave you up that easily."</P>
<P>Closing the small gap between them, Danielle stepped to Fredrick&#146;s side,
  avoiding the dog he still held in his arms, and placed a kiss on his cheek.
  "You are an amazing man, Fredrick. No wonder Maria loves you so much."</P>
<P>"I hope she still does," Fredrick said as the smile left his face. "I&#146;ll
  do everything I can to seek her forgiveness."</P>
<P>"Trust me, Fredrick," Danielle said. "You&#146;ve already been forgiven in
  her eyes."</P>
<P>Danielle reached in and petted Cora&#146;s head. "How are you doing, little
  one?"</P>
<P>Cora barked and her tail began to wag, causing the blanket to move back and
  forth. </P>
<P>"I guess that means she&#146;s doing just fine," Fredrick laughed.</P>
<P>"Thank you for bringing her," Danielle said, quickly sobering. "Maria will
  want her near when she wakes up. Come upstairs and see your sister, Fredrick.
  She&#146;ll sense your presence and love in the room. She needs all the support
  she can get."</P>
<P>"I&#146;m right behind you," Fredrick said, and followed Danielle up the stairs.
