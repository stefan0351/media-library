<P>After five days of traveling they began to come across more of the landmarks
  that Xena remembered. She was sure they were on the right path now. She wanted
  to get to the town called Rhapsody as soon as possible. Xena had been to this
  special community &#151; where artists, bards, and healers lived &#151; many
  seasons ago. She needed healing herbs to replenish her dwindling supply, and
  this town was known for having the most current and highly developed herbs in
  the land.</P>
<P>"It&#146;s only a couple of candlemarks&#146; ride from here," Xena said looking
  down at the blonde walking next to her. "See that mountain over there?"</P>
<P>"The one that looks like a bear&#146;s head?" Gabrielle asked.</P>
<P>"What is it with you and bears? It looks like a mountain, nothing more, nothing
  less," Xena retorted.</P>
<P>"Come on Xena, be a little creative once in a while. Let your mind&#146;s eye
  see past the obvious and envision what could be." Gabrielle rolled her eyes.</P>
<P>"That's your job. My job is to get us to Rhapsody, and I can tell from that
  mountain that we're very close," Xena said. </P>
<P>"Why don't you ride with me so we can get there faster?" </P>
<P>"Xena, you know I like my feet on the ground when at all possible," Gabrielle
  reminded her.</P>
<P>"Head in the clouds. Feet on the ground," was the sarcastic reply.</P>
<P>Gabrielle stopped dead in her tracks, hands on her hips, watching Argo and
  Xena move on ahead. </P>
<P>Thinking silently to herself, Gabrielle let out a heavy sigh. &#145;It&#146;s
  a good thing you&#146;re so beautiful, warrior. I can&#146;t imagine why I put
  up with you.&#146; Staring in amazement at the tall, strong woman, Gabrielle
  let her expression warm and a smile came to her lips. &#145;You've got me tied
  on a string to your little finger and you don't even know it.&#146;</P>
<P>"Wait up, Xena!" Gabrielle yelled to the advancing woman in front of her.</P>
<P>"Come to your senses finally?" Xena stopped, turning in her saddle to watch
  the bard approach.</P>
<P>"Yeah, yeah, give a hand up will you?" Gabrielle said reaching her arm up,
  allowing Xena to lift her effortlessly.</P>
<P>Settling in comfortably behind Xena, Gabrielle tightened her grip around the
  warrior's waist, partly for security and partly because it felt good. </P>
<P>The building warmth between their bodies was inviting and comfortable. Gabrielle
  allowed herself to melt into the feeling. Soon, her body and mind drifted off
  into a dreamy slumber; visions of Xena holding her was the last thing she consciously
  remembered.</P>
<P>Xena felt the weight on her back shift and settle. Taking advantage of the
  state Gabrielle was in, Xena reached down, laying her hand and arm on top of
  the bard&#146;s. She squeezed lightly and left it there, intertwining her fingers
  into the small, soft hand. </P>
<P>Xena knew Gabrielle would love Rhapsody. She&#146;d be in her element and Xena
  planned on letting her indulge herself as much as she wanted to. With all the
  artists and musicians around, she was sure Gabrielle would end up telling stories
  and enjoying the creative energy that flowed through the village. The vision
  made Xena&#146;s heart warm. Seeing Gabrielle enthralled in a good story and
  watching her smile was worth more to her than any of the healing herbs she'd
  be gathering. </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"Gabrielle . . .Gabrielle," Xena was saying softly.</P>
<P>"Huh," came the sleepy reply from behind.</P>
<P>"We&#146;re here," Xena replied.</P>
<P>Lifting her head slowly, Gabrielle gathered her senses. Waking up, she realized
  that her arm, wrapped securely around Xena&#146;s waist, was covered by a strong
  arm and her fingers were interlaced with the warrior&#146;s. This was a new
  development and Gabrielle sat still enjoying the feeling. Emotion engulfed her,
  her breathing became shallow, and she could feel her skin begin to burn and
  her hand tremble.</P>
<P>Xena wondered why Gabrielle was so quiet. Looking down quickly, feeling the
  heat and movement, she realized her mistake and let go immediately. The silence
  from her companion worried Xena. She silently hoped she hadn't been caught.
  With swift skill Xena lowered Gabrielle to the ground. </P>
<P>The stunned bard hit the earth quickly. Her legs were shaky and her face flushed.
  Gaining her balance, Gabrielle tried to bring her breathing under control.</P>
<P>"You okay, Gabrielle?" Xena asked cautiously.</P>
<P>"Huh . . . a . . . yeah, just got down too quickly is all," Gabrielle replied,
  looking down at the ground which was curiously rocking back and forth. </P>
<P>"Why don&#146;t you take a look around. I&#146;ll get a room and check into
  a stall for Argo." Xena looked at Gabrielle, hoping everything was all right
  between them.</P>
<P>"Sure, if that&#146;s what you want, Xena," Gabrielle finally pulled herself
  together enough to look up. She saw the worried expression on Xena&#146;s face
  and smiled, hoping to diffuse the tension and embarrassment of the moment.</P>
<P>"Meet me at that tavern over there in a couple of candlemarks and we&#146;ll
  get a bite to eat." Xena said, pointing to the wooden structure across the road.
</P>
<P>Gabrielle took a deep breath. "Sounds great, Xena. Now that you mention it,
  I am a little hungry." Gabrielle continued to smile, looking up at the woman
  who made her thinking cloudy. </P>
<P>Xena let herself relax as she rode away. Seeing Gabrielle&#146;s smile and
  hearing that she was hungry was enough for Xena to believe that all was well.
  "Oh . . . that was sooo close, Argo," Xena said, patting the side of the mare's
  neck. "I&#146;ll have to be more careful in the future, won&#146;t I, girl?"</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Two candlemarks later Xena sat inside the tavern waiting for Gabrielle to join
  her. A young bard was telling a story. He was nowhere near as talented as Gabrielle
  was and most patrons ignored and even spoke over him. Xena was slightly embarrassed
  for the man. It made her appreciate even more the talent that Gabrielle possessed.</P>
<P>"Xena!" </P>
<P>Xena looked over to the door and saw a radiant Gabrielle. Her smile was wide
  and deep and Xena chuckled to herself. She&#146;d known Gabrielle would love
  this village, and from all appearances she did.</P>
<P>"Hey, did you find anything interesting out there?" Xena asked, standing to
  greet Gabrielle.</P>
<P>"Oh yeah," came the excited reply. "There're all kinds of talented people in
  this town. You wouldn't believe the arts and crafts, and the street musician
  around the corner is amazing."</P>
<P>"I&#146;m glad you&#146;re enjoying yourself." Xena said, motioning Gabrielle
  to a stool next to her.</P>
<P>"There is something I&#146;d love to do while we&#146;re here," Gabrielle was
  saying as she sat down.</P>
<P>"What's that?" Xena inquired, thinking that she already knew what the bard
  was going to say.</P>
<P>"There is a famous woman in town. She is known throughout the land for her
  ability to predict the future. From what all the villagers say, she&#146;s remarkably
  accurate. I&#146;d love to pay her a visit, but only if you&#146;ll come with
  me," Gabrielle added.</P>
<P>That wasn&#146;t at all what Xena was expecting. She thought that Gabrielle
  would want to tell her stories, not visit a fortuneteller.</P>
<P>"A fortuneteller?" Xena asked totally surprised her eyebrows furrowed and her
  lips pursed. </P>
<P>"You know how I feel about that stuff Gabrielle. We make our own destiny and
  nobody can predict what we&#146;ll do. Hades, we don't even know from day to
  day ourselves where we're headed."</P>
<P>"Come on Xena, just indulge me on this. I have a feeling about her and it&#146;s
  not a bad feeling. I think that what she is going to tell me will change my
  life and I&#146;m sure it&#146;s for the better," Gabrielle explained as she
  reached over and grabbed Xena&#146;s hand. "Please come with me."</P>
<P>Xena felt the hand on top of hers squeeze a little. Relieved that Gabrielle
  still felt comfortable enough to innocently touch her, Xena looked at the green
  eyes across from her and melted. &#145;Damn it,&#146; Xena thought, &#145;how
  does she talk me into this stuff?&#146;</P>
<P>"All right, but not until we get something to eat," Xena demanded</P>
<P>"Oh, thank you, Xena. You won&#146;t regret this I promise."</P>
<P>"We&#146;ll see about that." Xena said.</P>
<P>After a filling lunch, Xena and Gabrielle stood in front of a large wooden
  door.</P>
<P>"Are you sure this is the right place, Gabrielle?" Xena asked, looking for
  the usual signs indicating a fortuneteller&#146;s hut. There were no benches
  out front for the waiting clients, who usually sat patiently, ready to throw
  their dinars away. Also, there was no sign indicating a price for this service.
  Xena was getting a little concerned.</P>
<P>"Trust me, this is it," Gabrielle said as she knocked softly on the wooden
  door.</P>
<P>The door slowly creaked open, revealing a dark-haired, dark-skinned woman dressed
  entirely in black. A small rope hung around her neck displaying a large crescent
  moon medallion. A fragrant aroma seeped past the mysterious woman and spilled
  out into the street.</P>
<P>"Hello, my name is Gabrielle and this is my friend Xena," Gabrielle said, turning
  so the woman in the door could get a better look at her visitors.</P>
<P>The warrior gave the woman a smirk as hazel eyes looked up at the tall blue-eyed
  woman standing behind the blonde.</P>
<P>"I understand you are an amazing oracle and well respected. I hope we&#146;re
  not interrupting you, but I&#146;ve come here to ask for your assistance. I&#146;ve
  had a premonition that you will be able to tell me something about my life that
  will change my future." Gabrielle said, hoping for an invitation to enter.</P>
<P>"I see," came a quiet reply. "Premonitions can be good and bad. You have thought
  of this before seeking my guidance?" the woman inquired.</P>
<P>"Yes, I have, and from what I feel in my heart it will be good news. But I
  understand you can guarantee nothing." Gabrielle wanted to make sure the woman
  would continue.</P>
<P>"Very well, please come in.&#146;</P>
<P>Xena grabbed Gabrielle by the arm and brought her head down close to her ear.
  "Aren't you going to ask how much this is going to cost?" Xena whispered.</P>
<P>"No. Whatever it is, it&#146;ll be worth it. Trust me, Xena, I can feel this
  in here," Gabrielle said placing her hand on top of her heart.</P>
<P>Gabrielle walked in and Xena followed behind, keeping a watchful eye around
  the interior. The room was decorated with ornamental wall coverings and burning
  candles of all shapes and colors cast a peaceful glow in the room. A small circular
  table covered by a blue and gold cloth stood in the middle of the room.</P>
<P>"My name is Minerva," the woman said. "You may please take a seat here." she
  motioned for Gabrielle to sit on a wooden stool next to the table.</P>
<P>Gabrielle sat down, looking back at Xena, who was standing within inches of
  her.</P>
<P>"You will please take a seat over there," the woman said, pointing to a bench
  along the wall while staring at the tall woman. </P>
<P>Xena stood still. She wasn&#146;t going anywhere.</P>
<P>"It&#146;s okay, Xena, have a seat. You&#146;ll be able to hear everything.
  It&#146;ll be all right." Gabrielle smiled at Xena.</P>
<P>Obediently, Xena sat down, but she didn't like this one bit.</P>
<P>"Shall we begin?"</P>
<P>Gabrielle nodded her head yes.</P>
<P>Minerva placed four highly decorative ceramic bowls on the table. Reaching
  behind her, she brought out four different wooden boxes and a kettle full of
  boiling water. She poured about a cup of water into each bowl.</P>
<P>"First," she began. "I will look at your early years."</P>
<P>Reaching in a wooden box with her fingertips, Minerva dropped a small amount
  of herbs into the first ceramic bowl. Closing her eyes, she waved her hands
  in front of the bowl, humming a chant, and then peered inside the steaming bowl.</P>
<P>"You come from a small family. I see a mother and father figure present and
  one sibling of the female gender. Also, you left home of your own accord with
  intentions of a different life than that which was planned for you," she finished,
  looking over at the green-eyed woman.</P>
<P>"Yes, that&#146;s amazing," Gabrielle said, looking back at Xena, who gave
  her a half-smile.</P>
<P>Xena silently concluded it was a lucky guess and kept her mouth shut.</P>
<P>"Next," Minerva continued. "We will look for a turning point in your life."</P>
<P>Repeating the same steps as before, but with different herbs, Minerva closed
  her eyes and then opened them, looking at the contents of the bowl.</P>
<P>"Yes, . . . this is very disturbing. You were tricked into thinking you were
  protecting someone, when really they were using you for a great evil. Your hand
  shed blood. Life changed for you at that moment," she again lifted her head
  from the bowl, looking at Gabrielle.</P>
<P>"By the Gods, you&#146;re right again! I thought I was protecting a man seeking
  good. He was showing me the way of the light, or so I thought. He was to be
  sacrificed and I stepped in, stabbing a young woman. It was a trap to catch
  an innocent and I was the bait," Gabrielle brought her head down to her hands
  as she remembered the horrible events of the past. </P>
<P>Xena hated to see Gabrielle upset. She didn&#146;t like where this was going.
  Her guess was that this woman had heard of Dahak and the events at the temple.
  The story of Hope and the Destroyer were legendary and tied directly to Xena
  the Warrior Princess and her poor innocent friend. She must have pegged Gabrielle
  for the sidekick that everyone talked about. It meant nothing, but she could
  tell Gabrielle was getting sucked in.</P>
<P>Gabrielle lifted her head. "Please continue, Minerva."</P>
<P>"The third step will be to look for a great joy bestowed upon you." Minerva
  looked directly at the bard.</P>
<P>Herbs dropped into another steaming bowl, hands moved and the chant began.</P>
<P>"A forgiveness was given from a friend. You worried that your lives would be
  torn apart. A young boy named . . . ," she looked closer at the bowl, trying
  to make out what she saw. "His name was Solan, yes, that&#146;s it. He brought
  you and this friend back to a place of forgiveness and your heart was mended
  with a great joy and love." she let out a deep breath and looked up at Gabrielle.</P>
<P>"How could you possibly know that?" Gabrielle asked with emotion in her voice.
  "Losing my friend was devastating, unbearable, but we were healed of our hate
  with the help of Solan, and I thank the Gods every day for my friend's forgiveness
  and love," she said, looking back at Xena, who also seemed to be visibly shaken.</P>
<P>Xena sat speechless. How did this woman know about this event and her son&#146;s
  name? She wasn&#146;t sure if she should be angry or not. Could this woman really
  be able to see all these things?</P>
<P>"Are you all right, Xena?" Gabrielle asked with concern.</P>
<P>"Um . . . yes. Are you all right?"</P>
<P>"I&#146;m fine, really, and I want to continue. Okay?" she asked, looking at
  the face of the woman she loved.</P>
<P>Xena nodded her head.</P>
<P>Turning back to look at Minerva, Gabrielle asked. "What&#146;s next?"</P>
<P>"Next, I will ask for the question you have come here today to have answered,"
  Minerva said, straightening her medallion and crossing her arms in front of
  her.</P>
<P>"Well," Gabrielle began. "My life has been dedicated to the greater good of
  mankind. I fight alongside Xena to protect the innocent. Even as rewarding as
  this is, I&#146;m missing something that I hope lies in my future. What I would
  really like to know is if there is someone in the universe that looks at me
  through love&#146;s eyes and desires me as a woman? Is there someone out there
  to share an intimate life with?"</P>
<P>Xena started sweating. If this woman could really see things, Xena&#146;s cover
  was about to be blown. Fidgeting, Xena brought her right hand to her forehead
  and wiped off the perspiration with her fingers. She thought about not letting
  this go any further by making up some excuse, but her mind was racing. Nothing
  seemed coherent. &#145;Gods! Think of something!&#146; she mentally cursed herself.
</P>
<P>Looking up, Xena realized the herbs had already fallen into the last bowl.
</P>
<P>"Oh yes . . . I see this person very clearly," Minerva stood now, looking directly
  at the swirling herbs. "The love that this person holds for you is like nothing
  I&#146;ve ever seen. You are very lucky Gabrielle. To them you are the reason
  for living. They feel you in every action they take. The sun sets and rises
  in your eyes and you are the reason that their heart beats."</P>
<P>Xena wasn&#146;t breathing anymore. The room was getting fuzzy as she braced
  her hands on the bench for support. The words definitely described the emotion
  that she felt for Gabrielle. Maybe this was a good thing, she thought. It would
  finally be out on the table. With that moment of clarity, she took a deep breath.</P>
<P>"Can you tell me what this person looks like? I want to make sure I don&#146;t
  pass them by if I should see someone who fits the description." Gabrielle said,
  leaning on the edge of the stool and trying to peer into the bowl herself.</P>
<P>&#145;This is it!&#146; Xena cried silently to herself, closing her eyes and
  praying to the Gods for a good outcome.</P>
<P>"She . . .," Minerva began. "She is of average height, brown eyes, light-skinned
  . . .</P>
<P>"What? What are you talking about?" Xena stood with her hands on her hips,
  eyebrows raised in disbelief.</P>
<P>"That&#146;s not right! She&#146;s at least six feet tall, she has blue eyes
  and . . ." Xena realized she was describing herself, but it was too late. Gabrielle
  and Minerva were both looking at her with a questioning gaze. Xena swallowed
  hard and blinked her eyes. </P>
<P>&#145;Damn, this was not good,&#146; she was thinking to herself. </P>
<P>"I&#146;ll just wait outside," Xena blurted out and bolted for the door.</P>
<P>Once the warrior was outside, Gabrielle turned to Minerva.</P>
<P>"That worked perfectly!" she whispered, trying to hold back her delight.</P>
<P>"Unbelievable, Gabrielle! It couldn't have worked better if we&#146;d had an
  entire season to plan it. I&#146;m so happy for you!" the fake fortuneteller
  said, coming over to hug the blonde.</P>
<P>"You&#146;re an even better actress than I remember, Marta. The Community Theater
  in Potedia must really miss your talent. You memorized everything I told you
  earlier. Nice touch with the candles by the way and hey, what's up with these
  bowls and herbs?" Gabrielle inquired, picking up one of the wooden boxes.</P>
<P>"Well, you only gave me a couple of candlemarks to pull all this together.
  I didn&#146;t have any cards, or anything that would pass as a crystal ball,
  so I just used what I had plenty of . . . tea leaves." Marta said, laughing
  quietly.</P>
<P>"I&#146;m so glad I ran into you today. Thank you for listening to my dilemma
  and for agreeing to do this for me. I had to try and find out the truth without
  making it obvious. I was afraid if I came right out and asked her, it would
  ruin everything." Gabrielle held her friend&#146;s hand and reached up to put
  a small kiss on her cheek.</P>
<P>"I should go check on Xena," Gabrielle stepped back from the embrace. "I want
  to make sure she doesn&#146;t leave."</P>
<P>"Are you going tell her, Gabrielle?"</P>
<P>"Tell her what . . . that I love her?"</P>
<P>"No, tell her that you set her up?" Marta questioned.</P>
<P>"Oh, that minor detail. I&#146;m not sure, Marta. It depends on how the next
  part goes. Wish me luck. Thank you again, I&#146;ll never be able to repay you."</P>
<P>"The only payment I need is to see you two together. Good-bye, Gabrielle, all
  the best to you!"</P>
<P>Gabrielle walked outside and looked for Xena. At first glance she was nowhere
  to be found. Gabrielle&#146;s heart was beating fast. She turned the corner
  and let out a breath. Xena was sitting on the stone steps of the inn, her head
  in her hands.</P>
<P>"Xena?" Gabrielle whispered, sitting down next to her.</P>
<P>"Just let me explain . . ." Xena started, head still hung low, not making eye
  contact with the bard.</P>
<P>Gabrielle interrupted her immediately. "Xena, remember how I said I was sure
  that this visit would change my life for the better? Well, I believe that even
  more now." Gabrielle said, lifting Xena's head with both of her hands. "Your
  addition to the reading guaranteed that for me."</P>
<P>Xena looked into Gabrielle&#146;s eyes almost like it was the first time. She
  saw tears forming and brought her hands up to brush the drops away with her
  thumbs.</P>
<P>"So you&#146;re crying because you&#146;re happy?" Xena asked trying to make
  sure she was on the same page with Gabrielle.</P>
<P>"If you&#146;re the one who desires me, than yes . . . I would be the happiest
  woman alive." Gabrielle said as more tears fell from her eyes.</P>
<P>Xena took a deep breath. The realization of what she was hearing made her weak
  with emotion. She wanted to make sure she said the right thing.</P>
<P>"You&#146;re the reason my heart beats, Gabrielle. I&#146;m in love with you."
  Xena said, moving closer and wrapping her arms around the woman she wanted more
  than anything in the world. </P>
<P>"Oh, Xena, that&#146;s all I&#146;ve ever hoped for. I wanted it to be you
  . . . I wanted it to be you so badly." Gabrielle said kissing the side of Xena&#146;s
  face as she held tightly to the strong embrace. </P>
<P>It seemed like their hold was only for an instant, but Xena noticed people
  looking in their direction. </P>
<P>"Will you come up to our room with me, Gabrielle? People are starting to stare!"
  she whispered into the bard&#146;s ear.</P>
<P>Both women laughed with nervous tension. Neither wanted their declaration of
  love to be a public spectacle. On shaky legs they made their way hand in hand
  to the room.</P>
<P>Xena closed the door behind them and still holding hands, walked the pair to
  the bed. </P>
<P>Sitting on the edge of the bed, Xena looked at Gabrielle and a sadness came
  over her suddenly. "I only see one problem Gabrielle. That woman was so accurate.
  Maybe. . . maybe there is another that you are meant to be with. A woman who
  fits the description she was giving you and whom you are meant to be with."
  Xena hated to say this, but Gabrielle&#146;s happiness was the most important
  thing to her. She loosened her grip on Gabrielle&#146;s hand.</P>
<P>"Xena, I&#146;m exactly where I want to be and well . . . well, to tell you
  the truth, um . . . you see," Gabrielle was tripping all over herself.</P>
<P>Gabrielle stood up from the bed moving directly in front of her love and looked
  directly into her blue eyes.</P>
<P>"I hope you won&#146;t be too mad at me, Xena, I never meant to deceive you
  . . . I hope you can forgive me . . ." Gabrielle tried to break the news as
  gently as possible.</P>
<P>"What are you talking about, Gabrielle?" Xena demanded softly.</P>
<P>"Remember you said it was my job to be the creative one, to see past the obvious
  and envision what could be?" she said dropping to her knees in front of Xena
  as tears welled up again.</P>
<P>"Yes. . ."</P>
<P>"Well, . . . I guess I got a little creative and well, Minerva is really Marta,
  she&#146;s not a fortuneteller but an actress, she&#146;s an old friend of mine
  from Potedia and I ran into her earlier today - are you with me so far?" Gabrielle
  wasn&#146;t sure if what she was seeing in Xena&#146;s eyes was anger or confusion.</P>
<P>"Yes . . ."</P>
<P>"Well, . . . I told her how much I was in love with you and we kind of planned
  the whole thing. I only did it because I was afraid to ask you how you felt
  and I was even more afraid to tell you my feelings. I was afraid I'd ruin everything
  and I just couldn't live without you, Xena . . . even if it meant I would be
  nothing more than your best friend for the rest of my life. I know it was wrong
  and I&#146;m sorry. I just hoped that you&#146;d give me a sign and then you
  did and . . ." Gabrielle was crying in earnest now. She couldn't continue her
  apology.</P>
<P>"You set me up?" Xena asked softy.</P>
<P>"I guess . . . I guess you could say that . . ." Gabrielle breathed out between
  sobs, finally rising and sitting next to Xena on the bed.</P>
<P>Xena turned and pulled Gabrielle&#146;s face to hers. </P>
<P>Gabrielle looked through her tears and she thought she saw compassion and even
  understanding in the crystal blue eyes staring at her.</P>
<P>Xena began kissing away the tears from Gabrielle&#146;s cheeks. </P>
<P>Between kisses she said, "How could I be mad at you for trying to show me that
  you loved me? I was too afraid to do it. Hades, if you had left it up to me,
  we&#146;d have <I>NEVER</I> gotten to this place. If I had to be played for
  a fool, there isn&#146;t any better outcome than this." Xena finished kissing
  away the tears and for the first time, brought her lips to Gabrielle&#146;s.</P>
<P>The passion of four seasons passed through each woman as the kiss deepened.
</P>
<P>This was exactly what Gabrielle had hoped for. She felt Xena&#146;s fingers
  run along the side of her head tenderly, slowly. Upon reaching their resting-place
  on the soft of her neck, Gabrielle felt her head pulled even closer to the eager
  lips of her new lover. Gabrielle&#146;s desire spilled out as a sigh, as Xena's
  tongue ran it&#146;s way across her lips. Gasping deeply, she opened her mouth
  more, allowing Xena to explore even further. </P>
<P>Pulling back to catch her breath, Gabrielle looked at Xena. "I&#146;ve dreamt
  of this but I never expected it to feel so beautiful, Xena. I&#146;m . . . I&#146;m
  a little nervous. I&#146;ve never been with a woman before," she said shyly,
  looking down.</P>
<P>"Is it moving too quickly for you, Gabrielle?" Xena asked tenderly, running
  her hands along the sides of the bard&#146;s arms.</P>
<P>"No, Xena, I don&#146;t want to stop. It&#146;s what I&#146;ve wanted and waited
  for. I just never knew it would feel so incredible." Gabrielle said as her face
  flushed with desire. </P>
<P>"Please . . . please kiss me." </P>
<P>Xena brought her hand back up and pulled Gabrielle closer, bringing their lips
  together again. Seductively, she kissed her lightly, and then taking her time,
  more deeply. Eventually, Xena made her way to a perfect ear, gently sucking
  and licking. The whimpers of delight coming from Gabrielle were all the encouragement
  Xena needed to continue her exploration. </P>
<P>Xena&#146;s skin was dewy with perspiration and the heat between them was stifling.
</P>
<P>She took Gabrielle in her arms, all the while kissing her face, her throat,
  murmuring softly. </P>
<P>"I love you Xena," came a passionate sigh.</P>
<P>"I&#146;m so glad my love," Xena said as she breathed in the sweet scent of
  Gabrielle&#146;s desire. </P>
<P>"I want you so badly, Gabrielle. Are you sure you want to continue?"</P>
<P>Gabrielle nodded and finally replied, "I need you."</P>
<P>Xena slowly and tenderly helped Gabrielle out of her clothes as she continued
  to caress and kiss the beautiful woman before her. After she lay Gabrielle back
  on the bed, Xena stood and removed her leathers. Bending over the bed, Xena
  slowly brought her mouth to a hardened nipple as Gabrielle sat up, wrapping
  her arms around Xena&#146;s waist, pulling her closer as she cried out. Xena
  sucked gently as she laid them both down on the bed.</P>
<P>Gabrielle gasped as Xena moved back and forth between each breast, stopping
  in the hollow to lick and kiss. Xena could feel the warmth beneath her as Gabrielle&#146;s
  hips involuntarily rocked up to meet hers. Feeling her own wetness growing between
  her legs, Xena slowly moved her hand down Gabrielle&#146;s firm stomach, stopping
  just above the blonde curls. Gabrielle sighed and rocked a little harder.</P>
<P>Xena tenderly reached her hand between Gabrielle&#146;s thighs. She was wet
  and slippery. Gabrielle groaned; her heart seeming to pound out of her chest.
  Xena lightly stroked back and forth, feeling the bard respond by moving her
  soft wet center in the rhythm of Xena&#146;s fingers. She gently inserted her
  fingers just inside. </P>
<P>Wanting to feel more of her lover, Gabrielle pushed her hips up and Xena thrust
  her fingers deeper. Xena brought her lips back to Gabrielle&#146;s kissing her
  passionately as she continued her in and out movement with her fingers. </P>
<P>"Oh Xena. . . Oh Xena . . . ," Gabrielle murmured. </P>
<P>Xena felt tiny contractions beginning to grip her fingers. Kissing Gabrielle
  harder, she felt the orgasm deepen. Gabrielle brought her hips up to meet the
  sensation as the feeling overtook her. Falling back to earth, she pulled Xena
  completely on top of her, holding her closely as she allowed her breathing to
  return to normal.</P>
<P>Xena was sure she was crushing the smaller woman, but every time she tried
  to move, Gabrielle's hands held her in place.</P>
<P>"Please stay Xena, I want to feel you on top of me."</P>
<P>Xena thought she heard soft crying.</P>
<P>"Are you okay, Gabrielle?" Xena needed to know.</P>
<P>Soon Gabrielle&#146;s hands were making small circles on Xena&#146;s back.
  "Yes, Xena, I love you," she whispered.</P>
<P>"And I love you." </P>
<P>"I want nothing more than to make you feel like that my love." Gabrielle said.</P>
<P>"I&#146;ve never . . . I&#146;ve never had this experience before. I&#146;m
  afraid you&#146;ll have to teach me," she added softly. </P>
<P>Gently moving to the side of the woman who was just beneath her, Xena propped
  herself up her elbow resting her head in her hand. </P>
<P>Xena looked over at the green, passion filled eyes and said. "It&#146;s all
  right, my beautifully creative bard. That&#146;s my job, your job was getting
  us here." </P>
<P>They smiled lovingly at each other. As Gabrielle&#146;s smile grew, her hand
  reached up behind Xena&#146;s head, pulling Xena&#146;s lips to hers.</P>
