<p>"Dell! Dell! Wake up, we have company."
		  Seela used both hands to gently shake her sleeping companion. "Come on,
		  Dell, wake up."</p>
		<p>"Are you crazy?" Dell rolled over, pulling
		  the blanket up tighter. "It?s the wee hours of the morning and it?s
		  cold out there."</p>
		<p>"Fine, you stay and sleep, but I?m going to
		  go check it out." </p>
		<p>Seela stood up and shook her body slightly to adjust
		  her transparent wings. Slipping a heavy winter tunic around her tiny frame,
		  she lifted her long red hair from beneath the fabric so that it hung freely
		  down her back. She walked to the small door made of twigs and quietly exited
		  the miniature hut.</p>
		<p>Seela listened carefully to the noises. She recognized
		  the sounds ? humans. </p>
		<p>"Oh goody." Seela rubbed her hands together
		  not so much to warm them up, but in anticipation of what she would see. Effortlessly
		  she lifted off the ground and flew across the rocks to a smooth ledge that allowed
		  for a fairy?s-eye view of the inside of the cave.</p>
		<p>Perched unnoticed above the intruders, Seela crossed
		  her legs and sat down. Below her were two female humans covered in snow. The
		  strangers had obviously been caught in the storm that had blanketed the sky
		  for two days straight. Struggling, they pulled off their wet outer coats and
		  laid them on the rocks to dry. The two women moved about the cave separate from
		  each other and intent on their individual maneuvers. Seela marveled at their
		  actions. It seemed that each woman knew exactly what to do to complement the
		  other. No task was duplicated, and without a word spoken, a camp was forming
		  before her eyes. </p>
		<p>?Amazing,? Seela thought, resting an elbow
		  on each knee and dropping her tired head into cupped hands. </p>
		<p>The tall dark-haired woman inspected the surroundings
		  and collected anything that might burn, while the smaller blonde removed and
		  unpacked the supplies from the two horses that were tied at the front entrance
		  of the cave.</p>
		<p>"Have I missed anything good?" Dell whispered,
		  landing gently next to Seela on the ledge and handing her a wooden acorn filled
		  with hot spiced tea.</p>
		<p>"So far they haven?t said one word to each
		  other," Seela said, holding the tiny cup in both hands and breathing the
		  steamy aroma deep into her lungs. "I love this tea."</p>
		<p>"You say that every time." Dell rolled her
		  eyes, sitting and shifting her weight to get comfortable.</p>
		<p>"Well, there?s nothing better than hot tea
		  during a snowstorm," Seela said confidently.</p>
		<p>"Shhh," Dell said, very softly. "The tall
		  one just looked around. I think she heard you."</p>
		<p>The two fairies sat motionless and waited until the blue-eyed
		  human returned to her tasks.</p>
		<p>"That?s impossible," Seela whispered.
		  "She?d have to have incredible hearing to have picked that up."</p>
		<p>"Apparently, she does," Dell commented softly
		  through the side of her mouth, raising an eyebrow.</p>
		<p>The humans finished their chores and warmed themselves
		  by the flames before silently climbing into the bedrolls set directly across
		  from each other on either side of the roaring fire. Obviously exhausted from
		  their travels and from fighting the snowstorm, the women seemed to melt into
		  their blankets and sleep.</p>
		<p>"Not one word?" Dell asked. "Are you sure
		  of that?" </p>
		<p>"Not since I?ve been sitting here," Seela
		  responded. "They haven?t said a single thing. Maybe their tongues
		  have been cut out."</p>
		<p>"Oh, good heavens," Dell snickered. "Do
		  you always have to come up with the most outlandish explanations for everything?
		  I swear, Seela, you crack me up."</p>
		<p>"You never know, it could have happened," Seela
		  said, indignantly.</p>
		<p>"Most likely they?re just exhausted,"
		  Dell smiled at her pouting partner, placing her hand on the tiny shoulder next
		  to her. "If they?ve been travelling through this storm, they probably
		  had no energy left for anything else but sleep. They?ll be out for hours.
		  Why don?t we fly on back to bed and rest for a while?"</p>
		<p>"And miss something?" Seela asked, looking
		  over at her companion. "When is the last time we got to watch something
		  as good as two humans? Lately the only things we?ve had through here are
		  a stray wolf, those pesky bats, and that really smelly warthog. It took me weeks
		  to get that stench out of this cave. They might wake up and talk and I for one
		  don?t want to miss it. This is the best show we?ve had in years."</p>
		<p>"Oh, all right," Dell said, letting out a long
		  yawn. "But, I?m gonna go back and get some things to make us more
		  comfortable. We could be here a while, what with the snow still falling and
		  all."</p>
		<p>"Bring back those dried berries and some of that
		  bread I made. Oh, and how about some apple juice and while you?re at it,
		  a bag of that nut & seed mix," Seela said, turning her attention back
		  to the scene below. </p>
		<p>"Anything else?" Dell asked.</p>
		<p>"Hmm . . . no, that oughtta do it."</p>
		<p>Dell slapped herself playfully in the forehead as she
		  stood up and flew slowly back towards their hut.</p>
		<p>Seela smiled to herself. She loved to give Dell a hard
		  time, and the brown-haired, blue-eyed fairy never failed to respond. This game
		  between them was one of the many reasons she loved her mate so much. She and
		  Dell always remembered to keep their hearts open, humble and childlike and as
		  any good fairy would do, they frolicked in the sense of humor and zest for life
		  that fairies were known for. In short, they liked to have fun with each other.
		  Seela smiled again, happy with the knowledge that Dell made her heart sing with
		  delight. And, it didn?t hurt that she had a nice set of wings too. Seela
		  chuckled as she thought about how attracted she still was to Dell after 128
		  years.</p>
		<p>Below, the small blonde human mumbled something in her
		  sleep, making Seela sit up and take notice. Leaning forward, she strained to
		  hear the words. When she was still unable to make them out, she stood and scanned
		  the cave, making sure it was safe to fly closer.</p>
		<p>Dell returned, loaded down with two bags and a warm blanket.
		  Puzzled by Seela?s absence she quickly dropped the goods and looked around.
		  Within seconds she spotted the small fairy hovering close to the blonde woman.</p>
		<p>"I hate it when you put yourself at risk,"
		  Dell mused to herself, watching her mate below. "It?s never safe to
		  get that close to humans. You know better than that. Rule number one, don?t
		  go near humans." </p>
		<p>Standing with her hands placed firmly on her hips, the
		  dark-haired fairy peered intently looking for any signs of danger. Minutes later,
		  she looked on as Seela finally flew back to the ledge.</p>
		<p>"What do you think you were doing?" Dell said,
		  looking sternly at her partner. "Don?t you ever do that again. You
		  know rule number one."</p>
		<p>"I couldn?t wait," Seela said, lowering
		  her head away from the angry gaze. "She was talking in her sleep and I
		  wanted to hear what she said."</p>
		<p>"So," Dell said relaxing her stance and smiling
		  at the red-haired beauty before her. "What?d she say?"</p>
		<p>"Thought you?d never ask," Seela smiled.
		  "Did you bring back that mix?"</p>
		<p>Seela brushed past Dell and started unloading the bags.
		  After spreading the blanket, she removed the food and juice and sat down. She
		  looked up at the soft blue eyes in front of her, and patted the spot next to
		  her on the blanket. "Take your hands off your hips and come on over here.
		  I?ll tell you exactly what she said." </p>
		<p>Dell?s smile grew wider. She could never stay mad
		  at Seela. </p>
		<p>"So?" Dell said, sitting down.</p>
		<p>"Pass me that juice, Dell."</p>
		<p>"Seela! Come on. What?d she say?"</p>
		<p>"I knew you were into this as much as me,"
		  Seela giggled and slapped Dell playfully on the arm. "She said ?Don?t
		  you ever leave me again? and then she moaned a couple of times and then
		  she said ?My path is your path?."</p>
		<p>"Do you think she was referring to the tall one?"
		  Dell asked, pouring an acorn full of juice. She handed it to Seela and then
		  poured another for herself.</p>
		<p>"That?s my guess," Seela said. "Maybe
		  the blonde-haired woman is mad at the dark-haired woman for leaving her. That
		  would explain the silence between them."</p>
		<p>"That?s possible," Dell said, placing
		  a small hallow reed into the juice and slurping as she sucked. </p>
		<p>Enjoying their breakfast, the two fairies sat in silence
		  watching the scene below them. Both were hoping that the blonde would start
		  talking in her sleep again, and therefore watched intently as they ate. Dell
		  wiped her hands on her knees after she finished her bread, and moved closer
		  to Seela. Still tired from not enough sleep, she rolled onto her back and scooted
		  down, resting her head on her partner?s thigh. After a few minutes, Seela
		  placed her juice on the rocks and brought her hand up to play with Dell?s
		  hair. Running her fingers through the dark brown locks, she looked down at features
		  that always made her heart race and smiled. </p>
		<p>"That feels so good, Seela," Dell hummed; her
		  eyes closed in enjoyment. "I love it when you do . . ."</p>
		<p>THUD!</p>
		<p>"She?s talking again!" Seela said, standing
		  up quickly, forgetting that a certain someone?s head had been supported
		  by her leg.</p>
		<p>"Ouch!" Dell fumed, reaching up to rub the
		  back of her head.</p>
		<p>"I?m going down there."</p>
		<p>Before Dell could protest, Seela was gone.</p>
		<p>Seela fluttered closer to the small woman and this time
		  landed on the pillow, next to her head. The blonde moaned and rambled on incoherently.
		  Seela waited as the mumblings began to form real sentences.</p>
		<p>"Xena, I . . . I knew you?d come for me . .
		  . yes . . . I dreamt of it . . . I wished for you. I wished for your kiss to
		  bring me back."</p>
		<p>Seela?s eye?s widened as she heard the wish
		  for the kiss. She loved nothing more than a good romance and this was getting
		  better all the time. Suddenly the woman shifted and rolled to her side causing
		  the pillow to move. Seela lost her footing and fell just as a hand came up to
		  rest under a human cheek, pinning the fairy?s legs underneath. Seela struggled
		  to move, but it was no use. Panic set in as she realized that her attempts were
		  futile. </p>
		<p>Without regard for herself, Dell flew as fast as she
		  could. She snapped a small twig from the cave wall and hovering to the side
		  of the blonde woman, she brought the twig under her noise and wiggled it. The
		  hand below the cheek whipped out to scratch the annoyance as Dell swerved to
		  get out of the way. Seela, released from her trap, stood up quickly and flew
		  to Dell?s side. Hand in hand they returned to their perch.</p>
		<p>"Don?t say it, Dell," Seela said, still
		  shaking from the near disaster. "It was stupid, I know it, and I?m
		  sorry."</p>
		<p>Dell wrapped her arms around the tiny waist in front
		  of her and pulled Seela close. She kissed her neck and cheek and finally made
		  her way to the trembling lips, devouring them with a passion borne out of worry
		  and love.</p>
		<p>"Seela, don?t ever scare me like that again,"
		  Dell whispered, still holding the redhead close. "I was so worried. I .
		  . . I . . . I couldn?t take it if anything happened to you."</p>
		<p>The pair remained in the embrace a while longer, needing
		  to feel the security of each other?s arms.</p>
		<p>"I?m okay, Dell." </p>
		<p>Seela finally stepped away to look at her partner. She
		  saw the lingering fear in the blue eyes staring back and it made her sad. She
		  did her best to lighten the mood. </p>
		<p>"You wanna know what she said?" </p>
		<p>"Seela!" Dell said, shaking her head. "You
		  wear me out, you know that?"</p>
		<p>"I aim to please," Seela joked, hoping that
		  Dell would relax.</p>
		<p>"Good grief," Dell said exasperated, putting
		  her hands into her hair and pulling it. "What am I going to do with you?"
		  </p>
		<p>"You?re gonna come over here and sit down so
		  I can tell you what the blonde woman said," Seela said, taking Dell?s
		  hand and walking back to the blanket.</p>
		<p>Dell moved to the back of the blanket and pulled Seela
		  in front of her. She wanted her in close range in case she tried to go anywhere
		  again. Seela leaned back as Dell tucked her wings to the side tenderly. Her
		  back resting on Dell?s chest, she felt warm breath invade her ear.</p>
		<p>"Ummm," Seela purred. "You feel good.
		  Nice and warm." </p>
		<p>"You feel good too," Dell whispered, nibbling
		  on the earlobe that was so tempting. She felt a small shake from the fairy in
		  her arms and smiled. Taking her hand, she lifted the long red hair to expose
		  the soft skin of the back of Seela?s neck. Methodically, Dell placed small
		  kisses along the smooth nape, being careful to linger in the area where Seela?s
		  wings met the flesh.</p>
		<p>"Oh, Dell," Seela sighed. "You know that
		  gets to me every time."</p>
		<p>"I aim to please," Dell joked between kisses,
		  using the same line that her partner had just used on her.</p>
		<p>Their movements stilled as a noise focused their attention
		  back to the cave floor. The tall woman stood and stretched, threw more wood
		  scraps on the fire and then walked to the other side, kneeling next to the blonde.
		  Very slowly she brushed the back of her hand along the cheek of the sleeping
		  woman. </p>
		<p>Seela sighed again, but this time it was in response
		  to what she was witnessing. </p>
		<p>"What did the blonde say when you were down there?"
		  Dell asked very quietly.</p>
		<p>"She said she dreamt of Xena coming for her. She
		  had wished for Xena?s kiss that would bring her back," Seela whispered.</p>
		<p>"Bring her back from what?" Dell asked.</p>
		<p>"I have no idea, but I sure hope that tall one is
		  Xena," Seela sighed again.</p>
		<p>As Dell and Seela watched, the blonde slowly reached
		  up and grabbed the hand stroking her cheek. Both fairies leaned forward in unison,
		  listening.</p>
		<p>"Xena, is that you?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, who else?"</p>
		<p>"Is it still snowing?"</p>
		<p>"Hmm . . . I haven?t checked yet. How did you
		  sleep?"</p>
		<p>"I had the weirdest dream. There was some flying
		  thing tickling my nose or something."</p>
		<p>Seela chuckled softly, which got her a small poke from
		  her mate.</p>
		<p>"It was probably just your nose thawing out from
		  being frozen."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, you?re probably right."</p>
		<p>"Xena?"</p>
		<p>"Yes?"</p>
		<p>"There was something else I was dreaming about."</p>
		<p>"Yes?"</p>
		<p>"You remember how you found me on the rock two days
		  ago?"</p>
		<p>"Of course."</p>
		<p>"Your kiss, the one that brought me back . . ."</p>
		<p>"Yes?"</p>
		<p>"I liked it, Xena. I dreamt of it then but I wish
		  for it now."</p>
		<p>Dell squeezed Seela tighter, neither of them breathing.
		  </p>
		<p>The tall dark-haired woman looked down and slowly brought
		  her lips to the blonde woman below her. At first it seemed somewhat innocent
		  but as their lips stayed joined, the strong arms of the blue-eyed woman wrapped
		  themselves around the blonde, pulling her in closer and lifting her in an embrace.</p>
		<p>Dell felt something wet on her forearms and pulled Seela
		  around to look at her. "Are you crying?"</p>
		<p>"Shhh," Seela whispered, sniffing back her
		  tears and turning back to the action below, where the two women still held each
		  other tightly.</p>
		<p>"I love you, Xena."</p>
		<p>"I love you too, Gabrielle."</p>
		<p>"Don?t you ever leave me again. Promise me."</p>
		<p>"I promise."</p>
		<p>The women hugged each other tightly before the green-eyed
		  woman finally pulled back.</p>
		<p>"Did you want to check on the storm?"</p>
		<p>"Who cares about the storm?"</p>
		<p>The blonde reached her arm around and pulled the tall
		  women into another kiss. This time it was more passionate than before. Dell
		  heard sounds that only meant one thing.</p>
		<p>"Let?s go, Seela," Dell said softly. "The
		  show?s over. Even strangers deserve their privacy."</p>
		<p>"That was so beautiful," Seela cried, wiping
		  away her tears as Dell pulled her up to her feet. "Have you ever seen anything
		  that moving in all your years?"</p>
		<p>"Come on, Seela."</p>
		<p>"Let?s just watch a little longer."</p>
		<p>"Oh, no you don?t, Miss Voyeur," Dell
		  said, packing up their goods and rolling up the blanket. "There are rules
		  around here and rule number two is no spying on anyone?s intimacies."</p>
		<p>"More with the rules," Seela frowned. "What
		  is it with you and these rules?"</p>
		<p>"You wanna know what rule number three is?"
		  Dell asked, grabbing the tiny hand next to her.</p>
		<p>"Does it involve kissing?" Seela chuckled.
		  "Because if it involves kissing, then count me in."</p>
		<p>Dell laughed as they lifted off and floated back to their
		  tiny hut.</p>
