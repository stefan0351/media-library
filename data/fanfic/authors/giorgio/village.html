<p>Morning greeted the world with hugs and kisses &#150; a sprinkling of
sun through a rainbow and the laughter of the water as it cascaded over the mountain into
the lake below. This would be an exceptional day, no doubt; after all, it was already
starting out that way. Here it was just after dawn and the bard&#146;s eyes were open even
before the warrior&#146;s. For a few serene minutes she lay with her head on her dark
hero&#146;s chest, relishing in the memory of the last few days. Things were definitely
beginning to allow the ageless duo, as some were beginning to refer to them, a few
days&#146; rest and time to act and react like &#145;normal&#146; people without having to
be either heroes or villains.</p>

<p>Gabrielle could still smell the after scent of making love and it
brought back in clear detail the exquisite feelings of the evening before. &quot;I do love
you so, my warrior. You fill my heart, my mind, and my body. You&#146;re really all I need
to give me peace and make my world complete.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You took the words right out of my mouth.&quot; </p>

<p>Gabrielle jumped, not having been prepared to hear the soft morning
growl of her lover.</p>

<p>&quot;Xena I thought you were still sleeping.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And I was until a certain someone decided to talk to my
breasts.&quot;</p>

<p>Pushing herself up Gabrielle grinned into sleepy blue eyes as they
attempted to bat their way into opening fully. &quot;I was talking to myself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m sorry about that, but I distinctly hear words coming out
of your mouth.&quot; She pulled the small-framed woman back down onto her and kissed her
passionately good morning. &quot;Last night was fantastic, my love. I&#146;m glad we
stayed the extra time here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me, too. Actually with less than a twist of my arm, I could call
this place home.&quot; </p>

<p>Catching the haunting look on her warrior&#146;s face she quickly
rectified the comment. &quot;Not that I&#146;m considering making this our home, I was
just kind of saying that it was . . . you know . . . homey.&quot; She stopped, thought a
second, and then continued. &quot;I guess I was thinking about how we&#146;ve been running
lately. First we were running from . . . and now . . . we&#146;re running to. I think it
would be nice if we had a safe place where we weren&#146;t doing either, a place where we
could just be content. Do you know what I mean, Xena?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think I do, Gabrielle. I know how tough these last few years,
not counting the lost frozen time, have been on you. I&#146;ve watched you change from
bard, to follower, to more of a warrior than I ever imagined you could be, and hopefully
back to bard again, but with many more skills. It looks to me like you&#146;ve come full
circle. When I think about it, we&#146;ve both grown, and if you stop and look at our
life, it has never been an easy one. Yet every change, even though it doesn&#146;t seem so
in the beginning, ends up being for the best by the time the end rolls around.&quot; She
held her bard tightly. &quot;Listen to me; I&#146;m beginning to sound like you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#146;s part of our growing together, my love. I&#146;ve had
to learn to fight and protect and you&#146;ve learned to soften and care. But we are still
opposite sides of the same coin, no matter how much I seem to become more like you, and
vice versa, we only do so in respect to one another.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You really have been doing a lot of thinking about this,
haven&#146;t you Gabrielle?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, especially now that we&#146;re considering going back to the
Amazons. What exactly do you intend to do when we get there Xena? Are we going to settle,
and raise a family? Or are we running to a haven because we&#146;re tired of fighting and
because Eve needs a place to hide for a while?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m still a warrior Gabrielle and always will be, but
I&#146;m tired of fighting constantly. I think it&#146;s time we get some real-life time
for ourselves. We lost the opportunity to raise both our individual children, for one
reason or the other, and then we lost the chance to raise Eve. Maybe destiny is finally on
our side. Once things calm down about the Gods, and life continues its steady course, Eve
will have to choose whether to stay with the Amazons or move on with her life; we
can&#146;t tie her down to ours.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is my brain deciphering correctly what my ears are hearing? Xena
are you saying that you want to settle and raise a family?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did I ask you to marry me, Gabrielle?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do I know you want another child?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Am I talking too much?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, no, my love.&quot; The bard raised up and kissed her
warrior, small eager kisses that covered her entire face. &quot;Oh, Xena &#150; you
don&#146;t know how happy I am at this very minute.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I could venture a good guess. Damn it must be this place. Do you
think Aphrodite purposely put a gab spell on this place to irritate me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No &#150; I think you&#146;re just relaxing and finally being
able to voice what your heart&#146;s been feeling for a long time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come here, you.&quot; Xena pulled the small blonde close and held
her tightly. &quot;I almost lost you forever the last time, Gabrielle. You don&#146;t know
the nightmares I&#146;ve suffered for that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think I can imagine them, Xena. But they&#146;re over now, and
we need to think about what we&#146;re going to do today. I was trying to figure out
before you woke up if we were doing the right thing with all three of us marching into the
village unannounced.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;First of all, we don&#146;t know how much the Amazons know about
our quick thaw. Secondly, we can only hope that some of our friends are still alive to
tell the story of Eve. I don&#146;t want her to come across as a monster like . . . like .
. . &quot; Even now, after all that had happened, there remained words that could destroy,
feelings that were too deep to hide.</p>

<p>&quot;Like Hope. I know Gabrielle; it&#146;s okay.&quot; Xena held her
lover close, pampering, stroking, and soothing away the old hurts that still stung too
sharply at times. &quot;So what are you suggesting . . . that you go in alone?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought maybe that would be best.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#146;t think so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not? I am the Queen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-e-s, the Queen of the Amazons maybe, but that doesn&#146;t make
you the only decision maker in This family. We both have an equal voice . . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Equal voice? Did you say equal voice? I can remember many times
when we ended up doing something solely on your decision, no questions asked . . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Gabrielle, that was when you were still so green behind the
ears you couldn&#146;t even parry with your staff. Our relationship has changed;
we&#146;ve both grown. We are equals. Don&#146;t you know that by now?&quot; </p>

<p>Green eyes began to mist over and a quiver could be heard in the
bard&#146;s voice. &quot;I don&#146;t want the Amazons to hurt you or Eve.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that what all this is about?&quot; Xena lifted
Gabrielle&#146;s face, gently wiping away a tear as it threatened to dampen the slightly
freckled cheek.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot; Gabrielle confessed.</p>

<p>&quot;No Gabrielle. We will face this as a family. We will all go in
together, and the sisters will accept us, challenge us, or banish us. But we will go
through it together. Not one of us will be put to the task alone. Is that
understood?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Unless there&#146;s a challenge for the throne.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We&#146;ll deal with that when . . . If it happens. Now we should
probably get showered and down to the campsite to help Eve with breakfast. She&#146;s
going to begin feeling like an unwanted slave-child.&quot; The warrior smiled at her
attempt to add humor to the situation. &quot;I think I smell the fish starting to cook
already.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You&#146;re right, and I guess you&#146;re right about us all
going in together. All for one and one for all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That sounds like a good motto to me.&quot; The dark warrior
rolled off the bed, grabbed a couple of towels, and sauntered over to the showering area.
&quot;Care to join me, early bird?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure would.&quot; Gabrielle was directly behind her as she
stepped into the cooling waters. &quot;Oooo chilly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Invigorating.&quot; The warrior corrected.</p>

<p>&quot;Pretty close to cold.&quot; Gabrielle insisted.</p>

<p>&quot;Want me to warm you up?&quot; She turned and faced the smaller
woman.</p>

<p>Even with the cold waterfall teasing her tactile sensations, Gabrielle
could feel her insides beginning to warm at the sight of her champion standing
statuesquely in front of her in all her naked glory.</p>

<p>&quot;Gods Xena. Do you know how you affect me?&quot; She stepped
closer and placed two small hands on the hips of her lover.</p>

<p>&quot;The chill has lessened a bit, I presume?&quot; The raven-hair
beauty smiled, nodded, and threw back her head, causing her dark tresses to whip away
from, rather than freely form about her face. This left Gabrielle staring into the stark
exquisite beauty of her dark champion&#146;s features. Xena&#146;s crystal blue eyes
glistened in the early morning sunlight, as the first rays filtered in, creating a rainbow
prism through the falling liquid.</p>

<p>&quot;Water feels almost tepid at this point, my love.&quot; Gabrielle
blushed and turned away. If she stood staring much longer, she wouldn&#146;t be able to
keep from touching the perfect body before her. &quot;I thought you said we should hurry
down to Eve.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle, I still get a glimpse of the rose from you, even now
after all this time?&quot; Xena smiled and stepped closer to her lover, wrapping long
muscular arms around the smaller body, while her breasts ended up touching the all too
sensitive back. Slowly she allowed her hands to run freely down past Gabrielle&#146;s neck
and touch the erect nipples below, as they each sent a telltale message to the
raven-haired beauty. </p>

<p>Doing a quick side-step Xena went from behind to in front of her bard.
Smiling broadly and shaking her hair free of excess water, while without losing a step she
picked Gabrielle up and placed the small woman over her shoulder, then walked over and
threw her down on the bed.</p>

<p>&quot;This will never do, leaving here right now. None of us know how
this day will end. We don&#146;t even know for sure where we will be camping tonight. But
right now . . . this minute . . . this second . . . this is ours to command, and by the
Gods, I plan on devouring you this morning.&quot; Xena stretched out on top of her lover,
covering every inch of Gabrielle with her own body, the bottoms of her legs touching
nothing but the bed covering.</p>

<p>&quot;But Xena . . . remember Eve . . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As I said before,&quot; Xena whispered into Gabrielle&#146;s ear,
&quot;Eve&#146;s a big girl now, and she knows we haven&#146;t had a lot of time together
since we came down from Mt. Etna.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But she&#146;s alone down there, Xena.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We&#146;ve all been there, Gabrielle.&quot; Pulling back from the
small blonde she arched an eyebrow and asked, &quot;Do you not want to make love?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#146;s a ridiculous question.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then stop debating with me, before the mood gets spoiled.&quot;</p>

<p>With a total change in attitude, Gabrielle recaptured the feelings that
had minutes ago been throbbing in her loins and tickling her skin. She closed her eyes and
welcomed her warrior into open arms. </p>

<p>A re-enactment of the evening before had the two gasping and perspiring
as they rocked back and forth on the large, soft bed. They would forever be beholden to
the Goddess of Love for allowing them this special place to mend their emotions and their
lives. </p>

<p>Candlemarks later they lay still entwined, long legs over and between
shorter ones, arms wrapped around each other&#146;s body. &quot;I could stay like this
forever.&quot; Gabrielle finally broke the silence.</p>

<p>&quot;Really? Does that mean you&#146;d give up eating?&quot; Xena
smiled as she waited for a response.</p>

<p>&quot;I truly think you already know the answer to that one. Of course
I couldn&#146;t give up eating. I&#146;d just learn to eat in bed, wrapped around
you.&quot; The small bard giggled as she began unwrapping herself from her warrior.</p>

<p>&quot;Look at that Xena; the sun is clearly visible now. We should get
down to the camp. What do you think of taking some fish along to the village as a token of
good will?</p>

<p>&quot;You&#146;re their Queen, Gabrielle. Do you think you need to
present tokens to your own people?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But we&#146;re not even sure if they&#146;ll remember me. If
everyone we knew is dead, no one will recognize us, Xena. We may not have a village to go
back to.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle.&quot; She took the bard&#146;s face into her hands and
looked into emerald eyes that still held the innocence of youth even after all they had
been through. &quot;I don&#146;t think we will have been forgotten, nor do I think
we&#146;ll get a reception of ignorance. But you know what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If any of your fears come to pass, we&#146;ll do as we&#146;ve
always done when we didn&#146;t feel comfortable, we&#146;ll move on and who knows, maybe
we&#146;ll make this place home for a while.&quot; She gently kissed away the frown on her
lover&#146;s face. &quot;Come on, My Queen, let&#146;s go eat some breakfast.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m in need of another shower.&quot; Gabrielle mock moaned.
&quot;On second thought, maybe we should swim over. I don&#146;t know that we&#146;ll ever
get off this ledge if we try taking another shower.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell you what. I&#146;ll take our clothes and a couple towels and
go down via the forest and then come back up and we can swim over to the shoreline
together.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#146;s a great idea, Xena. I&#146;ll straighten up here and
make the bed while you&#146;re gone.&quot;</p>

<p>Gathering the articles up in her arms, the warrior stepped out into the
sun drenched woods. Within minutes she was back up in the grotto. In the time she had been
gone, Gabrielle had, indeed put everything back in order and was standing naked waiting
for her to arrive. Xena pulled off her nightshirt and placed it on the bed next to
Gabrielle&#146;s. </p>

<p>&quot;So, my bard, are you going to attempt a dive this morning?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#146;t know, the water seems to come up and hit me in the
face every time I look down at it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If it will make it any easier for you, we could hold hands, then
run and jump through the water, putting us out over the falls. Want to try it that way?
Sounds like fun to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, but don&#146;t let go of my hand until we hit the water,
promise?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Promise.&quot; </p>

<p>Picking a sparse area of cascading water, Xena took Gabrielle&#146;s
hand and started counting. Shortening her steps so the bard could keep up, they began at
the back of the grotto and started running. Gabrielle almost backed out at the last
minute, but the warrior held the small hand in her powerful, larger one and with a slight
yank as they neared the edge of the ledge, both the women jumped through the waterfall. </p>

<p>A primordial scream loosed itself from the lungs of the bard and the
warrior laughed, holding on to her partner, just like she had promised &#150; for dear
life.</p>

<p>Seconds later they were making their way up from the depths of the
lake.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow &#150; that was certainly a rush.&quot; Gabrielle gurgled as
she came up for air.</p>

<p>&quot;Next time you get to dive.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think I&#146;ll pass on that for a while.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Wanna race to shore?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Xena do I really look that stupid?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well . . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Enough! Just swim.&quot;</p>

<p>They looked over toward Eve&#146;s campsite and noticed the younger
woman looking out toward them. Eve heard Gabrielle&#146;s outcry and looked up to see what
was falling out of the sky screaming. She waved when she saw them both come up after the
jump, and they waved back. </p>

<p>Upon reaching the soft ground around the water line, Eve handed each of
them one of the towels Xena had placed on the platform earlier.</p>

<p>&quot;I cooked some fish up a bit ago, thinking maybe you&#146;d be
down earlier. When you didn&#146;t come I went ahead and ate them and then caught some
more. I have an entire bag full of cleaned catch.&quot; Eve stated matter of factly.</p>

<p>&quot;That&#146;s wonderful, Eve. Thank you. We were just talking about
taking some fish into the village with us; do you have enough?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I don&#146;t, I could get more while you two are eating. These
are hungry fish, Mom.&quot; She smiled over at Gabrielle. </p>

<p>The endearing term, although welcomed, caught the blonde off guard and
she smiled at the use of her new title. She found it amusing and chuckled to herself about
the looks she anticipated getting, having Eve, a woman looking near to her own age,
calling her Mom.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess we can worry about that After we eat what you&#146;ve
already cooked. I&#146;m starving.&quot; </p>

<p>Warrior and bard toweled dry and dressed while Eve put the partially
cooked breakfast back on the fire. She made herself busy while awaiting the arrival of her
Moms by gathering berries, brewing tea and working on a spear to add variety to her
fishing techniques. </p>

<p>&quot;Are you going to eat with us Eve?&quot; Xena asked picking up one
of the filled plates and a cup of tea.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I thought I&#146;d go try this new &#145;chucker&#146; out
while you two were eating. Enjoy.&quot; </p>

<p>Gabrielle caught the melancholy tone in the younger woman&#146;s voice
and laid a hand on her shoulder when she passed by on her way to the lake. &quot;Wait a
minute, Eve.&quot; </p>

<p>Deep blue eyes, with the haunting look that occasionally filled
Xena&#146;s, looked down at Gabrielle. &quot;Something&#146;s troubling you, Eve. Why
don&#146;t you sit down with us while we eat and talk about it?&quot;</p>

<p>Seemingly relieved to be able to unburden some of her thoughts, Eve put
the spear down and took a seat across from her mothers. The pain in her eyes pulled at the
heartstrings of the older women.</p>

<p>&quot;I feel so lost; it&#146;s hard to know where to begin. So much
has happened in these past few moons. My life has been altered beyond recognition and I
have no idea in what direction I am being led. I was reading one of your scrolls last
night Mom, where Mother was wondering if she would ever be able to live down her
reputation as being an evil warlord. That corresponds so vividly to the thoughts I&#146;m
having about myself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eve you&#146;re nothing like I was . . . &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I was mother. I murdered and pillaged. I killed innocents
without a second thought.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Eve, you thought you were doing it in the name of Rome.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not in the end. I was simply trying to hurt you and Mom. I
didn&#146;t care; my heart was stone to all the pain I was inflicting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But then you were forgiven, Eve.&quot; Gabrielle walked over and
sat beside the younger woman, placing a comforting arm around her shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;It was too easy. I shouldn&#146;t be allowed to simply say,
&#145;Hey, I&#146;m sorry. Let&#146;s all act like it never happened.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not? You&#146;re own guilt is torture enough. You are sorry
for the harm you caused, aren&#146;t you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but I&#146;ll never be able to bring back the loved ones of
the people I left behind. When I think of the villages that were torched in my name or
Rome&#146;s . . . &quot; she shuddered, &quot; . . . nightmares haunt my dreams and
sometimes my daydreams aren&#146;t any better.&quot; Allowing Gabrielle to hold her she
sobbed as acrid tears lined her face, her breath coming in short shallow spurts. &quot;I
feel so dirty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#146;s okay, Eve.&quot; Gabrielle tried to assure the sobbing
woman. She looked over at Xena who was sitting frozen, looking toward the lake. Narrowing
her green eyes, and clearing her throat, Gabrielle tried to get a response from the
warrior who just kept staring in the opposite direction. She turned her attention back to
Eve and tried to calm her down.</p>

<p>&quot;Unfortunately you can&#146;t go back and undo your entire life
Eve. We all have to go on from this point right here and right now. You have to try to be
the best person you can be from now on. Believe me, you will probably never lose your
warrior instinct any more than your mother has hers, but you can follow in your
mother&#146;s footsteps and turn into a champion for the greater good.&quot;</p>

<p>She tried again to get Xena&#146;s attention but to no avail.
&quot;Look at all the honorable deeds your mother has done since her reign of . . . um . .
. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Terror.&quot; A soft contralto voice growled the sentence to
completion. Xena looked over at the two women she cared for the most in the world as they
clung to each other for support. &quot;Terror,&quot; she repeated. </p>

<p>&quot;Xena, I didn&#146;t mean . . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know, Gabrielle but that&#146;s the only word that would
describe the fear I wielded during those years.&quot; She walked over and sat on the other
side of her daughter. Gabrielle relinquished her hold on Eve and motioned for Xena to take
over.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m not very good at talks like this, Eve, but I can
honestly say that I know what you&#146;re going through, and the metamorphosis from
warlord to crusader is not an easy one. People will hate you and hate your memory and
there is nothing I can say to you that will make that reality go away. But you have me,
and what is more, you have Gabrielle; she&#146;s the only reason I was able to make the
transition. We can&#146;t stop all the pain, but we are great buffers.&quot; She held the
woman/child close and sang the soft lullaby that she used to sing to her as a baby, before
their world changed forever. </p>

<p>Soft emerald eyes smiled at the sight of mother comforting daughter,
and a tear trickled down Gabrielle&#146;s face at the memory of a baby that was lost to
them forever. She turned and began picking at the meal she had left untouched when Eve
began her confession.</p>

<p>After a few minutes Eve gave Xena a long hug and pulled away slowly.
&quot;Thanks.&quot; She looked at one and then the other of her mothers. &quot;I know it
will just take time to heal and I really am thankful that I have the two of you to lean
on.&quot; She stood up, walked over and picked up Xena&#146;s unfinished plate. &quot;I
think maybe it&#146;s time for you to finish your breakfast. I&#146;m going to go spear
some fish to take along with us.&quot; With that she picked up her new fishing gear and
walked over to the lake.</p>

<p>&quot;She&#146;ll be fine, Xena,&quot; Gabrielle assured her warrior as
she refilled her cup with hot tea.</p>

<p>&quot;She will as long as you&#146;re around to say the right things
and give encouragement.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You didn&#146;t do too bad a job yourself, warrior.&quot;
Gabrielle kissed her champion on the cheek. &quot;I&#146;m going to start cleaning up
here. We want to make sure we enter Amazon territory while the sun is still high.
Don&#146;t you think it would be best if we entered a candlemark or two from the
village?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Popping into the middle of the village unannounced might
cause a bit of a ruckus,&quot; Xena agreed. She finished her meal and downed the tea
before getting up and helping to dismantle the campsite and scatter the fire.</p>

<p>Gabrielle rolled up Eve&#146;s bedroll and piled most everything she
could find onto the platform. The lovers stood side by side, Xena&#146;s arm around
Gabrielle&#146;s shoulders as they watched their daughter practicing with her new tool.</p>

<p>&quot;She&#146;s pretty good at that, Xena. Looks like she has a bag
full already.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course she&#146;s good,&quot; Xena beamed proudly,
&quot;she&#146;s my . . . &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Excuse me?&quot; Gabrielle smiled up at her champion.</p>

<p>&quot;She&#146;s our daughter.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;That being the case, why don&#146;t you go help our daughter by
scaling and filleting those critters and then we can be on our way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sounds like a plan to me,&quot; she kissed Gabrielle softly on
the forehead and walked closer to the lake.</p>

<p>&quot;Eve,&quot; she shouted getting the young woman&#146;s attention.
&quot;Toss me the bag and I&#146;ll start cleaning the fish. Gabrielle&#146;s getting
anxious to leave.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Great, I&#146;ll keep spearing until you get caught up with me
and then quit.&quot; She threw the bag in her mother&#146;s direction.</p>

<p>&quot;Okay.&quot; Catching the container, she began scaling &#150;
humming as she worked. Gabrielle came and sat beside her on a large rock overlooking the
peaceful lake. </p>

<p>&quot;You know Xena, if things don&#146;t work out well for Eve in the
village . . . &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now who&#146;s sounding negative. Gabrielle you always tell me to
look on the bright side. I think you need to take your own advice. I&#146;m sure
everything will go fine with the Amazons. You&#146;re their Queen, remember?&quot;</p>

<p>The small bard forced a smile, &quot;Yeah,&quot; she mumbled &#150;
&quot;I&#146;m their Queen.&quot;</p>

<p>Feeling playful Xena picked up the next fish and tossed it at
Gabrielle, hitting her neatly in the chest.</p>

<p>&quot;What was that for?&quot; A not too pleased Queen wanted to know.
&quot;Was it supposed to be funny?&quot; She tossed it back at the scale-covered warrior.
&quot;I hope you intend on bathing before we leave for the village; at the rate
you&#146;re going, if you don&#146;t, they&#146;ll just have to sniff to know we&#146;ve
arrived.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh? Well, if that&#146;s the case, all of us might as well smell
the same.&quot; She got up and ran toward the retreating bard.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on Xena &#150; don&#146;t.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, poor Gabrielle. Don&#146;t you want to smell like fish?&quot;
Catching up with the small blonde she waved the offending object in Gabrielle&#146;s face.</p>

<p>&quot;I think you&#146;ve succeeded in getting my mind off Amazons for
a while. Can we stop playing with the food now?&quot; She pushed the fish away from her
face and looked around for anything she might have overlooked earlier to place onto the
platform. </p>

<p>&quot;Eve!&quot; Xena yelled. &quot;I think we have enough fish. Hurry
and bring in what you&#146;ve got so I can get cleaned up before we leave. Gabrielle
insists I take a bath.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, be right there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I might as well finish up the last ones she brings in, no sense
in anyone else getting messy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#146;s so sweet of you Xena.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. That&#146;s me, Miss Sweet.&quot; Xena shook her head and
continued cleaning the last of the fish in her possession.</p>

<p>With water dripping everywhere, Eve handed her mother the last of the
fish and went to grab one of the towels Gabrielle brought down from the cave.</p>

<p>&quot;So, what&#146;s the plan of action, Mom?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot; Gabrielle looked questioningly at her daughter.</p>

<p>&quot;Are we going to pop into the middle of the village
unannounced?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Eve. We decided to aim for an area a few candlemarks from the
village. That way the lookouts will spot us and escort us in. No sense drawing more
attention than we already will be receiving.&quot;</p>

<p>The fish were all cleaned and boned and Xena placed them into the bag,
before she stripped down and got into the cool water. Normally, Gabrielle would have
joined her, but today she didn&#146;t want to delay any more than necessary. She grabbed
the towel that was still on the platform and walked over to the edge of the lake. Sitting
down on a warm rock she watched her lover as she soaped the smell of fish from her body.
When she finished, Gabrielle was standing there, waiting to hand her the sun-warmed cloth.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, where&#146;s Eve?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the bushes,&quot; Gabrielle nodded beyond the campsite.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, then I guess we all just about ready. Are you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;ve been ready.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That&#146;s a first.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle took the towel before Xena let it drop onto the ground and
started toward the platform. &quot;Why don&#146;t I go up first with all this stuff and
put away what we aren&#146;t taking?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sounds like a good idea. We&#146;ll follow as soon as I know this
fire is good and out. Think I&#146;ll put a little water on it; I&#146;d like this place
to still be here when we return.&quot; She walked over to the platform with Gabrielle and
gave her a kiss on the cheek before turning the key. &quot;See you in a bit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay.&quot; </p>

<p>In an instant Gabrielle was gone along with all the supplies. Xena
finished with the fire just about the time Eve came back. The younger woman had an odd
look on her face as she approached her mother.</p>

<p>&quot;Nervous Eve?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A little, Mother. I don&#146;t know what to expect from these
women.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just let me and Gabrielle handle the Amazons to begin with.
Gabrielle did show you the acceptable greeting didn&#146;t she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, she wanted to make sure I knew it before we arrived in their
territory, &quot; Eve told her mother.</p>

<p>&quot;Good.&quot; Xena looked around to make sure everything was picked
up, then kicked the fire one more time, and stepped onto the platform beside her daughter.
&quot;Ready.&quot;</p>

<p>Eve nodded in the affirmative. </p>

<p>&quot;Okay, here we go.&quot; Bending down Xena turned the key then
took it out and put it into a small pouch. The next thing the two women saw was the inside
of the grotto.</p>

<p>&quot;Everything&#146;s ready to go, Xena.&quot; Gabrielle informed the
warrior upon her arrival. &quot;I&#146;ve loaded the horses with all we wanted to take and
put the things we wanted to leave behind over on the shelves.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Great. Let&#146;s go.&quot;</p>

<p>The three women stood next to the laden horses as Xena concentrated on
where she thought it would be best for them to appear in the Amazon woods. Within seconds
the sound of the waterfall and the warm breeze of the magical forest were replaced with a
slightly cooler atmosphere. </p>

<p>&quot;We&#146;re here.&quot; Gabrielle remarked as she looked around
the dense wood.</p>

<p>&quot;We certainly are.&quot; Xena agreed.</p>

<p>&quot;A little colder here, isn&#146;t it?&quot; Eve asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, we&#146;re farther north.&quot; Taking Argo&#146;s rein she
mounted, then reached her hand down to help Eve up behind her on the horse. When Gabrielle
got settled onto her own horse, they began trotting in a still northerly direction.
&quot;I would think we should be prepared for meeting a few Amazon&#146;s before the sun
moves too much more to the west,&quot; Xena informed her companions.</p>

<p>With her usual precision Xena&#146;s information was correct, and
before another candlemark there was a rustling heard in the trees above them. Assuming it
was Amazons and not animals the three &#145;visitors&#146; took the ceremonial position
and awaited the consensus from the new arrivals that they were at least not enemies.</p>

<p>Minutes later, they found themselves surrounded by masked warriors. </p>

<p>&quot;Speak your name!&quot; The leader commanded of the three
intruders.</p>

<p>&quot;I am Gabrielle, Queen of the Amazons, and this is my champion,
Xena and our daughter, Eve,&quot; The small blonde announced.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, and I&#146;m Hippolyte, most famous Queen of the Amazons,
daughter of Ares, and these are my followers.&quot; </p>

<p>Tittering could be heard coming from under the masks of the entire
Amazon group, until the leader turned and stared at them with venom in her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you doubt that we are who I said we are?&quot; Gabrielle
asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Because our Queen would never bring the destroyer of Artemis and
her bitch child here to these sacred grounds.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena put a hand on her chakram, preparing for the inevitable.</p>

<p>&quot;Now you hold on just a minute there!&quot; Gabrielle dismounted.
The anger in her eyes and voice caused the warrior in front of her to back up a few steps.
&quot;I am Gabrielle, and before you or the tribe go around casting judgement, you need to
hear the entire story.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, you want to tell me a story, Bard Queen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You&#146;ll regret that tone, I promise,&quot; Gabrielle
continued. &quot;I want the entire tribe to be privy to the truth,&quot; The small blonde
responded in a firm voice belying her stature.</p>

<p>&quot;Guess it wouldn&#146;t hurt to take you back to the
village,&quot; the leader condescended. &quot;If one of the old timers can recognize you .
. . then we&#146;ll let you talk. Otherwise . . . &quot;</p>

<p>Unable to hold her tongue any longer, Xena spoke up. &quot;You will
apologize to your Queen before the sun sets on this day, mark my word.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, we&#146;ll see.&quot;</p>

<p>The leader instructed the rest of the Amazons to keep their masks on
then told Xena and Eve to get down from the horses. Xena glanced over at Gabrielle before
seemingly obeying an order; she felt it was best to keep peace for the time being. </p>

<p>One of the warriors started to take Argo&#146;s reins, but the blue
icicles that shot at her from the eyes of the tall, dark-haired warrior, who so resembled
the tales she had been told as a child of Xena Warrior Princess, deterred her from
following through. Instead she motioned for her sisters to flank the three strangers on
all sides as they escorted them toward the village.</p>

<p>Gabrielle looked over at Xena and a strong arm was casually slung over
her shoulders as they continued to walk. &quot;Don&#146;t worry, it will all work out
fine,&quot; the warrior assured her bard.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope you&#146;re right Xena.&quot;</p>

<p>The masked Amazons and the three strangers walked the rest of the way
in silence back to the center of the village.</p>

<p>Upon entering the village the leader instructed one of the guards to go
inform the Queen of the stranger&#146;s arrival and told yet another to go get at least
one of the village elders and bring her to the meeting room.</p>

<p>She turned to another guard and instructed her to take the
stranger&#146;s weapons. Gabrielle allowed her to take the sais. Eve did not resist when
her sword was taken. Xena unsheathed and handed her sword to the smaller woman, but when
the Amazon glanced in the direction of the chakram, Xena curtly shook her head and
growled, &quot;Over my dead body.&quot; Terrified of the ominous stranger, the woman/girl
seemed satisfied with the bounty already collected and went on her way. </p>

<p>After giving feeding and brushing instructions, Xena agreed to allow a
young member to take the horses, and yet another Amazon led the three women into the great
meeting room. Gabrielle could see in the distance the porch of the hut they had used so
many springs ago when they brought Eve here to initiate her into the tribe as an Amazon
Princess. Her eyes misted over as she remembered that poignant time in their lives where,
for a few days, they were able to almost forget their problems.</p>

<p>Seated together in the main hall they talked amongst themselves while
awaiting the arrival of the reigning Queen and the tribe&#146;s elders. Gabrielle was
hoping that the women would be old friends. If a few of the Amazons they knew from before
were still alive that would make this new situation more palatable to everyone involved.</p>

<p>They listened to the commotion outside the hall as more and more of the
villagers heard that the strangers included a woman who claimed to be Queen Gabrielle, her
champion Xena and their daughter, known as the Harbinger of Death to the Gods. The drums
began pounding out a steady beat as the cacophony of voices reached a crescendo.</p>

<p>Suddenly all went dead silent and a single unmasked guard appeared at
the door.</p>

<p>&quot;If you will follow me,&quot; she motioned to the three sitting
alone in the large room.</p>

<p>Xena positioned herself between and slightly to the back of the two
women she would die to protect. She placed one hand on the shoulder of each and bent
forward whispering, &quot;Remember all for one and one for all.&quot;</p>

<p>That brought an immediate smile to the small blonde&#146;s lips, and
Eve gave her mother a questioning look, receiving only a knowing smile, explaining
nothing.</p>

<p>The late afternoon sun was, by this time, beginning to throw shadows on
the huts as it seemed as though the entire village was gathered around the already flaming
bonfire. Amazons in ceremonial tunics and with war paint on their faces were dancing
around the flames. The three strangers were lead to the middle of the on-goings and told
to kneel at the base of the Queen&#146;s throne.</p>

<p>Eve went down on one knee and her mother immediately pulled her back
up. When she looked over, Xena put a finger to her lips and simply shook her head
&#145;no&#146;. </p>

<p>Gabrielle was the first to speak.</p>

<p>&quot;I mean you no disrespect, but as rightful Queen of this village I
refuse to bow to an equal as do my champion and my daughter.&quot;</p>

<p>As a guard began to approach the three strangers, the regent put out
her arm halting the warrior in her tracks. </p>

<p>&quot;We shall see! For now I will not take that as an indiscretion,
until I am able to hear the story in full.&quot; </p>

<p>It was at this point that a loud, eerie cry was hear from a short
distance away. Everyone turned and watched as an older woman, flanked by two young
Amazons, came hurrying toward the center of the village. </p>

<p>&quot;Are my eyes deceiving me?&quot; The woman&#146;s voice rose above
the clamor. &quot;Queen Gabrielle? Xena? Is that really you? By the Gods is That
Eve?&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle looked at the woman and then at Xena as she whispered,
&quot;Xena do you recognize her?&quot;</p>

<p>A small sad smile appeared on Xena&#146;s face as she remember back to
their last visit and to the high-spirited young Amazon who seemed to have had such a crush
on her. She remembered that the young girl had been so willing to take Gabrielle&#146;s
place that she cleaned the entire Queen&#146;s hut by herself, just to be able to spend
time with the great warrior, Xena. &quot;Gabrielle,&quot; Xena whispered back, &quot;I
believe it&#146;s Eris.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; The bard objected.</p>

<p>&quot;Look hard, my bard.&quot; Xena insisted.</p>

<p>Taking a second long look at the woman now standing before them, it
became quite clear that Xena was right; it was the once exuberant Eris. </p>

<p>With sadness in her emerald eyes that matched the same emotions she
displayed the first time they saw the aged Joxer, Gabrielle softly acknowledged their old
friend.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello, Eris.&quot; The small blonde extended her hand, which the
Amazon quickly ignored, instead falling down on her aged knees. A hush fell over the
entire congregation as they watched the interaction between the two players.</p>

<p>&quot;Queen Gabrielle we thought you dead and then we . . . &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Get up Eris!&quot; Gabrielle would have none of this. She just
wanted to set everyone right as to who they were, not to have friends groveling at her
feet. Putting out her hands she helped the woman to a standing position. &quot;Hello my
old friend,&quot; the blonde smiled as she looked into mature eyes, but through the eyes
of memory Gabrielle only saw the sparkling eyes of the younger version of the woman now
standing before her.</p>

<p>&quot;Time has treated you well, Eris.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fairly well, my Queen,&quot; the Amazon agreed.</p>

<p>The reigning queen waved for a stool to be placed behind the older
woman so she could sit and converse with the strangers and perhaps help the village better
understand what was happening. Gabrielle, Xena, and Eve sat on the ground in front of her,
and the rest of the Amazons sat where they stood. It seemed that it was story-telling time
and the entire village was already enthralled.</p>

<p>Eris looked at the Bard Queen and started to fill her in on what the
Amazons knew of present and past happenings. &quot;We were told about you demise many
moons after Eve&#146;s initiation. We mourned for the three of you, and our Shamaness,
Aello, tried to contact the other side . . . first seeking counsel with Yakut and then you
. . . but all to know avail.&quot; She looked over at Eve and shook her head.
&quot;It&#146;s hard to believe I baby sat you 25 springs ago and now here you are again,
all grown up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eris,&quot; Gabrielle interrupted, &quot;please, back on the
subject at hand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yeah . . . sure.&quot; She straightened up and continued with
her story. &quot;A few moons back we began hearing chatter again about you and Xena having
come back from the dead. The stories persisted and we began to listen closer. We also
heard of Livia, but her conquests in Rome did not interest us, so we ignored any news of
her until someone came back with the story that Livia and Xena&#146;s baby Eve were the
same person. It was when Artemis no longer seemed to answer our prayers that we began to
investigate and listen to the story tellers about what happened down here and up on
Olympus a few moons ago. They said Xena killed both Artemis and Athena and that she also
mortally wounded you and that you killed Eve. The village went crazy, and there were
sisters who wanted to see Xena dead and others that were celebrating the fact that you
killed the bitch child who was born to fell the gods. The new warriors didn&#146;t
understand that it was all a part of everyone&#146;s destiny and that the change would
bring with it a period of growth.&quot;</p>

<p>The compassion that the gentle Bard Queen still held for her sisters
was not lost on the older Amazon as she looked deep into eyes the color of a warm Spring
meadow.</p>

<p>&quot;I can see that at least some of the rumors were just that, Queen
Gabrielle, as you and Eve are both sitting here before me.&quot; She smiled at her Queen,
and Gabrielle didn&#146;t have the heart to go into the entire story and confuse everyone
even more.</p>

<p>&quot;So Eris, are you the only one left of our friends?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Rhea is still here, but she got sick a few moons ago and is
always tired any more. She&#146;s sleeping, but will be so pleased to see the three of
you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did she ever have a child, Eris?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She birthed me.&quot; The voice came from somewhere in the middle
of the assemblage. An Amazon, looking not to be too much younger than Eve stood up.
&quot;Rhea is my mother. I am Toxaris, and I am honored to be in the presence of the Bard
Queen, her champion and their daughter, Eve.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are pleased to meet you, also, Toxaris. I would be honored to
speak with you and your mother later, after we have straightened everything out
here.&quot;</p>

<p>The young woman smiled and sat back down, gossiping quietly with her
friends.</p>

<p>Eris cleared her throat and began to speak again. &quot;It took a while
for us to get all the facts about exactly how you two came back to life having not aged so
much as a day. The stories were very difficult to believe. During all the confusion of
your being reborn, Livia being Eve and gods being killed, there was chaos here in the
village. Then some of us started having dreams and Aphrodite appeared to the Shamaness
telling her that to survive we needed to let go of some of the old ways and move on. Leave
it to the Goddess of Love to have such a forgiving heart.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She does have that, Eris.&quot; Gabrielle agreed. &quot;So what
you are telling us then, is that even to this day some of the sisters believed that we
came back and some didn&#146;t?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And of those who believed we were alive, some hated both Xena and
Eve?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; Gabrielle stood up and faced the entire tribe.
&quot;Now that I&#146;m fairly sure you all agree that we are definitely alive and that we
are who we say we are, I think it only fair to tell you why it is we have come back to the
village.&quot; She looked down at Xena and then over at Eve and smiled.</p>

<p>&quot;It seems to me as though you&#146;ve gotten most of the facts as
they were played out. None of us have been in control of this drama that has been playing
out. Eve, as you older Amazons and perhaps your children already know, was born to bring
about a change in belief systems. If the gods had not viciously gone after her as a baby,
things might have . . . No . . . would have turned out differently; I am absolutely sure
of that. The twilight of the gods did not have to mean their total demise as you can see
with the continuing existence of Aphrodite. Had they not used violence out of fear,
perhaps they would have disappeared into a sort of retirement in time to come, but that
was not as it was to turn out to be.&quot;</p>

<p>She turned and approached the reigning queen. &quot;I know it must be
hard for you to conceive, but I still am the Queen of this tribe and my family and I have
come home to heal. We have seen enough of the hate that consumes the world for a while and
want just to settle down and be part of our Amazonian family. Xena and I came back to
consummate our love for one another with an Amazonian wedding and we brought our daughter
back to get her away from those who would do her harm. I hope we are welcome here.&quot;</p>

<p>The regal Amazon looked at Gabrielle then at Xena and Eve. She thought
for a few minutes before answering the rightful Queen. With no trace of a smile she began
her dissertation. &quot;My name is Tecmessa, descendent from that Tecmessa who died at the
hands of Hercules along with Asteria and many other great Amazons during the battle over
Hippolyte&#146;s girdle. I have been Queen of this village for many seasons now. I have
seen youngsters grow into fine warriors and I have weathered living under the heroic
stories of an ancient queen and her champion. You, Gabrielle, have been gone from this
family for 25 winters, whether of your own doing or not. What makes you think that you
should be able to come back and claim your Queenhood on a whim? An entire generation has
grown in the period of time you have been gone. You are but a memory, Gabrielle; a story
we tell our children of the Bard Queen, her Warrior/Champion and the daughter who would
bring the Gods to their knees. If you want the queen&#146;s mask back, you will have to
face the ultimate challenge. I do not intend to simply hand over my throne to you.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle smiled but her eyes betrayed a glint of sadness. &quot;I was
afraid it was going to come down to this. I can&#146;t say I&#146;m surprised. I would
probably feel the same way if I were you. At least you believe that we are who we say we
are.&quot; Gabrielle looked over at Xena before finishing her conversation and the
raven-haired beauty nodded discretely at her lover. </p>

<p>&quot;I am prepared to accept your challenge, Queen Tecmessa &quot;</p>

<p>A whooping cry rose up from the throng and the small blonde smiled, not
knowing if the acknowledgement was for or against her and really not caring, at least she
could see that the Amazons had not lost their appetite for competition.</p>

<p>&quot;Being the challenged, Queen Gabrielle,&quot; the reigning queen
addressed her with the honored title, &quot;the choice of weapons is yours.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena could stand the banter no longer; she stepped forward and put an
arm on Gabrielle&#146;s shoulder. &quot;Excuse me, my Queen,&quot; she formally addressed
the other half of her soul, &quot;but don&#146;t you have a request to make?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#146;t think so,&quot; came the unexpected reply.</p>

<p>Xena&#146;s troubled azure eyes focused on the determined look in her
bard&#146;s face. &quot;Gabrielle, you can&#146;t fight this woman; let me be your
champion. Let me do what I do best, protect you.&quot; The pleading in her warrior&#146;s
voice caused the next sentence she spoke to catch in her throat.</p>

<p>&quot;Not this time, Xena,&quot; she whispered so only her dark hero
could hear. &quot;I must do this challenge by myself. I am capable, my love. I&#146;m not
the same young woman you intervened for with Melosa so many seasons ago. As much as I
cherish the fact that you would do this for me, I must do it for myself.</p>

<p>It was at this point that Eve stepped up and joined in the family
conversation. Gabrielle glanced over at the reigning queen and slightly shrugged her
shoulders. &quot;Family conference, sorry.&quot; Then turned her attention back to Xena
and Eve.</p>

<p>&quot;What Eve?&quot; Xena questioned.</p>

<p>&quot;Seeing how I&#146;m next in line for the throne after Mom, I
think I ought to be the one to act in the challenge as Mom&#146;s champion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hold on, the two of you.&quot; Gabrielle tried to keep from
raising her voice. &quot;Just listen to yourselves. You&#146;re talking like I don&#146;t
know a sais from a frying pan. This is my challenge and I intend to perform it
myself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gabrielle . . . &quot; Xena objected.</p>

<p>&quot;Myself!&quot; Gabrielle insisted.</p>

<p>&quot;But, Mom . . . &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No buts!&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle looked back up at the queen and shook her head. &quot;It was
necessary for us to have a family vote, &quot; she tried to joke, then cleared her throat.
&quot;Where were we?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Choice of weapons,&quot; the irritated queen answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah yes, weapons -- I think the staff would be a good
choice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The staff?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it was the first weapon I learned to wield as an Amazon. I
think it only fitting it be the weapon I use to win back my throne.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Staff it is then, Queen Gabrielle. Do you need time to practice
before the challenge?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think not.&quot; Gabrielle smiled up at the confused queen.
&quot;Do you need time to practice with the staff?&quot;</p>

<p>Not wanting to show weakness in front of the entire tribe the regent
snorted, &quot;Of course not! So . . . feast tonight sisters &#150; feast and celebrate to
welcome Gabrielle, Xena, and Eve home. The challenge will be tomorrow &#150; to see who
will be Queen of the Amazons.&quot;</p>

<p>A cry rang out from the middle of the crowd. &quot;May the best Amazon
win!&quot;</p>
