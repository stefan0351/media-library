<p>All Xena wanted to do was pick Gabrielle up and carry her to the
banquet hall, but she knew it would have embarrassed the reinstated Queen to do so and
make her look weak in front of her tribe. Instead, the warrior watched as the other half
of her soul hobbled painfully, using her staff for support, down the center of the
village, on the way to the breakfast celebration being prepared in her honor. Today would
be one continuous feast with dancing and music progressing into the wee hours of the
morning. There was nothing Amazons liked better than a reason to party, and her mate had
certainly given them that.</p>

<p>Knowing it would be nearly impossible to tear Gabrielle away from the
festivities, Xena sent Eve off to the hut to retrieve some salve for the cut knuckles and
split lip. The healing process needed to be started immediately for quickest resolution.
After all lips and hands were not injuries to be taken lightly. The raven-haired beauty
smiled inwardly as she chided herself for her twofold reasoning.</p>

<p>Gabrielle interrupted her warrior&#146;s train of thought. &quot;I
should probably get cleaned up and changed before we eat; what do you think, Xena?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It&#146;s according to how hungry you are.&quot; The champion
smiled down at her mate, knowing that the woman was more than likely famished. &quot;But,
it will probably be a while before everything is prepared; after all, it&#146;s not like
anyone stayed in the kitchen cooking while the challenge was going on. Why don&#146;t you
let me get something for you to ride in to the lake and . . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Xena, I couldn&#146;t do that!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because I&#146;m not an invalid, I&#146;m just a little bumped
up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Honestly, Gabrielle, no one will see you; we can use one of the
vegetable carts and call it a Queenly carriage.&quot; Gabrielle&#146;s warrior smiled over
at her with so much pride that the smaller woman had to smile back at the thought of being
pulled through the village in a cart.</p>

<p>It was at this point that the duo began passing occupied huts and
excited Amazons came up with congratulations and accolades to the Bard Queen. Gabrielle
did her best to smile and started to shake a sister&#146;s hand, only to have her arm
withdrawn by a strong grip. Xena firmly shook her head and told the Amazon that her Queen
needed medical attention on her hands and that any unnecessary use would deter healing.</p>

<p>&quot;Those need to be treated before you go around continuing to abuse
them, Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Xena,&quot; Gabrielle protested, &quot;these women expect to
be acknowledged.&quot;</p>

<p>Then acknowledge them with as much of a Royal grin as you can muster
out of that split lip of yours. Say thank you, and give them a regal wave.&quot; The
warrior looked silly as she demonstrated a slight hand in the air movement. Seeing the
look of humor on Gabrielle&#146;s face she took advantage of the mood and continued,
&quot;Of course you could give them the old two handed wave.&quot; Putting both hands into
the air she moved them from side-to-side, her body going in the opposite direction from
her hands. &quot;Check it out.&quot; </p>

<p>She had her lover laughing and holding her side, trying to keep from
disturbing the bruises she had received in the challenge. </p>

<p>Looking down, the warrior&#146;s face took on a solemn expression as
she seriously informed Gabrielle that fooling with open cuts was no laughing matter.
&quot;Treating those hands really is a necessity, Gabrielle. We can&#146;t have those open
wounds becoming infected.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, Shamaness, you&#146;ve made your point.&quot; The small
blonde leaned a little heavier on her lover and they continued to walk toward home. </p>

<p>&quot;You know, Xena, I think you might have a hidden reason for
getting these cuts and scratches healed,&quot; Gabrielle&#146;s eyes twinkled as she
looked up into a face bearing an arched eyebrow. &quot;Don&#146;t act innocent, my warrior
&#150; hands <b>and</B> lips &#150; what a combination to be out of commission at the same
time,&quot; Gabrielle tittered. &quot;Thank the Gods we&#146;ve been fairly affectionate
these past few days, it may be a day or two before I&#146;m able to . . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wasn&#146;t even thinking about that,&quot; Xena objected.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I think you might protest too much,&quot; the bard countered.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course it doesn&#146;t stop Me from fulfilling my promise of
last evening, now does it?&quot; Xena gave her lover a sensual look.</p>

<p>&quot;I think not!&quot; The response came quickly.</p>

<p>They continued walking and Gabrielle&#146;s limp became more apparent
with every step, and her pressure on her warrior stronger. Xena reinstated their former
conversation. &quot;Listen, Gabrielle, our hut is so far out from the village no one will
ever know if I pull you in a cart. Beside, if you don&#146;t let me pull you in something
with wheels, we will never get to the lake and back before your hungry subjects consume
the entire meal.&quot; </p>

<p>Having run out of objections, and feeling the consequences of the early
morning conflict with Tecmessa, the Queen agreed to be carted to the lake and back. She
giggled when conceding to the transportation. &quot;Oh, okay -- we&#146;ll just call it my
Royal coach.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And that would make me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My Royal Footwoman,&quot; she laughed.</p>

<p>They were coming within sight of their hut by now and Xena had a second
idea. &quot;Better yet, why don&#146;t you just ride behind me on Argo? It would be even
quicker and you wouldn&#146;t look so pitiful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Much better suggestion, Champion. I knew there was a good reason
I kept you around.&quot; With her arm around Xena&#146;s waist she was afforded the added
stability of leaning into the taller woman.</p>

<p>It lightened Xena&#146;s heart to see her bard smiling after such an
exhausting display of prowess. She was extremely proud of her Bard/Queen/Warrior, although
she didn&#146;t like thinking of Gabrielle as the latter of the three titles. In actuality
her favorite title for the small blonde was Lover and soon to be Wife. Yes, if she were to
put the four facets of her versatile soulmate in order it would be
Wife/Bard/Queen/Warrior. She tightened her hold on Gabrielle&#146;s shoulders and
whispered softly in her ear. &quot;Do you know how proud I am of you?&quot;</p>

<p>Verdant eyes looked up into sparkling sapphire eyes. &quot;I&#146;m
glad, Xena, but a challenge for the title of Queen is not something I want to make a
practice of competing in. I hope the village will be content with their Queen for a long
time to come.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m sure they will be, my love.&quot;</p>

<p>As they neared the hut, Eve met up with them, carrying the jar of
salve.</p>

<p>&quot;What took you so long?&quot; her mother asked as she took the
medicine from the outstretched hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, and you&#146;re very welcome, Mother.&quot; Eve responded
sarcastically. &quot;If you had bothered to give me the right place to look, I might have
been here sooner,&quot; she grumbled to her mother.</p>

<p>&quot;I did,&quot; Xena argued. I left it on the table the other night
after taking it out of Argo&#146;s saddlebag.</p>

<p>&quot;And I put it away . . .&quot; Gabrielle countered with a smile,
&quot; . . . As usual.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why didn&#146;t you tell me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You didn&#146;t ask. Besides if I told you every time I went
around picking up after you, we&#146;d never be able to discuss anything more than my
tidying up.&quot; She smiled sweetly at her warrior and then thanked her for being so
considerate and sending Eve for the medicine.</p>

<p>&quot;How are you feeling, Mom? You don&#146;t look very
comfortable.&quot; There was a look of concern on Eve&#146;s face as she examined the cuts
on Gabrielle&#146;s hands and face.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;ve had worse, believe me.&quot; The blonde tried to act
nonchalant, but she was most assuredly beginning to experience the reality of the
morning&#146;s activities, as her body began to stiffen and new areas of pain emerged with
each new candlemark. Come nightfall, she had a feeling that the consequences of the
day&#146;s actions would be totally realized.</p>

<p>&quot;At least Tecmessa&#146;s not feeling any better,&quot; Eve
smiled. The younger woman stood in front of her mom, wishing there were something she
could do to help ease the pain.</p>

<p>Xena opened up the jar and started to dip her finger in when Gabrielle
asked if it would be wiser to wait until after she had bathed. &quot;No, we have plenty of
this salve; let&#146;s get a little on now and I&#146;ll reapply it when you&#146;re
cleaned and changed.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle flinched as the cream was applied. It stung as it made
contact with the open areas, but within seconds the pain was ebbing from the wounds and
the bard was wishing there were a salve that could take care of bruising that easily.
&quot;That feels marvelous, Xena. Thanks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;ll check you out a little better when we have that outfit
off; you might have a few bruised ribs, and wrapping could relieve some of your
pain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;d love to stand here and chat with the two of you, but I
promised Toxaris I&#146;d help with the preparations.&quot; Eve looked at her mother
fawning over Gabrielle. &quot;I know you&#146;re in excellent hands, Mom.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, your mother is always around to pick up the pieces and help
put them back together. You go ahead and have fun with your friends. I&#146;m glad
you&#146;re getting along so well with the sisters.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I feel safe here; this was a great idea. Thanks to both of
you.&quot; She kissed Gabrielle on the cheek and then turned and did the same to Xena
before running off in the direction of the village.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess this was a good idea, huh?&quot; Xena asked.</p>

<p>&quot;This will be a very healing place for our daughter,&quot;
Gabrielle muttered as she watched Eve leave.</p>

<p>A long sharp whistle brought the beautiful palomino into view.
&quot;Come on, let&#146;s get you up on Argo.&quot; Xena gently assisted Gabrielle onto
the horse then told her she would be right back with a change of clothes, soap, and some
cloths to dry with. </p>

<p>Within minutes she was back out of the hut. &quot;We don&#146;t want to
take too long; I know you don&#146;t want to miss the meal.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;You&#146;re right on that account, Xena. Even with this sore lip,
I&#146;ll manage to get the food down. All that exercise gives the appetite a real
boost.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As if you ever need a reason to have your appetite boosted.&quot;
Xena chuckled as she got behind Gabrielle on the young horse that was quickly learning all
of her new master&#146;s idiosyncrasies. </p>

<p>The trip to the lake was a quick one via horseback, and within minutes
Gabrielle was soaking her sore muscles in the cooling water of the lake. Xena didn&#146;t
need the bath but she didn&#146;t want Gabrielle to split her knuckles any more than they
already were by overusing her hands. She stripped down and walked into the water next to
her lover.</p>

<p>&quot;Here, give me that,&quot; the warrior shook her head as she
retrieved the soap from the blonde.</p>

<p>&quot;I can wash myself,&quot; Gabrielle objected.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course you can and if you&#146;re really clever you can start
those hands to bleeding again.&quot; Sapphire eyes twinkled merrily as she lathered up one
of the sponges they had purchased from a seaman the last time they were in Potidaea.</p>

<p>&quot;This may sting a little Gabrielle, but I need to get the wounds
cleansed.&quot; Xena flinched when Gabrielle did, as she patted the knuckles with the soft
sponge. &quot;Sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#146;s not your fault. Luckily I&#146;m a fast healer; not
being able to do things with my hands is going to be the pits!&quot; The statement was
peppered with a slight grin in the direction of her Champion.</p>

<p>Pretending she hadn&#146;t heard the comment Xena made a suggestion.
&quot;Maybe you&#146;ll be forced to sit and do some writing again for a while.&quot; </p>

<p>Pleased with the idea from her mate, the small blonde smiled.
&quot;That&#146;s true, once I get my hand into the writing position, I won&#146;t have to
be changing it. I guess I should get the story of Livia/Eve written while it&#146;s still
fresh in my mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the story of the Bard Queen&#146;s return and victory over
the Regent Queen.&quot; The warrior&#146;s face was one of a proud partner when she spoke
of Gabrielle&#146;s victory.</p>

<p>&quot;You know, Xena, it was strange being out there on that field
totally alone this morning.&quot; Gabrielle put a bruised hand on each of her
champion&#146;s shoulders. &quot;You&#146;ve always been around to back me up. Xena if I
hadn&#146;t . . . &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;IF is the operative word here, my love; you did fine all by
yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but if I hadn&#146;t, you wouldn&#146;t have been able to
interfere.&quot;</p>

<p>Intent sapphire orbs focused on just as intent green ones &#150;
&quot;You don&#146;t honestly think that I would have let any major harm come to you out
there today, do you, Gabrielle?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, Xena, the rules.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To Tartarus with the rules, you are more important to me than the
rules of an Amazon village. You and Eve are the most important people in my world. We
could always find somewhere else to put down roots. I would never settle for being a widow
before becoming your consort. No! Losing you was never a viable option.&quot;</p>

<p>The blue eyes softened as they searched the face of her beloved for a
sign that Gabrielle didn&#146;t agree with her, but she found none.</p>

<p>Holding her head down and almost whispering the small bard mumbled,
&quot;I&#146;m ashamed to say that I&#146;m glad to hear you say that Xena. As much as it
would have been a death with honor, I wouldn&#146;t have wanted to leave you and Eve.
Maybe I&#146;m not as true an Amazon as I&#146;m trying to portray. You mean more to me
than the tribe. Not that I wouldn&#146;t give my life to save any one of them in a battle,
but I wouldn&#146;t want to have died this morning. We have so much left of life to
explore together, we have . . . &quot;</p>

<p>Gentle fingers barely touched the wounded lips and Gabrielle looked up
into glistening eyes that belied the warrior&#146;s hard exterior, and her heart went out
to her lover. &quot;This is just between the two of us, my soul,&quot; Xena whispered.
&quot;No one of this world need be privy to what transpires between us. Just so we know
that I would never let you die without coming to your side and that you would do the same
for me. I think we&#146;ve talked this conversation out, my bard.&quot;</p>

<p>The raven-haired beauty drew her lover close and tenderly kissed her
neck and face, carefully avoiding the bruised lips. &quot;You&#146;re my life, Gabrielle,
what would I be doing settling in a village if you weren&#146;t?&quot;</p>

<p>As is true for many bodily functions, Gabrielle&#146;s stomach took
that particular time to make an unqueenly rumbling sound that could be heard even through
the water. The lovers laughed and Xena commenced rinsing the remaining suds off the
smaller woman.</p>

<p>As they emerged from the lake, Gabrielle was just beginning to realize
how much she actually ached. Xena not only helped her dry off, but assisted her in getting
dressed. </p>

<p>&quot;Well, this should be a fun week.&quot; The newly re-appointed
Queen remarked with apparent disgust.</p>

<p>&quot;Take advantage of the newness of your position, my love. I&#146;m
sure there will be many young women who will be grateful and eager to be of help to you
around the hut until your hands heal.&quot; Xena finished helping Gabrielle on with her
top and helped her back onto Argo.</p>

<p>Jumping up behind her mate, the warrior put her arms around Gabrielle.
It was easier for her to hold the small blonde, than vice versa. This way Gabrielle
didn&#146;t have to use her arms or her sore hands. &quot;We had best get going before all
the food is devoured by those same young women I was just speaking about.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Xena it&#146;s funny, you commenting on the women that are
Eve&#146;s age. You keep calling them young women when, if you don&#146;t count the frozen
years, they aren&#146;t much younger than we are. Sometimes I still feel as though we
walked into a wonderland. Everyone who was our age is now old enough to be a parent to us,
and those who were infants, like Eve, are now seemingly our age.&quot; </p>

<p>The rest of the way to the village the two were quiet as they both
pondered on the anomaly that was now their life.</p>

<p>Upon entering the middle of the village, Argo was soon surrounded by
Amazons of all ages. They had been anxiously awaiting their Queen and her Champion, so the
mid-morning festivities could begin. Xena jumped down, then turned and reached up to help
Gabrielle dismount. </p>

<p>Even though Gabrielle had given her a bit of an argument in the
beginning, the warrior finally convinced the aching bard that wrapping the ribs would
alleviate some of the pain. She was glad her lover had surrendered to the procedure, as
getting her down off the horse would now be slightly less painful, with the tightly
wrapped bandages protecting the small blonde&#146;s bruised ribs. </p>

<p>Gabrielle&#146;s thoughts were traveling in a similar direction, while
being helped off the horse. She was exceedingly grateful that Xena had been so observant
and insisted on wrapping her ribs. Had the warrior not securely bandaged the area, she was
sure the jogging she would have received from riding astride Argo would have left her in
excruciating pain, instead of her having only moderate irritation.</p>

<p>Thoughts of pain were washed away as wonderful smells drifted through
the air, titillating the nostrils of the Bard Queen and her soon-to-be Amazon Consort.
They walked into the communal dining hall to find that no one had eaten yet; they were all
awaiting the arrival of Queen Gabrielle. A place of honor was set for three at the head of
the largest table with Xena on one side of the Queen and Eve already seated to the left of
her. The elders of the village also had seats at the Royal table. Everyone was anxiously
awaiting the arrival of the tardy duo. </p>

<p>The tables were already laden with fruits and breads. Pitchers of juice
and water were strategically placed, and as soon as Gabrielle sat down, platters of hot
foods were brought in from the cooking area; the breakfast feast officially began.</p>

<p>&quot;This is so much better than hard bread, jerky, and berries.&quot;
Gabrielle commented as she filled her plate and thanked the young woman who was doing the
serving.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, but the past few days you also had fresh fish to go along
with the stale bread,&quot; Eve reminded her mom.</p>

<p>&quot;So I did, Eve, and believe me I was grateful for that,
also.&quot; She couldn&#146;t help but notice that Toxaris was seated next to Eve. She
didn&#146;t want to form an opinion too quickly, but she noticed the far away look in her
daughter&#146;s friend&#146;s face when she looked at Eve. <i>I hope our Eve doesn&#146;t
break your heart, little Amazon,</i> Gabrielle silently mused while beginning to partake
of the breakfast feast. </p>

<p>By the time the meal was completed it was well into the afternoon and
Xena suggested that they return to the hut so that Gabrielle could take a nap before the
evening festivities began. When the smaller woman began to argue, Xena gave her &#145;the
look&#146; that meant she would not take no for an answer.</p>

<p>&quot;If you are going to heal properly, Gabrielle, you need rest.
There&#146;s nothing you can do here, anyway. Everyone has their own chores and you have
none.&quot; She smiled at her bard and slowly walked with her out of the main hall. On the
way out they stopped to talk with Eris and Rhea who were extremely excited that the
challenge had gone in favor of the bard. Rhea looked a bit tired and pallid. Xena promised
to make a poultice for the woman and bring it with her when they returned for the evening
feast. She explained to the women that Gabrielle needed to rest for a while and, once
again, Xena helped her mate to mount the palomino. There was no sense in Gabrielle walking
anywhere she didn&#146;t have to &#150; at least for the next few days. </p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;m really not that tired, Xena,&quot; Gabrielle had
objected when they were exiting the hall.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Humor me,&quot; had been the response from the dark warrior.</p>

<p>After the short jog back, they entered the hut and Gabrielle insisted
Xena lay down with her until she went to sleep. Strong arms encircled the smaller aching
body, willing comfort and healing to each area the strong yet gentle fingers touched. The
warrior hummed as she trailed her hands lightly down the Bard&#146;s back, lulling her
soulmate to a place where pain could be forgotten, if only for a few hours.</p>

<p>As soon as the warrior was positive her lover was in Morpheus&#146;
realm, she cautiously unwound the blonde&#146;s arms from around her body and slipped
quietly from the bed.</p>

<p>Now, standing looking down at the sleeping bard, Xena knew it had been
a good idea to have the newly reinstated Queen get some needed rest before the
evening&#146;s festivities began. She blew her a kiss and went about making the promised
poultice for Rhea.</p>

<p>Xena busied herself around the outside of the hut, gathering the
ingredients she didn&#146;t already have for the poultice, grooming the horses and cutting
down some of the brush that the Amazon sisters had neglected around the porch. When she
was quite finished playing Shamaness and blacksmith, she sat and sharpened her sword, a
luxury she hadn&#146;t the time the last few days to engage in. The sun was beginning to
recede toward the horizon before the raven-haired beauty decided it was time to awaken her
Bard. If they were going to attend the festivities, they had best get ready. It was a
wonder Gabrielle had been able to sleep throughout the entire day, with all the drumming
that had been keeping pace with the excited Amazons, but that further acknowledged that
the warrior had been right and that her partner was in obvious need of the rest.</p>

<p>&quot;Good evening, Starshine, you&#146;ve just about slept the day
away.&quot; Xena whispered, as she reclined next to her lover. She studied the peaceful
face, before running her long fingers through the silky locks.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Xena, is it really that late? I can see the shadows on the
walls.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Actually it seems as though you&#146;ve slept from breakfast
directly through to dinner.&quot; The warrior smiled tenderly down on the face of her
angel, as she watched the sea-green eyes blink away the sleep. &quot;Did you dream?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, I don&#146;t think I ever sleep without dreaming. It
must be the curse of the bard, or perhaps the gift; I&#146;m not sure which. At least I
didn&#146;t relieve the entire challenge as I thought I might. Morpheus was kind to me
today; he allowed me to dream of our joining. Did you say I slept through dinner?&quot;
There was panic in the bard&#146;s voice.</p>

<p>&quot;I was only kidding; you know I wouldn&#146;t allow that.
You&#146;d never let me live it down. So did you plan the entire wedding in your sleep, my
soul?&quot; Xena raised an eyebrow as she awaited the response.</p>

<p>&quot;No. I wouldn&#146;t do that . . . I wouldn&#146;t plan everything
without including you.&quot;</p>

<p>With a sarcastic smile the warrior kissed her mate on the cheek.
&quot;Oh, but we all know that, Gabrielle. You wouldn&#146;t think of starting anything
without first discussing it with me, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#146;t know about not starting, Xena.&quot; Gabrielle
confessed. &quot;But I certainly would include you as things went along.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You had best include me in Everything, my little bard. I want no
surprises on my wedding day. Do you understand? We need to sit down, you and I, and talk
about the ceremony, until we both agree on how it is to be played out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you getting cold feet, my warrior?&quot; Gabrielle smiled,
sitting up and now fully awake.</p>

<p>&quot;No, not cold feet, but I don&#146;t want any surprises. I want to
know just what it is we will be promising. I never thought I would be settling down like
this Gabrielle. I want to feel comfortable with the vows.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand, Xena. I was just kidding with you. We do need to
sit and talk about how we want to handle the vows and who we want standing up for
us.&quot; A slight melancholy looked cross the bard&#146;s soft eyes, and they veiled over
for an instant.</p>

<p>&quot;A dinar for your thoughts, Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p>The bard shrugged her shoulders and shook her head. &quot;It&#146;s
nothing, really.&quot;</p>

<p>The dark-haired woman tilted the small face before her until their eyes
were locked in a lover's stare. Through the piercing green eyes, the warrior searched the
other half of her soul, and her heart found the question that was patiently awaiting her
response.</p>

<p>&quot;You want to go home before the wedding, don&#146;t you
Gabrielle?&quot;</p>

<p>The tears in her lover&#146;s eyes spoke the answer long before the
slightly pouting lips were able to reply. &quot;I always thought Lila would be my maid of
honor if we ever took the vows,&quot; the bard sighed.</p>

<p>&quot;And you think that&#146;s too difficult a request to have
granted?&quot; Xena placed a hand under her soul mate&#146;s chin and lifted the face of
her angel to meet her gaze. &quot;Gabrielle, if you want to go get Lila we can start as
soon as your ribs heal. We can talk about the plans along the way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What if she&#146;s . . . not alive?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since when did you become the pessimist? I thought that was my
job? I&#146;m sure Lila is alive and as ornery as ever. She probably even has a cottage
full of kids.&quot; Xena chuckled at the thought of the feisty young girl having grown
into motherhood.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#146;s going to be weird seeing my baby sister looking like my
elder.&quot; Gabrielle didn&#146;t know whether to smile or cry when she thought about the
years of memories that had been denied her. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Xena, Lila isn&#146;t the only one I want at the wedding.&quot;</p>

<p>Now it was the warrior&#146;s turn to become serious. &quot;Gabrielle
you don&#146;t think your parents will want to attend?&quot; It was more of a statement
than a question.</p>

<p>&quot;Xena, I&#146;m not even sure if my parents are alive &#150; they
were not that young when we went into hibernation. But, no . . . I wasn&#146;t thinking of
My parents . . . I want Cyrene there.&quot;</p>

<p>It was now also the warrior&#146;s turn to have doubts about going
home. She had been comfortable enough with taking Gabrielle home to Potidaea, but
returning to Amphipolis was a different story. She tried not to think of the fact that
Cyrene could very well be dead. And Toris . . . she didn&#146;t know if he had stayed in
the city or not. &quot;Don&#146;t you think we should talk about this a little more?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No. Xena this is perhaps the most important step in either of our
lives,&quot; she chuckled and shook her head. &quot;Well, maybe coming back from the dead
might have been a little more important or fighting Gods and Goddesses for our lives, that
might have taken second place, but you know what I mean!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Gabrielle, I know what you mean.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#146;s important for us now, and I don&#146;t think I want to
wait until after the wedding to see if our families have survived the past 25 years. The
wedding will be at least a moon in the preparations. Xena help me. I&#146;m
rambling.&quot; The blonde looked pathetically up into almost sorrowful sapphire eyes that
knew the same ache to find out who was still alive in their immediate families. </p>

<p>Xena simply nodded affirmatively, giving Gabrielle the acknowledgment
she desired. &quot;We&#146;ll leave just as soon as you can ride your own horse without
pain.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Xena.&quot; The small blonde put her head on her
champion&#146;s chest and hugged her close. &quot;I think we should ask Eve if she would
like to come along and meet her aunt and grandmother and maybe even her uncle and
cousins.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Eve should have that option. We can talk about it more in
the morning, right now you need to get dressed; I can smell the food and that means
it&#146;s almost time to eat.&quot;</p>

<p>After re-wrapping Gabrielle&#146;s ribs and putting more salve on the
bard&#146;s hands and lips, Xena helped her lover finish dressing. When they were ready to
walk out the door she reminded Gabrielle that both the ceremonial staff and mask should be
taken, for the ceremony that was certain to ensue this evening. Xena had shined up her
chakram as well as her sword, while Gabrielle was sleeping and they were both in their
respective holders. </p>

<p>&quot;We might as well ride Argo into the village, arriving like a
Queen will add a nice touch.&quot; The dark-haired beauty lifted her soul mate up onto the
horse, as she had before and before getting on herself, raced back into the hut and
retrieved a small bulging bag she almost forgot. When she came out again, Xena situated
herself behind her mate and took Argo&#146;s reins. </p>

<p>Within minutes they were gathering attention as they neared the great
hall where the banquet was being held. Gabrielle could tell that it was going to be a long
evening and she leaned back and thanked Xena for allowing her to sleep and to rest up for
the festivities.</p>

<p>The warrior simply kissed her bard on the golden crown and then leaned
over and whispered into the small ear. &quot;That&#146;s what Royal Consorts are for, My
Queen, to make sure you are taken care of properly.&quot; Her tongue played a round of
ring around the ear, causing Gabrielle to shiver and smile as she leaned back into her
lover&#146;s body.</p>

<p>&quot;If you don&#146;t stop, we will find ourselves leaving and
heading back from whence we just came, my warrior!&quot; Gabrielle giggled.</p>

<p>&quot;I think not, my bard &#150; your body is in no condition to
undergo what I would expect from you, if we left these festivities and went home.&quot;
She walked Argo over to the large building and dismounted. She then held out her arms to
Gabrielle, lifting the smaller woman down from the horse.</p>

<p>The Amazons lined up on either side of their Queen and her Champion as
they walked toward the banquet hall. Inside, the room had been gaily decorated and there
was a small group of musicians over in one corner performing on drums, reed, and string
instruments. </p>

<p>Gabrielle smiled at the musicians as she caught each of their glances
in her direction. The couple then continued on to their place of honor at the end of the
table. The throne-like chairs had been pulled away from the table in anticipation of the
short ceremony that was planned to take place before the dining would begin.</p>

<p>Tecmessa met them at the head of the table, her own mask firmly in
place, as were the masks of the Amazons surrounding her. This would be an extremely
unusual ceremony with the defeated queen regent being the officiating sister.</p>

<p>&quot;Bard Queen Gabrielle,&quot; Tecmessa began as Gabrielle stood
facing the village of Amazons that were still filling the large room. &quot;We are here to
honor and welcome you back as Queen of your tribe.&quot; She reached out and took
Gabrielle&#146;s mask while at the same time another of the sisters took her staff. The
two Amazons stood in front of Gabrielle and Xena, patiently waiting until a third masked
Amazon joined them.</p>

<p>It was at this point that they all turned and faced the crowd. </p>

<p>Tecmessa spoke to a now hushed gathering. &quot;Sister Amazons, we are
here to reinstate our Bard Queen Gabrielle who has for too long been absent, through no
fault of her own, from this tribe.&quot; She motioned the woman to the left of her to step
forward.</p>

<p>&quot;Phillippis has for the last season been the faithful keeper of
the Bard Queen&#146;s staff, our Queen&#146;s symbol of warriorhood.&quot;</p>

<p>Phillippis held the staff high above her head for all to see and the
crowd was silent.</p>

<p>Tecmessa continued. &quot;This Amazon has protected and cherished the
staff in our Queen&#146;s absence, and tonight gratefully places the weapon back into the
hands of its rightful owner.&quot;</p>

<p>Phillippis turned and faced Gabrielle. She relinquished the staff to
the Queen, placed her right fist to her heart and bowed as she stepped back two paces to
stand again beside the new leader of the Royal Guard.</p>

<p>Tecmessa now motioned to the woman on her right to step forward.</p>

<p>&quot;Aello has for the last season been the faithful keeper of the
Bard Queen&#146;s quill, our Queen&#146;s symbol of her ability to weave the spoken word
into that of the written word so that all Amazons may be able to know the stories.&quot;</p>

<p>The proud Amazon turned and faced Gabrielle. She relinquished the quill
to the Queen, placed her right fist to her heart and bowed as she stepped back two paces
to stand again beside the new leader of the Royal Guard.</p>

<p>Finally, Tecmessa held high the Queen&#146;s Mask. &quot;By the
authority granted to me by the council this afternoon, I now reinstate the Bard Queen
Gabrielle to her rightful station as Queen of the Amazons. A title she not only deserves
by cast but by deed as a warrior. Never before has the tribe been lead by such a versatile
woman, one who is as easily at home with a pot, a quill or a staff in tow. She will lead
the tribe with strength, honor and compassion.&quot; </p>

<p>The former regent turned and faced Gabrielle. She relinquished the mask
to her Queen, placed her right fist to her heart and bowed as she stepped back two paces
to stand again between the other two Royal Guard Amazons.</p>

<p>Gabrielle stood with Xena by her side. She handed her Champion her
staff and quill, allowing her to hold her Queen&#146;s mask high above her head with one
hand on either side of it. Then slowly and with conviction she placed the mask of Queen
upon her face.</p>

<p>The crowd went wild and a thundering cheer rolled through the room,
shaking the timbers of the large hall . . . &quot;Queen Gabrielle! Queen Gabrielle! Long
Live Queen Gabrielle.&quot;</p>

<p>Xena stood by watching, pride lighting up her face. The small blonde
allowed the excitement to flow for a few minutes and then, motioning with her hands,
dulled the sound to a whisper and then to silence. She took off the mask and placed it on
the throne behind her then turned to address her subjects. </p>

<p>&quot;Amazons &#150; we are gathered here in celebration, but this is
more than just a ceremony of my reinstatement as your Queen. We are gathered here as a
once divided nation, now reunited. My dream is to see all the Amazons joined into a strong
sisterhood. There should never be a village anywhere in the known world that each and
every one of you is not welcomed in. We will take our stand for justice and it will be our
duty to watch out for and support any woman, Amazon or not, who asks for our help. When
all women are safe in their homes and free from tyranny, only then will we all be Free!
Hail to the Amazons &#150; defenders of women!&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Hail to the Amazons &#150; defenders of women,&quot; became the
cry from the sisters.</p>

<p>Now it was Xena&#146;s turn to raise her hands and ask for silence.
While the congregation was calming down she turned and retrieved one golden and one silver
goblet from the bag she had carried from the hut. Picking up a pitcher of wine from the
table she filled each of the goblets, placed them on the table and faced the now silent
throng. </p>

<p>&quot;Amazons &#150; I have been among you for many years, longer than
some of you are old and even longer than your reigning Queen. For all these seasons I have
denied, not my association with your nation, but becoming a member of the Amazons. Today
there are two subjects close to my heart that I would like to acknowledge. The first of
the two matters has to do with the re-coronation of Gabrielle as your Queen. I would like
to commend the tribe, as I feel you could have made no finer a choice for a leader,
especially when looking for attributes of both courage and mercy. Secondly I would like to
officially join the ranks of the Amazons in the most auspicious way possible.&quot;</p>

<p>Gabrielle stood staring at the statuesque beauty before her, mesmerized
by her style and grace, as were the rest of the women sitting and standing in the huge
room. All of them were trying to calculate in what direction Xena was going with her
speech.</p>

<p>The raven-haired warrior stepped back and took her lover&#146;s hand as
she knelt on one strong knee. She reached behind her and unsheathing her sword held it,
palms up in front of Gabrielle to take. I offer you my sword, and my life. Placing her
right hand over her heart she beseeched . . . &quot;Gabrielle . . . my lover . . . my
lifemate . . . the completion of my soul . . . will you join with me in a Royal Ceremony .
. . be my wife and make me your Royal Amazon Consort?&quot; </p>

<p>Gabrielle, her brilliant green eyes filled to overflowing with tears of
joy, took the sword and lightly touched each of Xena&#146;s shoulders, commanding her to
rise. Handing the sword back to the warrior who quickly replaced it into its sheath, the
small blonde stepped closer and took her Champion&#146;s hand. </p>

<p>&quot;My answer, of course, is yes, my love.&quot;</p>

<p>A deafening cheer spread throughout the hall until the small Queen
silenced the Amazons with her hands. &quot;Looks like there will be preparations for a
Royal Joining,&quot; she smiled at her sisters as the cheering began anew. </p>

<p>With joined hands the newly betrothed couple approached the table. Xena
picked up the two goblets and handed one to Gabrielle. Without need of encouragement, a
hush fell over the hall.</p>

<p>&quot;These are ceremonial goblets stolen long ago from the cities of
Amphipolis and Potidaea &#150; the Silver belonged to my home of birth and the gold to
that of your Queen&#146;s. Warlords, who have long since died, pilfered them. I took them
back from the thieves, and until a day ago they had remained entombed. Tonight, as we
drink from the goblets of bride-to-be our ancestors, we shall look to a bright future
among the Amazons.&quot; She toasted her and the couple drank in celebration of their
announcement. The clamor of the sisters was almost deafening.</p>

<p>Gabrielle put her goblet down and stepped closer to her warrior.
&quot;By the Gods Xena that was beautiful &#150; thank you my love!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never say there is no romance in my blood, my soul,&quot; the
champion whispered back.</p>

<p>Without trying to subdue the crowd this time, Gabrielle faced the front
of the table and stated simply, in as loud a voice as she could muster &#150;
&quot;Let&#146;s Eat . . . Let the Celebration begin!&quot;</p>

<p>No sooner were the words spoken than the women chosen to serve, raced
to the cooking area and started filling trays with all the delicacies that had been
prepared throughout the course of the day. One of the entrees that had been simmering for
candlemarks was a delightful rabbit stew, chock full of vegetables from gardens of some of
the older Amazons, who no longer went on the hunting expeditions. There were plates piled
high with deer steaks and potatoes as well as loaves of fresh bread. Sitting in the
kitchen as a special surprise were round little dumpling-like pastries filled with sweet
red stuff and made exactly like Gabrielle had taught some of the women to make the last
time she and her warrior had been here, 25 full seasons ago when Eve was a baby. The
recipe had now been handed down to a new generation, and the small treats were still
enjoyed at all the celebrations.</p>

<p>Throughout the feeding frenzy people kept coming up and congratulating
the lucky couple. Xena sat there wondering if she had done the right thing proposing in
front of the entire Amazon community, but when she looked over at Gabrielle and saw how
she radiated happiness the silent warrior vowed that she would do it all over again if
need be. Smiling inwardly she reminded herself that they still had the actual ceremony to
go through and what a &#145;gladiator day in Rome&#146; that was going to be. </p>

<p>Throughout the evening one or the other of her mothers would
occasionally receive an approving look from Eve. She even made sure to talk to each of
them, both separately and together, but they steered clear of discussing the forthcoming
trip Amphipolis and Potidaea.</p>

<p>After a while the entire party began shifting to the open air, as the
musicians took their melodies out where there was room for dancing. </p>

<p>Again there was a special place reserved for the Queen and her
Champion. It was obvious to anyone who watched Gabrielle walk from the dining hall to the
outside area that the Queen would definitely be only a spectator during the evening&#146;s
festivities. There may have been a smile on her face and a twinkle in her eyes, but there
was definitely pain in her movement. </p>

<p>&quot;I&#146;ll be right there,&quot; Gabrielle told Xena as they left
the hall. &quot;I have something I want to do first.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Want me to come with?&quot; Xena asked, unsure of where her bard
was going.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I&#146;ll only be a few minutes,&quot; Gabrielle assured her
dark hero. &quot;You go on ahead.&quot;</p>

<p>While Xena made her way through the crowd of Amazons to their seats of
honor, Gabrielle meandered in the opposite direction over to where Tecmessa was standing
with some of her friends. After catching the woman&#146;s eye, Gabrielle motioned that she
wanted to speak with her privately.</p>

<p>&quot;Tecmessa, I just want to thank your for the lovely way you headed
the ceremony tonight. I would think that to be a difficult chore after such a recent
loss.&quot;</p>

<p>The taller woman nodded to her Queen and smiled. &quot;If you were to
stop and really think about it Queen Gabrielle, had I lost that challenge to any other of
my sisters, I would not have been alive tonight to hand them their mask. Not only did you
spare my life, but you, also, gave me a place of honor in your guard. You have a friend
for life in me, my Queen.&quot; Tecmessa patted her heart with her right hand and bowed
her head slightly in reverence.</p>

<p>&quot;Enough of that when we talking privately, Tecmessa.&quot; The
blonde blushed slightly at the compliment she had just been paid. It had come from the
heart she was sure, and she was glad that the two of them would be friends.
&quot;I&#146;ll let you rejoin your friends; I just wanted to thank you.&quot; </p>

<p>Gabrielle began walking back toward her seat of honor. She glanced
around at the bonfire and over at the dancers and musicians, but Xena was nowhere to be
seen. She figured her dark warrior had wanted a few private minutes alone. After all,
large parties still made her champion nervous, even when they were in her bard&#146;s
honor.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">********************</p>
</B>

<p>Xena decided that a little quite time might be just what she needed.
She felt if she could steal away into the woods for a few minutes while Gabrielle was off
talking to whomever, that maybe her nerves would calm a little after opening her heart in
front of the entire Amazon Nation &#150; or at least a good hunk of it. She needed a break
from all the congratulations being given by nearly every Amazon in the village. </p>

<p>Just beyond the light of the fire the drums took on a duller tone. The
tall warrior stood in the light of the silver moon, gazing up into the stars and feeling
quite content with herself. It pleased her to know how happy she had made her soul this
evening, both the one that resided in her body and the other half that resided in the body
of her bard.</p>

<p>There was a slight crackling sound emanating from the left of her. Out
of instinct she reached for her chakram, then heard a giggle. &quot;Way to go Warrior
Babe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aphrodite?! What are you doing here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I told the Little Bard that I was watching out for Artemis&#146;
chosen, now that she no longer can. And since my favorite mortal happens to be one of
them, what better place for me to pop in occasionally.&quot; She closed the gap between
herself and the warrior and continued. &quot;Xena that was quite a romantic interlude
there amidst all those Amazons. A bit out of character for you, but lovely
nonetheless.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I only did it for Gabrielle. I figured she would appreciate
it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well let me tell you &#150; I appreciated it also. Anything that
laced with love makes me tingle all over, and for doing that I will grant you one wish
gratis anytime you want to make it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks Aphrodite, I&#146;d like to think on it for a while.
Wouldn&#146;t want to waste such a precious commodity. &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No hurry, Xena. I plan on being around for quite some time. Will
I get an invitation to the joining?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, if you want.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure I want; I love weddings! I&#146;ll even give the two of you
an instant trip to your grotto as a wedding present for your honeymoon . . . or wherever
you want to go for that matter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks again, Aphrodite.&quot; </p>

<p>Realizing that Gabrielle might start worrying about where she was she
asked the Goddess if she would like to come back to the celebration with her.</p>

<p>&quot;No, thanks. I just wanted to compliment you on your lovely
proposal. After all you only do something like that once in a lifetime, might as well make
it spectacular. And no one could say that you ever did anything that wasn&#146;t
spectacular, now could they Xena?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Guess not.&quot; The warrior agreed with the Goddess of Love.</p>

<p>&quot;Listen, Warrior Babe, give my little friend a big hello from me,
and tell her I&#146;ll be keeping an occasional eye on the two of you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just be careful when you decide to pop in Goddess of Love,&quot;
the warrior teased. &quot;There are times when being alone is exactly how we want to
remain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I get the picture, Xena. Now, I have an appointment for a facial
so I&#146;ll catch ya later.&quot;</p>

<p>With that the Goddess of Love was off in a blink of an eye, leaving
only the sprinkling of gold and pink dust behind as she disappeared as quickly as she had
arrived.</p>

<p>Xena took a deep breath and slowly made her way back into the midst of
the festivities. It didn&#146;t take long to spot Gabrielle sitting above the crowd,
watching the women dance. Going back into the hall, the warrior retrieved the goblets and
filled them with wine before joining her lover.</p>

<p>&quot;Where did you disappear to?&quot; Gabrielle wanted to know as she
reached out and took the offered goblet.</p>

<p>&quot;Just went for a minute of quiet thought out in the woods.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Alone?&quot; Gabrielle wanted to know.</p>

<p>&quot;It wouldn&#146;t have been quiet if I took someone with me, now
would it have been?&quot; She shook her head and smiled sweetly over at her lover.
&quot;But, I did meet up with a friend of yours while I was out there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really? Who?&quot; Now she really had Gabrielle&#146;s attention.</p>

<p>&quot;The Goddess of Love.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aphrodite was in the woods? Whatever for?&quot; Questioning green
eyes focused on her lover&#146;s face.</p>

<p>&quot;She came to congratulate me on proposing to you in front of the
entire village. She thought is was extremely romantic.&quot; </p>

<p>The look of pride on her warrior&#146;s face was so sincere; it warmed
the bard&#146;s heart.</p>

<p>&quot;And so it was Xena. I was shocked. Thrilled, but shocked.&quot;
The bard tried to smile but her cracked lips prevented a full grin.</p>

<p>Catching the grimace on the fair face in front of her, Xena reached
into the small bag she had attached to her leathers and brought out the salve she had been
putting on Gabrielle&#146;s cuts.</p>

<p>&quot;Xena, that&#146;s not necessary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really? Then why don&#146;t you just give me a great big grin, my
Queen? Come on, an ear-to-ear smile.&quot;</p>

<p>Knowing that her champion was right, Gabrielle yielded to letting Xena
cover her lips with the soothing cream. </p>

<p>&quot;When do you think we should ask Eve if she wants to go with us to
Amphipolis and Potidaea?&quot; Gabrielle asked, while Xena was putting the salve away.</p>

<p>&quot;As soon as we get the chance. Give her a few days to make up her
mind and then she can help us get everything ready to travel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On the trip there we won&#146;t have to take much. The grotto is
less than a full day&#146;s ride. But we do need to get a horse for Eve if she decides on
coming with us. I hope she does.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do, too, Gabrielle, just in case Mother isn&#146;t in good
enough health to make the trip back here to the village. At least she&#146;d get to spend
a little time with her granddaughter and Eve with her grandmother.&quot; Remembering a
portion of her conversation with the Goddess of Love, Xena thought she had better fill
Gabrielle in while she was thinking about it. &quot;By the way, Aphrodite wants to be
invited to the joining.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She wants to be . . . &quot; Gabrielle plopped into her seat.</p>

<p>&quot;I think the Goddess of Love has adopted you, Queen of the
Amazons.&quot; Xena smiled as she sat down next to her lover.</p>

<p>Gabrielle took a drink of her wine and then proceeded to examine the
goblet she held in her hand. &quot;Is this really from Potidaea?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure is. Look around on the other side you&#146;ll notice the
mascot of your little city. I collected these treasures quite a while ago my love, before
we met. When we were rummaging around in the treasure trove the other day I spotted them
and was happy I had left them at that particular spot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No coincidences, remember Xena? There&#146;s a reason for
everything.&quot; Gabrielle lifted her glass to toast her warrior. &quot;To the love of my
life. I know you are just as thrilled about all the preparations that will now have to be
made for the Royal Wedding as I am.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thrilled is an understatement, my love, an absolute
understatement,&quot; the warrior acknowledged as she took a large gulp of her wine.</p>

<p>The moon had risen high in the night sky and was now beginning to make
it descent when the bard and her warrior decided they had stayed long enough to be
sociable and could easily slip away and retire to their hut.</p>

<p>After gently placing Gabrielle on Argo, Xena joined her and they
trotted off toward their home with little attention from the partying Amazons.</p>

<p>&quot;You know, my love,&quot; Xena began after they had dismounted and
began walking up to the porch steps. &quot;I promised to make last night up to you, after
you were reinstated as Queen, but I really think we ought to conserve your energy for a
few days.&quot; Still standing on the ground she placed the staff, quill, and mask on the
deck of the porch, then started to ascend the stairs.</p>

<p>&quot;As much as I hate to agree with you on that count, Xena, I
do.&quot; The bard turned around at the top of the stairs and put her hands on her
lover&#146;s shoulders. Only in positions such as this did she get the chance to look down
into the beautiful face that could start her blood to heating and send chills up and down
her spine. The angle of the moon was such that its glow lit up and softened the angular
features of her beautiful warrior. Dazzling sapphire eyes shone brightly as they gazed up
into the fair face of a golden angel.</p>

<p>&quot;If you stand looking at me with those emeralds of yours much
longer, my soul, I will find it almost impossible to keep my body from doing what my mind
knows it shouldn&#146;t tonight.&quot;</p>

<p>The corners of Gabrielle&#146;s mouth slightly curled into a tiny
smile, and her eyes took on an iridescent glow as she slowly lowered her face toward that
of her lover. It mattered not that the kiss would be as painful as it was sweet, she could
not let this moment slip by without taking advantage of the full lips as they reached up
to meet her own.</p>

<p>Xena cautiously ran her tongue over the outside of Gabrielle&#146;s
lips, wishing silently that the mere touch of her tongue would be able to heal the wounded
skin. &quot;I love you, my soul,&quot; the dark hero whispered before allowing her tongue
entrance between the damaged lips. </p>

<p>&quot;I love you more,&quot; came the answer from the other half of her
heart, as Gabrielle opened her mouth to allow the soft, warm tongue of her lover inside. </p>

<p>With their lips still joined, the tall warrior carefully encircled her
arms around the bard as she climbed to the next step. Then, picking the smaller woman up,
she placed one foot and then the other on the deck of the porch. Without missing a step
she carried her beloved to and beyond the threshold of their home, then closed the door
behind them. </p>

<p>Xena placed Gabrielle on the bed and began undoing the bard&#146;s
clothing, not stopping until her lover was lying naked on the bed in front of her. Quickly
she stood and stepped out of her own clothes, then crawled back onto the bed to envelop
the warm body awaiting her. &quot;I&#146;ll be gentle, Gabrielle, I promise. Please
don&#146;t tell me I can&#146;t take you tonight.&quot; </p>

<p>The plea that was evident in the soft contralto voice caused a lump to
form in the throat of the bard as she searched for a reply. </p>

<p>&quot;All the tea in Chin couldn&#146;t stop me from allowing you to
continue, my love. My body silently screams for your touch.&quot; She sat up slightly to
allow the warrior to gently remove the bandage she had wrapped around her ribs earlier in
the evening. The few glasses of wine Gabrielle imbibed during the feast anesthetized her
to the throbbing pain that had followed her throughout the day. All her mind could focus
on at this minute was the tall, muscular body leaning over her, smelling of musk mixed
already with the sweet odor of desire.</p>

<p>As accustomed as she was to lying on top of her bard, the warrior
tonight lay beside her instead. Fingers that had a propensity to occasionally be rough
were, in this early morning rendezvous, slow and gentle as they stroked the slightly
bruised body of her bard. Her lips tenderly caressed the abused areas and then traveled on
to where the outcome of the challenge showed no signs.</p>

<p>Slipping easily between her lover&#146;s thighs, Xena parted the golden
rimmed nether lips with her tongue, only to find what her heart had known all along would
be there to greet her. A pool of the nectar of love awaited, and the warrior&#146;s
appetite increased as she sucked the delicate nub, smiling as it hardened under her
expertise. </p>

<p>Soft moans came from the vicinity far above her head and the warrior
took pride in knowing that both parts of her soul would be totally satisfied before the
need for sleep would overtake the two. Restraint was the order of the early morning ritual
and the warrior stopped herself more than once from proceeding too vigorously as she
concentrated on keeping her movements to a minimum and her pace slow.</p>

<p>&quot;Xena . . . oooh . . . y-e-s . . . please . . . &quot; Half
phrases, sighs, and moans punctuated the utterances that were merely spoken fragments of
the small blonde&#146;s thoughts and feelings.</p>

<p>&quot;I know, my soul,&quot; the warrior whispered. &quot;There . . .
is that what you want?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-e-s . . . oh . . . Xena . . . Gods . . . ah!&quot; A small hand
extended searching fingers to touch the tip of the black curly mound, situated almost out
of reach. &quot;I want to touch you Xena . . . please,&quot; the blonde pleaded, and her
mate responded by inching closer and allowing the eager digits to find their way to the
yearning deep inside the champion, as they slid ever so easily within, to play among the
walls of passion. A solitary thumb engaged itself on the swollen bud outside the walls,
helping to raise the intensity of the dark warrior&#146;s intoxication. </p>

<p>Finally, kneeling and continuing to allow her lover access to her own
longing, Xena advanced the orchestration of an undulating dance of love, maintaining a
slow and steady rhythm . . . slow and steady . . . slow and steady. </p>

<p>&quot;Come for me Gabrielle. Let me feel the pulsating inside your body
match that of my heart.&quot; </p>

<p>With a unhurried and deliberate pace, combined with the perfect amount
of pressure, the warrior not only succeeded in bringing her soulmate to an exquisite
climax, but she managed to achieve her own satisfaction as well, as she watched her
lover&#146;s body move in a cadence that matched her own. Instead of speeding up the act
of love as she normally did when the anticipation of orgasm was evident, she filled the
recesses of her lover more fully than ever before and added pressure on the sensitive
areas, causing her bard to come both inside and out simultaneously.</p>

<p>&quot;By the . . . Xena . . .&quot; The last of the words were cut off
when a warm mouth, as tenderly as possible in the height of ecstasy, covered the small
bard&#146;s mouth. Xena&#146;s tongue was allowed entrance and there was not one cell in
the blonde&#146;s body that did not experience the rapture of Heaven on Earth.</p>

<p>Lying spent beside the love of her life, the raven-haired beauty, her
dark locks drenched in sweat, rolled onto her back and coaxed the small blonde into her
most common sleeping position. The warmth of Gabrielle&#146;s skin touching hers sent
shivers of devotion through her body.</p>

<p>&quot;Will sleep be a difficult venture this morning, my love,&quot;
Xena questioned in a teasing tone.</p>

<p>&quot;I believe you already know the answer to that, as I will be in
Morpheus&#146; realm probably before you start snoring,&quot; Gabrielle teased back.
&quot;We have so much to talk about Xena . . .&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hush, Gabrielle. Don&#146;t even start. Let your mind remained
fixed on what just transpired. We&#146;ll allow the world back in when the sun greets us
after a few candlemarks of sleep. Goodnight, my soul, sleep tight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Goodnight Xena, I love you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love you, too, Gabrielle.&quot; Those were the last words
spoken, before the lovers surrendered their bodies and their minds to the realm of the God
of Dreams.</p>
