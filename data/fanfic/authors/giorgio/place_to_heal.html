<p>The path they took was leading them back toward the village of the Northern
Amazons. Gabrielle promised Xena it would be a good place for healing, knowing
in her heart that there would probably be conflict there as well as any place
else the three of them were to travel in these times of change. Not many of
the Amazons they knew and loved were still alive and the younger generation
may have forgotten about them, or worse hated Eve and maybe even Xena for having
killed Artemis. Still, Gabrielle's status as Queen and Eve's as her successor
could not be denied ... challenged maybe ... but not denied. Gabrielle knew
there would be an initial uneasiness and perhaps even resentment from her Amazon
sisters. If they could amend any hard feelings the tribe harbored for them,
then the Village would be an excellent place for the trio to heal, from both
the physical and emotional wounds they, as yet, found themselves unable or unwilling
to discuss.</p>
<p>The walk along the beach was one of quiet retrospection. Silence prevailed through
most of the morning, with each component of the trio being bathed in her own
thoughts. When they turned from the water's edge and entered the dense forest,
Gabrielle continued to relive in her mind the events of the past few moons,
such as the sorrowful joy at finding an aged Joxer, and the devastation at losing
him again, only this time to death. The only thing about that fateful day and
those that followed that had been discussed in any length was the friendship
Aphrodite had shown toward the bard. Xena felt that the golden-haired beauty
deserved to know how deeply the Goddess of Love cared for her. It gave Gabrielle
solace to know the Goddess who always seemed like a friend, in actuality was.
</p>
<p>Talk of the betrayal, due to the mental meddling of the Furies, was avoided
as was the mortal blow Gabrielle received at the hand of the person least likely
in the entire world to hurt the fair-haired beauty. The bard realized that for
them to leap these hurdles and then continue on with their lives, talk needed
to be instigated and soon. <i>When we reach the village and Eve is safe from
vigilantes, then Xena and I will also have a little peace and not have to continually
look over our shoulders for someone trying to avenge a relative, friend, or
village.</i></p>
<p>&quot;Maybe you'll get a chance to do some writing when we get settled into
the village.&quot; A gentle contralto voice interrupted Gabrielle's thoughts.</p>
<p>She looked up into caring blue eyes that always seemed to match the blue they
were nearest to; today it was the sky. &quot;That would be nice, it's been a
while and there is a lot to record. Feeling safe for a while will be a luxury
for us, and being among family and friends . . . I've almost forgotten what
that feels like.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We could go to Poteidaia first if you want. You haven't seen your . .
.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot; . . . Baby sister who's now close to 25 years my senior? My parents who
I'm sure are no longer alive? Xena we have people to grieve for, who remain
in our hearts and minds just as we left them 25 years ago. Even now when I think
of Joxer and Meg, my first impression is not of the couple we came back to find,
but of the individuals we left behind during our timeless hibernation. Until
I get my life ... our life ... back on track, I can't think of going to see
Lila.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're right, Gabrielle. Even the Amazons have lived a lifetime since
we last saw them and here we are having aged only moons. I'm also worried about
how they will accept Eve back into the village; after all it was because of
her that Artemis was killed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But
she didn't do the actual killing Xena, you did. It was by your hand that their
protector died.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's true.&quot; A pensive look came over the warrior's face as she
looked down at her bard.</p>
<p>&quot;Where do we go from here?&quot; Gabrielle asked to no one in particular.
&quot;The Amazons will never accept the power that instigated the downfall of
their Gods.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Since some of the Gods were spared, maybe one of them will take Artemis'
place within the Nation,&quot; Xena offered. &quot;I guess we'll have to initiate
a policy of 'one day at a time', it's the only practical way to handle our lives
at this point.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Xena,&quot; Gabrielle smiled hoping to lighten the grave look on her warrior's
face. &quot;I do believe that's the way we've always lived.&quot; She received
the desired response as Xena smiled and proceeded to put a strong arm around
her shoulder. A gentle touch grazed the area where the chakram had hit the bard
week's ago and Gabrielle wondered how they were ever going to breach that conversation.
<i>Just ask her why! It's the simplest and most direct route. You know you're
not good at direct, but maybe this time you need to try.</i></p>
<p>Xena pulled her close and kissed the crown of soft golden hair. &quot;We need
a little time alone, Gabrielle. It's been a lifetime ... I miss you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've been right here all along . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't mean . . .&quot; the warrior stumbled, looking for the right words
to say. </p>
<p>As usual, her bard didn't let her falter for long. &quot;I miss you, too, Xena.&quot;
For the first time in days the warrior's touch heralded a bumpy response from
Gabrielle's skin. She missed the feeling of the strong yet gentle touch of her
champion and the intimate embraces they were avoiding because of Eve and perhaps
for other reasons as well. </p>
<p>Reading her lover's mind, Xena responded, &quot;You know Gabrielle, Eve's not
stupid. I'm sure she's figured out by this time that you and I are more than
just traveling companions, after all she has devoured most of you scrolls.&quot;
A slight come-hither look appeared on the otherwise somber face.</p>
<p>&quot;We're only within a day's trek from the village. We've waited this long,
what's another day?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;These are troubled times, and what another day may have in store for us
only the Gods . . . or what's left of them would know. Remember the 'one day
at a time' slogan?&quot; Running a slender finger down the small of Gabrielle's
back, the raven-haired beauty smiled as she watched her lover's skin ripple
under her touch, letting her know she still possessed the power to arouse her
partner's desire with but a simple movement. She leaned down and whispered into
a perfectly formed ear, &quot;I know you miss the touching as much as I do.
I don't want to wait until the village, Gabrielle. I want you now.&quot; Kissing
the small ear she allowed her tongue to travel the distance around the ear to
nibble at the neck beneath.</p>
<p>Focusing her verdant eyes on sapphire orbs, the bard, as usual, gave in to her
warrior. &quot;I must admit you make it impossible to deny you, Xena. Do you
think you could find something for 'our daughter' to do while we're relieving
old memories?&quot; </p>
<p><i>That's
another thing we need to discuss. I remember the first few moons of Eve's life,
every time I went to do something &quot;motherly&quot; you questioned me. Now
you have decided she is mine as well as yours. What caused the change in you,
my warrior? Why are we now sharing a gift you wouldn't even let me help name?</i></p>
<p>&quot;You bet I can.&quot; Quickening her pace the warrior closed the gap between
herself and her daughter. &quot;Eve, wait up.&quot;</p>
<p>Eve stopped in her tracks and waited for her mother to reach her. &quot;What?
Is something wrong? Are we making camp already?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing's
wrong and yes, we're going to make an early camp. We should be able to reach
the village by nightfall tomorrow, even if we stop now. Gabrielle's getting
hungry.&quot; Xena nodded her head back in the direction of the slowly approaching
bard and gave Eve a 'you know Gabrielle' look. If I remember correctly there's
a lake just over that ridge there. Why don't you try your hand at fishing while
we set up camp?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Sure.&quot; Being her mother's daughter all that was needed was a bag
to carry the bounty back into camp, so she deposited the rest of her gear with
her mom. Giving her mother a more knowing look than was expected, the prodigal
announced, &quot;I'll give you two a little extra time to stoke the fire and
perhaps I'll rest a little before bringing dinner back. It might be nice to
sit by the edge of the lake for a while. She's not too hungry is she?&quot;</p>
<p>Xena swallowed hard, realizing that Eve had, indeed, caught on to the scope
of the relationship between her two 'mothers'. Even so they were going to have
to discuss that. They were leading Eve into a village of Amazons, which would
be a totally alien environment for the young woman who grew up as a Roman aristocrat,
surrounded and pursued by members of the opposite sex. Perhaps they would approach
that subject later this evening or over dinner, after her own appetite had been
quenched and she was better able to even think about discussing the topic. Right
now all she wanted was to get back to Gabrielle.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, Eve ... we'll find a nice clearing somewhere around here and see
you in a bit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right, Mother. See you in a bit.&quot; The younger woman flashed another
knowing smile in her mother's direction then turned and headed for the lake.</p>
<p>&quot;Be careful, Eve.&quot; Gabrielle called after her as she neared the spot
where mother and daughter had been talking.</p>
<p>&quot;So.&quot; Gabrielle turned to her dark lover. &quot;How much time do we
have.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;More than enough, I'm sure, but maybe we'd better at least pick out the
site and start the fire first, that way there'll be no hurry.&quot; Grabbing
the bard around the waist she pulled her close. Lips she had known for years
reacquainted themselves. &quot;I can't believe it's taken us this long to get...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course you can . . .&quot; the bard in Gabrielle began reciting all
the reasons why an emotional reunion had been impossible up to this point. &quot;Let's
see, first we were unfrozen, cold, hungry, and confused. Next came the quest
to find Eve, followed by the 'save Livia from herself saga', concluding with
kill the Gods, and throw . . .&quot; </p>
<p>Long, slender fingers covered the bard's sensuous mouth as Xena shook her head,
misty sapphire pools staring through to Gabrielle's soul. &quot;Please, Gabrielle.
Let's not go there just yet. All I want at this moment in my life is to hold
my world in my arms again and let her know how much I've missed her.&quot; </p>
<p>Clearing her throat and breaking the gaze so as not to let Xena see just how
much that confession meant, Gabrielle gently kissed the full lips of her lover,
letting her tongue venture into territory time would never steal from memory.
The soft warmth, sweetness and hunger that was living and waiting for her inside
her warrior's mouth caused her knees to buckle, until she felt a strong, muscular
arm reaching down to pick her up, allowing her to concentrate on the feelings
flowing through her. As in days long gone by, her arms encircled her lover's
neck and she drank in the passion she had been denied for far too long.</p>
<p>A long throaty groan could be heard from the warrior as she broke contact with
the lips eager to continue. &quot;We really need to attempt a start on the camp,
Gabrielle. I promise it will be worth the wait.&quot;</p>
<p>The small blonde shook her head in agreement. &quot;You're absolutely right,
first things first.&quot;</p>
<p>After the saddlebags were emptied and the extra equipment lay on the ground,
the horses were set free to roam for the evening. Xena shifted into high speed
and began a fire that Gabrielle fueled with branches gathered from close by.</p>
<p>Gabrielle padded the ground beneath the bedrolls with an abundance of needles
she found in the surrounding area, positioning the beds in an obscure corner
of the campsite, and totally concealed by fairly high shrubs.</p>
<p>With the fire kindled and cooking utensils set out, the warrior turned and walked
toward her bard. </p>
<p>&quot;Xena, maybe we should have been the ones going for dinner. Wouldn't you
like to have a bath first?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gods Gabrielle ... you're actually serious aren't you? No, I don't care
about a bath. We bathed in the ocean this morning and we can bathe again later.
Right now all I want is . . . you know what I want . . . come here.&quot; She
held out her arms and the small flaxen-haired woman practically fell into them.
</p>
<p>&quot;It's been so long, I just want everything to be perfect.&quot; The whine
was apparent and Xena knew there would be no ignoring the situation.</p>
<p>&quot;You want a ritual of water ... so be it.&quot; Stepping away from Gabrielle
the taller woman strode over to the pile of equipment and supplies she had taken
off Argo. Retrieving one of the water bags and a sponge, she rejoined her lover,
placing the supplies down on the ground before taking off her armor.</p>
<p>&quot;You can keep going,&quot; Gabrielle encouraged from her sitting position
on the joined bedrolls.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, and you can start,&quot; Xena pointed to the bard and flicked her
fingers in a get the damn outfit off motion.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, okay ... just wanted to make sure you wanted to continue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you acting shy for my ... &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Xena, it's been . . .'</p>
<p>&quot;It's been only a few moons as far as our memories and body's are concerned,
but you know what?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's
a few moons too many in my book.&quot; Kneeling down on the bed next to her
bard she whispered, &quot;You can put that in the scrolls.&quot; </p>
<p>Grabbing the water bag she opened it and soaked the sponge. &quot;Okay ... ready
for your ritual by water?&quot; Without waiting for a response, droplets of
tepid liquid fell into the crevice of Gabrielle's navel, filling, pooling, and
overflowing but being quickly caught up again by the swift movements of the
warrior, now turned devoted attendee. Xena ran the sponge, softened by the fluid,
up and down the length of Gabrielle's torso. &quot;Rituals can be very erotic
if handled properly, you know,&quot; the soft contralto voice crooned, as her
lips followed the route the sponge had just taken, blowing softly in its wake.
&quot;You should dry quickly in the heat of the afternoon sun and warmth of
my breath.&quot; She smiled up into lush green eyes. &quot;Why the goose flesh
on such a sunny day?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You know very well, why ... stop teasing Xena.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not teasing Gabrielle ... we haven't finished with the ritual yet. Can't
be continuing on without finishing the ritual first.&quot; She smiled, squeezed
out the sponge and again soaked it with water. This time the soft dripping object
went slightly south of the bard's navel. Xena's attention was focused on the
golden mound that held unforgotten treasures; it glistened in the sunlight as
water danced on the soft curls and they fluttered in the delicate breeze. Slightly
parting the shapely thighs that were also covered in love bumps, the warrior
methodically ran the sponge down the span of each shapely leg, then drew it
back up collecting most of the moisture it had deposited just seconds before.
Finally the object of concentration was the area surrounded by the nether folds
as long, slender fingers opened Gabrielle's passion to drench the inner passages,
already moist with the liquid of love, with the cooling water. </p>
<p>&quot;I'll bathe after,&quot; the warrior declared, &quot; I'm not waiting another
second.&quot; </p>
<p>Positioning her body on top of her bard's she whispered softly. &quot;I've almost
forgotten what you taste like, Gabrielle. I never thought I'd hear myself say
that.&quot; She lowered herself between the smaller woman's legs, her arms reaching
upward teasing the already erect nipples. Almost as an involuntary movement,
Gabrielle's legs separated further, allowing entrance to her nether lips to
be easily accessible to her warrior. With small hands running fervently through
her lover's long dark tresses, forgetting all that came before and all that
still needed to be addressed, the now impatient bard implored . . .</p>
<p>&quot;Take me Xena, please . . . I need you . . . yes . . . yes . . .&quot;</p>
<p>With the expertise that comes from knowing how to best give her bard pleasure,
the warrior began by applying soft wet kisses to the entire area, casually flicking
her tongue over Gabrielle's seat of passion as her tongue leapt between the
smaller woman's thighs.</p>
<p>&quot;By the Gods Xena, Don't make me wait any longer.&quot; With an upward
thrust of her hips she positioned her area of desire where it could receive
the most attention. &quot;Now Xena, take me now!&quot; she pleaded.</p>
<p>Rustling of bushes prompted the warrior to raise her head like that of an animal
suddenly surprised while feasting, causing her to pull away from the warmth
of her lover's body. </p>
<p>&quot;Gabrielle, I think Eve's coming back.&quot; The words left an ache in
her throat as they poured forth from the warrior's lips.</p>
<p>&quot;No, don't you dare stop!&quot; The bard started to continue protesting,
only to be stifled by a large hand covering her mouth.</p>
<p>&quot;Gabrielle, I think your water ritual took too long. I'll make this up
to you, I promise.&quot; She placed a large hand where her mouth had resided
just seconds ago and pushed with an intensity, trying to squelch the need in
herself as well as in that of her lover.</p>
<p>Gabrielle
tried to smile as she clenched the muscles between her legs, attempting to ease
the throbbing as her body cried out for the attention that had just been ripped
from it. </p>
<p>Pulling her warrior into one last embrace she whispered softly, &quot;You bet
Argo you will! Get dressed and go talk to Your daughter!&quot;</p>
<p>With a look of contrition the dark-haired champion, after being released from
the deadlock, scrambled to her feet, quickly pulling on her leathers as she
stood to face the happy fisherwoman coming through the bushes toward the campsite.</p>
<p>Humming to announce her arrival Eve entered the campsite with a full bag. &quot;Fishing's
good at the lake; how was it here?&quot; She smiled at her mother and shook
her head as a slight blush rose to grace the warrior's cheeks. &quot;I'm surprised
you waited so long, I didn't think you were the shy type, Mother.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not but not everyone realizes how quickly you catch on to situations,
Eve.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like mother, like daughter,&quot; Gabrielle chimed in sweetly, stepping
out from behind the bushes.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope you two worked up a good appetite, because these fish practically
jumped into my hands,&quot; Eve bragged, showing off her catch. Taking a knife
from her boots she brandished it. I even took the time to scale and filet them.
You'll be eating like the best patricians in Rome.&quot; </p>
<p>Catching the strained look on the duo standing in front of her, she corrected
the faux pas ... &quot;How about the height of Greek aristocracy. Is that more
to you liking?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Much better, Eve.&quot; Giving the younger woman a weak grin, Gabrielle
held out a pan which the younger woman filled with boneless strips of fresh
water fish.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm starving, what are we having to go with these?&quot; Eve asked.</p>
<p>&quot;I . . . ah . . . didn't have a chance to do any foraging,&quot; Gabrielle
began as she rummaged around getting spices to use on the fish, &quot;I'm sure
there are berries around here somewhere, and there's some bread in the saddlebags.&quot;
</p>
<p>Xena looked around, doing her best to act busy doing something else.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, I get the picture. I'll go pick some berries while dinner is cooking.&quot;
Eve replied, looking at one then the other of her traveling companions with
a broad grin. &quot;Guess it's difficult getting used to having a third wheel
around all the time, huh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No Eve, we love having you with us.&quot; Xena started.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, it just would have been a lot easier if I had stayed a baby and
you two could have gotten used to me gradually. I can understand that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're right in some ways, Eve. But none of us planned for our lives to
take the turn they did.&quot; Gabrielle interjected.</p>
<p>The younger woman gave Gabrielle a look of sympathy, &quot;Mother never did
make it easy for you, did she Auntie Gabrielle?&quot; Not expecting an answer,
she turned and walked into the dense foliage.</p>
<p>Gabrielle turned to the love of her life when Eve was out of hearing distance.
&quot;Xena, we have to make some kind of arrangements to deal with this situation.
It's obvious Eve is not oblivious to the relationship between us and we need
to address it once and for all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know Gabrielle but we were supposed to have a lifetime of raising her
. . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But we didn't and now we have to adjust and so does she. We can't hide
or send her away every time you get amorous.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's just that I didn't think . . .&quot; Xena began.</p>
<p>&quot;That's really quite obvious.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Give me a break, Gabrielle. Listen, we'll go for a walk after dinner.
I promise.&quot;</p>
<p>The bard shook her head, pretending to focus her attention on the browning fish.
</p>
<p>Changing the subject Xena thought now might be the best time to explain to Gabrielle
why she needed to leave for a short side trip. After all, the blonde was already
upset with her, might as well get all the shit out in the open at once. </p>
<p>She cleared her throat and began, &quot;If you were wondering why we took this
short detour on the way the Village . . . I brought us this way because it takes
us near to an area I need to go check out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot;
Gabrielle looked up at her warrior in confusion. &quot;I thought maybe you remembered
an easier way to get to the tribe. Since that isn't the case, what is it you
need to check out?&quot; Gabrielle asked as she took the fish out of the pan
and arranged them in their dinner plates.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh some old stuff I need to make sure is still where I put it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Xena
you're beating around the bush and I'm not sure I like the direction this conversation
is heading.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Gabrielle you don't seem to understand. We've been out of commission for
25 years, people either don't know we exist, think we are legends, or hate us
because of this situation with Eve.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And you point is?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We're broke ... okay is that direct enough for you? At this point in time
we have no means of support and I don't like the feeling. I'm not used to not
being in charge of every aspect of our existence, and this is driving me crazy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So you are going to do exactly What about it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know how much you used to hate our having to rely on my stashes . .
.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are we going there again, Xena?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, as a matter of fact, we are! Listen Gabrielle, there's probably not
a soul left on this earth who remembers these stashes but me. It's only bargaining
power and we certainly could use some of that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Xena you know how I feel about using those treasures.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can't possibly still feel the same way. Think about it Gabrielle,
most of the stashes left are the ones I pilfered from the other warlords. None
of the victims are still alive. It would be stupid to deny us and to deny Eve
a decent existence because of past mistakes. Surely you've learned that by now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess what you're saying makes sense. But I'd feel a lot better about
it if we gave some of the treasure to a charity.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you think we are?&quot; Xena retorted, trying to lighten the discussion.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not a charity case, Xena. We have the means of supporting ourselves,
we have the Amazons . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Get off the lecture box Gabrielle . . . we need the dinars! And, I promise
some of it will go to a worthy cause other than to us. Does that make you happy?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If the truth be told, I was wondering how we were going to survive outside
the Village with people turning their backs on us or trying to eliminate Eve
everywhere we go. This would give us a bit of a cushion to soften these hard
times.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's more like it.&quot; She gave her lover an encouraging hug.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't
go getting too close there, Warrior Babe,&quot; Gabrielle teased, using the
Goddess of Love's affectionate term for the dark-haired beauty. &quot;Remember
the predicament you left me in a short while ago?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So . . . now that you've gotten that little boulder off your chest, I
suppose we could all make the detour instead of you're going alone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That would be great Gabrielle. Instead of my having to wander off, leaving
you and Eve alone, the three of us going together would put us that much closer
to the Village. We may actually still make it by tomorrow night.&quot;</p>
<p>Looking around Gabrielle saw nothing but forest. &quot;Xena call Eve before
this fish gets too cold, she was only supposed to be gathering some berries.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No need Auntie Gabrielle.&quot; The response came from the direction of
the path leading back to the ocean. &quot;I found some of these blackberries,
they're not poison are they Mother?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No
Eve, they'll do just fine.&quot; Xena took the cloth bag brimming with the succulent
fruit and emptied them into a small basin then rinsed them off with the remaining
liquid in the water bag. &quot;Gabrielle and I will refill this and the one
we use for dinner later tonight when we go check out that lake.&quot;</p>
<p>Dinner conversation, consisted of an odd concoction of topics where each of
the women seemed to dance around the real concerns they possessed, generating
long intervals of silence. At the conclusion of the meal, the two 'older' women
volunteered to clean up. Gabrielle put the dishes and utensils into a cleaning
bag and grabbed a couple of towels, while Xena picked up the empty water containers,
tossing them over her shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;We might be a while Eve,&quot; Xena advised her daughter as they headed
toward the lake.</p>
<p>&quot;Take your time, I think I'll do a little exploring and maybe turn in early
tonight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Be sure to feed the fire before turning in, we want to have warm embers
for breakfast. If the fish are still hungry in the morning we might get a repeat
of tonight's meal before heading for the Village.</p>
<p>&quot;Will do Mother, you two enjoy yourselves at the lake.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good night, Eve.&quot; Gabrielle added as she followed Xena into the woods.</p>
<p>The sun was beginning to touch the horizon by the time the two reached the edge
of the lake and Gabrielle stopped to take in the view.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm glad you decided to take that little detour Xena, this lake is worth
the extra time.&quot;</p>
<p>The dark warrior took the bag of dishes from her lover's hand, as well as the
bathing towels and placed them and the skins she was carrying on the ground
at her feet. &quot;Beauty is always worth the extra time and the extra trouble
that it sometimes causes. That's something I've only learned since being with
you, my Bard.&quot; </p>
<p>Tilting the angelic face in front of her upward to gaze into soft emerald eyes,
the warrior's heart melted as it always managed to do when staring into the
face of unconditional love. &quot;You, my love, are still the best thing that
ever happened to me, do you realize that?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I like to believe that to be so, my love . . . I know that's how I feel
about you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Even after all we've been through . . . after all I've . . .&quot; Tears
began to pool in the sapphire eyes staring down at the small figure in her arms.</p>
<p>Slender
fingers reached up to rest on the warrior's lips, quieting the hurtful words,
&quot;Hush, my dark hero, you know that's how I feel. You are my world Xena,
the other half of my soul.&quot; Putting her head on her lover's chest she squeezed
tightly, hoping to relay with a single action all the love that dwelled within
her heart.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you say we take that swim we came here for?&quot; Gabrielle asked,
beginning to undress.</p>
<p>Xena had left her armor back at the campsite, carrying the chakram in hand and
a knife in her boots. Within seconds she was stripped of her leathers and splashing
ahead of her bard in the crystal clear water.</p>
<p>&quot;Race you over to the waterfall Gabrielle,&quot; the warrior called as
she dove deeper into the depths of the lake.</p>
<p>&quot;Some
race,&quot; Gabrielle shouted after her. &quot;Looks like you've got yourself
a pretty good head start! Why don't you just tread water and wait for me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can do that,&quot; replied Xena as she turned and paddled slightly closer
to the shoreline.</p>
<p>As
Gabrielle began walking into the crisp, refreshing lake, she looked out over
the rippling water at her lover. She was convinced that going back to the Amazons
would be the best solution to their present troubles . . . it had to be. If
things didn't get better soon, there was that gut wrenching feeling that they
would only get worse. Perhaps spending some quality time alone tonight would
be a turning point. All they needed was a chance to start breaking down the
wall standing between them, a chance to start the talking again, to make it
comfortable like it used to be, so the healing could begin. </p>
<p>Impatience got the best of Xena and she yelled from the middle of the lake,
&quot;What do you intend to do walk all the way over here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here I come, you wait right there!&quot; Gabrielle shouted as she dove
deep into the cooling liquid and swam toward her dark hero.</p>
<p>Long strokes shortened to allow them to swim side-by-side as the distance between
the swimmers and the raging waters lessened.</p>
<p>&quot;Look Gabrielle, over there, to the right of the falls.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see a ledge, come on.&quot; The warrior hastened her advance to the
falls, her bard following closely in her wake.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the edge of the cascading water the outcropping was within arms
reach of the tall warrior. Taking a leap out of the water, she hurled herself
upwards and landed on the smooth damp surface. By this time Gabrielle had situated
herself beneath the ledge and with curiosity was looking upward.</p>
<p>&quot;Surely you don't expect me to follow you ... with that jump you just performed!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course not. Let me look around a bit and make sure it's safe up here,
then I'll help you up ... Shorty.&quot; She grinned broadly at her bard knowing
the irritation the pet name caused.</p>
<p>&quot;If you want company sitting up there on that long piece of rock . . .
&quot; Gabrielle began then ended shouting to herself as her warrior disappeared
behind a curtain of water.</p>
<p>Coming
back around with a large grin on her face Xena raised her hands, producing a
long expanse of vine. &quot;Will you look what I found back near the other side
of this aperture. There's a path leading back into the woods I believe, but
I tore some of this vine off the cave wall. It's huge back here Gabrielle and
warm and dry. Come on up.&quot;</p>
<p>Finding a large branch sticking out of the rocks the dark warrior tied the vine
securely and lowered it down for her lover to climb. &quot;Hold on tightly,
it'll be easier if I pull you up.&quot; With that Gabrielle found herself being
drawn quickly toward the ledge.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay.&quot; The blonde exclaimed standing and looking out over the lake.
&quot;Do I need to change your title from warrior to explorer?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,
no. I'll just add a new hat to my already growing collection.&quot; The raven-haired
beauty grabbed her bard and pulled her close. &quot;How fortuitous for us ...
this place is only about a day from the Village ... when we get our fill of
being part of a communal and I'm sure we will, we now have a special haven to
escape to. Come on Gabrielle let's explore.&quot;</p>
<p>Smiling up at her warrior who was acting more like an excited child she agreed
that this looked like an ideal place to have a mini-vacation from the rest of
the world. </p>
<p>Looking around Gabrielle beheld a natural paradise. The spray from the water
was strong in certain areas but flowed like a mist in others, which made it
excellent for showering. Further into the ledge the rock became concave, forming
an expansive room-like area. Over to the far left light could be seen filtering
in, both from above and from the western corner where the mountain graciously
created a natural archway leading back into the lush forest. </p>
<p>&quot;Isn't this beautiful Gabrielle?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The stuff stories are made of,&quot; the bard agreed.</p>
<p>&quot;But Xena we need to get back to the campsite before too long. I don't
think we should leave Eve alone.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know your memory is better than that. Eve can take care of herself.
Would you hesitate to leave me alone in the woods?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When you put it that way . . . but Xena we told her we'd be back, don't
you think she'll worry?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're right.&quot; A look of melancholy came over the angular features
of the warrior's face, then the twinkle quickly returned to her sapphire eyes.
&quot;I know. You stay here Gabrielle I'll go back and tell Eve we decided to
sleep away from camp tonight. I know she won't mind. I'll tell her to come sleep
by the water's edge if she wants and that we will be within shouting distance.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think that's a good . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Gabrielle she's a big girl, she almost married Caesar, she had an affair
with Ares . . . she can spend the night alone and the Gods know we need some
time. We're going to be surrounded by your tribe come this time tomorrow night.
Give me a break Gabrielle.&quot;</p>
<p>Knowing the ramblings of the raven-haired beauty to be truths, Gabrielle shook
her head affirmatively, her heart rejoicing at the prospect of being totally
alone with her lover on this perch, hidden behind a waterfall.</p>
<p>She watched as the graceful muscular figure dove off the ledge and into the
calm water below and waved when she reached the water's edge. <i>I hope she
remembers to bring something to strike a fire so we aren't working for candlemarks
trying to get one started.</i></p>
<p>Thinking she would walk down after Xena left to retrieve her clothing lying
on the banks, she began walking over toward the light at the edge of the cave.
<i>I truly hope this spot is as deserted as it seems. I'd hate getting caught
both nude and weaponless!</i></p>
<p>As she walked through the opening she noticed a different scent to the air,
a sweet fragrance that was not foreign to her sense of smell. <i>Where in Tartarus
have I smelled this before?</i></p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a sparkle of gold tinged with pink and the answer appeared
before her very eyes. &quot;Aphrodite!&quot; A shocked, Gabrielle tried to cover
her bareness.</p>
<p>&quot;I really did catch you unaware, didn't I Little One,&quot; the Goddess
of Love giggled as she waved a hand and clothed the body before her in a flowing
negligee. &quot;There that ought to keep you decent until the Warrior Babe returns.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aphrodite, what are you doing here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Waiting for you to find this place. Take a look around you, Gabrielle;
this is no ordinary forest. You would find it very difficult to return to the
lake from here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't understand.&quot; Gabrielle confessed as she gave the Goddess
a bewildered look.</p>
<p>&quot;Olympus is in shambles, half of my family is dead, I needed someplace
quiet to go, so . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So you created this refuge to escape all that was happening.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You got it kiddo. I knew you and Xena would be traveling somewhere close
to here. I've been watching the three of you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Speaking of watching over us, I hear I owe you an enormous Thank You for
taking care of me when . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No need for that Little Bard, you've always had a special place in my
heart.&quot;</p>
<p>They sat and talked for a while discussing some of their times together like
when Aphrodite put a spell on Gabrielle's scrolls and got a taste of mortal
life or the time when Gabrielle was having a bout of writer's block and they
had their own private pajama party. Finally the conversation turned more serious
as they spoke of the events of the last few moons.</p>
<p>&quot;You
know Gabrielle, neither you nor Xena asked for the tapestry of your lives to
weave the design it's been spinning the past 25 years. It would not be fair
to blame the two of you for all that has come to pass. The obstacles placed
in your path would have been insurmountable for less noble souls.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That may be the truth, but our problems now are dealing with the events
that have just passed.&quot; Gabrielle confessed. &quot;I need to ask Xena why
she threw the chakram when she could have done something less destructive. I
don't know how to ask and I don't want to drive the wedge further between us.
But, if the question isn't brought out into the open, I'm afraid it will fester.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I tell you what happened Gabrielle do you think you could then let
it go?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Please Aphrodite, I would again be in your debt ... Xena and I would both
be grateful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To begin with I want you to know that I asked Athena not to involve you
in her scheme, but she was terrified of Eve and the twilight that was upon us.
You also need to know, because she will never tell you, that Xena is as distraught
over the incident as you are Gabrielle, and if you don't let her know that it
wasn't her fault and that you forgive her completely the guilt will someday
destroy her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Anything you can tell me would be greatly appreciated but she'll be back
shortly and . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry about that, my little friend, I'm still the Goddess of Love
and my powers are still intact.&quot; She motioned for Gabrielle to sit down
next to her on a soft stump covered with moss and the young bard did as she
was bid.</p>
<p>&quot;I
have tried to help the three of you when I could, Little One. I've even asked
Morpheus to soften your dreams so none of you would be haunted with nightmares.
All three of you have issues to deal with, but none of them are unconquerable,
and taking Eve to live with the Amazons is the best thing you can do for your
daughter at this stage in her life. She may not have grown under your heart
Gabrielle but if you'd been given the chance you deserved, the girl would have
surely grown in it. With you and her mother as inspiration, she will come out
of this ordeal a better person. But I can see now that you need more than pleasant
dreams to turn your lives around.&quot;</p>
<p>The small blonde listened intently as the Goddess began to explain what happened
the fateful night that Gabrielle stabbed Eve and Xena, in turn, hit Gabrielle
in the head with the chakram.</p>
<p>&quot;You see Gabrielle, Athena's plan was to have the Furies drive you to killing
Eve by putting misleading thoughts into your head. The problem was keeping Xena
away long enough to get the deed completed. Ares volunteered to lure your warrior
out into the rain and keep her there until her child was no longer a threat
to us, but with her almost godly intuition, she sensed that something was amiss
and started to run back into the house. Two of the Furies left you and went
to dance in the mind of your lover, telling her that Hope had returned to kill
Eve as she had Solon so many years before. The thoughts began to drive her mad
and when she opened the door, it was not you she saw standing over Eve with
the sai in your hand, it was Hope with a sacrificial knife. Her immediate response
was to throw the most lethal weapon at her disposal and that of course was her
chakram.&quot;</p>
<p>Tears flowed freely down the cheeks of the bard as she listened intently to
the story the Goddess of Love unfolded for her. Gabrielle's heart lightened
as she felt the weight of doubt being lifted, and the love for her warrior rushing
in to heal the scar that it left behind. </p>
<p>&quot;How can I tell Xena that I know and understand, Aphrodite? How can I help
her to forgive herself for something she actually had no conscious involvement
in?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Tell her I talked to you, explain everything I just told you and let her
know that you know she was unable to control the forces of the Furies. She'll
understand, she knew they were in your head after she hit you and you fell.
She just didn't remember that it was the vision of Hope that she had seen and
she can not forgive herself for wounding you with the chakram.&quot; </p>
<p>The Goddess smiled at the mortal before her. Gabrielle's tender heart and unconditional
love for her champion were but a couple of the reasons the Goddess of Love held
the young bard in such high esteem.</p>
<p>&quot;Time to dry those pretty green eyes, Little One,&quot; Aphrodite grinned.
&quot;I do believe the Warrior Babe has just returned to the lake. Here, let
me help you get this place ready for her return.&quot;</p>
<p>Upon re-entering the cave, the Goddess waved a hand and in an instant there
was a large heart shaped bed in the middle of the room with burning candles
hanging from the walls. There was an odor of fragrant flowers permeating the
entire area. Off in one corner there appeared shelves holding towels, incense,
additional candles, flint to light the candles, shifts and negligees. There
was a small table to one side of the bed containing two goblets filled with
the sweet nectar of Dionyesis and a pitcher also filled with the same liquid.</p>
<p>&quot;Aphrodite,&quot; Gabrielle gasped as she watched the cave being transformed
into a lover's suite. &quot;I don't know what to say.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you would be more than appropriate,&quot; the deity smiled at her
mortal charge. &quot;I am still the Goddess of Love you know, and the two of
you could certainly use a little help in getting back into the groove of things.&quot;
The Goddess beamed at the response her gift was producing.</p>
<p>She placed her hands on Gabrielle's shoulders. &quot;This is a private place
and only you and Xena will ever be able to find it. The archway will lead to
anywhere you wish to go. It might take you a while to get here from wherever
you are, but when it is time to leave you need only walk through into the forest
and think about where it is you want to be; you will be transported there immediately.
The two of you are always in my heart, Gabrielle, the tests your love has been
challenged to endure proves beyond a doubt that true love is definitely unconditional.&quot;</p>
<p>Gabrielle started to open her mouth to speak when she heard the sound of Xena
jumping back up onto the ledge. She spun around to greet her lover, while from
the corner of her eye she witnessed the sparks of pink and gold as her friend,
the Goddess of Love, disappeared. </p>
<p>The bard couldn't help giggling at the expression on her naked lover's face
when Xena took in the transformation of the cave.</p>
<p>&quot;What in the name of . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aphrodite was here Xena. She told me this is a special sanctuary, just
for us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I didn't know better I would swear that the two of us consumed tainted
nutbread for dinner. But I do know better. Did you say Aphrodite was here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes, my love, and she told me things . . . things that it's now time
for us to discuss.&quot; She grabbed a towel from a shelf and proceeded to dry
the glistening body of her warrior. Then handed Xena a shift and motioned her
toward the bed.</p>
<p>The phrase, &quot;This is unbelievable,&quot; was repeated more than once by
the raven-haired beauty as she gazed around the enchanted cave. &quot;Why Gabrielle?
Did Aphrodite tell you why she would do this for us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here Xena, drink this.&quot; Gabrielle handed her lover one of the goblets.
&quot;Sit down and I'll share with you everything Aphrodite told me while she
was here.&quot;</p>
<p>Gabrielle sat next to her lover, gently stroking her back as she retold the
story, practically word-for-word. Intermittently throughout the tale, she wiped
away tears of her own and tears of her lover's as the healing process began
to run its course. When she finished there was a heavy silence surrounding the
two shadowy figures, who sat clinging to each other as if there were not another
living being on the face of the earth.</p>
<p>&quot;I love you more than life, Gabrielle.&quot; Xena finally spoke into the
quiet. &quot;This wasn't how I planned to spend this night, but I'm glad we
both finally know the truth. I once told you that even in death I would not
leave you and I kept that promise. I now renew that oath to you, my love, my
heart, and my soulmate. Your forgiveness has lifted a guilt that's been slowing
eating away at me since that night, and I'm glad we can finally begin to put
it all behind us. Do you think it's too much to ask for the rest of our lives
to run a little smoother?&quot; </p>
<p>The bard's dark angel looked into soft verdant eyes that twinkled in the shadow
of slowly extinguishing candles. An impish smile crept across Gabrielle's face.
&quot;Oh, my love, you wouldn't know what to do with yourself if your life became
uncomplicated, and I wouldn't know what to do with a warrior with no battles
to fight. No . . . I do believe we will constantly have obstacles placed at
our feet, the only saving grace is that the two of us will tackle them together.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Together,&quot; Xena repeated. &quot;It seems like ages since we've been
alone together.&quot; The tone was melancholy. Sapphire eyes gazed intently
onto the face she loved, taking in all the nuances that allowed this visage
to send chills up and down her spine. She drank in the soft girlish features,
the slightly freckled nose, and most importantly the expressive green eyes that
could fluctuate between opposing emotions in the span of a heartbeat. </p>
<p>Gabrielle's small hands cradled her champion's face, while questioning eyes
scanned the solemn expression it now displayed. &quot;What is it Xena?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was just thinking of what my life would be like without you, and I know
it wouldn't be worth living.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, the Powers That Be willing, neither one of us will have to face
that situation for a long time to come.&quot;</p>
<p>Xena gently lowered her bard onto the bed, slipping off the negligee that reminded
her more of the Goddess who supplied it, than it did the woman who was wearing
it. Knowing fingers re-explored the exposed body of the small blonde, starting
at the neck and tenderly continuing down to areas that had been neglected for
far too long. </p>
<p>&quot;I believe I promised you the completion of a seduction started many candlemarks
ago, my bard.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I believe you are absolutely correct, my warrior.&quot; Gabrielle smiled,
pulling Xena closer and running her hands through the still damp hair. &quot;I
intend to hold you to that promise.&quot; She passionately kissed her love as
Xena's hands continued to caress the body now beneath her.</p>
<p>&quot;You still have that shift on Xena ... take it off, please.&quot;</p>
<p>The warrior sat up and pulled the article of clothing off, letting it drape
over the bed as she quickly went back to the pleasure at hand. Her lips found
their match as she gently bit Gabrielle's bottom lip before allowing her tongue
access to the sweetness within her bard's mouth. &quot;I love you,&quot; she
whispered without removing her lips.</p>
<p>&quot;You're talking with your mouth full,&quot; Gabrielle mumbled between breaths.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh you think so, do you? I'll show you talking with my mouth full.&quot;
Xena slid her body further down her lover's, positioning herself between Gabrielle's
willing thighs, while placing her mouth around a firm breast and cupping the
other in her hand. &quot;I love you Gabrielle,&quot; the words were almost inaudible
but they brought a smile to the petite blonde's face.</p>
<p>Strong, long fingers interlaced with small, slender ones as Xena took both of
the bard's hands and raised them high above the golden head, bringing her own
body to full length on top of the one beneath her, and then some. Blue velvet
eyes looked longingly into the gentle green orbs of her lover as she captured
a memory and placed it into her heart's scrapbook. </p>
<p>Reining in the passion that was desperately trying to burst free, she again
lowered her face down, and to within a hair's breathe of the one she loved,
&quot;Marry me, Gabrielle?!&quot; It was difficult to ascertain whether the
statement was a request or a demand. &quot;It's the only step we haven't taken
in this love affair of ours. We've already pledged unending commitment. Marry
me amongst the throngs of Amazons who love you as their Queen. Let me become
the Queen's Consort in every meaning of the word.&quot;</p>
<p>A
sharp intake of breath followed by a single tear brought a smile to the warrior.
As she kissed away the dampness on the face of her fair Gabrielle, her bard
uttered sweetly, &quot;Oh Xena . . . yes . . . yes . . . Yes!&quot; </p>
<p>Xena felt her heart swell with joy as the desired words danced in her mind.
Unable to contain herself any longer, the bard's dark hero let loose the hunger
that had been building throughout the day. </p>
<p>Groans of pleasure became music to her ears as she again lowered herself toward
the golden mound of soft curls to partake in the treasures beneath. &quot;What
do you want, my love?&quot; Xena questioned as Gabrielle opened her legs to
allow her lover entrance.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think you need to ask,&quot; came the soft reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Need to . . . No . . . I don't need to, but I want to hear you tell me.
It's been ages since I've heard your desires voiced.&quot; The dark warrior
caressed the golden locks below her lover's abdomen as she whispered into the
folds beneath the curls, teasingly touching the now moist area with quick, rapid
thrusts of her tongue.</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me Gabrielle,&quot; she whispered, beginning to drink in the elixir
of love, quenching her desire and causing her own center to become wet with
anticipation. </p>
<p>&quot;Tell me,&quot; she repeated.</p>
<p>&quot;I want you to taste me . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like this?&quot; Xena sucked softly on the small erect bud centered under
the folds of her lover's nether lips. </p>
<p>&quot;Harder Xena . . .&quot;</p>
<p>The warrior concentrated on stroking the small erection with her tongue using
swift, constant movements. &quot;Like this?&quot; she queried.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, my love, yes.&quot; The small blonde ran her fingers through her
lover's hair. &quot;Harder Xena, please . . .&quot; </p>
<p>Xena graciously obeyed, and the fair-haired woman began, digging her nails deep
into the flesh of the muscular shoulders at the tips of her fingers.</p>
<p>&quot;Xena . . . oh . . . Xena . . . By the Gods!&quot; </p>
<p>Ever the experienced lover, Xena smiled inwardly, knowing that within seconds
her bard would beg for a reprieve. </p>
<p>Never one to disappoint her warrior Gabrielle's next response pleaded for exactly
that.</p>
<p>&quot;Enough . . . Xena . . . enough!&quot; The bard pushed on the shoulders
beneath her hands, trying desperately to move her body away from the celestial
torture as her passion erupted beyond tolerance.</p>
<p>Absolutely aware of the precise second between euphoria and exquisite agony,
the raven-haired beauty lifted her mouth from the volcano of love, repositioned
her body on top of Gabrielle, and allowed her eager fingers to enter the depths
of her lover's hunger. </p>
<p>&quot;Come for me Gabrielle,&quot; resounded as a throaty plea from deep within
the warrior's soul. &quot;That's the way, my love . . . come for me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By the Gods, Xena . . . I love you,&quot; was the only response the bard
was able to expel before her dark hero straddled her thigh, the warrior's own
fire rising higher with each thrust. </p>
<p>The two rode together on wings of desire to the realm of rapture. Echoes of
passion filled the walls within the cave; magic muted the cries of love from
the outside world, which heard only the roar of the waterfall. </p>
<p>Exhausted
. . . emotionally and physically satisfied, and for the first time since awakening
from their frozen hibernation, the warrior and her bard would sleep side-by-side
without another soul within eyesight. Reminiscent of happier times the two intertwined
their bodies, seeking solace in the fact that after all they had gone through,
they were still together and even more in love if that were humanly possible.
As they lay there listening to what they thought would have been the roar of
the falls, the lover's realized that from this side, it was merely a soft trickling
sound that easily helped to lull the duo to sleep, after the gratification of
their renewed vows.</p>
<p>Tomorrow would be another day, but it would have the distinction of starting
off with a healing breath. The sins of the past were cleansed this enchanted
night and the hopes of tomorrow renewed.</p>
