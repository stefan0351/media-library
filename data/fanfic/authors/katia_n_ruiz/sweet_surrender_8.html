<!-- A Sweet Surrender \ Chapter Seven -->

<p>Andrea sat down on her couch, smiling at Carey Mitchell as she handed her a tall glass of orange juice. Carey had called and Andrea, in her loneliness, had asked her over to chat for a while. Jeffrey had left on his business trip already, and wouldn't be back for almost a month; new turn of events had taken place, and the business stay would last longer than planned.</p>
		<p>Carey smiled at Andrea, wondering what was bothering Andrea so much. As soon as she heard Andrea's voice over the phone lines, she knew that something was going on in Andrea's mind. She seemed sad, distracted, as if she were in another plane of this universe. Andrea asked her to visit her that night; told her that she needed someone to talk to. "Andrea," Carey said, brushing her thick red hair away from her forehead. She fixed her gray eyes on Andrea, forcing her with simply her will to look at her. "What's going on in that head of yours?" She asked softly, the melodious tilt of her Irish accent relaxing Andrea.</p>
		<p>Andrea sighed, not knowing herself what was happening to her. All she knew was that she couldn't keep her mind off Cassidy, could not stop thinking about her. Every time she closed her eyes, she could envision the way Cassidy looked when she drew Andrea's hands to her mouth and kissed them softly. The passion Andrea saw in her features could not be mistaken, the passion she realized afterwards that she'd also felt at that moment couldn't be mistaken either. She told Carey of this, of the way her heart beat out of control every time she was around Cassidy, every time Cassidy touched her or looked at her. Of the way her body responded when Cassidy held her, when they danced together. She was so confused, she wrung her hands and it looked as if she would rub off the skin.</p>
		<p>Carey nodded thoughtfully, and pursed her lips in satisfaction of her own foresight. Andrea was more than likely falling head over heels in love with Cassidy, or was realizing that she had been in love with Cassidy all along. She smiled, leaning forward, grasping Andrea's wringing hands and squeezing comfortingly. "Andrea," She said after a long while. "Have you told Cassidy of these sensations?"</p>
		<p>Andrea shook her head, looking as if telling Cassidy was out of the question. "No!" She said in a frantic whisper. "What if Cassidy wouldn't want to be my friend any more? What if she got scared of me or something?"</p>
		<p><i>She's so innocent in so many ways</i>. Carey thought with an inward smile. She met Cassidy once, and could instantly tell that Cassidy was deeply in love with Andrea. She didn't blame her. "Andrea, what you are feeling is something normal-"</p>
		<p>"Normal?" Andrea asked, cutting her off. "This feeling that my heart will burst out of my body when she looks at me? These feelings that my body will melt in her arms when she holds me close to dance or just to hug me?" She was turning red as she spoke, she closed her eyes with passion. "I mean... I was rambling on last night, and I could feel her eyes on me, all I could do was blush. My body just reacted when she kissed my hands, I felt a jolt of electricity like I'd never felt in my life with anyone. And you're telling me this is normal? She's my best friend, for God's sake!"</p>
		<p>Carey smiled patiently, her thin lips curving in a gentle smile. "Do you think you may be falling in love with your best friend? Could it be impossible?" She asked, bracing for any reaction.</p>
		<p>Andrea stood up from the couch and walked over to the window, pushing her fingers through her hair and staring out at the dark city. Falling in love with Cassidy? She didn't know. "I'm not." She said, shaking her head vehemently.</p>
		<p>Carey sat back on the couch and smiled, she didn't need to press on.</p>
