<!-- A Sweet Surrender \ Chapter One -->

<p>"We made reservations for four." Jeffrey said, with an air of self-importance, his arm around Andrea's shoulders protective.</p>
		<p>The old matron's eyes were trapped on Andrea, his smile foolish, revealing a set of teeth too white and clean to be real. Only Jeffrey would notice that. "Your name, sir?" He asked with a thick French accent, his old wrinkled hands nervously twisting his pen around.</p>
		<p>"Jeffrey Rosenthal." Jeffrey replied, proud of Andrea's effect on people.</p>
		<p>The matron was reluctant to move his eyes away from Andrea, as if she would disappear as soon as he looked away, like a mirage. He found the name and walked them into the restaurant's non-smoking area. Andrea looked around at the decorations and was awed. The place was beautiful and tasty; everything seemed to be made of wood, beautiful shiny wood. The tables were spaciously set apart to give the waiters the perfect space to walk through without bothering the clients. There was a small dance floor; the band would play tastefully soft music.</p>
		<p>The matron pulled the chair at the table for Andrea, smiling at her gracious thank you. "I am at your service." He retorted. <i>My, this guy's completely smitten!</i> Jeffrey thought with amusement. "Would you like anything to drink while you wait for the rest of your party?" He asked eagerly.</p>
		<p>"Don Perignon." Jeffrey said, dismissing him with a look.</p>
		<p>The Don Perignon arrived shoved delicately into a silvery bucket full of ice a few minutes later. The waiter brought four glasses, filled two and left them. Not long after, the old matron brought in Cassidy and Robie. Jeffrey didn't fail to notice the way Andrea's face lit up at the sight of Cassidy, and neither did Robie. Jeffrey poured Don Perignon for Robie and Cassidy, remaining civilized as he returned Cassidy's unsmiling greeting. He flinched when Andrea threw her arms around Cassidy and held her tightly.</p>
		<p>Robie smiled at Jeffrey, aware of the jealousy seething from him. She knew of Cassidy's feelings for Andrea, but she didn't drive herself crazy like Jeffrey seemed to do. One reason being that she never fell out of love with her previous lover, who was gone on some type of project for the museum for which she was an archeologist. From time to time, her ex-lover would write her, sweet promising letters, proving she hadn't fallen out of love either. She hadn't told Cassidy of this yet, but planned to tell her soon.</p>
		<p>"Robie," Cassidy said over Andrea's shoulder. "You remember Jeffrey." She flipped a hand between them.</p>
		<p>Jeffrey smiled at her sincerely and took her small hand into his larger one. "I do remember," He said, his smile turned flirty. "It is a pleasure seeing you again."</p>
		<p><i>This guy is so full of himself!</i> Robie thought with amusement. Her opinion of him hadn't changed since she met him a little over a month before at a party both Andrea and Cassidy had been invited to. Andrea finally let Cassidy go, and they sat down. Their assigned waiter brought their menus. Cassidy didn't look at the menu, and ordered a tasteful dinner based on seafood; she was a vegetarian. After a while, they ordered.</p>
		<p>Andrea was ecstatic, immensely happy to see Cassidy again. "Cassidy," She said breathlessly, taking her hand. "I'm so happy to finally see you!" Her voice broke with emotion, her eyes filled with tears.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled tenderly, and gently wiped the tears from her cheeks with her thumbs, pressing her palms to her cheeks. "I am too." She whispered the love in her eyes and voice unmistakable; only Andy couldn't see it. She brightened suddenly, and turned to Robie. "Let me get it, Robie." She said eagerly, giving her a grateful smile. She lifted the little stuffed bear and gift box from Robie's hand and handed it to Andrea, whose beautiful face was glowing with feeling. Cassidy said: "Happy Valentine's day."</p>
		<p>Andrea's smile full and wide, her eyes twinkling. <i>God, no wonder Cassidy fell in love with her!</i> Robie thought. <i>I would too, if it weren't for Isabelle.</i> Andrea's arms were around Cassidy's neck again; she was laughing with delight. "Thank you," She said shakily, unable to hold back her emotions. She smelled the stuffed bear and smiled at Jeffrey. Her grinning eyes returned to Cassidy's. "It smells like you, Cassidy." She whispered.</p>
		<p><i>I could swear Andrea's in love with Cassidy too.</i> Robie thought to herself, smiling. Her eyes went to Jeffrey, and her smile faded. <i>But then what is she doing with this pompous asshole?</i> She watched Andrea open the gift box and beam proudly as she stared the beautiful bracelet inside. The food arrived, and they spoke while they ate. Jeffrey made sure he kissed Andrea from time to time, smiling smugly at Cassidy behind her back. Andrea asked Cassidy and Robie how things were with them, about their jobs, about everything she could find to ask about. She was unaware of the way Jeffrey leered at Cassidy, and when Cassidy became pensively quiet, she didn't know why either.</p>
		<p>The band began to play at nine o'clock, soft beautiful music Cassidy recognized from her childhood. She asked Robie for a dance, excusing herself from the table. She guided Robie through the slow rhythm, her hand on her hip holding her close to herself. Robie wrapped her arms around Cassidy's neck and rested her head on her shoulder, pressing her face against the smooth neck. "Andrea must be very na&iuml;ve." She commented, trying to sound casual.</p>
		<p>Cassidy frowned, pulling back to look at her face. "Why do you say that?" She asked.</p>
		<p>Robie laughed, and looked directly into her eyes. "Because she doesn't realize how much in love with her you really are." She said, and felt Cassidy stiffen against her. Cassidy never told her of her feelings for Andrea. "And because she's with that asshole."</p>
		<p>Cassidy didn't respond and skillfully guided her throughout the song, never missing a beat. Andrea watched them with a dreamy smile on her face; she planned on asking Cassidy to dance with her afterwards. Jeffrey held her hand, but didn't ask her to dance; he wasn't one to dance. There were a lot of things he wasn't into that Andrea liked, some called him uptight, and he called himself "too good for trivialities."</p>
		<p>Robie and Cassidy returned to the table after a couple of songs, and as one of Andrea's favorite songs was starting, she asked Cassidy to dance with her. Cassidy looked at Robie, who smiled and shrugged in consent, and at Jeffrey, who glared at her with deep hate and jealousy. Before Cassidy could set her to what she felt would be a safe position between them, Andrea drew close and wrapped her arms around her neck. Cassidy reluctantly wrapped her own arms around Andrea's small waist, taking a deep breath as Andrea pushed herself closer to her.</p>
		<p>The band played the slow ballad, Chicago's "If you leave me now," a well known love song. Andrea felt a sense of peace in Cassidy's strong arms, her body felt warm close to hers; she felt complete after that whole month of not seeing Cassidy. Her eyes filled with tears again and she looked up at her. Their faces were close together and she could feel Cassidy's sweet breath against her lips. "Why did you leave like that?" She asked suddenly, her voice thick with tears, not realizing the magnitude of her hurt. "What did I do to you, Cassidy?" Cassidy's eyes widened as the tears spilled from Andrea's eyes. "You've been different the past year, why?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy was speechless, she didn't know she'd hurt Andrea to that extent. "Oh, Andy," She sighed, feeling her own tears wet her cheeks. "It's not you, babe. Trust me, it's not you." Her voice shook. "I'm sorry I've been so distant." She tightened her grip on Andy and rocked her gently. She pressed her lips against her forehead and closed her eyes with the emotion in her heart being almost unbearable; she held her for a long time, until their tears subsided.</p>
		<p>They were unaware of Jeffrey's cold blue eyed glare, of his anger practically burning Robie with its radiation.</p>
