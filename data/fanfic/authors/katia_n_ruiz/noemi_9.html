<!-- Noemí \ Chapter Nine -->

<p>"Wait outside, Noemí, I'm going to check her out and I'll call you back in when we finish." Doctor Travis Martin said to Noemí. He gestured her in. "If you may come in, Ms. Bledsoe." She preceded him into the office, both leaving Noemí alone in the waiting room.</p>
		<p>A pleasant man well into his fifties, he still looked fit and handsome. He had been the Leone's doctor forever, since before Noemí was born. She had grown to love him like an uncle, and he had grown to love her like a niece. He had been there when she'd suffered the accident, making sure himself that she was being taken care of correctly. When they had found out that she would remain blind in her left eye, he fought and fought to find a way to fix it, letting his emotional attachment to the Leone children and parents to overlook his professional knowledge.</p>
		<p>He'd been the one who convinced her that she could still drive, though with a little more caution. He'd been with her when she'd first gotten behind the wheel of a car more than a year after the accident, grasping her shoulder comfortingly, though he was a little frightened when she finally thought she could drive normally again and swerved awkwardly. It took a lot of work, but she drove now as if nothing was wrong with one of her eyes.</p>
		<p>Noemí sat down on one of the waiting chairs and leaned her head back against the wall. Nursing a little hangover, she became aware of her body ache. She'd spent most of the night in her little gym, and had exhausted every muscle in her body. Her arms, shoulders, and thighs felt taut. Today, she wore khaki slacks, a white T-shirt and brown loafers. She felt comfortable and relished that rare occasion. She waited more than an hour, knowing very well how Travis Martin could be exaggeratedly thorough, specially with a first time patient. She was standing studying one of the numerous paintings in the room when Travis came out of his examining room. He closed the door quietly and Noemí didn't realize he was next to her until he cleared his throat.</p>
		<p>She turned to look at him and smiled. "So," She began. "How are she and the baby?"</p>
		<p>Travis looked at her for a long moment. "First of all," He said, wagging a stern finger at her. "Don't think I don't notice that you haven't been eating or sleeping, my dear patient; and that you haven't come in here for a checkup in a long time. Do you think, by any chance, that I am stupid? Don't try to act like there is nothing going on." He sounded very angry with her, and she stared at him for a long time before answering.</p>
		<p>"Travis," She said slowly, through clenched teeth. "This appointment is not about me, okay?" She pointed at the door to the examining room. "I brought her in here to talk about <i>her</i> health, not about mine, so lets not get sidetracked. Okay?"</p>
		<p>He moved closer to her and looked into her eyes. "You haven't been sleeping, why?" He asked in a quiet voice, ignoring the warning in her voice that he knew so well. "What is going on? Why don't you talk to me?"</p>
		<p>Noemí looked away from him and shoved her hands in her pockets. "There is nothing going on with me. What about her?" She said, again through clenched teeth. "That <i>is</i> what I'm here for, <i>remember</i>?"</p>
		<p>He knew he was getting to her, so he backpedaled, sighing. "We will talk later." He warned as he guided her towards the examining room.</p>
		<p>Terri sat on the examining table, fully clothed already, though her worn shoes lay on the floor. She looked at Noemí pleadingly. "I can't bend down to even put my shoes back on." She said, wondering how she'd done it this morning.</p>
		<p>Noemí eyed her stomach as she bent down to pick up one shoe and slipped it into her swelling foot, and saw hardly any difference in its size. Travis saw her look and explained: "As you know, darling, the fetus doesn't blow up until about the end of the second trimester. She's only in the beginning. Come sit on these chairs." They did so and he continued: "She's anemic," He saw the look of alarm in Noemí's eyes and soothed her. "There is nothing wrong if we take care of that; prenatal vitamins, regular checkups, that type of thing. I'm recommending her to take a Lamaze class."</p>
		<p>Noemí started. "La-what?" She asked, sitting forward on the seat.</p>
		<p>Travis smiled as he pulled his prescription pad and began to write a prescription for the vitamins Terri had to drink for the remaining months of pregnancy. "Lamaze," He repeated for Terri's benefit, he knew Noemí knew what Lamaze was. "It is basically a physical and psychological course for the mother to learn the art of being completely connected to the moment of childbirth without drugs. Usually, the fathers, or the other half of the couple learn with the mother, so that he or she can be there to help her when the moment gets tough. In the case of single mothers, usually a friend or family member joins that person in the birthing room, and they usually won't allow them in unless they have Lamaze training, a few exceptions included." He paused, then to their amazement, said: "I'd prefer if you, Noemí, since you will be sharing most of the time with Terri, take the Lamaze class with her."</p>
		<p>Noemí looked at him, thinking <i>He is crazy!</i> She shook her head and sat back, glancing at Terri, who looked at her dubiously. "We can hardly get along for more than two hours without fighting, Travis." She said as a means of explanation. Terri nodded her agreement.</p>
		<p>Travis gave the papers from the pad to Terri and laced his fingers patiently in front of his face, his elbows resting on the arm rests of his chair. "I understand that, Terri said a little something of that herself." He said with a suppressed smile. "But if I'm correct about Lamaze, it will also bring you to understand each other and connect better and communicate." Travis had an unconventional spiritual belief in the connecting of the minds. "I made the appointment yesterday. For Friday evening, to give you a better time after work, Noemí." He pointedly ignored the withering look she sent his way, smiling pleasantly at both of them.</p>
		<p>Terri stood in the outside room as Noemí remained inside with Travis. "Damn you, Travis," She hissed in a low voice after closing the door to the outer room. He remained calm, staring at her as she vented her frustration. "You know well that I can't go to one of those classes. It hurts me; Amelia and I had gone-" Her voice broke and she let her head hang, her chin pressed against her chest. She took a deep breath and fought the tears that threatened to spill from her eyes.</p>
		<p>His hand touched her shoulder, and she shrugged it away. He could infuriate her so much sometimes. "I know how you feel, Noemí," He said in a low voice, knowing Noemí's pain. "But you have to face the memories and the pain. You have to move on, you're stalling." He reached to touch her shoulder again, but she stepped back, her eyes hard.</p>
		<p>She hissed at him in anger, anger that he'd gotten very used to. "Fuck you!" And stormed out of the office, barking at Terri to come with her or find her own way back home. Terri followed her with one last glance at Dr. Martin; she liked him, and she couldn't for the life of her figure out why Noemí was so angry with him when she seemed to love him so much. He smiled at her in his pleasant way; a slight nod bid her goodbye.</p>
		<p>Outside, as they walked to the spot Noemí had found to park, Terri struggled to catch up to her. Her breath shortened, and already she felt tired. Noemí's long legs took her ahead of Terri by a few feet, and she didn't notice that Terri lagged behind. "Noemí," Terri panted, her swelling legs aching. "Please, slow down."</p>
		<p>Noemí at first acted as if she didn't hear the plea, but then her straight tense shoulders hunched and her legs slowed to allow her to catch up with her. When Terri caught up to her and walked next to her, she looked up at her face. Noemí's jaw clenched as she walked at a more sedate pace; her eyes narrowed and her lips were pulled in a tight angry line. "I like Doctor Martin, Noemí." She said, trying to appease her. "He talked to me a lot, more than those doctors at the clinic."</p>
		<p>"Good for you." Noemí said shortly, as if she hadn't the care in the world for what Terri had to say. She realized that Terri lagged behind once again, and she didn't care to turn to see if she was close to her. They reached the car; she unlocked and opened the door to the passenger side for Terri. But Terri remained a few feet away, staring at her with gray brown fury. "Are you getting in any time soon?" Noemí snapped at her, unable to curb her anger. "I have things to do."</p>
		<p>Terri's stare didn't waver. "What did I do to you?" She asked, and remained standing there in the middle of the sidewalk with her arms crossed.</p>
		<p>Noemí's patience and temper flared, she felt herself loosing control. "Nothing!" She said loudly, her eyes flashing fire, momentarily scaring Terri. "Nothing," She said again. "You did nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing!" She stalked to the other side of her car and tried to slip the key into the hole, but her hands were shaking and she failed. She cursed loudly and kicked at the door viciously. By this time, people were staring, and she glared at them hard, forcing them to look away.</p>
		<p>Terri's worry grew greater than her fear of Noemí, and she watched Noemí abuse the car she seemed to love so much. "Noemí," She whispered, and moved as if to walk around the car to her.</p>
		<p>"Leave me alone, Terri." Noemí said in a low warning voice, and to Terri it felt as if all the warmth between them had turned to ice.</p>
		<p>Terri's step faltered. "Noemí, I-"</p>
		<p>"Get away from me." Noemí whispered tightly as she leaned against the car, knowing she was being unfair, feeling tired herself from the anger having its course through her body. <i>What I need right now is a drink, not comfort</i>, she thought to herself, feeling suddenly thirsty for a nice glass of warm Brandy. She felt Terri's hand on her shoulder and pushed it away, anger surfacing anew.</p>
		<p>But Terri's own anger unleashed now, and she glowered at Noemí for a long moment. "I'll leave you alone." She said coldly, turning and walking away, her back rigid with her struggle for composure.</p>
		<p>Noemí walked after her and grabbed her by the arm, yanking her around and pulling her towards the car. Her voice low and cold, she said close to her ear: "Get in the car."</p>
		<p>Terri fought against her grip, the pain searing through her arm from Noemí's fingers around it tight. "Let me go, Noemí," She said in an equally cold voice. "You are a self absorbed bitch, and I want nothing more to do with you. It was a pleasure having shared your house for one night, but I'd like to go back to my studio." She said the words in a clipped voice.</p>
		<p>"Self absorbed!" Noemí exclaimed, stopping short and flinging her arm, causing her to stagger. "Me, self absorbed, who has helped you as best as I could, who has offered you the roof of my house. <i>I'm</i> self absorbed!" Her eyes flashed with fury not directed at her, but landing on her just the same.</p>
		<p>Terri spun around and started to walk away. She felt strong hands wrap around each of her arms and jerk her against a tall muscled body. She cried out, suddenly in fear for herself and her baby, forgetting that the only person who would take hold of her that way was Noemí. An image of her large father and brothers coming at her flashed behind her eyes and she closed them tightly as her feet were almost lifted off the ground and strong arms held her tight. "My baby, please don't hurt my baby!" She moaned, feeling and not feeling Noemí's face pressing against the back of her head, her body pressing against her back. She felt her own arms pressed against her sides by the strong arms. Tears filled her eyes and her body trembled.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry," A husky voice murmured against her ear, and she recognized it as Noemí's through the fearful muddle in her mind. "Oh, God, Terri, I'm sorry! It's not you, you did nothing." She lifted her head and pressed it against the back of her head, her body shook against her.</p>
		<p>"I want to go home." Terri moaned softly, trying to free her arms from the tight grasp. "Please take me home, I can't take this." She became aware of being set back on her feet, and she turned willingly into Noemí's arms. She didn't feel the fist of anger there any more, only tenderness and apology. She felt Noemí's warm shuddery breath against her forehead and she wrapped her arms around her waist. "Why are you like this?" She asked, but Noemí didn't answer for a long time.</p>
		<p>Then she said with a heaving sigh: "You wouldn't understand, Terri," A deep tremble shook her body anew. "You would never understand."</p>
		<p>Victoria smiled when she opened the door to find Noemí standing there, but her smile faded when she saw the pallor on her best friend's skin. She pulled her into the apartment and closed the door after her. "What's going on?" She asked, pushing her towards the living room. "How is Terri? There's nothing wrong, is there?"</p>
		<p>Noemí remained quiet for a long time; she flopped down on the couch with a heavy thud. "Nothing's wrong with Terri, she's perfectly fine." She said in a whisper. "We had a little falling out."</p>
		<p>"Why?" Victoria asked, sitting down beside her.</p>
		<p>Noemí sighed and sat rigidly, anger seeming to rake through her again. "Travis, that son of a bitch, he-"</p>
		<p>"Your doctor?" Victoria asked in shock.</p>
		<p>"Yes, him," Noemí said with enough venom in her voice to kill a million people. "He suggested I go to Lamaze classes with Terri, as if he forgot that he sent me to Lamaze with Amelia."</p>
		<p>Victoria could see the method he was trying to use on Noemí. Face your memories, he'd probably said to Noemí, and Noemí had lashed out on him with her always-repressed anger. "So he did." She breathed thoughtfully, index and thumb hugging her chin. "Well, Terri needs the help, don't you think?"</p>
		<p>"Fuck what Terri needs." Noemí burst in a moment of childish rebellion, and she regretted it, because she knew that Terri wouldn't be in the current situation if it weren't for her irresponsible brother. "No, forget I said that," She waved her long fingers. "I don't know what to say. All I know is I scared the shit out of her, and she probably thought I'd hurt her like her father and brothers did."</p>
		<p>Victoria was thinking quietly. <i>Two volatile tempers in one house, oh boy!</i> "Did you apologize?" She asked in a quiet voice, knowing that wasn't always the answer. Noemí nodded and closed her eyes. "Where is she now?"</p>
		<p>"She's with mom and René, shopping baby stuff and clothes for her." Noemí replied with sigh. She leaned back against the couch, then suddenly stood up. She went to Victoria's liquor cabinet in the kitchen.</p>
		<p>As she reached in to pick out the Brandy, she felt Victoria's hand on her shoulder pulling her back. "Oh, no," Victoria said firmly. "You're not drinking now. We're going to talk, both of us nice and sober." Noemí pushed her hand away and moved back to take the bottle. Victoria, as tall as she was but not as strong, knew that Noemí could overpower easily. Still, she was willing to wrestle her to the ground if she so much as tried to have that drink. Her hand went back to her shoulder.</p>
		<p>"Stop it!" Noemí snapped at her, spinning around and shoving her away. "Don't touch me." She said in a softer tone, almost a plead, and she turned around to the cabinet again.</p>
		<p>"Noemí," Victoria said, surprised by Noemí's sudden reaction. Before she knew it, Noemí pushed her against the hallway wall, her hands grasping the front of her shirt and lifting her off her feet. Noemí brought her face close to hers and her eyes were almost unrecognizable, her anger getting the best of her; her breath quickened as she came closer to loosing total control.</p>
		<p>"Get the fuck out of here, Noemí!" Victoria hissed, her momentary fear waning in her bewilderment. "Let me go and get the fuck out of here."</p>
		<p>Noemí's eyes seemed to change as she realized what she had done. Suddenly, she let Victoria go, and before Victoria could say a word, she was through the front door and running down the driveway and continuing on down the street. <i>Shit!</i> Victoria thought to herself as she looked and reached for her keys, ran after her. Outside, she looked up and down the street frantically; there was no sight of Noemí anywhere. She ran down the block towards Metropolitan Avenue, two blocks away. An Irish bar she and Noemí had frequented since they came of age was quiet in the early afternoon, and she hoped that she would find Noemí there.</p>
		<p>Inside, a pleasant coolness and chatter replaced the warmth. Suddenly dark to her eyes, she allowed her eyes to adjust to the dim interior; looking carefully at everybody, she couldn't find Noemí there. She ran back outside, and jumped at the sound of a blaring horn. She walked down the block to go back to her apartment. She heard the blasting horn again, and turned towards its source. She recognized Michaela's car and watched as she double-parked. She leaned far in the passenger window, and kissed Michaela softly, feeling happy that she came. Michaela pulled back and looked into her eyes, sensing her distracted worry. "What's going on? Why are you running around Metropolitan Avenue?" She asked.</p>
		<p>Victoria braced herself against the roof of the car, lifting her legs and bringing them through the open window. Settling herself on the passenger seat, she sighed and brought up the passenger side window. "I'm trying to find Noemí. She's going through something right now." She replied as Michaela drove off down the street.</p>
		<p>"What's wrong with her?" Michaela, concerned, threw a side-glance at Victoria.</p>
		<p>"Well, she has memories, Michaela." Victoria said softly and shook her head. "You have to be careful about the way you say certain things to her. She remembers the accident as if it were happening to her at that same moment, and she runs away from it, turning to alcohol and anger. Today, when she went with Terri to the doctor, he suggested Noemí go to Lamaze classes with her." She kneaded the bridge of her nose with her fingers. "When Amelia was alive, they were going to the Lamaze classes. They never finished them." She heard Michaela's soft gasp of sympathy, and reached over to take her hand in hers.</p>
		<p>Michaela returned the gentle touch. "So, where to?" She asked softly.</p>
		<p>Victoria made a sound of frustration. "I don't know." She said in a soft tone. "I don't want to worry her father, but maybe I should call him. He trusts me to call him whenever something like this happens. We've been dealing with these moments for years, but we're still not used to it. We're afraid that Noemí might kill herself one day, drinking like she does and then driving." Tears stung her eyes, and she tried to fight them, winning out after a long time. She rubbed a hand over her mouth and thought hard. "Okay, she may be at Friday's; she's always liked that restaurant. I know she started going again, when she took Terri there to eat. We have a friend who works there, an old fling-"</p>
		<p>"Of yours or of Noemí's?" Michaela couldn't help but asking.</p>
		<p>Victoria looked at her for a long moment, and then said: "An old fling of <i>Noemí's</i>, before Amelia came along. This woman is still carrying a torch for her; she had been going after her since high school, until Noemí finally gave in. They became good friends after it ended between them, but I know they hadn't seen each other in a while."</p>
		<p>Michaela nodded, and made a U-turn when it became possible, driving back towards Lefferts Boulevard.</p>
