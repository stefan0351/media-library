<!-- Noemí \ Chapter Twenty-Three -->

<p>Natalie held  the baby in her arms with such love. She kissed her cold chunky cheek and did  a tiny raspberry. "Oh my goodness, she's so <i>beautiful</i>!" She exclaimed,  bringing her into the house. Noemí and Terri followed her in, hugging  Thomas and René. René reached for their coats, and walked off  with them towards the coat closet close to Thomas' study.</p>
		<p>She returned  and said to Natalie in a pleading voice: "Can I undress her, Natalie?"</p>
		<p>Natalie grinned  at her and handed her the child, who was holding herself, stiff inside the full  body coat like most babies do. René walked off with the child in her  arms, talking to her with a cooing voice.</p>
		<p>"It's my turn  next time." Natalie called after her jokingly, and turned to her daughter and  Terri. "Come in, girls, everyone else should be here in about a half-hour."  She said, throwing an arm over Terri's shoulder and grasping her daughter's  hand. "Let me warn you, every single one of them is in love with little Noemí,  and they <i>will</i> fight to carry her." She laughed softly along with them,  guiding them to the living room. She had organized a little family get together  for the baby's baptism. She had been baptized last night, but Natalie was smart  in planning the get together for the next day, Saturday.</p>
		<p>"Victoria called,  she should almost be here. Charles and Andrea should be coming along any minute."  Thomas said to Noemí, squeezing his arm around her shoulders. Noemí  nodded. "What is going on with her and Michaela? She's coming too." He inquired  of her as Terri and Natalie moved ahead of them into the living room. They stopped  and stood facing one another.</p>
		<p>Noemí  shrugged her shoulders beneath her thick sweater and smiled at him. "Vicki's  in love with her, dad," She explained, shoving her hands into the pockets of  her slacks and meeting his eyes. "She doesn't know how to tell her, she goes  speechless every time she tries to say it. She's never been in love in her life,  so she has never been in the situation of talking from her heart." She chuckled  softly.</p>
		<p>Thomas chuckled  and shook his head. "Have you tried to talk to her?" He asked, pushing his hands  into his pockets also. "Her father's talked to me, he's very worried. He and  Andrea love Michaela, and Michaela has talked with them. She loves Victoria  and she's told her, but Victoria can't seem to open up, so Michaela's frustrated  and afraid that she doesn't love her that way. Charles and Andrea can only do  so much to appease her." He looked seriously at his daughter. "Have you tried  to talk to Victoria?" He asked again.</p>
		<p>Noemí  nodded and looked at him with an amused smile. "Yes, I have," She said, reaching  up with a hand to push her growing hair away from her forehead. "She doesn't'  know what to do. She doesn't want to loose her. Every time I tell her to tell  her of her feelings, she just about has an anxiety attack. I can only talk to  her about it so much, I don't want to scare her from speaking her feelings."</p>
		<p>Thomas smiled  fondly and then looked at her closely. She seemed so relaxed, even her shoulders  had lost their rigid tenseness. Her face had softened in the past couple of  months, and smiles came more readily, reaching her eyes. "How are <i>you</i>?"  He asked softly.</p>
		<p>Noemí  smiled at him. She had told him yesterday after the baptism of her feelings  for Terri, and that they had made love. He had seemed happy, and genuinely glad  that Terri had grown to love her in that way. "I'm doing great." She said in  a low voice, looking happy indeed. "I love her more every day, dad. She's bewitched  me." Her smile was dreamy.</p>
		<p>Thomas reached  over and pulled her into a gentle embrace. "I'm so happy for you, darling."  He said with deep feeling, then pulled back and gazed at her for a long moment.  "Has she told you she loves you, dear?" He asked her, knowing from the way Noemí  talked that Terri had probably not dared say it yet. But he could see it in  her eyes that she did; he could see it in the way Terri gazed at Noemí  when she thought no one else was looking.</p>
		<p>"No, dad, she  hasn't said a thing." She answered, looking doubtful. "I think she does, I just  don't know how much. I don't know if she's <i>in</i> love with me."  She shrugged, and smiled wryly. "I'm hoping she is, though."</p>
		<p>Thomas squeezed  her shoulder gently. "She loves you, honey, I'm sure. You'll see, she'll tell  you." He reassured her and paused. "When are you telling your mother?"</p>
		<p>"Tonight, right  now." Noemí answered, and on silent agreement, they moved on down the  hall to the living room, where Terri sat holding the baby in her arms again,  conversing with both René and Natalie. Noemí smiled at her and  sat down beside her, slipping her finger into the baby's hand. She leaned down  and kissed Terri's cheek softly. "Mom," She said, taking a deep breath and meeting  her eyes. "There is something we have to tell you." René began to leave  the room. "No, René, stay here, you should know too."</p>
		<p>René turned  around to look at them curiously, her dark curls settling around her face.</p>
		<p>Natalie sat back  on her chair, taking Thomas' hand as he joined her. "What is it, dear?" She  asked, flicking her beautiful hair from her forehead with a graceful toss of  her head.</p>
		<p>Noemí  looked at Terri, who was looking at her with wide eyes. "Well, uh," She stuttered,  and then coughed. "Well, um, Terri and I, we are, uh-" She broke into a coughing  fit.</p>
		<p>Terri looked  at Natalie, who was looking at them with question in her eyes. "We're lovers."  She finished for Noemí, and watched Natalie's expression closely. Noemí  had grown silent, and was staring at her mother with wide nervous eyes.</p>
		<p>Natalie broke  into sudden laughter. "That's what you're having a problem telling me, Noemí?"  She laughed gently, standing and opening her arms to them. "Oh, honey, don't  you know that I was hoping to the powers of this earth that Terri would wake  up and see the light, as Victoria delicately puts it? You don't think I  knew that you were feeling something strong for her?"</p>
		<p>Noemí  shook her head and stood to hug her, feeling happy that her mother was not feeling  badly about this. "Oh mom, thanks, I thought you'd have a fit." She said gratefully,  kissing her cheek heartily.</p>
		<p>Natalie swatted  her shoulder gently as she pulled away, opening her arms to Terri and the baby.  "I'm so glad you opened your eyes, Terri." She said, and kissed Terri and then  the baby lingeringly on their cheeks. She then pulled back and met her eyes.  "Is this for real?" She asked in a soft voice, feeling at peace now that her  daughter had a family. Something that she would have had had she not lost Amelia  that night.</p>
		<p>Terri smiled  at her and leaned forward, whispering close to her ear. "Yes, it is for real.  I love her more than anything," She whispered with a grin. "But Noemí  doesn't know it yet."</p>
		<p>Natalie sparkled  with laughter and took her grinning granddaughter in her arms just as the bell  rang.</p>
		<p>Noemí  went to answer the door and returned with Charles and Andrea Terrence under  each arm. They crooned at little Noemí, and each took her in his and  her arms to kiss her gently. Noemí kissed Terri gently on the temple.  "I love you." She whispered close to her ear, and Terri shivered at the feel  of her warm breath against the sensitive skin of her neck.</p>
		<p>Terri pulled  back and touched her cheek softly with her hand, grinning up at her. She broke  away when Andrea and Charles greeted them. Andrea, small and thin like Terri,  hugged her hello. Victoria got her dark eyes and soft curly hair from her mother;  she was also thin like her mother, though much taller. Her height, she got from  her father, who was tall like Thomas, and burly. He took Terri into his arms  and kissed her cheek gently, pulling back and moving to Thomas. The doorbell  rang, and René left the room to go open the door.</p>
		<p>Victoria arrived  with Michaela, and they moved to hug everyone. They seemed to have already handed  their coats to René, who did not return with them. Martha arrived not  much later, a date in tow. Despite the cold temperature, as always, she was  dressed outrageously in a deep red sundress and red velvet army-style boots.  Her hair was actually a little better styled this time, pushed forward, but  dyed a bright red. Noemí moved to hug her, and eyed Martha's date with  a smile. Completely the opposite of Martha, she wore a black vest over a white  turtleneck shirt and black trousers with loafers. Thin-framed glasses were pushed  low over the bridge of her nose and her hair was long and pulled back in a loose  ponytail. She extended her hand to Noemí with a small smile. "My name  is Tanya." She said in a perfectly polite voice.</p>
		<p><i>Most definitely  preppy</i>, Noemí thought to herself as she shook her hand and introduced  herself. "Pardon me if I'm rude," Noemí said with a grin, and looked  at Martha. "Completely preppy if you ask me, I just thought you'd go for the  punk rock type of woman, cousin. I wasn't prepared for the preppy woman."</p>
		<p>Tanya laughed  softly, and Martha grinned salaciously, saying to Noemí: "Well, you know  what they say, Noemí. Opposites attract. Our sex is-"</p>
		<p>Noemí  interrupted, trying to hold back her laughter. "Might the mighty womanizer Martha  have settled down already?" She feigned wide-eyed shock.</p>
		<p>Martha swatted  at her shoulder playfully. She moved closer to Tanya, who was blushing red,  unused to their teasing banter, and took a hold of her arm. "Maybe." She blinked  her outrageously colored eyelids at Tanya fast, in a dreamy fashion, smiling  grandly.</p>
		<p>Both Noemí  and Tanya laughed, shaking their heads at Martha. "You obviously don't  know what you're getting into, Tanya." Noemí said, laughing as she shook  her hand once again.</p>
		<p>Tanya returned  her shake firmly, shaking her head and saying: "Trust me, I do know what I'm  getting into." She looked at Martha and then back at Noemí. "I'm hoping  to settle her down a little, it's about time she grew up a little." She draped  an arm over Martha's shoulders. "Oh, but trust me, I like her wild this way,  but not all the time. At home, she is the saint, she doesn't even dress  this way-"</p>
		<p>"Nonsense," Martha  cut Tanya off, wrapping her arms around Tanya's waist and pulling her close.  "You met me this way, and this way I stay." She winked at Noemí and leaned  towards her to kiss her cheek. "Say, why don't we go out later tonight?  You, Terri, Vicky and Michaela. You know mom won't mind staying with the  baby." She called Noemí's mother mom, having been very close to  her in childhood since her own mother had died when she had been a child.</p>
		<p>Noemí  shrugged, considering. "Sounds like a good idea to me." She said. "Let me talk  to Terri about it."</p>
		<p>Martha nodded,  her suspicions confirmed. Noemí and Terri were lovers, as she had suspected  when she visited a few days ago. The way their eyes met, and how they talked  as a couple, made her suspect. "Great," She said to Noemí with another  salacious wink, making her blush. "Let me know."</p>
		<p>They moved towards  the rest. Terri's back was to them, and Noemí slipped behind her and  wrapped her arms around her waist, pulling her back against her. Terri's arms  hugged Noemí's to her, and turned her face to smile at her. She pulled  out of her arms and grasped her hand, excusing them from everybody and pulling  her towards Thomas' study. Inside, she closed the big oak door behind them and  slipped into the heat of Noemí's arms slowly, wrapping her arms around  her neck. They kissed slowly and deeply for a long time. Terri pulled her lips  away slowly, and opened her eyes to gaze up into Noemí's eyes. "I missed  you." She whispered, and kissed her again, fingering the strands of hair at  the back of Noemí's head.</p>
		<p>Noemí's  arms around her tightened, and pulled her tighter against her body. Her lips  were softly demanding, her hands on her slender back caressed with a tender  firmness. She was aware of Terri's chest pressing against her own, of her thighs  pressed against hers. Their tongues met, and she pulled her lips away to look  down into her eyes. "Mm, I want to make love with you, Terri." She whispered  hoarsely, and felt Terri tremble against her, watching her close her eyes softly.  "Do you think they'll miss us if we disappear for an hour or two?" She asked  breathlessly, kissing her jaw line softly, moving down to kiss her neck.</p>
		<p>Terri threw her  head back and took a deep breath, and then she kissed Noemí's lips very  softly. "I think they'll miss us, yes." She whispered against her mouth, clasping  the back of Noemí's head, pulling her mouth harder against her own. She  felt her teeth against her mouth from the force of their kiss, and shuddered  in her arousal.</p>
		<p>Noemí's  hands were cupping her breasts, her thumbs caressing her nipples to life over  the tight silk shirt. Suddenly, she stopped, and Terri moaned her complaint,  pouting sensuously. "I want to show you my old room, when I used to live here."  Noemí whispered, meeting her eyes mischievously.</p>
		<p>Terri breathed  through her mouth, breathless at the insinuation of lovemaking that Noemí's  interest in showing her old room held. "I want to see it." She whispered, and  Noemí read clearly that she wanted to make love at all costs.</p>
		<p>Noemí  held her hand as they passed down the hall and moved towards the stairs. Natalie  was standing by the entrance to the living room, talking with Martha. Noemí  flushed a deep red as they both turned to look at her and Terri with question  in their eyes. "I'm going to show her my old room, with my trophies and all,  since you've kept it the same." She explained nervously, and pulled Terri up  the stairs quickly, not missing the look Martha and Natalie exchange.</p>
		<p>"Don't take  too long now, honey." Natalie called after them with a mischievous tone. They  heard Martha giggle.</p>
		<p>Closing the door  behind them, Terri didn't have a chance to look around the room; Noemí's  lips were upon her, her hands were all over her body, inflaming her, commanding.  She pressed her hands on Noemí's chest and pushed her back with all her  will, feeling her own throbbing. Noemí leaned forward to kiss her again,  but Terri pulled back, meeting her eyes. "I want to make love to <i>you</i>."  She whispered, and reached towards the bottom of Noemí's sweater, pulling  it up, signaling with her eyes to lift up her arms.</p>
		<p>Soon, Noemí  was standing with only her pants and boots on, her sweater and T-shirt discarded  onto her old desk's chair. Noemí moved to take Terri in her arms, but  Terri pushed against her shoulders. "No, let me look at you." She whispered,  her eyes wandering over Noemí's erect nipples, over her smooth and strong  shoulders, over her arms. "Oh God, Noemí, you're beautiful!" She gasped,  and allowed her hands to touch her arms, squeezing wonderingly as her eyes took  in the faint lines of her muscles. "You're so strong, baby." She whispered hoarsely,  and moved forward to kiss her chest with soft lips.</p>
		<p>The muscles of  Noemí's arms and shoulders clenched as she threw her head back and groaned  passionately. She felt Terri's tongue flick across the skin of her chest over  each nipple, bringing them to erect life and sending a stream of electric desire  through her body. Silky hair teased her skin as Terri's tender lips suckled  Noemí's nipples into her mouth. "Terri?" She whispered huskily,  her voice trailing off as Terri pushed her down onto her bed.</p>
		<p>Terri wanted  to straddle her, but she couldn't, her skirt was too tight against her thighs.  She laid on her, her lips possessing her nipples all over again, feeling them  engorge against her tongue. She moaned softly, feeling Noemí's hands  sift through her hair, her lips pressing against the top of her head, her low  groan as her teeth gently bit on Noemí's nipples, the clenching of her  muscles as she pushed her hips up against hers. Terri moved lower, kissing along  her stomach softly, unbuckling her belt slowly. Noemí's taut stomach  quivered as Terri's fingers deftly opened her slacks, pulling them and the boxers  down quickly.</p>
		<p>She could feel  Terri's warm labored breath against her thighs, her tongue tracing the thin  sensitive scars, her small soft hands reaching up to caress the insides reverently.  This was the first time that Noemí let her this far with her body and  let her touch her so close. Noemí sat up suddenly, and for a second Terri  thought she had changed her mind about letting her touch her, but Noemí  was bending down, yanking off her boots and the rest of her clothing. She was  panting hotly, she lay back along the bed and pulled Terri on top of her again,  kissing her passionately, tongue moving in an explorative fashion inside her  mouth, her hands moving all over her body.</p>
		<p>Terri groaned,  pressing against her, aroused by the fact that she was fully dressed and Noemí  wasn't. Suddenly, she slithered down along Noemí's body, her mouth tasting  and kissing her breasts, her stomach, lower? Noemí arched, her body  trembling violently as Terri's explorative tongue caressed between her thighs  firmly. Terri's long moan of desire sent the breath from her, her silky tongue  made Noemí shudder and undulate her hips crazily up and down. She groaned  loudly, her back arching, her hands reaching down and grasping Terri's head,  pulling her mouth tightly against her wetness.</p>
		<p>Terri tasted  and explored hungrily for a long time, savoring the taste of her orgasm; aware  of Noemí quivering against her tongue. Noemí lay spent across  the bed when Terri climbed up from between her legs, her lips trailing kisses  along her now sweaty skin. She lay beside her and kissed her neck softly, still  tasting Noemí's essence on her lips. "You taste so good." She whispered  passionately. "Why didn't you let me do this sooner?" Her hand stroked her still  quivering stomach, her head rested against her bulging biceps.</p>
		<p>After a while,  Noemí's breathing grew normal and she turned her head to kiss Terri's  lips softly, tasting herself on her. "I don't know. I didn't think you  were ready yet, I guess." She whispered, stroking cheek with a tender finger.  "I guess I was wrong."</p>
		<p>Terri smiled  and propped herself up on an elbow. "You need a shower now." She said, and kissed  her face tenderly.</p>
		<p>Noemí  sighed contentedly, and kissed her lips briefly. "And you need to wash your  face," She said teasingly, sitting up and looking at her. "And your hands, you  smell like me now."</p>
		<p>Terri licked  her lips and around them as far as her tongue could go. "I love smelling like  you, you taste so good." She whispered, moving forward to kiss her on the lips  softly. She then pulled back and looked around the room, a sudden flush of embarrassment  covering her pretty face. "Oh my God, I can't believe we just made love in your  parents' house."</p>
		<p>Noemí  laughed, throwing her head back and slapping her palm against the bed. "Please!  Do you know the women I used to bring in here before Amelia came along?" She  said with laughter. "It seems I had a brothel going on in this house, with the  traffic going in and out of my room." She shook with laughter, and Terri joined  her.</p>
		<p>"So you were  a player, eh?" Terri asked, reaching over, draping her arm over her waist and  stroking the line along her spine.</p>
		<p>Noemí  moaned softly, shivering as Terri's fingers teased the line of her spine. "Oh  yes," She said breathlessly. "And then I calmed down when I met Amelia, but  I used to bring her here too, before we moved in together. So that means I just  baptized you with my love." She winked at Terri and grinned.</p>
		<p>Terri sat up  and pushed her, making her stand up. She followed her off the bed, and wrapped  her arms around her neck. "Go take a shower, honey, I can hear your family downstairs  already. They're probably driving the baby crazy by now." She said with a chuckle.  They began to lift Noemí's discarded clothing and Noemí searched  in one of her drawers for a shirt or something she could wear to the bathroom.  She found an old bathrobe, and they both left the room to go to the bathroom.  Noemí to take a shower, Terri to wash her hands and her face. Not long  after, Noemí's hair conspicuously wet and Terri's cheeks red with warmth,  they went downstairs to be with Noemí's family.</p>
