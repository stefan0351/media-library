<!-- Noemí \ Chapter Ten -->

<p>Noemí, bent over her fourth drink, already felt lightheaded. Melanie, sitting across from her on the other side of the table, stared at her with concerned eyes. "Noemí, tell me what's wrong, please." She pleaded with her for what seemed like the fiftieth time, trying to keep her own tears from her eyes. Noemí simply stared at the glass in her hand. Melanie had been pleading off and on with her for the past hour, fortunate because there hadn't been that many customers coming into the restaurant. She looked up as her three o'clock relief came in, and she whispered to Noemí: "Come home with me, Noemí." She sighed as Noemí nodded slowly, her eyes lifting from the glass to Melanie's.</p>
		<p>Melanie smiled at her and stood up, going over to her relief; she talked in whispers with him. "Thanks." She said louder, and returned to Noemí's side. Noemí fumbled through her bills and threw money onto the table. "Come on, we can walk to my place from here." She slipped under her arm and brought it over her shoulders.</p>
		<p>Noemí staggered as she walked with her, her balance precarious as her eyes almost closed. "I should be helping you, Melanie," She slurred close to her ear, her warm breath stroking her ear and making her shiver. "Look how small you are, you can't possibly hold me up should I fall."</p>
		<p>Melanie couldn't help but laugh, and she poked her gently with an elbow. "Good things come in small packages," She said, and Noemí laughed against her, tightening her arm and sloppily kissing her temple.</p>
		<p>"I hope strength is one of those good things," Noemí bantered drunkenly, her lips pressed against her temple and unnerving her more than her closeness did.</p>
		<p>Melanie laughed, fighting with feelings of desire and many other things she rather not mention. She had known Noemí since freshman year in high school, and had been in love with her since. She had tried and tried and tried over and over again to get her to go out at least once. Finally, Noemí conceded, and made it her business to get to know Melanie. What she found out, she liked, and they soon began to go out. They had wandered away from each other after high school and more during college, each meeting new people and new lovers. Melanie had never stopped feeling deeply for Noemí, and she made sure they saw each other often, occasionally sharing a bed.</p>
		<p>It all stopped when Noemí met Amelia and fell in love. She had no eyes for anyone else, but Melanie remained her good friend. When Amelia died in that horrible accident and Melanie found out that Noemí had survived, she had felt guilty when she thought that she and Noemí could be together again. So she never sought her out, and stayed back, hearing through Victoria and then mutual friends that she was physically recovering, but that emotionally she wasn't the same any more.</p>
		<p>At her apartment, she guided Noemí to the couch.</p>
		<p>She was born of wealthy parents, and had a nice trust fund that kept her comfortable. She wanted to work outside her parents' company, but her parents would have none of it. They had indulged her when she wanted to go to college for a business degree, but had balked when she said she wanted to work outside the company, that she didn't want to follow her father's footsteps. So they had set up a trust fund, and she was now comfortable on her own. She had been working in the business district of Wall Street for a while, but the work became stressful and she quit. She then decided to work at her favorite hangout place for a while, just to take it easy from the pressures of the world.</p>
		<p>Sprawled on the couch, Noemí stared at her through glassy eyes, and Melanie stared back at her, wondering what she was thinking in her drunken stupor. She sat next to her slowly, and smiled when Noemí reached up and touched her cheek with her soft fingers. She turned her face to press her lips against the fingers touching her gently. "God, I've missed you, Noemí!" She breathed and leaned forward to kiss her lips softly. She felt Noemí respond to her, her smooth lips pressing against her own and opening to allow her tongue passage.</p>
		<p>Melanie's shaking hand moved to caress her flat stomach, moving beneath the shirt to caress the smooth skin there. She felt the muscles tighten against her palm, and a soft quiver shook her from deep within. Shifting her body, she sat astride Noemí, leaning down and meeting her lips again. Noemí's hands had a life of their own, and she caressed thighs and waist, she kneaded hips with her hands as Melanie shifted her hips down against hers. Melanie shuddered, the continuous light touch of Noemí's pelvis between her legs against the seam of her jeans aroused her anew, and she felt her wetness begin to grow. Her hand grasped Noemí's shoulders and she moved her hips to the rhythm of Noemí's hips.</p>
		<p>Noemí stopped, and sat up, pulling off her T-shirt and throwing it somewhere on the floor. She didn't bother to try to unbutton Melanie's shirt; she ripped it carelessly and yanked it off her shoulders, aware of the sudden catch in Melanie's throat. She buried her face between Melanie's ample breasts, and the familiar smell of the softly scented skin there aroused her more. She felt the alcohol in her system, but it was a secondary feeling compared to the reality of a live body pressed against her. She hadn't been with anyone since Amelia, only in her memories of Amelia, and she wondered why as she pushed them off the couch onto the floor.</p>
		<p>Their sex grew volatile, fast and hard. When Noemí's face moved between Melanie's legs, she remembered again what the feel of a woman blossoming against her tongue felt like, and the taste of a woman's sweet nectar rushing into her mouth as orgasm rocked her. Her arms around Melanie's waist were a vise-like grip that kept her mouth connected to her, her tongue anchored deep inside her. The feel of Melanie's thighs tensing violently against her shoulders rocked her body with an almost orgasmic rush; her screams were like a song in her ears.</p>
		<p>Before they knew it, hours had passed. They were sweaty by the time they stopped. Spent, not drunk anymore, she allowed Melanie to hold her, pressing her face against the hollow of her neck. Her arms were wrapped around her waist as Melanie's were around her neck, cradling her head close. Their bodies were pressed together tightly and Noemí found some comfort in that. Melanie kissed the top of her head and she whispered: "Stay the night, please."</p>
		<p>Noemí nodded slowly, and she lifted her head to kiss her. They started all over again, still fast, hard, sensuous.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Victoria stood in front of Friday's, fists against her hips. She had just been inside, and she had asked for Melanie. They told her that she had already left, alone. Victoria had been hoping that Noemí had at least left with her, but she had no way of knowing she did just that. By now, extremely nervous and frustrated, she felt tears burn her eyes. "Shit!" She muttered. She closed her eyes tightly, grateful for the feel of Michaela's arms sliding around her neck and pulling her close. "Michaela," She whispered hoarsely. "I've never let her get lost like that, I've never let her out of my sight when she's in that state of mind."</p>
		<p>"Its okay, honey, its okay." Michaela said, pulling back and wiping the tears gently from her cheeks. "You never expected her to go at you, either, my love. You were shocked."</p>
		<p>Victoria gasped as more tears stained her tanned cheeks, her hair in disarray from her fingers rushing through the silky strands over and over. "Oh, man," She said brokenly, and pulled back, pulling Michaela down the block. "We have to go to her parents' house, maybe she went there."</p>
		<p>Michaela allowed herself to be pulled and in minutes, they were walking up the driveway to the Leone's door. Thomas opened the door on the second ring. He seemed to be alone in the house, wearing silk pajama pants and a white BVD shirt. His face pinched with worry at Victoria's expression, he invited them in. Michaela introduced herself to him and he did the same, noticing the anxious worry torturing Victoria. "Victoria, dear, what is going on? Are you okay?" He asked of her, touching her shoulder.</p>
		<p>She paced back and forth in the living room, and then looked at him. "I don't know where Noemí is, Tommy. Do you?" She said suddenly.</p>
		<p>Surprised, he looked at her for a long moment before realizing what she said with her eyes. His daughter was going through another crisis. He crossed his arms over his chest, and turned away from them. "When was the last time you saw her?" He asked quietly, trying to remain calm, knowing fully well how his daughter's crisis could be.</p>
		<p>"In my place," Victoria answered him, sitting down on the couch and raking fingers through her hair once again. She brought a fist to her mouth and pounded softly against her lips, regretting having talked to Noemí in that way, no matter how surprised or angry her attack had made her. "She came to see me after dropping Terri off with Natty and René, and she was in a state. She wanted to drink, and I didn't let her. It seems Travis said a little something to her that bothered her."</p>
		<p>Thomas took a deep breath; he knew that Travis could be insensitive with his words sometimes. Almost every single time Noemí had gone to see him, she ended up upset, and Thomas knew it was because Martin tried to get her to do things that reminded her of Amelia. A plausible attempt and Thomas knew that it would someday bring his daughter back to the way she was, when she could remember Amelia without a nervous breakdown. Thomas had also known that she had been working too hard, and that she was pushing herself. "She's so sensitive, Michaela," Thomas said suddenly, turning to the pretty stranger that accompanied Victoria.</p>
		<p>Michaela smiles at him and says gently, in a strangely comforting voice: "I haven't met her yet, but I hope to soon."</p>
		<p>Thomas smiled at her; he liked her instinctively, and hoped Victoria decided to hang on to this one. He sighed and sat down beside Victoria, wrapping an arm around her shoulder. "Honey, all we can do is actually wait. Natalie should be home soon," He reassured her, though inside he trembled as hard as she outside. "We should call Noemí's house, maybe Terri will pick up." He moved to the cordless phone beside the couch and dialed.</p>
		<p>Terri picked up on the third ring; she sounded worried. "Hi, Mr. Leone, how are you?" She greeted him, sounding disappointed; she had been hoping it was Noemí calling. He returned her greeting, and she asked him before he had a chance to ask her: "Have you seen Noemí?"</p>
		<p>"No, honey, I was going to ask you the same." Thomas said, and his voice faltered. "She has not been home then?"</p>
		<p>"No," Terri replied, and she let out a long breath. "When she left me with Mrs. Leone, she wasn't in the best shape. She had a little altercation with the doctor. Mr. Leone," She said, sounding embarrassed. "What is going on? Why is she like this? Is it because I'm in her house?"</p>
		<p>"No, no, no," Thomas said with a laugh. "It hardly has anything to do with you, honey. This is something that has been happening with her for a long time. Maybe some day we can sit and talk about it. Can you call us if you hear anything from her, or if she comes home?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, you do the same." Terri said, and hung up.</p>
		<p>Victoria looked at him with red-rimmed eyes, shaking her head. "She has never gotten away from me like that." She said in a low voice, and then she stood. "We're going to her house, to wait for her there, if you hear anything, please, please, don't forget to call us, I'm worried sick."</p>
		<p>Thomas nodded and accompanied them to the door. Natalie and René arrived right as Victoria left with Michaela, climbing in Michaela's car and driving away quickly. They looked at Thomas curiously and Natalie asked, bringing bags out of the trunk: "What is going on, Thomas?"</p>
		<p>"Come inside, woman, and I'll explain." He said and walked into the house.</p>
