<!-- Noemí \ Chapter Twelve -->

<p>Her eyes closed and her face peaceful, her long lithe body relaxed, like her face. "Amelia and I were perfect together, I thought so, she thought so, everybody thought so." She began softly, and Terri looked down at her. "I loved her so much, and she loved me. My parents adored her, and so did Vicki's, Vicki introduced us, and she loved her too." She shifted lightly, but her eyes stayed closed. "When- when she died," Her voice faltered, her arm around Terri's legs jerked. "When she died, and the baby with her," Terri could see her throat bobbing, hear her voice growing thick with tears. "Oh, God, the baby, it would have been so beautiful! I loved them both more than my own life, Terri. You don't understand how much-" She broke into tears.</p>
		<p>Terri stroked her hair and her face, tears of her own burning her eyes. "I understand, trust me." She said softly. "Don't stop, maybe telling me everything will help you heal."</p>
		<p>Noemí talked for a long time, about what their life was like, up until before the accident. About the love, the peace and laughter. The phone rang numerous times, but Terri didn't want to ruin the mood and Noemí didn't seem to hear it in her voyage through her memories. She took a deep shuddering breath and her arm tightened appreciatively. "When the accident happened, it seemed I was stuck in that wreckage forever." She whispered, turning her face onto Terri's lap, as if trying to cover her eyes from the horrible image of Amelia staring blankly back at her. "She," She continued shakily, her voice muffled by Terri's legs. "She died almost right away, maybe seconds after the car stopped crashing and twisting and turning. She looked at me right afterwards, I mean, the car was crushed and all, but she turned her head to look at me. It probably took the rest of her strength to do that. Her eyes were dying already, her breath cut off by the pressure of the dashboard crushing against her chest!"</p>
		<p>Noemí sobbed loudly into Terri's lap, and Terri's hand caressed the back of her head. She couldn't help it as her own tears ran down her cheeks. "The last thing she said to me-" Noemí choked out, her shoulders heaving. "She said before her eyes went blank: 'Our baby-', and that's it, her eyes lost that beautiful light, and I could do nothing but watch. My arms were caught on something, and I was trapped, and I couldn't even touch her, or say anything!" She sobbed for a long time, while Terri touched her hair and comforted her without words. She sobbed until spent, she couldn't cry any more. Then she asked softly, tiredly: "Do you know that I'm blind from my left eye?"</p>
		<p>Terri smiled softly. "Yes," She said softly, and looked up at the window, realizing that the sun was high. She looked at the alarm clock Natalie had set up for her the evening before, and realized it was almost ten thirty. She looked down at Noemí and realized Noemí had fallen asleep, just like that, her face softened and peaceful. A tender feeling for Noemí overwhelmed Terri again, and she tried to move her legs, wanting to go get the phone and call everyone to reassure them Noemí made it home okay. Noemí made a sound deep in her throat, and her arm tightened. Little by little, slowly and softly, Terri succeeded in removing her arm from around her legs and replaced her lap with one of her thick pillows. She leaned over her as she stood beside the bed, and kissed her temple softly. She moved quickly, avoiding the broken glass on the floor and retrieved the cordless from the kitchen, walking fast back to the bedroom, where Noemí had curled up on the bed like a child.</p>
		<p>She dialed the Leone's phone number, already knowing it by memory from last night's numerous calls to the house. Thomas picked up on the first ring, and sounded immensely relieved when Terri told him that Noemí slept safely in front of her. "We had a talk, Mr. Leone," She said in a whisper, stroking Noemí's hair and gazing at her sleeping face. "A long talk, I think that is what she needed. She had too much grief bottled up inside. It was a little hairy at first, but I think I got through to her. I made sure that she knew we were all worried too."</p>
		<p>Thomas sighed contentedly, and explained Natalie the situation. Terri could hear Natalie talking quickly in her relief, and Thomas comforted her with sweet words. He turned his attention back to the Terri. "I am so glad that she has talked to you about it. She never wanted to talk every time I tried." He said with a soft sigh. "She can loose it when she's like this, and it is hard to get through to her."</p>
		<p>He could hear Terri's smile. "I've been through a lot of things myself, and I let her understand, in not so many words, that I know where she stands where pain is concerned. I think she took me seriously, I think she trusts me." She said softly.</p>
		<p>Thomas, happy, hoped his daughter might become as close to the old Noemí as possible. He loved Terri all the more for trying to help Noemí. "Thank you, Terri, I really mean it. I think you're an excellent addition to our family." He said with genuine sincerity.</p>
		<p>Terri blushed and said shyly: "Thank you, Mr. Leone, any time I can help her like she's helped me I will."</p>
		<p>"Oh, child, call me Thomas!" He exclaimed with a laugh. "Listen to me, call Victoria, she has been calling here like a maniac, trying to find out anything about Noemí."</p>
		<p>"Gladly," Terri said, and looked through her notepad, where she'd written down Victoria's phone number. She said goodbye to Thomas, and clicked over the line, dialing Victoria's number. Victoria picked up on the half ring, Terri said softly: "She's here, Victoria, and she's sleeping."</p>
		<p>"Oh, thank God!" Victoria gasped and began to cry quietly. Terri could hear Michaela on the background, and then her soft voice came on the line.</p>
		<p>Michaela's voice came very pleasant and calmer now that they knew Noemí's whereabouts. "Thank you, Terri, Victoria has been impossible all night and morning. She's been going crazy, and now she can sleep a little," She said with gratefulness. "After she rains out those tears, I'm going to make her forget about real life and then I'm putting her to sleep. Why don't I have her give you a call in a couple of hours?"</p>
		<p>Terri laughed softly. "Sounds good." She said.</p>
		<p>"Good," Michaela said, and she paused to listen to something Victoria said. "Is she okay? She didn't get hurt?" She asked Terri.</p>
		<p>Terri looked Noemí closely. "She had gotten a little drunk during the night, but other than some hickeys from unknown person, she's perfectly fine." She said with a little humor.</p>
		<p>Michaela relayed the message, and Terri could hear Victoria's muffled voice, but she couldn't understand what she said. Michaela returned to talk to Terri again. "Let's give you a call in a few hours, let her sleep a little, and then we can talk about visiting for dinner. Okay?"</p>
		<p>"Okay." Terri said and they hung up with pleasant good-byes. Terri put the phone down on the bed, and walked around to the other side, climbing into bed as carefully as possible. Noemí made a noise deep in her throat, her eyes never opened as her strong arms reached out to pull Terri to herself, burying her face against the base of her neck, sighing contentedly. Teri could do nothing but wrap her arms around her neck, resting her head against a pillow, strangely comfortable. She closed her eyes and fell asleep with ease.</p>
