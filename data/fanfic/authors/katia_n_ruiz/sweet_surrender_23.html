<!-- A Sweet Surrender \ Chapter Twenty-Two -->

<p>Cassidy lay in the circle of Andrea's arms, her arms wrapped around her waist, so spent and so sleepy. She was awake though, breathing hard and feeling the remnants of her orgasm still running through her body. They shifted and lay with the length of their bodies matching that of the bed, legs entwined, bodies pressed together tightly. Cassidy's head rested comfortably against Andrea's full chest, her lips caressing the wet skin softly. She had discarded her hospital gown and lay nude against Andrea's half-clad body. Andrea's shirt and bra had both been carelessly discarded along with Cassidy's hospital gown, but her pants remained, now wrinkled and open at the waist.</p>
		<p>"Cassidy," Andy whispered softly against her forehead, and Cassidy looked up to meet her eyes. "Are you willing to talk to me now?" She stroked Cassidy's sculpted cheek softly; each finger separated a few centimeters feeling the smooth skin tenderly. Cassidy nodded slowly, and kissed her fingers softly. "Good." Andrea said. "Why were you avoiding <i>us</i> so much?" She asked her softly, kissing her forehead tenderly.</p>
		<p>"I was afraid." Cassidy whispered, lifting her head up to look into her eyes. "You thought I was your best friend, but all the while I was head over heels in love with you." She took a deep breath, and continued: "<i>Plus</i> I wanted you with a passion that was killing me." She stopped suddenly, and broke their eye contact.</p>
		<p>"<i>Wanted</i> me?" Andrea said, trying to make a little light of the confession she'd just heard. The truth was that she wanted to jump all over the room and make a party. She was so happy. But she knew that Cassidy confessing such a deep feeling to her was something Cassidy never thought she'd be doing. "What, you don't want me any more? Got it all out of your system or something?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy laughed softly, and lifted her head to kiss Andrea's lips softly, slipping her tongue softly between the responding lips. "I still want you," She whispered sensuously. "More than ever, Andy." She kissed her again, passionately this time. Andrea wrapped her arms around her neck, her hands caressing her back softly, and fingernails raking her skin tenderly. Cassidy shivered, and whispered against her lips: "I want you more than ever, Andy. More than ever!" She groaned and lay on top of her again, pushing her breasts against Andrea's.</p>
		<p>Andrea moaned, and kissed her back, arching to the passion heating Cassidy's body. "Cassidy," She whispered softly against Cassidy's lips, groaning softly. "We're in the middle of a hospital, baby. We can't do this! You've just woken up, you're still weak?" Her voice trailed into a soft moan off as Cassidy's mouth moved down to her breasts, her teeth sinking into the flushed flesh tenderly.</p>
		<p>"I'm not too weak to do this?" She whispered against her flesh, groaning softly as Andrea's nipple blossomed against her tongue. "Am I?"</p>
		<p>"No." Andrea gasped and trembled. "Oh, God, no?" She groaned, forgetting where they were as Cassidy's mouth moved lower to her stomach and lower still.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>That evening, Ashleigh and Robie sat in a very quiet well renowned lesbian owned restaurant, sitting huddling close together talking in hushed tones. "So," Robie said, leaning towards Ashleigh with a smile. "When are you sending Cassidy home?" She closely examined the woman twelve years her senior sitting beside her. <i>Ashleigh could pass for thirty-five, my age</i>, Robie thought fleetingly. <i>Hmmm, but I like the fact that she's older. Turns me on so much.</i> She felt a shiver run up and down her spinal cord in accordance with her thoughts, and her body was warm and getting warmer.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh smiled, and touched her cheek softly, seeing the flush in Robie's cheeks. "Well, not tomorrow, or the day after." She said quietly, leaning closer and kissing her lips softly. When she pulled back, she sighed audibly, a dreamy look in her eyes. "I have to have some tests done on her. Blood work, urine, you know, the usual." She continued. "And I want to make sure the kid is mentally stable and won't try some bullshit like that again. I'm going to recommend a psychiatrist to her, and it will be up to her to go, and to Andrea to convince her. I don't want to declare her dead next time." Tears came to her eyes unexpectedly.</p>
		<p>Robie felt tears come to her own eyes, but she held them back. "We all love her so much, don't we?" She said, smiling shakily and covering Ashleigh's hand with hers. "She has one big family of lesbians, right?" She laughed softly.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh chuckled, and leaned over to kiss her again. They kissed softly for a few minutes; Robie's fingers touched Ashleigh's strong neck softly. The tender lips pressed against hers became demanding, possessive. Ashleigh pulled away slowly, and looked into her eyes meaningfully. "Robie," She whispered, and kissed her again before asking hoarsely, pressing her lips against that sensitive area right below her ear: "Would you like to come home with me?"</p>
		<p>Robie trembled all over as Ashleigh's warm breath brushed her neck and ignited her passion. She closed her eyes tightly, and whispered raggedly: "Yes?"</p>
		<p>Ashleigh didn't waste any time. She called the waitress over and asked for their check, throwing a large bill on the table and hurriedly pulling Robie out of the restaurant, not even bothering to wait for her change. The waitress was very happy to have such a big tip.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They lay nude, holding each other under the covers of Ashleigh's bed. Robie was deeply asleep, her face pressed against the arch of Ashleigh's neck, resting on her muscled arm. Ashleigh slept lightly; she was aware of the sensuously smooth body pressed against hers. The long soft leg pressed between her legs and the arm thrown carelessly over her waist aroused her anew. Ashleigh's eyes opened, the light from the lamp bothering her eyes a little, and she lifted the covers protecting them from the breeze coming through Ashleigh's forgotten open window. She couldn't take her eyes away from the smooth skin of the woman that lay in her arms, and she replayed in her mind the last few hours they'd spent frantically making love.</p>
		<p>Cassidy had never surrendered to Ashleigh in the helpless way Robie had just surrendered to her when they made love. She was more the aggressor, much to Ashleigh's pleasure, but also to her frustration. Robie was perfect, she liked being loved, and loving. It was a combination that drove Ashleigh wild; especially when Robie had lain on her back, staring at Ashleigh as she undressed with clouded passionate eyes. She had been waiting for Ashleigh to take her, sensing the need in Ashleigh to love with her body. It was not long before Ashleigh was naked, and lying on top of her, kissing her and possessing her with her hands and tongue. Their bodies had molded and moved together as if they had been made for one another.</p>
		<p>The memory of the way Robie tasted remained on Ashleigh's lips, and she licked them slowly. Pushing Robie gently onto her back slowly, not waking her just yet, she moved down slowly between her legs, wanting to imprint the taste of Robie's passion on her lips once again. Robie woke slowly to the tender teasing of her tongue, parting her legs more, and then immediately responding to the pleasure that almost immediately turned into an ecstatic orgasm.</p>
