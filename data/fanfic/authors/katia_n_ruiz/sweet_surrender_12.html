<!-- A Sweet Surrender \ Chapter Eleven -->

<p>For the next week and a half, Andrea insisted on being beside Cassidy every free minute of her days that didn't require her to be at the school teaching. Ashleigh didn't argue with her, seeing the signs that things weren't merely friendly with them. She knew something had happened on that picnic trip they'd gone on together, but it wasn't her business to ask either one of them. Cassidy would tell her in due time, she knew.</p>
		<p>Cassidy seemed glad to have Andrea close, but sometimes seemed about to push her away, to ask her to leave her. Ashleigh recognized the confused expression in her eyes, saw the look of uncertainty in her expression. Cassidy was so deeply in love with Andrea, and she didn't know what to make of the attention she received, the attention Andrea provided her with that seemed from her heart, her deepest heart. Ashleigh also knew about Cassidy's self-destructive nature, and didn't want her to make a mistake.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh, one morning, getting more curious by the minute, approached Cassidy on a friendly basis. "Cassidy," She said, sitting next to Cassidy on the bed. Cassidy was much better, already able to sit on the bed without bother and pain. She was still on oxygen support, but the thick tube had been removed when the swelling of the mostly affected lung went down. She had even braided her hair on her own, and a very long dark braid lay over her chest as she rested back against the sit-up bed. "Tell me what's wrong, Cassidy." Ashleigh said softly, taking a hold of Cassidy's hand and squeezing.</p>
		<p>Cassidy seemed to struggle within herself, her eyes went back and forth between Ashleigh and her lap. She scratched the surface on the crook of her arm, where the IV was still inserted and taped onto her. She grimaced, and Ashleigh couldn't ignore her beauty, she smiled softly. Cassidy said: "Andrea and I?" She paused, struggling visibly. "We? ah? we slept together."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh grinned, and sat back, staring at Cassidy. She suspected as much. "Cassidy!" She exclaimed after a few shocked moments. She slapped her thighs and laughed delightedly. "Isn't that what you wanted?" She asked, trying to catch her wandering eyes.</p>
		<p>Cassidy avoided her eyes. "Yes," She then said softly, finally looking up into her friend's eyes. "It is what I wanted all along, Ash." Her eyes took on a dreamy look. "I lost myself when my hands touched her; as sick as I was starting to feel, I still made love to her. I couldn't say no to her, I loved her with my body?" She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, then she opened them again to look into Ashleigh's.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh lifted her large hand to graze it across Cassidy's smooth cheek, smiling gently and comfortingly. "Do you regret it, honey?" She asked softly.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's eyes widened, and she shook her head vigorously. "No," She breathed softly, her eyes filled with tears. "I just do not know what to do about it, I love her so much!"</p>
		<p>Ashleigh leaned towards her, caressing her cheek with the palm of her hand. Cassidy pressed her face onto her palm, and shivered slightly. "What do you mean you don't know what to do about it?" Ashleigh asked her friend.</p>
		<p>Cassidy shook her head, closing her eyes. "I love her more than anything in this world, Ashleigh." She said in a low voice. "I don't know what to do. I want her to be mine, but she is Jeffrey's."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh made a low annoyed sound. "You're so willing to give her up, Cassidy." She said, sitting back and resting her hands on her own lap. She studied Cassidy with knowing eyes. "She hasn't even been faced with Jeffrey, and you're already assuming that she'll go running back to him as soon as he comes back!" Ashleigh really disliked Jeffrey Rosenthal. One could tell by the disgusted curl of her upper lip as she replied to what she knew was a foolish answer from Cassidy. "Tell me," She said vehemently in her anger. "How was she when you made love to her? When she was in your arms? Did she call out his name, did it seem she felt guilty?" She knew she was being a little rash and crude, but she was really angry with Cassidy and her cowardice.</p>
		<p>"Ashleigh!" Cassidy said reproachfully, blushing violently.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh laughed until her eyes watered. "And since when are you the prude?" She demanded thickly. "Since when? You, who made love to me with a <i>wine bottle</i> of all things!" She laughed again, punching her lightly in the stomach. She saw Cassidy's blushing expression, and laughed all the harder. In a few moments, her laughter died away and she grinned at her friend, her perfect row of teeth flashing. "Really, Cassidy," She said soothingly. "Tell me, when she was in your arms, how did she react? Was she calling out <i>his</i> name?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy's flush remained, but this time it wasn't from embarrassment. Body memory was at an all time high now, and she was recalling the feel of Andrea's skin against hers, against her palms. The fervor of her cries and intermittently, her ecstatic orgasms. She closed her eyes, and she swore she could see the flush of the pale skin of Andrea's body as she gazed at it, as her mouth and tongue stroked it. She recalled the ecstasy of the deep guttural cries Andrea let forth, it was as if Andrea were calling her name out once again with her throaty shaky voice. "She was utterly mine, Ashleigh." Cassidy said hoarsely, feeling a hard lump in her throat, her body flushing with heat and a cold sweat prickling her body all over.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh smiled knowingly. "Is your love for her threatened? Do you think you'd ever stop loving her?" She asked.</p>
		<p>Cassidy swallowed hard, and gazed at Ashleigh. "I'll never stop loving her, Ashleigh." She said softly. "I'm more in love with her than ever."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh made a fist and punched the hard thigh under the covers. "Then seduce her again, make her love you the way you love her." She suggested heatedly. "And see how fast she'll leave that bastard that calls himself her boyfriend."</p>
		<p>Cassidy didn't know what to say. She remained quiet, and gazed at Ashleigh, knowing she was right. She was being a coward.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Andrea smiled at her students as the bell rang, and lowered her upturned hand, which held the small piece of chalk against the dark green chalkboard. Her students, mixed from Hispanic to Caucasian, jumped uniformly to their feet and began filing out of the classroom, not forgetting to say goodbye to their favorite teacher. Roseanne went towards her without hesitation, smiling her radiant smile, tinted with worry. Andrea grinned at her with loving friendly and motherly eyes.</p>
		<p>Roseanne stood by the desk, wanting to talk to Andrea about things, not knowing how to start. She never really felt she couldn't talk to Andrea, but today, she was extremely shy. "Ms. Cates," She said in a low voice. "May I speak with you?" She avoided her eyes.</p>
		<p>Andrea became instantly concerned, and she looked closely at her young student and friend. Roseanne never avoided her eyes and was never shy. "What is going on?" She asked, gesturing for her to sit down and sitting down herself behind the desk. When Roseanne merely stared at the table in front of her and said nothing, she pressed: "Spill it, girl!"</p>
		<p>Roseanne's eyes snapped up to hers, and they widened. "I'm having a little problem."</p>
		<p>Andrea tilted her head sideways, frowning softly. She sat forward and brought her hands together over the desk. "And that is?" She inquired.</p>
		<p>"Um," Roseanne said. "You remember how I told the whole world I had a crush on Manuela Montero?"</p>
		<p>Andrea chuckled. "I remember very well." She said. She made a gesture with her hand, a gesture for her to continue. "Go on."</p>
		<p>"Well," Roseanne paused. "I do and everything, and she came up to me afterwards, and we're sort of talking." She paused, and scratched at the surface of the desk with a short fingernail.</p>
		<p>Andrea could sense the "but" at the end of that sentence. "But?" She prodded, getting a little impatient with her friend and student.</p>
		<p>Roseanne sat back on her chair, and made eye contact with Andrea, deciding to stop wasting time. "Jenya Field," She said. "The cheerleader?"</p>
		<p>Andrea made an impatient gesture. "Sure, I know who she is, honey. <i>Do</i> go on!" She pushed.</p>
		<p>"Well, she? ah? approached me last week and asked me out on a date." Roseanne continued her tale. "I accepted."</p>
		<p>Andrea sat back with wide eyes, a drama seemed to be unfolding. "Wow." Was all she could say.</p>
		<p>Roseanne nodded in silent agreement. "I like both of them, they're both exciting to hang out with. And they both know about the other, and seem to be making it harder for me to decide." She said quickly, seeking advice from the only other person who could give her; the first being her mother, who with so much work on her shoulders, sometimes couldn't even stop her bustling to say hello. Her eyes were wide and innocent in her turmoil.</p>
		<p>Andrea leaned forward again, and looked at Roseanne with a loving expression. "Why do you have to decide?" Andrea asked, smiling. "Enjoy both their company, Roseanne, as long as both girls know what's going on. Ask them not to pressure you, dear. You have all the time in the world for these kind of decisions." She paused as she saw a slight flicker of relief fall across Roseanne's expression. "You're only fifteen, honey."</p>
		<p>"You think they would accept for me see both of them?" Roseanne asked, leaning forward eagerly, blue eyes wide.</p>
		<p>Andrea laughed softly, and reached out to stroke her hand softly. "Yes," She said. "If they like you so much, they'll allow you to make your own decision at the right time, don't you think?"</p>
		<p>Roseanne nodded, beaming. "Cool!" She said, jumping to her feet. "That's exactly what my mother said! Well, not exactly said. I used a hypothetical friend."</p>
		<p>Andrea laughed loudly. "And why are you asking <i>me</i>, then?" She demanded good-naturedly, standing also.</p>
		<p>"Because mothers can sometimes be wrong," Roseanne said. "Now I know she was right, if you say the same, then she's right." She reached for her bag and said: "I'll see you later, at study period?"</p>
		<p>Andrea smiled and nodded. "Okay." She watched her young friend walk out with her usual bounce.</p>
