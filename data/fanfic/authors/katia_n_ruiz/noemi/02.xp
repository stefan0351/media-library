		<p>Friday's was like any other restaurant, but like few, it had a bar also. Noemí had not been there in a few years, since Amelia passed away. But today, there were important matters to discuss, and this was the place that brought her peace despite its often-noisy crowds and her memories. Noemí, as they wait for the matron to come to greet them, studied Terri. "Do you want something to eat?" She asked, and thought she saw Terri's eyes light up at the idea of lunch. "Okay," She said, smiling softly. "You'll enjoy the food here."</p>
		<p>The matron, a short red headed woman was heading their way, and she smiled at Noemí in recognition. "Noemí! Long time!" She exclaimed, sounding very happy indeed to see her. Her brown eyes traveled the length of Noemí's body, and the heated look she gave her was not lost on Terri.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled at the woman, and moved forward to hug her. "Melanie. How are you?" She said warmly, giving her a kiss on the cheek. Then she looked her up and down. "You look great."</p>
		<p>Melanie flushed with pleasure, pulling back and slapping Noemí's arm gently. "Fine, fine. Got a promotion since the last time you were here, as you can see." She replied, gesturing for them to follow her and guiding them to the back, where most of the eating area was. She looked Terri over briefly and then shot Noemí a questioning look.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled at her and shook her head in answer. Melanie's smile grew, and she handed them each a menu. "See you later, then." She said, and turns to go. It seemed she thought of something else, because she turned back to Noemí. "Does this mean you're back?" She asked in very suggestive tone.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled, and pulled out her business card from her wallet, handing it over to Melanie. "Give me a call Monday, maybe we can have dinner somewhere." Was all she said, and this pleased Melanie, because she beamed as she left them to do her job.</p>
		<p>Terri stared at Noemí curiously and Noemí met her eyes. "Old friend?" She asked.</p>
		<p>"Yes," Noemí replied, and looked down at her menu with a heavy sigh. "Old, <i>old</i> friend."</p>
		<p>Terri slightly pursed her lips and looked down at the menu, looking through the plastic coated pages. "I don't know what I should have." She said after a while, and Noemí smiled at her.</p>
		<p>She looked at her own menu and then at Terri. "How about some steak?" She suggested, and Terri looked up at her with wide eyes. "With mashed potatoes?" She stopped and looked at her with concern. "Is something wrong?"</p>
		<p>Terri looked away from her. "Uh, nothing." She stuttered. "I just never have any meat, that's all."</p>
		<p>"Are you a vegetarian?" Noemí asked.</p>
		<p>Terri flushed a deep shade of red, and braved a look at Noemí. Noemí was now studying the menu for something without meat. "I can't <i>afford</i> it all the time." She said with difficulty.</p>
		<p>Noemí was speechless, and she felt like an insensitive jerk. "Sorry, I didn't think." She apologized just as the waiter came to their table with his little notepad and pen in hand. She ordered a steak and mashed potatoes with orange juice for Terri and a chicken salad with a Vodka mix for herself. He smiled at them and took away the menus. "It doesn't have to be that way, Terri," She said to her in a confidential tone of voice. "You can have anything you want, if you'd only put that pride to sleep for a while. Like it or not, you're stuck with us." Leaning forward, her elbows on the table, she pointed a slender finger down at her womb. "That child inside you is my parents' grandchild and my niece or nephew." She whispered fiercely. "You can't only think about yourself now. You have another life inside you now that you have to think about, and we can provide for you and your child what you can't right now." She paused and studied Terri's expression for a reaction.</p>
		<p>Terri whimpered very softly, and half turned away from Noemí, she could feel a light sweat break out all over her body. She trembled and wrapped her arms around herself. "I don't want you take my baby away from me." She whispered softly.</p>
		<p>Noemí stared at her, at first confused, and then realization dawned on her. Feeling horrified that Terri had assumed that they would want to take her baby away from her, she shook her head. "No," She whispered softly, bending forward more. "No! That's not what we want, Terri. We want to be there for this baby. We want it to know it has family, to have our last name. We don't want it to ever need anything. Don't you <i>understand</i>? Don't you feel the same <i>way</i>? Don't you want a family?" Terri met her eyes again, and nodded very slowly, almost imperceptibly, and Noemí sighed. "Then won't you at least think about it?" She asked softly.</p>
		<p>Terri looked down at the table, and whispered: "I'll think about it." She twisted in her seat, and was sitting facing Noemí again, looking at her with guarded eyes.</p>
		<p>Noemí sat back and met her eyes. "My mother wants me to go with you to your first visit with our family doctor." She said.</p>
		<p>"It seems you discussed a lot about me without talking to me." Terri said defensively, narrowing her eyes. <i>Now they're trying to control my life.</i> She thought, feeling a little angry.</p>
		<p>"No, no, you don't understand." Noemí said, sounding a little irritated. "It is only if you want me to go, if you want to get to know me. She likes you already, Terri, she believes you when you say that you are the mother of her grandchild."</p>
		<p>Terri looked directly into her eyes. "You don't?" She asked.</p>
		<p>Noemí sat back. "That will be proven when that child is born." She answers her accusation evasively.</p>
		<p>Terri shook her head, and laughed softly. "What is it about your bloodline that will let you know who is a Leone and who is not?" She asked sarcastically.</p>
		<p>Noemí leaned forward again, and moved a hand to stroke her hair by an area on the right side of the top of her head close to her forehead, which sent her hair slightly to the left side. "You see this little part here?" She asked, fingering it and eyeing Terri closely. Terri nodded; she'd seen the same part on the same area of Anthony's head. "This is the Leone hair part, not one child in our family is born who doesn't have this; unless for some reason or another that baby ends up not being a Leone. Call us foolish, but it is true. We haven't had a case like that in a long time, but you see..."</p>
		<p>Relaxing a little, Terri smiled. "But what if it comes out with <i>my</i> part?" She asked teasingly.</p>
		<p>"Our bloodline runs deep in every Leone." Noemí said proudly, sitting back again. "We have beauty marks in certain areas of our bodies," She cleared her throat. "You would know."</p>
		<p>Terri's smile faded, and she looked away. Their food arrived, and they proceeded to eat silently. Noemí hardly touched her salad, and nursed her drink carefully. By the time Terri finished with her lunch, stuffed to capacity, Noemí had finished three drinks. Terri noticed the way her eyes are slightly unfocused, and that she now blinked very slowly. "Have you thought of my offer to stay in my house?" She asked suddenly, her words ran together a little.</p>
		<p>"Yes." Terri answered as the waiter came back around and removed her plate, and Noemí's barely touched plate.</p>
		<p>"Bring the check." Noemí said and the waiter nodded. She looked at Terri, and closed her eyes for a second. "Yes, you've thought about it, or yes, you accept my offer?" She asked very slowly.</p>
		<p>"I accept." Terri said recklessly, and looked down at the tabletop shyly. Noemí smiled.</p>
		<p>The check arrived, and Noemí pulled out a few bills from her wallet and throws them on the table, standing up. She almost lurched away from the table, and Terri followed her out to the street. She followed Noemí back the way they came, and walked silently beside her as Noemí walked along, seemingly thinking deeply about something. She was a little drunk, Terri could see. They turned on the street her parents lived in, and Noemí took her elbow and guided her the rest of the way. She pulled out her key chain from her pocket and slipped a key into the hole.</p>
		<p>As she walked through the front door, Terri's eyes widened in awe as she studied the beautiful interior. Everything was made of wood, a dark wood that shone brilliantly and cleanly. She stumbled over her own feet as she looked into the living room, and Noemí held her up. "Be careful." She whispered good-naturedly.</p>
		<p>Terri looked at her with glassy eyes, her mouth parted slightly. "This is wonderful." She whispered back, and continued to look all around. Noemí chuckled softly, and called out to her father. He called back from somewhere down the hall and she guided Terri into his study. Terri couldn't hold back the gasp that came forth.</p>
		<p>There were books, on shelves that covered all of the walls from floor to ceiling. Soft classical music came from hidden speakers around the room. Natalie sat on a large rocking chair by the large window; her knitting rested on her lap as her small hands did the work. Thomas sat behind his huge desk, leaning back on his chair, a large book sitting across his lap. He pulled off his glasses, and sat forward, smiling a welcome at Terri. "Hello there." He said softly, standing up and walking around the desk. He smiled down at her reassuringly. "You're feeling better now, I trust?"</p>
		<p>Terri nodded, and was surprised when Natalie comes to her and kissed her cheek. She'd never known such gentle mannered people in her life. <i>Anthony doesn't know how lucky he is</i>, she thought fleetingly, allowing their caring demeanor take her in. "Sit down, sit down." Natalie told her and guided her to one of the chairs.</p>
		<p>Noemí went to the window and stared out, sitting on the custom made seat right in front of it. "She has accepted the offer to live in my house." She said quietly, and Thomas seemed very happy, even going so far as to leaning down and hugging Terri with his big bulk.</p>
		<p>"Smart girl." He said, and goes to sit behind his desk. "Good job, Noemí."</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled softly at him, and turned her face again to stare out the window into the beautiful afternoon.</p>
		<p>Natalie sat on the other chair, and gazed at Terri with a gentle smile. Terri blushed, and she looked down at her lap. "What's the matter?" Natalie asked softly, leaning forward and touching her arm gently.</p>
		<p>Terri looked at her, her eyes glassy with suppressed tears. She felt Thomas and Noemí's eyes on her and was uncomfortable. "I've never been offered this type of comfort." She said uneasily, trying to keep her voice from shaking.</p>
		<p>Natalie scoffed tenderly, and leaned back in her seat. "This is only the beginning child. By the time we're done with you, you will never want us to go away." She said with a small laugh. "We're very lovable people, you know."</p>
		<p>Terri believed her with all her heart, and she did her best not to find them irresistibly lovable. "It makes me wonder what happened with Anthony." She said suddenly, not thinking, and was met with a warm smile from Thomas.</p>
		<p>"I often wonder that myself." He said reassuringly, then he looked at her stomach. "You're not showing much, yet." He continued, and she instinctively pressed her hands to her hardening stomach.</p>
		<p>Natalie waved him off, and leaned over to touch her arm again. She whispered in a confidential tone, a twinkle in her eye: "He doesn't know much about pregnant women. I wouldn't let him <i>near</i> me when I was pregnant with my babies." Terri can't help but laugh, and covered her mouth. Natalie looked happy at having made her laugh, and said condescendingly to Thomas: "She's only four months along, Thomas. Wait another two months, and she'll be a balloon." Thomas broke out in laughter.</p>
		<p>"Balloon?" Terri whispered, wide-eyed.</p>
		<p>Noemí laughed softly, and stood behind Terri's chair. "Mom, you're scaring her. Stop it." She said in a mock stern tone, and Natalie laughed softly. "You should know, Terri," She said, placing a now gentle hand on her shoulder, unnerving her. "That it is only natural for a pregnant woman to blow up after some time. But once they give birth, most go back to their original look, with a few more enticing curves." She smiled down at Terri when she twisted to look up at her curiously. She lifted her eyes from Terri's and looked at her mother again. "She's a painter, mom." She said to Natalie, who smiled brightly upon hearing that. "Really excellent."</p>
		<p>Before Natalie could say a thing, Terri was shaking her head and saying in a self-deprecating manner: "Oh, nothing big, Mrs. Leone, only watercolors."</p>
		<p>"That is bull, mom," Noemí said with a low husky laugh. "She is good. As soon as you get the chance, mom, since you know all the painters in New York, I want you to get her canvas and whatever else painters use."</p>
		<p>Natalie surprised Terri by saying: "Why of course, as soon as you get her settled into your house."</p>
		<p>Terri stared at her then stood up abruptly. She looked at Noemí for a long time. "I'd like to go home now, please. I'm very tired." She whispered softly, her eyes watery and reddish. She looked like she was about to cry, but she made it past their already loving good-byes and out of the house. She sat pensively in Noemí's car, and waited for her to join her in the vehicle.</p>
		<p>A few minutes later, Noemí came and got into the car, slipping the key in the ignition hole and starting the car. Her parents had already closed the door behind them, and Noemí sat quietly in the car. Suddenly, she twisted around and looked at her for a long time. She reached over and touched Terri's shoulder softly. "I know my parents can be overwhelming sometimes-"</p>
		<p>"No," Terri cut her off with a husky voice, trying to hold back the tears that were threatening. "They're wonderful. I always wished my dad were like yours is, and that my mom hadn't died and left me with him. I imagine she would have been like your mother." She laughed softly, and it sounded like a half-suppressed sob. She pressed the back of her hand against her mouth, and a tear slipped out. She wiped at it, and said with an attempt at levity: "But it looks like our brothers were cut of the same paper, eh?"</p>
		<p>Noemí joined in her laughter, trying to let her compose herself, and she straightened in her seat, slipping on her seatbelt. She twisted again, and putting her arm behind the passenger seat, brought the car in reverse onto the street. With a lurch, they moved forward down the street onto Queens Boulevard. Terri fell asleep as Noemí drove her home.</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Six">
		<p>Michaela cuddled in Victoria's arms; they were sitting up on her bed, talking. They had barely been apart since the day they met a week ago, only separating when both women had to go to work; they'd been together every single night since then. Every time Victoria returned to the apartment, she always found Michaela curled up on the couch, the television still on, either deeply asleep, or calmly watching television. Victoria always felt as tired as Michaela, but she always woke her or took her attention away from the television to make love again. Today, it had turned dark before they even realized it. They decided to give sex a rest and to talk and get to know each other. "Tell me about Noemí." Michaela said in her bossy tone.</p>
		<p>Victoria pulled back and smiled down at her. "Jesus, can't you calm down with the bossiness? I'm not one of those people," She said jokingly. "I don't take orders." They both knew that Michaela's assertive nature aroused Victoria to the point of submission; something she'd never felt before.</p>
		<p>Michaela slapped her arm gently. "Shut up." She said softly. "Now tell me about Noemí. Why is she so important to you?" Victoria studied her for a long time, trying to discern if Michaela was jealous or obsessive or any of those excuses she'd used before to get rid of one woman or another. All that she could come up with as she looked at her was that Michaela was wonderful. <i>Oh my god, those lips!</i> Victoria thinks to herself as her gaze turns hot. "Tell me." Michaela said, smiling teasingly at the look in Victoria's eyes; she seemed genuinely curious about Noemí in the 'I want to know your life' kind of way.</p>
		<p>"Well," Victoria whispered, stroking her hair gently. "Noemí and I grew up practically together. My father is her father's best friend, and surprisingly, my mother is her mother's best friend." She sighed, and looked up at the reflections of the lights outside on the walls. "Dad is the police commissioner, mom his secretary. Dad and Thomas have known each other for more than thirty years. I'm older than Noemí by about a year, but as soon as she was born, according to our parents' accounts, I was endeared by those eyes." She laughed softly. "We grew up right next to each other, next door neighbors. My parents still live in the next house; they're on vacation right now. So we grew up together, went to Catholic girls' school together. We did so many things together to the other kids," She said with a small laugh. "We were the pranksters, everybody was scared of us. And we've never had a single fight with each other."</p>
		<p>"Sounds wonderful," Michaela said with a tender kiss on Victoria's chin. She looked up at her and saw her smile fade. "What is it?"</p>
		<p>Victoria's lips twisted as she thought about the events of years ago. "Well, everything was fine. It's just that Noemí has changed a lot, she's not the person she was five years ago." She paused and took a deep breath. Michaela waited silently, allowing her tell their tale at her own pace. "Almost eight years ago, I introduced her to Amelia, she was a fellow accountant. Beautiful, like a princess, and sweet and tender like a baby's butt." Michaela smiled at the comparison. "Noemí fell in love with her right away, and Amelia fell hard for Noemí too. They were so happy." Her voice broke and tears filled her eyes.</p>
		<p>Michaela sat up and touched her cheek gently with a hand. She kissed away her tears and crooned gently in her ear. She felt Victoria's arms wind tightly around her. Victoria got a hold of herself and she cleared her throat to continue. "Well, they used to go away on the weekends, a <i>lot</i>, and I used to go with them sometimes. That last time I went with them, a group of us friends went together. It was Providence Town; we had the greatest time there. And when we were coming home, they were rammed by some asshole in a truck and they went down a ditch-" Her voice broke again, and she cried the tears she never cried. "Shit," She whispered after a few minutes, stiffening and pulling away from Michaela. She felt uneasy, never being one to cry in front of women that way, except maybe her mother and Noemí. She didn't like showing her vulnerability, but Michaela did that to her. Made her feel vulnerable with her gentle caring.</p>
		<p>"Oh, baby, its okay." Michaela said, sensing the truth of her discomfort. "You don't have to hide anything from me." She lay down in her arms again, and felt Victoria reluctantly yield to her again. "Tell me the rest."</p>
		<p>"Amelia was pregnant," Victoria sobbed, and couldn't help the tears that fell from her eyes. She continued with the tears flowing freely, her voice breaking over and over: "Oh, God, they wanted that child practically from the beginning of their relationship, and I wanted it right with them. I wanted it just as badly, if not more. Because Noemí and I always promised each other that we would be each other's children's godmothers, and that would have been my godchild. It was our project, that baby."</p>
		<p>"Oh, honey," Michaela whispered, tears of her own staining her cheeks.</p>
		<p>"We were all so devastated," Victoria whispered back, trembling against her and crying. "Amelia and the baby died right away, and Noemí was stuck in that goddamn car for hours, pressed right against Amelia's body, almost dying herself. It was such an experience, God." She trembled even harder. "I was with them on that trip, three friends of ours were in my car. Noemí's car was a two-seater, and mine was bigger. All of us saw the accident happen, and I thought I'd lost my best friend then! I almost went crazy." She cried again, reliving the fear of that accident. "I lost her, kind of. She was almost dead when they could finally get her out of that car; she almost lost her right arm. She has this big scar on her arm from the dash crushing her to Amelia, and a big one on her left thigh from the car crumpling and pressing her from the left. Every time I see them, I remember. She's blind on her left eye because of the goddamn bastard!"</p>
		<p>"Oh, baby." Michaela whispered, and held her tighter. "How is Noemí dealing with it?" She asked gently.</p>
		<p>"She drinks," Victoria said shortly, shaking her head and pressing her face into Michaela's soft throat. "Exercises... and works herself to near exhaustion. She doesn't sleep, has nightmares every single time she closes her eyes."</p>
		<p>"She talk to you about it?" Michaela asked, and sat up, brushing her fingers through Victoria's hair.</p>
		<p>Victoria nodded and closed her eyes to the comforting feeling of Michaela's fingers in her hair. "Yes, not often, but she does." She whispered. "I have nightmares myself, from time to time. Of course, not as bad as hers, but I can swear I still see the car falling off into that ditch." She stayed quiet for a long moment, gazing into space. Then she suddenly pulled Michaela down and they forgot everything, as they once again lost their senses in one another.</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Seven">
		<p>Her interoffice line rang, and Noemí reached over for the receiver. "Hello," She said distractedly, kneading the bridge of her nose with her thumb and index fingers.</p>
		<p>"Noemí, Melanie is on line one for you." Her secretary said.</p>
		<p>With a soft smile, Noemí said: "Put her through."</p>
		<p>"Hi, Noemí." Melanie said, sounding glad to hear her voice. "How are you?"</p>
		<p>Leaning back on her seat, Noemí twirled her pen between her fingers. "I am fine, and yourself?" She replied.</p>
		<p>"Doing well," Melanie said, and sighed. She said nothing for a long moment, and Noemí could hear her breathing softly on the other end. "So when can we have dinner?" She now sounded a little nervous.</p>
		<p>Noemí thought about it. "Tonight after I get out of the office, if you like." She said, on an impulse.</p>
		<p>Melanie laughed delightedly. "Sounds like a great idea to me." She agreed, and they set a time and place to meet.</p>
		<p>Noemí leaned back on her chair, and spun around to stare out the windows at the blue sky, smiling as she thought about her younger days. Those days when everything was fun and uncomplicated, when death couldn't touch her or hurt her. Her smile faded as her memories returned to Amelia, the only woman that made her heart do a dance in her chest. She closed her eyes softly, and imagined that she could still feel Amelia's lips brush hers softly, hear her voice telling her she loved her. Feel her hands touching her arms and back reverently, their bodies dancing against one another as they made passionate love.</p>
		<p>The phone rang, and she started from her thoughts, spinning her chair to reach for the receiver again, welcoming the distraction.</p>
		<p>Noemí sat across from Melanie, looking like a commercial for fashion. Her work clothes had no wrinkles, her shirt had the top three buttons undone, and Melanie couldn't help but gaze at her with desire. Noemí had always had that effect on her; she had always made her feel this way, this breathless feeling of want and heat. She gazed at her as she talked about everything that had happened to her all those years since they last saw each other. "Tell me about you, Noemí. How are you?" She said, wanting to hear her voice.</p>
		<p>Noemí leaned forward, resting an arm on the table, and her smile faded a little. "I'd rather talk about you." She said evasively, looking down at the table.</p>
		<p>"You'd rather not talk about what's happened with you?" Melanie said softly, reaching over and touching the back of her hand with soft and slender fingers. "Why?" She knew why, but she wanted to hear Noemí's version of things.</p>
		<p>Noemí narrowed her eyes, and she looked down at Melanie's fingers touching her hand. "Come on, Melanie," She said softly, looking up to meet her eyes. "You know why, and I know that you know, things get around in our circle more than we'd like."</p>
		<p>Melanie smiled softly, brushing her hair from her forehead with her other hand. She'd heard about Noemí's accident from a lot of people, and about how her lover had died. She had shown up at the hospital every day during that first month when Noemí had been in a coma, and Victoria had been her contact. Once it was known that Noemí would recover, she had stopped going, not having the courage to face her, knowing that to Noemí it would make no difference whether she was there or not. "I know, Noemí." She said. "I just wanted to hear it from you."</p>
		<p>Noemí shrugged, shaking her head. "I'm not good at talking about it, I'm sorry." She said huskily.</p>
		<p>Melanie pulled her hand away, and smiled at her. "You don't have to then, unless you feel like you should. Remember that I'm always here no matter what." She reassured her.</p>
		<p>Noemí nodded and smiled, and everything felt all right again. Their food arrived and they began to eat. Noemí asked her about her family, and Melanie answered her eagerly, happy to have her close again. </p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Eight">
		<p>Noemí sat in her office, immersed in paperwork and company statistics, when the private line rang. She absently picked it up, her eyes never leaving the pages in front of her. Terri's voice brought her out of her thoughts of numbers and words; she sounded distressed. For the past week and a half, they have talked every day, Terri checking in with her, as agreed with Thomas and Natalie. Still reluctant to move into the house, Terri procrastinated on making a decision for which day she would move. Noemí kept arguing with her every day, on the verge of loosing her patience. "What's up?" She asked, pulling off her thin-frame reading glasses.</p>
		<p>There was some background sound, and Noemí could tell she was outside somewhere. She stood and moved around the desk, stretching her back.</p>
		<p>"I don't know if we should do this, Noemí. I mean, I'm the kind of person who takes her time with everything, and you like things done fast. I don't know if I can deal with you." Terri found another excuse, another silly one.</p>
		<p>Noemí threw her reading glasses down on the desk, and leaned back on the desk with an annoyed sigh, crossing her arms and holding the phone between her ear and shoulder. "Look, Terri, we agreed that you would move in, and every single day of this month, you have been jerking me around about the date that you want to move in." Noemí said in a quiet monotone, sounding very irritated indeed. "Every time I ask you if you want an apartment by yourself then, you say no, when I ask if you prefer to live in my house then, with my company to help you if any problem arises, you say you don't know. </p>
		<p>"Now, today, when I get out of here," She looked at her watch. "In an hour and a half, I'm going to pass by your apartment to pick you up for good. If you're thinking about your child, then you will be ready with your belongings. I am very tired. Do we understand each other, Terri? <i>Also</i>," She said with great emphasis. "I am taking the day off <i>tomorrow</i>, so that <i>we</i> can go to the family doctor, so that he can take a good look at you. You have been avoiding the subject."</p>
		<p>Terri remained silent for a few seconds, and then she said: "Okay, I will be ready." She paused hesitantly. "Can I bring my drawings?" She asked shyly.</p>
		<p>Noemí's smile was more like a grimace and pinched the bridge of her nose with her index finger and thumb. <i>This woman is something!</i> "You can bring anything short of bed and chairs." She said huskily. "You won't need any of that any more, you will have anything you want from now on. I promise you that." She had already bought her the most comfortable king-sized canopy bed and installed it herself the same day of the purchase and delivery. Her mother, who had always had the eye for art, had taken charge of the decorations in the room; she decorated it as she saw fit for Terri.</p>
		<p>Terri remained quiet again, but then she said in a low voice: "I'll be ready when you get here. I don't have that much anyway, and the tables and bed belong to the apartment."</p>
		<p>When they hung up, Noemí leaned back on her chair and relaxed, kneading her eyes tiredly. She sighed and reached for the phone. She dialed and René answered on the second ring. "René, let me talk to mom, please." She said after pleasantries.</p>
		<p>"Sure, honey." She said. "Tell me something, when am I going to meet that lovely young woman Natalie talks so much about? The mother of little Anthony's child."</p>
		<p>Noemí chuckled softly. Terri had only been there that first day, and always avoided the subject of returning. Noemí knew that she liked her parents, but that she didn't want to like them too much. "Anthony is hardly a little kid any more." She said. "And I'm trying to get mom to take her somewhere to buy clothes or something. Maybe mom will take you, if you ask her."</p>
		<p>René sounded pleased with that prospect. She put the phone down and minutes later, Natalie came on the phone; she sounded out of breath. "What is the matter, honey? Is something wrong?" Was the first thing she asked; everything in her mind for the past month had been Terri and the baby. Every time Noemí had called, the first few minutes were spent with Noemí reassuring her that Terri was fine, and that all she wanted was to hear her pleasant motherly voice. Today, she'd be giving her good news.</p>
		<p>"Everything is fine." Noemí said with a laugh. "I have good news for you. You should take the things you bought to my house, mom, Terri is finally moving in about two hours, when I pick her up from her apartment. I'm going to see Travis with her tomorrow, I talked to her about that too."</p>
		<p>Natalie sighed with happy relief. "Oh, honey, she has been giving you the runaround for the past few weeks. Are you sure you didn't let your patience run out and rained all over her?" She asked.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled into the phone. "No, mom." She said in her low voice. "I was perfectly nice, I think. You need to ask <i>her</i>."</p>
		<p>Natalie laughed softly, and they said goodbye. The things would be in the house in half an hour.</p>
		<p>After working for another half-hour, hardly able to concentrate, she stood up and went by the window, looking down at the city. She thought that her solitude would be interrupted, and in a way she felt pleased about that. They still got along fairly, but she welcomed the new company. At times, Terri could be the most pleasant and agreeable individual, but at times she could be irritatingly closed and stubborn. They'd seen each other almost every other night during the past few weeks, Noemí trying to get her to stop the excuses and do what they had agreed she would do. Terri would say okay, and the next day, they would be in ground zero once again.</p>
		<p>Unwilling to work anymore, Noemí stood and walked over to get her jacket from the coat hanger and slipped it on. She stepped outside the office, and stood by her secretary's desk. She sat on the edge and smiled down at her. Her secretary, a pretty dark-haired Hispanic young woman, looked up from the computer with a welcoming smile. "How would you like to take the rest of the day off, Paula?" Noemí asked.</p>
		<p>Paula seemed actually surprised at the offer. She had two children, - a ten year old boy and an eight year old girl- she hardly has time to spend with, working so hard at the office. Her smile to Noemí was bright, and she said in an almost shy tone: "Yes, of course, I'd love to go home and spend time with my kids."</p>
		<p>Noemí stood up straight again, and smiled down at her. "Go ahead, I'm leaving now." She said, and walked away from the desk. The temperature outside felt more pleasant today; the past few days had been unbearably hot and humid. She walked next door to the parking lot, hands shoved into her trouser pockets, whistling softly.</p>
		<p>She drove with her top and the windows down; the much cooler air touches her skin in a sort of caress. Because of the early time in the afternoon, rush hour had not yet set in. There was only a short thirty-minute drive to Terri's apartment, and she arrived more than forty-five minutes earlier than she had said. She sat in her car for a long time, tapping the wheel to the music playing softly from her speakers. She looked up at the window, and decided to come in, in case Terri needed any help. As she reached out to push the door to building, it swung open and Terri stood there, two large boxes behind her.</p>
		<p>Noemí eyed the boxes, and then Terri, a scowl furrowing her brow. "You brought that down by <i>yourself</i>?" She asked in a bewildered tone, pointing at the boxes and looking at Terri as if she had gone crazy.</p>
		<p>Terri nodded and looked at Noemí as if nothing in the world was wrong. "Yes, why?" She said with a shrug.</p>
		<p>Noemí made an exasperated sound. "You're <i>pregnant</i>, Terri," She said almost shrilly. "That is why. I don't know how much you know, but it is dangerous for a pregnant woman to be lifting heavy things. You can cause yourself an abortion." She moved past her and reached for a box. It felt only slightly heavy to her, but to Terri's small frame it must surely have been a lead weight.</p>
		<p>"Is that true?" Terri whispered, grasping her shoulder and stopping her. Noemí could see that she scared her. She did not mean to. Terri's eyes held tears and her face paled. "I don't want to loose my baby, Noemí. Is that true?"</p>
		<p>Noemí propped the box against the doorframe and touched Terri's face softly with a finger. "Yes," She said in a low voice. "You just have to take care of yourself, that's all. You need to relax, you should have waited for me to do it."</p>
		<p>Terri nodded, and said: "But I saw you drive up, and I saw that you didn't get out of the car, so I thought that meant for me to bring the boxes down to the car myself." She said in a rush, visibly shaking.</p>
		<p>Noemí felt very stupid and she put the box down. She turned to Terri and took her face in her hands, looking into her eyes. "I was early, and I thought I'd give you a little more time before I went charging in." She said in a gentle voice. Then, to her surprise and Terri's, she bent and touched her smooth forehead with her lips. A feeling of tenderness shook her, and she pulled back, embarrassed. She turned and reached for the box again, hiding her blush. "Go get in the car, I'll be right there." She said.</p>
		<p>Terri said nothing and moved past her obediently, getting in the car and looking at her putting the boxes in the car. In less than two minutes, Noemí had both boxes in the back seat. She walked around the back of the car and slipped into the driver's seat. She turned and touched Terri's shoulder gently, and noticed the thin streak of tears on her pale cheeks. "Oh, Terri," She whispered tenderly, and touched her cheek with the backs of her fingers, wiping the tears slowly. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you. I can be very brutal sometimes."</p>
		<p>Terri shook her head and looked down at her lap. "No, you're right." She said. "It was stupid of me. It's just the thought of loosing my baby terrifies me." She closed her eyes momentarily, and then looked up at Noemí with a shaky smile on her lips. "You know I felt it move again?"</p>
		<p>Noemí was so pleased that she strokes her cheek again and squeezes her shoulder. "Great!" She said, and her smile grows. "Maybe you'll let me feel it move sometime." She continued, and turned on her seat to drive.</p>
		<p>She didn't see the blush covering Terri's cheeks as she drove off.</p>
		<p>"Oh God," Terri breathed to herself as her eyes take in all of the living room. "Its beautiful!" She walked deeper into the room, and looked at the furnishings, at the paintings and family pictures all over the place, at the glass coffee table of intricate design. Her fingers touched and stroked the materials, as if to tell herself that they were all real. She turned to Noemí as she walked in with the second box, her eyes shiny. "I'm going to live here?" She asked in a whisper, not believing it.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled as she put the box down right inside the door. She shrugged and nodded, the material of her shirt stretching across her strong shoulders. "Yes," She said blinking. "You don't like it?"</p>
		<p>Terri blinked. Like it? <i>Like it? This is wonderful, Ms. Leone. Maybe you take it for granted because you've always been rich. But </i>me<i>? I'm a bum from the streets, Ms. Leone, I've never been around such riches, and Anthony didn't even take me out in his beautiful BMW!</i> "I love it." She said in a low voice and continued to look around.</p>
		<p>"Help yourself to anything, Terri. Look around." Noemí said gently. When she saw that Terri didn't move, she walked by her and takes her arm, gently guiding her out of the living room and down one of the halls leading into other areas of the house. There were two doors to the left, and two to the right, there was another one facing them at the end of the hall. Noemí showed her into the first door. The room was large, larger than Terri was accustomed to. In that room stood a large desk cluttered with papers; a black IBM computer and a printer shared the messy space. Full of novels and such, against the wall stood a large bookcase, a copying and faxing machine on a medium sized table to the right. A large window behind the desk gave a beautiful view of the trees that cradle the large house around three sides. "My office, I work here, as you can see by the mess on my desk." Noemí explained with a dry chuckle, Terri couldn't help but be impressed.</p>
		<p>She guided her out of the office and into the hallway again. Opening the first door on the right, she showed her into her own bedroom. The room was a little larger than the first one; painted an off-white color, it looked almost cheerful. Terri noticed that it seemed hardly lived in, as if Noemí didn't ever sleep there. The large bed was neatly made, and it looked as if it hasn't been unmade for a long time. A long mahogany dresser to one side of the bed, shining beautifully with the sunlight, sat right below the pretty bay window. There were pictures in frames on top of it, and brushes and perfumes sat neatly above the surface, as if they hadn't been moved in ages. The closet, right beside the entrance, could be accessed easily if she turned to her right.</p>
		<p>"This is my bedroom," Noemí said softly, and swallowed hard, guiding Terri out of the room too quickly.</p>
		<p>"You hardly use your bedroom." Terri said softly.</p>
		<p>Noemí didn't answer and opened the second door on the left side of the hall. Inside, Noemí had a gym set. A treadmill, bike, a weightlifting set and other assorted exercise materials. A window to the back of the room, like in her office, lights the room with a beautiful glow, shining off the clean metal of the equipment. "My gym," Noemí said, sounding at ease again, and she continued with some levity: "Maybe after the baby is born, you'll want to do exercise." She chuckled as she guided her out of the room. She stopped at the door perpendicular to the gym's door, and opened it. Inside was the largest bathroom Terri had ever seen, she gasped and walked inside, eyeing everything. Noemí came in after her, and took a hold of her arm. "You can look at this later." She said gently, and guided her out and to the last of the doors, pausing and looking at Terri. "This is your room, we can buy a crib later on." She whispered and pushed the door open.</p>
		<p>"Oh wow." Terri breathed softly, taking in everything in the room as she walked in. The bed, nestled below the window, was completely made up with pink quilts and covers. The pillows were plump and brand new, as well as the mattress. The canopy frame, black in color, felt smoothly comforting as she stroked it with shaky fingers, standing on the right side. Looking around the room, she saw thin boxes propped up against the wall on the other side of the bed, a closed tripod leaned beside them also.</p>
		<p>A red box shone beside the boxes and Terri suspected she knew what it was. She walked tentatively around the bed and made her way to the box, heart beating fast. There were drawing notepads on top of the box, more than ten, for sure. Kneeling down, one leg braced beneath her, she removed the pads and placed them on the bed. She unclasped the top and opened it. Paints of all colors, brushes of all sizes, and a palette are inside the large sized box. She pulled out a brush, and stroked the wood handle slowly, then the beautiful soft brush.</p>
		<p>She didn't realize she was crying until a thick tear falls on her wrist, and she jumped as Noemí's hand touched her shoulder gently. She looked up at her. Noemí smiled down at her, and with her gold hair falling over her forehead, almost covering her eyes, she looked so endearing. Terri looked down at the box again, and she tried to control her tears. "This-" She began, but her voice broke. "This is wonderful." She looked at the thin boxes, and she instinctively knew that they were canvases. "This is too much." She shook her head and closed her eyes tightly.</p>
		<p>Noemí sat down on the floor, legs crossed, back resting against the bed. "Well, I think you deserve something from us, don't you?" Noemí said softly, looking down at the oil based colors stacked together inside the box, the brushes lying across the compartment above. She reached over and took one of the brushes and gently stroked the horsehair brush with her long fingers. She smiled at Terri. "You ever paint with oil paint?" She asked.</p>
		<p>"In high school," Terri replied her voice hoarse with suppressed emotion. "They had an art program for painters, and I learned to use them. I only used them in school, since they supplied us with them. When I left home, and ended up in New York, I couldn't afford anything." She stopped and stayed silent, looking down at the brush in her hand, her hair falling over her cheeks from her ever-present ponytail.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled softly, and brushed the hair from her cheeks. "Well, now you have all the time, and all the support in the world to paint what you want." She said and smiled.</p>
		<p>Terri lifted her eyes and looked at her for a long moment. "I want to paint <i>you</i>." She said with a small smile. She saw Noemí as such a mix of emotions and colors; Noemí intrigued her.</p>
		<p>Noemí's smile faded and pulled her hand away, clearing her throat. "Why would you want to paint me?" She asked uneasily, looking away.</p>
		<p>"Because," Terri said with a shrug, sitting down and resting her back on the bed like Noemí. "I find you intriguing. I'd like to see what's inside you, and painting you is the only way." If she took the time to associate Noemí with a color, it would be gray. Her emotions were gray, far from happy.</p>
		<p>Noemí shook her head and made a face, not a face of disgust or anger, but of dismissal. "No, I don't like being painted." She said and stood up, walking to the window. She stared out as if looking for something amongst the trees behind the house, shoving her hands into her trouser pockets. Suddenly, she turned to Terri and said: "You're hungry?" Terri nodded and put her brushes away, a little surprised at Noemí's reaction to her desire to paint her. "Good, I'll order something out. I barely eat here, and I can't cook."</p>
		<p>"I can cook." Terri said, and Noemí smiled as she shook her head.</p>
		<p>"Not tonight, you have to make yourself comfortable." She walked to the door, and lingered there for a few seconds, her hand on the knob as she stared at Terri. "I'll go order the food, then I'll take a shower, and then we can eat." She said in a soft tone, and left Terri to explore her new bedroom.</p>
		<p>Terri sank her fork into a thick piece of rib tip; her mouth watered as she lifted it to her mouth. Chewing, she closed her eyes and moaned with satisfaction. "This is delicious!" She said softly, and opened her eyes to find Noemí staring at her with a smile on her face. They sat at the kitchen table, a bag of Italian food to one side of the table. A big glass of apple juice sat in front of Terri's plate, and she reached for it to wash down the piece of rib. Noemí had turned on only one light in the kitchen, the one right above the table, which reflected a low yellowish light onto the table. Already dark outside, they sat in the house's comfortable silence, only the sound of Terri's eating being heard; the rest of the lights in the house were off. "I have honestly never tasted something this delicious, Noemí." She whispered, embarrassed and blushing. "I'm sorry, I think I'm extremely impressed."</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled and leaned forward. She propped her arms on the table, pushing the barely touched plate of Fettuccini Alfredo aside. She leaned her chin on a hand, and Terri could see the muscles of her arms work through her tight T-shirt. "It is understandable, if you've never experienced anything like this." She said, and played with her fork.</p>
		<p>Terri looked at her plate, and noticed that Noemí didn't touch her plate. "Why didn't you eat?" She asked, and looked at her closely.</p>
		<p>Noemí sat back and looked uncomfortable. "I ate enough today." She answered.</p>
		<p>For the first time, with the help of the shadows that the light had made Terri noticed the hollows under her eyes, the way her cheeks were slightly sunken in. Tall, no less than five feet eleven inches, with broad shoulders and well-defined muscles, Noemí was what her brother was not. She now wore a T-shirt and sweatpants. Her eyes were a strange blue in the dark lighting, yellowish in color. Terri suspected that Noemí didn't eat like she should, but she didn't dare point it out to her.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, Noemí stood up from her chair and brought her plate to the sink. "It's almost September," She said as she pushed the food into the electric disposal, her back turned to Terri. "Fall is coming soon, and you'll need some winter clothes. Mom is taking you shopping tomorrow after the doctor, you'll be going with René." She paused.</p>
		<p>"Will you be coming with us?" Terri asked, strangely wanting her company.</p>
		<p>Noemí shook her head and washed her plate. "No, I'll be seeing Victoria," She said, and placed the plate next to the sink. "I haven't seen her in quite a few days." She turned around to look at Terri, crossing her arms over her chest and smiling.</p>
		<p>"You love each other very much." Terri stated more than asked.</p>
		<p>A smile crossed Noemí's handsome features, and she stared off into space. "She's like my sister. She has been my support system all my life. Can't go without seeing her for a few days." She said in a low voice.</p>
		<p>Terri misconstrued her words, and looked at her in bewilderment. "You're telling me you didn't have a happy childhood? But with those parents-"</p>
		<p>Noemí shook her head and smiled. "That's not what I said." She corrects her. "We have always been there for each other. And she's kept me sane for the past few years." She bit her lower lip and seemed like she was in deep thought.</p>
		<p>"Why the past few years?" Terri asked, picking up from her words. "What has happened in the past few years that you need her so much?"</p>
		<p>Noemí seemed to loose her temper, and her smile faded as she stared at Terri. "Can't someone need her best friend without something having happened?" She snapped at her, and she ran a hand through her hair. "What is it with you?" She walked out of the kitchen, leaving Terri looking after her as if she were crazy, not knowing what she did wrong. She stood up to pick up the mess.</p>
		<p>When she finished in the kitchen, she walked down the hall and found Noemí sitting on the couch, bent forward, her elbows resting on her knees and a drink in her hand. An open bottle of Jack Daniels sat in front of her on the coffee table and she stared at it fixedly. A scowl pushed down her eyebrows and her hair fell forward onto her forehead in unruly locks. She took a long drink from her glass, grimacing and licking her lips slowly. Terri stood silently, watching her, waiting to see if Noemí would say anything to her. But she remained silent and Terri turned away to walk down the hall. "It's a long story, you know." Noemí whispered hoarsely, and Terri stopped in her tracks. "But I'll never tell you about it."</p>
		<p>Terri looked at the floor, still turned away from her. "I've never had a best friend, Noemí." She said softly, and she knew that in the silent house, Noemí could hear every word she was saying. "I'm sorry if I asked too many questions for your comfort." She continued, and walked down the hall, leaving Noemí alone in the living room.</p>
		<p>Late into the night, she could still feel and hear her walking around the house. To Terri, it was as if there was an unspent energy within her that didn't allow her to sit still, much less sleep. Her light footsteps passed in front of Terri's door and disappeared into the door directly in front of hers. The door closed softly behind her. The gym, Terri figured, and soon heard the muffled sound of the weights and Noemí's grunts of effort. She didn't understand the restlessness within Noemí, and put it out of her mind as she closed her eyes, shifted on her comfortable new bed, and fell asleep with the ease of pregnant women.</p>
		<p>Her arms were bulging, the veins showing, as she pushed the weights up away from her chest. The weights were set at 360 pounds, and she lifted them almost too easily. Three years of practice had left her strong. Since she began therapy three months after the accident, two months after waking up from a coma, she had exercised almost every night, when sleep eluded her. With each lift of the weight, she fought the memories threatening to fill her mind, to drive her to insanity.</p>
		<p>The light film of sweat all over her body comforted her, let her know that she was working hard, and kept her mind from her memories. The clenching of her toned muscles reminded her that she was alive, that she could feel pain. And with this knowledge, she continued for hours, moving from machine to machine.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Nine">
		<p>"Wait outside, Noemí, I'm going to check her out and I'll call you back in when we finish." Doctor Travis Martin said to Noemí. He gestured her in. "If you may come in, Ms. Bledsoe." She preceded him into the office, both leaving Noemí alone in the waiting room.</p>
		<p>A pleasant man well into his fifties, he still looked fit and handsome. He had been the Leone's doctor forever, since before Noemí was born. She had grown to love him like an uncle, and he had grown to love her like a niece. He had been there when she'd suffered the accident, making sure himself that she was being taken care of correctly. When they had found out that she would remain blind in her left eye, he fought and fought to find a way to fix it, letting his emotional attachment to the Leone children and parents to overlook his professional knowledge.</p>
		<p>He'd been the one who convinced her that she could still drive, though with a little more caution. He'd been with her when she'd first gotten behind the wheel of a car more than a year after the accident, grasping her shoulder comfortingly, though he was a little frightened when she finally thought she could drive normally again and swerved awkwardly. It took a lot of work, but she drove now as if nothing was wrong with one of her eyes.</p>
		<p>Noemí sat down on one of the waiting chairs and leaned her head back against the wall. Nursing a little hangover, she became aware of her body ache. She'd spent most of the night in her little gym, and had exhausted every muscle in her body. Her arms, shoulders, and thighs felt taut. Today, she wore khaki slacks, a white T-shirt and brown loafers. She felt comfortable and relished that rare occasion. She waited more than an hour, knowing very well how Travis Martin could be exaggeratedly thorough, specially with a first time patient. She was standing studying one of the numerous paintings in the room when Travis came out of his examining room. He closed the door quietly and Noemí didn't realize he was next to her until he cleared his throat.</p>
		<p>She turned to look at him and smiled. "So," She began. "How are she and the baby?"</p>
		<p>Travis looked at her for a long moment. "First of all," He said, wagging a stern finger at her. "Don't think I don't notice that you haven't been eating or sleeping, my dear patient; and that you haven't come in here for a checkup in a long time. Do you think, by any chance, that I am stupid? Don't try to act like there is nothing going on." He sounded very angry with her, and she stared at him for a long time before answering.</p>
		<p>"Travis," She said slowly, through clenched teeth. "This appointment is not about me, okay?" She pointed at the door to the examining room. "I brought her in here to talk about <i>her</i> health, not about mine, so lets not get sidetracked. Okay?"</p>
		<p>He moved closer to her and looked into her eyes. "You haven't been sleeping, why?" He asked in a quiet voice, ignoring the warning in her voice that he knew so well. "What is going on? Why don't you talk to me?"</p>
		<p>Noemí looked away from him and shoved her hands in her pockets. "There is nothing going on with me. What about her?" She said, again through clenched teeth. "That <i>is</i> what I'm here for, <i>remember</i>?"</p>
		<p>He knew he was getting to her, so he backpedaled, sighing. "We will talk later." He warned as he guided her towards the examining room.</p>
		<p>Terri sat on the examining table, fully clothed already, though her worn shoes lay on the floor. She looked at Noemí pleadingly. "I can't bend down to even put my shoes back on." She said, wondering how she'd done it this morning.</p>
		<p>Noemí eyed her stomach as she bent down to pick up one shoe and slipped it into her swelling foot, and saw hardly any difference in its size. Travis saw her look and explained: "As you know, darling, the fetus doesn't blow up until about the end of the second trimester. She's only in the beginning. Come sit on these chairs." They did so and he continued: "She's anemic," He saw the look of alarm in Noemí's eyes and soothed her. "There is nothing wrong if we take care of that; prenatal vitamins, regular checkups, that type of thing. I'm recommending her to take a Lamaze class."</p>
		<p>Noemí started. "La-what?" She asked, sitting forward on the seat.</p>
		<p>Travis smiled as he pulled his prescription pad and began to write a prescription for the vitamins Terri had to drink for the remaining months of pregnancy. "Lamaze," He repeated for Terri's benefit, he knew Noemí knew what Lamaze was. "It is basically a physical and psychological course for the mother to learn the art of being completely connected to the moment of childbirth without drugs. Usually, the fathers, or the other half of the couple learn with the mother, so that he or she can be there to help her when the moment gets tough. In the case of single mothers, usually a friend or family member joins that person in the birthing room, and they usually won't allow them in unless they have Lamaze training, a few exceptions included." He paused, then to their amazement, said: "I'd prefer if you, Noemí, since you will be sharing most of the time with Terri, take the Lamaze class with her."</p>
		<p>Noemí looked at him, thinking <i>He is crazy!</i> She shook her head and sat back, glancing at Terri, who looked at her dubiously. "We can hardly get along for more than two hours without fighting, Travis." She said as a means of explanation. Terri nodded her agreement.</p>
		<p>Travis gave the papers from the pad to Terri and laced his fingers patiently in front of his face, his elbows resting on the arm rests of his chair. "I understand that, Terri said a little something of that herself." He said with a suppressed smile. "But if I'm correct about Lamaze, it will also bring you to understand each other and connect better and communicate." Travis had an unconventional spiritual belief in the connecting of the minds. "I made the appointment yesterday. For Friday evening, to give you a better time after work, Noemí." He pointedly ignored the withering look she sent his way, smiling pleasantly at both of them.</p>
		<p>Terri stood in the outside room as Noemí remained inside with Travis. "Damn you, Travis," She hissed in a low voice after closing the door to the outer room. He remained calm, staring at her as she vented her frustration. "You know well that I can't go to one of those classes. It hurts me; Amelia and I had gone-" Her voice broke and she let her head hang, her chin pressed against her chest. She took a deep breath and fought the tears that threatened to spill from her eyes.</p>
		<p>His hand touched her shoulder, and she shrugged it away. He could infuriate her so much sometimes. "I know how you feel, Noemí," He said in a low voice, knowing Noemí's pain. "But you have to face the memories and the pain. You have to move on, you're stalling." He reached to touch her shoulder again, but she stepped back, her eyes hard.</p>
		<p>She hissed at him in anger, anger that he'd gotten very used to. "Fuck you!" And stormed out of the office, barking at Terri to come with her or find her own way back home. Terri followed her with one last glance at Dr. Martin; she liked him, and she couldn't for the life of her figure out why Noemí was so angry with him when she seemed to love him so much. He smiled at her in his pleasant way; a slight nod bid her goodbye.</p>
		<p>Outside, as they walked to the spot Noemí had found to park, Terri struggled to catch up to her. Her breath shortened, and already she felt tired. Noemí's long legs took her ahead of Terri by a few feet, and she didn't notice that Terri lagged behind. "Noemí," Terri panted, her swelling legs aching. "Please, slow down."</p>
		<p>Noemí at first acted as if she didn't hear the plea, but then her straight tense shoulders hunched and her legs slowed to allow her to catch up with her. When Terri caught up to her and walked next to her, she looked up at her face. Noemí's jaw clenched as she walked at a more sedate pace; her eyes narrowed and her lips were pulled in a tight angry line. "I like Doctor Martin, Noemí." She said, trying to appease her. "He talked to me a lot, more than those doctors at the clinic."</p>
		<p>"Good for you." Noemí said shortly, as if she hadn't the care in the world for what Terri had to say. She realized that Terri lagged behind once again, and she didn't care to turn to see if she was close to her. They reached the car; she unlocked and opened the door to the passenger side for Terri. But Terri remained a few feet away, staring at her with gray brown fury. "Are you getting in any time soon?" Noemí snapped at her, unable to curb her anger. "I have things to do."</p>
		<p>Terri's stare didn't waver. "What did I do to you?" She asked, and remained standing there in the middle of the sidewalk with her arms crossed.</p>
		<p>Noemí's patience and temper flared, she felt herself loosing control. "Nothing!" She said loudly, her eyes flashing fire, momentarily scaring Terri. "Nothing," She said again. "You did nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing!" She stalked to the other side of her car and tried to slip the key into the hole, but her hands were shaking and she failed. She cursed loudly and kicked at the door viciously. By this time, people were staring, and she glared at them hard, forcing them to look away.</p>
		<p>Terri's worry grew greater than her fear of Noemí, and she watched Noemí abuse the car she seemed to love so much. "Noemí," She whispered, and moved as if to walk around the car to her.</p>
		<p>"Leave me alone, Terri." Noemí said in a low warning voice, and to Terri it felt as if all the warmth between them had turned to ice.</p>
		<p>Terri's step faltered. "Noemí, I-"</p>
		<p>"Get away from me." Noemí whispered tightly as she leaned against the car, knowing she was being unfair, feeling tired herself from the anger having its course through her body. <i>What I need right now is a drink, not comfort</i>, she thought to herself, feeling suddenly thirsty for a nice glass of warm Brandy. She felt Terri's hand on her shoulder and pushed it away, anger surfacing anew.</p>
		<p>But Terri's own anger unleashed now, and she glowered at Noemí for a long moment. "I'll leave you alone." She said coldly, turning and walking away, her back rigid with her struggle for composure.</p>
		<p>Noemí walked after her and grabbed her by the arm, yanking her around and pulling her towards the car. Her voice low and cold, she said close to her ear: "Get in the car."</p>
		<p>Terri fought against her grip, the pain searing through her arm from Noemí's fingers around it tight. "Let me go, Noemí," She said in an equally cold voice. "You are a self absorbed bitch, and I want nothing more to do with you. It was a pleasure having shared your house for one night, but I'd like to go back to my studio." She said the words in a clipped voice.</p>
		<p>"Self absorbed!" Noemí exclaimed, stopping short and flinging her arm, causing her to stagger. "Me, self absorbed, who has helped you as best as I could, who has offered you the roof of my house. <i>I'm</i> self absorbed!" Her eyes flashed with fury not directed at her, but landing on her just the same.</p>
		<p>Terri spun around and started to walk away. She felt strong hands wrap around each of her arms and jerk her against a tall muscled body. She cried out, suddenly in fear for herself and her baby, forgetting that the only person who would take hold of her that way was Noemí. An image of her large father and brothers coming at her flashed behind her eyes and she closed them tightly as her feet were almost lifted off the ground and strong arms held her tight. "My baby, please don't hurt my baby!" She moaned, feeling and not feeling Noemí's face pressing against the back of her head, her body pressing against her back. She felt her own arms pressed against her sides by the strong arms. Tears filled her eyes and her body trembled.</p>
		<p>"I'm sorry," A husky voice murmured against her ear, and she recognized it as Noemí's through the fearful muddle in her mind. "Oh, God, Terri, I'm sorry! It's not you, you did nothing." She lifted her head and pressed it against the back of her head, her body shook against her.</p>
		<p>"I want to go home." Terri moaned softly, trying to free her arms from the tight grasp. "Please take me home, I can't take this." She became aware of being set back on her feet, and she turned willingly into Noemí's arms. She didn't feel the fist of anger there any more, only tenderness and apology. She felt Noemí's warm shuddery breath against her forehead and she wrapped her arms around her waist. "Why are you like this?" She asked, but Noemí didn't answer for a long time.</p>
		<p>Then she said with a heaving sigh: "You wouldn't understand, Terri," A deep tremble shook her body anew. "You would never understand."</p>
		<p>Victoria smiled when she opened the door to find Noemí standing there, but her smile faded when she saw the pallor on her best friend's skin. She pulled her into the apartment and closed the door after her. "What's going on?" She asked, pushing her towards the living room. "How is Terri? There's nothing wrong, is there?"</p>
		<p>Noemí remained quiet for a long time; she flopped down on the couch with a heavy thud. "Nothing's wrong with Terri, she's perfectly fine." She said in a whisper. "We had a little falling out."</p>
		<p>"Why?" Victoria asked, sitting down beside her.</p>
		<p>Noemí sighed and sat rigidly, anger seeming to rake through her again. "Travis, that son of a bitch, he-"</p>
		<p>"Your doctor?" Victoria asked in shock.</p>
		<p>"Yes, him," Noemí said with enough venom in her voice to kill a million people. "He suggested I go to Lamaze classes with Terri, as if he forgot that he sent me to Lamaze with Amelia."</p>
		<p>Victoria could see the method he was trying to use on Noemí. Face your memories, he'd probably said to Noemí, and Noemí had lashed out on him with her always-repressed anger. "So he did." She breathed thoughtfully, index and thumb hugging her chin. "Well, Terri needs the help, don't you think?"</p>
		<p>"Fuck what Terri needs." Noemí burst in a moment of childish rebellion, and she regretted it, because she knew that Terri wouldn't be in the current situation if it weren't for her irresponsible brother. "No, forget I said that," She waved her long fingers. "I don't know what to say. All I know is I scared the shit out of her, and she probably thought I'd hurt her like her father and brothers did."</p>
		<p>Victoria was thinking quietly. <i>Two volatile tempers in one house, oh boy!</i> "Did you apologize?" She asked in a quiet voice, knowing that wasn't always the answer. Noemí nodded and closed her eyes. "Where is she now?"</p>
		<p>"She's with mom and René, shopping baby stuff and clothes for her." Noemí replied with sigh. She leaned back against the couch, then suddenly stood up. She went to Victoria's liquor cabinet in the kitchen.</p>
		<p>As she reached in to pick out the Brandy, she felt Victoria's hand on her shoulder pulling her back. "Oh, no," Victoria said firmly. "You're not drinking now. We're going to talk, both of us nice and sober." Noemí pushed her hand away and moved back to take the bottle. Victoria, as tall as she was but not as strong, knew that Noemí could overpower easily. Still, she was willing to wrestle her to the ground if she so much as tried to have that drink. Her hand went back to her shoulder.</p>
		<p>"Stop it!" Noemí snapped at her, spinning around and shoving her away. "Don't touch me." She said in a softer tone, almost a plead, and she turned around to the cabinet again.</p>
		<p>"Noemí," Victoria said, surprised by Noemí's sudden reaction. Before she knew it, Noemí pushed her against the hallway wall, her hands grasping the front of her shirt and lifting her off her feet. Noemí brought her face close to hers and her eyes were almost unrecognizable, her anger getting the best of her; her breath quickened as she came closer to loosing total control.</p>
		<p>"Get the fuck out of here, Noemí!" Victoria hissed, her momentary fear waning in her bewilderment. "Let me go and get the fuck out of here."</p>
		<p>Noemí's eyes seemed to change as she realized what she had done. Suddenly, she let Victoria go, and before Victoria could say a word, she was through the front door and running down the driveway and continuing on down the street. <i>Shit!</i> Victoria thought to herself as she looked and reached for her keys, ran after her. Outside, she looked up and down the street frantically; there was no sight of Noemí anywhere. She ran down the block towards Metropolitan Avenue, two blocks away. An Irish bar she and Noemí had frequented since they came of age was quiet in the early afternoon, and she hoped that she would find Noemí there.</p>
		<p>Inside, a pleasant coolness and chatter replaced the warmth. Suddenly dark to her eyes, she allowed her eyes to adjust to the dim interior; looking carefully at everybody, she couldn't find Noemí there. She ran back outside, and jumped at the sound of a blaring horn. She walked down the block to go back to her apartment. She heard the blasting horn again, and turned towards its source. She recognized Michaela's car and watched as she double-parked. She leaned far in the passenger window, and kissed Michaela softly, feeling happy that she came. Michaela pulled back and looked into her eyes, sensing her distracted worry. "What's going on? Why are you running around Metropolitan Avenue?" She asked.</p>
		<p>Victoria braced herself against the roof of the car, lifting her legs and bringing them through the open window. Settling herself on the passenger seat, she sighed and brought up the passenger side window. "I'm trying to find Noemí. She's going through something right now." She replied as Michaela drove off down the street.</p>
		<p>"What's wrong with her?" Michaela, concerned, threw a side-glance at Victoria.</p>
		<p>"Well, she has memories, Michaela." Victoria said softly and shook her head. "You have to be careful about the way you say certain things to her. She remembers the accident as if it were happening to her at that same moment, and she runs away from it, turning to alcohol and anger. Today, when she went with Terri to the doctor, he suggested Noemí go to Lamaze classes with her." She kneaded the bridge of her nose with her fingers. "When Amelia was alive, they were going to the Lamaze classes. They never finished them." She heard Michaela's soft gasp of sympathy, and reached over to take her hand in hers.</p>
		<p>Michaela returned the gentle touch. "So, where to?" She asked softly.</p>
		<p>Victoria made a sound of frustration. "I don't know." She said in a soft tone. "I don't want to worry her father, but maybe I should call him. He trusts me to call him whenever something like this happens. We've been dealing with these moments for years, but we're still not used to it. We're afraid that Noemí might kill herself one day, drinking like she does and then driving." Tears stung her eyes, and she tried to fight them, winning out after a long time. She rubbed a hand over her mouth and thought hard. "Okay, she may be at Friday's; she's always liked that restaurant. I know she started going again, when she took Terri there to eat. We have a friend who works there, an old fling-"</p>
		<p>"Of yours or of Noemí's?" Michaela couldn't help but asking.</p>
		<p>Victoria looked at her for a long moment, and then said: "An old fling of <i>Noemí's</i>, before Amelia came along. This woman is still carrying a torch for her; she had been going after her since high school, until Noemí finally gave in. They became good friends after it ended between them, but I know they hadn't seen each other in a while."</p>
		<p>Michaela nodded, and made a U-turn when it became possible, driving back towards Lefferts Boulevard.</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Ten">
		<p>Noemí, bent over her fourth drink, already felt lightheaded. Melanie, sitting across from her on the other side of the table, stared at her with concerned eyes. "Noemí, tell me what's wrong, please." She pleaded with her for what seemed like the fiftieth time, trying to keep her own tears from her eyes. Noemí simply stared at the glass in her hand. Melanie had been pleading off and on with her for the past hour, fortunate because there hadn't been that many customers coming into the restaurant. She looked up as her three o'clock relief came in, and she whispered to Noemí: "Come home with me, Noemí." She sighed as Noemí nodded slowly, her eyes lifting from the glass to Melanie's.</p>
		<p>Melanie smiled at her and stood up, going over to her relief; she talked in whispers with him. "Thanks." She said louder, and returned to Noemí's side. Noemí fumbled through her bills and threw money onto the table. "Come on, we can walk to my place from here." She slipped under her arm and brought it over her shoulders.</p>
		<p>Noemí staggered as she walked with her, her balance precarious as her eyes almost closed. "I should be helping you, Melanie," She slurred close to her ear, her warm breath stroking her ear and making her shiver. "Look how small you are, you can't possibly hold me up should I fall."</p>
		<p>Melanie couldn't help but laugh, and she poked her gently with an elbow. "Good things come in small packages," She said, and Noemí laughed against her, tightening her arm and sloppily kissing her temple.</p>
		<p>"I hope strength is one of those good things," Noemí bantered drunkenly, her lips pressed against her temple and unnerving her more than her closeness did.</p>
		<p>Melanie laughed, fighting with feelings of desire and many other things she rather not mention. She had known Noemí since freshman year in high school, and had been in love with her since. She had tried and tried and tried over and over again to get her to go out at least once. Finally, Noemí conceded, and made it her business to get to know Melanie. What she found out, she liked, and they soon began to go out. They had wandered away from each other after high school and more during college, each meeting new people and new lovers. Melanie had never stopped feeling deeply for Noemí, and she made sure they saw each other often, occasionally sharing a bed.</p>
		<p>It all stopped when Noemí met Amelia and fell in love. She had no eyes for anyone else, but Melanie remained her good friend. When Amelia died in that horrible accident and Melanie found out that Noemí had survived, she had felt guilty when she thought that she and Noemí could be together again. So she never sought her out, and stayed back, hearing through Victoria and then mutual friends that she was physically recovering, but that emotionally she wasn't the same any more.</p>
		<p>At her apartment, she guided Noemí to the couch.</p>
		<p>She was born of wealthy parents, and had a nice trust fund that kept her comfortable. She wanted to work outside her parents' company, but her parents would have none of it. They had indulged her when she wanted to go to college for a business degree, but had balked when she said she wanted to work outside the company, that she didn't want to follow her father's footsteps. So they had set up a trust fund, and she was now comfortable on her own. She had been working in the business district of Wall Street for a while, but the work became stressful and she quit. She then decided to work at her favorite hangout place for a while, just to take it easy from the pressures of the world.</p>
		<p>Sprawled on the couch, Noemí stared at her through glassy eyes, and Melanie stared back at her, wondering what she was thinking in her drunken stupor. She sat next to her slowly, and smiled when Noemí reached up and touched her cheek with her soft fingers. She turned her face to press her lips against the fingers touching her gently. "God, I've missed you, Noemí!" She breathed and leaned forward to kiss her lips softly. She felt Noemí respond to her, her smooth lips pressing against her own and opening to allow her tongue passage.</p>
		<p>Melanie's shaking hand moved to caress her flat stomach, moving beneath the shirt to caress the smooth skin there. She felt the muscles tighten against her palm, and a soft quiver shook her from deep within. Shifting her body, she sat astride Noemí, leaning down and meeting her lips again. Noemí's hands had a life of their own, and she caressed thighs and waist, she kneaded hips with her hands as Melanie shifted her hips down against hers. Melanie shuddered, the continuous light touch of Noemí's pelvis between her legs against the seam of her jeans aroused her anew, and she felt her wetness begin to grow. Her hand grasped Noemí's shoulders and she moved her hips to the rhythm of Noemí's hips.</p>
		<p>Noemí stopped, and sat up, pulling off her T-shirt and throwing it somewhere on the floor. She didn't bother to try to unbutton Melanie's shirt; she ripped it carelessly and yanked it off her shoulders, aware of the sudden catch in Melanie's throat. She buried her face between Melanie's ample breasts, and the familiar smell of the softly scented skin there aroused her more. She felt the alcohol in her system, but it was a secondary feeling compared to the reality of a live body pressed against her. She hadn't been with anyone since Amelia, only in her memories of Amelia, and she wondered why as she pushed them off the couch onto the floor.</p>
		<p>Their sex grew volatile, fast and hard. When Noemí's face moved between Melanie's legs, she remembered again what the feel of a woman blossoming against her tongue felt like, and the taste of a woman's sweet nectar rushing into her mouth as orgasm rocked her. Her arms around Melanie's waist were a vise-like grip that kept her mouth connected to her, her tongue anchored deep inside her. The feel of Melanie's thighs tensing violently against her shoulders rocked her body with an almost orgasmic rush; her screams were like a song in her ears.</p>
		<p>Before they knew it, hours had passed. They were sweaty by the time they stopped. Spent, not drunk anymore, she allowed Melanie to hold her, pressing her face against the hollow of her neck. Her arms were wrapped around her waist as Melanie's were around her neck, cradling her head close. Their bodies were pressed together tightly and Noemí found some comfort in that. Melanie kissed the top of her head and she whispered: "Stay the night, please."</p>
		<p>Noemí nodded slowly, and she lifted her head to kiss her. They started all over again, still fast, hard, sensuous.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Victoria stood in front of Friday's, fists against her hips. She had just been inside, and she had asked for Melanie. They told her that she had already left, alone. Victoria had been hoping that Noemí had at least left with her, but she had no way of knowing she did just that. By now, extremely nervous and frustrated, she felt tears burn her eyes. "Shit!" She muttered. She closed her eyes tightly, grateful for the feel of Michaela's arms sliding around her neck and pulling her close. "Michaela," She whispered hoarsely. "I've never let her get lost like that, I've never let her out of my sight when she's in that state of mind."</p>
		<p>"Its okay, honey, its okay." Michaela said, pulling back and wiping the tears gently from her cheeks. "You never expected her to go at you, either, my love. You were shocked."</p>
		<p>Victoria gasped as more tears stained her tanned cheeks, her hair in disarray from her fingers rushing through the silky strands over and over. "Oh, man," She said brokenly, and pulled back, pulling Michaela down the block. "We have to go to her parents' house, maybe she went there."</p>
		<p>Michaela allowed herself to be pulled and in minutes, they were walking up the driveway to the Leone's door. Thomas opened the door on the second ring. He seemed to be alone in the house, wearing silk pajama pants and a white BVD shirt. His face pinched with worry at Victoria's expression, he invited them in. Michaela introduced herself to him and he did the same, noticing the anxious worry torturing Victoria. "Victoria, dear, what is going on? Are you okay?" He asked of her, touching her shoulder.</p>
		<p>She paced back and forth in the living room, and then looked at him. "I don't know where Noemí is, Tommy. Do you?" She said suddenly.</p>
		<p>Surprised, he looked at her for a long moment before realizing what she said with her eyes. His daughter was going through another crisis. He crossed his arms over his chest, and turned away from them. "When was the last time you saw her?" He asked quietly, trying to remain calm, knowing fully well how his daughter's crisis could be.</p>
		<p>"In my place," Victoria answered him, sitting down on the couch and raking fingers through her hair once again. She brought a fist to her mouth and pounded softly against her lips, regretting having talked to Noemí in that way, no matter how surprised or angry her attack had made her. "She came to see me after dropping Terri off with Natty and René, and she was in a state. She wanted to drink, and I didn't let her. It seems Travis said a little something to her that bothered her."</p>
		<p>Thomas took a deep breath; he knew that Travis could be insensitive with his words sometimes. Almost every single time Noemí had gone to see him, she ended up upset, and Thomas knew it was because Martin tried to get her to do things that reminded her of Amelia. A plausible attempt and Thomas knew that it would someday bring his daughter back to the way she was, when she could remember Amelia without a nervous breakdown. Thomas had also known that she had been working too hard, and that she was pushing herself. "She's so sensitive, Michaela," Thomas said suddenly, turning to the pretty stranger that accompanied Victoria.</p>
		<p>Michaela smiles at him and says gently, in a strangely comforting voice: "I haven't met her yet, but I hope to soon."</p>
		<p>Thomas smiled at her; he liked her instinctively, and hoped Victoria decided to hang on to this one. He sighed and sat down beside Victoria, wrapping an arm around her shoulder. "Honey, all we can do is actually wait. Natalie should be home soon," He reassured her, though inside he trembled as hard as she outside. "We should call Noemí's house, maybe Terri will pick up." He moved to the cordless phone beside the couch and dialed.</p>
		<p>Terri picked up on the third ring; she sounded worried. "Hi, Mr. Leone, how are you?" She greeted him, sounding disappointed; she had been hoping it was Noemí calling. He returned her greeting, and she asked him before he had a chance to ask her: "Have you seen Noemí?"</p>
		<p>"No, honey, I was going to ask you the same." Thomas said, and his voice faltered. "She has not been home then?"</p>
		<p>"No," Terri replied, and she let out a long breath. "When she left me with Mrs. Leone, she wasn't in the best shape. She had a little altercation with the doctor. Mr. Leone," She said, sounding embarrassed. "What is going on? Why is she like this? Is it because I'm in her house?"</p>
		<p>"No, no, no," Thomas said with a laugh. "It hardly has anything to do with you, honey. This is something that has been happening with her for a long time. Maybe some day we can sit and talk about it. Can you call us if you hear anything from her, or if she comes home?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, you do the same." Terri said, and hung up.</p>
		<p>Victoria looked at him with red-rimmed eyes, shaking her head. "She has never gotten away from me like that." She said in a low voice, and then she stood. "We're going to her house, to wait for her there, if you hear anything, please, please, don't forget to call us, I'm worried sick."</p>
		<p>Thomas nodded and accompanied them to the door. Natalie and René arrived right as Victoria left with Michaela, climbing in Michaela's car and driving away quickly. They looked at Thomas curiously and Natalie asked, bringing bags out of the trunk: "What is going on, Thomas?"</p>
		<p>"Come inside, woman, and I'll explain." He said and walked into the house.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Eleven">
		<p>Terri jumped, frightened, when the bell rang. She stood up from her perch on the couch and looked at the door as if it were an enemy. She couldn't imagine who could be visiting this late. Noemí would have her own key. "Who is it?" She called out tentatively.</p>
		<p>"Victoria," Came the muffled answer.</p>
		<p>She recognized Victoria's voice and sighed with relief. She opened the door, and allowed her in, followed by another woman. The woman stared at her as she walked in behind Victoria, seemingly assessing her. "Terri, this is Michaela. Michaela, this is Terri." Victoria introduced distractedly. Terri nodded at her, not knowing if she would even shake her hand, she looked so snobbish. "Terri," Victoria said, not noticing the long look Michaela gave Terri in her worry. "You haven't heard anything?"</p>
		<p>Terri shook her head, and moved away from Michaela, for some reason feeling uncomfortable around her. "Can you tell me what is going on, Victoria?" She asked quietly, and gestured them to sit down. "Can you tell me why Noemí is so violent?"</p>
		<p>Victoria nodded and looked towards the kitchen. "Why don't we go into the kitchen, drink something fresh?" She suggested, preparing her mind to tell the story. Terri followed her into the kitchen, and they sat at the table, a glass of cold orange juice in front of each woman. Victoria sighed and began to tell Terri about Noemí and Amelia and the baby, the accident, and lastly the death of Amelia and the baby. "Next week is the anniversary of her Amelia's death" She trailed off.</p>
		<p>By the time she finished, Terri fought tears of sympathy, her lips trembling, and she looked away. She couldn't imagine what Noemí must feel every time she remembered her pregnant lover, especially since she loved her so much. "How far along was she, Victoria?" She choked out, lifting the cup to her lips and forcing down a mouthful of juice.</p>
		<p>Victoria looked at the glass clutched in her hand and answered in a choked whisper: "Seven months."</p>
		<p>Michaela reached over and stroked the hand clenched into a fist with gentle nails.</p>
		<p>Terri's eyes filled with tears, and she couldn't hold them back when they came. The more she knew about Noemí's pain, the more she cared about her, and the more she worried. "It was almost a reality." She whispered, and stood up suddenly. She left the kitchen, leaving Michaela and Victoria to look after her.</p>
		<p>They stood and followed her after a couple of minutes, curious and apprehensive. They didn't find her in the living room and Victoria guided Michaela down the long hallway to Terri's bedroom. Terri, sitting at the head of her bed, legs crossed, had a pad on her lap, a pencil in her thin fingers. Sketching quickly, her hand moved gracefully over the paper, the lead making a slight scratching sound in the silence. "What-" Michaela began, but Victoria gestured her to be quiet. She watched as Victoria walked away from her and around the bed towards Terri. She looked over her shoulder cautiously, and gasped at what she saw.</p>
		<p>Terri stopped, and looked up at her. "It comforts me, to draw and paint." She said in a whisper. "Knowing what has happened to Noemí makes me very sad. And I always painted when I was sad," She smiled ruefully and Victoria returned her smile with a squeeze of her shoulder. Terri continued: "Which explains all the paintings in my old place." She pointed at all the unopened canvases and box of paints. "Noemí had her mother buy me all of this, and I don't even know where to start. She's a very good person."</p>
		<p>Victoria smiled. "Noemí's got the heart of an angel." She said, and sat beside her on the bed. She gestured to Michaela, and she sat on the other corner of the bed. "When she loves, she loves for real. She won't say I love you unless she really feels it." She smiled at Michaela. "Can she see it?" She asked Terri.</p>
		<p>Terri blushed, and passed the notepad over to Michaela.</p>
		<p>Michaela smiled as she saw what she had drawn in a matter of seconds. She'd seen a picture of Noemí in Victoria's apartment, and recognized her. Terri's talent went beyond words; her definition of Noemí was perfect. "This is wonderful. How can you remember every single detail of her features?" She asked in wonder, seeing the same deep sadness she'd seen in the photographs.</p>
		<p>Terri looked down at the bed. "I've studied her," She answered in a low voice. "She is a very beautiful sight." Victoria agreed with a sound, and Michaela had to agree with her. "I've never painted a person before, and when I told her I wanted to paint her, to see what was inside her, she almost had an attack of the nerves. Now I know why, she doesn't want me to see the pain deep within her. But I saw it anyway, the first time I met her."</p>
		<p>Victoria rested her chin against her shoulder, smiling at Michaela, seeing her self-controlled attitude, however temporarily, baffled pleased her. Michaela's eyes were still on the drawing, and when she handed it back to Terri, a grudging respect had replaced the caution in her eyes. "It is wonderful," She said. "If you decide to make that painting, don't forget to let me see it."</p>
		<p>Terri nodded, and closed the notepad. "I worry about where she is at this time of the night." She said softly, throwing the pad towards the foot of the bed. She felt comfortable with Victoria's bulk next to her, and now with Michaela.</p>
		<p>"She needs a rest; she doesn't take a break from that dreadful office." Victoria said. "Ever since she was able to go back to work, she has been in that office all day, and half the night if I don't get her out of there." She hugged her to herself and kissed her cheek. "We're going, now, you need all your rest, my pregnant friend." She chuckled softly and stood up from the bed. She looked at Terri for a long time, a smile on her face. "Wait until Noemí starts letting you close, you'll see how good she can be. You won't even think about her bad moments, only when they happen. You'll see."</p>
		<p>Terri smiled back and nodded. "I've seen her good side already, Victoria, and I know that she doesn't mean what she says when she's angry. People just have to know what boundaries to cross with her." She said. "I'm learning them as we go." She paused and looked down at the bed. "Don't worry, I'll call you as soon as she gets home."</p>
		<p>"Thanks." Victoria said, and Terri guided her and Michaela to the door. Victoria leaned down to hug Terri and Michaela shook her hand with a genuine smile.</p>
		<p>Terri went to bed and stayed awake for most of the night, drawing in her pad and thinking.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>Noemí opened her eyes slowly, lifting her head. She had a slight headache, and her eyes felt a little gritty. The bed she slept in felt unfamiliar, though she recognized the redheaded nude woman sleeping languidly on her stomach beside her. Noemí looked away, remembering the long hours spent with Melanie, the passion with which they had shared their bodies. Careful not to wake Melanie, Noemí sat up and brought her legs over the side, standing up.</p>
		<p>Glancing at Melanie's bedside clock, she saw that it was close to three in the morning now. She padded towards the bathroom, wondering how long she slept for; she knew she didn't feel rested or at ease. "I need a drink." She whispered huskily to her hollow-eyed reflection in the mirror. With her hands grasping the sides of the sink, she leaned forward, closing her eyes. She thought of Melanie.</p>
		<p>She and Melanie had been lovers during their years in the same private High School, and through their first year of college. They'd parted slowly, seeing each other occasionally, then not at all. Noemí had begun to see other women halfway through that first year, so she didn't really mind their breakup. They would always be friends, even if they didn't see each other or do friendly things. She never expected to run into Melanie again, or for this to happen.</p>
		<p>"What's wrong, baby?" Melanie's gentle voice snapped her out of her thoughts and she opened her eyes. Their eyes met through their reflections in the mirror.</p>
		<p>Noemí didn't reply right away, and Melanie waited, her sad expression showing her knowledge of what Noemí's next words would be.</p>
		<p>"We can't do this again." Noemí said, her voice husky and raw.</p>
		<p>Melanie looked away, her eyes filled with pain. She leaned heavily against the doorframe. "Why?" She asked, her voice shaking slightly.</p>
		<p>Noemí looked down at her hands. "I can't love you." She said, her voice full of regret.</p>
		<p>Melanie nodded, biting her lower lip and trying not to cry. "I should have never brought you here." She whispered, her eyes watering.</p>
		<p>Noemí took that as her cue to leave, and she turned from the sink and walked past Melanie, gathering her clothes and slipping them on. Done, she turned to look at Melanie, who now watched her. "I'm sorry." She said, not knowing how to fix things.</p>
		<p>Melanie pointed towards the door and whispered: "Just go." She then began to cry, spun into the bathroom, slamming the door between them.</p>
		<p>Noemí held back tears, guilt tearing her inside. She left quietly and made her way out of the building. She knew she left her car in the parking garage near Friday's and she walked slowly in the direction of the restaurant. She paused in front of Friday's, glancing across the street at the bar and thinking about how thirsty she felt. She crossed the street and walked into the bar. Still in full swing, the bar's music pounded through her. The music played and people were either chatting away at the tables or at the bar, drinking. She saw an empty stool at the bar and moved towards it. Sitting down, she motioned to the bartender. "Whiskey, double." She said, and he smiled as he served her drink. She thanked him and told him to keep them coming.</p>
		<p>She stayed for a couple of hours and drank until the early hours of the morning, when the sunrise already had passed. She stumbled out of the bar across the street to the parking lot and eventually made it to her car.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>She wondered how she made it home, really. She knew she shouldn't have been driving in her state, but she didn't really care. She swerved into her drive. Stumbling out of her car and slamming the door closed, she staggered towards the front door. She got it open after some fumbling and cursing, and made a beeline for her liquor cabinet.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>When Terri finally allowed sleep to overtake her, the sun already lit the sky. She didn't sleep more than two hours before she heard the sound of keys clinking against the front door's knob, half-asleep. A thudding sound made her jump and the front door slammed shut, and then she heard a low curse. She recognized the voice, and got up from her bed. "Noemí." She called out, and heard the sound of glass clashing on glass.</p>
		<p>"Go back to bed, Terri." Noemí's hoarse voice called back, her words slurred a little. Terri didn't listen, and walked into the living room. Noemí stood in the center of the living room, a glass full of Brandy in her hand; her hair a tousled mess, her clothes wrinkled. Terri could see on her neck dark marks and knew they were hickeys. Her eyes had that haunted look from yesterday as they stared at her, unfocused. "I said go back to bed, Terri." She whispered softly, and drank from her glass.</p>
		<p>"Where have you been?" Terri asked her.</p>
		<p>Noemí made a face and turned away from her. "None of your concern." She responded in a harsh quiet voice.</p>
		<p>Terri remained calm, knowing Noemí's state of mind, her drunkenness. She said as calmly as she could: "Your family has been concerned, your best friend too. Everybody has been going crazy wondering where and how you were-"</p>
		<p>"Mind your fucking business, Terri." Noemí said coldly, swaying on her feet.</p>
		<p>"Noemí," Terri said pleadingly, moving closer to her. "You've been good to me, and I care about you. You have to talk-"</p>
		<p>"Shut up, shut up!" Noemí roared and spun around, hurled the glass, sending it flying across the room at Terri. It landed with a shatter on the wall next to her head.</p>
		<p>Terri's eyes closed in fright; Terri felt the warm liquid prickle her arm and her neck, heard the shattering sound like a bomb in her ears. Her eyes wide with fear, she spun and ran down the hall and into her room, ignoring Noemí's pleading voice, slamming the door closed. She leaned against the door, eyes wide, her body shaking. Her breaths came in short gasps. She cried out feebly when Noemí pounded on her door, hugging herself and trembling. She could hear her say something, but fear didn't allow her understand.</p>
		<p>"Please, Terri, open the door." Noemí pleaded, pounding on the door. "Are you hurt? Please, Terri!"</p>
		<p>Terri felt the baby inside her shift nervously, and she gasped when tears ran down her cheeks. The baby kicked again, and she hugged her stomach, trying to calm down for her baby's sake. Again, Noemí pounded on the door, and she felt the vibration against her back. "Terri, oh God, are you okay?" Noemí yelled out frantically, tears in her voice, the words becoming clear to Terri's ears. "Please, I didn't mean to hurt you!" She sobbed loudly and Terri could hear her body sliding downwards and heavily against the door. Her voice sounded closer to Terri's ear in her pleading. "Oh God, help me, please! I didn't want to hurt her! Oh God!" She banged on the door again.</p>
		<p>Terri moved away from the door and reached for the knob. She opened the door, and Noemí fell into the room, looking up at her through glazed, tearful eyes. "Oh, thank God!" She gasped, and her head fell onto the carpet. She pulled her knees up, hugging her legs to her chest, burying her face into her knees. Her body heaved and trembled violently as she cried. Crawling close to her side, Terri tentatively touched her shoulder. Instinctively, Noemí unwound her body and crawled onto her, wrapping her arms around her waist and pressing her face to her stomach. The baby shifted again, and Noemí felt it against her face. "I'm sorry, Terri, I'm so sorry. I don't know what's come over me." She whispered against her stomach. Somewhere in the house, Terri heard the phone ring. Neither woman moved to answer it and it continued to ring.</p>
		<p>Terri looked down at her and a sudden rush of tenderness surprised her. She smoothed her hair away from her forehead, and smiled softly, the fear suddenly gone. "I know what's come over you." She whispered, and Noemí turned her face to look at her with her one good eye, the other pressed closed against her stomach. "You have to talk about it, you know, or you'll be like this for the rest of your life." She said.</p>
		<p>Noemí turned her face into her stomach again, and said, sounding suddenly sober: "I didn't want to hurt you, I don't know what's come over me." Her arms around Terri's waist tightened and then suddenly loosened. She took a deep breath and she registered Terri's scent; like sweet strawberries in summer. "Are you hurt?" She asked suddenly, sitting up and touching her cheek and gazing at her, her eyes red-rimmed. "Please, tell me the truth. Are you hurt?" She seemed frantic for reassurance.</p>
		<p>Terri shook her head and smiled, taking her hand in hers and pulling it away from her face. "I'm fine, I'm telling you the truth." She whispered, and then paused, considering. "Well, my feelings are a little hurt. But I don't lie, never have." She reassured her. "We were all worried about you."</p>
		<p>Noemí sighed, and held Terri's hand in hers. "I stayed at a friend's house, I should have called, but I-" She stopped, her cheeks flushing redder.</p>
		<p>Terri's eyes wandered briefly to the marks on her neck. "I know what you were doing, you don't have to tell me." She smiled very softly, and Noemí returned her smile. "Just don't disappear like that, please. Not again." She whispered, her smile fading. "If you feel out of control, just talk to me. I know we've just met, but you've been the one who's helped me with this, with telling your parents. I feel closer to you. You've trusted me by bringing me to your house and giving me more things in two days than what I've had my whole life before this. Why can't you trust me enough to talk to me?"</p>
		<p>Noemí blushed, and moved closer to her, pulling her into an embrace and pressing her face against her shoulder. She felt Terri respond to her embrace. "You know why I'm like this?" She asked softly.</p>
		<p>Terri nodded, burying her face into her hair, breathing softly, rewarded with the musk scent of Noemí's skin. She said: "Yes, Victoria was here last night, worried sick about you. She brought her friend Michaela with her." She pulled back, and saw the shame in Noemí's eyes. "You've been rude to everybody." She admonished firmly, touching her cheek softly with her hand. Pulling back, she stood and offered her hands to Noemí.</p>
		<p>"Now," She said as Noemí stood up without her help. She pulled her towards the bed, and gestured to a beautiful wooden crib already set up close beside the bed. "Look at what your mother bought me. Isn't it beautiful?" Her smile showed emotion that she was obviously surprised she was feeling. Noemí couldn't help the instant tenderness she felt for Terri. There were bags beside the bed, close to twelve bags full of clothes and other assorted materials. Terri gestured to them and said: "She's gotten me all these maternity clothing. She also got my baby a lot of clothes, no definitive colors, because we don't know if it's a girl or a boy. She says that when I give birth she'll buy me more clothes." She looked up at Noemí with question in her eyes. "Don't you think this is too much?"</p>
		<p>Noemí shook her head and sat on the bed. "No," She said, eyeing the crib and the bags. "Let her indulge herself, she's always wanted a grandchild, and she's getting her wish, in however an unconventional way." She looked at the crib sadly, and her eyes filled with tears; she sat on the bed slowly. "You know," She croaked after a long moment, fighting against the tears. "Amelia and I didn't even get to buy a crib for the baby."</p>
		<p>Terri moved to her and wrapped her arms around her, holding her close; Noemí bent down and pressed her face against her swelling stomach again, her hands against her lower back pulling her close. "I'm so sorry, Noemí," Terri whispered, running her fingers through her hair. Noemí's shoulders shook as she cried. "I told you that you can talk to me about it, don't keep it all inside." She pulled her head back and tilted it upwards, a finger beneath her chin. "You haven't mourned, have you? You haven't even cried?"</p>
		<p>Noemí shook her head and avoided her eyes. She had been in a coma after the accident; by the time she woke, Amelia had been buried. "By the time I came out of the coma, Amelia and the baby had been buried for a long time." She whispered.</p>
		<p>Terri nodded to herself, never ceasing to look at Noemí. "Someone told me that tears can be good for the soul." She said softly, moving her hand up to stroke Noemí's soft hair. Terri found herself staring at her softly sensuous lips, wondering briefly what it would be like to kiss them. What is wrong with me? She thought with a small shudder, feeling Noemí's magnetism.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled dreamily, her hands grasping Terri's T-shirt at the sides, her eyes on Terri's lips. "I didn't think you were so sweet, Terri." She whispered, and let her head drop again, her arms wrapping around her waist and pulling her close as she buried her face against her stomach once more, strangely comforted by the warm feeling of life beneath the taut skin.</p>
		<p>Terri hugged her tightly to herself, kneading her shoulders and caressing her hair. After a long time, she said: "Want to talk while you watch me draw? I've developed a sudden urge to draw."</p>
		<p>Noemí pulled away and half-turned to look at the boxed canvases and paints. "When will you use those?" She asked, gesturing to them.</p>
		<p>Terri looked at them. "When I find my muse, since you don't want me to paint you." She explained, and smiled when Noemí blushed. She stroked her cheek, enjoying the closeness that they had developed in a matter of minutes. She bent down and took the notepad lying at the foot of the bed. She climbed onto the bed, and adjusted herself, back against the headboard. She patted the space beside herself. "Come, sit beside me and talk away. Tell me what ails you." She said lightly, knowing that their conversation will be a long one.</p>
		<p>Noemí obeyed, but instead she lay down, her head on her lap. She sighed softly. "I think I'm going to enjoy your stay here, Terri. I'm glad I decided that you move here, and that you finally accepted." She said, her arm wrapping around her legs. Suddenly, she sat up. "Shit, but I have to go to work!" She exclaimed and began to get off the bed.</p>
		<p>Terri grabbed her arm, and pulled her back down, firmly pushing her head back down onto her lap. "They won't miss you for a day." She said simply, and Noemí relaxed again, wrapping her arm around her legs. "I'm going to have to lean my pad against your head when I begin to draw." She said, and Noemí nodded her assent.</p>
