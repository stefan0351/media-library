		<p>Her eyes closed and her face peaceful, her long lithe body relaxed, like her face. "Amelia and I were perfect together, I thought so, she thought so, everybody thought so." She began softly, and Terri looked down at her. "I loved her so much, and she loved me. My parents adored her, and so did Vicki's, Vicki introduced us, and she loved her too." She shifted lightly, but her eyes stayed closed. "When- when she died," Her voice faltered, her arm around Terri's legs jerked. "When she died, and the baby with her," Terri could see her throat bobbing, hear her voice growing thick with tears. "Oh, God, the baby, it would have been so beautiful! I loved them both more than my own life, Terri. You don't understand how much-" She broke into tears.</p>
		<p>Terri stroked her hair and her face, tears of her own burning her eyes. "I understand, trust me." She said softly. "Don't stop, maybe telling me everything will help you heal."</p>
		<p>Noemí talked for a long time, about what their life was like, up until before the accident. About the love, the peace and laughter. The phone rang numerous times, but Terri didn't want to ruin the mood and Noemí didn't seem to hear it in her voyage through her memories. She took a deep shuddering breath and her arm tightened appreciatively. "When the accident happened, it seemed I was stuck in that wreckage forever." She whispered, turning her face onto Terri's lap, as if trying to cover her eyes from the horrible image of Amelia staring blankly back at her. "She," She continued shakily, her voice muffled by Terri's legs. "She died almost right away, maybe seconds after the car stopped crashing and twisting and turning. She looked at me right afterwards, I mean, the car was crushed and all, but she turned her head to look at me. It probably took the rest of her strength to do that. Her eyes were dying already, her breath cut off by the pressure of the dashboard crushing against her chest!"</p>
		<p>Noemí sobbed loudly into Terri's lap, and Terri's hand caressed the back of her head. She couldn't help it as her own tears ran down her cheeks. "The last thing she said to me-" Noemí choked out, her shoulders heaving. "She said before her eyes went blank: 'Our baby-', and that's it, her eyes lost that beautiful light, and I could do nothing but watch. My arms were caught on something, and I was trapped, and I couldn't even touch her, or say anything!" She sobbed for a long time, while Terri touched her hair and comforted her without words. She sobbed until spent, she couldn't cry any more. Then she asked softly, tiredly: "Do you know that I'm blind from my left eye?"</p>
		<p>Terri smiled softly. "Yes," She said softly, and looked up at the window, realizing that the sun was high. She looked at the alarm clock Natalie had set up for her the evening before, and realized it was almost ten thirty. She looked down at Noemí and realized Noemí had fallen asleep, just like that, her face softened and peaceful. A tender feeling for Noemí overwhelmed Terri again, and she tried to move her legs, wanting to go get the phone and call everyone to reassure them Noemí made it home okay. Noemí made a sound deep in her throat, and her arm tightened. Little by little, slowly and softly, Terri succeeded in removing her arm from around her legs and replaced her lap with one of her thick pillows. She leaned over her as she stood beside the bed, and kissed her temple softly. She moved quickly, avoiding the broken glass on the floor and retrieved the cordless from the kitchen, walking fast back to the bedroom, where Noemí had curled up on the bed like a child.</p>
		<p>She dialed the Leone's phone number, already knowing it by memory from last night's numerous calls to the house. Thomas picked up on the first ring, and sounded immensely relieved when Terri told him that Noemí slept safely in front of her. "We had a talk, Mr. Leone," She said in a whisper, stroking Noemí's hair and gazing at her sleeping face. "A long talk, I think that is what she needed. She had too much grief bottled up inside. It was a little hairy at first, but I think I got through to her. I made sure that she knew we were all worried too."</p>
		<p>Thomas sighed contentedly, and explained Natalie the situation. Terri could hear Natalie talking quickly in her relief, and Thomas comforted her with sweet words. He turned his attention back to the Terri. "I am so glad that she has talked to you about it. She never wanted to talk every time I tried." He said with a soft sigh. "She can loose it when she's like this, and it is hard to get through to her."</p>
		<p>He could hear Terri's smile. "I've been through a lot of things myself, and I let her understand, in not so many words, that I know where she stands where pain is concerned. I think she took me seriously, I think she trusts me." She said softly.</p>
		<p>Thomas, happy, hoped his daughter might become as close to the old Noemí as possible. He loved Terri all the more for trying to help Noemí. "Thank you, Terri, I really mean it. I think you're an excellent addition to our family." He said with genuine sincerity.</p>
		<p>Terri blushed and said shyly: "Thank you, Mr. Leone, any time I can help her like she's helped me I will."</p>
		<p>"Oh, child, call me Thomas!" He exclaimed with a laugh. "Listen to me, call Victoria, she has been calling here like a maniac, trying to find out anything about Noemí."</p>
		<p>"Gladly," Terri said, and looked through her notepad, where she'd written down Victoria's phone number. She said goodbye to Thomas, and clicked over the line, dialing Victoria's number. Victoria picked up on the half ring, Terri said softly: "She's here, Victoria, and she's sleeping."</p>
		<p>"Oh, thank God!" Victoria gasped and began to cry quietly. Terri could hear Michaela on the background, and then her soft voice came on the line.</p>
		<p>Michaela's voice came very pleasant and calmer now that they knew Noemí's whereabouts. "Thank you, Terri, Victoria has been impossible all night and morning. She's been going crazy, and now she can sleep a little," She said with gratefulness. "After she rains out those tears, I'm going to make her forget about real life and then I'm putting her to sleep. Why don't I have her give you a call in a couple of hours?"</p>
		<p>Terri laughed softly. "Sounds good." She said.</p>
		<p>"Good," Michaela said, and she paused to listen to something Victoria said. "Is she okay? She didn't get hurt?" She asked Terri.</p>
		<p>Terri looked Noemí closely. "She had gotten a little drunk during the night, but other than some hickeys from unknown person, she's perfectly fine." She said with a little humor.</p>
		<p>Michaela relayed the message, and Terri could hear Victoria's muffled voice, but she couldn't understand what she said. Michaela returned to talk to Terri again. "Let's give you a call in a few hours, let her sleep a little, and then we can talk about visiting for dinner. Okay?"</p>
		<p>"Okay." Terri said and they hung up with pleasant good-byes. Terri put the phone down on the bed, and walked around to the other side, climbing into bed as carefully as possible. Noemí made a noise deep in her throat, her eyes never opened as her strong arms reached out to pull Terri to herself, burying her face against the base of her neck, sighing contentedly. Teri could do nothing but wrap her arms around her neck, resting her head against a pillow, strangely comfortable. She closed her eyes and fell asleep with ease.</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Thirteen">
		<p>Noemí's head ached a little as she opened her eyes slowly, feeling as if the sunshine burned through her eyes into her brain. "Oh, God!" She murmured as she clenched her eyes closed again. She became aware of a small body, warm and supple, lying in her arms. The top of the dark head, pressed up against her chin, rested against her biceps, the soft hair tickled her skin softly. Aware of the swollen stomach pressing against her own, she looked down at the legs entwined with hers, and at her arm thrown carelessly across Terri's waist. She realized that Terri was lying in her arms, and she remembered the events of that morning.</p>
		<p>She opened her eyes again, and noticed the alarm clock on the dresser; it was already four o'clock in the afternoon. They had spent the rest of the morning and most of the afternoon sleeping in each other's arms. Noemí's eyes closed as she thought about that. A smile crossed her lips as she thought about her sleep, a dreamless sleep that has evaded her for years, and Terri made it possible with her gentle insistence. Noemí had to admit to herself that she never thought that Terri could be so gentle, and she blamed Terri's family for not allowing her to show her warmth instead of her cold side.</p>
		<p>The phone rang, startling Noemí out of her surprisingly peaceful musing. The phone was on the bed behind Terri's head and she jumped, startled from her sleep, and looked up at Noemí. Noemí smiled at her as she reached for the phone. "Hi, Vicki." She said, regretting when Terri rolled away from her and stood.</p>
		<p>Victoria sounded glad to hear her voice. She said: "Why don't we come over for dinner, and Michaela and Terri can cook while we talk?" Noemí, listening, watched Terri move around the room at the same time.</p>
		<p>She felt the sudden urge to hold her in her arms again. "Come over then. I want to apologize." She said softly, and Victoria laughed her rebuttal of the apology and, all forgotten, they hung up with an agreement to meet at six thirty. Terri had walked out of the room and Noemí could now hear the sounds of clanging bottles and swishing liquids. Noemí went out to the living room, looking down as her still booted feet crunched on the broken glass. She could hear Terri in the kitchen throwing something into the sink. Her confusion evident in her voice, Noemí asked: "What are you doing?" And realization hit her when she saw the empty bottles of liquor from her liquor cabinet beside the sink, and on the other side, three more left to empty. "What are you doing?" She demanded, moving forward and reaching for the bottle of Gin in Terri's hand. Terri dodged her reach and emptied the bottle.</p>
		<p>She reached for another one. "No!" Noemí said through clenched teeth, her hand grabbing Terri's wrist. Stubborn, Terri reached for another of bottles with her other hand, slamming it into pieces inside the sink. "Stop, please, I need that!" Noemí begged, grabbing her other hand.</p>
		<p>Terri's eyes were firm though gentle as she spun around to face Noemí. "No, you don't need that! You need food!" She said firmly, and pulled her hands away from Noemí's grasp. "I want to feel safe around you, when you're sober, and not half drunk like you are most of the time." She saw Noemí's hurt expression and her voice softened as she reached up to touch her face. "I'm not doing this to hurt you, Noemí, please understand me. If you don't stop, in a few years, you'll be fighting some liver disease from all the drinking. You know that."</p>
		<p>Noemí closed her eyes and leaned her forehead against Terri's, her hands holding her balance against the edges of the counter. She shook softly, her eyes closed tight. Terri felt her sweet warm breath, tainted with alcohol, against her lips. <i>It would be so easy to bend my neck and just kiss her.</i></p>
		<p>"It's hard, I want to have a drink now." Noemí whispered and Terri sighed.</p>
		<p>"I know you can't stop cold turkey, so how about we work a little system out?" She felt Noemí's nod against her head. "Do you want to go to AA?" She asked softly, and Noemí shook her head almost vehemently. Terri laughed softly, saying: "Okay, we'll do the home remedy. One drink when you get home and before you go to bed." Noemí groaned softly. "Eventually, we'll lower the dosage to one drink when you get home and then half a drink, then less and less. Until you don't want any more. What do you say?"</p>
		<p>"I say it sounds like fucking torture." Noemí said grudgingly. Terri smiled and kissed her nose softly; Noemí felt cared for. "We'll make it, I'm sticking by you. Another thing I'm doing in helping you cope with your loss. You can't cope if you're drunk all the time." She pointed out, pressing her index into her shoulder. She turned back to empty the remaining bottle and Noemí watched with a look full of pain on her face. Over her shoulder, Terri said: "Now, go take a shower, you sure need it."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Michaela and Victoria arrived at exactly six thirty, and Noemí knew that it had to do more with Michaela than with Victoria herself. She had never been punctual, and when she went to pick her up that day when Victoria first met Terri, Michaela had been with her at home also. To Noemí, Michaela seemed a great influence on Victoria. She said as much as they got formal introductions and smiled at each other warmly. She had just finished showering and changing into comfortable clothes when they arrived, her hair still dripping wet onto her face. Victoria couldn't help it; she reached over and ruffled her hair, making more droplets get onto her clothes. Laughing, Noemí returned the attack by grabbing Victoria by the face and pulling her face to her head, wetting her face and front of her shirt.</p>
		<p>Michaela laughed, and looked around at the living room. In the early evening, with the sun still out, the room felt more inviting and refreshing. "Where is Terri?" She asked.</p>
		<p>"In the shower," Noemí answered, wrapping an arm around Victoria's neck and yanking her to herself, kissing her cheek loudly. She seemed to remember her manners, and she invited them to sit down, offering them drinks. "Non-alcoholic, though. They're prohibited in this house now."</p>
		<p>Victoria's eyebrows arched in surprise. "Really, since when?" She asked in astonishment.</p>
		<p>"Since I acted like a fool this morning and almost broke a glass on her head." Noemí said, obviously ashamed of her behavior.</p>
		<p>Victoria jumped to her feet. "You what?" She said loudly. "Are you crazy?" She paced the living room, hands on her hips. Michaela's eyes were on Noemí with surprise. "She's a pregnant woman, Noemí!" Victoria said.</p>
		<p>Noemí nodded and looked even more ashamed; she stood and ran a hand through her hair. "I know, I know." She said shortly, gazing down at her feet. "I realized what I did when she ran from me, as if I were going to kill her."</p>
		<p>"By all means you were going to, Noemí." Victoria said, standing beside her and kissing her cheek. "I hope she keeps you in check and spanks you every time you falter." She said, and she was the old Victoria, the one that laughed and joked all the time.</p>
		<p>Michaela smiled at the two friends with a mix of pleasure. She wanted to meet Noemí, just because she was so important to Victoria and she loved her so much. Now they had met, Noemí talking with her with ease, as if they'd known each other for a long time. Michaela liked Noemí Leone. She looked at Victoria, and felt her heart turn over; she shoved back the feeling.</p>
		<p>A few minutes later, Terri came into the living room, all smiles. She smelled good and her hair dripped from the shower, picked up in a ponytail. She and Michaela go to the kitchen, each wanting to slap up a little something to eat. Noemí smiled at Victoria, and the best friends went outside, around to the back of the house, where the trees are dense, and green and pretty. Their surroundings were beautiful, the air so fresh to Noemí's lungs; she felt some peace after a long time. They stood in silence for a long time. "She's talked me into grieving, I guess." She said suddenly, her voice low and thoughtful, and looked at Victoria for a long time.</p>
		<p>Victoria smiled at her, and then continued to study the trees. "You didn't want to grieve. To admit that Amelia is gone." She asked softly after a while.</p>
		<p>Noemí crossed her arms over her chest, and stood in thoughtful silence for another while. "I guess I didn't," She said finally, biting her lower lips softly. "Because meant she was really gone, didn't it? That meant I was admitting I was alone, and all the time I knew I was alone, and that I was dying inside." She smiled softly, her eyes sad but peaceful. "Maybe this new baby, my niece or nephew, will be my salvation."</p>
		<p>Victoria clapped her on the back, and pulled her closer. "I love you, and believe me when I say that I like Terri, and that she seems like a good friend." She said softly close to her ear.</p>
		<p>"I love you too," Noemí said softly, kneading her lower lip thoughtfully. "And I like her too, she is good with me. She tells me like it is, you know?"</p>
		<p>Victoria chuckled and nodded. "Yeah, I know." She whispered, and they listened to the birds sing in the tranquility, and watched as the departing rays of the sun caressed the beautiful trees. Victoria said suddenly: "You remember Natty's birthday is in two weeks, don't you?"</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled and nodded. "Don't forget she is my mom." She chuckled.</p>
		<p>"What are you getting her?"</p>
		<p>"I haven't a clue."</p>
		<p>"Want to go shopping for something?" Victoria kicked at a pebble, sending it flying across to a tree bark.</p>
		<p>Noemí nodded.</p>
		<p>"Do you think you'll have a dinner?" Victoria sounded hopeful; the Leone's dinners were always fun. They sometimes invited more people than the house can hold.</p>
		<p>Noemí shrugged and smiled. She looked at Victoria for a long time and Victoria looked right back at her. "I feel some peace for the first time, Vicki." Noemí whispered. "It was like I needed to shed all those tears, I never did. I cried so much today, I couldn't believe it." The memory seemed more like a dream than a memory.</p>
		<p>Victoria wrapped an arm around Noemí's neck and pulled her close. Noemí responded and wrapped her arm around Victoria's waist. Victoria sighed. "I'm happy that Terri is here now, maybe she'll get you a little out of yourself." She said softly.</p>
		<p>Noemí chuckled softly, shaking her head no. "She is a great person, and I resent that my brother did what he did to her." She whispered.</p>
		<p>"Well, that's why you took her in, to pay back for what he did." Victoria said and remained quiet for a long time. "I think she likes the house." She then said.</p>
		<p>Noemí nodded and smiled. "Yes, she does." She said. They turned to look at the kitchen window, and watched as Michaela and Terri talked, busy with something. "So, Ms. Rich Girl Michaela Cavanaugh cooks, eh?" Noemí laughed softly.</p>
		<p>Victoria's eyes gazed at Michaela with something Noemí had never seen. "Yes," She said, and smiled. "And she cooks deliciously."</p>
		<p>Noemí pulled back and looked at her then punched her lightly on the shoulder. "Ha, you're in love!"</p>
		<p>Victoria feigned pain. "So?" She responded, punching her back. "There's nothing wrong with that, is there? Its about time I knew what it was like!" She threw herself upon Noemí, feigning brawling with her, and Noemí happily responded to her.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Michaela looked out the kitchen window at them. "I always knew Victoria was crazy, but Noemí?" She said with a laugh.</p>
		<p>Terri peeked out too, and laughed when she saw that Noemí and Victoria were rolling on the grassy ground of the backyard. "Yeah," She said. "I think Noemí has finally lightened up a bit." She paused and watched them, then she turned away to face Michaela. "I didn't know her before, but I know that the one I know, is not the one that belongs. It's good that she has begun to at least think of continuing with her life."</p>
		<p>Michaela nodded. "Thanks to your strong hand, though." She said with a flick of her finger. "It seems, from what Victoria has told me, that she has been drinking progressively for about two years, since her full recovery, and that they were never able to get through to her."</p>
		<p>Terri smiled absently, going back to chopping the lettuce. "Yes," She said. "When I was with Anthony, from my understanding of what he told me of his parents, they've always spoiled their children, even Victoria, who's not theirs." Michaela nodded agreement. "And when they saw that their daughter was falling apart, they tried to help her with unconditional love. Tough love works better when you're trying to help a child who is closed and not listening. Both Noemí and Anthony, in their own way are a handful."</p>
		<p>Michaela was smiling at her. "And how do you know all of this?" She asked teasingly.</p>
		<p>Terri smiled back and patted her growing stomach. "I already feel like a mother, and I'm thinking of what I'd do if my baby were in the situation Noemí is in." She responded.</p>
		<p>Michaela grinned at her, and they stopped their conversation when Noemí and Victoria came into the kitchen to join them. Both women were dusting each other off, shedding leaves and dirt freely. Michaela and Terri threw them out of the kitchen to clean themselves up, not wanting dirt on the food.</p>
		<p>When Victoria and Noemí returned to the kitchen, cleaner now, they sat down to eat, and talked about Natalie's birthday, about what presents to get her, and about names for Terri's baby. Terri said she hadn't thought of any yet, and reminded Noemí to eat her food.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>When Victoria and Michaela left, Noemí sent Terri to bed, having decided to do the dishes herself. Sleepy, Terri trudged down the hall and into her bedroom, not bothering to close the door. As soon as her head touched the pillow, she fell asleep. What seemed like minutes later, she felt a heavy shift on her bed. About to scream, she sat up frantically, to find someone sitting beside her on the bed. "It's me, Noemí." A soft whisper and Terri relaxed with a sigh, able to tell apart the shadow of Noemí's body in the darkness.</p>
		<p>"What's wrong?" She asked softly, feeling the bed tremble with Noemí's shaking. Noemí didn't answer. "Noemí?"</p>
		<p>"I can't sleep." It was another soft whisper.</p>
		<p>Terri looked at her alarm clock, and saw that it was already three o'clock in the morning. She reached out and touched Noemí's cheek softly; it felt cold to her warm fingers. "What have you been doing all this time?" She asked gently. She'd been asleep since about ten thirty. "Did you sleep at all?"</p>
		<p>"Trying." Noemí's voice came low and strained. "I can't close my eyes." She trembled, and made a move to get off the bed. "I'm sorry, I'll let you-"</p>
		<p>Terri reached out again and pulled her by the shirt back onto the bed. "Stay here." She said softly and lay back down, pulling Noemí down too. She felt Noemí shift on the bed with a contended sigh, resting her head on Terri's welcoming arm, throwing her arm over her stomach and pressing herself close. Her body trembled and Terri felt strange, being so small and taking care of such a big and strong woman. "What's wrong?" She asked softly, running her fingers through Noemí's hair.</p>
		<p>Noemí pressed her face against her shoulder, and she trembled. "I can't close my eyes," She said again. "I can't stop remembering."</p>
		<p>Terri felt a tender pity for Noemí, and touched her face with her other hand. "It's okay, you can close them now. I'm right here." She whispered, and turned her face to kiss her forehead gently. She felt Noemí relaxing against her, and soon, heard her soft breathing, indicating she had fallen asleep.</p>
		<p>When she woke the next morning, Noemí had already left.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Fourteen">
		<p>Noemí stood by the window in her office, looking out at the street below and smiling to herself.</p>
		<p>She'd had a surprise meeting upon arrival to the office; her employees, when she was around, tended to hound her and tell her every single small detail of what happened in the company. She was an efficient leader, and her employees felt insecure when she wasn't around. The meeting lasted no more than ten minutes, with her carefully teasing solution and dismissal of their complaints.</p>
		<p>She didn't turn when someone knocked on her door, but she said over her shoulder: "Come in."</p>
		<p>Camilla Cortez, the director of finances, stepped shyly in. She carried an envelope in her perfectly manicured hands; her brown eyes looked cautiously at Noemí's back. For the first time in years, she could see that usually rigid back relaxed. She relaxed too. "Ms. Leone, I need you to sign these." She said in her pretty alto voice. Noemí turned to her and gestured to one of the chairs. "Thank you," Camilla said as she sat and handed over the folder. "Those are just some paperwork for the purchases of property in Queens for the new office." She explained as Noemí read the papers inside. "When would you like to go see it?"</p>
		<p>Noemí looked up at her as if it had never occurred to her to see the property, which pleased Camilla because that meant Noemí, trusted her decisions. Surprised by the look on Noemí's face, she smiled tentatively; it had been so long since she'd seen her smile. Her white-blue eyes had a new light inside them that looked pleasing and attractive. Noemí shrugged and looked back down at the papers, reading. "How about now?" She asked thoughtfully.</p>
		<p>"Now is perfectly fine." Camilla said softly. "And then maybe we can have lunch?" She suggested almost without realizing it.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled softly and nodded thoughtfully. She stood suddenly, and put the folder down. "This can wait," She said, tapping it with a slender finger, and came around the desk to the door. "Let's go see the office."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>They decided to take Noemí's car, the more comfortable of the two. At the office space, Noemí nodded thoughtfully as she eyed everything about the space, taking her time with every detail. "I like it." She said, and turned around to smile at Camilla. "You have a good eye, Camilla."</p>
		<p>Camilla's cheeks flushed to a pink color. "Thank you, Ms. Leone." She said, self-conscious at the compliment.</p>
		<p>Noemí pushed her hands into her pockets and looked around one last time, and then she looked at Camilla and smiled again. "How about that lunch now?" She asked in her low voice.</p>
		<p>Camilla nodded, suddenly breathless. "Sure."</p>
		<p>They left the office space, talking as they walked to Pizzeria Uno's close by. Inside, they sat directly across from one another, smiling and talking. They ordered, and continued their conversation. Camilla, in awe of Noemí, realized that Noemí barely glanced at her before and said nothing more than a quick hello. Camilla knew of the death of her lover, and of how much Noemí had loved her. Noemí began to ask her about her family life, but stopped herself. "You don't mind me asking you all these questions, do you?" She asked in a low voice as they waited for their orders.</p>
		<p>Camilla laughed softly and relaxed against her seat. "No, no, I don't." She said, and in a moment of recklessness met Noemí's startling eyes. She felt breathless by their beauty. "I have always wondered what Noemí Leone was like outside the office."</p>
		<p>"You mean because I've been so rigid with everyone all this time?" Noemí asked with a smile, and Camilla flushed at being found out. She nodded, and Noemí looked down at the table. "Many things have happened to me that have caused me to be this way, but now I've decided to move along with my life, and do the best I can." She laughed softly. "I know it's sudden, it feels sudden to me, but I think my eyes have been opened." She paused, and met Camilla's eyes again. "Are you single, Camilla?" She asked suddenly.</p>
		<p>Camilla, caught unawares by the question, was speechless. The arrival of the waiter gave her time to recuperate. By the time he finished placing their meals on the table, she had gathered her wits. She shook her head. "Yes, Ms. Leone, I-"</p>
		<p>"Call me Noemí," Noemí said with a smile.</p>
		<p>"Noemí," Camilla said, and liked the taste of her name in her mouth. "A very beautiful name, how did your parents think of your name?" They were originally from Italy, that much Camilla knew, and she wondered at the Spanish sounding name.</p>
		<p>Noemí's smile grew. "They didn't." She said and laughed softly at the look Camilla gave her. "Actually, my nana René thought it up. She has been with my parents since before I was born. Her mother's name was Noemí, and she had taken care of my mom before René. My mother absolutely adored the woman, and she loves René too."</p>
		<p>Camilla smiled and they began to eat; she noticed how slowly Noemí ate. They chewed in comfortable silence; at times their eyes met, and Camilla couldn't stop attraction to Noemí from growing. She felt a response from Noemí also, and she grew bold. "I have something to say to you, Noemí." She said in a low voice.</p>
		<p>Noemí's eyebrow arched, and she looked at Camilla with question in her eyes.</p>
		<p>"I have had an attraction to you since I came into the company two years ago." She said softly, and looked down at her plate, expecting a rebuttal. She looked up at her when she didn't say anything.</p>
		<p>Noemí, sitting back on her chair, stared at her through unreadable eyes. Her smile teased Camilla, but then it was genuine. "Okay." She said with a nod.</p>
		<p>Afraid, Camilla asked softly: "Will this cause a problem?"</p>
		<p>Noemí seemed surprised by the question. "Why should it?" She said simply, and Camilla felt that everything was fine. Noemí reached over and stroked the back of her hand with slender fingers, then pulled back.</p>
		<p>Camilla felt a shiver run through her body from where Noemí's fingers touched her. She kept her eyes connected to Noemí's. "I- I don't know, because we work together?" She said in an uncertain voice.</p>
		<p>Noemí laughed softly, and pushed her plate away. "I don't think there would be any problem with that." She said in a low voice. "Occasional dinner and/or movie wouldn't hurt our working environment. I don't know about you, but I don't mix pleasure with business."</p>
		<p>Camilla shook her head and smiled. "Neither do I." She asserted.</p>
		<p>Noemí sat back on her chair, relaxed. She looked Camilla over slowly as she ate and smiled softly when she saw her flush red. Camilla, an attractive woman in her early thirties, had caught her attention. She was tall, though not as tall as Noemí, her body slender and attractive; she had sandy blonde hair picked up into a soft bun. She looked even better in dark blue slacks and a silk beige shirt that fell softly over her thin shoulders and full breasts. The muscles at her graceful throat were working as she chewed on her steak and Noemí wanted to kiss them. Camilla seemed to be in deep thought, and she looked up at Noemí. "Are <i>you</i> single?" She blushed.</p>
		<p>Noemí's smile turned sensuous. "I am single." She said huskily, her look heavy-lidded. She'd been horny before, but blush that spread across Camilla's cheeks reminded her of other kinds of blushes, and her body suddenly felt afire.</p>
		<p>Camilla's breath caught in her throat from the look in Noemí's eyes. She suddenly had nothing to say.</p>
		<p>Noemí realized that the ball was in her park. "Do you really want to return to the office?" She asked, and underlying beneath that question, lay an invitation. A dam was broken when she and Melanie had made love, and now it couldn't hold back the torrent of desire that now ran free.</p>
		<p>Camilla heard the underlying question, and breathless, she replied: "No, I really don't."</p>
		<p>Noemí's expression didn't change. "Do you live on your own, Camilla?" She asked, getting to the point.</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Oh, Camilla never expected this; this heat, this desire in this self-controlled woman.</p>
		<p>Noemí lay above her, strong and sweaty and her nude body moved along Camilla's nimbly, fast. Her kisses were hot fire on Camilla's lips, her soft tongue a kindling for the heat. Her hands were in Camilla's hair, loosening it, pulling it from the weak bun. Her moans were low, feral, her desire savage. Camilla's body couldn't help but respond to hers; her wetness came forth in great gushes. When Noemí touched between her legs, she was slick and ready for entrance. She spread her legs and cried out when Noemí entered her smoothly. Her perfectly manicured nails were scraping at Noemí's back; her teeth were sinking into her shoulder as her back arched. Her orgasms were quick, hard, stunning in their strength.</p>
		<p>Her back straightened as the tension of orgasm left her body; her impassioned cries seemed to echo off the walls in her bedroom. Noemí kissed her breasts, starting all over again, and she forgot once again about everything but Noemí's lovemaking.</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Fifteen">
		<p>Terri sat on her bed, and began to draw. She glanced at the clock, realizing that it was almost nine o'clock and the dinner she had prepared was getting cold. She already ate, and now waited for Noemí to get home; she feared that she had gotten drunk again. Her drawing this time, that of a sleeping Noemí, caught the detail of the long lashes resting against her cheeks, of her tousled hair falling over her forehead, of her lithe body curved like a child's sleeping on her side. She laid her head against the headrest and wondered why she couldn't get Noemí out of her mind long enough to draw something else.</p>
		<p>She started as she heard the sound of the key in the lock, and she went to the living room. Noemí smiled as she walked in and walked up to her. She kissed her forehead tenderly. Terri smiled up at her, but didn't fail to notice her wrinkled clothes or the smell of another woman's perfume that clashed with her usual cologne. Her shirt, open three buttons, had a lipstick stain at the collar; Noemí had pulled it out from her trousers, rolled the sleeves up carelessly. Her wet hair smelled of Herbal Essence. "I made dinner for you." Terri said in a low voice.</p>
		<p>Noemí threw her keys on the coffee table and turned to smile at her. "Great, because I'm starving." She said, to Terri's surprise, and made her way to the kitchen. She began to serve herself, but Terri urged her to sit and let her do it, since she made less of a mess.</p>
		<p>She placed the plate in front of her and sat to talk with her. Noemí dug into her food immediately, and moaned with satisfaction. Surprised, Terri watched as Noemí ate her dinner of mashed potatoes, corn and meatloaf hungrily. "How are you?" She asked Noemí, getting up and pouring her the agreed nightly glass of brandy.</p>
		<p>"I feel good," Noemí said between mouthfuls, and nothing more. She finished her dinner quickly and washed her own dish. She turned to Terri and smiled gratefully. "Thank you, it was delicious, and I'm sorry I came home so late."</p>
		<p>Terri nodded and left the kitchen; ignoring the glass, Noemí went after her and stopped her with a gentle hand on her shoulder. Terri spun around to face her, an unreadable expression on her face. "Are you angry because I missed dinner?" Noemí asked.</p>
		<p>Terri shook her head and smiled at her again. "Just call me when you're going to be late, Noemí, so that I know if I should cook for you or not." She explained, and Noemí nodded.</p>
		<p>"Okay, I'm sorry, I mean it." Noemí said softly, and smiled that endearing smile of hers again, her eyes crinkling a little at the corners. She looked around at the living room. "I need to get you a television, so that you don't get bored here by yourself."</p>
		<p>Terri shook her head and laughed. "No, no, I don't want to be a couch potato." She responded; she reached up and cupped Noemí's face gently with her hand, then turned to walk away.</p>
		<p>"Terri." Noemí said softly, and Terri turned around with question in her eyes, hearing something in Noemí's voice. "Can we talk?" Terri sighed softly and went to sit on the couch, looking up at her with silent question. Noemí sat beside her and half turned on her seat to look at her. "We're friends, right?" She asked, and Terri nodded, looking a little confused by the question. "Be honest with me, now." Again, Terri nodded. "I went to bed today with an employee of mine," A slight pause as she looked away from her to the window. Her eyes returned to Terri and she continued. "Do you think it is wrong, you know? I still love Amelia so much, and I feel so guilty beneath it all." She looked at Terri.</p>
		<p>Terri smiled, and couldn't stop herself from reaching out and touching Noemí's soft face again. She couldn't seem to stop touching her lately. "I don't want to sound insensitive, Noemí, but Amelia is dead." She said softly, and Noemí looked away, swallowing hard. Terri's eyes moved all over her face, and she took a deep breath, trying to stop the shaking inside her. "Amelia wouldn't have wanted you to suffer for her in the way that you have been for the past few years, I'm sure of it. From what I hear from every body, specially you, she was a wonderful person, and she wasn't selfish." Noemí nodded and looked at her again. "Do what you have to do." She grinned as she met her eyes. "So who is this woman?" She asked, punching her playfully, very lightly on the chin.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled, reaching for her hand and holding it gently in hers. "Her name is Camilla Cortez, and she is the director of finances. Very smart and attractive." She answered, and then shrugged. "I don't know what else to say about her, maybe I should get to know her."</p>
		<p>Terri smiled, and stifled a yawn, pulling her hand from the warmth of Noemí's. "Well, like I said, do what you have to do," She said, and stood up. "And have fun doing it." She stepped over Noemí's leg and made her way to the bathroom, a hand on her lower back. "God, my back hurts!" She said softly to herself.</p>
		<p>Noemí remained sitting on the couch, staring at her reflection on the darkened window. After a few minutes, she could hear Terri come out of the bathroom and go into her bedroom, she didn't close the door; seconds later, the light in there went off. Scratching at the scar on her thigh, Noemí stood, turned off all the lights, and went to the bathroom also, closing the door behind her. The bathroom, still warm from Terri's shower, had a lingering scent of strawberries that Terri smelled so beautifully of.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Shaking again, unable to sleep, Noemí lay on the couch. Blinking rapidly, she trembled as flashes danced behind her eyes. She moaned softly, and turned over on her side. Darkness surrounded her, and she unwillingly remembered the night of the accident as if it were yesterday. It was as if she dreamed with her eyes open, and her surroundings blurred...</p>
		<p><i>They are returning home, the light of Victoria's car behind them a comfort and companion. They are holding hands, talking away and listening to music. Amelia smiles and she feels her baby kick; she puts Noemí's free hand on her stomach to feel too. Ecstatic, Noemí can't wait until that baby comes out so that they can hold it, and snuggle it, and spoil it. The already love it so much, they're already making plans for its life, for when the baby grows old enough to go to college</i></p>
		<p><i>And suddenly the big bright lights come at them, already trying to swerve towards the correct side of the road, and hitting them on the side, sending them flying off the road, into a ditch</i></p>
		<p>The next images made her moan with fear.</p>
		<p><i>Noemí comes to, finding her right arm crushed between something hard on one side, and something sickeningly warm, soft and wet on the other Amelia's groan, her face turning to Noemí with frightening certainty, her voice hoarse and wet with the blood coming from within her body... "Our baby-" Our baby! Her last words, her eyes remaining fixed on Noemí, dead, dead Our baby! Noemí screaming loudly, frantically; she can't move, pinpricks of pain all over her body Victoria's voice screaming her name from far away, almost insane with fear and anxiety. Unable to move her face, pain when she tried, having to look at Amelia's dead face and eyes. Unable to close her eyes either, feeling that death would come if she did... Stench of blood, blood! And then her eyes closing without her wanting them to, and the cold cold unconsciousness!</i></p>
		<p>Noemí sat up with a jerk, her forehead wet with sweat. She fought the urge for a drink, knowing there remained only one bottle in the house; the one Terri had hidden somewhere to control her hunger for the alcohol. Wishing she had taken the drink Terri had poured for her before, she stood up and paced the room, groaning and stumbling when her toe crashed against the coffee table. She breathed hard, running her fingers through her hair; she could feel the sweat breaking out from her pores, drenching her shirt, her hair. She moved towards the hall, needing the closeness, the comfort. "Terri," She whispered softly, unable to move into the hall, not knowing if Terri would welcome her again.</p>
		<p><i>Fear!</i></p>
		<p>She felt along the wall as she finally walked down, feeling past doors, touching the only open one. She stood at the door, staring into the darkness towards where the bed would be, breathing harder, her body shaking more as she came closer to tears. By then, her hair had matted against her forehead, the sweat ran in rivulets down her face, and she didn't know what to do. She turned to the bathroom door, and opened the door softly. She turned on the light, and staggered to the sink. She turned on the cold water, and cupped her palms beneath it, bringing them to her face. The cold water didn't do anything to help her anxiety attack, and she shut it off, almost hyperventilating now.</p>
		<p>She straightened her back and looked into the mirror; someone stood behind her. She cried out, and lost her footing, ending on her buttocks on the floor, back against the wall. Then someone knelt besides her, touching her face, saying something in a soft sweet voice. She couldn't recognize the voice, and she looked up at the kind face. "Terri." She wheezed, and reached for her frantically. "Help me! <i>Help me!</i>"</p>
		<p>Terri held her tenderly, telling her to hang on, to relax, to breathe in, and breathe out. Slowly, Noemí. Breathe in, and breathe out. Soon, Noemí felt her breath relax, her face pressed against Terri's chest, her arms wrapped around her. "Why didn't you come to me, Noemí?" Terri asked her softly, touching her hair over and over. Noemí shook her head, and pulled back to look at her. She couldn't answer, and Terri pulled away from her and stood up, helping her stand also. "Come to bed."</p>
		<p>Terri tucked her into bed, covered her from shoulder to feet with the covers, uncaring of her sweat. Noemí still shook. Terri lay down beside her and Noemí reached frantically for her, pulling her close. She brought her legs under the covers and wrapped her arms around Noemí's neck, holding her tenderly close. "You know you can talk to me. Tell me, what's the matter?" She whispered softly.</p>
		<p>She felt Noemí shake her head, felt her bury her face against her neck. "I can't." She whispered against her skin, her hand at the lower plane of her back pulling her growing stomach tightly against her own flat stomach. The baby kicked its complaint against the pressure, but it didn't move again. Terri's hand moved lower along Noemí's long back, and she pulled her shirt up a little to allow the tips of her fingers to trail softly along the smooth skin of her lower back. The caress seemed to comfort Noemí and she lay still, her shaking stopping, and her breathing slowly deepening into that of sleep.</p>
		<p>Terri decided she had to talk to Noemí's parents, to at least let them know what was happening with their daughter, who seemed to be so at peace in the daytime, but at night, her nightmares took claim of her sanity.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Sixteen">
		<p>Beaming, Natalie began to open her presents. They all sat in the living room; her family and close friends surrounded Natalie. She lifted the cover from a box and grinned, lifting the two pairs- one red and one blue- of stockings Renee hand knitted for her. She grinned at Renee, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "Thank you." She said, kicking off her shoes and slipping on the red stockings. Everyone knew that Natalie loved walking around the house in stockings.</p>
		<p>The next present she picked up was the one Noemí brought for her. Flashing a smile at her daughter, she opened it quickly. Grinning, she pulled out the bottle of her favorite perfume, Oscar De La Renta, and threw a kiss at her across the room.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled at her mother from her place at the door. She stood there, arms crossed, leaning against the frame. Her eyes searched for Terri and she found that Terri had been looking at her, for some time. Noemí grinned softly, thinking about how beautiful she was, how her lustrous hair framed her face so becomingly, and how the peach colored maternity gown added to the beauty of her pregnant body.</p>
		<p>Terri, noticing the intensity with which Noemí gazed at her, felt herself feeling warm and blushing. She looked away, feeling her face grow hot. The truth was that she had been staring at Noemí for some time, and she could not get enough of seeing the aggressive beauty, the self-possessed pose with which she leaned against the doorframe. Her eyes, with their intensity, made her feel trapped when they gazed at her. Glad to see that face smiling, she thought about the past few weeks.</p>
		<p>Noemí had slowly stopped drinking, and she had spent more and more time in the house with her after work. Working only seven hours, she drove herself more gently and allowed herself to enjoy the house again. In the evenings, she had taken to listening to music while working out in the gym, something she never did before. After that, she came out and sat with Terri, even playing board games with her and talking about nonsensical things. She never touched the bedroom she had shared with Amelia, though, and just the thought of changing anything in it would scare her.</p>
		<p>Sometimes on the weekends, Camilla came over and spent time with Noemí. Terri could tell Camilla didn't like her, by the way Camilla looked at her when Terri walked around the house. Mostly, to Noemí's consternation, Terri tried to keep herself in the bedroom, out of Camilla and Noemí's way, but nevertheless, the looks Camilla gave her when she was around made her cringe. But what bothered her most was when Noemí left with Camilla and would not come back for hours, or until early the next morning. She could not bear to imagine what they were doing all that time.</p>
		<p>She snapped back to attention when everyone laughed and clapped at Victoria's outrageous gift for Natalie: a red silk lingerie nightgown. She couldn't help but feeling like she belonged as she joined in the laughter.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Days turned into weeks. Terri had been introduced as a new addition to their family successfully. Everyone present at Natalie's birthday party, other Leone's that knew the circumstances of Terri's situation, were graceful enough to not talk about it with their friends or anyone present. They liked Terri and they knew that her baby would be a beautiful one, proudly carrying the Leone blood and Terri's beauty.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Weeks turned to months. Christmas was almost here, and Terri's stomach kept growing and growing. She had taken the pregnancy beautifully; her stomach looked so big because she was so small, her dark hair had acquired that sheen of health, her skin a healthier color, even her eyes brightened and she was so obviously happy. No one knew, but Noemí had taken to sleeping in her bed with her every night; when she had tried alone, her anxiety didn't allow her to sleep. Even now, when Terri couldn't hold her, because she was so largely pregnant, Noemí slept with her. She slept across the foot of bed, sometimes, because Terri moved so much now and needed space.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>The second Friday before Christmas Noemí made it home early and found Terri sketching in the living room. She wore shorts and a T-shirt that strained against her bulging stomach; her hair wet and picked up in a ponytail. Her bare feet were tucked under her on the couch. Opening her suit jacket, Noemí sat beside her and peered at the drawing. She recognized the trees in her backyard and smiled. The way Terri brought things to life on paper was a little unnerving to her. Especially because Noemí knew Terri hadn't really had art classes other than the one in High School.</p>
		<p>Terri paused and looked up, smiling shyly at Noemí. "Hi," She said.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled back. "Hello. Have you eaten yet?" She inquired, knowing that when Terri began to draw she forgot about everything.</p>
		<p>Shaking her head sheepishly, Terri said: "No."</p>
		<p>Sighing, Noemí stood and removed her jacket, draping it over her shoulder. "You need to stop doing that, Terri." She admonished, stretching. "It's not only you that you have to think about anymore." She grunted.</p>
		<p>"I know, I just forgot." Terri said.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled softly, and touched her shoulder as she walked past the couch and made her way down the hall. "I'll order out." She said, unbuttoning her shirt as she went into the bathroom to shower.</p>
		<p>"You don't have to." Terri called after her, standing and following her. "I can fix something up." She stopped at the still open bathroom door.</p>
		<p>Removing her shirt, revealing a sports shirt underneath it, Noemí met her eyes and smiled. "Don't worry about it." She said gently, and turned away, kicking off her shoes, and beginning to remove her belt.</p>
		<p>Terri fought to look away from the well-defined arms and back. She cleared her throat and forced herself to turn away.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>As they ate the Fettuccini and veal Noemí ordered, Terri thought about her drawings. She was wondering if Noemí would ever let her really paint her by modeling for her. And if she did, how would she go about bringing Noemí's coppery hair color onto canvas. She was brought out of her thoughts by Noemí's voice. "What?" She said, shaking her head.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled. "Tell me about your family." She said slowly, her eyes looking penetratingly into Terri's. Terri seemed flustered, and Noemí reached over and patted her hand reassuringly. "You seem to know a little more about us than we do about you." She explained. She knew there had been some sort of abuse when Terri was younger, and she need to understand why Terri allowed Anthony to return even after he did what he did to her that first time.</p>
		<p>Terri's shoulders hunched around her ears protectively, and she stared down at her food.</p>
		<p>Noemí was about to tell her to forget it when Terri began to speak.</p>
		<p>"My mother's name was Imogene." Terri began haltingly, swallowing hard. "I don't know how she and my dad met, he never wanted to tell me. I only have a picture of her." She stopped, her shoulders falling away from her ears as if with defeat.</p>
		<p>"You didn't know any of her family?" Noemí asked incredulously. She couldn't imagine not knowing her whole family. It was hard enough realizing she had made hardly any contact with them in three years. "So it was only you, your brothers and your father?"</p>
		<p>Terri nodded, looking up at Noemí. "My mother died when I was born, that's really all I know." She said. "My dad no other family, so it was just us. My brothers always blamed me for my mother's death, and they beat me. Dad didn't really do anything to help me, he used to hit me a lot too." She laughed humorlessly. "Sometimes I wonder how I made it." Her eyes watered, but she held back the tears and clenched her jaw.</p>
		<p>"I'm so sorry." Noemí said softly, reaching for Terri's hand.</p>
		<p>Terri clenched her fist under Noemí's hand, unable to take the gentleness in Noemí's hand and eyes. "No, it wasn't your fault." She said between clenched teeth.</p>
		<p>"My brother did the same to you, didn't he? Except for the hitting part." Noemí said gently, and her gentleness sent a shiver through Terri, was unused to it.</p>
		<p>"I didn't want him that way." Terri whispered, meeting Noemí's eyes.</p>
		<p>Noemí knew the truth of that statement through Terri's eyes. She almost hated her brother for doing this to this young woman, who had to leave her home because of all the abuse she endured as she grew up. That he could take advantage of her situation angered her beyond tears.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Noemí was almost finished with her Christmas shopping. Most of the time during the long weeks before Christmas, Camilla had accompanied her, doing her own shopping also. "I haven't enjoyed Christmas in such a long time." Noemí said.</p>
		<p>It was December twenty-third, and Noemí and Camilla went to finish the last of their shopping.</p>
		<p>"So how is Terri?" Camilla asked Noemí, knowing that Terri, already seven months pregnant with Anthony's child, had Noemí's attention wrapped around her finger.</p>
		<p>"She is fine," Noemí responded as they strolled around the Queens Center Mall, looking around at the stores. She had a smile on her handsome face.</p>
		<p>Camilla slipped her hand into Noemí's, and they walked in companionable silence into JC Penney's. "When is she due?" She asked, trying to keep up the conversation.</p>
		<p>Noemí shrugged and her hand tightened slightly around Camilla's. "Our doctor says sometime in February, which is unbelievable, because she is so big already. I would think she'd be ready now." She said, and laughed softly, her eyes falling momentarily on Camilla. "She's getting cranky already, which is why she didn't look at you twice when I took you to the house. I guess she's used to the peace, or something." She shrugged her wide shoulders again.</p>
		<p>Camilla couldn't take her eyes off Noemí. She looked so good in light brown corduroy trousers, a black turtleneck and black steel-toe boots. Her coat, a waist length, light brown thick Columbia, fit loosely around her torso. She had her hair tucked comfortably into a black winter hat, still glistening with droplets of melted snow. She shifted the numerous bags on her other hand and turned her head to look at Camilla again with a soft smile that brightened her eyes. "I think we've done enough shopping, don't you?"</p>
		<p>Camilla smiled and nodded. She trembled when she saw Noemí's eyes do an once-over on her body, and knew she looked good in the clothing she chose specifically to impress her. Wearing tight blue jeans, black boots, and a red knitted sweater hanging off her generous breasts, she knew Noemí desired her; over it she wore a black shearling jacket. They passed a jewelry store, and she smiled, as Noemí seemed to be pulled like a magnet inside. "Whom are you buying jewelry for?" She asked.</p>
		<p>Noemí's eyes were on the pearl chains and earrings. "Terri." She said absently, putting the bags down and moving along the display case counters. The attendant, standing close by, walked over to her with a friendly smile and she asked him to pull out this and that combination. Camilla could see the soft smile on her face. Noemí had already bought Terri more than three presents, and Camilla couldn't help but feel jealous.</p>
		<p>They weren't in a relationship, but Camilla hoped that Noemí would finally realize that Camilla had fallen in love with her. Everyone at the office already knew of their liaison, and they said nothing, having already been warned by Noemí that if anyone insults Camilla's integrity, they would be fired. No one had anything to say, really, work continued at the same pace regardless of the relationship between Camilla and Noemí.</p>
		<p>Noemí turned to face her, pearl necklace and earrings lifted in her large hands to display for Camilla. "What do you think?" She asked. "It's a present for her, for the Christmas party tomorrow. They'll look perfect with that maternity gown mom bought her for the party." She explained.</p>
		<p>Camilla didn't smile, but Noemí didn't notice, because she had already turned to talk to the shopkeeper, pulling out her credit card.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Terri," Noemí called, walking into the house with bags on hand. She didn't even notice the much warmer temperature in the house; she couldn't wait to give her the earrings and necklace. She dropped the bags next to the door. "Where are you?" She called when she went to the kitchen and didn't find her there. As she returned to the living room, Terri walked in, large stomach bared, tight T-shirt pulled up above it, and shorts pushed down beneath it. Barefoot, she padded her way towards Noemí, a wide-eyed look in her eyes. Noemí could see that she had been sleeping; her hair was a mess over her shoulders. Noemí smiled at her, thinking she looked adorable, and reached into the pocket of her jacket, looking excited. "Look at what I bought you, for tomorrow's party." She said, and walked to her.</p>
		<p>Terri looked at the palm-sized velvet box uncomprehendingly, still not fully awake. Then she smiled uncertainly at Noemí and took the box. "What is it?" She asked with a hoarse voice.</p>
		<p>Noemí grinned, and guided her to the couch with an arm around her shoulders. "Look at it, I think you'll like it." She said gently, helping her sit down without dropping on her weight.</p>
		<p>Terri did, and gasped, her eyes fixed on the pearls. Speechless, her jaw dropped. Her eyes shifted from Noemí back to the contents of the box. "I-"</p>
		<p>Noemí touched a finger to her lips, realizing just how soft and smooth they were. "Don't, I know you like them by the look in your eyes." She said gently, and looked down at the jewelry. "I saw them and I knew they were perfect for you." She leaned forward and kissed Terri softly on the cheek, taking a deep breath and inhaling that sweet fragrance she associated with Terri.</p>
		<p>"It's beautiful, Noemí," Terri whispered, and sat quietly as Noemí's fingers worked nimbly on her tiny studs, removing them and replacing them with the pearls. She watched as Noemí reached into the small box and pulled out the chain of pearls, clasping it around her neck.</p>
		<p>"Lets go see it in the mirror." Noemí said softly, and helped her stand, holding her hand as they walked to the bathroom. Terri gasped softly as they stood under the white light of the bathroom, admiring the way the chain and earrings made her graceful neck even more beautiful. Noemí stood tall behind Terri, her hands on her shoulders, gazing at her reflection in the mirror. "You're beautiful, Terri," She whispered, pressing her lips tenderly against the back of her head, her eyes closed with emotion.</p>
		<p>Terri's lips curved softly into a tentative smile. "Thank you." She whispered, aware of Noemí's body pressed behind her, of her hands on her shoulders, then moving up to trail fingers along her neck. "I love it." She stifled the tremble that began from deep inside her, and met Noemí's incredible eyes in the mirror. Her heart skipped a beat, and she moved away from her, leaving the bathroom and returning to the living room to retrieve the box. Her hands were shaking as she took off the jewelry, and she didn't know what to do to stop it. For weeks now, she had been fighting her intense and growing attraction to Noemí, and she could feel herself loosing the battle. She blamed the pregnancy for this; the raging hormones of pregnancy could be her only explanation for this.</p>
		<p>For the past few weeks, while Noemí hadn't been in the house, she had imagined herself kissing her, had wondered what it would feel like to touch her lips with her own. She had talked to no one of this, not even Victoria, who had become a close friend to her, who visited her almost every day and sat with her and played board games with her to keep her from getting bored. She went with her every other day to the Lamaze classes because Noemí seemed to shut down and freeze even when just the name was mentioned. Sometimes she had been tempted to talk about it, and she knew Victoria sensed something needed talking about, but Terri clamped her mouth shut and said nothing.</p>
		<p>"I made dinner, take your jacket off." She said shortly, and went towards the kitchen.</p>
		<p>"Terri, are you okay?" Noemí asked innocently, following her into the kitchen, removing her jacket.</p>
		<p>"Fine." Terri said shortly, plate in hand, serving her dinner. She gestured her to sit down and placed the plate in front of her.</p>
		<p>Noemí stared at her, confused. "Did I do something wrong?" She asked, and felt foolish when Terri laughed at her, saying that no, she did nothing wrong.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Seventeen">
		<p>Camilla, already there when Noemí and Terri arrived, talked with Victoria and Michaela. Victoria and Michaela's eyes lit up at the sight of Terri, who was dressed in a graceful green maternity gown that fit her perfectly. Camilla looked her over, and went to Noemí, who took her hand and kissed it softly. "Hi," She whispered.</p>
		<p>Noemí pulled back and looked her over, making a show of licking her lips just for her. "Beautiful," She breathed, and took her into her arms, kissing her softly. "Gorgeous." She whispered against her lips, then pulled back and looked at her again.</p>
		<p>Camilla, pleased that her dress had the effect she desired, grinned. It was low cut, a few inches above her knees, and some cleavage showed, flowing freely from there down. She found the highest heels to accentuate her shapely legs. "I've met most of your family," She said with a smile. "They are wonderful."</p>
		<p>"I'm glad you like them." Noemí said, realizing Terri had left her side. Her eyes found her across the room; talking with her cousin, who introduced her to his teenaged children; he and his family had not been there at Natalie's party. He gestured to her stomach and said something, to which she grinned, patting it proudly and saying something in return.</p>
		<p>Noemí turned to Victoria and Michaela, whistling softly in admiration, and hugged them both. She pulled back and looked them over. Michaela wore a classy and impossibly tight red gown; red lipstick made her sexy lips thicker and sexier. She had her hair picked up in a bun behind her head, with strands dropping out prettily over her cheeks. Victoria sported a two-piece suit, almost like a tuxedo, without the bow. She had just cut her hair into a short curly mass and looked very handsome. "You two look great!" Noemí said with a smile.</p>
		<p>"So do you." Camilla said, fingering the sleeve of her sweater. Noemí's sweater, a loose beige V-neck, fit her torso perfectly; she wore it over a white round-neck T-shirt, pleated black trousers and black shoes. Her hair fell over her forehead, like usual, and shone. She looked comfortable and handsome at the same time.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled at her and pulled her close to plant a kiss on her forehead. "I have to find my parents." She said, pulling away. "Be right back."</p>
		<p>Natalie and Thomas stood together in the center of his studio, surrounded by their family and friends, speaking with Natalie's older brother, Daniel. "Hi, uncle!" Noemí said when he took her into his arms in a bear hug, happy to see her smile again. She had always been his favorite niece, because unlike his own daughters and other nieces, she had always liked to do things he liked to do. As she grew up, he used to take her fishing with him, and they used to play football with his sons and other nephews.</p>
		<p>With the promise that they would go fishing after the winter was gone, he left her to talk to her parents. Natalie wrapped her arms around her daughter, grabbing her face and pulling her down, kissing her tenderly on the forehead. "Hi, mom." Noemí said with a big smile and her felt her dad touch her back gently.</p>
		<p>"How are you, my love?" Her mother asked, smiling up at her tall daughter and wrapping her arms around her waist to pull her into an embrace. "Where is Terri?"</p>
		<p>Noemí nodded and hugged her mother, beaming a smile at her father. "I'm great, merry Christmas." She answered and kissed them each. "And Terri is somewhere in the living room with Joseph."</p>
		<p>She left them to find Terri and went back to look for Camilla, wanting to dance a little; the softly playing music felt nice. She ran into René, who bustled about bossing around the caterers, and wrapped her arms around her ample waist, pulling her off her feet and spinning her around. René slapped her on the arm when she put her down and kissed her cheek lingeringly, the expression of pure motherly love unmistakable in her eyes. She dragged her into the kitchen, gave her one of her delicious biscuits and sent her on her way with a tender pat on the behind. Still chewing the ends of her biscuit, Noemí found Camilla, who nursed René's famous eggnog. She looked like she was enjoying the conversation she had been having with Noemí's cousin Martha.</p>
		<p>Noemí, with a silencing wink at Camilla, came behind her cousin and wrapped her arms around her, lifting her off her feet and kissing her neck. Her cousin laughed delightedly, having realized that the only one who would greet her like that was Noemí. "Noemí, Noemí!" She called out loudly, happily. She was the wild one in the family, with spiked red hair and a large ring on her nose. She was also a lesbian, and she was in the circle of friends that Noemí and Amelia used to hang with before the accident. The way her cousin had greeted her could only mean that she had come back from that deep depression. When Noemí put her down, she spun around and they hugged tightly. Her eyes resembled Noemí's, only that hers were not as luminous a light blue as Noemí's. Her father had been Thomas' late brother, Theodore.</p>
		<p>"Hi, Mart!" Noemí said onto her shoulder, hugging her tightly. She pulled back and looked Martha's attire over, shaking her head and laughing. She had always been outrageous. Tonight, she wore a deep red velvet dress and black combat boots over very white stockings; her nose ring had a chain that was attached to one of her numerous earrings. "You look wonderful." She said with a laugh.</p>
		<p>Martha posed, her very red lips pursed sexily. Pretty in her outrageous way, Martha attracted enough male and female attention with <i>and</i> without the weird garb. "Why, thank you!" She said, and jumped into Noemí's arms again, kissing her cheek lingeringly.</p>
		<p>Camilla watched with a smile, sipping from her drink. She looked around, thinking. The whole family seemed to be pleasant, they obviously loved each other very much, and she wondered that the whole family didn't say anything or look at Martha strangely, as if her dress were normal. Camilla mused that her family would be whispering behind her back if she dared to dress like that. She caught Terri looking at her with expressionless eyes, and cocked her head to the side, arching her eyebrows cynically in question. Terri looked away and continued to talk with Victoria and Michaela. Camilla forgot about her when Noemí took her into her arms and began to dance with her.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"She loves Noemí." Terri said to Victoria, looking away from Camilla and meeting her eyes.</p>
		<p>Victoria's eyebrows arched. Well, well! "There's nothing wrong with that, Terri." She said softly, giving Michaela a glance; Michaela seemed to be thinking the same thing. She stood with arms crossed and eyebrows arched.</p>
		<p>Terri nodded and then shrugged, sipping from her glass of orange juice slowly. "I know," She said, looking at the dancing couple again; they were dancing, very slowly, as if oblivious to the fast-paced music. Camilla's arms were thrown over Noemí's shoulders, Noemí's arms around her waist holding her close. They talked in hushed tones, whispering close to each other's ears and occasionally kissing. Their bodies seemed to be synchronized, their hips moved against each other very slowly. Terri got an image of them making love, and she couldn't bear it. "I don't want Noemí to love her." She blurted, and then looked away from Victoria and Michaela's surprised eyes, blushing.</p>
		<p>"You don't?" Victoria asked breathlessly, and she reached over to touch Terri's shoulder gently. "Why?" She said softly. She suspected something like this was what Terri had seemed so preoccupied with these past few weeks.</p>
		<p>Terri shook her head, and seemed confused. "I have no idea." She said softly.</p>
		<p>"Do you love her?" Michaela asked gently.</p>
		<p>Terri's gray-brown eyes met hers with thoughtful indecision. "I love her, yes." She whispered and shook her head. "She's done so much for me."</p>
		<p>"No," Michaela said looking into her eyes deeply. "I mean, do you <i>love</i> her?"</p>
		<p>"I don't know." Terri said, comprehending her question. She looked down at their feet, struggling with her feelings.</p>
		<p>Victoria moved closer to her and wrapped an arm around her, looking over at Noemí, whose eyes met hers with question over Camilla's shoulder. She shook her head and winked.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Noemí came up behind Terri, leaning a little over her shoulder and looking at her face. "Are you enjoying yourself?" She asked Terri, smiling down at her.</p>
		<p>Terri returned her smile and avoided her eyes by looking at everyone except her. "Yes." She responded. "Your family, they're great people, specially your cousin Martha. She's fun."</p>
		<p>Noemí wrapped her arm around her shoulders from behind and pulled her close. "I'm glad you like them, they like you too." She said tenderly, placing a kiss on her temple and squeezing her gently.</p>
		<p>Terri laughed to hide her nervousness at her nearness, she reached up and squeezed the arm that embraced her; it was muscled and strong. The body pressed against her back wasn't doing much to help her heart start beating either. "Yes, I noticed," She replied. "Some of them want to cut off Anthony's weenie, others wish it would fall off already, etc, etc."</p>
		<p>Noemí laughed softly close to her ear, never removing her arm from around her. Terri felt as if her nerves were connected to the warm and strong body pressed against her back. "We all love him dearly," Noemí said seriously. "But he's a bastard. What he did to you was really irresponsible, to take advantage of you being alone; most everyone here thinks you are the sweetest thing to touch this planet."</p>
		<p>Terri couldn't stop the flush that stained her cheeks. "Really? You think so too?" She asked meekly.</p>
		<p>Noemí turned her to wrap both arms around her waist, smiling at her and pulling their stomachs together. "Yes, even though I know how bossy you can be." She said in a low voice and chuckled softly, her eyes traveling the soft planes of Terri's face as if really noticing her for the first time. The slender eyebrows arched naturally, her nose was small and straight, her pinkish lips were slender too, and the lower lip pouted softly. She wanted to kiss them. She liked the feel of her flat stomach pressing against the protruding hardness of Terri's. She looked up above them, smiled mischievously and looked down to meet her eyes. "Do you believe in mistletoes?" She asked, and Terri looked up above them also and saw the little green leaves twirling there. She hadn't noticed them the whole night.</p>
		<p>"Are you drunk?" She asked breathlessly, her hands tightening on the muscles of Noemí's arms. Her heart was beating out of control.</p>
		<p>Noemí chuckled softly, and shook her head. "Well, do you?" She asked softly, her eyes moving back and forth from Terri's eyes to her lips.</p>
		<p>Terri could see the nervous pulse of Noemí's throat, could see her jaw working softly. Noemí swallowed hard, her neck muscles bobbing. "And Camilla?" She asked, avoiding the subject, because she could see in Noemí's eyes that if she said yes, she would be kissed like she'd never been kissed before. She wouldn't know how to deal with that.</p>
		<p>Noemí's arms tightened around her gently, and she laughed softly, and a little nervously. "Yes or no?" She asked, her voice husky, her eyes narrowing as she swallowed hard.</p>
		<p>Terri closed her eyes and swayed. "Yes." She whispered, before she could stop herself.</p>
		<p>She heard Noemí whisper softly, brokenly. "Merry Christmas."</p>
		<p>It was like her heart stopped when she felt Noemí's warm lips press against her own for a brief moment, her heart threatened to beat out of control. She staggered back when Noemí pulled her lips away, looking down at her for a long time. A slow smile crossed her lips, and Terri looked around at the people around them. No one seemed to have noticed the kiss. Except for Camilla, who stood on the other side of the room, arms crossed over her chest, an angry look in her eyes. Terri turned away from her and said nothing to Noemí as she walked away, leaving her looking after her with a confused expression.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Terri was in Thomas' study when Noemí finally found her, the lights off, and only the fireplace sending gentle warmth throughout the room. She sat on his chair, head leaning against her hand as she dozed. Noemí crouched beside the chair, gazed at her for a long time. She then touched her thigh softly. It was almost three in the morning, and already, people were leaving with their sleepy children.</p>
		<p>Terri sat up and yawned, Noemí touched her stomach gently. "Lets go home." She said when Terri noticed her.</p>
		<p>Terri nodded, and then paused. "What about Camilla?" She asked hoarsely.</p>
		<p>"She had to go, her family was having a reunion too." Noemí answered with a smile, and stood to help her stand up. "Let's say bye to mom and dad, and then we go. Michaela and Victoria already left, but they send their kisses. They're coming over to the house tomorrow anyway."</p>
		<p>Terri nodded, and allowed her to help her stand. They left the study together.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Eighteen">
		<p>Terri stepped through the door; Noemí held it open for her and followed her in. Terri stripped off her jacket and kicked off her shoes, her feet aching, and went to the window to stare at the beautiful white snow capping the trees. She crossed her arms over her chest and looked out at the shiny white night. She sighed, and listened to Noemí move around the living room, removing her jacket, her sweater and her shoes too. Tears stung her eyes, she felt lonely, full of need, and worst all, confused.</p>
		<p>Noemí groaned, and rubbed her feet. "My feet are killing me," she whispered hoarsely, and stood up tentatively. She looked at Terri, who stood very still by the large window, and walked up to her. She touched her shoulder gently, and felt it shaking slightly. "Oh, Terri, what's the matter?" Noemí asked, worry tightening her heart. Terri pulled her shoulder away, and lowered her head.</p>
		<p>"I've never had such a good Christmas, Noemí, <i>never</i>." She whispered brokenly, and cried.</p>
		<p>Noemí whispered her name and wrapped her arms around her waist, curving her palms over Terri's stomach, stroking gently. She kissed the back of her head and felt her heart swell at the soft feel of Terri against her. Her silky hair brushed her face and the fresh scent of strawberries penetrated her nostrils. "This is just the beginning, Terri, don't worry. There'll be more, you'll see." She whispered, inhaling deeply. "My family loves you, they're <i>your</i> family now too."</p>
		<p>Terri bit her lip, and enjoyed the feel of Noemí's arms around her, and of her hands caressing her stomach; she turned her head, and pressed her forehead against Noemí's jaw. She felt Noemí's head moving, felt her breath against her forehead, her lips against her skin. "Noemí," She whispered, feeling the strong body pressing against her back, inhaling the sweet musk scent of her skin. "I'm so lonely!" She whispered brokenly.</p>
		<p>Before she could say anything more, Noemí's lips were on her own, pressing gently, questioningly. The fluid motion of Noemí's lips against hers, the way their mouths fit together sent electric shocks through her. She couldn't stop the long groan that escaped her throat; she couldn't stop her mouth from opening to Noemí's soft tongue with longing. She felt Noemí pull her body back; her hands urged her to turn around with gentle pressure on her shoulders.</p>
		<p>She spun around, and their lips met again, their stomachs pressed together, and she felt the baby kick against Noemí's stomach. She suddenly ached between her legs, could feel the muscles clench there. Her head felt light and she gasped softly.</p>
		<p>Noemí pulled back and kissed her forehead gently, murmuring her name softly. Her hands cupped her face, and she kissed her again deeply, passionately. "Terri." Breathless, the way she said her name, the way she touched her cheeks softly as their eyes met in the semi-darkness. She leaned her head down again, her eyes closing softly; meeting her lips and kissing her once more, her tongue urging her mouth open again and touching her own. She groaned, and their kiss became slower, softer, gentle and full of discovery. She felt Terri's hands move up her arms to her shoulders and squeeze the muscles there reverently. "Lets go in the bedroom, Terri." She whispered, suddenly wanting more than just kisses, and guided her through the dark down the hall and into her bedroom.</p>
		<p>Terri's legs trembled, and she feared they wouldn't hold her up as the ache between her legs intensified; she had never felt this ache, this rush. Right next to the bed, Noemí took her into her arms again and kissed her deeply, passionately. She reached behind her neck and unzipped her dress slowly, their lips never ceasing their meeting. She groaned when she felt Terri's soft hands beneath her shirt, touching the smooth skin of her lower back. Slipping the gown off, she bent lower to kiss Terri's now bare shoulders gently, letting her teeth sink into her flesh tenderly.</p>
		<p>She undid the bra from its harness between Terri's breasts, and slipped it off gently, letting her hands cup her heavy breasts softly. "Oh, God, Terri, do they hurt?" She asked with a groan, touching the erect nipples gently with her thumbs. She felt a rush of heat come between her legs from the tips of her sensitive fingers. The nipples were hard and she felt Terri tremble almost imperceptibly against her palms. She kissed her gently, and pulled her lips only slightly away. "Do they hurt?" She breathed against her lips; her heart was beating fast, and she felt like it would pump through her skin.</p>
		<p>Terri threw her head back; her nipples growing even more erect under Noemí's gentle thumbs. "No, it's-" Her voice broke into a long groan as Noemí bent lower to kiss each nipple. Soon she was lying on the bed, wearing nothing but her panties, the fully clad Noemí leaning over her, her taut flat stomach brushing Terri's; she licked each engorged nipple with a maddeningly soft tongue. Terri bit her lower lip, her fingers running through Noemí's hair, urging her not to stop her caress. She never thought this would be so wonderful, the electric-like shock rushing through her body with each tender lick of a nipple, each tender bite and suck. And the thought that it was happening with Noemí made her moan loudly. She felt weak; she couldn't resist Noemí's touch.</p>
		<p>Noemí groaned softly, moving down to kiss her hard stomach, to caress it reverently with her hands. "So, beautiful, Terri, you're so beautiful!" She whispered, and kissed all around it. She pressed her hands against the stretched skin of her lower stomach and felt the baby kick again. "Terri&#133; Terri!" She gasped. "Does it hurt you when the baby kicks?" She seemed so innocent to Terri, so endearing with her soft questions, and Terri couldn't answer her in her realization of how deep her feelings were for her. Noemí moved up to lie besides her, touching her face softly with her fingers. "Does it hurt?" She asked again and felt Terri shake her head. "What does it feel like then?" She whispered, kissing her eyes closed, her cheeks, her lips again.</p>
		<p>"Like," Terri said in a very low breathy voice, her fingers moving through Noemí's hair and massaging the back of her head. She couldn't think. "Like&#133; I don't know; it doesn't hurt though." She moaned softly when Noemí kissed her softly, her smooth lips caressing hers as she pushed an arm beneath her head to cradle her. Terri's hands moved from her face to wrap around Noemí's torso, her hands reaching beneath her shirt again to touch the skin of her back. Noemí's kiss became passionately hot as Terri's fingers worked around her ribs to touch beneath her breasts. She suddenly sat up and yanked off her T-shirt, leaning back down and cradling her head again as she kissed her once more. She shuddered long and hard when Terri's fingers brushed her nipples, hardening them and stroking them over and over again.</p>
		<p>Terri groaned when Noemí's nipples hardened against her fingers, when Noemí's hand moved shakily down her stomach to slip fingers beneath the waistband of her panties. She gently kneaded the swollen flesh right below her abdomen, and moaned softly. "You're so swollen, Terri, does it hurt there?" She whispered against her ear, licking and biting the lobe gently. Terri shook her head, biting her lower lip and stiffening as Noemí's fingers moved lower. "It's okay, it's okay, Terri. I promise it's okay." Noemí whispered brokenly, her voice shaky, and moved her fingers lower against her, until they were soaked in her wetness and cradled in her swollen need.</p>
		<p>Terri's back arched suddenly, her chest heaved with each breath as Noemí's fingers began stroking her softly; her legs fell wide open. Noemí whispered breathlessly, murmuring against her ear as her fingers stroked and caressed her for a long time. Suddenly, she moved her lips down to Terri's chest. "Oh, God, Terri," She groaned against her nipple softly, stroking her engorged clitoris gently, cradling it between her long fingers and moving them from side to side softly.</p>
		<p>Noemí moved down suddenly, pushing Terri's panties down and sucking her engorged flesh into her mouth. Terri felt like lighting shot into her from where Noemí's mouth was between her legs; her silky tongue parted her and tasted hungrily. She reached down and grasped Noemí's hair tightly in her small fist, her body buckled; she was so sensitive, she thought she would die if this continued. She pulled Noemí's head up, and Noemí went willingly, replacing her tongue with her fingers, continuing the caress against her clitoris. They kissed open-mouthed, deeply, Terri tasting herself on Noemí's lips as Noemí pushed her tongue deep into her mouth.</p>
		<p>Terri's palms pressed shakily against her back, the nails digging into her flesh causing arousal instead of pain. She groaned loudly and her back arched, her breathing short gasps, and she was on fire as orgasm stormed through her, hard, for a long time. She never felt anything like this before, this melting of her insides, this rush through her body like fire through her veins. Her palms slapped against the bed and grasped the covers as she shuddered and moaned. She lay panting, paralyzed with shock, her hair falling over the side of her face wet with sweat, pressed against Noemí's bare shoulder. She felt aftershocks rack her body all of a sudden, starting from the point between her legs.</p>
		<p>Noemí shifted, never letting her go, slipping her fingers softly from between her legs and trailing them wetly across the surface of her stomach. She was breathing hard also, and she lifted her lips from her sensitive nipples to touch Terri's lips softly. Their tongues and lips met passionately. Then Terri, not knowing what to say, buried her face into the crook of her neck, aware of Noemí's breasts pressed against her own and her arms around her body gentle. Noemí's lips left hers to touch her forehead, to kiss tenderly along eyebrows, her eyelids, her nose, her chin, and then her lips again.</p>
		<p>She lay down on her side, and pulled Terri to her, cradling her head against her shoulder, wrapping her arms around her. Terri was tired and feeling warm now; she wrapped her arm around her waist. They fell asleep holding each other.</p>
		<p>Noemí woke at about ten o'clock in the morning, a hand on Terri's waist, her trousered leg pressed between her legs. She lifted her head to look down at her body; her eyes lingered on her full breasts, her swollen stomach, and her beautiful face. She tried to pull away, in shock, knowing fully well what she'd done. She pulled away slowly, trying not to wake her. When she succeeded, Terri only stirring a little, she got up from the bed and left the room. She brought her hand to brush her hair back and caught the scent of Terri's sex on her fingers. She brought it to her nose, and swayed on her feet from the delicious odor lingering there. She remembered when she had knelt between her legs, the sweet taste of her. "Oh, God!" She gasped, and moved unsteadily to the living room.</p>
		<p>She flopped down on the couch and reached for the telephone on the table beside the couch. She dialed, and waited with her breath caught in her throat. Victoria picked up, sounding very awake. "Vicki," Noemí said in a whisper. "Vicki, I need to talk to you."</p>
		<p>Vicki shushed Michaela, who was making a racket with what sounded like kitchenware. "What is it, Noemí?" She asked, sounding concerned.</p>
		<p>"Can you come over, please?" She whispered, twisting around to look down the hall, afraid that Terri had woken also and was at the end of the hall looking at her.</p>
		<p>Victoria said something to Michaela, who said something sounding like okay. "Well, she was about to start breakfast, but I guess she can do it in your house. Cook for all of us." Victoria said and Noemí agreed. "Be there in like twenty minutes." As she hung up the phone, Noemí could hear her say to Michaela: "Leave it like that, we'll pick it up later." And line went dead.</p>
		<p>Noemí made her way back to the room, and quietly retrieved her shirt; she then went to the bathroom, and washed her teeth.</p>
		<p>True to her word, Victoria and Michaela arrived twenty minutes later. Michaela, knowing that Victoria and Noemí needed to talk, made her way to the kitchen. Victoria wrapped an arm around Noemí's shoulders and pulled her towards the window. They both stared out the window at the snow for a long time, Noemí not knowing how to start. "What's up?" Victoria finally asked, sitting down on the wide sitting berth of the window.</p>
		<p>Noemí sat beside her and stared at the floor. "Something happened last night." She said after a long time.</p>
		<p><i>Oh, boy</i>. Victoria looked at her, waiting for her to continue. "What happened?" She finally asked.</p>
		<p>"Terri," Noemí said, and swallowed hard. "And I, we uh-" She stopped and ran a hand through her hair. And then she let it all out in a rush. "I don't know what came over me last night, Vicki, I swear. I wanted her so much and I couldn't&#133;"</p>
		<p>When she finished, she saw that Victoria had been staring at her, astonished, eyes wide, mouth hanging open. Then she recovered, blinking rapidly and shaking her head. "Wow," She breathed, and then she smiled churlishly. "So," She said mischievously. "How was it?"</p>
		<p>Noemí slapped her across the shoulder, almost sending her off the seat. "It's not fucking funny, Victoria," She snapped, and stood up, pacing around the living room. "I don't know what to do, she slept with my brother and she's pregnant with his child-"</p>
		<p>Victoria snorted, standing up and slapping her thigh. "So fucking what?" She said, sounding angry. "Is he <i>here</i>, taking care of her, giving her the comfort that she needs? She's not his property just because she made the monumental mistake of sleeping with him, Noemí."</p>
		<p>Noemí stared at her, confused by her feelings. She said nothing.</p>
		<p>Victoria softened her tone. "How do you feel for her?" She asked gently, moving over to her and squeezing her shoulder.</p>
		<p>"I-" Noemí said with a shake of her head, frowning and staring down at the floor. "I don't know." She whispered in wonder. "It was like a dream, Vicki, it felt so good to touch her."</p>
		<p>Victoria chuckled softly, but didn't say more when she saw Terri trudging slowly down the hall from her bedroom. She had changed into shorts and a large T-shirt, which hugged her stomach tightly. Victoria went to her and kissed her cheek gently. "Merry Christmas, Terri." She said, and smiled, rubbing her huge stomach.</p>
		<p>"Merry Christmas to you too." Terri said to her with a sleepy smile and her eyes left her to find Noemí. She remembered the night perfectly, and turned towards the kitchen, hoping they didn't see her blush.</p>
		<p>Noemí's knees trembled, and she felt weak with desire. She saw the smile on Victoria's face, and turned away towards the window again. She felt her coming up behind her, hugging her from behind and kissing the back of her neck. "Vicki," She whispered, hugging Victoria's arms to her. "What am I going to do? What about Camilla?"</p>
		<p>"Hey, I'm only just learning about this relationship shit, I don't know what to tell you." Victoria said with a small laugh, resting her chin against her shoulder. "Are you and Camilla officially in a relationship?" She asked after a while.</p>
		<p>Noemí shook her head and sighed. "But she wants to be, I know she does. But I can't, I still love Amelia so much." She said.</p>
		<p>"You don't have to stop loving her to be in a relationship with someone else." Victoria said, and pressed her lips against Noemí's shoulder. "Amelia is dead, Noemí, when are you going to realize that?" She said, trying not to sound harsh.</p>
		<p>Noemí didn't reply, and stayed quiet for a long moment. "It doesn't mean I'm going to stop loving her." She said, her voice raspy with emotion as tears filled her eyes.</p>
		<p>Victoria tightened her arms around Noemí. "How do you feel for Camilla?" She asked softly. "Do you love her?"</p>
		<p>Noemí didn't hesitate and she shook her head. "I like her, and I'm very attracted to her, but I suspect that's as far as it'll get." She whispered.</p>
		<p>Victoria nodded, and they stared out at the bright snow in silence. "How do you feel for Terri?" She asked then. "Do you love <i>her</i>?"</p>
		<p>Noemí remained quiet for a long time. "I don't know." She said finally, thinking that every single time she looked at Terri, her heart skipped a beat, and all she wanted to do was hold her. She thought about last night; when she kissed Terri under the mistletoe, she had felt that her heart would beat right out of her chest. And about when Camilla had argued with her afterwards, having caught her doing such a reckless thing, and left right after that. But Noemí wanted to kiss Terri so bad, since she realized when her cousin Martha kissed her freshly on the mouth that there were little mistletoe branches hanging all over the house. She wanted to get her in a position where she could do just that, wrap her arms around her body and possess her. She watched her the whole night, waiting until Terri stood on the right spot. And when she got her, and was able to kiss her, she did not want to stop. She couldn't name her feelings, but they were strong.</p>
		<p>They went to the kitchen, and found Terri already eating slowly from a plate full of scrambled eggs and toast. She avoided Noemí's eyes, and didn't talk much amidst their conversations. Noemí didn't miss the look Michaela gave Victoria, and she knew that Terri told her about it too.</p>
		<p>Noemí couldn't stop looking at her, couldn't stop her eyes from lingering on the sensuous lips that were pressed against her own last night. It was as if her eyes were calling to Terri, because Terri lifted her eyes from the food and stared at her with wide eyes. Noemí found herself breathing hard, and her hands holding the fork and knife shook.</p>
		<p>She stood suddenly, unable to eat, and left the kitchen. In the living room, she sat down on the couch and brought her hands to her head. She closed her eyes and she swore she could feel Terri's plush body against her hands, her nipples hard against her tongue. "Oh, God," She breathed and started when a soft hand touched her shoulder. She looked up at Michaela, her face showing her frustration.</p>
		<p>Michaela sat in front of her on the coffee table, and smiled at her without saying anything. Noemí met her eyes and then looked away. "Well," Michaela said softly, and Noemí looked at her again. "Are you alright?"</p>
		<p>Noemí nodded slowly, and looked down at the floor. "Yes," She said softly. "I just feel guilty, I bought this house with Amelia, and I still love her so much. She haunts my dreams, my reality."</p>
		<p>Michaela nodded in understanding, and she reached over and ran gentle fingers through Noemí's soft drying hair. "Where you thinking of Amelia last night?" She asked.</p>
		<p>Looking up, Noemí shook her head, and said in a hoarse whisper: "That is why I feel guilty, she didn't even cross my mind when I was touching Terri. All I can think about right now is last night with Terri. And Camilla is pissed at me, because I kissed Terri last night. She shouldn't be, I mean, I guess she should-" She stood and paced around the living room in frustration, Michaela's eyes following her. "I don't know anything any more&#133; I need to go somewhere."</p>
		<p>Michaela chuckled softly, and leaned back, her hands holding her up against the table. "It would be kind of rude to leave your guests alone in the house, don't you think?" She pointed out.</p>
		<p>"Yes, yes, I'm sorry." Noemí said with an absent wave of her hand.</p>
		<p>Michaela stood and went to her, standing close to her and squeezing her arm comfortingly. "Do you want to be with her?" She asked.</p>
		<p>"With Camilla?" Noemí said, instantly knowing that Michaela meant Terri by the look she gave her. "You mean with Terri." Michaela nodded with a smile. "I- I don't know. She was with my brother, she slept with him."</p>
		<p>"Well, golly gee," Michaela said teasingly, placing a hand on the center of Noemí's chest and pushing gently. "Big fucking deal, you just slept with her too, in case you don't remember, and left her mighty confused too, to bat. Besides, what happened between your brother and she was not really a &#145;she slept with him' thing. Now you're acting like you're the one who doesn't know what you want."</p>
		<p>"I <i>don't</i>-"</p>
		<p>Michaela cut her off with a harsh question: "You know that last night was the first time she ever felt an orgasm?" Her eyes met Noemí's shocked eyes, and she smiled slowly.</p>
		<p>Noemí frowned, and looked away from her. "It was?" She asked softly, excitement flowing through her veins at the thought that she was the one who brought Terri to orgasm for the first time. She tried to hide it.</p>
		<p>Michaela snorted softly, seeing Noemí's excitement at the fact that she had brought Terri her first pleasure. "By now, we all know your brother didn't bother with her pleasure, Noemí," She said. "He cared only about his own, and Terri, for the first time in her life last night, felt something more than just a dick inside her, pardon my language. She never thought it would get better than what happened with Anthony, and she didn't like at all in the first place. You just happened to show her that it <i>does</i> get better." She looked at her for a long time, reading the mixed emotions playing on her face. "So now what are you going to do?"</p>
		<p>Noemí shook her head, looking like she was about to lose it. She pushed her fingers through her hair, sweat breaking out of her forehead. "It was her first?" She asked again, and looked at Michaela. "She's going to be so confused, because of me, Michaela. Have I hurt her?"</p>
		<p>Michaela shrugged. "Go and talk to her, I'll bring Victoria out of the kitchen." She said and turned away before stopping and looking at her. "Don't put your foot in it, that's all I ask you. Terri feels something deep for you, and Camilla knows it; that is why she argued with you last night after you kissed Terri." She turned away again, and emerged from the kitchen with a confused Victoria in tow.</p>
		<p>Terri remained behind, finishing the dishes. Noemí watched her from the door, her eyes moving down along her slender back and lingering at her shapely legs, swollen slightly by the pregnancy. "Terri," She whispered, and saw the small back stiffen, her hands stopping. She walked to her, and reached to touch her soft loose hair with tentative fingers. "Terri, I don't know what to do now," She whispered and moved closer, able to smell her natural strawberry scent and growing aroused again. "I don't want to hurt you."</p>
		<p>Terri spun around and looked up at her with glistening eyes. "Then don't touch me, please." She whispered, and gasped when Noemí pulled her into her arms despite her words. "Please, let me go, I can't take this-" Noemí's lips on her own cut her off, her tongue slipping through her lips and bringing forth a moan. Her arms wrapped slowly around Noemí's shoulders, her wet palms pressed flat against the wide plain of her upper back, leaving the imprint of her wet palms on her shirt. Noemí's lips caressed her cheeks, her neck, teeth sinking gently into flesh. "Noemí," Terri gasped, throwing her head back and moaning. "This is crazy, Noemí, please. We have to stop, it can't happen again. You and Camilla&#133; Ah!" Noemí's fingers were seeking underneath her shirt, moving up to tease her nipples to life.</p>
		<p>Her lips were back on her mouth, her tongue pushing through to touch hers. Their bodies melted together, Terri's protruding stomach pressing against Noemí's. "God, you're so sweet, Terri!" Noemí whispered intensely, her mouth working along her jaw, her hands beneath her shirt cupping her heavy breasts. "So beautiful, oh God." She gasped when the baby kicked, as if warning them that they were crushing it. She eased the pressure of her body against hers, but her lips never ceased their exploring. "I want to taste you again, Terri, I wanted to for so long."</p>
		<p>Terri felt helpless to her touch; she couldn't stop herself from responding to her hands and lips. She could feel the wetness between her legs growing. The bell rang, startling them away from each other; they stared at one another, as Victoria called out to Noemí in hidden warning. "Noemí, Camilla's here to see you."</p>
		<p>Terri pushed past Noemí and made her way to the living room. Noemí took a deep settling breath and followed after her. Camilla's smile grew as her eyes fell on Noemí. She carried a box in her hands and moved up to kiss her lips gently. "Hi, baby," She whispered, and pushed the box into her hands with a slow grin. "Your Christmas present."</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled at her, feeling sublimely guilty, because she could see in her eyes that Camilla loved her. "Thank you." She whispered and kissed her forehead softly. "Here, hold it, I'll get your presents so that we can open them together." She said to the rest of them. Terri was nowhere in sight. She found her in the bedroom, sitting on her bed staring at nothing, notepad in hand. "Come out, I'm giving out the presents." She said shyly.</p>
		<p>Terri shook her head slowly, not meeting her eyes. "Its okay, I don't feel very well." She said in a low voice. Concerned, Noemí moved to come into the room, but Terri lifted her hand to stop her. "No, please," She whispered. "Leave me alone, go with Camilla." She lay down and pulled the covers over her body. "Leave me alone." She repeated softly, sounding distant and sleepy.</p>
		<p>Noemí stared at the bundle on the bed for a long time, unsure of what to do. But Terri asked her to leave her alone and she would respect the fact that she wanted to be alone. She knew Terri's confusion was because of her inability to hold back her desire for her. She closed the door softly, and went into her office, where she stashed all the gifts. She came out to the living room, and handed them each her respective gift. She took back her gift from Camilla and they started to open their gifts together.</p>
		<p>Victoria smiled as she lifts out the blue original Donna Karen sweater. She blew a grateful kiss to Noemí. She had always been a fan of Donna Karen's style, so almost every piece of clothing she owned was a DKNY piece. "Beautiful. Your present is in my place, I didn't think of bringing it over."</p>
		<p>Noemí winked at her and looked at Michaela, who was engrossed in opening her gift-wrap carefully. "I didn't know what exactly your taste is, so I just got what I felt goes with you." She explained, and Michaela's smile grew as she lifted out a pretty Versace silk shirt. "Just because you've turned my best friend around." She said with a laugh. "She was so rude."</p>
		<p>"Hey!" Victoria complained good-humoredly. "I still am, I just have to watch my mouth in front of Miss Sergeant Cavanaugh, that's all." Michaela swatted her across the arm playfully.</p>
		<p>Camilla held up a pretty gold chain, smiling at Noemí softly. "Thank you, this is wonderful." She whispered and moved over to touch her lips to Noemí's, feeling her respond hesitantly. She pulled back, eyeing her closely, but Noemí's expression didn't give anything away. "Your turn to open your gift, honey." She said softly.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled and opened her box. A beautiful black designer shirt lay folded perfectly beneath the protective wrapping. She pulled it out and opened the shirt, then smiled at Camilla. "This is beautiful." She said and grinned as she showed Michaela and Victoria her present.</p>
		<p>Camilla chuckled, and said to Victoria and Michaela: "You wouldn't mind if I steal her for a few minutes, would you?"</p>
		<p>They both smiled and shook their heads, beginning to talk to each other when Camilla pulled Noemí down the hall and into her office. As soon as the door closed, Camilla pulled her into her arms, wrapping her arms around her neck, pulling her down for a deep sensuous kiss. She felt Noemí respond, but then she felt her grow hesitant and pulled back. She pulled away and looked up at her with question in her eyes. "What is wrong?" She asked, a tight fist of dread squeezing around her heart.</p>
		<p>Noemí avoided her eyes, and looked at something over her shoulder. "I'm sorry." She whispered softly, and shook her head as she met her eyes. "I did something that I shouldn't have done&#133;"</p>
		<p>Victoria jumped, startled out of her embrace with Michaela by the scream coming from Noemí's office. She stood up and looked cautiously down the hall. Camilla emerged from the office, yelling hysterically at Noemí, who followed her and tried to restrain her. She moved towards Terri's bedroom, and Noemí grabbed her by the arm and yanked her back towards the living room. "It has nothing to do with her!" Noemí said loudly. "Don't bring her into this!"</p>
		<p>"It has nothing to do with her?" Camilla repeated loudly, bewildered. Her face was red with anger. "That slut, she's had it for you, I knew it from the first time I saw her! She couldn't get your brother, so she wants to get you!" She waved her arms angrily.</p>
		<p>Noemí was slowly growing angry at her insults against Terri, but she held her anger down, knowing that she <i>was</i> at fault for Camilla's anger. "I thought I should tell you, I didn't want to lie to you, and I don't want you to be angry at Terri, it is not her fault. Only my fault-"</p>
		<p>"Not her fault!" Camilla yelled at her, fighting against tears. "Did she say no when you touched her, did she? She welcomed it, because she is a <i>whore</i>, I knew it the first time I looked at her that-" She cut off when Noemí charged at her, grasping her arms and shaking her angrily.</p>
		<p>Noemí's eyes flashed. "Don't talk <i>about</i> her like that!" She said through clenched teeth, scaring Camilla into staying quiet. "You don't know her to be saying those things!"</p>
		<p>"Hey, Noemí," Victoria said softly, placing a staying hand on Noemí's shoulder. "Let her go, let her <i>go</i>."</p>
		<p>Trembling, Noemí kept glaring at Camilla for a long time. Then with a deep shuddering breath, she let her go and turned away. She caught sight of Terri standing at the end of the hall, staring at them quietly. "Terri," She made a move to go down the hall, but Camilla pushed her aside and moved stiffly towards Terri, who only stood there staring at her with expressionless eyes.</p>
		<p>"You little bitch-" She said in a low voice, one hand clenching at her sides, the other lifting as if to slap her.</p>
		<p>Michaela suddenly appeared before her, between her and Terri. "Not one more step, Camilla." She said in a low, even voice, a hand on her shoulder. "In case you haven't noticed, she's pregnant."</p>
		<p>Camilla looked at Michaela through tearful eyes. "That hasn't stopped her from ruining my relationship with Noemí, has it?" She said bitterly, glaring at Terri over Michaela's shoulder. "You're a slut, Terri, you are; you know you are. You probably slept with her brother on purpose, so that you can claim something that is not yours. Their money-"</p>
		<p>"Shut up, shut up, <i>shut up</i>!" Noemí roared at her from the living room, charging towards her. Victoria held her back, speaking softly into her ear. "Tell her to shut up, Victoria, tell her to leave!" Noemí said, her voice lower. "I know it's my fault, Victoria, but what she's saying about Terri is not true. She should blame me, not her."</p>
		<p>Camilla turned away from Michaela, and walked towards the living room. She stood close to her and looked up into her eyes. "You're right, I <i>should</i> blame you." She whispered. "But you're both pieces of shit." She said, and slapped her hard across the face. She walked out.</p>
		<p>Noemí's eyes closed, and she crossed her arms over her chest. "Pretty." She muttered softly, her cheek stinging her hard. She opened her eyes, and looked down the hall at Terri, walking slowly towards her. Terri stared at her for a long time, seemingly paralyzed, and before Noemí could reach her, she slammed her bedroom door behind herself. "Terri, open the door!" Noemí called, knocking on the door. Terri didn't answer her. "Terri, are you okay? Please, let me know if you're okay." She tried and tried, and Terri ignored her. Finally, she gave up and rested her forehead and elbows against the door, hands on the back of her head.</p>
		<p>She felt a tentative hand on her shoulder. "Do you want us to stay?" Victoria asked softly, knowing how volatile Noemí's mood can be.</p>
		<p>Noemí nodded slowly, and turned to look at Victoria. Their eyes made contact for a long moment. "I need a shower." Noemí whispered softly, and walked into the bathroom.</p>
		<p>Victoria could tell she had been crying when she emerged from the bathroom, hair wet and dripping onto her face and shirt. Her eyes were red-rimmed, and she flopped down on the couch. Michaela had managed to get Terri to open the door for her, and now she sat in the room with her, trying to talk to her, leaving Victoria to talk to Noemí.</p>
		<p>Victoria sat beside her friend and wrapped an arm around her back. "What's up?" She said softly.</p>
		<p>"I don't know." Noemí answered, leaning forward, elbows against her knees. She stared off at space, her eyes turned downward in that hollow look Victoria had seen for so many years. "I don't know." She whispered again, biting her lower lip thoughtfully.</p>
		<p>Michaela sat beside Terri, a hand on her lower back soothing her, quietly waiting for her to speak. Terri's cheeks were wet with tears; her eyes were closed softly. "She's right." She said suddenly.</p>
		<p>Michaela frowned softly. "What?"</p>
		<p>"I am a slut." She whispered, and felt Michaela begin to protest. "I mean, who do I think I am, sleeping with a man, and then while pregnant with his child sleeping with his sister? Who do I think I <i>am</i>?" Her voice broke and she began to cry again for the umpteenth time, her head hanging, and her hands between her legs hanging limply.</p>
		<p>"Terri, relax, this won't do any good to your baby, please." Michaela said softly, and pressed a hand along her back, trying to calm the tension there. "Talk to Noemí, tell her how you feel for her."</p>
		<p>Terri shook her head and looked at her. "I can't&#133; I mean it, I can't." She whispered and Michaela shook her head to protest. "She still loves the ghost of Amelia, she's still crazy about her. I can't be like this!" She gasped, and more tears streamed down her face.</p>
		<p>Michaela crooned and held her gently, shaking her head and sighing.</p>
