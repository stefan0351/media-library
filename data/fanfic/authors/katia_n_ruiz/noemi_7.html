<!-- Noemí \ Chapter Seven -->

<p>Her interoffice line rang, and Noemí reached over for the receiver. "Hello," She said distractedly, kneading the bridge of her nose with her thumb and index fingers.</p>
		<p>"Noemí, Melanie is on line one for you." Her secretary said.</p>
		<p>With a soft smile, Noemí said: "Put her through."</p>
		<p>"Hi, Noemí." Melanie said, sounding glad to hear her voice. "How are you?"</p>
		<p>Leaning back on her seat, Noemí twirled her pen between her fingers. "I am fine, and yourself?" She replied.</p>
		<p>"Doing well," Melanie said, and sighed. She said nothing for a long moment, and Noemí could hear her breathing softly on the other end. "So when can we have dinner?" She now sounded a little nervous.</p>
		<p>Noemí thought about it. "Tonight after I get out of the office, if you like." She said, on an impulse.</p>
		<p>Melanie laughed delightedly. "Sounds like a great idea to me." She agreed, and they set a time and place to meet.</p>
		<p>Noemí leaned back on her chair, and spun around to stare out the windows at the blue sky, smiling as she thought about her younger days. Those days when everything was fun and uncomplicated, when death couldn't touch her or hurt her. Her smile faded as her memories returned to Amelia, the only woman that made her heart do a dance in her chest. She closed her eyes softly, and imagined that she could still feel Amelia's lips brush hers softly, hear her voice telling her she loved her. Feel her hands touching her arms and back reverently, their bodies dancing against one another as they made passionate love.</p>
		<p>The phone rang, and she started from her thoughts, spinning her chair to reach for the receiver again, welcoming the distraction.</p>
		<p>Noemí sat across from Melanie, looking like a commercial for fashion. Her work clothes had no wrinkles, her shirt had the top three buttons undone, and Melanie couldn't help but gaze at her with desire. Noemí had always had that effect on her; she had always made her feel this way, this breathless feeling of want and heat. She gazed at her as she talked about everything that had happened to her all those years since they last saw each other. "Tell me about you, Noemí. How are you?" She said, wanting to hear her voice.</p>
		<p>Noemí leaned forward, resting an arm on the table, and her smile faded a little. "I'd rather talk about you." She said evasively, looking down at the table.</p>
		<p>"You'd rather not talk about what's happened with you?" Melanie said softly, reaching over and touching the back of her hand with soft and slender fingers. "Why?" She knew why, but she wanted to hear Noemí's version of things.</p>
		<p>Noemí narrowed her eyes, and she looked down at Melanie's fingers touching her hand. "Come on, Melanie," She said softly, looking up to meet her eyes. "You know why, and I know that you know, things get around in our circle more than we'd like."</p>
		<p>Melanie smiled softly, brushing her hair from her forehead with her other hand. She'd heard about Noemí's accident from a lot of people, and about how her lover had died. She had shown up at the hospital every day during that first month when Noemí had been in a coma, and Victoria had been her contact. Once it was known that Noemí would recover, she had stopped going, not having the courage to face her, knowing that to Noemí it would make no difference whether she was there or not. "I know, Noemí." She said. "I just wanted to hear it from you."</p>
		<p>Noemí shrugged, shaking her head. "I'm not good at talking about it, I'm sorry." She said huskily.</p>
		<p>Melanie pulled her hand away, and smiled at her. "You don't have to then, unless you feel like you should. Remember that I'm always here no matter what." She reassured her.</p>
		<p>Noemí nodded and smiled, and everything felt all right again. Their food arrived and they began to eat. Noemí asked her about her family, and Melanie answered her eagerly, happy to have her close again. </p>
