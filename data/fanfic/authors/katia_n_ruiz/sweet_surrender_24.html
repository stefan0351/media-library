<!-- A Sweet Surrender \ Chapter Twenty-Three -->

<p>Jeffrey walked cautiously down the silent hallway in the middle of the morning, looking up and down the hall for any nurses, when he knew that no visitors would be in. He also didn't want to run into Ashleigh Simmons, that "dyke doctor," as he referred to her. He knew she hated him with a passion, and knew that at any opportunity, she'd destroy him with her Amazon strength. He found out Cassidy's room number by calling in and asking to be transferred to her room telephone. "Okay," The operator had said with an annoying nasal twang. "Room Three Forty."</p>
		<p>She'd picked up almost right away, and he recognized her voice, hanging up and deciding what he'd do with the information. He knocked, and her voice rang out from inside. "Come in."</p>
		<p>Opening the door slowly, he saw that she was sitting languidly on her bed, an open notepad on her lap, a poised ballpoint pen in her hand. Obviously, she'd been expecting Ashleigh or one of the nurses, because as soon as she laid eyes on him her smile faded and was replaced by a scowl. "What do you want?" She demanded coldly, putting the notepad and pen on the bed and standing up slowly.</p>
		<p>Jeffrey smirked and stood with his hands in his pockets. "So you're okay now." He stated the obvious with obvious wishes for it to be the opposite. "Weren't you dying? Or was that another ploy to take Andrea away from me?"</p>
		<p>The words stung. Cassidy narrowed her eyes angrily; a deep red flush covered her dark skin. "You are a bastard." She said in a low voice, trying to remain calm, knowing that if she was to get even better, she needed to relax. "I do not need any <i>ploy</i> to have Andrea. She loves me."</p>
		<p>"You know she's pregnant?" He asked, a triumphant smile covering his face. "Did she tell you she's pregnant with my child?"</p>
		<p>The disbelief showed on Cassidy's face before she could cover it up, regain her composure. "What are you talking about?" She said, holding her emotions under control. Inside, she was in turmoil, she didn't know what to think.</p>
		<p>Jeffrey rocked calmly in his feet. The truth was that he wanted to wrap his hands around her neck and break it. But he knew he'd be pointed as an instant suspect by her friends and would be found out. He did his best to control his urge, and said instead, seeking to hurt her in deeper ways: "Andrea and I have been planning to have a baby for months, didn't she tell you that? Why do you think she hasn't broken up with me? Had you thought that maybe she's just experimenting?" He walked towards the window and gazed out, poisoning Cassidy with his words. He turned to look at her, seemingly calm, though inside, he wanted to choke the life out of her. "I personally think every woman has to experiment at one time or another, and that's what Andrea's doing. </p>
		<p>"You see, I'm not jealous, because I know what she wants is this." He placed a hand over his endowment, grinning nastily as he massaged it slightly. "She comes home to me every night and rides this, right after she leaves here from seeing you and trying to make you feel better about yourself." He smiled with sarcastic sympathy. "She just feels sorry for you, Cassidy. As soon as you leave here, we marry."</p>
		<p>Cassidy gazed unemotionally at him, not wanting to give him the satisfaction of seeing that he'd hurt her. "Get out." She said in a calm monotone. "Go!" She was beginning to loose it, her brown eyes narrowing, her jaw clenching. She clenched her fists hard and tight, taking a step towards him, ready to break his face if he didn't leave.</p>
		<p>Jeffrey smiled at her, eyebrows arched and with his hands still in his pockets. Then he walked towards the door, and opened it slowly, glancing back at her one last time. "I'd appreciate it if you stay away from my <i>fiancé</i>." He pulled out a small box and opened it, reaching out with his hand and putting it to eye's view for Cassidy. Two diamond-encrusted rings, one slightly larger than the other, shone out from the small box. Cassidy's eyes remained emotionless, but Jeffrey could tell by the edge in her voice, the clenching of her jaw, that he had affected her. "You see, I already bought the rings. We're basically ready to tie the knot." He said pleasantly, and walked out.</p>
		<p>Cassidy closed her eyes tightly, struggling not to believe the information she'd just been given. She turned and clenched her fists, feeling tense and hot. She was trying to control her breathing, which was hard with the stress. She strode over to one of the vases of flowers and swept if off the table with one violent thrust. It shattered against the wall, water and flowers flying everywhere. A sob tore from her throat, and she swayed towards the bed.</p>
		<p>The violent sound had attracted the attention of the floor nurse, and she'd called Ashleigh over the line just before she'd left the desk to run to Cassidy's room. She eyed Jeffrey curiously as she passed by him; she'd seen him come out of Cassidy's room and had heard the sound a few seconds later. She found Cassidy lying on the bed, crying as she was straining to breathe. She touched her forehead, whispering soothing words and found that Cassidy's forehead was hot. Worriedly, she checked her temperature and found that it was high, at one hundred and two. She was baffled at the speed with which it rose. Just twenty minutes before, she'd checked and it had been normal.</p>
		<p>She applied the ever-ready oxygen mask that hung from the bed rail, ready for use in any emergency. At first, Cassidy fought against her, hands pushing away, but she gave in when Ashleigh walked in and ordered in that no-nonsense voice of hers to her to stay put. "What happened?" Ashleigh asked of the nurse when they'd put the extremely nervous Cassidy to bed. She had fallen into an exhausted sleep and Ashleigh had written into her clipboard, telling the nurse to retrieve a Tylenol anti-fever for Cassidy's fever.</p>
		<p>Upon making the half-unconscious Cassidy drink the tablets of Tylenol, the nurse explained. "She received a visit a few minutes ago," She said, she covered Cassidy gently and smoothed her hair. "And after he left, she got like this."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh's eyes snapped from Cassidy to the nurse. "He?" She demanded in a strained voice, her body and voice rigid. "What did he look like?" She was thinking that maybe it was Josua, or, she didn't know which was worst, Jeffrey.</p>
		<p>"Tall, handsome." The nurse said thoughtfully. "Nicely dressed, as if he were from GQ or something. Blue eyes, blonde. That's about all."</p>
		<p>But Ashleigh already knew who'd been there, and she was going to talk with Andrea about that as soon as she would get there.</p>
