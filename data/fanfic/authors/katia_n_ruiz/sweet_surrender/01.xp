	<chapter title="Prologue">
		<p>It was Valentine's Day. </p>
		<p>A day made for lovers, for best friends, for family; a day for everything that had to do with love. In the street, the knowledge of this day seemed to be so tangible. It seemed as if all the lovers of the world came out, walked about with their hands clasped together, their eyes locked to one another, everything locked together. Best friends allowed themselves the freedom to hold each other longer than usual. Hallmarks and other stores for lovers, friends and family, overflowed with customers. Stuffed animals, big and small, were practically sold out, cards too, distraction was evident on people's faces.</p>
		<p><i>If only best friends could also be lovers</i>, Cassidy Monsignor wished silently, sighing audibly. Her light golden brown eyes scanned the crowd with amusement, watching it as it turned almost rampant. <i>Last minute shoppers, </i>she reflected with a smile. The line to the cashier was long and slow, people were loosing their patience, audibly complaining. Cassidy looked down at the two stuffed animals she held. The soft white bear with the little red heart attached to its chest was for Andrea, her best friend, with whom she happened to be desperately in love. The other, a pink puppy, was for her "lover-of-the-month,"- as many people reflected of her dating habits- she smiled at the thought, Robie. She still had to get flowers and jewels for both of them.</p>
		<p>She reflected on this "lover of the month" business, frowning. It seemed to her that she didn't last with a woman long enough to start a relationship, much less to fall in love with. Either she'd grow tired of the woman, or the woman would assume that nothing would come out of her association with Cassidy. Robie hadn't been smart enough as of yet, but that was okay. She didn't push Cassidy for anything; she seemed to be on her own little agenda of single life, like Cassidy. Cassidy liked her, very much, but the attraction was purely sexual. Sex with Robie, whose name really was Robin, was immensely great, but there was no mind or heart bonding of any kind, like there was when someone was in love. When they weren't having sex, she and Robie would talk; they would tell each other things, getting to know one another.</p>
		<p> Cassidy was so deep into her thoughts that she didn't realize she'd reached the cashier. The young woman behind the counter smiled at her as she snapped her back to attention. She was attractive, long black hair picked back into a ponytail, brown eyes flirty and sensuous. Cassidy's eyes focused again, she apologized as she placed the little stuffed animals on the counter. The cashier woman, whose nametag said "Amistad", was methodically running the little price tags through the scanner with graceful hands. It was so obvious to Cassidy, and everyone who watched, that she was stalling, and shamelessly flirting. She sent little dimpled smiles in Cassidy's direction, attempted to make small talk. Cassidy was amused, and at the same time thoughtful. <i>Why can't Andy look at me like that?</i> She wondered almost childishly. <i>Hell, every other woman seems to!</i></p>
		<p>And that was true; it seemed that everywhere she went there were at least two women who hit on her, straight or lesbian. It was annoying at times, but some times she liked it, especially when she felt an attraction in return, when she couldn't help but want at least a little romp with them. Those moments went by quickly and satisfactorily; she knew how to avoid them afterwards, or how to manage it so that they didn't ask for anything more from her. Robie had been the one to approach her, with a little help from a mutual friend, pointing out that there would be no strings attached, that she was not looking for a serious relationship with anyone either.</p>
		<p>Andy wasn't like Cassidy, she was more a home person, and she liked being in a one on one relationship, believed in faithfulness and foreverness. She told Cassidy so, but never made a big deal of Cassidy's lifestyle, she was the sweetest woman in Cassidy's world, and no one could change that. It had been a little over a month since she'd last seen her and that made her conscience and heart cry out. She'd been the one avoiding seeing her, had been the one holding back.</p>
		<p>It was all because of Jeffrey.</p>
		<p>She felt a flash of fury at the thought of Jeffrey Rosenthal, Andrea's boyfriend. She didn't like him, and she knew he felt the same way about her. There was no love lost between them. She knew he was aware of her deep feelings for Andrea, knew that every time he kissed Andrea in front of her and smiled, he felt he was winning a battle.</p>
		<p>In the past year, ever since Andrea began her relationship with Jeffrey, Cassidy held back and had stopped calling so often, though she was always there every time Andy needed her.</p>
		<p>She paid the cashier without so much as a second glance, and left the store. She still had things to do before her double date that night. Doubles date that included Andrea and Jeffrey.</p>
		<p>Andrea Cates smiled to herself as she wrapped the gift slowly and neatly. It was important to her that Cassidy like it. She paused as she thought of her best friend. Her Cassidy, who'd always been there when she needed her, who was so sweet and loving. She knew Cassidy had been avoiding her, even though she'd always been there when she needed to. She would see her that night, as a matter of fact, after not having seen her in over a month. Occasional phone calls were all they would have; Cassidy was distant and Andrea wanted to know why.</p>
		<p>Every time she asked Cassidy if it was because she didn't love her anymore, like a child seeking approval, Cassidy would protest and convince her otherwise, but as soon as they were on safer ground, she would pull back again. Andrea would be hurt; Cassidy had <i>always</i> been there before.</p>
		<p>Andrea smiled as she remembered happier moments with Cassidy. They'd grown up together, their families being so-so close friends. Andrea came from a loving Caucasian family, a family that welcomed Cassidy, even though she seemed to be different. They were a family that was close, two older brothers and a little sister, that being Andrea. They all had hearts too big for their bodies, and everyone loved them. Cassidy's family was completely the opposite. Cold parents and no siblings had caused Cassidy to grow up cold and almost unyielding.</p>
		<p>Andrea always managed to break her ice, she never wondered how. But she knew that having made sure that Cassidy visited her everyday, that her unyielding parents allowed her to come over, had made a small place in Cassidy's hard heart to be warm. And that was what made them best friends. Andrea was the one who kept their friendship alive, practically since they'd been born. They went to school together, took all kinds of courses just so they could be together. They rode bike together after school, learned how to roller-skate together, and told their deepest secrets to one another. So when Cassidy told her of her sexuality, Andrea took it without question and accepted her the way she was. She accepted her girlfriends, and made sure <i>her</i> boyfriends weren't bigots and made sure they went on double dates together.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's family turned their backs on her and disowned her without a thought. Cassidy had attempted suicide, and her parents didn't care. Andrea was all Cassidy had. Andrea helped her out; her parents were helpful also, providing a roof for Cassidy. Cassidy won a scholarship for her writing ability, and was lucky to have been accepted into one of the best schools for journalism there was. Andrea had been there all the time, had comforted her when she cried disconsolately, had helped her with money whenever she needed it. Cassidy always told her she wouldn't be where she was now if it weren't for her.</p>
		<p>Andrea knew that was definitely the truth.</p>
		<p>Cassidy was successful as a writer; her books were all over the bookstores, bought non-stop by fans. She also wrote lesbian fiction, and had a vigorous following of old and young lesbians. Andrea, though she didn't consider herself a lesbian, had read all of her books and articles, and loved them. Cassidy also wrote for a newspaper and was very recognized for her journalism skills.</p>
		<p>Andrea snapped back from her thoughts of Cassidy and realized she hadn't moved a finger. She glanced at the clock hanging from the wall. FIVE THIRTY!</p>
		<p>She had to start getting ready.</p>
		<p>Her hands began to work on the gift again.</p>
		<p>Robie Stanfield opened the door to find Cassidy there. She felt a shiver run through her body as Cassidy smiled her sensuous half smile. Robie's brown eyes ran the length of her lithe body, liking what she saw. Cassidy's dark hair was long and wavy, flowing thickly down her back and over her wide shoulders. She wore dark blue slacks that were snug around her thin waist and a peach colored sleeveless V-neck sweater, nothing underneath it. Her skin was bronze and flawless, her neck long and graceful. Robie finally looked up at her face, a face that left her sighing, so beautiful it was.</p>
		<p>Robie finally invited her in, unaware of the things Cassidy held in her hands. "Robie," Cassidy said with a husky voice, as she pushed the door closed. Robie turned around to face her and Cassidy stepped up close to her. Robie closed her eyes; she could smell the delicious scent of Cassidy's Dolce &amp; Gobbana cologne. "Happy Valentine's day." Cassidy said softly, her Portuguese accent thick, and pressed her soft thick lips to hers. She knew the effect she had on women, and she relished it. She pulled back and handed her the pink roses and stuffed pink puppy, along with a gift-wrapped box. "You're ready, I see." She whispered huskily, looking Robie over.</p>
		<p>Her golden eyes ran the length of Robie's body, slowly and sensuously. Her eyes danced. Robie could feel her intense eyes on her; she shivered. She wore a red silk dress that reached down to her knees; her shapely legs were bare. She wore red high heels, but she was still shorter than Cassidy's five-foot-nine frame. She attempted to concentrate on her gifts from Cassidy, which included a gift-wrapped box of DKNY perfume, but she was painfully aware of Cassidy's eyes on her body. She felt so lucky, that a woman as gorgeous as Cassidy should waste her time with her was a mystery. Though Robie was very attractive, she felt that she was nothing compared to someone like Andrea or Cassidy.</p>
		<p>"Do we go?" She asked, her voice breathy, her body trembling with desire. Cassidy was looking at her with such heat in her eyes, she felt as if she were being touched by it.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled softly, a jolt of sexual energy radiating through her. "Where's my gift?" She asked hoarsely.</p>
		<p>"How could I have forgotten?" Robie exclaimed as she hurriedly left the living room and came back with a small velvet box in her hand.</p>
		<p>Cassidy took it and kissed her again, lingeringly on the lips. She opened the little box and smiled at what was inside. A gold plate, with "Cassidy" spelled out with diamonds. It came with a medium-thick gold chain. Cassidy lifted it out of the little box and looked at Robie with smiling eyes. "Put in on me, I love it." She said gently.</p>
		<p>Robie stood very close as she clasped the chain behind her neck, then she let it drop, rested her arms on her shoulders. "Tonight," She promised softly. "I'll give you an even better present."</p>
		<p>Cassidy threw back her head and laughed, revealing a set of beautifully straight and even white teeth. "I'm sure you will." She said softly.</p>
		<p>Jeffrey kept the smile on his handsome face as Andrea stared at her gift with a surprised smile. The little gold plate with her whole name inscribed into it was beautiful. She smiled at him, a genuine sincere smile. <i>She's so beautiful!</i> He thought as he kissed her softly. She had the kind of hair that was always made people want to touch it and run their fingers through it. It was soft and curly; dark, people said black. Her sweet smile made people smile also, made people unwittingly fall in love with her.</p>
		<p>She was small, seemingly delicate, she made people want to take care of her, and she could pass for someone of the age of sixteen. Her eyes were blue, like the sky. She had a beautiful oval-shaped face, her nose was thin and straight, her lips were soft and glistening invitingly. But the truth was that she was as independent as a person could be, took care of herself, lived on her own and liked it. She taught tenth grade English at a high school, was loved by all of her students.</p>
		<p>But there was one exception to her rule of independence, one exception Jeffrey hated, and that was Cassidy Monsignor.</p>
		<p>Every time Andrea was having a hard time about something, the first person she'd call would be Cassidy. God, how he hated her! And he couldn't say anything at all to Andrea, because he knew he'd loose her. He was so glad Cassidy disliked him enough to strain and pull back on her friendship with Andrea. And that surprised him, because she was so in love with her that she couldn't hide it. But soon, he'd make the move to take her completely away from Cassidy, the move he knew would destroy Cassidy completely and make her pull away forever, and that would be to ask Andrea to marry him.</p>
		<p>He would win the war, a war Cassidy wasn't even trying to win. Jeffrey smiled smugly to himself as he helped Andrea into her jacket.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter One">
		<p>"We made reservations for four." Jeffrey said, with an air of self-importance, his arm around Andrea's shoulders protective.</p>
		<p>The old matron's eyes were trapped on Andrea, his smile foolish, revealing a set of teeth too white and clean to be real. Only Jeffrey would notice that. "Your name, sir?" He asked with a thick French accent, his old wrinkled hands nervously twisting his pen around.</p>
		<p>"Jeffrey Rosenthal." Jeffrey replied, proud of Andrea's effect on people.</p>
		<p>The matron was reluctant to move his eyes away from Andrea, as if she would disappear as soon as he looked away, like a mirage. He found the name and walked them into the restaurant's non-smoking area. Andrea looked around at the decorations and was awed. The place was beautiful and tasty; everything seemed to be made of wood, beautiful shiny wood. The tables were spaciously set apart to give the waiters the perfect space to walk through without bothering the clients. There was a small dance floor; the band would play tastefully soft music.</p>
		<p>The matron pulled the chair at the table for Andrea, smiling at her gracious thank you. "I am at your service." He retorted. <i>My, this guy's completely smitten!</i> Jeffrey thought with amusement. "Would you like anything to drink while you wait for the rest of your party?" He asked eagerly.</p>
		<p>"Don Perignon." Jeffrey said, dismissing him with a look.</p>
		<p>The Don Perignon arrived shoved delicately into a silvery bucket full of ice a few minutes later. The waiter brought four glasses, filled two and left them. Not long after, the old matron brought in Cassidy and Robie. Jeffrey didn't fail to notice the way Andrea's face lit up at the sight of Cassidy, and neither did Robie. Jeffrey poured Don Perignon for Robie and Cassidy, remaining civilized as he returned Cassidy's unsmiling greeting. He flinched when Andrea threw her arms around Cassidy and held her tightly.</p>
		<p>Robie smiled at Jeffrey, aware of the jealousy seething from him. She knew of Cassidy's feelings for Andrea, but she didn't drive herself crazy like Jeffrey seemed to do. One reason being that she never fell out of love with her previous lover, who was gone on some type of project for the museum for which she was an archeologist. From time to time, her ex-lover would write her, sweet promising letters, proving she hadn't fallen out of love either. She hadn't told Cassidy of this yet, but planned to tell her soon.</p>
		<p>"Robie," Cassidy said over Andrea's shoulder. "You remember Jeffrey." She flipped a hand between them.</p>
		<p>Jeffrey smiled at her sincerely and took her small hand into his larger one. "I do remember," He said, his smile turned flirty. "It is a pleasure seeing you again."</p>
		<p><i>This guy is so full of himself!</i> Robie thought with amusement. Her opinion of him hadn't changed since she met him a little over a month before at a party both Andrea and Cassidy had been invited to. Andrea finally let Cassidy go, and they sat down. Their assigned waiter brought their menus. Cassidy didn't look at the menu, and ordered a tasteful dinner based on seafood; she was a vegetarian. After a while, they ordered.</p>
		<p>Andrea was ecstatic, immensely happy to see Cassidy again. "Cassidy," She said breathlessly, taking her hand. "I'm so happy to finally see you!" Her voice broke with emotion, her eyes filled with tears.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled tenderly, and gently wiped the tears from her cheeks with her thumbs, pressing her palms to her cheeks. "I am too." She whispered the love in her eyes and voice unmistakable; only Andy couldn't see it. She brightened suddenly, and turned to Robie. "Let me get it, Robie." She said eagerly, giving her a grateful smile. She lifted the little stuffed bear and gift box from Robie's hand and handed it to Andrea, whose beautiful face was glowing with feeling. Cassidy said: "Happy Valentine's day."</p>
		<p>Andrea's smile full and wide, her eyes twinkling. <i>God, no wonder Cassidy fell in love with her!</i> Robie thought. <i>I would too, if it weren't for Isabelle.</i> Andrea's arms were around Cassidy's neck again; she was laughing with delight. "Thank you," She said shakily, unable to hold back her emotions. She smelled the stuffed bear and smiled at Jeffrey. Her grinning eyes returned to Cassidy's. "It smells like you, Cassidy." She whispered.</p>
		<p><i>I could swear Andrea's in love with Cassidy too.</i> Robie thought to herself, smiling. Her eyes went to Jeffrey, and her smile faded. <i>But then what is she doing with this pompous asshole?</i> She watched Andrea open the gift box and beam proudly as she stared the beautiful bracelet inside. The food arrived, and they spoke while they ate. Jeffrey made sure he kissed Andrea from time to time, smiling smugly at Cassidy behind her back. Andrea asked Cassidy and Robie how things were with them, about their jobs, about everything she could find to ask about. She was unaware of the way Jeffrey leered at Cassidy, and when Cassidy became pensively quiet, she didn't know why either.</p>
		<p>The band began to play at nine o'clock, soft beautiful music Cassidy recognized from her childhood. She asked Robie for a dance, excusing herself from the table. She guided Robie through the slow rhythm, her hand on her hip holding her close to herself. Robie wrapped her arms around Cassidy's neck and rested her head on her shoulder, pressing her face against the smooth neck. "Andrea must be very na&amp;iuml;ve." She commented, trying to sound casual.</p>
		<p>Cassidy frowned, pulling back to look at her face. "Why do you say that?" She asked.</p>
		<p>Robie laughed, and looked directly into her eyes. "Because she doesn't realize how much in love with her you really are." She said, and felt Cassidy stiffen against her. Cassidy never told her of her feelings for Andrea. "And because she's with that asshole."</p>
		<p>Cassidy didn't respond and skillfully guided her throughout the song, never missing a beat. Andrea watched them with a dreamy smile on her face; she planned on asking Cassidy to dance with her afterwards. Jeffrey held her hand, but didn't ask her to dance; he wasn't one to dance. There were a lot of things he wasn't into that Andrea liked, some called him uptight, and he called himself "too good for trivialities."</p>
		<p>Robie and Cassidy returned to the table after a couple of songs, and as one of Andrea's favorite songs was starting, she asked Cassidy to dance with her. Cassidy looked at Robie, who smiled and shrugged in consent, and at Jeffrey, who glared at her with deep hate and jealousy. Before Cassidy could set her to what she felt would be a safe position between them, Andrea drew close and wrapped her arms around her neck. Cassidy reluctantly wrapped her own arms around Andrea's small waist, taking a deep breath as Andrea pushed herself closer to her.</p>
		<p>The band played the slow ballad, Chicago's "If you leave me now," a well known love song. Andrea felt a sense of peace in Cassidy's strong arms, her body felt warm close to hers; she felt complete after that whole month of not seeing Cassidy. Her eyes filled with tears again and she looked up at her. Their faces were close together and she could feel Cassidy's sweet breath against her lips. "Why did you leave like that?" She asked suddenly, her voice thick with tears, not realizing the magnitude of her hurt. "What did I do to you, Cassidy?" Cassidy's eyes widened as the tears spilled from Andrea's eyes. "You've been different the past year, why?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy was speechless, she didn't know she'd hurt Andrea to that extent. "Oh, Andy," She sighed, feeling her own tears wet her cheeks. "It's not you, babe. Trust me, it's not you." Her voice shook. "I'm sorry I've been so distant." She tightened her grip on Andy and rocked her gently. She pressed her lips against her forehead and closed her eyes with the emotion in her heart being almost unbearable; she held her for a long time, until their tears subsided.</p>
		<p>They were unaware of Jeffrey's cold blue eyed glare, of his anger practically burning Robie with its radiation.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Two">
		<p>Robie walked into her apartment with Cassidy in tow. She continued into her living room, turned on the lamp and stopped. Cassidy stood behind her, wrapping her arms slowly around her waist. Robie shivered as she felt Cassidy's lips softly caress the back of her neck. "It's true, what you said." She whispered huskily, and moaned as she felt the wet warmth of Cassidy's tongue on her skin.</p>
		<p>"What did I say?" Cassidy whispered, pulling Robie tighter against her hips, kissing her shoulders lightly, running her tongue softly over the skin.</p>
		<p>Robie gasped, pushing her hips backward to meet hers, her back arching. "Jeffrey <i>does</i> hate you." She reached back to grab Cassidy's hips and pulled them forward. "He's insecure because he knows Andrea's not in love with him, but with you... She just doesn't know it yet."</p>
		<p>She felt Cassidy pause in her exploration. Her arms loosened around her. "You're talking nonsense." She said, and pulled away from her. "Andrea is straight."</p>
		<p>Robie turned to gaze at her, laughing softly. "You are as na&amp;iuml;ve as Andrea then, Cassidy. You're so blind with love for her that you can't even see the magnitude of her love for you. Shit, she can't even see it herself!" She said, laughing again.</p>
		<p>Cassidy wouldn't allow herself to be hopeful; she didn't want to be hurt. "Andrea is straight." She argued stubbornly.</p>
		<p>"Okay." Robie shrugged, she wasn't about to argue. Her body quivered with desire as she studied Cassidy from head to toe. "Come here, baby. I want you to make love to me..." She whispered huskily, opening her arms in invitation.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled, grateful for Robie's sudden change of subject. She walked into her arms and pressed her lips against her, her silky tongue dancing into Robie's mouth and making gentle contact. She shuddered as Robie's hands traveled down the length of her lean back and cupped her hard buttocks. She pulled her mouth away from Robie's to gasp for air; her body was trembling with the heat of Robie's hands and lips. She looked into Robie's eyes as she whispered: "I want you! Right here, on the floor, completely naked!"</p>
		<p>Robie felt her legs weaken; she wasn't sure how, but she ended up on her back, Cassidy's hard body on top of her, pressing against her and expertly bringing her close to orgasm before they even got their clothes off.</p>
		<p>Andrea shivered violently as Jeffrey entered her. He was slow with her, gentle. He groaned as he pushed deeper into her, as he felt her warmth completely envelop him. "Oh, Andy, I love you!" He gasped as he began a slow rhythm with his hips. He felt her wrap her legs around his waist, her small arms around his neck.</p>
		<p>Andrea felt the rhythm inside her, but for some reason, she wouldn't, <i>could not</i>, respond to him the way she thought she should. Only a small flicker of pleasure pulsed through her. Not enough to make her orgasm, no man had ever brought her to that. It wasn't that Jeffrey was a bad lover, she'd had her share of them, and Jeffrey didn't fit into that category. He was the gentlest and most thoughtful. Orgasm was a stranger to her; the closest she thought she'd gone was when she dared to touch herself.</p>
		<p>Her distracted mind strayed to Cassidy, her beloved Cassidy. <i>My beautiful best friend, whom I love and who loves me.</i> She closed her eyes when she felt Jeffrey increasing the speed of his rhythm.</p>
		<p>With her eyes closed, her mind produced an image of Cassidy, with her tender smiles, so beautiful and sweet. And then she remembered the way Cassidy held her when they danced, the feel of her silky lips against the skin of her forehead. A flash of heat went through her body, and she arched under Jeffrey. The image she'd conjured had been innocent and sweet; she didn't understand why her body reacted in that manner. But then unwittingly, her mind conjured an image of herself and Cassidy, dancing, holding each other the way they did at the restaurant. Only in this image, Cassidy didn't kiss her forehead; she kissed her lips, sweetly and passionately.</p>
		<p>Another jolt shook her, and before she knew it, she was clenching tightly around Jeffrey, experiencing an orgasm. Her cry startled Jeffrey, who'd never heard her cry out in that manner. He had finished along with her, and remained on top of her, asking if she was okay. "Yes, please get off me, please, Jeffrey!" She begged, out of breath, feeling the confusion burn through her. She'd never done that before, thought of Cassidy while she was in bed with any other man. <i>And look at what just happened</i>, she reproached herself, <i>I came my heart out. Came like I never did before. With just a thought of Cassidy...</i></p>
		<p>"I'm going out of state in a couple of weeks, Andy." Jeffrey said into Andrea's hair. He lay on his back and she lay half of her body in his arms. She played with the hairs on his wide chest, her small fingers twirling the curls around.</p>
		<p>She lifted her head to look at him. "Where?" She asked.</p>
		<p>"Massachusetts." He replied, kissing the top of her head. "Just for a couple of weeks, some business work." Jeffrey was a business partner at a prosperous travel agency. From time to time, he would go away a week or more to travel agents conventions at resorts and lodges. So Andrea didn't find it strange. "There's a new resort that sounds good for business. Agents from all over the country were invited to see it and try it out for a couple of weeks."</p>
		<p>Andrea smiled. "That's great!" She said, kissing him lightly on his chin.</p>
		<p>"I wish you could come with me." He said, tightening his muscled arms around her.</p>
		<p>"I have a job, Jeffy. Plus, it's a business trip." Andrea said, but she really didn't want to go with him. "Now, go to sleep." She ordered softly, patting his chest softly, closing her eyes and burrowing deeper into his embrace.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Three">
		<p>"Ms. Cates, I don't see why we have to write this essay on Adolph Hitler." Roseanne Mitchell was saying in her lovely voice two Mondays later; she was one of Andrea's all time favorite students. Her bright red hair bobbed up and down as she spoke. "Mrs. Morello could have given us someone better, like... Franklin D. Roosevelt!" Her blue eyes lit up. "There's one guy who deserves a little praise." She continued before Andrea got a word of response in; she opened her mouth again to reply. But Roseanne rambled on: "I mean, to be sick enough to be crippled and still have the strength to run a country, much less a war..."</p>
		<p>Roseanne was a lively Irish-American fifteen-year-old descendant whose thin mouth ran more than her feet. She was short and thick, more like bubbly, and plain and simply adorable. Andrea, in her five years of teaching, had never met a student who had as many friends as Roseanne did. She was a great student, and got excellent grades, which also made her a favorite among teachers.</p>
		<p>"Why don't you speak to her about it?" Andrea asked her when she finally quieted down. They were sitting in the small office Andrea shared with another English teacher. Every day, on Roseanne's free period, which would also be one of Andrea's, they would sit in the smallish office and have interesting conversations.</p>
		<p>A sound like a squeal came out of Roseanne's mouth. Her eyes widened so much that her blue irises were completely visible. "Are you crazy?" She exclaimed, her voice raised an octave. "I'm complaining, yeah. But that's just between you and me, Ms. Cates." Her facial expression changed to that of secrecy. "You know I'll do the stupid essay anyway."</p>
		<p>Andrea laughed; Roseanne made her laugh too much. "Oh, Roseanne. No wonder every body loves you." She said breathlessly between her laughter. "You're adorable."</p>
		<p>Roseanne brightened even more. "I must remind you of yourself, then." She replied, her cheeks flushing. "Everybody loves you too. When you're not around, the students just go on and on about you. All the boys are in love with you," He hesitant. "Even the gay boys and girls."</p>
		<p>Andrea laughed again; her stomach was beginning to hurt. "How's your mother, Roseanne?" She asked, changing the subject.</p>
		<p>"She's fine." Roseanne answered, smiling. Andrea had met Carey Mitchell at a parent-teacher conference and the two women had taken to each other. Carey was a short butch who was definitely not in the closet. She'd gotten pregnant with Roseanne when she spent the night with a gay man, who was her best friend. For as long as they'd known each other, Carey and Roseanne's father wanted to have a child together. And they did, raising the child with love and an open-mindedness that paid them well. But really, the biggest reason for Andrea's fondness for Carey was that she reminded her of Cassidy, with her aggressive demeanor and courteous attitude. "She says hello."</p>
		<p>"Same from me." Andrea said, glancing at her watch. "Tell her I'll call her about dinner soon. Now, the bell's about to ring. You better get ready." She advised. She watched Roseanne pick up her things from the small student desk by the corner and shove them into her backpack. "See you in class."</p>
		<p>Roseanne walked to the door, turned around and said: "See you in class." Then walked out and closed the door behind herself.</p>
		<p>Andrea sat back on her chair and sighed dreamily, her thoughts straying to Cassidy, as they seemed to be going more and more. She wondered what she was doing at that exact moment.</p>
		<p>Cassidy leaned forward in her seat, switched on her computer, and waited for its program to load. She watched solemnly as the usual information scrolled through the dark screen. She stood up and went to her kitchen, -rolling her wide muscular shoulders- a large and stylish piece of work. The cabinets were made of oak, shiny and spacious. The refrigerator was a large Westinghouse double door, which produced ice and water out of a built in hole on the freezer door. The oven, along with the microwave, was also Westinghouse, and was custom-built into the wall and ran off electricity.</p>
		<p>Cassidy opened the refrigerator and peered inside, looking for something to snack on. She worked out of her office at home from time to time, not finding it really necessary to be at the main building every day. Still, she had an office waiting for her. Her computer at home was linked to the ones at work, and whenever she needed information to work for an article all she had to do was call and link with the computer through the telephone lines with a code.</p>
		<p>Her editor, Joel Michaels, the chief editor of New Carter News, was a short plump man in his thirties with penetrating brown eyes and blonde hair. He was generally nice, but could be a pain in the ass when it suited him. Cassidy was awaiting email from him, feedback on the latest article she'd written. She'd left her assignment on human rights on his desk the previous Friday, along with a note letting him know she'd remain home that Monday, to email her with his comments. When he presented her with that assignment, she'd been glad. She'd gotten in touch with old flames or friends who were known activists in the gay, lesbian, black, and other organizations. Some were leaders, while others just helped or supported.</p>
		<p>What she basically did was go around visiting some of them at these organizations, asking for numbers on statistics and opinions on today's youth on the rising of the AIDS epidemic, and the American government's almost non-existent help. After she received what she needed, she began to write her first draft, reviewed it, and finished her second draft easily. That was the one she'd sent Joel.</p>
		<p>Finally, she found something to her liking. A frozen yogurt. She sat down on her black plush-leather couch. She sighed, feeling it mold to her body, holding the teaspoon and cup on each hand. She ate the yogurt slowly, her mind fading, conjuring thoughts of Andy. Cassidy missed her already. She'd last seen her three days before, on Friday night, with Jeffrey at her shoulder, keeping eye on her every movement. She wondered when there would be a time when he wouldn't be present, building a wall between them.</p>
		<p>Cassidy couldn't help but dislike him; she never disliked any of Andrea's previous boyfriends; as much as they knew the deep nature of her love for Andrea, they never tried to separate them. Andrea would never have allowed it. But Jeffrey, Cassidy grimaced at the thought of him, Jeffrey hated her with an unnatural passion. He was trying to do everything possible to separate them, and Cassidy knew it. She knew she wasn't fighting, but then again, she was never one to fight. If she would have been a fighter, if she had fought against Jeffrey for herself, she knew Andy would have at least been aware of her feelings. If she had been a fighter, she knew she wouldn't have tried to commit suicide that long ago day when her family turned their backs on her.</p>
		<p>She still had the marks on her wrists to prove it, and still, at times, she felt like reopening those wounds. Cassidy remembered it as if it were yesterday. She was fifteen then, and had gone to her mother, sat down in front of her between her and the TV. Mrs. Martica Monsignor had been, and still probably still was, Cassidy didn't know, a television addict. Nothing, except her husband and the kitchen, could get her off the couch and her knitting. So when a young Cassidy sat in front of her, trying to get her attention, Mrs. Monsignor ignored her, looking over her shoulder at the old General Electric television. "Mom," Cassidy had said softly, shyly, struggling against her resolve. "I need to talk to you."</p>
		<p>Mrs. Monsignor stared at her daughter as if she were a pest. "What?" She demanded in cold exasperation. "What is it?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy cringed at the cold tone of her mother's voice. "Mom," She was always an intelligent speaker. "You have to be objective. You have to listen to me, don't shut me out, please."</p>
		<p>Mrs. Monsignor stared at her daughter, whom she didn't feel deep in her heart, with annoyance. "Will you say it already," She exclaimed, her accent thick. "I'm missing the Ed Sullivan show!"</p>
		<p>Cassidy had taken a deep breath and blurted it all out. About her feelings for other females, of her desires. Of everything that was in her heart, with just a little hope that her mother would understand and love her anyway.</p>
		<p>Her mother stared at her blankly, and then, with a horrifying look of disgust, unleashed a hard slap to young Cassidy's face. Cassidy fell off the coffee table, feeling the stinging spot where her mother's ragged hand had landed. "Don't talk that crap in my house!" Mrs. Monsignor had shrieked, stomping over to where her daughter lay shocked. Her kick to the stomach sent the air from the vulnerable Cassidy. "You're not my daughter," She hissed vehemently. "And wait until Carlos comes home."</p>
		<p>Cassidy ran to her room, where she lay in a state of hysteria, trembling violently. She knew her father wouldn't be so nice. About two hours later, the sound of her father's steps through the house, her mother's low and angry voice, and then the heavy sound of his angry steps coming up the stairs, sent her into a sobbing fit. The severe beating she received still didn't absolve her from going to school the next day.</p>
		<p>Bruised and aching, her heart completely numb, a sharp blade inside her pocket, she left the house the next morning to school. Andy had been waiting for her outside the school at their usual spot. And when Cassidy didn't stop to greet her and talk to her, but sped by instead, she knew something was terribly wrong. She called out her name, then merely followed when Cassidy didn't answer her. Cassidy went into an empty bathroom and when Andrea walked in a few seconds later, she found her standing and staring expressionless at a quickly growing pool of blood at her feet.</p>
		<p>Her wrists were cut open, she was paling very quickly, and her legs wavered. There seemed to be so much blood. Andrea had screamed for help and ran to her best friend's side. When Cassidy crumpled in her arms, getting blood all over her, her face unnaturally pale, her eyes crossing before they fluttered closed, she knew Cassidy was the most important thing in her life. She never ceased letting Cassidy know that.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's heart skipped a beat at the thought of being in Andrea's arms. She closed her eyes, feeling in her body a rush of intense heat. She would make passionate love to her, make her know with her body what she couldn't describe with words. The jarring sound of the phone startled her out of her thoughts. She picked up on the second ring. "Hello?" She said hoarsely.</p>
		<p>"Cassidy," It was Andy, her soft voice sending a chill through Cassidy's spine. And then needlessly, she said: "It's Andy."</p>
		<p>Cassidy would recognize that beautiful voice anywhere; she closed her eyes to the sound of the velvet voice on the other side of the line. "Hi, Andy." She whispered hoarsely. "I recognized your voice."</p>
		<p>"Are you okay, Cassidy?" Andy asked, worry in her voice. "Are you getting a cold?"</p>
		<p><i>God, she's so innocent!</i> Cassidy thought with a deep swelling of her heart. <i>How could I ever corrupt her like that?</i> "I'm fine, Andy." She said after clearing her throat. "I was resting a little, that's all. How are you?"</p>
		<p>Andy smiled. "I'm okay, Cassidy." She paused, hesitating. "I missed you."</p>
		<p>Cassidy's heart quickened, and she berated herself: You're<i> her best friend, of course she misses you!</i>' She shook her head. <i>Stop this, Dammit! She's innocent!</i> "I've missed you too, Andy." She said in a low voice.</p>
		<p>Andy closed her eyes, feeling her throat constrict. "Have dinner with me, Cassidy." She said impulsively. "It's been a long time. Just you and me." She continued, placating.</p>
		<p>"What about Jeffrey?" Cassidy asked, despite herself.</p>
		<p>"He'll be at a dinner meeting, Cassidy." Andrea replied firmly, letting her know with her tone of voice that it didn't matter whether he was in a meeting or not. She wanted to have dinner with her, and that was it. She said: "And even if he weren't, I'd still go to dinner with you." She paused. "So, will you have dinner with me?" She asked again.</p>
		<p>Cassidy couldn't say no, she wanted so much to look into her Andy's sky blue eyes and feel as if she were staring at the sky itself. She wanted to feel her love, even if it wasn't the same woman-to-woman love she felt for her. "Okay," She said softly. "Where do you want to meet?"</p>
		<p>Andy let out a long held breath, she was so sure Cassidy would decline. "Great!" She exclaimed. "Come and pick me up. We'll go to a nice, comfortable place. No need to dress up."</p>
		<p>"Okay, at eight?" Cassidy asked, feeling nice. Very nice.</p>
		<p>"Eight it is." Andy said lightly, then: "I love you." And hung up.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled to herself, feeling her heart was about to beat out of her chest. She took a deep breath, and realized the yogurt lay forgotten on the white coffee table in front of her. She shook her head; she wasn't hungry any more. She stood up, deciding to make a visit to a dear old friend.</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Four">
		<p>Ashleigh Simmons was a very active member in the war against AIDS. A medical doctor and blood specialist for twenty plus years, she had become especially interested in the cause when her younger brother died of the horrid disease. An austere, though highly attractive woman in her forties, she held ground in her field of work. Her short graying hair and flashing green eyes gave her an air of sophistication that preceded her wherever she showed her presence. Articulate in speech, she was highly educated and her social status remained unperturbed despite the openness of her sexuality. Very tall and built, she was healthy in every extent. She was in great shape for her forty-seven years of age. She exercised regularly, sometimes with Cassidy, most of the time alone.</p>
		<p>This afternoon, for instance, she received Cassidy's call and immediately made plans to meet at the gym.</p>
		<p>Bailey's Gym, located uptown on McGuire Boulevard owned the whole building from which it operated. Large beige stucco, one hundred years old, it held six floors reserved strictly to all exercise and therapeutic equipment. Its other seven floors were used for offices for employees and physiotherapists that decided to operate from there.</p>
		<p>Presently, Ashleigh was walking on the treadmill, on the Hill Level. She'd been at it for a little over thirty minutes and the sweat was running in rivulets down her sculpted body. Cassidy was running on her own treadmill, her leg muscles shifting visibly and attractively. It was all Ashleigh could do to not loose her footing and fall off the mill. She and Cassidy had slept together a good amount of times, but were also well acquainted as friends. Not that sex between them was bad; indeed, it was mind-blowing. "For a much younger woman,"- twenty years younger, in fact,- She once breathlessly told Cassidy, "You sure know how to use your hands." They cared about each other, very much, and never gave up the opportunity to do things together.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh had met Cassidy when she was in her tenth year as a doctor. Cassidy had been seventeen, and had been brought in dying from self-inflicted severely deep slices to both her wrists. Ashley definitely saved her, a crash operation that brought the veins back together and the precariously open skin closed, all performed in the Emergency Room. Cassidy remained unconscious for three and a half days, no visits from her parents, and Ashleigh could remember leaning against the bed and staring at the beautiful young woman she was. And that hadn't changed, Cassidy was as gorgeous as ever. Ashleigh had to wonder what brought Cassidy to that extreme. She remembered Andrea and how she saw the reason Cassidy fell so helplessly in love with her.</p>
		<p>Andrea nurtured Cassidy back to life, back to health. She never missed a day without seeing her. She would run over right after school and remain there until her father would pick her up at the end of the visiting hours. Andrea had a beautiful smile and gorgeous loving eyes that would make anyone's head lighten. "Ash," Cassidy said, a little out of breath. She flicked her wetly bouncing hair from her forehead in an impatient gesture. Ashleigh found the gesture adorable. "What are you thinking of?"</p>
		<p>Ashleigh smiled at her, wiping the sweat off her forehead with her towel. "Of Andrea, when she went to see you at the hospital, when you and I first met." She replied in her throaty voice. "You were so obviously in love then."</p>
		<p>Cassidy's eyes widened. "Have I always been that obvious?" She asked, awed.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh punched the buttons that would stop the machine. It slowed to a stop. Cassidy did the same, and stood with taut legs wide, taking deep breaths and wringing her wide shoulders. Ashleigh touched her shoulder with her large doctor's hand and Cassidy stopped her movements. "You always were, Cas." She said softly, squeezing her shoulder. "I'm still trying to figure out how Andrea doesn't know." The touch of her hand was so comforting. Cassidy felt like crying.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh crooned, seeing her gathering tears and pulling her into an embrace.</p>
		<p>"I love her so much!" Cassidy gasped, feeling the tears stinging her eyes. Her body shook with her suppressed tears, but she suddenly pulled back, meeting Ashleigh's eyes with her own. "I'm hurting, Ash!" She said raggedly, and turned away, wiping at her tears. Her cheeks and nose were flushed; her sensuous mouth was now a thin line of despair.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh watched her, compassion and deep caring squeezing her heart. "You don't talk about this," She said softly, touching her chest with her finger. "Why don't you come to my place after dinner?" She suggested, deciding right there and then that she'd make love to her then, to give Cassidy her care. They hadn't for almost a year, and it was about time.</p>
		<p>Cassidy nodded, knowing what would happen. She wanted it, and who better with than Ashleigh. "I'll see you tonight, then." She said, sniffing. She looked at the large face of her designer watch. SIX THIRTY FIVE. "I have to go, Ash. But I'll call you on my way over."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>She let the phone ring three times before picking it up. She reached over to her bedside table. "Hello?" She said breathlessly, sitting back down on the bed and bending over to continue to pull her tight white socks.</p>
		<p>"It is Carey. How are you?" The friendly voice with the thick Irish accent on the other line said.</p>
		<p>Andrea smiled at the sound of her friend's voice. "Hi!" She greeted. "I'm glad to hear from you." She continued sincerely.</p>
		<p>Carey laughed. "So am I." She noticed Andrea's uneasy breathing. "What in the world are you doing?"</p>
		<p>Andrea laughed. "Sicko," She teased. "Pulling on my socks, I'm having dinner with Cassidy tonight."</p>
		<p>Carey smiled. "So what's the miracle?" She asked, surprised.</p>
		<p>Andrea shrugged, chuckling gently. "I don't know, but I'm taking advantage." She said softly, not really knowing what to say about Cassidy's disappearing acts, except that she constantly missed her and thought of her. In times of distress over Cassidy's disappearances, Andrea had always called Carey for consolation and advice. She hurt so much when Cassidy avoided her, in a way that left her feeling so empty inside.</p>
		<p>"How was Valentine's dinner with her?" Carey asked.</p>
		<p>Andrea sighed, remembering the evening as if it were yesterday, specially dancing with Cassidy. "It was great... and I cried. I didn't know I missed her so much." She said slowly. "It felt so good to hold her close like that, you know? We danced a lot."</p>
		<p><i>Well, what do you know? Could Andy be in love with Cassidy and not even know it?</i> She mused, her eyebrows arching; she nodded slowly to herself in answer. "You and Cassidy?"</p>
		<p>Andrea smiled softly. "Yes," She said dreamily. "She's a great dancer, better than any of my boyfriends. And Jeffrey doesn't dance, really. Nevertheless, I never really liked to dance with any of them, not since Cassidy first danced with me." She knew she must have been rambling, but when it came to Cassidy, she always rambled.</p>
		<p>"What time are you leaving?" Carey asked.</p>
		<p>Andrea glanced at her watch. SEVEN FORTY FIVE, the face said. "In about fifteen minutes." She replied, leaning back on the bed when she finished.</p>
		<p>"Okay, then." Carey said. "Call me tomorrow. Maybe we can have some dinner."</p>
		<p>"Okay, say hello to Roseanne for me, will you?" Andrea said, smiling.</p>
		<p>"Will do." Carey said, smiling. "Bye."</p>
		<p>Both women hung up. Not five minutes passed before the loud sound of a horn pierced the air. Andrea shook her head at the sound, laughing, and picking up her jean jacket from the coat rack. She walked out of the apartment, turning off all the lights.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Cassidy's breath caught in her throat at the sight of casually clad Andrea as she came down the steps of her brownstone house. She wore black cargo shorts and a white short-sleeve T-shirt. Her yellow construction boots were new and not scuffed yet; her white socks were rolled down to her ankles. Her hair was loose and windswept. She looked adorably young and preppy. She watched her jump into the passenger seat of her red Mustang Convertible. "Hi," Andrea said, throwing her arms over Cassidy's shoulders and pulling her close to kiss her cheek.</p>
		<p>The sweet scent of her perfume, Cassidy recognized it as Versace, sent a shiver through her. "Hi," She said shyly, taken aback by the hot-cold shiver running through her body. She shifted gears and pulled into traffic. "Where are we going?" She asked after a few minutes of silence, in which she remembered the memorized feeling of Andrea's breast pressing against her arm.</p>
		<p>Andrea grinned, turning over in her seat to stare at Cassidy. "Benny's." She said softly, allowing her eyes to take in Cassidy's soft beauty. Every time she stared at her, she seemed to newly realize a little more of how beautiful Cassidy's whole body was. Tonight she realized how beautiful her profile was. Her forehead high, but softly feminine, it softly blended with the perfectly straight nose; her lips were smooth and full, her thick lower lip pouted sensuously. Her eyebrows were thin and black, and her lashes long and naturally curly. Her jaw was strong and chiseled. Her skin was so smooth looking that Andrea couldn't help but reach out and touch her skin. "You're beautiful, Cassidy." She whispered, feeling her heart swell.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's heartbeat quickened as she felt the strong intensity of Andrea's gaze upon her. She didn't trust herself to answer. She pressed the play button on her car radio, and the soft music of Tara MacLean, a new pop singer, blared out of her speakers. The song, titled 'That's me,' rang a bell inside Cassidy, and she listened quietly, like always. Andrea sat back, and listened too.</p>
		<p>Benny's was a brand new restaurant built two years ago. Its interiors were decorated tastefully to make its patrons feel comfortable, and to allow them to dress as they wished. The chairs and tables were made of a comfortable and stylish silvery metal; they gave it the quality of modernity. Inside, Andrea took out the time to see what Cassidy was wearing, and approved. She wore snug Kakhi shorts, a black T-shirt and white sneakers. Andrea noticed the tautness of the muscles on her legs and thighs, and asked: "You've been going to the gym?" She sat down on the chair Cassidy pulled out for her.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled. "Yes, I have. Today was the last time, actually." She answered, settling down across from her. "I went with Ashleigh."</p>
		<p>Andrea smiled at Cassidy. "You've seen Ashleigh?" She asked. "How is she?" She knew of Cassidy's various encounters with Ashleigh, and found it slightly amusing that a woman her age could still do such passionate and energetic romps with someone as young as Cassidy was, compared to her. <i>But then again,</i> Andrea thought. <i>Ashleigh Simmons is in great shape.</i> She knew that at one point, when Cassidy had been twenty-one, she'd ended up sleeping with Ashleigh, and that their already strong friendship was made even stronger by that fact.</p>
		<p>"She's doing great. I'm seeing her again later on tonight." Cassidy said, smiling back at Andrea. "She sends her greetings."</p>
		<p>"Tell her I said hello too." Andrea said, a knowing smile on her lips. They paused as their waiter asked for their orders. After he left them, Andrea whispered, reaching over and touching Cassidy's hand with the tips of her fingers: "I've really missed you, Cassidy." Her eyes searched for Cassidy's, which were locked to their touching hands. She couldn't seem to stop telling her that she missed her.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's throat constricted, she couldn't speak. She looked up at Andrea, trying not to let her emotions show through them. She lost herself in the blue of Andrea's gaze, her heart beating quickly out of control. "Andy," She said hoarsely, knowing she wasn't making a good show at hiding how deep her feelings for Andrea really were. Now it depended on Andrea to see or not. She pulled her hand away; the spot Andrea touched felt as if it were burning.</p>
		<p>Andrea didn't see the emotions playing across Cassidy's eyes; she just didn't know how to read it in her gaze. A thought occurred to her. "Let's have a picnic, this weekend or the next." She said impulsively, wanting to spend more time with her. "Jeffrey is going to be away on business matters. Just you and me, at Fountain Woods?" She pleaded with her eyes. Fountain Woods had been the place where they would go together in their youth so that Cassidy would get away from the misery at home, and where they could be together alone. The thought brought back wonderful memories to both women. "Where we used to go all the time, remember? To be together," She whispered, never taking her eyes off Cassidy's.</p>
		<p>Cassidy couldn't stand to look into her eyes; she looked down at the table. Andrea took her hands into hers. "What's wrong, Cassidy?" She demanded softly. "I'm your <i>best friend</i>, you need to talk to me." Her eyes watered.</p>
		<p>Cassidy closed her eyes tightly against the lightheaded feeling of the love she held for Andrea in her heart. Impulsively, she pulled Andrea's hands up to her lips, kissing them sweetly. Andrea held her breath, her eyes wide, feeling a flash of heat start in her heart and spread through her abdomen and then through her body. The lips pressed so passionately against her skin were silky and warm. She watched as Cassidy lowered her hands and remained still, her eyes closed with so much feeling.</p>
		<p>"So," She whispered hoarsely, her eyes taking in Cassidy's beauty without tiring. "Will you have the picnic with me at Fountain Woods?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy opened her eyes to Andrea's and nodded, staring at the full pink lips. <i>She has such lovely lips.</i> She thought fleetingly. "Yes," She said, smiling tenderly at her. She couldn't say no to her.</p>
		<p>Andrea was delighted, her eyes brightened visibly and she seemed to glow. Their food arrived and they ate, also talking. Andrea did most of the talking. "Roseanne," She was saying with great enthusiasm around her huge chicken sandwich. "You remember her, don't you? Her mother is Carey Mitchell."</p>
		<p>Cassidy nodded, relieved to be out of the intensity of the previous moment. "Yes, I remember her." She said, munching on her own sandwich, a broiled fish delight.</p>
		<p>"Well," Andrea continued, her blue eyes glistening. "The other day, she said to me that..."</p>
		<p>Cassidy allowed her eyes the freedom of taking in Andrea's angelic beauty as she spoke. She could see Andrea blushing slightly, she couldn't wonder why, so intense was her gaze. She laughed at something Andrea said about Roseanne; she was so clearly fond of the girl. Suddenly, she stopped, gazing back at Cassidy. "Talk to me about you." She said, a serious tone in her voice.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's gaze fell to the table; she didn't know what to say. She didn't really like to talk about herself. Andrea asked her about work, knowing Cassidy like the palm of her hand. Or so she thought. "Well, I gave in the article." Cassidy said. "Joel got back to me today. He said he loved it. It'll be published on Wednesday's edition."</p>
		<p>Andrea beamed proudly. "I'm so proud and happy for you, Cassidy! You should never doubt that he would accept it. You're the best." She gushed. She was happy every time Cassidy got a huge story and would pass the test with beaming approval. Even though it happened very often, every single time made Andrea proudly happy.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled shyly. "Thank you." She said in a low voice.</p>
		<p>Andrea smiled, taking another bite of her huge sandwich. "I'm so glad that you didn't say no to my invitation." She said.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's eyes snapped back up to hers and she smiled. "I'm glad too, Andy." She said. "I did not mean to hurt you."</p>
		<p>Andrea reached over to cover her hand again. "I know," She said. "Though I wish you'd tell me why you've been avoiding me."</p>
		<p>"It's nothing, really." Cassidy said, covering Andrea's hand with her other hand. She looked into the eyes of the woman she loved so much and said softly: "I really love you, Andy."</p>
		<p>Andy sighed, feeling very keenly the warmth and softness of the hands enveloping hers. "I love you too, Cassidy." She whispered.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled, wanting so much to be able to kiss her lips. "I'm really glad you do, Andy." She said, taking her hands away and sitting back, her protective shield in place. "I wouldn't know what to do without you."</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Five">
		<p>Ashleigh was sitting on her couch comfortably; her feet propped up on her glass coffee table. She was immersed in a book, thinking about Cassidy from time to time; she was dressed comfortably, in a white tank top and black shorts, feet bare. She was wondering how it was going with Andrea, if this would be the night when she would tell her how deep her feelings really were. <i>But then again,</i> Ashleigh thought, reprimanding herself. <i>I should know better.</i></p>
		<p>She'd gotten home from the gym and gone right to sleep, knowing full well that she'd be staying up that night. It was almost twelve now, and Cassidy had just called to let her know that she was about a half-hour away from her. Ashleigh, as soon as she'd heard the husky voice with the Portuguese accent, had felt a prickle of excitement rush through her body. She lost her concentration on the book, thinking of Cassidy's voice playing against her ear as they had sex, the very sexy things she'd say to her as she touched her, as Ashleigh touched <i>her</i>.</p>
		<p>A damp quiver between her legs answered the sound of her musical doorbell. She stood up and went to the door, opening it to Cassidy, who held a bottle of expensive red wine in one hand, two shiny wineglasses cradled against the other. Taking a sharp breath, she allowed her eyes to take in Cassidy's sensuously lithe body, the strength of her legs, of her arms.</p>
		<p>Gesturing for her to come in, she removed the bottle of wine from Cassidy's hand. She hastily pulled her into an embrace and took possession of her lips, pushing her tongue into the waiting mouth and feeling a jolt of pleasure rush through her body. Cassidy responded, feeling her own body react to Ashleigh's, surging against hers. It was all she could do to not drop the two fragile glasses in her hand. She felt the bottle of cool wine in Ashleigh's hand press against the small of her back, and that turned her on even more. A warm wet feeling between her legs spread onto her underwear and shorts. She was wet beyond redemption, and she pulled away to place the glasses on the small table by the door.</p>
		<p>She turned back to Ashleigh and wrapped her arms around the small waist, kicking the door closed and pushing her towards the couch. Ashleigh's strong arms wrapped around her shoulders, holding her from falling. Their tongues were exploring, their hands squeezing taut muscles and touching soft skin. Cassidy's face was on Ashleigh's neck, her tongue and lips playing with the sensitive area below her ear. Ashleigh was moaning, her shaking hands struggling with the wine bottle, attempting to uncork it as Cassidy's strong body worked over hers. She felt the soft lips leave her as Cassidy pulled away from her and took the bottle away. She uncorked it with her bare hands and took a mouth full from the bottle. Leaning forward, lingering over Ashleigh, she brought her lips to hers and allowed the now warm liquid to go from her mouth to the other. Ashleigh groaned, deeply, and swallowed the delicious wine.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh was completely naked in seconds.</p>
		<p>She arched as Cassidy poured the cool, tasty wine over her painfully engorged nipples and the flat plain of her stomach. She shuddered as the silky lips suckled the wine from her skin and nipples. Cassidy poured again, and finished the wine on her. Feeling her own body trembling and quivering between her legs, she grabbed the long neck of the bottle, and brought it between Ashleigh's wide-open thighs. Ashleigh gasped as she was entered, as the neck was brought in as far as it would go. She moaned, her fingers gripping Cassidy's back frantically.</p>
		<p>She trembled violently as Cassidy began twisting the bottle slowly, at the same time maneuvering it in and out. Feeling an orgasm coiling tightly inside her as Cassidy licked her clitoris and pumped the bottle, her hips jerked erratically and a cry rose in her throat. Her arms around Cassidy's shoulders, her fingers pressing against the line of her lean back, pressed harder. Cassidy pulled the bottle out, opened her legs wider inserting her tongue into her to feel the tight tremors of the flooded walls inside her. Her lips pressing against the flesh to feel the intense wetness of her making.</p>
		<p>With a strong high thrust of her hips, Ashleigh came into Cassidy's mouth, wave after wave of intensity coming and coming. She lay sweating and exhausted on the couch afterwards, Cassidy on top of her, sweating too. They were kissing slowly and deeply, as they always did, after a mind-blowing session of sex. "Will you stay the night?" Ashleigh asked, wanting to please her just as she'd been pleased.</p>
		<p>Cassidy laid her head on her shoulder and nodded, feeling drowsy and ready to sleep. "Did you have fun?" She asked softly, a smile played across her lips.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh playfully smacked one of her tight butt-cheeks, and Cassidy jumped. "You know it's not necessary to ask!" She chuckled. She groaned as Cassidy's hips began pressing between her legs rhythmically. "Oh, no, you don't!" She gasped and managed to swing them around so that she was now on top. Her hand went into Cassidy's shorts and between Cassidy's legs and she inserted her fingers into the heated wetness that was coming from deep inside. Cassidy thrust her hips upwards and she cried out, loosing herself to Ashleigh's strong expert fingers.</p>
		<p>The next morning, as they had breakfast, showered and half-dressed; they spoke quietly between bites of egg and cheese sandwiches. Cassidy was mostly silent, and Ashleigh finally ended up just staring at her. Cassidy's eyes were attached to the plate on the table in front of her; she nibbled on her sandwich. <i>God,</i> Ashleigh thought amusedly. <i>She could be so adorably shy sometimes. It's hard to tell we had mind-blowing sex just last night.</i></p>
		<p>"Cassidy," She said, reaching across the table and taking Cassidy's hand. "How was dinner with Andrea?" She asked when Cassidy met her eyes.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled, her, mind going back to thoughts of Andrea. "It was great." She said softly, her eyes veering away from Ashleigh's.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh smiled. "What did you guys do?" She asked gently, squeezing Cassidy's hand comfortingly.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled, staring down at their hands. "We mostly talked about things between us; you know, our friendship and stuff. She asked me if I wanted to have a picnic with her in a couple of weeks..." She paused. "I couldn't say no."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh sat back on her chair and smacked the table aggressively. "And why should you say no?" She inquired.</p>
		<p>Cassidy shrugged, looking everywhere except Ashleigh's eyes. She started to say: "Well, you know Jeffrey and every-"</p>
		<p>Ashleigh smacked the table even harder. The plates, the cups, everything rattled. "Jeffrey!" She exclaimed, surprising even Cassidy, who knew her very well. And knew that she didn't usually explode in this manner. Ashleigh was known for her calm demeanor and her never exploding temper. At Crystal City Hospital, Ashleigh was known by only a few to have a volatile temperament and those were the stupid ones who tried her patience. "Fuck Jeffrey!" She said with clenched teeth.</p>
		<p>"Ash-" Cassidy said uncertainly.</p>
		<p>"You're her best friend," Ashleigh continued, as if Cassidy hadn't said anything. "He cannot go there, and if Andy were to let him, she'd be the fool." She looked at Cassidy with angry green eyes. "And you know," She wagged a long finger at her. "You're the bigger fool for letting him win the battles, by not even <i>trying</i> to win her heart in the way that you want it." She stood up and walked away from the table to lean against the light wood cabinets with strong arms crossed, her eyes locked to Cassidy's in a reprimanding way.</p>
		<p>Cassidy stared back at her with surprised eyes. "Ashleigh," She said hesitantly, afraid she'd be interrupted again. When Ashleigh didn't say anything, just staring at her in her intimidating manner, she continued: "I just don't think I should involve myself in their relationship..."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh stopped her with a sharp gesture; her hand sliced through the air. "It's not about getting involved, Cassidy," She said intensely, almost growling at her. "It's about taking what belongs to <i>you</i>. It's about telling Andrea Cates that you are in love with her, that you love her like no one ever could. That you'd give your life to her with all the passion and love in the world."</p>
		<p>Cassidy stared at the plate on the table, feeling her eyes wet with tears, her hands playing at her lap. She held back the tears and looked up to stare at her. "I will never tell Andy my true feelings for her." She said firmly, standing up from the table and leaving the kitchen and Ashleigh behind.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh watched her go, smiling to herself; she was satisfied that she'd gotten through the hard exterior Cassidy had built for herself. Minutes later, she heard Cassidy's footsteps returning towards the kitchen. She was fully dressed now, holding her jacket at the crook of her arm. She shuffled at the threshold, unable to look into Ashleigh's eyes. "You're going," Ashleigh whispered, only slightly disappointed. Still, she was satisfied she got through the tough exterior, got some emotion to show through the mask. For as long as she'd known Cassidy, she'd never seen her show so much as an ounce of emotion, except the one time they were at the gym. But Cassidy had pushed the display away without so much as a backward glance, as if it had never happened. She knew Cassidy had a lot to think about. "When will I see you again?" She asked.</p>
		<p>"Some time this week, Ash." Cassidy said softly. "I'll call you." She turned and walked away, leaving the apartment quietly.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>She was in her car, waiting for the light to turn from red to green. She pulled her cellular out of her jacket pocket and dialed. Robie picked up on the third ring. She sounded glad to hear from Cassidy. "Well hello, stranger!" She said, a smile on her voice. Last time she'd heard from her had been Sunday. She'd tried to call her, but had been unable to communicate through the cellular; Cassidy had turned it off. "Where were you, woman?" She asked playfully.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled, chuckling softly. "I hung out with Andrea last night, we had dinner," She said, pretending to be thoughtful. The light turned green; with one hand on the steering wheel, she pressed her foot softly on the gas pedal. "Then I hung out with Ashleigh. And that's it."</p>
		<p>Robie chuckled also. She teased: "Hung out with Ashleigh, isn't that the doctor you're..."</p>
		<p>"<i>Yes</i>, Robie," Cassidy said, trying to hold back her laughter. "That's the doctor who treated me a few years ago."</p>
		<p>"Okay, okay. I get it." Robie said, laughing. "So how was dinner with Andrea?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy stopped at another light. "It was great, we talked a lot." She said, and nothing more, suddenly quiet and apprehensive.</p>
		<p>Robie shook her head, knowing full well that Cassidy had just clamped up on her. She tried another tactic, knowing full well how to get around her. "Why don't you come over later, Cassidy?" She asked soothingly. "I'll cook you dinner..."</p>
		<p>Cassidy was soothed by her voice, and she nodded. Catching herself, she said: "Yes, okay."</p>
		<p>Robie smiled, already thinking of what she would cook for her. "Okay, then," She said. "What time do you want to come over?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled. "At nine or so? I have some people to see today." She said.</p>
		<p>"No other girlfriends, I hope." Robie said warningly, a smile hidden in her voice.</p>
		<p>Cassidy laughed, driving off when the light changed and making a left on Grand Place. She lived about five blocks away. "No, just friends. Gretchen and George." She said.</p>
		<p>"Good, tell them I said hi, and that I'll talk to them later," Robie said. "See you at nine."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>From his uptown office, Jeffrey dialed the number he knew Andrea would be at that time. She would be on her lunch hour, most definitely sitting behind the desk in the small office she shared with another teacher. Maybe she was with that young woman, Roxanne, he thought her name was, chatting away like usual. He wanted to talk to her, though, and he didn't care whom she was talking to or if she was talking to somebody. The phone rang three times and Andrea picked up with a warming hello. "Hey, hon." He said, not able to hold back a smile at just the sound of her voice.</p>
		<p>"Hi, Jeff." Andrea said, sounding glad to hear from him. "How are you?"</p>
		<p>Jeffrey felt warm all over. "I'm fine, baby. What about you?" He replied, really wanting to instantly ask about her dinner with Cassidy. When Andrea told him she was having dinner with an air of finality seldom in her voice, he knew better than to even argue with her. Or to say that he really wanted her to come to dinner with him and his business friends instead, because he knew she would say no to anything just to be with Cassidy Monsignor. Just the thought of her angered him intensely, he always tried to control that anger around Andrea, and it was very hard.</p>
		<p>"I'm fine too," Andrea said. "How did your dinner go?" She asked.</p>
		<p>"It went great..." He said softly. "I thought a lot about you, though."</p>
		<p>Andrea smiled from her side of the line. "That's sweet, Jeff." She said softly. "I thought about you too." She was lying, the only thing in her mind the night before was Cassidy, and Cassidy only.</p>
		<p>Jeffrey brightened. "Did you, really?" He asked, feeling like everything was fine again. He was having a hard time the night before, just thinking that Andrea was alone with Cassidy. That Cassidy could manipulate her into having... He shook his head vehemently; just the thought disgusted him.</p>
		<p>"I did." Andrea said softly, trying to soothe him. He was so much like a child sometimes. She was alone in the office, but she didn't really want to be on the phone with him for some reason. She'd just spent the last twenty-five minutes staring at the wall, thinking of what she'd bring with her the day of her picnic with Cassidy. The phone sliced through her happy thoughts like a knife through thread. "Jeffy, I have to go." She said softly, trying to sound apologetic. Not really feeling that way. "Call me at home tonight, will you?"</p>
		<p>Jeffrey smiled. "Okay," He said. "I will. Maybe I'll pass by."</p>
		<p>Andrea said okay, and hung up with him. She sat back on her chair and stared at the wall again, contemplating once again what she would bring with her to the picnic.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Six">
		<p>Gretchen Brea sat down across from Cassidy on her stylish terrace and studied her with self-possessed brown eyes. She always appreciated Cassidy's beauty, could never pass up any time that Cassidy went to see her. Gretchen was a year older than Cassidy, they'd known each other for a little over six years, when Cassidy was going to the same college Gretchen was attending for law. Gretchen had been immediately seduced by Cassidy's intense seriousness. Gretchen had been all no joke and laughs, and Cassidy was a perfect contrast.</p>
		<p>Cassidy was beautiful then, as she was now. As was Gretchen, who had indeed seduced Cassidy with her British accent and snobbish attitude. Gretchen was also physically alluring, with deep brown eyes and a full black mane. A face out of a painting, narrowly straight nose, and full reddish lips, including imposingly beautiful full-figured body. Her voice was husky, though attractively feminine with its accent.</p>
		<p>As they spoke, with a slight flush to her cheeks, Cassidy recalled all those hotly intense moments between them. The sex between them had been volatile, explosive. Not one encounter would go by without each woman having a most intense orgasm more than once. Actually, sometimes they'd reached record in their sex, not pausing for many hours, until exhaustion and need for sleep stopped them. <i>Those were the days</i>, Cassidy thought with nostalgia.</p>
		<p>But Gretchen was now happily engaged to a beautiful and young Australian woman called Georgette; they'd been together for almost a year. Her friends called her George.</p>
		<p>Georgette Peterson was a prominent architect and interior designer with talent that many wish they had. Her talents weren't the only things that were envied about George. Her looks were roguishly beautiful, with a full head of short jet-black hair that framed her gorgeous face, a healthy dark olive complexion, and shiny blue eyes. She was tall like Cassidy, five foot nine, and had a body much like Cassidy's also, lithe, toned and muscled.</p>
		<p>Via Gretchen, Cassidy hired George to design her kitchen. George, who had liked Cassidy the moment she met her despite the fact that she knew about the tempestuous affair between Cassidy and Gretchen, wanted to do the job for free. But Cassidy refused to accept the gratuity and paid her with an article on the "promising architect and interior designer Georgette Peterson."</p>
		<p>Cassidy had many followers of her articles and books, many fans, and within days of the publishing of the article, flocs were flowing to hire George. George was grateful, and still owed Cassidy one, she swore. George was a lot like Cassidy, faithful to her friends and warm. Gretchen thought that's what made her fall in love in the first place. But soon, Gretchen saw past the similarities between George and Cassidy, and saw the George that was within, and fell in love anew.</p>
		<p>Presently, Gretchen was telling Cassidy of the hand-fasting date so that she could tell Andrea and Robie, and bring them. It would be in six months, and Gretchen wanted Cassidy to be her "best-lady." She was talking with a vigor Cassidy had never seen in her, a happiness that was unmistakably intense. She was happy for her, and wished she could have that kind of happiness for herself. But she knew that couldn't be, for her happiness lay only in the arms of Andrea Cates, the love of her life.</p>
		<p>The struggle she was going through at that moment was tearing her apart, thinking of Andrea, dreaming that it would be the two of them who would be together. She wanted so badly to hold her, to make love to her, to love her the way she wished she could. She was unaware of her eyes drifting away from Gretchen to a spot above her head. She was also unaware of Gretchen stopping her chatter to stare at her with knowing sympathy. "Cassidy," Gretchen said softly, but Cassidy still was away in her thoughts. Gretchen leaned forward, grasping her leg and squeezing it softly, saying firmly: "Cassidy."</p>
		<p>Cassidy started, and stared at Gretchen as if she didn't see her. "Oh, God, I'm so sorry!" She gushed, shaking her head. "I'm sorry, Gretchen, I don't know what came over me."</p>
		<p>Gretchen knew what had come over her, and that was thoughts of Andrea. Ever since their days together, Gretchen knew Cassidy's heart belonged to Andrea, and always would.</p>
		<p>Now it was a matter of Andrea's heart belonging to her. She always saw a behavior in Andrea towards Cassidy that no best friend ever had for another. Without realizing it, Andrea acted as if she too were in love with Cassidy. Never able to go a few hours without speaking to her; when they were together, never able to take her eyes off her, never able to stop hugging her. When they danced, fitting her body against Cassidy's as if it were a temple and it was an honor to press against it to sway to the music. Her eyes held tightly shut, the lids trembling slightly.</p>
		<p>And if Andrea <i>were</i> in love with Cassidy, Gretchen wouldn't be surprised. Cassidy was the dream of any woman who got to know her, perfect in every fashion, in every sense. She was surprised Robie wasn't asking her to marry her already, but then she knew that Robie's heart was someone else's. She had been the one who had introduced Robie and Cassidy. She knew of Robie's lover Isabella Del Monte, a prominent archeologist out in Europe or Africa or some place like that. She'd seen the devastation in Robie's eyes when she and Isabella agreed that it was best if they stopped being together if Isabella had to go far and for a long time because of her job. Robie had been desolate for months, until Gretchen had pushed her back into the dating world, instantly calling Cassidy up and pushing them to meet.</p>
		<p>Cassidy and Robie clicked instantly, and were more friends than anything else, though sex wasn't taken out of their friendship. They were still dating, but that was as far as it got.</p>
		<p>Gretchen smiled forgivingly at her friend, squeezing her thigh softly and letting go. "Its okay, Cassidy baby," She said in her husky, accented voice. "I know how Andrea brings this out on you, honey. Maybe you shouldn't walk around with this weight on your shoulders, my dear. Maybe you should confess to her that-"</p>
		<p>Cassidy cut her off with an impatient, angry gesture, standing from the lounging chair she had claimed. She glared down at Gretchen, feeling cornered by everything and everyone. "Can't I go to places without worrying that every single one of my friends is going to pressure me into doing something I don't want to do?" She growled at her, not able to hold back her anger.</p>
		<p>Gretchen stared at her unflinchingly, allowing her to spew out her anger. She didn't say one thing to her for a long while, just stared at her, watching the conflicting emotions playing across the noble features. With a lilting arch of her eyebrow, Gretchen pursed her lips in musing. "I don't know why you put yourself through this agony," She finally said in an even voice, though she was frustrated. "When all you have to do is tell Andrea that you love her and she would fall into your arms like the woman in love with you that she is."</p>
		<p>Cassidy closed her eyes tightly, clenching her jaw. "Andrea... is... a... virile... <i>hetero</i>sexual... woman..." She pronounced every word with rising anger. "I... am... only... her... best friend-"</p>
		<p>Gretchen felt like releasing a 'wake up and smell the coffee' hand and allowing it to land across Cassidy's face, but that had been one of the reasons for their agreeing to end their relationship. Physical abuse against one another, inability to restrain their anger. She shook the memories away. Unhappy memories of their past were not necessary at that moment. "Cassidy," She said, standing up from her chair and staring up in bewilderment at her friend. "I can't believe you are so <i>hard</i>-headed sometimes! Goodness gracious!" She exclaimed in exasperation.</p>
		<p>Cassidy turned away from her and crossed her arms, a double wall against Gretchen. "Gretchen," Cassidy said in as even a voice as she could muster, and paused. "I love Andrea as I've never loved anything or anyone in my life." She said softly afterwards, closing her eyes against the pain. "I could not live if I lost her because of my feelings, I could not endure the thought of Andrea leaving me because of my feelings for her... She is my world, my sun... I would die, Gretchen." Her voice was thick with tears; she closed her eyes against them. "I would take my own life." She brought out her arms to stare at her scarred wrists. "It hasn't been hard for me before..." Her voice trailed off.</p>
		<p>"Even now," She continued in a low voice, never taking her eyes away from the ever-tempting scars. "Even now that I have her as my best friend, I feel the need to just cease to exist, to just leave this godforsaken world and this misery. A misery I have no idea where it came from." She spoke numbly, unaware of Gretchen's tears. "She is the only thing that keeps me anchored, that keeps me from attempting against myself again. I can't bear the thought of loosing her."</p>
		<p>Gretchen was instantly sorry she'd pressured Cassidy. She never really knew how vulnerable Cassidy really was. The tough exterior was so well in place that even <i>she</i> couldn't see past it. Except for now. She turned Cassidy to face her and hugged her tightly, placing her hand behind Cassidy's head and forcing her face to rest against her shoulder. Cassidy didn't resist for long, she wrapped her arms around Gretchen's plush waist and rested against her. "I'm sorry, Cassidy baby," Gretchen crooned, feeling for her from the very bottom of her heart. "I'm so very sorry."</p>
		<p>She felt Cassidy nod against her shoulder, tightening her arms around her waist in a forgiving gesture. She pulled back after a long moment and just stared at her friend with eyes full of pain. And then she smiled her beautiful charming smile, the smile that only brought a lilt to the right side of her lips, that made her eyes crinkle at the corners, and a gentle dimple appear on her right cheek. <i>She has always been so stunning,</i> Gretchen thought with deep love for her friend.</p>
		<p>"You're my friend, right?" Cassidy asked huskily, moving her head forward and pressing her forehead against Gretchen's. </p>
		<p>Gretchen nodded slowly. "And I love you as such." She replied softly. "I want you to always know that I am here, and so is George. She loves you very much, Cassidy." She suddenly threw her head back and laughed, bringing her hands down from Cassidy's shoulders to squeeze her arms tenderly. "I never thought a lover of mine would end up loving you as much as George does, considering the fact we meant so much to each other only a few years ago."</p>
		<p>"You still mean a lot to me, Gretchen," Cassidy said softly, still keeping her arms around Gretchen's waist and looking down at her. "You always will. And no matter how our relationship ended, you stuck by, as if I didn't do the things I did to you." She continued sadly.</p>
		<p>Gretchen shook her head softly in disagreement. "And what about from me to you, honey." She said gently, touching Cassidy's face tenderly. "What about what I did to you? We really fucked each other up back then, baby. It was all so unnecessary."</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled gently, feeling the smoothness of Gretchen's palm on her cheek. "You and George don't do that to each other, do you?" She asked softly with concern.</p>
		<p>A husky rumble came from Gretchen's throat. Laughter. "Ooh, no!" She said with laughter. "She would never take it." She paused, her laughter died away. She said in a low voice: "And I guess I've grown up. Haven't you, Cassidy-baby?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy nodded slowly. "I think I have too." She said. "Twenty eight in a few months, Gretchen. I'm getting old."</p>
		<p>"And more gorgeous by the minute." Gretchen said with a smile. She hugged Cassidy to her and pulled away slowly when they heard the door slam.</p>
		<p>George's boisterous accented voice carried across the apartment. "Cassidy," She called, sounding very happy. "Where the hell are you, old gal? I saw your car downstairs!"</p>
		<p>Cassidy laughed. "I'm right here, Georgie Porgy." She called out. George breezed through the terrace doors and ran to her, taking her in her arms. She rocked her tenderly, as she always did despite her strength. "Hey, George." Cassidy said with a laugh, wrapping her arms around her too.</p>
		<p>George pulled back, smiling at her. "Hey, baby." Her Australian accent punctuating the word "bay-by." She looked from Cassidy to Gretchen with mock suspicion. "What were you doing to my lover out here?" She asked with narrowed smiling blue eyes.</p>
		<p>Gretchen laughed and walked over to them, slapping her lightly on the butt. "You have one dirty mind, my lovely butch." She chided. "Now, come give me a kiss."</p>
		<p>George went to her and took her tightly into her strong arms, placing a nice wet kiss on her lips. "Hey, babe." She said softly, touching her lover's face with a finger. Gretchen seemed speechless at George's eternal tenderness; she just smiled.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled at her two friends. "Well, I've got to go." She said, looking at the time. EIGHT O'CLOCK. "Got a date with Robie tonight."</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Seven">
		<p>Andrea sat down on her couch, smiling at Carey Mitchell as she handed her a tall glass of orange juice. Carey had called and Andrea, in her loneliness, had asked her over to chat for a while. Jeffrey had left on his business trip already, and wouldn't be back for almost a month; new turn of events had taken place, and the business stay would last longer than planned.</p>
		<p>Carey smiled at Andrea, wondering what was bothering Andrea so much. As soon as she heard Andrea's voice over the phone lines, she knew that something was going on in Andrea's mind. She seemed sad, distracted, as if she were in another plane of this universe. Andrea asked her to visit her that night; told her that she needed someone to talk to. "Andrea," Carey said, brushing her thick red hair away from her forehead. She fixed her gray eyes on Andrea, forcing her with simply her will to look at her. "What's going on in that head of yours?" She asked softly, the melodious tilt of her Irish accent relaxing Andrea.</p>
		<p>Andrea sighed, not knowing herself what was happening to her. All she knew was that she couldn't keep her mind off Cassidy, could not stop thinking about her. Every time she closed her eyes, she could envision the way Cassidy looked when she drew Andrea's hands to her mouth and kissed them softly. The passion Andrea saw in her features could not be mistaken, the passion she realized afterwards that she'd also felt at that moment couldn't be mistaken either. She told Carey of this, of the way her heart beat out of control every time she was around Cassidy, every time Cassidy touched her or looked at her. Of the way her body responded when Cassidy held her, when they danced together. She was so confused, she wrung her hands and it looked as if she would rub off the skin.</p>
		<p>Carey nodded thoughtfully, and pursed her lips in satisfaction of her own foresight. Andrea was more than likely falling head over heels in love with Cassidy, or was realizing that she had been in love with Cassidy all along. She smiled, leaning forward, grasping Andrea's wringing hands and squeezing comfortingly. "Andrea," She said after a long while. "Have you told Cassidy of these sensations?"</p>
		<p>Andrea shook her head, looking as if telling Cassidy was out of the question. "No!" She said in a frantic whisper. "What if Cassidy wouldn't want to be my friend any more? What if she got scared of me or something?"</p>
		<p><i>She's so innocent in so many ways</i>. Carey thought with an inward smile. She met Cassidy once, and could instantly tell that Cassidy was deeply in love with Andrea. She didn't blame her. "Andrea, what you are feeling is something normal-"</p>
		<p>"Normal?" Andrea asked, cutting her off. "This feeling that my heart will burst out of my body when she looks at me? These feelings that my body will melt in her arms when she holds me close to dance or just to hug me?" She was turning red as she spoke, she closed her eyes with passion. "I mean... I was rambling on last night, and I could feel her eyes on me, all I could do was blush. My body just reacted when she kissed my hands, I felt a jolt of electricity like I'd never felt in my life with anyone. And you're telling me this is normal? She's my best friend, for God's sake!"</p>
		<p>Carey smiled patiently, her thin lips curving in a gentle smile. "Do you think you may be falling in love with your best friend? Could it be impossible?" She asked, bracing for any reaction.</p>
		<p>Andrea stood up from the couch and walked over to the window, pushing her fingers through her hair and staring out at the dark city. Falling in love with Cassidy? She didn't know. "I'm not." She said, shaking her head vehemently.</p>
		<p>Carey sat back on the couch and smiled, she didn't need to press on.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Eight">
		<p>That weekend, on a hot Saturday morning, Cassidy drove up to the front of Andrea's house and pressed on the horn. Not more than three minutes passed before Andrea was out the front door, packed up with a large basket and a cloth bag full of three wine bottles. Andy could hardly see above the bulk in her arms. Cassidy smiled as she got out of the car, walking over to the other side and opening the back door to place the items next to the down quilt where they would rest in the open field. Andrea had insisted that she'd provide the foods, and Cassidy would provide the comfort.</p>
		<p>They argued extensively on this, but then Andrea always got what she wanted out of Cassidy; and this time it was to bring the food. Cassidy got stuck with bringing the down comforter, a boom box radio, and some music. She'd looked through her extensive collection, and made tasteful choices of music by women they both liked. Andrea liked the music of Sheryl Crow, Paula Cole, Natalie Imbruglia, and such. Cassidy liked pretty much the same, including K.D. Lang, Indigo Girls, Shawn Colvin, Loreena Mckennit, etc. All in all, they went packed with a bunch of nice relaxing woman-oriented music.</p>
		<p>The sun was beautiful, and there was no sign of rain that day. There had been no warnings or anything. The gigantic yellowish orb was flashing its light upon this part of the world along with a gentle breeze. The weather was no more than seventy-five or eighty degrees, perfectly warm and relaxing. They drove in companionable silence with the convertible's hood down, feeling the breeze caress their faces and their hair gently. They listened to the radio on the way, a soft jazz station that had many followers, including both Andrea and Cassidy.</p>
		<p>They drove for almost two hours before they reached Fountain Woods, the highway was comfortingly deserted and the road was relaxing. It was two o'clock in the afternoon by the time they found their spot of so long ago, setting down their quilt and radio, and food. Cassidy parked about two hundred feet from the grassy spot, and they walked over to their area of comfort. Andrea dove right in for the white wine, taking out of the basket two glass goblets for them. She gave the bottle to Cassidy to open, and then she poured them each the wine. She lay down on the comforter, propping her head on her arm and crossing her shapely legs. She was staring adoringly up at Cassidy, who was working on the music.</p>
		<p>Indigo Girls was her first choice. The music played on low volume, but loud enough for them to hear. Cassidy turned away from the radio and lay down on the comforter also, laying her head on her bent arm and resting the goblet on the ground with her hand. She was a stunning sight to Andrea, who stared unflinchingly at her. Her blacker than black wavy hair was tied back in a soft ponytail, allowing her features to really be seen by Andrea. She wore khaki shorts and white sneakers with no socks, her smooth and muscled legs were a hypnotic sight to Andrea. Her white GAP button down shirt was loose and comfortable, the top four buttons left unbuttoned to reveal her beautiful skin beneath it.</p>
		<p>Andrea was intensely aware of Cassidy's beautiful skin beneath the shirt, the fact that she wore no bra, and of the sensuous languor of her body. In her fascination with Cassidy, she didn't realize that Cassidy's eyes were on her also.</p>
		<p>Unaware of Andrea's own stare, Cassidy took in the shapely beauty of her. She wore her hair in a high ponytail, her graceful and beautiful neck left exposed by the hairstyle. She wore a white cotton tube-top that was tight against her flat stomach and full chest. She wore no bra, and Cassidy could see the darker tint of her nipples. Her shorts were black, and reached above her knees, leaving the unmerciful sight of her lovely and shapely legs to Cassidy. Her pretty, small feet were encased in soft feminine sandals.</p>
		<p>Desire was no stranger to Cassidy when it came to Andrea, but the love that was mingled with it was unbearably intense. She took a sip from the wine, and spoke: "Tell me how school was." Her voice was hoarse, and she cleared her throat.</p>
		<p>Andrea sat up, crossing her legs and resting her elbows against her thighs. She took a sip from her goblet and laughed. "It's always a new experience, every single day." She said, and shook her head. "Two guys got into a fight over Roseanne Mitchell. You remember her?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy nodded, remembering the stunning energy and beauty of the Irish young girl. One night, at a dinner, she met Carey Mitchell and her highly energized and sweet young daughter. "Of course I remember." She said softly, gazing at Andrea admiringly.</p>
		<p>Andrea drew a deep breath, feeling warmed all over by Cassidy's gaze. "Roseanne, at this very moment is not interested in men," She said, musing. "For some reason, and I know this is not of her parents' making, she kind of gets crushes on young girls and teachers." She paused, and took a sip from her wine. "Well, anyway, these two guys start fighting right in front of her. And I mean fist fighting, really going at each other's throats. Mind you, they're football players. Roseanne surprises every body by running up to them and pulling one off the other by the hair. These are big guys, too." Andrea began laughing, remembering the whole scene.</p>
		<p>Cassidy laughed along with her, imagining Roseanne's small form pulling a huge football player off another.</p>
		<p>"So the other guy thinks she did this because she liked him better than the other," Andrea continued with a smile. "And he goes up to her ready for a big romantic kiss. She looks at him as if he were stupid or retarded or something, and tells him: 'Get off me, you big idiot!'" Andrea did a perfect imitation of Roseanne and her small Irish accent. "'Can't you see I have the biggest crush on Manuela Montero? Jesus, you guys are stupid!' And walks away from him as if he were a piece of garbage or something, with a look of disgust that was hilarious." She began to laugh again. "Meanwhile, everybody's just staring at Manuela in surprise. And she's blushing like a tomato, and smiling from here to New York City. Seems she has a little crush on Roseanne too."</p>
		<p>Cassidy laughed raucously, she could picture Roseanne doing all of this to the poor guy. "That Roseanne is just something out of the ordinary." She finally gasped. She took a mouthful from her goblet and finished the wine. Already she was feeling lightheaded. A song she liked from the Indigo Girls, named 'Caramia' came on. She smiled at Andrea and turned up the volume. She sat up and began to sing along with the sad song, her voice perfectly matching with that of the singers. She closed her eyes. "'...why are you dreaming this, one shoe off and a bridge to cross over...'"</p>
		<p>Andrea studied her with wide eyes. She was so beautiful, she couldn't take her eyes away from her. "'...and there's a sea full of faces and show to go on, and I'm struck mute at entrance with nothing to draw from...'" Cassidy's voice was sultry, sensuous, no strain was necessary to reach those cords. Andrea felt her heart swell, her body calling for Cassidy's. She wanted to dance with her, to feel her close again. She stood up, and stared down at her, extending her hand.</p>
		<p>Cassidy seemed to sense her movement through her concentration. She opened her eyes slowly and looked up at Andrea with wondering eyes. Andrea said softly: "Put the song over and sing it while we dance."</p>
		<p>Cassidy was breathless as she got to her feet. She started the song all over, and stepped out of the comforter onto the grass. She took Andrea's much smaller and sweaty hand and pulled her to herself. The song began just as she pulled Andrea into her arms, wrapping one arm around her thin waist and taking her hand with the other. The instruments broke right into the song, and so did they. Cassidy pulled her close, beginning to sway, hypnotized with the song, singing into her ear. Her body was sending such signals to her brain, signals that tortured her. She was aware of the pressure of Andrea's breasts against hers, of her pelvis pressing against her abdomen, her thighs pressing against hers. She didn't know what to do, how to control her rising arousal.</p>
		<p>She swayed their hips together just as she sang a verse that was accompanied by the beautiful sounds of violins. "'...and there's a sea full of faces and a show to go on, and I'm struck mute at entrance with nothing to draw from...'" Her voice gained power in this part, but it didn't bother Andrea at all. It sent a powerful sensation through her, a sensation she couldn't identify. She felt the soft rise and fall of Cassidy's breasts as she sang.</p>
		<p>Andrea sighed against Cassidy's neck, feeling the feathery caresses of Cassidy's breath and voice against her ear. She let herself be guided by Cassidy's body, by her hands, aware of a deep feeling in her heart, a feeling that was surfacing as they danced. She picked up her hand from Cassidy's shoulder and placed it behind her head, pulling her head down closer against her ear, wanting to hear her heavenly voice forever. The end of the song came, and she didn't want to let go of her, she didn't want Cassidy to let go either. And when Cassidy tried to pull away, she wrapped both arms around her shoulders and pulled her closer.</p>
		<p>Cassidy couldn't breathe, her feelings were so intense. The love, the desire.</p>
		<p>"Don't let me go, Cassidy, please!" Andrea gasped, not able to stop herself, wanting her close. She moaned helplessly. "Please..."</p>
		<p>Cassidy closed her eyes against the feeling, and pulled away, removing Andrea's arms from around her neck tenderly. She held them down against Andrea's body and gazed at her with anguish. Andrea gazed up into her eyes, staring at the reflection of the sunlight against the golden brown of them. "Andrea," Cassidy whispered with feeling, she closed her eyes. After a long moment, she let go of her and turned away.</p>
		<p>Andrea closed her eyes and sat down on the comforter. Turning towards the wine bottle, she took hold of it and poured more wine into both goblets. Cassidy walked a few feet away from her and sat down on the grass, laying back and covering her eyes with both arms. Andrea listened to the other songs playing on the radio, her head full of static and jumbled thoughts and passion. The CD reached its end over a half-hour later, and Cassidy was still laying a few feet away from the comforter. Andrea stared out at her, her knees pulled up and her arms wrapped around them.</p>
		<p>Finally, Cassidy sat up, bending her knees up and resting her forehead against them. She let her arms hang limply at her sides. She stood up after a few minutes and went back to the comforter. She sat down and stared at Andrea with wonder in her eyes. "This was all the wine, Andrea." She said, trying to explain to herself what had just happened.</p>
		<p>Andrea shook her head slowly, and looked down at her feet. "I don't think so, Cassidy." She said softly, so softly that Cassidy had to lean forward to hear her. The sight of the long graceful neck sent a shiver through Andrea.</p>
		<p>Cassidy pulled back and looked down pensively at the comforter. Suddenly, she said: "Let's just forget it, okay?" She reached for the basket, and brought out the cheese, bread and mayonnaise. She glanced up at Andrea, and it was as if nothing had happened between them just an hour before. Andrea felt very hurt; that Cassidy could dismiss what had just happened so easily. "Want a sandwich?" Cassidy asked nonchalantly.</p>
		<p>Andrea stared at her with hurt in her eyes, but Cassidy numbed her body against what she thought she saw, she didn't want to be mistaken. Finally, Andrea nodded, deciding to forget about it too if Cassidy was so quick to forget. "Ham and Cheese, no Mayo." She directed lightly, and watched as Cassidy prepared her sandwich with graceful fingers. Fingers she wished were running through her hair, touching her skin softly... She threw her head back and sighed, then looked down to see Cassidy still worrying about the sandwiches.</p>
