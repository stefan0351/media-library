	<chapter title="Chapter Sixteen">
		<p>It was next Friday. Crystal Bar was a medium sized location in the middle of the city. Its patrons were lesbians from other towns who would come in and dance or drink the night away with the sensuous and sometimes fast music. Its dance floor was in the center of the location, while the bar was all the way in the back; the high stools and tables were all around the wood dance floor. Track lights surrounded the hard wood dance floor; some lighting was around the domed mirrored ceiling. Tonight, the place was full; many were friends of Gretchen, others were admirers. All celebrated her victory in court.</p>
		<p>Not that this was a first win for her, everyone knew she'd won all her previous cases. It was that this was her first case in Hate Crimes. Usually, she'd done crimes against women in general, rapes, murder, etc. This case she worked on was a hate crime against her client, a young prominent lesbian woman who was beaten severely by three eighteen year old female high school students upon dropping off her girlfriend at work and kissing her openly. The three young women should have been in school, but instead, were walking around in the streets.</p>
		<p>They claimed to be disgusted and distraught when they saw this display of &#145;unnatural behavior,' as their lawyer described with oh, so much feeling. Of course, Gretchen countered that because what someone does with their business does not agree with their morals or opinions, they do not deserve to receive the treatment that her client received. Plus she threw in many more arguments, all plausible. In the end, each girl got four years in jail, plus probation afterward for two years. The slightest indiscretion would send them back to jail.</p>
		<p>So now Gretchen was dancing away with George, both looking sexy in their attire. Gretchen wearing a tight black dress that hugged her rounded seductive curves very attractively. George wore loose black slacks; a white shirt tucked snugly in, opened all the way down to mid belly. Her black hair was a little longer, curling back attractively. Ashleigh was there too, dancing with a particularly attractive young woman, one of many already there; looking gallant in brown slacks and V-neck sweater that complimented her long, lithe body. Robie stood in the back, a glass of Sex on the Beach in her slender hand; she wore a short red-silk slip of a dress that clung to her slim body perfectly.</p>
		<p>She was silently worried, waiting for Cassidy to arrive, her eyes shifting to the entrance from time to time. After the song ended and another one began, Ashleigh made her way to her, and noticed her worried frown. "Are you okay?" She asked, close to her ear. Robie nodded, and looked up to meet her eyes. She was very aware of Ashleigh's attractiveness. "Just a little worried about Cassidy and Andrea. Neither one has showed up yet." She said, looking into Ashleigh's eyes. Ashleigh hadn't noticed Robie's discomfort, and nodded. "You were the one who called Andrea, right?" She asked.</p>
		<p>Robie nodded, and caught sight of Andrea coming in through the doors, looking around the bar and catching her wave. Ashleigh caught sight of her and smiled as she jostled her way gingerly through the crowd. Andrea was beautiful with her long hair parted to the side, some falling over her smooth forehead. She wore black feminine slacks and a white soft V-neck shirt that hugged her breasts. Her makeup was applied softly, only a touch of blush and a light covering of lipstick. Both Ashleigh and Robie stared, entranced by her beauty, thinking that Cassidy could be incredibly stupid sometimes.</p>
		<p>Andrea smiled at them, her eyes wandering over the crowd of women. She was looking for Cassidy, and frowned softly when she didn't see her. "Cassidy here?" She asked over the music.</p>
		<p>"Not yet." Robie answered, and both caught sight of Cassidy striding through the doors.</p>
		<p>Andrea's breath caught in her throat as Cassidy's eyes met hers. Cassidy seemed flustered to see her there, and stood immobile, staring. Ashleigh couldn't mistake the look of intense love and desire going through Andrea's features and she followed her gaze, seeing the same look take over Cassidy's expression. Ashleigh gestured Cassidy over when she realized Cassidy was rooted to the spot she stood on. Cassidy, looking down, made her way through the crowd of women, catching the eye of many of them.</p>
		<p>When she stood in front of them, she studiously avoided any more eye contact with Andrea. After greeting Ashleigh and Robie with hugs and kisses, she stood awkwardly staring at the floor in front of her. Andrea took in her clothes, a brown gap sweater, and black slacks and loafers, and a stronger surge of desire overwhelmed her. "Hi," Andrea finally said, wanting to reach out and run her fingers through her hair, which was loose over her straight shoulders. "How are you?" She asked, moving closer, looking up at her face, and trying to force eye contact.</p>
		<p>Finally, Cassidy looked up; meeting her eyes bravely, she shrugged. She said unconvincingly: "Okay, I guess." She said. She realized Robie and Ashleigh had moved away, and looked around.</p>
		<p>"They're dancing." Andrea said, and lifted her hand to touch Cassidy's face softly.</p>
		<p>Cassidy trembled and closed her eyes, feeling the soft fingers touching her hot skin. She turned her face to press her lips against the silky skin of Andrea's palm. Andrea's breath caught as her smooth lips pressed against her palm. Her body igniting with a wave of passion. But then Cassidy stepped back and shoved her aching hands into her pockets again. She was fighting the urge to take Andrea into her arms. She loved her so much it hurt, and it killed her. </p>
		<p>Andrea stared at her, aching to kiss her.</p>
		<p>And then Gretchen and George were upon them, happy to see them. Hugs and kisses were traded all around. George offered Cassidy a drink, and both women made their way to the bar. While they waited for their drinks, George turned to Cassidy and stared at her intently. Cassidy kept her face studiously expressionless. "So how are you, mate?" George asked lightly, trying not to let her concern show through.</p>
		<p>Cassidy leaned closer. "I'm okay." She said.</p>
		<p>George didn't believe her for one second; she could see the weight loss, the extremely somber expression, and the depression. She was still so beautiful, though, despite the absent smile, and the thinness. Cassidy's Scotch and George's White Russian arrived. Cassidy downed her Scotch in one gulp, grimacing slightly, and gestured to the bartender for another one. George was astounded, and didn't know what to think. They walked back to their friends, not talking.</p>
		<p>Gretchen took the glass away from Cassidy, and pulled her towards the dance floor, winking at George. Cassidy didn't resist, and wrapped her arms around Gretchen's waist, pulling her comfortably close; she didn't want to look into her eyes. "Cassidy," Gretchen said into her ear as they moved to the music. "You can't lie to me. How are you?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy knew she couldn't lie to Gretchen, who knew her so well. So she didn't answer, closing her eyes tightly and burying her face into Gretchen's shoulder. Gretchen cradled her head with a hand, feeling tears come to her eyes, and sighing: "Oh, Cassidy, what are you doing to yourself, honey?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy shook her head and pulled back as the song ended. They returned to their crowd, and they began chatting. A young nubile thing, of about twenty-two, prettily blonde and luscious, flanked Gretchen's side, never taking her eyes off Cassidy. Andrea noticed, and a flash of jealousy flashed through her. She moved up close to Cassidy, slipping her hand through hers. Cassidy looked down at her with a confused expression, and Andrea whispered in her ear: "Dance with me."</p>
		<p>Cassidy was silent, but didn't resist when Andrea pulled Cassidy to the dance floor as a romantic song began blaring from the huge speakers. Everyone noticed the jealousy that flashed through Andrea, and glanced at each other with tiny smiles; the young woman asked Gretchen if that was Cassidy's lover; Gretchen didn't answer.</p>
		<p>Andrea wrapped her arms around Cassidy's neck, and pressed her body close to hers. She felt Cassidy's warm breath brushing against her forehead grow uneven, and pulled her even closer to herself. Cassidy slowly, and reluctantly, wrapped her arms around Andrea's small waist. Their bodies molded, melting together. They swayed slowly, sensuously to the music; their hips rocked together, creating body memory of their torrid lovemaking. Andrea gasped as a flash of heat began between her legs, and seemed to run through her. Her arms around Cassidy's neck tightened reflexively.</p>
		<p>Their cheeks pressed together; they lost themselves in the heat of their dance, their bodies reacting to one another with flashes of heat and wetness. Andrea ran her fingers through Cassidy's hair; she cupped her head, pulling back and pulling Cassidy's parted lips to her own. She kissed her fully, her mouth opening against hers. She felt Cassidy respond to her then, opening her own mouth and brushing her tongue against hers. Andrea groaned deep in her throat, and she heard Cassidy moan too. Cassidy insinuated a thigh between Andrea's legs, and moaned when Andrea kissed her throat passionately, moaning slightly against her skin, breathing hard.</p>
		<p>Everything and everyone around them disappeared, their passion instantly ignited. The music was their guide, their passion. Something in Cassidy broke and she pulled away with a sob. Andy moved up to her again, seeing all the emotions going through her features. Running a trembling hand over her tearing eyes, Cassidy shuddered. She broke away when Andy touched her cheek softly. Shaking her head, she backed away slowly, not meeting her pleading eyes.</p>
		<p>She left the bar in a hurry, and Andrea followed to stop her. But when she got outside, she looked up and down the street, and couldn't find her anywhere. She ran back inside, to retrieve her jacket. Gretchen stopped her with a hand on her arm. "Where did she go?' She demanded with a worried expression.</p>
		<p>Andrea wanted to be on her way, she wanted to find Cassidy as soon as possible; she had seemed so terribly upset. "I don't know, Gretchen." She said. "I'm going to go find her." She pulled away, not hearing Gretchen's reply.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Cassidy knocked on Josua's door, shoving her hands into her pockets nervously. She heard a sound from inside, and the door swung open. Josua was a little surprised at her presence, but he didn't hesitate to invite her in. The apartment was dark; the TV was now on mute, the images of Charlie's Angels moving around in the screen. Cassidy walked to the couch and flopped down onto it. Josua flopped down next to her, and looked at her sideways. "What's up?" He asked in friendly concern, noticing her distress.</p>
		<p>She'd been over to his apartment almost every night for the past two weeks, running lines with him, running away from the world.</p>
		<p>Cassidy glanced at him briefly, then looked down at her lap again. "Too many things." She said quietly, shaking her head slowly. She looked at him again, and met his eyes. "Got some more of that stuff?" She asked with an expressionless voice, her face unreadable. Josua stared at her for a long moment, and she stood abruptly. She made for the little bar behind the couch. She reached for the Johnny Walker, uncapping the bottle and gulping directly from it. She grimaced, shivering slightly as the hot liquid washed down her throat.</p>
		<p>She drank one mouthful after another, until the brand new bottle was halfway empty. In the meantime, Josua had fixed the white rocks into powder and then neatly separated them into lines. He pulled out the piece of straw from his little box kit, and handed it to Cassidy along with the mirror covered with seven lines of the white poison.</p>
		<p>Quickly, she inhaled a line, feeling the high rush to her head almost instantly. It felt stronger because of the alcohol already pumping through her. She inhaled another line, and the sharp bitter taste invaded her tongue. She breathed in deeply, closing her eyes. Her heart beat erratically, but she ignored it. Another thin line and she was ready to shoot through the roof. She liked this too much. Sensing that Cassidy wasn't about to share, Josua was getting some more ready for himself on another mirror he had, and was unaware that Cassidy was consuming too much of the cocaine, and too fast.</p>
		<p>By the time all the lines were inhaled, the coke-induced energy was running through her system at an unnatural pace. Her hands were trembling, her eyes blinking rapidly and narrowing. She stood up unsteadily, and grabbing the bottle of scotch, stumbled towards the door. She couldn't think, her heart beat wildly, her head felt like it was floating. She gulped the Scotch carelessly. The bottle dropped from her hands, it shattered on the floor. She turned to Josua and stared uncomprehendingly at him, he was lying back on the couch, relaxing after running a couple of lines, eyes closed and a smile on his lips. He didn't notice when she stumbled out the door.</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Seventeen">
		<p>Andrea was so worried; she stood pacing in front of Cassidy's building. She'd been knocking on her door for the past hour and a half, and decided to wait out front until Cassidy returned; she had left her own key that last day they'd been together. She kept running nervous hands through her hair; she was so worried and scared. She'd seen the way Cassidy looked after not seeing her all that time, and it was not good. She knew Cassidy was doing something unhealthy, and she wanted to stop her. But she didn't know where to find her.</p>
		<p>Andrea leaned against her car, staring up at the building. She tried to see any sign of movement inside Cassidy's window, thinking that maybe Cassidy was trying to avoid her. But no, there was nothing. She stood helplessly outside, feeling tears filling her eyes. She wondered why Cassidy was doing this to her, to herself, when they could just fall into each other's arms and be happy together. She loved Cassidy so much, was so in love with her. She was suffering. She didn't care if Cassidy didn't feel the same way towards her; she'd be willing to try to win her heart in any way she could.</p>
		<p>A movement caught her eye to her left, and she turned her eyes to the source. Cassidy. Stumbling up the block, trying to hold her own self up with a hand grabbing at fences, her feet dragged one after the other; her body leaned heavily against the fences. She was struggling noisily for breath, her eyelids fluttering, eyes rolling; she held a hand to her chest, grasping her shirt tightly, pulling at it. Andrea could see the sweat gathered thickly all over her forehead, could see the struggle to stay upright. A struggle that she was loosing.</p>
		<p>"Cassidy!" Andrea cried out as she ran to her side, and noticed with dismay the white powder lingering around her nostrils. "Oh God, no!"</p>
		<p>"Andy&#133;" Cassidy whispered brokenly. Then her eyes rolled in their sockets, and she tipped forward, falling to the cement, face forward with a loud thud.</p>
		<p>"Cassidy!" Andrea screamed, shaking her by the shoulder. She flipped her over and was horrified to see that the area around her lips was blue, a sign that she was already not breathing. With a cry, Andrea reached into her purse for her cellular and dialed 9-1-1.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Within minutes, an ambulance was there; the paramedics were working over Cassidy. They'd resuscitated her and were now readying her for a quick transportation to the hospital.</p>
		<p>Andrea sat nearby, sobbing desperately into the shoulder of a female neighbor of Cassidy's.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Ashleigh, Robie, Gretchen and George sat having a very early breakfast in a nearby restaurant. Gretchen was telling them what she'd seen in the bar, when Cassidy had run out on Andrea. They'd been there, waiting to hear from Andrea about Cassidy. Robie stared at the table pensively, while the others talked quietly. Around a mouthful of egg sandwich, George said with finality: "Let's go to Cassidy's place, we're wasting time here."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh agreed and all four women stood up, while at the same time George signaled for the ticket. The ring of Ashleigh's cellular telephone jarred them momentarily. Crisply, Ashleigh answered. "We have one of your patients here, Doctor Simmons." A nurse at her hospital replied after introducing herself. "Not in very good condition, ma'am. Critical."</p>
		<p>"Name?" Ashleigh demanded, dread a bad feeling at the pit of her full stomach. She was already striding out of the restaurant, Robie and Gretchen following; George remained behind to pay the bill.</p>
		<p>The nurse remained impersonal; the sound of shuffling papers annoying as she looked for the name. "The name is Cassidy Monsignor." She finally answered.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh's step faltered, and she tried to remain matter of fact. "Give me details." She ordered, her voice thick, unlocking the doors to her black Saab quickly, climbing in.</p>
		<p>The nurse reported, reading from the papers: "Overdose on Cocaine, was brought in after a pulmonary arrest&#133;"</p>
		<p>Ashleigh closed her eyes against the anxiety the report conjured, one hand gripping the steering wheel tightly. Gretchen and Robie knew something was up, and they didn't allow her to close her door yet. George had joined them and demanded to know what was going on. As the nurse finished her report, Ashleigh said: "Ill be there in ten minutes." And hung up, looking up at her friends with expressionless eyes. "Get in." She instructed softly.</p>
		<p>"What is it?" Gretchen demanded, while at the same time all of them were climbing into the black Saab, George in the front and the rest in the back.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh started the car, and drove quickly out of the restaurant's parking lot. She remained quiet, concentrating on the road. "Ashleigh," George said softly. "Tell us what's going on. Is it Cassidy?"</p>
		<p>Ashleigh nodded slowly, and bit her lower lip. "She's in the hospital again." She said wearily, shaking her head slowly, hearing Gretchen's breath catch from behind her. "Overdosed on coke."</p>
		<p>A sudden outburst from George startled them all; she pounded on the headboard wildly, cursing. Suddenly, she stopped, staring out the windshield. "Damn it!" She yelled, pounding again on the headboard. "Is she alive?" She asked, suddenly calm, slouching on her seat.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh nodded yes as she made a right on that last street before the hospital. "Pulmonary arrest." She replied. "She's in critical condition."</p>
		<p>"Who found her?" Gretchen asked quietly.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh searched the rearview mirror for Robie, who seemed at a loss of words and close to tears. She sighed. "I don't know." She said. She pulled into the emergency room parking lot, and stopped the car, glancing at George. "Park it, will you?" She said, and didn't wait for an answer, jumping out and running towards the entrance. She caught sight of Andrea as she ran up towards the entrance to the restricted area of the emergency area.</p>
		<p>Andrea saw her with tearful, red-rimmed eyes, and stood up from the chair she was huddling on. She stared after her as Ashleigh acknowledged her with a perfunctory nod. She strode in through the heavy double doors to the emergency room. The head doctor of the emergency room, a stocky gray haired man in his forties, greeted her, already knowing that she was coming in. He pulled her towards the area Cassidy was in as she donned the scrubs. "How's she holding up, Marco?" She demanded.</p>
		<p>"Stable now, Ashleigh, but very critical." He replied; his voice was expressionless. "I know she's a personal friend of yours, and that you're her doctor as well, but you need to be practical. Okay?" Ashleigh nodded. "Because you see, we did some blood work, and this woman consumed enough cocaine for about three people. It must have been in the process of about one hour or less. Whoever provided her with this poison, must have wanted her dead or been in a high of his or her own, to let her consume so much."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh nodded as he guided her to the compartment in which they'd accommodated Cassidy. Ashleigh sighed at the sight of her friend, who looked worse now than when she'd been there the last time. She had respiratory help, a thick tube taped to her cheek and going in through her mouth; it guided the oxygen into her lungs from its connection to a machine, making her weakened lungs inhale and exhale. An IV line ran from her right arm, connected to a bag of feed for her system; another was connected to her other wrist, a solution to clean the filth in her blood. Ashleigh stepped up close to the stretcher, and looked her friend and patient over.</p>
		<p>Cassidy was so thin, so pale and bluish. Ashleigh knew that she'd had a close call, and that she was still close. Cassidy's chest rose and fell shallowly, letting her know that her lungs were weak, and that they weren't responding on their own, that the machine was necessary. "Any brain damage?" She asked evenly.</p>
		<p>Doctor Marco Estevez sighed. "None that we can see yet." He said softly. "But we can't say, at least until she wakes. She hadn't been breathing for about two minutes by the time the paramedics arrived; it took them another couple of minutes to bring her lungs around to at least draw in <i>some</i> oxygen. They assisted her all the way here."</p>
		<p>"Who called in for the ambulance?" Ashleigh asked, touching Cassidy's forehead softly. It was cold and clammy.</p>
		<p>"A young woman sitting outside. I thought you'd know her, since she was the one who gave us all the information about you being her doctor." Marco Estevez replied calmly.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh nodded, staring at Cassidy's beautiful still face. "Well," She said slowly, trying to control her voice. "I guess there's nothing for me to do right now." She looked at him with a grateful expression. "I'd like to see tonight's chart, and I'll take over her care from here." She extended her hand for a shake and he shook it. "Thanks, Marco, I really appreciate your help."</p>
		<p>He smiled at her reassuringly. "She'll come out of this one, Ashleigh. Don't worry." He said.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh nodded, and went to the nurse's desk, where she was handed new green scrubs and her stethoscope from her locker. "Thank you," She said briskly.</p>
		<p>After changing, she returned to the waiting room, where she found Gretchen, George, and Robie flanking Andrea's side. Andrea was shaking her head, tears ran down her cheeks, her eyes were closed tightly. Robie caught sight of Ashleigh from the corner of her eye, and half turned to face her, demanding with her eyes. Ashleigh's somber expression scared her, and she shook her head, whispering: "No."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh smiled reassuringly. "No," She said firmly. "She's alive, don't worry. And I'm doing my best to keep it that way." She reached out and squeezed Robie's shoulder gently. She continued to Andrea's side, sitting beside her when George moved from the seat. Andrea looked at her with pleading eyes. Ashleigh wrapped her arm around her shoulder, pulling her close. "It seems you keep finding yourself in situations with Cassidy that require a hospital." She whispered gently, smiling sympathetically.</p>
		<p>Andrea nodded slowly, sobbing softly. "Ashleigh, she's killing me!" She rocked herself slowly, her arms wrapped around herself. George kneeled in front of her, taking her hands and squeezing softly. Andrea gasped as more tears ran down her cheeks. "Why is she doing this to herself? Why?"</p>
		<p>Ashleigh tried to hold back tears of frustration. "I don't know." She said softly, holding Andrea tightly. "I really can't explain Cassidy, Andrea. But I promise this; she will go to psychiatrist once she comes out of here. I'm not letting her out of this hospital unless she complies, and that will be that."</p>
		<p>George stood up abruptly, her movements suddenly harsh and angry. "Ashleigh," She said softly. "May I speak with you?"</p>
		<p>Ashleigh stood up, letting Robie take her place, and walked a few feet away with George. Gretchen followed, and George took her hand. George said: "The question we have to ask is who gave her this poison."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh could see her strain for control by the way her jaw clenched and unclenched tightly. She nodded, and glanced at Gretchen. Gretchen was nodding her agreement, one arm twining around her lover's. Ashleigh sighed. "I have an idea as to who might have provided her with the drug." She said softly.</p>
		<p>George's eyes hardened. "Who?" She demanded, clenching her fist.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh looked down. "She has a friend, named Josua, he&#133; ah," She hesitated. "He's a heavy coke addict, <i>really</i> into it. She's been trying to get him to stop for years. And you know she hasn't been exactly herself lately, she might not have refused if offered enough." She was pensive, and slipped her hands deep into the pockets of her pant scrubs.</p>
		<p>George made eye contact with Gretchen, then looked back at Ashleigh. "Where does he live?" She demanded of her.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh took a deep breath. "He lives on Monroe Street, a couple of blocks down from Cassidy's apartment. His building is Hastings Courts." She said, not wanting to know what George's intention was.</p>
		<p>George nodded. "What apartment?" She asked.</p>
		<p>"I don't know." Ashleigh shrugged. "His name is Josua Maldonado."</p>
		<p>George's lips pursed. "Perfect." She said. She reached into her jacket pocket for her pen, taking a paper from Ashleigh's pad. She wrote down a number. "This is my beeper number, Ashleigh. Beep me if anything. I'm taking your car." She handed her the paper, and walked to the exit, Gretchen with her.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Eighteen">
		<p>Josua was nodding off slouched on his couch, his chin pressed against his chest; a sliver of saliva slithered out of his parted mouth onto the front of his shirt, his feet rested on his coffee table. He was startled when a knock sounded at his door, jumping and blinking rapidly in his shock. He stood up unsteadily, and stumbled to the door. He yanked open the door, and barely saw who stood there before he felt the sharp painful blast of a fist in the middle of his face. He flew backwards, arms and limbs flailing, landing on his ass.</p>
		<p>Strong steps followed him, and he cried out, covering his bloody face. "No!"</p>
		<p>"You bastard!" A woman with a strong Australian accent sputtered, and he felt a sharp kick to his stomach.</p>
		<p>"Ugh!" He groaned, trying to protect himself with his arms. "What the fuck! You broke my <i>nose</i>!" He moaned, feeling the blood gush from his nose.</p>
		<p>"You fucking bastard! I'll kill you!" The same voice roared. A hand grasped his shirt and pulled him up with surprising strength. Through the haze of pain, he could see his attacker. She was staring down at him with angry blue eyes.</p>
		<p>Gretchen, who hadn't had time to stop her lover, grasped her jacket sleeve and pleaded with her to stop. George was out of control in her anger, and she'd kill Josua if Gretchen weren't there. "George, please." She said softly, and watched as George paused, glaring at Josua.</p>
		<p>And then suddenly, she dropped him heavily, kicking him hard in the stomach. Josua groaned, and vomited all over the floor. George grimaced at the stench; Gretchen gagged and turned away. Despite the rancid odor, George kneeled beside him, staring at his bloody face impassively. Evenly, in a deadly calm voice, she said: "You so much as ever, and hear me again, <i>ever</i> go near Cassidy Monsignor with your garbage, I will break much more than your nose."</p>
		<p>Josua shivered with fear, and vomited all over again. George jumped back, out of the flow's way, and glared at him for another minute. Then she turned away and guided Gretchen out of the apartment.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>When they returned to the hospital, they found Jeffrey there with Andrea. With a small groan, George walked inside with Gretchen. Robie stood close by Andrea and Jeffrey, seriously glaring at Jeffrey's back. Jeffrey pointedly ignored her, and was having a quiet discussion with Andrea. She wouldn't look at him, and seemed extremely angry, though she was trying hard to control it.</p>
		<p>Robie moved to George and Gretchen's side as they walked in, muttering under her breath. She took in the spatters of blood on George's jacket and skin, and then calmly studied George's impassive face. "What did you do?" She asked softly.</p>
		<p>George shook her head in a don't-ask-any-questions way. "Nothing." She replied shortly, then glanced in Andrea's direction. "What's up?" She asked.</p>
		<p>Robie turned to glare at Jeffrey, who glanced up at her and returned the glare. "This guy is one true bastard!" She whispered vehemently. "He calls Andrea at her cellular, wants to know where she is. When she tells him where and why she's here, he asks her to come home. But of course Andrea said no, and how dare he expect her to leave Cassidy, who needs her so much.</p>
		<p>"So he shows up here, and fumes when he finds my arms around her, ranting about how she's turning into 'one of those women.' And then he goes and says that Cassidy probably has AIDS and all this crap." She crossed her arms and tapped her foot in a fast pace, shaking her head. "Andrea practically told him to fuck off when he said that, and that's when he just shut up and started talking to her really quiet." She smiled slightly; very amused at the insults Andrea threw his way.</p>
		<p>Gretchen chuckled, and George smiled despite her anger. "Any news on Cassidy?" She asked.</p>
		<p>Robie shook her head, her smile faded. "Ashleigh said she is in a coma." She said softly; Gretchen and George murmured and gasped their fear. "They're taking her to a room in ICU in about an hour or so."</p>
		<p>Gretchen pursed her lips thoughtfully. "She hasn't responded to anything?" She asked.</p>
		<p>Robie shook her head. "Nothing, still the same." She said softly, her voice betraying her worry.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>"Andy," Jeffrey was saying softly, trying not to explode on her. "Come home with me, baby. You're so tired." He was trying to cajole her. She would have none of it, and insisted on not looking at him. He knew he'd made a mistake the moment he yelled those bitter words against Cassidy. As much as he suspected of her sexual involvement with Cassidy, he knew he shouldn't have said a word; he didn't want to loose her. Now she didn't want him to even touch her. He sat beside her, knees pressed against hers; hands clasped in front of him, trying to soft-talk her.</p>
		<p>She stared blankly away from him, occasionally glancing at Robie, Gretchen and George. Andrea thought that Cassidy didn't appreciate her friends. She thought if she was so depressed, so tempted to go into the dark world of drugs, why didn't she talk about it? But it was no time for recriminations, Cassidy might die, and she wouldn't know what to do if she did. She trembled violently, and looked down at her hands resting helplessly on her lap; tears sprang to her eyes.</p>
		<p>"Ah, Andy," Jeffrey whispered, and made a move to hold her.</p>
		<p>Andrea pushed him away. "Get away from me!" She hissed, not able to control her contempt against Jeffrey. "I don't need you here, really." She whispered, trying to be nicer this time. "Just go home."</p>
		<p>Jeffrey shook his head, and glanced at the three women standing close. He wouldn't leave her around these women at any time. "No, I can't leave you here, baby."</p>
		<p>Andrea decided to ignore him, then. She stood up resolutely and went to Robie and the others. Ashleigh came in a few minutes later, and Andrea went to her. Ashleigh smiled down at her, touching her cheek comfortingly. "She's in the Intensive Care room now." She said to them, noticing Jeffrey sitting calmly by the chairs, and her expression hardened visibly. He leered at her, and waved slightly, knowing her dislike towards him. She looked at Andrea, and said: "You should go home and rest now. You've had a hard night." She looked at the others. "The same goes for you too."</p>
		<p>Andrea shook her head, but before she could audibly protest, George said: "She's right, Andrea. You look extremely tired."</p>
		<p>"Thank you." Andrea said, and yawned. "You're right." She looked at Ashleigh. "I'll be here first thing in the morning. Call me if anything comes up, please."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh nodded. "Visiting hours from nine to eight." She informed her, and smiled reassuringly. "But maybe I can arrange something."</p>
		<p>Andrea nodded and smiled warily in return and said goodnight to everyone. She then glanced fleetingly at Jeffrey and said: "I have my own car, Jeffrey. I don't need you to take me home. Goodnight." And she walked out, Jeffrey close at her heels, trying to cajole her into changing her mind.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh, George, Gretchen and Robie were very amused at Andrea's sudden change in attitude towards Jeffrey. It seemed she'd seen what he was really all about, and could barely stand his company now.</p>

		<p>Cassidy remained the same, unresponsive. Her lungs were still weak, would not operate on their own. Tests showed that the excessive consumption of the drug impeded the air sacks from expanding and contracting like normal air sacks do; sort of like a severe asthma attack. They knew there was no brain damage, at least none of it that they could see; they couldn't for the life of them figure out why she was still unconscious. But Ashleigh was not about to give up.</p>
		<p>The first day she brought Andrea in to see her, she'd stood next to her, gazing at Cassidy's still figure. Andrea's hands shook, and her lips did too, tears filled her eyes. She bent down to gaze at her face, smoothing Cassidy's hair back from her forehead. She kissed Cassidy's forehead softly as Ashleigh watched, kissing her way gently across. "Cassidy," She whispered softly against her ear, her hand trailing up along her smooth arms. "Wake up, please."</p>
		<p>But Cassidy didn't respond, remaining as she was, not even her eyelids flickered. The respiratory machine was providing the only sign of life in the room. Pale, drawn, Andrea struggled against tears. She turned to Ashleigh and grasped her arms. "What if she dies?" Ashleigh shook her head and began to speak, but Andrea went on. "What am I going to do then? What! I love her, Ashleigh!" And she broke into sobs, pressing her face onto her shoulder.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh sighed, and wrapped her arms around Andrea. "Shhh." She whispered. "Let's not get ahead of ourselves. I told you I'd do my best, Andy."</p>
		<p>Andrea nodded slowly, pulling away. "You <i>are</i> doing your best, Ashleigh. But she's the same, she won't wake up."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh looked away from Andrea's eyes. "She's in a coma, but I haven't given up hope, and neither should you."</p>
		<p>Chided, Andrea turned around to look at Cassidy again. Bending close again, she kissed her forehead tenderly and continued to murmur sweet things close to her ear, trying to give her a reason to wake.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>George and Gretchen hesitated at the door of Cassidy's hospital room, but then Ashleigh glanced up from her clipboard and gestured them in. "How is she?" George asked quietly, standing by the bed and touching Cassidy's hair with a hand. Ashleigh smiled slightly, glancing down at her clipboard again.</p>
		<p>"Well, the cells in her lungs are regenerating at a very good pace, so the tissues in her lungs are strengthening." She grinned with hope. "Soon, she won't need respiratory aid at all."</p>
		<p>Gretchen and George smiled at each other, and then at Ashleigh. Ashleigh's smile faded as she continued: "She's still in a coma, though. They found a little something else in her system. Extreme levels of alcohol in her blood also. The drug completely clashed with the alcohol, and her system obviously could not take it, her lungs least of all. But we've done a cleansing of her system, which is why she has the other IV on the other arm. Now we can give her some medicine."</p>
		<p>Gretchen and George both frowned; they'd only heard the part about the coma, nothing else mattered. When Robie told them, they had decided not to believe her, thinking she was too upset. But hearing it from Ashleigh was a whole different thing. "Coma?" Gretchen repeated.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh nodded, but smiled at them. "She'll be okay, she only needs time."</p>
		<p>"Wait until Andrea hears that she'll get better." Gretchen beamed, not wanting to think of the bad things about Cassidy's situation; she turned to kiss George softly on the lips. "I have to go back to the office for a couple of hours, honey. Will you be here later on?" She asked.</p>
		<p>George nodded. When Gretchen left, George to one long look at Cassidy's seemingly sleeping features and then another long look at Ashleigh, who looked like she hadn't slept well in days. "You haven't rested in four days since Cassidy was brought in, Ash. You look like shit." She said.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh mock glared at George, who looked suitably sheepish. She laughed suddenly, saying: "Thanks for the opinion. It's just that I don't want to leave Cassidy's side until I know she's out of the roughhouse. I catch a few winks in the doctor's lounge."</p>
		<p>George glanced at Cassidy. "Have you even washed your teeth?" She asked. "Jesus, I don't even want to stand near you, you'd probably kill me!"</p>
		<p>Ashleigh poked the pen in her direction. "Keep trying me, George," She said mock-sternly. "I can have you barred from this hospital this second, and your lawyer girlfriend won't help you." She walked over to Cassidy, placing the stethoscope into her ears, reaching with the other end beneath the covers.</p>
		<p>George lifted her hands up in a peace gesture, laughing. "Okay, okay. Sorry doc." She said, suppressing laughter. She watched seriously as Ashleigh listened to Cassidy's heartbeat and lungs with her stethoscope, placing it in different locations, nodding with satisfaction. "What?" George asked.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh reached into her scrub pants pockets, pulling out a penlight. "Her heart sounds good, and so do her lungs." She explained. Peeling back her eyelid, she directed the little beam of light at each pupil. Both dilated perfectly. "Her eyes respond." She checked the taped tube inserted into her mouth, making sure that no rashes were developing. The tapes were changed every day to prevent settling for rashes. She stood up straight, and smiled at George reassuringly. She wrote into the clipboard, and said: "I have to go check on another patient, and then I'll be back." She placed the clipboard on the bedside table and walked out of the room with a last smile at George.</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty">
		<p>Andrea sat down at her desk and began writing distractedly into her notebook. She was supposed to be writing a few notes on the next day's class, but she couldn't concentrate; her thoughts were on Cassidy, and she was worrying. Her phone rang, shaking her out of her thoughtful stupor. She picked it up and said shakily: "Hello?"</p>
		<p>"Hi." It was Jeffrey. "How are you?"</p>
		<p>Andrea sighed. "I'm fine, and you?" She replied; her voice was impersonal.</p>
		<p>Jeffrey felt sad; he missed her a lot. He sat behind his own desk, a pencil in his clenched fist. "Can we have dinner?" He asked shyly. He knew he'd lost her, but he wasn't ready to give up yet.</p>
		<p>Andrea sighed again, and said softly: "I have to go the hospital to see Cassidy. I don't know what time I'll be available." She didn't know how to just break it off with him, how to tell him it was done with between them.</p>
		<p>Jeffrey's eyes closed tightly and he clasped the pen until it broke in half. "Andrea, please." He spoke through clenched teeth. "Why are you doing this to us, why?" He pleaded, trying to control his voice.</p>
		<p>Andrea sat back on her chair, feeling so sad too, because she cared for him, but not in the way he cared for her. She didn't know how to tell him. "Things are not the same, you said a lot of things I didn't appreciate, especially when I needed you to support me about Cassidy." She said, trying not to let her anger surface. "You knew I love her. I love her so much, and that I was worrying, and you kept giving me a hard time about wanting to stay by her side."</p>
		<p>Jeffrey felt a lone tear trickle down his cheek. He felt like a total idiot. "You don't just love her, Andrea." He said brokenly.</p>
		<p>Andrea closed her eyes tightly, she held tightly onto the phone until her knuckles ached. "You're right." She whispered. "I'm in love with her."</p>
		<p>Jeffrey couldn't control it any longer. "How did this <i>happen</i>?" He cried out, slamming his fist on the table. "You didn't feel <i>that</i> way last month, how did that happen?"</p>
		<p>"We shouldn't talk on the phone about this, Jeffrey." She said softly. "I'll call you back."</p>
		<p>"Wait!" Jeffrey pleaded, but Andrea had already hung up.</p>
		<p>Andrea sat quietly on her desk, and her phone rang again. "Hello?" She said a little impatiently, thinking it was Jeffrey.</p>
		<p>"How are you?" It was Carey.</p>
		<p>"Hi, Carey. I'm fine, worrying like hell. And you?" Andrea responded, happy to hear from her.</p>
		<p>"I'm fine." Carey replied with her short sentences. "Been talking with Roseanne."</p>
		<p>Andrea smiled softly. "I see she's told you I haven't been myself, right?" She asked.</p>
		<p>"Yes," Carey said with a smile. "But it has gotten along the lesbian grapevine that Cassidy is in the hospital, in critical condition." She paused. "Nice of you to call me and let me know, Andrea."</p>
		<p>Andrea sighed. "I'm sorry," She said sincerely. "It's just that so many things have been happening. I go from school to the hospital, and then home to check homework and then to sleep."</p>
		<p>"I understand, Andrea." Carey said. "So how is she?" She asked with concern.</p>
		<p>Andrea shook her head and struggled against instant tears. "I can hardly handle it." She said brokenly.</p>
		<p>"Hey," Carey said softly. "Just take it easy, things will work out, don't worry. Are you going to see her today?"</p>
		<p>"Of course." Andrea said softly. "Why don't you come with me, Carey?"</p>
		<p>"Sure, I'd like to give a piece of my mind to Cassidy, maybe she'll decide to wake up and claim what is hers." Carey said with a laugh. Then she paused, and said: "Might that be you?"</p>
		<p>Andrea couldn't help but laugh. "Of course." She said, leaning back and relaxing on the chair. "I just hope she sees it too."</p>
		<p>Carey laughed again. "Okay, great." She said in her rouged Irish accent. "I'll come pick you up after I pick Roseanne up. I'll take her to eat something; I want to have a chat with her. Then we'll come back and get you about a half hour later."</p>
		<p>"What do you want to talk to her about, if you don't mind me asking?" Andrea inquired with a smile. She liked the way Carey was close to Roseanne, the way she felt confident about talking to her of anything.</p>
		<p>"I want to talk to her about those two girls she's seeing and what she is going to do about them." Carey replied, laughing softly at her daughter's predicament.</p>
		<p>Andrea sighed. "Sometimes I regret telling you about the whole thing, Carey." She said, and laughed softly too.</p>
		<p>Carey laughed. "Hey! It is your duty as her teacher and my friend to tell me the secrets that I don't know about my daughter's life in school." She joked. "So, pick you up at three thirty?"</p>
		<p>"Perfect." Andrea said.</p>
		<p>"Okay," Carey said, smiling. "See you later today."</p>
		<p>"Okay, bye." Andrea said, and hung up, feeling much better.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Robie peeked into Cassidy's room before she walked in. She'd taken her lunch hour and driven to the hospital, like she'd been doing the past week. Cassidy lay in the room alone, the sound of the heart monitor and respiratory machine the only sounds in the otherwise silent room. Robie closed the door softly, and walked slowly towards the bed. She stood studying Cassidy's still features for a few minutes; she looked at the long hair pulled together into a braid. Then she leaned down and kissed her forehead softly.</p>
		<p>"Hi," She said softly, sitting down at the edge of the already available chair and placing her hand over Cassidy's. "I just thought I'd come and see you on my lunch hour, and talk to you a little. I miss you, Cassidy, we all miss you."</p>
		<p>She studied Cassidy's profile, her smooth eyelids, and the long curving eyelashes that pressed on her cheeks. The perfect nose, the full parted lips with the tube going through them. "You know," Robie continued softly. "I think you're running away from everything. I mean, I know that you're ill, but you don't have to worry us so much. Andrea loves you, Cassidy, and I mean she's <i>really</i> in love with you.</p>
		<p>"And what have you been doing?" She said, her voice growing impatient. "You've been doing your best to sabotage your possible relationship with her. God, you guys would be <i>perfect</i> together, and you're fucking that up, my friend. I think you need to wake up and smell the coffee, honey, I think you need to claim what belongs to you. And that, my dear, is Andrea's heart."</p>
		<p>She stopped, seeing a slight movement beneath Cassidy's lids, as if the balls of her eyes had moved. "Cassidy?" She said hesitantly, wrapping her hand around Cassidy's. "Cassidy." She felt a slight squeeze around her hand. "Oh God!" Robie stood up, looking down at Cassidy's face, trying to discern any movement. Yes! Cassidy's eyelids fluttered softly. "Please, yes, come back, Cassidy, please!" Tears sprang to her eyes as she watched Cassidy struggle to open her eyes.</p>
		<p>With her other hand, Robie reached overhead and pressed on the emergency button that would notify Ashleigh of any problems. But this wasn't a problem; this was the best thing that could be happening. "Come on, open your eyes, honey. I'm right here, baby." She urged softly.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Cassidy tried to shake her head, but was unable to. She was surrounded by darkness, and she wanted to get out. Robie's voice was far away, guiding her towards consciousness. Her throat ached and her eyes wouldn't open. She tightened her hand around Robie's hand, and though she could barely feel it, she knew it was there. She heard a soft sob, and then: "Oh, God, yes, yes!"</p>
		<p>Her eyes rolled, her eyelids fluttered, and opened. The light made her eyes ache, her lids half closed. She clenched her eyes closed again, and opened them slowly, feeling the glare of the overhead light burn them. She stared straight up at the ceiling, disoriented, dizzy. "Cassidy, look at me, baby, please." The pleading voice came from her right side, and she turned her head a little that way. Her eyelids fluttered again and she looked directly at Robie. "Yes, look at me." Robie was saying. Cassidy could see the tears streaming down her pretty cheeks, and a tear of her own leaked out of her eye.</p>
		<p>"What's going on?" Cassidy jumped with a jerk at the sound of Ashleigh's voice, but she could not move her head anymore to look. She remained staring at Robie, and then felt a strong hand holding her left hand. She heard a sob by her left ear, the voice deeper and stronger. "Cassidy, oh God!" And then she felt soft lips touching her forehead tenderly. "Look at me now, Cassidy." The voice pleaded, and Cassidy closed her eyes softly, recognizing the voice.</p>
		<p>She tried to move her mouth, but found that could not, that something thick was between her lips and teeth. She bit into it, and realized it was hard and tubular. Other than the slight ache in her throat, it didn't bother her. Turning her head only slightly, she made her eyes move from Robie and go to the other side. "Yes," Ashleigh said softly. Looking deeply into Cassidy's eyes, she allowed her emotions to show; tears ran down her cheeks heavily. "Hi, baby, we've missed you."</p>
		<p>Cassidy couldn't control her emotions, hot tears slid down her temples, and her body shook softly as she cried. She clenched her eyes closed, and cried for real. She was glad to be back, the darkness she'd endured had been comfortable, but it didn't supply the comfort only her friends could give. She missed them, and wanted to come back. She'd been struggling to return from her state of coma, but had found that she couldn't. She'd heard her friends there, talking to her, talking to each other. She was glad they'd been there. She couldn't remember the reason she was in the hospital. She didn't remember anything since walking out on Andrea at the bar.</p>
		<p><i>Andrea.</i></p>
		<p>She wondered where she was, wanted to see her so badly. She missed her and loved her, knowing she'd been stupid, like Robie implied, and that she wanted Andrea beside her. She wondered idly how long she'd been in the hospital.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh was bending over her, smoothing back her hair. Cassidy looked into her eyes and saw her love, her friendship there. She wanted to talk, and bit down on the tube again, making a slight noise. Ashleigh, whose face was close to Cassidy's, saw the movement of her jaw. "We'll take this out soon, honey, don't bite it." She said softly, tapping on the tube very softly with an index finger.</p>
		<p>Cassidy closed her eyes softly, and straightened her head, feeling very tired. She fell asleep quickly, feeling comforted by Ashleigh's hand smoothing her hair away from her forehead.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Outside in the hallway, Robie threw herself into Ashleigh's arms and cried with happiness. "Oh, Ashleigh," She gasped, the tears trickling down her cheeks and staining Ashleigh's scrub shirt. "Thank you, thank you!" She whispered softly, feeling Ashleigh's strong arms enfold her.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh tried not to feel nervous at the feel of Robie's voluptuous body pressing dangerously against hers. Her body responded; a chill ran up and down her spine, but she fought the sexual urge Robie's body awakened. "Don't thank me, Robie, thank God." She said softly, her voice trembling slightly. She'd been fighting her interest in Robie, knowing a little of her history. She knew that Robie had been in a relationship for a long time and that she still carried a torch for this woman, because they hadn't ended in a bad way. It was a mutual decision.</p>
		<p>So Ashleigh had no way of being with Robie in a love kind of way. The way she suspected she wanted Robie, despite the fact that they hardly knew each other. She ran her fingers through Robie's hair, pulling her face close to her shoulder.</p>
		<p>Robie's hands pressed flat against Ashleigh's back, she was suddenly very aware of Ashleigh's firm body pressed against hers. She pulled back, and looked up at Ashleigh, meeting her eyes. She felt a shiver run through her body when she saw the look in Ashleigh's green eyes. It was a look of unmistakable desire that Ashleigh was struggling to control. Robie moved her hands up along her shoulders and cupped her head, sifting her fingers through the soft short hair. "You're very attractive, Ashleigh." Robie whispered softly, knowing the truth of her growing attraction to Ashleigh.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh swallowed deeply, her eyes trailing from Robie's eyes to her lips. Lips that were thick and pouted slightly at the bottom. "I-" She tried to say, her voice broke. Robie didn't give her chance to continue as she pulled her head down and kissed her softly. Ashleigh groaned softly, and kissed her back tentatively, but when Robie inserted her tongue deep into her mouth, she couldn't help but respond. So they stood in the hall, kissing deeply, for a very long time. A nurse, on her way to Cassidy's room for a routine checkup, grinned and coughed politely and pointedly. She stepped inside the room with a smile on her face.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh and Robie practically jerked away from each other in shock; their cheeks flushed red. They stared at each other with wide, surprised eyes, not knowing what to say. Robie could see her lipstick smudged all over Ashleigh's sensuous lips, and couldn't help but want to kiss her again. She moved forward again, and Ashleigh did too, putting a hand softly on her shoulder, then cupping her neck tenderly. Robie shivered, closing her eyes tightly at the feeling of desire that coursed through her body. She could practically feel Ashleigh's lips on hers once again, but they never came.</p>
		<p>"Robie," Ashleigh said softly instead, and Robie thought with disappointment she would be rejected. "I'd like to know you better, because I've had a crush on you for the longest time." She smiled down at Robie, looking into her eyes.</p>
		<p>Robie beamed, and grinned up at Ashleigh. "I've had a crush on you too," She said softly, her eyes taking in Ashleigh's strong features and moving down and taking in the muscular, lithe body. "When can we have dinner, Ashleigh?" She asked breathlessly, meeting Ashleigh's eyes.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh laughed softly, and shook her head. "If I knew it would be this easy," She said softly, pulling her a little closer. "I wouldn't have been struggling so hard to control myself." She chuckled.</p>
		<p>Robie feigned feeling indignant, crossing her arms over her beautiful chest and mock glaring up at Ashleigh. "Oh, so now I'm easy." She said.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh threw her hands up in a peace gesture, shaking her head. "Hey, I didn't <i>say</i> that now." She said with a chuckle. She moved closer again, and tilted Robie's head with a long finger under her chin. "You're not easy at all, Robie." She whispered, and leaned closer to kiss her softly on the lips. "Now, about that dinner," She said softly, looking into her eyes. "As soon as we have Cassidy under control." She laughed. "She has one big family, and we all need to set her straight. You know?"</p>
		<p>"Well we don't want Cassidy straight now, do we?" Robie kidded, laughing throatily. Ashleigh joined in her laughter. But then she nodded in agreement, and smiled sensuously up at Ashleigh. "We'll have fun, Ashleigh." She promised in a low voice, lifting a finger and teasing the cleft on Ashleigh's chin. She chuckled sensuously when Ashleigh blushed deeply from her throat to her hairline. Then she took a deep sobering breath and sighed. "I can't wait to see Andrea's face." Both women went back into Cassidy's room; Ashleigh wrapped her arm around Robie's waist.</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-One">
		<p>George was bent over the crying Cassidy, her lips pressed against her forehead softly. She was crying softly, the tears dripping onto her friend's forehead as she whispered softly: "I'm so happy, Cassidy, you don't know how happy I am right now." She kept saying this over and over again. She'd received the call about two hours before when Robie had tearfully called her with the news. She had abandoned whatever she had been doing, working on a design, and left her home office in a hurry.</p>
		<p>On her way over to the hospital, George called Gretchen from her car phone, and left a message. Gretchen was in the courthouse across the street from her office, working on a case. She also tried to call Andrea, but there was no answer from her cellular. A given, since George knew that she would be in class, but she tried nevertheless. She left a message in the mailbox at the school and continued on her way to the hospital.</p>
		<p>What she found was a completely conscious Cassidy; laying with eyes wide open, listening to Robie talk to her and responding with little gestures of her hands. She couldn't control the tears that flooded her eyes, and rushed over to the bed.</p>
		<p>Presently, she was passing her hand softly over her hair, speaking to her softly. Cassidy's eyes opened, and George wiped away the tears that had traveled down her temples. "Are you okay? Do you feel okay?" She asked in frantic whispering. Cassidy's golden brown eyes met hers and she blinked a yes. George turned towards Robie with wide questioning eyes. "When is Ashleigh taking this thing off her?" She demanded in her Australian accent, pointing at the tube going into Cassidy's mouth.</p>
		<p>Robie smiled at George's impatience and informed her. "This evening, she thinks that maybe now that Cassidy's conscious, her lungs will be able to hold their own. She checked her out, and they sound strong, her breathing is not shallow any more." She explained with a smile. She'd taken the rest of the day off when Cassidy had woken, and stayed with her since.</p>
		<p>George turned back to Cassidy and smiled tenderly at her. "You know," She said softly. "You are one stupid bitch."</p>
		<p>Cassidy closed her eyes, wanting to laugh, but she knew she'd choke if she did. Robie laughed outright, leaning forward and slapping George on a buttock playfully. "Jesus, George, you're too much." She chided.</p>
		<p>George laughed. "But it's true," She said emphatically. She wagged a finger at Cassidy. "Andrea is coming today, you know. She comes here every day for you, and she loves you, you imp." She poked Cassidy's straight nose softly, and met her eyes. "You better not fuck it up this time. Understood? Because I'll put you in the hospital again, Cassidy."</p>
		<p>Cassidy blinked a yes. She felt so happy to have her friends there with her, and she couldn't wait to lay eyes on Andrea. She felt like a real idiot, having pushed everyone whom loved her away. She promised herself she wouldn't do it again, it took her brush with death to realize what was more important. Fear or love were her choices. Of course, love won out.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh came in a few minutes, rolling a tall table like thing in with her. On top of it was a cylinder like tube that measured breath for patients who had been in need of respiratory aid, or that had been laying down for a long period of time. There were also surgical scissors, and other assorted items. There was also a bowl shaped plate, and a cup of water.</p>
		<p>She found Robie and George laughing. "Now what is so funny, if I may ask?" She demanded good-naturedly, smiling softly. She sent a special smile at Robie, full of promises and desire, and George didn't miss it. Ashleigh looked at Cassidy, and walked towards her with a smile, trailing the little table with her.</p>
		<p>George moved to stand beside Robie.</p>
		<p>"I'm going to take this thing off, babe." Ashleigh said gently, tapping the long tube. Cassidy blinked her understanding. Ashleigh bent over her, eyeing and touching around the tape with intense concentration, getting an idea of how much the tape was stuck to Cassidy's skin. "Hopefully, there won't be any rashes. I'll give you a lotion to apply to your skin, it should definitely be dry." She said thoughtfully, and then proceeded to pull the tape off slowly. After all the tape was painfully removed, Ashleigh forced Cassidy's mouth open wider with a gloved finger over each lip, peering into her mouth around the tube.</p>
		<p>She pressed the bell above the bed, and a minute later a dark haired, slim young nurse came into the room. "Yes, doctor?" She said pleasantly.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh gestured her closer. "Put some gloves on, Ms. DeFranc, you're going to help me remove this tube." She said. "Come here." The nurse obeyed, moving closer to the bed as she donned the gloves. "Okay," Ashleigh said, and smiled down at Cassidy. "You're going to grab her jaw like this, and keep her mouth open. I'll pull the tube out and the rest is history. Okay?" The nurse nodded. "Cassidy, do what I tell you. Take a deep breath and hold it. Good, and now exhale." As Cassidy did so, Ashleigh pulled the tube out.</p>
		<p>Seconds later, Cassidy was sitting up in bed and coughing up thick phlegm into the bowl, going back and forth between spitting and sucking air in from the cylinder tube. She inhaled as deep as she could go, and gagged, more phlegm coming up from her lungs. "Oh, God!" She gasped groggily; she was already feeling tired. She spit more and then could not any more. "I can't any more, Ash." She groaned, feeling an uncomfortable pain in her stomach.</p>
		<p>"Just a little more, Cas." George said soothingly, sitting at the foot of the bed, rubbing her leg softly.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled at her friends and completed the task of getting her lungs to work again, no unwanted fluids inside them.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Carey stood leaning against her red Ford Mustang, twirling her keys with a finger, waiting for her daughter outside the high school. The youth hadn't come out yet, but Carey knew that in about five minutes they would be tearing out through the exit. She stood thinking of the Cassidy and Andrea problem, musing about what a fool Cassidy Monsignor had been. Andrea was the woman of anyone's dreams, and more, and Carey would give an arm and a leg to be given the opportunity to be Andrea's lover.</p>
		<p>Roseanne came out accompanied by two pretty girls flanking her, she looked a little stressed as they each tried to get her attention. Carey frowned, confused as to what was happening. Roseanne saw Carey, and fastened her pace towards her mother, grinning. "Hi, mom!" She said with her rambunctious voice, her blue eyes twinkled. Both girls stood silently by her side, and smiled at Carey shyly. "Mum, this is Jenya Field," She pointed at the black haired, nicely bodied young woman. "And this is Manuela Montero." She pointed to the pretty auburn haired young woman at her other side.</p>
		<p>Carey nodded slowly, her eyes widening knowingly. Andrea had told her a little about both girls and their situations with Roseanne. "Hello, girls." She said softly. She caught the pleading look in Roseanne's blue eyes, and grinned mischievously. "Care for some ice cream, girls?" She offered.</p>
		<p>Manuela seemed sad, she bit her lower lip and said: "I have to go home, Mrs. Mitchell, my mom keeps a tab on me." She smiled softly at Roseanne, touching her shoulder softly. "I'll see you tomorrow?"</p>
		<p>Roseanne smiled shyly at her. "Yeah." She said, and waved to her as Manuela walked away, looking back. She turned to look at Jenya, who was fidgeting a little. "What about you?" Roseanne asked.</p>
		<p>"I have practice, you know that." Jenya said, looking very sorry. Then she seemed to make up her mind. "I won't go."</p>
		<p>Carey lifted her hand. She said: "Now, now, young lady. You can't miss practice. If I'm correct, this affects your grade, no?" Jenya nodded. "In any case, I need to speak with my daughter. I'm sure you always find time to be with her in school." She extended her hand and Jenya took it. "It was great meeting you, we'll definitely see each other again, if you visit our home. Now have a good day, and off with you to practice."</p>
		<p>After Jenya left, Roseanne laughed softly as she got into the car. "So what are we gonna do, Mum?" She asked, pulling the seatbelt over her chest and lap, clicking it in place.</p>
		<p>Carey climbed into the driver's side and pulled her seatbelt on too. She slipped the car key into the ignition. She ran her hand through her short curly hair, leaning an elbow against the steering wheel and smiling at her daughter. "We're going to talk, that's what we're doing." She said, turning the ignition. The mustang rumbled to life, and she pulled off.</p>
		<p>Roseanne smiled at her mother, asking: "What about?" She liked talking to her mother; her mother could be so cool sometimes.</p>
		<p>Carey grinned, and glanced at her daughter with a tender expression. "About those two girls, and what you're doing to solve the situation among you girls." She said, turning at the corner.</p>
		<p>"Aww, Mum, let me deal with that please." She said whiningly. "I like both of them, and they are kind of willing to bear with me for a while."</p>
		<p>Carey laughed softly. "But for how long, Rose?" She asked, pulling into a parking spot. She turned towards her daughter and leaned an elbow against the steering wheel. "Their feelings will be hurt, or maybe yours. Do you understand, Roseanne? Maybe they won't want to wait for you for such and such time, maybe they'll grow tired. I think you have to make your decision soon."</p>
		<p>Roseanne's eyes widened, and she bit the inside of her cheek softly. "Thanks, mum." She said after a few moments of silence. "I have to think about it, really. I want to make the right decision. I like them both a lot and I'm very confused." She bit her lower lip softly, and golden eyebrows crunching together. "I really don't need pressure." She looked frustrated, her eyes filling with tears.</p>
		<p>Carey caught her tears and nodded, then she stared straight ahead. "I understand." She said in a low voice. "But I'm trying to help you, baby girl," She continued sweetly, reaching over with one hand and squeezing Roseanne's. "I don't want my baby to be hurt, is that understandable?"</p>
		<p>Roseanne nodded. "Yeah," She said softly, and wiped her teary eyes with her sleeve.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, Carey laughed. "I don't know how you do it, honey," She teased, and Roseanne smiled. "But you need to teach me the art of juggling two women. I mean," She said with a chuckle. "To be able to be honest with them, and get away with it." She laughed outright. "You're too much, I thought your father and I taught you better."</p>
		<p>"You did, mum. That's why I was honest with both of them, but I'll make a decision soon, I promise." Roseanne replied.</p>
		<p>"I believe in you." Carey said squeezing her hand again, and then she slapped the steering wheel softly. "Now, let's go eat a little something before we go back and pick Andrea up. We are going with her to visit her friend Cassidy. I don't know if you know that she's very ill."</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Andrea walked into Cassidy's empty hospital room, and was momentarily confused when she saw that the bed was empty. And then realization slammed through her violently. A shot of fear sliced through her whole body; her heart skipped a beat. Where was Cassidy? Could she have&#133;? <i>No!</i> Her mind screamed. Just the thought of Cassidy dying sent a stab through her heart. Her eyes filled up with tears and her legs weakened as she let forth a ragged sob, dropping her purse heavily on the floor. Her body shut down, and she was on the verge of loosing her mind.</p>
		<p>Carey, who was right behind her, grabbed her arms and held her up. "Andrea," She said. "What is wrong with you, woman?"</p>
		<p>Andrea pointed with a shaky hand towards the empty bed, and Carey blinked in confusion. "Cassidy!" Andrea sobbed, and she fell to her knees heavily. The tears trickled thickly down her cheeks, and she couldn't control the sobs that tore from her body. Carey tried to soothe her by saying that there must be some mistake, and that she shouldn't jump to conclusions. But Andrea was beyond understanding her words. "Oh, God, Carey, what will I do without her?" She moaned in despair, not accepting the thought that Cassidy could be dead. "No!" She screamed, wrenching herself free of Carey's arms.</p>
		<p>A startled Cassidy emerged unsteadily from the bathroom upon hearing the scream, her eyes circling the room and ending up on Andrea. They filled with tears, and her body shook. Andrea gasped at the sight of her and cried even harder. "Cassidy!" She sobbed, opening her arms to her. She was so weak, she couldn't get up to her feet.</p>
		<p>Carey gasped behind Andrea, and she smiled at Cassidy. "See? I knew there had to be some mistake." She said softly, grinning now.</p>
		<p>"Andy." Cassidy said hoarsely, moving towards her slowly, her arms outstretched. She looked roughed, with her hair in a long braid, her body noticeably thinner beneath the hospital gown, and her cheeks slightly hollowed out. Still, she looked beautiful and strong, despite her weakness and thinness. "Andy, oh God!" She whispered hoarsely, the tears leaving her eyes in hot trails down her cheeks.</p>
		<p>Andrea gasped tearfully, struggling to her feet with the help of Carey. "Cassidy." She whispered as Cassidy walked into her arms, wrapping her own tightly around her. "Oh my God, Cassidy! I thought you were gone, I thought you'd left me!" She sobbed against her ear, holding her tightly to herself. "I love you, Cassidy, I'm so in love with you! Oh God!"</p>
		<p>Carey smiled softly, and left the room, pulling and locking the door after herself.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's arms tightened as hard as they could, and she sobbed hoarsely, her voice raspy from going on unused. Andrea pulled back, cupping Cassidy's head with her hands and looking up into her eyes. The sweetness in Cassidy's golden brown eyes intoxicated her, possessed her and she was surrendering to their golden hue. She pulled Cassidy's head lower, and pressed her lips softly against hers. She trembled when Cassidy's smooth lips responded to hers, when they opened to allow her silky tongue passage.</p>
		<p>Andrea could taste the salt of their tears mingled with the taste of the toothpaste Cassidy had just used. Their lips pressed together hard and passionately, their breathing grew fast and raspy. Their kiss was erotically wild, wet, and full of love and wanting. Hungrily, Cassidy claimed Andrea's lips, and it was as if no time had passed since they'd last been together. It was as if there had been no separation. She knew she'd been stupid, and she had hardly been able to wait until Andrea would arrive to see her.</p>
		<p>They pulled their lips apart, and Cassidy rested her cheek against Andrea's softly, breathing hard and fast. "Oh, Andy." She whispered softly, feeling her body ignite with sexual energy and love. "We," She continued, tightening her arms around her. "We need to talk, I have a lot to tell you. I have been an idiot, baby, I have. I love you more than anything in this world, more than my own life."</p>
		<p>Andrea pulled back and met her eyes. "You have to love yourself, baby. Because I can't take another scare like this one, when you collapsed in front of me like that-" She burst into tears again.</p>
		<p>Cassidy pulled her into her arms again and cradled her face against her chest. Andrea grasped her, her hands on her back grasping the hospital robe frantically as she tried to pull her impossibly closer. She wanted Cassidy closer, wanted her inside. She needed her badly, and she resolved herself to never let her go. She complied as Cassidy pulled her towards the hospital bed, a sudden need consuming them.</p>
		<p>Cassidy didn't care where they were. She wanted Andrea now. Her hands were already touching, caressing the silky smooth skin of Andrea's neck, her face. She became hypnotized with the feel of the smooth flawless skin that was breaking out in sweat beneath her fingers.</p>
		<p>Andrea gasped, reaching frantically beneath Cassidy's hospital robe and touching the nude smooth skin. Cassidy gasped, trembling, running her fingers to the back of Andrea's neck and grasping the soft hair as she pulled her for a deep kiss. Her tongue was exploring, commanding, and she was taking full charge of their passion. Pushing her to lay across the bed, she positioned herself on top of her, feeling Andrea's soft fingers glide across the defined muscles of her bare back. She kissed her neck and whispered against her ear: "I am so in love with you, Andy, you don't know how much I have tried not to be." She kissed her graceful neck again softly, licking the sensitive skin below her ear.</p>
		<p>She began to open her shirt very slowly, looking deeply into her eyes as she allowed her fingers to touch her skin as she unbuttoned. Andrea's eyes were half closed, her breathing was erratic, and she was feverishly helping Cassidy open her shirt. Their fingers rubbed together as they strained against the seemingly infinite buttons and Andrea groaned passionately, pulling Cassidy down and kissing her lips hard.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's trembling fingers finished the task of opening her shirt and were teasing over the bra-covered nipples. Andrea gasped loudly, her tongue licking Cassidy's lips softly. Her body was moving against Cassidy's, her back arched and she offered her breasts to Cassidy's hands. Cassidy sucked Andrea's tongue into her mouth as her hand cupped a full aching breast. Desire was burning through their bodies; passion was fire in their blood. Cassidy's trembling hand was moving lower, palm pressing against Andrea's quivering stomach and fingers going beneath the waistband of her slacks.</p>
		<p>Andrea's stomach quivered harder, her legs spread and hung off the bed, and she unbuttoned her pants to allow Cassidy's hand more room to move in. Cassidy's fingers stroked the immense wetness between Andrea's legs, and her other arm moved beneath Andrea's neck to cradle her head as she kissed her. Andrea groaned as Cassidy's fingers moved against her clitoris, she threw her head back and cried out throatily as Cassidy entered her. She threw an arm around Cassidy's neck, and pressed her lips tighter against hers. "Oh, yes!" She gasped against her hot mouth, moving her hips fast and hard to meet Cassidy's fingers inside her.</p>
		<p>She was trembling, her whole body quivering out of control, her passion unleashed. She was crying out throatily, grasping Cassidy's shoulder with her free hand and concentrating only on Cassidy's hand between her legs. She lost herself in Cassidy's touch, and was incandescent in her arms. She was helpless to the orgasms running through her body, oblivious to anything but Cassidy's fingers in her.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>Carey leaned casually against the wall outside of Cassidy's room despite the fact that she could hear Andrea's throaty cries. She stood with a leg crossed over the other, and her eyes concentrating on her perfectly manicured fingernails. George, Gretchen and Robie were coming down the hall slowly, walking close together, smiling happily at each other as they chatted. Carey eyed them curiously, her eyebrows arching softly, her blue eyes amused. George noticed her standing next to the door as they stopped in front of it, and frowned slightly. She reached out a hand to take the doorknob to Cassidy's room and twist it. Carey advised in her distinctive Irish brogue, with an amused expression on her face: "I wouldn't go in there, if I were you." She smiled at all of them.</p>
		<p>George, being much taller, looked down at her suspiciously, frowning as she moved again to the door. Gretchen studied Carey guardedly, wondering who she was. And Robie stood with her arms crossed over her chest, eyeing her seriously. "Who are <i>you</i>?" Gretchen asked, a hand on her hip, her voice demanding.</p>
		<p>Carey smiled at them, a charming smile that said, I<i> come in peace, women</i>. "I'm a friend of Andrea's," She said with a knowing arch to her eyebrows. "And she's in there." She jerked a thumb in the direction of the door. "When I left them, they were in no condition to be bothered, <i>trust</i> me." She laughed, and then grinned openly at all of them.</p>
		<p>George smiled knowingly, hearing noise from within since she was close to the door. Also, upon recognizing Carey as a lesbian, she offered her hand as she apologized and introduced herself. Carey accepted it with her considerably smaller hand and shook it firmly, introducing herself to all of them also. "So why don't we all go and have some coffee." She suggested, slipping her hands into her pockets and rocking slightly on her feet.</p>
		<p>George agreed, and Gretchen eyed her curiously as George guided her down the hall with a hand on her back. Robie seemed curious also, but still followed them too. Neither one of them had gotten the point. "Maybe we can find Ashleigh, see if she's not busy&#133;" Robie was saying as they walked away.</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-Two">
		<p>Cassidy lay in the circle of Andrea's arms, her arms wrapped around her waist, so spent and so sleepy. She was awake though, breathing hard and feeling the remnants of her orgasm still running through her body. They shifted and lay with the length of their bodies matching that of the bed, legs entwined, bodies pressed together tightly. Cassidy's head rested comfortably against Andrea's full chest, her lips caressing the wet skin softly. She had discarded her hospital gown and lay nude against Andrea's half-clad body. Andrea's shirt and bra had both been carelessly discarded along with Cassidy's hospital gown, but her pants remained, now wrinkled and open at the waist.</p>
		<p>"Cassidy," Andy whispered softly against her forehead, and Cassidy looked up to meet her eyes. "Are you willing to talk to me now?" She stroked Cassidy's sculpted cheek softly; each finger separated a few centimeters feeling the smooth skin tenderly. Cassidy nodded slowly, and kissed her fingers softly. "Good." Andrea said. "Why were you avoiding <i>us</i> so much?" She asked her softly, kissing her forehead tenderly.</p>
		<p>"I was afraid." Cassidy whispered, lifting her head up to look into her eyes. "You thought I was your best friend, but all the while I was head over heels in love with you." She took a deep breath, and continued: "<i>Plus</i> I wanted you with a passion that was killing me." She stopped suddenly, and broke their eye contact.</p>
		<p>"<i>Wanted</i> me?" Andrea said, trying to make a little light of the confession she'd just heard. The truth was that she wanted to jump all over the room and make a party. She was so happy. But she knew that Cassidy confessing such a deep feeling to her was something Cassidy never thought she'd be doing. "What, you don't want me any more? Got it all out of your system or something?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy laughed softly, and lifted her head to kiss Andrea's lips softly, slipping her tongue softly between the responding lips. "I still want you," She whispered sensuously. "More than ever, Andy." She kissed her again, passionately this time. Andrea wrapped her arms around her neck, her hands caressing her back softly, and fingernails raking her skin tenderly. Cassidy shivered, and whispered against her lips: "I want you more than ever, Andy. More than ever!" She groaned and lay on top of her again, pushing her breasts against Andrea's.</p>
		<p>Andrea moaned, and kissed her back, arching to the passion heating Cassidy's body. "Cassidy," She whispered softly against Cassidy's lips, groaning softly. "We're in the middle of a hospital, baby. We can't do this! You've just woken up, you're still weak&#133;" Her voice trailed into a soft moan off as Cassidy's mouth moved down to her breasts, her teeth sinking into the flushed flesh tenderly.</p>
		<p>"I'm not too weak to do this&#133;" She whispered against her flesh, groaning softly as Andrea's nipple blossomed against her tongue. "Am I?"</p>
		<p>"No." Andrea gasped and trembled. "Oh, God, no&#133;" She groaned, forgetting where they were as Cassidy's mouth moved lower to her stomach and lower still.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>That evening, Ashleigh and Robie sat in a very quiet well renowned lesbian owned restaurant, sitting huddling close together talking in hushed tones. "So," Robie said, leaning towards Ashleigh with a smile. "When are you sending Cassidy home?" She closely examined the woman twelve years her senior sitting beside her. <i>Ashleigh could pass for thirty-five, my age</i>, Robie thought fleetingly. <i>Hmmm, but I like the fact that she's older. Turns me on so much.</i> She felt a shiver run up and down her spinal cord in accordance with her thoughts, and her body was warm and getting warmer.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh smiled, and touched her cheek softly, seeing the flush in Robie's cheeks. "Well, not tomorrow, or the day after." She said quietly, leaning closer and kissing her lips softly. When she pulled back, she sighed audibly, a dreamy look in her eyes. "I have to have some tests done on her. Blood work, urine, you know, the usual." She continued. "And I want to make sure the kid is mentally stable and won't try some bullshit like that again. I'm going to recommend a psychiatrist to her, and it will be up to her to go, and to Andrea to convince her. I don't want to declare her dead next time." Tears came to her eyes unexpectedly.</p>
		<p>Robie felt tears come to her own eyes, but she held them back. "We all love her so much, don't we?" She said, smiling shakily and covering Ashleigh's hand with hers. "She has one big family of lesbians, right?" She laughed softly.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh chuckled, and leaned over to kiss her again. They kissed softly for a few minutes; Robie's fingers touched Ashleigh's strong neck softly. The tender lips pressed against hers became demanding, possessive. Ashleigh pulled away slowly, and looked into her eyes meaningfully. "Robie," She whispered, and kissed her again before asking hoarsely, pressing her lips against that sensitive area right below her ear: "Would you like to come home with me?"</p>
		<p>Robie trembled all over as Ashleigh's warm breath brushed her neck and ignited her passion. She closed her eyes tightly, and whispered raggedly: "Yes&#133;"</p>
		<p>Ashleigh didn't waste any time. She called the waitress over and asked for their check, throwing a large bill on the table and hurriedly pulling Robie out of the restaurant, not even bothering to wait for her change. The waitress was very happy to have such a big tip.</p>
		<pspace/>
		<p>They lay nude, holding each other under the covers of Ashleigh's bed. Robie was deeply asleep, her face pressed against the arch of Ashleigh's neck, resting on her muscled arm. Ashleigh slept lightly; she was aware of the sensuously smooth body pressed against hers. The long soft leg pressed between her legs and the arm thrown carelessly over her waist aroused her anew. Ashleigh's eyes opened, the light from the lamp bothering her eyes a little, and she lifted the covers protecting them from the breeze coming through Ashleigh's forgotten open window. She couldn't take her eyes away from the smooth skin of the woman that lay in her arms, and she replayed in her mind the last few hours they'd spent frantically making love.</p>
		<p>Cassidy had never surrendered to Ashleigh in the helpless way Robie had just surrendered to her when they made love. She was more the aggressor, much to Ashleigh's pleasure, but also to her frustration. Robie was perfect, she liked being loved, and loving. It was a combination that drove Ashleigh wild; especially when Robie had lain on her back, staring at Ashleigh as she undressed with clouded passionate eyes. She had been waiting for Ashleigh to take her, sensing the need in Ashleigh to love with her body. It was not long before Ashleigh was naked, and lying on top of her, kissing her and possessing her with her hands and tongue. Their bodies had molded and moved together as if they had been made for one another.</p>
		<p>The memory of the way Robie tasted remained on Ashleigh's lips, and she licked them slowly. Pushing Robie gently onto her back slowly, not waking her just yet, she moved down slowly between her legs, wanting to imprint the taste of Robie's passion on her lips once again. Robie woke slowly to the tender teasing of her tongue, parting her legs more, and then immediately responding to the pleasure that almost immediately turned into an ecstatic orgasm.</p>

	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-Three">
		<p>Jeffrey walked cautiously down the silent hallway in the middle of the morning, looking up and down the hall for any nurses, when he knew that no visitors would be in. He also didn't want to run into Ashleigh Simmons, that "dyke doctor," as he referred to her. He knew she hated him with a passion, and knew that at any opportunity, she'd destroy him with her Amazon strength. He found out Cassidy's room number by calling in and asking to be transferred to her room telephone. "Okay," The operator had said with an annoying nasal twang. "Room Three Forty."</p>
		<p>She'd picked up almost right away, and he recognized her voice, hanging up and deciding what he'd do with the information. He knocked, and her voice rang out from inside. "Come in."</p>
		<p>Opening the door slowly, he saw that she was sitting languidly on her bed, an open notepad on her lap, a poised ballpoint pen in her hand. Obviously, she'd been expecting Ashleigh or one of the nurses, because as soon as she laid eyes on him her smile faded and was replaced by a scowl. "What do you want?" She demanded coldly, putting the notepad and pen on the bed and standing up slowly.</p>
		<p>Jeffrey smirked and stood with his hands in his pockets. "So you're okay now." He stated the obvious with obvious wishes for it to be the opposite. "Weren't you dying? Or was that another ploy to take Andrea away from me?"</p>
		<p>The words stung. Cassidy narrowed her eyes angrily; a deep red flush covered her dark skin. "You are a bastard." She said in a low voice, trying to remain calm, knowing that if she was to get even better, she needed to relax. "I do not need any <i>ploy</i> to have Andrea. She loves me."</p>
		<p>"You know she's pregnant?" He asked, a triumphant smile covering his face. "Did she tell you she's pregnant with my child?"</p>
		<p>The disbelief showed on Cassidy's face before she could cover it up, regain her composure. "What are you talking about?" She said, holding her emotions under control. Inside, she was in turmoil, she didn't know what to think.</p>
		<p>Jeffrey rocked calmly in his feet. The truth was that he wanted to wrap his hands around her neck and break it. But he knew he'd be pointed as an instant suspect by her friends and would be found out. He did his best to control his urge, and said instead, seeking to hurt her in deeper ways: "Andrea and I have been planning to have a baby for months, didn't she tell you that? Why do you think she hasn't broken up with me? Had you thought that maybe she's just experimenting?" He walked towards the window and gazed out, poisoning Cassidy with his words. He turned to look at her, seemingly calm, though inside, he wanted to choke the life out of her. "I personally think every woman has to experiment at one time or another, and that's what Andrea's doing. </p>
		<p>"You see, I'm not jealous, because I know what she wants is this." He placed a hand over his endowment, grinning nastily as he massaged it slightly. "She comes home to me every night and rides this, right after she leaves here from seeing you and trying to make you feel better about yourself." He smiled with sarcastic sympathy. "She just feels sorry for you, Cassidy. As soon as you leave here, we marry."</p>
		<p>Cassidy gazed unemotionally at him, not wanting to give him the satisfaction of seeing that he'd hurt her. "Get out." She said in a calm monotone. "Go!" She was beginning to loose it, her brown eyes narrowing, her jaw clenching. She clenched her fists hard and tight, taking a step towards him, ready to break his face if he didn't leave.</p>
		<p>Jeffrey smiled at her, eyebrows arched and with his hands still in his pockets. Then he walked towards the door, and opened it slowly, glancing back at her one last time. "I'd appreciate it if you stay away from my <i>fianc</i>." He pulled out a small box and opened it, reaching out with his hand and putting it to eye's view for Cassidy. Two diamond-encrusted rings, one slightly larger than the other, shone out from the small box. Cassidy's eyes remained emotionless, but Jeffrey could tell by the edge in her voice, the clenching of her jaw, that he had affected her. "You see, I already bought the rings. We're basically ready to tie the knot." He said pleasantly, and walked out.</p>
		<p>Cassidy closed her eyes tightly, struggling not to believe the information she'd just been given. She turned and clenched her fists, feeling tense and hot. She was trying to control her breathing, which was hard with the stress. She strode over to one of the vases of flowers and swept if off the table with one violent thrust. It shattered against the wall, water and flowers flying everywhere. A sob tore from her throat, and she swayed towards the bed.</p>
		<p>The violent sound had attracted the attention of the floor nurse, and she'd called Ashleigh over the line just before she'd left the desk to run to Cassidy's room. She eyed Jeffrey curiously as she passed by him; she'd seen him come out of Cassidy's room and had heard the sound a few seconds later. She found Cassidy lying on the bed, crying as she was straining to breathe. She touched her forehead, whispering soothing words and found that Cassidy's forehead was hot. Worriedly, she checked her temperature and found that it was high, at one hundred and two. She was baffled at the speed with which it rose. Just twenty minutes before, she'd checked and it had been normal.</p>
		<p>She applied the ever-ready oxygen mask that hung from the bed rail, ready for use in any emergency. At first, Cassidy fought against her, hands pushing away, but she gave in when Ashleigh walked in and ordered in that no-nonsense voice of hers to her to stay put. "What happened?" Ashleigh asked of the nurse when they'd put the extremely nervous Cassidy to bed. She had fallen into an exhausted sleep and Ashleigh had written into her clipboard, telling the nurse to retrieve a Tylenol anti-fever for Cassidy's fever.</p>
		<p>Upon making the half-unconscious Cassidy drink the tablets of Tylenol, the nurse explained. "She received a visit a few minutes ago," She said, she covered Cassidy gently and smoothed her hair. "And after he left, she got like this."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh's eyes snapped from Cassidy to the nurse. "He?" She demanded in a strained voice, her body and voice rigid. "What did he look like?" She was thinking that maybe it was Josua, or, she didn't know which was worst, Jeffrey.</p>
		<p>"Tall, handsome." The nurse said thoughtfully. "Nicely dressed, as if he were from GQ or something. Blue eyes, blonde. That's about all."</p>
		<p>But Ashleigh already knew who'd been there, and she was going to talk with Andrea about that as soon as she would get there.</p>
	</chapter>
	<chapter title="Chapter Twenty-Four">
		<p>As Andrea passed by the floor nurse's desk to get to Cassidy's room, the nurse stopped her. "Is something the matter?" She asked, feeling instantly anxious and thinking that maybe Cassidy was ill again. "Is Cassidy okay?" She demanded, gripping the edge of the desk.</p>
		<p>The nurse smiled reassuringly. "No, no." She said, shaking her head and dismissing Andrea's fears with a wave of her hand.</p>
		<p>"Then?" Andrea said, visibly relaxed.</p>
		<p>"Doctor Simmons wants to see you before you go in to see Ms. Monsignor." The nurse informed her, directing her down the hall towards the chief doctor's office, where the head doctor for the tour would lounge until their shift was over.</p>
		<p>Andrea found Ashleigh leaning back comfortably on her chair, her feet propped on the table and her hands clasped behind her head. Ashleigh straightened as Andrea walked in without knocking. She seemed worried, but she still smiled, standing up and giving Andrea a kiss on the cheek. Andrea kissed her back, and sat down on the chair Ashleigh indicated. "What's going on, Ashleigh?" Andrea asked right away.</p>
		<p>Andrea saw her anger, her upset. She was clenching the fist on her lap, and her jaw clenched. Ashleigh bit her lower lip, and seemed thoughtful, but then she said: "I have found out that Jeffrey was here."</p>
		<p>Andrea frowned, shaking her head. "But why would he come here?" She asked no one in particular.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh lifted her eyes from the desk to meet Andrea's. "Come on, Andrea," She chided. "To torture Cassidy, that's why he came here. He knows she's ill at this moment, and vulnerable. And he knows she loves you, he's always known and he's done his best to make her feel very uncomfortable about what's happening between you two." She paused, meeting Andrea's increasingly angry eyes, and then continued: "Jeffrey hates Cassidy, Andrea, and that's because he loves you.</p>
		<p>"He came here today and told her that you were pregnant, that you'd been planning this 'baby' for months, that you never broke up with him, and that you were waiting for her to come out of the hospital to go ahead and marry him. Cassidy believed him, and nothing I could say made her doubt his words. I mean, he went as far as to show her pair of wedding rings, for God's sake!" She shook her head slowly, sucking her teeth softly. "She can be a child when she's like this, sick and all. You know that, she'd believe anything anyone would tell her." She'd found out what had happened that morning from Cassidy herself, who had tearfully let it all out after Ashleigh questioned and pressured her into telling her what had happened.</p>
		<p>"That's absurd!" Andrea snapped. Her usually warm blue eyes were cold in her anger, and her usually sweet face was hard and flushed. "What a bastard." She muttered, staring at the floor. Suddenly, she stood up. "I have to go speak with Cassidy."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh stood up and followed her down the hall towards Cassidy's room. They stood outside the door and looked at each other. Ashleigh said with her controlled voice: "If I see him here again, I'll break his face."</p>
		<p>Andrea nodded. "That's if I don't kill him first." She said. "How <i>could</i> he?" She shook her head, thinking that perhaps Cassidy would not even want to see her. She hesitated, her hand on the doorknob. "Damn." She muttered, and opened the door slowly, walking in and pushing the door closed. Cassidy was lying on her side, her knees drawn up to her chest, her arms wrapped around her legs, eyes closed. Andrea approached the bed slowly, and then stood there, reaching out a tentative hand and touching her shoulder. "Cassidy."</p>
		<p>Cassidy jerked her shoulder away, tightening her arms around her legs. Andrea touched her shoulder again, and grabbed it, so that Cassidy could not pull away. Cassidy tried to pull away, but her position made it hard. She stopped trying to pull away, and simply allowed Andrea's hand to rest there, not acknowledging it any more. Andrea pulled at her shoulder, and forced her to lie on her back. Cassidy's eyes were closed; she wouldn't look at Andrea, her sensuous lips were set in a straight line. Unable to help herself, Andrea leaned down and kissed them softly, Cassidy turned her face away.</p>
		<p>"Cassidy," Andrea said softly. "I hope you don't believe what Jeffrey told you. <i>You</i> of all people must know that I wouldn't lie to you. I never have." She waited, waiting to see if Cassidy would respond.</p>
		<p>Cassidy couldn't stop the tears that slid out of her eyes, nor could she stop her lower lip from trembling. She sat up, and covered her face with her hands. "I don't know what to believe." She whispered hoarsely. "He showed me that ring&#133;"</p>
		<p>Andrea laughed softly, and Cassidy thought she was being ridiculed. "You can't possibly believe that!" She exclaimed, touching Cassidy's shoulder and kneading the tense muscles there. She could feel Cassidy begin to relax and lean more against her. "I think he had purchased them with the wish that I would eventually marry him." She whispered huskily, - becoming aroused and feeling need- close to her ear, feeling her shiver against her. "I don't think he was counting on my falling in love with you, baby. I <i>am</i> in love with you, Cassidy. I love you more than anything in this universe." She kissed below her ear softly, trailing along her fine strong jaw, and ended up pressing against her lips. "Do you believe me?" She asked softly against her lips, sitting down beside Cassidy slowly.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's arms wrapped around her waist slowly, and they kissed fully on the lips; she slid her velvety tongue between her teeth. A sudden flash of heat began between Andrea's legs, becoming an aching throb and pumping hot flashes through her body. Andrea's arms wrapped around Cassidy's shoulders and they held their bodies frantically tight to one another. "Hmmm," Cassidy moaned softly, pulling her lips back slightly, though not breaking contact. She couldn't help herself; arousal was pumping through her body like blood. "So you're not pregnant?" She asked huskily, beyond the point of caring.</p>
		<p>Andrea pulled back and looked into her eyes. "No." She whispered. "He lied, Cassidy, when will you understand that?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy didn't respond; she just pushed Andrea onto her back, her head at the foot of the bed. Lying heavily on top of her, she kissed her fully on the lips, her tongue working its way into the responding hot mouth once again. She pressed her body against her frantically, hips between her legs, and feverishly began kissing her. Both women moaned softly, hands frantically searching as they lost control of any inhibitions that had invaded their thoughts.</p>
		<p>Afterwards, lying in a deep lassitude of afterglow after their brief lovemaking session, they talked in quiet tones. Andrea's lips were pressed against Cassidy's forehead, her arms around her shoulders and her fingers sifting through the thick dark hair. Cassidy's head rested on Andrea's half-clothed chest, her fingers playing at the band of Andrea's opened pants. "So you're not pregnant?" Cassidy asked again, her lips nibbling on the fleshy skin of Andrea's chest.</p>
		<p>Andrea pulled her head back, and looked into Cassidy's eyes, feeling a tad bit annoyed. She knew that Cassidy would be insecure about them, and she understood too how she felt. If she'd been in Cassidy's shoes, she would be feeling the same way. "I don't want to have to tell you again that Jeffrey lied, Cassidy. <i>You</i>, of all people, should know that I don't lie." She said sternly and Cassidy looked suitably embarrassed.</p>
		<p>Cassidy nodded, and kissed her softly. "I do not like Jeffrey." She whispered, looking once again into Andrea's eyes. "I never have, and he's never liked me."</p>
		<p>"I just realized that myself." Andrea answered, and a sheepish smile took over her face. "I guess I wasn't paying that much attention." She shook herself. "But enough about that. Why don't we talk <i>us</i>?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy sat up, and Andrea did too. "What is there to talk about? We are together, are we not?" Cassidy said shortly, she was never good at talking about relationships. She'd been so used to getting her way with women, meaning just sexually. And now that the woman that she loved with all her heart was opening a talk about their future, she didn't know how to deal with it.</p>
		<p>Andrea, who knew all about Cassidy, smiled, stroking Cassidy's back with her opened palm. "You are something else, Cassidy." She whispered softly close to her ear, and she felt Cassidy shiver. "I want to spend the rest of my life with you, honey, that's what there is to say."</p>
		<p>Cassidy closed her eyes, she couldn't believe she'd just heard those words. "But what if this is just a phase for you, Andy." She protested in a faltering voice. "What if what you feel for me is not real, but a passing passion?"</p>
		<p>Andrea sighed, flopping herself onto her back, throwing an arm over her eyes. "Do I have to make a point of proving myself to you, Cassidy?" She said with exasperation. "You are one incredibly stubborn woman, do you know that?" She demanded, lifting her arm and peering at Cassidy from underneath it.</p>
		<p>Cassidy bowed her head, and stared at her lap quietly. She just didn't want to get hurt. "I do not want to get hurt, Andrea." She said slowly, echoing her feelings.</p>
		<p>Andrea sat up quickly, and rested her head comfortingly on her shoulder, wrapping an arm around her neck. She took a deep breath, and smelled the ever-present sweet scent of Cassidy's skin. "I love you more than anything, Cassidy. I love you more than words can say." She whispered softly. "When I first realized that I was feeling something for you, I was so confused. I didn't know what to do, or how to tell you. I thought you'd want to end our friendship and never talk to me again. I didn't know you were feeling something for me too." She looked at Cassidy with thoughtful eyes.</p>
		<p>Cassidy was staring off somewhere, biting her lower lip as she thought. "I was already going crazy with love for you by the time we were in high school. I did not know I-" She broke off, her eyebrows crunching together as she recalled her torturous feelings so long ago. "I realized it when I, you know, cut myself," She seemed a little embarrassed, but Andrea didn't allow her to be, she kissed her tenderly on the cheek and waited silently for her to continue. Cassidy did. "When you were by my side," She whispered, tears coming to her eyes. "Day and night."</p>
		<p>Andrea pulled her close, turning her face and pressing it to her neck. She whispered sweet things in Cassidy's ear until she calmed.</p>
		<p>"I have put you through a lot, haven't I?" Cassidy whispered against her skin, kissing softly, wanting more of Andrea, not caring if someone walked in. She wrapped her strong arms around Andrea and pulled her closer, turning towards her and pushing them down.</p>
		<p>"Uh-huh, you've put me through a lot," Andrea whispered distractedly, her hands already touching the skin of Cassidy's bare firm back, arousing her anew. She paused, and met Cassidy's sexy eyes. "But you know what?" She said, moving her lips closer to her lover's.</p>
		<p>"What?" Cassidy whispered hoarsely, her eyes already closing as she turned towards her, her lips brushing against Andrea's. She was breathing hard, her hands already moving into Andrea's pants, pushing them down.</p>
		<p>Andrea moaned softly, her arms tightening around Cassidy's shoulders. "We can only count on Ashleigh to let us get away with this in a hospital room." She whispered, and her lips were Cassidy's for the taking, her body willingly becoming a temple to be admired and explored by Cassidy's expert, knowing hands. Openly giving her body in a sweet surrender.</p>
