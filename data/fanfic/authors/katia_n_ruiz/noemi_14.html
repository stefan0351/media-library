<!-- Noemí \ Chapter Fourteen -->

<p>Noemí stood by the window in her office, looking out at the street below and smiling to herself.</p>
		<p>She'd had a surprise meeting upon arrival to the office; her employees, when she was around, tended to hound her and tell her every single small detail of what happened in the company. She was an efficient leader, and her employees felt insecure when she wasn't around. The meeting lasted no more than ten minutes, with her carefully teasing solution and dismissal of their complaints.</p>
		<p>She didn't turn when someone knocked on her door, but she said over her shoulder: "Come in."</p>
		<p>Camilla Cortez, the director of finances, stepped shyly in. She carried an envelope in her perfectly manicured hands; her brown eyes looked cautiously at Noemí's back. For the first time in years, she could see that usually rigid back relaxed. She relaxed too. "Ms. Leone, I need you to sign these." She said in her pretty alto voice. Noemí turned to her and gestured to one of the chairs. "Thank you," Camilla said as she sat and handed over the folder. "Those are just some paperwork for the purchases of property in Queens for the new office." She explained as Noemí read the papers inside. "When would you like to go see it?"</p>
		<p>Noemí looked up at her as if it had never occurred to her to see the property, which pleased Camilla because that meant Noemí, trusted her decisions. Surprised by the look on Noemí's face, she smiled tentatively; it had been so long since she'd seen her smile. Her white-blue eyes had a new light inside them that looked pleasing and attractive. Noemí shrugged and looked back down at the papers, reading. "How about now?" She asked thoughtfully.</p>
		<p>"Now is perfectly fine." Camilla said softly. "And then maybe we can have lunch?" She suggested almost without realizing it.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled softly and nodded thoughtfully. She stood suddenly, and put the folder down. "This can wait," She said, tapping it with a slender finger, and came around the desk to the door. "Let's go see the office."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They decided to take Noemí's car, the more comfortable of the two. At the office space, Noemí nodded thoughtfully as she eyed everything about the space, taking her time with every detail. "I like it." She said, and turned around to smile at Camilla. "You have a good eye, Camilla."</p>
		<p>Camilla's cheeks flushed to a pink color. "Thank you, Ms. Leone." She said, self-conscious at the compliment.</p>
		<p>Noemí pushed her hands into her pockets and looked around one last time, and then she looked at Camilla and smiled again. "How about that lunch now?" She asked in her low voice.</p>
		<p>Camilla nodded, suddenly breathless. "Sure."</p>
		<p>They left the office space, talking as they walked to Pizzeria Uno's close by. Inside, they sat directly across from one another, smiling and talking. They ordered, and continued their conversation. Camilla, in awe of Noemí, realized that Noemí barely glanced at her before and said nothing more than a quick hello. Camilla knew of the death of her lover, and of how much Noemí had loved her. Noemí began to ask her about her family life, but stopped herself. "You don't mind me asking you all these questions, do you?" She asked in a low voice as they waited for their orders.</p>
		<p>Camilla laughed softly and relaxed against her seat. "No, no, I don't." She said, and in a moment of recklessness met Noemí's startling eyes. She felt breathless by their beauty. "I have always wondered what Noemí Leone was like outside the office."</p>
		<p>"You mean because I've been so rigid with everyone all this time?" Noemí asked with a smile, and Camilla flushed at being found out. She nodded, and Noemí looked down at the table. "Many things have happened to me that have caused me to be this way, but now I've decided to move along with my life, and do the best I can." She laughed softly. "I know it's sudden, it feels sudden to me, but I think my eyes have been opened." She paused, and met Camilla's eyes again. "Are you single, Camilla?" She asked suddenly.</p>
		<p>Camilla, caught unawares by the question, was speechless. The arrival of the waiter gave her time to recuperate. By the time he finished placing their meals on the table, she had gathered her wits. She shook her head. "Yes, Ms. Leone, I-"</p>
		<p>"Call me Noemí," Noemí said with a smile.</p>
		<p>"Noemí," Camilla said, and liked the taste of her name in her mouth. "A very beautiful name, how did your parents think of your name?" They were originally from Italy, that much Camilla knew, and she wondered at the Spanish sounding name.</p>
		<p>Noemí's smile grew. "They didn't." She said and laughed softly at the look Camilla gave her. "Actually, my nana René thought it up. She has been with my parents since before I was born. Her mother's name was Noemí, and she had taken care of my mom before René. My mother absolutely adored the woman, and she loves René too."</p>
		<p>Camilla smiled and they began to eat; she noticed how slowly Noemí ate. They chewed in comfortable silence; at times their eyes met, and Camilla couldn't stop attraction to Noemí from growing. She felt a response from Noemí also, and she grew bold. "I have something to say to you, Noemí." She said in a low voice.</p>
		<p>Noemí's eyebrow arched, and she looked at Camilla with question in her eyes.</p>
		<p>"I have had an attraction to you since I came into the company two years ago." She said softly, and looked down at her plate, expecting a rebuttal. She looked up at her when she didn't say anything.</p>
		<p>Noemí, sitting back on her chair, stared at her through unreadable eyes. Her smile teased Camilla, but then it was genuine. "Okay." She said with a nod.</p>
		<p>Afraid, Camilla asked softly: "Will this cause a problem?"</p>
		<p>Noemí seemed surprised by the question. "Why should it?" She said simply, and Camilla felt that everything was fine. Noemí reached over and stroked the back of her hand with slender fingers, then pulled back.</p>
		<p>Camilla felt a shiver run through her body from where Noemí's fingers touched her. She kept her eyes connected to Noemí's. "I- I don't know, because we work together?" She said in an uncertain voice.</p>
		<p>Noemí laughed softly, and pushed her plate away. "I don't think there would be any problem with that." She said in a low voice. "Occasional dinner and/or movie wouldn't hurt our working environment. I don't know about you, but I don't mix pleasure with business."</p>
		<p>Camilla shook her head and smiled. "Neither do I." She asserted.</p>
		<p>Noemí sat back on her chair, relaxed. She looked Camilla over slowly as she ate and smiled softly when she saw her flush red. Camilla, an attractive woman in her early thirties, had caught her attention. She was tall, though not as tall as Noemí, her body slender and attractive; she had sandy blonde hair picked up into a soft bun. She looked even better in dark blue slacks and a silk beige shirt that fell softly over her thin shoulders and full breasts. The muscles at her graceful throat were working as she chewed on her steak and Noemí wanted to kiss them. Camilla seemed to be in deep thought, and she looked up at Noemí. "Are <i>you</i> single?" She blushed.</p>
		<p>Noemí's smile turned sensuous. "I am single." She said huskily, her look heavy-lidded. She'd been horny before, but blush that spread across Camilla's cheeks reminded her of other kinds of blushes, and her body suddenly felt afire.</p>
		<p>Camilla's breath caught in her throat from the look in Noemí's eyes. She suddenly had nothing to say.</p>
		<p>Noemí realized that the ball was in her park. "Do you really want to return to the office?" She asked, and underlying beneath that question, lay an invitation. A dam was broken when she and Melanie had made love, and now it couldn't hold back the torrent of desire that now ran free.</p>
		<p>Camilla heard the underlying question, and breathless, she replied: "No, I really don't."</p>
		<p>Noemí's expression didn't change. "Do you live on your own, Camilla?" She asked, getting to the point.</p>
		<p>"Yes."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Oh, Camilla never expected this; this heat, this desire in this self-controlled woman.</p>
		<p>Noemí lay above her, strong and sweaty and her nude body moved along Camilla's nimbly, fast. Her kisses were hot fire on Camilla's lips, her soft tongue a kindling for the heat. Her hands were in Camilla's hair, loosening it, pulling it from the weak bun. Her moans were low, feral, her desire savage. Camilla's body couldn't help but respond to hers; her wetness came forth in great gushes. When Noemí touched between her legs, she was slick and ready for entrance. She spread her legs and cried out when Noemí entered her smoothly. Her perfectly manicured nails were scraping at Noemí's back; her teeth were sinking into her shoulder as her back arched. Her orgasms were quick, hard, stunning in their strength.</p>
		<p>Her back straightened as the tension of orgasm left her body; her impassioned cries seemed to echo off the walls in her bedroom. Noemí kissed her breasts, starting all over again, and she forgot once again about everything but Noemí's lovemaking.</p>
