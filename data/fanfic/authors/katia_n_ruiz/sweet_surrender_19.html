<!-- A Sweet Surrender \ Chapter Eighteen -->

<p>Josua was nodding off slouched on his couch, his chin pressed against his chest; a sliver of saliva slithered out of his parted mouth onto the front of his shirt, his feet rested on his coffee table. He was startled when a knock sounded at his door, jumping and blinking rapidly in his shock. He stood up unsteadily, and stumbled to the door. He yanked open the door, and barely saw who stood there before he felt the sharp painful blast of a fist in the middle of his face. He flew backwards, arms and limbs flailing, landing on his ass.</p>
		<p>Strong steps followed him, and he cried out, covering his bloody face. "No!"</p>
		<p>"You bastard!" A woman with a strong Australian accent sputtered, and he felt a sharp kick to his stomach.</p>
		<p>"Ugh!" He groaned, trying to protect himself with his arms. "What the fuck! You broke my <i>nose</i>!" He moaned, feeling the blood gush from his nose.</p>
		<p>"You fucking bastard! I'll kill you!" The same voice roared. A hand grasped his shirt and pulled him up with surprising strength. Through the haze of pain, he could see his attacker. She was staring down at him with angry blue eyes.</p>
		<p>Gretchen, who hadn't had time to stop her lover, grasped her jacket sleeve and pleaded with her to stop. George was out of control in her anger, and she'd kill Josua if Gretchen weren't there. "George, please." She said softly, and watched as George paused, glaring at Josua.</p>
		<p>And then suddenly, she dropped him heavily, kicking him hard in the stomach. Josua groaned, and vomited all over the floor. George grimaced at the stench; Gretchen gagged and turned away. Despite the rancid odor, George kneeled beside him, staring at his bloody face impassively. Evenly, in a deadly calm voice, she said: "You so much as ever, and hear me again, <i>ever</i> go near Cassidy Monsignor with your garbage, I will break much more than your nose."</p>
		<p>Josua shivered with fear, and vomited all over again. George jumped back, out of the flow's way, and glared at him for another minute. Then she turned away and guided Gretchen out of the apartment.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>When they returned to the hospital, they found Jeffrey there with Andrea. With a small groan, George walked inside with Gretchen. Robie stood close by Andrea and Jeffrey, seriously glaring at Jeffrey's back. Jeffrey pointedly ignored her, and was having a quiet discussion with Andrea. She wouldn't look at him, and seemed extremely angry, though she was trying hard to control it.</p>
		<p>Robie moved to George and Gretchen's side as they walked in, muttering under her breath. She took in the spatters of blood on George's jacket and skin, and then calmly studied George's impassive face. "What did you do?" She asked softly.</p>
		<p>George shook her head in a don't-ask-any-questions way. "Nothing." She replied shortly, then glanced in Andrea's direction. "What's up?" She asked.</p>
		<p>Robie turned to glare at Jeffrey, who glanced up at her and returned the glare. "This guy is one true bastard!" She whispered vehemently. "He calls Andrea at her cellular, wants to know where she is. When she tells him where and why she's here, he asks her to come home. But of course Andrea said no, and how dare he expect her to leave Cassidy, who needs her so much.</p>
		<p>"So he shows up here, and fumes when he finds my arms around her, ranting about how she's turning into 'one of those women.' And then he goes and says that Cassidy probably has AIDS and all this crap." She crossed her arms and tapped her foot in a fast pace, shaking her head. "Andrea practically told him to fuck off when he said that, and that's when he just shut up and started talking to her really quiet." She smiled slightly; very amused at the insults Andrea threw his way.</p>
		<p>Gretchen chuckled, and George smiled despite her anger. "Any news on Cassidy?" She asked.</p>
		<p>Robie shook her head, her smile faded. "Ashleigh said she is in a coma." She said softly; Gretchen and George murmured and gasped their fear. "They're taking her to a room in ICU in about an hour or so."</p>
		<p>Gretchen pursed her lips thoughtfully. "She hasn't responded to anything?" She asked.</p>
		<p>Robie shook her head. "Nothing, still the same." She said softly, her voice betraying her worry.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Andy," Jeffrey was saying softly, trying not to explode on her. "Come home with me, baby. You're so tired." He was trying to cajole her. She would have none of it, and insisted on not looking at him. He knew he'd made a mistake the moment he yelled those bitter words against Cassidy. As much as he suspected of her sexual involvement with Cassidy, he knew he shouldn't have said a word; he didn't want to loose her. Now she didn't want him to even touch her. He sat beside her, knees pressed against hers; hands clasped in front of him, trying to soft-talk her.</p>
		<p>She stared blankly away from him, occasionally glancing at Robie, Gretchen and George. Andrea thought that Cassidy didn't appreciate her friends. She thought if she was so depressed, so tempted to go into the dark world of drugs, why didn't she talk about it? But it was no time for recriminations, Cassidy might die, and she wouldn't know what to do if she did. She trembled violently, and looked down at her hands resting helplessly on her lap; tears sprang to her eyes.</p>
		<p>"Ah, Andy," Jeffrey whispered, and made a move to hold her.</p>
		<p>Andrea pushed him away. "Get away from me!" She hissed, not able to control her contempt against Jeffrey. "I don't need you here, really." She whispered, trying to be nicer this time. "Just go home."</p>
		<p>Jeffrey shook his head, and glanced at the three women standing close. He wouldn't leave her around these women at any time. "No, I can't leave you here, baby."</p>
		<p>Andrea decided to ignore him, then. She stood up resolutely and went to Robie and the others. Ashleigh came in a few minutes later, and Andrea went to her. Ashleigh smiled down at her, touching her cheek comfortingly. "She's in the Intensive Care room now." She said to them, noticing Jeffrey sitting calmly by the chairs, and her expression hardened visibly. He leered at her, and waved slightly, knowing her dislike towards him. She looked at Andrea, and said: "You should go home and rest now. You've had a hard night." She looked at the others. "The same goes for you too."</p>
		<p>Andrea shook her head, but before she could audibly protest, George said: "She's right, Andrea. You look extremely tired."</p>
		<p>"Thank you." Andrea said, and yawned. "You're right." She looked at Ashleigh. "I'll be here first thing in the morning. Call me if anything comes up, please."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh nodded. "Visiting hours from nine to eight." She informed her, and smiled reassuringly. "But maybe I can arrange something."</p>
		<p>Andrea nodded and smiled warily in return and said goodnight to everyone. She then glanced fleetingly at Jeffrey and said: "I have my own car, Jeffrey. I don't need you to take me home. Goodnight." And she walked out, Jeffrey close at her heels, trying to cajole her into changing her mind.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh, George, Gretchen and Robie were very amused at Andrea's sudden change in attitude towards Jeffrey. It seemed she'd seen what he was really all about, and could barely stand his company now.</p>
