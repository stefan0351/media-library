<!-- A Sweet Surrender \ Chapter Fourteen -->

<p>Ashleigh could see the bags under Cassidy's eyes as she sipped on her tea. Cassidy sat across from her, her eyes eloquently revealing her despair. She was silent, seemingly empty inside, her only movements being those of bringing herself to the small café and of sipping from her cup the hard liquor that Ashleigh had been trying to prevent her from drinking. She had an idea of what had happened, getting the story from Andrea herself, who sounded as bad as Cassidy looked.</p>
		<p>It had been over a month since they'd last seen one another, and the pain was palpable.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh wondered why Cassidy had not told Andrea the truth of her feelings when she had the chance, and called her friend on it. Cassidy just shrugged and didn't say much more. She seemed to have given up hope on life. She wasn't working, she wasn't writing, and Joel was becoming worried about her. He even called Ashleigh, whom he knew to be her doctor, to find out "what could possibly be wrong with Cassidy."</p>
		<p>George had called Ashleigh too on behalf of herself and Gretchen; they'd both had dinner only once during that month with Cassidy, who had seemed to them empty inside. Robie was very worried, Cassidy would cry in her arms when they spent time together, had completely shut down in every way they'd had connections. She never smiled any more. She was in a complete emotional shutdown. She was much thinner, was obviously not eating much and drinking more, and was not worrying about her health, which still needed care.</p>
		<p>Cassidy took a deep breath and sat back on her chair, fingering the glass of alcohol with her strong fingers, her watery eyes fastened onto the shiny exterior of the glass. "I have to go." She finally said in a hoarse lifeless voice. "I promised my friend Josua I'd go see him today."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh felt her heart shiver at the sight of her friend, who was basically going backwards in time to the emotional mess she was ten years before. "I want to speak with you, Cassidy." Ashleigh said pleadingly, trying to pry through the wall Cassidy had built for herself. "I miss you."</p>
		<p>Cassidy's practically emotionless expression didn't change, but her shoulders slouched. "There's nothing to speak about," She said shortly, and stood up from her chair abruptly. She fished into her pocket and threw a bill onto the tabletop, walking away from the table without another word.</p>
		<p>She was gone by the time Ashleigh reached the street, trying to stop her. Ashleigh felt her heart ache, felt the tears coming to her eyes as she thought of what Cassidy was capable of doing to herself. She pulled her cellular out of her jacket pocket and dialed.</p>
		<p>She left a message on Cassidy's machine, hoping that she was at least checking the messages. "Listen, you left, and didn't even let me tell you that George and Gretchen asked me to let you know to meet us at Crystal Bar next Friday night, we'll be there at about ten. They were celebrating Gretchen's victory in the courts last week. You better be there, or I'll go find you at your place."</p>
		<p>Andrea had withdrawn from Jeffrey, would hardly let him touch her, and he instantly knew something had changed in her. He already suspected what it was, and was already planning his revenge. Not on Andrea, but on Cassidy. Something told him she had changed his beautiful lover, had completely locked her doors to him. He demanded to know if they'd made love, and Andrea didn't have the sense to admit or deny anything.</p>
		<p>She'd taken time off work, asking for a week or so, finding that her emotions were getting the better of her, and that she couldn't concentrate on her lessons. The school gladly gave her the time she needed, sensing her addlebrained anguish. She'd break down in tears in the middle of a class, was coming in with dark bags under her eyes, and couldn't keep her hands still long enough to even write on the blackboards. The school was afraid she was having a nervous breakdown, and welcomed the opportunity for her to be able to deal with her problems. They valued her talent with the students and hoped that she could relax and come back the same Andrea she was before.</p>
		<p>Jeffrey, on the other hand, demanded and demanded to know <i>now</i> what was happening to her, why she was withdrawing from him in that way. She refused to even look at him, pleading for him to give her time, to leave her be for a while.</p>
		<p>She didn't know how to deal with the knowledge that she was helplessly in love with Cassidy, and that Cassidy had all but told her she didn't feel the same way.</p>
