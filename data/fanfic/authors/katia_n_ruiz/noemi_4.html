<!-- Noemí \ Chapter Four -->

<p>Victoria climbed into the passenger seat, her dark curly hair looking unruly, her clothes wrinkled. She lived two blocks away from Noemí, at another one of those large houses that ruled the area. Noemí looked her over closely. "Had a good time?" She asked teasingly as she drove away. This was the first time ever that she had seen Victoria looking so rumpled and tired after a long night of lovemaking.</p>
		<p>Victoria yawned. "Jesus, if I knew she'd keep me awake the whole night, I would have told you to forget it." She said, her voice groggy. "What impression am I going to make on this girl, you know?" Victoria was one of those firm believers in the fact that <i>every</i> single straight woman had to switch at some point in her life. So far, she had been mostly proven correct; almost every single straight woman that she had met had ended up in her bed at some point, doing things for her they would have never found themselves doing for any man.</p>
		<p>"You are a pompous, conceited Individual." Noemí said laughingly, reaching over and pinching her cheek. "Up until three weeks ago, this woman was sleeping with my brother."</p>
		<p>"So?" Victoria countered, slapping her hand away. Then she looked at her suspiciously. "Who are you and what have you done with my best friend? Are you actually smiling?" She asked, and then hooted and slapped her thigh as Noemí smiled. "I haven't seen a smile coming from that beautiful face in so long; I forgot what it looked like!" She reached over and kissed her cheek noisily, despite the fact that the car swerved.</p>
		<p>Noemí righted the car as Victoria pulled away from her and slipped on her seatbelt. "You look gorgeous, Vicki." Noemí said as Victoria twisted the rearview mirror and looked at herself. "And what's with this Michaela Cavanaugh of the Cavanaugh horses?" She asked, giving her friend a side-glance.</p>
		<p>Victoria shrugged, as if it weren't a big deal; Noemí could see that it was. "I met her a few days ago. I'm her father's accountant. He owns a horse farm a few miles outside of New York City, very well known, plus he owns an incredible advertising company. She works for him, and he sent her into my office to review the books with me. He's planning on retiring from the advertising agency soon, and she's taking over." Her smile grew, took on a dreamy quality. "So the third day we meet, she sits there with me, and she looks so good, and smells like an angel. Estrogen is working overtime and I invite her to dinner at my place, and she says yes. The next thing I know, there we are for like five hours, non-stop." She looked accusingly at Noemí, but she couldn't help the fondness that showed through her eyes. "Until a certain important person in my life calls me." Her attempt at giving Noemí even a semblance of an angry glance was foiled, and she smiled fully.</p>
		<p>Noemí nodded and smiled softly. "She's a fast mover, looks to me, just like you." She said. "Looks like you found your match." She arched an eyebrow at Victoria, who laughed, dismissing her words as a tease.</p>
		<p>Victoria fell asleep as Noemí drove to Terri's house, and jumped in her seat as Noemí shook her awake. "God, I didn't know I was so tired." She whined as they got out of the car. She looked around at the area, then at the building, and made a disgusted face. "Yuck, this is ugly!" She looked at Noemí, who was wearing a white T-shirt and thin gray sweats and white Nike sneakers, comfortable in the heat. "At least <i>you</i> match with our surroundings."</p>
		<p>Going to the steps, Noemí didn't answer as she pushed the door open and walked through, followed by Victoria. She climbed the steps to the second floor and looked at the doors. There was an apartment on either side of the hall, running the length of the house. The hall smelled like old garbage and urine, and Victoria pinched her nose closed with a gag. Noemí slapped her hand from her nose and knocked on the door to their left. "Who is it?" Noemí recognized Terri's muffled voice and smiled, looking at Victoria.</p>
		<p>"It is Noemí, with a friend. We've come to talk about the situation." She replied with her mouth close to the door. She pulled back and waited.</p>
		<p>The door swung open, and Victoria released a low whistle behind Noemí. Terri was attractive in worn gray shorts and a white T-shirt; her dark hair was wet and her long bangs were matted across her forehead wetly. She was barefoot. Her skin was flushed from her shower and she didn't meet Noemí's eyes as she stepped away from the entrance and gestured Noemí and Victoria in. Victoria walked in and stood right besides her, seemingly forgetting their surroundings. She extended her hand and grinned flirtatiously as she introduced herself. "My name is Victoria Terrence, and allow me to tell you that Anthony is a big jerk for doing what he's done to such a beautiful woman as yourself." She said all in one breath, and Noemí wondered at how much practice she got.</p>
		<p>Terri shook her hand and smiled shyly. "Nice to meet you." She said in a low voice. "I'm Terri Bledsoe."</p>
		<p>"Well, Terri," Victoria said with a warm voice. "Let me tell you that it is a great pleasure meeting <i>you</i>-"</p>
		<p>"Cut the bullshit, Victoria, this is serious." Noemí cut off her banter icily. Victoria lifted her hands in a peace gesture and as Terri turned to Noemí, she gave her a once over and shot Noemí a sign of approval. Noemí shook her head and looked around at the apartment. Terri stared at her, crossing her arms protectively over her chest. She looked at Noemí's bandaged hand and looked embarrassed. She could see the long scar she'd spied in the car, and saw that it ran up her arm from her wrist to the crook of her elbow, and she felt even worse to have added the most minimal scar to her hand. Noemí saw her look and smiled reassuringly. "Don't worry about the hand, it is fine. Now, can we sit and discuss this like adults? Without the charade of yesterday?"</p>
		<p>"Yes." Terri gestured them to sit on her only chairs, two table chairs in the kitchen. The apartment turned out to be a studio; it was even smaller than Noemí thought. The bed was a twin size and it sat on a corner of the room, the kitchenette was on the other side. There was another door that presumably led to the bathroom. There were only three windows, one by the kitchenette, the others by the bed. Terri seemed embarrassed with their surroundings and she looked down at the worn wood floor. There were paintings all over the walls and Noemí stared at them. "Mind if I look at these, Ms. Bledsoe?" She asked Terri, and was answered with a brief nod.</p>
		<p>Victoria stood beside her and both women studied, with growing admiration, the works of art hanging with scotch tape on the walls. They were on regular white paper. Watercolors mixed and used so cleverly and beautifully to depict forests, people, the city. Touched, Noemí turned to stare at Terri. "You are very clever with colors, Ms. Bledsoe." She said softly, knowing she guessed correctly by the pleased flush on Terri's cheeks, smiling softly. "My mother is an avid admirer of art, and she would enjoy looking at these works of yours. Are watercolors the only thing you use?" She was aware of Victoria's eyes still captured by the pretty drawings.</p>
		<p>Terri blushed with pleasure at the compliment, and she shook her head. "It's all I can afford." She whispered softly, and continued to stare at the floor.</p>
		<p>Noemí walked up closer, and bent to meet her eyes. "Can you try looking at me, Ms. Bledsoe?" She asked softly, and Terri straightened to look into her eyes. "Good," Noemí said, and gestured to the chairs. Terri hesitated and looked at Victoria, who was engrossed with every single detail of each painting. "Sit down, she's a big girl. You need all the comfort." Noemí reassured her, a hand on her arm. Terri sat and rubbed her hands together, staring down at her feet. "Look at me, Ms. Bledsoe."</p>
		<p>"Terri is fine," Terri whispered, and met her eyes, they were the brave gray-brown that Noemí had been remembering the whole night. "Have you spoken to your brother?" She asked suddenly, suddenly gaining valor. "Has he confirmed or has he lied?"</p>
		<p>Noemí sat at the edge of the chair, and rested her elbows on her knees, forcing their eyes to remain in contact. "I spoke to my parents, we spoke to Anthony, and we have reason to believe you. My parents would like to meet you; they would like to know you. We know that your baby may be Anthony's, just because he slept with you without protection," Noemí said.</p>
		<p>"I used the pill-" Terri said.</p>
		<p>Noemí cut her off, waving her hand. "I know, Anthony seemed to think that was enough of a reason for you not to be pregnant. But my mother has first hand knowledge on accidental pregnancies." She said, and felt Victoria's eyes on them, though she remained politely silent, leaning against the wall. After a brief pause, she said: "Now, they'd like to meet you this afternoon, if that is possible for you."</p>
		<p>Terri sat wide-eyed, staring into Noemí's eyes. "This afternoon?" She squeaked. "I don't have the clothes-"</p>
		<p>Noemí lifted a hand to stop her, and smiled softly. "You don't need to worry about clothes with my parents, the smallest things impress them, like intelligence. Just be nice, not the person I met yesterday." Noemí said teasingly, and sat back on the chair. "What do you say?"</p>
		<p>"What about Anthony?" Terri asked softly, ignoring the tease in Noemí's voice. She was totally unnerved by this Noemí, the one that was pleasant, and who smiled, even if it was only a tiny little bit; the difference from yesterday threw Terri off.</p>
		<p>Noemí took a deep breath, and glanced briefly at Victoria. "Anthony has been cut loose, basically, and he will have to fend for himself." Noemí answered. When Terri looked guilty, she explained truthfully: "He has a good inheritance from an uncle, and he will live off it. He wants nothing to do with you or the child." She paused, letting the truth sink in. "He refused to even think about marriage, and that, in my father's eyes, did it."</p>
		<p>Terri sat up. "I don't want to marry Anthony, he's irresponsible and a brat. And I don't feel anything for him." She blurted, and blushed at Noemí's expression. "I'm sorry, he's your brother."</p>
		<p>Noemí chuckled and shook her head. "I understand completely how you feel." She said truthfully. "I tell you, that if he were here, I'd break his filthy mouth. He denied having anything to do with you, then eventually admitted it, when I told him what you knew about his... anatomy."</p>
		<p>Terri's skin flushed a deeper shade of red. "In- in front of your parents?" She asked meekly.</p>
		<p>Victoria chuckled. "Trust me, Ms. Bledsoe, Mr. and Mrs. Leone are no saints." She said.</p>
		<p>Terri looked at Victoria and smiled tentatively, then her eyes returned to Noemí and looked anxious. "Now?" She asked.</p>
		<p>"Yes." Noemí replied.</p>
		<p>"Oh, come on," Victoria said, and kneeled beside Noemí, smiling up at Terri. "Her folks are not that bad, when they've managed to deal with me practically my whole life. And trust me, I'm definitely no saint myself."</p>
		<p>Terri smiled uncertainly. "I might as well get it over with, right?" Both Noemí and Victoria smiled and nodded reassuringly. "Okay, can you wait for me downstairs? As you can see," She made a sweeping motion with her hand. "I have no place to change, but right in front of you."</p>
		<p>Victoria rose and grinned playfully. "Oh, we wouldn't mi-" She began to say, but Noemí jumped to her feet and pulled her towards the door.</p>
		<p>"We'll be in the car." She said over her shoulder, and they left Terri alone in the apartment, wondering what Anthony had gotten her into.</p>
		<p>"Are you crazy?" Noemí demanded, glaring at Victoria through the rearview mirror.</p>
		<p>Victoria sat comfortably on the backseat, her head resting against the arms, her legs resting across the seat. She yawned, and smiled lazily. "She doesn't look pregnant to me." She said.</p>
		<p>"Well, she is. You just can't see it yet, you can feel it though." Noemí said to her, gripping the steering wheel.</p>
		<p>"And how, my friend, did you feel her stomach?" Victoria asked with arched eyebrows.</p>
		<p>"Well," Noemí was embarrassed. "When we had the fight, I had to drag her up the block to the parking lot."</p>
		<p>"I see." Victoria laughed softly. "Feisty little thing, isn't she? Didn't seem that way to me up there."</p>
		<p>"I guess she got it out of her system." Noemí said, leaning over and looking out the passenger window. "What's taking her so long?"</p>
		<p>"Well, buddy," Victoria said flippantly. "Think about this. She is the poorest of the poor, probably has nothing, <i>nothing</i>, at all to wear that she feels is dignified of a super rich family." She flipped her wrist. "You tell me why she's taking so long."</p>
		<p>"I wonder what she lives off of." Noemí wondered aloud.</p>
		<p>"Probably welfare." Victoria said with another yawn.</p>
		<p>"That is not nice, Victoria." Noemí admonished. "I thought you were nicer."</p>
		<p>"I am, baby," Victoria said smoothly, and leaned forward on her seat, throwing her arms over the front seats. "I'm just being practical." She paused. "She's gorgeous, Noemí. God, did you see those eyes? And that body?"</p>
		<p>"Mom says pregnancy always makes women beautiful." Noemí said distractedly, leaning over again and looking out the window.</p>
		<p>"No, my love, she is a natural beauty, the pregnancy has enhanced her beauty even more." Victoria corrected her, then sat back and mused with a smile. "I've never made love to a pregnant woman before."</p>
		<p>"Victoria, stop it." Noemí said in a warning tone.</p>
		<p>"So tell me," Victoria said, restlessly leaning forward again. "What do you know about pregnant women?"</p>
		<p>Noemí twisted around to look at Victoria as if she were crazy. "What?" She exclaimed.</p>
		<p>Victoria smiled and touched Noemí's face as if she were loosing her mind. "Pay attention, will you?" She said in a playfully impatient voice. "She is a very pregnant woman with a volatile temper. You want to take her to live in your house, where you will have to deal with her bullshit for God knows how long. We all know that Ms. Noemí Leone is not the most patient individual on this earth, hence her restlessness at this very moment. <i>What do you know about pregnant women</i>?"</p>
		<p>Noemí turned and stared out the windshield, and remembered. "Amelia was pregnant." She said softly, sorrow burning her heart.</p>
		<p>Victoria shifted over and wrapped her arms around her shoulders. "Oh, honey, I know," She whispered softly against her ear. "I know she was pregnant, but Amelia was always happy, God bless her soul. It was what you both wanted so badly. But Terri will not take the place of Amelia, honey. She is a straight pregnant woman."</p>
		<p>Noemí nodded. "I know, Victoria." She said softly, holding Victoria's hands tightly in her own. "I just want to do for her what Anthony is not doing. I want to give that baby all it needs, so that it never needs anything in its life. I'm convincing Terri to take my offer to live in the house; the other bedroom is so beautiful. Besides, it would be as if she is living there on her own, I'm hardly ever there as it is."</p>
		<p>The passenger door opened, stopping Victoria from saying anything more. She sat back and slipped on her seatbelt. "Noe, take me home first. Michaela is waiting for me there." She said with a little smile and a wink.</p>
		<p>"Oh, is she?" Noemí asked with a smile. To Terri, she says: "We're taking a little detour."</p>
		<p>Terri nodded, and Noemí drove off.</p>
		<p>Thomas and Natalie sat on their comfortable lawn chairs in their patio; each enjoyed a cold glass of lemon iced tea prepared expertly by Natalie. Saturday was René's day off. They looked up at blue sky, partly shielded from the sun by the trees surrounding the house. Holding hands, they sat close together. Thomas, wearing a light blue tank top shirt, was feeling comfortable as they waited for Noemí to show up with Terri Bledsoe. Natalie wore white shorts with a white T-shirt, comfortable under the warm sunshine.</p>
		<p>"Oh, honey," Natalie said sadly. "I wish Anthony would change his mind, and at least be there for that child. He thinks having children is like tying yourself down. We never taught him that."</p>
		<p>"I'm sure plenty of his friends tell him that, he is so easily influenced." Thomas replied, and took a good mouthful from his iced tea. They heard the sudden sound of a car door slamming, and they both sat up expectantly, suddenly nervous. "They're here." He whispered, and stood up.</p>
		<p>Two minutes later, Noemí was guiding a very reluctant looking young woman up to them. "Oh, Thomas, she's beautiful." Natalie breathed close to his ear, and sighed as Noemí guided the young woman to stand in front of them.</p>
		<p>Thomas stared down at the young woman with a smile on his handsome face. "Well, hello there, Ms. Bledsoe." He said, and extended his hand.</p>
		<p>"Hello mom, dad." Noemí said as Terri reached to shake her father's hand. She leaned towards her mother and planted a tender kiss on her cheek. "Hi, mom."</p>
		<p>"Hi, baby," Natalie said, kissing her back. Then Terri became the center of their attention, and the shy demeanor mixed with strong pride charms her. "Hello, Terri, I am Natalie, and this is my husband Thomas. Come, sit down with us." She said and gestured her to sit on one of the chairs around the table. Terri complied, and sat staring down at the ground in silence as they studied her. Noemí sat beside her mother and remained politely detached, letting them do their thing. "Tell us, Terri," Natalie said suddenly, and Terri's eyes snapped up to her. "Are you originally from New York?"</p>
		<p>Terri shook her head and took a deep breath. "No, I'm originally from Pennsylvania." She responded and met her eyes, then Thomas'. Suddenly, she felt flustered at having to be under their scrutiny, as if she was a lab specimen under observation. "Listen, I am sorry that this is happening this way, I never wanted to take advantage of Anthony's situation. I was taking the pill every day and I didn't stop. I was as surprised as he was to find that I was pregnant. I just don't believe in abortion, and if I did, I- don't think I'd have the courage anyway." She met Noemí's eyes, giving her the reason she had almost broken her mouth back at the office. Noemí acknowledged her reason, and smiled reassuringly, reaching up with her hand and rubbing the bruised spot of her jaw.</p>
		<p>Thomas, charmed by the straightforward nature of this young woman, sat forward and rested his elbows on his knees like Noemí had done back at her apartment. Terri could see how alike their mannerisms were. She thought of Anthony, and of how his mannerisms were not at all like his parents'. Thomas' gentle voice brought her out of her thoughts. "Noemí mentioned you had brothers and a father. If it is not too much, may we ask why you left them?" He asked.</p>
		<p>Terri shook her head. "I prefer not to talk about the circumstances of my departure from home, sir, if you don't mind." She said softly, and was strangely comforted by the look of sympathy in his eyes.</p>
		<p>"Understood, young woman." Thomas said indulgently, smiling tenderly, already liking her honesty. "Maybe some day we can talk about it?" She nodded, and he smiled at her. "We need to know some other things, also." She nodded again, and he asked: "What physician has seen you about your pregnancy?"</p>
		<p>"I go to the clinic with Jamaica Hospital. It's called Medisys, and they help you get medical assistance even if you don't have welfare." Terri answered truthfully, meeting his eyes and fidgeting in her seat. "They helped me get into welfare, so now I have Medicaid. I don't see a regular physician, sir."</p>
		<p>Thomas lifted a hand and smiled at her. "Thomas is fine, dear." He assured her.</p>
		<p>"It seems like a disrespect to you, sir." She said.</p>
		<p>Thomas laughed softly, and then lifted a finger and wagged it at her. "Let me tell you something, Terri, just because we're rich, we don't ask people who are not as fortunate as us to call us by the words Sir or Madam. Makes us feel old." He said, and Natalie nodded her agreement. "Our maid, which we've had for over twenty-seven years, calls us by first name basis, and we've never required her to call us any other way." He paused and looked her straight in the eyes, with those eyes so similar to Noemí's. "Now, about the doctor. You will see our family physician from now on."</p>
		<p>"But," Terri stuttered.</p>
		<p>Thomas cut her off gently. "Now, you have nothing to hide," Terri shook her head, her mouth hanging open. She looked at Noemí with wide eyes. Thomas smiles at his daughter, who is sitting there, very quiet, smiling at Terri softly, reassuring her. "And," Thomas continued. "Since there is a great possibility that child is Anthony's-"</p>
		<p>"I don't want to be disrespectful, sir, er, Thomas," Terri said apologetically. "But I swear on my life and my baby's that I have never been with any other man. Please, believe me." Her eyes grew moist and her voice broke a little.</p>
		<p>Thomas reached over and took her small hand in his, squeezing gently before letting go, touched by her sensitivity. "Okay, Terri, you have to understand how we feel. We want to be sure that this child is Anthony's. When that child is born, we'll know. In the meantime, just because Anthony committed the irresponsible act of having unsafe sex with you, we feel responsible to you." He said softly, and Natalie agreed with him. "We are going to provide for you and your unborn baby, as if you were part of our family. The money that was going to Anthony, will be coming to you, and we will pay for your medical expenses."</p>
		<p>Terri stared at him, dumbfounded; her face was pale. "I-"</p>
		<p>"Now," Thomas cut her off once again. "About your living arrangement." He glanced at Noemí, and she nodded softly. "Noemí has commented about the area you live in. We don't want you there any more. Noemí has enough room in her own home to provide comfort for you." He chuckled softly at her shocked stare, and watched as she looked from him to Natalie and then to Noemí.</p>
		<p>"No," She said suddenly, her face tense. "I can't accept." She stood, and made a move to walk away. Noemí moved quickly and stood in front of her, taking a hold of her arms. "Please, let me go, Noemí. I will take the train home, I can't accept this."</p>
		<p>Thomas gestured to Noemí and she nodded. "Why don't we go have a drink somewhere?" She suggested to Terri.</p>
		<p>"I can't drink, my baby-" Terri begins to say, but Noemí smiles down at her.</p>
		<p>"You can have orange juice, and I'll have a drink." She said, and winked at her parents, guiding her away. "We'll be back in a little while." She called over her shoulder, but her parents followed them around the house to the driveway, obviously reluctant to see Terri go.</p>
		<p>Terri got into the car, and slipped on her seatbelt. She waited for Noemí to get into the car also, but Noemí was talking to her parents, hands shoved into her sweats' pockets. She rocked on the heels of her sneakers, and Terri could only hear the sound of their voices, their words undecipherable. Thomas said something to Noemí and glanced at Terri, smiling at her. She nodded at him and smiled back, blushing in embarrassment. She crossed her arms protectively over her chest and stared down at her feet.</p>
		<p>She wondered at their willingness to help her, even though they didn't know her. Obviously, they had been expecting this to happen for a long time. That they were even willing to support her surprised her even more. For all they knew, she could be lying, trying to get good money at their expense. They were so trusting that it was difficult for her not to like them already. She had had preconceived notions, by seeing the way Anthony was, that they were morons. Now she knew she was wrong, even though she still had her doubts.</p>
		<p><i>I should have known better, I guess.</i> She thought to herself. <i>Noemí Leone is nothing like Anthony. She is so intense and serious, and intelligent, that I can see by the way she talks, walks, and even sits. Obviously, Anthony's Parents did something right where Noemí Leone is concerned.</i></p>
		<p>Suddenly, Noemí opened the driver's side door and leaned in. "Let's go take a walk, there is a little place close by we can go to." She said, meeting her eyes.</p>
		<p>Terri nodded and came out of the car. She looked at Thomas and Natalie, her expression apologetic. "I'm sorry." She said softly, and follows Noemí down the long driveway onto the sidewalk.</p>
		<p>Thomas and Natalie watched them silently as they went, walking slowly down to Austin Street. "Why should she be sorry?" Natalie whispered at Thomas and he shrugged.</p>
		<p>He turned and wrapped his arms around his wife, smiling down at her. "Maybe she doesn't want the comfort we can provide for her." He said softly, kissing her lips gently. "She'll have to take it, whether she wants it or not. For that child she's carrying."</p>
