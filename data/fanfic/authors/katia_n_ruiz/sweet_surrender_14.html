<!-- A Sweet Surrender \ Chapter Thirteen -->

<p>Jeffrey rang the bell to Andrea's apartment and waited, soon realizing with a frown that she wasn't there when he she didn't answer. He'd arrived very late the night before from his business trip, and wanted to see Andrea immediately. He missed her immensely, and wanted to be with her right away. But he knew that she would be already sleeping, for she worked the next day.</p>
		<p>So he went at a time that he knew she would be there after work, but to his discomfort she wasn't. He left, frowning and fingering his chin thoughtfully.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Andrea lay in the comfort of Cassidy's arms, breathing deeply after an intense round of lovemaking. She pressed her face into the smooth curve of Cassidy's neck, wrapped her arms around her neck tightly. She could feel the sweat drying coolly on her skin, her forehead covered with moist wavy hair. Beneath her shaking hands, - hands that were pressed against the smooth muscled back, - and pressed softly against the front of her, was sweaty taut skin. "Cassidy," She whispered against her throat, and kissed the skin there, feeling Cassidy shiver against her. "I-"</p>
		<p>Cassidy pulled back and kissed her hard on the lips, pressing her tongue deep into her mouth and flicking it against hers tenderly. Andrea groaned, took her in once again, arousal exploding through her body in a flash. She wanted to talk though, but she found that Cassidy would turn away when she tried to talk about what was happening between them, and she'd make Andrea forget with just a kiss of her lips.</p>
		<p>Later, breathing hard after another passionate session of lovemaking, Andrea sat up in bed, staring down at Cassidy. Cassidy lay on her side with her eyes closed, but Andrea could tell by her breathing that she was awake. "Cassidy, look at me." Andrea said softly, pleading gently. Cassidy looked up at her with wary gold-brown eyes. "Why won't you talk to me anymore?" She asked, but Cassidy simply stared at her.</p>
		<p>Cassidy sat up also, and crossed her legs, resting her elbows on her knees and holding her head between her hands. She said nothing, struggling within herself against the temptation to tell Andrea that she was very much in love with her. She then lifted her head and shook it. "I can't." She said softly, her voice hoarse. She shifted back and leaned against the headboard.</p>
		<p>"Why?" Andrea demanded. "I try to talk to you, and you won't even <i>let</i> me. I try to tell you how I feel, and you won't <i>listen</i> to me." Andrea felt the hurt she was trying to ignore, the feeling that Cassidy just wanted her for the intense sex that they shared. "Am I just something of an entertainment to you? Is that all I am? Are you not interested in knowing how I feel?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy didn't deny it, knowing it was easier to end what she felt was a mistake by lying. Andrea didn't love her, she was sure; not in the way that she loved <i>her</i>. She felt Andrea tense beside her, and say with a hurt voice: "Is that all I am? A cheap thrill, something to give you gratification?" She trailed off.</p>
		<p>Cassidy turned her face to look at her, and saw the tears in her eyes, steeling herself against the hurt in her heart. She watched stoically while Andrea sat staring at her, the tears sliding down her cheeks. "You are worst than a man," Andrea said bitterly, her voice hard, letting anger at Cassidy's reticence control her. "You use your own best friend for your sexual gratification, for your satisfaction. You won't even let me speak to you, just take me to bed and fuck me." Cassidy tried not to flinch at the words being bitterly thrown her way. Andrea was saying: "You took advantage of my vulnerability, of my need for closeness. Because Jeffrey?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy exploded, shocking Andrea. "Don't bring him into this!" She screamed, and scrambled from the bed. In a moment of fury, with a sweep of her arm, she slammed one of her beautiful chairs across the bedroom. Andrea stared after her, not moving an inch when Cassidy moved towards her. She leaned against the bed, holding herself up with her hands against the mattress, looking directly into Andrea's eyes. "He doesn't have anything to do with this, with what happened between us!" She whispered vehemently, allowing her dislike of him to finally show. Her skin was red with her anger, Andrea saw, and her eyes were blazing.</p>
		<p>Cassidy continued through clenched teeth: "You weren't thinking of him <i>one</i> moment you were here, with me," She pulled away. "When my fingers were inside you, when my mouth was between your legs." She turned back to the bed, leaning over again, and her face close to Andrea's. "When I made love to you, like no one ever has." She stopped again, taking in Andrea's increasingly aware expression. "<i>You</i> took advantage of me, <i>you</i> made me want you, <i>and you</i> were the one who didn't want this to stop when I wanted to stop it! I asked you, a week ago exactly, if you thought we should stop. <i>You</i> broke down, you followed <i>me.</i> It's all been you, Andrea." She was hurting inside.</p>
		<p>She stood up straight and pulled away tensely, going towards her window and standing in front of it without saying a word for a long time. "I think you should leave," She finally said, quietly now, the anger seemed to drain with the sag of her shoulders. She sounded sad, full of despair. "You'll never understand what I'm feeling in here," She touched her chest. "The pain, the?" Her voice broke with the dam that held back her tears. "I'm dying inside?"</p>
		<p>Andrea stood up from the bed, walking slowly towards her, wanting to hold her in her arms, to comfort her. But Cassidy pulled away, as if sensing her nearness. "Just go!" She said softly, her eyes closed in her sorrow. "Just go? to your Jeffrey, to your straight life. I have no place in it."</p>
		<p>Andrea couldn't help the tears that were lining her eyes; she began crying. "Cassidy-" She sobbed; she couldn't go, she couldn't just go like that. She loved her, she knew. She knew that she was falling in love with her at that very moment when Cassidy was asking her to leave, pushing her away like a rag doll. "I love you."</p>
		<p>Cassidy shook her head in disregard for her words. "And I love you too," She whispered evenly, but kept shaking her head. "But you have Jeffrey, who wants to marry you, who loves you-" She stopped, feeling her heart break into smaller pieces.</p>
		<p>"More than <i>you</i>?" Andrea asked softly, wanting to hear her say No. Wanting to feel Cassidy's strong arms wrap lovingly around her body and take her to new levels of love.</p>
		<p>But Cassidy wanted to hurt, she wanted pain. So she said, not looking into her eyes: "Yes, more."</p>
		<p>Andrea sobbed, stumbling back away from her as if she'd just been slapped, feeling her heart break like she never thought it would break. "You don't mean that!" She whispered tearfully, and tried to look into Cassidy's eyes, but Cassidy avoided hers. "You can't-" Her voice broke and she ran for her clothes, strewn all over the apartment, sobbing, slipping them on frantically and carelessly.</p>
		<p>She gathered her stuff and left without saying another word to Cassidy, painfully aware that Cassidy had remained in the bedroom, not bothering to stop her. Cassidy heard the door close, her own eyes closing as two heavy tears slid down each cheek. She lay down on her bed, aware of the scent that belonged to Andrea, which was stuck all over her, the pillows, the sheets, the bed itself.</p>
		<p>Which hung in the air, spraying memories into Cassidy's mind and making her sob loudly, feeling her heart dying even as it pumped.</p>
