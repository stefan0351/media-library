<!-- Noemí \ Chapter Sixteen -->

<p>Beaming, Natalie began to open her presents. They all sat in the living room; her family and close friends surrounded Natalie. She lifted the cover from a box and grinned, lifting the two pairs- one red and one blue- of stockings Renee hand knitted for her. She grinned at Renee, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "Thank you." She said, kicking off her shoes and slipping on the red stockings. Everyone knew that Natalie loved walking around the house in stockings.</p>
		<p>The next present she picked up was the one Noemí brought for her. Flashing a smile at her daughter, she opened it quickly. Grinning, she pulled out the bottle of her favorite perfume, Oscar De La Renta, and threw a kiss at her across the room.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled at her mother from her place at the door. She stood there, arms crossed, leaning against the frame. Her eyes searched for Terri and she found that Terri had been looking at her, for some time. Noemí grinned softly, thinking about how beautiful she was, how her lustrous hair framed her face so becomingly, and how the peach colored maternity gown added to the beauty of her pregnant body.</p>
		<p>Terri, noticing the intensity with which Noemí gazed at her, felt herself feeling warm and blushing. She looked away, feeling her face grow hot. The truth was that she had been staring at Noemí for some time, and she could not get enough of seeing the aggressive beauty, the self-possessed pose with which she leaned against the doorframe. Her eyes, with their intensity, made her feel trapped when they gazed at her. Glad to see that face smiling, she thought about the past few weeks.</p>
		<p>Noemí had slowly stopped drinking, and she had spent more and more time in the house with her after work. Working only seven hours, she drove herself more gently and allowed herself to enjoy the house again. In the evenings, she had taken to listening to music while working out in the gym, something she never did before. After that, she came out and sat with Terri, even playing board games with her and talking about nonsensical things. She never touched the bedroom she had shared with Amelia, though, and just the thought of changing anything in it would scare her.</p>
		<p>Sometimes on the weekends, Camilla came over and spent time with Noemí. Terri could tell Camilla didn't like her, by the way Camilla looked at her when Terri walked around the house. Mostly, to Noemí's consternation, Terri tried to keep herself in the bedroom, out of Camilla and Noemí's way, but nevertheless, the looks Camilla gave her when she was around made her cringe. But what bothered her most was when Noemí left with Camilla and would not come back for hours, or until early the next morning. She could not bear to imagine what they were doing all that time.</p>
		<p>She snapped back to attention when everyone laughed and clapped at Victoria's outrageous gift for Natalie: a red silk lingerie nightgown. She couldn't help but feeling like she belonged as she joined in the laughter.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Days turned into weeks. Terri had been introduced as a new addition to their family successfully. Everyone present at Natalie's birthday party, other Leone's that knew the circumstances of Terri's situation, were graceful enough to not talk about it with their friends or anyone present. They liked Terri and they knew that her baby would be a beautiful one, proudly carrying the Leone blood and Terri's beauty.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Weeks turned to months. Christmas was almost here, and Terri's stomach kept growing and growing. She had taken the pregnancy beautifully; her stomach looked so big because she was so small, her dark hair had acquired that sheen of health, her skin a healthier color, even her eyes brightened and she was so obviously happy. No one knew, but Noemí had taken to sleeping in her bed with her every night; when she had tried alone, her anxiety didn't allow her to sleep. Even now, when Terri couldn't hold her, because she was so largely pregnant, Noemí slept with her. She slept across the foot of bed, sometimes, because Terri moved so much now and needed space.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>The second Friday before Christmas Noemí made it home early and found Terri sketching in the living room. She wore shorts and a T-shirt that strained against her bulging stomach; her hair wet and picked up in a ponytail. Her bare feet were tucked under her on the couch. Opening her suit jacket, Noemí sat beside her and peered at the drawing. She recognized the trees in her backyard and smiled. The way Terri brought things to life on paper was a little unnerving to her. Especially because Noemí knew Terri hadn't really had art classes other than the one in High School.</p>
		<p>Terri paused and looked up, smiling shyly at Noemí. "Hi," She said.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled back. "Hello. Have you eaten yet?" She inquired, knowing that when Terri began to draw she forgot about everything.</p>
		<p>Shaking her head sheepishly, Terri said: "No."</p>
		<p>Sighing, Noemí stood and removed her jacket, draping it over her shoulder. "You need to stop doing that, Terri." She admonished, stretching. "It's not only you that you have to think about anymore." She grunted.</p>
		<p>"I know, I just forgot." Terri said.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled softly, and touched her shoulder as she walked past the couch and made her way down the hall. "I'll order out." She said, unbuttoning her shirt as she went into the bathroom to shower.</p>
		<p>"You don't have to." Terri called after her, standing and following her. "I can fix something up." She stopped at the still open bathroom door.</p>
		<p>Removing her shirt, revealing a sports shirt underneath it, Noemí met her eyes and smiled. "Don't worry about it." She said gently, and turned away, kicking off her shoes, and beginning to remove her belt.</p>
		<p>Terri fought to look away from the well-defined arms and back. She cleared her throat and forced herself to turn away.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>As they ate the Fettuccini and veal Noemí ordered, Terri thought about her drawings. She was wondering if Noemí would ever let her really paint her by modeling for her. And if she did, how would she go about bringing Noemí's coppery hair color onto canvas. She was brought out of her thoughts by Noemí's voice. "What?" She said, shaking her head.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled. "Tell me about your family." She said slowly, her eyes looking penetratingly into Terri's. Terri seemed flustered, and Noemí reached over and patted her hand reassuringly. "You seem to know a little more about us than we do about you." She explained. She knew there had been some sort of abuse when Terri was younger, and she need to understand why Terri allowed Anthony to return even after he did what he did to her that first time.</p>
		<p>Terri's shoulders hunched around her ears protectively, and she stared down at her food.</p>
		<p>Noemí was about to tell her to forget it when Terri began to speak.</p>
		<p>"My mother's name was Imogene." Terri began haltingly, swallowing hard. "I don't know how she and my dad met, he never wanted to tell me. I only have a picture of her." She stopped, her shoulders falling away from her ears as if with defeat.</p>
		<p>"You didn't know any of her family?" Noemí asked incredulously. She couldn't imagine not knowing her whole family. It was hard enough realizing she had made hardly any contact with them in three years. "So it was only you, your brothers and your father?"</p>
		<p>Terri nodded, looking up at Noemí. "My mother died when I was born, that's really all I know." She said. "My dad no other family, so it was just us. My brothers always blamed me for my mother's death, and they beat me. Dad didn't really do anything to help me, he used to hit me a lot too." She laughed humorlessly. "Sometimes I wonder how I made it." Her eyes watered, but she held back the tears and clenched her jaw.</p>
		<p>"I'm so sorry." Noemí said softly, reaching for Terri's hand.</p>
		<p>Terri clenched her fist under Noemí's hand, unable to take the gentleness in Noemí's hand and eyes. "No, it wasn't your fault." She said between clenched teeth.</p>
		<p>"My brother did the same to you, didn't he? Except for the hitting part." Noemí said gently, and her gentleness sent a shiver through Terri, was unused to it.</p>
		<p>"I didn't want him that way." Terri whispered, meeting Noemí's eyes.</p>
		<p>Noemí knew the truth of that statement through Terri's eyes. She almost hated her brother for doing this to this young woman, who had to leave her home because of all the abuse she endured as she grew up. That he could take advantage of her situation angered her beyond tears.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Noemí was almost finished with her Christmas shopping. Most of the time during the long weeks before Christmas, Camilla had accompanied her, doing her own shopping also. "I haven't enjoyed Christmas in such a long time." Noemí said.</p>
		<p>It was December twenty-third, and Noemí and Camilla went to finish the last of their shopping.</p>
		<p>"So how is Terri?" Camilla asked Noemí, knowing that Terri, already seven months pregnant with Anthony's child, had Noemí's attention wrapped around her finger.</p>
		<p>"She is fine," Noemí responded as they strolled around the Queens Center Mall, looking around at the stores. She had a smile on her handsome face.</p>
		<p>Camilla slipped her hand into Noemí's, and they walked in companionable silence into JC Penney's. "When is she due?" She asked, trying to keep up the conversation.</p>
		<p>Noemí shrugged and her hand tightened slightly around Camilla's. "Our doctor says sometime in February, which is unbelievable, because she is so big already. I would think she'd be ready now." She said, and laughed softly, her eyes falling momentarily on Camilla. "She's getting cranky already, which is why she didn't look at you twice when I took you to the house. I guess she's used to the peace, or something." She shrugged her wide shoulders again.</p>
		<p>Camilla couldn't take her eyes off Noemí. She looked so good in light brown corduroy trousers, a black turtleneck and black steel-toe boots. Her coat, a waist length, light brown thick Columbia, fit loosely around her torso. She had her hair tucked comfortably into a black winter hat, still glistening with droplets of melted snow. She shifted the numerous bags on her other hand and turned her head to look at Camilla again with a soft smile that brightened her eyes. "I think we've done enough shopping, don't you?"</p>
		<p>Camilla smiled and nodded. She trembled when she saw Noemí's eyes do an once-over on her body, and knew she looked good in the clothing she chose specifically to impress her. Wearing tight blue jeans, black boots, and a red knitted sweater hanging off her generous breasts, she knew Noemí desired her; over it she wore a black shearling jacket. They passed a jewelry store, and she smiled, as Noemí seemed to be pulled like a magnet inside. "Whom are you buying jewelry for?" She asked.</p>
		<p>Noemí's eyes were on the pearl chains and earrings. "Terri." She said absently, putting the bags down and moving along the display case counters. The attendant, standing close by, walked over to her with a friendly smile and she asked him to pull out this and that combination. Camilla could see the soft smile on her face. Noemí had already bought Terri more than three presents, and Camilla couldn't help but feel jealous.</p>
		<p>They weren't in a relationship, but Camilla hoped that Noemí would finally realize that Camilla had fallen in love with her. Everyone at the office already knew of their liaison, and they said nothing, having already been warned by Noemí that if anyone insults Camilla's integrity, they would be fired. No one had anything to say, really, work continued at the same pace regardless of the relationship between Camilla and Noemí.</p>
		<p>Noemí turned to face her, pearl necklace and earrings lifted in her large hands to display for Camilla. "What do you think?" She asked. "It's a present for her, for the Christmas party tomorrow. They'll look perfect with that maternity gown mom bought her for the party." She explained.</p>
		<p>Camilla didn't smile, but Noemí didn't notice, because she had already turned to talk to the shopkeeper, pulling out her credit card.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Terri," Noemí called, walking into the house with bags on hand. She didn't even notice the much warmer temperature in the house; she couldn't wait to give her the earrings and necklace. She dropped the bags next to the door. "Where are you?" She called when she went to the kitchen and didn't find her there. As she returned to the living room, Terri walked in, large stomach bared, tight T-shirt pulled up above it, and shorts pushed down beneath it. Barefoot, she padded her way towards Noemí, a wide-eyed look in her eyes. Noemí could see that she had been sleeping; her hair was a mess over her shoulders. Noemí smiled at her, thinking she looked adorable, and reached into the pocket of her jacket, looking excited. "Look at what I bought you, for tomorrow's party." She said, and walked to her.</p>
		<p>Terri looked at the palm-sized velvet box uncomprehendingly, still not fully awake. Then she smiled uncertainly at Noemí and took the box. "What is it?" She asked with a hoarse voice.</p>
		<p>Noemí grinned, and guided her to the couch with an arm around her shoulders. "Look at it, I think you'll like it." She said gently, helping her sit down without dropping on her weight.</p>
		<p>Terri did, and gasped, her eyes fixed on the pearls. Speechless, her jaw dropped. Her eyes shifted from Noemí back to the contents of the box. "I-"</p>
		<p>Noemí touched a finger to her lips, realizing just how soft and smooth they were. "Don't, I know you like them by the look in your eyes." She said gently, and looked down at the jewelry. "I saw them and I knew they were perfect for you." She leaned forward and kissed Terri softly on the cheek, taking a deep breath and inhaling that sweet fragrance she associated with Terri.</p>
		<p>"It's beautiful, Noemí," Terri whispered, and sat quietly as Noemí's fingers worked nimbly on her tiny studs, removing them and replacing them with the pearls. She watched as Noemí reached into the small box and pulled out the chain of pearls, clasping it around her neck.</p>
		<p>"Lets go see it in the mirror." Noemí said softly, and helped her stand, holding her hand as they walked to the bathroom. Terri gasped softly as they stood under the white light of the bathroom, admiring the way the chain and earrings made her graceful neck even more beautiful. Noemí stood tall behind Terri, her hands on her shoulders, gazing at her reflection in the mirror. "You're beautiful, Terri," She whispered, pressing her lips tenderly against the back of her head, her eyes closed with emotion.</p>
		<p>Terri's lips curved softly into a tentative smile. "Thank you." She whispered, aware of Noemí's body pressed behind her, of her hands on her shoulders, then moving up to trail fingers along her neck. "I love it." She stifled the tremble that began from deep inside her, and met Noemí's incredible eyes in the mirror. Her heart skipped a beat, and she moved away from her, leaving the bathroom and returning to the living room to retrieve the box. Her hands were shaking as she took off the jewelry, and she didn't know what to do to stop it. For weeks now, she had been fighting her intense and growing attraction to Noemí, and she could feel herself loosing the battle. She blamed the pregnancy for this; the raging hormones of pregnancy could be her only explanation for this.</p>
		<p>For the past few weeks, while Noemí hadn't been in the house, she had imagined herself kissing her, had wondered what it would feel like to touch her lips with her own. She had talked to no one of this, not even Victoria, who had become a close friend to her, who visited her almost every day and sat with her and played board games with her to keep her from getting bored. She went with her every other day to the Lamaze classes because Noemí seemed to shut down and freeze even when just the name was mentioned. Sometimes she had been tempted to talk about it, and she knew Victoria sensed something needed talking about, but Terri clamped her mouth shut and said nothing.</p>
		<p>"I made dinner, take your jacket off." She said shortly, and went towards the kitchen.</p>
		<p>"Terri, are you okay?" Noemí asked innocently, following her into the kitchen, removing her jacket.</p>
		<p>"Fine." Terri said shortly, plate in hand, serving her dinner. She gestured her to sit down and placed the plate in front of her.</p>
		<p>Noemí stared at her, confused. "Did I do something wrong?" She asked, and felt foolish when Terri laughed at her, saying that no, she did nothing wrong.</p>
