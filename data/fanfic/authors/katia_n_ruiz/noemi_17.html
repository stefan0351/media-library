<!-- Noemí \ Chapter Seventeen -->

<p>Camilla, already there when Noemí and Terri arrived, talked with Victoria and Michaela. Victoria and Michaela's eyes lit up at the sight of Terri, who was dressed in a graceful green maternity gown that fit her perfectly. Camilla looked her over, and went to Noemí, who took her hand and kissed it softly. "Hi," She whispered.</p>
		<p>Noemí pulled back and looked her over, making a show of licking her lips just for her. "Beautiful," She breathed, and took her into her arms, kissing her softly. "Gorgeous." She whispered against her lips, then pulled back and looked at her again.</p>
		<p>Camilla, pleased that her dress had the effect she desired, grinned. It was low cut, a few inches above her knees, and some cleavage showed, flowing freely from there down. She found the highest heels to accentuate her shapely legs. "I've met most of your family," She said with a smile. "They are wonderful."</p>
		<p>"I'm glad you like them." Noemí said, realizing Terri had left her side. Her eyes found her across the room; talking with her cousin, who introduced her to his teenaged children; he and his family had not been there at Natalie's party. He gestured to her stomach and said something, to which she grinned, patting it proudly and saying something in return.</p>
		<p>Noemí turned to Victoria and Michaela, whistling softly in admiration, and hugged them both. She pulled back and looked them over. Michaela wore a classy and impossibly tight red gown; red lipstick made her sexy lips thicker and sexier. She had her hair picked up in a bun behind her head, with strands dropping out prettily over her cheeks. Victoria sported a two-piece suit, almost like a tuxedo, without the bow. She had just cut her hair into a short curly mass and looked very handsome. "You two look great!" Noemí said with a smile.</p>
		<p>"So do you." Camilla said, fingering the sleeve of her sweater. Noemí's sweater, a loose beige V-neck, fit her torso perfectly; she wore it over a white round-neck T-shirt, pleated black trousers and black shoes. Her hair fell over her forehead, like usual, and shone. She looked comfortable and handsome at the same time.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled at her and pulled her close to plant a kiss on her forehead. "I have to find my parents." She said, pulling away. "Be right back."</p>
		<p>Natalie and Thomas stood together in the center of his studio, surrounded by their family and friends, speaking with Natalie's older brother, Daniel. "Hi, uncle!" Noemí said when he took her into his arms in a bear hug, happy to see her smile again. She had always been his favorite niece, because unlike his own daughters and other nieces, she had always liked to do things he liked to do. As she grew up, he used to take her fishing with him, and they used to play football with his sons and other nephews.</p>
		<p>With the promise that they would go fishing after the winter was gone, he left her to talk to her parents. Natalie wrapped her arms around her daughter, grabbing her face and pulling her down, kissing her tenderly on the forehead. "Hi, mom." Noemí said with a big smile and her felt her dad touch her back gently.</p>
		<p>"How are you, my love?" Her mother asked, smiling up at her tall daughter and wrapping her arms around her waist to pull her into an embrace. "Where is Terri?"</p>
		<p>Noemí nodded and hugged her mother, beaming a smile at her father. "I'm great, merry Christmas." She answered and kissed them each. "And Terri is somewhere in the living room with Joseph."</p>
		<p>She left them to find Terri and went back to look for Camilla, wanting to dance a little; the softly playing music felt nice. She ran into René, who bustled about bossing around the caterers, and wrapped her arms around her ample waist, pulling her off her feet and spinning her around. René slapped her on the arm when she put her down and kissed her cheek lingeringly, the expression of pure motherly love unmistakable in her eyes. She dragged her into the kitchen, gave her one of her delicious biscuits and sent her on her way with a tender pat on the behind. Still chewing the ends of her biscuit, Noemí found Camilla, who nursed René's famous eggnog. She looked like she was enjoying the conversation she had been having with Noemí's cousin Martha.</p>
		<p>Noemí, with a silencing wink at Camilla, came behind her cousin and wrapped her arms around her, lifting her off her feet and kissing her neck. Her cousin laughed delightedly, having realized that the only one who would greet her like that was Noemí. "Noemí, Noemí!" She called out loudly, happily. She was the wild one in the family, with spiked red hair and a large ring on her nose. She was also a lesbian, and she was in the circle of friends that Noemí and Amelia used to hang with before the accident. The way her cousin had greeted her could only mean that she had come back from that deep depression. When Noemí put her down, she spun around and they hugged tightly. Her eyes resembled Noemí's, only that hers were not as luminous a light blue as Noemí's. Her father had been Thomas' late brother, Theodore.</p>
		<p>"Hi, Mart!" Noemí said onto her shoulder, hugging her tightly. She pulled back and looked Martha's attire over, shaking her head and laughing. She had always been outrageous. Tonight, she wore a deep red velvet dress and black combat boots over very white stockings; her nose ring had a chain that was attached to one of her numerous earrings. "You look wonderful." She said with a laugh.</p>
		<p>Martha posed, her very red lips pursed sexily. Pretty in her outrageous way, Martha attracted enough male and female attention with <i>and</i> without the weird garb. "Why, thank you!" She said, and jumped into Noemí's arms again, kissing her cheek lingeringly.</p>
		<p>Camilla watched with a smile, sipping from her drink. She looked around, thinking. The whole family seemed to be pleasant, they obviously loved each other very much, and she wondered that the whole family didn't say anything or look at Martha strangely, as if her dress were normal. Camilla mused that her family would be whispering behind her back if she dared to dress like that. She caught Terri looking at her with expressionless eyes, and cocked her head to the side, arching her eyebrows cynically in question. Terri looked away and continued to talk with Victoria and Michaela. Camilla forgot about her when Noemí took her into her arms and began to dance with her.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"She loves Noemí." Terri said to Victoria, looking away from Camilla and meeting her eyes.</p>
		<p>Victoria's eyebrows arched. Well, well! "There's nothing wrong with that, Terri." She said softly, giving Michaela a glance; Michaela seemed to be thinking the same thing. She stood with arms crossed and eyebrows arched.</p>
		<p>Terri nodded and then shrugged, sipping from her glass of orange juice slowly. "I know," She said, looking at the dancing couple again; they were dancing, very slowly, as if oblivious to the fast-paced music. Camilla's arms were thrown over Noemí's shoulders, Noemí's arms around her waist holding her close. They talked in hushed tones, whispering close to each other's ears and occasionally kissing. Their bodies seemed to be synchronized, their hips moved against each other very slowly. Terri got an image of them making love, and she couldn't bear it. "I don't want Noemí to love her." She blurted, and then looked away from Victoria and Michaela's surprised eyes, blushing.</p>
		<p>"You don't?" Victoria asked breathlessly, and she reached over to touch Terri's shoulder gently. "Why?" She said softly. She suspected something like this was what Terri had seemed so preoccupied with these past few weeks.</p>
		<p>Terri shook her head, and seemed confused. "I have no idea." She said softly.</p>
		<p>"Do you love her?" Michaela asked gently.</p>
		<p>Terri's gray-brown eyes met hers with thoughtful indecision. "I love her, yes." She whispered and shook her head. "She's done so much for me."</p>
		<p>"No," Michaela said looking into her eyes deeply. "I mean, do you <i>love</i> her?"</p>
		<p>"I don't know." Terri said, comprehending her question. She looked down at their feet, struggling with her feelings.</p>
		<p>Victoria moved closer to her and wrapped an arm around her, looking over at Noemí, whose eyes met hers with question over Camilla's shoulder. She shook her head and winked.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Noemí came up behind Terri, leaning a little over her shoulder and looking at her face. "Are you enjoying yourself?" She asked Terri, smiling down at her.</p>
		<p>Terri returned her smile and avoided her eyes by looking at everyone except her. "Yes." She responded. "Your family, they're great people, specially your cousin Martha. She's fun."</p>
		<p>Noemí wrapped her arm around her shoulders from behind and pulled her close. "I'm glad you like them, they like you too." She said tenderly, placing a kiss on her temple and squeezing her gently.</p>
		<p>Terri laughed to hide her nervousness at her nearness, she reached up and squeezed the arm that embraced her; it was muscled and strong. The body pressed against her back wasn't doing much to help her heart start beating either. "Yes, I noticed," She replied. "Some of them want to cut off Anthony's weenie, others wish it would fall off already, etc, etc."</p>
		<p>Noemí laughed softly close to her ear, never removing her arm from around her. Terri felt as if her nerves were connected to the warm and strong body pressed against her back. "We all love him dearly," Noemí said seriously. "But he's a bastard. What he did to you was really irresponsible, to take advantage of you being alone; most everyone here thinks you are the sweetest thing to touch this planet."</p>
		<p>Terri couldn't stop the flush that stained her cheeks. "Really? You think so too?" She asked meekly.</p>
		<p>Noemí turned her to wrap both arms around her waist, smiling at her and pulling their stomachs together. "Yes, even though I know how bossy you can be." She said in a low voice and chuckled softly, her eyes traveling the soft planes of Terri's face as if really noticing her for the first time. The slender eyebrows arched naturally, her nose was small and straight, her pinkish lips were slender too, and the lower lip pouted softly. She wanted to kiss them. She liked the feel of her flat stomach pressing against the protruding hardness of Terri's. She looked up above them, smiled mischievously and looked down to meet her eyes. "Do you believe in mistletoes?" She asked, and Terri looked up above them also and saw the little green leaves twirling there. She hadn't noticed them the whole night.</p>
		<p>"Are you drunk?" She asked breathlessly, her hands tightening on the muscles of Noemí's arms. Her heart was beating out of control.</p>
		<p>Noemí chuckled softly, and shook her head. "Well, do you?" She asked softly, her eyes moving back and forth from Terri's eyes to her lips.</p>
		<p>Terri could see the nervous pulse of Noemí's throat, could see her jaw working softly. Noemí swallowed hard, her neck muscles bobbing. "And Camilla?" She asked, avoiding the subject, because she could see in Noemí's eyes that if she said yes, she would be kissed like she'd never been kissed before. She wouldn't know how to deal with that.</p>
		<p>Noemí's arms tightened around her gently, and she laughed softly, and a little nervously. "Yes or no?" She asked, her voice husky, her eyes narrowing as she swallowed hard.</p>
		<p>Terri closed her eyes and swayed. "Yes." She whispered, before she could stop herself.</p>
		<p>She heard Noemí whisper softly, brokenly. "Merry Christmas."</p>
		<p>It was like her heart stopped when she felt Noemí's warm lips press against her own for a brief moment, her heart threatened to beat out of control. She staggered back when Noemí pulled her lips away, looking down at her for a long time. A slow smile crossed her lips, and Terri looked around at the people around them. No one seemed to have noticed the kiss. Except for Camilla, who stood on the other side of the room, arms crossed over her chest, an angry look in her eyes. Terri turned away from her and said nothing to Noemí as she walked away, leaving her looking after her with a confused expression.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Terri was in Thomas' study when Noemí finally found her, the lights off, and only the fireplace sending gentle warmth throughout the room. She sat on his chair, head leaning against her hand as she dozed. Noemí crouched beside the chair, gazed at her for a long time. She then touched her thigh softly. It was almost three in the morning, and already, people were leaving with their sleepy children.</p>
		<p>Terri sat up and yawned, Noemí touched her stomach gently. "Lets go home." She said when Terri noticed her.</p>
		<p>Terri nodded, and then paused. "What about Camilla?" She asked hoarsely.</p>
		<p>"She had to go, her family was having a reunion too." Noemí answered with a smile, and stood to help her stand up. "Let's say bye to mom and dad, and then we go. Michaela and Victoria already left, but they send their kisses. They're coming over to the house tomorrow anyway."</p>
		<p>Terri nodded, and allowed her to help her stand. They left the study together.</p>
