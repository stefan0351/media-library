<!-- A Sweet Surrender \ Chapter Ten -->

<p>Andrea woke to find that she was alone in the comforter, the thick sheet had been pulled protectively over her shoulders. She remembered the night before and smiled to herself softly. There was a gloomy light in the cabin house, and she realized they'd slept the whole night. She heard a small sound, but closed her eyes again and drifted off. A loud rasping cough startled her out of her sleep, and she sat up and looked around.</p>
		<p>Cassidy sat huddled below the window, back in her clothes and sneakers, which looked a bit soggy still. Her hair was still humid, and it was loose. She was sitting with her back leaning against the wall, her legs pulled up to her chest and her head buried into the arms cradled around her legs. She was trembling visibly, and violently, staring out at space. Groggily, Andrea stood up, unmindful of her nakedness, and approached her. She kneeled beside her, and touched her shoulder. Cassidy cowered away from her, moaning softly.</p>
		<p>Andrea could see the skin in her arms was flushed, and instinctively knew Cassidy was sick. <i>Cassidy's body is probably aching.</i> She thought to herself. She'd known Cassidy long enough to know that Cassidy was prone to get sick very easily, and that last night's rain was very nasty and cold. "Cassidy," She whispered gently, to not scare her away. She needed to know just how sick Cassidy was. Cassidy didn't respond. "Cassidy." She said, more forcefully.</p>
		<p>Cassidy lifted her head slowly to gaze at her through a feverish haze. Her eyes were glassy and half-closed. She couldn't remember where they were, couldn't really see that clearly. She was only aware of an intense searing ache in her body and a concentration of pain in her lungs. She could hardly breathe, short gasps providing only a bit of the oxygen she needed. There was a wet sound coming from her lungs with each breath she took. Her eyes were rolling behind her lids, and her head was lolling weakly.</p>
		<p>Andrea became instantly alarmed, noticing the extreme paleness and pastiness of Cassidy's face, the redness bright on her cheeks. She was sweating, a line of sweat formed on the area above her upper lip, her lids were drooping. Andrea jumped to her feet and ran towards the kitchen, taking a hold of her clothes and frantically slipping them on as she made her way back towards the living room. She had to take Cassidy to a doctor, Ashleigh preferably, before she got any worse.</p>
		<p>Kneeling beside Cassidy, she whispered: "Cassidy, I have to take you to the doctor." She slipped her arm around Cassidy's shoulder to go beneath her arm. Cassidy cried out and cowered. "Come on, Cassidy," Andrea said soothingly, groaning as she attempted to pull her to her feet. Cassidy was very heavy in her sick state. It took her a few long minutes, but soon, she was helping her out the door and onto the passenger seat of the sports car. She was aware of the wet metallic wheeze in Cassidy's breathing and her worry grew. The rain had stopped, and in place was the gloomy light from the sun beneath the thick clouds. She slipped on the seat-belt and pushed the seat backwards in a reclining position.</p>
		<p>She ran back into the cabin and grabbing the lone key and the comforter, she made her way back out, locking the door behind her and placing the key where they'd found it. She went around the car and jumped into the driver's seat. In an instant, she'd started the car and was making her way out of the little forested road and into the highway.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Ashleigh was woken by the loud sound of her phone ringing beside her. She glanced at the time and frowned, letting her head flop down on her pillow. The truth was she felt like shit, and was extremely tired. She'd spent the whole night out, and then upon arriving home, had spent the rest of the night rolling in bed with a fellow doctor friend. Her companion for the night, a surgeon, had to leave at six in the morning, but not before claiming even more from Ashleigh, leaving her exhausted and not ready for any more. Ashleigh had only been sleeping for an hour and a half before the phone rang. "Let the machine pick up." She grumbled, getting comfortable for sleep again. Andrea's urgent voice coming from the machine made her lift her head and stare at the machine.</p>
		<p><i>"Ashleigh,"</i> Andrea was saying. <i>"Listen, this is Andrea. I need you to pick up this call, please."</i> She paused, breathing quickly in her urgency. <i> "Cassidy is sick and I need you to see her, I'm taking her to the hospital at this minute-"</i></p>
		<p>Ashleigh picked up. "Andrea," She said, fully awake now. "What's wrong with Cassidy?" She demanded, already standing and reaching for her discarded jeans beside the bed.</p>
		<p>Andrea sounded relieved to speak to her. "We got caught out in the rain last night, we weren't able to go home, and got very wet. It was very cold," She said quickly, tears seemed to be coming forth. "I woke up and she was incoherent and feverish. Now she's unconscious. I'm on her car phone."</p>
		<p>Ashleigh was already dressed, and was slipping her bare feet into her loafers. "Okay," She said soothingly. "Take her to my hospital, I should be there in about ten minutes. How long do you think you'll take?" She was on her way to her door, grabbing her keys.</p>
		<p>Andrea seemed to be thinking. "About the same time." She finally said.</p>
		<p>"Okay, see you there." She said breathlessly. "Emergency room." She clicked the phone off and tossed it to the couch, slamming the door behind herself. <i>I didn't even brush my teeth.</i> She thought fleetingly, running her tongue over her teeth testily as she stormed down the stairs towards the garage.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>"Pneumonia." She said to Andrea, pushing her short uncombed hair backwards with a steady hand. She held the stethoscope wound tightly in her other hand, and sat beside Andrea, who was sitting staring at the wall in front of her. It had been over three hours since she'd taken Cassidy into the emergency room. Andrea had arrived a little over two minutes after Ashleigh, whom by the time she got there, had already called with her cellular to make things ready for Cassidy's arrival.</p>
		<p>When they took Cassidy inside, asking Andrea to wait in the Visitors' Area, Cassidy was not responding to anything. Ashleigh had managed to control her fever and placed her under watch and oxygen support. She presently placed a muscular arm around Andrea's shoulders and squeezed gently. "She'll be okay, thank God. She'll be very delicate, of course; but she'll get better quickly, you'll see." She said softly, close to her ear. "You were smart by bringing her in, Andrea. She'll be okay because of you."</p>
		<p>Andrea didn't seem to hear her voice, she closed her eyes and trembled. Steps coming quickly down the hall made her look up. Robie and Gretchen walked side by side, looking at her with looks of alarm. Ashleigh knew they'd dressed in haste, Robie was dressed in sweat clothes. Her hair was loose and fell in an unruly cascade over her shoulders. Gretchen was dressed in wrinkled windbreakers, a cellular in her hand pressed against her ear as she spoke. Ashleigh stood up and greeted them with shakes of their hands, surprised at their appearance. "Andy called me from the payphone," Robie said in explanation, shaking her hand. She glanced at the stoic Andrea and sat next to her, placing her arm over her shoulder and squeezing her. She looked up at Ashleigh, asking: "How is she?"</p>
		<p>"I'll call you with more information, George. Yes. I love you, honey." Gretchen hung up the cellular and looked at Ashleigh questioningly. Her keen eyes did not give up the opportunity to admire the handsome beauty of the older woman's face. She'd slept with Ashleigh once, and it was one of the best sexual experiences she'd ever experienced. But after that experience, due to the fact that both women weren't in love with each other, and Gretchen was still getting over her broken relationship with Cassidy, they decided to keep things civil.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh drew a deep breath, remembering her good times with Gretchen also. "She's better now." She said softly, reassuringly. "We have the inflammation under control, she's breathing better."</p>
		<p>Gretchen nodded briskly, wanting more information. "But is she conscious?" She demanded in her lawyerly way, sitting down on the other side of Andrea, covering her hand and squeezing it gently.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh shook her head, looking down at her feet. "Not yet, she hasn't woken at all." She answered truthfully. "But it's only been a couple of hours."</p>
		<p>Andrea looked up at her with anxious eyes, tears filled them. "Cassidy," She whispered hoarsely.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh kneeled in front of her, and touched her knee softly. "She'll be okay, Andy." She said softly. "You know that she's safe under my care. It didn't get any worse because you thought of bringing her in, because you know how easily she gets sick. The fever is down now, and all we have to worry about is the inflammation of her lungs. With some good antibiotics, it'll be fine in a couple of days."</p>
		<p>Andrea closed her eyes, and nodded. "When can I see her?" She asked softly, grateful for their comfort.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh sighed, thinking. "Give me a couple of more hours," She said tenderly, standing up to her full six foot height. "Maybe I can get her to wake up. You know?"</p>
		<p>Andrea nodded, and laid her head on Robie's shoulder.</p>
		<p>After Ashleigh left them, Gretchen turned towards her and touched her unkempt hair. "What happened?" She asked softly.</p>
		<p>Andrea sighed. "We were outside, enjoying ourselves so much." She said softly. "There were no warnings of rain, so imagine our surprise. We couldn't drive like that," She drew a deep breath. "We spotted a little cabin close by and made our way towards it. We found our way inside," She paused, her eyes widened and her cheeks flushed. "And waited the rain out." She finished the last sentence so quickly and vehemently, that both women knew that she was hiding something, but didn't press. They glanced at each other and raised their eyebrows. Something had happened in the cabin.</p>
		<p>"Okay," Gretchen said softly, stroking her back comfortingly. She stood and pulled Andrea to her feet. Andrea stared at her questioningly. "Come on, you probably haven't eaten a thing, you poor thing. Robie will stay here and we'll go down to the cafeteria."</p>
		<p>"I'm not hungry, Gretchen." Andrea said, not wanting to go far in case Cassidy needed her. She was disheveled and looked very tired. "What if Cassidy needs me?"</p>
		<p>Gretchen smiled at her, and didn't miss the expression in Robie's face over Andrea's shoulder. "Robie is right here, honey. She'll call us if anything." She assured her gently, pulling her down towards the elevators, leaving no room for argument.</p>
		<p>Andrea didn't seem to have the strength left in her to fight any more. She went along with her and allowed Gretchen to choose her breakfast for her. At the table, she nibbled on the food, not really feeling up to eating. "Eat!" Gretchen ordered her firmly, and she began to take small sure bites. After she'd finished, she sat back and breathed softly, memories of the night of lovemaking she'd spent with Cassidy flooding her mind. Gretchen watched the playing emotions and expression on her face. "Tell me what really happened." She said encouragingly.</p>
		<p>Andrea's eyes snapped to hers, wide and scared. "The rain?" She began with a stutter.</p>
		<p>Gretchen cut her off with a small gesture. "Tell me what happened in the cabin." She said.</p>
		<p>Andrea breathed softly, looking down at the very white tabletop, remembering Cassidy's lips on her body and feeling the desire flare up again. "We made love." She said so softly, Gretchen had to strain to hear her.</p>
		<p><i>As I'd suspected.</i> Gretchen thought with an inward smile. "Okay," She said slowly, reaching over and touching her hand softly. "And how do you feel?" She asked, knowing that Andrea needed to talk about it.</p>
		<p>Andrea lifted her eyes to hers and shook her head. "I don't know." She said in a low voice. "It was a feeling that I'd never experienced. My body never felt like that, I'd?" She found she was gasping with the memory of the desire she felt in Cassidy's arms. "Never responded to another person in the way I responded to her." She found it so easy to talk to Gretchen; she didn't know why, but she told her the whole story, beginning when they'd first danced that afternoon. "I felt so comfortable when she touched me, my pores were reaching out to her, and I had no room to talk. She paralyzed me with her mouth and body, I was?" She lost her words, and moved her lips to say more, but found she could not.</p>
		<p>Gretchen smiled tenderly, knowing how well Cassidy could please someone, especially someone she loved as she loved Andrea. She'd begun her relationship with Cassidy with a one night stand, and afterwards couldn't get her out of her mind, couldn't get her body to stop reacting to the memory of the way her fingers had touched her body. So when she'd run into her again by chance, during another college party, she was ecstatic. She brought her mind to the matter at hand, Andrea. "I know you're confused, especially since all this time you thought you were <i>just</i> Cassidy's best friend." She said understandingly.</p>
		<p>"Isn't that what I was? I still am, aren't I?" Andrea asked softly. "I mean, I never thought this would happen between us, I never thought about it." She realized the lie in that instantly, and remained stoically silent.</p>
		<p>Gretchen could see her inner turmoil. "You didn't want it to happen?" She inquired gently.</p>
		<p>Andrea seemed to awaken again. "You don't understand," She said softly. But Gretchen <i>did</i> understand. "I never wanted anything so much in my entire life, I'd-" She was intensely confused. "I don't know." She said after a moment, and remained pensively quiet.</p>
		<p>Gretchen smiled at her, and sat back on her chair. "You wouldn't want it to happen again?" She asked softly.</p>
		<p>Andrea sighed. "I would die of ecstasy again, like I did last night, if it meant for it to happen again." She said softly.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Robie was speaking to Ashleigh, inquiring about the probabilities of Cassidy's health plummeting. Ashleigh explained to her that there was not a chance as long as Ashleigh lived, that she would give Cassidy every medicine she wasn't allergic to if she had to. The truth was that she was worried out of her mind, and sent out for an emergency blood test to see the reason for Cassidy having caught pneumonia so quickly. The tests had come back already, and there was nothing wrong with her blood. She was perfectly fine, except for the pneumonia, of course. There were just some people that got sick quickly and very easily, and Cassidy was one of them. Ever since that first time that she had been hospitalized ten years before, her cells were weak.</p>
		<p>She knew Cassidy tended to catch colds from the smallest drop of rain hitting her head, and was now satisfied to know that it wasn't a deficiency in her immune system, in other words, HIV or AIDS itself. She knew she was perfectly safe, and so was Robie, about whom she'd inquired to Cassidy. "I sent out for emergency HIV and AIDS tests, she came out negative." She explained, shrugging. "So I trust her immune system to kick in with a little help."</p>
		<p>Gretchen walked towards them with Andrea leaning against her, she had a protective arm around the small shoulders. "Anything new?" She asked them.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh shook her head, glancing worriedly at Andrea. She went to her and looked closely at her. Andrea was staring at the floor, looking as if she might fall if Gretchen let her go. Ashleigh lifted her face with a gentle fingertip on her chin. "You okay?" She asked softly.</p>
		<p>Andrea stared up at her, and nodded slowly. "Yes," She said. She seemed about to cry.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh crooned, and pulled her into an embrace. "I told you she's going to be okay." She whispered. "Didn't I?"</p>
		<p>Andrea seemed like a child in need of reassurance. She nodded against her shoulder. She pulled back, and seemed to strengthen as she took a deep breath. "I'd like to see her, whether she's awake or not. I can't take it." She said hoarsely.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Cassidy opened her eyes slowly, and as soon consciousness hit her completely, she felt the uncomfortable sensation of a finger-sized tube in her nostril. She gasped, feeling the tube inside her throat, and twitched, closing her eyes tightly against the light as she felt a smooth hand touch her bare arm softly. Now she remembered hearing a soft voice call to her from far away, or seemingly from far away, wake her slowly and tenderly.</p>
		<p>"Cassidy," She thought she recognized the voice, and forced her eyes open again.</p>
		<p>Andrea stood over with the most concerned look in her expression, her blue eyes teary and tender.</p>
		<p>Cassidy couldn't move her head, the tube was way too uncomfortable for free movement. "An-" She tried to speak, but felt too nauseous.</p>
		<p>Andrea touched her face, and gazed down at her with an expression that was loving. "Cassidy, don't speak, please." She said softly. She smiled softly down at her. "You just collapsed on me, Cassidy. I was very afraid, I had to bring you to the hospital." She paused, and her blue eyes gleamed with tears. "Turns out I did the right thing. You have pneumonia."</p>
		<p>Cassidy closed her eyes against the tenderness in Andrea's eyes, feeling the gentle press of her small hand brushing back her hair. She lifted her unrestrained hand to touch her uncomfortable nose, she felt her nostril was stretched to impossibility. "What-" She gagged again.</p>
		<p>"Shhh," Andrea soothed her. "This thing is going down to one of your lungs, the one most affected." She smiled, embarrassed. "I asked Ashleigh all the questions that you're wondering about now, Cassidy." She paused and kissed her forehead tenderly, her full lips pressing against the warm skin. "I trust her with you."</p>
		<p>Cassidy closed her eyes softly, feeling a deep shiver run through her body despite the sickness. In seconds, she felt total exhaustion claim her slowly. Groggily, she whispered: "Andy?" And lost consciousness, her voice trailing off.</p>
