<!-- Noemí \ Chapter Twenty -->

<p>She walked the  halls back and forth frantically, unaware of the other people around her, her  cushioned feet silent on the floor. The hospital provided her with foam sandals.  She had forgotten all about shoes and coat when the reality of Terri's pain  hit her dead center in her chest.</p>
		<p>Nerves and fear  were making her sweat profusely, her hair matted to her wet forehead; her breathing  quickened and grew shallow. She had just called Victoria, who promised to call  her parents for her.</p>
		<p>The walls of  the Saint John's Hospital's maternity ward waiting area, right outside the operating  rooms, were a bright white decorated with pretty pictures of cartoon babies  riding cars and planes and other assorted items. Noemí didn't notice  their beauty as she paced all over the waiting area.</p>
		<p>Travis had left  her there after having a crew retrieve the by then screaming Terri from Noemí's  arms. He had assured her he would be back as soon as he got her settled. Noemí's  palms were sweaty and she couldn't shake the thought that she could loose Terri.
			<i>Not like Amelia, please, God, don't take her away like Amelia!</i> Noemí  thought frantically, images of Amelia's lifeless eyes staring at her in the  near darkness of her car flashing behind her eyes. "Oh, God!" Anxiety took a  hold of her heart, and squeezed tight; she felt as if a black blanket had suddenly  covered her eyes and her legs go from underneath her.
		</p>
		<p>Someone touched  her arm, and she pulled away, bracing her back against the wall, crossing her  arms over her chest protectively. Her eyes were unfocused, and dizziness threatened  to take her consciousness away again. "Noemí," the voice whispered close  to her ear with such tender care, that she tried to focus her eyes again. "Come  on, girl, take a slow breath! Relax, you're hyperventilating, relax. It's just  an anxiety attack." She felt gentle hands grabbing her by the shoulders and  shaking her softly, and she closed her eyes, following the gentle voice's instruction.</p>
		<p>She opened her  eyes, able to breathe better now, and she could now see Travis looking down  at her with a kind expression. He helped her back up, and she saw that the other  people in the room were looking at her with a mix of concern and relief. She  grasped his arms, and shook him. "How is she? Tell me!" She demanded, noticing  the nurse standing just behind him. "Oh God, Travis, please," She cried out,  her legs weakening again. "Please, tell me she's not dead! I can't
			<i>loose</i>  her, Travis, don't do this to me!" She began to sob, and barely heard him  telling her to get a grip on herself, or he wouldn't tell her anything. "Tell  me!"
		</p>
		<p>"It's going to  be a difficult birth, the baby is coming legs first. Breach." He explained to  her softly as he helped her back to her feet. "I will have to perform a Caesarian  on her-"</p>
		<p>Noemí  clutched his arms with frantic hands. "I can't loose her, Travis. Help her,
			<i>save</i> her. Please!" She begged him, tears in her eyes.
		</p>
		<p>He wrapped his  arms around her. "It is much easier than regular birth, Noemí." He said  soothingly, and gestured to the nurse, who moved forward. "Give her a tranquilizer,  Nicole-"</p>
		<p>"No!" Noemí  protested, and moved away from him. "I want to be aware of when the baby is  born." Her knees wobbled and she found a seat, looking up at him, trying to  appear calm. "Please."</p>
		<p>Travis looked  down at her for a long time, and nodding, turned away, signaling the nurse to  follow him. Noemí sighed with relief, and remained sitting, hands clasped  together tightly, waiting for her parents to arrive. Her mind kept mercilessly  flashing memories of that accident that had taken away so much from her, and  she kept trying to dodge them, trying to remain in reality. By the time Victoria  arrived with Natalie and Thomas, her breathing had grown shallow again, her  eyes wide. Her mother took her in her arms, and she cried again. "I can't loose  her, mom, I
			<i>can't</i>!" She sobbed, and clutched her mother in an embrace  full of fear. "It can't happen again!"
		</p>
		<p>Thomas sat at  her other side, and wrapped his arms around both her and Natalie; Victoria knelt  in front of her and kneaded her leg gently. "Try to calm down and tell us what  is going on." She said softly, and Noemí told them what Travis told her,  taking longer in her nervousness. "Okay, just relax. Times have changed, women  don't usually die from Caesarians, okay?" Victoria comforted her.</p>
		<p>Thomas and Natalie  muttered their agreement.</p>
		<p>It didn't appease  Noemí. "Her mother died like that when Terri was born, she couldn't give  birth to her the regular way, and she died before they could do anything to  save her, she was so small like Terri!" She gasped with tears. "They even lost  a few that way, in her family? Oh my God, what if she
			<i>dies</i>, Vicki?  What if she
			<i>dies</i>, what will I do? I love her Vicki, I never told her  because I never knew. Now I know I love her!" She sobbed into her mother's shoulder,  clutching her tightly, and Victoria tried to appease her with gentle words;  it was all to no avail.
		</p>
		<p>Natalie's eyes  watered with sympathy.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Travis emerged  almost four hours later, already scrubbed clean. There was a smile on his handsome  face, and he went directly to Noemí, who sat rocking silently in a chair  between her parents. Victoria leaned against a wall to one side, talking quietly  with Michaela. Kneeling in front of Noemí, Travis took her hand, squeezing  softly. "Want to see her?" He asked gently when Noemí's eyes focused  on him.</p>
		<p>She stood shakily,  not saying a word, and allowed him to lead her away from her friends and parents.</p>
		<p>Terri looked  so small underneath the hospital covers; the IV connected to her left arm dripped  slowly, the thin oxygen tubes inserted into her nostrils made her look so sick.  Seeing the frightened look in Noemí's eyes as she stopped dead a few  feet away from Terri, he explained gently: "She was in surgery, honey. The IV  and the oxygen mean nothing, she'll be okay." Travis left her quietly.</p>
		<p>Noemí  walked cautiously up to the bed, looking at her, taking in the difference in  her stomach, much flatter now, almost non-existent. She took her small hand  cautiously, which lay limply over her stomach, and caressed the back gently  with her thumb. Terri moaned softly with pain, and her eyes flickered open,  her head lolled to one side as she looked around. Then her beautiful eyes focused  on Noemí, and a slow smile curved her lips. "Hi." She whispered sleepily,  meeting Noemí's eyes; Noemí couldn't help the fear that still  gripped her heart.</p>
		<p>"Hi." Her voice  was hoarse; it shook, full of fear. She touched her hair, which felt full and  looked shiny around her head. Terri's skin looked a little pale, but she seemed  healthier.</p>
		<p>"Were you crying,  Noemí?" Terri asked gently, and lifted her hand from Noemí's to  touch her noble cheek tenderly. "Don't cry, I'm fine, I mean it. You don't  need to be afraid."</p>
		<p>Reassured by  her words, Noemí knelt beside the bed and buried her face into Terri's  neck, inhaling deeply. "I didn't want to loose you, Terri. I love you." She  whispered softly.</p>
		<p>Terri's eyes  were full of tears when Noemí met her eyes. "That's a good thing to know,"  She whispered, confused by the strong emotion those three words made her feel.  "I'm confused, Noemí. You've done something to me?" She said softly.</p>
		<p>Noemí  nodded and touched her lips to Terri's forehead, then kissed her way softly  down to her cheeks. "What about the baby?" She asked against her skin.</p>
		<p>"Bigger than  life and beautiful." Terri said softly, touching her hand to Noemí's  face again. "A girl and she has your mother's eyes, I think; I hope they stay  like that. But even better would be if she had
			<i>your</i> eyes." She paused  and met Noemí's eyes with a soft smile. "Her name is Noemí Imogene;  my mother's name was Imogene. But I want her to be called Noemí  too, like you."
		</p>
		<p>Noemí's  eyes filled with tears again. Finally, she managed: "Oh, Terri!" And cried into  her shoulder, her shoulders shaking with soft sobs. She felt Terri's gentle  hand on the back of her head, holding her close and comforting her. "I was so  afraid it would happen again, that somebody I love would die. I'm still so afraid."</p>
		<p>Terri clutched  Noemí's hair softly, and pulled her face back to meet her eyes. "Stop  it, Noemí. I'm right here, okay?" She said softly, and pulled her head  down again. After a long time, Noemí pressing her face against her shoulder,  her arm thrown carefully over her upper stomach, Terri asked gently: "Have you  seen her?"</p>
		<p>Noemí  pulled back to look at her and shook her head. "I had to see you first." She  responded. "You saw her, you said?"</p>
		<p>Terri's eyes  twinkled with the love of a new mother. "Yes, only for a few seconds, I wasn't  in the best condition." She whispered. "But when I saw her she was purplish  and crying herself red!" She laughed softly, and broke off into a groan of pain.  Noemí held her hand until she relaxed, and kissed her forehead again.  "Go see the baby, honey." Terri said very softly, and Noemí felt comforted  by her sweet tone. "Go see her, and come back and tell me."</p>
		<p>Noemí  left the room, and went to the nurses' station. "Excuse me, where can I view  the babies?" She asked, and the nurse, with barely a glance at her, directed  her down a long hall. Noemí walked down, until she could see to the right  side, the windows to the maternity room. There were beautiful babies, many crying  healthily and flushing, all together in six rows of cradles and four down from  the front. Noemí searched with her eyes, and found little Noemí  almost at the front, under Bledsoe-Leone. Surprised by the combination of both  names, she soon forgot about it as her sight fell on the most beautiful creation  in the universe.</p>
		<p>There, all eighteen  inches of little pink flesh, staring up at the ceiling with beautiful green-blue  eyes and sucking healthily at a pacifier, lay little Noemí, wrapped up  in a pink bundle. Her baby cheeks flushed pink, her almost non-existent eyebrows  were shaped like almost all members of the Leone family have, the imperfection  of the arched left eyebrow leaving no doubt. Her surprisingly thick hair was  an auburn shade, sticking up adorably from the top of her head; a little part  on the right side of her head, sending most of it sideways. A tender smile crossed  Noemí's face as she fell in love all over again with Terri's daughter,  little Noemí, her young namesake; she had been in love with the child  since she'd first pressed her face against Terri's stomach. There was no doubt  in Noemí's mind that she was
			<a name="thirdediting"></a> a Leone, though  for a long time there hadn't been any.
		</p>
		<p>She spun around  as she heard her name being called softly. It was Victoria, standing a few feet  away with Michaela and her parents. She beckoned them forward, and as they flanked  around her, she pointed little Noemí out. "Her name is Noemí,  Terri named her after me." She said softly, her voice full of emotion and pride.  "Isn't she perfect?"</p>
		<p>Thomas and Natalie  were crying softly, gazing at the beautiful child and holding each other. Victoria  and Michaela were murmuring softly, awe in their voices.</p>
		<p>Natalie gasped  softly, pointing at her with thin manicured fingers. "Oh, look, Thomas, she  has your eyebrows! Her eyes, they're so much like mine." She was saying in wonder.  "But that can change, Noemí's eyes were like mine when
			<i>she</i> was  born. And," Her voice took on a teasing tone. "I don't know, but your blood  takes more precedence in our children than mine. Look how they are so much like  you and resemble you so much."
		</p>
		<p>Thomas chuckled  softly, and he held Natalie tighter to him. "We have a granddaughter, Natalie."  He whispered in wonderment, gazing at the child once more. "We're grandparents,  now, and I feel wonderful."</p>
		<p>Noemí's  eyes were glued to that child, and a soft smile touched her face as she gazed  at her, palms flat against the glass. "She's perfect." She said softly, and  tears filled her eyes. She felt Victoria's arms wrap around her and pulled her  close tenderly, and she turned and buried her head against her shoulder. "She's  so beautiful." She lifted her head and looked at the baby again. "Let's go see  Terri." She said softly and walked away, an arm around Victoria's shoulders.</p>
		<p>Terri's eyes  were open, and she smiled as they all shuffled quietly into the room. She reached  for Noemí's hand, and was gratified to feel her long fingers slip into  her grasp. She smiled at the others, and looked back at Noemí. "Did you  see her?" She asked softly.</p>
		<p>Noemí  nodded, and looked into her eyes. "She is amazingly perfect, and so beautiful."  She whispered, and kissed Terri's hand gently. "Like her mother."</p>
		<p>Terri smiled  at her, and found that she couldn't look away from Noemí's eyes. "Tell  me about her eyes." She said.</p>
		<p>"They
			<i>are</i>  like mom's, green, but mom thinks they'll change and become like mine. Because  I was born that way, with my eyes almost like hers, but they changed." Noemí  said softly against the back of her hand, her eyes closing in concentration  at the feel of Terri's hand.
		</p>
		<p>"Her hair," Terri  said softly, wrinkling her nose softly. "I couldn't tell her hair color, she  was so dirty."</p>
		<p>"Her hair has  an auburn color and it sticks upwards, and it looks so soft." Noemí's  eyes twinkled with tenderness. "I love her."</p>
		<p>Terri's eyes  met hers, and she pulled Noemí's hand to kiss it softly. "I'm glad, because  she'll love you too."</p>
