<!-- A Sweet Surrender \ Chapter Three -->

<p>"Ms. Cates, I don't see why we have to write this essay on Adolph Hitler." Roseanne Mitchell was saying in her lovely voice two Mondays later; she was one of Andrea's all time favorite students. Her bright red hair bobbed up and down as she spoke. "Mrs. Morello could have given us someone better, like... Franklin D. Roosevelt!" Her blue eyes lit up. "There's one guy who deserves a little praise." She continued before Andrea got a word of response in; she opened her mouth again to reply. But Roseanne rambled on: "I mean, to be sick enough to be crippled and still have the strength to run a country, much less a war..."</p>
		<p>Roseanne was a lively Irish-American fifteen-year-old descendant whose thin mouth ran more than her feet. She was short and thick, more like bubbly, and plain and simply adorable. Andrea, in her five years of teaching, had never met a student who had as many friends as Roseanne did. She was a great student, and got excellent grades, which also made her a favorite among teachers.</p>
		<p>"Why don't you speak to her about it?" Andrea asked her when she finally quieted down. They were sitting in the small office Andrea shared with another English teacher. Every day, on Roseanne's free period, which would also be one of Andrea's, they would sit in the smallish office and have interesting conversations.</p>
		<p>A sound like a squeal came out of Roseanne's mouth. Her eyes widened so much that her blue irises were completely visible. "Are you crazy?" She exclaimed, her voice raised an octave. "I'm complaining, yeah. But that's just between you and me, Ms. Cates." Her facial expression changed to that of secrecy. "You know I'll do the stupid essay anyway."</p>
		<p>Andrea laughed; Roseanne made her laugh too much. "Oh, Roseanne. No wonder every body loves you." She said breathlessly between her laughter. "You're adorable."</p>
		<p>Roseanne brightened even more. "I must remind you of yourself, then." She replied, her cheeks flushing. "Everybody loves you too. When you're not around, the students just go on and on about you. All the boys are in love with you," He hesitant. "Even the gay boys and girls."</p>
		<p>Andrea laughed again; her stomach was beginning to hurt. "How's your mother, Roseanne?" She asked, changing the subject.</p>
		<p>"She's fine." Roseanne answered, smiling. Andrea had met Carey Mitchell at a parent-teacher conference and the two women had taken to each other. Carey was a short butch who was definitely not in the closet. She'd gotten pregnant with Roseanne when she spent the night with a gay man, who was her best friend. For as long as they'd known each other, Carey and Roseanne's father wanted to have a child together. And they did, raising the child with love and an open-mindedness that paid them well. But really, the biggest reason for Andrea's fondness for Carey was that she reminded her of Cassidy, with her aggressive demeanor and courteous attitude. "She says hello."</p>
		<p>"Same from me." Andrea said, glancing at her watch. "Tell her I'll call her about dinner soon. Now, the bell's about to ring. You better get ready." She advised. She watched Roseanne pick up her things from the small student desk by the corner and shove them into her backpack. "See you in class."</p>
		<p>Roseanne walked to the door, turned around and said: "See you in class." Then walked out and closed the door behind herself.</p>
		<p>Andrea sat back on her chair and sighed dreamily, her thoughts straying to Cassidy, as they seemed to be going more and more. She wondered what she was doing at that exact moment.</p>
		<p>Cassidy leaned forward in her seat, switched on her computer, and waited for its program to load. She watched solemnly as the usual information scrolled through the dark screen. She stood up and went to her kitchen, -rolling her wide muscular shoulders- a large and stylish piece of work. The cabinets were made of oak, shiny and spacious. The refrigerator was a large Westinghouse double door, which produced ice and water out of a built in hole on the freezer door. The oven, along with the microwave, was also Westinghouse, and was custom-built into the wall and ran off electricity.</p>
		<p>Cassidy opened the refrigerator and peered inside, looking for something to snack on. She worked out of her office at home from time to time, not finding it really necessary to be at the main building every day. Still, she had an office waiting for her. Her computer at home was linked to the ones at work, and whenever she needed information to work for an article all she had to do was call and link with the computer through the telephone lines with a code.</p>
		<p>Her editor, Joel Michaels, the chief editor of New Carter News, was a short plump man in his thirties with penetrating brown eyes and blonde hair. He was generally nice, but could be a pain in the ass when it suited him. Cassidy was awaiting email from him, feedback on the latest article she'd written. She'd left her assignment on human rights on his desk the previous Friday, along with a note letting him know she'd remain home that Monday, to email her with his comments. When he presented her with that assignment, she'd been glad. She'd gotten in touch with old flames or friends who were known activists in the gay, lesbian, black, and other organizations. Some were leaders, while others just helped or supported.</p>
		<p>What she basically did was go around visiting some of them at these organizations, asking for numbers on statistics and opinions on today's youth on the rising of the AIDS epidemic, and the American government's almost non-existent help. After she received what she needed, she began to write her first draft, reviewed it, and finished her second draft easily. That was the one she'd sent Joel.</p>
		<p>Finally, she found something to her liking. A frozen yogurt. She sat down on her black plush-leather couch. She sighed, feeling it mold to her body, holding the teaspoon and cup on each hand. She ate the yogurt slowly, her mind fading, conjuring thoughts of Andy. Cassidy missed her already. She'd last seen her three days before, on Friday night, with Jeffrey at her shoulder, keeping eye on her every movement. She wondered when there would be a time when he wouldn't be present, building a wall between them.</p>
		<p>Cassidy couldn't help but dislike him; she never disliked any of Andrea's previous boyfriends; as much as they knew the deep nature of her love for Andrea, they never tried to separate them. Andrea would never have allowed it. But Jeffrey, Cassidy grimaced at the thought of him, Jeffrey hated her with an unnatural passion. He was trying to do everything possible to separate them, and Cassidy knew it. She knew she wasn't fighting, but then again, she was never one to fight. If she would have been a fighter, if she had fought against Jeffrey for herself, she knew Andy would have at least been aware of her feelings. If she had been a fighter, she knew she wouldn't have tried to commit suicide that long ago day when her family turned their backs on her.</p>
		<p>She still had the marks on her wrists to prove it, and still, at times, she felt like reopening those wounds. Cassidy remembered it as if it were yesterday. She was fifteen then, and had gone to her mother, sat down in front of her between her and the TV. Mrs. Martica Monsignor had been, and still probably still was, Cassidy didn't know, a television addict. Nothing, except her husband and the kitchen, could get her off the couch and her knitting. So when a young Cassidy sat in front of her, trying to get her attention, Mrs. Monsignor ignored her, looking over her shoulder at the old General Electric television. "Mom," Cassidy had said softly, shyly, struggling against her resolve. "I need to talk to you."</p>
		<p>Mrs. Monsignor stared at her daughter as if she were a pest. "What?" She demanded in cold exasperation. "What is it?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy cringed at the cold tone of her mother's voice. "Mom," She was always an intelligent speaker. "You have to be objective. You have to listen to me, don't shut me out, please."</p>
		<p>Mrs. Monsignor stared at her daughter, whom she didn't feel deep in her heart, with annoyance. "Will you say it already," She exclaimed, her accent thick. "I'm missing the Ed Sullivan show!"</p>
		<p>Cassidy had taken a deep breath and blurted it all out. About her feelings for other females, of her desires. Of everything that was in her heart, with just a little hope that her mother would understand and love her anyway.</p>
		<p>Her mother stared at her blankly, and then, with a horrifying look of disgust, unleashed a hard slap to young Cassidy's face. Cassidy fell off the coffee table, feeling the stinging spot where her mother's ragged hand had landed. "Don't talk that crap in my house!" Mrs. Monsignor had shrieked, stomping over to where her daughter lay shocked. Her kick to the stomach sent the air from the vulnerable Cassidy. "You're not my daughter," She hissed vehemently. "And wait until Carlos comes home."</p>
		<p>Cassidy ran to her room, where she lay in a state of hysteria, trembling violently. She knew her father wouldn't be so nice. About two hours later, the sound of her father's steps through the house, her mother's low and angry voice, and then the heavy sound of his angry steps coming up the stairs, sent her into a sobbing fit. The severe beating she received still didn't absolve her from going to school the next day.</p>
		<p>Bruised and aching, her heart completely numb, a sharp blade inside her pocket, she left the house the next morning to school. Andy had been waiting for her outside the school at their usual spot. And when Cassidy didn't stop to greet her and talk to her, but sped by instead, she knew something was terribly wrong. She called out her name, then merely followed when Cassidy didn't answer her. Cassidy went into an empty bathroom and when Andrea walked in a few seconds later, she found her standing and staring expressionless at a quickly growing pool of blood at her feet.</p>
		<p>Her wrists were cut open, she was paling very quickly, and her legs wavered. There seemed to be so much blood. Andrea had screamed for help and ran to her best friend's side. When Cassidy crumpled in her arms, getting blood all over her, her face unnaturally pale, her eyes crossing before they fluttered closed, she knew Cassidy was the most important thing in her life. She never ceased letting Cassidy know that.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's heart skipped a beat at the thought of being in Andrea's arms. She closed her eyes, feeling in her body a rush of intense heat. She would make passionate love to her, make her know with her body what she couldn't describe with words. The jarring sound of the phone startled her out of her thoughts. She picked up on the second ring. "Hello?" She said hoarsely.</p>
		<p>"Cassidy," It was Andy, her soft voice sending a chill through Cassidy's spine. And then needlessly, she said: "It's Andy."</p>
		<p>Cassidy would recognize that beautiful voice anywhere; she closed her eyes to the sound of the velvet voice on the other side of the line. "Hi, Andy." She whispered hoarsely. "I recognized your voice."</p>
		<p>"Are you okay, Cassidy?" Andy asked, worry in her voice. "Are you getting a cold?"</p>
		<p><i>God, she's so innocent!</i> Cassidy thought with a deep swelling of her heart. <i>How could I ever corrupt her like that?</i> "I'm fine, Andy." She said after clearing her throat. "I was resting a little, that's all. How are you?"</p>
		<p>Andy smiled. "I'm okay, Cassidy." She paused, hesitating. "I missed you."</p>
		<p>Cassidy's heart quickened, and she berated herself: You're<i> her best friend, of course she misses you!</i>' She shook her head. <i>Stop this, Dammit! She's innocent!</i> "I've missed you too, Andy." She said in a low voice.</p>
		<p>Andy closed her eyes, feeling her throat constrict. "Have dinner with me, Cassidy." She said impulsively. "It's been a long time. Just you and me." She continued, placating.</p>
		<p>"What about Jeffrey?" Cassidy asked, despite herself.</p>
		<p>"He'll be at a dinner meeting, Cassidy." Andrea replied firmly, letting her know with her tone of voice that it didn't matter whether he was in a meeting or not. She wanted to have dinner with her, and that was it. She said: "And even if he weren't, I'd still go to dinner with you." She paused. "So, will you have dinner with me?" She asked again.</p>
		<p>Cassidy couldn't say no, she wanted so much to look into her Andy's sky blue eyes and feel as if she were staring at the sky itself. She wanted to feel her love, even if it wasn't the same woman-to-woman love she felt for her. "Okay," She said softly. "Where do you want to meet?"</p>
		<p>Andy let out a long held breath, she was so sure Cassidy would decline. "Great!" She exclaimed. "Come and pick me up. We'll go to a nice, comfortable place. No need to dress up."</p>
		<p>"Okay, at eight?" Cassidy asked, feeling nice. Very nice.</p>
		<p>"Eight it is." Andy said lightly, then: "I love you." And hung up.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled to herself, feeling her heart was about to beat out of her chest. She took a deep breath, and realized the yogurt lay forgotten on the white coffee table in front of her. She shook her head; she wasn't hungry any more. She stood up, deciding to make a visit to a dear old friend.</p>
