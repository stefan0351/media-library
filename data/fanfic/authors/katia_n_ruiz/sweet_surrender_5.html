<!-- A Sweet Surrender \ Chapter Four -->

<p>Ashleigh Simmons was a very active member in the war against AIDS. A medical doctor and blood specialist for twenty plus years, she had become especially interested in the cause when her younger brother died of the horrid disease. An austere, though highly attractive woman in her forties, she held ground in her field of work. Her short graying hair and flashing green eyes gave her an air of sophistication that preceded her wherever she showed her presence. Articulate in speech, she was highly educated and her social status remained unperturbed despite the openness of her sexuality. Very tall and built, she was healthy in every extent. She was in great shape for her forty-seven years of age. She exercised regularly, sometimes with Cassidy, most of the time alone.</p>
		<p>This afternoon, for instance, she received Cassidy's call and immediately made plans to meet at the gym.</p>
		<p>Bailey's Gym, located uptown on McGuire Boulevard owned the whole building from which it operated. Large beige stucco, one hundred years old, it held six floors reserved strictly to all exercise and therapeutic equipment. Its other seven floors were used for offices for employees and physiotherapists that decided to operate from there.</p>
		<p>Presently, Ashleigh was walking on the treadmill, on the Hill Level. She'd been at it for a little over thirty minutes and the sweat was running in rivulets down her sculpted body. Cassidy was running on her own treadmill, her leg muscles shifting visibly and attractively. It was all Ashleigh could do to not loose her footing and fall off the mill. She and Cassidy had slept together a good amount of times, but were also well acquainted as friends. Not that sex between them was bad; indeed, it was mind-blowing. "For a much younger woman,"- twenty years younger, in fact,- She once breathlessly told Cassidy, "You sure know how to use your hands." They cared about each other, very much, and never gave up the opportunity to do things together.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh had met Cassidy when she was in her tenth year as a doctor. Cassidy had been seventeen, and had been brought in dying from self-inflicted severely deep slices to both her wrists. Ashley definitely saved her, a crash operation that brought the veins back together and the precariously open skin closed, all performed in the Emergency Room. Cassidy remained unconscious for three and a half days, no visits from her parents, and Ashleigh could remember leaning against the bed and staring at the beautiful young woman she was. And that hadn't changed, Cassidy was as gorgeous as ever. Ashleigh had to wonder what brought Cassidy to that extreme. She remembered Andrea and how she saw the reason Cassidy fell so helplessly in love with her.</p>
		<p>Andrea nurtured Cassidy back to life, back to health. She never missed a day without seeing her. She would run over right after school and remain there until her father would pick her up at the end of the visiting hours. Andrea had a beautiful smile and gorgeous loving eyes that would make anyone's head lighten. "Ash," Cassidy said, a little out of breath. She flicked her wetly bouncing hair from her forehead in an impatient gesture. Ashleigh found the gesture adorable. "What are you thinking of?"</p>
		<p>Ashleigh smiled at her, wiping the sweat off her forehead with her towel. "Of Andrea, when she went to see you at the hospital, when you and I first met." She replied in her throaty voice. "You were so obviously in love then."</p>
		<p>Cassidy's eyes widened. "Have I always been that obvious?" She asked, awed.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh punched the buttons that would stop the machine. It slowed to a stop. Cassidy did the same, and stood with taut legs wide, taking deep breaths and wringing her wide shoulders. Ashleigh touched her shoulder with her large doctor's hand and Cassidy stopped her movements. "You always were, Cas." She said softly, squeezing her shoulder. "I'm still trying to figure out how Andrea doesn't know." The touch of her hand was so comforting. Cassidy felt like crying.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh crooned, seeing her gathering tears and pulling her into an embrace.</p>
		<p>"I love her so much!" Cassidy gasped, feeling the tears stinging her eyes. Her body shook with her suppressed tears, but she suddenly pulled back, meeting Ashleigh's eyes with her own. "I'm hurting, Ash!" She said raggedly, and turned away, wiping at her tears. Her cheeks and nose were flushed; her sensuous mouth was now a thin line of despair.</p>
		<p>Ashleigh watched her, compassion and deep caring squeezing her heart. "You don't talk about this," She said softly, touching her chest with her finger. "Why don't you come to my place after dinner?" She suggested, deciding right there and then that she'd make love to her then, to give Cassidy her care. They hadn't for almost a year, and it was about time.</p>
		<p>Cassidy nodded, knowing what would happen. She wanted it, and who better with than Ashleigh. "I'll see you tonight, then." She said, sniffing. She looked at the large face of her designer watch. SIX THIRTY FIVE. "I have to go, Ash. But I'll call you on my way over."</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>She let the phone ring three times before picking it up. She reached over to her bedside table. "Hello?" She said breathlessly, sitting back down on the bed and bending over to continue to pull her tight white socks.</p>
		<p>"It is Carey. How are you?" The friendly voice with the thick Irish accent on the other line said.</p>
		<p>Andrea smiled at the sound of her friend's voice. "Hi!" She greeted. "I'm glad to hear from you." She continued sincerely.</p>
		<p>Carey laughed. "So am I." She noticed Andrea's uneasy breathing. "What in the world are you doing?"</p>
		<p>Andrea laughed. "Sicko," She teased. "Pulling on my socks, I'm having dinner with Cassidy tonight."</p>
		<p>Carey smiled. "So what's the miracle?" She asked, surprised.</p>
		<p>Andrea shrugged, chuckling gently. "I don't know, but I'm taking advantage." She said softly, not really knowing what to say about Cassidy's disappearing acts, except that she constantly missed her and thought of her. In times of distress over Cassidy's disappearances, Andrea had always called Carey for consolation and advice. She hurt so much when Cassidy avoided her, in a way that left her feeling so empty inside.</p>
		<p>"How was Valentine's dinner with her?" Carey asked.</p>
		<p>Andrea sighed, remembering the evening as if it were yesterday, specially dancing with Cassidy. "It was great... and I cried. I didn't know I missed her so much." She said slowly. "It felt so good to hold her close like that, you know? We danced a lot."</p>
		<p><i>Well, what do you know? Could Andy be in love with Cassidy and not even know it?</i> She mused, her eyebrows arching; she nodded slowly to herself in answer. "You and Cassidy?"</p>
		<p>Andrea smiled softly. "Yes," She said dreamily. "She's a great dancer, better than any of my boyfriends. And Jeffrey doesn't dance, really. Nevertheless, I never really liked to dance with any of them, not since Cassidy first danced with me." She knew she must have been rambling, but when it came to Cassidy, she always rambled.</p>
		<p>"What time are you leaving?" Carey asked.</p>
		<p>Andrea glanced at her watch. SEVEN FORTY FIVE, the face said. "In about fifteen minutes." She replied, leaning back on the bed when she finished.</p>
		<p>"Okay, then." Carey said. "Call me tomorrow. Maybe we can have some dinner."</p>
		<p>"Okay, say hello to Roseanne for me, will you?" Andrea said, smiling.</p>
		<p>"Will do." Carey said, smiling. "Bye."</p>
		<p>Both women hung up. Not five minutes passed before the loud sound of a horn pierced the air. Andrea shook her head at the sound, laughing, and picking up her jean jacket from the coat rack. She walked out of the apartment, turning off all the lights.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Cassidy's breath caught in her throat at the sight of casually clad Andrea as she came down the steps of her brownstone house. She wore black cargo shorts and a white short-sleeve T-shirt. Her yellow construction boots were new and not scuffed yet; her white socks were rolled down to her ankles. Her hair was loose and windswept. She looked adorably young and preppy. She watched her jump into the passenger seat of her red Mustang Convertible. "Hi," Andrea said, throwing her arms over Cassidy's shoulders and pulling her close to kiss her cheek.</p>
		<p>The sweet scent of her perfume, Cassidy recognized it as Versace, sent a shiver through her. "Hi," She said shyly, taken aback by the hot-cold shiver running through her body. She shifted gears and pulled into traffic. "Where are we going?" She asked after a few minutes of silence, in which she remembered the memorized feeling of Andrea's breast pressing against her arm.</p>
		<p>Andrea grinned, turning over in her seat to stare at Cassidy. "Benny's." She said softly, allowing her eyes to take in Cassidy's soft beauty. Every time she stared at her, she seemed to newly realize a little more of how beautiful Cassidy's whole body was. Tonight she realized how beautiful her profile was. Her forehead high, but softly feminine, it softly blended with the perfectly straight nose; her lips were smooth and full, her thick lower lip pouted sensuously. Her eyebrows were thin and black, and her lashes long and naturally curly. Her jaw was strong and chiseled. Her skin was so smooth looking that Andrea couldn't help but reach out and touch her skin. "You're beautiful, Cassidy." She whispered, feeling her heart swell.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's heartbeat quickened as she felt the strong intensity of Andrea's gaze upon her. She didn't trust herself to answer. She pressed the play button on her car radio, and the soft music of Tara MacLean, a new pop singer, blared out of her speakers. The song, titled 'That's me,' rang a bell inside Cassidy, and she listened quietly, like always. Andrea sat back, and listened too.</p>
		<p>Benny's was a brand new restaurant built two years ago. Its interiors were decorated tastefully to make its patrons feel comfortable, and to allow them to dress as they wished. The chairs and tables were made of a comfortable and stylish silvery metal; they gave it the quality of modernity. Inside, Andrea took out the time to see what Cassidy was wearing, and approved. She wore snug Kakhi shorts, a black T-shirt and white sneakers. Andrea noticed the tautness of the muscles on her legs and thighs, and asked: "You've been going to the gym?" She sat down on the chair Cassidy pulled out for her.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled. "Yes, I have. Today was the last time, actually." She answered, settling down across from her. "I went with Ashleigh."</p>
		<p>Andrea smiled at Cassidy. "You've seen Ashleigh?" She asked. "How is she?" She knew of Cassidy's various encounters with Ashleigh, and found it slightly amusing that a woman her age could still do such passionate and energetic romps with someone as young as Cassidy was, compared to her. <i>But then again,</i> Andrea thought. <i>Ashleigh Simmons is in great shape.</i> She knew that at one point, when Cassidy had been twenty-one, she'd ended up sleeping with Ashleigh, and that their already strong friendship was made even stronger by that fact.</p>
		<p>"She's doing great. I'm seeing her again later on tonight." Cassidy said, smiling back at Andrea. "She sends her greetings."</p>
		<p>"Tell her I said hello too." Andrea said, a knowing smile on her lips. They paused as their waiter asked for their orders. After he left them, Andrea whispered, reaching over and touching Cassidy's hand with the tips of her fingers: "I've really missed you, Cassidy." Her eyes searched for Cassidy's, which were locked to their touching hands. She couldn't seem to stop telling her that she missed her.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's throat constricted, she couldn't speak. She looked up at Andrea, trying not to let her emotions show through them. She lost herself in the blue of Andrea's gaze, her heart beating quickly out of control. "Andy," She said hoarsely, knowing she wasn't making a good show at hiding how deep her feelings for Andrea really were. Now it depended on Andrea to see or not. She pulled her hand away; the spot Andrea touched felt as if it were burning.</p>
		<p>Andrea didn't see the emotions playing across Cassidy's eyes; she just didn't know how to read it in her gaze. A thought occurred to her. "Let's have a picnic, this weekend or the next." She said impulsively, wanting to spend more time with her. "Jeffrey is going to be away on business matters. Just you and me, at Fountain Woods?" She pleaded with her eyes. Fountain Woods had been the place where they would go together in their youth so that Cassidy would get away from the misery at home, and where they could be together alone. The thought brought back wonderful memories to both women. "Where we used to go all the time, remember? To be together," She whispered, never taking her eyes off Cassidy's.</p>
		<p>Cassidy couldn't stand to look into her eyes; she looked down at the table. Andrea took her hands into hers. "What's wrong, Cassidy?" She demanded softly. "I'm your <i>best friend</i>, you need to talk to me." Her eyes watered.</p>
		<p>Cassidy closed her eyes tightly against the lightheaded feeling of the love she held for Andrea in her heart. Impulsively, she pulled Andrea's hands up to her lips, kissing them sweetly. Andrea held her breath, her eyes wide, feeling a flash of heat start in her heart and spread through her abdomen and then through her body. The lips pressed so passionately against her skin were silky and warm. She watched as Cassidy lowered her hands and remained still, her eyes closed with so much feeling.</p>
		<p>"So," She whispered hoarsely, her eyes taking in Cassidy's beauty without tiring. "Will you have the picnic with me at Fountain Woods?"</p>
		<p>Cassidy opened her eyes to Andrea's and nodded, staring at the full pink lips. <i>She has such lovely lips.</i> She thought fleetingly. "Yes," She said, smiling tenderly at her. She couldn't say no to her.</p>
		<p>Andrea was delighted, her eyes brightened visibly and she seemed to glow. Their food arrived and they ate, also talking. Andrea did most of the talking. "Roseanne," She was saying with great enthusiasm around her huge chicken sandwich. "You remember her, don't you? Her mother is Carey Mitchell."</p>
		<p>Cassidy nodded, relieved to be out of the intensity of the previous moment. "Yes, I remember her." She said, munching on her own sandwich, a broiled fish delight.</p>
		<p>"Well," Andrea continued, her blue eyes glistening. "The other day, she said to me that..."</p>
		<p>Cassidy allowed her eyes the freedom of taking in Andrea's angelic beauty as she spoke. She could see Andrea blushing slightly, she couldn't wonder why, so intense was her gaze. She laughed at something Andrea said about Roseanne; she was so clearly fond of the girl. Suddenly, she stopped, gazing back at Cassidy. "Talk to me about you." She said, a serious tone in her voice.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's gaze fell to the table; she didn't know what to say. She didn't really like to talk about herself. Andrea asked her about work, knowing Cassidy like the palm of her hand. Or so she thought. "Well, I gave in the article." Cassidy said. "Joel got back to me today. He said he loved it. It'll be published on Wednesday's edition."</p>
		<p>Andrea beamed proudly. "I'm so proud and happy for you, Cassidy! You should never doubt that he would accept it. You're the best." She gushed. She was happy every time Cassidy got a huge story and would pass the test with beaming approval. Even though it happened very often, every single time made Andrea proudly happy.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled shyly. "Thank you." She said in a low voice.</p>
		<p>Andrea smiled, taking another bite of her huge sandwich. "I'm so glad that you didn't say no to my invitation." She said.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's eyes snapped back up to hers and she smiled. "I'm glad too, Andy." She said. "I did not mean to hurt you."</p>
		<p>Andrea reached over to cover her hand again. "I know," She said. "Though I wish you'd tell me why you've been avoiding me."</p>
		<p>"It's nothing, really." Cassidy said, covering Andrea's hand with her other hand. She looked into the eyes of the woman she loved so much and said softly: "I really love you, Andy."</p>
		<p>Andy sighed, feeling very keenly the warmth and softness of the hands enveloping hers. "I love you too, Cassidy." She whispered.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled, wanting so much to be able to kiss her lips. "I'm really glad you do, Andy." She said, taking her hands away and sitting back, her protective shield in place. "I wouldn't know what to do without you."</p>
