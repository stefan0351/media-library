<!-- Noemí \ Chapter Twenty-One -->

<p>Terri sat  by the window, resting a little; the stitches on her abdomen already itched  her in their healing. She smiled softly at the sight in front her on the couch.  Lying on her back with long muscular legs crossed comfortably and eyes closed  in sleep, was Noemí, with little Noemí face down over her chest,  sleeping also. They were breathing softly and evenly, Terri could see her baby's  body rise and fall softly with every breath Noemí took, her tiny stomach  contracted and expanded slightly as she breathed softly. Terri had just breastfed  her, with Noemí watching as if to learn from her actions. Their eyes  met from time to time, and Terri thought she could feel the heat of her gaze,  her body responding with a quivering of its own.</p>
		<p>Noemí  had taken to the baby, and the baby to her. In the middle of the night, when  she woke and cried, when Terri could not get up that easily and even now that  she could, Noemí would get up from the bed, tenderly lift the beautiful  crying child in her arms, and bring her to Terri. She also helped her get up  from the bed, picking her up easily in her arms and transporting her to the  living room when she wanted to change scenery, bringing the baby right away  before she would start crying. Noemí held the baby as many times as she  could, her face softening with tender love every time she looked at her. Occasionally,  she would bring up the question of Terri's feelings for her, but Terri would  avoid answering, not knowing the answer yet.</p>
		<p>It was true,  that she couldn't be away from Noemí for more than a few minutes without  missing her. It was also true that her heart almost skipped out of her chest  every time she laid eyes on Noemí, and that she wanted to hold her in  her arms and never let her go all the time. It was also true that her dreams  were of Noemí only, and that when Noemí was not there with her,  she felt as if something was missing in her. But she didn't know the basis  of her feelings for Noemí. She knew she loved her, just not how much.</p>
		<p>Occasionally,  Noemí would allow a crazy moment to pass, and she would possess Terri's  lips with her own, shaking her foundations with the softness of her lips and  making her want more. But she would do nothing more, telling her that she didn't  want to pressure her; that she wanted Terri's feelings for her to be clear and  true.</p>
		<p>As Terri  recovered Natalie and Thomas visited almost every day, mostly stayed with her  all day helping her until Noemí would return home from work. On the days  that they couldn't visit, Victoria would come, joined by Michaela later, and  they would keep the still healing Terri with company. Their adoration of little  Noemí was endearing and touching. Only five weeks and the baby had already  gained some fans. Martha had already gone to visit the baby several times, holding  gifts in her hands every single time. Noemí bought a small table for  all the gifts, and placed it next to the crib, where Terri adjusted Teddy Bears  and dolls brought by other members of the family. Almost every day, there was  a visitor in the house to see the baby. Today, thank goodness, there wouldn't  be any more.</p>
		<p>Terri relaxed  against the side of the window and began to sketch, her eyes drifting to Noemí  and the baby in her arms.</p>
		<p>Before she  knew it, Noemí and her young namesake were copied onto her paper, without  the color. She stopped when she saw Noemí stir, the sleeping baby made  a small sound, and Noemí's eyes flickered open to the tiny head resting  right below her chin. A soft smile crossed her face, and she looked at Terri,  her smile never fading. "What time is it?" She asked softly, her voice hoarse,  trying not to wake the child in her arms.</p>
		<p>Terri looked  at the miniature grandfather clock on the coffee table that faced her way. "Ten  thirty." She said, and stood gingerly, feeling her scar pull a little. She moved  slowly over to Noemí and reached down cautiously to retrieve the baby.</p>
		<p>"Want to  go to bed?" Noemí asked as she sat up, blinking sleepily.</p>
		<p>Terri nodded  and smiled; she stifled a yawn as she accommodated her baby in her arms. The  child never opened her eyes or complained as Noemí walked behind Terri  towards her bedroom. When both Terri and little Noemí were settled into  bed, Noemí returned to the living room, shutting off the lights. She  then shuffled back to the warmth of the bedroom. She yawned, then looked at  Terri. "Would you prefer to sleep alone tonight?" She asked, knowing fully well  what that would mean for her.</p>
		<p>"No," Terri  said softly, patting the area of the bed beside her. "I'm used to you being  beside me on this huge bed, and I like it. Come to sleep."</p>
		<p>Noemí  seemed relieved, and she removed her sweatshirt, then her sweatpants, remaining  only in a T-shirt, short boxers and socks. Involuntarily, Terri's eyes took  in the defined muscles of her thighs, the tightness of the shirtsleeves on her  strong arms, and she felt suddenly weak and hot with desire. Noemí lay  down beside her on the bed, oblivious to Terri's scrutiny and her state arousal.  She lay down on her back, and then sat up to kiss Terri's lips softly. "Goodnight."  She whispered softly against her cheek, her fingers trailing softly on her arm.</p>
		<p>She lay down  on her back again, and covered her eyes with her arms. Terri shifted slowly,  and lay down on her side facing away from Noemí, trying to stop the shaking  of her body. She reached for the bedside light, and brought the room to darkness.  She remained awake for only a little time, but in that time, she was fully aware  of Noemí's presence right beside her, of her strength and sexy allure.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>She woke a little  while later to a low voice asking for help.</p>
		<p>It was Noemí,  trembling and whispering softly, having a nightmare. She shifted and Terri turned  on her side, trying to see her through the dark. She reached out and touched  her, feeling her cheek. She was feverish and covered in sweat, as she was every  time that a memory-nightmare tormented her. Terri grabbed her shoulder and shook  her gently, whispering her name. Her sleeve, as the rest of her shirt, was drenched  with sweat. Terri shook her again and said her name, louder this time. She knew  Noemí's nightmares didn't come often anymore, but when they did, they  left Noemí as before, senseless in fear and sorrow.</p>
		<p>"Help me,
			<i>please</i>!  Get me out of here, I can't take it!" Noemí said breathlessly, her  hand clutching her pillow tightly.
		</p>
		<p>Terri moved closer  to her, whispering close to her ear: "I'm here, wake up, open your eyes."</p>
		<p>Noemí  jerked upright and began to cry, burying her face in her hands, shaking violently.  Terri reached over in the darkness and touched her shoulder with her fingers.  Noemí turned and reached for Terri, pulling her into a tight embrace.  "Oh God, Terri, I want this to
			<i>stop</i>!" She sobbed quietly in the circle  of her arms for a long time. Slowly, she began to calm down.
		</p>
		<p>Then she rolled  away from her, staring up at the darkness, her moist arms resting heavily against  her forehead. Terri rolled to her, and rested her hand on her stomach, caressing  gently and gazing down at her through the dark. "Noemí," She said gently,  laying her head on her chest. "Why don't you go to therapy? You know you  need to."</p>
		<p>Noemí  took a deep breath and remained quiet. She brought her arms down and wrapped  them around Terri; she turned her head and pressed her face onto her sweetly  scented hair. Her hands stroked Terri's back and Terri shivered. "I need you,  Terri." She whispered softly.</p>
		<p>Terri's lifted  her head to gaze at her; she reached up and touched her cheek gently. "Noemí,  I-" Her voice was cut off as smooth lips covered her mouth in a soft kiss. Her  breath caught as Noemí, never ceasing to kiss her, pushed her down onto  her back. Her arms around her were possessive and demanding at the same time.  Her lips, tender against Terri's, beckoned softly as their kiss deepened.</p>
		<p>Terri slowly  wrapped her arms around Noemí's neck, kissing her back deeply. Noemí  groaned softly against her mouth, rolling onto her back and pulling Terri on  top her. Desire, nothing new to Terri where Noemí was concerned, took  a hold of her. Noemí's hands were firm as they played along Terri's back  beneath her T-shirt, as they moved around her torso, pressing against her ribs  to move right under her breasts. Stopping and pulling her lips slightly away,  she whispered against her lips: "I want to make love with you, Terri. I want  to taste you all over..."</p>
		<p>Terri moaned  softly, feeling her body ignite with a rush of hot desire. She arched her breasts  toward Noemí's hands, her shaking hands grasping Noemí's  strong arms. "Please,
			<i>please</i>!" She gasped, and her body trembled violently,  her breasts aching and hot for Noemí's knowing touch. She pushed her  body frantically against Noemí's, her legs opening to allow Noemí's  thigh between them.
		</p>
		<p>Noemí  rolled them over again and lay on her carefully, pushing her shirt up and kissing  the sensitive area between her soft breasts. She groaned softly as she caressed  her breasts carefully with her hands, kissing lingeringly around her erect nipples.  Terri's legs rose as her back arched; deep pleasure sent a rush of wetness between  her legs. Noemí's strong arms wrapped around her arching body as her  mouth fed on her luscious sensitive breasts. She kissed her way up slowly, kissed  her neck passionately, moaning breathlessly against her skin. "Terri, oh God!  I want you so much!" She groaned, her arms trembling as she pushed herself up.</p>
		<p>Terri threw her  head to the side, moaning. "Noemí, I want you!" She gasped desperately  and reached around her body, yanking up her shirt from behind. "Take this
			<i>off</i>,  Noemí,
			<i>please</i>!" She said, her voice ragged.
		</p>
		<p>Noemí  rose up to her knees, and yanked the shirt off, throwing it somewhere beside  the bed. She helped Terri remove her own shirt, untied the laces of her shorts,  leaned down and kissed her quivering stomach. Following the line of her shorts  with her tongue, she groaned, pulling them down slowly along her thighs. Her  breath caught as she realized that Terri had no panties beneath them, and her  lips touched the healing skin above her thighs tenderly. Terri moaned, her soul  on fire with the body-memory of the brief feel of Noemí's tongue that  Christmas morning. Her stomach quivered harder, her hips rising, her legs opening  again. Her shaking hands reached down to cup Noemí's head and to pull  her down onto her flesh, but to her frustration, Noemí pulled away and  moved up on top of her.</p>
		<p>She pressed her  hips between her legs and allowed her arms to soften. Moans came from deep in  her throat, full of passion and unrestrained desire. They both became keenly  aware of their breasts pressing against each other, softness against softness.  Of their nipples brushing together and sending hot fire through their veins.  Terri could feel the soft material of Noemí's boxers caressing her inner  thighs, pressing against the throbbing center of her need. She pressed her lips  against Noemí's shoulders, nibbling softly with her teeth; her eyes  closed passionately as emotion and desire collided inside her.</p>
		<p>Her hands traveled  the length of Noemí's slender back, she felt the muscles shifting as  Noemí moved on her; her fingers explored the defined muscles, and they  moved lower and slipped beneath the boxers, cupping full muscled buttocks with  a barely restrained moan. "Oh God, Noemí!" She cried out before Noemí's  lips covered hers again, wet and smooth as her tongue slipped deeply into her  mouth. Terri's hands moved up and down her sides, her nails grazing the smooth  skin making Noemí groan and tremble.</p>
		<p>Noemí  adjusted her body, straddling Terri's thigh, as she pressed her own against  Terri's wetness. She began moving her hips in a slow undulation; beginning a  pressure and moaning softly; her strong arms held her up as her lips claimed  Terri's. Terri moaned softly, her hands on Noemí's buttocks pulling  her down hard against her, her own hips undulating against her muscled thigh.</p>
		<p>"Noemí,"  She whispered against possessive lips breathlessly, pushing the boxers down  more, gasping: "Take them off." Noemí lifted her hips to allow her to  push them down over her hips and thighs, and then she rolled over beside her  to push them down. Quickly, she was on her again, placing her center carefully  against Terri's thigh, pressing her own thigh gently against Terri.</p>
		<p>Terri groaned  passionately, cupping her nude buttocks again and pulling her hard against herself  as she raised her thigh to meet her. Noemí groaned in return and began  grinding against Terri's thigh, feeling Terri's wetness grinding up against  her thigh. Her hands tightened convulsively on the sheets, her muscles trembled  from the strain for control. Loudly, Noemí moaned, her breathing quickening,  matching Terri's. Loosing total control, she pressed her mouth against Terri's,  moaning softly into her. Mouths opened to allow tongues passage, lips moved  together passionately. Terri moaned into Noemí's mouth, small hands  gliding down her back; her short nails sank deeply into the taut straining flesh,  her free leg lifted to wrap around her waist and pressed against her buttocks.  Terri's body arched against Noemí's, the feel of the hard thigh  pressing and gliding against her wetness driving her wild with intensity.</p>
		<p>She was torturously  aware of her aching, of the tight shudders in her abdomen; a cry escaped her  throat as a sudden spasm shook her body violently. Her hips rose up again and  again to meet Noemí's. She felt Noemí's strong body above  hers, writhing nimbly against her; she was aware of the wetness gliding smoothly  against her thigh, leaving a trail of wetness. Their lips made love as their  bodies did, Terri's hands caressed Noemí's sweating body as it shuddered  and pulsed against hers.</p>
		<p>A deep husky  moan escaped Noemí's throat; orgasm was so close, so perfectly close?  "Oh God, Terri, oh-" She cried out into Terri's mouth, breathing heavily. "Terri!"  She groaned passionately, her insides clenching tighter and tighter. She breathlessly  said her name over and over as her body thrust against Terri's savagely.  Release came quickly, her body buckling not too gently against Terri's body.</p>
		<p>At the same time,  Terri's body reacted powerfully; she arched wildly, and sweating profusely,  her stomach heaved. Her body jerked upward and her arms around Noemí  tightened as orgasm threatened to break her apart once again. "Noemí,  oh-" She came in wide waves, her hips rising onto Noemí's thigh pressing  her passion against it, her head thrown back, exposing her beautiful neck. She  felt Noemí's soft mouth open on her shoulder, her hard breathing, felt  Noemí's hips driving against her over and over again as orgasm weakened  Noemí's arms and she lay spent and limp above her.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>They lay holding  each other for a long time, sweaty bodies molded comfortably together. Noemí  was on top of her, her lips caressing her neck softly and moving down. "You're  amazing, do you know that?" She whispered breathlessly against Terri's chest.  "You're so beautiful, Terri, in the throes of passion."</p>
		<p>Terri was still  trying to catch her breath; her first orgasm with Noemí had been nothing  compared to what this felt like. "Is this? what it
			<i>feels</i> like? Is  it always? so
			<i>wonderful</i>?" She gasped, her breathing shallow. She  felt the trickle of sweat on her forehead, all over her body.
		</p>
		<p>Noemí  lifted her head and kissed her deeply. "Yes, this is what it's like." She whispered  against her mouth, then said after another deep kiss, her voice teasing: "But  there's always more."</p>
		<p>Terri pulled  back and pushed Noemí's wet hair away from her forehead, caressing her  smooth back with her other hand. She remained silent for a few seconds, in awe  of the beauty of the strong woman lying on top of her. "
			<i>More</i>? What could  be more wonderful than this?" She asked, remembering Noemí's silky mouth  between her legs, feeling herself blush.
		</p>
		<p>Noemí  paused, then kissed her again. After a while, she pulled away and looked at  her closely. "You've never?" She trailed off, hoping that Terri would get  the clue.</p>
		<p>Terri did. "Nothing  more than penetration, if that's what you're asking. And I never felt the way  I do with that, except for when you? you know." She said, and turned her  face away in shame.</p>
		<p>Noemí  grabbed her chin and turned her face, lowering her lips to hers again. After  a long time of kissing softly, she whispered hoarsely against her cheek: "Well,  there is more, and I can show you. There's plenty of time."</p>
		<p>Terri trembled,  as much with desire as with fear of the unknown. She didn't say anything for  a long time and then she kissed Noemí for a long and passionate moment  in answer. Her hands cupped Noemí's face gently, feeling the erotic appeal  of her caressing tongue. She instantly grew aroused again, and there was new  wetness between her legs. Her eyes clenched as a deep shudder shook her body.  "Show me!" She whispered frantically, her fingers straining against Noemí's  back again, her hips already rising.</p>
		<p>Noemí  chuckled softly, and she rose from Terri's body to kneel above her, kissing  her and pushing her tongue into her mouth when she whimpered her complaint.  She kissed her eyelids, her nose, her cheeks, her lips, her chin, and her neck,  over and over, marveling at their silkiness. All the while, one hand was gently  touching Terri's breasts, her fingers touching around her nipples so slowly,  lightly, so torturously gentle, erecting them to aching tips. Her mouth took  one in softly, and Terri's groan was long and full of desire. Her tongue flickered  around the nipple, her teeth bit gently, as her hand moved slowly down her quivering  stomach to the soft hair above her thighs.</p>
		<p>Noemí's  fingers were greeted by intense, hot wetness, by quivering spreading thighs  allowing her passage into the sea of treasures between them. Terri moaned with  growing urgency, her hips lifting as her legs spread in invitation. Without  warning, groaning deep in her throat, Noemí sank her fingers inside her.  Terri's body buckled even as her breath stopped, and then arched hard as a long  moan came from her trembling lips. Noemí moved her lips from Terri's  nipples and moved upwards along her skin; she kept her fingers inside her without  moving them, feeling the wet muscles of her flesh tighten around her deliciously.  She moved to her ear, kissing her way along her neck, and she whispered sensuously:  "How does
			<i>that</i> feel?"
		</p>
		<p>Terri groaned  loudly, she couldn't respond in her quivering breathlessness. Her skin was flushed  red, the sweat running in rivulets down between her breasts, and her hips thrust  rhythmically against Noemí's fingers. "Mm, you have to keep quiet, Terri,"  Noemí whispered sensuously, moving down to lick the sweat from her skin  very slowly then lying down beside her. "The baby will wake up then, and I won't  be able to finish what I've just started." She moved her coated fingers gently,  and Terri groaned, trying to restrain the cries that were gathering in her throat;  her body jerked violently.</p>
		<p>Noemí  could see the muscles of her neck tensing, the tendons sticking out as she held  back a moan.</p>
		<p>Her stomach quivered  against Noemí's arm, her breasts heaved as she struggled for breath,  her body trembled hard, her hips rose to meet the thrust of Noemí's fingers,  her hands clutched at the bed covers frantically as Noemí's fingers began  a smooth glide inside her. "Noemí!" She whispered brokenly, her breathing  shallow.</p>
		<p>Noemí  lifted her face to touch her lips to hers, and then she kissed her sweaty face  gently, moving along at a slower and gentler pace than her fingers inside her.  "Tell me how you feel. Tell me if you want more, Terri. I want to hear you tell  me how you feel?" She whispered, her fingers gaining speed inside her,  gaining strength as they pulled out all the way and glided smoothly in. Her  mouth moved along her neck again, and she bit passionately into the skin above  her breasts, awakening in Terri a wild passion as her fingers made her ache  for release.</p>
		<p>Soon, Terri knew  what Noemí meant when she said there was more. She suddenly knew that  her body and soul could reach different and higher levels of ecstasy, as Noemí's  fingers continued their rhythm. After many, long-lasting orgasms, she couldn't  take any more, and her body buckled as if lightning were running through it,  shuddering violently. Noemí slowly stopped moving her fingers, leaving  them deeply inside her, and allowing them to feel the quivering clench of wet  muscles.</p>
		<p>Terri lay in  Noemí arms, spent and beautifully sore, her eyes closing as she kissed  her shoulder. "That? was so? beautiful, Noemí." She gasped,  shivering, and aware that Noemí's fingers were brushing her wet hair  away from her forehead. "That was amazing, I never thought it would be so wonderful."  She paused, and lifted her head to meet Noemí's lips, whispering against  them: "I never thought- I-" And then she lay her head down and fell asleep.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>She was sure  she heard her baby crying, but thought it was a dream until she felt the bed  shift noticeably as Noemí got up. The bedside light flickered on and  she covered her head with the quilt, groaning sleepily. The baby's throaty cries  came closer to her ear, and she heard a faint chuckle. She turned over and pulled  the quilt from her head, squinting and blinking rapidly as the light tortured  her eyes. She gazed up at little red-faced Noemí, held close to her by  Noemí's tender hands.</p>
		<p>She sat up slowly,  and rested against the headboard, knowing instinctively that it was time to  feed her daughter. "Come here, baby." She whispered tenderly, taking her from  Noemí's hands and adjusting her into a feeding position on her left breast.  The baby found her nipple on her own, eagerly sucking. "Ouch!" She whispered  with a little jump as little Noemí's toothless gums bit her nipple, which  was already tender from Noemí's earlier attentions.</p>
		<p>Noemí  moved to the other side of the bed and climbed under the covers, lying on her  side propped up on her elbow. She gazed at the child in Terri's arms with tender  love. Her eyes met Terri's, and a flash of heat burned Terri's body anew.  "How do you feel?" Noemí asked softly, her smile sensuous and playful.</p>
		<p>"Like a brand  new woman." Terri answered in a low voice, and Noemí moved closer to  kiss her lips lingeringly. Then she leaned her face against her shoulder, and  they both gazed at the baby together. "Isn't she beautiful, Noemí?" Terri  asked softly, her voice full of love. The child was staring up at them with  wide eyes, her lips wrapped hungrily around Terri's nipple.</p>
		<p>Noemí  nodded slowly, a smile curving her lips. She pressed her lips against her neck,  and she felt Terri tremble and moan softly. They gazed down at the child feeding  off Terri's breast, and Noemí whispered in her ear after a while, her  voice sensuously throaty: "I want to taste your nipples in my mouth again."</p>
		<p>Terri moaned,  and threw her head back against the headrest. "Oh, just wait until she's asleep  again." She said in a low quavering voice. They talked as the child fed off  Terri's full breast, her tiny lips sucking the milk with relentless hungry vigor.  Her little hand rested against the side of Terri's breast, the tiny fingers  clenching and unclenching. Terri laughed at something Noemí said, looking  down when little Noemí's hungry sucks turned lazy and eventually  stopped. She was asleep again, her tiny stomach full and protruding adorably  between the line of the diaper and her little baby shirt. Terri knew that she  had to burp her before laying her down again. She placed her against her chest;  a little towel on her shoulder in case something more than a burp came, and  tapped her tiny back very gently, like Natalie had shown her. She gazed at Noemí,  who was gazing back at her with uninhibited desire. "I can't believe I'm a mother."  She said in a low voice full of loving wonder.</p>
		<p>Noemí  smiled at her and leaned forward to kiss her again. "A beautiful mother at that."  She whispered, trailing her fingers against her inner thigh softly. Terri let  out a long breath, her legs opening against her will. As if on cue, little Noemí's  burp was bigger than life and was followed by two small ones; with a chuckle,  Noemí got off the bed and came around to take the sleeping baby in her  arms. She kissed her tiny forehead very gently and lowered her carefully into  her crib. "She's so well behaved too, we can make love all we want." She whispered,  and turned to the bed, smiling as Terri spread her arms for her to come into.</p>
		<p>Noemí  climbed onto the bed, and moved into her arms with a soft sigh. She pushed Terri  down onto her back and lay on top of her. They kissed passionately for a long  time, tongues twining wetly. They each nuzzled the other's neck, teeth gently  sinking into shoulders, breaths catching, murmuring. Terri reached for the light,  but Noemí caught her hand, kissing it and moving slowly up her arm. She  whispered as her reason, her mouth thirsty and desiring: "I want you to see  this."</p>
		<p>A feeling of  anticipation made Terri's body tense and the inside of her thighs quiver,  her wetness growing intensely. Noemí pushed herself up slightly with  her arms and hovered above her, kissing her again and moving down to her neck  and breasts. Noemí grabbed at a pillow and pulled it beneath Terri's  head, wanting Terri to watch her pleasing her. Terri watched the top of Noemí's  gold-red hair move down, concentrating on feeling her lips moving across the  plain of her stomach, her tongue trailing a line down along her skin. She moved  lower, and pressed Terri's legs open, lifting her knees and holding her open  to gaze at her. She kissed her inner thighs, and Terri groaned, her stomach  quivering all over again with renewed anticipation.</p>
		<p>Spreading Terri's  legs more, pushing her knees down as far as they could go and opening her wide,  Noemí licked her way from each knee and up to her wet outer lips, teasing  deliberately slow. Terri's back arched as she shivered and her eyes closed tightly,  her body tensed and her head pressed against the pillow. From below, Noemí  whispered: "Look at me." Her tongue stroked her wetness, the tip tickling softly.</p>
		<p>Terri's body  jerked and she released a shuddering moan; her hips lifted, inviting more. "
			<i>Look</i>  at me," Noemí whispered again, her warm breath tickling Terri as her  lips kissed right above her wetness; she made a move to get up. "Or I'll stop."  Terri made herself look down, gasping, her face flushed and sweaty. "Hold your  legs, baby." Noemí instructed softly, kissing her inner thighs again,  reaching up and grasping Terri's shaky hands and pulling them down to her legs  to make her grasp right below her knees, holding them open. "Mm, that's  it." Her tongue stroked her wetness again, firmer now and Terri moaned, feeling  Noemí's strong shoulders pressing against the back of her thighs.
		</p>
		<p>There were no  words to describe what she was feeling, only the distant memory of Noemí  briefly bending down between her legs. Her legs trembled, her hips rose to meet  Noemí's silky tongue. For a long time, the tease drove her wild, to the  point where she couldn't take any more. She threw her head back again and cried  out, her body tensing, her hips thrusting. She gasped loudly; she sounded like  she was sobbing and her eyes rolled back in her head and she clenched them closed.</p>
		<p>"Look down at  me." Noemí said again, and her fingers caressed her buttocks, kneading  softly as her tongue licked the engorged clitoris very, very softly. Suddenly,  hearing Noemí groan hungrily, Terri felt her tongue sink deeply into  the wetness, taking it in, tasting and feeling it thoroughly. Terri was on fire,  her body weakened deliciously, and her legs fell over Noemí's shoulders  as her hands moved to grab Noemí's head. She gazed down at her with  narrowed eyes, her mouth hanging open as she panted hotly for breath.</p>
		<p>She could feel  the sweat break out of her body again, the hot ocean in her body rise, and her  wetness throbbing hard. She felt swollen and ready to explode. Her head felt  light; the room seemed to spin around her. She pressed the heels of her feet  hard against the small of Noemí's back, lifting her hips to clamp her  throbbing wetness against the hot mouth. "Yes, Noemí!" She groaned, biting  her lower lip. "Please, please, don't tease me!"</p>
		<p>Noemí's  silky mouth took a more substantial feeling, her tongue sinking into her again  and again and then flicking over her engorged clitoris. She moaned thickly as  she thoroughly sucked, licked, tasted her delicious sweetness, felt the silk  of her wet flesh. Her arms wrapped around her hips, her hands flat over her  quivering stomach, and she pulled her down harder onto her mouth, her wrists  pressing downwards against her tense thighs.</p>
		<p>Terri groaned,  turning her face onto her pillow and crying out against it. She sobbed, turning  her face to breathe loudly: "Oh God-
			<i>Noemí</i>! I'm com-
			<i>I'm com</i>-"  Her voice broke into a prolonged moan, her hands grasping the pillow to the  back of her head, her face contorted and red as ecstasy melted through her.  Over and over again, her body trembled and her hips twisted, cries leaving her  throat like wails. For a long time, Noemí held her as orgasm shot through  her body like fire, her fingers slipping deep inside her again to feel the wet  vibrations, her wet face pressed against her heart.
		</p>
		<p>Eventually, Terri  lay spent beneath Noemí, unable to move much less talk. She tried, and  gave up, seeking Noemí's embrace. "Oh Noemí!" She said after a  long time, drifting to sleep again before she knew it.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Her head resting  on Terri's soft stomach, Noemí was dreaming. This time there were no  nightmares, no tears, and no pain, only peacefulness. It was too real.</p>
		<p>She is standing on a rocky  beach, the water laps generously against the shore, the white foam of the  waves lingering before being sucked back into the sea. The sun shines brightly,  a yellow-white hot ball of fire on the white sky. It doesn't burn her,  but it warms her, giving her comfort. The water is a yellow-white color also,  and the sounds it emits are wonderful to Noemí's ears. Like music.  It's all so realistic, yet so dream like.</p>
		<p>She feels truly peaceful inside  for the first time in a long time.</p>
		<p>"Does this mean I can  say goodbye?" A familiar voice asks behind her.</p>
		<p>Noemí spins around,  shocked. Amelia stands there, hands on her hips, beautiful, as she had always  been. Short and black curly hair frames her slender face like a halo. Beautiful  brown eyes reflect the light of the sun and twinkle as tears fill her ethereal  eyes. Her lithe, yet shapely body is covered with a robe-like sheet, shoulders  and arms bared.</p>
		<p>Noemí chokes up with  tears, her eyes taking in everything about Amelia. "Amelia!" She  gasps, bringing the back of her trembling hand to her quivering lips. "Oh  God, are you
			<i> real</i>?"
		</p>
		<p>Amelia's arms open in  welcome; a radiant smile opens her full lips to reveal perfect teeth. "I'm  very real." She says in her soft melodic voice.</p>
		<p>Noemí walks into her  arms, sobbing in happiness and burying her face into the crook of Amelia's  soft neck. "I've missed you so much!"</p>
		<p>Amelia nods, lips pressed against  her temple. "I know," She says. "I've been watching you."  She runs her fingers through Noemí's soft hair, just like she  used to when they hugged or made love.</p>
		<p>Noemí pulls her head  back and their lips meet hungrily. Memories of their time together flash behind  Noemí's eyes, and her body responds with a familiar hunger and  desire. She fumbles with Amelia's robe, but Amelia grasps her hands.  Noemí can see she is breathing hard, just like her. "What?"</p>
		<p>Amelia swallows hard. "We  don't have a lot of time, Noe." She says shakily.</p>
		<p>"Why?" Noemí  demands, panicking. "Where are you going?"</p>
		<p>"Back home." Amelia  says, and sits on a nearby boulder; she gestures Noemí to join her.</p>
		<p>"Where is home?"  Noemí asks, calmer. She sits down beside her and feels comforted when  Amelia takes her hand. "I want to come with you." She says decisively.</p>
		<p>Amelia smiles softly, her eyes  shining love as she looks at Noemí. "Oh, but you can't, my  love." She says with a chuckle. "My home is the place where you  go when you die. You haven't died."</p>
		<p>Noemí shakes her head  stubbornly. "I still want to come with you." She says.</p>
		<p>Amelia's smile grows as  she studies her. "What about Noemí Imogene?" She asks melodically.  " Beautiful Name it is, Noemí Imogene." She says slowly,  looking out at the horizon, tasting the name in her mouth. "Noemí  Imogene, she and I think alike." She looks at Noemí again, her  eyes full of love.</p>
		<p>Noemí is smiling sweetly,  the sound of the baby's name does that to her. "You've seen  her?" She asks softly, meeting Amelia's radiant eyes.</p>
		<p>Amelia chuckles, squeezing  her hand gently. "Yes, I have." She responds. "She is beautiful,  and so is her mother."</p>
		<p>"Terri." Noemí  whispers, her eyes glazing over at the thought of her.</p>
		<p>Amelia chuckles and squeezes  her hand gently. "Yes, Terri," Amelia asserts. "They're  waiting for you, back home." Noemí looks at her with confused  eyes. "This is just a meeting place for loved ones from either side."  She explains, making a sweeping motion with her free hand.</p>
		<p>Noemí nods in understanding.  "Where is your home?" She asks again.</p>
		<p>Amelia grins. "It's  a beautiful place, the sun always shines, and everyone loves each other."  She says. "Everyone knows everyone, we all get along, it's heaven.  I wish you could see it, and for a while I thought you would, but now you're  not going to cross over as soon as everyone expected."</p>
		<p>Noemí frowns. "What  do you mean?" She asks.</p>
		<p>"Well," Amelia says,  shrugging. "In a way, I'm very grateful to your irresponsible brother.  If he hadn't seeded that child within Terri, she wouldn't have come  into your life, and neither would have that beautiful child. She's yours  too, now." She smiles gently. "If Terri hadn't come into your  life and turned you around, within a year, you would have been ill, maybe  you would have killed yourself driving drunk, or you would have come up with  a deadly liver disease that would have consumed you quickly. You were due  to come up in about a year. But now you have a whole life to live, your body  is almost completely cleansed from that disgusting drinking, and your heart  is healing. I just wanted to see you to say goodbye, and to give you the go  on loving." She breaks off and looks over her shoulder.</p>
		<p>Noemí looks behind them  also, and sees to the distance, a white light that is growing. Her hand around  Amelia's tightens. "Don't go, Amelia." She pleads tearfully.</p>
		<p>Amelia looks at her with the  most tender of expressions. She stands up and pulls Noemí to her. She  kisses her lips gently. "You and Terri are meant to be." She whispers  against her lips, she pulls back and stares at her with watery eyes. "You're  so beautiful, my love, you always were. Be happy." She starts to turn  towards the light.</p>
		<p>Noemí watches her walk  away, the tears streaming down her cheeks. Just before Amelia walks into the  light, she calls out: "Wait!" Amelia turns to look at her, those  gorgeous brown eyes glistening with tears and ethereal health. "Our baby,  where is it?" She whispers brokenly, not able to say it loud, hoping  Amelia hears her over the sound of the sea.</p>
		<p>But Amelia hears her as if  she said it in her ear. She smiles gently, and she says: "She is with  you, Noemí Imogene." She lifts a slender hand and waves. "Remember  that I love you, always have and always will. Be happy?" She turns  and walks into the light, the white light grows, momentarily blinding Noemí,  and then disappears. Just then, Noemí feels everything around her fade.</p>

			<p>She opened her eyes slowly,  and found that it was still dark. She was now lying on her back, an arm dangling  from the bed. The faint silhouette of Terri's body caught her attention,  and she moved closer, wrapping her arms around her, sighing peacefully when  Terri burrowed deeper into her embrace. Sleep overtook her again.</p>
