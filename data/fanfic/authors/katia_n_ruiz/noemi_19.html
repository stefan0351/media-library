<!-- Noemí \ Chapter Nineteen -->

<p>Camilla stood in front of Noemí the following Monday, looking down at her, an envelope clutched in her trembling hand. She jerked it towards Noemí, not meeting her eyes. "What is this, Camilla?" Noemí asked softly, picking up the envelope and glancing at it before looking up at her.</p>
		<p>"My resignation letter." Camilla said through clenched teeth, fighting back tears as she finally met Noemí's eyes. "I can't continue to work with you, not under these circumstances."</p>
		<p>"But Camilla," Noemí said, walking around the desk towards her, feeling a deep sadness when Camilla jerked away from her. "Please, reconsider, you've been with this company for too long to-"</p>
		<p>Camilla spun around and glared at her. "This is about
			<i>you</i>, don't you see?" She hissed, and clenched her fists at her sides. Noemí moved back, fearing she might hit her again like she did on Christmas day. "You've hurt me, Noemí, you knew how I felt for you, and you still hurt me."
		</p>
		<p>Noemí shook her head, and ran a hand through her hair. "You know my situation, you know that I have unresolved business when it comes to my feelings for Amelia!" She said in a rush of words.</p>
		<p>"She's dead!" Camilla cried out, and crossed her arms over her chest. "
			<i>Goddamn</i> you, she's dead!" She sobbed, letting her head fall.
		</p>
		<p>Noemí felt the words bite into her, and she turned away from her. "You shouldn't say that to me." She whispered brokenly.</p>
		<p>"But it's the
			<i>truth</i>," Camilla said, wiping at the tears beneath her eyes. "And this is not about her, this about that woman you have living in your house."
		</p>
		<p>Noemí sighed, knowing where this discussion would end. "Her name is Terri." She said softly.</p>
		<p>"Whatever her name is, she is a predator, she has been after you the whole time." She whispered, again sounding jealous. "She's a slut, she slept with your brother to trap him, and when he wouldn't budge-"</p>
		<p>Noemí spun around and charged at her once again, furious. "You don't know
			<i>shit</i> about what happened between her and my brother, okay? That is not your business, Camilla, when will I get it through your thick skull?" She hissed at her, her white-blue eyes flashing anger.
		</p>
		<p>Camilla, though startled by her anger, didn't show it. She turned away from Noemí. "What bothered me more," She said in a calmer voice. "Is what you did, the hurt, the pain you have caused me. I love you, damn it!" She slapped Noemí's desk hard and leaned against it.</p>
		<p>"I never asked you to love me, Camilla, honestly." Noemí said in a soft whisper, feeling pain for hurting her this way. "Please," She whispered, moving to her, touching her shoulders with her hands. "Please, I never asked you to love me, you knew how it was going to be with us, you knew my heart belongs to Amelia, Camilla."</p>
		<p>"You're sick, Noemí, you know that?" Camilla said with a disgusted whisper. "You can't even face real life, you can't face that she's not around any more. Your mistakes are your own, Noemí, no matter how much you say you still love her, that doesn't excuse what you've done to me." She pulled away from her hands and walked to the door. "My two week notice is in that letter. I had a job offer in California, and hopefully, it's still available." She walked out of the office, leaving Noemí looking after her.</p>
		<p>Noemí went to the door and pushed it closed, leaning against it and letting the tears fall down her cheeks.</p>
		<p>"...Four, Three, Two," The loud downward count of the group of people standing in front of the large screen television, arms around each other, reached its crescendo as the huge ball on forty second street wound down to its zero mark. "One! Happy New Year!" They yelled and screamed, the sound of horns blaring as some pressed their mouths to one end and blew. There were many tears of joy for having survived another New Year, exuberant loving hugs between friends and families.</p>
		<p>Noemí found herself caught between two loving cousins who grew up with her and accompanied in her mischievous acts along with Victoria, Martha and Louis. Noemí searched for Terri with her eyes, and caught sight of her in the arms of both Thomas and Natalie, then in the arms of Victoria's parents, Charles and Andrea Terrence, and then in the arms of Victoria and Michaela. As she made her way to Terri, Victoria moved forward and took her into her arms, hugging her tightly and giving her an extravagant kiss on the lips. "Happy New Year, best bud!" She said, already skunk drunk.</p>
		<p>Noemí laughed softly, and winked at her.</p>
		<p>Michaela took her place, and kissed her lips also, hugging her briefly and then pulling away. "Happy New Year, and be there many more." She intoned, her eyes twinkling with tipsiness. "Nineteen ninety nine, finally."</p>
		<p>Next were the parents, who with their nurturing love took a long time to wish her a happy New Year, welcoming her back from her depression with loving advice. When they finally finished their endearing goodwill, she moved past them, making smiling eye contact with Terri. She pointed behind herself with a thumb. "All it takes to get to you." She said in a low voice, chuckling softly. She moved closer. "Can I wish you a happy New Year, Terri?" She asked, and moved slightly closer.</p>
		<p>Terri stared up at her with those soft gray-brown eyes, her lips parted slightly. She hesitated, and then nodded. She had been avoiding any contact with Noemí all week, but she couldn't be rude on this night. She stepped up to her, and couldn't stop her breath from catching when Noemí's strong arms slipped gently around her enlarged waist. "Happy New Year, Noemí." She whispered softly, bracing her arms on her shoulders to pull her into a hug.</p>
		<p>Instead, Noemí's lips touched her own softly, tenderly. She gasped softly, unable to help her response. She moaned softly when she felt Noemí's lips move against her own, opening to allow her tongue to slip past her lips and touch her tongue gently. Desire claimed her again; like that night that seemed so long ago. She pulled her mouth away and pressed against Noemí's shoulders when she felt her start to move forward to kiss her once more. "No... Stop... your parents." She gasped softly.</p>
		<p>Noemí's turned her face to look at her parents and Victoria's, they were undaunted as they talked quietly, drinks in hands. Everyone had calmed down from celebratory hugs and kisses, and they were now partying away. Victoria and Michaela were dancing among a group of young people dancing too, the music soft and modern. "They're not even paying attention, Terri." She said, and leaned to kiss her lips again.</p>
		<p>Terri stubbornly pushed against the muscles of her shoulders again, at the same time marveling at their definitive strength. "Please, Terri, don't push me away. I so want to kiss you again." Noemí said, her voice husky as she leaned forward again, pushing against Terri's hands and kissing her once more, her soft moan electrifying Terri. Her lips were passionate, her hands now in her hair and holding their mouths together, her lips gentle and conveying her desire also. She pulled away only slightly, a soft whisper against Terri's lips: "Oh, Terri! Terri, I've missed you so much." She kissed her fully again, and Terri could do nothing but respond to her deeply passionate kiss, her breath catching in her throat.</p>
		<p>After a long time of loosing herself in the kiss, she pulled away, jerking backwards when Noemí reached for her again. The pleading look in Noemí's sexy eyes beckoned her back, but she resisted. "No!" She said, wiping at her lips, attempting to remove the sweet taste and scent of Noemí from her senses. She turned away from her and made her way carefully through the crowd, her small frame disappearing through a throng of tall bodies. Noemí stared after her with a confused feeling rushing through her.</p>
		<p>Noemí allowed Terri into the house in front of her, following her in and closing the door, slipping her keys in her pockets. Silent, Terri made her way down the hall to her room, feeling extremely tired, but restless. It was almost daylight outside, six in the morning of January first in the New Year of nineteen ninety-nine. Noemí stood by the window, staring out at the snow, hands in her slack pockets. She felt tired too, but couldn't lie down to sleep, unless she was near Terri. Terri made it obvious that she didn't want her in her bed today; that she wanted to be alone.</p>
		<p>Resigned to remain awake despite her tired body, she sat down and stared out at the whitening sky, thinking for a long time. Unprepared for Terri's voice, she jumped when Terri called her over to the room. Worried, she made her way there, and sighed with relief at the sight of Terri, standing with a hand pressed against her lower back, eyes staring down at the boxed canvases and oils. She'd already changed her party dress to the familiar shorts and large T-shirt she'd grown accustomed to. She looked at Noemí, her eyes alert despite the obvious tiredness. "Can you please take out a canvas? I suddenly feel like painting." She said, and smiled at Noemí forgivingly.</p>
		<p>Noemí smiled back at her and moved forward to pick up a box. In minutes she had the canvas set up on the tripod, and her paints were set up on top of one of the night tables so that she wouldn't have to bend down to retrieve them. Terri began to set up her colors on the palette in her hand, bought by Natalie in the shape of a circle; her brushes set up standing inside a cup, another cup beside it filled with water to rinse them. Noemí watched, fascinated, sitting on the bed. "Mind if I watch?" She asked softly.</p>
		<p>Terri turned to her and smiled, seemingly at peace for the first time ever. Noemí couldn't take her eyes away from her face. "No, just be quiet." She says gently. Seeing Noemí's tired expression, knowing she had been dancing the whole night with her family and friends because she'd been watching her the whole time from a distance, she said comfortingly: "You can lay down if you want."</p>
		<p>Noemí, feeling comforted by her sweet voice, nodded and lay down on her side, resting her head against a plush pillow. She sighed contentedly, inhaling the sweet scent of Terri on the pillow, burying her face against it. Before Terri had even begun to lay the stained brush to the white canvas, her eyes closed and she fell asleep.</p>
		<p>Terri felt a jolting pain in her lower back and abdomen, and pulled her brush away from the canvas, listening with her body to the unfamiliar pain. She turned around and placed the palette on the table, her brush, hair down, into the cup of water. She looked at Noemí, who looked so peaceful in her sleep, and decided not to wake her yet. A cold sheen of sweat broke out on her forehead, and she moved towards the other side of the bed, wanting to sit down and relax. She thought that maybe she strained herself standing there painting for all those hours.</p>
		<p>In her deep slumber, Noemí didn't move as Terri flopped herself down onto the bed, adjusting herself so that her aching back rested against her pillow and the wall. Another jolting pain coursed through her, making her muscles clench tight, her teeth clench in pain. She closed her eyes tightly, feeling like an explosion had broken through her, and the next thing she knew, water, pink with blood, spilled all over the bed from between her legs, soaking through the quilt and mattress, dripping to the carpeted floor. Fear, like she never felt before, gripped her as another shock of pain paralyzed her and cut off her breath. Noemí didn't even shift in her deep sleep. "Noemí!" Terri whispered, clutching her protruding lower stomach tightly, as if trying to hold her baby in place. She instinctively knew her baby would be born soon, and with no help, if she couldn't get her voice to operate.</p>
		<p>In her fright, she tried to remember what her Lamaze teacher had taught her and Victoria, but her mind was a blank. "Noemí!" She said, louder this time, as another burst of pain tore through her lower body. "Oh, God, Noemí!" She screamed, gasping for breath.</p>
		<p>Noemí jumped from sleep, jerking upright into a sitting position, and spun to stare at Terri. Terri's face looked flushed, her breathing short gasps, her body trembling and there was pinkish wetness all over the bed. She took it all in, and reached for the pillows, moving around the bed to try to get her more comfortable. She could feel the wetness of the carpet sipping through her socks. As she reached for her, Terri slapped her hands away. "I'm in pain, Noemí, please!" She said in a gasping whisper.</p>
		<p>Noemí didn't know what to do; she started to feel shaky and helpless, and she couldn't speak. On a whim she moved to Terri and grabbed her arm, placing it over her shoulders around her neck, holding her back, slipping the other arm beneath her legs and lifting her, not caring about the thick wetness sticking to her arm. She made her way out of the room, holding Terri to her carefully. Terri gasped. "Stop, stop!" She whispered, and Noemí stared at her, confused. "Listen to me, Noemí, I know you're scared right now, but I need you to stop and call Travis."</p>
		<p>Noemí nodded, and placed her down on the couch, reaching for the phone beside the couch. She dialed the first three numbers, and remembered no more. Tears spilled from her eyes and she looked at Terri helplessly. "I can't remember the numbers!" She sobbed.</p>
		<p>Terri groaned loudly as another sliver of pain, stronger this time, like her hipbones being pried apart, shoots through her lower body. "Five three four two!" She groaned and gasped; she grasped her stomach in her hands. "Tell him you think the baby is here! Oh, God!" She groaned, and threw her head back and cried out.</p>
		<p>"Travis, Travis, thank God!" Noemí gasped into the phone, crying. "Please, it's Terri! I think the baby is coming, I think it's time! But it's so
			<i>soon</i>!" She sounded lost and frightened. "What is going on?" She listened, and nodded, then said: "Okay, okay, Saint John's." She threw the phone down and reached for the groaning and writhing Terri; lifting her up easily, she held her close as she carried her outside, feet bare despite the cold.
