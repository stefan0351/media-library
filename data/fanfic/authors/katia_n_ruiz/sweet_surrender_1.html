<!-- A Sweet Surrender \ Prologue -->

<p>It was Valentine's Day. </p>
		<p>A day made for lovers, for best friends, for family; a day for everything that had to do with love. In the street, the knowledge of this day seemed to be so tangible. It seemed as if all the lovers of the world came out, walked about with their hands clasped together, their eyes locked to one another, everything locked together. Best friends allowed themselves the freedom to hold each other longer than usual. Hallmarks and other stores for lovers, friends and family, overflowed with customers. Stuffed animals, big and small, were practically sold out, cards too, distraction was evident on people's faces.</p>
		<p><i>If only best friends could also be lovers</i>, Cassidy Monsignor wished silently, sighing audibly. Her light golden brown eyes scanned the crowd with amusement, watching it as it turned almost rampant. <i>Last minute shoppers, </i>she reflected with a smile. The line to the cashier was long and slow, people were loosing their patience, audibly complaining. Cassidy looked down at the two stuffed animals she held. The soft white bear with the little red heart attached to its chest was for Andrea, her best friend, with whom she happened to be desperately in love. The other, a pink puppy, was for her "lover-of-the-month,"- as many people reflected of her dating habits- she smiled at the thought, Robie. She still had to get flowers and jewels for both of them.</p>
		<p>She reflected on this "lover of the month" business, frowning. It seemed to her that she didn't last with a woman long enough to start a relationship, much less to fall in love with. Either she'd grow tired of the woman, or the woman would assume that nothing would come out of her association with Cassidy. Robie hadn't been smart enough as of yet, but that was okay. She didn't push Cassidy for anything; she seemed to be on her own little agenda of single life, like Cassidy. Cassidy liked her, very much, but the attraction was purely sexual. Sex with Robie, whose name really was Robin, was immensely great, but there was no mind or heart bonding of any kind, like there was when someone was in love. When they weren't having sex, she and Robie would talk; they would tell each other things, getting to know one another.</p>
		<p> Cassidy was so deep into her thoughts that she didn't realize she'd reached the cashier. The young woman behind the counter smiled at her as she snapped her back to attention. She was attractive, long black hair picked back into a ponytail, brown eyes flirty and sensuous. Cassidy's eyes focused again, she apologized as she placed the little stuffed animals on the counter. The cashier woman, whose nametag said "Amistad", was methodically running the little price tags through the scanner with graceful hands. It was so obvious to Cassidy, and everyone who watched, that she was stalling, and shamelessly flirting. She sent little dimpled smiles in Cassidy's direction, attempted to make small talk. Cassidy was amused, and at the same time thoughtful. <i>Why can't Andy look at me like that?</i> She wondered almost childishly. <i>Hell, every other woman seems to!</i></p>
		<p>And that was true; it seemed that everywhere she went there were at least two women who hit on her, straight or lesbian. It was annoying at times, but some times she liked it, especially when she felt an attraction in return, when she couldn't help but want at least a little romp with them. Those moments went by quickly and satisfactorily; she knew how to avoid them afterwards, or how to manage it so that they didn't ask for anything more from her. Robie had been the one to approach her, with a little help from a mutual friend, pointing out that there would be no strings attached, that she was not looking for a serious relationship with anyone either.</p>
		<p>Andy wasn't like Cassidy, she was more a home person, and she liked being in a one on one relationship, believed in faithfulness and foreverness. She told Cassidy so, but never made a big deal of Cassidy's lifestyle, she was the sweetest woman in Cassidy's world, and no one could change that. It had been a little over a month since she'd last seen her and that made her conscience and heart cry out. She'd been the one avoiding seeing her, had been the one holding back.</p>
		<p>It was all because of Jeffrey.</p>
		<p>She felt a flash of fury at the thought of Jeffrey Rosenthal, Andrea's boyfriend. She didn't like him, and she knew he felt the same way about her. There was no love lost between them. She knew he was aware of her deep feelings for Andrea, knew that every time he kissed Andrea in front of her and smiled, he felt he was winning a battle.</p>
		<p>In the past year, ever since Andrea began her relationship with Jeffrey, Cassidy held back and had stopped calling so often, though she was always there every time Andy needed her.</p>
		<p>She paid the cashier without so much as a second glance, and left the store. She still had things to do before her double date that night. Doubles date that included Andrea and Jeffrey.</p>
		<p>Andrea Cates smiled to herself as she wrapped the gift slowly and neatly. It was important to her that Cassidy like it. She paused as she thought of her best friend. Her Cassidy, who'd always been there when she needed her, who was so sweet and loving. She knew Cassidy had been avoiding her, even though she'd always been there when she needed to. She would see her that night, as a matter of fact, after not having seen her in over a month. Occasional phone calls were all they would have; Cassidy was distant and Andrea wanted to know why.</p>
		<p>Every time she asked Cassidy if it was because she didn't love her anymore, like a child seeking approval, Cassidy would protest and convince her otherwise, but as soon as they were on safer ground, she would pull back again. Andrea would be hurt; Cassidy had <i>always</i> been there before.</p>
		<p>Andrea smiled as she remembered happier moments with Cassidy. They'd grown up together, their families being so-so close friends. Andrea came from a loving Caucasian family, a family that welcomed Cassidy, even though she seemed to be different. They were a family that was close, two older brothers and a little sister, that being Andrea. They all had hearts too big for their bodies, and everyone loved them. Cassidy's family was completely the opposite. Cold parents and no siblings had caused Cassidy to grow up cold and almost unyielding.</p>
		<p>Andrea always managed to break her ice, she never wondered how. But she knew that having made sure that Cassidy visited her everyday, that her unyielding parents allowed her to come over, had made a small place in Cassidy's hard heart to be warm. And that was what made them best friends. Andrea was the one who kept their friendship alive, practically since they'd been born. They went to school together, took all kinds of courses just so they could be together. They rode bike together after school, learned how to roller-skate together, and told their deepest secrets to one another. So when Cassidy told her of her sexuality, Andrea took it without question and accepted her the way she was. She accepted her girlfriends, and made sure <i>her</i> boyfriends weren't bigots and made sure they went on double dates together.</p>
		<p>Cassidy's family turned their backs on her and disowned her without a thought. Cassidy had attempted suicide, and her parents didn't care. Andrea was all Cassidy had. Andrea helped her out; her parents were helpful also, providing a roof for Cassidy. Cassidy won a scholarship for her writing ability, and was lucky to have been accepted into one of the best schools for journalism there was. Andrea had been there all the time, had comforted her when she cried disconsolately, had helped her with money whenever she needed it. Cassidy always told her she wouldn't be where she was now if it weren't for her.</p>
		<p>Andrea knew that was definitely the truth.</p>
		<p>Cassidy was successful as a writer; her books were all over the bookstores, bought non-stop by fans. She also wrote lesbian fiction, and had a vigorous following of old and young lesbians. Andrea, though she didn't consider herself a lesbian, had read all of her books and articles, and loved them. Cassidy also wrote for a newspaper and was very recognized for her journalism skills.</p>
		<p>Andrea snapped back from her thoughts of Cassidy and realized she hadn't moved a finger. She glanced at the clock hanging from the wall. FIVE THIRTY!</p>
		<p>She had to start getting ready.</p>
		<p>Her hands began to work on the gift again.</p>
		<p>Robie Stanfield opened the door to find Cassidy there. She felt a shiver run through her body as Cassidy smiled her sensuous half smile. Robie's brown eyes ran the length of her lithe body, liking what she saw. Cassidy's dark hair was long and wavy, flowing thickly down her back and over her wide shoulders. She wore dark blue slacks that were snug around her thin waist and a peach colored sleeveless V-neck sweater, nothing underneath it. Her skin was bronze and flawless, her neck long and graceful. Robie finally looked up at her face, a face that left her sighing, so beautiful it was.</p>
		<p>Robie finally invited her in, unaware of the things Cassidy held in her hands. "Robie," Cassidy said with a husky voice, as she pushed the door closed. Robie turned around to face her and Cassidy stepped up close to her. Robie closed her eyes; she could smell the delicious scent of Cassidy's Dolce & Gobbana cologne. "Happy Valentine's day." Cassidy said softly, her Portuguese accent thick, and pressed her soft thick lips to hers. She knew the effect she had on women, and she relished it. She pulled back and handed her the pink roses and stuffed pink puppy, along with a gift-wrapped box. "You're ready, I see." She whispered huskily, looking Robie over.</p>
		<p>Her golden eyes ran the length of Robie's body, slowly and sensuously. Her eyes danced. Robie could feel her intense eyes on her; she shivered. She wore a red silk dress that reached down to her knees; her shapely legs were bare. She wore red high heels, but she was still shorter than Cassidy's five-foot-nine frame. She attempted to concentrate on her gifts from Cassidy, which included a gift-wrapped box of DKNY perfume, but she was painfully aware of Cassidy's eyes on her body. She felt so lucky, that a woman as gorgeous as Cassidy should waste her time with her was a mystery. Though Robie was very attractive, she felt that she was nothing compared to someone like Andrea or Cassidy.</p>
		<p>"Do we go?" She asked, her voice breathy, her body trembling with desire. Cassidy was looking at her with such heat in her eyes, she felt as if she were being touched by it.</p>
		<p>Cassidy smiled softly, a jolt of sexual energy radiating through her. "Where's my gift?" She asked hoarsely.</p>
		<p>"How could I have forgotten?" Robie exclaimed as she hurriedly left the living room and came back with a small velvet box in her hand.</p>
		<p>Cassidy took it and kissed her again, lingeringly on the lips. She opened the little box and smiled at what was inside. A gold plate, with "Cassidy" spelled out with diamonds. It came with a medium-thick gold chain. Cassidy lifted it out of the little box and looked at Robie with smiling eyes. "Put in on me, I love it." She said gently.</p>
		<p>Robie stood very close as she clasped the chain behind her neck, then she let it drop, rested her arms on her shoulders. "Tonight," She promised softly. "I'll give you an even better present."</p>
		<p>Cassidy threw back her head and laughed, revealing a set of beautifully straight and even white teeth. "I'm sure you will." She said softly.</p>
		<p>Jeffrey kept the smile on his handsome face as Andrea stared at her gift with a surprised smile. The little gold plate with her whole name inscribed into it was beautiful. She smiled at him, a genuine sincere smile. <i>She's so beautiful!</i> He thought as he kissed her softly. She had the kind of hair that was always made people want to touch it and run their fingers through it. It was soft and curly; dark, people said black. Her sweet smile made people smile also, made people unwittingly fall in love with her.</p>
		<p>She was small, seemingly delicate, she made people want to take care of her, and she could pass for someone of the age of sixteen. Her eyes were blue, like the sky. She had a beautiful oval-shaped face, her nose was thin and straight, her lips were soft and glistening invitingly. But the truth was that she was as independent as a person could be, took care of herself, lived on her own and liked it. She taught tenth grade English at a high school, was loved by all of her students.</p>
		<p>But there was one exception to her rule of independence, one exception Jeffrey hated, and that was Cassidy Monsignor.</p>
		<p>Every time Andrea was having a hard time about something, the first person she'd call would be Cassidy. God, how he hated her! And he couldn't say anything at all to Andrea, because he knew he'd loose her. He was so glad Cassidy disliked him enough to strain and pull back on her friendship with Andrea. And that surprised him, because she was so in love with her that she couldn't hide it. But soon, he'd make the move to take her completely away from Cassidy, the move he knew would destroy Cassidy completely and make her pull away forever, and that would be to ask Andrea to marry him.</p>
		<p>He would win the war, a war Cassidy wasn't even trying to win. Jeffrey smiled smugly to himself as he helped Andrea into her jacket.</p>
