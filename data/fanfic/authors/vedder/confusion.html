<p>Niles sat alone at home yet again depressed about Daphne. Sure he had Mel
in his life, and sure, she did make him happy but that just wasn't enough;
Mel wasn't Daphne, she never would be, and he and Daphne would never be.
He sighed, and took another sip of his wine. What have I ever done to
deserve this? He thought to himself and shook his head.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Daphne was at Cafe Nervosa with Roz telling her about the last
minute wedding plans she still had to make.</p>

<p>"...and the hors d'oeuvres will be served AFTER the dinner before the dancing and
speeches..." she was telling Roz. Roz noticed though, that Daphne didn't
have that same 'perk' in dealing with the wedding as she had before she
found out about Niles' feelings for her.</p>

<p>"Daphne?" she asked, interrupting her. Daphne looked up.</p>

<p>"Yes?" she replied. Roz sympathetically shook her head.</p>

<p>"Why are you doing this to yourself?" she asked her friend. Daphne looked at
her, Roz not buying her sorry act of confusion.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she replied, knowing exactly what Roz was talking about.</p>

<p>"You clearly are having second thoughts about going through with this
wedding..." Roz told her.</p>

<p>"I am NOT!" Daphne insisted.</p>

<p>"Well, then you are at least about going through with it as Donny being the
groom..." she looked Daphne right in the eye, "..Donny and not Niles... Am I
right?" she asked. Daphne looked down.</p>

<p>"I-- I don't know what to think about it, Roz..." she answered quietly, "I
mean, I can't stop thinking about him... ever since I found out his
feelings, it's not leaving my mind..."</p>

<p>"And what is it that you're thinking about when you think about it?" Roz
asked, wanting answers. This was going to be juicy, and she wanted to know.
Daphne took a sip of her tea, and then fidgeted with her napkin.</p>

<p>"I can't say it..." she said nervously.</p>

<p>"Can't say what??" Roz wanted to know, "and why can't you say it??"</p>

<p>"I can't say it because..." she began to reply, obviously very
uncomfortable, "..because once I say it, it will become more true... I mean,
when I think about it now, it's ME thinking it and no one else. But once I
tell you, it's in the open, it becomes a reality."</p>

<p>"Daphne, I am your best friend," Roz replied, "if you can't tell me, who are
you going to tell? Frasier??"</p>

<p>Daphne's eyes widened.</p>

<p>"NO," she said quickly, "most definitely NOT."</p>

<p>"Then tell me.." Roz begged her friend. Daphne looked down and took a deep
breath.</p>

<p>"Well... I-- I think I may have feelings for Dr. Crane," she said quietly,
almost ashamed of herself, "..and not just simple feelings, strong feelings
as to where I think I may be falling in love with him." She kept her head
down, not seeing Roz's eyes widen. She hadn't expected to hear THIS much!</p>

<p>"Oh my god, Daphne... what are you going to do?" Roz asked her in disbelief,
"Are you going to tell Niles??"</p>

<p>"No, I can't do that..." Daphne said, looking as if she were about to cry.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Roz asked, "You should NOT be scared of him not loving you back
anymore, Daphne. He is in love with you. In love. This is not the 'in love'
that comes and goes for just anybody... he has felt this for seven years
now, and not just for anybody - only for you."</p>

<p>"I just... I'm engaged, the wedding is in two weeks..." she took a deep
breath, "...and he has Mel."</p>

<p>"He would do ANYTHING for you Daphne, and only you." Roz told her, "I've
seen how he looks at you, and that's the look that he gets when you enter a
room that is such a rare look that people get from other people. That look
is the look someone has when they see the person that they would rather have
more than anything else in the world and would die for just one chance."</p>

<p>"I'm just.. I'm so scared..." Daphne replied, her voice shaking. Roz felt
sorry for her friend and had to help her.</p>

<p>"What are you scared of?" She asked. "Are you scared that he loves you more
than anyone else he's ever loved?" She asked, meaning for it to be
sarcastic, but Daphne didn't take it that way.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am." She told Roz.</p>

<p>"Wha?" Roz asked in disbelief, "How..? If someone felt for me as strong as
he feels for you, I would jump on the opportunity."</p>

<p>"I'm scared that I would do something, break his heart, and loose his
friendship," she said, "that thought terrifies me."</p>

<p>"That is a scary thought Daphne," Roz replied, "But think about this; would
you rather live in fear of what could be, OR would you rather live with it
and have someone love you more than anything till the day he dies..?"</p>

<p>"I..." Daphne was stumped. She knew what she wanted, but she didn't know how
she would approach it.</p>

<p>"You think about that," Roz told her, "I've got to go home now to Alice. My
sitter told me she has to leave right at five. Bye Daph." Roz stood up and
left the cafe. Daphne looked down.</p>

<p>"Damn," she said to herself. She had never felt so helpless in her whole
life.</p>

<p>That night, Niles rang Frasier's doorbell. Niles waited, and no one answered.
He knew his dad was at Duke's, and Frasier had told him to meet him there
after he got off work so they could go to dinner. He obviously had not
gotten home yet. Little did Niles know, that Daphne was out on the balcony
and had not heard the doorbell ring.</p>

<p>"Oh well," Niles said to himself, using Frasier's spare key to open the door
and let himself in, "I'll just wait." He stepped inside, and closed the door
behind him. He noticed that all of the lights were on. Odd, he thought to
himself, but didn't think anymore of it as he went to go help himself to a
glass of sherry. As he finished pouring it, he noticed Daphne out on the
balcony, staring out into the dark night. He stopped for a moment to stare
at her, thinking of how beautiful she really was.  He felt terrible for
still loving Daphne when he had Mel, but he couldn't lie anymore; if he HAD
an opportunity to be with Daphne, he would take it in a second.  Why can't I
just have ONE CHANCE? He thought angrily. He knew one would be all it would
take. Why was it so unfair that he had to be suffering so much only because
all he wanted his one chance to make someone else happy?  If only he was a
little more Daphne's type.  If only he weren't so small-boned, if he weren't
so smart, and, from what he's witnessed, if he only weren't so sensitive...
It just wasn't fair.
He slowly approached the balcony doors, and quietly tapped on them so he
didn't startle her, "Daphne?" he called quietly. She turned around, and
smiled nervously when she saw him.</p>

<p>"Oh hell Dr. Crane..." she said cheerily, "Why don't you join me?" she asked,
inviting him outside. He smiled and happily accepted her invitation.</p>

<p>"What are you doing out here?" He asked, as he stood up beside her and
leaned on the balcony rail as they stared out into the dark night together.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm just thinking about things.." she told him.</p>

<p>"Is it personal, or anything you wish to share...?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"I was thinking about love, actually..." she told him straight out. He
looked over at her.</p>

<p>"...and clearly that led you to think about Donny?" he asked her, his heart
sinking at the sound of THAT word. Donny. How he hated that word now.</p>

<p>"No," she replied softly. Niles looked back up at the sky, his heart
beginning to beat a little bit faster. Could it be that she was having
second thoughts about the whole wedding??</p>

<p>"No?" he asked, "then what if you don't mind me asking?" He heard her sigh
quietly as he just continued to stare forward.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she told him, "just about what true love is. I mean, I love
Donny, but I've been thinking lately, and I don't think that he is my TRUE
love. For some reason our love doesn't seem eternal. I know that he loves
me, but it's not that rare fairy tale love, where he would die just to kiss
me once..." she trailed off, hoping this would get Niles to talk a bit.
Niles looked down a little, and swallowed.</p>

<p>"What would you do if you found someone who felt that way for you?" he asked
her quietly, his heart pounding. He didn't want to get his hopes up again,
even though that was hard. He remembered at the Snowball when he believed
for that one perfect minute that she was finally his to love. How amazing
and alive he felt after that kiss, but how heartbroken he was when he
learned it was all just a simple act on her behalf. He had cried so much
that night. He hadn't felt so devastated until he learned that one horrid
day that Daphne was to marry Donny. Donny. Ugh.</p>

<p>"Ha," Daphne replied, "no one would ever feel that way for me." she told
him, her voice sounding very shaky.</p>

<p>"How could you say that?" he asked her, "You should never loose hope. I know
I never will. NEVER." He had meant that in a way that he figured Daphne
wouldn't understand, but as to where he still took the chance and said it.
He had no idea that Daphne understood exactly what he had meant. She had
never felt such an urge to fall into his arms and feel his arms around her.
She didn't respond to what he had said. Instead, they both stayed silent.
Niles looked at her through the corner of his eyes. She is so perfect, he
thought to himself. Why can't I tell her? Now would be the perfect time to
tell her, we are finally alone. When she breaks my heart and tells me that
she just wants to marry Donny, at least I'll know that I took the chance,
instead of living the rest of my life miserable and hoping for what could
never be. He took a deep breath, and gripped the railing with his shaking
hands.</p>

<p>"Daphne?" he said quietly. She slowly looked over at him. He was staring
down onto the city.</p>

<p>"Uh huh?" she replied. She watched as he closed his eyes and breathed in
deeply.</p>

<p>"I am in love with you," he told her, flat out. He had never felt his heart
pound so hard in his chest. Had he just told her that? Had he just told her
his seven-year-secret??? He couldn't believe what he had just done. Now she
was going to rip his heart from his chest, and THEN where would he be? He
wouldn't even be able to hope and dream anymore. Oh God, he thought, and she
isn't even SAYING anything. He stared down, unaware that Daphne had a smile
on her face. He felt a tear come to his eye; he began to brace himself for
the worst heartbreak he would ever feel.</p>

<p>"Don't worry - I know what to expect," he told her quietly, "but can you
please say something?" He closed his eyes. Here we go, he thought to
himself. But Daphne didn't speak, instead he felt her soft hand glide over
his on the railing. He slowly opened his eyes, and looked over at her, deep
into her eyes. She stared back into his eyes, noticing for the first time
how blue they actually were. Niles couldn't do anything, he was finally
looking into her eyes the way he had always dreamed he could one day do, and
she was actually staring back at him the same way.</p>

<p>"Daphn--" he began, but she silenced him by softly pressing her lips up to
his. He felt time stop as he slowly closed his eyes and brought his hands up
to touch her face. Every single worry he had about anything washed away, he
was finally kissing the one thing that had ever made sense to him. This was
more perfect than he had ever imagined anything could be. They stood and
kissed, very softly for almost a minute, until they both pulled away. Daphne
opened her eyes first, noticing Niles still had his closed, and his eyebrows
raised. His hands slowly slipped from her face as he opened his eyes and
looked into hers, "I have dreamed of that since the day I met you." He said
softly, weak from the amazement he had just experienced.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry it took so long to happen," Daphne said very quietly, a shy side
of her Niles had never seen. He smiled, a tear coming to his eye. He took
her hand in his.</p>

<p>"This has been the greatest night of my life." He told her. She smiled shyly
at him, then looked inside noticing that Frasier had come home, with Donny
beside him.</p>

<p>"Your brother." She said quickly.</p>

<p>"What?" Niles asked, very confused.</p>

<p>"Your brother is home," Daphne said, "and Donny is here too..." and then she
opened the door from the balcony to go inside. Niles felt disappointment
swarm over him as he stared at Donny. That most perfect, amazing moment was
gone. He followed her inside.</p>

<p>"Hi Sweetie." Donny said, obviously to Daphne. He walked over to her and
gave her a kiss. Niles felt his heart break in two; Donny didn't deserve
her. Daphne pulled away from Donny, and nervously looked over at Niles who
just stared at the two looking as saddened as she had ever seen him look.</p>

<p>"Uhm, Donny Hun..." Daphne began, "can I speak to you in my bedroom alone?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"Sure Sweetie." Donny replied and followed behind her as she headed for her
room. As she passed Niles, she quickly looked up at him, then looked away.
Then they were gone. Did this mean that she was going to break up with him?
Niles wondered to himself. It does, he thought. It means that she is going
to leave him for me. He suddenly felt alive again. Daphne was finally his.
Then he remembered Mel. Mel. He had to talk to her. Tonight.</p>

<p>"Well Niles, what say we head out to dinner now?" Frasier asked his brother.
Niles didn't answer, he didn't even notice that Frasier was speaking to him.
He still couldn't believe what had just happened with Daphne.
"NILES?" Frasier said loudly, snapping Niles out of his own little world.
Niles looked at him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Frasier, yes hello.." he said quickly. Frasier looked at him oddly.</p>

<p>"Are we going to dinner now?" He asked once again.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, I have to cancel," Niles said to him, as he got his jacket and
began heading towards the door, "I just really have to talk to Mel right
now. I'm sorry. Another night." And at that he was gone.</p>

<p>"OK.." Frasier said, suspecting something was up, but didn't think too much
of it because he knew how weird his brother could be.
</p>

<p>Niles had broken up with Mel the night before; he would have liked to remain
friends with her, but she clearly didn't feel the same way. He told her
everything and she screamed that she hated him and she never wanted to see
him again.</p>

<p>But now, he was on his way over to Frasier's to go see Daphne. He carried a
single red rose for her. He couldn't remember ever feeling so alive, and it
was all because of her.</p>

<p>He rang the doorbell ten minutes later, hoping Daphne would answer like
usual. Instead, it was Frasier, but that didn't ruin his good mood. Nothing
could.</p>

<p>"Good morning Frasier!" Niles said happily, stepping inside.</p>

<p>"Niles," Frasier said, "you're looking rather happy this morning. I'm
assuming things went quite well with Mel last night...?"</p>

<p>"I broke up with Mel last night," Niles told him as he looked to see if
Daphne was around.</p>

<p>"Then why are you so happy?" Frasier asked him, not acknowledging the rose
he was holding.</p>

<p>"Because the sun is shining, the birds are chirping, and it is all thanks
to," he stopped when he saw her enter the room, "Daphne." he almost
whispered. He stared at her and smiled; nothing existed around him when he
looked at her.</p>

<p>"Oh, hello." she said, nervously. Niles walked over to her, and handed her
the rose.</p>

<p>"Good morning, my sunshine." he smiled as he leaned over to softly kiss her.
She pulled her head back.</p>

<p>"I--I can't." she replied. Niles stepped back a little, his chest beginning
to tighten.</p>

<p>"What the hell is going on here?" Frasier demanded. They both ignored him.</p>

<p>"Daphne--" Niles began, "what--what is wrong?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to be married in two weeks, that's what is wrong!" Daphne shouted
from her tears, and turned running into her bedroom. Niles felt his whole
world slip away as his heart shattered into a thousand pieces. He felt tears
well up in his eyes, as he quickly went after her. She was already in her
room, the door locked.</p>

<p>"Daph-Daphne--?" he stuttered, tapping on her door as tears fell down from
his eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he heard her reply, "But I can't be with you." Niles didn't
think it was possible, but his heart ripped even more than it had earlier.
He didn't even feel as though any of this was happening.</p>

<p>"Daphne.." he cried desperately, "what about last night...? I-I thought we
were finally together; that you were finally mine to love... I--what did I
do?? If I did ANYTHING, just please... tell me...Daphne..."</p>

<p>"Just go away." she sobbed from inside her room. Niles slowly sank to his
knees as tears streamed down his face. He pressed his head up against her
door.</p>

<p>"Daphne---" he begged in between sobs, "don't do this. Don't do this. We
were meant to be together, Daphne. I love you more than anyone I have ever
loved, and-and I promise I will until the day I die," he paused to wipe
tears from his eyes, "you are my soulmate... my soulmate. Please. C-can't
you just give me one chance.. J-just one will be ALL it would take. I love
you so much." Daphne didn't say anything. "I love you." Niles cried softly
to himself, "I love you."</p>

<p>"I-I-I don't even know what I did---" Niles cried to Roz. They were sitting
in his living room two days later. She had just learned of what had
happened. Niles couldn't stop crying since everything had happened with
Daphne.</p>

<p>"She's confused Niles," was all Roz could manage. Niles sank his head into
his hands.</p>

<p>"B-but I told her that I am in love with her, and then she kissed me... I
thought---I thought we were finally going to be together.. and now... now
she's back with Donny??" He wiped tears from his eyes, "I-I mean, was she
just caught up in the moment?? Was my heart just being played AGAIN like a
toy? WHY DID THIS HAPPEN??"</p>

<p>"It wasn't," Roz told him, "she told me that she was falling in love with
you." Niles slowly turned his head, and looked into Roz's eyes for the first
time since she had arrived at his house over an hour ago. She had never seen
someone look so heartbroken in all her life.</p>

<p>"If she was in love with me, then why am I not holding her in my arms right
now like I should be???" he cried. He shook his head, "why am I like this,
and why does Donny get to have her?? He has NO idea how perfect and special
Daphne is. I have known for SEVEN years... SEVEN YEARS and growing more and
more every single day WITHOUT her even having any idea... and, and I get
THIS." Roz looked down.</p>

<p>"She found out at Christmas." Roz told Niles. Niles stopped.</p>

<p>"Found out what?" he asked angrily, already knowing the answer.</p>

<p>"Frasier..." Roz began, "when he was all doped up on that back medicine...
he accidentally told her how you feel." Niles just stared at nothing.</p>

<p>"No wonder," he said.</p>

<p>"What?" Roz replied.</p>

<p>"No wonder she doesn't want to be with me," he began, starting to get angry
- not at her, but at himself, "she doesn't want to be with me because she
found out at Christmas from SOMEONE ELSE that I have been in love with her
for seven years and not said A THING about it. She probably thinks I am just
another gutless snob. Well, I guess she is right.. but I am the gutless
snob who is going to love her until I die --no matter what."</p>

<p>"She isn't with Donny anymore." Roz informed him. Niles looked at her once
again.</p>

<p>"Wha-- what happened??" he asked.</p>

<p>"She broke up with him." Roz replied.</p>

<p>"What do you mean that she broke up with him?" Niles asked Roz.  He sounded
so hurt, so angry, so confused.</p>

<p>"Yesterday," Roz began, "she broke up with him because she realised that she
didn't truly love him."  Niles shook his head.</p>

<p>"So who does she love?" he asked, his voice trembling, "If not him, and
obviously NOT me..." Speaking those words made his heart ache, "....then
who?"</p>

<p>"I know that she loves you," Roz replied, "she just needs some time to
think... she is confused."</p>

<p>"What is there to think about??" Niles asked in disbelief, "I KNOW that we
are meant to be together.  I-I mean, how can she not see that??"</p>

<p>"She does..." Roz answered softly, "..she just needs time."</p>

<p>"I've waited SEVEN years." Niles said sadly, "Seven years of my life was
spent dreaming of her.  I NEVER lost hope.  I should be holding her in my
arms right now.  I-I should be the one who is going to be there through
EVERYTHING for the rest of her life... it should be me."</p>

<p>"It will be." Roz insisted.  Niles laughed sadly.</p>

<p>"Yeah," he replied in disbelief, "that's why she told me that she couldn't
be with me and to go away?"</p>

<p>"How would YOU be reacting, Niles??" Roz asked in defense of her friend,
"Look at this: the one person who has been there for you in every situation
for seven years who you put all of your trust into, and you just find out
that they are in love with you.  You are engaged to be married in TWO WEEKS,
but discover that you don't truly love your fiancee, you love your friend...
come on, Niles.  You are an intelligent man... what DOESN'T Daphne have to
deal with?  She's not just going to jump right into things... that would
just ruin everything." Niles just sat there thinking about everything.  He
knew that Roz was right, but how would he possibly pursue things with Daphne
without rushing her?</p>

<p>"Yeah, but... how am I going to just leave it alone for a while..?" Niles
asked quietly, "what if she just forgets about it??  What if it just grows
old... what if she meets someone else.. what if sh--" Roz cut him off.</p>

<p>"What if you just give her the time she needs right now to figure everything
out?" Roz asked him, "Don't think like that, this is Daphne we're talking
about..."  Niles nodded.</p>

<p>"OK, I'll give her some time..." he said quietly.</p>

<p>It had been one week since the whole situation with Daphne.  Niles hadn't
spoken to her since; he was terrified of ruining any chances that he had
with her.  He had, however, brought Frasier up to date with what was going
on.  Frasier, at first had been very upset at Niles for his actions, then
cooled off a little after learning it was he who originally had informed
Daphne of Niles' true feelings.  He was still upset that the wedding had
been canceled, but Niles insisted that it had nothing to do with him, it
was all Daphne's doings on behalf of discovering her true feelings.  Frasier
told him that Daphne had been kept to her room in the past week, coming out
only to help Martin with his exercises or to eat some food.  Niles knew
that he had to talk to her - soon.</p>

<p>Three days later, Niles was AGAIN thinking of Daphne and what he was going
to do when he spotted her inside of Cafe Nervosa, drinking a cup of tea to
herself.  He took a deep breath, and went inside.  He approached her, she
had her back turned to him.  He cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"Daphne?" He asked quietly.  She stopped instantly at what she was doing,
and turned to face him, obviously nervous.</p>

<p>"Oh, hello Dr. Crane." she replied softly.  Niles held his hand up.</p>

<p>"Really, I think now it is really safe for you to call me Niles....I-I would
just feel awkward if you didn't."</p>

<p>"OK," was all she replied.  Niles felt extremely nervous and was preparing
to get his heartbroken yet again.</p>

<p>"Uhm, may I join you?" he asked, nervously motioning towards the empty chair
that stood across from her.</p>

<p>"Be my guest," she replied.  He slowly sat down and looked at her.  She
avoided eye contact with him, paying attention to her stirring spoon that
lay beside her tea cup.</p>

<p>"So, how have you been?" Niles asked, not knowing what else to say.  Daphne
shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"I've been all right, I suppose... given the circumstances...."</p>

<p>"Oh, right," Niles replied sympathetically, "I heard about what happened
with Donny... I'm sorry to hear that." He honestly meant that in a sincere
way; anyone who intends to get married and have it suddenly not work out is
someone Niles would give sympathy to - even if it was Daphne's intended
marriage with another man.</p>

<p>"Not as sorry as you are happy though, right?" Daphne asked, still looking
down at her stir spoon.  Niles looked at her.</p>

<p>"N-no," he began, confused as to what was happening here, "all I could ever
ask for is that you be happy, Daphne..." He felt his heart pounding in his
chest; Daphne didn't seem pleased with him at all.</p>

<p>"I, I'm sorry," Daphne told him, "I just don't know what to think about
things right now." Niles nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Well, take your time, Daphne..." he told her, "I will wait for you, no
matter how long it takes, I'll be right here." Daphne didn't move at all,
she didn't seem to give a positive acknowledgment to what he had just said.</p>

<p>"That's sweet of you," was her flat reply.  Niles looked down at his hands,
then back up at her; who, was still avoiding all eye contact with him.</p>

<p>"Daphne?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes?" she replied.  He took a deep breath.</p>

<p>"What's going on between us?" he asked her.  He noticed that she had stopped
fiddling with her stir spoon, but still didn't look up to meet his eyes.
She didn't reply.  Niles didn't know what to think of this, so he decided to
keep talking, "You obviously know how I feel about you... How-- I mean, what
is it that you feel back for me?  Is there ANYTHING?  Anything at all...?"
It felt like ages until she finally replied.</p>

<p>"I do, but I just don't know what to think about it right now..." she told
him.  He nodded his head.</p>

<p>"Can you at least just answer me one question?" he asked her.  She slowly
looked up at him, making eye contact for the first time.  His blue, hurt
eyes looked so aching and desperate for her.  They looked watery, as though
he was on the verge of tears.</p>

<p>"What is that...?" she replied.</p>

<p>"Are you ever going to give me a chance?" he asked quickly, shaking his head
while he did so.  She looked into his eyes.  He looked so heartbroken, and
it was all because of her.  She had made him like this, and yet he still
wasn't giving up any hope in her; he told her that he would wait for her.
He told her that AFTER she had done what she did to him.  He was still
there, still ready to take that chance of it all happening again, just so he
could be with her.  She suddenly only realised now, that THIS was her fairy
tale love that she wanted.  THIS was the man who would die to just kiss her
once.</p>

<p>"I think I would be very stupid not to," she answered quietly.  Niles felt
his heart jump; seven years of dreaming was finally going to come true.  The
only thing he wanted to do right then was to pull her into his arms and
never let her go.  But he couldn't do that, not yet.  Instead, he smiled
softly and stared into her eyes.  Daphne stared back into his, realizing
through his gaze how much he actually loved her.  She felt his hand softly
glide over her fingers.</p>

<p>"What did I ever do that was so magnificent as to where I'm going to be the
luckiest man in history and be able to hold you in my arms??" he asked her,
tears of joy building in his eyes.  He smiled at her.  She was beautiful,
and she was more than worth that heartbreaking wait he had to go through.
She looked down nervously.</p>

<p>"I don't know..." she said awkwardly; it was odd having Niles speak to her
this way.  She was always convinced that the only woman he would ever go for
would be the high class society type - most definitely not her.  He thought
it would always be someone like Maris, or Mel.  Mel.  She cleared her
throat, "Uhm, what about Mel?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"Well, uhm, I broke up with her that night..." Niles said quietly, reliving
the day after when he cried hopelessly and desperately at her door, begging
for just a chance.  That had been the worst day of his life; even though it
had begun as one of his best.  What had that been about, anyways?  Why did
she suddenly just change her mind on him?</p>

<p>"Oh." Daphne replied, also thinking of what happened the following day.  How
she broke his heart.  Niles looked down, and began to fidget with a napkin.</p>

<p>"Uhm, Daphne?" he asked quietly.  Her reply was looking up at him.  "Uhm,
what happened that day?  Why did you tell me that you couldn't be with me?"
It was his turn to look down and not make eye contact.  He suddenly looked
very hurt and heartbroken again - not that Daphne blamed him.  She stared at
him, feeling completely awful.  This had to be very hard for him to talk
about.</p>

<p>"I..I was so confused at everything," she told him, "I mean, ever since I
found out about your feelings for me I haven't known what to think about
anything.  After we kissed, and I brought Donny into my room, my original
intention was to break up with him.  I just couldn't muster the guts, and I
felt I couldn't because we had already come so far.  We were to be married.
I just haven't known what to think about anything.. what I want or
anything..." she noticed as she said this, that he swallowed heavily and
closed his eyes for a moment.  What she just said obviously confused and
hurt him more.  She placed her hand over his, "...that is, I haven't known
until now, Niles."  He slowly looked up at her and stared at her.  He vowed
that from this day forward he would never let anybody else hurt her.  She
smiled softly.</p>

<p>"You have no idea how much I love you..." he said to her, "...I wish I could
put it into words, but that would be impossible.  Th-there aren't any words
to describe how perfect you are, or how amazing you actually make me feel...
the only thing I can say is that I really am in love with you and I will be
until the day I die -- no matter what happens."  He looked into her eyes
which were forming tears of joy in them.  He smiled shyly.</p>

<p>"No one has ever said ANYTHING like that to me EVER." she told him.  He
stared at her.  She was perfect and he truly loved her with all of his
heart.  He would die for her in a second.</p>

<p>"Daphne?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"May I kiss you?"  She smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied.  He slowly stood up and walked over to her side of the
table, and offered his hand for her. She slowly took it, and looked up into
his eyes, her heart pounding.  He slowly pulled her from her chair, and
placed his arms around her.</p>

<p>"You're perfect." He told her, and slowly moved his lips to hers.  She
wrapped his arms around his neck and kissed him back.
So are you, she thought...</p>
