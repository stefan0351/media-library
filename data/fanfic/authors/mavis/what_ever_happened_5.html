<!-- What Ever Happened To \ Part Five -->

<p>Holly smiled as Whitney fumbled to open the door. She'd been attracted to this woman back when she was a girl. The attraction she felt this evening was overwhelming in comparison. They entered the hotel room. After some idle chatter, they found themselves sitting on the bed, having removed their shoes.</p>
		<p>Holly was beyond nervous and her palms were beginning to sweat. She tried hard to fight off the feeling of desire. But all she could think about was how much she wanted to kiss this woman. "Whitney?" she began tentatively.</p>
		<p>"Hmm?" the brunette responded as she stretched out beside her.</p>
		<p>Holly inhaled sharply as she looked down at this beautiful woman clad in a simple pair of blue jeans and a white T-shirt. "I was wondering if there was someone waiting for you back in the city?" she finally gathered up enough courage to ask.</p>
		<p>"No," Whitney answered with a knowing smile. "I've been single for a couple of yearsnow. And you?"</p>
		<p>"My last relationship ended over seven months ago," Holly offered eagerly. "I have a confession to make," Holly began as she stared at Whitney's full lips. At that moment Whitney's tongue darted out, wetting her lips. "I . . . uhm." She sighed as she lay down next to Whitney. "I had a huge crush on you in high school."</p>
		<p>"Really?" Whitney smiled as her fingers began a tantalizing trail along Holly's arm. "Wow." She laughed.</p>
		<p>"What?" Holly encouraged her as she placed her hand on Whitney's hip. Her fingers began stroking the material under her hand.</p>
		<p>"It's just that I had a big crush on you as well," Whitney confessed with a blush.</p>
		<p>Holly's body heat rose as Whitney leaned closer to her. Holly's body leaned in as well. After all these years, she wouldn't deny this woman. Their faces were a breath apart as their legs wrapped around one another. Holly's nipples hardened as they brushed against Whitney's body. Their lips met shyly.</p>
		<p>The shyness quickly vanished as Holly wrapped her fingers in Whitney's long silky hair. Pulling her closer, Holly parted the taller woman's lips with her tongue as her body pressed urgently into Whitney's. She moaned as their tongues danced together. Holly needed to feel more of Whitney's body. She ran her hands down the strong back. She found herself tugging Whitney's shirt out of her jeans.</p>
		<p>Surprised by her own boldness, she slipped her hands up under the cotton material. Her fingers felt the warm exposed body. She rolled Whitney onto her back and pressed her thigh into the taller woman's center. Whitney moaned beneath her as she rubbed herself into her body. Holly could feel her wetness growing as she pulled Whitney's shirt up further.</p>
		<p>Annoyed that the shirt wouldn't travel any further, she broke the sensual kiss. Staring down at the woman beneath her, she rocked her hips against her as she removed her shirt and then her bra. She gasped at the sight of Whitney's half-naked body. Lowering her head, her tongue began to trace the curve of Whitney's full breast. She continued her exploration as she felt her own top being pulled up. Her hips increased their rhythm as she licked the valley between Whitney's breasts.</p>
		<p>She whimpered as Whitney pushed her away slightly. Knowing hands removed her top and bra as Holly pressed herself into Whitney's body. She groaned as Whitney captured her nipples between her fingers and pinched and rolled them. One hand slid down her firm abdomen and unbuttoned her pants. Holly was aflame with desire as she allowed Whitney to pull her pants and underwear down to her thighs.</p>
		<p>"God, you are so wet," Whitney moaned from beneath her as Holly pressed her center against her stomach. Holly ground against Whitney's firm body as she once again lowered her mouth to her breast. This time she captured Whitney's erect nipple in her mouth. "I want you," Holly murmured against her skin as she felt Whitney's fingers tease her slick folds.</p>
		<p>Whitney's body arched beneath her as Holly suckled her greedily, moving from one breast to the other and then back again. Whitney's thumb began to stroke her throbbing clit, Holly's body arched in response. Her hips thrust as she leaned over her lover. Whitney's face reflected her desire as Holly unzipped her jeans. Whitney continued to tease her swollen nub as Holly lowered her pants and underwear. Holly could smell her desire filling her.</p>
		<p>Holly's fingers dipped into Whitney's wetness. Their bodies rocked in unison as Holly ran her fingers along Whitney's swollen lips. "We need to slow down or I'm going to explode right now," she panted. Whitney nodded in agreement as they both took a moment to catch their breath. "I've never been so turned on in my life," Whitney confessed to her with a slight whimper as Holly lowered herself.</p>
		<p>Lying side by side, they kissed gently as their hands cupped and teased each other's breasts. Holly raised herself slightly and kissed Whitney's long graceful neck. Her tongue circled her ear. She heard her lover moan as she nibbled on her earlobe. Then she continued to kiss her jaw as her hands moved, caressing her ribs and down to the curve of her hip. Holly whimpered as she felt Whitney's tongue flicker across her nipple, circling it as Holly cupped her backside.</p>
		<p>Holly arched as Whitney began to suckle her nipple. Running her fingers back up Whitney's long body, she cupped her breast and began to tease the sweet rose-colored bud with her fingers. She could feel the tender panting against her skin as they continued to tease one another. Holly's body was on fire as they both began to rock against each other.</p>
		<p>They broke away slightly. Holly lowered herself once again as their lips met in a searing kiss. Tongues danced as they fought for control, while exploring the warmth of one another's mouth. They were gasping as the kiss ended, staring deeply into each other's eyes. Holly knew what they both wanted, but the need was too great. Quickly they shed the remainder of their clothing.</p>
		<p>Their naked bodies quickly reunited. Once again lying side by side, locked in a passionate kiss, they pressed their firm thighs into one another's center. Bodies rocked together as hands explored. The need to breathe overwhelmed them. Holly eagerly opened herself as Whitney's fingers dipped into her wetness. Her own hand was mirroring Whitney's actions. They moaned in unison at the wetness they discovered.</p>
		<p>Both women melted together as they entered each other's center. Their thumbs circled clits as their fingers plunged in and out. Clinging to each other, their bodies were covered in a sheen of sweat as their pace grew steadily wilder. Holly's thighs trembled as her body tightened around Whitney's fingers. Urged on by Whitney's body joining hers, she suckled Whitney's neck, nipping and licking.</p>
		<p>Holly's head fell back as her body arched. They climaxed in unison, calling out so loudly they must have woke everyone else in the hotel. They clung to each other tightly as the waves of passion flowed. As the waves ebbed, they extricated themselves from each other. "Wow," Whitney gasped. Holly chuckled in response, not capable of speaking yet. "Do you know that you just made a dream come true?"</p>
		<p>Holly leaned over and kissed her gently. "Tell me about your other dreams," she said. Whitney's eyes darkened with desire as she kissed Holly deeply before rolling her onto her back. "Well . . . ," Whitney purred deeply as she straddled her. Holly could feel her pulse soar as she pulled Whitney's body onto her own.</p>
