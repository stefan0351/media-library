<!-- Il Loro: Il Bruciando Ballo, Il Ballo Burrascoso \ Act III: A friend indeed -->

<p><b>Scene 1: Innocence Lost</b></p>

		<p>It just isn't as fun as it used to be.  I sit and watch my friend walk away and again I wonder why I'm not allowed to do or say anything.  It's been a month already but she's still not herself.  I wonder if she ever will be again.  Sure, she still comes and meets me for Kadis-Kot twice a week, but she just plays automatically.  I've even won more often than usual.  She doesn't even try to challenge me on my science studies anymore.</p>

		<p>It all changed the night of the Captain's Ball.  Personally, I thought that the way she and Lieutenant Torres danced was the most romantic thing that had ever happened on Voyager...  well, that I had seen.  I really didn't understand what happened at the end.  Why did they get mad at each other?</p>

		<p>I tried to talk to my mom about it, even Neelix, but both of them told me I shouldn't talk about it with anyone... especially Seven.  I couldn't figure out why and really neither of them gave me a real good reason.  Mom actually told me that I would probably hurt Seven if I tried to talk about it with her.  Since I didn't want to hurt my friend I did as she said.  But it feels rotten.  I miss how it used to be.</p>

		<p>"Hey, what's wrong squirt?" Lieutenant Torres asks me as she sits down at my table.  I guess I was too lost in thought to see her coming this way.</p>

		<p>"Nothing," I answer quietly.  It really is lousy to not be able to say anything.</p>

		<p>"Hmmm," the Lieutenant says thoughtfully.</p>

		<p>I don't like lying to her.  She's the only other person on the ship that has a different forehead like I do.  I always thought that was cool.  Besides, she is nice to me... and one time she spent a month teaching me about basic starship mechanics.  She made it fun too.</p>

		<p>"You know, I've been sad enough times to know when someone else is sad kiddo.  I also know it helps to talk about it.  So, I really wish you wouldn't tell me nothing is wrong." The Lieutenant says to me.</p>

		<p>Boy, she's making it hard.  I wonder if I should just tell her.  Mom said talking to Seven would hurt Seven.  But she didn't say talking to B'Elanna would hurt anyone.</p>

		<p>"Well," I say slowly, "there is something.  But I don't want to hurt anyone by talking about it."</p>

		<p>"Well, I doubt you'll hurt anyone squirt," she answers me with a smile.  "Go ahead and try me.  Let's see if we can make you feel better."</p>

		<p>I nod at her and try to figure out how to say it.  "Somebody I love is hurt and I don't know what to do.  I really want to make her feel better."</p>

		<p>"That's too bad.  I bet we can figure out a way to tell her you care though.  That always helps.  Do you know why she is hurting?" she asks me then finishes off her sandwich.</p>

		<p>"Oh yeah," I answer.  Maybe this won't be so hard I think.  "I'm pretty sure she's heartbroken.  She hasn't acted the same for a while."</p>

		<p>"That is hard.  I mean, being heartbroken.  Did someone breakup with her?" she asks me.</p>

		<p>"No," I say.  Well, maybe this is harder than I thought.  I think about it some more then decide it would be best if I just said it directly.  I take a deep breath.  "Seven hasn't been the same since you danced with her Lieutenant."  I say finally, looking down at the table.  I hope she doesn't get mad at me.</p>

		<p>It gets real quiet for a long time and I'm thinking maybe I should have done what mom said.  Boy, mom's gonna be mad when she hears about this.</p>

		<p>"Look, Naomi," the lieutenant says at last.  I look up at her because I hope she's going to tell me how to fix it.  "That dance between me and Seven was nothing.  I'm sure that's not what's bothering her if she's upset.  But maybe you ought to just ask her what's on her mind so at least she'll know you care.  I'm sure she'll be back to normal soon though."</p>

		<p>I look back down at the table.  I don't believe it at all.  Adults are weird.  It's the first time in two years that I feel like going to talk to Flotter in the holodeck.  I thought I had outgrown him.  But none of these adults are making me feel any better anyway.  At least he's just a program.</p>

		<p>"Okay, Lieutenant. Thanks."  I say.  Mom will be even madder if I don't say thank you.</p>

		<p>"No problem kiddo," she says, but I can tell she's not as happy as when she sat down with me.  "I hope you feel a little better.  I've got to head back to engineering now, but you can come talk to me anytime you want."</p>

		<p>I nod at her.  I'm still facing the table.  I really don't feel any better, but I don't want to talk about it anymore.</p>

		<p>
			<b>Scene 2: Lost love's truths.</b>
		</p>

		<p>Let me tell you, I am a happy man.  I've got the next two days off and so does my girlfriend.  My shift was over five minutes ago, when I turned in some navigational reports to Astrometrics.  It was an odd end to my workweek.  I mean, yeah, I turn in reports to Seven all the time, but I usually don't catch her crying at her console.  She's not even good at trying to hide it like most women I've known.  That was a little bizarre, but I really don't know what I can do, except maybe mention it to the Captain.</p>

		<p>Anyway, what was I saying?  Oh yeah.  I am so very, very happy to be heading to the holodeck where I have four straight hours with Susan.  I really enjoy time with Susan.  Go figure: I'm dating another engineer.  Some people think I should have had enough of engineering women after B'Elanna, but really, my marriage wasn't so bad.  It just wasn't so good.</p>

		<p>B'Elanna and I dated so long that it felt right to propose to her.  Like it was time to settle in and enjoy the benefits of never having to sleep apart.  Well, we soon found out that the benefits weren't really there.  I thought B'Elanna would be able to enjoy my many interesting ideas in the bedroom.  She thought I would be charming and romantic once we 'settled down'.   I thought she understood that my twentieth century memorabilia was something I would want to display in the living room.  She thought I'd outgrow it.  I thought she was really uptight.  She thought I was a slob.  And this was only 15 days into the marriage.  By the end of the third week, we had a bad fight and said some really nasty things to each other.   Almost immediately, I felt awful and really it was obvious that she did too.  So we decided that that we should go ahead and end it while we still loved each other as friends.  Or there might be a death... and knowing her Klingon weapon collection, I thought it might be mine.  The Captain was surprised, but annulled us the same day we asked.  It took a week to get me another cabin, since mine had been taken, but we found out in that time that our friendship was much more fun than our romance.</p>

		<p>So, I've dated a few women.  Mostly all the good-looking women; I really had thought they would make me happy.  B'Elanna hasn't dated anyone to my knowledge.  Yet, the hot-babes and I never made a bang either.  It wasn't until B'Elanna told me she was setting me up on a blind date that I had a good date.  Yeah, blind date on Voyager... funny isn't it?  She just knew I was too pigheaded (well... she actually said I was a pig) to ask out someone who wasn't an obvious babe.  That was a few months back and I have been with Susan ever since.  Let me tell you man, she may not be as easy on the eyes as someone like Seven or a Delaney, but she isn't ugly... and most importantly: she is a blast!  We have had so much fun.</p>

		<p>I enter my pass code into the holodeck doors as I finally get here.  Inside is my surprise.  I smile.  Susan is a great holo-programmer too... did I mention that?  She must have remembered me saying how much I love snow skiing, because I just walked into a chalet overlooking some wonderful white powder.  It takes me a second to see her lying on the bearskin rug next to a roaring fire... waiting for me.  I just love time off.  I go over to her and... properly greet her.</p>

		<p>After an hour or so, we've had some fun, good wine and dinner.  Now we are climbing into some holo-provided ski-gear to go tackle the slopes.  I adore this woman.  We're talking about our days, sharing the hassles and laughing at whatever there is to laugh about.  I was telling her about the joke Captain Janeway made on the bridge before I took the reports to Seven and it reminded me of how odd it was to see Seven crying.</p>

		<p>"You know Suz," I say, "I did have one bad experience on the way here.  As I dropped off my nav-reports to Astrometrics, I found Seven crying."  Susan turns and gives me an odd look but she appears to want to hear more, so I continue.  "It was uncomfortable.  I don't know her well enough to comfort her while she cries and she didn't look like she wanted it anyway."</p>

		<p>"It's really no wonder that she was upset Tom," Susan says, fairly cryptically.  She doesn't continue either.  She just laces her other boot like she hadn't said anything.  I finally squat down in front of her and give her my full attention so she knows I want to hear the rest.  She sighs and gets that little quirky dimple she gets when something has upset her.  "Well, Lieutenant Torres ripped her a new one for no reason today in Engineering.  I mean Seven only came to hand in some upgrade ideas that Janeway wanted the chief to look at, but B'Elanna really went off on her.  Basically told her to stay the hell away from her... with her," she inhales and does her best B'Elanna impression, "'filthy lying Borg hands.' And that she 'didn't need a heartless drone to tell her how to do things.'  Poor Seven was shaking as she left.  Most of us just gave the chief a wide berth the rest of the day, cuz it was almost over."</p>

		<p>I knew that was probably hard for Susan to say.  She tries to never criticize B'Elanna in front of me, because she knows I love B'Elanna in a way and always will.  Susan also keeps saying she owes us being together 'to the chief' and apparently that means a lot to her.  I try to think of why B'Elanna would act like that for no reason and can't really come up with much.  Then again B'Elanna has been acting a little off for a few weeks, so I don't know.</p>

		<p>"Maybe I should talk to B'Elanna soon," I say thoughtfully.  Susan has a shocked look, so I grin at her... no sense in getting this serious right now... it is our holodeck time and we do have snow to plow you know.</p>

		<p>"But right now, you are the only woman I want to think about.  Come on."  I give her my best smile and wiggle my eyebrows... she always laughs when I do that.</p>

		<p>The next morning, after breakfast in bed with Susan, I ask her if she would mind me going to take care of a couple of things.  She's so sweet about wanting to take care of me that it's a bit hard to want to go.  However, she has no problem letting me go, no questions asked.  It's scary that she trusts me so much.  Even if I spent half the day in B'Elanna's quarters she wouldn't doubt me.  I never want to screw that up.  I get all caught up in kissing her at the door, and finally she pushes me towards it.</p>

		<p>"If you want to leave you better go now fly-boy.  Or else I might drag you back to bed," she smiles.  That is a very hard offer to leave, but I want to get this off of my mind sooner rather than later.  It's bugging me.  I bow dramatically and exit.</p>

		<p>It only takes a minute and I'm in Engineering.  It's nearly time for a lunch break for B'Elanna, so I track her down and convince her that I need to talk in private about something serious.  She slams down her spanner and looks at me hard.</p>

		<p>"You haven't screwed up with Susan already have you?" she asks me and I laugh.  'So wrong Lanna' I think.  I convince her otherwise and finally she just agrees to go eat with me.</p>

		<p>We had this little picnic place when we dated.  It was strange but sort of fun.  Down on Deck 15 there are a few junction rooms that hardly anyone uses.  As long as we clean up after ourselves, we can pretty much do anything there.  It's been 'our' spot... when we dated... when we divorced... whenever we need to talk.  I can't figure out why more people don't use these junction rooms when this ship has such a lack of privacy.  So we arrive and she looks at me as if to ask what I wanted to talk about and I decide to plow right into it.  It's easier that way.</p>

		<p>"B'Elanna... You are being a major jackass," I say flatly.  She looks like she is about to explode on me so I hold both my hands up asking her to hear me out.  "I've known something was up with you for a while, but it took me until last night to really figure out what it is."</p>

		<p>"What the hell are you talking about Tom?"  She growls at me.</p>

		<p>"Why you've been acting this way.  You're grumpy all the time, easier to anger, and you've been pouring yourself into your work all the time.  For weeks your attitude has degraded," I say.  "I probably would have taken longer connecting it except the details finally hit me hard in the face yesterday."</p>

		<p>She's really glaring at me now and I really should speed this up, but I know her well enough to know to take it slow, no matter the possible bodily harm.</p>

		<p>"You are in love," I state emphatically.  She looks at me like I have two heads now.  That's better than the glare though.  Here's the fun part.  "With Seven of Nine."</p>

		<p>"What?" She screams at me and looks like she wants to punch me.  I know I'm right, because if I were wrong she'd just laugh... not this wanting to rip my head off thing.</p>

		<p>"You heard me.  You're in love with Seven.  I thought there was something there the night of the ball, but everyone told me to leave you alone.  Now I know they were wrong to do that.  I should have bugged you from the start and maybe you wouldn't have spent the last month tearing the poor woman's heart in two."  I tell her.  "You know I found her crying like a baby on duty yesterday?  Susan told me you had just torn her in half for no reason in front of your whole staff.  I asked Carey what he saw, and he agreed.  He said that Seven hadn't even said two words to you before you were quite cruel to her.  That's just not like you B'Elanna... except that it's just like you.  You run away from love... strong emotions scare you, especially love."</p>

		<p>"I've always screamed at Seven.  You know she drives me nuts.  That superior smug ice-cold behavior has always made me crazy!"  She has gotten up and begun to pace.  It's a small space so she can't go far.  "Tom, how many fights have Seven and I had over the years?  Why do you all of the sudden think I'm in love with her?  It's ridiculous!"</p>

		<p>"There are several reasons Lanna, but I'll start with the fighting.  You've never been flat-out abusive to her before... she always said or did something to make you mad before this, but everyone I've talked to has agreed.  You've been unusually mean to her since the Ball... and getting worse."  I pause and let that sink in.  She's grumbling now as she paces.  That means she is thinking about it.  "Then there's the whole Klingon anger means I love you thing.  You wanted to smash my head in before we dated.  You hate your Klingon side sometimes, but it's as much a part of you as the Borg part of Seven.  You're both hybrids of two races you know."  She stops and glares at me for a second then resumes pacing.  "One last thing I want to point out... one of the things I never gave you was romance.  Seven sure did romance the hell out of you... in front of everyone.  And you were loving it, you don't just kiss people B'Elanna, and she certainly didn't force you.  You two were amazing that night... it was stunning.  Nobody understood any of it, and neither of you cared to explain it, so most people think it's over."  I stand up and dust off my pants.  "I think it has just begun.  You don't fool me as well as you are fooling yourself Lanna."</p>

		<p>I wait to see if she wants to say anything else, but she is exquisitely silent in her pacing and will not give me eye contact.  So I decide to leave, but first I say my last piece.  "I love you Lanna.  You're one of my best friends.  So I'll be here for you.  But you really needed to know... you're being a real jackass."</p>

		<p>Now I can leave her.  I doubt she will come up for a while.  I hope she gets it sooner than later.  They both deserve love.  Hell... they deserve each other.</p>
