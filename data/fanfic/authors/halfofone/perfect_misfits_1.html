<!-- Perfect Misfits \ 1. Crash Landing -->

<p>B'Elanna Torres, Chief Engineer of the Federation starship Voyager, opened her eyes, groaned with pain and closed them again as she remembered where she was, in a crash pod, somewhere on a no name planet that she and a small shuttle team had been surveying for minerals.</p>
		<p>Another shuttle lost.  Oh ye gods the Captain was not going to be pleased.  If she was lucky Voyager might be able to salvage the wreck, if not then the chief engineer faced long tedious hours building a replacement.  And suffering from the Captain's disapproval at the waste of resources.</p>
		<p>That was the future, for now she needed to get out of the damned pod find the others and try and survive whatever the planet could throw at them until Voyager arrived.  She checked the pod's sensors and was relieved that the environment outside was acceptable.  The sensors detected signs of other crash pods but at some distance.  She tapped her communicator but got no response.  The damn thing was not working. She would have to find them the hard way.</p>
		<p>Cursing her misbegotten half-caste luck Torres pushed open the escape hatch of the crash pod and immediately regretted it as a wall of heat and moisture and light and noise fell on her head.
			<i>This is no place for a Klingon with a hangover</i>.   The noise of insects and birds in the towering trees echoed in her aching skull as she crawled head first into the sunlight and got to her feet.
		</p>
		<p>Looking round at her surroundings she noticed three things.</p>
		<p>Firstly she seemed to have crash landed on someone's house,  broken pots and a table and the greater part of the roof  lay on the ground around the pod.
			<i>Well dammit it is more a hut than a house and at least it was empty when I landed.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Secondly, the huge atmospheric storm that had put them in this situation had evaporated as quickly as it arrived and strong light from the planet's main sun was flooding the room through the hole in the roof.</p>
		<p>Thirdly. entering the front door of the hut and rising up against the light to look at the cause of the disturbance was a large yellow and black snake.  Actually to say it was large was an understatement, like saying the Borg are unfriendly.  This snake was enormous.</p>
		<p>Torres reached for her phaser and found, without any surprise as it had been that kind of day, nothing.</p>
		<p>A pair of red eyes peered at her and perhaps puzzled at what it saw the reptile must have asked for a second opinion for a moment later another similar head, this time with yellow eyes, appeared through the door and loomed over her.
			<i>Oh great! Twice the fun.</i>  Easing backward she tried to inch her way towards a large spear she could see lying on the ground two paces to her right when a calm voice calling from outside the hut made her jump.
		</p>
		<p>"Lieutenant Torres please report your location?  What is your functional status?".  The voice then added somewhat unnecessarily.  "Lieutenant Torres this is Seven of Nine".</p>
		<p>Both snakes twisted toward the sound and B'Elanna took her chance to dive sideways to the spear landing painfully hard on her side. Grunting she rolled away and up on her feet, to find the open maw of the red-eyed snake at arms length from her face and approaching rapidly.  B'Elanna shoved the spear deep into it's throat with every ounce of strength at her disposal.</p>
		<p>"Swallow that and get some sleep red-eye" she screamed beginning to enjoy herself as only a Klingon can when engaged in a life and death struggle with a giant snake.</p>
		<p>The animal's head snapped up and writhed away taking the spear along with it and the second snake reared towards her.</p>
		<p>"Oh shit - the cavalry".  Torres jumped over the table and crouched down between the table and the wall as the snake struck,  missing her by a hands breadth.  High above her head, hanging on the wall, she could see a large battle-axe but to reach it she would have to stand up right under the beast's nose.</p>
		<p>Before she could solve that problem Seven of Nine appeared through a side entrance close to the table.  The snake lunged at this new target.  Seven yelped, fired her phaser and missed.  She fell back against the table and lay motionless on the floor.  The snake opened it's jaws and prepared to swallow the fallen Borg.  Torres leapt on the table and grabbed the axe off the wall. Praying that the blade was sharp she swung at the neck of the beast.  The stroke, delivered with perfect force and a loud Klingon curse, severed the head from the snake's body.  It flew across the room and landed by the door.  The yellow eyes blinked once and then fell open.  B'Elanna nearly laughed as the severed head lay looking at her in apparent astonishment.</p>
		<p>The engineer dropped to her feet beside Seven and felt for a pulse in Seven of Nine's neck.  As she touched her, Seven's ice blue eyes opened and gazed up at her.  The blue eyes softened momentarily and then opened wide with fear as they looked past her.  "B'Elanna behind you".  Spinning round B'Elanna realised that the remaining snake, still with the spear stuck in it's jaws, was thrashing towards her.  It proceeded to vomit a foul smelling green liquid over the disgusted engineer,  then screamed and fell back dead.</p>
		<p>Seven of Nine struggled upright and looked at the carnage in the hut and the filthy battered  Klingon and said in a neutral tone.  "I believe you have been enjoying yourself Lieutenant."  B'Elanna felt irritated by the implication that she had deliberately caused the current mess rather than simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
		<p>"Listen Borg everything was under control until you turned up!" She yelled untruthfully.  "And you might like to thank me for saving your scrawny butt."  Seven of Nine lifted an eyebrow but did not respond other than to pick up her tricorder and run it over the Lieutenant.  "You have a mild concussion Lieutenant, some bruises and cuts but otherwise you are undamaged.  The green substance would appear to be harmless although evil smelling,  it is probably a defence mechanism to discourage predators."</p>
		<p>B'Elanna looked worried "There might be creatures living here that regard Sammy the snake as lunch!"  Not really wanting to think about what such an animal might be like B'Elanna busied herself collecting her survival equipment from the pod including, she noted with satisfaction, a compression phaser rifle.  "Seven we need to find the others.."</p>
		<p>Seven interrupted her.  "I have established a base camp with ensigns Kominsky and Walthers 20 minutes walk from here.  Lieutenant Gerard is damaged but stable.  We should rejoin them quickly."</p>
		<p>B'Elanna wondered why she felt so irrationally irritated by the Borg's efficiency and calm assumption of authority.  "Seven I am in charge of this away mission and I don't want any confusion over who is giving orders."
			<i>Kahless but I sound like some Starfleet prig.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Seven did not seem upset and replied evenly "I understand the concept of the chain of command Lieutenant".  Which somehow annoyed Torres even more.  Sighing she picked up her pack and led the way out the door wrinkling her nose at the awful smell and then realising again that she was the source.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Outside the hut about twenty tall silent bipeds had gathered carrying spears, shields and knives.  For a few moments the aliens and the two Voyager crew members stood and looked at each other.  The aliens were humanoid, about 2.5 metres tall,  heavily built with dark complexions, completely black eyes and dense black fur down their arms and legs.  Their torsos were covered with lightly armoured jerkins.  The group included males and females.</p>
		<p>All hell broke loose as the aliens began gesticulating at the hut and cursing and shouting threats at the Voyager crewmen.  The crowd took a few threatening steps towards Torres and Seven of Nine.  Torres raised her rifle and shouted over the din.  "We are from the starship Voyager.  We mean you no harm."</p>
		<p>"Lieutenant it is unlikely these creatures know what a starship is and they have the evidence of your destruction of one of their homes to gauge our probable intent.  We should demonstrate our firepower rather than attempt to engage in futile introductions."</p>
		<p>Feeling foolish Torres agreed silently and fired her rifle over the heads of the angry group disintegrating part of a an overhanging shrub and there was immediate silence.  Then the members of the group raised their spears and their features contorted into what Torres thought might be grins.  She could have sworn that she heard one of them say.  "Today is a good day to die."</p>
		<p>"I think Borg that was the wrong approach.  Lay down fire in front of the group and keep them back and we'll try to make a run for the trees."  Seven of Nine nodded her agreement.  They started firing continuous bursts at the ground in front of the excited warriors while backing rapidly towards the edge of the forest.  The hairy aliens came after them dodging the phaser bursts.</p>
		<p>Their retreat was interrupted by a mighty bellow and an alien ran out from the ruined hut carrying the severed head of the snake.  He took it over to his fellows, shouting at them excitedly.   The others looked at him and lowered their spears.  A large fellow with heavy scarring on his face roared at Seven and Torres in a guttural voice.  "You did this?"
			<i>Oh gods don't tell me I've killed the family pet.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Torres replied as firmly as she could "Yes I killed the stinking beast."</p>
		<p>The big chap looked at her carefully and then wrinkling his nose replied "You do not smell so good yourself great warrior."  At this he started to laugh and a moment later all his compatriots also roared with laughter.  Torres lowered her weapon and shouted.  "I am glad that this amuses you scarface."  The aliens laughed even harder.</p>
		<p>The heavily scarred male spoke again "Tell me small one with the mighty arm,  why are you here and what is it that you want?  Do you seek battle and glory?  Or are you thieves and cut-throats without honour?"</p>
		<p>B'Elanna felt curiously familiar with this type of address and replied easily "We are travellers from the sky and we came to find rest and food on our travels.  We do not seek death but we would meet it with honour."</p>
		<p>The hairy alien thought about this for a moment and seemed to be satisfied.  "Then you are welcome to find rest here in my village.  This beast has killed my brethren and to kill such a beast single handed brings glory to the hunter.  We will have a feast to celebrate and the beast itself will provide the dinner.  We are Verroth".  He covered the ground between them and picked up B'Elanna in a big hug.  "Your friend is welcome also."</p>
		<p>Cheers and laughter could be heard and the aliens immediately began preparations by removing the bodies of the two snakes from the half demolished hut.  The Verroth were a noisy, rambunctious people laughing and quarrelling in equal measure.  A row soon broke out between those who wished to demolish the damaged house and those trying to rebuild it.  The resulting fight completed the demolition and resolved the argument.  B'Elanna found it rather funny and shouted encouragement to the combatants.</p>
		<p>Seven of Nine sighed gently "I believe Lieutenant that you have finally found a group of beings of a like mind to yourself."</p>
		<p>B'Elanna looked embarrassed.  Then remembering her responsibilities she continued  "I had better make arrangements with Scarface to collect the other members of the landing party.  If these people eat, drink and party like Klingons we are all going to need our strength tonight."</p>
		<p>She walked away to talk to Scarface leaving Seven of Nine wondering why she had volunteered to go on this trip.  Well, she knew why but she had not anticipated spending several days in the company of a troupe of hairy would be Klingons.</p>
		<p>"I will adapt" she said to herself.  And then her eyebrow lifted in the nearest approach the Borg had to a smile as she observed the small dark Klingon-Human hybrid slap the hulking Verroth on the back causing him to visibly wince.</p>
