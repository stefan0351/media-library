<!-- Perfect Misfits \ 2. A Cultural Misunderstanding -->

<p>Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres lay back happily and looked up at the stars. There were no familiar constellations but she was used to that after six years in the Delta quadrant. Her stomach was full, her team was safe and Torres felt content for the moment. Her brain was a little fuzzy and warm after drinking the local brew.  Seven had refused to touch it after scanning the pitchers placed in front of them at the feast but B'Elanna Torres was fairly confident that there would be few alcoholic brews she couldn't stomach, after all she was a Klingon, of a sort.</p>
		<p>Dimly she wondered what Tom was doing; they were probably worried up there on Voyager after they had lost contact with the shuttle.  The distress call should have reached them by now, and they would be pulling out the stops to find them, Kathryn Janeway hunting for her lost brood. Especially as the Captain's pet Borg was amongst the missing team. Torres looked over at Seven sitting quietly and neatly staring into the campfire and felt the familiar resentment at the Borg's perfect body, perfect face and air of superiority.</p>
		<p>Fuelled by the alcohol she started to speak her mind "I suppose Kathryn Janeway is in a panic now her little favourite is missing. I'm surprised the search parties haven't already arrived."</p>
		<p>Seven of Nine raised her head and stared at the pugnacious engineer "As you already know Lieutenant it will take several days for Voyager to reach us."  Seven looked away  "Why do you dislike me B'Elanna Torres?  Is it because I am Borg or is it my friendship with the Captain?"</p>
		<p>"Don't take it so seriously Seven, I am only teasing you and I don't dislike you.  Well, OK, I do find you a bit smug and superior and you sometimes irritate the hell out of me and I don't know why the Captain thinks that you should always get your own way on everything.  But apart from that, you and me, we're fine."  Her words slurred together.</p>
		<p>Seven shrugged her shoulders.  "You are inebriated Lieutenant, further conversation is unnecessary."  She stood up elegantly and went to check on Lieutenant Gerard whose injuries were fairly severe.  Her crash pod had been damaged on impact with the ground and the science officer had broken three ribs and her left leg.  Seven had arranged for the Verroth medical man to set the bones in Gerard's leg; a painful process that seemed to afford the Verroth much amusement.</p>
		<p>B'Elanna watched the beautiful Borg check the strapping and splints on Gerard's ribs and leg, it suddenly seemed very funny to the Klingon.  Seven as an angel of mercy.  B'Elanna drunkenly contemplated Limerick rhymes involving Seven but couldn't get beyond "There once was a young Borg called Seven who despaired she would get into Heaven".  Even drunk, B'Elanna could see that Seven was unlikely to share her amusement.</p>
		<p>As she continued her observations, a touch of desire trailed over her skin.  She pushed it aside.  It was not the first time. She had often watched the Borg moving purposefully about engineering or astrometrics, carrying out her work with that absolute concentration that she brought to everything.  Graceful, certain and arrogant, Seven made B'Elanna experience lust and annoyance almost in equal measure.  The engineer relieved her frustrations by insulting the Borg.</p>
		<p>B'Elanna sat up and swore.  Klingons don't have these sorts of feelings.  B'Elanna herself had always regarded same sex relations as a rather bizarre aberration and a weakness of lesser species.
			<i>But you are not a 'real' Klingon are you B'Elanna?</i> sneered her inner voice.
		</p>
		<p>And there was Tom.
			<i>Yeah what about Tom?</i> the voice jeered.
		</p>
		<p>In any case Seven adored the Captain, everyone knew that.</p>
		<p>B'Elanna Torres got unsteadily to her feet, perhaps she was a little worse for drink, maybe it was time to turn in.  "Kominsky you have the first watch, Walther you take the next and I'll take the third and Seven the fourth".</p>
		<p>Seven regarded her, "Lieutenant Torres as I do not require sleep it would be more efficient to assign me to all watches."</p>
		<p>B'Elanna could not hide her exasperation at having her orders questioned "I did not assign you to every watch because, Ms Smart Alec, I didn't ...."  At this point B'Elanna couldn't think of a reasonable, or even an unreasonable point.  "Because that's not how we do it,  you know, all's fair in love and war."  she said.  B'Elanna stopped realising that Seven was looking confused.</p>
		<p>Then her befuddled brain came to her rescue and she finished with a flourish  "and in any case, Seven, since you won't be able to regenerate until we are rescued, I suggest you try and learn to sleep."  With that the engineer staggered into the hut they had been assigned and fell fully clothed on to her bed.  She passed out almost immediately and dreamt of beheading blue eyed snakes that then reproached her for her cruelty.</p>
		<p>A while later B'Elanna was disturbed from sleep by shouting outside and Seven's raised voice "Take your hand off me or I will break your arm."  This was met by deep laughter and she then heard a Verroth growl "You are too pretty to hurt me little one."  Kominsky was trying to reason with the Verroth and getting short shrift and there followed noise of a scuffle.  Torres rolled out of bed and lurched upright and stubbed her foot, cursing the planet and its inhabitants in her best Klingon.</p>
		<p>The Verroth Doctor was hanging heavily on an angry Seven's arm with his arm draped round her shoulders. Kominsky was picking herself up off the ground several metres away.</p>
		<p>"What the fucking hell goes on here?  Take your hands off her you great hairy quack." yelled Torres furiously.  It was bad enough to be woken early with a hangover without the repellent sight of some stupid brute pawing Seven.  The medical man let go of Seven, pulled himself up to his full height and glared at B'Elanna Torres. Then a drunken, cunning smile slipped over his face.</p>
		<p>"The great warrior, she is your
			<b>hroth</b>.  My apologies pretty one."  He addressed these words to Seven of Nine.
		</p>
		<p>B'Elanna wondered yet again at the selective abilities of the Universal translator but decided that little harm could come from agreeing if it would get this over with quickly.  "Yes I am her hroth.  Now push off and let me get some sleep."</p>
		<p>His black eyes gleamed victoriously "I will leave now 'great warrior' but I challenge you for this woman.  I will see you at the second sunrise tomorrow."  He turned and left, staggering slightly as he walked.</p>
		<p>"Oh Kahless! What the hell have I done now." B'Elanna put her head in her hands and then looked up.  Seven of Nine was looking at her with definite amusement.  "It would seem that you are to fight for me 'great warrior'."</p>
		<p>Kominsky smirked and Torres promptly lost her temper again and snapped at her "Take your sorry butt out of my sight and go find Scarface.  I need to speak with him and try and sort this out." The hapless ensign jumped to attention and set off at the double.  Watching her go B'Elanna muttered to herself "What in Kahless' name is a
			<b>hroth</b> anyway?"
		</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Scarface laughed loudly when Torres explained the events of the night to him but he was quite unyielding about the outcome. It would seem that
			<b>hroth</b> roughly translated as some where between husband and master.  Torres would have to fight the amorous doctor or she would lose by default and he would be entitled to take Seven of Nine as his property.  It was normal Verroth custom to challenge other members of the tribe for their spouses/partners.  No amount of pleading that it was a genuine cultural misunderstanding carried any weight.  This was a matter of honour.  On the bright side Scarface had said it was unlikely that any other Verroth would challenge for Seven of Nine as in his opinion the doctor had very unusual taste in women.  Seven's expression at that point nearly made the whole fiasco worthwhile.
		</p>
		<p>"Well it seems I have to fight.  Has anyone discovered anything that might help me?" Torres asked her assembled crew.</p>
		<p>"We have asked several Verroth what is involved and none appear to be willing to enlighten us" replied Ensign Walther.  "I don't think they rate the medicine man as a warrior and they don't want to give you any help".  Walther was a quiet young scientist and the boisterous Verroth made him nervous.  Torres knew she needed to maintain the team morale.  "Well" she noted with a smile "I see where the home crowd support will be."</p>
		<p>"Well that isn't necessarily clear Lieutenant" replied Ensign Kominsky seriously.  "The odds being offered are in your favour.   I think the Verroth just want a good fight."</p>
		<p>"Are you telling me there is a book open?"  The two young ensigns nodded nervously at their chief.  "Good I shall place a bet on myself."</p>
		<p>"Is it a fight to the death?"  B'Elanna asked this as casually as she knew how not wanting the crew to detect any fear in her voice.</p>
		<p>Seven answered her question "Since Scarface said this was a normal of means settling ownership disputes it seems unlikely that the expected outcome is death.  However given the number of facial scars we have observed amongst male and female Verroth it seems possible that the degree of facial scarring determines the loser."</p>
		<p>Seven was trying to be reassuring but at that moment B'Elanna could have hit her.  Sensing from B'Elanna's expression that perhaps she was not very comforted Seven continued lamely.  "Voyager's doctor will be able to repair any scarring."  B'Elanna grimaced and ground her teeth.</p>
		<p>Seven said quietly.  "B'Elanna you do not need to do this."</p>
		<p>"Yes I do.  We have discussed the alternatives and they all suck.  If we run away we would have to survive in this jungle and it would be too dangerous, particularly with Gerard in no condition to travel.  If I default then you will have to handle the 'The Doctor of Love' and you will probably kill him leaving us back at scenario number one.  The Verroth would not approve of being murdered by their property.  No, the only way is for me to defeat the 'Love Doc' in honourable battle and have him leave us in peace."</p>
		<p>Trying to lighten the atmosphere B'Elanna commented "Remember I have to answer to Captain Kathryn 'Prime Directive' Janeway.  The Captain would not like us busting local laws and creating mayhem amongst law abiding aliens just to avoid being sliced and diced.  I am much more afraid of Janeway than any great hairy warrior"</p>
		<p>The crew laughed except Seven of Nine who stepped close to B'Elanna and cupping her face in one hand said in a low voice.  "Be careful wIj qa', I do not think I could bear to lose you."  She then walked out of the hut leaving behind one stunned Klingon.</p>
		<p>After a long moment B'Elanna glanced round at the other crewmen who were looking curiously after the Borg.  Lieutenant Gerard was sitting up, smirking, and said to the engineer "Well who would have guessed it Lieutenant, the Borg has a crush on you."</p>
		<p>B'Elanna recovered herself and responded with sarcasm "Jealous Gerard?  You like the girlies don't you,  perhaps you thought you had a chance?"</p>
		<p>"Even I draw the line at Borg Lieutenant."</p>
		<p>In that moment of rage B'Elanna Torres considered killing the woman and Gerard drew back with fear at the murder in the Klingon's eyes.  B'Elanna lifted the frightened woman by her collar "Listen to me daughter of fools and scoundrels, Borg or not, you are not fit to breathe the same air as Seven of Nine.  Speak of her again in such a manner and I will crush your skull with my bare hands."</p>
		<p>And then B'Elanna's rage evaporated in confusion and she dropped Gerard who shrank into the corner.  Not knowing what to say next B'Elanna made do by scowling at the subdued crewmen, silently daring them to make any further comment.  She went outside the hut and sat down on an upturned box and waited.  Two hours to second sunrise.  The Klingon consoled herself
			<i> Well at least I have improved the odds.  If I win then we get out of here in one piece.  If I lose then I avoid having to face Seven or any of my crew again.  A win/win situation.</i>
