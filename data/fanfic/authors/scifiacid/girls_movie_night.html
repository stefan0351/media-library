<p>Buffy adjusted her position on the couch slightly.
Wiggling her toes out from underneath the blanket she
had wrapped mummy like around her body. </p>

<p>It was the first of the girls-only Friday night
movie-athons. Buffy, Willow, Tara and Anya had
gathered together at the Summers’ home about an hour
ago and were in various stages of settling down for
the evening. Earlier in the day, before leaving on a
three-day trip to San Francisco, Joyce had been rather
adamant that Dawn also be included in the night’s
festivities, to which both siblings had immediately
objected. It took several hours of cajoling their
mother for her to finally relent and agree that Dawn
could spend one night, and one night only, at her
friend Melinda’s house. </p>

<p>Buffy had sighed in relief as they both helped their
mother finish packing. She was very much in need of
some time away from her constantly annoying kid
sister. Dawn, on the other hand, was equally as happy
that her mother had consented. Although, she loved
hanging out with Willow and Tara and talking about
witchstuff, unknown to either Buffy or Joyce,
Melinda’s older brother Todd was home from college for
a few days and Dawn had a little crush on him. So the
witch talk would have to wait for another night. </p>

<p>So the girls had packed their mother's stuff up and
practically pushed her out the door to the car. A few
hours later, Dawn was over at Melinda’s, and the
xx-chromosomed members of the Scooby gang where
settling down in the living room for their all-night
movie-athon. </p>

<p>"Where is she?" Anya said annoyed as she lay on her
stomach in the sleeping bag on the floor. She twisted
around to growl in Buffy's direction. "I want
popcorn!"</p>

<p>Buffy rolled her eyes, tossed off her blanket and got
up from the couch. She had sent Willow in to help Tara
get the popcorn when the blonde had stumbled back into
the living room 10 minutes ago, slightly embarrassed
by the fact that she didn't know where the popcorn
was. Like she should have known, even though she'd
never actually been in the Summers' kitchen before.
Buffy had poked Willow with her foot to go help, and
had settled back into the comfy couch. Obviously it
had been a bad decision to send Willow in to help
Tara.</p>

<p>So she dragged herself up off of the couch and headed
towards the kitchen. When she reached the doorframe,
she stopped abruptly. Looking back into the living
room, and then into the kitchen again, she thought
maybe it would be a good idea to quietly back away… </p>

<p>"Willow."</p>

<p>The sultry voice nailed Buffy to the floor. 'Umm,
maybe I'll just watch and make sure they find
everything okay.' She said trying to convince herself
that she was only going to watch the two witches for
purely selfless reasons. After all, someone had to
make sure they knew where the popcorn was kept. </p>

<p>Of course, the real reason she wanted to stay and
watch the two was more than her swirling mind wanted
to consider at the moment. Settling herself against
the right side of the doorframe and a little behind,
Buffy positioned herself so she had an unobstructed
view of the entire kitchen. </p>

<p>Tara was in the corner of the room, near the
microwave, bent over slightly as she leant against the
counter. Her arms rested against the cool titled
surface as she watched the microwave timer ticking
down, nuking the kernels inside. Willow, who had
reached up into a high cabinet next to Tara to grab
another box of popcorn, teetered momentarily before
placing a hand on the blonde’s back to steady herself.
Once she had retrieved the box, she set it down on the
counter, her hand remaining on Tara’s back. Buffy
watched as the redhead eased her hand downward in the
direction of a small bit of exposed flesh just above
her girlfriend’s skirt. Gently slipping her fingers
underneath. </p>

<p>"Willow!" Tara warned as she stood up knocking
Willow's hand away from her body. </p>

<p>"What?" Willow smiled innocently at her girlfriend, a
silly grin on her face.</p>

<p>Buffy had to clasp a hand over her mouth for fear her
laughing would interrupt the scene. Sometimes Willow
was just too cute.</p>

<p>"W-w-we need to finish the popcorn." Tara said as she
pointed to the microwave.</p>

<p>"We are. I mean it's not like we can put some witchy
spell on it to make it cook any faster now can we?"
Willow's broad smile curled into another grin Buffy
had never seen before, and the blonde slayer watched
as Tara gulped in trepidation.</p>

<p>"Willow." Tara's soft deep voice was nearly lost to
the slayer, but Buffy managed to hear enough of the
blonde's tone to know that she was both afraid, and
aroused. </p>

<p>It didn't take long for Buffy to figure out why. In a
flash Willow twirled the blonde wiccan back around
facing the microwave. She pushed her body against
Tara's back. When Tara tried to protest by pushing her
away, Willow grabbed Tara's hands and placed them
firmly on the counter top, palms flat. </p>

<p>"Stay." She said commandingly. </p>

<p>
It was Buffy's turn to gulp. This was so wrong. She
should turn right around and head back into the living
room. She was watching something that was meant to be
between ‘those’ two... not shared. But she couldn't
move. She had to admit, she was intrigued by the two
wiccans. </p>

<p>When Willow had announced that she and Tara where more
than just 'Wicca buddies’, it had taken some time for
Buffy to really get use to that fact. And she had…
gotten use to it, mostly because she absolutely adored
Willow. The slightly neurotic babbling redhead was as
dear to her as her own little sister. </p>

<p>Plus, Tara was the kind of person it was almost
impossible to dislike. Her shyness and vulnerability
made you want to hold her and protect her forever, but
her knowledge and willingness to help when the scary
stuff got 'real' scary, even though you could tell she
was petrified most of the time, made one admire her. </p>

<p>So Buffy had gotten used to Willow and Tara as a
couple... and Tara as a friend. So when she started to
move beyond the initial shock, she started thinking
about... well... Willow AND Tara. And what exactly
Willow AND Tara did together… as a couple. She often
found herself, patrolling late at night – alone -
letting her mind wander to places she knew a best
friend shouldn’t let their mind wander to.</p>

<p>All Buffy knew was that Willow looked happier than she
had ever seen her, and Tara stuttered a LOT less these
days.</p>

<p>So right here, right now, watching the two of them,
well Buffy just couldn't help herself.</p>

<p>"Where's..."</p>

<p>Buffy quickly clamped a hand over Anya's annoying
mouth. A quick glance back into the kitchen told her
that neither of the girl’s had heard Anya approach.</p>

<p>"Shhh." Was all Buffy said and pointed into the
kitchen. </p>

<p>As if in total understanding, Anya simply nodded.
Buffy resumed her place on the right side of the
doorframe, while Anya took up residence on the left
side. They both turned their eyes back towards the
kitchen… to Willow and Tara.</p>

<p>Tara had moved her hand again and Willow placed her
own over the blonde's. Running her fingers over the
smooth top she whispered into Tara's ear, "Stay."</p>

<p>Tara shivered, thought about putting a stop to this,
and decided she just didn't have the willpower. It was
so hard for her to deny Willow anything. Laying her
hand on the counter, she simply nodded. Buffy could
see that Tara's compliance seemed to change Willow's
demeanor. The redhead's smile disappeared and was
replaced by a more serious look. Taking a small step
back, Willow thought for a moment, and than gently
eased Tara's legs open a little further. She than
pulled Tara's hips back a little so that the taller
girl was leaning over the counter slightly. </p>

<p>Willow's breathing increased as she licked her dry
lips. Rubbing her hands together to warm them, she
took a step forward into Tara's open legs. Locking her
feet on the inside of Tara's ankles, she pushed the
blonde's legs open a little further and than leaned
into her body. "Love you." She whispered into Tara’s
ear.</p>

<p>Both Buffy and Anya physically leaned forward into the
kitchen to listen to the words Willow caressed into
Tara's ear. Buffy quickly glanced at Anya as if to ask
'maybe we should leave?' But when Anya simply
continued to stare at the two wiccans, the last bit of
conscious Buffy had slide away and she turned her eyes
back to the scene.</p>

<p>Willow slowly ran her right hand up Tara's bare arm,
gently over her shoulder and even more tortuously slow
down the blondes' back. Once again reaching that small
bit of exposed flesh right above Tara's skirt, she let
her fingers slip softly underneath. The soft moan that
escaped the blonde’s lips nearly caused Buffy’s knees
to give way. 'Wow.' Was all she could think, because
her mind, not to mention her body, just seemed to
start pulsating when she heard Tara's voice. </p>

<p>Willow slowly began to lift up Tara's shirt. Her
fingers lightly dragging upward as more and more pale
flesh was uncovered. Willow stopped only when she was
satisfied enough of Tara’s back was exposed to her.
She then held the shirt up and bent down, her lips
began to caress along the same path her fingers had
traveled. </p>

<p>Tara dipped her head forward, her hair fanning out
along the counter. Closing her eyes tightly. She
allowed her body to enjoy the touches her lover, her
life, her Willow where enflaming her with. A slow line
of heated kisses were placed up the side of her back,
and when she felt that heat reach the edge of her bra,
Tara grabbed desperately for something more stable to
steady herself against. </p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The voice warned, and Tara replaced her hand on the
counter, hoping her legs wouldn’t give out and she
wouldn’t crash, forehead first, onto the hard tiled
surface. Willow really could be quite sadistic at
times... in a mini-sadistic kind of way.</p>

<p>Buffy couldn't believe three things; first, that she
was actually STILL watching this; second, that Willow
was quite the little control freak, and third; that
the sight of Tara's exposed back was making her quite
hot. And not in the ‘turn-on-the-air-conditioner’ kind
of way. She dared not even glance over at Anya. She
knew if she did, she'd probably feel very, very
embarrassed. </p>

<p>Or more realistically, if she had looked over at Anya,
the ex-demon would most likely have sanctioned her
voyeuristic adventure. Not too mention that looking
away might cause her to missing what was happening
before her eyes.</p>

<p>After she had scolded her girlfriend for moving her
hand, Willow allowed her lips to go back to sucking on
Tara's back, just below her bra. Deciding she wanted
freer access to Tara's body, she swiftly grabbed the
edge of Tara’s shirt and pulled it roughly over her
head. Discarding it disdainfully on the floor. </p>

<p>Tara quickly repositioned her hands on the counter. </p>

<p>It was strange, even though Tara sometimes got a
little scared when Willow would play these little
games with her, in a way, it completely turned her on.
And right now, she was very turned on. She could feel
the heat pulsating in regions of her body slightly
southward. Tara wasn't sure if it was the fact that
either Buffy or Anya could walk in at any moment, or
that, even though Willow was completely in charge, she
knew that whatever she did, would do, would be to
please Tara. She had never had that before... someone
who loved her so much with every ounce of their being,
that they would concentrate on nothing more than
making her happy. Making her feel loved. Making her
feel the way she did right now, aroused.</p>

<p>All conscious thought was abruptly ended when Tara
felt Willow's hands wrap around her body, skid across
her ribs, and arch upward hungrily filing themselves
with her breasts. </p>

<p>"Goddess." Was all the coherent language that slipped
from Tara’s lips as she gave totally into her bodies
wants and needs. She pushed herself forward into
Willow’s hands as the redhead squeezed and played with
her. </p>

<p>Buffy wrapped her hand around the wooden molding of
the doorframe and began to dig her nails in. This was
a little more than she had bargained for. She'd never
really thought of Willow... and well Tara for that
matter, as these, well… as these sexual beings. Ones
with, from what she could see, quite a hungry appetite
for one another. And it was all just so damn erotic.
She continued to be riveted by the scene.</p>

<p>Willow began to rake her fingernails over the already
stiffened nipples of her beloved through the silky
white bra. At the same time, she attached her lips to
the back of Tara's neck and slowly began licking,
nipping and kissing from just below her ear, to the
edge of the blondes shoulder. Up and down again, she
continued the sweet torture of Tara's nipples. </p>

<p>She never seemed to get enough of Tara. Touching her,
kissing her. Touching Tara was all she ever dreamed of
these days. When they were with the Scooby's, or
others, she'd have to satiate her needs with a small
touch on the elbow, or a quick squeeze of Tara's hand;
but when they were alone, Willow wanted to touch
ever-tiny bit of Tara's flesh. Inside, out, up and
down. And she took every free moment that they were
alone, like now, to indulge in her favorite pastime...
Tara. </p>

<p>Allowing her left hand to remain fondling Tara's
nipple, her lips followed her right hand as she bent
down groping for the edge of Tara's skirt. Willow
kissed the small of Tara's back as she began to ease
her hand underneath the long flowing garment. She felt
Tara beginning to shiver uncontrollably underneath her
as she dragged her hand upward. Nails scratching
lightly on the outside of the silkiest thigh Willow
had ever felt. </p>

<p>As Willow lifted Tara's skirt up higher and higher,
more of the blonde's pale leg was exposed to Buffy's
view. Her eyes widened in worried realization at just
how far Willow might take this. Did she really want to
see her best friend making love to her girlfriend?
Because, at the rate Willow was going, that's just
what might be happening at any moment.</p>

<p>Sensing that Buffy was starting to waver, Anya quickly
looked over at the slayer. Cringing her face in
warning, she shook her head no as if to say 'you
better not stop them.' Not waiting for Buffy's
response, the ex-demon turned her attention back to
the two witches. </p>

<p>Oh she was so enjoying the show. When first Tara, than
Willow and finally Buffy had disappeared without
getting her any popcorn, Anya had huffed out of her
sleeping bag and angrily made her way to the kitchen.
She instantly knew something was up when she saw Buffy
peering around the corner like a kid watching
something they weren’t meant to see. She had spoken up
only to be brutally, something she was most definitely
going to tell Xander about tomorrow, quieted by the
blonde. Buffy had motioned inside the kitchen, and
once Anya had gotten her own glimpse of what was going
on, she was all too willing to settle in for the ride.
She had seen quite a lot in her
'too-many-years-too-mention' lifespan, and one of her
favorite hobbies, one that had stayed with her through
the years, was watching other people have sex. It was
a pastime she had introduced Xander to, and she was
most definitely not going to miss the opportunity to
watch two live people have a little romp. Especially,
since these days all she got to quench that particular
amusement was when she sent her boyfriend out to rent
porn videos. Plus, the two witches were quite fun to
watch!</p>

<p>Willow's hand stopped when it reached Tara's hip.
Although much of the skirt still hung down around the
shy girl’s legs, the entire side of one leg was
completely exposed to the chilly night air. Willow
wrapped the end of the skirt into the waist band
holding it up, pushing Tara's leg open further, she
draped her hand on her girlfriends thigh and slowly
began to caress her way towards the front. </p>

<p>Not able to stand the heat that was pulsating through
her veins any longer, Tara stood up and dropped her
head back onto Willow's shoulder. Willow took the
offered exposed neck and began to suck ruthlessly on
the pulsating flesh. Tara wrapped her hand into the
redhead’s short trestles and held her firmly against
her body. While Willow's left hand continued to
indulge in the feel of Tara's nipple, her right hand
worked its way forward and upward. Propping her foot
up on a slightly open draw near the floor, Willow
lifted up Tara's leg placing it over her knee, the
blondes' foot dangled against Willow's calf. Willow
now had all the access she desired and she did not
hesitate, her hand moving swiftly to Tara's center.</p>

<p>Both Buffy and Anya's breathing increased... loudly.
On either side of the doorframe they were both leaning
into the kitchen as far as they could and still remain
hidden. A very hard task indeed as Anya soon
discovered. Tripping slightly in her eagerness, she
stumbled slightly forward into the kitchen. Standing
frozen, she waited to be yelled at. When neither of
the witches turned around, she turned and grinned
towards Buffy and simply stood where she was. It would
serve them right if they turned around and saw both
her and Buffy watching them. After all, they had
forgotten about her popcorn.</p>

<p>Tara roughly pulled Willow's lips away from her neck
and towards her mouth. Devouring the redhead the
instant she felt Willow's fingers touching her
panties. The moan that escaped her lips sent a
dizzying sound that seemed to fill the entire space.
Pulling Willow away from her so she could look into
her green eyes, Tara said one simple word...</p>

<p>"Please."</p>

<p>It was more than Willow could bare and she quickly
worked her fingers past the waste band of Tara's
panties.</p>

<p>BING!</p>

<p>The sudden sound of the microwave as it finished
nuking the popcorn scared all of them and Buffy
squealed. Buffy squealing brought the attention of
Willow and Tara towards her, than Tara screamed... </p>

<p>"Oh my god!"</p>

<p>Pushing Willow away from her, she grabbed her shirt
from the floor and rushed passed the other two women,
making a mad dash up the stairs to the second floor
bathroom. </p>

<p>Buffy just stood there utterly embarrassed and ashamed
of herself for watching. Willow leaned against the
counter with a look on her face half way between
mortified, and smug, and Anya.... she just pushed her
way past Willow and grabbed her popcorn.</p>

<p>"You were taking too long" She said nonchalantly and
headed back into the living room leaving the two
friends standing their shocked.</p>

<p>It had taken Willow nearly an hour to coax Tara out of
the bathroom. When she had finally succeeded, Willow
had firmly eyed both Buffy and Anya warning them both
not to mention what had happened in the kitchen. Anya
just flicked her hand at the two wiccan’s in annoyance
and went back to watching her movie. Buffy just
smiled.</p>

<p>Everyone started to settle themselves down once again.
Tara opted to squish herself as far into the side of
the couch as she could, while Willow sat next to her.
Buffy, who had been sitting at the other end of the
couch, decided to slide off and sit on the floor,
while Anya scrunched into the sleeping bag on the
floor. For the rest of the movie, all four of them sat
in silence, munching on popcorn and M&M's. </p>

<p>Well, Willow watched Tara more than the movie. She was
kind of worried. All she could hear Tara saying as she
tried to get her girlfriend to come out of the locked
bathroom was, "I can't believe this... I can't believe
this..." over and over again. Willow felt guilty of
course. Because, like always... and there were more
times then just this one instant in recent months, she
was the one who had instigated such events. Tara
really never complained. Well, she usually protested,
but than she usually gave into whatever Willow
wanted... and that's what was bothering Willow the
most right now. Did she push Tara into these things? </p>

<p>Willow kept trying to get some answers from Tara's
eyes, but the blonde would not look at her. She simply
stared, uninterested, at the TV. She wouldn't even
take any popcorn when Willow offered her the bowl.
Willow knew she was embarrassed. Tara always got
embarrassed. When they had finally acknowledged their
feelings for one another, Tara seemed to get
embarrassed even when they were holding hands. Willow,
on the other hand, was simply oblivious to everything
that went on around them. All she wanted was to be
with Tara, to touch… to touch her all the time. </p>

<p>It was hard for Tara at first to get use to Willow’s
constant affections. She was so uncomfortable with the
physical stuff, especially in public. It wasn't like
she hid how she felt for Willow. Anyone with his or
her eyes opened only had to look at Tara to realize
it. The blonde had the ability to tell an entire
story, or a simple emotion, with expressions… with her
eyes. Every time she looked at Willow, the redhead
melted and she would instinctively reach out for the
blonde. Willow knew she was loved. </p>

<p>In a sense, Willow had tried to convince herself that
all the public 'stuff' they had done as of late was
her way of helping Tara get over the uncomfortableness
of their relationship. At least that's what she tried
to tell herself right before she'd get a mischievous
little glint in her eye as she pushed Tara into the
bathroom stall of the Bronze... or into the bathroom
at Giles apartment. Yeah, she did manage to convince
herself that she was just 'helping' Tara that's for
sure! </p>

<p>But now... well the reality of that ‘help’ was
painfully staring her in the face. Tara seemed to be
trying to bury herself even deeper into the far end of
the couch, not wanting anyone, especially Willow, to
touch her. That’s when Willow knew she’d gone too far.</p>

<p>
Sighing defeated she got up. "I'm going to get another
drink. Anyone want another?" She posed to the group
waiting for a response. Only Anya and Buffy shook
their heads no, so she sulked into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Buffy watched as Willow left, snuck a look out of the
corner of her eye at Tara, and decided she'd better go
talk to her friend. Try to fix this. Half of it was
her fault anyway! So she got up and followed the
redhead into the kitchen.</p>

<p>The first thing Buffy saw when she entered the kitchen
was Willow was softly banging her head against the
outside of the refrigerator door. Buffy quickly went
over to her and made her stop. "Will," the redhead
looked at her, burgeoning tears in her eyes. "Lets sit
down." Buffy said, leading them both to the kitchen
stools. </p>

<p>Willow didn't look at Buffy. She simply stared at her
empty glass. Both of her hands wrapped tightly around
the plastic Whinny the Pooh cup Dawn had gotten with a
happy meal... that was, before she decided she was
'too' big and stopped getting happy meals. Buffy
unclenched one of Willow's hands and held it.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry Will."</p>

<p>"Oh, no Buffy it's all my fault..." Willow faltered
slightly.</p>

<p>"Absolutely not Will! Anya and I..." Buffy's voice
trailed off momentarily, "... we should have never...
ya know... watched." The slayer squirmed in her chair
uncomfortably. </p>

<p>"Oh Buffy." Willow nearly sobbed and leaned into her
friend for a hug. "I think I've really messed things
up. I mean really really."</p>

<p>Both girls hugged each other tighter and Buffy let
Willow cry on her shoulder. After a moment, she pulled
her friend away so she could look into her eyes.</p>

<p>"I doubt that Wills. I mean you and Tara, you’re like,
like... soul mates or something." Shaking her head and
frowning Buffy continued, "I don't know. But I do know
that the two of you are perfect together... you know
that." She smiled up at green eyes that seemed to
light up slightly. Wiping away a tear, "You are you
know? I look at the two of you together sometimes and
my heart aches. I don't know if I'll ever be that
close to someone else ever again... that much love." </p>

<p>"But Riley..."</p>

<p>Buffy just shook her head, "No," she said almost
defeated, "No, Riley and I, we... I don't know what we
have, but it's not like what you and Tara have.  Will.
Nothing’s like that." </p>

<p>This time it was Willow who wiped a lone tear from her
friends’ cheek. "You will Buffy. Maybe not with Riley,
but you will." </p>

<p>Buffy smiled in gratitude. "Why do you think you've
messed it up Will? I mean Tara's still here isn't
she?"</p>

<p>"Yeah I know, but she won't even look at me Buffy."
Willow pouted as she pulled away from her friend and
got up to refill her drink. "Not to mention let me
touch her." She added haphazardly.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe she figures you've touched her enough for
one night."</p>

<p>"Buffy!" Willow was about to throw an ice cube at her
'friend', when Buffy threw up her hands up mollified. </p>

<p>"Whoa there slugger, only kidding."</p>

<p>"It's not funny Buffy, I really... it's like... you
don't understand." Willow finally settled on, not
really sure how to explain things to Buffy. </p>

<p>Although her friend had accepted her relationship with
Tara, Willow knew Buffy was still a little
uncomfortable with the idea. And the redhead wasn’t
quite sure Buffy was ready to hear about some things
related to her relationship with Tara. </p>

<p>A myriad of emotions passed over the redheads face as
she looked at her friend. As if sensing what was
holing the Willow back, Buffy reached out her hand to
her. Willow took it and sat back down.</p>

<p>"Willow, I know I haven't been the bestest bud I
should have been since you and Tara... well, since you
and Tara, but I want to be there for you. I want you
to know you can tell me anything." Buffy tried to
emphasis the last word so she didn't have to explain
any further. The redhead’s eyes light up in
understanding. </p>

<p>"Are you sure Buffy? Because, because I really need
someone to talk to about me and Tara stuff
sometimes... I mean, REALLY." </p>

<p>Buffy stared at her wide eyed friend waiting in
anticipation, "Yes, Will I'm sure."</p>

<p>A weight seemed to lift from Willow's shoulders and
she settled in next to Buffy. "It's like… I don't know
what it is Buffy. I've never been able to figure it
all out. And it's not the magic thing either. I mean I
thought it was at first, the magic. I thought that was
why I felt the way I did about Tara. So drawn to
her... so... um..." Willow looked at Buffy out of the
corner of her eye wondering if her friend was really
ready to hear all this. Buffy nodded telling Willow to
continue. "I wanted her bad Buffy. Like real bad! I
even did something that I'm not to proud of." Suddenly
worried, Willow glanced towards the rest of the house
making sure no one was listening than lowered her
voice, "you can't tell anyone Buffy, no one." The
redhead looked at her friend slightly afraid.</p>

<p>"Will, what did you do?" She questioned. Of course she
would never tell.</p>

<p>"I... I... I kinda looked. Um, peaked, at Tara. Kinda
when she didn't know it... like she was asleep."
Willow looked away ashamed, but Buffy didn't quite
understand and Willow could tell. </p>

<p>"Um Buffy, when Tara and I met we were friends, just
friends. But we started seeing a lot of each other
and, um," Willow adjusted her position on the chair
and looked directed into Buffy’s eyes, "do you
remember the night I said I was in the chem lab all
night... by myself?" Willow waited a moment for the
memory to come to Buffy, when she saw the recognition
in her friends hazel eyes, she continued. "I wasn't in
the chem lab, and I wasn't by myself. I was with Tara.
We were doing spells all night and that's when things
started to change. I mean, I started to feel something
for her, and I started to ya know, think about her."
Ducking her head in embarrassment Willow continued,
"Kinda naughty things about her." </p>

<p>Buffy smiled. That was the silly goofy Wills she
remembered so well. </p>

<p>"We kept spending more and more time together doing
spells and stuff. And after a while, being with Tara
all the time, I-I-I just couldn't take it any more
Buffy!" Willow said acerbated. "All I could think of
was touching her and feeling her, and seeing her
and... and..." It took a moment for Willow to calm her
babble down. "And I felt like if I didn't see her,
touch her, I'd explode. But I was so afraid Buffy. I
didn’t want to feel… feel like that for a girl.”
Willow paused only long enough to flash one of her
puppy dog sad looks in Buffy’s direction. </p>

<p>“I knew how Tara felt, which, now that I think about
what I did it seems so incredibly stupid. All I had to
do was ask and I'm sure Tara would have let me touch
her anywhere I wanted." A large grin graced the
redhead’s lips, but quickly faded again. Frowning she
continued, "I, we were doing spells all night and got
tired. So I stayed over at Tara's, and while she was
sleeping, I kind of... ya know... peeked." The last
word squeaked out of Willow's lips.</p>

<p>"Peeked? I don't get it Willow."</p>

<p>Willow sighed resigned. She knew she'd have to tell
Buffy the entire story. Sometimes her friend really
could be quite dense!</p>

<p>“Will just tell me what you did, okay.” Buffy nodded
towards Willow to continue.</p>

<p>“It was that night, you know, when you got into the
Initiative and we were suppose to be at the Bronze
together, but you showed up like an hour late.” Willow
looked at Buffy sideways and the slayer tried not to
feel too guilty about that night. “Well, I went to see
Tara. I mean, she wanted me to come over but I had
kind of brushed her off to go to the Bronze for the
Scooby thing.” </p>

<p>Okay, now Buffy did feel guilty. </p>

<p>“So I just showed up in the middle of the night, even
though I knew she had been hurt by what I said
earlier… so I just show up and she had the most
beautiful wonderful smile on her face and I just
wanted to melt. We did a bunch of spells that night
and were pretty exhausted, so Tara had suggested I
stay the night.” Willow stopped just long enough to
catch her breath. “So anyway, we were lying in bed and
she was just so close… right there and I… and I…”
Willow’s voice trailed off into the silence of the
kitchen. </p>

<p>After a moment, the frown that had creased across
Willow’s forehead subsided a bit. </p>

<p>“I don’t know Buffy. I mean I never felt like that
before.” Willow seemed to settle into her memories as
Buffy simply waited for her to continue again. </p>

<p>“I loved Oz. I loved being with him. And he was so
sweet and gentle, but there’s something about Tara… I
feel… it’s so strong Buffy.” The words whispered out
of the redhead’s lips. “I just wanted so much to touch
her.” Willow said finally with a heavy exhausted sigh.</p>

<p>
Buffy shifted in the hard wooden stool and took
Willow’s hand in her own. “What did you do Willow?”
She urged gently. </p>

<p>Willow stared off into nothing as she recounted that
night.</p>

<p>< * Flashback – The ‘I’ in Team * ></p>

<p>Tara’s dorm room was so dark that it took a few
minutes before Willow’s eyes adjusted. When they did,
she let them drift slowly around marveling at
everything she saw. All the little knick-knacks and
pictures, every small detail unraveled a bit more of
the mystery that the blonde still was to Willow. Time
ticked and Willow simply enjoyed the quiet heat from
the body next to hers. Unsure of how long she had been
gazing at Tara’s belongings, a sudden rhythmic
breathing drew Willow’s attention. She swallowed in
apprehension. All the emotions, all the desires began
to swirl uncontrolled inside of her as she turned to
face Tara.</p>

<p>The blonde was lying on her back. Her hair fanned out
on her pillow, her head tilting slightly to the right.
Willow licked her dry lips as her eyes lingered
downward. Tara’s hands where resting one on top of the
other on her stomach, one hand gripping the cover that
barely reached her waist. Willow’s eyes made another
slow pass back up the blonde’s body taking in more
minute details. Like the fact that Tara’s long exposed
neck looked so smooth in the moonlight. And how the
oversized jersey shirt she wore to bed had one of the
top buttons missing. And how, because of that missing
button, the edges of the shirt drifted down to her
shoulders exposing a vast expanse of flesh. </p>

<p>Willow’s neck began to ache, so she flipped onto her
right side so she could continue to simply watch the
blonde sleep. Tara was so still, calm. Just like when
she’s awake. Willow mused to herself, but her
wanderings were suddenly cut short when Tara shifted.
The blonde darted a leg in Willow’s direction, her
knee bending, as she stroked her foot on the redhead’s
calf. </p>

<p>Willow froze, her eyes fluttered shut as Tara’s leg
slipped between her own.  She tried desperately to
suppress the moan begging to be released. After a
moment, Tara calmed again, and Willow began to as
well. </p>

<p>But the darkness, and the heat of Tara’s leg between
her own infused Willow with a desire that would not go
unquenched. Without even thinking, she reached a shaky
hand out for the large red button that rested between
Tara’s breasts. The plastic bit slipping from its
confine all too easily, and Willow looked back up to
make sure Tara was still asleep. </p>

<p>Knowing she’d gone to far to stop this, stop herself,
Willow’s breathing increased even though she was
desperately trying to remain quiet. Carefully she
pulled back one side of the jersey, her eyes widening
in amazement as one of Tara’s breasts was revealed to
her. </p>

<p>For the longest time Willow simply looked, biting her
lip. And while her mind babbled silently, too
distracted to stop her body, her hand hovered towards
the blonde’s exposed breast. A single finger grazed
downward over Tara’s nipple as the flesh stiffened.</p>

<p>“Willow.” The word whispered through hazy desire into
the still room.</p>

<p>Willow froze in absolute horror thinking for sure that
Tara had woken and would be kicking her out of the
room at any moment. Willow remained incredibly still
as her heart pound in her chest. When what seemed like
an eternity passed and she was still on the bed,
instead of kicked on the floor, Willow cautiously
looked back up at Tara. </p>

<p>The blonde was still sound asleep.</p>

<p>Hurriedly Willow buttoned the jersey back up, drew the
covers back up to Tara’s waist, flipped over on her
other side and burred her face in her hands. Mortified
at what she had done.</p>

<p>< * End Flashback * ></p>

<p>Willow tried to gain some control over her body, which
seemed to be doing things that she really didn’t want
it to be doing sitting next to her best friend, as she
finished her story. “Um… I thought for sure she’d wake
up, but she never did. And than I realized what I had
done and I got all nervous and guilty and… I mean… I
like molested her Buffy!”</p>

<p>Willow squeaked that last sentence out quickly and sat
quietly not looking at her friend. She really didn’t
know what she was expecting. Maybe someone to tell her
what a bad person she was for doing something so
naughty. Or possibly someone to tell her what she did
was perfectly normal. That wanting someone… well a
girl, that bad, as bad as she had wanted Tara, was
okay. Maybe she just wanted everything to be okay
again. </p>

<p>Buffy quickly tried to gather her thoughts. The first
one that went through her mind was ‘wow.’ She had
never realized what a horn dog her best friend was.
The second thought was sadness. Regret. She hated
herself for not being there to help Willow through all
this in the first place. But she couldn’t fix the
past, only the present… the now. </p>

<p>“Willow, if you want me to tell you what you did to
Tara was okay, well I can’t. Only Tara can tell you
that.” Buffy saw her friend’s face turned downward,
crestfallen. “But if you want me to tell you that what
you were feeling back then, what your feeling now, is
alright, then I will. It _so_ is Willow. It’s
perfectly all right for you to love Tara, to… want her
as much as you do.” Buffy seemed to be at a loss for
what to say next, but she tried to just continue
onward, “I don’t know Willow. I don’t know what to
tell you. I love you. You’re my bestest best friend.
You take care of me and look after me, and you’ve
always been there for me even when I’m not always
there for you, and all I want is for you to be happy.
And Tara makes you happy. That’s like SO obvious. And…
and Tara’s such a wonderful girl Will. I don’t know.”
Buffy kind of threw her hands up in confusion. “Just
love her Will, and tell her and… and everything will
be okay.”</p>

<p>Okay, so maybe it wasn’t Buffy’s finest best friend
moment, but something she said must have made sense to
Willow because the girl’s green eyes lit up like
spotlights and she smiled widely. They just stared at
each other for what seemed like the longest time. </p>

<p>It was Willow who finally spoke up. Her voice was firm
and reassured. “Thanks Buffy.” It seems so simple, but
it meant everything. Willow’s smile took on a more
mischievous glow, “ssoooo, you don’t mind if we have
these little talks more often then do you? I mean, ya
know, comparing stuff… and stuff?” </p>

<p>The redhead’s green eyes sparkled and Buffy’s widened,
than frowned, ‘what have I gotten myself into,’ she
thought to herself. But before either could speak
another voice chimed in.</p>

<p>“Um…” The soft low voice was unmistakable and Willow
immediately turned towards the kitchen entrance.
“A-a-are you going to come back inside? Anya wants to
start another movie.” Tara just looked down at the
floor solemnly. </p>

<p>“Tara!” Willow squeaked and rushed over to her.
Instinctively she grabbed for the blonde girl’s hand
but caught herself and held back. Turning a pleading
look towards Buffy.</p>

<p>“I’ll go in and see what’s the what with Anya.” Buffy
got up and headed out of the kitchen. “You two need to
talk.” She patted Willow on the shoulder and left.</p>

<p>An awkward silence hung between the two lovers. Tara
still looking at the floor, and Willow wanting more
than anything for the blonde to look up at her.
“Tara?” Willow finally questioned softly. </p>

<p>Tara lifted her head slowly, as if lifting it too fast
would cause the headache she had to knock her off
balance. As sad blue eyes finally meet hopeful green
eyes, Willow ventured cautiously and took Tara’s hand
in her own. When the blonde did not protest or pull
away, Willow tightened her grip. “I’m so sorry Tara.
Please…” Willow tried hard to choke down the tears
that were threatening to overwhelm her. She couldn’t
loose Tara… she just couldn’t. “I… I… sorry, so
sorry.” Was all she could think to say and she
repeated it over and over again, softly.</p>

<p>Tara reached her free hand up and gently cupped
Willow’s tear stained check. “Willow.” It was soft and
filled with love and it melted the redhead’s heart…
like hearing Tara whisper her name always did. </p>

<p>Willow threw herself into Tara’s arms. “Please don’t
leave me. I couldn’t bear it if you left me.” Willow
managed to say through her increased weeping, grabbing
onto Tara with all her might.</p>

<p>“Oh Willow.” The blonde sighed and wrapped her arms
tightly around her beloved. “I would never leave you.
Not now, not ever. I don’t think I could survive
without you.”</p>

<p>Willow pulled away and looked into her girlfriends’
eyes. “Promise?” She sounded like a scared child, but
she really didn’t care… because in a way, that’s
exactly how she felt.</p>

<p>Tara smiled softly, placed a single kiss on Willow
check and leaned towards her ear, “Promise.” </p>

<p>They stood embracing each other for some time until
they both had gained some of their composure. Willow
mustered up some courage and finally spoke, “I’m so
sorry Tara. I know you don’t… you… I know I kind of
for….” A gentle finger on her lips stopped her.</p>

<p>“No Willow, you don’t make me do anything I don’t want
to do. I want you… need you to know, understand that.
It’s just, um, s-s-sometimes…” Tara didn’t know how to
say it.</p>

<p>“No, your right, I-I I kinda get a little crazed
sometimes,” the redhead smiled playfully, “but Tara,”
she brought the girl’s hand to her cheek and rubbed it
gently against her face. “Sometimes I just need you so
much it scares me and I forget about everything,
everyone, and I just want you… now, or then, or… well
most of the time.”</p>

<p>Tara chuckled softly, understanding. “I know Willow,
and I want you too, all the time. But some things are
hard…” she trailed off leaving the words unsaid. Words
they had already discussed. Pasts they had already
unearthed to one another. Willow shook her head in
understanding.</p>

<p>“I promise I’ll try to control myself more.”
Unfortunately it came out of her mouth a little to
gleefully and both girls laughed. </p>

<p>“Okay.” Was all Tara could manage before the screaming
from the living room began to assault their ears.</p>

<p>“… care that you said no, I wanna watch it!” Anya
scowled at Buffy as she tried to wrestle the video out
of the slayers firm grip.</p>

<p>“No Anya. I told you I am not watching this damn
movie!” Winning the battle, Buffy yanked the tape from
the ex-demon’s grip and flung it across the room. Her
extra slayer strength kicked in and the tape shattered
into pieces and flew all over the living room.
Everyone just stood their ground stunned.</p>

<p>“Um…” It was, surprisingly, Tara who was the first to
speak. Raising her hand slightly as if asking a
question in school, “Um… what movie was it?”</p>

<p>Suddenly the other three burst out laughing. Tara
watched the three with an amused look on her face not
quite understanding what was so funny. When every one
finally settled down, Anya spoke up.</p>

<p>“Well, we could talk about sex instead.” She dove her
hand into the bowl of popcorn in front of her and
started munching.</p>

<p>“Anya!” Willow warned, not wanting to head down a road
she knew would upset Tara. </p>

<p>“Yeah, come on Wills it’ll be fun.” Okay Buffy chiming
in was absolutely no help at all and Willow frowned.</p>

<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>Now Willow was shocked! “Um Tara are you sure?” She
couldn’t believe her girlfriend had just said ‘okay.’</p>

<p>“Hey look, if there’s any question that someone is too
uncomfortable to answer, then don’t” Anya interjected
while grabbing a handful of M&M’s. </p>

<p>Willow looked into Tara’s eyes waiting for the other
girl to take the lead. “It’s okay Willow. It’s okay.”
She reassured her as best she could. </p>

<p>Willow grinned loopily and lead them both over to the
couch, “We’re in.” </p>

<p>Everyone got comfy. Anya slid back under her sleeping
bag but sat up leaning against the coffee table. Buffy
slid closer to Willow on the floor and stretched her
legs out under the same table, while Willow and Tara
sat next to each other on the couch. </p>

<p>“So who should start?” The question came from Willow. </p>

<p>“Um… since it was my suggestion, I go first.” Anya
beamed and then concentrated. What do I want to know…
what do I want to know. She pondered. “Okay,” she sat
up gleefully, “how many times, oh say in the last
seven days, has everyone had sex?”</p>

<p>Buffy frowned and Willow began to count on her
fingers.</p>

<p>“Um, clarify ‘times’?” Buffy asked.</p>

<p>Anya looked at her like she was stupid. “You know, how
many times you and Riley have bounced each other off
the walls.”</p>

<p>Tara giggled and covered her mouth and both Willow and
Anya turned and smiled at her warmly. </p>

<p>“Oh,” Buffy said. “Well you first since it was your
question.”</p>

<p>“Okay,” Anya bounced happily. “Over the last seven
days Xander and I have had sex 10 times.” She
exclaimed quite proud of herself.</p>

<p>Buffy grumbled, “Well over the past seven day’s I’ve
had sex… two times.” She almost looked down in shame,
but even more in anger when Anya looked over at her
like she was pathetic.</p>

<p>“Poor slayer.” She said patting her hand. </p>

<p>Buffy growled at her.</p>

<p>“Okay, you two?” The ex-demon pointed at Willow and
Tara expectantly.</p>

<p>Willow finished counting on her fingers and spoke up.
“Okay in the last seven days we’ve had sex 12 times!”</p>

<p>“What!” Anya screamed as if she’d been wounded. Buffy
just looked at both girls with her mouth wide open…
and Tara blushed quite smugly.</p>

<p>“Are you telling me that the two of you are ‘doing it’
almost twice a day?” Anya said in disbelief. When
Willow’s giggling kicked in, she knew that she was
telling the truth. “Damn it! Xander needs to start
picking it up! Damn it! No more sleep for him, no
sire-e… I want more sex!” </p>

<p>Buffy just felt kind of… well, left out.</p>

<p>“Who’s next?” Willow’s bubbling happiness was
infectious.</p>

<p>“Me.”</p>

<p>“Hey, you already went!” Buffy glared at Anya.</p>

<p>“So what, my game, my rules.” Anya stuck her tongue
out at the slayer and posed her next question before
anyone else could protest. “Okay, what is the most
risky place you’ve ever had sex… and you can’t include
the kitchen.” She looked straight at Willow and Tara. </p>

<p>“Hey!” Willow pouted. “Doesn’t matter. We’ve done it
in much better places anyway.” And just as she was
about to spill the beans, Tara finally chimed in.</p>

<p>“Um… W-W-illow.” She wasn’t too sure she wanted the
others to know such a thing. </p>

<p>“We don’t have to answer Tara. It’s okay.” Willow
turned to her girlfriend and held onto her hand. While
they were deciding, Buffy spoke up.</p>

<p>“Well, Riley and I have done it in the cemetery.” She
offered cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Big deal.” Anya scoffed. “Like who hasn’t had sex in
the cemetery?” </p>

<p>Buffy pouted and looked at Willow expecting her friend
to chirp in with a negative. When she saw Willow shrug
at her apologetically and grin, she knew right there
and than that she was not going to like this game one
damn bit!</p>

<p>“Well, what about you Anya?” She asked annoyed.</p>

<p>“Xander and I have had sex in his ice cream truck…”</p>

<p>Before she could finish Buffy interrupted, “What’s so
‘daring’ about that?”</p>

<p>“Well if you’d let me finish!” Anya huffed, “As I was
saying, we had sex in the ice cream truck while Xander
was driving it on the freeway.” She stuck her tongue
out at the blonde and Buffy instantly tried to grab
for it. She really did want to rip it out of the
ex-demon’s mouth.</p>

<p>“Okay, the witches turn.”</p>

<p>“Well, we had sex at the Bronze.” Willow was quite
enjoying herself, especially when her two friends
turned and looked at her eagerly, waiting for her to
spill all the details. </p>

<p>“Actually, w-w-we’ve had sex there a couple of times.”
Willow beamed as Tara’s voiced caressed the room with
ease. She was beginning to loosen up.</p>

<p>“A couple of times?” Buffy asked and Willow just
nodded with a silly grin on her face. </p>

<p>“Where else?” Anya was all intrigued now.</p>

<p>“Um…” Tara thought a moment, “Well,” she ducked her
head shyly, “we did it in Mr. Giles’ bathroom once.” </p>

<p>A shocked gasp escaped from Buffy’s lips, while Anya
just looked appreciatively at the shy witch. </p>

<p>“I’ve always wanted to give that room a try. How was
it?”</p>

<p>“Surprisingly spacious.” Tara continued. “And the
bathtub is really quite large and roomy.” </p>

<p>“Um, I’ll have to drag Xander in there during one of
your boring Scooby meetings.”</p>

<p>“Hey!” Buffy and Willow objected at once. Willow
continued. “Scooby meetings are NOT boring. You’re
boring.” </p>

<p>“Oooo, I’m so hurt.” Anya rolled her eyes and popped
another M&M in her mouth.</p>

<p>Cautiously, Buffy ventured, “So where else have the
two of you…” she pointed at the girl’s rather than
saying it.</p>

<p>“Well, I mean, Tara’s room, of course. Our room… um,
Giles… the Bronze…” Willow trailed off for a moment as
she thought; “We did it in the laundry room of
Stevenson once… or twice. Well, pretty much every time
we do our laundry there. And well, oh,” Willow bounced
excitedly, “We did it in the park once, near a tree,
in broad daylight.” Grinning happily she continued.
“And of course, the cemetery… cause everyone’s done it
there. Oh, the Magic Box…”</p>

<p>“What? When the hell did you do it at the store?”
Buffy was slightly, well numb. She just listened in
awe as her friend ticked off one by one all the places
she had had sex with her girlfriend. Trying to think
about where she had ‘done it’ with Riley. There was
Riley’s, and there was the cemetery… once, and her and
Willow’s dorm room… once, and than there was… well
Riley’s! Man, here she was completely out-sexed by an
ex-demon and her shy, kinda geeky, but not so much
geeky anymore, best friend. </p>

<p>“It was right after Mr. Giles bought it and we were
all helping clean it out.” Tara started saying only to
be interrupted by Willow.</p>

<p>“Yeah, every one went out to get some food, and oh
yeah, Buffy you went out on patrol with Riley, so we
just… well sort of, took advantage of the aloneness.” </p>

<p>“Very smart.” Anya said rather clinically. “You should
take every opportunity when it presents itself.”</p>

<p>“Okay, next question… has anyone ever used toys?”</p>

<p>“What!” Buffy was SO not liking this game. </p>

<p>“Toys ya know dil…”</p>

<p>“Yeah Anya I know, I know. Please stop.”</p>

<p>“So I guess that’s a no for the slayer. Girls?”</p>

<p>“Um, w-w-we’ve talked about it, but we haven’t… um,”
Tara shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>“We haven’t seen the need.” Willow smiled at her
girlfriend.</p>

<p>“Oh well, toys could be very advantageous.”</p>

<p>Buffy just buried her head in her hands. She didn’t
think she could survive the entire night of listening
to Anya give Willow and Tara sex tips. Especially
considering that the two wiccans seemed quite a head
of the game already. Well, at least WAY ahead of her!

“Really?” Willow asked.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, Xander and I find them quite amusing. Just
adds that extra humph to things… if you get my
meaning.” She winked at the two witches who both
blushed.</p>

<p>The three of them broke down into a fit of giggles for
a moment before Anya suddenly posed a question she had
been dying to ask all evening. “So Tara…” the ex-demon
looked poignantly at the blonde, “is Willow the first
person you’ve ever had sex with?” </p>

<p>“Ummm…”</p>

<p>“Hey! I thought we were suppose to ask questions we
could all answer.” Willow jumped to Tara’s defense, as
the blonde looked a bit flustered by the question
directed at her. </p>

<p>Anya just shrugged, “All right. So who was the first
person everyone had sex with?” She stuck her tongue
out at Willow.</p>

<p>Willow scowled at her, but answered, “Oz.”</p>

<p>“Angel.” Buffy said quickly. At least this question
was easy.</p>

<p>“Well, the first time I had sex was with farmer
Lisioux son.” Anya shivered at the not-so-fond memory.
“He owned the farm right next to my fathers. Um, Jack…
Jack was his name. He slobbered all over me for about
five minutes and when he was done, he wept like a
baby. Ick.” Anya was very… very happy that she now had
Xander.</p>

<p>Tara finally answered, feeling comfortable now that
everyone also had. “Willow.” She said with a happy
smile.</p>

<p>“So have you always liked girls Tara?” Anya said as
she grabbed another handful of popcorn.</p>

<p>Again Willow shot the ex-demon a nasty look. </p>

<p>“Yes.” Tara answered softly.</p>

<p>Before Willow could scold her again, Anya asked
everyone else. “What about you two?” She pointed salty
fingers towards Willow and Buffy. “Girls?” </p>

<p>The two friends looked at each other a moment, an
awkwardness crossing between them. Willow really
wasn’t sure this was something she wanted to start
talking about. She looked back at Anya, who kept
stuffing food in her mouth, and than to Tara, who was
looking at her with interest; Willow decided to just
tell the truth.</p>

<p>“Yes…” </p>

<p>Buffy looked at her strangely.</p>

<p>“I mean… I’ve always kinda ya know, “ Willow squirmed
slightly but calmed when she felt Tara’s thumb
stroking across her hand. “I’ve had crushes on girls,
in high school, and stuff like that. But I really
didn’t think about it much till VampWillow.” She
turned to Anya, “Thank you very much!” </p>

<p>Anya stuck her tongue out again.</p>

<p>“And, I don’t know, I had Oz… but sometimes…” Willow
suddenly really didn’t want to talk about this.</p>

<p>“Go on.” To her surprise, it was Buffy that told her
to continue.</p>

<p>“I guess, there was this girl last year, in my
freshman English class, and I just thought how nice it
would be to kiss her.” Willow looked around the room
eyes wide with tepid fear.</p>

<p>Anya had a slightly disinterested glint in her eyes.
Buffy had a frown and Tara… Willow wasn’t sure, but
she thought Tara looked slightly upset. </p>

<p>“I didn’t do anything… I just… just thought about it.
And then I met Tara,” Willow beamed at the blonde,
“and then I really liked girls.” She wiggled her
eyebrows seductively and Tara started giggling
uncontrollably. </p>

<p>“I kissed Faith once.”</p>

<p>The whole room quieted all of the sudden.</p>

<p>“What?” Willow asked completely taken aback.</p>

<p>Buffy just shrugged. “It was after patrol one night
and we were all, ya know, slayerish and I kissed her.”
Grabbing some popcorn, Buffy quickly shoveled it in
her mouth.</p>

<p>Willow looked at her seriously. “Did you like Faith
that way?” </p>

<p>“No. I mean, I didn’t think about it at the time. I
just thought the kiss was because we where all ‘up’
from the slayage. And than, soon after Faith went
all-bad on us and turned up working for the Mayor… and
I just hated her. So I never really thought about it.
But after graduation, and with Faith in the coma… I
think I was attracted to what she could offer me at
the time. Ya know?” Buffy finally looked at Willow.</p>

<p>“I know.” Willow replied sadly.</p>

<p>“Were you ever attracted to Buffy?” </p>

<p>“Uh?” Willow was utterly thrown by the question and
turned to stare at Tara. </p>

<p>Tara blushed brightly and knew the question revealed
some of her own jealousies and insecurities.</p>

<p>Willow turned to face Tara completely and took both
the blonde’s hands in her own. “I think maybe, at
first. Because she was the only person, well besides
Xander and Jessie that paid any attention to me. And
she was so pretty, something I thought I’d never be.”
Willow reached up to lift Tara’s chin when the blonde
dipped her head downward. “But, no, not really. I love
Buffy. She and Xander are closer to me than my own
parents. They’re family, like you.” Willow paused just
long enough to stroke Tara’s cheek. “I’ll love her
forever, but I’m not attracted to her.”</p>

<p>Tara’s eyes brimmed with tears and Willow leaned over
and kissed her delicately on the lips. </p>

<p>“When did you and Tara first have sex?” </p>

<p>“Buffy!” Willow squealed.</p>

<p>“Hey yea. I wanna know that too.” Anya said continuing
to stuff popcorn into her mouth.</p>

<p>“Not fair. You have to ask a question for everyone.”</p>

<p>“So.” Anya shrugged.</p>

<p>“You can’t change the rules of the game… while we’re
playing.” Willow was totally aghast. </p>

<p>“Don’t care.” Anya said with a huge grin on her face.
“Come on… what was it like?” </p>

<p>“Yeah come on Wills. You’re the one who wanted to be
able to talk about ‘stuff’ with me more often. Well
now’s your chance.”  Buffy grinned wickedly at her
friend.</p>

<p>Willow simply stared at Buffy with her mouth wide
open. “B-Buffy. I can’t tell you that. That’s-that’s
like a-a-a me and Tara thing. How can you ask me
that?” </p>

<p>Anya smirked and Buffy kept grinning at Willow,
neither willing to let the redhead off the hook. </p>

<p>“I-I-I-I… Tara?” Willow hoped her girlfriend would
step in and give her a hand. But when she turned to
face the blonde, she saw that Tara had a bit of a
wicked grin on her face as well. Great, Willow
thought. Probably payback for the kitchen. Jeez!</p>

<p>“Okay Fine.” Willow huffed. “The first time Tara and I
had sex was right after the whole Buffy-Faith body
swap thing.” She crossed her arms on her chest and
pouted. </p>

<p>“So?” </p>

<p>“So what?” Willow was really beginning to regret her
playful suggestion to Buffy earlier in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Soooo how was it?” Buffy asked with wicked curiosity.</p>

<p>Willow simply sat in shock on the couch. Horrified
that her friends would ask her such a thing. Fine, if
they’re gonna be like that. Willow thought with a
grumble.</p>

<p>And before she even thought about what she was saying,
Willow rambled onward. “It was the best thing that
ever happened to me.  Tara has the body of a Goddess.
And for someone who claimed to be a virgin she had a
suspiciously talented tongue and knew how to do things
that I thought only porn stars knew how to do and...”</p>

<p>“Willow!”</p>

<p>Willow cringed at the tone in Tara’s voice and both
Buffy and Anya shot her a ‘you’re in trouble now’
look. </p>

<p>The redhead turned to her girlfriend to see that Tara
was absolutely red from head to toe and was looking at
her like she had two heads. Suddenly realizing what
she’d just said, Willow was mortified. “Tara.” Willow
grabbed for the blonde’s hands and giggled cautiously.
“Oops.” She smiled apologetically and everyone held
their breath waiting to see what Tara would do next. </p>

<p>Tara looked at Willow with a bemused look on her face.
“I have the body of a Goddess?” </p>

<p>Willow smiled broadly and bobbed her head up and down.</p>

<p>
“Exactly how talented a tongue does she have?” Anya
asked through a cheek full of puffy corn.</p>

<p>“Tara’s very talented.” Willow said seriously.</p>

<p>“I bet.” </p>

<p>Something in Anya’s voice made Willow turn at look at
her. “Hey! No looking at my girlfriend like that.” She
pouted.</p>

<p>“What. I’m not doing anything.”</p>

<p>“You’re looking at Tara and I just don’t like it.”</p>

<p>“Well, if I’m looking at Tara than she’s looking at
Tara.” Anya pointed to Buffy across the table from her
who was just staring at Tara. </p>

<p>“Hey!” Willow said again with a pout. She threw a
protect arm around Tara, and added a leg just for
emphasis. “Mine.” She said.</p>

<p>“Yours.” Tara said softly and ran a finger slowly down
Willow’s cheek. </p>

<p>“Wow.” Buffy said finally coming out of her
stupor-induced stare-fest.</p>

<p>“Okay, game over. Time for bed.” Willow said as she
jumped up from the couch and grabbed Tara’s hand
pulling the other girl along after her. “Night.” Was
all she said as she led Tara towards the stairs.</p>

<p>“Um, goodnight.” Tara barely managed to get out before
Willow dragged her up to the second floor.</p>

<p>“So you think…” </p>

<p>“Oh, I so think.”</p>

<p>Buffy turned to the ex-demon who had a grin on her
face. </p>

<p>“Ya know it’s not fair. I mean, I think we should be
able to watch.”</p>

<p>“Anya!”</p>

<p>“What? We get all turned on by their little show in
the kitchen earlier, than sit here for like the last
hour listening to their sex-capes, and we know damn
well they’re going up their to have sex… I just think
we deserve to see. Ya know?” Anya looked at the slayer
hopefully.</p>

<p>Buffy had to admit, watching Tara and Willow earlier
and listening to them talk about everything they’ve
done together… well she couldn’t help looking up
towards the top of the steps. “I wonder who’s room
they’re in?” Did she say that out loud?</p>

<p>“Why? Is there some way we could watch if they’re in a
certain room?”</p>

<p>Anya seemed way too eager, and Buffy had to admit she
was a bit too eager herself. “Wwweeelll…”</p>

<p>The next thing she knew Anya had grabbed her hand and
was forcing her up the stairs, “Come on. Lets go see
which room they’re in.” </p>

<p>And surprisingly, Buffy followed.</p>
