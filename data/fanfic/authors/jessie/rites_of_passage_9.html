<!-- Rites of Passage \ Chapter 9: Fumbling Towards Ecstasy -->

<p>Bessie stood in the doorway with her mouth slightly agape for about three seconds. They seemed like three very long seconds to Joey, who felt as if she were caught in one of those dreams where you can't move and can't scream. She knew there was a blanket bunched up at her feet; she just needed to grab it and pull it up...</p>
		<p>"Joey..." Bessie's voice was a strained whisper. "Dawson's here to see you." Then she quickly turned and fled, pulling the door shut behind her.</p>
		<p>Joey put her head down in the hollow of Kaela's neck, and for a moment said nothing. Kaela's ears were so red, she felt as if they were about to burn off her head, and she couldn't have thought of anything to say even if she had found her voice first.</p>
		<p>"Oh...my...God." Joey groaned into Kaela's hair, trying to melt into the mattress and avoid the outside world completely.</p>
		<p>"Joey, what do you want me to do?" Kaela asked, suddenly finding her tongue. "Should I just crawl out the window and get out of here?"</p>
		<p>Joey raised herself up on one arm to look her shy lover in the face, incredulously. "What?"</p>
		<p>"I just want to do whatever's best for you," Kaela continued, her eyes a bit shiny, but bravely holding back her fearful tears. "If you think...it would be better for me not to be here the next time that door opens..."</p>
		<p>"Honey, no," Joey shook her head, stroking Kaela's freckled cheek with her free hand. "How can you think something like that? I'm not ashamed of you...I'm a little ashamed of myself for not being honest with Bessie, I'll admit that, and I wish she hadn't found out this way, but I would've told her." Kaela's green eyes lost a notch or two of their doubtful expression, but she still radiated embarrassment and insecurity. Joey saw it, and she leaned back down and kissed the end of Kaela's nose affectionately.</p>
		<p>"What would you have told her?" Kaela asked carefully.</p>
		<p>"That kissing you is like saying a prayer," Joey whispered close to her ear, her hot breath sending goose bumps down Kaela's back.</p>
		<p>"As if I didn't just adore you *before* I knew you were a Shakespearian," Kaela sighed, pushing her ear against Joey's smiling mouth.</p>
		<p>"But, um...what about bachelor number two?"</p>
		<p>Joey hadn't forgotten that Dawson was sitting in her living room, waiting. She knew Bessie wouldn't have said anything to him about what she'd seen, but he *was* sitting out there waiting for her...to tell her what, Joey had no idea.</p>
		<p>"Welllll," Joey said slowly, "bachelor number two will have to make his own decisions. He took a pretty big chunk out of me earlier tonight, I kind of doubt he's had some sort of mind-blowing change of heart since then, but I guess we'll find out."</p>
		<p>"We?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, we. You're coming out there with me." Kaela's eyebrow shot up as Joey climbed off her to reach for her shirt.</p>
		<p>"Are you, uh, sure that's a good idea?"</p>
		<p>"No, I'm really not sure about anything," Joey said frankly while she zipped up her jeans. "I figure if I'm not gonna be sure anyway, I might as well go with my gut instinct and not second-guess myself. What do you think?"</p>
		<p>"I think I'd do anything for you, Joey, just to see you smile at me like that. Facing Dawson Leery down is the least of it."</p>
		<p>***Wow,*** Kaela thought to herself, ***I am so whipped. But it feels like nirvana.***</p>
		<p>Joey, for her part, blushed deeper than she had after Bessie's little intrusion, and had to exercise all of the willpower available to her not to jump back into bed with this beautiful girl who looked at her like the sun, the moon and all the stars together. She bit the inside of her cheek and leaned back against the wall.</p>
		<p>"Get dressed, my knees can't afford to get any weaker."</p>
		<p>Kaela smiled and obligingly reached for her clothes.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Dawson sat on the familiar old couch with more trepidation than he'd ever imagined possible. He didn't want to lose Joey, that he knew. But he wasn't sure what it meant, really, "losing" her. Did it mean not having sex with her anymore? Or did it mean not talking to her, having her look at him only with the anger and hurt in her eyes that he'd seen the last time she'd been with him? He wasn't sure he could stay with her knowing that Kaela's fingers had been everywhere his had, always wondering what she could do that he couldn't, if he measured up...it was a lot of pressure, that was for sure. And in a way, it felt...intrusive. He just didn't know if he *could* go where someone else had gone, not on Joey, with his hands or his heart. But what else could he do to keep her?</p>
		<p>"Dawson."</p>
		<p>The voice brought him back from his clouded thoughts, into the room where he discovered he'd been pulling a thread out from the edge of the couch cushion next to him. His breath caught in his throat when he saw Joey coming to sit on the couch across from him, holding Kaela's hand firmly in hers. He'd seen that before, and thought it so innocent. When he didn't speak, Joey took a breath and continued.</p>
		<p>"Whatever you came to say, Dawson, you can say it. I'm through with angry words, I'll listen."</p>
		<p>Dawson looked furtively at Kaela for a moment, then tried a few times to swallow the lump in his throat. He snapped off the thread he'd been tugging on, and held it tightly between his fingers, somehow comforted by it.</p>
		<p>"Joey," he began, his voice dry as dust, "I came here because I just couldn't stand leaving things the way we did. The way *I* did. You're my best friend, that comes before anything else, I never meant to be anything but supportive to you."</p>
		<p>Joey's ears were ringing with shock. She might have lost all awareness of her body, were it not for Kaela's thumb pressing into the back of her hand, grounding her.</p>
		<p>"Dawson, I--" "No, Joey, let me finish. I wanted to tell you that...that...I love you no matter what. Any stupid things I say or do are just because I'm afraid of losing you, can you understand that?"</p>
		<p>Joey just nodded, feeling tears in her eyes for what seemed like the hundredth time that day.</p>
		<p>"Anyway, I wanted you to know that, if you want to be with Kaela... well, I won't stand in your way."</p>
		<p>He turned his eyes down to the thread in his hand for that last part; he couldn't quite look his adversary in the eye, as noble as his intentions might be. After a long moment of silence, Joey let out a long breath she hadn't realized she was holding in, along with a whole string of hopes and desires that she hadn't realized she'd been holding in, either.</p>
		<p>"I don't know what to say, Dawson," she managed to get out as she wiped her eyes. "You...you really are cool with this? Cool with your best friend/ex-girlfriend being bi?"</p>
		<p>"I just don't want to lose you," Dawson shrugged, knowing damn well that he wasn't 100% cool with it, but not about to show it. "Besides, I'm a 90's guy, I can take it. I'm not so sure about Bessie, though..."</p>
		<p>At the mention of Bessie's name, Joey turned white as a sheet and Kaela hid her face against Joey's shoulder, confirming Dawson's suspicions when he saw Bessie return from her younger sister's room with a look of total synapse meltdown, and before even offering him a drink or saying 'she'll be out in a minute,' she'd mumbled something about hearing Alexander and rushed out of the room like a dart.</p>
		<p>"One thing at a time," Joey whispered into Kaela's hair, coaxing her bent head back into the conversation, not that she'd done a lot of talking so far. It was enough just knowing she was there.</p>
		<p>As if on cue, Kaela swallowed and sucked her lower lip in, which Joey knew meant she was going to speak.</p>
		<p>"Dawson," she finally started, "I know this might sound trite, I mean, I hardly know you, but thank you for not-- for respecting me." The redness in her ears and cheeks wasn't much diminished, but the frightened woodland creature expression was fading fast.</p>
		<p>"You're welcome," Dawson said simply, not knowing how else to amend himself to the girl who he knew was more terrified than he'd ever been. "...anyone who doesn't respect you just doesn't know you, Kaela."</p>
		<p>That finished her off, and a few tears ran down her cheeks. Joey leaned over and wiped them away with her thumb, cupping Kaela's jawbone in her hand. There was something terribly intimate about the gesture, and the sweet smile that went with it, and it sent a small pang through Dawson's chest. He sighed quietly and reminded himself that this was the only way-- the only way to keep Joey from turning away from him completely. He knew she wasn't about to change her mind about Kaela, and he could either drag his heels through the dirt and find her gone when it was over, or let her go, and hope she'd let him tag along for the ride. Before he could stop it, there were tears in his own eyes. Joey saw it, and jumped up to comfort him.</p>
		<p>"Oh Dawson," she sighed as she she hugged him, "I'm so sorry I hurt you."</p>
		<p>"No," he said as he choked back his tears, "don't be...I love you, Joey."</p>
		<p>"I love you, too." She squeezed him tightly for a moment and then let him go.</p>
		<p>After the confessional moment was gone, the air became tense and the three of them began to feel awkward, so Dawson took his leave.</p>
		<p>Joey was wondering where Bessie had gotten off to, and what she should say to her; Kaela realized she'd left her mom in the lurch, not knowing where she was or when she'd be home. They decided it would be best if they both dealt with their families separately-- for now.</p>
		<p>"As long as my mom doesn't lock me in the basement with posters of Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Affleck, do you want to come over tomorrow night?" Kaela asked playfully, trying to mask her fear with humor.</p>
		<p>"I want to come over right now," Joey murmured, pulling Kaela in by the back of her neck to kiss her. "You make me feel like I can fly," she whispered into her mouth.</p>
		<p>"Oh, I can make you fly," Kaela assured her, returning the kiss enthusiastically. She wanted to keep kissing Joey all night, but her brain had to get in the way and remind her to get the hell home and explain some things to her mom. Reluctantly, she broke it off, but she still couldn't help smiling.</p>
		<p>"Call me when it's over," Joey instructed her. "Don't be scared."</p>
		<p>Kaela nodded, but she *was* scared and there was no way around that. She knew her mom loved her. But this was...a lot for any mom to digest.</p>
		<p>"And when I do, you can tell me how it goes with Bessie."</p>
		<p>Joey nodded back, a little less freaked than steeled-- at least she didn't have to think of a way to break it to her now. She squeezed Kaela's hand in hers, trying to give her strength.</p>
		<p>"I want to drown in you," Kaela sighed, melting just from Joey's hand in hers.</p>
		<p>Joey closed her eyes and bit the inside of her cheek, which Kaela had already figured out was her way of trying to control her lust.</p>
		<p>"You better get out of here right now, or else I'll have to take you up on that."</p>
		<p>Joey kissed her on the cheek once more, and then whispered in her ear, "You know you make my heart stop."</p>
		<p>Kaela blushed and flashed her trademark bashful grin.</p>
		<p>Joey leaned into the doorframe, watching Kaela go. She didn't want to do anything else but watch her walking through the moonlight, with the soft breeze in her hair, on her sweet skin. She *was* scared. But she had jumped off a cliff only to find a working pair of wings tucked behind her arms.</p>
