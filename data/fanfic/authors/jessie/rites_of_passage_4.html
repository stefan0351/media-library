<!-- Rites of Passage \ Chapter 4: It's 1998, Do You Know Where Your Children Are? -->

<p>"Joey," Dawson said as he ran his fingers absently through her hair, "do you realize that we're going to graduate from high school in the year 2000?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I think I realized it when we were freshmen in 1996..." she tried to be sarcastic, as usual, but she was losing her edge these days, Dawson noticed.</p>
		<p>"No, Jo, I mean, do you really realize it? What it means? It's going to be the new millennium before we even get to college! Do you ever think about where we're headed?" Dawson closed his textbook as he spoke, pulling her closer to him. She rested her head against his shoulder, lacing her fingers into his as she responded.</p>
		<p>"What 'we' are we discussing here, Dawson? You and me 'we' or our generation 'we,' or the whole world 'we?'"</p>
		<p>"All of them, I guess, but I meant our generation, mostly. We're not generation X, you know. The last year you could be born to be part of generation X was 1976, so that means everyone in high school and college as of now is...generation 'why'!" He laughed at his own corny joke, playing up the pun.</p>
		<p>"Ha ha, Dawson, very original. I guess I've thought about it...I mean the status quo is constantly changing, every generation reacts to whatever came before-- I guess that means we've got to get frumpy and religious pretty quick." She turned herself onto her stomach, looking Dawson in the eye.</p>
		<p>"Not a chance," he murmured, hooking his thumb under her chin to pull her into a kiss. She returned it, sinking into his chest so they hardly knew whose arms and legs were whose, and hardly caring, either-- until there was a loud and deliberate knock on the door.</p>
		<p>"Dawson?" Mitch's voice sounded cautiously through the wood. "Pacey's on the phone for you." Dawson groaned, but he was relieved that his dad had knocked, as he and Joey still hadn't exactly cemented the habit of locking the door behind them.</p>
		<p>"Thanks, Dad," he called back, and reached across Joey to pick up the receiver. "What's up, Pace?"</p>
		<p>"Dawson, I'm glad you're home," Pacey gushed eagerly. "You're not gonna believe this, but I, Pacey Whitter, the official town loser and no-good do nothing, have fixed the bad-luck truck!" His voice radiated energy even over the phone, and Dawson tried to listen to him with the responsiveness that he deserved, but...it was awfully hard to concentrate while Joey doing that to his ear...</p>
		<p>"Really?" he gasped, sounding surprised, Pacey thought, but definitely in a happy way.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, man, I thought you should be the first to know, since you helped me and all. Wanna go for a spin?"</p>
		<p>"Well, I guess..." Joey was kissing his neck now, and he almost dropped the phone. "How about in an hour, or-- or two, Pace?"</p>
		<p>"Okay, sure, that's good. And you'd better make yourself presentable, my friend, because we are going on the town in style!" Pacey was about to hang up, but then he hesitated. "Hey, Dawson?"</p>
		<p>"Uh-huh?"</p>
		<p>"Is, uh, is Joey there?"</p>
		<p>"Um, yeah." Dawson grew a little red, and Joey looked up from her musings, giving him a questioning look.</p>
		<p>"Could I talk to her a second?"</p>
		<p>Dawson covered the mouthpiece with his hand as he whispered to her, "He wants to talk to you."</p>
		<p>"Why?" she whispered back, making a face. "I'm having fun."</p>
		<p>"I don't know, Joey, just take the phone, okay?" he pushed the receiver into her hand, giving her no choice but to talk or hang up on him, and she wasn't feeling rude enough to do that today.</p>
		<p>"To what do I owe the pleasure?" she asked dryly, as Dawson began what she'd just left off doing to him. Joey let out a little sigh and tried to angle the receiver away from her mouth.</p>
		<p>"Hey, Jo, I was just wondering...your friend Kaela? Well I mean, I just got the truck running, so I was thinking..." Joey knew exactly what he was thinking-- in fact, she was pretty sure at that moment that she knew considerably more.</p>
		<p>"I'm not going to lure her into your den, Pacey," she said, trying to use her most stern voice, which was difficult with Dawson's hands under her shirt.</p>
		<p>"Aw, come on, Joey, I'm not asking you to do that, just show her to the welcome mat! You know, something simple. Like a double date. You'd do that for little old Pacey, wouldn't you? After all, you do owe me about 300 miles on my dad's car, if I remember correctly..." Pacey was determined, and Joey was acutely more interested in ending the conversation quickly than getting her way.</p>
		<p>"Okay, fine," she conceded, having only half a thought of what she'd say to Kaela.</p>
		<p>"Great!" Pacey's excitement was palpable as he did a victory dance in his living room, that, fortunately, only the family dog was privy to. "So tomorrow night, I was thinking? We could all take a scenic drive or something."</p>
		<p>"Sure, sounds good, bye." Joey hung up without waiting for a response, and Pacey hardly seemed to notice he'd been sort of hung-up on. He was already planning his wardrobe for his big night; finally, he could take a girl out in style. Maybe he wasn't destined to be a loser all his life after all.</p>
		<p>Joey, for her part, forgot the entire conversation within the time it took Dawson to unbutton her jeans. He hesitated when it came to actually pulling them off her-- he wasn't sure if he was being too aggressive, or if she wanted him to be? There was only one way to avoid spending all their time in bed second-guessing her.</p>
		<p>"Talk to me, Jo," he whispered close to her ear. "Tell me what you want."</p>
		<p>"I want you to reach into my left pocket and tell me what you find," she whispered back, running her hand up his back as if she'd never known the feel of bare skin before. He complied readily, getting his hand around something he almost couldn't believe. He examined the tiny square package in disbelief. For a moment, everything seemed in place, unreachably perfect, and he was a million miles away, watching.</p>
		<p>"For future reference, you should always check the expiration date," Joey said coyly as he lay grinning at her. "But you don't have to this time-- I just bought it today."</p>
		<p>He broke his grin to kiss her, deeply, maybe the best kiss they'd had yet. This was the no-going-back kiss. After a moment, they pulled apart to attend to a few last-minute details; Joey went and locked the door while Dawson put on some music, hardly caring what it was so long as it was loud enough to give them some cover. Then they both fumbled with what was left of their clothing, so eager they nearly forgot how to undo buttons. Dawson still had the little tin foil package in his hand, and he eyed it nervously, realizing that this was the one thing that was totally foreign to him. Once he opened the package, it would be show time.</p>
		<p>"Are you ready, Joey?" he asked quietly, pulling the blanket over both of them as he brushed her lips with his.</p>
		<p>"You better fucking believe it," she whispered back, hardly able to stay in her skin.</p>
		<p>If he didn't open the damn thing soon, she thought to herself, she'd do it for him. Then again, if she put it on, it would be foreplay, wouldn't it? She took it from his hand before she had the chance to think about it, tearing it open carefully. Then she disappeared under the covers, giggling, and Dawson laid back, letting her take over and enjoying it greatly. A minute later she reemerged, giving him the crooked half-smile that broke his heart every time, it made him love her so much.</p>
		<p>"I want to be on top," she informed him, enjoying her newfound courage to tell him what she wanted without reservation.</p>
		<p>"You've always been on top, Darling," he whispered to her as she climbed over him, their lips and bodies sinking into each other seamlessly.</p>
		<p>Downstairs, Mitch was considering asking them to turn the music down, but as he reached the first step, he suddenly reconsidered. Instead, he headed towards his own bedroom, to find something hidden away in his sock drawer.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>When Dawson unlocked his door, he was surprised to find his father on the other side, his hand raised as if about to knock.</p>
		<p>"Dad! Hey! What's up?" he asked brightly. Mitch looked past Dawson, eying the interior of his room, until Dawson said, "Joey already went home, if that's what you're after."</p>
		<p>He felt like his dad must know, that anyone who saw him would know, as if there were a neon sign emblazoned on his forehead-- but he couldn't have cared less.</p>
		<p>"Dawson, I was just, well, wondering, I suppose...I mean, there's no real official procedure for this, or anything..." Mitch scratched behind his ear, beginning to look a bit bewildered. "Can we have a little talk, man to man?"</p>
		<p>"Sure, Dad, but now's not the best time, I have to go meet Pacey. Later tonight, maybe?" Dawson pulled a sweater on as he spoke, clearly already anticipating an answer.</p>
		<p>"Fine, fine. That should be okay. Let me know when you get home, all right?" Mitch breathed a sigh of relief, realizing he needed more prep than he'd originally thought.</p>
		<p>"No problem," Dawson said absently as he breezed past his father, his thoughts still under the covers.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>By the time Dawson got to Pacey's house, he was glowing like a hundred-watt bulb. All he could think about was how amazing Joey was, how utterly in love with her he was, how he had never felt closer to anyone or anything in his life. His whole house could have blown away right then and there and he'd hardly have cared, as long as Joey hadn't been inside it. He felt as if his very footsteps had changed. He was mid-knock when Pacey threw the door open and jetted past him excitedly. He certainly wasn't one to linger in doorways, Dawson thought.</p>
		<p>"Dawson, are you ready for a night of supreme adventure? We are about to become real men," Pacey grinned, rubbing his hands together.</p>
		<p>"I think I'm ready for just about anything, Pace," Dawson said as they walked toward the truck.</p>
		<p>Pacey eyed him suspiciously. Something was different. The usual glint of angst was not in his eyes, Pacey noted, and his voice lacked its normal tragic complaining tone.</p>
		<p>"Is that so?" he replied inquisitively.</p>
		<p>"Yup." Dawson's face was actually in danger of radiating atomic energy.</p>
		<p>"Okay, man, you are way too sanguine. Give."</p>
		<p>"I don't know what you're talking about," Dawson sighed airily, suggesting that he knew exactly what he was talking about.</p>
		<p>"Oh come one, Dawson, we have known each other way to long for this. You did it with Joey, didn't you? We do have a reason to celebrate tonight!"</p>
		<p>"I've told you before, Pacey, what Jo and I do in bed is private...it's really none of your business."</p>
		<p>"Ah, don't give me that, Bro. Everyone needs someone to talk to about their sex life. I'm sure Joey's going to tell Bessie, or Kaela, or someone, all about it. Process, you know? It's healthy. And we wouldn't want you to be unhealthy, now would we, Dawson...?" Pacey wheedled skillfully around the issue, and Dawson, who was really bursting with ecstasy, couldn't resist.</p>
		<p>"Okay, Pacey, okay. It was incredible."</p>
		<p>Pacey groaned as he started the engine; this was going to take a lot more work than he'd thought. "That's it? Details, Dawson, details! To every story there is a beginning, a middle, and an end--"</p>
		<p>"You're failing English," Dawson pointed out.</p>
		<p>"...so let's start at the beginning. Tell me about the foreplay." He chuckled as they turned onto the main road.</p>
		<p>"Actually," Dawson conceded slyly, "it began right before your phone call." Pacey actually reddened and slapped his forehead in embarrassment.</p>
		<p>"Damn, I knew you were acting weird!" He laughed it off, scratching the back of his neck foolishly. "Well then, take it from there."</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>Kaela opened the door with her three-year-old brother on her hip, happily surprised to see Joey. "Hey, stranger," she grinned, "haven't seen you in hours. Dominick, this is my friend Joey. Do you want to say hi?" The child buried his head against his sister's chest in response, his legs gripping her tightly. "It's okay," she whispered to Joey, "he just takes a little while with new people."</p>
		<p>Joey couldn't help noticing that Dominick was much darker than Kaela-- actually, he was black. Could it be that Bessie and Bodie weren't the only interracial couple in Capeside after all?</p>
		<p>"Hi Kaela, I hope it's not a bad time, or anything..." Joey trailed off as Kaela led her inside grinning.</p>
		<p>"Of course not! I'm always glad to see you, Jo." She put Dominick down in the kitchen, and he immediately ran to the corner, where a play-kitchen was set up, and another slightly older child sat sorting plastic food.</p>
		<p>"That's my sister Eleanor. We call her Elly." Kaela grabbed the little girl from behind, tickling her, until they both fell on the floor laughing.</p>
		<p>"Hi," Elly said through her laughter, addressing Joey much more bravely than her brother had. But, Joey thought, trying not to look as confused as she felt, this little girl had blond hair and blue eyes. How could these three be siblings? Joey decided it would be best not to bring it up in front of the kids.</p>
		<p>"My mom's out, so I'm in charge of these guys, otherwise we could go somewhere," Kaela said apologetically.</p>
		<p>"Oh, no, don't worry about it, I just wanted to ask you something," Joey assured her, as Kaela hunted through the fridge for something to offer. She came out with a Polly-O string cheese in one hand, and a rainbow yogurt cup with sprinkles in the other.</p>
		<p>"Take your pick," she said magnanimously, "we all eat like five-year-olds in this house."</p>
		<p>"That's okay," Joey said shaking her head, "I'm really not hungry."</p>
		<p>Not for food, anyway, she thought to herself, devilishly recalling her recent exploits. They went down the hall to Kaela's room, and the sweet, musty smell of incense hit Joey as soon as she opened the door. The room looked just like the incense smelled, Joey thought-- sweet and mysterious, a bit otherworldly. A richly embroidered tapestry hung over the window, and the walls were painted a cool, minty green color, with dark green borders.</p>
		<p>"Is that from India?" Joey asked, gesturing to the tapestry.</p>
		<p>"No, that's Israeli," Kaela said as she flopped down on her bed, which was on the floor. "My cousin John went backpacking through the Middle East last summer, he brought it back for me."</p>
		<p>"It's beautiful," Joey said, feeling a little awe-struck.</p>
		<p>Going into someone else's room for the first time was always a little like being in a foreign country, but this was like a whole other world. Joey circled the room slowly, examining things. There were several paintings stacked in the corner, facing the wall.</p>
		<p>"I didn't know you were an artist," Joey said admiringly, turning the closest one so she could see it.</p>
		<p>"Don't look at those," Kaela said shyly, jumping up to block Joey's view. "They suck, I just paint for therapeutic purposes."</p>
		<p>Joey managed to get a glimpse of the canvas before Kaela turned it back to the wall, and she recognized it as the fountain at the ruins. The color and light were really superb, she thought, but she knew Kaela was more modest than she ought to be.</p>
		<p>"They don't suck at all, you should hang them in here!" Joey allowed herself to be pulled away from the paintings, back over to the bed.</p>
		<p>"I hope you didn't just come over to give me decorating advice," Kaela teased. "So what's up, anyway?"</p>
		<p>"Well," Joey sighed uncomfortably, "you remember my friend Pacey? He kind of wants to take you out tomorrow night...I mean, I sort of told him we could make it a double date, with me and Dawson-- but you can say no, Pacey's way used to rejection," she assured her, grinning impishly.</p>
		<p>"You don't seem to think much of Pacey, do you?" Kaela observed.</p>
		<p>"It's my job. We're mortal enemies. I get paid by the hour to point out his flaws."</p>
		<p>"In that case, I think you should quit your job at the Icehouse."</p>
		<p>They both laughed, and Joey began to formulate her explanation to Pacey of why Kaela had refused.</p>
		<p>"It was a dumb idea, but he made me promise to ask you..."</p>
		<p>"Sure, I'll go," Kaela offered, surprising Joey greatly.</p>
		<p>"Really?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, why not? You'll be there, won't you? It can't be totally un-fun, and if he tries anything you can protect me."</p>
		<p>"Don't worry about that, I can knock Pacey off his ass with both hands tied behind my back," Joey said proudly. "Been working at it all my life."</p>
		<p>They began to laugh again, then after a moment, Kaela raised one eyebrow suspiciously.</p>
		<p>"There's something else, isn't there?"</p>
		<p>"What do you mean?" Joey asked, unsure.</p>
		<p>"I mean, there's something else on your mind, I just have this feeling like there's something you want to tell. I thought this would be it, but now I don't think it was. What is it?"</p>
		<p>"What are you, telepathic?" Joey blushed, wondering if this was always the way girls' friendships were, and she just never knew it.</p>
		<p>"So there is something,I knew it! C'mon, Jojo, you have to tell me." Her grin was so eager, and Joey was feeling so proud, she didn't need much provocation.</p>
		<p>"Well, I just came from Dawson's..." she reddened so much that no further explanation was really needed, but Kaela wouldn't let her off the hook that easily.</p>
		<p>"So, tell me what happened!"</p>
		<p>"Only what I've been waiting for for fifteen years!"</p>
		<p>"Sorry, Jo, that doesn't cut it. I'm gonna need some graphics."</p>
		<p>Joey's eyes widened, she was still pretty shy when it came down to it, but she took a deep breath and decided it was definitely time to say it out loud.</p>
		<p>"I had sex with Dawson." Those five little words seemed to contain all her vital energy, and once she uttered them, she collapsed backwards on the bed, giggling ecstatically. Then she decided to try it again.</p>
		<p>"I had sex! With Dawson! I, Joey Potter, am no longer a virgin." She basked in the glow of the moment, feeling as if she finally had a pretty good grip on life.</p>
		<p>"Well well, little miss perfect! Congratulations."</p>
		<p>"Thanks," Joey said sheepishly, glancing up at the clock. "Shit! I have to get home, I'm late, I was supposed to be watching Alex." She jumped up and grabbed her shoes, hoping she wasn't making a rude exit.</p>
		<p>"See you tomorrow, Madonna," Kaela teased as Joey put her shoes on quickly. "So what time is this thing, anyway?"</p>
		<p>"Don't know yet, I'll let you know in class tomorrow, okay?" She kissed Kaela on the cheek and ran out the door, praying Bessie was in a good mood.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>It was after midnight when Pacey dropped Dawson off at his house. He slipped out of the truck as quietly as he could, closing the door lightly. "Think Mitch and Gale will be mad?" Pacey asked, hoping his plans for tomorrow night wouldn't be foiled by Dawson's absence.</p>
		<p>"I think it'll be okay, I mean I don't usually go out on school nights, so I'll probably just get a warning or something." He thought to himself that even if he did get in trouble, he might just have to sneak out tomorrow night anyway-- he and Pacey had planned the perfect evening for the four of them, and he didn't want to miss it for anything.</p>
		<p>"All right, see you in the morning, then." Pacey pulled out slowly, trying not to draw any attention to the rattling truck, and drove off. Dawson started towards his door, but then he noticed someone sitting on the dock. it wouldn't be Joey-- she always waited in his bedroom, usually in the closet. He went over to see who it was; after all, it was past midnight.</p>
		<p>"Hey, Jen," he said as he sat down on the dock next to her.</p>
		<p>"Hi Dawson," she responded without missing a beat, as if she had been expecting him. "You just getting home? You're a real wild man now, huh?" she chuckled under her breath, not looking him in the eye.</p>
		<p>"Jen, is something wrong? Why are you sitting out here all alone?"</p>
		<p>Dawson's voice had genuine concern in it; with everything that had been happening lately with Joey, he'd pretty much forgotten about everyone else.</p>
		<p>"It's easier to be lonely," Jen said slowly, "when you're actually alone." She continued to stare out at the water, her eyes focused on some far away point.</p>
		<p>"I know I haven't been the greatest friend lately, Jen, and I'm sorry," Dawson offered humbly. "I'm always here for you, though, you know that."</p>
		<p>"That doesn't mean anything, Dawson." Jen's voice trembled slightly, and he thought she might be crying, but he couldn't really see her face. "You're here, but you're not really *here*. You're in bed with Joey." She wiped her eyes against the back of her hand quickly, pretending to have an itch, or something under her eyelid.</p>
		<p>"Jen, come on, this isn't fair. You've got to move on, that's all! Yes, I'm in love with Joey, but that doesn't mean I regret my relationship with you, or that I don't still care about you." Dawson felt a warmth spreading through his chest as he spoke; he realized he'd never said he was in love with Joey out loud before.</p>
		<p>"I've said all those lines before, Dawson, they don't work on me. I've been around the block too many times."</p>
		<p>"Well," Dawson rebuked her, "you obviously haven't been around this block yet, because you can't recognize honesty when you hear it. Good night, Jen."</p>
		<p>He got up from his spot on the dock and headed for the ladder to his room. Jen sat motionless, letting a tear fall freely off her cheek now that Dawson was gone. What was she doing? She knew it was only making things worse, but she was being honest about how she felt. Now she was going to wreck things not only with Dawson, but with Joey, too-- and she had just finally admitted that she cared about having Joey's friendship. She wondered to herself why her parents had ever sent her here; nothing was different except the height of the buildings. She took a tiny bottle of Tequila out of her pocket and downed it quickly, feeling the familiar warm sensation followed by a welcoming numbness.</p>
