<!-- Rites of Passage \ Chapter 5: Use Your Illusion -->

<p>"Stop being a goof, Kaela," Joey ordered as Kaela decorated her face with smears of sparkling blue body glitter from her secret "outrageousness emergency" stash. "The boys will be here in fifteen minutes!"</p>
		<p>"Who's goofing?" Kaela asked innocently as she turned to Joey with incandescent eyelids and lips. "This is how I'm going." She grinned and waved a gob of the shiny gel at Joey, her eyebrow going up-- which Joey knew by now meant she was thinking something evil.</p>
		<p>"Oh no you don't. Stay away from me!" Joey jumped up from the bed but not in time to avoid Kaela's wrath, and she ended up with some sort of tribal-disco marks on her cheeks and nose. "Now you're really going to die!" Joey laughed as she pinned Kaela down and tickled her neck until she begged for mercy. Out of breath from laughing, they both collapsed on Joey's bed to compose themselves.</p>
		<p>"Well that was a real time saver," Kaela observed with an edge of sarcasm.</p>
		<p>"Hey, who started it?" Joey threw back, giggling.</p>
		<p>"Why, not little old me," Kaela insisted, putting on a southern belle accent as she pouted her lips.</p>
		<p>"Okay, truly, we have to stop. I need to wash my face now, you're on your own miss body glitter." Joey got up and headed towards the bathroom. She pulled her hair back and splashed water on her face quickly, hoping to be ready before the doorbell rang.</p>
		<p>Pacey checked himself out in the rearview mirror one more time as the truck pulled up in front of Joey's house. "What do you think, Dawson?" he asked nervously.</p>
		<p>"I think you'd better stop eyeballing yourself every thirty seconds in that thing, or we won't live to see Providence. You look stylish and debonair, okay?" The two grinned at each other as they got out and headed towards the front door.</p>
		<p>"It's just that this feels so...official, and everything. This is a *real* date, Dawson, and I want to carry it off like a real gentleman."</p>
		<p>Pacey's voice didn't have a note of its usual sarcasm, and Dawson was impressed that he was taking this all so seriously. Lucky for him, he was past the constant nervousness stage with Joey-- not that he didn't have a certain fluttering sensation somewhere in his own stomach...</p>
		<p>"Don't worry, Pace, ten bucks says she'll jump you before the night's over."</p>
		<p>"Have you no dignity, Dawson?" Pacey frowned at him with an air of mock indignance. "Just because you haven't had any in, what, twenty-four long hours? Poor baby..." Dawson was about to give a slightly rude reply when the door opened, with Bessie smiling at them on the other side.</p>
		<p>"Hi boys, come on in, I think they need a few more minutes." Bessie led Dawson and Pacey into the house, thinking how quickly the little boys who'd chased Joey down the hall with frogs from the back yard had grown into these handsome young men. She sighed quietly to herself, hoping Alexander wouldn't grow up quite as fast.</p>
		<p>"So where are you guys going tonight, anyway?" Bessie asked as she offered them each a soda.</p>
		<p>"It's a surprise," Dawson explained, "so you'll have to ask Joey when she gets home." He grinned as he thought of how Joey had pouted when he wouldn't tell her their destination, and how well she'd tried to "coax it out of him." But, to his credit, he hadn't budged, and then she'd been too riled up to break it off, so he got his reward anyway. He tried not to blush in front of Bessie.</p>
		<p>"We're almost ready!" Joey called down the hall, followed by a muffled burst of giggling. Dawson was glad Joey had gotten so close with Kaela; it was good for her to have some girl friends, and besides, she did need someone other than Dawson who she could really talk to, and Pacey didn't quite fit the bill.</p>
		<p>The three of them continued to make small talk for a few minutes more, until Joey and Kaela emerged from the depths. Dawson had instructed them that it was casual attire, but these days that still left a lot of leeway for...variations. Dawson thought momentarily that he ought to ask Pacey to drop him and Joey off at the nearest motel, and pick them up on the way back. Joey looked like a goddess. Her hair was pulled up into a twist, with one little strand falling over her cheek by her ear, and she was wearing a tight skirt, very un-Joey like, but a welcome change of pace. Her blue sweater was a bit on the short side, and exposed just enough skin to get Dawson's imagination going. He swallowed the lump in his throat as he stood up.</p>
		<p>Pacey, meanwhile, was having similar thoughts of his own. He still wasn't sure how Kaela felt about him; she was always nice to him when the four of them were together, but maybe she just didn't want to be rude to Joey's friends? Maybe she only laughed at all his jokes because she thought he was a real idiot. Maybe he should stop staring...but he'd never seen anything like her before. She was a real non-conformist, not a poser like most of Capeside. He thought that she'd probably never been to the Gap in her life, and it didn't bother him one bit. She was wearing a pair of jeans that were torn in some wonderful places, obviously not on purpose, but through constant wearing, and a long-sleeved waffle shirt that had a sort of low neck, which led him to notice the red glass bead around her neck on a pink ribbon. It really focused his attention, which was strange since he usually couldn't tear his gaze away from her eyes. They were so clear, they seemed to see more than normal eyes. But this bead had the opposite effect-- it made him feel like he could see a little into her.</p>
		<p>"Wow," Dawson and Pacey both said at once, under their breath. Joey kissed Dawson lightly on the cheek, while Kaela held back a bit.</p>
		<p>"Hey Pacey," she said, enthusiastically enough. "Sorry we kept you waiting."</p>
		<p>"We'd have waited a lot longer, believe me," Pacey said, taking a risk by kissing the back of her hand. She grinned shyly before pulling her hand away to get her coat.</p>
		<p>"Remember," Bessie said as the four of them made their way outside, "home by midnight."</p>
		<p>"Two," Joey said boldly.</p>
		<p>"One."</p>
		<p>"Deal." Joey smirked as she kissed Bessie goodbye, wondering why they always had to haggle, but feeling like she was getting quite good at it.</p>
		<p>When they got to the truck, they discovered it was a tight squeeze for four across the front seat, so Dawson suggested that Joey sit on his lap.</p>
		<p>"Are you sure about that?" Pacey asked. "It's going to be a long drive," he reminded him.</p>
		<p>"How long?" Kaela implored. "Can't you tell us where we're going now?"</p>
		<p>Dawson and Pacey looked at each other questioningly.</p>
		<p>"They'll probably figure it out once we get onto the highway anyway," Pacey pointed out, and Dawson agreed.</p>
		<p>"We are going," Dawson said dramatically, "to the Fire and Water festival."</p>
		<p>"In Providence?" Joey gasped. "That's over an hour away, Dawson!"</p>
		<p>"That's the beauty of modern technology, Jo," Dawson smiled at the truck as he kissed her behind her ear, which never failed to draw her attention.</p>
		<p>"I've heard it's really cool," Kaela said excitedly as they piled in, Joey ending up on Dawson's lap after all, and Kaela in the middle between them and Pacey. "They just had Waterplace park redone last year, it's supposed to be great." She pinched Pacey's arm playfully. "Was this your idea, brainiac?"</p>
		<p>"Ow," Pacey lamented with mock pain. "And this is how you thank me?" They laughed as Pacey started the car.</p>
		<hr></hr>
		<p>By the time they got off 95, they were all pretty hungry, and agreed to stop somewhere for dinner. Since the festival went all night, there was no rush. None of them really knew their way around, so they just drove up the street that the highway led onto. There seemed to be a lot of restaurants right there, so they parked and got out to explore.</p>
		<p>"How about the Z-Bar?" Pacey suggested, pointing across the street. "That looks cool and trendy, huh?"</p>
		<p>"Oooh, there's a Japanese place up there," Kaela said excitedly, looking up the hill.</p>
		<p>"How do you know it's Japanese?" Pacey asked skeptically.</p>
		<p>"Um, because it's called Tokyo?" Kaela grinned with an edge of sarcasm. She had definitely been spending too much time with Joey, Pacey thought. But he wanted her to have a good time, and he was man enough for some raw fish, wasn't he?</p>
		<p>"Okay, sure, does that sound good to you guys?" he offered to Dawson and Joey. Dawson agreed, but Joey was somewhat reticent.</p>
		<p>"I don't know, I'm not so good with exotic stuff...and I doubt they serve tartar sauce in that place."</p>
		<p>"Come on, Jojo, expand your horizons!" Kaela implored. "It's my favorite, you'll love it. I promise." Kaela was pulling Joey up the hill with one hand, already anticipating success. Joey relented, much to Dawson's surprise. She'd never even had Chinese until 8th grade, he remembered, and she hadn't been too enthusiastic about that either.</p>
		<p>"I can't believe you let her call you Jojo," Dawson said as they made their way toward the restaurant. "I tried that once and you punched me in the stomach."</p>
		<p>"Dawson, that was the fifth grade," Joey said, rolling her eyes. "And you were teasing me."</p>
		<p>"I was not," Dawson huffed with mock indignance.</p>
		<p>"Well I apologize for punching you five years ago, okay?" She stopped and put her arms around Dawson's neck. "Do you forgive me?"</p>
		<p>"Gee, I don't know," Dawson mused. Joey leaned into him and planted a kiss on him lips, gliding her tongue over his teeth. Then she pulled back and looked at him expectantly. "One more of those and you're off the hook."</p>
		<p>Dawson laughed as Joey pushed him away with a sly smile, keeping the upper hand as usual.</p>
		<p>"Don't push your luck."</p>
		<p>The restaurant was crowded, but they were seated quickly. They had to take off their shoes before they entered the dining room, where the tables were low and the seats were cushions. When they sat down, the hostess brought them a basket full of hot towels to wash their hands.</p>
		<p>"This is pretty cool," Pacey said as he surveyed his surroundings. "Not your average fish 'n chips place, but it has a certain charm..."</p>
		<p>Kaela gave his shoulder a playful whack, reprimanding his cockiness. "Give it a chance, will you?"</p>
		<p>"I said I would, didn't I?" They looked over their menus carefully, all of them electing cooked dishes except Kaela.</p>
		<p>"You're really going to eat raw fish?" Joey asked incredulously.</p>
		<p>"Sure, it's fabulous. And don't say eww, Jo, you've never tried it so you have no conception of what it might be like." Kaela took on a sudden pedantic tone as she lectured her friend on her palate.</p>
		<p>"Yes Ma'am," Joey said seriously, and laughed as Kaela stuck out her tongue.</p>
		<p>"Since this has become a night of adventure," Pacey said mysteriously, "how about topping it off with some Japanese beer?"</p>
		<p>They all looked at him blankly, and he put on a stern, mature face as he whipped out an ID card. "Hi, I'm Doug Whitter, nice to meet you."</p>
		<p>"Pacey!" Joey gasped as the rest of them giggled. "He's going to kill you. Literally! Of all the people whose ID you could steal, you pick the deputy? He'd bust your ass without giving it a second thought."</p>
		<p>Pacey shook his head at Joey's worried expression.</p>
		<p>"It's not like that, Jo. Look, he's never gonna know I have it, because it's outdated-- see? It expired last year, he has a new one, and this picture of him was taken right before he left for college. It's a dead ringer, eh?" Pacey held it up next to his own face and smiled as if he were in a commercial for something. They all had to agree, the resemblance was remarkable.</p>
		<p>"Well," Kaela said, beginning to look at bit sly herself, "if we're going to buy alcohol, don't bother with beer-- we should get Saki."</p>
		<p>"What's that?" Joey asked cautiously, not sure if she could handle another new experience in one night.</p>
		<p>"It's warm rice wine, and it's the traditional drink of friends to salute each other. You know, like it's good luck to drink it in good company."</p>
		<p>"Sounds good to me," Dawson said, still incredulous that Pacey had the balls to do this.</p>
		<p>"Okay," Joey agreed. The waitress came to their table a minute later and they ordered, Pacey looking so calm and debonair that she didn't even ask to see his ID, after all that. When the food came, they all found themselves eyeing Kaela's plate suspiciously.</p>
		<p>"What's that?" Joey asked, pointing to something red.</p>
		<p>"Tuna."</p>
		<p>"And what's that?" She pointed to something white on top of a ball of rice.</p>
		<p>"Squid."</p>
		<p>"Ewww!" Joey shrieked involuntarily, a little disappointed that she hadn't been able to act cooler about it. But raw squid was just more than she could handle.</p>
		<p>"All right, thanks for the editorial, Joey, let's just try the Saki, okay?" Kaela laughed it off even though she was a little irritated that Joey was being so closed minded.</p>
		<p>The Saki was quite a sight, though; it came in a ceramic jug, like a little pot of tea, and they all had tiny mugs which Pacey gallantly poured the steaming wine into.</p>
		<p>"This stuff is strong," Kaela warned them all, "so don't overdo it."</p>
		<p>They clicked their cups together in a toast, and sipped the wine carefully. Joey was surprised to find that she liked it, since she hadn't yet tasted any alcohol she liked-- not that she'd had all that much. But this was...well, she couldn't quite describe it, but it felt nice going down her throat, and it made her stomach feel warm. It made other parts of her feel warm, too, and she bit her lip as she wondered how long it would be until she got Dawson alone.</p>
		<p>They finished their meal in relative peace, the Saki taking the spotlight off Kaela's sushi. When the bill came, Pacey and Dawson tried to pay it, but Kaela and Joey refused.</p>
		<p>"What century do you think this is, Dawson?" Joey said emphatically as they all put in their money. "A man paying for a woman's dinner has some pretty serious sociological implications. It says you're making an investment, that you expect to get some return on it, you know?"</p>
		<p>"I just wanted to be a gentleman, Joey, you know I'd never--"</p>
		<p>"I didn't mean you personally, Dawson, I'm talking about a cultural infrastructure here that we're all part of."</p>
		<p>"Joey," Pacey said dryly, "why are you making me feel like I'm at school?"</p>
		<p>"Sorry if your brain can't handle the overload, I guess you're too caught up in your dissertation thesis to be able to process anything else."</p>
		<p>"Easy, guys," Kaela sighed as she put a hand one each other their shoulders. "If you can't play nice, you have to sit in time out."</p>
		<p>"Sorry 'Mom'," Joey giggled as she gave Kaela a kiss on the cheek.</p>
		<p>"It's hard not to act that way sometimes, with two little kids in the house," Kaela offered by way of apology.</p>
		<p>"You don't have to explain," Pacey said as he steered the group back out to the street. "We act like little kids all day, it's got to kick in eventually."</p>
		<p>By the time they left the restaurant, the sun had gone down, and they could see the torches lighting the way to Waterplace Park, where the festival was going on. Music floated through the evening air toward them, and they strolled happily in the direction of the activity. Dawson put his arm around Joey's shoulder, and she slipped her hand inside his jacket where her cold fingers met his warm back.</p>
		<p>"You are wicked," he whispered to her, and she kissed his ear in response. They began to fall behind a bit, and Kaela and Pacey walked on ahead of them.</p>
		<p>"...So how come you know so much about Japanese food?" Pacey asked, wondering if there was some underground Asian community in Capeside he didn't know about.</p>
		<p>"Oh, my cousin John-- he travels a lot, and he lived in Japan for a few years when I was younger. My mom and I went to visit him for Christmas when I was eight. I just got hooked."</p>
		<p>"Wow, that's cool," Pacey said shaking his head. "The furthest I've ever gotten from Capeside is Pittsburgh." He thought of all the experiences Kaela had had that he couldn't even imagine; he felt a little inadequate for a moment, but then he shook it off.</p>
		<p>"Hey, Pittsburgh's something!" Kaela laughed. "Anyway, you've got plenty of time."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, but the sooner the better. I've got to get away from Capeside, I can never be anything but the town loser there."</p>
		<p>"Don't say that," Kaela said softly, studying his face for a moment. "You're not going to spend the rest of your life in high school, you know. You can do anything you want, and people aren't going to think about what grade you got in sophomore Bio."</p>
		<p>She grinned and he sighed, wishing it were that simple.</p>
		<p>"You know something," he said, "you smile more than anyone else I know." She turned her glance down to her feet shyly, but her smile held its ground. "Really," Pacey persisted, "I don't know what you and Joey have in common."</p>
		<p>"Oh, everything," Kaela mused as she shook her head, her grin getting bigger. "Joey is-- oh, never mind."</p>
		<p>"No, I want to hear what you have to say," Pacey urged, and Kaela sighed, looking up at the starts for a moment.</p>
		<p>"Well, Joey is like someone I always knew, that I was just waiting to meet. Like we were together in a past life or something. I don't know, this is dumb, I just feel like...the day we met was like, 'where have you been all this time, I've been waiting for you'."</p>
		<p>She blushed, and Pacey wasn't quite sure what to say. Luckily, they found themselves standing directly in front of the festival entrance.</p>
		<p>"Hey, here we are," he observed, holding out his arm for her. "Shall we?"</p>
		<p>She nodded, and they made their towards the amphitheater, where there was a band and a beautiful display of burning wire sculptures floating down the river behind it.</p>
		<p>Joey and Dawson hadn't quite made it to the festival yet; they had been side-tracked by a lovely private spot behind the train station on the way. They were making out hungrily in the grass, and might have forgotten to even think of rejoining their friends if they hadn't had a police officer shine his flashlight in their faces.</p>
		<p>"This ain't a motel, you kids move along," he said sounding stern but bored. They were so surprised at being caught that they didn't even acknowledge his existence, but grabbed their jackets quickly and bolted around the building, laughing. When they got back to the street, they stopped to catch their breath, still laughing almost uncontrollably.</p>
		<p>"That was nuts, I feel like a criminal!" Dawson said as he straightened his shirt, which had gotten a bit tousled.</p>
		<p>"It feels kind of good, doesn't it?" Joey said mischievously, taking her time adjusting her own clothes, so as not to look suspicious.</p>
		<p>"You are a little devil, aren't you," Dawson remarked as he circled his arms around her waist for one more kiss before they began walking again.</p>
		<p>"What time is it, anyway?" Joey asked as she took Dawson's hand.</p>
		<p>"Almost eleven."</p>
		<p>"Shit, I hope we can find Kaela and Pacey. I told her she wouldn't have to be alone with him...hope he didn't try anything on her, I'd be forced to go to extreme measures."</p>
		<p>"Relax, Jo, Pacey wouldn't do anything disrespectful. For all his talk, he's a pretty nice guy underneath it all."</p>
		<p>"I'd agree with you, except I'd hate to go on record as saying Pacey's a nice guy..."</p>
		<p>Dawson shook his head and wondered what would happen if Joey and Pacey ever made peace. The sky might come crashing down, Armageddon, who knows?</p>
		<p>"Well we're here, anyway," Dawson noted as they approached the entrance. "Looks pretty cool. You ready?"</p>
		<p>Joey nodded, and they headed over to the lights on the river.</p>
		<p>Pacey and Kaela were indeed alone, but neither one was screaming for help. They sat on the far edge of the stone amphitheater, away from the crowd, trying out a few introductory kisses. Without putting too much thought into it, Pacey was pretty sure he liked what was going on, but after a minute Kaela pulled away.</p>
		<p>"What's wrong?" Pacey asked, licking his lips nervously, hoping he didn't taste gross.</p>
		<p>"Nothing," Kaela said sadly, which confused Pacey a bit. "Nothing is wrong...so why isn't anything right?"</p>
		<p>Pacey didn't respond, he just looked at her to communicate his intentions to listen. She met his eyes for a moment, and her own eyes welled up with tears.</p>
		<p>"You're a great guy, Pacey," she said quietly, her voice a little wobbly. "I mean, you're funny, and intelligent, and you listen..." her voice trailed off and Pacey's heart sank as he thought of all the times he should have gone to the gym.</p>
		<p>"What the hell is the matter with me?" She whispered.</p>
		<p>"Nothing's the matter with you, Kaela," Pacey said finally, betraying his confusion. "I don't understand-- I mean, I want to understand...you can trust me, you know."</p>
		<p>"You don't really, you don't want to know," she said shakily as she wiped her eyes on the back of her sleeve. "You'd probably hate me, and I wouldn't blame you."</p>
		<p>"Look, Kaela, I know we don't really know each other that well, but I like you-- I mean I don't just like you because you're beautiful, I like you as a person, you know, as a friend. The only thing you could say that would make me hate you would be that you hate me, so if you're not going to say that, then I can handle it."</p>
		<p>He smiled encouragingly at her, but this time she couldn't smile back. She just kept staring at her hands, nervously turning her thumb ring around her finger.</p>
		<p>"I thought..." she said quietly, almost whispering, "if I could just go along doing the things girls do, normal things, that it would just go away...shit, Pacey, I can't believe I'm telling you this."</p>
		<p>Pacey didn't say anything, as he began to realize what they were really talking about.</p>
		<p>"I've never said this out loud before."</p>
		<p>"You still haven't," he said gently. She looked up at him, and he saw that the tears in her eyes had spilled over down her cheeks, with new ones on the way.</p>
		<p>"I like hanging out with you, Pacey, and I like talking to you, and all of that...so why don't I like this?"</p>
		<p>"It's hard," Pacey said as he squeezed her hand, "to kiss someone when you're thinking of someone else."</p>
		<p>"What if that someone else is Joey?" She whispered, her eyes squeezed shut.</p>
		<p>"Then I'd tell you I've been there before, and there's not much hope."</p>
		<p>Kaela's mouth betrayed her in the beginning of a smile, even though the rest of her face was filled with misery and embarrassment.</p>
		<p>"It's not the same, Pacey, and you know it."</p>
		<p>"No, it's not," Pacey agreed, "but I'll tell you the same thing I tell my closet case brother every day-- it's not the end of the world to be gay."</p>
		<p>She looked up at him quickly, her eyes registering shock for a moment before she buried her face in her hands.</p>
		<p>"God, I hate that word," she mumbled through her tears. "it's almost as bad as..." She trailed off and he finished her sentence.</p>
		<p>"Lesbian?"</p>
		<p>He watched her eyebrows knit into a hateful expression that had seemed so foreign to her an hour ago.</p>
		<p>"All I can think of is women with shaved heads and leather jackets...ugh, I don't want to be that, Pacey."</p>
		<p>"You're not that, not at all, and I can't think of any reason why you should try to be."</p>
		<p>He took both her hands in his, forcing her to come out of hiding and look at him. "Who you love doesn't change who you are, you know...you're the same person you always were."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I guess I was always fucked in the head."</p>
		<p>"Jesus, Kaela, don't say that! I know Capeside isn't exactly overflowing with gay culture or role models, but...but you've been all over the world, don't you know it's not seen as such a bad thing anymore?"</p>
		<p>"I don't know, Pacey, some places more than others, it's just...I don't know, she'd hate me if she knew, that's what counts."</p>
		<p>"No she wouldn't," Pacey said firmly. "Look, if I don't get through to you about anything else, I've got to get you to listen to this. Joey is the most caring person I know, not that I know too many other caring people. I've known her all my life, and she'd never turn on anyone she cares about. She knows what it feels like to be abandoned. I've seen you together," Pacey said as he took her chin in his hand, making her look at him. "And I know she cares about your friendship."</p>
		<p>She looked back down at the ground as soon as Pacey let go of her chin. He'd never imagined that this girl who seemed to be filled with sunshine and understanding could have such terrible self-esteem.</p>
		<p>"So you don't hate me?" she asked weakly, her eyes imploring.</p>
		<p>"Of course not, Kaela, I just never thought I'd be so jealous of Joey."</p>
		<p>He got a small grin out of her that time, but it was fleeting. "So when are you going to tell her?"</p>
		<p>"Never!" she said hotly, her cheeks flushed with shame. "Pacey, if you say one word, I swear--"</p>
		<p>"Relax, I won't say anything to anyone, I'd never betray your trust, Kaela."</p>
		<p>Pacey was shocked to see the fear in her eyes.</p>
		<p>"...Thanks," she sighed, catching her breath in her throat. "You really are a pretty great person, you know, Pacey," she said as she hugged him.</p>
		<p>He hugged her back, hoping if she couldn't believe his words, he could still show her that he was there for her.</p>
		<p>"Too bad neither of us can compete with Dawson."</p>
		<p>She pulled away and Pacey wiped a few tears off her cheek.</p>
		<p>"You know, it's never going to get any easier," Pacey said delicately, "unless you talk about it. With Jo, I mean. Crushes suck, it's like they eat you up inside if you don't let them out. Maybe you're not ready yet, but soon you will be. You'd be surprised..."</p>
		<p>She nodded, taking a deep breath and trying to pull herself together. Suddenly, they both looked up and noticed Joey and Dawson walking toward them.</p>
