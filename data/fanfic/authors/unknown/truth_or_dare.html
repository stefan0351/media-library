<!-- Truth or Dare \ Story -->

<p>Willow and Buffy made their way through Xander's house,
trying to get to the entrance to his "apartment" in the basement.</p>
<p>"I can't believe we're gonna do this." Buffy said, shaking
her head. "Fifth graders. We've reverted back to fifth graders."</p>
<p>"We're doing this to help him. And you're one to talk, Cave
Girl." Willow said shifting her backpack to a better position on her
shoulder.</p>
<p>Buffy hid her embarrassment, and continued her objection.
"He's not going to -"</p>
<p>"He will."</p>
<p>As Willow reached down for the knob to open the basement
door, Buffy grabbed her free shoulder. She turned to face her. </p>
<p>"What did you do?"</p>
<p>Willow grinned, and started to walk down the stairs, with a
suspicious Buffy, following.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>What she didn't tell Buffy was that she had cast a spell on
Xander. No, not a love spell. It was a truth spell. She could undo it any time
she wanted to, but she had a plan. Xander had been hiding behind his humor, and
she was sick of it.</p>
<p>Well, he always did, but it was more so now because of his
different lifestyle. He didn't see them that often, but when he did, he always
kept himself hidden from them. Willow knew he wouldn't voluntarily tell them the
truth, so she was going to make him.</p>
<p>She knew it was somewhat wrong, but both she and Buffy
wanted to help him, and make him feel better. And they wouldn't know how to do
that until he started honestly talking to them.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>They saw him lying on the bed, watching a small portable TV.
He looked to be in deep concentration. </p>
<p>"Elmo is confused. If A comes before B…" The TV spewed
out.</p>
<p>He looked over at them, noticing their presence for the
first time. He quickly switched it off.</p>
<p>"Hey guys. What's up?"</p>
<p>"Oh…nothing really. What were you watching, Xander?" Buffy
asked.</p>
<p><i>'Yes! This is the perfect test.' </i>Willow
thought.</p>
<p>"Documentary. On…the…Alamo. Confusing as it was."</p>
<p>Willow frowned. Another spell that didn't work.</p>
<p>"Really? Just so you know, C comes after B." She said
jokingly.</p>
<p>"Another point for the Slayer's sarcasm. What can I help you
ladies with?"</p>
<p>They both looked to Willow.</p>
<p>"Oh…we were…going to play…Truth or Dare."</p>
<p>"Ooh. I'm always up for a game of T or D. Such
possibilities." He grinned, and tried to look seductive.</p>
<p>"Before Casanova gets too carried away…what's the plan,
Will?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>They were sitting on the floor, in a circle. And Buffy drew
a piece of paper out of a hat Willow had in her bag.</p>
<p>"See this is how it should be. The original gang. No
Cordelia, no -" Xander started. Buffy narrowed her eyes at him. "Oh…sorry,
Will."</p>
<p>"It's okay." She looked at her feet, and Buffy put her hand
on Willow's shoulder, and gave her the paper. She smiled. "You go first cause
you picked the smallest number, Buffy." Willow said, smiling back.</p><i>
<p></i>"Let's see. Xander, truth or dare?"</p>
<p>"Truth."</p>
<p>"Are you okay?"</p>
<p>Xander looked surprised, and Willow got hopeful. "You bet."
Buffy and Willow both frowned. "Okay, Buff…truth or dare?"</p>
<p>"Dare." She said quickly.</p>
<p>"I dare you to remove a piece of your attire."</p>
<p>Buffy grinned at him, and then removed one of her sneakers.
Xander looked disappointed. Heartbroken.</p>
<p>"New rule. You can't use the same dare more than once,"
Willow said looking at Xander, "and you can't take two dares in a
row."</p>
<p>Buffy seemed worried, but then realized it was once again
her turn, and looked at Willow. "Truth or Dare?"</p>
<p>"Umm…dare."</p>
<p>Buffy thought. "I dare you to…use bad English."</p>
<p>"That…ain't…" Willow hesitated, and Buffy moved her hand in
a 'come on' gesture. "…Not no problem."</p>
<p>"There. That wasn't so bad was it?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"You're next, Buffy. Truth or Dare?"</p>
<p>"Truth. No. Dare." Why'd she say truth? She didn't want
truth. Did she?</p>
<p>"You said truth first. Anyway, you can't have two dares in a
row. Do I have to repeat the rules?" Buffy shook her head, a little frightened.
"Do you like someone?"</p>
<p>"Yes." Buffy said slowly. "Truth or Dare…Xander."</p>
<p>"Dare."</p>
<p>"I dare you to…smell my foot."</p>
<p>"Gladly." Buffy held out her sock-covered foot, and he
sniffed. "Whew! Have you ever heard of soap?" She lightly kicked his forehead.
"Buffy, Truth or Dare?"</p>
<p>"Truth." <i>'Damn it, Buffy! Stop saying
that!'</p></i>
<p>"Do we know the person?"</p>
<p>"The person who?"</p>
<p>"Don't avoid, Buffy." Willow said.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Okay, it's my turn."</p>
<p>"I don't think so." Xander said.</p>
<p>"That's right. You didn't answer right away. You lose a
turn."</p>
<p>"I never heard that."</p>
<p>"It's Rosenberg rules."</p>
<p>"Not following them leads to consequences. Trust me." Xander
said, remembering.</p>
<p>"Fine." Buffy said, defeated.</p>
<p>"It's a truth. You don't have a choice. Is it Riley?" Willow
asked.</p>
<p>"Nope."</p>
<p>"Not Parker, right?"</p>
<p>Buffy didn't care if she didn't have to answer. "No
way."</p>
<p>"Good." Xander said.</p>
<p>"Now is it my turn?" They nodded. "Truth or Dare,
Willow."</p>
<p>"Truth."</p>
<p>"Ever thought about anybody…besides Oz, and Xander?" It was
time to turn the tables.</p>
<p>"Sometimes." <i>'Nice save, Willow.' </i>"Truth or Dare,
Buffy?"</p>
<p>"Tell me what the truth is first."</p>
<p>"I think I can bend the rules a little. The truth will be:
Who is it?"</p>
<p>"Dare."</p>
<p>"I dare you to answer the truth."</p>
<p>"That's evil, Will." Xander said.</p>
<p>"That was, wasn't it?" Buffy looked relieved. She thought
Willow was going to take it back. "But she still has to answer."</p>
<p>Buffy closed her eyes, and took a deep breath.
"You."</p>
<p>"Me?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>"No…me." Willow clarified, with wide eyes.</p>
<p>"Why did I say that? I didn't want to say that!" Buffy
nearly screamed.</p>
<p>"Back up a minute. You like…" Xander trailed off.</p>
<p>"Willow. Okay? I don't just like her, I love her. A lot. I
wanted to kill Oz for hurting her, and I wanted to keep holding her, tell her,
and then kiss her -" She put her hand over her mouth to stop herself.</p>
<p>Willow was still silent. She got a book out of her bag, and
started flipping through it. Buffy's eyes narrowed in on it.</p>
<p>"That's a spell book isn't it? Willow!"</p>
<p>She didn't answer. She was reading in the book, looking at
the spell she used. </p>
<p><i>'I translated right…here…and here…oh no.'</p>
<p></i>She looked at the title of the spell again. It was in
Latin. Roughly translated it said: How To Make the One You Love Truthful to
You.' How did she miss that? There were too many truth spells; she must have
picked the wrong…she looked up at Buffy, who had a worried look on her
face.</p>
<p>"Call me slow…but…Buffy…" Xander tried again.</p>
<p>"Loves me. And…I kinda love her back."</p>
<p>Buffy looked up. She seemed so vulnerable.</p>
<p>"Kinda?"</p>
<p>"I do. I really do. I just never…thought…about…"</p>
<p>"Well, come on." Xander said.</p>
<p>"Come on what?" They both asked.</p>
<p>"You're not going to make me dare, are you? Cause I don't
think I have to."</p>
<p>He saw their looks. "Fine. I'll turn around. Just because
every male fantasy…"</p>
<p>Buffy and Willow scooted closer together.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you tell me?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you…oh…sorry. I'm stupid."</p>
<p>Willow brushed a stray hair behind Buffy's ear. "No, you're
not. Far from it."</p>
<p>"Is your head still turned?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"How much is it worth to you?" Xander retorted.</p>
<p>"Xander!" They both yelled.</p>
<p>"Geez. It is. Just hurry up, will ya? I don't know how much
longer I can keep my testosterone in check."</p>
<p>They both grinned at the remark, and leaned in. Lips
meeting, they tested each other at first. Both finding no resistance, they
allowed their tongues to part open each other's mouths, and kissed fully.
Sweetly.</p>
<p>They broke apart, trying to breathe.</p>
<p>"You can turn around now, Xander." Willow said.</p>
<p>They both looked, and saw that he had already been facing
their direction.</p>
<p>"Not one word outta you. Got it?" Buffy said, and Xander
nodded slowly. She turned away from him and then to Willow who smiled, and then
tilted her head in their friend's direction. "Okay, Xand. We fessed up. Your
turn. And no game this time."</p>
<p>As Buffy grasped Willow's hand, she thought fifth grade
games weren't so bad anymore. She couldn't wait to play Spin the
Bottle.</p>
<p>She was pretty sure you could play with two
people.</p>
