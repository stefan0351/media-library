<!-- Was it Just a Kiss? \ Part 2 -->

<p>Harry practically fainted. Tom's eyes bugged out of his head as his libido perked up. With a huge grin he grabbed Harry and dragged him out into the corridor, leaving the two ladies alone. "Well, it seems we have outstayed our welcome Harry. Come on, let's leave these two." Tom dragged a bumbling Harry through the door. </p>
<p>"B..bu....but....," Harry stuttered. </p>
<p>Tom shook his head. "Sorry buddy, I didn't realize she and B'Elanna were dating. I mean I knew they were close, but I didn't realize how close." Harry just continued to stand there staring at the closed door until Tom poked and prodded him down the hall towards their own cabins. </p>
<p>Back inside, aware that the guys had left, Seven released B'Elanna. B'Elanna just stood there, mouth open, staring at Seven. When Seven first grabbed her she had been shocked, but after a nanosecond of those soft lips hitting her she hadn't been aware of anything other than the delicious feel of Seven's lips against her own. Time had stopped for her until Seven broke the kiss. Even then she couldn't do anything other than stare at Seven, jaw practically hitting the floor. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry... I.... " Seven realized what she had done. B'Elanna was just staring at her, mouth open. This only made Seven more nervous and concerned about just what B'Elanna might be thinking. Instead of staying and explaining what prompted the kiss, Seven bolted. She practically ran back to her recently assigned quarters to regenerate in her new portable unit that she and B'Elanna had created together. Regeneration always gave her a sense of calm peace. She was sure that would make everything better. </p>
<p>B'Elanna on the other hand was still standing, rooted in place. </p>
<p>"What..." </p>
<p>"Who..." </p>
<p>The feel of those lips on hers was still playing through her mind. </p>
<p>Finally she realized she was alone and that everyone had left. For the life of her she couldn't figure out what had prompted the kiss or the hasty departure. B'Elanna considered going after Seven and asking what was going on, but since Seven had left in a hurry she thought maybe Seven had decided the kiss was a mistake and she didn't want to pressure her. Instead she just turned in early, though she couldn't stop thinking of that kiss throughout the entire night. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The next day B'Elanna still couldn't get that kiss out of her head. She wanted to approach Seven and talk to her about it, but had pressing things in Engineering to take care of first. So she so headed off towards her beloved warp core instead. </p>
<p>Regeneration had brought Seven no peace. She completed her regeneration cycle as conflicted as when she started it. She knew she had to find B'Elanna and tell her about what had occurred. She made the decision to find her for lunch and tell her what was going on. That decision made, Seven felt considerably better and left to start her day in Astrometrics. </p>
<p>Before the Captain's enforced holiday time for the crew, everybody was busy doing much need repairs and upgrades. The mandatory leave time was supposed to start in two days and rotation shifts had been set up so that only about half the crew was on leave at any given point over the next seven days. Each person would have three consecutive days off. Everyone was making plans with what to do with their down time and with whom to spend it. </p>
<p>Chakotay figured he would do a little camping and thought it might be the perfect opportunity to spend a little time with Seven. Chakotay fancied himself a sensitive guy and thought he had a good chance of getting Seven to go out on a date with him. The fact that he was also placing bets on himself in the pool going around had nothing to do with it. really. This was all just for Seven's sake... right? </p>
<p>As lunchtime for the Alpha shift neared, Chakotay excused himself from the bridge and made his way down to Astrometrics, flowers in hand, to ask Seven if she would accompany him to dinner during her leave. So what if he was planning on that dinner being at his campsite, in the middle of nowhere, with no one around for miles. A guy can have aspirations can't he? When Chakotay walked into Astrometrics, he was quite disappointed to find it very empty. Not a Borg in sight. </p>
<p>"Computer, locate Seven of Nine." </p>
<p>/Seven of Nine is in turbo lift two./ </p>
<p>"Wonder where she is heading?" </p>
<p>/Please restate your question./ </p>
<p>"Never mind." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>A few minutes earlier in Astrometrics, Seven had decided to talk to B'Elanna and explain her actions of the previous evening. </p>
<p>"Computer what is the location of Lt. Torres?" </p>
<p>/Lt. Torres is in Engineering./ </p>
<p>Seven left to find B'Elanna and straighten all this out. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Cursing could be heard throughout main engineering. B'Elanna was making a few final upgrades that needed to be done prior to taking her vacation two days from now. She was in the process of rewiring one of the workstations that seemed to explode on a regular basis. She had figured out a way to insulate the circuitry a bit better in hopes that it wouldn't continually explode, sending her and her crewmembers flying across engineering in each and every battle that they participated in. That was getting a little tiring. </p>
<p>However, in her haste to rewire the workstation, she hadn't shutdown the power feeding the panel before opening it. A very entry-level mistake she never should have made, yet her thoughts had been on Seven ever since last night and this was just the latest of several mistakes she had made that day. This one caused her to burn her hand and it just plain hurt. She couldn't quite decide what she was madder at, the fact that her hand hurt or that her daydreaming had caused this accident. </p>
<p>Just then Seven entered Engineering to see if B'Elanna would have lunch with her. She figured she could at least buy her lunch in an effort to apologize for her behavior the night before. All she could think about was that her friend must be horrified that she had kissed her. It never occurred to her that B'Elanna hadn't seemed to mind being kissed by her, and had even seemed to quite like it. So engrossed was she with her thoughts of apology, she almost tripped over the cursing Lieutenant who was lying half under the first workstation in Engineering. Seven immediately noticed the burn mark on the engineer's hand. </p>
<p>"B'Elanna!" Seven tapped her comm. badge, "Seven of Nine to the Doctor, please report to Engineering immediately. Lt. Torres has been injured and requires medical attention." </p>
<p>The Doctor responded that he would be right there. Meanwhile, Seven knelt down next to B'Elanna and cradled her injured hand in her own. "You are injured. What happened? Are you alright?" </p>
<p>"Injured? Really? Hadn't noticed." B'Elanna flippantly replied, still cursing her own stupidity. "Just a stupid mistake Seven. Forgot to turn the power off before uncoupling the conduit. It is just a small burn. I'll be fine." </p>
<p>"That is very unlike you. Is everything alright.... aside from the obvious injury?" </p>
<p>Just then, Chakotay, who had been following Seven in hopes of asking her out, arrived in Engineering followed closely by the Doctor. What he found was B'Elanna on the floor with Seven on one knee in front of her, cradling her hand. Chakotay still had the flowers for Seven in his hand. Seven took one look at his face in addition to the flowers in his hand and put two and two together. Again. she panicked. She turned her head and looked B'Elanna in the eyes and did the first thing she thought of... </p>
<p>She kissed her. </p>
<p>Again. </p>
