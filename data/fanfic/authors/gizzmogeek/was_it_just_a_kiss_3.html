<!-- Was it Just a Kiss? \ Part 3 -->

<p>Chakotay stopped dead in his tracks, the grin disappearing from his face while his jaw dropped in shock. This was the very last thing he expected to see. He backed up a step and ran right into the EMH, knocking them both down and sending the flowers skittering across the floor. Chakotay picked himself up and excused himself from Engineering, leaving the Doctor on his rump with his jaw hanging open, staring at the two women kissing in front of him. </p>
<p>Seven regained her senses a little quicker this time and stopped kissing B'Elanna but did make one mistake before fleeing the scene yet again. She looked into her eyes and was caught for a moment by the depths she saw there. B'Elanna did not come to quite that fast and was still lost in the moment. Again Seven got up and rushed out of Engineering before she could stammer a single thing. The engineer was left to contemplate the look she had just seen in Seven's eyes... what was that she had just seen? Confusion, fear, passion? Now she really had to find out what was going on with Seven. </p>
<p>Yet before B'Elanna could get up and chase Seven down the hall, the Doctor had snapped out of it and pushed her back down to tend to her hand. Of course, being the gossip hound that he was, he couldn't help but ask her about what he had witnessed. </p>
<p>"So, Lieutenant, I didn't realize you and Seven were dating. When did that start?" </p>
<p>"I... uh... huh?" B'Elanna brought her free hand to her lips, which still tingled from the recent contact with Seven. </p>
<p>"I see. You know Lieutenant, you should really work on your communication skills." </p>
<p>The Doctor proceeded to heal B'Elanna's hand while she just stared sightlessly past him, obviously lost in thought. Once he was done, B'Elanna got up and shot out of Engineering like a fire had been lit under her boots. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Seven was headed down the corridor at a rapid pace after leaving Engineering. Luckily for her Chakotay had headed off in the opposite direction. </p>
<p>"What have I done now? Instead of explaining matters, I have made them worse. At this rate she will never talk to me again. What is wrong with me?" she lamented. </p>
<p>Seven had made her way to the nearest turbo lift, but she was so lost in her thoughts that she hadn't gotten out at her stop. Instead she was still standing in the turbo lift when the Captain got on the lift on her way to lunch. </p>
<p>She took one look at Seven, heard her muttering to herself and grew concerned. "Seven, are you alright? Is everything ok?" </p>
<p>"Pardon? Oh, excuse me Captain. I apologize. I'm just a little lost in thought." </p>
<p>Before the Captain could respond, the doors opened and B'Elanna got on the lift. She was about to launch into Seven with a thousand questions, but the sight of her Captain in the lift with them halted her tongue. Instead she nodded to both and stood quietly. "Captain, Seven". </p>
<p>Kathryn smiled at B'Elanna and then thought maybe she would ask Seven if she wanted to join her for lunch. She knew something was bothering the Borg and hoped maybe she could get it out of her. It wasn't like Seven to be so obviously out of sorts. </p>
<p>"Seven, I was wondering if you would like to join me for..." </p>
<p>Seven had frozen in place staring at the floor when B'Elanna had entered the lift. She was afraid to look at B'Elanna, expecting to see disgust or anger painting her face. If she had only looked up she would have seen something else entirely. When Kathryn started to invite her to lunch, Seven added two and two again. Sadly she didn't get four this time around. She mistakenly thought Kathryn was going to ask her for a romantic date instead of the friendly lunch Janeway was really suggesting. In keeping with her previous responses to such inquiries, Seven launched herself across the turbo lift, colliding with B'Elanna and enveloping her in yet another kiss. </p>
<p>This time though, B'Elanna wasn't completely caught at a loss. She responded to Seven in every way. B'Elanna wrapped her arms around Seven and kissed her back - passionately. If you had asked her yesterday if she was interested romantically in Seven, B'Elanna probably wouldn't have answered affirmatively. However there was no mistaking the feelings that Seven had stirred within her during the previous two kisses. She definitely had feelings for Seven and they were more than friendship. </p>
<p>"Good Lord! Well now that isn't the response I was expecting." Kathryn almost barked at her two officers to explain themselves, then thought better of it and just left them to their devices. Considering how they usually fought like cats and dogs, this was definitely an improvement. Before she could leave the turbolift though, they broke apart. </p>
<p>Seven was completely lost. The first two times she had kissed B'Elanna she knew she had liked it - more than she ever anticipated - however this time it finally dawned on her that she wasn't the only one enjoying the contact. A low growl escaped from B'Elanna while they were kissing, causing Seven to snap out of it. She broke the kiss and stepped back, staring at B'Elanna intently. </p>
<p>B'Elanna, assuming Seven was going to skip off for a third time, headed off Seven's retreat. </p>
<p>"Computer, Halt Turbolift" </p>
<p>B'Elanna realized the Captain was still in the lift with them. </p>
<p>"Captain, would you mind if Seven and I had a moment alone? We need to discuss a few things." </p>
<p>Kathryn just smirked at her and said, "I bet you do," then promptly left the turbo lift. </p>
<p>B'Elanna turned to a now very confused and nervous Borg and simply stared at her, waiting for her to say something. Seven just stared at the floor, wishing she could melt into the wall and disappear. </p>
<p>"Seven," B'Elanna whispered while taking a step towards her. </p>
<p>Seven looked up and was riveted by what she saw in B'Elanna's chocolate eyes. She didn't see disgust or anger as she expected. What she did see ignited a fire deep within her soul. She saw hunger, acceptance, love and want. It gave her hope. </p>
<p>"Why?" was all B'Elanna could say. </p>
<p>Seven looked down again and sighed. "I'm very sorry Lanna. I hope I didn't offend you." </p>
<p>"You didn't offend me... but ... please... tell me why? I can't take it anymore. I need to know what is going on." </p>
<p>Seven smiled hesitantly. Would her explanation make B'Elanna mad or laugh? There was only one way to find out. </p>
<p>"I have been aware for some time that people were betting on who was going to date me first," Seven started. </p>
<p>"Yeah, I had heard about that. What does that have to do with anything?" B'Elanna leaned against the side of the turbo lift and waited for the explanation. </p>
<p>"Well, last night when we were playing cards I knew Harry was going to ask me out. Tom was prodding him to do so and I just didn't want to go on a date with him. However I also didn't want to hurt his feelings. Harry is a very good friend to me. but that is all he is. I have no romantic feelings for him. When we were playing cards and he started to ask me out, I panicked and did the first thing that came to mind that would stop him from asking me out. The first thing that came to mind was to kiss you." </p>
<p>"But wait..." B'Elanna tried to interrupt. </p>
<p>"Do you want to hear the whole story or not Lanna?" Seven grinned at B'Elanna's furrowed brow. 'She is so cute when she is confused,' Seven thought. </p>
<p>B'Elanna caught Seven's grin, shut-up and smiled back, waiting for her to continue. </p>
<p>Seven sighed. "When I realized what I had actually done, I was scared that I had either angered you or embarrassed you so instead of staying and explaining myself I lost my courage and took off for my quarters. I apologize for that. I intended to rectify the error today by asking you to lunch to explain my actions, but then Chakotay showed up in Engineering before I could talk to you. It looked like he too was going to ask me out, carrying flowers and all, and I overreacted. Before I could even think twice about it I had kissed you again. When I realized what I had done, I again lost my courage and took off. You are obviously aware of where I ended up since you found me here in the turbo lift." </p>
<p>B'Elanna chanced another interruption. "I take it you don't want to date Chakotay either then?" </p>
<p>"Lanna, come on. We are friends are we not?" </p>
<p>"Yeah, of course. Why?" </p>
<p>"Chakotay? Could you wish for a more boring person for me to date? I would sooner date a tree!" </p>
<p>B'Elanna could only laugh at that, which went a long way to lightening the mood. "Yeah, good point. I wouldn't wish that on anyone I suppose. He means well, but yeah he is damn boring. Okay, that explains the first two times. What about just now?" </p>
<p>"Well... there are two explanations for that one. The first was that I thought that Captain Janeway was going to ask me out also. I don't think I have to explain to you how inappropriate that would feel considering she is like a mother to me." </p>
<p>"No, I totally get that, however I don't think she was asking you out," B'Elanna said. </p>
<p>"Yes, well that goes to the second explanation. I used her as an excuse for the opportunity to kiss you again. There is only one person on board that I am interested in dating B'Elanna. You. I kissed you twice and I just couldn't resist doing it again." </p>
<p>Seven paused to gauge B'Elanna's reaction. What she saw in the engineer's eyes gave her hope. </p>
<p>"However, that is my reasoning for kissing you... and unless my recollection is wrong - which it never is - you kissed me back rather nicely this last time... or am I misreading that kiss entirely?" As Seven finished her sentence she stepped up to B'Elanna until she was a mere breath away from her. They were breathing the same air, their lips almost touching, with their eyes drilling into each other. "So ... are you going to tell me why you kissed me back?" </p>
<p>The heat radiated between the two women, only millimeters apart. Seven could here B'Elanna growling by now, very low and very deep in her chest and it answered any doubt she may have had, but she held back waiting for her to verbalize her answer. </p>
<p>"No," Lanna breathed. </p>
<p>"No?" Seven started to step back confused but B'Elanna captured her and flipped her around, effectively pinning her to the wall. "No, I'm not going to explain why I kissed you back. I'm going to show you." With that she crushed her lips to Seven's and they drowned in the sweetness of all that they shared. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Later in the day, in the mess hall, four people were having lunch together while mulling over the events that they had witnessed. The rumors flying around engineering were electric, as they had all witnessed the exchange between the two women. However, Tom, Harry, Chakotay and Kathryn were all questioning what was going on. </p>
<p>"So what do you think is going on?" </p>
<p>"I have no idea. What do you think?" </p>
<p>"I don't have any idea, but I will say the turbo lift has been out of commission for the last hour and no one can get past the Borg encryption codes to fix it." </p>
<p>They all started laughing. "Well, guess that answers that now doesn't it!"  </p>
