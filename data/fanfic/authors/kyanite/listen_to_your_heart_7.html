<!-- Listen to Your Heart \ Chapter VII -->

<p>Sickbay.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>Again?</p>
<p>"Ah, Lieutenant Torres..."</p>
<p>Nononononono.</p>
<p>I open my eyes and see the one enemy of mine that I can't defeat with a Bat'leth.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant how are you today?"</p>
<p>I close my eyes again and manage a groan that even in my own ears only fairly sounds like a weak: "...head...ache...sssss".</p>
<p>My, what happened?</p>
<p>He drugs me and immediately I feel better. I don't say so and I keep my eyes closed. I'm not ino his self-praise right now. Isn't a self-absorbed beam of light a paradox, anyway? My lips are burning as I try to smile. Oh no. This wasn't real, was it?</p>
<p>"Where is she?" I have to know.</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>Oh yes. Please, let this all have been a dream. I'm outta here in no time after the doc prescribed me something against these headaches. And then I'll hunt these bastards down, who dared to insult my daughter and...</p>
<p>"I am here, Lieutenant."</p>
<p>There she is. What's that look in her eyes? Oh no. This can't be true, can it? No. No. No. How in hell could this ever happen...?</p>
<p>I mean...</p>
<p>"Is it true?"</p>
<p>"Lieutenant?"</p>
<p>Hm. maybe not.</p>
<p>"Seven, how did I get here?"</p>
<p>She looks... confused? Oh my. No good sign at all.</p>
<p>"Lietenant, you were transported to sickbay after..."</p>
<p>"Seven cut it. From /where/ was I transported?"</p>
<p>"From your quarters."</p>
<p>Shit. Then... I touch my lips. And my body remembers. This was no dream. But it can't be true. No. Never. I would /never/ survive this. The embarrassment. The weakness I showed her. My innermost thoughts and feelings...<br> Kahless, I feel so exposed. Not at all like a fearless warrior. Where is a targ's earth-hole when you need it? Wouldn't it be for my being half-klingon I bet I'd be burning up into a deep red now.</p>
<p>I notice how my fingers unconsciously trace my lips back and forth.</p>
<p>"Seven...?"</p>
<p>"Lieutenant, I-I assure you, that I - we -..."</p>
<p>Ok. Apparently she doesn't feel any better. But somehow this knowledge doesn't offer satisfaction like it used to. I hear myself interrupting her fiddling, "You didn't call me that for the last 7 weeks..."</p>
<p>"B'Elanna?" Oh this is hilarious. For once her mouth was faster then her superior brain could rein in.</p>
<p>And now... oooooh these eyes. Boy, am I glad I'm already lying on this bed. Son of a targ, how does she do that? Why did I never notice? So long, so long I've been wondering, if she would ever, ever be able to look like that... ... at me. And now that she does,... - my was I blind!<br>I thought I'd be protecting my heart by fighting her off and out of my personal space. How much effort did I put into the attempt to keep my true heart buried under bad temper... And now here she stands, all vulnerable and uncertain, straining to keep the iron control over her body so it wouldn't betray any of her emotions.</p>
<p>She still looks at me.<br>Expectantly.<br>What does she expect? What does she want?</p>
<p>"Seven, I'm sorry."</p>
<p>Hah, greater, still.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna?"</p>
<p>Poor Seven. But I don't know what she wants me to say. Was it real? I mean, I know now that it was real, but was it true...?<br>Was she being true? Wait, she wanted to assure me, that...<br>Can it be? Did she all this only to bring me, my memory, back? Was it mere business for her? Another assignment? The task of the day? Nothing but helping a fellow crewmember? Returning a valuable lost sheep to its herd? Keeping the collective together and at peak efficiency?</p>
<p>Noooooooooooh. Her tone... it was so... emotionless. There are tears in her eyes. They don't fall. But I see them. Gods, she must hurt. I make the decision to take my chance here and now. I motion for her to come closer and reluctantly she obeys. I take her borg-enhanced hand and stare at the dull metal, suddenly feeling the urge to touch it. Softly stroking the back of this strong hand, I take my chance.</p>
<p>"Oh Seven, I'm so sorry. Can you ever forgive me? I made this so hard or you, for us. But you are so strong and so patient and... Seven you know so much about me, you found me, finally, and my true heart - against all odds. Honour demands that I offer you an appropriate finder's reward and I can only think of one..."</p>
<p>She tenses but I keep my hold on her. She looks at me in wonder. I turn her hand and place a kiss on her palm before I place it on my chest.</p>
<p>"Please Seven, I want you to have them both. One for my life and one for my love..."</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>I wait.</p>
<p>Nothing yet.</p>
<p>After three seconds she pulls her hand away.</p>
<p>I'm dying.</p>
<p>She takes me with her.</p>
<p>I'm dead. I'm sure. Any minute I will feel the hole she ripped into my chest.</p>
<p>The last thing I'll see is sickbay. Great. Of all places to die at.</p>
<p>I need to see her and turn my head at her.</p>
<p>With bother hand she wipes the tears from her face.</p>
<p>I never knew she could cry like that. Great, Klingon. You made her miserable again. Already back to business as usual, eh?<br>But then, from under the silent sobs she speaks up, barely audible,</p>
<p>"B'Elanna, I assure you, I..."</p>
<p>We had that line already, remember?<br>So she simply continues where I interrupted her... all the gut spilling for nothing? I need my earth-hole. Quick.</p>
<p>"... I will keep them safe, I'll have both my eyes on them, never again shall they be lost. Never again shall /you/ be lost, B- BangwI. Not ever again will I lose you."</p>
<p>I can't help it. I want to reassure her with a gentle smile, but all I'm capable of is a toothy grin. I pull her down to first hug her and then give her a soul-searing kiss.</p>
<p>My mind goes blank.<br>This moment is for hearts only.</p>
<p>When she breaks off for air my fuzzy brain allows me to voice the first thought I have.</p>
<p>"Pretty sure of yourself, eh?"</p>
<p>The heat from my blush wanders southward when she gives me a knowing smile.</p>
