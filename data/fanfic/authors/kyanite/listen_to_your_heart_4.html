<!-- Listen to Your Heart \ Chapter IV -->

<p>For the second time in my life I see myself confronted with the futility of resistance.</p>
<p>For the first time in my life I believe.<br>I believe her, when she tells me that she loves me.<br>I believe, that I return her feelings.</p>
<p>I want to believe in our friendship, in our love.</p>
<p>But it is also for the second time in my life that I am scared to death.<br>I fear for my life, for my - family.<br>Those who love me.</p>
<p>Those I love.</p>

<p>B'Elanna has lost her memory. But still her klingon nature allows her to experience strong emotions. I stated that it is time for her to find out about her former self in order to get to know the individual that she was. She is very pleased with what she learned about klingon culture, although the cuisine did not meet her approval. She recently started to run Lieutenant Torres' exercise programs on the holodeck. It appears that her body remembers the Bat'leth and from the beginning her movements were very smooth and ... skilled.</p>
<p>I was also able to convince her to study the personal logs of her former self. For some reason it did not surprise me that this lecture disturbed her.It is obvious that she does not like the person she was. The doctor believes that her constant resistance and ... plain ... refusal to remember reinforces the block on her memories.</p>
<p>However, I tend to disagree.</p>
<p>B'Elanna does start to remember.</p>
<p>I can see it in her eyes. And I hear it when she speaks. Her speech pattern and her vocabulary slowly transform to those of Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres. A clear evidence are the klingon terms, mostly swear words and curses. She utilizes them unconsciously like Lieutenant Torres used to. They are not directed at me but the increasing frequency of their use worries me.</p>
<p>I believe I am afraid.</p>
<p>I am afraid, that Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres, Chief Engineer of the starship Voyager, eventually returns.</p>
<p>I don't want to lose B'Elanna. She seems to be content and at peace with who she is now. And Miral is happy, too. I don't want to lose my family.</p>
<p>But Voyager's crew is my collective.</p>
<p>And this collective needs its chief engineer.</p>
<p>A volatile, short tempered, mysterious, agitated, brilliant half klingon chief engineer.</p>
<p>And I wonder, how selfish I really am.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>She calls me BangwI' - Beloved.<br>I feel a sharp pain in my chest, although I know that I am physically unharmed. Her tears soak through the fabric of my biosuit. She pleads with me. I want to tell her how I feel. I want to tell her how much I love her. How much I love Miral. And how much I wish for us to be a real family.</p>
<p>"B'Elanna, believe me, I want to. But I am afraid..." Then I loosen my hold on her.</p>
