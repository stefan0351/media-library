<!-- Listen to Your Heart \ Chapter III -->

<p>I'm overflowing with emotions.<br>I believe I would burst wouldn't it be for the Vulcan's, T'Vok ?, sessions. The first thing I noticed about him were his funny ears. But considering my impressive forehead I should be careful in choosing the object of my jokes. He helps me to reflect on the the events of each day. I appreciate it. And I think I like him. I feel he understands me, though he doesn't show any emotions himself.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Each day she takes me by the hand and leads me through my day. And I sense my love for her growing with every single one of these days. She is very supportive and understanding and patient. She is so very different from the rest, especially those who call themselves my friends.They are searching for the Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres they knew. The one they remember. The one I don't remember. Their eagerness to trigger my memory is tiring. And I can't stand the compassion or even pity in their eyes.</p>
<p>Seven takes me every day to the mess hall to give me the opportunity to engage in conversation and small talk, to socialize with the crew. But she never urges me, never presses me. I'm thankful for that. I made it a habit to enter behind her, partly hiding my smaller frame behind her back. She never says anything, but I think she noticed. When we sit with others she answers questions and sometimes converses with some of her acquaintances. Although her focus seems to be elsewhere I can feel her eyes on me. She watches me, carefully, subtly. She watches over me. She protects me.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>I feel a natural pride in me. It's strong and powerful, as every emotion I experience. My body may be small, but it's very strong, muscular - athletic.<br>I enjoy every movement.</p>
<p>Seven carefully introduced me to the idea of catching up with my past. She suggested to start with background information of who I am. She imbedded it in lessons about klingon and human culture and history for the children. I liked her way to teach the children about uniqueness, identity, individuality and respect. In fact, I was amazed.</p>
<p>I started my own research about Klingons and Humans. I am a warrior. Well, I should be. But at least I feel like a warrior. Most of the time. I understand the pride I feel and the need for honour and my...</p>
<p>Again I see her face. Her smiles are rare and I feel truly honoured when she bestowes one of them on me. I know I love her. But she thinks I'm not being true.</p>
<p>How could I ever blame her? I heard her story. I learn about our history. When I read my daily pile of personal log entries I feel the bile rise. What an idiot I've been. P'taq. How could I treat her so bad, so utterly without honour and respect? This angelic being. She knows of so much hurt and pain. I don't want her to lose her memory. But I pray that I get a chance to make her forget.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder how she finds the strength to carry on, day after day. To think I've added to her misery... I understand why she doesn't believe me. And I feel something else growing inside of me. An icy hand that rises and slowly reaches for my heart. It's fear.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>I stand in the doorway and watch them sleep. Seven is lying on Mirals bed, her long legs stretched out, her head resting on the head board. A book lies on her lap. From what I learned about my daughter it's an old book about King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. My daughter snuggled against Seven's side is a picture of utter peace. With a smile I remember how I thought Miral would be our daughter, she certainly has the looks. I wish she was. As I watch them the feeling of home returns. My heart swells with love for my two angels... Tears are gathering in my eyes when I feel the icy hand again, approaching my heart. A sniff that escapes me when I try to wipe the tears from my eyes awakes Seven. I didn't mean to wake her. I didn't want her to see me cry. I recognize the look in her eyes. I have seen it a lot in the past few weeks. It's a look of concern, clouded by a tinge of guilt.</p>
<p>I turn away from her to leave for my own bedroom. I didn't expect her to be so fast, though. She catches me in the middle of the living room. Her human hand settles on my shoulder, gently urging me to turn around. I do as requested, but still I refuse to look at her. With her human hand still holding me in place she lifts my chin with two of her metal adorned fingers. Ultimately I'm forced to meet her gaze. I feel her eyes tenderly probing and searching my soul.</p>
<p>"BangwI', I'm here. Please find me." I hear myself whispering.</p>
<p>All of a sudden she pulls me into a tight embrace, willingly I let my face be burried in her bosom. The grip tightens and I feel the ice again. And now I know that she feels it too. I try to hug her back but it seems that all my strength has vanished and all I'm capable of are body shaking sobs and a weak, muffled, pathetic plea:</p>
<p>"Seven, please... please believe me. Believe in me... in us..."</p>
