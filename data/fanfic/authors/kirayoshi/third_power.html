<p align=center>--The Who "Join Together"</p>

<p>"C'mon, ugly!" the battered young woman shouted through broken teeth, hiding her fear
behind a curtain of rage.  "Is that the best you can do?"</p>

<p>It hadn't been going well for the Slayer.  She was on the ropes and she knew it.  Two hours
ago, Buffy was partying at the Bronze with two of her best friends, Willow and Tara, now
she was fighting for her life against the arch demon Asmodeus.  And losing.</p>

<p>Asmodeus was an archetypal demon-lord; his mahogany skin covering a muscular frame, his
countenance fearsome to behold, his features angular and saturnine.  He towered over the
diminutive slayer, his legs stood two meters apart, his terrible cloven hooves scraped the
ground with every step, his massive arms spread out, preparing to crush Buffy's body like
squeezing an orange.</p>

<p>Buffy cursed herself for not heeding Giles' warnings earlier that week.  Spike had heard
rumblings from the demon community about some new arch demon planning to move in on
Sunnydale.  Now that Adam had been eliminated by Buffy and her friends just a couple of
months ago, there was a vacuum in the demonic power structure of Sunnydale, and
Asmodeus was just the demon to fill that hole.  But he had enough sense to recognize the
threat of the Slayer.</p>

<p>So he chose tonight to ambush her.</p>

<p>Tonight, when she was preoccupied with her friends Willow and Tara.  Tonight, when she
and Willow were celebrating the start of their sophomore year in college and Tara's return to
Sunnydale after visiting her parents for the summer.  Tonight, when the pain of losing Riley, of
hearing the hateful things he had said, finally dissipated under the love and friendship of these
two wiccan beauties.  Just two hours ago the two of them had burnt up the dance floor at the
Bronze, undulating and spinning in close orbit around each other, oblivious to anything and
anyone else.  Buffy couldn't remember a time when she felt so free, so happy.  Just to be with
Willow, her closest friend and secret love, even if she wouldn't tell Willow about her love,
that was enough.  And the fact that Tara made her happy.  Willow was with someone she
loved, and she still cared enough about Buffy to include her in her life.  And for the Slayer,
that was blessing enough for one lifetime.</p>

<p>Now, she had become a punching bag for a powerful demon.  Asmodeus knew that she
would oppose him, so he made the first move against her.  And now she was being thrown
around like a rag doll.  She had managed to push Willow and Tara out of the way, just
before the onslaught began, but she wasn't able to create an opening in the fight.  Just any
opening where she could hit back and retake the offensive.  The savage attack of this demon
had kept her on the defensive; he was tiring her out, and she knew it.  He had already
managed to connect a few blows, breaking her jaw and nearly swelling her left eye shut in a
livid shiner.  But she had no way to conserve her strength.  If she stood still for only a split
second, just one more direct blow from that demon would be enough to end her life.  And
she knew that she couldn't keep fighting at this pace for long.  She was tiring fast, and
Asmodeus knew it.</p>

<p>Willow and Tara stood stock still as Buffy fought for her life against the mahogany skinned
demon.  Willow refused to run and hide while her best friend was on the ropes.  She and
Tara just stood there, afraid for their friend, scared that she would be killed before their eyes.
Willow had the prescience to carry a dagger forged of cold iron, the one metal certain to kill
demons, but she didn't see the opening to use it.</p>

<p>"G-goddess, Willow," Tara stammered, her nervous stutter returning as her fear levels rose.
"What can w-we d-do to help her?"</p>

<p>"I'm thinking, Tara," Willow said calmly.  "There's one way, but it could be dangerous for us.
But it might be the only way."  She suddenly turned to Tara.  "Do you trust me?"</p>

<p>"With my heart and with my life, Willow," Tara vowed solemnly.</p>

<p>"Remember the enjoining spell I used to back Buffy against Adam?"</p>

<p>Tara's eyes opened wide with understanding.  "You think that will work again?"</p>

<p>"Probably better than before," Willow nodded.  "My spells have always been more powerful
when we worked them together.  But we gotta hurry!"  She cocked her head toward the
battle, as Buffy was slowing down, and Asmodeus's blows were getting closer to connecting.
"Buffy's down for the count!"</p>

<p>There was no hesitation on the blond witch's part.  "Let's do it," said Tara.</p>

<p>Willow took Tara's hands in her own, an said, "Concentrate on Buffy.  Send all your
thoughts, all your strength, all your love to her.  Relax, take calming breaths."  Tara began to
meditate, to clear her mind, to concentrate on the Slayer, her friend, her defender.  Willow
calmed herself, found the center of her being where her magic was strongest.  She connected
that center with Tara's, and felt her powers grow as they always did when she joined this way
with the one she loved.  She began the incantation;</p>

<p>"The power of the Slayer and all who yield it!"</p>

<p>Tara concentrated on the ancient words as Willow shouted them.</p>

<p>"Last to ancient first, we invoke thee!"</p>

<p>A vortex of arcane powers formed around Buffy and Asmodeus as they battled.  Neither
was aware of the vortex, but Buffy felt a strength growing inside of her.  She now stood on
trembling feet, feeling her arms grow more firm, more solid.</p>

<p>"Grant us thy domain and primal strength!"</p>

<p>Willow had to shout louder to be heard above the din of the storms.  She was handling large
amounts of power, forces she would never have dared attempt were it not for Tara's
assistance, support and love.</p>

<p>"Accept us in the power we possess!"</p>

<p>Buffy's strength continued to build.  Unaware of the spell her best friend was casting, she felt
at first as though she was getting her second wind.</p>

<p>"Make us mind and heart and spirit joined!"</p>

<p>Willow and Tara felt the strength building in them as well.  They felt more assured of their
powers, more confident in their abilities as wiccans.  Yes, they both thought, they could do
this.</p>

<p>"Let the hand encompass us!"</p>

<p>As she took the battle with Asmodeus on the offensive, Buffy started to recognize the
sensations coursing through her.  The gathering power, the greater strength than she had ever
possessed.  Just like when she took on Adam.  Willow had cast the enjoining spell.</p>

<p>"Do thy will!"</p>

<p>And now where she was sprawled on the ground, awaiting the killing blow, she now stood
up on confident feet, feeling her renewed strength, and the strength of all the slayers before
her.  And something more, the strength of two powerful wiccans who cast the spell to restore
her.</p>

<p>Asmodeus' eyes widened as he took in the sight; this woman who should have died under his
attack was now standing before him, her wounds healing before his eyes, her arms rising with
restored strength, her strong sinewy frame infused with great power.  Even her broken teeth
were made whole again.  Her eyes glowed red, boring down into him like angry suns.  And in
the cold black pit of his heart, Asmodeus knew fear.</p>

<p>"You had your chance, Ass-Backward-Us," Buffy hissed at her enemy.  "You had me on the
ropes.  But that don't matter now!"  Without any further warning, she unleashed a devastating
flying scissor kick to the demon's jaw.  He crumpled to the floor, black blood pooling from
his mouth.  "Because I just got me a whole new shipment of whup-ass, and I'm spending it all
on you!"</p>

<p>Buffy's attack was brutal and swift.  She was giving no quarter, and taking no prisoners.  She
delivered a massive flurry of kicks with both speed and deadly accuracy.  Before Asmodeus
could regroup himself to counter, she rammed his solar plexus with her shoulder, sending him
tumbling to the ground.</p>

<p>"Willow!" Buffy shouted, "The dagger!  Let's end this!"</p>

<p>"On it!" Willow fished the dagger out of her bookbag.  Buffy expected Willow to simply toss
the dagger to her so she could take out Asmodeus once and for all.  Willow, however had a
different approach.  She held the dagger's tip between her thumb and forefinger, took aim,
and threw it with deadly accuracy.  The dagger imbedded itself deeply into Asmodeus' chest,
into the demon's festering heart.  Asmodeus lurched angrily, clawing at the air, before his
body disintegrated into a shower of ash.</p>

<p>Buffy coughed slightly as the demon's ash got into her lungs.  "Geez, Wills, give a Slayer
some warning, will ya?"</p>

<p>"Sorry, Buff," Willow smiled innocently, but Buffy wasn't fooled for a second.  "I just had a
feeling that would work."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy crossed her arms over her chest and smirked at the red-haired witch.  "You
were just trying to impress your girlfriend."</p>

<p>"Hey," Tara defended Willow.  "I'm impressed."</p>

<p>"Well," Buffy admitted as she bent down and picked up the dagger from the pile of ash that
was once Asmodeus, "I'm impressed with the both of you.  Nice spellwork, girls."</p>

<p>"We aim to please," Tara announced.</p>

<p>"But what possessed you to try that enjoining spell?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Desperation, Buff," Willow answered.  "Pure desperation."</p>

<p>"Well, Wills," Buffy smiled, "you should get desperate more--UNGH!"  Suddenly Buffy
collapsed to the ground.  Willow and Tara immediately rushed to her side, each one taking
her by one shoulder.  "Buffy?" Willow pleaded. "You okay?"</p>

<p>"Oh, fine," Buffy answered, a glazed look in her eyes.  "But there are two of you, Willow."
Her speech was slurring, and she looked confused.  "Hey, that's perfect.  Tara can have one
of you, and I can have the other."</p>

<p>Willow dismissed Buffy's words as the ramblings of a woman disoriented by a powerful spell.
"That's nice, Buffy.  Now how about we get you back to the dorm?"</p>

<p>"No, really," Buffy sounded more drunk than anything else.  Willow and Tara started to
worry about the power that they had channeled into their friend.  "We-we could get together,
we could--" Buffy looked closely at Willow's face and gasped.  "Oh, my God," she
exclaimed.  "You have the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen!"  She turned to an increasingly
embarrassed Tara, asking, "Doesn't she have the most beautiful eyes you've ever seen?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Buffy," Tara said, trying to hoist the incoherent Slayer back to her dorm.  "Th-they
were the first thing I n-noticed."</p>

<p>Buffy then regarded Tara with a gimlet eye.  "But your eyes are beautiful too.  A sort of
charcoal grey-blue." She glanced at Willow, then at Tara.  "You both have beautiful eyes.  I
can't decide.  I love them both."  She wrapped her arms around her rescuers tightly, shouting,
"I love you both!  I, Buffy--Buffy--hey, Wills, what was my last name again?"</p>

<p>"Summers," a mortally humiliated Willow sighed.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Willy."  She cleared her throat dramatically, then continued; "I, Buffy Summers,
hereby declare that I love these two women, Willy and Taters!"  She giggled suddenly,
saying, "Sorry, Tara, I called you Taters.  I'm going to go nite-nite now."  With that, her head
dropped down, and she started to snore loudly.  The two exasperated Wiccans then quietly
took the sleeping Slayer back to Stevensen Hall.</p>

<p>They opened the door to Buffy and Willow's dorm, and brought the Slayer inside, hoisting
her as carefully as possible past the furniture.  "Let's get her to her bed," said Willow.</p>

<p>"Personally," Tara grunted under the weight of the unconscious Buffy, "I don't think she'd
notice if we left her in the fire escape."</p>

<p>"Tempting as that idea might be," Willow lamented, "I think we'd better bring her to the bed."
They managed to steer her body to the bed, and unceremoniously dropped her onto the
mattress.  They watched as the Slayer dozed soundly, unaware of her surroundings, or even
her identity.  "Well," Tara announced, "that was an eventful evening.  You gonna call it a
night?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Willow answered.  "I'd walk you back to your dorm, but I don't wanna leave Buffy
alone.  She crashed pretty hard from that enjoining spell."</p>

<p>"No problem," Tara answered.  "I can stay with you.  That is, if you want."</p>

<p>Willow regarded her beloved with a slight smile.  "Sure, but I'm not up to anything hot and
sweaty tonight."  The fact was, despite some innuendo to the contrary from Xander, the two
young lovers had yet to go "all the way" in their physical relationship.  They kissed, they
groped, they occasionally caressed each other topless, but that's as far as they've gone.</p>

<p>"No rush, Willow," Tara said.  "I just thought you'd like the company.  Besides, if I went
back to my dorm, I'd just lay awake worrying about Buffy."  Tara slipped off her shoes, and
sat on Willow's bed.</p>

<p>Willow sat next to Tara, and instinctively wrapped her arm around the blond witch's
shoulder.  "Thanks for helping back there, Tara," she whispered into her ear.</p>

<p>"No problem," Tara smiled as she felt Willow's lips on her ear.  She lay herself down on the
bed, and Willow lay behind her, spooning her body against Tara's.  "I love you, Willow," she
added with a yawn, as she slowly leaned into Willow's embrace, and drifted to sleep.</p>

<p>"Love you too, Taters," Willow giggled drowsily.  The two witches nodded off smiling.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Two days earlier;</p>

<p>"So, Buffy," the handsome blond had asked her.  "You going to be at the Bronze tomorrow
night?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, Riley," Buffy sighed as she chatted with Riley at the Espresso Pump over mochas.
"Tara's coming back, so Willow and I are going to party with her."</p>

<p>"Tara," Riley repeated dully.  He sipped his mocha, and said, "I just thought that you'd want
to spend some time with me, now that you're back in the dorms.  I'm assuming you're living
alone this year."</p>

<p>"No," Buffy answered.  "Willow's rooming with me again."</p>

<p>"Oh?  I thought that she'd be rooming with Tara."  Buffy detected the faintest twinge of vitriol
as he said the name of Willow's girlfriend.</p>

<p>"She does hang with her a lot," Buffy said casually, "but seeing as how they're dating, that's to
be expected."</p>

<p>"And this doesn't bother you."</p>

<p>Buffy didn't mistake the scorn in his voice that time, and her own outrage started to rise.
"Why should the fact that my best friend is happier than she's been for a long time bother
me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I dunno," Riley countered, suddenly feeling defensive against his girlfriend.  "Just that
she's getting her rocks off with another girl."</p>

<p>"You have a problem with Willow loving another woman?" Buffy's anger threatened to
overtake her voice, but she was determined to keep her calm.  Reason would win out over
emotion.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no.  You wanna hang out with a dyke, that's your business."</p>

<p>Buffy regarded Riley with the same stare she usually employed against vampires she was
preparing to stake.  "Excuse me, but did you just call my best friend a dyke?"</p>

<p>"Hey, now, look, Buffy," a suddenly scared Riley tried to explain himself.  "I didn't mean it
like that, I was just--"</p>

<p>Buffy grabbed Riley by the collar of his shirt, saying, "I just asked you a simple yes-or-no
question, Riley; Did. You. Just. Call. My. Best. Friend. A. DYKE?"</p>

<p>Riley gulped hard, knowing that there was no escape, and probably no forgiveness for him.
And the cold fury in Buffy's eyes chilled him to the core.  "Uh, well," he said timidly, "yes.  I
didn't mean--"</p>

<p>Riley's sentence was interrupted by Buffy's fist landing on his chin, hard enough to draw
blood.  Riley toppled back in his chair, landing gracelessly on the floor.  "Riley Finn, I'm only
going to say this once, so you'd better make sure you understand; I never want to see your
miserable face again as long as I live.  Don't you ever look me up, don't call me, don't run
into me on campus, don't ever contact me in any way, form or fashion.  If you happen to
notice me on campus, make damn sure I don't see you.  I want to go through the rest of my
life without being reminded of the gutter trash who dared to insult my best friend.  No," she
added when Riley tried to speak, "I don't want to hear it!  Accept that I will never forgive
you for what you said about Willow.  Don't say a word, just nod once if you understand."</p>

<p>Riley nodded, and Buffy got up from her seat, and looked at the man she once claimed to
love.  "It's funny, Riley.  I can't even work up enough energy to hate you.  You're just not
worth it.  I just don't care enough."  She took Riley's mocha, and tipped its contents onto his
sprawled body.  "Goodbye, Finn," she spat out, before walking out of the Espresso Pump
and out of Riley Finn's life.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy woke up slowly, as the sunlight crept slowly up the length of her body.  She squinted as
the light hit her eyes, as her head throbbed with the mother of all hangovers.  Funny, she
thought to herself.  I don't remember getting drunk.  She chased that line of thought, asking
herself what she did remember.</p>

<p>When her memories came to her, she felt a strong desire to bury her head in a pillow, and
pray that Willow wasn't in the bed next to hers.  She turned hesitantly to the bed, and noticed
a body sitting there.  But it wasn't Willow.  The dirty-blond hair, the slightly different shape of
her curves, they weren't Willow.  They were...</p>

<p>"Tara?"  Buffy asked.  Tara smiled at the sound of Buffy's voice, saying, "Good morning,
Sleeping Beauty.  Good thing it's Sunday, or you'd have missed your first day of classes."</p>

<p>"Wha-what happened?  Where's Willow?"</p>

<p>"To answer in reverse order," Tara said, "Willow's on a bagel run.  She said you liked the
Everything bagels, and she'll surprise us with the others.  As for what happened, you crashed
after you beat Asmodeus.  We used the rejoining spell to empower you, and once the
adrenaline conked out, you were disoriented and euphoric."</p>

<p>"Oh, God, I remember.  I remember saying I loved the two of you." Buffy then dropped her
head in her hands, mortified of her behavior and afraid that she jeopardized her friendships
with Willow and Tara.</p>

<p>"Don't worry," Willow said as she entered the dorm with a large brown paper bag.  "You
were just out of it, we won't hold you responsible for anything.  Besides," she grinned
mischievously, "you're apparently in love with Willy and Taters.  Whoever they are."  Buffy
smiled as Willow placed the bag on the nearest level surface.  "I got three Everything bagels,
three pesto, and three of those cranberry nut jobs that you like, Tara.  All sliced and freshly
toasted.  I also got cream cheese," she withdrew three small tubs and a plastic knife.
"Garden vegetable, smoked salmon, and apple cinnamon.  I'd recommend that last one for
the cranberry."</p>

<p>"You are a giver goddess, Willow," Buffy got out of the bed, noticing for the first time that
she was wearing the same clothes she wore last night.  "Did you guys sleep in the same bed
last night?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Willow said.  "We didn't want to leave you alone after you zoned out, so we brought
you here, took off your shoes and let you sleep it off.  We took the other bed and fell asleep
in our street clothes."</p>

<p>"Hey, thanks for getting me here, guys," Buffy said, as she located her purse, which Willow
hung from the doorknob.  "How much do I owe you for the bagels?"</p>

<p>"This one's on us," Tara insisted. "You saved the world, the least we can do is spring for
breakfast."</p>

<p>"Thanks," Buffy said, as she spread some salmon cream cheese over her first bagel and
munched down.  "So, how did you guys sleep?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not too bad," Tara mused.  "B-but I did have this weird dream."</p>

<p>"Hazard of working the Hellmouth," Buffy observed.  "Weird dreams are part of the territory.
What was it about?"</p>

<p>"Well," Tara recalled, "I was you, I think.  I was having a mocha with Riley, and he started
talking about me and Willow.  He called Willow a dyke, then you--that is, I--decked him,
and told him I--I mean, you, never wanted to see him again--"</p>

<p>"Then I poured a mocha on him." Buffy finished.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Tara said, perplexed.  "How did you--"</p>

<p>"That's exactly why Riley and I split up for good two days ago," Buffy said, her nerves flaring.
Something wasn't right here.  "But I never told you guys about it.  You described it perfectly."</p>

<p>"Wait, wait," Willow backtracked.  "You mean Riley called me a dyke?"</p>

<p>"His exact words," Buffy said ruefully.</p>

<p>Willow's eyes lit up like a Menorah on the last night of Chanukah.  "And you dumped him
because of what he called me?  Wow, I've never had my honor defended like that before!"</p>

<p>"Hey," Buffy countered. "He can pick on me, but nobody picks on my friends.  Anyway, he's
out of my life, and I don't even miss him."</p>

<p>"Don't worry," Tara consoled Buffy.  "He wasn't worth it, if my dream was any indication."</p>

<p>"You're damn right," Buffy agreed.  "But I'm worried about your dream.  Y'see," she
hesitated, then continued.  "I had a dream last night too."</p>

<p>"What about?" Willow knew the cold caste that formed on Buffy's face.  Something was
happening.</p>

<p>"I was in a crypt," Buffy began.  "I saw Oz, he was naked, and there was someone else
there.  I didn't quite recognize her--"</p>

<p>"Veruca," Willow whispered.  "You dreamed about Oz and Veruca?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, sorry," Buffy admitted.  "And the weird part, I was you, Wills.  I knew I was you, and
I knew that Oz had slept with Veruca.  Hey, I'm sorry if I'm dredging up something you
wanted to forget--"</p>

<p>"No, it's all right," Willow said, "he's in the past.  And I had a bizarre dream too."  As Buffy
and Tara turned to her, she continued; "I was walking through this school hallway," she
started, as more of the dream became clear to her memory.  "Someone named Simone had
been expelled, that much I knew when the dream started,--"</p>

<p>"Simone DaCosta?" Tara asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah, that was her." Willow looked at her.  "You knew her?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Tara said bitterly.  "She's the first girl I ever kissed.  Senior year in high school.  The
principal caught us behind the bleachers, and expelled her.  My folks were able to keep me in
school, but word got out--"</p>

<p>"And everyone steered clear of you," Willow finished.  "That was in my dream.  Two
quarterback punks started to lob rocks at me--"</p>

<p>"Bobby Jacks and Hector Garcia," Tara supplied the names.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear Goddess," Willow breathed, "I didn't know you went through that.  No wonder
you took so long to open up to me."  She rushed over to the bed where Tara was sitting, and
draped her arms around her love's shoulders.  "I'm so sorry, Tara."</p>

<p>"It's okay, Willow," Tara soothed her beloved.  "I have you, now, and Buffy.  I'm all right."</p>

<p>"But this is too weird," Willow stated after disengaging the hug.  "I dreamed I was you, Tara.
You dreamed you were Buffy, and you, Buffy, you dreamed you were me.  What's
happening?"</p>

<p>Buffy looked at her two friends long and intently.  She could practically feel their fear, their
confusion as well as her own.  She rolled it around in her mind, until she had an idea.</p>

<p>She opened her foot locker, and pulled out a throwing knife.  "Willow," she handed the knife
to Willow.  "Last night, you demonstrated Slayer's skill with that dagger.  Can you hit the
dartboard from thirty paces?"</p>

<p>"I'll try," said Willow, as she marked off thirty paces from the dartboard Buffy had hung on
the front door.  She looked at the target, took aim, and threw the dagger.</p>

<p>The tip imbedded itself dead center.</p>

<p>Buffy examined the dagger in the dartboard, her suspicions confirmed.  She stood before
Willow and Tara, and made an announcement that stunned the two wiccans, especially when
they realized that it was the only explanation;</p>

<p>"Ladies, we're still enjoined."</p>

<p align=center>--Michael Nesmith(The Monkees) "Daily Nightly"</p>

<p>Three lone figures met together at midnight in Shepherd's Meadow.  The undeveloped lot, a
strong nexus for benevolent magical forces, had often been used for wiccan celebrations, and
other sacred rites.  The three women who came to the meadow were in search for answers.
Something had happened to them two weeks ago, something that bound them mentally and
emotionally.</p>

<p>Ever since their battle with Asmodeus, when Willow and Tara used something called an
enjoining spell to lend their strength to Buffy, the three women were bonded.  When Willow
had used the spell before, its effects were temporary.  But backed by two witches instead of
one, the spell seemed more permanent.  Two weeks later, and the spell's effects were still
being felt.</p>

<p>Three days after the spell was cast, Buffy found herself thinking constantly of Willow and
Tara.  It was as though she physically needed to see them, or hear from them.  When they
met later for lunch, the two young witches admitted that they felt the same for Buffy.  When
they were within sight of each other, the need was aleviated for a while.  Over time, this need
faded, but there was still the sense of pleasure when they were together.  Buffy didn't entirely
understand this; Willow and Tara were romantically involved, and Buffy had been secretly
attracted to Willow, but this new sense of being more at peace when they were together was
unsettling.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Buffy started to notice changes in her abilities.  As the Slayer, she possessed
greater strength, stamina and reflexes.  Now, she seemed to have a greater affinity to magic,
something she had never demonstrated before.  Three nights ago, she fought against a small
horde of newbie vampires, and found that by concentrating, she could immobilize them with a
thought.  This made slaying them easier, but it still disturbed her.</p>

<p>But the empathic bond, that was the final straw.  Faith had once asked Buffy, "You ever
notice how slaying makes you hungry and horny?"  Buffy never liked to admit this to others,
but she felt that as well.  Under normal circumstances, she could control her passions, but this
night was different.</p>

<p>After the rush of dispatching the vampires last night, she felt that familiar arousal.  She thought
that she could walk it off on her way back to the dorm.  But once she was back on her bed,
getting ready for sleep, the arousal grew more insistant.  The sensitivity in her breasts became
unbearable, the heat between her thighs demanded her attention.  She started to carress
herself, slowly at first, then with increasing pressure and passion until she finally climaxed.
Fortunately Willow was at Tara's that evening, so she wasn't disturbing anyone.  She
chuckled ruefully at the realization that she derived more satisfaction from her own hands than
from any of her experiences with her ex-boyfriend Riley.</p>

<p>The next day, she ran into Willow and Tara, both smiling conspiratorial smiles.  "Okay girls,"
Buffy raised an eyebrow in their direction.  "What's the what?"</p>

<p>"Well," Tara breathed happily, "we finally did it."</p>

<p>"It?"</p>

<p>"It," Willow added.  "The big 'It'."</p>

<p>"Oh," Buffy said, comprehending.  "That 'it'.  So, how was 'it'?"</p>

<p>"I think we're still in afterglow," Willow said dreamily.  "I don't know what happened last
night.  We were watching 'The Princess Bride', when suddenly, I felt very warm."</p>

<p>"Then I felt it too," Tara laughed, "then one thing led to another, then--"</p>

<p>"I get it," Buffy answered, "spare me the details.  But wait a minute," she said suddenly,
thinking back to last night.  "When did this start."</p>

<p>Willow tried to remember; "Lessee, it was about when Buttercup was about to be attacked
by the Shrieking Eels, so, about ten-ish?"</p>

<p>"That's when I finished my patrol," Buffy said, half to herself.  She slumped in her chair, a
worried look on her face.  "Hooboy."</p>

<p>Tara looked at Buffy's concerned expression, and asked, "What is it?"</p>

<p>"Guys, this bond is getting stronger.  Sometimes, after patrol, especially after I get a heavy
workout, I get, well--"</p>

<p>"Hungry and horny?" Willow grinned.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy said, blushing slightly.  "Well, that happened to me last night.  Usually it goes
away once I get back to the dorm, but last night it just got stronger, until I had to do
something."</p>

<p>"You mean you--" Tara couldn't finish the sentence.  Buffy said nothing, she only nodded.
"And you think your arousal spread to us?"</p>

<p>"And once you two got into it, it hit me back even stronger," Buffy finished.  "The other day,
Willow, you noticed that  you could feel my frustration?  I think that we're now picking up
each other's emotions."</p>

<p>"Empathy," Tara stated.  "Wow."</p>

<p>"Yeah, and I want to know why," Buffy decided.  "Too bad Giles is visiting some friends in
London.  He'd have some ideas."</p>

<p>"Maybe we can find a higher source," Willow suggested.  "The full moon is in two days, I
think we should perform a petitioning ritual."</p>

<p>"A petitioning ritual?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"We have the ritual in one of your books, right, Tara?"  Willow turned to her lover, who
nodded.  "Yeah, I know which one.  The Plea to the Fates."</p>

<p>"You saying that these Fates will have the answer?"</p>

<p>"Not in and of themselves," Willow consoled Buffy, "but they can help us to find it ourselves.
Buffy, we're walking uncharted ground with this enjoining.  We need to know what is
happening to us."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy admitted.  "I don't think that you two want me to know when you're making
love every time.  About which, by the way, I am extremely sorry.  I feel like a voyeur."</p>

<p>"I feel like a voyeur too," Willow chirped.  "Know where we can get one?"  Tara, who was
sipping a mocha at the time, suddenly found herself laughing so hard that her mocha was
coming out of her nose.  Willow leaned her head toward Buffy's ear and stage-whispered, "I
just love to do that to her."</p>

<p>"You are one wicked witch, Wills," Buffy announced.  "Okay, I have class in fifteen minutes.
How about we meet in my dorm at three, and you can brief me on this spell then."</p>

<p>"Okay," Willow and Tara chorused in unison.  The three women left for their seperate
classes, hoping that once they met later, they could start finding answers.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>The night of the full moon, they were ready.</p>

<p>They met at Shepherd's Meadow, to begin the Plea to the Fates.  "Welcome, and merry
meet," Tara greeted Willow and Buffy.  She kissed Willow on both cheeks, then kissed Buffy
the same.  Buffy, knowing it was expected of her, turned to Willow and kissed her cheeks as
well.  The three women then linked their hands, standing in a close ring.</p>

<p>"Whenever you are in need of anything," Tara chanted, and Willow joined in, "once in each
month, and better to do it when the moon is full, then shall you assemble in some secret
place.  To these shall I teach things that are yet unknown, and you shall be free from all
slavery.  So mote it be."  </p>

<p>Buffy nodded when they were finished with their chant. "Okay, Tara.  It's your show."</p>

<p>"First, let's make sure we have our supplies.  Did you each bring some salt?"</p>

<p>"Right here," Willow said as she and Buffy held up salt shakers.  Tara smiled, producing a
small pill bottle full of rock salt.  She nodded as she looked at the others' contributions; they
would be satisfactory for their purpose.</p>

<p>"Water?"</p>

<p>Willow held up an old wineskin, while Buffy and Tara brought out bottles of Evian.</p>

<p>"Candles?"</p>

<p>The three women brought out small votive candles, and Willow added, "I also brought some
matches to light them."  She showed a matchbox to the others.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Willow," Tara smiled at the red-head.  She then produced a compass from her
duffle bag, and placed it gently on the ground before them.  She looked at the needle as it
settled in one spot.  She pointed in the direction of the needle, saying, "That's north."  She
paced ten steps from the compass, and took her salt in her hand.  She emptied the salt onto
the ground, and Willow and Buffy followed suit, pouring salt onto the ground in front of them.
"Guardians of the Watchtower of the North," Tara chanted, "We bring salt, from the Earth.
We ask that you bless us in this endeavor."</p>

<p>They returned to the compass and took ten steps due east.  As per the incantation's
instructions, the three women took a deep breath, and exhaled at the ground in front of them.
"Guardians of the Watchtower of the East, we bring our breath, our Air.  We ask that you
bless us in this endeavor."</p>

<p>At the south point of the circle, they each placed their candle on the ground, and lit each
wick.  "Guardians of the Watchtower of the South, we bring candles, carriers of Fire.  We
ask that you bless us in this endeavor."</p>

<p>Finally, at the eastern point, they each poured water on the ground.  "Guardians of the
Watchtower of the West, we bring Water.  We ask that you bless us in this endeavor."</p>

<p>Buffy performed the ritual as directed earlier by Willow and Tara.  It was a simple ritual; each
of the compass points were governed by a specific Guardian, and each responded to one of
the four ancient elements.  North to Earth, South to Fire, East to Air, West to Water.  By
presenting each guardian with its representative offering, they believed that the Guardians
would grant their petition.</p>

<p>They then returned to the center of this enchanted circle they had created.  Tara, fighting the
tremors that accompanied such an arduous spell, spoke in a clear voice; </p>

<p>"Guardians, accept our offerings, and grant us our boon.<br>
We seek to know why our fates are entwined.<br>
We seek an audience with the Fates,<br>
With Clothos, the spinner of lives,<br>
With Lachesis, who weaves our lives into the tapestry of existence,<br>
With Atropos, who cuts the thread at the end of life.<br>
We ask their counsil and guidance.<br>
So mote it be!"</p>

<p>The three women stood, hands linked, as Tara finished the incantation.  Suddenly, all light
fled from their sight, and they were plunged into utter darkness.  Their eyes strained to grow
accustomed to the dark, when a bright, concentrated beam like a searchlight, stabbed
through the darkness at them.  They squinted involuntarily, but soon their eyes adapted.</p>

<p>"Who asks to see their fates?" A spectral voice intoned.</p>

<p>"W-we do," Tara answered.  Tara, Willow and Buffy looked around to see the speaker, but
no other figure was visible to them.  "We need to know how we are bound together?"</p>

<p>"Do you wish to see the threads of your lives?"  A pair of enormous hands appeared before
them.  Long, spindly fingers moved spiderlike, describing intricate patterns.  As they moved,
Buffy noticed that something was draped across their fingers.  A string looped gracefully
between the hands, like an impossible complex Cat's Cradle.  The hands worked the loop
across back and forth, creating ever more esoteric designs.  At one point, Buffy thought that
the loops formed an image like three stick figures holding hands.  A sign of the three of them,
Buffy thought.  Or else the Fates were really big on 'The Blair Witch Project'.  </p>

<p>"Behold, champions of the Light," the voice boomed.  Buffy noticed by now that it was not
one voice, but three speaking in unison.  As the voices spoke, the hands moved directly over
them, and the string draped around them.  "Look upon the threads of your lives.  Know why
you are bound."  Buffy touched the string, and looked closely at it.</p>

<p>It was not a single string, but three, braided tightly together.  One red string(she guessed that
this meant Willow), plaited with two yellow strings(Tara and herself).  Buffy held the string
with both hands---</p>

<p>And was suddenly sitting in a rec room on the campus of U.C. Sunnydale.  Willow was
sitting next to her, a look of stark fear in her features.  Buffy opened her mouth to speak but
no sound came out.  Suddenly, a hideous presence stalked them from outside.  Buffy realized
without seeing them who they were; the Gentlemen, those bizarre silent monsters who stole
the voices of Sunnydale.  She instinctively touched Willow's hand, and somehow, sensed
what she had to do.  Together, they concentrated, and a vending machine was thrown in front
of the door, blocking the Gentlemen from getting in.</p>

<p>Buffy realized that she was living Tara's memories.  She witnessed moments from Tara's
childhood, how her mother first told her of her heritage as a Wiccan, how she feared her
parents' ire when she realized that she was attracted to women, when she first met and lost
her heart to Willow.  When she saw the look in Willow's eyes whenever she spoke about
Buffy.</p>

<p>How that look would fill Tara with sadness, even though she was confidant of Willow's love.</p>

<p>And how Tara found herself looking longingly at Buffy.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes, and found herself back in the circle, watching the other two looking
back at her.  She gulped hard, as their expressions betrayed shock and dismay.  "Guys?"
Buffy asked, "did any of you just see the Gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"No," Tara said, "but I can guess what you saw.  You saw the Gentlemen from our point of
view?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy said.  "Well, yours anyway, Tara."</p>

<p>Tara nodded.  "I saw through Willow's eyes," she admitted.  "From Halloween, last year.
When you faced the Fear God, and the two of you fought?  I could feel your anger, Willow.
Your sorrow, your fear of losing Buffy's friendship and love."</p>

<p>"Yes," Willow added.  "I saw from her eyes as well.  When I first told you, Buffy, about
Tara."  She shivered as she spoke, realization slowly dawning on her face.  "When you and
Xander confronted me, when I accused you guys of not being able to accept Tara as my
girlfriend.  I thought that it was just because I was with a girl, but now..."  She glanced at
Tara, who nodded.</p>

<p>Willow then took Buffy's hands in her own, and asked, "How long have you been in love with
me?"</p>

<p>Buffy gulped.  She wanted to lie, to hide, but she couldn't hide, not with these two.  "Can't
you tell," she snapped at them.  "I mean, we're swapping memories, I thought you could read
my mind as well!"</p>

<p>"No, Buffy," Willow answered calmly.  "Just your emotions.  But I still need to know, Buffy.
How long have you loved me?"</p>

<p>"From the first day I met you, Willow," Buffy answered.  "And that doesn't mean loving you
as in being a friend.  That means being hopelessly in love with you, wanting to touch you, to
make love to you, to simply be around you, the whole chimichunga.  But you have Tara now,
I'm not going to get involved with that, I can't take you away from her, I love her too much--"</p>

<p>Tara looked at Buffy, silently, knowingly.  "I know."  Willow nodded as Tara spoke.</p>

<p>Buffy just looked at the two of them incredulously.  She prayed that Tara misunderstood her,
but feared that she didn't.  She jerked her hands away from Willow's and said, "Look,
Willow, Tara, this isn't going to work.  I'm sorry, but I don't know what the hell I'm thinking
or feeling, I'm in love with two women who are in love with each other, I have no idea how
that happened, I'm sorry, but I screwed this up big-time!" Turning to walk away, she said, "I
need to get away for a few hours.  To figure stuff out.  I don't know when I'll be back,
Willow, don't bother waiting up."  She ran off, away from the witches.</p>

<p>Willow considered reaching out to stop Buffy from running, but Tara stopped her.  "Let her
burn off her anguish, Willow," Tara consoled her beloved.  "You can feel her pain from here,
her torment.  She thinks somehow that she betrayed us, when we know better."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but how can we help her see that?" Willow lamented.  "I love her so much, Tara.  I
love you both.  Is that wrong?"</p>

<p>"No, Willow," Tara smiled.  "If we are bound together for the long haul, as the vision
indicated, it isn't wrong at all.  Besides, she can feel our emotions as well.  Let her feel our
calm, our concern, our love for her.  She'll calm down, then we can speak to her."</p>

<p>"Our love," Willow pondered.  She should have been shocked to hear this from Tara, but
somehow, once she thought about it, it just seemed right.  "C'mon, Tara," Willow took her
hand and moved foward, in the direction Buffy went, "we'll be there when she cools down."</p>

<p>The two wiccans knew that their lives from this moment were never going to be the same.
And that didn't scare them.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"Damn, damn, DAMN!" Buffy cursed herself as she stormed toward Whetherly Park.  She
hoped that there'd be some vampires in the vicinity, she needed to work off her anger, and
some undead punching bags would be ideal for the purpose.  </p>

<p>She knew that she had done possibly irreparable damage to her friendship with Willow.
How could she love her, especially after that performance she just gave?  She had Tara, they
were good together, how did Buffy have the right to interfere?</p>

<p>And how could she feel as attracted to Tara at the same time?</p>

<p>"Great, Buffy," she swore to herself.  "Fall in love with two women you can't have, because
they're involved with each other."  She allowed her self-recrimination to fester inside of her
soul, until she wanted to lash out at anything that moved.  Realizing that she was a potential
walking time-bomb, she tried to calm herself.  She tried to ignore her self-hatred.  She tried
to center herself, to calm herself down.</p>

<p>"Hey, Buffy," an all-too familiar voice greeted her.  She spun around, to see Riley Finn step
out from behind a tree.</p>

<p>"I thought I told you I never wanted to see you again," Buffy growled, adopting a defensive
stance.  Something felt wrong about Riley.  Something nasty--</p>

<p>"Hey, Buffy," the ex-soldier smiled at her.  "I think that we have something worth salvaging.  I
want us to work."</p>

<p>"We don't work, asswipe," Buffy glowered at her former boyfriend.  "There is nothing about
you that I would salvage.  I want you out of my life, Riley.  Go!"</p>

<p>Riley suddenly grabbed Buffy by the arm, forcing Buffy to fight him.  "Do I gotta get a
restraining order?  'Cause I'll do it!  It's over between us!"</p>

<p>"Y'see, that's where you're wrong," Riley snarled at Buffy, his face contorting into features
Buffy saw all too often.  The enlarged brow, the feral glow of the eyes, the fangs.  Riley had
been Turned.</p>

<p>"It's not over between us, Buffy," Riley continued, as Buffy managed to free her arm from his
grip. "I've changed.  And once I show you how much I've changed, I'm sure you'll agree that
it's for the better."  Riley stalked toward Buffy, grinning a feral grin.  "You're going to make
an incredible vampire, lover."</p>

<p>As Vamp-Riley stalked closer to Buffy, she let out an exasperated sigh, and muttered to
herself, "The end of a perfect day!"</p>

<p align=center>--Indigo Girls "Closer To Fine"</p>

<p>"Get your--" Scissor kick to the head.  "--slimy paws--" Jab to the kidneys.  "--off me!"
Uppercut to the jaw.  Buffy nodded with grim satisfaction as the monster that bore the face of
a man she once loved fell hard on the sidewalk. No, not love, she mentally corrected herself,
lust.  No, not even that, just hiding from my feelings for Willow.  She ended that line of
thought quickly; she didn't have time to deal with it.  First, she had to eliminate this newbie
vampire who, just two days ago, was a man named Riley Finn.</p>

<p>"Yeah, baby," Finn taunted her.  "How did you know I like it rough?"</p>

<p>"Just lie still and die, monster," Buffy growled, reaching for a nearby sign, advertising some
mayoral candidate.  Ripping the signpost off the sign, she brandished it as a makeshift stake.</p>

<p>"Now, y'see," Riley smiled, showing his needle-tipped canine teeth, "I'm hurt.  After all I did
to become what you always wanted, what turns you on in a man."</p>

<p>"You mean--" Buffy could feel her jaw drop, imagining that she looked like Wile E. Coyote
after watching the Road Runner shift into third and leave him in the dust.  "You wanted to
become a vampire?  Man, you're even dumber than I thought!"</p>

<p>"Hey," Riley shrugged his shoulders, "What can I say?  You clearly wanted that Pretty Boy
from L. A., I finally figured it out!  Buffy, the Vampire Layer!"  Riley started to laugh viciously
at his crass joke.</p>

<p>His laughter stopped when Buffy rammed her fist into his left eye, sending him flying again.
"Riley, get a clue!  I would never take you back if we were the last two people on Earth!"</p>

<p>"And after all the work I did to make him the man he is today--" Buffy heard the all-too
familiar voice behind her.  She spun on her heel, ignoring the injured vampire behind her, and
found herself looking into the face of insanity.  The dark red-brown hair, the glassy eyes
devoid of reason, the child-like expression of her mouth and chin.  A facade of innocence,
hiding a devious, deranged mind.</p>

<p>"Drusilla," Buffy identified her nemesis.  "You Turned him?"</p>

<p>"He wanted me to, didn't he, Miss Edith?" she happily cooed, talking to the rag doll she
constantly carried with her.  "How could I resist such a sweet face?"</p>

<p>"Man, talk about one egg roll short of a combo platter," Buffy muttered as she adapted a
compact crouching stance, preparing to strike at Drusilla.  Before she could attack, however,
she was blindsided by Riley.  Damn, she cursed herself.  What the hell am I thinking?  She
knew her problem, she was distracted by her recent revelations at Shepherd's Meadow.  The
love, the passion, she felt for both her best friend Willow, and Willow's lover Tara.  And that
distraction may have cost her her life.</p>

<p>"Nobody makes a move against my Sire," Riley glared at the felled Slayer.  </p>

<p>Drusilla clapped her hands with glee.  "Do it some more, do it some more!" she shrieked,
reminding Buffy of a vampire cheerleader.</p>

<p>"Go to hell, both of you!" Buffy gritted her teeth as she tried to stand.  "I will never join you!"</p>

<p>Riley laughed acidly.  "I don't recall offering you a choice in the matter, Buffy."  He grabbed
the disoriented Slayer by the neck, and pinned her to a tree.  "Just relax, Buffy.  It'll be all
over in a minute.  I take from you, you take from me, then we'll be together forever!"  He
leaned in toward Buffy's corotid artery, and allowed his fangs to puncture her skin.  Drusilla
laughed merrily as Riley started to drink.</p>

<p>"BACK OFF!" a voice shouted, causing Riley and Drusilla to turn their heads.  Willow and
Tara stood before them, each carrying a dead stick of wood.  Willow lunged at Drusilla,
clipping her throat with the stick, and landed catlike on her feet, before she had the time to
wonder how she pulled it off.  Tara took the lead from there, grabbing Riley under his ribcage
and tossing him like a sack of wheat away from Buffy.  Willow dove toward Riley, and
plunged the stick she was carrying into his chest.  He howled with rage for a second, then
dissolved into ash.</p>

<p>"We have to go, Miss Edith," purred Drusilla, clutching her doll to her.  The psychotic
vampire fled the scene, disappearing into the dark between the too-widely spaced lampposts
that lined the street.</p>

<p>Tara started to run after her, but Willow stopped her.  "No, Tara.  Buffy's in trouble."  Tara
rejoined Willow, who knelt beside the fallen Slayer.  "Riley was going to turn her," she
stammered, her grief a palpable force within her, "and he started to drink--" Willow couldn't
say anymore, and she didn't need to; Tara could see what was wrong.  Two holes in Buffy's
neck, the blood seeping out, bright and crimson, and too fast for Willow and Tara to staunch
easily.</p>

<p>"You told me that B-Buffy heals faster than m-most," Tara said nervously.</p>

<p>"Normally," Willow lamented, as she pressed her hand to Buffy's neck, hoping to stop the
blood from exiting her wounds.  "But she's lost so much blood already, I don't know if she
can--"</p>

<p>Tara scooted around, and cradled Buffy's head in her lap.  "We can help her, Willow.  Keep
her warm, keep her safe,"  Tara said, feeling the same anguish that Willow felt at the prospect
of losing Buffy.  She innately knew without knowing why, that she now felt as strongly about
Buffy as she felt about Willow.  She loved both of these women as deeply as she had ever
loved anyone.  And somehow, she knew that Willow both returned that love, and shared
their own love for each other.  And now, that knowledge gave her hope.  She looked at
Buffy's neck and suddenly saw that hope validated.</p>

<p>"I should call 9-1-1," Willow offered, but Tara hushed her gently.  "No, Willow.  We don't
need to."  Willow looked at Tara, stunned that she could suddenly be so calm, but Tara still
held Buffy's head gently in her lap, and smiled at Willow.  "The three of us, Willow.  The
bond we share.  The love we share.  We're helping  her already.  Look."  Willow glanced at
the puncture wounds on Buffy's neck, and noticed that they were already smaller, the blood
flow had stopped.  Willow had observed Buffy's body healing before; she had seen Buffy
walk into their dorm with a nasty gash on her arm one night, and waking up the next morning
she saw that the gash had closed completely, with only the slightest scarring.  But seeing the
punctures literally shrink and close before her eyes-- she looked at Tara again, saw the sly
knowledge in her eyes, and suddenly knew.</p>

<p>Buffy, Willow and Tara had performed a ritual that would allow them to ask the Fates why
they were bonded together after Willow's enjoining spell should have worn off.  The Fates
showed them a single cord, braided from three threads, the threads of their lives.  Now they
understood; their threads were interwoven together, into one single whole, a cord that was
stronger than the three threads individually.  And by this bond, they could lend their strength
to each other as needed.  Even without willing it, apparently.</p>

<p>Willow nearly wept with relief, as her best friend began to heal her wounds.  "She'll be okay
now," Tara assured her.  "All we can do is be there for her when she comes to."</p>

<p>"And we will be there for her," Willow agreed, her words were a vow.  "Always."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>She floated in a void.  No land, no sky, just emptiness.  She had no idea which way was up,
and trying to stand when there was no surface for her feet to land on was pointless.  She had
a vague idea who she was, but little details like her name escaped her.</p>

<p>She drifted, her thoughts hazy and indistinct.  She recalled seeing someone whom she loved,
now someone she hated.  She recalled how he had changed, become evil, become--</p>

<p>Vampire.</p>

<p>She bolted upright, if only in relation to the rest of her body.  Vampire.  Enemy.  Slayer.  She
was the Slayer, the memory coalesced in her mind with crystal clarity.  She was the Slayer,
the Chosen One--</p>

<p>Buffy.</p>

<p>She knew what happened now.  Riley Finn, the man she foolishly thought could make her
forget her feelings for Willow, had become a vampire, and tried to Turn her.  Had he
succeeded?  She was floating in some unknown space, was this her soul wrenched from her
body?  Was she dead?</p>

<p>She heard sounds around her.  Calling to her, entreating her.  She pivoted slowly, toward the
voices.  The voices were exotic and familiar at the same time, inviting her to an unknown
country, while simultaneously summoning her home.</p>

<p>"Buffy, come to us," the sweet birdsong voice of Willow called to her.  She craned her neck
to see her friend.  Willow hovered in front of her, her naked body bending toward her, her
hand outstretched.  Next to Willow, Tara was likewise denuded, and neither girl seemed
ashamed or self-conscious about their state of undress.  A cursory glance at her own body
revealed that Buffy was also naked.</p>

<p>Willow held Tara's body next to her with her left arm, while beckoning to Buffy with her right.
Tara held her free arm out to Buffy as well.  "Come back to us, Buffy," Tara joined her lover
in welcoming Buffy.  "We are not complete without you."</p>

<p>"We need you back, Buffy," Willow smiled warmly.  "We love you."</p>

<p>Buffy felt her breath catch in her throat as Willow declared her love for Buffy.  Tara smiled at
Willow's declaration, and nodded in agreement.  "We do love you, Buffy," Tara whispered.
"Come to us.  Join us.  Love us."</p>

<p>Love us.  They were offering her the love they shared with each other, the hearts they had
already joined, asking her to bring them her heart as well.  She was humbled by their offer,
and knew of only one response.</p>

<p>"Yes," she breathed, taking both offered hands into her own.  "I love you.  I love you both."</p>

<p>Willow and Tara pulled Buffy toward them, and as her skin contacted with theirs in a
passionate three-person embrace, currents of electricity fired along every nerve ending in her
flesh.  Just the knowledge of their love, and their desire to share with her, was enough to send
her dizzily into sheer bliss.  It was both the most erotic experience she ever felt, and the most
holy.</p>

<p>Here, amid her two true loves, she had come home.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>"She's coming 'round," Willow said excitedly.  Tara nodded happily as Buffy started to shake
her head in Tara's lap.  Her eyes suddenly snapped open, and she took in her surroundings.
She felt her head rest on something soft and warm, and as she took in Tara's face she
realized what she was resting on.</p>

<p>"Hi, Tara," she murmured dreamily.  Tara shifted slightly, and Buffy smiled. "Oh, don't mind
me, Tara.  I'm just admiring the view."  She could see Tara's head, upside-down above her,
looking over her bosom at Buffy.  Tara blushed slightly at the compliment.</p>

<p>"Buffy," Willow's voice snapped Buffy back to the here and now.  "Are you okay?  Can you
stand?"</p>

<p>"I'll try," Buffy answered, as she slowly lifted her head from the pillow of Tara's lap.  Tara
and Willow helped Buffy steady herself as she attempted to stand erect.  She tested the
strength of her legs, and decided that she could stand without further assist.  She started to
walk, slowly, shaking off the last of the wooziness that she felt from Riley's attack.</p>

<p>"Willow," she said suddenly as she recalled Riley.  "You two okay?  What happened to Riley
and Drusilla?"</p>

<p>"Dru got away, Buffy," Willow reported sadly.  "It was 'chase her' or 'make sure you were
okay', so we chose the latter."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you did, Wills," Buffy smiled.  "We'll find her later, don't worry.  And Riley?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's dust-buster chow," Tara said animatedly.  "You should have seen Willow, Buffy.
She dropped him like she was Jet Li."</p>

<p>"Hey, you weren't exactly a slouch yourself, Tara," Willow answered.  "I'm sorry about Riley,
Buffy.  I didn't think he'd let his guard down long enough to get Turned."</p>

<p>"It's not like that," Buffy said grimly.  "He went to Drusilla.  He asked her to Turn him.  He
thought that if he were a vampire, like Angel, I'd want to be his girlfriend again."</p>

<p>Willow whistled softly.  "Wow.  Dumber than advertised."</p>

<p>"Yeah, don't remind me," Buffy groaned.  "I dated the idiot!"  Shaking her head to exorcise
the memory of what Riley tried to do to her, Buffy continued, "But what about the two of you
taking out vamps like that?  You two dropped Riley all by your lonesome, and from what I
gather you didn't even use your hoojoo on him."</p>

<p>"I guess we're sharing our skills as well as our memories, Buffy," Tara suggested.  "You said
you were able to immobilize a group of vampires the other night."</p>

<p>"You're right, Tara.  I guess I have your magic as well as my Slayer-ness now."</p>

<p>"And a little of your fighting skill's rubbing off on us," Willow mused.  "Cool."</p>

<p>Buffy said nothing, she just stared long at Willow.  The redhead stood next to Tara, her hand
resting on the blond witch's shoulder.  Buffy took in the sight of these two women, both
beautiful in their own unique way.  "God I love you two," she whispered.</p>

<p>"We know," Tara smiled. "And we love you too."  Willow nodded slowly, as she walked
toward Buffy, and reached out her hand to caress the Slayer's neck, where the bite-marks
had faded to mere indentations.</p>

<p>"And this doesn't bother you, Wills?" Buffy had to ask Willow.  There was the rub.  Willow
and Tara had a loving and passionate relationship before the three of them were bonded.  As
much as she loved them, and as sure as she was of their love for her, Buffy still felt like an
interloper on their happiness.</p>

<p>Willow looked at Buffy, her smile tinged with sadness.  "Buffy, you were the one who saw
me at Sunnydale High School, and saw someone other than the class computer nerd.  You
brought me out of my shell, you told me I was beautiful so many times I had no choice but to
believe you.  I have loved you from the first time I saw you, Buffy.  I just hid those emotions
for so many reasons, my faith, fear of losing your friendship, your love for Angel, my love for
Oz.  You showed me the door, Tara invited me to step outside.  However much I love Tara,
and I do, I will always love you as much.  Our bond didn't create my love for  you, it just
clarified it."</p>

<p>"And how can I not love Willow," Tara confessed, "without loving you as well, Buffy?  The
two of you together, your bond goes beyond any friendship, or even any ordinary love.
When Willow says she loves me, I know that she still loves you as well.  You are responsible
for the woman I love, and I love you too, for the gift of Willow, and for your own self."</p>

<p>"And I love you, Tara," Buffy answered, "for loving Willow when I was too busy with the
Initiative, with Riley and all that crap.  For making her happy when I should have been there
for her.  For giving her someone to fall in love with when Oz left her.  Willow is my heart, and
you made my heart happy."  Tears welled in her eyes as she finished.  "Is this possible, for us
to love each other like this, no jealousy, no regrets?  'Cause that's all I want.  To love you
two, to make love with you two, to be with you.  Can we really do that?"</p>

<p>Willow smiled, as she took Tara's hand in her own.  "Buffy, I want to show you something,
both of you."  She offered her free hand to Buffy, who took it without reservation.  "Close
your eyes," Willow said in a soothing voice.  Buffy and Tara did as they were told, and--</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Tara was sitting on the lawn outside of Sunnydale High School, as Willow chatted happily
about her college plans.</p>

<p>"Must be tough," Willow said, "I mean, here I am, I can do anything I want. I can go to any
college in the country, four or five in Europe if I want."</p>

<p>"Please tell me you're going somewhere with this?" Tara lamented.</p>

<p>"No. I'm not going anywhere."  Willow flashed an acceptance letter in front of Tara's eyes.</p>

<p>"UC Sunnydale?" Tara asked incredulously.</p>

<p>"I will be matriculating with Class of 2003."</p>

<p>"Are you serious?"</p>

<p>Willow beamed happily. "Say, isn't that where you're going?"</p>

<p>"I can't believe it! Are you serious?" Tara cried as she embraced Willow.  She cut off the
embrace suddenly. "Ah, wait, what am I saying? You can't."

Willow looked at Tara, puzzled. "What do you mean, I can't?"</p>

<p>"I won't let you."

Willow suddenly looked a trifle offended. "Of the two people here, which is the boss of me?"

"There are better schools," Tara argued.</p>

<p>"Sunnydale's not bad," Willow insisted.  "A-And I can design my own curriculum."

"Okay, well, there are safer schools. There are safer prisons. I can't let you stay because of
me."</p>

<p>"Actually, this isn't about you," Willow countered.  "Although I'm fond, don't get me wrong,
of you. The other night, you know, being captured and all, facing off with Faith. Things just,
kind of, got clear. I mean, you've been fighting evil here for three years, and I've helped
some, and now we're supposed to decide what we want to do with our lives. And I just
realized that that's what I want to do. Fight evil, help people. I mean, I-I think it's worth
doing. And I don't think you do it because you have to. It's a good fight, Buffy, and I want
in."</p>

<p>Tara realized that she was living one of Buffy's memories, one where she and Willow shared
their dreams, their plans.  Tara saw into Buffy's heart on the day when Buffy realized who she
truly loved.  There was only one thing left to say; </p>

<p>"I kind of love you."</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy sat alone in a darkened dorm room.  She was alone in her dark thoughts, thoughts that
she had let go of the most important person in her universe.  Her heart, her soul, her--</p>

<p>A knock at the door sent her to her feet.  She turned to answer the door.</p>

<p>Willow stood before her, her face radiant.  She carried with her a large squat candle.  Buffy
was surprised to see her; she had expected Willow to be with Oz.</p>

<p>"No candle?" she asked, smiling.  "I brought you one. It's extra flamey."</p>

<p>The two women stared at each other, an awkward silence growing between them.  Willow
broke the silence; "Tara, I have to tell you. . ."</p>

<p>"No, I understand," Buffy answered, as she realized that she was cast as Tara in the young
witch's most treasured memory.  "You have to be with the person you love."</p>

<p>"I am," Willow said simply.</p>

<p>"You mean?" Buffy blinked in surprise, in absolute joy as Willow voiced her decision.</p>

<p>"I mean. Okay?" Willow's smile was incandescent.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes." Buffy matched her smile as she blew out the candle.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy and Tara stood before each other, silent in reverence to what they had shared, through
Willow.</p>

<p>Willow had allowed them each to see into the other's mind, to recall with absolute clarity a
moment from each other's past.  Buffy had seen the moment when Willow pledged her love
to Tara, and Tara was witness to Willow's decision to follow Buffy down her dangerous
path.</p>

<p>"I had no idea," Buffy said to Tara, the tears streaming freely down her cheeks, "how much
you two love each other."</p>

<p>"As deeply as you love her, Buffy," Tara answered.  Her face was flushed, and so close to
Buffy's.  She leaned in forward, meeting Buffy's lips in a kiss.  They kissed deeply, tasting
each other, sensing their passions.  As they broke away, they turned to Willow, who watched
this tableau unfold, without jealousy, without fear of losing either of these two loves.</p>

<p>"Tara's right, Willow," Buffy felt she had to make the offer to bow out, out of respect to
Willow, one last time.  "You should be with the one you love."</p>

<p>Willow smiled warmly, with the slightest hint of a growing hunger.  "I am, Buffy," she said as
she claimed Tara's lips for a brief but hot kiss.  Breaking off the kiss, she stepped toward
Buffy, and added, "Both of them."</p>

<p>Buffy had dreamed of what Willow's lips would be like, and the reality far exceeded her
wildest fantasies.  Warm and sweet, gentle and at the same time, insistent.  The fact that Tara
was with them, holding them both in her arms as they kissed, just stoked the fire of Buffy's
passion.  Tara leaned in to the other women, and soon they had achieved a clumsy yet
pleasurable three-way kiss.  Buffy reflected that they would have to work out the mechanics
of all three of them kissing at the same time, and smiled at the thought of how much fun it
would be to experiment.</p>

<p>Finally, oxygen became an issue, and the three lovers disengaged the kiss, but still remained
close.  Buffy looked longingly into the eyes of the other two women, and breathed, "I don't
want to be alone tonight."</p>

<p>Willow grinned mischievously.  "I don't think we were considering that option, were we,
Tara?"</p>

<p>Tara nodded her head enthusiastically.  "You're a part of us now, Buffy.  What better way to
acknowledge that, than for us to make love?"</p>

<p>Buffy was aware of the goofy grin plastered on her face, but didn't care.  "Who's dorm is
closer?" she asked quickly.</p>

<p>"We'll go to our dorm, Buffy," Willow offered.  "We can move our beds together.  Besides,
Tara and I left Kitty Fantastico in the dorm, we'd better go back and feed her."</p>

<p>"I think we should get some food for ourselves," Tara suggested.  "After all, we don't want
our energy reserves to conk out at the last minute, do we?"</p>

<p>Willow and Buffy grinned evilly at Tara, and the three of them headed off, arm in arm, to the
dorm room.</p>

<p>It was going to be a night to remember.</p>

<p>
"Hey, guys, a little help here," Buffy teased as she fumbled in her purse for her dorm key.
She found the task slightly more difficult because of the Chinese take out boxes she was
balancing with one hand while she fished through her purse with the other.  "Tara, would you
please take the stir-fried beef off my hands before it lands on the floor?"</p>

<p>"Right, Buffy," Tara gingerly removed the top box from Buffy's arm, smirking slightly at the
spectacle of Buffy trying to find her key one-handed.</p>

<p>Willow gently pushed past Buffy, smiling as she produced her own dorm key.  Buffy glared at
her, asking, "Why didn't you volunteer that before?"</p>

<p>"Mainly for the entertainment value," Willow grinned puckishly.  Tara struggled to maintain a
straight face, but finally abandoned her efforts in a burst of laughter.  </p>

<p>"Oh, sure," Buffy scowled in false gravity.  "Take her side.  You know what I'm gonna do to
you two tonight?"</p>

<p>"No," Tara chimed in as she placed her load of take-out boxes on a nearby desk, "but we
can hope."  With those words, she slipped behind Buffy, wrapped her arms around the
Slayer's waist, and started to kiss the back of her neck.  Buffy leaned back, thoroughly
enjoying this treatment.</p>

<p>Willow watched the two of them for a second, before pursing her lips in a wolf-whistle.
"Hey, guys," she teased her loves, "let's come up for air, shall we?"  She looked around the
room, and asked, "Hey, Tara, have you seen Miss Kitty Fantastico?"</p>

<p>Tara glanced at Buffy's bed, and smiled. "There she is," Tara announced, "and she's made a
new friend."  Buffy looked at her bed, and grinned when saw a small black kitten curled up
next to Mr. Gordo.  Willow nodded at the sight, and went to the mini-fridge.  Pulling out a
carton of milk, she poured some milk in a small dish, and set it on the floor.  Tara went to the
bed, and nudged Miss Kitty from her sleep.  The kitten yawned and stretched, jumped off
the bed and scampered to the milk.  The three girls sat on the bed and watched the kitten lap
up the milk happily.</p>

<p>"Okay, guys, let's eat," Buffy announced as she got off the bed to grab the take-out boxes,
which she placed on the bed. "Oh, I've got cola or root beer to wash this down.  Especially
the General's Chicken, I hear that's pretty hot."</p>

<p>"Actually," Willow suggested, "I just got some new stuff from the 24-7.  In the back of the
fridge."  Buffy reached back into the fridge, and pulled out three bottles.  She read the label
on one bottle; "Eros Punch?"  She regarded Willow with a questioning leer.</p>

<p>"It's just an apple-grape drink," Willow explained, blushing slightly as Tara giggled, "with
guarna and other herbs.  Supposed to help build stamina."</p>

<p>"Well," Buffy looked at Willow with a knowing eye. "In that case, heads up." She tossed a
bottle to Tara, then to Willow.  She took her own bottle and some plates and took her seat
at the head of her bed.  Willow and Tara had pushed Willow's bed next to Buffy's so there
would be room for all three of them.  </p>

<p>Buffy sat in lotus position, her feet tucked under her legs, as she opened her bottle.  Noticing
that Willow and Tara had started sipping at their juice drinks, she lifted the bottle.  "Ladies, I
propose a toast.  To old friends and new beginnings."  </p>

<p>"Here, here," Willow and Tara touched their bottles to Buffy's and drank.  "And may I make
a suggestion?" Willow added.  "Tonight, we don't make any mention of our past romantic
experiences.  No mention of Riley, or Parker, or Angel, or Oz, or--any names you want to
add to that list, Tara?" Tara shook her head quickly.  "No, Willow, no one I can think of."</p>

<p>"Okay," Willow continued.  "Tonight, those others don't exist.  Tonight it's just the three of us.
Friends, partners, lovers, whatever you want to call us.  Whatever happens tonight, the two
of you will always be the most important people in my life."</p>

<p>"Just as I feel about the two of you," Buffy agreed.  "But before we go any further," her
statement was greeted by groans from the other two.  "C'mon guys, this is serious.  We gotta
talk about something.  About the immediate future."</p>

<p>"Well," Willow put on a mock-serious face, "I predict that our immediate future will involve
the three of us, naked and sweaty, achieving multiple orgasms." </p>

<p>"No, no," Buffy tried to continue her thought.  "I don't just mean tonight."</p>

<p>"I don't think she did either," Tara exclaimed, leering.  "At least I hope not."  Willow reached
across the bed to high-five Tara.</p>

<p>"Guys," and exasperated Slayer interrupted the two.  "If you can stop channeling Anya for a
few seconds.  What I wanted to talk about was the incident with Riley.  Yeah, I know we
agreed not to talk about our exes, but this is something we need to get out of the way now."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Willow said softly.  "I think I understand.  I mean, I was a Slayer for a few minutes
there.  When I saw what he was doing to you, I went into full Slayer mode there."</p>

<p>"And you managed to stake a vampire without even half trying," Tara agreed.  "And I'm sure
I could do the same if I had to."</p>

<p>"My point exactly.  Somehow, because of our new bond, you've got some of my skills.  I'm
thinking that sometime soon, we need to tell Giles what happened, and have him put together
some training exercises for the two of you.  Nothing as extreme as my regimen, but still,
enough that you can defend yourselves."</p>

<p>"Good idea, Buffy," Tara said.  "But you should have some new training yourself.  If we have
your Slayer skills, it seems to me that you've got some of our Wicca powers."</p>

<p>"Yeah, she's right." agreed Willow.  "You said you were able to immobilize a horde of
newbie vamps without touching them the other night, right?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, you're right," Buffy remembered the incident.  That, and the empathic bond that
caused her to become aroused while Willow and Tara were making love, prompted the three
of them to start exploring why this bond was forged.  The one answer that was clear to them
was that the bond was meant to be, as was the love between the three of them that resulted.</p>

<p>"Okay, guys," Buffy continued.  "We talk to Giles, and get his reaction."</p>

<p>"Probably something like, 'The three of you are WHAT?'", Tara announced in a credible
impersonation of Buffy's former Watcher.  This brought a fresh round of laughter from the
others.  </p>

<p>"Seriously," Buffy went on once she was able to get over her laughing fit.  "That's another
issue we have to address.  How do we explain our relationship with the others?"</p>

<p>"Well," Willow mused, "I figure Xander will need a long cold shower, while Anya won't even
bat an eye.  I swear that she wouldn't notice if she saw a goat in the bed.  Not that I want to
test that theory out anytime soon."</p>

<p>"I think we should be honest about us," Tara suggested.  "After all, we're not sleeping around,
it's just the three of us.  We've got this connection, it's going to show, I say we let them know
what's happening."</p>

<p>"You're right, Tara," Willow admitted.  "The biggest mistake I made this year was trying to
keep us a secret from the rest of the Scooby Gang.  I nearly lost you over that, Buffy.  And
we can trust the others.  Whatever happens, they'll support us.  I still want to wait until we
spring this on our folks, though."</p>

<p>"Good idea," Buffy agreed.  "My mom's probably not a problem though.  Once she got used
to me being the Slayer, I figure anything else is a non-issue.  Your mom, on the other hand,"
she pointed to Willow, "can't even get my name right.  She never liked me before, I doubt
that this will change her opinion of me.  I figure we just tell Giles and the others, and anything
after that, we take it one day at a time."  Willow and Tara nodded in agreement, and Buffy
announced, "Okay then, enough of the serious stuff.  Let the party commence!"</p>

<p>Taking a pair of chopsticks in hand, Buffy started scooping out fried rice on each plate, and
passed the plates out to the others.  Willow and Tara started to serve themselves from the
other boxes, sampling stir fried beef, sweet and sour chicken and tempura fried prawns.
Tara was a little clumsy with her chopsticks, but Willow was able to teach her how to use
them.  Buffy noticed that Willow held Tara's hand in the appropriate position to hold the
sticks, and started to laugh.  "Any excuse to hold hands with her, huh, Wills?"</p>

<p>Willow cocked an eye at Buffy.  "Jealous?"</p>

<p>"Only that I didn't think of it first," Buffy grinned, biting into an egg roll.  </p>

<p>"Ooh, poor baby," Tara sympathized with Buffy, as she scooped up a piece of shrimp with
her sticks, and fed it to Buffy.  </p>

<p>The three of them continued to enjoy their dinner, occasionally feeding each other, first with
their chopsticks, then with their fingers, licking and kissing each other's fingers as their meal
took on a more sensual air.  Finally, after most of their dinner was consumed, Willow passed
around the fortune cookies.  "Okay, guys." Willow announced, smiling impishly, "Once,
during my freshman year in high school,  Xander taught me something he called the Fortune
Cookie game.  When you open your cookies, you read your fortune slips aloud, but at the
end, you have to say the words, 'in bed'."  Buffy hooted in laughter and Tara blushed slightly.
"Okay, Tara, you're the guest, so you start first," Willow announced.  </p>

<p>Tara smiled as she cracked open her fortune cookie, withdrew the slip of paper, and read;
"Your physical exertions will yield rich rewards...in bed!"</p>

<p>"Oh God I hope so," Buffy chuckled, as Willow rolled on the bed, rocking with mirth.
"Okay, Wills, your turn."</p>

<p>Willow opened her cookie and read her fortune; "Fortune favors those who are
adventurous...in bed!"</p>

<p>Tara had been drinking fruit punch as Willow spoke, and suddenly found herself laughing so
hard that the punch went up her nose.  "Good one, Wills," Buffy agreed as she broke open
her cookie.  "Okay, guys, here's mine," she coughed audibly to get the other's attention.
"Happiness comes to those who hold on to their friends...in bed."  Buffy put down the slip of
paper, and smiled wickedly.  "I totally agree!"</p>

<p>The three women leaned in to each other's arms, embracing happily, thanking whatever gods
were responsible for their finding each other.  Their closeness, however, was cut short when
Buffy winced in sudden pain.  Willow looked at her friend worriedly, but Buffy shook it off.
"No big, Wills," she insisted, "just sat in lotus too long, my feet cramped up."</p>

<p>"Here, Buffy," Tara offered, scooting herself toward the edge of the bed.  "Swing your feet
over here."  She patted her lap lightly.  </p>

<p>Willow smiled at Buffy, as she slipped behind her back.  "Do it, Buffy," she urged her friend.
"Tara gives the best foot massages."</p>

<p>"I was wondering how you got that spring in your step, Wills," Buffy kidded the redhead.
She swung her legs around, and set her feet gently on Tara's lap.  Tara removed her shoes
and stockings, and started to knead at the balls of Buffy's feet.  Meanwhile, Willow slowly
slipped her hands under the collar of Buffy's T-shirt and started to massage her shoulders.
Buffy started to relax, her tension melting away under the ministrations of these two witches.
She leaned into Willow, enjoying her caresses, and leaned her head upward to steal a kiss
from her lips.</p>

<p>"Ooh," she moaned, thoroughly loving the pampering she was receiving, "I could see myself
doing this all night."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think we got other plans for tonight," Willow said, winking at Tara.  She slipped out
from behind Buffy, who protested wordlessly, and headed toward her computer, and turned
it on.</p>

<p>"Uh, Willow," Buffy groaned, still enjoying Tara's footrub, "isn't this like the wrong time to
check your e-mail?"</p>

<p>"Have faith, Buffy," Willow admonished the Slayer while she waited for her computer to boot
up.</p>

<p>"Can't.  She's in prison."  Tara groaned at the obvious double entendre. "Besides, I'd rather
have the two of you," Buffy added, grinning like a Cheshire Cat.</p>

<p>"I'm not checking my e-mail," Willow responded.  "I'm putting on my Digital Jukebox."</p>

<p>"Your what?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"It's a music program I downloaded last year.  It burns my CDs on the computer."</p>

<p>"Willow," Buffy pleaded, "you're the computer literate, not me."</p>

<p>Willow stuck her tongue out at Buffy, eliciting a chuckle from Tara.  "To 'burn' a CD," she
explained as she started the program, "means to record it directly onto a hard drive.  I
recorded my CD collection, plus some of Tara's, and a few of yours, and I apologize for not
telling you before--"</p>

<p>Buffy rolled her eyes, "You're forgiven, Wills."</p>

<p>"Thanks.  Anyway, I can now listen to my favorite music directly from the computer.  I even
sorted the separate tracks to different play lists.  I've got a list for romantic songs, some sexy
music," she blushed slightly, "and I figure we could use some inspirational music."  A few
mouse clicks later, and soon, a slow, sweet melody emerged from the computer speakers.  </p>

<p>"Ah," Willow nodded.  "Van Morrison." She turned seductively to the two women, her hips
swaying to the rhythm.  Soon, a whisky-smooth voice sang out, sweet and clear;"</p>

<p align=center>"You can take all the tea in China,<br>
Drop it in a big brown bag for me,<br>
Sail right around all the seven oceans,<br>
Drop it in the middle of the deep blue sea."</p>

<p>She crooked her finger, whispering, "Tara, let's give Buffy a show."  The blond witch got up
from the bed, and slowly joined Willow on the floor.  The two wiccans started to dance
together, Willow sliding up behind Tara, and encircling her waist with her arms.  Sinuously,
they started to rub against each other's bodies, as Willow's hands started to tug on Tara's
shirt.</p>

<p align=center>"She's as sweet as Tupulo Honey,<br>
She's an angel in the first degree.<br>
She's as sweet as Tupulo Honey,<br>
Just like honey from the bee."</p>

<p>Buffy sat mesmerized as Willow and Tara continued their dance, which quickly grew into an
impromptu striptease.  Tara turned around within Willow's arms, and started to unbutton the
redhead's top.  Willow shed her top, and started to pull Tara's top off of her shoulders.  Tara
lifted her arms high above her head, allowing Willow to remove it completely.  Willow's bra
was a simple lacy white, while Tara wore a pink bra.  Both undergarments accented their
curves perfectly, and their lean soft torsos swayed enticingly, adding to Buffy's desire.</p>

<p align=center>"They can't stop us on the road to freedom.<br>
Men can't stop us, 'cause our eyes can see,<br>
Men of insight, men in granite,<br>
Knights in armor bent on chivalry."</p>

<p>Willow cast a sidelong glance at Buffy, extended her hand, and purred, "C'mon and join us,
honey."  Buffy took the offered hand, and Willow pulled her into the center of their circle.
Buffy faced Willow, their eyes locking, staring intently at each other, their passion mounting.
Tara wrapped her arms around Buffy, and undulated behind her.  Buffy could feel Tara's
breasts gently rubbing against her back, while Willow took Buffy's left hand to her mouth,
and started to kiss and suck her fingers.  Buffy moaned at each new contact, pulling Willow
closer to her with her free hand, and kissed her hotly on her mouth.  Willow opened her
mouth, permitting Buffy's probing tongue to meet her own.  Tara leaned in closer to Buffy,
nipping and licking her earlobe.  Buffy found herself arching her back, as her arousal grew
with each new contact.</p>

<p align=center>"She's as sweet as Tupulo Honey,<br>
She's an angel in the first degree<br>
She's as sweet as Tupulo Honey,<br>
Just like honey, baby, from the bee."</p>

<p>Buffy broke off the kiss reluctantly, and looked into the bright green eyes of her friend.  "I-
I've never done this before," she whispered, her voice carrying overtones of both desire and
fear.</p>

<p>Willow smiled understandingly.  "Hey, we've only done it once." </p>

<p>"Don't worry," Tara added, as she turned Buffy's head around and leaned in for a smoldering
kiss.  "We'll figure it out together."</p>

<p>Buffy surrendered her body to her lovers.  Before she was even aware of it, her blouse was
removed by two pairs of hands, that now caressed her upper body.  The Slayer's nerves
were afire, her knees were becoming water, she was forced to drop to the bed, as Willow
and Tara joined her, never letting up on their assault.  </p>

<p>In short order, jeans, hose, bras and panties joined the pile of discarded clothing, as three
women began to explore each other.  Three bodies experienced sensations and pleasures like
they never knew before.  Three hearts achieved union.</p>

<p>And three special souls formed a connection of love and passion that would bind them
forever.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Sunlight poured through the blinds of the dorm window, dappling the room with morning light.
Buffy stretched decadently as she awoke, stopping when she realized that the two bodies
who were sharing the bed with her were still asleep.  Willow lay at Buffy's left side, and her
head was pillowed across Buffy's breasts, while Tara slept at Buffy's right side, her arm
draped across Buffy's waist.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled as she watched the two sleeping wiccans.  She could barely believe that these
two women had taken her as a lover.  She felt complete, she felt wanted, she felt wonderful.
And she felt a nibbling at her ear.</p>

<p>Willow started to stir, arching her back luxuriously.  She smiled dreamily as she looked at
Buffy.  "Hey, lover," she growled.  "Were you awake long?"</p>

<p>"Not too long," Buffy answered, as she leaned in to kiss Willow.  "Just admiring the view.
But, if I can see both your heads, then who's nibbling my ear?"</p>

<p>Willow craned her neck, looking over Buffy's head.  She laughed lightly; "Kitty Fantastico?"
The kitten was lapping merrily at Buffy's outer ear, and Buffy tried to swat K.F. off of her.
Kitty scampered off of Buffy, and toward her food dish.  "I'd better feed her," Willow
announced, as she nudged the sleeping blond next to her.  "Tara, honey, time to get up."</p>

<p>Tara shook her head groggily as she slowly regained consciousness.  "D-don't warn the
tadpoles," she murmured.  Willow and Buffy shared a secret smile as she awakened.  They
then met Tara in the center of their bed and engaged her in a three-way kiss.  "Oh, yeah,"
Tara nodded.  "That's how I want to wake up from now on."</p>

<p>"I'm sure that can be arranged," Buffy agreed as she reluctantly extricated herself from the
pile of naked bodies, and started to hunt for her clothes.  "Guys, I wanted you guys to know
that last night was officially the best night of my life."</p>

<p>"Same here," Willow nodded.  "Yeah, me too," added Tara as the two of them scooted off
the bed.  </p>

<p>"No regrets?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"None at all," the other two chorused, as they took Buffy in their arms.  "We belong
together," Willow declared.  </p>

<p>Buffy, Willow and Tara stood together in this close embrace.  Buffy vaguely remembered a
long-forgotten math professor from her senior year in Sunnydale High School, who lectured
that the triangle was the most stable form of geometry.  She laughed, remembering how
unstable things got when Xander was torn between Cordy and Willow.  But this triangle, yes,
this triangle was stable.  They knew that they had to work out the nuts and bolts of making
this unusual relationship work.  But after last night, they knew that there was a rightness to
them.  A sense of predestination.  The knowledge that they were meant to be together.</p>

<p>Buffy allowed these thoughts to drift from her mind.  There would be time enough later to
confront reality.  For now, she was happy to remain in arms of her two lovers.  To revel in
this new found love, the most powerful love she had ever known.</p>

<p>Love to the third power.</p>
