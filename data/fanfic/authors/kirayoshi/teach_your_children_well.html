<p>Willow sipped dejectedly at her decaf mocha, glancing around the Sunnydale
Mall's Food
Court and wondering what happened to that wonderful Saturday that she,
Buffy and Mrs.
Summers were supposed to be spending together.  One half-hour inside
the mall, shopping
for maternity clothes, and she and Buffy were at each other's
throats.</p>

<p>Okay, maybe it wasn't that bad, but dammit, it seemed that bad to
her.  She knew with all
her heart and soul that she loved Buffy, that her love was returned, and
that they both were
excited by the prospect of becoming parents.  Unfortunately, she was
the one who was
pregnant, with all the positive and negative baggage that came with
it.  Her moods were
erratic, and every little upset was magnified a hundred-fold.  And the
person most likely to
get caught in the blast of Mount Saint Willow was Buffy.  Like what
happened fifteen minutes
ago.</p>

<p>And of course, to top it all off, her figure had finally begun to show
physical signs of her
pregnancy.  Her belly wasn't rounded much, not yet, but already she
had to struggle to fit into
her blue jeans.  She was starting to feel heavier, more bloated, and
there was Buffy, just as
dazzling, just as svelte, just as beautiful as ever.  Just to make the
comparison worse.</p>

<p>Fine, then, Willow thought testily, next time, Buffy can try to decipher
that damn spell
get pregnant herself!  She regretted the thought almost as soon as she
thought it.  She didn't
blame Buffy for what had happened.  Neither of them had any idea what
Willow's leafing
through that spell book would unleash.  Nor, if they had known, would
they have changed a
thing.  One single spell had brought out the passion, the love that
they had always felt but
feared to say.  Now they were together, and nothing would change
that.  Willow was, on the
whole, happier than she had been in her life, she had Buffy, she had Mrs.
Summers' support,
and she had a new life to care for.</p>

<p>But she still didn't have her parents' support and it hurt her.  When
she told them about her
pregnancy, they exploded.  They refused to entertain the notion of her
keeping the baby, and
almost insisted that she give it up for adoption.  In retrospect, she
was glad that she didn't
mention the minor fact that the father of the child, and the person she
loved more than life
itself, was a woman.  They would have had coronaries on the
spot.</p>

<p>Thank whatever God or Goddess was responsible for Joyce Summers.  She
was more open
to her daughter's relationship with Willow, and understanding of their
impending motherhood.
More than likely, dealing with the fact that her daughter was a Vampire
Slayer may have
conditioned her to accept pretty much anything.  Thankfully, she had
accepted Willow.  She
didn't even mind(too much, at least) when, after Willow and Buffy moved
back into Buffy's
old room at home, she had caught them in bed, naked as the day they were
born, luxuriating
in what could only be described as an incredible afterglow.  Mildly
awkward having dinner
with her later, but she seemed cool.  The two lovers had promised to
make sure the doors
were locked the next time.</p>

<p>She took another sip of mocha, lost in her thoughts, when she sensed
someone sitting in the
chair next to hers.  "Hey, Willow," a familiar, mature voice greeted
her.</p>

<p>Willow turned to acknowledge the speaker.  "Hey back, Mrs.
Summers."</p>

<p>"Willow," the older woman smiled, "I think that at this point in our
relationship you might as
well start calling me 'Joyce'.  I mean, you're carrying my
grandchild.  You're practically my
daughter-in-law."</p>

<p>"Thanks, M--Joyce."  She went back to sipping her mocha.</p>

<p>"You haven't seen Buffy, have you?" Joyce asked.</p>

<p>Willow looked up, glanced around the mall, saying, "I think she said
something about heading
to the WB Store.  New shipment of 'Charmed' t-shirts."</p>

<p>"Oh," Joyce pursed her lips.  She looked closely at Willow's face,
studying the worry lines
that were etching her normally elfin features.</p>

<p>"Okay, Willow, let's try this again.  What's going on?"</p>

<p>Willow paused, and considered turning her head away from Joyce.  "We
had a fight."</p>

<p>"A fight?"</p>

<p>"Not even a fight, really," Willow started, "more like a squabble.
But with definite fight
overtones."</p>

<p>"Ah.  And what was the fight about?"</p>

<p>"She got on my case for buying a candy bar."</p>

<p>"A candy bar?" Joyce asked, mystified.</p>

<p>"Hey, I know that this doesn't sound big, but chocolate is--well,
chocolate!"</p>

<p>'Don't I know it?" Joyce smiled.  "When Buffy's father and I broke up,
I went through so
many candy bars, I got Christmas cards from Hershey,
Pennsylvania."</p>

<p>Willow chuckled at the thought.  "But Buffy got on my case about
it.  Too much caffeine, she
said.  Bad for the baby."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, chocolate does contain some caffeine, but not that
much."</p>

<p>"Yeah!  That's what I said," Willow defended herself, then fell
silent.  "Of course, I said it real
loud, and real mad.  Geez, I hate hormones."</p>

<p>"Hey, been there, done that," Joyce kidded.  "It's part of the
package.  The miracle of birth
does come with certain side-effects."</p>

<p>"Yeah, my mom always said that if men had the babies, the population would
drop off
dramatically.  Couldn't stand the mood swings, or the pain of
labor."</p>

<p>"No, I always thought that if men could become pregnant, they'd make a big
macho show
about it.  You know, 'Hey Steve, I was in labor for 12 hours!
Beat that!'."</p>

<p>Willow started to laugh loudly at the image.  "Scary visual place,
Joyce."  Joyce patted
Willow on the hand, and Willow smiled.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it, Willow," Joyce assured her.  "Buffy's not going
to let a candy bar
come between the two of you.  I've never seen Buffy so happy as she's
been these last few
weeks with you."</p>

<p>"Yeah, and chocolate issues aside, she's been great about taking care of me
and the baby.
Making sure I eat my veggies, keeping me off of alcohol.  Of course,
she's had no problem
steering away from beer, since the Cave Slayer incident--"</p>

<p>"Hold it," Joyce interrupted, "the Cave Slayer incident?"</p>

<p>Willow blushed crimson, realizing that she was treading on an issue which
Buffy didn't inform
her mother.  "Uh, long story.  And rather funny in
restrospect."</p>

<p>"I'm sure," Joyce commented skeptically.  "Anyway, you've been just as
good for her.  I'm
grateful that you're a part of her life."</p>

<p>"Hey, it's easy for me, I love her so much."  Willow looked back at
Joyce, saying, "And I can
only hope that I'm as good a mom to my baby as you've been to
Buffy."</p>

<p>Now it was Joyce's turn to be silent.  She said nothing in responce to
Willow's statement,
prompting Willow to ask, "Is something wrong?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Willow," Joyce said.  "It's just that I think you could shoot
higher than me as a role
model."</p>

<p>"Joyce?  Don't say that," Willow scolded.  "Given all that's
happened, I think you did good as
a mother."</p>

<p>"Yeah, right," Joyce muttered, almost to herself.  "Hmph.  'If
you walk out that door, don't
even think about coming back'."</p>

<p>"Wha--"</p>

<p>"That's what I said to her," Joyce admitted painfully.  "It was when
she first told me that she
was the Slayer.  She had to confront Angelus, something about saving
the world from a
demon or something--"</p>

<p>"Alcatha," Willow supplied the monster's name.  She remembered Buffy's
battle with the one
she once loved, all too well.</p>

<p>"Yeah, whatever, the point was that she needed me to understand, and I was
too busy feeling
betrayed to even notice.  I found out that Buffy was leading this
whole other life, one that I
couldn't be a part of, and--well, I didn't take it very well."</p>

<p>"Yeah, Buffy told me about your blow-out.  Hey, this isn't the kind of
thing that's covered in
the Mother's Handbook."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it.  Look, Willow, there is no etched-in-stone set of
rules for parenthood.
Babies don't come with instruction manuals.  Although if they did, I
think the first page would
read, 'Don't blow up at your kid and kick her out of the house', in a very
large typeface.</p>

<p>"Look, Willow, take some advice from someone whose made her share of
mistakes.  If I
could give you one good piece of advise--"</p>

<p>"Wear sunscreen!" Willow chimed in.  "Sorry, couldn't
resist."</p>

<p>Joyce smiled at Willow and continued.  "Willow, no matter how much you
and Buffy love
your child, there will be times when your child will bug the hell out of
you.  Homework issues,
curfews, he or she decides to join a band, she's the next Slayer,
whatever.  No matter what
the crisis is, always speak from your heart.  Never speak from your
anger.  It was my anger
that nearly lost me Buffy that night.  And I swore that I'd never do
again."</p>

<p>"Is that why you've been so cool about me and Buffy?"</p>

<p>"Part that," Joyce admitted.  "But mostly because you've made her
happier than anyone else
ever has."</p>

<p>"Yeah.  And I owe her a big-time apology," Willow decided.</p>

<p>"Trade ya apologies," a chipper voice caught Willow from
behind.   Willow turned around
and grinned broadly at the sight of Buffy.</p>

<p>"Hey, Buffy, I'm sorry about--" Willow started, but Buffy held up her hand,
silencing her.</p>

<p>"No, Wills, I'm the bad in this scenario.  I shouldn't have given you
such a hard time about
some candy bar.  I just had a mental image of our baby revving around
your womb like it
was at Nascar."  Buffy held her hand behind her back as she spoke,
then suddenly took her
hand forward, handing Willow a box.  "Here.  A piece
offering."</p>

<p>Willow looked at the box, and her eyes widened.  "A Tobler
Orange!"</p>

<p>"Hey, nothing but the best for my girl," Buffy announced.  Watching
Willow tear into the box,
she added, "Save some for later, that's about five candy bars worth in
there."</p>

<p>Willow unwrapped the foil-covered ball, revealing twenty chocolate
wedges.  "I'll save some
for tonight," Willow promised, and Buffy definitely caught a wicked gleam
in her lover's eye.
"I'll even share some with you, if you ask nicely."</p>

<p>Buffy couldn't help but chuckle evilly at the implied erotic promise.
Her chuckle turned into a
coughing fit as she caught sight of her mother.  "Sorry, Mom, just
chatting," she grinned,
adding under her breath, "awkward, awkward."</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Buffy," Joyce assured her.  "Just make sure you lock
your door when you, uh,
hmm, have your chocolate."</p>

<p>"Right," a mortally embarassed Slayer said, as Willow's face turned redder
than her hair.</p>

<p>"Okay, now that the Chocolate War is over," Joyce said, "How about I take
my three
favorite girls out to lunch?"</p>

<p>"Three?  Oh," Willow remembered.  "You seem assured about our
daughter's gender."</p>

<p>"Hey, you don't have a Y-chromosome," Joyce observed, "Buffy doesn't have a
Y-
chromosome; as you two have been known to say, do the math!"</p>

<p>Buffy looked at Willow and said, "She's got a point."</p>

<p>"Okay, lunch, then we'll finish shopping for maternity wear.  We
haven't checked out the
Gap, have we?"</p>

<p>"I don't think they have maternity wear, do they?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't they?" Buffy commented.</p>

<p>"You ever see a pregnant woman jump, jive and wail on one of their
commercials?" Willow
observed.</p>

<p>"I've never seen you jump, jive and wail, either."</p>

<p>"How about tomorrow night at the Bronze?"</p>

<p>"You're on!"</p>

<p>Joyce looked at the two lovers and smiled.  Buffy had Willow and all
was right in the world.
But one thing was still bugging her.</p>

<p>"Buffy," she asked, "What exactly was this 'Cave Slayer'
incident?"</p>

<p>Buffy said nothing, she only glared at her beloved.</p>

<p>"Oops."</p>
