<!-- Somewhere I Have Never Travelled \ Chapter 1: Willow, Weep For Me -->

<p align=center><i>somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond<br>
any experience, your eyes have their silence;<br>
in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,<br>
or which i cannot touch because they are too near</i></p>
<p align=center><i>your slightest look easily will unclose me<br>
though i have closed myself as fingers,<br>
you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens<br>
(touching skillfully, mysteriously)her first rose</i></p>
<p align=center><i>or if your wish be to close me, i and<br>
my life will shut very beautifully, suddenly,<br>
as when the heart of this flower imagines<br>
the snow carefully everywhere descending</i></p>
<p align=center><i>nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals<br>
the power of your intense fragility: whose texture<br>
compels me this the colour of its countries,<br>
rendering death and forever with each breathing</i></p>
<p align=center><i>(i do not know what it is about you that closes<br>
and opens; only something in me understands<br>
the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)<br>
nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands</i></p>

<p>Nietzsche once wrote that when you gaze into an abyss, the abyss gazes back
into you.
While I'm not one to take advise from someone who inspired Adolf Hitler, I
can say that he
was right on the money with that observation. I have stared into my
own abyss many times.
Hell, my hometown was built on an abyss. And only now can I tell
others about it. And I
have to tell the the world. It needs to know the truth about
her. About Buffy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember when it all started. When we fought the greatest
battle of our lives, against
the monster Adam. The battle that had cost the world its protector,
its Slayer.
The one whom I loved more than anyone else in the world, Buffy
Summers.</p>
<p>It was over a year ago, and only now do I have the courage to write
about her. Who she
was, what it was like to lose her, and what I had to go through to find her
again.</p>
<p>Before I get bogged down in angsty thoughts, let me just say that my story
does have an
upbeat ending. Well not really an ending, per se, since it's not over
yet, and I hope it won't
be for a long time. I went through Hell, both literally and
figuratively, to get to where I am
right now, I'm not going to lose what I have now.</p>
<p>Geez, even when I write I babble.</p>
<p>I guess that the reason I'm telling you that there is a happy ending is
because I don't want to
lose your interest right away. This is an important story I'm
writing, even if it will never see
publication in my lifetime. It's about the most important person,
IMHO("in my humble
opinion" for those who don't know cyberspeak), of the twentieth
century. Her name is Buffy
Summers, and you who are reading this story owe her your life. She
has literally saved you,
not to mention the rest of humanity, from the most terrible evils
imaginable. And in the
immortal words of Han Solo, "I can imagine quite a bit!"</p>
<p>Reading that last paragraph, it looks like I'm overstating Buffy's life
just a tad. I'm not. Buffy
Summers has quite literally saved the world at least six times that I know
of. If you're alive
today, it's because she has busted her butt to protect the world from the
things that go 'bump'
in the night.</p>
<p>And I of all people can say that. My name is Willow Rosenberg, and
I've been there beside
Buffy from shortly after Day One. She's been my friend, my
confidante, my sparring partner,
my college roommate, and finally my lover.</p>
<p>How does Giles put it? "In every generation there is the Chosen
One. She alone will stand
against the vampires, the demons and the forces of darkness. She is
the Slayer." That was
Buffy's destiny; the Slayer. Yes, virtually every myth, every
creature of your nightmares, they
all exist, or existed at one time. And my hometown of Sunnydale was
Ground Zero for these
beasties. Sunnydale was built over a Hellmouth, a portal to Hell
which brought forth all
manner of nasties. Really bad zoning, right? Apparently these
vampires and other demons
existed for as long as humanity, if not longer. And as long as
humanity existed, a select
handful of young women have had the capability to fight off the forces of
Hell. And Buffy, I
figure, was the best.</p>
<p>How do I know this? Personal experience. I've seen her execute
moves that would make
Michele Yeoh envious, turning whole platoons of vamps into piles of ash
with a well placed
spike or a volley of crossbow bolts. I could tell you stories about
the Master, Angelus,
Mayor Wilkins and the Ascension, Belial and Adam, that would freeze your
blood. No one
had ever faced evils like them before. But Buffy did. She not
only faced them, but at the
end, she was the only one who walked away from any of them.</p>
<p>Except Adam. She didn't walk away from that one. But that's
getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>Goddess, it seems like a lifetime ago. Cordelia and her follower
Harmony had been giving
me grief about my wardrobe again("the softer side of Sears", my pagan
ass!), when a blond
woman about my height shows up and tells Cordy and Harmony off! Then
she asks me for
some help with her homework. That was how I met Buffy. That was
about six years ago.
The day that my world, or at least my understand of the world, changed
forever.</p>
<p>Soon, I found myself hip-deep in horror-movie extras, watching this same
blond girl make
like the Terminator, dusting them right and left. Not long after
that, I, along with my
childhood friend Xander, my werewolf boyfriend Oz, and Xander's girlfriend
Cordelia (yes,
the same Cordy, go figure), fought the good fight alongside her. I
saw and learned so much
then; I met the cursed Angel, Buffy's first love, a vampire with a
soul. I faced down the
demonic Anya, the rogue slayer Faith, and my own vampiric double. I
learned from Giles'
girlfriend, Jenny Calendar(may God give her peace) about my own innate
talent for magic,
and began the long journey to becoming a true witch. All because a
woman named Buffy
Summers became my best friend.</p>
<p>Things changed again when we attended college together. Xander didn't
have the grades to
make it into college then, so he drifted from job to job. Oz and I
had drifted apart, he met up
with a female werewolf, and even after she died, he decided to leave
me. Losing him
devastated me briefly, but Buffy was always there. Always ready to
give me a shoulder to
cry on, even when I was giving off weapons-grade bitchiness. She
loved me like no one else,
and before long I realized that I loved her. We just were so used to
being best friends that it
hadn't occurred to us that we were more. But we were. It was
during the Belial fiasco that
we were able to confide our love for each other, and once the Belial threat
was eliminated,
Buffy and I began our real relationship. She and I made love for the
first time that night,
reveling in the new sensations, new pleasures, new emotions we were no
longer ashamed to
show. We were thick as thieves since then. Inseparable.
We made plans during spring
quarter to pool our resources to rent an apartment together. To live
together.</p>
<p>As usual, however, the Hellmouth had other ideas.</p>
<p>When did it start to go downhill? When Buffy started to investigate
the Initiative, a shadow-
ops organization that apparently was funded by the government to fight
supernatural evils,
kind of a vampire X-Files? When Maggie Walsh, the Initiative's senior
commander, set up
Buffy to be taken by an army of zombies? When her creation Adam, a
cross between a
demon and Locutus of Borg, broke free and killed her, then started
recruiting all the vampires
and demons in Sunnydale to help him destroy humanity?</p>
<p>I think that the blackness really started when Oz returned. He
claimed that he had gained
control of his werewolf side, and he wanted me back. By this time,
Buffy and I were
apartment hunting together, so I told him that what we had was long gone,
and that I loved
Buffy. He smiled, said simply that he understood, wished the two of
us luck, and left. I
remember Buffy looking at Oz as he left, and the expression on her face was
one of supreme
doubt. I've seen that look before, when what she called her
spider-sense started going off.
Something was wrong with Oz. </p>
<p>Then came that one day. One very bad day.</p>
<p>Buffy had gotten a hot tip from a mysterious demon named Whistler that Adam
was planning
something big at the rim of the Hellmouth, just outside of Sunnydale.
Naturally the Scooby
Gang was with her when she investigated, and Oz was with us. For a
little while, it was just
like old times; Xander, Oz, Buffy and me. Along with Tara, a good
friend of mine, who had
helped me gain control and confidence in my wiccan powers. Tara and I
had just discovered
a spell that would allow us to seal the Hellmouth forever, so Buffy's plan
was to push Cyber-
creep into the Hellmouth and close it behind him.</p>
<p>Adam, apart from looking like he was cobbled together from a morgue's spare
parts,
possessed a computer-like mind, complete with a disc-drive on his
chest. He absorbed
information by downloading discs. I had used my computer hacking
skills to encode a
special computer virus onto a disc, which Buffy would plant into Adam's
drive. The virus
would then play havoc with his memory, his motor skills, you name it,
giving Buffy the
opportunity to send him through the Hellmouth.</p>
<p>Sure enough, there was the Frankenstein monster's uglier brother using some
kind of spell to
drain off power from the Hellmouth, power that would make him
invincible. We tried to stop
him, but an army of demons stood between us and Adam. We had tough
going at first, but
we managed to thin out the demon horde(we of course meaning Buffy mainly,
but the rest of
us got our licks in). Finally Buffy confronted Adam, and they traded
blows.
Adam fought savagely, intent on the kill, while Buffy took a defensive
stance, pacing herself,
waiting for Adam to do something stupid. He obliged us by letting his
anger get the better of
him. He lunged repeatedly at Buffy, telegraphing his attacks enough
for Buffy to evade them.
Finally, she had enough of this dodge-and-duck game, so she dove low toward
Adam, who
tried to block her path. She got under him, then with lightning speed
she body-checked him
with her right shoulder. As he tumbled to the ground, she whipped out
the virus disc, and
popped it into his drive.</p>
<p>The effect was not unlike microwaving a tin can. He spasmed and
jerked around, trying to
stand, but Buffy kept kicking him, each blow sending him backward, toward
the Hellmouth
aperture he had erected. I clearly remember seeing her smile and
hearing her quip, "Tell the
Master Buffy says 'hi'," before delivering the final blow, the one that
sent Adam back to Hell.</p>
<p>Once Adam was swallowed by the Hellmouth, Tara and I recited the
spell. The spell was
working, the aperture was collapsing, and the Hellmouth was closing, when
it happened.</p>
<p>Oz, who had been fighting off demons with Xander, suddenly assumed a
transitional form,
between human and wolf, and jumped Buffy. "You shouldn't have taken
what wasn't yours,
Buff," he growled. "Don't worry, little girl, I'll take good care of
Willow!"</p>
<p>I stood there, thunderstruck, disbelieving what I was seeing. Oz, the
sweetest, kindest, most
gentle man I had ever known, had gone all Hannibal Lechter on the woman I
loved. "Oz!" I
pleaded with him. "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"Adam and I cut a deal, Wills," he snarled evilly at me, grabbing Buffy by
the throat. "I
betray Buffy, he'd give you to me as a gift. It seems that Adam lost,
so Plan B. You're mine,
Willow, and this dyke whore won't take you away from me!"</p>
<p>Xander charged at Oz, but the werewolf brushed him aside easily, clawing
him hard on the
side. Xander landed on the ground with all the grace of a wounded
hippopotamus, rolling in
pain. Seeing Buffy struggling against Oz's grip, Xander wounded by
Oz, and the look of
madness in his eyes, finally triggered me to act. With a scream of
rage, I ran at Oz, intent on
clawing his eyes out. His laughter was like the baying of a mad dog
at the moon. He
knocked me aside with his free arm, and as I landed on my butt, he lifted
Buffy off the ground
and hurled her into the closing Hellmouth. I ran to the aperture,
desperate to grab Buffy, to
somehow pull her out, but the aperture closed behind her. And Oz just
stood there, proud of
his betrayal. </p>
<p>He turned toward me, and grinned wickedly, his teeth sharp and glistening
with his saliva.
"You belong to me, Willow," he barked, stalking closer to me. His
eyes glowed with
unearthly power, with lust, with evil. The Oz I knew and once loved
didn't live in that beast
anymore. Laying on the ground where I had landed, I grasped around
me, looking for a
weapon, anything to put down this mad dog. There was nothing, not
even a small stake. I
tried to crawl away from him, but he pinned me with his knees, and began to
leer at me. In
terror, I held on to the only thing I had left of Buffy, my half of the
Mizpah coin we shared,
the piece of silver jewelry that signified our bond, our love for each
other. The bond that had
been severed by Oz's treachery.</p>
<p>A piece of silver.</p>
<p>I yanked it off of my neck, and used the edge of the coin to slash at Oz's
face. He reeled in
pain, jumping back away from me. "You slut!" he screamed, "I'll kill
you for that!"</p>
<p>"You already killed me!" I shouted, wielding the coin like a knife in front
of me. "You took
Buffy away from me! The Oz I knew wouldn't do that!"</p>
<p>"The Oz you know is dead," he growled, charging at me again.</p>
<p>"Well, why don't you join him?" I cried, throwing myself into a flying
tackle. I pounded him
back, into the ground, then before he had the time to get back up, I dug
into his neck with the
coin. I slashed deeply, hitting the carotid artery, and his lifeblood
gushed out like a torrent.
Within seconds, he had died.</p>
<p>I was only vaguely aware of events after that. I knew that Tara was
tending to Xander's
wounds, while Giles had pulled me away from the werewolf's corpse.
They had taken me
back to Giles' house, tended to my scratches and tried to feed me. I
remembered to bathe,
to clean myself, to pee when I had to, that was it. For two days, I
existed in a hazy half-life
state. Finally, the enormity of what had happened hit me; Oz,
the first person I truly loved,
had betrayed us, only to die at my hands.</p>
<p>And Buffy Summers, the one I loved more than anyone else, was gone
forever.</p>
<p>I was aware of Giles holding me as I cried. His support, his caring,
were the only things
keeping me from falling into the abyss. Xander had been standing
there beside him, offering
what little support he could, as was Tara. I just wept bitterly, not
knowing what would
happen tomorrow, and not wanting to know. Sure, we had saved the
world, once again,
allowed humanity to sleep peacefully as another demonic threat was
eliminated. </p>
<p>None of it mattered.</p>
<p>All I knew was that I had lost the love of my life. I had lost
Buffy.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, no one attended the burial of Daniel 'Oz' Ozbourne.
I had visited his
grave once, since then, to spit on it.</p>
<p>Buffy's parents were together for her memorial service. It was the
first time that I had met
her father. He wouldn't even look at me. I don't know if
he simply disapproved of Buffy
and I being lovers, or whether he blamed me for her death. He didn't
need to, I was blaming
myself for it plenty. I don't think that Joyce had said ten words to
the man during the whole
time he was here.</p>
<p>Giles delivered a eulogy for the fallen Slayer, and I could see the tear
tracks on his face. He
hadn't been this distraught since Angelus killed his girlfriend
Jenny. When I took the podium
to speak of my beloved, I recited a poem, 'Funeral Blues', by W. H. Auden,
with some slight
pronoun changes for gender;</p>
<p>"Turn off the clocks and disconnect the phone.
Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone.
Silence the piano with a muffled drum;
Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.</p>
<p>Let airplanes circle mournfully overhead,
Scribbling in the sky the message, "She is dead".
Put crepe ribbons on the white necks of the public doves.
Tell the policeman to wear black cotton gloves.</p>
<p>She was my north, my south, my east, my west,
My working week, and my Sunday rest.
My noon, and my evening, my talk and my song.
I thought that love would last forever. I was wrong.</p>
<p>The stars are not needed, shut off every one.
Put away the moon and dismantle the sun.
Tear down the ocean and sweep away the wood,
For nothing now can ever come to any good."</p>
<p>Joyce Summers led me off the podium as I wept again. She invited me
to stay with her if I
needed to, but I declined. I just wanted to be alone, and I couldn't
take her sympathy, not
when it was my fault that she had lost her daughter.</p>
<p>I had convinced Buffy that Oz was okay, that he was still one of us.
I had no idea that he
would turn against us, that he would sell us out to claim me. He was
obsessed with me, and
had used our old relationship to get close enough to Buffy to stab her in
the back. I may as
well have taken a gun to her temple and pulled the trigger. I was as
responsible for Buffy's
death as anyone. And all I could do was blame myself.</p>
<p>I had continued to blame myself for months after that, making myself more
miserable with
each passing day. Eventually the numbness wore off, and I had managed
to go on with some
semblance of a life. I returned to college, continuing my criminology
major, but I dropped the
wicca practice. I had given up on the idea of using my witchcraft to
help others, I knew that I
was no good at it. All the magic in the world couldn't save Buffy,
could it?</p>
<p>It wasn't until nearly a year after Buffy's final battle that my battle had
really begun. And what
I thought was the end, was just the beginning.</p>
