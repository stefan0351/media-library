<p>San Francisco, August, 2009;</p>

<p>"Who are you?" the fearful countenance shouted at his first slave.
The slave stood his
ground, defiantly, saying "I'm Eric!"  The demon slammed his fist onto
the slave's head, hard
enough to kill. </p>

<p>The demon approached the next slave in line. "Who are you?" he demanded of
the cowering
girl.</p>

<p>"No-nobody," she whimpered.  The demon nodded.  Good
answer.</p>

<p>The demon approached the third slave in line, a tall girl with long brown
hair.  "Who are
you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The girl looked at him; her eyes, her expression, everything about her
shouting defiance.  She
smiled at the demon and introduced herself;  "I'm Steffi.  The
Demon Killer.  And you are?"</p>

<p>The brown haired girl then proceeded to fight her way through a horde of
demon warriors,
shouting to the assembled humans whom the demons had enslaved, "Anyone
who's not
having a good time, follow me!"</p>

<p>Buffy, Willow, and Cordy sat on the sofa of the Halliwells' living room,
watching the
videotape that Cordy had brought with her, as Prue, Piper, Phoebe and Leo
looked on from
their seats.  Cordy watched with rapt attention, while Buffy and
Willow covered their eyes in
embarrassment, and the others just sat bemused.</p>

<p>"Geez, Buffy," Willow teased her fiancée, "Did you really say
that?"</p>

<p>"Hey, it sounded good at the time," Buffy defended herself.  "I mean,
the company that's
producing Cordy's show hired me on as a technical consultant, at least let
them get the
dialogue right.  Right, Cordy?"</p>

<p>"Shh, shh," Cordy hushed her friends.  "Here's my favorite
part."  The final scenes of the third
season premiere of "Steffi the Demon Killer" showed Steffi Winters
returning home after
running away from Shoredrive, away from the grief of having to send her
beloved Dominic to
Hell.  As her mother opened the door, Steffi stood there, sorrow and
penitence in her deep
brown eyes.  A troubled mother-daughter relationship was given a
second chance.  The two
women hugged.  Cut to black, and the executive producer's
name.</p>

<p>Everyone else applauded, while Cordy took a bow.  "Thank yew, thank
yew," she said,
hamming it up for all it was worth.</p>

<p>"Hey, Cordy," Willow announced, "Congratulations on another sterling
performance as Steffi
Winters, the Chosen One."</p>

<p>"Go Steffi, Go Steffi, Go Steffi!" Phoebe chanted along, moving her arms in
a boogie
rotation.  Prue and Piper looked quizzically at their sister, who just
shrugged.  "What?  I think
it's a cool show.  Good job, Cordy." The other Halliwell sisters
chuckled at Phoebe.</p>

<p>"Thanks," the actress replied.  "But I couldn't have done it without
my technical adviser,
Buffy."  She nodded toward the retired Slayer, who just acknowledged
her with an amused
glare.  </p>

<p>"You better believe it!" Buffy announced.  When Cordy had approached
her over two years
ago with the idea of basing a television series on Buffy's experiences as
the Slayer, she was
dubious at first, but ultimately warmed to the idea.  She had agreed
to help develop the show
on one condition; certain stories, certain events from her life, were never
to see the screen.
The world would never see either the more intimate encounters with
Faith(named 'Hope' on
the show), or the way Tara had betrayed Willow.  Of course, Cordy had
shown the original
prints of the episodes to Buffy, shortly before they aired.  She
brought the season premiere
with her to the party the Halliwells were holding for Buffy and
Willow.</p>

<p>"Actually, I've been butting heads with the network execs over the next
season," Cordy
admitted.  "The fans and the suits want to get Steffi back together
with Dominic, the good-
guy vampire, now that he's got his soul back and isn't the evil Dominus any
more.  But my
producer and I want to develop the relationship between Steffi and Laurel
Silverberg, maybe
even making it a romance.  Hey," she defended herself against Phoebe's
laughter at the
notion, patting Buffy on the knee.  "I've got the real Steffi and
Laurel right here, not to
mention the addresses of several Steffi/Laurel fanfiction web sites, to
back me up on this
one."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but who'd ever believe it?" Piper asked.  "Especially after the
way Steffi pined away
for Dominic." Buffy rolled her eyes, wishing not to be reminded of her past
with Angel.
"Anyway, congratulations again.  You've got a winner here."</p>

<p>"And, while we're on the subject of congratulations," Leo interjected,
raising his wine glass,
"congratulations, Buffy and Willow, on your impending nuptials."</p>

<p>"Thanks, guys," Buffy said, as the Cordy and the Halliwell sisters
applauded.  </p>

<p>"So, which one of you is the designated ball-and-chain?" Phoebe
asked.  Prue gave her a
withering stare, but smiled slightly.  Phoebe would never change,
thank the Gods.</p>

<p>"Hey, seriously, guys," Leo, always the peacemaker between his
sisters-in-law, changed the
subject.  "Who's going to come to the wedding?"</p>

<p>"Well," Buffy commented, "Mom and Giles, Willow's folks, Cordy, you guys,
Angel, Oz and
Amy-- Wills, didn't you say that Oz would play guitar at the
service?"</p>

<p>"You mean Daniel?  Yeah, and I heard him just yesterday.  He's
been practicing an acoustic
guitar arrangement of 'Here Comes the Bride'.  Sounds
lovely."</p>

<p>"Great.  Only, in this case, both of us are the brides."</p>

<p>"Hey, I'm just glad that Dad had agreed to give me away.  It took him
a while to accept that
I'm gay, but now he and Mom are cool with it.  How about your dad,
Buff?"</p>

<p>Buffy fell silent, and Willow realized her mistake too late.  "Oh,
Buffy, I'm sorry, I didn't
remember--"</p>

<p>"Hey, it's okay, Wills," Buffy hugged her wife-to-be for assurance.
To the others, Buffy
explained, "Six years ago, I confronted my dad about some of the decisions
I made over my
life.  I didn't tell him about being the Slayer, or anything like
that, but I did tell him that I loved
women, not men, that I was gay, and he didn't take it well.  I simply
told him that this is who
and what I am, and he could either accept it, or never cross my path
again."  She sighed
deeply.  "I think you can guess what he chose."</p>

<p>"Sorry, Buffy," Piper consoled her new-found friend.  "I can't imagine
any parent being so
cruel to a child."</p>

<p>"It's all right," Buffy said, but the faraway look in her eyes told Willow
that it wasn't.  "He
stopped being Dad long before that, he just didn't want the
responsibility.  His loss.  Besides,
Mom's found Giles, so she's happy now, and Giles has always been more of a
dad to me
than my father was."  She smiled and added, "besides, I've got all of
you, Mom, Daniel,
Amy, and above all else, Willow," she gave the redhead beside her a
squeeze, making
Willow grin broadly, "hey, I'm blest to have this family."</p>

<p>"Then, to family," Phoebe announced, lifting her glass.  The glasses
clinked once more, then
Buffy announced, "Well, Willow and I gotta go.  Thanks for the
preview, Cordy."</p>

<p>"You got it," Cordy said, as they saw Buffy and Willow off.</p>

<p>As Buffy and Willow strolled down the walkway, Phoebe shouted at them,
"Hey, don't forget
to swing by the P3 Thursday night.  Lauryn Hill's playing there.
Oh," she added, running
back to grab something from the coffee table.  "Willow, you forgot
your purse --UNGGHH!"
She suddenly doubled over, her head throbbing with an all-too familiar
pain.  Before her
mind's eye, a movie played; Buffy and Willow being mowed down by a speeding
car.</p>

<p>"Buffy, Willow! Stop!" she shrieked.  The two girls turned their heads
toward the young
witch, as suddenly the screech of a tire skidding over asphalt filled the
air around them.
Acting on instinct, Piper stretched out her hand, and the car froze in its
tracks, along with
most of the rest of the neighborhood, stuck in time.  Willow was
immune to the effect of
Piper's time-freeze powers, but Buffy was not; she was as stuck fast as the
car.</p>

<p>Willow glanced around her, at the stopped car which would have surely
killed both of them
had not Piper intervened.  "Oh Goddess," she muttered under her
breath.  "What happened?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Leo admitted, as he approached the street where Willow and
Buffy were
standing.  Taking Buffy by the arms, he said, "Let's just get Buffy
out of the way, before Piper
unfreezes the neighborhood."</p>

<p>Willow helped Leo lift her beloved onto the sidewalk, and nodded to Piper,
who gestured
again, and unfroze time.  The car drove off, unheeding of its speed,
tires screaming all the
way.  Buffy blinked and looked around her, asking, "Shouldn't I be
closer to our car by now?
I mean, I do understand the fundamental principals of walking--"</p>

<p>"It's okay, Buffy," Prue answered as she and her sisters gathered around
the confused ex-
slayer.  "That crazy driver nearly turned you into Flatgirl and
Ribbon.  Good thing Phoebe
had that vision about the car when she grabbed your purse."</p>

<p>"Whoa," Buffy breathed.  Willow just nodded her head in
agreement.  "But we're okay, right?
Just a near-accident."</p>

<p>"I don't know," Leo said ominously.  "I thought I saw someone inside
the car."</p>

<p>"Yeah, Leo," Cordy interjected.  "That would be the driver.
Probably a drunk driver, or
road rage or something."</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't that," Leo replied.  Piper stood beside her husband,
her protector, her
Whitelighter.  She saw the look in his eyes, recognized the tone in
his voice.  "Is it something
supernatural, honey?"</p>

<p>"It must be," Leo turned to his wife.  "The driver looked human, but I
couldn't make out a
clear picture.  Only a sense of what it was.  And it was moving
when you froze the car."</p>

<p>"Then it must be a demon or warlock, or some such," Piper reasoned.
"Which means that
someone may be out to get Buffy and Willow."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy admitted.  "It's happened before.  Demons trying to
peg the retired Slayer.
Kinda like a dare, see who can get closest to me."</p>

<p>"Hey, Leo," Prue suggested, "could you recognize that vibe you got off of
the car if you
browsed through the Book of Shadows?"</p>

<p>"Could be worth a try," Leo agreed.  He and the women headed back into
the Halliwell
mansion, and up to the attic, where Prue, Piper and Phoebe located their
family grimoire, the
Book of Shadows.  It was this book that first brought the disparate
sisters together all those
years ago, revealing their heritage as the Charmed Ones, three mighty
witches, one of the
most powerful forces of good the world has ever seen.  Buffy, Willow
and Cordy watched
on as the three witches and Leo looked through the book.</p>

<p>"Find anything, Leo?"  Piper asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Not yet," he said as he thumbed through a few more pages.  "It didn't
seem too powerful,
just malevolent.  Wait," he said suddenly as his eyes rested on a
particular page and he read
the words.  "Here we are."</p>

<p>The Halliwell sisters read over his shoulder as Willow looked on.  "A
vengeance demon,"
Leo read.  "Customarily these entities are former human beings,
particularly mages, who have
been wronged by someone.  So great is their thirst for vengeance that
they give up their
mortality, and become demons who live to wreak vengeance against those who
have
wronged others the way they were wronged."</p>

<p>"Okay," Phoebe looked down, "So much for the sales pitch, how do we
vanquish it?"  Buffy
had to smile as she heard that.  It reminded her of herself as the
slayer.  Never mind the
family history, Giles, just tell me how to slay it.  Indeed, seeing
Leo hunched over the Book
of Shadows, Buffy and Willow were reminded of a young Giles.</p>

<p>"Looks easy enough," Leo answered.  "Iambic quadrameter verse, recited
by the three of
you in unison."</p>

<p>"A power of three spell," Prue stated.  "Nothing too messy
though.  What I want to know is
why is a vengeance demon gunning for Buffy?"</p>

<p>"It's not Buffy," Willow suddenly blurted out.  All eyes looked at
her, and Willow started to
feel a little self conscious.  "It's me," she admitted
timidly.</p>

<p>Cordy looked at her old friend, concern clouding her brown eyes.  "You
think it's Anya,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Anya?" the sisters asked in unison.</p>

<p>"Anyanka," Willow stated, "was a former vengeance demon.  Buffy
stripped her of her
powers after she tortured Cordy with a twisted 'It's a Wonderful Life'
scenario.  She later
tried to draw a vampire version of me from an alternate universe.
After that, she changed her
attitude, and became devoted to our friend Xander.  In her own
twisted, oversexed way, she
fell in love with him.  When he died, I think she blamed me," and
she's not the only one, she
thought ruefully, "'cause I was dating the girl who killed her, and she
disappeared from the
face of the earth.  I guess she must have gotten her powers back and
now wants me out of
the way for Xander's death."  Her eyes were hooded and her head was
bent low, so none
could read her expression.</p>

<p>None, except for her lover and fiancée.  Buffy had seen her in this
state before, when she
blamed herself for Xander's death by the magic of Willow's ex-girlfriend
Tara.  Buffy held
Willow in her arms, and said, "Don't worry.  You didn't do anything to
hurt Xander.  And if
Anya tries anything against you, I'll show her what vengeance is really
about."</p>

<p>Willow reveled in the feeling of Buffy's strong arms around her shoulders,
but she still couldn't
shake her own guilt.  Did she kill Xander, by loving Tara?  </p>

<p>And if Anya was targeting her, would she survive?</p>

<p align=center>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>

<p>Willow woke up the next morning after a fitful sleep.  Once, the night before, she had bolted
awake after a nightmare of Anya gutting Buffy like a salmon.  Buffy had finally managed to
soothe her lover and convince her to go back to sleep.</p>

<p>Willow reached for Buffy as she awakened, but felt a cold space in the bed next to her.  That
woke her up with a start, and she leaped out of bed, grabbing her robe.  She rushed to the
living room, fearing the worst.</p>

<p>The familiar sound of Buffy's "Hiaa!" assured her that her fears were groundless.  Willow
entered the living room to see Buffy in the middle of her morning exercises.  She practiced
several simple karate katas, in repetition, and then cooled down with a series of tai chi
positions.  The fluid grace of her body, clad only in a blue sports bra and panties, were
enough to set Willow's blood racing, and help her put aside her night terrors.  She sat down
in her favorite easy chair, paying rapt attention to her lover's graceful movements.  Her cat,
Piawacket, lazily climbed the chair, and curled up in Willow's lap.</p>

<p>In the middle of a crane movement, Buffy glanced at the chair, and saw Willow sitting there,
absently stroking Piawacket.  She stopped, and smiled at her beloved.  </p>

<p>"Hey, don't stop on my account," Willow said, "I was just getting warmed up."</p>

<p>"Hey, hacker," Buffy commented.  "I'm the one doing the exercise, how can you be getting
warmed up?"</p>

<p>"You're standing there wearing next to nothing, moving like that?" Willow answered,
attempting her best sultry voice.  "You've got to be kidding me."</p>

<p>"I aim to please," Buffy grinned as she moved toward the easy chair.  "Scram, Pie," she
growled humorously, shooing the cat, as she took the feline's place next to Willow.  They
cuddled for a few minutes, Buffy grazing Willow's left earlobe, Willow kissing Buffy's
shoulder.  Buffy stopped her nibbling to ask, "You sleep any better, Wills?"</p>

<p>Willow nodded, and passed a rueful glance at Buffy.  "Not bad for a jinx," she muttered.</p>

<p>Buffy turned Willow's head to face her directly.  "Oh, no, Willow.  None of that.  You are
not a jinx."</p>

<p>"Yeah, right," Willow huffed.  "Xander loved me, now he's dead.  You love me, now you've
got a vengeance demon on your tail."</p>

<p>"Oz loved you, now he's married to Amy," Buffy joked.  "Merciful God in heaven above,
what have you done?"  She started to chuckle at Willow, who just glared at her.</p>

<p>"I'm serious, Buffy," she snapped at her fiancee.  "If I hadn't gotten involved with Tara,
Xander would be alive.  I'm bad mojo.  You get involved with me, you might as well wear a
red uniform and join a landing party on Star Trek.  I mean, who wears red military uniforms
anyway, they'd stick out like a sore thumb!  I mean, the Brits wore red, and the Colonies
kicked their butts!  Real lousy camouflage there--"</p>

<p>"Wills, you're babbling," Buffy observed.</p>

<p>"I'm babbling!  And I'm a jinx!  Buffy, if you had a brain in your head you'd run for the hills
instead of marrying me!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, Miss Rosenberg," Buffy raised her voice, causing Willow to be silenced from her
babble attack.  "It's a good thing for both of us that I'm a complete idiot.  Yep, I'm the
Scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz!"</p>

<p>"Buffy, I didn't mean--" Willow started to apologize, but Buffy placed a finger on her lips,
effectively silencing her.</p>

<p>"Forget it, Wills," Buffy said gently.  "This Anya situation has us both on edge.  But I want
you to understand something right off.  In three weeks from now, I am going to marry you,
even if I have to hog-tie you and drag you to the chapel myself.  You and I are going to be
Willow and Buffy Rosenberg-Summers.  I've loved you too long to settle for anything less.
And nothing short of another apocalypse will stop us.  You got it?"</p>

<p>Willow gasped in awe of Buffy's expression.  And she thought she had a good resolve face.
"Who am I to oppose the will of the Chosen One?"  With a heartfelt smile on her lips, she
vowed, "I'd better not miss the ceremony, then."</p>

<p>"That's my wiccan," Buffy murmured into Willow's neck.  After a few more minutes, she
reluctantly sat up, and said, "C'mon, Willow, let's get dressed.  Piper said we should swing
by their place and check on their progress in tracking Anya.  And I could use a shower."
Walking away, she turned her head toward Willow, and smiled knowingly.  "Room for one
more, honey," she whispered throatily.  The redhead grinned lopsidedly as she followed the
retired Slayer to the shower.</p>

<p align=center>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>

<p>"You failed me, little slave," the dark voice told her.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Mistress.  Forgive me," the slave begged as she groveled before the one who had
the power to forever banish her from the mortal realm. "I had no idea that their new friends
were such powerful witches."</p>

<p>"Yes, the Charmed Ones," the Mistress mused.  "I have heard of them.  Many of my brothers
and sisters were vanquished by their Power of Three.  That's why I chose not to strike at her
directly.  No matter.  The one who hurt us both will not see another sunset," she mused,
almost to herself.  "I've made arrangements."  </p>

<p>The slave stood mournfully as her mistress was lost in thought.  She had wanted revenge
against the one who cursed her forever.  But not like this, not if it meant the death of
innocents.  Her mistress didn't care who got caught in the crossfire.  And if she were to raise
a hand against the Mistress, her time on this earth would be over.</p>

<p>But would that be such a bad thing, compared to an eternity of servitude to a madwoman?</p>

<p>As the slave contemplated her fate, and her mistress planned her revenge, neither were aware
of a third presence in their midst.  This presence raged at their plans against Willow
Rosenberg.  She had been hurt enough for several lifetimes.</p>

<p>He knew that all too well.  After all, hadn't he caused a great deal of that pain?</p>

<p align=center>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>

<p>"Buffy, Willow," Prue greeted the couple.  "Come on in.  We're just waiting for Leo."</p>

<p>"Good to see you, Prue," Buffy answered as she and Willow joined the sisters in the living
room.</p>

<p>"Any word on Anya?" Willow asked pensively.</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Piper.  "Leo had left to find out something.  He should be back soon."
Shortly after Piper spoke, a cascade of light coalesced in front of them, as Leo materialized in
the living room.  "Speak of the Whitelighter," Phoebe quipped.</p>

<p>Piper hugged her husband briefly, causing Buffy and Willow to smile; after seven years of
marriage, Leo and Piper were still as passionate about each other as when they were
newlyweds.  Buffy took Willow's hand in hers, and prayed to whatever God or Goddess
happened to be listening that she and her soulmate would be as happy in their life together.</p>

<p>"Well, I've got some good news for you," Leo said, as he put a paper bag he was carrying on
the coffee table.  "I can say that your antagonist is not Anya."</p>

<p>"Wha- hold it, Leo," Buffy interrupted, "Last night, you were sure it was a vengeance
demon."</p>

<p>"A vengeance demon, maybe," Leo said.  "It was a close thing, but I know it wasn't Anya in
particular.  Anya is still human, and didn't seem to have any interest in revenge."</p>

<p>"Wait a sec, bro-in-law," Prue rose to her feet as she questioned the Whitelighter.  "You
sound like you know her."</p>

<p>"Well, we just met," Leo admitted.  "I looked up records from U. C. Sunnydale, and found
her full name, then I tracked her to her current home.  She lives here in San Francisco,
believe it or not.  Runs--well, a boutique in Haight-Ashbury."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy muttered skeptically.  "What a co-ink-y-dink!"</p>

<p>"Yeah, Leo," Phoebe admitted, "That excuse does sound as shallow as my last three dates."</p>

<p>"She doesn't have her powers, Phoebe," Leo asserted.  "And when I mentioned that I was
sent by her friend Willow, she just nodded.   She asked if Willow had finally worn down
Buffy. And she asked me to give you this," she handed the paper bag to Buffy, who could
have sworn she saw the Whitelighter blush, "as a wedding  gift."</p>

<p>Buffy carefully opened the bag, and produced a round plastic tub.  She read the label;
"Chocolate flavored body paint,"  Willow blushed almost as red as her hair.  "Same old
Anya," Buffy commented.</p>

<p>"Leo!" Piper cried in mock indignation, swatting her husband.   "What kind of boutique was
Anya running?"</p>

<p>"And that address again, Leo?" Phoebe chirped, only to receive a withering stare from Prue.</p>

<p>"I didn't stay too long," Leo admitted, somewhat embarrassed, "just enough to speak to
Anya.  She almost had to be reminded who Buffy and Willow were.  I'm pretty sure that
she's not our vengeance demon."</p>

<p>"Great," huffed Willow as she plopped down into the first available chair.  "That means we're
back to square one, with something trying to kill either me or Buffy."</p>

<p>"It really is great," Buffy countered her beloved, "because it means you're not the target.
You're not a jinx, Wills, like I said."  Willow smiled at Buffy's reassurances.</p>

<p>"As for who's targeting you now," Prue added, "you've still got the Power of Three on your
side.  We'll patrol around your townhouse, find out if you're endangered, then," she pounded
on her left palm with her right fist, to illustrate the point.</p>

<p>"Hey, I can't ask you to keep us under surveillance twenty four/seven," Willow said, as she
stood up and into Buffy's waiting arms.</p>

<p>"We won't have to," Piper brightened up.  "We've got our early warning system, namely
Phoebe."  Phoebe looked at her sister, surprised, then the idea hit her and Prue
simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I see it," Phoebe said.  "Buffy, if you have a personal item you can live without for a
while, a lipstick or a hankie or something like that."</p>

<p>"What are you, Monty Hall?" Buffy quizzed as she fished through her purse.  She withdrew a
silk scarf, and handed it to Phoebe.</p>

<p>"The very thang," Phoebe drawled.  She wrapped the scarf around her neck, and tied it
loosely.  "Whaddya think, girls.  Be brutal, is it too gauche?"</p>

<p>"Lovely," Willow said, puzzled.  "So what?"</p>

<p>"So,"  Phoebe explained, "with an object that Buffy owns on my person all day, any time your
lives are threatened, I'll get one of my visions, and I'll call you.  Don't worry, Willow.  I've got
your home number, your office number at Willtronix, the number at Buffy's dojo, and both
your cell phones.  You're covered."</p>

<p>Buffy turned to Willow, and saw the trust in her green eyes.  Willow had known the
Halliwells for nearly eight years now, since she left Sunnydale to make a new life for herself in
San Francisco.  She wanted to forget what had happened, to forget Tara, to forget Buffy.
Prue, Piper and Phoebe were a comfort to her, but until she returned to Sunnydale for her
class reunion, and met Buffy again, she didn't feel whole.  Buffy was her center, her strength.</p>

<p>And Buffy looked upon Willow as her soul, her moral compass.  She knew that if Willow
trusted the Halliwell sisters, then they were worthy of trust.  "Okay," Buffy nodded to
Phoebe.  It's a plan."</p>

<p>"So, Leo," Piper turned toward her husband, a mischievous grin splitting her face, "did you
bring anything home from Anya's boutique for us?"  Leo rolled his eyes in mock
embarrassment, as the other girls enjoyed a stress-relieving laugh.</p>

<p align=center>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>

<p>Willow had finished her work on her home computer that night, as she prepared to call it a
night.  "Buffy," she called out.  "You coming to bed?"</p>

<p>"Just a sec, Wills," Buffy answered from the bathroom.  Having finished her evening
relaxation exersizes, she took a quick shower, cleaning off the sweat and grime of her day.
As she towelled herself dry, she glanced at the vanity, and noticed the tub of edible body
paint.  A wicked smile formed on her lips, as she considered the possibilities that this erotic
treat presented.  Willow came from a conservative background, and neither of them were
into kink, but occasional play was something they both appreciated.</p>

<p>She lifted the lid off the tub, and sniffed at its contents.  A rich chocolate aroma perked up
her nostrils, and she had to whiff some more.  She worked up her sexual appetite further
imagining the flavor of chocolate combined with the taste of Willow's skin, her breasts, her--
"Whoa, bad Buffy!" she said to herself, grinning even more broadly.  Oh, yes, the night was
going to be interesting.  She dipped her finger into the bucket, scooping out a dollup of the
thick liquid, preparing to taste.</p>

<p>A sudden breeze startled her with its chill, as the light switch turned off.  Buffy stood still in
the darkened bathroom, as she gingerly groped for the light switch.  The bathroom floor was
wet from her shower, and if she moved suddenly, she risked tripping and injury.  As she
sought the switch, she tried to remember when she left the window open, when it hit her; she
didn't.  Soon, she located the switch, and turned on the lights.</p>

<p>A message had been written on the vanity mirror, a finger wiping off the steam.  The message
was one word; "Don't".</p>

<p>"Uh, Willow?"  Buffy stammered toward the bedroom.  As she spoke, she heard a telephone
ring twice, before Willow answered it.  She waited warily by the vanity mirror, afraid to touch
anything, afraid to disturb the evidence of...what?  </p>

<p>Shortly Willow entered the bathroom.  Or rather, exploded into the bathroom.</p>

<p>"Buffy!" she screamed, "don't touch it!"</p>

<p>"I'm not, Willow," Buffy answered, confusion showing in her smoky blue eyes.</p>

<p>"No, no," Willow explained hastily, "don't touch the body paint!  You didn't taste it, did you?"</p>

<p>"No, not yet," Buffy absently remembered the dab of body paint on her finger.  "I was going
to try it out on you tonight, though--"</p>

<p>"It's poison," Willow blurted out.  "That was Phoebe on the line, she had a vision of you being
poisoned by the body paint!  Thank the Goddess I got to you in time--Buffy, what's that on
the mirror?"</p>

<p>Buffy remembered the strange message.  "I dunno, Wills.  Just before I could taste the stuff,
the lights went out for a sec, and when I turned them on, I saw this."  Willow looked at the
mirror, at the scrawled 'Don't', and calmly held out her hand near the mirror's surface.</p>

<p>"A ghost, maybe?" she ventured a guess.</p>

<p>"Seems like a possibility," Buffy answered, as she rinsed the paint off of her finger.  She
closed the tub, and said in a low voice, edged in dread, "but we've got a more pressing
problem.  The poisoned body paint means that Anya really is after us."</p>

<p>Willow's shoulders sagged at the realization.  "You're right, Buffy.  But why use poison, or try
to run us over?  And how could she have tricked Leo into believing that she was mortal?"</p>

<p>"A simple glamour, Witchipoo," an all-too familiar voice chimed around them.  "A simple
spell of illusion, fools even Whitelighters!"  A thunderclap shook the timbers of their house,
and Anyanka, vengeance demon, stood before them.  "Who's ready to party, girls?"</p>

<p>Buffy stepped between Anya and Willow, defiance in her posture, anger in her eyes.  "What
the hell do you want, Anya?  You've invaded our home, you've tried to kill us, you care to
explain your anti-social behavior?"</p>

<p>"No need to explain, Buff," Anya smiled sweetly as she blasted Buffy through the bathroom
door, and onto her back in the hallway.  She then turned her attentions to Willow.  "You
killed Xander, bitch!  You killed my orgasm partner!  You must pay for your crimes!  I will
have my vengeance!"</p>

<p>"Have your vengeance on me!" shouted another voice.  A small figure materialized before the
startled demoness.  "Willow didn't kill Xander, I did!  I created an effigy of him, a voodoo
doll, and stuck a pin in the effigy's heart!"  The ethereal form's features defined themselves
more fully, until Willow and Buffy were taken aback by the recognition of their ghostly visitor.</p>

<p>Tara's ghost stood before Anya, still small and weak, but gaining in strength with each word.
"I blamed Willow for what had happened to me, Demon.  You offered me vengeance against
the one who hurt me.  But you used me, enslaved me, so that the magic I controlled in life,
you would control.  But you don't have any more power over me.  Because I finally realize
that I've got nobody to blame for my death but myself!"  Anya shrunk back at Tara's words,
terror contorting her features.</p>

<p>"You--you killed my Xander?"  Anya shrieked at the ghost.  "I'll destroy you!"  She tried to
conjure a force, a weapon, anything to rid her of the ghost, but Willow pushed her back with
a conjured gust of wind.  "NO!  No more!  You'll hurt no one!"  She pinned Anya down
telekenetically, saying, "I lived in fear because of you.  You made me think my love was fatal,
that my loving Buffy would kill her.  No more.  You don't have the power to make me
unhappy anymore.  You're nothing, less than nothing!"</p>

<p>Just then, a shrieking car brake could be heard outside.  Frantic knocking at the door alerted
Buffy, who opened the door, permitting the Halliwell sisters to enter.  Without preamble,
Prue started to chant; "The Power of Three will set us free."  Piper repeated the chant, and
Phoebe joined in on the third round.  Anya stood powerless before the wills of the three
witches who surrounded her.  The sisters then recited the spell from the Book of Shadows;</p>

<p>Hear now the words of the Witches Three,<br>
As thrice times round our charm binds thee.<br>
The one you would kill is not at fault,<br>
Let your hatred cease and your anger halt.<br>
Begone to the realm from whence you came,<br>
And harm not the one who is not to blame.</p>

<p>Anya screamed as arcane energies engulfed her, suffused her, consumed her.  Within
seconds, her corporeal form was no more.  The demon Anyanka had been vanquished.</p>

<p>Four witches and a retired Slayer drew a collective sigh of relief.  "Well, that was fun,"
Phoebe broke the silence cheerily, "who's for Mongolian barbeque?"</p>

<p>Willow and Buffy didn't hear Phoebe's quip, their attention was riveted to the spectre
standing before them.  Tara's ghost now stood as tall as she was in life, but infinitely sadder.
Her face was one who had borne all of her sins, willingly, if not gladly.  She had killed, she
had harmed others, she had taken a coward's way out by taking her own life, and now she
repented.</p>

<p>"Tara," Buffy whispered.  "It was you, wasn't it?  You stopped me from trying the body paint.
You wrote on the mirror."</p>

<p>"Yes," the ghost answered.  "I had hurt Willow enough in my life, I could not let her be hurt
for my actions now."  She turned to Willow, saying, "I can't expect you to forgive me my
crimes, Willow.  But please, I beg you, by the love I felt for you then and feel for you now,
don't blame yourself.  Forgive yourself."</p>

<p>Willow nodded at the apparition.  "I do.  Both myself, and you."  She held up her arms to hug
her, then awkwardly remembered, "Oh, right, ghost.  Sorry."</p>

<p>"You could stand to take your own advice," Leo said, materializing next to Piper.  Another
form stood next to Leo, and Willow nearly fainted in Buffy's arms.  "Xander!" she shouted.</p>

<p>Her childhood friend smiled at her.  "In the newly formed flesh, Willow."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled lopsidedly at Xander, saying, "Hey, Xand, great to see you, and don't take this
the wrong way, I'm glad, don't get me wrong, to see you again, but--"</p>

<p>"I'm dead, right?" Xander gave his famous "Xander smile".  </p>

<p>"Uh, yeah," Willow said for her fiancee.  "No offense."</p>

<p>"Hey, I know what you mean.  But I was dead.  For a little while anyway.  Leo's superiors
found my soul after I died, and, well, do the math."</p>

<p>Prue pointed at Xander, the shock of epiphony hitting her.  "You were reborn as a
Whitelighter." she said, not an accusation but a simple statement of fact.</p>

<p>"Give the girl a Kewpie doll!" Xander quipped.  "To be specific," he added, turning to
Willow, "I'm your Whitelighter.  When I first became a Whitelighter, I requested this
assignment.  To make up for being such a, well, a--"</p>

<p>"The southern end of a northbound horse?" Buffy suggested.  Willow glared at her.  Phoebe
chuckled; she was going to have to save that one.</p>

<p>"Exactly," Xander admitted.  "I guess I needed to watch my friend, and make sure she's
okay.  Willow, I'm sorry for the way I treated you.  I didn't trust Tara, but I shouldn't take it
out on you.  Still friends?"</p>

<p>"Like you need to ask, you knuckleknob?"  Willow embraced her longtime friend, and Buffy
wrapped her arms around them both.  After a few seconds, Xander quipped, "Uh, guys,
oxygen becoming an issue!"</p>

<p>"And as for you, Tara," Leo said, approaching the ghost.  "You've proven your readiness to
atone for your misdeeds.  If you wish, I can arrange for you to finish your penance."  He
smiled at the sad apparition, saying, "You'd make a fine Whitelighter."  Tara smiled at Leo,
nodding her assent.</p>

<p>For Tara, Xander and Willow, the time of recriminations was at an end.  And for all three of
them, their new lives began that evening.</p>

<p align=center>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>

<p align=center>Sometimes it seems<br>
We'll touch that dream,<br>
But things come slow or not at all.<br>
And the ones on top,<br>
Won't make it stop,<br>
So convinced that they might fall.<br>
Let's love ourselves  and we can't fail<br>
To make a better situation;<br>
Tomorrow, our seeds will grow,<br>
All we need is dedication.</p>

<p align=center>Everything is everything.<br>
What is meant to be will be.<br>
After winter must come spring,<br>
Change will come eventually.</p>

<p>Lauryn Hill finished up her show on the P3's stage, as the bachelorette party continued.
Buffy and Willow were both suitably embarrassed by the various revealing lingerie they
received from the Halliwells and Cordy, but both secretly harbored fantasies of seeing each
other wearing them, followed by their not wearing them.</p>

<p>"Hey, Cordy, how's the first Hope episode of 'Steffi the Demon Killer' coming along?" Buffy
asked, the wine going slightly to her head.</p>

<p>"Famously," Cordy answered.  "And we may have finally convinced the suits to cave
regarding the Steffi/Laurel subplot."</p>

<p>"Ooh, does this mean we'll see Cordy kissing a girl?" Phoebe teased the actress.</p>

<p>"I can give you some pointers," Buffy offered, only to have Willow playfully elbow her in the
ribs.  "Oh no you don't!"</p>

<p>Leo and Xander strolled up to the girls as the party was winding down.  "Hey ladies," Leo
greeted them.  "Mind if I steal my wife for dancing purposes?"</p>

<p>"Dancing porpoises?" Phoebe giggled drunkenly as Piper took her husband's hand and
allowed him to lead her to the dance floor.  "Sounds like something you'd find at SeaWorld!"</p>

<p>"My kind of woman," Xander grinned.  "Care for a dance, Pheebs?"</p>

<p>"Why, sir," she said in her best Southern drawl, "I'd be delighted."  As Xander escorted
Phoebe closer to the stage, Prue watched her sisters as they danced.  Buffy, Willow and
Cordy looked on wistfully.</p>

<p>"Where can I get a Whitelighter?" Cordy asked in a stage whisper.</p>

<p>"Forget it, Cordy," Prue growled.  "The next one's mine."  This brought a new wave of
giggles among the ladies at the table.  Buffy then stood up and asked Willow, "May I have
this dance?"</p>

<p>"You may have every dance," Willow curtseyed to her beloved, as they headed for the dance
floor.  As they moved their bodies closer together to the thobbing rhythms, Willow's heart felt
light.  Within the last week, she had made her peace with Tara, and had renewed a friendship
she feared lost forever.  And in two weeks, she and Buffy would be married.</p>

<p>She had lain the ghosts of her past to rest, and now revelled in the prospect of her future.
And as she lost herself in the circle of Buffy's arms, the light of her eyes and the heat of her
body, she knew that Buffy was her future.</p>
