<!-- Sappho's Scroll \ Epiogue 2 -->

<p>Sunnydale, California, October 1999</p>

<p>Buffy was exercising when Willow came
into their shared dorm room. She had music playing,
full blare, and it was all Willow could
do to keep from walking back out. "Hey!" She called
out, over the blaring of the CD player.
"Can I turn this down?"</p>

<p>Buffy, finally noticing Willow standing
there, nodded her head as she continued her fighting
moves. Willow noticed a package wrapped
in brown paper on her bed and walked over to
it. "Hey, what's this?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"Don't know." Buffy grunted. "It came
for you today." Sweat was pouring off of the Slayer's
face and Willow tried not to notice
how beautiful she was. Buffy wiped her face with the
towel she kept handy for just an occasion,
and went to sit on her bed. "Are you going to
open it, or just look at it for the
rest of the night?" Buffy asked, impatient to see what it was.
Her curiosity had been eating at her
all through her work out, and now she couldn't wait for
Willow to tear into the package.</p>

<p>Willow spared her best friend an appraising
look, then smirked at her. "Dying of curiosity,
aren't you?" She asked. She knew her
friend so well.</p>

<p>"Will! Would you just open it?!" Buffy
asked, exasperated. Though her excited smile took the
sting out of her words.</p>

<p>Willow chuckled, then opened the package,
finding a dusty old tome inside. "Oh!" Willow
gasped, excited. "It's the spell book
my friend said he was going to send me." Willow
couldn't wait to start shuffling through
the pages, looking for interesting spells that she wanted
to try.</p>

<p>"That's great, Will." Buffy said, smiling.
Now that her curiosity was sated she could get back
to her exercising. "Have fun." She
murmured, knowing Willow probably wouldn't poke her
head out of the book for a couple of
hours at least.</p>

<p>"Uh huh." Willow muttered, already lost
in reading the spells in the book. Buffy went over the
closet door and started doing chin-ups
on the frame. 'She gets so excited over those spells.'
Buffy thought, shaking her head and
chuckling.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Willow was turning the pages
of the book, reading the names of the spells on
each one when one of them caught her
eye. It was titled, 'True Love's Touch.' and the witch
that had written the spell had signed
her name underneath the title along with a dedication.
'Sappho', Willow thought to herself.
'Now there's an unusual name.' She vaguely
remembered a lesson in a history class
she had taken about a poet in Ancient Greece with the
name of Sappho, but she didn't remember
all that had been said about her. She had been
paying too much attention to Xander
and Buffy, who had been goofing off that day because
they were bored. But it struck her
odd that a witch had the same name of the ancient poet,
and it filled her with curiosity to
see what the spell was about. But first she read the
Dedication. Twice.</p>

<p><i>~To the Warrior and follower, may your
threads never be cut.</i></p>

<p>Willow thought the Dedication was rather
odd, and she didn't know what it meant, but it
struck her curiosity, so she decided
to read the spell to see if she could decipher the meaning
behind the words. By the time she finished
the page the spell was cast.</p>
