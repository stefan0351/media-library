<!-- The Dying of the Light \ Chapter 7: Class Protector -->

<p>"Elizabeth Anne Summers," Belial, the demon who wore the shape of former
high school
principal Roland Snyder hissed through gleaming teeth as he tossed Buffy
body around like a
rag doll, "you don't know how much pleasure I'm deriving from this
moment!" Buffy
managed to roll as she landed to minimize any injury, but the force of the
impact with the
ground still knocked some of the wind out of her. "I thought that
merely expelling you was
the height of bliss for me, but actually killing you, oh, that's the
ultimate rush!"</p>

<p>Xander threw himself at the demon Belial, desperately trying to stop his
assault on Buffy, only
to be shrugged off like a spit wad. "Pathetic as always, Xander,"
Belial responded to the
attack. "Don't be impatient, I'll get around to killing you soon
enough!" </p>

<p>As Xander fell back, Spike took his turn. Sword in hand, he
approached the demon almost
casually, saying in a conversational voice, "'Ere now, gov, that's no way
to act. If you're
gonna take over this mudball, you're going to have to get along with the
local-UNGHH!"</p>

<p>"You shame your kind, whelp," Belial hissed, as he cracked Spike's skull
with one blow,
knocking the vampire unconscious. "Hanging around with the
cattle! That's all they are, do
you hear? Cattle!" He returned his attention to Buffy, who had
managed to stand up and
dodge his next blow. She was getting stronger, in part the result of
the anti-toxin Willow had
given her and in part the result of her confession of love for her.
But Belial was a tough one,
maybe even stronger than what Mayor Wilkins became after his
Ascension. She didn't know
if she could hold out long against him.</p>

<p>"I remember concerning with your mother, when I tried to enforce your
expulsion," the
demon continued, "and her pitiful efforts to have you reinstated. She
asked me how I could
be so caviler about your future." Buffy tried to duck his
outstretched arm, but he proved too
fast for her. He grabbed her by the hair, pulling her face up toward
his. "Your future! Don't
you see? My sole purpose in being on your miserable dirt ball of a
planet is to insure that you
and your entire species didn't have a future! That fool Wilkins
thought that he could eliminate
me, but I showed him! This world is mine! MINE!" He
laughed gleefully, assured that no
one could stop his conquest. </p>

<p>As she struggled to release herself from Belial's grip, Buffy was
peripherally aware of Giles
firing several bolts from his crossbow with point-blank accuracy, only to
watch them bounce
off the monster's hide. She noticed Willow about to fire another
crossbow at Belial, only to
watch as the fiend raised his left fist and landed it on Willow with the
force of a club. </p>

<p>Buffy screamed as she watched her newly discovered love fall, and managed
to twist her
body upwards to connect a high scissor kick to Belial's jaw. The
demon was sent reeling,
briefly loosening his grip on Buffy's hair, but with enough time for Buffy
to gain her freedom.
She immediately ran to Willow's side, calling out to her; "C'mon, Willow,
don't die on me, not
now!" Instinctively she checked for a pulse and breathing and was
relieved to find both.
"Will? Are you okay? How you feeling?"</p>

<p>Willow choked and wheezed as she tried to regain her composure. She
looked at Buffy and
said, gasping, "I--feel as though--a very large demon--used me for a
punching bag. Other
than that, not too many complaints. I think that the last of my
herbal spell cushioned the
blow, but my shields are down. I don't think I can take another blow
like that."</p>

<p>"Don't try, love," Buffy murmured as she took her Willow into her
arms. "I'm not going to
lose you now that I found you." She kissed her on the forehead, and
turned toward the
battlefield. Belial had been suddenly occupied by the forces of the
Initiative, who had
concentrated their firepower on the demon. Electro-rifles and other
energy discharging
weapons fired heavily at Belial, but if they had any effect on him, he
didn't show it.</p>

<p>"Pour it on, men!" Riley shouted. "Everything you got! Fry that
bastard!" Bolts of electricity,
gouts of flame, beams of concentrated photons, all converged on their
target. With each
passing second, the demon Belial slowly shed his human guise, resembling
his true form, or as
close to his true nature as mere mortals can fathom. Willow thought
he resembled the demon
from the "Night On Bald Mountain" sequence from Disney's "Fantasia".
Buffy recalled the
Tim Curry character from "Legend", while Xander saw it as an anime
monster.</p>

<p>As the fiend transformed, however, he laughed. His unearthly laughter
rolled across the
battlefield like the thunder of doom. "You can't stop me," he
shouted, mocking the soldiers.
"I'm eternal! I am the author of all misery! I will foul this
planet with my seed! I will sear the
mountains, I will boil the oceans, I will..."</p>

<p>"YOU WILL SHUT YOUR STINKING PIE-HOLE!" A swift flying kick to the
jaw caught
Belial off guard, as Alt-Buffy pressed her attack against the demon.
The monster who
destroyed her world wasn't going to get his chance, not if she had anything
to say about it.
She kicked, gouged, bit, clawed, attacked with feral savagery. "I've
spent the last years of
my life fighting scum like you!" Foot to the ribs. "You think you're
so damn hot?" Fist to the
jaw. "You're just another demon with delusions of grandeur!" Heel to
the groin. "And I'm
just the girl to send you back to Hell!" She delivered another
scissor kick, directly to his
hideous head.</p>

<p>Belial grabbed her ankle in mid-flight, and her inertia tossed her flat on
her back. "Fool," he
grinned at Buffy. "A hundred Slayers cannot stop me now. Get
the message yet, Summers?
Invincible. Look it up." He stamped his cloven hoof down hard
on Alt-Buffy's torso,
severing her spine. "I'd like to stay and chat, Summers, but I have a
world to destroy.
Sorry, I'm swamped." He turned away from the fallen slayer, and rose
his muscular arms, the
contract clutched tightly in his right hand. With his gesture, a maw
opened in mid-air. The
flaw in space widened further, casting a baleful light over the
field. The two Buffies, Giles,
Xander, Anya and Willow all knew what the maw was; the Hellmouth was
opening, at
Belial's command. And soon, all that was foul would rush forth onto
the world.</p>

<p>Riley rushed to the fallen Buffy, joined by her younger counterpart.
"My god," he murmured
as he looked at the wounded slayer's face, and then back at younger
Buffy. "How...how..."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you later," Buffy answered as she tended to Alt-Buffy's slashed
face. "Assuming one,
that there is a later, and two, that we're still on speaking terms,
considering that I've just
dumped you for Willow."</p>

<p>"I'm still your friend, if you'll have me," Riley answered, as he examined
Alt-Buffy. "Oh, God,
Belial did a number on you," he said to the older Buffy, as he took in her
injuries. "I'm afraid
you're looking at permanent paralysis, friend. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Hey," Alt-Buffy half-smiled at Riley. "Right now, that's the least of my
problems. How do
we stop Belial?"</p>

<p>"It's the contract," Giles, who had emerged from his cover behind the
bleachers and gathered
around the two Slayers. "That's the key; 'As long as the contract is
in my hand', that's what
Belial said! The contract is the conduit by which he's opening
the Hellmouth!"</p>

<p>"So we destroy the contract, and then--" Buffy started, looking at
Alt-Buffy.</p>

<p>Alt-Buffy took the young slayer's hand in her own, and coughing, said, "Do
it."</p>

<p>Buffy nodded at her other self, then said, cold determination in her
voice; "Giles, take care of
her, keep her as comfortable as you can. Riley? Do you have a
spare flame-thrower?"</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Be patient, my brethren," Belial cried out to whatever unholy beings
lurked on the other side
of the opening Hellmouth, "our time of waiting is nigh at an end!
Soon the world that once
was ours will be ours again!" So absorbed with what he was doing was
he that he didn't
notice four lone figures planning against him. Suddenly, a blast from
a flame-thrower seared
the demon's back. He shrieked in brief pain and turned to the
direction of the blast.
"Summers?"</p>

<p>"Hey, Your Ugliness!" Buffy taunted the monster, waving her flame-thrower
around like a
sword, and shouting trash. "I'm the one you want, right? You
want a piece of me? Here I
am, Snydely Whiplash! C'mon, Creepo! Isn't this what you
wanted? You and me, the big
throwdown?"</p>

<p>"You're that impatient to die?" Belial howled. "I shall rend your
flesh, I will use your skin for
a drumhead, your bones as my mallets as I shout my victory
march!"</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah, I'm so shaking, your Skankyness!" She beckoned with her
hands. "C'mon!
You talk the talk, can you walk the walk? Hit me with your best
shot!"</p>

<p>"You will suffer as none before you," Belial promised. He advanced
toward Buffy, not
noticing Riley sneaking around behind him. Suddenly, Riley made his
move; he grabbed
Belial's right wrist, and with adrenalin-fueled strength, managed to loosen
his grip on the
contract and snatch it from his hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly aware that he had lost the contract, Belial turned his
concentration from Buffy
toward Riley, who was running from him fast and furious. "Give me the
contract, you fool!"
he bellowed in rage, lunging at Riley, grabbing his legs.</p>

<p>As he fell, he held out the contract, calling out, "Xander!
Catch!" Xander immediately
grabbed the contract from Riley, and ran off in a zig-zag
pattern.</p>

<p>"Harris receives from Finn and is charging down the field," he shouted as
he crumpled the
contract into a ball, "looking for a long bomb!"</p>

<p>"Xander!" Willow shouted, waving her arms frantically. "I'm
open!"</p>

<p>"Harris throws a bullet to Rosenburg!" he shouted as he tossed the crumpled
contract to
Willow. </p>

<p>Willow ran toward Buffy, crying out, "Rosenburg takes it to the offensive
glass and slams it in
for two points!" </p>

<p>As she took the contract from Willow, Buffy said, "That's basketball!
Xander was going for
football metaphors!"</p>

<p>"So I don't know sports!" Willow shouted. "What do you want me to
do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll think of something later tonight!" Buffy promised, her
smile turning into a leer. She
strode toward Belial, who was still wrestling with Riley. "Yo,
Snyder!" she called out,
displaying the contract, which she had un-crumpled for display
purposes. "Looking for this?"</p>

<p>Belial turned toward Buffy, letting go of Riley. Riley fell to the
ground in an inglorious heap.
"Give me that contract, girl!" Belial screamed as he stalked toward
Buffy.</p>

<p>Buffy simply stood her ground, directly opposite of the wound in the sky
behind Belial. She
held the contract in one hand, the flame-thrower in the other.
</p>

<p>"Snyder!" she called out, grinning from ear to ear, then waited a
beat. "You're expelled!"</p>

<p>She tossed the contract into the air, and as it started to drift lazily to
the ground, she pointed
the flame-thrower at the parchment and fired. The document was ash
before it hit the
ground.</p>

<p>Belial screamed in agony, as the aperture to Hell started to
contract. A violent gust of some
unholy wind blasted the battlefield, and Buffy and the others braced
themselves for the blast.
Belial however was pulled toward the vortex by the unearthly gusts.
Frantically he clawed
the ground with his hands, desperate to fight the pull, but the vortex
would not be denied its
catch. Within seconds, Belial lost his grip on the sod and was
thrown, spiraling, tumbling,
into the portal, which suddenly snapped shut behind him, like the iris
aperture on a camera. </p>

<p>The wind and the light show ceased. A profound silence remained, as
all those assembled
processed what they saw. The calm after the storm was then shattered
by the riotous
cheering of the Initiative troops. Buffy and Willow led the rest of
the Scooby Gang to where
Alt-Buffy was lying. Giles, who had been looking after the brave
young woman, turned
toward Buffy and said to her, "It doesn't look good, I'm afraid. Too
many internal injuries."</p>

<p>"Hey, Buff?" the injured Slayer coughed, trying to smile. "You--did
it--"</p>

<p>"We did it," Buffy smiled back, holding her hand firmly. "You gave us
the time to come up
with the plan. You saved us all."</p>

<p>"Yeah," she groaned, smiling through her agony. "But there's
still(ugh)--still one thing--I have
to do. Behind the bleachers--" Buffy nodded, and ran to where
she indicated. She fetched
the tattered old duffel bag, and returned quickly to the fallen
Slayer.</p>

<p>Willow had cradled Alt-Buffy's head as she had done with her Buffy not long
before, as Giles
was trying to steady her, saying, "Please, Buffy, try to hold still, or it
will only hurt more..."</p>

<p>"No, Giles," she stopped him. "You don't understand. I need the
staff--to finish--the spell--
I'm not supposed to exist anymore--"</p>

<p>"No, Buffy!" Willow wailed. "You can't die, not now!"</p>

<p>"But it's not--not death, Wills," Alt-Buffy answered her dearest friend,
lifting her hand with
great effort to stroke her cheek. "The Buffy you love--is right
here. She's not going
anywhere." Alt-Buffy took Willow's hand, and placed it in Buffy's,
who reached around
Willow with her other arm, holding her closely. "Please.
Promise me--that you'll love each
other."</p>

<p>"We will," they said in unison, and looked at each other as the words were
spoken. For all
intents and purposes, they realized, they had made a lifetime commitment of
love and trust, as
binding as a wedding vow. A commitment they both knew they would
honor for the rest of
their lives together.</p>

<p>No more words were said, as Buffy handed her time-lost other self the Staff
of Hermes. The
brass rod glistened in the dim streetlights around them, and then seemed to
come alive in Alt-
Buffy's hand, with an incandescence of its own.</p>

<p>Alt-Buffy held the staff aloft, closed her eyes one last time, and said in
as clear a voice as she
could muster, "Mutatis Mutandis." Her arm gave out its last iota of
strength, as she slumped
in Willow's arms. Her body then seemed to shimmer, to ripple, to
fade, until only the
memory of those whom she had met remained to testify that she
existed.</p>

<p>Willow wept openly now, her face buried in Buffy's shoulder, as Buffy
stroked her lover's red
hair and whispered assurances to her. Her unconditional love for
Willow kept the girl from
crashing, from falling into the abyss. Watching the time traveler
simply accept her fate and
fade from reality was closer to seeing Buffy Summers die than she ever
wanted to get.</p>

<p>Xander coughed an 'ahem' to get their attention. "I hate to break
this little lover's moment up,
girls," he said quietly, "which, incidentally, I'm entirely cool with, in
case you were
wondering," Anya nodded in silent agreement with her boyfriend. "But
what happened to
Spike?"</p>

<p>They turned around, and Buffy nodded, "He's headed out, toward Wetherly
Park. Let him
go, Xander. He's still got that chip. He won't be putting the
bite on anyone tonight." Her
lame pun got a smile out of Willow, a smile which melted Buffy's heart like
ice-cream on a
hot day.</p>

<p>"Giles," she turned to her mentor and asked, "Just what did Alt-me say just
before--" she
couldn't finish.</p>

<p>" 'Mutatis Mutandis'," Giles explained somberly. "Old Greek.
Meaning, 'The necessary
changes have been made'." The others nodded</p>

<p>Riley Finn watched these events unfold, realizing two things; First, that
there were truly some
events that modern science could not begin to explain; and Second, that
Buffy Summers and
Willow Rosenburg were as much in love as any two people that he had ever
known. And
whatever he had hoped for in his relationship with Buffy, he had neither
the right nor the
desire to interfere. Buffy looked at Riley as he started to walk
away, taking his men away
from the field, and felt sympathy for him. She offered a silent
prayer to any god in the
vicinity, that Riley would find someone who could make him as happy as
Willow Rosenburg
made her.</p>

<p>Another thought took hold of Buffy at that point. "I don't know about
the rest of you, but I'm
hungry enough to eat a sled dog team!"</p>

<p>"Omigod," Willow exclaimed, "the antitoxin. Giles said that it would
cause you to become
hungry!" She turned to the Watcher with a sinister grin, adding, "He
also said something
about springing for a post-world-saveage pizza party."</p>

<p>"I did, didn't I?" Giles laughed at the young wiccan. "I'd be
delighted." Giles' announcement
was greeted with cheers from all concerned. "So long as nobody orders
anchovies!" he
amended.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>The pizza party was the social event of the season, Scooby-Gang-wise.
A karaoke system
was available at the pizzeria, and the gang were pleased to monopolize its
use. Anya started
things rolling, with a rousing chorus of the DiVinyl's "I Touch Myself",
amid catcalls from
several other tables. </p>

<p>Xander requested Don McLean's "American Pie" but true to form, sang the
"Weird Al"
Yankovic lyrics. Buffy, Willow and Anya gleefully sang along with the
second chorus;</p>

<p>"My, my, this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry,
And he left his home, kissed his mommy goodbye,
Saying, Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi,
Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi!"</p>

<p>Even the normally reserved Giles got into the act, belting out a
surprisingly decent version of
David Bowie's "Heroes", followed by "Take Me To The Pilot" by Elton
John. On the second
track, Buffy and Willow got on stage with Giles, dancing close together and
singing backup
vocals. Willow then took the stage, saying, "Okay guys, this is a
John Hiatt song. Jewel sang
it in the soundtrack for 'Phenomenon', that John Travolta thing. Here
we go. This one's for
you, Buffy." Buffy smiled beatifically at the mention. The
music started, Willow waited for
her cue, and sang;</p>

<center>
<p>"When the road gets dark,<br>
You can no longer see,<br>
Let my love throw out a spark, baby,<br>
Have A Little Faith In Me.</p>

<p>When the tears you cry,<br>
You can no longer believe,<br>
Give these loving arms a try,<br>
Have A Little Faith In Me.</p>

<p>Have A Little Faith In Me,<br>
Have A Little Faith In Me.<br>
Have A Little Faith In Me,<br>
Have A Little Faith In Me.</p>

<p>When your secret heart<br>
Cannot speak so easily,<br>
Come here darling, whisper a start,<br>
Have A Little Faith In Me.</p>

<p>When your back's against the wall,<br>
Turn around, you will see,<br>
I will catch your when you fall,<br>
Have A Little Faith In Me.</p>

<p>Have A Little Faith In Me,<br>
Have A Little Faith In Me.<br>
Have A Little Faith In Me,<br>
Have A Little Faith In Me.</p>

<p>I've been loving you for such a long time, darling,<br>
I expect nothing in the world but for you to have a little faith in
me.<br>
You see time is our friend, for you and me there is no end,<br>
All you gotta do is Have A Little Faith In Me!"</p>
</center>

<p>She sang with full throat and diaphragm, and from the heart. Any
doubt that Buffy had
concerning the emotions they shared was eliminated by her heartfelt
display. At the close of
the song, Willow bowed deeply, smiling broadly. Buffy met her at the
stage, and hugged her
close, kissing her cheek. "I love you, Wills," she whispered into her
ear.</p>

<p>"I love you back, Buffy," Willow answered.</p>

<p>"Y'know," Xander quipped, his mouth full of Canadian bacon and pineapple
pizza, "It seems
to me that we've heard from everyone at this party, except a certain
Vampire Slayer we all
know and love," he leered at Willow, "some more than others." Willow
threw a straw at
Xander, as Anya chuckled.</p>

<p>"Yeah, Buffy, let's see you humiliate yourself in this cultural display of
vanity," Anya purred.</p>

<p>"Oh no," Buffy protested. "You don't want to hear me sing, really."
But her protests were
drowned out by Xander and Anya chanting, "Buffy, Buffy, Buffy!" She
turned to Giles for
support, but he merely shrugged, "I'm sorry Buffy, but you're on your
own."</p>

<p>"Please, Buffy?" Willow entreated, giving a deadly combination of her
Resolve face and Big
Puppy Dog Eyes face. Buffy looked at her amazed.</p>

<p>"You play dirty, you know that, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Wait until I get you alone, Slayer," Willow grinned, winking. Anya
whooped with glee at
Willow's efforts at seduction. </p>

<p>Buffy threw her hands up, saying, "Okay, okay, before this conversation
gets aired on late
night Cinemax, I'll do it!" The Scoobs applauded as Buffy looked at
the play list. Selecting a
song she thought appropriate, she took the stage, announcing, "This one's
for you, Willow. A
little Natalie Merchant. You have been warned." The song
started, and Buffy sang out a
surprisingly clear string of 'la-la-las' leading up to the song;</p>

<center>
<p>"You've been so Kind and Generous,<br>
I don't know how you keep on giving,<br>
For your kindness,<br>
I'm in debt to you.<br>
For your selflessness, my admiration,<br>
For everything you've done, you know I'm bound,<br>
I'm bound to thank you for it,</p>
</center>

<p>La-la-la, la la la la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la la la la---</p>

<center>
<p>You've been so Kind and Generous,<br>
I don't know how you keep on giving,<br>
For your kindness,<br>
I'm in debt to you.<br>
And I never could have gone this far without you,<br>
For everything you've done, you know I'm bound,<br>
I'm bound to thank you for it!</p>
</center>

<p>La-la-la, la la la la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la la la la---</p>

<p>I want to thank you for the many gifts you gave,<br>
For the love and tenderness, I want to thank you.<br>
I want to thank you for your generosity,<br>
For the love and the honesty that you gave me.<br>
I want to thank you, show my gratitude,<br>
My love and my respect for you, I want to thank you,<br>
I want to thank you, thank you,<br>
Thank you, thank you,<br>
Thank you, thank you,<br>
Thank you, thank you..."</p>

<p>The song ended, friends cheered, and the party went on for several hours
after. When the
party wound down, the two girls went back to their dorm to finish packing
for winter break,
a task they started just that afternoon, a lifetime ago.</p>

<p>Buffy took Willow in her arms again, and kissed her soundly. Willow
reciprocated, and their
mouths and tongues sought to taste, to feel each other.
Breaking away reluctantly from the
kiss, Buffy smiled to the love of her life, saying, "You know, I never
quite felt like this before."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you say that to all the girls," Willow said, trying to sound
sultry. Buffy had to admit
she was getting close.</p>

<p>"No, Wills, really," she tried to explain her thoughts, despite the
distraction of Willow's
blowing on her ear. "It's like I finally know what my life is all
about. Sure, I'm the Slayer, the
one girl who can stand against the vampires, the demons, yadda yadda, but
now there
something more. Being here with you, holding, touching, kissing..."
she couldn't resist taking
another sip from Willow's lips before continuing, "it's like I'm
renewed. Like this is what it's
all about. The reason I keep fighting the nasties. Why I keep
saving the world. Because
you're a part of that world. You're my world, Willow. I don't
know how to explain it any
better than that."</p>

<p>"I understand, Buffy," Willow answered, moved by Buffy's confession.
"It's like Oz, Xander,
anyone I thought I was in love with before, that was all just a rehearsal
for loving you. I do
love you so much, Buffy." She kissed her again, and this time, the
kiss grew in tempo and in
heat. Willow's hands felt around Buffy's back, reaching under her
tee-shirt, slowly tugging at
it. Buffy backed away just enough for Willow to slip the shirt off,
revealing a black sports
bra. Buffy started to unbutton Willow's shirt, and within two
minutes, their passion began in
earnest.</p>

<p>For the rest of the night, two lovers explored each other's bodies,
memorizing every curve,
every nuance, every sensation they could elicit from each other.
After their initial frantic
lovemaking, and the first fiery orgasms, they still cuddled, still touched,
still groped, until the
erotic cycle started again, and again for hours. </p>

<p>They were fully aware that the real world would crash in on them later on,
and there would
be challenges to face in the cold light of day. There was still the
Initiative to deal with.
Despite their assistance in the final battle with Belial, Buffy still
didn't know what to make of
them. There was the problem of how others on campus would take their
newly defined
relationship, once it became public knowledge("And it will" teased Buffy,
"because you're
such a screamer!"). And there was the constant parade of demons,
vampires and assorted
monsters to deal with on a nightly basis.</p>

<p>But for this one night, none of that mattered. There were only two
young women, who had
been burnt by first loves before, only to find in each other the love that
they had been
searching for all along.</p>

<p>And for one beautiful night, there wasn't a thing wrong in Sunnydale,
California.<BR><BR></p>

<p>Epilogue; An Angel's Blessing.</p>

<p>Los Angeles, New Year's Eve, 1999;</p>

<p>"Hey, Boss," Cordelia Chase greeted the youthful looking man who walked
into the office
that night. "How's life--uh, so to speak."</p>

<p>"Fine, Cordy," Angel answered. "Any plans for tonight?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not really," Cordelia answered. "Just me and a bottle of cheap
champagne, waiting for
the computer to crash. Oh, speaking of which, I got an e-mail from
Willow."</p>

<p>"Hey, that's good," Angel perked up. "How's our favorite
hacker?"</p>

<p>"Still hacking," Cordy started. "Uh, you may want to sit down for
this," she added nervously.</p>

<p>"What's the what, Cordy?"</p>

<p>"Well," she started, "Willow's found someone new."</p>

<p>"That's all?" Angel asked, puzzled. "I knew about her and Oz
splitting, but if she's found
someone else, isn't that good news?"</p>

<p>"Uh, it's who that someone else is that's problematic," Cordy
started.</p>

<p>Angel looked directly into her eyes, and asked, "Is it Buffy?"</p>

<p>Cordelia sat slack-jawed at the vampire's observation. "How-how
did--"</p>

<p>"Hey, I've been around for more than a few years," Angel smiled. "A
couple hundred years
of people-watching, you pick up a few things. Buffy and Willow have
always had this
connection, I've been aware of it from day one. That's why Angelus
kept threatening Willow
when he was out to get back at Buffy. He knew that Buffy would die
before letting anything
happen to Willow."</p>

<p>"And this doesn't bother you?" Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>"Not at all," Angel replied. "I knew that Buffy and I had no future,
that's why I left, to give
her the chance to find someone who could give her what I couldn't. If
she has, I'm happy for
her." Grabbing his duster jacket, he announced, "Come on, Cordy, I am
taking you dancing.
We'll celebrate Buffy and Willow's happiness, and ring in the new year
right."</p>

<p>"What the hell," Cordy answered. "Can we swing by my apartment first,
so I can find a
dress?"</p>

<p>"Sure," Angel quipped, "Then we'll have just enough time to ring in the
year 2001."</p>

<p>"Hey!" Cordy complained as they left his office, "That's why I left
Xander..."</p>
