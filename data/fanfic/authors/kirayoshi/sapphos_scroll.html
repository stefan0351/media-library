<p>Gabrielle was rather pleased with herself
that sunny afternoon. Xena had sent her to a
nearby town for provisions, and her
famed skill for haggling had served her in good stead.
Not only had she managed to get everything
on the list that Xena had given her for the dinars
she had been provided, but she had
enough left over for a few extra sheets of parchment, a
fine goose-feather pen nib, and three
fresh-baked loaves of nutbread.</p>

<p>The strawberry-blond bard carried her
parcel on her back, balanced her staff in her hand,
and began to compose a humorous ballad
regarding her recent market experiences. " 'I sing
of the mistress of negotiation--' nah,
'Of arms and the budget I sing--' no way!" Gabrielle
giggled at her imagination. It
had been a slow couple of weeks for Xena and herself; no evil
warlords rattling their sabers, no
disasters sent by the gods to bedevil a village whose only
crime was to mispronounce Aphrodite's
name, no threats from Ares, no complex plans of
Autolycus to disrupt, not even any
interruptions by Joxer. A quiet respite from the rigors of
heroism. Gabrielle smiled.
She needed the rest. And gods know, so did Xena.</p>

<p>She thought back to this strange and
wonderful woman whom she called her friend. Her
raven-dark hair, her piercing blue
eyes, her strong, supple body, her full lush lips that so
rarely smiled, but when they did, it
warmed the bard's heart to its core. She couldn't imagine
how she could have continued with the
mundane existence she had known in Potedia, before
she met this strong, confident, yet
at the same time troubled, woman. She had seen her at her
best, and at her worst. They
had saved each others' lives countless times(although Xena was
ahead of Gabrielle, the bard thought
ruefully), enjoyed each others' company, gotten on each
other's nerves, even tried to kill
each other one terrible day, but through all the hardships,
they had found their way back to each
other, time and again.</p>

<p>She didn't know just when it happened,
when her abiding friendship for the beautiful warrior
grew into a passionate love, but it
did. She once tried to run away from that love, going so
far as to marry Perdicus, even though
she knew that she didn't love him as he loved her. She
knew that she couldn't expect Xena
to reciprocate her love, but she could still fantasize. She
had vowed to take the secret of her
love for Xena to the grave, rather than endanger their
friendship. In the meantime,
she had to content herself with a stolen glance at her full body,
the feel of Xena's breasts against
her own whenever she gave her a friendly hug, the sound of
her voice as they spoke at night.</p>

<p>The sudden scuffle of boots against
gravel shook Gabrielle out of her reverie. She stopped in
her tracks and furtively looked around.
When she heard horses' hooves advancing toward
her, she hid behind a nearby tree.
Not knowing who was riding today, she didn't want to
take the chance that the approaching
horse belonged to an enemy. She stood quietly, and
listened intently.</p>

<p>A small horse cantered along the road,
a single female rider at the reins. Gabrielle breathed a
sigh of relief; from the brightly colored
adornments that fringed her mane, muzzle and saddle,
the horse was not a war-beast, but
a pampered steed of a well-to-do young woman. She
was about to resume her travels, to
rendezvous with Xena, when suddenly a trio of cutthroats
emerged swiftly from the bushes on
either side of the road. Gabrielle ducked back behind
the tree, eyes and ears open.</p>

<p>"Greetings, fine lady," the first wolfshead
bowed to the rider in mock civility. "It would seem
that your steed is over-burdened with
your riches. We can't have that, can we, boys?" he
motioned to his accomplices.</p>

<p>The three thugs laughed mirthlessly,
displaying foul mouths of uneven teeth. One of them
pulled a knife out of his belt, and
announced, "So we'll be relieving you of your unnecessary
burden."</p>

<p>"Leave me be, you unkempt fools," the
lady on the horse demanded. At the sound of her
voice, Gabrielle took her first look
at this woman; a statuesque beauty with long black hair
spilling down her shoulders, kept in
place only by an ivory comb. Smooth features set in
alabaster, but still animated and warm.
Her eyes, especially, dark brown jewels that seemed
to report more to her than just the
appearance of a thing, but the very nature of that thing.</p>

<p>"Unkempt fools?" the first thug shouted,
and his cohorts laughed anew at the insult. "I'm just
going to have to teach this whore a
lesson. Where I come from," he snarled at the woman,
brandishing his knife dangerously close
to the linen tunic that covered her breast, "a woman
knows her place!"</p>

<p>"Yeah," a voice suddenly shouted from
behind the thug. "Several rungs above the likes of
you!" Without warning, a blond
hurricane struck, whacking the hooligan upside the head with
her staff. She spun around, and
intercepted the two other thieves as they charged her. Their
pattern of attack was so predictable,
Gabrielle had time to wonder of roadside thugs along
the width and breadth of Greece had
read the same scroll on how to ambush wayfarers. She
held her staff horizontally in front
of her, and lunged forward toward the thugs. The staff
connected with both, hard enough to
knock the wind out of them.</p>

<p>"That's it," the lead ruffian shouted.
"I'll do you for that!"</p>

<p>"Hey," Gabrielle announced, leaning
on her staff, "I can keep this up as long as you can. But
my friend Xena will be coming along
this way any minute now--"</p>

<p>"Wait," the leader said, less loudly
than before, "did you say 'Xena'?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, Xena," Gabrielle smiled.
"Maybe you've heard of her? The Warrior Princess? The
Conqueror of Nations?" As she
spoke these words, she was greeted by the sight of three
fierce thieves losing their resolve,
scrambling to their feet and running for parts unknown.</p>

<p>The bard nodded knowingly, marveling
at the number of fights Xena had won without even
being there or even knowing about them.
She'd have to tell her about this one someday
soon.</p>

<p>Gabrielle approached the rider, who
had dismounted her horse and brushed off her tunic.
"Hello. I'm Gabrielle of Potedia.
Are you okay?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm fine," the woman answered.
"Just a little shaken, that's all. Gabrielle of Potedia,"
she nodded, offering her hand, "I thank
you for your timely assistance. I am Sappho."</p>

<p>Gabrielle's mouth hung slack, and her
knees threatened to give way under her. "Sappho?"
she breathed, unbelieving. "The
Tenth Muse? The poet of Lesbos?"</p>

<p>"Well, that's what the fliers say,"
Sappho mused, chuckling. "Publicists. Spawned in
Tartarus, each and every one of them."
</p>

<p>"By the Gods," Gabrielle whispered.
She hastily took the poet's hand in her own and shook
it vigorously. "It is an honor
to meet you. I have loved your work for so long, and if I could
write half as well as you, I would
die satisfied."</p>

<p>"Believe me, young bard," Sappho smiled,
"it's better to live satisfied. And usually easier."</p>

<p>Gabrielle laughed nervously at her idol,
then something Sappho said caught her attention.
"Wait a minute," she asked, "how did
you know I was a bard?"</p>

<p>"Word gets around in the literary community,
Gabs," Sappho started walking her horse down
the road, and Gabrielle joined her.
"I'm headed as far as the Temple of Aphrodite, ten
leagues from here. Where are
you headed?"</p>

<p>"I'm meeting a friend just two leagues
short of the temple," Gabrielle answered excitedly.
"Would you mind if I walked with you?"</p>

<p>"I'd be flattered," the poet beamed,
her smile warming Gabrielle's soul. As they walked,
Sappho continued to explain how she
knew of Gabrielle's reputation; "There has been much
talk about a bard who travels with
the famous Warrior Princess, Xena. When you mentioned
her, I put two and two together and
guessed that you were that bard. It is a pleasure to meet
you, Gabrielle. I have heard
some of the stories that you have told about Xena from second-
hand sources, and even in that muted
form, the tales were incredible."</p>

<p>"Oh, please," Gabrielle blushed to hear
such praise from one she admired so much. "I'm
nowhere near the wordsmith that you
are."</p>

<p>"Now how am I going to make this distinction,"
Sappho announced, "if I don't have the
evidence? Tell me a story.
About Xena."</p>

<p>Gabrielle was thunderstruck. The
greatest poet living, one blessed by the Muses themselves,
asking her to tell a story? She
felt butterflies careening around in her stomach, but the chance
to speak to her idol might never come
again. She rummaged through her pack, pulled out a
piece of nutbread and nibbled on it
for courage. She then tried to recall an adventure that she
and Xena had shared, one that was truly
memorable. After a few seconds, she began; "I sing
of Xena, the mighty princess forged
in the heat of battle. I sing of her trials against the
warrior queen Calisto, who cheated
Hades himself, to escape the underworld of Tartarus, to
return to the mortal world by inhabiting
Xena's very body--"</p>

<p>She continued her recitation as they
walked on, illustrating the finer points of her tale with
subtle hand gestures. Sappho
walked on silently as she took in the bard's every word in rapt
attention. When Gabrielle had
finished, Sappho stood quietly for a second, then brought her
hands together in loud and earnest
applause.</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you," Gabrielle said,
embarrassed at the acclaim she was enjoying.</p>

<p>"No, my bard, thank you," Sappho laughed
happily. "You have a great gift for words. Your
descriptions were so well crafted,
I could see these people in my minds eye. Don't ever
abandon your writing, or else the world
would lose a great treasure."</p>

<p>Gabrielle smiled shyly. She was
not used to such praise for her tales. She knew that Xena
always enjoyed hearing her retell their
adventures, or tell the tales of famous people of times
past, but she was never so vocal in
her praise.</p>

<p>Sappho went to her horse, and rummaged
through her saddlebag. She produced a small
scroll from the bag, and handed it
to Gabrielle. "I wish to give you this gift," she said
solemnly, "in gratitude for your defending
me from those wolfsheads, and as an appreciation
from one poet to another."</p>

<p>Gabrielle accepted the scroll with trembling
fingers. "It is a poem I wrote yesterday," Sappho
announced. "I was thinking that
I would recite it tonight at the Amphitheater in Lydia, but I
believe that you would be a more appreciative
audience."</p>

<p>"I am honored," Gabrielle enthused,
clutching the scroll to her heart. "I shall always treasure
this. Thank you."</p>

<p>"The pleasure is all mine," Sappho smiled
at the bard. "And soon, it will be all yours." she
added cryptically. She
mounted her horse, saying, "Xena should be along soon. I have to
be going." She waved goodbye
to Gabrielle, who waved back. Sappho tugged lightly on
her reins, and her horse trotted off
down the road.</p>

<p>Gabrielle looked at her new possession,
unsure whether she should read the text now, or
save it for later. She decided
to read it that night, maybe treating Xena to a little culture. She
felt deeply moved that the greatest
poet of her generation would give her a poem that she had
only written yesterday, that no one
had ever seen or heard before.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>That night, as Xena and Gabrielle sat
beside their campfire, Xena ate the last of the fish that
they had roasted over the fire, and
asked, "Hey, how did you make out at the market?"</p>

<p>"Oh, splendidly," Gabrielle announced.
"I was able to get everything on the list, plus a few
other items as well."</p>

<p>"Let me guess," the warrior grinned
knowingly, "parchments, pen nibs and nutbread."</p>

<p>"Am I that predictable?" Xena
only nodded. Gabrielle then remembered. "Oh, and I had a
little adventure on the way back here.
I ran into some thugs accosting a woman."</p>

<p>"And how did you fare?"</p>

<p>"Final score, Gabrielle, three, Thugs,
nothing. But the real news was their intended victim.
Sappho of Lesbos."</p>

<p>"The poet? My, quite the celebrity."</p>

<p>"Yeah, she and I got to talking, and
she even gave me this," she produced the scroll from her
pack. "An original piece of poetry
from the Tenth Muse herself."</p>

<p>"That's nice," Xena said with a complete
lack of enthusiasm. "Is it any good?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, well, I'm sure it is."</p>

<p>Xena turned toward her friend, "You
haven't read it yet?"</p>

<p>"No, not yet," the bard admitted.
"I was kind of saving it for tonight. I thought that you
would want to hear it."</p>

<p>Xena shrugged her shoulders. "Sure,
why not?"</p>

<p>Gabrielle smirked at Xena's blas&eacute;
attitude. "Try to contain your enthusiasm," she teased her
friend. She carefully unrolled
the scroll, and perused it briefly. She smiled at the title of the
poem; True Love's Touch. She
was puzzled by the inscription at the top of the scroll;</p>

<p><i>~To the Warrior and follower, may your
threads never be cut.</i></p>

<p>"Odd," she said, half to herself.
"She must have scribbled this in just before handing it to me."</p>

<p>"Maybe she knows her audience," Xena
suggested. "So, are you going to read it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah," Gabrielle stammered slightly,
before shifting into her bard's voice. Sitting by the
firelight, she began to read the poem
aloud, at first haltingly, trying to find the rhythm and
tempo. The dialect of Greek in
which the verse was written was slightly strange to her, but
after a few lines, she was able to
read it normally.</p>

<p>To Xena's ear, the words flowed out
of Gabrielle's mouth like honey. Sweet liquid
sentences, describing the joining of
two women, two soulmates, destined to be together
forever. Is that what Sappho
meant by her dedication; 'May your threads never be cut'?</p>

<p>Once Gabrielle was finished reading,
she looked at Xena, her eyes glazed over. At first
Xena thought that her eyes were just
teary. Her own eyes weren't exactly dry. "Thank you,
Gabrielle," she said, her voice thick
with emotion. "That was truly beautiful."</p>

<p>"Yes," Gabrielle whispered, inching
closer to the warrior. "Beautiful."</p>

<p>Xena regarded Gabrielle with a concerned
look. That poem seemed to have her worked up
about something. It was indeed
erotic, but she was surprised to see Gabrielle so affected.
"Is something wrong?"</p>

<p>"Beautiful," Gabrielle murmured, her
face now a mere handspan away from Xena's. "You are
so very beautiful." Before Xena
could react, Gabrielle had closed the distance between
them, and sealed the warrior's lips
with her own.</p>

<p>A tiny portion of Xena's brain realized
that the scroll contained not a poem but a spell. A
very powerful spell, one that forced
Gabrielle to try to seduce Xena. No matter how much
Xena had been in love with Gabrielle,
and desired to make love to her, she didn't want her
like this, not while Gabrielle wasn't
in full control of her faculties. So she resisted...for all of
three seconds. Then, Gabrielle's
fingers swiftly made their way under Xena's breast plate,
and tweaked the hardening nipple of
her right breast.</p>

<p>All thought of resistance ceased; perhaps
it was an aftereffect of the spell, she didn't care.
She seized Gabrielle's waist in her
powerful arms, and returned the kiss with equal fervor.
She opened her lips, and was surprised
to feel the bard's tongue pressing its way into her
own mouth. Their tongues explored
each other's mouths until the need for air forced them
apart, however briefly.</p>

<p>Xena gazed at Gabrielle, giddy with
the desire and lust that she knew her friend shared. "I've
wanted you for so long," she whispered
huskily. Gabrielle said nothing, only brought her face
closer to the warrior's for another
passionate kiss.</p>

<p>Soon, breastplate, tunic and all other
clothing were easily divested, and two women began to
explore the territories of their love
for each other.</p>

<p>A raven-haired beauty stood before the
alter of Aphrodite, declaring, "Oh great Aphrodite,
Perfection among women, Beauty of the
world, Faultless Goddess of love--"</p>

<p>Said goddess appeared in a cloud of
luminous smoke. "Yeah, yeah, yeah, tell me something
I don't know. So, Saph," the
golden haired goddess asked her petitioner. "How'd you make
out with Gabs?"</p>

<p>"She received the scroll with thanks,
oh Aphrodite," Sappho replied to the goddess, who
was twirling a lock of her hair around
her forefinger.</p>

<p>The Goddess of Love grinned mischievously.
"Oh, goody," she chirped, clapping her hands
with glee. "The show should be
starting now. We can watch it in my scrying pool." They
gathered around a fountain in the temple,
and Aphrodite waved her hand over the clear
waters.</p>

<p>Their reflections in the water faded,
and the image of the proud warrior, naked and
unashamed before her equally naked
bard, filled the pool. The bard trailed long sensuous
kisses along the warrior's shoulders,
the nape of her neck, and finally the slope of her breasts,
as Xena sucked in a sharp breath in
delight at this treatment. "Gotta say, I'm loving the
blonde's technique," Aphrodite giggled.
"Enjoying the show, Sapphy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Aphrodite," the poet breathed.
"Thank you for making me a part of their joining."</p>

<p>"Hey, that's nothing. You wrote
the poem that brought them together, I just gave it the
Aphrodite whammy. I've been a
bitch to those two in the past, I just figured it was time I do
something nice for them. And
considering how bad they got it for each other, I said to
myself, Self, howsabout we get those
two together?"</p>

<p>"But, my Goddess," Sappho asked, "What
will happen when they discover that Gabrielle is
to carry Xena's baby?"</p>

<p>"Those two?" Aphrodite chuckled, "They'll
be great parents. Surely Xena can look after the
kid. And if they start to wonder
who's the daddy, I'll go down and spell it out for them." She
turned toward Sappho, removing the
silver pin that fastened her pelops, letting the garment
drift to the floor, revealing her splendid
nude figure. "You have earned your reward,
Sappho."</p>

<p>"Thank you, oh Aphrodite," Sappho breathed,
lust coloring her cheeks as she slowly
removed her tunic. "I am honored
by your reward to me. Very few humans can say that
they've enjoyed the favors of the Goddess
of Love."</p>

<p>"Hey," Aphrodite winked at Sappho, her
desire matching the poet's, "how many gods can
say that they've been laid by the Tenth
Muse?" The two embodiments of love and passion
embraced and began to make love, even
as the two figures in the scrying pool continued to
love each other.</p>

<p>Sunnydale, California, October 1999</p>

<p>Buffy was exercising when Willow came
into their shared dorm room. She had music playing,
full blare, and it was all Willow could
do to keep from walking back out. "Hey!" She called
out, over the blaring of the CD player.
"Can I turn this down?"</p>

<p>Buffy, finally noticing Willow standing
there, nodded her head as she continued her fighting
moves. Willow noticed a package wrapped
in brown paper on her bed and walked over to
it. "Hey, what's this?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"Don't know." Buffy grunted. "It came
for you today." Sweat was pouring off of the Slayer's
face and Willow tried not to notice
how beautiful she was. Buffy wiped her face with the
towel she kept handy for just an occasion,
and went to sit on her bed. "Are you going to
open it, or just look at it for the
rest of the night?" Buffy asked, impatient to see what it was.
Her curiosity had been eating at her
all through her work out, and now she couldn't wait for
Willow to tear into the package.</p>

<p>Willow spared her best friend an appraising
look, then smirked at her. "Dying of curiosity,
aren't you?" She asked. She knew her
friend so well.</p>

<p>"Will! Would you just open it?!" Buffy
asked, exasperated. Though her excited smile took the
sting out of her words.</p>

<p>Willow chuckled, then opened the package,
finding a dusty old tome inside. "Oh!" Willow
gasped, excited. "It's the spell book
my friend said he was going to send me." Willow
couldn't wait to start shuffling through
the pages, looking for interesting spells that she wanted
to try.</p>

<p>"That's great, Will." Buffy said, smiling.
Now that her curiosity was sated she could get back
to her exercising. "Have fun." She
murmured, knowing Willow probably wouldn't poke her
head out of the book for a couple of
hours at least.</p>

<p>"Uh huh." Willow muttered, already lost
in reading the spells in the book. Buffy went over the
closet door and started doing chin-ups
on the frame. 'She gets so excited over those spells.'
Buffy thought, shaking her head and
chuckling.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Willow was turning the pages
of the book, reading the names of the spells on
each one when one of them caught her
eye. It was titled, 'True Love's Touch.' and the witch
that had written the spell had signed
her name underneath the title along with a dedication.
'Sappho', Willow thought to herself.
'Now there's an unusual name.' She vaguely
remembered a lesson in a history class
she had taken about a poet in Ancient Greece with the
name of Sappho, but she didn't remember
all that had been said about her. She had been
paying too much attention to Xander
and Buffy, who had been goofing off that day because
they were bored. But it struck her
odd that a witch had the same name of the ancient poet,
and it filled her with curiosity to
see what the spell was about. But first she read the
Dedication. Twice.</p>

<p><i>~To the Warrior and follower, may your
threads never be cut.</i></p>

<p>Willow thought the Dedication was rather
odd, and she didn't know what it meant, but it
struck her curiosity, so she decided
to read the spell to see if she could decipher the meaning
behind the words. By the time she finished
the page the spell was cast.</p>
