<p>Nietzsche once wrote that when you gaze into an abyss, the abyss gazes back
into you.
While I'm not one to take advise from someone who inspired Adolf Hitler, I
can say that he
was right on the money with that observation. I have stared into my
own abyss many times.
Hell, my hometown was built on an abyss. And only now can I tell
others about it. And I
have to tell the the world. It needs to know the truth about
her. About Buffy.</p>
<p>Yeah, I remember when it all started. When we fought the greatest
battle of our lives, against
the monster Adam. The battle that had cost the world its protector,
its Slayer.
The one whom I loved more than anyone else in the world, Buffy
Summers.</p>
<p>It was over a year ago, and only now do I have the courage to write
about her. Who she
was, what it was like to lose her, and what I had to go through to find her
again.</p>
<p>Before I get bogged down in angsty thoughts, let me just say that my story
does have an
upbeat ending. Well not really an ending, per se, since it's not over
yet, and I hope it won't
be for a long time. I went through Hell, both literally and
figuratively, to get to where I am
right now, I'm not going to lose what I have now.</p>
<p>Geez, even when I write I babble.</p>
<p>I guess that the reason I'm telling you that there is a happy ending is
because I don't want to
lose your interest right away. This is an important story I'm
writing, even if it will never see
publication in my lifetime. It's about the most important person,
IMHO("in my humble
opinion" for those who don't know cyberspeak), of the twentieth
century. Her name is Buffy
Summers, and you who are reading this story owe her your life. She
has literally saved you,
not to mention the rest of humanity, from the most terrible evils
imaginable. And in the
immortal words of Han Solo, "I can imagine quite a bit!"</p>
<p>Reading that last paragraph, it looks like I'm overstating Buffy's life
just a tad. I'm not. Buffy
Summers has quite literally saved the world at least six times that I know
of. If you're alive
today, it's because she has busted her butt to protect the world from the
things that go 'bump'
in the night.</p>
<p>And I of all people can say that. My name is Willow Rosenberg, and
I've been there beside
Buffy from shortly after Day One. She's been my friend, my
confidante, my sparring partner,
my college roommate, and finally my lover.</p>
<p>How does Giles put it? "In every generation there is the Chosen
One. She alone will stand
against the vampires, the demons and the forces of darkness. She is
the Slayer." That was
Buffy's destiny; the Slayer. Yes, virtually every myth, every
creature of your nightmares, they
all exist, or existed at one time. And my hometown of Sunnydale was
Ground Zero for these
beasties. Sunnydale was built over a Hellmouth, a portal to Hell
which brought forth all
manner of nasties. Really bad zoning, right? Apparently these
vampires and other demons
existed for as long as humanity, if not longer. And as long as
humanity existed, a select
handful of young women have had the capability to fight off the forces of
Hell. And Buffy, I
figure, was the best.</p>
<p>How do I know this? Personal experience. I've seen her execute
moves that would make
Michele Yeoh envious, turning whole platoons of vamps into piles of ash
with a well placed
spike or a volley of crossbow bolts. I could tell you stories about
the Master, Angelus,
Mayor Wilkins and the Ascension, Belial and Adam, that would freeze your
blood. No one
had ever faced evils like them before. But Buffy did. She not
only faced them, but at the
end, she was the only one who walked away from any of them.</p>
<p>Except Adam. She didn't walk away from that one. But that's
getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>Goddess, it seems like a lifetime ago. Cordelia and her follower
Harmony had been giving
me grief about my wardrobe again("the softer side of Sears", my pagan
ass!), when a blond
woman about my height shows up and tells Cordy and Harmony off! Then
she asks me for
some help with her homework. That was how I met Buffy. That was
about six years ago.
The day that my world, or at least my understand of the world, changed
forever.</p>
<p>Soon, I found myself hip-deep in horror-movie extras, watching this same
blond girl make
like the Terminator, dusting them right and left. Not long after
that, I, along with my
childhood friend Xander, my werewolf boyfriend Oz, and Xander's girlfriend
Cordelia (yes,
the same Cordy, go figure), fought the good fight alongside her. I
saw and learned so much
then; I met the cursed Angel, Buffy's first love, a vampire with a
soul. I faced down the
demonic Anya, the rogue slayer Faith, and my own vampiric double. I
learned from Giles'
girlfriend, Jenny Calendar(may God give her peace) about my own innate
talent for magic,
and began the long journey to becoming a true witch. All because a
woman named Buffy
Summers became my best friend.</p>
<p>Things changed again when we attended college together. Xander didn't
have the grades to
make it into college then, so he drifted from job to job. Oz and I
had drifted apart, he met up
with a female werewolf, and even after she died, he decided to leave
me. Losing him
devastated me briefly, but Buffy was always there. Always ready to
give me a shoulder to
cry on, even when I was giving off weapons-grade bitchiness. She
loved me like no one else,
and before long I realized that I loved her. We just were so used to
being best friends that it
hadn't occurred to us that we were more. But we were. It was
during the Belial fiasco that
we were able to confide our love for each other, and once the Belial threat
was eliminated,
Buffy and I began our real relationship. She and I made love for the
first time that night,
reveling in the new sensations, new pleasures, new emotions we were no
longer ashamed to
show. We were thick as thieves since then. Inseparable.
We made plans during spring
quarter to pool our resources to rent an apartment together. To live
together.</p>
<p>As usual, however, the Hellmouth had other ideas.</p>
<p>When did it start to go downhill? When Buffy started to investigate
the Initiative, a shadow-
ops organization that apparently was funded by the government to fight
supernatural evils,
kind of a vampire X-Files? When Maggie Walsh, the Initiative's senior
commander, set up
Buffy to be taken by an army of zombies? When her creation Adam, a
cross between a
demon and Locutus of Borg, broke free and killed her, then started
recruiting all the vampires
and demons in Sunnydale to help him destroy humanity?</p>
<p>I think that the blackness really started when Oz returned. He
claimed that he had gained
control of his werewolf side, and he wanted me back. By this time,
Buffy and I were
apartment hunting together, so I told him that what we had was long gone,
and that I loved
Buffy. He smiled, said simply that he understood, wished the two of
us luck, and left. I
remember Buffy looking at Oz as he left, and the expression on her face was
one of supreme
doubt. I've seen that look before, when what she called her
spider-sense started going off.
Something was wrong with Oz. </p>
<p>Then came that one day. One very bad day.</p>
<p>Buffy had gotten a hot tip from a mysterious demon named Whistler that Adam
was planning
something big at the rim of the Hellmouth, just outside of Sunnydale.
Naturally the Scooby
Gang was with her when she investigated, and Oz was with us. For a
little while, it was just
like old times; Xander, Oz, Buffy and me. Along with Tara, a good
friend of mine, who had
helped me gain control and confidence in my wiccan powers. Tara and I
had just discovered
a spell that would allow us to seal the Hellmouth forever, so Buffy's plan
was to push Cyber-
creep into the Hellmouth and close it behind him.</p>
<p>Adam, apart from looking like he was cobbled together from a morgue's spare
parts,
possessed a computer-like mind, complete with a disc-drive on his
chest. He absorbed
information by downloading discs. I had used my computer hacking
skills to encode a
special computer virus onto a disc, which Buffy would plant into Adam's
drive. The virus
would then play havoc with his memory, his motor skills, you name it,
giving Buffy the
opportunity to send him through the Hellmouth.</p>
<p>Sure enough, there was the Frankenstein monster's uglier brother using some
kind of spell to
drain off power from the Hellmouth, power that would make him
invincible. We tried to stop
him, but an army of demons stood between us and Adam. We had tough
going at first, but
we managed to thin out the demon horde(we of course meaning Buffy mainly,
but the rest of
us got our licks in). Finally Buffy confronted Adam, and they traded
blows.
Adam fought savagely, intent on the kill, while Buffy took a defensive
stance, pacing herself,
waiting for Adam to do something stupid. He obliged us by letting his
anger get the better of
him. He lunged repeatedly at Buffy, telegraphing his attacks enough
for Buffy to evade them.
Finally, she had enough of this dodge-and-duck game, so she dove low toward
Adam, who
tried to block her path. She got under him, then with lightning speed
she body-checked him
with her right shoulder. As he tumbled to the ground, she whipped out
the virus disc, and
popped it into his drive.</p>
<p>The effect was not unlike microwaving a tin can. He spasmed and
jerked around, trying to
stand, but Buffy kept kicking him, each blow sending him backward, toward
the Hellmouth
aperture he had erected. I clearly remember seeing her smile and
hearing her quip, "Tell the
Master Buffy says 'hi'," before delivering the final blow, the one that
sent Adam back to Hell.</p>
<p>Once Adam was swallowed by the Hellmouth, Tara and I recited the
spell. The spell was
working, the aperture was collapsing, and the Hellmouth was closing, when
it happened.</p>
<p>Oz, who had been fighting off demons with Xander, suddenly assumed a
transitional form,
between human and wolf, and jumped Buffy. "You shouldn't have taken
what wasn't yours,
Buff," he growled. "Don't worry, little girl, I'll take good care of
Willow!"</p>
<p>I stood there, thunderstruck, disbelieving what I was seeing. Oz, the
sweetest, kindest, most
gentle man I had ever known, had gone all Hannibal Lechter on the woman I
loved. "Oz!" I
pleaded with him. "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"Adam and I cut a deal, Wills," he snarled evilly at me, grabbing Buffy by
the throat. "I
betray Buffy, he'd give you to me as a gift. It seems that Adam lost,
so Plan B. You're mine,
Willow, and this dyke whore won't take you away from me!"</p>
<p>Xander charged at Oz, but the werewolf brushed him aside easily, clawing
him hard on the
side. Xander landed on the ground with all the grace of a wounded
hippopotamus, rolling in
pain. Seeing Buffy struggling against Oz's grip, Xander wounded by
Oz, and the look of
madness in his eyes, finally triggered me to act. With a scream of
rage, I ran at Oz, intent on
clawing his eyes out. His laughter was like the baying of a mad dog
at the moon. He
knocked me aside with his free arm, and as I landed on my butt, he lifted
Buffy off the ground
and hurled her into the closing Hellmouth. I ran to the aperture,
desperate to grab Buffy, to
somehow pull her out, but the aperture closed behind her. And Oz just
stood there, proud of
his betrayal. </p>
<p>He turned toward me, and grinned wickedly, his teeth sharp and glistening
with his saliva.
"You belong to me, Willow," he barked, stalking closer to me. His
eyes glowed with
unearthly power, with lust, with evil. The Oz I knew and once loved
didn't live in that beast
anymore. Laying on the ground where I had landed, I grasped around
me, looking for a
weapon, anything to put down this mad dog. There was nothing, not
even a small stake. I
tried to crawl away from him, but he pinned me with his knees, and began to
leer at me. In
terror, I held on to the only thing I had left of Buffy, my half of the
Mizpah coin we shared,
the piece of silver jewelry that signified our bond, our love for each
other. The bond that had
been severed by Oz's treachery.</p>
<p>A piece of silver.</p>
<p>I yanked it off of my neck, and used the edge of the coin to slash at Oz's
face. He reeled in
pain, jumping back away from me. "You slut!" he screamed, "I'll kill
you for that!"</p>
<p>"You already killed me!" I shouted, wielding the coin like a knife in front
of me. "You took
Buffy away from me! The Oz I knew wouldn't do that!"</p>
<p>"The Oz you know is dead," he growled, charging at me again.</p>
<p>"Well, why don't you join him?" I cried, throwing myself into a flying
tackle. I pounded him
back, into the ground, then before he had the time to get back up, I dug
into his neck with the
coin. I slashed deeply, hitting the carotid artery, and his lifeblood
gushed out like a torrent.
Within seconds, he had died.</p>
<p>I was only vaguely aware of events after that. I knew that Tara was
tending to Xander's
wounds, while Giles had pulled me away from the werewolf's corpse.
They had taken me
back to Giles' house, tended to my scratches and tried to feed me. I
remembered to bathe,
to clean myself, to pee when I had to, that was it. For two days, I
existed in a hazy half-life
state. Finally, the enormity of what had happened hit me; Oz,
the first person I truly loved,
had betrayed us, only to die at my hands.</p>
<p>And Buffy Summers, the one I loved more than anyone else, was gone
forever.</p>
<p>I was aware of Giles holding me as I cried. His support, his caring,
were the only things
keeping me from falling into the abyss. Xander had been standing
there beside him, offering
what little support he could, as was Tara. I just wept bitterly, not
knowing what would
happen tomorrow, and not wanting to know. Sure, we had saved the
world, once again,
allowed humanity to sleep peacefully as another demonic threat was
eliminated. </p>
<p>None of it mattered.</p>
<p>All I knew was that I had lost the love of my life. I had lost
Buffy.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, no one attended the burial of Daniel 'Oz' Ozbourne.
I had visited his
grave once, since then, to spit on it.</p>
<p>Buffy's parents were together for her memorial service. It was the
first time that I had met
her father. He wouldn't even look at me. I don't know if
he simply disapproved of Buffy
and I being lovers, or whether he blamed me for her death. He didn't
need to, I was blaming
myself for it plenty. I don't think that Joyce had said ten words to
the man during the whole
time he was here.</p>
<p>Giles delivered a eulogy for the fallen Slayer, and I could see the tear
tracks on his face. He
hadn't been this distraught since Angelus killed his girlfriend
Jenny. When I took the podium
to speak of my beloved, I recited a poem, 'Funeral Blues', by W. H. Auden,
with some slight
pronoun changes for gender;</p>
<p>"Turn off the clocks and disconnect the phone.
Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone.
Silence the piano with a muffled drum;
Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.</p>
<p>Let airplanes circle mournfully overhead,
Scribbling in the sky the message, "She is dead".
Put crepe ribbons on the white necks of the public doves.
Tell the policeman to wear black cotton gloves.</p>
<p>She was my north, my south, my east, my west,
My working week, and my Sunday rest.
My noon, and my evening, my talk and my song.
I thought that love would last forever. I was wrong.</p>
<p>The stars are not needed, shut off every one.
Put away the moon and dismantle the sun.
Tear down the ocean and sweep away the wood,
For nothing now can ever come to any good."</p>
<p>Joyce Summers led me off the podium as I wept again. She invited me
to stay with her if I
needed to, but I declined. I just wanted to be alone, and I couldn't
take her sympathy, not
when it was my fault that she had lost her daughter.</p>
<p>I had convinced Buffy that Oz was okay, that he was still one of us.
I had no idea that he
would turn against us, that he would sell us out to claim me. He was
obsessed with me, and
had used our old relationship to get close enough to Buffy to stab her in
the back. I may as
well have taken a gun to her temple and pulled the trigger. I was as
responsible for Buffy's
death as anyone. And all I could do was blame myself.</p>
<p>I had continued to blame myself for months after that, making myself more
miserable with
each passing day. Eventually the numbness wore off, and I had managed
to go on with some
semblance of a life. I returned to college, continuing my criminology
major, but I dropped the
wicca practice. I had given up on the idea of using my witchcraft to
help others, I knew that I
was no good at it. All the magic in the world couldn't save Buffy,
could it?</p>
<p>It wasn't until nearly a year after Buffy's final battle that my battle had
really begun. And what
I thought was the end, was just the beginning.</p>

<p align=center><i>--The Verve "Bittersweet Symphony"</i></p>

<p>I had just moved in to the new place.  I had decorated it myself; earth tones mostly, dark
greens and browns, warm and friendly colors, a mountain of paisley throw pillows on the
couch, Coca-Cola ad art in the kitchen, my computer in the bedroom, all the comforts of
home.  All in all, I thought, the place was shaping up nicely.</p>

<p>There was just one element that was missing.  One element that would always be missing.
Buffy.</p>

<p>Just after the funeral, Joyce(it still feels weird calling her Joyce, after all these years.) gave me
a box containing some of Buffy's things, things she thought that Buffy would want me to have.
Her CD collection, some old books and movie videos, the sweater I had given her for her
19th birthday(the only one we got to celebrate before Adam), and Mr. Gordo, her stuffed
monkey.  I had taken to sleeping with Mr. Gordo in my arms.  A poor surrogate for his
former owner, but he was all I had of her.</p>

<p>I hadn't actively sought companionship after losing Buffy, and I knew that I wouldn't.  Buffy
was the one true love of my life, I realized that as I lost her.  No one would ever touch my
heart, my soul, as deeply as she did.  So I threw myself into college, into my work.  I had
taken an at-home job with a small software company called Cybermancers Media, a
company that specialized in applications software and fantasy-themed computer games.  I
made a little bit as one of their regular beta-testers, helping to work out the bugs in their new
products.  I also created a role-playing game based on the movie "Buckaroo Bansai"(a guilty
pleasure of my childhood), which, surprisingly enough, became the company's biggest seller.
I was paid handsomely for the game, and used the money to purchase the townhouse where I
now lived.  I figured I'd better cover my nut, and living rent-free has its advantages.  Beta-
testing doesn't pay a whole hell of a lot, but it's better than most 'joe jobs'.  Plus
Cybermancers wanted me to design more software for them.</p>

<p>I had just placed a neon-blue lava lamp(Xander's housewarming gift)on a shelf in the living
room, when the doorbell chimed(a Westminster chime, came with the house).  I answered
the door, and was greeted by a hug from Tara.  "Beware of Wiccans bearing gifts," she
announced cheerily, her voice like a sleigh bell.  She shoved a large gift box into my arms,
saying, "Good to see you, friend."</p>

<p>"Tara," I said, pleased at her appearance.  "How've you been?"</p>

<p>"Not bad, Willow," she answered.  "So you gonna open the box or what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah," I suddenly remembered the package.  I tore off the bright wrapping paper and
lifted the lid off the box.  Nestled within the Styrofoam peanuts was a clay statue of the Earth
Goddess, a rotund figure with huge round breasts.  Glazed in a smooth chocolate brown with
beige highlights.  "A good luck totem," Tara explained, "to bless this house."</p>

<p>"It's beautiful," I answered, touched by her thoughtfulness.  "Here, let me find a suitable place
for it," I added, clearing away part of the coffee table, displaying the Goddess prominently in
the center of the living room.  "How's that?"</p>

<p>"Perfect," Tara announced.  "Even matches your color scheme.  So, when do I get the fifty-
cent tour?"</p>

<p>"Sure," I answered, taking her by the hand, and leading her through the house.   I showed her
my bedroom, the computer station, the kitchen, all the basic stuff.  I had told her about my
job as a beta-tester, about my college courses, my family.  She told me about her folks, her
studies, the major events of her life.</p>

<p>"I've missed you, Willow," she said as we faced each other on the sofa while munching on a
vegetarian pizza.  "Missed hanging out, doing spells with you.   Hey, there's a new coven
opening up on campus, why don't you join?"</p>

<p>I turned away from her as she made her offer.  "I'm not into the magic scene these days.  I
kinda gave it up after Buffy..."</p>

<p>"Hey, Willow," Tara placed her hand on mine.  "Buffy wouldn't want you to mourn forever.
You've got to move on."</p>

<p>"I have, Tara," I said, semi-convincingly.  "I'm still going to school, I've got a good job, I'm
happy with my life."</p>

<p>I felt a hand on my shoulder.  "Willow, look at me," she whispered.  "I'm your friend, I know
you.  You've seen so much in your life, such evil, such terror.  But you've overcome it all, and
kept that special something that still makes you who you are.  But I'm worried about you.
You've been growing apart from the rest of us.  When's the last time you saw Giles?  Or
Xander?  They're your friends, don't shut them out now."</p>

<p>"I haven't shut them out!" I replied, maybe a little too loudly.  I saw Tara flinch as I shouted,
so I lowered my voice.  "I still see them.  I just saw Xander two weeks ago.  He said he was
fine, that he was doing well in community college.  Hey, he just called yesterday, and he
wants me to meet him at the Bronze today."</p>

<p>"Any reason given?" Tara asked.</p>

<p>"No, he's gone all 'it's a surprise' on me."</p>

<p>"Well," Tara asked, "are you going?"</p>

<p>I stalled, not sure what to say.  "I dunno, Tara," I finally admitted.  "I haven't been there in
months."</p>

<p>"I understand," she answered.  I felt her hand gently massaging my shoulder, and sensed her
lips closer to mine.  "But you should get out of your shell sometime.  It isn't healthy to lock
yourself away from the world.  Please, Willow, let me help you."</p>

<p>Moved by her genuine concern, I leaned forward into a friendly hug.  "I'm glad you're my
friend, Tara," I whispered.  She didn't say anything to me, she just held me, the way I needed
to be held.  She leaned her head toward mine, and I could just barely feel her lips pressing
against my neck.  I found myself leaning toward her face, and before I knew it, her mouth
was on mine.</p>

<p>I had never touched anyone since losing Buffy.  I found that I missed that contact.  And it
would have been so easy to surrender to Tara's ministrations.  She was clearly eager to
continue.  I had been aware of her attraction to me from the first time we met.  And once I
even entertained returning her affection.  But she knew, and I knew that my heart belonged to
Buffy.</p>

<p>I guess it still did, even one year later.</p>

<p>Before the kiss could increase in intensity, I backed off.  "I can't," I said feebly, as I got off
the couch.  "It wouldn't be fair, not to you."</p>

<p>"Willow," she argued, "all we did was kiss."</p>

<p>"Yeah, all we did," I answered.  "But if we had gone from there...I..." I stopped my train of
thought, before I could start babbling incoherently(always one of my greatest faults, although
Buffy had told me more than once that she found it endearing), and started over;  "Look,
Tara, you're my friend, and yes, you're as sexy as all get out, but I can't and won't use you as
a substitute Buffy.  Please, I'm sorry, just don't...just don't."</p>

<p>Tara said nothing for a few seconds, and I was afraid that I had hurt her.  Finally, she just
smiled sadly at me and said, "I understand, Willow.  And I'm glad that you think that I'm
sexy.  The truth is that I have always been attracted to you.  I would love nothing more than
for you to carry me off to your bedroom and have your way with me.  But you're right.  I
wouldn't take advantage of you that way.  But maybe someday, when the hurt is less," she
added, with just a hint of pleading in her eyes, "you'll consider giving me a try?"</p>

<p>I looked at her, considering her offer.  "Maybe," I sighed, "but I wouldn't get your hopes up."</p>

<p>"Hey," she half-laughed.  "What are hopes for if not to be raised?"  She patted me on the
back, just a friendly kind of touch, and said, "C'mon, Willow, I'm taking you to the Bronze,
even if I gotta hogtie you to get you there.  And before you say anything, no, I'm not into
bondage!"</p>

<p>"Yeah right, 'Tara, Mistress of Pain'?  I don't see it."  I laughed at her comment, and was
grateful to be able to laugh.  "Okay, let me get my jacket."  </p>

<p align=center>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>

<p>It had been over six months since I had last stepped into the Bronze, and nearly fifteen
minutes after I walked in, I was ready to get out.  Six months ago, I had tried to put up a
brave front and go on with my life.  As soon as I had entered the Bronze then, I noticed the
band playing.  The former members of Oz's old band the Dingoes had regrouped under a
new lead singer and a new name, Evil Petting Zoo.  Watching Oz's old friends brought Oz
back to my mind, and I wanted to vomit.  To think that I had let him touch me, kiss me, make
love to me.  To remember how he hurt me when he left, and then how he betrayed us all by
killing Buffy.  I had to run from the Bronze immediately, and I couldn't set foot in it since.</p>

<p>I finally screwed my courage to the sticking-place, and entered the Bronze.  At first it wasn't
bad.  A deejay was handling the music that night, and the dance floor was packed with young
people, singles, couples and groups, all having fun.  I tried to dance myself, and found that I
liked it.  "Smooth", Santana's duet with Rob Thomas was playing, and I was starting to feel
no pain.  That was the ticket, I thought, just shake and shimmy it off.  For a few minutes,
hearing Matchbox 20 and Lauren Hill, life was good again.</p>

<p>Then they had to play that damn Pearl Jam song.  Their cover of Wilson Frank's "Last Kiss".
The refrain stabbed at me like a knife to the heart;</p>

<p>"Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me.
She's gone to heaven, so I gotta be good,
So I can see my baby when I leave this world."</p>

<p>It had occurred to me then that I didn't even have that option.  Buffy wouldn't be waiting for
me in Heaven, thanks to Oz.  She was in Hell, because of his actions.  I could only hope that
she had a good view of his suffering in Hell as well.  Maybe if I became evil--oh Goddess,
what was I thinking?</p>

<p>Tara noticed my face when the Pearl Jam song played.  She took my arm and led me to a
table, saying, "Oh no you don't, Wills.  You're not bailing out now.  We'll wait for Xander
here."  She sat me down on a pile of cushions, and signaled for a waiter.  "Two spring
waters, please," she ordered, and the waiter left.</p>

<p>Trying to ignore the song, I glanced around the room, taking in the time-honored occupation
of people-watching.  Several couples hit the floor, most hetero, one consisting of two girls.  I
remembered fondly how Buffy and I would burn up the dance floor together, not caring what
people thought of us.  We occasionally had to deal with some mean-spirited homophobe or
pervert who wanted to make it a threesome, but never any threats of violence or truly hateful
gestures.  I smiled as I saw the two girls gyrated on the floor, oblivious to all but each other.
Me and Buffy, we were like that.  So in tune with each other's moods, each other's thoughts,
each other's bodies.  When we danced together, when we held each other, when we made
love, it was like a symphony.  Each movement orchestrated, yet we were always able to ad-
lib, to improvise, and to pick up from each other's improvisations.  It was like unto a work of
art.</p>

<p>The memory of her love would still sustain me.  It had to.  It was all I had left.</p>

<p>"Hey, Willow, look," Tara pointed excitedly.  "Giles."  I followed the path of her finger, and
sure enough, there was our favorite Watcher(that is to say, the only member of the Watcher's
Council that we Scoobs didn't despise!), looking quite out of place amid the younger, and
more casually dressed, clientele.  He still had his genetic disposition for tweed, his old jacket
with the leather patches at the elbows must have been hot under the bright lights of the
Bronze.  He looked around nervously, found us, and moved toward our seats.</p>

<p>"Giles?" I asked, amazed to see him here.</p>

<p>"Yes, I received a message from Xander to meet him here," he admitted, sliding his finger
under the collar of his shirt.  "So," he added, looking around.  "This is the Bronze?  So
named, no doubt, because you could smelt bronze in this heat."</p>

<p>"Hey," Tara teased him, "you see anyone else wearing tweed?"</p>

<p>"Take the jacket off," I suggested, "you'll be a lot more comfortable."</p>

<p>"I'll take the jacket off," Giles said, "but I don't think I'll be any more comfortable."  He
removed his jacket, placed it on the back of a chair, and sat down.  "Believe me, this doesn't
change my opinion of your generation's approach to music," he added, having to raise his
voice to be heard, even out of the way of the amplifiers as we were.</p>

<p>"Is it not the duty of each generation to annoy the previous generation with their style of
music, dress and other tastes?" someone asked behind us.  Tara and I turned toward the
familiar voice, and that's when we saw him.</p>

<p>Xander, wearing a pale blue short-sleeved shirt.</p>

<p>And a badge.</p>

<p>And an empty gun holster.</p>

<p>Giles' jaw was hanging freely from his face, while Tara's eyes were bugging out of their
sockets.  "Oh my goddess," she whispered.  She stood up, appraised Xander's uniform, and
smiled gleefully.  "Xander!  You joined the Village People!"  She laughed loudly, and started
waving her hands above her head, singing; "It's fun to stay at the Y---M, C, A!"</p>

<p>"Funny, Tara," Xander answered, smiling.  "Seriously, people, as of today, I am Officer
Alexander Harris of the Sunnydale PD!"</p>

<p>"You serious?"  I asked.  "You're not pulling our legs?"</p>

<p>"Not even a slight tug," Xander answered.  "I'm now a cop.  Whaddya think?"</p>

<p>Tara, Giles and I just glanced at each other, appraising each other's looks.  Giles then stood
up, and grasped Xander's hand firmly.  "Congratulations, boy," he announced.  "I want you to
know that I am inordinately proud of you."</p>

<p>"Yeah, so am I," I added, my mouth finally catching up with my brain.  Tara also shook his
hand, saying, "You'll make a fine officer, Xander."</p>

<p>"Thanks for the vote of confidence, Tara," Xander said, smiling.  I could see it in his eyes, his
stance, his posture.  He hadn't just decided two weeks ago that he was going to be a cop.
Ever since his demon-girlfriend Anya disappeared after the final battle with Adam ('Good
Riddance' I thought), I was afraid that Xander would be even more directionless than I was.
But instead, apparently, he used her departure as the impetus to finally change his life.  I had
been aware that he was attending the community college to achieve his GURs (General
Undergraduate Requirements), but I had no idea that he was attending the police academy as
well.  I guess if you get kicked in the butt enough times, you start to get moving.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm walking the beat at nights right now," Xander explained as we sat down and
talked further.  "No glamour, but after dealing with vampires on a regular basis, it's the
proverbial walk in the park.  Besides, now that the Hellmouth's closed for good, I needed to
feel useful again.  And wearing this uniform somehow does that for me.  It's hard to explain,
really.  It's like I finally feel like I belong on this planet, like I'm not just visiting.  You know
what I mean?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," I answered ruefully.  Ever since losing Buffy, I thought much the same thing about
myself.  When was I going to finally feel like my being here was justified?</p>

<p>A crash of glass from the skylight shattered my latest go-round of self pity, as a figure
plunged down from the roof onto the dance floor.  The figure stood up, glared at the dancers,
and morphed into its game face.  A vampire.  Even though the Hellmouth was no longer a
going concern, there were still a few odd vampires around.  I knew that Giles was taking care
of most of them, mostly inexperienced newbies, or weakened by lack of blood.  This one,
however, looked like a veteran.  Obviously one who knew its business.  It grabbed at one of
the girls on the floor, and held her in a hammerlock.  "Nobody moves, nobody dies!" it
shouted.  "I'm just gonna take my girlfriend out for a walk, nobody follows me.  Got it?"</p>

<p>The girl, a young(I guessed 18) Asian featured young woman, smiled at her assailant, and
said, "Got it!" She then threw the beast over her, and into the wall.  She then withdrew a
wooden stake and easily impaled the monster.  The vampire was quickly reduced to ash, and
the crowd looked aghast at what they had seen.</p>

<p>The young woman turned toward us, and smiled at us.  Walking toward our seats, she
nodded, saying, "You must be the Scooby Gang.  My watcher's told me so much about you.
Oh, I'm Sandra Ogawa.  The new Slayer.  My watcher should be around here somewhere,
she wanted to observe me in action."</p>

<p>"Indeed," a rich, chocolate voice rang out behind Sandra.  Emerging from the crowd was a
svelte black woman, mid-thirties I guessed.  Her voice was lightly accented in British, and her
walk was confident.  She regarded us with a look of amusement, and then turned toward
Giles.  "Hello, Ripper," she greeted the surprised ex-Watcher.</p>

<p>Giles blinked as he recognized the new Watcher.  "Denise!  My word, it's good to see you."</p>

<p>"Surprisingly enough, Rupert," she smiled sweetly, "the feeling's mutual."</p>

<p>We all stood around, looking at the two Watchers, until finally Xander, in his unique style,
said, "I'm going out on a limb here; you two know each other."</p>

<p>"Indeed we do," Giles answered, slightly flustered as he realized that we were in the room
with him.  He started to introduce us; "Willow, Tara, Xander, this formidable woman is
Denise Parkinson, the youngest person ever named to the Watcher's Council."</p>

<p>"And," she added, "the first to leave it voluntarily.  But by no means the last."  This revelation
surprised Giles even further.  "Oh yes, Giles.  The Watcher's Council is in disarray.  That's
one of the reasons I came here.  But perhaps we could talk somewhere where the decibel
level is below that of a jet engine at full throttle."</p>

<p>"A capital idea," he answered.  "Let us adjourn to my townhouse."</p>

<p align=center>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>

<p>"...So the Watcher's Council renounced Quentin's actions in the Belial Incident, as they called
it," Denise explained.  "They told the rest of the Watchers and Slayers in training that Quentin
acted independently of the Council, and that they would never condone one of their own
making a pact with a demon."  We all shivered at the thought; Xander, Giles and myself were
present when Quentin and the demon Belial hammered out the contract that would have given
Sunnydale over to the Hellmouth.  If it weren't for a time-traveling Buffy from the future,
Belial would have unleashed the forces of the Hellmouth on the world.</p>

<p>"You believe them?" Giles asked, his voice tinged with skepticism.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't believe them if they said that water was wet," Denise barked.  "Increasingly, I've
been finding evidence that the Council has been more interested in controlling their Slayers,
not aiding them.  Take the case of Sandra here.  A year and a half ago, they tried to force me
to inject her with muscle relaxant, to weaken her for some rite of passage.  The muscle
relaxant would probably have killed her.  That's when I decided to leave the council, and
take Sandra with me.  Too many lies, half-truths, cover-ups.  And judging from what I've
heard, I'm not the only one who feels that way.  Indeed many Watchers have defected, to
strike out on their own.  I have no wish for the Council to undermine Sandra's efforts.
Sandra has proven to be an effective Slayer, one of whom I am quite proud..."</p>

<p>"Please, Ms. Parkinson," Sandra blushed.  "Not in front of the Scooby Gang."</p>

<p>Denise snickered at Sandra's embarrassment.  "Anyway, one of the reasons that I came here
was to speak with you, Rupert.  I wish to discuss rebuilding the Watcher's Council.  You are
one of the few senior watchers, even if you no longer hold that title personally.  The Council
needs to be rebuilt."</p>

<p>Giles seemed genuinely moved by her entreaty.  "I appreciate your thinking of me in that
regard," Giles stated.  "I have no desire to return to England, however..."</p>

<p>"Who said the Council has to be located in England?" Denise asked.  "It's that blind devotion
to tradition and ritual that has kept the Council grounded in the Dark Ages.  With modern
communications, with the Internet, there wouldn't be the need for the senior Watchers to be
away from the action, so to speak."</p>

<p>"Watch it, Parkinson," Xander quipped.  "You're talking to the last of the red hot Luddites
over here."</p>

<p>"Yes, his hatred of modern technology has become the stuff of legends," Denise joked.  I
started to like her immediately, which surprised me, considering my opinions about the
Watcher's Council in general.  </p>

<p>"Actually," she continued, "Giles has become something of a legend among the rank and file
himself, him and Buffy.  The senior Watchers may have had little use for you, but you are
much admired among your peers.  That's why I hope that you'll consider my proposal.  If you
were to be instrumental in reconstructing the Council, many of the other Watchers would
follow your lead."</p>

<p>Giles pursed his lips and hummed thoughtfully.  "An intriguing offer, Denise.  I will have to
consider it."</p>

<p>"That's all I ask, Rupert."</p>

<p>"So, how about you, Sandra?" Tara asked, leaning in closer.  "When did you become a
slayer?"</p>

<p>"About two years ago," Sandra answered.  "All I knew was that some--thing was attacking
my mother, then I'm making like Keanu Reeves from 'The Matrix'."</p>

<p>"Okay," Xander figured it out.  "She must have become the next slayer when Buffy sent Faith
into a coma."  Giles nodded in agreement, recalling Buffy's battle with the psycho- slayer.</p>

<p>"Do you enjoy being a slayer?" Tara asked.  I could sense that she was starting to like this
new slayer.</p>

<p>"I'll admit, it's not the life I signed on for," Sandra spoke for the first time.  A bit of a quiet
one, she was.  "But once I got started, I began to feel a responsibility.  And from what
Denise has told me, reading me the reports on Buffy Summers, I've kind of taken to her as a
role model.  I was sorry to hear of her passing, but I can only hope that I can follow in her
footsteps."</p>

<p>"Just remember to brush up on your jokes," Xander offered.  "It ain't enough to slay
vampires, you gotta humiliate 'em."</p>

<p>"And don't forget to name your favorite stake," Tara offered.  "Buffy called hers Mr. Pointy."
I sat there silently, watching as my friends slipped effortlessly into their old roles.  Like they
hadn't gotten out of high school.</p>

<p>"And you, Mr. Giles," Sandra asked, "what would you advise?"</p>

<p>"Me?  Well," Giles pondered the question.  "Listen to your Watcher.  But first, listen to your
instincts.  Buffy was never afraid to let me know when she thought that I was wrong.  Trust
your instincts.  They're you're greatest asset as a Slayer.  They'll never let you down."</p>

<p>"Thank you Mr. Giles," Sandra then turned to me.  "And you, Willow?  I understand that you
were closer to Buffy than anyone else.  Would you have any advice for me?"</p>

<p>I looked at her, amazed that she would ask me, the one who got Buffy killed in the first place,
for advice.  I just kept looking at her, until I started to chuckle.  My chuckle quickly turned
into a maniacal laugh, as everything I've kept bottled up for the last year just spilled over like
bad yeast.</p>

<p>"You want my advice?" I said, my voice rising with every word. "I'll give you some advice.
Go home.  Go back to where you came from.  Get the hell out of Dodge.  Forget you ever
met us, forget you ever heard of Watchers, or Slayers, or vampires or any of that crap
because all it'll get you is an early grave!  It doesn't matter, none of it does!  You'll get killed
by some random vamp or werewolf or something, then another slayer will show up, and it all
starts over again!  IT DOESN'T MATTER!"  </p>

<p>It wasn't until I noticed Tara removing her hands from her ears that I realized that I was
shouting at the top of my lungs.  I looked around at the others, seeing shock, hurt, concern
and pity in their eyes.  I couldn't take it, not the pity.  I had to get out.  Not saying a word, I
grabbed my coat, and rushed out the door.  I didn't know where I was going, nor did I care.</p>

<p>I just had to get away.</p>

<p align=center><i>"Though much is taken, much abides; and though<br>
We are not now that strength which in old days <br>
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are - <br>

<p align=center><i>--Alfred Lord Tennyson</i></p>

<p>I ran until my lungs threatened to burst.  I ran until my legs were ready to collapse.  It still
wasn't enough.</p>

<p>I was running away from my friends, my past, myself.  And I knew that I couldn't run from
them forever.  Sooner or later, they all would find me.</p>

<p>I could deal with my friends.  Even with my past.  But myself...</p>

<p>That voice was always there.  Condemning me, damning me for what I had done.  I had
never shared that shame before, I couldn't.  If the other Scoobs knew what I had done, how
I had betrayed Buffy...</p>

<p>As I stopped to rest, I looked around to see where I was; the middle of Whetherly Park,
once the prime trolling ground for Sunnydale's vamps, now as safe as any park in America.  I
noticed the swing-set where I had played many times before, as a kid, with Xander pushing
me, and later, in high school, with Buffy, just sitting in the swing next to me.  We would talk
about everything and nothing, and not care whether we resolved any issues, had made any
decisions, or had changed our lives in any way.  Just to be together, best friend to best friend.  </p>

<p>And that was years before we fell in love.  No, I take that back.  Years before we realized
that we were always in love with each other.</p>

<p>And I killed her.</p>

<p>I just sat on the swing, the one on the left side, the one where I always sat.  I kept looking at
the other swing, the one where Buffy always sat, expecting to see her there, but knowing that
she was never coming back.  I couldn't think, I couldn't cry, I couldn't breath.  I found myself
hoping that this was it.  My death, to make up for hers.</p>

<p>"Hey, Wills," a familiar voice greeted me.  Damn, still among the living.</p>

<p>I didn't say anything as Xander sat in Buffy's old swing.</p>

<p>"Gotta say, Wills," he continued, "not liking the fatalistic attitude."</p>

<p>"Gotta say, Xand," I answered, tonelessly, "not giving a rat's ass."</p>

<p>Xander looked at me, I could feel his eyes on me, I could feel his warmth, his caring, his
generosity of soul.  I knew that if he knew what I had done, he'd forgive me on the spot.</p>

<p>I didn't want him to forgive me.  I didn't deserve it.</p>

<p>"This is the part where I ask if you want to talk about it," he quipped, "and you say you'd
rather be alone.  But that ain't gonna happen.  Because I don't think it would be good to
leave you alone."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Xander," I tried to put a happy face on, knowing that he wouldn't buy it, "but I'll be
fine.  I'll apologize to Giles in the morning."</p>

<p>"What about Sandra?" he asked.  "You think you should apologize to her?"</p>

<p>"Why?" I turned to Xander, not caring if my facade of well being was fading.  "I was just
telling her the truth.  She's caught in a dead-end career, literally, and if she doesn't get out,
she'll end up like Buffy."</p>

<p>Xander appraised me, the sadness and caring in his eyes touching me like a searchlight.
Seeing into my soul.  I wanted to get away, but I was to tired.   He finally said, sadly, "You
still haven't mourned for her, have you?"</p>

<p>"I've been mourning for her every day this last year, and will mourn her for the rest of my life,"
I exclaimed.  "Don't you talk to me about mourning."</p>

<p>"Well," Xander huffed, getting out of his swing and facing me, his voice approaching a shout.
"That's pretty damn selfish of you."  I pulled away as he said it, not believing what I heard.
"You think you have the monopoly on mourning Buffy, just because you two shared orgasm
priviliges?"</p>

<p>My hand flew hard onto Xander's face before I knew what I was doing.  I felt my hand ball
itself into a fist, I heard the smack, felt the sting of his cheek on my knuckles, then it
registered; I had hit my childhood friend.  Hard.</p>

<p>He just looked back at me, and half-smiled, through a red swell that was soon to become a
livid bruise.  "Okay, I was out of line.  But you're not the only one who misses her.  Hell, I
miss her every day.  Not a day goes by when I don't think about her, expect her to tell me to
shut up after I tell an awful pun, or give me her regular pep talk when things get rough for me.
But I've let go of the pain, I got through it.  And if you think that you're being fair to Buffy by
keeping  your pain alive, then here's a hot news flash for you; you're not."</p>

<p>I sat there, not believing what I had done.  I just rocked gently on the swing as he stood
before me, wanting to help, wanting to shout, wanting to slug me if that was what it took.
The dam had to burst.  I couldn't shore it up anymore.</p>

<p>"I--I killed her, Xander," I said, as the tears fell unchecked.  I sobbed openly, as Xander
scooped me up in his arms, holding me in a bear hug, assuring me, "No, Willow, no you
didn't.  If you're gonna blame someone, blame Oz.  He's the one who pushed her into the
Hellmouth."</p>

<p>"And I'm the--I'm the one," I continued between sobs, "who convinced her--that Oz--Oz
was okay--that we could trust him--"  I couldn't continue, I just let the sobs take over.</p>

<p>Xander pulled me away slightly, saying, "Look at me, Willow.  She knew.  She knew there
was something wrong with him.  Her spider-sense was ringing hard when he came back.  She
didn't know about his connection to Adam, but she knew that the wolf had taken over.  That
he had turned evil."  I couldn't believe my ears.  What Xander was saying made no sense.
But the passion in his voice convinced me that what he was saying was God's truth.</p>

<p>"But why would she let him back in the Scooby Gang?" I asked, managing to control my
crying a little.</p>

<p>"Because she wanted to keep an eye on him.  You know what they say, Wills.  Keep your
friends close, and your enemies closer.  She was too busy worrying about Adam and the
Initiative, she didn't want a loose werewolf to bite us all in the ass--so to speak," he added
when he realized his unintentional pun.</p>

<p>"But why didn't she tell me?" I asked.</p>

<p>Xander looked at me again, sadness in his eyes, and said, "I don't know, Willow.  Maybe
she thought that if you knew too much, Oz would get wise.  She was fighting a war on too
many fronts.  I guess Oz was one front too many.  And you had nothing to do with it.  You
didn't turn him evil, his curse did.  He stopped fighting it, and just gave in.  He embraced his
evil side."</p>

<p>"'And once you start down that dark path'," I finished, in my worst Yoda impersonation,
"'Forever will it dominate your destiny'." I started to giggle, which brought around a fit of
giggles from Xander.</p>

<p>"Yeah, something like that," he gulped.  We stood there, he comforting me, me allowing
myself to be comforted.  Goddess, it felt good to unload.</p>

<p>"You're the first person I've told this," I said to him.</p>

<p>"I guessed as much," he murmured.  "You've been carrying it around for far too long.  You
needed to unburden, and I'm glad I was there.  Now you can go on."</p>

<p>"How, Xander?" I asked as a new wave of tears threatened to take over.  "I can't remember
a time when I didn't love Buffy."</p>

<p>"So don't stop loving her," Xander said.  "Just stop blaming yourself.  She saved our lives
more often than we've eaten in restaurants, you know that?  Stay alive.  Remember her.
Hey, why do you think I became a cop?  Because Buffy showed me that there's something
worth fighting for.  Because she did what she did, and we were there to help her.  Now I'm
doing the same thing.  Helping others.  That's what matters."</p>

<p>Helping others.  Just like what I had said to her once.  Shortly before we graduated from high
school.  That's what I want to do. Fight evil, help people. I mean, I think it's worth
doing. And I don't think you do it because you have to. It's a good fight, Buffy, and I
want in.</p>

<p>"God, I feel like a selfish bitch," I laughed, mostly at myself.</p>

<p>He just held me, let me cry it out, until the maelstrom passed again.  For the first time in
nearly a year, I actually was able to smile, and mean it.  </p>

<p>"Thanks, Xander.  I really needed this."</p>

<p>"Any time, kiddo.  You want me to walk you home?"</p>

<p>"Can you walk me to Giles' first?" I asked.  "I owe a few people some major apologies."</p>

<p>"No problem," he answered as he gave me his arm.  "I told him and the others to hang tough
until I got back."  I smiled at him.  Always thinking of the basic stuff, while Buffy handled the
slaying and Tara and I dealt with the magic.  Same ol' Xander.</p>

<p>"You know what happened to me today, when I was first given my badge?" I just looked at
him as he spoke.  "Mom and Dad were there at the ceremony.  After I was given the badge,
Dad came up to me, shook my hand and said, 'You done good.  I'm proud of you.'  Just like
that."</p>

<p>"Your dad said that?" I was surprised.  I knew that Xander and his parents rarely spoke to
each other.</p>

<p>"Yeah, just like that," he answered, and I could tell that this new, tenuous bond between
Xander and his dad had affected him profoundly.  "I took this job because of Buffy, and now
my dad's proud of me.  How do you like that?  One year after she dies, and she's still looking
out for us."</p>

<p>I smiled more broadly, warmed by the thought.  Buffy, perched on a cloud, looking after her
friends still on Earth.  I started to think that no just and benevolent God or Goddess would
leave Buffy's soul in Hell, even if that's were she landed at first.  It made me feel good to think
of Buffy watching over me.  I looked up at the sky, and imagined seeing Buffy's face among
the stars.  For the first time in a long time, I wasn't dreading waking up in the morning.</p>

<p>I thought that I could finally get on with my life.  Thanks, Xander.  Thanks, Buffy.</p>

<p align=center>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>

<p>Xander and I walked slowly back to Giles.  I was revelling in the sense of peace that had
suffused me.  I hadn't felt like this since losing Buffy.  I really began to think that things would
work out for me.</p>

<p>We started playing 'Slug-Bug', seeing who could spot the most VW Beetles.  I threw Xander
off by announcing "Y2K Bug", when I saw one of those new Beetles.  We had a spirited
debate whether that counted, or whether the newer cars should be included with the older
models.  Slug-Bug was something that Xander and I did as kids, and playing it again with him
brought up so many good memories.</p>

<p>As we made sight of Giles' townhouse, we noticed a car that we didn't recognize in the
driveway.  When we got closer, I read the license plate; "QUEEN C2".</p>

<p>"Oh my dear lord", the rookie cop standing next to me whispered.  We knew only one
person who used that license plate.  Xander shuddered.  "Cordy?"</p>

<p>I hesitantly knocked at the door, and Giles answered.  "Willow," he greeted me.  "You and
Xander had better come in."  He ushered us inside rather brusquely.  As I entered his living
room, I noticed Cordelia sitting with the others, and Joyce sitting next to her.</p>

<p>Standing behind the couch, tall and stoic as I remember him, was Angel.</p>

<p>Angel and Buffy hadn't parted on the best of terms.  Shortly after Buffy and I first became
lovers, Faith had switched bodies with Buffy, and tried to take over her life(a situation that
still made my skin crawl at the thought of it; I had made passionate love with Buffy, only to
find out it was with Faith!  I had to live in the shower for a week!).  Shortly after getting her
body back, Buffy tracked Faith to LA, only to find that Angel had been protecting her.  Faith
had manipulated Angel into giving her sanctuary, and by the time her deception had been
discovered, the damage had been done.  Buffy looked at Angel, her first love, and saw only
an enemy.  Shortly after that was the final battle with Adam, and I don't remember seeing
Angel at her grave since then.  And now he was here, with Cordy and Joyce.</p>

<p>Buffy once said that there were two things that she didn't believe in; coincidences and
leprechauns.  After seeing Cordy, Angel and Joyce waiting for me at Giles', I decided right
then and there that I was never going to Ireland.  No telling who or what I would find there.</p>

<p>"Hello, Xander," I heard Cordy greet her old boyfriend.  "It's good to see you."</p>

<p>"Likewise, C," Xander answered, and I didn't feel any pretence in his civility.  His voice was
warm, his greeting genuine.</p>

<p>"Hello, Willow," Angel greeted me.  "It's been a long time."</p>

<p>"Too long," I said.  Whatever Buffy thought of him, I still had a soft spot for our favorite
Vampire-with-a-soul.  I went to where he was standing and hugged him.  I turned again to
Giles, and said, "I just wanted to apologize for wigging out back then.  I didn't mean any of
it..."</p>

<p>"I understand, Willow," Giles answered.  "But that may be academic, if what Angel has told
us is correct."</p>

<p>"Angel picked me up when he first got into town," Joyce explained to me.  "He just told us
why he's here." She stood up and looked directly into my eyes.  I could see recent tears on
her cheeks, but her eyes carried a glow of desperate hope.  "She's alive, Willow," she
whispered. "Buffy's alive!"</p>

<p>"Wha--" I could barely speak as I heard what Joyce was saying.  "How--" A thousand
thoughts and emotions collided within me.  I felt my knees shake, threaten to give way.
Angel sensed this, and directed me to the first available chair, which Cordy had promptly
vacated.  "How can that be?" I finally asked.  "I saw her.  I saw her die."</p>

<p>"No you didn't," explained Angel.  "You saw her fall into the Hellmouth, but she was alive
then.  If my sources are right, and I have to believe they are, then she's still alive, trapped in
the Hellmouth."</p>

<p>I was stunned.  At first, I couldn't absorb this information at once.  Buffy alive.  Buffy in Hell.
I heard myself whisper hoarsely at Angel, "So help me, if you're jerking my chain about this, I
will kill you."</p>

<p>"He's telling the truth," Cordelia rose to his defense.  "I saw her.  You know that I became a
seer after Doyle died.  I saw her in the Hellmouth, just the other day.  She was frozen, not
moving, but don't ask me how, I got the feeling that she was still alive."  She spoke haltingly,
as though her experience as a seer disturbed her.  She had told me that she didn't enjoy being
a seer, but it had come in handy for her and Angel in the past.</p>

<p>"Her vision had been so strong," Angel continued, "that I had to consult the Oracles.
Normally they're not exactly forthcoming with that kind of information, but they're exact
words told me what I needed to know; 'The living is among the dead, the Chosen One must
return'.  I have to believe that they're talking about Buffy."</p>

<p>I turned to Angel, and looked back around the room.  We were all trying to digest this news.
The others had heard it from Angel moments before I got back, but to Xander and myself, it
was new.  Xander's jaw was unhinged, and just hung there.  I guess that mine was the same
way.  "I need to be sure about this, Angel.  Can you be certain?  I mean 100 percent,
absolutely, hand over heart certain that this is what the Oracles meant?"</p>

<p>"As certain as I can be about anything they say," Angel replied.  "They're notorious for
withholding information, unless it suits their perpose to tell, or if it's urgent enough.  And if the
Oracles are telling me that Buffy has to be rescued, then I believe them."  He held out his
hand to me, saying, "I need you, Willow.  You and Giles are the only people I can trust to
find whatever spell or ritual or whatever it will take to bring her back."</p>

<p>"What about Wesley?" I asked.  "Isn't he on your payroll nowadays?"</p>

<p>"Wesley's good, but I need him to hold the fort back in LA," he answered.  "Especially with
Wolfram and Hart still giving me grief.  I need you.  Will you help me?"</p>

<p>I looked at him, trying to determine from his expression whether he was levelling with me.  I
finally decided that he wasn't kidding.  He'd never do that to me anyway.  Especially about
Buffy.</p>

<p>I took his hand in mine and said, "Like you even need to ask."  I looked at the assembled
Scoobs and others around the room and said three words, which were greeted by loud
agreement;</p>

<p>"Let's get Buffy!"</p>

<p align=center>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>

<p>Over the next week, I dove into every search engine, every web surfer, every resource I
could find to look for the key to the Hellmouth.  Giles buried himself in his ancient texts, aided
by Denise.  The others did what they could to help; Xander and Sandra patrolled the town in
their roles as cop and slayer, respectively.  Tara reminded me to eat at least once a day.
Cordy, Angel and Joyce provided whatever support they could.  It felt for a while like the old
Scooby Gang, like time passed backward to some day of great glory, when we were
younger, when we felt invincible.  Save the world, then party.  That was us, the Scooby
Gang, the Class Protectors, and we were back.</p>

<p>It was Tara that gave me the crucial clue; the source of the spell that we used to close the
Hellmouth in the first place.  I tore through that codex, rereading each passage until my eyes
grew blurry from either the ancient script or the eye-screwing Celtic spirals on every page.</p>

<p>Finally, the book surrendered its secrets to me.  I found what was called The Ritual of
Restoration.  I read and reread the passages until I committed them to memory, and then
assembled the extended Scooby Gang at Giles' place to outline the Ritual; </p>

<p>"Okay, gang," I started.  "According to the Cildargen Codex, the Ritual of Restoration will
allow us to bring a soul wrongly imprisoned in Hell to its rightful place.  Since it doesn't
specify Heaven,  I'm assuming that it will allow us to bring Buffy back.  I'll explain the ritual
first, then I'll field your questions.</p>

<p>"The ritual can take place only four times a year, on the first full moon following either the
Spring or Fall Equinox, or the Winter or Summer Solstice.  Fortunately, the Summer Solstice
was last week, and the first full moon following it is in four days.  The spell requires two
witches or mages to open the portal to Hell.  Tara, will you help me?"</p>

<p>"You got it," she answered.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Tara.  Now, the rest of you, Tara and I will be drawing on your psychic energies
during the casting of the spell.  I need you at that time to concentrate on Buffy, on her well
being, on any characteristic, fond memory, whatever.  It has to be positive, the spell can only
occur in a spirit of love and friendship.  Are we on the same page?"  The others nodded.  I
looked at Denise and Sandra, who were there with us.  "I'm not sure about the two of you,
since you never knew Buffy personally."</p>

<p>"That is true," Denise answered.  "But we had always admired her, and if we can help her,
we'd be glad to."</p>

<p>"Glad to have you on our side," I thanked them.  "Now, once the portal is opened, the ritual
calls for three of us to enter the portal, and retrieve Buffy.  Preferably three who are
especially close to her.  I don't think I gotta tell you that I'm going in."  I noticed Joyce
starting to raise her hand, but I stopped her.  "Sorry, Joyce, but only experienced Scoobs
need apply.  I'll need you topside to keep the portal open."</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," volunteered Angel.  "I've been there, I know the terrain."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Angel," I smiled at him.</p>

<p>"I'm not gonna be outdone by Deadboy, here," Xander announced.  "Count me in, too," I
could hear him add under his breath, "Did I just say that?"</p>

<p>"You sure, Xand?" I asked.  "This ain't just a grocery run to the Twenty Four Seven."</p>

<p>Xander turned around, answering, "Uh, yeah, I guess.  After what Buffy's done for us, it's the
least I could do.  Besides, after a patrol of Hell, walking a beat will be no problem."  I
noticed Cordelia smiling warmly at Xander, and Xander took her hand in his own.  I started
to wonder what was going on between them.</p>

<p>I continued.  "Okay, we have our posse.  Now, once we're in, we need the rest of you to
keep thinking good thoughts about Buffy.  This will be like a candle in the window.  It'll be
our beacon to find our way out of Hell again."</p>

<p>"One question, Willow," Joyce raised her hand tentatively.  "How will you find Buffy once
you're in?"  The others looked at her, clearly wondering the same thing.  "I mean, you'll be
passing through Hell, searching untold billions of souls for one soul.  Can anyone else say
'needle in a haystack'?"</p>

<p>"Good point, Joyce," I said.  "But you can always use an electro-magnet to pull the needle
out of the magnet."</p>

<p>"Too bad we don't have a Buffy Magnet," quipped Cordy.</p>

<p>"But we do," I answered simply.  I started to finger the Mizpah coin that I still wore around
my neck.  "Me.  That's why I gotta go in.  The key passages of the Ritual clearly state that
only a soulmate can find the lost soul.  Once we're in, according to the Codex, I must
concentrate on Buffy.  Once I empty my mind of all thought except for her, I'll get a clear
sense of where she is.  Once we find her, we'll send our thoughts out to you, and the portal
will open again.  That's why we need two mages.  One on each side of the portal to keep it
from closing for good once we're in."</p>

<p>I had finished explaining my plan, and awaited the questions.  There were a few, but mostly
they understood the plan.  "Guys, I won't lie to you," I finished.  "This is gonna get hairy.  I'm
talking serious world-threat level danger.  If we don't pull this off, the Hellmouth may take all
our souls, or split wide open."</p>

<p>"Wills," Xander commented, "I'd forget about your brilliant future in advertizing."</p>

<p>"Like I said," I continued, ignoring Xander's jibe, "This isn't an easy or safe route.  But it's the
only way to save Buffy, and if Angel's right, we're gonna need her soon.  This is entirely
voluntary.  You want out, there's the door, I won't think any less of you.  Anyone want out
now?"</p>

<p>Everyone shook their heads, or looked around.  Finally Giles said simply, "I think I speak for
all of us when I say, we're behind you all the way.  For Buffy."</p>

<p>The others murmured, "For Buffy."</p>

<p>My heart was lightened by their instant agreement.  I should have known better; they
wouldn't back out now or ever, not if they could save Buffy.</p>

<p>"Okay, gang, four days from now," I finished.  "Angel, Xander, I guess we're going to Hell."</p>

<p align=center><i>And we passed through the cavern of rats.<br>

<p align=center><i>--Harlan Ellison "I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream"</i></p>

<p>The next day, I began to prepare myself.</p>

<p>It had been over a year since I had attempted any kind of spell.  I
had abandoned the
practice of Wicca after Buffy's disappearance, blaming my inability in that
area for what had
happened to her.  Now I had to rededicate myself to the art, to save
her.  I spent the next
four days in silent meditation, cleansing my mind of all negative
thoughts.  I meditated
repeatedly on the Wiccan Rule;</p>

<p align=center>Bide the Wiccan Law ye must,<br>
In perfect love and perfect trust.<br>
Eight words the wiccan rede fulfill:<br>
An' ye harm none, do what ye will. <br>
What ye send forth comes back to thee<br>
So ever mind the law of three.<br>
Follow this with mind and heart,<br>
Merry ye meet, and merry ye part.</p>

<p align=center>Blessed Be.</p>

<p>Just saying these ancient words somehow made me feel at peace with
myself.  I knew that
this was right, that rededicating myself to the Goddess in this manner was
what I was meant
to do.  Tara and I had begun to memorize the elements of the Ritual of
Restoration, and what
I thought would be an uphill struggle turned out to be as natural as
breathing.  In my secret
heart, I felt that we would be successful.  That we would find and
save Buffy.</p>

<p>I needed that optimism to survive the days before we could complete the
ritual.  Angel had
told us before,  from his own experiences in Hell, that time passed
much more quickly in Hell
than on Earth.  He had been stranded in Hell for a few months, our
time, but it equated to
many years in Hell.  I hoped that he meant that symbolically, not
literally.  Buffy had been
gone for over a year, how much time had passed for her?  Buffy could
be ancient, old enough
to be my grandmother.  Or long dead.  Angel and I had talked
about it the night before the
ritual, and he could only say that the Powers That Be wanted her back on
earth for some
purpose.  At least he was led to believe that by the Oracles.  I
could only trust that Angel
was right.</p>

<p>For Buffy's sake, he had to be.</p>

<p align=center>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>

<p>The night of the full moon, we were as ready as we were gonna be.
</p>

<p>The site of the Ritual of Restoration was an abandoned graveyard.  The
former site of the
Initiative headquarters.  The site of our last battle against
Adam.  The site where we lost
Buffy.</p>

<p>And the only site where the Hellmouth could be safely opened, to allow us
to get Buffy back.</p>

<p>Xander, Cordy, Angel, Giles, Joyce, Denise and Sandra stood in a circle
around Tara and
myself as we began the ritual.  We required silence from the other
participants, and their
complete trust.  The spell could only work in an atmosphere of trust
and love.  No negative
emotions.</p>

<p>I had noticed something going on just before we started.  I looked at
Xander as he spoke
with Cordy.  I could hear them both clearly, and what they said made
me smile;</p>

<p>Xander started it, saying, "Well, Cordy, looks like I'm finally putting the
Zeppo to rest." This
comment, referring to Cordy's old opinion of him, made her sad to hear it
again. </p>

<p>She looked directly at him, and placed a hand on his shoulder.  "You
know, Xand," she
started, smiling for his benefit, "there's one thing about Zeppo that I
just remembered."</p>

<p>"And what was that?" he asked.  She didn't answer at first, she just
wrapped her arms
around his waist, and leaned in for a kiss.  After the kiss, she
lifted her face, stroked his hair,
and smiled at him, and this time the smile was genuine.</p>

<p>"In those old Marx Brothers movies," she whispered, "Zeppo always got the
girl."  She
kissed him again, quickly, and then said, "Come back alive, Xander.  I
always liked men in
uniform."  Xander smiled at Cordy, and anyone present could easily
guess that their old
passion had resurfaced.  I had to smile as I watched them.  Even
though Cordy and I hadn't
started as friends, that's what we became over time.  And I gotta say,
I always thought that
she made a better choice for Xander than Anya.  Of course, any woman
in the world would
have been a better choice than Anya.</p>

<p>Finally we were ready.  I called for silence as Tara and I began the
invocation with the
Charge of the Goddess;</p>

<p align=center>"Whenever ye have need of anything,<br>
Once in the month, and better to be when the moon is full,<br>
Then shall ye assemble in some secret place;<br>
To these I shall teach things that are yet unknown,<br>
And ye shall be free from all slavery.</p>

<p align=center>Keep pure your highest ideal.<br>
Strive ever toward it,<br>
Let nothing stop you nor turn you aside.</p>

<p align=center>Mine is the cup of the wine of life,<br>
And the cauldron of Cerridwen.<br>
I am the mother of all living <br>
And my blood is poured out on the earth.<br>
I am the beauty of the green earth,<br>
The white moon among the stars,<br>
And the mystery of the waters,<br>
And the desire in the heart of woman.</p>

<p align=center>Before my face let thine innermost divine self<br>
Be enfolded in the raptures of the infinite.<br>
Know the mystery, <br>
That if that which thou seekest thou findest not within thee,<br>
Thou wilt never find it without thee.</p>

<p align=center>For behold, I have been with thee from the beginning,<br>
And I await thee now.</p>

<p align=center>Blessed be."</p>

<p>I motioned for Angel and Xander to join us at the center of the
circle.  They each had to
recite one line of the spell, as each of us called for one of the four
ancient elements.</p>

<p>Facing east, I began it;</p>

<p align=center>"All hail the guardian of the Watchtower of the East,<br>
guardian of the air.<br>
Bless us with your grace this night,<br>
Aid us as we breach the portal to the realm of the unliving,<br>
To find the lost soul within!"</p>

<p>I felt a wind lift up and caress me as I performed the ritual.  A
power suffused me as I spoke
the words.  Yes, this was working.</p>

<p>Angel, facing south, continued;</p>

<p align=center>"All hail the guardian of the Watchtower of the South,<br>
guardian of fire.<br>
Bless us with your courage this night,<br>
Aid us as we breach the portal to the realm of the unliving,<br>
To find the lost soul within!"</p>

<p>The wind blew fiercer, and I could tell that the others felt it too.
Dark clouds formed on the
horizon, and the electric smell of an oncoming thunderstorm filled the
air.</p>

<p>It was Tara's turn;</p>

<p align=center>"All hail the guardian of the watchtower of the West, <br>
guardian of Water.<br>
Bless us with your wisdom this night,<br>
Aid us as we breach the portal to the realm of the unliving,<br>
To find the lost soul within!"</p>

<p>Lightning bracketed the skies.  We were unleashing powers I had never
controlled before.  I
started to feel fear, but I wasn't going to let it conquer me.  I
would see this through, no
matter the personal price.</p>

<p>Finally, Xander spoke;</p>

<p align=center>"All hail the guardian of the Watchtower of the North, <br>
guardian of Earth.<br>
Lend us your strength this night.<br>
Aid us as we breach the portal to the realm of the unliving,<br>
To find the lost soul within!"</p>

<p>A crash of thunder drowned out the invocation, but it was enough.</p>

<p>Finally, we spoke the final words in unison;</p>

<p align=center>Gods and Goddesses, we call to thee,<br>
In love and trust we call to thee.<br>
Open the mouth of Hell to us,<br>
That we may seek our friend,<br>
Our champion,<br>
Our defender,<br>
Our soulmate.<br>
We ask this in the name of all that is good,<br>
Of all that is sacred,<br>
Of all that is love,<br>
Of the love we bear our friend.<br>
So mote it be!</p>

<p>The Goddess heard the words, and acted on them.</p>

<p>A bolt of lightning speared the space between the four of us, and the
ground erupted below
our feet.  We managed to back away before being knocked off our feet,
and were able to
watch as our ritual had its desired effect.</p>

<p>A sinkhole formed at our feet, a vortex of unholy energies.  The hole
crackled with its power,
with its hunger.  As I stared into the abyss, a revelation came to me;
into this pit were cast the
souls of countless men and women, saints and sinners, martyrs and
madmen.  Into this pit
Buffy was cast by Oz.</p>

<p>And, quite possibly for the first time, three souls were about to enter it
willingly, expecting to
emerge unscathed.  </p>

<p>Well, too late to turn back, eh?  </p>

<p>Tara turned to me, and I could see the tears forming in her eyes.  She
was afraid for me, and
I understood that.  Hell, I was afraid for me.  But I think she
was afraid for herself as well.
She had confessed her attraction for me a few days ago, and was now
throwing away any
chance she had with me, to help bring back Buffy.  My heart ached for
her, and I wanted to
comfort her, however briefly I could, before I left.</p>

<p>I think she understood what I was thinking.  She just wrapped her arms
around me in a fierce
hug, and said, "Good luck, Willow."</p>

<p>"Keep a candle in the window for me,"  I answered.</p>

<p>"Extra flamey, right," Tara answered.  "Go already!" She tightened her
hug briefly and let go.
I smiled at her and thanked her.</p>

<p>"Okay, guys," I said to Xander and Angel.  "Last chance to back
out!"</p>

<p>"Now why would I do a dumb thing like that?" Xander asked.  "Besides,
I stay behind,
Cordy won't let me hear the end of it!"</p>

<p>"Let's do the deed, Willow," Angel added.</p>

<p>I nodded to my friends, and closed my eyes.  "On three, then!" I
shouted.  "One!"</p>

<p>I could feel Xander holding my left hand.</p>

<p>"Two!"</p>

<p>Angel took my right.</p>

<p>"THREE!"</p>

<p>And we jumped.</p>

<p align=center>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>

<p>How do you describe the indescribable?</p>

<p>How can I give you a clear picture of what I saw when I opened my eyes and
looked upon
the landscape of Hell?  Could anyone give a clear picture of
it?</p>

<p>If Salvador Dali, Hieronymus Bosch, H. R. Giger and Clive Barker were to
collaborate on a
single work of art, that would encapsulate the darkest regions of the human
soul, it would
look like a Batman comic book compared to what I saw inside the Hellmouth.
</p>

<p>We stood on a plateau, of shifting colors and textures.  There was no
fixed landscape, but
shifting vistas and perspectives.  We could only get a vague sense of
things, of distances.
And virtually everything in Hell was a world away from everything else,
while being next to it
as well.  I know, makes no sense, but it's the only way to describe
it.  Even the three
dimensions we take for granted in the 'real world' were arbitrary in this
realm.</p>

<p>"'We few, we happy few'," Angel intoned.  "'We band of brothers.
For whoever sheds his
blood with me this day shall be my brother'."  He turned to us and
said, "Shakespeare."</p>

<p>I nodded, thinking to myself of what this place reminded me of.
"'Half a league, half a league,
half a league onward'," I recited.  "'All in the valley of Death rode
the Six Hundred'.
Tennyson."</p>

<p>Xander looked at us, and looked back at a horizon on fire.  "'On the
whole, I'd rather be in
Philadelphia.'  W.C. Fields."  He grinned.  Trust Xander to
go for the jokes, even in Hell.</p>

<p>"So, Willow," Angel turned to me.  "It's your show.  Now
what?"</p>

<p>"Now, I concentrate," I said, fighting back the rising tide of fear that
threatened to undo me.
I held my Mizpah coin in my hand, hard enough to leave an impression on my
palm.  I closed
my eyes, shut out all the fear, all the uncertainty I was feeling, and
concentrated on Buffy.
Her eyes, her soft blond hair, her sweet smile.  Everything I loved
about her.  I felt a strange
feeling of peace, even in this unholy realm, as I brought her to the
forefront of my mind and
heart.</p>

<p>I opened my eyes, pointed, and said, "That way."  Suddenly a path
cleared itself before us, a
path into an unearthly wilderness.</p>

<p>"Okay," Xander announced.  "Since the other Five-hundred and
ninety-seven look like a no-
show, we'd better get this party started ourselves."</p>

<p>With that, we entered the Inferno.</p>

<p>We followed the path laid out before us, my sense of Buffy's presence being
our only guide.
Impenetrable woods flanked us on either side, and when I chanced a look
behind us, our
path was obscured by more wilderness.  I turned to Angel for guidance,
but he shook his
head sadly.</p>

<p>"I wish I could be more helpful, Willow," he explained.  "But this
doesn't resemble the Hell I
was trapped in.  I guess it's true, we each make our own
Hell."</p>

<p>"Any advice beyond that, Soul Boy?" Xander snapped at Angel.  Angel
just regarded him
with a
"you're-lucky-I-gotta-soul-because-otherwise-I'd-tear-your-heart-out"
look.  </p>

<p>"Just don't let anything spook you here," he said. "It's not real,
everything here is an
abstraction, taken from your greatest fears.  Nothing here is
real"</p>

<p>"And nothing to get up about, Strawberry Fields Forever!" Xander
added.</p>

<p>"Well you've been warned, Xander," I shuddered, "expect to see lots of
frogs."  Frog fear.
Still one of my main weaknesses.</p>

<p>"A horde of Anya-headed frogs," Xander said, giggling.</p>

<p>"With Cordy's temper," Angel chuckled.  Hearing Xander and Angel
banter back and forth, I
started to feel my fear abate.  Like whistling past the
graveyard.  I concentrated again on the
soul-signal I was getting from Buffy.  </p>

<p>Suddenly, the forest was gone, and we stood before an enormous
clearing.  Like a vast
desert, only without even a dune or sandbar to mark a landscape.  I
concentrated again.  I
felt her again.  Stronger than ever, like she was right there in front
of me.  But why couldn't I
see her?  "Buffy," I said aloud, "If you're anywhere here, please, let
me know.  Show me.
Come back to me."  The signal coalesced in my mind, and suddenly, I
knew.  "Straight
ahead," I announced.  As I spoke, a shaft of golden light appeared in
front of us.  </p>

<p>Angel looked dubious.  "Could be a trap."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," I said.  "She's here, I know it!"  I wasn't
as sure as I sounded, but I had to
say it.  To convince the others, and maybe to convince
myself.</p>

<p>We set out again, and the light stayed ahead of us.  I was reminded of
the Passover Story, of
how Moses led the children of Israel out of Egypt, and how God appeared
before them as a
pillar of flame at night and a pillar of smoke by day.  I didn't know
then what the light was,
but it comforted me to think of God, or the Goddess, sending us this
sign.  It sure as hell beat
the alternative.</p>

<p>Sure as hell.  Strange choice of words there, Wills, considering the
location.</p>

<p>As we moved forward, we heard noises, howls, cries, roars.  Of agony,
of unholy triumph, I
didn't know.  The light grew dimmer and dimmer, until it faded
entirely.  The flat landscape
we walked gave way again, this time to a narrow corridor, infinitely high,
six feet or so wide.
At either side were iron bars, like jail cells.  I took the risk of
looking into one of them, and
the sight chilled me to the marrow.</p>

<p>Oz.  In his wolf/human transitional form.  The form he was in
when he betrayed Buffy, when I
killed him in revenge.</p>

<p>Veruca, the werewolf who seduced him, who brought out his darkness, was
with him, her
human form fully submerged within the wolf.  The two werewolves just
glared at me, grinning
ferally.</p>

<p>I jumped back toward Angel and Xander, who turned to see what was giving me
the
wiggens.  Xander understood instantly; "Your greatest fears,
Wills.  Past enemies, vampires,
demons, other assorted nasties we've faced over the years."</p>

<p>"Not real, not real, not real, not real," I repeated to myself over and
over.  It didn't alleviate
the soul-chilling ice of Oz's eyes, entirely bereft of the good man who was
once Daniel
Ozbourne.  I turned away from them and just kept moving forward.
Always forward.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Xander jumped back, nearly bumping into me.  "I do believe
in spooks, I do
believe in spooks, I do, I do, I do, I do believe in spooks!" he
muttered.  Angel and I saw
instantly what startled him.  "Jack O'Toole," Angel recognized
him.  I nodded solemnly.  I
recall Xander telling us about him; while Buffy and I were concentrating on
a demon who
tried to open the Hellmouth, Xander tried to shake his insecurities by
buying a car.  He ended
up hanging with a zombie gang, led by Jack O'Toole, a sadistic zombie who
had his own
plans for Sunnydale.  Xander ended up saving the day for all of us,
and we didn't know about
it until later.</p>

<p>"Just move forward, Xand," I advised him.  "He isn't real.  None
of it's real."</p>

<p>"Okay, he's not real.  He's just a figment of my imagination.
Oh, no he's not."</p>

<p>"Hey, soulboy," a voice beckoned from the cells ahead.  A familiar
voice, one that chilled us
all.</p>

<p>Angel ran forward, toward the voice.  He stopped short, and gaped at
the speaker.</p>

<p>We blinked at the sight, and Xander asked, "Another Angel?"</p>

<p>"No," I corrected him.  "Not Angel.  Angelus."</p>

<p>The demon who wore Angel's face formed his lips into a jack-o-lantern
grin.  "Well, well,
well.  Don't you guys ever learn?"</p>

<p>"What, that you're just a figment of our imagination?  We've all seen
our greatest fears, the
monsters that keep us up at nights.  Mine just happens to be a piece
of me.  You think you
can scare me just by appearing at the wrong time and place?  News,
Angelus, it doesn't
work that way."</p>

<p>"I know that, friend," the demon laughed.  "I know also that you're
here to find your girlfriend.
Or is that ex-girlfriend?  That old happiness clause.  Doesn't
exactly make a great pickup line,
does it?  'Hey babe, want to raise some Hell, literally?'  I hear
she's batting for the other team
these days."  He regarded me the way a vulture regards a large carcass
in the middle of the
desert.  "Of course, you'd know more about that than I
do-uhng!"</p>

<p>Angel grabbed his evil self by the neck, saying, "Not another word.  I
remember what it was
like to be you, and I hated every moment of it.  Now, give me a reason
to let you live."</p>

<p>"How about 'you can't kill me', you putz!" Angelus spat back at him.
"I'm you, Soulboy.  I'm
a part of you that you can't get rid of.  You lose me, you lose
you.  I die, you die."</p>

<p>"Just tell us where she is, bastard!" Angel hissed through clenched
teeth.  He morphed into his
vamp face, snarling, "I won't ask again."</p>

<p>"Hey, hey, peace, peace," the demon chided.  "Don't get your delicates
in a bunch, oh mighty
anal-retentive one.  She's right here," he gestured toward the end of
the hallway.  "Go get
her."</p>

<p>We ran down the hallway, without even thinking whether we could trust
Angelus.  Or even if
it was really Angelus.  I saw Oz and Veruca, Xander saw Jack O'Tool,
Angel saw Angelus.
We all faced the monsters that hurt us the most.  If we had beaten
them by leaving them
behind, I didn't feel it.</p>

<p>After an eternity of running, I felt something.  The Buffy signal
again.  Stronger and stronger
as we ran.  Whatever that thing was, Angelus was honest with us at the
time.  Buffy was
there.</p>

<p>We finally found ourselves in a central plaza, like an arena.  Rows of
cells surrounded the
surreal prison yard, stacked twenty or thirty high.  I squinted my
eyes in the semi-darkness as
I tried to see anything beyond the prison bars.  A large crystal shard
suddenly erupted from
out of the center of the plaza. I ran toward the grisly grey shard, and
stood back,
thunderstruck at what I saw within the crystal.</p>

<p>Buffy.</p>

<p>In the exact same clothes she wore when she fought Adam that last
time.</p>

<p>Her face holding the exact same expression of shock I remembered from the
last time.</p>

<p>Her soul was embedded in that crystal.  She had been trapped inside
that shard from the
second she entered this infernal place.  In perfect suspension,
unchanging.  I couldn't even
sense that she was aware of her surroundings.</p>

<p>Xander and Angel caught up with me, and saw her within the shard.
"It's like she's--"
Xander tried to grasp what he was seeing.  "--frozen.  Like
suspended animation."</p>

<p>"Exactly what it is, Xander," Angel said.  "She's been like this for
God knows how long, no
awareness, no consciousness.  But I don't get it.  She's
responsible for the people in these
cells being here.  Why wouldn't they just torture her for
eternity?"</p>

<p>"Who the hell cares?" Xander shouted.  "Let's just get her out of
there!"</p>

<p>"Feel free to jump in with a suggestion on how to do that, Xander," I
said.  "There's got to be
a way to draw her out." I pondered this riddle for a few seconds, until I
grew aware of the
sounds of latches being unlatched, of bolts sliding out of doors, of giant
hinges swinging open.</p>

<p>"Oh, God," Angel exclaimed, as the monsters were freed from their
cells.  I caught sight of
their faces, their bodies; Vampires, demons, monsters.  The Fear God,
the Gentlemen, the
Master, Lothos, the Hansel and Gretel demon, Trick, Kakistos, Belial, Mayor
Wilkins, all
joined by Oz, Veruca, Jack O'Tool, and Angelus.  Nearly every foul
thing that Buffy had
faced over the course of her career as a Slayer.  All in one
place.</p>

<p>All glaring at the three of us.</p>

<p>"Oh, God," Angel repeated, "we were wrong.  They didn't bring her here
to torture her.
They brought her here to keep her from escaping.  To prevent her from
slaying any of their
brethren."</p>

<p>"And now that we're here," I guessed, gulping hard, "we tripped some kind
of silent alarm?"</p>

<p>"And they're all here," Xander added, visibly shaking, "to stop us from
getting her back.  Any
way they can."  We said nothing else.  There was nothing else to
say.  We could see it in that
instant.  We had failed to save Buffy.</p>

<p>Angelus, the ringleader of these monsters, stepped forward, arrogance
visible in every stride,
every look.  He stopped just short of Angel's face, and announced,
almost casually, "Well
boys and girls, let's get ready to rumble."</p>

<p>And the monsters moved forward.</p>
