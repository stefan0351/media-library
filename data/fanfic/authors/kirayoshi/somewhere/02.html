<p align=center><i>"I--<br>
I wish I could swim,<br>
Like dolphins--<br>
Like dolphins can swim.<br>
Though nothing <br>
Can keep us together,<br>
We can beat them, <br>
Forever and ever,<br>
We can be Heroes, <br>
Just for one day.</i></p>

<p align=center><i>--David  Bowie "Heroes"</i></p>

<p>The army of monsters surrounded us and began to close in, as we circled the
wagons around
the crystal that contained the body and soul of Buffy.  A seething
mass of the vilest evil that
ever plagued the Earth.  All sent to the bowels of Hell by Buffy
Summers and us, the Scooby
Gang.  And the only thing on their collective mind was our
destruction.</p>

<p>Yeah, you could say I was scared.</p>

<p>"Willow," I heard Xander say, as a vengeance demon glared directly at
him.  "I just wanted
to say now, seeing as how I'm probably not going to get a chance later,
that I'm sorry about
stealing your Happy Hairstyle Barbie doll in elementary school."</p>

<p>What he said to me almost didn't register.  I was already too bogged
down in my own
despair.  I had risked everything to save my beloved, and lost it
all.  Add to the cost of my
failure the lives of two of my best friends.  I wanted to scream "It's
not fair!" into the face of
Hell, but my heart was in my mouth.  I could sense Angel beside me,
ready to fight to the last.
Even Xander had abandoned his normal fears in order to take a final stand
against these
demons.  I felt proud of them, and at the same time, I knew that I
didn't deserve their
support.  I had failed them.  I had failed her.</p>

<p>And as I reached the deepest pit of self-pity, I sensed that light again,
the light that led me
here, to Buffy's side.  But it was different.  Not from anywhere,
not from a specific light
source, but from everywhere.  I gasped at its gentle radiance, as
realization hit me; the light
didn't come from anywhere, it came from me.  I was that light, and the
monsters were afraid
of it.</p>

<p>As I tried to grapple with this new development, I heard in my heart, my
soul, my mind, the
words from the Charge of the Goddess, which I had recited with Tara at the
beginning of this
rescue mission; </p>

<p align=center>"Know the mystery, <br>
That if that which thou seekest thou findest not within thee, <br>
Thou wilt never find it without thee."</p>

<p>Within thee.</p>

<p>Within myself.</p>

<p>At this point, I figured, Hell, what have I got to lose?</p>

<p>I started to ponder within myself.  Who I was.  Willow
Rosenberg.  Daughter of Ira and
Sheila Rosenberg.  Native of Sunnydale, California.  Jew.
Computer hacker.  Wiccan.
Spell-caster.  Scooby Gang member.  College student.  Code
writer.  Lover of Buffy
Summers.  Servant of the Goddess.</p>

<p>And suddenly, so much more.</p>

<p>My transformation didn't go unnoticed.  Angel suddenly gawked at me,
shouting,
Willow?  What happened to you?"</p>

<p>I smiled serenely, knowing without understanding how I knew that all would
be well.  "If
they're abstractions, Angel," I answered, feeling the energy coursing
through me, and
unleashing it into a fireball that burnt the first wave of monsters that
were on the verge of
attacking us, "then so are we!"  </p>

<p>And the light suffused me.</p>

<p>I knew, I felt, I was, more than I ever knew, felt and was before.
The power of every
goddess, every heroine of every myth, coursed through me.  Hera's
power coursed through
my veins.  Athena's wisdom shone from my brow.  Artemis's skill
guided my hands.
Aphrodite's passion burned in my loins.  Hestia's grace flowed from my
heart.  </p>

<p>I was Gaia, mother Earth, and Ishtar.  I was Lilith, the demon first
wife of Adam.  I was Eve,
his true wife and mother of all man.  I was both Guinivere, the
consort of Arthur, and
Morgaine Le Fay, his sister and lover.  Saint Brigid, Macha, and Grace
O'Malley, all these
legends and more, these were my names.  I was a Goddess among demons,
and these
demons dared to keep me from my beloved.</p>

<p>I almost felt sorry for them.</p>

<p>I rose, floated really, above the heads of the frightened monsters.  I
glared at them, and my
stare was steel.  "You have taken a soul that doesn't belong to you!"
I cried out to them.
"We've come to take it back.  Any questions?"</p>

<p>I belatedly noticed Xander and Angel standing below me.  Xander's eyes
were bugging out
of his head, and even Angel, who has witnessed over two centuries of
weirdness, stood
stock still.  "How--how did you--" I heard Xander stammer.</p>

<p>"You have to look within yourself, Xander," I answered, calm and
serene.  "We make our
own Hell, Angel said as much himself.  We control who we are
here.  Not them."</p>

<p>Angel regarded me with a knowing look, and took Xander's hand in his
own.  "I think I get it,
Willow.  Xander, follow my lead."  Angel closed his eyes, and
Xander did the same
reluctantly.  I lowered my body down, and held their free hands, to
speed the change.  I saw
them shudder violently as the power I knew coursed through them.
Angel shook his head,
and I started to see him differently.</p>

<p>Gone was the brooding, melancholy figure we had known for years.  In
his place stood an
amalgam of the great heroes of his native Ireland, and the United
Kingdom.  He was
Chuchulan, the legendary barbarian hero of Ireland.  He was Saint
Patrick, Ireland's patron.
He was Beowulf, slayer of the Grendel.  He was Arthur, king of the
Britons, as well as Sir
Lancelot and Galahad.  He was Robin of Locksley, better known as Robin
Hood.  He was
William Wallace, the Scots rebel known as "Braveheart".  He was Rob
Roy, the Highland
Rogue.  </p>

<p>His stance was bold, proud, mighty.  His sword(materialized at his
whim) glistened in the dim
light.  He was a warrior borne, and prepared to fight any horde of
demons.</p>

<p>I glanced back to Xander, and saw a similar transformation.  He had
worn a T-shirt and blue
jeans.  Now, he sported a leather bomber jacket, Ray-Bans, an enormous
gun in each hand,
and a wild look in his eyes that would have intimidated the Devil
himself.  I realized that he
drew from his own heroes and legends as we did, but while I chose the
goddesses and strong
women of myth, and Angel drew from the heroes of the British Isles, Xander
patterned his
inner self from more modern heroes.  </p>

<p>He was Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Harrison Ford, Samuel L.
Jackson, Lawrence
Fishburne, Jean-Claude Van Damme and even a little Jackie Chan thrown in
for good
measure.  He was taller, more massive in the upper body, more
powerfully built, more
confident.  I suddenly understood why her chose to join the police
force.  His inner self was,
because there was no other term for it, a crime-fighter.  A
superhero.  The Supercop!</p>

<p>"Okay, boys," I announced, "It's showtime!"  I conjured a staff, an
enormous diamond at its
head, and cast the light of my soul upon the creatures before us.  The
light burnt as it touched
their flesh, and they leapt back in agony.</p>

<p>"YEE-HAH!" Xander shouted, spraying a shower of bullets at the retreating
monsters.
"Welcome to the Matrix, baby!"</p>

<p>Angel said nothing, but jumped into the fray, slicing demons left and
right.  I had to smile as I
watched him work, cleanly and efficiently.  We suddenly had the
advantage, and we were
using it.</p>

<p>He had just destroyed two Gentlemen when a loud, familiar bellow could be
heard.  Xander
and I had recognized the shambling heap that emerged from the thinning
crowd of demons.
The patchwork body, the misshapen figure before us.  Adam.  The
last demon we ever
faced.  And the toughest.</p>

<p>"Impressive," he said, almost passively.  "But in the end,
futile.  The Slayer's soul is ours.
And soon, your souls will be ours as well."</p>

<p>"Guess again, Mix-n-Match!" Xander quipped.  He fired his automatic
guns, an infinite supply
of bullets in their clips, into the unholy beast's chest.  He just
shrugged them off.</p>

<p>"That's my boy," Angelus commented, stepping up next to Adam.  "Takes
more punishment
than Wile E Coyote.  You can't take him down, not here.  You've
followed Buffy here just to
join her, sweetcheeks."</p>

<p>"We're taking her with us," I said simply.  "You don't scare us
anymore, Angelus."</p>

<p>"Then I'll just have to destroy you.  And what better way to destroy
you than to take out your
heart?"  He started toward the crystal in which Buffy was entombed,
while Adam lurched
toward Xander.</p>

<p>Angel suddenly lunged toward his other half, standing between Angelus and
Buffy.  "You
want her, you have to go through me!"</p>

<p>"Whatever," Angelus said, as a sword appeared in his hand.  A big
sword, looked like a
sharpened crowbar.  He thrust at Angel, who countered his every
blow.  They fought like
demons, each determined to destroy the other.  Each one was equally
matched, but it was
only a matter of time before Angelus started fighting dirty.  And I
feared that Angel wouldn't
be ready for his betrayal.</p>

<p>"Willow," Xander shouted at me, as he wrestled with Adam.  "It's up to
you!  Whatever
power you're channeling, you're the only one who can free Buffy!"</p>

<p>"Wha--" I stammered.  I started to argue with him, to ask what he
meant, but the Goddess
power sang in me.  Something happened, something I can't quite
explain.</p>

<p>Last Halloween, we faced the Fear God, summoned accidentally during a frat
house's
Halloween party.  The Scooby gang were forced to face our greatest
fears, and our terrors
turned us against each other.  Buffy and I blew up that night, she
claiming that my magic was
about fifty-fifty in the reliability department, me taking offense at being
labeled the 'sidekick'.
What we said to each other had really shaken me.  I had to deal with
my own insecurities
over my magic.  I screwed up every once in a while, cast the wrong
spell, caused Buffy to fall
in love with Spike, that sort of thing.  And even now, I still feel
those fears.</p>

<p>But at that moment, clarity came to me.  Absolute clear focus, for the
first time in my life.
The Halloween party was long gone.  My fears, my insecurities, all
were forgotten.  I knew
what I had to do.</p>

<p>I erected a shield between the monsters and Buffy's crystal and
myself.  I didn't even try to
remember a specific spell, I just did it.  I knew it would work, the
Goddess power within me
assured me that it would work.  I faced the crystal, and saw her
within.  Her body, but also
her heart and soul beyond the physical form.  They were still intact
within her.  Scared,
disconnected, confused, but still there, and still as beautiful as I
remember.  </p>

<p>I closed my eyes, and reached out to her.  I held the Mizpah coin, my
talisman to her.  I
concentrated on that sensation, the call of her soul to mine.</p>

<p>Buffy?  Are you there?</p>

<p>I felt something, trying to reach me.  I started to relax
myself.  To feel, rather than think.  I felt
for her, like a lifeline.  She was my lifeline.  I had been
grasping for her, for my beloved, for
the last year.  It was now or never.</p>

<p>Buffy?  Buffy?  Come back to me!</p>

<p>There was something, some formless entity.  But it was familiar, warm,
safe, beautiful.</p>

<p>Buffy.</p>

<p>Buffy, I'm here.  It's me. Willow.  I've come back for
you.</p>

<p>The entity took a more defined shape.  It reacted to me.  I could
almost sense that it
recognized me.</p>

<p>Xander, Angel and I came back for you.  We're not leaving without you
this time.
We're bringing you back with us.</p>

<p>I touched the crystal, and it vibrated under my touch.  It felt
strange, like a warm electric
blanket, but with a pulse.  A heartbeat.</p>

<p>Wil--low?</p>

<p>I jolted when the voice echoed in my head.  I reached further,
tracking the source of the
voice.</p>

<p>Willow?</p>

<p>Buffy!  It's you!</p>

<p>Buf--fy?</p>

<p>Buffy!  Yes, Buffy!  It's me, Willow!</p>

<p>I could hear the monsters fighting on, the crash of sword against sword,
the breaking of
bones.  I blotted those sounds out of my field of concentration,
honing in on the voice of my
Buffy.</p>

<p>I glanced behind me.  Things weren't going well.  For all their
newfound strengths, Angel and
Xander were still fighting hard against their opponents.  Angelus and
Angel were almost
equally matched, and as I knew he would, Angelus started to fight more
savagely, more
aggressively.  He had Angel on the defensive, and I could tell that
Angel was tiring.</p>

<p>As for Xander, he was leaping out of Adam's reach, but Adam started to
adapt his fighting
style to compensate.  He started to attack Xander as he landed, and
Xander couldn't get out
of the way fast enough.  Soon, Adam had him in a hammerlock, and he
couldn't get loose.</p>

<p>I turned back to the crystal.  Okay, Buffy, it's showtime!
C'mon, I know you're in there.
You're missing a hell of a fight.  We need you out here,
Buffy!</p>

<p>N-no, Wills, I heard her answer in my mind.  I don't know how to get
out.</p>

<p>Just focus on me, Buffy, I answered desperately.  That's how I found
you.  I'm right here,
I'm not going anywhere.  I'm not going to lose you now.  I leaned
my head against the
crystal, and sent one thought, one hope, one prayer.</p>

<p>I love you, Buffy.</p>

<p>Silence.  Within myself, outside of myself.  Adam and Angelus
stopped their attacks on
Xander and Angel.  </p>

<p>A flaw started to form in the crystal's surface.  The crack spread
quickly, splitting across the
crystal, and a shaft of infinitely bright light poured out of the
crack.  Within seconds, the crack
encompassed the whole of the crystal, lengthwise, cleaving it into two
shards.  The shards fell
to the ground, and fragmented, without sound, only the light.  The
light filled the chamber,
blinding, piercing, penetrating everything and everyone within.  Adam,
Angelus, and the
others who stood as spectators, watching the battle, didn't even have time
to scream as their
bodies had simply disintegrated.</p>

<p>I dared to look directly at the light.  I saw a figure, standing above
us, the source of the light.
Angelic, terrifying, and at the same time, as familiar as home, and as
beautiful as the sunrise.
Long hair haloed a sweet, smiling face.  Her face.</p>

<p>I couldn't laugh, I couldn't cry, I could only shout out; "BUFFY!"  </p>

<p>
It was enough.  The angel that was my Buffy regarded me with a level
gaze, and then smiled
at me.  It was her smile, the one she wore whenever I served her
favorite ice cream, when
we laughed together watching "The Princess Bride", when she cradled me in
her arms after
lovemaking.  She opened her arms to me again, and I jumped in without
saying a word.
There was nothing to say.  No words were needed to express my joy, and
I don't think that
the words that could encapsulate the love I felt for Buffy even
exist.</p>

<p>A tiny corner of my mind echoed out to Tara and the others topside; We have
her.  Now.</p>

<p>Two seconds later, I felt suddenly heavy, and cold.  I glanced around
me, and realized that
we were out of the vortex.  Angel and Xander were standing beside me,
and the others were
gathering around us.  I saw Cordy throw herself at Xander, who caught
her in his arms.  I
kneeled on the ground, cradling a body in my arms.  I looked at the
body.  Buffy was
unconscious, her pulse was weak, her breathing was shallow.  But she
had a pulse, she was
breathing.  She was alive.</p>

<p>Joyce kneeled beside me, hope and fear fighting for control of her
face.  I looked straight at
her, not minding the tears that streamed out of my eyes.  I laughed
and cried together at once,
whispering hoarsely, "We got her!" </p>

<p>Giles stood next to us, and as I looked up at him, I could see the absolute
joy that radiated
from him.  The normally unflappable Englishman was beside himself with
relief, with joy that
Buffy was well.  "She looks pale, and her breathing's a bit shallow,"
I continued, lifting her
body up a little.  "We should get her to the hospital."</p>

<p>Angel lifted her body in his arms, and took her to Joyce's SUV.  I had
to follow them; I just
got her back, I wasn't leaving her now.  I climbed into the back of
the SUV as Angel placed
Buffy's body inside, treating her like a Faberge egg.  I sat beside
her, watching her sleep.  I
had to take her hand, to touch her, to feel her fingers with my own.
I had to feel her, to look
at her, to know that she was alive, with me again.  I whispered my
thanks to the Goddess for
allowing me to save Buffy Summers.  For reuniting us again.</p>

<p align=center><i>Pray God you can cope<br>
I stand outside,<br>
This woman's work<br>
This woman's world</i></p>

<p>At the hospital we all waited.  Giles sat with Joyce, Tara sat next to
Sandra, while Denise
stood fascinated by Angel.  Xander and Cordy arrived later, as they
stopped in the gift shop,
and when they arrived in the waiting room, the upper half of Xander's body
was lost within a
cloud of brightly colored Mylar balloons with "Get Well" slogans.</p>

<p align=center><i>Oh, it's hard on the man<br>
His part is over,<br>
Now starts the craft of the father.</i></p>

<p>I looked at Giles, knowing how hard he had taken Buffy's loss in the first
place.  Almost as
hard as I did.  He was her Watcher, her surrogate father, her
protector, and he felt that he
had failed her.  Now, he stood by helpless, as we waited for the
doctors to examine Buffy.  I
could tell that he was praying for Buffy.  Like we all were.</p>

<p align=center><i>I know you have a little life in you yet.<br>
I know you have a lot of strength left.</i></p>

<p>C'mon, Buffy.  You're stronger than anyone I've ever known.  Not
just physically, but in
spirit, in heart.  You taught me how to live, how to care, how to
love.  And I want to spend
the rest of my life showing how much I learned from you.  I want to
hold you, kiss you, dance
with you, cook for you, make love to you, sleep in your arms.</p>

<p align=center><i>I should be crying <br>
But I just can't let it show,<br>
I should be hoping <br>
But I can't stop thinking.<br>
All the things I should have said <br>
That I never said,<br>
All the things we should have done <br>
That we never did,<br>
All the things I should have given <br>
But I didn't,</i></p>

<p>One year.  We've lost a whole year of our lives together.  I
could complain that it's not fair,
but so much of life's not fair.  Besides, we got something so few
people get in life.  A second
chance.  I'm not going to blow it.  I've got you back, Buffy, I'm
not going to lose you now.</p>

<p align=center><i>Oh darling, make it go,<br>
Make it go away.<br>
Give me these moments back.<br>
Give them back to me.<br>
Give that little kiss.<br>
Give me your hand."</i></p>

<p><i>--Kate Bush "This Woman's Work"</i></p>

<p>A plump nurse emerged from the e.r. ward, and motioned to us.  "Are
you the ones waiting
for Miss Summers?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Joyce answered hesitantly.  "I'm her mother, Joyce
Summers."</p>

<p>The nurse smiled gently at us.  "Your daughter is resting, Ms.
Summers.  She's been
dehydrated, so we've got her on an I.V. drip, and we'd like to keep her
overnight for
observation, but there's nothing to be worried about.  She's slowly
gaining her appetite, and
Doctor Wiseman assures me that she's going to make a complete
recovery."</p>

<p>"EEEEYYES!" Xander shouted happily.  "Buffy Summers is in the
building!"  The nurse
gently reminded him to keep his voice down, but his exuberance was felt by
all of us.  </p>

<p>The nurse looked around, and asked, "Is there a Willow here?"</p>

<p>I shyly raised my hand.  "Me," I stammered.  "I'm
Willow."</p>

<p>"Miss Summers has asked to see you.  I can only let you in for a few
minutes, but she's rather
insistent."</p>

<p>"That's our Buffy," Cordy quipped.</p>

<p>"Can I see her now?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly," the nurse said happily.  I could feel my heart thud in my
chest.  The same heart I
couldn't feel at all a year ago, as I watched my soulmate fall into the
abyss. "But be advised.
Whatever she went through, she may have sustained some partial
amnesia."</p>

<p>I could feel Joyce's arms around me, as she whispered, "Tell her we love
her.  She'll
remember you."  I gave her a watery eyed smile in return and promised
to tell her.</p>

<p>I followed the nurse to a private room.  I saw Buffy, my Buffy, the
woman I loved more than
life itself, the woman I mourned, the woman I missed for so long, lying on
the bed, her eyes
half-watching Jay Leno.  I cleared my throat to get her
attention.  "Buffy?" I managed to get
out before the lump in my throat got too big.</p>

<p>She turned her head toward me, and the smile I missed for so long was more
dazzling, more
loving, more beautiful than I remember.  "Willow," she breathed. "Come
on over here."  She
patted the side of her bed with her hand.  "Set that beautiful butt of
yours over where I can
admire it more."</p>

<p>"You--you remember me?" I asked timidly as I approached the bed.</p>

<p>"Of course I remember you, Willow Rosenberg," she teased me. "My friend, my
roommate,
my love, my life."  She beckoned me with the faintest gestures of her
hand, with the clarity of
her eyes, with the slightest twitch of her perfect lips.</p>

<p>I sat down on the bed beside her, and she managed to lift herself up so
that we were level.
All the emotions that were warring within me, all the things I wanted to
say to her, all the
opportunities that I had to hold her and missed, all came out of me in one
second, and I
broke down and wept for joy.  Buffy held me in her arms, as I held
her.  I wanted the
connection to last forever.  For a moment, it felt like we were
outside of time, outside of the
world.  There was nothing and no one but us, and no place where I
wanted to be but where I
was now, with Buffy Summers in my arms.  I heard her whisper "I love
you, Wills," and my
heart sang.  This is what I was meant to be.  This is the person
in whom I had found
everything.  And I wasn't ever going to lose her again.</p>

<p>The real world intruded, in the form of an outlandishly happy Xander
bursting into the room,
his huge bouquet of balloons in his hand.  The others followed more
quietly.  I don't recall
what everyone said at the time, mostly cries of "Welcome Back," and "Great

didn't care what they said.  I gazed into the wondrous vistas of
Buffy's eyes, and she smiled
into mine.  </p>

them; Hell yeah!  I
had a miracle sitting right next to me, saying that she loved me.</p>

<p>A miracle named Buffy Summers.</p>
