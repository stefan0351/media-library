<p>Giles pulled up to the curb in front of his house, and he and his passengers filed out quickly.
Giles immediately rallied the troops; "Xander, take Anya to the basement, you know where I
keep my armory. Grab as many weapons as you can. Stakes, crossbows, swords, a good
armful each! We're hunting for bear!"</p>

<p>"You want me to grab some too?" Willow asked eagerly. She was more motivated than the
others to rescue Buffy, although she was certain that they didn't know why.</p>

<p>"No, Willow, I need to speak with you once we get inside," Giles answered.</p>

<p>The second that Giles opened the front door, his ears were assailed by his television speaker
blasting out; "FUN, FUN, FUN, IN THE SUN, SUN, SUN!"</p>

<p>"What the bloody hell is going on?" Giles had to shout to be heard over the din.</p>

<p>The razor-haired head of the defanged vampire Spike appeared over the top of Giles sofa.
"Hey, gov'ner!" he greeted loudly. "Just in time for 'Red Dwarf'! It's the one where Lister
meets his female counterpart..."</p>

<p>"What happened to your movie, Deadboy?" Xander asked Spike, suppressing a desire to
grab the nearest object that resembled a wooden stake and plunging the business end into his
heart.</p>

<p>"Ooh, 'Deadboy'!" Spike chided. "More of the legendary Xander wit. Or half of it!" Anya
had to nearly pull a flying tackle on her boyfriend to stop him from trying to gouge out the
vampire's eyes. "Wouldn't you know, they replaced 'Sixth Sense' with 'Stuart Little'! So I
thought I'd kick back here."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Spike," Giles shouted angrily, snatching the remote control from Spike's hand
and turning the television off, "for reminding me why I chose to remain in America!"</p>

<p>" 'Ere, now," Spike protested. "I'm a guest in this shack, you know!"</p>

<p>"And as such," Giles answered, his rage held in check by the most tenuous of leashes, "it is
long past time that you earn your keep! You can join Xander and Anya gathering weapons,
and then meet us by the car. We're attacking a concentration of vampires at the old
Sunnydale High School site." Giles turned his back on the vampire, and approached Willow.</p>

<p>"You're kidding, right?" Xander asked. "Man you picked a screwy time to develop a sense
of humor."</p>

<p>"Believe me, Xander," Giles said, the irritation in his voice becoming a palpable force. "In a
way it's all a sick joke. But at this point we need any warm body who can help us. Or in
Spike's case, a room-temperature body."</p>

<p>"Whoa, Steady on, mate!" Spike shouted at Giles. "Nobody tells William the Bloody what to
do, you hear me? I don't take orders from any effin' mortal ponces like yourselves! Got it?"</p>

<p>Spike didn't see the hand that grabbed the collar of his jacket, until he found himself pinned
like a chloroformed butterfly against the nearest wall. The look on Giles' face would have
intimidated a legion of demons. "Now you listen to me, 'mate'!" he spat out his venom at the
vampiric houseguest. "You are only tolerated here as long as you are useful to us. And if you
ever, EVER, use that tone of voice with me again, I shall chain you to the front porch, and let
you watch the sunrise! Do we have a meeting of the minds?" William Blood, aka William the
Bloody, aka Spike, tried to look away from Giles' eyes as they flashed fire at him. "DO
WE?"</p>

<p>"There was a time when I would have torn into your jugular for that little display, mate,"
Spike growled. His shoulders then sagged in defeat. "All right. What do you want from your
toybox?"</p>

<p>"Xander will show you what we require," Giles' voice returned to its normal quiet tone, but
the steel that edged his outburst was still there. Spike meekly followed Xander and Anya as
they quietly made their way toward the basement. Only Willow stayed behind, in part
because after watching Giles attack Spike, she was to scared to move.</p>

<p>"Uh, Giles," Willow started timidly, but Giles cut her off with a curt movement of his hand.</p>

<p>"I wish to apologize for that display, Willow," he said gently. "I guess that this situation with
Buffy and her future counterpart has got all of us on edge."</p>

<p>"Hey," Willow answered. "You hear that sound? That's the sound of no one disagreeing with
what you did. Spike had it coming for a long time. But you said that you wanted to speak
with me about something?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he muttered as he headed toward a small shelf. He reached behind an antique tome,
and produced a small metal box. "You remember our last confrontation with Quentin
Travers, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he made you use that muscle relaxant of Buffy, for that damned eighteenth birthday rite
of passage thingy."</p>

<p>"If you mean that exercise in barbarity they called a 'rite of passage', yes," Giles said bitterly.
"Possibly the lowest point of my life was when I had to betray Buffy. She was right to turn
her back on the Council. I only wish I had seen it before then." He shook his head, clearing
his mind of self-recrimination, and continued; "Since that fiasco, I had taken the liberty of
taking the compound that they had me give Buffy to a friend of mine, Lucas Small, a
pharmacist." He opened the box, revealing a large metal hypodermic needle. "He supplied
me with this antidote. If Quentin's after Buffy for deserting the Council, he'll no doubt use the
muscle relaxant on her. Perhaps even a stronger concentration." </p>

<p>Giles knew this to be true. He had not said anything before, because he didn't want to be
seen as fishing for undue sympathy, but when Quentin Travers gave him the formula to
administer to Buffy, he looked at the substance. It was of such a high concentration that it
would have probably stopped Buffy's heart permanently had Giles given her the dosage that
Quentin ordered. Unable(or simply too scared, he still wasn't sure) to go against the Council
openly, he chose to defy them covertly; he diluted the muscle relaxant with simple blood
plasma, reducing its potency. His first act of rebellion against his masters. Still, he couldn't
deny that he had betrayed the young woman who had become a foster daughter to him. He
could say that he was just following orders, but that excuse didn't fly with Nazi war criminals,
Why should it fly with him?</p>

<p>Willow, for her part, stood thunderstruck at what Giles was saying to her. The head of the
Council, whose stated purpose was to aid the Slayer in her fight against the forces of Hell,
sabotaging her efforts, poisoning her? She remembered how devastated Buffy was to learn
of Giles' involvement in her losing her Slayer strength. She silently swore to the Goddess that
if Quentin so much as breathed on Buffy, she would exact a terrible revenge.</p>

<p>"When we get to Sunnydale High," Giles continued, "you must find Buffy. That is your top
priority. Once you find her, give her the entire contents of this hypodermic. The syringe
contains a compound designed to stimulate the adrenal glands, and boost the metabolism to
burn out any and all toxins. Once it's administered, according to Lucas, the poisons will be
purged from Buffy's body within fifteen minutes. The only side effect is that she'll become
ravenously hungry about an hour after the chemical takes effect, as a result of her heightened
metabolism."</p>

<p>"So we'll have the traditional celebratory pizza party after we save the world," Willow
suggested.</p>

<p>Giles smiled. "My treat. One more thing; before she recovers fully, she'll be vulnerable.
You'll need to stand guard over her, and take on anything or anyone who would attack her."</p>

<p>"No worries, Giles," Willow answered, "I've got a defensive herbal spell I've been dying to
try out." She rolled up her right sleeve, revealing a small sachet strapped to her wrist. "Twice
blest herbs, simple ingredients, and a simple spell to activate it."</p>

<p>"You came prepared, Willow. I commend you." He turned his head toward her, and said
simply, "I think I'm beginning to understand how important Buffy is to you. I know that you
are in love with her. I want you to know that I will move Heaven and Hell to bring her back
safely.</p>

<p>"Geez, does everybody know about me and Buffy?" Willow lamented. "I didn't know I was
even in a closet, when suddenly I'm outed!"</p>

<p>Giles suppressed a chuckle at Willow's observations. He knew that Buffy was in good
hands. Now, and should she and Willow choose to pledge their love for each other. "She's
lucky to have you in her life, Willow. I used to fret that she shouldn't involve you in her fights,
but it seems I was wrong."</p>

<p>"It was my choice," Willow answered solemnly. She remembered last spring when Willow
amazed Buffy with her announcement that she was joining her at UC Sunnydale. Willow
would have been right at home in Harvard or Princeton, any ivy league school, but she chose
to fight along side Buffy. "It's a good fight," she had said to her friend, "I want in."</p>

<p>All Buffy could say after her vow was simply, "I kinda love you."</p>

<p><i>Believe me,</i> Willow thought now as she remembered, <i>for me, it's more than 'kinda'.</i></p>

<p>"We'd better get going," Giles said, breaking the moment of nostalgia. Giles called for
Xander and Anya, who, along with an obstinate Spike, had emerged from the basement,
each bearing a small arsenal of medieval weapons; spikes, crossbows, silver-tipped swords.
"We've got the party favors," Xander announced, "let's crash the party!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Willow," Anya said in surprisingly sympathetic tones. "We'll get your potential
orgasm-buddy back for you."</p>

<p>Willow gasped loudly at her turn of phrase. She stood aghast at the vengeance demon, then
shrieked, "Does anyone here not know that I'm in love with Buffy?"</p>

<p>Xander's face wore an expression of goofy surprise, as he paused for a second, and
answered, "Well, not now." Spike just smirked. Willow wished that she could turn invisible,
or intangible and seep through the floor beneath her.</p>

<p>"Well, enough of these happy thoughts, mates," Spike quipped in mock-cheerfulness. "
'Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more', and hopefully," he finished, staring
daggers at Giles, "we'll shut the walls up with our English dead!" He headed outside, toward
Giles' car.</p>

<p>As the others headed out, Xander was heard to say, "Oh, yeah, I'm feeling more confident
about this mission already!" Fittingly enough, no one answered.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy awoke slowly, and could not quite shake the veil of lethargy that seemed to steal the
function from her limbs. Unable to move more than her neck, she turned her head around to
gage her surroundings. She was dimly aware of the hard cold ground beneath her, of the
cooling night winds that brushed against her cheek, of the derisive laughing of unearthly
fiends. Her innate preternatural senses, what she sometimes called her "Spider Sense", was
buzzing in her skull like a hive of angry wasps, but she couldn't muster the strength to arise, to
stop whatever was happening.</p>

<p>"Our sleeping beauty awakens," a condescendingly proper British voice that she didn't
recognize at first, but knew didn't belong to Giles, intoned over her prone form. "Prop her
up, I doubt she has the energy to move herself." She felt rough hands grab her arms and
yank her upright. She tried to keep her head from lolling to the side, as her body had all the
structure of an old doggy chew toy. She managed to raise her head slightly, and look at the
speaker. Her blood ran cold, but she still couldn't fight back against whatever was sapping
her strength.</p>

<p>"Quen-Quentin..." she started, forcing back the fogginess that had been engulfing her mind.</p>

<p>"I'm pleased that you remember me," Quentin Travers nodded to the weakened Slayer. "Oh,
don't bother to get up. I've taken the liberty of dosing you with a stronger form of the muscle
relaxant that I had Giles use on you before. You won't be able to move your limbs for at
least several hours. Long enough for our business to be concluded."</p>

<p>The Slayer said nothing. She just tried to sit up straighter, but her body betrayed her and fell
forward, like an ancient Raggedy Ann doll. Her nose was gracelessly flattened against the
ground.</p>

<p>Quentin ignored the suffering Slayer, and turned to the other gentleman who stood beside
him. "I like her this way," the weasel-faced individual commented. "For once, she's not
talking back to me. If it weren't for the school board, I'd have never let her back in school.
She was a bad influence."</p>

<p>"I assure you, Mr. Snyder," Quentin said to his partner, "that she will trouble no one again.
The Watcher's Council knows how to deal with troublemakers." The two men turned their
backs on the helpless Buffy, who could only remain in the position in which she fell, since no
one had offered to sit her back up, and wonder what Quentin and the demon who had
assumed the form of Mr. Snyder were planning.</p>

<p>This exchange took place outside of the remains of the school building, in the school's old
football field. As Quentin and Snyder discussed their plans, they failed to notice a second
Slayer, a tired, ragged young woman with only one arm, lurking behind the bleachers. She
managed to tail Quentin's car to the field, and avoid any vampires(and there were many
present) to get to her location. She spied on the proceedings, and when she felt the coast
was clear, she pulled out a cell phone, and dialed.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Thanks, Buffy, we're on our way." Willow hung up the phone and told Giles, who was
concentrating on driving, "Alt-Buffy sneaked into the football field, and heard Quentin talking
to The Amazing Snyder-Man. She also saw Buffy, and from what she told me, they used the
muscle relaxant on her."</p>

<p>"Damn," Giles muttered under his breath. "Did she see what they were doing?"</p>

<p>"No, but she said that the vamps that were gathering around were keeping quiet. She thinks
that something big is happening."</p>

<p>"We'll find out soon enough," Giles answered. "There's the school, just to our left." </p>

<p>He passed the parking lot, looking for a space near the football field, only to find a large
number of jeeps, and at least one Humvee, all painted in camouflage colors. A squad of
soldiers was milling outside the schoolgrounds, all carrying large, rather exotic looking
weaponry. One black soldier motioned for Giles to pull over, and marched toward his car.
As Giles rolled down his window, the soldier said to him; "Sorry, folks, this is a restricted
area. I must ask you to vacate the premises."</p>

<p>"May I ask on whose authority this area is restricted?" an irritated Giles asked.</p>

<p>"By the authority of the Initiative," the man answered smartly. "I repeat, this is a restricted
area."</p>

<p>"Now look, Mr..."</p>

<p>"Sergeant Carter," he barked out, loudly emphasizing his rank.</p>

<p>"Fine, sergeant, we have business here. We are here to stave off an event that will have
severe repercussions on this city."</p>

<p>"The Initiative has this situation under control," Carter said loudly, "there is no reason for you
to remain here. If you do not return to your homes, I will be forced to bring you into
protective custody for your own safety."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sergeant, I thought that we were still in America!" Giles shouted, his patience
worn to the nub. Before he and the sergeant could continue their stand-off, the sergeant
found himself in a hammer-lock. Spike, who had surreptitiously slipped out of the car, had
managed to overpower Forrest. "I think the gentleman wants to get through, gov'ner!"</p>

<p>"Hostile 17!" Carter shouted. "Shock it!" A lance of electricity rushed through Spike's body,
augmented by the chip that the Initiative had implanted in his nervous system to control him.
Spike convulsed, releasing Carter and dropping nervelessly to the ground.</p>

<p>"Out of the car, all of you!" a commanding voice shouted. "Hands where I can see them."</p>

<p>Giles and the younger passengers slowly filed out of the Citroen, their hands above their
heads. The man giving the orders turned to them, and Willow gasped when she recognized
his face, and his wavy blond hair. "Riley?"</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Finn to you, Ma'am, he's the commanding officer of this mission," Carter stated.</p>

<p>"At ease, Carter," Riley interrupted. "I know her. Willow," he turned his attention to the
young hacker. "What the devil are you doing here? This place isn't safe. Intelligence
confirmed that it's crawling with vampires."</p>

<p>"That's what we're doing here," Willow answered. "Buffy's in there. Someone's holding her
hostage."</p>

<p>"Whoa, Buffy?" Riley shook his head. "What's she doing in there?"</p>

<p>"It's her job, Riley," Willow raised her voice. "She's the Slayer. You saw her take out the
Gentlemen, your intelligence people should have some idea what a Slayer is. We're her
posse, we help her slay undead stuff."</p>

<p>"Then what are you doing consorting with a known vampire?" Riley asked, his voice edged
with mistrust.</p>

<p>"Uh, can we call someone at home on that, Regis?" Xander chimed in, only to get Anya's
elbow hard in the ribcage.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about Pretentious-Boy here, he's on a tight leash. We're just making sure he
won't cause any more trouble."</p>

<p>"I don't know, Willow," Riley hedged. "I like you, and I know that Buffy thinks the world of
you, but you've put me in a tight spot. My superiors don't want civilians involved in--" Riley's
statement was cut short by sounds of battle. His troops were firing at a mob of vampires and
demons, holding their own but doing minimal permanent damage. Riley barked out orders to
his men; "Full power on the stun rifles. Fry 'em!"</p>

<p>"If you'll permit us," Giles offered, "we may be of assistance."</p>

<p>"Oh yeah?" Carter snapped at the retired librarian. "What can you do?"</p>

<p>"Well, how about--THIS!" In a single fluid motion, he allowed a small wooden stake to drop
out of his sleeve and into his right hand, and threw it like a dart into the chest of a vampire
that had risen from behind Carter. Carter turned around in time to see the hapless vampire
disintegrate into a small pile of ash.</p>

<p>"Bogey at one o'clock!" Xander shouted, ducking back into the car long enough to pull out a
crossbow. He quickly loaded a bolt onto the bowstring, cocked the weapon and fired. The
bolt flew into the heart of another undead fiend, dusting it instantly.</p>

<p>Two more vampires were converging upon Riley and the Scoobs. Willow raised her right
arm, revealing the herb packet she wore on her wrist, and shouted rapidly, "Henbane and
holly to guard my back, Garlic and rue to repel the attack!" An invisible force hammered into
the bodies of the two vampires, and several others behind them, knocking them flat on their
backs, and burning them as effectively as the sun. The remaining vampires retreated to the
field. Spike got back up on his feet, and asked Willow, "Not that I mind, missy, but why
didn't that spell dust me?"</p>

<p>"I guess that implant protected you, interfered with the spell, Willow answered nonchalantly.
"Consider yourself lucky." Spike pursed his lips, wondering at her coldness.</p>

<p>Riley looked around at the evidence of the vampire attack. "Rather old-fashioned weapons
you're packing, Giles."</p>

<p>"They're effective enough against vampires," Giles answered. "Sometimes the old ways
work."</p>

<p>"And how did you take the others out, Willow?" Riley scratched his head over that puzzle.</p>

<p>"I'm a witch," Willow stated simply. "Wicca, to be exact."</p>

<p>"So, you just cast a spell and poof, no more vampires?" he countered skeptically.</p>

<p>"Pretty much, yeah."</p>

<p>Riley stood silent, considering his options. "You'll forgive me if I'm a little suspicious. I'm a
scientist by nature; I don't accept magic that readily."</p>

<p>"Arthur C. Clarke once said," Giles offered calmly, "that any sufficiently advanced science is
indistinguishable from magic."</p>

<p>"And there are more things in heaven and earth, right Horatio?" Riley thought further, then
said, "You seem to know more about what's going on here than we do. Would you care to
tell us more about it later?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Giles smiled at Riley. "For now, you have weaponry, we have information, I say
that we put our mutual animosity aside and pool our resources."</p>

<p>At length, Riley turned to Carter. "I'm going to take a chance and trust these people." Carter
started to protest, but Riley cut him off; "Go gather the troops, we'll be going in on my mark.
Dismissed." Carter saluted his superior officer, and left. Riley then asked Giles, "Okay,
friend, what do you suggest?"</p>

<p>"The two men behind this concentration of vampires are Quentin Travers and a demon called
Belial. Belial will be assuming the identity of a human named Snyder. In all likelihood, they
have Buffy with them, drugged and helpless. They have something major planned. While we
take on the vampires inside, I will confront Quentin. We have a history together, and I feel
that I should confront him first. Meanwhile, Willow will find Buffy and administer the anti-
toxin. Buffy should recover within fifteen minutes of receiving it."</p>

<p>"And then what?"</p>

<p>Xander answered for Giles; "Then she kicks butt, we save the day, then we all go home,
scarf lots of pizza and watch Jet Li movies."</p>

<p>Riley regarded Xander with a smirk. "You seem to have faith in Buffy."</p>

<p>"Hey," Willow answered. "She's saved the world three times now. You?"</p>

<p>Riley half-smiled at Willow. He then turned to his men, and shouted, "We're moving in, men.
Let's do the deed!" The forces of the Initiative marched toward the wreckage of Sunnydale
High to face the monsters within.</p>

<p>"What about that?" Riley asked, pointing his head to indicate Spike.</p>

<p>"He gets a sword and some stakes, that's it," Giles said as he passed weapons around to the
others. "I don't trust him with a ranged weapon like a crossbow." To the Slayerettes, he
added, "The first sign of betrayal from our peroxide poster child, you know what to do."</p>

<p>"Got it, he's a pincushion," Xander said. Willow and Anya nodded in silent accord.</p>

<p>"All right, people," Giles announced, crossbow in hand, a bandoleer of stakes over his
shoulder. "Let's move in!" </p>

<p>And the battle was joined.</p>

<p>Buffy lay ten yards away from the two men, ignored as an inconsequence.  As she listened to
them, she knew that she was getting weaker.  It was all that she could do to keep her eyes
from shutting, to keep her ears attuned to the conversation between Quentin Travers and
Roland Snyder.  She feared that should she close her eyes, they would never open in this life
again.  Whatever Quentin pumped into her veins, it was far stronger than the stuff Giles gave
her on her eighteenth birthday.  The part of her brain that could function coherently was
growing more and more quiet, and her respiration became more shallow with each breath.  </p>

<p>She knew that she was dying, and despaired that there was nothing she could do to stave it
off, or to stop these evil men from their mad design.  The more she heard of their plan, the
more she raged with desire to stop them.  But her body would not respond to that desire.
She was trapped in a prison of useless dying flesh.</p>

<p>The sounds of energy weapons and screaming vampires interrupted Quentin's business with
Snyder.  "It seems we have company," Snyder commented.</p>

<p>"No one ever accused you of being an original conversationalist," Quentin replied.  "Don't
worry, Snyder, our troops will take care of them.  Now, shall we get on with business?"</p>

<p>"Of course," Snyder smiled, a feral display of teeth.  "Our negotiations have reached their
final stages, the...persons...I represent have agreed to abide by the stipulations of the
contract.  However, we require possession of the disputed territory within the next twenty-
four hours."</p>

<p>"This doesn't give the residents of the disputed area time to evacuate," Quentin argued.
Snyder simply laughed at Quentin's observation.</p>

<p>"Mr. Travers, evacuation was never an option.  The residents are part of the disputed area,
and must therefore be considered part of the trade.  With the signing of this contract, the city
of Sunnydale and all its population become property of the Hellmouth."</p>

<p>"I understand your position, Mr. Snyder," Quentin sighed, "but there are those among my
organization who would find this clause in the contract unacceptable.  There could be
reprecussions."</p>

<p>"Quentin, old bean," Snyder grinned like Satan's spin doctor, "you do understand what we
hope to accomplish, do you?  We are on the verge of forging the first peace accord between
humanity and demonkind.  This treaty between Earth and the Hellmouth will forever assure
the peace for your world.  You can no longer rely on your highly vaunted Slayers, Miss
Summers and Mr. Giles have guaranteed that.  This measure is required for humanity to
survive.  If a few thousand souls must sacrifice themselves to save a few billion, then, well,
you know what they say about making an omelet.  You have to break a couple of eggs."

Quentin lowered his shoulders, swayed by Snyder's logic.  "I suppose you're right.  As long
as I have your assurances that the demons of Hellmouth, once they take over Sunnydale,
won't cross over the boundary lines to invade the rest of the world."</p>

<p>"You have my word," Snyder lied.  The two men shook hands.</p>

<p>From her vantage point behind the bleachers, Alt-Buffy seethed, her disbelief at what she had
witnessed; Quentin Travers just sold out the human race to Belial.  She made a silent vow at
that very instant, that before she completed her mission to undo what Quentin and Snyder
were doing, she would kill Quentin with her bare hands.  As far as she was concerned, he
had proven himself more evil than any vampire, any demon, any monster she had faced
before.  </p>

<p>Master?  Yeah, right.  </p>

<p>Angelus?  Amateur!  </p>

<p>At least those creatures didn't have the burden of souls.  Quentin Travers didn't have that
excuse.  He had a soul and chose to sell it to the devil.  He could go to hell as far as she was
concerned.</p>

<p>And she would send him there herself.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Team one, forward!  Team two, ground support!"  Riley shouted to his men, who
responded with both professionalism and gusto.  A khaki swarm poured into the football
field, as the Initiative soldiers sought out and targeted their undead prey.  A number of
vampires broke through Initiative lines, only to be felled either by their energy weapons or by
the stakes and crossbows wielded by Giles and the Slayerettes.  They advanced toward the
center of the field, toward where two older men were talking.  Giles recognized them as
Snyder and Travers.</p>

<p>"Look!" Willow shouted excitedly, pointing toward the two men.  "Just past Snydeman!"</p>

<p>Giles, having dispatched a clumsy newbie vampire, craned his neck to see where Willow was
pointing.  Ten yards behind where Snyder and Travers were standing, a body slumped over
on her side, seemingly unconscious.  "Buffy," Giles whispered.  "Willow, quickly, get to her
and give her the anti-toxin.  Xander, Anya, Spike, cover her!"</p>

<p>"On it, Fearless Leader!" Xander shouted, his customary fear of nasty situations forgotten by
his concern for Buffy.  Willow sprinted toward her fallen friend, only to have a pair of
especially disreputable looking vampires cut her off.  </p>

<p>"Well, ain't that sweet," the female vamp, her tattered leather clothes barely concealing her
decaying body.  </p>

<p>"Looks like fresh meat," her male counterpart added.</p>

<p>"Geez," Willow teased, her right arm raised, to release the herbal spell.  "What are you, the
vampiric answer to Team Rocket?"</p>

<p>Xander knew a cue when he heard one.  "If that's the case," he quipped, "I choose you,
Crossbow!"  He promtly fired two bolts in rapid succession.  They hit their targets with
deadly accuracy.  Two more piles of dust were kicked aside by Willow's feet as she ran
toward Buffy.
Xander simply stood back with his crossbow in hand, saying to Anya, "Gotta slay 'em all!"
Willow silently gave Xander a raised eyebrow and a withering stare, recognized by all the
Scooby Gang as meaning, Man, Xander, are you ever dumb!, then headed back to where
she had seen Buffy.  </p>

<hr width=100>

<p>After quietly felling a demon who had snuck up on Xander and Anya, Spike stood beside
them, his sword resting casualy in his hand, strangely evoking the image of William Wallace,
or at least Mel Gibson in that role in 'Braveheart'.  "Nice slayage, Deadboy," Xander
quipped, and the former William Blood smirked at the left-handed compliment.</p>

<p>He managed to peg two other vampires that had threatened himself and the others.  With
each blow against his former bretheren, he came closer to the realization that he could never
go back to being the man whom he was, even if he could ever shake the effects of the
microchip that kept him from harming humans.  </p>

<p>He had little choice in the matter, but when push came to shove, he chose which side he
would be on in the eternal battle.  It wasn't a matter of humanity, for he still had no soul.
More a matter of enlightened self-interest; having turned against his own kind, he knew that
they would declare him enemy.  So it was only fitting that he declare himself their enemy in
deed as well as by perception.  And if that meant that I would be forced to join Buffy's
merry marching society, he thought at that time, then, Scooby-bloody-Doobie-Doo!  He
turned his mind away from thoughts of the future, instead thinking only of the present, and the
fight at hand.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>As it turned out, Willow didn't need the cover fire from Xander and the Initiative, since her
herbal spell was still protecting her.  She didn't even notice three vampires who had tried to
block her way to Buffy.  They jerked back from her as though she had erected an invisible
force field around her, just like Susan Richards of the Fantastic Four.  At least I can use this
spell to protect Buffy.  Oh Goddess, grant that I'm not too late!</p>

<p>After running for what seemed to her like an eternity, she finally made it to the fallen Slayer's
side.  Thankfully, neither Quentin, Snyder, nor any of their hench-monsters seemed to notice
her slipping through their defenses, as she concentrated on Buffy's condition.  Buffy's eyes
were closed, her lips parted, her skin pale and ashen.  Willow fought down her panic reflex
as she placed her finger on her friend's carotid artery.  The pulse was weak, thready, but still
there.  After breathing a sigh of relief and offering a silent prayer of thanks to the Goddess for
saving the one she loved, Willow immediately got to work.</p>

<p>She opened the packet of herbs at one corner, and sprinkled them out in a circle, around
herself and Buffy.  She muttered the invocation, modified for her purpose; "Henbane and
holly to guard our backs, Garlic and rue to repel all attacks."  The utterance would activate
the defense spell, and allow her to work undisturbed.  She opened the wooden case, and
primed the syringe, pointing it upwards and pressing against the plunger to squirt out any air
bubbles.  She then gingerly pressed the needle into the lower basalic vein in Buffy's right arm.
As the needle first made contact with the skin, Buffy's eyes fluttered open.  "N-no, no," she
murmered, "no..more...ne-needles..."</p>

<p>"Shh," Willow soothed her friend in a delicate.  "Don't try to move.  I'm not hurting you,
Buffy, I'm giving you an antitoxin.  Giles gave me this, it'll burn out the bad stuff that Quentin
gave you."  Buffy tried to squirm, but could only put up token resistance.  Willow carefully
found the vein, pressed the needle into her arm, and injected its contents.  "There now,
Buffy," Willow soothed, placing the Slayer's head on her lap. "That wasn't so bad now, was
it?"</p>

<p>"C-can I...have..a...a..lo-lollypop?"  Buffy asked, her voice barely audible. </p>

<p>Willow just smiled at her beloved, and stroked her blonde hair.  "Now you just lie back for a
few minutes, let the antitoxin work.  Don't worry, your Willow is here for you."  She placed
her hand in Buffy's, who squeezed her hand lightly, but with growing firmness.  Willow
smiled, relieved that the antitoxin was working.</p>

<p>Outside of the protective circle, the battle raged.  The Intitiative's soldiers clashed with the
vampires, and both sides drew heavy casualities.  Buffy, hearing the din of battle, tried to
stand up, to join the fray, but her center of gravity suddenly seemed to shift to somewhere
above her neck, and she collapsed quickly.  "No," Willow tried to take her arms, to get her
to sit for a few more minutes.   Buffy despaired as she tried to move with limited success.  "I
have to get in there," she lamented.  "I need to find Giles, to tell him..."</p>

<p>"Hush, Buff," Willow consouled her.  "Giles is out there, he knows what Quentin and Snydely
are up to.  You'll be up to full strength in a few minutes, and we'll be safe inside the protective
circle."  She took Buffy's hand in her own again and whispered, "I'm not about to lose you
again, do you hear me Buffy?  You're too important to the world.  To me."  She closed her
eyes, knowing that with her next sentence, nothing was going to be the same.  "I love you,
Buffy Summers.  More than anything or anyone else in this world.  Always have.  Always
will."</p>

<p>Her declaration, her vow, was greeted with silence.  For five seconds, each one dragging on
for what seemed like an eternity, Willow was convinced that she had gone too far, that she
had crossed a line from which she could never go back, that she had jeopardized her
friendship with Buffy forever.  She kept her eyes closed, afraid to face Buffy.  Then, she
heard Buffy speak, an edge of laughter in her voice;  "Damn.  I wanted to be the first to say
it."</p>

<p>Willow's eyes snapped open, revealing to her the face of her beloved, her Buffy, smiling at
her.  She tried to think of something to say, to make sure that Buffy meant what she said, and
then felt a hand gently but firmly grasp the back of her neck and draw her closer, and a pair
of warm clinging lips press against her own.  </p>

<p>Buffy's lips were sweeter and softer than she had imagined, and the thrill of kissing her sent
electric jolts throughout her nervous system.  It took her a second to recover from the shock,
and start kissing her back.  For a timeless instant, Buffy Summers and Willow Rosenburg
were the only two people in existence.  No Sunnydale, no Hellmouth, no vampires, no
demons, no Quentin, no Initiative, no...</p>

<p>"Mhi-mhey!"  Buffy mumbled against Willow's mouth.</p>

<p>"What?"  Willow broke off the kiss reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Riley," Buffy repeated herself.  Willow turned around, to find Riley Finn staring directly at
them.  Oh God, Willow thought, I feel a babble attack coming on...</p>

<p>"Buffy?" he asked.  "Are you all right?"</p>

<p>"Right as rain," she answered quickly.  Willow just waved at the hapless Lieutenant, clamping
down hard on her mouth to keep the babble dam from bursting.</p>

<p>"Good," he answered simply, although both women could clearly see the disappointment in
his eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Riley," was all that Buffy could say.</p>

<p>"Hey, it's okay." He gave her a half-smile, and said to Willow, "You take good care of her,
or I'll beat you to death with a shovel."  Riley tipped his right hand toward the two in a casual
salute, and turned around, barking orders to his men;  "All right, men, let's finish what we
started!"  </p>

<p>Willow looked back at Buffy, saying, "Hey, I'm sorry about..."</p>

<p>"Don't be, Wills," Buffy soothed her friend, as she struggled to get to her feet, and became
relieved to find that her legs would support the weight.  "This is what I want.  I'm the one who
initiated the kiss, remember?"  She suddenly regarded Willow with a tooth-bearing grin.
"And once this is all over, I plan on kissing you again.  Repeatedly.  And probably a lot more
than that."</p>

<p>"Talk about incentive for world saveage!" Willow answered back with what could only be
described as a shit-eating grin.</p>

<p>Buffy returned that grin with one of her own, sighing, "I do love you, Willow Rosenburg."
She then stopped, the smile vanishing from her face.  "We gotta find Giles.  It's worse than he
knows.  Quentin's signing a deal with Sny- uh, Belial!  He's going to hand Sunnydale over to
the Hellmouth!"</p>

<p>"And you, Slayer," the quietly evil voice of Quentin Travers replied from out of nowhere, "will
not interfere with these proceedings.  Buffy and Willow turned around to face Quentin, who
held a small handgun aimed directly at Buffy's heart.  "I had hoped to let you die in peace,
without pain or bloodshed, but since you insist on being difficult..." Without another word, he
pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The bullet ricocheted off of the protective field in front of the two young women, and back
toward Quentin, lodging in his arm.  Buffy looked at Willow and said, "That is one user-
friendly spell you got there."</p>

<p>"I don't know my own strength!" Willow breathed, awed by the power of her own spell.
"That one's definitely a keeper."</p>

<p>"I'll just relieve you of that, if you don't mind!"  Giles, suddenly standing in front of Quentin,
grabbed his neck in a hammerlock, and wrested the gun from his hand.  Buffy had never seen
Giles this angry before, not at her when she had lied about Angel being alive, not at Angelus
when he killed Jenny Calendar, not even at Snyder for any number of reasons.  There was a
flash of white fire in his eyes, and she swore she could see sparks flaring out of his mouth as
he ground his teeth.  "And now, traitor," Giles snarled, throwing Quentin to the ground, "I
would have words with you!"</p>

<p>"You are persona non gratia among the Council, Giles," Quentin puffed himself like a penguin,
as though being bodily assaulted had done nothing to his composure.  "You have no authority
in these proceedings."</p>

<p>"What authority do you have," Giles shouted indignantly, "to make such a deal with Roland
Snyder?  You are talking about sacrificing tens of thousands of people to the Hellmouth!"</p>

<p>"Why, Giles," Snyder suddenly stepped forward from his observation perch, oozing mock
civility.  "What an unexpected surprise.  You and Miss Summers, and her little witch friend,"
he grinned evilly at Buffy, who held Willow a little tighter, a little more protectively.  "I
suppose that Xander Harris is here as well?  How delightful, I get to see the four who caused
me so much grief over the years die at the hands of my associates."</p>

<p>"This is not about revenge, Mr. Snyder," Quentin glared at the former principal.  Apparantly,
he hated the man as much as Giles and Buffy did.  "Giles, what I am doing here is
safeguarding the lives of over five billion humans.  I have met with Mr. Snyder, who has
represented the denizens of what you euphemistically call 'the Hellmouth', and together, we
have forged the first treaty between humanity and demonkind.  Sunnydale will be sacrficed to
the Hellmouth, and yes that is a tragedy, but that is the price that we were forced to pay
because of you, Buffy Summers."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, no," Buffy flared, her rage slowly matching that she saw in Giles.  "You try to pin
this one on me, I'll filet you!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, Miss Summers, it is that attitude," Quentin continued, "that has forced the Watcher's
Council to accept this non-aggression pact with the Hellmouth.  You and your fellow slayer
Faith have proven unreliable, therefore we require a peaceful solution."</p>

<p>"Peaceful solution?" Giles sputtererd.  "You honestly think that you can deal with that--that--
creature?"</p>

<p>"Sticks and stones, Giles," Snyder tut-tutted.</p>

<p>"You're a greater fool than Neville Chamberlain," Giles continued his tirade, ignoring the
demon in barely-human form, "when he signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany!
He called it 'Peace in our time', then shortly after began the Blitz!  You think you'll fare better
dealing with demons?"</p>

<p>"If you had kept a tighter rein on your charges, none of this would have happened."  Quentin
then turned to Buffy, damning her with his eyes.  "Your rebelious nature has made you a
liability, I'm afraid.  You have constantly defied our orders, flaunted your association with
your so-called 'Slayerettes'--"</p>

<p>"We prefer 'Scooby Gang'," Xander chimed in.  The horde of vampires had thinned out
considerably, and the Initiative was eliminating the last few of them, so Xander and Anya had
joined the debate at the center of the football field.</p>

<p>"Besides, we wanted in," Willow defended the gang.  "Buffy's our friend, we watch her
back."</p>

<p>"My point exactly," Quentin growled.  "The Slayer is a solitary person, she must go alone
through her life--"</p>

<p>"Blah, blabity blah, I'm so stuffy, get me a scone!" Giles interrupted, shouting a line Buffy had
used on him when he delivered a similar speech years ago.  Buffy, remembering that incident,
had to laugh out loud as she heard those words coming from Giles lips.  In his own way,
Giles was saying that Buffy was right all along.  And he had heard enough of this fool
Quentin, he was going to give him a piece of his mind.  The Ripper is back, Giles thought,
taking names.</p>

<p>"Has it ever occured to you, Quentin," Giles continued,  "that Buffy is the most successful
Slayer in the long recorded history of the Watcher's Council?  That she is so successful, not
in spite of her defying our ancient, archaic traditions, but because she defies them?  And that
is why you wish to eliminate her?  Because she's her own person?  Nice plan you have here,
eliminate Buffy, and Faith while you're at it, she'll be killed while she's in a coma, and destroy
an entire town to cover up the evidence?  And then two new slayers will emerge to replace
Buffy and Faith, and hopefully be more pliant to the Council's wishes?  I will never believe
that the Council would ever approve such a monstrosity!"</p>

<p>"None the less, Giles," Quentin said quietly, "the pact is struck.  It only awaits my signature,
and..." A sledgehammer blow interrupted his declaration, sending him reeling to the ground.
Buffy and Willow shuddered when they saw the figure who delivered the blow, and was now
punching, kicking, clawing and kneeing the hapless Quentin.</p>

<p>Alt-Buffy had remained hidden from sight, listening to Quentin's mad plan until she could hear
no more.  "Don't pass out on me now, ass-wipe!" she shouted, a year's worth of rage boiling
over in her gut.  "I want you to look at me, to know who it is who kills you!"</p>

<p>"Buffy, don't do it!" Giles shouted at the time-traveler.  "He's not worth it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, this is worth it, Giles!" Alt-Buffy screamed, a desperate cry of righteous rage.  She
grabbed Quentin by the collar of his shirt, and shook him with her one good hand.  "Do you
know who I am, Quentin?  DO YOU?"</p>

<p>Quentin, dazed by the onslaught, turned a bruised eye toward his captor, and gasped.  "Bu-
Bu- Buffy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dickweed, Buffy!  I came from the future, from the world that you created.  You signed
a deal with that thing that calls himself Snyder.  But do you know who he really is?  He's
Belial, a major demon!  He used your blasted contract to invade this world, to lead an army
of vampires, to destroy every living thing on this planet!"  </p>

<p>She threw him onto the bleachers, hard enough to break his arm.  "My world is dead!"  As
he struggled to right himself, she rammed her palm up his jaw, breaking seven of his teeth.
"Humanity is extinct!"   She tried to kick him in the side, but Xander finally managed to grab
her by the arm, restraining her, just barely.  "And you killed them all!"  She struggled in
Xander's grip, but was unable, with only one arm, to get enough leverage to break free.</p>

<p>"Congratulations, Quentin," Giles intoned, his disgust at his former superior officer putting
steel in his voice.  "You just surpassed Judas Iscariot as the greatest traitor who ever lived."</p>

<p>Quentin, his body one vast area of pain, looked around at the two Buffies, and the others
who had gathered around them.  "My-my God," he stammered, his speech slurred by
extensive injuries to his jaw.  "Is this true?"  Giles nodded.  Alt-Buffy finally stopped
struggling and just glared at Quentin.  Perhaps no human face before had ever displayed such
contempt, such raw, unfettered hatred.</p>

<p>"Come now, Quentin," Snyder smiled.  "You're not going to let these deliquents sway you
from the great work you're about to complete, are you?  For the first time in millenia, there
will be peace between the two worlds.  You can't bail out now."</p>

<p>"Get thee behind me, Satan!" Quentin whispered.  "You misrepresented yourself, demon.
You lied to me about your intentions.  You make me ashamed of my part in this blasphemy.
No more!  I refuse to sign your contract, monster!  Our pact is null and void!  Begone to
your realm and never come back!"  For a full ten seconds, not a sound could be heard.  The
injured Quentin and the supplicant Snyder just stood, staring at each other, each daring the
other to make the next move.</p>

<p>Snyder stepped forward until he was just inches away from Quentin.  He sagged his
shoulders, saying, "I'm sorry you feel this way, friend."  He then lunged his right hand
forward, bursting through Quentin's ribcage, and pulling out his still-beating heart.  He
stepped over the newly-killed corpse, taking the parchment on which the contract was
written.  He smeared the heart over the parchment, chanting;</p>

<p>"Words of a traitor, penned in black;
Blood of a traitor, to seal the pact.
So long as this contract is in my hand,
This world is no more the dominion of man!"</p>

<p>His laughter echoed across the field, and beyond, disturbing the dreams of all sleeping people
around the world, and chilling the souls of the waking.  Snyder turned toward the younger
Buffy, the grin on his face reminescent of Batman's eternal nemesis, the Joker.  He seemed
taller, more muscular, no longer the weakling authoritarian he appeared to be at Sunnydale
High, but a true force of evil.   "Remind me, Buffy, what was the name of that song you and
your classmates liked?" he chortled.  "By REM, I believe?  Ah, yes; 'It's The End Of The
World As We Know It, And I Feel Fine'!"</p>

</table>

<p>"Elizabeth Anne Summers," Belial, the demon who wore the shape of former
high school
principal Roland Snyder hissed through gleaming teeth as he tossed Buffy
body around like a
rag doll, "you don't know how much pleasure I'm deriving from this
moment!" Buffy
managed to roll as she landed to minimize any injury, but the force of the
impact with the
ground still knocked some of the wind out of her. "I thought that
merely expelling you was
the height of bliss for me, but actually killing you, oh, that's the
ultimate rush!"</p>

<p>Xander threw himself at the demon Belial, desperately trying to stop his
assault on Buffy, only
to be shrugged off like a spit wad. "Pathetic as always, Xander,"
Belial responded to the
attack. "Don't be impatient, I'll get around to killing you soon
enough!" </p>

<p>As Xander fell back, Spike took his turn. Sword in hand, he
approached the demon almost
casually, saying in a conversational voice, "'Ere now, gov, that's no way
to act. If you're
gonna take over this mudball, you're going to have to get along with the
local-UNGHH!"</p>

<p>"You shame your kind, whelp," Belial hissed, as he cracked Spike's skull
with one blow,
knocking the vampire unconscious. "Hanging around with the
cattle! That's all they are, do
you hear? Cattle!" He returned his attention to Buffy, who had
managed to stand up and
dodge his next blow. She was getting stronger, in part the result of
the anti-toxin Willow had
given her and in part the result of her confession of love for her.
But Belial was a tough one,
maybe even stronger than what Mayor Wilkins became after his
Ascension. She didn't know
if she could hold out long against him.</p>

<p>"I remember concerning with your mother, when I tried to enforce your
expulsion," the
demon continued, "and her pitiful efforts to have you reinstated. She
asked me how I could
be so caviler about your future." Buffy tried to duck his
outstretched arm, but he proved too
fast for her. He grabbed her by the hair, pulling her face up toward
his. "Your future! Don't
you see? My sole purpose in being on your miserable dirt ball of a
planet is to insure that you
and your entire species didn't have a future! That fool Wilkins
thought that he could eliminate
me, but I showed him! This world is mine! MINE!" He
laughed gleefully, assured that no
one could stop his conquest. </p>

<p>As she struggled to release herself from Belial's grip, Buffy was
peripherally aware of Giles
firing several bolts from his crossbow with point-blank accuracy, only to
watch them bounce
off the monster's hide. She noticed Willow about to fire another
crossbow at Belial, only to
watch as the fiend raised his left fist and landed it on Willow with the
force of a club. </p>

<p>Buffy screamed as she watched her newly discovered love fall, and managed
to twist her
body upwards to connect a high scissor kick to Belial's jaw. The
demon was sent reeling,
briefly loosening his grip on Buffy's hair, but with enough time for Buffy
to gain her freedom.
She immediately ran to Willow's side, calling out to her; "C'mon, Willow,
don't die on me, not
now!" Instinctively she checked for a pulse and breathing and was
relieved to find both.
"Will? Are you okay? How you feeling?"</p>

<p>Willow choked and wheezed as she tried to regain her composure. She
looked at Buffy and
said, gasping, "I--feel as though--a very large demon--used me for a
punching bag. Other
than that, not too many complaints. I think that the last of my
herbal spell cushioned the
blow, but my shields are down. I don't think I can take another blow
like that."</p>

<p>"Don't try, love," Buffy murmured as she took her Willow into her
arms. "I'm not going to
lose you now that I found you." She kissed her on the forehead, and
turned toward the
battlefield. Belial had been suddenly occupied by the forces of the
Initiative, who had
concentrated their firepower on the demon. Electro-rifles and other
energy discharging
weapons fired heavily at Belial, but if they had any effect on him, he
didn't show it.</p>

<p>"Pour it on, men!" Riley shouted. "Everything you got! Fry that
bastard!" Bolts of electricity,
gouts of flame, beams of concentrated photons, all converged on their
target. With each
passing second, the demon Belial slowly shed his human guise, resembling
his true form, or as
close to his true nature as mere mortals can fathom. Willow thought
he resembled the demon
from the "Night On Bald Mountain" sequence from Disney's "Fantasia".
Buffy recalled the
Tim Curry character from "Legend", while Xander saw it as an anime
monster.</p>

<p>As the fiend transformed, however, he laughed. His unearthly laughter
rolled across the
battlefield like the thunder of doom. "You can't stop me," he
shouted, mocking the soldiers.
"I'm eternal! I am the author of all misery! I will foul this
planet with my seed! I will sear the
mountains, I will boil the oceans, I will..."</p>

<p>"YOU WILL SHUT YOUR STINKING PIE-HOLE!" A swift flying kick to the
jaw caught
Belial off guard, as Alt-Buffy pressed her attack against the demon.
The monster who
destroyed her world wasn't going to get his chance, not if she had anything
to say about it.
She kicked, gouged, bit, clawed, attacked with feral savagery. "I've
spent the last years of
my life fighting scum like you!" Foot to the ribs. "You think you're
so damn hot?" Fist to the
jaw. "You're just another demon with delusions of grandeur!" Heel to
the groin. "And I'm
just the girl to send you back to Hell!" She delivered another
scissor kick, directly to his
hideous head.</p>

<p>Belial grabbed her ankle in mid-flight, and her inertia tossed her flat on
her back. "Fool," he
grinned at Buffy. "A hundred Slayers cannot stop me now. Get
the message yet, Summers?
Invincible. Look it up." He stamped his cloven hoof down hard
on Alt-Buffy's torso,
severing her spine. "I'd like to stay and chat, Summers, but I have a
world to destroy.
Sorry, I'm swamped." He turned away from the fallen slayer, and rose
his muscular arms, the
contract clutched tightly in his right hand. With his gesture, a maw
opened in mid-air. The
flaw in space widened further, casting a baleful light over the
field. The two Buffies, Giles,
Xander, Anya and Willow all knew what the maw was; the Hellmouth was
opening, at
Belial's command. And soon, all that was foul would rush forth onto
the world.</p>

<p>Riley rushed to the fallen Buffy, joined by her younger counterpart.
"My god," he murmured
as he looked at the wounded slayer's face, and then back at younger
Buffy. "How...how..."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you later," Buffy answered as she tended to Alt-Buffy's slashed
face. "Assuming one,
that there is a later, and two, that we're still on speaking terms,
considering that I've just
dumped you for Willow."</p>

<p>"I'm still your friend, if you'll have me," Riley answered, as he examined
Alt-Buffy. "Oh, God,
Belial did a number on you," he said to the older Buffy, as he took in her
injuries. "I'm afraid
you're looking at permanent paralysis, friend. I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Hey," Alt-Buffy half-smiled at Riley. "Right now, that's the least of my
problems. How do
we stop Belial?"</p>

<p>"It's the contract," Giles, who had emerged from his cover behind the
bleachers and gathered
around the two Slayers. "That's the key; 'As long as the contract is
in my hand', that's what
Belial said! The contract is the conduit by which he's opening
the Hellmouth!"</p>

<p>"So we destroy the contract, and then--" Buffy started, looking at
Alt-Buffy.</p>

<p>Alt-Buffy took the young slayer's hand in her own, and coughing, said, "Do
it."</p>

<p>Buffy nodded at her other self, then said, cold determination in her
voice; "Giles, take care of
her, keep her as comfortable as you can. Riley? Do you have a
spare flame-thrower?"</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Be patient, my brethren," Belial cried out to whatever unholy beings
lurked on the other side
of the opening Hellmouth, "our time of waiting is nigh at an end!
Soon the world that once
was ours will be ours again!" So absorbed with what he was doing was
he that he didn't
notice four lone figures planning against him. Suddenly, a blast from
a flame-thrower seared
the demon's back. He shrieked in brief pain and turned to the
direction of the blast.
"Summers?"</p>

<p>"Hey, Your Ugliness!" Buffy taunted the monster, waving her flame-thrower
around like a
sword, and shouting trash. "I'm the one you want, right? You
want a piece of me? Here I
am, Snydely Whiplash! C'mon, Creepo! Isn't this what you
wanted? You and me, the big
throwdown?"</p>

<p>"You're that impatient to die?" Belial howled. "I shall rend your
flesh, I will use your skin for
a drumhead, your bones as my mallets as I shout my victory
march!"</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah, I'm so shaking, your Skankyness!" She beckoned with her
hands. "C'mon!
You talk the talk, can you walk the walk? Hit me with your best
shot!"</p>

<p>"You will suffer as none before you," Belial promised. He advanced
toward Buffy, not
noticing Riley sneaking around behind him. Suddenly, Riley made his
move; he grabbed
Belial's right wrist, and with adrenalin-fueled strength, managed to loosen
his grip on the
contract and snatch it from his hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly aware that he had lost the contract, Belial turned his
concentration from Buffy
toward Riley, who was running from him fast and furious. "Give me the
contract, you fool!"
he bellowed in rage, lunging at Riley, grabbing his legs.</p>

<p>As he fell, he held out the contract, calling out, "Xander!
Catch!" Xander immediately
grabbed the contract from Riley, and ran off in a zig-zag
pattern.</p>

<p>"Harris receives from Finn and is charging down the field," he shouted as
he crumpled the
contract into a ball, "looking for a long bomb!"</p>

<p>"Xander!" Willow shouted, waving her arms frantically. "I'm
open!"</p>

<p>"Harris throws a bullet to Rosenburg!" he shouted as he tossed the crumpled
contract to
Willow. </p>

<p>Willow ran toward Buffy, crying out, "Rosenburg takes it to the offensive
glass and slams it in
for two points!" </p>

<p>As she took the contract from Willow, Buffy said, "That's basketball!
Xander was going for
football metaphors!"</p>

<p>"So I don't know sports!" Willow shouted. "What do you want me to
do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll think of something later tonight!" Buffy promised, her
smile turning into a leer. She
strode toward Belial, who was still wrestling with Riley. "Yo,
Snyder!" she called out,
displaying the contract, which she had un-crumpled for display
purposes. "Looking for this?"</p>

<p>Belial turned toward Buffy, letting go of Riley. Riley fell to the
ground in an inglorious heap.
"Give me that contract, girl!" Belial screamed as he stalked toward
Buffy.</p>

<p>Buffy simply stood her ground, directly opposite of the wound in the sky
behind Belial. She
held the contract in one hand, the flame-thrower in the other.
</p>

<p>"Snyder!" she called out, grinning from ear to ear, then waited a
beat. "You're expelled!"</p>

<p>She tossed the contract into the air, and as it started to drift lazily to
the ground, she pointed
the flame-thrower at the parchment and fired. The document was ash
before it hit the
ground.</p>

<p>Belial screamed in agony, as the aperture to Hell started to
contract. A violent gust of some
unholy wind blasted the battlefield, and Buffy and the others braced
themselves for the blast.
Belial however was pulled toward the vortex by the unearthly gusts.
Frantically he clawed
the ground with his hands, desperate to fight the pull, but the vortex
would not be denied its
catch. Within seconds, Belial lost his grip on the sod and was
thrown, spiraling, tumbling,
into the portal, which suddenly snapped shut behind him, like the iris
aperture on a camera. </p>

<p>The wind and the light show ceased. A profound silence remained, as
all those assembled
processed what they saw. The calm after the storm was then shattered
by the riotous
cheering of the Initiative troops. Buffy and Willow led the rest of
the Scooby Gang to where
Alt-Buffy was lying. Giles, who had been looking after the brave
young woman, turned
toward Buffy and said to her, "It doesn't look good, I'm afraid. Too
many internal injuries."</p>

<p>"Hey, Buff?" the injured Slayer coughed, trying to smile. "You--did
it--"</p>

<p>"We did it," Buffy smiled back, holding her hand firmly. "You gave us
the time to come up
with the plan. You saved us all."</p>

<p>"Yeah," she groaned, smiling through her agony. "But there's
still(ugh)--still one thing--I have
to do. Behind the bleachers--" Buffy nodded, and ran to where
she indicated. She fetched
the tattered old duffel bag, and returned quickly to the fallen
Slayer.</p>

<p>Willow had cradled Alt-Buffy's head as she had done with her Buffy not long
before, as Giles
was trying to steady her, saying, "Please, Buffy, try to hold still, or it
will only hurt more..."</p>

<p>"No, Giles," she stopped him. "You don't understand. I need the
staff--to finish--the spell--
I'm not supposed to exist anymore--"</p>

<p>"No, Buffy!" Willow wailed. "You can't die, not now!"</p>

<p>"But it's not--not death, Wills," Alt-Buffy answered her dearest friend,
lifting her hand with
great effort to stroke her cheek. "The Buffy you love--is right
here. She's not going
anywhere." Alt-Buffy took Willow's hand, and placed it in Buffy's,
who reached around
Willow with her other arm, holding her closely. "Please.
Promise me--that you'll love each
other."</p>

<p>"We will," they said in unison, and looked at each other as the words were
spoken. For all
intents and purposes, they realized, they had made a lifetime commitment of
love and trust, as
binding as a wedding vow. A commitment they both knew they would
honor for the rest of
their lives together.</p>

<p>No more words were said, as Buffy handed her time-lost other self the Staff
of Hermes. The
brass rod glistened in the dim streetlights around them, and then seemed to
come alive in Alt-
Buffy's hand, with an incandescence of its own.</p>

<p>Alt-Buffy held the staff aloft, closed her eyes one last time, and said in
as clear a voice as she
could muster, "Mutatis Mutandis." Her arm gave out its last iota of
strength, as she slumped
in Willow's arms. Her body then seemed to shimmer, to ripple, to
fade, until only the
memory of those whom she had met remained to testify that she
existed.</p>

<p>Willow wept openly now, her face buried in Buffy's shoulder, as Buffy
stroked her lover's red
hair and whispered assurances to her. Her unconditional love for
Willow kept the girl from
crashing, from falling into the abyss. Watching the time traveler
simply accept her fate and
fade from reality was closer to seeing Buffy Summers die than she ever
wanted to get.</p>

<p>Xander coughed an 'ahem' to get their attention. "I hate to break
this little lover's moment up,
girls," he said quietly, "which, incidentally, I'm entirely cool with, in
case you were
wondering," Anya nodded in silent agreement with her boyfriend. "But
what happened to
Spike?"</p>

<p>They turned around, and Buffy nodded, "He's headed out, toward Wetherly
Park. Let him
go, Xander. He's still got that chip. He won't be putting the
bite on anyone tonight." Her
lame pun got a smile out of Willow, a smile which melted Buffy's heart like
ice-cream on a
hot day.</p>

<p>"Giles," she turned to her mentor and asked, "Just what did Alt-me say just
before--" she
couldn't finish.</p>

<p>" 'Mutatis Mutandis'," Giles explained somberly. "Old Greek.
Meaning, 'The necessary
changes have been made'." The others nodded</p>

<p>Riley Finn watched these events unfold, realizing two things; First, that
there were truly some
events that modern science could not begin to explain; and Second, that
Buffy Summers and
Willow Rosenburg were as much in love as any two people that he had ever
known. And
whatever he had hoped for in his relationship with Buffy, he had neither
the right nor the
desire to interfere. Buffy looked at Riley as he started to walk
away, taking his men away
from the field, and felt sympathy for him. She offered a silent
prayer to any god in the
vicinity, that Riley would find someone who could make him as happy as
Willow Rosenburg
made her.</p>

<p>Another thought took hold of Buffy at that point. "I don't know about
the rest of you, but I'm
hungry enough to eat a sled dog team!"</p>

<p>"Omigod," Willow exclaimed, "the antitoxin. Giles said that it would
cause you to become
hungry!" She turned to the Watcher with a sinister grin, adding, "He
also said something
about springing for a post-world-saveage pizza party."</p>

<p>"I did, didn't I?" Giles laughed at the young wiccan. "I'd be
delighted." Giles' announcement
was greeted with cheers from all concerned. "So long as nobody orders
anchovies!" he
amended.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>The pizza party was the social event of the season, Scooby-Gang-wise.
A karaoke system
was available at the pizzeria, and the gang were pleased to monopolize its
use. Anya started
things rolling, with a rousing chorus of the DiVinyl's "I Touch Myself",
amid catcalls from
several other tables. </p>

<p>Xander requested Don McLean's "American Pie" but true to form, sang the
"Weird Al"
Yankovic lyrics. Buffy, Willow and Anya gleefully sang along with the
second chorus;</p>

<p>"My, my, this here Anakin guy
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry,
And he left his home, kissed his mommy goodbye,
Saying, Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi,
Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi!"</p>

<p>Even the normally reserved Giles got into the act, belting out a
surprisingly decent version of
David Bowie's "Heroes", followed by "Take Me To The Pilot" by Elton
John. On the second
track, Buffy and Willow got on stage with Giles, dancing close together and
singing backup
vocals. Willow then took the stage, saying, "Okay guys, this is a
John Hiatt song. Jewel sang
it in the soundtrack for 'Phenomenon', that John Travolta thing. Here
we go. This one's for
you, Buffy." Buffy smiled beatifically at the mention. The
music started, Willow waited for
her cue, and sang;</p>

<center>
<p>"When the road gets dark,<br>
You can no longer see,<br>
Let my love throw out a spark, baby,<br>
Have A Little Faith In Me.</p>

<p>When the tears you cry,<br>
You can no longer believe,<br>
Give these loving arms a try,<br>
Have A Little Faith In Me.</p>

<p>Have A Little Faith In Me,<br>
Have A Little Faith In Me.<br>
Have A Little Faith In Me,<br>
Have A Little Faith In Me.</p>

<p>When your secret heart<br>
Cannot speak so easily,<br>
Come here darling, whisper a start,<br>
Have A Little Faith In Me.</p>

<p>When your back's against the wall,<br>
Turn around, you will see,<br>
I will catch your when you fall,<br>
Have A Little Faith In Me.</p>

<p>Have A Little Faith In Me,<br>
Have A Little Faith In Me.<br>
Have A Little Faith In Me,<br>
Have A Little Faith In Me.</p>

<p>I've been loving you for such a long time, darling,<br>
I expect nothing in the world but for you to have a little faith in
me.<br>
You see time is our friend, for you and me there is no end,<br>
All you gotta do is Have A Little Faith In Me!"</p>
</center>

<p>She sang with full throat and diaphragm, and from the heart. Any
doubt that Buffy had
concerning the emotions they shared was eliminated by her heartfelt
display. At the close of
the song, Willow bowed deeply, smiling broadly. Buffy met her at the
stage, and hugged her
close, kissing her cheek. "I love you, Wills," she whispered into her
ear.</p>

<p>"I love you back, Buffy," Willow answered.</p>

<p>"Y'know," Xander quipped, his mouth full of Canadian bacon and pineapple
pizza, "It seems
to me that we've heard from everyone at this party, except a certain
Vampire Slayer we all
know and love," he leered at Willow, "some more than others." Willow
threw a straw at
Xander, as Anya chuckled.</p>

<p>"Yeah, Buffy, let's see you humiliate yourself in this cultural display of
vanity," Anya purred.</p>

<p>"Oh no," Buffy protested. "You don't want to hear me sing, really."
But her protests were
drowned out by Xander and Anya chanting, "Buffy, Buffy, Buffy!" She
turned to Giles for
support, but he merely shrugged, "I'm sorry Buffy, but you're on your
own."</p>

<p>"Please, Buffy?" Willow entreated, giving a deadly combination of her
Resolve face and Big
Puppy Dog Eyes face. Buffy looked at her amazed.</p>

<p>"You play dirty, you know that, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Wait until I get you alone, Slayer," Willow grinned, winking. Anya
whooped with glee at
Willow's efforts at seduction. </p>

<p>Buffy threw her hands up, saying, "Okay, okay, before this conversation
gets aired on late
night Cinemax, I'll do it!" The Scoobs applauded as Buffy looked at
the play list. Selecting a
song she thought appropriate, she took the stage, announcing, "This one's
for you, Willow. A
little Natalie Merchant. You have been warned." The song
started, and Buffy sang out a
surprisingly clear string of 'la-la-las' leading up to the song;</p>

<center>
<p>"You've been so Kind and Generous,<br>
I don't know how you keep on giving,<br>
For your kindness,<br>
I'm in debt to you.<br>
For your selflessness, my admiration,<br>
For everything you've done, you know I'm bound,<br>
I'm bound to thank you for it,</p>
</center>

<p>La-la-la, la la la la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la la la la---</p>

<center>
<p>You've been so Kind and Generous,<br>
I don't know how you keep on giving,<br>
For your kindness,<br>
I'm in debt to you.<br>
And I never could have gone this far without you,<br>
For everything you've done, you know I'm bound,<br>
I'm bound to thank you for it!</p>
</center>

<p>La-la-la, la la la la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la la la la---</p>

<p>I want to thank you for the many gifts you gave,<br>
For the love and tenderness, I want to thank you.<br>
I want to thank you for your generosity,<br>
For the love and the honesty that you gave me.<br>
I want to thank you, show my gratitude,<br>
My love and my respect for you, I want to thank you,<br>
I want to thank you, thank you,<br>
Thank you, thank you,<br>
Thank you, thank you,<br>
Thank you, thank you..."</p>

<p>The song ended, friends cheered, and the party went on for several hours
after. When the
party wound down, the two girls went back to their dorm to finish packing
for winter break,
a task they started just that afternoon, a lifetime ago.</p>

<p>Buffy took Willow in her arms again, and kissed her soundly. Willow
reciprocated, and their
mouths and tongues sought to taste, to feel each other.
Breaking away reluctantly from the
kiss, Buffy smiled to the love of her life, saying, "You know, I never
quite felt like this before."</p>

<p>"I'll bet you say that to all the girls," Willow said, trying to sound
sultry. Buffy had to admit
she was getting close.</p>

<p>"No, Wills, really," she tried to explain her thoughts, despite the
distraction of Willow's
blowing on her ear. "It's like I finally know what my life is all
about. Sure, I'm the Slayer, the
one girl who can stand against the vampires, the demons, yadda yadda, but
now there
something more. Being here with you, holding, touching, kissing..."
she couldn't resist taking
another sip from Willow's lips before continuing, "it's like I'm
renewed. Like this is what it's
all about. The reason I keep fighting the nasties. Why I keep
saving the world. Because
you're a part of that world. You're my world, Willow. I don't
know how to explain it any
better than that."</p>

<p>"I understand, Buffy," Willow answered, moved by Buffy's confession.
"It's like Oz, Xander,
anyone I thought I was in love with before, that was all just a rehearsal
for loving you. I do
love you so much, Buffy." She kissed her again, and this time, the
kiss grew in tempo and in
heat. Willow's hands felt around Buffy's back, reaching under her
tee-shirt, slowly tugging at
it. Buffy backed away just enough for Willow to slip the shirt off,
revealing a black sports
bra. Buffy started to unbutton Willow's shirt, and within two
minutes, their passion began in
earnest.</p>

<p>For the rest of the night, two lovers explored each other's bodies,
memorizing every curve,
every nuance, every sensation they could elicit from each other.
After their initial frantic
lovemaking, and the first fiery orgasms, they still cuddled, still touched,
still groped, until the
erotic cycle started again, and again for hours. </p>

<p>They were fully aware that the real world would crash in on them later on,
and there would
be challenges to face in the cold light of day. There was still the
Initiative to deal with.
Despite their assistance in the final battle with Belial, Buffy still
didn't know what to make of
them. There was the problem of how others on campus would take their
newly defined
relationship, once it became public knowledge("And it will" teased Buffy,
"because you're
such a screamer!"). And there was the constant parade of demons,
vampires and assorted
monsters to deal with on a nightly basis.</p>

<p>But for this one night, none of that mattered. There were only two
young women, who had
been burnt by first loves before, only to find in each other the love that
they had been
searching for all along.</p>

<p>And for one beautiful night, there wasn't a thing wrong in Sunnydale,
California.<BR><BR></p>

<p>Epilogue; An Angel's Blessing.</p>

<p>Los Angeles, New Year's Eve, 1999;</p>

<p>"Hey, Boss," Cordelia Chase greeted the youthful looking man who walked
into the office
that night. "How's life--uh, so to speak."</p>

<p>"Fine, Cordy," Angel answered. "Any plans for tonight?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not really," Cordelia answered. "Just me and a bottle of cheap
champagne, waiting for
the computer to crash. Oh, speaking of which, I got an e-mail from
Willow."</p>

<p>"Hey, that's good," Angel perked up. "How's our favorite
hacker?"</p>

<p>"Still hacking," Cordy started. "Uh, you may want to sit down for
this," she added nervously.</p>

<p>"What's the what, Cordy?"</p>

<p>"Well," she started, "Willow's found someone new."</p>

<p>"That's all?" Angel asked, puzzled. "I knew about her and Oz
splitting, but if she's found
someone else, isn't that good news?"</p>

<p>"Uh, it's who that someone else is that's problematic," Cordy
started.</p>

<p>Angel looked directly into her eyes, and asked, "Is it Buffy?"</p>

<p>Cordelia sat slack-jawed at the vampire's observation. "How-how
did--"</p>

<p>"Hey, I've been around for more than a few years," Angel smiled. "A
couple hundred years
of people-watching, you pick up a few things. Buffy and Willow have
always had this
connection, I've been aware of it from day one. That's why Angelus
kept threatening Willow
when he was out to get back at Buffy. He knew that Buffy would die
before letting anything
happen to Willow."</p>

<p>"And this doesn't bother you?" Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>"Not at all," Angel replied. "I knew that Buffy and I had no future,
that's why I left, to give
her the chance to find someone who could give her what I couldn't. If
she has, I'm happy for
her." Grabbing his duster jacket, he announced, "Come on, Cordy, I am
taking you dancing.
We'll celebrate Buffy and Willow's happiness, and ring in the new year
right."</p>

<p>"What the hell," Cordy answered. "Can we swing by my apartment first,
so I can find a
dress?"</p>

<p>"Sure," Angel quipped, "Then we'll have just enough time to ring in the
year 2001."</p>

<p>"Hey!" Cordy complained as they left his office, "That's why I left
Xander..."</p>
