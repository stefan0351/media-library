<p><cite>"Because even her smile looks like a frown.<br>
She's seen her share of devils in this angel town."<br>
--Rob Mullins "Lullaby"</cite></p>
</center>

<P>The drive from Sunnydale to Los Angeles had been without incident, and she muttered a
Thank God for that, although she had stopped believing in God over a year ago.  It was
difficult to hot-wire the old VW Bug with only one hand, but she had managed.  She had to
manage; it was the only car she could find on short notice with an automatic shift.  Her right
arm having been severed six months ago by a vampire that had been a potential boyfriend, a
stick shift was out.  And she had to get out of Sunnydale.  Away from the demons and
vampires that had finally conquered the city.</p>

<p>Not that she imagined anywhere else to be different.  As far as she was aware, the free
human population of planet Earth was one.  Herself.  Everyone else was a vampire, dead, or
lobotomized cattle, bred only for their blood.</p>

<p>Halfway between Sunnydale and LA, she stopped the car, turned off the engine, and just sat
there.  The numbness had started to wear off, and once she felt the despair return, she knew
that she had to stop driving.  Once she stopped, she performed what had become her ritual.
She opened her old school book bag, and went through its contents, making sure nothing had
disappeared.  Silver tipped throwing stars, crossbow with eleven wooden bolts still ready to
fire, her favorite stake, Mr. Pointy, all present and accounted for.</p>

<p>In addition, she had a stash of canned foods and dried meats that she had managed to raid
from an abandoned supermarket in the back seat.  She looked over her shoulder to make
sure it was still there.  She had made several grocery runs in the last year, each one more
hazardous than before.  Since vampires had no need for what humans thought of as food, she
had a wide assortment to choose from, although there had been no fresh meat, produce or
dairy.  She would have murdered for a hamburger right about now.  Furthermore, some
vampires had staked out most of the remaining markets, hoping to catch a surviving human.
She once slew to protect others, now she had to slay to simply survive.</p>

<p>From the bag's bottom, she produced a small velvet drawstring pouch.  Opening the pouch,
she spilled its contents onto the empty passenger seat next to her, and started to sort through
them.  They were pictures, wallet sized photographs mostly, of those who had meant the
most to her.  The reasons that she kept patrolling, fighting the darkness that threatened to
devour Sunnydale, spitting into the face of Hell.</p>

<p>Joyce.  Her mother.  A fine and strong woman, even if she didn't fully understand her
daughter.</p>

<p>Rupert Giles.  Her mentor and surrogate father.  Stuffy, humorless, stiff as a starched collar,
and the finest man she ever knew.</p>

<p>Angel.  First love.  Tragic loss.</p>

<p>Xander.  The clown.  Always ready with a jibe or a bad pun, and fiercely loyal.</p>

<p>Cordelia.  The prom queen.  A bit stuck-up, a bit self-possessed, but as brave as any.</p>

<p>Oz.  The musician.  The silent one who saw more deeply than most.</p>

<p>Riley.  Handsome.  Sweet.  If only...</p>

<p>Willow.  She always came to her photo last.</p>

<p>Willow.  The computer hacker, the apprentice Wiccan, the roommate, the best friend she, or
anyone, ever had.  And more.  So much more.  If only...</p>

<p>Hot tears started to flow down her cheeks as she looked at her photo.  The shoulder length
red hair, the piercing green eyes, the sweet smile.  She had memorized every expression
Willow's face could produce, and there were many.  Happy Face, Sad Face, Grossed-Out
Face, Big-Puppy- Dog-Eyes Face, and the ever popular Resolve  Face.  Whenever she saw
Willow wearing her Resolve Face, she knew that Willow would win whatever argument they
were engaged in at the time.</p>

<p>God, she loved that look.  God she loved her.</p>

<p>And now, out of that love, she had come to Los Angeles, leaving Sunnydale for the last time.</p>

<p>All of those people whose photos she carried were dead.  They had been turned, shortly
after the Hellmouth opened.  They had become vampires.</p>

<p>And she had been slaying them.  Her mother, Giles, the Scooby Gang, all of them.</p>

<p>Her battle had been lost, but she could not let them live as monsters.  She owed it to the
memory of her friends and loved ones to give their souls peace, to end their existence as
vampires.  So she slew them.</p>

<p>Now, there were two left.  Two living in LA.  Cordelia Chase and Willow Rosenberg.</p>

<p>And Elizabeth Anne "Buffy" Summers had to slay them.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>One of the things that surprised Buffy about the new vampiric world order was the fact that
many amenities of modern life were still maintained.  Electric power, gas, radio and television
broadcasts, even the Internet.  <i>I guess even vampires need to surf the web for
cyberbabes,</i>  Buffy thought to herself.  Naturally, the media had been slanted to fit the needs
of vampires, but Buffy still found the information useful.</p>

<p>For instance, a news broadcast several months ago stated that vampires had taken control of
most of the factories, foundries and mines around the world, and were stoking their furnaces
full blast.  Not that they were interested in producing anything but huge black clouds of sooty
smoke.  By pumping toxic smoke into the atmosphere at a constant rate, they had effectively
blocked out the sun.  Now the daylight was no obstacle to them.  They could operate at any
time, twenty-four/ seven.  And since they didn't need to breathe like living beings, vampires
had no problem with befouling the world which they now ruled.</p>

<p>They also broadcast the live execution of one who had been an enemy of the vampire
community, one of their own.  Angel.  A firing squad of vampires drew their crossbows and
impaled him through the heart.  On live TV.  The night after she slew the vampire that had
been Oz(a vampire/ werewolf hybrid, most vicious), Buffy slipped into the blood bar that had
been her favorite hangout in Sunnydale, The Bronze, and saw the broadcast.  She had to fight
back the tears as never before upon seeing her first love gunned down without mercy, while
the crowd of vampires that surrounded her laughed and cheered as he died.  From that
moment on, Buffy knew that it was over.  The world no longer belonged to homo sapiens, it
belonged to homo sanguinivore.  The vampire.</p>

<p>And Buffy had to fight one of the strongest concentrations of vampires in the world, the
formerly sunny LA, to ensure her beloved Willow's final rest.</p>

<p>Driving through the city limits of LA, Buffy met with zero resistance.  Not so much as a
fanged smile.  A lot of abandoned cars littered the streets.  Buffy was surprised at this
development.  <i> What's the matter?  Don't vampires drive anywhere?</i>   She remembered
how Spike, once the newly vamped Giles removed the implant that the Initiative gave him,
went back to cruising for new blood in a stolen Ford Thunderbird.  He nearly knocked her
down in that old beater, distracting her enough for Riley to deliver the coup-de-grace with a
heavy ax.  Her right shoulder socket still twinged in remembered pain from losing the arm.
She stopped her car, and stepped out, extending her slayer senses to cover as much ground
as possible.</p>

<p>The feedback smashing into her brain reminded her of what it must be like to be strapped to
the amplifier at a Marilyn Manson concert.  Over a million vampires, along with assorted
demons, and other nasties, within a one-mile radius of her location.  The resulting white noise
made it nearly impossible to locate a single vampire.  This wasn't trying to find a needle in a
haystack, this was trying to find a needle in Nebraska.</p>

<p>"Where are you, Willow?" Buffy whispered to herself.</p>

<p>"Bu-ffy."  She turned, startled, at the voice.</p>

<p>The voice whispered on the wind around her.  It was sing-song, spooky, eerie.  It reminded
Buffy of that jumprope rhyme that echoed throughout the Nightmare on Elm Street movies;
<i>One Two, Freddy's after you, Three Four, better shut the door, Five Six, grab your
crucifix...</i></p>

<p>Buffy stood, Mr. Pointy in her hand, ready for anything.  "Show yourself, bloodsucker, I
haven't got all day!"</p>

<p>"Bu-ffy."  The voice was clearer, more distinct.  It was an octave higher than Buffy's voice,
soft, light, sweet, almost like...</p>

<p>"Willow?"  Buffy asked the air around her.  "Where are you?"</p>

<p>"Where I always am, Buffy," the voice came from right behind her.  Buffy spun on her heel,
and her eyes locked onto the monster that had once been her best friend in all the world.</p>

<p>Willow was dressed in a black halter top, with a familiar duster jacket draped over her
shoulders.  "You like it, Buffy?" she asked, modeling her jacket.  "I got it from an old friend.
After I had him turned into a pile of ashes."  She smiled, baring her fangs as she did so, and
Buffy blanched in horror, the implications of her statement becoming clear as an unmuddied
lake.</p>

<p>"Angel," her voice was a whispered agony.  "You set up Angel!  You sent him to the firing
squad!"</p>

<p>"Duh.  Souls are out this year, didn't you know?"   As she walked toward Buffy, her eyes,
once a bright jade green, now a murky olive color with streaks of blood red, never wavered
in their gazing at her one-time friend.  Buffy knew that the former wiccan was trying to
entrance her, and she had to fight it.  <i>C'mon, Buff, just plunge Mr. Pointy into her heart.
Let Willow rest.  Do it! </i></p>

<p>But she looked at her friend's eyes, her hair, her face.  Forgetting that she was a vampire,
Willow was still as beautiful as she ever was.  Buffy felt her resolve weaken.  She couldn't kill
her best friend.  And the vampire knew it.</p>

<p>Willow's smile grew larger, more sinister.  She slowly strode toward the uncertain slayer.  "I'll
let you in on a little secret, Buffy.  I've always loved you.  Not in a best-friends, come-on-
over-and- we'll-do-each-other's-hair way, but in a let's-get-naked-and-do-it-on-the-kitchen-
floor way.  And all this time, I held back, because it seemed so skanky.  But you know, it's
not skanky at all."  Her voice was so soft, so seductive.  Buffy found herself loosening her
grip on Mr. Pointy.  She couldn't do it; Willow was in there.  The one she loved more than
life itself.</p>

<p>Willow was now inches away from Buffy, her breath hot on the slayer's cheek.  "You want
me, don't you.  Well now you don't have to hold back.  It was a good fight, like I said a
lifetime ago, but the fight's over.  And you want me, as much as I want you."  She reached
behind Buffy's neck, and took the back of her head in a gentle yet strong hold.  She purred
as she leaned in for a kiss, a kiss the slayer wanted desperately to happen.  Their lips joined
in a torturously slow movement, and Buffy's knees turned to water.  She knew that she
belonged to Willow now.</p>

<p>"Faith was right all along, Buffy," Willow whispered.  "Want."  Her hand found her way to a
responsive breast, and Buffy moaned at the contact.  "Take."  The aroused slayer didn't
notice that the vampire had bared her fangs, and was about to sink them into her corotid
artery.  "Have."</p>

<p>"Have some of this!" A splash of water doused the vampire and her prey.  Willow shrieked
as though her face was hit by acid.  Buffy blinked, the seductive effect of the vampire's mental
control suddenly broken, and her mind was her own again.  She looked around her, trying to
find her unknown benefactor.  A lithe figure emerged from the shadows, holding a bucket of
water.  Holy water, Buffy correctly guessed from Willow's demonic reaction.  Buffy looked
again at the bucket carrier; long stringy black hair, matted against a battered, beaten yet
familiar face.</p>

<p>"Cordelia?"  She shouted.  "You're not a vamp!"  Indeed, the very visible crucifix at Cordy's
neck gave silent testimony to her humanity.  No vampire could wear such a thing.</p>

<p>"What are you waiting for, Slay-girl?" Cordelia shouted. "Stake her!"</p>

<p>Buffy firmed her grip on Mr. Pointy, and charged toward the enraged vampire.  The thing's
face now wore the bestial contours of a true vampire, gone forever was its human facade.
Looking at this fiend, Buffy could think and act more clearly.  The vampire screamed, and
lunged at Buffy.  Buffy ducked, and then charged upward, knocking the monster out at mid-
flight.  The vampire tumbled, and Buffy jumped on top of her.  Pinning the beast with her
knees, Buffy rammed the business end of Mr. Pointy into the vampire's festering heart.  In a
twinkling, it was over.  The fiend that at one time been Willow Rosenburg, computer hacker,
self-proclaimed 'bad-ass wiccan', and best friend, had instantly been transformed into a pile
of ash.</p>

<p>Buffy kneeled over the ashes of her one-time friend.  She felt barren as the airless wastes of
the moon.  Not having the strength left to do more than cry for her best friend, that's exactly
what she did.  Cordelia took Buffy by the shoulders, saying, "Look, Buffy, not to interrupt
your moment of grief, but we gotta hightail it."</p>

<p>"Where, Cordy?"  Buffy wailed as she turned her tear-streaked face away in despair.  "It's
over!  The good guys lost!"</p>

<p>"Maybe not," Cordy lifted Buffy off of her knees, and forced her to stand.  "I knew that you'd
be here.  I was sent to find you."</p>

<p>"Sent?  By who?"</p>

<p>"By the Powers That Be," Cordy tried to explain.  "C'mon, there's a church two blocks away
from here.  If we keep low, we can make it.  I'll give you the skinny there."  The two women
ducked their heads as they made their way across the street.  Bloodcurdling howls could be
heard around them, which made them quicken their pace.  Within a minute, they made it to
the front door of the dilapidated church, and Cordy opened the heavy oak door, beckoning
Buffy inside.</p>

<p>Once inside, Cordy barred the door with a four-by-four.  "They won't come in here, Buffy.
I've got the place mined with holy water traps." She pointed to several windows, on which
buckets of water were propped.  "Besides, there's enough crosses and such to keep them far
away from here."</p>

<p>"Good thinking, Cordy," Buffy acknowledged.  "But why are you doing this?  What do you
mean by the Powers that Be?"</p>

<p>"They sent me here," Cordy sat down on a pew, motioning for Buffy to join her.  "It's a long
story, I'll give you the highlights."  As Buffy wearily sat down, Cordelia explained.  "Just after
Angel left Sunnydale for LA., he hooked up with a half-demon Irishman named Doyle.
Doyle, it seems, had been in contact with an otherworldly group called the Powers That Be,
and the PTB wanted him to recruit Angel into their cause.  Apparently, if Angel did a certain
amount of good, the PTB could give him his soul forever, and free him of being a vampire.
Doyle helped him, because he could get flashes into the future.</p>

<p>"Shortly after I came to work for Angel, Doyle died.  I kinda got close to him, so he gave me
his gift to see the future before he died.  And let me tell you, Buffy, it's a pain in the rump
roast.  Anyway, just after that happened, I guess the Hellmouth spilled over or something,
because suddenly it's raining vampires."</p>

<p>"Hallelujah," Buffy quipped.</p>

<p>"Yeah.  Well, just after Vamp-Willow betrayed Angel, I tried to take a shot at her, but then I
got me one of those flashes.  I saw you, Buffy.  You came to LA  And I was to meet you
when you got here.  So I got away from Wills, and holed up in here.  Since then, two people,
I guess they were with the PTB, a man and a woman in some weird-ass togas, they came
here.  They gave me something, and told me to give it to you."  She reached behind the pew,
and pulled out an object.  It was a brass rod, eight inches long, with two copper snakes
spiraling around it.  "All they told me was that I had to give this to you, and you would know
what to do with it once  you held it.  And I thought Giles could be vague."</p>

<p>Cordy handed Buffy the scepter, and when Buffy held it in her hand, she felt a surge of
otherworldly power and knowledge.  Images flooded her mind, faces, feelings, objects.  The
site of Sunnydale High School, after it was destroyed during the Mayor's ascension scheme.
Faces of people she loved, and people she hated with a black vengeance.  Giles, Xander,
Willow, her mom, and...Principal Snyder?  And Quentin Travers?  The Watcher that forced
Giles to betray her during her eighteenth birthday?</p>

<p>And one last vision, of her and Willow.  Before she became a vampire, when they were best
friends.  Studying together, laughing, hanging at the Bronze, holding hands, kissing...Kissing?
Buffy blinked at the sight.  She never kissed Willow, not that passionately.  But as she saw
herself surrendering in her friend's arms, something seemed natural about it.  It seemed so
right, so perfect.  Why didn't she see it before? What was that line from 'A Christmas
Carol', 'Are these the shadows of things that will be, or things that may be only? If this
was the 'May Be', then Buffy felt the need to jack it up to the 'Will Be' column.</p>

<p>With these visions, she felt a great calm.  For the first time in years, a peacefulness, a sense of
purpose and well-being filled her soul, and she knew what she had to do.</p>

<p>"It's a time-spell, Cordy," Buffy explained.  "Don't ask me how, but I know.  It's designed to
send me back.  To the day it happened, to try and change it.  I have to do it.  I have to go
back, I..."</p>

<p>"Stop, Buffy," Cordy interrupted, her nose twitching.  "Something smells like..Omigod!
Smoke!"  Bilious clouds of sooty smoke poured into the windows from outside.  Buffy
clambered to one relatively clear window, and peered out.  "Twenty to thirty vamps," she
reported.  "All lobbing Molotov cocktails.  And these timbers don't look up to regulation.
This powder magazine's about to blow!  We gotta get out of here"</p>

<p>"Ixnay, Buff," Cordy shouted.  "You gotta get out.  I'll hold 'em off for as long as I can.  You
have the time spell thingy, use it.  Go back, change all this.  It's the only way!"</p>

<p>Buffy looked long and hard at her friend.  The old Queen C was still in there, still fighting in
her own way.  "All right, Cordy," Buffy said.  She wrapped her arm around Cordy's right
shoulder.
She then handed her her crossbow.  "You only got eleven shots in here, make them count."</p>

<p>"Good luck, Slay-girl," Cordy choked back a sob as her friend sought a clear space on the
floor, near the altar.</p>

<p>At that moment, the windows crashed, as the vampires and demons poured in.  Newbie
vamps came in first, taking the brunt of the holy water traps.  The more experienced vampires
climbed over their suffering bodies, intent on these last two humans in LA  Cordy fired the
crossbow, taking out two vamps with three shots, shouting, "That's for Angel!"</p>

<p>Buffy watched this display for a second, knowing that the vampires would soon overwhelm
Cordy, there were simply too many of them for her to handle.  Shaking her head to
concentrate on the task at hand, she closed her eyes, and raised the scepter high above her
head as she innately knew she had to do.  "Tempus Fugit," she shouted, "Tempus Fragnat!"
And she slammed the scepter onto the floor in front of her.  At the very moment the scepter
made contact with the floor, she saw a vamp sink his fangs into Cordy's neck.  She prayed
that what she saw would be undone.</p>

<p>Ripples of pure white light flashed from the tip of the scepter as lifted it off of the floor,
engulfing the Slayer rapidly until all she could see was the light.  The light didn't blind, instead
it seemed to clarify her vision, yet she instinctively shut her eyes against the brightness.  When
she opened them again, she found herself sprawled out on the street.  She looked around her,
amazed at what she saw.</p>

<p>She stood outside of Wetherly Park, Sunnydale's favorite vampire trolling ground.  It was
mid-afternoon, judging by the position of the sun.  And there was a sun, which she hadn't
seen since the vamps blotted it out with their grey smoke clouds.  Buffy felt as though she had
run a marathon wearing heavy armor, and her legs protested even the act of standing, but she
had to find out when and where she really was.  There was only one place she could think to
find the answers.  Her old home.  She ran to the old house, praying that her mother would be
there.</p>

<p>Praying that she could undo the hellish future from which she had escaped.</p>

<p>And above all else, praying that she would see her Willow again, save her from this terrible
fate, and bring her the happiness she so richly deserved.</p>

<p>"Do my ears deceive me," Buffy joked as she tossed some shirts into her suitcase, "or do
sounds of happiness emerge from the boom box of Willow?"</p>

<p>The red-haired computer hacker turned from her packing and looked toward her
roommate/best friend/Slayer, answering as she made a rude face, "I extend my tongue in your
general direction."</p>

<p>"Some places in SoCal, you can charge $75 dollars for that," Buffy quipped.</p>

<p>"BUFFY SUMMERS!"</p>

<p>"Sorry, Will," Buffy answered, giggling, "I just love making you turn that particular shade of
red. Matches your hair."</p>

<p>"That's it, Slayer," Willow Rosenberg shouted gleefully, grabbing the nearest object from her
bed that could be used as a weapon, "Throw pillows at ten paces!"</p>

<p>"Hey, hey," Buffy said, trying not to giggle as she made a 'Time Out' sign with her hands.
"Can we postpone the duel of honor until after we pack? You know, finals done, ready for
the winter vacation?"</p>

<p>"Okay, Buff," Willow fake-grumbled.</p>

<p>"Seriously," Buffy added as she removed several pairs of blue jeans from her dresser. "It's
good to see you happy, Will. You've been on a Counting Crows/Alanis Morrisette binge
ever since, well, you know--"</p>

<p>"His name is 'Oz'," Willow answered, "and I won't go into screaming mimis if you say we
broke up. That's what happened. Old news."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I know, but I know that it still hurts some. I remember what it was like when Angel
finally left." <i> I also remember a wonderful red-headed Wiccan holding me while I cried
my eyes out,</i> Buffy thought. <i>God I'm glad she's a part of my life.
</i>
"Yeah," Willow sighed as she sorted through her sweater collection. "But both Angel and Oz
did what they had to do. I'm good with that. Besides, I still have you and Xander and Giles,
and I guess Anya," she strained to say it, "plus Tara. So friend-wise, I've got nothing to
complain about."</p>

<p>"You and Tara've been pretty tight lately, I noticed."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Willow admitted. "She's good. She's the only person in the local Wicca group that
seems to take it seriously. She and I work well together." She looked at Buffy's face, and
noticed that she seemed a little distracted. "But don't worry, Buff, you're still my numero uno
compadre. I would never forget you." <i></p>

<p>Like I ever could,</i> Willow admitted silently to herself. Ever since she had met Tara, she had
been conscious of her attraction to the shy young blond witch. So much like herself. Yet so
different. Shortly after those weird silent demons, the Gentlemen, tried to steal the voices of
the people of Sunnydale, Willow was confronted with her attraction for Tara. Whenever she
was near Tara, she was aware of the erotic tension between the two of them. This excited
Willow, and scared her too. She never entertained thoughts about loving another woman,
especially since her conservative Jewish background frowned on homosexuality, but Tara
had really gotten to her. But the last time she saw her, the tension was less. At first, Willow
thought that she was going through a phase, that Tara was a one-time only infatuation. </p>

<p>But then she saw Buffy that one night last week. Sleeping soundly after a quiet patrol.
Willow spent an entire hour just watching her best friend sleep, memorizing the lines of her
face, the sweep of her neck, the delicate rise and fall of her chest as she breathed. When her
sleep grew more fitful, with evidence of one of the many nightmares that plagued the Slayer's
nights, Willow fought down a desperate urge to climb into Buffy's bed and hold her, to
protect her from whatever was harming her in her mind.</p>

<p>More and more, she started to notice Buffy. The long blond hair, the graceful neck and
waist, the firm muscles of her arms and legs from all her working out as a Slayer. The
perfectly proportioned athletic body. <i>Man, if it weren't for the Slaying, she could be an
Olympic gold medalist easy</i>. And last but not least, that wonderfully expressive mouth. On
those infrequent occasions when she did smile, Buffy could exorcize storm clouds. <i>Those
bright sweet lips, what would they taste like? Ooh, bad Willow!</i> At some point, Willow
didn't know when, it dawned on her.</p>

<p>She may have been attracted to Tara.</p>

<p>But she was in love with Buffy.</p>

<p>In the brief silence that followed these thoughts, the Sting song was closing. Among the last
lines of the song were two that thoroughly encapsulated what Buffy meant to Willow, what
Willow could never confide in her friend for fear of losing her;</p>

<center>
<p><i>"You're the hub of my rotation,
You're the sum of my equation."</i></p>
</center>

<p>"It still hurts a little," she continued, trying to distract herself from these decidedly
unwholesome thoughts, "but you know what hurts more? It's knowing that I'd been a total
bitch while dealing."</p>

<p>"Willow Rosenberg, you listen to me now, you are many things, most if not all of them
wonderful, but you are not now, nor have you ever been a bitch."</p>

<p>"Huh, aren't you the one who nearly married Spike because of my stupid spell?"</p>

<p>Buffy winced at the thought of her happy-making spell a few weeks back, and its wacky
consequences. "I didn't say you weren't accident prone, I said you weren't a bitch."</p>

<p>"Okay," Willow conceded, "maybe 'Bitch' is too strong a word. But I can't think of anything
else that fits."</p>

<p>Buffy thought for a second, and suggested, "How about, 'in touch with your inner Cordelia'?"
This reference to their sometime friend got a laugh out of Willow.</p>

<p>"Oh, speaking of Her Royal Skankiness," Willow remembered, "I got an e-mail from her."</p>

<p>"Is she still working for Angel?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Uh-huh. And guess who else they ran into?"</p>

<p>"Uh, Jennifer Love Hewitt?"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha. Wesley."</p>

<p>Buffy dropped her head in her right hand at the name of her wannabe watcher and groaned.
"Wesley "Stiff-upper-lip-while-spine-goes-gelatinous" Price? I guess that Angel's curse still
holds. First Cordelia, now Wes."</p>

<p>"I already sent a sympathy e-mail card." Willow answered as she pulled one more sweater
from the closet.</p>

<p>"Oh, Will?" Buffy asked. "I know that you'll be spending Chanukah with your folks, but you
got plans for New Year's Eve?"</p>

<p>"Nada."</p>

<p>"Mom wanted me to invite the Scooby Gang over for a Y2K survival party. You in? It's
kinda pot luck, but--"</p>

<p>"I'll bring the guacamole," Willow volunteered. "You bringing Riley?"</p>

<p>"Uh, no." Buffy suddenly sounded less than sure. "Riley and me, we're taking some time
apart."</p>

<p>"Oh?" Willow's heart threatened to leap out of her chest when she heard this news. Was this
an opportunity for her and Buffy to--she dashed these thoughts from her mind immediately.
Buffy was confiding in her, it was time for best-friend mode, not potential lover mode.
Taking supreme control of her voice so that it wouldn't squeak, she asked, "Was it something
he said?"</p>

<p>"More like what he didn't say," Buffy answered. "Like, 'Oh, by the way, Buffy, I'm with a
paramilitary demon-hunting organization called the Initiative. You're cool with that, right?'"</p>

<p>"Paramilitary--" Willow started putting two and two together and hoping the answer wasn't
twenty-two. "You mean those guys that 'fixed' our favorite Sting wannabe Spike?"</p>

<p>"Them's the ones. I found out about that during that incident a couple of weeks ago with the
Gentlemen. I was fighting one Gentleman off, some khaki Rambo-ettes show up. I'm
fighting, I don't notice it's Riley until he nearly pulls some kind of ray gun on me and I draw a
crossbow on him. Not exactly the high-point of romance. We agreed that we had to talk,
but so far that's all we agreed on. Except that we need to take a step back. He'll be heading
for Iowa to spend Christmas with his family, I'll be with Mom, we need the time apart to
think, y'know?"</p>

<p>"Aw Jeez, Buffy," Willow answered, genuinely moved by sympathy for her friend. She
turned to Buffy and gave her a friendly arm around the shoulders. "I was rooting for you
two."</p>

<p>"Hey, maybe it'll still work out," Buffy said half-heartedly. "I just wish I knew more about the
Initiative to trust them. To trust Riley. He's the first guy I really liked since Angel left, I just
wanted someone normal."</p>

<p>"Maybe if he's a demon hunter, and you're a vampire slayer, you could go into business
together. Two slayers, no waiting!"</p>

<p>"I dunno, like I said, there's something about the Initiative that has my Spider-sense going off
the meter. Still, it would be nice to love someone who could understand why I do what I
do."</p>

<p><i>Like me,</i> Willow thought but didn't say.</p>

<p>She would have liked to hold on to her friend forever, but real life interrupted in the form of a
ringing telephone. "I'd better answer that," stammered Willow, as she disengaged their hug.
"It could be the phone." She wasn't sure, but Willow could have sworn that Buffy was
reluctant to let go as she was.</p>

<p>She picked up the handset and started talking; "Hello. Oh, Mrs. Summers. How
are...Buffy? Nothing's wrong, she's...Please, Mrs. Summers, she's fine. I don't
understand..." </p>

<p>Buffy's attention had turned toward the phone conversation between her best friend and her
mother. Willow's voice sounded more distressed as she spoke, evidently mirroring her
mother on the other end. "I assure you that she's fine. I...I'm standing not four feet from
her...No, Mrs. Summers, I'm not covering up for her, I'm...Just a second." </p>

<p>She handed the handset to Buffy, saying, "Your mother sounds nearly hysterical. I can't
understand a word she's saying. Can you talk to her?"</p>

<p>"I'll try," Buffy answered as she took the handset and began to speak into it. "Hey, Mom?
Yes, it's me. Mom? Mom, are you crying? Calm down, Mom, slow
down...breathe...inhale...and exhale. Okay. Tell me everything from the beginning. Uh-huh.
Uh-huh. Hmmm. Yeah." She listened intently for a few more seconds, and then answered,
"Okay, Mom. This is why having a Slayer for a daughter is a good thing, 'cause this is the
kind of thing I deal with all the time. I'll call Giles and the gang, and we'll meet you at home
and figure this thing out. Don't worry, we'll get the 411 on this. Okay, I'll be there in ten.
'Bye."</p>

<p>Buffy placed her finger on the cradle button, and then started to dial Giles' house. She shifted
into full Slayer-mode as she spoke to Willow; "Scooby Gang situation, Wills! Defcon Four!"</p>

<p>"Something wrong with your mom?"</p>

<p>"Apparently. According to her, I'm lying on her sofa in her living room. Unconscious, and
missing my right arm!" She waited for Giles to answer the phone. Willow stood beside her
friend, a vague dread creeping up on her soul.</p>

<p>It was going to be one of those nights.</p>

<p>Anya bounced along to the swing-rock stylings of Squirrel Nut Zipper, in what she called
'low-impact aerobics', while Xander, who sat on the couch and watched her work, would
call it 'a religious experience'. The earthbound demon, who had in her former life wreaked
terrible vengeance against men, now seemed to live to please one man, Xander Harris. Her
total lack of social graces or any sort of tact however, has led to some interesting
confrontations since she and Xander became, in her own characteristic turn of phrase,
"orgasm buddies".</p>

<p>Although he had been living in his parents' basement since he finished high school and drifted
from job to job, he and Anya preferred to hang out at Giles' place. The former watcher and
unofficial den father for Buffy and the Slayerettes was slightly more accommodating than
Xander's uncaring parents. The fact was that he found something admirable in Xander; his
glib humor in the face of danger, his unwavering courage, even when he claimed to be
shaking in his boots. He admired that quality in him. </p>

<p>It would be a cold day in the Hellmouth, however, before he admitted it out loud.</p>

<p>Giles entered the room with a hot cup of Darjeeling as Anya concluded her dancing.
"Xander Harris," he griped, "don't you have anything better to do than watch your girlfriend
display her body in such a vulgar fashion?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing in the world," Xander replied with a smile that seemed to extend beyond the
confines of his face.</p>

<p>"The man is a walking hormone," he griped to Anya.</p>

<p>"And this is a bad thing, how?" she answered, her grin matching Xander's.</p>

<p>"Meet Mrs. Walking Hormone," Xander extended his hand to Anya, who grabbed it and
allowed him to pull her on his lap. Giles threw his hands up in disgust and sat down on his
leather highback chair.</p>

<p>"You two are a perfect match," he grumbled. Desperately hoping to change the topic of
conversation, he asked, "Have either of you two seen Spike?" Giles had recently become the
host to the neutered vampire, once one of Buffy's most implacable enemies, now a pathetic
shell of his former malevolent self.</p>

<p>"I think he said something about seeing 'The Sixth Sense' for the fifteenth time," Xander said.
"I think he only goes for the first fifteen minutes, long enough to shout from the back row,
'Bruce Willis's character is dead', before being bounced."</p>

<p>"Charming to the last," Giles harumphed as he sipped his tea. "I suppose as long as he's under
the influence of the Initiative and their implant, he'll be no danger to others."</p>

<p>"I don't understand why we allow him to live," Anya commented as she combed her hands
through Xander's hair. "I mean, he's a vampire, Buffy's a vampire slayer, I say we get those
two together and let her do what comes naturally."</p>

<p>"While I echo your sentiments, Anya," Giles admitted, "he's of more value to us alive. He's
our only link to the Initiative, and we need all the information we can get on them. Besides,
as long as we can keep tabs on him, he's no threat. I'd rather have him where I can keep an
eye on him."</p>

<p>"Keep your friends close and your enemies closer, is that it?" Anya asked.</p>

<p>"Something like that," Giles started to expound when the phone rang. Xander picked up the
phone and greeted the caller; "Cavanagh's Crematorium! Hey, Buffster, 'sup? Sure, I'll get
him for you. Yo, G-Man!" He handed the handset to Giles, who took it silently, having given
up the long fight to stop Xander from calling him 'G-Man'.</p>

<p>"Hello, Buffy. Yes. Yes. One arm, you say. Yes. I can understand how she would be
upset. We'll be right over. Do you need a lift? We'll be there in five minutes. See you then."
He handed the handset back to Xander, who hung it up. "There's some sort of trouble at
Mrs. Summers' house." He explained the situation as Buffy explained it to him.</p>

<p>"One arm, you say?" Anya mused. "That's one less than most people."</p>

<p>"This is serious, Anya," Giles snapped at the ex-demon. "Either someone is playing a cruel
joke on Buffy's mother, or this is a sign of something far more sinister. Either way, we have
to get to the bottom of it."</p>

<p>"Right, Giles," Xander stood up, and in his best Adam West-era Batman voice, said to Anya,
"To the Watchermobile!"</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>In the cramped confines of Giles' Citroen, Willow became more acutely aware of Buffy's
presence. Xander and Anya were in the back seat, getting cozy, and Willow's reaction to
having to sit next to them when Giles picked up her and Buffy was summed up in two words;
"Eww much?" From the days when she was nursing the Mother of All Adolescent Crushes
on Xander (she always capitalized the words when she thought of them), she had been
uncomfortable with the girls Xander would date. First Cordy, Queen C herself, now Anya,
the former vengeance demon. Willow still remembered how Anya had used her to summon
an evil vampire Willow from a parallel universe. So to make the trip more tolerable, she
leaned forward, to where Buffy was riding shotgun.</p>

<p>This placed her head in close proximity with Buffy's, and her nose right near where Buffy
normally dabs her perfume. The subtle floral smell interacted with Buffy's natural body smell,
and the mix was nearly overpowering for Willow. She tried to block the increasingly sexy
thoughts she had been nursing regarding her best friend, and concentrate on other things.</p>

<p>"You know, Buffy," Willow commented, "I know we call ourselves the Scooby Gang, but
there are times when I wish that we really were like the Scooby Gang."</p>

<p>"Explain the logic, Wills," Buffy inquired.</p>

<p>"You know, we'd come upon a haunted house, or an abandoned carnival, then we'd get
chased by a vampire or demon, then we'd chase him back, all to the tune of some lame '60s-
esque music, then we'd all land on him in a dog-pile, then take off the mask, an it'd turn out to
be Mr. Deevers, the disgruntled groundskeeper."</p>

<p>"And he would have gotten away with it to, if it weren't for them meddling kids!" Buffy
shouted happily.</p>

<p>"I get dibs on Shaggy!" Xander chimed in.</p>

<p>"What does that make me then?" pouted Anya. "If you're Shaggy, Buffy's Daphne, and
Willow's Velma..."</p>

<p>"Let's put it to you this way," Willow answered with an evil grin. "How do you like your
Scooby snacks?" Anya shot Willow a look that would melt ice at fifteen yards.</p>

<p>"How about Sandy Duncan on a guest shot?" Buffy offered. "Besides, why does Willow get
stuck with Velma? She's much better looking, and has never lost her glasses once!"</p>

<p>"Hey, I could be Fred," Willow squealed.</p>

<p>"Nah," Xander said, partially distracted by something Anya was doing with her right hand.
"That means you'd have to wear an ascot."</p>

<p>"I'll pass," Willow conceded the point to her childhood friend.</p>

<p>Giles, for his part, ignored this compelling discussion, as he often did. He didn't grudge them
their interests, far from it. He simply thought them beneath him. However, he did understand
their need to talk about such meaningless minutiae, especially when dealing with menaces like
the Master and Angelus on a regular basis. Sort of like whistling past the graveyard.</p>

<p>"Hey, meddling kids," Buffy interrupted. "Looks like we'll have to table this conversation.
Mom's house, dead ahead." Giles pulled up to the curb, and he and the four Scoobs bailed
out of the car. Buffy and Willow led the way to Mrs. Summers' porch, and Buffy slowly
opened the door. </p>

<p>"Hey, Mom?" she called out. She saw her mother tending to a figure lying on the couch.
Joyce turned toward the door as she heard her daughter's voice, and saw her face peek in
the door. Joyce stood up, walked to the door on unsteady legs, and stopped just short of
Buffy. Buffy saw the haggard look on her mother's face, the red-rimmed eyes, the copious
rivulets of tears streaking her face. Now her face was contorted into a look of startlement at
the sight of her daughter. </p>

<p>"Buffy?" she asked hesitantly. "Is that really you? Oh, dear God..." she could speak no
more. She dissolved into tears again as she grabbed her daughter in a desperate hug. All the
while she murmured, "Oh my God, my baby's all right!"</p>

<p>"Yeah, Mom," Buffy responded, her voice straining against the powerful hug. "And if you
could loosen up your grip, I could maintain that trend." Joyce immediately let go of her
daughter, apologizing profusely. "Hey, Mom, it's okay. From your voice on the phone, you
got a serious wiggins."</p>

<p>"So we're here to de-wigginize the place," Xander answered as he and Anya entered the
room.</p>

<p>"May we see her?" Giles, bringing up the rear, asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly, Rupert," Joyce answered. "I'm sorry. It's just been a series of shocks, seeing
my Buffy...well, look at her!" she motioned toward the couch. Buffy and her cohorts
gathered around the couch, and immediately understood why Joyce Summers was so rattled.</p>

<p>She lay sprawled upon the couch, wearing clothes that hadn't been washed, or probably
changed, in at least several weeks. She slept fitfully, her exhaustion finally catching up with
her. Her legs, visible through shredded jeans, were badly scraped and bruised, and her left
arm bore severe scars. Her right arm was missing, hacked off at the shoulder apparently.
Her hair was matted against a drawn and roughened face. </p>

<p>The face of Elizabeth Anne "Buffy" Summers.</p>

<p>For fifteen seconds, no one dared speak. Finally, Xander announced, "I believe I speak for
everyone when I say, 'Jinkies'!"</p>

<p>&#34;What can you tell me, Rupert?&#34; a desperate Joyce asked the former Watcher.</p>

<p>Giles looked up from his examination of the unconscious young woman on the couch. &#34;I'm sorry, Joyce, but anything I have to say at this time would be strictly in the realm of speculation.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;A simple 'not a clue' would suffice,&#34; Buffy added.</p>

<p>Giles glared at the Slayer, then continued. &#34;I can tell you this; this young woman is obviously not Buffy, or at least not your Buffy. Nor is she a vampire or demon; her skin's too warm for a start, plus her pulse and respiration are strong. Vampires have neither. Also note; the scarring where her right arm was,&#34; he pointed to the shoulder, visible under a tattered tank top, &#34;the scars are a few months old. And she looks physically older, and not just in years. No, this woman's been through hell and back.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Could she be from a parallel universe?&#34; Willow asked nervously. &#34;Like the one my evil vampire twin came from?&#34;</p>
<p>Xander added, &#34;Me, I've got five dollars that says that this involves time travel.&#34;</p>

<p>Anya looked at her boyfriend and asked, &#34;You have five dollars?&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Please,&#34; Giles interrupted, &#34;this speculation is getting us nowhere. Right now, she seems healthy, for all the damage that has been done to her body. For now, all we can do is keep her comfortable, and--&#34;</p>
<p>Giles suggestions were drowned out by Buffy's double muttering loudly in the throes of a nightmare; &#34;No, no, not Willow, not you, not my Wills! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&#34; Suddenly, she bolted to an upright position, her eyes wide open, red-rimmed and big as baseballs, a sheen of sweat covering her body, her jaw locked open in fear. Her head darted from face to face, from one corner of the room to another, like a caged rat. She trained her eyes on Giles, and demanded, &#34;Who are you?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;My name is Rupert Giles,&#34; he answered. &#34;Should I call you Buffy?&#34;</p>

<p>The woman grabbed Giles' arm roughly by the wrist, and placed her thumb firmly over the primary vein. Giles was surprised by this development; even with one arm, she still possessed a slayer's strength.</p>
<p>The young woman held his wrist for a few seconds, her look of fear soon giving way to a look of astonishment, then one of great relief. &#34;A pulse,&#34; she whispered, gasping. &#34;You have a pulse.&#34; She noticed Giles panting. &#34;You're breathing! Quick, Giles. The time!&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You seem to have the wrist with a watch, Buffy,&#34; Giles commented. Buffy quickly let go, and Giles looked at the watch face. &#34;I have it at four-twenty-five. Just at sundown.&#34;</p>
<p>The older Buffy looked impatiently at Giles. &#34;Date, month, year!&#34; she shouted, waving her hand in a circular motion.</p>
<p>&#34;Time travel,&#34; Xander asserted. &#34;Told you.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It's the nineteenth of December, 1999,&#34; Giles answered. Buffy sat forward on the couch in wonder.</p>
<p>&#34;It worked,&#34; she said simply. &#34;The spell worked.&#34; She then leapt off of the couch, shouting, &#34;I MADE IT!&#34; She grabbed Giles in a one-armed hug, squeezing him like a vice. &#34;God I missed you, Giles!&#34; she cried, tears of joy spilling from her eyes. Giles found himself holding her as hard as he could, his normally stoic exterior crumbling under this genuine display of affection.</p>
<p>She let go of her mentor, spun around the room, her eyes lighting on Joyce. &#34;Mom, you're still alive! Oh God,&#34; she rushed headlong into Joyce's arms, nearly knocking her to the floor with the ferocity of her embrace. &#34;Oh God, I love you, Mom,&#34; she cried over and over.</p>
<p>&#34;I love you too, sweetie,&#34; Joyce answered, at a loss for anything else to say. Holding her, however, had convinced her that this was no demon or vampire; this was as much her daughter as the young woman standing beside her.</p>
<p>Older Buffy disengaged from hugging Joyce, and turned to Xander and Anya. &#34;X-Man!&#34; she exalted, slapping him on the back with gusto. &#34;Ya old knuckle-knob! How the hell are ya?&#34; Xander stood dumbstruck at her assault, but had no time to respond as she turned her attentions to his girlfriend. &#34;Anya, I'm even glad to see you! C'mere you old vengeance demon ya!&#34; she wrapped her arm around Anya's neck, shouting, &#34;If I had both arms, I'd give you a noogie!&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'm grateful for small favors then,&#34; Anya said under her breath.</p>

<p>&#34;Buffy?&#34; Willow asked the human tornado which had been ripping through the Summers house.</p>
<p>Older Buffy stopped and spun toward Willow. &#34;My God, Wills?&#34; she asked in a little-girl voice. &#34;It's you, isn't it? You're not a vamp? You're alive?&#34; Willow nodded timidly, uncertain what this doppleganger would do next.</p>
<p>The older Buffy, tears streaming from her eyes, strode slowly toward Willow, and fell into her arms. She wailed loudly, bawling like a little baby, babbling incoherently. At times, Willow thought that she heard Buffy saying, &#34;Oh, God, I'm sorry Will, I'm so sorry, so sorry&#34; repeating her apologies for whatever unspoken crime she had committed. In some corner in the back of her head, it reminded Willow of Heather Donahue at the end of &#34;The Blair Witch Project&#34;, holding her camera up to her face and making a last desperate confession. Willow would have laughed, if not for the surreal quality of this current situation.</p>
<p>Then the blond grabbed Willow's neck and brought her face level with her own. &#34;Don't worry, Wills,&#34; she said solemnly. &#34;I swear by the love I have for you that it won't happen again.&#34; Before Willow could ask what she was talking about, the maimed Slayer pulled Willow's face to her own, and kissed her hard on the mouth.</p>
<p>The kiss lasted for several seconds, long enough for Xander to whistle softly, commenting, &#34;Whoa, subtext much?&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy--the one with two arms--looked at this bizarre scene, and commented, &#34;Okay, I'm officially freaked out now.&#34;</p>
<p>The older Buffy stopped the kiss at these words, and finally acknowledged her counterpart. She let go of Willow, and turned to her younger self. &#34;My God, seeing you like this,&#34; she stammered. &#34;I almost forgot what it was like. To be hopeful, to have friends like this--Don't worry, Buffy, it won't happen to you like it did for me. We can change it. We have to.&#34; These last words were spoken as a vow.</p>
<p>&#34;Hoo-boy,&#34; Xander commented. &#34;Okay, Alt-Buffy. Maybe you should start at the beginning and work your way up to 'it won't happen to you like it did for me'.&#34; As Xander spoke, a tea kettle started to whistle in the kitchen. &#34;I thought that you might like some tea or hot cocoa,&#34; Joyce said absently. She quietly headed for the kitchen while Giles and the Scoobs looked anxiously at the stranger in their midst, waiting for the bomb to drop.</p>
<p>Alt-Buffy looked at the faces that surrounded her. They were her friends, yet in a way not. She was an outsider to them, yet she was the same young woman who they called daughter, friend, beloved. She found her way back to the couch, and collapsed with a thud. &#34;I'll tell you what I can, guys, but I don't know all the facts myself. Xander was right, however. I am from the future, just over a year from now, I'm not sure, I stopped counting dates after a while. They stopped being important.&#34; As she spoke, she accepted a cup of hot chocolate with miniature marshmallows that Joyce had made for her. Joyce passed hot chocolate around for the rest of her guests, along with tea for Giles, and they drank their cups silently as Alt-Buffy told her story;</p>
<p>&#34;You see, tonight, December 19, something terrible happens. I'm not sure what. All I know is that I was patrolling around Whetherly Park, trolling for vampires, when suddenly, dark clouds covered the sky, fire erupted from near where Sunnydale High School used to be, then the next thing I know, the Hellmouth is open for business. I mean wide open. I have no idea what caused it, I just knew that we were in major trouble. Worse then the Master and Angelus combined, then squared.</p>
<p>&#34;The next two months, we tried to figure out what happened, Willow holed up in the college library behind her computers, Giles buried himself in the stacks, I tried to fight everything that poured out of the Hellmouth. It was too much for me, even for an army of slayers. The Initiative tried to fight alongside me, but they were severely outclassed. One or two of them were turned, and they turned everyone else in their bunker. Then,&#34; she caught her breath, then continued, &#34;the vampires turned everyone else. Mom, Giles, Xander, Willow, Oz, everyone.</p>
<p>&#34;All of Sunnydale became vampires. Then all of California, then all of the continent, then all the world. It spread like the common cold, like that plague from &#34;The Stand&#34;, until only a handful of normal people were left. They were captured by the vamps, lobotomized, branded as cattle and kept only to produce blood for the vamps. I guess they kept me alive for revenge. They knew I was the Slayer, and I stopped the demons of the Hellmouth from destroying the world before, so they kept me alive to see their final victory. I became Charlton Freaking Heston in &#34;The Omega Man&#34;!&#34;</p>
<p>She narrated her tale in a dull monotone, her fear responses deadened a long time ago. She had lived through this horror, but for her audience, it was as fresh as each tomorrow. Joyce absently chewed her knuckle, Xander held Anya a little tighter, and Willow wanted nothing more than to hold this woman's hand, and drive out whatever foul visions she had witnessed. She wanted nothing more than to be a friend, and hopefully a lover, for this damaged woman.</p>
<p>&#34;It was six months ago, when I saw Angel being killed on live TV, when I decided there was only one thing for me to do. It was about that time when I became a southpaw,&#34; she added, indicating her right shoulder. &#34;Oz held me down, while Riley hacked it off with an ax. Anyway, I realized that had to find my friends and family who had been turned, and slay them. Destroy their vampire bodies, so that their souls could find rest. Once that was over, I would take the nearest sword and drive it into my heart. Better to die by my own hand, than risk being turned, right? I was going to Hell anyway, why not on my own terms?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;But something else happened, or else you wouldn't be here,&#34; Giles hazarded a guess.</p>

<p>&#34;Yeah,&#34; Alt-Buffy answered over a sip of chocolaty goodness. &#34;I ran into Cordy, after taking out Vamp-Willow in LA. Turns out that she had been hiding out in an old church, and avoided being vamped. She hooked up with some outfit called the Powers That Be, and they gave her something--Mom, where's my duffel bag?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Right here, honey,&#34; Joyce fetched the ratty old bag and handed it to the injured slayer. Buffy rummaged through the bag, and withdrew the scepter. Giles looked at the device, a brass rod entwined by two copper snakes, and nearly dropped his tea onto his lap. &#34;My God,&#34; he whispered reverenty. &#34;The Scepter of Hermes!&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Who-mes?&#34; asked the younger Buffy.</p>

<p>&#34;Hermes,&#34; Xander snapped his fingers. &#34;Wasn't he the Greek god of speed? Yeah, he was in charge of travelers and roads, too, wasn't he?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Very good, Xander,&#34; Giles commented, genuinely impressed. He then thought for a second, and asked him sternly, &#34;Did you get that from an episode of 'Xena, Warrior Princess'?&#34;</p>
<p>Xander smiled innocently, &#34;Educational television. Gotta love it!&#34;</p>

<p>Giles let out an audible exasperated sigh, and continued in full Professor Mode; &#34;According to legend, Hermes was gifted by Hephaestus, the god of the forge, with a staff and winged shoes, that allowed him to fly, and travel at any speed imaginable. With the staff, the myths say, no place on Earth, in Heaven or in Hell was too distant to him. If these so-called Powers That Be are associated with the godlike beings that recruited Angel, then this must be that very staff! Amazing!&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Great, so we stick it in a crate next to the Ark of the Covenant, Indy?&#34; Buffy asked. &#34;What does this have to do with whatever's going down tonight at Sunnydale High?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;That staff is what brought me here, Buffy,&#34; Alt-Buffy answered. &#34;I guess if no place in the universe is to distant for it, that must mean time-travel as well. I don't know how it works, really, I just got impressions from it, including a spell to recite when activating it; 'Tempus Fugit, Tempus Fragnat'.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Oh, oh,&#34; Willow barked excitedly, grasping at something that she could understand in this strange conversation. &#34;That means 'Time Passes, Time Breaks', or something like that, right?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Something like that, yes, Willow,&#34; Giles agreed. &#34;Uh, Alt-Buffy, I guess,&#34; he turned toward the older slayer. &#34;You say you received images from the scepter. What kind of images?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Mostly faces and things from my past,&#34; Alt-Buffy answered. &#34;Lots of stuff from Sunnydale High, especially the old football field. I also got some images of Mr. Snyder for some weird reason.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Oh God, Snyder?&#34; Xander groaned at the thought of the late unlamented principal of Sunnydale High. &#34;Give me the Master, give me Angelus, give me another Ascension. Give me the Master and Angelus with front row seats for the Ascension, but please dear God, not Snyder!&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I wouldn't worry about Snidely Whiplash,&#34; Buffy commented, &#34;seeing as how he got gobbled up by His Honor during our graduation. Much dead now.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No he isn't.&#34;</p>

<p>Six pairs of eyes fixed themselves on the speaker. Anya, who had kept her own counsil during this exchange, finally saw fit to speak up.</p>
<p>&#34;I hate to contradict, Anya,&#34; Willow said, &#34;but he got eaten up real good by a Snyder-eating dragon-sized demonic mayor Wilkins. It was the highpoint of the commencement excercizes.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;A human named Snyder was eaten,&#34; Anya insisted, &#34;but the animus remains. Belial.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;Belial, Belial,&#34; Xander searched his memory, &#34;nope, I don't recall a Belial on 'Xena'. Unless he's related to Dahak.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I know of Belial,&#34; Giles muttered. &#34;One of the higher ranking demons in the hierarchy of Hell.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;An arch-duke of Hell,&#34; Anya intoned with dread in her voice. &#34;Lord of the Pit, Author of all Lies, these are his titles.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Y'know, Anya,&#34; Buffy said in an edged voice, &#34;I can't help but wish that you had brought this up sooner.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I wasn't a part of your merry group until after graduation,&#34; Anya explained innocently. Or as innocently as an ex-vengeance demon can get. &#34;By the time I got back together with Xander and joined the Slayerettes, Belial had departed the mortal plane, so I figured that he lost interest in your world. But if you're having flashbacks of him, I would guess that he's coming back.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;But how did you know about him?&#34; Giles asked.</p>

<p>&#34;No demon can hide its true essense from another demon,&#34; Anya said simply. &#34;In fact, once I learned that Belial had set himself up as the principal of your high school I said to myself, 'Self, this looks like home sweet home!'. You see, Belial wants above all else control. Over life, over souls, over all creation.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And Snyder being such a control freak,&#34; Giles added, &#34;he would have been an ideal host for Belial. I always suspected that he knew about Mayor Wilkins, and about Buffy.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Oh God, this almost makes sense,&#34; Joyce breathed. &#34;That miserable troll set out from day one to make Buffy miserable. Unfair punishments, intimidation, expulsion, he did everything he could against my little girl.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Mom, please,&#34; Buffy and Alt-Buffy said in unison, then looked at each other, embarrased that they spoke that way. Xander looked at the two and quipped, &#34;You knew that was going to happen.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Joyce has a point,&#34; Giles conceded. &#34;That evolutionary throw-back always seemed to have a vendetta against Buffy. Anyway, what matters is, if Belial is behind all this, we may be facing a grave crisis. Buffy,&#34; he spoke to the younger Slayer, &#34;you were planning a patrol, right?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I was going to stake out Whetherly Park,&#34; Buffy answered, then amended her reply; &#34;No pun intended. Perhaps I should go by where the high school was instead?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;That's where the visions seem to be leading us,&#34; Giles answered. &#34;Besides, the Hellmouth is at its weakest over the old school grounds, and that's where you,&#34; he pointed to Alt-Buffy, &#34;saw the fire display.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'd better go with Buffy,&#34; Alt-Buffy suddenly volunteered.</p>

<p>Giles thought about it, then said, &#34;Perhaps you're right. The two of you can guard each other's backs. Willow and I will do the research. Xander, Anya, stay with Willow, do what she asks. I'll be at the campus library.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You have a computer, Mrs. Summers?&#34; Willow asked.</p>

<p>&#34;I have a good laptop, with a reasonably fast modem,&#34; Joyce went to her study to locate the computer.</p>
<p>Soon, the Scoobs set out on their seperate errands. The two Buffies on patrol, Willow as Research Girl and Giles in the library stacks.&#34; Xander, Anya and Joyce stood by pensively, assured of only one thing; if Belial was their enemy, then they were in for the fight of their lives.</p>

<p>"Hey, Wills," Buffy's voice called over the cell-phone she carried on her patrol. From the
light tone, Willow imagined that it was her Buffy, the one with both the arms she was born
with. "Buffy and Buffy reporting in as scheduled."</p>

<p>"Hey back, Buff," Willow answered on her own cell-phone. She had the prescience to carry
hers with her, which became their primary link with the patrolling Slayers, since Mrs.
Summers' phone would be tied up with Willow's websurfing. "Any signs of skanky evil?"</p>

<p>"Quiet as an audience at a Xander Harris standup routine," Buffy answered. From "We've
been heading toward the old schoolgrounds, and turned up nada. The closest we got was a
pair of goths at the corner of Swanson and Perry. They matched the vampire profile so we
trailed them for a few blocks, only to see them duck into The Old Spaghetti Factory on
Sutherland."</p>

<p>"So?" Willow asked. "Maybe they're Italian vampires?"</p>

<p>"Will, remember when I treated you to dinner at the Spaghetti Factory for your birthday, and
you said you liked the food, but it had a little too much--" she paused for a beat, waiting for
Willow to supply the end of her sentence.</p>

<p>Willow complied, amazed that she had overlooked the obvious. "Garlic, of course. My
bad."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it. How's Research Girl?"</p>

<p>"Currently, more like Stuck-In-Download-Hell Girl. Your mom's laptop doesn't have quite
the speed of my computer at the dorm. I'm trying to hack into Snyder's personal records,
trying to find some connection with this Belial whatever. So far, the encryptions are pretty
tough."</p>

<p>"If anyone can do it, it's my favorite Wiccan-slash-hacker."</p>

<p>"And how many other Wiccan-slash-hackers do you know, Slaygirl?"</p>

<p>"Love you, Wills," Buffy smiled slightly at the teasing tone in her friend's voice. "I'll call back
at the half-hour. Bye."</p>

<p>"Bye, Buff," Willow hung up her cell-phone and tried to concentrate on the screen. <i>'Love
you, Wills,' she had said. If only...</i></p>

<p>"Hey, how's the research?" Joyce's greeting interrupted the young witch's wandering
thoughts. The voice, along with sweet baking smells, drew her attention.</p>

<p>"Slow and steady," Willow answered. </p>

<p>"Here," Joyce put a plate beside the computer. "I baked some chocolate chip cookies."</p>

<p>"Wow, that was fast," Willow commented as she reached for a cookie.</p>

<p>"Actually, it was store-bought cookie dough. I just thought that you could use a break from
staring at the computer screen." Joyce glanced at the screen herself and asked, "What are
you looking for in particular?"</p>

<p>"I'm waiting for a download from a high school in Spokane, Washington," Willow answered
as she nibbled on her cookie. "Apparently Mr. Snyder's last known position before
transferring to Sunnydale. It may take a while. Don't worry though, the web server's a local
call. No phone bills."</p>

<p>"Willow," Joyce sat beside Willow as she spoke in a comforting tone, "my daughter is out
there putting her life on the line on a regular basis. If it will help her, I'm not going to fret over
phone bills." Willow smiled at Joyce's assurances. She remembered how hard Buffy's
mother had taken it when she learned about her daughter being a slayer. Her initial reaction
had been to practically kick her out of the house. Since then, she had made her peace with
Buffy's life. Willow knew that Joyce would never be fully comfortable with Buffy's calling,
but she at least understood it a little better now.</p>

<p>"Willow," Joyce started, then stopped. She was afraid of the question she knew she had to
ask. She munched on a cookie for courage, took a deep breath and started again. "Willow,
there's something I need to ask you. About Buffy."</p>

<p>"Fire away," Willow said absently, as she took a bite of her cookie.</p>

<p>"How long have you been in love with her?"</p>

<p>Instantly a shower of half-chewed cookie bits was expelled over the laptop screen by the
force of Willow's spit take. Willow immediately fretted, rubbing the sleeve of her sweater
over the screen. "Ohmigod, Geez, Mrs. Summers, I'm sorry, I'll just clean this up, get some
gayper-PAPER towels, we'll get this straigtened out, just like me and Buffy. Straight. Yep,
that's us, straight as the Nile, except for that crooked bit where it branches off into the delta,
oh God, help me, I'm trapped in a recursive babble loop."</p>

<p>Joyce placed her hand on Willow's, offering her support, while at the same time, fighting the
urge to giggle at her display. "It's okay, Willow. Xander and Anya are in the next room,
AND THEY HAD BETTER BE FULLY CLOTHED," she raised her voice and craned her
neck toward the hallway, setting off a distant thud of someone falling off a couch, "and I
promise that anything you say won't leave this room."</p>

<p>Willow looked at her hands, the computer screen, a particulary interesting corner in the
room, anything but Joyce's face. She was surprised, not only that Joyce knew the depth of
her feelings for Buffy, but also that she seemed cool with it. "Well, Mrs. Summers," she
stammered meekly, "we met in our sophmore year in high school, which was three years ago,
so I guess the answer would be," she finally looked Joyce in the eye, "pretty much all of my
life. Just how did you figure it out?"</p>

<p>"Well, seeing my daughter's counterpart kiss you when she came too was a big hint," Joyce
admitted.</p>

<p>"Hey," Willow protested. "I didn't start that kiss."</p>

<p>"You didn't stop it either," Joyce teased. "Hey, I'm not mad at you about it, nor would I be
mad at Buffy if she announced that she loved you. Or, judging by Alt-Buffy's performance, I
should say when she announces it. A mother knows these things, even one as seemingly
oblivious as myself." She patted Willow's knee. "It was some kiss, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Willow admitted. "Remember in 'The Princess Bride' when Buttercup pushed The
Dread Pirate Roberts down the hill, and he shouts out 'As you wish', and she realizes that
The Dread Pirate Roberts is really Wesley, and she follows after him, and they kiss each
other?" She illustrated her babbling with rapidly waving hand gestures, then self-conciously
stopped and put her hands in her lap. "Well, it was definitely in that catagory of kiss." She
grinned at the illicit memory. "But Buffy--your Buffy, the two armed one, she hasn't said
anything to me, and I don't think I can tell her. I don't want to screw up our being best
friends. Besides, I wouldn't want you to kick her out of the house or anything like that."</p>

<p>"Willow," Joyce half-laughed, "I made that mistake when she dropped the Slayer bombshell
on me. Not the highlight in my career as a mother. Don't worry, I won't judge you, and I
won't interfere, except to say this." Joyce turned Willow's face to face her own. Her voice
became soft, hushed, as she expressed her deepest mother's heart to Willow. "From the day
when Buffy first told me she was a vampire slayer, my greatest fear for her was that she
would die young and alone. That no one would ever understand who and what she was and
that no one would ever love her or want to make a life together with her. Obviously, there is
such a person, who also happens to be a pretty wonderful young woman herself, and anyone
would be lucky to have that woman love her. If you are the one who can make her happy,
and if she wants you to be that one, I can't think of a thing that could please me more." She
stood up, smiled at Willow and finished, "And in the immortal words of Forrest Gump, 'that's
all I have to say about that'."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Mrs. Summers," Willow wiped back a tear as she turned to the screen. "Uh, about
those paper towels..."</p>

<p>"I'll get them," Joyce answered, breaking the spell of bonding that had occured between the
two women. Willow turned back to the screen, just as the download was completed. She
somehow felt less like a freak for being in live with her best friend. And Buffy's mother was
okay with it. Wow.</p>

<p>With those thoughts in her head, she unzipped the files and, once the screen was wiped of
cookie crumbs, started to read.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>It had become a running gag around the Scooby Gang that Rupert Giles was a notorious
technophobe. Willow had on occasion called him a Neo-Luddite, and Buffy once exclaimed
that he would have told Gutenberg not to rock the boat with that movable type press of his.
While it was true that most of his experiences with computers were spectular failures, Giles
refused to give in to the continual jibes that he was accosted with by the Slayerettes. The fact
was that he had rather prefered the printed page to the electronic age. As far as Giles was
concerned, a simple, portable book was worth all the e-mail and web sites that the proposed
paperless society promised.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he was glad that Willow was so well versed in computer hacking; the
information that she could discover had often spelled the difference between victory and
defeat. At this time, she was looking for files on Mr. Snyder while he looked for anything
concerning Belial. Once again, he was amazed at the amount of arcane lore and esoteric
knowledge he had been able to dig up at the UC Sunnydale campus library. Presumably the
result of Sunnydale being governed for most of its history by one immortal man obsessed with
becoming all powerful, even over the corpses of those whom he governed. Any unholy
information he could discover to further his own warped goals.</p>

<p>Once he had navigated through the computerized card file(a far less painful process than he
had anticipated) he located the corresponding texts. Several books that hadn't been opened
in years, some, Giles would have wagered, not opened during his lifetime, were strewn over
the table where Giles was reading. The first two books yielded nothing that Giles hadn't
known; Beliel, like the classic Satan or Lucifer, was a powerful demon, but one of subtlety
and finesse. Preferring to do his mischief through underlings and unwitting dupes, Belial
would tempt certain people, particularly those who desired control above all else, and
promise them control. In the end, however, it was Belial who would control his victims, who
gladly signed away their souls, only to lose all that they desired. They became no more than
puppets for the demon master Belial.</p>

<p>The book he was reading now, the title translated into "The Codex of Taliesin the Lesser",
was a particularly rare book, and had seldom left its space on the shelves; the spine protested
with creaks and groans as Giles opened it, indicating that it hadn't been opened for nearly a
century. The book written by a medieval mage, circa the first half of the 14th century, who
fancied himself the incarnation of Taliesin, alias Merlin, the mentor of England's legendary
King Arthur. Giles scoffed at the author's assertations, which seemed to color the content of
the book, but his knowledge of Belial's ways had proven more enlightening than anything he
had read before this. He came upon one page, covered with ornate Celtic knotwork designs
and entangled animal and human forms, framing a text. The text was written in one of the
more archaic uncial forms of the Celtic language, one with which Giles had to struggle mightily
to completely translate. Once he did, the finished paragraph chilled his bones to the marrow;</p>

<p><i>"These be the words of Taliesin the lesser
The words you needs must read and ponder in your heart,
Unwise be he who would dice with Belial on such a night as this;
In the final days before the closing of the Thousand Years,
Will Belial come to one who seeks to govern all.
A deal will be made, one which shall seal the doom of all men,
Unless the Chosen One and those who follow her
Do battle with Belial--
Two Chosen shall face Belial and
Shall one only remain."</i></p>

<p>The implications practically jumped off the page and shouted at Giles. "The closing of the
Thousand Years" clearly meant the end of the millenium, which was indeed near. Although
the millenium didn't actually end until December 31, 2000, the prophesy made sense, it
clearly alluded to the present day. Likewise, "the Chosen One" was obvious to Giles; the
Chosen One, the Slayer, Buffy. "And those who would follow her"; the Scooby Gang.</p>

<p>Finally, "two chosen". Two slayers. Buffy and her counterpart from the future. "Shall one
only remain". He didn't pretend to understand time travel, but he had enjoyed the adventures
of "Doctor Who" as a child in his native London. It made sense that the displaced slayer,
once she had changed her timeline, would cease to exist. But what if he was wrong?</p>

<p>He wrote down the translations of the pertinent texts, and left the library for the Summers
residence. Armed with this new information, he hoped that he could shed some light on
Belial's plan, before it was too late for Buffy. Either Buffy.</p>

<p>He was already worried about Alt-Buffy. It was clear from her initial display, hugging her
friends and family fiercly, so that even with one arm she could squeeze the wind out of his
lungs with her embrace. And her desperate apologies to Willow. Why Willow? Giles had
been keenly aware of the depth of friendship between the Slayer and the Hacker, and while it
bothered him that Buffy's calling had exposed Willow, along with the other Slayerettes, to a
great many dangers, he came to realize that she owed her continued existence and her
success as this generation's Slayer to those bonds. Where the Watcher's Council believed
that such bonds were a fatal weakness, Buffy had made them her strength.</p>

<p>But this older Buffy, she had lost those bonds, as her loved ones were turned. She clearly
blamed herself for her world's demise, just as the Buffy he knew blamed herself for taking
Angel's soul with her act of love, leaving behind the vile Angelus. All the pain and misery
Angelus caused, from murdering Jenny Calendar and Kendra to the summoning of Acaltha
and the near death of Willow herself, Buffy had hoisted upon her shoulders like Atlas carrying
the heavens. No wonder she ran away to LA after Angelus' death. Her counterpart,
however, felt an even greater guilt, and Giles was worried that she would do whatever it
takes to stop it. Up to and including sacrificing her own life. </p>

<p>He only hoped that she wouldn't end up sacrificing all she loved in the process.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>The two Buffies strode quietly through the clear Sunnydale night, their almost supernatural
senses attuned to any undead or demonic traces around them. So far, their patrol had been
quiet. This disturbed them both; if the vampires weren't out and about, then it was likely that
they were gathering their strength and their numbers. </p>

<p>Buffy looked at her older counterpart, and tried to read her expression. She seemed wary,
always looking around like a cat at night. Simple Slayer behavior on patrol, she thought, but
there was something else. Some form of energy, a coiled spring wating to be released. The
older Buffy looked at her sibling and asked, "Something you want to share?"</p>

<p>"No, not really," Buffy answered. "Just trying to figure you out. You're so much like me, yet
not. I guess I find it kinda freaky."</p>

<p>"Hey," Alt-Buffy answered, hiking up her tote bag to keep if from throwing her weight off
balance. "I'm the one from out of town, this isn't exactly Normalsville for me either."</p>

<p>"How does it feel?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>The older Buffy shook her head, trying to explain what she could barely grasp. "I feel that
this is what my entire life as a slayer was building up to. Like win or lose, it's my last battle.
In fact, I know it's my last battle; from my contact with the Scepter of Hermes," she patted
the side of her bag with her hand, indicating that she still carried the scepter with her, "once
we whup Belial's ass, I have to cast a final spell. Otherwise, all my changing history will be
for nothing. Kinda like the when I wrote that ten page essay on King Lear..."</p>

<p>"...and forgot to hit 'save' and the whole thing was erased before I could print it for class,"
Buffy finished for her. "God that was a bitch." The slayers laughed together at the shared
memory. The younger Buffy then fixed her gaze on her twin, as she asked, "But doesn't it
bother you knowing that one way or another, this is it? I mean, you change everything, you
stop being--man, trying to think like this is making my hair hurt! You'll simply stop existing?"</p>

<p>"But I'm not," Alt-Buffy tried to explain to the other Slayer. "I'm simply erasing a part of my
life that never should have happened. I'll still go on, because you're me. You're alive, so I'll
be alive. And the others will be alive. Mom, Giles, Willow, the gang, they'll be alive!"</p>

<p>"Uh, that sorta kinda brings me to my next issue," Buffy said. "What's with you and Willow?
I mean, that was some serious smoochies back there."</p>

<p>Alt-Buffy looked at her with a slight smile playing on her battle-scarred face. "I love her.
Always have. As you know."</p>

<p>Buffy stepped back from her partner as though she were thrown off by an electrical field.
"Whoa, time out, instant replay, be kind, rewind! Love? As in, Angel was right about
Vamp-Willow? She is kinda gay?"</p>

<p>Alt-Buffy rolled her eyes at her younger self's outburst. "The hammer lands on the knee and
the foot rises into the air. Buffy, look at me. This is not just someone who knows what it is
to be you, this is you. And you know in your heart that what I'm saying is true. You saw the
shy looks she's been giving you since she lost Oz, the way she got over-protective when you
first started noticing Riley. She loves you. And you love her." </p>

<p>She turned her face away for a second, then screwed her courage to face Buffy again. A
glistening tear tracked its way down her cheek. "I know you do, because I am you. And I
love Willow. She's my center, my source of strength. It destroyed me when I had to stake
her, because she was as much the reason why I kept fighting the good fight as any. It was
always her, not Angel, not Riley. It took me too long to realize that. Please, Buffy, don't let
your chance slip away. She loves you so much.</p>

<p>"She's your salvation, Buffy. She's the light in your life. Don't let that light go out. You won't
be able to survive the darkness that would follow."</p>

<p>Buffy tried to speak, to rebut her twin's charges, but the words wouldn't leave her throat.
Somehow, slowly, Alt-Buffy's words sunk in, and with them the realization that her life,
whether they won or lost tonight, would never be the same. Buffy looked back at those
same hazel eyes that greeted her in the mirror, only older and wizer, and realized that she was
telling the truth. Her entire world, her heart, her soul, her strength, her whole purpose in life
became distilled into three simple words; Willow loved her.</p>

<p>And she returned that love.</p>

<p>"This reminds me of a Dylan Thomas poem I was reading the other week in my Lit class,"
Buffy recalled. She started to recite the first lines; " 'Do not go gentle into that good night...' "</p>

<p>" 'Old age should burn and rave at close of day;'," her twin concluded, and the two of them
finished the stanza together; " 'Rage, rage against the dying of the light'."</p>

<p>This revelation about her and Willow hit like a body blow, and she had to back up to
recollect her scattered thoughts. "Whoa," she whispered. "Look, I just gotta get used to
having this running around my head. I mean, I never considered myself gay or anything, but
now..."</p>

<p>"You're not gay," her older self consoled her, "you're just in love with Willow. It's not about
what tickles you below the beltway, it's about who is your other half."</p>

<p>Just hearing her other self say these words, Buffy realized that she was hearing nothing that
she didn't already know intuitively. "Yeah, I guess that helps when you put it that way, Buffy.
I'm going to have to talk to her once this party's over. Thanks."</p>

<p>"Hey, what are alternate future counterparts for, if not...shh!" She dug her hand into her
duffle bag, fishing out Mr. Pointy. "Undead skanky evil at eleven and three o'clock."</p>

<p>The warning was unnecessary. Both Buffies stood back to back, their stakes in hand, their
bodies as tightly wound steel springs ready to be unleashed. "It's a dead man's party," Alt-
Buffy commented.</p>

<p>"Who could ask for more?" her younger self finished the thought. Low howls could be heard
behind the bushes and trees around them. The two Slayers stood poised, ready for any
attack.</p>

<p>As one, a small army of vampires lunged out of the darkness, fingers bent into claws, fangs
bared, ready for the kill. Buffy high-kicked her first attacker, and lunged her stake into its
heart in half a second, then worked her way through the growing mass of undead. A simple
methodical pattern goverened her movements; kick, stake, repeat. "Yo," Buffy called to her
partner. "How you doing?"</p>

<p>"Good enough," Alt-Buffy answered. "Mostly newbies, foot soldiers."</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy added, "but who's their general?"</p>

<p>Before she could continue that thought, a vampire got close enough to slam his fist against the
back of her neck. Suddenly they were all over her. She struggled against the horde, but their
sheer numbers overwhelmed her. "Buffy!" she screamed, "get out of here! Don't let them
take us both! Call Giles and the Scoobs, have them--" Another sledgehammer fist ended that
sentence as Buffy was knocked unconcious. Alt-Buffy broke away from the crowd of
vampires, staking as many as she could, before diving behind a bush, preparing her escape.</p>

<p>Before the vampires could pursue her, a car pulled out in front of them. From her vantage
point, Alt-Buffy was able to see only a little of what was going on. She saw someone step
out of the car, and address the vampires. "Don't kill her," he demanded. "I want her alive.
To witness what her rebellion against the Watcher's Council has brought her. And throw that
bag aside. We don't want her to have access to her weapons."</p>

<p>Alt-Buffy was stunned as she heard that voice. The voice of the one human she hated as
blackly as any vampire. The man who forced her mentor Giles to betray her, for the sake of
some Slayer's test that nearly killed her and her mother. The man who expelled Giles from
the Watcher's Council for the unforgivable crime of caring about his Slayer.</p>

<p>Quentin Travers.</p>

<p>Quentin ordered the vampires to drag Buffy into the trunk of his car, and then said, "Well
done. Now, meet me at the remains of Sunnydale High School. And no midnight snacks
along the way. When this is over, there will be plenty of blood for all of you, and no slayer to
get in the way. Now go!" He spoke with authority, and the vampires followed. Clearly he
was their general. </p>

<p>After the car pulled away, Alt-Buffy gingerly stepped out from behind the bush, disbelieving
what she saw. Quentin Travers, head of the Watcher's Council, working with vampires? He
had betrayed the council, and now was planning to punish Buffy for her desertion of the
Council. He had to be behind the destruction that she had witnessed first-hand. He was
making a bargain with Belial and mankind's future would be forfeit.</p>

<p><i>Not on my watch!</i> she thought grimly.</p>

<p>She ran to the discarded duffle bag, and checked its contents. She found the cellular, still
whole despite the impact with the street. Buffy placed the phone on the ground, and started
to dial with her one good hand. She prayed that she could reach Giles and the Scooby Gang
in time.</p>

<hr width=100>

<p>Giles had returned to Joyce Summers' house with the information he had gathered from the
library. He was now comparing notes with what Willow had discovered while hacking.
"Here we are, guys," Willow announced as Joyce, Giles, Xander and Anya peered over her
shoulder at the laptop monitor. "I think I've found the connection between Snyder and
Belial."</p>

<p>"They're both scuzzbags?" Xander guessed. Anya slapped him on the arm, indicating that it
was time to serious up.</p>

<p>"According to this file," Willow continued, "Roland Snyder was the principal of Shadle Park
High School in Spokane Washington for three years, before his resignation. That was his last
recorded position before his tenure as principal of Sunnydale, otherwise known as the Reign
of Terror. He was honored by the local school district for his compassionate leadership, and
his willingness to work long and hard with the students and teachers to excell."</p>

<p>"Well," Xander piped in, "you obviously have the wrong file." Giles nodded her head,
adding, "I have to agree with Xander. The Snyder I remember didn't care whether his
students lived or died."</p>

<p>"I thought I took a wrong turn too," Willow admitted, "but look at this picture." She pulled
down a jpeg picture of a man posing with the football team, proudly wearing the green and
gold of the Shadle Park Highlanders. "Yep, that's Snyder," Joyce announced, "I'd know that
ferret face anywhere."</p>

<p>"But it's not Belial," said Anya. "Even from a photo, I'd be able to sense Belial's presence in
a human host."</p>

<p>"Well, according to this file," Willow continued, "just before he left Shadle Park, he was
mugged and severely beaten by three members of the football squad that he was forced to
expel for repeated steroid abuse. Just after their expulsion they ganged up on him, and beat
the dog snot out of him. He left Shadle two days later, and their vice-principal had to take
over. He fell off the map for three years after that, until he showed up at Sunnydale."</p>

<p>"Yes," Anya admitted, "that would be when Belial took over. When Snyder was mugged, he
must have felt as though he had lost control. That's when Belial strikes. He offered him
control, but ended up in control."</p>

<p>"And that's just what Mayor Wilkins wanted from his principal," Giles added. "That's why he
was hired after Rob Flutie died. And so from a caring compassionate admistrater... "</p>

<p>"He became that smirking, locker searching, test fixing, Buffy expelling creepozoidus rex we
all know and wish we didn't." Xander finished Giles' sentence.</p>

<p>"But why did the mayor eat him at graduation when he became a demon dragon?" Joyce
asked.</p>

<p>"Maybe because he became aware of Belial's plans," Anya answered. "Belial's a subtle one.
He was probably waiting for Wilkins to finish his Ascension, then wrest the power he would
wield away from him. One thing a demon hates is competition from another demon."</p>

<p>"So Bill Gates is a demon?" Willow asked innocently. Giles started to refute her
observation, but found himself thinking about it.</p>

<p>Then the phone rang. Giles grabbed the cell-phone and anwered. "Summers residence."</p>

<p>"Giles! It's Buffy--the other Buffy."</p>

<p>"What is it, Buffy?" Giles could hear the tension in her voice.</p>

<p>"Vampires got her. A whole army of them. Quentin's giving the orders, they--"</p>

<p>"Hold it. Quentin? Quentin Travers?"</p>

<p>"No, Quentin Tarantino!" she shouted. "Of course Quentin Travers! He said something
about punishing her for turning her back on the Watchers' Council! They're holding her at the
site of Sunnydale High. Round up the posse, I'm heading that way, I'll meet you there." Giles
heard a click, and the line was disconnected.</p>

<p>Giles was suddenly a flurry of activity. "Buffy's been taken. Quentin Travers is behind it.
And if the prophesy of Taliesin the Lesser is correct, he'll be making a deal with Belial, that
will lead to what the older Buffy lived through."</p>

<p>"So we meet Buffy of Future Past at the school and kick vampire ass! Let's go!" Xander
headed out the door, followed by Giles and Anya. </p>

<p>Willow turned toward Joyce and said, "Don't worry, Mrs. Summers, we'll bring her back,
and stop all this." She gave Joyce a brief, comforting hug, although Joyce knew that the
young woman needed comforting as well. Then Willow followed the Scoobs to Giles' car. </p>

<p>As she sat shotgun alongside Giles, she made a silent prayer to whatever God or Goddess
was listening; <i>Please, let me be strong enough and fast enough to save the one I love.</i></p>
