<!-- Sappho's Scroll \ Epiogue 1 -->

<p>A raven-haired beauty stood before the
alter of Aphrodite, declaring, "Oh great Aphrodite,
Perfection among women, Beauty of the
world, Faultless Goddess of love--"</p>

<p>Said goddess appeared in a cloud of
luminous smoke. "Yeah, yeah, yeah, tell me something
I don't know. So, Saph," the
golden haired goddess asked her petitioner. "How'd you make
out with Gabs?"</p>

<p>"She received the scroll with thanks,
oh Aphrodite," Sappho replied to the goddess, who
was twirling a lock of her hair around
her forefinger.</p>

<p>The Goddess of Love grinned mischievously.
"Oh, goody," she chirped, clapping her hands
with glee. "The show should be
starting now. We can watch it in my scrying pool." They
gathered around a fountain in the temple,
and Aphrodite waved her hand over the clear
waters.</p>

<p>Their reflections in the water faded,
and the image of the proud warrior, naked and
unashamed before her equally naked
bard, filled the pool. The bard trailed long sensuous
kisses along the warrior's shoulders,
the nape of her neck, and finally the slope of her breasts,
as Xena sucked in a sharp breath in
delight at this treatment. "Gotta say, I'm loving the
blonde's technique," Aphrodite giggled.
"Enjoying the show, Sapphy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Aphrodite," the poet breathed.
"Thank you for making me a part of their joining."</p>

<p>"Hey, that's nothing. You wrote
the poem that brought them together, I just gave it the
Aphrodite whammy. I've been a
bitch to those two in the past, I just figured it was time I do
something nice for them. And
considering how bad they got it for each other, I said to
myself, Self, howsabout we get those
two together?"</p>

<p>"But, my Goddess," Sappho asked, "What
will happen when they discover that Gabrielle is
to carry Xena's baby?"</p>

<p>"Those two?" Aphrodite chuckled, "They'll
be great parents. Surely Xena can look after the
kid. And if they start to wonder
who's the daddy, I'll go down and spell it out for them." She
turned toward Sappho, removing the
silver pin that fastened her pelops, letting the garment
drift to the floor, revealing her splendid
nude figure. "You have earned your reward,
Sappho."</p>

<p>"Thank you, oh Aphrodite," Sappho breathed,
lust coloring her cheeks as she slowly
removed her tunic. "I am honored
by your reward to me. Very few humans can say that
they've enjoyed the favors of the Goddess
of Love."</p>

<p>"Hey," Aphrodite winked at Sappho, her
desire matching the poet's, "how many gods can
say that they've been laid by the Tenth
Muse?" The two embodiments of love and passion
embraced and began to make love, even
as the two figures in the scrying pool continued to
love each other.</p>
