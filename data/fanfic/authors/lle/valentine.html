<p>Brooke sighed in exasperation as she threw her wet jacket over the
side of the shower stall. A 2-minute dash from the entrance of
Kennedy High to her car, only to discover that she was completely out
of gas. She had been unable to find a ride, and had to walk the
entire way home in the pouring rain.</p>

<p>"Figures." The disgruntled blonde muttered to herself. "The sky HAS
to open on V-Day. Not that I have anyone to spend it with anyway."</p>

<p align=center>*~*~*~*</p>

<p>The house was empty. Mike and Jane had gone out of town for the
remainder of the week to celebrate Valentine's Day together, dropping
Mac off at Mike's parents house on their way. Sam was still at
school, and probably wouldn't be home for another hour or two. She
had an article to finish for the school newspaper, and the deadline
was at 4 Pm today.</p>

<p>Brooke stripped down to her underwear, and chucked the wet garments
in the clothes dryer. She didn't really feel like putting any dry
clothes on at the moment, so she simply proceeded into the living
room, turned on the radio and, after clicking away from a
few "Special Valentine's Day Broadcast", snuggled up in the couch
with a blanket and this month's issue of Cosmo.</p>

<p>Not many minutes had passed when the blonde suddenly hurled the
magazine across the room in rage. Of course this issue had a huge
Valentine's Day-Section.</p>

<p>"Just what the doctor proscribed." Brooke sighed. "More reminders of
how miserable my life is."</p>

<p>The reason Brooke was so upset was simple enough. She was lonely. For
the first time in her young life, she was alone on the most romantic
day of the year. No boyfriend, no parents, not even a friend to spend
it with. Only a soon-to-be stepsister, and she wasn't even home yet.</p>

<p>Sam, Brooke knew, had no one to spend Valentine's Day with either.
She and George had broken up a few months ago when he, once again,
had been transferred to a new High School, this one in Wisconsin. The
brunette had talked to Brooke about it, and the blonde had learned
that the break-up had been a mutual agreement since both Sam and
George had known that they wouldn't be able to make their
relationship work over such a long distance.</p>

<p>"Achoo!" Brooke sneezed, bolting upright in the couch before sneezing
a second time, and then a third time. (Oh joy! This day just keeps
getting better and better.) She thought sourly as she flopped back
down in the couch and pulled the blanket close around herself.</p>

<p>Ok, maybe spending V-Day with Sam wouldn't be so bad. The two of them
had grown closer. They weren't exactly best friends, but they weren't
constantly at each other's throats anymore either. Sam was actually
sweet, funny and an all-round nice person. In short, she was nothing
like Brooke originally had pictured her to be.</p>

<p>The mere thought of her brunette housemate brought a smile to
Brooke's face. She pondered this for a second, but quickly shrugged
it off again. If thinking of Sam was what it took to make her smile,
then so be it.</p>

<p>As she recalled the delightful sound of Sam's laughter, Brooke soon
drifted off to sleep.</p>

<p align=center>*~*~*~*</p>

<p>Sam stretched her arms above her head and yawned loudly as she moved
her neck to pop a few vertebras back into place. She glanced at her
wristwatch, and smiled as she saw that it was 3:55 Pm. That left her
just enough time to run the spell-checker, print and hand the
finished article over to the editor before the deadline.</p>

<p>A look of sadness crossed the brunette's features as she noticed the
date, which was also visible on the digital watch. February 14th,
Valentine's Day. How could she have forgotten? It wasn't like there
hadn't been any indications. Josh and Lily had been even more mushy
and sugary than usual, and even Nicole had been somewhat civil to
people today.</p>

<p>Sam sighed. (Alone on V-Day. Yipee-kai-yai. Well, better get this
thing handed in and head on home.)</p>

<p>She got up from her chair and stretched one again, smiling as she
felt the exhaustion flow away from her tired limbs. As she waited for
the printer to finish (God, this thing is SO slow!), she found her
mind wandering to what seemed to be its favorite subject as of late:
Brooke. More often than not, the brunette found her brain practically
overflowing with images of her blonde housemate. The reason for these
thoughts had managed to escape her so far, not for a lack of trying
on Sam's part though. She had always just chalked it up to being
happiness over the fact that she and Brooke were actually getting
along, and it fit. Still, she couldn't help feel as if there were
still some pieces of the puzzle missing.</p>

<p>Finally pulling the finished story from the claws of the printer, Sam
glanced out the window. The blue sky was hidden behind a large amount
of dark clouds, and the wind seemed to have increased since classes
ended a few hours ago. (Great. Looks like there's a thunderstorm
brewing.)</p>

<p align=center>*~*~*~*</p>

<p>"Brooke? You home?" Sam called as she shut the door behind her. She
had noticed Brooke's car still parked at the school before she left,
and had gotten slightly worried that something might have happened to
the blonde.</p>

<p>The house was almost eerily dark and quiet, Sam noticed as she pulled
of her jacket and boots. She reached out and flipped the light-
switch, only to find that the power seemed to have gone out.</p>

<p>"Well, this is just perfect." She muttered, heading into the living
room in search of candles.</p>

<p align=center>*~*~*~*</p>

<p>Sam watched as the small flame on the wick of the candle slowly grew
larger, letting its warm glow encircle her. Satisfied that the candle
was properly lit, she picked up the candlestick, sheltering the flame
with her free hand as she walked across the room to the couch.</p>

<p>She placed the candle on the table by the couch and watched it for a
second, fascinated by the colors of the small flame. Sam observed the
shadows dancing across the room, adding to the already cozy
atmosphere created by the soft darkness and the sound of the rain
drumming against the windows.</p>

<p>The brunette turned to walk into the kitchen, and almost had a
seizure when she noticed the sleeping blonde on the couch.</p>

<p>"Decaf McPherson, it's called Decaf." She muttered while leaning
against one of the recliners, trying to get her heart rate back to
normal. (I did not expect seeing her there, looking all cute and
peaceful and…Whoa, cute? Where'd that come from?)</p>

<p>Sam couldn't help the small smile showing on her face as she drank in
the sight of the sleeping blonde. Brooke was lying on her side,
curled up in the fetal position, her arms hugging a corner of the
blanket and a content smile playing at her lips. The blanket had
moved slightly during her sleep, showing a hint of bare shoulders.
(Bare sh…Oh shit! She's not naked under that thing, is she?)</p>

<p>Sam pushed aside the tirade of x-rated images suddenly clouding her
brain and decided to head upstairs. (Cold shower. That's what I need,
a cold shower. Why do I need a cold shower? It's only Brooke for
crying out loud!)</p>

<p align=center>*~*~*~*</p>

<p>//Hmm he he / Oh hey / Doesn't matter (It doesn't matter) / Doesn't
matter at all//</p>

<p>//Doesn't matter what your friends are telling you/ Doesn't matter
what my family's saying too / It just matters that I'm in love with
you / It only matters that you love me too//</p>

<p>//It doesn't matter if they won't accept you / I'm accepting of you
and the things you do / Just as long as it's you / Nobody but you,
baby-baby//</p>

<p align=center>*~*~*~*</p>

<p>Brooke raised her head and looked around. She was sitting on a bench
in a park. A mighty oak tree stood tall behind the bench, providing a
comfortable shadow from the rays of the mid-summer sun shining from
the blue sky above her. The park was vast, stretching as far as the
blonde's eyes could see. Various sorts of hardwood trees were spread
around the grounds, some alone, some in groups.</p>

<p>A small path, covered in white gravel, ran right by the bench on
which Brooke was sitting. Along the sides of the path were two long,
somewhat narrow flowerbeds. A plethora of flowering plants, many of
which the blonde didn't recognize, were planted in the fresh soil.
All kinds of roses, lilies, orchids and every other type of plant you
could ever imagine filled the warm air with the unmistakable scent of
a long summer's night in a floral garden.</p>

<p>The blonde picked up her ears as the soft chatter of her flowing
namesake reached her. Curiosity replaced her initial wonder over her
surroundings, and she decided to take a closer look at the place.
Getting up from the bench, she walked along the small gravel path,
breathing in the sweet air as she walked in the direction of the
sound.</p>

<p>When Brooke finally reached her destination, the sun was setting. Its
last rays were spreading across the scenery, making the water shine
like gold as the light of the sky said a temporary goodbye to the
earth. The blonde looked around and noticed that she was not alone. A
young girl with long brown hair was sitting at the edge of the water,
her bare legs dangling over the brink.</p>

<p>"Hey there." Brooke said as she crouched down next to the child. The
girl raised her head and looked at the blonde with a pair of deep,
innocent brown eyes.</p>

<p>"Why are you out here all alone?" Brooke asked.</p>

<p>"Why are you?" The child responded.</p>

<p>"Because I have no one special to spend today with." Brooke sighed.</p>

<p>"Sit here?" The child said, patting the ground next to herself.</p>

<p>"Thanks." Brooke gave a small smile as she did what the girl asked.</p>

<p>"Can't you find someone? Then you wont be alone." The child inquired,
once again fixing her gaze on the older blonde next to her.</p>

<p>Brooke looked at the child. There was something oddly familiar about
those eyes. The way they seemed to penetrate you and the quiet
vulnerability hidden behind a large amount of strength.</p>

<p>"I don't know where to look." The blonde replied honestly.</p>

<p>"My mommy says you often find something where you least expect it."</p>

<p>"Your mommy sounds like a very smart woman." Brooke smiled.</p>

<p>"She is." The child replied, also smiling. Again, the feeling of
familiarity overcame the blonde. This child reminded her of someone,
only she couldn't quite figure out whom.</p>

<p>"Look." The girl said, pointing to the water. </p>

<p>Brooke turned her gaze towards her namesake and watched as various
images floated past the two of them right before her very eyes.
Images of her and Sam. The first day they met in Kindergarten, their
fights over the years, the day they found out about the engagement of
their parents, the day Sam and Jane moved into the McQueen house,
everything that had happened up until now, including Prom night where
Sam had somehow managed to get both of them out of the way of
Nicole's car.</p>

<p>"A long and winding road." Came a familiar voice. Brooke turned her
head and gaped as she realized whom it was sitting next to her on the
brink.</p>

<p>"Sam?"</p>

<p>"In the flesh Princess." The young woman smiled. She was wearing a
long, white summer dress in a light white fabric. Her long dark
tresses hung loose around her back, a garland of white orchids
adorning the top of her head. She was as beautiful as ever,
breathtaking even.</p>

<p>"Wha…What are you doing here?" Brooke asked, barely able to speak as
she drank in the natural beauty of the other girl.</p>

<p>"Again, I'll answer your question with one of my own." Sam smiled and
leaned back on her arms. "Why are YOU here?"</p>

<p>"And again, I have no one special to share today with." Brooke
replied.</p>

<p>"What am I? Chopped liver?" Sam joked, pouting.</p>

<p>(Oh God, those lips. I could just kiss…Whoa, hold on there McQueen!
Kiss Sam? What the Hell is going on here?)</p>

<p>"If you are, then you are definitely the most breathtaking piece of
chopped liver I have ever seen." (Ok, that came out of nowhere.)</p>

<p>"Why, thank you very much Ms McQueen." Sam grinned and pulled a
strand of dark hair away from her face. "You're not looking half-bad
yourself."</p>

<p>"Thanks." Brooke muttered, blushing slightly. "So, where are we
anyway?"</p>

<p>"Don't know." Sam shrugged. "It's beautiful."</p>

<p>"You don't know? An investigative reporter like you?" Brooke teased.</p>

<p>"Very witty Princess." Sam said, sticking out her tongue at the
blonde. " I don't have all the answers, you know. A fair amount, yes,
but not all of them."</p>

<p>"Glad to hear you're not selling yourself short Sam."</p>

<p>"Oh I'd never do anything as silly as that." The brunette
grinned. "But seriously Brooke." Sam said, suddenly growing
serious. "Who do you want to spend V-Day with?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." Brooke breathed, looking at her hands. "Why do you
care?"</p>

<p>"Ouch, retract your claws feline." Sam frowned. "I care very much
Princess. Whether I like to admit it or not, you've become one of the
most important people in my life. You're my friend Brooke, sometimes
my best friend."</p>

<p>"Thanks Sam, I feel the same way." Brooke smiled slightly at the
admission. "I just think…"</p>

<p>"Brooke." Sam interrupted. "Listen carefully to what I'm about to
say, chances are you might never hear me say it again. Sometimes you
can't think too much about things. You just have to find out what you
want in your heart of hearts, find out what FEELS right instead of
what makes sense."</p>

<p>"Sounds like good advice." The blonde smiled after a few minutes of
thinking.</p>

<p>"Hey, have I ever steered you wrong in the past?" At Brooke's
incredulous look, the brunette quickly added. "When I didn't mean to,
that is."</p>

<p>"Guess not." The blonde replied. "But I don't know what I want."</p>

<p>"Then we'll figure it out." Sam smiled and took hold of Brooke hand
with her own. "Together."</p>

<p>Brooke looked at their joined hands and smiled. It felt familiar, and
it felt right. "Together." She parroted silently. "I like how that
sounds."</p>

<p align=center>*~*~*~*</p>

<p>A loud clash of thunder erupted, causing the brunette to jump
slightly as she came out of the bathroom. (Man, that one was big.
Calm down Sam, calm down. It's only thunder.)</p>

<p>She proceeded down the stairs, a pensive frown on her face as she
pondered her latest revelation. (Ok, so I'm gay. So what? Doesn't
change who I am, right? Not like it's something I can change anyway.)</p>

<p>Sam's unconscious had been trying to alert her of the fact that her
desires did not lie with the male half of the population for some
time now. More specifically, since she was forced to share a house
and a bathroom with a certain blonde cheerleader. She had been lying
in the bathtub for the better part of an hour, thinking hard to make
sure that it was true. After all, discovering that you can't take the
road most traveled is never an easy epiphany at the very beginning.
It was tempting to just ignore that stubborn little inner voice
telling her what she knew was true. But, Sam decided, this wasn't
something you could just shut out. If she was ever to be truly happy
with her life, she had to accept who she was. The brunette had
admitted it to herself, and she already felt more free and refreshed
than she had felt in a very long time.</p>

<p>(That was the easy part.) She thought with a sarcastic smirk. (How
the Hell am I supposed to tell Brooke that I'm madly on love with
her?)</p>

<p>It had indeed been a very productive afternoon for the mind of
Samantha McPherson. Not many brains can brag about the fact that they
have made their owners recognize two facts on the same day.
Especially not when they have been trying to ignore said facts for
more than two years.</p>

<p>As she re-entered the living room, Sam's gaze once more fell upon the
sleeping blonde on the couch. (Cute? Nah, beautiful is more like it.)</p>

<p>With a sigh, Sam sat down on the floor across from the couch and
leaned against one of the recliners as she watched the girl sleep.
(I'll tell her when she wakes up. Please God; if she can't love me
back at least don't let her hate me.)</p>

<p align=center>*~*~*~*</p>

<p>//(You're so kind) / Just what I asked for, you're so loving and
kind / (And you're mine) / And I can't believe you're mine//</p>

<p>//Doesn't matter if you're feeling insecure / Doesn't matter if
you're feeling so unsure / Cause I'll take away the doubt within your

<p>//Doesn't matter what the pain we go through / Doesn't matter if the
money's gone too / Just as long as I'm with you / Nobody but you,
baby, baby//</p>

<p align=center>*~*~*~*</p>

<p>Brooke bolted upright in the couch as another loud clash of thunder
filled the room. Panting, she slowly let the last part of the dream
replay in front of her inner eye.</p>

<p>[She was lying with her head in Sam's lap, watching the stars in the
sky above them while enjoying the soft feel of the brunette's fingers
playing with her hair. Exactly when the last light of day had
disappeared and nighttime had set in she didn't know, she didn't
really care either. The air was still warm, and it felt good being
close to Sam.</p>

<p>(What DO I want?) Brooke sighed and looked at the constellations in
the sky. She didn't remember their names, but they were beautiful
nonetheless. A small voice was yelling in her head, trying
desperately to be heard. One part of the blonde's brain was pressing
to make it's owner hear what was being told her, but another part was
pressing just as hard to keep the message buried in the subconscious
where it felt this particular feeling belonged.</p>

<p>"Penny for `em?" Sam asked, softly tracing the frown on the blonde's
face with an index finger.</p>

<p>Brooke closed her eyes and shook her head in exasperation. "I don't
understand. It's like... I'm trying to feel, like you told me to. And
there is a feeling inside me. But it's like…like some part of me wont
let me see it. Like it's afraid of what will happen once it surfaces.
Am I making any sense?"</p>

<p>"A lot of sense actually." Sam said, her gaze following her own
finger as it moved from the blonde's eyebrows to her cheekbone. "
Sounds like you do know who you want, you're just too afraid to
realize it for some reason. Afraid of having things with this person
change, afraid of their reaction."</p>

<p>"But who is it?" Brooke groaned. "God, this is frustrating!"</p>

<p>Sam freed herself from the blonde and lay down on the ground. Brooke
was lying on her back with her legs over the brink, while Sam was
lying on her stomach, her body following the line of the water and
her head towards the blonde. The brunette placed her head in her
hands and looked at the face beneath her own with a thoughtful
expression.</p>

<p>"Close your eyes." She said as-a-matter-of-factly, looking into the
cheerleader's hazel pools.</p>

<p>"What?" Brooke asked in confusion.</p>

<p>"Close. Your. Eyes." Sam replied patiently. Satisfied that the blonde
was following her instructions, she continued. "Think of love, relax
and let the emotion fill you up. Then tell me who you see."</p>

<p>After a few minutes of silence, Brooke opened her eyes once more. She
looked at Sam's face in wonder, as if she was seeing it for the very
first time.</p>

<p>"Who did you see?" Sam asked, twirling a lock of blonde hair between
her fingers.</p>

<p>"You." Brooke said, awe in her voice.</p>

<p>"Don't look so surprised Princess." Sam grinned and traced the
blonde's lips with her thumb. " I am pretty irresistible, wouldn't
you say?"</p>

<p>"Breathtaking." Brooke agreed, closing her eyes as Sam's gentle
fingers drew patterns on the side of her neck.</p>

<p>"Flattery will get you everywhere." Sam smiled and leaned in closer.]</p>

<p>(Oh my God! I'm in love with Sam? I'm in love with Sam. Ok, so noted.
What do I do? Tell her, you idiot. But what if she doesn't feel the
same way? You wont know unless you ask. Argh, I hate internal
arguments.)</p>

<p>Brooke was so caught up in the debate currently taking place in her
head that she didn't even notice the brunette until she was sitting
right beside her.</p>

<p>"Brooke?"</p>

<p>"Hm? Oh, Sam hi. Er…What?"</p>

<p>"I need to talk to you."</p>

<p align=center>*~*~*~*</p>

<p>//You're love for me, unconditional I see / Gotta get up, get up /
Get up, get up, get up and show you that it...//</p>

<p align=center>*~*~*~*</p>

<p>"I've only just realized it, but I guess I've been feeling this way
for quite a while." Sam began, finding her bracelet very interesting
all of a sudden. </p>

<p>"Feeling? What feeling?" Brooke asked. (Maybe...Oh get real McQueen,
wishful thinking.)</p>

<p>"Brooke, I'm gay." Sam blurted out. (Ok, one down, one to go. Please
give me a positive reaction.)</p>

<p>"Uh…Um…" Brooke stuttered, temporarily stupefied. (English Brooke,
English. Say something.)</p>

<p>"Brooke?" Sam asked, misty brown eyes desperately searching hazel
ones for a reaction. "Princess talk to me, please?"</p>

<p>"Sorry." Brooke shook her head and smiled. "Just kinda caught me off
guard there, you know?"</p>

<p>"Yeah." Sam sniffed. "It's kinda big. Sorry to spring it on you like
this."</p>

<p align=center>*~*~*~*</p>

<p>//(You're so kind) / Just what I asked for, you're so loving and
kind / (And you're mine) / And I can't believe you're mine//</p>

<p>//Doesn't matter what they say / Cause you know I'm gonna love you
anyway / Doesn't matter what they do / Cause my love will always be
with you//</p>

<p align=center>*~*~*~*</p>

<p>"Aw Sammy. Don't cry. Come here." Brooke said, reaching out for the
brunette to join her on the couch.</p>

<p>Sam hesitantly took Brooke's hands and sat down next to her, closing
her eyes as she sank into the blonde's embrace. (God, I can't believe
how good she smells.)</p>

<p>"Sam, you being gay doesn't change anything between us, I hope you
know that." Brooke said while gently stroking the brunette's back (I
wish.)</p>

<p>"But it does Brooke." Sam said, almost desperately. "It changes
everything. I have to tell you one more thing."</p>

<p>"Anything Sammy. Don't worry; nothing you can do or say will make you
any less worth in my opinion. You'll still be the same pigheaded,
beautiful, obnoxious ass I love so much." Brooke said in a soothing
tone. (Oops, slipped right off of the tip of my tongue.  Well, now's
as good a time as any I guess.)</p>

<p>Sam pulled back slightly, confusion evident on her face. "You love
me? I'm beautiful?"</p>

<p>"I have eyes Sam, I can see." Brooke grinned, blushing
slightly. "Even if I sometimes can't see what's right under my own
nose." She added, lowering her head.</p>

<p>"Like what?" Sam asked. (Please let that be it. Please!)</p>

<p>"Like you." Brooke said so softly the brunette almost missed it,
almost.</p>

<p>"Me?" Sam's brow furrowed in mild confusion. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Brooke raised her head and let her eyes meet Sam's. The love and
concern in the brunette's chocolate pools urged her to continue, so
she did.</p>

<p>"I'm in love with you."</p>

<p>Sam choked a sob at the sound of the honesty and vulnerability in the
admission. Happy tears trailed down her cheeks as she reached over
and stroked the blonde's face with the tips of her fingers.</p>

<p>"You've just said everything I've ever dreamed of hearing Princess."
She whispered. "I love you too."</p>

<p align=center>*~*~*~*</p>

<p>//My love for you unconditional love too / Gotta get up, get up / Get
up, get up, get up and show you that / My love is true, and it's just
for you, uh//</p>

<p>//Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing / Cause I'm in love
with the inner being / And it doesn't really matter what they
believe / What matters to me is you're in love with me//</p>

<p>//Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing / Cause I'm in love
with the inner being / And it doesn't really matter what they
believe / What matters to me is you're nutty-nutty-nutty for me//</p>

<p align=center>*~*~*~*</p>

<p>Sam sighed in contentment as she snuggled closer to the blonde beside
her. She couldn't imagine even the softest pillow in the world being
just a tiny bit better than the one person she loved more than life
itself.</p>

<p>"Comfy?" Brooke asked, amused at how the brunette had already claimed
her as her own personal pillow.</p>

<p>"Mmm. Very." Sam smiled, breathing in the blonde's unique scent. "You
smell like blackberries." She added as an afterthought, feeling the
soft vibrations as Brooke's chuckled.</p>

<p>"Why thank you." Brooke smiled and kissed the top of Sam's forehead.
Noticing a broad grin spreading on Sam's face, she caught the
brunette's eyes and sent her a questioning look.</p>

<p>"I was just thinking." Sam smiled and took Brooke's hand in her
own. "Be my Valentine?" She asked in her little-girl voice.</p>

<p>"Always Sammy." Brooke replied, also smiling. "If you'll be mine."</p>

<p>"Anytime Princess, I love you."</p>

<p>"As I love you."</p>

<p align=center>*~*~*~*</p>

<p>//Nutty-nutty-nutty my love for you / I can't believe my dreams come
true / I've finally found somebody whose heart is true / And best of
all you love me to / And nutty-nutty-nutty my love for you / I can't
believe my dreams come true / I've finally found somebody whose heart
is true / And best of all you're nutty-nutty-nutty for me//</p>
