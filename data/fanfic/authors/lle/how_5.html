<!-- How Did It Come to This? \ Part Five -->

<p>Sam held back an impressed gasp as she and Brooke entered the kitchen. The table was tastefully decorated with her and Brooke?s favorite flowers, red tulips and white lilies. A green tablecloth set a lovely background for the white vase with said flowers. Two white candlesticks each held two green candles, which sent a soft golden glow around the room.</p>
<p>"Have a seat." Brooke said, gesturing towards one of the two chairs by the table.</p>
<p>"Thanks." Sam said, looking at the blonde nervously as she did just that. "So, what?s for dinner?"</p>
<p>"Well, it?s not that extraordinary." Brooke replied, giggling awkwardly. "I didn?t really have any time to go to the grocery store, so I just used whatever I could find in the house."</p>
<p>"Not including the rat poison my mom keeps in the sink cabinet, I hope?" Sam asked. She didn?t understand why Brooke was being so nice to her. This was unfamiliar territory, and the brunette wasn?t very comfortable with it.</p>
<p>Brooke quirked an eyebrow and looked at Sam.</p>
<p>"Funny." She said. "I didn?t even know we had any."</p>
<p>"Yeah well, mom always likes to stay ahead of things, you know?" Sam replied, fixating her eyes on the table. "It?s kinda silly." She picked up one of the small golden items, which lay scattered across the table surface. It was a peace sign. Sam smirked and looked at Brooke as she held up the object.</p>
<p>"You?re really serious about this, aren?t you?" She asked.</p>
<p>Brooke nodded and began putting the food onto two separate plates. A slight blush showed in the soft lighting. Sam?s smirk evolved into a small smile as she noticed the embarrassed look on the cheerleader?s face. Brooke stood at the counter, her side towards the brunette as she made the final preparation for their meal. She had pulled her bottom lip in between her teeth and nibbled on it lightly.</p>
<p>Sam stood up and walked over beside the blonde. Brooke was obviously far away in her own thoughts since she hadn?t noticed that she had already placed almost all of the mashed potatoes on the same plate. Sam leaned into Brooke and watched her face intensely.</p>
<p>"Hello?" She said. "Anybody home?" Brooke didn?t reply. In fact, she didn?t even hear Sam. She just continued to nibble her lower lip with a blank look in her hazel eyes. Sam looked at the blonde teenager?s face. What was she thinking about? This was natural, undisguised, and simply not the Brooke she knew. The way her eyes seemed to watch a scene Sam simply couldn?t see, the way her features held a secret emotion deep within them. The brunette leaned in closer to Brooke. She could smell her perfume. It was a new brand, slightly mixed with the cheerleader?s natural scent.</p>
<p>Sam reached out and carefully waved a hand In front of Brooke?s face.</p>
<p>"Helloooo?" She repeated. Brooke jumped and twirled around. The sudden movement startling Sam and making her fall onto her back on the kitchen floor.</p>
<p>"God Sam!" Brooke gasped. "You scared me!"</p>
<p>"Yeah well." Sam said as she got back up on her feet. "Fear always springs from ignorance." She rubbed her backside gently with her hands. "Ouch."</p>
<p>"Say?s who?" Brooke asked.</p>
<p>"Emerson." The brunette stated. "It?s a quotation from "The American Scholar"</p>
<p>"Oh. Glad to see you?ve made use of the book Dad and I gave you for last Christmas." Brooke replied, giggling at the sight of the slightly red-faced reporter.</p>
<p>"This isn?t funny you know." Sam said in an offended tone. "Falling ass-first on a tile-floor is not exactly the most comfortable thing in the world."</p>
<p>"I know." The blonde said, trying hard to suppress another snicker. "But if you could have seen your face..." She left the sentence hanging between them as she opened her eyes wide, gaped and held up her hands to match Sam?s previous expression.</p>
<p>"Ugh. I give up." Sam sighed and sat back down at the table. She noticed the plate Brooke had held earlier and smiled. "Are you going to eat all of that?" She asked, pointing to the enormous amount of mashed potatoes on said plate.</p>
<p>"Ehh...I...No." Brooke quickly turned her attention back to the task at hand and proceeded to divide the food onto two plates</p>
<p>Sam smirked at the look on the blonde cheerleader?s face. The confused/embarrassed expression looked good on Brooke. The way she frowned ever so slightly, and how her lips pouted just a little was indeed a very good look on her. It was sweet, innocent and kind of attractive too.</p>
<p>The brunette clasped a hand over her mouth as if that action would take back her latest thought. Brooke heard the sound and looked at her housemate.</p>
<p>"What?s wrong?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Nothing!" Sam blurted out in a somewhat high-pitched voice. "Nothing at all!"</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>A few hours later Sam turned off the TV and headed upstairs. Passing Brooke?s slightly open bedroom door, she heard the blonde singing softly. The brunette peeked in through the crack and saw Brooke sitting at her desk. The blonde was obviously doing her homework, exactly which class it was Sam couldn?t see. The cheerleader was singing a slow love song, and it rang beautifully through the otherwise quiet house.</p>
<p><i>Without you</i></p>
<p><i>There?s no more air to breathe</i></p>
<p><i>Without you</i></p>
<p><i>I build my whole world</i></p>
<p><i>Around you</i></p>
<p><i>Oh I feel like I?m missing you</i></p>
<p>Sam smiled and knocked on the door. Brooke raised her head and stopped singing.</p>
<p>"Come in." She said as she turned her eyes to the door.</p>
<p>"Hey." Sam smiled as she walked into the room. "What?cha doing?"</p>
<p>"Geography." Brooke sighed and tugged some hair behind her ear. "I hate that class with the fire of a thousand suns."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know how you feel." Sam replied as she came to a halt right beside the seated blonde. "I haven?t finished mine either. Maybe we could do it together? You know, help each other out."</p>
<p>Brooke?s face lit up like that of a 5-year-old on Christmas morning. "Would you?" She asked with a big smile.</p>
<p>"Sure." Sam said, also smiling broadly. "I?ll just go get my books."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Ok, let?s see here." Brooke said as she and Sam both sat cross-legged on the middle of Brooke?s bed. "The chapter on Climate is on page 29."</p>
<p>"And info on fronts would be on page..." Sam paused while checking the register in the back of the book. "Page 39."</p>
<p>Both girls sat in silence for a few minutes while reading the text carefully. Sam silently lifted her head and looked at Brooke. The cheerleader looked absolutely adorable as she sat there in her blue satin pajamas. Her blonde hair was pulled back in a loose ponytail and hung softly around her ears. Sam soon realized that she wasn?t observing Brooke as she had thought. She was watching her, taking in her sleek shoulders, the gentle line at her waist, the focused look on her face and the way she curled her wet, pink lips slightly while she read.</p>
<p>Brooke lifted her head as she felt Sam?s stare. "What?"</p>
<p>"Uh, nothing." Sam replied and quickly turned her eyes to the page in front of her. "Never mind."</p>
<p>The blonde tilted her head and looked at the reporter. Sam was taking notes, as always with her tongue out in her cheek and a slight frown on her face. She was wearing a red v-neck t-shirt and a pair of white boxer shorts. A slight blush had spread across her face and body when Brooke looked at her, turning her chest a tender shade of pink. Brooke?s eyes lingered at Sam?s chest, watching the way it raised and fell calmly with each breath. The blonde nearly leaned over to get a better look down Sam?s t-shirt, but got a grip on herself in the last second. Embarrassed and slightly confused, she also returned to taking notes.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the two girls, they were thinking the exact same things at the exact same time. Both were more than confused about the way their eyes wandered across each other, and neither of them wanted to listen to the small voice that told them the actual reason. There was no way this could really be happening.</p>
