<!-- How Did It Come to This? \ Part Two -->

<p>Brooke walked down the halls, heading for the cafeteria. The look in her eyes was an incoherent mixture of hurt, anger and confusion, the two latter having erupted from the first. She didn?t understand why Sam?s remark concerning her feelings towards the statuette blonde had made her feel this way. She didn?t even like Sam, did she? No, that was impossible. Sam was absolutely; positively the most obnoxious, mort irritating person she had ever had the questionable pleasure of meeting. A tiny voice in the back of Brooke?s head objected strongly to this statement, but she chose to ignore it. She closed her arms tighter around the books she was carrying in front of her. The hurt and the confusion faded away, leaving only the anger. This comforted the cheerleader somewhat. Being angry with her dark-haired housemate was familiar. She could deal with that.</p>
<p>As Brooke reached the cafeteria, she sought out her usual circle of friends and found them at a table, which, to both her resentment and in some way enjoyment, wasn?t more than a few feet away from the table Sam had chosen. She sat there, talking and laughing along with her little group of outsiders, Lily, Carmen and Harrison. Making a mental note to pretend as if the "commoners" were nowhere near her, Brooke joined Josh, Nicole, Mary Cherry and Sugar Daddy at their table.</p>
<p>"So, what?s the next lesson?" She asked, turning her head towards SD for the answer. He was the only one in the group who actually paid any attention to their schedule.</p>
<p>"Well, I have English." He answered. "But you, I believe, have an exiting Calculus class coming up." Brooke groaned at this reminder. The only thing she hated more than Calculus was the brunette, whose laughter could right now be heard all over the cafeteria.</p>
<p>"Aw, chin up Brookie." Mary Cherry patted her softly on the back. "It could have been far worse." Brooke looked at the southerner, failing to see what she meant.</p>
<p>"You could have gotten into Spam?s class." Nicole explained, eying said person in a most vicious manner as she spoke. "You?re lucky there were enough students for two separate classes."</p>
<p>"That?s right." Mary Cherry smiled. "Who knows which physical injuries you wouldn?t already have acquired if the two of you had been placed on the same team. I mean, with the lack of ongoing social acquaintances for the both of you in said class."</p>
<p>Brooke, for once, found herself both agreeing with and understanding the meaning of the slightly deranged southern girl?s point. Neither her own or Sam?s friends took Calculus, and the, mildly put, less than friendly feelings between the to vastly different girls could very easily lead to a full physical fight if they were forced to spend more than 10 minutes in the same room.</p>
<p>The blonde cheerleader turned her head to look at Sam. She was laughing at something Harrison had just said, unconsciously running the tip of her tongue along her white teeth as she did so. Brooke was fascinated by the way the brunette looked when she licked her teeth that way. It was actually kind of cute, almost attractive. She gaped inwardly as she realized what she was thinking, and quickly turned her head away.</p>
<p>"There she goes again!" Nicole said in a very offended tone.</p>
<p>"Who? What?" Brooke asked, pulling herself away from the thousands of voices and arguments churning in her head at the moment.</p>
<p>"Spam of course. Haven?t you been listening at all?"</p>
<p>"Sorry, I was just...thinking I guess." Brooke shrugged her shoulders, secretly hoping that none of them would ask exactly what, or worse yet, whom she had been thinking of. Nicole seemed to be satisfied though, and continued her speech about Sam?s utter horrendous way of acting.</p>
<p>"It?s almost as if she wants to show of that thing." Nicole?s voice sounded like she was about to throw up.</p>
<p>"Show off what?" Brooke said, not really paying any attention to her patronizing friend.</p>
<p>"Her tongue!"</p>
<p>"Oh." Brooke nodded in agreement as her eyes seemed to drift back to the gorgeous brunette all by themselves. Sam was now tapping the end of a pencil against her notebook. She stared intensely at the paper in front of her, which Brooke supposed was her Calculus homework for the day. Her tongue was once again at work in her cheek, where it usually was when Sam was really focusing on something. As Sam tugged a stray lock of brown hair behind her ear, the blonde noticed a slight frown on her face, indicating that the brunette was indeed very concentrated on whatever was written in her notebook. Brooke had to fight the urge to smile for a long time before winning. Sam just looked so innocent and endearing that she couldn?t help herself.</p>
<p>"...Don?t you think so Brookie?" Nicole said, once again interrupting the head-cheerleader?s thoughts.</p>
<p>"Sure." Brooke said absently, having no idea what her friend had been referring to. In an almost spiteful way, she denied her eyes the desire to wander back to Sam. Instead, she turned her head toward the window in front of her, studying the trees, the birds and all of the other things she normally wouldn?t waste two seconds on. Now however, things were different. She didn?t know how, and she wasn?t quite sure if she even wanted to know.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam felt someone staring at her and lifted her head to observe the other three people at her table. Obviously it couldn?t have been either of them, since they were all knee-deep into a conversation about which temperature measurement was better, Celsius or Fahrenheit? Finding her friends? choice of topic quite amusing, Sam smiled as she looked around the cafeteria, trying to find out who could have been looking at her. However, due to her somewhat delayed reaction, she saw no one with his or her eyes in her direction. Had she looked up just one second earlier, she would have seen Brooke McQueen turn her head away, her clear hazel orbs filled with confusion.</p>
