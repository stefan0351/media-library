<!-- How Did It Come to This? \ Part One -->

<p>Samantha McPherson?s head hurt for only God knows what time in yet another incredibly boring Geography lesson at Kennedy High. Something was upsetting her, that she was sure of. The only catch was that she had no idea what it was.</p>
<p>She pulled a face and rubbed two fingers against her temple while starring blankly at the textbook in front of her. Today?s text was about the weather. More specifically about how cold fronts and warm fronts were formed, something the aspiring journalist had absolutely no interest in whatsoever. She could hear their teacher droning on about something that, in some weird way she couldn?t quite figure out, apparently had something to do with this particular subject. She didn?t really pay any attention to it though, seeing as how the pounding headache continuously distracted her.</p>
<p>Sam sighed loudly, causing the girl next to her, Carmen Ferrera, to turn her head. An inquisitive look spread across the girl?s face as she looked at her friend. Sam merely opened her mouth and held two fingers in front of it, which resulted in a knowing grin from the dark-haired cheerleader. Sam grinned back, relieved that she had gotten Carmen out of asking what was wrong. She admitted to herself that she would love to talk about what really bothered her, but how could she do that when she didn?t even know what it was?</p>
<p>The brunette rested her head in her hands and starred at the passing clouds outside of the classroom window, once again slipping into her own little world. Maybe it had something to do with her relationship with Brooke McQueen, her blonde, cheerleading soon-to-be stepsister. Sam hated to admit it, but she had actually liked it for the few weeks she and Brooke had been able to be around each other without jumping headfirst into a bitchfight beyond compare. She smirked at the thought. "A bitchfight beyond compare." Yeah, that described it pretty well. What exactly had triggered the fight last week and returned their relationship to...She wasn?t sure if "normal" was the correct word to use in this connection. No, not normal. Her and Brooke?s relationship was definitely everything but normal. Bizarre then? Sam tasted the word, feeling it out in her mind. It seemed to fit the occasion quite nicely.</p>
<p>Their fight the previous Friday afternoon had most likely started out by them discussing some stupid little thing. A thing that must have been incredibly stupid and insignificant, since Sam couldn?t even remember what it had been. It could be the fact that Brooke kept forgetting to remove those annoying blonde hairs of hers from the drain whenever she had taken a shower. Or was it the way she paraded around the house, and school too for that matter, as if she was some stuck up little princess? No, those things couldn?t have anything to do with it. Sam was way too used to these particularly "charming" parts of Brooke?s personality to let them bother her anymore.</p>
<p>Sam shook her head lightly, letting out another small sigh. The fact was that she and Brooke both had an amazing talent to piss each other off. No matter what one of them did or said, the other always found it excruciatingly annoying. It had been that way since the day they first set eyes on each other, and it had only grown worse since they started living under the same roof. Sam had been ready to throw up when she had first found out that her widowed mother was in love with, and engaged to, Brooke?s divorced father. How anybody, especially her mom, could find a member of the McQueen family even remotely attractive she?d never understand.</p>
<p>Deciding to distract her thoughts from this saddening issue, Sam let her eyes wander across the other pupils in the classroom. Everyone seemed equally bored, probably sharing the brunette?s thoughts. This was definitely not the manner in which they wished to start an already painfully long Thursday. Geography, Calculus, English Literature and History. How the Board of Education managed to fill out an entire day with Sam?s most dreaded subjects was totally beyond her. Still, Sam noticed, there were three people in the room that didn?t seem to be too bored with this absolutely dull lecture, which they were all supposed to be listening to. Those three people just happened to be Nicole, Mary Cherry and Brooke. Looking at the small smirks on their faces, Sam guessed that they were, secretly of course, ogling a picture of some dreamboat of a male celebrity. Frankly, Sam didn?t even want to know which hunky stud portrayed himself is this month?s Cosmo or whatever it was the queen and crown princesses of Kennedy High were reading nowadays. The brunette had once, in a moment of temporary insanity, tried to keep up with Brooke?s reading habits. However, she had quickly dropped that idea as she realized that they changed more often than the blonde?s mood.</p>
<p>Sam jumped as the bell rang. Checking her watch in disbelief, she saw that it actually was recess already.</p>
<p>"Where were you? The Twilight Zone?" Carmen asked as they collected their books.</p>
<p>"Not exactly." Sam replied. "But somewhere similar though."</p>
<p>"You weren?t by any chance composing your new book?" Carmen said, a sly smile across her lips.</p>
<p>"What new book?" Sam asked, genuinely confused.</p>
<p>"Oh you know, the one called "A Gazillion Reasons for Disliking Brooke McQueen." Isn?t that what you named it?"</p>
<p>"Hmm." Sam pondered with a grin. "Switch the "a" with a "ten", and the "disliking" with a "loathing" and you might just have a decent title."</p>
<p>Someone bumped into Sam from behind. Whispering a soft "Sorry", the person quickly headed towards the exit of the room. The brunette was indeed surprised to realize that it was Brooke. This wasn?t the old Brooke McQueen she knew and hated with a good heart. This one was actually acting somewhat polite towards her? Sam caught a glance of Brooke?s face before the blonde walked out the door. Was that a glimpse of pain in those blue, terribly doe-like eyes of hers? For a brief moment Sam felt a slight sting of sympathy for the head-cheerleader, but quickly dismissed it again. Even if Brooke had heard her and Carmen talking, what could it possibly mean to her? They weren?t even friends for God?s sake. They were sworn enemies. Always had been, always would be. Sam frowned slightly, feeling more regret at this specific thought than she actually wanted to.</p>
