<!-- How Did It Come to This? \ Part Three -->

<p>Sam was standing by the fridge having a glass of cold milk when Brooke came home. The cheerleader had been to the Mall with Nicole and Mary Cherry for the past two hours, trying to forget all about the wave of emotions that had washed over her in the first recess that very day. It hadn?t been a complete success, but she was relieved to find that she felt nothing but the previous anger as she noticed Sam. Brooke watched her for a moment, unsure of whether she should simply walk away and leave things as they were or stay and yell at the brunette. She leaned very strongly towards the last idea as she realized that Sam was totally unaware of her presence.</p>
<p>"Well, if it isn?t little Miss Calcium herself." Brooke stated dryly. Sam slowly turned her eyes toward the sudden voice. It fact, her eyes were the only things moving on her. As the brunette finally removed the glass from her lips, she looked at Brooke with pure contempt.</p>
<p>"Hello Barbie." She responded in an equally dry tone. "Back from Malibu so soon?" Brooke glared at her, not that her doing that was anything new to the young brunette, especially not in a situation like this. There was just something in her stare this time. Something new. And that something made Sam feel very uncomfortable, for some reason she didn?t want to fight.</p>
<p>"I felt sorry for you. "Brooke said, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Seeing as how you have no social life." She quickly added, making sure that Sam took the reply as offensive.</p>
<p>Sam smirked, pretending to find Brooke?s words amusing. Mainly because she knew it would make the obnoxious blonde really pissed. Then maybe she?d leave well enough alone before the actual fight started.</p>
<p>"What are you grinning at?" Brooke continued, genuinely annoyed by Sam?s apparent amusement. "I wouldn?t find a total lack of social skills humorous if I was you."</p>
<p>"Well, you?re not me, now are you?" Sam said, still smiling as she placed her hands in the pockets of her jeans and leaned sideways against the kitchen counter.</p>
<p>"True." Brooke admitted. "And I thank God for that every single day of my life." Immediately after having said those words, the blonde wished that she could reach out and grab them before they reached Sam?s ears. The wish only grew stronger as she saw a deeply hurt expression quickly flash across Sam?s eyes.</p>
<p>"You know what?" Sam said spitefully as she tried to keep her voice from trembling. "As much as it pains me to say it, I sometimes wish that you in fact were me, if only for a day." She looked at Brooke, her eyes shining with unshed tears. "Then you would know what it?s like living with a bitch like you!" With that final statement, Sam stepped forwards, pushing the cheerleader aside rather brutally she then left the kitchen and headed for her room.</p>
<p>Brooke quickly regained her balance and ran after Sam. Reaching her she grabbed the brunette?s arm to stop her hasty retreat. "Sam, I..." Brooke paused, not knowing what to say. "I?m sorry." She said, almost whispering.</p>
<p>"So am I." Sam stated harshly. "Sorry that I ever met you!" She then freed her arm from Brooke?s grasp and proceeded towards the stairs. As Brooke once again tried to stop her, the brunette merely gave her another hard shove and ran the rest of the way to her room.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam locked the door behind her as soon as she set foot inside her own room. Thousands of thoughts were churning in her head. She needed to lie down. She needed to relax, to calm down, and to think. Staggering to her bed, she flopped down on it, burying her face in the softness of the pillow as treacherous tears continued to roll down her cheeks. Why was she so upset? Why did she even care what Brooke McQueen thought of her? She didn?t want to care, but the truth was that she did, she cared very much.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke nervously shifted her weight from one foot to the other as she remained standing by the bottom of the stairs. Should she go after Sam and try to apologize, or should she wait for her to calm down? Knowing Sam?s temperament after numerous fights, Brooke decided that the last idea would probably be the best one right now. She was aware that she had done something terrible, but she also believed that being hurled down the stairs by Sam would be somewhat of a rough punishment.</p>
<p>Sighing, Brooke returned to the kitchen. At least she could clean up for Sam. It wasn?t much of a penance considering the crime, but it was a start. After having poured out the remainder of Sam?s milk and putting the empty glass in the dishwasher, Brooke let her eyes glide across the room in search of anything else that needing cleaning up. As her eyes fell upon the kitchen table, she noticed a book lying on it. It had a black leather cover and a small piece of red silk ribbon sticking out of the end. Brooke leaned over it slightly, but found no title or any other clues to help her figure it out exactly what the book was about, so she opened it on the first page. What she saw there, were four words: "Diary of Samantha McPherson" The handwriting was soft and elegant with lots of cute little curves at the ends of the words.</p>
<p>Brooke was torn in two when she realized what the book was. This was Sam?s diary. Brooke didn?t even know that Sam had such a thing. She could feel her curious nature battling her strong sense of moral as she tried to figure out what she should do with the book. The honorable thing would clearly be to return without reading any further. But recently the blonde cheerleader had found herself increasingly intrigued by the mystery that was Sam McPherson. Reading her diary would most likely answer a great deal of her questions, if not all of them. Again, the small voice in the back of Brooke?s head spoke up after the latter statement. This time Brooke decided to listen.</p>
<p>Brooke closed the book again and picked it up. Turning around, she saw a note hanging on the refrigerator door. "Gone out for dinner. Don?t wait up. Mike and Jane." A big smile slowly spread across the teenager?s face. She had just gotten the perfect idea on how to make it up to Sam.</p>
