<!-- How Did It Come to This? \ Part Ten -->

<p>As Brooke reached the door to Sam?s bedroom, she placed a hand on the handle. Knowing fully well that this particular door tended to creek at the most inconvenient times, she slowly pushed it open and peeked inside. What she saw beyond that doorframe was the most erotic scene she had ever laid eyes on.</p>
<p>Sam lay on her bed, wearing only a pair of white satin boxers and a white bra. She had kicked her covers to the bottom of the bed, giving Brooke a full view of her shapely figure. A fine sheet of perspiration covered her skin and made her body glisten in the faint moonlight. Her hands were clamped around the headboard of her bed as she arched her body into the hands of an unseen and, as far as Brooke could tell, very skillful lover. The look on the brunette?s face was an intriguing mixture of desire, pleasure and raw need. Low growls filled with lust came from deep within Sam?s body, and Brooke listened, enraptured, as the brunette?s breath hitched in her throat time and again, indicating the steady climb towards her peak.</p>
<p>Swiftly forgetting her original reason for entering her housemate?s bedroom in the middle of the night, the blonde merely remained standing in the doorway. She was aware that she shouldn?t be watching this, but found herself unable to remove her gaze from the sensual display. Silently she made her way to Sam?s bed. Kneeling beside it she watched the brunette with awe written on her features. The guttural moans escaping Sam?s parted lips found Brooke secretly wishing that she too someday would be able to bring her beautiful housemate to such heights of ecstasy.</p>
<p>Deceptively strong fingers found their way to the center of her need and moved slowly within her. Soft lips wrapped themselves around her clit, and a raspy tongue flickered fast across the engorged pearl. The internal fire spread to her every limb, and Sam felt her body go rigid as the wave of the orgasm flooded her system.</p>
<p>"OhGodohGodohGodohGodohGod...BROOOKE!"</p>
<p>A pair of blonde eyebrows skyrocketed to the top of a very astounded forehead. Brooke stared dumbstruck at the panting figure on the bed in front of her. (<i>She?s dreaming of ME? But she?s straight! She should be dreaming of Heath Ledger or Joshua Jackson or Brian Krause, not me!</i>)</p>
<p>Brooke was pulled away from her matchmaking contemplations when Sam groaned and rolled over in the bed, facing the blonde. The brunette?s eyelids fluttered open for a second, long enough for her to notice a very familiar figure kneeling beside her bed.</p>
<p>Brooke was fully aware that she should probably be excusing herself right about now. She was supposed to get up, apologize for the intrusion and leave the room as fast as her shaking legs would allow her. She had the plan all worked out in her head, there was only one problem. She had absolutely no control over her body at this moment. All she could do was sit there, looking like a deer caught in the headlights.</p>
<p>"Brooke?" Sam asked groggily, struggling to focus on the blonde through a haze of sleep and arousal. "Why are you still here? The dream ended already." The brunette?s voice was hoarse from sleep, she was obviously not fully awake yet.</p>
<p>"You...You?re not..." Brooke took a deep breath and tried to calm her frizzled nerves. Unfortunately, finding out that your unrequited crush just might return your feelings is not exactly a calming situation.</p>
<p>"You?re not dreaming Sam." She exhaled, finding the carpeting extremely captivating.</p>
<p>Sam was suddenly wide awake and fully aware of her surroundings. She was in her bed and had just woken up from her, up until now, most erotic dream ever. This wouldn?t have been so bad, had the object of her desires not been sitting on the floor, mere inches away from her. Even worse, she was almost positive that she had called out this time. The fact that Brooke?s deep blush was visible in the pale moonlight confirmed her suspicion. She turned her back to the blonde and buried her face in the pillow.</p>
<p>"Mnet njout!"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I said..." Sam lifted her head and glared at the blonde. "Get. Out."</p>
<p>"Sam, I?m sorry...I didn?t mean to..." Brooke tried to apologize, but was interrupted by a very angry brunette.</p>
<p>"NOW!"</p>
<p>Brooke scrambled to her feet and fled the room. She felt terrible, but had no mind to be on the receiving end of Sam?s wrath, especially not now.</p>
<p>Seeing the bathroom door close again, Sam plopped back onto the pillows and hid her face in her hands. (<i>Great! Now what am I supposed to do?</i>)</p>
