<!-- First Sight \ null -->

<p>It was another beautiful morning in California. As was the custom
for Santa Monica, the sun shone brightly from a clear, cerulean sky,
and the air was filled with the twitter of small birds.</p>

<p>One male blackbird was sitting in the top of a well-grown oak,
sending out morning greetings to his neighbors. With chirps and
whistles, he reminded them that this was the last peaceful morning
they would have for some time to come, as today was the start of the
new year in the building below them. The one the humans had, for
unknown reasons, named "Kennedy High School".</p>

<p>Just as he was about to give that irritating sparrow who lived two
trees down a piece of his mind, the peace and quiet was disturbed by
the sound of cars pulling up to the school gates. Slightly miffed at
being interrupted in one of his better comebacks, he shot an
irritated glance at the many human young as they began filing out of
their parents' cars and towards the building. One student in
particular caught his attention, and he stared at her for a while,
trying to remember where he had seen the girl before.</p>

<p>It took him a while to remember, he was a birdbrain after all, but
he eventually caught on. He had seen her when he and his previous
mate had taken their own young out for a small trip before they left
the nest. They had rested in the garden of a house about a mile from
the school, not because he was tired, of course, but the young ones
still weren't too used to flying. At least that's what he told his
friends.</p>

<p>In the garden of that house, a small family of humans had been
sitting in the grass, apparently having lunch on the ground. He had
tried to wrap his mind around that one for some time, but trying to
figure out why they would expose themselves to the fatal claws of a
cat always gave him a headache. His mate had been much better than
him at that sort of thing anyway.</p>

<p>Ah, his mate. The color of the human girl's hair reminded him of
her. A deep, rich brown, so dark it was almost raven. She had been
the most beautiful thing he had seen since the last time he'd fallen
in love, about two days before he had met her. Unfortunately, she
had met her demise a short while ago. He had found two of her
feathers on the ground below their tree, and deduced that a cat had
gotten too close. </p>

<p>He knew that the mate of the strongest male in these trees looked
very much like her, but he decided that it couldn't possibly be her.
Which woman in her right mind would choose bragging muscle, good
looks and charisma over his keen intelligence? None, he assured
himself as he fluffed his feathers boisterously, keeping an eye on
the human girl.</p>

<p>He remembered that the older female human had called the
girl "Samantha", while the male one had used the names "Sam"
or "Sammy" to get the girl's attention. That had been another cause
for a headache on his part, but he eventually figured out that the
girl just had three names. Granted, the name "Samantha Sam Sammy"
was a strange one, but he thought it befitted the nature of humans
very well. They always had to be so complex. Why three names, when
one nickname was just as good?</p>

<p>He remembered the loving name his mate had given him. It still made
him smile to think about it, and he liked how his friends and
neighbors had picked it up in her remembrance. All he heard when he
went on his flights was "Hey, Idiot! What's up?", "Morning, Idiot."
Or "Watch out for that tree, you Idiot!" Oh yes, he smirked to
himself and fluffed his feathers some more; you know that you're
respected when your favorite nickname is used so frequently.</p>

<p>He threw one last look at the human girl. She was standing in the
middle of the courtyard, looking just a little lost. He didn't
really have time to worry about that though. His neighbor had just
left to find food, and maybe this time the female wouldn't peck him
on the head. He had long ago convinced himself that she was simply
playing hard to get, and decided that the more recent pecks had been
a lot gentler than the first ones. </p>

<p>Of course, none of that was true, but if there was one thing he
could do well, it was denial.</p>

<p align="center">*~*~*~*</p>

<p>Samantha McPherson shook her head as she walked across the
courtyard. A fond smile graced her full, ruby lips as she recalled
the numerous suggestions her mother, Jane, had made when she had
dropped her off a few minutes earlier. She had finally had to remind
the woman that she was 15, not four, and that this was High School,
not Kindergarten. </p>

<p>She briefly wondered if she would act the same way when it was time
for her to send her own children to school. With a smirk, she
concluded that she would probably act the exact same way, maybe even
worse. </p>

<p>Pulling away from her internal debate, Sam brought herself to a stop
and gazed speculatively at the building that loomed a little way
ahead of her. Kennedy High was one of the larger High Schools in the
Santa Monica area, and she was feeling a bit apprehensive about the
fact that there would be hardly any familiar faces to help her
through the first days here. Most of her friends from Victoria
Junior High lived several miles away from Kennedy, and had therefore
chosen to attend Santa Monica High, which was placed closer to the
centre of town. Kennedy High lay close to the edge of the brunette's
hometown, in a more sedate area than was offered by other High
Schools.</p>

<p>Sam shook her head and told herself to suck up her nervousness. At
least her childhood friend Harrison would be there, and if she got
her desired position as a writer for the school newspaper she would
meet some more people that way.</p>

<p>Fixing a confident smirk on her face, Sam pulled her head up high
and made her way through the throng of students as she headed for
her future.</p>

<p align="center">*~*~*~*</p>

<p>"Thanks for the lift, Daddy." Brooke McQueen leaned over and kissed
her father on the cheek</p>

<p>"Anytime, Honey." Mike replied, smiling as he watched his young
daughter get out of the car. "Have a nice day."</p>

<p>"You too, Daddy." Brooke smiled and waved at her father, peeking in
the open window after she closed the door. "See you later."</p>

<p>"Bye, Sweetie." Mike returned the wave as he pulled away from the
curb, leaving his 15-year old daughter standing on the sidewalk in
reflective silence.</p>

<p>A light breeze ruffled Brooke's long, blonde hair as she turned
around, clear hazel eyes gazing pensively at her new school. The
blonde hoped that she could continue cheerleading at Kennedy. She
knew that her experience as head-cheerleader at Kendall Junior High
would help her in the upcoming try-outs the next week, and adding to
that the fact that she, along with her best friend Nicole, had been
training through the whole summer, she figured they both stood a
good chance of making the team. Still, you never knew who came from
other schools or how good they were.</p>

<p>Brooke smiled and hoisted her book bag onto her shoulder, letting
her legs carry her towards her new domain.</p>

<p align="center">*~*~*~*</p>

<p>Having received her locker number and code for the year, Sam walked
down the halls in search of her locker. A smile came to her face as
she noticed a tall, gangly-looking boy standing by a locker very
close to her own.</p>

<p>"Hey, Harrison." She greeted her old friend, slightly surprised that
no response came.</p>

<p>Sam took a step closer to get a look at her friend's face, not an
easy task to accomplish since Harrison basically had his entire head
inside his locker. However, she soon spotted his beloved headphones.
If the thumping beat she could easily hear from a good 4 feet away
was any indication, Sam was hardly surprised that Harrison had not
heard her greeting. With that amount of sound keeping his ears
occupied, the boy wouldn't have noticed if a 747 landed right behind
him.</p>

<p>Feeling playful, the girl reached out and quick yanked the
headphones free of Harrison's head, grinning as the boy spun around
with a completely adorable dumbfounded expression on his face.</p>

<p>"Sammy!" Harrison exclaimed, his face splitting into a wide grin as
he hugged his best friend tightly. "Didn't see you there."</p>

<p>"Or hear me." Sam grinned and patted the walkman attached to the
side of his jeans. "Although I could probably hear that music as
well as you."</p>

<p>"Eyah." He admitted with an embarrassed grin. "You know I like to
play my favorites at full volume."</p>

<p>Sam shook her head and took a few steps to the right, opening her
locker and looking inside to make sure it was clean. Satisfied that
this year wouldn't be a replay of her first at Victoria where her
assigned locker had been filthy beyond any means she had thought
possible, she shut the locker once more and turned back to face her
friend.</p>

<p>"So, Mr. Music." She asked. "Got your schedule yet?"</p>

<p align="center">*~*~*~*</p>

<p>"Sure do." Nicole held up a sheet of white paper with her entire
school week neatly printed on it, along with a list of her teachers.</p>

<p>"Let me see, maybe we've got some classes together." Brooke reached
out and quickly snagged the paper from the shorter blonde, earning
herself a playful scowl in the process.</p>

<p>"I already checked for that, thank you." Nicole smirked, leaning
back against the wall as she watched her friend look over the
information displayed on the white sheet with absolute concentration.</p>

<p>"English and Bio Lab for this year." Brooke sighed and handed the
paper back to Nicole. "Well, that's not too bad. Maybe there'll be
more next year." </p>

<p>"Maybe." Nicole agreed. "I think we should focus more on the near
future instead of the distant one right now though. You know that
the try-outs are next Tuesday, right?"</p>

<p>"Sure." Brooke grinned. "I can't wait. I'm nervous as hell," she
laughed, "but I can't wait."</p>

<p>"Same here." Nicole gave her taller friend a wry smile. "Up for some
more training then?"</p>

<p>"Always." Brooke nodded as the two of them started down the
hall. "But I don't have any time today. How about we do it tomorrow
after school? We could probably use the field outside since none of
the sports have really started yet."</p>

<p>"Sounds good to me." Nicole shrugged. "Did you see the name of the
Bio teacher by the way?"</p>

<p>"Yeah." Brooke's brow furrowed slightly as she tried to
remember. "Roberta something-or-other, right?"</p>

<p>"Roberta Glass." Nicole shook her head. "Sounds like a rail-thin,
little old woman to me."</p>

<p>"I guess we'll find out bright and early tomorrow morning." Brooke
grinned and linked her arm with Nicole's as the two turned a corner
and disappeared from the sight of the crowd.</p>

<p align="center">*~*~*~*</p>

<p>"I can't believe they're having us start with Bio Lab tomorrow
morning!" Sam practically whined after looking at her schedule. "I
hate Bio!"</p>

<p>"Well." Harrison scratched his head, smirking slightly at the
display his friend gave. "Maybe you'll like it now. Who knows, this
Ms. Glass could be such a good teacher that you actually become
interested."</p>

<p>"Right." Sam scoffed. "Like that's ever going to happen."</p>

<p>"Hey, look on the bright side." Harrison smiled and threw one arm
casually over the girl's shoulders. "At least we'll get to sit
together."</p>

<p align="center">*~*~*~*</p>

<p>"See you in a week, Dad." Sam hugged her father tightly as she,
Harrison and Joe stood next to the car outside Kennedy High the
following morning. "And thanks for the ride."</p>

<p>"No problem, Sammy." Joe McPherson smiled and kissed his daughter on
the cheek before he got back inside the car. "Good luck with the
newspaper next week. You'll do great, Honey." He added, referring to
Sam's upcoming appraisal by the editor of Kennedy's newspaper. He'd
love to be able to be there himself, but his job demanded that he
take a trip to Washington and write an article about one of the new
bill proposals.</p>

<p>"Thanks." Sam smiled and bent down to kiss her father's cheek
through the open window. "Have a safe trip."</p>

<p>"Yeah, take care, Mr. McPherson." Harrison smiled and shook hands
with the man. "And thank you for giving me a lift today."</p>

<p>"Sure, Harrison." Joe smiled. "You two stay out of trouble now, you
hear?" He grinned broadly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." The two teenagers replied with matching grins, waving as
the car pulled away from the curb.</p>

<p>"Well." Sam sighed resignedly as the car disappeared from sight. "I
guess it's Bio time."</p>

<p align="center">*~*~*~*</p>

<p>Nicole wrinkled her nose in obvious distaste as she and Brooke
entered the classroom. Her main complaint was the color of the
walls, which could only be described as a very unattractive shade of
puke-green.</p>

<p>"Jeez." The shorter blonde mumbled as the two of them took their
seats at a free table. "It's not like we need any reminders of how
many pupils have probably barfed in this class."</p>

<p>"First of all; Eww!" Brooke groaned and held two fingers on front of
her mouth to show exactly how she felt about that particular
statement. "Second; Thank you so much for that lovely visual. Remind
me never to eat breakfast before Bio again."</p>

<p>Nicole grinned at her friend. "Sorry, Hon."</p>

<p>"'S alright." Brooke shrugged. "Still was pretty gross though, Nic."</p>

<p>"Bio IS gross, Brookie." Nicole smirked and shook her head at the
look on the taller blonde's face. "Might as well get used to it."</p>

<p>Brooke was about to form a reply when the door was opened and two
more pupils walked into the room. A tall boy had his arm slung
around the shoulder of a slightly shorter girl, and both were
laughing freely at what Brooke assumed to be a private joke.</p>

<p>Nicole quickly assessed the monetary background of the new arrivals.
Judging from the brands of clothes they were wearing, she was
convinced that neither the girl nor the boy came from any serious
money. They were obviously middle-class, thus making them unworthy
of her attention. Having reached her conclusion, she turned her
attention to the notebook lying open on the table in front of her,
making a few quick notes about some moves she thought she and Brooke
should work on at their little training session the same afternoon.</p>

<p>Brooke, in the meantime, was having a hard time keeping her eyes off
the girl. There was something in the way the brunette carried
herself that she just had to get a few more looks at. She walked
with the confident, poised gait of a model, but it was obvious to
the blonde that this was natural for the girl, rather than an
acquired skill.</p>

<p>"Good morning, my little half-wits." An obviously annoyed voice
suddenly boomed. Brooke tore her eyes away from the couple sitting
at the table next to her own, realizing that she had been so busy
studying the raven-haired girl that she hadn't even noticed the
remaining students file into the classroom, let alone their teacher
arriving. </p>

<p>And some teacher that was. The blonde felt her eyes saucer as the
large woman stood in front of the desk, her hands in her pockets and
a very bored look fixed on her face. </p>

<p>"Is that a he, she or an indefinable?" Nicole whispered. Brooke took
a closer look at the teacher, and decided that she really didn't
have a clue.</p>

<p>"You!" `It' snapped abruptly, glaring at Nicole. "Last name?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me?"</p>

<p>"Last name, you prissy little wannabe!" The creature roared. "Maybe
I should send you to the school nurse for a hearing aid?"</p>

<p>"Julian, sir." Nicole grumbled, stressing the `sir' to show her
dislike of being bullied.</p>

<p>"Better." The teacher responded, turning to Brooke and looking
pointedly at her.</p>

<p>"Er?McQueen, sir."</p>

<p>"And how about the two lovebirds over there?" Ms. Glass turned her
eyes upon the two dark-haired children who had entered earlier.</p>

<p>The girl looked highly amused at this reference as she mouthed the
word "Lovebirds?" to the boy.</p>

<p>"I asked you a question, young lady!" Glass boomed. "I strongly
recommend that you answer it!"</p>

<p>"McPherson." Came the reply in a velvety soft voice, accompanied by
a faint smirk and the slightest shake of the head as soon as the
teacher turned her eyes to the boy.</p>

<p>"J-John... sir." The boy stuttered, obviously more uncomfortable by
the intense look the teacher bestowed on him than the girl had been.</p>

<p>"Alright, ladies and gentlemen." Glass clapped her hands and looked
over the class with a taunting smile on her face. "As sorry as I am
to disturb your sorry little clique, and believe me when I say than
I'm not sorry at all..."</p>

<p>For some reason, none of the students had problem believing that
sentiment.</p>

<p>"From this day forward, seating arrangements are a fixed part of
this class. You will be sorted alphabetically by your last name.
John, McQueen, switch!"</p>

<p>Harrison and Brooke both jumped from their seats and quickly obeyed
the order. Neither of them wanted to be on this person's bad side.</p>

<p>"Hi." Brooke whispered as she slid into the empty seat next to the
brunette girl.</p>

<p>"Hi." The girl smiled at the blonde. "Think Glass got out on the
wrong side of the casket this morning?"</p>

<p>"Sounds like a likely prospect." Brooke returned the smile and
discreetly stuck out her hand. "I'm Brooke, by the way."</p>

<p>"I'm Sam." The brunette grasped the hand and shook it firmly, still
smiling.</p>

<p>"Introductions can be made later, ladies." Glass broke in. "That
what recess is for."</p>

<p>And thus, another year began at Kennedy High School.</p>
