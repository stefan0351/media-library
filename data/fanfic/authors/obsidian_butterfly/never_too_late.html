<!-- Never Too Late \ null -->

<p>Stars Hollow was not, perhaps, the most exciting town
in existence. In fact, boring wouldn't really be out
of place in describing it. Somewhat insulting to those
that lived there, perhaps, but applicable none the
less. It had its own charm, to be certain, but someone
more used to city life - and a fast-paced schedule -
would be very unlikely to feel it.</p>
<p>So, what was one Paris Geller doing there at seven in
the morning, ringing a certain doorbell?</p>
<p>Simple. Rory had asked her to be there. Granted, Yale
was still a month away (and the Gilmores *had* been
packing), but Rory wanted a second opinion as she over
everything again, and make sure she had everything she
needed *right now*. For her part, Paris had been ready
since before they'd graduated from Chilton (not that
this allowed her to slow down and relax - a waste of
time, as far as she was concerned). That was likely
why Rory had asked for her help. And it really just
took *sooooo much* convicing to get Paris to agree to
spend the whole day with her, after all.</p>
<p>Paris sighed as she waited for someone to answer the
door. Half a dozen times on the way over she'd almost
convinced herself that this would be a perfect time to
tell Rory how she felt. But no matter what line of
reasoning she used, she kept running into the same
stumbling block: she just couldn't do it. Even if she
set aside the fact that she had NO IDEA how Rory would
react to the idea, she just somehow *knew* that
nothing good would come of the admission. She never
got anything she really wanted, anything that would
make her *happy*. And Rory Gilmore could make her
happier than anything else on the planet. She'd long
ago resigned herself to a lifetime of lonliness.
Rory's friendship made it more tolerable, and Paris
wasn't about to do anything to jeoperdize that.</p>
<p>Her musings were cut short by the door to reveal a
smiling Lorelai Gilmore. Paris mustered up a small
smile in response. She was somewhat bemused by Rory's
mother, never entirely sure what to make of her. She
was funny, really nice, and smarter than a lot of
people gave her credit for. On the other hand, she was
also occasionally nonsensical, incredibly stubborn
(according to Rory), and she had - initially, at least
- seemed to dislike Paris considerably. Which, Paris
had been forced to admit, wasn't unjustified on
Lorelai's part, given how she'd been treating the
woman's daughter. But Lorelai seemed to have warmed up
to her, and Paris kind of enjoyed knowing that at
least *someone's* mother gave a damn about her. "Good
morning."</p>
<p>"Morning, Paris," she said, bustling the girl inside
and shutting the door behind her, then steering her
towards the kitchen. "You're right on time - well,
actually a little early, but close enough. I was just
getting ready to head out for the day, so you two'll
be on your own for lunch. Rory has my cell number, if
you need to get hold of me for any reason." She barely
paused for breath as she sat a slightly confused Paris
down at the table, then got herself a cup of coffee.
The fact that she was almost certainly going to be
heading to Luke's before she headed to the Dragonfly -
Paris didn't know just how much work it took to get an
inn fixed up, but it certainly seemed to be keeping
Lorelai busy - didn't seem to occur to her. No, Paris
thought with a mental smirk, she doesn't have a
problem... "Rory's just getting out of the shower
right now-" Paris missed the next part of what Lorelai
was saying as she tried desperately to steer her mind
away from the image of a wet, naked Rory. She could
feel her face growing warm. She tuned back in as
Lorelai was saying, "-eed anything else, you can
always check with Luke." She paused, then asked,
"Paris? Are you okay? You look a bit flushed."</p>
<p>"W-what? Oh, no, I'm fine." Before the other woman
could press her any further, she countered with,
"Luke, he's the guy that runs that diner, right? I
remember him. I also seem to remember Rory telling me
that you usually go there in the morning for coffee."
She directed a look at Lorelai's mug.</p>
<p>"That's him, all right. And yeah, I usually do stop
there, but I don't have time this morning, sadly. You
*must* try his coffee some time."</p>
<p>Paris smirked. "Well, if I *must*..."</p>
<p>"Oh, you must," Lorelai said with a mock-serious
expression. "It's one of the town's laws now, you
know. Just got passed last week."</p>
<p>A snicker. "I wouldn't be at all surprised."</p>
<p>For a moment, there was a peaceful silence. Which was
broken by a contemplative, "I'm glad you and my
daughter are getting along better these days."</p>
<p>Paris blinked. "Ummm... thanks. So am I." Where was
the elder Gilmore going with this?</p>
<p>As it turned out, she was doing what she usually did -
cutting through to the heart of the matter. "So? When
are you going to tell her?"</p>
<p>"Tell her what?" No, she couldn't mean...</p>
<p>"When are you going to tell Rory how you feel?"</p>
<p>Oh, damn, she *did* mean that. "I don't... I don't
know what you mean," Paris said, not meeting the
woman's gaze. Maybe if she wished really hard, the
subject would be dropped? Yeah, right.</p>
<p>"Who do you think you're kidding? Why don't you just
kiss her and tell her you love her? Get it over with?"</p>
<p>For a moment, Paris was too astonished to do more than
gape openly. Eventually, she managed to ask, "Wha...?
How did you...?"</p>
<p>For the first time in a while, Lorelai seemed to be
perfectly serious. "I long ago learned what the signs
of hidden crushes are. I also know my daughter, and
you should tell her. Believe me, she's not about to
laugh at you, or whatever it is that you think that's
stopping you."</p>
<p>"... and would she love me?" Paris whispered.</p>
<p>Lorelai shot her a sympathetic look. "I don't know. I
can't answer that question for you. Only she can. I
*can* tell you this, however: I've never seen her talk
about someone, worry about their opinion, or try to
impress them as much as she does with you. And while
she's never said anything about being attracted to
other girls... Well, I've seen her checking you out, a
couple times."</p>
<p>For some reason, Paris suddenly had trouble breathing.
"You... have?" she choked out. How had *she* missed
that?</p>
<p>Lorelai grinned. "Yeah, I have. And as weird as my
baby girl liking another girl may be to me, I'll get
over it, and it's obvious she likes you. So ask her
out, already."</p>
<p>"Wait a minute. Why are you pushing me so hard on
this, if you find it so 'weird'?"</p>
<p>A sigh. "Because I can tell that you'd do anything to
make Rory happy, and that's all I want."</p>
<p>"I would- I mean, I will, but I can't just-"</p>
<p>"Oh, what do you want, an open declaration of love
before you make *any* kind of move?" she asked,
getting exhasperated.</p>
<p>Paris frowned in thought, then suddenly grinned
herself as she thought about something Rory had
mentioned on more than one occasion. If it didn't at
least make Lorelai stop talking about this, it might
at least make the potential humiliation worth it.
"Okay, tell you what: I'll make a deal with you."</p>
<p>Lorelai raised an eyebrow. "Oh?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. If I tell Rory how I feel, then *you* have to
ask Luke out on a date. And make sure he *knows* that
it's a date. And that you're interested."</p>
<p>For the first time in all the time Paris had known
her, she was treated to the sight of Lorelai Gilmore
shocked speechless. "Ex- excuse me?"</p>
<p>"Please. You think Rory hasn't told me about how close
you two are? And if there's anyone who knows what
someone who doesn't want to admit their feelings looks
like, it's me."</p>
<p>"Just because we're close-"</p>
<p>"Why do you think that, when you went to go tell him
you were engaged to Mr. Medina, something like half
the town showed up to watch? Yeah, Rory told me about
that. Evidently, you two are the only ones who haven't
noticed." A smirk. "So, do we have a deal?" She held
out her hand.</p>
<p>Lorelai stared at it for a long moment, likely trying
to figure out whether or not Paris was right. Finally,
she took it.</p>
<p>"Deal."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>It wasn't until sometime after noon that the girls
managed to slow down enough to call for some takeout
Chinese. "I thought you said you'd gotten some packing
done before this," Paris said archly as she lifted a
forkful of Lo Mein to her mouth.</p>
<p>"We did!" Rory knew she sounded a bit defensive, but
couldn't help it. "But you've obviously never tried
packing for something with my mother. She would have
had me taking three times as much stuff as I'd need."</p>
<p>"And to think, we haven't even tackled your books
yet."</p>
<p>Rory sighed. "How am I supposed to pick which ones I
don't want to bring? I need them all."</p>
<p>"You don't *need* them, Gilmore. They're books. You
*like* them. And you *are* going to be coming back
every weekend, aren't you? Just exchange some every
now and then."</p>
<p>"I guess that's true," Rory said, brightening. Paris
felt a warm glow at having caused that lovely smile to
appear. "Thanks."</p>
<p>"Not a problem."</p>
<p>They finished their meal in relative quiet, save for a
little pre-Yale conjecturing. Rory thought that Paris
seemed more nervous about it than she did, but
attributed it to the other girl's - was anxiety too
strong a word? - about new experiences. She *hated* it
when anything threw off her Plan, as Rory knew all too
well. She had occasionally been *sooooo* tempted to
provide one that would totally throw Paris
off-balance, but had decided that doing so would be
rather mean, all things considered. So she'd just
resisted the impulses, burying them deep enough so
that they wouldn't cause any damage.</p>
<p>Eventually, the two of them moved upstairs to Rory's
bedroom to look through her books. After about an hour
of that, Paris flopped down on one of the few spots
that wasn't covered in novels: the bed. "Jeez,
Gilmore. I knew you liked to read, but..."</p>
<p>Rory, smiling sheepishly, sat down near her. "I know,
I know. But you see the problem, right?"</p>
<p>"The fact that a good number of these could be used as
deadly weapons?"</p>
<p>"Well, I once read that Neil Gaiman's definition of
true art was the ability to stun a burgler with it,"
Rory replied with a grin. "But you know full well
that's not what I meant."</p>
<p>Paris grinned back at her, wishing that the moment
could just go on forever. "Yeah, yeah. You couldn't
fit this many books in a dorm room even if you had it
all to yourself, rather than just half of it."</p>
<p>Rory nodded, sobering slightly. "I know. That's gonna
be weird. I've never shared a room with anyone for
that long."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm sure you'll be a good roommate to whoever
you'll end up with. I certainly enjoyed rooming with
you that summer in Washington."</p>
<p>"Thanks, but you're kind of biased. Besides, I already
knew you ahead of time. This is different."</p>
<p>Biased? Did she mean...? But no, it wasn't the time to
get into *that* just yet. "Maybe, but you make friends
with people faster than anyone I've ever seen."</p>
<p>"Oh?" Rory asked, her voice taking on a teasing
quality. "And just who are you comparing me to? Louise
and Madeline? I do believe that I'm insulted by that.
And don't forget, I had to room with you, too. Not the
easiest of tasks."</p>
<p>Paris smirked at her and edged closer. "Are you saying
I'm not a good roommate?"</p>
<p>"No, not at all. You're a great one... if you want
someone who never talks to you."</p>
<p>"Oh, now I'm hard to get along with, am I?"</p>
<p>"I don't think I should answer that question. It might
incriminate me."</p>
<p>"I think I might *tickle* you if you keep this up."</p>
<p>A corner of Rory's mouth started edging up. "You
wouldn't dare."</p>
<p>A low chuckle. "Oh, Gilmore, you should know better by
now than to challenge me like that..."</p>
<p>Rory blinked. "Now, Paris, let's-" Whatever else she
was about to say was cut off as Paris practically
tackled her and proceeded to carry out her threat. In
short order she found that Rory was deathly ticklish
just under her ribs.</p>
<p>The few books that had been on the bed were quickly
knocked off by Rory as she thrashed around helplessly,
laughing hysterically. Dammit, how had Paris found her
worst spot that fast? In a desperate attempt to stop
her, Rory wrapped her arms around Paris and pulling
her close enough that her hands were pinned tightly
under her body. As she regained her breath, she looked
into Paris's eyes triumphently, their faces now about
an inch apart.</p>
<p>It wasn't until Paris inhaled sharply and stiffened
that Rory realized how big a mistake she'd just made.
She knew the girl had a crush on her, so what did she
do? She pulled her into a hug so tight it was
practically a lovers' embrace. Stupid, stupid, stupid!
Meanwhile, lurking in the back of her mind somewhere,
unnoticed, was the observation that she was focusing
so much on her self-recrimination so that she wouldn't
notice the way her body was reacting to Paris's
proxemity.</p>
<p>For her part, Paris was being overwhelmed by sensory
input, and the temptation to cross that last inch of
space between her lips and Rory's was almost more than
she could bear. "Rory..." She began in a choked-up
voice, "I-I..." It finally sunk in that Rory was
breathing as rapidly as she was. "A-are you...?" Rory
finally let her go, and after just a few moments
longer than necessary she edged away. For a long time
they just sat there, each trying to get their thoughts
together. Finally, Paris managed to say, "I think...
we need... to talk."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I guess we do."</p>
<p>After another minute of silence, it became clear to
Paris that she was going to have to speak first.
"Well, I guess it's rather obvious by now that I like
you." She paused to clear her throat and continued,
"I'm not very good at... well, I don't have a lot of
experience with... talking about how I feel, you know?
But I l... I lo... Dammit! Rory, I-I..."</p>
<p>Rory moved closer, taking Paris' hand in her own and
rubbing it gently. "It's okay, Paris. You don't have
to say it. I think I know how you feel."</p>
<p>"But if I don't say it now...! Wait, you knew?"</p>
<p>"I suspected, anyway." Anticipating Paris's next
question, she said, "Ever since that time in
Washington when I heard you, erm, talking about me in
your sleep..."</p>
<p>"...oh." Paris could tell she was blushing again, so
she began studying the bedspread. "You never said
anything about it."</p>
<p>"I didn't want to embarrass you." Rory dropped Paris's
hand and took hold of her chin, raising it until she
was looking into her eyes. "Look, I'm not going to
pretend I know what to do in this situation, but I do
know that... I trust you. Now, what do you want to
tell me?"</p>
<p>Paris took a deep breath. This was it; she'd never get
a better chance than this. "I've been trying to tell
you... that I love you." And screwing up every last
bit of courage that she had, she crossed the remaining
distance and kissed Rory.</p>
<p>It felt as if fireworks were going off in the back of
her mind. She'd dreamed of this moment so many times
that she almost couldn't believe it was actually
happening. Never, in all the times that she'd pictured
kissing Rory had she imagined how soft the other
girl's lips would be, how perfectly the two of them
would fit together.</p>
<p>Rory, on the other hand, nearly passed out. Paris was
kissing her. Ever since she'd first gotten the idea
that Paris liked her, she had, almost despite herself,
tried to imagine what kissing her might be like. In
fact, her imagination had occasionally run away with
her, leaving her blushing furiously, especially if her
mother happened to wander across her before she could
calm down.</p>
<p>But she'd never imagined that it could feel this good.</p>
<p>She moved her hand up a little to carress Paris's
cheek, only peripherally noting Paris mirroring her
action. The rest of the world had quickly faded away
for the both of them.</p>
<p>When asked later, neither one would ever really be
able to say just how long they had sat like that
before they'd broken apart, looking at each other.
"I'm... not sure what to say," Rory admitted.</p>
<p>"I don't want you to say anything," Paris replied.
"I'm not Dean. I'm not going to freak out if you don't
instantly say you love me. I can wait as long as you
need."</p>
<p>Rory gave her a relieved smile. "I'm glad to hear
that, because I'm not sure how I feel yet. I mean, I
do like you, obviously, but I don't know if I'm ready
for that kind of commitment yet. I mean, I just got
out... well, I'm not sure *what* to call it, but
between Jess and Dean... I'm a bit emotionally worn
out, you know?"</p>
<p>"I suspected. But that's okay. We *do* have to figure
out how we're going to make this work, especially with
Yale coming up, but we have time."</p>
<p>"Yeah, we do." Rory suddenly grinned mischieviously.
"But I do know what I want to do next."</p>
<p>Suspecting where this was going, Paris felt her own
lips pulling up into a smile. "Oh?"</p>
<p>"Yep. I want to kiss you again."</p>
<p>"No one's stopping you."</p>
<p>A chuckle. "Glad to hear it."</p>
<p>After that, there weren't any more words.</p>
