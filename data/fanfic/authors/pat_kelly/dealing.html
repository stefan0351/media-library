<!-- Dealing \ Story -->

<p>Buffy trudged down the stairs, her legs feeling like logs. Why did this have to happen?
Were the cosmic forces testing them?  She was sick and tired, literally, of all the crap.
Faith didn't deserve to have a nervous breakdown. They were stuck now, with problems she
had no clue how to deal with. Besides coping with what they did, there was the police. And
sooner or later, they'd find out his name.</p>

<p>She walked into the living room and Cordelia and Willow rose from the couch.</p>

<p>"She's finally asleep." The slayer said wearily</p>

<p>"I've never seen her like that." Willow said. "And uh...you don't look much better."</p>

<p>Her emotions were so screwy, that she started to giggle uncontrollably. They were quiet
until she ran out of laughter.</p>

<p>"You've got something on your hand." Cordelia noticed.</p>

<p>Buffy looked at her hand. The man's blood had dried on it. Her skin started to itch. It
increased, she tried scratching, but then it just felt dirty. She ran into the kitchen,
turned on the faucet, and stuck her hands underneath the stream of water. She grabbed the
bar of soap and started scrubbing. Harder and harder. Faster and faster. She watched the
blood mix in with the water and swirl down the drain.</p>

<p>There was no trace of red anywhere on her hands anymore, but it still wasn't enough. She
kept scrubbing. She may not have done it, but she was an accomplice.
She had touched him, had watched him take his last breath. Both her hands started to
shake, and she kept scrubbing.</p>

<p>Willow and Cordelia were standing at her sides. The redhead reached under the water, and
pulled her friend's hands out.</p>

<p>"Buffy, look."</p>

<p>Her skin was irritated. She had scrubbed some of it right off. She couldn't be strong any
longer. It took energy she had run out of. Willow touched her hands, and that’s when she
let it all out. Her legs gave out, and they both went to catch her, and eased her to
floor. She sobbed, and then quickly covered her mouth so she wouldn't wake Faith up.</p>

<p>"Talk to us." The hacker said softly. "Please."</p>

<p>"Yeah. We can help."</p>

<p>"I don't know." Buffy choked with a shuddering breath. "I don't know how you can."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Willow sat on the porch seat outside Buffy's house, with Giles. She called him, and asked
him to come over. She didn't know what else to do. Once she heard the whole story, she
knew he was the only one Buffy would let her tell. The blonde slayer was inside, having
fallen asleep on the couch, after much coaxing. They had to do something, and neither
slayer was in any condition to do anything.</p>

<p>"Giles...they're both...it's horrible."</p>

<p>"I can imagine." The older man said. "You've been a good friend, Willow. Sleep is the best
thing for them at the moment. They could have, for lack of a better term, 'burnt out'."</p>

<p>"What do we do?"</p>

<p>"There is procedure in situations like this, but I doubt it would help either of them.
Most importantly, they need all the support they can get."</p>

<p>"They will."</p>

<p>"I know." He smiled. "The best I can think to do right now, is wait until morning to make
any decisions. We've all had a long night."</p>

<p>"What if the cops...?"</p>

<p>"It'll be fine, I promise you. Why don't you let me drive you and Cordelia home?"</p>

<p>"But...we can't leave them alone."</p>

<p>"I'll stay." Angel said, stepping out of the shadows.</p>

<p>Giles stood, as Willow went inside to get Cordelia. He looked at the vampire sadly.</p>

<p>"I never expected them to have to deal with this. It's not like it hasn't happened before,
but you never think it'll happen to your slayers." He sighed. "What am I saying? I don't
work for the Council any longer."</p>

<p>"It'll be difficult. Especially because of their age. I know about remorse and guilt when
it comes to killing. I'm almost two-hundred and fifty years old, and it's still there."</p>

<p>"The psychological damage they could suffer could be irreparable "</p>

<p>"If they weren't as close as are, I'd say it could be a harder road, and they might have
trouble walking the line, but they'll survive it. Cope. It'll still be hard, but they've
got each other, and a group of friends willing to be there for them."</p>

<p>"So what's your advice?"</p>

<p>"Keep their environment as positive as you can. They'll need it. And be ready for the
police."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Faith awoke at around four-thirty in the morning, sweating, and screaming Buffy's name.
She had come out of a nightmare where she was forced to watch herself murder that man over
and over again. Except, when she dropped the stake in the dream, it never hit the ground.
It turned, the sharp end pointing in Buffy's direction, and then it killed her. And Faith
couldn't stop it.</p>

<p>She looked around for her girlfriend, not able to find her. Angel was the one who was at
her side. Her eyes were frightened, tear-stained, and confused.</p>

<p>"Angel? Where is she?"</p>

<p>"She's fine. She fell asleep downstairs, and they didn't want to move her."</p>

<p>Buffy ran in the bedroom.</p>

<p>"I'm here." She said soothingly, getting on the bed. They embraced. "And we're both
alive."</p>

<p>"How'd you know I was -?"</p>

<p>"I was dreaming that...you got staked, then I heard you scream. It woke me. I figured you
were dreaming...well, you know."</p>

<p>Faith sighed in relief. "I didn't mean to..." She looked at the vampire. "I didn't mean
to, Angel. I swear."</p>

<p>"Nobody thinks you did. Either of you." He assured her. "Why don't you try to go back to
sleep? I'll leave."</p>

<p>"I can't. It hurts."</p>

<p>"I don't want to either." Buffy said. "Sleep is bad."</p>

<p>"I'll make tea then." Angel said, going out the door.</p>

<p>"You know what?" The blonde said once he was gone. "I don't like tea. Add to that the fact
that Angel's downstairs making it...scary."</p>

<p>That got them laughing softly.</p>

<p>"We should probably drink it though. To be polite." Faith said.</p>

<p>"Okay. But you're drinking it first."</p>

<p>"Deal." The brunette swung her legs over the side of bed. "I hit rock bottom last night,
didn't I? I think I'm still there. Everyone saw..."</p>

<p>"No one thinks any less of you. I did the same thing. At least I think I did. It's all a
blur."</p>

<p>"I...I need a shower." Faith stood up, and then turned around. "In this together?"</p>

<p>"Whatever happens. The gang's behind us too." The younger slayer didn't move, so Buffy got
up, walked to her, and gave her a small kiss, meant to comfort. "K?"</p>

<p>Faith nodded, the beginnings of a smile appearing, but when she realized it, she wouldn't
let herself. She headed to the bathroom.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Faith, are you okay in there?" Buffy asked, knocking, after the girl had been in the
bathroom for forty-five minutes.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes before, Buffy had heard the water turn off, so she wasn't showering
anymore. The tea had long since gotten cold. She remembered then, that it was a school
day. Going to school would be too normal, and she couldn't handle that just yet. Plus, if
someone even looked at her, she would think they knew. Paranoia was also something she
wanted to avoid.</p>

<p>There were those people who would say that locking yourself in a house, where the thoughts
would fester, wouldn't help jumpstart the healing process. That getting back into the
daily routine as quickly as possible, and dealing with the event in small doses, was the
best thing to do.</p>

<p>She had thought about that, and then she knew Faith would be here. She could come with
her, but eventually, she'd be questioned. They'd find out she wasn't a student and Snyder
would kick her out. For good. Well, Buffy wasn't going to leave her, not for a second. And
the truth of it was, she didn't want to be separated from her.</p>

<p>In a couple hours, she'd call Giles, and tell him she wasn't coming in today. No, she'd
have Angel call.</p>

<p>"You can come in." Faith called from the other side of the door.</p>

<p>Buffy walked in to see her, in a bathrobe, standing in front of the sink and looking into
the mirror on the wall.</p>

<p>"I don't feel clean. I tried, but I don't."</p>

<p>Buffy remembered what she done to her hands. "You didn't hurt yourself, did you?"
Faith shook her head. "Whatcha doin'?" She asked next, as gently as she could.</p>

<p>"Tryin' to figure out if I look any different. I can't tell."</p>

<p>"You look the same to me."</p>

<p>She joined Faith, standing beside her. Looking at herself in the mirror, she knew what the
other slayer meant. She could see herself, but she couldn't. Her face appeared distorted.
The only thing she could really make out was her eyes. But they weren't hers. They were
his. Staring back at her, dead, lifeless...</p>

<p>Faith grabbed her hand as she looked away.</p>

<p>"And thinkin'."</p>

<p>"About?"</p>

<p>"School. If I...if we get busted, that's not in the cards anymore."</p>

<p>"But how would they...?"</p>

<p>"Witnesses? Anything we touched has our prints..."</p>

<p>"I touched his shirt..."</p>

<p>"You said the men in blue weren't too bright here, right? Maybe they'll just stick it in
the 'unsolved' category. But then, we...I don't pay."</p>

<p>"You're not one of those...people. The sick, demented...it was a mistake. That *we* made
and shouldn't have to go to jail for."</p>

<p>"There's no such thing as 'accidental murder', B. We can't just tell them, 'We're vampire
slayers and we thought he was one of 'em. Oops. Sorry.' And you can't tell me you don't
think you need to be punished."</p>

<p>Buffy couldn't argue.</p>

<p>"Who was he?"</p>

<p>It had just occurred to her that they hadn't asked that question yet. Faith raised her
eyebrows. That *was* a good question. But did she want the answer? Wouldn't it help if he
remained a nobody? Without a life and a history?  But maybe it would help if she could put
a name to the face. It would be harder for her to forget then.  It wouldn't make it easier
to move on. She wanted that. To torture herself.</p>

<p>"Giles is here." Angel said, standing in the doorway. They both turned their heads
sharply, hating his stealth prowess just then. "He's got news."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"I know it's early." Giles said as they sat down on the sofa.</p>

<p>"We were up." Buffy answered as she and Faith snuggled together.</p>

<p>"How are you feeling?"</p>

<p>"Been better." Faith said quietly. "What's...?" She didn't even feel like finishing the
question.</p>

<p>"I had trouble sleeping myself, and so I turned on my television..."</p>

<p>"You have a TV?" A shocked Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Um...yes."</p>

<p>"As if my world wasn't messed up enough." She made a 'go on' gesture.</p>

<p>"I was watching one of those less than stellar psychic infomercials...well, it was
pre-empted, and it cut to a reporter outside of City Hall. They found a body propped up in
an alleyway."</p>

<p>That got Faith's attention. She sat straight up.</p>

<p>"Who was he?" The brunette asked. Giles hesitated. "You came here to tell us. So tell."</p>

<p>"The Deputy Mayor. Allan Finch."</p>

<p>"Allan Finch..." She kept saying the name over and over in her mind. Not only did she kill
someone; he was high profile too. She got up and started to pace. "That's great.
Just...wonderful."</p>

<p>"Faith, Buffy, you need to understand something.  It's not the first time like something
like this has happened."</p>

<p>Faith halted her pacing. "What?</p>

<p>"Slayers are on the front lines of a nightly war. Now, it's, it's tragic, but accidents
have happened."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me I can balance it out, Giles. Okay? It doesn't matter if we've saved a
million people by doing this. I'm not just gonna say that the good outweighs the bad and
forget the guy who got in the way one time."</p>

<p>"I'm not asking you to forget. Not at all. But you do save lives, have saved them
countless times. There are risks that come with any job. Only slaying's risks are
somewhat...higher."</p>

<p>"I took somebody's life, Giles."</p>

<p>"Faith..." Buffy tried to interject.</p>

<p>"Do you know how that feels?"</p>

<p>"Yes." He said flatly. "And it eats away at you, I know. Believe me."</p>

<p>"I know too." Angel added. "Remember what you said to me? I could say the same to you
now."</p>

<p>"I didn't know how much it hurt then." Faith said.</p>

<p>"We all have a purpose. Yours has been laid out for you. And you're good at it."</p>

<p>"Until I screw up again."</p>

<p>"If you think you will, then you will."</p>

<p>"You won't. We won't." Buffy insisted.</p>

<p>"You don't know that." The brunette countered.</p>

<p>"No, I don't. But I believe it."</p>

<p>Faith sighed. "What about him?"</p>

<p>"Mourn, grieve, pray...whatever it is you feel you need to do. But he is gone, and there's
nothing more we can do." Giles advised.</p>

<p>"There should be."</p>

<p>"Let me make this clear. I hold no malice toward you or Buffy, and neither does anyone
else. You're only human, even with your higher station in life. It's a heavy burden to
carry the survival of the world on your shoulders, and sadly, innocents may get caught in
the fight. However, people still count on you, whether they know it or not, and they need
you."</p>

<p>The slayers digested that, being quiet.</p>

<p>"You said...it's happened before. What does the Council do?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Well, the Council investigates, um, metes out punishment if punishment is due. But I...I
have no plans to involve them. They are cut off from everything, and could only hinder -"</p>

<p>"Gettin' away with murder. That's what we're doing." Faith still couldn't get off it. It
seemed so wrong. "I just -"</p>

<p>"Hold up a sec." Buffy said, getting a thought. "What's a question we're not asking?"
They all waited. "What was the Deputy Mayor of Sunnydale, doing in a dark alley, late at
night? Why was he out there?"</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Angel left just before sun-up, and most of the slayers' day was spent sitting up against
the couch together in complete silence. Occasionally, Giles did call to check up on them,
and they took turns going to answer the phone. They just kept replaying the event over and
over, trying to come to terms with it, but to no avail. They accepted the fact that they
had to move forward, but that didn't work too well considering they had nothing else to
think about. Or do. Buffy thought maybe she *should* have gone to school. Or somewhere
they could both go, where they could be together at all times, anyway.</p>

<p>They never felt like getting up, though.</p>

<p>At around the time school let out hours later, the gang came over, and Willow wouldn't
stop giving Faith hugs. They watched TV, movies, played board games...anything to try and
get the slayers cheery. Xander had even brought Faith fast food, which she ate quickly.
She didn't know whether it was because she was hungry (she hadn't eaten in two days), or
if it was just a distraction. They didn't talk about what had happened, because that was
the last thing their two friends needed to hear about.</p>

<p>Buffy and Faith had decided to check out City Hall after dark. Once Buffy had brought up
that question, Faith, Giles and Angel got suspicious. The likelihood that something was
going on with the town's government was pretty good; once they had all started thinking
about it. Maybe by going there, it would help them, Faith especially, heal.</p>

<p>At least they would be doing something...in his memory.</p>

<p>"Six! I got a six, I go first." Xander said happily.</p>

<p>"No, I go first." Cordelia said.</p>

<p>"Cordy, I know how Trouble works. The rules say that the first person to get a six, goes
first."</p>

<p>"Did I say I cared about the rules? I go first, Xander." She told him forcefully.</p>

<p>"Right. Please go first. I want you to."</p>

<p>"You are totally whipped." Faith commented.</p>

<p>"Is that something I should be ashamed of?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I don't know why guys feel like submission is such a bad thing. It may be a tad demeaning
-"</p>

<p>"Go. It's your turn." Cordelia instructed.</p>

<p>He hit the dice bubble quickly. "Popping, see? Moving piece now."</p>

<p>Buffy walked back to the kitchen after silently watching the exchange in the living room.
Willow and Oz were standing over the counter, making more sandwiches.</p>

<p>"She was semi-sarcastic." The blonde smiled.</p>

<p>"I knew we could help." Willow said.</p>

<p>"You are. Really. Thanks."</p>

<p>"How you holding up?" Oz asked.</p>

<p>"I'll..." The doorbell rang. "Get the door."</p>

<p>She walked back into the living room, and going to the door, her and Faith's eyes met.
Standing outside, was a man in a suit. Who flashed a badge.</p>

<p>"Buffy Summers?" She nodded. "I'm Detective Stein. I'd like to ask you a few questions."</p>

<p>"Sure." He came in and shut the door behind him. He looked around. Xander and
Cordelia got off the floor, and Faith got off the sofa and sat on the steps.
"Have...have a seat."</p>

<p>Stein focused on Faith, as he sat on the couch. "And your name?"</p>

<p>"Faith."</p>

<p>"I'll get right to the point. I got a couple of witnesses who put girls matching your
descriptions, near the alley where the Deputy Mayor was found murdered last night. You
hear about that?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. Really sad." Buffy said genuinely. "We were here watching movies with our friends."</p>

<p>"They were, officer." Cordelia chipped in.</p>

<p>"You two," He pointed to the brunette, "live here together?"</p>

<p>"Uh huh." Faith answered.</p>

<p>"And you didn't leave the house at all?"</p>

<p>"We were at the Bronze for a little." Buffy said.</p>

<p>"I see." He cleared his throat. "Somebody stabbed this guy through the heart. Strange
thing is, the weapon, it was made out of wood. Any of this mean anything to you?"</p>

<p>"Nope." She answered. "Sorry."</p>

<p>Faith shook her head.</p>

<p>"I have enough for now." He got up.</p>

<p>"Do they have any idea why he might have been killed?" Faith asked.</p>

<p>"It's still an ongoing investigation, and I can't really comment. But these days, it seems
like murderers kill...for no good reason at all."</p>

<p>"Sick."</p>

<p>He sighed. "Call me if you remember anything."</p>

<p>When he was gone, Buffy came and sat next to Faith on the step, and Cordelia and Willow
sat on the one below. Faith wrapped her arms around her partner.</p>

<p>"I'm not like them. I'm not. I'm one of the good guys."</p>

<p>"I sure think so." Buffy agreed.</p>

<p>"Me too." Willow agreed.</p>

<p>"Me three." Cordelia added.</p>

<p>"Me four." Xander said, coming over with Oz.</p>

<p>"Me five." The guitarist said.</p>

<p>"We're figurin' out what's goin' on, tonight, then we're gonna find some vampires," Faith
spoke, the fire coming back, "and I'm gonna do my job."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The slayers entered Allan's office quietly, and started to look around the dark room. The
immorality of breaking and entering crossed their minds, especially because they had
already committed a major immoral act already, but they were both positive something not
so good was going on in City Hall. And that made what they were doing easier.</p>

<p>"You brought this up," Faith said, "so you're thinkin', what? Conspiracy?"</p>

<p>"I don't know if it's X-Files-esque in bigness, but yeah."</p>

<p>"So no Smoking Man." Faith sighed.</p>

<p>As Buffy went over to the file cabinets, Faith went over to his desk and searched his
inbox. Just interoffice envelopes. Her eyes traveled to a picture of him and the Mayor,
Richard Wilkins III. She picked up the picture, and after a few moments, had to close her
eyes. The pain hit her again, as well as the guilt.</p>

<p>She felt Buffy's eyes on her, and held up the picture. The blonde frowned, and they both
just stood there for a minute, until Buffy remembered the file cabinets she had been
opening. Crooking her finger, she beckoned the other slayer over. Faith set the picture
down, and Buffy began showing her the cabinets' contents.</p>

<p>"Empty." The brunette said.</p>

<p>"Completely."</p>

<p>Faith went back to the desk, and began looking through the drawers. They were empty too.
She went to shut the top one, disappointed. Then, on a hunch, she reached in and felt the
top of the drawer. Her fingers touched something. She yanked, and whatever it was, came
loose. It was a day planner.</p>

<p>Before they could look through it, they heard voices coming from the hallway.  The slayers
crept to the door, and Buffy opened it just enough so they could look without being seen.
They weren't expecting what they saw. Trick and the Mayor were walking down the hallway,
talking.</p>

<p>"Get as many men on it as you can. We don't have near enough evidence to put 'em away, so
plans will have to change." The Mayor said to the vampire.</p>

<p>"Yeah. We'll be wanting to turn up the heat."</p>

<p>"Holy -" Faith whispered.</p>

<p>"Crap." Buffy finished.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"The Mayor of Sunnydale's a black hat, and Trick's workin' for him. I should've known he'd
go for the top guy." Faith seethed, as they walked to Restfield. "What's it say?"</p>

<p>Buffy was reading Allan's planner. "Something called 'Hundred Days' happened yesterday, he
was supposed to call somebody about a delivery, and in like a month, he has 'Ascension'
written down. Why's that date sound familiar?"</p>

<p>"How much you wanna bet he was tryin' to give us a heads up? He wasn't in that alley just
for the sights, and that book wasn't taped in that drawer for nothin'."</p>

<p>"Then this planner was his back up in case something happened to him. He must've expected
-"</p>

<p>"He expected the Mayor to get to 'em. Not someone he was comin' to for help." The brunette
spat.</p>

<p>They walked past the gates and into the cemetery. After a few feet, Buffy grabbed Faith's
arm, and turned her around.</p>

<p>"Tell me."</p>

<p>"Tell you what?"</p>

<p>"What I can do." She sighed. "You're beating yourself up over this. I know I didn't
actually do...but I was there. I'm feeling sick, and dirty, and pretty low, too. Maybe not
in the same way you are, but I am. I don't know what to say, how to help..."</p>

<p>"You are, Buffy. Don't you know that? If I need you, I know you're there. And you're not
leavin' me out to dry. No matter how much I want all the blame. Really isn't anything to
say. We've done that. I'll be okay...eventually. Just keep stickin' by me."</p>

<p>"Can do." They grasped hands, and started looking for vampires. "I should go to school and
tell Giles what we found out tomorrow. Do you wanna -?"</p>

<p>A branch snapped somewhere, and their sensitive hearing picked it up right away. They
stealthily moved down the rows of graves, searching for the source. Faith was glancing at
the names on the headstones as they went by, and one made her stop. The Deputy Mayor's.
The Mayor had hurried the funeral, and they had had it just after noon that day.</p>

<p>Without thinking, she just knelt down in front of it. Buffy was a couple steps ahead, and
when she realized she was alone, she backtracked. She thought about telling Faith that
they might be in danger, but she didn't want to interrupt her. She just stood behind the
brunette, and looked as well.</p>

<p>"You were lookin' for us, and when we figure out what's goin' down, we'll stop it. I get
the feelin' that's what you wanted, and that's what will do. Promise. And I never meant
to...I'm...sorry. We're sorry." Faith sighed. "Rest in peace."</p>

<p>She looked up at Buffy, and they smiled at each other. Then the next thing they knew, a
net was falling down over them. Wesley had come out from behind a mausoleum, flanked by
three other men, who had thrown the net.</p>

<p>"By the order of the Watcher's Council of Britain, I am exercising my authority and
removing you to England, where you will accept the judgment of the disciplinary
committee."</p>

<p>"How did you find out?" Buffy asked, struggling to get free.</p>

<p>"As a Watcher, it is my job to know everything that happens with my charges at all times."</p>

<p>"You idiot!" Faith yelled. "You're shippin' two slayers off, away from the Council's
biggest trouble spot?"</p>

<p>He didn't say anything, and they started to be dragged off.</p>

<p>"Look out! Vampires!" Buffy screamed.  The four men scattered immediately, fleeing like
the wusses she knew they were. It allowed her and Faith to get free. When their
"abductors" stood up from behind the graves they were using to hide, they were very
confused. She looked at the lackeys. "Beat it."</p>

<p>Wesley cowered as his friends ran off, and the blonde pushed him onto the ground. She
crouched, gripped his tie, and yanked. She really hated the Council. Did they even hear of
the words "human being" and "delicate situation"? You didn't abduct your employees. They
were so out of touch with the world it wasn't even funny.</p>

<p>Faith watched Buffy glare at the watcher, and could see how frightened he was. He was
still a person, and seeing the anger in her partner, was scaring her. Images of the alley
came to her, and she didn't even want that to be a possibility. Ever again.</p>

<p>She put her hand on Buffy's shoulder. "Let 'em up, B. As much as he deserves a hit, he's
not worth the energy." The blonde nodded in hesitant agreement, and Wesley scrambled to
his feet. "Get the hell out of here, Wes. We're not goin' anywhere."</p>

<p>When he was gone, they headed home.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"You were just acting on instinct, you know." Buffy said to Faith as they lied in bed. "I
know you think you should've seen that he wasn't a vampire, and known not to..."</p>

<p>Faith sighed. They had been lying there awhile, feeling slightly better than they had. It
wasn't worth bringing up Wesley, or the Council, because that was just stupid. It was over
and done with, and they knew he wasn't going to try again. Even he wasn't *that* stubborn.
But Buffy had a reason for bringing this up, and she hoped it would work.</p>

<p>"Those killer whales we saw on that boat tour acted on instinct. I'm human. I'm supposed
to be able to have higher thought processes or whatever."</p>

<p>"But you're a human who's also a Slayer. We have to listen to our instincts. It's what
keeps us alive. We both were in survival mode cause Balthazar's cronies were coming out of
nowhere."</p>

<p>"So that makes us like those whales? Animals?"</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head.  "Animals don't care."</p>

<p>"Maybe that'd be easier. Not being able to care."</p>

<p>"Angel didn't care during his killing spree days. He could just do it, and forget. But
then it caught up with him. Be glad you care, cause if you didn't, bad stuff would catch
up with you eventually."</p>

<p>"Where'd this come from, B?"</p>

<p>"I've just been thinking. I grabbed him on instinct. Then you..."</p>

<p>"Instinct. Yeah, you said."</p>

<p>"But what if we were on different sides? Then you would've given him to me, and I
would've...done it. It would've happened no matter what. Some things we can't stop.
There's nothing wrong with you, and even if there was, then there'd be something wrong
with me too."</p>

<p>Faith didn't speak, and Buffy took that to mean she had said something wrong.</p>

<p>"I just wanted to help. I know you said...but I needed to say something...and I should
have kept my big mou -"</p>

<p>Her explanation was cut short, as the brunette leaned over and brought their lips
together. What the blonde said made an awful lot of sense. Giles had been motivational,
Angel had been reassuring, Willow had been comforting, and the gang had tried to keep her
positive as a whole. That had all helped her, but not as much as Buffy just had.</p>

<p>She did think there was something wrong with her. That if it had been anyone else in that
alley, Allan would still be alive. And that was the one thing she knew that she'd never be
able to cope with. A flaw within herself. If her slaying abilities were less than perfect,
if she couldn't tell the difference between a vampire and a person, she'd have to stop.
And she loved slaying. It made her feel useful, a part of something good.</p>

<p>But Buffy's whole explanation on instinct and switching places clicked with her. Made her
feel better. She was perfectly fine. Though it was depressing to think that Allan was
destined to die now. Of course, they'd never be able to test it out. (She wouldn't want
Buffy to go through the pain anyway.) They couldn't prevent it. The only way it might not
have happened was if the Eliminati hadn't been after them, or they had a time machine to
go back and stop their doubles. Neither of those was possible though. They didn't have any
control over those things.</p>

<p>It also reminded her why Buffy was still the only one she could really talk to.
Because the older slayer *got* her. Who knew what was going on in her head. It may take
Buffy awhile to get her thoughts together, but she knew exactly what to say. Faith
remembered then, what she had forgotten to say lately. Sure it had only been a day, but
when the minutes seemed like hours and the hours seemed like years, it had been a long
time.</p>

<p>Faith spoke as she was attacking the blonde's mouth.</p>

<p>"I. Ove. Ou. O. Uch." Her words weren't very clear. For obvious reasons. She pulled away.
"What I meant to say -"</p>

<p>"Was, 'I love you so much'? Ditto."</p>

<p>Buffy understood her when she couldn't even get actual words out?</p>

<p>"I do, ya know. And I know you've been hurting too. I haven't really been there for ya.
You've been -"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it. If I need you, I know you're there, and that's enough."</p>

<p>The brunette smiled as the blonde was echoing her earlier words.</p>

<p>"When I wasn't thinkin' about...'the badness'...I was thinkin' about you, and what we did
before this all happened. It kept the dark thoughts away for a little while. How did we
get from That, to the Night and the Day from Hell?"</p>

<p>"Life likes to throw slayers curves. I have experience."</p>

<p>"And in an attempt to try and be positive, I say again, we should be glad it doesn't throw
us high ones. Then we'd be on our asses, and be really screwed."</p>

<p>"Hey, Miss Sunshine's back!" Faith smirked. "We could, um, get back to That, you know. I
always feel close to you, but when we did That, I felt like we were one person. I need to
feel that again."</p>

<p>"You read my mind, B."</p>

<p>"And it's so..."</p>

<p>"Come 'ere." Faith said with a grin, as she leaned down to kiss her again, all the while
slipping the nightshirt the blonde was wearing, off.</p>

<p>Angel moved away from the window with a smile, and gave them their privacy.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p> Crack. Crack. Dodge. Spin. Thrust. Crack.</p>

<p>The gang looked on, in the library, as Faith and Buffy trained with staffs. It was about
two in the afternoon. As soon as the slayers had come in, in the morning, they noticed
immediately that the brightness had returned. Especially with Faith. It was a very nice
thing to see. Buffy had given Giles Allan's planner, and he started off into research
mode. The slayers also told him what Wesley did, and he was not very happy. Not one bit.</p>

<p>Crack. Thrust. Crack. Swipe. Parry. Thrust. Crack.</p>

<p>Buffy had made up her Chemistry test, and training was a way for her to get her mind off
her nervousness and possible failure. Faith was happy to oblige her, as she needed to get
back into the groove.</p>

<p>Get back to be being a slayer. She was ready. Nothing was going to get in her way.
Not Wesley or anyone. She had made her peace with Allan. Now, there were people out there,
who were in danger. She would be there for them.</p>

<p>Thud.</p>

<p>"Somebody's on their game." Buffy said, flat back on the mat.</p>

<p>"Thanks." Faith flashed her a smile.</p>

<p>She helped the blonde to her feet, and they went to sit.</p>

<p>"You two are...good?" Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah. I've dealt. It's not gone, it'll never be, totally, but I've dealt." Faith said, as
Buffy was nodding. "That goes for both of us."</p>

<p>"Very entertaining." Xander said throatily, his mind still on the training. He saw
Cordelia's glare. "You had...good staff control."</p>

<p>"Good staff control?" Willow asked, trying not to laugh.</p>

<p>"You need to work on your recoveries, man."</p>

<p>"Thanks for the tip, Oz." Xander shrank in his seat.</p>

<p>"Anytime."</p>

<p>"Despite his phrasing, Xander is correct. You're very proficient with the quarter-staffs."
Wesley said, having watched from out in the hall.</p>

<p>"How dare you come back here." Buffy snapped at him.</p>

<p>He flinched. "I called the Council back, and explained to them my mishandling of the
Balthazar situation, and my hastiness and uncalled for approach last night. They were
not...pleased. You'll not be sent to England. I spoke with Mr. Giles earlier today, and
after he was done...reprimanding me, he explained the circumstances in which the Deputy
Mayor's death occurred. I ask for your forgiveness."</p>

<p>"You've got some brass ones. I'm surprised." Faith said.</p>

<p>"Yes, well, the Council also asked me to tell you this. Because of my mistakes, they're
offering you a choice. If you wish, a new watcher can replace me, and I shall return to
England. I would not blame you, if you did."</p>

<p>The slayers looked at each other, and then at the gang. He was so pathetic and sniveling,
that they felt sorry for him. They couldn't send him off to the Mother Country.</p>

<p>"You can stay." Buffy sighed. Sometimes, she was just too damn nice for her own good.</p>

<p>Wesley smiled. "Thank you. I promise that from now on -"</p>

<p>"Yeah, yeah. Just go help Giles." Faith said.</p>

<p>"Yes. Right away."</p>

<p>He disappeared into Giles' office, and they all just kind of sat there for a minute with
smirks on their faces, before Xander spoke.</p>

<p>"See? He thinks you have good staff control too. So there."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Back in Restfield that night, there were vampires. Four of them to be exact. And one of
them was Trick. As he stood back and watched his boys get dusted, Faith hoped that this
wasn't what he meant when he talked to the Mayor about "turning up the heat", because this
was just ridiculous. But by the shock on his face, she could tell it was.</p>

<p>As she and Buffy finished off the remaining two, attacking vampires, with their patented
synchronized slaying routine, Trick walked up to them. He made it seem like it was with no
fear, but his eyes betrayed him. Faith silently told Buffy to hang back, and went to meet
him.</p>

<p>"I underestimated you, girl. I thought you'd still be in denial. Vulnerable. Past
experience shows me that's how you work."</p>

<p>"Not anymore. I don't hide, I don't run. Your timin' is off, Trick."</p>

<p>"She get you to open up? Well, she'll just have to be taken out."</p>

<p>"Over my dead body."</p>

<p>"That's the idea." Trick smiled. "Poor Mr. Finch, huh? I figured when I threatened him
he'd find you, but -"</p>

<p>"You sent him out there?"</p>

<p>"When you threaten someone's life, they tend to panic. He was becoming a liability. Too
much of a conscience. We needed to get rid of him, and I convinced the Honorable Mayor of
that, but he didn't want to 'soil the office.' Know what I'm sayin'?"</p>

<p>"You wanted him dead? The Mayor wanted him dead?"</p>

<p>"I thought for sure one of those Eliminati chumps would do it before he could get to you,
but imagine my surprise when I found out you did it. The one he came to for protection."</p>

<p>Faith's blood was boiling. It had been planned all along. If it wasn't for Trick...</p>

<p>"Aren't you forgetting who has the power here? Say hi to Kakistos for me."</p>

<p>She shoved her stake into his chest.</p>

<p>"Oh no. No, this is no good at all." Trick said, just before he crumbled into ashes.</p>

<p>"Bastard." She hissed.</p>

<p>Buffy came over then. "He definitely was."</p>

<p>"And now he's dead. For good this time around."</p>

<p>'That was for you, Allan.'</p>

<p>They started to make their way out.</p>

<p>"So...what do ya wanna do now?" Faith asked.</p>

<p>"Hmm...PlayStation?"</p>

<p>"Do we have any non-violent games? I'm not in the mood for violence right now."</p>

<p>Buffy thought. "Don't think so...but we could rent one."</p>

<p>"All PlayStation games are pretty much...unless you count...driving ones and Crash
Bandicoot."</p>

<p>"Nah." They both said.</p>

<p>"Oh. You can rent systems too." Buffy remembered. "How about Nintendo 64?"</p>

<p>"Mario! Damn I used to love that. Remember we could never get the second whistle in the
3rd one?"</p>

<p>"And Big World?"</p>

<p>"That was too damn hard." Faith smiled. "Forget the new one, you still got the original
system?"</p>

<p>"You know...I think I do. And Xander's got some games. His machine is broken, so
he can't play them, though."</p>

<p>"Guess where we're stoppin' at?"</p>

<p>"We might as well call everybody. They all grew up on Nintendo. Even Cordelia, but she
won't admit it."</p>

<p>"Let's get a move on then."</p>

<p>Faith grinned, and ran ahead.</p>

<p>"Hey! Wait up!"</p>
