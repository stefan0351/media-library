<!-- The Woes of Myth and Language \ Story -->

<p>She had had her first classes earlier that day. It was still August, still summer, and she was going back to school. Okay, so maybe there was only five days left in the month, but still…there was something wrong about that. When she was high school she started in September. Everyone loved that extra week off. But she would soon get back into the everyday routine of college. It wasn't like she had a choice.</p>

<p>Along with Willow and Xander, she had chosen a mythological studies course, which they would all have tomorrow. They didn't know anything about who the professor was. Only that he or she was new, and apparently very knowledgeable on the subject. Willow had, of course, taken drama, and Buffy got much amusement out of reminding her that she'd have to put on a play eventually. Something she planned to do often.</p>

<p>Willow's only response was that she hoped it wasn't "Death of a Salesman".</p>

<p>Whereas she and Willow were still undecided on their majors, Xander had chosen English, on the advice of a professor from his summer session. Willow was thinking about possibly being a Science, or Elementary Ed major. Buffy figured the obvious choice for her was Criminal Justice, but did she really want to deal with the dregs of society? She already had to face creatures that were supposed to be evil, she didn't know if she could handle humans who made a choice to be evil.</p>

<p>But speaking of evil creatures, she saw three vampires up ahead of her in the park. They were hovering around a bench. Pulling out a stake, she ran up to them.</p>

<p>"Hey!" She yelled. They looked up at her, growling in annoyance. "Isn't it a little late for you to -"</p>

<p>That's when she saw what they were doing. There was a homeless man lying on the bench, still covered by a newspaper. She could see the wounds on his neck, but couldn't tell if he was dead or not. When she yelled, told him to run, and he didn't move, she figured that wasn't a good sign. Pissed at herself for letting it happen, she turned her anger into fuel to dust the man's killers.</p>

<p>Not even bothering with a witty comment, she allowed them to advance toward her. Two covered her sides, the third, got in front. The one she was facing started the attack. It threw a punch, and she shot her hand out, catching the fist. Raising her leg, she kicked the vampire in the chest, and sent him flying. His friends charged her then, and she dropped to avoid being crushed.</p>

<p>They knew they weren't going to hit her, so they stopped short, just before they collided with one another. Buffy slid out from underneath their legs, and jumped up, surprising the two vampires. She bashed their heads together, and they fell to the grass. One was smart enough to grab her leg on its way down and pull, which caused her to lose her balance, and fall onto her back.</p>

<p>The one she had taken down first was angry, and had come rushing back to join the others. It jumped on top her, not knowing that she had her stake up against her chest, pointed in the air. When he landed, he landed on the wooden point, ending his unlife. She was more than ready to take down the other two, but as she got to her feet, she saw them running off. She thought about chasing them, but she wouldn't have caught up.</p>

<p>Instead, she walked over to the bench and said a silent apology to the deceased man. His wide-open, frightened eyes sent chills through her body. She had to look away.</p>

<p>"Bastards." She muttered under her breath. The sad part was, nobody would miss him.</p>

<p>"I'd have to agree." She turned sharply, to come face to face with Krischten. "They have poor taste."</p>

<p>"You're why they ran, aren't you?" The master vampire just stayed focused on the dead man. "I would've killed them."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt."</p>

<p>"First you beat me, then you help me. Make up your mind."</p>

<p>"Help you?"</p>

<p>He wasn't one for explanations, or thrilling conversation, Angel had been right about that. Buffy figured now was a good a time as any to ask him a question that had been plaguing her.</p>

<p>"You're supposed to be dead, you know." He stared at her now. She realized that she had yet to see his vampiric face. She guessed when you lived that long as a vampire, control came easily. "Why aren't you?"</p>

<p>The next thing she saw was his hand waving in front of her face. A second later, she was standing completely by herself, next to an empty bench. She could have sworn there was…oh well. It was probably nothing. Just her overactive imagination. Shaking her head, she decided to end patrol for the night, and head back to the dorms.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Books and papers surrounded Giles, as he sat at his desk. He had a single lamp on, giving him just enough light so that he would be able to see himself writing. He was so engrossed in his task, that he didn't know Spike had entered his home until he coughed from the second-hand smoke the vampire was producing. He glared at him, and went back to his work.</p>

<p>"Looking busy, Rups." Spike commented.</p>

<p>"I am. And would you please put that out?" He heard Spike walk into his kitchen, and then stamp his foot. He grimaced. He should have been more specific and told him to use an ashtray. "I don't have any blood."</p>

<p>"I'm hurt. You really think I come here just to eat? For your information, I went to the butcher." Giles heard his microwave door opening, and looked up at Spike. "Mine was broken, all right?"</p>

<p>"Fine. Just…try not to make a mess."</p>

<p>Focusing on his papers again, Giles shook his head. No, that wasn't it. He had to get it right. This was important. He crossed out what he had just written, and started over. After a few seconds, he put the pen down, and started to massage his forehead.</p>

<p>When the microwave dinged, Spike took out his dinner, pulled up a chair, and sat by Giles. He watched the ex-watcher give him a look of disgust as he began to feed. That only made it more enjoyable. Finishing it all at once, he shifted his face back to its human form, and wiped his hand across his blood stained lips. He smiled at Giles.</p>

<p>"That hit the spot. Better than any ol' tea."</p>

<p>"Somehow I think our opinions would differ. Don't ever do that in front of me again."</p>

<p>Spike glanced down at what Giles had been working on. "Somebody's testy. What's got you all riled up? Research for some big, nasty evil?"</p>

<p>"Could be. It all depends on how I look at it, I suppose."</p>

<p>Confusion played across Spike's face, as he was left somewhat speechless by the strange answer he had received.</p>

<p>"Anyway," Spike said finally, "I heard humors about a new 'big gun' in town. Every demon in this whole bloody place is spooked."</p>

<p>"Including you?"</p>

<p>"Me? Buy into tales from Etrevak demons and newborns? Piffle." The de-fanged vampire said, trying to appear tough. "But…it might help the blokes if I could go back and tell them, you know, for sure, that there's nothing to worry about. Just to ease their nerves and all."</p>

<p>Giles skimmed the book in front of him, searching. "I have no idea what you're talking about. And frankly, even if I did know something, I wouldn't be forthcoming with any information."</p>

<p>"Why the hell not?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's always the possibility that you'd take the knowledge I'd provide you with, join forces with the evil being, and help it develop a plan to kill us all, to avoid being killed yourself. Of course, I do I have a tendency to be overly cautious and to let my imagination run away with me from time to time. I mean, it's not like you've done anything remotely like that in the past."</p>

<p>Finding what he was looking for, Giles went back to writing.</p>

<p>"Laying it on a bit thick aren't you?" When Spike realized he wasn't going to get anywhere, he stood up, outraged. "Fine. I try to be personable, somewhat friendly…but one little stab in the back and they never trust you again."</p>

<p>"This may come as a surprise, but we never have."</p>

<p>"Sod off." Spike flung the door open. "Hope you don't die horribly anytime soon. Oh, wait. Yes I do."</p>

<p>"Good night, Spike. Oh, and be careful on your way home. You never know what could be lurking about."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The following day, Buffy met up with Xander and Willow after her Calculus class. That was a big mistake. What had possessed her to sign up for that? Numbers and letters weren't her thing. It was a wonder she could speak the English language. Ceasing her pondering for the moment, she realized that the gang was now back together in school, and headed towards their shared mythological studies class. She smiled.</p>

<p>"How'd drama class go?" She asked Willow.</p>

<p>"Good. We're working on finding our 'motivation' for scenes. It's tough. Reaching inside and thinking of memories to draw from and stuff…causes brain pain."</p>

<p>"Aww, you shouldn't have to feel brain pain. Should she, Xander?"</p>

<p>"Nope. Nobody needs that. Or brain freeze." He said, backing Buffy up.</p>

<p>"And don't worry, Will," Buffy put her arm around her, "you seem plenty motivated to me."</p>

<p>"Damn right she is." Xander agreed.</p>

<p>Willow giggled. "Thanks guys."</p>

<p>"What do you say we get some grub after this? I've got a nice, long, two hour break coming up and -" He stopped speaking as they began to walk past the lounge and he noticed the 'Lesbian Alliance' banner hanging there. "That looks like a fine, upstanding club. Plan on joining?"</p>

<p>Willow coughed, looked around, and then slapped Xander's arm. "No. Why would we do that?"</p>

<p>"You want me to give you the obvious answer?"</p>

<p>"We're not lesbians, Xander." Buffy told him, matter-of-factly.</p>

<p>"We're not." Willow reinforced with a nod.</p>

<p>"I hate to break this to you, but technically -" Xander started to explain slowly, but was then interrupted.</p>

<p>"I don't like girls. I like Willow. I'm…I'm a Willbian."</p>

<p>"I see." He said, looking at his friends like they were crazy. "And let me guess. Willow's a Buffbian?"</p>

<p>The girls burst into laughter. Now everyone was looking at them strangely.</p>

<p>"And darn proud of it!" Willow said, her head held high.</p>

<p>When they reached the door to the classroom, they had settled down somewhat. Until they saw who the professor was, that is.</p>

<p>"Giles?!" Three voices spoke in questioning disbelief.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Anya emerged out of the dimensional portal and found herself in a clearing in the middle of Breakers Woods. Three months she had journeyed. Well, a couple hundred years if you went by the other dimensions calendars. And did anything come out of her travels? Did she have her powers back? No.</p>

<p>She went through Ta'Hoffren's trials, traversed landscapes unimaginable to any human being, defeated the creepiest demons she had ever seen out of anger and hate (two emotions that were key for vengeance demons), and had survived with all her body parts intact. But it had all been for nothing. And Ta'Hoffren had been nice enough to explain why.</p>

<p>The bastard.</p>

<p>It was because she felt love for a male. A member of the race she used to torture. Just because she loved one, she couldn't be vengeful? Man was that a rip off. Oh well. It was best to shrug it off and except her situation. She didn't need to be a demon, right? She had Xander. She would just go to the basement, they would have sex, and everything would be fine.</p>

<p>Everything would be fine.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>They listened to "Professor Giles", still stunned. They sat in silence as he introduced himself and the course to his students. Which included them. They were Giles' students. There was something unsettling about that. This was a man they had faced numerous beasts of hell with, and now they'd have to hand him assignments. Oh god. He'd grade them too. Trying not to dwell, they tuned into what he was saying.</p>

<p>"Hello, everyone. My name is Rupert Giles, and welcome to World Mythological Studies. This is a fairly new course, and the university has a very broad outline for this class. I've been told that I'm free to teach whatever I deem appropriate.</p>

<p>"I'll have a more specific syllabus for you all the next time we meet, but I hope to cover myths and legends from the Greeks, Romans, and Celts. Please bare with me, this is the first time I've taught, but hope this will be enjoyable for you. What do you say we delve right into our first myth?"</p>

<p>As Giles headed to the chalkboard, Xander turned to the girls and whispered.</p>

<p>"I can't believe I'm going to say this, but it might actually be fun."</p>

<p>They nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>Giles was writing as he spoke. "You will need to purchase books, and I've been told they'll be available at the campus store tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Yep." Xander confirmed for the rest of the class. "Thirty big ones."</p>

<p>The students seemed to groan as one.</p>

<p>"I'd hide. People don't like guys who take their money." Buffy advised.</p>

<p>"You'll protect me, right?"</p>

<p>"You're taking my cash too. Well, my mom's, but…"</p>

<p>Xander paled and looked to the chalkboard. Giles had written, 'THESEUS AND THE MINOTAUR' on it.</p>

<p>"Does anyone know anything about this story?" Giles asked.</p>

<p>"Hey, isn't that a half-man, half-bull thing?" A girl asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah, and it was made because some chick had sex with a bull." A guy chipped in.</p>

<p>The girl gave him a look of disgust.</p>

<p>"You're both right." Giles said. "However I was thinking more along the lines of Thesesus, who was the son of the god Poseidon, going into the Labyrinth where the beast was trapped. He killed it after finding his way through the maze-like corridors."</p>

<p>"Why would he want to do that?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Teach us, Professor." Buffy teased.</p>

<p>"I was just getting to that, Miss Summers." Giles said, hiding a grin. "All right. A gentleman named Minos became king of Crete and took a beautiful maiden named Pasiphae, as his wife…"</p>

<p>After class was over, everyone had cleared out except for Buffy, Willow, and Xander. Giles came up to them.</p>

<p>"How was it?" He asked, worried.</p>

<p>"You did good, Giles." Buffy reassured him. "You're the best teacher I've ever had. So much better than Walsh."</p>

<p>"I think I might actually remember this stuff tomorrow." Xander said.</p>

<p>"Well, mission accomplished then." Giles said with a smile.</p>

<p>"Was the Minotaur really able to create illusions to trick the people trapped inside the maze? I've never heard that before." Willow asked.</p>

<p>"It was some form of powerful hypnotic suggestion, yes."</p>

<p>"Neat." Willow looked at her friends. "We ready to eat?"</p>

<p>"Uh huh." Xander said.</p>

<p>"See you later, Giles." Buffy said. "Don't work too hard."</p>

<p>"I'd say the same to you, but then you'd probably listen to me for once."</p>

<p>"He's a barrel of laughs, isn't he?" Buffy asked her friends as they exited the classroom.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Xander returned home after his day of learning, to get the last of his things and take them to his new dorm room. His roommate was okay. Didn't spend much time in the dorm anyway. When he was, he went right to sleep. Xander could only guess why the guy was so tired all the time. But it was a pretty good guess. It started with and 'S', ended with an 'X', and there was a vowel in the middle.</p>

<p>That got him thinking about Anya, obviously. He missed her. He wondered how she was, if she was hurt, if she had succeeded in what she had set out to do…as he made his way down to the basement, he sincerely hoped she hadn't, and that she'd come back soon. Imagine his surprise then, when he saw her sitting on his bed, with her arms crossed over her chest, looking very upset.</p>

<p>"Anya! You're back!"</p>

<p>"Where were you? I waited all day and you never showed. You were supposed to wait for me. You were supposed to be here. We were going to have 'come back' sex."</p>

<p>"It's been three months, you know." He pointed out.</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"I don't live here anymore. I'm in college with Buffy and Willow. I moved into a dorm. I even got a steady job."</p>

<p>"What?" She asked, jumping off the bed. "You…you…didn't you stop to think how I would feel?"</p>

<p>"I thought you'd be happy for me. I have direction and all that good stuff." Xander said, getting the feeling Anya didn't like his news.</p>

<p>"Well I'm not! What am I supposed to do all day now? Have orgasms by myself? That's enjoyable for awhile but -"</p>

<p>"Hey. I still love you. We're still together. And we can still have sex."</p>

<p>"But it's not the same. Don't you see that? We can only do it like twice a day!"</p>

<p>"Can you at least pretend to support me?" He started to get a little angry now.</p>

<p>Anya was quiet for awhile. Things weren't like she expected them to be. Xander wasn't the same. But what choice did she have? Love was a real pain in the ass sometimes.</p>

<p>"Fine." She gave in. "But I still don't like this."</p>

<p>"Thank you." Xander said, and then kissed her. "So…"</p>

<p>"If you're wondering if I got my powers back, the answer is no." He sighed in relief. "I'm depressed. I don't like depression. We haven't been together, and I come back, and we can't -"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't really have anything to do at the moment…"</p>

<p>As soon as Anya heard that, she jumped him, and he fell onto the bed.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Around the same time that Xander and Anya were getting "reacquainted", Buffy and Willow were sitting on the floor of their dorm room. The slayer had just returned from patrol, aching. She had a feeling, like she had had the night before, that she had missed something. That more happened during patrol than she remembered. Which might explain why she was more achy and stiff than usual from a routine slaying. It was really beginning to bug her.</p>

<p>She wasn't sure what to do about her memory, but Willow definitely had the cure for achyness. Besides being a super hacker and an adept wicca, she was apparently great at massages. She knew this because Willow was currently giving her shoulders and neck the best massage they had ever had. Her fingers may have only been working on one part of Buffy's body, but the blonde felt every part of her relaxing.</p>

<p>As Willow worked on a really stubborn knot, Buffy hissed.</p>

<p>"Oh! Did I hurt you?" Willow said, backing away.</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head. "You kidding? Where did you learn…?" Willow simply smiled, and started again. "Ohh, who cares? Just keep working your magic, Will."</p>

<p>"Hey! That's right!" The redhead said excitedly, stopping and reaching under the bed.</p>

<p>"We seem to have a communications problem."</p>

<p>Willow grabbed the book she found, and started flipping through it.</p>

<p>"Sorry. You just…you said the 'M' word and I remembered…" She looked up. "Wanna help?"</p>

<p>"Sure." Buffy said with a smile, looking at the book. "What's the spell?"</p>

<p>Buffy was going to do magick with her? She suddenly got giddy.</p>

<p>"Uh…it's a Revealing Spell." Willow said, finding the spell.</p>

<p>"Cool. So what's it do?"</p>

<p>Willow's brow furrowed. "I'm not sure. I mean, I have an idea, but it's all hieroglyphics. I'm a little rusty in Egyptian."</p>

<p>"That's the one with all the pictures, right?"</p>

<p>"Yeah." Willow said with a chuckle. She pointed at the different symbols. "See?"</p>

<p>Buffy leaned in closer. Talk about a mind blower. It was all Greek to her. She continued to stare at it, and her eyes focused. Then something weird happened. She wasn't looking at the hieroglyphics any more; she was looking at letters. Words. It was English. She could understand it. Willow must have noticed her shock and how glued she was to the book.</p>

<p>"Buffy? What is it?"</p>

<p>"I can read it." Buffy explained softly.</p>

<p>Did she just hear right?</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean…I know what it says."</p>

<p>"Uh…how?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. One second I just saw little pictures, and the next…"</p>

<p>"So…what's it say?"</p>

<p>Buffy picked up the book. "It says…that this is a guiding spell in the unlikely event anyone happened to get trapped in the tombs…"</p>

<p>"Besides the dead Pharaoh that's supposed to be in them?"</p>

<p>"I think…it helps people through the tomb…and gets them out somehow…"</p>

<p>Willow was amazed. She was awed…but she didn't know what to say. "I guess it won't help us in any way then, huh?"</p>

<p>"Guess not." Buffy said, closing the book. "What's happening to me, Will?"</p>

<p>Bill Palmer and his two buddies were walking through the halls of UC Sunnydale at night. It was a twenty-four hour campus and they were residents, so all they had to do was check in with the security guard. They told him they were going to the library, but really, studying was the last thing on his mind. Bill was in World Mythological Studies, and as soon as that new professor had started teaching, he got an idea.</p>

<p>He told his friends, and now they were headed toward the classroom.</p>

<p>"Look, they said if we wanna join the frat, we gotta get something Greek. A myth counts, right?" Bill said.</p>

<p>"Gamma Alpha Kappa's the coolest frat on campus, Jack." Andy reminded his nervous friend.</p>

<p>Jack nodded his head. "I know…I know. You're sure he left his books here?"</p>

<p>"He locked him in the closet. Trust me." Bill said, as the came up to the door. "Pick the lock, Andy."</p>

<p>"Why do I have to do it?" Andy asked.</p>

<p>"Just do it."</p>

<p>Grumbling, Andy did it. When they got inside, they turned on their mini-flashlights. Hurrying to the back of the room, Bill and Jack shined their lights on the closet handle as Andy jimmied its lock too. On the high shelf, there were three books. Jack grabbed them and sat them on the desk. Bill started skimming through them.</p>

<p>"This isn't right." Jack said again, feeling guilty as hell.</p>

<p>"Man, will you relax? From the look of the guy he's got plenty old books just like this." Bill said. "Oh, this is great! This whole thing's in Greek!"</p>

<p>Jack walked back to the door. He didn't want to do this. The book he was looking at was open to an old drawing of the Minotaur in the Labyrinth. There was a slip of cloth sticking out in between one of the pages. Bill took it out, and there was a handwritten Greek on it.</p>

<p>"What the hell is that?" Andy asked. "An ancient bookmark?"</p>

<p>"Hey Jack. You can read Greek, right? Get over here."</p>

<p>Bill's reluctant friend came back over. "My grandfather was Greek. He taught me a little, but…"</p>

<p>"We need to know if this is the real deal." Bill said, handing Jack the cloth.</p>

<p>Jack took a deep breath and looked at the words. "Uh…If you wish to understand these stories of the Gods and their lower subjects…of Ares, Poseidon, Aphrodite, Dionysus, Hera…"</p>

<p>"Speed it up." Bill said.</p>

<p>Jack glared. "Respect these tales…be careful to follow what they teach…the Great Ones of Mount Olympus have blessed the words on this parchment…if fools and non-believers speak them aloud and do not heed what they say or the lessons of the Gods…" Jack stopped, and gulped.</p>

<p>"What?" Andy said, beginning to feel less than safe.</p>

<p>"They will be punished in the name of Zeus and experience these lessons firsthand. They will be made into believers. Even at the expense of their mortal lives."</p>

<p>"Bull." Bill said, grabbing the book. "This is good enough, let's get out of here."</p>

<p>A flash of lighting crackled through the air, and Bill not expecting it, dropped the book. Somehow, wind began to blow inside the room, and the book opened, pages fluttering. The three students ran for the door, but a large gust of wind knocked them down. The room began to glow a blinding gold, and when they could see again, they wished they were blind. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A muscular, deformed figure, that appeared to have the head of a bull, and the body of a man, snarled, screeched and howled all at once. They were paralyzed, and the Minotaur was looking at them as a predator looked at prey.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow went straight to Giles'. Willow was holding Buffy in a comforting embrace on the couch, as Giles tested Buffy's new "talent". She could read Gaelic, Sumerian, Native American, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, even Japanese. He was astounded. And dumbfounded.</p>

<p>"So you're saying I'm on my own with this?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"You're not on your own." Willow told her.</p>

<p>"I can make guesses, Buffy. I can tell you that it may be an extension of your Slayer abilities, a temporary flux of magickal energies…but the truth is that I'm inclined to believe that it does have to do with your long life as a slayer. As soon as I saw you reading, that's the first thought that entered into my mind."</p>

<p>"I'm kinda thinking that too." Buffy had to admit.</p>

<p>"That's the only remotely plausible explanation I can think of. But, again, it's just a theory." Giles said.</p>

<p>"Can't you research or something?" She wanted more concrete answers.</p>

<p>Giles knelt in front of her with a smile on his face. "Buffy, you are the only slayer to live this long. There's been nothing recorded or even speculated. I say this with all honesty and pride. You are the best slayer the world has ever had. It doesn't even seem like much of a stretch anymore to say that you are the true Chosen One.</p>

<p>"I don't see how this new ability can't be anything but beneficial to you. Accept it. If you start gaining new 'talents', then I'd embrace them as well. If they start to become a problem, then we'll deal with it accordingly. You know I'll look into this, but for now, consider what's happening to you as a bonus for a job well done."</p>

<p>Buffy pulled him up and gave him a hug.</p>

<p>"Well, it's about time I got something out of this 'destiny' thing."</p>

<p>"You're like all super-lingual." Willow said, excited,</p>

<p>"Where was this during high school, I ask you?"</p>

<p>"C&aacute;idh baineannach." Giles said in Irish Gaelic.</p>

<p>"Holy female? Really, Giles. You're just sucking up right…oh. I can understand it when it's spoken too."</p>

<p>"I probably butchered the pronunciation and used it -" Giles started, when the phone rang.</p>

<p>As he went to answer it, Buffy kissed Willow. Something she'd been wanting to do all day.</p>

<p>"Now if I ever go to France, I can curse at them in their own language."</p>

<p>"What if you get smarter than me?" Willow asked, suddenly feeling a little jealous.</p>

<p>"Not possible, Will. Besides, what do I need to speak different languages for? Tongues are better for so many other things."</p>

<p>Willow whimpered, and as they leaned in for another round, Giles came back. "Go away. Please?" She pleaded.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to interrupt, but that was Xander on the phone. He said he just got back to campus and that something, ah, really weird, was going on."</p>

<p>Both girls groaned, and Buffy said something very loudly in German. Giles looked shocked, as did Willow. As they were on their way out, the redhead sounded very upset.</p>

<p>"I know you probably have to slay right now, so I'll wait, but when we go home, I'm washing your mouth out with soap."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>They got to the campus, only it didn't look much like one anymore. It looked like a gigantic cave. The entire college building itself was transformed, but not the dorm halls. At least it was localized. They were more than a little hesitant to go charging inside. As they walked around the perimeter of the cave trying to figure out was going on, a voice spoke from behind them.</p>

<p>"Freaky, huh?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>Buffy felt her heart stop for a second, Willow had to hold back the scream that wanted to come out of her mouth, and Giles jumped.</p>

<p>"Don't -" Buffy started to yell at him.</p>

<p>"Sneak up on people?" Xander finished.</p>

<p>"Yes!" Buffy and Willow said together.</p>

<p>"What happened here, Xander?" Giles asked once he regained his composure.</p>

<p>Xander looked at the cave. "First there was a college building, then this." He shrugged.</p>

<p>"That's it?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"What were you expecting?"</p>

<p>Buffy led the group back around to the entrance, and two men, who weren't there a second ago, stood on either side. They were wearing togas and sandals, and looked very scared. If she didn't know any better, she'd say they were Ancient Greeks. But that wasn't possible.</p>

<p>"Go in." One said, fear evident in his voice.</p>

<p>"The beast requires four more to satisfy his hunger. He's had ten, and needs two more men, and two more women." The other one said.</p>

<p>Buffy looked at her friends. "Beast?"</p>

<p>"I don't like this." Willow said.</p>

<p>In the next second, they were all being thrust inside. They hit the dirt cave floor, and when they got to their feet, they couldn't see the entrance, the exit, or much of anything for that matter.</p>

<p>"Is everyone okay?" Giles asked.</p>

<p>"I will be once we find the way out." Xander said.</p>

<p>"And then get out." Willow added.</p>

<p>"Then let's get started." Buffy said, taking charge.</p>

<p>An inhuman howl suddenly sounded through the cavernous halls.</p>

<p>"That can't be good." Xander commented.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"The Minotaur." Giles said in a mix of fear and wonder.</p>

<p>Buffy faced her teacher and parental figure, and looked at him with her "you've got some explaining to do" expression. "Excuse me?"</p>

<p>"The men outside, feeding the 'beast' fourteen people, seven men and seven women, the howl, the passageways…we're in the Labyrinth."</p>

<p>"Whoa. Back the mythological truck up." Xander said. "Are you saying that the Ancient Greek myth about the man-bull who eats victims sent from Athens as a tribute to King Minos who ruled over Crete, is now in this cave, this Labyrinth, in Sunnydale, and we're trapped with it?"</p>

<p>After Giles got over his surprise that Xander had absorbed so much of his lesson, he answered him. "Yes. Exactly."</p>

<p>"Just checking." Xander said, rubbing his hands together. "So, who's for hiding?"</p>

<p>"How would it come to life, Giles?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"Did you bring the wrong book to class?" Buffy inquired, glaring.</p>

<p>"All the books were perfectly normal." Giles said, defending himself.</p>

<p>"Okay, forget the 'how did it get here' question. Let's go with the 'how do we kill it and leave' question."</p>

<p>"In the story, Theseus had that ball of string that showed him the way." Willow remembered.</p>

<p>"Anyone have magic string?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"No…" Buffy said, thinking. "But…we do have a spell."</p>

<p>"The revealing spell!" Willow exclaimed, wondering why she hadn't thought of it. "Oh. Wait. I don't have the book. And this isn't a tomb in a pyramid."</p>

<p>"It looks enough like a tomb to me, and I remember the spell. It's worth a shot. You'll have to say it, though. You are the witch in the group."</p>

<p>The Minotaur howled again.</p>

<p>"Can we hurry?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"You ready? Buffy asked. Willow nodded. "Just repeat what I say. Lost in the darkness, I pray for a light to guide me on my way." Willow repeated. "Guide me to safety, guide me away from harm. I ask the heavens to show me the right path. I -"</p>

<p>Buffy was interrupted as a group of Ancient Greek men appeared, and stood poised for battle. They began to advance. Fighting in darkened, enclosed, somewhat claustrophobic spaces, was something she liked to avoid. So, she did the only thing she could think of.</p>

<p>"Run!"</p>

<p>The gang was quick to follow her suggestion, and they took off down the passageways. Turning, twisting, they had no idea where they were going. They were driven simply by the need to escape the charging soldiers, who were on their heels. They reached two forks in the cave, and halted. There was total silence now. They didn't hear the men anymore.</p>

<p>"What the hell is going on?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"It must be a trick." Giles said. "The Minotaur can fool the human mind."</p>

<p>"Fool the mind?" Buffy asked herself quietly.</p>

<p>She started to get flashes. Of Krischten in the park the night before. Standing next to a dead homeless man on a bench. His hand waving in front of her, and then him taking the body, and leaving her there in a hypnotic state. Earlier tonight, fighting him, him leaving her hurt in the cemetery, before waving his hand in front of her again, and putting her into yet another, hypnotic state. Suddenly, she got all the answers she wanted.</p>

<p>"That's how he did it."</p>

<p>"Huh?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"Later." Buffy said, focusing back. "Let's try the - Willow?"</p>

<p>The wicca had gone over to the corner, and was holding her hand over her mouth. Buffy, Giles, and Xander went over and joined her. Once they saw what she was looking at, they did the same thing. There were bodies, well, parts of bodies, all in a pile. No one had time to comment though, because the Minotaur came rushing out of the left fork, and tackled Buffy to the ground.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Buffy!" Willow screamed.</p>

<p>The slayer was more revolted by the look and smell of the creature than anything else. She brought her fist up, and connected with its jaw. It recoiled, and she scrambled to her feet.</p>

<p>"Do the spell and get out!" Buffy screamed back, as she got cut on the side of her face by the Minotaur's claws.</p>

<p>"You can do it, Willow. Just try and focus." Giles said.</p>

<p>Willow tried to calm her breathing, and recall the spell.</p>

<p>"Lost in the darkness, I pray for -"</p>

<p>She felt something crawling. Lots of things crawling. All over her. Spiders. She started to scream and knock them off with her hands.</p>

<p>"Get off! Get off!"</p>

<p>"They're not real, Will." Xander said.</p>

<p>"Spiders! They're everywhere!"</p>

<p>She felt Xander grab her shoulders, and suddenly, she didn't see the spiders any longer.</p>

<p>"Okay?" He asked.</p>

<p>"Okay? Sure. Yeah." She said, trying to assure herself more than Xander. "How's Buffy doing?"</p>

<p>Buffy grabbed the creature by one of its horns, and yanked. It snarled in rage, and threw her up against the wall. She slid to the floor.</p>

<p>"She'll be fine. Concentrate." Giles said.</p>

<p>Willow started again. "Lost in the darkness, I pray for a light to guide me on my way. Guide me to safety; guide me away from harm. I ask the heavens to show me the right path. I - uh oh. What's the rest?"</p>

<p>Buffy brought her leg up, and connected with its face, It turned away from her, and she jumped onto its back.</p>

<p>"I implore you - OW!" Buffy said as the beast tried to shake off by backing up hard into a wall. She held on. "I implore you, let me see the way to freedom!"</p>

<p>Willow quickly finished the spell by saying what Buffy said, and then she, Xander and Giles watched as the fork the Minotaur had emerged from was bathed in blue light.</p>

<p>"Go!" Buffy told her friends.</p>

<p>They reluctantly began running, following the light. The Minotaur finally flung his nuisance off, and decided to try and run for the escapees. Once Buffy got to her feet, she chased after it.</p>

<p>"Now I'm pissed."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The rest of the group continued to follow the lighted passages, knowing the Minotaur was after them. They knew they must have been getting closer to the exit, because the brightness increased with each new corridor they went down. Then something they didn't expect happened. They hit a dead end.</p>

<p>"This is just…great!" Xander said, feeling very trapped.</p>

<p>"I don't get -" Willow started, and then got cut off by a growl.</p>

<p>The Minotaur grabbed her leg, and pulled her down. It was dragging her towards to it. She clawed at the ground, trying to resist, but it wasn't helping. Xander jumped for her hands, and grabbed them. He started to pull against the Minotaur, but soon he was being dragged too. He didn't let go of Willow, though. Giles, knowing it was foolish but going to do it anyway, ran up to the creature, hoping to distract it so it would release its hold.</p>

<p>It did, and just as it was about to swat Giles away, Buffy came running up behind it, and wrapped her arms around its neck. Willow and Xander, along with Giles, scrambled away as far as they could while Buffy wrestled with it. It couldn't knock her off this time, and using all the slayer strength she possessed, she snapped its neck, and it fell to the ground.</p>

<p>The dead end then became the exit, and they all immediately ran out. The cave slowly changed shape back into the familiar college they were used to.</p>

<p>"Everyone…okay?" Buffy panted, exhausted.</p>

<p>Three heads nodded a weary affirmative, and with that assurance, Buffy collapsed to the ground, too tired to stand. Willow was by her immediately, kissing her, glad she was alive. And she didn't even mind the overall dirtiness of Buffy's face. The blonde somehow found the strength to wrap her arms around the redhead, and they laid, kissing, in the grass.</p>

<p>Giles and Xander looked away. As Xander was looking at the ground, he noticed a book by his feet. He picked it up, and as he did, something fell out. Giles reached down and snatched the cloth.</p>

<p>"This yours?" Xander asked, referring to the book.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I have no clue how this got in there." He looked at the small piece of cloth. "I wonder what it is." Giles began reading it silently to himself.</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow had ceased their smooching session, and were now standing by the two men. Buffy noticed Giles' face, and took the cloth out of his hand. She began to read it.</p>

<p>"Care to explain this?" She asked.</p>

<p>"I have no idea where…I got the book from a garage sale last summer." Giles said, completely clueless.</p>

<p>"Uh huh." Buffy said, clearly not believing him. "Well, this is getting torn into little pieces."</p>

<p>As she went to tear it up, the cloth flew out of her hands, and into the air. It began to glow, and then they were looking at the almost surreal form of Zeus. They were in awed silence as he spoke.</p>

<p>"You are believers. Hopefully you have gained knowledge from this trial you have survived. Lesson learned."</p>

<p>And then, he was gone.</p>

<p>"O.…….kay." Buffy said, slowly.</p>

<p>"That pretty much blew my mind." Xander said, once he could speak again.</p>

<p>"No offense, Giles," Willow said, "but I'm really glad we don't have your class again until Thursday. I don't think I can handle any more myth stuff right now."</p>

<p>"I'm glad I don't have to teach it until Thursday." Giles said.</p>

<p>"Who wants to vedge?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>She was answered by the two raised, right hands of her fellow college-goers. Giles just wanted to sleep. The four of them wordlessly began to walk towards his house. They had an intense desire to not be around the college at the moment.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Krischten watched the Slayer and her friends leave the college grounds. By the looks of them, they had earned a rest. The Hellmouth was full of surprises, as he was quickly finding out. What pleased him, was that he knew the Slayer had begun to receive her rewards. Her mental abilities were sharper. She had seen through his mind games. Soon other abilities would follow. The Powers were so predictable.</p>

<p>Things were progressing nicely. He disappeared into the darkness with a smile on his face.</p>
