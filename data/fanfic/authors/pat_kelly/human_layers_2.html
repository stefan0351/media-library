<!-- Human Layers \ Part Two -->

<p>Cordelia moved through the lunch-line slowly, as she had to inspect every
offered food-like product cautiously and carefully, before she could decide
whether or not she wanted to risk her life and actually eat it. And it had
nothing to do with her figure, either. She was not one of those girls who stuck
to salads and emptied her stomach after every meal, but she knew people who did.
It was disturbing.</p>

<p>No, she was just afraid Sunnydale High was seriously breaking FDA
regulations.</p>
<p>She made her selection, went to the cash register, paid the buck sixty, and
scanned the cafeteria. It was pathetic when the only thing that looked remotely
appetizing was two-day old pizza. There they were. The trio. Xander, Willow,
and...Buffy. It was one damn kiss, but she couldn't let it go. She had had her
fun with guys before, and never had any trouble dropping them like a bad habit.
That was her specialty.</p>
<p>And it wasn't like they had done anything else. It just kept nagging at her.
Staying in her memory for more than five minutes. Buffy. No one had ever
accomplished that before. The thing was, it didn't make any sense. She didn't
like her, for one. Then again, Buffy kept saving her life, which made it harder
and harder to hate her. Could she have grown and not known it? Just the other
week, she had been rescued from a reanimated Daryl. Who told Buffy she wanted to
be saved?</p>
<p>Well technically, she did when she was screaming, but that was beside the
point.</p>
<p>There was *brief* physical contact, okay, but so what? She didn't even know
who Buffy was, really. But maybe she wanted to know her. Maybe she saw herself
in the slayer, yet unlike her, Buffy was comfortable with her place in high
school. That was something Cordelia wished she could do, but the possibility of
becoming an outcast scared her too much. Even though she didn't want to think
she was shallow. All her 'friends' were sheep; she wasn't stupid.</p>
<p>She was different, but she couldn't escape. Popularity was too cushy. When
she hung around with 'the gang' on rare occasions, she felt like she was a part
of something. If she researched, she had a purpose. Everyone thought it was just
charitable pity time, and she allowed them to think it. It was easier. Illusion
was easier than reality, and the reality was that things were crossing her mind
that she hadn't ever expected to cross her mind.</p>
<p>Purely for argument's sake, because she was someone who looked at all sides
of an issue, if she were willing to give up her social standing to turn
alternative and risk everything for Buffy, which she wasn't, Buffy was all over
Angel. Angel didn't glance at her with interest once, and that was simply wrong.
Though she did see why Buffy was the only thing he seemed to be able to think
about, because she seemed to be doing the same thing. Though there was an
upside.</p>
<p>She wasn't saying this aloud and boosting the other girl's ego.</p>
<p>Oh, and what ticked her off the most? Buffy was sitting there, at the table,
completely fine and not bothered. She even tried to use Angel to get her jealous
during the 'Daryl thing,' and couldn't tell if she'd been successful or not. It
made her mad. That's why she was going to head over, sit down, and see if the
slayer was the least bit shaken up.</p>

<p>Moving to their location, she silently asked herself why she cared.</p>
<p>By the time she considered changing her mind however, it was too late - she'd
been spotted.</p>
<p>"You've been forced into doing hard labor with Sheila the Schitzo, huh?
Snyder must have some twisted, 'I'm a little man with a head too big for my
body, with no appeal to either sex, so I have to be a pervert' fantasy about you
two or something." Cordelia parked herself down in the free seat.</p>
<p>"First, gross. It explains a lot, though." Buffy made a face.
"Second, I think Sheila's more a psycho than a schitzo. But believe me, I'm
in no hurry to get back. Gonna make lunch stretch for as long as possible."</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>"So...?" The cheerleader trailed off.</p>

<p>"Yeah...so...how come you aren't with your groupies?"</p>
<p>Cordelia narrowed her eyes. "They cut last period cause some store in
the mall is having a sale, I think. I don't know; I wasn't listening."</p>
<p>"And you didn't go?"</p>
<p>"Oh please. I order direct from the catalogs, or I go out of town to a
place with class."</p>
<p>"I should've known." The slayer smiled.</p>
<p>Cordelia looked at Buffy's tray. "You got French fries? They were out
when I went up."</p>
<p>"Do you want some?"</p>

<p>"Can I?"</p>
<p>"Be my guest."</p>
<p>It was at about this point, as Cordelia started snagging fries, that Willow
and Xander reminded the two girls that they were still there, and cleared their
throats.</p>
<p>"Buff, the enemy's at the table. The *Enemy*." Xander said,
concerned about his friend's...lack of concern.</p>
<p>"She's aware." Cordelia told him. "It's called keeping your
friends close and your enemies closer, Xander. It's a valid strategy. Look it
up."</p>
<p>"Actually, it's from the Godfather movies." Willow pointed out.

"Though if you rented them, I guess you could technically look it up...with
the fast-forward and rewind buttons and all."</p>
<p>"Cordelia can quote the greatest films of our time? No...no, this isn't
right at all." Xander was rather unnerved. "I'm just gonna resume
quietly plotting your death."</p>
<p>"You do that." The brunette said.</p>
<p>"Uh, the guys are gonna make stakes tomorrow before the Parent-Teacher
Night of Hell, cause there's some big vampire attack happening on Saturday.
Night of St. Vegetable...and...do you maybe, wanna help?" Buffy asked,
almost shyly.</p>
<p>"K." Cordelia replied, shrugging.</p>

<p>"You...but...you do?" Willow asked in disbelief.</p>
<p>Snatching another one of Buffy's fries, Cordelia knew she had her answer.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
<p>"So, what did you and Principal Snyder talk about, anyway?" Buffy
asked her mother as they walked outside of the school.</p>
<p>What a night. What a way to narrowly avoid her mom seeing what she did for a
living. Spike, the new vampire in town, chose not to wait until Saturday to
attempt to kill her. He attacked the school during the parent-teacher
conferences. Couldn't he have attacked a few minutes before Snyder went into
share-mode with her mother? The troll had put his own spin on her behavior, and
now she was in trouble.</p>
<p>It wasn't fair. Something told her she was going to come to hate Spike with a
passion. Her friends were safe, so that was good, but her mother had saved her.
That was embarrassing. She prepared herself for the incoming tirade.</p>
<p>"Principal Snyder said you were a troublemaker." Joyce answered,
watching her daughter hang her head. "And I could care less." Buffy
looked up. "I have a daughter who can take care of herself. Who's brave and
resourceful and thinks of others in a crisis. No matter who you hang out with or
what dumb teenage stuff you think you need to do, I'm gonna sleep better knowing
all that."</p>

<p>The slayer wore a suspicious expression on her face. "But how long till
this wears off and you start ragging on me again?"</p>
<p>"Oh, at least a week and a half."</p>
<p>"Very cool." Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>Wow. She wanted to question how she had managed to keep her freedom, but
decided not to look a gift slaying in the mouth. Maybe Spike deserved a 'thank
you' card instead of an ass kicking. All in all, yep, it had turned out all
right. Giles and Miss Calendar got the majority of the people to safety, Xander
and Angel bonded...err...perhaps bonded was the wrong word.</p>
<p>Hold up. How come it felt like she was missing something? She halted, going
over the night's events in her head.</p>
<p>"Oh crap."</p>
<p>"Buffy?" Joyce asked questioningly.</p>

<p>"Be right back, mom. I...I forgot something inside."</p>
<p>Like Cordelia and Willow. They had run out of the lounge, and then gotten
separated. She hadn't seen them come out, which meant they had to be in the
building still. Alone. They could be dead, and not necessarily because of
vampires. This was bad, very bad.</p>
<p>She ran into the school, careful to stay out of sight of the cops, who were
clearing out. They probably wanted to do the protocol stuff when it was a little
lighter out, and she didn't blame them. Entering the lounge, she frowned when
she saw a chalk outline on the floor. She said a silent apology to whomever the
victim had been, and continued her search.</p>
<p>See, this was the bizarre thing she was discovering. Cordelia was a person
with a lot more going on than she showed people, and the cheerleader could be
sensitive as well as polite. As was evidenced by their cafeteria discussion the
other day. It was on her mind, too. Good. She wasn't the lone wolf then.</p>
<p>Her dislike of Cordelia had come about because everyone else appeared to
dislike her, but she really hadn't shown any outward hatred towards her. Until
that night obviously, and they both knew how that had ended. Cordelia had a
strength and a resilience that Buffy didn't think she was even aware of. Buffy
wanted to know her, to find out what else was hidden.</p>
<p>But what should they do? They'd talk for awhile, but eventually, *it* would
have to be dealt with. When that time came, would they act on...whatever it was
that they had developed? She had definite leanings as to where it would go, and
Buffy couldn't visualize that ever happening. Even if feelings were to mesh,
Cordelia wouldn't go for it. This was high school. There were invisible
boundaries and unstated rules that were supposed to be followed.</p>
<p>If they weren't, which they would be, Buffy suspected that initially there
would be the struggle of dealing with a new lifestyle choice on a family and
friendship level, and then there would be the wider circle of peers forcing them
to cope with ridicule. It wasn't like she had a problem with that. If happiness
was going to be the result, it didn't matter. But that was one of many paths,
and of all of them, the most blocked off.</p>
<p>And Angel. She definitely had to pick a stance where he was concerned. He did
have a talent for making her swoon, and she was grateful for his presence in her
life, him watching her back and all that. Though usually the swooning came to an
end, and she fell flat on her face. The hardest thing was that she knew he loved
her. There was a time when she could break hearts with ease if the need arose,
but that time was long gone.</p>
<p>Cordelia didn't make her swoon or gush, no. Cordelia...well, she wasn't sure
exactly what she did to her. And maybe not knowing was a good thing. However,
the bottom line was that she had two, potential - dare she think it? - Love
interests, and she had to pick a course of action soon, and stick with it. Heavy
thoughts didn't change the fact that Cordelia eating her fries was adorable,
though.</p>

<p>The 'C' word and adorable in the same sentence. Who knew?</p>
<p>Buffy was about to call out names when she heard voices down the hall. The
closer she got, the clearer they were, and she could tell that the voices were
coming from inside the janitor's closet.</p>
<p>"And if you get me out of this, I swear I'll never be mean to anyone
ever again. Unless they *really* deserve it. Or if it's that time of the month,
in which case I don't think you or anyone else can hold me responsible -"
Cordelia was saying.</p>
<p>"Ask for some aspirin." Willow interrupted her in what sounded like
a tired voice.</p>
<p>"And can you please send some asp..." There was a pause.
"Hey!"</p>

<p>Buffy snickered and then opened the door, causing both girls to scream.</p>
<p>"Geez, Buffy! Knock much?" Cordelia was close to hyperventilating.</p>
<p>"Is it safe?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"As houses. Vamps cleared out, but Spike's still alive." The slayer
told them, trying hard not to get too angry over that.</p>
<p>"You're not hurt or bleeding internally then?" Cordelia wondered.</p>

<p>"Don't think so. Why, were you concerned about me?" Buffy grinned
slightly.</p>
<p>"As if. It's just now I won't feel bad about screaming at you for not
coming to get us sooner! Do you have any idea what I went through?"</p>
<p>The redhead practically groaned. "I have to get out of here. I can't
take it anymore. I try, I really do, but every single time it's..." Willow
continued babbling to herself as she quickly made her way to the outside world.</p>
<p>Buffy and Cordelia watched her go.</p>
<p>"Nice dress." Buffy complimented.</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>She'd been meaning to say that the whole night. They started leaving.</p>
<p>"Why do you always do that?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"Do what?"</p>
<p>"Try to constantly annoy Xander and Willow."</p>
<p>"I don't try; it comes naturally." Cordelia smiled enigmatically.
"If they didn't make it so easy..."</p>

<p>"And as the Ruler of Loserdom, I guess that's my fault, right?"</p>
<p>"Nah, they were easy long before you came. And anyway, you're not the
Ruler of Loserdom; you're the Rejected Step-Sister of the Princess of Loserdom.
Which is, believe it or not, that girl that's on Ritalin," She made quote
marks with her fingers, "in the back of History class."</p>
<p>She got a laugh.</p>
<p>"I stand corrected, Your Majesty." Buffy mock-bowed, and she was
smacked for it. "All I'm doing is showing the Queen some respect."</p>
<p>"Well stop. I don't deserve it. Really." Cordelia said quietly.
When they got to the doors, the conversation resumed. "We're not enemies.
You know that, right?"</p>

<p>"This is coming from...?"</p>
<p>"Yesterday. That thing about keeping enemies closer than friends. I only
said it cause I hoped it would explain why I was there, and get them quiet. One
out of two wasn't bad."</p>
<p>"I know." The brunette had left her with a question that needed to
be asked. "Why...did you sit down?"</p>
<p>Cordelia stretched her arms behind her back with a sigh. "Honestly? I
don't have the energy right now. And even if I did come up with an answer
-"</p>
<p>"Hey, don't worry about it; it was a long night." Buffy assured
her. "If it's any consolation, I think we're in the same boat here."

They shared a smile. "You need a ride? My mom could drop you off."</p>
<p>"Got my car. But I appreciate the offer." She smiled again.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm glad you're not dead."</p>
<p>"Me too." Buffy eyed her. "And that you're still living,
obviously."</p>
<p>"How sweet." The slayer said sarcastically.</p>

<p>"You know me." She gave a quick wave. "See ya tomorrow, Buffy."</p>
<p>Buffy knew bits and pieces, but not the big picture that was Cordelia Chase.
That intrigued her day in and day out.</p>
<p>"Yeah, good night, Cordy." They split up, going off in different
directions, and Buffy called over her shoulder. "Call me."</p>
<p>Had to start somewhere.</p>
