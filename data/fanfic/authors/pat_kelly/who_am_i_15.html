<!-- Who Am I? \ Morning Tensions (Or - I Think It Has To Be Exactly Like This) -->

<p>"Spike." Buffy had
brought him up to speed on his prodigy. The thing of it was,
 he really didn't care. Spike was the least of everyone's problems. "I
really don't have time
 for this."</p>
<p>"Oh you don't? I was
just out for a drink, saw you, figured I'd pay you a visit. We
 hardly ever talk anymore. I wait and wait…nothing. So you'll make
time." Angel stood
 calmly, his hands cupped in front of him, as Spike walked around the
mansion, looking at
 the walls.</p>
<p>"How far do you think
you'll get?"</p>
<p>"I'll get far enough.
Might even take a slayer or two with me. But as long as we're
 playing question and answer, Mr. Detective, how far do you think
you'll get? You know,
 seeing as you're still Buffy-whipped."</p>
<p>"You wanna go there,
fine with me. Because we both know if Dru walked in right
 now, you'd do anything she asked. Isn't that right?"
 Spike shook his head, and forced a laugh. "Know what I remember about
this
 place?"</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>"Taking a crowbar to
the back of your bloody head!" Spike ran at him, his
 vampire visage surfacing along the way.</p>
<p>Angel sidestepped a
little, and caught Spike's arm. He flipped him onto his back.</p>
<p>"That's why you fail,
Spike. Never brave enough to set out on your own. Always
 gotta take orders from somebody."</p>
<p>Spike got back to his
feet in one quick motion, and kicked his leg up, connecting
 with Angel's face. His sire was somewhat taken by surprise. "They say
it's never too late
 to turn your un-life around. How do you know I'm not just building my
strength up and
 then leaving this sodding town?" He punched Angel successively in the
face, and swept
 his legs.</p>
<p>Angel shot up as fast
as he had fallen, grabbed Spike by the shirt, and shoved him
 against the fireplace. Two sets of gleaming yellow eyes stared at one
another now, fangs
 and all. He brought his knee up into Spike's gut, and let him slide
down to the floor.</p>
<p>"I don't. And I don't
care."</p>
<p>"That was always the
problem. You were never there for me when I was growing
 up."</p>
<p>"Let's make up for
lost time then."</p>
<p>As Angel reached down
to grab him, Spike moved out of the way, his
 supernatural speed allowing him to be behind Angel before he knew it.
Spike wrapped
 his arm around Angel's throat.</p>
<p>"Sure thing,
Daddy."

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>When they woke up,
well there was no clock so they weren't really sure, but they
 knew it was early. Faith was not only surprised that she was still
lying next to Buffy, but
 that she also didn't want to move. It was certainly one of the more
unique experiences
 she'd had, in more ways then one. She was trying to place what she was
feeling. God, was
 it happiness? The thing that stuck out the most was the most
shocking.</p>
<p>It had *meant*
something. It had meant…a lot.</p>
<p>When she felt Buffy's
arm tighten around her, she found herself helping by
 moving in closer to her. Her memories apparently hadn't scared Buffy
off, and she was
 glad for that. Seeing Buffy's was a shock. She wasn't going to mention
what she saw,
 because there was no need to. She understood, and she knew Buffy did
too. The only
 thing she wanted to know was why it happened.</p>
<p>"Morning." Buffy said
in the middle of a yawn.</p>
<p>"Is it?"</p>
<p>"Who knows? Just
seemed like the right thing to say." She was quiet for a few
 seconds. "So…um…was I okay…last night?"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"It was…my first…time
with..." Buffy said slowly.</p>
<p>Faith was trying to
find a word. "Coulda fooled me. It was amazing, B."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Swear. How'd I rate
on the Summers Intimacy Meter?"</p>
<p>"You really wanna
know?" Buffy grinned and kissed Faith. "On a scale from
 'You're done already?' to 'I can see stars'…well, I think I saw a
couple different solar
 systems."</p>
<p>"Way to boost a girl's
ego."</p>
<p>"Only yours. But that
was…"</p>
<p>"Something else. Those
flashes…"</p>
<p>Buffy was quiet for a
moment, thinking. "The bond…"</p>
<p>Faith sat up slightly,
and Buffy moved back with her. "What bond?"</p>
<p>"I asked Giles awhile
ago about some stuff. He said that slayers all have the
 potential to form a bond. I think we did."</p>
<p>"So we're what?
Connected?"</p>
<p>"I think so. In a way.
I mean, how could we see what we saw if we weren't?"</p>
<p>Faith grabbed Buffy's
hand under the sheets. "Cool."</p>
<p>Buffy smiled. "Yeah,
it is."</p>
<p>"I just hope that
memory thing doesn't happen every time. Was pretty intense."
 She felt Buffy nod against her shoulder.</p>
<p>"We'll just have to
see."</p>
<p>"Are you -?"</p>
<p>Buffy giggled. "No!
I'm still recovering."</p>
<p>There was a knock at
the door, then, and both girls took a deep breath. One of
 them had to get up. Faith eventually got up slowly, wrapping a sheet
around her. She
 grinned at Buffy before walking to the door, and leaned down to give
her a rather
 passionate kiss.</p>
<p>"Keep recovering. I
got it."</p>
<p>Buffy, despite the
goofy smile she had, rolled her eyes playfully. Her partner
 certainly had cocky confidence in herself and her abilities. And Buffy
could testify first-
 hand that the confidence was well founded. She loved it.</p>
<p>She heard Faith open
the door. "Who is it?"</p>
<p>Faith had paled.
"Uh…hey, Mrs. S."

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Giles came downstairs
with a blanket and covered the two young wiccans who
 were curled up together, asleep, against the side the left side of his
couch. Wesley was
 huddled over Willow's laptop, looking at the coding for the
virus.</p>
<p>"I think they
overworked themselves." Giles commented.</p>
<p>"Yes, but I believe it
was worth it. She certainly has an talent for this kind of
 thing." Wesley said.</p>
<p>"And may I ask…how do
you understand any of that?" Giles asked, pulling up a
 chair.</p>
<p>"Willow has almost
completed it, I'm just trying to fill in the holes. It's actually
 really quite simple," Wesley looked down at an open notebook beside
the computer,
 "when it's already prewritten, of course."</p>
<p>Giles smirked. "Of
course."</p>
<p>"What time is
it?"</p>
<p>Giles glanced at his
clock. "Ah…6:15."</p>
<p>"Thankfully, working
for Angel has permanently adjusted my internal clock."</p>
<p>"Speaking of, how's
Cordelia?"</p>
<p>"Cordelia." Wesley
smiled. "But…changed. She's matured."</p>
<p>"I'm trying to picture
it…"</p>
<p>"Believe me, I'm proud
to call her my colleague, and my friend."</p>
<p>"So she's back in LA
right now?"</p>
<p>"No…um…she talked
Angel into some vacation time while we were here. She
 said she was going to one of the islands."</p>
<p>"He's a lax employer,
then?"</p>
<p>"He's forceful when
necessary."

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Angel brought his arms
forward, then slammed them back, elbowing Spike in the
 chest. The blonde vampire staggered backwards, losing his grip. Angel
grabbed him by
 the back of his jacket, and tossed him across the room and into a
wall. Spike fell, and
 Angel was standing overtop of him within seconds. They were a couple
feet away from
 the entrance to the garden.</p>
<p>"Sun's coming
up."</p>
<p>Spike glanced over and
saw chains lying in a pile a few feet away from him.
 "How about that? It is."</p>
<p>He brought his arm up
and gave a pretty hard shot to Angel's groin. The older
 vampire fell to his knees, and Spike quickly and swiftly grabbed the
chains. He raised
 them up, and swung them down, connecting with Angel's head. Again. And
again.</p>
<p>His forehead was
bleeding, and Spike kept at it. Finally, Angel caught the chain,
 stood up with it in hand, and fighting against Spike, wrapped it
around his neck,
 squeezing as hard as he could.</p>
<p>Angel led them both
out into the garden, and let Spike drop to the ground. He
 kicked him in the ribs repeatedly, his demon side enjoying it
immensely. He really hated
 Spike.</p>
<p>"Come on, finish the
job."</p>
<p>"If that's what you
want."</p>
<p>A stake shot out from
a mechanism on Angel's wrist, and grabbed it, preferring to
 do it the old fashioned way. He lowered himself down, putting his knee
on Spike's legs,
 so he couldn't get up, and raised the stake.

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Xander was awoken
rather early, too early for his liking, but his Initiative pager,
 which asked him to report to base immediately.</p>
<p>"Just remember why
you're doing this," He reminded himself, "to help your
 friends. To make up for your mistakes. Of which there were
many."</p>
<p>He got to the complex
around five minutes later and changed into uniform to find
 only Graham awaiting him in the main room. The man looked a little
ragged around the
 eyes. And a little stressed out. Xander guessed he hadn't slept
much.</p>
<p>"Where are the
others?" Xander asked, looking around.</p>
<p>"I needed to just talk
to you."</p>
<p>"About?"</p>
<p>"Well, I've made a
mistake. This whole operation has made a mistake, and I don't
 deny that."</p>
<p>"Adam and
Riley."</p>
<p>Graham nodded. "But
we've spent so much time looking for Adam, and now that
 we have, we're not sure how to take him out. Riley too. That's the
curse of the military I
 guess. Shortsightedness."</p>
<p>"You're saying that
the scientist guys haven't been working on it?"</p>
<p>"They don't want to
destroy them, they just want to capture and fix them. I…I'm a
 soldier. The only reason I'm in charge is because my two previous
commanders are dead.
 I ordered Riley's upgrade, because I didn't think he deserved to go
out like that. But I
 didn't know what I was asking for. I just want these 'things'
gone."</p>
<p>Xander thought Graham
was being a little too open, but he could hear the honesty
 in his voice. "So what do you think I can do?"</p>
<p>"We've been keeping
tabs on your friends, and we know they have or are close to,
 creating a virus to kill our two escapees. I want you to get it from
them. Storming the
 cave would be useless without a way to disable them."</p>
<p>And there was the
catch. "You want me to steal it from them?"</p>
<p>"We want the same
thing they do."</p>
<p>"Then why not let them
handle it?"</p>
<p>"Because the soldiers
are military property, and we handle our own problems."</p>
<p>"How do I know you're
gonna destroy them and not just -"</p>
<p>"I'm giving you an
order, do you have a problem with that?"</p>
<p>"No. No sir."</p>
<p>"I'm authorizing any
means necessary. Arm yourself."</p>
<p>"Yes sir."</p>
<p>Xander walked off
feeling very worried. As he went out of view, the lead scientist
 came out of a side room and walked up to Graham.</p>
<p>"You pulled that off
nicely. I doubt you would have gotten his cooperation if you
 had told him we didn't plan to destroy them. Despite the threat to his
life if he refused."</p>
<p>"I've learned that
sometimes, to get the job done, lying is a necessary evil."
 Graham walked away, and paying no attention to the consequences of
what he was going
 to bring on himself, let a small smile creep onto his face. "Even when
risking what you've
 built your life around."

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Mom?" Buffy called a
bit too loudly from her spot in the bed.</p>
<p>The two, silent
females in the next room heard frantic fumbling and noises for
 about two minutes, until eventually, Buffy emerged from the bedroom,
fully dressed.
 Though it was obvious it had been a rushed job.</p>
<p>"You know I think I'll
just…" Faith trailed off. This was not making a good
 impression on the still stoic Joyce.</p>
<p>"Get dressed?" Buffy
offered quickly.
 "Right. Gotta look decent. It's always my first priority. Uh…usually."
Faith was
 grasping at really thin straws, and she knew it. Shutting her mouth
before she made
 things worse, she slowly backed up into the bedroom.</p>
<p>"So…mom," Buffy began,
clapping her hands together, "do you wanna sit
 down?" Joyce shook her head. "Okay, no sitting. Say, what time is
it?"</p>
<p>"Past six." Joyce
finally spoke.</p>
<p>"In the morning?
You're here kinda early."</p>
<p>"I've been thinking
about it all night. I figured the earlier we talked the better. I
 was obviously wrong."</p>
<p>"Don't suppose it was
going to be a good talk."</p>
<p>"It was looking that
way."</p>
<p>"Looking?" Buffy took
a breath. "I know…I mean what really bad timing, huh?
 Wow… uh…but we could still…talk."</p>
<p>"I don't think that's
a very good idea right now."</p>
<p>"But I'm all for
talking. Faith too. Right?"</p>
<p>"Totally." Faith
called out.</p>
<p>"So how do you wanna
handle this, mom? Cause one of us is avoiding. We could
 get it all out right now. Like a Band-Aid. Once and we'd be
done."</p>
<p>"I…I have to go."
Joyce said, and then walked out.</p>
<p>"Guess that's not an
option." Buffy said rubbing her hands over her face.</p>
<p>Faith emerged from the
bedroom. "So what's the deal?"</p>
<p>"Who knows?" Buffy
responded, frustration evident in her voice.

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Spike reached out his
arm, feeling along the ground for anything to keep him
 undead for another day. He was coming up empty, and wished he were
somewhere else.
 He went toe to toe with his sire, but that wasn't good enough. It
needed to either be a
 mutual draw, or he had to win.</p>
<p>He felt like he was
dislocating his shoulder, but he eventually felt something.
 Something sharp. Not caring what it was, he grabbed it with his
fingers, and swiped
 Angel's face. A second later, all he knew was that the weight was off,
and he was able to
 move again. He saw that he had a shard of glass. Looking over at his
fallen enemy, he
 grinned and through it to the ground.</p>
<p>Angel hissed; the side
of his face was cut. He watched Spike take off as his face
 shifted back to human form. He got up slowly, and walked back into the
mansion before
 he started getting really bad sunburn.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of
trying to stick it out, his body registered the pain, even
 though the cuts would probably be gone within the next half-hour. It
was a good thing he
 had brought his personal first aid kit in from the car, though he just
needed to clean the
 blood away. Now, if he could find it…</p>
<p>Then he heard
footsteps even the mansion. It wasn't Spike, because he could smell
 the warm blood. He looked around, and his eyes finally settled on
Joyce.</p>
<p>"It is you." Joyce
stated.</p>
<p>"I'm here to help
Buffy and Faith fight," He caught the faraway look on her face,
 "but I'll be gone as soon as it's safe."</p>
<p>"I didn't mean…oh I
don't know what I mean anymore."</p>
<p>"What are you doing
out this way?"</p>
<p>"I was driving. And
thinking. I ended up here and saw Spike running. I figured
 the only reason he would be here is because of you, and it looks like
you two were
 fighting." Joyce said in a disparaging tone.</p>
<p>For a second, Angel
almost felt guilty about fighting for his life. "It's goes back a
 long time with us. You didn't happen to see a first aid kit around
here, did you?"</p>
<p>Joyce looked. "Yes.
It's sitting on this trunk against the wall."</p>
<p>"Would you mind
-?"</p>
<p>"Not at all." She went
to grab it.</p>
<p>"Can I ask what's
bothering you?"</p>
<p>"Well…Buffy always
said you were a good listener." She handed him the kit, and
 he nodded gratefully. "Do you know about -?"</p>
<p>"Faith?"</p>
<p>"You're good at that.
So," Joyce cleared her throat, "I'm trying to decide what's
 more dangerous for her. Dating a vampire, no offense," Angel simply
waited, "or…"</p>
<p>"Dating Faith? Or
dating a girl?"</p>
<p>"Should it make a
difference?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely." Angel
said, taking a rag and cleaning the blood off his face. "Faith
 is not the same person she was. She was able to stop herself before it
got any worse. I
 only wish I could have done that."</p>
<p>"She stopped
because…"</p>
<p>"Because she found
love, and was able to finally realize it."</p>
<p>"With my
daughter."</p>
<p>"Is that so hard to
believe? The fact that she told you means she wants you to still
 be involved in her life. You're luckier then most."</p>
<p>"Am I? Because it
seems like just when I'm about to come to terms with one
 thing, something else comes up."</p>
<p>"That's her life on a
daily basis. She understands it's complicated for you, but for
 her, this is nothing compared to some of the other things she has to
deal with. A lot of
 people connect for a lot of different reasons, Joyce."</p>
<p>"Like the two of you."
He nodded. "You seem very accepting."</p>
<p>"I'm two-hundred and
forty six. I've been denied happiness for most of those
 years. But just because I'm not allowed to have it doesn't mean I
don't want anybody else
 to. We would've never been truly happy. And Buffy and Faith deserve to
have that
 chance. It may last, it may not, but it's not my place to stand in the
way."</p>
<p>"Do you think they
will?"</p>
<p>"As long as they want
it, and there are no curses involved." Angel said in a rather
 deadpan manner.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Angel. I
think I'll try...and talk to them again." Joyce said, beginning
 to leave.</p>
<p>"Your welcome. Would
you tell her that Adam is in a cave deep in Breaker's
 Woods? It's important. She'll know what it means."</p>
<p>"Of course."

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Tara and Willow awoke
almost simultaneously, to find themselves in a "couch
 and blanket" position. Not an uncomfortable one, but they knew they
hadn't been like this
 the night before.</p>
<p>
"Hmm…Giles'…couch…blanket…" Willow trailed off as she saw Wesley and
 Giles moving about the house. Tara arched her neck too. "And Giles and
Wesley…able
 to see us…how…"</p>
<p>They both threw the
blanket off, and sat up nervously and quickly. They had
 nothing to hide, sure, but it was still a really…intimate position.
Wesley saw them awake,
 and walked over.</p>
<p>"Good morning,
girls."</p>
<p>
"Wesley...hey…hi…morning…" They stuttered.</p>
<p>"I believe Giles is
making eggs. Would you be interested?"</p>
<p>"Do you like eggs,
Tara?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah…love
eggs…good…"</p>
<p>"Hey! Me too! We're
egg lovers. Gotta love eggs. Yum."</p>
<p>"So that's a yes,
then?" Wesley asked.</p>
<p>"You betcha."</p>
<p>Wesley started to go
tell Giles, and then stopped. "Oh…I…completed the code
 you left out last night, though I'm not positive it's all
correct…"</p>
<p>"Oh great! We'll check
it."</p>
<p>As the girls got up to
walk over to the laptop, they didn't notice Xander peaking in
 the window. It took them about two minutes to scan Wesley's work, well
it took Willow
 that long, and it all appeared to be correct. Pulling a floppy disk
out of her case, she
 inserted it into her drive, and saved the virus to it.</p>
<p>"It's all done. Nice
goin', Wesley." Willow congratulated him.</p>
<p>He blushed in the
kitchen.</p>
<p>"So now what?" Tara
asked.</p>
<p>"Well…we can't exactly
test this, so the next move is to get it into Adam and hope
 it works. If it does, it'll weaken his structure, first the hardware,
which should send,
 mixed signals to his brain, and he won't be so unkillable anymore.
Plus he won't be very
 coordinated. Same for Riley. Hopefully."</p>
<p>"Cool." Tara gave her
a quick kiss.</p>
<p>Xander moved away from
the window.

<p align=center>***</p>


<p>"Feel like going out?"
Buffy asked. Faith shrugged. "Me either. Shadow
 puppets?"</p>
<p>"I don't think there's
enough light."</p>
<p>"Oh. Yeah."</p>
<p>Buffy and Faith had
been staring at the walls for about an hour, so they were
 pretty excited when there was a knock at the door. What had happened
with Joyce had
 been bothering them a lot, and they couldn't really find the energy to
do much of
 anything. They both went to the door, and Buffy opened it. Buffy
smiled when she saw
 who it was, and Faith smiled too. Although a bit more nervously.</p>
<p>"Mom. Hi."</p>
<p>"Can we try this
again?"</p>
<p>"Sure…come in."</p>
<p>When Joyce entered,
Faith shut the door, and they went back to the couch.

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Spike entered the
cave, a smile on his face. Adam stood looking at Riley, who had
 his eyes closed.</p>
<p>"I think I'm ready, I
got one up on my maker, and I gotta tell ya, I'm feeling really
 good about myself. Think it's time to launch an offensive. Take care
of the slayers once
 and for all…"</p>
<p>Riley's eyes snapped
open, and a disk ejected from his built in drive.</p>
<p>"He's finished." Adam
spoke.</p>
<p>"Wonderful." Spike
commented dryly.</p>
<p>"You are free,
brother."</p>
<p>Riley blinked, trying
to get his bearings. He looked at his hands, as his memories
 came back. The emotions were kicking in at full blast. A drawback to
being an updated
 version that just had its memory unlocked.</p>
<p>"Oh God…Buffy…"</p>
