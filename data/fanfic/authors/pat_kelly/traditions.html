<!-- Traditions \ Story -->

<p>"Where's my favorite slayer duo?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>Cordelia was sitting beside him, and Willow was across from the two of them, watching Oz
play on stage. They were occupying couches at the Bronze, awaiting the arrival of Buffy
and Faith. It had been almost three weeks since Christmas, and besides a demon disguised
as two kids, that got their parents to try and burn them at the stake, it had been fairly
quiet.</p>

<p>Willow's mother, along with Buffy's, had tried to kill her, Amy, Buffy, and Faith by
carrying out a "witch trial"-esque punishment. That wasn't the way Willow envisioned her
mother getting involved in her life, and she would have been traumatized by it, if she
hadn't known it was a demon that had caused it all.</p>

<p>There were negative and positive outcomes to the whole experience. The bad thing was, Amy
had turned herself into a rat. Her fellow witch had escaped, but Willow couldn't make her
human again. The good thing was, she and Cordelia were on speaking terms again. At least,
she was pretty sure that was a good thing.</p>

<p>The brunette had used the fire hose in City Hall to put out the fire. After the flames
were doused, she had sprayed Willow with water for an excessively, long amount of time,
and had enjoyed it immensely. Cordelia had gotten back at her in a completely immature and
childish way, but it had apparently been enough. And that was fine by Willow, because she
really didn't want the cheerleader glaring at her, hating her, for the rest of senior
year.</p>

<p>She looked at Xander now, a smirk on her face.</p>

<p>"They're the only slayers you know. Meaning they're the only duo you know, too."</p>

<p>"And that's why they're my favorite. Duh." He replied with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>Cordelia sighed. "They're patrolling. Maybe it's just taking a little longer tonight."</p>

<p>"But it shouldn't really take long…should it?" Willow asked, not liking the feeling
bubbling up in the pit of her stomach. "There's two of them. What if something's wrong?"</p>

<p>"See what you started? Now she's all panicky." Cordelia admonished her boyfriend.</p>

<p>"I'm sure they're fine, Will. You know how they are. They probably slayed every
pointy-toothed bad guy that was stupid enough to try and take them on, and now they're
probably battling tongues somewhere." He explained; trying not to drool at the image he
just created.</p>

<p>"Battling tongues? I've never heard of demon tong -" The redhead flushed. "Right. You're
right. About the 'being fine' part, I mean."</p>

<p>Xander and Cordelia looked around the club anyway, fighting that same uneasy feeling in
the pit of their stomachs that Willow had been.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Faith!" Buffy screamed, as she got shoved up against a wall.</p>

<p>The blonde wished they were making out somewhere, she really did, but the fact of the
matter was, they were currently in trouble. And she didn't know why. One minute, they were
taking a shortcut through the alley behind the Bronze after a successful, routine slaying
to meet up with their friends, and the next, they saw the bouncer in the alley being
snacked upon.</p>

<p>So, of course, they went to stop the two vampires.</p>

<p>Neither of them was tired or fatigued, and they assumed it was going to be a quick
dusting. It had started out that way, then all of the sudden; they had both begun to feel
dizzy and...weak. The vampires got the upper hand once they realized there was something
wrong with the slayers, and had it still.</p>

<p>After her vampire got tired of slamming her head against the wall, he threw her up onto a
dumpster. Buffy saw half of a wooden table leg sticking out of the dumpster, and used all
her energy to break it off and make a stake. When the vampire picked her up and held her
in mid air, he smiled at having Buffy Summers in his grasp. She thrust her stake-holding
arm however, and as his ashes fell to the pavement, so did she.</p>

<p>Faith had been knocked hard to the ground, and was wrestling with one of them. They were
never this strong, and she knew he wasn't. He couldn't be. Something else was going on.
There was a broken piece of glass on the ground, and when they rolled near it, she grabbed
it and shoved it into the vampire's back. He growled in pain, and she finally was able to
get on top of him.</p>

<p>Her partner tossed her the table leg; she punched him hard in the face, and then ended his
existence. Now that the danger was gone, she came out of slayer mode, and felt an intense
pain. She looked down, and realized that it was her hand. The one she had just punched the
vampire with. It was bleeding, and it felt...broken.</p>

<p>"Goddamn it!" She hissed.</p>

<p>Buffy made her way over, and crouched next to Faith. She drew in a breath when she saw the
hand. That wasn't right.</p>

<p>"Let me look at it."</p>

<p>"It hurts...a whole mother fu - a lot." Faith bit back the stream of expletives that
wanted to come out of her mouth.</p>

<p>She let Buffy inspect it.</p>

<p>"It's just sprained. That's good." Faith scowled, and Buffy cringed. "Sorry...just meant
that -"</p>

<p>The dazed and grateful bouncer made his way over to the two girls that had saved his life.</p>

<p>"She okay?"</p>

<p>Buffy looked up at him. "She will be. You got any towels? And some ice?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. Inside."</p>

<p>"Faith can you -?"</p>

<p>"I can walk." Faith answered before the question was finished.</p>

<p>The bouncer led them through the back door. The people inside saw them enter, and looked
extremely annoyed.</p>

<p>"Hey! How come they don't have to come in the front and pay the cover?" One girl asked, as
she nodded towards the entrance and the temporary bouncer who was filling in at the
moment. "You're not doing some sort of bum outreach thing, are you?"</p>

<p>Faith, holding her wrist, got in the girl's face, and glared. She was not in the mood for
a stupid girl who knew absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>"Shut the hell up you little, upper class -"</p>

<p>Buffy quickly pulled Faith back.</p>

<p>"Going now. See us? We're going. Away."</p>

<p>Their friends had been looking on, and made their way back. Buffy acknowledged them with a
weary smile, but Faith, angry and in pain, did nothing. They followed the slayers as they
were led out of the main club area to a storage room, leaving a very appalled girl in a
frightened shock.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Show him." Buffy said to Faith, the next day in the library.</p>

<p>Giles looked at Faith's bandaged hand when she held it out, and then looked at the
slayer's eyes, waiting for further information.</p>

<p>"Vampire. I punched him, something I like to think I'm pretty good at, and I busted my
hand up pretty bad. Wicked painful still."</p>

<p>"Hmm..." Giles said. "Is it healing?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. I should be five by five when -"</p>

<p>"But they were just normal vampires, Giles." Buffy interrupted. "And they were
really...difficult to kill. It felt like somebody took my strength away." She looked to
Faith for confirmation, and she got a nod. "A punch almost broke her hand. Why would that
happen?"</p>

<p>Giles removed his glasses. "I...haven't got the slightest idea." He rubbed the glasses on
his shirt, cleaning them. "But I'll look into it. I wouldn't worry."</p>

<p>"If you...say so." She had hoped for a little more, concern.</p>

<p>"On a happier note," He said, rapidly changing the subject, "have you made plans for your
birthday?"</p>

<p>"That's a happier note?" She asked sarcastically.</p>

<p>Faith put her arm around Buffy's neck.</p>

<p>"You sure can be an old lady sometimes, B. You're turning eighteen. Adulthood. Sure, you
can't drink yet, legally, but now you can get arrested for having sex with minors."</p>

<p>"As bright sides go, that's kind of a stretch, Faith. A big stretch."</p>

<p>"Cheer up. Giles here is gonna figure our little problem out, and your dad's comin' to
take you to that ice show."</p>

<p>"Oh, your father is visiting?" Giles asked. "You must be looking forward to that."</p>

<p>"Yeah." Buffy smiled. "It should be fun."</p>

<p>"Atta girl." Faith said, turning Buffy toward the library doors. "He needs quiet to do his
thing, so we're going." They started walking. "Later." She called to Giles.</p>

<p>"You're in a good mood considering that last night, you were in major pain, and that girl
was -" Buffy started.</p>

<p>"Last night was last night. It's forgotten."</p>

<p>"But -"</p>

<p>"It's forgotten." She repeated, trying not to remember that girl.</p>

<p>Oh, she had *so* been asking for a reality check. But Faith wasn't going to go there,
because the girl was a moron, and really not worth thinking about. Even though she thought
she was 'Miss High Society'…</p>

<p>'You're better than her. You know that.'</p>

<p>"So...what were we not talking about again?" The blonde tried a smirk, knowing to drop it.</p>

<p>Giles watched them go, and then went into his office to grab his coat. He had to pay a
visit to someone.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>About a half an hour later, Giles was sitting on a couch, talking with the head of the
Council, Quentin Travers. They were in an old boardinghouse. Quentin's two assistants were
"customizing" the building, for the upcoming test. In the adjoining room, a locked crate
was upright, and shaking.</p>

<p>"We've always followed the traditions, Rupert, and Cruciamentum is the oldest and most
respected one we have." Quentin explained</p>

<p>"Respected? By whom?" Giles asked sharply.</p>

<p>"When a slayer turns eighteen -" Came the calm reply, which was cut off.</p>

<p>"You don't have to explain it to me. It's bad enough you're unleashing that," He looked to
the crate, "on Buffy, but why Faith? She doesn't meet the requirements yet. Two disabled
slayers -"</p>

<p>"I'm aware of that. But because of the unique situation, we felt some, modification, was
necessary." Quentin took a sip of tea. "Since it has been decided that Faith's stay on the
Hellmouth will be permanent, and that she and your slayer have become a team, we wish to
see how they function in that capacity. This situation is completely new to us, and we are
very interested in seeing the results."</p>

<p>"I can say, from personal, first-hand knowledge, that their slayings are extremely
well-coordinated, and executed."</p>

<p>"Don't get me wrong, I see the confidence you have in them from your reports, and I
believe they are very capable. However, you know as well as I do, slayers sometimes become
too reliant on their physical superiority. Along with that, they must be able to rely on
their cunning, creativity and each other, in battle. We have to make sure they have those
qualities."</p>

<p>"All the while endangering their lives in an ancient, barbaric contest."</p>

<p>"If they don't survive, then that would be unfortunate," Quentin said slowly, "but
hopefully, given everything I've heard about them, that will not be the case."</p>

<p>Giles sighed. "It's...what you've been asking me to do..."</p>

<p>"Is your duty. I realize it's hard, but it's also necessary." The out of touch Englishman
stood, and led Giles to the door. "This will all be over soon, one way or the other. The
way I see it, given their attachment to one another, they'll have an extra factor working
for them. The heart is a very motivating force, my friend."</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes it is." Giles agreed softly. "Is everything on schedule?"</p>

<p>"All the preparations are nearly complete. Administer the final injections tonight."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>It was lunchtime, and the whole gang was off-campus, sitting on the grass across the
street. Buffy still couldn't get her mind off the loss of her strength. She had tried to
help a girl earlier, who was being harassed by a guy, and he just tossed her away like a
rag doll. When she questioned Giles again, all she got was another calm reassurance. And
Faith didn't seem bothered by the situation, which Buffy found strange.</p>

<p>They were coupled up, sitting nice and close.</p>

<p>"Don't get any ideas about me feeding you grapes or nothin' like that, B." Faith told her.</p>

<p>"Funny. You're funny." Buffy said dryly. "Anyway, I'm not hungry."</p>

<p>"Me either." Five sets of eyes widened at her admission. "Yeah, I know I'm the one with a
bottomless pit for a stomach, okay?"</p>

<p>"Not to mention the one that's always in a twenty-four hour state of -"</p>

<p>"Buff, I beg you not to finish that sentence." Xander said, taking a bite of his Twinkie,
noticing the grins of the slayers, and almost choking. "Look, at least you get some days
off, right? Maybe it's the cosmic forces way of telling you to take a vacation."</p>

<p>"But what if it's permanent?" She countered.</p>

<p>"If it is...then isn't that what you both want?" Willow asked. "To be -"</p>

<p>"Normal?" Faith asked with a half-smile.</p>

<p>"Well...I wouldn't have put it…not that you two are...a-abnormal...then again...you kind
of are...b-but not in a bad way..." Oz started rubbing her shoulders, which stopped her
babble, and then Willow began studying her bologna and cheese sandwich. "Yeah."</p>

<p>"I don't know about Faith," Buffy said, "but I don't know if I can...go back. I wanted to
at one point, but now..." She just trailed off.</p>

<p>If she had looked up at the brunette slayer, Buffy would have seen a look of sadness flash
across her features.</p>

<p>"You like being world-saving Wonder Women." Cordelia said, boiling it down.</p>

<p>"Something like that, C." Faith said, her voice devoid of its usual playful tone. Or any
tone, for that matter.</p>

<p>There was quiet for what seemed like an awful long time, as everyone got sucked into the
slayers' unhappiness. They had never seen Faith look so down, either, and that threw them
a little. Her mood had definitely changed since the morning. Maybe Buffy had been wrong.
Maybe Faith was more bothered than she let on.</p>

<p>"You know what I just realized?" Oz said to the group. "Black clouds are very depressing."</p>

<p>"He's right. We have a birthday girl in our midst, and there should be celebrating going
on." Xander tried to lift the gloom. "And party planning."</p>

<p>"I think it's time to put a moratorium on parties in my honor, Xand. Things tend to go
badly."  The blonde sighed. "I just want to let this pass me by, and everything to be back
to..." She smirked. "Normal."</p>

<p>"Don't forget about your dad." Willow reminded her.</p>

<p>"I haven't, Will. He might just salvage the whole thing." Buffy said, smiling genuinely
for the first time.</p>

<p>"Hope he does, B." Faith added.</p>

<p>Even though they had lost their appetites, just to have something to do, they ate their
lunches, trying to distract themselves from the gloominess they were all in.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Hey mom."</p>

<p>"What's up, Mrs. S?"</p>

<p>Returning home after school let out, Buffy and Faith went into the kitchen and saw two
things. Joyce doing dishes, and a basket full of flowers on the counter. Buffy let out a
giddy "ooh", immediately going to them. Faith was amused at the sight until she saw the
expression on Joyce's face.</p>

<p>Buffy saw a card attached to the handle, and also a pair of tickets. Reading the front of
the envelope and seeing the words 'From Dad' on it, she frowned, and knew what its
contents said. She also knew that the tickets were to the ice show. She didn't even have
to look.</p>

<p>"His...quarterly projections are unraveling and he can't afford to take off right now.
He promises to make it up to you. It's all right there in the letter." Joyce explained.</p>

<p>"He's good at promising. Right, mom?" Buffy said sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Buffy..." Her daughter pushed the basket off the counter and into the trash, then walked
out of the kitchen in silence. Joyce sighed, and looked at Faith. "Why does he always do
this to her?"</p>

<p>"Cause he's an asshole?" Faith growled, not even realizing she had said it at first. "I'm
sorry."</p>

<p>"Don't apologize. Why do you think I divorced him?" The brunette couldn't stop the laugh
that came out. "Would you...talk to her?"</p>

<p>Faith smiled. "Just what I was about to do."</p>

<p>She started to leave the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Faith?"</p>

<p>"Yeah?" The slayer turned back around.</p>

<p>"I'm glad she's got you."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The younger Summers was lying on her bed, holding Mr. Gordo up in the air, just looking at
him blankly, when Faith came into the room. The other slayer gently shut the door, and sat
on the edge of the bed. She planned on talking to Buffy, but really, she had no idea what
to say. So, being a girl of action instead of words, she laid down on her side, beside the
blonde.</p>

<p>Buffy then rolled on her side to face Faith, and then the brunette draped her arm over
her, pulling her close.</p>

<p>"I should've expected him to pull out at the last minute." She spoke finally.</p>

<p>"It's his loss, Buffy."</p>

<p>"Maybe he just doesn't like me."</p>

<p>"Then he really is an ass...a really stupid person. If he actually *knew* you, like I
do..." Even talking about him was getting her pissed off. "None of it's your fault, and
I'm sure he loves you."</p>

<p>"I know that." Buffy sighed. "I do."</p>

<p>"And if you wanna go to that show still, I'd -"</p>

<p>"Sure. That'd be nice." She smiled. "But it's not missing the ice show that...it was just
the one thing he and I still did together. The one tradition we had left. I'm fine though.
Really."</p>

<p>"I wish I could make him not hurt you so much."</p>

<p>"This is helping."</p>

<p>Faith smiled. "I was gonna wait, but," She sat up and reached underneath the bed. A bright
colored, 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY' bag was in her almost completely healed hand, when she revealed
it again. Buffy shot up.</p>

<p>"You hid *my* present under *my* bed, and I didn't even know?"</p>

<p>"Guess that means you're pretty -"</p>

<p>"Dumb?"</p>

<p>"I was gonna clean it up and say 'dense', but hey, have it your way." Buffy hugged her and
rummaged through the bag. The first thing she pulled out was a game.
Resident Evil 2 for PlayStation, to be specific. She quirked an eyebrow at Faith. "It's
the newest thing. You should see the graphics."</p>

<p>"Let's see, I bought you that system for Christmas...which you mostly play..."</p>

<p>"I've caught you with a controller in your hand. Just think of this as...something we can
share."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I'm sure I'll...learn to love it." She smirked as she inspected the case.
"Zombies. Great. I can escape my life by playing a game that's based on it."</p>

<p>"Well...if we're weaklings for good, you won't have to deal with the bastards again. For
real." Faith said quietly.</p>

<p>"Yeah. You're right." She paused. "Are you *really* okay with this?"</p>

<p>"Hell no." The younger girl took a deep breath. "I figured it would blow over, so I didn't
let it bug me. But Giles hasn't found jack, and seeing you get swatted, kinda got me
freaked. When it happened to me, I could just...push it away. Then I actually saw...do you
get me?"</p>

<p>"Uh huh." She smiled weakly. "Gotta love denial. Besides the not being able to fight evil
part, I don't like who I was when I wasn't a slayer."</p>

<p>"Who were ya? Mabel Hickenson?"</p>

<p>"Cordelia on steroids."</p>

<p>"Ouch." Faith grinned.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go back to that."</p>

<p>"Why would you? You weren't like that when -"</p>

<p>"Not our summer. Just freshman year at Hemry."</p>

<p>"All freshman become morons. That's the way it always works in high school. Least that's
what I remember from my brief visit." She paused, reflecting. "But it's been three years
since then."</p>

<p>"But some people don't ever grow past the moronic stage."</p>

<p>"You have. You've got friends and your priorities straight. You're on track."</p>

<p>"Have I? Really? Maybe it's just the duty thing keeping me mature. I could, devolve, or
something."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't. Trust me." Buffy didn't challenge her. "And if the slayer thing doesn't
work out, you have something to fall back on. Finishing high school, college, you can get
yourself an education. Then comes a good job, and you're set. Me? I got zip."</p>

<p>"You could have that all too." Buffy told her softly.</p>

<p>"I..." She sighed. "Maybe that girl was right. If I'm not a slayer, then I'm just another,
no-name bum."</p>

<p>"You are *not* a bum. You're Faith, and I love you." She took her partner's hand, and
squeezed.</p>

<p>"What can I do?"</p>

<p>"You could enroll again, or -"</p>

<p>"And be a twenty-two year old high school graduate? And that's only if I don't fail and
have to repeat." She shook her head. "No thanks."</p>

<p>"Maybe you should think about it. You've got it in you, I know you do. I'd support you,
the gang would, and...you've survived worse things than high school."</p>

<p>Faith didn't know why she chuckled when Buffy said that, but she did. Probably because
comparing her life with what she feared about high school, when she thought about it, it
was true. She had survived far worse things. Being frightened of education seemed
pointless, but -</p>

<p>"Still got another present in there."</p>

<p>Buffy pointed her finger. "Okay, fine. But don't think that just cause you changed the
subject -"</p>

<p>"Just see what the damn thing is." The birthday girl reached in, and pulled out a stuffed
pig. It had a bow on its head. "Thought it was time Mr. Gordo settled down and left the
bachelor life behind."</p>

<p>"Awww! Faith!" She squealed, hugging her tightly, and giving her a long kiss. "She's
perfect!" She started talking to the new arrival. "You're perfect, Mrs. Gorda."</p>

<p>She brought the two pigs together.</p>

<p>"I think we should let them get acquainted, B. Newlyweds and all." She grinned. "And Giles
wants us to do that crystal thing again, remember?"</p>

<p>Buffy nodded. "Okay. But I have to say something first." She whispered to the female pig.
"Be good to him. He may not look it, but he's a lot more sensitive than other guy pigs.
Oh, and don't make too much noise."</p>

<p>The slayers got up, and walked out of the room.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Faith. For the gifts, and..."</p>

<p>"Happy Birthday, Buffy."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Tell me something, Giles." Buffy said as she and Faith sat down at the table in the
library. "How is looking at crystals gonna help us get our strength back? Cause that's
what I really care more about right now."</p>

<p>"This is a vibratory stone, and it's a necessary training exercise." He said, setting two
large, blue crystals in front of the slayers. "For both of you. Just because you're
experiencing...some physical setbacks, doesn't mean you shouldn't strengthen your other
abilities."</p>

<p>"Meaning?"</p>

<p>"Your mental ones."</p>

<p>"Are you insinuating somethin', G?" Faith asked playfully.</p>

<p>"No...we'll just continue this until...your strength problem sorts itself out." He
promised, then regretted the words as soon as he had said them.</p>

<p>"Sorts itself out?" The blonde repeated, feeling angry.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound -"</p>

<p>"It's okay." Faith said, interrupting him and looking at Buffy, silently telling her to
back off. "Let's get this done."</p>

<p>Buffy let out a long breath, and stared at her crystal along with the brunette.</p>

<p>"Okay, these are grounding crystals. I want you both to look for the tiny flaw in the
center of them."</p>

<p>In the next few seconds, both slayers had glazed over looks on their faces. They were
hypnotized. Giles made sure, and then proceeded to do the injections. He felt horrible,
disgusting, betraying their trust in him like this. But he had to do it. As Quentin had
said, it was his duty. And he had no doubt in his mind that they wouldn't be triumphant.
There was still the guilt, however.</p>

<p>After he finished, he brought them out of their trances. They didn't realize anything had
happened, and he told them they could take the rest of the night off. Shaking his head
once the girls had left; he sighed and figured he had better go tell Quentin that the
slayers were ready for the test.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Giles opened the door to the boarding house and looked cautiously inside. There was no
sound of any kind. Complete silence.</p>

<p>"Quentin?" He called out, stepping inside.</p>

<p>He received no answer. Shutting the door, he walked into the room where they had sat
earlier, finding nothing out of place.  He left the room, and walked down the hall a ways
to the staircase. Everything still seemed fine, but something was giving him chills.
Something was wrong.</p>

<p>"Quentin? Hob..." He tried again, but trailed off as he began saying one of the
assistants' names.</p>

<p>The reason for that was because when he touched the railing, it felt slick. Looking at his
palm, he found it covered in blood. Without thinking, he turned his attention to the crate
in the other room, broke one of the supports attached to the railing, and headed quickly
for the crate, afraid. He opened it, horrified when he found it empty, except for a
discarded prescription pill bottle. For combating crippling migraine headaches.</p>

<p>Shifting his gaze to the floor, he saw tracks of blood that led to the kitchen. Preparing
the stake he had crated, he followed them, opening the door and switching on the light.
What he saw made him want to vomit. There were body parts lying on the table, and
together, they had once made up the man known as Hobson. Giles dropped his weapon, and
quickly backed out, leaving the house feeling sick and panicked.</p>

<p>The test had been altered, and something needed to be done. He needed to contact Quentin,
because a course of action had to be decided upon. Quickly. Then he went rigid. Buffy and
Faith were walking the streets, and the creature that had been in the crate, knew all
about them.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy and Faith decided to head to the Bronze. It was now a little tradition for them,
after slaying or training, so they could burn off energy. But that wasn't their reason
this time. The night was still young, and if they went home, they'd just end up thinking.
That led to deeper thinking, then to...bad thoughts. In the club, the music was so loud,
that the noise would be all their brains could handle. Then they'd get headaches, and
could concentrate on the pain the pounding would cause.</p>

<p>"Oh, forgot to mention. Nice jacket, B."</p>

<p>She smirked at the petite slayer's "Red Riding Hood"-esque coat. She had seen Buffy get it
before they left the house, and had tried very hard to hold back a comment, but she just
couldn't. Her partner lightly punched her arm.</p>

<p>"I happen to like this jacket. It's bright." She defended.</p>

<p>"Just don't want the big bad wolf to come after you, that's all."</p>

<p>Buffy grinned. "Oz doesn't get hairy until next week."</p>

<p>"Speakin' of, you sure we shouldn't pick up Daphne, Shaggy, Scooby and Velma?" Faith
asked.</p>

<p>"And suck them further into our black hole of depression? I can't do that to them." Buffy
said. "Wait. If the rest of the gang is...who are we?"</p>

<p>"Easy. I'm Fred, and you're...Scrappy." She grinned.</p>

<p>"Hey! How come I'm the dog?"</p>

<p>"Cause I'm more butch than you. You're the cute, short, never give up, thickheaded type."</p>

<p>"Thickheaded? Short?" Buffy made a 'grrr' sound. "I may be just a girly, normal chick now,
but I can still whoop your ass in a cat fight." She made a grab for her girlfriend.</p>

<p>"Take it easy, Josie." Faith dodged the attack. "Did you happen to notice I called you
cute, too?"</p>

<p>"I seem to recall something like that being said." The blonde wrapped her arms around the
wary Bostonian's waist, and leaned in for a kiss. "K, you're forgiven."</p>

<p>Just before their lips connected, they heard the sound of humming. They looked around, not
seeing the source, and still it continued. Separating, annoyed and a little scared, they
were on guard.</p>

<p>"Hummers. Big turn off. I like guys who can remember the lyrics. Don't you, Faith?" Buffy
said.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Especially if they're on key."</p>

<p>As Buffy was peering down one end of the sidewalk, she felt someone tap her on the
shoulder. She turned around fast, and ended up in the grip of a smiling vampire.</p>

<p>"You know, I wish I could. Remember them. But my mind just isn't what it used to be." He
said.</p>

<p>Faith was looking at him now, frozen, as Buffy started to struggle.</p>

<p>"Let me go."</p>

<p>"Can't. You didn't say please." There was a psychotic, teasing tone to his voice.</p>

<p>"Please?" Her voice was shaking.</p>

<p>He appeared to think about it, and then shook his head.</p>

<p>"Didn't sound very sincere. You have to sell it. Wanna try again?"</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Let her go." Faith said, mustering up all her courage and strength.</p>

<p>"Now, now. You'll have to wait your turn just like everybody else." The vampire told her,
paying her no attention.</p>

<p>He began to squeeze Buffy's wrists harder, and she cried out from the pain. Faith got
behind him then, her fear being replaced with rage.</p>

<p>"I don't think you understood what I said. Let her, the hell, go."</p>

<p>She kicked the back of his right leg, causing his knee to buckle. That was all Buffy
needed to get her left arm loose. He quickly grabbed onto the back of her jacket though.</p>

<p>Completely scared out of her mind, she slipped her right arm out of her jacket, and then
her left. It was in his grasp, but she was free. Faith took her hand, and they started
running. Out of nowhere, another vampire appeared and cut off their escape. Taking a deep
breath, they barreled through him and kept going. When they looked behind them, he was
still following.</p>

<p>"Somebody help us, please!" Buffy yelled into the night.</p>

<p>Nobody answered the plea, and they eventually found themselves in alley behind some
houses, with a fence at the far end. Seeing the lackey not giving up, Faith wordlessly
bent down, and Buffy got onto her shoulders. Standing, her chest was already above the top
of the fence. She grabbed it, and swung herself over.
Faith got her feet in between the gaps, and tried to ascend, but wasn't making it. He was
getting closer. Buffy was still high up on the other side, shakily leaning over the top,
while trying hard not to fall. She reached her hands down, and Faith reached her hands up
to meet them.</p>

<p>"Reach, Faith! Come on!"</p>

<p>The brunette needed to just get a little higher. And the vampire was about seven seconds
away from lunging and grabbing her legs. She did, the slayers' hands connected, and Buffy
used all her strength to pull Faith up. She lost her footing just as Faith reached the
top, and fell down, bringing Faith over the side with her. They got up off the ground just
as their pursuer crashed into the fence.</p>

<p>Cars. There were cars going by that could get them far away. Around the time the second
car sped by, ignoring them, they recognized the next one. It was Giles'. He screeched to a
halt, and they hurriedly got in the back.</p>

<p>"Drive!" Faith screamed, and they took off.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Joyce was doing her bills at the dining room table when she heard a noise outside. She
went to investigate, opening the front door and stepping outside. Looking around, at
first, she saw nothing. Then she looked to the left side of the porch, and saw someone
lying there, covered in what looked like her daughter's red coat.</p>

<p>"Buffy?" She asked, fearing the younger girl might've been hurt.</p>

<p>The figure rolled over, revealing itself. It wasn't Buffy, it was a vampire. The one the
slayers had left behind earlier. The hummer. He grinned at Joyce, who backed away in
fright.</p>

<p>"Mother."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Back at the library, Faith and Buffy sunk into chairs, trying to ignore the aching and
bruising all over their bodies. They had come real close to dying, and were very much in a
state of shock. Giles went into the office once he was sure they were going to be okay,
and that they didn't have any major injuries.</p>

<p>"Giles, we can't wait for this 'whatever' to fix itself anymore." Buffy said once she
found her voice. Though she couldn't get it to stop shaking.</p>

<p>"I saw my life flash before my eyes." Faith said. "And the sad part is, I didn't see
much."</p>

<p>When he emerged, he had a case in his hand. He opened it and showed it to the girls. It
contained a syringe, some gauze, and a small bottle filled with a chemical of some kind.</p>

<p>"It's an organic compound...of muscle relaxants and adrenal suppressers. The effect is
temporary. You'll both be yourselves again in a few days." He explained, hardly able to
get the words out.</p>

<p>Once it sunk in for Faith, her eyes went wide, and she stood from her chair. After
studying the watcher's face for a few seconds, she went to sit on the steps, and stared at
her hands. He could plainly see her crushed expression. Buffy didn't move. She just picked
up the case, and kept turning it around in her hands.</p>

<p>"You?" The blonde asked hollowly.</p>

<p>"It's a test. It's given to the Slayer once she...well, if she reaches her eighteenth
birthday. Though it had to be adjusted to include you as well, Faith. Because of your
presence here, and your involvement with Buffy."</p>

<p>Giles swallowed, and decided to pace before continuing.</p>

<p>"A slayer...slayers in this case, are disabled and then entrapped with a vampire foe whom
they must defeat in order to pass the test. The vampire you two were to face... has
escaped."</p>

<p>He stopped.</p>

<p>"His name is Zachary Kralik. As a mortal, he murdered and tortured more than a dozen women
before he was committed to an asylum for the criminally insane. When a vamp -"</p>

<p>Buffy heard enough of his explanation. She threw the case at him, but it missed and hit
the wall behind him.</p>

<p>"You bastard." That caused Faith to look up. "All this time, you saw what it was doing to
us? All this time, and you didn't say a word?" Buffy said angrily, sobbing.</p>

<p>"I wanted to."</p>

<p>"Liar."</p>

<p>The brunette got up then, and walked over to him.</p>

<p>"Who the hell are you?" She said through clenched teeth. "I trusted you, liked you. It's
really hard for me to warm up to authority figures, and you and me seemed to be on our
way. No chance of that now, though. Cause you shot it to hell. And for what? Some goddamn
test that's set up just to see how long we can last before we die? I thought you were
different than the rest of 'em. That you cared. But you don't give a damn about us, do
you?"</p>

<p>"In matters of tradition and protocol, I must answer to the Council." Giles tried to
explain.</p>

<p>"Bullshit."</p>

<p>"My role in this...was very specific. I was to administer the injections and to direct you
to the old boardinghouse on Prescott Lane."</p>

<p>Buffy grabbed her head with both hands, and shook it.</p>

<p>"I can't...I can't hear this."</p>

<p>"Buffy, please." He reached out for her arm to try and comfort her, but she pulled it
away.</p>

<p>Faith grabbed his arm instead. "Touch her and I kill you."</p>

<p>"How could you do this to me?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"I am deeply sorry, Buffy, and you have to understand..." He sighed. "Because I've told
you this, the test is invalidated. You will be safe now, I promise you. Now whatever I
have to do to deal with Kralik...and to win back your trust..."</p>

<p>He looked at Faith as he said that too, but her stone-faced expression remained in place.</p>

<p>"You poisoned us!"</p>

<p>She stood now too, and faced toward the library doors, away from him. Faith came over and
stood behind her. Cordelia walked in then, seeing the tears on Buffy's face, and feeling
the tension in the air.</p>

<p>"Oh, God. Is the world ending? I have to research a paper on Bosnia for tomorrow, but if
the world's ending, I'm not gonna bother."</p>

<p>Buffy started to leave, and Faith followed silently.</p>

<p>"You can't walk home alone. It isn't safe." Giles told them.</p>

<p>"I don't know you." Came the destroyed blonde's response. Cordelia was going to comment,
but Faith's shaking head stopped her. "Cordelia, could you please drive us home?"</p>

<p>"Of course." The cheerleader said.</p>

<p>She and Buffy were moving out and away from the library, and Faith stayed behind for a
moment, turning around to look at Giles.</p>

<p>"Like a daughter to you, huh?" She spat, and then went to catch up.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Mother." Kralik said to a bound and gagged Joyce in the basement of the boarding house.</p>

<p>She was tied to a chair, and he was taking pictures of her with a Polaroid camera. One
after the other, on all sides, letting the developing photos fall to the floor. She looked
for him, following the sound of his voice. He was behind her, making his way to the front.</p>

<p>"May I call you Mother? My own mother was a person with no self-respect of her own, so she
tried to take mine."</p>

<p>Joyce turned away from him, but he still took pictures. Straining against the ropes around
her arms, did nothing. He had tied them tightly.</p>

<p>"Ten years old, she had the scissors. You wouldn't believe what she took with those. But
she's dead to me now. Mostly," Kralik chuckled, "because I killed and ate her, but also
because I know I won't be alone much longer."</p>

<p>He knelt down and got in his captive's face.</p>

<p>"I'll have your daughter. I won't kill her; I'll just make her like me. Different. Her,
and her tough, foolish partner. They'll go to sleep, and when they wake up, your face will
be the first thing they eat."</p>

<p>Joyce's eyes clearly showed the terror she felt. Kralik paused to think over his plans.</p>

<p>"I have a problem with mothers." He chuckled again. "I'm aware of that."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>When Cordelia was gone, they trudged numbly up the walk, and to the porch. It had been a
rough night for both of them, but it was harder for Buffy. Her world, everything she knew,
was falling down around her. Giles. Of all the people she ever thought would betray her,
he was at the bottom of the list. But it had happened. That's all she could think about.</p>

<p>Well, that, and what would be next.</p>

<p>She looked at Faith. They hadn't talked since the library, and weren't going to now. They
didn't know what there was to say, because words didn't help make what had just occurred,
any better. Especially when they both were still trying to get their bearings. But how
could words help? Also, they just didn't feel like it. It would waste the little energy
they had left.</p>

<p>Buffy reached the door first, and drew in a breath when she saw what was taped to the
door. It was a picture of her mother, afraid, in the grip of Kralik. She turned the photo
over, and it had the word 'COME' written on it. She showed it to Faith, who became just as
freaked as she was. They ran into the house to gather up all the weapons they could find.</p>

<p>Apparently, her world wasn't done disintegrating yet.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>In his office, Giles was trying to call Quentin, but all he got on the other end was
continuous ringing. In the next instant, the man he had been trying to contact walked in
and stood just inside the doorway. Giles put the phone back on the hook, and faced his
visitor, greeting him with glaring eyes.</p>

<p>"I was just trying to reach you."</p>

<p>"I was on watch over by the boardinghouse."</p>

<p>"Then you know what's happened."</p>

<p>"Yes." Quentin acknowledged with no emotion.</p>

<p>"He's killed Hobson and made Blair one of his own. Your perfectly controlled test seems to
have spun rather impressively out of control, don't you think?" Giles snapped at his
employer.</p>

<p>Quentin walked over to the teapot on the desk and lifted the lid to peer into its
contents.</p>

<p>"It changes nothing."</p>

<p>"Well, then, allow me. I've told them everything."</p>

<p>The older man looked up from the pot sharply, and set the lid back into place.</p>

<p>"That is in direct opposition to the Council's orders."</p>

<p>"Yes." Giles crossed his arms over his chest. "Interestingly, I don't give a rat's ass
about the Council's orders. There will be no test."</p>

<p> He watched as Quentin poured a cup of tea.</p>

<p>"The test has already begun. The slayers entered the field of play about ten minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I returned there just as they were entering."</p>

<p>Giles snatched his keys off the desk, and ran toward the door. His boss tried to get in
his way.</p>

<p>"Now Giles, we've no business..."</p>

<p>All he got for his efforts was a very angry watcher shoving him up against the doorframe.</p>

<p>"This is *not* business!"</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy and Faith made their way out of the sitting room of the boardinghouse, and went back
into the foyer. They had searched the room and found nothing. Now at the front door, they
found it shut and locked. Buffy could have sworn she put a stake there to keep it propped
open.</p>

<p>She looked at Faith, as she adjusted the strap of the bag of weapons they had brought, on
her shoulder. The brunette shrugged, checking the sight on the crossbow she was holding.
Buffy was getting nervous.</p>

<p>"Hey, remember when we went in that house outside of Boston that all the kids thought was
haunted?"</p>

<p>"Uh...yeah?" Faith answered, wondering where the blonde was going.</p>

<p>"It was really haunted, right?"</p>

<p>"Chandeliers don't normally fly across the room, smash into a wall, and then come back
together. I don't think that's normal, anyway. One of Casper's mean cousins was definitely
there."</p>

<p>"That's what I thought. Good."</p>

<p>There was quiet.</p>

<p>"B? Did you have a reason for bringing that up?"</p>

<p>"I'm just kinda scared right now, so I figured if I remembered something else scary,
traumatizing even, that I wouldn't be so scared of what we're doing now. Since that was a
mean ghost, and these are just vampires that are...hunting us."</p>

<p>"Okay." Faith said slowly, a little confused. She processed the words. "So...did it work?"</p>

<p>"Nope."</p>

<p>Blair growled then, coming up behind them. Faith whipped around and fired the bow, but it
flew past his face. He started to choke her, and she dropped the weapon. Stomping on his
foot caused him to loosen the hold he had, and Buffy grabbed a cross out of the bag, which
made him back off of Faith completely.</p>

<p>They ran back into the sitting room, and Blair came after them. Buffy tried to get another
weapon, but he took the bag from her, threw it across the room, and backhanded her hard to
the ground. Faith was standing by a bookcase that was up against the wall, and was using
all her strength to push on it, to knock it over.</p>

<p>"When I tell you to roll, do it." She told Buffy.</p>

<p>Faith waited until Blair was standing right in front of the bookcase, and at Buffy's feet.
She gave it a hard shove, and as the case started shaking, she yelled.</p>

<p>"Roll!"</p>

<p>Buffy did as she was told, and rolled out of the way as the books and shelf came crashing
down on Blair, trapping him.</p>

<p>Faith helped her to her feet, and looked at her eye. "You're gonna have a pretty wicked
shiner tomorrow."</p>

<p>The blonde touched her eye, seeing andirons leaning up against the fireplace. She grabbed
one, and began jabbing Blair's right eye with it, letting out her frustrations. Faith let
her go for a few seconds, understanding, but then calmly reminded her that they had to get
a move on.</p>

<p>The slayers headed for the steps, the only thing they had as defense, a single cross. They
couldn't find the bag.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Hide and seek..." Kralik taunted them from somewhere before they could reach the
staircase. They began searching. "Hide and seek!"</p>

<p>Buffy pointed to the crate in the adjacent room, and Faith nodded. It appeared locked, but
appearances were deceiving. They cautiously crept up to it, each getting on a side of the
crate. Buffy was by the handle. Sure they had no obvious way to take him out, but they had
to do something. Surprising them both, the door flew open. It connected with Faith's head,
and because there was so much force, she dropped.</p>

<p>Kralik stepped out, holding their bag. He and Buffy stared at one another.</p>

<p>"Why did you come to the dark of the woods?" He asked, dropping the bag on the floor and
stepping on it. "To bring all these sweets to grandmother's house?"</p>

<p>He grabbed her shirt, and pulled her close to him. Buffy held up the cross, her arm
shaking. Kralik used his other arm, and pulled the cross to his chest. Buffy could see
smoke coming off of him, but he seemed to be enjoying it. He even started moving it
around, laughing.</p>

<p>"Oh...oh, no, no. Just a little lower. Right...oh, yes. Yes. Oh." He gasped. "Ooh! Thank
you very much."</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to him, and to Buffy, Faith had gotten up. She jumped onto Kralik's back, and
wrapped her arms around his neck, squeezing. Growling, he freed Buffy, and she used the
opportunity to bring her hands together and drive her elbows into Kralik's chest. He
stumbled, but quickly kicked her in the stomach, which sent her flying. He then flipped
Faith over his head, and onto her back.</p>

<p>Buffy dragged herself over to Faith, and Kralik just watched. They got up slowly, leaning
on each other for support, as they stumbled and limped their way to, and up, the steps.
The vampire just grinned, making no move to pursue. As far as he was concerned, the game
was just beginning.</p>

<p>They got to the top, hurried as quickly as they could down the hallway before them, and
went through the first unlocked door they came across. Faith shut the door, bathing them
in darkness. Buffy groped the wall until she found the light switch, and flipped it,
allowing them to see. She rather wished she hadn't, because then she saw what was on the
walls.</p>

<p>Polaroids of her frightened, restrained mother. Faith took one off.</p>

<p>"Christ. He's -"</p>

<p>"A sick bastard?" Buffy continued, trying very hard to keep her composure.</p>

<p>"That's the clean version of what I was thinking, but yeah." Faith tried to calm her
breathing. "We'll get to her."</p>

<p>"Oh, damn right we will."</p>

<p>Kralik punched through the door they had just come through, making them jump.</p>

<p>"Doesn't he rest?" The brunette asked.</p>

<p>They went out the door on the other side of the room, and ended up in another hallway. Not
caring which direction, they just moved. Before they got to the end, Kralik stepped out in
front of them, and grabbed Buffy's throat. He pushed on her head, revealing her neck. He
challenged Faith with his eyes. He wanted her to try something.</p>

<p>When she didn't, he looked at the flesh, the veins, that were exposed to him and licked
his lips.</p>

<p>"I won't take it all. I won't take it all." He said soothingly.</p>

<p>Buffy was helpless no matter what she tried. Squeezing her eyes shut, she waited...but the
fangs never made contact. Kralik shoved her into the wall, and she saw his face contorted
in pain. Then he started moaning, reaching for something in his pocket. When he retrieved
the pill bottle, Faith saw it, and took it right out of his hands. Buffy realized they had
an advantage now, and took off back down the hallway with Faith, as the hurting vampire
screamed.</p>

<p>"No, no, no!"</p>

<p>Passing the room with the pictures, the girls saw a laundry chute, gave one another a
look, and dove in.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>In the basement, Joyce watched as Buffy landed on a table, exiting the chute. It broke,
and then Faith came out, landing on her daughter.</p>

<p>"Never thought I'd ever say what I'm gonna say, but cause of this damn test, I may hate
this position for the rest of my life." Faith remarked, laying atop Buffy and coughing
from the dust.</p>

<p>The blonde whispered. "Faith! My mom's over there! She may be immobile, but...glare
power." She and her cringing partner got up and walked over to Joyce.</p>

<p>Buffy removed the gag, much to her mother's relief, and Faith tried to work on the ropes.</p>

<p>"Oh thank God!"</p>

<p>"You okay, mom?" Joyce nodded. "Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"I'm fine, Buffy, but we have to get out of -"</p>

<p>She stopped when they all heard pounding on the basement door. It swung open, and Kralik
stumbled down the stairs, enraged.</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>He didn't see the girls exchange items. Faith went over to the wine rack, as Buffy tried
to run past him. Kralik saw that she had the bottle in her hand, and took his pills back,
popping a few. He walked back to where Faith was, and she held out a glass of water to
him. He gulped the liquid down, swallowing his medication.</p>

<p>"You don't seem to understand your place in all of this." Kralik pointed at Faith, and
then turned and pointed at Buffy. "Do you have any idea..."</p>

<p>His eyes bugged out suddenly, and he ceased his lecture. He was having pains again, but in
his chest this time. It was strange.</p>

<p>"Oh, my! What have you..." He was shaking now, realizing what had been in the glass. "My
pills!"</p>

<p>Faith held up an empty bottle of holywater for him to see as his body smoked from within.</p>

<p>"You like that you son of a bitch?" Kralik shook his head as he combusted. "Good. You
weren't supposed to."</p>

<p>Before they could relax, Blair came out from the wine racks and lunged for them. But Giles
was also there, and he staked the vampire. Once they all started breathing again, Giles
and Buffy looked at one another for what seemed like a really tense, forever. Eventually,
he came over and helped to untie a disturbed Joyce.</p>

<p>"We did it." Buffy sighed.</p>

<p>"Gee, I hope the Council's pleased." Faith said sarcastically, pretending to care. She
said it just to see the guilt on the watcher's face.</p>

<p>When Joyce was free, she thanked Giles, and the slayers hugged, glad to be alive.</p>

<p>"I have a question, Faith." The older Summers said on the way out. "What exactly did you
mean by 'position'?"</p>

<p>"Uh..."</p>

<p>The stuttering continued all the way back to the house.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p> When they reached their destination, Quentin was standing on the porch waiting. They all
went inside and sat in the living room. Despite the awkwardness, and intense dislike
directed at him, he spoke to the two girls with a smile on his face.</p>

<p>"Congratulations, you passed. You both exhibited -"</p>

<p>"Do we get gold stars?" Buffy deadpanned, interrupting him.</p>

<p>"Or even brownie points?" Faith asked, matching her girlfriend's tone.</p>

<p>"I understand that you're upset..."</p>

<p>"You understand *nothing*." She was struggling to keep her temper in check. "You set that
monster loose, and he came after my mother."</p>

<p>"You think the test was unfair?"</p>

<p>"I think you better stop, before you really piss her off. And me." Faith advised.</p>

<p>"We're not in the business of fair, ladies. We're fighting a war."</p>

<p>"You're *waging* a war. They're fighting it. There is a difference." Giles spoke up.</p>

<p>"Mr. Giles, if you don't mind..."</p>

<p>"The test is done. We're finished."</p>

<p>"Not quite. They passed. You didn't. I've recommended to the Council, and they've agreed,
that you be relieved of your duties as Watcher immediately. You're fired."</p>

<p>Everyone was taken aback.</p>

<p>"On what grounds?"</p>

<p>"Your affection for your charge has rendered you incapable of clear and impartial
judgment." Buffy looked at Giles. "You have a father's love for the child, and that is
useless to the cause. Also, you show signs of developing that same affection for your
temporary one as well."</p>

<p>"'Temporary one'? What? You don't know my name? Or you just don't care what it is?" Faith
asked. Quentin didn't respond. "Okay, now I'm pissed off."</p>

<p>She didn't move, though. She just stared at Giles along with Buffy.</p>

<p>"We were even considering giving you the responsibility of both girls, but obviously,
because of your performance this evening, that can no longer be. We think it would be best
if you had no further contact with the slayers."</p>

<p>"I'm not going anywhere." Giles said adamantly.</p>

<p> "No, well, I didn't expect you would adhere to that. However, if you interfere with the
new Watcher, or countermand his authority in any way, you will be dealt with. Are we
clear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we're very clear."  Shades of 'Ripper' shone in his eyes at that statement.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir," Joyce was speaking finally, "but I'm afraid you've overstayed your
welcome. Get the hell out of my house."</p>

<p>Quentin nodded to the room, and quietly made his exit.</p>

<p>"All right, mom!" Buffy cheered.</p>

<p>"I'm in awe." Faith said.</p>

<p>"Mr. Giles, would you...like some coffee?" Joyce asked sympathetically.</p>

<p>He smiled sadly. "No thank you. It's late, and I should be getting home. You all make sure
to get lots of rest. Goodnight." He took a step, but then turned back around and looked at
Buffy and Faith. "I knew you could do it."</p>

<p>Then he left, leaving the girls to do what they had tried to avoid earlier that night.
Think.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Least I kept up my birthday tradition of gut-wrenching misery and horror." Buffy said the
next day in the presence of the gang. And her mother, who was making lunch.</p>

<p>They were all gathered in the kitchen, standing around the counter. Faith and Buffy were
the only ones sitting. Their legs were weary, after all.</p>

<p>"*We* kept it up." Faith corrected with a grin.</p>

<p>"Kralik drank holywater, huh?" Oz asked.</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>"Impressive."</p>

<p>"Thanks." The slayers' echoed, cockily.</p>

<p>"I can't believe Giles was fired. How could Giles get fired?" Willow exclaimed.</p>

<p>"He's still librarian, Will. Giles isn't going anywhere." Buffy assured the redhead.</p>

<p>There was quite a bit of healing left to do where he was concerned, but she and Faith had
begun to see his side. How much pressure he had been under, and how much he really
*didn't* want to, but the fact was that he still had. They'd slowly, but surely, get back
to full trust again.</p>

<p>"So how long before the chemical wears off?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"Two or three days."</p>

<p>"No strength?</p>

<p>"Beyond lifting pom-poms? Nope." Buffy smirked.</p>

<p>"Hey!" Cordelia said defensively.</p>

<p>Her boyfriend started to grin, and then Faith got off her seat and walked up to him.</p>

<p>"Shoe's untied." She said.</p>

<p>Xander reached down, and she gave him a little push, which caused him to lose his balance
and fall flat on his rear end.</p>

<p>"Don't get any ideas of pulling any macho superiority crap, cause I can still kick your
ass. Got it?" Faith instructed him with her sweetest, fake smile.</p>

<p>"Yes ma'am." He quivered.</p>

<p>The gang had to hold in the laughter that wanted to burst out of their mouths.</p>
