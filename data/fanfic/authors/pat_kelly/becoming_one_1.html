<!-- Becoming One \ Part 1: New Times -->

<p>The cemetery at night was a dangerous place in Sunnydale. All sorts of creatures from the darkest recesses of the human mind emerged from or hung around it. Tonight it was the latter of the two. No, no graves had been escaped from, but that wasn't to say that they weren't opened.</P>
<p>Someone ran quickly down a row of headstones, heading for a mausoleum. Behind them, a rather large, dark-blue creature was following. Although humanoid in form, the creature's piercing purple eyes, and the fact that it had long, sharp silver spikes seeping out from every orifice on its body, quickly proved to anyone who saw it, that it was far from human.</P>
<p>When it reached the entrance to the mausoleum, it growled a warning to whoever had gone inside. Suddenly appearing inside the doorway, Buffy Summers' form stood motionless, looking in the creature's direction. Wasting no time, it swiped its arm, which sliced right through the Slayer.</P>
<p>However, she just vanished into thin air, going up in a whisk of smoke. Obviously perplexed, the creature's confusion turned to anger and it howled in rage. Coming up from behind, Buffy grabbed it by the neck, and threw it down to the ground.</P>
<p>"D'you like that? I can saw myself in half too." It got up and stood in front of her. She pulled a knife blade from her back pocket. "Hurts like hell in the morning, but it's great at parties."</P>
<p>The creature started to shake violently, screaming. It then exploded outward, its flesh and insides splattering Buffy's outfit, face, and hair. She was blinded so much by it, that for a second, she almost missed dodging a spike that came directly at her head.</P>
<p>She slipped off her jacket, turned it inside out, and wiped her face.</P>
<p>"Coast is clear." Buffy said.</P>
<p>Willow emerged wearily from the mausoleum, stumbling down the steps. Fearing she might fall, Buffy rushed and caught her.</P>
<p>"Did it work?"</P>
<p>"Like a charm. Took a lot out of you, didn't it?"</P>
<p>"No, I'm fine…" Willow's body was completely relaxed, and her eyelids were drooping.</P>
<p>"I told you that you were pushing the witch stuff too fast. That must have been a heavy spell."</P>
<p>"It was, but if it can fool the bad guys into thinking you're someplace you're not…" She yawned.</P>
<p>"It can be a big help. I know. Come on let's get to the apartment before you collapse."</P>
<p>"I'm glad they let us move our stuff in a day early."</P>
<p>"Yeah, it's time to really test the shower. What was that thing again?"</P>
<p>"A noccoti. Instead of letting the thing they're hunting get the better of them…"</P>
<p>"They get their prey all icky, and leave them with permanent stains on their new outfits. Do I want to know what's all over me?"</P>
<p>"Nothing really. Just demon goop. Well…"</P>
<p>"Well what?"</P>
<p>"If they fed recently, you'll have…um…dead flesh on you."</P>
<p>Buffy sniffed her arm. The flesh was rotted, and unmistakably human. She got a revolted, 'I'm going to vomit' look on her face, and said the first thing that came to her lips.</P>
<P>"Eeew!" </P>

<hr width=100>

<p>They reached the door to their room, and a piece of paper was tacked to it. Willow tore it off, and turned the knob so they could enter the room. Buffy immediately ran into the shower, and Willow fell down on the bed. They had moved the two beds together, so they had a lot of room inside.</P>
<p>Willow had a brand new desktop computer that her parents had purchased for her, set up on the desk in the room. Pictures of the two of them, some alone, some with Xander and Oz, which were taken over the summer, were on the desk as well. Buffy's Mr. Gordo, was on top of the monitor, and her supplies were in the chest under the bed.</P>
<p>Willow started to read the paper.</P>
<p>" 'Attention all on-campus freshmen, if you have not yet registered for your classes, the registration office will accept people starting at six o'clock but no later than 9:30 tomorrow morning. The lines will be long, so it is advised that you get there as early as possible.</P>
<p>" 'Also the campus store will be open for text purchases starting at 6:30. Have a good year.'  See?" </P>
<p>"See what? That the Hellmouth is getting more inventive? " Buffy asked over the noise of the water.</P>
<p>"That too, but aren't you glad we registered months ago for the courses?"</P>
<p>"Is this your way of saying I told you so?"</P>
<p>"Yes."</P>
<p>A few minutes later, Buffy stepped out of the bathroom, putting on flannel pants and a nightshirt. She flopped down next to Willow.</P>
<p>"You wanna use the shower?"</P>
<p>"Just wanna sleep."</P>
<p>"I'm gonna have a hell of a time taking my clothes down to the washroom tomorrow. I can picture the stares already."</P>
<p>Willow yawned. "Cordelia would have a panic attack."</P>
<p>"When's the last time she wrote?"</P>
<p>"Two weeks ago. She said her place was better, but she was still looking for work."</P>
<p>"I hope she makes it."</P>
<p>"Me too." Buffy pulled back the covers, and picked up Willow's feet, helping her underneath. "And Oz should be here tomorrow. He got that place with the band off campus."</P>
<p>"What about Xander? He's been going from job to job lately."</P>
<P>"He could've gotten in if he had just tried a little harder. Not all the classes are as difficult or advanced as the ones we took." She sighed, sad that Xander didn't seem to want to do anything with his life. "But…we have English together, right?"</P>
<P>"Yep, first thing. So we should," Willow had fallen asleep on her shoulder, "get some sleep."</P>
<P>Buffy smiled, and followed her soon after. Tomorrow, college began.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>As she moved through her day, Buffy realized something about college teachers. Unlike high school teachers who pretended to care about you but you knew they really didn't, college ones made it a point to make it perfectly clear that they didn't give a damn.</P>
<I><P>'Whoever said honesty is the best policy must have been one hell of a liar.'</P>
</I><P>English wasn't so bad. Willow had found it interesting, and so that carried over to Buffy. As long as Willow was there to help her out, she could stay headache free. And that was hard to do considering each class was filled with what seemed like a million people. How was she supposed to learn with that many people clamoring for the attention of one professor?</P>
<P>What really stunk was that Willow was not in any of her other classes. She could've dealt with that if she found someone else from Sunnydale High. By the end of the year, she had been on friendly terms with most everybody, but here she felt lost in a sea of strangers. </P>
<P>Her criminology class was going to be challenging. Of course, she had to get the oldest guy in the world as a teacher, but it was neat. Sure it had a lot to do with theories, memorization, and abstract ideas, but trying to understand why criminals and killers did the things they did, would definitely be an experience. Probably a frightening one too. Sometimes she forgot that there were people who could be just as bad as demons. Or worse. </P>
<P>Her classes were over for the day, but Willow's weren't. If she remembered correctly, Willow had about an hour before her next class, so she was trying to find her so they could have lunch. On her way to the food court, she met up with Oz.</P>
<P>"Hey Oz."</P>
<P>"Hi, Buffy. Higher education. Bizarre."</P>
<P>"You too, huh?"</P>
<P>"Seems like most of the staff here are high school teacher rejects, and they look at college as a punishment. It's one thing to come here with the band and play, but getting involved in this place…"</P>
<P>"I'm right there with ya, but at least you know people."</P>
<P>"Yeah, but after voluntarily not graduating for five years, while the guys you knew left on time, there tends to be distance. Looking for Will?"</P>
<P>"You seen her?"</P>
<P>"She should just be coming out of the computer lab."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>"Thanks, Willow. I'll see you tomorrow, right?" A girl asked in the computer lab.</P>
<P>"Sure. It's really simple once you get past that command. You'll see." Willow gathered her stuff and made her way out of the lab. </P>
<P>College was, well, great. Challenging was the word that kept popping into her mind. And that's what she needed. She never really felt challenged in high school. Not that she didn't enjoy it, but she never felt, academic wise, that she had learned much. </P>
<P>College was different. At the start, she was a little unnerved at the fact that the professors didn't seem to think of you as an individual, and instead just another part of the mass. She had always tried to get to know her teachers. It was in her nature to be friendly towards people. She just looked at her professors as another challenge.</P>
<P>If she wanted to be recognized, she'd have to earn it, have to work for it, and prove herself. And she was more than willing.</P>
<P>People didn't look down on her either. The word nerd or geek was not coming out of anybody's mouth when they saw her. Everybody was the same, struggling to get through their classes, and they looked to fellow students for help. Willow was appreciated here, and she felt good.</P>
<P>She hoped Buffy was doing okay. As they were leaving English, Buffy had seemed lost. She knew it was all a new and somewhat overwhelming experience, and it wasn't like she hadn't felt it. But she looked on the positive side of it, whereas Buffy always tended to go negative. </P>
<P>College made you feel so small, so insignificant, and she guessed that was why people joined sororities and fraternities. Beyond the partying and drinking, they were places where people could go so they didn't feel so small anymore. That's what it was really. About people sticking together, and helping each other get through the four years that was higher education.</P>
<P>On that thought, she sped up her pace, and went to find Buffy.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P> </P>
<P>Underground, in a cave-like structure, the Noccoti tribe was huddled around a primitively made fire. Lining the walls were deceased human bodies, all in various stages of decay. Some were partially eaten; some were not. The leader sat and watched as one of the lesser slaves threw a body onto the fire.</P>
<P>This meal was one in memory of a fallen member. The one who had died honorably in battle with the Slayer. They may have been primitive, but they took death of warriors very hard. The leader grabbed a slick, blue object up into his hand, and held it above his head.</P>
<P>The others bowed in respect to the heart of the fallen warrior. As he dropped it into the fire, growls of anger and pain echoed through the cave.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>They both decided after trying to search for each other, that if they just went to the food court, they'd eventually see one another. Sure enough, they walked in at the same time. They headed over to a table.</P>
<P>"I feel like a moron. I've been looking for you everywhere." Willow said.</P>
<P>"Then consider me Moron Number Two." Buffy said. </P>
<P>"So how was your guys days?" Willow asked Buffy and Oz.</P>
<P>"I pretty much blanked it out." Oz said.</P>
<P>"It was okay, I guess. It's gonna take some getting used to."</P>
<P>"I know what you mean, but it'll get better. I met all these cool people though…"</P>
<P>Buffy listened as Willow talked excitedly about her classes, and how great the people were. </P>
<I><P>'I still haven't learned from her. Here she is happy, and I can't be. What's wrong with me?'</P>
</I><P>Willow looked at her and frowned. Oz had been around them enough to know what was going on, so he excused himself from the table.</P>
<P>"Nothing's wrong with you. I'm too happy. It's a flaw."</P>
<P>"That's not a flaw, it's a gift."</P>
<P>"Maybe you can't be super happy all the time, but don't let it get you down. We both have a chance to start over here. Nobody's judging you, Buffy. They don't know who you are."</P>
<P>"Isn't that the problem?"</P>
<P>"No way. You can make friends easily. You're a very likeable person, Buffy. All you have to do is make an effort. You're not known as a delinquent here. You don't have a reputation. You're just Buffy Summers, college freshman."</P>
<P>"Okay, when did we switch roles?"</P>
<P>Willow smiled. "I'm just as unknown as you are. We'll both make friends and do well. Together."</P>
<P>"I like the sound of that."</P>
<P>Willow looked at her watch. "Got one more class."</P>
<P>"Then I'll meet you later?"</P>
<P>"We going grave hopping again?"</P>
<P>"Unless you didn't want to."</P>
<P>"You kidding? I love graveyards. Later Buffy."</P>
<P>"Have fun."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy sat in the apartment, reading through some of the different clubs and her course texts. She was going to do well. She was. She was going to get involved. The cordless phone rang, on the dresser, and she picked it up.</P>
<P>(Hello?)</P>
<P>(Hello, Buffy. How are things?)</P>
<P>(Hey Giles! Things are okay. I really wish you could've come up here with us)</P>
<P>(I tried, honestly. They weren't hiring, unfortunately)</P>
<P>(Don't let bachelor life go to your head, okay? It would gross me out)</P>
<P>He chuckled into the phone. (I found out more about the Noccoti)</P>
<P>(I killed him. Not to worry)</P>
<P>(Yes, well the one you killed was part of a tribe)</P>
<P>(How come I don't like where this is going?)</P>
<P>(Most likely, they'll come after you out of revenge for their fallen comrade)</P>
<P>(Well that's just great)</P>
<P>(Do you want me to come up?)</P>
<P>(No I can handle -)</P>
<P>A scream came from the ground floor of the building.</P>
<p>(Buffy, what was that? Is everything all right?)</P>
<p>She ignored him, and ran down the stairs to the crowd that had gathered at the guard station. The door was smashed, and Buffy pushed her way through. On the ground, the mangled body of a security guard was huddled next to his head.</P>
<p>"I came in…and I saw this thing…he looked at me…oh My God!" A girl frantically said.</P>
<p>Buffy looked up from the body, to the girl, and then to Willow who had just gotten in.</P>
<p>(Giles, I think you better get up here)</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Later, the whole gang was back together, following the trail of bodies the creatures had left for them.</P>
<p>"Why don't they just come attack me? They killed four people and I couldn't stop it."</P>
<p>"They're calling you out." Xander said who had come along with Giles.</P>
<p>"These are creatures of honor. This was their way of challenging you openly." Giles said.</P>
<p>"The body count that seems to be leading somewhere, could also mean trap." Oz said.</P>
<p>"That's what I'm thinking." Willow agreed.</P>
<p>"What else have we got to go on? I just wanna stop these things before they do anymore…" Buffy trailed off, and stopped. They were a few blo cks off campus now, and they had just entered Breakers Woods. In front of them was a large bloodstained rock, and above that, hanging from a tree, was a skinned buck carcass.</P>
<p>"At least they stopped with people." Xander said.</P>
<p>They looked around, and saw nothing. Oz started to smell the air.</P>
<p>"Under us." He put his hand to his nose, trying to stop smelling. "Human flesh. Cooked."</P>
<p>They went to move the rock. </P>
<p>"Everybody take weapons. Swords. Take them out before they…" Buffy looked at Willow.</P>
<p>"It's not pretty."</P>
<p></P>
<hr width=100>

<p>A thick mist began to fill the cave. The creatures had heard them coming, but became disoriented. One climbed out of the large hole, and stuck his head above ground. A second later, his head and body fell back down.</P>
<p>The creatures, enraged, jumped out in twos, and knocked Buffy down. There were eight of them total. </P>
<p>"At least they're out in the open now." Buffy said.</P>
<p>While they still were all huddled together, Xander and Oz took advantage and came at a creature from behind, and stuck both their swords through its back. It fell. The remaining six split up, three went after Buffy and Willow, the others after the guys.</P>
<p>"Their leader's still underground!" Giles said, grabbing his one of his assailant's spikes on the head, and twisting. The thing growled in pain and shoved him down.</P>
<p>"So?!" Buffy called, trying to kick one, but instead cutting her leg.</P>
<p>"Kill the leader, stop the rest." Willow said, swinging her sword and just clanging it against a chest spike.</P>
<p>"Go! We'll hold them off!" Xander yelled.</P>
<p>Buffy grabbed Willow and tossed her as gently as possible, out of harm's way. </P>
<p><I>'Don't mess up.' </I> Willow told herself.</P>
<p>She started to chant. "You are blinded. She does not appear. Vocus! Torili! She vanishes!"</P>
<p>Buffy stood in place for a minute, and looked at her three confused attackers. She sprinted quickly, and dropped into the hole.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In the cave, the only thing Buffy could see was the fire. As she got closer, she saw the bodies. Dozens piled up on top of one another. Before she could think too much, she heard a growl.</P>
<p>She spun around, but couldn't see anything. She picked up a piece of wood, and lit it on the flames. The leader rushed her, but she jumped to the side. She held the flaming piece of wood out in front of her, warning off the snarling leader.</P>
<p>He stood there, and they were eyeing each other. He took a step closer, and so did Buffy. After a few moments they ran at each other. The leader was quicker, and he grabbed her by the throat, lifting her off the ground.</P>
<p>He opened his mouth, and his jaws were sharp and gleaming off the firelight created by the makeshift torch Buffy still held in her hand. She shoved it into his throat, and he dropped her. She backed up, and watched.</P>
<p>The leader was choking. As he clamped down with his jaws and snapped the wood that was gagging him, the flame spread, destroying him. With one final roar, flame shot through his head, bursting it. His lifeless body dropped to the ground.</P>
<p>Above, Buffy heard silence, and then a collective roar. Rushing out of the cave, she went to help her friends.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>When she got up top, she saw an extremely disgusting scene. Demon innards were all over the place. Not to mention on her friends. She didn't see Willow though, who came up behind her. She was clean.</P>
<p>"I tried to warn them." Willow said.</P>
<p>Buffy smirked as the three, goop covered, and most likely flesh covered, people stood in front of them.</P>
<p>"Thanks for the help."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Several hours later, after everyone insisted on using their shower, Buffy and Willow were alone once more. Oz had returned to the band's place, and Giles and Xander had gone home.</P>
<p>"So, did Xander say anything to you about -" Buffy started.</P>
<p>"Nope. I'm scared for him. Life wise. Eventually, he won't be able to coast anymore, and his parents will kick him out…"	</P>
<p>"He'll be okay. We'll force him to let us help."</P>
<p>"He does need to be forced."</P>
<p>"Then we're just the gals to do it. You really came through tonight. Two spells almost in a row. You okay?"</P>
<p>"I'm fine. Those were nothing like the one last night. Making another you is hard work. Pretty darn good duplicate if I do say so myself."</P>
<p>"You better be happy with the original." Buffy said kissing her.</P>
<p>"How could I not be?" Willow kissed back.</P>
<p>"What a way to start off the year, huh?"</P>
<p>"Is it any different then any other year?"</P>
<p>"No, and you know what? For once that might not be bad. Might not be as different as I thought."</P>
<p>"Positive energy. See? It's a good thing."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Little did they know that positive energy wasn't going to cut it. It only got you so far, and they'd need a lot more than that to face the challenges ahead. In an abandoned mansion, a blood red flash tore into the air, and an old enemy emerged.</P>
<P>"Buffy…hope she didn't miss me too much." Angelus said with an evil glint in his eyes.  With a walk all his own, went out in search of dinner. He was starving.</P>
