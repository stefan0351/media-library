<p>Willow watched Buffy from her lounging position in the Bronze. Buffy was in line to get drinks. Four days after the Council’s "test" her strength returned. One day, the door to her house had been stuck, so she kept turning the knob. Out of frustration, she broke it clean off the door.</P>
<p>If the knob hadn’t broken, she wouldn’t have realized her ability had come back to her. Willow knew what her distraction was, because she had the same problem. They were both on Cloud Nine since their intimate night together. The whole world seemed to disappear before their eyes. </P>
<p>They had become closer, and they had thought that impossible, but it happened. Willow didn’t know if it had something to do with Buffy’s slayerness or something else, but she seemed to know what Buffy was thinking, and vice versa. It was more an emotional connection that just seemed to keep growing. The more it did, the more words were unnecessary. Looking into each other’s eyes had suddenly become a whole conversation. </P>
<p>And that was the difference between love and sex. Sex stopped at the physical end, but making love encompassed everything. Mind, body, and soul. Willow wouldn’t have believed people who told her that. Not if she hadn’t experienced it herself. And now it was like everything else didn’t matter.</P>
<p><I>‘School matters.’ </I>She reminded herself.</P>
<p>What didn’t seem to matter was the Hellmouth, Vampires, all the problems went away. She knew she’d have to face the warped reality that was her life eventually, but right now she was avoiding it at all costs.</P>
<p>As Buffy started to come over with the drinks, Willow saw her freeze up. Wondering what was wrong, Willow tried to find the source of the problem. The problem was in front of her. Towering over her it seemed. </P>
<p>"Hiya, Red."</P>
<p>Willow drew in a breath. Faith was one problem she wished she hadn’t forgotten about.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy immediately dropped the two cups of scalding hot mocha on the floor, and ran up behind Faith. The other slayer sensed her this time, and crouched. Buffy’s punch missed, and the strength that was behind it knocked her off balance. Surprisingly enough, Faith was the one who stopped her fall.</P>
<p>"I was already knocked out by you once, B. I’d like to avoid it this time. Look, I know I was somewhat…rude before, and I’m sorry. We five-by-five?"</P>
<p><I>‘What’s with the act?’ </I> Buffy and Willow thought at the same time.</P>
<p>"Back away from Willow."</P>
<p>"You think I was gonna hurt my buddy over here?"</P>
<p>"I’m not your buddy." Willow said adamantly.</P>
<p>"Even after all the quality time we spent together? I’m hurt, really."</P>
<p>Buffy kept her anger under control.</P>
<p>"What do you want, Faith?"</P>
<p>"Patrol, remember? I mean now that you’re back to full power, we’ve got a job to do."</P>
<p>"I…already did my sweep tonight."</P>
<p>Both Buffy and Willow were a little scared now. Faith had known Buffy had lost her strength?</P>
<p>"Well, I’m sure there’s some more roaming around somewhere. Someone once told me, something about vamps. They said, ‘They'll hit a street even after you've been there.’ Who could it be? You don’t know, do you?"</P>
<p><I>‘Damn you.’ </I>Buffy thought.</P>
<p>"Let’s go."</P>
<p>Willow looked at Buffy. She knew what Buffy wanted, it was written all over her face. It said, ‘Go get everyone, and hurry.’ As soon Faith and Buffy left the Bronze, Willow walked out, heading in the opposite direction that she saw them go.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Faith and Buffy walked through the graveyard. There had been no sign of any vampires at all. But Faith seemed hyped on acting, so Buffy went along with it. She wanted to see where it led.</P>
<p>After about ten more minutes, Buffy had had enough. She stopped walking.</P>
<p>"Okay, Faith. Drop it."</P>
<p>Faith faced her. "Drop what?"</P>
<p>"The dutiful slayer act."</P>
<p>"Dutiful?"</P>
<p>"We know, Faith, so just spare me, okay?"</P>
<p>"Oh, you don’t know the half of it, B."</P>
<p>"Then why don’t you tell me?"</P>
<p>"Now if I wanted to tell you, I could’ve done that awhile ago. But seeing as how I haven’t, do you really think I’m gonna spill?"</P>
<p>"Then what’re we doing out here? Look, if you wanna kill me, let’s get started. Otherwise, I’m leaving."</P>
<p>Faith walked up to Buffy and whispered to her.</P>
<p>"If I wanted to kill you, I would’ve done it when you were throwing girlie punches." Faith backed away. "Actually, I wanted to kill you, but the boss had another idea."</P>
<p>"And what’s that?"</P>
<p>"Come join the winning team."</P>
<p>"Don’t think so."</P>
<p>"Then kill me."</P>
<p>"What?"</P>
<p>"You heard me. You know that from now on I’ll come after you, so the only way you’ll get rid of me is to kill me. Come on." Buffy looked at the ground. "You can’t can you? You can’t kill a person."</P>
<p>"Of course not."</P>
<p>"Then that’s why you’ll lose. You think humans are any better than demons? Am I better than a demon?"</P>
<p>"Yes."</P>
<p>Faith was shocked for a moment.</P>
<p>"You know I’m not on your side, so why are you still…"</P>
<P>Buffy finally realized something that should have occurred to her long ago.	</P>
<P>"Because you haven’t done anything wrong. Yet."</P>
<p>"Excuse me?"</P>
<p>"I’m sure you’ve killed tons of demons, right? Whoever this boss is, he must have tons of enemies that need to be taken out. But not once has he asked you to kill a human. Has he Faith?"</P>
<p>"Sure he has." Faith said with some uncertainty in her eyes. "You."</P>
<p>"Oh, right. Me. You could’ve killed me. You knew I lost my strength, right? You could’ve killed me easily then. Not to mention Willow, or Giles, or Xander. But you didn’t. And you know why?"</P>
<p>Buffy stepped up to her.</P>
<p>"Because you can’t. Even as rebellious as you may think you are, somebody must have done something right, because you’ve never killed a human being. You know killing a person is murder, and you can’t do that. It’s built into Slayers."</P>
<p>"What about my Watcher?"</P>
<p>"Oh, you never killed her. In fact, I’m sure you were close. You can’t help but bond with your Watcher. Kakistos killed her like you said. Out of a need to survive you joined up with him, because you knew you’d never beat him. Over time, you became so cold and distant that you convinced yourself that dealing with vampires was the way to go. You probably even blocked out the real truth of what happened.</P>
<p>"When you came here and told us your story, I knew it was true, but I could tell you were trying to hide the truth of your words from yourself. You’ve been surrounded by an evil influence for so long that you can’t even trust yourself or your own memories anymore. You knew we cared about you, and it scared you. That’s why you didn’t kill us. Nobody has cared about you for a long time, have they?"</P>
<p>Faith shrugged the question off, and tried to make her face as expressionless as possible.</P>
<p>"How do you know you’re right?"</P>
<p>"I’ve seen killers eyes. I looked into them every time I looked into Angel’s. There was so much pain, anguish, and rage he focused on himself. There were things going on in his head that I couldn’t even begin to understand. When he became all demon again, the rage multiplied, and the joy of killing came back to him. It was all in his eyes. You don’t have the look.</P>
<p>"You have the eyes of someone lost, someone confused. Let us help you."</P>
<p>Faith was holding together, but in another second Buffy knew she was going to break.</P>
<p>"I have everything straight. The boss takes care of me, and that’s all that matters."</P>
<p>"Faith…"</P>
<p>Suddenly, several vampires jumped seemingly, from out of nowhere.</P>
<p>"You’re right, B. I can’t kill you. But they have no problems giving it a shot. If you’re still alive afterwards, the offer’s still on the table." Faith said, and ran off.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p><I>‘Damn. How does she know me so well?’ </I>Faith thought to herself as she ran off to her "apartment".</P>
<p>Buffy laid out her entire life in a matter of a few minutes. And it shocked her. Nobody had ever tried to figure her out. Well, the boss did. She liked him. He gave her free reign, gave her everything she asked for, and in his own way, cared for her. But she wasn’t close to him. She wouldn’t allow herself to get close to anyone. All they ended up doing was turning on you.</P>
<p><I>‘Buffy just thinks I’m a pity case. Screw her. She thinks she can tell me all about myself, and save me? She doesn’t care about me, she just thinks it’s her duty to rescue everyone from themselves.’</P>
</I><p>Faith quickened her pace, trying to block out all her emotions. They just confused things more. She didn’t see a person run her direction, and they ran into on another. They both fell to the ground, landing on their backsides.</P>
<p>Faith looked at the person. Willow.</P>
<p><I>‘Figures.’</P>
<p></I>Faith got up slowly, and Willow shot up. Faith could see everyone else running up towards them. Willow was shaking visibly. If it were any other time, she might have taken joy in Willow’s fear. She just stared at her.</P>
<p>"Don’t you have a friend to save?" She ran off.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Let’s see," Buffy said aloud in the middle of a circle of ten vampires, "how do I get out of this one?" </P>
<p>The vampires weren’t moving.</P>
<p><I>‘Gee, I love it when they let me make the first move.’</P>
<P> </I>	She saw a broken tree limb five feet in front of her. As she took a cautious step towards it, the vampires took two steps towards her. </P>
<p>"Ring around the Slayer. Great." Buffy muttered.</P>
<p>Just then, Xander barreled through two vampires, knocking them down, joining Buffy in the center. The vampires got up, and started to growl.</P>
<p>"Nice of you to make it." Buffy said as the vampires advanced.</P>
<p>"Glad to be here."</P>
<p>"You bring a weapon?"</P>
<p>"Weapon?" Buffy sighed. "At least I knocked them down."</P>
<p>"They got back up, Xander."</P>
<p>"Then I guess it’s a good thing vampires don’t play football. We’d have no chance in hell at the Superbowl."</P>
<p>Buffy got closer to Xander, as the vampires got continually closer as well.</P>
<p>"The guys with you?" He nodded. "What are they packing?"</P>
<p>"Crossbow, Super Soaker with holywater, stakes…"</P>
<p>She saw the branch again, and saw the tree, which it had fallen from. </P>
<p><I>‘Looks pretty sturdy.’</P>
<p></I>"I never thought I’d say this, but I need to get on top of you." Xander leered at her. "On your shoulders. I want you to pick up that tree branch. I’m going to jump from you to the tree up there to get higher. Take the branch, stake a guy, and get out. Got it?"</P>
<p>Xander grabbed the tree branch as the vampires rushed at them. Buffy kicked the closest one, sending him flying back into one of his buddies. Xander bent down, and Buffy quickly and expertly, planted her feet on his shoulders.</P>
<p>He stood up. With one hand he tried to balance her, while in the other hold the branch.</P>
<p>"Lots of pain." He grunted. "Could you hurry up and jump?"</P>
<p>"Sorry. Just be glad I don’t wear heels."</P>
<p>She seemed to rocket herself off, of Xander, and grabbed a particularly thick branch. She was above the circle and saw Xander fighting his way through the crowd. She flung herself up onto the limb, and into a standing position.</P>
<p>She saw Willow, Cordelia, Oz and Giles. Willow had the gun. Trying to get Willow’s attention she whistled. Willow looked up, and nodded. She started to fire the gun, and burned several vampires fighting her way to get to Xander.</P>
<p>He was doing okay, but the branch had long since vanished, dusted along with a vampire. Giles had the crossbow, and with more strength then Buffy thought he had, tossed the crossbow up to her.</P>
<p>She loaded the crossbow with a stake she had tied in her hair, and was trying to look for a good place to fire. Willow was nearly running out of ammunition, and Cordelia and Oz were trying to get Xander out of harm’s way.</P>
<p>She knew she was taking a risk, but she fired at a vampire that had Xander by the shirt. The vampire’s back was to her, and she fired. With accurate aim, the stake entered the vampire, and stayed lodged there, while it turned to ash.</P>
<p>The vampires were now turning their attention to the tree she was in. It was good for the gang, but bad for her. They all got around the tree, and started to shake it. Buffy was trying to keep her balance, but between her weight and the crossbow, the branch broke underneath her, and she and the branch landed on top of two vampires.</P>
<p>She groaned in pain at the fall, as the other vampires started to come over to her. The gang came over, and Willow held up the gun.</P>
<p>"You want this?" She asked.</P>
<p>The vampires looked at Buffy and then at the gun, and decided to run off. Willow helped Buffy up.</P>
<p>"You weren’t falling for me just now, were you?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"It’s customary when someone falls from an extremely high height to be concerned for that person’s well being."</P>
<p>"Are you okay, Buffy?"</P>
<p>"I’ll probably have a bad back when I hit thirty, but yes I am, thank you. And in case you haven’t noticed, I fell for you a long time ago."</P>
<p>Willow grinned.</P>
<p>"How much water did you have left in that thing?" Cordelia asked.</P>
<p>"None. I was bluffing."</P>
<p>"Nice bluff." Buffy said walking towards Xander. "You okay?"</P>
<p>"For now. Pain comes later."</P>
<p>"Who let him barrel in like that?"</P>
<p>"No one." Oz said.</P>
<p>"We tried to –" Giles started.</P>
<p>"Stop him." Cordelia finished.</P>
<p>"But I’m the Xandinator. I cannot be stopped."</P>
<p>"Maybe not. But next time, a little suggestion?"  Buffy said.</P>
<p>"What?"</P>
<p>"Use a better joke." Buffy and Willow said together.</P>
<p>They looked at one another, and then at the stares of the rest of the gang.</P>
<p>"One word – Eerie." Oz said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Back at the library, Buffy had a heating pack pressed up against her back by Willow. Giles was reading, Cordelia was pressing a wet cloth on Xander’s forehead, and Oz was checking the lock on the book cage.</P>
<p>"Downside to being a wolf is definitely cages." Oz said. Tomorrow was the first night.</P>
<p>"Well, look at it this way. At least you’re not neutered." Xander said, as Oz just looked at him. "You’re not, are you?"</P>
<p>"Last time I checked, no."</P>
<p>"So you two know each other pretty well." Cordelia said, looking at Willow and Buffy.</P>
<p>"You could say that." Willow stuttered.</P>
<p>"And I was the last to know."</P>
<p>"Know what?" Giles asked without looking up from his book.</P>
<p>"Guess I’m not the last." Cordelia grinned, sensing a prime opportunity.</P>
<p>"Hey did any of you guys happen to see Faith as you were coming to get me?" Buffy asked, quickly redirecting the conversation.</P>
<p>"Yep." Willow responded eager to change topics as well. "We ran into each other."</P>
<p>"Like you just happened to –"</P>
<p>"She really ran, as in colliding, into her." Cordelia clarified.</P>
<p>"She just looked at me, then walked away. She looked sad." Willow said.</P>
<p>"I think we can help her." </P>
<p>"She’s a lost cause, Buffy." Xander said.</P>
<p>"She’s a confused cause. Giles what’s up with the Council and the Watcher?"</P>
<p>Giles looked up from the book he was reading.</P>
<p>"The Watcher is supposed to arrive very soon. Beyond that, the Council has told me nothing. Whatever they plan to do about Faith, or not do, I am not aware of." Giles said with a sad look.</P>
<p>Buffy gave him a reassuring smile. "You’ll always be my Watcher. I don’t want another one."</P>
<p>Giles smiled back in return. "Nevertheless, you must follow his rules. The Council has been very lenient with you Buffy. Mostly because I spoke on your behalf, but now that I am no longer influential, the slightest mistake on your part…"</P>
<p>"Will get me in trouble. I’m not so much worried about me as I am Faith. If they catch her, they’ll probably really punish her, right?"</P>
<p>"Most likely."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>At the airport, a young British man stepped out of the terminal. He went over to baggage claim. The first piece of luggage was a suitcase, which he got easily. He couldn’t find the second piece, which was a hardbound case.</P>
<p>He turned around, and saw a brown haired girl holding it in front of his face.</P>
<p>"Looking for this?"</P>
<p>"Yes, thank you."</P>
<p>She handed it over.</P>
<p>"Hey. You’re a Watcher, right?"</P>
<p>He was startled. "Who are you?"</P>
<p>"I think we’re in the same business. You got a name?"</P>
<p>"Wesley…Wesley Wyndam Pryce."</P>
<p>"A three name guy. You know I’ve heard rumors about guys with three names…I’d like to test them out."</P>
<p>He was flustered. "And you are?"</P>
<p>"Faith. We need to talk."</P>
<p>"About?"</P>
<p>"Buffy."</P>
<p>They walked out of the airport, Wesley hanging on her every word. </P>

<P>In City Hall, Trick walked into the Mayor’s office carrying two, very old-looking swords. Allan was in the room as well, watching nervously as the Mayor read the paper.</P>
<P>"Check these out." Trick said, laying the swords on the Mayor’s desk.</P>
<P>"I just love the Family Circus! That P.J., he's getting to be quite a handful." He said chuckling, and turning his attention to the swords. "Well...I haven't seen anything like this in… well, a good long while. Where's the owner of these fine implements?"</P>
<P>"The common term is 'slain'. Faith thought you might find these interesting. I've been seeing this breed around. Are we expecting any trouble?"</P>
<P>"Do you like Family Circus?"</P>
<P>"I like Marmaduke."</P>
<P>The Mayor was disgusted. "He's always on the furniture. Unsanitary."</P>
<P>"Nobody can tell Marmaduke what to do. That's my kinda dog."</P>
<P>"I like to read Cathy." Allan said, smiling. They gave him a look. "So…what about these swords? What should we do about that?"</P>
<P>"Well, let's just keep an eye out. We've got the dedication coming up in a few days. We certainly can't have anything interfering with that." The Mayor said.</P>
<P>"Well, maybe we should postpone the...dedication."</P>
<P>"I believe the Honorable Mayor hates that idea." Trick said.</P>
<P>"The dedication...is the final step before my Ascension. I have waited longer than you can imagine for this. After the Hundred Days, I'll be on a higher plane. And I'll have no more need for…well, let's just say I won't be concerned... with the little things.  </P>
<P>"Mr. Trick, watch these people. Anything you find out about them, well, lets just see that that information reaches our resident spunky do-gooder. Who knows? With any luck, they'll kill each other. Then everyone's a winner. Everyone, of course, meaning me." He chuckled.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>The gang was sitting in the lounge at school. Willow had several large envelopes around her. Buffy sat next to her, looking at them. </P>
<P>"Willow, what are these?" Xander asked.</P>
<P>"They're early admission packets."</P>
<P>"Harvard... Yale... Wesleyan... Some German Polytechnical Institute whose name…I can't pronounce. Is anyone else intimidated? 'Cause I'm just expecting thin slips of paper with the words 'No Way' written in crayon."</P>
<P>"They're typing those now." Oz said.</P>
<P>Xander nodded his understanding.</P>
<P>"I'm so overwhelmed! I got in! To actual colleges! And, and they're wooing me! They're pitching woo!" Willow said excitedly.</P>
<P>"The wooing stage is always fun." Buffy smiled, but there was sadness in her eyes.</P>
<P>"But it's weird. Now, rejection I can handle 'cause of the years of training, but this..."</P>
<P>"I feel your pain, Will. Like right now, I'm torn between the fast-growing fields of appliance repair and motel management. Of course, I'm still waiting to hear back from the Corndog Emporium, so..." Xander said.</P>
<P>"Well, I think it's great. Early admission. Now there's nothing standing between you and a brilliant future." Buffy said.</P>
<P>Willow looked at Buffy and squeezed her hand. The conversation occurring between them was quick, but a lot was said.</P>
<p><I>‘You can’t stay here because of me.’</P>
<P>‘I am. I’m just excited, but I’m not going anywhere.’</P>
<P>‘You have –’ </I> </P>
<P>The gang was watching them. Cordelia spoke up.</P>
<P>"Hello? You guys coming back from the Twilight Zone anytime soon?"</P>
<P>"Sorry." They both said.</P>
<P>"Well, if I may suggest, graduate. Gettin' left back, not the thrill ride you'd expect." Oz said.</P>
<P>"So, life beyond high school. Anyone, please... chime in." Xander said.</P>
<P>"I hear it's nice. And a place I'll never go if I don't pass Mrs. Taggart's chemistry test tomorrow." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"Oh! I can help. Chemistry's easy. It's a lot like witchcraft, only less newt. So whadaya say? Study jam, my house, tonight?" Willow asked.</P>
<P>"I'm there." The bell rang, and they all got ready to go to class. "Oh. I have to go see Giles, report on last night's patrol."</P>
<P>"Oh, yeah. He said he wanted to talk to you."</P>
<P>"What about? Is he okay?"</P>
<P>"He's looked better."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In the library, Wesley was speaking with Giles. Giles wasn’t having very much fun, and was watching the new man get books out of boxes he had shipped with him on the plane. </P>
<P>"Of course, training procedures have been updated quite a bit since your day. Much greater emphasis on field work." Wesley said.</P>
<P>"Really?"</P>
<P>"Oh, yes. Not all books and theory nowadays. I have, in fact, faced two vampires myself. Under controlled circumstances, of course."</P>
<P>"Well, no danger of finding those here."</P>
<P>"Vampires?"</P>
<P>"Controlled circumstances." Buffy came in. "Hello, Buffy."</P>
<P>"Well...Hello." Wesley said, cautiously.</P>
<P>"New Watcher?" Buffy asked, looking Wesley up and down.</P>
<P>Giles was about to respond, but Wesley interrupted him.</P>
<P>"Yes, I am. Normally, I would introduce myself, however, that is rather pointless."</P>
<P>"What are you talking about?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>Wesley whistled, and two well-built men came into the library.</P>
<P>"I would advise you not to fight. This will go easier for everyone, if you just go along with us."</P>
<P>"What is the meaning of this?" Giles asked, walking over to Buffy.</P>
<P>"It is my belief that Miss Summers is too far gone to respond to any kind of authority, and therefore must be removed from her duties as soon as possible. She will be taken to England, and the Council will past judgement."</P>
<P>"I will not stand for this!" Giles said, clearly enraged.</P>
<P>"You no longer have any say, Mr. Giles. The Council informed me of the way you have been corrupted. Sad, really."</P>
<P>"You don’t even know me. What about Faith?" Buffy said.</P>
<P>"I know enough. Faith will be dealt with, but you are priority. Gentlemen, we may have to restrain her."</P>
<P>The two men came over to her. One tried to cuff her, but of course, she fought him, elbowing him in the stomach. The man fell; however, the other man quickly stuck a needle in the only place he could reach.</P>
<P>Buffy immediately collapsed, unconscious.</P>
<P>"I have to escort her back to London. Can I trust, Mr. Giles, that you will keep an eye on my belongings?"</P>
<P>"I’ll keep an eye on them all right." Giles grabbed Wesley’s shirt and slammed him into the table. "Tell them to back off."</P>
<P>"Now…Mr. Giles you know I cannot do that. You know the Council’s decisions are final, and they trust my assessments. They have been rather kind to allow you to stay here, however, if you attack me, or interfere, they will not hesitate to deal with you."</P>
<P>Giles let him go.</P>
<P>"Pick her up. We must not waste any time." </P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In an armored truck, Buffy was sitting on a wooden bench in the back. Her arms were chained to it. Wesley and one of the men were sitting back there with her.</P>
<P>"You don’t know what you’re doing." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"Don’t I?"</P>
<P>"In case you haven’t noticed, I have done my job. You know, saved the world?"</P>
<P>"True, but if I’m correct that would not have been necessary if you had not gotten involved with Angelus. Mr. Giles should have forbade it from the start."</P>
<P>"Don’t bring Giles or Angel into this. I fixed my mistake."</P>
<P>"At the expense of a Slayer." Buffy looked down at her feet. "Surely you can see how the Council cannot accept this kind of recklessness."</P>
<P>"You wanna talk recklessness? Look up, Faith. The bad one. The one who joined up with the baddies in town."</P>
<P>Wesley’s face was expressionless.</P>
<p>"As I said before, Faith will be dealt with. If necessary."</P>
<p>"If necessary?"</P>
<p>The truck stopped. A few minutes later, the back door opened. The driver was standing there.</P>
<p>"Cop."</P>
<p>"Ah, I see. I’ll handle it. Watch her."</P>
<p>Wesley exited the truck, and the driver came inside. </P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Up ahead of the truck some fifty feet, was a cop standing out in front of his car. Faith waited until Wesley’s attention was diverted completely to the cop, and ran over to the back of the truck. She rushed inside, and quickly kicked the two men directly in their heads, with enough force that they slumped, unconscious to the floor.</P>
<p>She looked at Buffy on the bench.</P>
<p>"Getting kinky with two guys and chains, B? Never knew you had it in you."</P>
<p>"What are you doing here?"</P>
<p>"Don’t worry. The cops will keep the Brit busy."</P>
<p>"You did this?"</P>
<p>"I can do a lot more. Frankly, I thought that since I was coming to rescue you, you’d be more grateful."</P>
<p>"And why would you do that?"</P>
<p>"Open your eyes, B. The company you work for is about to ship you three thousand miles away because you didn’t save the world the right way. You bust your ass, and instead of getting thanks, you get chained."</P>
<p>"I’ll go, the Council will let me go when they find out I haven’t done anything wrong…"</P>
<p>"Really? I talked to this guy. He came here to do this to you, and I’m next. They aren’t gonna give you a fair trial, they’re going to get rid of you."</P>
<p>"Why didn’t he take you when you talked to him?"</P>
<p>"I…convinced him to hold off on me."</P>
<p>"Convinced being?"</P>
<p>"You really wanna know?"</P>
<p>"Forget it."</P>
<p>"We have to stick together on this. He doesn’t give a damn about you, and definitely doesn’t give a damn about me. Screw him and the rules. We were built to search and destroy, and if I had my way, I’d off the guy myself."</P>
<p>"But…"</P>
<p>"When are you gonna learn? Slayers are just on one huge assembly line. We’re just things. You don’t get any rights. Once you realize that you enjoy fighting and slaying, and that you don’t have to treat it like a job that holds you back, it’ll be a whole lot more fun.  Live a little, B. Worry about yourself for once. Coming?"</P>
<p>Buffy, easily broke the restraints on the bench, and stood up. Faith looked out.</P>
<p>"Damn! He’s coming back."</P>
<p>"Go. I’ll be fine."</P>
<p>They looked at each other, jumped out of the truck, and ran in opposite directions.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>The gang was sitting in the library. All their faces were sunken. Buffy was gone, on her way to England. Giles was pacing and cursing quietly to himself. Willow was standing by the double doors, praying for Buffy to come walking through them.</P>
<p>"Giles why didn’t you –" Willow started to say.</P>
<p>"He would have been taken away too, if he had attacked this new guy." Oz said.</P>
<p>"Then we’d be stuck here, and wait to die." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>"As much as I think the guy who took her should be beaten senseless, they’re right, Will." Xander said.</P>
<p>Willow sighed.</P>
<p>"I’m sorry. I just…"</P>
<p>"I understand, Willow. I wish I could have done more." Giles said.</P>
<p>Buffy came through the library doors, smiling.</P>
<p>"What’s with the gloom?" She asked.</P>
<p>Willow went wide-eyed for a minute, and crushed Buffy in hug.</P>
<p>"We…I…you’re…" Willow couldn’t find words.</P>
<p>She, without even realizing what she was doing, kissed Buffy long, and softly. Buffy was somewhat dazed when they broke apart.</P>
<p>"Did I just…"</P>
<p>"Yeah. You did."  Buffy had a happy grin on her face.</P>
<p>The gang was slack-jawed, and Giles just watched calmly from the counter. If he was surprised, he didn’t show it.</P>
<p>"Wow." Cordelia said. "I’ve never seen anybody –" </P>
<p>"Somebody rate that." Xander said.</P>
<P>"10." Oz said.</P>
<p>"Uh, guys? I think…" Buffy started, looking at Willow’s beet red face. They had never kissed in front of their friends before. </P>
<p>"Sorry, Will. Um, so anyway, we all thought you were on the plane to the mother country by now." Xander said, obviously still blown away by the sheer love that was behind the kiss.</P>
<p>"Do you really think I’d let my friends," She looked Willow directly in the eye, "be defenseless, and alone?"</P>
<p>"How did you –" Giles started.</P>
<p>"His measures of security weren’t that tight."</P>
<p>"You just escaped?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"Buffy, that was not –"</P>
<p>"Oh, come on Giles. You know they’re wrong. Forget them. You are the only one I ever listened to, and it’s gonna stay that way. He tries to take me to England to kill me, and I’m supposed to stand for that?"</P>
<p>There were shocked looks all around.</P>
<p>"Where did you learn this?" Giles asked.</P>
<p>Just then, Wesley came through the doors. Buffy whirled around, and grabbed him by the neck.</P>
<p>"Oh look, I caught a murderer. Oz can you open the cage, please?"</P>
<p>Oz quickly swung open the book cage, and Buffy tossed Wesley inside. She shut and locked the door. Wesley was choking.</P>
<p>"How…did you…"</P>
<p>"Giles what’s his name?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"Wesley."</P>
<p>"Well, Wesley, your Council seems to underestimate their employees. You’re going to stay in there for awhile."</P>
<p>"You’re in more trouble then you realize."</P>
<p>"Me? I could have you arrested. You were bringing me to your bosses to kill me, right? How were you gonna do it, cause I’d like to see how you’d react. Was it going to be slow or fast? Just be glad I’m feeling a bit more chipper right now."</P>
<p>Wesley was silent. Giles walked up to the cage, shades of ‘Ripper’ in his eyes.</P>
<p>"Be glad there’s a cage between us. I wouldn’t be as merciful, believe me."</P>
<p>Even though everyone agreed with Buffy’s course of action and thought that Wesley deserved a lot more then he was receiving; they couldn’t help but notice a change in Buffy. This was unlike her.</P>
<p>"Now, should we be doing something?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>Willow looked at Buffy, wanting to talk. Buffy told her ‘not now’ and looked up like she remembered something.</P>
<p>"I wanted to tell you about patrol last night. I found some swords on the ground. They weren’t the same size, and they had jewels and stuff."</P>
<p>"Hmm…El Eliminati. Fifteenth Century..." Giles said remembering.</P>
<P>"Fifteenth Century duelist cult, deadly in their day. Their numbers dwindled in later centuries due to an increase in  anti-vampire activity and a lot of pointless dueling." Wesley said from inside the cage.</P>
<p>"For someone caged, you sure do have a lot to say." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"He may be of help, Buffy."</P>
<p>Buffy huffed, and threw up her arms. "Fine. Speak."</P>
<P>"They eventually became the acolytes of a demon called Balthazar, who brought them to the New World, specifically here."</P>
<P>"So why have we not seen them before this?"</P>
<P>"They were driven out a hundred years ago. Happily, Balthazar was killed. I don't know by whom."</P>
<p>"So is this their five-hundred year reunion party?" Xander asked.</P>
<P>"Balthazar had an amulet purported to give him strength. It was buried with him, and I believe the few remaining Eliminati are probably looking for it. For sentimental value."</P>
<p>"Sentimental value?" Will ow asked.</P>
<p>"Since when are vampires sentimental?" Cordelia asked.</P>
<p>"I hear they get all teared up on Anne Rice’s birthday." Oz said.</P>
<p>"I should go look for it." Buffy said, getting up.</P>
<p>Willow got up too, and followed her outside the library. Giles opened the cage, and walked inside.</P>
<p>"What are you going to do?" Wesley asked, frightened.</P>
<p>Giles started gathering up all the weapons hanging up inside.</P>
<p>"I can’t very well let you have access to deadly weaponry, now can I?"</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Buffy, are you  okay?" Willow asked out in the hall.</P>
<p>"Fine. Why wouldn’t I be?"</P>
<p>"I don’t know…you just…it’s nothing."</P>
<p>"Then I’ll see you tomorrow okay?"</P>
<p>"Tonight, Buffy."</P>
<p>"Huh?"</P>
<p>"Chemistry test? Study jam?"</P>
<p>"Oh yeah, I’ll be there."</P>
<p>Buffy walked away, leaving Willow worried.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Later that night, Buffy was searching a crypt in the graveyard. The large room was dark and dusty. In the center were two stone coffins. There were several drawers on one wall and a few urns on shelves. Buffy took the steps down into the room and went to the first coffin. She pushed the heavy lid aside and looked into it with the flashlight she was carrying. All that was left of the body was the skeleton and a pile of hair and fibers.</P>
<P>"Strike one. No amulet there."</P>
<P>She went to the next coffin and pushed its lid aside. The body inside was dried out, but the amulet hung around its neck. </P>
<P>"Game over."</P>
<P>She reached in for it, but jerked back up when she heard noises coming from outside. Through the door she saw torches coming closer and voices. She quickly jumped up onto the first coffin, rolled into it and twisted off her flashlight just as Vincent, the leader of the Eliminati, pushed the door open. He looked around, but didn’t notice when Buffy pulled the lid of the coffin back into place. Vincent walked down the stairs and went over to the open coffin. His men followed him. </P>
<P>Vincent looked into the open coffin, saw the amulet and took it out. The Eliminati started to make their way out. When Buffy heard the door close she pushed the lid back open and climbed out, only to be startled by Faith's hand on her shoulder.</P>
<P>"Faith!"</P>
<P>"What are you doing, hiding in there?"</P>
<P>"Looking for something. Wasn't counting on the Special Guest Stars. Six against one. Hence the hiding."</P>
<P>"Well, it's six against two now, so come on."</P>
<P>She rushed out of the crypt. Buffy climbed out of the coffin and followed her out. They came out in time to see the last two Eliminati jump down through a manhole into the sewers. Faith made her way toward it.</P>
<P>"Wait. Stop." Faith stopped reluctantly. "What’s going on here?"</P>
<P>"You’re looking for the amulet, right?"</P>
<p>"How’d you know?"</P>
<p>"Boss is looking for it too. He wants those guys floating in the wind."</P>
<p>"Aren’t you supposed to be friends with vampires?"</P>
<p>"Not these."</P>
<p>They started toward the manhole again.</P>
<p>"Why am I not attacking you? You’re…"</P>
<p>"Living life on my own terms. Like you should. Besides, you have to slay, it’s your job, and I saved your life, remember? So let’s go."</P>
<p>"It's a manhole. Tight space, no escape, six against two, not unlike three against one."</P>
<P>"And there might be more," She grabbed Buffy’s arm, "so come on." </P>
<P>"You're just gonna go down there? That's your plan?"</P>
<P>"Who said I had a plan? I don't know how many’s down there, but I wanna find out. And I'll know when I land. If you don't come in after me, I might die! You wouldn’t want that on your perfect ‘do the right thing’ conscious, would you?"</P>
<P>Faith jumped in, and Buffy soon followed.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy and Faith ended up having their hands full fighting the Eliminati. Buffy did a low front snap kick to one of them on the ground. Faith backhand punched another, and his head snapped hard to the side. Buffy grabbed yet another and shoved him aside.</P>
<P>"We're surrounded!" She yelled.</P>
<P>"You noticed that, too?"</P>
<P>Faith backhand punched another one. Buffy ducked a vampire's swing and did a roundhouse kick to the back of his knee, making him collapse to the floor. Faith sidestepped her attacker, grabbed his arm, swung him around and threw him toward a wall. Buffy did a full spinning hook kick to an incoming vampire and followed up with a roundhouse kick to his head. </P>
<P>Another one came at her from the side and tried to bring his sword down on her from above, but she stepped back in time, and it clanged on the floor. Faith threw her vampire up against a wall, and he collapsed. She did a half-spinning hook kick to another one behind her, and he fell dazed onto a raised area. Another vampire jumped up onto it and leapt at Faith. She sidestepped him and pulled him down over the other one.</P>
<P>Buffy did a back elbow jab at a vampire's face, causing him to step backwards and trip over a fallen vampire. Another one jumped in and tried to punch her, but she blocked him, grabbed onto his arm and threw him up against the rock wall. He tried to come at her again, but she side kicked him in the gut, forcing him back up against the wall. </P>
<P>The Eliminatus who was down got up again, and she front kicked him, knocking him hard onto his back. Faith turned around just in time to get punched in the face by Vincent. He tried to punch her again, but she ducked it and rose back up to roundhouse kick him in the side of the head. Buffy blocked two punches from the vampire against the wall and punched him in the face and again in the gut. He went down.</P>
<P>Faith did a half spinning, jumping kick to the head of one of them. Then she high blocked a punch from one behind her. Buffy got a roundhouse kick in the head and fell to the ground by a pool of water. Her attacker advanced on her, and she roundhouse kicked him in the back of the knee, making him lose his balance.</P>
<P>Faith punched one in the head, but he came back with a punch to Faith's gut and grabbed her.</P>
<P>"Lemme go!"</P>
<P>He shoved her hard against a concrete wall. Buffy saw Faith and threw her stake into the vampire's back as she got up from the floor. He burst into ashes. Faith gave Buffy a smile. However, with her attention on Faith, Buffy didn't notice the one behind her, and he grabbed her and held her still for Vincent. He held out his long sword, pointing it at her chest.</P>
<P>"Let's settle this honorably." Vincent said.</P>
<P>Buffy jumped up against the one holding her and did a kick, knocking the sword out of Vincent's hand. It went flying into the pool of water. Then she shrugged off the one holding her, and he fell to the floor. </P>
<P>Vincent grabbed hold of her though, and tried to thrust at her with his short sword. She jerked out of the way in time and grabbed hold of his arm, but he used this to his advantage and grabbed her around the back with his other arm, pinning her against the edge of the pool.</P>
<P>"Well, then, let's just settle it."</P>
<P>He dunked her head into the water. She struggled to get back up, but couldn’t get a grip on anything. In the meantime, another vampire got Faith in a full Nelson hold. She saw Buffy struggling in the water.</P>
<P>"Buffy!" She yelled over to Vincent. "You son of a bitch!"</P>
<p>Faith knew she could let Buffy die, and that would solve a lot of problems. The boss would be happy, and he wouldn’t have anything to worry about. She would eventually get out of here, anyway. But she didn’t want that.</P>
<p>Buffy had gotten to her. She wanted Buffy on her side. She wanted to fight along side her. Two Chosen Ones on their own. Buffy understood her, and if she was completely honest with herself, she knew she had no one to lean on. She knew she’d never be able to go back to the "good side" so she had to bring Buffy over. She didn’t want her to die.</P>
<P>Vincent kept holding Buffy's head under water. She struggled valiantly to get up, but couldn't. She started to get weak from lack of oxygen and stopped struggling, apparently passing out. He held her under for another few seconds, then let go and turned his attention to Faith. Buffy remained motionless in the water. Vincent grinned at Faith, who kept struggling.</P>
<P>Suddenly Buffy leapt up, Vincent's long sword in hand, and swung it around at his head. He was too quick, though, and ducked it, but was left off balance in a crouch.</P>
<P>"I hate it when they drown me."</P>
<P>She swung at him again, but he reacted instantly, somersaulting out of the way and back to his feet. He faced her wielding his short sword. She made quick work of it, knocking it out of his hand with her first swing. She swung at him again widely, but he managed to dodge her.</P>
<P>Faith broke out of the hold, spun around and punched the vampire in the face. He staggered against the wall. She grabbed him and pulled him around, and he flew up and over the small raised area. She smiled at Buffy in admiration.</P>
<P>"B! Gotta go!" </P>
<P>Buffy missed another swing, but had a determined look on her face.</P>
<P>"We came for the amulet."</P>
<P>She jabbed the sword straight at Vincent, getting the tip right between the chain holding the amulet at his waist. She lifted the sword, drawing the chain out from under his belt, and it slid down the length of the blade to the hilt. Vincent left immediately. Buffy pulled the amulet from the sword and held it in her hand. Faith came up next to her.</P>
<P>"Tell me you don't get off on this!" Faith said.</P>
<P>"It didn't suck."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>It was late night at the library. Everyone had left, and Wesley was still locked in the book cage. Faith came strolling in.</P>
<p>"She locked you up, Wes?"</P>
<p>"Apparently."</P>
<p>"My girl’s really coming around."</P>
<p>"What are you talking about?"</P>
<p>"Newsflash, you’re a fool. How’d they ever let you pass? I’m the bad seed."</P>
<p>Wesley looked horrified.</P>
<p>"I was the first one to use you? You don’t know how happy that makes me."</P>
<p>"Why?"</P>
<p>"Congratulations. You helped me to start to swing Buffy over to my side. Thanks. Oh, and enjoy imprisonment, asshole." </P>
<p>Faith left the library, smiling.</P>

<p>The demon, Balthazar, was extremely overweight, with very pale, slimy skin. He sat in a tank of dirty water, while one of the Eliminati poured some of the water over him trying to keep his skin moist. </P>
<P>&quot;Let me tell you what I see.&quot; He told his followers. &quot;I see fear... and remorse... and the pitiful look of faces that cry out for mercy! But what I don't see is what I want to see, and that's... my... amulet!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Lord Balthazar, we found it! We had it! But the Slayers...&quot; Said a vampire.</P>
<P>&quot;Already I'm bored.&quot;</P>
<P>He held out his hands, and instantly a sort of ‘magnet effect’ was distorting the air. The vampire floated over to Balthazar, who grabbed his throat and squeezed until his neck broke and he slumped to the floor. Vincent watched, extremely worried.</P>
<P>&quot;Vincent... Come here.&quot; He wheezed as Vincent approached. &quot;Closer.&quot;</P>
<P>Vincent leaned toward him. &quot;Closer.&quot; </P>
<P>He leaned even closer, and Balthazar put his hands on Vincent's shoulders. </P>
<P>&quot;Let me tell you… what I want to see.&quot;</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In the library, Giles was studying the amulet Buffy had given him when she came to school. Wesley was sitting in the cage, quiet. Then, with a look of apology on his face, he stood up, and addressed Giles.</P>
<p>&quot;There’s something I must tell you.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;I have plenty information on the amulet, thank you.&quot; Giles responded curtly.</P>
<p>&quot;It’s not about that…&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;Go on.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;It seems I have made a miscalculation.&quot;</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In chemistry class, Mrs. Taggart passed out the exam booklets. Buffy was sitting next to Willow at their table by the window. She was twisted around in her seat talking quietly to Willow, Xander, and Cordelia. </P>
<P>&quot;It was intense. It was like I just... let go and became this force. I just didn't care anymore.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah, I know what that's like.&quot; Willow responded.</P>
<P>&quot;I don't think you can. It's kind of a Slayer thing. I don't even think I'm explaining it well.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You're explaining it a lot, though.&quot; Xander said.</P>
<P>&quot;Did something happen during patrol last night?&quot; Willow asked.</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing out of the usual. Why?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You’ve never seemed to enjoy slaying this much before.&quot;</P>
<P>Mrs. Taggart handed the four of them their tests.  &quot;Alright. You have one period to fill out your test booklets. Periodic charts are located on the back. You're on the honor system, so remember, no talking.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy started talking again. &quot;You see, the thing was –&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ahem. Ms. Summers?&quot; Mrs. Taggert said. &quot;You have one hour.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy turned to her test, and as soon as the teacher had her back turned, she talked again. &quot;Okay, so the best part...&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Buffy. Test? You know. Remember? The thing you didn't come over to study for?&quot; Willow explained, worry and hurt in her voice.</P>
<P>&quot;Right. Got it.&quot; She went back to her test, but then began again. &quot;Sorry. Okay, so we're down there, in the sewers…I mean, me…and…&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;God, Buffy shut up.&quot; Cordelia hissed.</P>
<P>Buffy realized that she wasn’t going to be allowed to continue her story, and calmed down to take her test. She opened the booklet, but was interrupted, along with the rest of the class, by Faith rapping on the windowpane trying to get Buffy's attention. Faith lifted the sash and leaned in.</P>
<P>&quot;Hey. Bad time?&quot; Faith asked.</P>
<P>She leaned over to the next window, wiped the dust from it with her sleeve, exhaled to fog it and used her index fingers to draw a heart with a stake through it. She looked at Buffy, smiled and raised her eyebrows. Buffy slid down from her lab stool and headed for the window. </P>
<P>&quot;No, she can't! You can't! Can you?&quot; Willow asked, not believing what was happening.</P>
<P>Buffy regarded her for a moment, and climbed out of the window. Faith lowered the sash. </P>
<P>&quot;What's up?&quot; Buffy asked. They were walking outside now.</P>
<P>&quot;Vampires.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Uh, Faith, unless there's a total eclipse in the next five minutes, its daylight.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good for us, bad for them. Found a nest. Don’t know if it’s our boys, but they’re still vampires.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Has potential.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;How is everyone?&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;You mean you care?&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;Not really, but…&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;Willow’s all excited about getting accepted to every college on the planet. She’s probably gonna…&quot; Buffy looked sad for a second, and then shrugged it off. &quot;Forget it. Where’s the nest?&quot;</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In the nest, it was dark and musty. Only a few rays of sunlight were getting in. There were vampires lying all over the floor. Buffy and Faith kicked in the door, and the sunlight poured in. It hit one of the vampires, and it quickly burst into flames. They all scrambled to their feet and began to run. </P>
<P>&quot;Rise and shine, people.&quot; Faith said.</P>
<P>&quot;It's your wake-up call.&quot; Buffy said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>In City Hall, the Mayor posed with a troop of Boy Scouts. They all had smiles on their faces. The photographer snapped the picture.</P>
<P>&quot;There we go.&quot; He said, as the boys went out of the office. &quot;Thanks a lot, fellas. Thanks a heap.&quot;</P>
<P>He went to the window, where the blinds were open, and started to shut them.</P>
<P>&quot;Hey, have fun on that camping trip, now. Don't forget to roast a wiener for me.&quot;</P>
<p>As the last kid left, the Mayor walked to the door of his private bathroom.</P>
<P>&quot;Here we go. Alright, you can come out now.&quot;  Mr. Trick came into the office. &quot;Backbone of America, those little guys. Seeing the hope and courage on their bright little faces, I swear I could just, I... I could just eat 'em up.&quot; </P>
<P>He walked over to the liquor cabinet, and started to open it up. &quot;So, any news about the Eliminati?&quot;</P>
<P>Vincent jumped out and grabbed him by the neck, pushing him back and down over his desk and held up his sword to attack.</P>
<P>&quot;In the name of Lord Balthazar, die!&quot;</P>
<P>Before he could do anything, Mr. Trick punched him in the forehead. Vincent fell backward onto the floor, unconscious. The Mayor coughed as he sat up on the edge of the desk and straightened his tie.</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you, Mr. Trick. That was very thoughtful of you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why do they always gotta be using swords? It's called an Uzi, chump! Could have saved your ass right about now.&quot; Trick said to Vincent’s still form.</P>
<P>&quot;You know, it's curious how he could've gotten all the way into my liquor cabinet.&quot; The Mayor looked at Allan who was standing in the corner. &quot;Allan, don't we have security working in this building?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sir, I... I had no idea. I...&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There's no need to swoon, Allan. But try to keep things secure. Lock him up.&quot; The Mayor looked at Vincent. </P>
<P>&quot;He wakes up, he's just gonna try and kill you again.&quot; Trick said.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I expect he will.&quot;</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>In the library, Wesley was now telling everyone, except Buffy, about his ‘miscalculation’.</P>
<P>&quot;Her story seemed to fit with what I’d been told about…all of you…she was quite inviting…&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The Council didn’t tell you that Faith was the bad one?&quot; Willow asked.</P>
<P>&quot;Faith has…&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Been informally discharged, in the mildest sense. Am I correct?&quot; Giles asked.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes. To be quite frank, the Council did not take your warnings about Faith at face value. Nor did I, when I was told.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You thought he was making it up?&quot; Xander asked.</P>
<P>&quot;It doesn’t matter now. What matters is…&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That you let Faith trick Buffy, and now…&quot; Willow trailed off.</P>
<P>&quot;Who knows what ideas she’s been planting in her head.&quot; Giles said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Later, at night, Buffy and Willow were sitting on Buffy’s bed. Willow handed her a small black pouch, and she smelled its contents.</P>
<P>&quot;You like it?&quot; Willow asked.</P>
<P>&quot;It smells good. What is it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Just a little something we witches like to call a protection spell.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good deal, protection. I'm surprised, though, 'cause usually spell stuff's more...&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Stinky. Yeah. That's why I added lavender. Give me time, and I may be the first wicca to do all my conjuring in pine fresh scent. So what's the plan?&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy gave her a questioning look.</P>
<P>&quot;For tonight's slayage. We're going, aren't we?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah.&quot; Buffy looked down at the bag, trying to see if she could see the individual fibers. Avoiding wasn’t her best talent.</P>
<p>&quot;Out with it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But... there's a 'but'. And that's 'but you shouldn't come... tonight.' Is that cool?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, sure. Makes sense. You know... You'll be facing big, hairy danger.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Uh, biggest and very hairy. Found the Elimanti’s place. Wouldn’t want you to get hurt…or anything…&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You'll be risking your life.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Right. And why risk yours?&quot;</P>
<P>Willow glanced down at the bed. &quot;Because I'm your friend?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because I love you, and that's exactly why I don't want you going. It's too dangerous.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But I've done this sort of thing before! Like, a million times, and I can totally handle myself. Besides, minty fresh protection. So?&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;It’s…&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;It’s Faith. I know who it is. You’re just trying to hide that’s who you’re slaying with. The enemy.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;She’s not…I just think maybe if I hang with her…she’ll come back to the side of good. She just needs someone to push her in the right direction.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;She’s the one doing the pushing, Buffy. Wesley said…&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;Wesley? The guy who tried to cart me off to England and kill me Wesley?&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;Faith set him up. She tricked him, and…now she’s tricking you.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;She saved me. Don’t you trust me?&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;Always, you just haven’t been yourself, and Faith seems to be in the middle of it all.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;She isn’t doing anything to me. Look, I have to go.&quot; Buffy walked out of the room, angry.</P>
<p>Willow looked out Buffy’s window, and saw Faith standing on the sidewalk.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Inside Balthazar’s warehouse, a vampire was pouring more water on his boss.</P>
<P>&quot;Vincent made a noble effort. Man to man, as befits a true warrior. He had courage... He had honor... and I have jack to show for it! </P>
<P>&quot;It’s been a hundred years since my enemy crippled me. Now ultimate power is within his grasp. And I shall not let it be! Forget about honor! Forget about everything! But getting my amulet! Bring the Watchers to me! Find the Slayers and kill them! Kill everything that gets in your way! Go! Go!&quot;</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Faith and Buffy looked for the warehouse and found it. They looked in through a crack in the door and saw Balthazar surrounded by the Eliminati. His men started exiting.</P>
<p>Buffy and Faith stood flat against the wall, making sure they weren’t seen.</P>
<P>&quot;Okay, we got ten, maybe twelve bad guys and one big demon in desperate need of a Stairmaster.&quot; Buffy said.</P>
<P>&quot;I say we take 'em all, hard and fast and now.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We need a little more firepower than none. I should…&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I guess Jacuzzi Boy isn't going anywhere. I just... wish we had...&quot;</P>
<P>Faith spotted a sport and tackle shop across the street. She pointed Buffy in that direction.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah. That is too good.&quot; She said, heading for the store. Buffy was following.</P>
<P>The got to the front door and Faith kicked it in. They walked through quickly, looking for anything useful. Faith found the Archery counter.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah. Score.&quot;</P>
<P>She saw a small crossbow, complete with 4x optical sights, on display beneath the glass countertop. She broke the glass with her elbow, reached in, and pulled it out.</P>
<P>&quot;Think they're insured?&quot; Buffy asked.</P>
<P>&quot;Strangely, not my priority. When are ya gonna get this, B? Life for a Slayer is very simple.&quot; She walked to a case, broke it, and pulled out a pair of nun-chucks. &quot;Want...take…have.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy hesitated, but saw hunting knives in another case. </P>
<P>&quot;Want...take...have.&quot; Buffy repeated. She punched the glass with her fist, and grabbed a dagger out of the case. &quot;I'm gettin' it.&quot;</P>
<P>Faith smiled, seeing that Buffy was finally coming around. Before they could get any further, they were surprised by a gunshot. They spun around to see two police officers. They both had service revolvers aimed at them.</P>
<p>&quot;Drop the weapons and get down on the ground! Now!&quot; One officer said.</P>
<p>They didn’t move.</P>
<P>&quot;I said drop the weapons, or I fire.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy slowly reached her hand out and set the dagger on a counter. The officer was satisfied, and turned his attention to Faith. She gave in, and tossed the bow aside. </P>
<p>&quot;Your boss is gonna be very upset when he hears about this.&quot; Faith said.</P>
<P>&quot;Spread 'em.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You wish.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hands in the air where I can see 'em. Slow!&quot; The officer was worried about what Faith might do.</P>
<P>She smiled at him, but did as she was told and raised her arms over her head. Buffy raised hers as well, but up to her shoulders.</P>
<P>&quot;Good. Now cuff 'em.&quot;</P>
<P>His partner holstered his gun and reached into his belt for his cuffs. </P>
<P>&quot;I like him. He's butch.&quot; Faith said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Giles and Wesley were in his office. Wesley was checking out some of the pictures on the wall, while he was sitting at his desk.</P>
<P>&quot;I didn't say you had emotional problems. I said you had an emotional problem. It's quite different.&quot; Wesley said.</P>
<P>&quot;My 'attachment' to the Slayer is not a problem. In point of fact, it's been a very...&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The way you've handled this assignment is something of an embarrassment to the Council.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If you want to criticize my methods, fine. And then I can criticize yours.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The situation with Buffy was not my doing. It has probably been building towards this for quite some time. I’m surprised you were able to maintain some semblance of control on her for this long.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;First of all, it is entirely your fault. Buffy, to her credit, is a very emotionally driven person. A quality not usually found in Slayers. Most times her personality is an asset, but in this case, it has gotten her lost. </P>
<p>&quot;She cares about people, and that coupled with the strong bond between Slayers, well, it must be very painful for her to watch Faith go down the path she’s on. She obviously feels it is up to her to try and restore Faith, and yet Faith is destroying her. If you had actually thought through your actions, and not tried to take her away, this would not have happened.</P>
<p>&quot;She is your Slayer, and you are her Watcher now. Instead of bickering with me, maybe you should try and help me figure out how to handle this before she is too far gone.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;This matter will be cleared up in time. My point is, you're no longer qualified to act as Watcher.  It's not your fault. You've done well. It's simply time for somebody else to take the field.&quot; </P>
<P>Giles looked at him, then past him through the window to the main area.</P>
<P>&quot;Now's a good time to start.&quot;</P>
<P>Wesley turned to look as well, and they saw four Eliminati come to take them to Balthazar.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>In the police car, Buffy and Faith were in the back seat with their hands cuffed behind their backs. A heavy steel mesh separated them from the officers in the front seat.</P>
<P>&quot;That's some artillery you two were puttin' together. You with one of them girl gangs?&quot; One of the officers asked.</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah. We're the Slayers.&quot; The officer laughed. &quot;You wanna get outta here?&quot; She said quietly to Buffy.</P>
<P>She slouched down in the seat. Buffy realized what she intended to do, and was unsure.</P>
<P>&quot;Can't save the world in jail.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy realized she was right and slowly slouched down also. Faith raised her legs, and Buffy followed her lead.</P>
<P>&quot;One, two...&quot;</P>
<P>They both kicked hard into the steel mesh, making it buckle and tear at the edges and hit the officers in the backs of their heads. The driver lost control of the car, and it swerved, screeching to the left and smashed into a parked car. The radiator burst, and steam rose into the air. The officers were unconscious. </P>
<P>Buffy climbed out of the front passenger-side door. A moment later Faith came out too, with one of the officer's keys. They turned back-to-back and fumbled with the keys, trying to unlock the cuffs.</P>
<p>&quot;We should call an ambulance.&quot; Buffy said.</P>
<P>&quot;Five people already have, the racket we made, and they're fine.&quot; She got the cuffs unlocked. &quot;Come on. Let's get outta here. We’re not finished.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy didn't follow.</P>
<P>&quot;Come on!&quot;</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy went back to the warehouse, and waited in the alley for Faith. Faith had gone off, and said she’d be back. Buffy looked in. Giles was there, and Wesley. She jumped as she heard a police siren. The car continued down the street.</P>
<p>&quot;Looky what I got.&quot; Faith said walking up carrying the bow from the store.</P>
<p>&quot;I can’t believe you went back there.&quot;</P>
<p>Faith was going to say something, but an Eliminatus jumped down from above them.</P>
<p>&quot;Giles and Wesley are in there!&quot; Buffy yelled.</P>
<p>&quot;Well you aren’t going to be much help to them if you’re dead, so fight!&quot;</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Inside the warehouse, Giles and Wesley were watching Balthazar get ‘rejuvenated’.</P>
<p>&quot;The front! The front! Moisten the front!&quot;</P>
<P>He groaned as the water was poured across his chest. Wesley and Giles watched in disgust.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, God! Oh, God!&quot; Wesley panicked.</P>
<P>&quot;It doesn't seem too promising, does it?&quot; Giles asked calmly.</P>
<P>&quot;Stay calm, Mr. Giles. We have to stay calm.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, thank God you're here. I was planning to panic.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What is that thing?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That would be your demon. You know, the dead one?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There's no need to get snippy.&quot;</P>
<P>Balthazar looked at the two Watchers. &quot;Bring them closer.&quot;</P>
<P>They were shoved closer.</P>
<P>&quot;You know what I want.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If it's for me to scrub those hard-to-reach areas, I'd like to request you kill me now.&quot; Giles said. He was hit in the back of the head. &quot;Ow.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are you out of your mind? This is hardly the time for games!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why not? They're going to torture us to death anyway.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You're not wrong about that.&quot; Balthazar snickered.</P>
<P>&quot;Now, hold on. We can deal with this rationally. We have something you want. You have something we want.&quot; Wesley was caving.</P>
<P>&quot;Hmm. A trade. Intriguing. No. Wait. Boring. Pull off his kneecaps!&quot;</P>
<P>Two vampires grabbed Wesley.</P>
<P>&quot;No, no, no! It’s in our office at the school. I can get it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Quiet, you twerp! They'll kill us both.&quot; Giles said.</P>
<P>&quot;But I'd like to have my kneecaps.&quot;</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Out in the alley, the vampire roared and came at Buffy. She sidestepped him, grabbed, and shoved him into the back of a truck. He came at her again and did a front snap kick at her, but she blocked. She returned with a roundhouse kick to his gut, knocking him to the pavement. Buffy jumped on him, and they began to struggle. Another vampire joined in as Faith struggled with her bow.</P>
<P>&quot;Screw it!&quot; Faith said to herself.</P>
<P>She dropped the bow, but held onto the arrow. She ducked a roundhouse kick from the demon, and did a kick to his side, and he staggered into the side of a truck. Faith came at him with her arrow and plunged it home as he turned around to attack again. He burst into ashes. Buffy got up holding her stake, having just dusted hers as well.</P>
<P>&quot;I think we've got more comin'!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We're never gonna make it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If they keep coming one at a time, we got a shot.&quot;</P>
<P>Suddenly another Eliminatus landed in front of them and thrust at Faith with his short sword. She reacted instantly, catching his arm and shoving him into a crate, then pulling him off and swinging him backward onto a pile of several chords of wood. Buffy stepped right in and staked him. He crumbled to ash. They continued down the alley.</P>
<P>At the end of the building an arm reached out and grabbed Buffy by the shoulder. Instantly she grabbed the man and threw him against a dumpster. Faith jumped right in to stake him. He slumped down to the ground, hurt by the impact against the heavy steel container. It was Allan, but Faith was too caught up in things and to realize who he was.</P>
<P>&quot;Faith, no!&quot;</P>
<P>Faith swung down with her stake and plunged it into Allan's heart, then pulled it out. Allan grabbed his chest. Blood poured out. Faith backed away as Buffy quickly got down beside him to try to help him. Allan pulled his hands away and looked down at them covered in his own blood, shaking hard as he went into shock. Buffy looked at the wound and saw it was bad.</P>
<p>&quot;Don't move!&quot; Buffy said to him.</P>
<P>&quot;I didn't... I didn't know. I didn't know.&quot; Faith said in shock.</P>
<P>She was overwhelmed. Trying her best to rationalize her fear, and what had just happened, she thought, <I>‘The bastard was probably gonna squeal anyway.’  </I>Not surprisingly, it didn’t help her.</P>
<P>&quot;We need to call 911, now!&quot; Buffy yelled at Faith.</P>
<P>Allan shook harder as the blood loss increased. He looked up at Buffy.</P>
<P>&quot;Don't move, it's okay...&quot; She was trying to apply pressure to the wound. &quot;I need, I need something to stop the...&quot;</P>
<P>Allan began to convulse, and blood started to trickle from the corner of his mouth. He looked down at his chest one last time, then reached up to Buffy, but his arm never made it. It fell to his side, and his body relaxed against the dumpster, finally dead. His eyes remained wide open.  Buffy gaped, terrified.</P>
<p><I>‘I just killed a guy…’ </I>Faith kept thinking. Then she thought about their safety next.</P>
<P>&quot;We gotta go!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I…can’t. Giles is still…&quot;</P>
<P>Faith closed her eyes, and tried to remember to breathe.</P>
<P>&quot;Fine, go. I’ll take care of this.&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy stared at her.</P>
<P>&quot;Go!&quot;</P>
<P>Buffy ran back towards the entrance of the warehouse.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In a room in city hall, the Mayor was standing in the middle of a pentagram, chanting.</P>
<p>&#9;&quot;Potestatem matris nostrae in tenebris invoco. Maledictum filium tuum abomni periculo custodias nunc et in saecula!&quot;</P>
<P>The building began to shake. The Mayor remained still with his eyes closed and moved with the quake. Mr. Trick looked around nervously, as did Vincent who was locked in a cage. Soon it was over, and the Mayor opened his eyes and checked his watch.</P>
<P>&quot;I don't understand why Allan would miss this. He's usually so punctual.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Did it work?&quot; Trick asked.</P>
<P>&quot;Let's find out. Open the gate.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You sure?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! Hold on&quot;.</P>
<P>He went over to Trick, took Vincent's sword from him, set it tip-down on the floor and let it fall through the cage bars into Vincent's hands. The Mayor stepped back. </P>
<P>&quot;Okay. Now we're ready.&quot;</P>
<P>Trick stepped around to the front of the cage, unlocked the padlock and removed the chains. He pulled open the door, and Vincent rushed out, heading straight for the Mayor. He raised his sword high and brought it down hard on the Mayor's head, slicing it in two. </P>
<P>He didn’t bleed. The flesh inside just shimmered as Vincent pulled back his sword. The two halves of the Mayor's head pulled toward each other and sealed together. He stood before Vincent completely untouched. Mr. Trick waited behind Vincent, and staked him through the back. He exploded into ashes.</P>
<P>&quot;Well! This officially commences the Hundred Days. Nothing can harm me until the Ascension. Gosh, I'm feeling chipper! Who's for a root beer?&quot;</P>
<P>Trick smiled as they left the room.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Back at the warehouse, Giles was trying to work at preventing Balthazar from doing anything rash. </P>
<P>&quot;Look, tell you what, let Captain Courageous here go, and I'll tell you what you need to know. How's that deal?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There is one deal! If your friend here is telling the truth, and my soldiers find the amulet, you will die quickly. If not, you will die slowly. How’s that deal?&quot; </P>
<p>&quot;I really think they should hold out for a better one.&quot; Buffy said, rushing in.</P>
<P>She backhanded one vampire and punched another in the face. The first one raised his sword and tried to attack, but she blocked him and grabbed his arm. She brought it down and kneed him in the gut, making him drop his sword. </P>
<P>Giles saw Buffy catch it, and turned his tied hands toward her. She swung the sword in a high arc and brought it down on the ropes binding his wrists, slicing them cleanly. Giles grabbed Wesley and pushed him out of harm's way.</P>
<P>Buffy swung the sword back at the Eliminatus, but he caught her hand and swung the sword down against the edge of Balthazar's pool, forcing her to drop it. He did a backhand swing at Buffy's face, making her trip forward, but she returned with a back kick at him, and then shoulder rolled onto a large crate to avoid being sliced by another one's sword.</P>
<P>&quot;Unacceptable!&quot; Balthazar yelled.</P>
<P>Out of the way of the fight, Giles untied Wesley's hands. Behind him a vampire roared, and he looked back in time to see and ducked his sword. It hit a shelf, and Giles grabbed the blade and back elbowed the vamp in the face, taking the sword from him. He swung it around and jammed the hilt of the sword into his face as well, then spun around in time to take on another one.</P>
<P>The Eliminatus swung his sword at Giles, who parried it with his own. The vampire swung again, and Giles blocked it. The demon spun around and swung down from above, but again Giles had his sword up in time to block. </P>
<P>He swung his arms around and down, forcing the Eliminatus' sword to the floor and making him bend down with it, and then kneed him in the face. The vampire jerked backward and fell to the floor, dropping his sword. Meanwhile, the one whose sword was taken away by Giles grabbed Wesley from behind, pinning his arms behind his back.</P>
<P>&quot;Giles!&quot;</P>
<P>Giles raised his sword and started to swing it.</P>
<P>&quot;Down!&quot;</P>
<P>Wesley bent over fast, and the blade caught the vampire on the neck and sliced through. The beheaded Eliminatus burst into ashes. Wesley stood back up, shocked at what just happened.</P>
<P>Buffy got to her feet on a raised area of the floor. An Eliminatus came at her with a sword, but she grabbed his arm and pulled him past her over a crate and into a barrel. Another one swung at her, and she blocked him, punched him in the gut, ducked another swing and then backhand punched him in the face. He fell to the floor. </P>
<P>Buffy picked him up and sent him spinning into a huge pile of rope. As he tried to come at her again, she did a spinning wheel kick to his face. He quickly regained his balance and tried to punch her, but she redirected his fist and held onto it while she elbowed him in the face. She swung him around and threw him into a bunch of stacked oil barrels.</P>
<P>She spied an electrical cable hanging down from a lamp directly above Balthazar. She grabbed it and yanked hard, and the lamp fell from the roof with sparks flying right into the pool. Balthazar writhed in agony as he was electrocuted. Giles and Wesley stared in amazement. </P>
<P>Soon Balthazar seemed dead and the circuit breakers shut off the power. Buffy rushed over and looked at Balthazar. She jumped, startled, when his eyes whipped open and he took a sudden, wheezing breath.</P>
<P>&quot;Slayer! You think you've won. When he rises... you'll wish I'd killed you all.&quot;</P>
<P>He let out his last breath and finally died. Buffy looked at Giles, wondering what the demon meant.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>The next morning, Faith was in the bathroom at her apartment, washing blood off her hands, and off her shirt. She heard a knock at the door.</P>
<p>&quot;Faith, it's me.&quot; Buffy called from outside.</P>
<P>She left the shirt in the sink and answered the door. </P>
<P>&quot;Hey.&quot; Buffy said.</P>
<P>&quot;Hey.&quot;</P>
<P>Faith walked back to the bathroom and continued to scrub the shirt. Buffy came in, and followed.</P>
<P>&quot;So, I…how are ya doin'?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'm alright. You know me.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;Do I?&quot; Buffy asked. Faith just stared. &quot;Faith, we need to talk about what we're gonna do.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There's nothing to talk about. I was doing my job.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Being a Slayer is not the same as being a killer.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;You don’t seem to get it. I am a killer. It was what I was hired to do. Slaying is your thing.&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;Wait…&quot;</P>
<p>&quot;Will you stop already? I used you to help me do my job. I was hoping you’d come work with me, but that ain’t gonna happen, is it? You were so close too.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Faith, please don't shut me out here. We play on different sides; you were using me, that doesn’t matter right now. Look, sooner or later, we're both gonna have to deal.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Wrong.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We can help each other.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't need it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yeah? Who's wrong now? Faith, you can shut off all the emotions that you want. But eventually, they're gonna find a body.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Okay, this is the last time we're gonna have this conversation, and we're not even having it now, you understand me? There is no body. I took it, weighted it, and dumped it. The body doesn't exist. </P>
<P>&quot;You have nothing to worry about. You can keep the flawless rep, get your girl, and move on. The next time we see each other though, we’ll be on opposite ends of a blade, I hope you get that.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;Getting rid of the evidence doesn't make the problem go away.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It does for me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Faith, you don't get it. You killed a man.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, you don't get it. I don't care.&quot;</P>
<p>Buffy stared at her, disbelieving.</P>

<p>Buffy snapped awake. Looking at her clock, she saw it was only 11:30. More then twelve hours before, she had left Faith’s apartment after the other slayer had effectively ended any hope of them playing on the same side again. Buffy was scared not only for herself, but for Faith too, because Buffy knew she had gone over the edge.</P>
<p>She also knew what Faith did was an accident, but that didn’t help her any. She was the one who pushed the man to Faith to stake, and she was just as responsible. Looking back on everything, she wished she had been more responsible. In the good, Buffy way. Over the last couple days she hadn’t been herself, and she knew that.</P>
<p>Faith allowed her a freedom she had never considered before. She went along with Faith’s advice to try and gain her trust, and really, to see what it felt like to let go. She found out all right. She had lost control, and a man had paid with his life. Worst of all, she alienated Willow, and she hated herself for it.</P>
<p><I>‘She was right. The whole time. Why did I do that to her?’</P>
</I><p>Willow wouldn’t have told her about Faith if she weren’t it sure it was the truth. She couldn’t imagine how she must have made her feel, to see her go to Faith all the time. </P>
<I><p>‘It hurt her a lot.’</P>
<p></I>Faith was a good excuse to get away from Willow, and if it hadn’t been her, it would’ve been something else. As soon as she saw the look on Willow’s face after she got acceptance letters from every college and university on the planet, Buffy immediately felt like she was going to hold her back. Like she was forcing Willow to stay with her, and denying the world her intelligence and her talent.</P>
<p>She didn’t want to condemn Willow to a life of monsters and death. She wanted to give her a life with no worries. But she couldn’t do that, so the best option to her was to maintain enough distance, so that Willow would eventually decide to move on. She wanted Willow to stay, wanted to be with her, but that was selfish. And being selfish led to being arrested, and then causing two cops to become unconscious.</P>
<p>When she wasn’t thinking about Willow, she was dreaming about the man. Propped up against the dumpster, looking at her though dead eyes. In the dream, the blood never stopped. It just kept coming, and she went under, submerged in an innocent’s blood, and she lost herself forever.</P>
<p>She got out of bed, and rubbed her face. The right thing to do was tell someone, tell Giles, Willow, but she couldn’t. For Faith’s sake. She kept asking herself why she wanted to protect her. Was it because they were slayers? That was part of it, and the other she soon figured out, was because Faith was human. And Buffy killed and hurt demons, not people. Besides, they weren’t going to find the body.</P>
<p>She heard the news on in her mom’s room, and walked just inside the doorway. Buffy went wide-eyed when she heard what they were talking about.</P>
<p>"We go now live to our field reporter, who is standing by at the waterfront with this breaking news about the murder that has shocked the Mayor and residents of Sunnydale." The anchor said.</P>
<p>On the screen it switched to footage from the waterfront earlier in the day. A boat was in the water retrieving Allan’s body.</P>
<P>"Fishermen discovered the body today, the victim of a brutal stabbing. Authorities and citizens alike were shocked when the slain man was identified as Deputy Mayor Allan Finch." The reporter said.</P>
<p><I>‘Oh God…he was…Oh God…’ </I>She started to feel sick.</P>
<P>"Still reeling from the news, Mayor Wilkins had this to say."</P>
<P>The footage switched to the Mayor at a press conference.</P>
<P>"Mr. Finch was not only my longtime aide and associate, he was a close personal friend. I promise you I will not rest until whoever did this is found and brought to justice. Thank you very much."</P>
<P>Joyce turned around, and saw Buffy standing there.</P>
<P>"Oh, honey, you're up. Oh, it's just terrible, isn't it?"</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy was sitting at the table in the library with Willow, Giles was sitting on the steps and Wesley was talking. </P>
<P>"I want you to look into this. Find out everything you can about the murder of the Deputy Mayor."</P>
<P>Buffy tried to hide the guilty look threatening to surface on her face. "It's amazing that you've learned nothing at all about me."</P>
<P>"I'm sorry?"</P>
<P>"Try asking nicely, an apology would be good too." Willow clarified.</P>
<P>"Oh. I apologize, I…it was a mistake, and it will never happen again. Could you please look into…"</P>
<P>"But that's…not really our jurisdiction, is it?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>"She's right. The Deputy Mayor's murder was the result of human malice. There's nothing supernatural about it." Giles said.</P>
<P>"We don't know that for certain. I say it merits investigation."</P>
<P>"Which I'm sure the police are doing. Meantime, if you ask me, there are better uses for the Slayers' time."</P>
<P>"Ah. But I don't believe I did. Ask you."</P>
<P>"Considering the success of your previous adventure..."</P>
<P>"Do I have to lock you into your rooms?" Buffy asked. "Listen, Giles' opinion counts too. You want me to work with you, he's gotta be involved. Got it?"</P>
<P>"Fine. If you have time after your standard patrol, could you possibly check out the Mayor's records?"</P>
<P>"You want her to break into City Hall?" Willow asked.</P>
<P>"Is that a problem?"</P>
<P>Buffy thought back to the alley. <I>'What was he doing there anyway?'</P>
</I><P>It was kind of weird that a deputy mayor would be in an alley in the middle of the night. That would be something. The city government involved in the Hellmouth. Actually, the more she thought about it, the more it made sense.</P>
<P>"No, I'll do it. I have…to get to…"</P>
<P>"Class." Willow said.</P>
<P>"Yeah, that's it."</P>
<P>Willow got up, and they both walked out of the library.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"You know something about it, don't you?" Willow asked Buffy on the way to class.</P>
<p>"No. Why would I?"</P>
<p>"I'm going with you tonight."</P>
<p>"Will…"</P>
<p>"If this has something to do with Faith, and it being too dangerous…"</P>
<p>"No…she's…"</P>
<p>"I'm going."</P>
<p>Willow looked at her, waiting for Buffy to challenge her statement, but it didn't come.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In the Mayor's Office, he was destroying documents through a paper shredder. Trick was standing by watching, holding a folder.</P>
<p>"It's not working."</P>
<P>"It's supposed to do something besides shred?"</P>
<P>"It's supposed to cheer me up. Usually using the shredder gives me a lift. It's fun."</P>
<P>"And today you're not getting the ya-yas."</P>
<P>"No." The Mayor said sadly. "Guess it'll take more than this to turn my frown upside down. I just don't understand why Allan would leave such a paper trail about our dealings. Do you think he was gonna betray me? Oh, now, that's a horrible thought. And now he's dead, I'll never have the chance to scold him."</P>
<P>"Maybe this will change your mood."</P>
<P>Trick dropped a copy of the coroner's report on the desk. The Mayor picked it up and opened it.</P>
<P>"What is it?"</P>
<P>"Bombshell. The Deputy Mayor had wooden splinters in his wound. Struck right through the heart with a sharp, pointed object. Now, word is, someone was fighting vampires not a block away from the scene. Any smart money says it was a Slayer who did this job."</P>
<P>"Why? Do you think he talked?"</P>
<P>"He tried. Didn't get too far though." Faith said walking into the room.</P>
<P>The Mayor turned around and smiled at her.</P>
<P>"Faith! I hope the action was justified."</P>
<P>She couldn't let him know it was an accident. </P>

<I><P>'If he knew it was…' </I>She shuddered.</P>
<P>"Completely, boss. I'm sorry."</P>

<P>"Don't be. In every term of office there are gains and losses. This in no way implicates me. All it does is help. Relax." He walked up to her, and ran his hand across her cheek. "You did good."</P>
<P>"The cops will be all over this." Trick said.</P>
<P>"True, but I will deal with them. There are after all, two slayers in this town."</P>
<P>Faith and Trick grinned. </P>
<P>"Great idea, boss."</P>
<P>"Buffy Summers, is now up for Murder One. That's sunshine and roses to me. It really is."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Later at night, Buffy and Willow snuck into Allan's office. Buffy switched on the light as Willow went over to one of the file drawers. She went over to his desk, and saw a picture of Allan and the Mayor shaking hands at a press conference. </P>
<p><I>'And I feel worse.'</P>
<p></I>She looked up as Willow called her over. Willow handed her a folder. It was empty.</P>
<p>"All his files are gone." Willow said.</P>
<p>"Do you think…?"</P>
<p>"I wouldn't have thought it, but don't you think it's kind of odd that all the records the Deputy Mayor kept are just gone?"</P>
<p>"Then how much do you wanna bet that's who…"</P>
<p>Buffy suddenly hushed as they both heard noises out in the hall. They went to the door, and cracked it open. The Mayor and Trick were talking and walking down the hall. Buffy quickly shut the door.</P>
<p>"That guy's a vampire."</P>
<p>"The Mayor?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"No the other one. I'm gonna follow them. See what else you can find."</P>
<p>"Be careful."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy crept out into the hall, and looked at the door that had just shut. She got halfway down, creeping along the wall, when she felt hands grab her and pull her into a room. She couldn't move, and she felt metal against her neck.</P>
<p>"I didn't think you'd be stupid enough to come here." Faith said.</P>
<p>"So, this is your boss's place, huh?"</P>
<p>"I work for the top guys. I won't settle for less."</P>
<p>"You gonna slit my throat or can I go?"</P>
<p>"No…I was gonna slit your throat."</P>
<p>Buffy stomped her foot on top of Faith's causing her to drop the knife right into Buffy's hands. She elbowed Faith in the stomach, and the other slayer staggered back.</P>
<p>"Come on, B. Use the knife."</P>
<p>"I aim to please."</P>
<p>Buffy threw the knife right above Faith's head, and it stuck into the wall.</P>
<p>"How'd I know you wouldn't do it?"</P>
<p>She rushed at Buffy, and they both fell to the ground. Faith was on top, and put her hands around Buffy's neck.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow grabbed the lamp off Allan's desk, and opened the door again. Buffy had been gone too long. She knew she should stay in the room, but she also knew something was wrong. Everything seemed okay, but in her experience, when something seemed okay, it usually wasn't.</P>
<p>She made up her mind when she heard a thump. She walked out, and shut the door behind her. As she walked past a couple more doors, she saw one was open. She peaked around the corner, and saw Faith choking Buffy.</P>
<p>She rushed in, and slammed the lamp over Faith's head. It shattered, and Faith let go off of Buffy's neck. She kicked her off, and back, hard into the wall. She flipped up into a standing position.</P>
<p>"Are you okay?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"Yeah thanks."</P>
<p>"You brought your bitch, B?"</P>
<p>Rage swelled up inside Buffy, and she punched Faith right on the bridge of her nose. She started to bleed.</P>
<p>"You're close, still didn't go for the kill."</P>
<p>"Like you did?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>Faith had an evil smile on her face, and Willow stood in front of her.</P>
<p>"Buffy tried to protect you from murder charges. She's a lot nicer than I am. You may be able to kill me right now, but I just have to say that you had your shot. You could've had us as friends, but you decided to choose evil.</P>
<p>"Well, keep it. Eventually it's gonna come back to haunt you, and you'll wish you stayed with us. See you may have protection from murder, some power, but you don't have friends, and you don't have love. I pity you."</P>
<p>"We have to go." Buffy said smirking.</P>
<p>They turned around, and started to leave. Faith didn't move.</P>
<p>"The Mayor's got this town wired. He built it for demons to feed on. You may have love, but it ain't gonna last. Come graduation day, you'll be dead. And I wouldn't be surprised if you had some people waiting for you at home, B."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow and Buffy were sitting in Willow's room. Buffy was reluctant to go home.</P>
<p>"Why didn't you tell me?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"I don't know. I was scared, I guess."</P>
<p>"Of me?"</P>
<p>"For you. The more I pull you in, the less likely it is that you'll be able to get out."</P>
<p>"Who said I wanted to get out?"</P>
<p>"Why wouldn't you? I've been really messed up, I helped kill a guy…"</P>
<p>"You didn't do anything. You didn't put a stake in his heart. You have to tell Giles."</P>
<p>"I know I do. Faith is gone, and I'll have to deal with her."</P>
<p>"We'll have to deal."</P>
<p>"Will, you have a great opportunity to do something with your life, and I don't want you to feel…"</P>
<p>"I know I have a great opportunity. When we were facing off with Faith, things just, kind of, got clear. I mean, you've been fighting evil here for three years, and I've helped some, and now we're supposed to decide what we want to do with our lives. </P>
<P>"And I just realized that that's what I want to do. Fight evil, help people. I mean, I-I think it's worth doing. And I don't think you do it because you have to. It's a good fight, Buffy, and I want in."</P>
<P>"I kind of love you."</P>
<P>"Kind of?"</P>
<P>"Really love you."</P>
<P>"I was beginning to think…"</P>
<P>"I know. I was trying…actually; right now I can't remember what I was trying to do. I guess I never realized that you helped cause you wanted to do. I had always thought you did it cause you thought I was making you. And I wanted to let you have the life, I thought you wanted."</P>
<P>"I want this life."</P>
<P>"I know that now." Buffy kissed Willow. "And I'm glad you do. I couldn't do this without you."</P>
<P>"I'm never leaving, okay? Never."</P>
<P>"Same here. And if I ever don't act like me again…"</P>
<P>"I'll get you out of it." Willow kissed her.</P>
<P>"As much as I'd like to find out how, I should get home."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy got home, and was greeted by her mom, and a police officer. He wanted to question her about something, and she knew what it was.</P>
<P>"What time did you get home last night?"</P>
<P>"Late. Um, a little past 1:00, I guess."</P>
<P>"Maybe you can explain to me what a girl your age is doing out all night."</P>
<P>"I was at a friend's…watching TV."</P>
<P>"Hmm. That's funny 'cause I got a couple of witnesses who put you near the alley."</P>
<P>"Witnesses?"</P>
<P>"A murder happened there last night."</P>
<P>"Yeah, I heard about it on the news."</P>
<P>"Somebody stabbed this guy through the heart. Strange thing is, the weapon, it was made out of wood. Any of this mean anything to you?"</P>
<P>"Sorry, no. Is that it? I'm kinda beat."</P>
<P>"Yeah, I have enough for now. Buffy, if you know something, if you're protecting someone, I promise you it'll be better for everyone if you just come clean."</P>
<P>"I wish I could help you."</P>
<P>"Well, call me if you remember anything."
</P>
<hr width=100>

<P>"The Slayer, and her friend. Right here in the building." The Mayor said to Trick and Faith lo oking at the security camera tapes.</P>
<P>"There was supposed to be a guard."</P>
<P>"Here comes my favorite part. They see us in the hall together, thick as thieves. Oh, wait, we are thieves. And worse. And now they know it."</P>
<P>"Well, they're not gonna be much of a threat in jail."</P>
<P>"Well, we don't have near enough evidence to put 'em away. And Faith was injured trying to protect my interests. You're gonna have to come up with a more efficient solution. And Mr. Trick, you better think of it soon."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy went immediately to the library, and Giles called everyone.</P>
<p>"We have a problem." Wesley said. "The Mayor seems to be more informed about this town's demonic activity then we realized."</P>
<p>"That's an understatement." Willow said. "Are you okay, Buffy?"</P>
<p>"Considering I just got interrogated by the police, and watched a man die…I could be worse."</P>
<p>"Well, if you're worried about jail time, don't be. I doubt they have enough evidence to hold you, and not even the Mayor's word would be enough." Giles said.</P>
<p>"What does he want?" Xander asked.</P>
<p>"Me in the ground?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"I think it's more than that." Giles said.</P>
<p>"I tend to agree. If your information is correct, we have to work to find out as much as possible about Mr. Richard Wilkins III before graduation." Wesley said.</P>
<p>"Let's do it then." Oz said.</P>
<p>"Yeah, I really would like to graduate." Cordelia said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Trick was sitting in the Mayor's chair, when Faith came walking in.</P>
<p>"You're doing it already." Faith said.</P>
<p>"The man's losing control. Invincibility only gets you so far. Gotta be ready to take the reigns."</P>
<p>Faith walked over to the blinds.</P>
<p>"I'd get out of that chair before you make a mistake."</P>
<p>"Or he'll kill me? You've made plenty of mistakes and your still kicking."</P>
<p>"Trick do you know what time it is?"</P>
<p>He looked at her, and then he understood. But it was too late. She opened the blinds, and the morning sun poured in. Within seconds, the screaming stopped, and the dust settled on the chair.</P>
<p>"I hope you know what you're doing, my dear." The Mayor walked in.</P>
<p>"Vampires are good for fighting, but once they get a brain, they're dangerous. Believe me."</P>
<p>"Oh I do. Just one thing." Faith looked scared for a minute. "Clean off the chair?"</P>
