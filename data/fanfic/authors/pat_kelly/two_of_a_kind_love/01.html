<P>Buffy felt dead inside. Standing in the hospital room where her best friend lay in a coma, she was hollow. She was numb. She knew she was breathing, but couldn’t feel the air circulating in her lungs. She knew her heart was beating, but to her, it was frozen in place.</P>
<P>"The doctor said it was head trauma. She can wake up at any time, but... the longer it lasts, the... less likely it is." Xander said, standing beside her.</P>
<P>She brushed back a few stray hairs that were out of place on her friend’s face. She could see how pale Willow was. Her mouth, usually smiling, showed no signs of doing that anytime soon.</P>
<P>"I never should've let her try to do that curse. Angel must've known." Buffy said.</P>
<P>And it was the truth. She should have never let her do it, but Willow would have protested until she gave in. Willow was always ready to help her, and this time she may have cost herself her life.</p>
<P>Buffy didn’t care about Angel, Acathla, the murder charges, any of that. It just didn’t matter. At this moment, all that mattered was Willow. It put everything into perspective for Buffy. A perspective she was just beginning to understand. She knew that if she lost Willow, whether she ever got Angel back again or not, she couldn’t keep going.</P>
<P>"Where are her parents?" Buffy asked.</p>
<P>"With relatives in Phoenix. I gave them a call. They're... they're getting on a plane back."</p>
<P>"Does Oz know?"</p>
<P>"Oh, man...I didn't even think...I'll call him."</p>
<P>Hearing footsteps, they both reluctantly turned away to see who was coming. Cordelia slowly came in, and her gaze immediately traveled down to Willow’s still form.</P>
<p>"Hey." Xander said softly, hugging her.</p>
<p>"Hey." She responded just as softly. "How is she? The doctor told me that..."</p>
<P>"Yeah. We're, uh...still waiting."</P>
<P>They both looked at Buffy who was not paying any attention to their conversation. Her eyes were locked onto her friend’s face. Realizing how quiet she was, she broke away, and looked up at Cordelia.</P>
<P>"You okay?" Buffy asked finally.</p>
<P>"I ran. I think I made it through three counties before I realized nobody was chasing me. Not too brave."</p>
<P>"It was the right thing to do."</p>
<P><I>‘If I had been as sensible as Cordelia, I might have stopped...’ </I>Buffy started thinking to herself.</P>
<P>She should have known the whole thing was a set up from the get go. It wasn’t like Angel to challenge her out in the open. He would never request a fight. It lacked style. She should have known something was up.</P>
<P>"Did -" Xander started to say, as Buffy cut him off.</P>
<P>"Could you guys...give me a few minutes?"</P>
<P>Any objections they had to her request were washed a way as soon as they looked at her expression. It was one of pleading need.</P>
<P>"We’ll be right outside." Cordelia said, ushering Xander out the room before he could say anything.</P>
<P>Buffy heard the door shut, and sat down on empty space on the bed. Sighing out of weariness, she finally let the tears come. Sobbing, she laid her head down on Willow’s chest, and put her friend’s hand in hers.</P>
<P>Now that she was alone, technically, she allowed herself to think about Willow. She felt like she was on the verge of clarity. Something she should have allowed herself to realize a long time ago, but never did.</P>
<P>Willow was a unique individual. And that was putting it mildly. She was so brilliant, intelligent, resourceful. But that was just scratching the surface. On the outside, she seemed fragile, unsure. But inside, she was a confident, incredibly strong, person. Stronger than Buffy herself in a lot of ways.</P>
<P>Despite everything Buffy had put her through, she still managed to cling onto that innocence Buffy had lost a long time ago. But it wasn’t an innocence that a child possessed. A child’s innocence was one of complete and blissful ignorance, where the events of the world didn’t matter, and didn’t affect you in any way. There was still that wonder of new surroundings, and nothing could hurt you.</P>
<P>No that was not Willow’s innocence, for she had seen many horrible things, more than anybody should have to see at the age of seventeen. Her innocence, well, Buffy couldn’t find a word for it. It had elements of a child’s, yet it also had a great deal of maturity. Whatever it was, it allowed Willow to always look at the bright side of life.</P>
<P>Buffy wanted that innocence. She craved it. Innocence or no, it was still beyond her how after narrowly escaping death, Willow could have a smile on her face the next day. And the smile wasn’t put there for anyone’s benefit either. It was a true, honest to goodness, smile. She could never stay mad at anyone, would never intentionally hurt anyone, and was loyal to the end.</P>
<P>The more Buffy thought about it, the more she understood. Willow was her innocence. She was the one who filled the empty hole in Buffy’s soul, she was the one who comforted Buffy, the one who reminded her what a life was like, and why it was important to hold on to it.</P>
<P>As hard as it was to admit to herself, no one else did that. Not Giles, not her mom, and not...Angel. Everyone else tried to protect her, guide her in what they assumed was the right direction. Giles still didn’t agree with her actions as a slayer. Her mom tried desperately to keep her cooped up away from the big bad world that she didn’t even understand herself. And Angel, even as much as he had loved her, still had tried to shield himself from her, thinking she couldn’t handle him and his past.</P>
<P>Even Xander had his opinions on the way she did things, trying to force her to do the right thing. Well, the right thing in his mind. It showed her that they cared, and it meant a lot to her, but they didn’t trust her. Not completely anyway. And right now, it would be hard to argue that point considering what she had done. But Willow had never questioned her, never judged her, and never got on her case if something went wrong.</P>
<P>Miss Calendar was a prime example. Ever since her death, Xander had been on a ‘Die, Angel, Die’ crusade. It seemed to everyone else that he focused all blame solely on Angel, but Buffy could see it in his eyes. He blamed her too. Giles eyes told her the same thing. They may have not said it out loud, but she knew. Every time they looked at her now, she felt like she was being drilled into. She felt uncomfortable, and sometimes, even hated. And to her, the looks were worse than the actual words.</P>
<P>And considering that she already placed all the blame on herself, she couldn’t handle anymore from them. Willow hadn’t blamed her. She had comforted her, and her eyes only held a look of understanding and sympathy. Buffy felt safe around Willow. She felt completed. She felt unconditional trust, friendship, and...</P>
<P><I>‘Oh my God...’ </I>Buffy thought.</P>
<P>The clarity hit her. She finally understood. She took her head off of Willow’s chest, and looked at her face.</P>
<I><P>‘I love Willow...’</P>
</I><P>That realization comforted her as well as scared her. Had she loved her all this time? If she had, that meant Buffy risked her life for nothing. That meant her love for Angel wasn’t as strong as she thought it was. If that was true, then what was Angel? What if Willow didn’t? What if... The more she mulled over her new understanding, the more confused she got.</P>
<P>She moved her face up to Willow’s, and kissed her friend’s lips softly. She had to say it before she second-guessed herself. Before she questioned her instincts, her feelings.</P>
<P>"I love you, Will."</P>
<P>By the door, Cordelia listened quietly. Xander started to go in.</P>
<P>"Don’t, Xander."</P>
<P>"Don’t? But I -"</P>
<P>"Just don’t."</P>
<P>By the bed, Buffy had drifted off to sleep.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>When she awoke, she wasn’t in the hospital anymore. Looking at her surroundings, she saw that she was in Angel’s old apartment. On his bed. The place that started her life on a downward spiral that just seemed to keep going.</P>
<p><I>‘How did I get here?’ </I>She questioned herself.</P>
<p>Then she got it.</P>
<p><I>‘Dream.’</I></P>
<p>"Have a nice nap?" said an all too familiar voice.</P>
<p>Buffy looked at the entryway that led into the bedroom. Willow walked in. She wasn’t wearing a hospital gown; she was wearing a pink sweater with a large yellow daisy on the front, and light red skirt.</P>
<p>"Willow? Are you here?"</P>
<p>"I don’t know really. Do you think I am?"</P>
<p>"If it is really you, then are you...dead?"</P>
<p>Buffy prayed to whatever might have been listening for that not to be true.</P>
<p>"Well, I’m not carrying a harp. Does that answer your question?"</P>
<p>"But you’re Jewish. Do you even have harps in the afterlife?"</P>
<p>"Okay, a draydle then. Either way, I am still of the living. Well sorta."</P>
<p>"What do you mean?"</P>
<p>"Well I’m still in the coma. So I’m in between."</P>
<p>Buffy’s sadness and guilt showed clearly on her face.</P>
<p>"And it’s not your fault. I knew the risks. Besides I’m gonna make it. Soon."</P>
<p>Buffy felt some hope rise within her, as Willow came to sit down next to her on the bed.</P>
<p>"I’m confused." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"I know."</P>
<p>"I meant it though."</P>
<p>"You really love me?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"Yeah. I do."</P>
<p>"Then why are we here?"</p>
<p>"You don’t know?"</P>
<p>"Hey, this is your dream."</P>
<p>"I guess...this is automatically what I think of when I want to escape from my life. Despite what happened here."</P>
<p>"This place has good memories too."</P>
<p>"But does this mean I’ll never let go of Angel? I don’t want to hurt you."</P>
<p>"You’ll never let go of Angel. He’ll always be special to you. Like Xander is to me. Oz too."</P>
<p>"So Angel was just a first love thing? It seemed so much more then that..."</P>
<p>"Only you know what Angel was to you. Xander was a crush, a love that never got a chance to take off for me, and Oz is nice, but something still feels missing when I’m with him."</P>
<p>"Do you love me?"</P>
<p>"I’m not sure. My head’s kinda messy right now. That’s a pretty loaded question."</P>
<p>Buffy smiled in understanding.</P>
<P>"Too bad I’ll never have a chance to find out."</P>
<p>"What do you mean?"</P>
<p>"Well, I probably won’t remember any of this when I wake up, plus I know what you’re thinking of doing if you survive and stop Angel."</P>
<p><I>‘I’m going to leave...’</I></P>
<p>"It’s pretty unfair to me, to us, to say something as strong as I love you and then split. If I mean as much to you as you say I do..."</P>
<p>"You know I mean it. But what other choice do I have? All I end up doing is hurting you...hurting everybody."</P>
<p>"That’s not true, and you know it."</P>
<p>Around Buffy, everything was fading. She was waking up.</P>
<p>"Guess you gotta go, huh?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"Guess so." Buffy said sadly.</P>
<p>"Will you be there when I come to?"</P>
<p>Before Buffy could answer, the dream world was gone, and she was staring at Xander.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<hr width=100>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<p>"How long was I out?" Buffy asked.</P>
<p>"Five minutes."</P>
<p><I>‘Only five minutes?’</I></P>
<p>She saw the worried look in his eyes, and she immediately snapped to full attention mode.</P>
<p>"Xand? What is it?"</P>
<p>"I was talking with Cordy..."</P>
<p>"And?"</P>
<p>"She said Giles never followed her out. He hasn’t been here. We don’t -"</P>
<p>With a quick glance to check and make sure Willow was still in the bed and wasn’t going anywhere, Buffy shot up, and ran out the door.</P>

<hr width=100>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<p>Well, it was over. She had done her duty. She sent him to hell to save the world. Now she stood under a tree across the street from the school. The whole gang was there, probably talking about where she was. She saw Willow in the wheelchair. That was the clincher for her to make her decision.</P>
<p><I>‘She’s sitting in that because of me.’</I></P>
<p>She had wanted to stay. After the dream she had changed her mind, and told herself she wasn’t going to leave. But then things got worse. On top of Kendra’s death, her being a fugitive, and her friends’ injuries, she was also expelled, her mom practically threw her out of the house, Giles had been tortured, and she sent Angel, soul and all, to Hell.</P>
<p>Could anyone really blame her for leaving?</P>
<p>"Where you going?" A voice asked.</P>
<p>She glanced over to her side. Angel was standing there, a surreal light illuminating him. She thought it was odd, not only that he was here, but also that she didn’t have more of a reaction. Her thoughts were elsewhere, however.</P>
<p>"Away," she finally answered, "where I can’t hurt anybody. I’m sorry."</P>
<p>"Don’t be. You did what you had to do."</P>
<p>"But you’re -"</P>
<p>"I was saved. I’m," he looked up toward the sky, "up there now."</P>
<p>"Good. You deserve to be."</P>
<p>"You really think you’ll stop hurting them if you leave? There’ll still be vampires."</P>
<p>"They wouldn’t put themselves in danger."</P>
<p>"You know that isn’t true. You know they feel just as much responsibility to fight as you do. You’ll hurt them more."</P>
<p>Buffy was silent.</P>
<p>"Look at her." Angel said, pointing to Willow.</P>
<p>Willow was looking left and right searching for any sign of her. There was uncertainty in her expression. There was sadness.</P>
<p>"She cares so much for you. I guarantee you’ll hurt her a lot."</P>
<p>"She’ll be better off." Buffy said, unsure.</P>
<p>"You know that thing you love about her? The innocence? The happiness?"</P>
<p>"It’ll still be there."</P>
<p>"Maybe. But it’ll take some serious damage. She won’t be the same."</P>
<p>Buffy didn’t want to be the one to damage Willow’s personality.</P>
<p>"She does love you. She just doesn’t realize how much yet."</P>
<p>"But what about -"</P>
<p>"What we had? Just because you love her doesn’t lessen what we were."</P>
<p>"How do you know?"</P>
<p>"Buffy, I loved you. I will always love you."</P>
<p>"Me too."</p>
<p>"We were first loves. Yes even though I lived for three centuries, you were my first love. I never truly loved anybody until I met you. But in the long run, it wouldn’t have survived. Not to say we probably wouldn’t have tried to make it work.</P>
<p>"You’re going to age, I wouldn’t have. We wouldn’t have been able to spend days together, wake up next to each other. Maybe in another life time things will be different, but for now..."</P>
<p>"Willow huh?"</P>
<p>"You’re happier when you’re around her. You know that. Truly happy, and that’s all I ever wanted for you. I fulfilled my destiny. I saved the world. Meeting you and loving you along the way was a bonus I didn’t deserve, but I’m glad I got the chance.</P>
<p>"Don’t throw away your chance at happiness. And don’t worry about hurting Willow. She’s tougher then she looks."</P>
<p>"Don’t I know it." Buffy smiled.</P>
<p>Angel vanished.</P>
<p>"Good bye, Angel." She said quietly.</P>
<p>She looked across the street. The gang was starting to head into school. With a deep breath, she ran across the street.</P>
<p>"Hey guys! Wait up." She called.</P>
<p>They  all turned around, and Willow had a smile and look of relief on her face.</P>
<p>"Told you." Willow said to Xander. "How’s..."</P>
<p>"Gone. But...happy." Buffy smiled at Willow. "Thank you."</P>
<p>"It was nothing."</P>
<p>"Giles, there was this tiny problem of me being expelled."</P>
<p>"I’ll take care of it."</P>
<p>Buffy didn’t want to ask him to elaborate on that. She saw Oz pushing Willow.</P>
<p>"Do you mind if I take over?" Buffy asked him.</P>
<p>"Nope. Go right ahead."</P>
<p>Buffy got behind the chair and started to push.</P>
<p>"Want me to go real fast?"</P>
<p>Willow nodded enthusiastically.</p>
<p>When they were far enough away from the rest of the gang, Willow looked up at Buffy.</P>
<p>"I don’t know how or why, but I remember it."</P>
<p>"The dream ‘it’?"</P>
<p>"Yes, that ‘it’."</P>
<p>Buffy held her breath waiting for the answer.</P>
<p>"And I do."</P>
<p>Buffy smiled down at her, and held her hand. The rest of the gang came running up.</P>
<p>"What is it with you gals and needing to go fast while injured?" Xander asked.</P>
<p>"I don’t know, Xand." Buffy responded.</P>
<p>"We must be two of a kind." Willow said.</P>
<p>With that, they entered the school.</P>

<tr><td class=h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 2: Figuring Out</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Willow was trying to concentrate on taking her last final of her junior year. Really she was. She just couldn’t seem to stay focused. And usually concentrating on academics let her forget her confusion. Buffy was in the front row taking the final too. That was the problem.</P>
<p>Somehow Giles had gotten her expulsion revoked. Willow didn’t know how he did it, but all she knew was that Principal Snyder had taken a sick day today. </P>
<p><I>‘Just one more question, and then you’re done. Then you can go.’ </I>Willow told herself. Filling in the final bubble on her scantron sheet, she put her still sharp number-two pencil down, and raised her hand.</P>
<p>"Yes, Willow?" The proctor asked.</P>
<p>"I’m finished. Can I go to the bathroom?"</P>
<p>"Do you need assistance with your chair?"</P>
<p>Willow saw Buffy start to get up.</P>
<p>"No I got it."</P>
<p>She saw the hurt in Buffy’s eyes, but pushed herself to the bathroom. </P>

<hr width=100>

<P>She looked at herself in the mirror. She thought she looked better. Well, less corpse-like anyway. She needed to think.</P>
<p>She wasn’t distracted by Buffy because she had a burning desire to kiss her or anything like that, (although since their mutual admission it had crossed her mind), it was more that she didn’t know how to act or what to do. She admitted that she loved her, and that was the truth, but what next? She was a seventeen-year-old, book/computer geek, innocent Jewish girl. She had always followed everyone else’s expectations, and never did anything that could be considered "out of society’s norm". But this, this was a huge leap out of the norm.</P>
<p>It’s not that she had a problem with people who chose to be ‘that way’, but she had never thought of herself as ‘that way’. It scared her. As much as she hated to think it, she was concerned about what people would say. But even that wasn’t the real issue.</P>
<p>She didn’t want to hurt anybody. And by that, she meant Oz. She had always believed that love was love. So what if they were both females? If love hits you, you can’t just push it away. </P>
<p><I>‘But Oz…’</I></P>
<p>She figured out a while ago that Xander was a crush, and seeing him happy with Cordelia, made her happy. But Oz was a terrific guy. A great all around person, actually. He had helped her to come out of her shell. Made her less shy, less afraid. More open. But Buffy also did that. Buffy was the one who had made her go up to him in the first place.</P>
<p><I>‘She’s done so much for me.’</I></P>
<p>She had gotten Willow to wear that outfit on Halloween, and forced her to realize how beautiful she really was. Had supported her when Xander couldn’t, had been her first real female friend. Buffy gave her that, and Oz repeatedly kept showing her why she was beautiful and worth it.</P>
<p>"I don’t know what to do." She said aloud.</P>
<p>"Don’t worry about it."</P>
<p>In the mirror, she saw Cordelia come up behind her.</P>
<p>"Cordelia!"</P>
<p>"Buffy or Oz, huh? Tough choice."</P>
<p>"How’d you know?"</P>
<p>"Oh please. It’s obvious. Besides, I heard her in the hospital."</P>
<p>"Oh." Willow said quietly and suddenly was worried.</P>
<p>"Relax. I can keep quiet."</P>
<p>"You’re not gonna make any kind of comment at all?"</P>
<p>"What would be the point?"</P>
<p>"True."</P>
<p>"What you need right now is to make a decision."</P>
<p>"Gee thanks for letting me know." Willow said sarcastically.</P>
<p>"Personally, if I had to choose between Buffy and Oz, I’d choose Buffy. Not that I’m…ya know."</P>
<p>"I didn’t think I was either, okay? Why would you pick Buffy?"</P>
<p>"Cause she’s different than you."</P>
<p>"You think?"</P>
<p>"I mean it. You give her things she doesn’t have; she gives you things you don’t have. You’ve changed a lot, Willow. Buffy gives you confidence, you help her keep her sanity. I hate to go Jerry Maguire on you, but you complete one another."</P>
<p>"And Oz?"</P>
<p>"Is like you more than not. He’s a brain, he’s into computers, and he’s quiet. People who have more sames than differences don’t survive in a relationship. It’s boring."</P>
<p>"So that’s why you and Xander are still together huh?"</P>
<p>"Exactly. He’s gives me a sense of humor and helps me keep things light, and I give him fashion sense."</P>
<p>Willow laughed. "You sure about that?"</P>
<p>"Hey I’m working on it, okay?" Cordelia smiled.</P>
<p>Willow had to admit that she was surprised by Cordelia’s advice. Not because she gave her advice, but because it actually made sense. She and Cordelia had grown closer and she was glad she was a serious part of the group now. Willow needed to talk about all this with Buffy, and that’s what she was going to do.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow was walking slowly, on crutches, around Buffy’s bedroom. Buffy was out patrolling, and her mom had told Willow she could come in and wait for her. Everything that Buffy was - was contained in this room. Everything from her life before her duty trapped her.</P>
<p>Stuffed animals were on her bed, ice skates were hanging on the back of her dresser chair, and pictures were situated on her dresser mirror. One of the pictures was of Buffy, her, and Xander at the ice rink. They were standing over an embarrassed Xander, who had fallen on his butt. Willow laughed. Buffy had a lot of talent on the ice. If not for her slaying, she would probably be training for the Olympics right now.</P>
<p>She wasn’t sure when her love for Buffy had surpassed friendship. She didn’t even know that love was what she felt until recently. Everyone knew that Willow wasn’t too sure of her emotions. She thought it started after she had begun getting over her hopeless pursuit of Xander.</P>
<p>Buffy had helped her to grow, and while she was depressed about how Xander had never even glanced at her, she complemented Willow. Made her feel attractive, supported her. At first, she thought that it was just friendly support, but she saw something in Buffy’s eyes.</P>
<p>Nothing verging on lust or anything like that, but more like a genuine affection, even when she was wrapped up in Angel. As quickly as she saw it, it was gone just as quickly. And that’s when she met Oz. Someone who actually liked her.</P>
<p>He was a guitar player. In a band. And if that wasn’t shocking enough, he was actually sensitive. Not like a regular guy at all. And she got swept up in it all. Everything was great, and then Buffy’s life fell apart.</P>
<p>As much as Willow wanted to be happy, she couldn’t. Not just because her life was threatened, but because Buffy was, to put in its simplest form, extremely unhappy. And Buffy needed her for support, but didn’t come to her because Buffy wanted her not to worry. She had always put Willow’s happiness before her own. 	</P>
<p>So when she had a chance to give Buffy back what she thought would make her happy, she took it. She tried to give Angel back his soul. She knew it was dangerous, but how could she not risk her life for Buffy? She had given Willow so much.</P>
<p>If it came down to Buffy and Oz, she would pick Buffy over him without question. And it wasn’t because she was closer to Buffy or liked her anymore than Oz; it was because if Buffy had died, she would never be the same. She had a lot of time to think in the hospital. In the coma and out, and got her priorities in order.</P>
<p>She loved Buffy. After she had ‘visited’ Buffy, and found out she was going to leave after it was all said and done, Willow knew then and there, what emotion she had always felt toward Buffy. It had been hidden, but it was love. </P>
<P>She was still uncertain as to what would happen in the coming months, but she knew they would always have their friendship to fall back on. </P>
<I><P>‘And what good is love without friendship?’ </P>
</I><P>Willow jumped as Buffy came through the window.</P>
<P>"Uh…hi, Buffy. Why’d you come through the window?"</P>
<P>"Mom."</P>
<P>"Oh she left about a half an hour ago. Some emergency shipment came in for the gallery. She’s still not comfortable with the whole Slayer thing?"</P>
<P>"Try extremely uncomfortable. She’s in semi-denial, and we haven’t been talking. Plus she wigged on Giles."</P>
<P>"And that still didn’t convince her?"</P>
<P>"What can I say? She’s stubborn."</P>
<P>"Like mother, like –"</P>
<P>"Watch it."</P>
<P>Willow grinned.</P>
<P>"Hey. How’d you get up here?"</P>
<P>"Crutches."</P>
<P>"Don’t over exert yourself."</P>
<P>"I think I do need to sit."</P>
<P>Buffy helped her to sit down on the bed.</P>
<P>"Thanks. How’d patrolling go?"</P>
<P>"Nada."</P>
<P>"No vampires?"</P>
<P>"Since Spike and Dru split, it’s been pretty quiet."</P>
<P>"Well, that’s a good."</P>
<P>"You think I’d be too optimistic if I said we might have a relaxing summer?"</P>
<P>"Maybe just a little."</P>
<P>There was an uncomfortable silence for a few minutes, before Buffy said what they were both thinking.</P>
<P>"So…I guess we should talk."</P>
<P>"Yeah. Talking is a good thing."</P>
<P>"I gotta admit, I’m not sure what to do. It’s a little scary."</P>
<P>"You mean I’m not the only one who thinks that?"</P>
<P>Buffy laughed. "Course not."</P>
<P>"Good, cause I never thought I was…you know."</P>
<P>"Me neither. Who says we are?"</P>
<P>"But we like, love –"</P>
<P>Buffy smiled. "Each other. But I’ve never thought of any other girls ‘that way’. Not until you."</P>
<P>"Me neither."</P>
<P>That was strange but also very comforting to Willow. It made this step that they were taking, all the more special to her.</P>
<P>"Now what?"</P>
<P>"Angel."</P>
<P>"He…was special. And I know there’ll always be a part of me that will love him. But, I think, I know, he’s okay with…‘us’. Oz."</P>
<P>"He’s hard to describe. First guy I loved.  Well, besides Xander. But Oz and I actually have a relationship. It’s nothing like you and Angel had, but…"</P>
<P>"I know what you mean. Look, if you don’t want to –"</P>
<P>"I do, I do. I just need to think of what to say to him."</P>
<P>Another uncomfortable silence passed, before Willow spoke again.</P>
<P>"Should we?"</P>
<P>"We don’t have to."</P>
<P>"Cause it’s still a little strange and all –"</P>
<P>"Yeah it is."</P>
<P>"But –"</P>
<P>Before Willow could say another word, Buffy’s lips were covering hers. It was a simple kiss. Longer than a normal friendly kiss, but no farther than that. When they pulled away, it was like an electric shock passed through them.</P>
<P>Willow was smiling.</P>
<P>"That was…nice."</P>
<P>"Very nice." Buffy paused. "Will, I want you to know, that no matter what happens, that I never want to lose our friendship."</P>
<P>"Never happen. But I need to say this out loud. I love you." As soon as it was out of her mouth, she felt extremely happy. She could see the same happiness reflected back in Buffy's eyes.</P>
<P>"Good, cause I love you too."</P>
<P>Willow’s stomach growled.</P>
<P>"Somebody’s hungry." </P>
<P>"I haven’t eaten much since I got out of the hospital."</P>
<P>"Ice cream?"</P>
<P>"Rocky road?"</P>
<P>"You got it. Be right back."</P>
<P>"Hey Buffy?"</P>
<P>"Yeah?"</P>
<P>Willow had a glint in her eyes.</P>
<P>"Slumber Party!" They both said.</P>
<P>"Cordelia and Xander?" Willow asked.</P>
<P>"Oz?"</P>
<P>"He’s not much into group sleepovers."</P>
<P>"Try anyway?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>"Okay." Willow said picking up Buffy’s phone.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Several hours later, Buffy and Willow were lying on Buffy’s bed, Cordelia and Xander were sitting on the floor, and Oz was sitting in the chair.</P>
<P>"We’ve already watched two movies, and gone through three bags of popcorn. Shouldn’t you two men be heading downstairs to go to sleep?" Buffy said.</P>
<P>"I for one plan on camping out right here." Xander said.</P>
<P>Buffy shook her head.</P>
<P>"I thought we were buds!"</P>
<P>"Oh we are. But there’s always limits to ‘bud’ privileges."</P>
<P>"We should tell them before they go to sleep, don’t you think?" Willow asked Buffy.</P>
<P>"Did you wanna tell them now?"</P>
<P>"Oh if its about you two being a couple thing, don’t worry about it." Cordelia said.</P>
<P>"Cordelia!" They both shrieked.</P>
<P>"Yeah, Cordy filled us in already. Why do you think I wanna sleep in here?" Xander waggled his eyebrows.</P>
<P>He got hit with every stuffed animal and pillow that was on the bed.</P>
<P>"You seem okay with this, Xand."</P>
<P>"Well, Will’s so much better for you then Angel. Besides, it helps broaden my fantasy library."</P>
<P>"Xander!" Willow said in shock. Cordelia hit him that time.</P>
<P>"I guess that’s my cue to go downstairs?"</P>
<P>"You learn fast." Buffy said.</P>
<P>Xander slowly walked out of the room.</P>
<P>"Guess I better go too." Oz said.</P>
<P>"Wait, Oz. Can we talk somewhere?" Willow asked.</P>
<P>Oz nodded.</P>
<P>"You can use mom’s room." Buffy said.</P>
<P>As Willow and Oz left the room, Buffy glared at Cordelia.</P>
<P>"What?"</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Willow and Oz sat on Joyce’s bed.</P>
<P>"So…" They said at the same time.</P>
<P>"Are you okay?" Willow asked gently.</P>
<P>"Still in shock mode right now."</P>
<P>"You’re not the only one, believe me. You think I saw this coming?"</P>
<P>"No, because if you did, you would’ve told me."</P>
<P>"You know I would have."</P>
<P>"You can take care of each other. You’re good for one another."</P>
<P>"You’re my first real love, I hope you know that."</P>
<P>"I do."</P>
<P>"And it’s not like Buffy –"</P>
<P>"I know. I don’t blame either one of you."</P>
<P>"If you’re angry with me, I wish you’d tell me."</P>
<P>"I’m not. I never could be. You went to Buffy. Not some no-name person. She’s special to you."</P>
<P>"She is. But you’ll always be special to me."</P>
<P>"Same here, Will. I hope it works out for you. And…I’m always here if you need anything."</P>
<P>"That offer goes both ways."</P>
<P>Oz smiled.</P>
<P>"I better go stake out the couch before Xander does."</P>
<P>Willow smiled in return, and he kissed her on the cheek.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>When Willow walked back into Buffy’s room, Buffy was in bed, and Cordelia was lying on blankets on the floor. Willow lied down beside Buffy.</P>
<P>"You can keep quiet, huh?" Willow asked Cordelia sarcastically.</P>
<P>"They’re our friends. You were gonna tell them anyway."</P>
<P>"That’s her point, Cordy. We were gonna tell them."</P>
<P>"Well excuse me. Next time you wanna come out of the closet, I’ll keep my mouth shut."</P>
<P>"Cordelia we’re not –" They both started.</P>
<P>"Geez…I was kidding. Take a Prozac or something."</P>
<P>Buffy turned off the light, and tentatively started to put her arm around Willow. She didn’t pull away, so Buffy shifted closer.</P>
<P>They smiled at each other.</P>
<P>"Good night." Buffy said.</P>
<P>"Good night." Willow said, followed by Cordelia.</P>
<P>Their last thoughts as they drifted off to sleep were, <I>‘This is definitely strange, but... it’s a good thing.’</I>/P>
<P>They lived on a Hellmouth. What wasn’t strange?</P>

<p>Buffy and Willow were in Cordelia’s car, holding on, as she drove past Sunnydale’s border. Willow was sitting in the passenger seat; Buffy was in the back.</P>
<p>"Remind me again why we’re driving out of town just to go get Willow’s hair cut." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"Because the only stylist in Sunnydale is in the mall, and everyone who goes there looks like their hair was struck by lightning. Trust me. My hair dresser is the best."</P>
<p>"All I wanted to do was get an inch and a half off." Willow said.</P>
<p>"We’re all agreed that I know fashion right?" Cordelia asked.</P>
<p>"Yep." They both said.</P>
<p>"So I know you would look good with your hair short. Shoulder length with highlights. Besides the cut’s free."</P>
<p>"But –" Willow started to protest.</P>
<p>Buffy put her hand on Willow’s shoulder. Instantly, Willow calmed down.</P>
<p>"If it doesn’t turn out the way you want it to, I’ll knock her out, okay?"</P>
<p>Willow smiled and nodded. Cordelia sighed.</P>
<p>"Xander would never do that for me."</P>
<p>They all started laughing.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy was walking towards her front porch. Cordelia was going to drop Willow off. Willow, to her surprise, was very pleased with her new haircut. She thought it made her look more mature. Buffy couldn’t believe that that was all she said. Laughing slightly, she realized that Willow really didn’t know how beautiful she was.</P>
<p>She was most certainly attractive. Even the first day Buffy saw her at school, she thought Willow was attractive. Of course at the time she didn’t pay it much mind.</p>
<p>Willow’s lack of self-confidence made her feel ugly, so she hid behind clothes that looked something like catholic school uniforms. And Buffy thought that was such a shame. She knew that if Willow had just been less afraid, had just a little more confidence, guys would have been lining up to ask her out. Of course in an ideal world Willow shouldn’t have to change her look to get a date, but Buffy knew two things.</p>
<p>The world wasn’t in any way ideal, and guys were shallow and superficial.</P>
<p>But Willow had grown by leaps and bounds since that first year she had met her. And it might not have been a big deal to Buffy, but she knew that Willow’s new haircut was a big step for her. And Buffy was proud to have been a part of helping her grow. Of being in her life the way she was.</P>
<p>As she opened the door to her house, she felt better than she had in a long time. She had no worries whatsoever. Well, that was until she saw her mom with her arms crossed waiting for her.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Where have you been?" Joyce asked.</P>
<p>Before Buffy responded, she looked out the window.</P>
<p><I>‘Yep, still daylight. So what’d I do now?’</I></P>
<p>"Cordelia and I took Willow to get her hair cut. I was just going to go back out -"</P>
<p>"So you weren’t…slaying?"</P>
<p>"Umm, no. See the sunshine?"</P>
<p>Joyce looked at her daughter, and walked into the kitchen. Buffy, confused, walked after her.</P>
<p>"What’d I say?"</P>
<p>Joyce sighed.</P>
<p>"You just expect me to accept this whole situation and move on?"</P>
<p>"Yeah. I don’t see what’s so hard to understand."</P>
<p>"Well the fact that my seventeen year old daughter has been fighting," Joyce paused, still not believing, "vampires, for the past three years…"</P>
<p>"I get that this is hard for you…"</P>
<p>"I don’t think you get it at all, Buffy. Every night you’ve been risking your life, while I’ve been kept in the dark."</P>
<p>"To prevent conversations like this."</P>
<p>"I am your mother. I’m sorry if you don’t like telling me about your life, but I think I have a right to know."</P>
<p>"I was doing it to protect you. It’s too dangerous if people know. Especially you."</P>
<p>"Then why do your friends know? Aren’t you risking their lives?"</P>
<p>"I didn’t have a choice. They…found out on they’re own. Look, I’m sorry this is hard for you, but no matter how many conversations we have, it doesn’t change what I have to do. I know it’s dangerous, but right now, I’m the only one who can do it."</P>
<p>"What do you mean right now? If there’s a way you can stop, do it."</P>
<p>"You want me to die?"</P>
<p>"What?"</P>
<p>"My death is the only way this is over. So do you want a daughter who is alive and has to worry about saving the world, or a daughter who’s dead and doesn’t have anything to worry about ever again?"</P>
<p>"Oh my God…"</P>
<p>Joyce took Buffy into her arms.</P>
<p>"I’m sorry. I had no idea. I don’t want you to die."</P>
<p>"I didn’t either."</p>
<p>"What?"</P>
<p>"N…nothing."</P>
<p>"It’s just…I don’t know what to say, to do. The school librarian knows you better than I do."</P>
<p>"It’s not his fault. You almost gave him a heart attack. Listen. I’ll try and help you understand what I have to do, but you have to trust me. If you really wanna get to know me, just start paying attention. That’s all I ask."</P>
<p>Joyce wished she could’ve gotten angry at that last remark, but she couldn’t. She knew she hadn’t been that involved in her daughter’s life for a long time now. She hugged her again.</P>
<p>"Do you have any more surprises?"</P>
<p>Buffy quickly thought it over. If she told her now, she was pretty sure her mom would collapse. No, now wasn’t the right time.</P>
<p>"Nope."</P>
<p>"So…do you have any plans tonight?"</P>
<p>"Not really. I was gonna run by Mr. Giles’ house, and then I was going to go meet everybody at the Bronze."</P>
<p>"When you see Mr. Giles, tell him that I’m sorry, and that I’d like to talk with him when he gets time, okay?"</P>
<p>"Sure."</P>
<p>"I was going to rent a movie later. If you want, when you come home, we could, um, watch it…if you want."</P>
<p>"Yeah. That’d be nice."</P>
<p>Buffy smiled at her mom. She started to go out the door, when she realized she forgot supplies.</P>
<p><I>‘Just in case.’</I></P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Giles was sitting on his sofa reading a book and drinking tea. His two favorite things to do. It wasn’t often that he was able to relax, so he intended to take full advantage of it. It had been a difficult summer for him.</P>
<p>There hadn’t been any "dire end of the world" situations. No, summers were usually quiet. He was tortured for hours by Angelus. That was the difficulty. His injuries, by treatment standards, weren’t that extensive. His chest and sides had been bruised, and two fingers were broken. And it all healed pretty well since then.</P>
<p>But the mental stress he endured was hard to get over. Angelus was a definite master of mental torture, and even though Giles had read all about his methods, he wasn’t prepared for it. In fact, one the primary lessons for a Watcher-In-Training was how to survive all types of torture.</P>
<p>And he had been doing well, until Druscilla came into the room. She had used his memories against him. Made him think Jenny was there, and he told her, basically, how to end the world. At that moment, he felt horrible grief. For Jenny, and for Buffy. He had let her down.</P>
<p>He didn’t feel he deserved it, but she had saved him. Sacrificed her love to keep the world turning. When she did that, any anger he had felt towards her for Jenny’s death evaporated. He had even felt guilt for blaming her, and he was prepared to support her in any way that he could.</P>
<p>But surprisingly, he hadn’t needed to. She had been happier than he had ever seen her, and she wouldn’t tell him why. But he enjoyed seeing her happy again, whatever the reason might be.</p>
<p><I>‘She’ll be here any minute.’</I></P>
<p>She had been coming by two nights a week since the beginning of the summer. At first it had been just to check in on any rising demonic activity, but it had become something they both looked forward to. They would just sit and talk about their lives. He would talk about Jenny, his life before a Watcher, and she would talk about her mom, Angel, her dad, and whatever else happened to come up.</P>
<p>It had made them both feel better. They were very similar, and they hadn’t realized it before. There was a knock at the door, and Giles got up and smiled. He opened the door.</P>
<p>"Hey Giles."</P>
<p>"Hello Buffy."</P>
<p>She walked in and sat down, and he shut the door.</P>
<p>"Oh before I forget, my mom says she’s sorry and she wants to talk to you. Without screaming."</P>
<p>"Yes I have to admit I was unprepared for that voice level. I wasn’t aware that it was possible for someone to get that loud. And angry."</P>
<p>"It’s a trait of Summers’ women."</P>
<p>"Yes, and now I know where you get it from."</P>
<p>Buffy smiled, and looked at his hand.</P>
<p>"How are they coming along?"</P>
<p>"Quiet nicely actually. There’s still some discomfort, but in a week or so it should be fine."</P>
<p>"That’s good."</P>
<p>Buffy paled.</P>
<p>"What is it?"</P>
<p>"School starts in a week!"</P>
<p>"Oh, it does doesn’t it?"</P>
<p>Buffy nodded.</P>
<p>"I feel sick."</P>
<p>"I really don’t understand why children have such a strong dislike towards learning."</P>
<p>"Me neither. We just do."</P>
<p>"That reminds me. Stay alert. It has been a quiet summer, but if the vampires follow their pattern, they’ll come out in force for an attack before the start of school."</P>
<p>"Who would have thought vamps have back to school blues? Don’t worry. I brought supplies with me."</P>
<p>"May I ask you a question, Buffy?"</P>
<p>"Sure."</P>
<p>"I’ve noticed you’ve been very cheerful, and I have no idea why. Don’t misunderstand me, I’m glad you’re back to your old self again, but I would have figured…"</P>
<p>"That I would have been mopey?"</P>
<p>"To say the least."</P>
<p>"Well…"</P>
<p>"If you don’t wish to –"</P>
<p>"No, there’s no reason for me not to. It’s not bad or anything. At first, though, I was mopey. I was going to leave, live on my own, but I didn’t."</P>
<p>Giles was shocked. In all their talks they had had over the summer, this had never come up.</P>
<p>"But two things stopped me. One – Angel."</P>
<p>"Angel?"</P>
<p>"I don’t know how to explain it, but he came to me just as I was ready to leave. He said he wasn’t in Hell, he was upstairs."</P>
<p>"Upstairs?" He thought a moment. "Oh, upstairs."</P>
<p>"He said that he was okay, told me not to feel guilty, and convinced me to stay."</P>
<p>"And the second thing?"</P>
<p>"Willow."</P>
<p>Giles showed his confusion.</P>
<p>"I realized something when she was in the hospital."</P>
<p>"Oh?"</P>
<p>"I love her."</P>
<p>Giles let it sink in, and then he smiled. He saw Buffy waiting for his reaction.</P>
<p>"I’m not surprised."</P>
<p>"You’re not?"</P>
<p>"Should I be?"</P>
<p>"Well, it’s kind of a change for me. I thought you would’ve had a stronger reaction."</P>
<p>"I believe that if you have found love, same gender or no, and you’re happy, my only reaction is happiness for you and Willow. Have you told your mother?"</P>
<p>"Giles, think about that."</P>
<p>"Yes, that would probably be a bad idea. But both you and Willow have laid a foundation of friendship that helped you get to this point. I’ve seen you two both help each other and grow closer. I’d think your mother would be accepting of this."</P>
<p>"Well it is Willow. How could you not accept her? But there’s also my choice in relationships. A vampire, and now another girl. And considering she still can’t deal with Angel…"</P>
<p>"I’d think she’d be pleased you had a relationship with a human being."</P>
<p>"Very funny, Giles."</P>
<p>"I try."</P>
<p>"Well I have to book. I’m meeting the gang at the Bronze."</P>
<p>"If there’s any trouble –"</P>
<p>"I’ll send one of the guys to come get you.  Thanks, Giles."</P>
<p>"You’re welcome. And congratulations."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"Guess what?" Buffy asked the gang around the table at the Bronze. Greeted with blank stares, she told them. "School starts in a week!"</P>
<p>A collective groan was heard.</P>
<p>"I’m looking forward to it." Willow said.</P>
<p>"You always look forward to it, Will." Xander said.</P>
<p>"Yeah everybody knows you’re the teenage version of Giles." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>"I’m serious. We’ll be seniors. The kings, or in my gender’s case, queens, of the school."</P>
<p>"Yeah. You’ve got the look for it too." Oz said.</P>
<p>"Love the new do." Xander said.</P>
<p>"Told you." Buffy whispered to Willow.</P>
<p>Willow blushed.</P>
<p>"Wanna dance?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"You bet." Buffy responded.</P>
<p>Willow had butterflies in her stomach as she and Buffy walked out to the dance area. It was a slow song, and they were going to be with other couples. Male/female couples.</P>
<p>They regarded one another a moment and then Willow put her arms around Buffy’s neck, and Buffy put her arms around Willow’s. To Willow’s surprise, no one seemed to pay much attention to them. She didn’t know if that was because it didn’t bother them or if they were afraid of what Buffy would do to them, but she didn’t care.</P>
<p>She relaxed, and smiled.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Back at the table, the gang just watched Buffy and Willow dance.</P>
<p>"They sure are happy." Oz said.</P>
<p>"Especially Buffy. I haven’t seen her this happy since –" Xander started.</P>
<p>"Well, it’s gotta be nice when you’re in a relationship where your partner isn’t a demon. Kind of eliminates the fear aspect. Plus, there’re no secrets. They know each other." Oz said.</P>
<p>"And Angel had lots of secrets." Xander said.</P>
<p>"Plus a tendency toward rage and viol ence. I never could figure out why you two couldn’t get along, Xander." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>"What’s that supposed to mean?"</P>
<p>"Nothing."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"So you really like the hair?"</P>
<p>"For the last time, yes. You’re beautiful."</P>
<p>Willow blushed. She looked at Buffy, who seemed concerned about something.</P>
<p>"Buffy?"</P>
<p>"What? Oh. Sorry. I had an exhausting argument with mom earlier. But I think we’re getting better."</P>
<p>"It wasn’t about us, was it?"</P>
<p>"No, I’m trying to avoid that as long as possible. Have you -?"</P>
<p>"Are you kidding? No way. I like the way things are now. Once I tell my parents, it’ll complicate things."</P>
<p>"Ain’t that the truth."</P>
<P>Buffy looked over to her right, and pulled Willow closer.</P>
<p>"Vamp, 3:00 o’clock. Act natural."</P>
<p>"This is natural to you?" Willow smiled.</P>
<p>"The most natural thing in the world. Let’s start moving over to the table."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>The gang looked at Buffy and Willow as they ‘danced’ back towards the table. Willow’s back was to them, but they could see Buffy. She mouthed, ‘vampire’, and they all nodded. It was about to get messy.</P>
<p>As they heard the vampire growl, they started to get up to open the doors.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>When Buffy and Willow heard the vampire growl, they pulled apart.</P>
<p>"Get to the others and help them ge t t he other people out."</P>
<p>"But…"</P>
<p>"Go. I’ll be okay. I promise."</P>
<p>Willow nodded reluctantly, as a rush of people came running by. Buffy turned around to face the vampire, and pulled a stake out of her jacket.</P>
<p>"You’re it?" She asked.</P>
<p>"Not quite."</P>
<p>As the vampire said that, six of his buddies dropped down onto the stage.</P>
<p><I>‘Damn. I forgot about the skylight in the roof.’</I></P>
<p>"Let’s go, Slayer."</P>
<p>"You know what I hate?" Buffy said as she round-housed the vampire in the head, "Being rushed." The vampire fell, and Buffy looked to the stage. The three members of the night’s band were struggling against the six vampires who were trying to get a snack.</P>
<p>She ran up to the stage, and grabbed the vampire nearest to her. She threw him off the stage, and directly into the vampire she had knocked down a minute ago. Buffy quickly surveyed the situation. Everyone but the band was out of the Bronze. That was good.</P>
<p>Noticing the absence of their friend, the other five vampires focused their attention on Buffy.</p>
<p>"Get out!" She yelled to the three guys huddled in the corner.</P>
<p>Not needing to be told twice, they ran backstage, and out the back door. Now Buffy was alone. With seven angry vampires, and an even less number of stakes.</P>
<p>"Okay. Now what?"</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Outside of the Bronze, the last of the people that were inside, were running home. Willow didn’t like Buffy’s chances.</P>
<p>"Go get Giles." She said. "I’m going back in."</P>
<p>"You could – Oz and I will go in. You go with Cordy and get Giles." Xander said.</P>
<p>"Go get Giles." Willow said evenly.</P>
<p>That was the end of the discussion. Willow picked up a pole that was lying against the side of building, and opened the side door.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy rammed her stake right through the vampire closest to her.</p>
<p><I>‘Six to go. Why’d I forget Mr. Pointy?’</I></P>
<p>She leaped over her enemies, and back down to the ground. She grabbed a cue off of a pool table, and slammed it into the oncoming vampire. She jumped on top of the pool table to get higher as the five who were left started to surround her.</P>
<p>She kicked them down.</P>
<p><I>‘As fun as this is, I really need a more permanent solution.’</I></P>
<p>From behind her she heard a door open. She turned around just in time to see Willow toss her a long, metal pole. It might just keep them off her long enough for her to get out. As she hopped down off the table, she connected with the pole on the top of a female one’s head. It dropped.</P>
<p>Buffy suddenly remembered the stake hidden in her sleeve, took it out, and dusted the she-vamp before it could get up. She swung the pole like a bat, momentarily knocking all the vampires down. She ran towards the door and Willow.</P>
<p>"What are you doing here?" Buffy panted.</P>
<p>"Helping you."</P>
<p>"Thanks."</P>
<p>"I sent the guys to get Giles. He should be here with more weapons." Willow said as she tried the door.</P>
<p>"What is it?"</P>
<p>"It’s stuck."</P>
<p>Buffy looked at the vampires approaching, and handed Willow the pole. She started kicking the door. Willow remembered something.</P>
<p>"Ooh! I have holywater." She said reaching into her pants pocket.</P>
<p>"Use it!"</P>
<p>Just as Willow threw the bottle at the vampires, the door slammed open. Buffy grabbed Willow by the hand, and they ran outside.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>As soon as they emerged from the Bronze, they saw Giles and their friends. Giles had a crossbow, and Mr. Pointy. Two vampires came running out first, and Giles aimed. It sliced through both, turning them to ashes. He handed Buffy Mr. Pointy, and she ran to the door.</P>
<p>Standing to the left of the door, she waited until the last two came out. They came out one by one this time. She pulled the first one off to the side, and dispatched him quickly. The other one was a little bit smarter, and was able to knock Buffy off her feet.</P>
<p>The gang rushed over. Willow got there first, and pulled the vampire back. As the vampire turned on her, Buffy shot up from behind and grabbed it by the neck. She tossed Mr. Pointy to Willow.</P>
<p>"Would you like to do the honors, Will?"</P>
<p>Willow grinned, and with dead on accuracy, staked the vampire. Buffy hugged Willow immediately.</P>
<p>"Thanks for saving my life in there."</P>
<p>"I didn’t –"</P>
<p>"Yes you did. I’d be dead if it wasn’t for you."</P>
<p>Buffy turned to Giles.	</P>
<p>"Don’t you hate being right?"</P>
<p>"Yes, actually."</P>
<p>They all started to walk home.</P>
<p>"I’d say that this unofficially marks the end of summer." Xander said.</P>
<p>"I’d have to agree with you, Xand. I’d say we’re in for another horror-filled school year." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"But at least it’ll be the last horror-filled school year." Willow said optimistically.</P>
<p>Buffy moved closer to Willow. God, she loved her optimism.</P>
<p>"True." Oz said.</P>
<p>"It really doesn’t mean anything though. After this it’s on to horror-filled college years." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>Everybody frowned.</P>
<p>"And once again you manage to destroy the silver lining in the cloud, Cordelia." Giles said.</P>
<p>Cordelia looked at him unbelievingly, and everyone laughed.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy told Willow that she and her mom were going to watch a movie at her house, and invited her to watch it with them. By the time they all settled down on the couch to watch it, it was late, but they tried to keep their eyes open.</P>
<p>About half- way through, Buffy and Willow were sound asleep on the couch, Buffy’s head on the end of the sofa, and Willow’s head on Buffy’s shoulder. Her arm was draped around Willow’s body.</p>
<p>Joyce looked over at them from the chair she was sitting in, and smiled. She got up, and put a blanket around them. She shut off the TV, and started to go upstairs. Halfway up, she turned around and looked down at them.</P>
<p>"She’ll tell me when she’s ready."</P>
<p>With that, Joyce went to bed.</P>

<p>Buffy woke up the next morning with a smile on her face. She had forgotten how good it felt to smile. She dipped her head down. Her arm was wrapped around Willow, and Willow’s head was on her shoulder. She was still asleep. Buffy smiled again.</P>
<p>Carefully she propped herself up and looked at the blanket that was covering them.</P>
<p><I>‘That wasn’t there last night…mom! Does she know?’</I></P>
<p>She heard noise in the kitchen. Quietly, and reluctantly, she got untangled from her position on the couch. She stood up, and covered Willow again with the blanket. She kissed Willow’s hair, and walked into the kitchen.</P>
<p>Her mom was making breakfast.</P>
<p>"Hi honey. I didn’t wake you did I?"</P>
<p>"Nope. I was up."</P>
<p>"Do you want some breakfast?"</P>
<p>"Yeah. Smells good."</P>
<p>"How about Willow?"</P>
<p>"Still asleep. I didn’t want to wake her."</P>
<p>For a few seconds they didn’t speak.</P>
<p>"Did…did you cover us last night?"</P>
<p>"You two looked so peaceful."</P>
<p>Buffy didn’t know what to say.</P>
<p>"You care for her don’t you?"</P>
<p>"How’d you know?"</P>
<p>"I paid attention."</P>
<p>Buffy smiled.</P>
<p>"So…what happens now?"</P>
<p>"It’s your life. At least this is something I can handle. I can be here for you. This is more normal than demons. "</P>
<p>"You’re not going to pass out on me?"</P>
<p>"Did you want me to?"</P>
<p>Buffy laughed.</P>
<p>"Willow’s nice. And I’ve never seen you this happy before. Why would I not be okay?"</P>
<p>Buffy hugged her mom.</P>
<p>"Breakfast is ready."</P>
<p>"Okay. I…just remembered something. I’ll be right down."</P>
<p>Buffy ran upstairs to her room. She opened the top drawer of the bureau that was by her bed. She looked at the two Claddgah rings that were inside for a moment, and shut the drawer. She got an idea.</P>
<I><P>‘I need to think.’</P>
</I><P>She walked into her mom’s room and saw the mask her mom got from the Gallery on the wall.</P>
<I><P>‘Scary.’</P>
</I><P>She left the room. As she was coming downstairs, she saw Willow walking towards the kitchen, yawning.</P>
<p>"Look who’s up."</P>
<p>"Morning, Buffy." She smiled. </P>
<p>"Mom’s got breakfast ready. Do you want?"</P>
<p>Willow nodded, and they went into the dining room. Later, while they were eating, Buffy brought up the mask.</P>
<p>"That mask is really creepy, mom."</P>
<p>"It’s priceless. I just wish I knew more about it."</P>
<p>"You could ask Giles." </P>
<p>"Yeah. He’s really good with artifacts and stuff." Willow said.</P>
<p>"Maybe I will."</P>
<P>Joyce looked at the two of them.</P>
<P>"You take good care of my daughter, Willow."</P>
<p>Willow looked at Buffy. She looked back, telling her, <I>‘It’s okay. She knows.’ </I>She looked at Joyce.</P>
<p>"Don’t worry, Mrs. Summers. We’re good at taking care of each other."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>The last week before school passed by uneventfully, and now Willow was walking through the halls of Sunnydale High starting her senior year. She was making her way to her chemistry class.</P>
<p>Everyone was staring at her. She could hear people snickering quietly.</P>
<p><I>‘Well now I know the whole student body knows.’</I></P>
<p>She breathed a sigh of relief, when she reached the classroom. She made her way to a lab table, and sat next to Buffy. Cordelia and Xander were sitting behind them. Buffy saw the expression on her face.</P>
<p>"You too, huh?"</P>
<p>Willow nodded.</P>
<p>"Don’t listen to them."</P>
<p>Harmony and one of her friends were sitting the next aisle over.</P>
<p>"I don’t know why I’m surprised. They’re already weird. This is probably nothing to them." Harmony whispered.</P>
<p>Willow saw Buffy’s anger building.</P>
<p>"Don’t, Buffy." She said softly.</P>
<p>"So Willow, how long have you been keeping this a secret? I thought you just were too brainy to go out with guys. I had no idea you were, you know. So what’s it like? Having to kiss a girl cause no guy would ever go near you. " Harmony said with too much joy.</P>
<p>Cordelia leaned over to get closer to Harmony.</P>
<p>"Why are you asking, Harmony? You already know what it’s like." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>Harmony went wide-eyed.</P>
<p>"What are you talking about?"</P>
<p>"Don’t play dumb. Oh wait, you are. Eight grade, Jodie Keeler’s fourteenth –"</P>
<p>"You wouldn’t." Harmony whispered.</P>
<p>"Try me. In two minutes, nobody in the senior class will ever go near you again."</P>
<p>The teacher walked in, and Harmony pretended to be writing in her notebook.</P>
<p>"Way to go, Cordy." Xander said.</P>
<p>"Yeah, thanks." Buffy said.</P>
<p>Willow managed a weak smile for Cordelia’s benefit, and looked down at the table.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>After class, they all went to the library. Willow led the pack, and sat on the steps. Buffy followed closely behind, and sat next to her. Willow was crying softly, and Buffy wrapped her arms around her. Giles walked over.</P>
<p>"Is everything all right?" He asked.</P>
<p>Buffy looked up at him.</P>
<p>"Word got around."</P>
<p>"Oh." He paused, unsure of what to say. "I’ll be…" Giles pointed to the office, and Buffy nodded.</P>
<p>"I’m sorry, Buffy. I got your shirt all wet." Willow said, sniffing.</P>
<p>Buffy chuckled softly.</P>
<p>"It’s okay, Will. They really got to you, didn’t they?"</P>
<p>"I’m used to being ignored, and now when people finally talk to me, all they do is hurt me."</P>
<p>"You wanna hear my other philosophy?"</P>
<p>"Besides ‘Life is Short’? Yeah, I do."</P>
<p>"Ignore anyone and everyone who tries to make you feel bad. Because they just like to hurt you because it makes them feel like a bigger person then they actually are."</P>
<p>"So basically, ‘Screw them’."</P>
<p>"Okay, so your term was a little more direct."</P>
<p>Willow smiled slightly, but began to worry again.</P>
<p>"But what if word gets around to Principal Snyder? He could tell my parents, and…"</P>
<p>"Snyder can’t do anything. And if he does somehow get word to your parents, I’ll be there to back you up."</P>
<p>Willow smiled, and they noticed the rest of the gang behind them.</P>
<p>"Oh, hi guys. Didn’t see you there." Buffy said.</P>
<p>They all grinned.</P>
<p>Buffy helped Willow stand up, and Giles came out of the office.</P>
<p>"Oh. I almost forgot. Mom invited everyone over for dinner tonight. You too, Giles. So it would make me extremely happy if you said there was no big evil I had to fight tonight."</P>
<p>"Buffy, there is no big evil you have to fight tonight." Giles said.</P>
<p>"Wow. I wasn’t expecting that answer. Yay!"</P>
<p>Willow walked over to Cordelia.</P>
<p>"Thanks for what you said in class, Cordy. You didn’t have to."</P>
<p>"I’m sorry you had to go through that. Don’t ever listen to what Harmony says, okay?"</P>
<p>Willow nodded. Cordelia really was one of them now.</P>
<p>"Was I really like her?"</P>
<p>They all nodded.</P>
<p>"Why didn’t you shoot me?"</P>
<p>"Believe me, we wanted to." Xander quipped.</P>
<p>He got a playful slap on the arm, and they settled into meaningless conversation.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy had been debating what to do for a little over a week now. She could see Willow’s uncertainty, and she knew that this would help both of them. She had a half an hour before her daily workout at the library, so she had to make this quick.</P>
<p>She made her way into the jewelry store, and spotted the item she wanted. In case Willow didn’t know how much she meant to her, this would create a bond between them, so that no matter what, they’d always stick together.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Joyce had a chicken in the oven. It was four-thirty, so it would be done in another hour. Just in time for when everybody was going to show up. There was knock at the door. Checking the progress of dinner, she then made her way to the foyer.</P>
<p><I>‘Probably one of the kids.’</I></P>
<p>Needless to say, she was surprised when she opened the door.</P>
<p>"Mr. Giles."</P>
<p>"Hello, Joyce."</P>
<p>After several seconds of silence, she realized he was still standing outside.</P>
<p>"Please…come in."</P>
<p>"Thank you."</P>
<p>He came in and shut the door behind him.</P>
<p>"Buffy’s okay, isn’t she?" Joyce asked, suddenly wondering why he was here so early.</P>
<p>"Yes, she’s fine. She’s with everyone in the library. She’s exercising, and she has time and time again told me it was unnecessary for me to be there during aerobics. Plus her taste in music while she works out is not exactly my style."</P>
<p>"I’ll agree with you on that."</P>
<p>"I figured if I came by early we could talk."</P>
<p>"That would help me get back in daughter’s life."</P>
<p>She didn’t say it directly, but he knew she meant, <I>‘You’ve been guiding my daughter for the past three years, and now I’d like a part of it.’</I></P>
<p>"Where would you like to start?"</P>
<p>"Why her?"</P>
<p>"Well, that’s difficult question to answer. One girl in all the world, one born with –"</P>
<p>"Buffy gave me that already, and it doesn’t answer my question."</P>
<p>"Nobody truly knows how Slayers are chosen. I was taught that it was fate. If you believe in that sort of thing of course."</P>
<p>"Fate or not, she’s seventeen years old. How can you be okay with her risking her life every single night?"</P>
<p>"Believe me, Joyce. There are times that I wished that Buffy did not have to do her duty, and all I’ve wanted to do is protect her. But she is very capable, and very committed. However, like her, I did not have a choice in my career.</P>
<p>"I became a Watcher. And I have guided many Slayers, but Buffy is the most skilled by far. I can only promise you that I will do whatever I can, whenever possible, to make sure she comes back home safe to you every day."</P>
<p>Joyce took a deep breath.</P>
<p>"Has she really saved the world?"</P>
<p>"Three times actually. And it pained her not to be able to tell you all of this, but it’s a primary code that Slayers must follow. It’s for the parents’ safety, and now that I think about it, it’s the only code she’s ever followed.</P>
<p>"She has kept you unaware of her situation not to push you away, but to keep you safe. I hope you realize that."</P>
<p>"I do, I just feel terrible. All those times I grounded her for fighting…yelled at her…"</P>
<p>"She doesn’t blame you. She has used the fact that she was grounded, many times, to get out of training. So in some cases, she was glad to be confined to her room."</P>
<p>She laughed.</P>
<p>"Buffy tells me you're somewhat of an expert on relics and things." Joyce said, changing the subject. For the moment, she was okay with everything.</P>
<p>"Somewhat, yes. Why?"</P>
<p>"I’d like to get your opinion on something."</P>
<p>Joyce started to walk upstairs, and Giles followed behind. They entered her bedroom, and Giles quickly found an odd looking mask hanging on the wall.</P>
<p>"We got a very exciting shipment in at the Gallery. I thought I'd hang this piece in here. It cheers up the room." She said.</P>
<p>"It's, striking…and Nigerian."</P>
<p>"Oh. Yes. I have this wonderful dealer who specializes in ancient artifacts, I don't know if you..."</P>
<p>"This seems awfully familiar. I think I’ll call Willow at the library. Oh, may use your phone?"</P>
<p>"Of course."</P>
<p>As Giles was dialing the number, they heard a shout from downstairs.</P>
<p>"We’re here!" Buffy yelled.</P>
<p>Giles placed the phone back down. "Figures."</P>
<p>He and Joyce went back downstairs.</P>
<p>"What are you doing back so early?" Giles asked Buffy.</P>
<p>"Early?"</P>
<p>"You can’t expect me to believe you got a workout after twenty minutes."</P>
<p>"Hey, I broke a sweat. In my book, that means I worked out. The guys can vouch for me."</P>
<p>They looked up at the gang.</P>
<p>"Can’t you?" Buffy asked, eyeing them.</P>
<p>"Oh yeah. She was…lots of sweat…real stinky…worked hard…" They all spoke together, jumbling their words. </P>
<p>"There, you see? Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to get a shower." Buffy said.</P>
<p>Buffy went upstairs, leaving Joyce and Giles sighing.</P>
<p>"Kids." They both said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy dropped her bag to the floor, and then went and got a shower. Before she went downstairs, she grabbed the object she purchased off the top of her desk, and put it in her pants pocket. She knew what she was going to do.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Dinner was nice and relaxing. The conversation was normal, and best of all, tension free.</P>
<p>"Mrs. Summers, this great. I haven’t eaten food this good since…well I’ve never eaten food this good." Xander said.</P>
<p>"Thank you, Xander."</P>
<p>"Yeah not even the cook at my house makes food this good." Cordelia said.</P>
<p>They all looked at her.</P>
<p>"What?"</P>
<p>"Well, not everyone has their own cook." Oz said.</P>
<p>"He’s not my cook, he’s the family cook. And I wasn’t saying that to sound snotty, I was just stating a fact."</P>
<p>"Well, thank you for the compliment. Who wants to do the dishes?"</P>
<p>Nobody moved, and then Willow jumped up.</P>
<p>"Thank you, Willow."</P>
<p>Willow stared at Buffy. Buffy stood up.</P>
<p>"I’ll help you."</P>
<p>"See? She’s a good influence on you." Joyce said.</P>
<p>"I know. Isn’t it horrible?" Buffy said playfully.</P>
<p>Willow swatted her, and they made their way to the kitchen.</P>


<hr width=100>

<p>Upstairs, in Joyce’s bedroom, a red light was shining on the door. It was coming from the mask hanging on the opposite wall. Its eyes were glowing red.</P>

<hr width=100>


<p>Buffy and Willow were washing dishes in the sink. Well actually, Buffy was washing and Willow was drying.</P>
<p>"See? This isn’t so bad, is it?"</P>
<p>"No, it’s just really dull."</P>
<p>"Okay, maybe it is." Willow laughed.</P>
<p>"You’re really okay, right?"</P>
<p>"It’ll take a little while to get used to everybody, but…"</P>
<p>"Hey, I’ve had years to deal with people saying things behind my back, I’ll help you deal too."</P>
<p>"Thanks."</P>
<p>Willow kissed her.</P>
<p>"Listen, Will…there’s something I want to…"</P>
<p>"Buffy, I have…"</P>
<P>They were interrupted by a scream.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>They ran into the living room.</P>
<p>"Is everyone okay?"</P>
<p>"Yeah. It came from outside." Oz said.</P>
<p>Xander opened the door, and saw people running away from people who looked very dead. And a whole group of them, twenty or more were heading right for the house.</P>
<p>"We won’t be okay for long." He said.</P>
<p>"What are you talking about?" Cordelia asked. She looked out the door, and screamed.</P>
<p>The zombies started crashing right through the window.</P>
<p>"What do we do?" Joyce asked.</P>
<p>"Go out the back!" Buffy yelled.</P>
<p>Oz ran ahead. As the zombies came right through the back door, he ran back to the  gr   oup.</P>
<p>"It’s no good. They’re back there too." He said.</P>
<p>Three zombies started to go upstairs, ignoring the group, and the rest started to surround them.</P>
<p>"Why are they going upstairs?" Buffy asked, kicking one in the chest. It staggered, but came forward still.</P>
<p>"The mask!" Giles yelled.</P>
<p>"What?"</P>
<p>"I thought I recognized your mother’s mask. That’s what they’re after!"</P>
<p>"I didn’t know the undead were so into art." Xander said, knocking one off its feet momentarily. Willow was huddled over Joyce, trying to protect her.</P>
<p>"The mask holds the power of a... zombie demon, called Ovu Mobani -Evil Eye. I don't think we can get past them." Giles said.</P>
<p>"Well, what happens if they get the mask?" Oz asked.</P>
<P>"If one of them puts it on, they become the demon incarnate."</P>
<P>"Oz, help me clear a path to the stairs. Then you and Giles take everyone upstairs and stop them from getting the mask. Hurry! They’re almost up!"</P>
<P>Oz grabbed a potted plant that was against the wall and smashed it over a zombie’s head. It fell. Buffy grabbed one by the neck, and pushed it into one of his buddies.</P>
<P>"Come on!" Xander yelled leading everyone to the stairs. They all followed, and saw two of the three zombies that went up, still on the stairs.</P>
<P>"Buff, I need a weapon!" Xander yelled.</P>
<P>Buffy ripped a post off the railing, and tossed it to him.</P>
<P>Xander and Oz charged up the stairs. Xander swung at one, making him tumble down the steps, and Oz elbowed the other one. They made it to the bedroom just as the zombie was putting on the mask.</P>
<P>"Oh dear." Giles said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>The zombie turned around. The mask was on. Willow, who had her arm protectively around Joyce, caught the thing’s gaze.</P>
<P>"Willow, don’t look into it’s eyes!" Giles yelled.</P>
<P>But it was too late. There was a bright flash, and then Willow collapsed to the ground unconscious. Oz and Xander grabbed the zombie by its arms, and shoved it out the window. It rolled down the roof, and fell to the ground.</P>
<P>Giles and Joyce crouched around Willow.</P>
<P>"I’ll go get Buffy." Oz said running out the door.</P>
<P>"Tell Buffy Mobani's power lies in his eyes! She has to go for the eyes to defeat him!"</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Downstairs, Buffy heard the crash and thump of the thing outside. She knew something had happened to Willow. She could feel it. Stepping on the back of a zombie, she just knocked down, she jumped up on the coffee table, and over the group of zombies threatening to overtake her. She ran out the front door.</P>
<P>She got to her porch, and saw a shovel leaning against the front of the house. She grabbed it, and ran into the yard. The zombie’s back was to her.</P>
<P>"Hey Buffy!" She heard Oz call.</P>
<P>The thing turned around. She saw his eyes glowing.</P>
<P>"Something tells me I don’t wanna look into those."</P>
<P>She lifted the shovel up, and the thing started to lock gazes with her. Shaking it off, she pulled her arm back.</P>
<P>"Hey you!" She tossed the shovel right into its eyes. It collapsed, and in a blinding light, vanished. "Made you look."</P>
<P>As she turned to go back into the house, she saw Oz.</P>
<P>"Never mind." He said.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>As Buffy and Oz came in, Giles was carrying Willow down the stairs. Buffy rushed over.</P>
<P>"Is she okay?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>"She’ll be fine, honey." Joyce said.</P>
<P>They laid her on the sofa, and Cordelia came from the kitchen holding a cup. She splashed Willow’s face with water. Willow stirred, and started to cough. Buffy held her head. Buffy gave Cordelia a look.</P>
<P>"What? It worked didn’t it?" Cordelia asked.</P>
<P>Buffy sighed.</P>
<P>"Yeah it did. Thanks."</P>
<P>Cordelia smiled.</P>
<P>"You okay, Will?" Buffy asked.</P>
<P>"I think I have a headache."</P>
<P>"I’m on aspirin duty." Oz said.</P>
<P>"Well I’d say, ‘This house is clear’." Xander said.</P>
<P>"That was the worst –" Willow said.</P>
<P>"Hey, I just got attacked by zombies. Give me a break!"</P>
<P>Oz came in with two aspirin and another cup of water. He handed them to Willow.</P>
<P>"So, is this a typical day at the office?" Joyce asked.</P>
<P>"No. This was nothing." Buffy responded.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>They cleaned up as best they could, and all said good night. Buffy asked Willow to stay a few extra minutes, and they went up to her room. When they sat on the floor, Buffy took a deep breath, and spoke.</P>
<P>"After what almost happened tonight, I don’t want to go another second without giving you one of these." Buffy said, pulling a golden Claddgah ring out of her pocket.</P>
<P> Willow looked at it, and smiled. She pulled out a ring as well.</P>
<P>"When did you –"</P>
<P>"After we dropped you off after getting my haircut, I asked Cordy to run by the jewelry store. I picked it out. Looks like you did the same thing."</P>
<P>"I wanted to give you something special…" Buffy took the silver Claddgah rings out of her bureau. "…And move on from these."</P>
<P>"Those are the rings you and Angel shared."</P>
<P>Buffy nodded. "When he turned, I was sure he would have crushed his, but after destroying the Judge, I went back to his apartment. He had cleared all his stuff out, but his ring was still sitting on top of the dresser. I took it, and I’ve had it ever since."</P>
<P>Buffy set the silver rings down between them, and started to slip her gold ring on Willow’s finger.</P>
<P>"It’s time I stopped holding on to the past. I’m committing myself to you for as long as you’ll have me."</P>
<P>Tears were rolling down both their faces, as Willow started to put her ring on Buffy’s finger.</P>
<P>"The hands represent friendship," Willow started. </P>
<P>"The crown represents loyalty," Buffy continued.</P>
<P>Finishing the final symbol together, "And the heart, represents love." </P>
<P>As the ring was situated on Buffy’s finger, the rings seemed to glow. And the silver ones vanished in the gold light.</P>
<P>"I'll always be here with you. Like you will be for me." Willow said.</P>
<P>Buffy nodded and Willow crushed her in a hug. They kissed softly, and an unbreakable bond was created.</P>

</table>

<P>It finally happened. Things had been going great for almost two weeks, and then a couple students told Principal Snyder about her and Buffy. She didn’t know who told him, but that wasn’t really important to her right now. Because now, they were sitting in his office getting a speech about how it was inappropriate, or something like that. At some point, she and Buffy had grasped hands. </P>
<P>Buffy had told her that he talked for a long time, so Willow let her thoughts wander. She knew where Snyder was coming from, although she completely disagreed with him. He was a man who believed in order. He liked a well-structured society. And in society gays and lesbians just didn’t seem to mix with straight people, so that carried over to school.</P>
<P>But she didn’t consider herself lesbian, although she knew technically she was. It wasn’t that she was in denial, or that she was ashamed to be in love with Buffy. She just thought it was wrong having to be labeled and stuck into a group. To lose herself. She was Willow Rosenberg. That was her name, her identity, but everybody who looked at her thought and saw one thing: ‘lesbian’. </P>
<P> It bothered her to say the least. She had learned to slowly deal with other kids remarks, but the thing was, she knew it didn’t stop when school was over. Adults acted the same way as their kids. Maybe they didn’t approach you and make comments, but they stared at you. She dreaded that day. The day when she was more afraid of people in daylight, then the vampires at night. It’s not like she shouted out over the rooftops that she was in love with her best friend, but she would always look over her shoulder. </P>
<P>The whole categorizing thing was wrong to her. Very wrong. She was pretty sure that before gays were that widely talked about people who were in a male/female relationship weren’t called straight. It was all a big mess. Because gays were just as responsible for the categorizing as the straight people. Like they wanted to separate. Well, Willow told herself she wasn’t going to be sucked in by either group. She would be her, and that’s it. It had gotten her this far.</P>
<P>Gay, straight, or bisexual, they were all people first, right? To make friends now, she didn’t want to have to go up to someone and warn them, ‘I’m a lesbian’. Of course if she didn’t, then she got to know the person, and then told, it would create a problem. She just didn’t get it. What was so wrong? People should be happy for anybody who’s found love, no matter what the couple is like. It was just frustrating.</P>
<I><P>‘Oh well. I think too much anyway.’</P>
</I><P>She focused her attention back on Snyder.</P>
<P>"You can’t do anything. That would be discrimination, and we can sue you for it." Buffy said.</P>
<p>"Unfortunately, you’re correct. But in case you don’t know the rules, in my school, you’re not allowed to show any physical affection."</P>
<p>"We haven’t done anything like that."</P>
<p>Willow saw the look in Buffy’s eyes. She wished they could. But again, even though society had no specific law against it, they were pressured by the masses to not show affection in public. Willow sighed.</P>
<p>Snyder pointed to their held hands.</P>
<p>"That’s a sign of friendly support. It’s for when you’re –" Buffy had a remark all set to go, but thought better of it.</P>
<p>"It’s an easy to follow rule."</P>
<p>Buffy glared at him, and started to pull her hand out of Willow’s. Willow decided to make a decision then and there. She gripped Buffy’s hand tighter.</P>
<p>"No." She said simply.</P>
<p>Snyder and Buffy both looked at her like she had grown an extra head. Willow grinned inwardly.</P>
<p>"Buffy’s right. It’s just a gesture of support. It’s not like were kissing in the hallways."</P>
<p>Snyder grinned.</P>
<p>"Well, Miss Summers, I didn’t think it possible, but you finally corrupted our best student. Such a shame."</P>
<p>"She didn’t corrupt –"</P>
<p>"Miss Rosenberg, normally I would take great pleasure in discipline, but because this is your first offense I’ll be lenient, and leave that to your parents. In this case, I think they could do a much better job than I ever could."</P>
<p>Willow paled.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Buffy and Willow came out of Snyder’s office, and started making their way to the cafeteria.</P>
<p>"He kept us in there for a whole hour? I missed two classes!" Willow said, fuming.</P>
<p>Buffy chuckled. "You can get the notes from somebody."</P>
<p>"No I can’t. I’m the only one who takes notes. I’m the one people come to for the notes."</P>
<p>"I think you’re just avoiding what he said." Buffy told her gently.</P>
<p>"About him telling my parents? I knew it was going to happen sooner or later. It’ll be okay."</P>
<p>"Willow I can see your face. It’s not an okay face. It’s a ‘I’m pretty sure my parents will blow up and probably disown me’ face."</P>
<p>"You can tell? I thought I was hiding it pretty well."</P>
<p>"I can tell you were trying real hard, though."</P>
<p>Willow smiled weakly.</P>
<p>"Do you want me to come home with you after school?"</P>
<p>"I don’t think you want to do that. You may be super strong and all, but when my father gets mad…"</P>
<p>"If you’re sure that’s what you want."</P>
<p>"For now it is. I have to deal with my parents. It’s gonna be hard, and it probably won’t go very well, considering how religious my family is and stuff, but I need to do this solo."</P>
<p>They entered the cafeteria and went in the line.</P>
<p>"Just remember that if you need me, I’ll rush right over." Buffy smiled at her.</P>
<p>"I will." Willow smiled back.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Willow flung the duffel bag over her shoulder, looked back at her house, and then walked away. It was just starting to get dark, so she sped up a little. She knew it would go bad, but she never thought it would go this far.</P>
<p>Her father kicked her out. She didn’t think it was possible to hurt as much as she was. The one time she did something they didn’t agree with…she couldn’t believe her father would do that to her.</P>
<p>She kept playing the ‘argument’ back in her mind. She came home, and as soon as she was through the door, the first question was, ‘Is it true?’ Of course, she answered truthfully. She figured if she was honest with them, it would go better. It didn’t.</P>
<p>Her mother, in her infinite knowledge, immediately suggested that she would get her some help. That’s when Willow started yelling defensively, surprising both herself and her mother. Her mother responded by calling Buffy a ‘bad influence’ and ‘trouble’, and that Willow was not to have any more contact with her.</P>
<p>Up until that point, her father had been silent. Calmly, he sat her down, and said he understood what was going on. She was confused, and it was natural for girl her age to be unsure. Then he brought up what she knew was coming all along. Their religion.</P>
<p>Ahead of her on the sidewalk, a vampire jumped out in front of her. Too busy with her own thoughts, she stood there a minute, then spoke.</P>
<p>In an angry voice she said, "Not now." She shoved the vampire as hard as she could off to the side. Not realizing that there was a wooden fence there, she just walked right on, as the vampire turned to dust.</P>
<p>Thinking back again, when her father brought up religion, she froze. He thought that would immediately change her mind, and he started to smile. But she didn’t back down, she said she didn’t agree with him. That’s when he lost it.</P>
<p>Her father was dedicated to their religion. He spent many hours in the local synagogue, and believed staunchly in its teachings. He believed, well to him he knew, that Judaism was against homosexuality. However, she could have pointed out a few passages where it contradicted what he believed, but she was in enough trouble already.</P>
<p>While her father was trying to refrain from screaming, her mother had entered back into the argument. She told Willow that they knew what was best for her. She loved her parents very much, but over the last three years, she had learned a thing or two.</P>
<p>She remembered when she was five, and she thought she saw a monster under her bed. Her parents had rushed into her room, and assured her that monsters weren’t real, and nothing would hurt her. She knew the truth now.</P>
<P> Monsters were real, and they had hurt her. And it wasn’t her parents’ fault, but with monsters, and everything else, she learned to follow her instincts, to believe in herself to make the right decisions. She just wished her parents would believe in her.</P>
<P>Then, her father offered her an ultimatum. Stay away from Buffy Summers or leave the house. She and her mother stood there shocked for a minute. Willow couldn’t stay away from Buffy. It wouldn’t just end ‘them’, but it would end their friendship as well. She couldn’t and wouldn’t do that.</P>
<P>So, she went upstairs gathered some clothes, and her possessions, and then left the house. Her mother begged her to reconsider, and Willow simply told her, "I’m in love. You may not agree with it, but I do. You’ve told me to always follow my heart, and that’s what I’m doing. When you can accept that, well, you probably know where I’ll be."</P>
<P>Knocking on Buffy’s front door, she waited.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy opened the door, and looked her friend up and down. When she saw the duffel bag, she gasped.</P>
<P>"Oh no…" She said quietly.</P>
<P>She moved out of the way, and Willow walked in and shut the door. Dropping the bag to the ground, she fell to her knees, and started to sob.</P>
<P>"Oh Willow…come on, let’s get you to the couch." Wrapping her arm around Willow, she helped her up and over to the couch. Slowly, Willow stopped crying, and looked at Buffy.</P>
<P>"Can I stay here?"</P>
<P>"You know you can but…what happened?"</P>
<P>"I told them I was in love…they didn’t agree…told me to stay away from you, and I couldn’t lose your friendship Buffy. I could deal with losing ‘us’ but never my best friend. They gave me a choice…you or them…and…"</P>
<P>"You chose me?"</P>
<P>Willow nodded.</P>
<P>"You shouldn’t have done that."</P>
<P>"Why not?"</P>
<P>"I’m not worth it. I took you away from your family."</P>
<P>"First, you are worth it, and second, you didn’t take me away from anything. It was my choice. Okay?"</P>
<P>"Okay." Buffy said reluctantly. "I’m sure it’s only temporary, anyway."</P>
<P>"You think?"</P>
<P>"This is a big deal for them. You just need to give them time to realize the big mistake they made. You’re Willow. You’re the greatest person in world, and they may have lost sight of it, but it won’t last long. "</P>
<P>"Why?"</P>
<P>"Because you’re you."</P>
<P>Willow smiled weakly.</P>
<P>"Why’d your mom take it so easy?"</P>
<P>"Look at it this way. If you found out your daughter was fighting the forces of darkness every night, anything you found out afterwards, would be nothing compared to that. Not to mention a relief."</P>
<P>"Yeah, I guess it would be."</P>
<P>"Listen. Everything is going to be fine. You’ll see."</P>
<P>"Um…were you going to patrol?"</P>
<P>"Yeah."</P>
<P>"Can I come?"</P>
<P>"I don’t know if –"</P>
<P>"I need to not think about this right now. If I stay here, I will."</P>
<P>Buffy nodded, and they got up. She left her mom a note, and they left.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Willow was watching Buffy slay, but at the same time, she didn’t see a thing. She didn’t even register the vampire that turned to dust a mere foot away from her face. Buffy saw this, and knew Willow didn’t hear the vampire behind her.</P>
<P>Buffy pulled Willow out of the way, and staked it. Turning back to Willow, she spoke.</P>
<P>"Okay, you’re scaring me, Will."</P>
<P>At Buffy’s words, she seemed to snap back to reality.</P>
<P>"What? Oh. I’m fine." She smiled.</P>
<P>Buffy tried to hide her worry.</P>
<I><P>‘Okay. That was a fake smile. She never does that.’</P>
</I><P>They started to walk home.</P>
<I><P>‘This is bad, and I don’t know what to do.’</P>

</I><hr width=100>

<P>When they got in, Joyce was sitting in the living room.</P>
<P>"Hey you two."</P>
<P>"Hi mom."</P>
<P>"Hi Mrs. Summers."</P>
<P>"Oh, Willow, I cleared a space for you in Buffy’s closet. All your clothes are in there."</P>
<P>"Thanks. I’m gonna…" Willow said, pointing to the stairs.</P>
<P>"I’ll be up in a minute."</P>
<P>They watched her go, silent.</P>
<P>"I don’t know what to do, mom."</P>
<P>"I’m sure her parents just need time to adjust. Just be careful."</P>
<P>"Mom, I’m not gonna…"</P>
<P>"No, I mean she needs you. Comfort her, be careful with her."</P>
<P>"And if that doesn’t work?"</P>
<P>They were both silent.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Buffy climbed into her bed, where Willow was already asleep. She could practically feel the tension radiating off Willow’s body. Shifting closer, and wrapping her arms around her, Buffy felt her relax. Thinking Willow was going to be okay for the night, she drifted off to sleep.</P>
<P>Several hours later, she was awoken by the sound of gentle crying. They had shifted positions during the course of the night, because when Buffy opened her eyes, she was face to face with Willow. Wiping the tears off her face, Buffy sat up.</P>
<P>Willow laid her head down in Buffy’s lap, still crying softly. Stroking Willow’s hair, she spoke soothingly.</P>
<P>"It’ll be okay…" She repeated over and over.</P>
<P>Buffy didn’t know how long it took, but eventually Willow fell asleep, her head still in Buffy’s lap. Buffy stayed sitting all night, and tried to make sure she slept peacefully. And Willow did. </P>
