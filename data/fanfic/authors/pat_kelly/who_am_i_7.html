<!-- Who Am I? \ Forces - Pt.2 (Or - If You Don't Come In After Me, I Might...) -->

<p>"I'm being babysat now?" Riley asked Graham.</p>
<p>They were the only two people left in the
complex now. The rest of the members were either on assignment on just
going about their lives. Not Riley though. He had lost track of how long
he had been down there. Long enough, he figured, for it to be past nightfall.
That meant Buffy was either slaying, or knew he was contained and was trying
to figure out how to get him out. He hoped she wouldn't try anything, but
he knew she would.</p>
<p>He'd have to try and make things easier
for her then.</p>
<p>"It's the way it has to be. You know that
better than any of us."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but that was before I found out
we were all lied to."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"We were taken from other assignments to
this town, and told that it was because we were the best. We were going
to handle the problems the majority of the public would rather not know
about. Demons. No...they told us they were animals. Dangerous animals,
nothing more than that.</p>
<p>"But they are more than that. They're intelligent,
resourceful, capable of things that...I couldn't even imagine in a nightmare.
They've been around for a real long time, and most of them want nothing
more than to kill for fun. Or end the world. But we don't kill these threats.</p>
<p>"We cage them and experiment on them. To
learn. To create super soldiers. But the prototype must have gotten a few
wires crossed, because he's loose, indestructible, and kills anything and
everything. Instead of helping mankind to survive, we're helping to destroy
it. You don't see anything wrong in that?"</p>
<p>"Nice speech."</p>
<p>"Come on, Graham. We've all been played,
and I know you. I watched your back; I've saved your life. We're friends.
Forrest has always been a loose cannon. Always wanted the highest rank,
and given the opportunity, he would do anything to get it. And he has.
You're better than that. I know you are. You know this isn't right."</p>
<p>Graham's resolve was melting. "You just
want out."</p>
<p>"I don't think it's a secret that I don't
want to be in here, but believe what you want."</p>
<p>Graham stood there for another second,
and quietly walked away to think.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Faith bent over, and Spike was moving so
fast that he did the only thing he could think of. He tried to jump over
her. She straightened up, grabbed his leg as he was in midair, and tossed
him down. She kicked him in the stomach quickly, but he just as quickly
got to his feet.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, his hands were
on her shirt, and he threw her over his head. She was able to flip enough
so she landed upright. She had a small grin on her face as she turned around
to face him, proceeded to pull a stake out of her leather jacket, and then
they circled one another.</p>
<p>"You're a tricky one aren't you, pet?"</p>
<p>"And you're just as dumb as you look. I
thought that hair cut was bad before, but with the ridges, it looks wicked
gross."</p>
<p>He reached forward and grabbed her stake-free
arm. She used the butt of the stake to hit has face, and he let go when
it connected. She grabbed his wrist, twisted, and he had no choice but
to move behind her so she wouldn't tear his hand off.</p>
<p>"Oh please. You're a randy slut. You've
wanted to shag me as soon as you saw me."</p>
<p>"Don't flatter yourself. A girl has needs.
You were just a convenient toy at the time. There are other ways to get
off. Seeing you squirm did the job just fine."</p>
<p>He head-butted her, and she stumbled backward,
releasing his wrist. He took advantage of her temporarily stunned state,
and swept her legs, making her fall on her back. He stood over her.</p>
<p>"No, you didn't want me, did you? You want
the blonde bitch. You want to shag her, discard her, and add another name
to your list."</p>
<p>"Don't call her that!" She kicked her leg
up, connecting with his groin. He dropped to one knee, and she flipped
forward back to her feet, roundhouse kicked him in the side of the head,
and he fell on his side. "And I wouldn't do that to her. I won't."</p>
<p>"You're only fooling herself. What? You
think you love her? That's bloody rich. You have no idea what that is."</p>
<p>"And you do?"</p>
<p>"You. d be surprised."</p>
<p>She bent down over him. "I do love her.
And if it ever...it won't be screwing."</p>
<p>"How will you know the difference?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. Guess I'll have to wait
and see." She picked him up and thew him over the side of the docks. He
hung on by his hands, keeping himself from falling down into the water
below. "What's the matter, little rusty?" She stepped on his hand hard,
making him lose half of his grip.</p>
<p>"God...I hate slayers."</p>
<p>Faith was quiet then. After a few seconds,
he began to wonder what was going on. Then he felt a hand reach down, and
he had no other than to grab it. He was dragged up back onto the docks,
and stood up. Buffy was staring him in the face.</p>
<p>"How's the soldier?" He asked smugly.</p>
<p>"Dumb move." Buffy said.</p>
<p>She pushed him back hard into the warehouse
wall, and used her weight to keep him there. He was able to get his arm
up, and slug Buffy in the face. She was unfazed, and connected with his
face next. Faith pulled him back, and kneed him in the gut.</p>
<p>He looked at the two slayers, and they
stared at him. His chances weren't looking too good. He looked over the
edge of the docks. "What the hell." He dove off, and plunged into the water.</p>
<p>They both ran to look, but they couldn't
see him.</p>
<p>"Let's get him." Faith said.</p>
<p>"He's not worth the effort. Next time he's
dead, though."</p>
<p>"Why'd you -?"</p>
<p>"He pissed me off." She took a deep breath.
"And got Riley captured."</p>
<p>Faith went wide-eyed. "And you're just
gonna let him slide?"</p>
<p>"As long as he stays away from me. Got
bigger things to worry about, anyway. Listen, I...heard some of -"</p>
<p>"Forget it, B. Never happened." The brown
haired slayer began to walk away. She had expected Buffy's reaction. She
debated and debated with herself, but she knew Buffy wouldn't want her
around after what happened.</p>
<p>"Wait." Buffy said, and Faith stopped.</p>
<p>She still wasn't sure of her feelings exactly,
and things had gotten too complicated too fast for her to really figure
anything out. But, she did know that she didn't want Faith out of her life.
Not for a second.</p>
<p>"Yes it did. And I liked it. But I'm...
there's circumstances, and I'm not very focused right now. I do know that
I need you right now. Slaying, my life..."</p>
<p>"What did you say?" Faith asked, turning
around with a look of disbelief on her face.</p>
<p>"I need you. And I want us to be, to coin
your phrase, five by five. I really do want to talk about this, but "</p>
<p>"We have a jailbreak to plan. Let's get
it done." Faith said, smiling.</p>
<p>Buffy Summers just said she needed her,
and right now, that was good enough.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Later, at Giles' house, Willow, Giles,
Faith and Buffy were looking at blueprints and maps of the Initiative complex.
They were laid out on the coffee table.</p>
<p>"These were the only files Riley gave to
me." Giles said.</p>
<p>"Least we can figure out the best place
to go in." Faith said.</p>
<p>"It has the alarm triggers marked too."
Buffy said.</p>
<p>"And Tara and I could whip up a spell or
two." Willow said.</p>
<p>"This is all great, but how are we supposed
to take on a group of marines that have access to guns and other warped
Jetson-like weaponry?"</p>
<p>The door opened then, and Xander and Anya
walked in. The four people looked up, specifically at Xander, with small
smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>"What? What'd we miss?" He asked.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Graham lowered the field so he could bring
Riley in some food. Riley sat, holding his knees, up against the far corner.
For a moment, he thought Graham had come to let him out. No such luck.
The soldier simply sat the tray down on the floor, backed out of the cell,
and punched in numbers on the wall keypad to bring up the field again.</p>
<p>"First unit's due back in two hours." Graham
said, and then disappeared from Riley's sight.</p>
<p>He went over to the tray. It had a turkey
and cheese sandwich and a Coke on it. At least it wasn't bread and water.
When he went to pick up the sandwich, he moved the plate a little. He noticed
there was something underneath.</p>
<p>It was a Swiss Army Knife. That happened
to have a pretty sharp knife and a screwdriver.</p>
<p>He went over to the wall of the cell that
held the wiring for the keypad outside. His brain started to work as he
realized what Graham had given him. If he could cut away the padding and
reach the panel, he could shut off the electrical field by severing the
wires, and then hopefully get and reach Buffy before she came down there.</p>
<p>He had two hours, so he pulled the knife
out and began cutting away the thick padding, and got to work.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>They sent Xander off to the army base,
Tara had come over with a very old looking spell-book which she and Willow
were currently searching through, and Anya, finally having some time to
confront Faith, decided now was the time to make sure her territory had
been clearly marked. Territory, meaning Xander.</p>
<p>She walked over to where Faith and Buffy
were sorting through Giles' box of weaponry. Both slayers had a feeling
his collection would be a bit too dated to be effective against marines.
Before Anya could say anything, she saw Buffy pull out a couple bullet-
proof vests, and turn so she was looking in Giles' direction.</p>
<p>"Where'd you get these?" Buffy asked him.</p>
<p>"Ah..." Giles was slow to answer. "The
night your mother and -"</p>
<p>Buffy visibly shook, and held her hand
out. "Forget I asked."</p>
<p>Anya walked up to Faith. "You can't have
Xander."</p>
<p>"Got it. Does it count if -" Faith cut
herself off when she saw Buffy shaking her head quickly. Anya eyed the
dark-haired girl and eventually left them alone. "For someone who's getting
it regularly she sure is a tight ass. And I know the problem can't be satisfaction."</p>
<p>"Can we not go down that down that road?"
Buffy asked, a pleading edge to her voice.</p>
<p>"Yeah." She said softly.</p>
<p>Both of them were surprised how quickly
she agreed. But Faith's emotions were becoming clearer to her. It wasn't
just lust with Buffy. Xander was a fun relief, but not Buffy. It was more
than that with her. A lot more. She was sure of that now. She was still
a little scared of the whole 'love' thing, but she knew. Buffy knew how
she felt too, because she could see the shock on the older slayer's face.</p>
<p>"Faith..."</p>
<p>"So," Faith said grabbing a vest and getting
them out of the tense moment they were currently in, "if we don't get shot
in the face, these could be real useful."</p>
<p>"We won't be."</p>
<p>"If we pull this off, they'll be too busy
to shoot at you." Willow called in their direction.</p>
<p>They went over to see what the two witches
had in mind.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"You need help getting the vest on there,
Buff?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>He had come back with two M-16's, seven
clips, ten grenades, and a few flashbangs. It was getting harder and harder
to come up with excuses to take the weapons, and if he had taken anymore,
well...it wouldn't have been pretty. While he was teaching the two slayers
how to use the equipment, Willow and Tara were setting up for their spell.</p>
<p>"No." Buffy and Anya said at the same time.
The ex-demon stormed out of the house. "You're gonna go after her, right?"</p>
<p>He took a deep breath. "Guess I have to,
huh?"</p>
<p>"How come you sound upset over that? You're
gettin' boinked daily, aren't you?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>"You'd think that'd be enough, but boinking,
much to my surprise, isn't enough. I wish there was more to us than that,
but I don't think there is."</p>
<p>Faith was a little surprised. She thought
guys were only interested in getting some. That's where she got most of
her philosophies. The guys wanted quickies, so she learned to just get
quickies and go. It was easier for all involved. But now that she was starting
to change her thoughts on the matter, Xander's admission rocked her foundations
just a little more.</p>
<p>"Maybe you should tell her that." Buffy
said softly.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I...should..."</p>
<p>"Go. We've got it covered." Faith said.</p>
<p>Buffy smiled at Faith, thanking her for
encouraging him. As he walked out, she went over to Willow and Tara.</p>
<p>"Everything five by - I mean...set?"
Buffy said, stumbling over her words. She couldn't believe she said that.</p>
<p>"Mi lingo es su lingo, B." Faith said,
a smile in her voice, while she was trying to get a feel for the sight
on the M-16.</p>
<p>"Yeah, we're good." Willow assured her.</p>
<p>"It'll take us about forty five minutes
to get through it. It's a pretty heavy conjuring spell." Tara said.</p>
<p>"But you'll have control, right?" Buffy
asked.</p>
<p>"Hey, we're the two baddest Wiccans this
side of the Mouth. We can handle anything." Willow said, looking at Buffy.</p>
<p>Buffy's gaze shifted to Tara, who had the
biggest smile she had ever seen. As soon as Willow looked over, Tara looked
down at her lap. Buffy couldn't stand it. She looked at Tara and moved
her finger in a 'come here' motion.</p>
<p>Tara stood up nervously, and Buffy led
her back to where Faith was.</p>
<p>"You better say something to her soon,
or I will." Tara looked down again, and Buffy lifted her chin up. "Hey,
it's cool. I think it's great. Or it will be once you tell her."</p>
<p>"She's practically smitten with you, Tar'."
Faith added. "It usually makes me violently ill, but not in this case.
What the hell does smitten mean anyway?"</p>
<p>"You think?" Tara asked.</p>
<p>"We know." The slayers said.</p>
<p>"So do I." Tara said, a small grin on her
face as she looked at them knowingly. She went back over to Willow, leaving
them speechless.</p>
<p>"Feel like kicking some military ass?"
Buffy asked eventually. 'Riley, Riley, Riley...'</p>
<p>"Thought you'd never ask." 'Taken...don't deserve her...be happy with her friendship...'</p>
<p>As they walked out of the house, they heard
calls of good luck.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Riley was now at the point where one screw
up could ruin everything. Which wire to cut? Red, Blue, Yellow, or Green?
Circuitry wasn't his specialty. He had to pick the right one, though, or
else the alarm system would go off, and every marine would swarm the place
in minutes. And Graham was "ignoring" everything he was doing, so the other
marine wouldn't further implicate himself.</p>
<p>Red meant stop. So it had to be the red.
Or maybe the green. Cause that meant go out. That's where he wanted to
go, right?
 Out? Maybe it was..."Just do it." He
commanded himself.</p>
<p>He reached forward with the knife, and
cut the red wire...</p>
<p>And the alarm sounded.</p>
<p>"Which one was it?" Riley asked as Graham
came over.</p>
<p>"Red and blue. Sorry...sir."</p>
<p>Two wires? The only thing he could think
was of how unfair it was.</p>
<p>"It's all right soldier. You were just
doing your job."</p>
<p>All he could do now, was wait. It would
all be over soon</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>As soon as Buffy and Faith slid down the
cable in the elevator shaft, they heard the alarms sound. They had all
their gear either around their shoulders, or stuck in pouches on their
waists. Faith opened the hatch on the top of the elevator, and looked down
into its white-walled, somewhat claustrophobic space.</p>
<p>"You ready for this? Will and Tara should
be halfway through it by now." Buffy said.</p>
<p>"After you, girlfriend." Faith had this
confident, somewhat cocky look on her face that Buffy drew strength from.</p>
<p>Buffy's thoughts got strangely focused
right before she went into slaying mode. All those extra thoughts kind
of took a backseat, and she would just become an instinctive machine. Looking
at Faith now, actually seeing, without all those other distracting thoughts,
allowed her to finally see the truth.</p>
<p>She did love her. She had for a really
long time. It had started as soon as Faith come to town she realized. But
not at the time. Faith was unlike anyone she had ever met, and she was
drawn to it. The other slayer had kept her on her toes, connected with
her, excited her, in a way no one else had. Of the three people she had
opened her heart too, again discounting Parker and Scott, she was glad
she had. They were all special.</p>
<p>Angel had been a beautiful, passionate
experience, and even through all the pain she was glad she had gone through
it. Allowed to love him like she had. She didn't think any relationship
she had would ever be the same as that. But they were over now, and that
was for the best.</p>
<p>Riley was nice and stable, and she loved
him, and would get him safe, but even though he had been involved in an
underground organization that kinda fought demons, he was still...normal.
And that was great, it was a nice change from the cloud of darkness that
had surrounded her and Angel for longest time. But there were just things
he would never understand, things he had to know if they could hope of
surviving. Their relationship had started out based on untruths about who
they were, and that was never a good way to begin. They were too different.</p>
<p>Faith? She had lied, sure. So had Buffy.
But they weren't involved then. They had been cautious. It wasn't just
Faith who tested her limits; Buffy had been testing too. Now all that was
over, the walls were crumbling, and they knew each other. They were friends.
And she had wanted that for so long. Now she wanted to see what the next
level would bring, as apparently, did Faith.</p>
<p>If Buffy wanted to know something, no matter
what it was, Faith would tell her flat out. Nothing was toned down, and
she knew Faith just by looking into her eyes. Buffy was the same way. If
you looked hard enough, they were both open books. And Buffy wanted to
read.</p>
<p>She didn't know how far they would go,
what would happen...but she did know they both had a lot more in common
then one would think. Sure their childhood's had been pretty different,
but they both weren't perfect. Buffy knew that just one thing out of place,
and she could have had Faith's life; and Faith hers. They both were cautious
about whom they let in and shut out, and had a connection only they understood.</p>
<p>They made a pretty damn good team too.
Buffy had been searching too deeply for a reason she liked Faith's kiss.
A bond between them might have helped to reveal her feelings and brought
them closer, but she liked the kiss because she loved Faith. It was a simple
answer, however complicated. There were still doubts in her mind as to
what a "relationship" with Faith would be like. But she could see Faith's
eyes. They were scared too, but there was also love in them.</p>
<p>She realized that this dawning had come
at a really bad time, but she was glad it did. Because it would've unfair
to both Riley and Faith if she had tortured herself over it for months.
She would feel guilty with him, and awkward with her.</p>
<p>Angel had been detrimental to her too.
If she hadn't been so caught up in him last year, allowed herself to open
her eyes and realize the dead end they had been headed towards sooner,
she wouldn't have had to watch Faith or herself do those things to...but
the past was the past.</p>
<p>She felt good now, and would feel even
better once Riley was safe and this was over.</p>
<p>"B? You okay?"</p>
<p>"Huh? Oh. Yeah."</p>
<p>Buffy dropped down into the elevator, Faith
soon behind her.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Just as Riley had expected, every soldier
was standing in front of his cage within five minutes. Forrest approached
Graham, and asked him what had happened. Riley watched as Graham simply
said that he must have hidden the knife, and they just didn't pick it up
when they patted him down.</p>
<p>After Forrest was finished, he turned to
Riley looking angry and somewhat disappointed. Then he spoke into the to
the small intercom on the opposite wall.</p>
<p>"Gas. Cell Seven."</p>
<p>Inside the cell, the hidden vents on the
ceiling revealed themselves. The gas was tinted yellow, and Riley tried
to prepare himself by holding his shirt over his mouth, but he was just
delaying the inevitable. That's when they all heard the shots.</p>
<p>Before they could react, they were hit
by the disorienting and nauseating effect of a flash bang grenade. More
shots rang out, and the crackle of electrical sparks echoed off the walls.
Hacking and wheezing from the gas, Riley noticed that the electrical field
was down. He stumbled out, and was caught by two strong hands.</p>
<p>After a few more seconds, everything was
clear and silent once again. Most of the Initiative was trying to figure
out what the hell was going on, and then they saw. Supporting Riley a few
feet away was Buffy, M-16 being held in her free hand; and Faith holding
one as well. The marines quickly took their weapons into their hands.</p>
<p>"Gotta love a stand-off." Faith said, fire
in her eyes.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Back in Giles' house, Tara and Willow sat
in a circle on a cleared off spot on the floor, pink and blue powders surrounding
them. At the center, their hands met, and they chanted as a mist swirled
around them. They were both near physical exhaustion, their bodies shaking
lightly.</p>
<p>Giles watched with extreme fascination
as they said the final line of the spell.</p>
<p>"Let it be! Let him be the protector! Let
it be!"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"I love having the advantage even more."
Faith added.</p>
<p>The complex shook, and almost out of nothingness
appeared a hulking form. The creature was massive, his blue-pinkish skin
ripping with supernatural muscles. Near the bottom of his stomach, a small,
yellow crystal pulsated, clawed hands balled into fists, and horns protruded
from the side of his mouth.</p>
<p>First he looked back at Buffy and Faith,
and they pointed to the group of commandos in front of him. He nodded,
faced them, growled, then attacked. Faith joined him. Buffy helped Riley
back against a wall, and told him to stay put.</p>
<p>The men were getting thrown every which
way, their bullets having no effect on it. Faith turned her gun around,
hit Graham in the head with it, and tossed him in the cell. Buffy ran up
to Forrest who was trying to aim his gun at the conjured creature. She
got behind him, and put him in a chokehold.</p>
<p>"Call them off, we walk out."</p>
<p>"Not an option." Forrest said.</p>
<p>"Don't say I didn't warn you."</p>
<p>She let go and pushed him in front of her,
and then kicked him in the chest. He dropped to his hands and knees, and
his gun clattered to the floor. Buffy went to join Faith, who wasn't even
breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>"Ready to go?" Buffy asked while backhanding
someone to the ground.</p>
<p>Faith shook her head. "They'll just keep
coming. This is a war to them. Let's give 'em one."</p>
<p>"No guns unless absolutely necessary."</p>
<p>The two slayers fell in sync, and along
with the creature, continued to thoroughly beat anything that crossed their
path.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Riley, his eyes a tad blurry, watched the
fight from his semi-safe position. As his vision cleared, he found Buffy
in the crowd. Then he scanned the rest of the battle and saw Jackson aiming
his gun in Buffy's direction. He shouted to her, and she looked in his
direction, but by then the bullet was on its way, and she dropped to the
ground.</p>
<p>He scrambled to his feet, panic and anger
rushing through him, and noticed that Forrest was struggling to get up
and reach his gun that sat a few feet away. Their eyes met and they knew
what the other was thinking. They both got bursts of energy and lunged
for the weapon.</p>
<p>Both of their hands latched onto the barrel,
and they were struggling on the ground to get the upper hand. Riley used
all his strength and drove the gun forward making it hit Forrest's cheek
and cut it open. Forrest retaliated by bashing Riley's face with his elbow,
and Riley lost his grip.</p>
<p>He got to his feet, gun in hand. Riley
got up then too, and tried to kick out his ex-friend's legs. Forrest anticipated
this, and got close enough so Riley couldn't use his legs.</p>
<p>"I told you, Riley. Should have listened."</p>
<p>He pushed the gun barrel into Riley's chest,
driving him back, and shot him with extreme precision in the heart. Riley's
eyes went wide, he dropped to his knees, and then finally all the way to
the ground. He was gone, and his blood pooled underneath
 him.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>The bullet had simply lodged in Buffy's
vest, but it still took the wind out of her. She pushed herself onto all
fours after a few seconds. Faith was about to help her the rest of the
way when they both heard two shots. Buffy stood immediately.</p>
<p>One shot had come from a commando who hit
the yellow jewel on the creature's stomach. The creature slowly faded away.
The other shot was harder to place. Faith saw who had done it first.</p>
<p>"B! Over there!"</p>
<p>Buffy looked and saw Forrest, who appeared
to be looking down at something. She looked to where she had left Riley
then, and he wasn't there anymore. She fought her way over, Faith following.</p>
<p>'No. It's not what you think...it's
not...'</p>
<p>Then she saw his body, and went completely
numb. Faith wasn't though. She saw too, and quickly weighed her options.
Forrest was a threat to her, Buffy, and had just killed Riley. It wasn't
murder. It was war. So, she did what you're supposed to do in a war. Take
down the enemy. Guns were definitely necessary now. She raised her M-16,
and shot Forrest in the back. The man lurched forward, and fell.</p>
<p>Everyone stopped then. Buffy finally walked
forward, and crouched by Riley's body. Faith turned to the rest of the
team, and pulled a grenade off her waist.</p>
<p>"We could've just taken him and split.
But no. One last chance. How do you want this to end?" She held the grenade
out for them all to see.</p>
<p>They still had their guns aimed at her
when Graham emerged from the cell, holding his head in pain. He looked
around at what had happened. He was in command now.</p>
<p>"It's over. Back off." He told his men.
"Now."</p>
<p>They lowered their weapons. Faith looked
at Graham, and then tossed him the grenade. He caught it shakily.</p>
<p>"We're gone." She knelt down by Buffy and
shook her shoulder. "Come on, B. Gotta go." She said softly.</p>
<p>Buffy gave her a look that broke her heart.
