<!-- Who Am I? \ Changing Time (Or - Want, Take, Have) -->

<p>Spike stalked the campus grounds, trying
to fool himself into thinking he was still menacing. He was tired of everything.
Being beaten and hated by demons, some he could have easily ripped apart
if it wasn't for the chip, as well as taking beating from slayers with
short fuses. His reputation as an "evil bad ass" who killed two slayers
was no longer respected, and he decided it was time to do something about
that.</p>
<p>Not being able to kill allowed him some
freedom, however. Since he was no longer considered a threat, nobody paid
him much mind. That let him watch. Let him watch. Let him gather information
that could prove useful to him if he shared it with the right people. Might
get him back in the game. Why?</p>
<p>Because he planned to snitch. In exchange
for his un-neutering, of course. All he had to do was find one of the Initiative
guys. Plus, he would kill two birds with one stone. He would be able to
feed and taste human blood again, and would finally be able to strike back
at Buffy without laying a hand on her. But when he was "restored", he and
Faith were going to have a round or two.</p>
<p>He moved along the treeline now, and suddenly
felt like he was being followed. He turned his head to see, using his vampire
sight to scan the darkness, but saw nothing. When he turned back around,
a blaster was an inch away from his face.</p>
<p>"This was a bad idea."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"This was a bad idea." Faith said.</p>
<p>Across town, Buffy and Faith were approaching
her house, slowly making their way up the walk. It was the weekend, and
Tara, Willow and the two of them were going to have a girl's night. They
came straight from patrol, and Faith was just a little nervous.</p>
<p>"Why? Cause sleepovers aren't your thing?"
Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"Never had one before, but yeah. I'm more
a -"</p>
<p>"Dance club gyrator who likes to get all
the guys hot and horny. I know. And that is fun and certainly has its place."</p>
<p>Images of their dance at the Bronze last
year flashed through her mind. She had just let go, and it had been very
enjoyable.</p>
<p>"I'll admit that sleepovers might be considered
tame next to that, but they're nice too. Relaxing even. Besides it gets
you out of Giles' for awhile."</p>
<p>"Yeah, that chick of his just blew into
town, and it hasn't been quiet since."</p>
<p>"Bad images?"</p>
<p>"Nah. G was always kinda cute. The fact
that I'm not getting any 'oomph' is driving me nuts."</p>
<p>"Once again ignoring the Giles comment,
you and the grunting. You should see somebody about that."</p>
<p>"Didn't I just say that was the problem?"</p>
<p>"I guess…I meant…well, sorry I…can't help
there." Buffy stuttered.</p>
<p>'I'm sorry you can't either. What the hell?
Don't even go there.'</p>
<p>They made it to the porch, and Buffy reached
for the door handle. Their two Wiccan friends were already inside.</p>
<p>"Your mom."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"She doesn't want me in there. That's why
I don't…"</p>
<p>"It'll be okay. She knows you're coming,
and she's very forgiving, my mom is."</p>
<p>"She's letting me in just like that?"</p>
<p>"We might have…debated a little." Buffy
said slowly.</p>
<p>"Always going to bat for me, aren't you?"</p>
<p>Buffy smiled at her, and turned the knob.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Spike stood in the open ' briefing area'
of the underground complex, in the center of a circle of commandos who
had their weapons pointed at him. They were ready to fire at a moment's
notice. He was definitely beginning to think he made a big mistake.</p>
<p>The circle parted just enough for a man
to walk through.</p>
<p>"Hostile Seventeen." Forrest said.</p>
<p>"It's Spike, Soldier Boy."</p>
<p>"Shock it." One of the men stepped forward
and released an electrical charge from his weapon. Spike shook violently,
dropping to the ground. Forrest knelt down. "Animals don't have names.
Give me one reason why we shouldn't put you to sleep."</p>
<p>"Cause you're gonna wanna hear what I have
to say, mate."</p>
<p>"Put it in a cage."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"We're here!" Buffy called out. "Oh, there's
something I have to -"</p>
<p>Joyce walked into the foyer from the kitchen,
and Faith cast her eyes downward.</p>
<p>"It went okay?" Joyce asked.</p>
<p>"Only one baddie tonight." Buffy whispered
to Faith. "I promised her she could talk to you…um…alone."</p>
<p>Faith paled, and Buffy looked at her mother,
pleading with her eyes telling her mom to go easy on Faith. She went upstairs
slowly. Once her daughter was no longer in view, Joyce turned to Faith.</p>
<p>"Kitchen please."</p>
<p>"Uh, sure, Mrs. S."</p>
<p>Faith followed her into the kitchen, and
immediately hopped up and sat on the edge of the counter. Joyce's look
just as immediately told her to find somewhere else to sit. Faith removed
herself from the counter and spoke apologetically.</p>
<p>"Kind of a reflex. Sorry." She saw the
suitcases sitting by the back door. "Going somewhere?"</p>
<p>"Auction in Nevada to get some new pieces
for the Gallery. But I wanted to talk to you first."</p>
<p>Faith nervously slid her hands through
her hair. Just over a month ago she had held this woman hostage waiting
for Buffy to arrive. The woman had also called her psychotic. At the time,
and given the situation, she was right on the money. But how were they
supposed to do this? She had always liked Joyce. She was Faith's idea of
the perfect mom.</p>
<p>'Start by saying your sorry. You're pretty
used to saying it by now, aren't you?'</p>
<p>"Listen, I'm -" Faith started to say.</p>
<p>"Okay, I've thought about this for awhile.
And I've decided that if Buffy has forgiven you, then you must be -"</p>
<p>"Sane again?"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't have put it exactly like that."</p>
<p>"It's okay. I'm happier now. You were right."</p>
<p>"Mother's intuition. I can't not forgive
someone who makes an effort to turn her life around. Especially someone
who helps my daughter."</p>
<p>"It's my job."</p>
<p>"I don't just mean the slaying." Faith
showed her puzzlement clearly. "You don't know that she spent hours every
day by your bed in the summer, do you?"</p>
<p>"She did?"</p>
<p>"The last thing she wanted was you to be
in the hospital. She used to tell me how she thought it was her fault.
That if she'd reached you sooner you wouldn't have left. If she had been
more of a friend. She kept going to see you hoping you'd wake up.</p>
<p>"She thought since you both healed fast,
you'd bounce back quickly. Every time, it was always the same, and she
came home torturing herself."</p>
<p>"I knew she felt bad…"</p>
<p>"Well, I was surprised she talked to me
about it. She said Xander and Willow wouldn't understand. I didn't really
understand. All I knew was that she was hurting. The summer ended, and
you were still there. She gave the hospital our number and Mr. Giles'.
She called every night until you woke up a couple weeks ago."</p>
<p>"Wow." Faith said quietly.</p>
<p>"I like you, Faith, and so does my daughter.
So I'll only say this once. Don't ever hurt her again."</p>
<p>The tone in Joyce's voice made Faith forget
her enhanced strength entirely. She really didn't want to have to face,
or imagine, the possible
 consequences.</p>
<p>"Never. I swear."</p>
<p>Joyce smiled. "Good." She went to the door,
and began picking up the suitcases. "Then you…have fun, and…try not to
drink too much."</p>
<p>"Drink?"</p>
<p>"I've got a daughter in college, I have
alcohol in the house, and people are spending the night. I'm not that naive.
But as long as there's no evidence when I get back, I can remain in denial."</p>
<p>"You're pretty cool, you know that?"</p>
<p>Joyce opened the door. "Please. That's
a mother's worst nightmare."</p>
<p>Faith chuckled. "Later, Mrs. S."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Spike pulled himself up off the floor of
the cell, trying to get his bearings. When he realized where he was, he
cursed. He had already been locked away in the white, white, and more white,
walled cell. It was worse the second time. He saw Forrest staring in at
him from the other side of electric field keeping him from escaping.</p>
<p>"Organizational problems?" Spike asked.
"I heard things have been going downhill here lately."</p>
<p>"Is that right?" Forrest said.</p>
<p>"And since I got nothing to lose, and you've
got everything to lose, you're gonna listen to what I have to say, caged
or not."</p>
<p>"Then start."</p>
<p>"Slayer's been mucking up the works, right?
Your leader is dead, your new leader is whipped beyond belief…but you can't
do jack."</p>
<p>Forrest knew the vampire was right. The
Initiative wasn't running very smoothly anymore, Riley, the next in the
chain of command was never here, and when he was it was for very brief
periods of time, and Buffy. He wanted her out of everything. When she arrived,
that's when everything started to fall apart.</p>
<p>"What have you got?" Forrest asked, walking
up close to the cage.</p>
<p>"You're military. You got rules. Well I
can show you proof that your new commander is playing both sides trying
to close up this place. Then you take action."</p>
<p>"The catch?"</p>
<p>"I show you, you take this chip outta my
head, and I take care of your slayer problem. What you do with 'Mr. Iowa'
is your call. Do we have a deal?"</p>
<p>Forrest locked eyes with Spike. He had
so much hatred for this hostile. If he set him free, he could terrorize
innocent people. But if he was right, the Initiative could be put on track
again, and Riley and Buffy would be dealt with. He punched some numbers
into the keypad, and the field shut off.</p>
<p>"Let's go. I want this proof in my hands
before you get anything."</p>
<p>"Take it easy, Blade Jr. You'll get your
proof. Riley's a big deal around here, so when you see it…"</p>
<p>"I do what needs to be done."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>The four girls were in the living room
watching the single television in the house. Faith and Buffy were lounging
on the sofa, and Willow and Tara were lying on the floor. Boredom had officially
set in an hour before. They were watching a re-run of South Park.</p>
<p>"You'd think with my time off they'd get
their asses in gear and make new eps." Faith said.</p>
<p>"The animation isn't even that complicated."
Buffy agreed. "Who wants popcorn?"</p>
<p>Three hands raised. Faith picked up the
remote and started going through channels as Buffy got up to go to the
kitchen. She stared down at the redhead and the blonde witch. Tara was
looking at Willow, with the 'I love you and can't stand it' look.</p>
<p>Then it hit Faith. Willow didn't know.
She had just assumed, but Willow didn't really know. It wasn't like she
was going to play matchmaker; she just found it amusing. She needed to
be sure of something before she would even consider getting involved in
Willow's life anyway.</p>
<p>"Hey, Willow?"</p>
<p>Willow turned her head. "Yeah?"</p>
<p>"We're five by five, right?"</p>
<p>"We are." She smiled in reassurance.</p>
<p>"Okay that's it." Tara said standing. "I
need to find out what that means or I'll go crazy."</p>
<p>Willow stood up too. "We could look it
up on the net. Buffy's mom has a laptop somewhere."</p>
<p>Buffy walked in then, carrying a bowl of
popcorn. "Feel free. It's gathering dust in her closet."</p>
<p>"Um…I've never really…used computers…that
much." Tara said slowly.</p>
<p>Willow gaped, and the slayers' held their
breaths. Buffy carefully put the bowl down, and made her way over to Willow.
Just in case of fainting. Willow's lips were moving, but no sound was coming
out.</p>
<p>"I think you broke her." Faith said.</p>
<p>Before Tara could respond, her hand was
being grabbed, and Willow practically ran up the steps with her in tow.
About ten minutes later they heard Willow's voice again, and the loud modem
noises one would expect when connecting.</p>
<p>"We lost 'em forever." Buffy said, coming
to sit on the couch.</p>
<p>"Then it's a good thing I didn't mention
my lack of computer skills." Faith said.</p>
<p>"Probably." Buffy laughed. "So what do
you want to do?"</p>
<p>Faith jumped off the couch then, and headed
for the kitchen. "Make drinks."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"As in alcohol?" Buffy asked, following
her into the kitchen.</p>
<p>"No, as in Shirley Temples." Faith said
sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Beer and I really don't mix."</p>
<p>Faith was searching through the cabinets.
"Who said anything about beer? There's a time and a place for it, yeah.
Usually parties. I was thinking daiquiris."</p>
<p>"Daiquiris? Isn't that a little tame for
you?"</p>
<p>"Normally, but I promised your mom there
would be no evidence, and for me to stick to it, gotta go 'buzz only' tonight.
She's gotta have -"</p>
<p>"Whoa. Whoa. Hold it. You told my mom we
were going to drink?"</p>
<p>"No. She expects us to. And I don't want
to disappoint her. Now are you gonna help me or not?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. What are you looking for?"</p>
<p>"Rum and strawberries."</p>
<p>Buffy went over to the fridge, and pulled
out a bag of strawberries. She set them on the counter. In the cabinet
below the sink, were bottles of rum and other assorted alcoholic beverages.
She got out a bottle, and set that out on the counter as well.</p>
<p>"Now what?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Spike kicked in Buffy and Willow's dorm
room door, and walked in. Forrest followed from behind.</p>
<p>"So where is it?" He asked Spike.</p>
<p>"Here. Been watching them. He gives her
files, and then she takes them back here. She didn't want to risk that
ex-librarian's life by leaving them with him. Thoughtful girl, isn't she?"</p>
<p>Spike checked under the beds.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>The bureau.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>By Willow's computer.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>That's when he opened the closet. First
he only saw clothes, and then he looked up at the ceiling. There was a
good-sized vent there. He pushed on it, and it moved. He slid the covering
off, and stuck his hand into the vent. He felt something.</p>
<p>"Clever, Slayer, but not clever enough."</p>
<p>Coming out of the closet a few seconds
later, he held a slightly bent folder in his hands that had the word classified
on it printed in big red letters. He handed it to Forrest, who looked through
it.</p>
<p>"This is a member list and history going
all the way -"</p>
<p>"Great. I fulfilled my end, give me what
I want."</p>
<p>Forrest stared at him, closed the folder,
and grabbed his walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>"Deactivate HST Seventeen's implant. Now."</p>
<p>Before Spike knew what was happening, he
was having some kind of a seizure,
and had collapsed to the ground, unconscious.
Forrest left the room, shutting the door behind him.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Later, Faith and Buffy were quite buzzed,
but still coherent, sipping from their second daiquiris of the night. They
had offered drinks to the girls upstairs, but they hadn't received any
answer. Faith whispered to Buffy on the sofa.</p>
<p>"They're...you know…"</p>
<p>Buffy went wide-eyed, and then slapped
Faith's arm. "They are not!"</p>
<p>"I'm wicked serious. They do, but Willow
doesn't know. Don't tell me you haven't noticed."</p>
<p>"I guess…I…"</p>
<p>"Does that wig you out?"</p>
<p>"Hey if she wants to be gay, who am I to
get all freaked out? We've been through too much for me to care about something
like that. What kind of friend would be if I didn't stand behind her?"</p>
<p>"Good for you."</p>
<p>"Plus, if Tara makes her happy, I'm all
for it. Especially cause of Oz."</p>
<p>"Yeah, what happened there? He knock claws
with a she-wolf or something?" Buffy simply stared. "He did? And here I
always thought he was a stand up guy. Guess they'll always stay an impossible
dream."</p>
<p>"You said it."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? You got Beefstick."</p>
<p>"Hey!" Buffy waggled her finger. "His name
is Riley. And he's still got this blockage about not being equal to me.
Macho and identity issues. It's a lot of work."</p>
<p>"You don't love him?"</p>
<p>"I…yeah, I do. But he's got…well, let's
look at my men history. Angel nearly drained me of all my blood and then
skipped town."</p>
<p>"You let him bite you?"</p>
<p>"Saved his life. Then he leaves. Then he
comes back to," Buffy made quote marks with her fingers, "rescue me, doesn't
say a word and leaves again."</p>
<p>"Can I call him an asshole?"</p>
<p>"I'll join you."</p>
<p>"Asshole." They both said at the same time.</p>
<p>"Scott dumped me cause I wasn't stable
enough. But you took care of him for me." Buffy grinned.</p>
<p>"Which was major fun."</p>
<p>"Then I got used by Parker…he pulled a
number on me."</p>
<p>Faith's eyes suddenly got serious. "The
guy used you?"</p>
<p>"I got over it. Was kind of going through
a self-image problem for awhile, but I moved on to Riley."</p>
<p>"Nobody should ever, ever, use you, Buffy.
You're too…" Faith trailed off, still sober enough to know not to finish.</p>
<p>"Hey you said my name! Yay!"</p>
<p>Faith smiled again. "That 'uffy' part always
trips me up."</p>
<p>"I like 'B'. I always know who's talking
to me. I'd never let anyone else call me that."</p>
<p>They stared at each other in silence. They
couldn't turn away. Both girls knew this conversation, this whatever, had
to stop. They weren't thinking straight, and there could and would be complications.
Of that they were sure. Buffy decided that now was the time to stop drinking,
and get up. Possibly get a shower to clear her head. A cold shower.</p>
<p>She rose off the couch, and was about to
say something when Faith pulled her back down, and kissed her. Hard. And
Buffy responded, despite her better judgement. She didn't know what was
happening.</p>
<p>Well she knew what was happening. Her tongue
was dueling with Faith's. Her hands running through Faith's hair.</p>
<p>But she didn't understand why. Actually
she did. Because she wanted to. But she really didn't know why she wanted
to. Well, because it felt good. So she kept doing it.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"You think they're okay?" Tara asked Willow
upstairs.</p>
<p>"I'm sure. What could possibly happen?"</p>
<p>Tara didn't know how much longer she could
go without telling Willow her feelings. She was afraid, but she had never
felt this way about anybody before. Not like this.</p>
<p>"Probably nothing." Tara sighed, seeing
that Willow didn't catch her double meaning. "So what's URL mean?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Back in the Initiative, Forrest was speaking
to a group of his fellow marines and soldiers.</p>
<p>"We have a situation. It involves Agent
Finn, and it'll have to be addressed as soon as possible."</p>
