<!-- Who Am I? \ Pain Of The Past (Or - All Men Are Beasts) -->

<p>Faith stood in the middle of the park.
It was bright, sunny, and peaceful. She saw Xander, Willow and Giles sitting
over at a picnic table. They were calling her over, and she saw Buffy come
up to her. The blonde reached for her hand.</p>
<p>"Come on, we have plenty of food. Don't
tell me you're not hungry."</p>
<p>"I'm coming. Just thinking."</p>
<p>"About?"</p>
<p>"How long this'll last."</p>
<p>"We'll make it last. I've got your back."
Buffy started to look around. Something wasn't right. Faith felt it too.
"Hurry."</p>
<p>The sky changed. Over by the gang, the
sun shined brightly. Past where they stood, the sky had darkened. They
were in the middle. The two slayers tried to go back to their friends,
but they couldn't move. Out of the darkness, a figure emerged.</p>
<p>"Faith, I told you never to leave me. Now
look what you've gone and done. You have to do the right thing, my dear.
I can't wait forever." The Mayor said.</p>
<p>"I am doing the right thing."</p>
<p>"I was hoping you wouldn't say that." Buffy
had had enough. She rushed over to the dark side of the park, ready to
attack him.</p>
<p>"Buffy, no!"</p>
<p>The Mayor changed forms. A large snake
was in his place. Also out of the darkness, came Spike, who held Buffy
still for the hungry beast. Faith ran to try and save her, but as soon
as she got close enough, Spike released Buffy, and threw her back into
the light.</p>
<p>Buffy screamed to her. "Faith! Get out!"
She couldn't help her now.</p>
<p>Faith struggled, as the Mayor-Snake dipped
down, his jaws opened wide.</p>
<p>"You belong here, Faith. Stay with us."</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"NO!"</p>
<p>Two slayers screamed simultaneously, though
both at different places. At Giles' house, Faith's scream awoke Giles,
who was very startled. In the dorm, it awoke Willow, who was instantly
at her friend's side.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"You're sure you're all right?" Giles asked
Faith some fifteen minutes later.</p>
<p>She sat at the table, picking at a scone.
"Just a dream. Nothing."</p>
<p>"Possibly, but in my experience, a slayer's
dreams are more often than not, prophetic."</p>
<p>"Nah, I think it's more my own personal
demons."</p>
<p>"You say that so casually." He came from
the kitchen carrying a kettle. "Tea?"</p>
<p>"It's a gift. I'll pass."</p>
<p>"I'm here to listen if you should ever
need it."</p>
<p>"And major appreciation for that." Faith
got up, and walked over to the stereo. "Mind?"</p>
<p>"Nothing too mind numbing?"</p>
<p>"Reforming Slayer's honor."</p>
<p>She turned on the power, and a song was
just beginning. She waited to see what it was.</p>
<p>(When you look into a mirror
 Do you like what's looking at you
 Now that you've seen your true reflections
 What on earth are you gonna do)</p>
<p>(Find some inspiration
 It's down deep inside of you
 Amend your situation
 Your whole life is ahead of you
 Your whole life is ahead of you)</p>
<p>(Remember the time you hung out with the
boys now
 Remember the things you used to say
 I thought by now you'd be the president
 But after all that was yesterday)</p>
<p>(You've had time to go out in the world
now
 But you chose to run away
 People ask you what your doin' now
 You don't even know what to say)</p>
<p>(You think life is like a movie
 Where it all works out in the end
 I think life is like a dessert
 Where does it go where does it begin)</p>
<p>(When you look into a mirror
 Do you like what's looking at you
 Now that you've seen your true reflections
 What on earth are you gonna do)</p>
<p>(Find some inspiration
 It's down deep inside of you)</p>
<p>She just stood still after it was over.
How come everything just seemed to connect sometimes? The dream…and now
this. Did she like what she saw? She had the inspiration, but was her reflection
changing? Was she changing? Running her hands through her hair, she closed
her eyes, then turned off the stereo, and faced Giles.</p>
<p>"Too early for music, don'tcha think?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>The college gym had become the slayers'
training spot. They were able to schedule to have an hour a day, so no
one would interrupt them. Well, everyone except the gang, and its new member,
who were just observing and speaking amongst themselves. Tara, Willow,
and Xander.</p>
<p>Buffy and Faith were sparring with staffs.
Their bows clashed.</p>
<p>"Where's the Bo', B?" Faith asked her.</p>
<p>"You really have to learn my whole name,
cause that just sounded really funny." She brought the staff to a vertical
position, and Faith matched it. "Actually, if you make the vamps fall over
cause they're laughing hysterically, that could be a bonus."</p>
<p>"So are you gonna answer my question sometime
in the next millennium or what?"</p>
<p>"He's -" Faith tried to sweep her legs,
but Buffy jumped up, missing it. "Teaching."</p>
<p>Faith stopped abruptly, and Buffy was able
to knock the staff out of her hands.</p>
<p>"A teacher?"</p>
<p>"He was my old Psych professor's TA. He
has to take over until they get a replacement."</p>
<p>"How'd she bite it?"</p>
<p>"She's Adam's Dr. Frankenstein."</p>
<p>"Damn. Harsh. Wait, is that the name of
the monster or the guy?"</p>
<p>"I…don't know. Anyway, that's what you
get for messing with the dark, I guess."</p>
<p>They both thought it was a good idea to
stop. They both knew they had shared the dream, though they didn't say
much about it. Now wasn't the time anyway, because they were both still
a little freaked by it.</p>
<p>"It's the name of the guy who made him,"
Xander said, "and is the sweatfest
 over?"</p>
<p>"'Fraid so, Xand."</p>
<p>"There you are!" Anya said loudly, entering
the gym.</p>
<p>"Just in time too." Faith smirked.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>It was the nightly patrol. This time they
were patrolling campus, thinking that's where Adam would stick close to.
This time, Willow and Tara were with them, walking a few feet behind. Xander
was with Anya, apparently "making up for lost time", and they didn't want
to go there. Not even Faith.</p>
<p>"You really wanna be out here?" Willow
asked Tara.</p>
<p>"You talk about it all the time. If this
is something you do, I wanna see...you know, be with you." Tara realized
how that last part sounded. "Be with you when you do this." She looked
away, trying not to hyperventilate.</p>
<p>Willow smiled. "I like that you want to,
really, but it's dangerous."</p>
<p>"It's not that safe for you either, is
it?"</p>
<p>"Well…yeah. But Buffy watches out for me.
That and I use my resolve face till she caves."</p>
<p>"I heard that." Buffy called back.</p>
<p>"And now I have someone to watch over.
I don't wanna see you hurt." Willow whispered, grabbing Tara's hand. "We'll
be careful, and I won't let you be."</p>
<p>"I know. I trust you."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Faith looked back at the two girls. "There's
not many people who can border 'cutesy' and the 'get a room' phase as well
as they can. Not that I'd know much about how relationship phases work,
but - "</p>
<p>Buffy had been lost in thought, absentmindedly
twirling a stake. "Hmmm? What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"You mean you don't…? Nothing."</p>
<p>"Oh. So…the dream."</p>
<p>"Definitely a bitch."</p>
<p>"It had an unpleasant quality to it, yeah.
Do you think that's what we're both scared of?"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"You know. Me not being able to save you
from something and you not…being able to save yourself? I mean, I don't
think it was prophecy-related. Because of what happened with Spike he's
been on our minds, and…"</p>
<p>"Dream psychology and slaying really don't
mix, B." Buffy looked down at the ground. Faith cursed under her breath.
"Hey, you know I'm not exactly the 'lay on a couch, poor out my feelings'
type of girl." 'Or am I and I just don't know it?'</p>
<p>"Yeah. But I had the dream too, and I just
thought that we could try and figure it out. Leaving things unsettled isn't
my style."</p>
<p>"I…when we're done…" Faith trailed off,
her eyes widening. "You can tell me why you totally played down this thing."</p>
<p>"What thing…damn."</p>
<p>They stared at Adam, and he stared right
back.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy risked a glance back at them, and
Faith's look was a little more forceful.</p>
<p>"What's that?" Tara asked, pointing up
ahead.</p>
<p>"Something we run away from." Willow said.</p>
<p>"But -"</p>
<p>"This is also what I do. I go get help."</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"Giles, or Xander, or Riley…just come on."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"I wore him out. I think it was the tying
to the bedpost." Anya said.</p>
<p>She and Xander had come to Giles house.
She was currently explaining to Giles the details of their latest "go in
the hay". Xander was sitting on the steps, his head in his hands. Giles
wasn't fairing much better.</p>
<p>"Why do you insist on always coming here
directly after…God, I can't say it." Giles said.</p>
<p>"You mean after the orgasms?"</p>
<p>Giles rubbed his eyes. "Forget it. Please."</p>
<p>"Well I have to tell somebody. The whole
point of making somebody have good orgasms is to make others jealous."</p>
<p>"Jealous? I'm rather revolted actually.
Most humans do not go into detail about their sexual exploits. Normally,
they light a cigarette and keep things to themselves."</p>
<p>"Where's the fun in that? And cigarettes
aren't good for health."</p>
<p>"And you're not good for mine." Giles muttered.
He looked over at Xander, trying to understand why the boy was just satisfied…he
stopped that train of thought immediately.</p>
<p>"I don't think he wants us here. We should
leave."</p>
<p>Xander jumped up off the steps. "Oh thank
God."</p>
<p>Just then, the front door opened, and Tara
and Willow came bursting in. They were both out of breath.</p>
<p>"Good…you're here…" Willow panted.</p>
<p>"Willow, what is it?"</p>
<p>"Buffy…Faith…went…Riley's…not there…campus…bad…Adam…"</p>
<p>"Buffy and Faith are on campus and they're
in trouble. Adam's there." Tara cleared up.</p>
<p>Willow nodded quickly. Xander ran to the
chest of weapons, and pulled out the blaster.</p>
<p>"Stay here." Giles told the three girls.</p>
<p>"We can do a protection spell." Tara offered.</p>
<p>"Anything that might help is a good idea."</p>
<p>Anya went up to Xander and kissed him quickly,
and then he and Giles were out the door.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy and Faith circled Adam cautiously.
He had not made a move, but was merely watching them. Studying them. Normally
Faith would rush in and attack, but most bad guys weren't as calm as he
seemed to be. She couldn't predict what he was going to do, and her Slayer
"sixth sense" was telling her to be cautious. Buffy was glad Faith was
following it for once.</p>
<p>"So, Adam, where's your flunkies?" Buffy
asked.</p>
<p>"Flunkies?" He appeared to think a second.
"Ah. The vampires. I have no desire to waste a resource. You would easily
end their existence, would you not?"</p>
<p>"Yep. Can see you're still big on the learning
and science experiments."</p>
<p>He appeared to think once more. "Yes. Buffy
Anne Summers. You possess strength that others of your species do not.
Enemy of vampires. A Slayer. An intriguing being."</p>
<p>"That's me. Have you met Faith? We're in
the same business."</p>
<p>"Whoever did the rush job on you has to
go back to the drawing board." Faith said.</p>
<p>"A sarcastic remark meant to increase anger.
I am unaffected."</p>
<p>"But I try so hard."</p>
<p>"I was informed of your presence. My learning
process is nearly complete. But I must know something. A question plagues
me."</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>"Faith Adams. Eighteen human years. Conceived
in Boston by Jack and Christine." Faith paled, and Buffy just held her
breath.</p>
<p>"Father arrested for spousal abuse the
following year and convicted in conjunction with possession of narcotics.</p>
<p>"At age five police were called to your
residence for a domestic disturbance. You were found in the corner, shattered
alcoholic containers surrounding you, facial lacerations and cigarette
burns on your forearm.</p>
<p>"Taken to a hospital, several hours later,
doctors were shocked to learn that all your wounds had healed. Mother agreed
to attend meetings and seek counseling in order to retain custody.</p>
<p>"A year later your father was released
on probation and forced to go to a drug treatment center. He returned home
and proceeded to strangle your mother terminating her life. Police arrived
just before your father did the same to you."</p>
<p>Faith was shaking, and couldn't move. Buffy
knew she had to make some kind of move. This was too much.</p>
<p>"You were placed in an orphanage. Caretakers
noted that you were frightened, sometimes hostile. At the age of fourteen
you had tried to run away several times, succeeding temporarily, for months
at a time. Authorities often found you in bars or street corners, offering
yourself.</p>
<p>"They repeatedly returned you, despite
your attempts to stay away. They did not recommend you for a foster home,
or adoption. Psychologists recorded deep emotional scarring, and they couldn't
stop you from trying to take your own life.</p>
<p>"At fifteen, despite objections, a woman
chose to adopt you, and strangely, there is no more record of your existence
after that point."</p>
<p>"That woman was my watcher, you bastard."
Faith said.</p>
<p>"Bastard? Hmm…fatherless son. That's an
appropriate description."</p>
<p>Buffy was a few feet behind him.</p>
<p>"What's your question?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>"I know all about you, yet I can't understand
the reason you continue to live. Is it not rather pointless?" Faith was
clenching her fists. "My question upsets you? Interesting."</p>
<p>Buffy ran, and jumped on his back, grabbing
around his neck area. Faith's attention had been focused on Adam, so she
had not seen where Buffy went. Adam flung her off, and she hit a tree.</p>
<p>"Buffy! No!"</p>
<p>Faith charged him and he grabbed her easily
by the neck.</p>
<p>"Faith! Get -" Buffy yelled, and tried
to run to help, but something pulled her back.</p>
<p>"Your life has been full of negative emotion.
Humans, I've learned, struggle with such feelings. Losses, grief, pain.
The right thing to do would be to end it. Would you like me to?"</p>
<p>Faith struggled, her legs kicking wildly.
"I'm doing the right thing. I don't need the easy way out."</p>
<p>"What do you need?" Adam squeezed harder.
"Air? Friendship? Lov -"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Adam was cut off, as he felt an electrical
blast hit him from behind. He dropped Faith, who was gasping for air. Seemingly
out of nowhere, a team of commandos in full gear came out of the shadows,
and surrounded him. Buffy ran in, and pulled Faith out quickly.</p>
<p>All the men aimed at him, firing, but except
for being mildly jolted, he continued to walk. As he reached a man standing
in his way, he released a skewer from his arm, which went directly through
the man's heart.</p>
<p>"Fall back!" One of them yelled.</p>
<p>They broke out of their containment formation,
and Adam continued to walk.</p>
<p>"I can learn no more here." He said.</p>
<p>One of the men waved his hand, and four
commandos disappeared, silently following Adam. Three others picked up
their dead friend, and vanished into the darkness as well. All except one,
who rushed over to Buffy and Faith. He took off his facemask.</p>
<p>It was Riley, and as soon as Faith saw
that it was him, she bounced up and grabbed him by the shirt.</p>
<p>"How. Did. He. Know." She said, stated
each word slowly, and angrily.</p>
<p>"Professor Walsh must have downloaded files
into his brain."</p>
<p>"But you didn't know about slayers until
me." Buffy said.</p>
<p>"No, we didn't. The Initiative has files
on anyone who's ever been in Sunnydale. No matter who it is. It's policy
handed down by the higher ups."</p>
<p>Faith let go of his uniform, but still
glared at him.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you tell us?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"I wasn't sure if...not until I saw."</p>
<p>"Like hell." Faith said.</p>
<p>"How'd you know he was here?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"I was down there searching through the
computers when Graham spotted him walking on campus. Since I was there,
and I'm commanding officer, I led the team. I'm just glad we were in time."</p>
<p>"Good thing you were." Faith turned and
walked away somewhat. "Later, okay?"</p>
<p>Riley nodded, and walked off. Neither he
nor the two slayers saw the person watching off to the side. Buffy went
over to Faith, and they both knew the dream discussion wasn't necessary
anymore.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Faith couldn't hide her past anymore, either.
She wanted to remain stone-faced, and tough, but as soon as she caught
Buffy's eyes and comfort they were offering, telling her it was okay, she
dropped to her knees, her entire body shaking with sobs.</p>
<p>Buffy wrapped her arms around her friend,
her partner.</p>
<p>"Look at me. I'm…"</p>
<p>"A survivor."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah? And what do I have to show for
it?"</p>
<p>"A friend."</p>
<p>"Who pities me."</p>
<p>"Who respects you, and wants your friendship
too."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Cause, well…you're wicked cool girlfriend."
Faith choked on her own laughter, and Buffy tried to glare, but couldn't
pull it off. "And it looks like some of our other friends are calling us
over."</p>
<p>Faith looked up and saw Giles and Xander
standing a couple yards away. She got up, shook off her tears, and with
Buffy's arm around her shoulders, they went to meet them.</p>
