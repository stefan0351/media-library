<!-- My Time in Sunnydale \ Part 2 -->

<p>The next day, I woke to Giles offering me scones, which I tried as politely as possible to
decline. I had to crash on the couch, and as I stretched, it was then that I realized I
was starting to develop an odor.  I needed a shower, but I had no change of clothes. Once
that became an issue, they would suggest that we go to my "uncle's" house to get clothes.
That would be bad. So I immediately told Giles that when I found my "uncle" dead, the
place had been ransacked and robbed.</p>

<p>That led to a suggestion from Giles. One I had not anticipated. Spare clothes from Xander.
It would be no problem, Giles said, and went to call him. I had a couple problems with
this. First was size. Xander was taller than I was. I was as tall as Buffy, and she just
barely reached his shoulders. Second, was dread at Xander's wardrobe. I remembered very
clearly what Riley had to wear, and I feared I was in for the same fashion nightmare.</p>

<p>Ignoring the headache I had just developed, Willow and Buffy then entered the house. No
Tara though. Poor girl. She could probably sense Buffy's jealousy and decided to stay
away. I wouldn't have minded talking to her, because there were things I wanted to ask.
They sat on either side of me, Willow her usual cheery self, and Buffy once again seeming
worried about something. Why couldn't she be happy for more than two minutes?</p>

<p>It was then that I saw that Willow had carried in a box of donuts with her. Yes, it was
official. I loved this hacker. She must have seen the euphoric expression on my face at
the sight of the donuts, because she figured it all out.</p>

<p>"The scones?" I nodded. Not another word was said on the subject.</p>

<p>We dug into the bakery marvels, and Buffy downed all the jellies in less than five
minutes. She hadn't said a word to either of us since she had arrived. I had to ask Willow
what was up. Giles finally got off the phone, and Buffy moved to intercept him.</p>

<p>"We've gotta talk." She said to him, and they had another 'private' meeting in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>I looked at them, and they were engrossed. Willow looked around conspiratorially, and
leaned in close to me. She sniffed me first, scrunching her nose.</p>

<p>"Soap is a wonderful invention. Don't you remember the 'Rubbery Ducky' song?" As quickly
as she said that, she was back on topic, not even giving me a chance to respond. "She got
a call from Angel."</p>

<p>Uh oh. That could mean so many different things. "And that is?" I hated having to play
dumb.</p>

<p>"Really bad breakup. He…he's a vampire. With a soul."</p>

<p>She seemed worried about giving away more. "I think I'm better off not knowing details."</p>

<p>She sighed in relief. "He called her, but it doesn't have anything to do with them. Well,
not directly. Faith's trial starts today."</p>

<p>Whoa boy. Angst city there. I guess I must have looked confused, because Willow began to
apologize.</p>

<p>"Duh! You don't even know who she is! Sorry." Buffy was coming back over. "She's a
sensitive area for Buffy. Angel thinks she should be at the trial though."</p>

<p>She clamped her mouth shut, and pretended as if we hadn't spoken.</p>

<p>"I'm going." Buffy announced, and then glared at Giles.</p>

<p>"I think she would appreciate you being there, Buffy." Giles said. "Faith has been
unpredictable, but I have no reason to doubt what Angel says. And you saw her turn herself
in."</p>

<p>"What is it with you and logic?" Buffy asked him.</p>

<p>"We'll go with you." Willow said, referring to the two of us. "Backup support's always
good, right?"</p>

<p>Three days in this "reality" and I was already doing a crossover?</p>

<p>"I don't know if I should. I mean, you barely know me."</p>

<p>Was I trying to say I didn't want to go? Because that certainly wasn't what I was
thinking.</p>

<p>"No, it's okay. Might help. An unbiased, neutral opinion might keep me from doing
something incredibly stupid." Buffy said.</p>

<p>Unbiased? I didn't know about that. But I did know Faith's side of things and could
understand where she was coming from. Enough to be fair at least. And like I could stop
Buffy from doing anything.</p>

<p>"I'm in." I said simply.</p>

<p>"But first, he needs -" Willow started.</p>

<p>"A shower." Buffy said.</p>

<p>And as if on cue, Xander arrived with clothes.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>I came downstairs twenty minutes later, showered and dressed. I was wearing a “Sunnydale
High” T-shirt that was about two sizes too big, and baggy, leopard-spotted pants. I almost
tripped twice on the way down. Damn Xander. I had a scary thought that the pants were from
his male stripper days, which came as a result of his failed road trip. I felt like an
idiot, but of course, Buffy and Willow did nothing to make me feel any better.</p>

<p>They were holding back laughter, no, trying to. They weren’t doing a very good job of it.</p>

<p>“Well…you never know,” Buffy said in an attempt to be consoling, “you could start a
trend.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. You’re a pioneer.” Willow contributed.</p>

<p>“And I’ll have you know, those pants got me the most…uh…tips.” Xander added in his own
defense.</p>

<p>He got a glare from me.</p>

<p>I had been right then, about where the pants had come from, and I tried to shake away the
bad mental images. That pushed the girls over the edge. They laughed until they were red
in the face. Thankfully, Giles spared me any comments, but that didn’t change the fact
that I knew what he was thinking. Eventually, Buffy calmed down and wiped tears from her
eyes.</p>

<p>My embarrassment amused her. Wonderful.</p>

<p>“We’ll hit the mall after we back. I swear.” She grinned. “Courtesy of mom’s credit card.”</p>

<p>Willow saw how uncomfortable I was, and I think Xander was enjoying this. To get back at
me for mini-golf the other day.</p>

<p>“We ready?” I asked, already out the door.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>I had always wondered how one got from Sunnydale to LA, and it was by traveling by way of
the less than spectacular public transportation system. The bus was cramped and smelled
like urine, but for something that cost less than a dollar to ride, I guess I shouldn’t
have expected much. Still, hadn’t anybody ever heard of the word “sanitary”?</p>

<p>What I was really expecting, though, was that once we had crossed the town’s border, to be
in LA in less than a second. I mean, since it was a TV show, I had never seen outside of
the “one Starbucks” town. ANGEL, after all, was a completely different show. It had a
darker tone, a larger, more shadowy city…you know what I mean. But they were connected.</p>

<p>It was a two-hour ride to Angel’s city, and the three of us had seen enough “human”
weirdos to last us a lifetime.</p>

<p>Thinking back, it occurred to me that before my arrival, that I wasn’t even watching the
show at the time I left the familiar surroundings of my room. I was now convinced that I
wasn’t trapped within the confines of a two-hour long, “WB New Tuesday” programming
lineup. This was a world, and even though it wasn’t mine, it was very real. It existed
somewhere.</p>

<p>It was exciting, but scary. Vampires were real, a danger, and I didn’t even know if I
could get home.</p>

<p>Buffy, wanting to get her mind off what she was going to have to deal with in a few
minutes, noticed that I was preoccupied with these deep thoughts. We were walking to ANGEL
INVESTIGATIONS now, and she decided to ask me what exactly I was thinking about. That was
a mistake.</p>

<p>“Alternate dimensions.” I said calmly, not really thinking about what I was saying.</p>

<p>“I know I’ll probably regret this, but…why?” She asked.</p>

<p>Oh, this was fun.</p>

<p>“Uh…it’s a hobby?” Great answer.</p>

<p>“Collecting stamps is a hobby. It’s boring, but it’s a hobby.”</p>

<p>“So you’re saying you don’t buy the ‘dimensions’ thing.”</p>

<p>“Not for a second. But if it helps, they exist.”</p>

<p>Right. I remembered her trip to that Hell dimension in “Anne”. I needed to not talk about
this, anymore though, and the quicker I changed the subject, the better. Even though it
was going to get me into trouble.</p>

<p>“You’ll feel better if you just tell her. At least then –”</p>

<p>She didn’t waste any time. She clamped her hand over my mouth, which compromised my
balance for a second. She looked around for Willow frantically, and I turned to look as
well. Our companion was a few feet behind us, talking to a woman who was selling flowers
on the sidewalk. We ceased our walking, and stood there, waiting for her to complete her
transaction. Buffy turned to me, and spoke in a hushed voice.</p>

<p>“I can’t. It’s not something you tell your best *friend*. Especially when she’s with
someone else.”</p>

<p>“Hey, I’m not saying you have to take my advice, but let me ask you this. Did Napoleon
take over France by just talking about it?” She stared at me blankly. “No, he went in
there, and they handed the country over to him.”</p>

<p>“You’re saying, that if I tell her, she’ll just leave Tara for me?”</p>

<p>I shrugged. “Don’t know, but it sounded good, didn’t it?”</p>

<p>She shook her head at me, but she had a half-smile on her face.</p>

<p>“Hey guys.” We both jumped. Well actually, we just flinched in sync. “Whatcha talking
about?” Willow said to us.</p>

<p>I knew what Buffy was going to do.</p>

<p>“We were talking?” She asked me, playing dumb.</p>

<p>I had to go along with it. What? I didn’t want to have bruises for the next month.</p>

<p>“I don’t remember talking.”</p>

<p>She nodded to Willow. “See? No talk.”</p>

<p>“Uh huh…” Willow said skeptically.</p>

<p>The disbelieving redhead was carrying several flowers.</p>

<p>“What are they for?” I asked her, quickly.</p>

<p>“Buffy said that Angel’s office is a little on the dark and gloomy side. Brightening it up
can’t hurt, right?”</p>

<p>She then started walking ahead of us, and for a minute we just stood watching her in
amazement. If Buffy didn’t say anything to her, I was seriously considering saying
something. Willow was just…well anyway; we eventually got ourselves in gear, and began to
follow after her.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The three of us waited, rather uncomfortably, for Angel to come up from his basement home.
I had only seen one season of ANGEL so far, and I was a little more nervous in Los Angeles
than I was in Sunnydale. It was just different. There were no recognizable locations.
Well, the only one I had seen with any detail, besides the place I was currently standing
in, were the offices of Wolfram and Hart. I had no desire to set foot anywhere near there.</p>

<p>So like I said, we were waiting on Angel, looking at one another. From Cordelia to Wesley,
and back and forth. Tension. The brunette was never very fond of Buffy, and having grown
so much, I don’t think she liked being reminded of the past she left behind. Wesley also
left Sunnydale on less than pleasant terms, losing his Watcher title as a result of
meeting Buffy. Plus, I don’t think my presence, a stranger, helped much.</p>

<p>Willow decided she was going to break the silence.</p>

<p>“So…Faith…trial…”’</p>

<p>“Yes, who would have thought –” Wesley began.</p>

<p>“They better give her a long sentence.” Buffy said in a tone that implied that she
wouldn’t tolerate argument.</p>

<p>“She’s got my guilty vote.” Cordelia agreed. Then she spoke to me. It was the only thing
she said to me the entire time. “Xander dressed you, huh?”</p>

<p>I nodded with a grimace. Damn Xander.</p>

<p>There was a stillness then, because we all knew if there was a disagreement, a yelling
explosion would follow. And Wesley looked like he wanted to offer a counterpoint. I prayed
he wouldn’t, and I wasn’t even religious. That’s when Angel made his appearance, and
that’s when the tension reached a whole new level. Mainly between the two ex-lovers.</p>

<p>Angel saw me, and automatically knew I didn’t belong. That meant I was under suspicion,
and not even Buffy would be able to protect me. Anyhow, the brooding vampire and I got
into a staring match, until once again, Willow stepped in. I was muttering “thank yous”
under my breath. Angel’s eyes scrutinizing me…talk about intimidating.</p>

<p>“Hi, Angel. I brought flowers.” Willow said to him.</p>

<p>He finally looked away from me, and smiled at her. “Thanks. They look nice.”</p>

<p>Cordelia went to take them. “I’ll go put them in water…or something.” She hurried off.</p>

<p>“We going?” Buffy asked then. She wanted to be out of there, and frankly, so did I.</p>

<p>“In a minute.” Angel answered her.</p>

<p>His eyes shifted to me again, and then he walked into his office. I knew I was supposed to
follow, even though I really didn’t want to.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Once I was inside, he gestured to the empty chair that was in front of his desk. I sat,
and placed my crutches on the floor. He watched. He shut the door, and sat on the edge of
his desk, getting as close to me as possible, to be as intimidating as possible, without
being completely in my face. I didn’t like where this was leading. After a few moments, he
looked at my bandaged wrists.</p>

<p>“Sunnydale’s Vampire Welcome Wagon.” I answered his unvoiced question.</p>

<p>“Where are you from?” He asked, speaking to me for the first time.</p>

<p>No introductions or pleasantries. He got right to it. I usually liked that about him, but
not right now, obviously. I knew he could see there was something I was hiding, so I
figured it was better if I was straight with him.</p>

<p>“Pennsylvania.”</p>

<p>“Where are you from?”</p>

<p>He wanted the truth; he was going to get it. I’d give him an out, first, though.</p>

<p>“It’s complicated. I am from there, but not…look it’s just complicated.”</p>

<p>“Try me. I’m a complicated guy.”</p>

<p>I took a deep breath before going further.</p>

<p>“I know.” He was silent, knowing I had more to say. “You’re a two-hundred and forty-seven
year old, souled vampire. You fed off a gypsy in Romania in 1898, while your sire, Darla,
watched. You were cursed some time later by her clan, and some hundred years later, you
were in New York, starving. Four years ago, a guide from the Powers That Be came to you.
His name was Whistler.” I stopped, looking for a reaction from him.</p>

<p>He seemed to study me. “You’re not a demon.”</p>

<p>“Nope. Just a kid who watches a lot of TV. I don’t know why I’m here, but I am.”</p>

<p>If he was surprised that I knew such intimate details of his life, or unlife rather, he
didn’t show it.</p>

<p>“Different dimension?” I shrugged. Probably, but I wasn’t sure. “You didn’t tell them.”</p>

<p>I frowned. He made it seem like a bad thing. “Seemed like a good idea at the time.”</p>

<p>His face remained stoic. “After.” He got off his desk.</p>

<p>Tell them after the trial? I gulped, and reached for my crutches. Arguing would have done
me no good. At least this meant I wasn’t considered a threat, and he probably had things
he wanted to ask me, but he had other things on his mind at the moment. Telling them would
change everything, but I don’t think he was giving me a choice.</p>

<p>“Okay.” I said, giving in.</p>

<p>He opened the door, and went out ahead of me. I was right behind him.</p>

<p>“Nice clothes, by the way.”</p>

<p>I could hear the amusement in his voice. Damn Xander.</p>

<p>“Oh, my name’s Pat. It’s good to finally meet you. Liam.”</p>

<p>He turned around sharply, looking at me in disbelief because I knew his real name.
Finally, I got a reaction out of him. Shook him up some, and needless to say, I was very
pleased with myself.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Wesley came along with us to the courthouse. Buffy stuck close to Willow because she
didn’t want to be in a position where she’d have to talk to Angel, but it did give Buffy a
chance to tell Willow what her feelings were. Even though I knew she wasn’t going to.
Angel, Wesley and I reached the door to the courtroom first, and watched Kate Lockley and
two other officers lead Faith in. She was handcuffed.</p>

<p>Wolfram and Hart was a defense firm, and I knew they wouldn’t be involved. Not in any
open, legal way. I looked over at Buffy, and she was looking at Faith with so much hatred,
I felt a chill. The two slayers locked eyes, and Faith got the brunt of that chill before
disappearing into the room. I hated someone too, but it wasn’t the Bostonian. It was Kate.</p>

<p>I know she lost her father, and I felt bad for her and understood her attitude towards
Angel for awhile, but then she took it too far. I hoped that she would take out her claws
soon, because she and Angel could be allies, perhaps more. They were alike in a lot of
ways.</p>

<p>Where was I? Oh, then we all filed in, and took a seat in the back. I found myself sitting
next to a handless Lindsey MacDonald. I almost screamed. He hadn’t acknowledged my
presence, but I knew he was there, and I really wanted to move. Willow was sitting on my
other side, Angel next to her, then Wesley, and Buffy on the end. Willow looked at me,
confused at my sudden discomfort, and I shook my head. I’d just have to put up with the
seating arrangement.</p>

<p>Or I thought I would. He pulled out his cell-phone, said something quietly to the person
on the other end, and got up, brushing past us all. He didn’t look very happy, and seeing
Angel didn’t help his mood. But he left without a word. Willow had been watching too, and
she turned to me after he was out of view.</p>

<p>“Did you just get the feeling that he isn’t a very nice guy?” She asked me.</p>

<p>I nodded in agreement. “And the way he and Angel looked at each other…”</p>

<p>“What happened to his hand?”</p>

<p>I knew, and before I had an answer, the judge came in, and we were rising. When she told
us to sit again, and the case was announced, the DA asked permission to approach the
bench. After hearing what he had to say, the judge called up Faith’s lawyer to her bench
as well. We were wondering what was going on. I couldn’t see Faith’s face, but I knew she
was probably nervous as hell.</p>

<p>“This is weird.” Willow said to me.</p>

<p>We were whispering.</p>

<p>“Yeah.” I agreed. I don’t know what made me go where I went next, but I did. “Your friend
Tara seems nice. Did I make her nervous? She didn’t talk much the other night.”</p>

<p>“Oh no. She’s just shy.” She was hesitant, I could tell. “And we’re not friends. Well, not
just friends.”</p>

<p>I pretended to let it dawn on me. “You’re involved?” She nodded. “That’s great.”</p>

<p>She smiled. “Yeah…it is. But I think Buffy’s still having a hard time…accepting.”</p>

<p>“You really think that’s it?”</p>

<p>That question really got her attention, but before we could continue, the judge was
addressing the room.</p>

<p>“Would the defendant please stand?” The judge asked Faith.</p>

<p>She did, and we all waited.</p>

<p>“I’ve been informed that due to a lack of evidence and potential witnesses unwilling to
step forward and testify, the District Attorney doesn’t feel confident enough to form a
case against you. I get the feeling that there is more affecting this case that I’m aware
of, but nevertheless, I have no choice but to declare a mistrial. You’re free, Miss
Wilkins.”</p>

<p>We gaped.</p>

<p>“I have heard your confession, however. I have no idea what possessed you to admit to
those crimes, but if there’s any truth to what you said, I feel as if I haven’t done my
job. But the law has its rules, and its decided to give you a second chance. I suggest
that you make the most of it. And I think it’s important that you understand that very few
people get this break.</p>

<p>“I also hope that you learned something from your few months of incarceration, and have no
desire to return there, because I guarantee you, if I ever see you in my courtroom again,
you’ll be removed from society for a very long time. Am I making myself clear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your honor.” Faith answered, her voice small.</p>

<p>“Good.” She banged her gavel, and everyone started to clear out.</p>

<p>On the way out, I heard Buffy talking to Angel.</p>

<p>“Did you have anything to do with this?”</p>

<p>“No.” He said simply, and walked ahead.</p>

<p>I caught up with her, and she saw me.</p>

<p>“I hope she realizes how lucky she is.” She was obviously angry.</p>

<p>“I’m sure she does.” I told Buffy.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>We all waited in the Los Angeles Police Department’s parking garage, for Angel and Faith.
He went inside with her to get her possessions. I didn’t think she had that many, yet they
were taking awhile. The tapping of Buffy’s foot against the asphalt by Angel’s convertible
was driving us all crazy. I knew she had a lot of feelings towards Faith, the main one at
the moment probably being jealousy (she was getting Angel’s undivided attention), but
she’d have to accept the fact that things were happening she would have no say in.</p>

<p>Finally, we saw the two of them, and Angel was carrying a duffel bag. Faith stared at the
ground as she walked to the car, not looking at any of us. He tossed the bag on the floor
by the passenger seat, and she hopped into the back. She slowly lifted her head, and
looked at Buffy. Seeing less than welcoming eyes looking back at her, she quickly looked
away.</p>

<p>Something popped into my head as I looked at Faith. It didn’t really have anything to do
with her; the thought had come more as a result of another uncomfortable silence. They
seemed common here. And during these moments of quiet, I had taken to ponder the existence
of this place, which was what I was doing now. If this was a “real” world, separate from
the one had viewed on my 13-inch box, what the hell was going on?</p>

<p>Anyway, there wasn’t enough room in the car for all of us. One more could go in the back
with Faith, and Wesley was going to ride in the passenger seat. From the looks on both
Buffy and Willow’s faces, it didn’t seem like they were going to fight over the spot.</p>

<p>“We’ll walk, and meet you there.” Buffy announced.</p>

<p>The two friends looked at me.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll ride. I’d be exhausted by the time we got there.”</p>

<p>Sweating and everything. Wouldn’t have been a pretty sight.</p>

<p>Wesley was gracious enough to help me in, and Faith and I exchanged awkward “hellos”. I
assured Buffy that I’d be okay, and then grabbing Willow’s hand, they started to walk. A
minute or so later, Angel started the car, and we were off, easily passing the two girls.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>She must have gotten the impression that I wasn’t going to judge her or that I had any
hatred towards her, because she started talking to me.</p>

<p>“Got Irish in ya?” She asked.</p>

<p>I was surprised. “How’d you know?”</p>

<p>“Could tell. Got the look. Name wouldn’t be Pat, would it?”</p>

<p>“Uh…yeah.” She was good.</p>

<p>“No way.” She seemed happy with the accuracy of her guess. “Bet you can hold your liquor
too.”</p>

<p>She was electric.</p>

<p>“Never tried.”</p>

<p>She wasn’t the same Faith though. The playfulness was still in her eyes, but I knew she
wasn’t going to drag me to a bar and get me hammered, act on her words, as she might have
done a year ago.</p>

<p>“Just kidding ya.” The smile disappeared. “How much did she tell you?”</p>

<p>“You’re apparently a sore spot.”</p>

<p>She chuckled. “She gave you the clean version.”</p>

<p>“Actually, Willow did.”</p>

<p>“Right. Red. They get their act together?”</p>

<p>What was she talking about? “Her and Tara?”</p>

<p>“No, I called that. Her and B. Looks like it finally got through.”</p>

<p>I nodded. “To Buffy? Yeah.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t tell her though, right?”</p>

<p>“How the hell…?”</p>

<p>“See, that was always the problem. No matter how much I tried to squeeze into her life, no
matter how close to the edge I got her, Red was always on her mind, and she stopped. I
wish I had someone to pull me back.”</p>

<p>How come I sensed that a change was coming in the conversation?</p>

<p>“You were in that courtroom. I know I should feel pretty damn lucky, but I wish I was
still in jail. I don’t deserve this.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“You don’t know what I did.”</p>

<p>She was closing off. Bad.</p>

<p>“Don’t have to. You deserve it.”</p>

<p>“Oh yeah?” I got her attention. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Cause you’re sorry for whatever you did.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t say I was.” She was confused.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to say the words to be sorry. The fact that you don’t think you deserve to
be out of jail, means that you care about what you did. That means you’re sorry for ever
doing it, and that’s why you deserve a second chance.”</p>

<p>She was blown away. “Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Just an eighteen year old kid with an Irish name.” I said with a smile.</p>

<p>I couldn’t see Angel in the rearview mirror, but I knew he was smiling at me. I was pretty
sure, because Wesley was. We were coming up on our destination.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Faith and I were sitting on the couch in Angel’s home, both watching Buffy pace back in
forth in front of us, her eyes fixed on Faith. Willow stood by my side of the couch, Angel
stood behind it, and Wesley was upstairs on the phone with potential clients.</p>

<p>Buffy was pacing because she was waiting for Faith’s answer on what she wanted to do. But
how could Faith make a decision under Buffy’s despising glare?</p>

<p>“Look at her.” I said to Buffy.</p>

<p>Both slayers looked at me now.</p>

<p>“What?” Buffy asked.</p>

<p>“Look at her. Really look.”</p>

<p>“What do you think I’ve been doing?”</p>

<p>“We’ll leave you two alone.” Angel said.</p>

<p>Willow, Angel and I walked into his bedroom and he closed the door. Willow sat on the bed
and sighed. It had been about a half an hour of silence, before Angel decided to break it.</p>

<p>“Do you think she’s changed?” He asked Willow.</p>

<p>“Seems like it, but with Faith…” Willow shrugged.</p>

<p>How could she think any different? She didn’t see Faith weep in the alleyway, begging
Angel to kill her. But Willow didn’t have the hatred Buffy had for the other slayer. Not
anymore, so she must seen some flicker of change in her.</p>

<p>“Maybe you should tell her.” He said next.</p>

<p>Angel was speaking to both of us. I knew what he meant for me, but I don’t think Willow
understood.</p>

<p>“Huh?” She asked him.</p>

<p>He smiled knowingly. “Think about it.”</p>

<p>I had to grin, when it clicked for me. He was talking about Buffy. Willow had the same
feelings for her, as she had for Willow? Angel seemed to think so, and he was hardly ever
wrong when it came to people. I wouldn’t have picked up on it, but that’s why he was the
vampire detective, and I wasn’t.</p>

<p>I cringed now, because I knew it was my turn. I sat next to Willow, and took a deep
breath.</p>

<p>“There’s something I gotta tell you. Well, everyone.” She looked worried. “It’s nothing
bad…”</p>

<p>“You can come in now, guys.” Buffy called.</p>

<p>I was relieved. Wouldn’t you be?</p>

<p>“When we get back.” I said to Willow after we heard the blonde’s voice.</p>

<p>She nodded and walked out, and I turned to Angel. “I will.”</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>We saw two slayers with tear-stained faces. When I saw the smiles, I wanted to cry. The
tension between them was gone, you could feel it. They looked exhausted. There hadn’t been
any screaming, which was a surprise. We would have heard them if there had been. But it
had been a heated discussion obviously, and apparently, a lot of emotions had gone into
it. I was glad.</p>

<p>Willow looked at Buffy, and then at Faith. She walked up to the brunette, and looked at
her for a few seconds. We were getting worried, and then Willow gave her a hug. When it
was over, Faith stood there, absorbing everything. She saw me, and smiled, shaking her
head in disbelief.</p>

<p>“I told you.” I said.</p>

<p>“What do you want to do?” Angel asked Faith.</p>

<p>“Uh…you hiring?” She asked. “Sunnydale’s got a slayer. A good one.” She didn’t look at
Buffy as she said that. “And I owe you.”</p>

<p>“You don’t owe me anything.”</p>

<p>“Whatever.” She shrugged. “But I want to do the right thing this time, be on the light
side, and…stick with it.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear that. It’ll probably be difficult, though.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know. Anyway…I think this is a good place to start. And considering you have a
cheerleader and a…well, do you want another employee or not?” She looked unsure.</p>

<p>“I could use your help. Thank you.”</p>

<p>Faith was surprised that she was being thanked. I thought to myself that she was probably
going to be hearing that a lot now. Buffy spoke next.</p>

<p>“You know that if you ever want to…it won’t be easy, but…” She trailed off.</p>

<p>She was making an effort to close the gap between them. It was nice to see.</p>

<p>Faith grinned. “Don’t worry, B. I’ll stop by. Who knows when I’ll need to save your ass?”
She looked at Willow. “Willow, I’m…”</p>

<p>Willow smiled. “I know. Thanks.”</p>

<p>The Bostonian cleared her throat. “B, Red, I’ll catch ya later. There’s…uh…a couple people
upstairs I gotta talk to.” She started headed for the stairs, and then turned around. She
looked at Buffy and Willow. “Hope you two are happy with…whatever.”</p>

<p>I had to contain my laughter when I saw the expressions on Buffy and Willow’s faces as
they looked at one another.</p>

<p>“And Pat…thanks.” Then she made a face. “But who dressed you? A circus monkey?”</p>

<p>“He may be. I’m not sure yet.”</p>

<p>Damn Xander.</p>

<p>She headed up as I glared at Buffy and Willow, cutting off any laughter from them. A few
minutes later, Angel opened the basement exit, and we were leaving. I told the two of them
to wait for me on the corner, and then we’d walk to the bus station, because I had
something to say to Angel first.</p>

<p>“You helped her out a lot.” He said to me, referring to Faith. “But if you don’t tell
them, I will.”</p>

<p>I nodded. “I do wanna go home eventually, you know.”</p>

<p>“Hope you get there. Good luck.”</p>

<p>“Probably won’t see you again, so I just thought I’d let you know, Darla’s in the box.
Good luck with that. Got a feeling you’re probably gonna need it.”</p>

<p>And then I walked after the girls, not looking back.</p>
