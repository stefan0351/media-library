<p>Buffy was roused from her slumber by a
hand on her arm that was trying to shake her awake. As she slowly opened
her eyes, the massive morning hangover headache hit her like a Mack truck.
She hadn't gotten THAT drunk last night, had she? Certainly not as badly
as she had during her "devolving experience". Being a Slayer helped, because
after about a minute, the cobwebs cleared, and the pounding lessened some.</p>
<p>Then she remembered the previous night.
She and Faith mixing drinks, having somewhat of a bonding conversation
thanks to some loosening up by aforementioned drinks, and then Faith had…she
had…pulled her down, and viciously, forcefully, and with a loving touch
in there too, had attacked Buffy's mouth with her tongue, and wouldn't
stop. And Buffy had let it happen. Wait. Who was she kidding? She had been
a very willing participant. Damn, it had felt good.</p>
<p>It had felt really good. And now the guilt
was setting in. The confusion. Oh, and the guilt. She suddenly went wide-eyed,
wondering how far they had actually gone. When she looked down at her body
and still found herself fully clothed, she sighed in relief. That's when
she remembered more. The seemingly never-ending kiss had ended. Faith was
the one who stopped it. While Buffy was trying to remember how to breathe,
Faith had mumbled a good night, and laid on the floor.</p>
<p>Faith. Where was she? She looked around
frantically now, seeing no sign of the other slayer. That's when she began
to worry.</p>
<p>"Buffy?" She focused on Willow now, who
was standing over her. "What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"Faith, where is she?"</p>
<p>"She came and got us up like an hour ago.
She said she was going to go for a walk, and that you were still asleep."
Tara said, who had come into view.</p>
<p>"What time is it?</p>
<p>"Uh…noon. We cleaned up. Looks like you
had fun last night." Willow said.</p>
<p>'You have no…whoo boy.' "Why didn't you
come down?" 'You could've stopped us.'</p>
<p>"Sorry, but I was teaching. You know how
I get."</p>
<p>"I'm not computer illiterate anymore, that's
for sure." Tara said; her brain still a little fried.</p>
<p>Buffy, despite the flood of emotions running
through her, managed to crack a small smile. "That's Will's other passion.
You have my sympathy."</p>
<p>"Hey!" Willow looked somewhat offended,
but then grinned slightly.</p>
<p>"I didn't mind. Not many people are as
passionate as…she…I mean, about things, as she is. It's nice." Tara said
slowly.</p>
<p>Buffy saw Willow smile widely at Tara.
Oh yeah. Faith had the two of them pegged. She wanted to say something.
Did Willow get the depth of feeling Tara had for her? The poor girl was
so nervous, Buffy saw. But she couldn't intrude on her friend's life like
that. A relationship had to develop on its own. At its own pace. Their
moment would come.</p>
<p>Was that what she and Faith had? A moment?
An opening of possibilities? But her and Faith? No, that was crazy. She
was in a very fulfilling, and happy, relationship with…Riley. God, Riley.
Well, he slept with Faith, and she kissed Faith. They were even. She quickly
realized how wrong that reasoning was. A relationship with Faith would
never happen anyway. It had been the drinks, and Faith was a 'get some
and get gone' type of girl.</p>
<p>But Faith had stopped the kiss. She hadn't
used her. So what did that mean?</p>
<p>"We're gonna go back to campus." Willow
said.</p>
<p>"Yeah, okay. We'll meet up later." Buffy
said, trying to get her thoughts in order.</p>
<p>What was Faith thinking? Where was she?</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Spike came to on the dorm room floor. Shaking
his head he wondered if Forrest had double-crossed him. He didn't
feel any different, but he guessed he wouldn't know that until he had a
chance to experiment. Standing up, he smelled the sun. And then he felt
the rays hit him through the window. He quickly shut the blinds, frustrated
that he'd have to wait.</p>
<p>Then he heard voices. Willow's voice. And
somebody else's. He had to get out of there. Now. He heard them get closer
to the door.</p>
<p>"Let me grab some Tagis root and we'll
go to your room and try that new spell." He heard Willow say.</p>
<p>"I have some, don't worry about it." The
other girl said.</p>
<p>"Oh. Cool."</p>
<p>Their footsteps got softer as they walked
down the hall. Spike would've taken a deep breath and prayed in thanks
if he were still alive and not evil. He quickly opened the door and looked
down both ends of hall. They were gone. He took off down the opposite end,
and ran into the stairwell.</p>
<p>He'd waited months to kill again. A couple
more hours couldn't hurt.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"Why do I always have to screw things up?"
Faith asked herself walking down Main Street.</p>
<p>She had a good thing going with Buffy.
They were friends again. They were slaying. They were hanging. Then she
had to go take advantage of her. To relieve her own "needs". That was what
she was doing? Right? That's who she was. A user. One good lay, no emotional
attachment whatsoever. But…she didn't go all the way with Buffy. She stopped,
and she didn't know why. Well, she did, but she wasn't going to let that
surface again.</p>
<p>The Bostonian slayer had been drawn to
Buffy the first time she laid eyes on her. When she saw the walls Buffy
had built around herself, the rigid, defensive attitude, she had devoted
herself to breaking through it using whatever methods were necessary. And
she had gotten under Buffy's skin pretty well. That's when the bottle blonde
started to befriend her, and Faith started to like her. But she still pushed
Buffy's limits.</p>
<p>She needed to see if Buffy would crumble
under her taunts or hold her own. Faith had this way of either causing
people to stay away from her, or making people lose themselves. But Buffy
didn't do either of those things. And Faith continually grew to like and
respect her. Buffy was strong, and her own woman. Something Faith wanted
to find for herself. Because she wasn't strong.</p>
<p>Wesley had shown up, and that's when Buffy
started to get drawn to Faith's way of life. And what a pitiful life it
was. She was screaming inside for Buffy to run away from her. Buffy was
too good for using her body to get a group of guys hot and bothered, to
skip school, to rebel, to steal, all the things Faith had built her life
around. But it didn't matter if she was screaming inside, on the outside,
she loved the fact that Buffy was with her. And she hated it too.</p>
<p>After the murder, Faith had no choice but
sink deeper, but Buffy pulled herself out. She had been strong enough to
do that and to try and save Faith at the same time. It was then that Faith
got hit with it. Love. Buffy Summers still cared about her after she had
screwed up, and unlike Faith, still had that strength. But Faith didn't
know how to deal with the love, because she had never felt it before. And
by then, she was too far-gone.</p>
<p>So she turned the love, the respect, into
the one thing she had always been good at. Hate. It was so simple. While
she was killing people or hurting Buffy, it was killing her inside. Even
if Buffy had reciprocated her feelings, Faith still wouldn't have been
able to deal with it. She used people. Guys and girls alike. But she didn't
want to do that with Buffy. And she was afraid that she would end up doing
just that, no matter how hard she tried not to.</p>
<p>It was who she was. Buffy wouldn't love
a screwed up person like her anyway. She had to push down her emotions.
She didn't love. She knew Buffy had responded to the kiss, but she was
under the influence and not thinking clearly. But Faith would always remember
that kiss. She could still feel it. But she also had to remember that life
wasn't fair, and that Buffy had a boyfriend.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Riley looked up from his desk when his
dorm room door flew open. Three people, led by Forrest, rushed into the
room, and began pulling stuff out of his closet, and removing the bedspread.
They took down his mini-basketball net off the door, and continued to remove
everything until the room was bare.</p>
<p>He watched for a few minutes as this was
going on, and then watched as Graham walked behind him, and cuffed his
hands together. Forrest stood in front of him. Riley stayed silent, not
bothering to fight. It would have been pointless. He knew the protocol.</p>
<p>Special Agent Riley Finn," Forrest began,
"you are being taken into custody by order of the United States Military.
You are charged with crime of treason against your country, by releasing
classified materials to one Buffy Anne Summers, who is considered a threat
to national security. Do you deny these charges?"</p>
<p>"Who told you?" Riley asked, monotone.</p>
<p>"Do you have anything to say in your defense
before you're brought to a higher court where sentencing will be carried
out?"</p>
<p>"You and I both know that's not what's
going to happen. So let's get it over with."</p>
<p>"You heard the prisoner."</p>
<p>Forrest led the way to the mirror that
was the entrance to the elevator,which carried them down to the Initiative.
When Forrest's retinal scan was completed; they all entered the elevator
and went below.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"What is it you want me to look for exactly?"
Giles asked Buffy later at his home.</p>
<p>Olivia, his girlfriend, was on her way
back to England. Her plane had taken off just over an hour ago. It had
been a very enjoyable week for him, because he didn't get to see her very
often. His good mood had faltered somewhat when Buffy had come over. She
seemed distraught.</p>
<p>"Slayer stuff. You know."</p>
<p>"I thought I had gotten pretty adept at
interpreting your vague explanations, but this has once again thrown me
off course. Could you please be more specific?"</p>
<p>"Were you trying to be funny? Cause if
you were I picked up on it."</p>
<p>Buffy thought about going to Riley's after
leaving her house, but the guilt would have been unbearable. She even considered
kissing him to compare. But that wasn't fair. If she did that she would've
hated herself for using Riley in that way. It was also unfair to Faith,
because if she had gone to Riley and kissed him, she would have been trying
to push the kiss she and Faith had shared out of her mind. And she didn't
want to forget it. At least not until they talked and figured things out.</p>
<p>Something had prompted her to return Faith's
kiss, and it wasn't just the alcohol as she had tried to reason earlier.
She didn't know what it was, but she intended to find out. Her next thought
had been that since the two of them were both slayers, maybe they had a
chemical imbalance…or something. She knew she was grasping at straws, but
she needed an explanation. And as much as she didn't want to, she knew
Giles was the only one who would have a clue.</p>
<p>"What do you want to know?" Giles asked.</p>
<p>"Do slayers have…a bond with each other?"</p>
<p>"You're the first slayer in history to
fight alongside a second slayer. It used to be that slayers never actually
came in contact with one another. Or, if they did, it wasn't documented."</p>
<p>"So you're saying you know zip."</p>
<p>"On the contrary, you and Faith have proven
that there is without a doubt some form of connection between slayers.
The dream you shared in the hospital last year, and more recently, the…nightmare,
that played out in a rather prophetic fashion later."</p>
<p>"Okay…so dreams. But…I didn't have them
with Kendra."</p>
<p>"Hmmm…that's true. Well, maybe you weren't
meant to. Perhaps whatever bond slayers have only activates when both slayers
feel certain emotions. A personal connection would be just as important
as a 'built in' one, so to speak. The bond could then be triggered that
way."</p>
<p>Buffy paled. Did that mean -? "I still
don't get it."</p>
<p>"It's simply a theory, but Kendra was a
very closed off person emotionally."</p>
<p>"So's Faith."</p>
<p>"There's a difference between being open
about your feelings and showing emotion. Faith was not very open with any
of us about her true feelings at first. She is just now, starting to do
that. But she had no problem showing emotion, which might be why your bond
grew in strength.</p>
<p>"Kendra on the other hand, controlled her
emotions very carefully, as all slayers are trained to do, so the bond
was never established. If she wanted you to see her feelings, and had been
more emotionally driven, you probably would have built the connection.
Also, she was not around very long. It might take time."</p>
<p>"Now that I think about it, I can just
'feel' what Faith's planning to do when we slay. It's like we're…a force."</p>
<p>It's like I just let go and became this
force.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know what that's like.</p>
<p>I don't think you can. It's kind of…</p>
<p>"A Slayer Thing." Buffy whispered, remembering
the conversation she had had with Willow and Xander right before she went
with Faith to the vampire nest last year.</p>
<p>"What was that?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. So you think this bond has to
do with us as people too? Not just cause we're slayers?"</p>
<p>"That would be my guess. Why the sudden
interest?"</p>
<p>"Just something that's been on my mind.
Thanks. You helped."</p>
<p>He helped, but he also scared her. Did
that mean that she loved Faith and that the bond had grown over the past
month bringing her feelings to the surface? Was it because Faith started
showing her who she really was? Is that why she responded to the kiss?
Faith was attractive, and there was no denying that, but why now? Why period?
She knew one thing for certain. There were too many questions and not enough
answers.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Willow returned to the dorm after she had
finished spell casting with Tara. She loved being with her friend. When
she was around it was like all the evil forces that surrounded her and
her life, disappeared. A cloud of happiness was the only force, and it
clearly dominated over all the others. She hadn't felt that way for awhile.
Not since…</p>
<p>Something wasn't right. The door had been
closed before. She lost her train of thought as she entered and scanned
the room. Everything seemed normal, but it didn't 'feel' right. She walked
over to the window. The blind was pulled down. Had it been down before?</p>
<p>She walked to the closet. Normal in there
too. Except…she looked at the ceiling. The vent covering was off. How…that's
where they kept the files Riley gave them.</p>
<p>Uh oh. She had to call Buffy. And then
get Riley. Fast. She got the phone, and dialed Buffy's number. There was
no answer. Where would she go? Willow tried Giles' then. It was too early
for Buffy to be anywhere else. Besides, it was a Saturday.</p>
<p>"Giles? Hi. Is Buffy there?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Faith now found herself at the docks. She
had toyed with the idea of skipping town, but it quickly passed. Once Buffy
said it would be too hard to be around her, and that the kiss was a mistake,
then she would leave. But she was hesitant because she wanted to be sure
that's what Buffy thought. She was in too deep now, and she wouldn't run
from the best thing that had happened to her until her assumptions were
confirmed. Right now she couldn't trust her assumptions or her instincts.</p>
<p>She loved Buffy. But was it really love?
What if it was just her regular lust she was trying to disguise as love?
What if…damn. She was questioning too much, and her head was pounding.
She had to sit before she went crazy. She couldn't face Buffy yet. She
sat on a bench that faced a dockside warehouse, but she was too absorbed
to see the eyes watching her from inside the warehouse.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>In the complex, Riley sat in a containment
cell on the floor. Only the highest officials in the military and CIA knew
the Initiative existed. That's how he knew there wouldn't be a trial. His
"betrayal" would be taken care of internally and quietly. He knew after
he had been dealt with the group would get back on track, and then Buffy
would be next. So he had to hang on as long as possible. He saw Forrest
sit against the wall beside his cell.</p>
<p>"So this is how you treat family?" Riley
asked.</p>
<p>"I warned you, man. The chick was bad news.
This is for the greater good."</p>
<p>"Leave her out of this. It has nothing
to do with her. This whole operation's dirty, and you know it. We created
a killer that's gathering HST's, and it's only a matter of time before
he comes back."</p>
<p>"He'll be dealt with. We fix our own mistakes."</p>
<p>"Then what are you waiting for?"</p>
<p>"You have a stay of execution. I think
you need some time to get your priorities in order. Maybe, if you promise
to mend your ways, we can work something out."</p>
<p>"Hey, Forrest?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Don't let your new position go to your
head. We both know that people with power usually end up dead. Don't we?"</p>
<p>Forrest stood up, and looked in at Riley.
"One day."</p>
<p>Then he walked away, leaving Riley alone
with his thoughts.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"Who told you?" Buffy asked, bursting into
Forrest's dorm room and shoving him against the wall.</p>
<p>"That's classified."</p>
<p>"Okay. How about this? Where is Riley?"</p>
<p>"You know where he is. But you can't get
to him."</p>
<p>"Sure about that?"</p>
<p>"I'd be careful who you mangle, girl. If
I'm not mistaken, you have a record. Colorful one too. One false move,
and bye-bye college. Your boy's safe for now, but if you have any brains
at all, you'll stay away." "I've survived things you can only dream of."</p>
<p>"You can't survive a gun shot. And neither
can he. If any one of us suspects you might be getting any ideas about
some kind of rescue, he dies."</p>
<p>"How do I know you aren't planning to do
that anyway?"</p>
<p>"I guess you don't." He pushed her off,
and she cautiously left the room.</p>
<p>She cursed her own stupidity. She should
have been with Riley. She had been so wrapped up in trying to figure out
the 'her and Faith' thing, and now the guilt had multiplied. She was worried
for him, and she couldn't do anything.</p>
<p>There was only one person Buffy could think
of who could know where the files had been, and only one person who would
even think about ratting her out. She thought it was about time they had
a little chat. It was long overdue.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>The sun had gone down, and over by the
docks, Faith still sat, thinking. That's when Spike exited the warehouse,
smiling at her.</p>
<p>"I thought we came to understanding, Fangless."
Faith said.</p>
<p>"Things change. I think it's time we had
a go. It should be more even this time around." He shifted into game face,
and she was instantly on guard, not caring how he came to be back in action.</p>
<p>"I'm ready. I need a distraction. You'll
keep me busy for a few minutes anyway."</p>
<p>Spike growled angrily, and charged her.</p>

<p>"I'm being babysat now?" Riley asked Graham.</p>
<p>They were the only two people left in the
complex now. The rest of the members were either on assignment on just
going about their lives. Not Riley though. He had lost track of how long
he had been down there. Long enough, he figured, for it to be past nightfall.
That meant Buffy was either slaying, or knew he was contained and was trying
to figure out how to get him out. He hoped she wouldn't try anything, but
he knew she would.</p>
<p>He'd have to try and make things easier
for her then.</p>
<p>"It's the way it has to be. You know that
better than any of us."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but that was before I found out
we were all lied to."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"We were taken from other assignments to
this town, and told that it was because we were the best. We were going
to handle the problems the majority of the public would rather not know
about. Demons. No...they told us they were animals. Dangerous animals,
nothing more than that.</p>
<p>"But they are more than that. They're intelligent,
resourceful, capable of things that...I couldn't even imagine in a nightmare.
They've been around for a real long time, and most of them want nothing
more than to kill for fun. Or end the world. But we don't kill these threats.</p>
<p>"We cage them and experiment on them. To
learn. To create super soldiers. But the prototype must have gotten a few
wires crossed, because he's loose, indestructible, and kills anything and
everything. Instead of helping mankind to survive, we're helping to destroy
it. You don't see anything wrong in that?"</p>
<p>"Nice speech."</p>
<p>"Come on, Graham. We've all been played,
and I know you. I watched your back; I've saved your life. We're friends.
Forrest has always been a loose cannon. Always wanted the highest rank,
and given the opportunity, he would do anything to get it. And he has.
You're better than that. I know you are. You know this isn't right."</p>
<p>Graham's resolve was melting. "You just
want out."</p>
<p>"I don't think it's a secret that I don't
want to be in here, but believe what you want."</p>
<p>Graham stood there for another second,
and quietly walked away to think.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Faith bent over, and Spike was moving so
fast that he did the only thing he could think of. He tried to jump over
her. She straightened up, grabbed his leg as he was in midair, and tossed
him down. She kicked him in the stomach quickly, but he just as quickly
got to his feet.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, his hands were
on her shirt, and he threw her over his head. She was able to flip enough
so she landed upright. She had a small grin on her face as she turned around
to face him, proceeded to pull a stake out of her leather jacket, and then
they circled one another.</p>
<p>"You're a tricky one aren't you, pet?"</p>
<p>"And you're just as dumb as you look. I
thought that hair cut was bad before, but with the ridges, it looks wicked
gross."</p>
<p>He reached forward and grabbed her stake-free
arm. She used the butt of the stake to hit has face, and he let go when
it connected. She grabbed his wrist, twisted, and he had no choice but
to move behind her so she wouldn't tear his hand off.</p>
<p>"Oh please. You're a randy slut. You've
wanted to shag me as soon as you saw me."</p>
<p>"Don't flatter yourself. A girl has needs.
You were just a convenient toy at the time. There are other ways to get
off. Seeing you squirm did the job just fine."</p>
<p>He head-butted her, and she stumbled backward,
releasing his wrist. He took advantage of her temporarily stunned state,
and swept her legs, making her fall on her back. He stood over her.</p>
<p>"No, you didn't want me, did you? You want
the blonde bitch. You want to shag her, discard her, and add another name
to your list."</p>
<p>"Don't call her that!" She kicked her leg
up, connecting with his groin. He dropped to one knee, and she flipped
forward back to her feet, roundhouse kicked him in the side of the head,
and he fell on his side. "And I wouldn't do that to her. I won't."</p>
<p>"You're only fooling herself. What? You
think you love her? That's bloody rich. You have no idea what that is."</p>
<p>"And you do?"</p>
<p>"You. d be surprised."</p>
<p>She bent down over him. "I do love her.
And if it ever...it won't be screwing."</p>
<p>"How will you know the difference?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. Guess I'll have to wait
and see." She picked him up and thew him over the side of the docks. He
hung on by his hands, keeping himself from falling down into the water
below. "What's the matter, little rusty?" She stepped on his hand hard,
making him lose half of his grip.</p>
<p>"God...I hate slayers."</p>
<p>Faith was quiet then. After a few seconds,
he began to wonder what was going on. Then he felt a hand reach down, and
he had no other than to grab it. He was dragged up back onto the docks,
and stood up. Buffy was staring him in the face.</p>
<p>"How's the soldier?" He asked smugly.</p>
<p>"Dumb move." Buffy said.</p>
<p>She pushed him back hard into the warehouse
wall, and used her weight to keep him there. He was able to get his arm
up, and slug Buffy in the face. She was unfazed, and connected with his
face next. Faith pulled him back, and kneed him in the gut.</p>
<p>He looked at the two slayers, and they
stared at him. His chances weren't looking too good. He looked over the
edge of the docks. "What the hell." He dove off, and plunged into the water.</p>
<p>They both ran to look, but they couldn't
see him.</p>
<p>"Let's get him." Faith said.</p>
<p>"He's not worth the effort. Next time he's
dead, though."</p>
<p>"Why'd you -?"</p>
<p>"He pissed me off." She took a deep breath.
"And got Riley captured."</p>
<p>Faith went wide-eyed. "And you're just
gonna let him slide?"</p>
<p>"As long as he stays away from me. Got
bigger things to worry about, anyway. Listen, I...heard some of -"</p>
<p>"Forget it, B. Never happened." The brown
haired slayer began to walk away. She had expected Buffy's reaction. She
debated and debated with herself, but she knew Buffy wouldn't want her
around after what happened.</p>
<p>"Wait." Buffy said, and Faith stopped.</p>
<p>She still wasn't sure of her feelings exactly,
and things had gotten too complicated too fast for her to really figure
anything out. But, she did know that she didn't want Faith out of her life.
Not for a second.</p>
<p>"Yes it did. And I liked it. But I'm...
there's circumstances, and I'm not very focused right now. I do know that
I need you right now. Slaying, my life..."</p>
<p>"What did you say?" Faith asked, turning
around with a look of disbelief on her face.</p>
<p>"I need you. And I want us to be, to coin
your phrase, five by five. I really do want to talk about this, but "</p>
<p>"We have a jailbreak to plan. Let's get
it done." Faith said, smiling.</p>
<p>Buffy Summers just said she needed her,
and right now, that was good enough.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Later, at Giles' house, Willow, Giles,
Faith and Buffy were looking at blueprints and maps of the Initiative complex.
They were laid out on the coffee table.</p>
<p>"These were the only files Riley gave to
me." Giles said.</p>
<p>"Least we can figure out the best place
to go in." Faith said.</p>
<p>"It has the alarm triggers marked too."
Buffy said.</p>
<p>"And Tara and I could whip up a spell or
two." Willow said.</p>
<p>"This is all great, but how are we supposed
to take on a group of marines that have access to guns and other warped
Jetson-like weaponry?"</p>
<p>The door opened then, and Xander and Anya
walked in. The four people looked up, specifically at Xander, with small
smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>"What? What'd we miss?" He asked.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Graham lowered the field so he could bring
Riley in some food. Riley sat, holding his knees, up against the far corner.
For a moment, he thought Graham had come to let him out. No such luck.
The soldier simply sat the tray down on the floor, backed out of the cell,
and punched in numbers on the wall keypad to bring up the field again.</p>
<p>"First unit's due back in two hours." Graham
said, and then disappeared from Riley's sight.</p>
<p>He went over to the tray. It had a turkey
and cheese sandwich and a Coke on it. At least it wasn't bread and water.
When he went to pick up the sandwich, he moved the plate a little. He noticed
there was something underneath.</p>
<p>It was a Swiss Army Knife. That happened
to have a pretty sharp knife and a screwdriver.</p>
<p>He went over to the wall of the cell that
held the wiring for the keypad outside. His brain started to work as he
realized what Graham had given him. If he could cut away the padding and
reach the panel, he could shut off the electrical field by severing the
wires, and then hopefully get and reach Buffy before she came down there.</p>
<p>He had two hours, so he pulled the knife
out and began cutting away the thick padding, and got to work.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>They sent Xander off to the army base,
Tara had come over with a very old looking spell-book which she and Willow
were currently searching through, and Anya, finally having some time to
confront Faith, decided now was the time to make sure her territory had
been clearly marked. Territory, meaning Xander.</p>
<p>She walked over to where Faith and Buffy
were sorting through Giles' box of weaponry. Both slayers had a feeling
his collection would be a bit too dated to be effective against marines.
Before Anya could say anything, she saw Buffy pull out a couple bullet-
proof vests, and turn so she was looking in Giles' direction.</p>
<p>"Where'd you get these?" Buffy asked him.</p>
<p>"Ah..." Giles was slow to answer. "The
night your mother and -"</p>
<p>Buffy visibly shook, and held her hand
out. "Forget I asked."</p>
<p>Anya walked up to Faith. "You can't have
Xander."</p>
<p>"Got it. Does it count if -" Faith cut
herself off when she saw Buffy shaking her head quickly. Anya eyed the
dark-haired girl and eventually left them alone. "For someone who's getting
it regularly she sure is a tight ass. And I know the problem can't be satisfaction."</p>
<p>"Can we not go down that down that road?"
Buffy asked, a pleading edge to her voice.</p>
<p>"Yeah." She said softly.</p>
<p>Both of them were surprised how quickly
she agreed. But Faith's emotions were becoming clearer to her. It wasn't
just lust with Buffy. Xander was a fun relief, but not Buffy. It was more
than that with her. A lot more. She was sure of that now. She was still
a little scared of the whole 'love' thing, but she knew. Buffy knew how
she felt too, because she could see the shock on the older slayer's face.</p>
<p>"Faith..."</p>
<p>"So," Faith said grabbing a vest and getting
them out of the tense moment they were currently in, "if we don't get shot
in the face, these could be real useful."</p>
<p>"We won't be."</p>
<p>"If we pull this off, they'll be too busy
to shoot at you." Willow called in their direction.</p>
<p>They went over to see what the two witches
had in mind.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"You need help getting the vest on there,
Buff?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>He had come back with two M-16's, seven
clips, ten grenades, and a few flashbangs. It was getting harder and harder
to come up with excuses to take the weapons, and if he had taken anymore,
well...it wouldn't have been pretty. While he was teaching the two slayers
how to use the equipment, Willow and Tara were setting up for their spell.</p>
<p>"No." Buffy and Anya said at the same time.
The ex-demon stormed out of the house. "You're gonna go after her, right?"</p>
<p>He took a deep breath. "Guess I have to,
huh?"</p>
<p>"How come you sound upset over that? You're
gettin' boinked daily, aren't you?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>"You'd think that'd be enough, but boinking,
much to my surprise, isn't enough. I wish there was more to us than that,
but I don't think there is."</p>
<p>Faith was a little surprised. She thought
guys were only interested in getting some. That's where she got most of
her philosophies. The guys wanted quickies, so she learned to just get
quickies and go. It was easier for all involved. But now that she was starting
to change her thoughts on the matter, Xander's admission rocked her foundations
just a little more.</p>
<p>"Maybe you should tell her that." Buffy
said softly.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I...should..."</p>
<p>"Go. We've got it covered." Faith said.</p>
<p>Buffy smiled at Faith, thanking her for
encouraging him. As he walked out, she went over to Willow and Tara.</p>
<p>"Everything five by - I mean...set?"
Buffy said, stumbling over her words. She couldn't believe she said that.</p>
<p>"Mi lingo es su lingo, B." Faith said,
a smile in her voice, while she was trying to get a feel for the sight
on the M-16.</p>
<p>"Yeah, we're good." Willow assured her.</p>
<p>"It'll take us about forty five minutes
to get through it. It's a pretty heavy conjuring spell." Tara said.</p>
<p>"But you'll have control, right?" Buffy
asked.</p>
<p>"Hey, we're the two baddest Wiccans this
side of the Mouth. We can handle anything." Willow said, looking at Buffy.</p>
<p>Buffy's gaze shifted to Tara, who had the
biggest smile she had ever seen. As soon as Willow looked over, Tara looked
down at her lap. Buffy couldn't stand it. She looked at Tara and moved
her finger in a 'come here' motion.</p>
<p>Tara stood up nervously, and Buffy led
her back to where Faith was.</p>
<p>"You better say something to her soon,
or I will." Tara looked down again, and Buffy lifted her chin up. "Hey,
it's cool. I think it's great. Or it will be once you tell her."</p>
<p>"She's practically smitten with you, Tar'."
Faith added. "It usually makes me violently ill, but not in this case.
What the hell does smitten mean anyway?"</p>
<p>"You think?" Tara asked.</p>
<p>"We know." The slayers said.</p>
<p>"So do I." Tara said, a small grin on her
face as she looked at them knowingly. She went back over to Willow, leaving
them speechless.</p>
<p>"Feel like kicking some military ass?"
Buffy asked eventually. 'Riley, Riley, Riley...'</p>
<p>"Thought you'd never ask." 'Taken...don't deserve her...be happy with her friendship...'</p>
<p>As they walked out of the house, they heard
calls of good luck.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Riley was now at the point where one screw
up could ruin everything. Which wire to cut? Red, Blue, Yellow, or Green?
Circuitry wasn't his specialty. He had to pick the right one, though, or
else the alarm system would go off, and every marine would swarm the place
in minutes. And Graham was "ignoring" everything he was doing, so the other
marine wouldn't further implicate himself.</p>
<p>Red meant stop. So it had to be the red.
Or maybe the green. Cause that meant go out. That's where he wanted to
go, right?
 Out? Maybe it was..."Just do it." He
commanded himself.</p>
<p>He reached forward with the knife, and
cut the red wire...</p>
<p>And the alarm sounded.</p>
<p>"Which one was it?" Riley asked as Graham
came over.</p>
<p>"Red and blue. Sorry...sir."</p>
<p>Two wires? The only thing he could think
was of how unfair it was.</p>
<p>"It's all right soldier. You were just
doing your job."</p>
<p>All he could do now, was wait. It would
all be over soon</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>As soon as Buffy and Faith slid down the
cable in the elevator shaft, they heard the alarms sound. They had all
their gear either around their shoulders, or stuck in pouches on their
waists. Faith opened the hatch on the top of the elevator, and looked down
into its white-walled, somewhat claustrophobic space.</p>
<p>"You ready for this? Will and Tara should
be halfway through it by now." Buffy said.</p>
<p>"After you, girlfriend." Faith had this
confident, somewhat cocky look on her face that Buffy drew strength from.</p>
<p>Buffy's thoughts got strangely focused
right before she went into slaying mode. All those extra thoughts kind
of took a backseat, and she would just become an instinctive machine. Looking
at Faith now, actually seeing, without all those other distracting thoughts,
allowed her to finally see the truth.</p>
<p>She did love her. She had for a really
long time. It had started as soon as Faith come to town she realized. But
not at the time. Faith was unlike anyone she had ever met, and she was
drawn to it. The other slayer had kept her on her toes, connected with
her, excited her, in a way no one else had. Of the three people she had
opened her heart too, again discounting Parker and Scott, she was glad
she had. They were all special.</p>
<p>Angel had been a beautiful, passionate
experience, and even through all the pain she was glad she had gone through
it. Allowed to love him like she had. She didn't think any relationship
she had would ever be the same as that. But they were over now, and that
was for the best.</p>
<p>Riley was nice and stable, and she loved
him, and would get him safe, but even though he had been involved in an
underground organization that kinda fought demons, he was still...normal.
And that was great, it was a nice change from the cloud of darkness that
had surrounded her and Angel for longest time. But there were just things
he would never understand, things he had to know if they could hope of
surviving. Their relationship had started out based on untruths about who
they were, and that was never a good way to begin. They were too different.</p>
<p>Faith? She had lied, sure. So had Buffy.
But they weren't involved then. They had been cautious. It wasn't just
Faith who tested her limits; Buffy had been testing too. Now all that was
over, the walls were crumbling, and they knew each other. They were friends.
And she had wanted that for so long. Now she wanted to see what the next
level would bring, as apparently, did Faith.</p>
<p>If Buffy wanted to know something, no matter
what it was, Faith would tell her flat out. Nothing was toned down, and
she knew Faith just by looking into her eyes. Buffy was the same way. If
you looked hard enough, they were both open books. And Buffy wanted to
read.</p>
<p>She didn't know how far they would go,
what would happen...but she did know they both had a lot more in common
then one would think. Sure their childhood's had been pretty different,
but they both weren't perfect. Buffy knew that just one thing out of place,
and she could have had Faith's life; and Faith hers. They both were cautious
about whom they let in and shut out, and had a connection only they understood.</p>
<p>They made a pretty damn good team too.
Buffy had been searching too deeply for a reason she liked Faith's kiss.
A bond between them might have helped to reveal her feelings and brought
them closer, but she liked the kiss because she loved Faith. It was a simple
answer, however complicated. There were still doubts in her mind as to
what a "relationship" with Faith would be like. But she could see Faith's
eyes. They were scared too, but there was also love in them.</p>
<p>She realized that this dawning had come
at a really bad time, but she was glad it did. Because it would've unfair
to both Riley and Faith if she had tortured herself over it for months.
She would feel guilty with him, and awkward with her.</p>
<p>Angel had been detrimental to her too.
If she hadn't been so caught up in him last year, allowed herself to open
her eyes and realize the dead end they had been headed towards sooner,
she wouldn't have had to watch Faith or herself do those things to...but
the past was the past.</p>
<p>She felt good now, and would feel even
better once Riley was safe and this was over.</p>
<p>"B? You okay?"</p>
<p>"Huh? Oh. Yeah."</p>
<p>Buffy dropped down into the elevator, Faith
soon behind her.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Just as Riley had expected, every soldier
was standing in front of his cage within five minutes. Forrest approached
Graham, and asked him what had happened. Riley watched as Graham simply
said that he must have hidden the knife, and they just didn't pick it up
when they patted him down.</p>
<p>After Forrest was finished, he turned to
Riley looking angry and somewhat disappointed. Then he spoke into the to
the small intercom on the opposite wall.</p>
<p>"Gas. Cell Seven."</p>
<p>Inside the cell, the hidden vents on the
ceiling revealed themselves. The gas was tinted yellow, and Riley tried
to prepare himself by holding his shirt over his mouth, but he was just
delaying the inevitable. That's when they all heard the shots.</p>
<p>Before they could react, they were hit
by the disorienting and nauseating effect of a flash bang grenade. More
shots rang out, and the crackle of electrical sparks echoed off the walls.
Hacking and wheezing from the gas, Riley noticed that the electrical field
was down. He stumbled out, and was caught by two strong hands.</p>
<p>After a few more seconds, everything was
clear and silent once again. Most of the Initiative was trying to figure
out what the hell was going on, and then they saw. Supporting Riley a few
feet away was Buffy, M-16 being held in her free hand; and Faith holding
one as well. The marines quickly took their weapons into their hands.</p>
<p>"Gotta love a stand-off." Faith said, fire
in her eyes.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Back in Giles' house, Tara and Willow sat
in a circle on a cleared off spot on the floor, pink and blue powders surrounding
them. At the center, their hands met, and they chanted as a mist swirled
around them. They were both near physical exhaustion, their bodies shaking
lightly.</p>
<p>Giles watched with extreme fascination
as they said the final line of the spell.</p>
<p>"Let it be! Let him be the protector! Let
it be!"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"I love having the advantage even more."
Faith added.</p>
<p>The complex shook, and almost out of nothingness
appeared a hulking form. The creature was massive, his blue-pinkish skin
ripping with supernatural muscles. Near the bottom of his stomach, a small,
yellow crystal pulsated, clawed hands balled into fists, and horns protruded
from the side of his mouth.</p>
<p>First he looked back at Buffy and Faith,
and they pointed to the group of commandos in front of him. He nodded,
faced them, growled, then attacked. Faith joined him. Buffy helped Riley
back against a wall, and told him to stay put.</p>
<p>The men were getting thrown every which
way, their bullets having no effect on it. Faith turned her gun around,
hit Graham in the head with it, and tossed him in the cell. Buffy ran up
to Forrest who was trying to aim his gun at the conjured creature. She
got behind him, and put him in a chokehold.</p>
<p>"Call them off, we walk out."</p>
<p>"Not an option." Forrest said.</p>
<p>"Don't say I didn't warn you."</p>
<p>She let go and pushed him in front of her,
and then kicked him in the chest. He dropped to his hands and knees, and
his gun clattered to the floor. Buffy went to join Faith, who wasn't even
breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>"Ready to go?" Buffy asked while backhanding
someone to the ground.</p>
<p>Faith shook her head. "They'll just keep
coming. This is a war to them. Let's give 'em one."</p>
<p>"No guns unless absolutely necessary."</p>
<p>The two slayers fell in sync, and along
with the creature, continued to thoroughly beat anything that crossed their
path.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Riley, his eyes a tad blurry, watched the
fight from his semi-safe position. As his vision cleared, he found Buffy
in the crowd. Then he scanned the rest of the battle and saw Jackson aiming
his gun in Buffy's direction. He shouted to her, and she looked in his
direction, but by then the bullet was on its way, and she dropped to the
ground.</p>
<p>He scrambled to his feet, panic and anger
rushing through him, and noticed that Forrest was struggling to get up
and reach his gun that sat a few feet away. Their eyes met and they knew
what the other was thinking. They both got bursts of energy and lunged
for the weapon.</p>
<p>Both of their hands latched onto the barrel,
and they were struggling on the ground to get the upper hand. Riley used
all his strength and drove the gun forward making it hit Forrest's cheek
and cut it open. Forrest retaliated by bashing Riley's face with his elbow,
and Riley lost his grip.</p>
<p>He got to his feet, gun in hand. Riley
got up then too, and tried to kick out his ex-friend's legs. Forrest anticipated
this, and got close enough so Riley couldn't use his legs.</p>
<p>"I told you, Riley. Should have listened."</p>
<p>He pushed the gun barrel into Riley's chest,
driving him back, and shot him with extreme precision in the heart. Riley's
eyes went wide, he dropped to his knees, and then finally all the way to
the ground. He was gone, and his blood pooled underneath
 him.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>The bullet had simply lodged in Buffy's
vest, but it still took the wind out of her. She pushed herself onto all
fours after a few seconds. Faith was about to help her the rest of the
way when they both heard two shots. Buffy stood immediately.</p>
<p>One shot had come from a commando who hit
the yellow jewel on the creature's stomach. The creature slowly faded away.
The other shot was harder to place. Faith saw who had done it first.</p>
<p>"B! Over there!"</p>
<p>Buffy looked and saw Forrest, who appeared
to be looking down at something. She looked to where she had left Riley
then, and he wasn't there anymore. She fought her way over, Faith following.</p>
<p>'No. It's not what you think...it's
not...'</p>
<p>Then she saw his body, and went completely
numb. Faith wasn't though. She saw too, and quickly weighed her options.
Forrest was a threat to her, Buffy, and had just killed Riley. It wasn't
murder. It was war. So, she did what you're supposed to do in a war. Take
down the enemy. Guns were definitely necessary now. She raised her M-16,
and shot Forrest in the back. The man lurched forward, and fell.</p>
<p>Everyone stopped then. Buffy finally walked
forward, and crouched by Riley's body. Faith turned to the rest of the
team, and pulled a grenade off her waist.</p>
<p>"We could've just taken him and split.
But no. One last chance. How do you want this to end?" She held the grenade
out for them all to see.</p>
<p>They still had their guns aimed at her
when Graham emerged from the cell, holding his head in pain. He looked
around at what had happened. He was in command now.</p>
<p>"It's over. Back off." He told his men.
"Now."</p>
<p>They lowered their weapons. Faith looked
at Graham, and then tossed him the grenade. He caught it shakily.</p>
<p>"We're gone." She knelt down by Buffy and
shook her shoulder. "Come on, B. Gotta go." She said softly.</p>
<p>Buffy gave her a look that broke her heart.
She eventually stood, and taking one last look at Riley, she walked out
with Faith, leaning on her for support.</p>
<p>When the two of them left, Graham walked
up to the bodies of Riley and Forrest.</p>
<p>"Incinerate him." He pointed to Forrest.
"He never existed."</p>
<p>"What about -" One of them started to ask.</p>
<p>Graham looked at Riley. "They say he's
been ready. Hurry."</p>
<p>Two men grabbed Riley's arms, and dragged
him towards a room. A room with the numbers '314' on the door.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Spike came to in the woods. He tried to
remember what happened, and figured he must have hit something that knocked
him out when he hit the water. But...how did he get here? That's when
he saw a man's shadow looming over him. He looked skyward, and suddenly
froze.</p>
<p>"What do you fear?" Adam asked him.</p>

</table>

<p>It had been three days since the whole
confrontation with the Initiative. Since Riley's death, since her run in
with Spike, and
 Buffy was still closed off. To everyone.
She stayed holed up in her dorm room, not moving an inch. Didn't go to
classes,
 anything. The only one who saw her was
Willow. She was allowed admittance, well, because she lived there. But
Buffy wasn't
 really talking to her about anything either.</p>
<p>Faith had been happy to pick up the slaying.
Willow, Tara, and Xander had even come with her. She was still amazed that
she
 could call them her friends. But the solo
slaying, group behind her or not, was growing tired. She was only half
of the Chosen
 Two, and she wanted Buffy out there with
her. She couldn't do it by herself. She knew people dealt with loss in
different ways,
 but three days with minimal human contact
wasn't healthy.</p>
<p>It hadn't helped her; that was for sure.
The Mayor had been *too* human, and couldn't really be considered actual
human
 contact. Point was, he had driven her
to do some very, very bad things.</p>
<p>And she didn't want to see that happen
to Buffy. A purely selfish part of her wondered, if she died, would Buffy
take her death
 this hard? She had thought Angel was the
only one who Buffy had taken the time to brood over, but if all the people
she loved
 got this treatment…well that was rather
assuming of her. She didn't know if Buffy did or not. But she had hope.</p>
<p>Riley had been a good guy. It had stung
her that she hadn't been able to do her job and get him out of there. That's
what made
 saving lives a lot harder than taking
them. It was a lot more work. Physically and emotionally. But it was rewarding
work if you
 didn't screw up. It wasn't like she had
pushed aside his death. Far from it.</p>
<p>She had screwed up. If they had just left
when Buffy wanted to, Riley would have been alive now. Then again, by staying,
they
 had really hurt the Initiative, and Faith
had a feeling the group wouldn't try anything for awhile. At least not
to them directly. So
 she was into self-preservation. Was that
really a bad thing?</p>
<p>But the fact was that Buffy was hurting
over it. And that meant Faith did too. Not in the same way, but still hurting.
But she had
 to look positive. If they had died down
there, or shortly thereafter, there would be no one to save the world.
She had tried
 telling Buffy that after Allan's death,
but she had gotten a bit too carried away. Her simple point was that there
was a whole five
 billion people that still needed them,
and right now Buffy was putting them at risk by not slaying.</p>
<p>She wasn't a monster, she grieved, but
she didn't let it consume her. And it was time to help Buffy get back on
track. She went
 up to the second floor of Stevenson Hall,
and saw Willow coming down the hall. They met each other half way.</p>
<p>"You gonna give it a shot?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"No change?"</p>
<p>Willow shook her head. "I just came to
give her homework. I have a couple more classes. I don't know what to do.
After you
 two came back that night we did the usual,
and I thought she'd be fine."</p>
<p>"Usual?"</p>
<p>"Crying after a traumatic event. Sounds
really bad saying it that way, but over four years we've all got an unwritten
rule. Cry,
 one day of 'me' time, and at least attempt
to do the life thing. Even when…with Oz…"</p>
<p>Wow. Willow was opening up to her. "You
don't have…I get it."</p>
<p>She smiled saying she wanted to continue.
"I'm just saying that even though I felt…not so good…I still did stuff.
But she's
 breaking the rule. Even when Angel became
Mr. Bad Guy, she wasn't like this. It's weird."</p>
<p>"I'll get her back."</p>
<p>"You think she will?"</p>
<p>"She won't have a choice."</p>
<p>Willow had to smile when she heard the
forcefulness in Faith's voice. She put her hand on the slayer's arm. "Thanks."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy showed barely any reaction when she
heard the voice call to her on the other side of the door.</p>
<p>"B, I'm coming in."</p>
<p>The doorknob turned, and she watched Faith
enter from her position on the bed. The dark-haired slayer closed the door
 behind her, locked it, and came to sit
against the side of the bed.</p>
<p>"Taking shifts now?" Buffy asked. She couldn't
tell whether her voice was angry or not.</p>
<p>"Below the belt, Chica. We just care about
ya."</p>
<p>"I know." Buffy sighed. "So how long are
you planning to be in here?"</p>
<p>"Long as you."</p>
<p>"Then get comfy, cause I don't really wanna
leave anytime soon."</p>
<p>"If you insist." Faith climbed up onto
the bed, and laid down beside her.</p>
<p>"Hey!"</p>
<p>"You said comfy. Choose your words more
carefully next time." Buffy moved to get up, but Faith pulled her back
down.
 "That's a no no. Cause then I'd follow
you."</p>
<p>"But then you won't be comfy anymore."</p>
<p>"Says who?" That was a little off-topic,
but it did make Buffy's eyebrows raise slightly. It was a start. "I'll
never get tired of you,
 B. You're too much fun to be around."</p>
<p>"Was that sarcasm?"</p>
<p>Faith grinned. "You're a quick one. But
under normal circumstances you're loads of fun."</p>
<p>"And what exactly is 'normal circumstances'?"</p>
<p>"Anything that doesn't involve sitting
here stone-faced and catatonic."</p>
<p>"That was harsh."</p>
<p>"Yeah, maybe. But Red already tried the
comfort angle. Didn't work. So I'm giving it to you straight up. Start
talking and I
 might be nice."</p>
<p>"That's supposed to be an incentive?" Faith
cringed just the tiniest bit, but Buffy caught it. "Damn. I'm sorry. I
didn't mean…"</p>
<p>"I know you didn't, but we have a choice
here. We could throw daggers at one another," Buffy flinched now, "though
not in the
 literal sense. And even though I can,
I really don't want to, cause it doesn't get us anywhere."</p>
<p>"What's the other choice?"</p>
<p>"Talk to me. I know I'm probably the last
person you want to…hey, you think if I get you drunk again you'd spill
the beans?"</p>
<p>Buffy smirked a little. "Getting a tad
suggestive, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"If we do that again, I want to be nice
and sober for it. But you're just playin' on my weaknesses, B, and I don't
like it."</p>
<p>The blonde went stoic again. "Talk or not
talk, huh?"</p>
<p>"That is the question. And it's your call."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Tara paced outside the classroom Willow
was currently occupying. She was going to come out and tell her. She was…she
 was…she was. But maybe it was a bad idea.
Willow had been in love with a guy before. Really in love. Whereas she
had never
 been in love with anybody. This was a
big thing. Something that shouldn't be taken lightly.</p>
<p>She peaked in at Willow sitting in the
first row. Then again, if Willow felt the same way, it could turn out to
be really great. But
 what if she didn't? Then the friendship
Tara had formed with her would be destroyed. The consequences of rejection
were too
 great. Why risk an already good thing?</p>
<p>To make it even better, she told herself.
She grabbed her head in frustration. A half an hour. A half an hour until
the class was
 out. Then it would be decision time. Finally.
One way or the other.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"Ice cream. Mini-fridge." Buffy said pointing.</p>
<p>Faith got up off the bed, did as ordered,
but was puzzled. "What's ice cream have to do with anything?"</p>
<p>"It's the non-alcoholic way to drown your
sorrows. It's the only way I'm speaking." Faith brought back a pint of
cookie dough
 ice cream, and resumed her previous position
on the bed. Buffy opened it, and pulled out two spoons from her beside
bureau.
 "Better."</p>
<p>"So…what's going on with you? Three days
is a long time."</p>
<p>Buffy ate some. "Been thinking, I guess."</p>
<p>"About him?"</p>
<p>"That was the first day."</p>
<p>"If he was the first day, why'd you break
the rule?"</p>
<p>"Will told you, huh?" Buffy smiled. "I've
been thinking about my love life. And about how I screw up anyone who dares
to love
 me."</p>
<p>"That isn't true."</p>
<p>"Oh really? I turn Angel evil and send
him to Hell, I scared Scott off and probably scarred him for life, I got
Riley
 killed…and…"</p>
<p>"First, there's nothing wrong with you.
They chose to take the risks. It's your fault because you -?"</p>
<p>"Because I loved them, yeah. I didn't know
what I was doing with Angel. I had never felt that way before. It was all
so new,
 and I…he became my world. I rushed things
because I couldn't handle my own emotions. Angel didn't know about the
curse."</p>
<p>"You didn't either."</p>
<p>"But I should have made sure there were
no risks."</p>
<p>"You think there's a 'How to Guide' on
sleeping with souled vamps? There isn't, B. You can look back and say this
now, but
 there's nothing you could've done."</p>
<p>"Okay then. Scott. Normal guy. I didn't
tell him the risks. He really liked me too. I guess I really didn't "love
him" love him, but I
 was trying so hard to get over Angel,
that I rushed to try and date him when…"</p>
<p>"The A guy came back. Out of your control,
B."</p>
<p>"But then I led him on. And that wasn't
right."</p>
<p>"Why do you do this to yourself?" Faith
took a deep breath. "You only got one left. I'm interested to see how you
find yourself
 in the wrong on this one."</p>
<p>"Actually, I have two left." Faith was
confused. "You wanna know how it's my fault? Cause if I had never…he wouldn't
have
 gotten those ideas about breaking away…and
he'd…still be alive."</p>
<p>"You gotta do better than that."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Buffy," Buffy figured she must really
be serious if her whole name was spoken, "the guy was involved in an underground
GI Joe
 operation that experimented on demons.
Either way you paint it, the guy was in for a serious hurt eventually."</p>
<p>"So you're saying I did him a favor by
helping what was inevitable anyway?" Buffy asked, her voice angry.</p>
<p>"No! I'm saying you didn't do anything.
That's the point. I'm not the cold bitch you might think of am, you know.
I'm sad about
 him dying too."</p>
<p>"I don't think you're cold. Or a bitch."
Buffy said softly.</p>
<p>"Look, all I'm saying is, he chose that
life. He had to accept certain possibilities. Death at an early age being
at the top of the
 list. You didn't choose to kill demons,
he did. Big diff."</p>
<p>"Well then fate seems to be against me,
because apparently I'm not allowed to love anybody. And whoever's fault
it is, Angel,
 Scott, Riley, and you, didn't deserve
it."</p>
<p>"No. They didn't." Did Buffy just say -?
"Me?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>As Willow came out of the classroom, Tara
decided she would talk to her. If the conversation got to *that* point,
then she
 would tell. She followed behind Willow,
and eventually tapped her on the shoulder. The redhead whirled around.</p>
<p>"Oh! Tara. You scared me."</p>
<p>"Sorry." Tara said, nervousness in her
voice.</p>
<p>"What's up?"</p>
<p>"I…can we talk?"</p>
<p>Willow couldn't figure out why Tara was
so, shier, than usual. "Your place?"</p>
<p>"Could we walk? I just…we could get distracted
there…by spell stuff…and…"</p>
<p>Willow squeezed Tara's hand. "That sounds
nice."</p>
<p>They started to head out of the building.
"So…how's Buffy?"</p>
<p>"The same. Faith's in with her now."</p>
<p>"You think it's working?"</p>
<p>"I hope so."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"Yes, you. Now's a good a time as any.
I love you, Faith. Now you can get a head start and run away from me before
your
 second chance is ruined."</p>
<p>"Hang on. Let me get this straight. You
love me?"</p>
<p>"Don't act so surprised. But now we've
got ourselves a situation."</p>
<p>"Do we?" Faith had a concerned look. It
took all of her energy to not continue with the way the conversation had
been going.
 "No…wait a sec. Explain to me why I should
run away. I tried that already, and it led to trouble."</p>
<p>"And I caused it. I pushed you away over
and over…and -"</p>
<p>Faith shot off the bed. Her face clearly
showed anger as she turned to face Buffy. "We did this already! It was
my fault!"</p>
<p>"It was my fault. I loved you all the way
back then. Didn't really know, though, cause I was 'with' Angel. So when
I first met
 you, instead of dealing and trying to
be friends with you, I decided to just brush you off. After that, and when
we started slaying
 regularly and stuff, cause I didn't have
a choice, I thought maybe we could be friends. But then I started feeling
guilty when I
 was with you, and I didn't know why.</p>
<p>"I started driving you away again after
Christmas. And only then, when you went to the Mayor, did I realize what
I lost. I
 wanted you back, but before I could really
get a grip on what I felt for you, you turned completely to the dark side,
and my
 feelings got buried cause I had to fight
you.</p>
<p>"And when I stuck the knife…in my mind,
I killed you in a way. Just like everyone else. We were given a chance
to start over
 now. I don't know why, but I want to do
it right. Friendship is good. We've built a nice thing here. Haven't we?"</p>
<p>"You tell me you…nobody has ever said that
to me, and now you're telling me I can't?"</p>
<p>"You deserved to know. Do you love me?"
Faith looked away. "Ha! You're afraid to say it because of what might happen.
 Well now you know how I feel."</p>
<p>"I love you." Faith said almost inaudible.</p>
<p>"What did you say?"</p>
<p>Faith turned around. "I love you, okay?
Now we're both out in the open. And you're right. I'm scared as hell. Cause
I don't
 want to mess up. We both know my rep.
But I'll be real selfish right now. I've never needed much before. Always
scrounged
 up enough to get by. But, and it's hard
to admit this, I need you. Everything. And if you feel the same way, there's
no damn way
 I'm going to let my 'what ifs' ruin what
could be really good."</p>
<p>"That isn't enough."</p>
<p>"Not enough? Here. I promise that if I
die, I won't blame you. Okay?"</p>
<p>"Not funny, Faith."</p>
<p>"Wasn't meant to be. You've gotta learn
to let go."</p>
<p>"It's hard."</p>
<p>"You're too hard on yourself. I'd be cool
with it if you needed time to deal with Riley, but if you're holding back
because you're
 afraid you'll screw me up, don't worry.
I'm already at the lowest rung of the ladder, B. Only place to go is up.</p>
<p>"I know the risks. We're in the same biz.
And I'll say this one last
time, and then this will never be mentioned
again. I didn't think
 before I acted, I jumped to conclusions,
and I screwed up. It was not your fault. I handled things badly, my mistakes,
not
 yours. Say, 'Okay, Faith.'"</p>
<p>"Okay…"</p>
<p>"More?"</p>
<p>"Faith. Okay, Faith." Buffy smiled.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Willow and Tara walked around on the lawn
outside campus not going anywhere in particular. They were in mid-conversation,
 and had been talking about little things
for the past fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>"So I got a paper for -" Willow started.</p>
<p>'Just say it. Even if she says no, I'm
sure she'll be cool about it. She's always cool about stuff.'</p>
<p>"I love you."</p>
<p>Willow turned and smiled at her. "I love
you too."</p>
<p>"No…not just…like that."</p>
<p>They stopped.</p>
<p>"Well, what other way could you mean…oh."
She looked at Tara for another second, and promptly fainted.</p>
<p>Tara caught her before she hit the ground.
Not exactly the reaction she was expecting.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"Did it ever occur to that college girl
brain of yours that the reason we were given a second chance is to do everything
right
 again? Not just the friendship part?"</p>
<p>"It crossed my mind."</p>
<p>"You want to know why I respect you so
much? Not cause you're a kick ass slayer, or because you have things I
don't, but
 because you're real careful about opening
up your heart to people. When you decide to love someone, you go all the
way. And
 I'm not talking about screwing. You give
everything. You risk everything. You care so much, and aren't afraid to
take on other
 people's baggage."</p>
<p>"But I shouldn't. I mean, look where it's
gotten me. I take they're baggage, sure. Then I try to help, and it all
goes wrong. I don't
 know that the hell I'm doing."</p>
<p>"Guess what? Nobody does. It's called living
life, B. Something I haven't done for a real long time. Cause I was afraid
of getting
 hurt…and…sometimes you get a win, sometimes
you get a loss. But when you get a loss, you keep going. You heal up, and
try
 again. You don't give up."</p>
<p>"Cause giving up is bad. Wrong even. Right?"</p>
<p>"It's not a good way to go. Believe me.
I never enjoyed doing those jobs for the Mayor. Not really. I had to act
like I did so he
 wouldn't kill me. I got a little into
it sometimes, and I felt myself slipping away every time. You definitely
don't want to ever give
 up."</p>
<p>"What should we do?"</p>
<p>"I think I'm a little biased there, B."</p>
<p>Buffy grinned a little. "I trust you, you
know that right?"</p>
<p>"I do now."</p>
<p>"Well I do. And I…it's just that…after
my previous attempts…"</p>
<p>"Hey it's understandable. Um…Scott."</p>
<p>"What about him?</p>
<p>"He never really took off right?"</p>
<p>"Never got a chance to, really. But I still…"</p>
<p>Faith sat on the bed quickly, and put a
finger to Buffy's lips. "No more of that." "Why'd you ask me about Scott?"</p>
<p>"Come on, you know what they say. Third
time's a charm. If you're willing to give it a shot. If you're ready."</p>
<p>"Riley's gone. I loved him, and that won't
change. But me sitting here any longer isn't going to bring him back, or
help anything
 for that matter. I developed Angel's brooding
habit, and it's time I shook it off."</p>
<p>"That means?"</p>
<p>"It means, I love you."</p>
<p>"And that means?"</p>
<p>"I want to give us a shot. If you're willing
to trust me."</p>
<p>"That's all I have to do? Yes, I trust
you. And here I thought there was a test."</p>
<p>Buffy swatted her. "Smartass. This was
a test. For both of us."</p>
<p>"Think we passed?"</p>
<p>"God, I hope so."</p>
<p>She leaned forward and kissed Faith. It
wasn't like anything Faith had felt before. It was so full of…oh. So this
was what love
 was. It wasn't like the kiss she had initiated
that night. This was Buffy's way. It was meant to convey feelings. And
it was
 amazing. So amazing, that they both didn't
hear the door bust open, and the handle bust.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>They stopped reluctantly, and turned around
to see Tara carrying Willow in her arms.</p>
<p>"Sorry. It was locked and…I didn't know
I could kick that hard…"</p>
<p>"Forget the door, what happened?" Buffy
asked.</p>
<p>"I kinda took your advice…and told her…and…"</p>
<p>Faith started laughing. She could just
picture it.</p>
<p>"Faith!" Buffy said. "Put her on her bed
Tara. I'll get some water."</p>
<p>Buffy walked out into the hall and towards
the bathroom.</p>
<p>"Sorry. It's just, only she would just
flat out faint like that." Faith finally said.</p>
<p>"Do you think she -?"</p>
<p>"She's loves you. Trust me."</p>
<p>"How do you know for sure?"</p>
<p>Faith thought a minute and smiled. "I just
do. That's what love is. You just…know."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"How's he doing?" Graham asked a doctor.</p>
<p>"The last transplant went off without any
problems. We won't make the same mistakes this time."</p>
<p>"I just hope you don't make new ones. We
can't afford that. He's too well prepared to lose."</p>
<p>Graham looked down at the sheet-covered
body on the table, and allowed himself a small smile. In the Initiative,
they looked
 out for their own. Even if it meant tweaking
a few things. Adam was a prototype. A promising, however, flawed prototype.
But
 this one would be different.</p>
<p>Riley had taught Graham everything he knew.
His mentor didn't deserve to die by a comrade's weapon. So Graham did the
 only thing he could to see that Riley
was taken care of. He was always the best, and it was only fair that he
be the next of them
 to achieve the status Professor Walsh
had wanted.</p>
<p>It was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>Tara sat on Willow's bed waiting for the
redhead to come back from the bathroom. Buffy and Faith had left once Willow
woke up, not saying anything to her about the change that had occurred
between them. Tara was grateful, because she and Willow needed to talk
about the change in their relationship first. And there was a change. You
couldn't just take back an 'I love you'. Not that she wanted to,
but given Willow's reaction, she wasn't feeling very confident.</p>
<p>Willow came in quietly after a minute,
and was looking everywhere, at everything, but Tara.</p>
<p>"You hate me." Tara said. It seemed obvious
enough to her.</p>
<p>"No, I don't! I just…process. I need to
process things. Processing is important."</p>
<p>There was silence again. It went on for
more minutes than Tara could stand, so she finally got off the bed, and
started to walk towards the busted door.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"I…I shouldn't have said anything. I'm
making you uncomfortable, so…I'll go."</p>
<p>Willow rushed to her. "I'm sorry. It's
good you told me. Being open with feelings is…you should do that. Honesty."</p>
<p>"So…"</p>
<p>"Um…so you're…uh…you know…"</p>
<p>"Oh…I guess…I never really liked anyone
like that before."</p>
<p>Willow couldn't help but be flattered,
but she was also sad for her friend.</p>
<p>"Never?"</p>
<p>"I didn't really date or anything."</p>
<p>"I'm not freaked if that's what you think.
I just wasn't expecting -"</p>
<p>"Kinda wasn't sure how to bring it up.
Are we…still friends?"</p>
<p>"Of course we are. I really like you, Tara.
I'm…just not sure how much yet. Buffy and Xander will tell you that I get
my feelings all jumbly, and then confusion sets in. But being friends?
Don't ever worry about that."</p>
<p>Tara was relieved. It wasn't a no, and
their friendship was still intact. Even though she worried, she knew deep
down Willow would be cool about it. It was out there now. Off her chest.
Willow knew how she felt, and now it was just a matter of letting her deal
in her own way. She could be patient. Now, how long, that was a different
story. She watched Willow's face shift into heavy thinking mode.</p>
<p>'Her face always scrunches and she does
this cute thing with her mouth…get back on track, Tara!'</p>
<p>"What is it, Willow?"</p>
<p>"I was just thinking about Buffy and Xander.
How they might…"</p>
<p>"React?"</p>
<p>"If we ever, you know."</p>
<p>"I don't know about Xander, but…"</p>
<p>"But what?"</p>
<p>"Nothing." She had to hide a smile.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>When they left the campus, the sun was
almost down, so they decided to head to Restfield to see if any vampires
decided to rise. Buffy was still a little unsure about things, but she
was happy. Her unsureness had nothing to do with Faith or her feelings
for her, but more along the lines of, 'Did we rush it?'</p>
<p>After the long talk they had in the dorm,
after she said she wanted to give them a shot, kissing just seemed…right.
She wanted to try and have a relationship with Faith; she wanted to kiss
her again, so she went with the flow. And that's where the flow led. But
she just hoped she had made the right choice to commit to something else
so soon.</p>
<p>Riley just died three days before. And
she had sat in solitary for the major of those seventy-two hours, re-evaluating
her life. Thinking through everything she had told Faith, and bits
and pieces of other things. She had a tendency to go into deep depressions
after…events like, what happened to Riley.</p>
<p>A depression was okay for 'normal' people,
but for her, as a slayer, she couldn't afford to keep doing it. There were
other lives to think about keeping alive. Most immediately, her friends.
One of these times, she would get them killed because she wouldn't be thinking
clearly. It had happened to Jenny. And Faith was right. She had to let
go. Not completely, because she still cared, deeply, but enough so that
it didn't eat away at her.</p>
<p>Getting more specific, her love life had
been filled with large gaps because she took so long to deal, and was afraid
to risk doing it all over again. But that left her miserable. Most of the
time she tried to put other people before herself, because one, it was
her job, and two, it was who she was. Then she would look at all the people
who were happy, and she'd want to be happy too.</p>
<p>She loved her friends, she loved her mother,
Giles, but it wasn't the same. And with everyone having conflicting life
directions, and only really being able to see them when a crisis popped
up, she felt a little emptier inside than she had in the past. They still
made her happy when she saw them, but there were different levels of happiness.</p>
<p>Riley had given her happiness of the love
kind, and it had been wonderful. They were only really 'together' a little
over three months, but those months had been really nice. Something she
had never truly experienced before. Sure there were risks, but not like
Angel. It wasn't the same intensity that she had with Angel, but that didn't
matter. Riley was a human, corn fed, all around nice, Iowa guy. She'd miss
him, and she'd think about him, but he was gone. And Faith was here. What
she felt for him didn't change because she loved her too.</p>
<p>Normally, she would wait the better part
of a year to go looking for happiness and love again, and even then she
didn't really look. Love usually found her whether she liked it or not.
Well she had decided not to fight it this time. She was going to be selfish,
because love was right in front of her and so was happiness, well beside
her actually, and she wouldn't wait anymore.</p>
<p>The more she thought about it now, the
more she certain she felt that she had made the right choice. Her feelings
for Faith had been building for a long time, and this was the natural step
to take. A step, not a rushed sprint. And it also seemed natural for her
to get behind Faith and pull her into an embrace.</p>
<p>"What's this for?" Faith asked, amused
and content at the same time.</p>
<p>"Just felt like it. Are you not a hugger?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what I am. You have more
experience in this area than me. The meaningful stuff. But I don't mind
this."</p>
<p>"We'll figure this out as we go along.
There's no guidebook to a relationship. Just gotta take things as they
come."</p>
<p>"Like tellin' the Scoobs?"</p>
<p>"Good place to start." And then it sank
in. "Oh."</p>
<p>"Not only have you started lip-locking
with a chick, but you're also lip-locking with a skanky, seducing chick
that had evil vibes at one point. You're sure about this...right?"</p>
<p>"Yes. We'll just take it slow. The gang
can cope, and we'll be careful. Hopefully Will'll take it okay, seeing
as how her and Tara…wait. Seducing? Somebody's got an ego."</p>
<p>"And you love it."</p>
<p>"Do I deny? You're not a skank either."</p>
<p>"Hey, I never said I was a skank. I said
I was skank-y." Buffy became quiet, and let go of the dark-haired slayer.
"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Do you hear that?" Faith listened. It
sounded like a low growl. It was coming from above them. "Can you support
me?"</p>
<p>Faith's mind came up with several different
answers to that question, but decided on, "Huh?"</p>
<p>"On your shoulders?" Buffy's look said,
'Sssh, and trust me' so Faith did. She bent over, and Buffy's carefully
climbed up onto her shoulders. They stood underneath a tree. "Be ready."</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>Buffy grabbed onto the end of a thick branch,
and in an amazing feat of gymnastic ability, swung around the branch in
a full circle, keeping her legs straight, and knocked something out of
the tree, which crashed to the ground. By the looks of it, it was very
demonic, and very angry.</p>
<p>Faith went wide-eyed. "Oh. Be ready for
THAT."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>In the Bronze, Xander held Anya close as
they danced on the floor. He had been able once again to convince her that
his sexual innuendo directed at Buffy, in reference to her bulletproof
vest, Anya made him explain himself fully, was harmless. He always joked
with Buffy, and had come to terms with not having her in a girlfriend way.
But he was the guy friend, and it was his duty to make jokingly suggestive
remarks.</p>
<p>That seemed to settle her, but the tension
between them as they were dancing now, was stifling. The fact that their
relationship was based wholly on sex, he couldn't stop fooling himself,
really, really, bothered him. He got nothing redeeming out of it. Five
seconds of pleasure maybe, and yet he still did everything she asked.</p>
<p>If he were completely honest with himself,
he would realize that he had been whipped. It started with Cordelia, Faith
had dominated him, and now he was letting Anya do it. He wanted to blame
them, but he knew it was his fault that he got put in those positions.
He didn't stand up for himself. The only time he really ever spoke out
was against Angel. But that didn't help him any.</p>
<p>Everybody always said it was the guys who
treat women unfairly, but he was the exception. And he was sick of it.
He had to take a step forward and not let anyone push him back. Now was
a good a time as any. He had to start by saying something. Anything.</p>
<p>"What am I to you?" He asked Anya.</p>
<p>"You look like Xander, you sound like Xander,
so logically you would be Xander my -"</p>
<p>"You're what? Boyfriend? Live orgasm toy?
What?"</p>
<p>Anya was shocked. "You sound upset."</p>
<p>He started getting it all out, and didn't
think he could stop. "Gee, ya think? Every time we see each other, we either
go here and you get miffed over something, then we go do it. We see my
friends, you get bored, and then we go do it. I want more than that."</p>
<p>"Like what?"</p>
<p>"Movies, mini golf, go out to eat, something
with depth. Maybe because of all your years as a male-hating demon it makes
you think it's all right to use me, but I've done everything you asked,
haven't I?"</p>
<p>"I'm asserting my femininity to survive
in a male-dominated culture."</p>
<p>"Well hello, Demonic Spice. Guess what?
I'm not a culture; I'm not a society. I'm one guy, granted, with shortcomings,
but I want to feel like an equal part of, 'whatever' this is. Do you even
know what love is?"</p>
<p>"I've never seen this side of you before."</p>
<p>"Yeah, well maybe it's time you started
seeing more of it."</p>
<p>"I'll admit that some of your points were
valid."</p>
<p>"Some?"</p>
<p>"Okay, most."</p>
<p>"Good enough. So does this mean you'll
work with me on this? And I won't feel like the female anymore?"</p>
<p>Now Anya was appalled. "I've been acting
like a guy?"</p>
<p>"A little bit, yeah."</p>
<p>"So…if we do other stuff…do we still have
sex?"</p>
<p>"I'm still reasonably young, my hormones
are still very much active, so…yes. I just don't want that to be 'it',
you know?"</p>
<p>"You'll show me this other side?"</p>
<p>Xander nodded. "It'll be a step in the
right direction."</p>
<p>"We're not broken up?"</p>
<p>"Nope."</p>
<p>Anya smiled. "Another dance?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Faith and Buffy entered the Bronze a few
minutes after Willow and Tara. They were bruised, battered, but they won.
Which meant they were still alive. And that was a good thing. They even
got a souvenir that they'd show Giles in the morning. There was something
bizarre about the demon, and besides the obvious demonic qualities, they
couldn't figure out what.</p>
<p>Moving to the table their friends were
occupying, Buffy sat down next to Willow, but Faith stayed standing.</p>
<p>"I need food. Anyone want?"</p>
<p>"I'm up for munchies." Buffy said. Everyone
else shook their heads.</p>
<p>"Could you be more specific on what you're
up for?"</p>
<p>"Surprise me."</p>
<p>Faith grinned. "One surprise coming up."
She walked off.</p>
<p>"Why do I get the feeling I should be scared?"
Buffy asked her friends.</p>
<p>"You look good. Coming out?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>Buffy choked. "Wh…what?"</p>
<p>"Of the gloom you've been in. Feeling better?"</p>
<p>"Yes it's good to see you happy and breathing."
Anya added, though it was half-sincere and half-forced. Xander smiled at
her in encouragement.</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah. I'm dealing. Faith helped."</p>
<p>"I knew she would. She was so set on getting
you on the way to betterness." Willow said.</p>
<p>She wanted to talk to Buffy about what
Tara had said, but now didn't appear to be the right time. Later. They
would talk later. She couldn't sort this out herself. She had a feeling
Tara wouldn't mind, and she needed to tell someone.</p>
<p>"She has." Buffy turned her head and saw
Faith making her way back over.</p>
<p>"Um…has anyone else noticed the piece of
brown…uh…skin, on the table?" Tara asked.</p>
<p>"Is that what that is? I thought the Bronze
was trying to use some kind of new age tablecloth." Xander said.</p>
<p>"It's something that should give Giles
a research thrill. There was something freaky about this thing." Buffy
explained.</p>
<p>"Showing 'em our victory prize?" Faith
asked, sitting down between Buffy and Xander. She was holding a plate and
a bowl. The large piece of cheesecake was for her, and the banana split
in the bowl was for Buffy.</p>
<p>"God, I can't eat this."</p>
<p>"I'll say it again, B. Choose your words
more carefully. You're a twig anyway. Need to get some meat on there."
Faith said, pointing at the blonde.</p>
<p>"Do you want me to kick your ass?"</p>
<p>"Not particularly." They grasped hands
under the table, unbeknownst to anyone else. "So anyway, whatever this
thing was, it was wicked fast…"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Spike leaned up against the cave wall.
He really had no choice but to follow Adam deeper into the woods. The updated
 Terminator would have ripped him apart.
So he stood still while Adam went along the rows of bodies, some human,
some animal, but mostly demon. He was looking at the various states of
decay. His vampire lackeys had left a few minutes before.</p>
<p>"You wanted to cause them pain. Destroy
them."</p>
<p>"Some of your new boys got their jollies
by throwing me around one time."</p>
<p>"And yet you did not take action. Why?"</p>
<p>"To be honest mate, you."</p>
<p>"Were you afraid I would be angry? I know
all about emotions, but I cannot feel them."</p>
<p>"You're telling me you killed these blokes
on the floor…just because?"</p>
<p>"They are for my experiments. I know how
they function, but I am curious to see what happens when I change their
function. They are not all deceased."</p>
<p>To illustrate his point, the body of a
Sair, usually a vicious demon that looked rather reptilian, spasmed, and
then stopped.</p>
<p>"Right."</p>
<p>"Ah. I know what you fear. You fear ending
up like these specimens. Don't. You are too unique to change."</p>
<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p>"Unlike most of your kind, you feel emotion,
you care. And this is puzzling to me because all the testing I've done
tells me that demons do not feel. So are therefore evil. But you love.
A vampire. Druscilla."</p>
<p>"Do you have her? I swear if -"</p>
<p>"I only know that she was last seen in
the area two years ago and that you both shared love. Now this is an interesting
 development. Out of anger of wanting to
protect this vampire, your fear of me vanished."</p>
<p>"What do you want with me?"</p>
<p>"To learn about you. The chip in your neck
has been shut down, but you're weak. I wish to make you strong again. Then
you are free to leave."</p>
<p>"And how do are you gonna go about doing
that?"</p>
<p>"However you see fit." He saw Spike looking
at an empty space on the ground. "I had a specimen here. A Nynak. Usually
a slow moving creature, I injected fluids from the Sair you see there.
It's speed increased tremendously. I let it loose and watched. There must
have been side effects because it immediately went to the highest point
it could, and then I watched the slayers end its life. It was fascinating."</p>
<p>Spike's jaw clenched, and then he yelled.
"Damn those bloody frigging slayers!"</p>
<p>Adam's "lips" moved into an emotionless
smile.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy and Willow sat on their respective
beds later that night, almost ready to go to sleep. Someone was coming
tomorrow to fix the door, so for now they just barricaded it with a chair.
Willow was rubbing her hands together nervously. Not only was she apprehensive
about making a decision that could make Tara upset, but she was also worried
about her friend's reaction. Also, she hadn't ruled out of the possibility
of loving Tara in "that way", and it surprised her.</p>
<p>"Will? What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Okay…well…you know…that I fainted earlier
right?"</p>
<p>"Um…yeah."</p>
<p>"Well what you don't is the reason why
I fainted."</p>
<p>"Oh that. Tara said she loved you, and
you didn't know how to react."</p>
<p>Willow had to remember to breathe and stop
gaping. "You knew?"</p>
<p>"Faith and I are the ones that told her
to tell you. She was having a rough time, and we could see it all over
her face -"</p>
<p>"Whoa. Faith knows?"</p>
<p>"She's the one who told me. She's very
perceptive now that I think about it."</p>
<p>"And neither of you told me this…why?"</p>
<p>"Cause that wouldn't have been right. What
difference would it have made?"</p>
<p>"None…I guess. Probably would have avoided
her."</p>
<p>"See?" Buffy went to sit beside her friend.</p>
<p>"You're cool about it? I mean if I decided
to -"</p>
<p>"Totally. You're my friend, it's the Twenty-first
Century on the Hellmouth, and love…no one should put rules on it."</p>
<p>"Oh. Yeah. Good. Right. But what should
I do?"</p>
<p>"Come 'ere." Buffy hugged her friend. "Do
whatever you want to do. If you "love" love Tara, go for it. If not, then
don't. But if you find out you do, there's nothing wrong with that. And
I'll support you with whatever, you know that right?"</p>
<p>Buffy knew the hacker loved Tara, and as
much as she wanted to, she couldn't tell Willow what she felt for the other
girl. Willow was smart, and she would decipher her feelings eventually.
Buffy just wanted to see her friend happy, but she had to restrain herself.</p>
<p>Willow nodded. "I count on it."</p>
<p>"Good. Then there's something I gotta tell
you. Seeing as you're my friend and we have a mutual support system."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Faith and are…kinda together."</p>
<p>"Oh." Willow thought. "Ohhh. You had…sex
with her?"</p>
<p>"No! Well not yet. That's not a priority
right now."</p>
<p>"You did say Faith right? Her and sex go
together."</p>
<p>Willow went into interrogation mode. She
wasn't going to freak; she just wanted to know that Buffy knew what she
was doing, and that she would be okay. And it would have been rather mean
of her to flip just after Buffy had backed her up a minute ago.</p>
<p>"I know what you're thinking, but it's
not like that. We love each other, and it's new territory for both of us.
We don't want to screw…uh…mess things up."</p>
<p>"I'm a little surprised."</p>
<p>"That we're -"</p>
<p>"That Faith didn't automatically want to
do the deed."</p>
<p>"She's changed, is still, you know that.
And she likes sex, well everybody likes sex, but we've decided on nice
and slow. Work our way up to that."</p>
<p>"How long?</p>
<p>"Guess I liked her ever since I met her,
but the 'us' thing, officially just started today."</p>
<p>"Officially?"</p>
<p>"Kiss. During the sleepover."</p>
<p>"While Tara and I were -"</p>
<p>"Yep."</p>
<p>Willow took a deep breath. "As long as
you're happy…I hope everything works out for you two."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>Willow hugged her now. "Hey, you're my
friend. And you seem to think this is a good thing, Faith is…not so bad,
and it's nice to see you not mopey. Plus, the fact that she didn't try
to jump you…she must love you."</p>
<p>"We both do."</p>
<p>"Are you gonna tell the others?"</p>
<p>"Tell you what. If you and Tara become
a thing, we'll tell them together."</p>
<p>"Sounds like a plan."</p>
<p>They smiled at one another, and then Buffy
went back to her bed. It had been a long day, and it was time for sleep.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>The next day, Buffy walked to Giles'. She
saw Faith sitting against his front door. She smiled. Faith eventually
looked up at her and smiled too.</p>
<p>"Was waiting for ya."</p>
<p>Buffy walked over and sat down beside her.
"I had to make sure the campus handyman wouldn't steal anything, so I hung
around till he was done."</p>
<p>"You've been watching those FOX specials
too much."</p>
<p>"Hey. That's a good idea. I'll hide a video
camera -"</p>
<p>Faith reached over and pulled Buffy to
her. She pushed some of the blonde's hair behind her ear, and Buffy shifted
closer by wrapping her hands around Faith's neck. Their mouths melded,
tasted, and nipped for what seemed like quite a long time.</p>
<p>Faith couldn't believe kissing Buffy felt
like this. She was probably exaggerating, though at the moment she didn't
care, but it seemed almost as intense as sex. And she knew what it felt
like. This was pretty damn close, but it was also on a different level.
A deeper level. When she heard herself moan softly, she knew she had to
stop.</p>
<p>"God…Faith…wow. You're really good at that."</p>
<p>"Me? You…it…damn." No, that was nowhere
near good enough. "I really love you, B." That was good. It just rolled
off her tongue. And she didn't have to think about it.</p>
<p>"I love you too, F." Buffy giggled, and
leaned up against her. Faith instinctively went to hold her. She didn't
know if she was generally a hugger or not, but when it came to Buffy Summers
she sure as hell was. "Why were you sitting out here anyway?"</p>
<p>"Giles is testing the skin, and I was goin'
crazy. And he's using chemicals on it. I didn't want to be in there if
he blew something up."</p>
<p>"Good idea. Though the door could blow
outward."</p>
<p>"Hmmm…guess it could. But what a way to
go."</p>
<p>"You should really cut back on the romance.
I can't take it." Buffy said with playful sarcasm.</p>
<p>"You want romance? Okay, my blueberry love
muffin."</p>
<p>"That's just…creepy."</p>
<p>"Glad you think so, cause it sounded really
wrong. Not us."</p>
<p>"Well we'll have to figure out what 'fits'
us."</p>
<p>"I'm liking that."</p>
<p>They felt the door move behind them, and
got up quickly so as not to fall. Or get caught.</p>
<p>"Hey, Giles. What'd you find?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"Hello, Buffy. Feeling better?"</p>
<p>"Much."</p>
<p>"Glad to hear it. I think…you better come
in so I can explain. It seems Adam has stepped up his experimentation process."</p>
<p>"How do you know it was him?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>"He's the only one who would do this. From
what…Riley told me…" Faith put her hand on Buffy's shoulder when she saw
her eyes. They became sad quickly. "The Initiative does not do what has
been done to this demon. At least not while its alive."</p>
<p>"Then fill us in." Buffy said, smiling
at him.</p>
<p>He went inside, and the girls followed.</p>
<p>"You wanna get something to eat at that
place on Main after this?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>"Do you ever stop eating?"</p>
<p>"Slayer metabolism. Weight's a non-issue.
Man, I gotta start gettin' you to enjoy eating."</p>
<p>"I enjoy eating. Just not in bulk." Buffy
grinned.</p>
<p>Faith could have responded to the jibe,
but Giles was around. "Yay or Nay?"</p>
<p>"A big, affirmative yay."</p>
<p>"You're lucky."</p>
<p>"Am I?"</p>
<p>"You have no idea."</p>
<p>Faith kicked the door shut behind them.</p>
