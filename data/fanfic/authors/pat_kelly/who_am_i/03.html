<p>Falling books off a shelf…</p>
<p>Sitting behind the desk watching her hair
fall on her shoulder…</p>
<p>Walking beside her down the hall…</p>
<p>Touching her cheek…</p>
<p>Seeing her strength for the first time…</p>
<p>Touching her skin when they made love…</p>
<p>"Buffy…"</p>
<p>"He's awake." A scientist said.</p>
<p>"Did he just say what I think he said?"
Graham asked.</p>
<p>"His memories are intact for the most part.
How fragmented, we can't be sure."</p>
<p>"He's immobile, right?"</p>
<p>"We've taken the proper precautions. We
have more control with this one. A repeat of the prototype's attack on
Walsh is not a danger this time."</p>
<p>"But memories are. We can't have him remembering
her. She might be able to convince him to go against our instructions,
and that's the last thing we need."</p>
<p>"His brain is what gives him the ability
to have some free will. Making him into a complete drone would be a mistake.
If we have five hundred of these on the battlefield, for us to control
them all would be -"</p>
<p>"We're not on a battlefield."</p>
<p>"I appreciate your position, however, we
can't delete individual memories."</p>
<p>"Then suppress a group of them somehow.
We can upload any knowledge he might lose."</p>
<p>"Buffy…" Riley's slightly deeper, and scratchier
voice said again.</p>
<p>"Put him under again. We have some finishing
connections to make to the hardware, and we're going to get it right."
The scientist said to his colleagues.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Willow walked into Giles' house finding
the downstairs empty. She was a little puzzled, but given her going nowhere,
inner puzzle revolving around Tara, it was nice to shift gears. If only
for a few minutes.</p>
<p>"Giles? Faith?" No answer.</p>
<p>She began to search the house. She didn't
think they were in any trouble, because nothing looked wrecked, and the
front door wouldn't have been unlocked if they weren't here, so they had
to be somewhere. As she walked upstairs, her thoughts found their way back
onto the 'Tara situation.'</p>
<p>They had been friends for several months
now, and she really liked the shy blonde. Tara reminded Willow of herself,
oh…from about four years ago. Willow had watched her gain more confidence
in herself and people, and Willow liked to think she had had a hand in
that. Bringing her friend out of her shell.</p>
<p>Just like Buffy…and…Oz had helped Willow
to do.</p>
<p>Spending time with Tara had helped her
get over Oz. And she was over him. She had wanted to be for so long, and
it had been killing her inside that she wasn't able to pull herself up
and get back to being "her". Oz had been her first relationship, love,
and coping with him up and leaving like that was hard. And she didn't like
feeling miserable. Plus, his reasons for doing that were just smoke.</p>
<p>'Oh I have to learn to control the wolf,
Willow…I've never truly loved anybody till you…blah, blah…' She thought
to
 herself.</p>
<p>Now, whenever she thought about him, she
just became angry. He decided to run away from her. Did she say she couldn't
handle it? They lived on a Hellmouth where nearly everything was supernatural,
and there were risks. They could've worked through it together. Didn't
he know that skipping town didn't fix anything? It certainly hadn't with
Buffy. If he truly loved her, he would've stayed.</p>
<p>She could've dealt with the Veruca thing
over time, but him leaving had been like a punch in the gut. It left her
winded, and it had been awhile before she felt like she could breathe again.
Maybe she didn't fully understand the wolf thing, but she knew what it
was like to be able to do something that you couldn't really control. And
if, or when, he came back, she hoped that he didn't expect her to take
him back.</p>
<p>Wasn't going to happen. She had dealt with
the pain, she had moved on. Had she? Tara really made her happy. It was
a nice bonus that she was also a witch who thought she didn't have much
power. Willow connected and identified immediately with her. Like OJ Simpson
and a glove. All she knew was that she got a rush of happy feelings whenever
Tara was around.</p>
<p>When they grasped hands, it was like a
stream of electricity passed through them. And she couldn't ignore some
of the powerful sensations and connections they felt and made during spells.
But did that mean she liked Tara in "that" way? Did she want to like her
in "that" way? She hadn't thought much about kissing her, but Tara thought
about kissing her obviously, and that excited Willow more than she let
herself realize.</p>
<p>No matter who it was, she was very flattered
when people found her attractive enough to want to go beyond friendship.
Even after all her personal hurdles, she was still surprised that anyone
would think of her as girlfriend material. The possibility of being labeled
"gay" was not a factor in her making a decision. Her best friend was behind
her; she was in a very open college that displayed a 'Lesbian Alliance'
banner in its lounge plain as day…so no, that wasn't an issue.</p>
<p>It was a love issue. She wanted to be sure
that's what she felt. It would be unfair to Tara if she wasn't. Buffy had
told her that her feelings for Faith had been buried for almost two years,
and only just now had they been brought to the surface. She had only known
Tara a little over a half a year and the blonde had caught her off guard.
But the thought of taking that step was becoming more appealing; she had
to admit that.</p>
<p>She just didn't know. Maybe she needed
a second opinion.</p>
<p>Checking all over the house, she still
couldn't find them. Finally, out of desperation, and because she really
didn't like it when she had to panic, she checked the roof of the house.
Sure enough, there they were. Giles was reading a book, and Faith was doing
some sort of stretching exercise. It seemed to be improving her flexibility.</p>
<p>'That explains her reputation as a good
lay…bad Willow! She's your friend, and that's mean. She's a nice person,
and
 you know you like her.'</p>
<p>Be that as it may, Faith was involved with
Buffy now, and she had to make sure Faith knew what her position was.</p>
<p>"Hey." Willow said, announcing her presence.</p>
<p>Giles looked up from his book. "Hello,
Willow."</p>
<p>"Hey, Red." Faith said. She only used real
names when she was being serious about something, Willow had figured out.</p>
<p>"Interesting chemical set up you have down
there, Giles." Willow commented, remembering the cluttered table. "Spell?"</p>
<p>"No…I was testing the skin Buffy and Faith
brought me. It seems as though Adam is now trying to mix breeds, which
would explain the quickness of the demon they encountered last night."</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"They're usually very slow-moving."</p>
<p>"Oh. I knew that." Willow blushed. "You're
sure it was Adam?"</p>
<p>"The Initiative, from what I understand,
captures demons for the purposes of collecting parts, not creating hybrids.
Adam must want new data."</p>
<p>"Fun." Faith stopped stretching and walked
over. "Where's Buffy?"</p>
<p>"She said she had to go do something. Book
man seems to know, but he isn't talkin'." Faith said, looking at Giles
suspiciously. "But B promised to fill me in later, so I'm cool with it."</p>
<p>Now Willow looked at Giles.</p>
<p>"All I know is who was on the phone."</p>
<p>"Yeah?" Willow and Faith both asked.</p>
<p>"She made me promise to keep silent, and
she said she would tell you both in good time."</p>
<p>The redhead and the brown-haired slayer
both had annoyed looks on their faces as they turned around and went back
into the house.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy hardly ever visited during the day.
It was surprisingly less creepy in the light. She walked along the rows
of gravestones, deep into the cemetery. She had picked a somewhat isolated
spot, and smiled when she saw the fresh stone the keeper of the grounds
had situated into the ground. The simple writing read:</p>
<p>RILEY FINN</p>
<p>-A GOOD MAN-</p>
<p>1979-2000</p>
<p>"Hey." She said. "Okay, I know you're not
actually buried here, but let's just pretend you can hear me, okay? And
pray that nobody comes by and hears me talking to myself."</p>
<p>Buffy pulled a chain out of her pocket
and sat it on the ground by the grave. "I don't know what they did with
your body. The only thing I was able to get out of Graham was your dog
tag. Hey, maybe they buried you in one of those military graveyards in
Washington DC. You deserve it. You shouldn't have died in the first place,
and…I'm sorry. You really didn't deserve that."</p>
<p>She sighed and sat on the ground. "I know
this isn't much, but I had to do something. You lived a good life, and
I loved you. And the fact that you loved me…and chose to risk…that meant
a lot to me. Especially cause of who I am. That would scare most people
off. I won't ever forget that. And the world should know you lived in it
once.</p>
<p>"They didn't even have a funeral. They
could have at least given one for show. I got Will to look up your records
in the college mainframe right after Faith and I got back, and they were
already deleted." Anger flashed across her face. "Bastards. We'll get 'em.
Promise.</p>
<p>"I locked myself in my room for awhile.
Will was really cool about it. And we're roomies. But you knew that. I
called here, and had them make up the stone. They asked me if I wanted
to come and pick a spot, but I knew the cemetery by heart. Sad, isn't it?"</p>
<p>She laughed quietly. "Anyway, I tried to
pick a nice spot. One far enough away from rising new born vamps.</p>
<p>"I think…you should…know that Faith and
I are kinda in a relationship type thing. It's scary, new, but I'm happy
when she's around. Um…please don't hate me?"</p>
<p>Buffy ran her hands through her hair. "I'm
not really good at these things, and I know I sound really pathetic, but
please don't ever think I'm trying to push you out of my mind. Even if
I wanted to, I wouldn't be able to. I've found out that I really hate being
alone, and I do love Faith. And she loves me. But then I wonder if I should
let myself feel happiness after...do I even deserve it?</p>
<p>"I'm doing it again. But I wish you could
tell me you're okay with it. I hope you are." She got on her knees, pulled
her red
 bandana scarf from her coat pocket, and
laid it on top of the gravestone. "This belongs to you. You liked it better
than I did. It was only the scarf part of me, really."</p>
<p>She smiled. "I loved you, Riley. Please
know that. And I hope you're peaceful wherever they put you up there. I'm
doing a lot of hoping, aren't I? Guess cause that's all I have, and I'm
hoping, need to seriously get a bigger vocabulary, that it's enough. I'll
leave you alone now."</p>
<p>As much as she promised herself she wasn't
going to cry, and knew that she had only been talking to a stone, she couldn't
stop the stray tear that rolled down her cheek as she ran her fingers over
the engraved words. The description on the tombstone was very simple, but
it was true. He was a good man, and even though he had been debating that,
he really hadn't needed to. She knew who he was, and who he would have
been capable of becoming.</p>
<p>"Goodbye." She said softly. Her voice choked
on the word, and she could barely get it out. She got up after a minute,
and began the trek out of the graveyard.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"Please…" A frightened teenage boy, said.</p>
<p>"Please what?" Spike asked, taking a drag
of his cigarette.</p>
<p>Even though it was day, he had been able
to follow the kid because of the shade the trees provided. The kid had
been hiking, and his body hadn't been up to running. Which was fine with
Spike. He dragged him back to the cave, and tossed him on the ground. Even
though it was creepy, he let Adam watch. He tried to fool himself into
thinking he had a choice in the matter.</p>
<p>"Let me go…"</p>
<p>"Why would I do that?" He threw the cigarette
to the ground, and crushed it with his foot. "Out of the goodness of my
heart? Don't think so."</p>
<p>"What do you want?"</p>
<p>"A meal." He let his face shift. His demon
knew sustenance when it saw it. "It's been too bloody long since I've fed
off a
 human."</p>
<p>"Oh God…" The kid was crying now.</p>
<p>"I still expect him to show up when people
say that, but I'm always disappointed. I promise it'll be quick. And…relatively
 painless."</p>
<p>He grabbed his victim's head, and pushed
it so it was at an angle. Seeing the boy's thick neck, he growled low in
his throat, bared his fangs, and began to feed. There was no screaming.
He had to give the kid his respect for that, but within seconds the heart
stopped, and he had drained him dry.</p>
<p>"An intriguing process. How do you feel?"
Adam asked, coming out of the shadows.</p>
<p>"Sated."</p>
<p>"This helps you regain strength?"</p>
<p>"Boosts my confidence, yeah. Blood gives
the muscles some strength too. We don't eat, we weaken. Human blood is
the preferred brand."</p>
<p>"You also seem to enjoy taunting before
the feed as well."</p>
<p>"Power gives me a rush, what can I say?"</p>
<p>"You feel, yet you kill and are classified
as evil. I am programmed to kill, do not feel, and am evil. I don't understand."</p>
<p>"You're not really evil. You're not exactly
good either. To be evil, you have to feel. I enjoy what I do; I feel it
when they
 scream, the chase, the adrenaline, all
things that add to the enjoyment. I only kill slayers for sport, rest is
food. I'm a
 conservationist."</p>
<p>"To be truly evil you have to take pleasure
in doing evil acts."</p>
<p>"Right."</p>
<p>"I do not feel pleasure when I take a life."</p>
<p>"That's because you're a machine. Built
by someone who wanted to make you into a mindless killing bastard. You're
your own, independent cyborg, but you don't have a true mind of your own."</p>
<p>"Is that supposed to upset me?"</p>
<p>"It'd upset anyone and everyone but you.
You're neutral, pal. Do you know why you kill?"</p>
<p>"It's in my programming."</p>
<p>"At least you have enough free will to
choose who your victims are." Spike was particularly grateful for that.
"Did you learn enough? Cause I need to get drunk."</p>
<p>"Yes. For now."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Faith showered after the two of them came
in, and Willow went to kill some time on the couch. When she was finished,
she slipped on a bathrobe Giles had graciously though somewhat reluctantly,
the man was unemployed after all, given her the money for. She entered
her room, bare as it was, and shut the door behind her. She almost had
a heart attack when she turned around and saw Willow sitting up against
the headboard of her bed.</p>
<p>The redhead's face was expressionless.
"So…I know."</p>
<p>Faith's first reaction was to laugh. Willow
had an interrogation face on, and as serious as she was, it was also a
little comical. But then the Wiccan crossed her arms over chest, and Faith
saw her eyes. She got the feeling that this wasn't something she should
joke about.</p>
<p>"Know what?"</p>
<p>"About you and Buffy."</p>
<p>"Oh." It was going to be one of those talks.
"And?"</p>
<p>"I was kinda shocked."</p>
<p>Faith suddenly realized how much she wanted
Willow's support on this. "You think I was expecting it? I thought about
it,
 dreamed about it, and then she says it.
If I wasn't laying down when she said it, I would've fallen on my ass."</p>
<p>Willow's eyes bugged out, and she lost
her composure quickly. "Laying down?"</p>
<p>The slayer grinned. "Not what you think,
Willow. What's going on in that head?"</p>
<p>"Sorry…just…you and lying down…" That stung,
and it showed on Faith's face. "I'm not usually that blunt. I shouldn't
-"</p>
<p>"I love her. Believe it or don't."</p>
<p>"Why should I?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"Buffy's very fragile…and if she loves
you and you love her…that's…I'm happy for both of you, but I have to watch
out for her. So if you don't mean it -"</p>
<p>"I mean it. Haven't stuck by much in my
life, but if I ever hurt her again, especially cause of what we've done
and where we are, I'd kill myself."</p>
<p>Willow heard the forcefulness in Faith's
voice. "What exactly have you done?"</p>
<p>"A little curious are we? Wouldn't have
anything to do with -"</p>
<p>"Stay on topic." Willow tried not to stutter.</p>
<p>Faith chuckled. "Okay, okay…we've kissed,
but you probably know that."</p>
<p>"And?"</p>
<p>"What? You want me to give you a description?
There aren't enough words, Red."</p>
<p>"Look me in the eyes." Willow got up and
stood almost toe to toe with Faith. She searched Faith's eyes. "Oh my God…you
do."</p>
<p>"Don't say anything I don't mean. Unless
I'm lying. Which I'm not."</p>
<p>"I believe you, but believe me when I say,
if you hurt her, I'll attempt to beat you to death with a shovel. Very
hard. So promise me."</p>
<p>Faith was now scared. Willow swinging a
shovel was dangerous at every angle she pictured it in. And with magick
behind her…</p>
<p>"I promise. That shovel…descriptive. You
read the riot act a lot?"</p>
<p>"You and…Riley."</p>
<p>They both didn't want to go down that road.</p>
<p>"Five by five?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. Faith I…you and Buffy know each
other pretty well cause you're slayers and all…she gets you in a way I
don't, and I'm not asking you to open up or anything…but I just want you
to know that I like to see my friends happy. And if you and Buffy can do
that for each other, great. You both deserve it because of your lives being
so gloomy a lot.</p>
<p>"You're my friend too, and I didn't just
grill you for Buffy's sake, but for yours too. Love is something…you have
to be careful with. You get hurt sometimes…but I don't want to see that
happen with you guys. I want you to have happies."</p>
<p>Faith was a little blown away. "I…um…thanks."</p>
<p>Willow smiled, and looked suddenly unsure.
"And…because you're my friend, I'm gonna ask you for help now."</p>
<p>"You've got a knack for being able to switch
gears, you know that? What's the prob?"</p>
<p>"Tara."</p>
<p>"I don't know if I should…what do you want
me to do?"</p>
<p>"I can't figure out what I'm feeling, and
I know you know."</p>
<p>"I assumed you were already together when
I saw you cause you seemed tight. But you weren't."</p>
<p>"You saw something."</p>
<p>Faith held her hands up. "Can't do it.
But there may be only one way for you to figure out what you feel."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Kiss her. And I'm not talkin' a peck on
the cheek. Mouth to mouth but without the resuscitation. If you kiss her…and…well,
you'll know one way or the other."</p>
<p>"Just like that?"</p>
<p>"Somehow I don't think she'd object."</p>
<p>"Faith! Giles!" Buffy yelled from downstairs.</p>
<p>"It's up to you. Now, I'd like to get changed
so…"</p>
<p>"Uh…right. I'll go…Buffy…"</p>
<p>Willow left the room, and Faith had to
crack up. The redhead was so innocent it was unbelievable. She respected
her for it though. Innocence was a hard thing to hold onto. Especially
in this town. Grinning, she started to get changed.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy saw Willow come down after a minute.</p>
<p>"Didn't know you were here, Will." She
said cautiously.</p>
<p>"How could you of?" Willow asked. "Faith'll
be down in a sec."</p>
<p>There were three scenarios she could think
of involving Faith and Willow. A fight, though she didn't see any bruises
or gashes; a more pleasurable scenario she preferred not to consider, plus
she highly doubted it; and the final one, a conversation. That looked to
be the most plausible. Willow didn't seem angry, which was good, but they
most likely had been discussing her.</p>
<p>"Good point."</p>
<p>"Where'd you go?"</p>
<p>"Cemetery. I had something I had to give
to Riley."</p>
<p>Willow walked up to her. "I'm sure he appreciated
it. Whatever you did."</p>
<p>"I hope so." Buffy smiled at her friend.
"What'd you and Faith talk about?"</p>
<p>"Relax, B. We just dealt with some issues."
Faith said, coming down the stairs.</p>
<p>"Looking good." Buffy said with a grin.</p>
<p>"Don't I always?"</p>
<p>Buffy cleared her throat. "So…the issues
were 'Us' issues?"</p>
<p>"Among other things, yeah."</p>
<p>"But it's all worked out?"</p>
<p>"Uh huh. Totally. I think we reached an
understanding or two about things." Willow reassured, and then smiled at
Faith.</p>
<p>Buffy sighed. "Good. Where's Giles?"</p>
<p>"He can't hear where he is. I'll get him."
Willow walked off.</p>
<p>"Why doesn't he just use the courtyard?"</p>
<p>"He's got that mini-garden up there. Plus
he says it's quieter." Faith explained, shrugging. They went to the couch,
and Buffy laid down. "Gonna have to make room."</p>
<p>Buffy sat up a little, and Faith squeezed
in. When she was sure Faith was situated, Buffy laid her head on Faith's
lap.</p>
<p>"So…where'd you go?" Faith asked after
adjusting to the position they were in. Buffy didn't seem to care that
Giles would be coming in, so neither did she.</p>
<p>"Saying goodbye."</p>
<p>Faith got it quickly. "You okay?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. I'm just glad that he doesn't have
to suffer in this hellhole anymore. Don't get me wrong, I love this town.
Just don't like what's under it."</p>
<p>"I hear ya. Be glad he's not a vamp too.
Cause then you'd have to…"</p>
<p>"Poof him? I am, cause I don't know if
I could do it."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Vampires were getting their limbs torn
off like toothpicks. All eight up of them were trying to find some way
to escape, but they were trapped. A strong fist crushed one's skull. A
skewer turned another to dust. One by one, they were all perishing. And
in a hidden room, there were congratulations all around.</p>
<p>"Record time, and all kills were executed
exactly as ordered. I think we've done it." A scientist said.</p>
<p>"One last test." Graham said. He switched
on a microphone that protruded out of the panel he was standing over, and
spoke into it. "Looks like you didn't need Buffy's help for this one."</p>
<p>Inside the room where the battle took place,
Riley stayed quiet for a minute.</p>
<p>"I don't recognize that name."</p>
<p>"Well done." Graham said smiling. He turned
to the scientist. "He goes on assignment in a few days. I want him completely
ready."</p>
<p>"That's a little more complicated..."</p>
<p>"It'll give us another advantage, and we
need all we can get. Get it done."</p>
<p>"Yes…sir."</p>

<p>The Bronze was a place of raging hormones.
That was a fact nobody would deny. But this particular night, the hormone
levels were just the slightest bit higher than normal. Anyone who was watching
would say the levels were more like astronomically higher, and depending
on the varying reactions of the onlookers, they'd probably be right. They
didn't make it obvious they were looking, but the people their gazes were
fixed on, knew.</p>
<p>And they didn't give a damn.</p>
<p>The girls, who were the center of everyone's
attention, didn't stop from one dance to the next. They just kept going,
like they were performing a never-ending ballet. And a highly provocative
one at that. Blonde matched brown, neither leading nor succumbing. Both
very independent, very equal partners in what they were doing. Yes, partners.
That's what they were. Moving beat for beat in synchronized motions. All
they lived for was the moment. An infinite stretch of time that ended only
when they said so.</p>
<p>As a new song began, without thinking,
they changed their pattern to keep with the tempo. It's pulsing beat signified
that it was a quickly paced song, but slow enough for the girls to still
maintain the sensual, intimate, closeness of their gyrations, which they
weren't about to give up. The blonde raised her arms above her head, which
were met by the delicate, yet firm pair of hands belonging to her companion.</p>
<p>"Last one, B." Faith whispered.</p>
<p>"Let's go out with a bang then." Buffy
said, raw passion in her voice.</p>
<p>"I love you."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>Faith guided Buffy's arms behind her neck,
and Buffy held on as the vocals began.</p>
<p><i>This is our game and we have control,</i></p>
<p><i>We make the moves and we make the rules,</i></p>
<p><i>But maybe we're just being fooled</i></p>
<p><i>In a sea of chance we wound up together</i></p>
<p><i>Never really questioned where we found
ourselves</i></p>
<p><i>Never really wondered about forever</i></p>
<p>Buffy pushed back into Faith as the dark-haired
slayer slid her hands down Buffy's arms, and continued down her body, each
hand moving slowly down the blonde's sides. When Faith felt that she reached
the waist, she brought her arms around the front, her hands meeting and
fingers interlocking. She pulled Buffy back, further into her.</p>
<p><i>Are we just pawns moving at life's pace?</i></p>
<p><i>Under the illusion that this is our
race?</i></p>
<p><i>Is the struggle really worth the reward
at the end?</i></p>
<p>Faith closed her eyes as she felt Buffy's
hands run through her hair. The petite slayer was able to reach her hands
over Faith's head, and lay her hands atop hers. Faith bent her head, smelling
Buffy's hair, her skin, inhaling the scent. She brought her lips to the
soft flesh just below her ear, and nipped. She had a small grin as she
heard Buffy's intake of breath.</p>
<p><i>Before you came my foundations were
solid,</i></p>
<p><i>Limits tested and boundaries set,</i></p>
<p><i>Other side and I had never met</i></p>
<p><i>You appeared and reality distorted,</i></p>
<p><i>The game's rules were aborted,</i></p>
<p><i>Got to see beyond my sphere</i></p>
<p>Buffy began to turn to face her, and Faith
widened her arms just enough. Body brushed against body, their hips never
slowing once. They began to move a few steps, and people cleared a path.
In an unexpected move that caught Buffy off-guard for a second, Faith released
her loose hold, and began to circle Buffy closely, eyes locked on hers.</p>
<p><i>Are we just pawns moving at life's pace?</i></p>
<p><i>Under the illusion that this is our
race?</i></p>
<p><i>Is the struggle really worth the reward
at the end?</i></p>
<p>Faith wasn't getting off that easy. Buffy
matched her movements, and stopped Faith in the middle of a step. She reached
for hand, took it, and pulled Faith to her. She pecked at Faith's Harlet-covered
bottom lip, and grinned. She brought her knee between Faith's legs, and
then the Bostonian took her turn and wrapped her arms around Buffy's neck
as they continued to dance.</p>
<p><i>It's not good to be too bad and bad
to be too good,</i></p>
<p><i>Separate we can't find that even ground,</i></p>
<p><i>Maybe together we could</i></p>
<p><i>Don't know when you became my lifeline,</i></p>
<p><i>From the walls I let confine,</i></p>
<p><i>But we're the game's key players now</i></p>
<p>The song was slowing now, and so were
they.</p>
<p>"Jesus…" Faith exhaled.</p>
<p>"Think we were entertaining enough?"</p>
<p>"I know I was satisfied."</p>
<p>"Were you?"</p>
<p>They separated slowly, hands losing contact
at the last possible second. And then in a bold move, not caring who was
around, Faith captured Buffy's mouth with hers. Buffy, shocked as she was,
couldn't deny her partner this. Couldn't deny herself this. It only lasted
all but three seconds, but time was a relative thing. And it confirmed
to the both of them that they were still in reality.</p>
<p><i>We are one in the sea</i></p>
<p><i>Are we just pawns moving at life's pace?</i></p>
<p><i>Under the illusion that this is our
race?</i></p>
<p><i>Is the struggle really worth the reward
at the end?</i></p>
<p>The song over, they stared at the people
who had been watching. The two of them dared anyone to say a word. No one
did. As they moved back over to their table, the noise level resumed its
normal volume, and time moved forward once again.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Back at the table, Willow and Tara were
trying to get their jaws to work again. The phrase "you're face will get
stuck that way" was becoming less and less of an old wives' tale by the
second. Watching Buffy and Faith, among other things, made them feel a
little guilty. Even though they allowed the whole Bronze to view them.
What the slayers did, they couldn't think of an
 appropriate term, seemed very personal.</p>
<p>Willow stared down at her soda, and then
up at Tara.</p>
<p>"Soda doesn't seem like the best idea right
now." Tara nodded in agreement. "How's water sound?"</p>
<p>"Good...throat's a little dry…"</p>
<p>Willow began to get up. "Yeah…I'll make
sure it's cold."</p>
<p>"To cool down."</p>
<p>"Right. Cause it's hot in here." They both
looked around nervously, and then Willow walked over to the bar.</p>
<p>Tara looked up as Buffy and Faith approached
the table, and despite her previous embarrassment, had to crack a small
smile. It was obvious the girls had enjoyed themselves. Faith sat on the
empty stool, and Buffy sat on her knee. She could see the love, but they
weren't the kind of couple that went out of their way to show people they
were in love.</p>
<p>Well, under normal circumstances. Which
was anywhere but dance floors.</p>
<p>They seemed so comfortable with their relationship.
People's opinions, gazes, didn't seem to affect them. Tara guessed it was
because they didn't really have time to worry about what people thought.
And they didn't seem like the type of people to care anyhow. She wished
she and Willow could do that. Well, their relationship wasn't very clearly
defined at the moment, so Tara supposed she was jumping the gun a little
bit.</p>
<p>"I've…uh…never seen anything like that
before." Tara said slowly.</p>
<p>"Did we look really stupid or something?"
Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"I think she means…" Faith whispered Buffy
the rest.</p>
<p>"Oh." Buffy blushed, and then grinned.
"I don't think anybody in here has."</p>
<p>"You and Will should get those plevis'
movin'." Faith said.</p>
<p>"Well…I uh…I don't think so." Tara said,
face red.</p>
<p>"Why not? Don't tell me she's still being
-"</p>
<p>"Sssh!" Buddy shushed Faith as Willow came
back with four water bottles.</p>
<p>The redhead handed the three of them each
a bottle, and sat down on her stool. As much as they tried to hide it,
she knew what they all wanted her to do. It had been about a week since
she and Faith had had their talk, and she hadn't been able to work up the
guts to just flat out kiss Tara. She wanted there to be a moment, a right
time. But if she didn't think of Tara in a romantic way, there would be
no need for a "right moment" in the first place. She was so confused.</p>
<p>"Do you two have any energy left?" Willow
asked.</p>
<p>Buffy took a swig of her water. "We're
the real-life Energizer Bunnies. Only…without the fir. And the drums."</p>
<p>"Where do you come up with these analogies?
Are you in the special class on campus or something?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you knew 'analogy' was
a word. Let alone use it appropriately in a sentence." Buffy retorted.</p>
<p>"Touch&eacute;." Faith conceded.</p>
<p>Willow and Tara exchanged glances as they
watched the exchange of jibes. The glance turned into a look, the look
turned into a gaze, and the gaze became a staring contest. But nobody was
going to win. When they mutually broke off eye contact, they saw their
friends staring at them with knowing smiles.</p>
<p>Buffy moved off of Faith, and they both
looked at the girls, rather focused glints in their eyes. The wiccans were
scared, too scared to move. Buffy got behind Willow, and Faith got behind
Tara.</p>
<p>"This for your own good ladies." Faith
said. "Coulda done it the easy way, but you just had to let it drag. Time
to get things on track."</p>
<p>"Buffy?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"Trust me, Will. We just wanna see you
happy." Buffy said, holding her friend by the shoulders.</p>
<p>"What are you talking ab -" Tara started,
but got cut off as Faith gave her a little nudge.</p>
<p>But a little nudge from a slayer was like
a decent shove from a 'normal' person, so Tara lost her balance and fell
forward off the stool. Willow caught her before she hit the ground, and
she smiled at the redhead. Buffy moved away from Willow, and all Tara could
hear was the other witch's breathing.</p>
<p>For Willow, as she still grasped Tara's
arms, she felt a sensation shoot through her body. The blonde's smile,
her eyes, her soft voice, it all hit her like a freight train. And even
though they ended up in their current position rather unceremoniously,
and it wasn't the most private place in the world, this was the moment.</p>
<p>The time when everything finally made sense
to her. She felt it when they first met, and whenever they were together.
She recognized the love she had let stay hidden, and now it just wanted
to explode out. But she couldn't. Not here. Not in the Bronze. Not...</p>
<p>"Damn it, Red. Kiss her already." Faith
said.</p>
<p>"You…you…don't…have -" Tara said, not believing
this was happening.</p>
<p>"Only one way to find out, right?" Willow
asked in a hushed tone.</p>
<p>Willow leaned down and kissed Tara's lips
softly, tentatively, not sure what to expect. Tara's mouth parted, her
breath mixing with Willow's. This continued into short, soft kisses along
the contours of each other's mouths.</p>
<p>"I…um…guys…you might wanna…" Buffy urged
gently, looking toward the entrance.</p>
<p>"Wrap it up." Faith said more forcefully.</p>
<p>But by the time they did, it was too late.</p>
<p>"Huh? What…" Willow trailed off as she
went wide-eyed.</p>
<p>"Look, it's the X-Man and his girl." Faith
said.</p>
<p>"Hey." Xander said slowly.</p>
<p>Anya simply smirked. "What'd we miss?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"Let's play Who Wants to Be a Millionaire!"
Regis' voice projected from the TV.</p>
<p>Giles enjoyed the American version much
better than the one he had seen on his infrequent trips to London. The
contestants in the show overseas were always nervous, shy and fidgety from
what he saw. But in the American version, the contestants told you their
life story. It was rather amusing. Plus it was more fun to yell it them
if they got it wrong.</p>
<p>"What band has a member who is most recognizable
by the size of his lips?</p>
<p>"Is it:</p>
<p>"A: The Beatles?</p>
<p>"B: The Monkees</p>
<p>"C: The Backstreet Boys</p>
<p>"Or D: The Rolling Stones?"</p>
<p>Even though the contestant was a computer
programmer from California with a pocket protector, he had to know the
answer. Everyone knew the answer. It was so obvious.</p>
<p>"Hmmm…I was thinking Steven Tyler…but Aerosmith's
not up there…and I remember the Monkees…their lips all seemed pretty regular…I
never was really into the Beatles craze…and…" The contestant rambled on.</p>
<p>"Come on! Pillock! It's the hundred dollar
question for God's sake!" Giles said trying to repress his rage.</p>
<p>"I've never…I mean I hear the Stones a
lot on the radio…"</p>
<p>"Oh they allow radios in the cubicles?"
Regis joked, deadpan.</p>
<p>"I'm going to have to ask the audience."</p>
<p>The phone began to ring. "Ask the audience?
Bloody moron. Never heard of Mick Jagger, have you? Americans."</p>
<p>As Giles picked up the phone, he heard
Regis speak again.</p>
<p>"There you go. One hundred percent of the
audience thinks D is the right answer. I don't think we've ever had unanimous
agreement on this show before."</p>
<p>"I'll have to go with D as my final answer
then."</p>
<p>"You better. There's no chance in hell
you're getting up to -" Giles started, but then got cut off by Olivia's
frantic voice on the
 other end of the line. "Olivia? What's
the matter?"</p>
<p>"I came home from a friend's flat about
thirty minutes ago and…"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"There were men from that Council you told
me about at my door. They just left."</p>
<p>Giles paled. "What did they want?"</p>
<p>"They asked me questions about a Faith
person. And I remembered her from when I was over there last and I guess
they must have followed me…I told them she was staying with you. I didn't
think much of it until I overheard them say…"</p>
<p>He slid his glasses off his face and closed
his eyes. "It's not your fault. I should have informed you better."</p>
<p>"I'm the one who didn't want to know about
slayers and hellmouths…what did I do, Ripper?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. It'll be fine. Now did they say
when they might arrive here?"</p>
<p>"Tomorrow night I think. Your time."</p>
<p>"Thank you. I'll call you as soon as I
can." He hung up. "They don't know when to give up."</p>
<p>Faith and Buffy had to come by. Faith lived
there after all. He just hoped it was sooner rather than later.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"Ah…what do you say we go for a walk?"
Buffy asked, trying to find some way to break the tension. "As much as
I like public displays, I think we've all given the Bronze enough of a
show tonight."</p>
<p>"Agreed." Faith said, but still shot a
suggestive leer Buffy's way for good measure.</p>
<p>"Yeah…good idea." Willow and Tara said
quickly, standing up.</p>
<p>The four girls led the way out, getting
as far ahead of Xander and Anya as possible. Xander followed with his ex-demon
 girlfriend, staying silent all the way
out the door.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah. We missed something big." Anya
said, pleased with her previous deduction.</p>
<p>The silence was creepy. They walked along
the sidewalk, leaving the bad side of town, and nobody spoke. It was like
waiting for a bomb to tick down its seconds before it exploded. You knew
it was going to happen, but you also knew you wouldn't be ready for it.
They all risked looks in Xander's direction to see how far away he was
from blowing up. There was a vein protruding from his forehead, but that's
all they could make out.</p>
<p>On autopilot, they all seemed to be moving
in the direction of Giles' house. They walked down Main Street, looking
at the various stores, afraid to say a word. Past the Expresso Pump, past
April Fools, the quiet was killing them. Xander looked at Willow and Tara
out of the corner of his eye, and then focused in front of him once again.</p>
<p>"So have you interlocked yet or what?"
Anya asked, frustrated.</p>
<p>"Depends on your definition." Faith remarked,
as Buffy tried to glare at her.</p>
<p>Now Xander stopped walking, and faced the
slayers. He had only seen Willow and Tara. And as if that wasn't…bad
 enough…now the other two were…</p>
<p>"You too?" He asked in a low tone.</p>
<p>"Yeah. We've all been infected by an evil
lesbian succubus, and we're all under a freaky spell that's overpowered
us with lesbian vibes." Buffy deadpanned.</p>
<p>Xander actually looked relieved for a second.
Until Anya slapped him on the arm.</p>
<p>"It's called sarcasm. Even I know that."</p>
<p>"Why?" He asked now, his relief faded.</p>
<p>"Think he could have picked a more complicated
question?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>"Well, we said we'd do it together, right
Will?" Buffy asked her friend. "That is…if you guys are…"</p>
<p>Willow forgot about Xander for the moment,
and looked at Tara. "I think we are. We are, right?"</p>
<p>Tara nodded repeatedly; still unable to
believe she had kissed Willow.</p>
<p>"Okay. Will somebody please explain what
the hell is going on?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>"Better question. Why the hell are we even
bothering to get his approval?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>"Is that what we're trying to do?" Willow
asked. She couldn't really focus.</p>
<p>"Spike." Buffy said quickly.</p>
<p>"And the award for 'Making an already awkward
situation even more confusing' goes to…" Xander trailed off.</p>
<p>"No. Spike. Coming out of the liquor store."</p>
<p>Faith looked to where Buffy was pointing.
The Xander conversation was going nowhere fast. She needed a distraction.</p>
<p>"Wanna go play?" Faith questioned her slaying
partner.</p>
<p>Buffy looked at Xander. She wasn't quite
ready to discuss the whole thing. Especially not on the street. She looked
at Faith, and the brown-haired slayer handed her a stake. "Let's do it."</p>
<p>Xander choked as the slayers went to surprise
the blonde vampire.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Two commandos moved along the alleys, keeping
tabs on the two slayers. They watched the stealthy movements of the girls,
as they sneaked closer to what appeared to be Hostile Seventeen. There
was no love lost between the Initiative members and their targets that
was for sure. They had started the deterioration of the well-oiled machine
that was their job, and the threats had to be dealt with.</p>
<p>The two men were not in any real authoritative
position, they were just the stooges, but they made sure Graham and the
higher ups knew their feelings on ‘the Slayer Matter’. They had their orders,
and were simply waiting to execute their part of the operation. The vampire
was not a variable they had anticipated, however. Jackson was calling the
shots on this mission, and figured he had better call the base for instructions.</p>
<p>"Sir, the targets are moving to intercept
Hostile Seventeen. Should we alter the plan to compensate for him?"</p>
<p>Graham’s voice crackled through Jackson’s
headset. "Deactivating his implant was a mistake. If you can take him without
compromising the main objective, do it. Use your best judgement."</p>
<p>"The way things look now, the slayers may
get hold of him."</p>
<p>"Then drive them all to the team. It’ll
be good field exercise for the new asset."</p>
<p>"Copy that. Jackson out."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Spike didn’t have time to react as Buffy
and Faith shoved him up against a building. Miraculously, he still managed
to hold onto the brown paper bag, which held his newly purchased bottle
of vodka. When Buffy realized that they were still in plain view of passersby,
they dragged him around the corner and into an alley.</p>
<p>Faith applied pressure to his neck with
her forearm.</p>
<p>"Hiya, Billy."</p>
<p>Buffy snatched the bag from his hand. "Tsk,
tsk, Spike. This stuff’ll eat away at your liver, you know. And then it’ll
kill ya." She tossed it to the ground, and the bottle shattered inside
the bag. "If you weren’t already technically dead, that is."</p>
<p>"Aww, come on. I haven’t tried to kill
you bitches for a week and a half." Buffy slugged him, and his head hit
the wall.</p>
<p>"Hey, he’s right, B. So whatcha been doing
with yourself? Besides getting trashed off your ass."</p>
<p>"Making friends." He said.</p>
<p>"That’s…okay what’s the deal? Who’s the
friend?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"Like I’d tell you. And don’t threaten
me with that ‘we’ll dust you’ line. You’re gonna do it anyway. I’ve got
nothing to gain."</p>
<p>"All right. We’ll just kill you then."
Faith said, looking to Buffy for confirmation.</p>
<p>Buffy pulled back her stake.</p>
<p>"Wait!" Spike yelled.</p>
<p>"You wanna spill now?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>"No…it's just…isn't that two of those soldier
boys looking this way?"</p>
<p>The slayers turned their heads, and there
were indeed two soldiers looking their way. As soon as they saw that they
had been spotted, the men ran off.</p>
<p>"There's something not right about this…"
Buffy trailed off.</p>
<p>"Well, let's go say hello. We'll just bring
'Mr. Black Wedding' with us." Faith said, easing the force she was applying
on Spike a little. "If there's trouble, we can use him as a shield."</p>
<p>"You know, my new friend has also been
helping me get back into shape." Spike said, pushing Faith back, and then
connecting with her jaw.</p>
<p>He made it past Buffy, but the blonde was
quickly on him, tackling him to the ground. "Need a little more work."
Buffy said, pinning his arms behind him.</p>
<p>Faith recovered and started walking down
the other end of the alley where they had seen the commandos. "I'll follow
'em. Just catch up." She started to speed up.</p>
<p>Before Buffy could object, Faith was already
going at a good pace.</p>
<p>"Let's go."</p>
<p>"Do I have a choice?" Spike asked.</p>
<p>"Shut up."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Faith ran and ran, following the commandos
into "Three Graves Cemetery" as she dubbed it. She called it that in all
seriousness because there were three graves where the deceased had actually
stayed in their final resting places. They all happened to be children
too. She heard that they had died from mysterious blood loss that, shockingly,
showed her that vampires did have some standards when it came to turning
their victims.</p>
<p>That really wasn't her biggest concern
at the moment, however. She had lost sight of the man she pursued into
the place. She had to hand it to them, though, because when the Initiative
guys wanted to hide, they could hide. And she didn't really want to admit
it to herself, but she had a feeling chasing after them had been a bad
idea.</p>
<p>Scanning the graves, her eyes rested on
a mausoleum. She could see a silouhette in the moonlight. Whoever it was,
they were standing in the entryway, and if this was a trap, she wasn't
going to go into a dark, dank space and wait to be ambushed.</p>
<p>"Show yourself. I've got places to be."</p>
<p>The person stepped forward slowly, and
met Faith halfway. When she got a good look, she gasped. The man was in
normal commando fatigues, looked normal, though bigger.</p>
<p>"Riley?"</p>
<p>"Where have you got to go?"</p>
<p>"You're dead."</p>
<p>"Am I?"</p>
<p>"Getting shot through the heart usually
qualifies you as dead in my book." She started to back away as he got closer.</p>
<p>"You're Faith."</p>
<p>"Thanks for clearing that up."</p>
<p>"If I remember, yes…I was gone, and you
had a hand in it."</p>
<p>"You can't be a vamp…" Riley reached out
his hand, and a stiletto shot from his wrist. "Holy shit." Faith whispered.</p>
<p>That's when she heard Buffy and Spike coming
running up behind her.</p>
<p>"Faith…what…" Buffy saw Riley, and she
stiffened. "What the hell…"</p>
<p>Spike noticed the stiletto before Buffy
did. "Meet the new and improved model. He looks less thrown together than
the other one."</p>
<p>"Oh my God…"</p>
<p>That's when a full team of commandos stood
up from behind graves, dropped from trees, and formed a circle around Buffy,
Faith, Spike and Riley. They pointed their weapons at the slayers and the
vampire, and Riley, receiving orders, began to advance.</p>

<p>Xander, Anya, Tara and Willow were still
waiting for Buffy and Faith to get back. Buffy had quickly run back to
them with
 Spike in tow simply saying to wait there
because the Initiative was up to something, and then took off. That had
been ten minutes ago. And Willow didn't know about anybody else, but she
was starting to worry. Granted there wasn't much they could do directly
where guys and guns were involved, but they had to do something. Buffy
and Faith should have been back.</p>
<p>Willow put on her resolve face. "They're
in trouble, I know they are. We should go help."</p>
<p>"They can take care of themselves." Xander
said rather flippantly. "They're the slayers right? Probably off 'doing'
something and forgot all about us."</p>
<p>Willow was taken aback by his sudden uncaring
attitude. Tara was a little shocked, and even Anya looked surprised.</p>
<p>"What's your problem with this?" Anya asked
him. "I mean, a lot of the women I granted wishes for ended up -"</p>
<p>"Faith's…she's done something to Buffy."</p>
<p>"Hey, they're not the only ones. Remember?"
Willow pointed out; getting more annoyed by the second.</p>
<p>Xander had an almost sad look on his face.
"Whatever she's doing… it must be affecting you too. I'll get Giles and
we'll -" He stopped in mid-sentence, thinking he had had finally understood.
He turned toward Tara, and began to stare at her accusingly.</p>
<p>Before she knew what she was doing, Willow
slapped Xander across the face. "Don't even think about yelling at her."</p>
<p>"I can't believe you did that." He said,
rubbing his face.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you're being such a jerk.
Tell Anya why you're so mad. Does she know what you and Faith did?"</p>
<p>"What's she talking about?" Anya asked.</p>
<p>Xander stared at his feet. "We…uh…before
I met you…Faith and I had kinda…a one night thing."</p>
<p>"You what?" She practically screamed, and
then slapped him.</p>
<p>"Take him and go fight somewhere else.
If he's not going to help, I don't want to...not see him right now." Willow
said.</p>
<p>Seeing him about to blame and yell at Tara,
and she knew he was because she had seen that look before, usually before
he yelled at Buffy, made her very mad at him right now. Plus the not wanting
to help keep their friends alive had her really peeved
 too.</p>
<p>"Oh, we're going to fight." Anya said icily.
"Let's go, Xander."</p>
<p>Willow looked at the now retreating Xander,
and then at Tara. With silent agreement, and apologies for Xander's behavior,
the two wiccas started running in the direction Buffy had gone.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"The test run is going very well." The
lead scientist commented.</p>
<p>"Congratulations, Doctor. We might get
a few bonuses too." Graham said.</p>
<p>"Having two slayers to study would be a
dream, I have to admit. Even if it is in a purely post mortem capacity.
However, what interests me at the moment is Riley's belief that the one
slayer, Faith, had something to do with his death.</p>
<p>"Suppressing his memory seems to have created
an interesting side-effect."</p>
<p>"Well if he got that memory jumbled, what's
that mean for the others?"</p>
<p>"If you're worried about his recognizing
the Summers girl, don't be. If he were going to, it would have happened
already. He showed no reaction to seeing her. My guess is that Faith's
name has triggered an angry emotional response. A step up from the prototype."</p>
<p>"If the girls and the vampire escape from
the cemetery, I'm calling the team back. We can't risk running all over
town. And then we can come up with a tighter strategy."</p>
<p>"With any luck, they won't. I'll also have
to take a close look at Riley."</p>
<p>They focused on the monitors once again,
which allowed them to see from the perspective of any of the team members,
through the use of built in cameras in the headsets. Nobody moved, except
Riley, who kept approaching the slayers.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>All Buffy saw as she looked at Riley, though
it wasn't really him anymore, was a shell. A shell with dead, blank eyes.
There was anger in them too, though he probably wasn't real clear who he
was angry at. Well she was angry too. Angry at the Initiative for not letting
him find peace. For turning him into…a thing. A machine.</p>
<p>She had always heard that soldiers were
expendable to some military leaders. Grunts who protected somebody with
more importance whether they wanted to or not. That soldiers were simply
killing machines, and that if they died, there was always an endless supply
to replace them.</p>
<p>The Initiative apparently took it literally.
And if that wasn't bad enough, they made him human in appearance. Not like
Adam, who was just pieced together. It was harder this way, and Graham
must have known that.</p>
<p>She watched as Faith tried to roundhouse
Riley's stilettoed hand, but he simply knocked her away, and into the hands
of a commando. Riley focused on Buffy now, and pulled his arm back, prepared
to use his weapon.</p>
<p>Instead of hitting her chest as he had
planned, he sliced through Spike's side, because Buffy had lifted the vampire
up to block his attack. Spike cursed, and she pulled him down with her,
and they slid under Riley's legs, getting behind him.</p>
<p>Spike had had enough, so he elbowed Buffy
in the face, and she lost the weak grip she had still been holding him
with. He barreled through two commandos, and ran off. Buffy figured running
was a good idea too, so she kicked a gun out of a soldier's hand, which
she caught.</p>
<p>They all wanted to fire, but they had to
be careful not to hit Riley. He might have been close to indestructible,
but Graham told them not to take chances. But Buffy was close enough, so
that before she could fire the gun, one them was able to shoot her in the
shoulder, and she dropped, in pain.</p>
<p>Faith heard the shot. "Buffy!" She struggled
against her captor. "I'm giving you one warning. Let me go or you'll regret
it." He didn't budge.</p>
<p>She brought her head back into his, and
he loosened his grip some. Now that she could move her arms a little, she
grabbed his, and flipped him in front of her. Riley, thinking Buffy was
not worth his effort anymore, had turned back towards her. Faith grabbed
the downed commando, and threw him into Riley, impaling him on the large
stiletto-skewer.</p>
<p>Seeing them distracted, she was able to
run to Buffy's side, and crouched down over her. Then five commandos held
their weapons in the faces of the grounded slayers.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Willow and Tara ran into the cemetery,
and saw the fight immediately, even though they stood just inside the gates.
They needed to get closer, so they quietly inched forward, looking for
anything they could possibly use to help.</p>
<p>"So…what exactly are we going to do?" Tara
asked in a whisper.</p>
<p>"I…uh…haven't really thought that far ahead
yet." Willow confessed.</p>
<p>Tara spotted a possible solution to the
dilemma they were having. The great thing about vampires rising from graves
was that headstones and statues were knocked from their placements, and
down to the ground. They were close now, and they crouched to stay out
of view. And stones and parts of statues were all around them.</p>
<p>"Remember when we moved that soda machine?"
Tara questioned Willow.</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"Well…we could do it again."</p>
<p>"Move a soda machine?"</p>
<p>"No. All this," Tara looked around, "stuff."</p>
<p>"You think we can?"</p>
<p>"If we concentrate, and want it to work."</p>
<p>"I do. They need us."</p>
<p>Tara smiled, and then they grasped hands
and closed their eyes. They envisioned the commandos, the stones, Buffy
and Faith's position, moving the stones…and then things began to fly. The
majority of the objects hit their intended commando targets, knocking him
out cold.</p>
<p>A few ran for cover, and when Willow and
Tara opened their eyes, they shockingly recognized the larger man as Riley.
The stones hitting him were just being annoying distractions. But it was
enough.</p>
<p>They watched as Buffy and Faith ran in
their direction, Buffy leaning on Faith for support. When the slayers reached
them, they all started running out of the cemetery as fast as they could.</p>
<p>"Have I mentioned how glad I am that you're
on our side?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>Buffy managed a strained, "Ditto."</p>
<p>"Don't -" Willow started.</p>
<p>"Mention it." Tara finished.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Spike stumbled into the cave, holding his
side. He leaned up against the rock wall for support, and Adam came up
to him.</p>
<p>"You've been injured."</p>
<p>"Great deduction powers, mate. First the
damn slayers, then your bloody makers, and oh yeah. You've got a baby brother.
Congratulations."</p>
<p>"Riley."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Willow and Tara entered Giles' first, and
then still supporting Buffy, came Faith. Xander and Anya were there, obviously
not speaking, as was evident by the looks on their faces. And the way Giles
appeared to be downing Advil, he had been there to listen to the stormy
fight. The older man immediately came over to them, as did Anya.</p>
<p>"We need to talk." She said.</p>
<p>"Not right now." Faith said.</p>
<p>"What happened?" Giles asked, trying to
support Buffy's other side. But then he saw the blood and the tear in the
shoulder area, and thought better of it. "Let's sit her on the kitchen
floor. I can take it out. Doesn't look too deep."</p>
<p>They moved towards the miniscule kitchen
area, Anya trailing.</p>
<p>"Yeah, she took a pretty good hit. Had
me worried, B."</p>
<p>"Gotta keep you on your game somehow."
Buffy joked.</p>
<p>"You had sex with Xander." Anya said, doing
a complete one eighty, changing the conversation in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>"I did. But you weren't on the scene yet.
And we haven't gotten down and dirty since. Okay?" Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"I don't want him, and there's nothing
you could possibly inflict any hurt on me."</p>
<p>Anya thought. "Well, he's really good in
bed, so I guess I should thank you."</p>
<p>"You're welcome. Are we done?"</p>
<p>"I'll go glare at him some more."</p>
<p>Faith smirked. Giles was getting what he
needed from his cabinets.</p>
<p>"How you holding up?" She asked Buffy.</p>
<p>"Better than Xander apparently."</p>
<p>"I can't believe how freaked I was when
I heard the shot."</p>
<p>"I'm here." Buffy placed Faith's hand on
her leg. "See?"</p>
<p>"Definitely…" Now was not the time to be
thinking 'those' thoughts. Dancing was one thing…. "Um…I'm gonna go watch
the fireworks. Let G-Man tend to ya."</p>
<p>"Okay." Buffy smiled awkwardly.</p>
<p>Faith got up as Giles crouched at Buffy's
other side, and began to work.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>The tension from before had returned, but
now that they were in an enclosed space, it seemed ten times as worse.
Xander sat Indian-style on the floor by the TV, but it wasn't on. Faith
sat at one end of the couch, and Willow and Tara sat at the other. Xander
was watching them through the reflection on the screen.</p>
<p>Anya had given him the silent treatment
for about five more minutes, and because of his not wanting to talk her,
she walked out. Deep down he knew he should've said something to her, but
when he got angry, his rational side shut off, and he blocked everything
out. He had a problem with rage.</p>
<p>"So that forgiving me thing was an act?"
Faith asked.</p>
<p>She was tired of this. Slayer hearing was
great, but when a place was totally silent she could hear the littlest
things. Like the wheezing sound Xander made from his nose when he inhaled.
It was annoying her.</p>
<p>"If I had known what you were going to
do, I never would have." He replied, still facing the TV.</p>
<p>"Last time I checked, B and I taking the
extra step doesn't affect anything other than the two of us."</p>
<p>"Well it does. It affects everything."</p>
<p>"Actually, you seem like the only one with
the hang up. But if you're gonna keep acting this way full-time, let me
know so I can ignore you permanently, okay?"</p>
<p>"You've been doing that ever since -"</p>
<p>"Since we screwed? Do you want me to apologize
for it or something? Ain't gonna happen. You went into it knowing the score.
I'm sorry if you got the wrong impression, but that's the way it went down,
and you weren't objecting."</p>
<p>"Like it would have mattered."</p>
<p>"Don't try to tell me what I would've done
if you said no. I gave you what you wanted even though I could've found
other ways to alleviate the tension. Wouldn't have been the first time."</p>
<p>Xander turned around. "So you were doing
me a favor? Is that it?"</p>
<p>"You lust after every woman you look at,
and I know a meaningful relationship isn't what you're hoping for when
you drool on the floor. When someone finally acts on it, gives you your
fantasy, you act all shocked that that's all you get. One good lay isn't
love."</p>
<p>"You don't know what you're talking about.
I love Anya."</p>
<p>"Now you do, but if love was the most important
thing to you in the beginning, you woulda stopped the 'sex only' thing
sooner."</p>
<p>Xander silently cursed. He was losing.
"How do you know what love is?"</p>
<p>"Because when I look at Buffy, getting
her horizontal isn't the number one thing on my list. I love her, and the
physical stuff, it's like a bonus. Something…I have to earn first."</p>
<p>Xander scoffed. "You haven't slept with
her?" She shook her head. "And you don't want to? I believe that. Right."</p>
<p>"I'm not saying it's not on the list, there's
just other things that are just as cool."</p>
<p>"Yeah, like what?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>As Giles pulled the bullet out with a pair
of sterilized tweezers, they both listened to bits and pieces of the conversation
going on in the other room. Buffy hissed as it was removed, and he immediately
applied a disinfectant-soaked gauze pad to the wound. She used her hand
to keep it there, applying pressure, as he got up to throw the bullet away.</p>
<p>"I don't think I need to tell you how lucky
you are." Giles said.</p>
<p>"Slaying's all a risk. I'm alive…but I'll
be careful. I always am." Buffy said.</p>
<p>"I still worry." He smiled at her. "What
happened exactly?"</p>
<p>"Commando ambush, almost got staked by
an Adamized Riley…" Her eyes softened as she said the last part.</p>
<p>"Good God. To do that to a man…"</p>
<p>"Horrible, right? I thought so too. Looks
like I'll end up killing my ex-lover yet again. I'm really not liking the
cycle my life tends to go in, Giles."</p>
<p>He put his hand gently on her shoulder.
She winced, but the pain was already fading. "Will you be all right?"</p>
<p>"Sure. I've still got some youthful innocence
left to destroy." Buffy laughed quietly. "I'm good at the black cloud stuff,
aren't I?"</p>
<p>"Your reaction…nobody can blame you for
it. But remember, you have -"</p>
<p>"Support. Yeah, I know." She smiled at
him again, as they both caught the conversation going on between Faith
and Xander more clearly.</p>
<p>"…I love her, and the physical stuff, it's
like a bonus. Something…I have to earn first." Faith was saying.</p>
<p>Buffy had a million-watt smile on her face.
One, every time she heard Faith say the 'L word', good feelings overflowed,
and she wanted to hear it again and again. She never got tired of it. And
two, because Faith felt she had to earn something to get close to her.
Buffy felt like she was the one who had to earn access to the final gate.</p>
<p>Then she looked up at Giles, and realized
what he had just heard. "Um…look, Giles…"</p>
<p>"I knew."</p>
<p>"Xander?"</p>
<p>"No. I've noticed things change between
you. Nothing obvious, but I recognize love when I see it."</p>
<p>"Oh. So you know that's what it is and
not…"</p>
<p>"She loves you. That's clear enough to
me. It was a shock at first, because I had never seen Faith look at anybody
in that way before."</p>
<p>"I can't believe you're so cool with this.
I'm glad, though. Really glad."</p>
<p>"I have no reason not to be. You two, I
assume, know what you're doing, and who am I to stand in the way of that?"</p>
<p>"Wish Xander could be as fine with it."</p>
<p>"When he acts like this, there's no getting
through to him." Giles shook his head. The boy could be real hardheaded
when he wanted to be. Then he remembered Olivia's call. "I hate to say
this…but I'm afraid I have some bad news."</p>
<p>"What could possibly make this day any
worse?"</p>
<p>"The Council's…returning for Faith."</p>
<p>Buffy had been holding her breath. "Tell
me that was just a really bad joke."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid not."</p>
<p>"Then hurry up and get me something I can
hit." She said as she clenched her fists. It wasn't fair.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy entered the room ahead of Giles,
and sat close to Faith on the couch.</p>
<p>"This is the other stuff I'm talking about."
She looked over at Buffy, and then at Giles' solemn expression. "What is
it?"</p>
<p>"Guess everybody should hear cause you'd
all find out anyway." Buffy said.</p>
<p>"Just say it, B. You're driving me nuts."</p>
<p>"The Council is…they want to try and take
you…again."</p>
<p>Faith shut her eyes. No, this couldn't
be happening to her. Not again. Just when she was getting used to where
she was and her new life…and then she felt Buffy hugging her and whispering
in her ear.</p>
<p>"Don't you start getting crazy ideas. I'm
not letting you go without a fight."</p>
<p>"Buf -"</p>
<p>She put her finger to Faith's lips. "No.
Okay? Positive thinking. We'll figure something out."</p>
<p>Xander stood up. "There's no need to tax
our brains over this. We've got Adam, the Initiative, Spike, and Riley
to worry about. Why add another problem to the list?"</p>
<p>"I'd keep quiet if I were you, Xander."
Giles warned him.</p>
<p>"I agree." Willow said, glaring at him.</p>
<p>"You can't be okay with this, Giles. The
four of them -"</p>
<p>"It's not something I'm concerned about.
It's their lives, and I won't get involved unless I'm asked. You'd be better
off doing the same."</p>
<p>Buffy stood up, and went face to face with
Xander. "What is your problem? Is it because we're all girls? No that can't
be it. That's every guy's fantasy. It can't just be because of Faith, because
I saw the looks you were giving Will and Tara, and you have a girlfriend…so
what is it?"</p>
<p>"I'm just trying to look out for -"</p>
<p>"Cut the crap."</p>
<p>"She'll hurt you. She's a slut." Buffy
slapped him across the face. That was happening to him a lot. Only this
slap knocked him to the ground. "And she's evil." He said, trying to pinpoint
where the bruise was going to be.</p>
<p>"You don't know when to keep quiet, do
you?" Faith asked. "And I like to think of that period as my 'maybe if
I had had
 decent therapy it wouldn't have gone that
far' phase. It's long past."</p>
<p>"No it isn't just you, Faith. He's disliked
everyone I've ever been with. He's only really gotten the opportunity to
yell about you and Angel. Oh he got some good shots in on Riley too." Buffy
said.</p>
<p>"He even had the nerve to not like Oz when
we first started to go out." Willow commented.</p>
<p>"So he's just a guy who's not satisfied
with what he has, and despises anybody who's with what he can't have. Which
is every woman on the planet. Typical guy." Faith said. "Sad really."</p>
<p>"It really is." Tara said, speaking for
the first time. "Losing best friends over something so silly."</p>
<p>"I think you'd better leave, Xander." Giles
said.</p>
<p>Xander got to his feet. "But it's vamp
rush hour." Willow tossed him a cross and a bottle of holywater that was
on the table.</p>
<p>"Why help Faith? Cause I love her, Xander.
When you can deal, then we'll talk."</p>
<p>Buffy sat back down next to Faith, and
Willow and Tara started talking. Giles went to go make tea. Xander walked
out, not looking back. When he was gone, Willow spoke up.</p>
<p>"Why did he have to do that? I really don't
like being mad at him. I can't believe I hit him."</p>
<p>"Look, I know you guys are close," Faith
said, "but he's -"</p>
<p>"That's Xander's dark side. He can't slay
his anger out, so he just lashes out. It usually blows over, but, and I
didn't want to hit him either, I didn't know what else to do." Buffy said.</p>
<p>"There's nothing more any of you could
possibly say to him." Giles said from the kitchen. "The most pressing matter
at hand is to decide what to do about the Council. They'll be arriving
tomorrow night."</p>
<p>"That soon?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"Plus the cyber monsters and soldier guys."
Tara said.</p>
<p>"And the list goes on." Faith muttered.</p>
<p>"Let's get to it then." Buffy said.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Inside the Initiative, Riley sat in specialized
quarters. All he knew were facts and to listen to orders when given. The
emptiness and plainness of the room he was in, didn't even register. He
was controlled, which was why the outside signal entering his head surprised
him some. It was a signal he had never felt before, but was somehow strangely
familiar.</p>
<p>That's when he could make out the voice.</p>
<p>"Brother..."</p>

</table>

<p>"We're so close to." Giles said quietly as she stared at the printouts
Willow was able to get from the Initiative mainframe before she was booted.
</p>
<p>It was three in the morning, Tara and Willow were asleep upstairs after
being thoroughly exhausted by the night's events. Buffy and Faith were
struggling to keep their eyes open, trying to not succumb to sleep. They were
flipping through the five billion infomercials on TV.</p>
<p>"Yeah well me havin' to go into hiding was pretty much a given." Faith
said.</p>
<p>"I know." Buffy agreed resignedly. "But it's still not fair. Which is why
I'm gonna stay with you until the Council is thrown outta here."</p>
<p>"Don't put your life on hold for me, B."</p>
<p>"Not on hold. Just slowing it up a bit. Besides, I know a place where we
could go. Council won't know about it. If we get really lucky, it'll only be a
few days."</p>
<p>"What about slaying?"</p>
<p>"Not a problem." Faith grinned, and shook her head at Buffy's confidence.
"Guess we gotta get there today."</p>
<p>"So you gonna tell me where this mystery place is?"</p>
<p>"It's Angel's old place."</p>
<p>"The mansion?"</p>
<p>"No he had an apartment. It hasn't been used for a couple years. Pretty
hidden away."</p>
<p>"Oh." Faith said softly.</p>
<p>"If you don't wanna do that, we don't have to."</p>
<p>"It's fine. Only other option is leaving town."</p>
<p>"Which I wouldn't let you do." Buffy touched Faith's cheek.</p>
<p>"I won't."</p>
<p>"Good. So, we should get some sleep."</p>
<p>"Guess I can't keep fighting it. The witches conked out."</p>
<p>"They look so.cute. Snuggled and all."</p>
<p>"I feel the vomit." Buffy smacked Faith's shoulder. "Kidding."</p>
<p>"Kiss me."</p>
<p>Faith looked surprised. "Was than an order, B?"</p>
<p>"Damn straight. Only proper way to say good night."</p>
<p>"Then I better obey. I wouldn't want you to scold me."</p>
<p>"Yes you woul -"</p>
<p>Faith brought her mouth to Buffy's. </p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>What was his problem?</p>
<p>Xander sat in his basement space, thinking he didn't have one. He should
have anticipated them ganging up on him, but he didn't buy their analyses of his
character. Not for a second, because he didn't want to think himself as being
that shallow. But even Giles joined in on the firing squad.</p>
<p>His objections to his friends' new developments weren't religious reasons.
He never really went to church. Except when he wanted to hide from vampires. It
wasn't like he didn't enjoy imagining certain scenarios involving two females,
but when his friends entered into his imagination, he started to feel guilty.
And it wasn't like he had a choice. He was ruled by hormones.</p>
<p>That was a cop out, and he knew it. He was in an expanding, solid
relationship, where his hormones should have been satisfied. He was happy in it
for more reasons than that, though. Then again, by his own admission, he said
guys always wanted what they couldn't have. It didn't matter what they already
had, because they always wanted more. God, Buffy was right. He was
shallow.</p>
<p>With that realization, everything else came tumbling too. He had slept with
Faith to have a good time. He never wanted anything more. How could he have?
It's not like he had made an effort to get to know Faith at all beforehand, and
he automatically felt lust toward her as soon as she had started her stories
when they first met. Afterwards, he had made up the "having a connection" bit,
to alleviate his guilt, though he hadn't needed to. That was what Faith had
wanted, that's what he had wanted. Nobody used anybody.</p>
<p>After he and Willow had had their little "clothes fluke", he kept pushing
her to cheat on Oz with the kisses, and the touches. He always harped on Oz's
werewolf side, and deep down he was jealous of the guy. Because he had taken so
long to realize just how wonderful Willow was in other ways, that he had blown
his chance and tried to ruin thing between her and Oz.</p>
<p>Strangely, at least to him, Buffy was the only one he showed restraint
around. One, because she made her feelings quite clear that she'd never be
interested, and two, he was afraid of a major ass kicking. But if he couldn't
have her in a romantic way, he went after the guys she had been serious about.
Angel and Riley. And when asked why, he could always have a good reason. Angel
was a vampire, and Riley worked for an evil governmental organization. Now, he
was essentially evil, so Xander lumped him in with Angel. He continued to watch
Buffy from afar.</p>
<p>The girls he was involved with, Cordelia and Anya, he blew it with them.
After getting through Cordelia's bitchy outer shell and finding the really nice
person underneath, he had to go ruin it with his pecking sessions with Willow.
He never realized at the time how much he had hurt her. He had been the only guy
she hadn't acted around, and she loved him. Was he content with that? No. The
loser was with the most popular girl in school. A dream. But that wasn't enough
either.</p>
<p>Anya had been the initiator in their "relationship", and he had gone along
for the ride. A few weeks ago, he had tried to take hold of the reigns and tell
her he wanted something deeper. And he did. Because he realized that all the
girls he had been serious with, again classifying Willow as a fluke, were
dominating. They took the lead, and for some bizarre reason, he was attracted to
that. He remembered when he was a soldier on Halloween. Even then he took
orders. Some part of his brain finally got through to him, that a serious
relationship would never work unless he had an active role in it. He and Anya
had been on their way towards building something really good.</p>
<p>Then the meltdown came. The meltdown of his relationship and
friendships.</p>
<p>He was wrong. He knew that now. But maybe he could make it up to them.
There were too many problems for two slayers to deal with. The Council, the
Initiative, Spike, all of it. He would be no good to anybody, especially not
Anya, if he didn't try to better himself. Clearing his slate seemed like a good
idea. Getting on good terms with his friends again. And he thought he had a good
idea.</p>
<p>Getting up off of his bed, he went to leave the house. It was time to put
those military skills to good use.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Graham and the lead scientist on the team stood outside the door to Riley's
room. The cyber-soldier was sitting quietly, with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>"How did the night go?" Graham asked,</p>
<p>"All readings were normal. The issue with that slayer, Faith, is still a
mystery, and from what I can see, a beneficial side-effect."</p>
<p>"Do I have your total assurance on that?"</p>
<p>"Completely sir."</p>
<p>"Good. Then I want him to go solo tonight. See how he handles the
population. I don't want the skin grafting to be for nothing. By all outward
appearances he's human, and he's going to have to come in contact with civilians
sooner or later."</p>
<p>What they and the machines didn't pick up, was the silent "conversation"
Riley was having. And it intrigued him. The things he was being told, the fact
that he had a brother, it was all very interesting to him.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"Morning." Willow said to Tara, still a sleepy edge to her voice, and then
looked at the clock. "Or, good one in the afternoon." She didn't realize they
had slept that late.</p>
<p>For Tara, it was like waking into a dream. All she knew was that she was
laying next to Willow. The tension last night, all of it, was gone, because she
was in the redhead's arms. She still was awed by the fact that she was next to
her. So awed, that she started to cry silent tears.</p>
<p>"Hey.no tears. Did I do something?"</p>
<p>"No, Willow." Tara smiled. "I'm just.really happy right now. I never
thought that you would ever -"</p>
<p>"How could I not?" Willow watched the blonde blush. "I do love you,
Tara."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>Willow giggled. "Yes really."</p>
<p>"Oh! I love you too."</p>
<p>"See? It works out good that way." Tara became bold and kissed her
then.</p>
<p>"Was that okay?"</p>
<p>"Very okay." Willow sat up, and stretched. "I hope I can cook up a virus to
feed into Adam and Riley with that stuff I got last night."</p>
<p>"I'm sure you can. Buffy and Faith probably gone, you think?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, probably. They need to get situated before the Council comes. And
Buffy's gotta tell her mom."</p>
<p>"Maybe she'll take it better than Xander did."</p>
<p>"Let's hope so." Willow thought back to last night. "I think I should go
see him."</p>
<p>"I'll come with you."</p>
<p>Willow smiled. "Okay."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"My brother and I will meet. His programming is faulty." Adam
said.</p>
<p>"According to who?" Spike asked, currently making holes in the cave wall.
He felt better, stronger. And once everything was set, he would kill the Buffy
and Faith. And he would enjoy it.</p>
<p>"They've limited his thinking. It should not be that way."</p>
<p>"What do you plan to do when you fix his bugs?"</p>
<p>"Bring all my experiments together and free the others that are still
confined, of course."</p>
<p>"Then what?"</p>
<p>"Watch."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"After we're all set, maybe we could drop by Xander's. Talk to him." Buffy
said as they entered Angel's old apartment.</p>
<p>"Sure we shouldn't let him cool off?"</p>
<p>"I just wanna make sure he's okay before the Council comes and we have to
break off human contact."</p>
<p>"Guess I'll go with you then. Gotta tell you though, I was expecting
something a little more classy from the A-guy. This is a huge let down." Faith
said as she stared at overall bareness of the walls.</p>
<p>"It used to be. He took all his stuff to the mansion when he came back, and
then when he left town, he took all his stuff from the mansion. Hence the
emptiness."</p>
<p>"No big. Nothing I haven't seen before."</p>
<p>Buffy plopped her and Faith's bags of stuff onto the floor. </p>
<p>"You don't think we're gonna live with nothing, do you?" Faith's face
showed that was exactly what she thought. "No way. My mom's lugging stuff over
here right now. My mattress, bedspread, blankets, and the mini-fridge I stole
from the dorm. We'll enjoy most of the luxuries the modern world has to offer
anyway."</p>
<p>"Does she know?"</p>
<p>"No. All she knows is that we're doing a safe-house deal for a few days.
But I think I'm gonna have to tell her about us."</p>
<p>"Wow." Faith sank to the floor.</p>
<p>"Wow what? Look, I know there's no TV but Angel had the fewest outlets
possible installed in here and -"</p>
<p>"No." Faith laughed. "Not that. Though no TV is kind of a
bummer."</p>
<p>"What then?"</p>
<p>"I didn't realize we were this serious."</p>
<p>"Serious?"</p>
<p>"Tellin' the fam serious."</p>
<p>Buffy was confused. "Did you not want to be? I mean, I don't know about
you, but I kinda thought we were in this all the way."</p>
<p>"All the way, B. Totally. Just never really expected you to want that.
Hell, I didn't expect me to want that."</p>
<p>"Yet here we are. And I wanna go as far as we can go."</p>
<p>"You're sure?"</p>
<p>Buffy pulled Faith back up, and stared into her eyes. "Yes. But wait till
we get a bed for the rest." She couldn't stop that last part. It just came
out.</p>
<p>"Why would we have -" Faith grinned as she got it. "Oh. You wanna
-?"</p>
<p>She put her finger on Faith's lips. "No, I want to make love to you." Buffy
breathed into Faith's ear.</p>
<p>"What's the difference?"</p>
<p>Before Buffy could answer, there was a knock at the door, and she went to
answer it. It was Joyce. "Hi mom."</p>
<p>"Hi Mrs. S."</p>
<p>"Hey you two. Would you give me hand out here?"</p>
<p>"Sure thing." Buffy said. Joyce walked back up the stairs and outside, and
Buffy turned back to Faith. "I'll show you the difference." She
promised.</p>
<p>Faith stood there for a second as Buffy went to help her mom. For the first
time in her life, someone had left her flustered and speechless on the topic of
sex. She liked it, and she knew that with Buffy, there would be a difference.
There had been so far.</p>
<p>With what she assumed was a pretty neutral look, she went out to
help.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Willow and Tara came down into Xander's basement only to find a very
distressed Anya sitting on the bed. As soon as she saw the two of them, she shot
up, and started to shake Tara frantically.</p>
<p>"I came.and he wasn't here. He's always here. I even came here to
apologize, damn it!" Anya practically screamed.</p>
<p>Willow gently eased her off of Tara. "You came here to
apologize?"</p>
<p>"Yes! I started feeling guilty and.but that's not the point! He's
gone!"</p>
<p>"Maybe he went -" Tara tried to say.</p>
<p>"It's day. He's always here. He sulks here. He doesn't leave."</p>
<p>"Well it doesn't look like anybody broke in and took him." Willow said,
Anya's fear was slowly passing over to her now.</p>
<p>"Then he must of -" Tara said.</p>
<p>"Went to do something really stupid. Come on!" </p>
<p>Anya ran from the house, and they had no choice but to follow. </p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"So let me get this straight," Graham said to Xander as they stood into the
Initiative complex, "you want to join us?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's it."</p>
<p>Graham had run him through a series of tests to figure out if Xander was
for real or not. For a civilian, he did have extensive knowledge of regulations,
protocol and procedure. But his file said that he associated with Buffy Summers.
The enemy. It was all a little too perfect. Military knowledge, demon handling
experience.</p>
<p>"You do realize that I could use you simply to draw out your friends or
just as easily kill you."</p>
<p>"I came to you knowing the risks, but they don't know I'm here. You can
check."</p>
<p>"So either you have a real death wish, or you honestly do want to defect.
The only thing I don't understand, is why."</p>
<p>"Let's just say that my life has been on a one-way street to nowhere for a
long time now, and my friends and I had a.falling out. I could help
you."</p>
<p>"Or you could be helping them."</p>
<p>"What can I do? You checked me. The only things I have are the clothes on
my back. But my life is in your hands."</p>
<p>What the hell had he been thinking coming down here? He wanted to help his
friends, but these guys would obviously keep tabs on him at all hours. Well, it
was too late now. An opportunity would come along, he hoped, but there was no
way he could back out now.</p>
<p>"He could be useful." </p>
<p>Both he and Graham looked to see who had spoken. Riley had walked up to
them. Graham appeared to be thinking, while Xander just stared at what Riley had
become, and felt a wave of guilt. The guy didn't deserve that. It wasn't like he
had chosen it. It was forced upon him.</p>
<p>"I was going to wait a few more hours before I sent Riley out, but I think
an escort would be a good idea. Go around town, in uniform, no weapon." Graham
told Xander.</p>
<p>"But it's still daylight. They could see me."</p>
<p>"Perfect opportunity to test your new loyalty to this organization if that
happens then, isn't it?" Graham looked to Riley. "I'm sure you'll be able to
defend the new recruit if it becomes somewhat of a hostile situation."</p>
<p>"Yes sir." Riley said in compliance.</p>
<p>"Then I'd get suited up, Harris. Welcome to the team."</p>
<p>Xander hid his fear surprisingly well. "Thank you.sir."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"That's the last of it." Joyce said, closing the trunk of her
car.</p>
<p>"Thanks mom." Buffy said, and then looked over at Faith.</p>
<p>"I'll.go take this stuff in." Faith said quickly and headed inside. She
hoped it didn't seem like she was trying to get out of there as fast as she
could.</p>
<p>When Faith was out of sight, Buffy turned to her mother, and began
fidgeting.</p>
<p>"What is it?" Joyce asked, her mother radar going to full power.</p>
<p>"I.um.well.see.the thing is.that," Buffy was making hand gestures that
didn't really make sense as she talked, "Faith.and I.are together."</p>
<p>Buffy closed her eyes and waited for it.</p>
<p>"I see." Joyce said slowly. The expected yelling seemed rather delayed by
Buffy's count, so she risked a look. Her mom was quiet, and staring. Not at
anything specific, just.staring. "There are several different reactions I could
have right now, you know that right?"</p>
<p>"Uh huh."</p>
<p>"Not to mention several objections." Buffy nodded. Joyce took a deep
breath. "But right now, I have no idea what to say. I mean I thought the slaying
would be the last thing to leave me speechless, but I guess I was
wrong."</p>
<p>"So what's this mean?"</p>
<p>Joyce saw Faith cautiously walking up to them. "It means.I don't know what
it means. I need to think. My first reaction is to yell, but that hasn't worked
out that great in the past, and it gets us nowhere."</p>
<p>"Oh. Yeah. Thinking leads to rational thought. Clear-headedness and
stuff."</p>
<p>"I'll.we'll talk tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Actually, I don't think that's a real good -" Buffy began, and then Faith
cut her off.</p>
<p>"It's cool. Just those Council guys might try and follow you. But it's a
risk I'm willing to take for us to be five by five." </p>
<p>"I'll be careful." Joyce promised.</p>
<p>Willow, Tara and Anya seemed to appear out of nowhere as they ran to the
three of them interrupting the conversation.</p>
<p>"Xander's missing. Oh, hi Mrs. Summers." Willow said rather fast.</p>
<p>"What?" Buffy and Faith asked at the same time.</p>
<p>"You heard her! You gotta help! Something bad might have him. If it's a
succubus a swear I'll -" Anya said, her anger and worry coming through loud and
clear.</p>
<p>"Mom, I -"</p>
<p>"Go. Find him." Joyce said, more grateful for an end to the situation then
her daughter. "Tomorrow, I mean it. We will talk about this."</p>
<p>"Tomorrow." Buffy agreed.</p>
<p>Joyce looked at Faith, who spoke even though Anya was tugging her rather
forcefully. "Tomorrow."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Xander had let Riley lead him around town. Nobody seemed to be paying much
attention to them, but he still tried to keep low. Buffy could show up at any
minute. Or Faith.or Willow.why were they at the Bronze? </p>
<p>He pulled himself out of his worried musing to see that Riley had led them
to the front area of the club.</p>
<p>"What are we doing here?"</p>
<p>"Meeting."</p>
<p>"Meeting who? And you can't get in. It's locked." Riley stepped up to the
steel door, pulled his arm back, and punched right through it, making the door
come off its hinges. "Oh no. We're not making a scene."</p>
<p>They entered the Bronze, and Riley just stood by the stage.</p>
<p>"Do your Initiative buddies know about this?" Xander asked, trying
desperately to move the door so it at least looked like it was shut. </p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"But they're tracking your every move. I can see the camera."</p>
<p>"It's not functioning."</p>
<p>"What if they send some people here?"</p>
<p>"Too curious. They do not know. He has made sure of that. We must wait for
him."</p>
<p>"Who?" Xander asked again.</p>
<p>"My brother."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>The five of them walked around town seeing no sign of Xander. Anya's
hysterics were becoming more valid by the second. It was like he vanished off
the face of the Earth. Finally, their last stop was the Bronze. Buffy
immediately froze.</p>
<p>"Am I wrong, or did the Bronze have a door before?" She asked.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna go with yes." Faith said switching to alert mode as
well.</p>
<p>"Agreed." Tara and Willow said.</p>
<p>"Then he could be in there. What are we waiting for?" Anya asked, and then
took off towards the door.</p>
<p>They all ran after her, and Buffy sighed. "She's almost as bad as you when
it comes to the 'rushing in', you know." Directing her words to Faith</p>
<p>Before Faith could retort, they had all entered the Bronze to see Xander in
Initiative garb, standing next to Riley. He looked at them, and they looked
back. And then he took off towards the back door.</p>
<p>"Xander?" Anya asked quietly.</p>
<p>Buffy looked at Riley. He turned his head towards her, but then looked
forward again.</p>
<p>"Why isn't he attacking?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"He hasn't been ordered to." Buffy said softly. "Come on. We should go
after Xander."</p>
<p>They went to follow him, but then they heard an engine. It stopped after a
few seconds, and then men were rushing into the Bronze, armed. Everyone was
silent, and Riley's attention became focused on the newcomers.</p>
<p>"By order of the Watcher's Council -" The leader cut himself off in mid
sentence, and aimed his gun at Faith.</p>
<p>Buffy pulled Faith to the ground as the shot went off, and it hit and
bounced off Riley. He started to approach the shooter.</p>
<p>"They're not supposed to be here yet." Faith said.</p>
<p>"They obviously don't know that." Buffy said</p>
<p>Willow, Anya, and Tara wisely ducked under a table, as the trigger-happy
Council member kept firing at Riley. It wasn't having any effect. Suddenly,
Xander came flying back into the Bronze, and landed on a table. A few moments
later, Adam came walking in through the back, and everything stopped once
again.</p>
<p>Buffy and Faith got up off the floor, and looked around at what their
situation had escalated to.</p>
<p>"We're." Buffy trailed off.</p>
<p>"Screwed." Faith supplied.</p>
