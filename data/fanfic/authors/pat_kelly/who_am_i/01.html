<p>"Who am I?" Faith asked herself sitting
in the back of the truck.</p>
<p>Everyone asked themselves that at one point
or another, but for Faith, it was not a casual, fleeting question. She
needed an answer, and she needed it then and there. She had just spent
the previous night, and the better part of a day in Buffy Summers' body.
And she had experienced things she had never thought possible.</p>
<p>She was running down the list in her head.
She had been appreciated, she had been loved, by a parent and by a boyfriend,
and she had done the right thing. And shockingly, looking back, it had
felt good. But she had to keep reminding herself that the love, the gratitude,
was not for her. It was for Buffy.</p>
<p>Looking at down at her own body now, she
was ashamed at what she had let it become. It had been wore down, used,
and it had killed. She stared at her hands in disgust. The hands that had
held weapons used for murder. And without assistance her hands had killed
through brute force.</p>
<p>It was a sickening feeling, hating your
own body. Wanting to destroy it but knowing the little voice in her head,
the one designed to keep survival a priority, would not let her. Where
had that voice been last year? When she started on the dark path that had
become her life? She let out a dry laugh.</p>
<p>It had been there. She had just convinced
it that murdering was necessary for survival. She might not have been able
to hurt herself, but that didn't mean she couldn't let anyone else do it
for her. The voice popped up again, telling her she was almost out, almost
free.</p>
<p>She knew now that the voice was corrupted.
She shut it up, and banged on the truck.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" The driver called back.</p>
<p>"Let me out."</p>
<p>"We're not out of town yet."</p>
<p>"Just stop."</p>
<p>She felt the truck slow down, and she opened
the back doors, hopping out. She shut them again, and hit them, telling
the driver to take off. As the vehicle pulled away, she walked along the
road, hoping that she might get hit accidentally. She just wanted everything
to be over.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"How could you not know?" Buffy asked Riley
eventually, after the lingering thoughts of Faith had plagued her long
enough.</p>
<p>"She…I don't know…she came on a little
strong at first…"</p>
<p>"Did she? Maybe I shouldn't have asked
for an explanation." She got up off of his bed, and faced away from him.</p>
<p>"But I told her I didn't want that. And
then…"</p>
<p>Buffy turned around to face him now, her
strong, interrogating Slayer face on. "Then what?"</p>
<p>"She was you. And I bought it."</p>
<p>"She was me? Just because she had my body
doesn't mean…come on, Riley."</p>
<p>"I'm not…what I did, there's no excuse
for. I just know what happened. And you can do whatever you want with me,
because I'd deserve it."</p>
<p>"So," Buffy couldn't believe she was asking
this, "what happened?"</p>
<p>"Details aside…"</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>"I was making love to Buffy Summers. She
didn't act like…she acted like you. Maybe it was because she knows you
so well…"</p>
<p>"She didn't do anything 'un-me' at all?"</p>
<p>"Surprised."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Surprised. She seemed surprised that someone
was…well, hindsight doesn't really help right now, does it?"</p>
<p>"I know you didn't think that it wasn't
me, and I'm sure Faith was convincing," she said 'convincing' in a harsh
tone, "but that still doesn't make it any better."</p>
<p>Riley got out of the chair, and Buffy turned
her head away from him. He cupped her cheek in his hand. "Hey. I love you.
You have to know that, right?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know."</p>
<p>He bent down and kissed her softly. "Then
punish me."</p>
<p>Buffy went wide-eyed. "Now wait a second.
Faith may go in for that, but I don't. And you're in the doghouse as it
is."</p>
<p>He laughed quietly. "I meant I'll do whatever
it takes to make it up to you. As long as you don't plan on never seeing
me again."</p>
<p>"Oh." She flushed. "Well, good. And -"</p>
<p>Then the ringing began. They both looked
toward the source of the noise, which was the phone. She pointed to it,
and he went over and picked it up.</p>
<p>"Hello?…You're sure?…Where?…No, tell them
not to engage…No, I'll check it out…Probably…Well it's not your call…Thank
you for the information, Agent."</p>
<p>Riley hung the receiver up, and closed
his eyes in frustration.</p>
<p>"What is it?" Buffy asked him.</p>
<p>"Forrest…oh you mean…it's Faith. She's
still here."</p>
<p>"She's what?"</p>
<p>"She's walking along the road just outside
of town. Patrol team spotted her about five minutes ago."</p>
<p>"I gotta go, then." Buffy said, already
making her way toward the door.</p>
<p>"Buffy I can -"</p>
<p>"Just me."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Faith continued along the road, staying
just off of the asphalt. She still couldn't work up the guts to step out
and see what happened to collide with her. The voice had surfaced again,
screaming with all its might to keep her out of harm's way. But she was
slowly beating it down.</p>
<p>Who was going to care, anyway? Buffy wasn't
going to rush in to stop her, Willow most certainly didn't care, Xander
was scared of her, and Giles, he would…he wasn't sure what he would do.
She had nothing to live for. No job, no place, no family, she had had friends
once, but she blew that chance.</p>
<p>She watched as a Sports car flew by. If
she had been run over by that, there was still a chance at living. Then
she saw a bread truck. Perfect. And just so there was no risk of the driver
seeing her and breaking before impact, she quickly walked out into the
road, effectively killing the voice, and laid down.</p>
<p>And waited.</p>
<p>And waited.</p>
<p>And wait…then she felt something pull her
up. Before she realized what was going on, she was being forced to run
back off the road. When her feet touched the grass, the force holding her
up let go, and she fell.</p>
<p>"What the hell did you think you were doing?"
Buffy's voice asked her.</p>
<p>Great. She may have killed the voice, but
it came back to life as Buffy. That's when she turned her head, and saw
that it was really Buffy standing over her.</p>
<p>"B. I never thought you'd come."</p>
<p>"What's that supposed to mean?"</p>
<p>"I never thought you'd come? Not really
a brain teaser." Buffy stood in a defensive position, waiting for Faith's
attack, but it never came. The brown-haired slayer, simply laid on her
back in the grass. "I'm glad you did, actually."</p>
<p>"You are?"</p>
<p>"It's always nice to having someone you
know around to witness your suicide. Notes are for the weak."</p>
<p>"That's what you were doing? For what possible
reason?"</p>
<p>"Heard it was in this year. You know me,
B. Always stayin' with the trends."</p>
<p>"That's…wrong." Faith let out a full-fledged
laugh now. "What? What'd I say?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. Forget it. And why do you care
what happens to me? One less problem for you and your gang to worry about."</p>
<p>Buffy finally eased herself to a sitting
position near the other girl. "Is that what you think you are?"</p>
<p>"I know what I am. And I know what I am
to you."</p>
<p>"You have no idea -"</p>
<p>"Oh I do. Changing houses gave me a whole
new perspective. The Scoobies hate me, and so do you."</p>
<p>"Okay, so maybe they have a grudge or two…and
why are we having a heart to heart?"</p>
<p>"Damned if I know. I'm just waiting for
you to kill me."</p>
<p>"God, Faith…what happened to you? And I'm
not going to kill you."</p>
<p>"I don't know who the hell I am anymore.
And you didn't have a problem getting it done last year."</p>
<p>"I wasn't trying to kill you. I was playing
by your rules. I was being what you wanted me to be. Besides, you're the
one who jumped off the roof."</p>
<p>"Potato, Pototto. And I'd never want you
to be like me. Ever."</p>
<p>"Let's get everything out. I tried to reach
out to you, but you weren't being receptive girl. But you kept pushing
and pushing for me to see your side of things. And I did. Things got out
of hand. So don't say you didn't want me to."</p>
<p>"If you're gonna get technical, then, okay,
yeah. Then. Now, if you ever, ever turned out like me…well you were me.
How was it?"</p>
<p>Buffy looked down at her hands. "I…you…got
spit on."</p>
<p>"Really? Got off easy. I tried so hard
to be me in there," she pointed to Buffy, "but I ended up being you."</p>
<p>"You were in control. You could've done
anything you wanted. And from what Riley told me, you did."</p>
<p>"That boy has it hot for you."</p>
<p>"And you enjoyed taking advantage of that,
didn't you?"</p>
<p>"I wanted to, but I couldn't."</p>
<p>"You couldn't?" Buffy half-stated and half-asked.
She didn't believe it. "He used the L word. It wasn't for me."</p>
<p>Buffy thought for a few moments, contemplating
what to do. Faith was on the verge of something, and Buffy didn't quite
get it yet. But she wanted to. And if she pushed her away now, it would've
been her last chance to reach the other slayer.</p>
<p>Buffy stood up, and reached out her hand.
"What do you say we get outta here?"</p>
<p>"And go where? Cops want me, remember?"</p>
<p>"They won't find you."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>The two witches had just returned to Tara's
room.</p>
<p>"So…you do that kind of thing a lot?" Tara
asked Willow.</p>
<p>"You mean the waiting while Buffy kills
the evil things? I used to do it a lot more, but yeah, I have experience."</p>
<p>"Have you ever been hurt?" Tara asked quickly.</p>
<p>"Once. It's a long story."</p>
<p>"You did it for her, didn't you? Whatever,
you know, happened?"</p>
<p>Willow sat on the bed. "Yeah. I…it was…I
just wanted to see her happy." She smiled. "What'd you think of her? The
real her."</p>
<p>"She was nice. I don't know if she likes
me, though."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"She's protective of you. She cares about
you."</p>
<p>"I care about her too. We're best friends.
She has to be cautious. It comes with her job. But once she gets to know
you…"</p>
<p>"It's good that she watches out for you.
I just…don't want her to hate me."</p>
<p>"She doesn't hate you. Well, unless you're
planning to hurt me. But I know you're not."</p>
<p>Tara shook her head quickly. "No! No way."</p>
<p>Willow grabbed her hand, and smiled. "You
want to go find her so she can get to know you better? She'll like you
as much as I do. I know she will."</p>
<p>"Okay." Tara said, nodding.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy led Faith into the college's empty
gymnasium. They walked over onto the mats.</p>
<p>"Hang on, I'll be right back." Buffy said.
She walked near the back of the gym and disappeared into a side room.</p>
<p>"This isn't exactly below cop radar."</p>
<p>"Please. The police in this town don't
see anything unless it's right in front of them. And even then they're
still blind." Buffy said, coming back with a punching bag. "Point is, they
aren't going to come here looking for you. They probably think you're long
gone."</p>
<p>"So what are we doing here?"</p>
<p>"Blowing off some steam," Buffy said hooking
the bag to chain that came down from the ceiling, "and we're going to work
this whole thing out."</p>
<p>"Okay it's my turn to ask this now. Why
aren't you attacking me?"</p>
<p>"Cause I don't attack somebody that isn't
attacking me. But you really wanna know why?" Faith shrugged, but she really
did want to know. "I don't want to. I never really have. You're like a
sister to me."</p>
<p>Faith tried very, very hard not to let
her jaw hang open in shock.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Giles was eating a salad, his lunch, when
Spike barged in, jacket over his head. The vampire slammed the door shut,
and stood there looking at the ex-watcher, clearly angry. Giles simply
took a bite of his salad.</p>
<p>"You too?" Spike growled. "Goddamn chip!"</p>
<p>Giles looked up finally. "Something wrong,
Spike?"</p>
<p>"Everyone's a comedian. Well I don't need
it. You here me?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly. Why are you here? Because I
seem to recall your least words to me were, 'I hate you all.'"</p>
<p>"I do. With a bloody passion."</p>
<p>"Then would you mind leaving?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I would." Spike sat on the couch
by the TV. "It's that Slayer of yours. She's pissing me off."</p>
<p>"And you expect me to care why?"</p>
<p>"She's losing her mind, and I can't take
it."</p>
<p>"Fine, I suppose I'll ask. Why exactly
is she loosing her mind?"</p>
<p>"It's not so much her mind as her morals.
Buffy the Vampire Slut."</p>
<p>"Excuse me?" Giles asked, nearly choking
on a crouton.</p>
<p>"Yeah. That's right. She was all over me.
Flaunting it."</p>
<p>"And this was when?"</p>
<p>"Last night. I just…god, if I could just
tear out her throat…only her. That's all I ask."</p>
<p>"Oh." Giles said in a relieved tone. "I
believe that was Faith."</p>
<p>"Wait." Spike said rising from the couch
and walking over to the table. "You said Faith was brow-haired," he raised
his hand just below his neck, "this tall, and criminally insane."</p>
<p>"She is, but there was a slight mix up."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Faith was punching the bag repeatedly as
Buffy held it. The brown-haired slayer was clearly angry, and she was making
the bag hurt.</p>
<p>"Talk to me. You had a chance to screw
up my life, but didn't. Why?"</p>
<p>"Because…I…couldn't. I was gonna. Destroy
your life, split. But it's meaningless. It's all meaningless."</p>
<p>"My life?"</p>
<p>"Mine." She stopped punching and was breathing
heavily. "This body screws and kills. Yours loves and saves. See the difference?"</p>
<p>"You're not your body. You're you. A body
doesn't make you who you are."</p>
<p>"What did you do to get away from the Council
guys? Did you reason with them?"</p>
<p>"I tried."</p>
<p>"But it didn't take, did it? They didn't
care what you had to say, did they? So what did you have to do? Use violence?
Threaten? Why didn't you act like you?"</p>
<p>"I know what you're driving at, okay? So
you have a rep. You can change."</p>
<p>"It's too late. My place is set. It was
cool being in your shoes. Being appreciated was...made me realize
how big I screwed up. I made the wrong choices, and I can't fix it. It’s
easy for you to say I can. You've got it better."</p>
<p>"Do you hate me?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. I did. Cause the Mayor convinced
me it was easier."</p>
<p>"Why'd you do it?"</p>
<p>"Survival, B. Appreciation. Love. He gave
it all. But you wouldn't understand."</p>
<p>"I know he loved you. I can't understand
how he could love anything, but I knew. I just wish I hadn't driven you
away."</p>
<p>"I drove myself away. If I had been in
your position, I would've gutted me too."</p>
<p>"Eight months, Faith. I lied when I said
I forgot about you. I wanted to tell you how sorry I was…"</p>
<p>"Let it lie. It's done."</p>
<p>"What's going on?"</p>
<p>They turned around and saw Willow and Tara
looking at them.</p>
<p>"Tara, right?" Buffy asked, trying to avoid
the situation that had just developed.</p>
<p>"Uh huh. Hi." The girl responded.</p>
<p>"Buffy?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>Buffy turned to look at Faith, but the
other slayer was already running off.</p>
<p>"Faith, wait!"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy caught up with her at the side door
of the gym. Faith watched the other two girls' approach slowly, and she
put her hand on the door handle.</p>
<p>"I held a knife to her throat. I don't
think we're gonna bond."</p>
<p>"Maybe…maybe not. But I'm not letting you
leave. This is one of those choice moments, and I'm trying to help you
make the right one. Let me."</p>
<p>Buffy stared at her, and Faith slowly took
her arm off the door and brought it down to her side. Willow walked up,
Tara behind her.</p>
<p>"Explain." The redhead said.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry?" Faith offered tentatively.
"To you too." She looked at Tara.</p>
<p>"What did you say to her?"</p>
<p>"It's okay." Tara said putting her hand
on Willow's shoulder.</p>
<p>"No it's not!" She's…"</p>
<p>"Telling the truth."</p>
<p>"Huh?" She looked at Tara quizzically.</p>
<p>"She is, Will." Buffy added.</p>
<p>"Look, I don't expect you to forgive me.
I'm just sorry." Faith said. "I don't know much anymore. But I do know
I'm sorry."</p>
<p>Everyone was silent. Then Tara raised her
hand. "Can I…ask you a question?"</p>
<p>"Sure." Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"What's five by five mean?"</p>
<p>They all smirked a little, and then Faith
answered her. "I'll let you figure it out. I'm not 'it' anymore. I can
tell you that."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"Well I can't speak for anyone else," Buffy
started, "but if you let me, I'd like to help get you back there."</p>
<p>Buffy, Tara and Faith stared at Willow.
The hacker/wicca couldn't handle the stares, and as much as she wanted
to, she couldn't go against her nature. "As long as it doesn't involve
sharp, metal objects, I'll help."</p>
<p>"It's gonna be hard, isn't it?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>"Probably." Buffy admitted.</p>
<p>"Fun factor?"</p>
<p>"Zero."</p>
<p>"I haven't given that lifestyle much of
a shot. I'll give it a go. Cops?"</p>
<p>"We'll handle it." Willow said, referring
to her and Tara.</p>
<p>"Ready for the first problem?" Buffy asked
Faith.</p>
<p>"Shoot."</p>
<p>"My boyfriend."</p>
<p>"Oh…right. Ah, aren't sisters supposed
to share?" Buffy had a disbelieving look. "Kidding, B. You know I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have, but…I never, felt like…"</p>
<p>"It's…a start." Buffy looked at Willow
and her friend. "You two coming?"</p>
<p>"Yeah." Willow said. "Tara?"</p>
<p>"Right behind you."</p>

<p>Faith stood in her old apartment. Her loft.
The one the Mayor had purchased for her. She was still upset that he was
dead. He had been like a father to her. Sure he was evil, but he had always
treated her well. Plus, he had this quirky, sometimes lame, sense of humor
that grew on her. And thanks to him, she was addicted to milk.</p>
<p>But, after he ascended, she knew he wasn't
the man who looked out for her. He had become a large, demon snake, whose
number one priority was eating people. She knew Buffy had to kill him,
and she was trying really hard to enforce her new self-policy. 'The past
is the past. Let it lie.'</p>
<p>She took the Mayor's taped message for
her, where he basically said she wouldn't be able to survive without him,
as a challenge. If she could make it, it would show him just how determined
she was, and maybe, just maybe, a part of him would be proud of her. No
matter who was helping her with the surviving thing.</p>
<p>The apartment was in a shambles, and obviously
hadn't been touched. The window smashed, bedspread on the floor, boxes…it
had been a nice place once. But that, this, was in her past. She walked
over to one of the boxes, and pulled out a dress. The pink dress. From
him.</p>
<p>Maybe she'd keep one thing, she thought,
hugging the article of clothing to her chest.</p>
<p>"Wanna take anything?" Buffy asked, standing
in the doorway.</p>
<p>"Not much. Too many bad -"</p>
<p>"Memories. Yeah. Did I mention how sorry
I am?"</p>
<p>Faith turned around, a small smile on her
face. "Enough so that I have to work to catch up."</p>
<p>"Hey," Buffy said reassuringly, "it's not
a contest."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know."</p>
<p>"What's that?" Buffy looked at the dress.</p>
<p>"Oh, um," Faith said folding the dress,
"it was a gift."</p>
<p>"From…oh." Buffy didn't know if she'd ever
understand the Mayor or his relationship with Faith, but she could tell
it ran deep. "So…nothing else?"</p>
<p>"Oh! I don't know if it’s still…"</p>
<p>She ran off into the other room, and Buffy
walked over to try and see what she was getting. Faith came back, a few
minutes later, carrying a bag, and a gray box-thing. That was the only
thing Buffy could think of to describe it.</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>"Come on, B. You gotta know what this is."
Buffy shook her head. "Your poor, poor slayer girl. College freshman and
you've never…" Now it was Faith who shook her head. "PlayStation."</p>
<p>"Play Station?"</p>
<p>"It plays video games? On CD?"</p>
<p>"Oh…right."</p>
<p>"We have some wicked serious gaming to
do. Dreamcast come out yet?"</p>
<p>"For some reason the date 9-9-99 keeps
popping into my head."</p>
<p>Buffy opened the door, and let Faith go
past her out of the apartment.</p>
<p>"Damn. I gotta get to the mall then."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"Do you know what you're doing?" Xander
asked Giles.</p>
<p>He and Willow were in Giles' house. After
Buffy had talked to Giles, and Willow told him what she and Tara had done,
in simple terms, a spell that made the cops "forget" who Faith was, and
cleared her file. Some would argue, and they'd be correct, that Faith was
being allowed to get away with murder.</p>
<p>But Giles wanted to help the girl. Prison
wouldn't help her; it would just make things worse. Besides, Faith probably
could escape anyhow. And she had killed under orders from the Mayor. And
he saw how charismatic, how convincing, the man was first- hand. He was
evil, but at the same time, the nicest person you'd ever meet.</p>
<p>Faith had been at a point last year, after
she accidentally staked the Deputy Mayor and Wesley had tried to take her
to England without explanation, without caring, where she was extremely
vulnerable. Very scared. And the Mayor had offered her something they couldn't.
Though they wished they could have. Especially Buffy.</p>
<p>Stability. Safety. A place in life without
having to feel second.</p>
<p>Buffy, he knew, had tried very hard to
assure Faith that she was needed. Liked. Welcome into the group. The difference
between Buffy and the Mayor was that to Faith, Buffy didn't really need
her help, her friendship, because Buffy already had that. She felt like
a pity case.</p>
<p>While the Mayor, didn't have anybody. Allan
had died, and Trick was dust. He was alone, and probably worried that his
plans for ascension were nearly ruined. He must have reached out to Faith,
Giles reasoned, and she had been drawn to it immediately. He had seen many
people like her, and he still sympathized with her.</p>
<p>If he said he still wasn't a little afraid,
it would've been a lie. But Buffy had assured him that Faith wanted to
rebuild her life and correct her mistakes. He had been reckless like her
once. Maybe that was why he was so quick to help. And as long as she was
willing, and Buffy was sure, he was willing to give her a place to stay.
That's what had Xander all wound up.</p>
<p>"I know perfectly well what I'm doing.
She can't stay with Buffy because she's not a student, Joyce is still rather
skeptical, and Faith has no means of income. I could use the company, actually."</p>
<p>"The company of a homicidal maniac? I still
don't get how you could let her off the hook, Will."</p>
<p>"She doesn't have the…'eye look' thing…anymore.
She needs help. She wants it." Willow said.</p>
<p>"Maybe that's cause she's, I don't know,
a good actress?"</p>
<p>"Look, we've all got reasons to be wary,
but um, are you sure you don't have other reasons for being apprehensive?"
Giles asked.</p>
<p>"No…I think the fact that she nearly almost
cut off circulation to my lungs is good enough."</p>
<p>"So it has nothing to do with her being
the first person you had sex with and you feeling insecure because she
kicked you out so fast?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"Thanks for boiling it down, Will. Man,
am I glad Anya's not here."</p>
<p>"I think I might have a solution." Giles
offered.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Give her a chance, and talk to her."</p>
<p>"But that makes too much sense."</p>
<p>"Oh, right. I forgot who I was talking
to."</p>
<p>"Hey!"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy and Faith had gone to the campus,
so Buffy could give her the real tour. They were heading off now, to go
to Giles'. They walked down the steps, Faith talking about her hidden passion.</p>
<p>"But there's this on move you can do, and
BAM! Guy ain't getting' up." Faith said thrusting her arm up for emphasis.
"You gotta try it."</p>
<p>"How exactly do you do it again?"</p>
<p>"You face the guy," Faith thought a moment,
"hit right twice, then square, square circle."</p>
<p>"They make it so simple. So what's with
the obsession over this stuff?"</p>
<p>"You really wanna know?"</p>
<p>"Wouldn't ask if I didn't."</p>
<p>"It was kind of an escape. Course back
when I started, all they had was Pong on Atari, but still…it gave me something
to do. It was better than…"</p>
<p>"Better than what?" Buffy urged.</p>
<p>Faith was hesitant, and before she could
get an answer out, Riley ran over, cutting them off.</p>
<p>"Buffy, can I…" He saw Faith then, and
his eyes widened, then narrowed. "Hello."</p>
<p>"Hey." She looked at Buffy, and pointed
her thumb over to the side. "I'll just…go hang."</p>
<p>"I'll be there in a sec." Buffy told her.</p>
<p>"No, it's cool. Take your time." Faith
backpedaled, leaving them alone.</p>
<p>Buffy turned to Riley, however reluctantly.
She really wanted to talk with Faith. "What's going on?"</p>
<p>"Shouldn't I be asking you that?"</p>
<p>Buffy had to think. "Faith is -"</p>
<p>"I thought you told me she was dangerous.
That she hurt you. What's the deal?"</p>
<p>"It's complicated."</p>
<p>"Explain it to me."</p>
<p>She looked back at Faith. "This is something
that I have to do alone. She isn't a threat, if that's what you're worried
about."</p>
<p>"That's not what I meant. If I've…is this
because of what -?"</p>
<p>"It has nothing to do with...we're fine."
She assured him, squeezing his hand. "She just needs my attention right
now."</p>
<p>"What changed your mind?"</p>
<p>"I got a taste of what it's like for her,
and I don't want her to have to go back to that."</p>
<p>"Then I'm sure you know what you're doing.
I hope you…help her."</p>
<p>"Me too."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>As Faith was waiting Buffy to come over,
she felt very alone. Did the Mayor know her or what? She was feeling somewhat
better about herself, but now that she was starting to build friendships
again, she was surprised how dependent she was becoming on them. And for
the first time in her life, she didn't see that as a bad thing.</p>
<p>"Faith?"</p>
<p>The slayer came out of her thoughts, and
realized Tara was standing near her trying to get her attention. "Sorry.
I was spacing. What's up?"</p>
<p>"Nothing. Are you…going to see Willow?"</p>
<p>"We're going to Giles'. She's probably
there."</p>
<p>"Oh…okay."</p>
<p>"You wanna come with or something?"</p>
<p>"I don't wanna get in the way."</p>
<p>"Hey, what I said before? Stick is good,
but I don't have a problem with people who drive automatic. Less complicated
anyway." Tara blushed just as Buffy sprinted over. "Everything five by
five?"</p>
<p>"Is that like a slaying term?" Tara asked,
still trying to figure out the meaning.</p>
<p>Buffy smiled at Faith, then displayed her
hand, her five fingers completely outstretched, to the two girls. "The
fivest. Hi Tara. And your guess is as good as mine."</p>
<p>"Hi Buffy."</p>
<p>"Looking for Will?" Tara nodded. "Come
with us."</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>"No problem. So you been hanging out long?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Xander was pacing as the door of the house
opened, and the three girls entered. Giles came out of the kitchen, and
Willow rose from the couch. She smiled wider when she saw Tara.</p>
<p>"Look who we found." Buffy said.</p>
<p>"Did you get my message?" Willow asked
Tara.</p>
<p>"Uh huh. I was just walking, and I saw
them and…"</p>
<p>"Well it's cool you came." Willow looked
at Buffy and Faith. "Did you get everything you needed?"</p>
<p>"Bare essentials. Speaking of, where's
the TV?" Faith said, carrying her bag of PlayStation supplies with her.
"Here we go. Score." She knelt down and proceeded to unpack.</p>
<p>Willow walked up to Buffy. "How is she?"</p>
<p>"Good. Still got a lot ahead of her, I
think, but she's on her way. Tara's nice. She seems to think highly of
you. Not that I blame her."</p>
<p>Willow was beaming. "So you like her?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. You should bring her around to hang
out with us more."</p>
<p>"I think she'd really like that." Willow
said, and then walked over to Tara. "You gotta see some of the books Giles
has."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy switched her attention to Xander
who was watching Faith cautiously as she tried to hook up the game machine.
Buffy walked over to him, and lightly elbowed him in the stomach. "Go be
nice."</p>
<p>Giles came over to Buffy, as Xander made
his way over to Faith.</p>
<p>"Is she all set?" He asked.</p>
<p>"As much as she's going to be. Thanks for
giving her a place."</p>
<p>"I'm happy to do it. She's thanked me several
times already."</p>
<p>"So you can see she's trying."</p>
<p>"Yes she is, and that's a big step in the
right direction. Just one question."</p>
<p>"Fire away."</p>
<p>"What exactly is she doing to my television?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Faith had the machine all ready to go,
and was searching through her game library. Xander walked up behind her,
and had not yet noticed what she was doing.</p>
<p>"How are you?" He asked. 'Did you kill
anyone today?' was his silent question.</p>
<p>"Xander, hey. I'm hanging in there."</p>
<p>"Got a girlfriend now."</p>
<p>"Yeah, that girl, right?"</p>
<p>"Anya."</p>
<p>"Very sexually active."</p>
<p>"Was that a question?"</p>
<p>She found the game she wanted and opened
the lid. "A fact."</p>
<p>"Is there a problem with that?"</p>
<p>"No, it's good exercise. Builds the muscles."</p>
<p>Xander had been beating around the bush,
and finally just blurted out his real question. "Was I…good?"</p>
<p>"Good?"</p>
<p>"Ya know, when we…"</p>
<p>"Oh…well…" She pushed the 'POWER' button
and started to plug in the controllers. "I didn't fake it."</p>
<p>"Really?" Xander asked, suddenly feeling
a lot of pride.</p>
<p>"Swear to God. Didn't I say that a lot?
Anyway, I'm sure you're making her very satisfied." With that, Faith had
reassured his manhood and apologized, and that was good enough for him.
"Wanna play?"</p>
<p>Xander had to clear his throat, and then
he looked down at what she had been doing. He suddenly devolved several
years. "You have a PlayStation? Count me in. What you got?" He asked, lowering
himself to the floor.</p>
<p>"Tekken 3's in now. Not the latest, but
still a goodie. Hey, B! Willow! Tara!"</p>
<p>Buffy came over first. "So this is it,
huh?"</p>
<p>"Time for me to teach you." Faith said.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Several hours later, they were all crowded
around the small TV, two unlikely combatants engaged in battle. Everyone
was cheering them on.</p>
<p>"Sweep the leg!" Willow said.</p>
<p>"No, jab! Jab!" Xander said.</p>
<p>"They're both wrong. Jump kick!" Buffy
said.</p>
<p>And in the next the next second the match
was over. Giles handed his controller over to Buffy, and Tara was silently
enjoying her victory.</p>
<p>"That was bracing. Certainly improves hand-eye
coordination." Giles said.</p>
<p>Xander checked his watch. "Damn, it's late.
Gotta get home before my parents change the locks."</p>
<p>"I guess I should go too." Tara said.</p>
<p>"Oh! I'll walk you." Willow said rising
up off the floor.</p>
<p>After quick good-byes, and promising to
be careful, the three of them left. Giles got up as well.</p>
<p>"I think I'll call it a night. You two
will be all right?"</p>
<p>"We're as independent as they come." Buffy
said.</p>
<p>"Ditto." Faith said.</p>
<p>"Good night, then."</p>
<p>"Giles?"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Thanks for…giving me another chance. I
know I…just…really appreciate it."</p>
<p>He smiled at her, and walked up the stairs.
Faith turned to Buffy, then, afraid to ask, but she had to. "Do you have
to split too?"</p>
<p>"No. I don't have classes tomorrow. You
want me to stay?"</p>
<p>"You don't have to. Only if you want."</p>
<p>"You want the couch or the floor?"</p>
<p>Faith smiled slightly, and fiddled with
the wire in the controller. "Um…my mom, she was a heavy drinker, and my
dad would always come home and beat…hurt her. If I kept my mouth shut,
I wouldn't get it after she did.</p>
<p>"But it was hard to just, you know, ignore.
I needed something to distract me. The Atari was the thing that saved me
most of the time. I…"</p>
<p>Buffy put her hand on Faith's back. She
felt the other slayer tense, and then relax. She didn't want to force her
to say any more, she knew it would all come out on its own eventually,
or so she hoped.</p>
<p>"Wanna start a new game?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>Faith was relieved Buffy hadn't pushed.
It hurt enough just getting that out. It was good to have someone just…listen.
"Yeah. I'm up for it."</p>

</table>

<p>A vampire flew through the air, and landed
face first on a stone bench. If he were still human, his jaw would have
been busted open. Strong hands picked him up by his shirt collar; he was
kneed in the gut, and tossed onto his back. A foot pushed down on his neck.</p>
<p>There was a second vampire. He was getting
pushed back further and further, by multiple punches being directed at
his face. He was close to his buddy now. His attacker kicked him forcefully
in the chest, and sweeped his legs. The vampire twirled and landed on top
of his friend.</p>
<p>Faith staked him, but the other one still
laid there. He raised his head up.</p>
<p>"Adam is coming. He makes us stronger."</p>
<p>Buffy bent down, holding her stake above
him. "Looks like he's still got a few bugs to work out, but we got the
message. Thanks." She plunged the stake into his heart, and his ashes settled
in the grass.</p>
<p>The two slayers high-fived.</p>
<p>"Man I missed this." Faith said, revved
up.</p>
<p>An image entered Buffy's mind. An image
from a night that still haunted her. A wave of guilt washed over her.</p>
<p>Man, I'm gonna miss this. Shoulda been
there, B. Quite a ride.</p>
<p>She quickly shook it away and smiled at
Faith.</p>
<p>"The chosen two back in action. I like
this too."</p>
<p>They began the trek out of the cemetery.</p>
<p>"So who's this Adam guy, anyway?"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't exactly call him a guy. Half
a guy, or maybe even a quarter guy. He's like a puzzle a five-year-old
puts together. None of the pieces are supposed to fit, but somehow they
do."</p>
<p>"You're not sayin' what I think you're
sayin."</p>
<p>"What do you think I'm saying? If you think
I'm saying he's a techno version of Frankenstein complete with floppy drive,
super strength, and demon parts, you'd be right."</p>
<p>"Nope. Woulda been way off. Gone up against
him?"</p>
<p>"And lost. Majorly. He is doing something
to the vamps, cause they have seemed, I dunno, less afraid."</p>
<p>"Then he's just setting 'em up to get taken
out. You and me, we'll rewire Frank the Next Generation, steal his vamp
steroid pills, and toss him in the scrap heap."</p>
<p>"I like the way you think. Guys are at
the Bronze. You got the energy?" Faith grinned at her.</p>
<p>Isn't it crazy how slaying always makes
you hungry and horny?</p>
<p>Buffy grinned back at her. "Course you
do."</p>
<p>"Long as I get food out of it, I'm in."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>The Bronze was…well, the Bronze. It was
the one thing that had stayed unchanged in the town. That, and the nightly
"mysterious" deaths. Buffy and Faith entered the club, and spotted the
gang over at a table. Riley was surprisingly also there.</p>
<p>As they approached, Willow got up off her
stool and walked over to the bar. Faith shook her head and took a deep
breath. Every time she saw Willow, if the girl could get away from her,
she did. If she had to be around her she'd act polite, and nice, but she
really didn't feel that way, and Faith knew that. She also knew the redhead's
hatred towards her was completely justified. She had thought Willow to
be her enemy, which was why she had had that daydream of shoving a blade
through the girl's stomach. She had been wrong, and completely screwed
everything up.</p>
<p>There was nothing she could say, to herself
or to Willow, to make things right. Willow was the only one out of Buffy's
circle of friends that she had truly wanted to hurt before, and that was
for two reasons. The first being that Willow was everything, every quality,
which Faith thought, she could never achieve. And the second being, that
she was the one Buffy spent the most time with. She had been the one that
Buffy needed.</p>
<p>Not Faith. Not the person in the same the
line of work.</p>
<p>Faith was just beginning to understand
that Buffy's friendship didn't have to be competed for. That the blonde
valued, or had valued, she was still unsure of her place yet, her friendship
just as much as the hacker's. She didn't hate Willow, though she had convinced
herself she had at one point, because she couldn't deal with the rage she
had inside her. She was working on it.</p>
<p>The truth of it was, she wanted Willow
as a friend too. There weren't too many people in the world that would
help you even though they despised you, and Faith could only imagine what
Willow was like when she liked you. She wanted to know.</p>
<p>"How'd the slayage go?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>"All encountered vamps extinguished." Buffy
said, going to sit on Riley's lap, and kissing him. "Hey you. Been here
long?"</p>
<p>"Long enough to be surprised at the amount
of military knowledge Xander has."</p>
<p>"Yeah, who needs years of military training?
All you have to do is buy a plastic gun from an evil magician and let him
weave his evil magic."</p>
<p>"I'll make sure to mention that to my superiors."</p>
<p>"Speaking of," Buffy said, "did you find
anything out?"</p>
<p>"Everyone's got the military code of silence
policy down to a 'T'. How about Adam?"</p>
<p>"Nope. Some of his recruits though." She
got up and reached for his hand. "Enough work. Dance with me."</p>
<p>Riley rose, and they started to walk out
to the dance floor.</p>
<p>"You kids behave." Faith said. Buffy simply
rolled her eyes at the remark. Faith turned to Xander. "Can I ask you a
question?"</p>
<p>"Sure. My schedule's wide open."</p>
<p>"Why'd you -"</p>
<p>"Forgive you so fast?"</p>
<p>"How'd you know I was gonna say that?"</p>
<p>"Cause I saw you watch Will leave, and
I figured the topic of 'forgiveness' had to be on your mind somewhere.
You know, seeing as she still…doesn't."</p>
<p>"And you became the King of Deduction,
when?"</p>
<p>"Well, when you're a jobless, non-college,
living in his parents basement type of guy like me, you tend to spend most
of your time learning to understand the human condition."</p>
<p>"I see. So…why did…you take me off your
hate list?"</p>
<p>"I'm a male."</p>
<p>"Glad you're secure in your gender type."</p>
<p>"My point, 'O Quick to Be Sarcastic One',
is that generally we're all talk. About women mainly. But when confronted
with the opposite sex, we tend to cave."</p>
<p>"So the only reason you forgave me is because
you were afraid of what I might've done to you." She stared at the table.
"I'm just kidding myself. It's my fault. Once somebody labels ya evil,
it'll always stick."</p>
<p>"Okay, so maybe the original reason was
out of fear, but I wouldn't have just said 'Hey I forgave you cause I thought
you might kill me if I didn't' if I thought you were evil."</p>
<p>"Then explain it to me."</p>
<p>He looked into her eyes. 'The look' wasn't
there anymore. Willow was right.</p>
<p>"None of us think you're evil. Willow knows,
we all know, you're sorry and want to be a good guy…gal again. But forgiveness
and believing somebody to be evil are two totally unrelated things. For
me, it was a little easier.</p>
<p>"I've got rage, I've been disliked many,
many times, and I know what it's like to feel left out. But I was in a
position where I had support to fall back on, so I wasn't tempted to take
the other extreme route."</p>
<p>"But I had all of you there, and I still
snapped."</p>
<p>"Aha, but you didn't think you did. Big
difference. And that's our fault too. By the time we tried to reach out
for you…well, a peaceful solution wasn't an option was it?"</p>
<p>All that killing and you're afraid to die?</p>
<p>"No, I was really messed up then."</p>
<p>"Course, then there was the killing…"</p>
<p>"They didn't really register. Kinda get
numb to 'em."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>'Go ahead. Say you would lay down on your
bed alone, and cry until there were no more tears left, and you sank deeper
and deeper.'</p>
<p>"I'm thirsty. Wicked hungry too."</p>
<p>'You're hopeless. How do you ever expect
to be friends with these people if you don't -'</p>
<p>"Shut up." Faith muttered to herself as
she headed to the bar.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy and Riley moved slowly on the dance
floor. He could tell she was distracted.</p>
<p>"Hey…you okay?"</p>
<p>"I'm just dandy." She laughed softly at
her own use of the bizarre word. "I've been absentee girlfriend lately,
haven't I? Sorry."</p>
<p>"We both have our own lives. But I've missed
you."</p>
<p>"Quality 'us' time soon, promise. Just
had a lot on my mind lately. The Initiative, Adam…and that is such a lame
name, you know?"</p>
<p>"Faith's in there too, right?"</p>
<p>"You caught my avoidance, huh?"</p>
<p>"She not -"</p>
<p>"No, that's just the thing. It's been great.
Slaying with her, talking, hanging…it's guilt, really."</p>
<p>"Guilt over…"</p>
<p>"What I did to her, what we did to each
other, what Xander and Willow went through…she's forgiven me, and I've
forgiven her, but I don't know if…"</p>
<p>"What? You can talk to me."</p>
<p>"But you're not exactly impartial when
it comes to her are you?"</p>
<p>"I'm trained to be."</p>
<p>"You have a recent track record of not
following the rules, remember?" He gave her a look. "But I'll try and explain."</p>
<p>"That's all I ask."</p>
<p>"I think it has something to do with us
both being slayers. Even when we fought, I didn't want to hurt her. And
the way she talks now, I know she didn't really want to either. Okay, so
maybe she was jealous, but she was just following orders."</p>
<p>Riley flinched slightly. 'So that's what
following orders leads to.'</p>
<p>"Then when I had to…do what I did to her…I
wanted to be glad she was down and out. But I wasn't."</p>
<p>"Family."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"You don't want to turn against family.
I…know the feeling." His recent quarrels with his Initiative team members
sprang to mind.</p>
<p>"See? But the gang…they're family too.
And I feel like I'm trying to fit Faith in where she doesn't want to be,
and where the gang doesn't want her to be. I just want them to understand."</p>
<p>"Not everybody is forgiving as you. Time
heals all wounds, though, right?"</p>
<p>"Or makes the wound bigger. Then there's
infection, and amputation, and…I know she hurt her, and I don't want to
push either of them…"</p>
<p>"Who are we talking about now?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Willow sat at the bar, thinking. She had
briefly considered ordering a beer, but her previous experimentation with
the stuff had led to Buffy/Spike smoochage, so…no, that was not a good
idea. She needed to figure out what side she was going to come down on,
because she had been in the middle. Like Faith or Hate Faith? Tricky, tricky
question.</p>
<p>How was she supposed to like someone who
had held her at knife tip? Who had used her friend? Who had held her at
knife tip? That was a recurring question. Faith was trying really hard,
she wasn't trying to kill her, and Willow had heard something that she
never thought she would hear the dark-haired slayer say.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Faith had apologized to her. For everything.
And it was sincere. Willow was floored by that. Mostly because she had
filed her under the 'evil psychotic' category, and generally those people
didn't tend to apologize for what they did. She had helped Faith with the
cops because, well, she couldn't not help people who really wanted it.
It was a curse.</p>
<p>Spike being a good example. The vampire
had tried to bite her all those months ago. To change her, and who knows
what else, but her first instinct was not to run away from the demon who
had kidnapped her and tortured her friends, but to comfort him, and allow
him to try and bite her again a half hour later. She eventually came to
her senses, but that was not the point.</p>
<p>"Don't forget that you stopped him from
staking himself, Willow." She told herself.</p>
<p>And the difference between Spike and Faith?
Spike wasn't sorry for anything he did. Faith was. Everyone else forgave
her already. Xander, Giles…and Tara seemed to think she was okay. Tara's
opinions seemed to have a lot of importance to Willow lately, and she was
still struggling to figure out why. Where was she? Oh, forgiveness. Buffy
had forgiven Faith too.</p>
<p>That was the core of her dislike of the
other slayer. Right before Faith's doublecross, Buffy had what seemed to
be every waking moment with her sister in combat. Ah, there it was. The
green eyed monster. Buffy was her friend. Buffy came to her with problems.
Faith wasn't supposed to stay, carve a
 place.</p>
<p>Kendra had been different. Kendra was 'Miss
anti-social'. She had never tried to join the gang, spend time with them…and
Willow just realized how selfish and mean she was being.</p>
<p>"Kendra died, and you're…what am I saying?"
Willow asked herself.</p>
<p>"You okay?"</p>
<p>Who said that? Willow turned her head.
It was Faith.</p>
<p>"Fine, thanks."</p>
<p>"Listen, I never really, thanked you…about
the cops."</p>
<p>"You're welcome, but I only did it because
-"</p>
<p>"Because Buffy asked you to. I know. Still,
you didn't have to."</p>
<p>"Is that it?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's it." Willow began to move.
"I know you hate me. I've never seen anybody so focused on Tekken before.
You must have really wanted to kick my ass."</p>
<p>"I have my reasons."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I guess you do. I wanted her friendship
just as much as yours you know. I'd never met another slayer before her.
She had cool friends, a kick life; I just wanted to be a part of it. I
blew it, but now I got a freebie.</p>
<p>"And I really don't want to screw it up
this time. Just know…I'm not trying to take your guys personal space, and…I'm
done."</p>
<p>Willow just stood still for a second, and
then walked away.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"Oh, this is more like it."</p>
<p>"Whoever you are, I'm not in the mood,
so…" Faith turned around on the barstool and looked up at Spike. "You."</p>
<p>"So this is the infamous Faith. This body
suits you, it really does."</p>
<p>"What's that supposed to mean?"</p>
<p>"Well, Buffy playing Miss Slut, didn't
seem to fit, but this body was built for it." She flipped him the finger.
"Little Missy's got a 'tude, has she? You know, I never saw Red just up
and walk away from somebody like that. You must have really done a number
on her."</p>
<p>"Is there a point to this, Limp Fang?"</p>
<p>"You're just asking for it, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"And I bet you wish you could give it to
me. Too bad, huh?"</p>
<p>Spike had to admit that she was good at
finding the weak points. He just had to keep his rage contained. "You really
think you'll ever be a part of the Scooby troupe? Maybe ride in the Mystery
Machine? Red's got in for you. The only reason they're tolerating you is
cause they're scared."</p>
<p>"Buffy may have a problem with dusting
your ass, but I don't. Just thought I'd get that out there."</p>
<p>"You're trying to hurt me, and I'm sure
I'll get all teary-eyed any minute. You got the darkness in you, girl.
It's only a matter of time before you lose control. And if you think they're
gonna bloody save you from crossing that line, think again. They'll kill
you."</p>
<p>"One last chance."</p>
<p>Spike held up his hands. "I'm gone. But,
I know who you are. Trying to bury it can be unhealthy."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy came over to the table, and saw that
Willow was the only one sitting there.</p>
<p>"Xander went home, and Faith's over at
the bar." Willow said, answering Buffy's silent question.</p>
<p>Buffy sat down. "Riley said to say goodnight."</p>
<p>"Oh."</p>
<p>"Willow…about Faith…"</p>
<p>"You can't make me like her, Buffy."</p>
<p>"I'm not trying to. But I made her hurt,
Will. You don't know what it feels like to plunge a knife into someone's
stomach. A person. It's a sick feeling. Disgusting actually. I hurt her
for you, Xander, Wesley, Angel, Lester, and whoever else.</p>
<p>"I know she did horrible things, but I
just can't hurt her anymore. She doesn't like who she is, and that's hurting
her enough. Plus the guilt. I can't begin to understand how she made you
feel, and I haven't forgotten what she did, so I'm going to say one last
thing."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"You hate Faith…kill her."</p>
<p>"Um…"</p>
<p>"I'm serious. She'd probably let you too.
It'd be over and done with. So, just do it."</p>
<p>"Come on, Buffy. Why are you saying this?"</p>
<p>"You're my best friend, Will. And if you
think Faith is getting in the way…hell, use a gun. I won't stop you. Because
we're friends. I'd always watch your back. Nobody is gonna throw my best
friend in jail. It doesn't matter what you did, or do. We'll -"</p>
<p>"I get it, okay?"</p>
<p>"Do you?"</p>
<p>"Faith's a slayer, and you were, are close,
and no matter what she did you'd always watch out for her. Because you
couldn't not want to help her. Some things just go deep."</p>
<p>"No matter what. Just like I'd do for you.
You and Faith are both really important to me. Equally important. I'd never
leave either of you out of anything."</p>
<p>"You mean you'd stab me in the gut if I
went temporarily crazy too?"</p>
<p>"Anything for you, Will."</p>
<p>Willow smirked. "Faith is still -"</p>
<p>"A sore spot. I get it. I just wanted to
make sure you didn't think I would ever ditch you, or not know how you
feel. I'll always be your friend. And I wanted to try and help you understand
why me and Faith…well, I know I sounded a little nutso, but did you understand
at all?"</p>
<p>"I just need to think."</p>
<p>"Then I'll shut up, and let you deal. I'm
going to the dorm. Wanna come?"</p>
<p>"I think I'll stick around a little longer."</p>
<p>"Okay. Be careful coming back."</p>
<p>"I will."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Faith had thought about what Spike said
for about two seconds. It had gotten to her, though. She knew she had a
dark side, and that wasn't something she could help. Part of her bought
into what he was said, because it was much easier to hate then to work
for friendship. Her problem had been misdirecting her hate towards the
wrong things.</p>
<p>Then she remembered how her last fling
with evil had turned out, and she remembered what he was. If Buffy or the
gang were going to turn on her, she'd know. Not some impotent British vampire
with a Billy Idol complex. After he left the Bronze, things had become
clear. She was never one to take her time thinking things over. She decided
to tail him to the crypt.</p>
<p>She entered a few minutes after he did,
and he sensed her immediately.</p>
<p>"Took my words to heart, did you?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely."</p>
<p>"How'd you find me?"</p>
<p>"Undead Yellow Pages. Damn, there are a
lot of Dracula's in there."</p>
<p>"Slayers. Always punnin'. So tell Ol' Spike
what he can do for you."</p>
<p>"Well, I've been thinking about what you
said. And you're right. I tend to enjoy sex, and killing comes easily."</p>
<p>"As it should, luv."</p>
<p>"Whatever. Anyway, what they don't tell
you is how bad it feels afterwards. Killing comes easy, and pain comes
even easier. That's all I felt when I went after people. But I kept telling
myself, the approval, the praise, for doin' it was worth it. But it really
wasn't."</p>
<p>"How come I don't like where this going?"</p>
<p>"So, in weighing my choices, go all rogue
again, hurt them before they have a chance to hurt me, I remembered what
you said before."</p>
<p>"Before?"</p>
<p>"I looked a little different then, so I'll
give you a sec to think. I make decisions pretty quickly."</p>
<p>She walked down the steps. Spike backed
away. "Shi…" He whispered.</p>
<p>"Got it yet? Good. So there I was, and
you were getting piss drunk and practically begging for attention. Cause
you can't do anything anymore. Can't feed, kill, you're probably an outcast
to all your demon pals too." She stepped closer. "But my revelation, you'll
love this."</p>
<p>"I'm sure."</p>
<p>"Defanged vamp with a hatred for Buffy
tries to get me to turn on her. Make me think she'll turn on me. I'm not
the brightest person in the world, but I put it together. You want me to
kill Buffy for you. Am I right?"</p>
<p>"More or less, yeah."</p>
<p>"Kill Buffy for you…kill Buffy for you…huh.
Don't think so. She's been nothing but good to me."</p>
<p>"That's fine. What's that term? 'My bad?'
Shouldn't have brought it up."</p>
<p>"I'm not finished yet." Spike didn't like
the look in her eye. "You want to see my dark side, Billy? Cause you tried
to use me. I hate being used. I really…really…hate it."</p>
<p>She backed him against the wall. "Sorry?"</p>
<p>"Wanna know what the difference is between
killing a human and a demon is? There's no pain afterwards. Only intense
satisfaction. Almost as good as sex. And you're right. Holding back would
be unhealthy."</p>
<p>That's when she punched him. Hard in the
face. Really hard. He dropped immediately, and she sat over top of him,
hitting his face repeatedly.</p>
<p>"NO." Punch. "BODY." Punch. "USES." Punch.
"ME." Punch. She stopped when she drew blood, and stood up. "You got that?
I've got it too good. I know Buffy wants me around, and I'm not gonna let
asshole losers like you start screwing me over.</p>
<p>"If you ever try it again, I'll get more
creative. If I ever see you coming near…I'll kill you. Got it?"</p>
<p>His coughing up of his own blood was his
only response, and she ran from the crypt.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy was disturbed from her cramming attempts
by loud banging on the door of her and Willow's dorm room. She got off
the bed quickly, and opened it. Faith ran in quickly, falling on the bed.</p>
<p>"Faith? What happened?"</p>
<p>"You…you'd be honest with me if I asked
you a question, right?</p>
<p>"Yeah. I would."</p>
<p>"Do you think I'd hurt you? I mean…"</p>
<p>Buffy sat down on the edge of the bed,
and shook her head. "No." Faith sighed out of relief. "Is that…"</p>
<p>"Blood? Yeah. Let's just say that William
the Bloody's name really fits him now."</p>
<p>"You beat up Spike?"</p>
<p>"He had it coming."</p>
<p>"No argument here. If you hadn't, I probably
would have. But why?"</p>
<p>"He was trying to mess with my head. I
didn't like it." She was holding it in. Everything.</p>
<p>"He's good at that. You can…you know."
Faith shook her head. Buffy had suddenly felt a need to see what she did.
She had never seen the results of what she did to her fellow slayer. "I
hurt you though."</p>
<p>"You got the job done. We covered this.
Hatchet buried, B."</p>
<p>"Can I -" Faith knew what she was talking
about. She lifted her tanktop up a little, and a faint scar was on her
stomach. "God, it's still…"</p>
<p>"It's almost gone."</p>
<p>Unlike Faith, Buffy had no problem letting
tears fall. When she did, Faith wasn't sure what to do. Comforting wasn't
her area of expertise. Buffy did it for her, and rested her head on Faith's
shoulder.</p>
<p>"All right," Buffy said through tears,
"mutual decision, mutual promise, right now. We'll never hurt each other
again." She wiped her eyes. "Willingly. Now possession, magick, and other
supernatural things…well…"</p>
<p>"Promise."</p>
<p>Faith saw Willow slowly enter the room.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Willow came into the room, and saw the
two slayers having a moment. She caught Faith's eyes, and expected to see
a look that said, 'I won this round. Better luck next time.' But she didn't
see that all.</p>
<p>Faith's eyes were asking her to come in.
To help. They were unsure. Confused. Willow shut the door, and made her
way over to where they sat.</p>
<p>Where Buffy sat, and where a person she
was starting to like, possibly even in a 'friend way', sat as well.</p>

<p>Faith stood in the middle of the park.
It was bright, sunny, and peaceful. She saw Xander, Willow and Giles sitting
over at a picnic table. They were calling her over, and she saw Buffy come
up to her. The blonde reached for her hand.</p>
<p>"Come on, we have plenty of food. Don't
tell me you're not hungry."</p>
<p>"I'm coming. Just thinking."</p>
<p>"About?"</p>
<p>"How long this'll last."</p>
<p>"We'll make it last. I've got your back."
Buffy started to look around. Something wasn't right. Faith felt it too.
"Hurry."</p>
<p>The sky changed. Over by the gang, the
sun shined brightly. Past where they stood, the sky had darkened. They
were in the middle. The two slayers tried to go back to their friends,
but they couldn't move. Out of the darkness, a figure emerged.</p>
<p>"Faith, I told you never to leave me. Now
look what you've gone and done. You have to do the right thing, my dear.
I can't wait forever." The Mayor said.</p>
<p>"I am doing the right thing."</p>
<p>"I was hoping you wouldn't say that." Buffy
had had enough. She rushed over to the dark side of the park, ready to
attack him.</p>
<p>"Buffy, no!"</p>
<p>The Mayor changed forms. A large snake
was in his place. Also out of the darkness, came Spike, who held Buffy
still for the hungry beast. Faith ran to try and save her, but as soon
as she got close enough, Spike released Buffy, and threw her back into
the light.</p>
<p>Buffy screamed to her. "Faith! Get out!"
She couldn't help her now.</p>
<p>Faith struggled, as the Mayor-Snake dipped
down, his jaws opened wide.</p>
<p>"You belong here, Faith. Stay with us."</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"NO!"</p>
<p>Two slayers screamed simultaneously, though
both at different places. At Giles' house, Faith's scream awoke Giles,
who was very startled. In the dorm, it awoke Willow, who was instantly
at her friend's side.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"You're sure you're all right?" Giles asked
Faith some fifteen minutes later.</p>
<p>She sat at the table, picking at a scone.
"Just a dream. Nothing."</p>
<p>"Possibly, but in my experience, a slayer's
dreams are more often than not, prophetic."</p>
<p>"Nah, I think it's more my own personal
demons."</p>
<p>"You say that so casually." He came from
the kitchen carrying a kettle. "Tea?"</p>
<p>"It's a gift. I'll pass."</p>
<p>"I'm here to listen if you should ever
need it."</p>
<p>"And major appreciation for that." Faith
got up, and walked over to the stereo. "Mind?"</p>
<p>"Nothing too mind numbing?"</p>
<p>"Reforming Slayer's honor."</p>
<p>She turned on the power, and a song was
just beginning. She waited to see what it was.</p>
<p>(When you look into a mirror
 Do you like what's looking at you
 Now that you've seen your true reflections
 What on earth are you gonna do)</p>
<p>(Find some inspiration
 It's down deep inside of you
 Amend your situation
 Your whole life is ahead of you
 Your whole life is ahead of you)</p>
<p>(Remember the time you hung out with the
boys now
 Remember the things you used to say
 I thought by now you'd be the president
 But after all that was yesterday)</p>
<p>(You've had time to go out in the world
now
 But you chose to run away
 People ask you what your doin' now
 You don't even know what to say)</p>
<p>(You think life is like a movie
 Where it all works out in the end
 I think life is like a dessert
 Where does it go where does it begin)</p>
<p>(When you look into a mirror
 Do you like what's looking at you
 Now that you've seen your true reflections
 What on earth are you gonna do)</p>
<p>(Find some inspiration
 It's down deep inside of you)</p>
<p>She just stood still after it was over.
How come everything just seemed to connect sometimes? The dream…and now
this. Did she like what she saw? She had the inspiration, but was her reflection
changing? Was she changing? Running her hands through her hair, she closed
her eyes, then turned off the stereo, and faced Giles.</p>
<p>"Too early for music, don'tcha think?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>The college gym had become the slayers'
training spot. They were able to schedule to have an hour a day, so no
one would interrupt them. Well, everyone except the gang, and its new member,
who were just observing and speaking amongst themselves. Tara, Willow,
and Xander.</p>
<p>Buffy and Faith were sparring with staffs.
Their bows clashed.</p>
<p>"Where's the Bo', B?" Faith asked her.</p>
<p>"You really have to learn my whole name,
cause that just sounded really funny." She brought the staff to a vertical
position, and Faith matched it. "Actually, if you make the vamps fall over
cause they're laughing hysterically, that could be a bonus."</p>
<p>"So are you gonna answer my question sometime
in the next millennium or what?"</p>
<p>"He's -" Faith tried to sweep her legs,
but Buffy jumped up, missing it. "Teaching."</p>
<p>Faith stopped abruptly, and Buffy was able
to knock the staff out of her hands.</p>
<p>"A teacher?"</p>
<p>"He was my old Psych professor's TA. He
has to take over until they get a replacement."</p>
<p>"How'd she bite it?"</p>
<p>"She's Adam's Dr. Frankenstein."</p>
<p>"Damn. Harsh. Wait, is that the name of
the monster or the guy?"</p>
<p>"I…don't know. Anyway, that's what you
get for messing with the dark, I guess."</p>
<p>They both thought it was a good idea to
stop. They both knew they had shared the dream, though they didn't say
much about it. Now wasn't the time anyway, because they were both still
a little freaked by it.</p>
<p>"It's the name of the guy who made him,"
Xander said, "and is the sweatfest
 over?"</p>
<p>"'Fraid so, Xand."</p>
<p>"There you are!" Anya said loudly, entering
the gym.</p>
<p>"Just in time too." Faith smirked.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>It was the nightly patrol. This time they
were patrolling campus, thinking that's where Adam would stick close to.
This time, Willow and Tara were with them, walking a few feet behind. Xander
was with Anya, apparently "making up for lost time", and they didn't want
to go there. Not even Faith.</p>
<p>"You really wanna be out here?" Willow
asked Tara.</p>
<p>"You talk about it all the time. If this
is something you do, I wanna see...you know, be with you." Tara realized
how that last part sounded. "Be with you when you do this." She looked
away, trying not to hyperventilate.</p>
<p>Willow smiled. "I like that you want to,
really, but it's dangerous."</p>
<p>"It's not that safe for you either, is
it?"</p>
<p>"Well…yeah. But Buffy watches out for me.
That and I use my resolve face till she caves."</p>
<p>"I heard that." Buffy called back.</p>
<p>"And now I have someone to watch over.
I don't wanna see you hurt." Willow whispered, grabbing Tara's hand. "We'll
be careful, and I won't let you be."</p>
<p>"I know. I trust you."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Faith looked back at the two girls. "There's
not many people who can border 'cutesy' and the 'get a room' phase as well
as they can. Not that I'd know much about how relationship phases work,
but - "</p>
<p>Buffy had been lost in thought, absentmindedly
twirling a stake. "Hmmm? What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"You mean you don't…? Nothing."</p>
<p>"Oh. So…the dream."</p>
<p>"Definitely a bitch."</p>
<p>"It had an unpleasant quality to it, yeah.
Do you think that's what we're both scared of?"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"You know. Me not being able to save you
from something and you not…being able to save yourself? I mean, I don't
think it was prophecy-related. Because of what happened with Spike he's
been on our minds, and…"</p>
<p>"Dream psychology and slaying really don't
mix, B." Buffy looked down at the ground. Faith cursed under her breath.
"Hey, you know I'm not exactly the 'lay on a couch, poor out my feelings'
type of girl." 'Or am I and I just don't know it?'</p>
<p>"Yeah. But I had the dream too, and I just
thought that we could try and figure it out. Leaving things unsettled isn't
my style."</p>
<p>"I…when we're done…" Faith trailed off,
her eyes widening. "You can tell me why you totally played down this thing."</p>
<p>"What thing…damn."</p>
<p>They stared at Adam, and he stared right
back.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy risked a glance back at them, and
Faith's look was a little more forceful.</p>
<p>"What's that?" Tara asked, pointing up
ahead.</p>
<p>"Something we run away from." Willow said.</p>
<p>"But -"</p>
<p>"This is also what I do. I go get help."</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"Giles, or Xander, or Riley…just come on."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"I wore him out. I think it was the tying
to the bedpost." Anya said.</p>
<p>She and Xander had come to Giles house.
She was currently explaining to Giles the details of their latest "go in
the hay". Xander was sitting on the steps, his head in his hands. Giles
wasn't fairing much better.</p>
<p>"Why do you insist on always coming here
directly after…God, I can't say it." Giles said.</p>
<p>"You mean after the orgasms?"</p>
<p>Giles rubbed his eyes. "Forget it. Please."</p>
<p>"Well I have to tell somebody. The whole
point of making somebody have good orgasms is to make others jealous."</p>
<p>"Jealous? I'm rather revolted actually.
Most humans do not go into detail about their sexual exploits. Normally,
they light a cigarette and keep things to themselves."</p>
<p>"Where's the fun in that? And cigarettes
aren't good for health."</p>
<p>"And you're not good for mine." Giles muttered.
He looked over at Xander, trying to understand why the boy was just satisfied…he
stopped that train of thought immediately.</p>
<p>"I don't think he wants us here. We should
leave."</p>
<p>Xander jumped up off the steps. "Oh thank
God."</p>
<p>Just then, the front door opened, and Tara
and Willow came bursting in. They were both out of breath.</p>
<p>"Good…you're here…" Willow panted.</p>
<p>"Willow, what is it?"</p>
<p>"Buffy…Faith…went…Riley's…not there…campus…bad…Adam…"</p>
<p>"Buffy and Faith are on campus and they're
in trouble. Adam's there." Tara cleared up.</p>
<p>Willow nodded quickly. Xander ran to the
chest of weapons, and pulled out the blaster.</p>
<p>"Stay here." Giles told the three girls.</p>
<p>"We can do a protection spell." Tara offered.</p>
<p>"Anything that might help is a good idea."</p>
<p>Anya went up to Xander and kissed him quickly,
and then he and Giles were out the door.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy and Faith circled Adam cautiously.
He had not made a move, but was merely watching them. Studying them. Normally
Faith would rush in and attack, but most bad guys weren't as calm as he
seemed to be. She couldn't predict what he was going to do, and her Slayer
"sixth sense" was telling her to be cautious. Buffy was glad Faith was
following it for once.</p>
<p>"So, Adam, where's your flunkies?" Buffy
asked.</p>
<p>"Flunkies?" He appeared to think a second.
"Ah. The vampires. I have no desire to waste a resource. You would easily
end their existence, would you not?"</p>
<p>"Yep. Can see you're still big on the learning
and science experiments."</p>
<p>He appeared to think once more. "Yes. Buffy
Anne Summers. You possess strength that others of your species do not.
Enemy of vampires. A Slayer. An intriguing being."</p>
<p>"That's me. Have you met Faith? We're in
the same business."</p>
<p>"Whoever did the rush job on you has to
go back to the drawing board." Faith said.</p>
<p>"A sarcastic remark meant to increase anger.
I am unaffected."</p>
<p>"But I try so hard."</p>
<p>"I was informed of your presence. My learning
process is nearly complete. But I must know something. A question plagues
me."</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>"Faith Adams. Eighteen human years. Conceived
in Boston by Jack and Christine." Faith paled, and Buffy just held her
breath.</p>
<p>"Father arrested for spousal abuse the
following year and convicted in conjunction with possession of narcotics.</p>
<p>"At age five police were called to your
residence for a domestic disturbance. You were found in the corner, shattered
alcoholic containers surrounding you, facial lacerations and cigarette
burns on your forearm.</p>
<p>"Taken to a hospital, several hours later,
doctors were shocked to learn that all your wounds had healed. Mother agreed
to attend meetings and seek counseling in order to retain custody.</p>
<p>"A year later your father was released
on probation and forced to go to a drug treatment center. He returned home
and proceeded to strangle your mother terminating her life. Police arrived
just before your father did the same to you."</p>
<p>Faith was shaking, and couldn't move. Buffy
knew she had to make some kind of move. This was too much.</p>
<p>"You were placed in an orphanage. Caretakers
noted that you were frightened, sometimes hostile. At the age of fourteen
you had tried to run away several times, succeeding temporarily, for months
at a time. Authorities often found you in bars or street corners, offering
yourself.</p>
<p>"They repeatedly returned you, despite
your attempts to stay away. They did not recommend you for a foster home,
or adoption. Psychologists recorded deep emotional scarring, and they couldn't
stop you from trying to take your own life.</p>
<p>"At fifteen, despite objections, a woman
chose to adopt you, and strangely, there is no more record of your existence
after that point."</p>
<p>"That woman was my watcher, you bastard."
Faith said.</p>
<p>"Bastard? Hmm…fatherless son. That's an
appropriate description."</p>
<p>Buffy was a few feet behind him.</p>
<p>"What's your question?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>"I know all about you, yet I can't understand
the reason you continue to live. Is it not rather pointless?" Faith was
clenching her fists. "My question upsets you? Interesting."</p>
<p>Buffy ran, and jumped on his back, grabbing
around his neck area. Faith's attention had been focused on Adam, so she
had not seen where Buffy went. Adam flung her off, and she hit a tree.</p>
<p>"Buffy! No!"</p>
<p>Faith charged him and he grabbed her easily
by the neck.</p>
<p>"Faith! Get -" Buffy yelled, and tried
to run to help, but something pulled her back.</p>
<p>"Your life has been full of negative emotion.
Humans, I've learned, struggle with such feelings. Losses, grief, pain.
The right thing to do would be to end it. Would you like me to?"</p>
<p>Faith struggled, her legs kicking wildly.
"I'm doing the right thing. I don't need the easy way out."</p>
<p>"What do you need?" Adam squeezed harder.
"Air? Friendship? Lov -"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Adam was cut off, as he felt an electrical
blast hit him from behind. He dropped Faith, who was gasping for air. Seemingly
out of nowhere, a team of commandos in full gear came out of the shadows,
and surrounded him. Buffy ran in, and pulled Faith out quickly.</p>
<p>All the men aimed at him, firing, but except
for being mildly jolted, he continued to walk. As he reached a man standing
in his way, he released a skewer from his arm, which went directly through
the man's heart.</p>
<p>"Fall back!" One of them yelled.</p>
<p>They broke out of their containment formation,
and Adam continued to walk.</p>
<p>"I can learn no more here." He said.</p>
<p>One of the men waved his hand, and four
commandos disappeared, silently following Adam. Three others picked up
their dead friend, and vanished into the darkness as well. All except one,
who rushed over to Buffy and Faith. He took off his facemask.</p>
<p>It was Riley, and as soon as Faith saw
that it was him, she bounced up and grabbed him by the shirt.</p>
<p>"How. Did. He. Know." She said, stated
each word slowly, and angrily.</p>
<p>"Professor Walsh must have downloaded files
into his brain."</p>
<p>"But you didn't know about slayers until
me." Buffy said.</p>
<p>"No, we didn't. The Initiative has files
on anyone who's ever been in Sunnydale. No matter who it is. It's policy
handed down by the higher ups."</p>
<p>Faith let go of his uniform, but still
glared at him.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you tell us?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"I wasn't sure if...not until I saw."</p>
<p>"Like hell." Faith said.</p>
<p>"How'd you know he was here?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"I was down there searching through the
computers when Graham spotted him walking on campus. Since I was there,
and I'm commanding officer, I led the team. I'm just glad we were in time."</p>
<p>"Good thing you were." Faith turned and
walked away somewhat. "Later, okay?"</p>
<p>Riley nodded, and walked off. Neither he
nor the two slayers saw the person watching off to the side. Buffy went
over to Faith, and they both knew the dream discussion wasn't necessary
anymore.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Faith couldn't hide her past anymore, either.
She wanted to remain stone-faced, and tough, but as soon as she caught
Buffy's eyes and comfort they were offering, telling her it was okay, she
dropped to her knees, her entire body shaking with sobs.</p>
<p>Buffy wrapped her arms around her friend,
her partner.</p>
<p>"Look at me. I'm…"</p>
<p>"A survivor."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah? And what do I have to show for
it?"</p>
<p>"A friend."</p>
<p>"Who pities me."</p>
<p>"Who respects you, and wants your friendship
too."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Cause, well…you're wicked cool girlfriend."
Faith choked on her own laughter, and Buffy tried to glare, but couldn't
pull it off. "And it looks like some of our other friends are calling us
over."</p>
<p>Faith looked up and saw Giles and Xander
standing a couple yards away. She got up, shook off her tears, and with
Buffy's arm around her shoulders, they went to meet them.</p>

<p>Spike stalked the campus grounds, trying
to fool himself into thinking he was still menacing. He was tired of everything.
Being beaten and hated by demons, some he could have easily ripped apart
if it wasn't for the chip, as well as taking beating from slayers with
short fuses. His reputation as an "evil bad ass" who killed two slayers
was no longer respected, and he decided it was time to do something about
that.</p>
<p>Not being able to kill allowed him some
freedom, however. Since he was no longer considered a threat, nobody paid
him much mind. That let him watch. Let him watch. Let him gather information
that could prove useful to him if he shared it with the right people. Might
get him back in the game. Why?</p>
<p>Because he planned to snitch. In exchange
for his un-neutering, of course. All he had to do was find one of the Initiative
guys. Plus, he would kill two birds with one stone. He would be able to
feed and taste human blood again, and would finally be able to strike back
at Buffy without laying a hand on her. But when he was "restored", he and
Faith were going to have a round or two.</p>
<p>He moved along the treeline now, and suddenly
felt like he was being followed. He turned his head to see, using his vampire
sight to scan the darkness, but saw nothing. When he turned back around,
a blaster was an inch away from his face.</p>
<p>"This was a bad idea."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"This was a bad idea." Faith said.</p>
<p>Across town, Buffy and Faith were approaching
her house, slowly making their way up the walk. It was the weekend, and
Tara, Willow and the two of them were going to have a girl's night. They
came straight from patrol, and Faith was just a little nervous.</p>
<p>"Why? Cause sleepovers aren't your thing?"
Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"Never had one before, but yeah. I'm more
a -"</p>
<p>"Dance club gyrator who likes to get all
the guys hot and horny. I know. And that is fun and certainly has its place."</p>
<p>Images of their dance at the Bronze last
year flashed through her mind. She had just let go, and it had been very
enjoyable.</p>
<p>"I'll admit that sleepovers might be considered
tame next to that, but they're nice too. Relaxing even. Besides it gets
you out of Giles' for awhile."</p>
<p>"Yeah, that chick of his just blew into
town, and it hasn't been quiet since."</p>
<p>"Bad images?"</p>
<p>"Nah. G was always kinda cute. The fact
that I'm not getting any 'oomph' is driving me nuts."</p>
<p>"Once again ignoring the Giles comment,
you and the grunting. You should see somebody about that."</p>
<p>"Didn't I just say that was the problem?"</p>
<p>"I guess…I meant…well, sorry I…can't help
there." Buffy stuttered.</p>
<p>'I'm sorry you can't either. What the hell?
Don't even go there.'</p>
<p>They made it to the porch, and Buffy reached
for the door handle. Their two Wiccan friends were already inside.</p>
<p>"Your mom."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"She doesn't want me in there. That's why
I don't…"</p>
<p>"It'll be okay. She knows you're coming,
and she's very forgiving, my mom is."</p>
<p>"She's letting me in just like that?"</p>
<p>"We might have…debated a little." Buffy
said slowly.</p>
<p>"Always going to bat for me, aren't you?"</p>
<p>Buffy smiled at her, and turned the knob.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Spike stood in the open ' briefing area'
of the underground complex, in the center of a circle of commandos who
had their weapons pointed at him. They were ready to fire at a moment's
notice. He was definitely beginning to think he made a big mistake.</p>
<p>The circle parted just enough for a man
to walk through.</p>
<p>"Hostile Seventeen." Forrest said.</p>
<p>"It's Spike, Soldier Boy."</p>
<p>"Shock it." One of the men stepped forward
and released an electrical charge from his weapon. Spike shook violently,
dropping to the ground. Forrest knelt down. "Animals don't have names.
Give me one reason why we shouldn't put you to sleep."</p>
<p>"Cause you're gonna wanna hear what I have
to say, mate."</p>
<p>"Put it in a cage."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"We're here!" Buffy called out. "Oh, there's
something I have to -"</p>
<p>Joyce walked into the foyer from the kitchen,
and Faith cast her eyes downward.</p>
<p>"It went okay?" Joyce asked.</p>
<p>"Only one baddie tonight." Buffy whispered
to Faith. "I promised her she could talk to you…um…alone."</p>
<p>Faith paled, and Buffy looked at her mother,
pleading with her eyes telling her mom to go easy on Faith. She went upstairs
slowly. Once her daughter was no longer in view, Joyce turned to Faith.</p>
<p>"Kitchen please."</p>
<p>"Uh, sure, Mrs. S."</p>
<p>Faith followed her into the kitchen, and
immediately hopped up and sat on the edge of the counter. Joyce's look
just as immediately told her to find somewhere else to sit. Faith removed
herself from the counter and spoke apologetically.</p>
<p>"Kind of a reflex. Sorry." She saw the
suitcases sitting by the back door. "Going somewhere?"</p>
<p>"Auction in Nevada to get some new pieces
for the Gallery. But I wanted to talk to you first."</p>
<p>Faith nervously slid her hands through
her hair. Just over a month ago she had held this woman hostage waiting
for Buffy to arrive. The woman had also called her psychotic. At the time,
and given the situation, she was right on the money. But how were they
supposed to do this? She had always liked Joyce. She was Faith's idea of
the perfect mom.</p>
<p>'Start by saying your sorry. You're pretty
used to saying it by now, aren't you?'</p>
<p>"Listen, I'm -" Faith started to say.</p>
<p>"Okay, I've thought about this for awhile.
And I've decided that if Buffy has forgiven you, then you must be -"</p>
<p>"Sane again?"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't have put it exactly like that."</p>
<p>"It's okay. I'm happier now. You were right."</p>
<p>"Mother's intuition. I can't not forgive
someone who makes an effort to turn her life around. Especially someone
who helps my daughter."</p>
<p>"It's my job."</p>
<p>"I don't just mean the slaying." Faith
showed her puzzlement clearly. "You don't know that she spent hours every
day by your bed in the summer, do you?"</p>
<p>"She did?"</p>
<p>"The last thing she wanted was you to be
in the hospital. She used to tell me how she thought it was her fault.
That if she'd reached you sooner you wouldn't have left. If she had been
more of a friend. She kept going to see you hoping you'd wake up.</p>
<p>"She thought since you both healed fast,
you'd bounce back quickly. Every time, it was always the same, and she
came home torturing herself."</p>
<p>"I knew she felt bad…"</p>
<p>"Well, I was surprised she talked to me
about it. She said Xander and Willow wouldn't understand. I didn't really
understand. All I knew was that she was hurting. The summer ended, and
you were still there. She gave the hospital our number and Mr. Giles'.
She called every night until you woke up a couple weeks ago."</p>
<p>"Wow." Faith said quietly.</p>
<p>"I like you, Faith, and so does my daughter.
So I'll only say this once. Don't ever hurt her again."</p>
<p>The tone in Joyce's voice made Faith forget
her enhanced strength entirely. She really didn't want to have to face,
or imagine, the possible
 consequences.</p>
<p>"Never. I swear."</p>
<p>Joyce smiled. "Good." She went to the door,
and began picking up the suitcases. "Then you…have fun, and…try not to
drink too much."</p>
<p>"Drink?"</p>
<p>"I've got a daughter in college, I have
alcohol in the house, and people are spending the night. I'm not that naive.
But as long as there's no evidence when I get back, I can remain in denial."</p>
<p>"You're pretty cool, you know that?"</p>
<p>Joyce opened the door. "Please. That's
a mother's worst nightmare."</p>
<p>Faith chuckled. "Later, Mrs. S."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Spike pulled himself up off the floor of
the cell, trying to get his bearings. When he realized where he was, he
cursed. He had already been locked away in the white, white, and more white,
walled cell. It was worse the second time. He saw Forrest staring in at
him from the other side of electric field keeping him from escaping.</p>
<p>"Organizational problems?" Spike asked.
"I heard things have been going downhill here lately."</p>
<p>"Is that right?" Forrest said.</p>
<p>"And since I got nothing to lose, and you've
got everything to lose, you're gonna listen to what I have to say, caged
or not."</p>
<p>"Then start."</p>
<p>"Slayer's been mucking up the works, right?
Your leader is dead, your new leader is whipped beyond belief…but you can't
do jack."</p>
<p>Forrest knew the vampire was right. The
Initiative wasn't running very smoothly anymore, Riley, the next in the
chain of command was never here, and when he was it was for very brief
periods of time, and Buffy. He wanted her out of everything. When she arrived,
that's when everything started to fall apart.</p>
<p>"What have you got?" Forrest asked, walking
up close to the cage.</p>
<p>"You're military. You got rules. Well I
can show you proof that your new commander is playing both sides trying
to close up this place. Then you take action."</p>
<p>"The catch?"</p>
<p>"I show you, you take this chip outta my
head, and I take care of your slayer problem. What you do with 'Mr. Iowa'
is your call. Do we have a deal?"</p>
<p>Forrest locked eyes with Spike. He had
so much hatred for this hostile. If he set him free, he could terrorize
innocent people. But if he was right, the Initiative could be put on track
again, and Riley and Buffy would be dealt with. He punched some numbers
into the keypad, and the field shut off.</p>
<p>"Let's go. I want this proof in my hands
before you get anything."</p>
<p>"Take it easy, Blade Jr. You'll get your
proof. Riley's a big deal around here, so when you see it…"</p>
<p>"I do what needs to be done."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>The four girls were in the living room
watching the single television in the house. Faith and Buffy were lounging
on the sofa, and Willow and Tara were lying on the floor. Boredom had officially
set in an hour before. They were watching a re-run of South Park.</p>
<p>"You'd think with my time off they'd get
their asses in gear and make new eps." Faith said.</p>
<p>"The animation isn't even that complicated."
Buffy agreed. "Who wants popcorn?"</p>
<p>Three hands raised. Faith picked up the
remote and started going through channels as Buffy got up to go to the
kitchen. She stared down at the redhead and the blonde witch. Tara was
looking at Willow, with the 'I love you and can't stand it' look.</p>
<p>Then it hit Faith. Willow didn't know.
She had just assumed, but Willow didn't really know. It wasn't like she
was going to play matchmaker; she just found it amusing. She needed to
be sure of something before she would even consider getting involved in
Willow's life anyway.</p>
<p>"Hey, Willow?"</p>
<p>Willow turned her head. "Yeah?"</p>
<p>"We're five by five, right?"</p>
<p>"We are." She smiled in reassurance.</p>
<p>"Okay that's it." Tara said standing. "I
need to find out what that means or I'll go crazy."</p>
<p>Willow stood up too. "We could look it
up on the net. Buffy's mom has a laptop somewhere."</p>
<p>Buffy walked in then, carrying a bowl of
popcorn. "Feel free. It's gathering dust in her closet."</p>
<p>"Um…I've never really…used computers…that
much." Tara said slowly.</p>
<p>Willow gaped, and the slayers' held their
breaths. Buffy carefully put the bowl down, and made her way over to Willow.
Just in case of fainting. Willow's lips were moving, but no sound was coming
out.</p>
<p>"I think you broke her." Faith said.</p>
<p>Before Tara could respond, her hand was
being grabbed, and Willow practically ran up the steps with her in tow.
About ten minutes later they heard Willow's voice again, and the loud modem
noises one would expect when connecting.</p>
<p>"We lost 'em forever." Buffy said, coming
to sit on the couch.</p>
<p>"Then it's a good thing I didn't mention
my lack of computer skills." Faith said.</p>
<p>"Probably." Buffy laughed. "So what do
you want to do?"</p>
<p>Faith jumped off the couch then, and headed
for the kitchen. "Make drinks."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"As in alcohol?" Buffy asked, following
her into the kitchen.</p>
<p>"No, as in Shirley Temples." Faith said
sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Beer and I really don't mix."</p>
<p>Faith was searching through the cabinets.
"Who said anything about beer? There's a time and a place for it, yeah.
Usually parties. I was thinking daiquiris."</p>
<p>"Daiquiris? Isn't that a little tame for
you?"</p>
<p>"Normally, but I promised your mom there
would be no evidence, and for me to stick to it, gotta go 'buzz only' tonight.
She's gotta have -"</p>
<p>"Whoa. Whoa. Hold it. You told my mom we
were going to drink?"</p>
<p>"No. She expects us to. And I don't want
to disappoint her. Now are you gonna help me or not?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. What are you looking for?"</p>
<p>"Rum and strawberries."</p>
<p>Buffy went over to the fridge, and pulled
out a bag of strawberries. She set them on the counter. In the cabinet
below the sink, were bottles of rum and other assorted alcoholic beverages.
She got out a bottle, and set that out on the counter as well.</p>
<p>"Now what?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Spike kicked in Buffy and Willow's dorm
room door, and walked in. Forrest followed from behind.</p>
<p>"So where is it?" He asked Spike.</p>
<p>"Here. Been watching them. He gives her
files, and then she takes them back here. She didn't want to risk that
ex-librarian's life by leaving them with him. Thoughtful girl, isn't she?"</p>
<p>Spike checked under the beds.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>The bureau.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>By Willow's computer.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>That's when he opened the closet. First
he only saw clothes, and then he looked up at the ceiling. There was a
good-sized vent there. He pushed on it, and it moved. He slid the covering
off, and stuck his hand into the vent. He felt something.</p>
<p>"Clever, Slayer, but not clever enough."</p>
<p>Coming out of the closet a few seconds
later, he held a slightly bent folder in his hands that had the word classified
on it printed in big red letters. He handed it to Forrest, who looked through
it.</p>
<p>"This is a member list and history going
all the way -"</p>
<p>"Great. I fulfilled my end, give me what
I want."</p>
<p>Forrest stared at him, closed the folder,
and grabbed his walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>"Deactivate HST Seventeen's implant. Now."</p>
<p>Before Spike knew what was happening, he
was having some kind of a seizure,
and had collapsed to the ground, unconscious.
Forrest left the room, shutting the door behind him.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Later, Faith and Buffy were quite buzzed,
but still coherent, sipping from their second daiquiris of the night. They
had offered drinks to the girls upstairs, but they hadn't received any
answer. Faith whispered to Buffy on the sofa.</p>
<p>"They're...you know…"</p>
<p>Buffy went wide-eyed, and then slapped
Faith's arm. "They are not!"</p>
<p>"I'm wicked serious. They do, but Willow
doesn't know. Don't tell me you haven't noticed."</p>
<p>"I guess…I…"</p>
<p>"Does that wig you out?"</p>
<p>"Hey if she wants to be gay, who am I to
get all freaked out? We've been through too much for me to care about something
like that. What kind of friend would be if I didn't stand behind her?"</p>
<p>"Good for you."</p>
<p>"Plus, if Tara makes her happy, I'm all
for it. Especially cause of Oz."</p>
<p>"Yeah, what happened there? He knock claws
with a she-wolf or something?" Buffy simply stared. "He did? And here I
always thought he was a stand up guy. Guess they'll always stay an impossible
dream."</p>
<p>"You said it."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? You got Beefstick."</p>
<p>"Hey!" Buffy waggled her finger. "His name
is Riley. And he's still got this blockage about not being equal to me.
Macho and identity issues. It's a lot of work."</p>
<p>"You don't love him?"</p>
<p>"I…yeah, I do. But he's got…well, let's
look at my men history. Angel nearly drained me of all my blood and then
skipped town."</p>
<p>"You let him bite you?"</p>
<p>"Saved his life. Then he leaves. Then he
comes back to," Buffy made quote marks with her fingers, "rescue me, doesn't
say a word and leaves again."</p>
<p>"Can I call him an asshole?"</p>
<p>"I'll join you."</p>
<p>"Asshole." They both said at the same time.</p>
<p>"Scott dumped me cause I wasn't stable
enough. But you took care of him for me." Buffy grinned.</p>
<p>"Which was major fun."</p>
<p>"Then I got used by Parker…he pulled a
number on me."</p>
<p>Faith's eyes suddenly got serious. "The
guy used you?"</p>
<p>"I got over it. Was kind of going through
a self-image problem for awhile, but I moved on to Riley."</p>
<p>"Nobody should ever, ever, use you, Buffy.
You're too…" Faith trailed off, still sober enough to know not to finish.</p>
<p>"Hey you said my name! Yay!"</p>
<p>Faith smiled again. "That 'uffy' part always
trips me up."</p>
<p>"I like 'B'. I always know who's talking
to me. I'd never let anyone else call me that."</p>
<p>They stared at each other in silence. They
couldn't turn away. Both girls knew this conversation, this whatever, had
to stop. They weren't thinking straight, and there could and would be complications.
Of that they were sure. Buffy decided that now was the time to stop drinking,
and get up. Possibly get a shower to clear her head. A cold shower.</p>
<p>She rose off the couch, and was about to
say something when Faith pulled her back down, and kissed her. Hard. And
Buffy responded, despite her better judgement. She didn't know what was
happening.</p>
<p>Well she knew what was happening. Her tongue
was dueling with Faith's. Her hands running through Faith's hair.</p>
<p>But she didn't understand why. Actually
she did. Because she wanted to. But she really didn't know why she wanted
to. Well, because it felt good. So she kept doing it.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"You think they're okay?" Tara asked Willow
upstairs.</p>
<p>"I'm sure. What could possibly happen?"</p>
<p>Tara didn't know how much longer she could
go without telling Willow her feelings. She was afraid, but she had never
felt this way about anybody before. Not like this.</p>
<p>"Probably nothing." Tara sighed, seeing
that Willow didn't catch her double meaning. "So what's URL mean?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Back in the Initiative, Forrest was speaking
to a group of his fellow marines and soldiers.</p>
<p>"We have a situation. It involves Agent
Finn, and it'll have to be addressed as soon as possible."</p>
