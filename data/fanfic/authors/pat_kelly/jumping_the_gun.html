<!-- Jumping the Gun \ Story -->

<p>The blonde and the redhead had gone to directly to the Summers' residence
after leaving
the dorm, bringing all their belongings with
them. Willow had a passing thought of returning home and staying bunked
there for the
summer, but then she thought…what the heck
for? She had sent her parents lots of letters during the course of the
year, but they
never responded. Now they probably weren't even
home.</p>
<p>Joyce had quickly offered her free room and board for the three months the
two girls were
education-free as soon as she heard of the
dilemma. Buffy had been more than a little ecstatic. They had been
roommates all year,
though absent a lot. Nevertheless, neither
Buffy nor Willow was ready to give that up. Just the fact that one of them
was always
close by was comforting.</p>
<p>Even when Buffy was with Riley, and Willow was with Tara, there was still
that best-friend
connection that went deeper then any of
their romantic others. They fought a lot over the year. Especially two
weeks before
graduating. The "fight to end all fights" that they
never planned to do again. But they wouldn't have fought if they didn't
care about each
other. They could have just walked away. But
there was no way in hell that they were going to do that.</p>
<p>A four-year friendship that survived a Harvest, two attempts by hell to
take over the
earth, an attempted ascension, and a military
screw up, was going to suddenly dissolve over a choice of lovers? And how
said lovers
might have kept them separated from the
group? No, of course not. So they had begun to patch things up, and talk
things out. They
were both in the wrong, had let things drift.
Well there was to be no more of that.</p>
<p>Ever again.</p>
<p>So focused were they on regaining closeness that something very bizarre
occurred. They had
had dreams. And after what had
happened with their last dreaming experience, they were more than a little
concerned about
having such vivid sleep travels again. But
they did, and had survived once more. What they didn't realize as they were
having the
dreams, was that they were all about one
thing. Despite the differences, it was about their relationship to one
another.</p>
<p>What it was and what it could be.</p>
<p>As soon as they had woken up, everything clicked into place, and they both
had a
suspicious feeling that it was all planned that way.
There was talking to be done obviously, which they both readily agreed to.
Now in Buffy's
bedroom, the day passed and in their
pajamas, they sat in a comfortable silence, allowing themselves time to
think before any
talking began. Because they knew when they
started, things were going to change. In the back of their minds, they knew
exactly what
that change was.</p>
<p>"Will?"</p>
<p>The hacker/wicca turned her head to look at her friend who sat on the other
side of the
bed. Buffy had forgone patrolling tonight for
this, and the time for it had finally arrived. There was no turning back
now.</p>
<p>"Yeah, Buffy?"</p>
<p>The seconds seemed to drag on, as Buffy fiddled with Mr. Gordo, and then
stared
Willow directly in the eyes.</p>
<p>"Marry me."</p>
<p>Willow's eyes bugged out, and time stopped completely. Whatever happened to
small changes?</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"Oh no. I've broken you. " Buffy smiled, amused.</p>
<p>"No, no. Not broken. Maybe malfunctioning a little." Willow said, still a
little shocked.
"I just thought we'd start with something more
simple. Like, 'How was your dream, Willow?' And then I'd answer, 'Oh it was
pretty weird
but I found it kind of illuminating and' -"</p>
<p>Buffy giggled at first and then went for full blown hysterical laughter.
She fell back
onto her pillows, muffling her laughter with her
stuffed pig. Willow looked at her like she couldn't understand what could
possibly be
funny. It was a very serious thing. Very, very
serious. Buffy saw Willow's face, and tried to look sorry for her outburst
as quickly as
possible.</p>
<p>"Did I jump the gun a little?" Willow nodded. She pointed her finger at the
mattress.
"Lay with me."</p>
<p>"Sure…I can do that. It's a simple movement of the body into a vertical
position. Simple
is good." Buffy wrapped her arm around
Willow's waist and pulled her down. "What's this for?"</p>
<p>The slayer found her nose filled with the scent of Willow's hair. "Just
wanted to see what
this felt like."</p>
<p>"Oh. Like experimenting."</p>
<p>"Mm hmm."</p>
<p>"Well if it helps, data-wise, I don't think this is so bad."</p>
<p>"I'm thinking that too." She waited another second before continuing. "That
marriage thing
just came out. I guess…I don't
know…everything hit me at once. Didn't mean to say it like that."</p>
<p>"In the future, marrying, you know, could be really…nice. Just not so
soon."</p>
<p>"See what comes out of my mouth when I have a lot of time to think? Crazy
things. Nutty
even."</p>
<p>"Not nutty, just…"</p>
<p>"Insane. Don't try to clean it up, Will." She smirked. "But you wouldn't be
totally
freaked by that possibility?"</p>
<p>Willow sat back up, and Buffy followed. "No, I know how you feel. My dream
got me thinking
about everything, you know? And on
top of the distancing thing we've been doing, it makes sense."</p>
<p>"It does?"</p>
<p>"What is the closest two people could possibly get? Married. So you went
for maximum
closeness possibility." Buffy leaned back,
propping herself up on her elbow, and stared at Willow. "What?"</p>
<p>"I just realized how much I missed this, you, everything." She contemplated
quietly.</p>
<p>"But that is kind of crazy. Changing everything because of a dream? We must
be off our
rockers. And that's hard to do considering
we're not wrinkly enough to have rockers." Willow started to feel her face.
"I don't have
wrinkles, right?" She asked, suddenly
worried.</p>
<p>Buffy smiled. "You scare me when you do that."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Channel Cordelia." The hacker looked horrified. "They weren't normal
dreams, Will. I
really don't think Tara was a figment of my
imagination."</p>
<p>"Me either. I mean…not that she usually is a figment of my imagination."
Willow tried to
say as casually as possible.</p>
<p>Buffy didn't take the opportunity to tease her friend. Her mind was
elsewhere. "She was in
your dream too?"</p>
<p>Willow let it sink in. "K…uh…this is just weird." She said
slowly.</p>
<p>"Agreed." Buffy said with a firm nod. "Ice cream?"</p>
<p>"Yeah…yeah. Ice cream."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy came out of the kitchen holding two cartons and two spoons. Willow
watched her every
move until she sat down on the couch.
Then Willow looked at the cartons and noticed the absence of something very
important.</p>
<p>"Bowls?" She asked Buffy.</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it. Mom's doing inventory at the gallery all night. I
won't tell if you
don't." Buffy responded with a mischievous glint
in her eye.</p>
<p>Willow looked at her with a stern, almost disappointed expression. Buffy
looked down, and
then wordlessly headed towards the
kitchen to get bowls. Back on the couch, Willow grinned. It was nice to
know that she
still had that effect on the blonde. Buffy had a
feeling she had been played, and turned around, catching her
friend.</p>
<p>Buffy shook her head, smiling and pointing a finger at the redheaded
trickster. "You,
missy," she walked closer to the couch, "are
more evil then the Mayor, Adam, and the Initiative combined. Guilt-trip
queen is what you
are."</p>
<p>Willow never faltered. "Well, if I'm evil, there's only one thing you can
do."</p>
<p>The glint was back in Buffy's eye. She jumped on the couch, and began to
unmercifully
tickle her. Willow quickly turned red, and was
laughing until it hurt. When she felt Buffy stop, she caught her breath and
spoke.</p>
<p>"I was thinking you would pour some holywater on me and I would pretend to
writhe in
uncontrollable pain. Tickling is so…unfair."</p>
<p>"Since when is revenge fair?"</p>
<p>"Since when do you use logic?"</p>
<p>"I'd be careful, Will. I don't think you can handle anymore." Buffy poised
her fingers,
and Willow just grabbed the carton of fudge-nut,
brownie ice cream and began to eat. "Uh oh. I said a bad thing, didn't
I?"</p>
<p>Willow dodged, licking the spoon. "It's nothing."</p>
<p>Buffy laid her hand on top of Willow's free one. "That's what got us in
trouble before.
You can tell me. I'm thick. It's the only way I'll
learn."</p>
<p>Willow sighed. "It's just…it seems like you always tell me what you think I
can or can't
handle. I've been doing some big things with
magick, and it…hurts me that you don't see that."</p>
<p>Buffy felt like smacking herself on the head. "I do see it. I did see it. I
couldn't have
beaten Adam if you hadn't done that spell. You
kept me alive. And I know I haven't been there in the showing appreciation
department, but
I do, believe me. Things'll be different
from now on, I promise.</p>
<p>"Want me to be honest with you? You doing magick does scare me. Not cause I
think you
can't do it, but cause I know you can. I
just care about you so much, and I don't want to ever see you hurt. All I
want to do is
protect you. You're my rock, you know that
right?"</p>
<p>Willow smiled, teary-eyed. "I was beginning to wonder."</p>
<p>"Don't. It's just my mental blockage. But I'm working on it. My biggest
fear has always
been seeing your name on a headstone."</p>
<p>"And what do you think my biggest fear is?"</p>
<p>"Frogs?"</p>
<p>"Ha, ha. " Willow said sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Hug." They did, and it felt really good. "I'll be there for you with the
magick. And if I
start acting like an overprotective nut, I want
you to tell me, okay?"</p>
<p>"Will do." Willow smiled.</p>
<p>Buffy sat the second carton on her lap, put her arm around Willow's
shoulders, and turned
on the TV.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"Hmm…" Buffy said softly after about fifteen minutes of surfing. She
finally stopped on
something familiar. "Look, Apocalypse Now."</p>
<p>Willow started reaching for the remote. "Turn it off! Turn it off!" She
said frantically.</p>
<p>She retrieved it, and turned on ABC's TGIF lineup. Sabrina was just
starting. Buffy stared
at her friend with the 'why and how could
you possibly like this' look. After about a minute of silent musing, she
decided to
vocalize her concern over Willow's choice of
viewing.</p>
<p>"Aren't you a tad old to be watching this? And I'd think, being a witch,
you'd be offended
by the inaccuracies."</p>
<p>"Okay, so maybe the talking cat is a bit of a stretch," she remembered the
mean Miss Kitty
from her dream and shuddered, "but it's
still wholesome G-rated fun."</p>
<p>"I just think the bad blonde actress makes you think of Tara." Willow
blushed, caught.
"How come you didn't tell me about her
sooner? I would've supported you."</p>
<p>"I knew that, I think. It's not that I didn't trust you to be there, or
that I didn't want
to include her with my friends, but my life is
dangerous. I just wanted to protect her for as long as I could, I
guess."</p>
<p>"I can understand that." Buffy said knowingly. "And just in case I wasn't
clear, I'm not
freaked. Caught off guard, yeah. Plus, I'm
beginning to have alternative feelings myself. Starting to see
things."</p>
<p>"What kind of things?" Willow said nervously, taking a big spoonful of ice
cream.</p>
<p>"I'm starting to realize that I should have fallen in love with you a long
time ago. It
took Tara and a little bit of jealousy to show me
how blind I am."</p>
<p>"You were jealous?"</p>
<p>"Duh. You were with Tara whenever I was actually in the room. I just
thought I was upset
that you weren't there, but really, it's
because she got you first. I know that now."</p>
<p>"I didn't really know about my feelings for her until Oz came back. She was
just a friend.
And what about when I was in the dorm and
you weren't?"</p>
<p>"We're both in the guilty. I was with him a lot. Maybe too much. Riley, I
mean, I brought
him to hang, though. I wanted you guys to
like him. To be happy for me." Willow's forehead was creased. She wanted to
speak, but was
holding back. "Go ahead, Will."</p>
<p>Willow set her carton on the coffee table, took a deep breath, and focused
on what she
wanted to say. "I was happy for you. I did set
you guys up, so I probably shouldn't even complain, but you weren't the
only one who was
jealous. You wanted me to like him so
badly, and then it was like 'all Riley all the time'.</p>
<p>"I started hanging out with Tara a lot because it seemed like you were too
wrapped up for
me. And there wasn't anything I could say
to you."</p>
<p>"Sure there was. This year was one change after another, and I got lost
somewhere along
the way. If you said something, anything, I
would've listened."</p>
<p>"Woulda, coulda, shoulda." Willow muttered.</p>
<p>"Exactly. But it's too late to change the past."</p>
<p>"True." Willow agreed. "Never again?"</p>
<p>"Never." Buffy said forcefully, and meant it.</p>
<p>Willow smiled, and outstretched her pinky finger. "Pinky swear."</p>
<p>"You can't be -" The resolve face was out in force, and the blonde quickly
stuck out her
finger. They intertwined, and Buffy
immediately thought of the next step.
"Where's this leave us now?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"This ice cream is going to melt." Willow observed. "Maybe we should put it
in the
freezer."</p>
<p>They walked into the kitchen, and Buffy took the cartons and put them in
the freezer. She
just hoped her mom wouldn't eat any. She
hopped up on the counter after finishing the task.</p>
<p>"What do you want to do, Will?" She asked finally. "This is big, I know. A
lot. But I
think you know how I feel. I guess being a slayer;
I've learned to trust in my dreams. And my instincts."</p>
<p>"That's important…instincts." She took Buffy's hand and was helped up next
to her on the
counter. "But there's factors…"</p>
<p>"Forget 'em for now. No Riley, no Tara. Just you and me."</p>
<p>Willow knew she had to choose her words carefully. "I've always loved you,
Buffy, you know
that. As a friend, a best-friend…"</p>
<p>"But not like…in a relationship way." Buffy said softly.</p>
<p>"I don't recall saying that. Did I say that?"</p>
<p>"Well…no…"</p>
<p>"I didn't think so. Now can I finish?"</p>
<p>"Sorry, Willow." Buffy had a lopsided grin on her face.</p>
<p>"Now as I was going to say, I wouldn't have thought of you in a
relationship way if I
hadn't met Tara. She showed me that it was,
okay, to love another girl that way." It suddenly dawned on her. "Maybe
that's why
she's…here or something. In our dreams and all."</p>
<p>"Whoa. What are you saying? That you think Tara's some 'knowing all' good
guy here to
bring us together?"</p>
<p>"Who knows? Maybe she was just watching the world one-day and decided she'd
help us out. I
can always feel how powerful she is
when I'm around her.
She's…different. Could be why I was drawn to her when I first saw
her.</p>
<p>"Or…I could be completely wrong."</p>
<p>"No. I think you're right. But you still haven't answered my question."
Just as Buffy said
that, the phone began to ring. "Ahh! Hang on."</p>
<p>She went to go answer it and Willow went back in the living room.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>It was about ten minutes later when Buffy walked into the room, and Willow
looked up.
Buffy looked like she had news.</p>
<p>"Everything okay?"</p>
<p>"Huh?" Buffy shook her head and parked herself on the floor. "Yeah, that
was Riley."</p>
<p>Willow maneuvered her way onto the floor as well. "And?"</p>
<p>"He said that he doesn't think he'll be coming back after break. Said he
might find a
local college or work on his family's farm. They're
not doing too good."</p>
<p>&nbsp;"I'm sure it had nothing to do with him not liking you." Willow
assured her.</p>
<p>"No, but I bet it had everything to do with the Hellmouth. After everything
he went
through, I can't blame him for wanting to stay
someplace safe. I mean, what could possibly be bad in Iowa?"</p>
<p>"Corn demons?" Willow offered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Buffy smirked. "Oh my god! Mutant kernels!"</p>
<p>"No matter how much butter you put on the popcorn -"</p>
<p>Willow stopped, and they stared at each other, soon erupting into a fit of
giggles. After
they calmed down and collected themselves,
they found that they were lying on their backs, side by side.</p>
<p>"He doesn't need me. She was right." Buffy said.</p>
<p>"Hmm?"</p>
<p>"Tara, in my dream, said that Riley didn't need me. He'll be okay. Happy.
He'll think of
me for awhile and then move on. Get a life, a
good job, might even get money for his service…while I'm here. Doing what I
always do.
Hey, but there's a bright side. There was no
disastrous breakup or death. That's a change."</p>
<p>"You're not upset? Or mad?"</p>
<p>"Why should I be mad? He did ask me to come out there. I said no. So we
said goodbye. No
hard feelings."</p>
<p>"Wait…he asked you to move out to Iowa?"</p>
<p>"Yep. But I can't leave. Hellmouth and all. And he knew I was going to say
no, anyway."</p>
<p>"What if this was just a normal town and he asked you to go? Would
you?"</p>
<p>"If you were still here, Xander, Giles…no way. Friendship is too
important."</p>
<p>Willow sighed in relief.</p>
<p>"Uh…Buffy?"</p>
<p>"Yesssss?" She drew out the word playfully.</p>
<p>"I've got another experiment."</p>
<p>Buffy turned her head. "Do you? Please share."</p>
<p>"I don't know if it's jumping the gun or not…but we'll need to do this if
we want to be
absolutely positive."</p>
<p>"About what?"</p>
<p>"Going…beyond friendship." Buffy simply smiled, and waited for Willow to
continue. "Now, I
think this'll work best in a sitting
position."</p>
<p>Buffy quickly complied. "I think I know what to do next."</p>
<p>She gently cupped the side of Willow's face with her hand, and without
hesitation, started
to lean in.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>When their lips met, it was like fitting two puzzle pieces together. Light,
feathery
kisses started the experiment. Around the corners of
their mouths, sweet, with no rush. And then it picked up. Willow was the
first to open her
mouth, and Buffy accepted the invitation
immediately. She was kissing Willow. Willow was kissing her. That's about
the only thought
she had. Well that, and, "why didn't I do
this before?"</p>
<p>Willow was having similar thoughts, as she put her hands around the blonde.
After a few
moments, they broke apart, eyes closed, not
moving an inch.</p>
<p>"I think the conclusions are in." Buffy said.</p>
<p>"Have to say that I'm pleased with the initial results." Willow grinned
happily.</p>
<p>"Initial?"</p>
<p>"For shame, Buffy! A good scientist always does multiple trials to try to
be as accurate
as possible."</p>
<p>"How silly of me. Does this mean you're with me on this?"</p>
<p>"I'd say…uh…yeah. Do you think we're jumping the gun?"</p>
<p>"No, I'd say we're following the bullet pretty well."</p>
<p>"That's good." Willow said, leaning in.</p>
<p>"Very good." Buffy confirmed, following suit. Then there was a loud banging
at the door.
"We don't want any." She began the kissing
once more.</p>
<p>"You gotta let me in, Slayer! I'm in trouble!" Spike yelled from the other
side of the
door.</p>
<p>"You shouldn't pick fights then." Willow said in between kisses.</p>
<p>"Red's in there too?"</p>
<p>"And we're kinda busy." Buffy said.</p>
<p>"They're vampires! You kill them remember?"</p>
<p>"It's my night off. Good luck though."</p>
<p>"You're not staking? You're just gonna let dangerous blood-sucking fiends
run loose?"</p>
<p>As the conversation has been going on, the kissing hadn't
stopped.</p>
<p>"They don't seem to be bothering anybody but you, Spike." Willow said,
nearing annoyance.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well…if I die, it'll be on your consciences."</p>
<p>"And I'm sure we'll be torn up inside." Buffy said with a hint of sarcasm.
"I might just
stake something tonight after all, now that I think
about it."</p>
<p>"Don't tell me you're still upset about that 'setting you up to get
slaughtered' bit. And
you can forget me helping you ever again, you
know."</p>
<p>They both turned their heads towards the door. "Go away, Spike!" They
yelled at him.</p>
<p>"Bloody hell!"</p>
<p>When they heard quickly retreating footsteps, they faced each other once
more.</p>
<p>"Where were we?" Buffy asked. "Oh. I remember now."</p>
<p>"Wait. I just want you to know…I love you. And I need you."</p>
<p>"Me too. Love, friendship…whatever you want, it's yours." Buffy thought.
"Isn't it funny
how things work out?"</p>
<p>Willow's answer was a kiss.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Tara watched the Summers' House from across the street, smiling. Her work
was done. For
now, anyway.</p>
