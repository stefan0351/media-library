<p>Three days had gone by since two best friends had remembered their past,
healed their
present, and took a step towards a new future. Afraid that they might have
dropped a few
rungs on the friendship ladder recently, they proved to each other just how
much having
one another in their lives meant. Then they had, almost seamlessly, moved
beyond that. To
something deeper. To the aforementioned, "new future".</p>
<p>Willow believed that they owed thanks to Tara, and they were both going to
do that, but
the redhead then realized that since freshman year was over, Tara was no
longer in her
dorm. And she had no idea where the shy blonde lived. They had tried
getting an address
through the college records, but there was none entered. Willow took that
as a sign that
her theory had been correct, and simply smiled. And somehow she knew that
Tara had
received her silent thanks. Wherever she was.</p>
<p>It was all so new, and very…nice. Sweet. The thing they realized they were
best at,
besides kissing, was cuddling. They liked to just lay down, or sit, and
hold each other.
They could be completely silent for hours, eyes closed, with their arms
around one
another. Then, reluctantly, they would have to stop. The world still had
bad things in it, still needed protecting.</p>
<p>Currently, it was night, and they were going to Xander's house. Willow had
accompanied
Buffy on patrol, and the total vampires slain had been only three. Summers
were always
quiet. They had apparently been the vampires that had been after Spike a
few days ago.
Willow recognized Spike's crypt as Buffy was taking care of the vampires,
and after the
slaying, they went inside and found it trashed and empty.</p>
<p>"Humph." Willow grumbled. "Not even a thank you. How rude."</p>
<p>"Maybe that was because we walked on him." Buffy thought happily.</p>
<p>Willow realized what Buffy meant. "You think they…poofed him?"</p>
<p>The blonde shook her head. "No. And I hate to admit this, but he's too
smart to put
himself in a position to be dusted."</p>
<p>"The only one who ever got close enough is you."</p>
<p>Buffy grinned, and drew out a sigh. "It's what happens when you're the
best. And when
you've got something Spike never had."</p>
<p>"What's that?" Willow asked, smiling.</p>
<p>"Friends. And a reason to want to win." She tightened her grip on Willow's
hand, and used
her other hand to encircle Willow's waist.</p>
<p>Willow felt a calm feeling wash over her body. Every time Buffy touched or
hugged her, she just…it all just went away. Everything. It had always been that way. If she
was sad,
upset, worried, Buffy could make it better. But as Buffy held her now, she
wasn't taking
her from sad to happy. She was taking her from happy to really happy.
Willow loved this,
loved her.</p>
<p>As Buffy pulled her close, and they continued walking, she had to remember
to keep working her legs. With the newness of their extended relationship, Willow had been
thinking one
thing lately, and she figured it was about time she voiced it
aloud.</p>
<p>"I never really got it before." Willow started off by saying.</p>
<p>"Got what?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"I always knew you were attractive, and funny, and smart, and nice, and
tough…and I could
see why Angel loved you, and Riley…but never really saw."</p>
<p>"And now?"</p>
<p>"Now? Now I do. I can't describe why I do, I just feel it. It's because
you're…you. But
you know what I've been wondering?"</p>
<p>"What?" Buffy asked, already feeling tears sliding down her
cheeks.</p>
<p>"How can anybody not love you?"</p>
<p>Buffy turned Willow around, and hugged her tightly. "God, Will.
That's…that's the nicest
thing anyone has ever…how can I top that?"</p>
<p>"It wasn't said so it could be topped. I said it because that's how I
feel."</p>
<p>"Well, I feel the same way. Being with you like this…I feel like the
luckiest slayer in
the world."</p>
<p>"That makes two of us then." Willow said in all seriousness. "I mean, I'm
not a
slayer…though I do know how a stake works…the pointy end goes -" She
decided it was best
to cut off the babble before it got too out of control to stop.</p>
<p>They broke the hug just enough so they could see the each other's
face.</p>
<p>"I need to kiss you right now."</p>
<p>"Hey, what a coincidence! I was thinking the same thing. About kissing you
I mean."</p>
<p>"So we're agreed? There's going to be kissing?"</p>
<p>"Sure as shootin'."</p>
<p>Two smiling pairs of lips began to meet.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Xander was sitting in his basement waiting on his friends' arrival. The
three of them had
made it a point to hang out as much as possible to make up for lost time.
Anya was looking into vengeance opportunities somewhere, and he didn't know when she'd be
back. Apparently
his "First Slayer Induced" dream had been right on target with that. He was
praying that
her ex-bosses wouldn't re-hire her. He really did love her, but he didn't
know if he could date someone whose job involved putting boils on male genitals.</p>
<p>Pushing away those thoughts for the moment, tonight he had something to
tell Buffy and
Willow. He had realized how pointless his job to job to job year had been,
and how little
he had accomplished. So he decided to take a risk that would give him a
shot at getting a
better job and possibly a more permanent one. He had signed up for summer
courses at UC
Sunnydale, which started in a week. He planned on taking the basic freshman
classes,
hoping to get enough credits to catch up to the girls.</p>
<p>His lack of self-esteem had kept him away from college, not thinking he
could make the
cut. But there was financial aid, and it wasn't like the college was
Harvard. The least he could do was try, and that's what he planned to do. He didn't want to be
labeled a
"direction-less loser". And more simply, he wanted to be able to be with
his friends,
because frankly, the basement didn't hold much appeal anymore.</p>
<p>Not like it ever really had any to begin with.</p>
<p>He heard a creak signifying that the door was opening. Then the sounds of
footsteps coming down the stairs made him smile. He noticed that Buffy and Willow were
holding hands, and
he thought he saw…something else. The handholding in itself wasn't very
unusual, but the
fact they didn't let go as they sat on the bed next to him, gave him
pause.</p>
<p>"What's up, Xand?" Buffy asked, cheerily.</p>
<p>"Yeah, tell us about your day. Inquiring slayers and wiccas want to know."
Willow said a
little too giddily.</p>
<p>Xander looked at his two friends' faces, a little concerned. "Okay, this is
me. Just tell
me where you hid the alcohol, and we can set up an AA meeting first thing
tomorrow. It's
never too late to change."</p>
<p>Buffy tried to look stern.&nbsp; "Ha. You almost made me think about
laughing." She said,
hitting sarcasm with…well, more sarcasm.</p>
<p>"So are you gonna tell us or not?" Willow pouted.</p>
<p>He took a breath. "You know, the usual. Looked at the walls, made shadow
puppets, enrolled in college…nothing big."</p>
<p>They were in a stunned silence for a moment before it hit them</p>
<p>"Nothing big? This is huge! Big Bird huge!" Willow exclaimed. Buffy and
Xander looked at
her quizzically. "I happen to have very fond memories of Sesame Street."
She defended
herself.</p>
<p>Buffy decided that a congratulatory hug was in order, and embraced Xander.
Willow waited
until Buffy was finished and took her turn.</p>
<p>"Good for you. Summer courses?" Buffy said.</p>
<p>"Yeah. We'll see what happens. Starts in a week."</p>
<p>"You can do it. We're all about support." Willow said.</p>
<p>"As only the Scooby Gang can provide." Buffy said with a smile. "This says
celebration to
me. I say we party."</p>
<p>"Bronze is closed tonight, Buff." Xander said. He saw that grin on the
blonde's face.
"What's going on up there?"</p>
<p>"Bronze isn't what I had in mind." Willow and Xander waited. "Still got
your Uncle Rory's
car?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. They extended his sentence. Why?"</p>
<p>"I think we've earned a break from the Hellmouth. Don't you
guys?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>They were on the road, and had just passed the Sunnydale entrance/exit
sign. When they
crossed that imaginary borderline, it felt like they had just escaped a
black hole. Xander was driving, because he was the only one licensed to do so, and Buffy and
Willow were in
the back. He saw them through the rearview mirror. Buffy had her arm
wrapped around
Willow.</p>
<p>"Are you sure this is a good idea, Buffy? Kinda impulsive." Willow
said.</p>
<p>"That's what spur of the moment ideas are, Will. Spontaneous, crazy…" Buffy
explained.</p>
<p>"Well, technically," Xander began, "a spur of the moment idea would just be
us getting in
a car and going somewhere without worrying about anything. Not stopping off
at your mom's
for a monetary supply, clothes, and keys to a beach house."</p>
<p>"Yeah, well…" She stuck her tongue out at him, and Willow was trying hard
not to notice.
Buffy realized what she was thinking, and quickly retracted her tongue.
"Hey, we could've
gone and not had a place to stay or money to eat. Besides, mom said she
never used the
house, and that somebody should. It's the one thing my dad let her
have."</p>
<p>"Nuh uh. He let her have you too." Willow said, smiling at her.</p>
<p>"Which we're very glad for. Or I would've been pushing up daisies long
ago." Xander added.<BR><BR></p>
<p>Buffy smiled at Xander first and then down at Willow. Then she reached her
hand over and
gently started to run her fingers through the redhead's hair. Willow knew
her eyes were
closing.</p>
<p>"Think we should have invited Giles?" She asked Buffy.</p>
<p>"I called him before we left mom's. He said he had things he needed to do."
The blonde
shrugged. "Told us to have a good time though. And not to worry about
hurrying back."</p>
<p>"I don't know about you gals, but I plan to take advantage of my youth and
par-tay down."</p>
<p>"I'm with him."</p>
<p>"And I'm with you." Willow whispered.</p>
<p>Feeling pretty damn good about themselves, they continued their drive to
Santa Cruz.
Despite the somewhat lengthy distance to cover, they knew that the next
week was going to
be the most fun they'd had together in awhile, and would probably be the
last chance to
kick back for awhile too. So they intended to make it count.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>They entered the city of Santa Cruz at around two in the morning. Xander
had the radio
going. An all "Songs of the Beach" station. The Beach Boys were singing
"Good Vibrations", and Xander was getting into to it as well. As he cruised the car looking
for the right
street, he sang right along with the band.</p>
<p>"I, I love the colorful clothes she wears…and the way the sunlight plays
upon her hair…I
hear the sound of a gentle word…on the wind that lifts her perfume through
the air…I'm
pickin' up good vibrations…she's giving me excitations -"</p>
<p>Willow made a shushing sound. "It's two in the morning! And Buffy's
sleeping."</p>
<p>He turned down the music, and looked back. Buffy was curled up in the seat
lying with her
head on Willow's lap. He still couldn't put his finger on it, but something
was going on
with the two girls.</p>
<p>"Our little slayer's all tuckered out. I'm just getting into it, you know?
Summer fun,
beaches, boardwalk, three young-type adults wild and fancy-free for a
week…"</p>
<p>Willow knew how he felt, and smiled at him. Her excitement was a little
more contained
however. For now, she was just trying to stay awake so she could help
Xander navigate. She saw a side street coming up. "I think this is it."</p>
<p>"Laguna Street?" Xander questioned.</p>
<p>"Yep."</p>
<p>Xander turned onto the street and tried to make out the house
numbers.
"Come on twelve…come on twelve…bingo." He pulled into the driveway and
turned off the
engine. Looking at the house, there was one thing he noticed. "Ooh. Jacuzzi
on the deck."
He leered.</p>
<p>Willow simply shook her head, and began to try and wake Buffy up.</p>
<p>"We're here, Buffy."</p>
<p>"Don't wanna." Buffy said in a little girl voice, still asleep. "Santa's
stupid.&nbsp; I don't
wanna sit on his lap."</p>
<p>Willow and Xander had to cover their mouths to keep from
laughing.</p>
<p>"Why not?" He had to ask.</p>
<p>"Cause…cause…he's fat…and a fake…never eats my cookies…and…I hate him."
Then her eyes shot open, surprising her friends. "And he spies on people when they're
sleeping."</p>
<p>They cleared their throats, and Xander began to gather their fast food bags
to take into
the house to throw away. Buffy sat up, and Willow's face was as red as her
hair.</p>
<p>"Spying? That's wrong. Spying is bad. Santa should be arrested.
That's…that's why I'm
Jewish. He's a lawbreaker. Bad." Willow attempted to get off the hook, but
simply dug
herself deeper.</p>
<p>"We're caught, Will." Xander said, exiting the car.</p>
<p>Buffy remained expressionless. She fished around in her pocket for a few
seconds, and then pulled out the house keys and smiled.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Inside, they laid the suitcases and bags down by the door. There were
carpeted steps
leading up to the second floor. They looked down the hallway. First there
was a closet, a
bathroom, a room with a washer and dryer, followed by two bedrooms. They
all walked down
the hall, and peered in. One was a single bed, and other bedroom was
larger, enough for
two people.</p>
<p>"The single was supposed to be for me, and the double was supposed to be
for my parents.
Let's just say we never got around to coming here. Family and vacations
were not words in
my vocabulary as a kid." Buffy tried to say jokingly, but didn't quite pull
it off.</p>
<p>"Well, leave that up to us, Buff." Xander said. "By the time this week's
over we'll
redefine 'vacation'."</p>
<p>"And I think we've got the 'family' part covered already." Willow
said.</p>
<p>"Come 'ere, you two."</p>
<p>Xander never passed up a hug opportunity. They separated, but Buffy still
held Willow
close.</p>
<p>"K, Willow and I'll take the double. Girls only, Xandman." Buffy told
him.</p>
<p>Xander held up his hands. "You're the boss. But I'm too hyped. I'm gonna
check out
upstairs."</p>
<p>"Suit yourself." Willow yawned. "But the redhead and I are
pooped."</p>
<p>He was already rushing upstairs. They watched him go, and walked to their
bedroom, turned
on the ceiling fan light, and shut the door. Buffy walked Willow back to
the bed, and
gently pushed her down on the mattress. Willow was about to say something,
but she was
stopped by the blonde's finger on her lips. She couldn't help but
smile.</p>
<p>Buffy, her touch so light Willow could barely feel it, traced her friend
and nearly
lover's lips with her finger.</p>
<p>"Do you have any idea how much I love you right now?" Willow shook her
head.
"No? That only leaves one option then."</p>
<p>"Yeah?" Willow said quietly, though with a grin.</p>
<p>Buffy nodded. "I have to show you. That is…if you…"</p>
<p>"I do." Willow bit her lip. "It's not like…I haven't thought about
it…uh…before."</p>
<p>Buffy leaned down and whispered. "So have I."</p>
<p>"Xander?"</p>
<p>"Five bucks he's on the couch asleep already. But we'll check in the
morning."</p>
<p>"In the morning." Willow agreed as Buffy replaced her finger with her
mouth.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Xander awoke in the morning with a stiff neck, feeling the sun's rays hit
him from through the sliding glass doors that led out to the large deck. He sat up with a
yawn, trying to
massage the kinks out with his hand. He hadn't remembered the last time he
had woken up in such a bright place before. It was certainly a change from the basement. He
felt energized already.</p>
<p>By his keen powers of deduction, and ability to see the clock on the wall,
it was just
past ten AM. Standing, and suddenly realizing how hungry he was, he walked
past the
counter into the small kitchen. Checking the cupboards and the fridge, he
noticed a
recurring problem. There was no food. At all.</p>
<p>He was a male in his prime. Eating was an extreme necessity. Plus, there
was something
about the sea air that made anyone just a little bit more hungry than
usual. There had to
be a supermarket around somewhere. He could take the car and be back
before…he remembered
he didn't know where the money was. And he only had thirty bucks on him.
But Buffy knew
where the "vacation fund" was.</p>
<p>Now came the internal debate. Buffy wasn't fun first thing in the morning.
Did he want to
risk getting a concussion by waking her and asking where the cash
was?
Yes. Because, and he hated to admit this, but if ate another Egg McMuffin,
he was going to be violently ill. He walked down the stairs, and quietly up to Buffy and
Willow's bedroom
door.</p>
<p>He knocked softly, and was somewhat surprised when Buffy
answered.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" She asked.</p>
<p>Xander opened the door and started to speak.</p>
<p>"There's nothing eatable in the house and I wanted to go get some food, but
I didn't know
where -" He stopped himself when he focused on the sight before
him.</p>
<p>His two friends were lying in bed, covered by blankets. Only they were very
close
together, and he guessed that they were absent any type of clothing under
those layers of
fabric. Buffy was looking at Willow, who was still asleep with her head
resting on Buffy's shoulder, and running her fingers through the wiccan's red hair.</p>
<p>She looked up at him. "Red suitcase. Second pouch. It's all in an
envelope."</p>
<p>Took him a second to figure out that she was talking to him.
"Uh…huh?"</p>
<p>"You're looking for the money, right?"</p>
<p>"Oh…yeah. Thanks."</p>
<p>"Try to be diverse in your food choices?"</p>
<p>"Uh huh. I'll just…go…do that now." He backed out of the room, and shut the
door. He stood there looking at it for a second, and then went to get the money.
"Deep breaths…deep breaths..." He kept repeating to himself.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"You told him to come in?" Willow asked about an hour later. They were
lounging on the
deck waiting for Xander's return. "Just like that?"</p>
<p>They were sitting on a cushioned, somewhat reclining deck chair. Willow was
conserving
chairs by sitting on Buffy's lap. She was rather distraught at the fact
that Xander had
discovered them like that. And that Buffy had just…</p>
<p>"They're just two words, Will. Not very hard to say." Buffy said
sarcastically.</p>
<p>"You're joking? This isn't jokable."</p>
<p>"Relax, will ya? He was gonna find out sooner or later." Willow eyed her
and she broke
into a grin. "And maybe I wanted to mess with him a little."</p>
<p>"Buffy!" Willow exclaimed in a shocked tone.</p>
<p>"It'll be okay, jeez." She tried to soothe her friend, and now lover, with
a kiss.</p>
<p>"You can't do that. It doesn't work."</p>
<p>"Oh no?" Buffy asked, having a very good way to settle that. But then she
saw Xander pull
up. "I'm gonna help him with the bags. Be back."</p>
<p>She slid out from underneath Willow. She could see the redhead didn't want
her to get up,
and the sad eyes almost worked. She went to the edge of the deck, and swung
herself over
the railing, landing on her feet in the gravel driveway. Xander raised his
eyebrows,
impressed. Willow, who was still up on the deck, called down.</p>
<p>"Show off!"</p>
<p>Xander and Buffy watched her walk away. He stood by the car, leaning
back.</p>
<p>"Need any help?" She asked.</p>
<p>Willow then walked out, and up to the two of them. They all stood in
silence for a few
moments before Xander decided to speak up.</p>
<p>"Okay…I only have one request."</p>
<p>"Xander, listen we -" Willow started to say, but she was shushed.</p>
<p>"Please tell me that you're sticking with this. Now, considering my
girlfriend is an
ex-demon currently trying to become one again, this is pretty normal. And
all I'm gonna
say is that I hope you two are happy." They smiled at him. "But, you've
gotta start to
give me warnings. A guy needs time to get his fantasies straight.
Er…uh…"</p>
<p>They attempted glares and starting stalking towards him. That's when he
reached into his
car, and quickly pulled out a Super Soaker. He aimed it at that them, and
they stopped
dead in their tracks.</p>
<p>"Don't you dare." Buffy warned.</p>
<p>"Always come prepared. That's my motto." He said, ignoring the slayer's
threat.</p>
<p>Then he fired, and they started to run. His aim was dead on. Super Soakers
got great
distance. No matter where they ran in the yard, he hit them. By the time he
ran out of
water, both girls hair was drenched, as well as their shirts.</p>
<p>"So…who's gonna help me with the food?" He asked nervously.</p>
<p>"Oh…we will." Willow said with a "the tables have turned" smile on her
face.</p>
<p>He decided to push his luck. "You had to wear dark colored shirts, didn't
you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you are so dead." Buffy promised.</p>
<p>Dropping the gun, he took off inside the house. But they were right behind
him.</p>

<p>Eventually, they had gotten Xander cornered on the deck. Deciding he had
been scared
enough, the girls called off the lynching. The three of them then brought
in the bags of
groceries, and immediately began to cure their hunger. Xander had already
dug into the
chips, but Buffy was making ham and cheese sandwiches by the counter.
Willow sat next to
Xander at the dining table, trying to find things they could do.</p>
<p>"Boardwalk is our best shot." Willow said.</p>
<p>"Mayo or mustard?" Buffy asked her friends as she prepared to apply one of
the condiments.<BR></p>
<p>"Mustard." Came the echoed answer.</p>
<p>"Guess I'm the only one who likes the white goodness that is mayonnaise,
then." She
feigned a hurt expression. "And yeah, the boardwalk's got that huge
amusement park."</p>
<p>"I'll have mayo too." Willow said, just to see Buffy smile. It
worked.</p>
<p>Xander rolled his eyes and grabbed the brochure as soon as Willow set it
down.
"Ooh. A roller coaster! And min-golf! And bowling!"</p>
<p>Buffy came to the table and placed lunch in front of her friends. As she
sat down, she had
an amused smile on her face that was directed at Xander. "I may have
devolved with beer,
but he can do it without any help at all. Amazing talent you have there,
Xander."</p>
<p>"Oh like you're Miss Maturity." Xander retorted.</p>
<p>Willow just sat, eating her sandwich, and watched as Buffy got her "I've
got wicked idea"
grin on her face.</p>
<p>"We'll see who's mature."</p>
<p>The blonde got up off the chair, and walked over to Willow. She took her
new girlfriend's
hand, and Willow wordlessly stood. Buffy watched Xander's face closely. He
was
unsuccessfully pretending to be focused on eating, but in obvious truth, he
was watching
his friends intently.</p>
<p>"Buffy, what -" Willow began.</p>
<p>"Just gonna do a little experiment, Will."</p>
<p>"But the last time we -" Her eyes bugged out, but she stayed silent, and
grinned inwardly.</p>
<p>"Now. Xander, you're fine with us being together, and believe me when I say
I'm glad. This
is something we want, and you not flipping out is a happy bonus. However,
don't think that
I don't know what you're thinking."</p>
<p>"Um…okay." He choked out.</p>
<p>"You're imagining every possible scenario between Will and I right now,
aren't you?"</p>
<p>"Possibly."</p>
<p>"That's immature right there. I can't get mad, well, because it's a guy
thing. But what I
don't understand, is why. I mean, if we, say, kissed right now, would you
object?"</p>
<p>"Not as such, no." There were beads of sweat running down his face, and his
throat was now
a tad dry.</p>
<p>Willow surprised the both of them by kissing Buffy. Not very long, but a
full-fledged
locking of the lips nonetheless. She looked at the friend she'd known since
childhood, and
his mouth was now agape.</p>
<p>"He's going to overload. Fantasies just raised a little too, I think.
Immaturity level
seems to be maxed out. It was because we gave him a visual reference."
Willow said in her
best scientist voice.</p>
<p>Buffy touched her lips. "As enjoyable as that was for me, wouldn't you
rather have been
the one doing the kissing?"</p>
<p>It took a second for him to answer; he had to move his jaw a few
times.
"Uh…yeah. But will I ever get that opportunity?" Two shaking heads answered
his question.
"Then to be realistic, imagining two females…you know…is an enjoyable
alternative."</p>
<p>He stood, walked past them a ways, and turned back around. "And if you ask
me, it's pretty
immature to manipulate someone's hormones in such a nasty way. Now, if
you'll excuse me, I
have to go to the bathroom now."</p>
<p>Xander headed down the steps quicker than usual.</p>
<p>"Revenge." Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"Gotta love it." Willow said, finishing Buffy's thought.</p>
<p>The slayer and hacker couldn't help but burst into a giggle fit.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"I still say it's impossible, Wesley."</p>
<p>Giles had been sitting at home reading Anne Rice's latest and drinking tea
when his fellow
ex-watcher called from LA. The younger man had first called him two days
before, very
concerned. When Wesley had calmed down and Giles had heard the cause for
his concern, he
had become somewhat alarmed as well. But the fact of the matter was that it
was still
highly unlikely.</p>
<p>"I know it's a bit of a stretch, but prophecies are almost always
fulfilled."</p>
<p>Giles stood and walked to his kitchen. He felt the need for the soothing
effects of tea.
"But this prophecy was never recorded. It came straight from his mouth. A
vampire's mouth.
Forgive me if I don't find him credible."</p>
<p>"He's nearly a thousand years old, Giles. A Master Vampire."</p>
<p>"Today, yes, he would have been. But he died two-hundred and fifty years
ago."</p>
<p>Giles began to boil some water.</p>
<p>"Supposedly. I know the story." Wesley said. "The Master, whom Buffy killed
four years
ago, was in Germany around 1750. Only he wasn't called the Master at that
point. No one
knows what his actual name was. He was old, about 450 years at the time. He
challenged
Krischten, who was the ruler over those parts, and had earned a Master
title at 850 years
old."</p>
<p>"Right. And then in a feat of almost David and Goliath proportions,
Krischten was killed,
'The Master' was placed in control, and followed. All the way to the
Americas, where he
tried to open the Hellmouth and failed. What's your point?"</p>
<p>The teakettle went off, whistling.</p>
<p>"His prophecy was that he would return in the new millennium after the
Master perished."
Wesley pointed out.</p>
<p>"There's something else, isn't there?" Giles asked.</p>
<p>He poured the water into a cup, and stuck a teabag inside. He started
mixing it up as he
went to sit back down.</p>
<p>"He hunts slayers first, and…" Wesley took a deep breath. "About an hour
ago,
Angel went to county lockup and found the bars torn clean off of Faith's
cell."</p>
<p>"And Faith?"</p>
<p>"Huddled in the corner, bruised and bloody. He didn't get to kill her,
because he was
interrupted by the cops on duty, and their gunshots. She was taken to the
hospital. Faith
isn't a threat to him, and I think he knows that, so he probably won't
return."</p>
<p>"So you think that -?"</p>
<p>"He may be going after Buffy. Angel's already trying to track her, but it
would help if -"</p>
<p>"She didn't tell me where they were going. Something about 'spur of the
moment'. And her
mother is out of town." Giles said helplessly.</p>
<p>"Buffy's…very resourceful." Wesley tried to comfort.</p>
<p>"Yes, I know. But if it is truly Krischten Taelano, then…" He drank his
newly made tea in
one gulp, ignoring the burning sensation in his mouth. "When Angel finds
them, call me
immediately."</p>
<p>He hung up, and sat quietly and nervously, waiting for it to ring
again.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>On the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and Amusement Park, three friends looked
up at a
magnificent sight. The Giant Dipper. A seventy-six year old wooden roller
coaster. Speed
was fifty-five miles per hour. Roller coaster enthusiasts considered it one
of the best
coasters on the West Coast. It dipped, it turned, dropped, and curved.
Buffy and Xander's
eyes were glazed over in anticipation as they moved through the line.
Willow's, however,
were not.</p>
<p>"It'll be fun." Buffy swore.</p>
<p>Willow shook her head vehemently. "No, no, no. Dangerous. Scary. The
Carousel is fun. Why
don't we do that instead?"</p>
<p>"She's always been coaster phobic." Xander said sadly.</p>
<p>"Well, it's time we changed that." Buffy said, now with a
purpose.</p>
<p>They were almost to the front.</p>
<p>"Change is bad." Willow looked at Buffy. "Okay, maybe not all
change…but…it's wood. Wood
breaks. Then there's plummeting."</p>
<p>"You're not getting out of this, Will." Buffy handed the man their tickets.
"Besides,
Xander and I'll be right beside you."</p>
<p>"Maybe I'm not tall enough." Willow tried scrunching down.</p>
<p>"I didn't want to have to do this, but you leave me no choice." Buffy
turned to Xander.
"I'll get her arms, you get her feet."</p>
<p>They picked her up, and placed her in the car, much to her protest. After
the ride was
over, Willow didn't want to get out.</p>
<p>"Wow." Willow felt energized, alive. "Wow. I wanna do it again."</p>
<p>"Sorry miss, you'll have to get in the back of the line." The man
said.</p>
<p>"But…but…the line's too long." She protested.</p>
<p>Buffy and Xander looked at each other.</p>
<p>"I'll get her arms this time." He volunteered.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Willow on an adrenaline high was an interesting thing to see. She dragged
her friends to
every fast-paced ride on the boardwalk. They went on the Hurricane, the
other, more modern
coaster. Then they rode the Tsunami, which launched them forward and then
backwards, very
quickly. After several others, Xander and Buffy regretted ever introducing
Willow to
"thrill rides".</p>
<p>It was just getting dark now, and the redhead showed no signs of slowing
down. They ended
up at Sector 7 Laser Tag. Buffy made her promise that they would go back to
the house
afterwards. Willow grudgingly agreed. Suited up now, with special vests and
laser guns,
they realized that they had the arena all to themselves. They would be
trying to take each
other down.</p>
<p>There was music pulsing all around them. Soft glowing neon lights were the
only things
letting them see. Other than that, it was completely dark inside. There
were barriers all
around, and they each positioned themselves waiting for the buzzer to go
off so they could
start the hunt. Buffy got an adrenaline rush herself, suddenly feeling a
chill as she
barely heard the buzzer over the heavy music.</p>
<p>Shaking it off, she began the search for her opponents. Ducking and
crouching behind any
barrier she came across, she figured that she had the advantage because her
slayer vision
was well adapted to the dark. She saw a figure move. It was Xander. She
grinned. It was
just too easy. She was about to move when she thought she caught a glimpse
of red hair.</p>
<p>Could they be double-teaming her?</p>
<p>As quickly as she saw it, it vanished. Playing it safe by sticking to the
walls, she
backed herself into a corner. That's when she felt it again. The chill. She
looked up, and
definitely saw red hair. But it wasn't Willow. Not by a long shot. Before
she could react,
the figure was swooping down on her, knocking her to the ground. She
couldn't see a thing.
Then the pain started.</p>
<p>Over near the other side of the arena, Xander scored a hit against Willow.
As he was
celebrating, she zapped him in return. They both held up their hands in
temporary
surrender. Xander had to practically scream over the noise.</p>
<p>"Where's Buffy? She should have whooped us by now!"</p>
<p>Willow began scanning the room. "I don't know! But I can't see
anything!"</p>
<p>They looked at each other, and quickly took off the heavy vests. Then they
began the
search. It was almost impossible, and the dread was going full force now.
Willow stood
still, and cleared her mind. Tara had taught her a locator spell. All she
had to do was
focus on a name, and with Buffy's supernatural abilities, she was pretty
easy to pick up.</p>
<p>"This way! He's hurting her!" She screamed.</p>
<p>"Who?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know!"</p>
<p>He followed her, and finally they caught sight of a figure, crouching. But
they didn't see
Buffy. Whoever it was, he was wearing a long leather jacket, and had
flowing, red hair.
Even from their vantage point, they could see how muscular he was. Xander
ran up to the
guy, and yanked on his jacket. The figure turned his head sharply, and
stared at Xander
with piercing blue eyes. Then he focused on Willow for a few
seconds.</p>
<p>Finally, they were able to see Buffy, and the man had disappeared, leaving
the slayer on
the ground. Willow ran up to her, and bent down, seeing Buffy as she had
never seen her
before. Beaten. Bloody. And in all around bad shape. She gasped, and then
the lights went
out completely. Just as they were about to totally freak, the whole arena
lit up. No more
music or dim lighting.</p>
<p>The attendants ran in, and they helped Buffy up. She struggled out of their
grips though,
and practically clung to her friends for support. She craned her neck and
whispered to
Willow what was on all their minds.</p>
<p>"What the hell was that?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Angel was pushing so hard on the gas pedal of his car, that with a little
more pressure,
he would have made a hole in the floor. He glanced up at his speedometer.
It was pushing
one hundred and twenty, but it still wasn't fast enough. He reached for his
cell phone and
hit auto dial.</p>
<p>"I know where they…I'm almost there…no, Giles can't do them any good, I'll
get them
out…just tell him to start researching. They're gonna need it."</p>
<p>He hung up to eliminate further argument. He was about five miles away from
Santa Cruz.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Willow walked into the bedroom, and knelt by the bed, which Buffy was
currently laying in.
The slayer had a moist cloth over her forehead, and touched her cut chin.
The rest of her
face was bruised, as were her ribs. Willow gently removed the cloth and
grimaced at the
gash that had been hidden under there.</p>
<p>"You should have stayed in the hospital overnight." Willow admonished,
reaching for a
bandage on the bedside bureau.</p>
<p>"And been a sitting duck? The guy was a vamp. He had to be. Nothing human
can do what he
did. Point is, he could have strolled right in."</p>
<p>"That's just an excuse. Super healer or not -"</p>
<p>"I would have had to blow the vacation money just to pay the
bill."</p>
<p>Willow carefully applied the bandage, but Buffy still winced a
little.</p>
<p>"Sorry. Forget the vacation. He almost killed you. I don't want you
dead."</p>
<p>She gripped Willow's arm. "But he didn't. I'm living. And until I'm not,
vacation is on."
She crossed her arms over her chest.</p>
<p>Buffy was way too stubborn. Instead of telling her that like she wanted to,
Willow tried a
kiss for comfort. She took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"You need anything?"</p>
<p>"Bottle of aspirin?"</p>
<p>Willow forced a smile. "Be right back. Don't move."</p>
<p>Buffy rolled her eyes, but smiled nonetheless. "Thanks, Will. Love
you."</p>
<p>"Love you too, Buffy."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Willow trudged upstairs. No matter what Buffy said, she knew their vacation
was shot. And
there were so many things they didn't get to do, too. She guessed they
should be thankful
that they all had gotten two days at least. Any amount of time that they
remained
evil-free they should be grateful for. But this vampire, or whatever,
really wigged her.
They were hours away from the Hellmouth, and it came all the way to Santa
Cruz to go after
Buffy. Not good.</p>
<p>She saw Xander on the couch, staring at the TV, as she went to look through
the cabinets
for some aspirin. He turned his head, saw her, and quickly made his way
over. He sat
himself down on a stool that was in front of the counter.</p>
<p>"How is she?"</p>
<p>"Not a hundred percent, but well enough to be 'Stubborn Buffy'." Willow
answered, thinking
she wouldn't mind some aspirin either.</p>
<p>She snatched a bottle and set it down. Grabbing a glass, she went to the
sink at filled it
up with water. She uncapped the Advil bottle, and downed two pills, sighing
and closing
her eyes.</p>
<p>"Doesn't want to end the summer fun, huh?" Xander asked. Willow shook her
head. "Well,
while you went to the hospital with her, I packed everything up. It's gonna
be fine." He
grabbed her hand and squeezed.</p>
<p>She smiled. "I know…I mean, we've been through worse, right? But
now…"</p>
<p>"You're feeling worry on a whole new level. I know what it's like. Boy do
I."</p>
<p>"We have to convince her to go," She put her resolve face on, "but first I
better go give
her this. Or else -"</p>
<p>Willow interrupted herself when they both heard a knock. Coming the sliding
glass doors.
She looked at Xander with the same questioning expression he was giving
her, as they
walked over to investigate. It was dark out, so they couldn't see much of
anything. It
didn't look like there was anything out on the deck.</p>
<p>"Are you going to let me in?" Angel's voice asked.</p>
<p>Which was why that made them practically jump out of their skins. Willow
opened the door,
and sure enough, the brooding vampire stood there. And her worry for Buffy
increased a
whole heck of a lot.</p>
<p>"Angel, hi." She greeted half-heartedly. "Come in."</p>
<p>Xander shook his head once Angel stepped in. "Don't you ever use the front
door?"</p>
<p>"Is she here?" Angel asked.</p>
<p>"Downstairs. Resting." Willow told him.</p>
<p>"He got to her. Damn it."</p>
<p>"What's going on, Angel? Who is he?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, fill us in, Deadboy." Xander smiled. "Forgot how much I liked saying
that."</p>
<p>Angel ignored both of them and went right for the steps. "We have to go
now. Anything you
brought, hurry and get it in my car. The quicker we are, the better chance
we have of
staying alive."</p>
<p>"Or in your case -" Angel shot him a look, just as he opened the door to
the bedroom.
"I'll just pack it…oh wait. I can't leave my car here. It's a whole, cop,
uncle's a felon,
car might be stolen kinda deal."</p>
<p>Buffy shot up when she saw Angel, and started to flip.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"No way. This is supposed to be a happy time. I'm going to pretend you're
not here, and
you'll disappear." Buffy shut her eyes. "He gone yet?" She asked her
friends, slowly
opening an eye.</p>
<p>"There's no time, Buffy." Angel said forcefully. "He already tested you and
won. He'll
come back."</p>
<p>"Who?" Three voices asked in unison.</p>
<p>"A very old, master vampire."</p>
<p>Buffy looked at him like he'd gone nuts. "I killed him remember? Smashed
his bones? I seem
to recall something about 'making bread'…"</p>
<p>Xander raised his hand. "That was me."</p>
<p>"It's not the same…look, it's complicated. He'll kill you. That's why he's
here. Trust me,
I wouldn't be here otherwise." Angel tried again.</p>
<p>Buffy sighed and shook her head sadly. It was so unfair. She couldn't get
one week of
peace? She felt Willow pulling up the blankets, and turning her around. She
looked up
apologetically.</p>
<p>"We can have tons of fun back home, right? Only with more weapons. And
these last two
days...we haven't had that much fun in so long." Willow assured
her.</p>
<p>"A good time was had by all." Xander agreed. "And it's not like we'll never
do this again.
Well, if you -"</p>
<p>"If I die." Buffy stated.</p>
<p>"Well it would put a damper on future vacations." Xander
admitted.</p>
<p>"Which is what we're trying to prevent, by leaving now." Willow proceeded
to help the
blonde to her feet. Buffy fell back onto the bed. "Okay, little problem
here."</p>
<p>"Hold it." Buffy emphasized that request by raising her hands. "Angel, I'll
go with you.
Will, you ride with Xander. Xander, the stuff?"</p>
<p>"On it." Xander said, rushing out of the room.</p>
<p>Willow was getting ready to protest, but Buffy stopped her, and pulled her
into a hug. "I
know you want to be with me. I want you there too, but I'm what this vamp
wants, and that
means I want you to be as far away from me as possible. I'll be
okay."</p>
<p>The redhead nodded into Buffy's chest. She could never argue logic.
Besides, Angel would
be right there. By her side. Where she wanted to be. Her distress was
clearly visible on
her face. Buffy cupped her cheek.</p>
<p>"Turn around." The blonde said to Angel.</p>
<p>He must have, because in the next second, Willow felt Buffy's lips pressing
to hers. And
she didn't want to stop. But they had to. Buffy stared at her with so much
love, that
Willow thought she was going to faint. They separated, and Angel scooped
Buffy up so he
could carry her into the car.</p>
<p>"You better be behind us the whole way." Buffy said to her, ignoring the
awkward position
she was currently in.</p>
<p>"Even if we have to break every law of driving in the state of California."
Willow swore.
"And you stay alive." She looked at Angel, shaking her finger. "And you,
you keep her that
way."</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, they went out to the cars.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy glanced into the rearview mirror to make sure Xander was still behind
them and
keeping up. Angel was speeding a long at a good pace. Thankfully, there
weren't many cars
on the road at eleven thirty at night. They were on a highway, cliffs on
the right, beach
past a guardrail, on the left. He turned and looked at her briefly, with a
concerned
expression she knew all too well. He probably reserved that specific one
just for her.</p>
<p>"Are you upset?" He asked finally.</p>
<p>"Hell yeah. But not because of you. So don't flatter yourself."</p>
<p>"I never thought that you -"</p>
<p>"Yes you did." She moved to run her hands through her hair, but brushed up
against her
bandaged gash instead. After she bit her lip to hold back a curse, she
remembered who had
bandaged it. "I'm upset with myself. Who was I to think that I could have a
small vacation
with friends? Just cause I averted a couple apocalypses, I think I can
slack? How stupid
of me."</p>
<p>"Are you and Willow -?"</p>
<p>"Just concentrate on the road."</p>
<p>He'd try a different topic then. "Buffy, you could have been training and
preparing for
weeks to face him, and that still wouldn't have been enough. He's not big
on conversation,
unless he has a reason, and he's not out in the open. But he does like to
play."</p>
<p>"That supposed to make me feel better?" She asked sarcastically. "Did you
know him?"</p>
<p>Angel shook his head. "He disappeared, well, 'died', a few years before I
was changed."</p>
<p>"So all you've heard are stories. That may not be true. I'm not even going
to bother
asking about the 'dead' thing."</p>
<p>"Let me put it this way. In 1705, the Watcher's Council decided to launch
an offensive
against him. It was the only time they ever broke protocol and brought the
slayer at the
time, together with the ones in training around the world. They had all the
weapons
available at the time, and the odds."</p>
<p>"How many slayers?"</p>
<p>"Thirty. Maybe forty. Plus ten watchers who were giving the
orders."</p>
<p>"And how many stooges did this Master Vamp guy have?"</p>
<p>"None."</p>
<p>Buffy's eyes widened, and she cleared her throat. "I don't want to know the
ending, do
I?"&nbsp; Angel stayed quiet. "What's his name?"</p>
<p>"Krischten Taelano."</p>
<p>As he was turning to stay with the curve of the road, a figure appeared on
the cliff side,
almost out of nowhere. It walked right into the middle of the highway, and
turned to face
Angel's speeding car. It was him. Krischten stood there staring at them,
the bright glow
of the headlights and the oncoming car they were attached to, not seeming
to bother him at
all.</p>
<p>"Stop!" Buffy screamed.</p>
<p>The car screeched, and turned around one hundred and eighty degrees before
coming to a
halt. Buffy and Angel looked to make sure they were both all right, and
knew there was no
way they didn't hit the vampire.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Xander was going a little bit slower than Angel had been, so when he and
Willow came up on
the curve and saw Angel stopped a few feet up, they were able to stop
without causing an
accident. Willow was ready to jump out. Bad images were running through her
head. She felt
herself shiver as a chill coursed through her body. The weirdness of that
was muted by her
concern for Buffy.</p>
<p>"Why'd they stop?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>"The best way to get an answer is to -" Willow began, and then felt the
chill again.</p>
<p>Turning around, she saw him standing on the rear of the car.</p>
<p>The one from the Laser Tag arena.</p>
<p>The one after Buffy.</p>
<p>He looked at them. She checked the rearview mirror, and sure enough, he
wasn't there. She
tapped Xander on the shoulder, and he turned around and saw him too. Before
either of them
had time to react, the vampire, with faster speed than any they had ever
seen, grabbed the
back of Xander's head, and slammed it into the steering wheel. He was
out.</p>
<p>Willow screamed and then called her friend's name, but she was next. It
grabbed her neck,
and pulled her out of the car. It seemed almost less than second as he ran
across the road
with her in tow, and jumped over the guardrail. She was being dragged, and
felt the sand
of the beach as they moved downhill. Then, eventually, they
stopped.</p>
<p>It had yet to say a word. She tried to struggle, tried to remember a spell,
anything, but
it was no use. He let go of her neck, and his iron grip switched to the top
of her head.
She was being pushed down. After a few seconds, she couldn't move her legs;
could barely
feel them. Willow had no idea what was going on. And that's when she
realized something.</p>
<p>He was pushing her into the sand. She was sinking.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy saw Krischten for about a split second, but she knew he had Willow
with him. Filled
with panic and rage, she flung open her door, and ran out. She was still
stumbling because
of her injuries, but she told her body to knock it off. She looked back at
the other car,
and saw Xander unconscious. She started towards the guardrail, and then
Angel caught up
with her.</p>
<p>"Buffy, you're giving him what he wants. Let me go."</p>
<p>"You think you can do any better?" She asked him angrily. "Don't. I'm going
after her. I
need her, and she is not going to die. Even if I have to die to keep her
alive. Go help
Xander. He's hurt."</p>
<p>She cut off any more discussion, and ran with a renewed energy. The pain
was gone, at
least for now. She ran and hurled herself over the rail, but she wasn't
expecting the
change in surface, and hit the sand the wrong way. She ended up rolling
down the hill, and
when she came to a stop, she had to spit grains of sand out of her mouth.
She was on her
feet quickly, scanning the night.</p>
<p>Whether it was by sheer luck or an extension of her slayer powers, she got
an image of a
hand sticking out of the sand. Running, a couple feet later, she saw the
hand and
immediately knew whom it belonged to. Pulling with all the strength she
had, Willow slowly
emerged from beneath the sand. When Willow was at chest level, she gasped,
trying to suck
in air.</p>
<p>"Oh thank God. Are you okay?" Willow nodded, still not speaking. "Let's get
you all the
way out then. Whataya say?"</p>
<p>That's when Willow pointed at something, her arm shaking. Buffy turned her
head just in
time to see a boot connect with her face. She fell onto her back, and was
able to roll out
of the way quickly enough to avoid that same boot from crushing her chest.
Flipping up
onto her feet, she knew she had to move the fight away from Willow. So she
started to run
towards the water.</p>
<p>She reached the beginning of the wet, darker sand, when he appeared in
front of her, his
long red hair covering most of his face. But she could still see his
eyes.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Back a little bit, Willow was desperately trying to free herself from the
sand to go help
Buffy. It wasn't going too well. Then she saw a shadow looming over
her.</p>
<p>"Give me your hands." It was Angel.</p>
<p>Willow outstretched both of her arms, which Angel grabbed. In one swift
pull, she was
free, and he held her up while she learned how to move her legs
again.</p>
<p>"Is Xander okay?" She asked.</p>
<p>"I laid him down in the backseat and cleaned the cut on his forehead. He'll
be fine. I'm
going to help her."</p>
<p>"I'm going too."</p>
<p>"Figured you were going to say that. Come on."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Krischten threw the first punch, which she almost didn't block. After that,
it was
non-stop. All she could do was block. He was too fast, and she couldn't
knock him down.
She knew he was barely trying, and that pissed her off. Launching herself
into the air,
she made her legs perfectly straight, and then flipped backwards,
connecting with his chin
as she brought her legs around. When she landed, he was nowhere to be
seen.</p>
<p>That's when she felt something behind her. Bringing her elbow back, she was
satisfied when
she felt it connect. Before she could follow up though, she was being flung
into the air.
When she impacted with the ground, she felt the incoming tide hit her face.
Then her face
was being pushed into the sand. Hard.</p>
<p>"The girl is on her way here." He whispered to her, speaking for the first
time. "When I
saw her, I thought she might be family at first. Maybe a descendant. But
her scent was all
wrong. Though that can be easily changed."</p>
<p>Buffy kicked her leg up, throwing off his control. She shot up, and if he
was surprised,
he didn't show it. Her face was covered in wet sand, but her face was
burning. Her blood
was boiling. He was not going to hurt Willow anymore. Least of all drink
from her. Not
while she was still a breathing slayer.</p>
<p>Krischten smiled. Rather evilly too. It had gone well. "There's your fire.
The other one
has lost hers, but I had a feeling about you. We'll see each other again,
Slayer."</p>
<p>And literally, within a blink of her eyes, he was gone.</p>
<p>"Looking forward to it." Buffy muttered unenthusiastically.</p>
<p>Willow and Angel came running up, and the redhead knocked her back down to
the ground in
an embrace.</p>
<p>"You're alive!" Willow squealed, then she made a face. "But your face is
all mucky."</p>
<p>"Does this mean you don't love me anymore?" Buffy asked with a
pout.</p>
<p>"That's nonsense, Buffy Summers, and you know it! Course I do." Buffy
smiled.
"But I hope you don't think I'm gonna kiss you while you have 'icky sand
face'."</p>
<p>"Where'd he go?" Angel asked.</p>
<p>"Away." Buffy said as Willow helped them both up. "Which is fine by
me."</p>
<p>"Let's get you home."</p>
<p>Buffy suddenly remembered how much her body hurt.</p>
<p>"Loving that idea more every minute."</p>
<p>"I second that." Willow agreed.</p>
<p>The three of them trudged towards the road, two with their arms around each
other.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>A few hours later, back in Sunnydale, the sun was just about ready to come
up. They had
risked getting Xander's car towed back. After cleaning up the blood off the
steering wheel
to avoid the police, of course. Inside Giles', they all were asleep. Well,
everyone except
for Giles and Angel, who didn't want to let the three friends out of their
sight.</p>
<p>Out in the courtyard, two figures stood quietly, just watching the house.
One was an older
girl who looked to be around nineteen. Her companion was somewhat younger.
The older was
blonde, the other, black-haired. The younger seemed apprehensive.</p>
<p>"They're not ready for you yet." The blonde said.</p>
<p>"Well good. Cause I'm not ready for them either. This is just a little
scary, Tara."</p>
<p>"Relax. Everything will be fine, I promise." Tara said in a comforting
tone. "I'll help
you as much as I can. I just thought you'd like to see."</p>
<p>"I don't see why they need my help."</p>
<p>"They will. Just as you'll need theirs." Tara grasped the girl's hand. "Now
hurry. Lots to
do, and the day is dawning."</p>
<p>The two of them silently walked off Giles' property, the younger of the
pair smiling, as
she thought of a name for herself.</p>
