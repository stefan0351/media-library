<p>Amy emerged from the Slayer's bathroom feeling quiet refreshed.  "That was...awesome!
You have no idea how great it feels to use a bathroom instead of pine shavings."  She
smiled at Willow.</p>

<p>"Amy, I'm so sorry it took so long to get you back.  I should have known Tara would know
what to do."</p>

<p>"Tara? That blonde girl, right?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's right!  You haven't met Tara yet.  We met at college.  She's a real powerful
witch.  It's a very long story with vampires and demons and...well, you know.  The
usual.  Come on, I'll introduce you."  She took Amy's hand and they set off to Buffy's
room.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>"That was, um..."  Tara dropped her head and blushed.</p>

<p>"Yeah."  Buffy sat opposite the blonde witch;  The blonde witch she just kissed not five
seconds ago.  Her mind was running a mile a minute but only one thing on a very primal
level registered,  "Kiss good."</p>

<p>"What?"  Tara lifted her head.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled and was about to explain but Willow and Amy walked through the door.  "Hey."
Buffy and Tara moved quickly apart at their arrival.  "I wanted to introduce Tara to Amy
cause, you know, they've never met because she's been a rat and in the cage in our room
all year and did we interrupt something?"</p>

<p>"No" Tara said.</p>

<p>"Yes"  Buffy answered at the same time.  "No, you didn't."  She said pointedly with a
sideward glance to Tara.  The blonde witch simply dropped her head.</p>

<p>"Ooo-kay."  Willow said.  "I wanted Amy and Tara to meet.  Officially."</p>

<p>"Hey."  Amy waved at her.  "You been practicing long?"</p>

<p>"All my life."  Tara said quietly.  She was still a little hurt at Buffy's tone of voice
but welcomed the distraction of the new witch talking to her.  "My mom, she was, um,
really powerful.  Like Willow is."  She smiled at the redhead.</p>

<p>"I only got powerful when we started doing spells together.  You're the powerful one."
Willow smiled back.</p>

<p>"Alright.  You're both powerful witches.  All three of you in fact.  I think we get it."
Buffy rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>"Anyway, it's nice to meet you Tara."  Amy ignored Buffy's small display.  "I appreciate
you de-ratting me.  I'm sure my dad will be happy.  Speaking of which!  I should go home
and see him.  Wanna come, Will?  You can catch me up on everything."</p>

<p>"Sure, why not."  She turned her attention back to the two blondes on the floor.  "I'll
see you two later?"  They both nodded silently avoiding eye contact with each other.
"Tara, do you wanna go on patrol with the gang tonight?"</p>

<p>"Um, I'll call you.  Okay?"</p>

<p>Willow nodded.  "Okay.  Bye!"  With a wave, Amy and Willow set off for Amy's house.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>The seconds ticked by.  Neither Buffy nor Tara would look at each other. They weren't sure
what had just happened but Buffy could almost pinpoint that old familiar feeling;
Jealousy.  She was jealous when Tara told Amy how powerful she thought Willow was.  And
Buffy had said they didn't interrupt anything important, when in fact they did.  They
interrupted a kiss - their first kiss.  <Way to go Summers.>  Buffy chastised herself.</p>

<p>"I should g-go."  Tara finally said as she got up off the floor.</p>

<p>"Tara, wait."  Buffy reached for her but the stitches made themselves known. "Ouch."</p>

<p>Tara stopped herself and knelt down beside Buffy.  "Are you alright?"</p>

<p>"Damn stitches."   She cursed under her breath.  "Fine, no wait, not fine.  I just wanted... I mean."  Buffy sighed.  How come this was so hard all of a sudden?</p>

<p>"I, um..."  Tara didn't know what to say either.</p>

<p>"Don't go."  Buffy whispered.</p>

<p>Tara barely heard her.  "Are you s-sure?"</p>

<p>The Slayer nodded.  "Yeah, and besides.  You live here now.  Where would you go?"  She
gave her a half smile.</p>

<p>"I guess you're right.  I don't have anywhere else to go."  She frowned.</p>

<p>"Tara, that's not what I meant.  Oh man, this is going all wrong."  Buffy ran her hand
through her hair in frustration.  "I want you here, please don't get me wrong, I just...I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Sorry for what?  You didn't do anything wrong, I---"</p>

<p>"No, I did.  I told Willow she wasn't interrupting when she was.  I didn't want her to
feel bad.  You know?  It's not that I'm ashamed or embarrassed, it's that...I don't
know.  Then you told Amy how powerful you think Will is and I ...wow this is
complicated."</p>

<p>Tara nodded in understanding.  "I know.  But, Buffy, it doesn't have to be." She
tentatively reached her hand out and placed it on the Slayer's.</p>

<p>Buffy smiled.  "You're right.  It doesn't have to be."  She squeezed Tara's hand.  "Wanna
start over again?"</p>

<p>Tara put on her thoughtful face for a moment.  "Well, it depends on how far back you want
to go."  She smiled.</p>

<p>Buffy caught onto the playful tone of her voice.  "Oh, I was thinking somewhere around. .
."  She put her hand up and touched Tara's cheek. "Here."  And slowly closed the gap
between them for another kiss.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>"...so then he came back and said that he could finally be what I needed, but,"  Willow
shrugged.  "He wasn't really.  Don't get me wrong, I'll probably always love Oz, it just
isn't our time now.  Maybe someday."</p>

<p>Amy poked her head out from her closet.  "So you say you and Tara are, uh, broken up now?"</p>

<p>"Yeah.  It's...sad in a way but...I don't know how to explain it.  We decided to take
a break for the summer and still remain friends.  It wasn't that difficult actually once
we talked about it and all.  She means a lot to me. I mean I never would have gotten over
what happened with Oz if it wasn't for her and I owe her a lot.  And I love her, it just
took me a while to realize that maybe it wasn't in a romantic kind of way.  You know?"</p>

<p>Amy stepped out from her closet and made a face.  "You know, I can say with a hundred
percent certainty that my clothes are *way* out of style.  Wanna hit the mall later?"</p>

<p>"Sure!  That would be great!"  Willow smiled.</p>

<p>"Tara and Buffy seem..."  Amy hedged.  She didn't want to say the wrong thing to Willow.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I know.  I'm pretty sure we interrupted something back there."</p>

<p>"So you don't mind?"  Amy sounded surprised.</p>

<p>"Not really, no.  I want them both to be happy.  If it's with each other then, who am I to
argue?  I mean just because Tara and I were together doesn't make her off limits to
Buffy.  Oh my God!"  Willow stood up suddenly.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Riley!  He called to tell me he was coming home early and that he wanted to surprise
Buffy.  He wanted to know where we would be for the summer so he knew where to find her.
Oh no, this could get really, really...unpleasant."</p>

<p>"Buffy's military guy, right?"</p>

<p>Willow nodded.  "Yeah, he's coming home the day after tomorrow."  She turned to Amy.
"What am I gonna do?"</p>

<p>"Looks like you have to tell her, Will.  I mean, if she hasn't already figured out that
she's got a decision to make."</p>

<p>"Can we stop there on the way to the mall?"</p>

<p>"Sure.  Let's go."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>The phone rang.  And rang, and rang, and rang, and...</p>

<p>"Aren't you gonna get that?"  Tara pulled away from Buffy slightly.</p>

<p>The slayer shook her head.  "Uh uh.  Let the machine get it."</p>

<p>'This is Buffy.  I'm out saving the world, please leave a message.  BEEEEEP'</p>

<p>Tara giggled.</p>

<p>"Buffy, it's Riley.  I just wanted to say hey and I'm coming home soon..."</p>

<p>Buffy reached for the phone.  "Riley!  Hi!"  Buffy covered the receiver and mouthed 'I'm
sorry' to Tara.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are there.  How come you're out of breath?  Did something happen?"</p>

<p>"No, I just...I was downstairs when the phone rang.  Now I'm in my room.  Which is where
the phone is, which is where you got me."  She rolled her eyes at how lame that sounded.</p>

<p>"I'm leaving soon.  Three days tops.  I just wanted to see if you'd be with your mom for
the summer or if you and the gang got off campus housing like you talked about."</p>

<p>"No, I'm with mom right now.  Don’t know about the off campus housing sitch yet."</p>

<p>"Am I interrupting something?"</p>

<p>"Uh, actually, yes.  I was just talking to Tara.  She's staying with me for the summer
and..."</p>

<p>"Willow's 'friend'?"</p>

<p>"Yeah.  Only not so much anymore, which is what we were talking about."</p>

<p>"Oh... Oh!  I get it.  They, um, broke up.  Want me to let you go so you can talk?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, that would be great.  I'm sorry, it's just a bad time right now."</p>

<p>"I understand.  I'll call you when I get in."</p>

<p>"Okay, Riley.  That would be great."</p>

<p>"I love you."  He said to a dial tone.</p>

<p>Buffy hung up the phone and looked over at Tara.  She seemed very uncomfortable and
upset.  "Tara?"  She placed her hand on Tara's.  "You okay?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."  She nodded. Then after a moment.  "Well.  No.  That was your, um, boyfriend.
Wasn't it?"</p>

<p>Buffy nodded.  "Yeah, Riley.  Let's not talk about him right now."</p>

<p>"I think we have to, I mean he's..."</p>

<p>"In Washington right now."  Buffy squeezed her hand.  "Things will get complicated soon
enough.  Right now I just want to relax and enjoy your company and the peace and quiet.
Think we can do that?"  Tara smiled at her and nodded.  "Okay then.  Would you mind
helping me up?"</p>

<p>"Not at all."  Tara carefully helped the Slayer stand and get back into bed.  She took her
time so Buffy wouldn't pull the stitches again.  Once she was situated, Tara started to
head for the door.</p>

<p>"Hey.  Where ya goin?"</p>

<p>"I was gonna, you know, give you time to rest.  You must be exhausted with all the
excitement with Amy and I thought you could use the time alone.  Besides, Willow asked if
I wanted to go on patrol.  I thought I'd give it a try."  She smiled.</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head.  "Not without me you're not."</p>

<p>Tara was surprised.  "What?  Why not?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why not.  That vampire that shot me could still be out there and you could
get hurt or killed or..."  Buffy stopped when she saw the look of amusement on Tara's
face.  "What's so funny?"</p>

<p>"Nothing.  I just find it funny, that's all.  That you're being so...protective."</p>

<p>"Of course I'm gonna be protective.  Tara, you're my friend now.  Not just Willow's.  I. .
.I care about you and what happens to you."  <More than you know.></p>

<p>Tara walked back over and sat on the edge of the bed.  "The vampire.  The one that shot
you?  Well, he won't be shooting anyone again.  Or biting them for that matter."  Tara had
one of those 'cat that ate the canary' looks on her face and Buffy knew immediately she'd
done something.</p>

<p>"Tara...what did you do?"  She arched her eyebrow suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Well... I used one of my crystals as a sort of homing device and, um, tracked it
down."  Tara suddenly found something very interesting about the fuzz on Buffy's comforter
and started to pick at it.</p>

<p>"You what?"</p>

<p>"I, uh, staked him."  She shrugged.</p>

<p>"You staked?...oh wow.  I can't believe you did that.  As much as I appreciate it, you
could have gotten hurt and please don't do that ever again."  Buffy smiled at her.</p>

<p>"Well, he shot you and it made me...mad.  So I found him and staked him."  She peeked up
at Buffy through her hair.  "Are you mad?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not.  Actually, I'm kind of impressed.  I'm not a bad teacher.  Wouldn't you
say?"</p>

<p>Tara smiled at her.  "Nope.  Not bad at all."  Feeling brave suddenly, Tara leaned over
slowly and kissed her.  Buffy gladly returned the kiss and they didn't even hear the door
open.</p>

<p>"Hey, Buff!  I heard you were... .KISSINGWILLOWSGIRLFRIEND!?!?!"  Xander burst through
Buffy's bedroom door in his usual chipper way expecting to see a sad and depressed
Slayer.  He found the exact opposite.</p>

<p>"Xander!  Haven't you learned how to knock yet?!"  Buffy glared at him.</p>

<p>Willow walked in right behind him with Amy in tow.  "Hey!  I didn't know you were coming
over, Xander. Ooh, look at what Tara, Buffy and I did!"  She took Amy by the hand and
brought her around so Xander could see her.</p>

<p>"Amy?  How did?  Willow?  Then Buffy and Tara were... "  He shook his head as if it
would somehow make sense of everything.  It didn't work.  "Apparently, I still don't get
out of the basement as much as I should."</p>

<p>"Willow.  I was just about to lecture Xander on the fine art of knocking before entering.
Good thing you're here so I don't have to repeat myself."  There was a slight edge to the
Slayer's voice.</p>

<p>"Well, Amy and I stopped by on the way to the mall.  I had to tell you something
important.  There's no easy way to say it so...Riley called me.  He's coming home the
day after tomorrow.  He wanted to surprise you.  I thought you might want to know cause
of, well, things.  You know...so I had good reason to be here, very good reason!  And
could you stop throwing the mental stakes my way?  Please?"</p>

<p>"Oh.  He told me...never mind."  She shook her head.  "I'm sorry, Will.  I don't want to
deal with this right now, any of it.  Okay?"  Buffy looked at Willow imploringly.</p>

<p>The hacker nodded in understanding.  "Yeah, I get it.  So, um, Amy and I are gonna go to
the mall."  She turned to Xander.  "Wanna come?  Amy and I can fill in some of the gaps
for you."</p>

<p>Xander still stood in the middle of the room, dumbfounded.  He couldn't answer right away,
so he just nodded.</p>

<p>Willow grabbed him by the arm and pulled him towards the door.  "Talk to you later, Buff?"</p>

<p>"Definitely."  She smiled.  "Oh, and, Will? Thanks."</p>

<p>Willow smiled at her and closed the door.  Before anything else could happen, Buffy got up
out of the bed, walked to her door and locked it.  She turned around and smiled at Tara
playfully.  "Now.  Where were we?"</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>After Xander got the full scoop on what was going on with Willow and Tara, he opted to
just go back to his basement and give Willow and Amy time to catch up.  They were
currently hitting the last store on the third floor.  It was the last one because, after
this, they probably couldn't carry anything else.</p>

<p>They walked into 'Wiccan Ways', one of the more mainstream occult shops in Sunnydale.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is beautiful."  Willow said.</p>

<p>"What is it?"  Amy peeked over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"It's an amethyst crystal pendant and it's,"  Willow turned the tag over.  "Very pretty
and I'm putting it back now."</p>

<p>"You wanna try some spells tonight?  I was thinking maybe some conjuring, a little
levitation maybe..."</p>

<p>"Really?"  Willow's eyes lit up.  "Are you up for it cause you've been, you know, ratted
and all and...really?  Oh, it would be so great if the three of us could try some stuff
together!  I found this really great book with spells in it but it requires another person
and there are some great-"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I'm serious."  Amy laughed at her friend's excitement.  "Why don't you grab
some of the ingredients now.  Mother wart, Sage and some Bristle Bane to start us off.
Okay?"</p>

<p>Willow nodded and skipped off to the potion section of the store.  Amy looked over to make
sure Willow was occupied and picked up the pendant.  Quickly, she went over to the cash
register to pay for it with the credit card  her father happily gave her then hid it in
one of her bags.</p>

<p>Willow joined Amy outside the store after she paid at the register.  "I got a few extra
supplies...just in case."</p>

<p>"From the size of that bag, it looks like you bought one of everything, Will."</p>

<p>"Well, three of everything now that you're back!  You can never be too prepared.  You
ready?"</p>

<p>"Sure!  Let's go back to my place.  I think we've walked in on Buffy and Tara too many
times already.  If I didn't know any better, I'd say she was ready to stake us earlier."</p>

<p>Willow smiled.  "Yeah, well, I don't know about you cause you just got back and all but I
was feelin' the pointyness...believe me.  Besides, those two need some time alone."</p>

<p>"So do we."  Amy's eyes went wide when she realized what she said.  "I mean I just got
back and you still haven't caught me up on everything.  Like Anya, for instance."</p>

<p>"Anya."  Willow rolled her eyes.  "It's gonna take some time to explain her."    She
grabbed the bags in front of Amy and they set off together to the Madison residence.  "It
all started after Cordy got out of the hospital..."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>"...So then right after Buffy blew up the school, Cordy left for L.A."</p>

<p>Willow, Xander, Amy and Tara were on patrol.  Willow had searched the computer that
evening, looking for mysterious deaths through the coroner's office and found one that was
in Restfield cemetery close to Buffy's house.  Which is the only reason Tara was with
them.  Buffy protested as much as she could, but Tara won out and was able to go only
after she promised to take Buffy's mom's cell phone in case there was trouble.  Now Willow
was finishing up the story of the Mayor and Faith and everything that went along with it.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Will, for re-telling the story of one of the most painful years of my life."
Xander quipped.</p>

<p>"Oh come on, Xander, it wasn't that bad.  I mean sure, you and Cordelia broke up and we
almost got eaten by a big Mayor snake but, it was our senior year!  We got to go to the
prom, and..."</p>

<p>"Yeah, the prom.  Let's talk about that.  Anyone remember the hellhounds that were let
loose by that student?  It was like this sick pavlovian experiment gone horribly wrong.
Madness I tell you, utter madness!"</p>

<p>Willow smiled at him.  "Point taken, Xander."</p>

<p>"You know, if I didn't know any better, I'd say you two are like an old married couple."
Amy laughed.  "I would have put money on you guys getting together back in high school."</p>

<p>Both Willow and Xander looked away from each other.  "Well..."  Willow hedged.</p>

<p>"Yeah, you see Amy, uh..."</p>

<p>"You're kidding!"  She stopped in her tracks.  "You mean you two?"</p>

<p>They both nodded.  Willow kicked at a rock in the grass.  "Well, it was during homecoming
and,"</p>

<p>"And we were all dressed up and Will said she didn't know how to dance and," Xander
shrugged.</p>

<p>"Weren't you both, um, with people?"  Tara asked.  She'd been watching the friends catch
up on old times and was happy just to observe.  She had heard most of the stories anyway
from Willow, but she never knew that Willow and Xander were together.</p>

<p>They both nodded.</p>

<p>"It's done." He said. "But I'm never putting on formal wear again."</p>

<p>"Here, here." Willow chimed in.  "No more clothes fluking for me thank you."</p>

<p>"So it's a big, 'NO' on dressing up?" Amy asked, making sure.</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>"Not even for a wedding? Or a party? Anything?"</p>

<p>"No way. Nu uh." Xander said adamantly.</p>

<p>"But what if you have no choice?"</p>

<p>"Then I'll lock myself away from society and become a hermit who lives in the woods." He
sighed. "I think I liked you better as a rat."</p>

<p>"Xander!" Willow exclaimed.</p>

<p>Amy grinned.</p>

<p>"What?" He looked over at Tara, who had a smirk on her face. "Tara, it just occurred to me
that we haven't really talked much."</p>

<p>"No, not r-really."  Tara said, not liking the look in his eye.</p>

<p>"So tell me about yourself. Favorite color? Food? Hobbies?" He rattled off questions. "No,
wait. I've got a question. When did you and the Buffster become so close? If you know what
I mean."  He wiggled his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Xander!"  Amy exclaimed this time.  "You and your hormones better leave her alone or I'll
turn *you* into a rat."  He visibly gulped and Tara and Willow chuckled.</p>

<p>"It's okay, Amy."  Tara said.  She turned her attention back to Xander.  "I was supposed
to stay with Willow for the summer.  She went on an  unplanned vacation with her parents
and, um, I wound up staying with Buffy instead."  She paused a moment.  "Oh, purple and
angel hair pasta."  She smiled.</p>

<p>"Huh? Purple angel hair pasta?  Did I miss an episode of Emril on the Food Network?""  He
scratched his head.</p>

<p>"Favorite color and food, Xander."  Willow playfully slugged him in the arm.  "My best
friend, Attention Span Boy.  Unable to switch gears in a conversation...ever."</p>

<p>"Willow,"  Xander put his arm around his best friend.  "Has anyone ever told you that
you're such a...vampire!"</p>

<p>"Not since senior year..."  She trailed off confused.  "Oh!!  You mean..."  She turned
around and sure enough there was one standing behind her.</p>

<p>The vampire growled at them and charged.  Just as he was about to meet the business end of
Willow's stake, he swerved and sent Willow and Xander crashing to the ground.</p>

<p>"Hey!  That wasn't very nice!"  Willow yelled at him.  "Big mean vampire."</p>

<p>"Amy, look out!"  Xander yelled a little too late.</p>

<p>The vampire charged her and tackled her to the ground.  She was winded and unable to fight
him off, and before she knew it he was biting into her neck.  Then all of a sudden he was
gone and there was nothing left but dust and Tara standing over her.  "A-are you okay?"
She knelt down next to Amy.</p>

<p>"I think so."  She put her hand up to her neck and winced.  "If I come home with a hickey
my dad's gonna kill me!"</p>

<p>"Amy!"  Willow ran over to her.  "Let me see."  She pushed some hair away from her neck
and inspected the wound.  "It's not too bad but you should get it cleaned up so it won't
get infected.  Are you okay?"  There was concern clearly etched on her face.</p>

<p>"I'm fine, Will.  Thanks to Tara."  She smiled at the blonde witch.  "Thank you.  How did
you?"  A look of understanding crossed her face.  "I see, you've been training with
Buffy."</p>

<p>Tara blushed and dropped her head in embarrassment.  "You're welcome.  And yeah, she
showed me a few things."</p>

<p>"Not swimming anymore I guess."  Willow smiled at her and Tara nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>"Swimming?"  Amy questioned.</p>

<p>"Long story."  Willow looked up just as Xander got there.  "Nice of you to join us."</p>

<p>"You girls alright?  Man, that fang came outta no where."  He was thoughtful for a
moment.  "Hey, Will, wasn't that Jack Speevy?"</p>

<p>"The quarterback at UC Sunnydale?  Yeah, it was.  I should have known, he zigged when we
zagged."</p>

<p>"Cheater.  Using his athletic ability to get a late night snack.  Serves him right for
getting dusted."</p>

<p>"Ouch."  Amy tried to get up but almost fell back to the ground again as she did.  Willow
caught her arm.  "I think I twisted something."  She made a face.  "Great."</p>

<p>"Okay, I call this patrol officially over on account of injury.  Any objections?"  Willow
arched her eyebrows at Xander and Tara.  They both shook their heads.  "Good.  Why don't
you walk Tara back to Buffy's, Xander.  I'll head to Amy's place with her."</p>

<p>"Will, I'll be fine, really.  It's just sprained."</p>

<p>Willow gave her a look.  A look that Amy Madison feared right along with the other members
of the Scooby gang.  "Oh no."  Amy pretended to be afraid.  "Anything but the 'resolve
face.'"</p>

<p>"Go ahead, mock and laugh.  You're going straight home so we can get some ice on that
ankle.  Wanna argue?"  She tried to look serious but broke out into a smile.</p>

<p>"Okay, fine."  Amy relented.</p>

<p>"Good.  We'll see you two tomorrow then."  Willow put her arm around Amy's waist and they
slowly started the walk back to her house.</p>

<p>Xander watched in confusion as they walked through the gates out to the sidewalk.  "If I
didn't know any better, I'd say they were..."  He looked over at Tara who was grinning.</p>

<p>"Um, flirting?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"You're not as unobservant as Willow thinks you are."</p>

<p>"Hey!  I'll have you know that I'm as unobservant as the rest of the population."  He
thought about this for a moment.  "Uh, or possibly I should say thank you."  He shoved his
hands in his pockets and smiled sheepishly.  "Well, what do you say we get you back to
Buffy's safe and sound?  The last thing I need is something happening to you.  She'd fry
my hide."</p>

<p>Tara giggled as they headed toward the exit.  "She's not that bad."</p>

<p>"See, when I say fry, I mean literally.  The last time someone hurt someone she cared
about, she blew them up into little charbroiled kibbles and bits, and the high school
right along with him."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>"Will, I'm fine."  Amy said for the fourth time since they got back to her house.</p>

<p>Since then, Willow had helped her to bed, gotten her sleeping clothes, made her tea, put
ice in an icepack and put her foot up on a pillow.  Now she had her personal first aid kit
out and was cleaning out her neck wound.</p>

<p>"That stings!"</p>

<p>Willow made a face.  "Well of course it's gonna sting, if it didn't then it wouldn't be
doing it's job."</p>

<p>Amy smiled.  "I'm fine, Will.  You don't have to do this for me, really.  You've done
enough."</p>

<p>"I haven't even begun to do enough, Amy!  You were a rat for over a year and I couldn't
fix it and your dad was so worried about you and you missed so much school and now you're
a year behind us and Xander and I should have been able to get rid of that vampire but we
weren't on our game tonight and---"</p>

<p>Amy silenced her with a finger across her lips.  "Will, it's not your fault.  Any of it.
I turned myself into a rat and I never taught you how to turn me back.  It's my own fault
I'm a year behind and as far as the vampire goes, well, I thought we agreed that he had an
unfair advantage being a football player?"  She smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes, but---"</p>

<p>Amy put her finger up again and Willow didn't say anything.  "No buts or if only's or any
of that."  She reached down next to her bed and grabbed a small white bag.  "I was saving
this but,"  Amy blushed and put her head down for a second.  "I, um bought this for you.
It's to thank you for getting me outta that habitrail *and* to show you how much I don't
blame you for any of it."</p>

<p>"Amy,"  Willow smiled.  "I don't know what to say."</p>

<p>"Don't say anything till you open it."</p>

<p>Willow laughed.  "Okay."  She opened the bag and took out a small purple velvet jewlery
box.  She looked back up at Amy who coaxed her on to open it.  As Willow pulled open the
lid she gasped.  "Oh, Amy, you shouldn't have."  She lifted out the amythest pendant on a
black velvet rope.  The same one they saw in 'Wiccan Ways' earlier at the mall.</p>

<p>"Of course I should have.  Do you like it?"</p>

<p>"No, I mean...yes!  Of course I do. I just mean, you *really* shouldn't have."  Out of
her backpack, Willow pulled out the same white bag and produced the same purple velvet
box.</p>

<p>"No way."  Amy gaped.</p>

<p>"Yes way."  Willow smiled at her and handed her the box.  "I bought it as sort of a
welcome back gift."  She blushed.  "Looks like we have the same taste."</p>

<p>"Yeah."  Amy smiled.  "You know, I think we have the same taste in a lot of things.
Otherwise, we wouldn't be such close friends."</p>

<p>Willow looked up at her.  "You consider us close friends?"</p>

<p>"Willow!  Of course I do.  We were close in high school, at least I like to think so.  We
drifted a little when you got together with Oz, but"</p>

<p>"Yeah, and you were with Michael."  Willow nodded in understanding.</p>

<p>"Michael?  The guy from high school that warned us about our parents going all 'burning
times' on us?"  Amy shook her head and laughed.  "God no, Will.  Not that he wasn't
attractive, I just, he didn't attract *me*.  Get it?"</p>

<p>"I get it.  He wasn't your type then.  You know, come to think of it, I don't think I have
a type either.  I mean, I'd always been attracted to Xander, then Oz came along and
they're totally different and---"</p>

<p>"Will, no,"  Amy shook her head and smiled.  How was she supposed to explain this?  It
shouldn't be that difficult, after all, this was Willow who just got done telling her all
about her relationship with Tara during her first year at college.  "I, um"  She blushed.
This wasn't supposed to be this difficult.</p>

<p>A look of realization suddenly washed across Willow's face.  "Oh."  She nodded.  "Oh,
oh!!  You mean, that you...uh,"</p>

<p>"Play for the other team?"  Amy asked and smiled.  Willow's eyes went wide, which caused
Amy to smile wider and suddenly they both broke out in a fit of giggles.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of laughter, Willow was holding her stomach and begging Amy to stop
laughing.  "Oh, ouch it hurts!  Stop laughing!"</p>

<p>Amy was trying to catch her breath.  "Me?  You stop laughing and I'll stop."</p>

<p>This went on for a few moments longer until neither one of them could take it any more.
Willow turned her head and smiled at the brunette witch.  "Okay, I think I just earned
enough giggle points for the whole week."</p>

<p>Amy nodded.  "Yeah, me too.  I can't laugh anymore otherwise my stomach will start to hurt
again."  She laid there with Willow for a while, just happy to be in her company.  After a
few minutes she rolled over on her side and looked at her.  Her eyes were closed.  "Will?"</p>

<p>"Hmm?"</p>

<p>"If you're tired then you should go.  You don't have to keep me company."</p>

<p>"No, I want to.  I wanna be here."  She opened her eyes and smiled.</p>

<p>"Would you, um...put my necklace on me?  Please?"</p>

<p>Willow propped herself up on one elbow.  "Only if you put mine on afterwards."</p>

<p>"Deal."  Amy nodded.</p>

<p>Willow moved around behind Amy and unclasped the pendant.  She placed it around her neck
and reclasped it, then moved Amy's hair back into place.  She let her hands linger there
for a few moments, guiltily.  &lt;No, not guilty.  I don't have anything to feel guilty
for.&gt;  She thought.</p>

<p>"Want me to put yours on?"  Amy whispered.</p>

<p>"Um, yeah.  That would be nice."</p>

<p>They switched positions and Amy put the pendant around Willow's neck.  "You're hair has
gotten long."  Amy slowly raked her fingers though the crimson locks admiring the
silkyness of it.  "At least from what I remember."</p>

<p>"Yeah,"  Willow breathed out.  "Long."</p>

<p>"I like it.  It's nice."  Her hands moved from Willow's hair to her shoulders.  She
immediatly noticed that there were knots there and that just wouldn't do.  She began to
work them out slowly, kneading her thumbs into Willow's shoulder blades and working her
fingers across her shoulders.</p>

<p>"That's nice, but"  Willow held her breath as Amy came across a particularly nasty knot.
"Shouldn't I be doing this for you?  I mean, you're the one that got hurt and---"</p>

<p>"No, I don't mind.  I actually like doing this,"  <To you.>  Amy finished in her mind.
"You're so tense, Will.  Daily vampire slayage isn't so good for you shoulders.  Makes'em
hard as rocks."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I know.  When I came back to the dorm from patrol with Buffy, Tara used to. .
.nevermind."  Willow  kicked herself for that train of thought.</p>

<p>Amy stopped and sat next to her.  "Hey, it's alright.  You can talk about Tara.  It's not
tabboo or anything."  She smiled.</p>

<p>Willow shrugged.  "I just, I don't know."  She shook her head.  <No time like the
present.>  "Amy?  What's happening between us?"  She whispered.</p>

<p>Amy placed her hand on Willow's.  "What ever we want I guess.  I mean, if that's okay with
you?"  She held her breath, waiting for the answer.</p>

<p>Willow nodded.  "It's *so* okay."  She looked up and smiled.</p>

<p>Amy got a mischevious look on her face.  "Did I ever tell you how big of a crush I had on
you in high school?"  Willow blushed and shook her head, placing her chin firmly on her
chest.  Amy reached over and lifted her chin with her finger.  "Well I did.  But you were
with Oz and you two, I don't know...seemed to just fit I guess.  I was so jealous of
him."</p>

<p>"We fit back then but,"  she paused.  "things change.  You know?"</p>

<p>"Boy do I ever."  Amy smiled.  "Willow? Would you, um, stay with me tonight?  I mean just
stay over, not do anything, just to be close, to be together and I won't try anything I
swear and...okay, stopping now.  I think you gave me your nervous babble through
osmosis."  She blushed.</p>

<p>"Of course I'll stay with you.  I thought you'd never ask."  Willow got up and grabbed her
bag.  Luckily, she brought a change of clothes incase it would be a messy patrol.  You
never knew if you'd run into a slime demon.  She borrowed some shorts and a t-shirt from
Amy and went to the bathroom to change.  When she came out, she found Amy in bed waiting
for her.</p>

<p>"I hope this is okay? I mean, it's this or the floor. . oh, if you want the bed I could
take the floor and,"  she stopped when she saw Willow grinning and surpressing a chuckle.
"I'm glad you find my babble amusing."</p>

<p>"The bed is fine.  No you don't have to sleep on the floor and yes, I find it greatly
amusing."  She slid under the covers next to Amy and turned out the light.</p>

<p>After tossing and turning a few times, mostly because of the close proximity of the cute
redhead, Amy decided to swallow her fear and just do it.  She reached out and touched
Willow's shoulder.</p>

<p>Willow turned over and snuggled in under Amy's arm as if she knew exactly what the girl
wanted.  She draped her arm across her stomach comfortably and smiled in content.  "Night,
Amy."</p>

<p>"Night, Will."  Amy replied and placed a tender kiss on her forehead.</p>

<p>They were asleep in moments.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>***The next morning***</p>

<p>Buffy hung up the phone.  "Still no answer at Will's house.  I hope she's okay."</p>

<p>"I'm sure she's fine."  Tara smiled and got up off the bed to stretch.</p>

<p>"I don't like that look, missy.  Is there something going on that I should know about?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'd be willing to bet that Willow spent the night at Amy's last night."  Tara's
smile broadened.</p>

<p>"No way!"  Buffy's eyes widened.  "I didn't think it would happen so soon...I mean,"
She shook her head.  "I'm sorry.  Are you...are you okay with this?"</p>

<p>Tara sat down on the bed next to her.  "Buffy, you're so sweet to ask me that."  She took
her hand.  "Of course I'm okay with it, Willow deserves to be happy."  She dropped her
voice to a whisper.  "As happy as I am."</p>

<p>"Oh.  And just what is it that's been making you happy all of a sudden?"</p>

<p>"This."  Tara leaned in and kissed Buffy lightly on the lips.  She began to pull away but
found Buffy's hand slide up her arm and settle in her hair.</p>

<p>The door opened.</p>

<p>"Buffy, I'm...oh, God."</p>

<p>The two girls broke from the kiss to find Riley standing in the doorway, mouth agape.</p>

<p>"Riley."  Buffy stood up.  "I, uh, didn't expect..."</p>

<p>"No, I'm sure you didn't"  He glared at her.  "I can see I'm interupting.  I'll go."  He
walked out.</p>

<p>Buffy ran after him.  "Riley, wait!"</p>

<p>Tara sat dumbfounded on Buffy's bed.  She didn't know if she should go after them or leave
them alone or...her train of thought was interruped by the phone ringing.  "H-hello?"</p>

<p>"Tara, it's Willow.  Amy and I wanted to know if you and Buffy wanted to go for
breakfast."</p>

<p>"I, um...don't think that's..."</p>

<p>"Tara, what's wrong?"</p>

<p>Tara sighed and tried to keep the shaking out of her voice.  "R-riley's home."</p>

<p>"Oh, no.  When?"</p>

<p>"A minute ago. He. . he kind of, um, walked in..."</p>

<p>"Met us at the Fryer.  We'll have lunch and talk.  Okay?"</p>

<p>"Okay.  And Willow?  Thank you."</p>

<p>"Anytime.  See you soon."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Tara hung up the phone and changed quickly in the bathroom.  She cautiously made her way
down the steps hoping that she wouldn't run into Buffy and Riley.  She could hear their
voices but didn't know where they were coming from.  Peeking around the corner to make
sure to coast was clear, Tara slipped out of the back door and collided head on with
Riley.  She fell to the ground.</p>

<p>"I'm...I'm sorry."  She grabbed her backpack, got up and dusted off her skirt.</p>

<p>"Tara, where are you going?"  Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"To meet Willow and Amy."  She kept her head down and wiped at a tear trailing down her
cheek.</p>

<p>Buffy noticed the gesture.  "Tara, wait."  She pleaded.</p>

<p>"No, I...I h-have to go.  Now."  She took off down the driveway and broke out into a
full sprint down the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"Tara!"  Buffy yelled after her.</p>

<p>"Let her go."  Riley said levelly from behind Buffy.</p>

<p>Buffy froze in her tracks.  For half a second as Tara was fleeing, she totally forgot
about Riley standing there.  <Okay, Summers, first things first.>  She tried to gain some
composure then turned around to face him.  As always, his face was an unreadable mask.
"Riley, I..."  She shook her head and went to sit at the picnic table.  "I don't know
where to begin."</p>

<p>"How about at the beginning."</p>

<p>"Willow went on vacation with her parents last minute and Tara was supposed to stay with
her for the summer..."</p>

<p>"And let me guess.  You were comforting her over their breakup?"  Riley crossed his arms
in his typical defensive positon.</p>

<p>Buffy sighed.  "Are you gonna listen or go all macho man on me?"</p>

<p>"What's the point?  You can sit here and explain all you want.  The bottom line stays the
same."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean for this to happen.  I hope you can believe me."  She whispered.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to believe. Ever since I met you, I haven't been sure if up was really
up and down was really down."  He paced for a moment then turned to her.  "Do you love
her?"</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head.  "See, that's the thing.  I don't know.  This whole thing with Tara,
it kind of snuck up on me.  On both of us.  I...I kinda got tossed into having her live
with me but once she did things kind of happened one after the other."</p>

<p>"What things?  Like kissing?"</p>

<p>"Riley,"  Buffy got up and stood in front of him.  She hadn't seen that look in his eyes
since the time he though she'd slept with Angel.  This was worse becuase he actually had
confirmation that she'd been cheating.  "We were out on patrol and I got hurt.  Shot
actually."</p>

<p>"You were shot?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, and she was there.  She saved my life."</p>

<p>"So this is an 'extreme emotion' thing, then."  He sighed in relief.  "Good, cause I knew
you wouldn't like someone like her that way."  He reached out to touch her arm but she
recoiled.</p>

<p>"What exactly do you mean 'someone like her'?"  Buffy narrowed her eyes at him.</p>

<p>"You know,"  He shrugged.</p>

<p>"No, I don't know.  And this isn't some 'extreme emotion' thing either. . we. . we have
things in common and,"</p>

<p>Riley put his hands up to stop her.  "I don't think I need to hear this."</p>

<p>"Then what do you want to hear?"  Buffy was getting frustrated now.</p>

<p>"I want to hear that you love me, that we can work this out, that you still want to be
together and that Tara was, well, that she was a moment of weakness."</p>

<p>"I do love you..."</p>

<p>"I detect a but in there,"</p>

<p>She smiled at him despite the situation.  "*But*, I think I want to see where this thing
with Tara goes.  In my line of work you don't get second chances and there's no pot of
gold at the end of a day of slayage.  I'm lucky my house is still standing concidering
everything this town has faced.  I can't just let something like this go by the way side
and say 'oh, maybe some other time'.  I don't get another time.  I've already died once,
I'm not a cat here, one of these days..."</p>

<p>"Don't talk like that.  You can stop, someday."</p>

<p>"You still don't get it?  This is my life – take it or take it.  I don't have an option
number two or another box to check for career goal.  I'm the Slayer and I'll die the
Slayer."</p>

<p>"I don't know If I can."</p>

<p>"Can what?"</p>

<p>"Take it. Fully understand it."</p>

<p>"If you can't," She sighed, "then I was right. *We* are doomed."</p>

<p>"And I bet Tara doesn't have any problems with understanding your life." He said, angrier
than he had intended.</p>

<p>"No. She doesn't." Buffy felt a pounding in her head. "Can you please stop bringing her
in?"</p>

<p>"This is about her and me, isn't it?" Riley asked. "She can get everything. Demons - good
and bad. Magick, fairies, leprechauns -"</p>

<p>"There's no such things as leprech -" She tried to say.</p>

<p>"Whatever. She can get that stuff and I can't. So, your choice is pretty simple."</p>

<p>"I said I loved you, didn't I?" She held her hand up before he could answer. "Look, this
could go on forever, so I'll say this and be done. My life isn't going to change, Riley,
and if you can't deal, then we can't stay together."  It was simple, however harsh, but
she was too damn tired of being the victim when it came to relationships. It was an
ultimatum, and the ball was in his court.</p>

<p>"You know, you told me once that there was this bunch of council guys that made the
rules.  I asked you if you followed them and you said the ones you were going to do,
anyway.  Remember that?"</p>

<p>"Yeah.  What does that have to do with..."</p>

<p>He raised his hand and cut her off.  "You're still following the rules *they* made,
Buffy.  You're the Slayer without that council.  You're doing what you were trained to
do.  If you're so gung ho on making your own rules now, then why not just quit?  Why do
any of it?"</p>

<p>She shook her head sadly.  He just didn't get it, and probably never would.  She knew by
his line of questioning where this was leading and she didn't want to go down that road.
She shouldn't have to justify her job and what she was destined to do.  No matter how
crappy the retirement plan was.  "Thank you."</p>

<p>He looked at her a little puzzled.  "Thank you?  For what?"</p>

<p>"For answering my question.  You don't get it and you never will."  She sighed and walked
towards her back door.  "You can't accept me for who I am and what my destiny is.  I told
you once that there was a lot of grey in my life and you said we'd work though it.  Now I
know we can't...you can't.  It's still all cut and dry, black and white, good demon bad
demon – to you anyway.  I'm sorry, Riley, but my life is full of grey and red and blue
and..."  She smiled to herself.  "Every color of the rainbow.  And you just can't accept
that and I don't think you ever did.  Not really."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you find our break up amusing."  He bit out angrily.</p>

<p>"I *really* don't."  She opened the door and turned to him again.  "Goodbye, Riley."  She
closed the door quietly behind her.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>"I wonder what's taking her so long?"  Willow was sitting across from Amy in a booth at
the Fryer – the only place in town that could be concidered a diner, well, after you
dripped all the grease off your plate.  They'd gotten there right on time and had been
waiting at least ten minutes for Tara to show up.  Buffy's house was only five minutes
away.  Willow subconciously slipped into 'worry face'.</p>

<p>Amy looked up at her.  "Take it off."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Your patented 'worry face'.  Take it off, there's no need for it.  I'm sure she's fine."</p>

<p>Willow smiled and shook her head.</p>

<p>"What?"  Amy asked, amused.</p>

<p>"Nothing, I just find it funny that you know my worry face, that's all."</p>

<p>"And your resolve face, scared face, happy face---"</p>

<p>"Okay, okay, I get it."  She laughed.</p>

<p>"Surprised?"</p>

<p>Willow shrugged.  "Well, you did live with me for over a year...even if it was in rat
form.  I'll bet you saw my face plenty of times and my..."  Willow's eyes went wide.
"Oh, no!"  She gasped.  "Before graduation with Oz and, and changing in my dorm everyday
and...before graduation with Oz and I *really* can't get past the graduation part. . "
She blushed.</p>

<p>"Will, take it easy."  Amy placed her hand on Willow's.  "It's okay, really."  Amy tried
to reassure the blushing redhead but only managed to blush herself.</p>

<p>"Oh, no."  Willow shook her head.  "I can't believe...I mean I didn't even think!"</p>

<p>"Will, really.  It's okay.  I didn't really see anything.  I don't remember much as a rat
anyway.  They have very short memories you know."  Unbeknownst to Willow, Amy had her
fingers crossed behind her back.</p>

<p>"Really?"  Willow was hopefull.</p>

<p>"Really.  I swear.  Ex-rat's honor."  Amy put her hands up in front of her in a begging
position and made little squeaking noises.  While it turned the redhead's attention away
from her embarassment, it was begining to attract the attention of the other patrons.</p>

<p>"Okay, I believe you.  Now could you stop please?"</p>

<p>"That's the 'begging face'."  Amy smiled.  "Okay, I'll stop."</p>

<p>Willow looked at her watch again.  "I'm starting to get worried."</p>

<p>"Starting?"</p>

<p>"Amy, I'm serious."  Willow tilted her head to the side and pouted.</p>

<p>She placed her hands over Willow's on the table.  "I know, and I'm sure she's fine, Will.
Maybe she's just collecting herself before she gets here."  She rubbed the back of
Willow's hand with her thumb, which made the redhead smile.  "So am I cleared for patrol
tonight, Doctor Rosenberg?"</p>

<p>Willow's look turned serious.  "I don't know.  I mean, I think we did a good job with that
healing spell this morning but, you're still limping a bit."</p>

<p>Amy leaned over the table a little so that her face was inches away from Willows.  "What
if I promise to be really, *really* good and try my best not to get bitten?"  She lifted
her hand and tucked some stry red hair behind Willow's ear.  "Well, by the un-dead,
anyway."  She whispered.</p>

<p>Willow gulped.  Her eyes darted from Amy's face, to their hands resting on the table, then
back again.  The close proximity of the other witch was wreaking havoc on her nerve
endings – but in a good way.  "Oh, okay, I guess if you. .promise."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think you've got my word on that."  She squeezed Willows hand and could feel the
palpable tension between them.  She swallowed down her fear and began to lean in closer. .
.</p>

<p>"A-am I interrupting?"  They both jumped when Tara appeared in front of them.  "I'm
interrupting, aren't I?"  She started to move away.</p>

<p>Willow jumped up.  "Tara, no!  We've been worried about you.  Are you okay?"  She placed
her hand on Tara's shoulder.</p>

<p>The blonde witch stopped. "I-I'm okay I guess.  Riley's home."  She shrugged. "But I guess
I already told you that."</p>

<p>Amy looked at the girl, sympathetically.  "Do you guys wanna get out of here?  Go for a
walk or something?"</p>

<p>Tara nodded.  Willow and Amy gathered their things and paid for thier drinks.  The three
of them headed out the door, only to run into Buffy coming in.</p>

<p>"Hey!  Buffy.  Look, Buffy's here."  Willow greeted the Slayer.</p>

<p>" I thought I'd never find you guys."  The Slayer was out of breath.  "Figures you'd be
the last place I looked."  She looked over at Tara who was desperatly trying to disappear
behind Amy.  She looked over at her.  "Hey."</p>

<p>"Hey."  Tara forced a smile.</p>

<p>"Why don't we leave you two to talk?"  Amy took Willow's hand and was about to head out
the door.</p>

<p>"No, wait."  Buffy stopped them.  "I want to talk to the three of you actually.  Can we go
to the park or something?"</p>

<p>The three of them looked at each other and shrugged.  "Um, sure. Why not."  Amy said.</p>

<p>"Actually,"  Willow hedged.  "I think you two need some time alone right now."  She looked
between Buffy and Tara.  "Amy and I will meet you in Weatherbey park when you're done
talking."</p>

<p>"Sounds goo---"</p>

<p>"No,"  Tara cut Buffy off.  The three of them looked over at her, shocked, and she
immediatly took off down the street.</p>

<p>"Tara, wait!"  Buffy yelled.  She then turned to Amy and Willow.  "Why does it feel like
all I've been doing is chasing her lately?"  She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I think I know what's going on, Buffy."  Willow offered.  "Let me go talk to her."</p>

<p>"If you think it'll help, Will, sure."  Buffy felt as though she was at her wits end.  She
intended to explain everything to Tara;  Riley, why they broke up, how she felt, and most
importantly why she chose to continue things with the blonde witch.  She felt like she'd
just watched her chance at something great run off down the street.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Buffy."  Willow squeezed her arm before heading out of The Fryer to find
Tara, and she was pretty sure about exactly where she'd be.  "We'll meet you on patrol."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Tara was running.  No purpose, no direction, no reason.  Well, there was a reason;
Buffy.  She couldn't face the Slayer and anything she had to say.  She just knew it would
all turn out wrong and be a big disappointment to her.  Why didn't things ever go her
way?  Why, when she finally felt happy again, did it all go down the tubes.</p>

<p>She was out of breath and looked up to find herself in the middle of the cemetary.  It
wasn't just any cemetary though.  It was one of the oldest in Sunnydale and has a
wonderful and warm 'magick' feel to it.  She even came here at night sometimes.  She knew
for a fact that no one had been buried here in at least fifty years, so she concidered it
a safe haven.  Often, She'd come here just to empty out her head and relax.  She walked
over to one of the bigger trees and sat down in the shade.</p>

<p>She must have dozed off, because the next thing she knew, Willow was gently shaking her.
"Tara, wake up."</p>

<p>"Hmm?"  She blinked once or twice and looked around.  The sun had almost set.  "Willow.
What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"I could ask you the same question you know.  I've been looking for you for almost two
hours.  I could have sworn you'd go to the grove on the other side of town."</p>

<p>"No, I...I just kind of wound up here I guess."  She shrugged.</p>

<p>Willow sat down in the grass beside her.  "Tara, why did you run?"</p>

<p>Tara took a few moments in responding.  "I'm not sure.  A lot of reasons."  She almost
whispered.  "I guess...a lot of it had to do with not wanting to go through it again."</p>

<p>"Through what again?"  Willow was genuinly confused.</p>

<p>"The whole, um, choice thing?  It kind of...well, it wasn't a very pleasant experience
last time, so" She shrugged and smiled nervously.</p>

<p>Willow nodded in understanding.  "I get it.  And I'm sorry for that but---"</p>

<p>"No, you don't have to apologize, I just. . I just don't think I could do it again."</p>

<p>"Tara, whether you realize it or not, you are...involved in this and good or bad, I
think you'll regret it if you don't see it though till the end.  Whatever ending there may
be."</p>

<p>Tara smiled.  "Yeah, I guess you're right.  You...you know me really well.  Better than
I think anyone ever has.  I'm glad we're still friends.  I really mean that."</p>

<p>Willow hugged her.  "I'm glad too.  But I'll be gladder if you come with me and straighten
this mess out with Buffy."</p>

<p>"Only if you promise to move things along with Amy."  Tara giggled when a look of shock
crossed Willow's face.  "Really, you deserve to be happy and so does she."</p>

<p>The two witches got up and headed out of the cemetary in search of their other two
friends.  Willow was secretly hoping to move things along with Amy and Tara was hoping
that no matter what happened, she and Buffy could still remain friends.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>"...so then Riley walked in, and you know the rest."  Buffy and Amy were on patrol.
Things were pretty quiet right now so they were sitting on headstones, opposite each
other.  "But enough about me.  What about you and Will?"</p>

<p>Amy chuckled.  "You sure do change gears quickly.  Well, I don't know really.  We. .
.almost, you know but Tara walked in and we thought that was more important.  I can wait."</p>

<p>"You think?  I mean, Tara did all she could to keep me from knocking both your heads
together and going 'duh. Wake up'."  The Slayer laughed.  "You've always been such a good
friend to her, Amy, I'm glad you found each other at the right time."</p>

<p>"Me too.   And about Tara?  I wouldn't worry.  Will and I have noticed the way she looks
at you.  She'll come around."</p>

<p>Buffy tossed her stake up in the air and caught it again.  "I hope so."</p>

<p>"Hope what?"  Willow asked as she walked up to both of her friends.  Tara was right behind
her.  "And I clearly remember telling you we'd meet you on patrol, not slack time.  What
gives?"</p>

<p>Buffy slid off the headstone and tried not to look too anxious.  "Tara, hey."  She
smiled.  "Can we talk?"</p>

<p>The blonde looked over at Willow who nodded and smiled in reassurance.  She then turned
back to Buffy.  "Sure."</p>

<p>They walked off with Buffy leading the way.</p>

<p>Willow turned to Amy.  "Can you see me?  Cause I distinctly remember a greeting and a
question to my 'best friend', and I waited for a reply but sadly...got no love.  Have I
suddenly become invisible?"</p>

<p>Amy continued to look off in the direction that Buffy and Tara were walking.</p>

<p>Willow suddenly became panicked.  "Oh, no.  I *am* invisible, aren't I?  Cause that's bad,
really bad...it's like Marcie all over again and I'm really, really not good at all at
the covert operation stuff.  I can't even sneak a cookie out of the fridge without Buffy
noticing!  I just knew this would happen some day, I knew it.  No one pays attention to
Willow, no one listens to Willow...I just up and disa-mrumph---"  Willow found a very
soft set of lips pressed against her own...</p>

<p>Amy waited until just the right time to sneak up on her.  She had to time it right so that
Willow was so far into her babble that she wouldn't notice, and not too far into it that
she'd send her flying over one of the headstones.  Timing Willow's babble had become like
an artform and as Amy thuroughly kissed the redhead in front of her, she also
congradulated herself on being a damn good art student.</p>

<p>The kiss deepened gradually, and Willow felt her knees go weak.  Amy compensated by
wrapping her arms around the redhead's waist.  It wasn't an erotice kiss, or a forceful
one.  It was one of those kisses, that when you looked back on it, you just couldn't help
but grin mischieviously.  After a few moments, she pulled away reluctantly, but with a
thousand watt grin plastered across her face.  "Nope, not invisible.  That's for sure."
She placed her forehead against Willows.</p>

<p>Willow tried to force her brain into action.  "No.  Invisible?...not me.  Nope.
Definitly not."</p>

<p>Amy grinned again.  "You don't sound too sure about that, Will.  I think I'll have to
check again...just to make sure."</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Buffy and Tara we sitting under a tree facing each other.  That's about all that had
gotten accomplished so far.  Sitting.</p>

<p>"So, nice night.  Isn't it?"  Buffy started.</p>

<p>Tara nodded.</p>

<p>"Slow patrol night too.  I don't have to worry about getting beat up or tossed or even
shot."  She grinned.</p>

<p>Tara nodded again.</p>

<p>This wasn't going exactly the way the Slayer had hoped it would.  "Tara, about Riley,"</p>

<p>"You don't have to explain.  I understand."  She picked at the grass in front of her.
"I-I know you love him and he, he makes you happy."</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head. "No, that's not what I was gonna say.  I mean, yeah I love him sure,
we were together for over half a year but it's..."  Buffy took Tara's hand.  Tara looked
up when she did this and Buffy continued.  "It's over between Riley and I."</p>

<p>"No, not because of me.  I don't want---"</p>

<p>"Tara, trust me, it's not because of you.  Not entirely anyway.  Riley...Riley has a
very black and white view of the world.  I guess it comes from his training and I really
can't blame him for it.  We've had this problem before.  He just can't accept me for who I
am.  Who I am is the Slayer and I'll be that until the day I die.  He won't...can't
accept the fact that this isn't a choice for me and he doesn't respect that I not only do
it because I have to, but because I want to.  Sure it sucks sometimes and the bad guys get
the upper hand, but that's why I fight harder.  He thinks there's great fun to be had in
demon killing and vamp slayage, but"</p>

<p>"But it's not fun.  You put your life in danger every day.  You get hurt, almost every
night...and didn't Willow tell me you died once?"</p>

<p>"Only for a minute, but yeah."  Buffy squeezed her hand.  "Which brings me to the 'Tara'
part of my breaking up with Riley.  Next to Willow and Xander, you get it.  All of it.
The life of a Scooby, slayage, demons, things that go bump and grr in the night. .
.everything.  You get it.  It may have taken me a while, but I decided that I deserve
someone in my life that understands it.  You, being friends with you, and more than
friends, you made me realize what was missing from my relationship with Riley.  So don't
blame yourself for us breaking up, it was inevitable the way I see it."</p>

<p>Tara blushed.  "Um, more than friends?"</p>

<p>"Yes, more than friends."  Buffy genuinly smiled.  "That is, if you'll have me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course...I wouldn't pass this up for anything.  I wouldn't pass you up."</p>

<p>Buffy leaned over and gave the blonde witch a massive hug.  "Thank God that's over with.
I was so worried that you'd never want to speak to me again."</p>

<p>Tara pulled away a little so she could look into the Slayer's eyes.  "Never.  That would
never happen.  I was scared that, you know...what happened with Willow and I, with Oz?.
. .that it was happening all over again.  I couldn't...I just couldn't handle it."</p>

<p>"You don't have to.  Ever again."  Buffy tucked some stray hair behind the other blondes
ear.  "Not if I can help it."  She suddenly got a mischievious look on her face."  So,
where were we when we were so rudely interruped by my ex-boyfriend."</p>

<p>Tara caught on and blushed a bit.  "Um, I think we were..."  She closed the few inches
left between them.</p>

<hr width=50%>

<p>Willow pulled away from Amy, clearly out of breath.  "As much as I enjoy our new pass time
activity, don't get me wrong, I think we maybe oughta, you know, talk a bit."  She touched
Amy's cheek lightly.</p>

<p>Amy nodded her head.  "Yeah, I was thinking that too.  Well, that and the fact that oxygen
is nice."</p>

<p>Both girls giggled and sat down in the grass.  They looked at each other, then their
surroundings, then back to each other again.  Willow smiled.  "Okay, I guess it's only
fair that I talk since you told me that stuff last night."  Amy nodded.  "I, I don't want
you to think that this is a rebound thing over Tara, cause it's not.  It's not even a
bound thing, not that we ever did that cause I'm too, you know 'Willowy' for it and
besides, Tara's not that flexable...no wait, that didn't sound right!"  she blushed.</p>

<p>"Will, it's okay,"  Amy laughed.  "I don't think it's a rebound.  Really."</p>

<p>The hacker sighed in relief.  "Good.  I would *never* use you like that...ever."</p>

<p>"I know."  She smiled.  "So what is this then?  To you I mean."</p>

<p>"Oh, sure, pull out the tough questions straight away."  Willow smiled.  "When you came
back from being a rat, I mean when the spell *finally* worked, all I could think of was,
'wow, I finally have Amy back and we can do this spell and go here together and have
sleepovers and go to the Bronze and it'll be just like old times.'  The second thought I
had was, 'hey, she's really cute!'"  Willow blushed.  "I...I can't say I never noticed
back in high school cause I did, though if you had asked me I would have denied it
emphatically.  Then when you got hurt by that vampire last night...it kind of cinched it
for me.  It all just got clear.  How I felt about you in high school, God Amy, I was
always looking to you for witchy advice and I'd tell you about how Xander was *so*
clueless and I really admired you for how brave you were when everything happened with
your mom and I always looked forward to our lunches together and our sleepovers and,"  She
shrugged.  "I...I just like you, all around...and I'm finally admitting to my second
crush...which would be you...and I'm stopping now cause there were way too many words
and skeletons in there."  She put her head down in embarassment.</p>

<p>Amy tilted Willow's head up so she could see her face.  "Well, if you ask me, closets are
good for only one thing – clothes."  Amy shifted a little closer to her.  "But...you
know what I think graveyards are good for?"</p>

<p>Willow saw the little glint in her eye and decided to play along.  "Um, patrol?  Picnics?
Demon hunting?  Oh, I know!  Spells...graveyards are definitely good for spells."  She
nodded knowingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you think you're funny.  Don't cha?"  Amy leaned in closer.  "You're a barrel of
laughs, Will, really...but stand-up comedy isn't exactly what I had in mind."  She
leaned in further and kissed her lightly.  "Now that's more like it."</p>

<p>"Less talking.  More kissing."  Willow pulled Amy, who was on her knees, closer and she
lost her balance.  Not that they noticed – they just continued to kiss as if nothing had
happened.  That is until they heard clapping behind them.  They both looked up from the
ground to see Buffy and Tara above them giving them a standing ovation.</p>

<p>"Bravo!"  the Slayer commented.  "Good form.  I'd give it an eight."</p>

<p>Tara was laughing next to her.  "A little messy on the roll over.  I'd give it a seven."
They both stopped clapping when Amy glared at them.</p>

<p>Willow, however, was practically mortified that she got caught kissing by her best friend
and her ex girlfriend.  "I, um, don't. . we weren't uh, that isn't to say that we..."
She gave up and buried her face in Amy's neck.</p>

<p>"What, Will?  You weren't doing exactly what we were just doing not three minutes ago?"
The Slayer smirked.</p>

<p>Willow looked up at both of them who had the tell tale 'make-out' signs written all over
their faces.  Her eyes went wide and she buried her face in Amy's shoulder again.
"Someone hide me.  *Now*."  Came the redhead's muffled reply.</p>

<p>"Ice cream for everyone!  I say our make out, uh, *make-up* session was a complete success
and that is cause to celebrate.  You two in?"  Buffy put her hand out to Amy who took it.</p>

<p>"Um, Will?  In order for me to get up, there has to be a little cooperation on your
part."  Amy smirked.</p>

<p>"Okay."  Willow replied, albeit grudgingly.  "Just when I was gettin comfy too."</p>

<p>Both girls got up and looked to Buffy and Tara who seemed completely satisfied with
themselves.</p>

<p>"I take it your talk went well then?"  Willow asked.</p>

<p>Tara nodded.  "Yeah, really well.  Thanks again, Willow."</p>

<p>"Anytime, Tara.  You know that."  She reached over and hugged her.  "Now did someone
mention ice cream?"  Willow looked over in Buffy's direction.</p>

<p>"Ooh, I did!  Come on.  If we hurry, we can make it before they close."</p>

<p>Buffy took Tara's hand in her own, and Amy did the same with Willow's.  The four of them
headed towards the exit of the graveyard and the beginning of brand new, if not
interesting relationships.  Everything they planned on happening that summer didn't pan
out.  As a matter of fact, everything was almost the exact opposite.  But that was okay
with them.  They wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
