<p>"We're only coming here for the weekend, right?" Amy asked the rest of the group.</p>

<p>"That was the plan." Willow said.</p>

<p>Trekking deep into Breaker's Woods for a camping trip and a little magick practicing didn't sound so bad when they came up with the idea. It sounded peaceful, a way to escape for awhile and get to know one another a little better. Maybe even learn a few new things. Possibly some soul-searching. They were leaving it open.</p>

<p>One thing they didn't count on, was the heaviness of the camping bags. Tents, clothes, food, snacks, magick supplies...only one of them had super strength.</p>

<p>"Then how come it feels like we have enough for a year?" She looked back and saw Buffy and Tara trudging a few feet behind. "Hey Buffy! Can you handle some more weight?"</p>

<p>"Why don't you just say a spell to shrink the bag?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"I'm a witch, not Mary Poppins."</p>

<p>"I think you should talk to the Goddess. Make an appointment or something. Get her to come up with spells that are more practical." The slayer said sarcastically.</p>

<p>"I would, but I hear she's booked through the next millennium."</p>

<p>"Guess simple praying doesn't cut it anymore." Buffy whispered to Tara. "She knows we're joking, right? The Goddess?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure she isn't offended." Tara smiled.</p>

<p>"Good, cause, I wouldn't want to end up a frog or a little, tiny -"</p>

<p>"Frog! Where?" Willow exclaimed frantically, turning around.</p>

<p>The redhead moved so fast, that the quick movement and the weight of the bag knocked her off balance. By the time she realized she was falling backwards, it was too late. First there was a thump, and then she rolled down the small incline, stopping right at Buffy and Tara's feet.</p>

<p>Willow closed her eyes, took a deep breath, then looked at the faces of the amused blondes who were trying *not* to look amused.</p>

<p>"Little help?"</p>

<p>"Looks like you've got it covered, Will." Buffy smiled down at her. "Again, I'd have to give you a six...bad dismount."</p>

<p>"Buffy," Tara looked at her, "that's not nice."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Tara." Willow stuck her tongue out at Buffy. "At least *one* of my friends is concerned for my well being."</p>

<p>"I would give her at least an eight. After all, there was the mention of a frog and all." Tara smirked.</p>

<p>Amy walked up to the three of them and put her hand out to Willow.</p>

<p>"Okay, okay...enough pickin' on the frog fear." She helped her up. "We should get going before it's really dark. Will and I have to do the protection spell before the sun sets."</p>

<p>"Protection spell?" Tara asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah, so we don't get attacked by vamps on a snack run." Willow smiled. "It was Amy's idea. That way we can kick back and not worry about the slayage."</p>

<p>"Oh," Tara nodded, "well, that's cool." She watched Amy and Willow walk ahead. "I could have thought of that." She mumbled under her breath.</p>

<p>"Hey." Buffy put her hand on Tara's shoulder. "I heard that."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Tara, I have Slayer hearing...remember? What gives?"</p>

<p>They walked in silence for a few moments. "I don't know. It's not like I'm jealous...cause I'm not. Not that way anyway. It's just, well, Willow and I used to do spells together. You know, practice and stuff? And we don't now. I miss it." She shrugged. "This weekend was a good idea. Give us all a chance to build a friendship."</p>

<p>Buffy linked her hand with Tara's. "Yeah, I know what you mean. I haven't spent much time with Will because I've been with you. Not that I'm complaining, of course, but still...it'll be nice to be just us girls." Buffy stopped a moment and looked at Tara. "I'm glad things worked out...between you and Will. I mean, that you're still able to be friends after everything."</p>

<p>"I'm glad too. She's important to me, you know, in that witchy bond sort of way. Plus, she gets my jokes, which is always a plus."</p>

<p>"Hey! I get your jokes."</p>

<p>"Not all of them, but...you're getting better. It only took two books to explain the karma thing."</p>

<p>"I think I'm vaguely insulted." Buffy pouted. "I think."</p>

<p>Tara leaned in and kissed her. "Better?"</p>

<p>The slayer smiled. "Much." She leaned in for another kiss, but...</p>

<p>"Are you two coming, or are you gonna give Mother Nature a show?" Amy stood about ten feet away with her hands on her hips, smirking.</p>

<p>Buffy rolled her eyes. "Coming 'mom'." She took Tara's hand and they joined Amy.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy was setting up the tents, Tara watching her closely. The spot they picked was nice. Beautiful, in fact. Decent size clearing, and a lot of light was getting through the trees, shining down on them. Very quiet and serene. Flowers everywhere, too. If any one of them had allergies, they'd find out soon enough.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you don't need any help?" The blonde wicca was concerned.</p>

<p>"Yes. Positive." Buffy jammed the pole into the ground, and turned toward her girlfriend. "Go do magick with them. I know you want to."</p>

<p>"I don't...wanna get in their way."</p>

<p>"They want you over there. Go."</p>

<p>Tara took the not so subtle hint and made her way over to where Willow and Amy were unpacking. Willow stood up, holding a candle in her hand.</p>

<p>"Why does incense have to be so smelly?" She realized Tara was right by her. "Tara! Great! We need a third, powerful wicca to do this. And you fit the requirements. No, you're better than the requirements, even."</p>

<p>"No I'm not..." She blushed.</p>

<p>"You are and you know it. With you we'll have super duper strong vampire protection. If we didn't, it'd be like settling for a bulletproof vest made out of cotton candy. Really won't do much except...be eatable. You in?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah, you bet." Tara smiled.</p>

<p>"Cool. Hey, how about we go to a carnival next weekend?"</p>

<p>As Buffy watched them perform the spell, while trying to put up the tents, she thought to herself that she was the one in the way. Not Tara. There were three witches, but she was the only slayer. And it's not like she could just call up another slayer. The only one she knew of was Faith, and the girl was behind bars. She was glad for that, mainly because she didn't want the brunette coming after her friends again.</p>

<p>Plus, she remembered what Faith had said to Tara while Faith was in her body (it was still her brain, and she got the memories). Faith wasn't very nice, and Tara had been uncomfortable and hurt. She wouldn't let that happen again.</p>

<p>She hoped Faith could serve her time and get redemption, even with Angel's help, but she still had trouble believing her. Faith had admitted to her acting talents when Buffy was chained to the wall of the mansion. How could she trust or believe the other slayer ever again?</p>

<p>The thing that really stunk was, as much as she wanted to stay away from Faith, a whole other part of her wanted to work things out. She still had large amounts of guilt, and a little piece of her was destroyed when Faith switched sides. She may not have shown it well, and that was her mistake, but having the other girl's friendship meant a lot. She liked her, they had fun together.</p>

<p>In their last conversation, Faith wanted to know how to make it better. She sounded sincere, too. Yet, again, even though Buffy wanted to, she couldn't bring herself to go to LA. There was doubt in her mind. But what if Faith couldn't totally heal unless they talked?</p>

<p>"This isn't why you're here. And thinking about it isn't going to do anything." Buffy told herself.</p>

<p>'No, this is why you're here, remember?' Her brain was saying. 'To figure things out. But you're right. Thinking about it won't help. Action will.'</p>

<p>"Spell's finished." Tara said.</p>

<p>Buffy snapped back to reality, and smiled.</p>

<p>"So we won't be interrupted?" She had a small grin on her face.</p>

<p>"Uh...uh. uh..." The witch hadn't stuttered in a long time. "Nope. Well, not as long as you get...the tents up."</p>

<p>"Trying. But I still don't want help."</p>

<p>"If you say so." Tara was quiet for a moment. "What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"Huh? Oh. Nothing."</p>

<p>"Buffy, you may have Slayer Hearing, but I have Witch Intuition."</p>

<p>"Really?" Her interest was piqued.</p>

<p>"Um... no. But I do have 'Tara Intuition'."</p>

<p>Buffy walked up to her. "And what makes you think anything is wrong? We're here, communing with nature," She wrapped her arms around Tara's waist, "and with each other. What could *possibly* be wrong?"</p>

<p>Tara smiled and shook her head. "Oh, no...you're not going to distract me that easily."</p>

<p>Buffy leaned in and kissed her cheek. "No?" Then her nose. "You don't think so?" Then she finally kissed her lips, but pulled away after a few moments. "How was that?" She whispered.</p>

<p>"That was...wow." Tara blushed and cleared her throat. "But you're still gonna tell me what's wrong." She smirked and pulled away from the slayer slightly. "You have 'worry face', which gives me 'worry face', and that's never good."</p>

<p>"Am I interrupting?" Willow walked up next to them.</p>

<p>"Yes." Tara said.</p>

<p>"No." Buffy said at the same time.</p>

<p>"Wow, déjà vu." She smiled. "Amy and I were wondering if you guys were hungry. We put some logs on for a fire. I heard it's supposed to be a little cold out tonight."</p>

<p>"Sure, firey fun sounds like my cup of tea right now." Buffy smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. We have to keep you away from matches. Remember?" Willow smirked, then turned to Tara. "Did she ever tell you about the time she burned down the gym of her old high school?"</p>

<p>"You what?" Tara looked to Buffy.</p>

<p>"It was full of vampires, okay?" Buffy looked over at Willow, who had the most satisfied grin on her face. "Are we going to tell embarrassing stories all night? Cause you know, there's a few I can come up with on my own, Will."</p>

<p>"Shutting up now."</p>

<p>"I thought so."</p>

<p>"Okay...so, fire, marshmallows, songs around the camp fire...oh! And we can't forget the witchy factor. Tomorrow night is the full moon, you know. Great time for some spell casting fun. What are we waiting for?"</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"...but you *had* to see the outfit!" Buffy leaned back against Tara, trying not to laugh. "I mean, it was something out of Fredricks of Hollywood."</p>

<p>Willow pouted. "Yeah, well, are we forgetting that I didn't have much of a choice in wearing it? Um, hello? Big evil, skanky vampire me was trying to take over the town! We had to do something."</p>

<p>"I'm sure it was very brave of you, Will." Amy put her arm around her girlfriend's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Why thank you."</p>

<p>"I'll bet it was really scary putting all that leather on at once. I mean, a bunch of PETA activists could have attacked at any moment and..."</p>

<p>"Hey! You're not being helpful, supportive girlfriend person."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry." Amy kissed her on the cheek. "But you're just so cute when you get all flustered and defensive and babbley."</p>

<p>"I'm not babbley! Defensive yes, because my *supposed* best friend is drudging up all the dirt on me. And what's with that, anyway? You don't see me mentioning the whole kissing Spike thing, which by the way, ewww...not to mention the whole undead factor that you seem to be quite fond of and..."</p>

<p>"Okay, okay, okay...truce?" Buffy offered quickly.</p>

<p>Willow smiled. "Truce."</p>

<p>"But not before I remind you that it was one of *your* spells that had me locking lips with Billy Idol."</p>

<p>"I admit that I was a little...irresponsible, but it didn't make you kiss Billy Idol. He doesn't even live...oh."</p>

<p>"Let's play truth or dare." Amy said wickedly.</p>

<p>"How old are we?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Hey, in my mind, I'm still eighteen. Consequence of being a rat for two years."</p>

<p>"And whose fault is that?" She teased.</p>

<p>"I think she's just afraid, Will."</p>

<p>"You know what? I think she is too." Willow agreed.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid." Tara comforted her with a small grin.</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid!" Buffy practically screamed.</p>

<p>Willow looked around the clearing. "I think you made the forest animals afraid. Poor rabbits."</p>

<p>"We're playing. I'm going first." The slayer challenged them with her eyes. "Let's get started. Willow," The redhead gulped, "truth or dare?"</p>

<p>"Tr...truth."</p>

<p>Buffy thought long and hard, and her target was beginning to sweat. When she was ready, her face gave nothing away.</p>

<p>"Did you enjoy your vamp double's affection?"</p>

<p>Tara and Amy stared at Willow.</p>

<p>"Her outfit, uh...no! I mean...she was evil and...no! It was...wrong, confusing, disgusting, gross, and of course I didn't! Not even when she -" She cut herself off, and paled.</p>

<p>"When she what?"</p>

<p>"My turn." Willow said quickly.</p>

<p>It was Buffy's turn to pale. "Just remember how much you love me."</p>

<p>"Uh huh. Truth or dare...Tara."</p>

<p>"Um, I uh," The blonde witch was fully expecting to watch Buffy and Willow trade truths for at least two more turns. Now she knew how Willow felt moments before. "Okay, I pick truth."</p>

<p>"Hmmm," Willow put on her 'concentration face'. She knew Tara fairly well, but there was one thing that she was really curious about. "Why don't you ever talk about your family?"</p>

<p>"My family," Tara ducked her head shyly, trying to find the words. She could lie, but that wouldn't be fair to her friends. "I haven't seen them in over two years. There was, um, a lot that happened when my mom died. I was a freshman. I haven't been home since." She shrugged.</p>

<p>Willow frowned. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you talk about it. I thought, well, I didn't know that...sorry."</p>

<p>"It's okay. I just don't talk about it much is all."</p>

<p>"When you were a freshman?" Buffy looked at her quizzically.</p>

<p>"Um, yeah. I'm a junior." She smiled down at her girlfriend. "You knew that, didn't you?" Buffy shook her head no. "All this time and you didn't know I was a year older than you?" The slayer nodded. Tara gave her a little squeeze then. "Truth or dare, Buffy?"</p>

<p>"Uh...truth seems to be on special tonight, so..."</p>

<p>"What's wrong? And you can't lie, either. Remember, 'Tara Intuition.' Plus, I'm older."</p>

<p>"Why does it make a difference if you're older than me or not?"</p>

<p>"Cause, there's a rule." Tara looked to Willow. "Right, Will?"</p>

<p>"Uh, yeah...the um, older rule." She nodded. "Sure."</p>

<p>"So?" Tara looked down at Buffy.</p>

<p>As they waited for her response, it dawned on Willow what had her friend preoccupied. She had seen that expression too many times.</p>

<p>"It's Faith, isn't it?" She asked. "You're having psycho slayer thoughts."</p>

<p>"Since I didn't really answer the question, does it mean I have to go again?" Buffy tried to joke.</p>

<p>Tara frowned. "You want closure."</p>

<p>Her girlfriend nodded, and grabbed her hand. "I guess I didn't wanna bring it up cause I know your experience with Faith has been less than pleasant."</p>

<p>"Hasn't been very pleasant for any of us." Willow commented, anger showing on her face. Her expression softened though, looking at her best friend. "But I understand. You and Faith have things left...unsettled. Closure would help."</p>

<p>Amy raised her hand. "I kinda missed out on the whole dark slayer thing."</p>

<p>"Be glad."</p>

<p>"Maybe we should stop." Tara suggested, thinking the middle of the night wasn't the best time to talk about such a touchy subject.</p>

<p>"Yeah." Buffy said. She didn't have the energy. "Right after Amy and I have a little chat. Truth or dare?"</p>

<p>"Dare." The witch said with confidence.</p>

<p>"I dare you to tell me that you really don't remember seeing anything from your time as a rat. Sitting in that cage, great view of Willow's bedroom...be honest now."</p>

<p>"That's not fair, Buffy." Amy glared, being caught off guard.</p>

<p>"We're waiting."</p>

<p>She stared at the ground. "I remember everything. I saw...everything."</p>

<p>Willow gasped. "You said -"</p>

<p>"Don't be mad. I said I had a crush on you in high school, and that's true, but when I became four-legged, watched you and listened to you in that cage, it became more than a crush. I fell in love with you, and I couldn't do anything about it. It sucked, but I promised myself when I got human again, that I'd tell you how I felt and see what happened. Now I've got you, and I can't believe it."</p>

<p>The redhead was speechless. She had tears. It was complete sappiness, but it was the sweetest thing any of them had ever heard. The fact that Amy thought all of that about Willow while she was a rodent, didn't seem to matter.</p>

<p>"I give that a ten. What do you think, Tara?" Buffy sniffled.</p>

<p>She nodded. "I think I need tissues. That alone gives it an eleven."</p>

<p>"Okay, what is it with you guys and scoring every thing we -" Amy was silenced by Willow's lips covering hers. What followed was a rather passionate make out session.</p>

<p>The two blondes turned away, clearing their throats. When Willow finished, Amy was struggling to remember how to breathe.</p>

<p>"I love you." Willow whispered. "That was nicest thing anybody's ever...thank you so much."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't I be the one doing the thanking?"</p>

<p>"You tired, Tara? I'm ready to hit the hay."</p>

<p>Buffy stood up, and Tara wordlessly followed the slayer's example. They rushed to their tent then, and Amy and Willow looked on as they disappeared inside it. After a minute or so, Buffy poked her head out.</p>

<p>"Night guys!"</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy and Tara lay side by side in silence. It was nice and cozy and...very new. Like first time new. Which would explain why they were under their respective sleeping bags with their hands at their sides.</p>

<p>"This is crazy." Buffy finally said and turned to Tara. "We cuddle all the time. We're never cuddle free. So why is it so hard now?"</p>

<p>Tara frowned. "I don't know. Maybe because it's...an extended cuddle, where there's sleep involved in the middle."</p>

<p>"You and Will, you used to...never mind. I'm sorry." Buffy turned again and laid on her back. "It's none of my business."</p>

<p>"No, we did, I mean, you know...it was just different, that's all." Tara shrugged.</p>

<p>"Different how?"</p>

<p>"You're not...Willow." She said quietly. "It's just different. Every relationship is. Kinda like your relationship with Willow is different from, let's say, yours and Faith's."</p>

<p>Buffy sighed. "I thought we were talking about us?"</p>

<p>"You want to talk to her."</p>

<p>"I didn't say that. I said I wanted to cuddle." She sighed again. "Oh, who am I kidding? I just...argh! Why is this so difficult? Why should I even care? I mean, she attacks my friends, holds my mother hostage, steals my body, tries to kill my boyfriend, gets into cahoots with the big, evil mayor snake and *still* I feel guilty."</p>

<p>Tara blinked a few times at the rush of words and emotion that came from her girlfriend. "Wow. That was Willow-babble worthy." She smiled, but Buffy didn't smile back. "Sorry, probably not a good time for jokes." She reached over and touched Buffy's arm to get her to look at her. "You love her."</p>

<p>Buffy raised an eyebrow. "Willow?"</p>

<p>"Her too, but I mean Faith, silly. You love her, that's why it hurts so much, that's why you feel so guilty."</p>

<p>The Slayer shook her head. "Nuh uh. No way."</p>

<p>"There are different kinds of love, Buffy. There's a bond between you two that's been there since before you were both born. You can't change that, even if you wanted to. You're like...sisters in arms. It's a slayer thing. You said that to Willow once, and it's true."</p>

<p>Buffy took a few moments to think over everything Tara said. "I guess you're right. I feel responsible for her, like...like a sister. The whole Slayer thing, it's hard to deal with, hard to understand sometimes, even for me. Faith got it, she knew how I felt, and that made me feel..."</p>

<p>"Less alone." Tara smiled at her.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Something like that." The Slayer shrugged. "But even though she...I mean, I don't feel lonely with you."</p>

<p>"That makes me happy. But you should go see her."</p>

<p>"I've been thinking about it, but..."</p>

<p>"But what? You're only making it harder than it really has to be. Either you want closure and want to forgive her or you don't and you want to make her suffer some more. Either way, you know you want to see her."</p>

<p>"Even after everything she's done to me and my family and friends, I still want to see her. How crazy is that?"</p>

<p>"That's not crazy, Buffy. That's love. Unconditional."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"You think Buffy will be okay?" Amy asked as she got into her sleeping bag.</p>

<p>"Yeah. I mean, Buffy can handle things. Sure she's new, I mean, so am I. Granted I have a little bit more experience with stuff like this, but I'm sure she'll be fine. You think she'll be fine? Maybe I should go check on her, give her a few pointers? Wait, no that would just be...creepy..."</p>

<p>"Will." Amy smiled at her girlfriend. "I meant with the whole Faith thing. Not with..."</p>

<p>"Oh." Willow blushed. "I thought you meant...never mind."</p>

<p>"She seemed really, I don't know...disturbed by it or, conflicted."</p>

<p>"Yeah, well...she really trusted Faith. They slayed together and everything and she turned around and stabbed Buffy in the back. Well, not literally. Buffy did the stabbing but still, she turned all Dark Slayer on the Scoobies and that's not cool. We accepted her and she ran off with the Mayor to try and take over...not to mention the whole killing a human thing and trying to dust Angel."</p>

<p>"I really missed a lot...didn't I?"</p>

<p>Willow nodded. "Yeah, bunches even."</p>

<p>"Care to fill me in?" Amy said as she snuggled up to Willow. "Bedtime story?"</p>

<p>Willow smiled at her girlfriend and kissed her forehead. "More like nightmare story. You sure you wanna..."</p>

<p>They both froze when they heard a sound come from outside the tent. It was like branches breaking underfoot and someone moving through bushes.</p>

<p>"What was that?" Amy whispered.</p>

<p>"I dunno." Willow sat up and started to look for the flashlight. She froze when the noise came again, only this time it was louder. "Okay, whoever's out there...this isn't funny." She found the flashlight and clicked it on. It didn't work. "Oh great. I should have known." She rolled her eyes. "That better not be you Buffy, cause if it is I'll, I'll...well, I'll have to think of something really mean and witchy to do to you," Willow grabbed for Amy's hand, "*after* I stop shaking that is." She added as an afterthought.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Tara?"</p>

<p>"Hmm?"</p>

<p>Buffy rolled over on her side. "How did we get from cuddling to psycho slayer talk? Did I skip a chapter or something?"</p>

<p>The blonde witch chuckled. "No."</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>Tara opened one eye. "So what?"</p>

<p>The Slayer smirked. "Do I get an invite or would you like to sleep alone on this cold evening?"</p>

<p>"I thought only vampires needed invitations?"</p>

<p>"Tara!"</p>

<p>"Hey, how come your hair's been getting darker lately? Do you dye it?" The slayer glared. "Okay, okay." She smiled and unzipped her sleeping bag. "I invite you, to um, cuddle."</p>

<p>Buffy slipped into the sleeping bag and zipped it back up. She put her arm around Tara, who snuggled down and put her arm across Buffy's stomach. "That wasn't so hard, now was it?"</p>

<p>Tara gave Buffy a little squeeze and looked up at her. "You let the cold air in."</p>

<p>Buffy opened her mouth for a witty retort, but a scream cut through the air, stopping her. She sat up immediately. "That was Willow!"</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Tara and Buffy ran outside to see Amy and Willow shaking, staring into the night. The blonde witch accidentally stepped on a branch, causing the frightened couple to jump and face them. Willow looked like she was about to have a heart attack.</p>

<p>"Sorry." Tara apologized guiltily.</p>

<p>"Are you okay? What happened?" Buffy asked, scanning the darkness.</p>

<p>"We heard a noise, and we came out here." Amy began to explain. "We couldn't see anything, but the flashlight wouldn't work..."</p>

<p>"But you put new batteries in before we left, Will. Didn't you?"</p>

<p>The redhead nodded. "I figured it was just our imaginations, the woods are scary at night, at least to me. Getting told ghost stories as a kid about men with hooks, an evil Tinkerbell, and tree people can really affect you later in life."</p>

<p>"Tree people?"</p>

<p>"Evil Tinkerbell?" Tara questioned.</p>

<p>"Tell them." Amy said, trying to calm her girlfriend down.</p>

<p>"My cousin told me about NeverNeverHell where Peter Pan was a -" Willow started.</p>

<p>"No, about what happened to the flashlight."</p>

<p>"Oh. Right." Willow smiled sheepishly. "Something ripped it right out of my hands, and it made me fall." She frowned and spoke to Amy in that innocent, 'little girl' voice. "I coulda hurt my bottom."</p>

<p>"I would've made it better. Maybe I should just check..."</p>

<p>Buffy cleared her throat. "Focus?"</p>

<p>"Focused." Amy swore.</p>

<p>"Did you see it?" The two witches shook their heads.</p>

<p>"Whatever it was, it's gone now." Tara said, looking around. "We should just try and go to sleep."</p>

<p>"You sure?"</p>

<p>"It's still in the woods, but it won't come back tonight."</p>

<p>Buffy had come to trust Tara's internal, maybe magickal, radar.</p>

<p>"I'll go searching in the morning. Will you two be okay?"</p>

<p>"Think so." Willow told her, and Amy nodded in confirmation.</p>

<p>"You need us, we're the next tent over." She stared at her friend, and gave her hand a squeeze.</p>

<p>"Night, Buff."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The couples' separated, and as they re-entered their tent, Buffy let Tara get in the bag first, as she zipped up the front of the tent.</p>

<p>"Maybe it was Spike messing around. He could have followed us out here and just decided to be an asshole." She said, liking that explanation a lot.</p>

<p>"Protection spell remember? Vampires can't get anywhere near this clearing."</p>

<p>The slayer frowned, slipping in beside the witch. "I was hoping it would be something easy."</p>

<p>"At least we ruled out something."</p>

<p>"Uh huh. And how many species of demon are there?"</p>

<p>"I guess that really doesn't help."</p>

<p>Buffy laid her head on Tara's chest.</p>

<p>"How can you just...tell things sometimes? Magick?"</p>

<p>The blonde started brushing the other girl's hair with her fingers without even realizing it, trying to think of the best way to explain.</p>

<p>"Ever see Good Will Hunting?"</p>

<p>"Movie with Matt Damon and Ben Whatshisname?"</p>

<p>"That's the one."</p>

<p>"Yeah. They were nice pieces of eye candy."</p>

<p>"I'll pretend I didn't hear that. For guys though, they aren't bad." They both grinned. "Anyway, do you remember that scene where Minnie Driver asks Matt Damon how he could do all that math and stuff?"</p>

<p>"Uh...yeah."</p>

<p>"He told her that it's like those piano players who just know how to play without really needing to be taught. He could always do math, learning came easy, he just knew. Not an exact quote, but...what I'm trying to say is that I've always been able to feel things. I don't know why, or what it is, I'm not even describing it right, but it's always been there. Do you understand at all?"</p>

<p>"Kinda...a little...well, more than I did." Buffy looked at her without lifting up her head, and could see upset-ness in Tara's face. "But I don't need to. You've got a gift, you're special, and I'm with you. That's enough for me."</p>

<p>"Willow used to talk about you all the time before we met each other. She wanted me to like you, and understand just how important you are in her life. She told me how great you were, how nice, and how much you do for people. But, and don't get me wrong, cause I think Willow's the coolest, she didn't do you justice."</p>

<p>The slayer raised up slightly, just so she could accept her girlfriend's kiss.</p>

<p>"Does that mean you like me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I think it means I love you."</p>

<p>"Even better. I love you too." She reclaimed her pillow. "Goodnight, Tara."</p>

<p>"Have good dreams, Buffy."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Will. Come back here. I'm cold." Amy pouted.</p>

<p>Willow was currently poking her head outside the tent for the fourth time since they got back. She could swear she'd heard something again. She turned back to her girlfriend and frowned. "But..."</p>

<p>"No buts, Will. Now come on. You're letting the skeeters in."</p>

<p>"Okay, since you look so cute when you pout and everything. How can I resist?" She zipped the tent up and crawled in next to Amy in the sleeping bag. "Better?"</p>

<p>Amy smiled down at her. "Much." She kissed her forehead. "Night, Wills."</p>

<p>"Night, Ammers."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Tara rolled over and stretched. She opened her eyes to find...nothing. She was alone. "Buffy?" She called out. No answer.</p>

<p>She got up, dressed and opened the tent, blinking in the sunlight. "Wow, bright."</p>

<p>"Usually is in the morning."</p>

<p>Tara turned around to find Buffy standing behind her. "Hey. You were gone."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I figured I'd look around. See what the bumpy thing in the night was, but I came up with nada. Guess bumpy things in the night like to creep around, you know, at night."</p>

<p>Tara smiled and nodded. "Yeah."</p>

<p>Buffy walked up to her and gave her a hug. "Good morning, by the way." She noticed that Tara was a little stiff. "What's wrong?"</p>

<p>"You, you were g-gone. I was worried." She looked down.</p>

<p>"Hey." Buffy lifted her chin with her finger. "I'm right here." She whispered.</p>

<p>Tara looked at her with sadness. "I know, but...that thing last night. It wasn't...I mean, it's not...it's not normal." She shrugged. "But I guess that goes without saying."</p>

<p>"Is this one of those 'feeling' things? Like you know it was dangerous?"</p>

<p>Tara nodded. "I just don't want you to get hurt. Any more than you'd have to, you know, being the Slayer and everything."</p>

<p>"Hey, guys. What's up?" Amy walked up from behind them. She saw the look on Tara's face. "Uh oh. I'm interrupting, aren't I?"</p>

<p>Buffy smiled. "It's okay, Amy. Just give us a few minutes?" After she walked away, Buffy turned her attention back to her girlfriend. "Thank you."</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"For being so worried about me, but I'm okay, really. It's just part of the job description, I guess. Looking for evil things in the woods. Most people run in terror, I go chasing after the damn things." She smirked, which made Tara smile. "That's better. I missed that this morning."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Your smile." Buffy kissed her softly. "I really wanted to be there when you woke up because it was our first time spending the night together, but, duty called. You understand. Don't you?"</p>

<p>Tara nodded. "I do. Besides, there will be other nights."</p>

<p>Buffy got a mischievous gleam in her eye and pulled Tara close. "Ooh, promise?"</p>

<p>Tara leaned over and whispered in Buffy's ear. "You can count on it, Slayer." Then she removed herself from Buffy's arms and walked towards where Willow and Amy were preparing breakfast.</p>

<p>Buffy stood there with a shocked look on her face for a few moments, and then followed suit.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"It's official. Amy is the Queen of Pancakes." Buffy said, rubbing her stomach with a small burp. "Excuse me." She blushed.</p>

<p>"My subjects were more than happy to sacrifice themselves to your stomach." Amy said with a smile.</p>

<p>"You should take over IHOP. You could change the name to AHOP." Willow said. They all looked at her, Amy the only one smirking. "Amy's House of Pancakes?"</p>

<p>"What's the original name stand for?" Tara asked.</p>

<p>"International House of Pancakes."</p>

<p>"Oh. Then that was funny."</p>

<p>"I thought so." Willow huffed.</p>

<p>"It was, Will. We just didn't know that the letters meant something. It's our fault for being ignorant when it comes to restaurant names." Buffy explained.</p>

<p>"And the exact words to The Flintstones theme song." Tara said. "Don't know that either."</p>

<p>"Yeah, what are the words?"</p>

<p>"Flintstones, meet the Flintstones, they're the modern stone-age family," Amy began to sing.</p>

<p>Willow joined in.</p>

<p>"From the town of Bedrock, they're a page right out of history, let's ride with the family down the street, through the courtesy of Fred's two feet, when you're with the Flintstones, have a yabba-dabba-doo time, a dabba-doo time, you'll have a gay old time!"</p>

<p>The two singers burst into giggles, and for a minute, the listeners just stared at them like they were strange, but then they started laughing as well. Willow got control of herself first, and looked at her friends.</p>

<p>"Are you laughing at us?"</p>

<p>"No." Tara shook her head. "But it's obvious you watched a lot of Hanna Barbara." She felt a new wave coming on.</p>

<p>"Then what...?" Amy asked.</p>

<p>"'Gay old time'?" Buffy pointed out. Their faces were blank. "Think about it."</p>

<p>Willow paled, while Amy added her own laughter to the mix.</p>

<p>"But that's not what they meant." The redhead said, insisting.</p>

<p>"We know. It means happy." Her girlfriend said. "But the situation is just -"</p>

<p>"Well, there you go. We're happy, aren't we?" Buffy asked. "Completely happy. And we're just having one hell of a gay old time."</p>

<p>"Uh," Tara was smirking in her own unique way, "you know, I always wondered about Fred and Barney. They s-spent a lot of time together, d-didn't they?" She was nervous about how her joke would go over.</p>

<p>Willow broke into a grin, and nearly fell because she started laughing so hard. Amy had to catch her. The four people's sounds of amusement echoed through the woods, and in response, a loud shriek resounded off the trees.</p>

<p>"I think that's my cue to go searching again." Buffy said after a moment. "Wider area this time."</p>

<p>"Maybe you should stay here." Tara suggested. "Let it come to you."</p>

<p>"We already had this talk, remember?" Buffy said softly.</p>

<p>Willow and Amy started cleaning up, letting their friends' converse.</p>

<p>"It just...it doesn't sound very nice."</p>

<p>"They never do."</p>

<p>Tara figured that compromising might work.</p>

<p>"What if you get hurt and we don't know? If you really need to go, let us come with you."</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head. "I'm not putting anyone in danger if I don't have to. I don't want you going for the same reasons you don't want me going. I know you could probably take care of yourself, and you know I can usually take care of myself, but it's a 'girlfriend concern' thing."</p>

<p>"What am I supposed to do? I wanna feel useful, and I'm gonna lose my mind."</p>

<p>"You should stay here. If something does happen, you guys know your way back. You can get help." The other girl still looked upset. More so than she had mere seconds ago. "Come here."</p>

<p>She hugged the witch tightly, and they stayed like that for what seemed like an eternity.</p>

<p>"I won't go far. And you'll be able to find me, right?"</p>

<p>"I'll try." Tara promised.</p>

<p>"Only if you think I'm in trouble, k? Please." She got a nod, and they broke off their embrace. "I'm outta here, then."</p>

<p>Willow came running up. "Be careful, Buffy. I mean it. I've learned to not argue, but if we lose you, you'll be missed. A lot." The slayer smiled at the concern, but quirked an eyebrow at her friend's extra worry. "Ever since I saw the Blair Witch Project, well, Amy had to drag me out here. Not that I'm not enjoying myself. I am. Except for that thing giving me the creeps and the flashlight going whoosh -"</p>

<p>"Hurry back." Amy advised, stopping the redhead's babble.</p>

<p>"I'll be back by lunch." Buffy said with a reassuring glance in Tara's direction.</p>

<p>"It'll be waiting on the table...err...ground. On the blanket that's on the ground." Amy smiled. "There. That works. More sanitary."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Tara?"</p>

<p>"Hey."</p>

<p>"Hey." Amy walked up next to her and put her hand on her shoulder. "She'll be okay, you know. She knows how to handle herself."</p>

<p>Tara nodded and smiled. "I know."</p>

<p>"In the meantime, why don't you come over to the campfire? Will and I brought some of our new spell books and there's a few of them we'd like to try, but not without you, of course."</p>

<p>"Thanks. For including me, I mean. I know you and Willow, you have a strong relationship from high school, and..."</p>

<p>"No, Tara. I'm the one who should be thanking you. For a lot of things really, but most of all for being there for Willow. She told me everything, you know...about Oz. I still can't believe he did that to her. You're still special to her, you know?"</p>

<p>Tara smiled. "Yeah, and she's special to me too. I think, if I didn't know her, I wouldn't be where I am. Not only with witchcraft, but, with my life. She's helped me. More than she even knows."</p>

<p>"Hey you two." Willow walked up next to them. "My ears are ringing. You wouldn't happen to be having a pow wow about lil' ol' me now would you?"</p>

<p>Amy and Tara looked at each other and smiled then looked away.</p>

<p>"Uh, guys, I was only kidding."</p>

<p>Amy put her arm around her girlfriend. "No worries, Will. Nothing but good stuff here. Right Tara?"</p>

<p>Tara nodded. "Right. Hey, didn't you say something about doing spells?"</p>

<p>"Yeah!" Willow grabbed Tara and Amy's hands. "Come on, let's go."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Come out, come out wherever you are." Buffy said to whatever might have been listening.</p>

<p>She hated playing the hunter when she didn't have a clue where her prey was or what it looked like. It could've been watching her right then, and she would be completely unaware. So really, that made her *the hunted*, not the hunter. She was the prey, but sometimes it was necessary for a slayer to maintain a certain level of delusion. It was a confidence builder. Made her think she was in control.</p>

<p>How come that made her think of Faith? Because Faith told her she always had to be in control. That she couldn't handle things otherwise. It was true, but the dark-haired slayer had made it sound like a bad thing. It wasn't a bad thing. It had gotten her far. And where had Faith gotten? In jail, that's where.</p>

<p>"Okay, so maybe she went there by choice, but still." She said to herself.</p>

<p>She was judging Faith without knowing anything about how she grew up. She could tell the girl had been traumatized. The lack of control probably wasn't all her fault.</p>

<p>"Enough about her, you're in a life-threatening sitch here, so get it together."</p>

<p>'You could use her help.'</p>

<p>"Don't you think I know that? My brain is a pain in the ass sometimes. It even makes me talk to myself."</p>

<p>'It's not just your mind. You've got generations behind you, and when we see a sister in need, we want to help.'</p>

<p>Buffy stopped dead in her tracks.</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>'Slayers. We're with you always. Since your birth. We live within you. But you only recently opened up the lines of communication. You've opened yourself.'</p>

<p>"Great. In the movie, they didn't start going insane until they were lost. Damn it, does this mean I'm...freaked now." She sat on the ground. "Just stay put. No more walking. You think I'd have a better sense of direction. Good thing I'm the only person who doesn't know where she is."</p>

<p>There was another shriek. It sounded closer this time. Calming herself, she concentrated on the noises of the forest, and waited for the attack.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Tara! Buffy told you -" Willow started saying as they chased after the blonde witch.</p>

<p>She was scared. Buffy wasn't back yet, and she should have been. Tara had gotten up without a word, and started heading into the woods.</p>

<p>"I know what she said. But it's after two. Lunch was o-over a long time ago."</p>

<p>They knew she was right.</p>

<p>"Do you at least know where you're going?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"You think so?" Amy asked incredulously. She had thought to grab the magick supplies, and was carrying them on her back.</p>

<p>"I'll find my way. You should stay b-behind. I won't let her get hurt." Tara swore.</p>

<p>"No way." Willow said. She regarded her friend thoughtfully. "You love her, huh?"</p>

<p>"You didn't think I did?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know...what I thought, I guess. We're not around you guys much. But it's good that you both...that's great."</p>

<p>"When we get out of here, that's gonna change." Amy said. "The 'not hanging' thing."</p>

<p>Tara stopped, turned and smiled. She could still see the camp.</p>

<p>"Last chance to go back."</p>

<p>They held their arms out, and Tara began leading.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy sat Indian style with her hands on her knees. She breathed deeply. In and out. In and out. In and out. There was an amazing feeling that came over her every time she meditated. It was something she'd never quite known before. It was peace. Like this, with nothing distracting her, she was at peace with herself and everything around her.</p>

<p>It was the opposite when she slayed, or even went through everyday activities. She was constantly in a state of motion, her brain always at work.</p>

<p>Granted, the middle of the woods with an unknown beasty lurking about, wasn't exactly the best place to find peace, but it was what she felt like she had to do. She inhaled deeply again and concentrated. She could almost 'see' her surroundings. There was no way to describe it. It was almost like that silly training activity Giles had her do one time. Hit him with a ball without looking. She did, right on his head, if she remembered correctly, but if anyone had asked her *how* she did it, she really couldn't explain.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"I think we're lost."</p>

<p>Tara looked back at Amy. "We're not lost."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I just do. That's all."</p>

<p>"That was kind of parental. Like when your parents say, 'Because I said so, that's why'. Like they don't want you to know what's really going on, and that's really annoying sometimes...you know? Or when your mom..."</p>

<p>"Amy." Willow put her hand on her shoulder. "Leave the nervous babble to me. Okay? We're fine, really, honest! Right Tara?"</p>

<p>The blonde witch paused a moment, and looked at her surroundings. "I think we're lost."</p>

<p>"We're not lost. We can't be lost." Willow responded reassuringly.</p>

<p>"That's it. We're officially lost. Do you think there are bears in these woods? Cause, bears? Not tops on my list for mingling. Uh uh, no way." Amy was adamant.</p>

<p>Tara closed her eyes and took a deep breath. She tried to concentrate on where they were, where Buffy was, and if Buffy was okay. She opened her eyes and turned around.</p>

<p>"This way." She pointed.</p>

<p>The other two wiccans had no choice but to follow.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>'You simply...are.'</p>

<p>"What's that supposed to mean?"</p>

<p>'It means, you exist. Simply that. You serve a purpose, you do a job, and you have a destiny and a higher purpose. All the slayers before couldn't achieve that. You will.'</p>

<p>"How can I do something that no one's ever done before?"</p>

<p>'Because you can.'</p>

<p>"Oh, great. Now the slayers in my head are beginning to sound like my mother."</p>

<p>Buffy stopped her inner banter for a moment and listened. There was something close...very close...so close it was going to...</p>

<p>"Ow!"</p>

<p>After she flipped whatever it was that was behind her, over her head and in front of her onto its back, Buffy opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"Tara!" She scrambled over to the blonde. "Are you okay?"</p>

<p>"Depends on what you mean by 'okay.'"</p>

<p>Buffy helped her up. "Nothing broken?"</p>

<p>"Nope. How about you?"</p>

<p>"Fine. Just doing a 'Luke Skywalker meditation' deal. Only without that Obi-Wok guy. Or Soda." She smirked. "Whoa. I didn't realize it was so dark."</p>

<p>"Uh, Buffy?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>The slayer saw that the other girls had come along.</p>

<p>"I know their names, Will. I was joking."</p>

<p>"Oh. Good. I just wasn't sure, cause with IHOP this morning you didn't know..." She trailed off. "No danger?"</p>

<p>The shrieking began again.</p>

<p>"Stop bitching and face me!" Buffy yelled into the dark. She turned to her girlfriend. "So, how was your day?"</p>

<p>"Pretty okay. Except for the 'missing you' part. Hours and hours of waiting. I'm not good at that." Tara said, still sighing in relief that Buffy was okay.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Sorry I missed lunch. Experienced a case of 'getting lost.'" She leaned back into Tara, and she felt arms go around her waist. "But thanks for the rescue."</p>

<p>"Don't mention it."</p>

<p>"We had that problem." Amy chipped in. "Getting lost."</p>

<p>"But only for about a half hour." Willow added.</p>

<p>"Who's keeping track?" Amy coughed. "Forty-four minutes and thirty-eight seconds." She smiled. "Anyway, why don't we go? This thing, whatever it is, obviously doesn't like us, and I'm beginning to miss my comforter."</p>

<p>"I'm right here." The redhead pouted.</p>

<p>"The one on my bed."</p>

<p>"Oh." Amy's arms went around her neck.</p>

<p>"I'd love to, but I have to take this thing out. I can't let it run loose." Buffy said. "What if it attacks some other campers that come here after us?"</p>

<p>"Who cares about -?" Three sets of eyes stared at Amy. "Never mind. God, that was mean, wasn't it? Must be forest insanity setting in."</p>

<p>"We'll be outta here soon, we just need to find it first. Then kill it."</p>

<p>The witches' faces lit up.</p>

<p>"Spell!" They echoed.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy laughed. "Yeah, now tell me how you *really* feel." She stepped back a few paces. "If you don't mind, I think I'll sit this one out."</p>

<p>"But why?" Tara looked back at her.</p>

<p>"Spelling's not my gig, it's yours. I slay, you do spells."</p>

<p>"But...I slay. I slay pretty well thank you very much." Willow pouted. "Well, the times I'm not getting captured and hurt and stuff. And you can so spell. I've seen your sentences. High quality."</p>

<p>"Yeah, Buffy, come on." Amy added.</p>

<p>"Pleeeeeaaassssseeee?" Tara whined.</p>

<p>Buffy rolled her eyes. "Okay, but I don't know what I could..." She couldn't finish her sentence, because the three witches decided it was group hug time. Buffy laughed. "Okay, okay. You need me to do a spell, I need to breathe. I think we can make an even trade here, don't you?"</p>

<p>Willow and Amy backed away. "Sorry." They echoed.</p>

<p>"I'm not." Tara kissed her on the cheek. "Thank you. This means a lot to me."</p>

<p>"Yeah, well...consider it payback. For the vamp that shot me, and you dusted. Even though I could never pay you back for that, by the way, least I can do is try." Buffy leaned in for what was supposed to be a small peck, but it turned into a little more than they bargained for.</p>

<p>"Uh, guys?" Willow interrupted. "Spell, home, kissing. In that order, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"Sorry." Buffy smiled at her. "So. What's the wha--uh, I mean...what are we doing?"</p>

<p>'Great, not only am I thinking about Faith, I'm starting to talk like her.' She shook her head.</p>

<p>"You okay?" Tara asked.</p>

<p>"Hmm? Yeah, fine." She smiled. "So?" Willow frowned and Buffy caught it. "What?"</p>

<p>"You're doing it again, but we can talk about that back at camp. And believe me when I say we'll talk. Got it?" She shook her finger at Buffy and closed off any further discussion for later. "Now, what we need is a guiding spell, or, hmmm, maybe a light spell first, that way we won't trip over branches and stuff, or..."</p>

<p>"How about a simple tracking spell?" Amy knew that look in Willow's eye. If she let her go any further, they'd be trying different spells all night. "I know it's kinda tough to track something when you don't know what it looks like, but we can do a demon tracking spell."</p>

<p>"If we do a demon tracking spell, more than half the woods is going to light up." The three witches looked at Buffy quizzically. "Initiative caves. Remember?"</p>

<p>"Right. Initiative." Willow said, recalling. "I kinda blocked them out. Like a bad plotline from a TV show. Hey! That's it! The caves, we passed them right before we got here. If we can get back to them, then you can do the slayer thing and, you know, scout them out."</p>

<p>"Tinkerbell spell?" Tara asked.</p>

<p>Now Buffy was confused. There was another shriek, only this time it was closer, and followed by what sounded like demonic laughter.</p>

<p>Willow looked around. "Uh, that was really..."</p>

<p>"Creepy." Tara finished.</p>

<p>"Now it's mocking me!" Buffy's eyes narrowed as she looked at her surroundings. "Sure, mock me all you want, you...thing. Just wait until I get my hands on you, then we'll see who's doing a little demonic chuckle then."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'd say forest insanity has firmly set in." Amy looked at Willow. "Let's do a spell, quick, find it," She pointed to Buffy, "and slay it. And then we all go home for snuggles. What do ya say?"</p>

<p>"I'm in." Buffy nodded.</p>

<p>"Me too." Tara and Willow agreed.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The three of them sat around an impromptu campfire. There were various herbs sprinkled around them in a big circle and they all sat on the 'corners' of the circle in the lotus position.</p>

<p>Buffy looked over at Tara and whispered. "What do I do?"</p>

<p>"Just concentrate."</p>

<p>"Oh." She paused a moment then looked at her again. "On what?"</p>

<p>Tara smiled. "Your center. Everyone has a center, you know, the place where they're at peace? Concentrate on finding that and the rest will fall into place. Trust me."</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"We call upon the forces of nature." Willow began. "Wind at our backs, earth under our feet..."</p>

<p>"...water in the sky, fire here before us." Amy picked up the spell, and reached out for everyone to grasp hands. "Give us eyes to see the dark force at work in our midst. Show us the danger..."</p>

<p>"Lead us to the demon who wishes to cause harm." Tara took over.</p>

<p>Buffy heard the words, but didn't really hear them. All she could hear were the voices in her head. The voices of the past slayers.</p>

<p>'You know what you are.'</p>

<p>'You know who you are to become.'</p>

<p>'You can do it alone, but the road is smoother with peace in your life.'</p>

<p>'Find peace, sister. Slay your own demons, then the world's.'</p>

<p>'Easier said than done.' Buffy told them silently.</p>

<p>'We didn't say it would be easy.'</p>

<p>'Don't start getting sarcastic with -'</p>

<p>She couldn't hear anything now. Nothing. She felt herself rising, walking. Her vision was clearer; it was like she had a guide showing her where to go. Several guides, actually. Everything had a golden tint to it, and she knew her friends were following her.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"I was right." Willow said to Amy and Tara quietly as Buffy entered the cave. "It's in there."</p>

<p>"Um, how did she do that thing with her eyes?" Amy asked. "That wasn't part of the spell."</p>

<p>"The slayers must have used our spell to figure out where the demon was, and are helping Buffy get to it." Tara figured out.</p>

<p>"Slayers?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't you feel them?"</p>

<p>"Something felt different. I guess that was it." She shrugged.</p>

<p>"Wait, is it like the enjoining spell we did?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"Kind of." Tara nodded. "Except she's not drawing on us. Only on the energies of the passed slayers. She's strong enough to handle it now. She's got the ability to do magick, and when she tapped into you during the spell, your magick unlocked hers. And it's on a whole nother level from ours."</p>

<p>"Uh...neat." She bit her lip, shocked by the new information. "How do you know all this?"</p>

<p>"Long story. For later." She couldn't see her girlfriend anymore. "We should follow her. It's like a maze in there, and we might...lose her."</p>

<p>"How are we going to see?" Amy questioned. "We don't have eyes that act as flashlights."</p>

<p>"Tinkerbell?" The redhead looked hopeful.</p>

<p>"Okay, okay." Tara smiled.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy came to a stop. She was deep within the caves. The thing was making its home here, probably even before the Initiative came. Adam kept it at bay most likely. Power was coursing through her, magick, strength...power. The demon-beast was all around her, but it felt the power too, and was keeping its distance. No matter, she'd seek it out.</p>

<p>That's when everything got really bright. Buffy could see; the light she was using was just bright enough. But the extra luminescence clashed with hers, and she felt a sharp pain in her eyes. It was like somebody turned on a light after she'd been in the dark for hours. It broke off the flow of the other slayers' energies, and everything was normal again.</p>

<p>She nearly collapsed because of the abrupt end, and the beast blindsided her, taking advantage. She flew into the cave wall, and fell to the floor. The impact jarred loose a stalagmite above her, and it nearly entered her back, but she rolled out of the way in the nick of time. Getting up, she caught a glimpse of it before it vanished from her view.</p>

<p>Fast.</p>

<p>The three witches came running in.</p>

<p>"Get out of here!" She warned them.</p>

<p>But it was too late. It showed itself, going in between the girls and the slayer. It was on all fours, its supernatural muscles rippling under its hairless skin, which looked to be a muted red color. Its teeth were endless and very sharp looking. It had a snout like a bull, with two black horns rising out of his head. It had five fingers and toes, all in the shape of claws, and a long tail that was currently whipping around wildly.</p>

<p>"Say 'hello' to the stereotypical hellbeast." Buffy remarked. "What is this? The Devil's pet?"</p>

<p>"Just in case it is, maybe you shouldn't make fun of it." Willow said to her from the other side of the creature.</p>

<p>"But it's so unoriginal! If it breathes fire, I'm going to be very disappointed in the forces of darkness."</p>

<p>"Can you really kill something that comes directly from Hell?" Amy wondered.</p>

<p>"Only one way to -"</p>

<p>Before Buffy could finish, they felt the full force of its shriek. It appeared annoyed with the visitors. Its mouth opened wide, and a black tongue swirled around inside. Putting their hands over their ears, the girls watched as the cave walls shook, and dust rained down.</p>

<p>During the confusion, the creature used its tail to grab Tara off the ground, and bring her in front of its jaws.</p>

<p>"Tara!" Buffy yelled. She tried to run, but was having trouble keeping her footing.</p>

<p>The blonde witch felt as if she was being crushed. Both Buffy and Willow were making their way to the creature, but it swatted at them with both its arms, getting up on its hind legs to balance itself. The slayer and the redhead rolled back, their efforts for nothing. The creature then slammed its front end back down, making it feel like they were experiencing an earthquake.</p>

<p>Tara was surprisingly calm, as she spoke silent words to herself. She managed to yank her arm free, and when she did, she blew on her palm sending what looked like crystallized dust into her captor's face. It was enough of a distraction, because the beast released its grip, and she landed on the cave floor.</p>

<p>With a menacing growl, a green mist began to envelop everything. Buffy, trying to get to Tara by crawling on her hands and knees, lost sight of her. Then her eyes began to close.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Uh, my head." Buffy opened her eyes slowly to find that she was in the middle of the woods. She sat up, a bit too quickly. "Uh, my...everything." She picked some leaves out of her hair and looked around. She immediately spotted Willow. "Will?" She crawled over to the redhead. "Will, come on. This is no time for a nap."</p>

<p>"Buffy? What happened?" She sat up. "And did you get the number of that train that hit us?"</p>

<p>"You okay? No broken bones or anything?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, but...where's Amy? And Tara?"</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Tara. Get up. Come on."</p>

<p>"Wha...what happened?"</p>

<p>"Good question. I think that hell beast hit us with some really powerful mojo and knocked us out. Can you get up?"</p>

<p>Tara nodded and rose to her feet. She looked around. "We're still in the caves. But where's Buffy and Willow?"</p>

<p>"We must have gotten separated in the hail of magick." Amy stretched. "I'm sure they're around here somewhere."</p>

<p>Tara stood still and closed her eyes. After a few moments, she opened them and looked back at Amy. "I can't feel her." She whispered.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Buffy, this is insane. If they're looking for us, and we're moving, then they could have already been someplace we've already been to and missed us totally cause we're not where we're supposed to be."</p>

<p>The Slayer turned to her. "Uh, I pick C."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You know how you take those state tests every year and have to fill in the annoying little circles? Well, whenever I didn't understand the question, I'd always put down C."</p>

<p>"This is no time to be joking around, Buffy." The redhead pouted. "They could be anywhere. And so could we."</p>

<p>"I know, Will. I'm sorry. Just trying to lighten the mood. Let's just keep walking. We're bound to get outta here at one point. Either that or run into something vaguely familiar. It's not like Breakers Woods is as big as the Appalachians. Ya know?"</p>

<p>"Okay. I'll trust the Slayer instinct this time."</p>

<p>Willow walked silently beside her for awhile. It occurred to her that this was the first time they'd been alone in a long time. "So...how have you been?"</p>

<p>Buffy smirked at her. "Fine. And you? What's up, Will? We see each other every day. You know how I am."</p>

<p>"Not really, Buffy. I mean, we've both had new stuff in our lives and we haven't been alone much. At all even. At least since Amy and I got together."</p>

<p>The Slayer thought for a few moments then stopped in her tracks. "You know, you're right. We haven't spent any time alone. And we swore we wouldn't do that again. I'm a horrible friend. Yet again."</p>

<p>Willow chuckled. "I didn't say that to make you feel bad. It's just something I noticed, is all. No big. We have time to fix it."</p>

<p>"So. You and Amy..." Buffy stumbled over her words.</p>

<p>"It's great. The way she makes me feel...it's warm fuzzies all over. But I'm sure it's like that with you and Tara. She loves you so much."</p>

<p>"Tara's...I haven't met anyone like her before. I felt the same way when I met you. If I was as open minded then as I am now, maybe..."</p>

<p>"Awww, Buffy..." Willow blushed.</p>

<p>The slayer cleared her throat. "But you became my best friend, and I love that."</p>

<p>"Me too."</p>

<p>"She's just the best thing that could've happened to me. Tara. After that first kiss, I knew I loved her. It was immediate. And the only other person who ever made me feel that way was Angel. But it's different with her. Can't explain really."</p>

<p>"You don't have to. She's lucky she has someone as great as you. And vice versa. You know, it's funny how things happen. If it wasn't for Tara, I never would have thought about Amy in *that* way, but I'm glad we're...what we are. Super glad."</p>

<p>"And if it wasn't for you going off with your parents or her making dream appearances, I would never -" She stopped herself. "I mean -"</p>

<p>"She told me." Willow smiled in reassurance, and gave her friend a hug. "It's okay."</p>

<p>Buffy sighed in relief, and grinned. She didn't want to embarrass her friend, but this was exactly what best friends talked about. "Have you...I mean, did you, um...with Amy?"</p>

<p>Willow blushed again. "Uh, I mean, we um, that is to say I haven't really, you know technically...why are you asking me this?"</p>

<p>The slayer shrugged. "Just to keep the conversation moving, I guess."</p>

<p>"How about you?" Willow smirked when she saw Buffy pale. "Two can play that game, you know."</p>

<p>"Look." Buffy pointed ahead of them to the caves. "Looks like we found our way after all." She smiled at Willow and ran ahead.</p>

<p>"Buffy, wait...and that's not fair! You never answered my question!"</p>

<p>The beast charged out of the mouth.</p>

<p>"You could try asking him." Buffy suggested. "They say sex is the work of the Devil, right?"</p>

<p>"So is that a yes?"</p>

<p>"Bushes! Dive!" They did, and the creature missed them. "And no, it's not!"</p>

<p>"You haven't?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say that! I said it was a no to the yes!"</p>

<p>"But...now I'm scared *and* confused."</p>

<p>"That was the plan."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Amy and Tara were walking around the caves trying to find their way out. So far, they weren't having any luck. "These caves must go on forever. We're never gonna get out of here." Amy pouted and sat down on a nearby rock.</p>

<p>Tara sat down next to her. "We'll rest for awhile, then we can go that way. I don't think we've been there yet."</p>

<p>"You sure?" Amy shook her head. "They all look the same to me."</p>

<p>"I'm sure." Tara smiled at her. "We'll be fine."</p>

<p>Amy looked at her for a few moments and chose her next words carefully. "Tara, about you and Willow, I mean, when you guys were together...never mind."</p>

<p>"You can ask me. Anything."</p>

<p>"Well, I was wondering...how much, you know, really powerful magic you guys did. I mean, I know Will has really improved over these past two years, and I know that's in part cause of you."</p>

<p>"Willow's great, at spells and stuff. She really knows what she's doing when she focuses, but, she's not confident enough sometimes and that's mostly why her spells go into a downward spiral." Tara shrugged. "We never really did anything that big. We did contact the nether realms once, and that was...wow. Just, so powerful."</p>

<p>Amy nodded. "Yeah, I can imagine. I guess I'm asking because I don't want to scare her. You know? I've been practicing for a really long time and I tend to go the distance when trying something new. I just don't want to chase her off."</p>

<p>"Buffy and I talked about this one time. Willow and I, the spells we did, they tended to be small. Ya know? And the bigger they got, the more intense they got. We just couldn't seem to achieve a balance with them sometimes. She's a light practitioner and so am I, but with you, I think it may work out better all around. You're kind of like the ying to her yang."</p>

<p>"Yeah, I've noticed that. We just seem to...know how to get that balance. It wasn't like that before."</p>

<p>"Maybe you just weren't ready for each other."</p>

<p>Amy nodded. "Yeah. Maybe."</p>

<p>Both girls jumped when they heard the hell beast roar again. This time it came from right behind them. Or in front of them. They couldn't tell.</p>

<p>"You thinking what I'm thinking?" Amy turned to Tara.</p>

<p>"Run?"</p>

<p>Amy nodded. "Run!"</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Is there a reason you decided to get on its back?" Willow yelled up to her friend.</p>

<p>"I'm trying out for the rodeo." Buffy snapped, holding onto the horns as the creature bucked erratically. "I'm all up for ideas here!"</p>

<p>"First, I think..." The fading blonde was thrown into Willow. "You should get off."</p>

<p>"Sorry." They untangled themselves, breathing heavily. "What am I supposed to do? I'm weaponless."</p>

<p>"Debate the better type of brimstone to use for interior decorating in Hell?"</p>

<p>"You have too many thoughts."</p>

<p>"Why does everyone always say that?" She looked up at their attacker; it wasn't paying attention to them. "That's rude. Don't you think that's rude? We're here, playing the good, tired victims, and it gets bored."</p>

<p>Buffy pointed. A layer of ice was forming over its body. It was frozen in place. Amy and Tara jogged over.</p>

<p>"We kick ass." Amy said. "I'll never have to drink warm soda again."</p>

<p>"You're not dead!" Willow crushed her in a hug. She looked at Tara and Buffy. "Why not hugging?"</p>

<p>"Oh, probably cause the ice is melting off his super hot skin and we're royally screwed." Buffy looked at her girlfriend. "But I'm very relieved you're not hurt, don't get me wrong."</p>

<p>"Ditto." Tara said. "What are our options?"</p>

<p>"Spells. I don't know what could help, though."</p>

<p>"We could send it back to where it came from." Willow said.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Haven't thought that far ahead."</p>

<p>'Let us assist you. We need your friends. And we need the one who has gone astray.'</p>

<p>'Why her?'</p>

<p>'She's one of us. Her energy is essential, as is the mystical prowess of the witches.'</p>

<p>'Kind of impossible.' Buffy told the voices.</p>

<p>'Just say you will accept her help, and we'll do the rest. She wants to, but you don't have much time.'</p>

<p>Tara was staring at her, and she sighed, nodding. She was getting an odd look from her too. What Buffy didn't realize was that as she was "talking" to the spirits, her face was practically changing shape. Contorting, so with every new voice, she took on the visage of that person.</p>

<p>'Fine. Let's do it. I accept. And tell her I'm sorry.'</p>

<p>'You will tell her that yourself.'</p>

<p>'Getting pushy, aren't you?'</p>

<p>"Ready?" Buffy asked out loud.</p>

<p>"What for?" Amy inquired.</p>

<p>"You'll see. I hope."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy closed her eyes and took a few calming breaths. She knew what to do, and how to do it; the voices of the slayers took care of that.</p>

<p>"Slayers of the past, I plead for your assistance. Help me and my friends in our hour of need." Suddenly, she opened her eyes and threw back her head. "Help us help ourselves."</p>

<p>A bright light appeared out of nowhere. Buffy shielded her eyes from the brightness, but as quickly as it came, it went, and in its place, a beautiful amulet was floating in mid air.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"You'd think she'd lend a hand here!" Amy yelled after she threw another tree branch at the hell beast.</p>

<p>"She'll come through." Willow responded from behind a tree. She and Tara were levitating rocks at the beast in between Amy's swings at it. They were all a fair distance from it, and their attempts seemed to keep it at bay for now.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy walked up to the amulet, and it slowly floated down to her hand. She enclosed it in her palm and sighed deep.</p>

<p>'Trust us, Slayer.'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid. The power I feel...it's overwhelming.'</p>

<p>'Drink in the power. It is the strength of generations flowing through your veins, pumping blood into your heart. You know what you are, now use it.'</p>

<p>Buffy opened her eyes and immediately charged the beast. She jumped and planted both of her feet square in its broad chest. The beast flew back and crashed into the wall of the cave twenty feet back.</p>

<p>"That was, uh..." Amy was crouching behind a bush, beside Tara and Willow.</p>

<p>"Yeah." Willow looked at the slayer, amazed.</p>

<p>Buffy ran up to them. "You guys okay?" The three witches nodded. "Good. Now come on, let's finish this thing off." She ran towards the beast with the witches trailing behind. "Make a circle around the outside of it."</p>

<p>The four of them each got on a side of the creature, and Buffy held the amulet above her head. They began speaking words, but had no idea where they were coming from.</p>

<p>"Hetan, primal beast of the Underworld, before you is the Amulet of Limhas, the creation of the first watcher on Earth. He and his charge took it upon themselves to cast the remaining pure remnants of the Old World into their new prison, but you eliminated her and escaped confinement.</p>

<p>"Many of us have met the same fate. We were foolish and did not have the proper preparation. Thousands of years have passed however, and the Chosen One has. Along with the wiccans, united together by powerful bonds of love and friendship, they stand ready to finish it. Your time on this plane is now ended. Be gone!"</p>

<p>The amulet started to glow purple, and shake in Buffy's hand. She pulled her arm back, looked up at the sky, and threw it hard. A whirlwind formed in the late night, early morning sky, volatile and powerful. Leaves were blowing, trees were blowing, and there was fear in the beast's blood red eyes.</p>

<p>'Anchor yourself. Quickly!'</p>

<p>The girls had to grab onto to something, to keep the force from pulling them upwards. The frightened Hetan extended its tail in desperation, and hooked it around a tree trunk, the one Amy was holding onto. The roots were ripped right from the ground, and Amy found herself rising.</p>

<p>"Buffy! She's -" Willow yelled.</p>

<p>"Help!" Amy screamed.</p>

<p>Buffy scaled the tree she was using, and walked out to the end of the highest branch. Her foot slipped, and she felt Willow and Tara helping keep her there. She sat down with her legs on either side of the branch, and turned upside down, using her feet to anchor herself to the branch. She reached her arm out, and grabbed Amy's ankle, just before it was out of her reach.</p>

<p>"Don't let go!"</p>

<p>"I got you!"</p>

<p>They all watched the creature get sucked into the whirlwind, shrieking the entire time. After a minute, the vortex vanished, and the tree dwellers fell into the arms of their others. Well, more like they all collapsed into a big heap.</p>

<p>"Who wants marshmallows?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>She was answered with groans.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>By the time they got back to the campsite, day was breaking. The partners in the two couples were leaning on each other, and giving one another the motivation to keep moving. Buffy was examining the amulet, holding it in her hand. It had dropped from the sky a minute or two after she and Amy had dropped from the tree.</p>

<p>"What are you gonna do with that?" Tara asked her.</p>

<p>Buffy attempted a shrug. It caused pain. "Ow. Uh...maybe Giles can use a new paperweight."</p>

<p>"You think it's useless now?"</p>

<p>"Honestly, Tara? Beats the hell out of me." She started to giggle. "I really hate Hell. Though I am supposed to be a good guy, so I guess that works out pretty well."</p>

<p>"That was rough."</p>

<p>"Arguably the roughest thing we've ever faced." Willow said. "As a group, anyway."</p>

<p>"Couldn't have done it without ya." Buffy thanked them.</p>

<p>"Anytime." Amy said with a hiss. Something hurt. A lot of somethings. "Any time that's far from now."</p>

<p>They were tired, achy, disheveled, their hair was straggly with a leaf or two sticking to it, they had cuts and bruises, and their clothes were torn. But they were alive. And that was always a cause for celebration. Once the painful feelings left their bodies.</p>

<p>Tara gave her girlfriend a kiss. It was a wonderful distraction.</p>

<p>"That was nice." The next one was longer, and there was more exploring. "Even nicer."</p>

<p>"So glad it's over." Tara said, touching her lips.</p>

<p>"Almost." The slayer whispered.</p>

<p>"They *so* have, Wills." Amy said, getting a look of determination.</p>

<p>Willow almost fainted. She had this strong urge to want to be in the dorm, alone with Amy. She had never wanted that so badly before. But for now, they were about to follow their friends' example. However, Giles decided at that moment to come running up to them.</p>

<p>"Thank God I found you!" He was out of breath. "Anya, Xander and I were going through the possible books we could sell in the shop, and we came across a reference to an ancient beast that has inhabited these woods for quite some time."</p>

<p>"Huh. You don't say?" Buffy said nonchalantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, and it's from the depths of Hell itself. Very inhospitable to anyone or anything that enters its territory. Extremely protective."</p>

<p>"Really? So it's dangerous?" Amy asked.</p>

<p>"Absolutely. The sooner we leave the better. A creature as strong as it's described to be, won't be easily defeated."</p>

<p>"Good thing you didn't get here too late then. Who knows what coulda happened?" Willow was hiding the sarcasm from her voice surprisingly well.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Mr. Giles." Tara said. "I'm sure we'll be safe now."</p>

<p>"Really, it was no..." It was then that he got a good look at them. "Say, what happened to you?"</p>

<p>"Mean family of squirrels." The redhead told him. "They could've had rabies."</p>

<p>Buffy tossed him the amulet, and the four of them walked past him, wanting to get out of there as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>"What's this?" Giles questioned. "Buffy? Girls?"</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"What brings you here, girlfriend?"</p>

<p>It had been two weeks since the forest adventure, and it took all of those two weeks for Buffy to be able to build up her courage to come all this way, and do what she was currently doing. She stared at the person on the other side of the glass, and made sure she speaking directly into the provided telephone.</p>

<p>"The cheery atmosphere." The other girl grinned. "What else, Faith? You."</p>

<p>"Don't go makin' me feel special, B. That's out of character for ya." Faith hadn't lost her edge that was for sure. Buffy felt the sting, some of it she deserved. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Good question. No clue what the answer is, but good question."</p>

<p>The honesty and softness in Buffy's eyes caused Faith's expression to soften a little.</p>

<p>"I don't have all day. The guards are hardasses. So pick a starting point."</p>

<p>"You doing okay?"</p>

<p>"Considering I'm in jail...could be worse. Five by five for the most part."</p>

<p>"I'm glad." They were quiet for several moments, studying each other, wondering if the other was truly sincere. "It's your turn. Ask away."</p>

<p>"Angel know you're here?"</p>

<p>"Nope." Buffy hardly showed any reaction.</p>

<p>Faith nodded; there was something sad about that. They couldn't even talk anymore? But then she recalled something. It had been bugging her.</p>

<p>"Hey, something weird happen to you a couple weeks ago? Cause I remember feelin' wicked strange. I know the food around here doesn't have a good track record, but I don't think that was it."</p>

<p>"Actually," Buffy coughed, "funny story. Well, not funny 'ha ha'..."</p>

<p>They both smiled slightly, and the first step in the healing process for the two slayers, was now in full swing. Standing by the door, Tara smiled as well.</p>
