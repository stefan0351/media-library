<!-- Human Layers \ Part Four -->

<p>"We found this address, we checked it out with Xander, and it turned out
-" Angel was telling Buffy as she sat at her dining room table.</p>
<p>"And Xander?" She interrupted, almost finding it funny. "Wow.
Everybody's in. It's like a great big exciting conspiracy."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"I'm talking about the people I trust. Who's Druscilla?" The souled
vampire lowered his eyes. "And don't lie to me. I'm tired of it."</p>

<p>"Some lies are necessary."</p>
<p>"For what?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes the truth is worse. You live long enough, you find that
out."</p>
<p>"I can take it. I can take the truth."</p>
<p>"Do you love me?"</p>
<p>That blindsided her. Angel had never been that direct in the whole time she'd
known him. Yet as they talked now, she was starting to realize that she hadn't
ever *really* known him.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Do you?"</p>
<p>As she was contemplating the answer, one face surfaced in her mind.
Cordelia's. Betrayal wasn't the first word she thought of with her. No, Cordelia
had been brutally honest with her on a wide range of subjects. Unlike some
people. And there was still doubt. Lots of it.</p>

<p>"I don't know." She told him truthfully, which was more than he was
doing at the moment.</p>
<p>A brief look of hurt passed over Angel's eyes. "Maybe it should stay
that way."</p>
<p>"Maybe I'm the one who should decide!"</p>
<p>How did they get here? Everything had been fine. Halloween went by, taking
all the evil Chaos sorcerers and costumed insanity with it. There was only one
Chaos sorcerer according to Giles, but that was a technicality. Giles had been
unusually cryptic, though...whatever. She wasn't embellishing; that was what was
important. It had been insanity, and she had become one of her meek ancestors.
Anyhow, it gave way to a relatively calm week and a half, and breaks were always
good.</p>
<p>She had used it to go shopping with Cordelia, begging Willow to come along.
It took a few minutes of coaxing and promises of a barb-free couple of hours,
but she went. The redhead had been slightly uncomfortable, and no big leaps were
made, but there was progress. Cordelia had taken awhile to get used to the fact
that someone else was in on their secret, but the cheerleader did come to terms
with it, and even bought Willow a shirt as a sort of peace offering.</p>
<p>Whether or not it would be worn, was a different story.</p>
<p>While she was out on patrol the other night though, she had happened to see
Angel talking to a woman in the park. That woman was Druscilla, whom she now
knew was a vampire, as well as Spike's girlfriend. At the time it had only given
her the creeps, and she hadn't thought much of it until Giles told her what
Druscilla was. She asked herself why Angel would be hanging with the enemy, but
couldn't come up with an explanation that satisfied her.</p>

<p>Strike one.</p>
<p>Then when she asked him what he'd been doing when she saw him the following
night, he had lied to her. He said he'd been at home, reading.</p>
<p>Strike two.</p>
<p>On top of that, an old friend hers from Hemry had transferred to Sunnydale,
Billy Fordham. It was nice to see him. Memories of her previous life came
flooding back to haunt her, but it was nice to see him. Cordelia immediately
gave him the evil eye, and again, Buffy found her cute, quickly assuring
Cordelia that the agreement was still in effect, and that he wasn't a threat in
the romantic sense.</p>
<p>Angel however, had taken his jealousy to the extreme. He had shown up at the
back door just minutes ago, they had come in here, and then he began telling her
that he'd had Willow search Ford's personal records. Also, they'd gone to an
address with Xander that somehow proved Ford was evil. Angel was being a tad
over-protective, and shakily walking the 'obsessive' line. Buffy didn't know
whether to call that strike three or not, because he could be right, but it was
the principle of the thing.</p>
<p>"I did a lot of unconscionable things when I became a vampire." He
turned away from her. "Druscilla was the worst. She was...an obsession of
mine. She was pure and sweet and chaste..."</p>
<p>"And you made her a vampire." She figured she might as well fill in
the blank.</p>

<p>"First I made her insane." He turned back to look at her.
"Killed everybody she loved. Visited every mental torture on her I could devise." Buffy looked
down. "She eventually fled to a convent, and on the day she took her holy
orders, I turned her into a demon."</p>
<p>She stared him in the eye, trying to see the monster that could do that. But
he was different now. Wasn't he? She kept picturing people getting slaughtered,
a girl slowly crumbling away...all made possible by Angel. Or his demon.
Whatever. She couldn't. There was that danger she'd been so scared of, and it
existed within him. She felt sick, and as much as she knew he had a soul,
hearing that straight from his mouth, in that instant, she couldn't do it.</p>
<p>Strike three. For romance, anyway.</p>
<p>"Well...I asked for the truth."</p>
<p>He was out; she could tell that he knew. It didn't have to be said.</p>

<p>"Ford's part of some society that reveres vampires. Practically worships
them. I don't know what he wants from you, but you can't trust him."</p>
<p>It hurt him, and she was sorry for that, but at least now she was sure of
something. They wouldn't have to wonder or tiptoe around that issue anymore,
waiting for the other to bring it up. And it was better this way; they both knew
that. Could they be friends? Time would tell, she guessed. What she had left to
do now was, figure out what Cordelia meant to her, after she dealt with her old
friend.</p>
<p>She didn't know it then, but Ford wanted to live forever. Except it didn't
work that way. All he'd do was die, and she'd be forced to kill the monster
wearing his face. Why couldn't things ever be simple?</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
<p>Cordelia was lounging on the plush sofa in her house, watching some movie on
the big screen TV. She wasn't really focused on it, wasn't really focused on
anything. Every time she came home from school lately, she'd look around at
everything she had, and it was losing meaning to her; it never had any. She had
outfits and jewelry that she hadn't touched in a year because the style had
passed, or she had gotten a ring that had more carets than the last one. She saw
objects as dollar signs that held no attachment for her.</p>
<p>She had what most people in her parents income bracket, would call junk.
Expensive junk, but junk nonetheless. Any other person would thank their lucky
stars to have what she did, and it was inevitable that she would question her
life as she thought about that. People would love to be in her shoes, and she
never appreciated it. She couldn't.</p>
<p>It felt false anymore; all of it fading away and losing color. She still
cared about what she wore, but didn't care at the same time. It was weird. Like
she was a robot who was just following a pre-programmed set of instructions. She
had a certain amount of cash in her bank account? Okay, then she had to act this
way or buy that. She wasn't enjoying herself, and it was hollow, but she was
still trying to latch onto popularity, to everything she was used to. It was
like an addiction, and as she should've anticipated, slowly but surely, it had
already begun slipping away.</p>
<p>She was spending more and more time with Buffy in school, a public place. She
was having conversations with her openly, sometimes even with Willow. She was
breaking the rules where everyone could see, but while she was actively doing
it, Cordelia didn't notice. Buffy had that effect on her. It was only when she
was alone, like she was now, that she could fully reflect on what she'd done,
and just how many rungs on the ladder she'd fallen. It was getting worse every
day. Her group was starting to listen to Harmony. Her sway was lessening.</p>
<p>When she, Buffy and Willow had gone shopping, she had intelligently decided
to drive them to an upscale place in LA, where she didn't think anyone in 'the
circle' would go. Most of the girls', 'I'm wealthy, accept me' attitudes were
just for show, anyway; she kept them around mainly to brag about herself. They
weren't as well off as they acted, so Cordelia didn't think they'd be able to
afford anything where she'd gone. Plus, she was the only person among them who
had a car.</p>

<p>Well, that wasn't true any longer. Harmony had recently gotten one; the girl
could now go anywhere she wanted. It was pathetic. Harmony was complaining about
how pitiful Sunnydale's mall was, when only a few months ago, she spent all of
her free time there if she couldn't get Cordelia to drive somewhere else.</p>
<p>No one had said anything yet, but it was only a matter of time. They saw her
without guys; each one she looked at, someone who would worship her and wait on
her hand and foot, she saw Buffy's face instead. And besides the fact that there
was an agreement, they simply paled in comparison. She was turning down makeover
opportunities, and she was hanging out with the social enemy. A part of her
disliked Buffy for pulling her away from that world. It was shallow, and she was
smart enough to know that, but it held status. Then again, she couldn't blame
the slayer. Buffy didn't make her care about her.</p>
<p>Though the more time they spent together, the more Cordelia's eyes opened,
and the majority of her brain was telling her to not like 'the circle,' to not
care about what she owned. She should go deeper, find the actual person beneath
it all, and see what was waiting. Who she truly was came out around Buffy and
the others; she should explore that, and give her 'junk' to the Good Will.</p>
<p>The now minority was saying the opposite, of course. She should hang on for
dear life, to her possessions and her followers. If she took Buffy's path, she'd
just go into the unknown and never come out. It wasn't safe, and there was no
guarantee it would be worth it. What if Buffy decided to dump her? Then she'd be
stuck. She had to get back in before it was too late.</p>
<p>Someone was knocking at the door. Cordelia had sent the maid home once her
parents left for another party; they could take a cab as far as she was
concerned. She got up to go see who it was.</p>
<p>"Hi." Buffy greeted her when she opened the door.</p>
<p>Buffy at her house? It appeared that another rule was about to be broken.</p>
<p>"Hey." Cordelia responded. The slayer looked tense. "What's
wrong?"</p>

<p>"Funny you should ask. There're some unstoppable assassins after me, and
I think they might know where I live. Can I stay here tonight?"</p>
<p>"Assassins? Why would anyone want to -? Oh right."</p>
<p>"Yeah, the Order of Tarragon. Giles said I should be wigged, so I
am." Buffy stood there, waiting. She had felt like she was being watched
all day, but even more so on her way over here. "I'm not welcome?" She
frowned.</p>
<p>"Duh." The brunette sighed, smacking her forehead. "Of course
you are." Buffy smiled gratefully, and then walked in, shutting the door
behind her. "Damn! I should've made sure you weren't a vampire!"</p>

<p>Buffy laughed. "Here." She took Cordelia's hand and placed it over
her heart. Cordelia could feel it beating, but that wasn't all she could feel.
"Satisfied?"</p>
<p>"Uh...uh huh." The cheerleader said, quieter than she had intended.</p>
<p>Seconds passed until Buffy finally cleared her throat, and Cordelia,
none-too-suavely removed her hand from the slayer's chest.</p>
<p>"I don't think they'll come here, but...I don't want you to get hurt,
either...you know, it's probably safer if I just go to Angel's."</p>
<p>"Angel's?" Cordelia got in front of the door. "No, no, no, no,
no! It's fine. I accept the risks, I promise. And besides, you don't wanna
bother him...he's probably busy doing things...good vampire things. Like
reorganizing his blood packets or...eww! I just totally grossed myself
out." She took a breath. "Stay."</p>

<i>
<p>'Real smooth.'</p>
</i>
<p>This was what Buffy did to her. All her thoughts, everything that plagued her
vanished, and she turned into a rambling, insane woman who desperately wanted
Buffy to remain in her sight at all times. Life was simpler when Buffy was
around, yet complicated. Especially when there was physical contact involved.
And the slayer had a huge smile on her face. Cordelia knew she liked making her
incoherent, but she liked seeing that smile, so it was even.</p>
<p>"I don't love him."</p>
<p>Cordelia stood silent, absorbing the news. Then she formed a small smile of
her own.</p>
<p>"You don't?"</p>
<p>"Nope." It was another one of those moments again, and like the
last one, they let it pass. Buffy didn't want to do anything that'd make them
both uncomfortable, thus causing them to regret this whole thing, and Cordelia
was grateful for that. "Geez. Look at this place."</p>

<p>"My father always says you can't have too much luxury. Then again, he
says the same thing about alcohol." Cordelia smirked. "So let's get
this 'Waiting for Monsters to Come Kill Us' slumber party started. Want
anything?"</p>
<p>"I actually am a little hungry. Do you maybe have Doritos? Or a similar,
non-name-brand type product? I just need something to shut my stomach up."</p>
<p>"Lemme check." Cordelia led her into the living room. "Make
yourself at home. TV, couch...feel free."</p>
<p>Buffy headed straight for the sofa; it was practically calling out to her.
But her host went to the kitchen. "I appreciate this."</p>
<p>"It's no problem." Cordelia said, searching the cupboards.

"How's Giles?"</p>
<p>"Still marching with the guilt parade. His past came back to get him and
Miss Calendar got caught in the middle. It's eating at him, and it's not helping
that she pretends he doesn't exist whenever they see each other in the
hall."</p>
<p>"Can you blame her? She was possessed by a demon he helped make."</p>
<p>"I know, but he's my watcher, so I kinda have to join his camp. I want
to hit Ethan so bad. First it was Halloween..." Buffy yawned, and then she
drifted.</p>
<p>Cordelia was gone only a few minutes, but when she came back in, her guest
was fast asleep. "She must've been exhausted."</p>
<p>The sight of Buffy sleeping made Cordelia's breath catch in her throat. There
were no worry lines, signs of stress or pain, strength or weakness...the layers
had been stripped away. It was pure, simple. There was nothing artificial
covering her face. No makeup, nothing to hide imperfections. And she didn't need
it. This was Buffy. No other words of description were necessary, and she was
blown away.</p>
<p>Taking the blanket off the top of the sofa and laying it overtop of Buffy,
she didn't even remember the meaning of the word 'popularity.' How could she not
love this girl? It was easy to ask that now, and the answer was just as easy,
but as soon as she began to go upstairs, she knew all her fears would come back.
Though she wouldn't forget that she had gotten to see the toughest, most
selfless person she knew, in her most unguarded state.</p>

<p>And to Cordelia, that was pretty special.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
<p>A ringing telephone cut short the cheerleader's beauty sleep in the morning.</p>
<p>"Hello?" God. This was the last thing she needed. "No, I'm not
driving you to her house, Xander...Um, cause she's not missing? Moron...Why do I
know that?"</p>
<p>Oh no. Why did she know that?</p>
<i>
<p>'To hell with it. It's too early to come up with an excuse.'</p>
</i>

<p>"Cause she's downstairs sleeping...Yes, here...It's not a difficult
concept...No, it's not...I don't know why. Ask her...I don't have to prove
it...I have her severed head in a jar? You're majorly disturbed, you know that?
Don't you have to go burn ants with a magnifying glass or something?...Yeah,
that was *real* witty. Bravo..."</p>
<p>Becoming more awake by the second, Cordelia could hear banging downstairs.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" Buffy's voice was asking someone.</p>
<p>She cringed. She hoped it wasn't the maid.</p>
<p>"I have to go...Shut up...She'll call, okay?...Bye."</p>
<p>Rushing to the foyer, she saw that it definitely wasn't the maid. Buffy was
facing off with...was she Caribbean? Cordelia couldn't tell, but it was a girl,
and they were in almost identical fighting stances.</p>
<p>"I'm Kendra, da Vampire Slayer." The girl answered Buffy's question
with a thick accent.</p>

<p>"What?" Cordelia and Buffy echoed.</p>
<p>"Time." The brunette said, her hands forming a 'T.' "Instant
replay, please."</p>
<p>"Heard noise outside. Caught her snooping. We fought. At a
stalemate." Buffy told her side of the story.</p>
<p>Cordelia looked at Kendra, who cautiously let her guard down.</p>
<p>"I was sent 'ere by me watcher. He told me dat I would find a man by dee
name of Rupert Giles at a high school. De watcher in dis area. I began heading
dere last night, when I saw you." Kendra looked at Buffy. "I sensed
dat you were strong, but I was not sure if you were a vampire or not. I followed
you, and watched as you were invited into dis place. I eventually came to dee
conclusion dat you were not a demon."</p>

<p>"Eventually? What took you so long?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"You were staring at her neck a lot." Cordelia raised her eyebrows.
She hadn't picked up on this. "It is none of my business."</p>
<p>"Damn right it isn't." The blonde slayer said angrily, trying to
hide her blush. "Well, if you 'came to dat conclusion,' why were you
continuing to lurk?"</p>
<p>Mocking helped.</p>
<p>"I wasn't. I came back 'ere only a few minutes ago, waiting for you to
awaken. You are a slayer as well, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Last time I checked."</p>
<p>"I was going to introduce meself, but I was attacked."</p>
<p>Buffy looked guilty then, and relaxed. "I've been edgy, and I thought
you were one of the bad guys. Sorry."</p>
<p>"She has assassins after her." Cordelia explained.</p>
<p>"Assassins?" Kendra questioned.</p>
<p>"Why don't we take her to Giles? Then we can play Twenty Questions for a
Slayer like civilized people, and stop Xander from being a bigger idiot than he
already is." Cordelia suggested. "*After* you clean up the mess your
little Pay-Per-View match created, before my parents come stumbling home. Cause
I'm sure as hell not gonna."</p>

<p>Both slayers looked ashamed.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
<p>Buffy sat in the school lounge, numb. She'd killed a man. Knocked him down
the stairs. Sure, he hit her and was dating her mother, but that didn't justify
a killing. Certainly not the killing of a human being. She didn't want to have
to deal with this. She felt horrible, and there was nothing she could do to make
it better. She noticed all the stares and accusing eyes. She could tell the
police wanted to lock her up, and she didn't blame them.</p>
<p>And this was happening way too fast. She didn't even have time to bounce back
from the 'Assassins Giving Spike Time to Use Angel to Cure Druscilla' ordeal.
Talking more with Kendra in the library, she had found out that in the few hours
in which the other slayer hadn't been spying on her, she had come across Willy's
bar. Angel had gone there to get some information, they fought, and Kendra
almost got him killed. She locked him up in a cage in the storage room of the
bar, where the sun could easily shine in.</p>
<p>Before she had any reason to go to Cordelia's, Buffy had gone to her house
like normal, where this guy with a sliced eye and long hair was waiting to
fulfill his contract. Angel just happened to be in the area, and they finished
him off together. He snatched a ring off the guy's finger, and recognized it as
belonging to the Order of Taraka. He was obviously having trouble letting go,
but Buffy figured that since he had just saved her life, she wouldn't say
anything. Telling Angel she'd be okay, he reluctantly left to unknowingly go
meet Kendra.</p>
<p>She went inside and called Giles, and after he'd repeatedly told her how
dangerous the people were, she went to see her favorite cheerleader.</p>
<p>Willy had sold out Angel to Spike in the morning, and it took some convincing
to get Kendra to help her save him. Just because she didn't love him didn't mean
he deserved to die. While the arguing was going on, Xander was at her house. He
hadn't believed Cordelia, so he hurried over there as quickly as his legs would
take him, only to meet Assassin Number Two - The Bug Guy. He was able to escape
to the library fortunately, where Cordelia promptly said, "Told you
so."</p>
<p>When it came down to it, the assassins taken care of and Angel dying, Kendra
was by her side, and they rescued him. Not only were Spike and Druscilla now
history, as the church they had used went up in flames and an organ crashed down
around them, but she had also made a new friend. Yet it wasn't as if what she'd
accomplished mattered much anymore, because here she sat, a murderer.</p>

<p>"Buffy!" Xander said as he and Willow came to join her. "Are
you okay?"</p>
<p>"How come you're here?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"I couldn't stay at home. Mom won't even look at me." She said
sadly.</p>
<p>"What happened? Unless you don't wanna talk about it."</p>
<p>"We had a fight and I lost my temper. I really let him have it."</p>

<p>"The paper said he fell."</p>
<p>"He fell." Buffy agreed. "Hard."</p>
<p>"What was he?" Xander wondered.</p>
<p>"What?" Her brain wasn't functioning well.</p>
<p>"What was he? A-a demon? A giant bug? Some kind of dark god with the
secrets of nouvelle cuisine? I mean, we are talking creature-feature here,
right?" She just lowered her eyes. "Oh man."</p>

<p>"But I'm sure it wasn't your fault." Willow defended her. "He
started it."</p>
<p>"Yeah. That defense only works in six-year-old court, Will." Buffy
explained.</p>
<p>"Court? Wa-wait. Are they charging you with something?" Xander
asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head. "I-I don't know. Not yet." She paused. "He
was a person, and I killed him."</p>

<p>"Don't say that!" Willow exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Why not? Everyone else is. And it's the truth."</p>
<p>"It was an accident." Xander said, sympathetically.</p>
<p>"I'm the Slayer. I had no right to hit him like that."</p>
<p>"Look, Buffy, I don't know what happened exactly. But I do know you. And
I know you would never hurt anyone intentionally. Well, you know,
unless..."</p>
<p>"Unless they were dating my mother?" The three of them then turned
as Cordelia and her flock entered the lounge. The brunette locked eyes with the
slayer, and in full view of everyone, she walked over and hugged her. "I
gotta go."</p>

<p>"It'll be okay." Cordelia whispered.</p>
<p>Buffy got up and left, while Xander looked at Willow. "What's goin'
on?"</p>
<p>That's what the flock wanted to know.</p>
