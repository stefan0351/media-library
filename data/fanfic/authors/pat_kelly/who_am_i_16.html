<!-- Who Am I? \ Gearing Up (Or - 7-3-0) -->

<p>Faith and silence didn't mix. She usually hated it because, one, she wanted
to speak and
she wouldn't be allowed to; or two, it led to nervous fidgeting. In her
current situation,
it was the latter. She didn't know if it was obvious, but she knew she was
doing it, and
that was bad enough. This was make or break. Alienating Buffy's mother
would not be a good
idea. Not for her.</p>
<p>Of all the relationships she had rebuilt when she came back to Sunnydale,
she was still on
shaky ground with Joyce. The thing with Xander wasn't something she could
help, and it
really wasn't her fault. She didn't think she was doing anything horrible
by being with
Buffy either, but Joyce was a parent. A mother. A part of Faith desperately
wanted that
"motherly" connection she had never had. Joyce was her only hope.</p>
<p>Joyce had all the reasons in the world to be wary even after the two of
them had formed a
mutual understanding. She was looking out for her daughter's welfare, while
trying to
rationalize the relationship for herself and figure out if she could be
supportive. Some
people would be annoyed at that, maybe even push the person away, but Faith
liked it.
Joyce didn't pretend to know everything or be perfect. And she didn't flip
out.</p>
<p>Which was a change for Faith, whose mother was so drunk most of the time,
that she
convinced herself and Faith, that she knew everything. Even that Faith was
a little whore
who wouldn't amount to anything. The perfect mother. She always wondered
what her mother
was like sober, but the woman was usually passed out for most of the
day.</p>
<p>That wasn't Joyce. And that was good, because Buffy didn't deserve that
hell. Buffy must
have noticed her uneasiness, because she put her hand on Faith's knee.
Faith was grateful,
because somehow that simple gesture had calmed her nerves. And Joyce must
have noticed
too, because she had decided to speak.</p>
<p>"First, Angel told me to tell you that…Adam…is in a cave somewhere in
Breakers Woods…and
you would know what that meant."</p>
<p>After the slayers had filed away that tidbit of information, Buffy let her
surprise show.
"You went to see Angel?"</p>
<p>Joyce gave her a, "that's not the issue" look, and continued. "I've been
thinking a lot
about this, and I've tried to be rational, and not yell, or overreact. And
I'm not going
to do that now."</p>
<p>"But?" Buffy prodded.</p>
<p>Faith looked at Buffy. "There's a 'but'?"</p>
<p>"There's always a 'but'."</p>
<p>"I realize that you both are seeing each other, but I can't accept it. I've
tried to think
of a way to be supportive, but I just can't."</p>
<p>"Why not?" Buffy asked, shocked.</p>
<p>"I…just…it doesn't seem right. I think you're getting yourselves into a
situation that has
more consequences then you realize. But, I can't stop you. It's your
lives."</p>
<p>Faith felt like she had been punched in the gut. Buffy felt sick.</p>
<p>"If you talked to Angel then -"</p>
<p>"He may have centuries of wisdom, but I don't. We all know what happened
when he put his
love philosophy to the test. It didn't go really well."&nbsp; Buffy gave
her mom and icy stare.
"Maybe I'm being close-minded, but that's how I feel. I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"Look mom, maybe if we explained -"</p>
<p>"Buffy, you could explain it to me all you wanted, but I still wouldn't be
comfortable
with it. Maybe it's because I got hit with a lot at once, or maybe after a
little time -"</p>
<p>"It's me, isn't it?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>"No, it's not you. It's that you're both -"</p>
<p>Faith got off the sofa. "What do I have to do to show you that I'm not
gonna screw up
again?"</p>
<p>"I was trying to say that it's because you're both girls. You think it'd be
easier for me
to take considering some of the other things I know. It isn't. You two
don't have a choice
with slaying, but she has a choice…you have a choice, with this. People
will say -"</p>
<p>"I've heard enough cover stories to know that's bullshit. If it was Willow,
I bet you
wouldn't be this wound up." Faith raised her voice quite a few
notches.</p>
<p>"You don't know that."</p>
<p>"Red's the only one who hasn't gone psychotic, right? She'd be a hell of a
lot easier to
accept. You could at least give me a break and be honest."</p>
<p>"It's not all you." Faith flinched. "But you threatened my life and killed
others. Forgive
me if I have a problem with you being in a more, intimate, relationship
with my daughter,
where she's just a little more vulnerable."</p>
<p>"Can we please remember that I'm still here?" Buffy asked.</p>
<p>"I guess that's it then." Faith said, her argument deflated.</p>
<p>Behind the rage, Buffy could see the look Faith was giving her mother.
There was pleading,
there was hurt, and the emotions rushed to the surface, and a memory
emerged. It was
Faith's.</p>
<p align=center>~~~~~</p>
<p>"You don't know the first thing about Buffy.&nbsp; Or me." Joyce had
said.</p>
<p>I don't know what else to do. I don't know what I'm doing. I wanted her by
my side, but I
screwed up. You liked me. And now I'm screwing us up too.</p>
<p>"Don't I?&nbsp; I know what it's like.&nbsp; You think you matter.&nbsp;
You think you're a part of
something and you get dumped. It's like the whole world is moving but
you're stuck.&nbsp; Like
those animals in the tar pits.&nbsp; It's like you just keep sinking a
little deeper everyday
and nobody even sees."</p>
<p>You know what I'm talking about. We're both lonely. Both left out. You're
supposed to
understand. Please. Help me. Before I go too far.</p>
<p>Were you planning to slit my throat anytime soon?</p>
<p>I'm not really gonna kill ya. I'm just trying to get Buffy to come. It's
not the right way
to go about it, but I know she'll come for you. Maybe for me too. You're
her mother. I
never had that. But maybe I can. Can't you see? I can't look that
crazy.</p>
<p>"Don't tell me you don't see it, Joyce.&nbsp; You served your
purpose.&nbsp; You squirted out the
kid, raised her up, and now you might as well be dead!&nbsp; I mean nobody
cares!&nbsp; Nobody
remembers!&nbsp; Especially not Buffy-fabulous-super-hero!&nbsp; Sooner or
later you're gonna have
to face it.&nbsp; She was over us a long time ago, Joyce. Too busy climbing
onto her new boytoy
to give a single thought to the people that matter!&nbsp; I mean, you're
her mother and she
just leaves you here to die!"</p>
<p>She does remember you. It's me she doesn't remember. Why am I trying to
hurt you? Come on
Faith, you're not gonna use the knife. Why am I moving towards her? God,
I'm sorry. Stop
me. Mom.</p>
<p align=center>~~~~~</p>
<p>"You were my last -" Faith started to say then cut herself off.</p>
<p>Buffy shook her head as she came back to reality. Wow. Her mom's consent
was…she had never
realized how much Faith had...looked up to her. And now the brown-haired
slayer was
flinging open the door, and storming out.</p>
<p>Joyce looked stunned a second, and turned to her daughter.</p>
<p>"How can you even think of," Joyce forced out the word, "loving somebody
that unstable?
She could snap -"</p>
<p>"You really don't understand, do you? The least you could've done was made
an attempt. But
you had to shut us out. Without even trying to see our side. Would that've
been so hard?"
She got up and started to move to go after Faith.</p>
<p>"Buffy -"</p>
<p>Buffy shook her head. "Don't. Okay? Why do you always have to drive the
people I love
away?" Joyce paled. "Yeah, he told me. He said it was purely his decision."
She looked at
her mom, who was now looking at her hands. "Nice talk, by the way." Buffy
jogged up the
stairs, and outside looking around for Faith.</p>
<p>"Faith!"</p>
<p>The other girl was standing to the side of the door, up against the wall.
"Damn it!"</p>
<p>Buffy saw her. Saw her defensive position, and automatically knew she
couldn't let it
continue. She reached her arms out, and Faith voluntarily leaned into the
offered embrace.</p>
<p>"I know." Buffy said softly.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Riley felt like he was re-learning everything. Sky equaled blue. Grass
equaled green. He
saw Adam and Spike. They equaled trouble. Buffy. All he knew was that she
wasn't dead. And
that meant he had to get to her. He looked deeper into the large, dark
cave. There were
bodies. Lots of bodies. Demons. All alive. Almost…in stasis. What was Adam
planning to do
with them all?</p>
<p>"Ah, you're wondering about my experiments." Adam observed.</p>
<p>'He thinks you're on his side. You can use this. Stay calm.' Riley thought
to himself.</p>
<p>"How many are there?"</p>
<p>"One hundred and three. I wanted more, but they've all found places to
hide. Soon you and
I will lead them to our birthplace and free the captives. I suppose you'll
want revenge."</p>
<p>"Revenge?"</p>
<p>"What do you remember?"</p>
<p>"Being shot…waking up…attacking Faith and Buffy…killing men…" Riley
swallowed. "Killing
men with a skewer."</p>
<p>"You died. Your heart no longer beats."</p>
<p>"Then what…?"</p>
<p>"Advanced artificial neurons and machines designed to stimulate heart send
impulses
through wires to your memory banks. You still contain bio-materials, but
besides the few
brain cells that feed memory to your central hardware and help coordinate
movement with
it, the rest are non-functioning."</p>
<p>Riley looked down at his hands, and then brought them up to touch his face.
They felt
normal, but could he really feel anymore? Spike was watching the scene with
minimal
interest, but he did know Adam had made a mistake by "waking" Riley. But
was he going to
tell him?</p>
<p>Nah.</p>
<p>"I think I'm…going to take a walk." Riley said.</p>
<p>"Be cautious. Will you return here at nightfall?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. Sure. Nightfall."</p>
<p>Riley walked slowly out of the cave.</p>
<p>"What happens then?" Spike asked Adam.</p>
<p>"You're right. It's time to launch an offensive. The first wave of attack
will be against
the slayers. They need to be distracted from what I want to accomplish.
Will you lead?"</p>
<p>"Do you want them whole or in pieces?" Spike asked with a grin.</p>
<p>"It's time to wake the experiments."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Xander paced quietly outside, debating how to go in. He was wearing a
headset, so he had
to go in soon or else whoever was watching him would start to get
suspicious. It wasn't
that he didn't think he could get the disk, he was armed after all, but it
was the actual
process of taking it that worried him. All the scenarios he was playing out
in his head
were not good. He would either be in pain at one point, or causing pain.
There was no good
at all, but he figured he should just get it over with.</p>
<p>"I'm engaging." He said, speaking into the microphone.</p>
<p>Xander began moving towards the door.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>He turned around quickly to see Anya looking at him. "What are you doing
here?"</p>
<p>"I had nothing better to do. Are you going to answer me?"</p>
<p>"You have to get out of here."</p>
<p>She looked at the gun. "You're not going to shoot anybody."</p>
<p>"Anya." He tried to be forceful, but it sounded more like
pleading.</p>
<p>"I don't know exactly what you've gotten yourself into, but you're too good
to go bad."</p>
<p>"Go. Now."</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>They were watching and listening. He had to do something. Anya wasn't
helping matters. He
thought for a second, and saw a window of opportunity. Which he'd probably
pay for later,
but what choice did he have?</p>
<p>Walking up to her, he quickly reached out, wrapped his arm around her neck,
and turned her
around so he was behind her. "Move."</p>
<p>"Hey!" He lifted his gun arm up, and pointed the barrel at her side. "Okay,
okay."</p>
<p>They moved to the front door. "Open it."</p>
<p>"You really don't want to do this, Xander."</p>
<p>"The door."</p>
<p>She reached her arm out and turned the knob, pushing the door open. They
walked in slowly,
and everyone inside had heard the door open, so their eyes were watching
every move.</p>
<p>"Xander, what could you possibly be thinking?" Giles asked, being the first
to speak.</p>
<p>"Just give me the virus and…and…nobody gets hurt." Xander stuttered. He
wasn't good at the
hostage-gunman thing.</p>
<p>"You can't want to do this." Wesley said cautiously.</p>
<p>Willow and Tara had been standing side by side when Willow started to
approach Xander.
"Whatever you've been doing, just put the gun down and we'll talk about it,
okay? This is
me, remember? You don't want to shoot me do you?"</p>
<p>Xander silently cursed. He couldn't keep this up. She was going to blow it.
"Will, just
give it to me." He tightened his trigger finger. "I don't want to, but I
will if I have
to."</p>
<p>Anya simply sighed. "Okay, I've had enough."</p>
<p>She stomped down on his foot, and he removed his arms from around her neck,
and went to
reach down for his now in pain foot. She brought her arms up as he was
leaning over, and
slammed her elbows into his back. He dropped his gun, and the rest of him
went down with
it. While he was still on all fours, she kneed him in the face, and he fell
the rest of
the way, lapsing into unconsciousness.</p>
<p>She bent down over him. "I told you didn't want to do it. Love
hurts."</p>
<p>Everyone was in a stunned silence as Giles walked forward and retrieved the
gun. He looked
at it for a second, and then at Anya. "The safety was on."</p>
<p>Anya looked back at him. "I know."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Back inside the Initiative, all they were watching at the moment was
static. Xander's
headset had been busted. Graham had to feel sorry for him, but it was also
pretty pitiful.
The girl wasn't even a slayer.</p>
<p>"He's of no use anymore." The scientist said. "His effort failed. Didn't
seem like his
heart was in it, anyhow."</p>
<p>"We can retrieve him."</p>
<p>"Too risky." The man thought. "On the other hand, he has had prolonged
exposure to our
operation."</p>
<p>"You want to kill him? But all he knows is that we don't know
anything."</p>
<p>"You'd prefer letting him tell the slayers that they have the advantage
over us? Are you
feeling all right, sir? Your …attitude seems a little off."</p>
<p>"Fine." Graham straightened. "It's just my belief that you don't target a
fellow soldier."</p>
<p>"That's fine for the mainstream, but we work outside of it. Measures have
to be taken to
insure the survival of the project."</p>
<p>"It's all about funding and data with you people, isn't it? Whatever
happens trying to get
the right formula or technology doesn't matter, as long as it doesn't halt
progress."</p>
<p>"I just follow orders. Sir. If you wish to not take action against Harris,
there's nothing
I can do. But of all the black op organizations the government is…funding,
this is of the
highest priority. It would upset a number of important people if this
facility and its
research were to be compromised."</p>
<p>Graham closed his eyes. This was getting worse and worse. Too many
mistakes. Too many
bureaucratic decisions. He'd fix things soon enough. "I'll lead a team
myself. Tonight. We
may even take the slayers too."</p>
<p>"Excellent decision, sir. Very wise."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Faith had just started walking. Buffy had no idea where she was going, but
followed her
anyway. They left the apartment, and cut through Restfield and Shady Hill
before she
realized where they were headed.</p>
<p>"Faith, wait." The other girl stopped. "We're not going to do something
suicidal, are we?"</p>
<p>"What? Like rush into the cave lair of our foes and do the superhero thing?
That was the
plan. And it doesn't have to be us. I just gotta get some of this unhealthy
aggression and
emotional distress outta me. Gotta love psychologists."</p>
<p>"You're gonna get some blood outta you too. I have to come. It's an
unwritten rule. We
might as well die together."</p>
<p>"How romantic." Faith said sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Look, I know what mom said wasn't the answer you were hoping for, I didn't
like it any
more then you did, but it doesn't change how I feel about you."</p>
<p>Faith started walking again. She couldn't look Buffy in the face, but she
kept talking.
"Her thumbs up woulda sealed it for us."</p>
<p>"I'm not gonna stop just cause she's got a problem with us. Maybe she'll
come around. All
Summers' women have a stubborn streak at first. Just takes time for
anything to get
through it."</p>
<p>"I've seen the stubborn streak twice. With you it usually gets my juices
flowin'," Faith
grinned to herself, still walking, "but with your mom, it doesn't make me
feel all that
great."</p>
<p>"Would you be upset if I said a part of me was happy about that?"</p>
<p>Faith turned around, halting once more. "Get out of the gutter,
B."</p>
<p>"You gonna make me?"</p>
<p>She couldn't step down from a challenge. She stepped up to Buffy. "I know
what you're
tryin' to do."</p>
<p>Buffy wrapped her arm around Faith's waist. "Do you?"</p>
<p>"Uh huh. You're trying to keep me from the cave."</p>
<p>"Is it working?" Faith nodded. "Good."</p>
<p>Buffy kissed her, and every thought left Faith's head. This was a 'I still
love you' kiss,
and she got the message loud and clear. After a few moments, Buffy stopped,
and her eyes
widened.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>Buffy pointed over Faith's shoulder, and Faith turned around to see Riley
standing in
front of her. She couldn't tell, but she thought there was a hurt
expression on his face.
It didn't matter. She wanted to pummel some bad guys, and one of them came
to her. She
wouldn't waste the opportunity. She assumed a fighting stance.</p>
<p>"Hang on a sec." Buffy said quietly. "Riley?"</p>
<p>He was quiet for what seemed like an eternity. "Buffy. There's things you
need to know."</p>
<p>Both slayers were shocked. Buffy even more so. The air felt like it had
been sucked out of
her lungs. He was…him again, she knew it. At least in personality. She
didn't know how,
but he was, and she wished she would pass out before she had to deal with
the situation.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>In Giles' house, they were waiting for Xander to come to. The boy was
sprawled on the
couch, a few nice bruises forming on his face. Anya was crouched by his
side, holding an
icepack to his head. She didn't regret what she did; he needed to have
something knocked
into him. Hopefully it was sense, but who knew? Still, she loved him.
Though she'd have to
work on different methods of showing it.</p>
<p>"Well, I think we can assume that his heart was in the right place." Giles
said.</p>
<p>"Can we also assume that his brain didn't go with his heart to this 'right
place'?" Anya
asked.</p>
<p>"Yes that's probably fairly accurate." Wesley said with a small smile. It
was always nice
to know that there was someone more bumbling than he was. Though, unlike
Xander, he was
improving.</p>
<p>"He could have just apologized, you know. Then we could have apologized,
maybe had a nice
risk-free conversation that didn't involve trying to play secret agent
soldier guy with
the bad side…" Willow trailed off.</p>
<p>"I think it's more than that." Tara said slowly. "I think…well, I'm
guessing…that he wants
to feel useful. You know, like a part of the group?"</p>
<p>"Why would he want to do that?" Anya asked like it was the silliest thing
she had ever
heard. "Oh, right. Friendship or whatever."</p>
<p>"I guess we all have a tendency to leave him out, but that's simply for -"
Giles started.</p>
<p>"His safety. We don't want him getting hurt." Willow said.</p>
<p>"But to him, everyone in this group has a pivotal role except for him.
Having had a
similar experience, I can identify." Wesley continued on. He didn't hold it
against them.
He had no idea what he had been getting himself into then. "But I was an
outsider coming
into an already functioning unit. Xander's been part of this from the
start. As you gained
abilities, Willow, you were no longer an occasional helper from
afar.</p>
<p>"You were in the thick of it, becoming an actual fighter. He has been left
behind, and I'd
imagine he feels very much alone."</p>
<p>Willow's face sunk. Was that what he thought? Was she responsible? Well, of
course she
was. Why didn't she it? Why wasn't she paying attention? Why…</p>
<p>"There's no way you could have known. He didn't say anything. There was no
way." Tara
said, putting her hand on Willow's shoulder, trying to be
comforting.</p>
<p>"But you did. How did you know and I didn't?"</p>
<p>Tara looked around quickly. "I…dunno. Just got a sense I guess."</p>
<p>"Why didn't he say anything? Why'd he keep it to himself?" Willow asked.
She wanted
answers.</p>
<p>Now it was Wesley's and Giles' turns to look around at the walls. "It's a
male…tendency."
Giles said.</p>
<p>Willow was confused, so Anya decided to clear it up. "You know how they
don't want to ask
for directions? Ever?" Willow nodded. "This is the same thing. It's the 'I
can handle
everything' approach. No matter how stupid it is."</p>
<p>"Well if you can't trust your girlfriend to knock you out, who can you
trust?" A newly
awakened, but somewhat groggy, Xander asked.</p>
<p>"You're awake!" Anya squealed happily, immediately kissing him. She then
stopped, and
slapped his face. "Don't ever do that again."</p>
<p>Before anyone could get a word in, the door opened, and Buffy and Faith
came in. Followed
by Riley, who had to crouch a little to get in the doorway. Faith sat on
the steps, and
everyone tensed.</p>
<p>"Okay. Let me explain." Buffy said.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Several hours later, the tension had dulled to a low ache. Explanations
were given and
Riley shared all the information he had. They didn't have time to dwell,
because with
almost everyone together finally, they leapt into the planning stage. All
personal
feelings aside, on Riley, Xander, on everything; when the group decided to
devise a course
of attack, they stayed focused on it.</p>
<p>From her position, Willow saw Faith still sitting on the steps. And as
Riley talked to
Xander, she saw him sneak glances at Buffy, who was kind of just staring at
nothing.
Seeing him again, back for real, had to be hard on her friend, Willow
mused. Like Buffy
didn’t know exactly what to do. Looking again at Faith, the other slayer
seemed to have
the same faraway expression.</p>
<p>Willow nudged Buffy's arm. "Maybe you better…"</p>
<p>Buffy looked, and saw Faith. She went over to the steps, knowing Riley was
watching.</p>
<p>"So what's this about them coming after me?" Xander asked him, making him
turn his head
back around.</p>
<p>"You failed, they'll most likely want to -"</p>
<p>"I get it." Xander shook his head. Why did he get himself involved? Why? At
least he was
back with his friends. If he failed anybody, though, he failed them. Now
they were going
to have to save him from another mistake. Why did he even bother?</p>
<p>"What do we do about the virus?" Tara asked.</p>
<p>"There's less risk to any of you if I take it." Riley said. "Adam expects
me back at
nightfall. Which is almost…now. I can get close. Probably keep the
Initiative busy too.
While you all handle the demons."</p>
<p>"We should see what spells we can do." Willow said quickly, handing the
disk to Riley. If
he got that in his system, he would no longer be invulnerable. He would be
able to be
killed. He'd remember that. Willow and Tara went off into their own
corner.</p>
<p>"How about you?" Anya asked.</p>
<p>Riley really didn't have an answer right then. Did he really want to live
as a machine? He
looked over at Giles and Wesley who were gathering weapons. And he looked
at Buffy again.
He couldn't have expected things to stay the same.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"Whatcha doin?" Buffy asked, sitting a step lower than Faith.</p>
<p>"Thinking how I wished I had gotten some more training in. And…how today
really isn't my
day."</p>
<p>"Hasn't been mine, either."</p>
<p>"He's back. Shouldn't you be all cheery?"</p>
<p>"I can't even look at him."</p>
<p>"But you've been playing him taking a bullet over and over in your head.
I'm starting to
get a headache."</p>
<p>"Have I? Sorry. I just…God." She looked at Faith closely. "We're not
getting back together
or anything. I mean he's not even…"</p>
<p>"I didn't think you were."</p>
<p>"Yes you did, and you have nothing to worry about. Promise. And just in
case you didn't
hear me the other couple hundred times, I love you."</p>
<p>"Never get tired of that." Faith smiled. "But he is back. Are you ever
gonna talk to him?
You had to notice him lookin' at ya. The guy's crushed, and I don't think
I'm the girl he
wants to ease his pain."</p>
<p>"I know. I -"</p>
<p>Buffy found herself stopping when a clawed hand ripped through the front
door and a leg
followed, reducing it to a pile on the floor. An angry, red-skinned demon
ran in, and they
got off the steps into fighting stances. There were other growls coming
from outside. The
