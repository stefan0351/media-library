<!-- Who Am I? \ Complications (Or - Begging For Some Deep Pain) -->

<p>Xander, Anya, Tara and Willow were still
waiting for Buffy and Faith to get back. Buffy had quickly run back to
them with
 Spike in tow simply saying to wait there
because the Initiative was up to something, and then took off. That had
been ten minutes ago. And Willow didn't know about anybody else, but she
was starting to worry. Granted there wasn't much they could do directly
where guys and guns were involved, but they had to do something. Buffy
and Faith should have been back.</p>
<p>Willow put on her resolve face. "They're
in trouble, I know they are. We should go help."</p>
<p>"They can take care of themselves." Xander
said rather flippantly. "They're the slayers right? Probably off 'doing'
something and forgot all about us."</p>
<p>Willow was taken aback by his sudden uncaring
attitude. Tara was a little shocked, and even Anya looked surprised.</p>
<p>"What's your problem with this?" Anya asked
him. "I mean, a lot of the women I granted wishes for ended up -"</p>
<p>"Faith's…she's done something to Buffy."</p>
<p>"Hey, they're not the only ones. Remember?"
Willow pointed out; getting more annoyed by the second.</p>
<p>Xander had an almost sad look on his face.
"Whatever she's doing… it must be affecting you too. I'll get Giles and
we'll -" He stopped in mid-sentence, thinking he had had finally understood.
He turned toward Tara, and began to stare at her accusingly.</p>
<p>Before she knew what she was doing, Willow
slapped Xander across the face. "Don't even think about yelling at her."</p>
<p>"I can't believe you did that." He said,
rubbing his face.</p>
<p>"I can't believe you're being such a jerk.
Tell Anya why you're so mad. Does she know what you and Faith did?"</p>
<p>"What's she talking about?" Anya asked.</p>
<p>Xander stared at his feet. "We…uh…before
I met you…Faith and I had kinda…a one night thing."</p>
<p>"You what?" She practically screamed, and
then slapped him.</p>
<p>"Take him and go fight somewhere else.
If he's not going to help, I don't want to...not see him right now." Willow
said.</p>
<p>Seeing him about to blame and yell at Tara,
and she knew he was because she had seen that look before, usually before
he yelled at Buffy, made her very mad at him right now. Plus the not wanting
to help keep their friends alive had her really peeved
 too.</p>
<p>"Oh, we're going to fight." Anya said icily.
"Let's go, Xander."</p>
<p>Willow looked at the now retreating Xander,
and then at Tara. With silent agreement, and apologies for Xander's behavior,
the two wiccas started running in the direction Buffy had gone.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>"The test run is going very well." The
lead scientist commented.</p>
<p>"Congratulations, Doctor. We might get
a few bonuses too." Graham said.</p>
<p>"Having two slayers to study would be a
dream, I have to admit. Even if it is in a purely post mortem capacity.
However, what interests me at the moment is Riley's belief that the one
slayer, Faith, had something to do with his death.</p>
<p>"Suppressing his memory seems to have created
an interesting side-effect."</p>
<p>"Well if he got that memory jumbled, what's
that mean for the others?"</p>
<p>"If you're worried about his recognizing
the Summers girl, don't be. If he were going to, it would have happened
already. He showed no reaction to seeing her. My guess is that Faith's
name has triggered an angry emotional response. A step up from the prototype."</p>
<p>"If the girls and the vampire escape from
the cemetery, I'm calling the team back. We can't risk running all over
town. And then we can come up with a tighter strategy."</p>
<p>"With any luck, they won't. I'll also have
to take a close look at Riley."</p>
<p>They focused on the monitors once again,
which allowed them to see from the perspective of any of the team members,
through the use of built in cameras in the headsets. Nobody moved, except
Riley, who kept approaching the slayers.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>All Buffy saw as she looked at Riley, though
it wasn't really him anymore, was a shell. A shell with dead, blank eyes.
There was anger in them too, though he probably wasn't real clear who he
was angry at. Well she was angry too. Angry at the Initiative for not letting
him find peace. For turning him into…a thing. A machine.</p>
<p>She had always heard that soldiers were
expendable to some military leaders. Grunts who protected somebody with
more importance whether they wanted to or not. That soldiers were simply
killing machines, and that if they died, there was always an endless supply
to replace them.</p>
<p>The Initiative apparently took it literally.
And if that wasn't bad enough, they made him human in appearance. Not like
Adam, who was just pieced together. It was harder this way, and Graham
must have known that.</p>
<p>She watched as Faith tried to roundhouse
Riley's stilettoed hand, but he simply knocked her away, and into the hands
of a commando. Riley focused on Buffy now, and pulled his arm back, prepared
to use his weapon.</p>
<p>Instead of hitting her chest as he had
planned, he sliced through Spike's side, because Buffy had lifted the vampire
up to block his attack. Spike cursed, and she pulled him down with her,
and they slid under Riley's legs, getting behind him.</p>
<p>Spike had had enough, so he elbowed Buffy
in the face, and she lost the weak grip she had still been holding him
with. He barreled through two commandos, and ran off. Buffy figured running
was a good idea too, so she kicked a gun out of a soldier's hand, which
she caught.</p>
<p>They all wanted to fire, but they had to
be careful not to hit Riley. He might have been close to indestructible,
but Graham told them not to take chances. But Buffy was close enough, so
that before she could fire the gun, one them was able to shoot her in the
shoulder, and she dropped, in pain.</p>
<p>Faith heard the shot. "Buffy!" She struggled
against her captor. "I'm giving you one warning. Let me go or you'll regret
it." He didn't budge.</p>
<p>She brought her head back into his, and
he loosened his grip some. Now that she could move her arms a little, she
grabbed his, and flipped him in front of her. Riley, thinking Buffy was
not worth his effort anymore, had turned back towards her. Faith grabbed
the downed commando, and threw him into Riley, impaling him on the large
stiletto-skewer.</p>
<p>Seeing them distracted, she was able to
run to Buffy's side, and crouched down over her. Then five commandos held
their weapons in the faces of the grounded slayers.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Willow and Tara ran into the cemetery,
and saw the fight immediately, even though they stood just inside the gates.
They needed to get closer, so they quietly inched forward, looking for
anything they could possibly use to help.</p>
<p>"So…what exactly are we going to do?" Tara
asked in a whisper.</p>
<p>"I…uh…haven't really thought that far ahead
yet." Willow confessed.</p>
<p>Tara spotted a possible solution to the
dilemma they were having. The great thing about vampires rising from graves
was that headstones and statues were knocked from their placements, and
down to the ground. They were close now, and they crouched to stay out
of view. And stones and parts of statues were all around them.</p>
<p>"Remember when we moved that soda machine?"
Tara questioned Willow.</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"Well…we could do it again."</p>
<p>"Move a soda machine?"</p>
<p>"No. All this," Tara looked around, "stuff."</p>
<p>"You think we can?"</p>
<p>"If we concentrate, and want it to work."</p>
<p>"I do. They need us."</p>
<p>Tara smiled, and then they grasped hands
and closed their eyes. They envisioned the commandos, the stones, Buffy
and Faith's position, moving the stones…and then things began to fly. The
majority of the objects hit their intended commando targets, knocking him
out cold.</p>
<p>A few ran for cover, and when Willow and
Tara opened their eyes, they shockingly recognized the larger man as Riley.
The stones hitting him were just being annoying distractions. But it was
enough.</p>
<p>They watched as Buffy and Faith ran in
their direction, Buffy leaning on Faith for support. When the slayers reached
them, they all started running out of the cemetery as fast as they could.</p>
<p>"Have I mentioned how glad I am that you're
on our side?" Faith asked.</p>
<p>Buffy managed a strained, "Ditto."</p>
<p>"Don't -" Willow started.</p>
<p>"Mention it." Tara finished.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Spike stumbled into the cave, holding his
side. He leaned up against the rock wall for support, and Adam came up
to him.</p>
<p>"You've been injured."</p>
<p>"Great deduction powers, mate. First the
damn slayers, then your bloody makers, and oh yeah. You've got a baby brother.
Congratulations."</p>
<p>"Riley."</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Willow and Tara entered Giles' first, and
then still supporting Buffy, came Faith. Xander and Anya were there, obviously
not speaking, as was evident by the looks on their faces. And the way Giles
appeared to be downing Advil, he had been there to listen to the stormy
fight. The older man immediately came over to them, as did Anya.</p>
<p>"We need to talk." She said.</p>
<p>"Not right now." Faith said.</p>
<p>"What happened?" Giles asked, trying to
support Buffy's other side. But then he saw the blood and the tear in the
shoulder area, and thought better of it. "Let's sit her on the kitchen
floor. I can take it out. Doesn't look too deep."</p>
<p>They moved towards the miniscule kitchen
area, Anya trailing.</p>
<p>"Yeah, she took a pretty good hit. Had
me worried, B."</p>
<p>"Gotta keep you on your game somehow."
Buffy joked.</p>
<p>"You had sex with Xander." Anya said, doing
a complete one eighty, changing the conversation in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>"I did. But you weren't on the scene yet.
And we haven't gotten down and dirty since. Okay?" Faith sighed.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"I don't want him, and there's nothing
you could possibly inflict any hurt on me."</p>
<p>Anya thought. "Well, he's really good in
bed, so I guess I should thank you."</p>
<p>"You're welcome. Are we done?"</p>
<p>"I'll go glare at him some more."</p>
<p>Faith smirked. Giles was getting what he
needed from his cabinets.</p>
<p>"How you holding up?" She asked Buffy.</p>
<p>"Better than Xander apparently."</p>
<p>"I can't believe how freaked I was when
I heard the shot."</p>
<p>"I'm here." Buffy placed Faith's hand on
her leg. "See?"</p>
<p>"Definitely…" Now was not the time to be
thinking 'those' thoughts. Dancing was one thing…. "Um…I'm gonna go watch
the fireworks. Let G-Man tend to ya."</p>
<p>"Okay." Buffy smiled awkwardly.</p>
<p>Faith got up as Giles crouched at Buffy's
other side, and began to work.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>The tension from before had returned, but
now that they were in an enclosed space, it seemed ten times as worse.
Xander sat Indian-style on the floor by the TV, but it wasn't on. Faith
sat at one end of the couch, and Willow and Tara sat at the other. Xander
was watching them through the reflection on the screen.</p>
<p>Anya had given him the silent treatment
for about five more minutes, and because of his not wanting to talk her,
she walked out. Deep down he knew he should've said something to her, but
when he got angry, his rational side shut off, and he blocked everything
out. He had a problem with rage.</p>
<p>"So that forgiving me thing was an act?"
Faith asked.</p>
<p>She was tired of this. Slayer hearing was
great, but when a place was totally silent she could hear the littlest
things. Like the wheezing sound Xander made from his nose when he inhaled.
It was annoying her.</p>
<p>"If I had known what you were going to
do, I never would have." He replied, still facing the TV.</p>
<p>"Last time I checked, B and I taking the
extra step doesn't affect anything other than the two of us."</p>
<p>"Well it does. It affects everything."</p>
<p>"Actually, you seem like the only one with
the hang up. But if you're gonna keep acting this way full-time, let me
know so I can ignore you permanently, okay?"</p>
<p>"You've been doing that ever since -"</p>
<p>"Since we screwed? Do you want me to apologize
for it or something? Ain't gonna happen. You went into it knowing the score.
I'm sorry if you got the wrong impression, but that's the way it went down,
and you weren't objecting."</p>
<p>"Like it would have mattered."</p>
<p>"Don't try to tell me what I would've done
if you said no. I gave you what you wanted even though I could've found
other ways to alleviate the tension. Wouldn't have been the first time."</p>
<p>Xander turned around. "So you were doing
me a favor? Is that it?"</p>
<p>"You lust after every woman you look at,
and I know a meaningful relationship isn't what you're hoping for when
you drool on the floor. When someone finally acts on it, gives you your
fantasy, you act all shocked that that's all you get. One good lay isn't
love."</p>
<p>"You don't know what you're talking about.
I love Anya."</p>
<p>"Now you do, but if love was the most important
thing to you in the beginning, you woulda stopped the 'sex only' thing
sooner."</p>
<p>Xander silently cursed. He was losing.
"How do you know what love is?"</p>
<p>"Because when I look at Buffy, getting
her horizontal isn't the number one thing on my list. I love her, and the
physical stuff, it's like a bonus. Something…I have to earn first."</p>
<p>Xander scoffed. "You haven't slept with
her?" She shook her head. "And you don't want to? I believe that. Right."</p>
<p>"I'm not saying it's not on the list, there's
just other things that are just as cool."</p>
<p>"Yeah, like what?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>As Giles pulled the bullet out with a pair
of sterilized tweezers, they both listened to bits and pieces of the conversation
going on in the other room. Buffy hissed as it was removed, and he immediately
applied a disinfectant-soaked gauze pad to the wound. She used her hand
to keep it there, applying pressure, as he got up to throw the bullet away.</p>
<p>"I don't think I need to tell you how lucky
you are." Giles said.</p>
<p>"Slaying's all a risk. I'm alive…but I'll
be careful. I always am." Buffy said.</p>
<p>"I still worry." He smiled at her. "What
happened exactly?"</p>
<p>"Commando ambush, almost got staked by
an Adamized Riley…" Her eyes softened as she said the last part.</p>
<p>"Good God. To do that to a man…"</p>
<p>"Horrible, right? I thought so too. Looks
like I'll end up killing my ex-lover yet again. I'm really not liking the
cycle my life tends to go in, Giles."</p>
<p>He put his hand gently on her shoulder.
She winced, but the pain was already fading. "Will you be all right?"</p>
<p>"Sure. I've still got some youthful innocence
left to destroy." Buffy laughed quietly. "I'm good at the black cloud stuff,
aren't I?"</p>
<p>"Your reaction…nobody can blame you for
it. But remember, you have -"</p>
<p>"Support. Yeah, I know." She smiled at
him again, as they both caught the conversation going on between Faith
and Xander more clearly.</p>
<p>"…I love her, and the physical stuff, it's
like a bonus. Something…I have to earn first." Faith was saying.</p>
<p>Buffy had a million-watt smile on her face.
One, every time she heard Faith say the 'L word', good feelings overflowed,
and she wanted to hear it again and again. She never got tired of it. And
two, because Faith felt she had to earn something to get close to her.
Buffy felt like she was the one who had to earn access to the final gate.</p>
<p>Then she looked up at Giles, and realized
what he had just heard. "Um…look, Giles…"</p>
<p>"I knew."</p>
<p>"Xander?"</p>
<p>"No. I've noticed things change between
you. Nothing obvious, but I recognize love when I see it."</p>
<p>"Oh. So you know that's what it is and
not…"</p>
<p>"She loves you. That's clear enough to
me. It was a shock at first, because I had never seen Faith look at anybody
in that way before."</p>
<p>"I can't believe you're so cool with this.
I'm glad, though. Really glad."</p>
<p>"I have no reason not to be. You two, I
assume, know what you're doing, and who am I to stand in the way of that?"</p>
<p>"Wish Xander could be as fine with it."</p>
<p>"When he acts like this, there's no getting
through to him." Giles shook his head. The boy could be real hardheaded
when he wanted to be. Then he remembered Olivia's call. "I hate to say
this…but I'm afraid I have some bad news."</p>
<p>"What could possibly make this day any
worse?"</p>
<p>"The Council's…returning for Faith."</p>
<p>Buffy had been holding her breath. "Tell
me that was just a really bad joke."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid not."</p>
<p>"Then hurry up and get me something I can
hit." She said as she clenched her fists. It wasn't fair.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Buffy entered the room ahead of Giles,
and sat close to Faith on the couch.</p>
<p>"This is the other stuff I'm talking about."
She looked over at Buffy, and then at Giles' solemn expression. "What is
it?"</p>
<p>"Guess everybody should hear cause you'd
all find out anyway." Buffy said.</p>
<p>"Just say it, B. You're driving me nuts."</p>
<p>"The Council is…they want to try and take
you…again."</p>
<p>Faith shut her eyes. No, this couldn't
be happening to her. Not again. Just when she was getting used to where
she was and her new life…and then she felt Buffy hugging her and whispering
in her ear.</p>
<p>"Don't you start getting crazy ideas. I'm
not letting you go without a fight."</p>
<p>"Buf -"</p>
<p>She put her finger to Faith's lips. "No.
Okay? Positive thinking. We'll figure something out."</p>
<p>Xander stood up. "There's no need to tax
our brains over this. We've got Adam, the Initiative, Spike, and Riley
to worry about. Why add another problem to the list?"</p>
<p>"I'd keep quiet if I were you, Xander."
Giles warned him.</p>
<p>"I agree." Willow said, glaring at him.</p>
<p>"You can't be okay with this, Giles. The
four of them -"</p>
<p>"It's not something I'm concerned about.
It's their lives, and I won't get involved unless I'm asked. You'd be better
off doing the same."</p>
<p>Buffy stood up, and went face to face with
Xander. "What is your problem? Is it because we're all girls? No that can't
be it. That's every guy's fantasy. It can't just be because of Faith, because
I saw the looks you were giving Will and Tara, and you have a girlfriend…so
what is it?"</p>
<p>"I'm just trying to look out for -"</p>
<p>"Cut the crap."</p>
<p>"She'll hurt you. She's a slut." Buffy
slapped him across the face. That was happening to him a lot. Only this
slap knocked him to the ground. "And she's evil." He said, trying to pinpoint
where the bruise was going to be.</p>
<p>"You don't know when to keep quiet, do
you?" Faith asked. "And I like to think of that period as my 'maybe if
I had had
 decent therapy it wouldn't have gone that
far' phase. It's long past."</p>
<p>"No it isn't just you, Faith. He's disliked
everyone I've ever been with. He's only really gotten the opportunity to
yell about you and Angel. Oh he got some good shots in on Riley too." Buffy
said.</p>
<p>"He even had the nerve to not like Oz when
we first started to go out." Willow commented.</p>
<p>"So he's just a guy who's not satisfied
with what he has, and despises anybody who's with what he can't have. Which
is every woman on the planet. Typical guy." Faith said. "Sad really."</p>
<p>"It really is." Tara said, speaking for
the first time. "Losing best friends over something so silly."</p>
<p>"I think you'd better leave, Xander." Giles
said.</p>
<p>Xander got to his feet. "But it's vamp
rush hour." Willow tossed him a cross and a bottle of holywater that was
on the table.</p>
<p>"Why help Faith? Cause I love her, Xander.
When you can deal, then we'll talk."</p>
<p>Buffy sat back down next to Faith, and
Willow and Tara started talking. Giles went to go make tea. Xander walked
out, not looking back. When he was gone, Willow spoke up.</p>
<p>"Why did he have to do that? I really don't
like being mad at him. I can't believe I hit him."</p>
<p>"Look, I know you guys are close," Faith
said, "but he's -"</p>
<p>"That's Xander's dark side. He can't slay
his anger out, so he just lashes out. It usually blows over, but, and I
didn't want to hit him either, I didn't know what else to do." Buffy said.</p>
<p>"There's nothing more any of you could
possibly say to him." Giles said from the kitchen. "The most pressing matter
at hand is to decide what to do about the Council. They'll be arriving
tomorrow night."</p>
<p>"That soon?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"Plus the cyber monsters and soldier guys."
Tara said.</p>
<p>"And the list goes on." Faith muttered.</p>
<p>"Let's get to it then." Buffy said.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Inside the Initiative, Riley sat in specialized
quarters. All he knew were facts and to listen to orders when given. The
emptiness and plainness of the room he was in, didn't even register. He
was controlled, which was why the outside signal entering his head surprised
him some. It was a signal he had never felt before, but was somehow strangely
familiar.</p>
<p>That's when he could make out the voice.</p>
<p>"Brother..."</p>
