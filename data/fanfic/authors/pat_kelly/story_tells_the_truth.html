<p>February 2004</p>

<p>Magic Box, Sunnydale</p>

<p>I walk through the door, a nervous smile on my face. I've been out of college one year now, out of the whole educational system, and this reminder has to creep up on me. And it's not like this is a one shot deal. There'll be another, and another, and another, and they won't stop until I've gone the way of the dodo. To make things worse, my current job is calling people up and getting them to buy things. Yeah, that's right. Telemarketing. People are very foul-mouthed. And that's not the kind of profession you want to advertise.</p>

<p>But I bully people until they purchase things. It's a skill I learned from Anya. I think I sell the most stuff, so I get paid a little more. And hey, at least I get to work from home. Plus, I make enough money to live off of while I get past my writer's block. It was her idea. I switched my major at the end of sophomore year to English, cause she said our lives would make a great story.</p>

<p>And it has. I'm a best-selling author. Literary genius, even. That's what she says, and I let her. I already have two books out, and I'm working on the third one now. I started the first one in the middle of junior year, and it all just came out. It is about my life. Not hard to write. All the names and places have been changed to protect the innocent, that sort of thing. Anne the Vampire Slayer and Jeeves is her Looker. She and her friends are known as the Scrappy Gang. You get the idea. My pen name is Summer. My publisher says it adds to the feel of the book. Whatever that means. </p>

<p>No, royalties don't pay that much. Though they're starting to increase. But because nobody knows it's me writing these books, I'd have to tell them I'm a Tele-marketer. Understand?</p>

<p>Pays the bills, and it's kinda therapeutic. I'm reduced to giving mom rent, though. I love my family, okay? I'm not ready to move out. We haven't found a place yet, anyway. And Dawn's still around, just about to turn eighteen. Ugh. After the whole deal with Glory, no way am I going to reflect on that, she was given a choice. She chose to stay my sister. Some days that's a good thing, other days...</p>

<p>I'm drifting. Must focus on the problem at hand. The dilemma. Then I see her, and I can't seem to remember anything. My best friend, my girlfriend, my shoulder to cry on, and any kind of sappy, "Hallmark-esque" sayings you can think of.</p>

<p>Willow. How did we finally get together, you ask? Be good and I'll tell you the story.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Okay, I guess you're being good enough. Legs and arms inside the memory time machine at all times, please. It could get bumpy; I don't like to stay in one place too long. If you fall out into limbo, not my fault.</p>

<p>
December 1999</p>

<p>Lowell House</p>

<p>UC Sunnydale, Sunnydale</p>

<p>Riley Finn was shooting baskets through the mini-hoop that was attached to his door. Things had changed so fast. It had been simple a few weeks ago. He was just team leader of a secret, military organization that hunted monsters and demons before, and he had kept that to himself really well. Then he met Buffy Summers. But things had still been normal. She was just a student in the Psychology 101 class. Things fell apart.</p>

<p>First, he realized he liked her, then he tried to let her know that. A little while later, he found out she was the fabled "slayer" all the hostiles talked about, and she found out about his other job. They stopped the Gates of Hell from opening in the torched high school too. He also spilled information he shouldn't have, but what bothered him the most was that he had been pushing her so hard to give them a shot.</p>

<p>After all, they were both fry cooks, weren't they? Though he had a feeling the only thing he had been doing was pushing her away, because even he realized that he had been coming on a little strong. And she was so attached to her friends, especially Willow since that Oz guy left her, and he didn't know if he could break into that circle.</p>

<p>Someone was knocking now.</p>

<p>"Come in." He said.</p>

<p>Buffy peaked in, walked inside, but stayed by the door.</p>

<p>"You never called. So I didn't know...I figured we'd better, you know, deal with this."</p>

<p>"Sorry. Just envisioning all the ways the higher ups can kill me."</p>

<p>"They could hang you in the Town Square." She thought. "Does Sunnydale even have a square?"</p>

<p>"I'll add that to the list."</p>

<p>"They're not gonna kill you." She assured him.</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Cause my friends aren't going to say anything. Neither am I. We know how to keep secrets."</p>

<p>He sat on his bed with a chuckle. "I guess you do." There were a few seconds of silence. "Look, Buffy, about us..."</p>

<p>"Yeah...um...I can't, Riley. I might be condemning myself to eternal unhappiness, but I can't be with you. I just keep seeing the same cycle as before. We're happy for awhile, something bad happens, nothing's ever the same, one of us doesn't pick up on the drifting, then one of us goes away and gets hurt. I have to start following my own advice."</p>

<p>"So we're still doomed." Riley sighed.</p>

<p>"In the relationship sense. Not the friendship sense. If we could work together, in secret, obviously, we could help each other out. You're a nice guy, just..."</p>

<p>"I get it. Nice twist on the 'Let's just be friends' speech."</p>

<p>"I know it seems like I'm 'pessimist girl,' and maybe I am, but I'm also 'realist girl.' I'm trying to save us both heartache here. Better to do it now before we invest, cause then interest piles up and..." She trailed off. "Enough with the imagery, Buffy." The slayer shut herself up.</p>

<p>"Thanks." He couldn't look at her.</p>

<p>"I'll...go now. I really am sorry." </p>

<p>She walked out into the hall, and went to close the door. All he needed was time to think and clear his head. Then it would all be okay. She hoped.</p>

<p>"I just wanted you to be happy. I thought I could be the person to do that." He said, before she closed the door all the way.</p>

<p>"I appreciate that. And I'm sure we'll both be. Eventually. Fate can't be cruel forever, right? Just gotta find the right person."</p>

<p>Then she was gone, and he had his answer. Even though she had just crushed his hopes, he had to smile. Whoever it was she was looking for, or waiting for, was really lucky. She was special, one of a kind. </p>

<p>He needed to clear his head. Maybe he'd call Forrest and Graham. He could go for a basketball game. This time he'd be the one taking their money.</p>

<p>
Twenty Minutes Later</p>

<p>Xander's Basement, Sunnydale</p>

<p>Xander and Willow had been trying to watch TV, but a charged up Spike was now blocking their view, and they had no choice but to stare at him and look uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"What's this? Sitting around watching the telly while there's evil still a foot?" The vampire turned off the television. "That's not very industrious of you. I say we go out there," Spike rubbed his hands together, "and kick a little demon ass! What? Can't go without your Buffy, is that it? Too chicken? Let's find her! She is the Chosen One after all." His audience remained silent. "Come on! Vampires! Grrr! Nasty! Let's annihilate them. For justice...and for...the safety of puppies...and Christmas, right? Let's *fight* that evil! Let's *kill* something!" </p>

<p>Just then, Buffy walked through the basement door, and her two friends quickly got behind her, using her as a shield.</p>

<p>Xander pointed at Spike. "Save us! I think he took 'wowie pills.'"</p>

<p>"I think he's drunk." Willow said. "Really drunk."</p>

<p>"Hey, that's not nice. I'm in full control of myself." Spike was defensive. "I just happen to be enthusiastic."</p>

<p>Buffy raised her eyebrows. "About what?"</p>

<p>Spike smiled. "Destroying the forces of darkness."</p>

<p>"Destroying the -?" The slayer looked skeptical, and then began to laugh. Hard. This went on for several seconds, and the vampire got annoyed. "Oh God. Thanks Spike. I needed that."</p>

<p>"What? I'm being bloody serious."</p>

<p>"Of course you are." She nodded, giggled, then walked past him to turn on the TV. "So guys, what's on?"</p>

<p>"Cosby Show rerun." Xander said, sitting back down on his bed. </p>

<p>"It'll do." Buffy shrugged, sitting as well.</p>

<p>"Ooh!" Willow said suddenly. "That reminds me. Jello?"</p>

<p>"Fridge." Xander directed her.</p>

<p>She went to get some.</p>

<p>Spike looked around at the team, and then began marching toward the door. "Fine. I'll go it alone. I don't need any of you losers to battle the bad guys. I'm gonna show them who runs this town. I'll make 'em cower. I'll -"</p>

<p>"You have fun." Buffy interrupted.</p>

<p>"If you come in late, try to be quiet. And leave your shoes outside. I don't want dirt on my floor." Xander said.</p>

<p>"Try not to make the demons too mad." Willow advised, coming back with a Jello cup and sitting. When Spike left, the three of them shook their heads. "Um...so, Buffy, you and Riley...?"</p>

<p>"No longer a possibility." Buffy said, and watched the redhead frown. "It's okay, Will. And don't think I don't appreciate your matchmaking efforts, cause I do."</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't..." She knew she was caught. "I wish it would've worked." She hid her small smile.</p>

<p>"There's lots of reasons, but a main one was, it's not the right time. I'll know when it is, but right now I'm enjoying single life and the group-time thing. Seeing the high school, I kinda missed it. It is where I met you guys. Now it's burnt and destroyed. I don't want us to be destroyed."</p>

<p>Willow shook her head. "Me either." She entwined her fingers, bringing her hands together. "One piece. Whole. Together. Much more fun that way." </p>

<p>
"Yeah. I've been 'Distracted and Depressed Buffy' for too long. 'Friend Buffy' wants to come and hang out for awhile." She put her arms around her two friends' shoulders.</p>

<p>"We're happy to have her." Xander said. "And hey, if 'Exhibitionist Buffy' wants to join us too..."</p>

<p>"Xander!" The girls yelled at him.</p>

<p>
February 2000</p>

<p>Stevenson Hall</p>

<p>UC Sunnydale, Sunnydale</p>

<p>Finally back in her own body, Buffy had just returned from the church, still a little disoriented. And preoccupied. Not so much over Faith, because she didn't expect the other slayer to come back. The whole experience was incredibly surreal. They, the Council included, had labeled Faith, and they didn't even give her the time of day anymore. It was sad, but didn't she deserve it? </p>

<p>She came after her mom, and stole her body. Though, Buffy realized, if someone had stabbed her and put her in a coma, she'd lash out too. That last moment, when their hands were clasped and they switched back, Buffy saw something in Faith's eyes. A deep pain...regret? Well, there was no point in this. Faith was gone. And okay, maybe she was preoccupied over her, but there was another thing that battled for her pondering time.</p>

<p>Who was this Tara person? She and Willow had been going to the Bronze and hanging out almost twenty-four hours a day ever since they went on Winter Break. They worked through the pain, went to movies, but she had never met Tara. The name hadn't even come up. Also, how come she felt territorial the first time she laid Faith's eyes on the girl?</p>

<p>As if on cue, Willow entered the room.</p>

<p>"There you are. We couldn't find you; the cops were being 'standing in the way'-ish. And I was a little bit worried, a little bit concerned..." The redhead said, sitting next to her friend on the bed.</p>

<p>"Well, you can stop now. Just had a lot to think about." The slayer responded.</p>

<p>"Faith?"</p>

<p>"Far away by now."</p>

<p>"Good." Willow gave a firm nod of approval.</p>

<p>"You never liked her did you? Even before she went rouge."</p>

<p>"She slept with -"</p>

<p>Buffy knew, but was that the only reason?</p>

<p>"Um...how long have you known Tara?" She interrupted her friend.</p>

<p>"Remember the not so wicca, Wicca group?" Buffy nodded. "I met her there. For awhile we just kinda said 'hey', but lately we've been doing spells together. She's a real witch."</p>

<p>"Yeah?" She didn't know why, but she didn't like this. Something was telling her not to, and she wasn't focusing on what Willow was saying anymore.</p>

<p>"I couldn't wait for her to meet you, but she's shy...and that's..." Willow looked at the blonde. "Buffy?"</p>

<p>She blinked. "Hmm?"</p>

<p>"You looked like you were somewhere else."</p>

<p>"Nope. Right here."</p>

<p>"Do you like her?"</p>

<p>"We really didn't speak, Will."</p>

<p>"First impression?"</p>

<p>"She seems nice."</p>

<p>Buffy wasn't sure if Willow bought that, but the redhead was smiling, so she figured that she had. </p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>
April 2000</p>

<p>Willy's Place, Sunnydale</p>

<p>Oz was sitting at a table, finishing his beer. He had just said goodbye to Willow, so after his glass was empty, he was leaving town. To think that she would still be waiting for him was a foolish mistake on his part. And he really did have to go this time. If his wolf could hurt her, if he could get angry with her that easily, then she wasn't safe, and the last thing he wanted to do was hurt her. She hadn't chosen him, and he'd have to come to grips with that.</p>

<p>He looked up to see Buffy come into the bar. He hated confrontations, and he was fairly certain there was going to be one, but she just found him and sat down in the chair across from the one he was sitting in. They stared at one another for several seconds, not sure what the other was going to say.</p>

<p>"Beer?" He asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head. "Bad experience." He nodded, and took a sip. "Did you talk?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"I'm guessing that she..."</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>She flinched, and then frowned at him. "I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"I should understand better than anyone."</p>

<p>"Understand what?"</p>

<p>"That things change."</p>

<p>Buffy smirked. "Leaving?"</p>

<p>"Soon." Oz answered.</p>

<p>"Where to?"</p>

<p>He shrugged. "Heard Devon and the band moved out to LA. Might still have an opening for a guitarist."</p>

<p>"Good luck. When the first CD comes out, we'll be sure to buy it."</p>

<p>"Appreciate it." He took one last gulp, and set the glass and five bucks down on the table. "Keep her safe."</p>

<p>"Always."</p>

<p>Oz walked out, and Buffy thought she might have a drink after all. Willow had made her choice.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>May 2000</p>

<p>Giles' House, Sunnydale</p>

<p>Buffy hated arguments, but now she was stuck with an angry Willow, an angry Xander, and a drunk Giles. Why? Because all she wanted to do was keep them safe?</p>

<p>"This is stupid." Buffy said, exhausted.</p>

<p>"Stupid? So you finally have the guts to say it to my face?" Xander came back at her.</p>

<p>"I didn't say you were stupid! So...stop being an idiot and let me fix this!" </p>

<p>'Wrong thing to say!' The slayer mentally chastised herself, as Xander sat on the couch, sighing.</p>

<p>"Okay, I need you. I need both of you. All the time! Just...not now. Adam is very dangerous."</p>

<p>"Wait. How do you need me, really?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"You're...good with the computer stuff." The hacker nodded. "And-and there's the witch stuff."</p>

<p>She glared. "Witch stuff? What exactly do you mean by 'witch stuff'?" </p>

<p>"You guys, what is happening? Haven't we been practically inseparable? Where's this coming from?"</p>

<p>"You all of have been, but where does that leave me?" Giles asked drunkenly.</p>

<p>The ex-watcher put down his drink and tried to sit, but he missed the chair and fell to the floor. They all looked guilty then.</p>

<p>"Yeah, inseparable is one way to put it, but don't think I didn't catch on!" Xander started again. "I call it spending pity time with 'Xander the Jobless'!"</p>

<p>"How is you not having a job our fault?" Buffy asked him.</p>

<p>"And how could you think we pity you?" Willow was astonished.</p>

<p>Xander didn't have an answer, so he just continued his tirade before he ran out of steam. </p>

<p>"And if I did join the Army, I'd be great! You know why? Cause they might give me a job that couldn't be done by any well-trained Border Collie."</p>

<p>"That's it. I'm going to bed." Giles announced, trying to pull his sweater off and stumbling up the stairs.</p>

<p>"No, you'd do wonderful in the Army. Hey, do you think the umbilical cord between you and Anya can stretch that far?" Willow asked sarcastically.</p>

<p>"I knew it!" Xander pointed his finger accusingly. "I knew you hated her!"</p>

<p>Giles' sweater dropped down, and fell on Xander's head. He pulled it off quickly.</p>

<p>"Look, I'm not the one being judgmental here. I'll leave that territory to you and Buffy."</p>

<p>"Judgmental? If I was anymore open-minded about the choices you two make my whole brain would fall out!" Buffy defended herself.</p>

<p>Xander huffed. "Just because you're better than us doesn't mean that you can be all superior!"</p>

<p>"You guys, stop this! What happened to you today?"</p>

<p>"It's not today!" Willow insisted. "Buffy, things have been wrong for a while! Don't you see that?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean wrong?"</p>

<p>"Well, they certainly haven't been right, since Tara. We have to face it. You can't handle Tara being my girlfriend."</p>

<p>The air was just sucked out of the room. Xander gaped, Buffy looked down at her feet, and Giles...</p>

<p>"Bloody hell!"</p>

<p>The slayer slowly met her redheaded friend's eyes. "Maybe I can't."</p>

<p>She left the house, and Willow stared after her.</p>

<p>"Where's she going?" Xander questioned.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>The Next Day</p>

<p>En Route to Initiative Complex</p>

<p>UC Sunnydale, Sunnydale</p>

<p>Willow and Buffy were scaling down the elevator shaft in Lowell House, fitted with harnesses, holding onto ropes, using their feet to walk down the shaft slowly. They had discovered that Spike was the one who had planted those thoughts into their heads, and they all felt like idiots. At least concerning Xander. But they had been neglecting Giles, and Buffy knew there was truth to how she felt about Willow's choices.</p>

<p>The slayer had spent the entire night thinking, and figuring out why she was so put off by Tara. The answer wasn't as surprising as she thought it should've been, but then again, it's not like she hadn't expressed it before. It just meant more than she had originally thought. And the idea that they might...it was very appealing to her. She didn't sense any doom. It was what she had been looking for.</p>

<p>Figured it would be right in front of her the whole time. </p>

<p>She turned to Willow. "How you doing?"</p>

<p>"Super. What was I thinking using stairs all this time?" Willow answered, trying to hide her fear.</p>

<p>"Okay." They kept descending in silence. After a few moments, she spoke again. "Will -"</p>

<p>"No, really, Buffy. It's not as scary as I thought."</p>

<p>"No. That's not what I was going to say." She took a deep breath. "The reason I'm having a hard time with Tara being your girlfriend -"</p>

<p>"Is the same reason I didn't like Faith." Willow smiled. "Even though I know you two never...did you?"</p>

<p>Buffy stopped going down. "What?"</p>

<p>The redhead stopped as well. "Tara's not my girlfriend, Buffy. I met her in the group and we do spells, like I told you, I even know she likes me, but I told her no. And she respects that. She's been helping me."</p>

<p>"Helping you?"</p>

<p>"Ever since 'Vampire Me', it's been in the back of my mind that I might be...kinda gay. Then Oz left, and things got really confusing. I started having thoughts I wasn't sure I should've been having. To deal, I helped Riley, but when you started spending time together, I was...upset. I missed being with you. You made me feel like I existed when everybody else just walked on by."</p>

<p>"Will..." Tears were forming.</p>

<p>"Then Tara came along, and besides being a witch like me, she was kinda gay. When that didn't scare me off, we started talking. She helped me realize that being kinda gay wasn't so bad, and she helped me figure out my feelings. Everything was making sense. If I came to you, that would've risked what we have, and I didn't wanna lose you. I needed to know, so when I finally introduced her to you, and you got all jealous..." </p>

<p>Buffy blushed. "Did not." </p>

<p>"I knew then. Then Oz came back and I told him I couldn't be with him anymore."</p>

<p>"But he said that you..." Buffy trailed off. "He never did say Tara's name, I guess...but, you told me you had to choose between them." Willow nodded. "You were just seeing how I'd react, weren't you?" She nodded again. "So you toyed with my emotions? My best friend?"</p>

<p>Willow bit her lip. "Uh...kinda. Yeah..."</p>

<p>"That fight between us last night. You started it to test me some more?"</p>

<p>"No. It started cause you don't understand that you can't tell us we can't help. We're gonna do it anyway. Cause we love you, and we wanna protect you as much as you wanna protect us. Spike got me all confused and doubting though, so I snuck Tara in." </p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>Willow's expression was apologetic. "I'm sorry I manipulated. I just...after Oz; I realized how much love could hurt. If I told you and you didn't feel the same way...I didn't wanna be hurt again. You know how that feels."</p>

<p>"You're right." Buffy sighed. "I've gotta stop playing boss, and I'll work on that. Promise. But you...you were sneaky, devious, secretive..." Willow cringed. "And I'm glad you were." She smiled, and Willow slowly did. </p>

<p>"You are?"</p>

<p>"Listen. You can tell me anything. We've been through so much, and I wouldn't throw our friendship away no matter what. You are my best friend, and nothing could ever change that. Nothing."</p>

<p>Willow had tears now. "Buffy..."</p>

<p>"I couldn't get why it was hurting, and then the light bulb turned on. She got you and I didn't. What I'm saying is, that there's friendship, and now there's, I love you in 'that way.'"</p>

<p>They let go of their ropes, and hugged one another. </p>

<p>"Me too. I love you in 'that way' too." The hacker said, holding onto Buffy tightly. Then they started dropping faster. Really fast. "Falling now!"</p>

<p>They landed with their feet touching the elevator, still hugging.</p>

<p>"Wow." Willow remarked. "This is...wow."</p>

<p>"Definite wowage." Buffy smiled. "Tara was in on it the whole time?"</p>

<p>"It was half her idea." The hacker thought about what just happened. "So I...and you...and we...? Wow." She was beaming. "Uh...you and Faith...never...?"</p>

<p>"No! Now try and stay in the moment."</p>

<p>Willow was relieved. "Sorry...you know me I...think too much, and..."</p>

<p>"Willow?"</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"Less thinking, more kissing." And kiss they did. When Xander reached the elevator, he had to clear his throat to get their attention. He did, and they tackled him in a hug. "Xander!" </p>

<p>"Oh, wonderful Xander!" Willow exclaimed.</p>

<p>"You know we love you, right?" </p>

<p>"We totally do!" </p>

<p>"Can I get in on the kissing then?" He asked hopefully.</p>

<p>"No." Buffy told him.</p>

<p>"But we still love you." Willow reminded him.</p>

<p>August 2000</p>

<p>Dawson's Beach, Sunnydale</p>

<p>Xander, Anya, and Tara were watching Willow and Buffy play catch down by the ocean. Willow "tossed" Buffy the Nerf football without using her hands, and the slayer started to chase her. The two of them ran all the way up to the rest of the group, and the redhead collapsed onto the blanket.</p>

<p>"We agreed, didn't we?" Buffy asked. "No magick during any kind of gaming activity. Including checkers."</p>

<p>"You did." Tara backed her up with a smile. "I was a witness."</p>

<p>"Yeah. What do you call it?"</p>

<p>"A verbal contract." Anya supplied.</p>

<p>"Right. Verbal contract." </p>

<p>Willow stuck her tongue out. It had been three months since they moved to the next level. And they had embraced all the new facets that came with the expanded relationship. She didn't understand why they could make love in midair but she couldn't cheat at checkers. That just didn't make sense.</p>

<p>"I said it before and I'll say it again." Xander spoke while checking the grill. "Twosome of cuteness."</p>

<p>Buffy smirked. "I think I need more suntan lotion. For breaking the rules of the contract, you have to apply the stuff, Will."</p>

<p>"How is that a punishment?" Anya wondered.</p>

<p>"I to fail to see the bad." Xander added.</p>

<p>Tara just handed Willow the lotion and grinned. "How's your mom handling e-everything, Buffy?"</p>

<p>The slayer laid down on the stomach and let Willow get to work. "Okay, I guess. Like every other big revelation in my life, she's working through it. Just needs time. But she knows I'm happy." She smiled.</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't you be? You've got me as your slave girl." Willow huffed.</p>

<p>"Are you not enjoying yourself?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say that."</p>

<p>"Honey, what's taking the food so long?" Anya asked. "My stomach doesn't like to be kept waiting."</p>

<p>"The fire won't start." Xander complained.</p>

<p>Willow looked up from her task, and pointed at the grill. "Ignis incende." </p>

<p>Her girlfriend pulled on her arm, making her stop lotioning, and gave her a kiss.</p>

<p>"Look at you. Got that Witch-fu down." Buffy said proudly. "Been teaching her some new ones, Tara?"</p>

<p>"She came up with that one all by herself." The blonde witch answered.</p>

<p>Willow blushed under all the praise. "It's no big. You just have to balance the elements so when you affect one, you don't wind up causing..." The sky got dark suddenly, and they could hear thunder. Then the rain came pouring down. "I didn't do it! I didn't do it!" </p>

<p>February 2004</p>

<p>Magic Box, Sunnydale</p>

<p>Welcome back. Have a good trip? Great. If I lost anybody, you know, to a wormhole or something, I'm really sorry. So that's the tale. Told you I didn't stay in one place too long. And really, who would've wanted to sit through my months of angst and fear and sadness? I did what any good storyteller would do. Give you enough leading up events, the pivotal ones, and then get to the good stuff. And some storytellers don't. Some will go on for twenty pages describing a rock. Shudder.</p>

<p>Besides, I like happy stuff. A lot of my books are dark for awhile, and sometimes I wish they weren't, but all the stuff I write about is necessary and it is my life. I wouldn't change a thing, because then I might not be where I am today. Today I'm happy. Before you ask, I'm not going to describe the intimate moments between Willow and I. Some stuff is private, you know. Though it is pretty incredible. I'm such a tease, aren't I?</p>

<p>Oh wait. You're in the middle of our sophomore year on TV, aren't you? Maple's with Terri, and Clark left Anne? That's what happens when some guy asks you if he can make your life and writing into a television show. They change things. As soon as the first book came out, the Whedon guy was knocking on my door. Television dramas. Ugh. Though I do get paid. The whole gang does. But now all the reprints of the book have those annoying, 'Now a Hit TV show on the WB Network!' stickers on them.</p>

<p>That's another reason I don't wanna go to this reunion. People'll come up to me and say, 'Aren't you that girl on that show?' or 'Can I have your autograph?' Yeah, he didn't want to make my character gay, so he made the Willow-like character, Maple, gay instead and put her with Tara-like character, Terri. He likes seeing my character in pain or something. But don't pay attention to that. What I told you is the truth. Real names, real places, the whole kit and caboodle. Feel privileged.</p>

<p>Willow and I are together. I don't know where I'd be if we weren't. </p>

<p>She's coming up to me. "Who are you talking to?" She asks, putting her arms around my neck.</p>

<p>"The readers. Say hi." You too.</p>

<p>"Hi!" She's waving.</p>

<p>"Do we have to go?" I frown.</p>

<p>"What about seeing all our friends from high school?"</p>

<p>"What friends?" I ask sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Come on, Buffy." She's close to begging. "We haven't been inside since they rebuilt it."</p>

<p>"There's no way I can get out of this?"</p>

<p>"Unless some evil thing pops up and -"</p>

<p>"Buffy, we may have a problem." Giles tells me from the table. Yes! "I've run out of bags for the customers." Damn.</p>

<p>Willow smiles at me. "I can't wait!"</p>

<p>Last ditch effort here. "If we stay home, I'll cook, we'll put in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and I'll give you a foot massage."</p>

<p>She's considering this. "Spaghetti in White Clam sauce?"</p>

<p>"Whatever you want." It's in the bag.</p>

<p>"Will you still do all that if we just go for forty-five minutes?"</p>

<p>I suppose I can compromise. "Forty-five minutes. I'll be watching the clock like a hawk."</p>

<p>She kisses me. I like it when she does that. "Thanks. And you'll...?"</p>

<p>"Wait on you hand and foot as soon as we get through the door? You bet."</p>

<p>Since we're kissing again, I think it's time for you to go. I know this is as unoriginal as it gets, but...</p>
