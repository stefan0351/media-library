<p><I>'Don't waste time, child.'</P>
<p></I>Willow heard the woman's voice in her head. Amid everything going through her right now, she didn't want to have to decipher this lady's cryptic advice. It was important, though. She could tell by the expression on her face. </P>
<p><I>'Focus, Willow. She still has time. I'll lend as much assistance as I can.'</P>
<p></I>What was she…God! CPR. Buffy had only been gone a few minutes. She set her friend's head down on the ground and kneeled over her chest. She was determined. </P>
<p>"Cordelia, apply pressure to her wound."</P>
<p>She wasn't sure what Willow had in mind, but she moved away from Xander and down to the wound in Buffy's stomach. Holding back any remarks, she looked around for something to use. Giles slipped his jacket off, and handed it to her. She tried to push as hard as she could to stop the bleeding. </P>
<P>Willow was about to tell him that she wanted to try CPR, but he didn't need to be told. He put his hands over Buffy's chest, and looked to Willow. She leaned down, and moved Buffy's lips open. Buffy was still warm. That was a good sign. Six breaths. One…two…three…four…</P>
<P>Giles followed up with six compressions on Buffy's chest. Willow repeated her breathing. "Come on, Buffy. Come back…"</P>
<p>"Someone should call an ambulance." Xander said, in obvious pain. Physical as well as emotional.</P>
<p>"They are already on their way." The woman said.</P>
<p>Willow glanced up at her quickly, and she and Giles kept repeating the process. Oz came in. Dressed. He just looked at everyone, and down at Willow trying desperately to resuscitate Buffy.</P>
<p>"Is the -" Giles started to ask.</P>
<p>"I heard sirens. They'll be here any second."</P>
<p>"How did you get clothes?" Xander asked, needing a distraction.</P>
<p>"Van. Lucky there's no one on the road at dawn."</P>
<p>"Angelus is gone, isn't he?"</P>
<p>"Could be dust."</P>
<p>"He's not." The woman said.</P>
<p>That's when Buffy started to breathe, but went into shock. There was a lot of blood loss. Willow started to panic.</P>
<p>"I don't know what to do!"</P>
<p>The wail of the ambulances was heard parked on the street. Two EMT's rushed into the mansion carrying a stretcher. They weren't sure why they were there at first, but then saw Buffy on the ground.</P>
<p>They both carefully lifted Buffy onto the stretcher.</P>
<p>"We need to get her to the hooked up to ventilator. How long has she been in shock?"</P>
<p>"About a minute." Willow answered.</P>
<p>"We need to hurry." They all started to follow the EMT's out, and Xander couldn't move. "Don't move. Two other guys are coming up with a stretcher for you." </P>
<p>He nodded.</P>
<p>Willow hopped in the back of the ambulance once they got Buffy situated. She grasped her hand. Buffy, although breathing and alive once more, had yet to open her eyes. They drove off.</P>
<p>Cordelia went with Xander in the second one, leaving Giles, the woman, and Oz behind.</P>
<p>"What's going on?" Giles asked her.</P>
<p>"She's missing something."</P>
<p>"You don't like explanations. I can tell." Oz said.</P>
<p>"Something Willow now has. Though she's not aware of it. Yet."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>In the ambulance, Willow was trying hard to mask her panic, and still gripped Buffy's hand tightly. The driver was talking on the radio to the receiver at the hospital, and the second man was in the back with them. Buffy's body had calmed somewhat.</P>
<p>"Summers, Buffy. Female. Eighteen years of age. Stomach wound. Massive blood loss. She's stable, but she'll need transfusions. We'll be there in two minutes."</P>
<p>"Why aren't her eyes opening?" Willow asked.</P>
<p>"She's weak from the loss of large amounts of blood. It's a miracle she's made it this far."</P>
<P>"But she should be doing…something!" Willow said raising her voice.</P>
<P>"I know you're upset, but I need you to calm down for me, okay? Can you tell me what happened?"</P>
<p>"She…I'm not sure. It happened really fast. Is she going to be okay?"</P>
<p>"They'll do everything they can for her. It would really help if we knew her blood type. The faster she gets blood, the better shot she'll have."</P>
<p>"Her mom would know. It never really came up before. I should call her -"</P>
<p>"The hospital already did." The paramedic put his hand on Willow's shoulder. "You gave her a fighting chance by reviving her as quickly as you did. She must really mean a lot to you."</P>
<p>"You have no idea." She said quietly.</P>
<P>The ambulance pulled into the ER entrance, and the mad rush began. As much as Willow wanted to stay with Buffy, she knew she had to let the doctors handle her now. She went inside to wait for everyone. Especially Buffy's mom.</P>

<hr width=100>

<I><P>Angelus. She could see his face. He was looking at her. Pure pleasure in his expression. She lowered her eyes, and saw the hot poker in his hands. He was getting ready to use it.</P>
<P>Looking across the room, she saw…herself? Where was Buffy? Unless…</P>
<P>He jammed the poker forward and it penetrated…</P>
<P>Everything sped up, and she shot across the room toward herself and entered…</P>
<P>'I'm with you, Willow.'</P>
</I><P>Willow shot forward, coming awake. Where was she? Buffy's bedside. Joyce was there, standing next to her chair. </P>
<P>"Willow, are you all right?" She asked.</P>
<P>"Yeah…bad dream. Did the doctor say anything?"</P>
<P>"She's stable, she…they don't know why she isn't responding. They said the operation went fine. She accepted the blood…" Joyce was speaking in a monotone voice, and her eyes were red.</P>
<P>"I'm sorry, Mrs. Summers."</P>
<P>Joyce kneeled down to face Willow. "You didn't do anything wrong. Don't blame yourself." She hugged her. "If it wasn't for you…"</P>
<P>Willow smiled weakly, and glanced up at the small window in the middle the door. Looking in, was the old woman.</P>
<P>"I need some fresh air. Will you -" Joyce nodded, and Willow stood, kissed Buffy softly, and left the room.</P>
<P>She went out in the hall. Oz was sitting in a chair against the wall, and the woman was gone.</P>
<P>"Hey." He said. "How's she doing?"</P>
<P>"Same. Where is everybody?"</P>
<P>"Giles went to get coffee, and Cordelia's still trying to get Xander to stay in his bed. Doctor doesn't want him aggravating his leg again. How are you?"</P>
<P>"How do I look?"</P>
<P>"Like you could use massive amounts of sleep."</P>
<P>"Just woke up from a nap in there." <I>'And I'm in no rush to do it again.' </I> "Did you see -"</P>
<P>She spotted the woman down the hall, and saw her turn to go into a room. Without a word, she followed her. The room had no occupant. Just an empty, freshly made bed, and a window, which the woman was standing by.</P>
<P>"You know."</P>
<P>"Know what? That Buffy's lying in a bed, not waking up, or moving at all? Yeah, I got that pretty clearly."</P>
<P>"And do you know why?"</P>
<P>"My brain's not really working that well right now, so could you just come out with it?"</P>
<P>"Have you asked yourself why you were healed and she wasn't?"</P>
<P>Willow thought back to her dream. Was it a dream? <I>'I'm with you, Willow.'</P>
</I><P>"She's in me," Willow said slowly.</P>
<P>"Very good. Although, more specifically, her essence. What some would call a soul. She saved you."</P>
<P>"How?"</P>
<P>"Your bond, Willow. Her desire to keep you safe was so strong, that at the moment you and she were going -"</P>
<P>"To die, her soul traveled into me, and kept me alive. Took away all my wounds…"</P>
<P>"More than that, my dear."</P>
<P>"What do you -"</P>
<P>Willow looked over at her right side, and saw a vampire standing there. Not stopping to wonder how or why it got there, on instinct, she charged it, knowing exactly what to do She did a high, jump kick, and connected with its head. It vanished.</P>
<P>"How'd I do that? How'd I know -"</P>
<P>"She's guiding you. Don't you see?"</P>
<P>Willow was speechless. Her shock passed, and she quickly began to worry. "But I'm not the Slayer. I can't…"</P>
<P>"Yes you can. But you are right. You aren't the Slayer, but you may have to be. For a time."</P>
<P>"How do I get her back?"</P>
<P>"She has to want to return. And it must happen before too much time passes."</P>
<P>"Or?"</P>
<P>"There is a delicate balance in all things, Willow, and by Buffy's soul inhabiting your body, that balance is disrupted. Buffy could be lost forever. Her body could stay in the coma-state indefinitely. And you…two souls in one body, could have consequences."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Willow didn't tell anybody about what she had learned. Saying you have someone's soul wasn't the kind of thing you just came out with. Especially because she felt responsible. Buffy gave up her soul to keep Willow going, and now she was lying prone in a hospital bed. Willow felt like a thief, although she knew she had nothing to do with it. </P>
<P>As she looked out the window in Buffy's room, the light from the full moon shined on her features. She was glad Oz was locked in the mausoleum. He had really taken it hard that he didn't remember to lock himself up the night before. Even though his wolfness really came in handy, and probably saved his and Giles' lives. </P>
<P>They had all just been so preoccupied, that a lot of things had slipped their minds. And now they were even more distracted. Seeing Buffy in this condition was hard for them, and she saw the looks of sympathy they gave her too.</P>
<P>Willow turned back to Buffy's bed, sat in the chair next to it, and grasped her hand. It was cold. She had sent Joyce home, who after a long "discussion" and some crying, she left reluctantly. She wanted to feel close to Buffy again, and even with her soul, she couldn't feel anything. </P>
<P>She felt her eyes start to droop. </P>

<hr width=100>

<P>She found herself standing in the middle of the graveyard. Knowing instinctively that it was a dream, she waited.  Then she felt something stirring in her.</P>
<P>"Willow?"</P>
<P>Buffy's voice. That was Buffy's voice…</P>
<P>"B…Buffy?"</P>
<P>"Are you okay, Will?"</P>
<P>"Where are you?"</P>
<P>"With you."</P>
<P>"With…"</P>
<P>Before she could finish, she felt something untangle inside her. A few moments later, Buffy was staring her in the face.</P>
<P>"See?"</P>
<P>Willow hugged her immediately, and noticed she had a light illuminating around her.</P>
<P>"You're glowing."</P>
<P>"So are you." Willow looked down at her hands, and saw that she was indeed glowing. "What's wrong?"</P>
<P>"What's wrong? You're…not…body…" Willow babbled.</P>
<P>"You're better aren't you?"</P>
<P>"Cuts and bruises wise. But…I need you."</P>
<P>"You have me."</P>
<P>"Not like this. You have things…you have to go back."</P>
<P>"I don't want to. It's safe with you. Nice."</P>
<P>"What about me…out there? Xander? Oz? Cordelia? Giles? We miss you. Your mom is really upset. What about her?"</P>
<P>Buffy's light began to dim as she frowned. "No. I won't…"</P>
<P>She vanished, leaving Willow standing alone. How was she going to do this? </P>
<P>A group of vampires suddenly appeared, encircling her. She assumed a fighting stance, when one of them approached her. Its face shifted, and took on the guise of Angelus.</P>
<P>"Can you handle it? I don't think you can. You're not Buffy. We'll destroy you, and her soul. And then the world."</P>
<P>Together, her and Buffy's voices mixed, coming out of her mouth as one. "No!"</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Sweat dripping down her forehead, she was startled as she felt a hand on her shoulder. She kicked up her leg, and jumped out of the chair. Giles was now on the floor, and she looked at him guiltily.</P>
<P>"What…are you doing here?" She asked.</P>
<P>"I came to tell you that visiting hours have been over for the past half hour. Xander came in earlier to tell you, but you were asleep, and he didn't want to wake you." He got up, and tried to regain his composure. "Where did you learn that?"</P>
<P>"I didn't. Well…kinda. I don't know."</P>
<P>"Willow?"</P>
<P>"There's things you need to know. Things I need to know."</P>
<P>"Such as?"</P>
<P>"Who's the Wicca lady? Oh, and how to slay."</P>
<P>Seeing his puzzled expression, she looked back at Buffy quickly, then led him out of the room. This was going to take awhile.</P>

<p>Buffy, well actually her soul, sat surrounded by light. She never wanted to leave. She was connected to Willow's soul, and felt completely safe and complete. She had no other care in the world. But she should of.</P>
<p>She felt like she was being pulled suddenly, and then everything disappeared into a tunnel of bright blue light. It went on for what seemed like forever, and then…stopped. </P>
<P>Finding herself at the bottom of a large set of steps, she started to look around. The stairs seemed to go on forever. Glancing behind her, she saw a faint, glowing cord. It was her connection to Willow's body. If it broke…</P>
<p>"I don't know what I'm doing here, but I'm not climbing all these stairs, so you can forget that right now."</P>
<p>(You have no physical body here, climbing is unnecessary)</P>
<p>"Then why have steps in the first place?"&#9;</P>
<P>Seeing she wasn't going to get an answer, Buffy allowed herself to float up the large number of stairs, and to a man whose back was turned. He was standing, facing two large double doors.</P>
<p>"Who are you?" The man turned, and Buffy went wide-eyed. "Angel?"</P>
<p>"We need to talk."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"This is a delicate situation. She is not prepared for this and we need to find a solution as fast as possible." Giles said, on the phone.</P>
<p>"We, Rupert? Miss Summers made her decision quite clear to Mr. Pryce. She wanted to severe ties with us, and she got her wish. She was warned against this, but she did not heed our advice. As far as we're concerned, she caused this through her own recklessness."</P>
<p>"But Willow is an innocent. Surely you can not expect her to -"</P>
<p>"It's a shame, but as long as the soul of the Slayer is bound to this world, the Council can do nothing. And if this young woman perishes doing Miss Summers' duty, it will be your charge's fault, not ours. Do not contact me any more on this matter."</P>
<p>The man on the other end hung up, as did Giles. Angry, he made his way up to the roof of his house, where Willow was training. He saw her kicking a makeshift dummy he had set up. She stopped as he walked closer.</P>
<p>"No luck?"</P>
<p>"No."</P>
<p>"Guess we should have figured as much, huh? So…what's next?"</P>
<p>He looked at her. She borrowed some of Buffy's workout clothes, and that was a good idea, because she was sweating like crazy. Plus, she was out of breath.</P>
<p>"Willow you don't have to -"</P>
<p>"Stop right there. I do, okay? The world needs a Slayer, and till we can get Buffy back…"</P>
<p>"Do you think she'd want you risking your life?"</P>
<p>"She risked her life to save me. And she might…disagree, but she's not here right now. So what's next?" He started to open his mouth again. "Do you want me to use my resolve face? I will, if that's what it takes."</P>
<p>"Fine. Then what's next, is class."</P>
<p>"Oh right. College. Can I though? I mean…"</P>
<p>"You cannot put your life on hold. It seems to me that Buffy is not only supplying her ability, but her personality as well."</P>
<p>Willow put her hands on her hips in a very "Buffy-like" stance.</P>
<p>"What's that supposed to mean?"</P>
<p>"Just an observation." He stuttered. "Cordelia's coming by to drive you to campus."</P>
<p>"Then I guess I should shower." Willow suddenly got a worried look on her face. "What if Buffy doesn't come back in time?"</P>
<p>"We'll get her back and we'll defeat Angelus, don't worry."</P>
<p>"Yeah that too, but what about college? She could fail!"</P>
<p>"One thing at a time, Willow. I know a lot of things have happened in the past couple days, but you need to focus."</P>
<p>"I know…I just miss her, and when she comes back I…thanks, Giles." She smiled at him, and made her way back inside.</P>
<p>Giles turned around, and faced the Wicca who had just seemed to appear.</P>
<p>"I have great respect for you, Watcher. You are exactly what she needs right now."</P>
<p>"As I have respect for you, but there are things she needs to know to survive. Things I cannot teach her. Are you going to tell her?"</P>
<p>"Yes, the time is right. I will watch over her tonight."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>Cordelia had decided to stay in Sunnydale to be with her friends. In her new used Honda Accord, Willow was trying to be nice and listen to her upset tirade. But it was hard to be supportive, when your life was falling slowly apart. </P>
<p>"I have to learn to haggle, you know? I mean I got a lot of money when I sold my convertible. A lot. But after paying the rent, and coming here, did I get another convertible? No. I got a stupid Honda."</P>
<p>"It's not a bad car."</P>
<p>"And the worst part is that I don't really own it. It's leased. Leased! And waitressing…" She looked over at Willow, and realized she wasn't paying much attention. She was staring out the window. Cordelia frowned to herself guiltily. "I'm sorry."</P>
<p>Willow looked over. "It's okay. Really."</P>
<p>"No it's not. I'm complaining about a stupid car, and you lost Buff -" Cordelia caught herself, and couldn't stand seeing that destroyed look on Willow's face. "I should just shut up, shouldn't I?"</P>
<p>"No…I…I feel lost. I just want her back. I don't know what to do anymore."</P>
<p>"She is with you though, right?"</P>
<p>"Kind of."</P>
<p>"Well she wouldn't steer you wrong. You know how she is. Stubborn. But the fact that she doesn't want to leave you, shows how much she loves you."</P>
<p>"Thanks, Cordy. For staying and everything. It's a big help."</P>
<p>Cordelia smiled. "I'm glad. And all she needs is someone to show her why she's needed out here."</P>

<hr width=100>

<p></P>
<p>"About?" Buffy asked him.</P>
<p>"You know."</P>
<p>She avoided him. "Where is this?"</P>
<p>"Souls cross over here. I asked to talk to you."</P>
<p>"Asked who?"</P>
<p>"I don't have much time. I can't help you fight any more. I can't go back into the world. But you can. And you need to."</P>
<p>"You brought me here."</P>
<p>"I mean to your body. The longer you stay with Willow, the more molded your souls become."</P>
<p>"What's wrong with that?"</P>
<p>"There's a balance in life Buffy. You're needed to help keep it that way. Willow too. But you're upsetting that balance by staying locked away. You like the comfort, right? No worries? No pain?</P>
<p>"But you're hurting Willow. And that's selfish."</P>
<p>"I saved her."</P>
<p>"For now. But he'll eventually regroup and come after her. Do you want to leave her with that responsibility? Your responsibility? Because if you do, she'll die."</P>
<p>"No…no she won't. Why are you hurting me like this?"</P>
<p>"I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you to see. Willow is as important to the cause as you are. A fighter. Which is why your joining together was meant to be.</P>
<p>"But she's confused now. Her skills aren't in the slaying area. Yours are. Together you're strong."</P>
<p>Buffy was quiet. Flashes hit her. <I>Holding Willow, kissing her, feeling her warmth, she missed her. Her friends. Her mother. Giles.</I> She hadn't realized it at first. Given the chance at escape, she had hid, and liked it. But she loved Willow, and didn't want to leave her to fight by herself. </P>
<p>"Okay, you've got my attention. But answer some things for me. Why Angelus?"</P>
<p>"They want to swing the balance in their favor again. Since the Mayor's death, Good has gotten a couple steps ahead of Evil. He kept a tight reign on things. Now it's fallen apart. Angelus' drive to take you out got him elected for the job."</P>
<p>"But Angelus is just a vampire. He can't -"</P>
<p>"He's a vampire who's very good at what he does. As far as the other side is concerned, he's been successful. To them you and Willow are dead."</P>
<p>"I guess technically we were, but what does that mean? What are they gonna do?"</P>
<p>"You have to go, and so do I."</P>
<p>"No, wait…" Everything vanished, and she was beside Willow's soul again. "Okay…so how do I get back?"</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>The sun was going to be down in five minutes. At least she was early for her new job. The cemetery wasn't so bad when the sun was out, but she could feel the vampires waiting to rise. It was unnerving. She didn't know how Buffy could handle it.</P>
<p>"Who am I kidding? I should just offer my neck to a vampire right now and get it over with."</P>
<p>"Do you really think that is a wise choice?" The Wicca lady said from behind her.</P>
<p>She whirled around, her newly acquired reflexes responding quickly.</P>
<p>"You!" Willow crossed her arms over her chest. "I've had enough of this 'popping up everywhere' act. I'm jumpy, and I can't handle it anymore. Who are you?"</P>
<p>"Search my eyes."</P>
<p>Willow locked eyes with the woman, and with the words she wasn't sure were her own, spoke. "Listen to the words of the Great Mother, who of old was called Artemis, Astarte, Demeter, Melusine, Aphrodite, Cerridwen, Diana, Arianhod, Brigid, Hectate, Isis, and the many other names.</P>
<p>"I am the beauty of the Green earth and the White moon, and the Mysteries of the waters. From me all things proceed and unto Me they must return. Let My worship be in the heart that rejoices, for all acts of love and pleasure are My rituals. </P>
<P>"Let there be beauty and strength, power and compassion, mirth and reverence, within you. And you who seek to know Me, know that your seeking and yearning will avail you not, unless you know the Mystery : </P>
<P>"If that which you seek, you find not within yourself, you will never find it without. For behold, I have been with you from the beginning, and I am that which is attained at the end of desire."</P>
<P>"Your Wiccan instincts do not fail you."</P>
<P>"The Goddess?" She nodded. "I would've thought…you'd look a little less…old."</P>
<P>"Well, that has to be the most interesting reaction I've ever received."</P>
<P>"Oh…I'm sorry…I…yelled…and you're all powerful…"</P>
<P>"I am only as powerful as Fate would dictate."</P>
<P>"You like talking about Fate a lot."</P>
<P>"Fate is simply the force that directs life. I am allowed status only if I do not abuse my gifts. That would make me no better then a demon. I choose this guise to follow the path of nature. And aging is a natural process."</P>
<P>"Okay, I understand, but why me?"</P>
<P>"Because you are Fate's chosen. Alongside the Slayer your magical ability is strong and surpasses any before you."</P>
<P>"But I'm…"</P>
<P>"Your self-doubt holds you back. You've always been special. You've always been meant to do this."</P>
<P>"But if I'm supposed fight alongside Buffy, why this?"</P>
<P>"Fate isn't perfect, Willow. It does its best to put you on the right path, but sometimes it misses the mark. But if something is meant to be, there are other chances along the way.</P>
<P>"Think of this as a test. I was picked to be your guide, and I will help you harness your talent."</P>
<P>"Wow, being trained by the Goddess."</P>
<P>"I believe it's time for your first obstacle."</P>
<P>As soon as the Goddess said that, Willow sensed the vampire behind her. She could feel Buffy. Like she was telling her what to do. Letting herself go, she brought her forearm up, and smashed the vampire in the face. </P>

<hr width=100>

<p>"You can do it, Will." Buffy said quietly.</P>

<hr width=100>

<p>The vampire stumbled backwards, surprised. Willow took the stake from her pocket, and waited for it to charge. It did, and she sidestepped it, kicking it in the back of the knees. It hit the ground hard.</P>
<p>"Trying to overpower him physically is not the only way to fight him." The Goddess said.</P>
<p>Willow ran over to the fallen vampire and grabbed him by the jacket. "What do you mean?"</P>
<p>"Your true ability lies in magick. Use it."</P>
<p>In the midst of pulling the vampire up, Willow loosened her grip when he growled, surprised. He hit her in the face and she landed on her back.</P>
<p>"I really can't remember a spell right now." The vampire stood over her.</P>
<p>"Magick isn't all spells. It's inside you. Reach deep within yourself."</P>
<p>Willow kicked up her leg, hitting the vampire in the groin, and tossing him up over her head. She heard a crack as he hit a gravestone, and jumped up into a fighting stance. She concentrated her thoughts as he charged.</P>
<p>Before he could reach her, a force knocked him back a few feet, but he was able to catch himself. Trying again, he reached her, and took a swipe. He recoiled his hand in pain, and shock when he didn't strike her. Something had blocked him.</P>
<p>Willow jammed the stake out with amazing speed, and dusted him.</P>
<p>"Well done." She saw Willow's arm droop. "Tired?"</P>
<p>"Uh huh."</P>
<p>"With practice it'll become easier. And that's what I'm here for. There's a reason why Buffy is the Slayer and you have a gift for magick. While her gift may be beneficial, you have to hone your skill. </P>
<P>"Your body is not used to the physical strain of battling demons. So turn to that as a last resort. One demon is enough for tonight. We will work tomorrow."</P>
<P>"What about Buffy?"</P>
<P>"She is ready to return. We just have to find the means with which to return her. And the sooner the better."</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Under the streets, in a sewer tunnel, Angelus sat against a wall. His body was still riddled with bullets. He could barely move. A black cloaked figure appeared in front of him.</P>
<P>"You people aren't very original. Black cloaks?"</P>
<P>"We're not concerned originality, demon. And for someone in your position, it is not a time for such wasteful things as sarcasm. You almost sound human."</P>
<P>Angelus growled angrily as his face shifted, showing his demonic side. "What do you want?"</P>
<P>"Sitting here in a sewer is not getting much accomplished."</P>
<P>"Well, I happen to be somewhat incapacitated. Funny thing about demons. They could care less about one of their own. Especially one who's injured."</P>
<P>"What is your point, Angelus?"</P>
<P>"I can't get these damn bullets out, and it hurts like hell."</P>
<P>"Is that the only problem?" The cloaked figure raised his hands, and the bullets ripped from Angelus' body. He screamed, in a mixture of pain and growling. "Listen closely. Do the job we released you for or we take you back as easily as we let you go. You're turning out to be less than we'd hoped."</P>
<P>"What the hell are you talking about? I killed them."</P>
<P>"Really? Their souls are stronger, and still in this reality. You failed."</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>"Prove your worth. Opening the Mouth of Hell will be less risky with the two Warriors of Light destroyed, but if they're not, you must open the Mouth regardless. We've waited, and our time is near."</P>
<P>"I'll get it done."</P>
<P>The cloaked figure vanished. It was time to get his act back together, and find out what the hell had been going on.</P>

<hr width=100>

<P>Willow sat by Buffy's bedside, holding her hand.</P>
<P>"You would have been proud me. I kicked serious demon ass. Bet you want to get back to it too now, huh? Well will get you back. Don't worry.</P>
<P>"Then were gonna have a lot of missed time together to make up for." Willow smiled.</P>
<I><P>'Can't wait.'</P>
</I><P>Willow wasn't sure, but she thought she heard Buffy. Kissing her forehead, she left the hospital with a smile on her face. She felt better then she had in awhile. Things were looking up.</P>

<p>Three vampires at once, was a daunting task. Well, to Willow anyway. She had gotten stronger magick wise and more adept at slaying over the past two weeks. She wouldn't say that battling vampires was a walk in the park now, but it was definitely easier. Still, when they attacked in a pack, it got tricky.</p>
<p>She knew the Goddess was watching. The woman had tried to keep her distance, slowly trying to build up Willow's confidence in herself and to teach her self-reliance. And Willow was learning. Even how to pun too.</p>
<p>She looked at the three vampires around her. &#34;Do I have to shoot a starter pistol or wave a checkered flag? Let's go!&#34; That was one of her better ones.</p>
<p>They obliged her. Two ran around behind her, and one charged from the front. </p>
<p>'Concentrate.' She thought quietly.</p>
<p>She round-housed the one in front of her, while at the same time, moving a fallen branch off the ground. Waiting to see where he landed, she then thrust the branch into his chest. He turned to dust.</p>
<p>The two behind her each grabbed one of her arms and held her. This was the tricky part. As she was trying to figure out what to do, she felt a pain in her stomach. </p>
<p>The pains had been coming fairly regularly recently, and just when she thought she had gotten rid of them, they came back stronger. And so were the vampires grips.</p>
<p>Mentally telling her body to knock it off, she propelled herself, using all her strength, over and behind her two captors. When she finished the backflip, the vampires were stunned. Using that, she got Mr. Pointy from her jacket, and using the old fashioned method, staked one in the back. She grabbed the other by his shirt collar, and reached her arm around to his heart area, and finished the job.</p>
<p>Taking a breath, Willow started to walk. &#34;They seem more focused lately. Wonder why.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'm not one to take all the credit,&#34; Angelus said walking towards her from the street, &#34;but I have to be honest. It was me.&#34;</p>
<p>'Don't freak out, Willow.' &#34;Doesn't look like you've done a very good job.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Oh they're still idiots, but like you said, they're focused. But enough about me. You seem to have gotten a little more interesting since I've been gone. Now it's my turn to ask why.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Steroids.&#34; Willow deadpanned through her fear.</p>
<p>&#34;Where's Buffy, Willow? I've been watching you for awhile. Never any Buffy. In fact, I can't seem to find her at all.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And it's gonna stay that way.&#34; She felt the pains begin again.</p>
<p>Time was running, and he didn't have time to beat around the bush. </p>
<p>&#34;I still can't figure out how you didn't die.&#34; His face shifted, his yellow eyes locked on hers. &#34;And right after I beat what I want out of that pretty, red head of yours, I'll correct my mistake.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Across the ocean, a secluded complex sat in the English countryside. Inside the series of connected buildings, everything seemed normal. People were going about their business. Potential watchers not assigned to Slayers trained, studied, and some just did paperwork.</p>
<p>But there was an underlying tension that enveloped everyone. Ever since the active slayer, Buffy Summers, had removed herself from the Council, they had been waiting for the inevitable dissolution of their institution. If they weren't connected to the Slayer, there was no need for them to exist.</p>
<p>There had been suicides. Demons they held captive for study purposes had picked up on the fact that things were falling apart, and had risked escape. People had died. Of course, nobody spoke of the occurrences. It wasn't good policy. The Council ran a tight ship. Or tried to.</p>
<p>They all knew that with Buffy's calling, things were going to change, they just hadn't anticipated how much. She had friends, a life, and a mother who knew about her destiny. Slayers weren't supposed to have those things. </p>
<p>They lost one of their most respected watchers. Rupert Giles had been very respected. But some, basing it on his rebellious past, had suspected that he would follow his darker tendencies, and turn against his employers. The loss was still great, however. And a shame.</p>
<p>In the extensive occult library on the grounds, one man was searching volumes furiously. A man who knew all about the 'Buffy situation', and had experienced it first-hand. Wesley Wyndam Pryce was one of the youngest watchers enlisted in the Council's ranks, very promising, and to some, the most impressionable.</p>
<p>He had left Sunnydale months before, his views, the rules he lived by, shaken. When he first met Buffy and her friends he couldn't figure out how a Slayer, a misguided ex-watcher, and a few civilians had managed to last three years. One would have expected them to last at the very least, three months. He soon found out why.</p>
<p>Emotional attachment, he had figured out, was the reason for their survival. And that was surprising, because that was one of the main things the Council frowned upon. But emotional attachment gave those people reasons to fight. To keep each other alive.</p>
<p>And they were efficient, and creative. He had tried to keep control, but at the time he hadn't realized that it was already under control. Just not the kind he was used to. Terrible things had happened to them, things that could have destroyed them, and not just physically. Yet they were still strong and together.</p>
<p>They were the balance between the Earth and its destruction, and he knew now, but the rest of the Council chose to ignore it, that the mixed group in Sunnydale was necessary and nobody could do any better. And now that the situation had taken a turn for the worse over there, he had to do something. Had to help.</p>
<p>In the library, he was sure the Council had the book that held the right spell, the right instructions, to restore Buffy's soul back to her. And the quicker he found it, the better. As necessary as Willow was to the cause, and important as she and Buffy were to each other, a Slayer's soul belonged in the body it was born to. No one else.</p>
<p>But if he was reading the spell correctly, he was only half-right.</p>
<p>&#34;What are you researching?&#34; A man walked up to the table Wesley was sitting at.</p>
<p>&#34;Mr..Mr. Travers. Just for my personal knowledge. Can't be too informed.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Quite.&#34; Quentin Travers looked down at the book, and began to read. &#34;I hope you're not planning on sharing this with anyone.&#34;</p>
<p>'Stand up to him, Wesley.' &#34;We have the information they need. Why not give it -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Because they chose to leave us. You know the policy.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I hardly think the policy applies anymore. We're losing our status. Besides, and correct if I'm wrong, we were created to rid the world of evil creatures, and they've done that better than any single slayer in history. We cannot let them -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;If she dies, we can summon the next slayer. Then we will regain control.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You and I both know that something big is approaching,&#34; Wesley stood from his chair, and looked Quentin in the eyes, &#34;and any slayer we activate will not be prepared for the battle.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What did they do to you?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Nothing. Sir. I just went out in the world. You should try it sometime.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I could have you fired, you know.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I suppose you could.&#34;</p>
<p>Quentin picked up the book off the table, and placed it in Wesley's hands.</p>
<p>&#34;But I won't.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;If you want to help, why -?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I have some power, some influence, but we all answer to someone. Now go. And good luck.&#34;</p>
<p>Wesley looked at him, and then they both turned and saw another man approaching. A man he recognized as a fellow watcher. When Wesley turned back, Quentin was gone.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Willow and Angelus approached each other cautiously, both assuming battle stance. She was scared out of her mind. Slayer abilities or no, this was Angelus. The man who had inflicted hours of torture on her while she was chained against a wall. But she couldn't let him see that, or he'd use it to his advantage.</p>
<p>He snarled, and threw a punch, which she avoided. She kneed him in the chest, and magickly threw him backward onto the ground.</p>
<p>&#34;Hiding behind spells. I never pegged you as a cheater.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Being moral is at the bottom of my list right now. And like you wouldn't cheat if you got the chance.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You know me too well.&#34; He lunged at her, tackling her to the ground. She tried rolling, but it didn't work. His body weight kept her firmly beneath him, and her brought his arm down towards her head. &#34;Tell me what I want to know, or I start crushing.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You'll do it whether I tell you or not.&#34;</p>
<p>He brought his hand closer, and leaned down closer, and she was starting to find breathing difficult. Then he started to smoke, and recoiled, jumping off her. She flipped back up into a fighting stance, and showed him the cross around her neck.</p>
<p>&#34;Bitch.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Thanks.&#34; She grabbed her stomach. Why wouldn't the pain stop?</p>
<p>Angelus was enraged now. This was Willow. So what if she had some slaying ability, and a little magick? Still, there was something strong about her, and something making her weak at the same time. He couldn't figure it out. </p>
<p>He was about to use Willow's temporary pain, to kick her head in, when the Goddess appeared between them, facing Willow.</p>
<p>&#34;Let's go, child.&#34; </p>
<p>&#34;This isn't your business, witch.&#34; Angelus said to her.</p>
<p>She turned around. &#34;I'm not stopping you.&#34; Not having learned his lesson from last time, he tried to attack her. Without lifting a finger, the Goddess' mere essence caused him pain. She turned back to Willow. &#34;It's time to leave.&#34;</p>
<p>They walked away, and Angelus stared after them, and then disappeared into the shadows.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;That was close. Thanks.&#34; Willow said to the Goddess when they were far enough away.</p>
<p>&#34;I will not always be there to help. Or be able to.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow nodded. &#34;I.Buffy and I will get him.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Keep that determination. You'll need it. It seems the pain is getting worse.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'm a little scared. What's happening to me?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What do you think is happening?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I don't know. It probably has something to do with.Buffy's soul?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Most likely.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Most likely?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It is not my body. You have to discover the problem for yourself.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Well I just can't talk to my soul. It's not something you talk to. 'Hey soul, how are you? Keeping my girlfriend company?'&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Not in the conventional way. You're soul, Buffy's soul, is a part of you. You can communicate with it. Not many people know how, but you have the ability. Most times it happens involuntarily through dreams. Although it doesn't have to happen that way.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Oh.okay. Well.um.I have to go see her.&#34;</p>
<p>She visited Buffy after every patrol. It was a ritual. &#34;Be careful.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I know. Will you be at Giles'?&#34;</p>
<p>The Goddess had vanished. Willow should've gotten used to that by now, but it still freaked her out a little. She glanced over her shoulder, and made her way to the hospital.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Cordelia, Xander, and Oz sat in Giles' house, reading. They had been trying to find anything to put Buffy back where she was supposed to be, but so far, there was nothing at all. They were starting to get worried.</p>
<p>On the plus side, Xander was back to full strength. His legs had healed, and his bones had set rather quickly. Quicker than expected by normal medical standards, anyway. They all figured that it had to do with the Goddess' presence in their lives every day.</p>
<p>She hadn't healed him directly, but when she was around, things seemed to flourish, and the air was charged with feelings. Feelings of goodness, healing - positive things. Of course Xander hadn't thought that deeply. He was just glad that his legs were in working condition again.</p>
<p>&#34;Who else is frustrated?&#34; Cordelia asked. The three other people raised their hands.</p>
<p>&#34;These books could use simplification.&#34; Oz said.</p>
<p>&#34;Somehow I don't think that would help.&#34; Giles said.</p>
<p>&#34;What are you saying?&#34; Xander asked, already knowing the answer.</p>
<p>Giles took his glasses off, and rubbed his eyes. &#34;That none of these books may hold the answer.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Well, what about the Goddess person? Who by the way, could use massive amounts of plastic surgery.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;She chooses that guise.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Well that's the worst choice in the history of choices. So back to my question. what about her? She's gotta know something.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;If she did, I think she would have given a clue as to where to look, but she hasn't. We cannot rely on her for everything. We're lucky she's aiding us at all.&#34;</p>
<p>Cordelia flinched slightly at his tone. &#34;Somebody needs a pill.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'm sorry, Cordelia. I'm just -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Exhausted. Like the rest of us.&#34; Xander finished.</p>
<p>&#34;Call it a night?&#34; Oz asked, although it was more like a statement.</p>
<p>&#34;Yes, you three should. I have to wait for Willow to return.&#34; They all hesitated. &#34;Go. I'll call each of you when she gets back.&#34;</p>
<p>They waited another second, and went out the door. Giles turned around, and came face to face with the Goddess.</p>
<p>&#34;You should rest.&#34; She said.</p>
<p>&#34;Eventually I'll get around to it. Is she all right?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;For now. When she returns she'll have things to tell you. Things are.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Things are what?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Progressing. On both sides. Someone carries the answer to restoring Buffy to her rightful place, but there are difficult times ahead.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;When are there not?&#34;</p>
<p>The Goddess smiled briefly, and disappeared as quickly as she had come.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Angelus followed Willow as she walked. Seeing no sign of the Goddess, he was glad. More than he would admit to himself. He was evil, sure. But he wasn't strong enough, powerful enough, to match the goodness, and the light that emanated from the old witch. So he had no choice when he succumbed to her. </p>
<p>But it was still embarrassing.</p>
<p>He followed Willow every night, but somehow after awhile, she had managed to elude him. Fighting her tonight, he came to the conclusion that it probably had something to do with magick. A trick so she was invisible to him or something. He always despised spells. Well, only when it was used against him.</p>
<p>He noticed that she always passed by the hospital. She would walk the next block down, turn onto the next street, and that's when he'd lose her. Tonight as she turned down that street, he hung back, and waited across the street from the hospital.</p>
<p>Sure enough, a couple minutes later, Willow jogged to the hospital entrance. </p>
<p>'So.Buffy's out of commission. Clever, Willow.'</p>
<p>He started to walk over to the hospital, and then stopped, cursing under his breath. He could smell the sun coming. Frustrated, but feeling better, he stalked off. He'd be back. After all it was good manners to pay respects to sick. He was practically family, after all.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Willow entered Buffy's room. The nurses had stopped trying to deny her access. It wasn't worth the effort. She saw Joyce asleep in a chair, by the bed. Willow smiled sadly. She didn't know who missed Buffy more. Her or Joyce. </p>
<p>Not wanting to wake her, Willow walked around to the other side of the bed. There were no more chairs, so she knelt on the floor, and grasped Buffy's hand.</p>
<p>&#34;I.kinda need to talk to you. Big patrol tonight. Finally ran into Angelus. That was a big, not very fun thing. We're close to getting you back. I can feel it. So, I'm gonna try something.&#34;</p>
<p>'The Goddess said I could talk with my soul. I just have to close my eyes, and concentrate.'</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>She closed her eyes, thought about Buffy, envisioned her inner self, and took deep breaths. After a few seconds, she wasn't aware of the hospital anymore, and the next thing she saw was her dorm room. Their dorm room.</p>
<p>&#34;Willow?&#34; </p>
<p>That was Buffy's voice. Willow looked around to Buffy's bed, and saw her soul and Buffy's sitting on it, joined together. &#34;Buffy?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You're here.&#34; They both said at the same time.</p>
<p>Willow went over to her, and they embraced.</p>
<p>&#34;And here I thought.&#34; Buffy trailed off when she felt the tug of her soul partner. </p>
<p>&#34;What's wrong?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Soul You has been a little more active lately. I've been fighting it, but I don't know how long I can last.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Until what?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'm not sure, but I think it has something to do with permanent melding.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;That's probably what.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Nothing. I'm gonna get you back in your body, don't worry.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;If you tell me not to, I won't. You been okay?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;So far. You?&#34; Not exactly sure what to say.</p>
<p>&#34;Gets lonely.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Even with -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;This,&#34; Buffy said looking over at Soul Willow, &#34;is just a part of you. I want the whole package.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Big agreeing ditto from me. I miss you.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Same here, Will. Come 'ere.&#34; They hugged again.</p>
<p>Willow looked over at her soul. &#34;And you behave. Don't fight with her. You'll hurt both of us.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;But.I want her to stay.&#34; Her voice echoed back at her.</p>
<p>&#34;You know where she belongs.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;In your arms? Physical arms, I mean.&#34; Buffy smirked. Well, as much as she could in her current state.</p>
<p>&#34;I like the sound of that.&#34; Willow felt herself, her body, calling her back to the world.</p>
<p>&#34;I know you have to go.just hurry, okay?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Count on it. Love you.&#34;</p>
<p>She heard Buffy echo her words as everything disappeared.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;Willow? Willow, are you all right?&#34; </p>
<p>It was Joyce. She was leaning over her, and Willow realized she had been lying on the floor of the room. She knew what she had just experienced had happened, but every time she did something mystical and metaphysical, she was always questioning if it was real or a dream.</p>
<p>She realized she hadn't answered Joyce. &#34;Yeah, Mrs. Summers. I'm fine.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I woke up and you were laying on the floor. I tried to wake you, but you wouldn't, and I was just about to get a nurse -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'm fine, really.&#34; Joyce had been through a lot lately, and Willow saw how worried she looked. She embraced her.</p>
<p>&#34;I was so scared. If something happened to you.Buffy wouldn't have a reason to come back.&#34; Joyce took a deep breath. &#34;That sounded horrible.I'm sorry.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Don't be. I know what you meant. Did you get much sleep?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Enough. Come on.I'll give you a ride to Mr. Giles' house.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Okay.&#34; Willow put her hand in Joyce's. &#34;Soon. I promise.&#34;</p>
<p>Joyce smiled at her, and they walked out of the room.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Around noon the next day, they were all in Giles' house, and Willow had filled them in on everything that had happened. They all were a little more hopeful, because it meant Buffy was really there. With Willow. It was something to help them keep going.</p>
<p>There was a knock on the door, and Giles went to answer it. They all looked as he opened it.</p>
<p>&#34;Hello everyone.&#34; Wesley said, as they stared at him.</p>

<p>&#34;Wesley. What brings you here?&#34; Giles asked.</p>
<p>Willow studied his face. She walked up to him. &#34;You have something, don't you? Something to bring her back.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Possibly, yes.&#34; He pulled a large book out of his bag, and opened it up. He handed it to Giles.</p>
<p>&#34;Not to sound, ungrateful, but why are you here?&#34; Xander asked.</p>
<p>&#34;As in, why are you helping us?&#34; Cordelia asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Valid questions. The Council's in a less than stable state at the moment -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Someone wants to get a Slayer back into their employment. Anyone else sense a bribe?&#34; Xander asked.</p>
<p>Oz raised his hand in answer.</p>
<p>Giles studied the book, and shook his head. &#34;Once the Council hands down their decision, they don't go back on it. No matter what the circumstances.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Quite correct, and as I was about to say, I came here because I've been aware of what happened to Buffy, and I want to see her well again.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;They let you leave?&#34; Giles asked, astonished.</p>
<p>&#34;It surprised me as well. There seems something off about the Council now. Quentin seemed strangely.unraveled. I believe something rather big to be coming.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yes there must be, if the Council has let you leak information.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I don't mean to sound rude, but right now the Council really doesn't matter to me. What is this book, and how can it help Buffy?&#34; Willow asked, impatiently.</p>
<p>&#34;Sorry.&#34; Wesley said. &#34;Ah, this is the hand-written journal and spell book of Jonas Barton. He was a self-proclaimed warlock in the Middle Ages. It's true that most of the reported magick done during that time period was a hoax, but this man 's talent was genuine.</p>
<p>&#34;He didn't advertise his services. In fact he was very much into isolation. However, he did extensive research and experimentation on soul existence. Soul mates, and the like. He was very adept at it.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Kinda strange that a guy into isolation, would be interested in soul mates.&#34; Oz said.</p>
<p>&#34;There are sketchy reports that even though he had a magickal ability for most of his life, the reason for his sudden interest in the subject was that he had lost his wife to a murderer, and he was afraid that she was not at rest in the afterlife.&#34; They stared at him. &#34;Which is a story for another time. Anyhow, he refined his spells, and his learnings, into this book. Before he passed on, he donated it to the Council.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;That's great, but what spell -&#34;</p>
<p>Giles pointed it out to Willow, and began to read Jonas' writing.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;This is your last chance to eliminate the obstacles that are a threat to our coming. A threat to the opening of the gateway below your feet.&#34; The cloaked figure said.</p>
<p>&#34;Your point?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Whether or not you succeed, your energies must be refocused on preparing for my return. Completely. If the two light warriors are still breathing when I walk on this ground fully once more, they will be the first to die.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;They're my kill.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;We'll see. Focus, Angelus. I hope you're successful tonight, then you'll have fewer distractions later.&#34;</p>
<p>The figure vanished, and Angelus sat in the Master's old chair. There were eight hours until sundown.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>They read over, more like scrutinized, the spell again and again. Willow mostly, because she was the one who had to recite it. It seemed simple, but she wasn't taking any chances.</p>
<p>Joyce had come to the house. She was basically a bystander, leaving her daughter's well being in her friends' hands, and out of hers. She wished she could've been more helpful, but Buffy's condition had to do with something she barely understood. But Willow was in control, and she cared about and loved Buffy as much as Joyce did. She would get Buffy back.</p>
<p>&#34;Read it to me. Again?&#34; Willow asked Giles.</p>
<p>&#34; 'This must be performed in a completely positively charged environment. No negative emotions whatsoever, no hate, anger, they all must be cleared in order for this to work. The person's soul mate must be the one to carry it out, whether he or she is magickally versed or not. They must also be alone. No outsiders.</p>
<p>&#34; 'Physical contact is necessary for the transference, as well as an open heart. This may sound less like magick and more like poetry, but in all my studies, I find that the soul creates its own magick, and we follow what it tells us. It is connected to every part of us, but for those special cases, the souls that are so joined together that they belong as one, but reside in two bodies, they sometimes get confused. So we must help them return to where they belong. The following words -' &#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'm sorry, but can I mention something?&#34; Joyce asked. They all nodded. &#34;Buffy is in a hospital. The doctors won't let us take her home, so it would be.difficult to perform this without interruptions.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I hadn't thought of that.&#34; Giles said.</p>
<p>&#34;Speaking of things we haven't thought of, what about Angelus?&#34; Xander brought up.</p>
<p>&#34;When you do the spell, Angelus won't interfere.&#34; The Goddess said, appearing in the room. &#34;But after this point, direct contact won't be allowed. You're on the right path, Willow, and I can't take you much further. You will learn much in the near future, and with Buffy at your side, you will go far.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow walked up to her. &#34;Will I see you again?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'll be around. Good luck to you.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Thank you.&#34;</p>
<p>But the Goddess was already gone.</p>
<p>&#34;Best entrances and exits I've ever seen.&#34; Oz said.</p>
<p>&#34;We will worry about the hospital later. The sooner we do this the better for everyone. For the world.&#34; Wesley said.</p>
<p>&#34;Tonight.&#34; Willow said, and closed her eyes fighting off the pain. Her soul wanted to keep Buffy bad. Not that she could blame it.</p>
<p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; Cordelia asked.</p>
<p>&#34;I will be. Giles, can you finish reading?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Of course.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>At sundown, Angelus made his way to the hospital. He had one thing on his mind. No more games, no more scheming, nothing else except finishing off his ex once and for all.</p>
<p>So what if Willow had slaying ability? He didn't care. It was somehow connected to Buffy, and he figured if he got rid of her, Willow wouldn't be far behind. It would be simple. And it would have to be quick, because he had bigger obligations. Buffy and Willow were insignificant next to the larger plan.</p>
<p>Whether he believed that or not, it wasn't up to him to make the decisions. He had orders, and he hated following them, but that was the only way he'd get to stay among the human populated world. And get his power later on.</p>
<p>He entered through the automatic doors, and went to the front desk.</p>
<p>&#34;Can I help you?&#34; A woman asked, sitting beside a computer.</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy Summers room.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Friend or family?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Killer.&#34; He said under his breath.</p>
<p>&#34;Excuse me?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Close friend of the family.&#34;</p>
<p>The lady was wary, but seeing look in his eyes, she also didn't want to object.</p>
<p>&#34;Third floor. Room 308.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Xander and Oz returned to Giles' house after buying supplies at the magick shop. Willow was talking with Wesley and Giles, and Joyce was on the phone. Cordelia was simply offering silent moral support.</p>
<p>Willow saw them, and walked over. &#34;You get the stuff?&#34;</p>
<p>Oz nodded.</p>
<p>&#34;Yep. One bag of pixie dust and a bottle of Love Potion Number Nine.&#34; Xander joked.</p>
<p>&#34;Xander.&#34; She said forcefully.</p>
<p>&#34;Sorry. Don't worry. We got everything.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No,&#34; Willow grabbed her head, and took an exhausted breath, &#34;I'm sorry. It's just.I'm on edge, you know? This is the only option we've got, and if it doesn't work.&#34;</p>
<p>Xander put his hand on her shoulder. &#34;It'll work.It'll work.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Make me believe that. Please.&#34;</p>
<p>Oz took his turn. &#34;If anyone can do it, Will.it's you. She'll come back because you want her to. The spell stuff is just a helper, but if you want her to come back, she will. Want something badly enough, and you'll get it.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I gotta tell you, Oz, when you decide to say more than a word, its strangely moving.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'm full of surprises.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow chuckled a little. &#34;Thanks, guys. You're right. Just have to use my resolve face.&#34;</p>
<p>Joyce just got off the phone, and went over to Willow, Xander, and Oz.</p>
<p>&#34;It took some pushing, but using the mother card, I got them to move her to a more secluded wing on the hospital. It's older, but they'll be fewer people around, and it'll be pretty much isolated.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What about Angelus?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Oh, I gave them his description. They won't let him go near her.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And they'll stop him, how?&#34; Cordelia asked, coming out of her silent state.</p>
<p>&#34;We go now.&#34; Willow stated, and Giles grabbed a bag of slaying tools off the table.</p>
<p>They were out the door immediately, no objections or questioning. This was Willow's plan, her rules. It was time to get Buffy back.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Angelus walked into Room 308, intent on his task, only to find it empty. He found it hard to keep his temper. He walked along the hallway, until he saw what he assumed was a doctor. He stopped him.</p>
<p>&#34;What happened to the girl in that room?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Blond-haired girl? Coma?&#34; The doctor asked.</p>
<p>&#34;That's her.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;She was moved to another area of the hospital.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Why?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Her mother asked us to, and as we saw no harm in it -&#34;</p>
<p>'Joyce. Who would've thought you had any intelligence?'</p>
<p>Angelus grabbed the doctor by his shirt, and held back a snarl. &#34;Where is she?&#34;</p>
<p>He looked the man over who was holding him more carefully, and knew from description and his current predicament, that this man was dangerous.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm sorry. I can't reveal that.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Listen to me. I can do one of two things. If you tell me, I let you go. If you don't, I can kill you and tear this building apart until I find her. Your choice.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I won't.&#34; The doctor squeaked out, still trying to appear unfazed. Plus he figured that this was a hospital. With potential witnesses. The man had to be bluffing. But he was wrong.</p>
<p>&#34;Don't you know the brave ones are always the first to go?&#34; He snapped the doctor's neck, and threw him to the ground.</p>
<p>&#34;Security to the third floor. Security to the -&#34; A nurse said into an intercom on the wall.</p>
<p>Angelus rushed over to the woman, and knocked her to the floor. Tears were forming in her eyes. &#34;I know you're not as foolish as the doctor. Are you?&#34;</p>
<p>The woman didn't move or speak.</p>
<p>&#34;Tell me what I want to know.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;She wasn't on my rounds, I don't -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Wrong answer.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Wait!&#34; She said frantically. &#34;I can find out.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Better answer.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Everyone got to the hospital, and went to the wing on the lower level where they said Buffy was moved. They were all pretty much regulars, so the staff recognized them, and didn't bother them. But one of the women at the reception desk saw where they were headed, and ran to them hurriedly this time.</p>
<p>&#34;Are you going to see Miss Summers?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yes. Is something wrong?&#34; Giles asked.</p>
<p>&#34;It's not safe. There's this crazed man, and the guards have -&#34;</p>
<p>They ran past the woman, ignoring her warnings.</p>
<p>&#34;He isn't going to take her from me.he isn't going to take her from me.&#34; Willow kept repeating to herself.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>He stood in Buffy's room. Seeing the machines, the tubes, the wires.he was getting a rush of pleasure just from the sight before him. He walked to her beside.</p>
<p>&#34;We could've made such a good team.&#34; He kicked the plug for the heart monitor out of the wall. &#34;But you made your choice.&#34;</p>
<p>He bent down to her face. &#34;I'd say goodbye, but.let's just get this over with.&#34; He removed the ventilator tube from her mouth, and started to push down on her throat.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>As they raced into the hallway, Willow completely hunched over and nearly screamed. &#34;He's.he's killing her. We have to -&#34;</p>
<p>One of the security guards came running down. His face was bloody, and his shirt was torn. &#34;He's a monster! Don't go.&#34; He kept running.</p>
<p>When they got closer to Buffy's room, they saw more guards' bodies piled up.</p>
<p>'Come on, Goddess. If I ever needed you, it's now.'</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;Remove yourself from this room.&#34; The Goddess said, appearing from behind Angelus.</p>
<p>&#34;Not this time. I'm not finished.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Remove yourself now.&#34; He ignored her. &#34;I banish you from this room. I cleanse it of your evil, and may the goodness of this girl and all she represents torment and torture you.&#34;</p>
<p>Angelus tried to fight the sensations trying to overpower him, but it was gaining strength. His flesh started to crawl, and he felt like he was burning. His head started to throb, feeling like it was about to explode.</p>
<p>&#34;I spare you because it is not my duty to kill you. I leave that pleasurable task up to this girl and her partner. And believe me when say that I sincerely hope it is slow and painful for you.&#34;</p>
<p>He was flung from the room, and the Goddess vanished.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>They reached Buffy's door just as Angelus slumped against the wall. Willow ran over and saw he was shaking.</p>
<p>&#34;Does it hurt? Here, let me help.&#34; Using a combination of slayer and Wicca ability, Willow threw him down the hall, and he crashed into the doors. &#34;I don't think he'll try anything else, but watch him anyway.&#34; She moved to go into the room.</p>
<p>&#34;Good luck.&#34; Giles asked.</p>
<p>&#34;We're all here for you.&#34; Joyce said, as her friends nodded.</p>
<p>&#34;Thanks. And you too, Wesley. Without you.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No need, Willow.&#34; He said, even though he was touched.</p>
<p>&#34;Here goes nothing.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;Hey.&#34; She said to Buffy. &#34;You ready?&#34;</p>
<p>She set candles in a circle at the side of the bed, on the floor. Pink, for love and friendship; White, for peace; Red for protection, passion, strength, and courage; Orange, for vitality; and Purple, for intense healing. She stood in the middle of the circle, and then sat down.</p>
<p>She lit each of the candles, and pulled a bowl, ingredients, and a knife from her duffel bag. She put a dove feather in the bowl, and a powder that held healing properties. She needed something. Symbols of their union.</p>
<p>She took her ring off, and put it in the bowl. She stood up, and leaned over Buffy.</p>
<p>&#34;Just need to borrow this.&#34; She carefully got Buffy's ring off her finger, and put in the bowl.</p>
<p>The final ingredient was some of her blood. Jonas wrote that for a soul to leave its mate's body, it needed something from that person, something familiar in its body to entice it to return. Blood was the best choice.</p>
<p>So Willow took the knife, and cut her finger slightly. She let a few drops fall into the bowl.</p>
<p>Now the true test. She stood once more, and gripped Buffy's hand.</p>
<p>&#34;Help me, okay?&#34; Willow shut her eyes. &#34;With complete love, trust, and friendship, I call on my soulmate within. It is time to return back to the body to which you were born. Our joining is forever, but you must take your rightful place.</p>
<p>&#34;Return knowing that we are one. That flesh is a necessary boundary between us.&#34;</p>
<p>She felt Buffy begin to shake. She felt herself start to shake.</p>
<p>&#34;Our feelings surpass the body. Take comfort in the fact that we are not weakened by minor separation. That the love and feelings are expressed in every possible way. Return to this plane. This physical world. Come back so we can be together as we were meant to. Not just our souls, but our minds and bodies as well. Come back. Come back to me.&#34;</p>
<p>The candles flickered, and the contents of the bowl, created energy in the air, a bright blue energy, that went right into Buffy. Their convulsing increased, and Willow felt something leave, as well as stay.</p>
<p>After a few seconds, it was over. The candles were out, and sometime during the course of the.whatever happened, Willow ended up on the floor. She cleared her head, and jumped up to see if it worked.</p>
<p>Buffy's eyes slowly came open, and she smiled. Willow thought she was going to faint. She had so many things she wanted to say, do, but she had to tell everyone. She squeezed Buffy's hand, and smiled when Buffy squeezed back.</p>
<p>&#34;I'll be right back, okay? Gotta go tell your mom and everyone. Right back. So don't go anywhere.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy rolled her eyes, and Willow went to go get their friends.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Later, Willow sat at Buffy's bedside late after the big welcome back, and after the hectic time they had with the cops, and trying to explain what happened to the guards outside in the hallway.</p>
<p>'Will? You there?'</p>
<p>Willow was a little startled. 'Whoa. It's been a long time.'</p>
<p>'Too long. Come sit the bed up for me?' She got up, and hit the remote, and the bed moved so Buffy was in a sitting position. 'Now come closer.'</p>
<p>'Why?'</p>
<p>&#34;So I can kiss you.&#34; Buffy said aloud, but softly.</p>
<p>Willow leaned in immediately and kissed her soulmate. Her friend. It had been so long. There was a passion and a gentleness to it at first, and then Willow increased it, needing to feel her breath, her warmth. Just to make sure it was real.</p>
<p>And then they stopped, and Willow broke down into sobs. Partly out of sadness, but mostly out of joy. She had been holding it in for months, and it all came pouring out.</p>
<p>&#34;I missed you so much.I.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy put her arm around her, and felt tears start to come as well. Her body had been doing nothing, and she had no way to release her emotions. This was a relief for her. She could feel again, feel Willow again.</p>
<p>&#34;God, I missed you too. But I knew you'd do it.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Now that I have you again.I don't want to let you go.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Then don't.&#34;</p>
<p>And Willow didn't. In fact, she gripped Buffy tighter. &#34;Love you.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I love you too, Will. I love you too.&#34;</p>
<p>They both cried until they couldn't anymore, and fell asleep content in the knowledge that everything was restored, and that they were in each other's arms.</p>
