<p>The lights in Jake's bedroom were off. Candles were lit all around the room. The flames flickered showing the various objects that he had on display. A Freddy Kruger poster hung on his door. A glove with five razors sat on his bureau. All seven films were on his shelf, along with a doll, a dirty brown hat, and red and green sweater.</p>
<p>Playing in his VCR was the original film. The one that started the series. Started his obsession. His friend sat beside him, looking nervous.</p>
<p>&#34;This is crazy.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Why? You scared?&#34; Jake asked, amused.</p>
<p>&#34;Course not, it's just -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Ssh. This is cool. Right before Tina bites it.&#34;</p>
<p>The TV showed Tina, the first victim, staring down an alley at an approaching Freddy.</p>
<p>&#34;Please God.&#34;</p>
<p>He held up his gloved hand. &#34;This.is God.&#34;</p>
<p>Jake focused his attention back on his task. He dropped a magazine clipping of Freddy into a bowl, and a piece of the sweater. He bought the original outfit at a recent auction, it had cost him, and his parents' credit cards a lot of money.</p>
<p>&#34;He's the best horror villain of all time, man.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah, yeah he is. Isn't this.dangerous?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Look, I got this book that said that if people believe in something enough, even something in a movie, it can take on a life of it's own.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;But.he's just a guy in messed up latex.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Maybe, but the name Freddy Kruger scares everybody in some way. He's etched in my mind. Every night I go to sleep.&#34; He knew he sounded nuts, but he was beyond caring.</p>
<p>&#34;So you wanna make him real? Come on, Jake.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;If you don't believe, get out. I won't stop you.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No.no.I'll stay.&#34;</p>
<p>Jake closed his eyes, and began to chant the words from the book. He had become fascinated with the occult. And that coupled with obsessing over a teenage-killing maniac, was not a good mix.</p>
<p>&#34;Bring forth the essence of the being.&#34; Jake lit a match, and started burning the contents of the bowl. Smoke started to rise. &#34;Let him enter reality. Let his evil leave the fictional realm, release him from his prison.&#34;</p>
<p>The wind picked from outside and the candles blew out. The movie was still running.</p>
<p>&#34;I brought something back from my dream.&#34; Nancy said on screen, holding Kruger's hat.</p>
<p>It all stopped after a minute. And both boys jumped up, looking around the room frantically.</p>
<p>&#34;Didn't work.&#34; His friend sighed in relief.</p>
<p>&#34;Guess not.&#34; Jake said, almost sadly.</p>
<p>&#34;See you tomorrow? Gotta get home.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah, tomorrow.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Sleep tight.&#34; He said sarcastically.</p>
<p>&#34;Funny.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>An hour later, Jake went to sleep frustrated. He knew it wasn't going to work, but still.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, he woke up hearing a screeching sound. He reached over to his bureau, and turned on the lamp.</p>
<p>The glove.was missing. He got out of bed quickly.</p>
<p>The TV came on. Little girls in pure white dresses were jump roping in a park. And singing.</p>
<p>&#34;One, two Freddy's coming for you,</p>
<p>&#34;Three, Four better lock your door,</p>
<p>&#34;Five, Six grab your crucifix,</p>
<p>&#34;Seven, Eight better stay up late,</p>
<p>&#34;Nine, Ten never sleep again.&#34;</p>
<p>He went over to the TV, and checked the VCR on top of it. No tape. This dream was different. He didn't feel.in control. He went to turn the TV off, and a gloved hand reached through the screen, and grabbed his shirt.</p>
<p>He was staring face to face with his obsession.</p>
<p>&#34;You wanted me, Piglet. Well, Freddy's home.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;But. this isn't Elm Street.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You watch too many movies.&#34;</p>
<p>The last thing Jake saw was razor blades coming at his eyes.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;So what's the up?&#34; Buffy asked Giles and Willow when she entered her ex-watcher's home.</p>
<p>She had just come back from the college campus. That was not one of her top things to repeat. Trying to explain why you were not attending classes for a little over two months was not easy.</p>
<p>But together with her mother, doctor and nurse testimonials explaining her situation, she had cut a deal. She would study with a tutor to catch up on the stuff she missed. Which wasn't so bad, except that wasn't it. She'd have to attend courses over the summer so she'd have all the necessary credits to not repeat her freshman year.</p>
<p>But besides that, it was amazing how great she felt. She was back. Whole and complete. She could hold Willow again. Ever since she got back, using Willow's own blood to help her come back, they were closer. In every sense of the word.</p>
<p>They just couldn't place how. Something about the spell Wesley provided them with, maybe. Oh, well. It wasn't like it was a bad thing. Plus, they had other things to worry about. Like dealing with Angelus, who had gone into hiding. Nobody liked that at all.</p>
<p>Willow handed her a newspaper. &#34;A gift? Really, Will.&#34; She said sarcastically. The red head smirked a little, but quickly looked worried. Buffy took the hint, and read the headline on the front page. &#34;Teenage boy found murdered. Not to sound uncaring, as I am kind of desensitized, but what else is new?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;The reporter doesn't go into many details, but.he does say that the eyes were.removed. And there were carvings.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Where?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;On his chest. Like razors.&#34; Willow said quietly.</p>
<p>&#34;So that rules out vamps, right?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And leaves us an endless supply of various demons to consider.&#34; Giles said.</p>
<p>&#34;Something.doesn't seem right.&#34; Willow added, sounding unnerved.</p>
<p>Willow was going full-speed into the magick area. She still trained herself, although not with the Goddess, sometimes it was with Buffy. She was more attuned to, well, everything. And it scared her somewhat. Add to that that she still felt residual effects from Buffy's slayerness, and had no idea why, she was rushing to get a grip on everything.</p>
<p>So much had happened to her during the time that Buffy was gone. She had become different. Not in a bad way, just.different. More independent, she was realizing that there was more purpose to everything she did, and everything she would do.</p>
<p>But even as independent as she had become, she thanked whatever forces had helped her to get Buffy back, because she needed her. That was the one thing she was clear on.</p>
<p>&#34;As in?&#34; Buffy asked her.</p>
<p>&#34;Not sure. Just a feeling.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Maybe you should visit the morgue. See if -&#34; Giles started.</p>
<p>&#34;Oh no. Giles, Willow and I are not going to go snooping around in a morgue. You're the reason they say romance is dead, you know. Sending us to places like that.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Do you have to be romantic everywhere you go?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Maybe.&#34; Buffy said, pulling Willow to her, and giving her a quick kiss.</p>
<p>&#34;Then what do you suggest we do?&#34;</p>
<p>'Tell him, Will.'</p>
<p>'Duh! Why didn't I think of that?' Willow sent back, seeing what Buffy had in mind.</p>
<p>&#34;I hack into the medical examiner's files and get the autopsy report. I may have been real witchy lately, but I haven't forgotten how to use a computer.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Plus, it's safer.&#34; Buffy added. &#34;Where's your laptop, Will?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It's in the closet upstairs. I kept it here.while you were gone.I.&#34;</p>
<p>'It's okay. I'm right here.'</p>
<p>Giles watched as Willow nodded to what he assumed was a silent exchange. He was happy, extremely happy, that Buffy was safe, and that Willow had her back. Any parental figure would be. But he was also envious of them. Of the deepness, and the unspoken feelings they shared with one another. He didn't know if he'd ever feel that. He hadn't had enough time with Jenny.</p>
<p>He had shut himself off to the hope of ever finding companionship again, which was probably a bad mistake on his part, but he'd have to live with it. He made his own choices, and he couldn't blame anybody else for them. And he most certainly couldn't hold Buffy and Willow's happiness against them.</p>
<p>&#34;I'll,&#34; They looked at him, &#34;I'll go get it.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Nikki Coleman was an intern. Sunnydale was the only place in the world that offered internships for a morgue. But she was studying forensics/pathology, so it was a good place to learn. She had a pretty strong stomach. She had seen a lot of gruesome stuff come in, and she had dealt with it. She could handle anything.</p>
<p>But the new one that had come in.was weird. The pathologist had found no fingerprints, no real sign of a struggle; and whatever or whoever had done it, had fun. Of course she wasn't supposed to know that, but having access to the computer system helped. It was all part of the learning process.</p>
<p>Besides, she had assisted the pathologist before. She would've found out anyway. Eventually.</p>
<p>The guard had left her alone while he ran home to check on his kids. They had been sick lately. So she was left alone with drawers of dead bodies. They never seemed to run out of those. And it was exhausting.</p>
<p>She could doze off for a few seconds. It wouldn't hurt.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, she opened her eyes.</p>
<p>&#34;I guess sleep doesn't want me.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I want you.&#34; A deep voice said that echoed across the walls.</p>
<p>&#34;Who said that?&#34;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>Then there was a banging. In the storage room. She got up cautiously, and walked into the room. It was quiet, and then.there it was again. It sounded like it was coming from inside one of the drawers.</p>
<p>&#34;But that's impossible.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Nicole.&#34; The voice said her name. How'd it know her name?</p>
<p>The noise started again, and she went over to the drawer she thought it was coming from. Frightened, but curious at the same time, she opened it, and slid out the tray.</p>
<p>Laying on it was a man, about twenty-five years of age. If she remembered correctly, the funeral was in a few days. They were going to give the body to the funeral home tomorrow so they could prepare it. As she was about to push the tray back in, she heard a tearing sound.</p>
<p>Looking down at the man's chest, she was horrified at what she saw. One by one cuts were being made. Jagged ones. When they stopped, she felt sick. They were words.</p>
<p>'DO YOU WANT TO DIE, NIKKI?'</p>
<p>Her mind was telling her to run, but her body wasn't reacting. And that was a mistake. Because the dead body sat up on the tray, and cold hands reached for her. She stumbled backwards into a sitting position against the opposite wall of drawers.</p>
<p>Then all the drawers flung open, one right after the other, and bodies in all types of decay were crawling out. They were making their way towards her. They were everywhere. Moaning and saying her name.</p>
<p>She did what any frightened, unable to move person would do. She closed her eyes, and screamed. And then.silence. Tears streaming down her face, she opened her eyes. There was nothing there. Except the man towering over her, who was moving his fingers, his razors, tauntingly.</p>
<p>&#34;What the hell?&#34; She recognized this guy. Where had she seen him before?</p>
<p>&#34;You think you can handle death? Think you've got the stomach for it?&#34; Kruger lifted her up by the throat so his gloved hand was at the same level as her stomach. &#34;Only one way to find out.&#34;</p>
<p>He rammed his hand into her stomach, his razors piercing her skin, and laughed evilly as she lurched from side to side. She couldn't feel the stomach wound, but she could taste the blood bubbling up in her mouth. She watched it spill to the floor.</p>
<p>&#34;Sorry. You fail, bitch.&#34;</p>
<p>The guard came back, and rushed in when he heard the commotion. He saw Nikki's body in the air, hanging. Before he could go over, and before he registered the blood and other.things that were spilling to the floor, she was thrust across the room and into the computer, which smashed to bits.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;I can't get in.&#34; Willow said, as Giles and Buffy watched her.</p>
<p>&#34;What do you mean?&#34; Giles asked.</p>
<p>&#34;The system must be down, because I'm not getting anything.&#34; She was puzzled.</p>
<p>&#34;Happy now, Giles? Looks like we're off to the morgue.&#34; Buffy said, moving towards the door. &#34;We'll bring you back something nice. Oh, wait. Forget I said that.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Be careful.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Always.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow was still shutting down her laptop. 'Wait up.'</p>
<p>'Forgive me, Miss Slowpoke.'</p>
<p>'I'll get you for that.'</p>
<p>'I hope so.'</p>
<p>Willow blushed as she followed Buffy out the door.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>When they arrived at the morgue, there were cops everywhere, and they had put crime scene tape around the outside of the building. Buffy and Willow watched as a cop, young by the looks of him, came running out and vomited on the grass.</p>
<p>&#34;Get the feeling we missed something?&#34; Buffy asked Willow.</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah and I also get the feeling I'm glad we missed it.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;If I didn't have to do this, I'd be turning around right now, but there's two things we have to figure out.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What happened -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And how to get inside to figure that out.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow thought about it for a second.</p>
<p>'Don't talk and don't make a lot of noise or else this isn't going to work, okay?'</p>
<p>'You're the boss. Are we playing Jedi Mind Trick?'</p>
<p>'Something like that.'</p>
<p>Buffy watched her whisper a few words, and then Willow motioned her to start moving towards the morgue. She was amazed at the amount of ability Willow had managed to tap into. How powerful, magickly, she was. She was glad and worried at the same time.</p>
<p>The gladness was that they had both pretty much figured out that Willow was meant to fight along side her. That she could be in all aspects of her life. And most importantly, that Willow finally realized how gifted and special she was. Something Buffy had been telling her for a long time.</p>
<p>The downside was that Willow was fighting along side her. She couldn't keep her safe anymore. Actually, Willow could probably protect herself better than Buffy ever could. But still, the risks were higher.</p>
<p>She felt Willow's hand on her arm as they continued to walk.</p>
<p>'It worries me too.'</p>
<p>Buffy smiled at her, and they saw a cop staring in their direction. Only he didn't see them. So they kept walking, squeezing past people, praying the spell would hold. They got inside, and looked around.</p>
<p>The chalk outline of the body was on the floor; fresh blood still sitting there as the photographers took pictures. They saw a woman in medical scrubs come out of a side room. One of the cops walked up to her.</p>
<p>&#34;Anything?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Except extreme brutality? No. The most damage was done by the.opening of the stomach, but that wasn't what killed her. Although it would have if the killer was patient. The impact from hitting the computer, and the amount of force, well, it broke her neck. Not to mention caused several lacerations around the facial area.</p>
<p>&#34;Excuse me, she was a friend and.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It's okay, doctor. We'll call you if we need anything more.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy and Willow looked at each other.</p>
<p>'I guess we know why I couldn't use the computer.'</p>
<p>'It's probably the wrong time to bring this up, but why are we assuming demon? Okay, a part of me is just saying that so we can get out of here.'</p>
<p>'We should still.check. Just so we can tell Giles and all.'</p>
<p>Buffy nodded reluctantly, and they made their way into the side room. On a table, covered by a white sheet, lay a body. They were both waiting for the other to remove the sheet. Together, they both went over, and pulled down it down.</p>
<p>&#34;Jesus.&#34; Buffy said aloud.</p>
<p>&#34;Oh my God.&#34; Willow said, putting a hand to her mouth. Then she realized something, and whispered. &#34;The spell's broken.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Then we have to.hurry.&#34; They both stepped up to the body to get a closer look. &#34;Well. I've seen enough.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Wait.&#34; Willow was focused on something. &#34;It looks like after he.opened her.he did one continuous cut up her chest.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What's your point?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;They look like razors.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Like the last.&#34;</p>
<p>They heard people moving. Like they were leaving. They poked their heads around the door, and saw two guys heading their way. They saw the back door in the other direction, and then watched as the two men were stopped momentarily by one of the photographers.</p>
<p>&#34;Make a break for it?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>Willow nodded, and they did.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Later, back at Giles' house, everyone was there. Xander and Oz were watching TV on the couch, Cordelia had her face buried in Xander's chest so she didn't have to look at the screen, and Buffy and Willow were talking with Giles.</p>
<p>&#34;I know this is gonna sound weird, but I've seen that before.&#34; Willow said.</p>
<p>&#34;The person?&#34; Giles asked.</p>
<p>&#34;No, the cuts. The way she died. I've seen it too.&#34; Buffy agreed.</p>
<p>&#34;Dare I ask how?&#34;</p>
<p>They shrugged, and spoke in sync. &#34;Don't remember.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Certainly helpful.&#34;</p>
<p>A loud scream caused the three of them to look in their friends' direction. Buffy walked over to the TV, and watched as girl on a bed flailed around, trying to escape an unseen force.</p>
<p>&#34;What are you guys watching?&#34; She asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Nightmare on Elm Street. Of course it's TV so they edit most of the language, and then there's horrible lip-syncing -&#34; Xander started to rant.</p>
<p>&#34;But it's still a classic.&#34; Oz cut him off.</p>
<p>&#34;Is the killing over?&#34; Cordelia asked, her voice muffled.</p>
<p>Xander grinned at Oz. &#34;Yeah, it's over.&#34;</p>
<p>She looked up just as four, long razor-like cuts sliced the actress' stomach, and blood began pouring out. Cordelia promptly hit Xander. &#34;Jerk.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy kept replaying that in her mind. Razors, slicing, blood, body.</p>
<p>&#34;No way.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What is it?&#34; Giles asked.</p>
<p>&#34;I know this is going to sound crazy, bordering on insane even, but I think I know where I've seen the cuts before.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No way.&#34; Willow echoed.</p>
<p>&#34;Will one of you explain?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Freddy Kruger.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;The villain from those horrid eighties films?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;The very same. The cuts look like it was made by his glove-knife thingy.&#34; Buffy said.</p>
<p>&#34;Whoa. Are you saying Freddy's real and killing? You know, the scary thing is, that doesn't sound as crazy as it should. Damn Hellmouth.&#34; Xander said.</p>
<p>&#34;Let's not jump to hasty conclusions.&#34; Giles said.</p>
<p>&#34;Right. It could be a copycat, some horror film buff.&#34; Willow said.</p>
<p>&#34;That would be Scream.&#34; Oz added.</p>
<p>Giles had picked up the newspaper off of his coffee table. &#34; 'Jake Wilson was found on his bed, apparently murdered, in the early morning hours by his parents. Police searched his room thoroughly, and found little that would explain the reason for the teenager's death.</p>
<p>&#34; 'However they did find an extensive collection of Nightmare on Elm Street merchandise, paying homage to the eighties slasher villain, Freddy Kruger. There has been no evidence to support any connection between his love of the films and his death.'&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;There's your answer.&#34; Xander said.</p>
<p>&#34;What?&#34; Willow asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Just some crazed kid who -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;There's one problem, Xand. He's dead, and there's been another murder. Unless he staged his death, and let's not forget remove his eyes -&#34; Buffy began.</p>
<p>&#34;I get the point. But it's just not possible.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I didn't think vampires were possible, not to mention werewolves, but hey.&#34; Oz said.</p>
<p>There was dead silence, which was eventually broken by Cordelia.</p>
<p>&#34;Anyone want coffee?&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Rob Nachan sat in his bed that night. Jake was dead. After they had done that spell, or whatever it was. Sipping his eighth can of coke, he forced his eyes open. He hadn't believed it would work, but it had. He knew it. And he wasn't taking any chances.</p>
<p>Freddy had left him alone, but it would be his turn soon. A cat screeched in the alley outside his window, and he almost jumped off the bed.</p>
<p>&#34;Keep it together.keep it together.&#34;</p>
<p>He was on guard constantly. This was Sunnydale. It wasn't a town out of a horror film. This kind of thing wasn't supposed to happen. He felt guilty as hell. He should've stopped Jake. Shouldn't have left him alone. That's how Freddy won. There was strength in numbers.</p>
<p>He wouldn't fall asleep.he wouldn't fall asleep.</p>
<p>&#34;Rob, man, get up.&#34;</p>
<p>His eyes were playing tricks on him. It couldn't be. Jake was standing at the foot of his bed.</p>
<p>&#34;Everyone thinks you're dead.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;That's their problem. Come on, I wanna show you something. It's awesome.&#34;</p>
<p>Rob got out of his bed, and followed Jake. His friend opened the bedroom door, and they went out into the hallway.</p>
<p>Except it wasn't the hallway. It was outside. They stood in front of a chipped, white picket fence. Rob's vision went from the overgrown front yard, to the dilapidated house.</p>
<p>&#34;Nancy's house.&#34; He whispered.</p>
<p>&#34;I know. Isn't it great? Come on.&#34;</p>
<p>Rob heard laughter in the wind. Little girls' laughter. He shook his head.</p>
<p>&#34;Wuss.&#34; A flash of lightning suddenly interrupted the darkness of the sky. &#34;You wanna get caught?&#34;</p>
<p>Jake started to run for the front door, and Rob followed. They ran inside, and the door shut behind them. They stood in the foyer, and Rob looked at around the dark house. The windows were boarded up; the stairs were there, that led to Nancy's bedroom, it was all like the movie.</p>
<p>&#34;Now what?&#34; He asked.</p>
<p>&#34;How long can you survive?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Huh?&#34;</p>
<p>Jake turned around. His eyes were missing, and blood dripped from his empty sockets. His stomach showed where Freddy made his cuts, and they started to bleed.</p>
<p>&#34;You left me to die.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I didn't.I didn't know.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You were my friend.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Jake could use some company.&#34; That was Freddy's voice. Rob looked around frantically. When he looked back at Jake, Freddy was standing in his place. &#34;True friends stick together, Rob.&#34;</p>
<p>He pushed Freddy as hard as he could, and ran up the stairs. Their consistency changed, and his feet got locked in place. His balance was off, and he struggled to stay still.</p>
<p>'Think, damn it! Gotta get free.'</p>
<p>He pictured himself strong. His legs powerful. Concentrating, he pulled his feet free, and the step broke. He was about to fall so he grabbed the railing. He finished getting up the stairs.</p>
<p>&#34;Where are you?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;One, two Freddy's coming for you.&#34; A girl's voice said.</p>
<p>He turned into Nancy's room, and looked around for any way to escape. The window. He dove out. And fell, and fell, and fell.</p>
<p>&#34;Wake up! Wake up!&#34;</p>
<p>Rob shot up in bed, sweating. He went to pull off his sheets. They were.red and green.</p>
<p>&#34;You can't escape me.&#34;</p>
<p>The sheets wrapped in a circular motion around his body, slowly, moving from his legs and going up, suffocating him. Crushing his lungs. He felt his bones break.</p>
<p>&#34;Please let me go! Please!&#34;</p>
<p>Those were his last words.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>It was late at night when they all were researching to try and figure out just how Freddy became real. There were different variations on 'making fantasy into reality' incantations, but something was missing. They required a lot of energy and preparation to pull off.</p>
<p>&#34;We're all agreed that it was probably Jake who caused this to happen, correct?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; They all said.</p>
<p>&#34;And he was probably messing with one of these spells.&#34; Willow said.</p>
<p>&#34;I get that much. But how can one kid, who was probably just screwing around, do something like that without help? It just seems.too easy.&#34; Buffy said.</p>
<p>&#34;I really could care less about how he did it. Let's just kill him.&#34; Cordelia said.</p>
<p>&#34;You can't kill Freddy.&#34; Xander said.</p>
<p>&#34;They did it in the films.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And then what happened?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;He came back in the next one.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Well, that's not exactly true.&#34; Oz said. Everyone looked at him. &#34;In the sixth one, they brought him out of the dream plane and finished him off.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What about -&#34; Xander started.</p>
<p>&#34;The seventh one doesn't count. Different storyline.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;How did they bring him out?&#34; Giles asked.</p>
<p>&#34;They held onto him as they woke up. It's a long shot.&#34; Oz said.</p>
<p>&#34;It's one more shot then we had before.&#34; Buffy said. She turned to Giles. &#34;Break out the sleeping bags.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;Okay here's what we're gonna do.&#34; Buffy said when they got everything ready. They moved Giles furniture to the side, and laid blankets and pillows out on the floor.</p>
<p>&#34;Me, Willow, and Oz will go to sleep. The three of you have to stay awake in case it looks like we're in trouble. And if it looks one of us has him, wake us up. Man, I can't believe we're doing this.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Why can't I go in?&#34; Xander asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Do you really want to?&#34; Willow asked.</p>
<p>&#34;I wouldn't let you anyway.&#34; Cordelia told him seriously.</p>
<p>&#34;We'll be counting on you to get us out. Besides Oz's surprisingly extensive knowledge of this stuff might come in handy.&#34; Buffy said.</p>
<p>&#34;Oh.&#34; Xander said masking his disappointment.</p>
<p>&#34;Sleeping pills.&#34; Oz said handing Buffy and Willow each one.</p>
<p>&#34;You're sure you want to do this?&#34; Giles asked.</p>
<p>&#34;We don't have a choice.&#34; Willow said.</p>
<p>The three of them laid down, and within fifteen minutes, were fast asleep.</p>
<p>&#34;I can't believe they have to risk themselves like this again.&#34; Xander said.</p>
<p>&#34;What are you talking about?&#34; Cordelia asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Don't you remember? Freddy goes after your soul.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;Where are we?&#34; Willow asked as she looked around the boiler room.</p>
<p>&#34;More importantly, where's Oz?&#34; They started to walk forward looking at the steaming boilers and the chains that dangled from the ceiling. &#34;Wait. If he separated Oz from us -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Why didn't he split us up?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Welcome to my playground.&#34; Freddy's voice told them.</p>
<p>They both held onto each other a little tighter.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;Damn.&#34; Oz said quietly.</p>
<p>He should have expected this. This was Freddy's turf, and he made sure Oz was isolated. He was in the middle of nowhere, in a field, where strangely enough; there was a bright sun out.</p>
<p>Oz's only hope was to envision himself with Buffy and Willow. Slip past Freddy temporarily. He'd be a goner by himself.</p>
<p>Then, within a blink of an eye, the sunlight was gone, and the night came. And so did the full moon. He dropped to his knees.</p>
<p>&#34;Bring the doggie out to play.&#34; Freddy said.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Xander felt helpless. Ever since he graduated, he had gone from one problem to the next. Job after job, lost to Angelus, ended up in a cast, and now three of his friends were on their own against a dream-hunting, child murderer. And he wasn't allowed to do anything about it.</p>
<p>What good was he? He even felt responsible for Cordelia's situation. It seemed that ever since she had become his girlfriend, she had developed his lifestyle. Her family riches disappeared, and the life she was used to was taken away. So, she tried to make it own her own, barely managed, and now she was stuck back here. She had come back to him. Why?</p>
<p>Everyone had a purpose except for him. An ability. A strength. Something that made them part of the group. Even Cordelia. She had an inner strength, an ability to rationalize something down to its simplest form when everyone was about to lose it. What was he? A distraction. A demon punching bag.</p>
<p>Cordelia walked over to him. And slapped him.</p>
<p>&#34;What was that for?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I know self-pitying when I see it. Knock it off. And pay attention.&#34; Her gaze went down to Oz, who was shaking a little. &#34;Should we wake him up?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Not yet. If he really starts moving then -&#34; Giles was rubbing his eyes. Xander saw the struggle he was having. &#34;Giles, you need sleep.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;As much as I want to, I can't.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;We'll watch them. We're the younger generation here. Got more energy.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;He's talking about Kruger, Xander.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Oh. He never goes after adults. He has his boundaries you know. You'll be safe. Besides, I'm sure he's got his hands full.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I really should.&#34; Giles yawned.</p>
<p>Cordelia started pushing him up the stairs. &#34;Go to bed. We'll wake you if there's real trouble.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Buffy and Willow kept walking through the boiler room. They ran across a catwalk, and a long set of metal steps. Wherever Freddy was, he wasn't showing himself. They heard screeching on one of the pipes.</p>
<p>&#34;Show yourself, asshole!&#34; Buffy screamed.</p>
<p>'Where the hell is he?' She asked Willow silently.</p>
<p>'I don't kn -'</p>
<p>'I'M HERE.' Freddy's voice said, penetrating their heads.</p>
<p>They grabbed their heads in pain, and ran to the bottom of the stairs. They ran to the right, and stopped when they saw a large furnace. Willow reached out and touched it. It was cold.</p>
<p>&#34;What happens to witches, Willow?&#34; Freddy's voice taunted.</p>
<p>Willow didn't speak, and Buffy was worried. &#34;Will?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;They get burned.&#34; She answered softly.</p>
<p>&#34;Correct, bitch.&#34;</p>
<p>The furnace door swung open and a fire started inside. The flames were huge. Before Willow knew what was happening, she was flung inside.</p>
<p>&#34;No!&#34; Buffy screamed, and without thinking, dove in after her.</p>
<p>Freddy now stood in where Buffy and Willow had been. He shut the furnace door.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm just getting warmed up.&#34; He laughed, and vanished.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Oz was transforming. His werewolf side was taking over. And there wasn't anything he could do to stop it.</p>
<p>He looked up through half animal, half human eyes, at an approaching Freddy. The man took off his hat, revealing more of his burned face.</p>
<p>&#34;Nice doggy.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Don't come near me.&#34; Oz growled.</p>
<p>&#34;Can't let a wild animal run free.&#34;</p>
<p>A spiked collar appeared around Oz's neck, and a long pole came out of the ground, to which he found himself chained. The ground changed, and he was now sitting atop coals, and a fire raged around him.</p>
<p>&#34;Hungry?&#34; Freddy asked. Out of the fire came the forms of Buffy, Willow, Xander, Cordelia, and Giles. &#34;Eat up.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Oz.&#34; The voices of his friends called to him.</p>
<p>&#34;They want you to. They're begging for it.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No!&#34;</p>
<p>He transformed completely now, and his feral form snapped the chain, and went right for Freddy.and sunk his teeth into the killer's arm. Freddy screamed, and Oz vanished into nothingness.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Giles laid in his bed, restless. Turning to his side, he came face with Jenny. More specifically, her body. He jumped out of bed, horrified, and saw Angelus standing over her.</p>
<p>&#34;What do you think, Rupert? Should I turn her head to the left or to the right?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You monster.&#34;</p>
<p>Giles charged him, and began punching him. Hard and furiously. All his pent up hatred was coming out. And all Angelus did was laugh. Somehow Giles found himself holding a stake.</p>
<p>With single-minded determination, he drove it home. Angelus looked down at it and then back up at him. The vampire's form changed, into Freddy Kruger.</p>
<p>&#34;Good aim.&#34; He grabbed Giles by his throat. &#34;No one's safe from me.&#34;</p>
<p>Giles was tossed onto the bed, and Jenny got on top of him. Her broken neck made her head sit at a strange angle. She pushed her hands onto his throat.</p>
<p>&#34;You never were good enough for me.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No.this isn't you.it isn't you, Jenny.&#34; Giles gasped.</p>
<p>He used his knees to lift her up, and then threw her backwards off the bed. He felt himself being forced down, and he disappeared into the mattress.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Xander and Cordelia saw their friends' bodies lurching and moving wildly. Cordelia was on the verge of full-blown panic, and Xander wasn't handling it much better. He tried to shake them, but they weren't coming awake.</p>
<p>&#34;Wake up! Snap out of it!&#34; He yelled. Cordelia ran over and tried slapping Buffy in the face, but that didn't work either. &#34;Get Giles!&#34;</p>
<p>She ran upstairs.</p>
<p>'Do you want to be responsible for killing your friends? Come on Xander.'</p>
<p>Cordelia came running back down. &#34;He's doing the same thing.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'm going in.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No you're not.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I have to.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;There's four of them against one of him, and they're still getting beat. How much better do you think you'll do?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I have to do -&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy, Willow, and Oz stopped moving, and they stopped arguing.</p>
<p>&#34;God.are they dead?&#34;</p>
<p>Xander closed his eyes, and bent down to feel Willow's pulse. He smiled in relief. &#34;No.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Then what the hell is going on in there?&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Buffy and Willow landed in a hallway. Actually, they crashed through a window.</p>
<p>&#34;Are you okay?&#34; They both asked at the same time.</p>
<p>&#34;Your friends thought they could save you. Thought they could wake you. But you belong to me now.&#34; Freddy's voice said.</p>
<p>Before either of them could respond, Oz came crashing through another window. Followed by Giles.</p>
<p>They all rushed over to one another. Oz was human again.</p>
<p>&#34;Thank God you're okay.&#34; Willow said to Oz.</p>
<p>&#34;What are you doing here, Giles?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Xander said.it doesn't matter now. How do we capture him?&#34;</p>
<p>They all looked at Oz. &#34;Each of us has some power, some strength. If we work together, and hit him hard enough, we can grab onto him. Once we do that.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You won't get the chance. I'm forever.&#34; Freddy said, standing at the end of the hallway.</p>
<p>&#34;If you're so sure of yourself, why don't you come and get us?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>&#34;As you wish.&#34; He said, now behind them. Buffy spun around, and he sliced her arm. Willow's arm was cut too. &#34;Two bodies, one nice, juicy soul. Delicious.&#34; He said licking his lips.</p>
<p>&#34;Get him!&#34; Giles yelled.</p>
<p>Oz and Giles went to grab him, but he knocked them back.</p>
<p>&#34;Five, Six grab your crucifix.&#34; A little girl's voice said, eerily.</p>
<p>Buffy and Willow both pulled their matching crosses off their necks, and held them up to his face. He recoiled, and covered his face with his hands. Buffy kicked his glove off his hand, and Willow caught it and put it on.</p>
<p>&#34;You're not so tough without this.&#34;</p>
<p>She moved in to attack him with it. Her hand turned around involuntarily, and the blades were coming at her eyes. Oz tackled her to the ground, and yanked the glove off her hand. It flew back onto Freddy's.</p>
<p>&#34;Wanna try again?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;He knows we're powerful together. He tried to get to us separately, but we beat him. We saw past his tricks.&#34; Buffy told everyone. &#34;And he knows he can't beat us until he wears us down. Until we feel like giving up. So don't.&#34;</p>
<p>Freddy grimaced, opened his mouth, and blew. They all flew down the hallway, and through an open door.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;Come on, guys. You can beat him.&#34; Xander said.</p>
<p>He saw cut marks on Buffy and Willow's arms. He was scared. He couldn't wake them up and couldn't help them. How much longer would they have to wait?</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Buffy stood.somewhere. She couldn't see a thing. It was misty and there was thick fog. She could barely see in front of her. If what Freddy said was the truth, and it would make sense, she and Willow were sharing a soul, so she couldn't be far away.</p>
<p>That explained a lot, actually. The reason why he couldn't separate them, the reason they had matching cuts, and the reason for their new closeness. Now, they were connected mind, body, and soul.</p>
<p>And Freddy was after them for it.</p>
<p>&#34;Willow! Giles! Oz! Can you hear me?&#34; She yelled into the fog.</p>
<p>She walked forward. Standing in place was not a good idea. She had to find her friends. As she continued, the ground under her started to loosen. And then it completely gave way.</p>
<p>She fell into water. Deep water. Then a hand started pushing her down. As much as she tried, she kept getting pushed farther and started gasping for air.</p>
<p>&#34;What's the matter? Water got you down?&#34; Freddy asked.</p>
<p>Damn him for finding her fear. Flashes of the Master and her death entered her mind. And then his hand jerked away.</p>
<p>&#34;Let her go!&#34; It was Willow. Buffy heard a noise, then Freddy scream, and then Willow called to her. &#34;Buffy, swim up!&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy fought to swim to the water's surface, and she saw Willow reach for her.</p>
<p>&#34;Grab my hand.&#34;</p>
<p>She did, and together, they pulled her out of the water. Willow immediately wrapped her arms around her.</p>
<p>&#34;Thanks.how did you.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Magick.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Gotta love it. We're never gonna find Giles and Oz in this.&#34;</p>
<p>They stood up, and Willow called out. &#34;He's hiding in here! We gotta get rid of this. On the count of three, think about getting through the fog.</p>
<p>&#34;One,</p>
<p>&#34;Two,&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Three.&#34; Freddy said, reaching out and grabbing Willow, and pulling her into the fog.</p>
<p>What they did was enough, though, because an archway formed, and Giles and Oz came running down the clear pathway.</p>
<p>&#34;He has her.&#34; Buffy told them.</p>
<p>Then more of the fog cleared, showing more of a path. &#34;Follow the breadcrumbs to the Witch.&#34; Except they weren't breadcrumbs, they were drops of blood.</p>
<p>They looked at one another, and ran down the path.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>They ended up at a house, and the only thing visible was the door. Buffy opened it, and they were about to go in when something jumped out and tackled Oz. His werewolf form.</p>
<p>&#34;Meet your better half.&#34; Freddy told him.</p>
<p>&#34;Go!&#34; Oz yelled to Giles and Buffy, struggling with the wolf.</p>
<p>&#34;No. That's what he wants.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Find her!&#34;</p>
<p>Giles steered Buffy inside, and the door shut behind them. She looked down at her chest, where a golden cord protruded outward. It was her connection to Willow.</p>
<p>&#34;Shame if that broke.&#34; Freddy said in front of them, dangling his razors over it. &#34;Then she's mine.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No way in hell.&#34;</p>
<p>She assumed battle stance, as did Freddy. Her eyes told Giles to go find Willow. He reluctantly followed the cord, leaving Buffy alone with Freddy. She sweep kicked him, but he jumped out of the way.</p>
<p>&#34;Is that all you've got, bitch?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You kidding? I'm just getting started.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Giles ran into a large room. Willow was in the center, tied to a large, wooden stake that was situated vertically over a boiling pot of water, and a fire. She was gagged.</p>
<p>&#34;Hang on, Willow. I'll cut you down.&#34;</p>
<p>She shook her head and mumbled something he couldn't understand. Then, surrounding them were people in conservative, black and white dress. They were Puritans.</p>
<p>&#34;Kill the sinner! Burn the Heretic!&#34; They chanted.</p>
<p>&#34;Religion. The ultimate sin.&#34; Freddy's voice echoed through the room.</p>
<p>&#34;Lower her!&#34; The crowd shouted.</p>
<p>Giles tried to reach her, but they forced him back.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;You may be forever now,&#34; Buffy said to Kruger, &#34;but you know the difference between movies and reality?&#34;</p>
<p>Freddy took a swing at her, and she dodged to the side and kicked him in the groin.</p>
<p>&#34;Once I kill you, you aren't coming back in a sequel.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You haven't won yet.&#34;</p>
<p>He quickly recovered, and opened his mouth. A tongue flew out, and latched itself around Buffy's throat. She started to choke, and tried to pull it off. Seeing the cord that connected her to Willow, she grabbed it, and wrapped it around Freddy's neck.</p>
<p>The tongue unlatched itself, and Buffy let the cord down. She grabbed his head, twisted, and he dropped to the ground.</p>
<p>She knew he wasn't out, but it gave her time to get to Willow. With that in mind, she ran along the cord's path.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>'Relax. You can get out of this. You're in control.' Willow told herself.</p>
<p>She pictured the stake she was tied to being swung past the pot. Slowly snapping the rope used to lower her. She felt it start to move slowly. She had her eyes closed, but she could tell it was working because there were gasps from the crowd.</p>
<p>The rope was tearing; people were starting to panic. Willow felt herself fall, and the stake stuck vertically into the ground. There were screams, and then.nothing. She opened her eyes, and the only other person in the room, was Giles.</p>
<p>&#34;Little help?&#34; She asked.</p>
<p>He rushed over, and began to untie the ropes. Buffy came running in, and the cord vanished.</p>
<p>&#34;You're okay.&#34; Buffy said, and began to help Giles untie.</p>
<p>&#34;Where's Freddy?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I distracted him for a minute but -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You're finished.&#34; His voice called to them.</p>
<p>Just as the ropes fell away, and Willow walked free once more, Freddy dropped from the ceiling, his arms elongated, and landed on top of them. His arms wrapped around the three of them, and they were smothered in red-green fabric.</p>
<p>Freddy was looking directly at Buffy and Willow as he was crushing their bodies.</p>
<p>&#34;Give us a kiss.&#34; He flicked his tongued in an up and down motion. &#34;Your soul is mine, Piglets.&#34;</p>
<p>Just then, Oz and his werewolf half, came crashing through the wall, struggling. Freddy got distracted, and loosened his grip. The three of them worked together, and pushed him off.</p>
<p>Oz rolled into the pot of boiling water, knocking it over, and pushing his werewolf into the fire underneath. It burned, howling. The pot spilled its water all over Freddy, who cried out in pain, holding his face.</p>
<p>&#34;Grab him!&#34; Buffy yelled. The four of them rushed and tackled him to the ground, holding on as tight as they possibly could. &#34;Get us outta here, Will.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow closed her eyes, and.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Xander and Cordelia both nearly jumped through the ceiling when their three friends shot awake. They all got up immediately, and started looking around.</p>
<p>&#34;Did you get him?&#34; Xander asked, grabbing a knife he got from the kitchen, off of the table.</p>
<p>&#34;We had him.&#34; Oz said.</p>
<p>&#34;Then where is he?&#34; Cordelia asked.</p>
<p>As she asked that, dropping out of thin air and landing at their feet, came Freddy's form. But he wasn't doing anything. He was curled up, and his skin started to melt away, his form disintegrating. Into an angry, slimy, green, clawed demon.</p>
<p>It sprung up, snarling. And it tackled Buffy to the ground. Without thinking, Xander jammed the sharp knife, into the demon's back, piercing its heart. It shrieked, and burst into flames, vanishing.</p>
<p>For a few minutes, no one spoke. Buffy and Willow embraced, finally realizing how close they came to losing each other again. They broke apart, and went up to Xander.</p>
<p>&#34;You saved our lives.&#34; Willow told him seriously, and then hugged him.</p>
<p>&#34;Well done.&#34; Giles said warmly.</p>
<p>Oz simply patted him on the back.</p>
<p>&#34;That's two I owe you, Xand.&#34; Buffy said. She hugged him tightly.</p>
<p>He smiled, but didn't know what to say. He didn't have to. Maybe he wasn't so useless after all.</p>
<p>&#34;We're all alive, great, but one question.&#34; Cordelia said, breaking the moment, as she was known to do. They looked at her. &#34;What the hell.was that?&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Underground, in the Master's old lair, Angelus sat on the ground, speaking with a cloaked figure.</p>
<p>&#34;We have provided all the help we're willing to give. A minion is dead. I hope the distraction and loss was worth it.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;All the preparations are almost finished. After I collect the last items, all that's left is waiting for the proper time to come. Then you and your minions can come through.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Our arrival must occur or we will have to wait another thousand years. See that it is not interrupted.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It won't be.&#34;</p>
<p>The figure vanished, and for the first time in his incredibly long existence, Angelus was frightened.</p>

<p>The Bronze. When was the last time they had been here? It was nice to do a semi-normal thing after what they'd been through. Very nice in fact. They were on the dance floor, slowly moving to the music of the Dingoes.</p>
<p>Buffy was leaning against Willow, feeling protected and safe. Her body was still getting used to working again, and her slayerness was getting used to being &#34;with&#34; her, and adjusting. She was doing okay, but she could've done without battling Freddy Kruger. Even though she had been dreaming, she still came out of it exhausted.</p>
<p>Since she and Willow were connected, she felt somewhat tuned to the magickal side of things. She had nowhere near the skill that Willow had, but it was there. And likewise, Willow had some slayer ability still in her. Her reflexes were still sharp, and she was still pretty tough physically.</p>
<p>But they didn't dwell on that. To them they were just two freshman college girls who happened to be in love. Sure they were special in ways other people weren't, but that didn't mean that they didn't want to be normal every once and awhile, and have a good time. Just like they were trying to do now.</p>
<p>&#34;Great song.&#34; Buffy said into Willow's neck.</p>
<p>&#34;Oz said the band was trying different stuff.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It worked.&#34;</p>
<p>They were silent for a little bit after that, and went slowly to sit down on one of the couches. Buffy got as close as she could. She needed comfort. No matter how hard she tried, her thoughts always seemed to drift toward the negative end.</p>
<p>&#34;Nice of Giles to give us time off.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah.more like forced, but.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy? What's wrong?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I just.I feel like I've missed a lot.&#34; Willow gave her a puzzled look. Buffy's mind wasn't sending out clear thoughts. &#34;You. Look at you. Bad ass Wicca, trained by a Goddess, independent, subbed as a slayer.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;How come I don't like the sound of this?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I missed that. I wasn't there for you. You didn't need me to do those things. What good am I?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I didn't hear that, but I'll answer anyway, cause I don't want you to have depressed thoughts. I. Need. You. The world needs you. The world needs me too, now, and I'm scared. You think I planned on all that happened?</p>
<p>&#34;I did what I had to do, because I didn't have a choice. But I can't do it alone anymore. I need someone who's been in the business of world saveage, and knows how to deal. Someone who understands what it's like, and can support me.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Who, Superman?&#34; Buffy teased.</p>
<p>&#34;I don't need him to sweep me off my feet. You've already done that.&#34;</p>
<p>'That was pure sap.'</p>
<p>'I'm not finished.'</p>
<p>&#34;And I need someone to love me.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Who might that be?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I think you know her.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;She cute?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Absolutely.&#34; They kissed. &#34;She's you, you know.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Thanks.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I help. It's what I do.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Nobody does it better.&#34; They kissed again, and knew they wanted to go.</p>
<p>&#34;You're sure you're okay, now? You're not faking it?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You tell me.&#34; She let her mind be completely open, and Willow smiled. She was the only one who could relieve Buffy's depression with just a few words of reassurance. &#34;Let's say bye to Oz and go home.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Giles, Xander, and Cordelia were trying to figure out what had been keeping Angelus so preoccupied. The magick shop had been ransacked twice in the past week, done after the shop had closed for the night. He was preparing for something, that much they were sure of.</p>
<p>Despite Buffy's attempts, Giles basically told her to take a long overdue rest/vacation from everything. She and Willow had been through a trying ordeal, and they were both emotionally and physically drained. They needed time, and unless it was absolutely necessary, he wouldn't ask, or let them, fight.</p>
<p>It was basically the information gathering stage anyway. The quiet before Angelus brought them their next crisis. While they were trying to piece things together, Wesley was on his own, gathering information from underground sources in town. He had no desire to go back to England, or be anywhere near the Council.</p>
<p>Giles looked over at Xander and Cordelia. They seemed awfully distant, and now that he thought about it, they had been distant for awhile. On the surface they seemed the same, but he could see it in their eyes. With everything that had been going on, he hadn't noticed it. Oz, Buffy, and Willow probably hadn't either.</p>
<p>&#34;Are.are you two all right?&#34; Xander and Cordelia weren't the easiest people to read, particularly because they both hid behind their different personalities. Xander, the jokester, and Cordelia the detached, mean, and untouchable one. He figured the direct approach was the best way.</p>
<p>&#34;Fine.&#34; They both said quickly, giving what Giles knew was an automated response.</p>
<p>&#34;You're.sure?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Uh huh.&#34; The last two words were spoken in a tone that said, 'I don't want to talk about it.'</p>
<p>He saw them share a look, and then look down at the newspapers they were reading.</p>
<p>Somehow he got the feeling that he couldn't help them with this. Not by himself anyway. He'd talk to Buffy and Willow tomorrow. He wanted to see them okay, not distracted. That was something they couldn't afford. It made them more susceptible to attacks. But mainly, he wanted to see them happy. He felt like a father to them, and he'd help any way he could.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Hearing a knock on their door, Willow untangled herself from Buffy's embrace, and slumped out of bed. She wrapped a sheet around her body.</p>
<p>&#34;Willow.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I have to answer it. Just keep my spot warm.&#34; Willow smiled at her. Buffy frowned, and she almost ignored the door. Then the knocks came again. &#34;Patience.&#34;</p>
<p>She opened the door. Giles was standing outside. &#34;Giles!&#34; Willow blushed.</p>
<p>&#34;Ah.hello.&#34; He said, turning the same shade as Willow</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy! Giles is here!&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Hi Giles! How you doing?&#34; Buffy called quickly from inside.</p>
<p>&#34;Um.fine. I.needed to talk to you two about something.&#34; He stuttered.</p>
<p>&#34;Great! Well, we'll just get.meet you at the lounge in the main hall.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'll just.go wait.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Fifteen minutes?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Bye, Giles!&#34; Buffy said, as Willow shut the door.</p>
<p>Willow faced her, and they both started laughing.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Later, Buffy and Willow entered the lounge, seeing Giles sitting in a chair over in the corner. They walked over and sat down next to him.</p>
<p>&#34;So what'd you need to talk to us about?&#34; Willow asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Does a demon need to be pummeled?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Not yet. It's about Xander and Cordelia actually. Something seems to be troubling them.&#34;</p>
<p>The three of them saw Oz spot them, and he made his way over.</p>
<p>&#34;Hey.&#34; He said.</p>
<p>&#34;Xander and Cordelia.&#34; Buffy said.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&#34;We've been so wrapped up in stuff.and I knew that something was bothering Xander, I just didn't have the time to.&#34; Willow trailed off.</p>
<p>&#34;Cordelia's really good at pretending to cope. I never would've guessed...tutor!&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Huh?&#34; The three of them asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Tutor. Is on his way over here. I didn't do the assignment.&#34;</p>
<p>'Buffy.'</p>
<p>'You're distracting.'</p>
<p>'Now it's my fault?'</p>
<p>'Completely.'</p>
<p>'Then I'll make you do the assignment later. No distractions till you're done.'</p>
<p>'Not fair.'</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy.&#34; The older student was saying.</p>
<p>&#34;Oh.hi.almost done it.I swear.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I hope so. It's for your benefit.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Understood. Promise.&#34; He walked away, and she saw Giles giving her a look. &#34;Going back to the very important subject of our friends, we were going to talk to Xander anyhow, so.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;We could split up. Oz go with Buffy and talk to Xander, and I'll talk to Cordelia.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You want to talk to Cordelia alone?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Brave.&#34; Oz said.</p>
<p>&#34;I'll go with you, Willow.&#34; Giles said. He might not have been able to help them alone, but with Willow it would be easier. He was the parental, backup support, type of person. &#34;They're both at Xander's now, I think.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Then that's where we're going.&#34; Buffy said.</p>
<p>They got up and started to head off campus, walking a few feet behind Giles and Oz.</p>
<p>&#34;He was checking you out.&#34; Willow said.</p>
<p>&#34;Somebody's possessive.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yes you are. And I like it.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Well, can't really blame him.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'm yours.but remember, public place.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Buffy!&#34;</p>
<p>She grinned at the look of shock on Willow's face. She was easy to unravel, but it was still fun. They linked arms, and Willow relaxed.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>As the two of them sat in Xander's basement, they were together and alone at the same time. He and Cordelia sat up against the headboard of his bed, silent. They reasoned that if they didn't acknowledge the situation they both found themselves in, they could pretend there wasn't a problem.</p>
<p>It wasn't about being useful to their friends, or contributing, they knew they could do that. Xander proved that to himself when he shoved a knife through the &#34;Freddy demon's&#34; back a week or so ago. And Cordelia had surprised herself when she was there for Willow during Buffy's absence, and was actually comforting.</p>
<p>No, the problem was with the way their lives were going. They were stuck in a rut. More like rooted in a rut. Xander was jobless, and didn't have the grades to even get into Sunnydale's college. Cordelia was also jobless, but she did have the smarts to further her education, she just couldn't afford it.</p>
<p>Most people would say it's their own fault, and to a point, they'd agree. They wanted to do something with their lives, something productive, they just weren't sure how or what. And that was a minor problem. The biggest ones were denial and lack of self-esteem.</p>
<p>They wanted to be able to open up and deal together, but.they were scared to. Both were afraid to admit they needed help. Especially to each other. They faced one another slowly, debating whether or not to speak. Then their friends came down.</p>
<p>Before they had time to say and anything, Buffy and Oz already started to drag Xander off the bed, and Giles and Willow were doing the same to Cordelia.</p>
<p>&#34;What are you doing?&#34; Cordelia asked, her voice raised.</p>
<p>&#34;Things to do. Hurry. Long day.&#34; Willow said.</p>
<p>They got outside, and the two groups, went in opposite directions. Xander glanced over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#34;We'll meet up with them later. Got things to do first.&#34; Buffy said.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Buffy and Oz took Xander to the miniature golf course outside of town. He was suspicious, because they knew he was the only one who really enjoyed doing eighteen holes of trying to get a golf ball in a frog's mouth. But he went along with it. One reason was because they were already halfway through the course, and two, because he was winning.</p>
<p>&#34;So, Xand.are you trying to steal the 'Quiet Award' from Oz today or what?&#34; Buffy asked him.</p>
<p>&#34;It's a recognition I'd like to keep.&#34; Oz said.</p>
<p>&#34;I knew it.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Knew what?&#34; She asked.</p>
<p>&#34;That you had another reason for bringing me here.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No I didn't. Okay, it was partly to figure out what's been going on with you, and to spend quality time with a friend I haven't seen in two months.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;There's nothing going on.&#34;</p>
<p>Oz lined up for his shot. &#34;Benefit of minimal talking is learning to read people.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Do you see where he's going?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I can handle it.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Handle what? Speak to us.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You can't fix my problems.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No, but we can get you to want to fix them for yourself. What are they?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Self esteem.&#34; Oz said, as he hit the ball, and it went over to the other side of the windmill.</p>
<p>&#34;Is he right?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;If he is?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Then I don't understand why. You have no reason to -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Oh come on, Buffy. Look at my life.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You may think it's hard, but you're just out of high school. Things are tough. I know.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;How? You don't know what -&#34; Buffy looked at him wide-eyed. &#34;I'm sorry. I didn't mean.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Maybe this was a bad idea.&#34;</p>
<p>She lined up to take her shot next. She swung, and she and Oz started to walk towards the hole. &#34;That's it? You're just gonna give up on me?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;That's what you want, isn't it? Fine. We'll just finish and go -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I have low self-esteem okay? I've been fired from every job I've gotten since graduation, I've been hospitalized, my family could care less about me, Cordelia's in the same -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Xander.&#34; A light bulb went off in her head, and she smiled. It was so simple.</p>
<p>&#34;Here comes the pity.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No pity. Just understanding. Cause I know what you need.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What's that?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;To open up.&#34; Oz said.</p>
<p>&#34;Isn't that what I'm doing?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Not to us. Cause as close as we are, we can't help you.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Cordelia.&#34; Oz stated.</p>
<p>&#34;No that would just -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Look, you're right. I don't know how hard it is for you. You and I are in two totally different situations. But Cordelia does. Cause she's going through it too.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What happened to her isn't your fault.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You love her don't you?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Well, yeah.&#34; Xander said.</p>
<p>&#34;And she loves you back. You two are the only ones who can...I could tell you all day how worth it you are, how you'll get a job, how you're a great person and you have no reason to doubt that you'll lead a good life, but it wouldn't make a difference.</p>
<p>&#34;You'd think I was saying it because I'm your friend, then you'd smile, maybe even say you'd try, but it wouldn't go anywhere. Cordelia's always been honest with you, and if you two love each other, you can help each other. I know this for a fact.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;How would we do that? We'd just make each other more depressed.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You'd give each other the kick start to get moving. A reason not to give up.&#34; Oz said.</p>
<p>&#34;I don't know.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;How do you feel now?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Miserable. Depressed.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It can only get better then. What have you got to lose?&#34;</p>
<p>Xander seemed to be thinking about it.</p>
<p>&#34;Let's finish up.&#34; Oz said.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Walking around the mall, Cordelia, Willow and Giles were shopping. Actually, Cordelia persuaded Giles to give her his credit card. He was a little more than worried at this point. She had about five bags full of stuff, and finally decided to stop because her legs were cramping.</p>
<p>She said she had to use the bathroom, so she made her way there, leaving Giles and Willow to wait for her. That had been ten minutes ago.</p>
<p>&#34;I should go in there.&#34; Willow said.</p>
<p>&#34;Well, we did bring her here in order to -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Can I help it if she's not the easiest person to talk to?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Perhaps you should try now. Before my bill gets any higher.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow made a face at him, and went inside.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>She found Cordelia sitting on the tiled floor, crying. The bags were at her side. She looked up at Willow through tear-filled eyes.</p>
<p>&#34;You don't really want to sit on the floor, do you?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Why not? I should get used to it now so it isn't a big shock later.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Don't say that.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;These,&#34; Cordelia said rifling through the clothes in the bags, &#34;aren't me anymore. I'm a worthless, has-been, waitress.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow got down on the floor next to her. &#34;The clothes were never 'you.' You're a person. Clothes don't make you who you are?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Says who?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Ghandi. He didn't where anything spectacular, wasn't rich either. But he was a great man.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You know just how to wield that knowledge talent of yours, don't you?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Had to prove my point somehow.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Well, I'm not Ghandi. I'm me, and I have different needs.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You need to have everything?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Not everything.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You just think you do.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I know that sounds selfish, it's just.I've had everything my whole life.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Must be hard to revert.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It is.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Well, what do you have?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;A couple pairs of disgusting shoes.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You know what I mean.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I don't know. A job, crappy as it is, friends I guess.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You guess?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I know I do. A &#34;Faith-esque&#34; apartment, can't forget that, a lousy Honda,&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What about intelligence, looks, acceptance letters from very good colleges,&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Are we forgetting the fact that I have barely enough money to live off right now?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;There's ways to get into colleges, and you know that. What about Xander?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;What about him?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You have him too, don't you?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Sorta. We're kinda.in the same life place right now.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;So why aren't you talking to him about it? Maybe that's what you need.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And make him feel worse? I mean we all knew he was going to end up.damn it. I didn't want to say that.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;He convinced himself a long time ago that he was going to be where he is now.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Well that's just stupid. No wonder he -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And he blames himself for you ending up like him.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;He does? It's not his fault.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Don't you think he needs to hear that?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I want to talk to him.but I'm afraid.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Of what?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;He went out with me because I was popular and.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You think that's why he loves you?</p>
<p>&#34;He loves me?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Don't you?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah, I do.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;He's with you because you're you. Not because you had money, or school status. He's still with you, and guess what? High school's been over. You need each other right now. That's obvious.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Then what?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Well, whatever you decide to do, at least you'll be doing it together. It's good to have someone who understands and supports you. First-hand knowledge here. Now come on, and get off the floor.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>They walked out of the bathroom and over to Giles.</p>
<p>&#34;Is everything all right?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah.&#34; Cordelia said.</p>
<p>&#34;Ready to go?&#34; Willow asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Almost. I just need to return this stuff.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Oh, Cordelia you don't have to -&#34; He started.</p>
<p>&#34;Thanks, Giles. I mean it. But.I don't need this.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Later, at the Bronze, the two couples were dancing. Xander and Cordelia, Buffy and Willow. Oz had to go lock himself in the mausoleum, it being the first night of the change. There was no band playing that night, just a DJ.</p>
<p>&#34;This next song, is by Dave Matthews' Band, called 'Best Of What's Around'.&#34;</p>
<p>A few seconds later, the song started.</p>
<p>(Hey my friend <br></p>
 It seems your eyes are troubled Care to share your times with me Would you say you're feeling low and so A good idea would be to get it off your mind)<p>Xander and Cordelia looked at each other, seeing the things they didn't want to say.</p>
<p>(See, you and me <br></p>
 Have a better time than most can dream Have it better than the best And so can pull on through Whatever tears at us Whatever holds us down And if nothing can be done We'll make the best of what's around)<p>Buffy smiled at Willow, who smiled back, and then they looked over at their friends. Xander leaned in and kissed Cordelia, and they followed suit.</p>
<p> (Turns out not where but who you're with <br></p>
 That really matters And hurts not much when you're around)<p>'Buffy.' Willow thought.</p>
<p>'Willow.' Buffy thought.</p>
<p>'Xander.' Cordelia thought.</p>
<p>'Cordelia.' Xander thought.</p>
<p>(If you hold on tight <br></p>
 To what you think is your thing You may find you're missing all the rest She run up into the light surprised Her arms are open Her mind's eye is)<p>Xander and Cordelia stopped dancing, and so did Buffy and Willow.</p>
<p>(Seeing things from a <br></p>
 Clearer side than most can dream On a better road I feel So you could say she's safe Whatever tears at her Whatever holds her down And if nothing can be done She'll make the best of what's around)<p>They were all waiting. And it was about to happen. Buffy and Willow held their breath.</p>
<p>(Turns out not where but what you think <br></p>
 That really matters And hurts not much when you're around)<p>&#34;I need you to help me.&#34; Xander and Cordelia said at the same time.</p>
<p>Buffy and Willow gave themselves a mental high five. They looked over at the door where Giles was standing quietly. They gave him a thumbs up, and waited for the next song to start.</p>

<p>The beach was nice at night. Kind of cold, but it gave the four of them an excuse to wear jackets. Something you didn't get to do very often in Southern California. They had a basket full of food. Well, it used to be.</p>
<p>Buffy sat up against Willow with her eyes closed, and Xander and Cordelia looked at her with an amused look on their faces.</p>
<p>'You're being stared at.'</p>
<p>Buffy opened her eyes and caught her friends' gazes. &#34;What?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Nothing.nothing at all.&#34; Xander and Cordelia said in rambling defense.</p>
<p>She sat up. &#34;I like Willow warmth. And we had to sit through you two feeding each other grapes, you know.&#34; She looked at the empty soda cans around them, and noticed a bottle sticking out of the basket. &#34;Is that champagne, Xander?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No. It's ginger ale. I took the label off.&#34; Cordelia gave him her best 'you're impossible' look.</p>
<p>Willow had to keep from laughing. It was nice to see them in rare form again. &#34;So, things are better.with you guys?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Ooh! Yeah. I'm working at the Bronze now.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Really? Doing what?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Bouncer.&#34; Buffy cleared her throat. &#34;Does the Slayer have something she'd like to say?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I just.never thought of you as a bouncer before, is all.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;If it's about the lack of muscle, believe me, I'm making him bulk up.&#34; Cordelia said.</p>
<p>&#34;Before my maleness gets attacked some more, allow me to explain. Most people refuse to take the job, because.most people die.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Which leads me to add - why did you take this job?&#34; Willow asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Hey I can handle the run of the mill vamps, and because I was so enthusiastic, they're willing to pay me a nice chunk of change.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I'm happy for you. Really. Just promise me, because I know how important this is to you, that you'll arm yourself?&#34; Buffy said.</p>
<p>&#34;To the teeth. Promise.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And I called most of the colleges I applied to. They said I could take the summer session, and they're sending me financial aid things, and I'm learning to save my money, so.&#34; Cordelia said.</p>
<p>&#34;That's great. So which one are you going to go to?&#34; Willow asked. Cordelia looked down at her lap. &#34;I shouldn't have asked that. Being quiet now.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;She's just not sure.yet.&#34; Xander said, looking at Cordelia to make sure he was correct. She nodded. &#34;So.Buffy, how are you feeling?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Good. Almost a hundred percent even. I can take on anything the Hellmouth throws out.&#34;</p>
<p>Just then, they all felt the sand move underneath their blanket. They all jumped off, and watched as oddly colored, red spiked snakes slithered out from the blanket. They made their way to the ocean, quickly.</p>
<p>Xander rushed to one, and stepped on its head, killing it. He picked it up, and the rest allowed the ocean to carry them away.</p>
<p>&#34;Caught one.&#34; He said.</p>
<p>&#34;What were they?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>Cordelia sighed. &#34;Not again.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy faced her, and noticed Willow and Xander fidgeting. &#34;Again?&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Giles and Wesley were sitting quietly drinking tea and reading, when Buffy and the others came in. Wesley had learned that Angelus was somewhere underground and that had shocked them, because Angelus didn't seem like someone who would live in filth. They had not gone in search of him yet.</p>
<p>They were waiting for him to show himself. Wandering aimlessly in the sewers looking for him would not have been a very good or smart thing, to do.</p>
<p>&#34;Did you have,&#34; Giles started to say when Buffy put the snake on the table, &#34;a good time?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Don't hurt him, Buffy.&#34; Willow said, coming up behind her.</p>
<p>Wesley was drawn to the snake immediately, and picked it up. &#34;You were actually able to capture one this time. Excellent.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You can thank me for -&#34; Xander began.</p>
<p>&#34;What's been going on, Giles?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Ah.recently.&#34; He looked up at anyone for help, but they all raised their hands and sat down on the couch. &#34;There have been creatures appearing from time to time.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Why didn't you tell me?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;They haven't been anything terribly life-threatening, and I didn't want to worry you over -&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy's expression softened. &#34;Giles, I know you're looking out for me,&#34; She grabbed his hand, &#34;and I appreciate it, really. But I'm not going to break. I'm fully functional, and ready to slay. And if these things have shown up more than once, we need to figure out why.&#34;</p>
<p>He smiled at her. &#34;I suppose my parental instincts have been outdoing my watcher instincts lately.&#34;</p>
<p>She hugged him. &#34;I'm glad they are. But.I do have a job to do.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Now that I have a closer look, I believe I recognize this creature.&#34; Wesley said.</p>
<p>&#34;And?&#34; Cordelia asked.</p>
<p>Buffy backed into Willow's embrace, and they and everyone else turned to him for an explanation.</p>
<p>&#34;It's a Vyerdin. An ancient, demonic ancestor of today's snake breeds. It hasn't existed on Earth for thousands of years. It poisons -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Poison?&#34; Xander and Cordelia panicked.</p>
<p>Xander pulled off his shoe and his sock and checked his foot for punctures.</p>
<p>&#34;Which it releases from its tail. If you only impacted with its head, you should be fine.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I think I almost had a heart attack.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Breathe.&#34; Cordelia said.</p>
<p>&#34;The next question - what are they doing here after a thousand years?&#34; Willow asked.</p>
<p>&#34;I have no idea.&#34; Wesley said.</p>
<p>&#34;I was waiting for the brick wall. Here it is.&#34; Buffy said.</p>
<p>&#34;Now, when it comes to demons and stuff, I'm no expert, but it seems like every time we've seen these things, they've come up from under the ground.&#34; Cordelia said.</p>
<p>Everyone's brains started working.</p>
<p>&#34;And what's underground?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Sewers?&#34; Xander offered.</p>
<p>&#34;And?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Angelus.&#34; Willow said.</p>
<p>&#34;Can we go three for three?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Damn.&#34; Wesley cursed.</p>
<p>&#34;The Hellmouth.&#34; Giles said. &#34;It's at its weakest point directly underneath where the school was, so the Vyerdin are breaking through, and if Angelus is residing in the sewers.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;He's getting ready to open it.&#34; Xander said.</p>
<p>Their adrenaline was going; their hearts were beating faster, their blood pumping, anxiety rising.</p>
<p>&#34;So what do we do?&#34; Cordelia asked.</p>
<p>They just looked at one another. What were they going to do?</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>In a restricted wing of the Council's complex, Quentin Travers went to report to the founder of the institution. The boss. No matter how powerful Quentin was, his boss' orders were final. And they weren't always &#34;good&#34; orders.</p>
<p>The &#34;right of passage&#34; test that Slayers had to endure, though most didn't, was started by the founder. Except for the current slayer, of course. As much as people over the years of had objected to it, nothing changed, because the test was not to improve the slayer, it was to kill her. Which is what the founder wanted. Rupert had been right when he said it was barbaric, but Quentin didn't have a choice.</p>
<p>What most watchers and slayers didn't know, was that the very forces that they were trying to combat, started the Council. On the surface, the Council seemed to have good intentions, but it was all a sham. The darker forces used the whole idea of enlisting girls with slaying ability, to keep an eye on the enemy, and evil could fool even the most suspicious of people into thinking it was something it wasn't.</p>
<p>When the time came, when evil was to gain the upper hand once again, it could simply shut down the only organized threat to it. The Council. They trained their slayers and watchers to follow orders to the letter. Drones who would follow orders without question. So when everything was brought to a halt, they would simply disband, and no one would oppose them.</p>
<p>But, occasionally, rebellious types would spring up. Normally, they'd be taken care of quickly, but in the case of Buffy Summers and her Watcher, they had proved more resilient. And now that the Great Sorceress had been discovered, and she and the Slayer had joined forces, things had become complicated.</p>
<p>They had not anticipated a struggle, but it was Hell's time to reclaim Earth, and according to the boss, they wouldn't be stopped.</p>
<p>Quentin entered the large, dark chamber, and stood patiently.</p>
<p>&#34;Travers.&#34; A deep voice said in the shadows.</p>
<p>&#34;Yes?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;My brethren call to me. The time is near.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I understand.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I also understand that you let the man, Pryce, leave with materials to aid the light warriors.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No, of course not.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Your tongue is lying. If it hadn't been for your meddling, the takeover would have been quick. Now, the Great Sorceress grows stronger, and the Slayer is powerful once again. Penance must be paid.&#34; Quentin was silent, as beads of sweat ran down his face.</p>
<p>&#34;Have you nothing to say in your defense? I have watched over this place for thousands of years - at the request of my brothers in the Dark Dimension. Confined here, paving the way for our eventual triumph. It's so very near, and I will be free to roam this plane.</p>
<p>&#34;Thousands will die in the reshaping of this world. Horrors the human eye will be frightened to look upon. Take solace in the fact, that you, will not have to see it.&#34;</p>
<p>Before Quentin knew what was happening, red eyes appeared in the darkness, and less than a second later, he was ash on the floor.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;I don't,&#34; Buffy punched the vampire she was battling in the gut, &#34;have time,&#34; she kicked it in the head and it fell on its back, &#34;for idiots,&#34; she staked it, &#34;like you.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow was magically thrusting a vampire in the air, and with a wave of her hand, threw it into a branch jutting out from a tree. &#34;Is that it?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You're showing off.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Am not. Just using what I'm good at. Never thought I'd be able to be good at doing, that, though. Would it help if I said I was just trying to impress you?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It might.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Okay that was twenty five percent showing off, fifty percent trying to see if I could do it and pushing myself, and twenty five percent impressing you.&#34;</p>
<p>Buffy walked over to her, and crossed her arms over her chest. &#34;I only get twenty-five percent?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You have all my percents in every other area. Promise.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Magick is your deal, so I guess I can let you off the hook. What does that mean anyway? Are they talking about fishing hooks, or phone hooks or what?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I've always wondered what the heck 'Yabba Dabba Doo' meant.&#34; Buffy gave her a strange look and started to laugh. &#34;What?&#34; Willow stuck her tongue out at her. &#34;I like the Flintstones. I know he says it when he's happy. They're three separate words, though. I wanna know what they mean.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It's a mystery for the ages. Actually, it was the sixties. They were probably all on drugs. Look at Scooby Doo.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I know what you mean.wait. We got completely sidetracked, didn't we?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Uh huh. Side tracking is nice sometimes. But focusing. Must focus.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Especially because of what Xander and Oz are gonna do. You think they'll be okay?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;They volunteered, and everybody has to chip in, no matter how much we don't like it. Oz is sensible, and Xander's impulsive. They balance out. I just hope they don't take any risks.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Giles is supposed to call to tell us what they find out.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Then let's go play the waiting game.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>Xander was standing beside the entrance to the Bronze accepting the price of admission from incoming clubgoers. He figured he must've had five hundred dollars in his pockets. Of course, he didn't get to keep any of it, but holding that amount of money was a thrilling experience for him. Plus he got to card people. He'd know everybody in Sunnydale eventually.</p>
<p>He had a zipped up jacket on. Not because it was cold, but for other reasons. One was to hide his lack of muscular build, so he could retain some menacing demeanor, and two, he was hiding vampire protection materials. Mainly, a couple strands of garlic, a large cross, and a few bottles of holywater.</p>
<p>He thought he noticed people smelling the garlic scent, because they were looking at him with bizarre expressions. He glanced over at Oz, who was similarly equipped, standing in the shadows across the street. This had been a bad idea.</p>
<p>Well, not necessarily a bad idea. Just one that probably could have used a little more planning on their part. They were looking for any sign of Angelus. The guy had to come out to eat, and the Bronze was in the center of town. They were hoping to see him, and then follow him to where he was holed up, get out, and then tell everyone.</p>
<p>That was what Xander wasn't too keen on doing. But he had asked, volunteered, so he had to stick with it. Besides, it was simple reconnaissance. See where Angelus was, try and see what he was doing, and get out. Quick, fast, and pain free. Or so he hoped.</p>
<p>There was no sign of him yet apparently, because he saw Oz shake his head.</p>
<p>And then Xander saw him out of the corner of his eye. Angelus was coming out of an alley, wiping what Xander assumed was blood, off his mouth.</p>
<p>&#34;Damn.&#34; He said quietly. But there wasn't anything he or Oz could have done.</p>
<p>Then Angelus made his way toward a manhole up the street. He had to go. But he had his job. Why hadn't he factored that in? Then the manager came out of the club.</p>
<p>&#34;I'm getting complaints from people about a smell. Is that garlic?&#34; The man asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Sorry. Superticious. Tell you what. I'll go home, get rid of it, take a shower, and come back here.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Make it quick.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Twenty minutes tops. Just.don't fire me.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I like you, kid.&#34; Xander smiled inwardly. He was on good terms with his boss. That was a first. He was about to catch up with Oz and follow Angelus, when he felt the manager tap him on the shoulder. &#34;The money?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Whoops. Unintentional.&#34; He handed over the money and started to run.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;To quote a great man, 'The waiting game sucks.'&#34; Buffy said, as both she and Willow were sitting on their bed staring at the phone.</p>
<p>&#34;Who said that?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Beats me. Had to be great, though. Cause this does suck.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;They're fine. I'm sure they are.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Can you tell?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Just that they're not hurt.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;That's good. Wow. Is there a limit to what you can do?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I hope so. Being able to do some of things she taught me -&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;The Goddess?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Yeah. It's freaky. Mostly cause I can do stuff without even concentrating that hard anymore. Before the year started I could lift a pencil, and the biggest spell I did was barely making a five second duplicate of you.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;That seems like forever ago.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;So much.a lot.has happened.&#34;</p>
<p>Willow was becoming overwhelmed as she realized the scope of what she had been through. And then realized, that this was what happened when you stood between the world and its destruction. In her hacker/sidekick helper position, she had never fully understood. But Buffy knew. All too well. Just another reason for Willow to respect her.</p>
<p>&#34;But we're still here. My mom, you're parents, Giles, is still here. Everyone's still alive. This is the Buffy statement on slaying - 'If you've survived, didn't lose any friends, and manage to stay enrolled in school, you're doing pretty damn good.'</p>
<p>&#34;For someone new to this, you're really good at it. And I still think you're the greatest person in the world, still love ya, and you get bonus points for being so wiccany.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It doesn't bother you that you're sharing your slaying with me is it?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You kidding? It's a major help. It used to be just me out there, even though you guys helped some. And then it was Kendra, Faith.now it's you. And I'm glad. Really.</p>
<p>&#34;The only thing that scares me is the track record of people who slay with me, hasn't been so good. Kendra ended up dead, and Faith is in comaland. Which.I won't let happen.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;That goes for me too, you know. If I'm slaying, I take on as much responsibility to watch your back as you do for me.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I wouldn't want anyone else to be watching it.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You better not.&#34;</p>
<p>They laughed, trying to break the seriousness of the moment, and Buffy brought her hand to Willow's cheek and quickly kissed her lips.</p>
<p>&#34;We've gotta stop having these heavy conversations. Especially with our friends out there. It's not good for my stress level.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You know what we need?&#34;</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door, and Buffy got up to answer it, leaving Willow's question hanging in the air. Cordelia was standing there, holding a carton in her hands. She came in immediately.</p>
<p>&#34;I was driving Giles and Wesley nuts.I was driving myself nuts.so I came over here. I have ice cream.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Kind?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Fudge nut brownie.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;That's what we need.&#34; Willow said, answering her own question.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;The barrier is weakening. You're progressing well.&#34; The cloaked figure said to Angelus in the Master's lair. His ability to connect to the world was becoming stronger.</p>
<p>Around the room, black candles were lit, an eerie, blue flame washing the walls in light. There was a smell of incense in the air, and the Vyerdin were slithering about, looking for escape.</p>
<p>&#34;These things are getting on my nerves.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Get used to it. When the Mouth is fully opened, a lot of larger 'things', as you put it, will be coming through.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;That's great, really, but while I'm down here lighting candles, Buffy, and Willow, are getting better. Stronger. Not to mention the fact that they're still breathing.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;And whose fault, is that?&#34; Angelus didn't answer. &#34;Your problem is lack of patience. They will die. It's inevitable.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You haven't faced them. It's easy to talk. She's not the same as she was three years ago.&#34; He was careful not to lash out at the figure.</p>
<p>&#34;Which is why there will be reinforcements.&#34;</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;Who's he talking to?&#34; Xander asked in a whisper.</p>
<p>They followed Angelus discreetly and quietly, and were surprised that he hadn't sensed them. But seeing his agitation and distraction now, they could understand why. Needless to say, Xander was shocked when they saw the Master's lair in use again.</p>
<p>&#34;I dunno. You know this place better than I do.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;No idea. We've seen enough.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Agreed.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Let's go report.&#34;</p>
<p>That's when Angelus looked in their general direction, and they heard the figure speak.</p>
<p>&#34;It seems you have company. Although, I wouldn't -&#34; Angelus was already on his way over.</p>
<p>&#34;Xander, Xander, Xander. Don't you ever learn?&#34;</p>
<p>He and Oz opened their jackets, revealing their hidden defenses.</p>
<p>&#34;Yes.&#34; Xander said. He poured holywater over the backing up Angelus, and they took the opportunity to run. &#34;We'll tell Buffy you said hi.&#34;</p>
<p>Angelus grabbed his face. The garlic, cross, and holywater combination had burned the side of his face.</p>
<p>&#34;I tried to warn you.&#34; The figure said. &#34;Impulsive and impatient. I pushed for your release. More and more, I question whether that was a mistake.&#34; It vanished.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;I suppose I should have suspected something. Angelus' single focus has always been Buffy's demise. For him to suddenly stop, disappear, was strange.&#34; Giles said.</p>
<p>&#34;As you mentioned, your mind was elsewhere.&#34; Wesley replied.</p>
<p>&#34;You find that irresponsible.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I find that caring. I was honest when I said I wanted to see Buffy well when I came here. You and Buffy and her friends have influenced me greatly. I may not understand the depth of your caring for her or any of these kids, but I wouldn't penalize you for it. I envy you, actually.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;The Council doesn't allow for that. You were just following regulations.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Perhaps I shouldn't have. I feel I've missed opportunities, some more fulfilling type of life.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Better late than never. You could start now.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I think I will. I owe you all thanks.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;You've done so much for Buffy and for Willow, and have helped us all tremendously. You don't owe anyone.&#34;</p>
<p>The phone started to ring, and Giles picked it up immediately.</p>
<p>&#34;Oz? Are you two all right.good.really?.he went back to.okay then. Thank you.this helps. Get some sleep.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;Safe?&#34;</p>
<p>Giles nodded, hung up, and started to dial the number for Buffy and Willow's dorm.</p>
<hr width=100>
<p>&#34;Great, Giles. Good night.&#34; Willow said, and then hung up. &#34;They're both fine.&#34;</p>
<p>All three girls took a deep breath.</p>
<p>&#34;So what'd they learn?&#34; Buffy asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Giles didn't say much except that Angelus was in the Master's lair and that he'd talk to us after classes tomorrow.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;The Master's lair? Why there?&#34; Cordelia asked.</p>
<p>&#34;Beats me.&#34; Buffy said. But her thoughts betrayed her voice.</p>
<p>'The Master's lair. You don't think.'</p>
<p>'No way.he's dead Buffy. Completely.'</p>
<p>'Still. He could've picked anywhere. So what if the Hellmouth's a little more weaker there.'</p>
<p>'Relax. It'll be okay.'</p>
<p>Willow hugged Buffy to her. Cordelia looked at them.</p>
<p>&#34;Willow warmth again?&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;It's comforting.&#34; Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>But just the thought that the only person, well not really a person, who had killed her, could have something to do with everything that was happening.she shuddered, and Willow held tighter.</p>
