<!-- Someone Different \ Part 1 -->

<p>"Okay, was that as lame as I thought it was? I mean, I'll be the first to admit that I'm not exactly up-to-date on the ways of Wicca, so I could be off base, but I'm gonna guess that that wasn't what you were hoping for." Buffy said to Willow as they walked down the hall towards their dorm room.</p>
<p>The aspiring witch had asked the slayer to come with her to a Wicca group meeting that had been held on campus. Ever since Oz left, having someone around helped her to not focus on him; her friend readily agreed, despite magick not being her interest or forte. She'd hoped that she could find something productive that would occupy her time, but the forty-five minutes she took out of her life was a huge disappointment.</p>
<p>"Understatement of the century. It was talk - all talk. Magickally savvy witches? I think not." The redhead muttered. "Blah, blah...Gaia...Blah, blah...moon...menstrual, life-force power thingy. They're just a bunch of wanna blessed bees." She frowned. "You know, nowadays every girl with a Henna tattoo and a spice rack thinks she's a sister to the dark ones."</p>
<p>They reached the door to their room, and entered.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm sorry it was a bust. I know you were looking to go farther in that department." The blonde was sympathetic. "But what about that one girl?"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Tara, remember? She seemed to wanna back you up. Why don't you check her out, see if she's the real deal?"</p>
<p>It took the redhead a second, but a face was put to the name as she sat on her bed. Tara. Yeah, she did seem different than the rest of them. Buffy handed her a soda she'd gotten from their mini-fridge, and sat down with her.</p>
<p>"Oh...yeah, I could. She was pretty shy, though."</p>
<p>"And it's not like you were *ever* that way." The sarcasm was laid on pretty thick, and her friend grinned slightly. "Anyway, she was probably just afraid she'd get laughed at."</p>
<p>They'd both been there before. The slayer got the impression that Tara was an out-of-towner (well, she didn't recognize her from high school), and she could see why the fellow blonde would want to keep her mouth shut and avoid becoming an outcast. It was a shame; hiding who you were was an all too familiar theme. Reading people was a talent that had become second nature to her, and when she looked at Tara, Buffy saw another side just dying to come out.</p>
<p>She looked at her for almost the entire meeting, drowning the words out. When the girl saw her staring, she felt embarrassed. Having a stranger leering at you couldn't be a comfortable thing; and when did she start leering at strangers? Girl strangers? She was going to focus on the discussion, but then this stranger locked eyes with her, and it wasn't like anything she'd ever experienced before. It was instantaneous, and the sensation was somewhat familiar, she just couldn't place it.</p>
<p>Only when Willow had something to say did the trance break, and they blinked for several moments, trying to clear their heads. She found out her name when the person running the meeting called for quiet to allow her to speak. Tara. She waited for her to defend Willow, but all the attention directed her way seemed to make her nervous. Tara just shook her head, and Buffy's heart broke, as it was doing for Willow now.</p>
<p>"Like I did." The hacker slumped her shoulders.</p>
<p>"Will, they're stupid, you're not." Buffy put her arm around them. "Am I speaking Chinese? Do I need to find a translator to get the message across? Cause if it has to come to that, then we have problems."</p>
<p>She smiled gratefully, shaking her head. "I'd just like to float something bigger than a pencil someday." Willow sighed, and then the smile was back, as she wondered how her little matchmaking attempt was working out. "Hey, how's with you and Riley?"</p>
<p>"We're with nothing." Buffy smirked. "Give it up, girl. He's not in consideration."</p>
<p>"Aw, come on, Buffy. I need my vicarious smoochies."</p>
<p>"Try being social with Xander and Anya."</p>
<p>The redhead made a face. "Ugh. No thank you. Definitely gonna hafta pass there." When did Xander lose his mind? "But you will be kissing somebody before the year's over; that's a promise."</p>
<p>"Don't hold your breath...and, wait a minute. What about you?"</p>
<p>"Uh uh, no way. Situations like this have a system of rules. The most important? Cause your boyfriend left first, I, as your friend, have to set you up first. I'm a non-budger with rules. Once you're all 'date-ho' again, then we'll worry about me. If...if I'm ready and all."</p>
<p>"Good luck." The blonde said, meaning it. If Willow was successful, it meant good things for her. "Hey, if Tara's really into witchcraft, you should tell her she can hang around with us. Maybe she'll wanna join the group and there can be a vote or an initiation or something. She'd know about demons and stuff, right? It's just...she looked like she could use a few friends, and misfits have to stick together."</p>
<p>An expression of confusion formed on Willow's face, but she shrugged. "K, sure."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"What, what?"</p>
<p>Buffy cocked an eyebrow. "Whatever."</p>

<hr>

<p>There was nothing like losing your vocal chords to make you appreciate them. Everything else had passed through Sunnydale, so why not fairytale monsters called "the Gentlemen" who stole people's hearts and voices? Willow had finally caught up with Tara during the extended period of silence, and they had helped each other out, using their combined magickal strengths to move a vending machine in front of a door, protecting them from attack. The blonde was definitely the genuine article.</p>
<p>The two wiccas walked into the lounge the following day. Shy was an understatement when describing Tara; Willow couldn't ever remember being as reserved as her fellow practioner. Even as they found seats, she managed to somehow duck behind her hair, and she had a tendency to stutter. It was kind of cute, but also kind of sad. The redhead could see why Buffy noticed her, though. The slayer was always able to appreciate someone's oddness from minute one; able to know that somewhere underneath the quirkiness was a good person.</p>
<p>Willow knew that first-hand, but generally Buffy wasn't that enthusiastic over someone who didn't speak much, very often. With Tara she was, though. At least that's how it appeared to her; she could've been wrong. The last time that happened was when they all first knew Angel - he'd say two words and disappear, but Buffy still swooned. There was no swooning with Tara, was there? No, there couldn't be. In the redhead's opinion, it was just a lot of unexpected interest. Weird no doubt, but she told Buffy she'd talk to the girl, so she would.</p>
<p>"You were there looking for me?" She asked Tara.</p>
<p>"I thought maybe we could do a spell, make people talk again? I-I'd seen you in the group - the w-wicca group? You were...you were different than them. I mean, they didn't seem to know -"</p>
<p>"What they were talking about?" She laughed lightly.</p>
<p>"I think if they saw a w-witch they would, um...run the other way." The girl joked with a smile, and nervous laugh. "Uh, t-that girl, you were...sitting next to, is she your f-friend?"</p>
<p>"Who, Buffy? Yeah, my best friend; but she's not a witch. She has...other hobbies."</p>
<p>Willow wasn't sure, but she thought that was relief on Tara's face.</p>
<p>"Like what?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you know, girly stuff. Shopping, cheesy romance movies, and...kickboxing."</p>
<p>"Kickboxing?" The girl's eyebrows furrowed.</p>
<p>"Buffy's big on self-defense. Sunnydale's a scary place." She didn't like being put on the spot; she wasn't a great secret-keeper. "She's real strong; I think it drives potential boyfriends away. Guys get all huffy and macho." She scowled. "If I sound bitter, it's cause I sorta am. We're recent dumpees."</p>
<p>The explanation was lame, but it would have to do.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry." Tara frowned.</p>
<p>"Thanks. We're coping okay, but when we run out of ice cream, it won't be pretty."</p>
<p>Why did she expect this girl she'd just met to care about their problems?</p>
<p>"You're really nice. I'm sure you and Buffy'll both...find n-new people." Tara got quiet. "And with the power you guys have -"</p>
<p>"Me? Powerful? Nooo." She got smiled at again. "Just Buffy. But come and eat lunch with us sometime - you can meet her."</p>
<p>"Oh, um, I dunno...I wouldn't wanna get...in t-the way..."</p>
<p>"She wants to meet you."</p>
<p>"S-she does?" Her smile got wider. "She s-said that?"</p>
<p>"Uh huh." Willow was amused. "So how long have you been practicing?"</p>

<hr>

<p>'Perfect.'  Tara thought as she went into her dorm the next day.</p>
<p>Why was she always attracted to the wrong people? Boys, they liked boys. Buffy liked boys. At least she knew that now instead of later; she didn't have any chance whatsoever. And even if sexuality wasn't an issue, it wasn't like she'd get very far. She couldn't talk without tripping over her own words, she wasn't that interesting (she wasn't funny, either, and that was a serious disadvantage), and she didn't know what it was, but she felt like Buffy was special. They both were cool, and she knew she liked Willow, but when she saw Buffy in the meeting, she just couldn't look away.</p>
<p>Anyway, they were cool, she wasn't. At all.</p>
<p>The blonde witch searched for a spell book. She needed a distraction, needed to hole herself in her room, just like she did back home. She left to start fresh, to get away from her overbearing family. It hadn't worked yet; she was too afraid. How was she supposed to get friends, gain confidence, if she stayed afraid? Her conversation with Willow was the most she'd spoken since she'd arrived in town, and her mom was the only one who'd ever been encouraging. Unfortunately, the woman had gone.</p>
<p>If she had believed the things her mother told her, maybe things would be different. It was pathetic; she was pathetic. But she was invited to lunch, wasn't she? Buffy wanted to meet her, right? That was good. Though that didn't matter, because what would happen if she really started to like her? It wouldn't turn out well - especially because of what was inside of her. It'd be better if she remained in her bubble; no one got hurt that way. She'd adjust to the solitary life sooner or later. All she had to get was a few animals, and then she could live her life in peace.</p>
<p>'So your big goal is to become one of those lonely, crazy ladies with fifty cats?'</p>
<p>"They're not crazy. They're sweet, and a l-little eccentric." She argued with herself.</p>
<p>'Or they're nuts. And you can pretend like the words don't all mean the same thing if you want, but it doesn't change the fact that they do. You learn that in reality, Tara.'</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know." She sighed, giving in, when there was a knock at her door. Not believing that someone would want to visit her, it took a second for her to answer the door. "Hel -"</p>
<p>Buffy and Willow were standing in the hallway.</p>
<p>"Let's go. You're coming to lunch, and if we stand here, it just keeps getting later and later. Time's wacky that way. Before you know it, dinner'll be here." The slayer announced, she and her friend taking an arm each and dragging her with them. "Maybe Willow should've made the offer more clear. It wasn't optional."</p>
<p>"Buffy, Tara; Tara, Buffy." Willow introduced them.</p>
<p>"H-hi."</p>
<p>"Hey."</p>
<p>'Wow. This is new.'</p>

<hr>

<p>The trio of females sat in the college's food court, two of them eating unhealthy, grease-covered meals, the other sticking to a salad topped with a light amount of Thousand Island dressing. Tara ate less when she was nervous; her stomach couldn't handle anything too heavy. They were on the subject of magick now, though, and it was a calming subject. She kept discreetly glancing at Buffy, not wanting to be obvious about it, and wondering if what she and Willow were saying was being followed. The last thing she wanted to do was be rude.</p>
<p>Was the petite blonde comprehending? Not really.</p>
<p>It wasn't like there was no attempt to, but Buffy was out of her element - the blank look was a dead giveaway. Here they were talking about spells and twenty different kinds of warts, and all she could contribute were ointment suggestions. Willow had found herself a partner to learn from, and even though she was happy for her, the slayer still wanted to be in on the discussion. The more complicated the words got, the further distanced she became. She didn't completely understand why that bugged her, but it did.</p>
<p>Willow had been doing spells for the past year and a half, and when they came to that topic during conversations, being able to only absorb every other sentence hadn't bothered her. Her friend would let her know what was a positive thing so she could be congratulatory, and what was a negative thing, so she could cheer her up; it was a reliable system. Now she was just lost. Couldn't they veer off back into the land of generality? The witches were going to spend plenty of spell-casting time together - this was her hour.</p>
<p>She was the one who told Willow to invite Tara to lunch in the first place. Why did she want to sound interesting and knowledgeable to the new girl? She hadn't exactly thought that through. Still, if this went on any longer, she was going to start to fidget. There had to be something that was on par with magick in the attention-grabbing department. Something that would make her appear intelligent. As Tara turned to look at her for what seemed like the umpteenth time and gave her that cute half-smile/half-grin, she thought of it, unable to stop herself from blurting out -</p>
<p>"I'm a vampire slayer."</p>
<p>She didn't believe in secrets, anyway.</p>

<hr>

<p>The witches made the slayer go to the magick shop with them after they'd all finished eating, which just added to the "outsider" feeling she was already experiencing. Considering that Tara called the owner by name as they walked into the building, Buffy deduced that the girl must know her craft, and would steer her clear of poisonous things, amulets that would transport her to some inescapable demon dimension, or rarely heard of animal parts.</p>
<p>The blondes stuck together, and the redhead went off to search on her own, coming back at random moments to show her fellow wicca various objects. She wanted to let them talk, and they were. Buffy didn't know whether Tara was humoring or not, asking her about vampires' weaknesses (they were the things any good, monster flick got right), though she was glad for it after that rather one-sided lunch, which caused her IQ to plummet several numbers down the scale.</p>
<p>"Stakes, fire, beheading, sunlight - there's your big four ways to kill 'em. Actually, I think that's the only four. If I wasn't cheated out of that handbook..." The slayer was saying.</p>
<p>"There's a-a handbook?" Tara's interest was piqued.</p>
<p>"That's the rumor." She muttered. "Anyway, if you just want to injure or distract, there's crosses, holywater, and garlic." Her forehead creased. "You know what? I don't think I've ever put garlic to the test. Too smelly."</p>
<p>"Then you d-don't wanna open this." The witch inspected a jar, read the label 'Gabroth Exc.,' then showed it to Buffy and set it back down.</p>
<p>"Is 'Exc.' short for what I think it's short for?"</p>
<p>"Uh huh."</p>
<p>The slayer looked revolted. "Eew. How can you do spells with that stuff?"</p>
<p>"Outside. On-on a very windy day." Tara grinned.</p>
<p>Buffy chuckled, and picked up a bag filled with what appeared to be leaves. "What's this?"</p>
<p>"Uh, G-Ginkgo. It helps with memory...st-stimulates the brain."</p>
<p>"No kidding? This would come in handy. It doesn't make courses any more interesting, does it?" The girl's amused look told her it didn't. "Somebody should sell this in drink-form at like, supermarkets and make a fortune."</p>
<p>"They already do. Health drinks h-have it in them."</p>
<p>"Oh. Right." And the IQ hit bottom. "I was...just testing you."</p>
<p>"The leaves don't really have any major m-magickal properties," Tara explained, "b-but people just starting out sometimes think they do, so Mr. Bogarty p-puts them up for sale to make more money. They're good in tea, though."</p>
<p>"So it's like a magick placebo." Buffy realized.</p>
<p>"Exactly."</p>
<p>"And you were ready to give up on me." The pleased slayer said aloud to her brain.</p>
<p>"Give up on you?" The wicca asked, confusedly.</p>
<p>Normal people thought quietly. "Ignore me."</p>
<p>"Why w-would I wanna do that?" Tara wondered seriously, which made Buffy smile broadly. "Vampires - can they t-turn into bats?"</p>
<p>"Nope, and if they did, my hair would be gray right now. Purely a movie invention." The slayer revealed. "Can you imagine me running around a graveyard with a net trying to catch the damn things?"</p>
<p>Tara giggled. She could, and it was a funny image. Willow made her way over to them then, seeing the bags of Gingko leaves.</p>
<p>"Ooh. Great, I need more of these." The redhead announced, happily. The blondes exchanged knowing grins. "What?"</p>

<hr>

<p>"Giles!" Buffy yelled, barging through his front door later that night after patrol. "I wanna learn about magick!"</p>
<p>"Excuse me?" The ex-watcher said, looking up from the book he was reading.</p>
<p>"I need one of those." She pointed to it. "The thing with the pages. Only it has to be about magick, not..." She stood in front of the sofa and titled her head to the side so she could see the title. "...'How to Basket Weave'?"</p>
<p>"Right." He stuffed the book behind a pillow. "Uh, any particular area?"</p>
<p>"History, I guess. Just your basic, general info. Unless ya want me bippity-boppity-booing stuff. Hey, I'll try anything once."</p>
<p>"I'd rather you not." He said with a cough.</p>
<p>"Thought so." She smiled, putting her hands behind her back.</p>
<p>"Let me see what I have."</p>
<p>"Great. Thanks."</p>
<p>"Why the sudden interest?" He asked as he got up to scour his collection.</p>
<p>"Why the sudden interest in becoming the male, Martha Stewart?" She was answered with a stern, English glare. "What? Is there something wrong with a girl wanting to expand her mystical horizons? Wanting to grasp new and exciting concepts?"</p>
<p>"No, of course not. But past experience has shown me that you're not the type to pursue knowledge...outside of a formal, academic setting."</p>
<p>Giles was right, but she wasn't going to admit that out loud. She had come away from the lunch and the shopping trip wanting to study magick and its background, because wanted to be able to relate to Tara. She wasn't going to deny that it was because of the girl, but questioning why the witch had made such an impression on her had taken her nowhere so far. It came down to this, she guessed: whatever happened in that meeting hadn't faded away, and...well, there was just something about her. It was different; being around Tara felt different. In a good way. It sure didn't feel bad. She liked her right off the bat.</p>
<p>But her father figure didn't have to know all that.</p>
<p>"Could that be any more British? You Americanize, then you revert. Your girlfriend's a bad influence; pick a flag to salute and stick with it." Two glares in less than five minutes - she was proud. "Just say what you mean in 'normal person language' for once. You don't think I'm a go-getter when it comes to filling up my brain with...with..."</p>
<p>"Facts?" Giles supplied.</p>
<p>"Yeah, those! I got into college, didn't I?"</p>
<p>"And sometimes I still find myself wondering how." Her mouth hung open. "You could have asked Willow for assistance."</p>
<p>"I'm thinking that would've been a better idea. If I'd a known that I was gonna interrupt 'Basket Weaving 101'..." She laid her arms across her chest. "Do you have some or not?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Hang on." He turned to her, looking a tad concerned. "Are you all right? You seem somewhat distracted."</p>
<p>"I am *not* distracted." She responded adamantly. "It's assumptions like that that get people turned into demons."</p>
<p>A glare hat trick; she was on tonight. "My mistake."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"Man..." Buffy muttered leaving her English professor's office the next afternoon.</p>
<p>She had pulled a muscle in her back the previous night while slaying, but the pain hadn't yet taken effect when she was demanding books from Giles. And she didn't dare tell him about her little mishap, because he just would've made her train more. She'd been coping well, but having to run at high speed to deliver a paper on time, aggravated the area. That distraction coupled with lack of sleep because she was up late perusing a chapter on the basic points of Wicca, caused her to bump into Tara in the hallway.</p>
<p>'Brilliant, Summers. Injure the girl. What a nice message you're sending. You'll give her a complex.'</p>
<p>Thankfully, her slayer reflexes enabled her to keep the witch from falling, and she latched onto her arms until Tara got her balance back.</p>
<p>"Hey, Tara...and sorry." She apologized, wincing. "Am I the only one who wants this day to be over?"</p>
<p>"Did you have a late paper, too?" Tara asked, noticing her discomfort.</p>
<p>"Oh, you have no idea how much that just cheered me up." The slayer smiled slightly. "But do you know a cure for back pain? It's not cooperating with its buddies, 'The Other Parts of Buffy's Body.'" Tara opened her mouth, but the other blonde kept going. "Sworn duty? Who needs it? If anyone ever comes up to you and tells you you're a vampire slayer, run to Cuba and become a Communist. Sure, fighting the forces of darkness sounds glamorous, but it's all an illusion. With no dental plan."</p>
<p>"I'll r-remember that." The wicca said, replaying the mini-rant in her head. "I think."</p>
<p>"Be sure you do."</p>
<p>Tara chewed on her lip, unsure of what this was going to get her into. "I-I could probably...I m-mean, if you mix the right herbs and in-ingredients and rub it into where it hurts...it loosens and r-relaxes the muscle."</p>
<p>"It's my lower back. I can't really reach it."</p>
<p>"Oh." Tara swallowed. "W-well, did you want me to do it for you? Back in m-my dorm. I have everything there. Or -"</p>
<p>"If that's a massage offer, I'm *all* for it. Lead the way, but...slowly?"</p>
<p>During that slow walk, Buffy's mind wandered, contemplating what she'd assented to. This was simply going to be an alleviation of pain at the hands of a friend, right? No big deal. Then again, her back was preventing rational thought. Crossing into Tara's room, Buffy smiled. The lights were pretty, and it was a decently sized living space. It felt lonely, though.</p>
<p>"Nice. Do you have a roommate?" She asked.</p>
<p>"No, I don't k-know why they didn't give me one." Tara answered, going to raid her supplies.</p>
<p>"Least you can do what you want without anybody asking questions."</p>
<p>"Yeah, m-most of the time I like that." The other times she wished she had somebody besides herself in the room. Like now. "You can l-lay down on the b-bed, if..."</p>
<p>Buffy wasted no time; she was lying face up on the mattress and sighing in relief. "Uh huh. Much better." While her savior was preparing things, she figured she had to fill the silence. "Well, Willow's excited about doing magick with you. Almost as excited as the one time she had four mochas in a row; she's under strict watch now because of that, so I warn you, don't expose her to caffeine under any circumstances."</p>
<p>"I won't, and...so am I." The witch said, smiling. "She's got so much power, and she d-doesn't realize it. My mom was the same way, and she said the m-most important thing about spells was learning to control them."</p>
<p>"And you'll help Will do that, right? Cause magick kinda scares me." Buffy admitted, even though she was becoming more informed about the subject. "No offense."</p>
<p>"N-no, it should. It's s-something you have to respect, cause it is dangerous. Like, you can't interfere with n-natural processes." She was always taught be afraid of the possibilities; if you feared it, you didn't cross the line. Finishing the mixture, she brought it over to the bed. "But d-don't worry, this is all-natural. I only use magick when I have to."</p>
<p>"Good policy." The slayer told her, and then without needing to be instructed to, turned over. "I appreciate this. Remind me to return the favor sometime."</p>
<p>Tara sat on the end of her bed, and stared down at the shirt that covered Buffy's back. She froze; this was a bad idea. "D-does this kind of thing happen a lot?"</p>
<p>"If I'm lucky, it's all that happens. I've had worse, more visible injuries, believe me."</p>
<p>"How do you h-handle it?" The witch frowned.</p>
<p>"I dunno. I just block it out during the fight, and hope I've got enough strength to limp somewhere afterwards." It was said completely nonchalant; it worried Tara. "Everything okay? Where's my relief?"</p>
<p>The wicca had to pull herself together; she didn't know how slaying worked, and it wasn't her place to butt in. She had to concentrate on doing the only she could at the moment - a harmless massage. This was going to be totally innocent, and she couldn't back out just because of her hormones. She could do this, it could stay within the appropriate boundaries, and she wouldn't wreck a good thing. Make a new friend feel better - a simple task. Lifting up the shirt so she could see the bottom half of Buffy's back, she shakingly gathered some of the green-colored cream she made onto her fingers, and began rubbing it in.</p>
<p>The initial contact caused both girls to suck in audible breaths, and Tara had to force herself not to stop right then. Calm, even breathing; that's all she had to do. Though Buffy's sighs and unintelligible noises of satisfaction were complimentary, they didn't make things any easier. Below her, the slayer had started off tense, but Tara knew what she was doing. It got even better when both of her hands applied pressure to just the right spot. She felt the offending "knot" untie itself under her touch.</p>
<p>"Ah...I think you..." Buffy intended to tell Tara that her efforts were successful, but the sentence died before it was fully uttered. She was still enjoying it, and her higher processes didn't care why. "Yow..."</p>
<p>"Does it hurt?" Tara's voice was so low that Buffy barely heard her.</p>
<p>"Not hurt...definitely...no...yowness good..." Her patient murmured, eyes drooping.</p>
<p>The phone seemed to ring on purpose then, and the two blondes received a rude awakening. On the second ring, the shock wore off, the glaze vanishing from their eyes. Tara grabbed it as quick as she could manage, and Buffy sat up, straightening her shirt with a cough for good measure. They glanced at each other, trying to pretend everything was normal.</p>
<p>"H-hi?...Willow?" The witch said, recognizing the person on the other end. "She's r-right here..."</p>
<p>The slayer smacked her forehead. "We're supposed to be studying for Pysch. Tell her I'll be there in five minutes. And I think you fixed me; I owe you, thanks."</p>
<p>'Shake it off.' Buffy thought to herself.</p>
<p>Tara nodded, giving her a weak smile, and then her guest left. They both were waiting for their blood to make the journey back upwards to their brains. Once she hung up with Willow, she fell back onto her bed, praying the shower down the hall was unoccupied. That was bordering on something other than friendly - her mother's advice about control wasn't simply limited to magick.</p>

<hr>

<p>"I'm glad you came; I know it's late." Willow said to Tara as she let her into the dorm room.</p>
<p>"I don't mind. It's f-fun doing spells with somebody else - there's more focus. We'll figure it out."</p>
<p>"It's simple really, but I just can't get it." In the middle of the floor sat the design of a star, and inside of it was a circle of white powder. A rose lay off to the side. "We're gonna float the rose. Then use the magicks to pluck the petals off, one at a time. Probably hasn't been working cause the book says something about having more than one person. Duh me, right? It's a synchronicity thing."</p>
<p>"Cool." Tara commented as they sat opposite each other within the star.</p>
<p>"And it should be very pretty."</p>
<p>The redhead placed the rose in the center of the star, and Tara's eye caught sight of the high stack of magick-related books on one of the beds.</p>
<p>"Are those all yours?" She asked.</p>
<p>"Nope. They're Buffy's. She borrowed them from Giles."</p>
<p>"The man who used to be the librarian at your high school?"</p>
<p>"Yep, and he's still her watcher. Sorta-kinda unofficially, but without him, we woulda been flying blind the past few years. Not in the literal sense of being airborne, but...you get my point. Don't you?"</p>
<p>The blonde nodded, smiling. "Uh, why d-does she h-have -?"</p>
<p>"I dunno, but she's been staying up, reading 'em like a madwoman lately." Willow smiled. "If magick was a class, her GPA would go through the roof; she won't tell me what it is, cause she knows I'd faint." Tara got this huge grin on her face. "Ready?"</p>
<p>They held out their arms, grasped hands, and then closed their eyes. Willow was taking deep breaths, beginning to feel the energy flowing. Then her partner opened a lid.</p>
<p>"What kind of stuff does she like to do? B-besides punching?" She was frowned at. "A-after we're done."</p>
<p>Why couldn't the blondes just ask each other these things? They began again, and soon enough, a bright light appeared on the star. Feeling the breeze signaled to them that the spell was taking effect. After a few seconds, they opened their eyes; seeing the rose on the same level as their shoulders, they separated their hands and smiled.</p>
<p>"It worked." Tara said softly.</p>
<p>"Now for the hard part." Buffy was just getting in, though, and when the door opened, all concentration was lost. The rose flew at the slayer - who caught it. "Or not."</p>
<p>"You shouldn't have, guys." She brought the flower to her nose, smirking. "Am I interrupting?" Willow looked between the two, and just threw her hands in the air. "Patrol was boring. I just wanna curl up with Mr. Gordo and read about Salem. I could skip it, but I hafta be thorough. No matter how disturbing it is...hi, Tara."</p>
<p>They both blushed at the same moment - every time they saw one another since the "almost something" incident, they recalled memories of beds and massages. It wasn't something they'd soon forget, and for Buffy, it added all new thoughts for her to analyze. Some less than platonic ones had been recently been sneaking into her mind, and implanting themselves into what she already thought about the witch. The funny thing? They weren't entirely unwelcome.</p>
<p>The witch waved. "Mr. Gordo?"</p>
<p>"My pig." That answer cleared everything *right* up. "I'll show him to you."</p>
<p>Willow was getting the impression that she was going to have to step in and do something with them if she ever wanted to grow as a witch, but she didn't know what, yet.</p>

<hr>

<p>It took a couple weeks, but it was now at the point where Buffy and Willow didn't have to go to Tara and physically pry her from her room. The witch was willingly coming to them and asking if they wanted to do one thing or another. The awkwardness over the massage was gone, too. She didn't know what they saw in her, but she was grateful to the Goddess for their friendship. She wasn't going to waste the gift; if this was all she was allowed, she'd be happy with it. She was in a blissful state of ignorance now, concealing the truth of what she was even from herself.</p>
<p>She and Willow had set aside practice time each day, and as they talked, the more comfortable she became. As soon as Buffy found out that their sessions were a regular thing, though, the slayer sat in on them. If Tara hadn't known that Buffy was straight, she would've thought that the visits were partially motivated by jealousy, but that was ridiculous. She'd seen references to vampire slayers in the odd book here and there - Buffy being one was the coolest thing. There were tons of questions, but when she started looking into her aura she saw a lot of pain there, and didn't want to upset her by asking too many.</p>
<p>She wanted to help her, only she wasn't sure how, so they'd talk about her friends and slaying techniques - she didn't know if she was ready for more people yet. Besides, they sounded strange.</p>
<p>Every once and a while Buffy would mention some magickal fact she'd come across, and Tara was more than happy to explain (and show) things to her. It was difficult to explain slaying, however, and the witch couldn't see her as this big superhero. Buffy seemed normal enough - a caring, strong-willed, yet still fragile, girl. She'd seen only brief glimpses of the other persona, which eventually caused her to decide to accompany the slayer on patrol to view a typical night. Buffy's reaction was somewhere between being worried and being thrilled, and Willow helped thrilled to win out.</p>
<p>They had just entered the cemetery, in mid-conversation; Tara wouldn't get hurt.</p>
<p>"You loved your mom, a lot, huh?" Buffy questioned gently.</p>
<p>"We k-kind of understood each other. My d-dad and m-my brother...they didn't. She was amazing. Not just with magick; she was good at -"</p>
<p>"Being a mom." The slayer smiled.</p>
<p>"Yeah." The witch smiled back.</p>
<p>"Sounds like it. Looks like she was good at her job, too." Tara blushed. "I don't spend enough time with mine. She's had to deal with a bunch of stuff, but she's always been there for me, you know? I think you'd like her."</p>
<p>"If she's anything l-like you..." Tara trailed off before she got in too deeply.</p>
<p>Buffy blushed next, and the conversation hit a lull for a few rows of headstones. Then a more fun topic occurred to her.</p>
<p>"Ooh. Idea. What celebrity and/or hunky movie star do you fantasize about the most? I'd ask the vampires, but I fear their answers. So dish." Buffy said. "And don't say you haven't, cause I won't believe you." She wasn't hearing anything. "Fine, I'll go first. It's a tie between George Clooney and Brad Pitt. You think they'd get uglier with age, but luckily for us, they don't. Yeah, they probably got some help from plastic surgery -"</p>
<p>"Whoa...Brad Pitt...really is a guy? But he a-always looks so pretty."</p>
<p>Just when she thought she shouldn't have told a joke, Buffy started laughing, and she smiled in relief.</p>
<p>"It's scary - I can actually picture him in drag." The slayer remarked once the laughter stopped. "He might even be more attractive as a woman, and you know what? I'd switch like that."</p>
<p>"You w-would?" She didn't think her tone was *that* hopeful.</p>
<p>"Sure, why not? I'm thinking of taking lessons from Anya and just turning my back on men all together. Things never, ever go right; mostly cause of compatibility issues." Such as vampirism, and asshole-ism. "I've gotta conserve my energy, and they're way too much work."</p>
<p>"Bad experiences?"</p>
<p>"Nothing but." Buffy sighed. "Sorry, I'm just venting and ranting, really. I usually say all this to myself, but now that you're here listening, it sounds less insane. Thanks for the peace of mind."</p>
<p>"Oh." And her hopes were dashed. "A-anytime."</p>
<p>"So? Which celebrity? It's not somebody old, is it? Well, 'Harrison Ford' old is okay; 'Bob Hope' old is just...a disturbing visual place. Let's hear it already; I'm not easily shocked."</p>
<p>'If I tell her, she'll never speak to me again.'</p>
<p>'Do you really think so?'</p>
<p>'I-I don't...I barely know her.'</p>
<p>'Then be honest with her and find out who she is. Have to stop being afraid sometime.'</p>
<p>'What if I ruin everything?'</p>
<p>Her internal conservation was over when Buffy placed a hand on her arm and stared at her like she'd gone off to another planet. "Tara?"</p>
<p>"Joey Lauren Adams." The witch said quietly.</p>
<p>Buffy's forehead wrinkled. "The guy from Blossom?" Tara shook her head with a smirk; when it finally registered, eyes bulged. "Wait, you're -?"</p>
<p>"Well, well."</p>
<p>She couldn't process for very long, because Spike chose at that moment to emerge from the shadows. He'd been eavesdropping for the past twenty minutes, and what he watched he was having a hard time accepting. Approaching them, he realized that this was going to be extremely entertaining. The evil-looking grin on his face told Tara to back up, but Buffy just shook her head.</p>
<p>"Know the Initiative I told you about? They fixed him." She whispered to the frightened blonde. "He can only pummel demons, so he basically just skulks around like a loser now, and it gets annoying fast."</p>
<p>But she wasn't exactly...not demonic. No. She shouldn't have come, shouldn't have deluded herself this far. She was going to lose her friendship for sure.</p>
<p>"I can hear you." Spike spoke up.</p>
<p>"Oh geez, that's right. Super-hearing is a perk for the undead. Don't I feel like a moron?" She said sarcastically. "What do you want?"</p>
<p>"Was heading off to the butcher's for a refill, and I had to see who was making the big, bad bitch all-a-giggle. Why Slayer, I had no idea you were so liberated. Did it make the poof all jealous? He's still stuck in the 1700's, that one."</p>
<p>"Spike, what the hell are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't tell me you're that bloody blind. She likes you," He pointed at Tara, stepping close to her as she hung her head, "in that *special* way. Ain't that right, luv?"</p>
<p>Buffy couldn't think, but she knew she wanted him gone. She got in between the two of them. "Leave her alone."</p>
<p>"There you go, secret's out. Feel better? I know I do." Spike said with satisfaction. "Or are there more lurking about?"</p>
<p>He was punched, and then thrown to the ground by the slayer.</p>
<p>"I c-can't..." Tara stuttered, and once she got her legs to work, she started running away.</p>
<p>"You're such a bastard." She snapped at him. "And, oh yeah, the butcher's closed. Go and find some rats." She took off after the other girl. "Tara, wait!"</p>
<p>He propped himself up on his elbows, laughing. "What, no gratitude then?"</p>

<hr>

<p>"C-come in." Tara said to Willow from her bed.</p>
<p>It was going on four days since she'd spoken to her or Buffy, and this was the first time either of them had approached her. She was convinced that the slayer was avoiding her. Well, she was avoiding her, too, so it evened out. She didn't know what else to do; sheltering herself hadn't helped, it just let the fact that she wasn't honest, eat at her. Now she'd pay for it. The other witch came to sit with her, and she looked away.</p>
<p>"How you doing?" The blonde didn't answer. "I'm on psycho slayer recon, wanna help me?"</p>
<p>This got Tara's attention. She drove her insane? "Is s-something wrong with Buffy?"</p>
<p>"No...no, she's totally fine. Oh, that's right, you don't..." The redhead paused. "It's a long story, but there's another slayer. Her name's Faith and she's crazy, skanky, and evil. She was in a coma, but she's awake now, and up to her old, psychotic tricks. Faith is bad news; Buffy needs to find her before she hurts any more people."</p>
<p>She took a deep breath, considering it. "If it'll help...o-okay."</p>
<p>"It will. But if we see her, we don't engage. That leads to bruised faces. Running, fleeing and skedaddling - that's the plan."</p>
<p>"I'm not so good with the whole," Tara made punches that looked like she was pawing the air, "anyway."</p>
<p>"Swimming?" Willow smirked.</p>
<p>The blonde lowered her fists. "Violence." She clarified, lamely.</p>
<p>"Ask Buffy to show you a move or two. I bet she'd -"</p>
<p>"Do you know?" Tara cut her off. "You know, a-about me?"</p>
<p>"Hmm mm. And you wanna know what I think?" She braced herself. "Big whoop, you're gay. It doesn't bother her, either. Why'd you run off?"</p>
<p>"Cause Buffy found out...t-that I..."</p>
<p>"You do? Seriously?" Willow almost tackled her in a hug. "That's great! Even though Spike's a jerk."</p>
<p>"It is?"</p>
<p>"Yes! You guys talk about each other so much it drives me nuts, and now I get why! She *so* likes you; I played Cupid in a Valentine's play in fourth grade once, but this'll be way better."</p>
<p>Tara vigorously shook her head. "Willow, she's straight."</p>
<p>"Straight-smaight! If she can date a vampire, she can date a girl. We'll make her flexible. It's my new mission." Tara couldn't help but smile. "And she hasn't come by only cause she didn't want you to be uncomfortable. Plus, it's been a busy slaying week. With what happened to Professor Walsh and all."</p>
<p>"So she's not m-mad?"</p>
<p>"No way." Willow stared at her. "You gonna get up? The sooner we jail Faith, the sooner you two'll be trading smoochies."</p>
<p>Tara blushed, allowing herself to be pulled off the bed, but before they went any further, she had to be truthful. "T-there's something else. I'm...I'm a demon." She spoke to her feet. "I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"A demon?" Her friend looked shocked, and then slowly shook her head. "Who told you that?"</p>
<p>"My dad. All the women in m-my family, he said. When they turn twenty."</p>
<p>"Well then he's an stupid-head. You're no demon, cause if you were, I wouldn't call you my friend. Or trust you."</p>
<p>"That's nice, but...you can't be sure."</p>
<p>"I'll find a way to be." She took Tara's hand, and gave her no choice but to look up. "You haven't um, checked me out, have you?"</p>
<p>The girl cleared her throat. "No, o-of course...no."</p>
<p>"Why not?" Willow pouted.</p>

<hr>

<p>Faith couldn't wait to ditch Sunnydale; with Buffy's body the world was open to her, she just had to keep the act up a little while longer. She was sitting in the Bronze across from Tara, a girl Buffy was supposed to know, so she'd nearly blown her cover. Willow was getting the blonde a bottle of water. The way she was being looked at - did the chick have the hots for Miss Goodie Two-Shoes? Holy sh...there was no mistaking that damn mushy gaze. There was no mistaking the feeling happening down below and between the legs, either.</p>
<p>What the hell? Where'd this come from? Tara was okay if you liked the, "Disney, G-Rated" type, but she didn't really go for the innocent act - those people were the ones you shoved knives into. Wait, this body was still technically a loner...since when did Buffy get all warm over the smoother sex? The undead were usually more her style. So not only did she decide to the hop the fence, she decided to hop the fence for Minnie-Frickin'-Mouse? Jesus, it was pitiful how unadventurous she was.</p>
<p>"B's not driving stick anymore." She whispered in a voice that had yet to become anything other than foreign to her. "Who'd a thought it?"</p>
<p>If she'd been aware that Buffy was capable of swinging, she would've pushed a little harder last year. Well, if she had more time to play she would've taken full advantage of the development, but seeing as how time was of the essence, she'd have to settle with screwing with the girl's mind instead. The girl who was sitting there all awkward and mute after Willow practically made her take a seat. Oh, she wasn't going to pour her heart out, was she? That's just what Faith wanted - a Hallmark moment. Gag. Her choice to don leather seemed to be distracting the quiet one.</p>
<p>Faith gave her a sly grin. "So what's up?"</p>
<p>The second she saw her, Tara felt like...oh no. The pieces were just starting to fit, and on other hand, they didn't. That was the problem. She had to be calm - she couldn't let on that...poor Buffy. The witch was surprised she knew the slayer's aura that well; she saw the holes in an instant. Goddess, where was she?</p>
<p>"What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? Hmm. Maybe I oughta rephrase the question."</p>
<p>"Ca-ca-ca..." Damn it! She hated when she stuttered.</p>
<p>"You gonna spit that out sometime today, sweetie? Time's a precious thing, ya know."</p>
<p>"C-can we talk?"</p>
<p>"Sure, *I* can talk, but you? So far, the evidence doesn't look like it's working in your favor." The witch swallowed. "Listen, here's some free advice. Get help. That little broken record of a voice you got, isn't doin' you any good. I say this as a friend who cares about you, cause not pointing this stuff out...well, that would be just plain wrong. We can't have you embarrassing the group, can we? I love that gang of mine to death."</p>
<p>The rogue slayer knew this was out of character, but when she had fun, she had a tendency to get carried away. One of her many flaws.</p>
<p>Willow came over just in time, sounding out of breath. "Buffy, guy in the corner."</p>
<p>Faith found the guy she was talking about leading a girl towards the back area of the club, but wasn't exactly enthralled. "Yeah. Good call."</p>
<p>"What?" Tara questioned cautiously.</p>
<p>"Vampire." The redhead elaborated.</p>
<p>"Wicked obvious." Again, Faith was disinterested. Until she realized what Willow expected from her. "So I should slay him." She got up.</p>
<p>"You want help?"</p>
<p>"Nah, I got it."</p>
<p>While the impostor walked away, Tara knew they had to get out of there, and fast. Buffy's life was at stake.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Okay, are you really feeling all blechy, or was that you trying to avoid Buffy?" Willow asked as they entered Tara's dorm. "Cause it's never gonna work if you can't be in the same place for more than five minutes."</p>
<p>"She's not Buffy." Tara told her.</p>
<p>"Are you sure? I mean, the resemblance was very Buffy-like."</p>
<p>"But she's not."</p>
<p>Willow felt very slow. "You lost me."</p>
<p>"Well, uh, a person's energy has a flow, a unity. Buffy's was...was fragmented. It-it's grated, like something forced in where it doesn't belong. Plus, she was, um, she was kind of mean." The blonde fiddled with her hands.</p>
<p>That got the redhead onboard. "So you think Buffy's not herself? Like she's been possessed or something?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure."</p>
<p>"You didn't sense a hyena energy at all, did you?" Her magick partner asked with concern. "Because hyena possession is just...unpleasant."</p>
<p>"I-I think there's a way we can..." Tara went to her desk and opened the book that was lying out. Next to it sat Mr. Gordo - he could help. "Here..."</p>
<p>Willow joined her, and smiled, seeing the animal. "When did she give you him?"</p>
<p>"Oh, uh, she said I could borrow him. She thought I needed it more than she did." The witch got focused again quickly. "The passage to the nether realm. There-there's a ritual.  If you can find Buffy there, you should be able to see."</p>
<p>"If it'll help her." Then she noticed Tara's worried expression. "What?"</p>
<p>"Well, the nether realm exists beyond the physical world. Accessing it is...it-it's kind of like astral projection. It's very intense. I'd have to be your anchor. Keep you on this plane."</p>
<p>"I trust you."</p>
<p>"I'd go, I-I wanna go, but I have more practice with anchoring, and it's not like anything we've ever -"</p>
<p>"Hey, how many times do I have to say it? I trust you. With my life and with Buffy's. Now let's get her back."</p>

<hr>

<p>"Oh, oh! When I had psychic power, I heard my mom think that you were like a
stevedore during sex." Buffy in Faith's body was saying to Giles, trying to convince him that she was telling the truth. With his look, she stopped. "Do you want me to continue?"</p>
<p>"Actually, I beg you to stop." The ex-watcher responded.</p>
<p>"What's a stevedore?" She asked quizzically.</p>
<p>"All right, let's...um, I need you to explain everything."</p>
<p>"And I will. *After* we get Faith."</p>
<p>He probably had no idea what it took for her to get here, what she was forced to do. The Council's team treated her like an animal. There was so much distrust and loathing in their eyes, that it wasn't even funny. She got a taste of what it was like for Faith, and for a moment or two she felt sorry for her, but then she remembered that the brunette had brought it upon herself. Maybe she was partially to blame; she could've been there for her more. But damn it, Faith had to take responsibility for her own actions.</p>
<p>Key words? Her own. She didn't drive her to murder, and she hated being made to feel guilty for that.</p>
<p>Mostly what kept her from quitting was her desire to save her friends from whatever Faith was planning to do to them. And Tara. Tara didn't know Faith like they did, and she would be caught in the middle. If the Bostonian figured out that the witch had feelings for her, and that she was sort of thinking she possibly did, too, it could've been bad. That's what got her inside Giles' house. She didn't even get the chance to talk to her yet, after what happened with Spike. Her reactions to that massage made sense now. She was attracted to every aspect of the girl, and she wasn't sure how to deal with it.</p>
<p>The front door opened and Willow and Tara rushed in</p>
<p>"Giles!" The redhead called.</p>
<p>"Will." Buffy turned to her.</p>
<p>"Oh my God."</p>
<p>"Willow, wait. You don't understand."</p>
<p>"You're Buffy. You and Faith switched bodies." She spoke to the English bachelor. "Probably through a Draconian Katra spell."</p>
<p>Giles raised his eyebrows. "She understands it better than I do."</p>
<p>"Tara knew right away that you weren't you. So we connected with the nether realms to find out what happened. And we conjured this." She opened the jewelry-box to reveal a small, emerald sphere inside. "It's a katra. Or the home-conjured version." She gave it to Giles. "It-it should switch you back, if you can get a hold of Faith."</p>
<p>Buffy looked at Tara, who had been silent, and squeezed her in a tight hug. "Tara, thank God." The witch hugged her back, despite the oddness. "If this is too weird, we can stop and wait till I get my body back."</p>
<p>"You're still you." Her fellow blonde said, simply.</p>
<p>Buffy smiled, pulling away. "Thanks, but I'm kinda fond of my flesh."</p>
<p>"Me too." Tara said under her breath as the slayer faced Giles.</p>
<p>"Where's Faith?"</p>
<p>Then the phone rang.</p>

<hr>

<p>It was night in the cemetery. The vampires that had been in the church were dust, Buffy had her body back, and Faith had run. It was doubtful that she'd return, but in that split second when they switched, there was a flicker of the real Faith in her eyes. But whatever threads were still holding the other slayer together, were extremely thin ones. She was exhausted; she just couldn't chase after her again. Too many lines were crossed, and she'd probably push her over the edge, anyway. Maybe someone else had the power to save her from herself.</p>
<p>She was with Tara - Willow had told her what the blonde had said about being a demon, and that simply wasn't true. It wasn't something she'd enjoy, but there was only one way to prove it to her. Her dad and brother sounded like two, very close-minded individuals, so she had her own suspicions about why they would lie to her. She wondered if they cared at all about the trauma they had obviously put her through. With the exception of Giles, Xander, and that guy who lent her a pencil in class last week, she was having difficulty not hating the male race.</p>
<p>"Do you really think you should be out here?" Tara was asking her. "You've been t-through a lot; you should rest."</p>
<p>"Don't worry, no slaying on the agenda, and this'll only take a minute, I promise." Buffy assured the witch. "I'm not letting you go around thinking you're not human. I bet your dad wouldn't know a real demon if it kicked him in the..." Her whole body tensed. "God, that pisses me off. See, as a rule, I don't trust dads. I've been..." Her eyes saddened. "Mine could care less about me and mom. One second I was his daughter, then the next it was, 'We're divorced now; see ya! Oh, and you'll get a couple empty promises from me a month!'"</p>
<p>Tara tried to kill the butterflies and her stomach, but didn't say a word. She wanted to believe she was human, yet she was trained to believe his word was final, and blind obedience got mistaken for love. She had known her father wasn't a good man even when her mother used to hear most of his commands, but if she saw him again, she'd probably fall into line without a fight.</p>
<p>"I'm getting off track, aren't I?" The slayer said, apologetically. "We're not here for me, and...I should try to keep my mouth shut."</p>
<p>"No, it's...just another thing we have in c-common." Tara tried to make light of it, but it didn't quite work.</p>
<p>They trekked quietly for a while, thinking to themselves. Buffy thought about her numerous unresolved issues with her father and how she still hated that she missed him. Her witch companion thought about how she had a tendency to take the negative things said about her to heart more than she did the positives. Which was why the belief that she was demon was so rooted in her, and it was why what Faith said continued to stick.</p>
<p>"B-Buffy? When I...d-do what I just did..." Tara trailed off, which was explanation enough.</p>
<p>"Stutter?"</p>
<p>"Does it b-bother you? I've done it, um, since I was a little girl. I get nervous and-and...I sound like a dork."</p>
<p>"You're definitely far from being a dork. It's...cute." They both turned red. "But there's no reason to be nervous. Everyone met you, right? They liked you, Willow likes you, I like you -"</p>
<p>"That's k-kinda what makes me..."</p>
<p>"Oh." Buffy coughed. "Yeah, I guess we should talk about...things. First you have to see that you're as human as the next, uh, human person, though. Which is gonna get cleared up right now."</p>
<p>They reached a crypt that was inhabited by a certain vampire, and Buffy shoved the door open to find Spike watching his television. He turned his head in their direction with a scowl, clicking the off button on the remote. Taking a cigarette out of the pack that was sitting on the arm of his chair, he stood, moving to acknowledge the visitors who weren't polite enough to knock. When he could see the vein pulsing in Buffy's neck, he stopped and lit the cigarette.</p>
<p>"Ellen," He addressed Tara, "Anne," He glanced at the slayer, "long time no see. What brings you by the grave? Unannounced, no less."</p>
<p>"We need you to do something for us, Spike." Buffy said, already annoyed.</p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows. "Off the top of my head...nope, can't do it. See, here's the thing. Charity got old a century and a half ago, never been the generous type. And last time I checked, helping out slayers' little girlfriends wasn't on my 'To-Do' list."</p>
<p>"Does it look like I care?"</p>
<p>"Does it look like I do?" He shot back. "Go on, you're interrupting my Tele-Time."</p>
<p>She charged him, planting her forearm against his neck so he would stay in place along the right wall of the crypt. The cigarette dropped from his mouth, and she promptly stomped on it.</p>
<p>"You don't have a choice."</p>
<p>"Buffy, maybe we -" Tara tried, thinking it wasn't worth this much trouble.</p>
<p>"It's okay, Tara." She focused on Spike. "Look, her family made her think she was a demon, all right?"</p>
<p>Spike eyed the witch over Buffy's shoulder. "Her? A demon? Oh, that's rich. Musta been some tale...I knew it. She is as gullible as she looks. Had her pegged from the start."</p>
<p>"Stop talking." She increased the pressure. "Help me show her she's not a demon, you live."</p>
<p>"That threat has me quakin' more and more every time I hear it." He pushed her off. "You offering me a free shot, Slayer? I wouldn't wanna leave a mark on that face, even though I don't see much to save there, anyway. What's the big draw?"</p>
<p>"Good, and lots of it. Something you don't have, so I'll be watching." Buffy spat. "Tara, c'mere." The witch hurried to the slayer's side, who was suddenly having doubts. "We can just go. Him hurting you..."</p>
<p>Tara shook her head. "I have to know. And he won't h-hurt me that bad, right?"</p>
<p>"Not while I'm here, and not if he wants to avoid a massive headache followed by a staking." The last comment was pointedly directed at him, as she wrapped an arm around the blonde's shoulders. "I mean it."</p>
<p>"I trust you." Tara smiled.</p>
<p>Spike looked bored. "Where're the violins and the choir? Let's just get on with it."  He hit her nose with the thick part of his palm, and then reeled back in pain, grabbing his head and gritting his teeth, which forced back any screams that would've made him appear any less tough. "Happy?!"</p>
<p>She brought her hands to her nose, wincing. "He hit my nose!"</p>
<p>"And it hurt him." Buffy cringed, but sort of smiled, grabbing Tara's hands and checking her nose for injuries. It looked fine. "So what's that mean?"</p>
<p>"I'm not a demon?" The wicca asked, her eyes growing wide.</p>
<p>"You're not a demon."</p>
<p>Tara wanted to cry, both out of pain and relief. "He still hit my nose."</p>
<p>"Then you have my permission to stick him on the ceiling."</p>
<p>Spike was floating almost instantaneously. "Hey! Come on now!"</p>
<p>The girls looked up, giggling.</p>
<p>"How's the weather up there? Any cobwebs?" Buffy called. Leaving, her arm remained on Tara's shoulders. "You know, I watched Chasing Amy a few days ago, and I think I figured out why you like Joey Lauren Adams." Her friend flushed. "Can she kiss or what? But what I thought was even cooler, was how someone who liked girls, could fall in love with a guy. You think that works in reverse, but with a happier ending? Like, on occasion?"</p>
<p>When they stepped back outside, Spike fell to the floor. "Bloody hell!"</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours later, Tara walked into the Bronze, finding Buffy sitting at a table near the stage. Willow had asked to meet here, but she didn't see her fellow wicca anywhere in the club. She was happy to see the slayer, though, and hoped she didn't mind some company until their mutual friend made her appearance. The witch was in high spirits, secure in her humanity, and there was a chance Buffy might feel like she did about her.</p>
<p>Best of all, the revelation hadn't scared her off.</p>
<p>"Tara!" Buffy called when she got closer to the table, motioning her over. "What're you doing here?"</p>
<p>She pulled out one of the empty seats. "Willow called me...can I?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, sit." The slayer was confused. "She called you, too? Huh."</p>
<p>"You mean...? I w-wonder where she is, then." Tara looked around as she situated herself in the chair.</p>
<p>"Beats me. When she shows, she shows, I guess." Fingers drummed on the tabletop. "Want a drink?"</p>
<p>"No thanks."</p>
<p>They moved their heads to the beat for a few minutes before speech resumed.</p>
<p>"So, been here before?" The slayer asked, initiating conversation.</p>
<p>"O-once. When um, Faith was -"</p>
<p>Buffy sat her hand over Tara's, anger bubbling up. "Whatever she said to you, it's not true."</p>
<p>"I know. I got it the f-first ten times." She smiled when her friend blushed. "I appreciated all of them, though."</p>
<p>The music being played distracted them from talking, and so their only other option was to look at each other, which they did quite extensively until Buffy cleared her throat.</p>
<p>"How about this band? Not too shabby, but what kind of name is 'The Spayed Cats'?"</p>
<p>"A funny one?" Tara smirked.</p>
<p>"Good point." Buffy matched that look, and laughed.</p>
<p>"I've wanted a kitten since I was four. I'd get one, but there's n-no pets allowed on campus."</p>
<p>"Want my opinion? Rules are meant to be broken." Came Buffy's less than legal endorsement for her having an animal companion. "But it's just, every time I watch people play up there now, I think about Oz. And that leads to him and Willow, and that leads to what he did."</p>
<p>"Do you think h-he'll come back?" The witch wondered.</p>
<p>"He was always smart; let's hope he still is, because then he will. Who'd be dumb enough to let Willow go for good? The werewolf issue doesn't cut it."</p>
<p>"I don't know the whole story, but the way she talks, she l-loves him a lot. I'd hate to see her stay lonely. It's not fun."</p>
<p>"I hear that. Our lives are really twisted. The only guys we can see ourselves with are vampires and ones that turn into dogs three nights a month. We need therapy."</p>
<p>"Maybe t-that's a sign." Tara said more bluntly than it sounded in her head, and it shocked her. "Uh..."</p>
<p>They both knew what she was getting at. To Buffy, the fact that Tara was attracted to her was flattering, and the more she thought about it, the fact that the attraction went both ways became less of a concern.</p>
<p>"Maybe it is." The slayer agreed with a small smile. "I dunno what the hold up is with her, but are you sure you're not thirsty? Cause I was gonna get sodas."</p>
<p>"No, I'll come I'm up."</p>
<p>"Have you thought about what you're gonna call it?" Buffy questioned.</p>
<p>They left the table holding hands, and from her viewpoint backstage, even though she couldn't hear the words, a redhead threw a fist in the air with an exclamation of, "Yes!"</p>

<hr>

<p>Buffy was sitting on the floor in Tara's room two weeks later, eating pizza, drinking soda, and watching Mall Rats. Willow had talked to them both earlier in the day, telling them to meet her at a restaurant, where reservations were made. If she wasn't there when they showed, the instructions were to order without her. But she wouldn't ever show, because given that similar conversations had taken place over the past fourteen days with the same result, it was considered a pretty safe bet. Willow's efforts were appreciated, but they were capable of hanging out without her assistance.</p>
<p>There was the Bronze, the movies, the Pump, and they were always duped. It was part of the redhead's crack plan to hook them up. When they realized she wasn't going to arrive, they figured they'd stay anyway, so as not to waste a trip. Three unofficial dates had transpired, but they were finally wise to her tricks. Staying in and pigging out was their original, very own idea, and the blondes were continuing to discover more about one another. Now that Tara didn't have to carry the burden of being a demon, she talked more openly, and with confidence.</p>
<p>"This I don't get." Buffy commented, watching the screen. "In Chasing Amy I don't think she was naked once, and you think she would've been. Was there or was there not some serious sex talk in that movie?" She pointed. "But here, she plays a totally different person, and you see her breasts for two seconds in a mall dressing room."</p>
<p>"Disappointed?" Tara grinned.</p>
<p>The slayer, who was taking a sip of her soda, spit it out when she heard that, and swatted the witch. "Y-you...you don't say that when someone's drinking! Especially Coke! What if it came out my nose? It burns, you know. Could be toxic."</p>
<p>Tara laughed, and they continued eating their dinner and watching the film.</p>
<p>"I never see the Magic Eye pictures, either. Some witch." She said, frowning at one of the numerous scenes where that guy was trying desperately to see the sailboat. "What is it?"</p>
<p>Buffy had grown quiet. She was physically and emotionally feeling things around Tara that hadn't been issues until her arrival. On their 'dates,' she was completely relaxed, but her small quip just now had the shorter blonde questioning whether or not she really was disappointed in the lack of nudity in that dressing room. Which then led down a tricky path, ending with a question she wasn't sure she had a right to ask. It was none of her business, but the words left her lips before her brain could catch up with her train of thought.</p>
<p>"You don't have to answer, but...when did you realize...?"</p>
<p>"That I was gay?" She received a nod. "You really wanna know?"</p>
<p>"Only if you wanna tell me. No pressure - pressure free question."</p>
<p>Tara smiled, took a bite of a slice, and once it was swallowed, she began. "It was after my mom died. Between her and my cousin Beth, they were like, my w-world. When she was gone, Beth didn't come around much, and it...I got lonely. I think her dad told her what mine told me, and she was the only family I felt comfortable around."</p>
<p>"The 'demon' story?" That still fried her.</p>
<p>"Uh huh. My dad always had his friends over - sometimes their sons came, but they weren't allowed to talk to me cause n-nobody could know. I guess they were good-looking, but I didn't notice; I didn't even know I was supposed to. I went to school and all, but I didn't have girls as friends because I was...kinda scared of them, cause I didn't know what to say, o-or do. And guys t-thought I was weird. Usually it was okay, I could handle it. I had my mom, and we'd do magick when my dad and brother were out of the house; that was all I cared about. With her not there, though, I was pretty lost.</p>
<p>"In tenth grade I, uh, got the courage to sit next to Ashley Michaels. I wanted a friend; I needed to t-talk to someone so much that it was driving me crazy. I missed her, but I had to heal, you know? Anyway, at first it was awkward, and then you couldn't separate us." Buffy smiled at Tara's wistful look. "We stayed best friends through senior year. Michaels and Maclay. M&M. That was our nickname. The only thing she didn't know about me was what...what I could do. We lived in a small town - mom always told me not to tell anybody, dad especially. But I wanted to. I wanted to show her everything.</p>
<p>"I loved her, but I didn't know it was in *that* way until a week before Prom. We were talking about who we were gonna ask, and I was staring at her and something inside of me just said, 'Kiss her.' It surprised both of us when I did, but then I knew, and I figured she would, too. I mean, I hadn't felt that close to anyone since mom, but at the same time, it was totally different." She hung her head. "T-that's when she screamed to her parents and called me a d-dy..."</p>
<p>Buffy placed a finger underneath her chin, and guided her head back up, seeing tears streaming down her face. "You don't have to say it, Tara. Ever."</p>
<p>She had to finish. "Well, m-my dad gave me the money he'd been saving to fix our camper, and pr-practically ordered me to buy a bus ticket. He didn't want me embarrassing him anymore." She sighed. "So I packed my things, then I l-left. It was a good thing I got accepted to UC Sunnydale, otherwise I would've had no place to go."</p>
<p>While Tara wiped the tears from her eyes, Buffy hugged her with enthusiasm. "Thank you. And yes, your enrollment here is a very good thing. There's much gladness for your attendance. Somebody in this town actually did something right for a change. It's a miracle that should be documented."</p>
<p>"You do right things all the time." The witch sniffed.</p>
<p>"I think that's a slight exaggeration. My mistakes have my good, slayerish deeds outnumbered by like, a thousand."</p>
<p>"Maybe, but all I know is, you're a better person than Ashley. *M-multiplied* by a thousand." She cracked a smile. "You've been so cool about letting me into your life, g-great about it. I'm not what I thought I was, and thanks to you and Willow, I know the truth now. You...you guys, are the best thing that's ever... I'm glad I'm here, too."</p>
<p>"Happy to hear that; and the Fates must be on your side." The slayer grinned, pulling back so she could see her face. "I've been doing my homework again, can you tell?"</p>
<p>"Oh, They wouldn't care about what h-happens to me..." Tara diminished her self-esteem.</p>
<p>Buffy decided something then. To hell with that other meaningless crap. She was falling in love with this girl. Or was she there already? This girl appeared so plain and ordinary upon a glance, but was really indescribable. Still, it was worth a shot - sexy while being cute, incredibly sweet and polite, powerful, knowledgeable, caring...and despite some attacks, innocent. Her own innocence was taken from her, and she could never reclaim it. She had to make sure Tara kept hers for as long as possible; she'd failed Willow as soon as Oz left.</p>
<p>"If you had a quick cram session, you'd remember that nothing and nobody is not and will not, ever be considered insignificant to the Fates - you're slipping. We've all got important parts to play, right?" Buffy never thought knowledge would be useful, but here was applying some.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Tara conceded, "and They did g-get me to you."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry you had to go through what you did." Buffy said sincerely. "But it would stink, after They went to all that trouble, if we didn't just do this, don't you think?" She paused. "You've never had a girlfriend." Tara nodded. "I've never had a girlfriend." Nodding again. "But we both want one."</p>
<p>"We...I...w-what are you saying?"</p>
<p>"Not saying anything." The slayer leaned forward, effectively capturing the wicca's lips, and staking a claim, so to speak. It was brief, however. "I didn't misread the whole situation, did I?"</p>
<p>Tara's response was to kiss her back. Again and again and again. All the things she could possibly want she was getting, and she wouldn't have believed Buffy would ever feel like she did. It was just another way in which the strong blonde was different than her once friend back home; she was *not* going to shy away from this. She wasn't going to shy away from much any longer.</p>
<p>"And I thought your hands were talented." Buffy winked, and the sly, strangely confident grin Tara gave her said that there was plenty in store for the future. "Now more kissing. Must be kissing..."</p>
<p>"Aha! I knew I'd..." Willow charged into the room to find them in the midst of their intimate activity. "Eep."</p>
<p>The blondes turned in her direction, and Buffy spoke for them. "Willow, hey. What, you call the restaurant and we weren't there?"</p>
<p>"How'd you know?" The redhead frowned. "Shoot. I didn't do a darn thing. Cupid? Sure, a Super Stupid Cupid."</p>
<p>"No, you did, and we'll happily give you all the credit if anyone asks." Her new magickally-inclined girlfriend was busy sliding her fingers down the long locks of hair that were situated behind her ear. "Won't we?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely." Tara agreed, though she was a little too happy to focus on reality.</p>
<p>"Really? You promise?" They nodded their heads affirmatively. "Okay, but I'm still owed some more vicarious smoochin'. So get the show on the road."</p>
<p>"Will!" Both girls exclaimed. They didn't perform on demand.</p>
<p>"Fine, if you won't kiss, then...then I get to eat the rest of that pizza!" She stuck her tongue out. "It's only fair."</p>

<hr>

<p>"Whatcha up to, Buff?" Xander said as he sat beside her on Giles' couch that weekend. She lifted up the magazine she was reading. "Ah, the feminine joy that is Cosmo. Which thrilling article is so engrossing?"</p>
<p>"Not an article. Quiz. Significant other. Important. Ssh." She responded distractedly, and then he took the magazine from her. "Hey!"</p>
<p>"What's Tara's favorite color?" He asked a random question off the page.</p>
<p>Yeah, the gang knew about them. She didn't waste any time conveying the news. To Xander it would've made more sense for Willow and Tara to be together, but he had little objection. After all, what did he know about girls? He was an ex-demon's sex slave for crying out loud. It led him to the conclusion that Angel had to be quite the male if Buffy felt the need to change her gender preference now that he was gone. That didn't do much for his pride, but he'd learned to shut up.</p>
<p>She bit her lip. "White. She's got white Christmas lights hanging in her dorm. That makes it her favorite color, right?"</p>
<p>"White's a color?"</p>
<p>"Of course it's a color. There's different shades; like off-white and milky-white."</p>
<p>"Isn't white the lacking of color?"</p>
<p>They looked at one another. Stumped, they looked toward the kitchen and questioned together, "Giles, is white a color!?"</p>
<p>"I'm rather busy...at the moment. I'd like to keep my house in one piece." The adult of the group couldn't figure out how Anya had talked him into cooking something in his oven; smoke was emerging from it. "Back away. Please."</p>
<p>"I don't get it! The overweight man on TV just says 'Bam' and the food appears. What am I doing wrong?" The ex-demon yapped.</p>
<p>"For starters...everything."</p>
<p>"Xander says all we do is have orgasms, and that that's not enough. Wouldn't you be happy with orgasms?" That was worth a shudder. "Well, I don't know what his problem is, but I just wanted to make him an appetizing meal for some variety so we could have sex with the leftovers afterwards. See, I've been reading about fetishes -"</p>
<p>"Anya, disappear. Go." Giles removed his glasses, and rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>"Xander, tell him to stop being cranky cause he was reincarnated British! It's not my fault he's got such an odd and easily misinterpreted vocabulary!"</p>
<p>Xander slouched out of view, and whispered to Buffy. "This is me ducking." She snickered. "Where's your witchy woman, anyway?"</p>
<p>"She and Willow went to the magic shop. They should be back any minute."</p>
<p>"That's brave. You can really leave them alone?" She glared at him. "Which is a dumb thing for me to say cause when it comes to gayness and girls and boundaries, I'm clueless." He paused. "Are there orgies?"</p>
<p>"Just ask me another question." Buffy shook her head. "One from the *quiz*."</p>
<p>"Hmm." Xander scanned the page. "Two blondes walk into a bar. One's a slayer and one's a witch. How long does it take them to screw..." She gaped. "...in a light bulb?"</p>
<p>"That's not in there!"</p>
<p>"Sure it is." He stuck the magazine behind his back.</p>
<p>"Then let me see." She demanded.</p>
<p>"Why, don't you trust me? That hurts."</p>
<p>She grinned sweetly. "Xander, do you like your arm?" The wiccas had good timing, walking in then. This distracted him, so she took back her property. "I knew it wasn't! Now make room for my girlfriend."</p>
<p>"Would someone remove her from my kitchen?" Giles was on the verge of pleading, so Xander jumped to it.</p>
<p>Tara occupied his vacated spot, accepting a kiss and a small squeeze around her waist.</p>
<p>"Get good stuff?" Buffy wondered.</p>
<p>"Too expensive." Tara was disappointed.</p>
<p>"I *do* still owe you a massage. Think that would help?"</p>
<p>"Later." The girlfriends grinned. "Um, there was...we-we r-ran by the campus on the way here, and there were all these police outside Lowell House."</p>
<p>"The Initiative's place? What was going on?" The only response was a face turning red. "Will?"</p>
<p>The redhead sat on the arm of the sofa. "We asked a couple people. They uh, they all said that they heard two uh, you know, somebodys inside, having sex every time they walked by. Since yesterday morning, I think...it must've been noisy...and they're, um, sorta dead now."</p>
<p>"That's horrible! Does this mean I have to be celibate? Cause I can't do that!" Anya exclaimed.</p>
<p>"An, calm down." Her boyfriend said quickly.</p>
<p>"No! You don't understand! I've had a few nuns as clients, and they're always frustrated! Sometimes to the point of insanity! You have to do something!"</p>
<p>Buffy was sure they would. Once they all stopped being embarrassed. "Tara, white's a color, isn't it?"</p>
