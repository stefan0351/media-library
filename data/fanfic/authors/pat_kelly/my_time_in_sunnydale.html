<p>I walked through the streets of Sunnydale, somehow knowing I was being chased by vampires.
I was probably the quickest kill they'd ever have, being on crutches and all. I figured
that screaming or trying to increase my pace wouldn't do me any good, so I just waited for
the inevitable to happen.</p>

<p>A purely morbid part of me wondered what it would feel like; having my blood slowly
drained from my body. Death was the ultimate mystery. Would I get a free pass to my
personal heaven because of the way my life was taken from me? Well I was about to find
out. I ended up standing outside the under construction multiplex, knowing the vampires
weren't afraid of killing me out in the open.</p>

<p>I found myself looking around for any spectators. Some would run, I knew, but there were
those other sickos who would watch with fascination. Then high tail it just before the
feeding ended. But the street was deserted. Apparently the residents were a little smarter
than I thought. Surprising the vampires who thought they were sneaking up on me, I turned
around to face them.</p>

<p>They growled with hunger. Seeing their fangs, their feral eyes, their twisted smiles, I
finally felt the fear most victims must have felt before me. But I stood defiantly.</p>

<p>"Look at the brave four legger boys." The one I guessed was the leader said.</p>

<p>As they came closer to me, the intense desire not to die kicked in. I had subdued it
before, thinking death would be an adventure, a welcome release. But then I remembered how
much I liked breathing. With this new attitude, I did something less than intelligent.</p>

<p>"You like my crutches? Want a closer look?" I asked them with a smug smile. Boy, was I
being an idiot.</p>

<p>I saw that my left crutch was placed just in line with the leader's groin area, and
without thinking, I aimed for his undead genitals and scored a direct hit. He grabbed his
hurt package, and his two buddies proceeded to get revenge. They ripped my crutches off my
arms, and threw them across the street.</p>

<p>I had experience with falling to the ground, and I landed on my hands and knees with
minimal pain. Minimal, but it was still concrete. The leader recovered, and picked me up
by the back of my shirt. I felt weightless. I flailed helplessly, and then he threw me so
I could join my crutches. If you're ever prey for vampires, take this advice.</p>

<p>Don't piss them off. You're just making things worse for yourself.</p>

<p>I knew it was close to over now. They were still hungry, and anger only increases a
vampire's appetite. My vision was blurry, and they were standing over me. I didn't even
see them move across the street. Then they were on me. The lackeys sank their teeth into
both my wrists, and I felt the leader turn my head. But the feeling of fangs puncturing
the flesh of my neck never came.</p>

<p>My blood was no longer being drained from my body. There were only growls and sounds of
bones breaking. I felt dust shower down on me, choking as it entered my mouth. One of them
had died. Only one person could have killed it, and I knew the other two were going to
join it. I also knew I was going to live.</p>

<p>I was very grateful to her for it. I didn't think she was going to show, but I should have
expected it. I was weak from the bloodloss I had sustained, and movement was an issue. I
felt her crouch over me. The danger was gone. She was checking my injuries, and she felt
for my pulse. I was alive.</p>

<p>But when I found my voice, I didn't thank for that. I said the first thing that came to my
mind.</p>

<p>"What kept you?"</p>

<p>She smirked at me, even though I could tell she was worried about the snacking wounds the
vampires left on my wrists. I had never seen her this close before. Stunning was the only
word I could think of. I had much respect for her. She had survived everything placed in
her way, and still kept going forward. She was an amazing girl. No, she was a woman now.
She deserved happiness. She deserved bliss. But the problem was, no one was worthy of her,
least of all me. And I had no delusions of even attempting to try.</p>

<p>Her voice brought me back. "You're welcome. Now what're we gonna do? Hospital sounds good
to me."</p>

<p>I shook my head. "Don't like hospitals."</p>

<p>"You and me both. But see, I can get away with cuts like yours. I heal real fast. You lost
a good amount of blood."</p>

<p>"How do my crutches look?"</p>

<p>I watched her turn her head. When she looked back at me, it wasn't with a pleasant
expression.</p>

<p>"Pretty bent. Destroyed would probably be a better word." She was quiet. I guess she was
thinking about what to do. "It's the year of the double zeroes. You'd think I'd invest in
a cell-phone."</p>

<p>She sighed, and lifted my right arm up. I knew the time for moving had come, and I wasn't
looking forward to it. "Be gentle?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Like a feather. Promise. A friend of mine lives a few blocks from here. He'll bandage
you, then you're going to the hospital. Can you walk if I -?"</p>

<p>I nodded, and she put her one arm around my shoulders, her other one around my waist. It
took me a minute to get my legs cooperating, and then we were off. Slowly, but we were
off.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>We reached her friend's house. He was a man I knew well. He too had survived many
tragedies. Most in a past I only knew an inkling of. Had endured both physical and
emotional pain, and he didn't even have supernatural abilities. I had as much respect for
him, as I had for her. No more, no less. He had had to make tough choices, and was a man
was a great amount of compassion, knowledge, and character.</p>

<p>When he saw me, he instinctively knew to help her bring me in. They set me down on the
couch, and he went into his kitchen, I assumed to get whatever necessary bandage and
disinfectant supplies necessary to temporarily heal me until the hospital. She followed
him and they talked quietly, once an awhile looking at me, and then going back to speaking
with each other.</p>

<p>They stopped, and he knelt down by me, and I held out my wrists. First came the cold
disinfectant cream, and I winced at the feeling of clashing temperatures hitting the
wound. He cleaned away the blood, and then I felt the pain which, up until now, the shock
had held in check. I was surprised that two small holes, and I do mean small, could hurt
that much. He started the bandaging.</p>

<p>"You're a very lucky young man." He told me.</p>

<p>"You think I don't know that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose you do. May I ask you what your name is?"</p>

<p>"Pat." I said. "And yours?" Even though I already knew it.</p>

<p>She interjected. "He's just Giles. And I'm Buffy. I slay vampires."</p>

<p>"Really?" I asked with mock surprise.</p>

<p>She grinned widely. "So Pat, I don't remember seeing you before."</p>

<p>How was I supposed to do this? "That's cause I'm not usually out at night."</p>

<p>"Any particular reason you chose to be out tonight?" Giles asked.</p>

<p>As he switched to my other wrist, he brushed up against my knee, and I hissed. He looked
at me, silently asking what had caused the pain.</p>

<p>"They're just scraped," I assured him, and then got back to his question. "I don't know.
Boredom? I guess I always wanted to see if vampires could be hurt in their lower regions."</p>

<p>Buffy gaped. "You didn't." When I didn't say anything, I got to see angry Buffy up close
and personal. "What could you possibly -?"</p>

<p>Giles cleared his throat, and I prayed in thanks for him stopping her impending tirade.</p>

<p>"You can reprimand him later, Buffy, but what he needs now is professional medical care.
Do you have family we would call for you?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, but they're nowhere near here."</p>

<p>They both stared at me for a minute, as if waiting for an explanation. Seeing that I
wasn't going to give them one, Buffy finally said something.</p>

<p>"Well I don't want to leave you there by yourself, but there's no way I'm staying
overnight. I'll call my friend Willow. She won't mind."</p>

<p>"I don't want to put anybody out." I said, not really putting up much of an argument.</p>

<p>"You're not."</p>

<p>She picked up the phone, and then Giles was lifting me off the couch. We were headed out
to the car. I had many objects to my current position, the biggest one being that I didn't
enjoy being this dependent on others, but I kept silent.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>I laid in the hospital bed, looking around the room. Every hospital room, in every
hospital, no matter what state, is always identical. A bed, a non-working twenty year old
TV, and it always feels the same. Cold and impersonal. It was nothing new to me. I had had
IV's in my arm before, nurses coming in and never giving me a moment's peace, never
letting me move, giving me blood…the only difference this time was that I didn't have
casts and it was only a one night stay.</p>

<p>But a hospital bed was better than riding in Giles' Citrogen. It felt like a billion
mini-earthquakes. I was happy to have survived the horror. And in case you're wondering,
I'm not exaggerating.</p>

<p>I had insisted on the short stay, and the doctors didn't argue. They needed all the space
for patients they could get. Around about the third time I counted the 123 tiles on my
side of the room, it was really late and I wasn't expecting any visitors. But then, Willow
poked her head in the room, being quiet just in case I was asleep. I smiled at her, and
she came in, gently closing the door behind her. She was carrying a balloon and a small
teddy bear.</p>

<p>Only Willow.</p>

<p>The redhead had changed a lot, but had also remained very much the same. Seeing her in
person now, it was hard not to smile when she was in the room. It was like her presence
had forced the hospital room to seem more cheerful and me as well. She certainly was one
of a kind, and I hoped she never lost her uniqueness. I couldn't even grasp it now. I was
a fool to even assume I could guess what made her tick.</p>

<p>She made the controversial changing of sexual orientations seem so effortless, and not
even that big of a deal. You couldn't define this girl. There weren't enough words in the
dictionary. She was simply Willow, and you were drawn to her. I know I was. She loved
every person that crossed her path, not judging them by appearances, and most people tried
to be as good as she hoped they were. The ones that weren't good, she still tried to help.
How extraordinary is that?</p>

<p>And the people she felt affection for on a deeper level, well, I was extremely envious of
them. Could they even appreciate how lucky they were? I knew I was lucky just being in the
same room with her. That made me feel special, and also undeserving. But that didn't mean
that I wasn't going to enjoy every moment of time she chose to spend with me. Because I
was. When would I ever get this chance again?</p>

<p>"Hi there." She said to me with a wave. "Sorry I took forever. I was down at the gift
shop, and they told me they were closed, and then I had to fight with them, and then some
nurse told me visiting hours were over and then -"</p>

<p>I had to chuckle. "You didn't have to go through all that trouble."</p>

<p>"It was no trouble. And yes I did. I'm a firm believer in gifts. They must be given.
Especially with you being attacked and all. Shudder." She said, and then she actually did
shudder. "I know what a big, un-fun that is."</p>

<p>"Well, I appreciate the bear." It was oddly very comforting. "Yeah, Buffy was there just
in time."</p>

<p>"She always is. I never doubt it."</p>

<p>There was a silence then. It was strange, being here like this. I knew nearly everything
about her, every single detail, but she knew nothing about me. For instance, I knew she
couldn't stand long silences, and she would break it soon. As soon as I thought that, she
began to speak.</p>

<p>"You're name's Pat?" I nodded. "Oh, I'm Willow. But you probably already knew that cause
Buffy probably told you I was coming, but I should've said…sorry." She smiled and blushed.
It was the cutest thing I'd ever seen. "I babble. It's a habit."</p>

<p>"I like it." I told her honestly.</p>

<p>"So where are you from?"</p>

<p>Uh oh. Lie, I said to myself. But I couldn't lie to Willow. "Pennsylvania."</p>

<p>"Really?" She asked, surprised. "Isn't that far away?"</p>

<p>"About three-thousand miles." Why couldn't I shut up?</p>

<p>"Is your family back there?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"How'd you end up here?"</p>

<p>"I've been…living with an uncle…but one night he didn't come home." I had no choice but to
lie now, Willow or not. What was I going to say?</p>

<p>Then came the frown and sympathetic expression. I felt like the lowest scum on the face of
the Earth.</p>

<p>"Vampires?"</p>

<p>"I guess. I'm not sure."</p>

<p>"No wonder you were out by yourself." Did she think I was trying to go vigilante on the
vampires? "I get it," She was grabbing my hand now. Oh God. I really got myself into a
hole. "But you could've gotten seriously hurt. Or worse. Promise me you'll be careful from
now on?"</p>

<p>I looked into her eyes. "I promise."</p>

<p>She smiled at me. "Good." She switched to worry almost immediately. "You haven't been
living by yourself, have you?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, but not long."</p>

<p>"Well, we can call your parents in Pennsylvania, and -"</p>

<p>"No." I told her, shaking my head quickly. "I moved out here…uh…hoping to start out on my
own. Till I could get a job I stayed with my uncle. I don't want my parents to know I
bombed."</p>

<p>"Then we'll figure something else out." She left it that.</p>

<p>I knew she would. Parents weren't a pleasant subject for any of the members of the gang.
It was soon after that, when I remembered how tired I was. And I was comforted, knowing
that she wasn't going to move from the chair she was sitting in, until I left the next
day, still feeling less than deserving of her attention.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>In the morning, when I woke up, Willow was standing over me. She had a wheelchair sitting
by my bed, and I guessed I was supposed to get in. After some fiddling with the bed
controls and a little assistance, I was in. She informed me that the Physical Therapy room
had a whole stock of crutches, so I could get replacements. Once I did, and she helped me
weasel out of paying for them (I didn't have medical insurance. Not * here *, anyway.), I
went back to my room to change out of the stupid gown and then I was out of there.</p>

<p>As we walked out, I began to dwell on the fact that I was in Sunnydale. I had no idea how
I came to be there, I just remember walking down the street with vampires following me
last night, and not given a second thought to where I was. You didn't think I knew that
Sunnydale was a fictional town? As well as everybody in it? But I just knew the place, and
a few people so well, and they seemed real enough to me. They couldn't have been solely
products from a writer's brain.</p>

<p>Therein lied my dilemma. I didn't belong here. And I couldn't tell anyone who I really
was, or what they were. But I wasn't in a rush to leave. I was living every fan's dream,
and entering into Buffy's world for me had been second nature. I guess that's what happens
when you watch something for four years. I got to know it better than my own town. Anyway,
it must have been summer, because they didn't seem in any rush to figure out how to beat a
big, bad evil. If I guessed right, it was a little after "Restless".</p>

<p>That meant it would be more or less normal. And that was fine with me. I was used to a
normal, non-apocalyptic, lifestyle. Plus, I had already been in mortal danger, and the
thrill of getting attacked by real vampires ended as soon as I saw them. I welcomed the
boredom of the off-season I never got to see before. That meant the only character, no,
person I wouldn't get to see was Riley, because he had returned home the summer. That was
a shame too, because I really wanted to shake his hand. He had survived pretty gruesome
stuff. But now I had to take a step back, and realize what I had been through.</p>

<p>I had been down Main Street, attacked by vampires, injured, saved by Buffy, inside Giles'
house, bandaged by him, in Sunnydale General Hospital, talked with Willow, given a bear…it
took every ounce of my self-control to not laugh giddily. When we reached the
entrance/exit, I caught sight of Giles standing by his car. I grimaced, knowing all too
well, the ride I was in for.</p>

<p> Willow must have sensed my apprehension, because she leaned in close and whispered to me.</p>

<p>"It's got good seatbelts. That's a plus, right?"</p>

<p>It certainly was.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Xander and Anya had apparently decided to come along for the ride. Was I being punished?
She was the last person I wanted to see. Xander was cool, however lacking in direction,
but I could have done without Anya. None of us knew what to say. Willow did quick
introductions, but I could see that she wasn't very fond of Anya either. I sat in the
passenger seat up front, and spent most of the trip back to Giles' talking with Willow.</p>

<p>"So you're a hacker?" I asked in my best 'I had no clue' voice.</p>

<p>"Yep. And a wicca too." She wasn't sure I knew what that was, so she explained further.
"Wiccas are witches. But good ones."</p>

<p>"So you're not evil?"</p>

<p>"Nope. No evil here. Just your ordinary, good guy."</p>

<p>"You don't seem ordinary to me."</p>

<p>It was then that I realized some things. One was that I was flirting with Willow. That was
a dumb move on so many levels, and I hope I don't have to explain why. The other thing I
noticed through the rearview mirror, was that Anya had been staring at me almost the
entire way.</p>

<p>"Yes?" I asked, addressing her.</p>

<p>"Are you hiding something?" She asked, flat out.</p>

<p>Now I was in trouble. Anya did always seem to have a keen perception of things. Willow
quickly reversed the topic of conversation. I don't know why she did it, but I wasn't
going to pass up my "Get Out of this Conversation Free' card.</p>

<p>"So what do you like to do?" Willow inquired.</p>

<p>"Uh…I write."</p>

<p>"Really? What about?"</p>

<p>I had to play this right, or it could blow up in my face.</p>

<p>"A lot about vampires, actually. I think they're interesting." It was a version of the
truth anyway.</p>

<p>And like Obi-Wan said, truth depends on your point of view. I almost made myself feel
better.</p>

<p>Xander decided to chip in. "Interesting isn't how I'd label 'em. Horrifying sounds a
little more accurate."</p>

<p>"I found that out."</p>

<p>Willow slapped him. "Xander!"</p>

<p>"What?" He asked.</p>

<p>"Hey! I'm the only one who gets to slap him!" Anya yelled.</p>

<p>Giles had to intervene. "Children! We're almost there. Could you please be civilized?"</p>

<p>"Sorry, Giles." Willow apologized.</p>

<p>"Yeah, sorry." Xander said.</p>

<p>Anya didn't say a word.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>It was decided that I'd stay at Giles' until they could think of a more permanent
solution. I was supposed to start college soon, and wouldn't it be funny if I ended up
going to UC Sunnydale and living there? It was all too bizarre. But that was later. Now, I
was simply enjoying my time here, because I knew it wasn't going to last forever.</p>

<p>Later that night I was taken to the Bronze, after going by the Mini-Golf course, for a
nine-hole round. Yes, there is a course in town. The writers flubbed. Buffy had spent the
morning with her mom, and then had met us at the course. She made it a point to tell me
not to use my new crutches as weapons to foolishly attack vampires, but then she let it
drop. And I officially thanked her for saving my life.</p>

<p>Okay, back to mini-golf.</p>

<p>Let's just say I wasn't very good at it at first. Swinging a club while balancing on one
crutch was a talent I had not yet mastered. But then, Xander came up with a rather
ingenious idea. I was surprised. He removed the crutch tip from the crutch my right hand
was gripping, and replaced it with a club head. I had better control and balance that way.</p>

<p>But I still wasn't that good of a golfer.</p>

<p>"Swing through it. Bring your arm back. This is the windmill so you're timing has to be
perfect." He was offering me tips.</p>

<p>I had to refer to the scorecard. "This from a guy who's at plus five."</p>

<p>Anya glared at me, but Buffy and Willow made a long drawn out 'ooh' sound.</p>

<p>"He zinged you, Xand." Buffy said.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Buff. I know. I was there." Then he smiled. "But I've still got a lower score."</p>

<p>I let him win that. Even though I saw him cheat.</p>

<p>Like I said, after Mini-Golf, the sun was just about down and we went to the Bronze.
Willow started telling me all about it. I think she liked playing tour guide.</p>

<p>"There was a weird lightning storm last night," She was saying, "It only lasted like a
couple minutes, but it knocked the power out. They weren't sure if they were going to
open."</p>

<p>They obviously had though, because people were entering the club in droves. It was
extremely loud inside. I mean loud. There was no band, so they had some techno stuff
blaring throughout the club. Xander was drink guy, and went over to the bar. We got a
table, and sat down. I looked around, remembering all the stuff that had happened here. I
could see it so clearly, and it made me shiver.</p>

<p>The Harvest, Darla with two nine millimeters, Oz's werewolf rampage, Vampire Willow's take
over…</p>

<p>It didn't seem to bother them, though, and I found myself wondering why. I mean, I had
just been watching it happen, but to them, they had lived it. Yet they still came here. I
concluded that unless I had lived through it, I would never truly understand their
mindsets. After a few minutes, another blonde shyly came up to the table. I knew who it
was.</p>

<p>"Tara!" Willow said immediately. You could hear the happiness in her voice.</p>

<p>"Hey." Tara said with a smile, but so softly I could barely hear her.</p>

<p>She looked at everyone, and when she passed by me, she looked at me a little longer. I
knew part of it was probably because she hadn't seen me before, but there was something
else in her eyes. Willow saw her looking at me, and chastised herself.</p>

<p>"I'm such an idiot! Tara, this is Pat. He's…a friend."</p>

<p>"Hi." I said.</p>

<p>Tara gave me a small smile. Willow rose from her seat and went over to her.</p>

<p>"Wanna…um…dance?"</p>

<p>The blonde nodded. I could tell they didn't want to give away much about they're
involvement around me. I didn't blame them. I watched them head into the dancing crush,
and a few seconds later, Xander and Anya announced they were going to follow suit. It was
just Buffy and I at the table then.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>I knew the distracted expression on Buffy's face, and I could read her like a book. She
was depressed. It might have been because Riley wasn't there and she didn't have a dancing
partner, but I had a feeling it was something else. And no, I don't dance. I would've
ended up crushing her toes, and the last thing Sunnydale needed was an out of commission
slayer.</p>

<p>"What's up?"  I couldn't stand to see her sad. She didn't smile enough.</p>

<p>"My love life's not that interesting." She said to me. I could tell she didn't mean to say
that. It just slipped out.</p>

<p>"Somehow I doubt that."</p>

<p>"It's pretty much a downer."</p>

<p>"But you still have one." I pointed out. I didn't, but I was working on it. Or I planned
to before I ended up here.</p>

<p>"It's not all it's cracked up to be. Always ends up that badness beats out the good
stuff."</p>

<p>"Everything relationship is rocky at times."</p>

<p>"I don't just get a few rocks. I get avalanches."</p>

<p>"I know." I said with a sympathetic tone.</p>

<p>"How could you?"</p>

<p>I knew I was going to slip up. "I just meant, given your line of work, you must have a lot
more baggage than other people who aren't…vampire slayers."</p>

<p>"Oh." She looked like she bought it. "You could say that."</p>

<p>"What's wrong with the relationship you're in now? You are in -"</p>

<p>I was interrupted by a cocky British voice that I knew could only belong to one person.
Well, he wasn't a person at all, really.</p>

<p>"Well look at Blondie doing charity work. Who's the cripple?"</p>

<p>"Shove it, Spike." She hissed at him, and looked at me. "He's just being an asshole cause
he can't bite anymore."</p>

<p>I pretended to be shocked. "He's a vampire?"</p>

<p>"That's right." Spike declared. I finally saw the bottle of alcohol he was carrying. "I'm
the baddest vampire there ever was. So be scared."</p>

<p>"Little drunk?"</p>

<p>"What's it to you, Stick Boy? Sod off."</p>

<p>I saw Buffy looking at my crutches lying under the table. I knew what she wanted to do,
and I nodded, giving the okay. She grabbed one, and with lightning fast speed, she gave
him a good shot to his undead manhood. He dropped his bottle, which shattered on the
floor, as he dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>"I thought crutch-to-vampire groin shots were a no-no."</p>

<p>She smiled. "He's the exception to the rule. He looks hurt. Think we should get him a
wheelchair?"</p>

<p>"No!" He screamed suddenly. "I can walk out of here on my bloody own, thank you very
much!" He was obviously thinking about his previous wheelchair confinement, which Buffy
had caused.</p>

<p>True to his word, he stumbled out, and Buffy finally laughed. That pleased me to no end.</p>

<p>"I feel better."</p>

<p>"Glad to hear it."</p>

<p>The smile slowly dwindled, though, and she sighed. "Okay, you know how when certain
distractions aren't around, you start thinking about things you know you're better off
just ignoring?"</p>

<p>It took me a minute to follow her question. "Yeah…what kind of a distractions are we
talking about?"</p>

<p>"One distraction actually. Riley. He's my boyfriend. I just called him a…" She frowned.
"That sounded really bad, didn't it?"</p>

<p>"I know what you meant. So what don't you want to be thinking about?"</p>

<p>"God, I can't believe I'm telling you this…Willow and I, we've been best friends ever
since I moved here, but this year we kinda drifted a little. Riley was a big part of that.
Not that I'm saying it's his fault, but…" She shut her eyes, and when she opened them
again she looked a little less strained. "Since he left, we've been reconnecting, and
feelings have been -"</p>

<p>She cut herself off, and I followed her gaze to the two dancing wiccas. I knew who she was
looking at.</p>

<p>"You love her, don't you?" I asked gently.</p>

<p>She didn't look at me. She was still looking at them. "Yeah."</p>

<p>"But she's with Tara, isn't she?"</p>

<p>Now she faced me. "It's that obvious, huh?"</p>

<p>"I think it's sweet." She just stared at me. "But you obviously don't."</p>

<p>"No…well…I'm happy for her…really…"</p>

<p>"But you want to be the blonde she's dancing with."</p>

<p>"See my problem?"</p>

<p>I did. All too clearly. It was one thing writing about them getting together, but to see
the feelings there in front of me, it was like vindication. I could help Buffy out, but
did I really want to get directly involved in their lives? If I did, people were going to
get hurt, and I didn't know if I could do that.</p>

<p>"Just gotta deal, I guess." She said after a little bit. "Thanks for listening. And not
freaking."</p>

<p>"No problem."</p>

<p>Dilemmas, dilemmas…</p>

<p>The next day, I woke to Giles offering me scones, which I tried as politely as possible to
decline. I had to crash on the couch, and as I stretched, it was then that I realized I
was starting to develop an odor.  I needed a shower, but I had no change of clothes. Once
that became an issue, they would suggest that we go to my "uncle's" house to get clothes.
That would be bad. So I immediately told Giles that when I found my "uncle" dead, the
place had been ransacked and robbed.</p>

<p>That led to a suggestion from Giles. One I had not anticipated. Spare clothes from Xander.
It would be no problem, Giles said, and went to call him. I had a couple problems with
this. First was size. Xander was taller than I was. I was as tall as Buffy, and she just
barely reached his shoulders. Second, was dread at Xander's wardrobe. I remembered very
clearly what Riley had to wear, and I feared I was in for the same fashion nightmare.</p>

<p>Ignoring the headache I had just developed, Willow and Buffy then entered the house. No
Tara though. Poor girl. She could probably sense Buffy's jealousy and decided to stay
away. I wouldn't have minded talking to her, because there were things I wanted to ask.
They sat on either side of me, Willow her usual cheery self, and Buffy once again seeming
worried about something. Why couldn't she be happy for more than two minutes?</p>

<p>It was then that I saw that Willow had carried in a box of donuts with her. Yes, it was
official. I loved this hacker. She must have seen the euphoric expression on my face at
the sight of the donuts, because she figured it all out.</p>

<p>"The scones?" I nodded. Not another word was said on the subject.</p>

<p>We dug into the bakery marvels, and Buffy downed all the jellies in less than five
minutes. She hadn't said a word to either of us since she had arrived. I had to ask Willow
what was up. Giles finally got off the phone, and Buffy moved to intercept him.</p>

<p>"We've gotta talk." She said to him, and they had another 'private' meeting in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>I looked at them, and they were engrossed. Willow looked around conspiratorially, and
leaned in close to me. She sniffed me first, scrunching her nose.</p>

<p>"Soap is a wonderful invention. Don't you remember the 'Rubbery Ducky' song?" As quickly
as she said that, she was back on topic, not even giving me a chance to respond. "She got
a call from Angel."</p>

<p>Uh oh. That could mean so many different things. "And that is?" I hated having to play
dumb.</p>

<p>"Really bad breakup. He…he's a vampire. With a soul."</p>

<p>She seemed worried about giving away more. "I think I'm better off not knowing details."</p>

<p>She sighed in relief. "He called her, but it doesn't have anything to do with them. Well,
not directly. Faith's trial starts today."</p>

<p>Whoa boy. Angst city there. I guess I must have looked confused, because Willow began to
apologize.</p>

<p>"Duh! You don't even know who she is! Sorry." Buffy was coming back over. "She's a
sensitive area for Buffy. Angel thinks she should be at the trial though."</p>

<p>She clamped her mouth shut, and pretended as if we hadn't spoken.</p>

<p>"I'm going." Buffy announced, and then glared at Giles.</p>

<p>"I think she would appreciate you being there, Buffy." Giles said. "Faith has been
unpredictable, but I have no reason to doubt what Angel says. And you saw her turn herself
in."</p>

<p>"What is it with you and logic?" Buffy asked him.</p>

<p>"We'll go with you." Willow said, referring to the two of us. "Backup support's always
good, right?"</p>

<p>Three days in this "reality" and I was already doing a crossover?</p>

<p>"I don't know if I should. I mean, you barely know me."</p>

<p>Was I trying to say I didn't want to go? Because that certainly wasn't what I was
thinking.</p>

<p>"No, it's okay. Might help. An unbiased, neutral opinion might keep me from doing
something incredibly stupid." Buffy said.</p>

<p>Unbiased? I didn't know about that. But I did know Faith's side of things and could
understand where she was coming from. Enough to be fair at least. And like I could stop
Buffy from doing anything.</p>

<p>"I'm in." I said simply.</p>

<p>"But first, he needs -" Willow started.</p>

<p>"A shower." Buffy said.</p>

<p>And as if on cue, Xander arrived with clothes.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>I came downstairs twenty minutes later, showered and dressed. I was wearing a “Sunnydale
High” T-shirt that was about two sizes too big, and baggy, leopard-spotted pants. I almost
tripped twice on the way down. Damn Xander. I had a scary thought that the pants were from
his male stripper days, which came as a result of his failed road trip. I felt like an
idiot, but of course, Buffy and Willow did nothing to make me feel any better.</p>

<p>They were holding back laughter, no, trying to. They weren’t doing a very good job of it.</p>

<p>“Well…you never know,” Buffy said in an attempt to be consoling, “you could start a
trend.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. You’re a pioneer.” Willow contributed.</p>

<p>“And I’ll have you know, those pants got me the most…uh…tips.” Xander added in his own
defense.</p>

<p>He got a glare from me.</p>

<p>I had been right then, about where the pants had come from, and I tried to shake away the
bad mental images. That pushed the girls over the edge. They laughed until they were red
in the face. Thankfully, Giles spared me any comments, but that didn’t change the fact
that I knew what he was thinking. Eventually, Buffy calmed down and wiped tears from her
eyes.</p>

<p>My embarrassment amused her. Wonderful.</p>

<p>“We’ll hit the mall after we back. I swear.” She grinned. “Courtesy of mom’s credit card.”</p>

<p>Willow saw how uncomfortable I was, and I think Xander was enjoying this. To get back at
me for mini-golf the other day.</p>

<p>“We ready?” I asked, already out the door.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>I had always wondered how one got from Sunnydale to LA, and it was by traveling by way of
the less than spectacular public transportation system. The bus was cramped and smelled
like urine, but for something that cost less than a dollar to ride, I guess I shouldn’t
have expected much. Still, hadn’t anybody ever heard of the word “sanitary”?</p>

<p>What I was really expecting, though, was that once we had crossed the town’s border, to be
in LA in less than a second. I mean, since it was a TV show, I had never seen outside of
the “one Starbucks” town. ANGEL, after all, was a completely different show. It had a
darker tone, a larger, more shadowy city…you know what I mean. But they were connected.</p>

<p>It was a two-hour ride to Angel’s city, and the three of us had seen enough “human”
weirdos to last us a lifetime.</p>

<p>Thinking back, it occurred to me that before my arrival, that I wasn’t even watching the
show at the time I left the familiar surroundings of my room. I was now convinced that I
wasn’t trapped within the confines of a two-hour long, “WB New Tuesday” programming
lineup. This was a world, and even though it wasn’t mine, it was very real. It existed
somewhere.</p>

<p>It was exciting, but scary. Vampires were real, a danger, and I didn’t even know if I
could get home.</p>

<p>Buffy, wanting to get her mind off what she was going to have to deal with in a few
minutes, noticed that I was preoccupied with these deep thoughts. We were walking to ANGEL
INVESTIGATIONS now, and she decided to ask me what exactly I was thinking about. That was
a mistake.</p>

<p>“Alternate dimensions.” I said calmly, not really thinking about what I was saying.</p>

<p>“I know I’ll probably regret this, but…why?” She asked.</p>

<p>Oh, this was fun.</p>

<p>“Uh…it’s a hobby?” Great answer.</p>

<p>“Collecting stamps is a hobby. It’s boring, but it’s a hobby.”</p>

<p>“So you’re saying you don’t buy the ‘dimensions’ thing.”</p>

<p>“Not for a second. But if it helps, they exist.”</p>

<p>Right. I remembered her trip to that Hell dimension in “Anne”. I needed to not talk about
this, anymore though, and the quicker I changed the subject, the better. Even though it
was going to get me into trouble.</p>

<p>“You’ll feel better if you just tell her. At least then –”</p>

<p>She didn’t waste any time. She clamped her hand over my mouth, which compromised my
balance for a second. She looked around for Willow frantically, and I turned to look as
well. Our companion was a few feet behind us, talking to a woman who was selling flowers
on the sidewalk. We ceased our walking, and stood there, waiting for her to complete her
transaction. Buffy turned to me, and spoke in a hushed voice.</p>

<p>“I can’t. It’s not something you tell your best *friend*. Especially when she’s with
someone else.”</p>

<p>“Hey, I’m not saying you have to take my advice, but let me ask you this. Did Napoleon
take over France by just talking about it?” She stared at me blankly. “No, he went in
there, and they handed the country over to him.”</p>

<p>“You’re saying, that if I tell her, she’ll just leave Tara for me?”</p>

<p>I shrugged. “Don’t know, but it sounded good, didn’t it?”</p>

<p>She shook her head at me, but she had a half-smile on her face.</p>

<p>“Hey guys.” We both jumped. Well actually, we just flinched in sync. “Whatcha talking
about?” Willow said to us.</p>

<p>I knew what Buffy was going to do.</p>

<p>“We were talking?” She asked me, playing dumb.</p>

<p>I had to go along with it. What? I didn’t want to have bruises for the next month.</p>

<p>“I don’t remember talking.”</p>

<p>She nodded to Willow. “See? No talk.”</p>

<p>“Uh huh…” Willow said skeptically.</p>

<p>The disbelieving redhead was carrying several flowers.</p>

<p>“What are they for?” I asked her, quickly.</p>

<p>“Buffy said that Angel’s office is a little on the dark and gloomy side. Brightening it up
can’t hurt, right?”</p>

<p>She then started walking ahead of us, and for a minute we just stood watching her in
amazement. If Buffy didn’t say anything to her, I was seriously considering saying
something. Willow was just…well anyway; we eventually got ourselves in gear, and began to
follow after her.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The three of us waited, rather uncomfortably, for Angel to come up from his basement home.
I had only seen one season of ANGEL so far, and I was a little more nervous in Los Angeles
than I was in Sunnydale. It was just different. There were no recognizable locations.
Well, the only one I had seen with any detail, besides the place I was currently standing
in, were the offices of Wolfram and Hart. I had no desire to set foot anywhere near there.</p>

<p>So like I said, we were waiting on Angel, looking at one another. From Cordelia to Wesley,
and back and forth. Tension. The brunette was never very fond of Buffy, and having grown
so much, I don’t think she liked being reminded of the past she left behind. Wesley also
left Sunnydale on less than pleasant terms, losing his Watcher title as a result of
meeting Buffy. Plus, I don’t think my presence, a stranger, helped much.</p>

<p>Willow decided she was going to break the silence.</p>

<p>“So…Faith…trial…”’</p>

<p>“Yes, who would have thought –” Wesley began.</p>

<p>“They better give her a long sentence.” Buffy said in a tone that implied that she
wouldn’t tolerate argument.</p>

<p>“She’s got my guilty vote.” Cordelia agreed. Then she spoke to me. It was the only thing
she said to me the entire time. “Xander dressed you, huh?”</p>

<p>I nodded with a grimace. Damn Xander.</p>

<p>There was a stillness then, because we all knew if there was a disagreement, a yelling
explosion would follow. And Wesley looked like he wanted to offer a counterpoint. I prayed
he wouldn’t, and I wasn’t even religious. That’s when Angel made his appearance, and
that’s when the tension reached a whole new level. Mainly between the two ex-lovers.</p>

<p>Angel saw me, and automatically knew I didn’t belong. That meant I was under suspicion,
and not even Buffy would be able to protect me. Anyhow, the brooding vampire and I got
into a staring match, until once again, Willow stepped in. I was muttering “thank yous”
under my breath. Angel’s eyes scrutinizing me…talk about intimidating.</p>

<p>“Hi, Angel. I brought flowers.” Willow said to him.</p>

<p>He finally looked away from me, and smiled at her. “Thanks. They look nice.”</p>

<p>Cordelia went to take them. “I’ll go put them in water…or something.” She hurried off.</p>

<p>“We going?” Buffy asked then. She wanted to be out of there, and frankly, so did I.</p>

<p>“In a minute.” Angel answered her.</p>

<p>His eyes shifted to me again, and then he walked into his office. I knew I was supposed to
follow, even though I really didn’t want to.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Once I was inside, he gestured to the empty chair that was in front of his desk. I sat,
and placed my crutches on the floor. He watched. He shut the door, and sat on the edge of
his desk, getting as close to me as possible, to be as intimidating as possible, without
being completely in my face. I didn’t like where this was leading. After a few moments, he
looked at my bandaged wrists.</p>

<p>“Sunnydale’s Vampire Welcome Wagon.” I answered his unvoiced question.</p>

<p>“Where are you from?” He asked, speaking to me for the first time.</p>

<p>No introductions or pleasantries. He got right to it. I usually liked that about him, but
not right now, obviously. I knew he could see there was something I was hiding, so I
figured it was better if I was straight with him.</p>

<p>“Pennsylvania.”</p>

<p>“Where are you from?”</p>

<p>He wanted the truth; he was going to get it. I’d give him an out, first, though.</p>

<p>“It’s complicated. I am from there, but not…look it’s just complicated.”</p>

<p>“Try me. I’m a complicated guy.”</p>

<p>I took a deep breath before going further.</p>

<p>“I know.” He was silent, knowing I had more to say. “You’re a two-hundred and forty-seven
year old, souled vampire. You fed off a gypsy in Romania in 1898, while your sire, Darla,
watched. You were cursed some time later by her clan, and some hundred years later, you
were in New York, starving. Four years ago, a guide from the Powers That Be came to you.
His name was Whistler.” I stopped, looking for a reaction from him.</p>

<p>He seemed to study me. “You’re not a demon.”</p>

<p>“Nope. Just a kid who watches a lot of TV. I don’t know why I’m here, but I am.”</p>

<p>If he was surprised that I knew such intimate details of his life, or unlife rather, he
didn’t show it.</p>

<p>“Different dimension?” I shrugged. Probably, but I wasn’t sure. “You didn’t tell them.”</p>

<p>I frowned. He made it seem like a bad thing. “Seemed like a good idea at the time.”</p>

<p>His face remained stoic. “After.” He got off his desk.</p>

<p>Tell them after the trial? I gulped, and reached for my crutches. Arguing would have done
me no good. At least this meant I wasn’t considered a threat, and he probably had things
he wanted to ask me, but he had other things on his mind at the moment. Telling them would
change everything, but I don’t think he was giving me a choice.</p>

<p>“Okay.” I said, giving in.</p>

<p>He opened the door, and went out ahead of me. I was right behind him.</p>

<p>“Nice clothes, by the way.”</p>

<p>I could hear the amusement in his voice. Damn Xander.</p>

<p>“Oh, my name’s Pat. It’s good to finally meet you. Liam.”</p>

<p>He turned around sharply, looking at me in disbelief because I knew his real name.
Finally, I got a reaction out of him. Shook him up some, and needless to say, I was very
pleased with myself.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Wesley came along with us to the courthouse. Buffy stuck close to Willow because she
didn’t want to be in a position where she’d have to talk to Angel, but it did give Buffy a
chance to tell Willow what her feelings were. Even though I knew she wasn’t going to.
Angel, Wesley and I reached the door to the courtroom first, and watched Kate Lockley and
two other officers lead Faith in. She was handcuffed.</p>

<p>Wolfram and Hart was a defense firm, and I knew they wouldn’t be involved. Not in any
open, legal way. I looked over at Buffy, and she was looking at Faith with so much hatred,
I felt a chill. The two slayers locked eyes, and Faith got the brunt of that chill before
disappearing into the room. I hated someone too, but it wasn’t the Bostonian. It was Kate.</p>

<p>I know she lost her father, and I felt bad for her and understood her attitude towards
Angel for awhile, but then she took it too far. I hoped that she would take out her claws
soon, because she and Angel could be allies, perhaps more. They were alike in a lot of
ways.</p>

<p>Where was I? Oh, then we all filed in, and took a seat in the back. I found myself sitting
next to a handless Lindsey MacDonald. I almost screamed. He hadn’t acknowledged my
presence, but I knew he was there, and I really wanted to move. Willow was sitting on my
other side, Angel next to her, then Wesley, and Buffy on the end. Willow looked at me,
confused at my sudden discomfort, and I shook my head. I’d just have to put up with the
seating arrangement.</p>

<p>Or I thought I would. He pulled out his cell-phone, said something quietly to the person
on the other end, and got up, brushing past us all. He didn’t look very happy, and seeing
Angel didn’t help his mood. But he left without a word. Willow had been watching too, and
she turned to me after he was out of view.</p>

<p>“Did you just get the feeling that he isn’t a very nice guy?” She asked me.</p>

<p>I nodded in agreement. “And the way he and Angel looked at each other…”</p>

<p>“What happened to his hand?”</p>

<p>I knew, and before I had an answer, the judge came in, and we were rising. When she told
us to sit again, and the case was announced, the DA asked permission to approach the
bench. After hearing what he had to say, the judge called up Faith’s lawyer to her bench
as well. We were wondering what was going on. I couldn’t see Faith’s face, but I knew she
was probably nervous as hell.</p>

<p>“This is weird.” Willow said to me.</p>

<p>We were whispering.</p>

<p>“Yeah.” I agreed. I don’t know what made me go where I went next, but I did. “Your friend
Tara seems nice. Did I make her nervous? She didn’t talk much the other night.”</p>

<p>“Oh no. She’s just shy.” She was hesitant, I could tell. “And we’re not friends. Well, not
just friends.”</p>

<p>I pretended to let it dawn on me. “You’re involved?” She nodded. “That’s great.”</p>

<p>She smiled. “Yeah…it is. But I think Buffy’s still having a hard time…accepting.”</p>

<p>“You really think that’s it?”</p>

<p>That question really got her attention, but before we could continue, the judge was
addressing the room.</p>

<p>“Would the defendant please stand?” The judge asked Faith.</p>

<p>She did, and we all waited.</p>

<p>“I’ve been informed that due to a lack of evidence and potential witnesses unwilling to
step forward and testify, the District Attorney doesn’t feel confident enough to form a
case against you. I get the feeling that there is more affecting this case that I’m aware
of, but nevertheless, I have no choice but to declare a mistrial. You’re free, Miss
Wilkins.”</p>

<p>We gaped.</p>

<p>“I have heard your confession, however. I have no idea what possessed you to admit to
those crimes, but if there’s any truth to what you said, I feel as if I haven’t done my
job. But the law has its rules, and its decided to give you a second chance. I suggest
that you make the most of it. And I think it’s important that you understand that very few
people get this break.</p>

<p>“I also hope that you learned something from your few months of incarceration, and have no
desire to return there, because I guarantee you, if I ever see you in my courtroom again,
you’ll be removed from society for a very long time. Am I making myself clear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your honor.” Faith answered, her voice small.</p>

<p>“Good.” She banged her gavel, and everyone started to clear out.</p>

<p>On the way out, I heard Buffy talking to Angel.</p>

<p>“Did you have anything to do with this?”</p>

<p>“No.” He said simply, and walked ahead.</p>

<p>I caught up with her, and she saw me.</p>

<p>“I hope she realizes how lucky she is.” She was obviously angry.</p>

<p>“I’m sure she does.” I told Buffy.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>We all waited in the Los Angeles Police Department’s parking garage, for Angel and Faith.
He went inside with her to get her possessions. I didn’t think she had that many, yet they
were taking awhile. The tapping of Buffy’s foot against the asphalt by Angel’s convertible
was driving us all crazy. I knew she had a lot of feelings towards Faith, the main one at
the moment probably being jealousy (she was getting Angel’s undivided attention), but
she’d have to accept the fact that things were happening she would have no say in.</p>

<p>Finally, we saw the two of them, and Angel was carrying a duffel bag. Faith stared at the
ground as she walked to the car, not looking at any of us. He tossed the bag on the floor
by the passenger seat, and she hopped into the back. She slowly lifted her head, and
looked at Buffy. Seeing less than welcoming eyes looking back at her, she quickly looked
away.</p>

<p>Something popped into my head as I looked at Faith. It didn’t really have anything to do
with her; the thought had come more as a result of another uncomfortable silence. They
seemed common here. And during these moments of quiet, I had taken to ponder the existence
of this place, which was what I was doing now. If this was a “real” world, separate from
the one had viewed on my 13-inch box, what the hell was going on?</p>

<p>Anyway, there wasn’t enough room in the car for all of us. One more could go in the back
with Faith, and Wesley was going to ride in the passenger seat. From the looks on both
Buffy and Willow’s faces, it didn’t seem like they were going to fight over the spot.</p>

<p>“We’ll walk, and meet you there.” Buffy announced.</p>

<p>The two friends looked at me.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll ride. I’d be exhausted by the time we got there.”</p>

<p>Sweating and everything. Wouldn’t have been a pretty sight.</p>

<p>Wesley was gracious enough to help me in, and Faith and I exchanged awkward “hellos”. I
assured Buffy that I’d be okay, and then grabbing Willow’s hand, they started to walk. A
minute or so later, Angel started the car, and we were off, easily passing the two girls.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>She must have gotten the impression that I wasn’t going to judge her or that I had any
hatred towards her, because she started talking to me.</p>

<p>“Got Irish in ya?” She asked.</p>

<p>I was surprised. “How’d you know?”</p>

<p>“Could tell. Got the look. Name wouldn’t be Pat, would it?”</p>

<p>“Uh…yeah.” She was good.</p>

<p>“No way.” She seemed happy with the accuracy of her guess. “Bet you can hold your liquor
too.”</p>

<p>She was electric.</p>

<p>“Never tried.”</p>

<p>She wasn’t the same Faith though. The playfulness was still in her eyes, but I knew she
wasn’t going to drag me to a bar and get me hammered, act on her words, as she might have
done a year ago.</p>

<p>“Just kidding ya.” The smile disappeared. “How much did she tell you?”</p>

<p>“You’re apparently a sore spot.”</p>

<p>She chuckled. “She gave you the clean version.”</p>

<p>“Actually, Willow did.”</p>

<p>“Right. Red. They get their act together?”</p>

<p>What was she talking about? “Her and Tara?”</p>

<p>“No, I called that. Her and B. Looks like it finally got through.”</p>

<p>I nodded. “To Buffy? Yeah.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t tell her though, right?”</p>

<p>“How the hell…?”</p>

<p>“See, that was always the problem. No matter how much I tried to squeeze into her life, no
matter how close to the edge I got her, Red was always on her mind, and she stopped. I
wish I had someone to pull me back.”</p>

<p>How come I sensed that a change was coming in the conversation?</p>

<p>“You were in that courtroom. I know I should feel pretty damn lucky, but I wish I was
still in jail. I don’t deserve this.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“You don’t know what I did.”</p>

<p>She was closing off. Bad.</p>

<p>“Don’t have to. You deserve it.”</p>

<p>“Oh yeah?” I got her attention. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Cause you’re sorry for whatever you did.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t say I was.” She was confused.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to say the words to be sorry. The fact that you don’t think you deserve to
be out of jail, means that you care about what you did. That means you’re sorry for ever
doing it, and that’s why you deserve a second chance.”</p>

<p>She was blown away. “Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Just an eighteen year old kid with an Irish name.” I said with a smile.</p>

<p>I couldn’t see Angel in the rearview mirror, but I knew he was smiling at me. I was pretty
sure, because Wesley was. We were coming up on our destination.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Faith and I were sitting on the couch in Angel’s home, both watching Buffy pace back in
forth in front of us, her eyes fixed on Faith. Willow stood by my side of the couch, Angel
stood behind it, and Wesley was upstairs on the phone with potential clients.</p>

<p>Buffy was pacing because she was waiting for Faith’s answer on what she wanted to do. But
how could Faith make a decision under Buffy’s despising glare?</p>

<p>“Look at her.” I said to Buffy.</p>

<p>Both slayers looked at me now.</p>

<p>“What?” Buffy asked.</p>

<p>“Look at her. Really look.”</p>

<p>“What do you think I’ve been doing?”</p>

<p>“We’ll leave you two alone.” Angel said.</p>

<p>Willow, Angel and I walked into his bedroom and he closed the door. Willow sat on the bed
and sighed. It had been about a half an hour of silence, before Angel decided to break it.</p>

<p>“Do you think she’s changed?” He asked Willow.</p>

<p>“Seems like it, but with Faith…” Willow shrugged.</p>

<p>How could she think any different? She didn’t see Faith weep in the alleyway, begging
Angel to kill her. But Willow didn’t have the hatred Buffy had for the other slayer. Not
anymore, so she must seen some flicker of change in her.</p>

<p>“Maybe you should tell her.” He said next.</p>

<p>Angel was speaking to both of us. I knew what he meant for me, but I don’t think Willow
understood.</p>

<p>“Huh?” She asked him.</p>

<p>He smiled knowingly. “Think about it.”</p>

<p>I had to grin, when it clicked for me. He was talking about Buffy. Willow had the same
feelings for her, as she had for Willow? Angel seemed to think so, and he was hardly ever
wrong when it came to people. I wouldn’t have picked up on it, but that’s why he was the
vampire detective, and I wasn’t.</p>

<p>I cringed now, because I knew it was my turn. I sat next to Willow, and took a deep
breath.</p>

<p>“There’s something I gotta tell you. Well, everyone.” She looked worried. “It’s nothing
bad…”</p>

<p>“You can come in now, guys.” Buffy called.</p>

<p>I was relieved. Wouldn’t you be?</p>

<p>“When we get back.” I said to Willow after we heard the blonde’s voice.</p>

<p>She nodded and walked out, and I turned to Angel. “I will.”</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>We saw two slayers with tear-stained faces. When I saw the smiles, I wanted to cry. The
tension between them was gone, you could feel it. They looked exhausted. There hadn’t been
any screaming, which was a surprise. We would have heard them if there had been. But it
had been a heated discussion obviously, and apparently, a lot of emotions had gone into
it. I was glad.</p>

<p>Willow looked at Buffy, and then at Faith. She walked up to the brunette, and looked at
her for a few seconds. We were getting worried, and then Willow gave her a hug. When it
was over, Faith stood there, absorbing everything. She saw me, and smiled, shaking her
head in disbelief.</p>

<p>“I told you.” I said.</p>

<p>“What do you want to do?” Angel asked Faith.</p>

<p>“Uh…you hiring?” She asked. “Sunnydale’s got a slayer. A good one.” She didn’t look at
Buffy as she said that. “And I owe you.”</p>

<p>“You don’t owe me anything.”</p>

<p>“Whatever.” She shrugged. “But I want to do the right thing this time, be on the light
side, and…stick with it.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad to hear that. It’ll probably be difficult, though.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know. Anyway…I think this is a good place to start. And considering you have a
cheerleader and a…well, do you want another employee or not?” She looked unsure.</p>

<p>“I could use your help. Thank you.”</p>

<p>Faith was surprised that she was being thanked. I thought to myself that she was probably
going to be hearing that a lot now. Buffy spoke next.</p>

<p>“You know that if you ever want to…it won’t be easy, but…” She trailed off.</p>

<p>She was making an effort to close the gap between them. It was nice to see.</p>

<p>Faith grinned. “Don’t worry, B. I’ll stop by. Who knows when I’ll need to save your ass?”
She looked at Willow. “Willow, I’m…”</p>

<p>Willow smiled. “I know. Thanks.”</p>

<p>The Bostonian cleared her throat. “B, Red, I’ll catch ya later. There’s…uh…a couple people
upstairs I gotta talk to.” She started headed for the stairs, and then turned around. She
looked at Buffy and Willow. “Hope you two are happy with…whatever.”</p>

<p>I had to contain my laughter when I saw the expressions on Buffy and Willow’s faces as
they looked at one another.</p>

<p>“And Pat…thanks.” Then she made a face. “But who dressed you? A circus monkey?”</p>

<p>“He may be. I’m not sure yet.”</p>

<p>Damn Xander.</p>

<p>She headed up as I glared at Buffy and Willow, cutting off any laughter from them. A few
minutes later, Angel opened the basement exit, and we were leaving. I told the two of them
to wait for me on the corner, and then we’d walk to the bus station, because I had
something to say to Angel first.</p>

<p>“You helped her out a lot.” He said to me, referring to Faith. “But if you don’t tell
them, I will.”</p>

<p>I nodded. “I do wanna go home eventually, you know.”</p>

<p>“Hope you get there. Good luck.”</p>

<p>“Probably won’t see you again, so I just thought I’d let you know, Darla’s in the box.
Good luck with that. Got a feeling you’re probably gonna need it.”</p>

<p>And then I walked after the girls, not looking back.</p>

</table>

<p>We got off the bus into pouring rain. It had started when we were halfway to Sunnydale,
and seemed to increase immensely the closer we got to town. It didn’t rain much in
California, but when it did, Mother Nature apparently liked to pull out all the stops. We
ran, or walked quickly rather, for the cover of the terminal. There was no way we were
going to walk any further in this.</p>

<p>The last time I remember it raining on the Hellmouth was a few hours before Angel became
evil. I hoped this wasn’t another form of eerie foreshadowing.</p>

<p>"At least there’s no lightning." I yelled over the downpour.</p>

<p>Crackle. The sky lit up. The boom of thunder. I realized just exactly how stupid I was
when I saw their shaking heads. I promptly looked away. Willow spotted a payphone, and had
the brilliant idea of calling Giles and having him pick us up. As we were waiting for her,
it suddenly occurred to me that it was dark. I know what you’re thinking. I’m a moron.
Don’t I know that the sun gets blocked out during a thunderstorm?</p>

<p>Yes I do. But here was my worry. It was only five past five in the afternoon, with no sun,
and the three of us could barely see. This was Sunnyhell. Vampires would thrive now, the
bad weather having little to no affect on their vision. They had us at a disadvantage. Let
me put it this way. I kept playing this image of me standing with a ‘Come and Bite Me’
sign in the middle of ten hungry vampires.</p>

<p>Buffy was an excellent slayer, I had no doubt of that, but she was still human. Rain was
blinding, especially the torrential kind that we were in now. Add to that having us as
baggage to protect, and them probably outnumbering us, there was going to be badness no
matter how I tried to paint it. But I was probably internally panicking for nothing. Giles
would be here in a few minutes to get us, and we’d be safe in his “invitation-only” abode.</p>

<p>"There’s no answer." Willow said coming back to us.</p>

<p>The bomb dropped...and dropped…and dropped…and BLAMO! Guess I was going to be another
course on the vampiric buffet.</p>

<p>Was I being pessimistic, or what? These people, this town, didn’t survive on sheer luck
for four years. They survived because they had a very resourceful, skillful, talented,
super-strong, slayer. She knew how to handle almost any type of situation. I should have
had more confidence in her and her abilities. This was Buffy Summers. The best slayer the
world had ever had.</p>

<p>"Who wants to make a break for it?" Buffy asked us. She turned to me. "You’re not that
heavy, right?"</p>

<p>And the second bomb dropped…maybe it did pay to be pessimistic after all. But the fact
that Buffy was offering to carry me was a little bit of an upside. That passed though, and
Buffy figured caution was better. Before we could move, a car screeched to a halt on the
street next to us. It was Giles and Xander, and they were flinging open the doors. We
piled in.</p>

<p>When we started driving, Xander filled us in.</p>

<p>"Power’s out everywhere. And so are the vamps." Buffy remained silent. "There were ten at
the Bronze…well they’re scattered all over town."</p>

<p>"Weapons?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"The trunk." Giles said.</p>

<p>"Phone?" Giles handed her his cell phone. "Best purchase I ever made you make."</p>

<p>We all waited as she dialed.</p>

<p>"This isn’t going to be fun." Willow said to me.</p>

<p>"I’m getting that." I said in response.</p>

<p>"Angel, tell Faith’s she’s gonna get a chance to save my ass sooner than she thought."
Buffy said into the phone. "I need you two here. Quickly."</p>

<p>"Faith?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>She ignored his question as she hung up. "Okay, we need to –"</p>

<p>Buffy cut herself off. She screamed 'Stop' before any of us knew why. Then we saw. A
vampire was standing on the road in front of us, and Giles reacted as anyone would if they
were going to hit something. He attempted to slam on his breaks, and stop the car from
colliding. There was a lot of spinning, but eventually, his vehicle no longer moved.</p>

<p>That’s when things got worse.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Worse how, you ask? The vampire we had almost hit, was joined by several of his pals (from
what I could see through the rain-soaked windows), and began swarming the car. While my
fellow occupants were panicking because they were inside the shaking car, because
supernatural fists were smashing through the windows and both windshields, I was once
again overcome with the same feelings I had when I arrived in town.</p>

<p>Death looked to be imminent, and what a great discovery it would be. I always had a habit
of thinking that in dangerous situations. I wouldn't be afraid of dying, it happens to
everybody, so why worry about it? The people you leave behind, your possessions, the
things you never got to do…but I always rationalized that, once you're dead, you'll cease
to care about anything. It won't eat away at you. You'll be in a blissful oblivion in
"Heaven", or condemned to "Hell" where the pain is stronger than any other possible
memory. If you do remember your previous life, that is.</p>

<p>Plus, I didn't want to give these vampires the satisfaction of seeing my fear. Of course,
that's all bull. A tough shell that was easily cracked once I saw the demons faces. My
thoughts changed completely then.</p>

<p>I wasn't, and still aren't, tied to any religion. There's something out there, I'm sure,
but I'm not going to put a label on it. I use "Heaven" and "Hell" to describe good and bad
only because they're familiar terms. If I ever thought of more fitting words, I'd use
them. I say "Oh my God" simply as an expression. I don't pray, I only have the vaguest
notions of what the Bible says, and I've only been in church for weddings and funerals.</p>

<p>But with that in mind, I had no idea "where" I'd end up if my blood was drained from my
body. Limbo? Wandering the earth as some sort of spirit? Were "sins" real? Did you pay for
the bad things you did in life? How big did they have to be to get sent to "Hell"?
Everyone "sins" at some point, right?  Maybe the real "Hell" was gaining the knowledge
that living, life, was pointless, and you simply vanish. What if there's a lesson you have
to learn and you're reincarnated into another body until you get it? What if I had wasted
my life? Eighteen years. What if I threw them away? Or, what if I was wrong, and God did
exist?</p>

<p>This was what was running through my head, and just like before, the intense desire not to
die. I also had an intense feeling of being pulled out the broken window by cold hands,
and hearing people call my name. I had been holding onto the crutches, and they came with
me. I felt asphalt underneath me, felt rain stinging me relentlessly, and over the booming
of thunder, I heard Willow scream. My vision wasn't that clear, but I could make out two
vampires standing over me.</p>

<p>It was all happening so fast, and I apologize for not being more descriptive. Like I said,
I heard Willow scream, and from the sound of things she was across the street. Then I was
being kicked on the ground. Just being toyed with. The next thing I knew, I was being
lifted, and I was crying, yelling for home. My crutches fell out of my hand. Death was a
mystery I didn't want to unravel yet. Scared, terrified, those words don't seem good
enough to describe what I was feeling.</p>

<p>I did turn my head though, and I saw Buffy, Giles, and Xander scrambling to battle the few
vampires still by the car, and get out to me and Willow. As much as I cared for those
people, I wasn't really thinking much about them at the time. I turned my head back
around, and realized that the vampire holding me had been looking at my neck rather
intently. I could see the hunger. I kicked my legs, twisted my body, doing anything to get
free. Of course, it didn't work. It was then that Willow did enter my mind, and I hoped
she was faring better than I was.</p>

<p>I make it seem like I was in this predicament for hours, but in reality, it was mere
seconds. The vampire bent his head down, and I squeezed my eyes shut, waiting for the
pain. And then, I was falling, hitting the ground. I grimaced, and I may have cried out
because my arm hit the street the wrong way. And my crutches were on the ground, which my
lower back hit with pretty good force. To boil it down, I was really hurting. But a hand
pulled me up.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, mate!" It was Spike's voice. "Take your sticks and get the hell out of here."</p>

<p>"Willow…the others…" I said softly, pain evident in my voice, as I took the crutches from
him.</p>

<p>I looked over, and the trunk was open, and Buffy, Giles and Xander were armed with
weapons, destroying the rest of the vampires who had attacked us. They appeared to be in
control, but there were still more around, and I had no idea where they were. And then it
hit me. Willow. I didn't see Willow.</p>

<p>Spike looked pissed with me because I wasn't moving. "You need a hospital, don't you? The
one time I get to have any bloody fun…come on!"</p>

<p>He was dragging me away, and the last thing I saw were the three members of the gang,
having dusted the vampires, crouching down over something. But what I didn't know at the
time was, that it wasn't something. It was someone.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Getting to the hospital, getting in the hospital, was…a chore. I'm seriously doing an
injustice to that night. It was worse than an episode, any drama on the show I had ever
seen. I probably think that way, because I was in the middle of all the insanity. Never
before had a witnessed so many vampires out and in town. They were everywhere, feeding on
anyone who had the misfortune of still being on the street. It was horrible.</p>

<p>And when there weren't any people to kill, they destroyed property. Of course, our journey
was slower than it could have been, but Spike had to stop and fight every couple minutes.
He was just drawing attention to us. I didn't even know why he was helping me. I had
always wondered that since he had that chip in his head, could it have possibly triggered
some goodness buried deep within him? Which he disguised as loving to pummel other demons?</p>

<p>Sure, it doesn't seem possible, but he was saving my ass, and I wasn't going to look a
gift vampire in the fangs.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, it was hard making our way to the hospital, and even harder getting
inside. Someone in the building was intelligent, because the automatic doors that were the
only entrance we could see, were shut off, and barricaded.</p>

<p>"The morons choose tonight to grow a few brain cells?" Spike asked, making it sound like a
curse.</p>

<p>Quickly, I thought of the Emergency Room. They had to let people in there. As he went to
that side, I saw Giles' very wrecked car, still running, parked out front of the ER
entrance. Uh oh, I thought to myself. They must have passed us and I didn't see them.</p>

<p>Now I had an even more urgent need to get in there. There was another sat of automatic
doors, but this time a security guard was standing there. He looked at us through the
glass, and then around. Assuming it was safe I guess, he got his key and activated the
doors. We got inside, and were trying to will the doors to shut again. But as I should
have known, a vampire had been waiting, and rushed in with us.</p>

<p>The security guard panicked, firing his gun wildly. He nearly hit both of us, which wasn't
pleasant. And then when he ran out of bullets, he ran into the ER through the second set
of doors, leaving us there. Spike shifted to his more ridged-looking, vampire face, and
let go of me. I backed up into a corner, and sat on the floor, watching him fight with the
other vampire.</p>

<p>He definitely had the upper hand, but I noticed a slight problem. Spike wasn't strong
enough to rip his head off, so he would need a stake. But he didn't have one. I really
don't think he cared, though. He was enjoying pulverizing the demon. I looked the other
direction and saw Giles, Xander, and Buffy amongst several doctors. They didn't look
happy. I knew who was on that bed.</p>

<p>The security guard was frantic, and everyone was so engrossed that they didn't appear to
hear him. He finally got Buffy's attention though, and as she looked in my direction, she
finally snapped out of her brooding, and started hurrying over. But before she could make
it, I heard another voice. I turned my head, and saw Spike holding the vampire against the
wall. I also so Faith, Angel…and Tara.</p>

<p>"Need help?" She asked Spike, holding out a stake to him.</p>

<p>"Thanks." Spike said, taking it from her and driving it home.</p>

<p>Sire and child then stood staring at one another. You know that saying "If looks could
kill"? Well…</p>

<p>I didn't even notice that Faith and Tara had made her way over to me.</p>

<p>"You don't look so good." Faith observed.</p>

<p>"Thanks for pointing that out." I said.</p>

<p>She helped me up, grabbed my waist, and we started going to where everyone else was. I
looked at Tara, and finally saw how drenched she was. Faith noticed that I was looking at
the blonde with some confusion. Which I was. What had she been doing?</p>

<p>"We picked her up. She was walking the streets."</p>

<p>"Willow's hurt, isn't she?" Tara asked me.</p>

<p>As we got closer and looked at the gang's faces, she got her answer.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"It's too crowded in here. This woman needs blood, and she needs it fast." What I assumed
was the doctor in charge said. "Take these people out."</p>

<p>The cowardly security guard was asking us as forcefully and as politely as possible to
leave the ER. Angel approached the guard and doctor, with that intimidating walk he was so
good at. It was fun to watch when you weren't on the receiving end. Once he had their
attention, he looked in Spike's direction. The bleached vampire was still standing by the
doors.</p>

<p>"Unless you want any more interruptions," He gave the guard a look; "I suggest letting him
stay to keep watch."</p>

<p>"Fine." The doctor said. "But he better not get in my way."</p>

<p>As she said that, I looked around at all the other victims in the room. Doctors, nurses,
all rushing with blood packets around to people. It appeared that Willow wasn't the only
one nearly drained. I hoped they had enough to go around. We started to follow our
instructions and go, but Buffy wasn't moving. She wasn't doing anything. Just standing
there.</p>

<p>Tara looked at her, and she knew everything in that moment. I could tell. Sadness
flickered across her face, but was quickly replaced with concern. Willow was the only
thing that mattered to any of us, and she went up to Buffy. Gripping her shoulders, Tara
guided her towards us. The blonde slayer looked at the blonde witch, and they found
something in common finally.</p>

<p>We went to a room with couches and chairs, and there were children's drawings on the
walls. There was a TV, magazines, they tried to make it feel homey, but it was still cold,
unfeeling. All we could think of was the redhead a few halls away, and none of this was
helping. Buffy seemed to realize we were there with her, and that Angel and Faith had
arrived. I could see the slayer coming out, remembering the danger still in town.</p>

<p>The lights flickered. And the storm. We prayed that the power didn't go out.</p>

<p>Faith spoke. "Vamps are trashing the place, huh?"</p>

<p>The history with her was forgotten, at least for now.</p>

<p>"Yeah." Buffy said in confirmation.</p>

<p>"Not to mention Giles' car." Xander added. "And I'm still trying to figure out how that's
a bad thing."</p>

<p>We had a chuckle at that. Even Giles. At least it broke the tension some.</p>

<p>"What do you need us to do?" Angel asked.</p>

<p>"Go kill em." Buffy said, hating vampires with a passion she never had before. "And I'll
join you."</p>

<p>"No. Stay. We'll handle it."</p>

<p>"She needs you here." Tara said.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to let them -"</p>

<p>I could see anger in Buffy's eyes. The need for revenge, the hatred. Wanting to kill. I
saw Faith in those eyes. The brunette must have seen herself reflected in them too,
because she flinched a little, and interrupted Buffy.</p>

<p>"It's not your fault, B. They're right. Red needs you to stay. We'll get 'em. Promise."</p>

<p>Faith waited for Buffy to challenge her, but her fellow slayer simply sighed, and sank
into a chair.</p>

<p>"Where do you think most of them are?" Faith asked.</p>

<p>"The Bronze." Xander supplied.</p>

<p>"Let's go." Angel said.</p>

<p>The two of them left in silence. At least they had something to do to keep their minds off
of Willow. And that's when I remembered all the pain I was in. But there was no way that I
was going to go lay in a room now. It was a little bruising, maybe a cut or two…and then I
tried to stand on my own. "Ouch" doesn't cover it. I had adrenaline before. The kind that
blocks out all pain while you're trying to escape mortal danger, and it was wearing off
now.</p>

<p>Something had been bothering me during this whole thing.</p>

<p>"Where the heck is Anya?"</p>

<p>"I told her to stay in my house before Giles and I left. She's safe." Xander said.</p>

<p>"Lucky her."</p>

<p>I shifted in the seat, and winced some.</p>

<p>Giles noticed my pain, but then a nurse came rushing in, getting everyone's attention.</p>

<p>"What's wrong?" Tara asked before anyone else could.</p>

<p>"You're all friends of Miss Rosenberg, right?" The nurse asked.</p>

<p>"Yes." Giles said.</p>

<p>"She has a blood type of B positive, and," She was young, and exhausted, "we've run out.
Do any -?"</p>

<p>"I'm B positive." Buffy said.</p>

<p>Poor Tara. The look on her face was heartbreaking to me. She couldn't help the one she
loved, but the person who wanted to take her away, could.</p>

<p>"Then come on."</p>

<p>"This young man is injured." Giles said quickly, referring to me.</p>

<p>"Go." The nurse said to Buffy. "ER. Tell Dr. Emerson -"</p>

<p>"I got it." Buffy said, running.</p>

<p>The young nurse looked me over, asked me where the pain was, all of that.</p>

<p>"These don't appear to be fatal, you aren't losing blood,"</p>

<p>"So you're saying I'll live." I said to her.</p>

<p>She gave me a weary smile. "I'll send another nurse here, and she'll bandage you. We're
saving the rooms for most seriously injured and recovering patients. And there've been a
lot tonight. I'm sorry, but we're short-staffed, and…just don't move very much, okay? I
have to get back."</p>

<p>"Help her."</p>

<p>"She'll be fine." I was promised, and I intended to hold the nurse to that. "I'll ask the
nurse that I get to tend to you to try and get you some new clothes too."</p>

<p>Damn Xander.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>
A few hours later, I was wheeling myself through the hallways of the hospital. I had
bandages in places I didn't realize were injured. I didn't like wheelchairs, especially
the large hospital ones. Independence was a big part of that. With my crutches I was able
to get in places so much easier, they didn't take up much room, and it made me feel lazy.
Because I had gotten rid of my personal chair years ago. I wanted to use my crutches, but
the doctors wouldn't let me.</p>

<p>So, I followed their orders, and I was currently on my way to the room they said Willow
was in. She got all the blood she needed, and she was apparently resting now. The storm
was dying down, and the night was almost over. I had been there, what? Two days? It felt
like forever. Would I really be there forever? Could I get home? I didn't know, but Angel
and Faith were back home by now. From what I understood, the vampire that started the
uprising was at the Bronze.</p>

<p>Once they got rid of him, the rest backed off. All I have to say is that I was glad I
wasn't there. And now I was also glad that I was wearing normal shorts and a normal
T-shirt. I thought of Xander and Giles. They were getting coffee in the cafeteria, giving
Buffy time to sit with Willow alone.</p>

<p>I reached the redhead's room, and when I saw what I saw, I stayed quiet, and stopped just
inside the doorway. She was sleeping, and Buffy was sitting at the side of the bed,
looking at her. The room was bare for the most part, but I knew when the two men came
back, it would be filled with balloons and flowers. It was so quiet, but…how do I describe
this? How can I make you understand the relief, the emotion, the peacefulness, and the
love, on Buffy's face?</p>

<p>I don't think I can. Nor could I ever hope to describe how innocent, how beautiful, she
looked in sleep. I know Buffy blamed herself for what happened to her friend, to me, but
it was insanity out there. I didn't blame her for anything, and I knew Willow didn't
either. People may say that Willow was lucky. She wasn't. I was lucky. She's got somebody
watching her. Whatever's out there would never let her die that way. She was too special.
Correction, she *is* too special.</p>

<p>Buffy didn't have to worry about losing her. Not unnaturally anyway. The wicca/hacker had
a long life to live. I was sure of it. And she and Buffy became partners in every sense of
the word, I knew it would happy life for both of them.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, Buffy happened to look up and see me. I blushed and pretended I had
been looking at my hands.</p>

<p>"You can come in." She said to me softly.</p>

<p>I accepted her invitation, and came in, trying to make as little noise as possible. I
pulled up beside her chair.</p>

<p>"What a night, huh?" I asked with a smile.</p>

<p>She returned it. "Yeah, it sure was. I'm just glad you're both okay."</p>

<p>"Me too."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, I should've -"</p>

<p>I knew this was coming. "Forget it. Willow's fine, I'm fine. Just let it go." She thanked
me by squeezing my hand. "So the vampires just stopped?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. Faith said he was just a newbie. Guess he heard that I was out of town, and then
got his buddies riled up. As soon as he realized Faith was a slayer, he crumbled."</p>

<p>Buffy looked at Willow again. After a few seconds, I heard her say the word 'beautiful' so
quietly, she probably wasn't even aware that she said it.</p>

<p>"I'm gonna tell her, you know. When she wakes up."</p>

<p>I was hoping she'd say that. Did she realize yet what she did for her? Her blood was
flowing through Willow's veins. She saved her life in the most intimate way possible.</p>

<p>"That's good to hear." I still didn't tell her yet. I had to. I sighed. "Speaking of
telling people things…um…"</p>

<p>"You're not from this dimension. I know."</p>

<p>She was grinning, and I did a double take. "Uh…how?"</p>

<p>"Remember Willow said that that night we met you, there was a weird lightning storm?" I
nodded. "What she didn't tell you, was that she and Tara caused it. They were messing with
some sort of dimensional hole spell or something. Though they weren't supposed to be. I
promised not to tell Giles."</p>

<p>Okay. "And you knew where I was?"</p>

<p>"They said the spell showed them a vision of someone appearing on Main. I went there,
found you, and saved you."</p>

<p>"And why didn't you tell me you knew?"</p>

<p>"I liked you. I wanted to get to know you first. Wanted to see what a person from another
dimension was like. But you were pretty normal. I was a little disappointed."</p>

<p>"Hey!" And then I put hand over my mouth. I didn't want to wake Willow up.</p>

<p>"Just kidding. Besides, I didn't think it was important to make a big deal out of it.
Quick thinking with that uncle story, by the way."</p>

<p>"In my world, I do really live in Pennsylvania." Not that big of a deal? "Huh. Angel
seemed to think it was important that I tell you."</p>

<p>"Angel should just mind his own business." Buffy said with an edge to her voice. I shook
my head. "He did me a huge favor, I know."</p>

<p>My next question was pretty obvious. "Since you know it was a spell and all, how do I get
home?"</p>

<p>"When the sun comes up." Tara said quietly, entering the room.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>As soon as I saw Tara, I knew it was time to go. No one enters a room and says something
as ominous as "when the sun comes up", without intending to drastically change things.
Buffy picked up on it too. It was time to say good-bye.</p>

<p>"I'll take you to where…you need to be." Tara stuttered a little. "I'll just www…wait in
the hall."</p>

<p>Buffy looked at me guiltily as soon as the other blonde was out of sight.</p>

<p>"I feel so bad. Maybe I shouldn't…"</p>

<p>I shook my head. "You should. Tara will probably be hurt, yeah, but you can't get around
that."</p>

<p>"You're talking like Willow loves me too."</p>

<p>"She does."</p>

<p>Buffy hugged me then. "Thank you for pushing me. I don't think I'd be telling her, if you
didn't." She sat back. "You better hurry. Get home safe."</p>

<p>"Thank you. These are two days I'll never forget." I reached for the wheels. "And give
Willow a kiss for me when she wakes up."</p>

<p>She grinned like an idiot, and blushed. I turned around and started to leave.</p>

<p>"Good luck, you two."</p>

<p>That was the last thing I said to them, and then Tara was sneaking me out of the hospital.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>We went to Main Street in silence. There were no cars on the road, and the sun was getting
ready to show. We stopped for some reason, and I was tired of being in the chair, so I got
my crutches off the back, and shakily forced myself to stand. Tara finally spoke once I
was up, and she was sure I wasn't going to fall. It was then that I realized that we were
at the same spot at which I had arrived.</p>

<p>"Uh…I had to do some…researching, but the spell said that another hole would open up two
moons after the casting."</p>

<p>Two days. It all made sense. "What if I didn't make it?"</p>

<p>"Then the hole would close…and you'd be stuck here. I mean…we could've done the spell
again…but it might not have been…"</p>

<p>"My world." Great I'd go from BUFFY to doing a bad version of a SLIDERS episode, trying to
find my way home. I was no Jerry O'Connell.</p>

<p>So I guess I just had to wait.</p>

<p>"They really love each other." She said to me.</p>

<p>It wasn't a question, it was a statement.</p>

<p>"Yeah. They do. Are you gonna be okay?"</p>

<p>She nodded with a sad smile. "I told Willow she should be with the person she loves. To do
whatever made her…happy."</p>

<p>"But what about you?"</p>

<p>She was quiet, and before I could get an answer out of her, the hole was opening in front
of us. It was a bright blue light, and it didn't look very stable.</p>

<p>"I'll be okay…if we can be friends, I'll be lll…lucky. You better go."</p>

<p>I looked at her, before I moved further toward the light. My only regret of the whole trip
was not getting to know her better. But I went in, and I found myself in what I can only
describe as limbo. I glanced around me. There was nothing that spectacular. It was
nothingness, really.</p>

<p>Though, I could've sworn I saw someone passing by me, who had a remarkable resemblance to
Joss Whedon.</p>

<p>Before I could check, I was going what seemed like lightspeed, and then I found myself
here. In front of my computer, just like I had left it two days before. Had no time
passed? I checked my computer's date, and learned that here, it hadn't. Smiling, I started
to write this thing you're reading now.</p>

<p>And this is the end of the tale of my time in Sunnydale.</p>
