<P>Sam McPherson faced forward and looked straight ahead, so the teacher and the
myriad of late students trailing in behind the woman, wouldn't see two poplar
opposites conversing. She had been talking, reluctantly, with Brooke McQueen.
Her mortal enemy and the barrier between her and social advancement. Not that
she wanted in the "in crowd," she didn't. But if she ever had a mental lapse and
felt a desperate need to dye her hair and shove a stick up her ass (which would
result in her becoming a vain bitch), she wouldn't be able to because Brooke
stood in her way. Her and the rest of her clique. The Glamazons.</P>
<P>No, she was pleased with her current situation, being the Matt Drudge of
Kennedy High School. That status got her blacklisted from many events, but as
long as she was careful (and as a journalist that was a basic rule for her), she
wasn't targeted as often as the rest of the mass in the school. The little bit
of power she held came in handy. Of course her friends were often attacked in
one form or another. Carmen couldn't help but be hypnotized by the "wonderful"
group, Lily had to deal with Mary Cherry's almost frightening interest in her,
and Harrison had a pitiful attachment to Brooke. Insults, infatuations and
embarrassments aside, she, Brooke and their respective people knew their
places.</P>
<P>Except the line was blurring now. As much as they wanted to fight it, their
parents had a romantic interest in each other, and didn't take into account the
social ramifications of their eventual union. Dismissing a teenager's life and
problems was apparently a common choice made by all adults. Sam couldn't get the
notion, that there was some convention held annually that only parents attended,
where they found new ways to make their children's lives a complete and total
hell, out of her head.</P>
<P>If Brooke's father and her mother getting wed and having casual sex had no
affect on her, Sam would simply be happy for them. But it did. Two cliques on
the extreme ends of the spectrum where on a collision course. The Populars and
the Outcasts. Somewhere along the way, the nerd label got thrown into that more
general category. </P>
<P>Now that she and Brooke occupied the same living space, that inevitable clash
was more rapidly approaching. In an effort to do the responsible thing (also
known as damage control), she had come to Brooke with an idea, and thankfully
her soon-to-be stepsister had been willing to hear her out. They were both in
agreement that they didn't like the new turn of events. </P>
<P>Temporarily setting aside their never-ending, fifty bucks a ticket,
stadium-filling, worthy feud, they had agreed to negotiations. To set up rules
and boundaries. A safety net of sorts. As the two leaders, both sensible "A"
students, it would be just them this weekend, working out the details to
hopefully come to a point where the two groups could, for the most part,
peacefully co-exist. Living under the same roof meant sharing with each other,
and it meant the members of both their groups could wind up in the same space at
the same time, outside of school walls. There had to be regulations, and if she
played her cards right, Sam could get her group a higher ranking. However, they
were mostly doing this so they could see their parents feel happiness. God knows
they deserved it.</P>
<P>Sam's father died; Brooke's mother left. It wasn't fair to their parents if
they didn't attempt to do something. They didn't want to see them alone, and Sam
and Brooke knew their sabotaging efforts, and future ones, would only end up
hurting them. Which was why they had dropped off recently. The parents were
serious, and they'd try hard to respect that. </P>
<P>A fear was that the regulations would be ignored when they created them, but
all they had to do was remember that the laws of nature ruled every high school.
Whatever came out of the bargaining process would have to be obeyed by all. Or
else chaos would undoubtedly ensue. Brooke and Sam each had the respect and
admiration of every person that was part of the student body; they were the
dominant females. </P>
<P>No one else had the qualities to take over. Nicole Julian was the only
contender, and even though she could easily move up the Glamazon ladder because
of her willingness to use any ruthless method necessary, she didn't command
respect. Fear and intimidation only took you so far, and the girl was severely
outnumbered. Her regime would crumble soon after her coup. A leader she was not.
Both girls were therefore confident.</P>
<P>Sam discreetly passed Brooke a note as the class began, which read:</P>
<P>"So it's decided."</P>
<P>Brooke wrote her response. "A forty-eight hour time period."</P>
<P>"To outline a mutually acceptable truce."</P>
<P>"Don't release the doves yet."</P>
<P>Sam looked up at Brooke after she read it, and spoke aloud, but quietly.</P>
<P>"And don't get out the olive branches."</P>
<P>They were prepared for a fight. It occurred to them, from time to time, how
strange it was that hormones and age could destroy a whole mess of childhood
connections. Sam had been on the outside looking in at Brooke and Harrison's
friendship, and though she was never fully excluded, Brooke got Harrison's
undivided attention whenever the blonde was around. She believed there was a
time when she genuinely liked Brooke, and the few instances when they had hung
out, it had been fun. Despite that however, they always had a problem
establishing a friendship and never knew why. It was all or nothing with them,
yet they had no clue what that "all" was.</P>
<P>But those pre-years were ancient history. High school was revenge, and
Harrison had come to his senses. It was the present, and in the present, it was
all about reputations and other people's perceptions. In high school, whether
you were in or you were out, you had a responsibility not to disappoint. That
cycle of history repeating itself was broken for four years, and had to stay
that way, for the consequences would be far too costly. And during those times,
when there was regret, they had only to remember one thing. </P>
<P>How much they hated one another.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P>"You already wrote her obituary, didn't you?" Carmen asked worriedly. </P>
<P>She didn't like the possibilities. Two enemies forcing themselves to speak,
in a house, alone for entire weekend. Badness. Brooke was someone she happened
to be fond of. And Sam. The image of what the two girls might look like at the
end of the weekend,</P>
<P>"I have good intentions and motives that are completely pure." Sam defended
herself.</P>
<P>"For once." The sarcastic tone wasn't lost on Sam.</P>
<P>"So you'll be fair?" Lily asked.</P>
<P>"What kind of journalist would I be if I wasn't?" The more petite brunette
questioned. "I can't say the same thing for her..." Sam trailed off. She loved
making Brooke the evil one.</P>
<P>"But you're prepared if she turns on you." Carmen said.</P>
<P>"Every eventuality has been considered."</P>
<P>"Cause you're so thorough." She smirked.</P>
<P>"Of course."</P>
<P>"If you and Brooke were herbivores, you wouldn't feel the need to compete so
much, you know." Lily told Sam.</P>
<P>"Someday you'll have to explain that." Carmen shook her head. "Vegetarian
logic."</P>
<P>"Brooke and I are *not* competing! That's ridiculous!" Sam stated
emphatically. "We never have, and never will!" She walked off.</P>
<P>Why couldn't she just blindly hate Brooke? What was wrong with that? Sure,
her reasons were less than stellar, and probably not seen as that solid
considering how hard she and Brooke fought, but they were good enough. The
blonde was stuck up and uncaring. Some would argue she wasn't, but it was true,
despite objections. Besides, if they were competing, that meant she was jealous
of Brooke. And there was no way that was true.</P>
<P>"What did I say?" Lily was rightfully confused.</P>
<P>"It's Brooke." Carmen responded as if that was all that need to be said. They
both knew that whenever Brooke was nagging at their friend's brain, her
reactions didn't make sense. </P>
<P>"Carrots are a lot less aggressive."</P>
<P>"They're animals, Lily An-I-Mals." With blood that boiled whenever they were
in a room together. "Human and odd. And you remember the mutant carrots from
-"</P>
<P>"Stop!"</P>
<P>She still had nightmares about that cartoon.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P>"When's the last time you had your head checked?" Nicole asked Brooke. "If
this move doesn't go our way...have you thought about the backlash? The whole
order spins out of control, and Spam gets perverted joy out of her next
headline."</P>
<P>"Think big picture, Nic. It'll mean good press for us. Control the
information, secure our power." Brooke hated talking in such dictator-like
language, but that was the only thing her friend understood sometimes. "We get
immunity."</P>
<P>"I'm concerned about you. Really. You have no idea how delusional you sound,
do you? She loves freedom of speech so much it's sickening. If it was something
she could screw, she probably would." She pointed at her leader. "And if she
gets anything from you, she'll print it. Status is something we have to
maintain, Brookie, and if we get smeared, *I'm* the one who'll have to clean up
the mess. And if you think I'm gonna go down cause you make a wrong
decision...there's more I could be doing with my time."</P>
<P>"Is this a mutiny?"</P>
<P>"Not yet." Nicole smiled an almost devilish smile. The boat was just rocking,
not sinking.</P>
<P>"I for one, am all in favor a anythin' that will get me closer ta the object
of mah heart's desire." Mary Cherry grinned, picturing her 'Lil' Lily', her
thick southern accent coming through in waves. </P>
<P>Nicole clenched her teeth. Mary Cherry had a knack for giving her migraines.
Part of her set aside a dislike for natural blondes. "If there's an arbitrator,
that could -"</P>
<P>"No." Brooke shook her head. "One on one. Sam doesn't trust you."</P><I>
<P>'And frankly, neither do I.'</P></I>
<P>"Smart girl. Perhaps I underestimate her."</P>
<P>"Everything will be fine, you'll see."</P>
<P>"Monday, we'll see. Till then, those of us living in the real world
anticipate a changed landscape. But please, prove me wrong."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P>Brooke and Sam came home at the same time, and entered the living room to
find their parents waiting for them. They looked at each other. This couldn't
turn out well.</P>
<P>"Hello, girls." Mike greeted them.</P>
<P>"How was your day?" Jane asked.</P>
<P>How was your day? Oh no. That could mean anything. That could mean a trap. A
slick, non-answer was in order.</P>
<P>"Oh, you know, it was...a day." Brooke sputtered.</P>
<P>"How eloquent." Sam whispered, let Brooke glare, and then focused on the
adults. "I thought you guys would be gone by now."</P>
<P>"We were..." Mike started.</P>
<P>"But we thought, since we're going to be a family, it would be nice if we
could all get away and bond." Jane said with a smile.</P>
<P>"Bond?" Brooke and Sam exclaimed simultaneously.</P>
<P>"We know you two aren't as close as you used to be," Brooke's father said,
"and we felt that a change of scenery would do you good."</P>
<P>Brooke and Sam looked at one another questioningly. </P><I>
<P>'Close? Us? Ha!' </I>The parents needed to do a background check.</P>
<P>"Where?" Sam asked, frowning.</P>
<P>"Nevada."</P>
<P>"Nevada?" Brooke repeated incredulously. She looked at her nemesis. "What
-"</P>
<P>"Could we possibly do in Nevada?" Sam finished.</P>
<P>"There's the Hoover Dam, the Grand Canyon..." Jane rattled off.</P>
<P>"Casinos we can't go into,"</P>
<P>"And miles and miles of hot desert where she can dump my body." Brooke
accused.</P>
<P>"Please. I'd be more careful than that. I'd hire someone to do it." The
brunette said smugly.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"And pay him off with what? Your wit?" Brooke snapped. "Wait. You could
prostitute yourself and he could be your pimp. I'm sure you'd make quite a
living; if you wore a bag over your head."</P>
<P>Sam scowled, and was about to come back, when she was interrupted.</P>
<P>"This isn't up for debate. Get in the car." Mike commanded.</P>
<P>"Dad!"</P>
<P>"Mom!"</P>
<P>The parents pointed, and as the girls walked away, Mike turned to his fiancé.
</P>
<P>"This was your idea."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P>"Can you turn down the air conditioning?" Brooke requested, after they were
on the road awhile.</P>
<P>She and Sam were forced into the backseat, and they were sitting with as much
space between them as possible. She envisioned the aspiring journalist tied to
the roof of the car. That would be sweet.</P>
<P>"The Ice Queen's cold? I'm shocked." Sam remarked.</P>
<P>"What's a matter? The witch can't stand the heat?" Her dad stared at her in
the rearview mirror. "Witch. *Witch*."</P>
<P>Sam smirked. "I have to say, that's my favorite rumor. Good thing you don't
have a dog. I might sacrifice it. Or eat it."</P>
<P>"You're so juvenile." Brooke was disgusted.</P>
<P>"Me? I don't have a friend who goes around hypnotizing people to get
amusement out of their humiliation."</P>
<P>"That wasn't my idea. And there was an apology."</P>
<P>"Shouldn't you have control over your flock?" Sam narrowed her eyes. "You'll
stoop to any level, won't you?"</P>
<P>"You're the one who waits to exploit any mistake I make. You wanna know why
you get associated with the black arts? Cause it's common knowledge that you'll
sell your soul for a story."</P>
<P>"At least I have a soul to sell."</P>
<P>"Out of bounds, Sam. You can't prove the metaphysical." She smiled.</P>
<P>"Actually, as a witch, I believe I can." She reached out to Brook tauntingly,
and the blonde recoiled. She grinned at this.</P>
<P>"Like I said, juvenile." Brooke regained her composure. "You know what your
real problem is?"</P>
<P>"No, but I bet you're going to tell me."</P>
<P>The air conditioning didn't go down, but the radio went up.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P>"I hate when our complaints go unheard." Sam commented. She was very
displeased.</P>
<P>The parents had gotten them their key when they arrived at the hotel, and
immediately went to the bar. It was horrible. It was some evil punishment. They
had to share a room. Share one room. There were two rooms, of course, but their
parents must have really wanted to take them home in body bags.</P>
<P>Brooke opened up the only other door in the room. "One bathroom."</P>
<P>Sam grimaced. "I call first shower."</P>
<P>"I call first shower in the mornings."</P>
<P>"Damn." </P>
<P>The cheerleader had the initial lead on this vacation. It helped her
mood.</P>
<P>"Well, see ya." She turned to leave.</P>
<P>"Hold it. There's still the matter of the truce."</P>
<P>"But -"</P>
<P>"Change of location doesn't mean anything."</P>
<P>Brooke turned around. "Use all the hot water and I get to come up with the
first rule." </P>
<P>"Well played." Sam admitted grudgingly. Down by two.</P>
<P>A few minutes later the shower was occupied, and before Brooke lied down on
the bed she was claiming, she grabbed the remote for the TV and switched it on.
The Spice Channel came on, and she suddenly knew all she needed to know about
the previous occupant of the room. What a way to start off what was sure to be a
*fabulous* weekend. Utterly repulsed, she clicked the channel button...after
several moments of struggling with her hormones and teenage curiosity. </P>
<P>After an overall letdown with her once boyfriend, Josh, it had opened her
eyes somewhat. Sex was something to be entered into carefully, but that didn't
mean she wasn't aware of how much this stage of her life was ruled by, what
Glass liked to call, "urges that lead to five seconds of bliss, and a lifetime
of crabs and other unmentionables".</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P>"Brooke!" Sam's muffled voice said from inside the bathroom, though she
didn't hear her. "Brooke!" Still no go. "BROOKE!"</P>
<P>That time she heard her. Grumbling to herself, Brooke got up off the bed,
went over to the door, turned the knob roughly, and pushed the door open.</P>
<P>"Ow!" Sam spat, as the door had hit her foot.</P>
<P>"Wha...?" Brooke began to demand, but lost her voice as she realized Sam was
naked. Very naked. So naked that...there were curves...and dripping... "What are
you doing?"</P>
<P>"Trying to ignore this new injury I've just suffered."</P>
<P>"Huh?" She had to clear her head. "Clothes. You have no clothes on."</P>
<P>"I didn't realize showering without clothes was abnormal."</P>
<P>"Well it is. I mean, no it isn't, but...what did you want?" Had to take her
eyes away. "And how come you're not uncomfortable? I'm seeing you in your most
vulnerable state." </P>
<P>There. That sounded like something she would say. Sam was flawless. Why'd she
have to be flawless?</P>
<P>"Should I be ashamed?"</P>
<P>"No..." </P><I>
<P>'No, you really shouldn't.'</P></I>
<P>"Besides, this kind of thing isn't ammunition. First rule, anything that
happens outside of the gulag that we wrongly call a school, is off limits.
Agreed?"</P>
<P>She blinked. "Yeah, sure...whatever."</P>
<P>"Now the reason I called you was cause I needed clothes to get dressed with.
But seeing as you didn't hear me, I had planned on poking my head out, but you
barged in here like some deranged serial killer. Guess I'll just get some
myself."</P>
<P>"Put a towel on."</P>
<P>"Why Brooke McQueen, are you -?"</P>
<P>"Shut up, *Samantha*." Brooke was thinking that maybe she should have let Sam
use all the hot water.</P>
<P>Oh yeah. It was all evened up.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P>"One article about us a month." Brooke said, once they were both focused, and
not to mention fully covered.</P>
<P>Sam laughed out of disbelief, sitting Indian-style on her bed. "A month?
Won't do it. If I let things slide, there's a substantially higher risk of
getting stepped on. I'm not about to lose that edge. It's a check and balance
system."</P>
<P>"Very democratic. Is that how you justify what you write? You know you go
overboard sometimes."</P>
<P>"What's your point? I just want to see the kids who don't have a voice, stay
afloat. We've both crossed boundaries, but I only report the truth, unlike
others."</P>
<P>"Like the time you blabbed about how some of the squad cheated?"</P>
<P>"It was true, wasn't it?"</P>
<P>"We all have to go through the same thing, Sam, and you fed them to the
lions. They weren't all out to get you; you just did it to get to me."</P>
<P>"I don't see how they deserve to be cut slack cause their cheerleaders."</P>
<P>Brooke paced. "It's always about lines with you! Guess what? While we're
waging our civil wars, there's a bigger enemy. The teachers and their Nazi-like
tactics. Some of us may be cheerleaders, but we're *all* teenagers. Unite or
die. Don't you think our battles should be put on hold whenever the bigger ones
come up?"</P>
<P>Sam thought about it. Brooke was right. Damn her. But she wasn't done
fighting.</P>
<P>"I need insurance."</P>
<P>"Nicole makes any unsponsored move, and she'll be automatically blacklisted,
amount of time dependent upon the offense. As a bonus, the whole school will
anonymously become aware of her dyeing routine." She saw Sam writing. "This is
off the record, right?"</P>
<P>"Just recording the rules." Sam grinned. "Oh, expand that beyond the
She-Bitch. Just in case."</P>
<P>Brooke nodded. "Do we have a deal on this or what?"</P>
<P>"Yeah. We have a deal. Next topic..."</P>
<P>The sound of someone knocking caused them both to look at the door and wonder
who was intruding.</P>
<P>"Haven't you left that room yet?" Jane asked from the other side. "Come on,
we're going out to eat and then we have tickets to Sigfried and Roy."</P>
<P>"Magic is deceiving and makes you feel like you have very little
intelligence." Sam complained.</P>
<P>"Can't you let go of your quest to end every single social injustice for a
few hours and try to be an actual fifteen-year-old?" Brooke questioned with a
sigh.</P>
<P>Sam eyebrows went up. "You like magic?"</P>
<P>"Not necessarily, but I do like things that remind me not to take my life too
seriously, which I often do. I can admit it. You think I went to that soup
kitchen last year to make sure my throne stayed secure in the eyes of the masses
or something, but I went for me." Sam was speechless. "Don't know me as well as
you think you do."</P>
<P>"Some information...is bound to...slip through the cracks." The brunette
responded lamely. "And there you go again, trying to pass yourself off as better
than me."</P>
<P>Sam drove her crazy. "I'm not trying to..." A thought had just entered her
mind. "What are you going to wear?"</P><I>
<P>'Okay, that came out of left field.'</I> Sam reasoned that it was a strange
new way of avoiding confrontation.</P>
<P>"Uh, what I have on."</P>
<P>"Oh." Brooke was disappointed.</P>
<P>"Why do you care?"</P>
<P>"I don't."</P>
<P>"Then why -?"</P><I>
<P>'Get yourself out of this.'</I> Brooke thought to herself.</P>
<P>"I just thought that maybe I could help you not look like a hooker for once.
But if you really are striving to become, what's the PC term? A lady of the
evening, then I'll just step aside." Sam glowered on cue. "You brought that on
yourself."</P>
<P>"Little tip. Don't bother trying to fill out," She gestured to the blonde's
chest, "for Sigfried and Roy. I hear they're spoken for, if you catch my drift."
Sam grinned. "You'd have better luck getting a rise out of one of the
tigers."</P>
<P>Brooke gaped. "That was -"</P>
<P>"Not my subtlest, I know. Got the reaction I was hoping for, though, so in
the end, it accomplished its mission."</P>
<P>"Spend a lot of time seeing how I'm filling out, do you?" Both were surprised
at the question, and their arsenals quickly vanished. "Should we go?"</P>
<P>"Lets."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P>One tense dinner and about ten flashy illusions later, Sam and Brooke were
back in their room, lying on their beds in the dark. They were even more
ignorant of each other's existence than usual, and that was hard to do. They
weren't good at hiding the new level of uncomfortableness, so the adults picked
up on it, though no comments were made. Acting normal was difficult when your
brain cells couldn't all decide -</P><I>
<P>'What the hell is going on?'</I> The girls both thought.</P>
<P>Sam was wondering why she wanted to blush when Brooke asked her if she kept
tabs on her development. She should've had a retort ready, because she had never
ogled the girl. The evil, smooth-skinned, not hard on the eyes, underhanded,
sharp-tongued girl that had made her life painfully unbearable even if she went
days without speaking to her. No, she hadn't ogled her.</P>
<P>Had she? Where were these thoughts coming from? She wished she were back
home. It was predictable there. She wasn't reminded of certain...things. It was
all wrong.</P>
<P>And Brooke, Brooke had one vivid image to deal with. She had never denied
that Sam was attractive, but the bathroom was sensory overload. If she were
completely honest with herself, she'd realize that she never had a problem with
Sam. Most of her side of the arguments stemmed from her belief that given their
differing cliques, it was necessary and expected of her to bicker. There was one
problem she had, but that wasn't Sam's fault.</P>
<P>What scared her the most, and what hurt, was that she had a feeling Sam meant
what she said most of the time. Being away from home was affecting her. It was
funny how not even half a day could strip away the Brooke McQueen persona that
existed there, and how she was becoming the real Brooke McQueen; she had
difficulty finding her these days. She couldn't shed it all though, because she
felt as if she still had to keep up with Sam. </P>
<P>At some times, it was exhilarating. Nothing got her going like when Sam was
around. Other times, it was exhausting. But it had become routine. Routine was
easy.</P>
<P>Not nakedness.</P>
<P>Confusion aside, they knew subconsciously that the bathroom scene had been
planned on both their parts. Sleep. Sleep was the only escape available.</P>
<P>"Sam?"</P>
<P>"Yeah, Brooke?"</P>
<P>"I hate you."</P>
<P>"Hate you too."</P>
<P>That was better.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P>Sam had emerged from the wondrous land of dreams before Brooke, and was
taking the opportunity to re-establish the seething hatred she felt for her. But
it wasn't going well. Hoping that early morning Brooke (before the application
of makeup and the fixing of hair) was a hideous monstrosity, she was sorely
disappointed. Was that the word she was searching for? Disappointed? She didn't
understand why Brooke had gone to any lengths necessary to hide herself, because
the truth was, the all-natural version was just as beautiful as the chemically
enhanced version.</P>
<P></P>
<P>No. She absolutely could not think these things. And she couldn't gaze
either. Gazing? When did she start gazing? She wasn't gazing. Brooke was waking
up. It was time to look pissed off. Sam could look pissed off; no one else was
better at it than she was.</P>
<P>"Your shower awaits, your Majesty." Sam said sarcastically, as she tried not
to concentrate on the fact that Brooke was rubbing her eyes. How could such a
mundane act hold her attention?</P>
<P>Brooke smiled. "Your hair's all..."</P>
<P>Sam tried frantically to smooth it out. "We can't all wake up perfect, you
know."</P>
<P>Brooke found it cute really, but again she had to match...</P><I>
<P>'Did she just say I was perfect?'</P>
<P>'Did I just say she was...that came out wrong. Don't you mean *right*? Shut
up, brain.'</P></I>
<P>The cheerleader went in the bathroom, choosing to leave it alone. Getting in
the shower, she prayed it would just fizzle out. Everything. It was a brand new
day. Things would be back to normal. Then it occurred to her what she'd
done.</P>
<P>"I didn't shut the door all the way." Brooke realized quietly.</P>
<P>About that time, Sam realized it too, and decided that given the
circumstances, the best thing to do was run away. Which she promptly did.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P>"Maybe this was a bad idea." Jane said to her soon to be husband, and then
glanced skyward.</P>
<P>Several thousand feet up, their respective daughters were sitting in a
helicopter, getting a tour, and they prayed they'd both come back down. In that
helicopter, those two teenagers were viewing a marvel of the natural world.
Breathtaking, spectacular...and very, very large. That was how Sam and Brooke
chose to describe the Grand Canyon. They were thankful it was so engrossing;
they didn't have to concentrate on their close proximity to one another that
way.</P>
<P>It was cramped in the chopper. Extremely cramped. They had been showing
tremendous, commendable restraint. Mostly because they were at peace, looking
down at such a giant crack in the earth. It really was quite a sight. It was as
if nothing else mattered. They were insignificant in comparison. The way the sun
hit the rocks, the whole atmosphere was incredibly picturesque.</P>
<P>And the experience would have been perfect if it weren't for the noise of the
engine and propeller, plus the pilot's voice interrupting the serenity at
regular intervals.</P>
<P>"That over there? That's Eagle Rock." He informed them.</P>
<P>Brooke saw it, but failed to see why it was given that name.</P>
<P>"It looks like an eagle." Sam snickered, amused at the clueless expression on
Brooke's face. "See the wingspan?" She had to reach over Brooke's shoulder to
point it out, and then her hand rested there.</P>
<P>Breathing stopped.</P>
<P>"Uh...huh." Sam hadn't removed her hand, and she didn't seem to mind. "If you
wanna push me out, you have to get him to open the door first."</P>
<P>The brunette hadn't been paying attention; she had been smelling Brooke's
shampoo.</P>
<P>"Push you out? Tempting." She pretended to contemplate. "Imagine the echo if
you screamed on the way down."</P>
<P>"You're sick."</P>
<P>"And you're the one who started this. How do I know you don't intend to watch
me plummet to my death? A cheerleader and a homicidal maniac. Wow. That'll go
great on a college application."</P>
<P>That didn't have her usual biting flair, and Brooke noticed.</P>
<P>"Look, just...forget it, okay?" She sighed, and turned to the pilot. This was
becoming too strange. Something was changing, or had changed. She needed
separation. "Can we land?"</P>
<P>"Be on the ground in a few." The pilot answered.</P>
<P>"Can you please move?" She asked Sam.</P>
<P>Sam took her hand away, not even aware that it had been there.</P>
<P>"Sorry."</P>
<P>Brooke looked at the girl, who was averting her eyes. "No problem."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P>The hotel pool was practically empty. One person was in the water, having
just jumped off the diving board and making a loud splash. Brooke's whole world
was being flipped upside down, and she didn't like it. Starting with her
sexuality that was up in the air. But that wasn't much of an issue for her, at
least personally, as she had no objection to that lifestyle. As far as the
school, that was a different story altogether. </P>
<P>She refused to acknowledge why she was questioning her sexuality, and nobody
could drag it out of her.</P>
<P>She couldn't deal with it, wouldn't deal with it, and she couldn't deal with
it. Because it was absurd. There were certain universal truths that she lived
by, and universal truths were supposed to stay constant, unchangeable. She
should've been able to rely on them, just like all the other times her life had
been hectic, but now one of those truths was causing the craziness. She was
fighting it on principle, and because it was downright weird.</P>
<P>Turning onto her back, she closed her eyes and let herself float.</P>
<P>Could she be denying herself something good? Definite possibility. Could it
lead to a public shaming? Greater possibility. Yet those questions meant
nothing, given the past attitude of a particular someone she'd refrain from
naming. She figured she'd end up crushed. Then again, she felt she played it
safe too much; that wasn't fulfilling at all. And she could've sworn...no, it
had to be her imagination.</P>
<P>She simply had a hard time accepting things that didn't make sense. However,
maybe it wasn't supposed to make sense. Maybe it was supposed to feel like she
was spinning out of control, and that was the entire point. If she gave in, it
would destroy a foundation that had taken awhile to build. And a tradition.
There would be a new level she'd have to get used to and adapt to. Obviously,
that course of action depended upon if she could be positive about the reactions
from the people in her life.</P>
<P>Though there was one reaction that was the most important of all. </P>
<P align=center></P>
<P>"Thought you might've drowned." Sam said. </P>
<P>She had been sitting with her legs hanging over the side of the pool for the
past few minutes, but she wasn't dressed for swimming. An outsider would've
sworn that she was gazing, but she wasn't. Nor was she having the same thoughts
as her enemy. </P>
<P>Her *enemy*.</P>
<P>"Why? Did you wanna do it yourself?" Brooke snapped, getting vertical and
wading over.</P>
<P>"Was that a request?"</P>
<P>Ooh. This was what they knew how to do. And it was in rare form.</P>
<P>"Have you been sitting there plotting how you're going to accomplish it?"
Brooke got bold.</P>
<P>"Why do you assume my whole reason for being anywhere always has to do with
you?" Sam scowled.</P>
<P>"Why shouldn't I make that assumption?"</P>
<P>And it builds.</P>
<P>"Never assume. That's the kind of thing that can get you into trouble. Shame
on you, Brooke."</P>
<P>And it builds.</P>
<P>"Why do you insist on harassing me?"</P>
<P>And it builds. Sam's eyes were so focused and full of fire. If she weren't
enraged beyond belief, Brooke would've been turned on.</P>
<P>"Why do you make it so easy?"</P>
<P>There's the peak. And Brooke's hair was wet, Sam remembered. That was a new
look. A good look.</P>
<P>"Why the hell do we keep doing this?" Brooke demanded.</P>
<P>Freeze. They began rolling down the mountain. Sam got her feet out of the
water quickly, and stood on them.</P>
<P>"I came here to start formalizing the truce contract, but I guess that'll
have to wait. Don't stay in there too long, your skin will shrivel. That ruins
the yearbook picture."</P>
<P>"Don't walk away, Sam."</P>
<P>"It's a free country, and I have my reasons. Just like your mother did."</P>
<P>All rationality left Brooke's head. "At least she didn't hate me so much that
she felt the need to die to get away from me. Good thing neither of us has to
live with something like that. Oh wait. I forgot." She glared at Sam.</P>
<P>Sam ran off, after the shock wore off, and then Brooke's words finally
registered to her brain.</P>
<P>"Shit."</P>
<P>She wished someone would drown her.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P>The door was locked, and Sam figured Brooke deserved that. She deserved a lot
of things right now. The handle had been turned a few times, and then she heard
Brooke slump against the door out in the hallway. Words would've done no good;
that was for sure. As hurt as she was, as many memories and thoughts of guilt
that had surfaced, she couldn't cry. She had worked long and hard to become numb
whenever her father was mentioned.</P>
<P>That was how she could be fine with her mother dating, and now, getting
remarried. She could put up the front of not being affected, and it had made
everything easier for everyone. Emotion was something she had never learned how
to handle. Sadness, love, and even happiness. A heartless high school
journalist. Every journalist became heartless, it was a job requirement; she was
just getting a head start. All were pushed away at a certain point, including
her closest friends.</P>
<P>And how could she possibly...when she acted like...? It was a temporary lapse
on her part, but she had set herself straight. She was reinvested in her intense
and utter hatred of Brooke McQueen. There were no conflicts anymore. It was all
back to normal. Several hours passed as she tried to convince herself of that,
sitting against the headboard of her bed, and staring at the wall. Eventually,
the door opened.</P>
<P>Her opposition entered the room, letting light in, but the door was soon
shut, leaving darkness yet again. Brooke stood there, humble and ashamed. But
Sam couldn't look.</P>
<P>"I told your mom I locked myself out. They had a spare set."</P>
<P>"Cold?" Her voice was monotone.</P>
<P>"A little. But considering I was sitting in a damp bikini, in an
air-conditioned hallway -"</P>
<P>"You sat there this whole time?" An inflection of surprise was expected, but
it wasn't there.</P>
<P>"Yeah. Self-punishment." Brooke cleared her throat. "I'm glad."</P>
<P>"Glad?"</P>
<P>"That you didn't like...slit your wrists or anything."</P>
<P>"Lacked the motivation."</P>
<P>"And..." She paused. "I'm sorry."</P>
<P>"For?"</P>
<P>"You really want me to say?"</P>
<P>"No."</P>
<P>"I swear to God I didn't mean it, Sam. I'm sure that he...you were his
daughter. He loved you." Her voice was thick with emotion. <I>'How could he
not?'</P></I>
<P>Emotion. Hmm. </P>
<P>"Um...I've been doing a lot of reflection. You're probably gonna think this
is part of some big setup or conspiracy, and given our history I can't really
blame you, but when we try and tear each other apart, I don't mean what I say.
Honest." Sam hadn't moved. "You want an explanation."</P>
<P>She closed her eyes, and took a breath. </P>
<P>"I got to where I am somehow, and now I'm scared I won't be complete if I'm
not at the top. In the grand scheme, this popularity doesn't mean anything, I
know, but I'm trapped in it. You're comfortable just being who you are, and
instead of saying 'good for you', I try to drag you down. I'm sorry for that
too." She laughed out of relief. "But I can't do it anymore. The constant
character attacks...it's stressful for both of us, and...I'm tired." </P>
<P>Sam finally looked, and was trying to figure out who it was that had just
said all that. The recognition set in, and if her head were capable of spinning,
it would have.</P>
<P>She smirked. Finally, an expression. "Comfortable? I'd love what you
have."</P>
<P>It was Brooke's turn to wonder who she was looking at. "You don't want it. It
sucks. It's all false. I hate that I can't be who I really am."</P>
<P>"Who are you now?" Brooke shrugged. If Sam didn't know who she was, then who
really did? "I know you didn't mean it." Sam said softly. "And you're not the
only one who's sorry. For everything." </P>
<P></P>
<P>Brooke walked over to Sam's bed, and sat down. "Is this off the record?"</P>
<P>The brunette's floodgates opened at that question, and she cried. And kept
crying. There were years to release. After watching for a few moments, stunned,
Brooke reached her hands out. Sam leaned into her, knowing only that she needed
some support. Sooner or later she dried up, and began wiping her eyes.</P>
<P>"Screw the record." </P>
<P>The blonde smiled. "Want first shower in the morning?"</P>
<P>Sam had been kidding herself. Nothing was ever going to be the same
again.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P>"We're leaving in an hour." Mike called, knocking on the door.</P>
<P>Brooke had laid with Sam until she had fallen asleep, then showered, and then
slept in her own bed. Clearing away the haze, she looked at the alarm clock
sitting on the night table between the beds. Noon? Well, they had been pretty
tired. Wasn't much of surprise really, the past evening had knocked the walls
down and drained a lot out of them. Including the desire to waste energy trading
damaging barbs with each other. That same peacefulness they felt over the Grand
Canyon happened again as they had drifted off.</P>
<P>Nothing was settled exactly, and the bigger issue would still have to be
addressed. One step at a time. They didn't hate each other, but there had been a
complex twisting of thoughts which caused them to project their insecurities on
one another, and turn it all into big productions of verbal sparring. Teenagers
were smarter than people gave them credit for. Psychology was a piece of cake.
Anyhow, that admittance was enough for one weekend. </P>
<P>And Brooke was no more sure of "that," then she been yesterday. Though she
was sort of living in a state of denial as far as "that" was concerned. That
particular someone, whom she guessed she could now call Sam, if Sam did...there
would be the social order to contend with. She couldn't change the system; she'd
be tossed aside if she even made an attempt. Popularity would vanish, but as
long as she held some clout, it would come in handy until she graduated.
Depending on how "that" was handled, if it was going to be, the fallout could be
minimized for both of them. </P>
<P>Sam would go along with it, she thought, because Brooke knew she liked her
position despite her aspiration to be shallow. Press was a powerful thing, and
she wouldn't jeopardize what she had going.</P>
<P>"Morning." Sam muttered sleepily, as she joined the waking world.</P>
<P>"The word you're searching for would be 'afternoon'." Brooke smiled. "I'd
hurry."</P>
<P>"Yeah...uh..." She walked on shaky legs over to the bathroom door, and turned
to look at Brooke, opening and closing her mouth several times before deciding
on - "Yeah."</P>
<P>"Welcome."</P>
<P>"Am I the only one who feels like we progressed -?"</P>
<P>"Quickly?"</P>
<P>"I was thinking light speed. Hasn't even been a full two days. It's a change
of monumental proportions."</P>
<P>"Going from foes to..." She trailed off, not quite sure how to finish.
"Definitely fast." Brooke agreed. "Wanna slow down?"</P>
<P>"We're not finished?" Sam questioned.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Yeah...yeah. I mean, what more is there to do? We're friends now, so..."</P>
<P>"Are we?" Had a pin just dropped? Sam disliked quiet. Especially quiet she
herself caused. "I can see the faces now. The structure collapsing." </P>
<P>"You love shaking things up, don't you?"</P>
<P>She grinned. "McPherson and McQueen have a truce? The world's ending!"</P>
<P>Brooke chuckled. "About that...how do you feel about calling it a 'mutual
surrender' instead?"</P>
<P>Sam thought. "Hang on, something I have to do." She grabbed her notebook,
which was sitting underneath her pillow, and began tearing out the pages as she
walked into the bathroom. She shredded the paper, and flushed it all. "Mutual
surrender? I like it."</P>
<P>"You're gonna get clean...so I'm gonna change...and then, you know...go wait
with the parental units."</P>
<P>Closing the bathroom door, Sam smiled her first genuine smile since...awhile
ago. One step at a time.</P>
<P>One step at a time. </P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P>"Is it me, or were they awfully calm during the ride this time around?" Mike
asked Jane as they collapsed onto the couch in the living room.</P>
<P>"Like you said, it was my idea." She smiled, pleased with her decision.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P>"Dish already!" Carmen demanded. She and Lily were practically in Sam's face.
"Not one confrontation, and the day's almost over. Everyone's picked up on the
oddness. Did you drug her? Did she drug you? Sedatives?"</P>
<P>"Is it pot?" Lily asked. "Cause that's natural. It comes from the ground, and
that's a step in the right direction. I'm proud of you."</P>
<P></P>
<P>Carmen's eyes widened. "Proud?"</P>
<P>"It's a plant!"</P>
<P>Sam shook her head. "No chemical depressants or relaxants, and that's all
you're gonna get. Please save all your questions for the imaginary press
conference that's never going to take place."</P>
<P>Carmen and Lily looked at each other, and nodded. Oh yeah. Drugs. No
question.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P>"Enough is enough. I've given you ample time to divulge the details of your
excursion freely, and since you haven't, I suppose I have to drag what I want to
know out of you." Nicole said irritably, as she checked her appearance in one of
bathroom's mirrors.</P>
<P>Brooke had no response.</P>
<P>"Let me get this straight. You're deciding to deny me information that will
affect my life and the way things are run around here?"</P>
<P>"If that's the way you choose to phrase it." Brooke spoke.</P>
<P>"Where do you get off?"</P>
<P>"Are we friends, Nic? Cause if we are, then you'll back off." Nicole's mouth
hung open. "That's not the most attractive look in the world." She waited a
second for the pursing of the lips, then went on. "We all have personal stuff;
you know some of mine, I know some of yours. But I'm keeping this weekend all to
myself."</P>
<P>"Bold, Brooke; very bold." Nicole respected the natural blonde for moments
like these. Something did happen. Obviously. "Don't tell me you have an
alliance."</P>
<P>"I thought I had gone over this mere seconds ago?"</P>
<P>"The rules are -"</P>
<P>She didn't want to say anything, but she knew she had to state her position
without revealing what she and Sam had shared. The earlier, the better.</P>
<P>"The rules are changing." Brooke informed her. "Fine, you'll hear only what I
feel you need to hear. We have a cease-fire. We've ended the hostilities, and if
I want, I'll open up the guest list to the general public. I've re-evaluated my
entire outlook. Not just with Sam, but with my policies as well. Things will
slowly evolve on their own, I'm sure, I just got it started."</P>
<P>"Do you have any idea *what* you started? Any idea at all?"</P>
<P>"Not really, and for the first time, I don't give a damn. Now, if you don't
like it, you're more than welcome to walk away, and do whatever you feel you
have to do. A part of me would love to take that leap. If I had to. But I hope
I'm right in believing you're a better person than that. That you're my friend
underneath all those masks you put on."</P>
<P>"And if I defect?" Nicole challenged.</P>
<P>"Then I'll make your days here very unpleasant. I won't sacrifice my
happiness for you, and I won't be walked on. People want to see Nicole Julian go
down a hell of a lot more than Brooke McQueen, and we both know I could give
them quite a show."</P>
<P>"Or a story." Eyes narrowed.</P>
<P>"Don't make me do that. I like you, I do. Though there are times when you
make it really hard for me to recall why. You've watched my back, you've been
there for me, and I appreciate it. If I sound harsh, it's because I want there
to be total clarity between us, and I want you to see that I'm serious about
this."</P>
<P>The two blondes entered into a silent, almost deadly staring match. Nicole
was surprised, to say the least. No one ever interrupted her, or talked to her
the way Brooke had just done, and Brooke was the only one she'd ever let slide.
She was very impressed by the display, too. Confident, well stated...yes, there
was more to Brooke than just a pretty face.</P>
<P>The specifics of the weekend had been avoided, but Nicole could see by the
force of Brooke's voice and the words, that it had gone just as she had
predicted. The landscape had changed dramatically. With new policies and Spam
(and by association her small band of friends) no longer fair game, everything
needed to be remodeled. Could she go along with it? She wasn't sure yet, but the
answer wasn't "no." </P>
<P>She knew that eventually, Brooke and Spam were going to figure out something
she and a small minority had already figured out. That had been her biggest fear
going into the weekend, and now there was no stopping it without resorting to
extreme measures. But at the moment, she would adopt a "wait and see" attitude.
Making Brooke a casualty would be a risk, plus it was a moral dilemma, and she
wasn't all that certain she'd end up the winner. </P>
<P>"Which one of us is the bitch here?" She had to ask, her eyes softening.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Brooke smirked. "The student is surpassing the master."</P>
<P>"Surpassing? I wouldn't go that far."</P>
<P>"Can I count on you?"</P><I>
<P>'For now.'</P></I>
<P>"Be glad I'm fond of you." Nicole answered. "But for God sakes, Brookie, when
it happens, don't be obvious about it. Vomiting is something I like to do in
private. Oh Christ." She groaned. "I'll have to listen to Mary Cherry's
brilliant comments. You better pay for all the medication I'm gonna need."</P>
<P>"What are you talking about?"</P>
<P>Nicole was getting her turn now, and chose not to answer the question.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P align=center></P>
<P>Friday afternoon, Sam was doing laps around the school's track, which
happened to be along the football field. She mentally noted that a week had
passed since they had left for Nevada. A brief smile appeared on her face, and
then went away. Running in circles wasn't high on the list of things she enjoyed
doing. </P>
<P>But she wasn't given a choice. Brooke was right. They were forced to obey
adults who, it was clear, hailed Hitler. They used demoralizing, inhuman
punishment to keep students in line, and break them down bit by bit. Kids were
always watched and spied on, no one was safe.</P>
<P>Not even her, and she didn't do anything wrong. </P>
<P>It was a private conversation she had been having with Harrison before class
started. He liked to watch the girls' gym class whenever he had a free period,
and even though it could be considered voyeuristic, she forgave him. Hormones
were evil. She had taken advantage of any opportunities presented to her, to
watch a certain someone, so who was she to judge?</P>
<P>"All right, McPherson, hit the showers!" The gym teacher yelled to her.</P>
<P>Stopping, she bent over and put her hands on her knees, fighting back the
urge to yell, 'How hard?'</P>
<P>The sound of footsteps jogging over to her location made her look up.</P>
<P>"How you doing?" Brooke asked, trying hard not to laugh. </P>
<P>She had been one of a select few that had stayed to watch, that included Mary
Cherry, Harrison, Nicole, Lily and Carmen.</P>
<P>"The only thing still keeping me standing is my sheer desire not to make an
ass of myself. Thanks for asking." Sam replied sarcastically. She was close to
giving up. "But people probably paid good money to see that. I shouldn't
disappoint them."</P>
<P>"Gotta hold onto your dignity at all costs." Brooke grabbed her by the waist.
"Lean on me."</P>
<P>"Start singing and we'll have a problem." Sam warned. "How's this good for my
dignity? A rebel saved by a dainty, delicate cheerleader."</P>
<P>"I said, *at all costs*, didn't I?" Brooke grinned, as they began the trek
over. "And hey, I'm in top physical shape. Flips and splits don't come
naturally, you know. Hard work, determination -"</P>
<P>"If this is your recruiting pitch, you can forget it. I'd rather buy the
whole Richard Simmons videotape series before degrading myself."</P>
<P>"Degrading?" The blonde raised her eyebrows. "It's not too late for you to
take a fall. Just a reminder."</P>
<P>"Okay, okay." Sam paused. "It's not degrading. It keeps bodies fit and
promotes school spirit." She winced. "Ugh. I feel like such a conformist. So
dirty."</P>
<P>"Unclean! Unclean!" Brooke exclaimed while laughing, almost causing them both
to tumble.</P>
<P>"Are you happy now?"</P>
<P>"Do I look happy?" Sam didn't want to, but she smiled once she got a good
look at Brooke's face. They still bantered, but this new kind, this teasing and
playful banter; it was just fun. "You wouldn't be in this situation if you had
waited until you were out of her earshot."</P>
<P>Sam checked to make sure the teacher was off the field, but still whispered.
"The woman has hearing like a dog." An evil grin appeared. "Which makes sense,
considering she looks -"</P>
<P>"Haven't you gotten into enough trouble today?"</P>
<P>"So I remarked upon her abnormal amount of facial hair. I spoke the truth.
That's my constitutional right."</P>
<P>"And yet..."</P>
<P>"It came back to bite me." Sam finished. "Hope you don't think I learned my
lesson."</P>
<P>"I don't." </P>
<P>As they neared the bleachers, Brooke focused on the fact that a week had gone
by. Plenty of time. She couldn't take it anymore. And since they were kind of
talking about gym, it would be a decent segue-way. Teenagers had very little
patience; that was her excuse. She had to put it out there. </P>
<P>"Suggestion for the future? You won't get hit so often in dodge ball if you
stay focused on the game. Eyes and all."</P>
<P>Sam gulped. This was an interesting way to broach the subject. Though Brooke
could've been referring to something different than what she was thinking, and
she wanted it to be the same. Treading carefully was smart. </P>
<P>"I'll...make a note."</P><I>
<P>'Did I imagine that, or did I really see it? Stupid, stupid, stupid! See her
naked once, and your perceptive abilities go all screwy.'</P></I>
<P>There; the disappointment and confusion. They were on the same wavelength
after all.</P><I></I>
<P>"If you make one too." The brunette grinned. "Wouldn't want that face scarred
or anything."</P>
<P>Brooke blushed. "Then I'm not alone?" Sam pinched her arm. "Ow."</P>
<P>"If you felt that, you're not alone."</P>
<P>"You could've chosen a less hurtful demonstration."</P>
<P>"Sorry. Thought it was the most effective." She whispered once again. "Now,
if we were somewhere else..."</P>
<P>"I would've liked that better." Brooke lowered her voice. "I'm guessing we
both had this revelation around the same time?" Sam nodded. "Did it drive you
nuts, too?"</P>
<P>She nodded again. "It was hard enough wrapping my mind around the idea, but
then I had to settle with picturing you, while you got to see me nice and
close."</P>
<P>"It's burned into my brain."</P>
<P>"Does that mean I'm hot?"</P>
<P>"Speaking of vanity..." Brooke rolled her eyes. "You had your shot."</P>
<P>"I won't get one again?" The brunette frowned. </P>
<P>The cat was out of the bag, and she wanted to go full tilt. A huge rush of
happiness coursed through her, and being accepting of her feelings finally, she
held onto it.</P>
<P>"I didn't say that, but let's try and control ourselves. Steps, Sam. Steps."
The cheerleader admonished.</P>
<P>"All right. What's the next step?"</P>
<P>"Me asking what your plans are tonight."</P>
<P>"Going out with you?" Sam asked cautiously.</P>

<P>"I have several objections to that."</P>
<P>"Do you?"</P>
<P>"Yes." Sam answered. "Many."</P>
<P>"Too bad I can't listen to them right now."</P>
<P>Brooke really couldn't. They had reached the people, and she helped Sam sit.
Nicole was the only one who picked up on the "head in the clouds" looks on the
former opponents' faces. It was true.</P>
<P>"It begins." Nicole muttered, glancing around.</P>

people in real, honest-to-goodness, social settings. For more than five minutes.
Was this God's way of making her pay for her sins? </P>
<P>No. They weren't. Gross. They were. The glazed over, lovey-dovey...</P>
<P>"Great. Just great." Mary Cherry opened her mouth to speak. "I wouldn't."</P>
<P>She needed to find a table so she could bang her head against it, and then
she needed to find a toilet to empty her stomach's&nbsp;contents into.</P>
