<!-- Human Layers \ Part Six -->

<p>Back at Sunnydale High, Cordelia had moved to the library table with Willow,
		and Giles and Xander were in the stacks. She was trying to read and discover how
		to save the human race, but her ability to concentrate wasn't working that well.
		What was up with Buffy? One day they were fine, the next, the slayer couldn't be
		around her for more than two seconds. She had tried to call her at least a dozen
		times.</p>
		<p>And Willow was giving her dirty looks when she thought she wasn't being
		looked at. Her doubts were coming true. Buffy had disappeared on her, and now
		she was stuck. Well, she could go back to the fold, go back to being Queen of
		the Ditzes, but she wouldn't be able to forget. She'd seen the other side, so it
		wouldn't be the same. On the surface she could hide; they had certainly bought
		her lie. She didn't even get to tell Buffy about it.</p>
		<p>Wait...</p>
		<p>"I'm such an idiot!" Cordelia exclaimed.</p>
		<p>It was all falling into place now. Buffy had heard, and that started the
		typical chain reaction. Buffy must have been...why didn't she see it sooner? The
		avoidance, the silence, the flirting with Angel...and the final stage of revenge
		was...</p>

		<p>Xander poked his out from behind a shelf. "Did you just say what I think
		you said? And I didn't get it on tape? Damn!"</p>
		<p>"Willow, where's Angel's apartment?" The cheerleader asked the
		redhead.</p>
		<p>"Why?" Willow wondered, hoping her tone sounded angry enough.</p>
		<p>"Cause if I thought someone I was close to being on the verge
		of...something with, had sex with somebody that wasn't me, I know what I'd
		do."</p>
		<p>"Ha! You admit it!" She paused. "I think."</p>

		<p>Cordelia sighed. "Just tell me."</p>
		<p>"No!" She had been holding it in. Time to let it out. "How
		could you do that to her? I mean, we all knew you were evil, but even I didn't
		think you could stoop this low!"</p>
		<p>"Willow -" Cordelia tried. She didn't have time for this.</p>
		<p>"I'm not finished! She can't confront you, but suddenly I'm feeling
		brave, so I guess I'll have to! I've got sixteen years worth of rage on reserve;
		I can last for a long time, trust me!" She liked this. "It's not like
		she found out from some random person, either! She heard it from you! Rumors are
		one thing, cause you can't prove them, but-but you...suck! And I hate your
		shoes!" Whoa. She had said 'suck.' "She was coming to tell you that
		she loves you, and you were going on and on about your sweaty escapades with an
		Indian desk clerk!"</p>

		<p>"She what?" Xander and Cordelia echoed.</p>
		<p>Her timing had obviously been really bad.</p>
		<p>"Yeah, and she was really excited."</p>
		<p>"It was a *Mexican bellhop*, first of all -" Cordelia said. How
		that stuff mutated was beyond her.</p>
		<p>"Like that's *so* much better!"</p>
		<p>"I love her too!" She yelled. Then her words registered. She did.
		Wow. "And there was no desk clerk, or a bellhop, or a room service guy.
		There wasn't anybody. Harmony grew a brain cell and got suspicious, so I made it
		up. It's all false. *False*. I have way higher standards than that. I was going
		to tell her, but I never got the chance, okay? Now tell me where the damn
		apartment is."</p>

		<p>Willow was stunned. "Dayton Street. Two blocks b-before the
		Bronze." Cordelia ran out the doors. "Darn, I feel like a big meanie.
		And I'm pretty sure my throat's all red now."</p>
		<p>"Willow, you might want to see if you can fetch some water." Giles
		said. "Xander appears to have fainted."</p>
		<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
		<p>"Do you have any, um, threes?" Buffy asked, looking at her cards as
		she and Angel sat on the floor of his apartment.</p>

		<p>"What're the rules again?"</p>
		<p>"This is sad." She shook her head. "You've been around
		two-hundred years, and you can't even play Go Fish."</p>
		<p>"I like Gin."</p>
		<p>"I don't really need to know your drinking habits, thanks." Too
		much information.</p>
		<p>"It's another type of card game." He grinned.</p>

		<p>"Oh." She hid her embarrassment well. "Think I should call the
		library and see if they got anything on Grouchy Smurf yet?"</p>
		<p>Just then, someone started pounding on the door, and before either of them
		could react, it flew open. A drenched Cordelia came charging in.</p>
		<p>"Get your vampy hands *off* my girlfriend!" The brunette demanded,
		not surveying the situation first. The slayer and the vampire were too confused
		to do anything. "Oh God, I'm too late!" She saw the cards in their
		hands. "That's...different. Most people smoke after sex."</p>
		<p>"There was no sex." Buffy finally spoke. "There was going to
		be, but we...came to our senses." She smiled slightly, amused at Cordelia's
		little spectacle. "We decided to play cards instead. Talk about two
		completely unrelated activities...did you say 'girlfriend'?"</p>

		<p>Angel had gotten up and grabbed the blanket off of his bed. He gave it to
		Cordelia to use.</p>
		<p>"Here, you're soaked. I...don't have any towels."</p>
		<p>She looked apologetic. "I ran. I kinda didn't think to take my
		car."</p>
		<p>He looked up the stairs and outside his door, listening. "I think the
		rain's letting up. I'm gonna go make sure they aren't still searching for
		us." He smiled at them.</p>
		<p>They watched him leave, and then things became awkward.</p>
		<p>"Haven't got a clue on the Judge." Cordelia said, putting the
		blanket around her shoulders.</p>

		<p>"Our only option is panicking? Well, there goes my reputation as a
		superhero." Buffy sighed. "He's connected and powered up now, Spike
		and Dru aren't dust, and they're working with him."</p>
		<p>"Triple whammy? Ouch."</p>
		<p>"Big ouch. Spike *is* wheelchair-bound, though." She paused.
		"Girlfriend?"</p>
		<p>"You didn't sleep with him?" Buffy shook her head, and watched as
		the other girl sighed in relief. "It isn't true, any of it. I said it just
		to get Harmony off my back. I didn't know you were listening."</p>

		<p>Cordelia wasn't lying. The slayer's eyes grew wide, and then she looked
		guilty. So she had almost endangered what they had by jumping to a false
		conclusion? She had a habit of doing that too much, and knew she really had to
		stop. It wasn't a good thing; it made her feel lower than scum.</p>
		<p>"You know what this means, don't you? It means I'm a jerk. Some of the
		things I thought, said..."</p>
		<p>"Okay, how about you keep that to yourself?" They walked closer to
		one another.</p>
		<p>Buffy brought two of her fingers together and moved them in a turning motion
		in front of her mouth, like someone would a key. "Locked away
		forever."</p>
		<p>"And can we forget this ever happened?" Cordelia cupped her cheek.</p>
		<p>She wasn't used to this 'romantic contact' stuff, but Buffy wasn't trying to
		run, so she must've been doing something right.</p>

		<p>"Yes." Buffy closed her eyes, nodding. "Yes, we can."</p>
		<p>"There is one thing I wanna remember. Willow...she said you loved
		me." She smiled. "Word of advice, though? Don't mess with her."</p>
		<p>"Oh, I know." The slayer smiled back, looking at her once more.
		"She told you that?"</p>
		<p>"Yep. And I told her that I loved you."</p>

		<p>"No kidding. Huh. Works out well."</p>
		<p>"Doesn't it?" She wrapped her arms around Buffy's neck, and as the
		blanket fell to the floor, she leaned in. "I think we've done enough
		talking. Unless you wanna get Willow to help us out with this next part."</p>
		<p>"Enjoy the gutter?" Buffy asked with a grin.</p>
		<p>She let Cordelia make the initial contact. After all, she had started the
		first one; it was the cheerleader's turn. This time was much better, however.
		Mutual participation was substantially more enjoyable. They stood there,
		savoring the moment for as long as possible before they had to come up for air.
		This kiss had taken too damn long to get to, and they weren't going to waste it.</p>
		<p>They did separate at some point, but that only allowed them to place light
		kisses on each other's lips. Buffy ran her hand down Cordelia's rain-matted
		hair. She was looking at the true Cordelia Chase now. Her makeup had washed away
		and smeared in the rain, her hair wasn't blow-dried or conditioned, and the hair
		spray had failed. This was the brunette at her plainest and simplest, and she
		was still beautiful.</p>
		<p>"I love you." The girls said together, causing them to giggle. They
		*didn't* giggle. Not particularly often, anyway.</p>

		<p>It wasn't that they had anything against Willow, but they felt that they
		needed to say it to one another to get the full effect out of the words. They
		hugged tightly.</p>
		<p>"Part of you may be a jerk, part of me may be a jerk -" Cordelia
		began.</p>
		<p>"May be?" Buffy asked with a cocky smirk. Cordelia sucked gently on
		her bottom lip, teasing it, to get her to shut up. She wasn't complaining.</p>
		<p>"But everybody has that part. We're human. We've got parts that are
		gonna screw up. It's unavoidable. That's why it's a good thing it's the whole
		person I'm interested in; the good, the bad, and the -"</p>
		<p>"Don't finish that sentence." She returned the favor.</p>
		<p>"Sexy." Cordelia said breathlessly, winking.</p>

		<p>"I think we're on the same wavelength there, but what about -?"</p>
		<p>"Let them say whatever the hell they want. I'm above them. Not to
		mention hotter than all of them combined."</p>
		<p>"Can't argue with that." Buffy smiled.</p>
		<p>They proceeded to make out some more, their tongues instantly becoming the
		best of friends.</p>
		<p>"You should go save the world. I doubt anybody else is gonna get off
		their ass and do it."</p>
		<p>"Yeah, I heard Batman's really let himself go." She smirked.
		"Could use some help figuring out the 'how.'"</p>

		<p>"Lucky for you I don't have plans."</p>
		<p>They grasped hands, heading out into the night. Buffy had faced the music,
		and was extremely glad she had. The tune was pretty incredible. Boy, could
		Cordelia kiss.</p>
		<p>(<i>Are you gonna listen to me more often now? </i>Her rational side asked,
		gloating.)</p>
		<p>"Not if you're gonna brag." Buffy said under her breath. Cordelia
		looked at her. "So uh, where's my present?" She asked.</p>
		<p>"I'm not enough?" Cordelia questioned with mock hurt.</p>

		<p>"Somebody's full of herself." She thought. "Well, look who I'm
		talking to."</p>
		<p>The brunette grinned evilly. "You better run, Buffy. As fast as you
		can."</p>
		<p>"Like you'd catch me." She took off.</p>
		<p>Cordelia was never far behind.</p>
		<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
		<p>Giles and Willow were discussing a plan to defeat the Judge with Xander, as
		Buffy and Cordelia came running through the doors of the library. A plan he had
		come up with all by himself. He thought it was brilliant, and by the looks he
		hoped he was receiving, they thought so, too. Who said being the victim of an
		evil British sorcerer's magick spell couldn't be useful?</p>

		<p>"Are you positive you'll be able to -?" Giles started, but was
		distracted by the returning cheerleader and the surprisingly joyful slayer.</p>
		<p>"I won. Pay up." Cordelia requested.</p>
		<p>"We didn't bet." Buffy told her now girlfriend.</p>
		<p>"Well, we should have."</p>
		<p>"That's what everybody always says after they win. You'll just have to
		live with..." She grinned, thinking of something. "No. You've
		definitely earned a reward. A victory is a victory, bet or no bet."</p>

		<p>Cordelia waited. "So? What is it?"</p>
		<p>"It's not money, but I think you'll like it." She was drawing
		nearer and nearer to her mouth.</p>
		<p>Xander felt faint again and Giles looked down at a book, but Willow just
		smiled. Cordelia pointed to the group, reminding the slayer that they weren't
		exactly alone.</p>
		<p>Buffy blushed. "Right. Fully-functional Judge. Spike on wheels. Healthy
		Druscilla. Mass annihilation of humanity. I'm on task, I'm focused; I'm ready to
		do the duty."</p>
		<p>"The Judge is whole? And Spike and Druscilla survived? You're
		certain?" Giles asked, glad that they were back on a topic he could
		contribute to.</p>
		<p>Buffy nodded. "Oh, I'm certain."</p>

		<p>"Then we have no choice but to go with Xander's plan."</p>
		<p>"Could you be any less confident in me?" Xander wondered, hearing
		the not so enthusiastic tone of his voice.</p>
		<p>"It's a sound course of action, and there's no foreseeable reason why it
		shouldn't work, however, the most crucial part is all very much dependent on
		your acting skills. And if I remember last year's talent show correctly..."</p>
		<p>"Thanks for opening up old wounds, Giles." Buffy said as she and
		Willow whimpered. "It was a dumb play, anyway." She paused, killing
		the memory. "There. It's gone. Now, seeing as before Xander's plan,
		whatever it is, we had nothing...um..." She was attempting to come up with
		something inspiring, but was falling short. "Isn't anything better than
		nothing?"</p>

		<p>"Have I mentioned how much I love all the support in this room?" He
		asked sarcastically.</p>
		<p>It didn't matter. Soon they'd be thanking him for saving their hides and
		feeding him grapes whenever he so desired. Hmmm...maybe not the grapes, but he
		could dream.</p>
		<p>"You know I believe in you, Xand." Buffy smiled.</p>
		<p>"Me too!" Willow chipped in. "I woulda said so sooner, but I
		was going for the 'silent support' approach."</p>
		<p>"Slow down. Xander has a plan? Xander?" Cordelia found it difficult
		to disguise her shock.</p>

		<p>"And guess what, Cor? You get to be a major player." He smiled
		cryptically.</p>
		<p>Buffy hugged the brunette around the waist. "Congratulations."</p>
		<p>The cheerleader smiled. "Care to let me in on the plan I'm a part
		of?"</p>
		<p>"No." Xander answered.</p>
		<p>"Why not?" She demanded.</p>

		<p>"Because if I tell you, then you won't do it."</p>
		<p>All three girls raised their eyebrows.</p>
		<p>"When do you think they'll attack?" Willow asked Buffy, as Xander
		wasn't going to divulge.</p>
		<p>"Tomorrow night. That'll give the Judge time to recharge. Here's hoping
		we catch them at the factory, though."</p>
		<p>"I can still get into the base tonight." Xander offered.</p>
		<p>"The base?" Buffy asked. She had missed something.</p>

		<p>"It'd probably be wiser...strategy to wait until tomorrow, Xander."
		Giles told him. "The less time we illegally possess property owned by the
		military, the more comfortable I'll feel."</p>
		<p>"Worried about your green card?" Xander grinned.</p>
		<p>"The Council doesn't like to get entangled in governmental affairs,
		especially the affairs of this country, and I'm not high priority enough for
		them to deviate from that attitude."</p>
		<p>"Mother-Child complex, huh?" Cordelia asked rhetorically.</p>
		<p>"Aw! Giles! You'd take the rap for us?" Willow beamed, smiling at
		him.</p>

		<p>They all smiled at him, in fact.</p>
		<p>The watcher took off his glasses and rubbed them on his jacket. "It's
		simply my belief that the world would be far better off, if you all were...not
		incarcerated."</p>
		<p>"You love us."</p>
		<p>"Relax, don't get your knickers in a twist." Giles chose to ignore
		that. "I have patience, you know. Tomorrow it is. But all that tempting
		firepower..." Xander said.</p>
		<p>They thought he was going to drool.</p>
		<p>"Since I'm apparently gonna be an accomplice and most likely end up on
		the FBI's Most Wanted list, details would be nice." Cordelia said.

		"Like now."</p>
		<p>"We'll meet up with Oz and Willow at her house, then a weapon-hunting we
		will go." He looked the brunette over. "You'll have to wear something
		trashy...er. And not so wet. Unless it's a see-through..."</p>
		<p>"Hey!" Cordelia and Buffy exclaimed.</p>
		<p>He had blocked out his knowledge of their new relationship as best he could,
		but it all came back. He wasn't sure what his stance was yet, but the images he
		was picturing weren't bad. Weren't bad at all.</p>
		<p>"The mind wanders to crazy places. I try to control it, but -"</p>
		<p>"I'll call Oz later and ask him if we can use his van." The redhead
		said, glaring at her friend.</p>

		<p>"I'm thinking it'd be better if I don't know this stuff, and just stick
		to killing the bad things. Besides, if I get questioned by association, I can
		deny everything." Buffy commented.</p>
		<p>"How convenient for you." Xander said, eyeing her suspiciously.</p>
		<p>"Back off, monkey boy." Cordelia warned him. She turned to Buffy.
		"I need a shower. I'm starting to invent a new odor, and I'm gonna collapse
		in about two minutes."</p>
		<p>The slayer pouted. "K." She kissed her then, despite the audience.

		"But call when you get home. So I know you're safe."</p>
		<p>"This is that relationship thing where you become freakishly
		over-protective, isn't it?"</p>
		<p>"Hell yes." They kissed again. This was one aspect they were going
		to get a whole lot of enjoyment out of. "Talk to you later?"</p>
		<p>"Count on it." The cheerleader smiled.</p>
		<p>In a happy daze, Buffy watched Cordelia exit the library.</p>
		<p>"Things worked out?" Willow asked with a smile.</p>

		<p>"*Oh yeah*." She turned back around, and saw Xander's jaw hanging
		open. She went over to shut it. "If you didn't know before, you do now, and
		no matter how you feel about it, you have to promise me one thing."</p>
		<p>"What?" He asked, gulping.</p>
		<p>"Don't let anything happen to her."</p>
		<p>"I won't, Buff."</p>
		<p>He could see how serious she was just by looking into her eyes.</p>
		<p>"Promise me."</p>

		<p>They were dead serious.</p>
		<p>"I promise."</p>
		<p>And he meant it. He didn't want to be on the receiving end of a slayer ass
		whooping, no way.</p>
		<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
		<p>"Okay, what was that? And who are you?" Cordelia asked Xander the
		following night.</p>
		<p>He had just talked their way past a guard and into weapons storage. She had
		to be a brainless sex object, but it had gone smooth enough.</p>
		<p>Searching for what they had come for, he answered her questions.
		"Remember Halloween I got turned into a soldier?"</p>

		<p>"Yeah." She didn't want to reflect on that night of horrors, but he
		had taken charge and helped them all to live through it</p>
		<p>"Well, I still remember all of it. I know procedure, ordnance, access
		codes...everything. I know the whole layout for this base, and I'm pretty sure I
		can put together an M-16 in fifty-seven seconds."</p>
		<p>She was momentarily stunned. "Well, I'm sort of impressed. But let's
		just find the thing and get out of here."</p>
		<p>"Okay." He was onboard with that. "Uh...you and Buffy...what's
		the deal there?"</p>
		<p>"Are you being dense?" Cordelia asked. Not even he could be that
		blind.</p>

		<p>"Allow me to rephrase. Why you and Buffy? Is it for real, or...?"</p>
		<p>"Yeah, Xander. It's for real." She sighed. "Probably the first
		real thing I've ever had."</p>
		<p>He stopped, turning to see the sincerity on her face. "You have no
		problem with -?"</p>
		<p>"Dating a girl? Giving up the throne? Breaking every social rule that's
		been in place since the beginning of time?" She paused. "Surprisingly,
		I'm problem-free. I've always set the new trends, maybe this'll catch on."</p>
		<p>"What? Gay fever?" Xander asked, worriedly.</p>

		<p>Alternative couples didn't bother him really, but he enjoyed being
		heterosexual. His blockage with Buffy and Cordelia had more to do with the fact
		that, instead of choosing to go for him, they decided to swear off men forever.
		Unless they didn't last, but he'd never wish that on Buffy. If Cordelia was who
		she wanted, and she was happy, then that was that.</p>
		<p>And the cheerleader was much better for her than Angel.</p>
		<p>"No, dork." She hit him. "Dissolving the groups. The Jocks,
		the Goths, the Band People, the Computer Nerds, the Audio-Visual Nerds, the
		Yearbook Nerds..." There were a bunch of sub-categories. "You get the
		picture; a school where people can hang with whoever they want to. Without fear
		of, you know, persecution or whatever."</p>
		<p>"And after-school thrashings. Don't leave those out."</p>
		<p>"Cars, cash, class...wouldn't be a factor. Sunnydale could be a
		pioneer."</p>
		<p>"You're dreaming. It didn't work for Marx, it's not gonna work for you.
		Especially not on a Hellmouth."</p>

		<p>"I said *maybe*." She reminded him, nearly growling. Puncture her
		vision? How dare he. "Did you find it yet?"</p>
		<p>"Almost." There was quiet for a few moments. "You love her,
		huh?"</p>
		<p>"I really do." The brunette smiled. "She doesn't give me a
		whole lotta choice."</p>
		<p>She was still Cordelia, but part of her had transformed; he could certainly
		see that.</p>

		<p>"Does this mean the war's over?"</p>
		<p>"That's your call. I'll be around more often, but just cause I'm
		involved with someone that happens to be your friend, that doesn't change
		anything with us."</p>
		<p>"What if she changes it?" Xander grinned.</p>
		<p>"Then we'll have a discussion, and I'll...cave." She said, knowing
		that was going to be the result. "But in the meantime, I'm sure you'll
		still act like a total retard and leave me with plenty of opportunities to
		insult you. Though if you're willing to admit defeat..."</p>
		<p>"Never!" The very idea that he would do such a thing was
		ridiculous.</p>

		<p>"So it's on?"</p>
		<p>He had a gleam in his eye. "Oh, it's on."</p>
		<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
		<p>The gang walked confidently out of the elevator and into the mall a couple
		hours later, with Buffy leading and Cordelia beside her. Angel was behind them,
		followed by Giles and Xander (who were carrying the crate that contained the
		weapon), and behind them were Willow and Oz. The guitarist suggested that this
		was where the Judge would go, and he had been right.</p>
		<p>"Everybody keep back. Damage control only. Take out any lesser vamps if
		you can, I'll handle the Smurf." Buffy informed her group.</p>
		<p>"I'm dating a bad-ass." Cordelia grinned happily to herself.</p>

		<p>The Judge was on the second level of the mall, but then he took a few steps
		down. Druscilla was at the top watching, and her security was blocking all the
		exit doors. A man came walking by one side of the Judge, and a couple came
		walking by the other. The ancient demon then extended his arms, and bolts of
		energy emanated from his hands, striking the people. It caused them to freeze,
		while the energy connected to every person in the surrounding area.</p>
		<p>"Oh, goody!" Dru said, gleefully.</p>
		<p>Suddenly, a projectile hit the Judge in the chest, forcing him to lose his
		concentration and halt the killing.</p>
		<p>He yanked it out. "Who dares?"</p>
		<p>Standing on top of a refreshment stand that they had made their way to, Buffy
		had a crossbow in her hand. Her friends were ducking, and Xander was opening up
		the crate.</p>
		<p>"Think I got his attention." She said evenly.</p>

		<p>"You're a fool." The Judge said to her. "No weapon forged can
		stop me."</p>
		<p>Angel, seeing the Judge begin to raise his hand, decided that he had to buy
		Xander and Buffy more time, so he ran out before they could stop him. Druscilla
		spotted him instantly.</p>
		<p>"Punish daddy!" She commanded the Judge, pointing.</p>
		<p>Angel stood rigid. The demon smiled, and began to do what he was asked. His
		energy hit the souled vampire full force.</p>
		<p>"Hey!" Xander handed the slayer a rocket launcher, which she rested
		on her shoulder. "That 'no weapon forged' thing? That was then. This is
		now."</p>

		<p>She powered it up and set her sight, opening the trigger guard. The gang took
		cover, and Druscilla leapt over the railing. The insane vampire was still sane
		enough to know what it was. The Judge saw the strange device however, and was
		confused. That confusion freed Angel though, and despite the fact that he was
		still very much in pain, he managed to scramble backwards.</p>
		<p>"What's that do?" The Judge wondered.</p>
		<p>Buffy pulled the trigger, showing him. A rocket flew right into his chest,
		and he exploded into several hundred pieces. Druscilla was freaking out as those
		pieces rained down on her, and she tried to escape, but her sire tackled her to
		the ground. They struggled on the floor, each trying to get the upper hand, when
		a stake fell out of Angel's coat.</p>
		<p>They both saw it, and lunged. Each getting a hand on it, there was a test of
		strength. He won, gritting his teeth as he got on top of her, and then turning
		the sharp end of the stake toward her chest.</p>
		<p>Druscilla smiled. "I can see mummy. She's calling to me from the moon;
		she wants me to play with her, Angel. In the stars."</p>
		<p>"Go see her again, Dru." He rammed the stake home, and she turned
		to dust.</p>

		<p>Buffy came over to him as the sprinklers switched on, dousing the smoke.
		Getting drenched was quickly becoming a habit. The mall goers were vacating
		fast, and the gang was taking care of the Judge's parts.</p>
		<p>"Are you okay?" She asked.</p>
		<p>"I'm fine. I just...need a minute." He answered her. "Help
		them separate the pieces."</p>
		<p>As she walked away, Angel's eyes darkened and he scowled. "You just
		destroyed our best work. She was art. What is it with you?"</p>
		<p>His face softened then, his eyes widening in fear. "No...it...you
		can't..."</p>

		<p>He scowled again. "I couldn't believe I had to sit back and watch you
		kill Darla. She made us the man we are today. Remember what she felt like?"</p>
		<p>Angel shook his head. He didn't want to remember, because this wasn't
		possible.</p>
		<p>"And why'd you do it? For her? Yeah, and now look where you are. She
		picked a cheerleader over you." He laughed. "That's *really* pathetic.
		It's about time I took back what's mine; you've been running things too long.
		Gotta learn to share."</p>
		<p>"How...?"</p>
		<p>"Go ahead, keep being a choirboy for now. They might get concerned, and
		we don't that. But things are about to get *very* interesting."</p>
