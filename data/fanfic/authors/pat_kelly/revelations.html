<!-- Revelations \ Story -->

<p>Willow, Xander and Cordelia were in the Bronze, sitting at a circular table, listening to
the Dingoes finish up. Looking around, they were glad that kids were populating the club,
and not their parents and teachers. Ethan Rayne teaming with Trick, that stupid candy, and
those poor babies…it was all over. What wasn't over, however, was the attraction Willow
and Xander felt towards each other.</p>

<p>They were so nervous, sitting there, and their anxiety increased as Oz came over. It was
like all of the sudden; one kiss had changed fifteen years of friendship just like that.
But why? Willow had Oz, and she loved him. She had gotten over her crush for Xander a long
time ago, and he had never shown any interest in her before. It had to be a fluke. It had
to be.</p>

<p>"Oz! Hey! Have a seat...except, we don't have any seats." The redhead said to her
boyfriend.</p>

<p>"It's okay. I'll just scrunch in." He said.</p>

<p>They scooted over, and Xander leaned hard against Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Xander, why are you giving me a lap dance?" She asked him, making a face.</p>

<p>"What? I just like you." Xander defended himself weakly.</p>

<p>That's when Willow began to babble. "And that's very beautiful. I think it's great when
two people like two people and want to be close to them instead of anyone else."</p>

<p>Xander agreed, and Oz found the babble cute.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Well put." The guitarist said. He pointed at Willow's cup. "Hey, can I snag a sip?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>She reached for it, but so did Xander. Their hands made contact, and when they felt the
touch, they immediately retracted their arms. As they did that, their arms hit a tray of
drinks a waitress was carrying, and knocked them all down. Xander jumped off his stool to
get them, but he was way too late. The people watching clapped, and he tried to get out of
the situation gracefully, by doing what he did best.</p>

<p>"Thank you! Thank you. Uh, we're here through Saturday. Enjoy the veal." Xander joked.</p>

<p>"Why are you guys so hyper?" Cordelia asked as her boyfriend sat back down.</p>

<p>"Who's hyper?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"So…what does everybody think of Buffy and Faith?" Xander asked quickly.</p>

<p>"You mean do I think they're going out?" Cordelia asked.</p>

<p>Xander choked, and Willow went wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"It's a free country." Oz said.</p>

<p>"You think they are?" The hacker asked.</p>

<p>"You were at Homecoming, right?" Cordelia asked. "Hey, considering her last steady killed
half the class, Faith's a big improvement. Good for them."</p>

<p>Xander needed to take a breath. "That is *you* in there, right?"</p>

<p>Cordelia didn't say a word. She just smiled to herself. Buffy came up to the gang a few
seconds later.</p>

<p>"Hey, guys. Whatcha talking about?"</p>

<p>"You and Faith, oddly enough." Oz said.</p>

<p>"This was a topic of discussion?"</p>

<p>"I know. It's stupid." Cordelia said, tired of the topic. "Listen, I got us credit at
April Fools."</p>

<p>"The dresses?"</p>

<p>"I returned 'em."</p>

<p>"How'd you convince -?"</p>

<p>"I have my ways." Cordelia said with an enigmatic smile.</p>

<p>"Cool. Thanks."</p>

<p>"So *are* you and Faith going out?" Willow asked, not able to drop it.</p>

<p>"Okay…yeah." She took a deep breath. "We are. Objections now please. Going once, going
twice…" When they didn't come, she smiled.</p>

<p>"More power to ya, Buff. You get my thumbs up." Xander said, putting his thumbs up.</p>

<p>"Gee, thanks." She had a sarcastic edge to her voice. She looked at her redheaded friend.
"So…Will, you wanna come?"</p>

<p>"But you said -"</p>

<p>"Slaying." Buffy laughed. "You came last night. Do you wanna come again?"</p>

<p>"Oh." Willow smiled, embarrassed. "Nah. That's okay. Glad you're happy." She squeezed her
friend's hand, showing her support.</p>

<p>"Cordy? You feel like slaying?"</p>

<p>"Oh…I don't know." She sighed. "I'd probably just scare them off again. I mean, I'm sure
word has gotten around about how dangerous I am." Cordelia said, still proud of herself.</p>

<p>Buffy shook her head, amused. "I bet."</p>

<p>Faith came up behind her then, and she put her arm around the brunette's neck.</p>

<p>"Yo, what's up?" Faith said to the gang. She nudged Buffy. "Hey, time to motorvate."</p>

<p>"They wanted to know if we were dating. I gave the affirmative."</p>

<p>Faith got a glint in her eye. "Yep. We're *really* good friends."</p>

<p>She ran her hand through Buffy's hair, slowly and seductively, and Buffy couldn't help but
close her eyes as she felt the sensations. Then, the slayers took off. Willow and Xander
watched them go, mouths hanging open.</p>

<p>"Jeez, you two. Get a grip." Cordelia said.</p>

<p>"That was certainly interesting." Oz said in his usual calm manner. "I almost felt an
expression coming on myself."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy and Faith walked through the cemetery looking for vampires. Giles had come along to
see how the slayers functioned as a duo. It was one of the Council's requirements of him
until they sent a second watcher to Sunnydale. He walked several feet ahead of them, and
Faith was conversing with her partner quietly as they patrolled.</p>

<p>"You didn't get the slightest tingle, B? I don't believe it."</p>

<p>"No, I did not get a thrill out of seeing Giles revert. Can we please drop this?"</p>

<p>"But that T-shirt really showed off his muscles. And that whole rebellious 'tude…" Faith
trailed off.</p>

<p>"I could have done without that."</p>

<p>"Loosen up, Summers. All I'm sayin' is that he'd be a lucky catch."</p>

<p>"For *women*. His age." Buffy insisted. She didn't like thinking of him that way.</p>

<p>"Hey, I find someone attractive, I notice, and point it out." She shrugged. "But I only
look, don't touch. I reserve that special bonus just for you."</p>

<p>"And what a nice bonus it is." Buffy smiled. "You know…vampires!"</p>

<p>"I don't really take the time to get to know…oh."</p>

<p>Two vampires came at them from the side, and Giles was safe ahead of them, seeing the
attackers, as he sat on a bench. The slayers dropped onto their backs, and the vampires
each jumped on them, as they laid side by side. Faith rolled with hers, and got over top
of him, while Buffy kicked hers off and stood up. The Bostonian pulled hers up, and threw
him into a bench.</p>

<p>Buffy waited until her opponent got up, and then tried to punch his face. He blocked it,
as well as her two successive ones. When he tried to retaliate though, she grabbed his
arm, twisted and flipped him onto his back. Faith ran over by the bench, and grabbed her
vampire's foot, as he tried to kick her as he was getting up. She pulled his leg up, and
he lost his balance, falling backward to the ground.
Giles was drinking coffee to keep himself awake, and calmly took notes.</p>

<p>Both slayers waited for the vampires to stand. Buffy round-housed hers in the gut, and
brought her fist to his face. Faith round-housed hers as well, but in the face. She then
hammered her fist into his stomach, and readied her stake. Buffy pushed hers into Faith's,
and the vampires stood back to back. They both plunged their stakes in at the same exact
moment, and as the dust rained down, they gave each other a high-five. They walked over to
Giles.</p>

<p>"Synchronized slaying." Buffy realized.</p>

<p>"New Olympic category?" Faith wondered.</p>

<p>Giles was about to comment on their performance, but a female voice spoke and interrupted
him.</p>

<p>"Sloppy." She said. They all looked at the woman. She was British by the sound of her
voice, and seemed kind of prissy. She was also dressed too formal and conservative for a
cemetery. "You telegraph punches, leave blind sides open and, for a school-night slaying,
take entirely too much time. Which one of you is Faith?"</p>

<p>"Depends. Who the hell are you?" Faith answered.</p>

<p>"Gwendolyn Post, Mrs. Your new Watcher."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The next day, Faith and Buffy sat next to each other in the library, glaring at the
watcher that had arrived. She made fun of Giles, who was in there as well, insulting his
collection of books and his English-ness, by calling him too American. She was entering
their lives, and even though they had no choice, they still didn't like it.</p>

<p>"I'm telling you, I don't need a new Watcher. No offense, lady. I just have this problem
with authority figures. They end up kind of dead." Faith said flatly.</p>

<p>Buffy grasped her hand.</p>

<p>"Duly noted, and fortunately, it's not up to you." Post said, devoid of emotion.</p>

<p>"Bitch." The slayers said under their breaths.</p>

<p>"You need a watcher, Faith. I am to act in that capacity and report back."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Mary Poppins, you don't seem to be listening."</p>

<p>"Faith, if the Council feels that you need closer observation, then...we will all, of
course, cooperate." Giles said, trying to diffuse the situation.</p>

<p>"The Council wishes me to report on the *entire* situation here, including you." Gwendolyn
said, turning to Giles.</p>

<p>"Mm! Academic probation's not so funny today, huh, Giles?" Buffy asked innocently.</p>

<p>"There is a more pressing matter that needs our attention, whether you all like me or not.
A demon named Lagos is coming here to the Hellmouth. Lagos seeks the Glove of Myhnegon. No
record of this glove's full power exists, but we do know it is highly dangerous and must
not fall into the hands of a demon. Lagos must be stopped."</p>

<p>"What do you propose?" Giles asked.</p>

<p>"Well, if it's not too radical a suggestion, I thought we might kill him."</p>

<p>"Bitch." The slayers said quietly, again.</p>

<p>"We believe the glove to be buried in a tomb somewhere, so Lagos will be headed for the
cemetery."</p>

<p>"There is more than one in Sunnydale." Giles told her.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll just have to take them one at a time. Faith, with me please."</p>

<p>The brunette looked at Buffy and Giles. This wasn't something she wanted to do, and by the
look of the blonde's eyes, Buffy didn't want her to go either. But Post had already moved
from the table, and was standing by the doors, waiting on her. Faith stood from her chair,
but before following her new watcher, she leaned down and gave Buffy a quick kiss.</p>

<p>When Buffy and Giles were left alone, he stared at her, as if waiting for an explanation.</p>

<p>"What?" Buffy shrugged.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>That night, Willow and Xander were helping Giles research for the possible location of the
glove Lagos wanted so badly. Well, they weren't actually researching at the moment. They
were doing something completely unproductive, and bad. Making out in the stacks. Giles'
footsteps were coming nearer and nearer to them, but they were too involved to hear.</p>

<p>"Willow, Xander..." Giles said, looking at books, standing just about two feet away from
them. The two friends stopped immediately, and jumped up, nervous. "You can stop your, uh,
studying. I've got what I need."</p>

<p>"What have you got?" Xander asked, trying to make his breathing even.</p>

<p>"The probable location of the Glove of Myhnegon. It's housed in the Von Hauptman family
crypt."</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's that big one over at the Restfield Cemetery."</p>

<p>"Yeah, well, that's great, Giles. Um, how'd you find it?" Willow said, biting her nails.</p>

<p>"I looked." The watcher said, reading.</p>

<p>"Where's Buffy at?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! She's in Shady Hill." Willow remembered.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll go check out this, uh, crypt."</p>

<p>"And I'll go tell Buffy." Willow offered.</p>

<p>"Yes, by all means, go." Giles said, giving them leave.</p>

<p>The two of them got out of there fast.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy was nearing the end of her sweep at Shady Hill Cemetery, with no sign of Lagos or
the glove, when Willow came running up to her, panting.</p>

<p>"What's the rush, Gus?" The slayer asked her friend.</p>

<p>"Gus? Where?" The aspiring wicca searched, until her brain shifted into gear. "Humor.
Right." She caught her breath. "Giles says the glove's inside a crypt at Restfield.
Hauptman. Xander's on his way there already."</p>

<p>"You mean the good guys might actually be a few steps ahead of the baddies for once?
Should happen more often." Buffy said. "I'm almost done here. Then I'll go check it out.
Wanna join me?"</p>

<p>"Sure." They started to walk again. "Uh, not to downplay my own slaying abilities, which
in some circles are considered formidable, but shouldn't Faith be here?"</p>

<p>Willow could have sworn she heard her blonde friend growl.</p>

<p>"She was, but then Miss Biotch thought it would be 'better strategy' to separate and cover
more ground. They went to another cemetery. I suggested Abendale, but I don't think Miss
Biotch listened to me."</p>

<p>"You and Faith don't like Mrs. Post, huh?" Willow smirked.</p>

<p>"We've named her 'Miss Biotch'. Well, Miss 'Bitch', but I was censoring. I know you have
this thing with cursing."</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>"But no. We don't. She's ruining everything! Our routine, our style…grr." Buffy was
seething.</p>

<p>"Do you love her?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Post? Uh…I don't know if you've been listening, but, I don't even *like* her."</p>

<p>Willow giggled. "No. Faith."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled sheepishly. "Whoops. Yeah. I do."</p>

<p>"Really? Have you said it…you know…to each other?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. I think we're getting there, though. I hope we are."</p>

<p>"That's great…that's great. Loving somebody. I love Oz, you know. A lot." Willow
stammered.</p>

<p>"Will?"</p>

<p>It was eating away at her. Willow felt so dirty. Maybe if she told Buffy she would feel
better. She and Xander couldn't keep kissing, and maybe it would help to…</p>

<p>"There's something I have to tell you."</p>

<p>"What?" Buffy stepped closer to her friend</p>

<p>Willow kept her hands moving, shaking, as she spoke. "Okay. This will make me feel better,
right? You know, I always consider myself a good person. Floss, do my homework, never
cheat. But lately, and please don't judge me on this, but I want you to be the first to
know that, that...Xander and I have been kissing," Buffy's jaw dropped, "and that there's
a demon behind you."</p>

<p>Buffy glanced behind her, saw Lagos, and ran at him. She tried to kick him hard in the
stomach, but he didn't even flinch. All it accomplished was knocking her equilibrium off,
which made her fall. Buffy stood, quickly punched Lagos in the face, and spun twice,
giving him two backhands. He blocked her elbow jab, grabbed her arm, lifted her, and
dropped her to the ground.</p>

<p>"Don't...ow." Willow commented, hurting at the sight before her.</p>

<p>The slayer got up, and sidestepped as Lagos aimed his fist at her head, making him hit a
cross that sat atop a headstone. Buffy immediately front-kicked him in the gut, and
round-housed his face and crotch. When he bent over in pain, she saw the battle ax he had
strapped to his back, and grinned. She snagged it, and as Lagos became upright once more,
she swung the ax, and the blade sliced off his head. The body dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>"Yes!" Willow exclaimed.</p>

<p>Buffy came over to her. "So…you and Xander." The redhead cringed. Buffy wasn't going to
say anything, and she didn't want to make her any more uncomfortable. It took a lot of
guts for her just to say it. "Look…why don't you go tell Giles that 'His Ugliness' is
dead, and I'll go get that glove. Some other demon may snatch it."</p>

<p>"That sounds like an idea." Willow said. "A good one too."</p>

<p>Buffy gave her a smile, and the girls went their separate ways. Cordelia, who had heard
the girls and seen them walking as she drove, had stopped, planning to join them. Then she
had heard Willow's admission, watching behind a bush, and got up to go, as well.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>In Restfield, Buffy didn't find the glove in the crypt where Willow said that Giles said
it would be in. She found it a little strange, but it wouldn't have been the first the
first time Giles was somewhat off. And that was a shame, because Post would probably hound
him about it. Not only didn't she find the glove; she also didn't find Xander. She assumed
that when he didn't find the glove, he simply went home.</p>

<p>That sounded like a good plan to Buffy too. As she was leaving though, she realized she
was close to the mansion. She hadn't seen Angel in awhile, and she thought she should
check up on him. She could ask him about the glove too. It was worth a shot.  She went
there, it started off normal enough, and then he kissed her…just like that.</p>

<p>It came out of nowhere. After about two seconds, not even that, she pushed him off and
turned her back on him.</p>

<p>"Oh, God…what are you doing?" She asked him.</p>

<p>"I don't know." He said, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"Shame on you! I told you I was with Faith! I never thought you would ever…"</p>

<p>"Do you love her?" He asked.</p>

<p>"Yes!" She screamed at him without hesitation. He wasn't expecting that, and it looked he
got punched in the gut. She was beyond caring. "I don't even know why I came…wait." She
closed her eyes, and tried to calm down. "You wouldn't know where a glove of
MickieMinnieMouse is, would you?"</p>

<p>"Myhnegon? I have it."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I was walking the other night, and I saw Lagos. He's a demon who -"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I killed him." She said, cutting him off.</p>

<p>"I knew he'd only be here for the glove, and I knew where it was. I took it so it wouldn't
fall into his hands."</p>

<p>"Show me." He led her to a pedestal, where something was wrapped in rags. He carefully
uncovered the object, and the glove sat there. "The world's ugliest fashion accessory."
She commented, moving to touch it.</p>

<p>Angel stopped her. "No, don't. Once you put it on, the glove can never be removed."</p>

<p>"What's it do?"</p>

<p>"You don't wanna have to find out."</p>

<p>"Just…hang on to it. I gotta go. I'll tell Giles in the morning."</p>

<p>As she walked out, Xander moved from his spying spot in the garden, and rushed off.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy came in the library the next morning to find the whole gang sitting at the table,
apparently waiting for her. Faith was there also, absent Post. She breathed a sigh of
relief for that. She happened to notice that Faith was looking at her worriedly, and that
the rest of the gang wasn't very happy.</p>

<p>"Why the glum? I got the magic mitten thingy." They were all silent. "What's going on?"</p>

<p>"We know Angel is alive." Giles said. "Xander saw you with him. It would appear that
you've been hiding him and that you lied to us."</p>

<p>"You didn't seem shocked." Oz said, looking at Faith.</p>

<p>"I…knew." Faith said quietly.</p>

<p>Willow was surprised, and somewhat offended.</p>

<p>"She knew? She knew and I didn't?"</p>

<p>"Will…" Buffy trailed off.</p>

<p>"Did you know she's been kissing him?" Xander asked the dark-haired slayer.</p>

<p>Faith looked at Buffy with a wounded expression, and then she headed for the doors. The
blonde immediately chased after her, and Faith stopped at the doors.
They stood there, speaking in hushed tones.</p>

<p>"He's wrong." She reached for her arm.</p>

<p>Faith shrugged her off. "You didn't kiss him?" Buffy didn't deny it. "Look don't touch,
remember? I know you can't help but look, hell, neither can I, but -"</p>

<p>"It only happened last night. He started…and I stopped it. Right away. I swear. Us, being
together, that's all that matters to me."</p>

<p>"Why should I believe you?"</p>

<p>"Look at me. Am I lying to you?" The brunette wouldn't do it. "Am I?"</p>

<p>Faith finally looked into the other slayer's expressive hazel eyes, and could see that she
was telling the truth.</p>

<p>"I just…God…I love you, Buffy and -"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You heard me."</p>

<p>"Do you…mean that?"</p>

<p>She had just the three-letter word; it was out there. As soon as Xander had said they
were…it was at that moment she realized just how much she cared for Buffy, and it just
came out. She couldn't stop the words, could she form any more, right then.</p>

<p>"I gotta..."</p>

<p>Buffy knew it was better to let her go. They couldn't have the conversation now, anyway.
She walked back to the firing squad. She waited for Xander to say something completely and
totally insensitive, but Cordelia cut him off before he could.</p>

<p>"Say one word to her, one word…" She threatened him. "Just keep your mouth shut. You have
no right." She was angry, and they all didn't know why.</p>

<p>"Cordy…" He tried, confused.</p>

<p>"Hiding Angel was wrong. Kissing him too. But people seem to be doing a lot of things they
shouldn't be doing, and kissing a lot of people they shouldn't be *kissing*, lately."
Xander was like a deer in headlights. "So don't you dare judge her."</p>

<p>Willow had the same expression on her face as Xander. She looked at Buffy, hurt.</p>

<p>"I heard you talking last night." Cordelia said, letting Willow know that Buffy didn't
blab. "And you…you of all people, Willow."</p>

<p>"Okay, I got lost somewhere." Oz said.</p>

<p>"They've been going beyond the friendship line, Oz. As in, lips meeting." In typical
fashion, Oz's face remained stoic, but there was a flicker of pain in his eyes as he
looked at his girlfriend. He silently walked out of the library. "He's got the right
idea."</p>

<p>Cordelia followed him.</p>

<p>"Oz!"</p>

<p>"Cordy!"</p>

<p>The friends chased after their respective others, leaving the library.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy and Giles were the only two people left in the library.</p>

<p>"That was something, huh?" Buffy asked weakly.</p>

<p>Giles looked at her, hard. "You must've known it was wrong seeing Angel or you wouldn't
have hidden it from all of us."</p>

<p>"I was going to tell you, I was. I…was just that I...I didn't know why he came back. I
wanted to get answers."</p>

<p>"And you didn't believe I would help you find them?"</p>

<p>"I just…wasn't sure how you'd react and -"</p>

<p>"I would have known that you trusted and respected me." He said, feeling pain at the fact
that Buffy didn't inform him.</p>

<p>"That's not fair, Giles." She said, defensive.</p>

<p>"Must I remind you that Angel tortured me...for hours...for pleasure?"</p>

<p>Buffy looked at her feet. "I didn't forget." She said softly, and then looked at him. "I
should've told you. I'm sorry. It was a bad decision, but at the time, I was just doing
what I thought was right. I don't know…it all happened so fast, and…I wanted to help him
get -"</p>

<p>"He's a murderer, Buffy. You know that."</p>

<p>"I never told you what happened that night, did I?"</p>

<p>"What nig…?" His eyes widened.</p>

<p>"I was about to behead him, end it, and then he got his soul back. He had no clue what was
going on, and Acathla's mouth was opening. He didn't remember, but I had to save the
world. I shoved the sword through his gut, and sent him to Hell. Not the demon, but the
man. The *person* I loved. I condemned him to Hell. I did that to him."</p>

<p>Giles was stunned. "Buffy…"</p>

<p>She ignored him. "He came back a few weeks ago. Hell had made him…like a beast, and I
chained him up in the mansion. I didn't know what to do. Then he saved my life. Killed
Pete. After everything, he still…</p>

<p>She sighed. "Anyway…he was back, but he was in so much pain…all I felt was guilt. *I*
broke his curse, and *I* sent him to Hell, letting him get tortured there because he had a
soul. I wasn't hiding him out of disrespect, Giles. I just wanted to help him, and I
didn't think anyone else would. Why would they?</p>

<p>"Do you understand? I'm responsible. It was my fault. I owe it to him. Once I was sure he
was…I was going to tell everyone…" She trailed off, exhausted.</p>

<p>Giles walked up to her, and she leaned into his chest as he embraced her.</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>"Please don't hate me." She said softly. "I couldn't stand it if you did. If I ended up
with a watcher like -"</p>

<p>He laughed quietly. "I don't hate you. But you do understand why Angel…"</p>

<p>"You don't like him. He doesn't expect you too. I don't expect you too. Besides, I'm not
liking him much right now, either."  She broke off the hug. "Kissing me…when he knows…"</p>

<p>"So there's no risk then of him…ever…?"</p>

<p>"No." She shook her head. "Not anymore. We're over. Faith and I…"</p>

<p>"I gathered as much from…what happened." He paused. "I want you to know, that you can tell
me anything. You don't have to be scared about how may or may not take it. And if you say
that Angel is cured, then I'll take your word for it."</p>

<p>"I will. From now on. I promise." She smiled. "He's holding onto the glove."</p>

<p>"You may want to tell him to destroy it. I'd assume he knows the procedure. If he doesn't,
I can give you book that outlines it."</p>

<p>"Okay. I think I need to do damage control with Faith first, though."</p>

<p>He smiled. "There's no rush. Lagos is dead. You made sure of that."</p>

<p>"What can I say? I know how to handle axes."</p>

<p>"Good luck with Faith."</p>

<p>Gwendolyn Post quietly walked out of the library, with a smile, after hearing every word.
They didn't notice her at all.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy returned home after school to find Faith not there. Her mother told her that Faith
had come home for awhile, watched TV for a little bit, and then announced she was going
for a walk. Buffy had been searching for her with no luck.</p>

<p>She didn't love Angel the way she used to anymore, and she didn't know if Faith really
knew that or not. If she could find her, Buffy would tell her who she loved now, and she
was pretty positive that Faith would like the answer.</p>

<p>"Looking for your girl?" Buffy turned her head to see where the voice was coming from, to
see Cordelia driving slowly, following her as she walked. "Lift? Could probably search
faster that way."</p>

<p>Buffy smiled, and got in the passenger seat. They started driving again.</p>

<p>"Xander find you?"</p>

<p>"Got lots of messages. I'm avoiding."</p>

<p>"How about Willow and Oz?"</p>

<p>Cordelia shrugged. "You're not going to try and defend them, are you?"</p>

<p>"Like I'm in a position to do that?" Buffy asked with a half-smile smile. "I'd just…try
and hear them out. They're good people."</p>

<p>"I know. That's why it hurts so much." Cordelia said, sadly.</p>

<p>"Do you think that's what Faith's doing? Avoiding me?"</p>

<p>"Maybe." The brunette said. "But I'll tell you this. If I was a slayer, and my current
honey's ex was a vampire and tried to steal a kiss, I'd use my super strength to -"</p>

<p>"Stake him."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>In the mansion, Angel had already thought of destroying the glove. He was in the middle of
creating the living flame necessary to get the job done. He was standing over a fire he
had going in a small urn, and he surrounded himself by several different-colored powders.</p>

<p>"Exorere, Flamma Vitae. Prodi ex loco tuo elementorum, in hunc mundum vivorum."</p>

<p>He picked up some green powder into his hand, and dropped it into the fire. The flame
turned green.</p>

<p>"Exorere, Flamma Vitae. Prodi ex loco tuo elementorum, in hunc mundum vivorum."</p>

<p>He picked up some red powder into his hand, and dropped it into the fire. The flame turned
from green to red. He turned to get the glove then, but saw that a woman had been standing
behind him. He eyed her suspiciously.</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Gwen Post. Mr. Giles sent me." She answered him.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"To help you destroy the glove." She headed to the table that had the urn. "Is that the
Living Flame?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Look, I'm sorry to be so abrupt, but Lagos is on his way here now." She was lying; he
knew it. Lagos was dead. "If you're performing the ritual incorrectly, it will only make
the glove more powerful."</p>

<p>"Alright."</p>

<p>"Good. Where is the glove?"</p>

<p>"It's in the trunk."</p>

<p>He turned his back on her, going to move for the trunk. She then grabbed a shovel that was
leaning against the table, and hit him over the head with it. He dropped to the ground.
She hurried over to the trunk, but she couldn't break the padlock with her hands, so she
used the shovel. It broke easily, and that's when Angel got up, his vampiric face showing.</p>

<p>"Okay...that hurt."</p>

<p>She had hoped he would've stayed out long enough for her to get the glove, but it didn't
matter. Post snapped the shovel handle off, and created a stake.</p>

<p>"I believe this is your poison."</p>

<p>She swung at Angel's midsection, but he sidestepped. She swung again, going for his face,
and he ducked. She tried once more, but that time he blocked it, and struck her in the
face. She fell under his powerful hit, dropping to all fours. As Angel was walking up to
her to go for a second round, Faith ran in, and tackled him to the ground. She didn't
realize that Post was in there, and the woman took advantage of the distraction, heading
back to the trunk.</p>

<p>Faith was just hitting him repeatedly, over and over. She wasn't saying a word, just
fuming with anger at what he did. She had been thinking for awhile. About what she
admitted to Buffy, and what to do. She believed the blonde, but she was still pissed at
him.</p>

<p>She was hurt, and he was the cause. She intended to hurt him back. Angel couldn't knock
her off. Faith was on an adrenaline rush, and she was taking advantage of that. After a
few moments, she felt hands on her shoulders. She knew they were Buffy's.</p>

<p>"Faith! Stop!"</p>

<p>"Why should I stop, B?" She seethed, turning her head sharply. "Let me do this!"</p>

<p>Buffy pointed to something, and Faith looked. "That's why."</p>

<p>Post had gotten the glove, and was putting it on her hand. Cordelia had followed Buffy in,
and knew instinctively that the woman putting the glove on, was a bad thing. She figured
she could take her, so she ran over and was preparing a fist to knock her out. Post saw
her though, and backhanded her hard to the ground. The glove's claws then clamped onto
Post's arm.</p>

<p>"Finally." The woman said, psychotically. The slayers were now watching, and Angel had
stood up. "Taou huogan maqachte milegaing!"</p>

<p>They moved to attack her, but then lightening and thunder crackled in the sky, and the
wind began to pick up.</p>

<p>"Tauo freim!" She yelled, pointing her gloved hand at them.</p>

<p>Lighting shot out, and they dove out of the way.</p>

<p>"I knew she was a bitch!" Faith yelled.</p>

<p>"Angel, help Cordelia!" He ran over to the fallen cheerleader, as Buffy turned to Faith.
"Can you draw her fire?"</p>

<p>"You bet I can."</p>

<p>"Let's take the bitch down."</p>

<p>Faith ran into a hallway, and kept running. Thinking that Faith would come out of the
hallway at the other end of the room, Post aimed there.</p>

<p>"Tauo freim!"</p>

<p>A bolt shot out. Faith did appear where Post thought she would, but the slayer quickly
dove behind the couch Angel had. Buffy ran to the window, smashed it with her elbow, and
grabbed one of the shards. Post heard the noise, and turned in Buffy's direction.</p>

<p>"There's nothing you can do to me now. I have the glove. With the glove comes the power."</p>

<p>"I'm getting that." Buffy said, holding up the shard.</p>

<p>Post looked at her, eyes wide in surprise. The blonde threw the shard with all the
strength she had, and it flew out of her hand fast, spinning quicker and quicker. It cut
through the insane woman's upper arm, severing it, and the glove, from her body. The glove
started to shake, and now that it wasn't attached to anything, the lightning it controlled
came in through the skylight, and hit Post dead on.</p>

<p>She screamed and screeched as bolts continually hit her. Finally, she vanished in a
bright, white light, and the stormy weather went with her. Buffy had had her eyes closed,
and opened them to see Faith stand up from behind the couch. Angel got off of Cordelia,
and helped her up. Faith walked over to her fellow slayer, and they watched as the glove
unclamped itself from the arm it had been attached to.</p>

<p>"Ouch." Buffy said, grimacing.</p>

<p>"She deserved it. Great employees that Council has." Faith said sarcastically. Buffy
looked at her. "Giles being the exception."</p>

<p>They looked back to make sure Cordelia was okay. The girl smiled weakly.</p>

<p>"How about you?" Buffy asked Faith. "You okay?"</p>

<p>"Yeah." Faith sighed. "You know, I wasn't going to dust him, B. I just wanted to beat the
crap out of him a little."</p>

<p>"I don't blame you." Buffy had to grin. "Looked like you were doing a good job too." She
paused. "Faith…"</p>

<p>Faith smiled. "I meant it."</p>

<p>Buffy hugged her. "I hoped you'd say that. Because I love you too."</p>

<p>"I've never had anyone love me before."</p>

<p>"You should have." She squeezed harder, tightening the hug. "I'd never intentionally hurt
you. You *do* believe me…right?"</p>

<p>"Kiss me." Buffy was happy to oblige. "Oh yeah. I believe ya." The brunette was glowing.
"Was I better?"</p>

<p>Cordelia came up to them. "Ready to get outta here? I know I am."</p>

<p>"I'll make sure the glove gets destroyed." Angel said.</p>

<p>"Thanks." Buffy said. She stared at him and tried to smile, but she was still a little
angry.</p>

<p>The three exhausted girls made their way out of the mansion, and when Buffy was sure she
was out of Angel's earshot, she spoke.</p>

<p>"Yes. You were."</p>

<p>"Good answer." Cordelia said, proud of Buffy.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The following day, Faith, Buffy, Xander, and Willow were sitting in the school lounge.
Cordelia was sitting there also, at Buffy's request. Oz, however, was not. Everyone felt
the uncomfortable-ness.</p>

<p>"Look at the lovebirds." Xander said. Faith glared. "Okay, don't look."</p>

<p>"You got me all worked up over..." She trailed off. "Who knows what coulda happened?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry." He said, genuinely apologetic. "But don't you feel better?"</p>

<p>Faith grinned. "Okay. Maybe I do."</p>

<p>"Are we cool?" Buffy asked her friends.</p>

<p>"Yeah! Just seeing the two of you kissing after everything that happened…I trust you."
Xander said.</p>

<p>"That won't happen again. Ever." She snuggled closer to Faith. "Willow? I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"It's…ok." But she looked distracted, like she really wasn't paying attention to what
Buffy had said. She had a lot on her mind. "Cordelia -"</p>

<p>"Don't really wanna talk." Cordelia said flatly.</p>

<p>"How you feeling, Cor?" Faith asked.</p>

<p>"Physically? Still a little shaky, but I'm recovering."</p>

<p>Giles came over then, and they all shifted so he could have a seat.</p>

<p>"Let me guess. Gwendolyn Post, not a Watcher." Buffy said.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what she was. A bitch." Faith stated.</p>

<p>"Oh. Definitely."</p>

<p>"Yes, she was. A Watcher." Giles said with a slight smirk. "She was…kicked out by the
Council a couple of years ago for misuses of dark power. They swear there was a memo."</p>

<p>"I can't believe we work for those assholes." The brunette said. After about five minutes
of silence, she started to get fidgety. "Anybody else sick of this place?"</p>

<p>They looked at one another and all wordlessly got up and left the building. There were two
hours of school still left.</p>
