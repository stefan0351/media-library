<!-- Girls Smell Nice -->

<P>CaveSlayer sat on a bench outside the burned college Grotto.
Not paying any attention to the police and fire trucks, she was focused on
something else. Willow, who was sitting next to her. She was fiddling with her
hair. Giles was standing at the side, and watched as Xander walked
over.</P>
<P>"Did you guys have enough fun for one night?" He
asked.</P>
<P>"Yes. Please." Willow said, and went to remove her friend's
hand. </P>
<P>Instead she caught her temporarily primitive-minded friend's
eyes, and decided not to. She felt oddly comforted by it. Buffy was paying more
attention to her couple strands of hair, than Oz had paid attention to her in
the last two days. </P>
<P>Veruca. Slut Singer. Vile. Boyfriend-stealing. She wanted to
scream. Murder her. She stopped her rage from building, when Buffy took her hand
away. She frowned just a little.</P>
<P>"Buffy tired." CaveSlayer said.</P>
<P>"And was there a lesson in all this? Huh? What did we learn
about beer?" Xander asked.</P>
<P>"Foamy!" She said quickly.</P>
<P>"Good. Just as long as that's clear. Anyways, I think the
boys in the car are contained for the time being…"</P>
<P>Buffy shot up, and went over to her cavemen compatriots, and
started banging on the window.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Willow watched as Buffy looked into the van. And then came
Devil Man himself. Parker. He called Buffy's name, and she turned around
sharply. He was "apologizing." God, she wanted to murder him too. Making Buffy
hurt as much as he did.</P>
<P>Was Oz like him? Doing the nice guy act until they slept
together, and now he was off looking for another girl? Only a lot more suddle
than Parker? No, not Oz. He just wasn't that type of guy.</P>
<P>"But…Buffy was fooled by Parker…who seemed like a nice
guy…and maybe…" She muttered to herself.</P>
<P>"What was that, Will?" Xander asked.</P>
<P>"Nothing." She sighed.</P>
<P>She looked back up at Buffy and Parker. He wasn't talking
anymore, and Buffy was just staring at him. She saw the large stick Buffy still
held in her hand, come up, and then he got clobbered over the head with
it.</P>
<P>Willow grinned, and walked over with Giles and Xander to
Buffy, and they all looked down at Parker's unconscious form. Xander pulled
Buffy away, but she got out of his grip and grabbed Willow's arm. She
sniffed.</P>
<P>"Girl smell nice."</P>
<P>"Uh, thanks, Buffy." Willow said, unsure. She blushed
slightly, and they went towards the dorm.</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Willow opened their door, and Buffy shuffled inside. She
turned around to Giles and Xander.</P>
<P>"Are you sure you'll be all right for the night, Willow?"
Giles asked.</P>
<P>"I can take care of her. Don't worry."</P>
<P>"Don't get her angry. Leads to pain." Xander said
cautiously.</P>
<P>"Got it. Night, guys."</P>
<P>"Good night." Giles said.</P>
<P>She went inside, and shut the door. Buffy was sitting on her
own bed.</P>
<P>"You gonna be okay?" She asked. Buffy nodded quickly. "Cause
I don't think I am."</P>
<P>Willow sat down on the edge of her bed, and then fell
back.</P>
<P>"I mean, Oz and this…Veruca. What does he see in her? I
haven't changed. I'm still me. Maybe that's the problem. I think I'm this super
expert on guys, giving you advice, when my boyfriend may be just like
Parker."</P>
<P>"Parker bad." Buffy called.</P>
<P>"Yes he is. And why am I talking to you about this? You
can't even understand me." Buffy shrugged, and began moving her finger, and
letting her eyes follow it. "I'm gonna shower."</P>
<P>Buffy jumped up and hit the TV. </P>
<P>"People!"</P>
<P>"Okay, I'll turn the TV on. You know, you're destroying the
few brains cells you have right now." Buffy jumped as the pictures came on
screen. "And you don't care."</P>
<P align=center>***</P>
<P>Willow came out of the bathroom in all flannel, and found
Buffy, lying in her bed.</P>
<P>"Your bed's over there."</P>
<P>"Girl here?"</P>
<P>"Yes." Willow pointed to herself and then the bed. "Girl
there. Don't you want to go over to your own bed?"</P>
<P>"Like girl. Like bed. Wanna stay. Girl no like Buffy?" She
pouted.</P>
<P>"No! No! I like you! I like you!" Willow said quickly, and
reassuringly. Buffy smiled, and patted the bed. </P>
<P>Willow didn't want to refuse CaveSlayer, and she didn't
really mind sleeping next to her either, so she laid down next to her. Buffy put
her arm protectively around Willow's body, and Willow reached up and turned off
the light.</P>
<P>A few minutes later, in the darkness, Buffy
spoke.</P>
<P>"I understood everything you said, Will."</P>
<P>"You did? You're back?"</P>
<P>"Been back."</P>
<P>"Since when?"</P>
<P>"Since I saw the fire. Once the Slayer in me snapped to
attention, well, not even beer can stop that. No matter how foamy." </P>
<P>What she didn't add was, the effects wore off when she saw
Willow in the fire. She'd hold off on that though.</P>
<P>"And you didn't say anything?"</P>
<P>"It was fun."</P>
<P>"Parker?"</P>
<P>"I should've hit him a third time. And listen. About
Oz…"</P>
<P>"Yeah?"</P>
<P>"He'd be an idiot to give you up."</P>
<P>"Really?" Willow smiled.</P>
<P>"Absolutely. And I'll always be here for you."</P>
<P>"I hope so."</P>
<P>"Oh, one more thing." Willow waited. "You really do smell
nice."</P>
