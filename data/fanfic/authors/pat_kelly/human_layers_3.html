<!-- Human Layers \ Part Three -->

<p>Slowly bringing her foot over the sill of her bedroom window, Buffy quietly
entered her house after an extended patrol. Reaching out and grabbing her bag of
supplies from where she had hooked it on the tree branch, she brought it inside,
breathing a sigh of relief. When the vampires were track team stars in life, it
made her job substantially harder, and left her winded beyond belief.</p>
<p>Closing the window, she glanced at her clock. Just after one. Meant she'd
have to shower before school. Unless she wanted her mother up, asking her an
endless string of questions that would finish with a grounding. Nope, she'd
rather not. But it was a shame, because she smelled extra stinky tonight. She
took off her jacket, and tossed it on her chair, when her phone began ringing.</p>
<p>Correction. It was a half of a ring. The instant she heard the noise, she
shot over to the phone and picked it up so fast that she'd give the speed of
light a run for its money.</p>
<p>"Figures." It was Cordelia.</p>
<p>They had conversed almost nightly for the past two weeks, so hearing her
voice wasn't exactly a surprise, but she had never called this late. Staring at
her door in fear, if Buffy could, she would've reached into the receiver and
strangled the brunette. Her mother was a dangerous woman, and not very forgiving
about curfew breakage. Especially if she was awoken in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>"Are you trying to get me locked...?" Buffy yawned, and her anger
faded away. "What figures?" She kept her voice low and started taking
off her shoes.</p>

<p>"That the exchange student you end up with is a five-hundred-year-old
mummy. It's like fate has it in for you twenty-four-seven."</p>
<p>"Do I have to tell you how much that *didn't* brighten my mood? And that
was what? A week ago?"</p>
<p>"Popped into my head. I knew you'd probably be done the graveyard shift
by now, seeing as you have no social life, so I thought I'd share."</p>
<p>Buffy rolled her eyes, going to her dresser. "Don't make me bring up
your one-hundred percent Swedish guy."</p>
<p>She could picture the scowl. "Okay, okay."</p>
<p>"You at home?"</p>
<p>"Uh huh. My parents went to one of their weekly, 'we can show off how
rich we are' parties, and I didn't feel like going."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"And waste my best fake smiles on fat guys and their anorexic wives? No
thank you. I'm not as stuck up as people think."</p>
<p>"I didn't mean..." She looked at the tank top she had pulled out.
"Everybody hides."</p>
<p>"Anyway, it's pretty much guaranteed that my father's gonna get loaded,
and my mother doesn't drive, so I'm waiting for her to call and tell me to come
get them. That's the reason I'm up." She exhaled into the phone. "God,
I can see the bags already."</p>
<p>"What does your father do? I always wondered."</p>
<p>"He invests. According to him, his father was rich cause of an oil well
somewhere, and we inherited everything when my grandparents died. One day I
swear he's gonna pick the wrong stock or whatever." She paused. "What
about yours?"</p>

<p>Buffy thought as she was getting changed. "Something with numbers."
Cordelia laughed. "I have no idea. And that's sad, cause I spent an entire
summer with him. We're not as close as we used to be."</p>
<p>"It had to be tough. The divorce, I mean."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah. Plus, unlike most kids who only *think* they had something to
do with their parents' divorce, I *know* I helped it to happen."</p>
<p>"I'm sure you didn't." Buffy was silent. "I've never been
close to my parents. They gave me a credit card when I was eight, bought me what
I wanted, but no hugs or signs of affection of any kind. I didn't realize I was
missing out, though. Money means love in my family."</p>
<p>"I've been there." She told the brunette sadly. "My mom didn't
start doing the parenting thing till we moved here. She reads 'How To'
books."</p>

<p>This was fun.</p>
<p>"Am I the only one getting depressed?" Cordelia questioned after a
moment.</p>
<p>"I'm about ready for a new topic." She rubbed her face.</p>
<p>"New topic it is. What're you doing?"</p>
<p>"Currently? Getting in bed." She wasn't receiving a response.
"Cordy?"</p>

<p>"So the whole time we've...?"</p>
<p>"I've been changing." Buffy grinned.</p>
<p>"And why wouldn't you?" Cordelia got quiet again. "Right.
Yeah. I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, I met this guy at the Pump yesterday.
He's a senior at Crestwood, and...he invited me to a party tomorrow night. At
his fraternity."</p>
<p>"A frat guy?" <i>'Don't be jealous...don't be jealous...'</i></p>
<p>"That a problem?"</p>

<p>"No!" She cringed. That was loud. "Just...what does this have
to do with me?"</p>
<p>"I'm allowed to bring, and I quote, 'a female guest.' I want you to come
with me, cause I've never been...and...what if..."</p>
<p>"Things get outta hand?"</p>
<p>"Could you?"</p>
<p>Buffy's door opened then, and Joyce came in.</p>
<p>"Buffy?" Her mother saw her lying in bed, phone in her hand.
"Who are you talking to at this hour?"</p>

<p>"Uh...Cordelia." Joyce's eyebrows raised. "I couldn't sleep,
and we have a project to do for, uh, a class that we're in, so I thought we
should...discuss it?"</p>
<p>"Nice one." Cordelia said sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Oh." Joyce said. "Well...say good night in a few minutes. You
have school in the morning."</p>
<p>"Sure thing, mom."</p>
<p>With that she left, and Buffy couldn't decide whether to laugh or to groan.</p>

<p>"Good thing she's not very with it, cause that was the lamest cover
story I've ever heard." The slayer narrowed her eyes. "Don't think I
don't know what you're doing."</p>
<p>She smiled. "I should tell you to go to hell, but yes, I'll tag along.
You're too attractive to die."</p>
<p>"Thank you! I've been saying that for a year and a half now. I didn't
think anyone was paying attention."</p>
<p>Both girls stayed on the phone with each other for about thirty minutes more,
but didn't say a word.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Hey, reptile boy!" Buffy yelled to Machida, a giant half-man,
half-snake.</p>

<p>Eyes glued to the creature, the slayer had to recap. She and Cordelia had
come to the Zeta Kappa house, and the cheerleader had found the guy she'd met,
Richard. It started out all right, until Buffy had to watch them dance. She
didn't particularly enjoy the view all that much. Truth be told, she hated the
view. She had wanted to be blind.</p>
<p>This caused her to drink a little. Which probably hadn't been the brightest
idea. Fortunately, no, that was unfortunately now, another frat brother had come
up to her. He had introduced himself as Tom Warner, and then sweet-talked her
well enough to get her to dance with him. It made her feel better; she didn't
have to look at Cordelia any longer.</p>
<p>After that point, things had become blurry. Why? Because her drink had been
drugged. They had apparently gotten Cordelia the same way, and together, they
were taken to the basement. Which was a big, cave-like area for ritual
sacrifices to a snake-god named Machida. Human girl sacrifices.</p>
<p>They were chained up next to another girl, where they watched the frat
boys/psycho cultists call Machida to dinner, so that it could give them more
wealth and power. Tom had been nominated leader. He was not a nice guy, and
Buffy knew that some minor intoxication was the most likely cause of her slayer
senses fouling up, though she preferred to point fingers at Tom's imaginary
hypnotist powers. But she had to free herself.</p>
<p>Couldn't she ever go out and have a normal night of underage drinking?</p>
<p>"No woman speaks to him!" Tom warned her, holding a sword, decked
out in his cult robe.</p>
<p>"You don't want her. Look at her. She's all skin and bones. Half an hour
later you'll be hungry."</p>
<p>"If I didn't depend on you to get me the hell out of here, I'd be so
-" The brunette began to say.</p>

<p>Cordelia was the first course.</p>
<p>"I didn't give you permission to talk!" He prepared to backhand
her.</p>
<p>"Touch her and you'll regret it." Buffy threatened.</p>
<p>"Speak again and I cut your throat." He walked away.</p>
<p>Cordelia smiled, and did her best to whisper. "I've been thinking, and
considering that we're having 'special bondage time,' it's not like I had much
of a choice." The slayer coughed. Unique wording. "It's all making
sense now. Must be because I'm about to die. Hey! You know what? The universe is
pretty damn unfair. But isn't there a name for...? Moment of clarity! That's it,
right?"</p>

<p>Buffy was mouthing 'shut up,' as now wasn't the time for a revelation, but
Cordelia wasn't comprehending.</p>
<p>"Forget it, doesn't matter. Cause this is the important part. I have an
idea about how we should start to handle this...thing. You know, this *thing*. I
can do denial if I have to, but we should face it. If we survive."</p>
<p>"His hunger is at its greatest!" Tom turned around, and Cordelia
got quiet. Two brothers then unchained, and held her. Noise was coming from
upstairs. "Something's going on. Go. Go!" Several guys ran up, while
Buffy continued to work on breaking her chains. "Feed, Dark Lord!"</p>
<p>Machida rose above Cordelia, and she screamed at it while struggling
desperately. Buffy tugged hard at her chains one final time, and they snapped
loose from the ceiling. She stepped over to Machida, who had lowered to grab his
meal, and she punched him. The creature pulled away, holding the side of his
face. Buffy started fighting the frat guys as Tom took a swing at her with his
sword.</p>
<p>"You bitch! I'll serve you to him in pieces."</p>
<p>He lunged, but she caught him between the blades of her chains, looped it
around his neck, and choked.</p>

<p>"Tom, you talk too much." She said, shoving him into a table.</p>
<p>Machida grabbed Cordelia and started to drag her, as the gang, led by Giles
and Angel, came down the stairs. Angel had discovered a bracelet with blood on
it near the south wall of the cemetery, and the college happened to be behind
it. He went to the school looking for Buffy, and Willow and Giles told him where
she was. The librarian hadn't been too happy about it.</p>
<p>Xander was already there, having gone to protect her. He had an...interesting
time.</p>
<p>Sooner or later they had figured it out, and here they were, watching Buffy
pick up Tom's sword and jump onto the edge of the well that the snake had exited
from.</p>
<p>"Let her go, wormy!" The slayer yelled.</p>
<p>It ignored her, so Buffy lifted the sword and drove the weapon into it.
Machida dropped Cordelia and reared back, screeching in pain. A moment later he
collapsed to the ground, dead. Willow came down the steps and went over to help
the other girl, and Buffy helped Cordelia to stand.</p>
<p>"What I tell ya? Fate has it in for you." The brunette said,
brushing herself off. "But I'm okay with that. At least your life's not
dull."</p>

<p>"Nice to know you approve." Buffy smirked.</p>
<p>"Well, just be glad a small part of me likes you, or I'd never take you
anywhere again."</p>
<p>"You *wanted* me to come, remember?"</p>
<p>"This isn't the time to get technical, Buffy." Cordelia sighed.
"People will really do anything to get rich, won't they?"</p>
<p>"It's creepy."</p>
<p>"It's sick."</p>

<p>"But luckily, you're one of the privileged few. You don't have to feed a
demon man-snake to avoid welfare." Cordelia frowned slightly. "That
was supposed to be..." Buffy felt like an idiot. "Sorry."</p>
<p>"Have a nice night, ladies?" Xander asked, coming over after
looking down at the snake and grimacing.</p>
<p>"Wonderful." Buffy said sarcastically, studying his face. "Is
that -?"</p>

<p>"Lipstick?" Cordelia finished, shaking it off.</p>
<p>Xander laughed nervously. "Did somebody hit the sauce? We all know men
don't wear makeup. Come on, think of the craziness! Society would crumble!"</p>
<p>"Unless you're a -"</p>
<p>"I'm a man! The manliest!" He insisted. "Aren't I,
Giles?"</p>
<p>Giles came up to them, shooting Xander a look. "Are you all right?"</p>

<p>"We're fine. But could you spare us the irresponsible speech? We've
learned our lesson, really, so you don't have to worry. College can wait."
Buffy told him.</p>
<p>"Boy, can it ever." The cheerleader agreed.</p>
<p>"I'm pleased to hear that." He smiled.</p>
<p>Buffy looked at their fellow ex-prisoner, who was supported by Willow.
"I'm sure she's got people wondering where she is."</p>
<p>"I'll make sure she gets home."</p>

<p>"And I'll make sure the police get him." Angel picked up Tom by the
collar on his robe.</p>
<p>"Thanks." She smiled gratefully.</p>
<p>Cordelia tried not to look. "They better put him away. For
fifteen-thousand years!" Her eyes widened. "That reminds me. My
idea."</p>
<p>"If we survive?" Buffy repeated the brunette's earlier words.

"There was doubt?"</p>
<p>"No...I just, wasn't ruling anything out, that's all."</p>
<p>"Uh huh." She huffed. "And what was with, 'special bondage
time'?"</p>
<p>Cordelia gaped. "There's no way I'm answering that." She grabbed
Buffy by the arm, and began dragging her upstairs. "Enjoy the gutter?"</p>
<p>Willow stared after them, oddly. There was something she didn't know.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">***</p>
<p>Halloween. It was a time of costumes, candy, and principal-enforced
trick-or-treating. The gang was among the many number of students 'asked' to
chaperone groups of little kids while they got the townspeople to give them
candy. Buffy was getting ready in her room, putting on the earrings that would
complete the 17<sup>th</sup> century gown and black wig ensemble that she had
purchased from a new costume shop, Ethan's.</p>
<p>Her friends had gotten their costumes from there, too. Willow picked a ghost
outfit, and Xander, a toy gun. He had military fatigues at home. Well, not all
her friends had. Cordelia bought a cat outfit from PartyTown. Buffy hadn't seen
it yet, but the cheerleader had made sure to describe it in very detailed terms
on the phone yesterday. If she didn't know better, she would've thought Cordelia
was flirting with her.</p>
<p>But she didn't say anything. She was just going to go along with her idea,
they were going to figure things out in the meantime, and she wasn't going to
picture Cordelia in a skin-tight cat suit. Right now, they were friends. They
had definitely achieved that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Willow was in the bathroom getting changed. After the redhead had gotten the
ghost, Buffy had a flash of inspiration. She took Willow to another place and
made her choose something that would show off just how appealing she could be.
Willow was not ugly, and the slayer thought it was about time she knew that.
She'd have people lining up to take her out if she just had confidence in
herself.</p>
<p>While there was more to a person than just their body, once someone was okay
with him or herself physically, everything else would fall into place. That was
Buffy's theory anyway, and that's what she hoped she could do for Willow.</p>
<p>"Where're you meeting Angel?" The hacker asked.</p>

<p>"I'm not, actually. I turned him down." Buffy said slowly.</p>
<p>"Why?" Her tone was one of surprise.</p>
<p>"Um...all we had planned was eating the candy that's downstairs, and...I
heard vampires don't like chocolate?" She waited. "You're not buying
it, are you?"</p>
<p>"Nope."</p>
<p>Buffy resigned to fate. It was bound to happen. Telling someone was the next
step, and since they were cautiously moving out of denial land, who better to
tell than her best friend?</p>

<i>
<p>'Here goes.'</p>
</i>
<p>"It's...Cordelia."</p>
<p>Willow opened the door and rushed out, shaking her finger. "I knew it! I
knew it! Well, not 'knew it' in the sense of having the slightest idea, but I
knew there was something I didn't know."</p>
<p>Buffy looked her over and smiled. "Wow. You're a dish. I mean,
really."</p>
<p>Her friend was wearing boots, a short, black leather skirt and a burgundy,
long-sleeved, V-necked, midriff-baring top. She quickly grabbed her ghost sheet
off the bed and held it in front of her.</p>
<p>"Don't change the subject, Buffy. It won't work."</p>
<p>"See? More confident already." She wasn't backing down; the resolve
face was staring at her. "You're right. And I'm gonna tell you, but you
have to promise not to freak." Willow nodded. "I like her; I'm just
not sure how much yet."</p>

<p>"Cordelia? Like? Those words don't go together. They hate each
other."</p>
<p>"Yes, Cordelia." Buffy smiled, thinking. "Maybe the beginning
would help."</p>
<p>"Maybe."</p>
<p>Buffy proceeded to give a brief synopsis of the past couple months, which
left her friend, slack-jawed.</p>
<p>"Whaddaya think?"</p>
<p>"I think...I think I need to sit." Willow sat on the bed. "Cordelia.
Cordelia? That's not rational. That's as irrational as you can get, in
fact."</p>

<p>"I know, believe me. But...I don't know. She's...there's more to her
than she lets on."</p>
<p>"To Cordelia?" She nearly choked.</p>
<p>"Will..." Buffy sighed. Apparently sixteen years of dislike was
hard to break through. "We talk almost every night. For hours, sometimes.
About personal stuff. I was just like her once. Worse even, but somewhere, I did
have layers. Hidden ones, but they were there. So why can't she?"</p>
<p>"Because she's Cordelia. She's mean, she's rude, she's evil..."</p>
<p>"She's defensive and afraid, too. And hasn't she been nicer
lately?"</p>
<p>"Well, when she comes around, she doesn't really make fun of Xander like
she used to...and when she does, they're not as good..." Willow gasped.

"How much do you like her? How much does she like you?"</p>
<p>"We're working on that." She paused. "Listen, Xander's told me
about the club. He was even willing to cut me a deal on the membership fee. I
understand that she's not your favorite person, and that you're not fond of her,
I do."</p>
<p>"She hasn't given us much of a reason to be." Willow's eyes bugged
out. "Does that mean that you're...? And that she could be...? Cordelia?
I'm not saying I'm against it...I'm not...that's wrong and narrow-minded and
stupid...if you are, then that's...great. Really great. Yay for you. I'll still
be your friend and all, don't worry, cause I'd never do...just cause...I've
heard things, read things...I even watched a-a documentary once. It had a little
bunny in the corner." Her babble came to a stop.</p>
<p>"Uh, Will? I don't think that was a documentary."</p>
<p>"It wasn't?" The hacker reddened as it hit her. "Why would my
dad have...?"</p>

<p>"This was...I shouldn't've said anything." Buffy was realizing
that.</p>
<p>Willow frowned. "No...I mean, yes, you should've. You shouldn't keep
secrets, and I'm glad you told me, honest. It's just...a lot, you know? And what
if Cordelia's lying to you? She's the master at manipulating people. She could
be trying to trap you. Then she'll humiliate you..."</p>
<p>"That's crossed my mind, but I don't think she is. And we still like
guys."</p>
<p>"So you're that thing where you like boys and girls?"</p>
<p>"Or I'm just me." Buffy smiled.</p>
<p>"Sorry." Willow smiled back awkwardly. "This is new."</p>

<p>"When we went to the frat house, I got jealous when I saw her dancing
with somebody. I mean, *jealous*. And she got jealous of me when I did. That's
what she said to me after we left, and I knew she was telling the truth. Then
she said that until we decide exactly how far whatever we're feeling goes, we
should stay dateless. She thought of it while we were chained up waiting to be
demon chow. It was a big moment for her."</p>
<p>"That was the idea she was in such a hurry to tell you? That you two
shouldn't date anyone so you won't get jealous?" Willow had to smirk.</p>
<p>"Think about it, Will. Cordelia not having a guy attached to her at the
hip? For her, that's a big deal."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I guess it kinda is." It was starting to sink in. "Wow.
She must be serious."</p>
<p>"She needs to be totally doubtless though, and I get that. If she
decides that she loves me," Hearing the word out loud was strange for both
girls, "that means she pretty much ceases to be popular. On a whole bunch
of levels. It's a hard thing to let go of. I'm as clueless as she is right now,
but loving Cordelia is sounding less and less like a bad thing. Which is why,
until I don't have a doubt, I'm not gonna lead Angel on."</p>

<p>The doorbell rang.</p>
<p>"Oh! That's Xander. Are you ready?" Buffy asked, getting excited.</p>
<p>"Yeah. O-o-okay." Willow was automatically nervous.</p>
<p>"Cool! I can't wait for the boys to go non-verbal when they see
you!"</p>
<p>"Gimmie time, okay, Buffy?" Willow asked. "But I hope that you
and...that it goes whatever way'll make you happy."</p>

<p>The slayer hugged her. "Thanks, Will."</p>
<p>"I'll-I'll be down in a minute."</p>
<p>Buffy walked out, and Willow took a deep breath. Definitely the sheet.</p>
