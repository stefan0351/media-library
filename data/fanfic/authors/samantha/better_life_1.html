<!-- The Better Life \ Chapter 1: Its Not Her Fault That She's So Irresistible -->

<p>Not too long ago in the land of far away Orlando there lived a girl whose
name was Buffy.  She wasn't rich, or by any means special.  She lived in a
doublewide trailer, with her step-mom and stepsisters who all hated her and
treated her like dirt.  This is her story.</p>
<p>"Buffy, turn up the goddamn air conditioning," Buffy awoke to the sound
of her stepmother screaming.</p>
<p>"Yes mom," she reached up above her head to where the controls for the
air-conditioning, heat, ect. all were.  She didn't really have a room, just a
closet big enough for a bed and at the end of the bed a bucket of her
clothes, such as they were.  Her father had died leaving them with very
little money, and despite his requests that she be well taken care of, most
of the money went to her stepsisters.  Her stepmother kept her around like a
maid, to clean, cook, and do laundry.  Buffy got off her bed, opening the
door to the hall, hoping to make it into the bathroom. Almost there her
stepsister pushed by her.</p>
<p>"Oh no you do not.  I know you don't think you're getting a shower before
me."  Cordelia tsked at her then waltzed into the bathroom, slamming the door.</p>
<p>"Yeah and after her I am getting in," her younger stepsister Dawn added
from her bedroom door.  "Why don't you go get breakfast, and pack my
lunch - and no peanut butter that is soooo unbelievably cheap."  She slammed
her door.  Buffy sighed and turned toward the kitchen, she knew that by the
time her sisters were done she would be lucky to have time to brush her
teeth.  Her step mom sat at the table smoking a cigarette and reading the
paper.</p>
<p>"Bout time you got up, I've been sitting here waiting for my coffee, you
know I gotta be at work by eight."</p>
<p>"Yes mom, sorry," Buffy started the coffee maker and set out a bowl of
cereal for each of her sisters, after she poured the coffee she sat down for
her own bowl of cereal.  As she finished Cordelia was just coming into the
kitchen.  Buffy walked back to her room realizing there was no way she was
gonna get a shower before school. She dug through her small pile of clothes
pulling out a pair of jeans that was way too long, and a small pink tank top
that used to be Cordelias, till her boobs got too big for it.  She pulled her
hair back in a ponytail and grabbed her books, setting them in the hallway
she went to brush her teeth quickly, unfortunately it was Friday, school was
one of her favorite times, she hated weekends.  It only meant more time at
home cleaning and getting yelled at, at least at school she had a few moments
of peace.  Buffy grabbed her books and headed for the door.</p>
<p>"You better get your ass straight here after school, you know how much
laundry there is, and all the dishes, and I want you to mop the kitchen," her
stepmother yelled from the table.</p>
<p>"I'll come straight home," Buffy closed the door quietly behind her.  She
had to leave earlier then her sisters cause they got a ride to school with
her stepmother.   They refused to be dropped off with her, so she had to
walk.  It was ok with her really, more time away from them, and it was only
like, oh, 10 blocks to school.</p>
<p>She arrived at the school a few minutes before the bell and went straight
to her locker to get her books for first period.  As she dug through her
locker she idly listened to peoples conversations as they passed by.  Just
the boring usual dribble - who was dating who - who was pregnant - who had
abortions - the usual.  Then a voice caught her attention.</p>
<p>"It is gonna be the most fucking wicked party this year, we are so
going."  Buffy looked up at the girls passing her, in the center of them was
Faith King - the richest most popular girl in school, she was surrounded by the
other girls from the 'royal' families of the city.</p>
<p>"Your dad will never let you go to the party, it is totally a shack party
Faith."  Harmony Lorde chided her.</p>
<p>"Whatever, he wants me to meet a husband so bad he doesn't care where I
find him, as long as it is a him," Faith winked at the girls, and they
giggled, "This party is gonna be wicked."  Buffy watched the girls disappear
down the hall.  Had she just heard right?  Was Faith King into girls?  She
had heard the rumors before, but here from the horse's mouth.  God, she had
had so many fantasies about Faith, quiet ones so, as her stepsisters wouldn't
hear.  She slammed her locker shut.  Not that it mattered if Faith liked
girls she would never like her, Buffy looked down at her pitiful outfit,
Faith had been decked out in Gucci and Prada most likely.  No there was no
chance; she would never be able to go to the party anyway.  Sighing Buffy
headed for class.</p>
