<!-- The Better Life \ Chapter 2: I'm Not Crazy Cause I Take The Right Pills Every Day -->

<p>The fact that Faith King was going to a shack party was a gossip of the
day in all Buffys classes.  The boys were all bragging that they were gonna
show her what she was missing, and the girls saying that they would be with
her for her money, few of them admitting their true interest in her.  Buffy
sat in the back of her classes as usual, just listening, she knew Cordelia,
and Dawn would both be going to the party, while she would be sitting at
home, watching TV, if she was lucky enough to be done with her chores.</p>
<p>She took her time walking home from school, wishing to savor her last few
minutes of freedom before the weekend.  She turned up the gravel path to the
trailer, and opening the door was immediately yelled at.</p>
<p>"Where have you been?  We have been home for five minutes already, what
did you stop to get a soda?" Her step mom yelled.</p>
<p>"I.."</p>
<p>"Never mind, now listen, I want everything clean by the time we get home."</p>
<p>"Where are you going?"  Buffy asked as she started to clear the dishes
from the table.</p>
<p>"Not like it's any of your business, nosy," Dawn said picking up her
purse.</p>
<p>"But we are going to get new outfits for Xander Harris's party, you know
the shack party, where Faith King is going to be tonight.  I hear she buys
her girlfriends all kinds of shit, one girl even got a car."  Cordelia smiled
dreaming of the things Faith would buy her when she seduced her.</p>
<p>"Too bad she isn't gonna like you," Dawn snapped, "Once she sees me."</p>
<p>"Right, cause babysitting is one of her big turn ons," Cordelia rolled
her eyes.</p>
<p>"I'm mature!"</p>
<p>"You're fourteen, you shouldn't even be going to this party."</p>
<p>"That's enough, you are both going, and while I don't like the thought of
either of you playing for 'that' team, it would be worth it for a while, I am
more counting on one of her rich male friends to like one of you."</p>
<p>"Please mom, that is so not where the real money is," Cordelia opened the
door holding for Dawn as they both walked out.  Their mother sighed.</p>
<p>"Now, laundry needs doing, dishes washed, mop the floor, take out the
trash, vacuum the living room, and tidy all the bedrooms, I want this all
done by the time we get home."  Her stepmother was digging through her
pockets trying to find her keys.  Buffy picked them up off the kitchen
counter and brought them to her.</p>
<p>"I'll get it done mother, do you think that, maybe if I got everything
done in time," Buffy, swallowed, getting up the nerve to ask.</p>
<p>"Maybe you could what?"  Her step mom asked snatching the keys from her.</p>
<p>"Maybe go to the party tonight, just for a little while?"  Her stepmother
laughed.</p>
<p>"Absolutely not!  That is out of the question, your sisters are going and
they don't need you embarrassing them, and I have a date tonight so someone
needs to be here to watch the house, what a stupid question."
With that she slammed the door and was gone.  Buffy sad down on the couch,
her arms crossed, she heard the car try to start, and finally start, it
backed out of the driveway, and the noise disappeared.  It wasn't fair, her
sisters didn't even like Faith, they always talked about how stuck up she
was, and how gross it was that she liked girls.  And Buffy really liked her
and she couldn't go to the party.  She stood up and started collecting the
remaining dishes and running the sink water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later that afternoon.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"No dad."</p>
<p>"I am just saying, why not just give it a try, you hardly even gave Gavin a
chance."  Richard King stood in the doorway of his daughters' room; she was
finishing her makeup.</p>
<p>"Dad," Faith turned on her stool to look at her father.  "I am sorry, but I
don't like boys, I mean I look at them and stuff, but they are not for me."</p>
<p>"Just promise you will give them a chance honey."</p>
<p>"Sure I'll give them a chance."</p>
<p>"That's my girl," he walked over kissing her forehead, then leaving the room,
she heard him mumble under his breath as he left.</p>
<p>"Maybe she could find someone at this shack party."  Faith turned back to the
mirror smiling at herself.  She knew her dad would never let her know that he
knew where she was going tonight, but he wanted her to meet a guy
desperately, although he had liked her last girlfriend Willow.  He still had
his dreams of her huge white wedding; she kept telling him that they could
still do that.  He would just shake his head at her.  Oh well the shack
parties were always fun when she was able to go to them, she could always
find some hot, lower class girl, desperate for her money, to fool around
with.  They thought she didn't know their motives, but she did.  The phone
rang.</p>
<p>"Hey hon., it's Harmony, what's up?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, just finishing getting ready.  You going tonight?"</p>
<p>"Duh, of course, would I miss this?  I will see you there though, me and
Gabby Duke, and Miranda Knight are going to a club for a while first.  Who
are you going with?"</p>
<p>"Gavin's supposed to pick me up in about an hour, and we are gonna get
something to eat, then go to the party."</p>
<p>"God, why you still put up with that boy is beyond me, I just hope you don't
expect me to talk to him."</p>
<p>"Never."</p>
<p>"Right, bye for now."</p>
<p>"Bye," Faith hung up the phone, Harmony really was obnoxious sometimes, and
they were mostly only friends because of their parents.  Faith really
believed the only reason she didn't like Gavin was because his family had
only recently come into money, and it pissed her off that someone like that
shared her last name, she constantly was letting people know that they were
NOT related.  But Gavin Lord was one of the only guys that Faith had ever
been even mildly attracted to, now they were really good friends, despite
what her father wished.  At that moment she heard and engine in the driveway. </p>
<p>Taking one last look at herself she grabbed her jacket.  Walking out the
front door she saw her dad walking towards Gavin's Camero, and Gavin stepping
out.  They shook hands; Faith sighed walking up next to Gavin.</p>
<p>"Gavin Lord, always nice to see you around here," her father said smiling
broadly.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. King, you know I love taking your daughter out," Gavin put his arm
around Faiths shoulders, trying not to wince as Faith pinched his other arm.
Her Father smiled even bigger.</p>
<p>"Well yeah, you kids have fun, Faith moved away getting in the passenger side
door, Gavin quickly got in the drivers side, revving up the engine.  He
smiled at Faith, as he put the car in drive, pulling around the circular
drive heading back towards the street.</p>
<p>"Do you know how much he wants up to get together?" She asked. "Why do you
have to encourage him?"</p>
<p>"Cause its fun to watch you squirm, he smiled at him."  It was really too bad
that there wasn't a romance between them Faith thought, not for the first
time.  He was fucking fine.  He was Italian so he had nice dark skin and
eyes, he wore his hair spiked, and today was wearing a pair of baggy jeans,
and a dark blue sweatshirt with a picture of an imp on it, his favorite.  Oh
yeah there was no denying he was a hottie.</p>
<p>"Hello Faith?"  He waved a hand in front of her face.</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"I said where do you wanna eat?  What were you thinking about?"</p>
<p>"Just how cute you are," Faith playfully pinched his cheek.  He smacked her
away, she laughed at him.  "I dunno, how about Olive Garden?"</p>
<p>"Sounds good."</p>
