<!-- A Buffy Christmas Carol \ Story -->

<p>Buffy pulled the mail out of the mailbox and turned towards the house.
She lifted her dark sunglasses on top of her head to read.  Bills, bills,
bills, she thought as she looked through the pile.  Then she came across a
white envelope with reindeer dancing across the front, she smiled, knowing it
was a Christmas card.  Then she frowned as she looked at the return address.</p>

<p>"What the hell?" She said out loud stopping.  "Faith?  Sending me a
Christmas card?"  </p>

<p>   She continued walking into the house and absently put the bills on the
table by the door. She shut the door behind her and walked into the living
room, as she sat on the couch she opened the card, tearing the envelope.  She
opened the card reading the message inside.</p>

<p align=center>"Alright which one of you farted?"</p>

<pre>
Buffy,
    I know the cards dumb, but come on reindeer farting, ha ha.  Ok
sorry, I know you are probably not happy to be getting this letter from
me, I bet you opened it and were like 'what the hell?'.  Don't worry I
am better now, they let me out last month, had lots of therapy, now I am
certifiably uninsane (is that a word?)  So I thought about you a lot while I
was in there, I just wanted to say that I was sorry for everything I have
done to you.  I know I don't deserve your forgiveness, but they say it never
hurts to ask.  So, I am staying with Angel right now, you know how to
reach him.  I was hoping maybe I could see you for Christmas? I mean the
one Christmas I came to your house was one of my best memories… no
pressure…. Get a hold of me.  Thanks…sorry.

    Love,
          Faith
</pre>

<p>Buffy stared at the card rereading it several times.  She wanted forgiveness?
She wanted to come to visit for Christmas?  Damn that girl had some sort of
nerve thinking that she could just send a freaking dumb card and get herself
back on Buffy good side after all the shit she pulled?  Buffy tore up the
card throwing it in the trash.  That was bullshit and she was going to write
Faith back telling her just that.</p>

<p>"Buffy?" Dawn yelled from upstairs.  "That you?"</p>

<p>"Yeah Dawnie, its me.  What's up?"</p>

<p>"Can I stay at Alicia's tonight?"  Dawn asked from the top of the stairs.
Buffy stood up and walked to the bottom of the stairs.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" She asked.</p>

<p>"A friend from school, she is in my Spanish class.  You remember Larry?
She's his little sister."</p>

<p>"Alright, they live on Porter right?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, so I can stay?  Can you give me a ride?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and yes, get your stuff together."</p>

<p>Dawn squealed and ran back into her room, Buffy could hear her bubbling on
the phone to Alicia.  In about ten seconds she was downstairs with a backpack
ready to go.  Buffy smiled and her.</p>

<p>"Remember, if this in any way turns out like Halloween."</p>

<p>"I know I know, grounded for life, no Christmas, blah, blah.  Don't worry, I
will be good, I promise."</p>

<p>"Ok, get a jacket," Dawn grabbed her jacket and Buffy followed her out the
door, together the climbed into the car and drove across town to where Alicia
lived.</p>

<p>Buffy came back to a dark house; Willow and Tara had gone away for the
weekend, so she had the place to herself.  She made cocoa and sat at the
kitchen table to write Faith back.  She thought while she had a few sips of
her drink.  She put the pen to the paper and started to write…</p>

<pre>
Faith,

    You're right.  I didn't want a letter from you, not now and not ever
You hurt me more then anyone I have ever known.  You slept with
two of my boyfriends and tried to kill my mom. (She died if that makes
you feel good, bet it does.) I can not even believe that you would have
the nerve to write me asking for me to forgive you.  And then on top
of that you ask to come visit.  You have some fucking nerve.  I don't
want another letter from you Faith, I don't wanna know one more thing
about your life, or you, just leave me alone.

      Buffy
</pre>

<p>She sat back and reread the letter, didn't wanna make any mistake and look
like an idiot.  She put the letter in an envelope and sealed it, writing the
Angels address on the outside of it.  She rinsed out her mug and turned off
the kitchen light.  She walked to the front door and opening it, set the
letter in the mailbox.  It would go out tomorrow and Faith would know how she
felt.  She watched a little TV and then getting sleepy she turned it off and
walked up to her room.  She brushed her teeth, put on her pj's and crawled
into bed.  She lay staring at the ceiling thinking about Faith and the
letter, why would she write that?  Buffy tossed and turned a little trying to
get comfortable.</p>

<p>She heard a creek from the stairs.  Looking up, she quickly wrote it off to
being house noises.  Then she heard it again.  She sat up in bed grabbing her
stake from under the pillow.  She sat alert listening.  She heard it again,
this time on the landing.  Then a voice.</p>

<p>"Buffy," the voice was right outside her door.  Buffy jumped out of her bed.</p>

<p>"Mom?" She asked, opening the door.  Joyce stood outside the door.  Buffy
couldn't believe her eyes.  It was her mom, a little shimmery, but still her
mom.</p>

<p>"What?  Mom, what's going on?"</p>

<p>"Buffy, I have to tell you something, you are making a mistake not letting
Faith back into your life.  You remember how I was after your father left?"</p>

<p>"Mom, Faith tried to kill you, she is evil."</p>

<p>"Buffy," Joyce sighed.  "People change, trust me.  You are going to have
visitors tonight they will try to help you see, listen to them."</p>

<p>"Visitors?  What are you talking about mom?  Mom?"</p>

<p>Buffy sat up in her bed, alone in the room.</p>

<p>"Fuck, what the hell was that dream.  It felt so real."  Buffy lay back down
and rolled over facing the window.  She watched the moon for a minute before
drifting off.</p>

<p>Buffy woke to a crash downstairs.  Once again she jumped out of her bed,
grabbing her stake.  </p>

<p>"Ok this is not a dream," she mumbled to herself, slowly walking out the door
of her room.  She could see a light downstairs.  Whoever was down there
wasn't being very quiet she could hear cabinets opening and closing as well
as the fridge.  Maybe it was Willow or Tara, Buffy thought.  Coming down the
stairs she turned towards the kitchen.  She could see a man in the kitchen,
fumbling through the cupboards.</p>

<p>"What the hell do you think you're doing?"  Buffy said harshly.  The man
turned around quickly looking at Buffy.  "Oh god, not you again."</p>

<p>"Yeah, it's me girl," Whistler said taking a swig from his bottle.  "And for
a bunch of slightly underage females living alone, you seriously lack
alcohol."  He too another swig from his bottle.  "Luckily I was able to find
this in the back of the cupboard."  He smiled at her.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?"  Buffy asked sighing.</p>

<p>"I my friend, am the so called, ghost of Christmas past.  For you at least."</p>

<p>"The huh?"</p>

<p>"Ghost…of…Christmas…past.  What am I not speaking clearly, I haven't had
that much yet."</p>

<p>"You mean like scrooge, and tiny Tim and all?"  Buffy asked raising her
eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Ding, ding, lets give the girl a prize.  Ok come on cute bit, lets get going
time is money."  He took a hold of Buffys arm leading her towards the back
door.</p>

<p>"You get paid for this?"</p>

<p>"Well not exactly, actually I am paying off something with this, sorta
community service."  As he spoke they walked through the back door and to
Buffys surprise she found herself in her old living room in LA.</p>

<p>"What?  How did we get here?"  She asked looking around.  The room was
decorated with lights around the windows, and a big Christmas tree near the
couch.  Underneath it lay a whole mountain of presents.  Buffy turned hearing
giggles from the hallway.  She saw a younger blonder version of herself
running in, followed by Dawn.  Her mom and dad followed smiling.</p>

<p>"Daddy, dad, dad, dad!  Presents look Santa came!"  Little Buffy screamed
diving to the foot of the tree.</p>

<p>"Buffy, make sure everyone has a present before you start just tearing into
them," her dad said taking a seat on the couch with his wife.</p>

<p>"I know," Buffy looked under the tree finding a present for her mom and dad,
and then Dawn and herself.  Buffy watched as the family opened all the
presents.</p>

<p>"This is your Christmas past," Whistler said touching her elbow gently.  "You
remember?"  Buffy nodded, smiling as little Buffy and Dawn ripped open
present after present.  Little Buffy stuck a bow to her sister's head, and
Dawn did the same to her.</p>

<p>"Ok girls, picture time," her dad said getting up to set up the camera.  He
sat back down on the couch and Dawn climbed up onto his lap and little Buffy
onto her moms.</p>

<p>"One, two, smile!"  Her mom said, and the camera flashed.  With her eyes
readjusting to the light after the flash Buffy found herself no longer I the
house.  She was now in a dingy apartment.</p>

<p>"This isn't my past," she said turning to Whistler.</p>

<p>"Very astute," he turned her back to look at the little Christmas tree.  The
room was dark, except for the lights on the tree.  Then Buffy could hear
fighting.</p>

<p>"Fucking slut," she heard a mans voice, "can't keep your fucking legs
together!"  Buffy heard the unmistakable sound of a fist connecting with
someone's face.</p>

<p>"Maybe I could if you were any good in bed," a woman cried.  There was
another sound of a hit and then crying.  Suddenly the man and woman came into
the room him pulling her by her hair.  "I've had about enough of your shit,"
he threw the woman, causing her to knock over the tree.  Suddenly Buffy was
aware of a little dark haired head poking up over the couch, almost as soon
as she saw the girl, she disappeared. </p>

<p>Time fast-forwarded, Buffy saw the man and woman continue fighting, then him
pass out and her fall asleep crying in the bedroom.  Then it was morning, as
the sun came through the window the small head once again came up, this time
the whole little girl came with it from behind the couch.  She quietly
righted the tree, putting on a few of the sparse ornaments that hadn't broken.</p>

<p>"What is this?  Where are we?"  Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me you can't tell, just look think about it."  Buffy looked hard </p>

<p>around her trying to see if she had been here, then she looked again at the
little girl.  It dawned on her.</p>

<p>"Faith?"</p>

<p>"Right again, this is her Christmas past."  Buffy looked at the little girl.
She slowly opened the few Christmas presents under the tree, being very
quiet, so as not to wake her dad.  There was a worn pair of jeans, a
sweatshirt, a puzzle, and a stuffed rabbit that looked like it had seen
better days.  The little girl smiled opening a box that said 'Love Grandma'
inside were a pair of knitted gloves and a hat.  Buffy didn't know how she
hadn't recognized her.  Even so much younger, Buffy could see all the same
hurt and pain in the girls eyes, even when she smiled.  Going back behind the
couch the girl got dressed to go outside and play.  Coming back out Buffy saw
she was dressed in a pair of jeans much to big for her, a ratty t-shirt, and
jacket, she put on the brand new gloves and hat gently.</p>

<p>Quietly Faith walked to the door opening slowly to minimize the creaking.
She stopped there was a big package outside the door.  Buffy moved closer to
see.  The top of the box read 'To Faith, Love, your watcher' Faith looked
around to see if she could see anyone, but no one was around.  She shrugged
and opened the box.  She pulled out two of the most beautiful dolls Buffy had
ever seen, one with blonde hair and one with dark hair.  Faith just looked at
the dolls in awe.  She turned walking back into the house; Buffy followed her
behind the couch.  Under her makeshift bed Faith lifted up a board and gently
put the blonde doll in.  She took the dark one with her outside.  Buffy
watched from the window as she showed the doll off to some kids.  Time fast
forwarded again….Faith playing…her dad waking up… her dad going outside, her
dad taking the doll, and pulling its head off throwing it away and dragging
Faith inside…..Faith cleaning…..her parents fighting…..her dad storming
out…night coming…Faith in bed.  Buffy watched as Faith quietly pulled the
blonde doll up from the floor hugging it tightly and kissing it, then sliding
it back in.</p>

<p>"It's time to go," Whistler said.  Buffy nodded and the apartment swirled
away from her.  Buffy awoke with a start in her bed.</p>

<p>"What the fuck," she mumbled rolling over and falling back asleep.</p>

<hr>

<p>"God damn it Dawn, it's the middle of the fucking night!"  Buffy yelled without opening her eyes, she just shoved her head under the pillow, the music continued.</p>

<p>"Fucking stupid sister," she mumbled "wait, Dawns at Alicia's."  Buffy sat up in bed, Britney Spears danced at the end of her bed, ass shaking, and looking sultry at Buffy.  The music faded out and she moved to the edge of Buffys bed, sitting down.</p>

<p>"Hey there sleepy, lordy I thought you'd never wake up, do you know you talk in your sleep?"  Britney asked sweetly.</p>

<p>"What the hell?  Wait oh god don't tell me.  Who are you?"  Buffy asked, knowing the answer.</p>

<p>"Well I'm the ghost of Christmas present of course."</p>

<p>"Yeah I thought so, listen this is all just a little too weird, if I could just go back to sleep now."  Buffy lay down.</p>

<p>"Oh no, now I waited here long enough for you, get up," Britney took Buffys arm and pulled her to a sitting position.  Buffy allowed herself to be pulled off the bed so they were standing right next to her bed.</p>

<p>"Right now, hold onto me and shut your eyes," Britney commanded.  Buffy did as she said holding her arm and shutting her eyes.  She felt the air whoosh up around her, her hair flew up with it.  Buffy grabbed onto Britney's hips pulling her closer to stable herself, Britney's hand went to the small of Buffy's back.</p>

<p>"Open your eyes," Britney whispered in her ear.  Buffy opened her eyes to find herself in her own dark living room.</p>

<p>"Ok, not bashing or anything, but Whistler was much more impressive."</p>

<p>"Shhh," Britney said tapping her arm.  Buffy quietly looked around her living room, it looked exactly like it had, Christmas tree at one end by the window, garland on the mantle.  Then she heard someone coming down the stairs.  Watching carefully she saw herself come down, and quietly leave.</p>

<p>"Where am I going?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You'll see, hold on again."  Buffy grabbed tight this time, not at all enjoying the whooshing.  She opened her eyes to find herself in Spike's crypt.</p>

<p>"Oh god, I do not even wanna see this unless I am killing him."</p>

<p>"Watch," Britney said pointing.  Buffy watched the door of the crypt, only to see herself burst through it wrapped in Spikes arms, the lips firmly locked.  She was tearing off his clothes, and he was pulling at hers, she heard her shirt rip and saw him fling it away to the ground.  He pushed her bra out of his way as he mouth moved down her chest to her breasts, she pulled his head to her harder.  He came back up the her face kissing her again as they both made their way to the bed, falling onto it, they proceeded to undress.  "Please, I do not want to see anymore of this, can we please go?"  Buffy pleaded turning away to look at Britney.  Britney looked sympathetically at her.</p>

<p>"This is your Christmas present, after everyone else is in bed, you will be here with him.  Lets go."  Buffy quickly grabbed a hold of her shutting her eyes.  The whooshing was a great relief after what she had seen.  Opening her eyes she found herself in Angels hotel.</p>

<p>"Why are we here?"  She asked.</p>

<p>"To see Faiths Christmas," Britney answered.  Buffy turned around and was aware of Gunn, Cordelia, and Faith playing cards at a table.  Fred sat at the computer.  They all talked laughing, while playing, Fred chimed in occasionally.  There was garland and lights all around the foyer.  Angel came walking in from the other room carrying a pile of letters.</p>

<p>"She wrote you back," he said handing a letter to Faith.  The table went quiet.  Faith took the letter from him gently.  Cordelia laid a comforting hand on her arm.  Faith smiled quickly at her before opening the letter.  Buffy watched as her face fell.</p>

<p>"Not good?"  Angel asked.  Faith shook her head; Buffy could see tears forming in her eyes.</p>

<p>"She doesn't want me to ever try to get a hold of her again."  She took a deep breath, "she thinks I am happy her mom died.  God I fucking loved Joyce."  The tears were flowing freely now.  "Bitch."  Faith threw the letter and her cards onto the table, she pushed back her chair walking towards the door.</p>

<p>"Faith, what are you doing?"  Angel asked.</p>

<p>"I'm going out."</p>

<p>"Are you sure that's a good idea?"  Cordelia asked, standing up.</p>

<p>"No," Faith laughed through her tears, wiping them away.  "But I'm doing it."  With that she walked out the door, slamming it behind her.</p>

<p>"Should we follow her?"  Gunn asked.</p>

<p>"No, let her go, she needs time," Angel said.  "She'll be fine."</p>

<p>"Right, cause she's miss stable," Cordelia said sarcastically, turning and heading up the stairs.</p>

<p>"She cares?"  Buffy said quietly.</p>

<p>"Of course she does," Britney answered.  "Did you actually read her letter? Gosh, why can't ya'll just get over it and move on."</p>

<p>"I didn't know, I just thought she was playing me.  But what do I owe her anyway."  Buffy said defensively.</p>

<p>"Lordy, come one," Britney pulled Buffy to her as the whooshed away.  Buffy opened her eyes to find herself in a dirty dark alley.  She saw a figure stumbling down it to the main road.</p>

<p>"Fucking bitch," the figure mumbled, Buffy realized it was Faith.  She took another swig from the bottle she carried in a brown bag.  "All fucking high in mighty, fucker.  Fuck her, fucker."  She took another big swallow.  "Who needs her," She threw the empty bottle at the wall, Buffy heard it shatter.  "My mom died, happy Christmas Faith, know it just what you wanted, fuck you Buffy Summers.  Fuck you, fuck you, fuck."  Faith tripped over a trashcan losing her balance for a second.  She giggled as she caught herself.  Buffy looked at her in horror.  "Well listen bitch, that just fine, me the fucking virgin bitch, baby Jesus bitch, whatever, what ever."  Faith made a 'W' with her fingers, giggling again.  She reached the mouth of the alley passing Buffy.  "I loved you," Faith mumbled.</p>

<p>Buffy watched as she stumbled past her, she wanted to reach out to her and apologize, but she realized that would be pointless.  She just watched her go, stumbling into the road, still mumbling hateful things to Buffy, not knowing that she could hear ever one of them.</p>

<p>"I don't want to see this either," Buffy said turning to Britney.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry but you brought it on yourself," Britney said looking pained.  Buffy suddenly heard a loud honking, whipping around she saw the headlights of a big truck bearing down on Faith, who stumbled on oblivious.</p>

<p>"Faith!!!!"  Buffy screamed.  All she could see were the lights and then everything went blank.  She was still screaming as she found herself sitting up alone in her bed.  She shut her mouth, but she could still hear the echo of her own voice.</p>

<p>"God, what the hell have I been eating?"  She wondered to herself.  "Britney Spears?  What the fuck is going on."  She lay down not thinking she would ever go back to sleep, but surprisingly fell immediately back into a deep sleep.</p>

<hr>

<p>Buffy opened her eyes, finding herself in a bar.  She looked around, and then down at herself, she was still wearing her pj's.  "Ok this whole thing is getting old," she said quietly.  She started to push her way through the crowd; no one seemed to even notice her.  Then she saw a girl waving from behind the bar; all she could see of her was some amazingly purple hair.  "Fashion statement," Buffy thought weaving her way through the crowd to where the girl was serving drinks.</p>

<p>"Bout time you showed up," she said handing drinks to the guy behind Buffy.</p>

<p>"Well you're not so bad yourself sweetie," he said handing her an extra ten for a tip.  She rolled her eyes at Buffy, before ducking under the bar to come out next to Buffy.  Grabbing Buffys hand she motioned her head toward a door off to the side.  Buffy followed the girl, and soon they were out back in a dark alley.</p>

<p>"Sorry, bout that," she said lighting a cigarette.  "It's just I don't have that much free time, so unlike the other ones you gotta come to me at work.  I know not too convenient, but hey it allows me to do my job, and serve my time," she shrugged.</p>

<p>"Wait, who are you, where am I, how come people can't see me, and you're trying to tell me that all you 'ghosts' are doing this to pay off a debt or something."</p>

<p>"Whoa with the questions," Buffy glared at her.  "Okay, okay.  I'm Taz, nice to meet ya, you are in Vegas, outside the bar I work in, people can't see you because you are sort of the ghost here, just like in the other places the ghosts took you, and we are not paying off a debt, this is sorta like community service, better then doing time.  Any more questions?"</p>

<p>"Just one.  What did Britney do?"  Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Can't really say, but lets just say, you've seen her, a girl doesn't get to look that way without calling on some evil deity.  Now come on, we gotta get going I don't have too much time."  She threw her cigarette to the ground grinding it out with her shoe.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?"  Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"I'm the ghost of Christmas future, so we are going future, close your eyes."  Buffy did as she was told.  "And open them."  Buffy opened her eyes to find herself in a dark graveyard.  She walked along looking at the names on the graves.  She could hear someone crying and was moving towards it.  Two figures came into view, as she got closer she recognized them as Angel and Cordelia.</p>

<p>"I know it's been almost two years but I still can't believe she's gone Angel," Cordelia cried.  "God, if you had only let us go after her it never would have happened."</p>

<p>"You think I don't know that?  I think about that everyday Cordy.  It was a mistake."  Angel answered.</p>

<p>"I know, god, I'm sorry, I shouldn't blame you, it's really Buffys fault.  She was such a bitch to Faith, telling her she was probably happy her mom died.  If she could have just got her head out of her pompous ass for one second, this never would have happened," Cordelia started with fresh tears and turned to Angel, who embraced her, he nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>"Faith was on her way to being a great woman and slayer.  Just one night and it was all gone.  Come on Cordy, its Christmas Eve, let go home, the guys will worry, they know how much you miss her."</p>

<p>Angel and Cordelia turned, his arm still around her, they headed away from Buffy.  Buffy turned to Taz.</p>

<p>"Cordelia is that upset about Faith?"</p>

<p>"She had a whole other life you didn't know about, or give her the chance to explain to you."  Buffy looked down ashamed, when she looked up she was in her living room, at least she thought it was hers it looked like it, but some things were different, a new couch, different table lamps, but she could hear people talking in the next room.  She followed the voices to the dining room, Taz walking behind her.</p>

<p>"It's horrible, I still can't believe it," Xander said, Anya patted his back.</p>

<p>"I know, I miss her, it's sad, and stupid," she said.  Willow and Tara sat across from Anya and Xander, with Giles at one end of the table, and Dawn at the other.</p>

<p>"You always know just what to say honey," Xander patted her hand.</p>

<p>"I know it's like she was here, and then she wasn't.  I didn't even think she was upset or, anything, but its just like, gone, and over, and I miss her," Willow said her voice cracking, Tara put an arm around her, Willow leaned into her.  "Yes, but perhaps it's for the best, she was obviously still deeply upset.  She never called me once in the three years since I've been gone," Giles said.  "If I called and she happened to be in, she would have an excuse to leave in seconds, never returned my calls."</p>

<p>"She looked so peaceful, I thought she was sleeping, she looked…..like she used to, but then there was all the blood…dripping down her wrists, it had pooled on the sheets," Dawn said, not looking up from the table where she was busily tearing up a piece of paper.</p>

<p>"Dawnie," Willow leaned over gentle placing a hand on Dawns arm.</p>

<p>"No, I'm fine.  I mean really, it's not like before, I don't know, I think Giles is right.  She wasn't right here anymore."</p>

<p>"Their right, it's better, a new slayer, someone stronger, ready," Xander said.</p>

<p>"Yeah, better," Willow said quietly.  As Buffy watched they all faded away, the room faded to black and a graveyard came into view, it was night.  "I'm dead aren't I?"  Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Killed yourself babe, way they figure it you waited till everyone was out of the house, and then after a few drinks to fortify yourself you sliced yourself up real nice with The knife the Mayor gave Faith.  Sliced your wrists almost up to your elbows.  Dawn found you when she got home from dinner with some friends, you were dead by the time the ambulance got there, pretty tough on a girl her age," Taz said shaking her head. "You think I don't know how hard it would be for her?"  Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Do you, have you ever really thought about how much she needs you, cause lately I am sure she would tell you it doesn't seem like it."</p>

<p>"Fuck you."</p>

<p>"I just tell the truth, learn to deal."  Taz lead her through the graves before stopping in front of one.  It had a little angel bowing in prayer on the top. Buffy leaned down to read the inscription.</p>

<p align=center>~Buffy Anne Summers~<br>
~Chosen one, she burned quick and bright~<br>
~Born March 15th 1981~<br>
~Drawn to the fire December 24th 2004~</p>

<p>Buffy stood back.  She turned to Taz who shrugged at her.  Hearing something Buffy turned around, she saw Dawn coming through the graveyard to the grave.  She carried flowers and knelt down in front of the grave placing them down.  She sat back on her heels sighing.</p>

<p>"So, this was your big plan?  To fucking kill yourself and leave me all alone.  God I already lost mom, and dad doesn't care, then this?"  Dawn was crying.  "It's fucking ridicules.  I can't believe you were so goddamn selfish.  But you know what fuck you I don't care; it's not like you were ever there for me anymore anyway.  I still have the others."  Dawn stood up turning to leave.</p>

<p>"Hey little girl, need someone to take care of you?"  A mans voice came from behind Buffy, her slayers sense tingled.</p>

<p>"Fuck off," Dawn mumbled turning from the guy.  He ran after her.</p>

<p>"Oh come on sweetie, those are harsh words," he grabbed her spinning her around.  Dawn looked terrified as he vamped out.  She squirmed around trying to get out of his grasp.</p>

<p>"Get off me, no, god, get off!!  I'll scream," she yelled.</p>

<p>"Please do," he said bringing his fangs down to her neck.  She screamed in pain as his fangs punctured her neck.</p>

<p>"NOOOOOOO!!!!  Buffy screamed, running to her.  Taz grabbed her.</p>

<p>"You can't do anything, not here not now," she said, turning Buffy to face her.  "You have to change Buffy, or this is the future, this is what will happen if you don't change, you cannot dwell on the past like you have been.  Move on.  It's all up to you now," Taz started to fade away and blur in Buffys vision, her words echoing.  "Up to you now, up to you."</p>

<p>Buffy jerked awake in her bed, her sheets were soaked with sweat.  She looked around panicky; she looked at her arms, no cuts.  Sunlight was streaming through the windows.  Morning, she pulled the covers back getting out of bed.  She ran down the stairs and out the front door, she opened the mailbox.  The letter was gone.  "Oh god," she moaned.  "So, not fair, she said there was time!" she looked up and down the block, three houses down she saw the mail man, she took off after him, catching up with him in front of the next house.  She pulled his arm spinning him around.</p>

<p>"I need a letter back!"  She yelled at the guy.</p>

<p>"I'm s..sorry," he stuttered.  "Once it's been picked up I can't just give it to a random person on the street."  Buffy pulled his bag off his shoulder rummaging through until she found her letter to Faith.  She flashed the man a big smile.</p>

<p>"Thanks," she turned heading back to the house, once inside she went to the kitchen, and pulling the trashcan out from under the sink started to tear the letter up.</p>

<p>"There's still time," she said going to a drawer and pulling out her address book.  Her fingers scanned down the page.  "Angel…Angel…Angel.. there," she tapped the page after locating the number.  She went to the phone.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Mail here," Angel, said entering the foyer of the hotel.  Cordy, Fred, and Faith sat at a table drinking coffee and eating doughnuts.  Faith stuffed the last of her jelly one into her mouth; she jumped up going to Angel.</p>

<p>"Anything for me?" She asked as she swallowed.  He shook his head looking as her sympathetically.  Faith turned walking back to the table and retaking her seat.  Cordy patted her arm.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, she probably hasn't even gotten the letter yet," Cordy said, Faith smiled up at her.</p>

<p>"Thanks," Faith sighed.  "She isn't gonna want to see me though, you know that."</p>

<p>"Oh come on, from what Angel said she's very forgiving, I mean he went all evil and tried to kill all her friends, her mom, he tortured her watcher.  I mean you only tried to kill her mom, and slept with…" Fred slowly stopped talking as both Angel and Faith glared at her.  "Oh, um wasn't there a computer program you wanted me to look at?"  Fred got up from the table going toward Angel's office.</p>

<p>"She's right Faith, don't worry, give it time," Angel advised.  Faith nodded.  They heard the phone ringing in the office.</p>

<p>"Angel Investigations," Fred answered.  "Yes, just a second, she's here."  Cordy and Faith looked at each other, wondering which one of them was getting the call.  Fred came to the office door.  "Faith, phones for you."  Faith gave Cordy a look of confusion.</p>

<p>"Parole officers not supposed to call for a couple days," she walked past Fred into the office.</p>

<p>"Yeah, hello?"</p>

<p>"Faith?"  Faith slowly sat down in Angels chair, she felt like all the air was knocked out of her.</p>

<p>"B?"</p>

<p>"Hi, I uh got your letter," Buffy said.</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, um I just wanted to say that yeah, I wanna see you, when can you come for Christmas?"  Buffy said quickly.  Faith smiled.</p>

<p>"Next bus out of town count me in."</p>

<p>"Really? Ok well, good so I will see you soon?"  Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Sure, B."</p>

<p>"Good, well I gotta go so I will talk to you when you get here, do you still have my number?  Well yeah you probably do, or if not Angel does, and you are there so you could ask him for it. Or do you just wanna take a cab here cause I mean you know where I live, you sent me a letter…" Buffy rambled, Faith interrupted her smiling.</p>

<p>"I missed you B," the other end of the line was silent for a second.</p>

<p>"I miss you too Faith.  I'll see you soon?"</p>

<p>"Soon," Faith hung up the phone.  She looked up to see three heads leaning in the doorway to the office; all three of them pulled back quickly.  Faith smiled.</p>

<p>"Some privacy guys?"  She asked.</p>

<p>"So, what's going on?"  Cordy asked innocently.</p>

<p>"You know what's going on, she wants me to come."  Faith smiled again.</p>

<p>"See I told you all that stuff didn't matter," Fred smiled warmly at Faith.</p>

<p>"Yeah, ok I gotta pack some stuff, there's a bus out at three right?"</p>

<p>"Yep, straight through to Sunnydale, take food, they won't stop at all, and the seats are this horrible color," Cordy said sipping her coffee.</p>

<p>"Good luck Faith," Angel said, leaning against the counter.</p>

<p>"Thanks," Faith headed upstairs to pack.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Buffy hung up the phone, leaning her head against the wall.  Faith was coming, Faith was coming today.  She sighed.  "Ok, gotta clean, make the guest bed, ok she will be here today," Buffy said trying to calm herself.  The phone rang right next to her ear, Buffy jumped back.  "Fuck," she mumbled.  "Hello?"</p>

<p>"Buffy, can you come pick me up now, its almost noon, you said you would come by eleven," Dawn said.</p>

<p>"Shit, I totally forgot.  Sorry I'll be right over."  Buffy hung up the phone and ran upstairs.  She pulled on a pair of jeans, and a clean purple tank top, ran a brush through her hair.  Going back downstairs she picked the keys up off the table and headed to pick up Dawn.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Buffy honked the horn, she saw Dawn peak through a window, then the front door opened, Dawn hugged Alicia before running to the car.  Alicia waved at Buffy, who waved back.  Dawn got in the car talking a mile a minute about the night before.</p>

<p>"Oh my god Buffy we had so much fun.  Her younger brother is such a dweeb, he was spying on us while we were talking about the guys we liked, but then we got him back, Alicia poured a whole bunch of salt in his soda and then he took a huge sip of it and about puked he spit it everywhere it was hilarious.  And his mom made him clean it up.  Oh my god and then.."</p>

<p>"Dawn."  Buffy interrupted.</p>

<p>"Yeah?"</p>

<p>"Someone's coming to visit for Christmas."</p>

<p>"Oh I know Willow told me all about it, I didn't know you knew I thought it was supposed to be a surprise, but oh well.  You're happy he's coming right?"</p>

<p>"Uh, Dawn, I don't think we are talking about the same person, who is coming, who did Willow invite?"  Dawns face turned white as she realized her mistake.</p>

<p>"Uh, oh, uh, no one never mind, my mistake, I meant.." Dawn stuttered.</p>

<p>"Dawn," Buffy used her best mom voice.</p>

<p>"Don't tell Willow I told and don't be mad ok?  Giles is coming, he gets in tonight.  Are you mad."</p>

<p>"Tonight? And no one told me?"  Buffy yelled.</p>

<p>"Don't be mad!"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not mad, it's ok, but oh we are gonna have a bed problem."</p>

<p>"Wait, who were you talking about?"  Dawn asked.</p>

<p>"Faith is coming," Buffy answered.</p>

<p>"She is?  Oh my god really?"  Dawn squealed.</p>

<p>"Yes, now please stop that noise, you have to help clean."  Buffy turned the car into the driveway.</p>

<p>"Yeah sure no problem, oh my god this is gonna be great," Dawn jumped out of the car racing inside.  When Buffy walked in she could see bags in the living room and heard excited voices from the kitchen, Willow and Tara had obviously just got back.  She went into the kitchen setting her keys down on the counter.  Willow came up to her, a frown on her face.</p>

<p>"Faith's coming?"  She asked.  Buffy matched her frown.</p>

<p>"Giles is coming?"  She asked, then she smiled, hugging Willow.  See Will, secrets are not good they come back at you.</p>

<p>"Are you sure it is a good idea?"  Willow asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, very sure," Buffy said nodding for emphasis.</p>

<p>"Alright, if you know what your doing."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They spent the rest of the afternoon cleaning the entire house; none of them had noticed how slack they had been in the cleaning since Giles left.  The house was in tiptop shape by the time a taxi arrived out front.  Dawn was watching by the window.</p>

<p>"Hey, their here, one of them.. oh its Giles. Giles is here!"  She jumped from the couch where she had been watching and ran to the door throwing it open.  Willow, Tara, and Buffy crowed up behind her.  Giles smiled at them as he wheeled a suitcase up the sidewalk, they moved aside letting him in.</p>

<p>"Hi," Dawn said hugging him tightly.</p>

<p>"Giles!"  Willow squeaked.  "We missed you," she pulled him into a hug.</p>

<p>"Hi," Tara smiled at him.</p>

<p>"How are you?"  Giles smiled at her.</p>

<p>"Good," Tara returned his smile.  He walked past her toward Buffy who stood back from the others.</p>

<p>"Buffy," Giles said.  Buffy pulled him into a tight hug, she felt his arms come up around her.</p>

<p>"I missed you so much," she whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>"Yes, very well, um Buffy, could you, let go a little," Giles said as he could feel the air leaving him.</p>

<p>"Oh sorry," Buffy pulled back a little.  "Sorry I haven't called.  It was just, you know."  Giles smiled at her.</p>

<p>"It's fine.  So what festivities do we have planned for the night?"</p>

<p>"Well, we got the tree and put it up, but it still needs to be decorated, so we will do that, and we have turkey, and Xander and Anya are coming, and Faith," Buffy told Giles.</p>

<p>"Faith?"  He asked sharply.  Willow put a hand on his arm shaking her head.</p>

<p>"No it's ok Will.  She wrote me Giles, she is better I think.  She sounded better on the phone, and she is staying with Angel, he wouldn't let her if she were still the old Faith.  He trusts her, I have to give her another chance."  Giles nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, well then.  You said turkey."</p>

<p>"Yes, turkey, actually we were hoping you could help us, we think we are cooking it right, could you look?"  Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, how I miss this," Giles said smiling in good humor at her.  Just at that minute Xander and Anya opened the door.</p>

<p>"Honey, I'm home," Xander said.  "G-man, you're here!"</p>

<p>"Yes, nice to see you Xander, and you still cannot call me that."  He patted Xanders back in a fatherly way.</p>

<p>"Nice to see you," Anya said.  "You're leave after Christmas right, not taking the store back are you?"</p>

<p>"No need to worry Anya, I don't plan to go near the store."</p>

<p>"Good then, welcome home," Anya patted his back.</p>

<p>"Yes, about the turkey," Giles said.</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah," Buffy lead him off to the kitchen.  The others went to the living room to start getting out the tree decorations.  Once alone Giles turned to Buffy.</p>

<p>"Are you sure about Faith?"  He asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am, this is gonna sound weird but I totally had a Christmas Carol thing last night."</p>

<p>"A Christmas Carol, as in Dickens, it was on TV?"  Giles asked bewildered.</p>

<p>"No, it was here, for me, got the three ghosts and the tour of past, present, and future.  Believe me, having Faith back is the right thing."</p>

<p>"Really, three ghosts?  Odd."</p>

<p>"You're telling me.  Here does it look ok?"  Buffy opened the oven.  The doorbell rang.  Buffy body suddenly shook with nerves.  Why am I nervous, she thought?  Ok breath. "That's her."</p>

<hr>

<p>Buffy beat everyone to the door, but didn't open it for a second, looking back she saw everyone leaning around the corner from the living room.  Dawn motioned her to open the door.  Taking a breath she opened it.  Faith stood outside, she was looking down at the mat, but hearing the door open her eyes raised to meet Buffys.  Buffy felt her breath catch.  Faith looked beautiful.  Her hair hung in dark curls over her shoulders, she wore black leather pants, and a red sparkly tank top was visible under her jacket, she carried only a backpack over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Hey," she said.</p>

<p>"Hey," Buffy answered, still not moving.</p>

<p>"You gonna let me in, or we gonna stand here all night?"  Faith asked a little smile playing on her lips.</p>

<p>"Oh, yeah, um come in, Buffy stepped aside blushing, she blushed even more as Faiths body brushed against her, causing her to shiver.  She hoped Faith hadn't noticed.</p>

<p>"Faith, oh my god, how are you?"  Dawn jumped at her; Faith dropped her bag hugging the girl.</p>

<p>"I'm good Dawnie, damn you grew, almost as pretty as your sister now," Faith winked at Dawn who giggled.</p>

<p>"Almost?  Try way past," she said, receiving a slap on the arm from Buffy.  Giles stepped forward.</p>

<p>"Giles," said Faith nodding.</p>

<p>"Good to see you well Faith," Giles said, both of them knowing what he meant.  She nodded again at him.</p>

<p>"So, we all staying here?"  Faith asked looking at the group.</p>

<p>"Well, me and Tara live here now, and Giles is staying, so all of us but Xander and Anya are staying here tonight, but they will be back nice and early tomorrow for presents," Willow explained.</p>

<p>"Nice, where you want my bags B?"  Faith asked.</p>

<p>"Huh?"  Buffy asked still zoning.</p>

<p>"My bags, where you want them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, come on, we'll be right back down to decorate," Buffy took Faiths hand leading her upstairs.  Faith was surprised by this, but happy, she hadn't expected to find Buffy this warm to her.  She squeezed Buffys hand gently, Buffy looked back down questioningly at her, Faith just smiled, and Buffy returned the smile squeezing her hand slightly.  She led Faith up to her room.</p>

<p>"I'm crashing with you B?"  Faith asked setting down her bag.</p>

<p>"Yeah, well no one told me Giles was coming till today so you know lack of beds," Buffy leaned up against her dresser as Faith, knelt down to take her brush from her bag.  She threw her coat on Buffys bed and turned to look in the mirror as she ran the brush through her hair.  She paused looking at Buffys reflection in the mirror.  Faith couldn't believe how beautiful she had gotten.  She looked sadder that was for sure, but it seemed to only back her all the more appealing.  She wore a pair of tight silver pants, and a black tube top.  Her hair was longer then when Faith had last seen her, and she liked the curls in it.  Buffy caught her eye in the mirror, and smiled at her.  Faith smiled, blushing for being caught, and quickly finished brushing her hair.  She turned and threw her brush on top of her bag.</p>

<p>"Hey, I gotta say this to you right now, ok?"  Faith asked walking over so she stood right in front of Buffy.</p>

<p>"Yeah," Buffy looked up at Faith.</p>

<p>"Thanks for letting me come here.  I mean I know that I really don't deserve to be here."  She took Buffys hands in hers, "I really appreciate it."  Buffy smiled at her.</p>

<p>"It's no problem Faith, I thought about not letting you come, but then I realized that you deserved a second chance, welcome back."  Buffy put her arms around Faiths neck pulling herself up to her.  Faiths arms wound there way around Buffys waist, she breathed in the scent of Buffys hair.</p>

<p>"You still smell like vanilla," she whispered.  Buffy laughed pulling back to look at Faith.  "What?"  Faith asked.</p>

<p>"I was just thinking that you still smell like cinnamon," she said.  Faith smiled at her, tucking a loose strand of hair behind Buffys ear.</p>

<p>"Hey are you guys gonna help at all or what?"  Dawn yelled from downstairs.  Buffy rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, we're coming."  She turned one more time smiling at Faith, then broke out of their hug heading down stairs; Faith shook her head following her down.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They spent the next hour decorating the tree.  Buffy and Dawn got in a tinsel fight, throwing most of it all over the floor, and a surprising amount onto Giles, who grumbled good-naturedly.  Faith smiled happy to be together with them all again.  Dinner was next; they all laughed and ate way too much.  After dinner they sat in the living room talking for a while, neither Dawn nor Giles lasted very long before they decided to go to bed.  Dawn asked Faith to come up and say goodnight to her.  Faith shrugged and left her spot on the couch next to Buffy.  She followed Dawn up to her room, and sat on the edge of her bed.</p>

<p>"Aren't you a little old for bedtime stories," she asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I missed you though Faith." Dawn looked down at the blankets.  "I always was hoping for you to come back, for it to be like it used to be.  No one makes Buffy happy like you Faith."  Faith sat stunned listening to her.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?  Most of the time we fight, you guys make her happy."</p>

<p>"No, I know you fight, but for real, she would always talk about you. And now, well you know she died, she just hasn't been the same, she has been out of it.  She doesn't even ask where I am going half the time.  I hope she is better with you here.  She laughed more tonight then she has in months."  Faith smiled down at Dawn, smoothing down her hair.</p>

<p>"Don't worry kitten, I'll take care of her."  "Oh god, don't call me that baby nickname, I hated it when I was twelve, I'm fifteen now Faith."</p>

<p>"Oh, sorry miss maturity," Faith said standing up, "remind me to get your room ready at the old folks home."</p>

<p>"Night Faith," Dawn said smiling.</p>

<p>"Night," Faith smiled turning off the light, she shut the door quietly.  She stood on the landing for a while thinking about what Dawn had said.  She could hear Christmas carols coming from the living room.</p>

<p>"You coming down?"  Buffy asked?  Faith came out of her daze seeing Buffy at the bottom of the stairs.</p>

<p>"Yeah," she headed down. Buffy stood at the edge of the living room watching the others.  They had turned the lights off so the only light in the room came from the fireplace, and the Christmas tree.  She sensed Faith come up next to her, Buffy turned and smiled at her, before turning back to the room, she felt Faiths arm go around her waist, and her mouth next to her ear.  She was whispering something, but all Buffy was aware of was her warm breath, Buffy turned her head so that all Faiths breath was falling on her lips, they were only centimeters apart.  Buffy felt a chill go through her at the feeling.  She finally understood what people were talking about in books when they described the feeling of someone's breath on their lips.  She knew how close they were and wondered what anyone in the room might be thinking, she didn't care though all she wanted to do was kiss Faith right then, she had no idea why but it seemed like the right thing to do.</p>

<p>"Buffy?"  Faith had pulled back.</p>

<p>"Huh?"  Buffy blushed.</p>

<p>" I said 'don't Xander and Anya ever get sick of the constant groping and flirting?"  Buffy turned to them; they were under the mistletoe, kissing, and then pulling back to whisper to each other.  Buffy smiled.</p>

<p>"No, they don't, soon Anya will ask him if it is orgasm time, and they will leave."  Buffy answered.  Faith laughed.</p>

<p>"Well guys, uh it's getting late, guess we better get going," Xander pretended to yawn.  "Tired, you know?"  Faith stifled a laugh.  After Xander and Anya left, the two Wicca's and the slayers sat talking for a while.  Willow and Tara shared the couch, while Buffy and Faith sat on the loveseat.  Faith was insanely aware of Buffy, who was curled up leaning against Faith, one hand placed on her leg.  Faith tried not to move, so Buffys hand would stay there.  After a while the two witches said goodnight and headed upstairs, the slayers sat talking quietly.</p>

<p>"So, B, you ok?  Cause Dawnie is pretty worried about you."  Faith said.</p>

<p>"She is?"</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"I don't know, I guess I have been out of it.  It was just, big shit with the whole dieing thing, and coming back.  It was hard.  I am trying to be better.  I am glad you're here Faith."</p>

<p>"Me too," Faith smiled at Buffy.  "I really missed you B."</p>

<p>"I missed you too.  I didn't really even realize how much until you got here.  I mean I was mad at you, really mad, and then your letter and on the phone, it was so nice to hear you."  Buffy knew she was rambling but she couldn't stop.  Faith picked up Buffys hand and started playing with her fingers.  "And well then there was you getting here, and it wasn't awkward, I mean it could have been, but it wasn't.  You looked so pretty, and I was just I don't know, blown away."</p>

<p>"You think I looked pretty?"  Faith asked, intertwining her fingers with Buffys.</p>

<p>"Really pretty," Buffy squeezed Faiths hand.</p>

<p>"You look really pretty too.  But you always did."  The Christmas carols ended and the Cds switched automatically.  The next Cd started.  Faith sat listening.</p>

<p>"You listen to Ani, B?"</p>

<p>"Who?" Buffy asked?</p>

<p>"Ani Difranco, this is her," Faith said gesturing toward the CD player.</p>

<p>"Oh, this must be one of Tara's or Willow's."  Buffy said absently, Faith stood up, letting go of Buffys hand.  Buffy looked up at her, and the hand she extended down to her.</p>

<p>"Wanna dance B?"  Faith asked.  Buffy smiled, taking her hand.</p>

<p>"Sure."  Faith lead Buffy out to the middle of the living room, she put her arms around Buffys waist pulling her close, Buffys arms went around Faiths neck and she leaned her head against Faiths shoulder.  Slowly they rocked back and forth listening to the music.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>::::How can I go home with nothing to say</p>

<p>I know your going to look at me that way</p>

<p>And say what did you do out there</p>

<p>What did you decide?</p>

<p>You said you needed time and you had time</p>

<p>You are a china shop and I am a bull</p>

<p>You are really good food and I am full</p>

<p>I guess everything is timing</p>

<p>I guess everything's been said</p>

<p>So I'm coming home with an empty head</p>

<p>You'll say did they love you or what</p>

<p>I'll say they love what I do</p>

<p>The only one who really loves me is you</p>

<p>And you'll say girl did you kick some butt</p>

<p>And I'll say I don't really remember</p>

<p>But my fingers are sore and my voice is too</p>

<p>You'll say it's really good to see you</p>

<p>You'll say I missed you horribly</p>

<p>You'll say let me carry that, give that to me</p>

<p>And you will take the heavy stuff And you will drive the car</p>

<p>And I'll look out the window and make jokes</p>

<p>About the way things are:::</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Buffy tilted her head up looking at Faith, who smiled down at her.  Faith brushed some hair off of Buffys face; she ran her hand through Buffys hair, and down her back, before resting it again on her waist.</p>

<p>"She's good," Buffy said.</p>

<p>"Huh?" Faith asked confused.</p>

<p>"The singer, she's good I like the song."</p>

<p>"Oh yeah, me too, actually it's one of my favorites."</p>

<p>"Faith."</p>

<p>"Yeah B?"</p>

<p>"I love you, I mean, oh god, that wasn't what I was gonna say, oh my god I bet I just sounded really dumb, I was gonna say something else, like um I love your eyes, ok that's still dumb, oh god, I love your lips, fuck.." Faith smiled.</p>

<p>"You mean it B?  You love me?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, I guess I do," Buffy said.</p>

<p>"Good, cause I love you too."</p>

<p>"Oh, well that's good that you love and I love, I am big with the loving."  Buffy was interrupted by Faith lips on hers.  The melted into Faith pressing her whole body up against her, Faith hands were tangled in Buffys hair, her tongue moved across Buffys lips, and Buffy eagerly opened them for her.  She was blown away by the passion of the kiss; it was like nothing she had ever felt.  Faith pulled her lips away, Buffy moved forward slightly trying to recapture them, but with no luck.  Faith rested her forehead against Buffys; Buffy opened her eyes staring into Faiths.</p>

<p>"Is that what you meant B?" Faith smiled teasingly.</p>

<p>"No, but damn, it's what I mean now," Buffy returned her smile.  Faith kissed her again gently on the lips.  The clock started chiming midnight; Faith pulled away breaking their embrace.  Buffy frowned at her.</p>

<p>"What?"  Buffy asked.  Faith smiled.</p>

<p>"Much as I love your pout face, don't worry, this is good."  She reached into her pocket, quit a task due to the tightness of her pants.  "I was sorta hoping, well not that this would happen, this goes so far beyond anything I hoped for, but I hoped we would get along so I got you a present, and being as how it is now Christmas."  Faith held out a little ring, it was a small white pearl, and a small black pearl, set in a thin silver band.</p>

<p>"Oh my god Faith, that is so beautiful, god, that had to cost you so much."</p>

<p>"Yeah, well, no problem, I mean, whatever, come on give me your hand."  Buffy held out a hand to Faith who slipped the ring onto Buffys pinkie.  "There, it's perfect for you B."  Buffy smiled and pulled Faith into a hug, kissing her again.  This time she was the one to pull back resting her forehead on Faiths.</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas Faith."  Buffy smiled</p>

<p>"Merry Christmas B."</p>
