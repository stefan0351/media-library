<!-- Terra Australis Incognito \ Part 7 -->

<p>David watched as Buffy left with Willow, then muttering something
under his breath, he picked up a towel and wiped the sweat off his face.</p>
<p>"What the hell was that?" Xander asked with a touch of anger in his
voice. Although his friendship with the other members of the Scooby Gang was
almost non existent, Xander still felt an obligation to protect them when he
could.</p>
<p>"Look, I'm going to get a drink and then we can sit down and talk.
OK?" David told them. He lead them to the games room where he went behind the
bar.</p>
<p>"Anyone want a drink while I'm here? Orange juice? Tea?" David asked. </p>
<p>Rather distracted, Xander and Giles said no. David grabbed a juice and
went around to sit in the sofa at the other end of the room. He watched as
Giles and Xander looked around the games room in awe. Shifting into serious
mode, Giles sat down opposite David.</p>
<p>"You wanted to explain something?" Giles asked, hoping to get to the
bottom of how David got the ring he gave him the day before. Xander now came
and sat beside Giles, interested in what just happened between him and Buffy.</p>
<p>"OK, to start with, yes I used magic to create those illusions of me
during the fight. Yes I do practice Aboriginal magic and no, that wasn't
Aboriginal magic. That's why I've got this feeling of ickyness and unease
right now." David said with a little shudder. Anytime he used non Aboriginal
magic he was left with a sense of wrongness, it felt dirty. He didn't like
doing it but sometimes he had to.</p>
<p>"OK then, what was the kissing all about?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>"Look, I'm trained to fight. Part of my training is to use the
unexpected to shock my opponent into inactivity for a few seconds so I can
use that time to strike. What's the last thing you expect in a fight? A kiss
would have to be right up there at the top of the list, right? So I kissed
her. I didn't anticipate what happened."</p>
<p>"What happened?" Giles asked.</p>
<p>"Look, the spirit that gives slayers like Buffy their abilities is
called Shelgui. The spirit that gives me my abilities is called Gangui. When
I kissed Buffy these two spirits met and connected for a moment. That's why
it was such an intense kiss.</p>
<p>"I'm not here to seduce Buffy and we are not soulmates, OK? I'm not
here to score with anybody. For some reason Buffy gives me the shits, she
isn't my type."</p>
<p>"What is your type of woman then?" Xander asked sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Well the truth be told I'd say Willow. Red heads float my boat for
some reason." David replied.</p>
<p>"You've got exactly zero chance with her." Xander muttered.</p>
<p>"Xander, I'm here to get some vampire experience and clear up some
family matters. I'm not here to chase chicks."</p>
<p>"What family matters?" Giles asked.</p>
<p>"It is very personal and involves you. I'm happy for Xander to hear
this but are you?" David asked Giles. Giles didn't quite know what to say.</p>
<p>"That's OK, G man. I'll leave you two to talk." Xander said getting up.</p>
<p>"Xander, do us a favour please? Take Spike with you and could you
explain what happened to Buffy. I don't want her getting the wrong idea. OK?"
David asked Xander. Xander nodded and left.</p>
<p>When Giles and David were alone, Giles pulled out the ring.</p>
<p>"Where did you get this?" Giles asked.</p>
<p>"Just before she left London, my mother became pregnant, although she
didn't know this until she got back to Australia. That ring was given to my
mother by my father." It took Giles a few moments to grasp the implication of
what David said. Giles was speechless. Tears formed in both of their eyes.
The two embraced.</p>
<p>"G'day Dad, I'm home."</p>
