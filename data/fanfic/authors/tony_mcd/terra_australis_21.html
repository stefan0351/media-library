<!-- Terra Australis Incognito \ Part 21 -->

<p>They all sat in the lounge room, trying to come to grips with what had
happened. Buffy and Willow bombarded Xander with questions at such a rate
that he couldn't answer the few questions that he could. Giles looked at
David who was still in shock.</p>

<p>"David, what is this War Of The Six all about?" Giles asked gently.
David came out of his shock and shook his head as if to clear it.</p>

<p>"Uh, I need to talk to you Dad. In the library. Now." David said
getting up. Xander looked at David.</p>

<p>"Where are you off to now?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"To the library to talk to Dad. In the mean time I recommend you talk
to these two." David said indicating to Buffy and Willow. David and Giles
disappeared into the library.</p>

<p>"So, Xander. What exactly happened with you when you went to see the
Dreamtime Spirits?" Willow asked her friend. Xander thought for a moment
before responding.</p>

<p>"I saw... I saw you, and Buffy, and Miss Calendar. It was at this
beautiful waterhole. And you and Buffy were little. Like 7 or 8 years old.
Jenny gave me the magic for that vision I showed you and the memory thing.
You guys gave me a present each too. Here." Xander said as he dug around his
pocket to retrieve the items. He held the three leaf clover and the black
opal.</p>

<p>"Willow, you gave me this opal. You told me to keep it because I'd
need it some day. And Buffy you gave me this clover." Xander told them.</p>

<p>"Great, Willow gives you precious stones and I give you grass." Buffy
mumbled. Willow smiled at Buffy's comment before continuing on.</p>

<p>"Was there anything else, any clues to what we are up against?" asked
Willow.</p>

<p>"No. That was all that happened." lied Xander. Until he figured out a
few things he wouldn't tell the two girls the rest.</p>

<p>Willow could tell that Xander was holding something back, but she
didn't push it for the moment. For now she was happy to have her best friend
back. They all just sat and contemplated. Xander gave a little chuckle.</p>

<p>"What?" Buffy asked him.</p>

<p>"It's just this memory thing. I remember everything. Every class,
every math text book, every lesson I ever sat through. And you know what?" he
asked them.</p>

<p>"What?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"I'm really pissed that this had to happen AFTER my SAT's." They all
laughed at the thought.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>While the other three were talking in the lounge, David and Giles were
deep in conversation.</p>

<p>"Ok. Explain this War Of The Six. I haven't come across this in any of
my books." Giles told David.</p>

<p>"Of course it's not in any of your books. It's not in any book.
Writing has been around for what? 8 or 10 thousand years. This prophecy is 10
times older than that. Six people, The Chosen One and 5 others to protect
her, will fight a vampire army. If they loose then hell comes to earth. The
War Of The Six marks the beginning of turmoil in the forces of good and evil
and of humanity. At the end of the turmoil there is to be a final battle. The
battle to decide who shall rule the earth, good or evil. But this will only
occur if the War Of The Six is won by good.</p>

<p>"From what we saw it looks like, the War Of The Six takes place here
in Sunnydale. That hill looks like the one I took Xander to."</p>

<p>"The eclipse!" Giles raced to a book shelf and started to leaf through
an almanac.</p>

<p>"When is the next eclipse due?" David asked his father. Giles looked
up from the book.</p>

<p>"Six weeks. The next total solar eclipse in Sunnydale is in six
weeks." Giles informed his son gravely. David exhaled. They had a little bit
of time to organise.</p>

<p>"Ok. So we know that in six weeks, Murg Dor will unleash an army for
vampires to open the gates of hell by killing the Chosen One, who will be
protected by 5 others. The question is who is the Chosen One?" David asked.</p>

<p>"I think it would be safe to assume that Buffy is the Chosen One."
Giles said.</p>

<p>"Ok. Buffy is the Chosen One. I take that Willow, Xander and you will
fight with her. I'll be there, so that leaves us with needing one other
person. Who?" David and Giles thought for a while. Giles had a thought.</p>

<p>"What about Spike? He has fought for Buffy." Giles put forward. David
shook his head.</p>

<p>"No. Murg Dor can control demons and vampires, remember? No. It needs
to be a person. Skilled at fighting. Strong." David grew silent. A thought
slowly entered his head.</p>

<p>"I'll talk to Albert." David said. Giles looked at David incredulously.</p>

<p>"You can't be serious. Fine, Albert has got powerful magic but the man
is 100 for heavens sake!" Giles told him.</p>

<p>"No! I don't mean for him to fight. I need him to try to convince the
Watcher's Council to send us the other Slayer."</p>
