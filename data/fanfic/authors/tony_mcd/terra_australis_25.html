<!-- Terra Australis Incognito \ Part 25 -->

<p>There was a chorus of out cries at the judgement from the General
Council. They were here to listen to the Slayer's request, not to witness her
death. The Chief Watcher called for silence. Buffy stood defiant before the
High Council.</p>

<p>"What makes you think that you can stop me from walking out of here?"
she said, her voice low and dead serious. The Chief Watcher made a motion
with his hand and a young Watcher produced a pistol. Instantly there was a
flurry of motion which revealed Xander pointing a machine pistol at the young
Watcher. Xander was all business. His protective instincts towards Buffy and
Giles coupled with his training, meant that any wrong movement on the young
Watcher's part would be instantly fatal.</p>

<p>The General Council was shocked at the production of guns into the
meeting. David strolled up to the table where the High Council sat. He gave
them a smile that reminded Buffy of the cruel smile that Angelus gave when he
was enjoying a really bad moment. Without taking his eyes off the High
Council, he spoke.</p>

<p>"Albert, I'm guessing you would like to say a few words right about
now. Why don't you share them with us?" David said. The old man stood, his
eyes burning with anger at the High Council.</p>

<p>"I bring the Slayer here in order for her to ask for our help.
Instead, you already dismiss her request out of hand and then put a death
sentence on her and her Watcher..." the Chief Watcher leapt to his feet and
interrupted.</p>

<p>"He is no longer her Watcher!" the Chief Watcher said firmly.</p>

<p>"She is the Slayer and he is her Watcher!" Albert said defiantly.</p>

<p>"Shut up and sit down you ignorant black savage!" the Chief Watcher
yelled at the old man. A hand grabbed the Chief Watcher by the throat and
lifted him clear of the table. It was David.</p>

<p>The look that David gave the Chief Watcher was truly terrifying. No
overt displays of anger, just a look that was cold, hard and frighteningly
calm. It was clear to all that the Chief Watcher's life was a hairs breadth
away from being violently ended. David would kill the Chief Watcher with
little more compunction than stepping on a bug.</p>

<p>"Apologise to Albert. Or else." David said in a monotone voice. There
was no need to explain the 'or else'.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry." The Chief Watcher choked out as David slowly cut off his
air. David released the man.</p>

<p>"Good. Now there will be no punishment of the Slayer or her Watcher.
While she and I don't like each other much, I have the deepest respect for
her and realise how vital she is to this world. As for her Watcher, well, him
being my father should be explanation enough. Now, Albert, I believe you were
saying something before you were rudely interrupted." said David. Albert
stood before the General Council and addressed them.</p>

<p>"A Slayers' duty is to fight the forces of evil and slay vampires. A
Watchers' duty is to train her, guide her and aid her in the performance of
her sacred duty. The Watchers Council has a duty to train, aid and monitor
the Watcher in his duty. What we have seen here today is a demonstration of
this Councils' betrayal of its' duties. The High Council sacked her Watcher
for trying to stop an old fashioned and barbaric test. It then brings her and
her Watcher in under false pretences to kill them. To kill the Slayer.</p>

<p>"I have studied the Watchers Diaries of 416 Watchers and their
Slayers. Of those 416, the average life span of the Slayer is 18. 137 Slayers
have faced apocalyptic events. All were successful at adverting the
apocalypse but only 10 survived the battle. Of those 10, 2 have faced two or
more apocalyptic events. Buffy Summers is the only surviving one of them.</p>

<p>"Buffy Summers is the most successful Slayer in recorded history. What
makes her different? She is stronger physically than most other Slayers, but
not massively so. Is it the support she has received from the Council? Most
certainly not. What is it then? I say it is the support she receives from her
Watcher and her friends. The love, the care, the reassurance that she will
never go into battle alone. That is what makes her different. That is what
makes her so successful." Albert said to the General Council. They hung on
his every word.</p>

<p>"This Council, this Watchers Council, has the attitude that the Slayer
works for the Council. In reality, the Council should work for the Slayer.
Things have changed over the centuries. No longer are Slayers illiterate
peasant girls of the dark ages. The are highly educated, wise to the modern
world, and demanding of a life as normal as is possible.</p>

<p>"This Council, this Watchers Council, has failed in its duties to the
Slayer. I propose the formation of a new council, The Slayers Council, a
council mindful of its duties and able to adapt to today's modern world."
Albert looked about the stunned Watchers.</p>

<p>"Who will stand with me, who will stand behind the Slayer?" he asked
them. Silence. Then the figure of Sam Zabuto stood and walked up to Buffy. He
gently put his hand on the Slayers shoulder.</p>

<p>"I lost my Slayer, my Kendra, in the fight against vampires. I trained
her in the manner of which the Council dictated. I held myself above her
emotional needs and attempted to remove her emotions, lest they make her
weak. I was wrong. My mistake cost her, her life. A few days after I was told
of her death, I realised just how much she meant to me. But it was too late.
She never knew how I felt. She was like a daughter to me. I know that many
Watchers feel that way about their Slayers, but usually it is only after her
death do they realise it." Sam Zabuto looked at Buffy, a sad but determined
look on his face.</p>

<p>"I stand with you, Slayer. For you, for future generations of Slayers,
for my Kendra." said Sam. Buffy smiled at the Watcher, grateful at his
support. She too had fond memories of Kendra and the bond that they shared.
She then looked around at the General Council.</p>

<p>One by one, then in small groups, Watchers took their place behind
Buffy and Giles. In the end, over half of the General Council stood with her.
The vast majority of them were Watchers from outside England. Giles smiled a
triumphant smile.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen" he said to a shocked High Council "with no further
business, this meeting is closed." said Giles and turned for the doors.</p>

<p>"Just one more thing." David said, reaching into his jacket and
pulling out a piece of paper.</p>

<p>"This is an agreement between the Australian, US, British, and other
major governments which guarantees protection and aid to the Slayer and her
associates. It reads 'any interference or threat to the Slayer or her
associates by any individuals or groups shall be deemed by all nations as a
threat to national and international security, and as such, it shall be dealt
with accordingly'." David put the paper away. "I would think about that
gentlemen if I were you." David said to the High Council.</p>

<p>He then turned and with Albert, Buffy and Giles, lead the new Slayers
Council out of the manor. Once everyone was out, Willow summed up the whole
event.</p>

<p>"Holy shit!"</p>
