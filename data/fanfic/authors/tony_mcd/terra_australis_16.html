<!-- Terra Australis Incognito \ Part 16 -->

<p>Xander looked at David.</p>

<p>"What do you mean 'we'? Why am I coming with you?" Xander said.</p>

<p>"I need another person to be there in order to do this. I can't contact
the Deamtime Spirits by myself." informed David.</p>

<p>"Ok, but why me?" asked Xander.</p>

<p>"I can't take Willow or Buffy for reasons that will be clear when you
come with me tonight. I also want to give you the chance to find out your
purpose in life. I want you to talk to the Dreamtime Spirits and maybe they
can give you some idea of a direction in your life. I really think that it
would do you a world of good." David told him.</p>

<p>Xander began to object but stopped. *Maybe he's right. I guess a sense of
purpose would be nice. I got nothing to loose.* Xander thought.</p>

<p>"Is it dangerous?" Willow asked David, afraid for Xander's safety.</p>

<p>"Dangerous? Willow, I've saved my best friend from death, had a all an
out and out fight with a witch and her Slayer lover, helped reverse a
destructive spell, and killed an evil demon who killed dozens of heavily
armed soldiers and kicked me through a window. On the scale of things, this
is the least dangerous thing I'll do all week." smiled David.</p>

<p>"Can I talk to Xander alone please?" David asked the gang. They all got
up and left, leaving Xander and David alone.</p>

<p>"What do you want to talk about?" Xander inquired.</p>

<p>"Do you believe in fate and destiny?" David asked.</p>

<p>"Hello. Bestfriends with the Slayer, you know, 'The Chosen One'?"</p>

<p>"OK. Stupid question." David said with a smile. "You want to hear my
views on fate and destiny?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, sure. Go ahead."</p>

<p>"I think life is kind of like a big city and your own life is like
driving through it. You have free choice generally to go in almost any
direction you choose. Left, right, straight ahead, whatever. The roads you
choose are up to you. Sometimes the choices you make lead you into situations
where you have no choice. Like being in the right hand lane and the sign says
'right hand lane must turn right'. Then you have fate. It's kind of like
being at a certain place at a certain time, no matter what you do or where
you go. How you react to fate largely determines your destiny.</p>

<p>"Destiny is just that; the destination. The end of your journey. No one
knows their destiny.</p>

<p>"Then sometimes you have a legacy. A legacy is kind of like someone
coming to their destiny and leaving you rough directions on how to finish the
rest of the journey. It influences people that come after you.</p>

<p>"When you see the Dreamtime Spirits, remember that they can give you
guidence, sometimes tell you of fate, but never of destiny. Fate is not the
same as destiny."</p>

<p>"All right then. When do we go see the Dreamtime Spirits?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"We'll leave at 11 tonight. There is a place a couple of miles out of
town that would be perfect."</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence.</p>

<p>"Xander?"</p>

<p>"Yeah David?"</p>

<p>"Whatever is attacking you guys is my fate. I can feel it." David's voice
grew small and distant.</p>

<p>"I've also got the feeling that it is also my destiny." whispered David.</p>
