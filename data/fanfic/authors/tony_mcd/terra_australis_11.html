<!-- Terra Australis Incognito \ Part 11 -->

<p>A naked Buffy laid down next to a naked Willow. She marvelled at the
witches perfect skin and ran her fingers through her red hair. They kissed,
and as they did so, Buffy knew that this was going to be the best sex of her
entire life. Buffy rolled over and pinned Willow down beneath. Buffy laid a
trail of kisses down Willow's stomach.</p>

<p>SMASH!</p>

<p>The door flew open to reveal David. It was instantly clear that he was
pissed off to epic proportions. He entered the room.</p>

<p>"YOU FUCKING BITCHES!!" David roared.</p>

<p>Buffy for her part was mega pissed at David for bursting in like this
and ruining the moment between her and Willow. She leapt up and attacked
David.</p>

<p>She kicked him in the head twice and let rip with a good half dozen
punches for good measure. However it was no good as David, furious and with
magic flowing through his veins, just took the pounding and smiled. He
unleashed a hail of punches and ended with a roundhouse kick to the head
which sent Buffy flying.</p>

<p>Willow watched as David pounded on her lover. Her anger boiling,
Willow summoned up her magic and sent the TV flying at David's head. David's
head snapped round as the TV approached it. He held out his hand as if he was
stopping traffic. The TV stopped in mid air. He closed his hand and the TV
imploded as if a giant hand had crushed it. A flick of his wrist sent an
invisible force slamming into Willow, sending her crashing into the wall
beside Buffy, who was now up.</p>

<p>Buffy launched herself at David, still a little stunned but even more
angry than before. She went to axe kick him. David blocked the kick and
punched Buffy in the groin. Pain exploded in her, he doubled over and held
herself. David grabbed her head and kneed her in the face. Then, still
holding her head, he head butted her and threw her at Willow.</p>

<p>"This ends now!" He told the two girls who were laying on the floor.
He knelt down and placed a hand on each of their heads. He closed his eyes
and opened the lock he had on the pain he had absorbed from Xander.</p>

<p>Pain. All the world was pain. The beating Buffy took was mere physical
pain. This was an assault on the heart and soul. Images of Buffy and Willow
flowed through their minds. The pain, the soul destroying pain inflicted on
Xander crashed over Buffy and Willow like giant waves at the beach. All the
feelings Xander had ever kept bottled up now made the girls howl like
tormented demons.</p>

<p>As he channelled Xander's pain into Buffy and Willow, David became
aware of something being fed back to him from the two girls. It was a tone, a
musical note. Clear, pure, heavenly. Powerful. He stopped channelling.</p>

<p>Looking at Buffy and Willow curled up and tormented with grief, David
felt a little sorry for them. His anger gone, he wondered at the tone he had
heard. He left the room, closing the door as best he could before heading to
Xander's place. He was going to move Xander's stuff into a room at his place.
To start the healing process, Xander needed to get out of his parents
basement.</p>
