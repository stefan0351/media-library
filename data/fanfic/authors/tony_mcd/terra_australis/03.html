<p>The next morning, Xander and David were going over their part in the
plan for the War Of The Six. Giles, Willow, and the Slayers Council were
working together on the magic aspect of the war while Buffy was helping the
Slayers Council set it self up in a way that was best for Slayers.</p>

<p>Giles was returning in the afternoon from LA, having picked up some
needed supplies from a rare magic shop. Xander and David were siting in the
library while Buffy and Willow had disappeared about an hour ago in the gym.
David had finished showing Xander his plan for the battle.</p>

<p>"Interesting." Xander said thoughtfully. "But I think there is a
better way."</p>

<p>"What? How? Show me." David said, a little taken back. Xander had good
military training, thanks to his Halloween costume, but David wasn't sure
that it covered battle planning or strategy.</p>

<p>"OK. This is an idea. First... " Xander laid out his own plan. David
listened then tried to find some fatal flaw in Xander's plan. There was none.</p>

<p>"Xander, you are a dead set genius. How did you come up with this? Why
didn't I think of this?" David asked.</p>

<p>"Different training, different experience. Your army are masters at
small unit, hard hitting, mobile warfare. No one does it better. But this
situation calls for massive fire power and brute force. And nobody does it
better than Uncle Sam." Xander explained to an impressed David.</p>

<p>"OK Stormin' Norman, I'll arrange to get the gear that you need for
this dog and pony show of yours. What exactly do you need?"</p>

<p>"First, I'll need as many H&K GMG 2000's as you can get your hands on.
Next I'll... " Xander's voice trailed off as he started to look strange. He
shuddered, and rolled his eyes. David looked at Xander, worried.</p>

<p>"Mate, what's wrong?" David asked.</p>

<p>"Oh God! Nothing. Nothing is wrong at all. Oh boy!" Xander said
strangely and then moaned. It wasn't a moan of pain, it was a moan of sheer
pleasure. David wondered for a bit. Sure, battle planning and discussion of
tactics gave him intellectual pleasure but wasn't something give a man a full
blown happy, which was exactly what was happening to Xander right before his
eyes. It took a moment for David to realise what was happening.</p>

<p>Since they became Trinity, Xander, Buffy, and Willow had displayed an
empathetic connection. They could sense each others moods and feelings, even
when separated. The reason for Xander's current behaviour was probably due to
the activities of Buffy and Willow. David rolled his eyes in frustration.</p>

<p>"BUFFY! WILLOW! CAN YOU PLEASE CUT THAT SHIT OUT! I'M TRYING TO TALK
TO XANDER DOWN HERE!" David yelled at the top of his lungs. Xander continued
to writhe in happiness.</p>

<p>"I SAID CUT THAT SHIT OUT! I'M TRYING TO TALK TO XANDER!" David
bellowed in frustration. Nothing. It was getting down right uncomfortable
watching Xander.</p>

<p>"ALL RIGHT, YOU ASKED FOR IT!" David yelled then went over to Xander
and kicked him in the shin.</p>

<p>"OW!!" Xander yelped and grabbed his leg. Faintly, David heard a
similar cry of pain come from the two girls. Xander looked at David in
annoyance. David merely shrugged.</p>

<p>"Sorry about that mate, but I did ask them to stop."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Their days were spent in preparation for the War Of The Six. The last
few days before the war, David and Xander spent their time preparing their
position on the hill top in accordance with Xander's plan. The morning of the
war Buffy, Willow, Xander, Giles and David surveyed the battle field.</p>

<p>Willow and Giles had gone to the battle field earlier to try and
determine exactly where Murg Dor and his vampire army would appear. Together
they had discovered a front of mystical energy which they believed to be
where Murg Dor would come from. Using this information, Xander was able to
orientate his battle plan.</p>

<p>The land around the hill was cleared for almost a mile, providing a
clear field of fire. Belts of Claymore mines and thermite mines were set up,
ready to decimate the vampires. </p>

<p>Near the top of the hill four pits had been dug and a H & K GMG 2000
had been emplaced in each. The H&K GMG (or Grenade Machine Gun) fired 40mm
incendiary grenades designed to burst in the air and toast any thing with in
2 or 3 yards. They were fitted with an experimental automatic target finder
and were autonomous. Capable of firing at 350 rounds a minute, they had
enough ammunition to last out the eclipse.</p>

<p>At the top of the hill a pit had been dug and this was where they
would fight from. Several MAG 58 machine guns with Match Head rounds were
there for personal use by the group. Willow and Giles were their magic team.
Together they would detect any spell that Murg Dor cast and then counter it.
They also had quite a number of other spells provided from the Slayers
Council to use on Murg Dor and the vampire army.</p>

<p>Should any vampire get into the pit where Buffy and the rest of them
were, then the next defensive measure would be activated. It consisted of a
sprinkler system which sprayed Holy Water in the pit. Everyone had crosses
and stakes as a last ditch measure.</p>

<p>The idea was not to wipe out the vampire army, it was rather to slow
them down long enough for the eclipse to end and the sun to reappear. The sun
would turn the vampires to ashes and Murg Dor would lose. The critical thing
was that as the Chosen One, Buffy needed to survive until the sun came out
from behind the moon. Everything else was not important, including Buffy's
friends.</p>

<p>They all stood in the pit, surveying the surrounding land. Each was in
quiet contemplation of the up coming battle. Buffy looked at her watch in
anger and then rounded on David.</p>

<p>"OK, Captain Kangaroo. It's only a few minutes before this eclipse
starts and there is no sign of your friend, you know, number six? As in the
sixth person to make up this War Of The Six. There are only 5 people here."
she said accusingly at David. David had a calm, almost resigned look on his
face. Perhaps there was even a hint of sadness.</p>

<p>"They are here. We have our six." he said.</p>

<p>"WHERE? HAVE YOU BROUGHT SOME INVISIBLE MAN? YOU ARE SO FULL OF SHIT!"
Buffy screamed at David.</p>

<p>"You want to know who the sixth person is? Fine! Six people are to
fight an army of vampires to save the world. A Chosen One and five others to
protect her. Well, you as the Chosen One, Buffy, have 5 people to protect
you. Xander, me, Dad, Willow and..." David paused for a moment. "... and
Willow's unborn child." Everyone stood looking at David in stunned silence.
Buffy snapped and grabbed David by his shirt.</p>

<p>"WILLOW'S PREGNANT?" Buffy yelled at David.</p>

<p>"I'm not! I mean I can't! I haven't had, well you know, with a guy
since Oz left! That was almost a year ago! I can't be pregnant!" Willow
babbled. A light bulb went over Giles' head.</p>

<p>"Warrior of Light, Guardian in White, Witch of Flame, will be bond.
And then the bond will be formed with blood. The child is from the bond."
said Giles.</p>

<p>"What?" Buffy and Willow asked at the same time.</p>

<p>"The moment you three had your soul combined, that must have been when
the child was conceived." Giles said a little stunned. Buffy looked at David,
anger burning in her eyes.</p>

<p>"You knew! You knew for weeks but you didn't tell us!" Buffy roughly
shook David. "Why didn't you tell us?" she yelled at David.</p>

<p>"You want to know why?" David said angrily, and shoved Buffy away from
him. "I couldn't tell you. I was not allowed! There are shit tins of stuff
that I know but I couldn't tell you. Some things must happen and if you knew
then they wouldn't happen the way they should, even the things I don't like
or want! You think I like knowing things and not being able to say anything?
Things that are so important and impact on the lives of friends and family?
No one does, but I had to do what I had to do. Like it or not." He looked up
into the sky and saw the moon passing in front of the sun.</p>

<p>"It's almost time. Everyone take your positions." instructed David.
Everyone moved to their spots. Buffy glared at David.</p>

<p>"Buffy, if you want to discuss this more, then wait until this is
over, OK?" Giles told his Slayer. They stood there, waiting. The only sound
was the light breeze that blew across the hill. Giles gave a small chuckle.</p>

<p>"What?" David asked.</p>

<p>"Today is Saint Crispin's day, isn't it?" Giles asked his son. David
shrugged.</p>

<p>"I dunno, maybe." David replied. Giles gave another chuckle and turned
to face everyone. Standing before them, Giles saw his children. He felt great
pride at them, and greater love. He stood there, a sense of nobility of what
they were about to do radiated from Giles. In a deep and regal voice Giles
spoke to his children.</p>

<p>"We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;<br>
For today that sheds his blood with me<br>
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,<br>
This day shall gentle his condition;<br>
And the gentlemen in England now a-bed<br>
Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,<br>
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks<br>
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The smiles and looks from the group said it all. They were ready.
Looking out on the battle field they saw a white mist form in a line a few
hundred yards away. Silence gripped the hill. The mist became thicker and
more brilliant. It became a solid wall of white light. Then, as darkness fell
over the land, heralding the start of the eclipse, an immense sound came form
the white wall of light. It sounded as if God had torn the sky asunder. David
cried out at the top of his lungs.</p>

<p>"CRY 'HAVOC' AND LET SLIP THE DOGS OF WAR!"</p>

<p align=right><a class=link href="#top">Top</a></p>

<table cellspacing=0 width=100%>
<tr><td class=h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 29</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Vampires. Hundreds of vampires pouring out of the white light. The
first wave of vampires hit the mines and were decimated in blast and flame.
But for each vampire that was taken out two more surged up the hill towards
them. The GMG's opened up and, along with the fire from Buffy, Xander and
David, further decimated their numbers.</p>

<p>Behind them, Giles and Willow started to cast spells from the book
that they had compiled. They transformed the ground into a bog like quagmire
to slow the vampires. They sent fire balls into their midst, they sent
confusion and fear into the minds of the vampires. But regardless of what
spell was cast it would be countered by Murg Dor who would cast his own
spells which Willow and Giles countered as well. The mass of demons drew
closer.</p>

<p>Looking at the rate that the vampires advanced, Xander saw that the
vampires would eventually get to the hill top, but not before the sun
reappeared. The vampires were a little over 200 yards away when a number
stopped. They raised their bows and the sky became thick with arrows. Arrows
landed all around their position, forcing Giles and David to take cover as
they lacked the magical protection of the others.</p>

<p>"Xander! For fuck sake, take out those archers!" David yelled above
the roar of battle. Xander poured fire at the archers who exploded into flame
as the Match Head rounds hit. The hail of arrows began to diminish.</p>

<p>The sound of the GMG's diminished and Xander swore.</p>

<p>"Shit! Two of the GMG's have stopped firing!" Xander told David who
looked up at the battle field. Sure enough two GMG's had stopped firing. Now
it was David's turn to swear.</p>

<p>"Oh fuck!" he said and looked at Buffy and Xander. Buffy was machine
like as she dealt mechanised death to the vampires. Her face hard, her jaw
set determinedly as she replaced the barrel of her weapon, reloaded and
continued killing.</p>

<p>"I'm going to have to try to fix them." David told Xander. With two
GMG's down the rate of the vampires advance increased. If the GMG's were not
brought back on line then the mass of vampires would reach them before the
sun reappeared. David yelled to Xander and Buffy.</p>

<p>"Cover me!" and then David climbed out of the pit and ran towards the
GMG's. David reached the first GMG as a group of vampires managed to break
clear of the mines and raced toward the summit where Buffy stood. David saw
that the GMG had jammed and he raced to clear the jam before more vampires
came through the break.</p>

<p>They saw the group of vampires which broke clear and sent fire and
bullets into their numbers. Despite nearly wiping the group of vamps out,
several vampires made it into the pit.</p>

<p>"Giles! The spray!" Buffy yelled as she pulled out her stake and
started fighting the vamps. Giles hit the switch that started the spray of
holy water inside the pit. The vampires roared in pain and tried to climb out
of the pit but Buffy dusted them.</p>

<p>David yanked the action of the GMG and the weapon began to fire again.
He then headed to the other weapon. As he approached it a second group of
vampires was trying to follow the first group to the pit. David sent Spirit
Fire at them, turning them to ash and creating a wall of fire that
temporarily blocked the way.</p>

<p>Once David got to the second GMG he saw the reason for it stopping. A
random arrow had torn out the control wiring between the automatic aiming
system and the gun. It couldn't be fixed before the vampires reached Buffy.
Swearing as only a soldier can, David switched the weapon to manual and began
sweeping the vampires with fire. The vampire army began to crumble under the
sustained fire.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Murg Dor saw that his army would not be able to reach the humans
before the sun reappeared. Murg tried to slow time to allow his vampires time
to kill the humans but it was countered but magic from the summit. The
reduction of fire after the GMG's stopped gave Murg renewed hope which was
dashed when they resumed firing. With only a minute or two before the sun
came out from behind the moon, Murg Dor had one final chance to kill the
Chosen One. Himself.</p>

<p>Buffy and the gang saw a figure advance toward them. Seemingly
impervious to the mines and rounds sent it way, the group gasped in horror as
they realised that it was none other than Murg Dor.</p>

<p>Murg Dor was similar in appearance to the Jachyra but was more
powerfully built and a sickly green colour. An air of pure evil radiated from
him, his black eyes seemingly sucked the light into them.</p>

<p>David jumped out of the GMG pit and put himself between Buffy and Murg
Dor. With a yell, David sent Spirit Fire at Murg Dor who roared as it burnt
his green scaly flesh. Murg Dor advanced onto David and slashed at the man
before him. With a wet ripping sound, Murg Dor flung David aside like a rag
doll.</p>

<p>"NO!!!" Giles yelled as he saw what had happened and in blind rage he
attacked Murg Dor. Murg picked Giles up and threw him back into the pit,
breaking Xander's knee and impaling Giles through the hip with a section of
pipe. Murg Dor clambered into the pit.
</p>

<p>Xander could do nothing but watch as Murg entered the pit. Willow
stood between Murg and Buffy as she gathered her magic to fight Murg Dor. She
let lose a barrage of magic but Murg Dor used his own magic to shield himself
from it.</p>

<p>Seeing the uneven fight, Xander began to weep. It wasn't fair. Just
when they had finally found happiness. Despair filled Xander.</p>

<p>Then something flashed through his mind. The opal that Willow gave him
in the Dreamtime! Xander dug his hand into his pocket and pulled out the
opal. It throbbed with energy. As he held it, the situation became clear.
David and Giles were wrong! Buffy wasn't the Chosen One that Murg Dor needed
to kill, Willow's child was!</p>

<p>Ignoring the pain of his shattered knee, Xander limped up behind Murg
Dor and with an inhuman yell, buried his hand with the opal in it deep inside
Murg Dor. Magic flowed through Xander and exploded out of the opal. With a
final wail, Murg Dor disintegrated under the force of the white light which
burned through him.</p>

<p>The magic flowed through Xander unabated as he sent it into the
vampires which had come so near. White fire reduced dozens to ashes as it
chased the now fleeing vampires down the hill. The magic stopped only when
the sun reappeared from behind the moon, reducing the remaining vampires to
ashes. Xander's legs gave way and he fell on the ground which had been fused
into a green glass beneath his feet from the magic. Buffy and Willow removed
Giles from the pipe and helped Xander and Giles out of the pit and to David.</p>

<p>David lay on the ground which was soaked with his blood. He was nearly
torn in half from Murg Dor's attack. He slowly blinked at them as Giles
openly wept and cradled David's head in his arms. Xander sat beside his
friend.</p>

<p>"Don't cry Dad." David said weakly to his father.</p>

<p>"You can't die! You can't die now!" Giles cried.</p>

<p>"Journey's end." David told Giles. Xander looked at David shocked.</p>

<p>"You knew! You knew that you were going to die!" Xander said
accusingly. David slowly nodded.</p>

<p>"No one can escape their destiny. Mine was revealed to me when I went
to the Dreamtime." David coughed up blood. "Dulce decorum est pro patria
mori." </p>

<p>Xander looked up at Buffy. There was tears in her eyes as she cried at
what had happened. Although she and David didn't get along, she knew how
important he was to Giles and she respected the sacrifice that David had
made. She saw him in a new light as she realised that they had much in
common. Both destined to fight evil and to one day die in the fight. Both had
their death prophesied, but Buffy had Xander to bring her back. No one could
bring David back. David looked up at Giles with child like eyes full of fear.</p>

<p>"Dad."</p>

<p>"Yes son."</p>

<p>"Take me home."</p>

<p>Buffy could only watch as a grieving father held his dead son in his
arms.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Xander looked out across the lights as they were reflected off the
water. The beauty of Sydney harbour at night was lost on him as he reflected
upon the loss of his friend. They had buried David with full military
honours. Publicly, David died of an animal attack while on holiday in the
United States but the truth was known by the small number of people involved
with the new Slayers Council. His thoughts were interrupted by a knock on his
hotel door. Opening it, Xander received a shock.</p>

<p>"Spike! What the hell are you doing here?" Xander said. Spike walked
in and shoved a bag at Xander.</p>

<p>"David said to make sure that you got this." the vampire said. Xander
opened the bag to find a leather bound book and a letter. Tearing open the
letter, Xander began to read.</p>

<p><i>Xander,<br>
I'm giving this to Spike to give to you as I won't be able to do it myself. I
need to tell you a few things which are quite important.</i></p>

<p><i>First off, in defeating Murg Dor, you have sealed the Hellmouth for many
years to come. Murg Dor drew much of his energy from the Hellmouth and in
defeating him, the power drain will render the Hellmouth dormant and unable
to be opened for quite some time.</i></p>

<p><i>Second, I ask that you, Buffy, Willow and Dad help train my unit to fight
vampires and demons. I have spoken to the government and it is agreed that
you will have full control on how they are to be trained and used. I've also
spoken to Albert about getting the Slayers Council involved as well. Please
do this. I want my home land to be safe again.</i></p>

<p><i>Thirdly, look after your child. She is important to the future of the battle
between good and evil. I have written a book regarding what I have been told
of the future. I don't understand much of it but you will be able to make
more sense of it when the time is closer. In that same vein, hang on to the
black opal as somehow it is important in the future.</i></p>

<p><i>Finally, look after Dad for me. This will be hard on him but he will have to
get on with his life. Don't say anything to him but he is very attracted to
Buffy's mum. Maybe you guys can help things along in that direction.
Tell him that I love him.</i></p>

<p><i>Farewell.</i></p>

<p><i>Your friend,<br>
David.</i></p>

<p>Xander looked up at Spike. The vampire smirked at him.</p>

<p>"You know it's a real pity that he's dead. I rather enjoyed how he
used to annoy the Slayer." Spike said and turned to leave.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" Xander asked. Spike looked back.</p>

<p>"I'll be around. Enjoy your book." he said and left.</p>

<p>Xander picked up the leather bound book and opened it up. On the front
page was the name of the book that David had written.</p>

<p>Terra Australis Incognito. The Unknown South Land.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>5 Years later.</p>

<p>They sat in banana chairs on the white sand of Captain's Beach. On the
horizon was the entrance to Jervis Bay and Bowen Island which provided
shelter to the beach they sat on. Beyond that lay the Tasman Sea. Buffy,
Willow and Xander watched as their daughter played in the sand.</p>

<p>A young boy of about 4 went up to their daughter.</p>

<p>"Hello." he said.</p>

<p>"Hello." she said back.</p>

<p>"You want to see something cool?" he asked.</p>

<p>"OK." she replied. The boy opened his hand to reveal a tiny white sand
crab no bigger than an adult thumb nail. She was amazed at the little crab.</p>

<p>"Can I touch it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Sure." he said. She touched it but the little crab nipped her finger.
She gave a short squeal of fright and jerked her hand back. The little boy
threw the crab into the water and looked at her with concern in his big brown
eyes.</p>

<p>"Are you OK?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It bit me on the finger, look!" she said and held her finger out for
him to see where it had nipped her. The little boy took her hand to have a
closer look.</p>

<p>Buffy, Willow and Xander looked on in utter shock when their eyes
flashed white. A mist every colour of the rainbow lifted from them and
twisted together in a slow dance. They fused together in a flash of white
light and disappeared. The little boy smiled at the little girl.</p>

<p>"My name's Paul." he told her.</p>

<p>"I'm Jenny." she said to Paul. They giggled and then hand in hand,
Paul and Trinity's Child ran down the beach together in search of adventure.</p>
