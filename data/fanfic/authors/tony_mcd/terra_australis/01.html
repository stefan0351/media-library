<p>He sat on the rocky outcropping over looking the vast empty outback that
he called home. It was only 8 am but it was already 30 degrees C and
climbing. He didn't notice the heat, for he was born here. As was his father,
and his grandfather, and his father before him. Indeed his family and his
people stretched back 100 000 years if the latest evidence was to be believed.</p>
<p>He was considered to be an old man by those who knew him. By their
standards he was. In a few short months he would mark 100 years since his
birth but his body was that of a man half his age. No doubt due to the
ancient magic which flowed through him. </p>
<p>He had dedicated his life to preserving his peoples culture, stories, and
magic. He became a repository for much that was ancient. He was determined
that the knowledge he had acquired would be passed on for future generations.
But for that to happen there had to be a future for the coming generations to
live in. And so began his involvement with the Watchers Council.</p>
<p>His thoughts were interrupted by a familiar presence.</p>
<p>"G'day David" the old man said without turning to face the young man.</p>
<p>"Hello old man. Am I interrupting anything?" David asked.</p>
<p>"No. Come sit with me so we can talk."</p>
<p>David sat beside the old man. The rock was hot but David paid no
attention to it. While he had not been born here, he had grown up here, cared
for by the old man who sat beside him. The old man was not his father but
David had come to see him as such. As for David's real father, the old man
had never told him who it was.</p>
<p>"So, Albert. What thoughts are going through your wizened old head?"
David asked.</p>
<p>Albert smiled at the young man's gentle jibe. The years he spent with the
Watchers Council had made Albert appreciate the unique Australian outlook and
humour. Few places could you call someone a bastard and it be taken as a sign
of genuine affection.</p>
<p>"I was thinking about my birthday." Albert informed David.</p>
<p>"You are not that bloody old!" David exclaimed. He could tell that Albert
was worried about his age. "OK you're 100 soon but that is nothing." </p>
<p>Albert looked at the young man with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Over 100 years before your birth the British landed here in 1788.
Aboriginals arrived here 100 000 years ago. Not too far to the west of here
is the 3.5 billion year old fossil of the earliest life. Not to mention most
of the rock around here is over 4 billion years old. So when you look at it
you are just a baby compared to all of that. Try not to worry about it."
David told him. Albert shrugged and sensed the young mans purpose in coming
to him.</p>
<p>"Where are you going this time?" Albert asked.</p>
<p>"America." David told him.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"It is supposed to be a secret but since it ties in with you, kind of,
I'll tell you." </p>
<p>Albert looked at the young man with a little surprise. David's job as an
officer in one of the world's most elite units, the Australian Special Air
Service, did not generally tie in with Albert at all. The Australian Army
didn't deal with magic.</p>
<p>"I got a call from Canberra telling me I had a meeting with the Prime
Minister. I got there and the PM and the Defence Minister were there. They
told me that there was a problem with vampires being on the rise. Hey, did
you know that the Defence Minister witnessed a vampire attack ten years ago
and that the PM's father was a Watcher?"</p>
<p>Albert nodded "I didn't know about the Defence Minister but the Prime
Minister I knew about. I knew his father. He was a fool just like so many
others on the Council."</p>
<p>"But you're on the Council." David pointed out. Albert looked at David
with an expression that said 'and your point being?'. The two stared at each
other for a moment before bursting out laughing.</p>
<p>"OK" Albert said after they had stopped laughing "what has this got to do
with you going to America?"</p>
<p>"Apparently the Yanks set up some special forces unit to handle vampires
and demons. Unfortunately the Initiative, that's what they called these
blokes, didn't just kill the demons. No, they went and captured them for
experiments. So  surprise, surprise; the demons get loose and the shit hits
the fan.</p>
<p>"So the PM wants me to go over there and study their experiences. See
what toys and tactics they used. Only this time we don't capture the
vampires, we kill them. And I get to form a team that will do it when I get
back."</p>
<p>"Where exactly in America are you going?" Albert asked, his mind racing.</p>
<p>"Sunnydale, California. Why? What's the problem?" David asked seeing the
expression on Albert's face.</p>
<p>"The Slayer" Albert breathed "The Slayer".</p>

<p>"The Slayer? What has she got to do with this?" David asked.</p>
<p>"It is a long story and I need to give you the background to it all. Some
of it you would have already been told. Some, you won't. Let's just say that
it is important enough for you to shut up and listen until I finish." Albert
grumped at David. David for his part was all ears. Albert began.</p>
<p>"We Aboriginals have creation stories like any other people. For us the
World was created by the Great Creation Spirit, the Rainbow Serpent. She
created the world and all living things, shaped the land and made it fit for
people to live on. She also created spirits who were to protect the land and
guide the people. Each spirit had a particular role, be it a sky spirit to
bring rain or a guiding spirit to lead people in the way that least harmed
the land. The Rainbow Serpent also gave free will to people and her spirits
to chose the path that they would follow.</p>
<p>"This free will enabled people and spirits to chose good or evil. Some
spirits decided that they would not serve the Rainbow Spirit who was now
sleeping to regain her strength after creating the world. Some spirits wanted
people to serve them, rather than the other way round. Some wanted to destroy
the world and reshape it as they saw fit. Others had their own agenda.</p>
<p>"So there was 2 camps of spirits, one good and one evil. And since good
was not really into fighting, evil dominated the world. The only thing that
stopped evil from destroying the world was the fact that evil was busy
fighting itself to determine who would rule. </p>
<p>"In the mean time good had decided that if they didn't get organised and
fight evil then evil would destroy them all. So the good spirits came
together and from which a number of spirits decided to become warriors for
good with the others providing what help they could.</p>
<p>"Eventually, after many great battles, good gained the upper hand over
evil. Good, however, lacked the power to destroy all evil. So they used what
power they had to lock as much of evil away from the world as possible. As
evil was removed one fed on a human and mixed his blood with the mans' blood.
That person fed on another human and mixed their blood together. Thus were
born vampires.</p>
<p>"The Rainbow Serpent awoke and saw the destruction wrought by evil. She
saw that vampires could very well mean the end of humans. She also saw that
evil will try to escape its prison. So, before she left the world, the
Rainbow Serpent created two warrior spirits to be placed in a man and a
woman. These two spirits would give the person that they were in great
strength, speed, and healing ability.</p>
<p>"The female spirit, Shelgui, would hunt vampires. When she died, the
spirit would goto another girl and continue the fight. She would become known
as the Slayer. The male spirit, Gangui, would enter a baby the moment it was
born. It would grow with the boy and become a powerful warrior. His destiny
was to prevent evil from destroying the world. Once the man was killed,
Gangui, would wait until he was next needed. Gangui is currently in you
David. Don't ask me why because I don't know, all I know is what I'm telling
you." Albert said anticipating David's inevitable question.</p>
<p>"Now we fast forward to the early 70's. I was in London, after having
been finally accepted into the Watchers Council. I wasn't a Watcher as such
as I didn't train a Slayer. Partly because I was already to old, partly
because I wasn't a born Watcher, and partly because there has never been a
Slayer born in Australia, as you know." David just nodded. He knew the
reasons well.</p>
<p>"I met this wayward character; hate-the-world, played rough, practiced
magic for self pleasure or gain. For some reason we became good friends. He
was rebelling against his destiny, he left Oxford and was doing anything to
avoid his destiny.</p>
<p>"You see his father was a Watcher, as was his father before him. He was
destined to become a Watcher and he rebelled against it. We were quite an odd
pair. He was fighting so hard to avoid becoming a Watcher and I had fought so
hard to become one.</p>
<p>"Anyway he was seeing a girl, my brother's grandaughter, who was over
there for a year on a working holiday. They ended up going their separate
ways when she went back to Australia. He later did a fooling and fatal thing.
He stopped rebelling and I helped him come to terms with what he did. I used
what influence I had to get him back into Oxford and for him to be trained as
a Watcher.</p>
<p>"My grand niece discovered she was pregnant to this lad when she returned
to Australia. She had a difficult labour and died not to long after giving
birth to a healthy baby boy.</p>
<p>"A few years ago the Slayer was drowned by a Master Vampire. She was
revived and she dusted the Master Vampire that did it. However, since she had
died another Slayer was called. Now there are two Slayers. The original who
died and another. From what I can tell, when the original Slayer died,
Shelgui moved onto the next girl but when the original Slayer was revived
Shelgui re-entered the original Slayer and left behind a daughter spirit. </p>
<p>"On her 18th birthday the Council did it's stupid test. She passed but
her Watcher was sacked for having a father's love for her. She then turned
around and told the Council to go fuck itself. She still slays and her
Watcher still guides and trains her.</p>
<p>"They are in Sunnydale. The original Slayer is Buffy Summers. Her Watcher
is the young man I met in London. He gave this ring to your mother before she
left." Albert held up a ring with a snake pattern on the outside. David
gasped.</p>
<p>"You mean..."</p>
<p>"Yes David. That man, the Slayer's Watcher, Rupert Giles, is your father."</p>

<p>Spring in Sunnydale, thought Buffy, normally a time to be happy. The long
dark winter nights were over, warm sunny days, new life emerging. And a time
for romance. At that last thought Buffy frowned. The path of romance had been
rocky to say the least for Buffy and her friends. She sighed as she recounted
how each had gotten to their current state.</p>
<p>After the disaster of Parker, Buffy had all but given up on romance. Then
came Riley who ignited the old lusty feelings again. All seemed to go well,
even after she found out about Riley and the Initiative. However it became
apparent that it could not work out. The events of last year leading up to
the death of Oz had turned Buffy against Riley. She both disliked and
distrusted him. Then there was the matter of lusty feelings Buffy had for a
certain friend.</p>
<p>Xander 'can't win for losing guy' had had a very rough trip down lovers
lane. Miss French ( the Praying Mantis Lady), Ampata (the life sucking Inca
mummy), Cordelia (what was he thinking?), and finally Anya. Having become
mortal, she discovered sex and Xander. At first it was purely physical but
Xander began to fall in love with her. It was at this point that Anya decided
to explore sex with other men and left in search of the perfect orgasm (or
something like that). Xander now spent a lot of time listening to country
music (the music of soul destroying pain he once told Buffy).</p>
<p>Then there was Willow. Buffy's bestfriend was no better off then the rest
of the Scooby gang. First Oz slept with another werewolf, which was bad
enough without the fact that it was Willow who discovered the two naked in
Oz's cage. After killing Verruca (and nearly Willow as well) Oz left.
Heartbroken Willow found someone else to love. The fact that it was a big
breasted, blond wicca by the name Tara threw Buffy (not to mention Xander).
Unfortunately it was not meant to be and once again Willow was heart broken.</p>
<p>Then Oz returned to ask Willow for forgiveness. The bright spark that
should have lit Willow's life was snuffed out. ADAM experimented with magic
and raised the First Evil which promptly destroyed him. The gang were now
fighting for the world (again). Riley had it in for Oz and gave him a faulty
tasar gun for the battle. The First Evil attacked Oz and, despite his own
dislike for Oz, Xander tried to save Oz. He couldn't and Oz was killed as was
very nearly Xander. Xander hovered between this world and the next for ten
long days. The strain was devastating on Willow.</p>
<p>Buffy shook her head in an effort to remove the thoughts from her mind. A
good hard run on the track field, followed by a quick shower and some slayage
should do the trick, she thought. Exercise and killing big honking evil was a
slayers comfort food.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Once at the track Buffy started to stretch and look around. That's when
she noticed the battle going on in the centre.</p>
<p>It wasn't a battle in the strictest sense of the word. A group of about
20 or so guys were playing some form of game. It took a little while but
Buffy deduced that it was some kind of football game with no rules other than
destroy the player with the ball. The players were punching and kicking the
ball around, tackling, and smashing into each other.</p>
<p>Then one of the players managed to pick up the ball and kicked it. It was
a big kick, huge in fact. A small knot of players at the far end of the field
jostled for position to catch the ball, all the while keeping their eyes on
the ball. One set of eyes, Buffy noticed, belonged to Riley.</p>
<p>His bulky frame ensured that he would be in position to catch the ball.
Then at the last moment, a player leapt up and, kneeling on Riley's shoulders
caught the ball some 5 or 6 feet above Riley's head. Both Riley and the
jumper crashed to earth with a bone crunching thud.</p>
<p>"Wow! Did you see that?" Willow exclaimed, startling the slayer.</p>
<p>"Willow! Scare me to death! What are you doing here? I thought you had an
essay to write." Buffy said.</p>
<p>"It's finished so I decided to come look for you. Say, isn't that Riley
over there? I think I might turn him into a toad. How about it Buff?"</p>
<p>Buffy looked at Riley who was slowly and painfully getting up of the
ground. The guy who jumped him was racing down the field, bouncing the ball
and showing no effect of the fall.</p>
<p>"No, I think he is in enough pain as it is. Can I take a raincheck?"
Buffy turned to Willow. "You know what I need? A holiday. A week or two with
no vampires or demons or Hellmouth. Just laying down on a beach, catching
some rays, no world in peril."</p>
<p>"Well you know what they say, a change is as good as a holiday." Buffy
just glared at Willow. "Or maybe not. What do 'they' know anyway?" Willow
added quickly.</p>
<p>Buffy turned to see Riley talking to the guy who had jumped him. She
heard Riley tell him "OK, dawn at the cemetery. See you then." Riley then
limped towards the locker room.</p>
<p>Buffy's eyes narrowed somewhat. Riley, at the cemetery, at dawn. What
ever it was it can't be any good, she thought to herself.</p>
<p>"Willow, how about you and me go to the cemetery, say around dawn, just
for a change?"</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>In the pre dawn light Buffy and Willow patrolled the cemetery. "What ever
Riley is up to it can't be good." She whispered to herself for the tenth time.</p>
<p>"What ever it is Buffy, it can't be vampires. Sunrise is only a few
minutes away." Willow told her friend. It was at this point that they saw
them. In the war cemetery was 6 or 7 figures gathered around a headstone with
candles. They appeared to be chanting or reciting something. The Slayer and
her friend crouched behind the low hedge that surrounded the war cemetery.
Buffy strained to hear what they were saying.</p>
<p>"...grow not old...not weary...condemn...going down of the sun...we
will..."</p>
<p>"What are they saying Buff?" Willow whispered. Buffy said nothing but
placed her fingers on Willow's lips to silence her as she tried to use her
Slayer hearing to listen it on what was being said. It was no use as what
ever it was had ended. Buffy recognised Riley and the guy that jumped him
from yesterdays game.</p>
<p>"See you later Riley." The jumper guy said it an accent she couldn't
quite pick. Still watching them depart Buffy said to Willow "OK I think
they're gone. We should go tell Giles what..." Buffy had turned to face
Willow and saw that she still had her fingers over Willow's lips. Willow was
looking at Buffy with an expression that Buffy had not seen before.</p>
<p>Thoughts flashed through the Slayers mind (lusty feelings for Willow! Bad
Buffy! Bad Buffy!). Willow kissed Buffy's fingers. The world seemed to
contract until there was just the two of them. Buffy closed her eyes as
sparks shot down her fingers and ran down her spine. Buffy sighed and  began
to moan.</p>
<p>Just then a dog started to bark and the two leapt to their feet ready for
an attack. But there was no attack and the pair began breathing again. Willow
looked startled and began to stutter.</p>
<p>"I...I'm...s...so s...sorry...B...Buffy..." The Slayer looked at her
friend and grabbed her hands.</p>
<p>"Don't be sorry. I really liked it and..." Buffy looked down at her feet
and then back at her friend, a coy look on her face. "...and it's too early
to see Giles just yet. Let's go back to the dorm and.." the coy look was gone
and a look of sheer lust replaced it. "...maybe you can help wash my back?
What do you say, Will?"</p>
<p>Willow said nothing, she was unable to. Her fantasy was coming true. She
just nodded and let Buffy lead her out of the cemetery.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>It was just before noon when Buffy and Willow got to Giles place. Buffy
knocked. "Come in Buffy! I'm in the kitchen!" Giles called from inside. On
entering they saw Xander lying on the couch with and ice pack on his head and
a decidedly ill look on his face.</p>
<p>"Xander! Don't tell me you've been cursed with syphilis again." Buffy
remarked.</p>
<p>"He hasn't been cursed by anything." Giles said as he entered the lounge
room. "Good morning Buffy, Willow." he said.</p>
<p>"Young Xander made a big mistake and tried to out drink an Aussie at the
bar last night. Came in here at 2 in the morning singing something about
tying a kangaroo down and passed out in the bath." Spike said from the
kitchen. "Not a pretty picture this morning are you?" he asked Xander.</p>
<p>"It feels like the Hellmouth has opened in my head and all the demons are
having one big party. Buff, please slay me." Xander implored his friend.</p>
<p>Buffy knew the hell Xander was going through. After the bad beer
incident, Buffy had a hangover that measured on the Richter Scale. "You'll
live Xander, although I'm not sure you will want to." Buffy told him. She
turned to Giles. "You'd think he would have learned about the evils of
drinking by now?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yes quite." Giles said. "I'm sorry but what brings you here? Something
you encountered last night?" Buffy told Giles about what had happened last
night; except for the bit with Willow.</p>
<p>"Fascinating, you can't remember anything else about this mysterious
jumper can you? Something unusual?" Giles asked. Something about the ceremony
was familiar but he couldn't put his finger on it.</p>
<p>"Um, no. Wait, yes. He had a strange accent. British or something." Buffy
told her Watcher.</p>
<p>"Hey! Never call an Aussie a Pom. It's very insulting." A voice from the
doorway said. Everyone turned and Buffy recognised him as the jumper. Buffy
leapt up ready to attack.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" Buffy demanded. "What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>The man ignored her. "Rupert Giles? I'm David McWray, Albert Nameria told
me to come and see you." Giles was surprised, thinking back to his old friend
and the last time they spoke. Albert was one of the few on the Council who
had defended him and still spoke to him.</p>
<p>"Who the hell are ..." the man cut off Buffy's tirade.</p>
<p>"Chill out Slayer Barbie, all will be explained in good time." he said in
a calm, even voice. He reached into his pocket and threw something to Giles.</p>
<p>"Albert said you might be interested in that."</p>
<p>Giles looked at the object. It was a set of dog tags on a metal chain and
a ring with a snake pattern on the outside. Giles' eyes went wide.</p>
<p>"Where did you get this? Giles gasped.</p>
<p>"We'll talk about that another time." the man said.</p>
<p>Buffy was by now quite angry at being ignored like that. "Giles! What in
God's name is.." Giles cut her off.</p>
<p>"Buffy! For heavens sake! Sit down and be quiet!" Giles snapped. Buffy
reluctantly sat down. Xander looked surprised.</p>
<p>"Hey, you're that Aussie that got me drunk last night!"</p>
<p>Giles shook his head to clear his thoughts. "Uh.. please come in and sit
down Mr.."</p>
<p>The Aussie laughed "Please call me David." he said.</p>
<p>"OK. David. Would you like a cup of tea?" Giles asked David.</p>
<p>"Yes thanks, I'd love a cuppa." David said as he sat beside Xander. Giles
went back into the kitchen.</p>
<p>"OK, you've got some explaining to do. First off I saw you playing some
kind of game with Riley, acting all buddy-buddy with him. Then this morning I
saw both of you at the war cemetery doing some kind of magic ritual. Now I
find out that you got Xander very drunk last night and you got told to see
Giles by someone. What is going on?" Buffy hissed at David.</p>
<p>"That game you saw us playing was called Aussie Rules and..."</p>
<p>"Didn't look like there were too many rules out there." Willow chipped
in. David continued.</p>
<p>"...and I was playing with Riley and some of his friends and some
backpackers from Melbourne.</p>
<p>"That so called magic ritual you saw this morning; today is April 25,
which in Australia is ANZAC Day. We remember those that have fallen in war,
kind of like your Memorial Day. It is traditional to hold the service at
dawn..." Buffy cut him off.</p>
<p>"What about that incantation thing?" she asked.</p>
<p>"What incantation thing?" David asked, some what annoyed at being cut off
continually.</p>
<p>"You know. Not growing old, condemning, going down of the sun?"</p>
<p>David looked at Buffy with an expression remarkably similar to the one
that Giles gave her when she really began to annoy Giles.</p>
<p>"They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old. Age shall not
weary them, nor the years condemn." At this point Xander joined in with
David. "At the going down of the sun, and in the morning, we will remember
them." There was a sombre pause. "Lest we forget."</p>
<p>"Xander, how did you know that?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"I remembered it from when I was army guy." he said. Something clicked in
his head.</p>
<p>"Hey. On that chain you gave to Giles. There was a set of dog tags on it.
You in the army?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>" What's this?" Giles asked as he returned with David's tea.</p>
<p>"Thanks mate." David said as he took the cup. " Suppose I had better
start from the beginning.</p>
<p>"Albert is a member of the Watchers Council and old friend of Rupert's
during his young and wild days in London. Albert is also an Aboriginal tribal
elder and practitioner of powerful ancient Aboriginal magic. He looked after
me since I was a baby. Taught me the ways of the ancestors and of the
Watchers. Of course there never having been an Australian Slayer he couldn't
teach me everything."</p>
<p>"Never an Aussie Slayer?" Spike asked.</p>
<p>"No need. Until recently there were no vampires in Australia." David told
him.</p>
<p>"No vampires?" Buffy asked sceptically.</p>
<p>"No vampires? Paradise here we come!" Xander whooped, only to be cut down
by his blinding hangover.</p>
<p>"You're telling me that until recently there were no vampires in
Australia?" Spike asked, not quite believing what he heard.</p>
<p>David sighed. "For tens of thousands of years Australia was a vampire
free continent. The reasons behind it are a bit complicated but here goes.</p>
<p>"For 100 000 years the Aboriginals wandered Australia in small nomadic
tribes. They were isolated from the rest of the world, they never built
permeant houses or buildings, and they never developed metal technology. They
lived in the driest, flattest, sunniest place on earth. They had an intimate
knowledge of the land, and had powerful connections to the spirit world.
Vampires never stood a chance."</p>
<p>David saw that none of them got what he was trying to say.</p>
<p>"Look, imagine you are a vampire 500 years ago. Even if you knew that
Australia existed, which almost everyone didn't, who are you going to get
there? Jumbo jet? No ship went anywhere near there. Even if you did, the trip
would have taken almost two years and a vampire would have eaten the whole
crew long before then.</p>
<p>"Say you got there? The sun is a huge problem. Australia is the sunniest
place on earth. Hell, the sun kills thousands of people a year with skin
cancer each year. Where are you going to stay? Book into a motel? Jump down a
sewer? There was nothing there."</p>
<p>"What about caves?" Spike asked, not believing there was a place too
dangerous for him to be in.</p>
<p>"Australia is the flattest place on earth which means not too many caves.
Those caves that were around had underground water in them."</p>
<p>"I don't mind getting wet to avoid the sun." Spike shot back smugly.</p>
<p>David smiled. "You know how I said that Australia was the driest place on
earth? Well because water was so scarce the Aboriginals believed it to be the
blood of the Great Creation Spirit, The Rainbow Serpent. To them it was
sacred, holy. Any water you came across was holy water. Now do you mind
getting wet?" David asked Spike. Spike shut up.</p>
<p>"Even if you found somewhere dry and out of the sun you still had huge
problems to overcome. The very nature of your food source was a problem.
There was only about 300 000 people living in Australia, a land that covers
nearly 3 million square miles. They lived in small nomadic tribes. Your food
was hard to come by. Even if you found them they were far from helpless.</p>
<p>"The Aboriginals never developed metal technology, so if they were going
to attack you they wouldn't use guns or swords. They would use big wooded
spears and spear you through the heart with them. They had an intimate
knowledge of the land, they could detect you, track you and hunt you down
very easily. Aborigines had a deep connection with the spirit world and had
powerful magic to do all sorts of things."</p>
<p>"A place with no vampires. Sounds like heaven." Buffy said quietly.</p>
<p>"Not quite. Because they had no metal technology meant no silver, so
were-creatures had pretty much free reign." David informed them.</p>
<p>"So there was werewolves?" Willow asked.</p>
<p>"No wolves in Australia. Mostly were-dingoes." David chuckled. "Dingoes
ate my baby!" he said thinking of the infamous Lindy Chamberlain case <she
was almost right>. David looked up and saw the discomfort on everyone's face.
Willow looked like she was about to cry. <Why is everyone so up set? There is
a story behind this and I want to know.> David thought.</p>
<p>"Thanks for the history lesson, but why are there vampires there now."
Spike asked.</p>
<p>"British settlement in 1788. They built towns and cities, tunnels and
sewers. The British nearly wiped out the Aboriginals with disease and
slaughtered them like cattle. Water lost its holy status. The British had
silver bullets to deal with the were-creatures. With the advent of the jumbo
jet, the trip to Australia now takes 20 hours, depending on where you left
from. Australia is like any other place now." David said with great sadness
in his grey eyes.</p>
<p>"OK, what has that got to do with us and Riley?" Buffy asked</p>
<p>"Not long ago I got an assignment. Vampires were becoming a real problem.
My government wanted to see how the Initiative dealt with vamps. You know,
tactics, weapons, that sort of thing. The difference is that we don't want to
capture and study them. We want to kill them. So they sent me here to check
out the Initiative. Riley is the liaison between me and his mob. When I told
Albert that I was headed for Sunnydale he told me to see you guys. I'm here
to learn from the Initiative, a Watcher, and the Slayer." David told them.
There was a moment of silence before anyone spoke. Finally it was Xander who
broke the silence.</p>
<p>"I don't remember too much about last night, but I remember you said
something about growing up on a station. What's the story with that?"</p>
<p>David smiled and told them about his childhood, growing up on a massive
cattle station in Western Australia, seeing the ocean for the first time when
he was twelve, some of the experiences he had had. He didn't mention anything
about Giles being his father. That was something that he would tell him later.</p>
<p>"Extraordinary." Giles said. His stomach growled, reminding him that
lunch time had come and gone. "Would anyone like some sandwiches?" Giles
asked. Everyone said yes and he went into the kitchen. When Giles returned
with a plate piled with sandwiches David turned to Buffy.</p>
<p>"So you've heard my story, what's the story with you guys? I bet is
interesting to say the least."</p>
<p>"My friend you have no idea just how interesting." Xander responded.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>Over the next few hours David learnt about how the Scooby Gang came into
being and some of the things they had done.</p>
<p>"Bugger me." David said in astonishment. "Only in America, hey?"</p>
<p>"Only on the Hellmouth." Buffy corrected him. They all laughed. Giles got
up and stretched and saw the sun low on the horizon.</p>
<p>"Buffy, it's nearly sunset. Why don't you and Willow go back to the dorm
and get ready for tonight's patrol." Giles told his Slayer. Buffy got up.</p>
<p>"Come on Will, evil waits for no Slayer." She said. As the two girls got
up to leave David asked "Can I tag along tonight? You know, get some
experience?"</p>
<p>"I don't want you going on patrol until you have the proper training."
Giles told David.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I don't want to have to worry about looking after you while I'm
out there." Buffy said. David became a little angry at this.</p>
<p>"I think that Buffy and I should have a little training season at my
place tomorrow. I think that will change your mind. How about it Slayer
Barbie? You game?" David challenged Buffy.</p>
<p>"Just tell me when and where so I can kick your sorry ass." Buffy
replied, her eyes narrowing at the challenge.</p>
<p>"How about 10am. My place, 1610 Elm Avenue. Rupert can come and referee."
David turned to address the rest of the group. "Hey everyone, come to my
place at 10 and see the Chosen One verses the Thunder from Downunder. Free
admission for pensioners and children under five." In spite of himself Xander
couldn't help but give a little laugh. Giles stepped between them.</p>
<p>"Listen you two I..."</p>
<p>"No Giles, I think Crocodile Dundee here is right. Let's see how good
this so called Thunder from Downunder is." Buffy stared into David's eyes, a
hard determined look on her face. Giles saw that he wasn't going to be able
to talk sense into the two.</p>
<p>"All right, save it for tomorrow." Giles said and turned to David. "You
don't know what you are getting into, do you. Don't say I didn't warn you."</p>
<p>"Fine 10am, 1610 Elm Avenue." Buffy said and walked out with Willow in
tow. There was a silence which Xander broke.</p>
<p>"I had better get going. I start work in an hour." Xander said.</p>
<p>"Where do you work?" David asked.</p>
<p>"At the bar we met last night."</p>
<p>"Great! I'll call a couple of friends and we'll have out ANZAC Day get
together there." David turned to Giles. "Thanks for the hospitality and I'll
talk to you later about the ring." David said with some seriousness in his
voice. He turned, grabbed Xander and nearly dragged him out of the door.</p>
<p>"Come on Xander, we've got a piss up to organise." David whooped as they
left.</p>
<p>Spike raised an eyebrow as they left. " I like him. He's got spunk."
turning to Giles he said "I think tomorrow will be very interesting."</p>
<p>Giles said nothing.</p>

<p>David had made a few phone calls and went to his place to get a few
things. Xander was setting up the bar when David walked in.</p>
<p>"Xander, where's your boss?" David asked.</p>
<p>"I'm right here." said Jack, the owner who was coming out of the back
room. "What can I do for you?"</p>
<p>"I'd like to hold a function here tonight and I want an open bar." David
told Jack.</p>
<p>"I don't know, it's a bit short notice." Jack replied. David pulled out a
wad of notes and threw it to Jack. He looked down, amazed to see a wad of
hundred dollar bills.</p>
<p>"I want snacks and I want bar service. There are going to be quite a few
people here and they can order anything they want. If the money runs out come
and see me and I'll give you more."</p>
<p>Jack looked at David. "Buddy, you got your self a bar." he said.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The bar was packed. David and his friends had managed to get a good
number of the college students to come. Not to hard when there was free
drinks, Xander thought. David had brought in a CD player, explaining to
Xander "I heard the crap that came out of the jukebox here last night. So I
brought my own CD's. More appropriate music for the night."</p>
<p>Xander didn't know if it was appropriate music or not. He had never heard
of any of the bands but it was good music and the party was in full swing. As
a song finished David stopped the music, grabbed a guitar, and sat on the bar.</p>
<p>"OI! SHUT UP!!" David yelled. The bar fell silent.</p>
<p>"Right, now that I've got your attention I've got a couple of things that
need to be said. Today is ANZAC Day, a day which Australians remember all
those who fell in war and those who returned. It is also a day for much
drinking." A cheer from the crowd.</p>
<p>"Anyway I've got a song I'd like to share with you. It's a song about a
survivor of the first ANZAC Day at Gallipoli in 1915, the baptism of fire for
a young nation. So here goes." David began to play the guitar.</p>

<p align=center>Now when I was a young lad I carried me pack<br>
And I lived the free life of the rover.<br>
From the Murray's green basin to the dusty outback<br>
Well I waltzed my matilda all over</p>

<p align=center>Then in 1915, my country said son<br>
It's time you stopped ramblin' there's work to be done<br>
So they gave me a tin hat, and they gave me a gun<br>
And they marched me away to the war.</p>

<p align=center>And the band played Waltzing Matilda<br>
As the ship pulled away from the quay<br>
And admidst all the cheers, flag waving and tears<br>
We sailed of for Gallipoli.</p>

<p align=center>And how well I remember that terrible day<br>
How our blood stained the sand and the water<br>
And how in that hell that they called Suvla Bay<br>
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter.</p>

<p align=center>Jonny Turk, he was waiting, he'd primed himself well<br>
He showered us with bullets and he rained us with shells<br>
And in five minutes flat, he'd blown us all to hell.<br>
Nearly blew us right back to Australia.</p>

<p align=center>But the band played Waltzing Matilda<br>
When we stopped to bury our slain.<br>
We buried ours, and the Turks buried theirs<br>
And we started all over again.</p>

<p align=center>Well those that were left, we tried to survive<br>
In that mad world of blood, death and fire.<br>
And for ten weary weeks I kept myself alive<br>
Though around me the corpses piled higher.</p>

<p align=center>Then a big Turkish shell knocked me arse over head<br>
And when I woke up in my hospital bed<br>
And I saw what it had done, well I wished I was dead<br>
Never knew there was worse things than dying.</p>

<p align=center>For I'll roam no waltzing matilda<br>
All around the green bush farm free.<br>
To hump the tent pegs, a man needs both legs<br>
No more waltzing matilda for me.</p>

<p align=center>So they gathered the cripple, the wounded, the maimed<br>
And they shipped us back home to Australia.<br>
The legless, the armless, the blind, the insane<br>
Those proud wounded heroes of Suvla.</p>

<p align=center>And as our ship pulled into Circular Quay<br>
I looked at the place where me legs used to be<br>
And thank Christ there was nobody waiting for me<br>
To greave, to mourn, and to pity.</p>

<p align=center>But the band played Waltzing Matilda<br>
As they carried us down the gangway.<br>
But nobody cheered, they just stood and stared<br>
And then they turned all their faces away.</p>

<p align=center>So now every April I sit on me porch<br>
And I watch the parade pass before me.<br>
And I see my old comrades how proudly they march<br>
Reviving old dreams of pass glories.</p>

<p align=center>And the old men march slowly, their old bones stiff and sore<br>
They're tired old heroes from a forgotten war<br>
And the young people ask 'What are they marching for?'<br>
And I ask myself the same question.</p>

<p align=center>But the band played Waltzing Matilda<br>
And the old men still answer the call<br>
But as year follows year, more old men disappear<br>
Some day no one will march there at all.</p>

<p align=center>Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda<br>
who'll come a waltzing matilda with me?<br>
And their ghosts may be heard as they march by that billabong<br>
Who'll come a waltzing matilda with me?</p>

<p>There was a very sombre silence in the bar. David looked up to see the
faces of the crowd.</p>
<p>"Anyway, enough of that. Johnno! Music please. Let's get pissed!" David
cried out to the cheers of the crowd. The festive mood returned and David
jumped off the bar.</p>
<p>"Xander!" David yelled over the music. "Another beer please!" Xander gave
David another beer.</p>
<p>"You do remember that you've got a session with Buffy tomorrow morning?"
Xander reminded David. "You keep drinking like that Willow will be able to
kick the shit out of you."</p>
<p>"Xander, mate, don't worry. I think I'll be able to handle Buffy."</p>
<p>"Riley said the same thing just before Buffy kicked him 20 feet across
the room." Xander informed him.</p>
<p>"Look, after tomorrow's session I'll explain everything to you and Giles.
OK?" David said and wandered back to the crowd. Xander liked David. They
shared the same sense of humour, David was a friendly guy who struck Xander
as an older brother type of person.</p>
<p>As the night went on David and Xander became good friends. It was good to
have someone to laugh with and share funny stories. David was the first male
friend Xander had since Jesse died and as such Xander was worried that Buffy
would paste David in the morning. But every time that Xander expressed his
concern David was very casual about it.</p>
<p>When the function was over, David said good night to Jack and Xander and
started to walk home. He hadn't gone too far when a voice hissed out "Hand
over your cash!" David looked around only to see a man holding a large knife.</p>
<p>"You're kidding! You realise how dangerous it is to be out at night,
here?" David exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Just give me your money or I'll slice you open." the mugger said. With
lightning speed David grabbed the muggers knife hand and slammed his other
hand into the muggers elbow. There was a sickening sound of bones snapping
and the mugger cried out in agony, dropping the knife. David then kicked the
mugger in the chest, breaking ribs and sending him flying across the alley.
The mugger smashed into the wall and collapsed into a heap on the ground,
unconscious and bleeding. David looked at the mugger.</p>
<p>"Told you it was dangerous here." David said to the unconscious form.
David then turned and walked away.</p>
<p>"Maybe a vamp will get your sorry ass." David muttered as he left the
alley.</p>

<p>It was 10 o'clock and everyone had arrived at David's place. The place
had started life as a small hotel at the end of the nineteenth century,
complete with 20 bedrooms and a ballroom. It had a lively trade until the
Great Depression when numbers of travellers who could afford to stay there
plummeted. The final straw was the killing of the entire hotel guests and
staff one night in the early thirties by a group of Vampires. The police of
the day attributed the vicious killing to gangsters. It had sat abandoned for
 decades until now.</p>
<p>David greeted everyone instructed them to enter around the back as the
lobby floor still had wet lacquer on it. As they passed through the simple
garden at the back, Xander looked at David in amazement. * Damn! David is
showing no sign of the huge amount of alcohol he drank last night. He
definitely handles his booze better than my father. * he thought. </p>
<p>He then looked over at Spike in his leather motorbike outfit and helmet
with darkened visor. In order for Spike to move around during the day, Spike
had taken up wearing this get up, much to the amusement of Xander.</p>
<p>They entered the ballroom which David had converted into a gym and
workout area. All the equipment had been removed and a small wooden box sat
in the centre of the room.</p>
<p>"All right listen up." David said, reaching into the box and pulling out
two stakes. "The idea here is for Buffy and I to try to stake each other."
David saw the look of alarm on Willow's face.</p>
<p>"Relax Willow. They're rubber, see?" David reassured her by bending the
rubber stakes. A relieved Willow sat with the others on the bench along one
wall. David removed the box and stood in the centre of the room facing Buffy.
He threw her her stake. Buffy just looked at him with cold hard eyes.</p>
<p>"Whoever stakes the other first wins. Understand?" A nod from Buffy. On
the bench Spike leaned over to the Watcher.</p>
<p>"I've got twenty bucks that says the Aussie beats her." Spike murmured to
Giles.</p>
<p>"This is not something you bet on, Spike." Giles whispered harshly. Giles
softened his tone. "I'll meet your wager. But I say David will be lucky to
survive." Giles wanted to desperately talk to David to find out where he had
gotten the ring. After this, provided that David was still conscious, Giles
would take him aside and talk.</p>
<p>"May the best person win." David said and bowed to Buffy. Buffy snapped
off a blisteringly fast kick aimed at David's bowed head. It hit nothing but
air. David had spun inside Buffy, lifted her leg higher and swept her other
foot away.</p>
<p>Buffy landed on her back on the floor. Immediately she rolled away to
avoid David's stake to her heart. She flipped onto her feet and faced David
again. Buffy launched a vicious right hook at David's head, only to have him
duck under it, grab her arm and flip her over his shoulder in a classic Judo
move.</p>
<p>On the floor once again, Buffy flicked her feet up and caught David's
head with them. With a massive grunt, she sent him flying across the room
where he crashed into the wall. Quickly both got to their feet and advanced
on each other again. A right from David was ducked under and she delivered an
elbow to the ribs. A back fist sent her reeling backwards.</p>
<p>David managed to knock the stake out of Buffy's hand and went to stake
her. She caught the hand with the stake in it with her left hand and tried to
punch David in the head with the right, only to have him catch it. The two
were locked together.</p>
<p>David dropped to the ground and started to roll backwards. He placed his
feet on her chest and as she rolled over the top of him, he flicked his legs
and sent her sailing into the wall. Buffy got up.</p>
<p>"CATCH!" David yelled as he hurled Buffy's stake at her heart. She caught
it an inch from its intended target. She gave David an evil smile.</p>
<p>"Nice try." she told him before launching herself at David again.</P>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Everyone sitting to the side was stuck speechless. They had all seen
Buffy fight before, but they had never seen a fight like this. They had been
at it for nearly half an hour. Giles' concerns for David's safety were
groundless as David had punched, kicked, thrown, and blocked as well as
Buffy. It was clear that David had supernatural strength  and stamina similar
to Buffy's. David had speed and skill; Buffy had passion and ingenuity. Both
had determination to win. Neither could deliver the stake to the heart to win
it. Puffing heavily, drenched in sweat, they circled each other, eyeing each
other off, waiting for the others next move.</p>
<p>*Damn he's good!* thought Buffy. *it's so even that I'm going to have to
wait for him to make a mistake.*</p>
<p>*Holy shit! the Slayer sure can fight. I'll have to force an error from
her if I'm to win this.* David thought. *Maybe I'll use a little mojo, but
that ain't fair.* A voice from David's basic combat course entered his mind.
*If it's a fair fight then you aren't doing your job properly.* A smile
formed on his face as a plan came to mind.</p>
<p>Buffy watched as David crouched and leapt up and over Buffy's head. Buffy
stepped forward to give herself some room and turned to face David when he
landed.</p>
<p>THUMP! David landed in front of her.</p>
<p>THUMP! Another David landed to her right.</p>
<p>THUMP! Another David landed to her left.</p>
<p>THUMP! Yet another David landed behind her.</p>
<p>"What the fu.." Buffy started to say but the David to her left threw a
punch. Buffy ducked and delivered a roundhouse kick aimed at his head. She
watched in amazement as her foot passed right through his head. Her spider
sense was screaming to turn around as the real David came in for the kill.</p>
<p>David was surprised that Buffy was able to react to the illusion and how
quick turned to face the real threat. A series of punches and kicks saw both
of them on the ground with Buffy on top of David.</p>
<p>"You think that magic will help you win this?" an extremely pissed off
Slayer roared. In an instant David came up with a last ditch plan.</p>
<p>"No, just this." he said, and then he kissed her.</p>
<p>It was meant to be a quick kiss to stun her for the second or two he
needed. No one expects to be kissed during a fight. It was meant to surprise
her. It ended up a spiritual event; literally.</p>
<p>Magic passed through their lips as they met. The two ancient spirits,
Gangui and Shelgui, touched for the first time in tens of thousands of years.
The experience left them both stunned and unable to move. Buffy was the first
to shake off the stupor. She leapt up, grabbed her bag and left with a very
upset Willow trailing in her wake. The silence after their departure was
thick. It was Spike who spoke up.</p>
<p>"Can somebody tell me who won?"</p>

<p>David watched as Buffy left with Willow, then muttering something
under his breath, he picked up a towel and wiped the sweat off his face.</p>
<p>"What the hell was that?" Xander asked with a touch of anger in his
voice. Although his friendship with the other members of the Scooby Gang was
almost non existent, Xander still felt an obligation to protect them when he
could.</p>
<p>"Look, I'm going to get a drink and then we can sit down and talk.
OK?" David told them. He lead them to the games room where he went behind the
bar.</p>
<p>"Anyone want a drink while I'm here? Orange juice? Tea?" David asked. </p>
<p>Rather distracted, Xander and Giles said no. David grabbed a juice and
went around to sit in the sofa at the other end of the room. He watched as
Giles and Xander looked around the games room in awe. Shifting into serious
mode, Giles sat down opposite David.</p>
<p>"You wanted to explain something?" Giles asked, hoping to get to the
bottom of how David got the ring he gave him the day before. Xander now came
and sat beside Giles, interested in what just happened between him and Buffy.</p>
<p>"OK, to start with, yes I used magic to create those illusions of me
during the fight. Yes I do practice Aboriginal magic and no, that wasn't
Aboriginal magic. That's why I've got this feeling of ickyness and unease
right now." David said with a little shudder. Anytime he used non Aboriginal
magic he was left with a sense of wrongness, it felt dirty. He didn't like
doing it but sometimes he had to.</p>
<p>"OK then, what was the kissing all about?" Xander asked.</p>
<p>"Look, I'm trained to fight. Part of my training is to use the
unexpected to shock my opponent into inactivity for a few seconds so I can
use that time to strike. What's the last thing you expect in a fight? A kiss
would have to be right up there at the top of the list, right? So I kissed
her. I didn't anticipate what happened."</p>
<p>"What happened?" Giles asked.</p>
<p>"Look, the spirit that gives slayers like Buffy their abilities is
called Shelgui. The spirit that gives me my abilities is called Gangui. When
I kissed Buffy these two spirits met and connected for a moment. That's why
it was such an intense kiss.</p>
<p>"I'm not here to seduce Buffy and we are not soulmates, OK? I'm not
here to score with anybody. For some reason Buffy gives me the shits, she
isn't my type."</p>
<p>"What is your type of woman then?" Xander asked sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Well the truth be told I'd say Willow. Red heads float my boat for
some reason." David replied.</p>
<p>"You've got exactly zero chance with her." Xander muttered.</p>
<p>"Xander, I'm here to get some vampire experience and clear up some
family matters. I'm not here to chase chicks."</p>
<p>"What family matters?" Giles asked.</p>
<p>"It is very personal and involves you. I'm happy for Xander to hear
this but are you?" David asked Giles. Giles didn't quite know what to say.</p>
<p>"That's OK, G man. I'll leave you two to talk." Xander said getting up.</p>
<p>"Xander, do us a favour please? Take Spike with you and could you
explain what happened to Buffy. I don't want her getting the wrong idea. OK?"
David asked Xander. Xander nodded and left.</p>
<p>When Giles and David were alone, Giles pulled out the ring.</p>
<p>"Where did you get this?" Giles asked.</p>
<p>"Just before she left London, my mother became pregnant, although she
didn't know this until she got back to Australia. That ring was given to my
mother by my father." It took Giles a few moments to grasp the implication of
what David said. Giles was speechless. Tears formed in both of their eyes.
The two embraced.</p>
<p>"G'day Dad, I'm home."</p>

<p>As Giles and David were coming to terms with their new family
relationship, a rather angry and depressed Xander was returning from Buffy
and Willow's dorm. Things had not gone well. Buffy was extremely upset and so
was Willow for that fact. It seemed odd to Xander that Willow was so worked
up about what happened. There was something more going on but Xander could
not figure it out. Once, he knew Willow. Now she had become as unfathomable
as a black hole.</p>

<p>Xander had explained the reason behind what happened at David's place.
Well, he had tried to explain but, between Willow and Buffy hanging onto each
other and crying and Buffy screaming obscenities at Xander and David, he got
exactly nowhere with it. After five or ten minutes of crying and yelling,
Xander was practically thrown out of their dorm.</p>

<p>Xander was angry at David for doing such a stupid thing to get Buffy
upset. He was even more angry at Buffy and Willow for over reacting to what
Xander saw as a minor thing. He was angry at the way that they had treated
him, at some of the things they said. He was depressed because his two
closest friends, who had been drifting from him for a long time, hardly
seemed like friends at all now. Xander had gained a new best friend, it
seemed, at the expense of two old former friends. He trudged off home to get
ready for work.
</p>

<p>Giles and David sat in silence, their emotions largely controlled.
Giles gathered up his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Why didn't Albert tell me I was a father? I mean don't I have a right
to know such important matters?"</p>

<p>"I was angry too when I found out. But I've had a bit of time to think
about it. I think Albert did the right thing." David held up his hand to
silence Giles' inevitable objection.</p>

<p>"Here me out, please. OK let's think this through. It would have taken
Mum a while to figure out she was pregnant. Then it would have been a bit
longer before she told Albert. By then you were back at Oxford and undergoing
your Watcher training. He could tell that you were destined to be one of the
greatest Watchers one day. You had just began to get your life back together.
If he had told you about me, you would have left to take up a role as father. </p>

<p>"You would not have become a Watcher, Buffy would have got some prissy
dill as her Watcher, she would have been killed and we would be up to our
armpits in hell, fire, and brimstone right now. So when you think about it,
Albert did the right thing."</p>

<p>Giles looked at David, thinking about what he had said. Maybe he was
right, but it still felt wrong.</p>

<p>"Logically I can understand his reasoning, but I still feel it was
wrong." Giles said.</p>

<p>"I can understand that. But I think in the long run we both benefited.
You became a kick ass Watcher who told the Council to stick it where the sun
don't shine." David said with a cheeky little look on his face. "And I got to
be raised in Australia and not in England."</p>

<p>"What's wrong with England?" Giles asked some what surprised.</p>

<p>"Try asking what isn't wrong with England." David smiled. "I mean you
go and invent cricket. You create a nation of cast away convicts. They become
a free and wealthy nation. They beat you at the game you invented. Hell, for
the last 15 years, every time an Aussie cricket team came to England it's
been about as one sided as Hiroshima." Giles had to smile at the friendly jab
at England.</p>

<p>"Bloody colonials!" Giles implored looking to the heavens. They both
laughed, comfortable enough to enjoy the friendly bantor. Giles noticed that
Daivd's sense of humour was similar to Xander's. A bit drier perhaps, but
quite similar. Again there was a comfortable silence as each man got lost in
their thoughts.</p>

<p>"So what now? With us?" David asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Well, maybe it's best we keep this to ourselves for a while. Just
till we get things straight between us." David sugested. Giles nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, let's get a little more comfortable with this before we tell
Buffy and the rest. I want us to be OK before we hit them with this."</p>

<p>"Yep, no sense everyone getting into a flat spin."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>It had been a slow night at the pub and Xander was bored out of his
mind. He absently wiped the bar top for the third time in ten minutes.</p>

<p>"Mate!" a voice called out. Looking up Xander saw David come in
wearing an overcoat and a big goofy grin. Seeing the unhappy look on Xander's
face, David sat on a stool and ordered a beer. Xander returned with the beer.</p>

<p>"What's wrong? Didn't things go well with Buffy?" he asked. Xander
sadly shook his head. David grumbled in sad frustration. * Women, can't live
with them, can't legally kill them.*</p>

<p>"Look, Xander. How about we blow this pop corn stand and kick some
undead ass? Sounds good?" David asked.</p>

<p>"I can't, I'm working. See?" Xander said holding up his dish cloth.
David looked around and saw Jack, the owner at the far end of the bar.</p>

<p>"Jack! Mate! How's it going?" David asked.</p>

<p>"Good, David, good. A bit quiet though tonight. What's up? You looking
to throw another party? If so I'm your man." Jack said smiling. He genuinly
liked the Aussie, especially since David had paid over $15 000 for the other
nights shing ding.</p>

<p>"I'll let you know. In fact I would like ask a favour. Can I grab
Xander so we can have a boys night out on the town? I mean it seams pretty
quiet tonight." David said.</p>

<p>"Sure thing. You guys have fun." Jack said. Xander bolted out the back
to grab his jacket. As Xander headed out the door, David rolled off a hundred
dollar bill and slapped it on the bar. Jack looked at it stunned, them he
smiled.</p>

<p>"You two be careful out there, it isn't exactly safe." Jack said.</p>

<p>"No worries, mate. She'll be right." David said as he walked out the
door.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Why am I out here hunting vamps with you?" Xander asked, regretting
his earlier decision.</p>

<p>"Because you love it." David replied. The two had their stakes ready
as they slowly walked down a back street. Xander stopped.</p>

<p>"What is it?" David whispered. Xander just pointed. There were two
vamps rounding the corner and walking toward them. David smiled.</p>

<p>"Showtime." He said. The vamps charged them.</p>

<p>One attacked Xander while the other took on David. David sent his vamp
flying with kick to the chest. The vamp got up but crumbled to dust as David
threw his stake into the vamps heart.</p>

<p>Xander on the other hand was not going so well. He had dropped his
stake in the fight and was just keeping the vamp from snacking on him. David
saw Xander in trouble. * Note to self. Always carry more than one stake. *
David grabbed the vamp and threw it down the street.</p>

<p>"You OK? Where's your stake?" David asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know, I lost it in the fight." Xander replied. The other vamp
had picked it self up and started run run away.</p>

<p>"Come on, it's getting away!" David implored. Xander started out to
catch the vamp when he stepped on his stake lying on the ground. His feet
went from beneath him and he landed on his butt.</p>

<p>"What the..? Hey, cool! You found your stake. Come on let get him.!"
David said picking up the stake and nearly dragged Xander down the street
after the vamp. The vamp turned down an alley.</p>

<p>They entered the alley and were amazed that the vamp had disapeared.
Walking further down the alley there was no sign of their prey.</p>

<p>"Maybe he ran out the back of the alley." Xander suggested.</p>

<p>"Nope. Dead end." David told him.</p>

<p>"It sure is." A voice said behind them. David and Xander spun around
at the voice. Standing in the entrance of the alley were 6 or 8 vampires,
including the one that they were chasing. David recognised another face.</p>

<p>"Oh shit." David groaned.</p>

<p>"You!" The vamp said. It was the mugger that attacked David the other
night. The situation was bleak for Xander and David. The two of them had one
stake and they faced a whole bunch of vamps.</p>

<p>"Do you know how to use one of these?" David said to Xander as he
pulled out two objects from his over coat and handed one to Xander. It was a
handgun.</p>

<p>"What? Are you nuts? Stakes, sunlight, fire, beheading kill vampires!
Not bullets! You will just piss them off!" Xander near screamed.</p>

<p>"Just let them have it when I tell you to. Alright?" David said,
raking the action of his weapon. Reluctantly xander did the same. He wondered
if he should save a bullet for himself before the vamps turned him or should
he save two bullets. The first one for David for getting them killed.</p>

<p>"Foolish human. Your toys cannot hurt us." A vamp told the two. David
smiled a positively evil smile.</p>

<p>"You know what I have always wanted to say in situations like this?"
David asked.</p>

<p>"What?" Xander replied.</p>

<p>"The path of the rightous man is beset on all sides by..." David
started. Xander could not believe it. They were about to die and David goes
all 'Pulp Fiction' on him. Xander jumped at the sound of a shot being fired.
The vamp looked at the hole were the bullet had entered.</p>

<p>"Didn't work." The vamp said.</p>

<p>"Guess again, knob jockey." David replied as fire flared from the
wound and quickly consumed the vamp. Everyone stood in shock.</p>

<p>"KILL THEM! KILL THEM ALL!" David shouted to Xander as he opened fire
on the other vamps. Seconds later, the sound of gun fire died, leaving Xander
and David with small piles of smoking vamp dust.</p>

<p>"Holy shit! What the fuck did we hit them with!?" Xander yelled at
David.</p>

<p>"I call them Match Head rounds. I've been experimenting with them for
a while. A little white phospherous, some titanium, a dash of sodium. They
burn at about 3000 degrees C. Works pretty good on vamps, I say."</p>

<p>Xander was silent for a moment. Then a thought from his soldier boy
time at Halloween kicked in.</p>

<p>"Aren't bullets like that banned by the Geneva Convention?" Xander
asked. David looked at him like he was an A grade moron.</p>

<p>"Xander, I pretty certain that the Geneva Convention doesn't apply to
vampires and demons. Don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Oh, right. Well, good. We wouldn't want to violate their human rights
now, would we?" Xander joked, feeling like an A grade moron, as the two of
them headed back to Xander's car.</p>

<p>Buffy lazily ran her fingers over the pale skin of Willow's stomach as
the two lay together after their love making. Both were lost in thought and
they were both thinking the same thing.</p>

<p>*There is something really important that is missing here.*</p>

<p>"Buff, can I tell you something? Something really important without
you freaking?"</p>

<p>"Uh, sure Will. What?"</p>

<p>"I, um, I really love being with you. I mean you are the world to me
and, well, I love you. I feel so comfortable with you and you make me feel so
alive, but..."</p>

<p>"But what? What's wrong?" Buffy asked with some fear.</p>

<p>"But I have this feeling. Something is missing. Something inside of
me. It's like a jig saw puzzle with a piece missing." Willow told her lover.
She saw the look come over her Slayer's face.</p>

<p>"Buffy, please don't be upset! I'm just trying to explain how I
feel..." Buffy cut her babble off.</p>

<p>"No! No! I'm not mad Will. I know what you mean. I feel it too. There
is a hole, somewhere deep inside, where something should be. Like, without
it, you can't be complete or happy; really happy."</p>

<p>"Yeah." Willow said. She paused. "What? You feel it too?" she asked,
somewhat shocked. Buffy nodded. There was an uncomfortable silence between
them. Buffy decided to change the subject.</p>

<p>"You got any idea how much I hate that fucking David? He comes here
like some kind of comando Crocodile Dundee and starts messing things up just
when it starts to get better. I've had enough of soldier types fucking my
life around." Buffy spouted.</p>

<p>"Xander and David seem to get along well enough." Willow said.</p>

<p>"Don't get me started on Xander. Try hard loser." Buffy grumbled.
Willow's kiss silenced her anger and the two melted into each others arms.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Giles watched as David trained Xander in hand to hand combat. Almost
two months had passed since David arrived. Seeing the two joke and fool
around as they trained he felt happy that David and Xander had become almost
like brothers. David, his flesh and blood son. Xander, the boy who had become
like a son to Giles. He still had not told Buffy, Willow and Xander about
David being his son. Buffy and Willow's dislike for David meant that they
would not accept him.</p>

<p>Giles had become concerned about Xander. His friendship with David had
broken the already strained friendship with Buffy and Willow. Although Xander
tried not to show it, there was times that the pain of lossing the friendship
came to the surface. Xander locked his emotions away and that was not good.
Like a pressure cooker, it would build and build until it exploded.</p>

<p>"Good. I think we'll call it quits for now." David said when he saw
Giles. Giles had stayed overnight going through David's library and this
morning David would drop Giles home and pick up some of the Watchers Diaries.</p>

<p>"I'll be with you in a sec." David said to Giles. He turned to Xander.
"When I get back we can go down to the armoury and do some target practice."</p>

<p>"Cool." Xander said. "Hey, you know that black shirt you borrowed? Can
I have it back 'cause I'm planing on wearing it to the Bronze tonight."</p>

<p>"OK. Why you going to the Bronze?" David asked.</p>

<p>"Well, with all this training you've been making me do lately I'm all
buffed up. Women won't be able to resist me." Xander told him with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Yeah, sure. It's in my wardrobe, you can grab it while I'm gone, but
it ain't going to do you any good."</p>

<p>"Why?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"Mate, you couldn't get laid in a whore house with a fist full of
fifties." David joked. They had a good laugh and David and Giles left.</p>

<p>Xander had a quick shower and wandered up to David's room to get the
shirt. He opened the wardrobe and had a look. He noticed a uniform hanging
up. It was dark green with gold buttons. On the epaulette was a gold crown
and below that was the letters SASR also in gold. At the top of the sleave
was the word AUSTRALIA and below that as a winged parachute.</p>

<p>Two things that struck Xander were the medals. The first was how few
David had. Having seen the movies where the soldiers had a chest full of
medals, the four that hung there seemed strange.</p>

<p>The second thing was one medal in particular. It had a blood red
ribbon with a bronze cross. In the centre was a lion with the words 'For
Valour' beneath the lion.</p>

<p>"You found your shirt yet?" David said, startling Xander. Xander spun
round.</p>

<p>"Dude! Scare me to death why don't ya. I was just looking at your
uniform."</p>

<p>"Oh, OK." David said.</p>

<p>"Hey, I got a couple of questions though about it." Xander said.</p>

<p>"Like what?"David asked.</p>

<p>"First off, how come you have only four medals? I mean all the army
guy I've seen have heaps."</p>

<p>"We run medals like the English do. You have to have been in combat to
get medals, not like the US were you also get them for passing courses."
David informed him.</p>

<p>"OK then, what about this one?" Xander asked pointing at the medal
with the red ribbon. David looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"It's the Victoria Cross. Look could you just grab your shirt." David
grumped. Deflated, Xander found his shirt.</p>

<p>"Look I'm sorry that I snapped at you. It's just that I got that medal
during the war in East Timor. I lost alot of close friends and it wasn't real
nice and I don't like to talk about what happened too much."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry too. I should just mind my own business."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it mate. Anyway, Giles wants you to go to his place
for a chat tomorrow morning." informed David.</p>

<p>"What's it about?" asked Xander.</p>

<p>"Don't know. You can tell me tomorrow after I get back from the
Initiative."</p>

<p>"What's going on there?"</p>

<p>"I've got to go over some of the electronic detectors they use with
that boof head Riely Finn. I'll be glad when I don't have to see him any
more. Anyway let's go and shoot some targets" David said as he headed for the
door.</p>

<p>The next morning Xander sat on Giles' sofa as Giles fixed some tea.</p>

<p>"So what's the deal, G Man?" asked Xander.</p>

<p>"I'm worried about things between you, Buffy and Willow." Giles said
sitting down across from Xander. Xander for his part looked uncomfortable
with the subject.</p>

<p>"Look, Buffy and Willow have gone off to college and that normally
puts a bit of strain on friendships. But it's no real big, Giles." Xander
said.</p>

<p>"Xander, I've noticed how this has effected you. Just because David,
Buffy and Willow don't get along doesn't mean that things between you and the
girls needs to be bad as well."</p>

<p>"Giles, things were bad before David showed up. Even in high school
they saw me as more of hindrance than a help. Then they went to college and I
didn't and they decided that they didn't need a loser like me any more."</p>

<p>"You are not a loser and they do need you. Together you three are a
powerful force for good. Things are bad now but they don't need to be. Please
go and talk to them. Explain how you feel and you'll find that they still
need you." Giles told the young man.</p>

<p>"Maybe." Xander mumbled.</p>

<p>"No, you will go right now and talk to them this instant!" Giles
barked. A little reluctantly Xander got up and left.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Xander knocked on the door at Buffy and Willow's dorm. After he got no
answer, he wandered down to the common room where he saw the two girls
sitting with their backs to him talking. They were alone in the common room
and hadn't noticed Xander enter. He stopped to listen in on their
conversation.</p>

<p>"I saw David the other night at the pub. He had one of Xander's shirts
on, can you believe it?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"God! Not only is David a loser, he wears another losers shirt as
well." Willow chimed. Xander paled.</p>

<p>"Between GI Joe try hard David and Xander, King of Losers it's enough
to make a woman vomit." Buffy told her lover.</p>

<p>I know, it's hard to believe that I actually loved Xander once. Thank
heavens I came to my senses." Willow said rolling her eyes. Buffy smiled
seductively at Willow.</p>

<p>"Enough with talk of those idiots, give me sugar baby!" Buffy said.
Xander watched as Willow and Buffy started kissing and running their hands
over each others body. He backed out of the room then ran.</p>

<p>Pain. He felt nothing but pain as he ran. His soul, his heart had been
shattered, burnt and crushed. The two people he loved most, the two people he
would die to protect had just destroyed him. All the pain he had kept hidden,
years of pain of all that had ever hurt him now ran through his veins; the
feeling was like fire.</p>

<p>*No more.* He thought as he entered David's place. David was still at
the Initiative. He ran down to the armoury.</p>

<p>*It ends now. No more pain.*</p>

<p>He tried to open the armoury door but was so worked up that he
couldn't enter in the code. He looked around and saw an extension cord on the
work bench. Xander fashioned a crude noose and fastened it to the overhead
beam. Standing on the stool he placed the noose over his head and kicked the
stool over. He dropped a few inches and the cord tightened.</p>

<p>"WHAT THE FUCK!!!!" David yelled. David lifted Xander up and struggled
him out of the noose. Xander was fighting him, balling his eyes out.</p>

<p>"Let me die! Just let me die!" cried Xander as he curled up in a ball
on the floor. David picked him up and took him to the lounge room and put him
on the sofa. Xander began thrashing about and screaming. David kept him on
the sofa with one hand while he dialled the phone with another.</p>

<p>"Hello?" Giles said picking up the phone. He could hear the screaming
in the background.</p>

<p>"Dad! It's me! Come to my place right now! Xander tried to kill
himself!" David heard the phone being slammed as Giles bolted for the door.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"What happened?" Giles asked as he entered the lounge room. Xander was
still thrashing about and moaning.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I came home to find him hanging himself. He's been like
this since I got him down. What could have caused this?"</p>

<p>Giles felt sick.</p>

<p>"I told him to go and talk to Buffy and Willow about their friendship"
Giles wanted to die. </p>

<p>"Something bad must have happened to the girls and Xander must have
found them." Giles said feeling dead inside.</p>

<p>"Xander! What happened? Tell us what happened!" David said shaking the
boy. Xander kept thrashing and moaning.</p>

<p>"It's no use, he can't tell us anything." David told his father.</p>

<p>"We need to know what happened!" Giles insisted. David ran a hand
through his hair in frustration.</p>

<p>"There is some magic I can use to find out. I opens a link between his
mind and mine. It will also have the effect of draining most of that emotion
from him." informed David.</p>

<p>"Is it safe?" Giles asked. He didn't want to lose both of them as well.</p>

<p>"For him, yes. For me, well, it's worth the risk." David said. </p>

<p>He closed his eyes and placed his hand on Xander's head. Instantly
David was assailed be pain. Xander's pain. He saw the reason for his pain,
all the hurt Xander had ever suffered. He years of abuse from his father, the
loss of friends. The betrayal from Buffy and Willow. Xander loved them more
than life itself and they had destroyed him. Xander was strong but they were
so close to his heart and soul that what they had done had destroyed him.
David screamed and pulled his hand away.</p>

<p>"What..." Giles started to say but David cut him off.</p>

<p>"Bitches! Buffy and Willow are alive!" David yelled. He got up and
went to the armoury. Xander was peaceful and sleeping now. David returned
with two pistols and his shoulder holster.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" Giles asked his son. David put on the holster
and started to check his guns.</p>

<p>"They did this to him! Those fucking bitches did this to him!" yelled
David as he holstered the weapons and put on a coat.</p>

<p>"Who did this? Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Buffy and Willow did this to him, Dad! I've fucking had it with those
two fucking bitches. Now they are going to pay." David said in a cold hard
murderous voice. He was gone before Giles could stop him.</p>

<p>A naked Buffy laid down next to a naked Willow. She marvelled at the
witches perfect skin and ran her fingers through her red hair. They kissed,
and as they did so, Buffy knew that this was going to be the best sex of her
entire life. Buffy rolled over and pinned Willow down beneath. Buffy laid a
trail of kisses down Willow's stomach.</p>

<p>SMASH!</p>

<p>The door flew open to reveal David. It was instantly clear that he was
pissed off to epic proportions. He entered the room.</p>

<p>"YOU FUCKING BITCHES!!" David roared.</p>

<p>Buffy for her part was mega pissed at David for bursting in like this
and ruining the moment between her and Willow. She leapt up and attacked
David.</p>

<p>She kicked him in the head twice and let rip with a good half dozen
punches for good measure. However it was no good as David, furious and with
magic flowing through his veins, just took the pounding and smiled. He
unleashed a hail of punches and ended with a roundhouse kick to the head
which sent Buffy flying.</p>

<p>Willow watched as David pounded on her lover. Her anger boiling,
Willow summoned up her magic and sent the TV flying at David's head. David's
head snapped round as the TV approached it. He held out his hand as if he was
stopping traffic. The TV stopped in mid air. He closed his hand and the TV
imploded as if a giant hand had crushed it. A flick of his wrist sent an
invisible force slamming into Willow, sending her crashing into the wall
beside Buffy, who was now up.</p>

<p>Buffy launched herself at David, still a little stunned but even more
angry than before. She went to axe kick him. David blocked the kick and
punched Buffy in the groin. Pain exploded in her, he doubled over and held
herself. David grabbed her head and kneed her in the face. Then, still
holding her head, he head butted her and threw her at Willow.</p>

<p>"This ends now!" He told the two girls who were laying on the floor.
He knelt down and placed a hand on each of their heads. He closed his eyes
and opened the lock he had on the pain he had absorbed from Xander.</p>

<p>Pain. All the world was pain. The beating Buffy took was mere physical
pain. This was an assault on the heart and soul. Images of Buffy and Willow
flowed through their minds. The pain, the soul destroying pain inflicted on
Xander crashed over Buffy and Willow like giant waves at the beach. All the
feelings Xander had ever kept bottled up now made the girls howl like
tormented demons.</p>

<p>As he channelled Xander's pain into Buffy and Willow, David became
aware of something being fed back to him from the two girls. It was a tone, a
musical note. Clear, pure, heavenly. Powerful. He stopped channelling.</p>

<p>Looking at Buffy and Willow curled up and tormented with grief, David
felt a little sorry for them. His anger gone, he wondered at the tone he had
heard. He left the room, closing the door as best he could before heading to
Xander's place. He was going to move Xander's stuff into a room at his place.
To start the healing process, Xander needed to get out of his parents
basement.</p>

<p>David entered the room where Xander and Giles was. Giles sat in a
chair opposite the unconscious Xander, pretending to read a book. Giles was
worried. He was worried about Xander, he worried about David. He worried
about Buffy and Willow. Their strange behaviour towards Xander coupled with
the fact that David had stormed out of here brandishing guns and swearing
revenge, only deepened the worry lines on his face. He heard movement behind
him.</p>

<p>"Hi Dad." David said, somewhat glumly.</p>

<p>"David! You didn't..." Giles started but David cut him off.</p>

<p>"They are OK, at the moment they are probably half way through
uncontrollable crying and heading for a serious grief talk." David assured
his father.</p>

<p>"What did you do?" Giles asked.</p>

<p>"There was a little punch up between me and Buffy and I made them feel
some of the pain that I absorbed from Xander." he looked down at Xander.
"Still no change?"</p>

<p>Giles looked at Xander as well. He shook his head.</p>

<p>"OK. Xander is probably going to be out of it for a few hours yet
which will give me time to move the rest of his stuff into one of the rooms.
He has to get out of that dank little place he's in at the moment." informed
David.</p>

<p>"What do you want me to do?" Giles asked.</p>

<p>"I need you to determine if Buffy and Willow are under some sort of
spell. Their behaviour towards Xander just doesn't add up. If they are then
you need to find out what kind of spell, who cast it, and how to reverse it.
The girls will be around later tonight, I'd expect, so this has to be ready
by then, OK?"</p>

<p>"I'll need to get my books." Giles informed David. David smiled.</p>

<p>"OK, get them while I unload the jeep. I've also got some books that
may be of some use as well in the library." David put his hand on Giles'
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Thanks Dad." he said. Giles returned the smile, happy that David felt
comfortable with him being his father. Things between him and David were OK.
Now Giles needed to make things between his other children better as well. To
this end Giles left to gather the books and other supplies that he might need.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Willow and Buffy entered David's place, uneasy at the possible
reception they would get from Xander. However their need to see Xander to
make sure he was OK overcame their unease. A small voice inside of them told
them that they would be happier without Xander, that he was the root of all
their unhappiness. That voice was ignored for the time being.</p>

<p>They saw Giles come down the stairs and they headed to him.</p>

<p>"Where's Xander?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"Before you see him, I need to check some things. Please follow me."
Giles said. Buffy grabbed him by the arm.</p>

<p>"Where is Xander." Buffy insisted. Giles gave her a cold, hard look.</p>

<p>"Follow me." he said in a voice that brokered no argument. They
followed him.</p>

<p>They entered a room. It was lit by candles and had a symbol painted on
the floor.</p>

<p>"What's this?" Buffy asked suspiciously as she saw the room. David's
voice came from behind them.</p>

<p>"Before you see Xander, we need to check if you two are under some
sort of spell. If you are then it needs breaking." David said. Buffy spun
around, glaring at David.</p>

<p>"What the hell are you up to?" she hissed at him.</p>

<p>"I think you two are under some sort of spell and it needs to be
broken." David told her.</p>

<p>"If you think for one moment that I'm going to let you use your magic
on us then..." David cut Buffy off mid sentence.</p>

<p>"This is not Aboriginal magic, it's book magic. Besides Giles here
will be doing it, not me. So you have a choice, you can voluntarily under go
this or be knocked unconscious. Either way it's going to be done." David said
in a low dangerous voice. Reluctantly Buffy agreed.</p>

<p>"We aren't under any spell." Willow told Giles as they were moved to
the centre of the symbol.</p>

<p>"Willow, if some one with powerful magic put a spell on you them you
would have no way of knowing it was done, you know that as well as I do."
Giles said. He picked up a book and began to recite the spell.</p>

<p>"Mare per delectanto destrani folevum paxus tentabo summum." Giles
sprinkled a red dust over the two girls. A dark blue light shimmered as the
dust settled on the pair.</p>

<p>"Well?" David asked Giles.</p>

<p>"They are definitely under a hate spell. I can't find out who did
this, but who ever they are they are very powerful." Giles informed David.</p>

<p>"Hate spell?" Willow asked, horrified at the thought.</p>

<p>"Yes, it intensifies any negative feelings about a person that you may
have to a point where the closest of friends can become sworn enemies. Who
ever cast this wanted you two to turn on Xander." said Giles.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Buffy. Giles just shrugged his shoulders and picked up a
book and started to search through it.</p>

<p>"Can you reverse it?" Willow asked. The though that some one had made
her turn on her oldest friend chilled her to the bone. Giles found the spell
he was looking for.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think Izard's Reversal spell would do the trick." Giles said.
He began to chant and held forth a white crystal. Buffy and Willow's eyes
flashed first black, then white, then returned to normal. Willow burst into
tears.</p>

<p>"Where is Xander?" she sobbed.</p>

<p>"Up stairs and the second door to your left." David told them. The two
girls raced up the stairs and charged into Xander's room. Soon the three of
them were hugging and crying. Giles stood in the door way and watched. They
had a new and powerful enemy. But for now he smiled as the his family, the
Scooby Gang, were back together again.</p>

<p>It was a sight for sore eyes, Giles thought to himself. Buffy and
Willow, freed of the spell that turned them against Xander, where making up
for lost time. They joked with him, watched TV with him, and generally
smothered him with lots of hugs. Xander, for his part, had responded well to
the attention, even cracking a joke or two. But every now and then, Xander
would retreat back into himself. It was a clear sign that he would need more
than a few hours to recover the damage done to him.</p>

<p>"Doesn't it just make you want to vomit." Spike said as he entered the
room.</p>

<p>"One more comment from you Spike and you will have a date with the
dust buster." Buffy shot back. Spike just shrugged. He knew she wouldn't do
it.</p>

<p>"So, someone is out to get you lot." Spike said up beatly. "I like
them already."</p>

<p>"We need to find out who cast that spell." Giles said, removing his
glasses and cleaning them.</p>

<p>"We need to find them and kick their ass." Buffy said with some
vehemence.</p>

<p>"OK, we don't know who or what did this. But do we know why they did
it? Why turn Buffy and Willow against Xander? What purpose does it serve?
What is there to gain?" David pondered. Blank looks from Giles, Willow and
Buffy. A shrug from Xander and a look of amazement from Spike.</p>

<p>"Bloody hell! You lot are stupid. Who ever it was wanted to break up
the Scooby Gang. Without them, Goldie Locks here would be dead in no time.
You want to kill her, separate her from her friends first. Probably would
have later made Red and Goldie Locks have a lovers tiff." Spike said. "I only
wish I had thought of it before I got this bloody chip."</p>

<p>Giles took a moment for the information to sink in. Spike was right.
Someone was out to get Buffy. Then the rest of what Spike said registered.</p>

<p>"A lovers WHAT? Bloody Hell!" Giles exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, Buffy and Willow are lovers, welcome to the 21st century, blah,
blah blah. Can we get back to the matter at hand?" David told his father. Out
of the corner of his eye David saw the momentary look that crossed Xander
face when he said that. Not good.</p>

<p>"How did you know?" Willow asked, shocked that Spike was privy to such
personal information.</p>

<p>"It's all over town. Some demon saw you to snogging and now it's the
talk of Sunnydale's demon population." Spike laughed. "You should see the
expression on your face, Red. Priceless." The look that Buffy gave Spike made
him doubt his belief that she wouldn't slay him.</p>

<p>"Look, I don't give a fuck what Buffy and Willow get up to together.
There is a big evil out there with the Scooby Gang in its sights. We need to
find out more information." David said, a little frustrated at the diversion.</p>

<p>"Sounds like a research party in the making." Xander suggested.</p>

<p>"Research party?" David asked, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Yeah. We crack out the books, look up the evil and eat donuts."
Xander smiled, thinking of the good times in the library. David looked at
Xander funny.</p>

<p>"You guys need a life." he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, we should try to research who or what did this. But I'm afraid
that we don't have much to go on." Giles informed the group.</p>

<p>"Start the research, I've got an idea on how to get more info on
this." David looked at his watch. "Shit. I've got a meeting with Huckleberry
Hound in 20 minutes." said David.</p>

<p>"Huckleberry Hound?" asked Buffy.</p>

<p>"Riley Finn." David informed her. When she gave him a confused look,
he continued.</p>

<p>"When I read the briefing papers before I came, I saw that the liaison
guy was Riley Finn from Iowa. With the name Finn and coming from Iowa, I
naturally called him Huckleberry Finn. Then when I saw his soldiering
ability, I feel that Huckleberry Hound is more appropriate." Xander had a
good chuckle at that.</p>

<p>"Before you go David." Buffy said, walking over to David. "We owe you
for helping get things normal again."</p>

<p>"No worries. Only glad I could help my friend." dismissed David.</p>

<p>"No. I really owe you and I would like to repay you." Buffy said.
Before anyone could blink, Buffy's knee crashed into David's testicles,
causing him to collapse in a heap. Giles, Spike and Xander all winced in
sympathy pain at the blow. Buffy smiled sweetly.</p>

<p>"Now we are even." she said brightly.</p>

<p>It was 10 minutes before David had recovered enough to leave for his
meeting.</p>

<p>The gang started to research possible suspects who had the power to
cast the hate spell. They had little to go on, however they could rule out
the normal run of the mill demons. They lacked the magic or the smarts for
such a spell. Buffy, for her part, decided to go for the donuts and the
packet of twinkies Xander had requested. She had just left when David came
running in.</p>

<p>"Wow. That was a quick meeting." Xander observed.</p>

<p>"Well, meetings tend to be short when one side is dead." David dead
panned.</p>

<p>"What?" Giles said, not quite getting what David was driving at.</p>

<p>"Riley and the Initiative are dead." David said slowly.</p>

<p>"What? How? Who?" Willow babbled, stunned at the news.</p>

<p>"All very good questions. What ever it was, it was definitely not a
vampire. Vampires like to drink their victims blood. Whatever this was liked
to paint the room with it. Also whatever it was, it ain't no ordinary demon.
The bodies of the soldiers, well what was left of them, had guns and there
was probably a thousand empty cartridges laying around. Whatever it was took
nearly a thousand rounds and still felt healthy enough to tear every living
thing in the complex apart." David said, the images of the bodies of
soldiers, scientists, and captured demons ripped apart like roast chickens
still fresh in his mind.</p>

<p>"We need to warn Buffy." Willow said anxiously. David looked around.</p>

<p>"Where is she?" he asked.</p>

<p>"On a doughnut run." Xander told him.</p>

<p>"Well she should be OK until she gets back. Hopefully she won't be too
long." David paused for a second to gather his thoughts. Time to take charge.</p>

<p>"OK, we know how this thing operates, that should give us an idea on
what to look for." David said.</p>

<p>"Could what ever killed the Initiative be the same thing that cast the
hate spell?" Willow said, afraid for Buffy's life.</p>

<p>"Probably not." Giles informed her. "From the description of the
brutality and viciousness of the attack, it indicates that what ever we are
dealing with is savage, physically powerful, a killing machine of sorts. That
usually precludes any real powerful spell casting ability. But I suppose we
should be prudent and keep an open mind on the matter."</p>

<p>"Right." nodded David. He turned to Xander. "I left a big black
leather book in the games room, could you grab it for me?" he asked Xander.
Xander nodded and left.</p>

<p>"Another good book to start with is Nathanyals Index." David said.
They moved to the selves that were stacked with books.</p>

<p>"Um, sorry to interrupt guys, but I've got a question." Xander said
coming in.</p>

<p>"Sure, shoot." David said.</p>

<p>"Could the demon that killed the Initiative be about 7 foot tall, red
leathery skin, look like the creature out of 'Predator'?" Xander asked. David
looked up at Xander slowly.</p>

<p>"Possibly. Why?" he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. Just that it's in your flower garden out back." Xander
said idly.</p>

<p>"WHAT?" David shouted as he raced to the back windows.</p>

<p>There, in the garden, stood a demon. Man shaped, with long, powerful
arms and red leathery skin covering its' lean muscled body. Claws protruded
from its hands; its face was similar to the creature from the movie
'Predator', with a mass of teeth and yellow eyes. In those eyes burned such
great evil and insanity that made everyone shudder in fright.</p>

<p>"Oh shit. It's a Jachyra." said David, fear making his voice wavier.</p>
