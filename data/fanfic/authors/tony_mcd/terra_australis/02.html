<p>David turned to Xander, fear large in both their eyes.</p>

<p>"Armoury. Match Head rounds. 13-19-01. Go! Now!" said David. Xander
dashed off in the direction of the armoury. David then turned to Willow.</p>

<p>"You know any attack spells? You know, fire, lightning, blow the big
ugly monster to bits kind?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I need to get the right ingredients and look in the right
books." she informed him.</p>

<p>"No time." David told her. He finally looked at Giles.</p>

<p>"OK. If this thing gets past me, you need to get out of here. You,
Xander, and Willow need to find Buffy. Then drive to March Air Force Base.
When you get there..." Giles interrupted David.</p>

<p>"You're not going to fight this..." Giles began.</p>

<p>"DAD! Shut the fuck up and listen! When you get to the main gate, tell
the guards the code word is 'Jericho'. The air movements officer will arrive
and tell him the code word is 'Cotton Tail'. They will then fly you to
Amberley Air Force Base in Australia. Once there, call Albert and he will
take care of things after that." Giles nodded reluctantly. Xander returned
with a shotgun in one hand and an uzi in the other. David took the uzi.</p>

<p>"Protect them." David said indicating to Giles and Willow. " Dad will
fill you in on the rest."</p>

<p>"Dad?" Xander asked puzzled, but David had walked out into the garden.</p>

<p>The Jachyra looked at David as he strolled out into the garden. It
gave a hideous, demented howl of near delight. It was the kind of sound that
made people's blood run cold. David was no exception. David cocked the weapon
then opened fire on the Jachyra, empting the entire clip.</p>

<p>The Jachyra became a brilliant pillar of fire, howling and rolling on
the grass. The fires died out. To David's horror the Jachyra, horribly burnt
and smoking, leapt to its feet. It let loose a howl of pain and delight then
kicked David through the glass windows of the gym/training room where Willow,
Giles and Xander stood. David slid across the floor and laid unmoving. The
Jachyra jumped into the room.</p>

<p>"HEY!" a voice yelled. It was Buffy with Spike beside her. Buffy took
a flying leap at the Jachyra, kicking it in the head. The Jachyra merely
shrugged off the blow and back handed Buffy, sending her flying into the
wall, dazed and unable to move. The Jachyra advanced toward Buffy.</p>

<p>Xander swore in frustration. Match head rounds didn't work on this
creature and he couldn't take the shot at it for fear of hitting Buffy. A
growl and a blonde blur signalled Spikes attack.</p>

<p>The blonde vampire tackled the Jachyra with a tackle that would have
made a rugby coach proud. Spike sat on top of the Jachyra and began to punch
it.</p>

<p>"NOBODY!" Punch! </p>

<p>"KILLS!" Punch! </p>

<p>"MY!" Punch! </p>

<p>"FRIENDS!". The Jachyra caught Spike's arm and, to the horror of
everybody, ripped it off and struck Spike in the head with the arm. Spike lay
unconscious on the floor. The Jachyra got up and began to move towards Buffy
again. Before it could reach her, a set of hands grabbed the Jachyra around
the head. David.</p>

<p>Blue-white spirit fire burst from his hands, enveloping its head. The
Jachyra gave a howl of pain before the spirit fire exploded down its body and
reduced it to ashes. David fell to the ground, his energy gone and unable to
stand. Giles, Willow, and Xander rushed over. Giles went to David.</p>

<p>"Are you alright?" Giles asked his son.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'll be OK. Spirit Fire uses a lot of magic and strength. I
just need to rest for a bit. Go help Buffy and Spike." mumbled David. The
last thing he saw before he passed out was Willow helping Buffy stand and
Giles and Xander tending to Spike's wounds.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>David awoke a little over an hour later. He was laying in his bed and
Giles sat in a chair beside him. Seeing that he was awake Giles came over to
David.</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" he asked. David smiled.</p>

<p>"Fine. How's Buffy and Spike?" asked David.</p>

<p>"Other than a bump to the head and a few bruises, she will be fine.
Spike, well, we bandaged his stump and have given him some pain killers. We
will keep a good supply of blood to him and hope his vampire healing
abilities will be able to handle it." Giles and David looked up when Buffy,
Willow and Xander entered the room.</p>

<p>"Hey Buffy. I like the bump." David said, indicating to the big lump
on her forehead.</p>

<p>"Well, normally I leave the getting bumped on the head thing to your
father." she said as she came to stand beside Giles.</p>

<p>"I guess you want an explanation." David said, referring to the fact
that Giles was his father.</p>

<p>"No need. I explained it to them." Giles informed his son.</p>

<p>"And? How they take it?" asked David. Buffy answered for Giles.</p>

<p>"I'm too busy wigging out about that red demon. Once I'm done with
that, then I'll start wigging out about you and Giles." Buffy grew silent for
a moment. "That thing, was it the thing that cast that spell on me and
Willow?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No. The Jachyra is a killing demon. I'm pretty sure it was the
Jachyra that killed the Initiative. It is a creature of great magic in the
fact that it takes great magic to bring into this world. I guess only magic
could kill it. So, no. But whoever or whatever raised the Jachyra is probably
the same person that cast the spell. Tonight we are going to find out who or
what did this." David said.</p>

<p>"We?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. Tonight Xander and I are going to talk to the Dreamtime
Spirits." said David.</p>

<p>Xander looked at David.</p>

<p>"What do you mean 'we'? Why am I coming with you?" Xander said.</p>

<p>"I need another person to be there in order to do this. I can't contact
the Deamtime Spirits by myself." informed David.</p>

<p>"Ok, but why me?" asked Xander.</p>

<p>"I can't take Willow or Buffy for reasons that will be clear when you
come with me tonight. I also want to give you the chance to find out your
purpose in life. I want you to talk to the Dreamtime Spirits and maybe they
can give you some idea of a direction in your life. I really think that it
would do you a world of good." David told him.</p>

<p>Xander began to object but stopped. *Maybe he's right. I guess a sense of
purpose would be nice. I got nothing to loose.* Xander thought.</p>

<p>"Is it dangerous?" Willow asked David, afraid for Xander's safety.</p>

<p>"Dangerous? Willow, I've saved my best friend from death, had a all an
out and out fight with a witch and her Slayer lover, helped reverse a
destructive spell, and killed an evil demon who killed dozens of heavily
armed soldiers and kicked me through a window. On the scale of things, this
is the least dangerous thing I'll do all week." smiled David.</p>

<p>"Can I talk to Xander alone please?" David asked the gang. They all got
up and left, leaving Xander and David alone.</p>

<p>"What do you want to talk about?" Xander inquired.</p>

<p>"Do you believe in fate and destiny?" David asked.</p>

<p>"Hello. Bestfriends with the Slayer, you know, 'The Chosen One'?"</p>

<p>"OK. Stupid question." David said with a smile. "You want to hear my
views on fate and destiny?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, sure. Go ahead."</p>

<p>"I think life is kind of like a big city and your own life is like
driving through it. You have free choice generally to go in almost any
direction you choose. Left, right, straight ahead, whatever. The roads you
choose are up to you. Sometimes the choices you make lead you into situations
where you have no choice. Like being in the right hand lane and the sign says
'right hand lane must turn right'. Then you have fate. It's kind of like
being at a certain place at a certain time, no matter what you do or where
you go. How you react to fate largely determines your destiny.</p>

<p>"Destiny is just that; the destination. The end of your journey. No one
knows their destiny.</p>

<p>"Then sometimes you have a legacy. A legacy is kind of like someone
coming to their destiny and leaving you rough directions on how to finish the
rest of the journey. It influences people that come after you.</p>

<p>"When you see the Dreamtime Spirits, remember that they can give you
guidence, sometimes tell you of fate, but never of destiny. Fate is not the
same as destiny."</p>

<p>"All right then. When do we go see the Dreamtime Spirits?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"We'll leave at 11 tonight. There is a place a couple of miles out of
town that would be perfect."</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence.</p>

<p>"Xander?"</p>

<p>"Yeah David?"</p>

<p>"Whatever is attacking you guys is my fate. I can feel it." David's voice
grew small and distant.</p>

<p>"I've also got the feeling that it is also my destiny." whispered David.</p>

<p>Xander and David left just after 11 that night. David had cooked up a
Thai Curry Chicken which the gang had wolfed down. Giles had convinced
everyone that it would be best if everyone stayed at David's tonight.
Whatever was after them saw that together the Scooby Gang was a danger so it
would be safest if they stayed together as much as possible. He also
suggested that Buffy and Willow get some sleep because when David and Xander
returned there would be an all night research session. Buffy didn't object.
She was asleep seconds after her head hit the pillow.</p>

<p>David drove into the hills behind Sunnydale and turned up a dirt
track. Xander dozed as David followed the track as it led through a
plantation of tall trees. The jeep hit a bump in the road, waking Xander. He
looked around as they drove past the ghostly white trees.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" asked Xander.</p>

<p>"In a eucalypt plantation about 10 miles out of town." informed David.</p>

<p>"A what?"</p>

<p>"A eucalypt tree plantation. Eucalypt trees are native to Australia.
Apparently the hills around here were prone to erosion since the soil was so
poor here and pretty much nothing would grow here. However eucalypt trees
thrive in poor soil. The down side is that they liked it too much and became
a bit of a pest. Then they discovered that the eucalypt has medicinal oil in
its leaves and the wood very strong and hard so now they are cutting them for
wood and the oil." David told Xander. He stopped the car.</p>

<p>"We walk from here."</p>

<p>They got out and started to walk through the trees. Clearing the trees
Xander saw that they were headed for a hill which had been cleared except for
a cluster of trees at its summit. David held a bag that contained the
necessary things for the ritual. As they neared the summit Xander's curiosity
got the better of him.</p>

<p>"OK, what am I supposed to do that Buffy or Willow couldn't?"</p>

<p>"It's not a matter of couldn't, it's a matter of wouldn't. You find
out." David grinned as the reached a small clearing in the trees at the top
of the hill. He put the bag down and started to clear a patch of earth.</p>

<p>"We need some wood for a fire, after we get it lit then I'll explain
what is going on." said David. The pair gathered wood and David arranged it
in the clear patch of earth.</p>

<p>"You going to light it using fire sticks?" Xander asked, remembering a
thing he learnt in his brief stint as a Boy Scout. David just looked at him
like Xander had said 'this cheese will not protect you'.</p>

<p>"No. This is the 21st Century. I use my lighter." David said as he
pulled out a battered Zippo lighter and started the fire. The light it
produced made their shadows dance and the smell of the burning wood was sweet
and calming.</p>

<p>"So what do you want me to do?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"I need you to use these clacking sticks." David said as he pulled two
wooden sticks that were covered in white paint dots.</p>

<p>"All you need to do is tap them together in a rhythm like this." David
demonstrated for Xander.</p>

<p>"Then as you do that I'll perform the ritual and call upon the
Dreamtime Spirits to embrace us."</p>

<p>"What will happen then?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"We will travel to the Dreamtime. Remember that the spirits will
appear in a form that you are best able to understand and accept. For
example, they appeared as figures from Ancient Greek mythology to the ancient
Greeks and as angels to Christians. It's just a matter of what you are
comfortable with and can relate to." David told Xander.</p>

<p>"OK, now strip." David said. Xander looked at him in panic.</p>

<p>"What?" Xander said, not quite believing what David said.</p>

<p>"Take your clothes off."</p>

<p>"No way!"</p>

<p>"You have to."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You must enter the Dreamtime in the same state as you entered this
world. Which means you have to be naked. So now you know why Buffy or Willow
wouldn't do it. Don't be such a baby." David said.</p>

<p>"But..."</p>

<p>"Oh bloody hell! I'm into women, OK? Trust me you have nothing that I
haven't seen else where. Just hurry up and stop fucking around!" David
groused.</p>

<p>The two stripped and placed their clothes at opposite ends of the
clearing. David turned around and saw Xander.</p>

<p>"Holy Shit!" David cried out and pointed.</p>

<p>"WHAT?" Xander yelled.</p>

<p>"Get a load at it! It looks like a baby's arm holding an apple!"
Xander tried to cover himself.</p>

<p>"SHUT THE FUCK UP!" Xander screamed.</p>

<p>"Sorry mate. I just got to ask something. You had sex with Anyanka?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" Xander said, not happy at all.</p>

<p>"I think you got her back for a thousand years of making men suffer."
David said with grin.</p>

<p>"Can we just get on with this and stop talking about Little Xander?"
asked Xander. David gave him the sticks and they commenced the ritual.</p>

<p>David threw a handful of dirt into the fire then drew pictures in the
ground, all the while chanting. He then placed a heap of eucalypt leaves on
the fire, creating a huge amount of sweet smelling smoke.</p>

<p>"Lawurl bohrre-na nardal labld-ndi jut-di dongo-yan dei marluga
walbararri. Dongo-yan dalmerilal giyakgiyak gugiwu gawor-ubawo gitjjiya
gapbut langitj-gun wordow-ma."</p>

<p>(Spirit of the Dreaming, we ask for your wisdom, old man of the Milky
Way. Knowing of yesterday, today and tomorrow the truth, man who goes by
night bring about the Dreaming.) At that moment there was a flash of white
light.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Xander found himself standing next to David. The first thing Xander
noticed was that they weren't naked any more. The next was their location.</p>

<p>They were standing in a lightly wooded area. Small bushes grew in the
red earth and silence gripped the night.</p>

<p>"Where are we?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"The Dreamtime." David said. He pointed up into the sky. "Look." David
told Xander. Xander looked up and gasped.</p>

<p>The sky was awash with stars. Thousands, tens of thousands of stars
twinkled above them. Xander remembered the happy times that he and Willow
spent out in the backyard. They used to lay on their backs and look at the
stars. Willow would tell him the names of the constellations and some of the
stories behind them. They would often imagine that they were floating in a
sea of stars. They were happy times. Before Buffy. Before vampires. Before
the realisation.</p>

<p>But something about it was wrong. It was hard to pick out the
constellations from all the stars. Then it struck him.</p>

<p>"My God! The stars are upside down!" Xander exclaimed in awe.</p>

<p>"No. They are as how they appeared in Australia tens of thousands of
years ago. Come. We are expected." David said and headed towards a camp fire
in the distance.</p>

<p>They arrived at the fire and there was an old Aboriginal waiting for
them. David spoke to him in his native tongue. David nodded and turned to
Xander.</p>

<p>"He tells me that they are waiting for you through those wattle
bushes." David said, pointing to a stand of bushes, 9 feet high and with
beautiful yellow flowers.</p>

<p>"Who's waiting for me?" Xander asked his friend.</p>

<p>"Go and receive your guidance. I will be here finding what is hidden.
Go and find your purpose. Go." Xander left David and the old man and started
to make his way through the wattle bushes. He emerged into bright sunlight.</p>

<p>He found himself at a waterhole which was ringed by trees and had a
waterfall descending from the rockface above the clear water. It was warm and
very peaceful and Xander felt more at home than he had ever felt. He looked
at the waters edge on the far side and saw them. Three of them. They walked
towards him and as they got closer Xander recognised them.</p>

<p>Jenny Calendar walked hand in hand with two young girls. One was
blonde and the other had red hair. Both looked about 7 or 8 years old. The
blonde looked kind of like Buffy, but there was no doubt who the red head
was. Willow. Jenny let the girls go and they ran to Xander, nearly knocking
him over and hugging him fiercely.</p>

<p>"Xander!" The two little girls cried out. Dumbfounded Xander looked at
them and then hugged them back. Tears poured from his eyes, the happiness of
the moment too much. Jenny came up to him.</p>

<p>"Hello Xander." She said. Xander looked at her.</p>

<p>"How...?" he started but words failed him. Jenny bent down and spoke
to the girls.</p>

<p>"Buffy, Willow. I need to talk to Xander for a little while. Why don't
you two go and play? Maybe you can find Xander a present." With a giggle the
two girls ran off to some rocks by the water.</p>

<p>"Miss Calendar, what... I mean how... ur... why?" Xander babbled.</p>

<p>"You want to know of your purpose? What your reason is in life?" she
asked him.</p>

<p>"Yes." whispered Xander.</p>

<p>"They are the reason, they are your purpose." Jenny said pointing to
Willow and Buffy. Buffy started to chase Willow and Willow started screaming.</p>

<p>"Buffy! Stop chasing Willow around with that frog." Jenny called out
to the girls. Buffy put the frog in the water.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Look at the girls. What do you feel?" she asked him. He looked at
them.</p>

<p>"I love them. I feel like I'm their big brother. They mean everything
to me." The two girls came up to Xander.</p>

<p>"We've got something for you." Buffy said. She held up a three leaf
clover. She smiled as he accepted it from her.</p>

<p>"That is what we are, Xander." Buffy told him. Willow held up her hand.</p>

<p>In it was an opal. Black with a rainbow of colours exploding from it
as the sun shone on it. Xander accepted it from Willow.</p>

<p>"Keep it always. You will need it one day." she told him.</p>

<p>"Thank you. These are the best presents." He told the girls. They
giggled and ran off to a log at the other side of the clearing. Jenny took
Xander by the arm and led him to a large rock. They sat together.</p>

<p>"You want to know what you are? You are saviour, protector, and
father. When the time comes, do not doubt yourself. Reach within and bring
forth that for which you are.</p>

<p>"Buffy and Willow have given two gifts. I also will give you two
gifts. The first is magic to show the others what is to come." Jenny touched
Xander's hand. A white glow moved from her hand to his.</p>

<p>"The second is memory. For a 100 thousand years the Aboriginal people
passed down there magic and lore by word of mouth. They never developed
writing but needed to preserve their collected knowledge. So they had magic
which enabled some of them to remember everything. The perfect memory. The
Yhi-ja. This gift was handed down from generation to generation. Like Albert
gave this to David, I give this to you." she touched his head.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>David opened his eyes. He shook his head to clear the disorientation.
He was back at the hill top. He knew who was behind the spell. He knew what
his actions must be. But there was still so much left unanswered. He wandered
to his clothes and got dressed. When he turned around he saw Xander lying on
the ground. David raced over and checked him.</p>

<p>Xander's eyes were open. And they glowed sky blue.</p>

<p>"The Yhi-ja!" David exclaimed to himself. He gathered up his things
and Xander's clothes, then picked up Xander and took him to the jeep.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"Dad! Dad!" David yelled as he entered his house. David took Xander up
to Xander's room and put him in the bed. Just as David covered Xander Giles
came running in.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he said.</p>

<p>"I need you to look after Xander of a while." David told his Dad.</p>

<p>"What happened?" Giles asked as he saw Xander's eyes. At that moment
Buffy and Willow raced into the room.</p>

<p>"What the hell have you done to him?" Buffy demanded to know.</p>

<p>"I didn't do anything! The spirits must have given him the Yhi-ja.
It's the ability to remember everything. He'll be out of it for a couple of
days." David told them.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with his eyes?" Willow cried out.</p>

<p>"Nothing! Don't worry! I went through it when I was 7. He'll be fine.
I just need you to look after him while I'm gone."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" Buffy demanded again.</p>

<p>"I've got to find a book and arrange a few things." he said to the
angry Slayer.</p>

<p>"What about whoever or whatever cast the spell and sent the Jachyra?"
Giles asked. David grabbed his father but the arms.</p>

<p>"The demon's name is Murg Dor." David said before leaving.</p>

<p>David sped into the night. There was much he had to do and little time
to do it in. He reached for the car phone and punched in a series of numbers.
When the electronic chirp told him that he had an encrypted line, he dialled
a number.</p>

<p>The phone which rang was the encrypted line, General Morris noticed as
sleepily reached it. The general was a stocky man who lived on base alone.
His marriage had failed years ago as the result of the extended absences from
home that military service required. He now dedicated his life to the
military as a way of protecting his 19 year old daughter who was attending
college in Colorado.</p>

<p>"General Morris." the general said into the phone.</p>

<p>"Sir, it's Major McWray, the Australian Army liaison officer to the
Initiative. I have an urgent matter I need to inform you of." David told the
general.</p>

<p>"What ever it is it had better be worth waking me for." the general
grumbled. He knew Major McWray to be a fine and experienced officer, but that
fact didn't make getting woken up in the middle of the night any easier.</p>

<p>"Sir, the Initiative was attacked by a powerful HST sometime this
evening. I regret to inform you that they took 100% KIA. I discovered this
when I went there for a briefing with Special Agent Finn. I was able to track
the HST to its nest where I disposed of it using 50 pounds of Thermite."
David lied about the killing of the Jachyra. The general didn't need to know
about magic or the Slayer, not just yet any way.</p>

<p>"My God! 100% KIA! What kind of HST could do such a thing?" the
general said, sitting up and fully awake.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure but I have some slim evidence that this attack was
organised by an outside group. I haven't got very much to go on but I believe
that they might be heading to Europe, most likely London and then to a second
country as yet unknown. I need to get to London as fast as possible to try to
catch up with these people." David lied for a reason, he needed to get to
England as fast as was possible, and the general could arrange faster
transport than flying commercial airlines.</p>

<p>"Ok, I'll try to arrange some transport for you. Where are you?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I'm about an hour away from March Air Force Base." David told
the general.</p>

<p>"Fine, I'll have your plane waiting there for you. But you are not to
release any information about this incident or the Initiative operations to
anyone with out my express permission. Is that understood?" ordered the
general.</p>

<p>"Yes sir."</p>

<p>"Good. When you get back I want a full report. Good luck and good
hunting, Major." the general said hanging up. David hung up and decrypted the
phone. He then dialled a number.</p>

<p>"Hello, Albert? It's me, David. I'm coming to see you."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Buffy and Giles sat around Xander's bed reading through a pile of
books, trying to find something on Murg Dor. Every now and then Xander would
stir listlessly as if having a bad dream. Buffy slammed shut the book she was
reading in frustration.</p>

<p>"Damn it Giles! Nothing on Murg Dor in here." she said in frustration.</p>

<p>"Well, go through this one." Giles said and handed her another thick
tome to search through. Buffy looked up as Willow entered the room.</p>

<p>"How's Spike?" Buffy asked her lover.</p>

<p>"A little better, I left him some blood packets for him when he wakes
up. I'm pretty sure that he'll be up and about in a day or so." Willow
informed Buffy. She looked at Xander.</p>

<p>"Any change?"</p>

<p>"No." Buffy told her. At this point Xander stiffened suddenly. His
eyes opened revealing the sky blue that swirled across them. He began to
speak.</p>

<p>"Hello." Xander said, his voice was strange. Not the deep man like
voice he had, but almost like a child.</p>

<p>"Hello." he said again, but this time the voice was that of a little
girl.</p>

<p>"Does it hurt?" Xander asked in the little boy voice.</p>

<p>"What?" he said in the little girl voice.</p>

<p>"Giles, what's going on?" Buffy asked the Watcher who silenced her
with a wave of his hand.</p>

<p>"Does your hair hurt? 'Cause it's all red like it's on fire." Xander
spoke in the little boy voice. Willow gasped, she knew what was going on.</p>

<p>"No, my hair's not on fire, it's just red, see? You can touch it if
you want." the little girls voice said.</p>

<p>"Oh. Cool!" the little boy said.</p>

<p>"My name is Xander." the little boys voice said.</p>

<p>"I'm Willow." the little girls voice replied. Xander smiled then
closed his eyes and slipped back into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>"Willow, what the hell was that all about?" Buffy asked the wiccan.</p>

<p>"Um... When I first met Xander on the first day of preschool he asked
me if my hair was on fire. He hadn't seen anyone with red hair before."
Willow told her, stunned. The voices were hers and Xander's as they were as
kids.</p>

<p>"Can anyone tell me what this is all about?" Buffy demanded to know.
Giles contemplated for a few moments before saying anything.</p>

<p>"I can only hazard a guess, but David said that Xander had undergone
the Yhi-ja. It is designed to give him the ability to remember everything.
I'm guessing that he is in the process of remembering everything that has
happened in his life. All the important things that effected him strongest he
would remember the strongest. I suppose that meeting you Willow was an
important event in his life." Giles reasoned. He was not far from the truth.</p>

<p>"Oh boy. I don't know if we want to around for many more of these
memory flash backs." Willow told Giles and Buffy.</p>

<p>"Why?" Giles asked her.</p>

<p>"Because a lot of Xander's memories aren't exactly good ones." she
said, a look of concern on her face.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The B1-B touched down in the early morning light at an airfield in
England. David emerged from the plane very happy at the experience of flying
in the giant swing wing bomber. He quickly located the car waiting for him
and drove to Albert's place just north of Manchester.</p>

<p>"Good to see you, David!" Albert said as he hugged the young man. The
pair sat in the living room with a pot of tea and some toast on the coffee
table.</p>

<p>"So, what is happening with you lately?" Albert asked the young man.
David told Albert everything about what had happened since arriving in
Sunnydale. At the end of it Albert wore a very concerned look on his face.</p>

<p>"Murg Dor is after the Slayer?" Albert asked.</p>

<p>"It would appear so. Anything happening with the other Slayer?" David
enquired. With the death of Faith in jail, the next Slayer had been called.
She was 13 and she was in training in Scotland.</p>

<p>"Nothing." Albert replied. He nibbled on a piece of toast idly. "So
you went to the Dreamtime Spirits and among other things they told you to get
a book."</p>

<p>"The Chronicles of Golgotha." David told the old man.</p>

<p>"The Chronicles of Golgotha? Good luck getting them." Albert chuckled.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" David asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. It's just that they are locked away in the Vatican Black
Library." informed Albert. The Black Library was where the Vatican kept it's
books which it regarded as too dangerous in the wrong hands.</p>

<p>"The Vatican you say. Well it looks like I'm off to Rome then." said
David.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. You think that they will just let you in there and
take the book?" Albert asked.</p>

<p>"No, of course not. I'm going to nick it." David smiled back at the
old man. The old man recognised the twinkle in David's eye. It was the look
when he was going to do something very wrong and have a hell of a lot of fun
doing it. David stood to leave.</p>

<p>"Well, I better get going now." David said.</p>

<p>"Ok. You look after yourself and try not to get arrested. OK?"</p>

<p>"All right. But I need you to do something for me." David told Albert.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Albert asked.</p>

<p>"Could you get hold of a big leather bound book? You know the type
used for Watcher's Diaries, but with blank pages." he asked.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but why do you want it?" asked Albert.</p>

<p>"I need to write prophecies of what is to come. Some of it I
understand. Most of it I don't."</p>

<p>"I'll have it ready in a day or two." said Albert.</p>

<p>"Good. I'll pick it up on my way back from Rome. The only problem is
I'm not sure what to call it." David said.</p>

<p>"You will think of something, I'm sure of it." Albert reassured him.</p>

<p>It had been 6 days since David brought Xander back from the Dreamtime.
In that time they had sat down and researched Murg Dor while keeping an eye
on Xander. They had listened as Xander had flash back through his life, from
the beginning to the more recent times. The good times, the funny times, and
as Willow had warned, a lot of bad times. The abuse by his parents, his
failures at school, his broken relationships. It was heart breaking to
witness Xander weeping as he unconsciously recounted the night Jesse died. He
had been quite now for about three hours and Giles slept in the chair beside
Xander's bed.</p>

<p>Buffy came in and on seeing Giles sleeping she smiled at the sight.
His glasses were half way down his nose and a leather book lay in his lap.
Buffy felt a special love for the man who was her Watcher. He had been more
of a father than Hank Summers had ever been. Giles had put his life at risk
more times than she could recall for her. Not only her but all the Scooby
Gang. He would never abandon her, never hurt her, he would die to protect
her. She quietly picked up the book out of his lap. Giles woke with a start.</p>

<p>"Whuh? Huh? Oh. Buffy." He said coming fully awake "Where's Willow?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"She is sleeping in the room next door. Any change in Xander?"</p>

<p>"No, he has been quiet for a few hours. How is Spike?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He left about an hour ago. Said he was tired of being cooped up. I
think he just needs some space to figure out what is happening with his life.
Well, unlife." she amended. The loss of his arm and the conflict of feeling
he had towards the gang was a lot for him to deal with.</p>

<p>"You haven't heard anything from David yet?" she asked him. He just
shook his head. Buffy inwardly raged at David. He pissed her off, he had hurt
her and Willow, and he had put Xander in danger and then run off. But she
held her tongue for Giles sake.</p>

<p>"I take it that you haven't found anything more on this Murg Dor since
last night?" she inquired.</p>

<p>They had found a few things on Murg Dor. Murg Dor was a powerful demon
warlock who had raised an army of vampires to rid the world of humanity. He
and his army was defeated and banished to the ethereal plane by a group of
ultra powerful witches and a small band led by the then Slayer and mysterious
man. Both the Slayer and the man died of the wounds they sustained in the
battle. Murg Dor had powerful magics to conjure demons, slow time, command
vampires, and a host of other things that were not pleasant to read. But they
had not found out how to defeat Murg Dor or why he was after the Slayer and
Scooby Gang. Xander stiffened, signalling another flash back.</p>

<p>"Come on, Will. Look, you don't have a choice here. You gotta wake up.
I need you, Will. I mean, how am I gonna pass trig, you know? And who am I
gonna call every night... and talk about everything we did all day? You're my
best friend. You've always... I love you." Xander said. Willow's voice
sounded from Xander.</p>

<p>"Oz?"</p>

<p>Tears rolled from Xander's sky blue eyes. Silence pervaded the room,
only to be broken by the sound of sniffing coming from the door way. Buffy
and Giles turned to see Willow standing in the door way, she too had tears in
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Willow! Wait!" Buffy called out but Willow ran into her room and
locked the door. Buffy knocked frantically on the door.</p>

<p>"Willow, please let me in. Let's talk about this." Buffy pleaded.
After a few moments Buffy heard the door unlock. Buffy went through and saw
Willow laying on the bed crying. Buffy held her lover and Willow cried in her
lap. Buffy felt helpless to console Willow, a multitude of thoughts and
feelings going through the Slayer. Soon Willow would be willing and able to
talk, but Buffy didn't know what to say to her lover.</p>

<p>Willow's sobbing had eased enough for her to talk.</p>

<p>"Damn him! How could God damn Oz do such a thing! I always thought
that it was Oz that said 'I love you', but it wasn't and he knew it but he
let me think that he had said it. Damn you Oz! Damn you to hell!" Willow
began sobbing in earnest again.</p>

<p>"Shhhh... it's OK Willow" Buffy said cradling Willow in her arms,
trying to comfort her.</p>

<p>"Maybe Oz was afraid off loosing you to Xander. You're the most
wonderful person in the world and no one would want to loose you to anyone
else." Buffy said, partly to explain Oz's motives but mostly to express her
own feelings right now. Willow took a deep breath and wiped her eyes.</p>

<p>"Willow, tell me. How do you feel towards Xander?" Buffy asked,
fearful of the response.  Willow was silent for a moment, contemplating her
feelings.</p>

<p>"Buffy, I love Xander." Buffy's heart stopped. "I loved Xander since I
was little and I guess I always will love him. But too much has happened, too
much water has passed under the bridge between me and him. Xander and I can
never go back to the way things used to be. I love him but not in the same
way I love you. He has always been a part of me and I hope he always will,
but you Buffy, you are the one for me. You are like the sun's morning rays
chasing the darkness away. I want to fall asleep in your arms at night and
wake in them in the morning. I wants us to be together. I want you. I love
you." Willow kissed Buffy softly on her lips.</p>

<p>Buffy's heart soared. Happiness flooded her very being. She kissed
Willow back and embraced her, never wanting to let her go. They held each
other for the longest time, just thinking and feeling. Buffy thought about
the people in her life. Willow was the most important thing in her life. She
thought of her mother and how brave and understanding she had been for Buffy
over her life.</p>

<p>She also thought of the men that had entered her life and of all of
them; her father, Angel, Parker, Riley; only two would never abandon her.
Giles and Xander. Giles loved her like a father, indeed he had been sacked
from the Council for just that. Buffy wished he was her real father. She
could not think of a better man to be her father, nor a better man to care
for her mother. That thought both attracted and repulsed her at the same time.</p>

<p>Xander. It was hard to describe what she felt for Xander. An image
flashed through her mind. Xander, clad in white armour, astride a white horse
like a knight of old, bearing her and Willow's standard. At times he fought
dragons, at others, windmills. Buffy wasn't sure why she had that image in
her mind. But the more she thought about it the more it became appropriate.
He was her paladin, her champion, wether she needed one or not. He would go
into battle for her and Willow regardless of the danger.</p>

<p>Her thoughts were interrupted by a commotion from down stairs.</p>

<p>"Hello? Dad? Anybody home?" David's voice called out. Buffy leapt up
and raced down the stairs. David saw Buffy charging down the stairs.</p>

<p>"Hey Buffy, where's... " he got no further as Buffy's fist smashed
into his face, sending him flying. Giles came down the stairs, followed by
Willow. David picked himself off the floor, rage burning in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't you ever just say hello? What the fuck is your malfunction?"
David demanded to know. Giles and Willow looked on, not daring to interrupt.</p>

<p>"You! You're the malfunction! You are nothing but trouble. You come
here and cause all kinds of trouble. You get some kind of hate spell put on
me and Willow which nearly killed Xander and then you take him and get some
other spell which causes all sorts of bad memories to surface then you leave
him!" Buffy nearly screamed at David.</p>

<p>"Bad memories? You think that Xander or you are the only ones with bad
memories? Everyone has bad memories, things they would rather forget. Well
guess what? Xander and I don't have the option of forgetting. He will have to
live with the memories of everything he ever did wrong in the forefront of
his mind for the rest of his life. As I do too.</p>

<p>"As the Slayer you have had death and woe as your companion. Big
fucking whoop! I'm a soldier. I also have death as my constant companion. But
unlike you, my battles have not been so black and white. Human verses demon.
Good and evil. I fought people, with souls like you or I. Some of those had
committed unspeakably evil acts while I had to watch and do nothing.
Sometimes I later got the chance to avenge the death of innocent people, but
sometimes not. I've had to kill others who's only crime was being scared for
themselves and their families because some thug told them they were to fight
us or have their family butchered.</p>

<p>"I also lost friends. People who I spent years with, people who I had
the strongest bonds you could not imagine. Maybe you could. They were to me
like Willow and Xander and Giles are to you. I had to give orders to some of
them which guaranteed their death for the sake of the mission. I also had
some of them die because I fucked up. I walked the unit straight into an
ambush. Fine, we beat them. They give me  medals and promotions but they
could not give me peace. They cannot take away the memories. The memories of
my friends being cut down, the memory of holding my best friend, crying like
a baby as I watch his blood and brains ooze out of what remained of his head
after a bullet blew it open. They can't take away the memories of wives that
lost their husbands and children asking where their Daddy went. No one can. I
have to live with all this every second of the rest of my life.</p>

<p>"So you ever so much as think that I don't care about Xander, or you,
or Dad, or Willow, I will blow your fucking brains out and hope the next
Slayer isn't such a selfish bitch."</p>

<p>David and Buffy glared at each other, their breathing ragged with
rage. The sound of Xander coming down the stairs interrupted them.</p>

<p>"Xander, what... " Willow began to ask but Xander walked right past
her, his eyes sky blue, walking in a trance. He stopped. Lifting his hand
Xander created a shimmering silver screen. Images began to appear.</p>

<p>It was an army. An army of vampires. They were charging up a hill
towards a group of people. There was hundreds, maybe thousands of vampires
racing for the summit where the small group of people were. Arrows fired at
the people, their shafts filled the sky. The sky was dominated by the sun,
eclipsed by the moon, casting it's shadow over the land and bringing forth
night. The images slowly faded and Xander began to speak.</p>

<p>"Six shall be called. The Chosen One and 5 who must protect her lest
hell return to earth. Six shall fight the army of the demon prince." Xander's
eyes rolled back and he collapsed on the floor. Buffy and Willow raced to the
fallen Xander. David didn't move. His face was blank from shock. Finally
David spoke.</p>

<p>"My God! It's the War Of The Six!"</p>

<p>They all sat in the lounge room, trying to come to grips with what had
happened. Buffy and Willow bombarded Xander with questions at such a rate
that he couldn't answer the few questions that he could. Giles looked at
David who was still in shock.</p>

<p>"David, what is this War Of The Six all about?" Giles asked gently.
David came out of his shock and shook his head as if to clear it.</p>

<p>"Uh, I need to talk to you Dad. In the library. Now." David said
getting up. Xander looked at David.</p>

<p>"Where are you off to now?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"To the library to talk to Dad. In the mean time I recommend you talk
to these two." David said indicating to Buffy and Willow. David and Giles
disappeared into the library.</p>

<p>"So, Xander. What exactly happened with you when you went to see the
Dreamtime Spirits?" Willow asked her friend. Xander thought for a moment
before responding.</p>

<p>"I saw... I saw you, and Buffy, and Miss Calendar. It was at this
beautiful waterhole. And you and Buffy were little. Like 7 or 8 years old.
Jenny gave me the magic for that vision I showed you and the memory thing.
You guys gave me a present each too. Here." Xander said as he dug around his
pocket to retrieve the items. He held the three leaf clover and the black
opal.</p>

<p>"Willow, you gave me this opal. You told me to keep it because I'd
need it some day. And Buffy you gave me this clover." Xander told them.</p>

<p>"Great, Willow gives you precious stones and I give you grass." Buffy
mumbled. Willow smiled at Buffy's comment before continuing on.</p>

<p>"Was there anything else, any clues to what we are up against?" asked
Willow.</p>

<p>"No. That was all that happened." lied Xander. Until he figured out a
few things he wouldn't tell the two girls the rest.</p>

<p>Willow could tell that Xander was holding something back, but she
didn't push it for the moment. For now she was happy to have her best friend
back. They all just sat and contemplated. Xander gave a little chuckle.</p>

<p>"What?" Buffy asked him.</p>

<p>"It's just this memory thing. I remember everything. Every class,
every math text book, every lesson I ever sat through. And you know what?" he
asked them.</p>

<p>"What?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"I'm really pissed that this had to happen AFTER my SAT's." They all
laughed at the thought.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>While the other three were talking in the lounge, David and Giles were
deep in conversation.</p>

<p>"Ok. Explain this War Of The Six. I haven't come across this in any of
my books." Giles told David.</p>

<p>"Of course it's not in any of your books. It's not in any book.
Writing has been around for what? 8 or 10 thousand years. This prophecy is 10
times older than that. Six people, The Chosen One and 5 others to protect
her, will fight a vampire army. If they loose then hell comes to earth. The
War Of The Six marks the beginning of turmoil in the forces of good and evil
and of humanity. At the end of the turmoil there is to be a final battle. The
battle to decide who shall rule the earth, good or evil. But this will only
occur if the War Of The Six is won by good.</p>

<p>"From what we saw it looks like, the War Of The Six takes place here
in Sunnydale. That hill looks like the one I took Xander to."</p>

<p>"The eclipse!" Giles raced to a book shelf and started to leaf through
an almanac.</p>

<p>"When is the next eclipse due?" David asked his father. Giles looked
up from the book.</p>

<p>"Six weeks. The next total solar eclipse in Sunnydale is in six
weeks." Giles informed his son gravely. David exhaled. They had a little bit
of time to organise.</p>

<p>"Ok. So we know that in six weeks, Murg Dor will unleash an army for
vampires to open the gates of hell by killing the Chosen One, who will be
protected by 5 others. The question is who is the Chosen One?" David asked.</p>

<p>"I think it would be safe to assume that Buffy is the Chosen One."
Giles said.</p>

<p>"Ok. Buffy is the Chosen One. I take that Willow, Xander and you will
fight with her. I'll be there, so that leaves us with needing one other
person. Who?" David and Giles thought for a while. Giles had a thought.</p>

<p>"What about Spike? He has fought for Buffy." Giles put forward. David
shook his head.</p>

<p>"No. Murg Dor can control demons and vampires, remember? No. It needs
to be a person. Skilled at fighting. Strong." David grew silent. A thought
slowly entered his head.</p>

<p>"I'll talk to Albert." David said. Giles looked at David incredulously.</p>

<p>"You can't be serious. Fine, Albert has got powerful magic but the man
is 100 for heavens sake!" Giles told him.</p>

<p>"No! I don't mean for him to fight. I need him to try to convince the
Watcher's Council to send us the other Slayer."</p>

<p>While David called Albert, Giles went into the lounge where Xander,
Buffy and Willow sat and explained what was going on.</p>

<p>"Do you really will send the other Slayer?" Buffy asked her Watcher.</p>

<p>"It would be foolish for them if they didn't. This danger is greater
than any other ever faced." Giles told them. The fact that he and Buffy had
defied the Council shouldn't preclude aid when it was needed. David entered
the room.</p>

<p>"Well, I called Albert and he'll put it to the Council tomorrow. He'll
let me know then." informed David.</p>

<p>"Fine, in the mean time we need to start planing.  David you can
start... " Giles started to say but David cut him off.</p>

<p>"No, no, no. You guys are gonna have to make all the plans without
this little black duck. I'm jet lagged to the shit house, so I'm off to bed.
I recommend you guys do the same. Once we know if we have the other Slayer,
then we can start planning. Ok?" David turned and went upstairs to bed.
Xander also got up.</p>

<p>"Just where do you think you are going?" Giles demanded to know.
Xander looked at him.</p>

<p>"The man has got a point. I'm heading for the kitchen for a snack,
then I'm hitting the hay G-man." Xander said and left. Giles just sighed.</p>

<p>"Fine. We'll do this tomorrow."</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Willow woke at dawn. Gently she untangled herself from Buffy's embrace
and softly padded down the stairs to the entertainment room. She stopped at
the door.</p>

<p>She could see David was watching a movie. On closer inspection, it was
'Romeo+Juliet' and was very near the end. Unnoticed by David she saw him
flinch when the gunshot rang out, ending Claire Danes' life with her Romeo.
To her amazement, tears rolled down David's cheeks; a look of total sadness
on his face at the death of the star struck lovers. David looked away from
the screen and saw Willow standing in the door way.</p>

<p>"Willow!" David said, frantically trying to wipe away the tears before
she noticed. "What are you doing up so early?" he asked, trying to cover up
his weak moment. Willow sat down beside him.</p>

<p>"David, it's Ok. It's good to express your emotions every now and
then." she said in her gentle voice she used sometimes to comfort Xander.
David just grumbled and looked at his feet.</p>

<p>"So. Let me guess. You really love Claire Danes as Juliet, right?" She
asked. David looked at her.</p>

<p>"Yeah. I do. The seen where she and Leo see each other through the
fish tank is just so... so... well I don't know a word for it. And her
costume, you know the angel one? It is spot on. She is an angel." David said.
Willow smiled.</p>

<p>"I would have never picked you for a guy who was into romance
stories." Willow said to him.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I am. I've got a stash of books and movies of my favourites."
He stopped, realising what he said. "You even breathe a word of what I just
said to any one, ever, I will make you very sorry." said David. Willow just
giggled.</p>

<p>"Ok. Your secret dies with me." she said. The pair sat in comfortable
silence.</p>

<p>"Willow." he said.</p>

<p>"Yes?" she replied.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry." David said sadly.</p>

<p>"For what? She asked.</p>

<p>"Everything. I'm sorry that I hurt you and Buffy. I'm sorry that we
aren't friends. I really envy Xander. He has these wonderful people who love
and care for him. I would give anything for that. I really wish we could be
friends. You guys are great." David said, a sad and wistful tone to his
voice. Willow raised one eye brow.</p>

<p>"Really? Even Buffy?" she asked. He grudgingly nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes. Even her. It's just hard, you know? We get on each other's
nerves. I don't mean to, I don't want to, but we do. We got off on the wrong
foot and it went down hill from there. We both share a lot in common. But,
well, I guess it ain't going to happen. All I ever wanted from you guys is to
be your friend." Willow took his hand.</p>

<p>"Well, how about you and I being friends? What do you say?" David
smiled at the red haired wicca.</p>

<p>"I'd love that." he said. His stomach growled, telling them both of
the need for breakfast. He got up.</p>

<p>"How about I start fixing breakfast?" he said with a bit of a flourish.</p>

<p>"Cool. Buffy and Xander won't be up for a while yet." she said and
turned to head for a shower. David stopped her.</p>

<p>"Willow." he said in a serious voice.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"It is vital that you guys trust Xander. He has info that is vital in
the up coming days. You need to trust that Xander will make decisions that
are for the best. Remember, you guys are the centre of the universe to him."
he said then left, leaving Willow to ponder what was said.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>It was around noon before the phone rang. David answered it in the
library. He came into the lounge room where everyone waited.</p>

<p>"Well?" Xander asked him. "Do we get the other Slayer or not?"</p>

<p>"Not quite." he told them</p>

<p>"What?" shot Buffy.</p>

<p>"Look, Albert said that the Council will allow us to put the case to
the full Council in person in 5 days time." David informed them.</p>

<p>"You mean to say that they want us to go to London to beg them for the
other Slayer?" Giles asked somewhat dismayed.</p>

<p>"Yeah. Look, it's much better than them saying no. I think we don't
have a lot of choice here. I have to make some calls and organise a few
things." said David who left the room.</p>

<p>"Great. The Council wants us to go begging for help. Wonderful."
Xander said rolling his eyes. Buffy turned to Giles.</p>

<p>"Do you really think that this is necessary?" she asked the former
Watcher.</p>

<p>"Buffy, we don't have any choice. We need the other Slayer." Giles
told her, unhappy at the prospect. The four of them continued to grumble
about the matter until David came back.</p>

<p>"Ok. It's arranged. Everyone pack because we head out this afternoon
for London." David told them.</p>

<p>The 747 touched down at Gatwick airport in the early hours of the
morning. The British Airways jet disgorged its passengers, including the
Slayer and her friends who emerged from first class.</p>

<p>"Xander, I can't believe you vomited on the floor. In first class, for
heavens sake!" Giles said rather testily.</p>

<p>"Hey! I haven't flown before. Plus that turbulence we hit over
Iceland, well, no man should have to go through that." Xander complained.</p>

<p>"Yeah, but you know they have airsickness bags for a reason you know."
Buffy told her friend.</p>

<p>"True, but Xander here thought that were for storing the air line food
that I refused to eat." David informed them.</p>

<p>"Hey! It was a long flight! I might have gotten hungry later on."
Xander protested at the extended pick on Xander session. David rolled his
eyes at the comment.</p>

<p>"Xander, you want to know what a long flight is? Try the Sydney to
London or the Sydney to LA non stop flights. 22 ass numbing, brain damaging
hours. Every minute designed to burn the humanity right out of a person."
informed David. They stopped at the baggage terminal.</p>

<p>"Right, we'll find our luggage. Xander, go find us a couple of taxis."
Giles told him. Xander left in the general direction of the exit. David
looked at his father.</p>

<p>"You are aware that the hotel has a mini bus waiting for us to take us
there?" he asked his father.</p>

<p>"Yes. But Xander doesn't." Giles said, a smile edging from his lips.
David laughed.</p>

<p>"You are a truly evil man, Rupert Giles." David said.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The gang made it to the hotel and checked into their rooms. Giles had
a room to himself which connected to the room that David and Xander shared.
Buffy and Willow shared a room across the hall. David and Xander dumped the
huge pile of luggage into Buffy and Willow's room. Giles entered a moment
later, puffing as he struggled with a pair of bags. Willow and Buffy walked
in after him. Trying to get his breath back, Giles pointed at Xander.</p>

<p>"Next time... you offer... to carry the... girls bags,... count... me
out." Giles told the young man.</p>

<p>"Come on Giles, it's the proper and decent thing to do." Xander smiled
at his revenge for the taxi thing.</p>

<p>"Speaking of decent" David said, indicating to the room. "Girls. You
will notice that there are two single beds which" he grabbed one and tried to
move it. "Cannot be brought together. So you'll just have to cool your
hormones for a few days." David said with a cheeky grin. Willow just looked
at the beds, a coy smile on her face.</p>

<p>"I don't know. Single beds mean that we just have to snuggle together
more closely." Willow said. Buffy looked at the fire place.</p>

<p>"Also that big rug by the fire place has definite possibilities."
Buffy said. David and Xander just stood there, dreamy smiles on their faces
as the images invoked flashed through their minds. Giles just coughed and
spluttered for a bit.</p>

<p>"Right then I'll be in my room were there is no talk of sex." Giles
said turning for his room. David chuckled.</p>

<p>"OK. Why don't we meet down in the lobby in, say, two hours?" David
suggested. They agreed and went into their respective rooms to unpack.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>They all met in the lobby where David informed them what was planned
for the day.</p>

<p>"You guys need to go shopping for some clothes." he told them.</p>

<p>"Why? What kind of clothes?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"For tonight, you'll need dresses for the ball. Dad, Xander, you guys
need to go to this address for a fitting. I've arranged for you have your
clothes tailor made." David said handing over a card with an address on it.
Willow looked at David quizzically.</p>

<p>"Ball? What ball?" she asked him.</p>

<p>"The ball that we are going to tonight. Relax. You guys will have a
blast." he said.</p>

<p>"Hello. Problem. We are just a pair of college students here. How are
we going to afford to pay for said dresses?" asked Buffy. David reached into
his pocket and pulled out 4 credit cards and handed one to each of them.</p>

<p>"Keep these. The credit limit is $750 000 per month and don't worry,
the bill gets settled at the end of each month by someone else." he said to
the disbelieving stares of everyone.</p>

<p>"How? Who?" Giles asked, stunned. David merely smiled.</p>

<p>"Let's just say that I have a very special understanding with a couple
of banks." he told them.</p>

<p>"Ok. Everyone meet back here at 4pm. We will get ready and head off to
the ball around 6. Any questions?" asked David. Xander put his hand up.</p>

<p>"Yeah, just one. Where are you going to be?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"Me? I'm going to see a man about a dog." replied David.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Later that day.</p>

<p>"So, we are agreed then gentlemen?" the men around the table nodded
their assent. The man at the head of the table stood and shook David's hand.</p>

<p>"Major, you have got your self a deal. I'll get some copies made and I
give you one tonight at the ball." the man said.</p>

<p>"Thank you sir. It will be a pleasure." David said smiling.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>It was 4 o'clock and the gang were in Giles' room discussing the day.
Buffy and Willow had gone on an epic shopping spree. Not only had they bought
ball gowns, but had bought an entire new wardrobe each, with accessories.
Buffy considered that if David was stupid enough to give them credit cards
then it was her duty to use them to the full.</p>

<p>Giles and Xander had been a little more restrained on the credit
cards. Once they finished being measured for their out fits, Giles took
Xander to show some of his old stomping grounds. They too did some clothes
shopping, with Giles making sure that Xander got some decent clothes for a
change and Xander making sure that Giles didn't even look at tweed. They
finished up at Giles' old pub, The Duke Of Kent.</p>

<p>There was a knock on the door which was the porter bringing in the
clothes for the ball. Buffy and Willow left to get ready while David helped
Xander and Giles. Giles and Xander could not believe the clothes they had for
the ball.</p>

<p>"We can't wear these!" Giles insisted, indicating to his and Xander's
clothes. Or more rather, uniforms. Giles had the mess dress of a Royal Air
Force Wing Commander while Xander had the mess dress of a United States Army
Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"We can't wear this. We aren't in the military!" Giles hissed at
David. David sighed in frustration.</p>

<p>"Look, the ball is at HM Naval Base Portsmouth. It is easier to blend
in if you are military. That way people will not ask too many questions." he
said.</p>

<p>"Yes. But what about the questions they do ask? Xander and I don't
know the first thing about the military." Giles protested. Xander spoke up.</p>

<p>"Giles, it's cool. I remember all that army guy stuff from Halloween."
Xander said.</p>

<p>"That's all right for you but what about me?" Giles persisted.</p>

<p>"Look, if any one asks anything to do with the Air Force, all you have
to say is that you spent your career in intelligence at GCHQ. Then tell them
that since you retired you have been undertaking research in ancient history.
That way you can start talking about things you know about." David informed
Giles.</p>

<p>"Yes, but what if they keep asking me about what I did at this GCHQ?"
Xander handled that one.</p>

<p>"That's the beauty of it Giles. As soon as you mention intelligence
and GCHQ, it all falls into the category of 'need-to-know'. They don't need
to know so they won't ask anything more." Xander explained. Giles grumbled a
little more but gave up and started to get ready.</p>

<p>When they met the girls to go, it took another ten minutes of
convincing them that it was a good idea. They headed off with only Xander
thinking this was a good idea. Everyone else had reservations about David's
scheme.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>To the general amazement of everyone, they weren't arrested. Instead
they entered the great hall where the ball was in full swing. They wandered
through the crowd until David saw who he was looking for.</p>

<p>"Admiral Michaels, sir. Would you care to meet my guests?" David asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly, Major McWray." The Admiral said pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Admiral, I would like to introduce Wing Commander Rupert Giles, RAF
retired." The Admiral shook Giles' hand.</p>

<p>"A pleasure. So, what did you do in the RAF?" The Admiral asked Giles.
Giles looked at David in a little panic.</p>

<p>"Um.. Intelligence. GCHQ. That kind of thing. Need to know." Giles
said somewhat uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"Oh, right you are. Sorry about that. So, what do you do now. If I may
enquire?" asked the Admiral.</p>

<p>"Well, I research ancient history. Kind of a hobby of mine for years."
Giles replied.</p>

<p>"Fascinating." The Admiral turned to Xander. "And who do we have
here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Alexander Harris. United States Army." Xander said.</p>

<p>"Where are you posted?" asked the Admiral.</p>

<p>"Fort Meade." he replied, indicating the US electronic spy agency head
quarters. The Admiral quickly moved to Buffy.</p>

<p>"And who is this lovely lady?" he asked. David answered for her.</p>

<p>"Buffy Summers. She's with the NSA." David told him. The Admiral moved
on to Willow, but before the Admiral could say anything Willow smiled and
said;</p>

<p>"Willow Rosenberg, CIA."</p>

<p>The Admiral took a step back and looked at David.</p>

<p>"Good heavens! You really have brought a nest of spies, haven't you?"
the Admiral said to David. A little smile escaped David's lips.</p>

<p>"Well, that would depend on wether or not the collective noun for a
group of spies is a nest." he told the British Admiral. Without thinking
Xander opened his mouth.</p>

<p>"In this case it's a Scooby of spies." Xander said absently. Xander
was deafened by the sound of five sets of eyes blinking at him. David
recovered quickly to cover Xander's little goof.</p>

<p>"You will have to excuse Lieutenant Harris here, sir. Even his fellow
Americans find his sense of humour as strange. Isn't that correct Wing
Commander?" David asked his father. It took a second or two for Giles to
realise that David was talking to him.</p>

<p>"Oh! Yes. Most strange." Giles affirmed. The Admiral nodded, not quite
sure what to make of this motley crew.</p>

<p>"Yes, well. You must excuse me, my wife seems to want to have a word
with me. A pleasure to meet you all, and may you enjoy our hospitality." said
the Admiral as he made a bee line for his wife. After he had left, Buffy
whacked Xander on the arm.</p>

<p>"A Scooby of spies? What planet is you brain on?" she asked him.
Rubbing his arm, Xander frowned at Buffy.</p>

<p>"It just slipped out! Besides" Xander rounded on David. "What's with
the 'even his fellow Americans regard his sense of humour as strange'?"</p>

<p>"Look, I know the Admiral. He looks upon Americans as strange but
likeable cousins and Australians as crude but endearing. He's just a bit old
fashioned and needs a little understanding. Besides, now that's over with,
you lot should be out there enjoying the pomp and glamour of the ball. Now
shoo!" he said motioning for them to go. "Eat, drink, and be merry!" David
told them and them walked away towards the bar table. Giles blinked and then
smiled. He offered his arm to Buffy.</p>

<p>"May have this dance, Miss Summers?" he asked his Slayer in a way that
only an English gentleman could. A huge grin broke out on the Slayers face.
She took the offered arm.</p>

<p>"Most certainly, kind sir." she said and the pair headed off to the
dance floor. Willow and Xander watched them go. Xander turned to his friend.</p>

<p>"How about it Wills? Wanna dance?" he asked.</p>

<p>"OK. But no funny stuff, mister." she said in mock seriousness.</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I wouldn't want the NSA to hunt me down and stake me,
would I?"</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The night was fantastic. The pomp, the glamour, the air of refinement
charmed the gang and the ride back to the hotel was full of talk about it.
The following days were full of sight seeing and shopping. Before they knew
it, the day that they had to appear before the Council had arrived.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The country manor that they had arrived at served as the headquarters
of the Watcher's Council. They were met by a smiling Albert.</p>

<p>"Rupert!" Albert cried and vigorously shook his hand. "You look so
well my friend!" Albert told Giles. Albert looked at Buffy.</p>

<p>"And I take it you are Buffy." Albert said with a grandfatherly smile.
Buffy took a liking to the old man right away.</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes I am." she said, a little smile covering the nerves she felt
at being here.</p>

<p>"Don't worry my child. You have many friends on the Council. Not all
of us approved your Watchers removal." he told her. He went onto Willow and
Xander.</p>

<p>"This must be Willow and Xander then. It is good to see the Slayers
friends being here for her." Albert said. He motioned for them to follow him.</p>

<p>They entered the manor and headed for the auditorium where the Council
had gathered to hear Buffy and her friends. Buffy stopped before the doors.</p>

<p>"What's the procedure here?" she asked Albert.</p>

<p>"Well, the Chief Watcher and the High Council will be sitting a the
table at the front of the room and the General Council will be seated as the
audience. You and Rupert will stand before the High Council and make you
case. The High Council and the General Council will then meet and decide.
Fear not, child. Many of the General Council share your concern and I think
that they might be able to persuade the High Council to grant your request."
Albert informed her. Buffy took a deep breath. She knew that she could
persuade the Council. The old man motioned to two young men standing by the
huge doors leading to the auditorium who opened them. Buffy and the rest
entered.</p>

<p>Everyone turned as they entered the room. At the end of the room was a
dozen men seated behind a large table. A man seated in the middle of the
table, presumably the High Watcher, spoke.</p>

<p>"Buffy Summers. Rupert Giles. Please come forward." he said. Buffy and
Giles went forward and stood before the High Council. The High Watcher looked
at them closely.</p>

<p>"You stand here today, requesting the other Slayer be sent to
Sunnydale in order to battle this Murg Dor demon. The High Council and I have
considered this request and we refuse your request." Buffy and her friends
were shocked.</p>

<p>"Further more, it is the judgement of the High Council that both of
you are to be punished for your defiance of the Council. The punishment shall
be death."</p>

<p align=right><a class=link href="#top">Top</a></p>

<table cellspacing=0 width=100%>
<tr><td class=h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 25</td></tr>
</table>

<p>There was a chorus of out cries at the judgement from the General
Council. They were here to listen to the Slayer's request, not to witness her
death. The Chief Watcher called for silence. Buffy stood defiant before the
High Council.</p>

<p>"What makes you think that you can stop me from walking out of here?"
she said, her voice low and dead serious. The Chief Watcher made a motion
with his hand and a young Watcher produced a pistol. Instantly there was a
flurry of motion which revealed Xander pointing a machine pistol at the young
Watcher. Xander was all business. His protective instincts towards Buffy and
Giles coupled with his training, meant that any wrong movement on the young
Watcher's part would be instantly fatal.</p>

<p>The General Council was shocked at the production of guns into the
meeting. David strolled up to the table where the High Council sat. He gave
them a smile that reminded Buffy of the cruel smile that Angelus gave when he
was enjoying a really bad moment. Without taking his eyes off the High
Council, he spoke.</p>

<p>"Albert, I'm guessing you would like to say a few words right about
now. Why don't you share them with us?" David said. The old man stood, his
eyes burning with anger at the High Council.</p>

<p>"I bring the Slayer here in order for her to ask for our help.
Instead, you already dismiss her request out of hand and then put a death
sentence on her and her Watcher..." the Chief Watcher leapt to his feet and
interrupted.</p>

<p>"He is no longer her Watcher!" the Chief Watcher said firmly.</p>

<p>"She is the Slayer and he is her Watcher!" Albert said defiantly.</p>

<p>"Shut up and sit down you ignorant black savage!" the Chief Watcher
yelled at the old man. A hand grabbed the Chief Watcher by the throat and
lifted him clear of the table. It was David.</p>

<p>The look that David gave the Chief Watcher was truly terrifying. No
overt displays of anger, just a look that was cold, hard and frighteningly
calm. It was clear to all that the Chief Watcher's life was a hairs breadth
away from being violently ended. David would kill the Chief Watcher with
little more compunction than stepping on a bug.</p>

<p>"Apologise to Albert. Or else." David said in a monotone voice. There
was no need to explain the 'or else'.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry." The Chief Watcher choked out as David slowly cut off his
air. David released the man.</p>

<p>"Good. Now there will be no punishment of the Slayer or her Watcher.
While she and I don't like each other much, I have the deepest respect for
her and realise how vital she is to this world. As for her Watcher, well, him
being my father should be explanation enough. Now, Albert, I believe you were
saying something before you were rudely interrupted." said David. Albert
stood before the General Council and addressed them.</p>

<p>"A Slayers' duty is to fight the forces of evil and slay vampires. A
Watchers' duty is to train her, guide her and aid her in the performance of
her sacred duty. The Watchers Council has a duty to train, aid and monitor
the Watcher in his duty. What we have seen here today is a demonstration of
this Councils' betrayal of its' duties. The High Council sacked her Watcher
for trying to stop an old fashioned and barbaric test. It then brings her and
her Watcher in under false pretences to kill them. To kill the Slayer.</p>

<p>"I have studied the Watchers Diaries of 416 Watchers and their
Slayers. Of those 416, the average life span of the Slayer is 18. 137 Slayers
have faced apocalyptic events. All were successful at adverting the
apocalypse but only 10 survived the battle. Of those 10, 2 have faced two or
more apocalyptic events. Buffy Summers is the only surviving one of them.</p>

<p>"Buffy Summers is the most successful Slayer in recorded history. What
makes her different? She is stronger physically than most other Slayers, but
not massively so. Is it the support she has received from the Council? Most
certainly not. What is it then? I say it is the support she receives from her
Watcher and her friends. The love, the care, the reassurance that she will
never go into battle alone. That is what makes her different. That is what
makes her so successful." Albert said to the General Council. They hung on
his every word.</p>

<p>"This Council, this Watchers Council, has the attitude that the Slayer
works for the Council. In reality, the Council should work for the Slayer.
Things have changed over the centuries. No longer are Slayers illiterate
peasant girls of the dark ages. The are highly educated, wise to the modern
world, and demanding of a life as normal as is possible.</p>

<p>"This Council, this Watchers Council, has failed in its duties to the
Slayer. I propose the formation of a new council, The Slayers Council, a
council mindful of its duties and able to adapt to today's modern world."
Albert looked about the stunned Watchers.</p>

<p>"Who will stand with me, who will stand behind the Slayer?" he asked
them. Silence. Then the figure of Sam Zabuto stood and walked up to Buffy. He
gently put his hand on the Slayers shoulder.</p>

<p>"I lost my Slayer, my Kendra, in the fight against vampires. I trained
her in the manner of which the Council dictated. I held myself above her
emotional needs and attempted to remove her emotions, lest they make her
weak. I was wrong. My mistake cost her, her life. A few days after I was told
of her death, I realised just how much she meant to me. But it was too late.
She never knew how I felt. She was like a daughter to me. I know that many
Watchers feel that way about their Slayers, but usually it is only after her
death do they realise it." Sam Zabuto looked at Buffy, a sad but determined
look on his face.</p>

<p>"I stand with you, Slayer. For you, for future generations of Slayers,
for my Kendra." said Sam. Buffy smiled at the Watcher, grateful at his
support. She too had fond memories of Kendra and the bond that they shared.
She then looked around at the General Council.</p>

<p>One by one, then in small groups, Watchers took their place behind
Buffy and Giles. In the end, over half of the General Council stood with her.
The vast majority of them were Watchers from outside England. Giles smiled a
triumphant smile.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen" he said to a shocked High Council "with no further
business, this meeting is closed." said Giles and turned for the doors.</p>

<p>"Just one more thing." David said, reaching into his jacket and
pulling out a piece of paper.</p>

<p>"This is an agreement between the Australian, US, British, and other
major governments which guarantees protection and aid to the Slayer and her
associates. It reads 'any interference or threat to the Slayer or her
associates by any individuals or groups shall be deemed by all nations as a
threat to national and international security, and as such, it shall be dealt
with accordingly'." David put the paper away. "I would think about that
gentlemen if I were you." David said to the High Council.</p>

<p>He then turned and with Albert, Buffy and Giles, lead the new Slayers
Council out of the manor. Once everyone was out, Willow summed up the whole
event.</p>

<p>"Holy shit!"</p>

<p>The next few days were so hectic that they were a blur. The new
Slayers Council began setting up and elected Albert to head it. Both the
Watchers Council and the Slayers Council had a Slayer. Buffy and the rest of
the gang returned to Sunnydale to continue with the preparations for the up
coming War Of The Six. The Slayers Council along with Giles and Willow
researched more into Murg Dor and spells that could be used in the battle
against him and his army. Buffy, Xander and David trained together; while
neither David or Buffy would ever admit it, they learnt from each other in
the rare moments that they were not pissing each other off. There was only
one major question that hadn't been answered. Who would be the sixth person
in the war.</p>

<p>With the split within the Watchers Council, the second Slayer was
under the control of the Watchers Council and would not be part of the war.
At various times, everyone asked David who would take the second Slayers
place. All were told the same thing.</p>

<p>"Don't worry. I've got it fixed." David knew what was going to happen,
not all of what was going to happen, but enough to know what he had to do.
All he could do was wait for events to unfold. Three weeks from the war, the
first event in the chain reaction foretold happened.</p>

<p>Buffy and Willow were patrolling when they were ambushed by a group of
demons. The fight was fierce, too fierce. The fight had reached its peak when
David and Xander, who were patrolling separately from Buffy and Willow,
showed up. It was at that point that one demon ran Buffy through with its
dagger. Xander and David finished off the demons while Willow tended to Buffy.</p>

<p>The wound was deep and was so close to her heart. Buffy's lungs were
filling with blood. Willow was frantic. Her lover was dying before her eyes.
Willow cried and begged Buffy not to die. David and Xander rushed to the
fallen Slayers side. David quickly examined the wound. He looked into
Willow's tearful eyes.</p>

<p>"We can save her. But I need your help, I can't do this with out you."
David told the grief stricken Wicca.</p>

<p>"Anything! Just save her!" Willow cried out.</p>

<p>"I need to draw upon your power and combine it with mine so we can
heal her. It's risky but it's the only way to save her." David said.</p>

<p>"I don't care how risky it is! Let's just do it!" Willow nearly
shouted at the young man.</p>

<p>David took Willow's hands in his and closed his eyes. He began
speaking in the language of his people and a white light formed around their
hands. He then lowered their hands over the wound. Buffy and Willow screamed
as the light flared and David chanted louder. The wound glowed white then
closed over. Exhausted, David let go of Willow's hands and grew silent.
Willow nearly fainted beside Buffy while Xander looked on, fear blazing in
his eyes. Fear for Buffy, for Willow, for the world should Buffy die.</p>

<p>Buffy sat up and examined the wound. It was gone, save a small scar.
With the help of Xander she stood up and helped Willow up. All three looked
at David who was still knelling on the ground.</p>

<p>"What did you do to me?" Buffy asked in a hushed tone. David slowly
looked up at the Slayer, a look of incredible age on his face.</p>

<p>"I combined my power and Willow's power to call upon the Chimea
spirits to heal you. It was risky, the spirits might have killed me for
disturbing their slumber, but I had to do it. If you die before the War Of
The Six then the world is lost." David got to his feet.</p>

<p>"Come back to my place. There is other things that we need to decide
on." David said. They all walked in silence back to David's place where Giles
met them.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"I can't just stop patrolling for three weeks! The death toll in this
town is high enough." Buffy forcefully told he Watcher. Giles, upon hearing
of Buffy's close call, decided that until the war, Buffy should refrain from
patrolling. He paced about, deep concern on his face.</p>

<p>"Buffy, if you die then the world will die. We can't risk losing you."
he said to her.</p>

<p>"Giles!" Buffy exclaimed. Up until now only Buffy and Giles had
spoken. Now David stepped forward.</p>

<p>"I think I have a solution. It's risky and neither of you will like it
much." he said in a quiet reasonable tone. Buffy and Giles looked him.</p>

<p>"Well? What's this big bad solution?' Buffy demanded to know. David
paused for a few moments before speaking.</p>

<p>"It's an Aboriginal ritual. It confers a limited invulnerability to
the recipients. But its got a couple of risks and drawbacks." he told them.</p>

<p>"Well, what are they?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"The ritual confers an invulnerability against injury from things not
of tooth or claw. Daggers, swords, bullets will not be able to harm you. It
will also have the effect of not allowing Murg Dor to cut you down in a hail
of arrows during the war. It won't stop a vampire from tearing you apart with
its hands or draining you. Basically it means that in order to kill you, they
have to get close enough for hand to hand combat.</p>

<p>"The ritual must be performed on the young, so I'm afraid that it
can't be done to you Dad." David told Giles sadly. David continued.</p>

<p>"If I'm going to do this then I would want Buffy, Willow, Xander and
myself to under go it. The ritual involves bringing about a soul messenger
forth from each person. This soul messenger then travels to that persons
soulmate."</p>

<p>"Soulmate?" Willow asked.</p>

<p>"It is an ancient belief that each person is created from a lump of
clay which is divided in two, each half becoming a person, each half being
the soulmate of the other. The soul messenger seeks out the soulmate. Once it
does then each person will know who and where their soulmate is. Then the
soulmates are brought into physical contact with each other and their souls
rejoin and become one. Regardless of where in the world your soulmate is you
will know where they are and I'll be able to get them here within 48 hours."</p>

<p>"So what's the risk?" Giles asked his son.</p>

<p>"The risk is that should the persons soulmate be dead, then the soul
messenger will also die, killing that person." There was silence as everyone
contemplated that thought. David turned to his father.</p>

<p>"I think that we should leave them so that they can discuss it, hey
Dad?" Giles nodded. As they left the room, David had one more thing to say.
He turned to Xander.</p>

<p>"Oh. By the way, the dress code is the same as last time." David
informed him then left. Willow looked quizzically at Xander.</p>

<p>"Dress code? What's the dress code?" she asked her friend. Xander
blushed, feeling awkward.</p>

<p>"Um... well... you see... there is none. You have to be naked as the
day you were born." he said.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The argument had been going on for almost 10 minutes. Buffy was
reluctantly for the ritual. Willow was against it, privately afraid that she
would lose Buffy to her soulmate. Xander had not said a word, deep in
thought. Finally he spoke up.</p>

<p>"Willow, I think that we should do the ritual. It's the only way that
we can have any chance." he said. Willow rounded on him.</p>

<p>"No! No way Xander! We shouldn't risk it! There has to be a better
way!" she yelled at her friend.</p>

<p>"Will, this is the only way. Please trust me on this. Please." Xander
said in a calm soothing voice. Willow opened her mouth to speak then stopped.
She remembered what David had said that early morning. David's voice told her
to trust Xander, he knew what he was doing. She looked down at her hands.</p>

<p>"OK. Let's go through it." Willow reluctantly agreed.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The four of them gathered at the hill top where David and Xander had
gone to visit the Dreamtime Spirits. It was also the same hill top that the
War Of The Six would take place. Buffy, Willow and Xander had stared at each
other when they had removed their clothes. Xander could not believe how
beautiful the girls were and it took him supreme effort not to react
biologically. Buffy and Willow gawked at Little Xander, Buffy even going as
far as making a quiet remark to Willow.</p>

<p>"I thought we killed the Mayor?"</p>

<p>David, for his part was all business. He gathered them around the fire
where they began the ritual.</p>

<p>The ritual reached its peak. David's eyes glowed white, then a mist,
every colour of the rainbow, lifted from him and hovered over his head. The
soul messenger then disappeared into the night sky.</p>

<p>Xander, then Willow, then Buffy's eyes glowed white. Their soul
messengers floating above them in a slow dance of motion. Willow, first took
Buffy's hand with her left hand, then Xander's hand with her right. Xander
and Buffy held hands, completing the triangle.</p>

<p>It was then that David heard a tone. Clear, pure, perfect. It was the
same tone that he had heard when he had transferred Xander's pain and
emotions to the two girls. Above their heads the three soul messengers
twisted about each other. They fused in a dazzling flash of light, then
disappeared. David stared at them in shock and awe.</p>

<p>"Oh my God!" David breathed. "Trinity!"</p>

<p>"What the hell do you mean they are Trinity?" Giles demanded to know.
David looked at Buffy, Willow, and Xander who were curled up on the couch
together fast asleep. The ritual had taken a lot out of everyone and no
sooner had the three sat down they fell asleep.</p>

<p>"There is a legend that one day there will be three people with one
soul known as Trinity. Together they will be a powerful force and lead the
forces of good. In the ritual, their souls became one. They are Trinity. God!
It explains so much!" David exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Explains what?" asked Xander who had woken up. Buffy and Willow were
still asleep.</p>

<p>"Like how you three are so tangled up emotionally. Like how come Buffy
has faced the apocalypse so often." David told Xander.</p>

<p>"What has them being Trinity have to do with the apocalypse?" Giles
asked his son.</p>

<p>"Look. For eons, the fight between demons and humans has generally
favoured demons. With the exception of the Slayer and a handful of others,
humans have been incapable of fighting demons on anything like equal terms.
Now with the advance in technology, demons run the risk of being wiped out.
Human weapons are becoming more and more lethal to demons, and demons by
their nature cannot adapt to these new weapons. It won't be too long before
only the most powerful magical demons will be able to attack humans without
fear of being vaporised." said David.</p>

<p>"Like phasers on Star Trek?"  enquired Xander.</p>

<p>"Yes. With one of those babies, one person could wipe out legions of
demons and vampires. Shit, demons and vampires are already in trouble because
of Match Head bullets.</p>

<p>"So you combine advancing technology and the arrival of Trinity, it
means that demons must win now or humans will eventually win. Quickest way of
winning for demons is to bring about the apocalypse. That's why you guys have
faced it so often. For demons it's now or never." David explained. There was
a minute or two of silence as they thought it through.</p>

<p>"OK then, what do we know about this Trinity?" Giles asked. David
shrugged and went to the library. He returned with a pile of books.</p>

<p>"You guys start looking in the Althos Works, I'll start with the
Chronicles of Golgotha." he said as the three of them started researching.
Twenty minutes later, David spoke.</p>

<p>"Proeliator consisto lumen, custos cretatus, veneficus consisto
flamma, voluntas fieri modus. Tunc vinculum mos consisto scelratus." David
read from the Chronicles of Golgotha. He had not had a chance to read it
since stealing it from the Vatican Black Library, something that he truly
regretted now.</p>

<p>"Well? In English?" Xander asked.</p>

<p>"Warrior of light, guardian in white, witch of flame, will be bond.
And then the bond will be formed with blood." David roughly translated.</p>

<p>"Still not getting it." Xander said. Giles took his glasses off and
began cleaning them as he explained.</p>

<p>"The warrior of light would refer to Buffy. Witch of flame is probably
Willow, which means that you are the guardian in white. You three will be
bond. Obviously it means the ritual. But I'm not sure what it means where it
talks about the bond will be formed with blood."</p>

<p>In that moment, David knew what it meant. The last piece had fallen
into place. David was as scared as he had ever been in his whole life. He
stood and walked out.</p>

<p>"David? Where are you going?" Giles asked. David stopped and turned.
The fear and sadness on his face evident.</p>

<p>"I just need to get some sleep. I'll see you both in the morning."
David said quietly and left.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>The next morning saw David and Xander, down in the armoury checking
weapons for the war.</p>

<p>"Xander? What's it like? You know, to be Trinity?" David asked. Xander
stopped what he was doing and thought for a few moments.</p>

<p>"It's hard to describe. There is all these strange feelings running
through me. It's like a heightened sense of awareness of Buffy and Willow. I
feel what they feel, and they feel what I feel. It's a connection deeper and
stronger than anything you could think of. Each of us has this connection
which goes beyond love or caring or any emotion. We are one with each other.
It's as if we had been living in a two dimensional world and now there is
this third dimension that we have suddenly become aware of." explained
Xander. David merely nodded and took it in. They resumed cleaning and
checking the weapons when Xander asked David a question that had bugged him
all morning.</p>

<p>"So, what about your soulmate?" David stopped briefly.</p>

<p>"Not coming." he said and resumed work.</p>

<p>"What do you mean 'not coming'? How could they be not coming?" Xander
insisted. David threw down the gun in anger.</p>

<p>"I mean that they can't come to me and I can't go to her! So just
leave it!" David yelled at Xander then stomped off. Xander watched his friend
go and wondered what it all meant.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Later that day, Xander discussed what had happened in the armoury with
Giles, Buffy and Willow.</p>

<p>"His soulmate can't be dead, otherwise David would have died last
night." Buffy pointed out.</p>

<p>"With all the resources of several governments behind him, you would
think that getting someone here would be easy." said Giles.</p>

<p>"I'm more worried about this sixth person we need for the War Of The
Six. David said he has it under control, but I'm not comfortable with that."
Willow said. Xander exhaled.</p>

<p>"Will, we just have to trust him in this." he said.</p>
