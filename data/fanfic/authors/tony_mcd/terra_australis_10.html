<!-- Terra Australis Incognito \ Part 10 -->

<p>The next morning Xander sat on Giles' sofa as Giles fixed some tea.</p>

<p>"So what's the deal, G Man?" asked Xander.</p>

<p>"I'm worried about things between you, Buffy and Willow." Giles said
sitting down across from Xander. Xander for his part looked uncomfortable
with the subject.</p>

<p>"Look, Buffy and Willow have gone off to college and that normally
puts a bit of strain on friendships. But it's no real big, Giles." Xander
said.</p>

<p>"Xander, I've noticed how this has effected you. Just because David,
Buffy and Willow don't get along doesn't mean that things between you and the
girls needs to be bad as well."</p>

<p>"Giles, things were bad before David showed up. Even in high school
they saw me as more of hindrance than a help. Then they went to college and I
didn't and they decided that they didn't need a loser like me any more."</p>

<p>"You are not a loser and they do need you. Together you three are a
powerful force for good. Things are bad now but they don't need to be. Please
go and talk to them. Explain how you feel and you'll find that they still
need you." Giles told the young man.</p>

<p>"Maybe." Xander mumbled.</p>

<p>"No, you will go right now and talk to them this instant!" Giles
barked. A little reluctantly Xander got up and left.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>Xander knocked on the door at Buffy and Willow's dorm. After he got no
answer, he wandered down to the common room where he saw the two girls
sitting with their backs to him talking. They were alone in the common room
and hadn't noticed Xander enter. He stopped to listen in on their
conversation.</p>

<p>"I saw David the other night at the pub. He had one of Xander's shirts
on, can you believe it?" Buffy asked.</p>

<p>"God! Not only is David a loser, he wears another losers shirt as
well." Willow chimed. Xander paled.</p>

<p>"Between GI Joe try hard David and Xander, King of Losers it's enough
to make a woman vomit." Buffy told her lover.</p>

<p>I know, it's hard to believe that I actually loved Xander once. Thank
heavens I came to my senses." Willow said rolling her eyes. Buffy smiled
seductively at Willow.</p>

<p>"Enough with talk of those idiots, give me sugar baby!" Buffy said.
Xander watched as Willow and Buffy started kissing and running their hands
over each others body. He backed out of the room then ran.</p>

<p>Pain. He felt nothing but pain as he ran. His soul, his heart had been
shattered, burnt and crushed. The two people he loved most, the two people he
would die to protect had just destroyed him. All the pain he had kept hidden,
years of pain of all that had ever hurt him now ran through his veins; the
feeling was like fire.</p>

<p>*No more.* He thought as he entered David's place. David was still at
the Initiative. He ran down to the armoury.</p>

<p>*It ends now. No more pain.*</p>

<p>He tried to open the armoury door but was so worked up that he
couldn't enter in the code. He looked around and saw an extension cord on the
work bench. Xander fashioned a crude noose and fastened it to the overhead
beam. Standing on the stool he placed the noose over his head and kicked the
stool over. He dropped a few inches and the cord tightened.</p>

<p>"WHAT THE FUCK!!!!" David yelled. David lifted Xander up and struggled
him out of the noose. Xander was fighting him, balling his eyes out.</p>

<p>"Let me die! Just let me die!" cried Xander as he curled up in a ball
on the floor. David picked him up and took him to the lounge room and put him
on the sofa. Xander began thrashing about and screaming. David kept him on
the sofa with one hand while he dialled the phone with another.</p>

<p>"Hello?" Giles said picking up the phone. He could hear the screaming
in the background.</p>

<p>"Dad! It's me! Come to my place right now! Xander tried to kill
himself!" David heard the phone being slammed as Giles bolted for the door.</p>

<p align=center>***</p>

<p>"What happened?" Giles asked as he entered the lounge room. Xander was
still thrashing about and moaning.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I came home to find him hanging himself. He's been like
this since I got him down. What could have caused this?"</p>

<p>Giles felt sick.</p>

<p>"I told him to go and talk to Buffy and Willow about their friendship"
Giles wanted to die. </p>

<p>"Something bad must have happened to the girls and Xander must have
found them." Giles said feeling dead inside.</p>

<p>"Xander! What happened? Tell us what happened!" David said shaking the
boy. Xander kept thrashing and moaning.</p>

<p>"It's no use, he can't tell us anything." David told his father.</p>

<p>"We need to know what happened!" Giles insisted. David ran a hand
through his hair in frustration.</p>

<p>"There is some magic I can use to find out. I opens a link between his
mind and mine. It will also have the effect of draining most of that emotion
from him." informed David.</p>

<p>"Is it safe?" Giles asked. He didn't want to lose both of them as well.</p>

<p>"For him, yes. For me, well, it's worth the risk." David said. </p>

<p>He closed his eyes and placed his hand on Xander's head. Instantly
David was assailed be pain. Xander's pain. He saw the reason for his pain,
all the hurt Xander had ever suffered. He years of abuse from his father, the
loss of friends. The betrayal from Buffy and Willow. Xander loved them more
than life itself and they had destroyed him. Xander was strong but they were
so close to his heart and soul that what they had done had destroyed him.
David screamed and pulled his hand away.</p>

<p>"What..." Giles started to say but David cut him off.</p>

<p>"Bitches! Buffy and Willow are alive!" David yelled. He got up and
went to the armoury. Xander was peaceful and sleeping now. David returned
with two pistols and his shoulder holster.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" Giles asked his son. David put on the holster
and started to check his guns.</p>

<p>"They did this to him! Those fucking bitches did this to him!" yelled
David as he holstered the weapons and put on a coat.</p>

<p>"Who did this? Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Buffy and Willow did this to him, Dad! I've fucking had it with those
two fucking bitches. Now they are going to pay." David said in a cold hard
murderous voice. He was gone before Giles could stop him.</p>
