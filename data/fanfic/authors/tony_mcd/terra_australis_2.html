<!-- Terra Australis Incognito \ Part 2 -->

<p>"The Slayer? What has she got to do with this?" David asked.</p>
<p>"It is a long story and I need to give you the background to it all. Some
of it you would have already been told. Some, you won't. Let's just say that
it is important enough for you to shut up and listen until I finish." Albert
grumped at David. David for his part was all ears. Albert began.</p>
<p>"We Aboriginals have creation stories like any other people. For us the
World was created by the Great Creation Spirit, the Rainbow Serpent. She
created the world and all living things, shaped the land and made it fit for
people to live on. She also created spirits who were to protect the land and
guide the people. Each spirit had a particular role, be it a sky spirit to
bring rain or a guiding spirit to lead people in the way that least harmed
the land. The Rainbow Serpent also gave free will to people and her spirits
to chose the path that they would follow.</p>
<p>"This free will enabled people and spirits to chose good or evil. Some
spirits decided that they would not serve the Rainbow Spirit who was now
sleeping to regain her strength after creating the world. Some spirits wanted
people to serve them, rather than the other way round. Some wanted to destroy
the world and reshape it as they saw fit. Others had their own agenda.</p>
<p>"So there was 2 camps of spirits, one good and one evil. And since good
was not really into fighting, evil dominated the world. The only thing that
stopped evil from destroying the world was the fact that evil was busy
fighting itself to determine who would rule. </p>
<p>"In the mean time good had decided that if they didn't get organised and
fight evil then evil would destroy them all. So the good spirits came
together and from which a number of spirits decided to become warriors for
good with the others providing what help they could.</p>
<p>"Eventually, after many great battles, good gained the upper hand over
evil. Good, however, lacked the power to destroy all evil. So they used what
power they had to lock as much of evil away from the world as possible. As
evil was removed one fed on a human and mixed his blood with the mans' blood.
That person fed on another human and mixed their blood together. Thus were
born vampires.</p>
<p>"The Rainbow Serpent awoke and saw the destruction wrought by evil. She
saw that vampires could very well mean the end of humans. She also saw that
evil will try to escape its prison. So, before she left the world, the
Rainbow Serpent created two warrior spirits to be placed in a man and a
woman. These two spirits would give the person that they were in great
strength, speed, and healing ability.</p>
<p>"The female spirit, Shelgui, would hunt vampires. When she died, the
spirit would goto another girl and continue the fight. She would become known
as the Slayer. The male spirit, Gangui, would enter a baby the moment it was
born. It would grow with the boy and become a powerful warrior. His destiny
was to prevent evil from destroying the world. Once the man was killed,
Gangui, would wait until he was next needed. Gangui is currently in you
David. Don't ask me why because I don't know, all I know is what I'm telling
you." Albert said anticipating David's inevitable question.</p>
<p>"Now we fast forward to the early 70's. I was in London, after having
been finally accepted into the Watchers Council. I wasn't a Watcher as such
as I didn't train a Slayer. Partly because I was already to old, partly
because I wasn't a born Watcher, and partly because there has never been a
Slayer born in Australia, as you know." David just nodded. He knew the
reasons well.</p>
<p>"I met this wayward character; hate-the-world, played rough, practiced
magic for self pleasure or gain. For some reason we became good friends. He
was rebelling against his destiny, he left Oxford and was doing anything to
avoid his destiny.</p>
<p>"You see his father was a Watcher, as was his father before him. He was
destined to become a Watcher and he rebelled against it. We were quite an odd
pair. He was fighting so hard to avoid becoming a Watcher and I had fought so
hard to become one.</p>
<p>"Anyway he was seeing a girl, my brother's grandaughter, who was over
there for a year on a working holiday. They ended up going their separate
ways when she went back to Australia. He later did a fooling and fatal thing.
He stopped rebelling and I helped him come to terms with what he did. I used
what influence I had to get him back into Oxford and for him to be trained as
a Watcher.</p>
<p>"My grand niece discovered she was pregnant to this lad when she returned
to Australia. She had a difficult labour and died not to long after giving
birth to a healthy baby boy.</p>
<p>"A few years ago the Slayer was drowned by a Master Vampire. She was
revived and she dusted the Master Vampire that did it. However, since she had
died another Slayer was called. Now there are two Slayers. The original who
died and another. From what I can tell, when the original Slayer died,
Shelgui moved onto the next girl but when the original Slayer was revived
Shelgui re-entered the original Slayer and left behind a daughter spirit. </p>
<p>"On her 18th birthday the Council did it's stupid test. She passed but
her Watcher was sacked for having a father's love for her. She then turned
around and told the Council to go fuck itself. She still slays and her
Watcher still guides and trains her.</p>
<p>"They are in Sunnydale. The original Slayer is Buffy Summers. Her Watcher
is the young man I met in London. He gave this ring to your mother before she
left." Albert held up a ring with a snake pattern on the outside. David
gasped.</p>
<p>"You mean..."</p>
<p>"Yes David. That man, the Slayer's Watcher, Rupert Giles, is your father."</p>
