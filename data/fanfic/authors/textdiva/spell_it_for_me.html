<p>Her name was music to her ears Ta-ra, Ta-ra, Ta-ra that synched with the percussion rhythm of her heart. Every time Willow saw her new gal pal Tara she felt as if&nbsp; Metalica's drummer Lars Ulrich were having a loud speedy performance inside her heart, she was afraid that her beats could be heard by Tara's ears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It haven't been long since they first meet at one of the Wican rendezvous, and from that day on&nbsp; they'd been inseparable, like oreos and milk. Some how Willow knew that this wasn't just a passing friendship, and that Tara wasn't going to replace Buffy's Best-Friend throne, this was different. She tried to dig back into her past and see if she ever felt this I-wanna-be-around-you syndrome with any other of her former forgotten friends... since nursery to college, but all she could recall were those love-hate cycles she had had with Cordelia, Faith and now Anya...now that she thought of it, more hate than love circled those names.</p>
<p>Willow didn't wanted to accept that what she felt for Tara was more than a friendship... She was even embarrassed to accept the revealing truth. How could she be attracted to another girl, if she had been straight her whole life? Willow sorted out the boys' names she had had crushes on to reassure her hetero-ness. But Tara's name jumped into her head and sparkled among the rest of them with glittery sparks. Every time she thought of Tara her stomach burned, she had to keep a Pepto bottle next to her night table, in her purse, in her mini-fridge, everywhere to ease the sensation.</p>
<p>Willow's phone rang, Buffy wasn't around, she was with Riley...(what a surprise!). She jumped to her&nbsp; feet and ran hoping it'd be the blond witch. </p>
<p>&quot;Hello?&quot;, her hopes crushed down when she heard a male voice. </p>
<p>&quot;Is this the 1-800-CUM-ON?&quot;, asked the voice in a needy way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;NO!&quot;, screamed Willow disgusted. </p>
<p>&quot;Hey but you have a sexy voice, maybe you could help me without charging me 2 dollars per minute.&quot; continued the man.</p>
<p>Willow heard some laughs from behind, she knew it had to be a prank call. &quot;Xander?&quot; questioned Willow as she heard Anya's dreadful incomparable voice calling him honey. &quot;Grow up!&quot; said Willow. </p>
<p>&quot;Loosen up Wills, what'ya doing?&quot;, Xander asked. </p>
<p>&quot;Well besides being your mock material...nothing, I was just&nbsp; resting&quot;, she said calming down.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I got a proposal you can't refuse... will you marry me?&quot;, Xander teased but was soon stopped by a kick from Anya. &quot;Hey hon, I was just kidding with Willow,... hey I was thinking if you'd like to go out with us to the Bronze tonight. I heard some pretty cool band is playing today,&quot; Xander finished.</p>
<p>Willow hesitated... she didn't wanted to spend the night in some place pretending to be having fun when all she wanted was to be with Tara, besides, she'd have to change, bloom herself with make-up.. take a shower, pour perfume.. that was way too much work not worth&nbsp; for going into a packed place that gave you as secondary effects: an empty wallet, alcohol breath, the feeling of loneliness, the feeling of killing Anya, being bumped with and by the cramming crowds and loosing your hearing impaired capacity with the band's loud lures. </p>
<p>Willow simply said, &quot;No thanks, I'd rather take some rest.. Have fun&quot;, and she hung up the phone, just then she starting thinking she was the Stupidest of them All.. Spending all that time talking to Xander (5 minutes) wouldn't let Tara's phone call come in.. she regretted not having call waiting at that moment. </p>
<p>The witches had spend their afternoon together, and had agreed on doing some spells on this Friday night. Willow was waiting for Tara to call. The phone rang, and it was...&quot;Tara?&quot;, asked Willow before even letting the other person talk. </p>
<p>&quot;Yes, how did you know it was me?&quot;, the blond one asked intrigued if Willow's power included phone call intuition. </p>
<p>&quot;Um Caller I.D.&quot;, said Willow not believing she'd said a lie to Tara.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;Um are you still on for tonight's plan?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, why, do you have any other plans?&quot;, asked Willow crossing her fingers in a masochistic way.</p>
<p>&quot;No.. never. However...&quot;</p>
<p>Willow interrupted her &quot;are you tired? cos if you are tired...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No... are you?&quot;, Tara was thinking that maybe Willow didn't want to come after all and that was killing her.</p>
<p>&quot;No... I am just fine!&quot;, confirmed Willow.</p>
<p>&quot;Well actually, I was thinking of changing plans... just a bit. Let me rephrase that, change the plans yet not the person. I still want to be with you.&quot;</p>
<p>Willow melted on the other side of the phone and went speechless.</p>
<p>&quot;Willow are you still there, or did you become a narcoleptic?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Still here... I am just curious, what do you want to do then?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um I&nbsp; was thinking about catching a movie with you. You like movies don't ya?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, great idea.. I was actually going to suggest something like that, COs we are going to look like loser witches.. making spells on a Friday night? We need a rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, I'll pick you up in 10 minutes, okay?&quot;, Tara asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Great! Until then.&quot;, Willow sat there hoping to smell Tara's breath in the phone. She thought to herself that technology hadn't gone as far as people thought, no one had invented a phone that could make you smell the other person you were talking to... that would translate not only their voice but their smell... Then she laughed alone thinking that maybe that wasn't&nbsp; such a good idea after all, what about the people with bad breath... yucks. She ran into her closet to change her sloppy clothes.</p>
<p>As Willow decided what to wear, many questions popped into her mind, &quot;Was this a date? No it wasn't.. If 2 girls going to a movie was a date, then she'd have a pretty big record dating Buffy! No it wasn't a date.&quot; Some one knocked on the door. Tara had arrived sooner that she'd expect, and Willow was half naked.</p>
<p>&quot;Willow it's me. Open up&quot;, requested Tara in a gentle way.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.. wait a sec, I am almost naked!&quot; screamed Willow.</p>
<p>Tara thought that being naked shouldn't be an excuse not to open the door, but rather the reason for Willow to open it up. She longed to see Willow's skin and of course to touch it. Tara thought that she had to take this opportunity and make up an excuse for Willow to open the door instantly, &quot;Hey Willow I am peeing, I forgot to go home, please open up now.. I am begging you. Who cares if you are naked!&quot;, Tara thought she sounded pretty convincing.</p>
<p>Willow was in the meantime thinking that being naked might look like a sexual invite, Tara could think she was trying to seduce her... She quickly pulled on a shirt, and opened the door. Tara's eyes were a bit disappointed at Willow's clothful ensemble... she gave Willow a small kiss on the cheek as she stepped in. Tara saw that Willow's shirt wasn't all drawn down in the back so she helped her lowering the shirt. There it was. Willow thought that was soooooo cute. </p>
<hr size=1 color=black width=200>
<p>As they were in line waiting to get their turn, Willow began thinking what should be the right thing to do... buy Tara's ticket? If she did... then the date thing was official, but if she didn't maybe. </p>
<p>&quot;Can I have 2 adult tickets for the 8 p.m. Girl Interrupted&quot;, Tara said. She handed in the money for both.</p>
<p>&quot;No, let me get mine please&quot;, said Willow giving Tara the money. </p>
<p>&quot;Hey I want to invite you, please allow me!&quot; begged Tara with a sweet smile that Willow couldn't resist. </p>
<p>Before the film started, Tara and Willow enjoyed whispering close to each other's ears with the excuse that they didn't want to bother people with their loud voices. Willow found this very arousing, feeling Tara's breath in her ear have her goose bumps, good goose bumps. </p>
<p>&quot; I heard this film is soo good,&quot; said Tara, who many times got her mouth too close to Willow's neck and ears touching them with her cola wet lips. </p>
<p>&quot;Yeah.. me too. I am so glad you asked me to come with you&quot;, Willow said smiling and softly placed her right elbow in the same arm chair Tara had her left arm resting. Their elbows were aligned touching slightly, but touching anyhow.</p>
<p>As soon as Angelina Jolie's face was screened in the huge Imax, Willow and Tara commented simultaneously, &quot; I just love her!&quot;. They smiled at their synchronicity. </p>
<p>&quot;Oh God, I think my hand just numbed again&quot;, Tara complained. It was the first time Willow had heard her saying that her hand went numb... feet went numb, legs where numb, but she had never heard anyone say Oops-my-hand-went-numb again. Tara began to shake her left hand hoping that it would help her come back into her regular alive state. But it didn't, or so she said. Willow just stared at Tara's hand. </p>
<p>&quot;Can I do something? Maybe we should go to the bathroom and have you water it a bit, or put it into the drying heater, or into the toilet...&quot;, Willow joked.</p>
<p>Tara laughed at Willow's always funny remarks and she added, &quot;I think you can help me&quot;. </p>
<p>&quot;How? Just tell me&quot;, Willow said.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold my hand&quot;. Willow didn't question Tara's unnumbing technique, she was just glad that now they had their hands linked, and it felt warm and good. Tara smiled at Willow, and it seemed as if the movie were screened in Willow's face, COs the rest of the time, Tara just stared at her. Willow was thankful that it was dark, because she was red as an apple. Her red hair could probably match her skin at that moment.</p>
<p>Tara caressed Willow's hand with her thumb. Willow couldn't focus on the film anymore, she was concentrated on the action of their starring armchair. Tara bent her head next to Willow and whispered softly &quot;Thanks for giving me a hand with my hand&quot;. Willow twirled her head in Tara's direction before Tara's head was back into &quot;her place&quot;. Their noses touched and their lips were just a few inches away. They kept that position, enjoying each other's breath intoxicating them. Tara parted and then rested her head on Willow's shoulder. The red witch couldn't get her nose away from Tara's soft, silky blond hair... it smelled so good, like candy. </p>
<p>&quot;Does this bother you?&quot; asked Tara referring to the nestling of her head. </p>
<p>&quot;No, I actually like it&quot;, Willow couldn't believe she actually said that. This was very Anne Heche to her...</p>
<p>At some scene, Winona for some strange reason lip-locked Angelina, maybe because she was high or something. Both girls went mute when they saw the 2 girls on the screen fulfill their own hidden passion. </p>
<p>&quot;Have you ever done that?&quot;, Tara asked shyly not looking at Willow, she was afraid that her love could be seen in her eyes. </p>
<p>&quot;What? Getting high?&quot;, Willow said trying to evade the real issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;No kissing another girl&quot;, said Tara. She knew Willow had just pretended not to know.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I haven't yet. You?&quot;, asked Willow curiously, looking at Tara with the corner of her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet?&nbsp; That means you are planning on to..&quot; Tara's desire was mounting, her heart raced as if she had been jogging.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe. I don't know&quot; Willow wished she had the courage to say &quot;Yes, I want to kiss you, right here right now Tara, because I love you&quot;, but as usual there was always a divorce in the way she felt and the words that followed.</p>
<p>The movie had ended. None of them knew what had happened in that dark room. But they had grown closer. Tara hated herself ,for not coming up with a good excuse now that they were walking out of the theater to hold Willow's hand. She wanted to hold her sooo badly, especially after their short kissing questionnaire.</p>
<p>Willow told Tara that the least she could do was walk her back to her dorm, after all,Tara had been really nice buying her the ticket. </p>
<p>&quot;So it went good&quot;, said Willow nervously standing still in front of Tara's dorm. She wished she could go inside of Tara, of Tara's dorm, and well, also inside of Tara.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, we should do this more often.&quot; Tara said staring deep into Willow's green eyes. She had the crazy thought that the intense staring of her blue eyes with Will's greens could intersect their colors and make a brand new color, like she did in art class mixing the primary to get the secondary colors. (Oh wait.. those were other colors...)</p>
<p>&quot;Next time, I'll invite you, okay?&quot; Willow said.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay! Are you sure you don't wanna come inside and rest for a while before you head to your dorm?&quot; (God, I am the worst person making up excuses... it's not like she has to rest to head home, her dorm is a few baby steps away, not China!)</p>
<p>&quot;No thanks, I am tired&quot; (Why did I said that? My butt was sitting for 2 hours and I am tired? Sounds very couch potato, or worse, she's going to think I don't want to be with her anymore)</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, then. I'll see you tomorrow&quot; (Okay, tomorrow be now...Speed up hours!)</p>
<p>Willow gave Tara a little hug in appreciation (or love?) but wasn't sure how long could she stay hugging her before Tara would think that it was a long, suspicious hug. She wished that someone could staple them together in that position, it just felt very warm and cozy. </p>
<p>&quot;Please call me when you get to your dorm. Okay?&quot; , asked Tara smiling.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, sweet dreams Tar,&quot; (She's sooooo sweet, she's playing surrogate mom... God I hope she dreams about me!)</p>
<p>Willow walked into her room and found Buffy still awake with some pretty big tea eye bags... </p>
<p>&quot;Where were you? I was worried!&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I am sorry! I didn't know you had plans to use your bed today...!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay... I am also sorry Wills, I was just worried COs I meet Xander and he told me you were here all alone, so I came with Riley to cheer you up trying to make you come with us to the Bronze, but you weren't here. I tried calling Tara I got her answering machine. So where were you anyways?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I went to catch&nbsp; a movie&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like a date?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No... Alone actually.&quot; (I can't believe I just lied to Buffy)</p>
<p>&quot;You should've told me and I would've gone with you Wills... it's been a while since you and me... in&nbsp; the dark... and popcorn!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know... but tonight I just wanted to be on my own&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, I understand. I am just glad to know you are fine, I thought that on our demon-free night, you were going to be chased by one... you know that they don't have any holidays or weekends...Okay I'll just brush my teeth and head to...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where would it be... Riley's pad or your lonely bed?&quot;, Willow said convincing the slayer to go into her boyfriend's arms, she needed some privacy.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll go to Riley's, gotta stretch this day to the fullest, COs tomorrow we are back to strike the enemy. Besides it's not that late... okay I'll grab my lipstick and some stalks, just in case&quot;.</p>
<p>Willow waited for Buffy to leave and called Tara.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tara... I am sorry I didn't call you right away, but I was having a little chat with Buff&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, you're forgiven.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to keep you awake, so take some rest, see ya tomorrow&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Nite Willow&quot;</p>
<p>Willow regretted not talking some more with Tara... she had been so cold. She decided she'd make it up to her. Starting right now. She speed dialed Tara again.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello Tara... it's me again&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hey Willow, did you forget to tell me something?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, I just wanted to hear your voice&quot; (was that tooo chessy?)</p>
<p>&quot;That's nice of you to say, maybe I should record some tapes with my voice for you...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think I already have ones, I stole your answering machine tapes...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So it was you? I was going to report it to the police... such valuable tapes!&quot; Tara joked.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course you know I am teasing you, don't ya...?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I hope your not.. about the voice part&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.. that's true. The thing is Tara, I wanted to tell you I had a great time with you tonight and that I really like spending time with you. I, I, I've never felt so close to someone in such a short time...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Me too... I really love you, I mean, like you...&quot; (Tara couldn't believe she spilled the Love word in this conversation..)</p>
<p>&quot;The thing is Tara, that... I felt something really special tonight while we held hands, it was like being being electrocuted, but in a good way...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If there's a good way on being electrocuted...&quot;, Tara joked..</p>
<p>&quot;Well more like electric pulses in my hand... that's better. And when you asked me if I had ever kissed a girl...God I can't believe I am going to say this. Actually I can't&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Please go on... Willow. Don't stop&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can't just say it...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can you spell it for me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O-K-A-Y...I- W-A-N-T another word, T-O, another word.. K-I-S-S, another word Y-O-U, Tara, are you still there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;ME, another word T-O-O&quot; </p>
<p>THey wished at the same moment that there were some kinda of spell that could tele-transport them to each other, but they went with the more conventional way, walking.</p>
<p>&quot;Can I come over?&quot;, Willow asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Please, hurry!&quot; Tara was anxious..</p>
<p>Willow brushed her teeth violently, gargled a bit... poured some more perfume, and ran out the door. Tara was fixing her room, lighting some candles and choosing some music... creating the perfect atmosphere.</p>
<p>The door was already opened when Willow arrived at Tara's dorm. </p>
<p>&quot;Hey Willow&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, this is great!&quot;, she said closing the door from behind.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought I had to give the first step if I wanted to win you over. But you totally surprised me with your proposal...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tara, I wasn't sure if you liked me... in this way. But tonight when I saw your eyes, my doubts vanished away...This is all very new to me, but it's exciting, it's...&quot;</p>
<p>Tara approached towards Willow and grabbed her hand and placed it in her thumping chest. </p>
<p>&quot;That's some band you've got there!&quot; Willow joked, she was Oh-So very nervous. </p>
<p>&quot;Can I hold you Will?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Please...&quot;</p>
<p>Tara opened her arms and embraced Willow. Willow circled Tara's waist, while Tara was making contact&nbsp; up stairs, between her lips and the red head's neck. Willow was shivering with passion, she had never felt something like that, not even with Oz. And that was just in the neck... Willow caressed Tara's back gently and then moved her hands into her shoulders parting them. </p>
<p>Willow stared at Tara's glossy pink lips... they looked so yummy, like some sort of tropical fruit. Tara pulled their distance apart and connected her lips with Willow's. The touch made them tremble, the small peck grew into the tasting of each other's lips, savoring the moisty kisses, then came some tongue caving each others throat's. None of them wanted to stop,&nbsp; suddenly after 20 minutes of passionate making out they ran out of saliva. </p>
<p>&quot;I think we found another distraction that would keep us away from our spells regimen&quot; said Tara.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't stop, please... I want you&quot;, Willow kissed Tara's neck and a little moan escaped from her mouth. </p>
<p>Tara hugged Willow and took her to bed. Things would be easier in there than standing...</p>
<p>&quot;Are you okay?&quot;, asked Tara trying to find an answer in Willow's eyes. She seemed to be having the time of her life.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay? I am more than okay!&quot;</p>
<p>Willow was kinda of playing kissing Twister, she said a body part and then pressed her lips kissing that part. Except here there was no choice clock in this game. </p>
<p>&quot;Neck!&quot; whispered Willow kissing Tara's neck who had the scars of passion:many hickies. Her eyes were balling out.</p>
<p>&quot;Chin!&quot;, and she completed the same action, Tara cheated this time kissing Willow's lips when she finished doing her chin.</p>
<p>&quot;This is better than chocolate!&quot; said Willow the brief second Tara was taking some breath to continue the kissing session, &quot;That sounded very Sarah McLachlan...!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I think we should stop if we don't wanna wind up in the ER for dehydration or heart attack&quot; Tara suggested, she was very happy but things were going so quick all of the sudden.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay... Just one last kiss&quot;, pleaded Willow. Tara moved close and tasted the red hair's sweet lips one more time, Willow massaged Tara's neck with her hands in a circular motion.</p>
<p>&quot;We should take this slowly, don't you think? We can't burn all the matches today!&quot;, said Tara rubbing Willow's knee.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sure we have plenty of matches, as a matter of fact, a whole factory of matches... and endless supply!&quot; Willow replied.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you wanna stay over the night?&quot;, asked Tara, but more than a question it was plead.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd love that!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cool! Here, so that you can sleep comfortable...&quot;, said Tara handing over an extra-large shirt.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't need a T-shirt to feel comfortable, all I need is you.&quot; </p>
<p>Tara kissed Willow one more time, it was a way of rewarding her sweet words...Willow went to the bathroom to change her clothes.</p>

<hr size=1 color=black width=200>

<p>The girls went into bed. </p>
<p>&quot;Can I hold you?&quot; asked Willow blinking with a little shyness.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, come here baby!&quot;</p>
<p>Tara held Willow real tight, their legs were tangled around each other, their arms where coiled like a DNA structure... They were waiting for the other to close their eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;You are soo beautiful!&quot; Tara couldn't believe Willow had layed eyes on her, because she was just like a red headed goddess without wings.</p>
<p>&quot;No you are prettier... I'd bet that if there were some Witches Pageant, you'd be the winner...!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are so sweet Willow! But I think there would be a tie.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not if I were a judge...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, let's try and sleep because remember we have a meeting tomorrow with our wiccan friends&quot;, Tara kissed Willow's front, then skipped to her nose, then jumped her lips to both her cheeks and finally landed into her lover's anxious lips.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, don't go anywhere,&quot; Willow kissed Tara back. It was like some sort of political debate, each wanted to have the last word, but this time, it was about the last kiss.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not going anywhere without you, I love you! and I mean that fully!&quot; Tara said it and then kissed Willow back.</p>
<p>&quot;I love you too!&quot;, Willow kissed her back, &quot;Good night&quot;.</p>
<p>Both girls closed their eyes but touched each other to make sure this was really happening, and wasn't part of just some chessy alternate universe.</p>
<p>Even though they were fairly tired and needed to sleep, neither of them could... Tara was burning in desire. She was feeling like a pot of boiling water. She wished their clothes would evaporate, so that she could feel Willow's silky skin next to hers. Willow thought that if her head were plugged to a T.V. set, it would look as if it was part of the Playboy channel, she was imagining so many things that made her breathe hard, even now that she was just thinking about them.</p>
<p>Tara seemed to be sleeping comfortable still gripping Willow's waist. Willow couldn't believe the last series of events, she stared at Tara's gentle features, her fresh breathing, her perfect stillness. The red headed wanted to see Tara in the full flesh and rip her worn out T-shirt.&nbsp; Feel her, without any fabric limits avoiding their skin to skin contact. She tried to move slowly taking away the blankets that covered Tara's body. Sure she'd seen naked girls before... she saw one in the mirror every morning (Dah?), in R rated movies, she'd seen her mom (would that count?), she'd seen Buffy and many other girls at the gym's locker room. But she'd never felt curious about any of them. However she was trying now to lift Tara's shirt for a little more skin view. </p>
<p>Willow laughed to herself thinking that she'd also been shy with Tara about showing some skin... after all, she didn't even dare to striptease her clothes off in the same room the blond witch was when putting her pajamas on. Maybe Tara didn't change her clothes in front of Willow because she thought it might make her uncomfortable... who knows. Willow trailed her fingers across Tara's baby skin front, and then whispered to her ear, &quot;Are you dreaming about me?&quot;. A small smile curled up in Tara's lips. Willow kept asking softly &quot;What are you dreaming we are doing?&quot;. Tara kept her eyes closed in some sort of sleeping trance, she moved her hand and cupped Willow's breast. Then drifted her hand down to her stomach and down to her panties. Willow's pulse started raising. Willow knew that she had to reciprocate the action, and wanted very much to do so. Red swayed her fingertips across Tara's thigh, she saw the metamorphosis that her touch made on Tara's skin, her pores opened up with a thirst for passion. </p>
<p>Tara kept fidgeting Willow's downtown, slowly, touching her in a way she'd never experienced. Willow couldn't resist any longer. She felt she was about to explode in a loud moan. She bit her pillow to camouflage her need to scream. Willow wanted to make Tara feel the same she was, but wasn't sure how to. She climbed over Tara's body who still kept her eyes closed expressionless, and took her underwear off. Willow was impressed and excited, like finding a lost treasure. She lifted Tara's shirt higher and saw her nipples go hard, like dough in the oven. She squeezed her nipples and licked them softly. Tara woke up and smiled at Willow. </p>
<p>&quot; Just, where do you think you are going without me?&quot; whispered Tara while Kissing Willow's radiant hair. </p>
<p>&quot;I needed to see you. I had an urge!&quot; Willow said kissing Tara's neck.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, me too but I though you wanted to take things slowly, or so I supposed from your I'm-changing-my-clothes-in-the-bathroom subtext.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh... I just needed to pee. It wasn't about that...you silly!&quot; Willow blushed and kissed Tara hard and heavy.</p>
<p>&quot;So you have some bare necessities...?&quot;</p>
<p>Tara helped Willow get rid of her shirt, and jumped to kiss her breasts immediately.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey! What about me? Let's get even..!&quot; said Willow.</p>
<p>Willow gently pulled off Tara's shirt, and quickly embraced each other in a hug that made them finally feel their skin mingling, reacting, perspiring. Their erect nipples piercing each other&#8217;s skin.</p>
<p>Willow layed down again while Tara made her way up with a trail of kisses from her belly-buttom to the final goal: Will's lips. Tara was happy that she was making Willow moan, climax. </p>
<p>Willow held Tara's hands and kissed them, and took them behind her neck creating a new embrace. Willow licked Tara's earlobes and asked &quot;Please, Tara teach me, I want to do it to you, I want you to come with me&quot;. Tara smiled at Willow and kissed her again. </p>
<p>The red pupil followed her teacher's instructions, laughing with her training methods... &quot;Okay, kiss my neck while rubbing my nipples&quot;. </p>
<p>Willow looked at Tara to see if her actions were creating any reactions in her body...&quot; Am I doing Okay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can't believe this is your first time, you sure you didn't to to any summer camp on this, or got some private lessons from Buffy?&quot;, Tara joked.</p>
<p>&quot;Tara!&quot;, Willow laughed.</p>
<p>She could see that her caress was leaving an impression on Tara's eyes, on her lips, on her nipples, making her go wet, wet, wet... just like the musical group.</p>
<p>Tara held Willow tight and whispered softly &quot;You passed the test! But I want to flunk you so that you keep practicing with me...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I love you Tara, now and forever&quot;, Willow closed her eyes, and ordered her brain to download this moment for eternity.</p>
<p>Holding each other enjoying their nakedness, Willow kissed Tara's cheek and asked,&quot; By the way you didn't answer my question back at the movies?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I asked you, if you had kissed another girl before, and instead you jumped at me with another question, avoiding the issue!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay.. I don't know... If kissing your pictures counts, if kissing with my friend Audrey in pre-school counts, if playing spinning the bottle with some friends counts.. then yeah&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh really? That counts?&quot; asked Willow...&quot;Then I guess I'm pretty experienced...specially with that whole spinning the bottle thing and playing Truth or Dare&quot;</p>
<p>The girls laughed and held each other, they oozed happiness and joy from every smile they gave each other. It was an unforgettable night, of many to come. </p>
