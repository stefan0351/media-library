<!-- Changing Times \ Part 3 -->

<p>The next day, just after Alpha shift</p>
<p>B'Elanna walked into the Messhall with Harry and Tom, laughing at something
Harry just said. B'Elanna scanned the room, looking for a clear table. Her
gaze immediately fell onto Seven, who was sitting alone at a table near one
of the large windows.</p>
<p>&#034;I can't get her to eat anything.&#034; Neelix stepped close to the trio, wiping
his hands on the apron he wore over his clothes. When they said nothing, he
continued. &#034;She just sits there and stares out the window.&#034; He sighed.
&#034;Well, what would you like to eat?&#034; He pulled Harry and Tom to the counter.
B'Elanna walked with them part way before pulling away and walking towards
Seven. &#034;B'Elanna, where are you going?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;I'll be back.&#034; B'Elanna called out as she began to weave through the
crowded tables towards Seven. Seven didn't look up when she approached, so
B'Elanna cleared her throat. &#034;Seven?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;I do not require - Lt. Torres. I apologize. I thought you were Neelix
attempting to 'cheer me up' again.&#034; Seven looked up to B'Elanna.</p>
<p>/She mistook me for Neelix?! ... Whoa!/ B'Elanna stepped closer to Seven,
seeing the tear ravaged face. Other than that, however, Seven was completely
composted. &#034;It's ok.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;What do you require?&#034; Seven's voice was gravelly, her throat sore from
crying. B'Elanna wondered why she didn't notice it before.</p>
<p>&#034;I require nothing, Seven. I wanted to invite you to join us.&#034; B'Elanna
tilted her head to where Harry and Tom had sat down.</p>
<p>&#034;No, Thank you, Lt. Torres.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;You know, Seven, it isn't healthy for you to be alone.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Irrelevant. I have always been alone. I always will be alone.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Seven, it's not irrelevant. And you're not alone.&#034; B'Elanna took a deep
breath, hoping what she was about to do was right. &#034;Seven, I realize that
you're mourning, but hurting yourself won't bring One back to Voyager. Back
to life.&#034;</p>
<p>Seven took a deep breath, her throat momentarily closing. &#034;I am aware of
that, Lt. Torres. I simply want to be alone.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Well, you're not going to be alone, Seven. Come on.&#034; B'Elanna grabbed one
of Seven's hands and pulled her out of the chair.</p>
<p>&#034;Where are we going?&#034; Seven allowed herself to be pulled for the time being.</p>
<p>&#034;My quarters. Neelix, can we have 2 trays? I'm gonna' try to cheer Seven
up.&#034;</p>
<p>Neelix, surprised by the Klingon's actions, started preparing both trays.
&#034;Coming right up, B'Elanna.&#034; He quickly finished and carried both to
B'Elanna on a stack able holder.</p>
<p>&#034;Thanks, Neelix.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;No problem, B'Elanna.&#034; The doors slid closed as he called out &#034;Good luck!&#034;
Whether the sentiment was for B'Elanna or Seven, he didn't really know.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>&#034;Hold this, would you?&#034; B'Elanna shoved the trays into Seven's arms. &#034;I've
really gotta' switch these doors over to automatic open when locked.&#034; She
mumbled to herself.</p>
<p>&#034;Why are you doing this, Lt. Torres?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Call me B'Elanna. I'm doing this because you need a friend, Seven.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;You have never attempted to be my friends before Lt - B'Elanna.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Yeah, I know. Well, guess what. Times change.&#034; B'Elanna finished putting
in her code and the doors slid open. &#034;Come on in.&#034; Obviously not waiting
for Seven to move on her own, B'Elanna pulled Seven across the threshold, the
door sliding shut behind them. The lights automatically brightened and
B'Elanna picked up a convenient cloth, wiping the table quickly. Taking the
trays, B'Elanna set them down on the table and went to the replicator. &#034;Sit
down, Seven. I'm sorry about the mess. I wasn't expecting company.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Then why invite me?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;I already told you.. You need a friend. Want something to drink with
dinner?&#034; B'Elanna keyed in the directory.</p>
<p>&#034;Water will suffice, thank you.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Water it is.&#034; B'Elanna carried two waters to the table. Sitting down on
the couch, opposite of Seven, she pulled a tray closer to her. &#034;I'm...
sorry... if what I said in the Messhall hurt you, Seven.&#034;</p>
<p>Seven looked at B'Elanna, one eyebrow raised. &#034;You have said many things in
the past with the intention of hurting me, B'Elanna. This time was no
different.&#034;</p>
<p>/Great. Just great./ B'Elanna sighed. &#034;I shouldn't have tried to hurt you
then, either, Seven. &#034;</p>
<p>Seven looked at B'Elanna carefully. &#034;Apology accepted.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Good.&#034; B'Elanna smiled, her teeth showing. &#034;Now let's eat. And no
arguments. You need to eat something; it might as well be this.&#034; Seeing
Seven open her mouth to argue, she lifted a hand. &#034;Want me to call the Doc?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;No.&#034; Seeing that she wasn't going to win, Seven sighed and picked up her
fork.</p>
<p>&#034;Good. Bon Appetit, Seven.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Bone Appetit, B'Elanna.&#034;</p>
