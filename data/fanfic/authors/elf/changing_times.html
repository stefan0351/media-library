<p>Lt. B'Elanna Torres Personal Log</p>
<p>(Begin recording)</p>
<p>One died today. I'm almost having trouble believing it. It seems so unreal,
not like all the other deaths I've seen before. I know I said I hated idea
of the Borg, any Borg, onboard Voyager, but One was different. Maybe it's
because he wasn't as arrogant as Seven, as the rest of the Borg. He seemed
more like a child. Who woulda' guessed: B'Elanna Torres has maternal
instincts! Engineering would flip if anyone suggested that I could be
sensitive.</p>
<p>Seven... She's trying to be tough. Oh, she looks like nothing is wrong, but
I know it's all an act. You had to really look to see how proud of One Seven
was. But it was there; she did show it. That's something new; she's never
really shown any emotions at all. That's one of the reasons she gets on my
nerves so much; how can anyone be so calm and collected all the time?!? But
I can tell now that the emotions are there, if you really look.</p>
<p>If you really look. You know, I can finally admit to myself that I did look.
I still do. I always have. I've never known anyone that infuriated me so
much! She always acts so damn perfect. So damn efficient. Not to mention
arrogant, stubborn, obnoxious &#060;sigh&#062; beautiful, graceful, cat-like..</p>
<p>Tom and I broke up today. Yanno, it's funny. I've been dating Tom for
almost a year, now. It seems like so much longer.. It really does. Time
can go by at the speed of light or it can drag on for eternity. We talked a
couple of times about getting married. We even made the necessary plans,
talking to the Captain... But for all our plans, it didn't pan out. I guess
it was just a diversion, something to alleviate boredom. Maybe our entire
relationship was like that.. Filler Space. How much of our entire lives are
made up of Filler space?</p>
<p>It's too late for philosophical thinking. I have an early shift tomorrow;
I'm going to bed.</p>

<p>Seven of Nine Personal Log</p>
<p>(Begin recording)</p>
<p>The Borg attacked today. Out of the entire crew, there was only one
casualty.. One. My.. son.</p>
<p>I have two standpoints inside me conflicting with each other. </p>
<p>From my Borg standpoint, what One did was logical. He sacrificed his own
life to save many, as many others on board have attempted to do in the past.
It was One who alerted the Borg to our presence in this system. He knew of
their plans for him, and what would happen to us and others like us if they
accomplished their objectives. By sacrificing himself, One ensured the
safety of the crew of Voyager. At least for a while.</p>
<p>From my Human standpoint, though.. &#060;muffled sob&#062; I ask myself why he had to
die. Why he wouldn't allow the Doctor to take the necessary measures to save
his life. The Doctor told me that mourning is a natural process. One of the
first stages of the mourning process is anger. I already experienced that
stage. I must remember to apologize to the Doctor tomorrow for yelling at
him.</p>
<p>I do not know how Humans handle this. I want to do one thing, but I must do
another. I feel as though my entire body is filled with pain. I do not like
the sensation. My head is 'pounding.' The Captain informed me that crying
would help alleviate the pressure; would take the edge off the hurt. I will
attempt it. The Captain has ordered Cargo Bay Two off limits unless there is
an emergency.</p>
<p>&#060;voice breaking&#062; Goodbye, One. I will... never forget you.</p>

<p>The next day, just after Alpha shift</p>
<p>B'Elanna walked into the Messhall with Harry and Tom, laughing at something
Harry just said. B'Elanna scanned the room, looking for a clear table. Her
gaze immediately fell onto Seven, who was sitting alone at a table near one
of the large windows.</p>
<p>&#034;I can't get her to eat anything.&#034; Neelix stepped close to the trio, wiping
his hands on the apron he wore over his clothes. When they said nothing, he
continued. &#034;She just sits there and stares out the window.&#034; He sighed.
&#034;Well, what would you like to eat?&#034; He pulled Harry and Tom to the counter.
B'Elanna walked with them part way before pulling away and walking towards
Seven. &#034;B'Elanna, where are you going?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;I'll be back.&#034; B'Elanna called out as she began to weave through the
crowded tables towards Seven. Seven didn't look up when she approached, so
B'Elanna cleared her throat. &#034;Seven?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;I do not require - Lt. Torres. I apologize. I thought you were Neelix
attempting to 'cheer me up' again.&#034; Seven looked up to B'Elanna.</p>
<p>/She mistook me for Neelix?! ... Whoa!/ B'Elanna stepped closer to Seven,
seeing the tear ravaged face. Other than that, however, Seven was completely
composted. &#034;It's ok.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;What do you require?&#034; Seven's voice was gravelly, her throat sore from
crying. B'Elanna wondered why she didn't notice it before.</p>
<p>&#034;I require nothing, Seven. I wanted to invite you to join us.&#034; B'Elanna
tilted her head to where Harry and Tom had sat down.</p>
<p>&#034;No, Thank you, Lt. Torres.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;You know, Seven, it isn't healthy for you to be alone.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Irrelevant. I have always been alone. I always will be alone.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Seven, it's not irrelevant. And you're not alone.&#034; B'Elanna took a deep
breath, hoping what she was about to do was right. &#034;Seven, I realize that
you're mourning, but hurting yourself won't bring One back to Voyager. Back
to life.&#034;</p>
<p>Seven took a deep breath, her throat momentarily closing. &#034;I am aware of
that, Lt. Torres. I simply want to be alone.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Well, you're not going to be alone, Seven. Come on.&#034; B'Elanna grabbed one
of Seven's hands and pulled her out of the chair.</p>
<p>&#034;Where are we going?&#034; Seven allowed herself to be pulled for the time being.</p>
<p>&#034;My quarters. Neelix, can we have 2 trays? I'm gonna' try to cheer Seven
up.&#034;</p>
<p>Neelix, surprised by the Klingon's actions, started preparing both trays.
&#034;Coming right up, B'Elanna.&#034; He quickly finished and carried both to
B'Elanna on a stack able holder.</p>
<p>&#034;Thanks, Neelix.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;No problem, B'Elanna.&#034; The doors slid closed as he called out &#034;Good luck!&#034;
Whether the sentiment was for B'Elanna or Seven, he didn't really know.</p>
<p align=center>***</p>
<p>&#034;Hold this, would you?&#034; B'Elanna shoved the trays into Seven's arms. &#034;I've
really gotta' switch these doors over to automatic open when locked.&#034; She
mumbled to herself.</p>
<p>&#034;Why are you doing this, Lt. Torres?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Call me B'Elanna. I'm doing this because you need a friend, Seven.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;You have never attempted to be my friends before Lt - B'Elanna.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Yeah, I know. Well, guess what. Times change.&#034; B'Elanna finished putting
in her code and the doors slid open. &#034;Come on in.&#034; Obviously not waiting
for Seven to move on her own, B'Elanna pulled Seven across the threshold, the
door sliding shut behind them. The lights automatically brightened and
B'Elanna picked up a convenient cloth, wiping the table quickly. Taking the
trays, B'Elanna set them down on the table and went to the replicator. &#034;Sit
down, Seven. I'm sorry about the mess. I wasn't expecting company.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Then why invite me?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;I already told you.. You need a friend. Want something to drink with
dinner?&#034; B'Elanna keyed in the directory.</p>
<p>&#034;Water will suffice, thank you.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Water it is.&#034; B'Elanna carried two waters to the table. Sitting down on
the couch, opposite of Seven, she pulled a tray closer to her. &#034;I'm...
sorry... if what I said in the Messhall hurt you, Seven.&#034;</p>
<p>Seven looked at B'Elanna, one eyebrow raised. &#034;You have said many things in
the past with the intention of hurting me, B'Elanna. This time was no
different.&#034;</p>
<p>/Great. Just great./ B'Elanna sighed. &#034;I shouldn't have tried to hurt you
then, either, Seven. &#034;</p>
<p>Seven looked at B'Elanna carefully. &#034;Apology accepted.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Good.&#034; B'Elanna smiled, her teeth showing. &#034;Now let's eat. And no
arguments. You need to eat something; it might as well be this.&#034; Seeing
Seven open her mouth to argue, she lifted a hand. &#034;Want me to call the Doc?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;No.&#034; Seeing that she wasn't going to win, Seven sighed and picked up her
fork.</p>
<p>&#034;Good. Bon Appetit, Seven.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Bone Appetit, B'Elanna.&#034;</p>

<p>The next morning</p>
<p>Seven woke up to a multitude of sensations. Her head was still pounding
slightly, the edges of her memory fuzzy. /Have I been crying again?/ Her
body, which was nude, was curiously heavy and boneless. She knew she didn't
want to move, but she did anyhow. Immediately the arm around her waist
lifted and one hand cupped her breast. That movement caused seven to become
aware of the warm weight pressed against her right side. Carefully, Seven
looked around the room without moving, attempting to identify where she was.
A memory flashed to the surface, of being pressed against a way half dressed
while B'Elanna's tongue lazily roams across her breasts. Seven took a deep
breath, her nipples tightening from the memory and from the movement of
B'Elanna, pressing closer against her.</p>
<p>B'Elanna, on the edge of consciousness, moved closer to the woman she was
snuggled against. The woman. B'Elanna immediately sat up, grabbing the
sheet to cover her chest, &#034;I - I...&#034; Horrified, B'Elanna realized that
grabbing the sheet had caused it to slide down Seven's body until it pooled
at her waist; Seven's breasts were clearly visible, her hard rosy pink
nipples proudly displayed. B'Elanna felt a rush of moisture between her legs
as she saw Seven's nipples and smelt the spicy aroma of their sex the night
before. /How could I do this?/ &#034;Seven, I'm sorry.&#034;</p>
<p>Seven looked up at the Klingon. &#034;You are sorry? Why?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Seven, it was inappropriate for this to happen.&#034; B'Elanna took a deep
breath.</p>
<p>&#034;Seven raised one eyebrow. &#034;it did not feel inappropriate.</p>
<p>&#034;It is, Seven. Even if it didn't feel inappropriate.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Because we are both female?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;No, though in some cultures that would be a problem.&#034; B'Elanna sighed and
sat down on the edge of the bed. Reaching to the floor, she picked up and
put on her robe. Letting go of the sheet, B'Elanna looked at Seven. &#034;Pull
the sheet up and then we'll talk.&#034; B'Elanna took another deep breath as
Seven pulled the sheet up. Eyeing the newly covered area, B'Elanna couldn't
decide if it was an improvement or not. &#034;Seven, I feel like I took advantage
of you. You don't have any experience with.. in these matters.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;You took advantage of me?&#034; Seven's eyebrows drew together as she considered
the night before.</p>
<p>B'Elanna, still not happy about it, slouched as she nodded. &#034;Yes.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;But I initiated our copulation.&#034;</p>
<p>This threw B'Elanna. She had assumed that *she* initiated the events of the
night before. Granted, she remembered Seven initiating them, but she had
dreamed about it so often she hadn't dare thought it real. &#034;What? Why?&#034;</p>
<p>Seven chose to answer only the latter question, as she had just answered the
first, &#034;I...&#034; Seven paused, trying to collect her thoughts. &#034;I wanted to
be close to you.&#034;</p>
<p>B'Elanna felt her chest constrict. &#034;Oh, Seven.. All you had to do was ask.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;I did ask. That is how we ended up in your bed.&#034; Seven smiled slightly as
B'Elanna laughed.</p>
<p>&#034;Yes, you did.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;What we did is no longer inappropriate?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;No, Seven. Making love was never inappropriate. It was taking advantage of
you that was inappropriate.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;I understand.&#034; Seven looked at B'Elanna. &#034;Since it is not inappropriate,
will you come back to bed?&#034; Seven looked and sounded hopeful.</p>
<p>B'Elanna smiled and immediately slid out of her robe. &#034;I'd love to.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;We do not have time to make love again.&#034; Seven's voice was laced with
disappointment.</p>
<p>&#034;It's ok, Seven. We can just hold each other and talk. We can even catch
another short nap.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Satisfactory.&#034; Seven moved form the middle of the bed, making room for
B'Elanna. She made too much room, though, since B'Elanna proceeded to lay
down with half her body draped over Seven's. Seven ran her left hand gently
up and down B'Elanna's back, the cool metal combining with the heat of
Seven's skin.</p>
<p>&#034;Mmm, that feels good, Seven.&#034; B'Elanna pressed closer to Seven, her leg
lifting and curling around Seven's lower body. B'Elanna's other leg lay
still, tangled in Seven's.</p>
<p>&#034;Does it always end like this, B'Elanna?&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Like what?&#034; B'Elanna was getting drowsy, her words slowing down.</p>
<p>&#034;Does tragedy always end in happiness? If One hadn't lived and died, we
would not be together now.&#034;</p>
<p>&#034;Only if we're lucky, Seven. Only if we're lucky...&#034; With that, B'Elanna
drifted off to sleep, content in the arms of the woman she loved.</p>
