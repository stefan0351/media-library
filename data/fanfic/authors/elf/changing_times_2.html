<p>Seven of Nine Personal Log</p>
<p>(Begin recording)</p>
<p>The Borg attacked today. Out of the entire crew, there was only one
casualty.. One. My.. son.</p>
<p>I have two standpoints inside me conflicting with each other. </p>
<p>From my Borg standpoint, what One did was logical. He sacrificed his own
life to save many, as many others on board have attempted to do in the past.
It was One who alerted the Borg to our presence in this system. He knew of
their plans for him, and what would happen to us and others like us if they
accomplished their objectives. By sacrificing himself, One ensured the
safety of the crew of Voyager. At least for a while.</p>
<p>From my Human standpoint, though.. &#060;muffled sob&#062; I ask myself why he had to
die. Why he wouldn't allow the Doctor to take the necessary measures to save
his life. The Doctor told me that mourning is a natural process. One of the
first stages of the mourning process is anger. I already experienced that
stage. I must remember to apologize to the Doctor tomorrow for yelling at
him.</p>
<p>I do not know how Humans handle this. I want to do one thing, but I must do
another. I feel as though my entire body is filled with pain. I do not like
the sensation. My head is 'pounding.' The Captain informed me that crying
would help alleviate the pressure; would take the edge off the hurt. I will
attempt it. The Captain has ordered Cargo Bay Two off limits unless there is
an emergency.</p>
<p>&#060;voice breaking&#062; Goodbye, One. I will... never forget you.</p>
