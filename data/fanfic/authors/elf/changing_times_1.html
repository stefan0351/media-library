<p>Lt. B'Elanna Torres Personal Log</p>
<p>(Begin recording)</p>
<p>One died today. I'm almost having trouble believing it. It seems so unreal,
not like all the other deaths I've seen before. I know I said I hated idea
of the Borg, any Borg, onboard Voyager, but One was different. Maybe it's
because he wasn't as arrogant as Seven, as the rest of the Borg. He seemed
more like a child. Who woulda' guessed: B'Elanna Torres has maternal
instincts! Engineering would flip if anyone suggested that I could be
sensitive.</p>
<p>Seven... She's trying to be tough. Oh, she looks like nothing is wrong, but
I know it's all an act. You had to really look to see how proud of One Seven
was. But it was there; she did show it. That's something new; she's never
really shown any emotions at all. That's one of the reasons she gets on my
nerves so much; how can anyone be so calm and collected all the time?!? But
I can tell now that the emotions are there, if you really look.</p>
<p>If you really look. You know, I can finally admit to myself that I did look.
I still do. I always have. I've never known anyone that infuriated me so
much! She always acts so damn perfect. So damn efficient. Not to mention
arrogant, stubborn, obnoxious &#060;sigh&#062; beautiful, graceful, cat-like..</p>
<p>Tom and I broke up today. Yanno, it's funny. I've been dating Tom for
almost a year, now. It seems like so much longer.. It really does. Time
can go by at the speed of light or it can drag on for eternity. We talked a
couple of times about getting married. We even made the necessary plans,
talking to the Captain... But for all our plans, it didn't pan out. I guess
it was just a diversion, something to alleviate boredom. Maybe our entire
relationship was like that.. Filler Space. How much of our entire lives are
made up of Filler space?</p>
<p>It's too late for philosophical thinking. I have an early shift tomorrow;
I'm going to bed.</p>
