<!-- Human Error \ Chapter 1 -->

<p>"I'll prepare the surgical bay." Seven watched the Doctor leave, caught between her sense of duty and the joy she found in her holodeck program. Finally, her human side won and she did not stop him. She just breathed a sigh of relief that he had found her in her Chakotay simulation. Had he found her in her favorite program, he might have been given pause.</p>
		<p>She had created exactly six scenarios. In one, there was Chakotay. In the others they dealt with Harry, the Doctor himself, Janeway, Neelix and B'Elanna. Neelix, the Doctor, Janeway and Harry had all been explored as thoroughly as she wished and she had dismissed each one in turn. Of the two she had still been running, she preferred that the Doctor find her running the Chakotay simulation, as she was still ashamed to be considering a woman as happily married as Lieutenant Torres.</p>
		<p>She flashed back on the moment that her cortical node had malfunctioned...</p>
		<p>"Seven, these last few days have been more than 'memorable.' They've been an important step forward, for both of us. Don't throw that away!"</p>
		<p>"I am sorry, Commander." Seven could barely concentrate on the conversation at hand as she imagined the next that would be played out. She hated that she would have to end these sessions, but she just couldn't concentrate.</p>
		<p>"Seven, you're making a mistake." Seven felt her emotions burning, just under the surface. She couldn't imagine how she would endure B'Elanna's version of this reaction, even if it was all a holographic fantasy.</p>
		<p>"No, I am trying to correct one." The hologram walked away and Seven allowed herself a moment to brace for ending the program and beginning the more difficult 'breakup.' She noticed that each one was different. Neelix had agreed that things weren't working out, Harry had offered to remain friends. Kathryn had been angry and the Doctor had begged her to reconsider.</p>
		<p>"Ask yourself why you want to end this? Is it out of a sense of duty, or something else?" 'It is partly that I am not attracted to you romantically,' she thought. 'I tried, but it just didn't work.' "Every time you move closer to your emotions, you back away! Like hiding behind that metronome..." Seven felt her heart race, those emotions he spoke of rearing their ugly head, tearing her apart inside. 'Why must I sacrifice my pleasure for duty?'</p>
		<p>"Your analogy is flawed!"</p>
		<p>"Is it?" Seven asked herself the same question. "I think that you're afraid that embracing your humanity will make you weak, less than perfect." She agreed with him there. "But think about what you stand to gain!"</p>
		<p>"It's irrelevant!"</p>
		<p>"No it's not! Real intimacy, with another person? Nothing's more relevant!" It was then that Seven heard the sound again. Like the first time she had kissed the Chakotay hologram, the first time she had had a date with the Torres hologram. She didn't know what it was, but for a split-second, it was as if all her senses shut down.</p>
		<p>"I must return to my station."</p>
		<p>"Stay here with me."</p>
		<p>"The ship needs me."</p>
		<p>"So do I!"</p>
		<p>"I can't function this way." Seven was becoming very frightened. If she was reacting this strongly to the hologram of the person that she was no longer interested in as more than a friend, then how would she react to the one she was falling in love with?</p>
		<p>"You're not a drone anymore; you're human!"</p>
		<p>"Stop!" Seven staggered away, the sound beginning again, like static.</p>
		<p>"Seven, What's wrong?" Seven couldn't hear past the sound, her head was starting to pound and she was beginning to lose feeling in parts all over her body. She picked up her commbadge and pressed it, knowing that she needed to get to Sickbay.</p>
		<p>"Sickbay. Medical emergency." The last thing she heard was the doctor's worried response, then everything went dark.</p>
		<p>Yes, she would have the surgery. Duty be damned, the hologram had been right. She was hiding from her humanity, despite her desperate need to embrace it. To have a convenient excuse such as "if I feel, it will kill me" was more weak than allowing herself to be human, to be flawed. Though she would have liked to just allow the malfunction so that she did not have to explore her feelings for Lt. Torres, she knew that that was cowardice.</p>
		<p>Just as it was cowardice that prevented her from attending B'Elanna's baby shower. The idea of seeing her together with Lt. Paris was painful for Seven. So she had hid in the holodeck, played out her version of the scenario the day before, where she could insult Tom and joke with B'Elanna comfortably. But on the day that she actually had the chance to do so, she found herself preferring the 'perfect world' of the holodeck.</p>
		<p>And so she set off for Sickbay, hoping that when she was 'repaired,' perhaps she would no longer be troubled by her difficulties separating personal life from professional, nor any trouble socializing. Perhaps she would be as witty as she managed in private, even smile for the crew rather than just herself.</p>
		<p>Maybe she could be human...</p>
