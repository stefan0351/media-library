<!-- Human Error \ Chapter 4 -->

<p>Seven sat in the Mess Hall, waiting for B'Elanna to return. Already, she had been given the grim news. A battle... A huge battle had occurred with major casualties. Not the least of which being Commander Chakotay.</p>
		<p>Chakotay...</p>
		<p>Icheb...</p>
		<p>Seven buried her face in her hands so that no one around her would see her crying. B'Elanna said that Chakotay had given his life saving Captain Janeway's. Icheb had died after an accident in Astrometrics. Janeway had promoted him to field Ensign just a few moments before he died, satisfying his dreams. Letting him die knowing that he had accomplished his goal.</p>
		<p>Harry Kim had been promoted to Lieutenant, Tuvok to Commander. Samantha Wildman had died and Neelix... had barely come out of it alive. He had to have half of his limbs replaced and he still hadn't regrown all of his whiskers.</p>
		<p>"Seven?" Seven turned towards Naomi's voice and heard her gasp. She assumed then, that it was obvious that she was blind. "What happened to your eye?"</p>
		<p>"I do not know."</p>
		<p>"Can you see?"</p>
		<p>"No. I am sorry about your mother." There was silence. Seven started shaking, wondering if Naomi blamed her.</p>
		<p>It had, after all, been the Borg who had killed Samantha Wildman. Attempting to retrieve Seven after her implants resurfaced and sent out a homing beacon.</p>
		<p>"It's not your fault, Seven. My mom knew that being in Starfleet was dangerous. So did I. I just..." Seven detected the faint intake of breath and realized that Naomi was crying. Seven felt around for the child's hand and was surprised to find that it was larger than the last time she had felt it. Naomi turned her hand over and clutched Seven's.</p>
		<p>"I am certain that your mother would be proud of how brave you are," Seven said, reassuring Naomi. She felt a slight movement in the hand and wondered if Naomi was nodding.</p>
		<p>"She was worried about you. We all were. Can you feel now?"</p>
		<p>"Yes, I believe that I can." Seven responded.</p>
		<p>"Good. Then it wasn't in vain." Seven was again startled, only this time, it was the adult tone of Naomi's voice. 'She's growing up.' Seven noted. 'Perhaps more quickly due to the loss of her mother. A loss I caused.'</p>
		<p>Two months later....</p>
		<p>Seven opened her eyes. The light was blinding, and so beautiful for it. She hadn't seen anything since the day she awoke, what seemed an eternity ago. So many things had happened, but she was overwhelmed.</p>
		<p>Tom had dumped B'Elanna, she had discovered, because she had spent days and nights working with the Doctor on a way to help Seven, never stopping until she collapsed. She had gone into premature labor from the exertion and almost lost Mira. Tom had declared that she wasn't fit for motherhood and challenged her for custody of Mira.</p>
		<p>Neither had won.</p>
		<p>Janeway had decided that both parties would share custody, trading off once she was older and not dependant on B'Elanna for nourishment. Tom left B'Elanna, saying she never cared about him or Mira, leaving her an emotional wreck. The effects were physical. She lost weight, lost the ability to lactate and ended up in Sickbay more than once from exhaustion.</p>
		<p>Tom noticed. He tried to apologize, but B'Elanna wouldn't speak to him. She sat by Seven's side, holding Mira all day long. So she wasn't alone.</p>
		<p>Seven had cried herself to sleep every night since B'Elanna had 'caught her up' on the events of Voyager. And she did sleep. The doctor devised a system where she regenerated only every other night, sleeping the rest of the time. Quarters had been arranged for this purpose, but her alcove remained in Cargo Bay Two, the only place on Voyager designed for it.</p>
		<p>Now she could see. Not just in her dreams anymore, Seven saw what was around her in beautiful detail. The doctor was smiling at her and she sat up and hugged him. This was the last of the 'treatments'; the last of the surgeries. She was free of the inhibitor. Forever.</p>
		<p>She was as Human as she could be.</p>
		<p>And all it had cost, was the lives of twenty-three crewmembers. Seven smiled at the doctor, already becoming adept at hiding the hard-won emotions. She managed to thank him and leave Sickbay. She managed to travel all the way to her quarters before she broke down and cried.</p>
		<p>"Seven?" B'Elanna asked, revealing herself for the first time. Seven tried to compose herself, but she was too far gone. She only managed to sound pathetic. B'Elanna was holding her in an instant, asking what was wrong, trying to offer comfort.</p>
		<p>Seven sobbed out her mind, letting B'Elanna know how depressed she had become. B'Elanna rocked Seven, cursing the Borg in every language she could think of and wishing she knew more. Seven didn't know how important she had become to B'Elanna. How every time that she had come out of her comas, they had grown closer.</p>
		<p>She had tried more than once to broach this subject with Seven, but when Seven had awakened without any memories of the time spent together, with the confidences exchanged, she suddenly felt shy. It was uncomfortable having memories of someone when that other person didn't share them. Just like feelings, attractions. The one-sidedness was emotionally draining.</p>
		<p>But Seven was already drained enough, emotionally. Twenty-one years of pent up emotions, denied to her, had almost killed her. B'Elanna didn't know if Seven even remembered being in love with her.</p>
		<p>She knew that Seven didn't recall that she loved her back.</p>
		<p>So she didn't press the issue, didn't push Seven. And she hated that she had missed this part of her friend. That Seven hadn't told her how much she hurt from the accusations that no one but the ex-drone herself put on her shoulders.</p>
		<p>Because no one on Voyager blamed Seven. Everyone hated the Borg. Seven missed that in her self-loathing. She didn't realize that Voyager's crew didn't see her as a Borg anymore. That they all wanted revenge for her and those that they had lost to the mechanical race.</p>
		<p>B'Elanna tried to tell her, But Seven just cried and couldn't believe that no one blamed her.</p>
		<p>"You're right Seven. There is someone who blames you for what the Borg did." B'Elanna finally snapped. Seven looked up and wiped her face, curious.</p>
		<p>"Who?" B'Elanna took Seven's face in her hands and met her troubled blue eyes.</p>
		<p>"You." Seven tried to move away, but B'Elanna held tight. "You are the only one on Voyager that hates you. Everyone else sees you as a victim of the Borg, which is what you are!" Seven started to get angry, then her face crumpled and she cried. It was more than B'Elanna could take and she brushed her lips against Seven's. Seven jerked away, startled. B'Elanna forced herself not to react, forced herself to be strong. </p>
		<p>"B'Elanna?" Seven asked, looking terrified.</p>
		<p>"No one hates you, Seven. In fact, some of us love you." With that, B'Elanna crawled to Seven, who backed away. B'Elanna followed her until Seven was pressed against the wall. B'Elanna slid her hand around Seven's slender neck and pulled her closer, bringing their lips together again.</p>
		<p>"Is this real?" Seven asked, tears still making tracks down her face.</p>
		<p>"Nothing is more real to me," B'Elanna told her and kissed her again.</p>
