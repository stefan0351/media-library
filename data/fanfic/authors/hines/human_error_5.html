<p>Two months later...</p>
		<p>"I'm not sure I want to go," B'Elanna said as she watched Seven dressing for Neelix's open mike night at Sandrine's. The old program was being run with the intention of letting the Voyager crew share their various talents. B'Elanna felt that she had no talents on a stage, so she hadn't signed up. Seven hadn't told her that she had.</p>
		<p>"That is unfortunate. I had hoped that you would accompany me," Seven said, trying to coax B'Elanna into coming with her, without telling her that she would be performing a song she had written herself.</p>
		<p>"We could stay in, tonight. Just the two of us..." B'Elanna said sexily, making Seven smile. B'Elanna rolled on the bed, trying to make herself seem enticing, but noticed the quiet determination in Seven's eye and began pouting. "Don't you want to spend time with me?"</p>
		<p>"Of course I do. That is why I asked you to be my date for this social event."</p>
		<p>"I've heard Harry play his clarinet and the only other people I know that are signed up have already rehearsed their act for me. So why should I go? Why should you?"</p>
		<p>"Naomi Wildman intends to read a poem that she wrote. I promised her that I would attend. The crew needs morale right now, Lanna. Yourself included. I know for a fact that at least two comedic acts are scheduled. Certainly you could use a laugh?" B'Elanna sighed.</p>
		<p>"Alright, you twisted my arm. I'll go." B'Elanna sat up and swung her legs off the bed. "Just for Naomi, though. I know how much she means to you." Seven finished adjusting her hair and turned to look at B'Elanna. B'Elanna was already naked and Seven stopped for a moment to admire the view.</p>
		<p>B'Elanna finally ended up in a red dress, a contrast to the silvery blue one that Seven wore. When she turned, Seven was openly gaping at her. She smiled and wiggled her hips. Seven walked to B'Elanna and placed her hands on the shorter woman's hips. Seven smiled down at B'Elanna and kissed her gently.</p>
		<p>"Shall we?"</p>
		<p>"Can't sleep at night
			<br>without a light.
			<br>Torn by machines
			<br>you can't hear my screams.
			<br>But I'm all right
			<br>in bed at night
			<br>because I'm not alone
			<br>I have a home
			<br>It's here on this ship.
			<br>So when this trip
			<br>is over I hope
			<br>that I can cope.
			<br>Don't know if I'll be okay
			<br>But at least I'll have today."
		</p>
		<p>Seven saw Captain Janeway wipe her eyes as she brushed away the trickle on her own cheek.</p>
		<p>"Thank you, Naomi, that was wonderful," Neelix said as the applause died down and Naomi ducked off the stage, blushing. "And our next act is... Seven of Nine, who will be singing a song of her own composition." B'Elanna's head swung toward Seven, who was rising from her seat. All eyes followed her up to the stage, where she instructed the computer to begin playing the background music that she had recorded previously. </p>
		<p>A band appeared and within a few seconds, they began playing. Seven stepped up to the microphone and B'Elanna felt tears well up as the first soft, clear note came from Seven's full lips.</p>
		<p>"You look at her there
			<br>sitting with her hair
			<br>blowing in the breeze
			<br>it's times like these
			<br>frozen in your mind
			<br>you know to say "she's mine"
		</p>
		<p>"But like the wind
			<br> you can't comprehend
			<br> why she makes you feel so good
			<br> it's just understood
		</p>
		<p>"That love will do this</p>
		<p>"So prick another thorn
			<br> on this beauty torn
			<br> and feel another day
			<br> inside her drift away
			<br> and wish that you were there
			<br> you knew she always cared..."
		</p>
		<p>Seven glared at Tom as she sung and he squirmed in his seat. It was no secret that he had been trying to reclaim B'Elanna, to no avail.</p>
		<p>"But you didn't really see
			<br> what was meant to be
			<br> no matter how you tried
			<br> it slipped away and died
		</p>
		<p>"And so now she's mine
			<br> and I swear this time
			<br> you won't touch a wave
			<br> when she says "I crave"
			<br> 'cause you made her cry
			<br> when you said good-bye
		</p>
		<p>"Love will do this</p>
		<p>"So blind it tortures
			<br> now that she's not yours
			<br> 'cause you threw it away
		</p>
		<p>"I'll never understand you</p>
		<p>"Love will do this." Seven opened her eyes to the stunned audience. For a second, they were frozen in silence, then Tom clapped slowly. The rest of the audience followed suit. Seven smiled slightly and whispered into the microphone, "Thank you."</p>
