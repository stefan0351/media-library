<!-- Telling Series \ Section 7: Dad - A Little Fall Of Rain -->

<p>Mike watched as Sam entered the kitchen, nodded a hello and went about making
herself a snack. He was unsure how to act around her, he had no idea what to
say. There was no denying anymore that what she and Brooke had was real and not
a passing fling, a plot, experimentation or phase, no matter how much he might
wish otherwise. It was genuine, sincere, deep and passionate and came from
somewhere deep within their souls. And it scared him. </p>
<p>He had seen the changes in his daughter without Sam when Sam left to give him
space to deal with the situation. A gesture he still thought of as mature and
left him with a new respect for the brunette reporter, despite his initial
over-the-top reaction to the whole situation. In spite of all he had said and
done, including raising his hand to her, Sam was still willing to give him what
he needed to adjust to the news. She had acted like a responsible mature adult
and he had acted like a first class ass. </p>
<p>But he had seen how Brooke had retreated into herself without Sam as her
anchor. She had begun to starve herself again as a way to regain control over
her life, control he had ripped away from her. Brooke had struggled her entire
life with her self-image, why Mike didn't know since she was everyone's ideal of
perfection, but Brooke was never happy or comfortable in her own skin. Unknown
to Mike, Sam made Brooke comfortable and happy with herself inside and out and
he threatened to take that safety away from her. </p>
<p>So she got thinner and sicker and he was powerless to help or stop her. And
finally he understood how she felt. While he was initially upset with Jane for
calling Sam and then letting the two teenage girls take off on a road trip, he
knew that Brooke's only hope for salvation this time lay with Sam. </p>
<p>He saw the girl who bounded in the door, hand in hand with Sam a week
earlier, refreshed, rejuvenated and reborn after her little vacation. He knew
Brooke's renewed health and strength was due to Sam. He had been so afraid that
he was really going to lose her to the anorexia this time. That this time there
would be no rescue for her. She would waste away to nothing, growing sicker,
thinner with each passing day until she slipped through his fingers and her poor
broken heart ceased to beat completely. He was aware that a lot of the blame
should that have happened would have rested squarely on his shoulders. </p>
<p>But the girl who came through that door was not the broken shadow of a girl
who had been haunting the house in weeks past. No, this girl absolutely glowed
with positive energy. The spark was back along with her natural grace, color and
personality, plus, much to everyone's immense relief, Sam had managed to put a
few pounds back onto Brooke's tall and lanky frame. Apparently Sam had picked up
some cooking skills while visiting San Francisco. </p>
<p>He watched as Sam finished making her pb&amp;j (nothing beats the basics) and
decided that if nothing else, he at least owed her a thank you for saving
Brooke's life-again. </p>
<p>"Sam?" he said softly, causing her to jump in mild surprise. He'd barely
spoken to her since she and Brooke returned home. While he was no longer rude or
malicious, he wasn't exactly open either. </p>
<p>"Yeah?" she responded warily looking from Mike to the door as if judging
whether or not she could beat him to it. It made him sad to know that he now
evoked such a reaction from a girl he really did think of as another daughter.
</p>
<p>"Could you.would you mind sitting down with me for a while? I'd like to talk
to you," he fumbled but finally managed to ask. Sam looked at him strangely for
a minute but then shrugged. </p>
<p>"If you're about to go at me with both barrels, Mike, I gotta tell you, I'm
too tired to deal with it," she said sadly. Mike took a good look at her and saw
that she indeed looked more tired than usual lately. She looked beaten, defeated
even. Now he was confused. She had Brooke, her mother's blessing, even Harrison
and Carmen were coming around, he wasn't demanding her head on a platter and yet
she still looked like she'd lost her best friend. </p>
<p>"What's wrong, Sam? Why are you tired?" he asked genuinely concerned. She
gave him an annoyed look but saw that he was serious in his concern and then
sighed as she sat down. </p>
<p>"Look, between my nightmares and Brooke's, coming home to either find her or
my Mom in tears over this whole thing, dealing with school, you and my own crap,
I haven't had time to catch my breath, OK?" she snapped, frustrated. Mike nodded
in understanding. He hadn't made it easy for her that was for sure. And she was
trying so hard to take care of Brooke and Jane it was easy to see why she'd be
getting run down. Unknown to both of them, Brooke had come downstairs to get a
bottle of water and was standing outside the room out of sight listening. </p>
<p>"You take care of them but who takes care of Sam?" Sam stared at him in angry
shock. Her eyes narrowed. </p>
<p>"I take care of myself, Mike. Brooke and Mom do what they can but when it
comes down to it, Sam McPherson takes care of Sam McPherson." </p>
<p>"Lonely way to be," Mike pointed out. </p>
<p>"Worked great after Dad died," Sam shot back. </p>
<p>"You took great care of Brooke," Mike added gently. Sam's eyes softened. </p>
<p>"I love her, Mike. I know that bothers you but I'm done apologizing for
something I have nothing to feel sorry for. I wasn't going to stand by and watch
her disappear. Besides, she took care of me when I needed it after the
accident." </p>
<p>"Because she loves you," Mike said, not as a question but as a fact. Sam
stared at him speechless. "I still don't like it, Sam,it's not right." He saw
the spark of anger flash across Sam's brown eyes and held up his hand to ward
off the oncoming outburst. "Please, hear me out." </p>
<p>"But I love my daughter. And believe it or not, I care for you too. I may not
like it or think that it's right but I have realized a few things. 1) This isn't
going away or going to change no matter how much I rant or rave or wish
otherwise. What I see between you and Brooke is what I hope people see between
Jane and I. Pure, unadulterated love. 2) My daughter is gay and you didn't make
her that way. This is no twisted plot on your part to tear this family apart. I
accused you of destroying this family when I was the guilty party, Sam. I see
that now. 3) If I don't learn to accept or at least overlook this, I will lose
Brooke, Jane and Mac. And you, Sam. Everything. Because of petty ignorance and
prejudice. I'll be alone with no one to blame but myself." Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Harsh realizations, aren't they?" she asked seriously. </p>
<p>"You gave me the space and chance to make them, Sam. Thank you. And you saved
my baby girl from destroying herself. I owe you for that. Again thank you." </p>
<p>"I love her, Mike, more than you can imagine. It killed me to leave her like
that," a few tears fell down Sam cheeks as she spoke and were unknowingly
mirrored on Brooke's who sat on the floor outside the kitchen door, still
listening. </p>
<p>"Why did you, if it hurt so much?" </p>
<p>"I couldn't let her lose you because of me. Do you know what it's like to
know that the two people you love most in the world are losing everything
because they love you back?" Mike shook his head guiltily. "Yeah, well it sucks
big time." </p>
<p>"How long have you loved Brooke?" Mike asked, wanting and needing to
understand Sam's feelings for Brooke. Sam looked at him for a minute but seemed
to understand where the question was coming from. And she was glad that he was
willing to ask, it meant that he was beginning to travel the road to accepting
it. </p>
<p>"A long time. Before the accident, I know that much. I don't know when my
feelings went from hostile to passionate exactly. I just know that I can't see
my life without her anymore," she said honestly. </p>
<p>"Is that why you pushed her out of the way of the car?" Sam shook her head
with a smile. </p>
<p>"I love that question," she said dryly. "Yes and no. Yes because I would
never be able to see harm come to Brooke if it were in my power to prevent it.
If it meant giving my life to save hers, OK fine. I'd die happy in the knowledge
that Brooke would wake up to face another day. And no, because no one deserves
to get hit with an expensive luxury vehicle, or any car for that matter. Hell, I
probably would have done the same thing for anyone, even Nicole." </p>
<p>"Even knowing the pain you'd go through?" Mike asked, slightly confused. </p>
<p>"Eh, pain is temporary, love is forever," Sam said with a wide smile,
repeating her father's message. She looked at Mike seriously and the smile
faded. </p>
<p>"Do you understand what your daughter means to me?" Mike sighed. </p>
<p>"I think I'm beginning to." Sam thought a minute and seemed to come to a
decision before speaking again. </p>
<p>"I'm going to tell you something, something I haven't even admitted to Brooke
but it stays between the two of us, understand?" she asked rigorously. Mike
nodded and outside the door, Brooke shifted so that she could hear better. </p>
<p>"I never told her this because I don't want her to get upset. She still gets
upset talking about the accident but maybe it'll help you understand. Maybe I
just need to tell someone this, I don't know. Maybe if I get it off my chest I
can finally get a good nights sleep, who knows? But Brooke once asked me what I
remembered about that night and I told her just bits and pieces. That was a lie,
Mike. You know how they say that a bad trauma will cause the brain to forget the
worst of it?" Mike nodded. "Yeah, well, I musta taken a particuarly hard bump to
that section of my grey matter because I remember everything. Crystal." </p>
<p>"I can tell you how cold that asphalt was on my back, Mike. I already
couldn't feel much below my waist. But there were three rocks digging into my
back as I lay there bleeding in Brooke's arms. My head hurt like a son of a
bitch and I felt like I was drowning, I couldn't breathe. I was cold, scared,
hurt and I was sure I was about to die. And then she was there, Mike. My own
beautiful golden angel, Brooke, holding me and keeping me safe. Once I knew she
was OK I could let go. I never thought she'd feel the same for me as I did for
her but the fact that she was right there for me as I lay dying made me feel
less afraid. And my pain faded when she smiled at me." She was crying as she
spoke, her voice cracking in places and Mike was a wreck as Sam relived that
awful night in front of him. She was letting down her walls for him to see and
he was honored to witness her this vulnerable. </p>
<p>"I was content to die right there, Mike, because I had done what I set out to
do and she was alive, breathing and safe. I thought I saw my Dad on that street,
calling out for me to join him. I heard him and then I heard Brooke speaking to
me in that beautiful voice of hers and as much as I missed my Dad, I had to
listen to Brooke. She sounded so sad. I had to hold on if only for her. I opened
my eyes and saw her and everything else faded away and my entire world consisted
of only her." </p>
<p>"Jesus, Sammy," Brooke sobbed quietly outside the room although no one heard
her. </p>
<p>"When they put me in that ambulance, I tried so hard to hold on to her
because I knew I was losing the fight. I knew I was either going to die or at
least slip into unconsciousness and I wanted the last thing I saw, my last
thought not to be of my pain or the accident, but to be of Brooke. And do you
know what the last thing I saw was?" Mike shook his head as he wiped away some
of his tears. Sam smiled. </p>
<p>"I saw her smile at me. That warm `everything will be all right' smile that
just lights up her face and warms you from within. And I believed her, Mike. And
I came home from my coma to that, never expecting things to work out the way
they did. Never dreaming that they would, but they did. And you know what? I
wouldn't trade any of it. Not a rock, a stitch, a twinge when the weather turns,
a scar, a nightmare, or any of it. No regrets, nothing. It was all worth it."
</p>
<p>It was several minutes before Mike could form a response to Sam's confession.
He sat there crying for a while and Sam just waited knowing that at last he was
coming to terms with the truth whether he liked it or not. </p>
<p>"And you never told her this?" he finally managed to ask, his voice raspy
from tears. He remembered that night all too well when the doctor outlined Sam's
injuries. Knowing that the girl remembered and lived with every ache and pain
and had never said a word was emotionally traumatizing to him and also made him
look at her in a new light. There was a strength to Sam that Mike would never
understand or could ever hope to emulate. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"I don't want to hurt her. She feels enough pain over the whole thing for
both of us as it is. Do you think we'll ever both get over it, Mike?" Sam asked,
sounding very much like a lost child. Mike shrugged. </p>
<p>"I can't say, Sam. I'd like to hope so. Scars fade and eventually so do
memories." Sam nodded, satisfied with the answer. </p>
<p>"So, are we better?" she asked, using her hand to indicate herself and him.
Mike gave her a small smile. </p>
<p>"I can't wave a magic wand and suddenly be OK with this whole thing, Sam, I
don't work that way. But you and Brooke were right in the first place, we should
have sat down and talked this out. I was wrong to have acted the way I did.
Maybe with time I can learn to accept it." </p>
<p>"Time is something we have lots of," Sam told him happily. </p>
<p>"And I never would have hit you," Mike looked away ashamed. Sam reached out
and put her hand over his. </p>
<p>"I know, heat of the moment. I shouldn't have slapped you either. Draw?" </p>
<p>"Draw," Mike agreed, glad to be let off the hook by Sam but still feeling
guilty. "Have I ever told you what an amazing individual you are?" Sam gave him
a lopsided smile. </p>
<p>"Not for a very long time," she said honestly. </p>
<p>"Well you are. Most people would have hated me for my reaction to you and
Brooke, the way I acted, the fact that I tried to hit you." </p>
<p>"Mike, if I can forgive Nic for running me over, I can forgive anyone." </p>
<p>"Still, Sam, thank you." </p>
<p>"It's a start." </p>
