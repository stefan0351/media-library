<!-- Opposing Sides \ Chapter 3 -->

<p>Sam lay in her bed staring at the ceiling later that night
when Brooke suddenly appeared in her bathroom doorway. </p>
<p>"Sammy," Brooke called softly. Sam lifted her head and stared
at Brooke, clad only in a thin, almost see-through white teddy. Sam swallowed
and tried to control her breathing. </p>
<p>"Brooke?" she questioned wishing her voice hadn't suddenly
come out three octaves too high. Brooke stalked over to the bed and stood at the
foot of it looking down at Sam with a predatory gleam in her eyes. </p>
<p>"Sam," she whispered her voice low and husky. Sam's pulse
quickened again at the tone of Brooke's voice. </p>
<p>"Brooke, what are you doing?" she asked. Brooke leaned down on
the end of the bed and crawled up the length of Sam's body. Sam felt her body
quivering with excitement. Brooke stopped when they were face to face. Her
falling hair tickled Sam's nose. </p>
<p>"What we both want, Sammy," Brooke answered as she leaned down
to capture Sam's lips in a searing kiss. Sam moaned as the kiss deepened.
</p>
<p>"Oh God," she gasped as Brooke's hand snaked under her shirt
and cupped her left breast. "Oh God," she repeated as she rolled to the side to
reverse their positions? </p>
<p>?And promptly landed on the floor. Thankfully a pile of
clothes and stuffed animals broke her fall but unfortunately it served to wake
her up from the rather pleasant dream she was having. She growled and stomped
her feet in frustration. </p>
<p>"That is SO not fair," she complained to no one in particualr
except maybe the cruel and mischievious gods who did that to her. {=)} She
picked herself up off the floor and sat back down on her bed with a heavy sigh.
Knowing that the person she wanted the most, more than the air she breathed
even, was lying in bed asleep only twenty feet away was like slow torture. She
ran a shaky hand through her tousled hair and whimpered. </p>
<p>(I hate my life) she repeated her mantra as she scooted under
her covers. (Who did I piss off in a past life to get handed this?) she wondered
as she yawned and drifted off again, hoping to pick up where she left off. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Saaaaaaaaaaaam," Brooke moaned within her own bedroom. Her
own mind and imagination was fueling a set of vivid dreams for her as well. She
tossed and turned on the bed until finally sitting straight up with a final "Oh
God!" </p>
<p>She sat panting for a few seconds and regathering her wits.
Belatedly, she looked to make sure her doors were shut. </p>
<p>(Yeah, I need Sam to hear me if I cried out) she thought
ruefully. (I'd never hear the end of it. She'd print it on the front page of the
school newspaper) Yeah, she could just see that one now. (High School Popularity
Queen is a Lesbian would be one possiblity for the headline, if Sam were in a
generous mood) she laughed bitterly to herself. She flopped back onto the bed
with a heavy sigh. </p>
<p>(I love you but can't have you, Sam. And it isn't fair. Why do
we keep ourselves at arm's length? Why won't you let me close?) she wondered as
she closed her eyes. She didn't care that they were both girls. In Brooke's
opinion, love was love and gender be damned if the two people involved felt the
same. And she'd give anything for Sam to feel for her an iota of what she felt
for Sam. But she knew that was a virtual impossiblity. </p>
<p>(Sam is Sam and because of that, will never feel anything for
me other than begrudging friendship, if I'm lucky) Brooke reminded herself. She
drifted off to sleep hoping to continue where she left off. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam's alarm clock blared in her ear early the next morning.
She glared at the device and decided that it was truly an evil contraption to be
shouting the words from the Rolling Stone's "I Can't Get No (Satisfaction)" at
her like it was mocking her. (How appropriate) she mused sardonically to herself
as she rolled out of bed and padded into the bathroom. Brooke entered the room
at about the same moment and they were suddenly engaged in a silent staring
contest. </p>
<p>Brooke stared at Sam, looking so adorable in her blue cow
print pajamas while Sam stared at Brooke looking sultry in her pink silk pajamas.
Neither was able to vocalize properly. Sam bit down on her lip in nervousness as
Brooke stifled a groan but neither had broken eye contact yet. They were both
momentarily frozen in place by the mere presence of the other and their minds
were filled with the visions from their dreams. Finally, Brooke looked away
first, afraid that if she didn't, she was going to pounce Sam right there. She
wondered when her hormones had gained control over her higher brain functions
and why she wasn't informed. </p>
<p>Sam was desperately trying to resist the urge to pin Brooke to
the wall and have her way with her right then and there. She saw Brooke look
away and breathed a silent sigh of relief that the contact between them and
therefore the tension building was broken. </p>
<p>"What is your mental damage, McQueen?" she snapped to take
attention off her own momentary mental lapse. Brooke shook her head as Sam's
words registered. </p>
<p>"Good morning to you too, you brat," she snapped back, loving
the rush of adrenaline she was feeling. Sam's eyebrows raised. </p>
<p>"Brat? You're one to talk, Queenie. Are you suffering from
multiple personality disorder or what, lately? I keep waiting for you to refer
to yourself as Sybil." </p>
<p>"Oh, ha ha, you are so witty and well-read, Sam," Brooke
scoffed sarcastically. "And exactly what do you mean by that?" </p>
<p>"Well, one minute you're nice to me the next you're Queen
Bitch from the depths of Hell and then you look at me like I'm Gina Gershon from
Showgirls doing a private showing and then like the last meal of the Donner
party. Make up your freaking mind or at least call ahead and let me know what to
expect!" Sam told her exasperated. </p>
<p>"Excuse you but if anyone has the market cornered on mood
swings, Sam, it's you! You're the one who goes from zero to bitch in 2.3
seconds," Brooke argued. "I do not!" Sam countered."You do too. God, you have no
emotions unless it's anger or sarcasm, which isn't really an emotion. What does
that say about you?" she asked to bait Sam. Sam turned to walk away. </p>
<p>"Whatever," she mumbled. </p>
<p>"Yeah run away like you always do, Sammy," Brooke taunted,
making Sam spin back around to face her with an angry expression on her face. </p>
<p>"What?" she growled. Brooke smiled evilly. </p>
<p>"You heard me, you're a coward, Sam. Everytime things get too
personal or too close for comfort, you run away like a dog with your tail
between your legs," Brooke added as Sam's face turned red. She advanced on
Brooke slowly, a dangerous glint in her eye making Brooke's heart race and her
head feel light. </p>
<p>"You have no idea what I do or do not feel," Sam hissed lowly.
"Don't you DARE presume you do! You have no idea who I am," she informed Brooke
with tears in her eyes. Brooke's accusations had really hurt. Brooke frowned as
she saw the hurt on Sam's face and realized she'd pushed too far. </p>
<p>"Sam?" she started to apologize. Sam raised her hand to shut
her up and walked away again. </p>
<p>"Just shut up," she snapped at Brooke. "Don't talk to me.
EVER." </p>
