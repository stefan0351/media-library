<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Chapter Twenty -->

<p>They returned home two weeks later when Sam, although still sick, was well enough to travel. She still felt bad that she had ?ruined? Brooke?s trip despite the blonde cheerleader?s assurances that she had had a terrific time up until the storm and everything that followed. Brooke also promised that once Sam was well and they had the time, they would give it another go. Sam was looking forward to it.</p>
<p>A few days after returning home, Sam reluctantly dialed Nicole?s number and waited for her ?girlfriend? to pick up.</p>
<p>"You?re wasting my time, talk," Nicole barked into the phone.</p>
<p>"Nic, it?s Sam," Sam said, her voice still fading in and out slightly as she spoke.</p>
<p>"Oh?" there was silence on the other end of the phone for a few moments. "How are you feeling?"</p>
<p>"Not bad I guess," Sam shrugged although Nicole couldn?t see her. "Chest hurts from coughing and I still have a slight headache but I?m managing."</p>
<p>"I?m glad. Look, Sam, I really am sorry," Nicole started to apologize.</p>
<p>"I know," Sam cut her off. "Look, I didn?t call to force an apology out of you. I called to make sure we were clear. You and I are over, as in the past, over and done, has been. You know that right?" A heavy sigh was her only response for a minute.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I figured as much. You?re going with the Princess now, I take it?" Nicole said unable to keep the sneer from her voice.</p>
<p>"Brooke and I haven?t even begun to discuss anything. And FYI, it?s none of your business," Sam retorted. She was about to say more when a coughing fit cut her off and she took a few seconds to catch her breath.</p>
<p>"Ow. Anyway, I?m only calling you Nicole to make sure you knew that we?re over. And to make sure you know two more things. One, I don?t blame you for what happened. I shouldn?t have gone storming off in a place I wasn?t familiar with especially when I was angry. I tend to let my anger get the better of me sometimes. But that?s beside the point. The other thing you need to know? Stay the Hell away from me and Brooke," Sam snarled, her formerly friendly voice suddenly cold.</p>
<p>"You knew how she felt and used it against her. That?s inexcusable," she declared. "You truly are a heartless wench, you know that?"</p>
<p>"Sam?" Nicole started as tears began to run down her face.</p>
<p>"Save it. There are no excuses for what you did, Nicole. She was your best friend. She confided in you and you betrayed her. That?s the worst thing you could have done. And whatever little plan you were trying to get away with? It won?t work. Whether or not Brooke and I become an item, we?re still more than enough to handle you. Good-bye." She slammed down the phone and wiped away her own tears.</p>
<p>"That couldn?t have been easy," Brooke said quietly from the doorway. Sam turned to face her. </p>
<p>"It wasn?t. I did kinda like her. In a perverse sort of way now that I think about it," Sam mock shuddered. Brooke walked slowly into the room, eyeing Sam carefully.</p>
<p>"Soooooo," she drawled. "What about us?" Sam arched an eyebrow at her and reclined on her bed.</p>
<p>"What about us?" she parroted. Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"Please don?t play obstinate, Sam. You know what I mean." Sam bowed her head.</p>
<p>"Did you mean it?" she asked, her voice hushed and vulnerable. "When you said that you loved me, did you mean it? Or did you just say it to bring me back?" Brooke realized that Sam?s reluctance to talk stemmed from her doubt over what was said. She closed the space between them in three quick steps and reached down to tilt Sam?s face up to meet her own.</p>
<p>"I meant it, Sam. With every fiber of my being, God, I meant it," she said firmly watching as unshed tears welled up in Sam?s eyes but stubbornly refused to spill over.</p>
<p>"Why didn?t you tell me? Why did I almost have to die for you to find the ability to say it?" Sam wept as the tears won out and streaked down her face. They were mirrored on Brooke?s face as she wiped Sam?s away with her thumbs.</p>
<p>"I?m so so sorry, Sammy. I should have said something but I let my fear get in my way. And then Nicole got in my way and I really DIDN?T want to make you chose," she started to explain.</p>
<p>"What?s to chose? I love YOU! I have always loved YOU!" Sam declared. Brooke dropped to her knees in front of Sam.</p>
<p>"I would have chosen you," Sam finished in a whisper.</p>
<p>"Oh Sammy," Brooke sighed through her tears. "Thank you." Sam sniffled.</p>
<p>"Thank you for saving my life, Brooke," she said gently. Brooke looked up, locking her hazel eyes with Sam?s watery brown ones.</p>
<p>"Sam, I?" Sam placed her fingers over Brooke?s lips to stop her from speaking.</p>
<p>"Shhh, Brooke. I know, and I love you too," she said with a bright smile. She cupped the sides of Brooke?s face with her palms and drew their faces together. Their first kiss was gentle and tentative, full of love and promise. It lit them both from within and made all the pain worth it.</p>
<p>"God, Sammy," Brooke breathed leaning her forehead against Sam?s as tears of happiness fell down both their cheeks. "You make me so happy."</p>
<p>"So do you," Sam answered. "And I have to confess, in all, Brooke, this was the best vacation I?ve ever had. Thank you." Brooke wrapped her arms around Sam?s waist and rested her head on Sam?s chest, listening to the reassuring heartbeat beneath her ear. She couldn?t remember ever being happier than she was in that one moment. She had Sam and she had Sam?s love. Her life was complete.</p>
<p>"You are more than welcome, Sammy. I love you," she said, just to make sure Sam knew. Sam tightened her own hold on the slender blonde.</p>
<p>"I love you too," she whispered as she scooted up on the bed taking Brooke with her. They fell asleep like that, wrapped completely around each other, contented for the first time in a long time. They both had what they wanted and there was nothing more in the way of their happiness.</p>
