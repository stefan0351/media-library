<!-- A Year In The Life \ Prologue -->

<p>Brooke finished putting away her clean clothes and smiled as
she heard the soft thump thump of music coming from Sam's room.
Their fun summer of trips together had given way to a relaxed autumn
at home. Their friends had for the most part, all scattered to start
college leaving Brooke and Sam somewhat to themselves. Sam sometimes
likened it to being left at the starting gate of a race. Not that
they minded. They both knew they weren't ready for the grueling push
of college just yet and still needed time to heal from the events of
the past year or so.</p>

<p>&lt;And time to just be us for a change&gt; she smiled to herself.
She walked across their shared bathroom and stood in the doorway to
Sam's room, watching the slim brunette dance and sing softly with her
radio. Again Brooke was taken with the simple yet delicate grace of
the other girl. The images of Sam lying injured both on Prom night
and in gym class flashed across her mind but seemed to contrast
sharply with the mobile and energetic person in front of her. And
the fact that Sam was cleaning and not missing a beat of the music as
she bounced across the floor was amusing.</p>

<p>"?hit me with your eighteen wheeler truck and I won't give
a?" Sam sang happily.</p>

<p>"Hey Gorgeous," Brooke whispered as she wrapped her arms
around Sam from behind. Sam giggled.</p>

<p>"Hiya Princess," she greeted in response. "What can I do for
you?" Brooke buried her face in Sam's thick mane of dark hair for a
moment before she answered. She seemed to purr into Sam's neck,
which made Sam shiver.</p>

<p>"Mmmmmmmm," Brooke sighed happily. She reluctantly pulled
away and sat on Sam's bed, keeping hold of Sam's hands as Sam stood
in front of her.</p>

<p>"I wanted to talk to you, actually, Sammy," she confessed.
Sam smirked.</p>

<p>"I'm all ears, Princess."</p>

<p>"I'll refrain from comment," Brooke teased. Sam stuck out
her tongue in response. Brooke's face then turned serious, a frown
marring her features. "Are you happy, my Sammy?"</p>

<p>A warm smile slowly spread across Sam's face. She pulled one
hand away from Brooke's and gently caressed one side of the blonde's
face.</p>

<p>"More than I ever have been," she responded softly. "You?"
Brooke nodded while leaning into Sam's warm hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, very."</p>

<p>"I'm glad," Sam murmured happily as her fingers danced over
Brooke's nose. Brooke pulled her closer and she rested her head
against Sam's abdomen.</p>

<p>"Sammy, can I move in with you?" Brooke asked innocently.
Sam couldn't help the bark of laughter that escaped her. Brooke
jumped and looked up at her confused. "What's so funny?"</p>

<p>"Sorry," Sam apologized. "It just seemed silly for a second,
Princess. We already live in the same house." Brooke tugged Sam to
sit on the bed next to her. She wrapped her arms around Sam and
cuddled up to her as they sat.</p>

<p>"I know, but?I want to share a room with you, Sammy," Brooke
elaborated. "I hate the nights when we sleep apart. When you're not
there I can't sleep. I toss and turn and reach out for you but the
bed is so empty without you. I want to go to bed each night with you
and see you first thing in the morning."</p>

<p>"Aww, I'd love that too," Sam agreed. "But, Mike isn't going
to go for it."</p>

<p>"We'll beg, plead and whatever," Brooke declared. "Come on,
you have to admit that it makes sense. We're in a relationship.
Half the time we end up in the same bed anyway. This will just make
it easier." Sam was quiet as she thought.</p>

<p>"Neither of our beds is really big enough for us both, long
term," she realized.</p>

<p>"We'll buy a new one," Brooke announced. "Or cuddle a lot,"
she joked. Sam giggled. </p>

<p>"Which room do you want to make `home'?"</p>

<p>"Yours," Brooke answered without hesitation. At Sam's
surprised look, she continued. "Well, it's where I stayed when you
were in the hospital and I just like it better. It's farthest from
our parents and gets the best light. Besides, it just FEELS more
like `home'."</p>

<p>"I see," Sam muttered as she thought.</p>

<p>"Come on, please? We'll work it out," Brooke pleaded. She
desperately wanted this. She'd been wondering for a while why they
just didn't go ahead and do it. It seemed pointless to her to keep
their separate sleeping arrangements. </p>

<p>"We'll sleep in one room and keep our stuff in another," she
went on. "Please, please, please, with sugar and a cherry on top?"
Sam smirked impishly.</p>

<p>"How about you on top?" she teased. Brooke laughed.</p>

<p>"If that's what it takes," she agreed with a blush and a
slight leer. "Come on, Sam, you know you want this too."</p>

<p>"Hmm?OK, I'm all for it, Princess. If you can get your Dad
not to have a stroke or heart attack when you suggest it, I'm in,"
Sam said. Brooke hugged her tightly and then kissed her
passionately. </p>

<p>"Come on," she whispered as she pulled Sam down onto the bed.</p>

<p>"Princess, the door?it's not locked," Sam blushed. Brooke
laughed lowly.</p>

<p>"S'OK. I only want to take a nap with my girlfriend. No
funny stuff," she said as she snuggled closer to Sam. She yawned and
buried her head under Sam's.</p>

<p>"Sounds nice, Princess," Sam whispered as she kissed the top
of Brooke's head and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jane cautiously gave a gentle shove to her daughter's door
and was surprised to find it unlocked. Taking it as a sign that it
was `safe', she entered carrying the basket of clean laundry. She
was met by the most precious thing she'd seen in a long time.</p>

<p>Brooke and Sam had fallen asleep on top of the covers, face
to face and wrapped around each other barely a breath away. The two
girls looked so happy and content that it took Jane's breath away.</p>

<p>&lt;They really do complete each other&gt; she realized silently.
&lt;Who would have guessed that two girls that could barely stand each
other at one point would be so absolutely lost without the other?
And perfect love matches?&gt;</p>

<p>While at one point Jane did have her issues with the
relationship, mostly out of worry for both her girls, she had let
them go in view of the bigger picture.</p>

<p>Two halves of a soul finally made complete. And, to her, that's what
the love between Sam and Brooke truly was. It was a rare gift; and
it was a beautiful thing to witness. They'd been through so much and
yet continually came through the difficulties together. She was
slightly envious of them and could only hope that she and Mike had as
much potential as she saw in Sam and Brooke.</p>

<p>As quietly as she could, Jane set the basket down and then
pulled a blanket over the sleeping duo. They snuggled impossibly
closer under the covering and Jane smiled.</p>

<p>&lt;Sleep well, girls&gt; she thought to herself as she gently
closed the door. &lt;You've earned it&gt;</p>
