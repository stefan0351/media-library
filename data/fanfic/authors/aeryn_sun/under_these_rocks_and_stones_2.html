<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Mirror Dream -->

<p>Brooke stared dumbly at the blank sheet of paper in front of
her. Some dim part of her brain kept telling her that she really should be
trying to write her history paper. But the larger part of her brain, the part
presently in control, kept replaying the conversation that she'd overheard
between Sam and Lily. Or at least one part in particular. </p>
<p>((("Not to rub it in, but same as you, someone and something I
can never have," Sam said almost as a sob to Brooke's ears from the doorway. </p>
<p>"Brooke," Lily whispered in awe. "You're in love with Brooke."
There was a long pause and Brooke had wished she could have seen Sam's face to
know for sure her reaction. </p>
<p>"I don't believe it, you're gay," Lily breathed. Brooke
hitched in a breath as well at the revelation. </p>
<p>"Oh, sure fine. You decide to `out' yourself in the school
newspaper office and then decide to take me with you. Gee, thanks," Sam snarled,
sounding to Brooke both offended and relieved. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Sam, just shocked is all," Lily apologized.
"You're in love with Brooke," she repeated. </p>
<p>"That's not something you keep throwing in someone's face,
Lily," Sam snapped this time sounding hurt and forlorn. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry, really, I'll shut up now," Lily offered
sympathetically. "Shock, honest. I was shocked." Sam sighed deeply. </p>
<p>"I know, so was I," she admitted sadly. There was another long
pause and again Brooke wished she could have seen the faces of both girls and
known what was going on in both their minds. </p>
<p>"But you can never have her, huh?" Lily asked quietly.
</p>
<p>"Unless you know something I don't, no," Sam tried to joke but
it fell flat and Brooke could hear the tears in her voice. "Brooke's waiting for
Mr. Right, not Ms. Maybe who also happens to almost be her stepsister."))) </p>
<p>Sam loved her, as in was IN love WITH her and she had
absolutely no idea what to do. She was shocked, dismayed, mildly disturbed,
oddly flattered, and something else. Something else that she didn't dare try and
put a name on just now. As it was, she was too busy trying to calm the seemingly
permanent case of the butterflies she seemed to have contracted. </p>
<p>(So what do I do?) she fretted. (Do I confront Sam about it?
Then what? Embarrass the Hell out of us both and listen to her yell at me over
respecting other people's privacy?) That definitely didn't sound like fun. </p>
<p>(I could tell Nic.) that thought was crushed before it fully
formed. Brooke was well aware of what Nicole would do to both Sam and Lily if
she found out about this. Complete and utter destruction would be a sunny day
picnic compared to what Nic could dish out once she sunk her pearly whites into
this juicy info. And as rattled as Brooke was over this, she genuinely liked
both girls and was not about to hand over the keys to the ammunition locker
needed to ultimately destroy both girls to Nicole Julian. </p>
<p>Her stomach fluttered again and she found herself caught
between the urge to vomit or giggle. Very strange sensation that. She eventually
went with the giggle though. The irony and absurdity of the situation struck
her. It was a very attractive if somewhat lopsided love triangle. </p>
<p>(Lily loves Sam, Sam loves me and I love.I love.who the Hell
do I love?) she wondered. Not Josh, that was so over it was pathetic. Not
Harrison, sure he was sweet and nice and all but there was no spark, no fire.
Truthfully, no one really did it for her lately. There was no one that she spent
a lot of time thinking about or spending time with except maybe. </p>
<p>She was broken from her musings by a soft rap on her door
followed by it opening and Sam walking in. </p>
<p>"Brooke, have you seen my Bio text?" she asked calmly as she
strode into the room. Brooke let out a cry of surprise and threw herself against
the headboard of her bed where she'd been sitting. Sam cocked her head to the
side and arched an eyebrow. </p>
<p>"OOOOOKKKKKK, next time, I'd go for the sugar-free and
decaffinated," she recommended with a smirk as Brooke stared at her. </p>
<p>(How can she act so calm if what I heard is true?) Brooke
wondered. Sam looked at her plainly, like she always did. But as Brooke looked
closer, she could see something else in Sam's eyes. It was very well hidden but
if you knew what you were looking for you might be able to see it. It was an
extra spark, a flare directed solely at Brooke. And it lit Sam up from within to
the point that she almost seemed to glow. Brooke felt her heart begin to speed
up. </p>
<p>(How did I miss it all this time?) she asked herself as she
continued to stare into Sam's brown eyes as Sam waited for her to answer.
(Because you weren't looking) she reasoned. Somewhere in her mind she figured it
really wasn't good to be having conversations with herself like that.
</p>
<p>"So, have you seen it? I left it on the kitchen table and
figured maybe you picked it up by mistake," Sam explained from a few feet away,
breaking Brooke from her inner dialogue for which she was thankful. </p>
<p>(Damn, the girl deserves an Oscar) Brooke decided. Sam was
acting so cool, so natural that Brooke would have never have known that she had
deep feelings for her if she hadn't had overheard that conversation. (And I
really need to start speaking outloud) Brooke picked through the books stacked
on her bed and found Sam's text. </p>
<p>"Here, sorry," she apologized. Sam shrugged and walked over. </p>
<p>"No problem, simple mistake," she reached out to grab the book
and their hands touched. A jolt of pure energy ran from Sam's fingertips into
Brooke's, up Brooke's arm, across her chest momentarily cutting off her air, and
pooled in her abdomen in a fuzzy ache. It wasn't at all an unpleasant feeling.
If Sam had experienced the same thing or noticed Brooke's reaction, she didn't
let on. </p>
<p>"Whatcha working on?" Sam asked as she sat on the edge of the
bed, a discrete distance away, Brooke noticed. Brooke wrinkled her nose.
</p>
<p>"History paper," she answered in distaste. Sam looked at the
blank paper. </p>
<p>"Looks like you're getting a lot of work done too," she said
sarcastically. Brooke raspberried her. </p>
<p>"I got a lot on my mind is all," she retorted. Sam laughed. </p>
<p>"Hmmm, should I wear the new Versace or the Donna Karen on my
next date?" she said in a mock Brooke voice. Brooke glared at her. </p>
<p>"Can you go more than two seconds without attacking my
character or not?" Brooke snapped. Sam looked away, ashamed. </p>
<p>"Sorry," she apologized. "Old habits die hard." She looked
back up, a half smile on her face. "Or you can't teach an old dog new tricks."
Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"Sam, we're both learning our new `tricks' as you so
eloquently put it, just fine. And I've got to learn to stop being so damn
sensitive, you were only kidding," she said with a shake of her head. She hadn't
meant to snap but the whole `Sam is in love with me' thing had her tied up in
knots with no idea which end was up anymore. Sam nodded and stood up.
</p>
<p>"I'll let you get back to work. I gotta do my Bio homework and
finish an article for the paper anyway. Later," Sam said as she exited the room.
Brooke watched her go. </p>
<p>"Later," she called to Sam's back. After Sam was gone, Brooke
flopped back down on her bed and pulled the pillow over her head. (Now what do I
do?) </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke was in the bathroom brushing her teeth when Sam walked
in, an intense look on her face. She stopped behind Brooke and glared at her
though the mirror. The glare could have melted steel, in Brooke's opinion. She
hadn't seen Sam that mad in a long time. Brooke looked back in confusion. She
hadn't spoken to or seen Sam since giving her back her Bio book the night
before, what could have set her off? She set down her toothbrush and shrugged. </p>
<p>"What's wrong with you? Wake up on the wrong side of the bed,
McPherson?" she asked. Sam stepped a few feet closer until she was right up
against Brooke's back. </p>
<p>"I know," Sam growled. Brooke continued to look at Sam through
the mirror trying to figure out what was going on. </p>
<p>"You know what?" she asked, starting to get a little afraid.
Sam put her hands on Brooke's shoulders and held her in place as she leaned in
closer. </p>
<p>"I know that you heard me and Lily talking," she whispered
softer this time in Brooke's ear. Brooke shivered and her heart began to race.
"I know you know." Brooke looked at the mirror Sam and saw the anger was gone,
replaced by something else. Something else that frightened Brooke because she
wasn't sure that she was ready for it just yet. She tried to pull away from Sam
but the grip was too tight. </p>
<p>"Let me go, Sam," she asked, hoping not to sound like she was
begging. Sam instantly let go. Brooke put her hands on the sink in front of her
to steady herself. She was shaking and didn't understand why. </p>
<p>"You heard us, didn't you?" Sam asked in her normal voice
looking at Brooke with a serene if pleading look on her face. Brooke nodded
reluctantly, vocal chords nonresponsive at that moment. Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"Now what?" Brooke asked when she could speak. She watched Sam
shrug in the mirror. </p>
<p>"I dunno, this, I guess," Sam said as she grabbed Brooke again
and spun her around. Brooke was powerless to stop her as Sam buried one hand in
the blonde's hair and brought their lips together for a burning kiss. Nothing in
any of Brooke's previous experience could have prepared her for this kiss. It
was full of hunger, love, desire and need and yet was the most gentle thing
she'd ever experienced. She moaned as Sam deepened the kiss and she wrapped her
arms around Sam's shorter frame. She began to lose herself in the feeling until
a small part of her brain decided to kick back in and she roughly pushed Sam
away a few minutes later. </p>
<p>"Sam," she panted breathlessly. She looked at Sam who was
staring at her confused. "I can't. I mean we can't.I mean I don't know.oh Hell,
I don't know what I mean," she finally managed with a sigh. She ran a hand
through her jumbled hair. Sam took a step forward and Brooke took a step back. </p>
<p>"Sam we can't," she warned. Sam frowned. </p>
<p>"Why not?" she asked simply. "You seemed to be enjoying it a
moment ago." Brooke nodded. (OK, she's got me there. Damn she's a good
kisser.now, what was my reasoning again?) </p>
<p>"Because I don't know what I want," she answered honestly. Sam
looked hurt and Brooke felt a stab of pain at putting that look there. The look
passed quickly and Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"That's OK. You decide what you want and until then, I've got
Lily," she said nonchalantly as she walked back out the door to her room. Brooke
went after her but the door shut in her face. </p>
<p>"OK, now I'm confused," Brooke said outloud. "What the Hell
just happened and what did she mean by that?" </p>
<p>"Subconscious desires are making themselves known, that's
what," another voice told her. Brooke spun around to see her mirror image
speaking to her and not looking too terribly happy, either. Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"I'm dreaming, aren't I?" Mirror Brooke clapped sarcastically. </p>
<p>"Look, beauty AND brains, gee, we're a complete package,
whoopie," Mirror Brooke quipped. Brooke had decided already she didn't like this
part of herself. "Yeah, I don't like you either, Toots." </p>
<p>"OK, fine," Brooke sighed to herself, literally. "Just tell me
what's going on so that I can either go back to dreaming something pleasant or
wake up." Mirror Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Fine, don't gotta be a Snotski about it, brat," Mirror Brooke
complained. "Look, it's like this. You just had a shock to your system. Ya just
found out that your once mortal enemy and now soon-to-be-stepsister, Sam, is
deeply in love with you. Now normally that would play havok with anyone's sense
of cosmic balance but since you've been playing the denial game since the age of
thirteen then." </p>
<p>"What the Hell are you talking about?" Brooke snapped. Mirror
Brooke sighed. The conscious mind could be such a pain in the ass sometimes. </p>
<p>"Denial is NOT a river in Egypt, babe," Mirror Brooke
explained none too patiently. "You've had your groove on for Sam McPherson since
before you knew what the groove was for." Brooke gaped at her mirror image in
shock and horror. </p>
<p>"I have NOT!" she yelled. Mirror Brooke rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Babe, subconscious here, ain't no lying to me. I know all
your truths. All the real ones, the ones you don't either know about or want to
acknowledge and you have had it bad for Sam since you were little. But you
didn't understand it so you pushed it down here. And then as you got older, you
had a part to play and the feelings didn't fit so you repressed them further.
Guess what? Hearing Sam's little confession has poked a little hole in the dam,
babe, and unless you got a LOT of super glue, there's no going back now. It's
growing and more little holes are springing up everywhere. Your dyke has sprung
a leak." Mirror Brooke laughed at her own very bad joke. Brooke glared at the
mirror. </p>
<p>"I don't believe you," she hissed. Mirror Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"Doesn't matter what you believe or not, sugar. You dreamed
that little bathroom escapade, not me. You want Sam to know that you know so
that the pressure is off of you to tell her." </p>
<p>"I can't do this," Brooke ranted as she started to pace.
Mirror Brooke watched and sighed. </p>
<p>"Oh, whatever. Look, you have two choices: You can keep doing
this, denying yourself what you want until you lose her," Brooke snapped her
head up to look at her mirror image. "Because that will eventually happen. Sam
may love you but eventually she'll see that she can never have you because you
won't let her. She can't live her entire life alone, Brooke. That's not fair.
And it's not fair for you to expect her to wait until you iron out whatever
issues it is that you have. So she'll probably turn to the one person who she
knows will return her love." </p>
<p>"Lily," Brooke breathed. For some reason, that hurt. Mirror
Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Exactly. Lily already told Sam that she loves her and doesn't
care about playing second fiddle to you. She just wants Sam." </p>
<p>"And my second choice?" Brooke asked. Mirror Brooke smiled. </p>
<p>"Walk through that door and tell Sam that you know. And that
you love her too." Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"It's not that easy," she lamented. </p>
<p>"Why? Because of your `popularity'? Your `social status'?"
Brooke nodded. "God, screw it, Brooke, isn't your happiness more important?"
Mirror Brooke asked angrily. Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"I don't know," she answered honestly. Mirror Brooke shook her
head. </p>
<p>"You've got bigger problems than I thought. I do have one
piece of good news though," Brooke picked her head back up. Mirror Brooke smiled
devilishly. "This IS a dream, and she's waiting for you on the other side of
that door." The door to Sam's room slowly opened and hesitantly at first, Brooke
started over to it. Mirror Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"It's only a dream, Brooke. No harm in indulging in a little
fantasy," she reassured her more restrained self. Brooke smiled at her mirror
image and walked over to the door and went through, closing it behind her.
Mirror Brooke sighed again. </p>
<p>"That girl is seriously screwed up." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke's alarm woke her later and she rolled over and slapped
it off. (That was definitely a STRANGE night. Did I eat something that didn't
agree with me?) she wondered. As she got out of bed and padded over to the
bathroom she reran the night's events. </p>
<p>(OK, I dreamed that I kissed Sam and enjoyed it, strange
factor #1. Had an indepth discussion with my subconscious whom I really don't
like, strange factor #2, had wild passionate sex with Dream Sam, ahem,
repeatedly, strange factor #3, and oddly enough, the only thing that really
bothers me is the fact that my alarm went off WAY too early this morning. I've
got issues, BIG issues. What do I do now?) </p>
<p>"Morning, Brooke, sleep well?" Sam asked from the sink, making
Brooke jump in surprise. She blinked at Sam a few times trying to chase the
images from her dreams away and actually focus on the person standing in front
of her with a rather peculiar smirk on her face. </p>
<p>"Uh, yeah, I guess so," Brooke stuttered in response. Sam
smirk grew into a grin. </p>
<p>"Yeah, it sounded it," Sam giggled. Brooke's eyes grew wide
and she stared at Sam. "Oh, relax, you didn't scream in bliss or anything. I got
up for a glass of water and well, your door was open and I heard some noises,"
Sam blushed a deep red crimson and so did Brooke. They both desperately wished
Sam's mouth would shut, but it didn't. "I went directly back to bed, you know, I
didn't listen. I'm not sick. And it's not like it doesn't happen to everyone
else." Brooke saw her opening to embarrass Sam like she was embarrassed.
</p>
<p>"Oh, really? Do you? Have sex dreams, I mean?" she asked
trying to take the spotlight off her own discomfort. But Sam saw her way out. </p>
<p>"Admitting you were having a sex-dream?" she shot back
playfully. Brooke groaned when she realized she caught herself in her own line
of questioning. Sam took pity and let Brooke off the hook. </p>
<p>"Forget I said anything, Brooke," she said, handing Brooke the
toothpaste. "Seriously, did you get your history paper written?" Brooke shook
her head. </p>
<p>"Half," she grumbled. "I'll finish it in study hall, I hope.
How about you?" Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Got my stuff done," she said as she fixed her hair. Brooke
frowned and looked at the wall-clock. </p>
<p>"You know, you're up awful early," she pointed out. Sam
smiled. </p>
<p>"I'm meeting Lily for breakfast," Sam told her. The warning
that she could lose Sam to Lily if she waited too long echoed in Brooke's head. </p>
<p>"Do you think she'd mind an extra this morning?" she asked
hopefully. Sam looked surprised but shook her head. </p>
<p>"I don't think she'd mind. I think Carmen might be there too,
I'm not sure. Can you be ready in like ten?" Brooke nodded. "Yeah, believe it
when I see it." Brooke stuck out her tongue. </p>
<p>"Shoo, then and let me shower, Sam," she all but bodily
removed Sam from the bathroom, the temptation of asking her to join her almost
overwhelming. </p>
<p>"All right, all right, I'm going, I'm going. Gosh, pushy
pushy," Sam grumbled with a laugh as Brooke shut the door behnd her. Brooke
didn't know what possessed her to ask to go with Sam and Lily to breakfast but
she had to and she didn't know what she was going to do about these feelings for
Sam that were beginning to make themselves known. She walked over to the sink
and stared intently at her reflection. </p>
<p>"Well, Smarty-Pants, any suggestions?" </p>
