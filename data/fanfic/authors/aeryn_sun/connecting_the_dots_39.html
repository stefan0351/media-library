<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Thirty Nine -->

<p>Sam sat thumping her pencil against her paper during her Trig final. Nothing was making sense and she was sure she was watching her academic future circle the porcelain drain.</p>
<p>&lt;Should have studied more, damnit. Damn, why does Brooke have to look so hot in those jeans? Are those the same ones I wore LAST YEAR? Oh she did that on purpose! The rat!&gt; She tore her eyes away from her concentrating girlfriend and tried to place her divided attention back on her test.</p>
<p>&lt;God, what is wrong with me? I'm like a horny 18 year-old boy. Only difference is I'm a 17 year-old GIRL! Shit, I'm almost out of time here. Time to start the guessing. When in doubt, the answer is C&gt; She started making random patterns on the bubble sheet just to fill in the spaces. She filled in the last one just as the buzzer went off.</p>
<p>"That's it. Pencils down, hand your papers in," the teacher barked. As Sam handed in hers, the teacher smirked.</p>
<p>"Ms McPherson, if all else fails, you can always see if Spinal Tap needs a new drummer." Sam groaned and slumped her shoulders.</p>
<p>"I'll have your test results by the end of the day for those of you who care," the teacher called after them as they left.</p>
<p>Sam banged her head into her locker repeatedly.</p>
<p>"Stop that," Brooke scolded. "I'm the one with dain bramage, remember?" She managed to get Sam to smile with that one.</p>
<p>"Ug, I blew that one," Sam complained. "I think I managed to draw Mickey Mouse out of the bubbles though."</p>
<p>"Aw, Sammy," Brooke sighed. "Your grades should float you though, right?" Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'll get by. Barely," she added angst-filled. "At least it's almost over."</p>
<p>"I only have history left. You?"</p>
<p>"Sociology," Sam said. "Then our high school careers are over." Brooke leaned over and kissed her.</p>
<p>"For luck, Sammy," she whispered. Sam smiled and kissed her back.</p>
<p>"Yeah, for luck," she repeated.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>It was over almost before Sam realized it. She handed in her Sociology final and it hit her: High school was over, done with. No more getting up at the obscene crack of dawn to fight her way through the faceless masses and social caste system trying to get by until the end. This WAS the end. And suddenly, she felt a weight leave her chest. </p>
<p>&lt;OK, college starts in the fall but, for now, it's over&gt; she thought giddily. &lt;I have the entire summer to spend with Brooke just doing nothing. Oh Heaven&gt;</p>
<p>She walked out of the room and was met by a grinning Brooke outside the door.</p>
<p>"We're free! We're free!" Brooke chirped, summing up how Sam felt perfectly. Sam laughed and engulfed the blonde in a happy hug.</p>
<p>"I know! Ain't it great?" Brooke tugged on Sam's arm when they broke apart.</p>
<p>"Come on, I want to know how I did on the Trig final," she said. Sam planted her feet and refused to move.</p>
<p>"Broooooooooke, I blew that one. Can't I postpone the agony until our report cards arrive in the mail?" she whined with a pout. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, it's better to know now, Sammy. Besides, it'll give you more time to come up with an excuse as to why you blew it," she reasoned. Sam started walking behind Brooke, easily defeated.</p>
<p>"I can't say to Mom and Mike: `Brooke wore a pair of jeans that fit her like a second skin and I couldn't take my eyes off her ass long enough to concentrate'?" Brooke burst out laughing again.</p>
<p>"No, I think that comes under the heading of `too much personal information', hon," she pointed out.</p>
<p>"Oh poo," Sam complained.</p>
<p>They arrived back at their former Trig class where the teacher was giving April Tuna her `A'. He looked up and glared hotly at Sam. She exchanged a confused look with Brooke and shrugged.</p>
<p>"I supposed you two are here for your grades?" he asked snidely. Both girls nodded as April scuttled past them, a triumphant look on her face.</p>
<p>"Well, Ms McQueen, no surprise but you got an `A' on the final. That makes your final grade also an `A' in this class. I'll admit, I wasn't sure if you'd be able to maintain the same grade point average after your accident that you had had in past years but I'm pleased to see otherwise." Brooke beamed proudly. The teacher then turned his kind look back into a glare and focused it on Sam.</p>
<p>"Ms McPherson," he ground out and Sam swallowed hard. Her heart was beating wildly in her chest and she was positive that this guy was about to tell her that he'd see her next year when she repeated the class.</p>
<p>"I don't know HOW you managed to pull it off. I was watching you so I know you weren't cheating but somehow you managed, in those last moments of frantically filling in bubbles, to pull a `B+' out of your hat." Sam stared at the teacher in shock.</p>
<p>"I what?" she asked.</p>
<p>"You received a `B+' on my final, Ms McPherson. It hardly seems fair that someone who simply filled in random bubbles did better then say, Lily Esposito, who no doubt studied. You pass my class with a `B' average. Consider yourself lucky, young lady." Sam nodded dumbly as Brooke thanked the teacher and led her from the room. </p>
<p>"Jesus, Sam, you are the luckiest person I know," Brooke laughed as she held on to Sam's hand and walked towards the parking lot. Sam was still stunned. She got in the car just shaking her head.</p>
<p>"So, that's it?" she wondered. Suddenly, instead of feeling relieved that it was over, she was feeling like she was robbed. "Kinda anti-climatic." Brooke smiled at her.</p>
<p>"What did you want, Sammy? A big musical finale?" she asked sarcastically but smiling. Sam pretended to act horrified.</p>
<p>"God, no. What do you think this is? Buffy: the Vampire Slayer?"</p>
