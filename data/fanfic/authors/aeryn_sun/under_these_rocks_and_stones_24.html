<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Double Date -->

<p>Brooke bounced excitedly on the balls of her feet as she knocked on the door of the motel room. She and Tyler had picked up Catherine ten minutes earlier and she'd been delighted with the idea of a double date with Sam and Brooke. She thought it was a great way for everyone to get what they wanted. Now the trick was to drag Sam out of the house on such short notice.</p>
<p>Brooke held her breath as Jane opened the door and gasped in surprise.</p>
<p>"Brooke, sweetheart, it's so good to see you!" she exclaimed hugging the blonde tightly. "What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"Can Sammy come out and play?" she asked cheekily. Jane laughed and then sighed.</p>
<p>"Come in, Brooke," she said. "She needs you." Brooke followed Jane in, a frown marring her delicate features. Worry radiated from every pore.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, Mom? Is she OK?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I've never seen her this bad, Brooke. And I don't know how to help her anymore. She won't talk or open up to me. She barely speaks or sleeps and I'm scared."</p>
<p>Brooke found Sam lying on her back on the bed, Mac sound asleep on her chest. It would have been a precious picture if not for the faded bruises on Sam's face and the cold, dull, unblinking stare. It sent chills of fear down Brooke's spine.</p>
<p>"Sammy?" she called out tentatively. Sam seemed to blink and return to herself at the sound of Brooke's voice. She turned to face Brooke and gave her a genuine and wide smile.</p>
<p>"Brooke, baby," she said softly as not to wake Mac. She watched Brooke intently at the door. Brooke loved those eyes. They normally said so much but right now, they were missing something. Something important and Brooke couldn't quite place what it was.</p>
<p>"Miss you," Brooke whispered back.</p>
<p>"You too," Sam answered.</p>
<p>"Oh thank God," Jane breathed as she left the two girls and baby alone. It was the most life she'd seen from Sam in quite a while and she was relieved to see it. Brooke sat down on the bed next to Sam and stroked the baby's hair.</p>
<p>"Whatcha doin'?" Brooke asked with a smirk. Sam smiled again.</p>
<p>"Thinking," she answered. Brooke nodded and reached up to touch Sam's cheek. She didn't like that Sam's skin seemed cooler than it should but she was glad that Sam seemed to lean into the warmth of her hand.</p>
<p>"About what?" Sam shrugged slightly with the baby on her chest. Mac snuggled closer to her brunette sister, still comfortably asleep.</p>
<p>"Nothing important," Sam said quietly but Brooke could see it wasn't the truth. She watched haunted shadows chase themselves across Sam's brown eyes and it hurt her to see that pain and fear in Sam. Sam was supposed to be the strong one, the confident one. But she simply seemed broken at the moment. Like her springs popped and her battery had run down. Brooke knew she needed to find a way to respark Sam.</p>
<p>"Wanna go out?" Brooke offered. Sam arched an eyebrow in question.</p>
<p>"What about your Dad?" Sam asked, a tinge of fear coloring her voice. It made Brooke's heart ache to hear.</p>
<p>"Technically, I'm supposed to be out on a date with some guy he set me up with," Brooke explained with a wry grin.</p>
<p>"Technically?" Sam echoed for clarification.</p>
<p>"Well, it turns out he would rather be out with his girlfriend and I would rather be out with mine. So we figured, why not double up since we were stuck together anyway?" she giggled. "So we were thinking mini golf, a movie, dinner...that sort of thing. What say you, Gorgeous?" Sam laughed, waking Mac up. The baby blinked fuzzily at Brooke and then yawned. Then recognizing the blonde, she held out her arms and Brooke gladly scooped her up.</p>
<p>"Hello, little one. How are you? I miss you," she cooed as Mac played with her hair and nose. At hearing Brooke's voice, Mac laughed and clapped happily.</p>
<p>"Looks like she missed you too," Sam pointed out. Brooke smiled broadly.</p>
<p>"I'm glad," she sighed. She turned back to Sam as Mac played happily in her arms. "So Sam, what do you say? Would you like to go out with me?" Sam seemed to think for a minute and Brooke was afraid that she was going to say 'no'. Then a slow smile spread across Sam's face.</p>
<p>"I'd love to."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>As promised there was a round of mini golf, won by Tyler and Catherine because Brooke and Sam were too occupied with each other to pay close enough attention. A quiet dinner followed and then they went to a late movie. An enjoyable time was had by all but although Brooke could see that Sam was having fun, she could also see a distinct lack of energy about the girl too. Her smiles didn't reach her eyes, her laugh wasn't as deep and there wasn't as much bounce to her step. To a casual observer it would have gone mostly unnoticed, but not to Brooke. Brooke had every one of Sam's nuances memorized. She knew when something wasn't right.</p>
<p>She decided to ask Sam about it as they sat a few rows away from Tyler and Catherine in the movie theater.</p>
<p>"Sammy," she whispered to the head nestled on her shoulder. "Are you OK?" She felt Sam nod.</p>
<p>"Mmmm hmmmm."</p>
<p>"Are you sure? I don't mean to be a nag or anything but you seem a little, I don't know...off," she tried again. Sam sighed, a heavy sound that made a lump form in Brooke's throat. She lifted her head so that her chin rested on Brooke's shoulder and she could look the blonde in the eyes.</p>
<p>"I'm tired, Brooke. And still a little sore," Sam explained. "I'm fine, don't worry about it."</p>
<p>"I can't help it, Sammy. I love you and I can tell something more is bothering you. You're getting so far away from me," Brooke tried to get her thoughts across to Sam. Sam leaned up and gave her a gentle kiss.</p>
<p>"I love you too. And I'm right here. Just enjoy the movie, Brooke. I'm not going anywhere." She put her head back down, signaling the end of the conversation. Brooke swallowed her frustrated sigh and turned back to the movie. She knew there was more going on than Sam was saying. She would just have to try to reach the distant brunette another time.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke buried her hands in Sam's curly hair as Sam slept against her side in the back-seat of Tyler's car on the way home. She loved the girl with all her heart but she was afraid that she was losing her. She wondered if she held on tight enough physically she could prevent it. But it was Sam's mind that seemed to be drifting further and further away. That brilliant mind that sparkled from behind clear, lucid brown eyes seemed clouded and mired in doubt and fear. And Brooke knew that her father was to blame for most of that.</p>
<p>As far as Brooke knew, such hatred and violence was foreign to Sam. From what she knew of Joe McPherson, he had been a loving and compassionate man, not a violent, close-minded monster like Mike McQueen. Brooke figured some of Sam's withdrawal had to stem from an absolute lack of experience in dealing with a loud, threatening father figure. And when confronted with it, Sam had no way of knowing how to cope with both Mike's anger or his violence so she was shutting down to protect herself. As Brooke thought about it and held the deceptively fragile girl closer in her arms, she realized that it made a lot of sense. But what didn't make sense was Sam shutting her out as well. That bothered her.</p>
<p>"You two are a sweet couple," Catherine said quietly from the front seat. Brooke gave her a small smile. She liked the girl. Catherine was nice, generous, and funny. She thought she and Tyler made a great couple and it was disappointing that something as asinine as racism was getting in the way of their happiness.</p>
<p>"Thanks," Brooke said.</p>
<p>"I think what's been done to the two of you is horrible," Catherine added. Brooke frowned in confusion. She hadn't said anything to her about the situation. Noticing the blonde's confusion, Catherine continued.</p>
<p>"Sam mentioned a little bit to me while you and Tyler were getting the popcorn and stuff. I asked about the bruises. I know, I'm a bit nosey. Tyler scolds me for it all the time," she said sheepishly. "She said she'd been beaten recently."</p>
<p>"My dad," Brooke sighed, trying not to let the guilty tears win. She still felt incredibly guilty that her father had hurt Sam so badly.</p>
<p>"Yeah, she said something about that. She wasn't too specific though. Just that he went for you and her Mom and she got in the way," Catherine explained. Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"That's one way of putting it," she said sadly.</p>
<p>(Leave it to Sammy to make sure she doesn't seem heroic) she sighed internally.</p>
<p>"Cath, leave poor Brooke alone. It's none of our business," Tyler said softly.</p>
<p>"Sorry," Catherine apologized. Brooke shook her head as Sam shifted to be impossibly closer in Brooke's lap as she slept.</p>
<p>"It's OK. I need to talk to someone. I don't know how to help her. She seems like she's getting so far away from me and I can't hold on tight enough. Her mother says she's not sleeping, she's moody and irritable. And she HATES the motel, according to my aunt who's staying next to them. I wish my father had never found us after we left. Everything was fine then."</p>
<p>"You left?" Tyler asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Brooke quickly explained the situation up to the point they were at now while Tyler and Catherine listened intently. It felt good to talk to someone outside of the situation, especially given that Catherine was a Psych major.</p>
<p>"Sounds like she's lacking in a stable environment," Catherine piped up. "That can cause all sorts of problems on top of what's already bothering her. I'm not trying to diagnose her, Brooke, but she might need professional help." Brooke snorted in a very unladylike fashion.</p>
<p>"No offense, but like I've told you, we've had some bad experiences with therapists. I doubt she'd be all that up for it."</p>
<p>"Well, if you change your mind, or hers, there's a place on Hilltop that I think you'd both like. It's called the St. Franscisan Life Center. It sounds religious, but it's not," Catherine explained. "It's run by nuns who are licensed therapists. It's a very relaxed atmosphere and from what I hear, it seems to work for people who don't like or respond well to conventional treatment."</p>
<p>"I'll think about it," Brooke said as they pulled up in front of a house a few doors down from Catherine's. "Thanks."</p>
<p>"No problem. Let's do this again sometime," Catherine said as Tyler opened her door to let her out. They shared a kiss as Brooke stroked a faded bruise on Sam's cheek with the tip of her finger.</p>
<p>"Oh, my Sammy, let me help you," she whispered to the still sleeping form. She thought it was great that Sam was still asleep but worried that without her there, Sam wouldn't sleep at all. And she HAD to go home or her father would flip.</p>
<p>"Time to go home, Brooke," Tyler whispered. He looked at the two girls in the back seat. "I hope Cath didn't offend you or anything with something she said."</p>
<p>"Nah," Brooke smiled. "She's trying to help and believe me, I appreciate it."</p>
<p>"So, we going to do this again?" Tyler asked with a wide grin. Brooke grinned back.</p>
<p>"Tyler Ross, are you asking me out on a second date?" she asked with a giggle.</p>
<p>"Yes, Brooke. I must say this has been one of the best dates I've had in a while," he joked.</p>
<p>"Me too. Well, in that case, count me in."</p>
