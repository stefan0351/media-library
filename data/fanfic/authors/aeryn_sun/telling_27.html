<!-- Telling Series \ Section 7: Dad - Thunder And Confessions -->

<p>Thunder woke Brooke a week later. She rolled over to grab Sam in comfort but
found the bed beside her empty. Momentary fear that her nightmare of losing Sam
had come true flashed through her at the same time a flash of lightening
illuminated a silhouette in the window. Silently rolling out of bed, Brooke
padded over to the still form in the window and wrapped her arms around Sam from
behind. To her relief, Sam didn't pull away but settled in her arms. </p>
<p>"Not sleeping again?" she asked her insomniac girlfriend. Sam shook her head.
It seemed to Brooke that Sam never slept anymore or when she did she woke in a
cold sweat with a barely contained scream on the tip of her tongue begging to be
released. It broke Brooke's heart and she didn't know what to do to help. She
was getting better but Sam wasn't and Sam wouldn't let her help. </p>
<p>"Go back to sleep, Brooke," Sam said softly. "I was just watching the storm."
Thunder punctuated Sam's words and Brooke couldn't help but think about how the
storm seemed to match what was going on with Sam herself. It wasn't raining yet
but there was thunder and lightening; Sam was calm but Brooke knew inside she
was being torn up by something. Eventually, both storms were going to break and
Brooke could only hope that all floodgates held. </p>
<p>"Talk to me, please, Sammy," Brooke asked gently. She heard Sam sigh. "I'm
losing you and I don't understand why." Sam turned around in Brooke's arms and
looked at her. Another flash of lightening lit up the room and Brooke could see
that Sam had been crying before she had woken up. She reached up and wiped away
the tears and watched as Sam's eyes closed and new tears leaked out. </p>
<p>"How are you losing me?" Sam croaked in confusion. "I don't understand, I'm
right here with you." Her eyes opened again and Brooke could see how lost Sam
was. Brooke felt her own tears beginning to well up. </p>
<p>"You're here but you're pushing me away, you won't let me close to you. Since
you got back, you've taken really good care of me but you won't let me do the
same for you. Look at me, Sam, don't I look better all ready?" Sam nodded. She
had to admit although it had only been a week; Brooke no longer looked like she
was at death's door. </p>
<p>"Dad really screwed us up. You left and I retreated into anorexia Hell, but
after you left, what did you do?" Sam shrugged. "I bet I know. You shut yourself
off so that you couldn't be hurt again. It's what you did after your Dad died.
It took me so long to get through those walls to you. And now you don't know how
to let me close again." Sam tried to push Brooke away but she wasn't able to
escape the cheerleader's grasp. </p>
<p>"See? You're doing it again because you know I'm right." </p>
<p>"Stop it, Brooke," Sam hissed as she struggled in Brooke's arms. But Brooke
was as relentless as the rain that was beginning to pound on the shingled roof.
</p>
<p>"No, you know what else? You haven't called me 'Princess' once since you came
home. That's your special name for me. It made me feel special, like I was
yours. You haven't made love to me since we got here. Don't you feel that way
for me anymore, Sammy? Don't you still love me?" Brooke's voice cracked as she
asked her greatest fear. Sam's eyes got wide in shock and hurt. "Cuz I still
love you despite my father and his insanity. Despite your leaving me," she added
with a whisper and she hung her head. A small sob escaped Sam's lips before she
could stop it. Brooke looked to see Sam shaking her head violently. </p>
<p>"I still love you, oh God help me, I still love you," Sam cried desperately.
"You are my Princess but I can't do this anymore, Brooke, I'm not strong enough.
I don't have the answers I thought I did. I thought going to San Francisco was
the right thing to do and Jesus I nearly killed you!" This time she succeeded in
pulling away from Brooke and backed away like a wounded and frightened animal.
</p>
<p>"I nearly killed you," she repeated in a hiss, her eyes darting around the
room. "Because I thought I was right. I thought I had the answers. My foolish
pride and arrogance almost damned you! I won't let it happen again. I won't let
you close enough for it to happen again. I love you too much. I won't cost you
your Dad, I won't cost my Mom her marriage or Mac her father, and I sure as Hell
won't cost you your life!" Brooke stared at her incredulously. </p>
<p>"That makes absolutely no sense," Brooke said irritated. "You love me too
much to let me get close to you?" Sam nodded. "You stupid ass!" Sam jumped in
surprise. "You didn't have all the answers so you're going to give up on
everything? On me? You were wrong, is that it?" Sam nodded. "Welcome to the
fucking human race, Samantha McPherson! You can't be right all the time, you
stupid ass!" Sam just stared at her in shock and confusion. </p>
<p>"And it wasn't the wrong answer," Brooke continued a little calmer. "You
wanted to give Dad a little space to figure this out. OK, I understand that.
What was wrong was leaving without saying good-bye to me. THAT was wrong." Sam
bowed her head. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry," she choked through her tears. Brooke crossed the space between
them and gathered the crying girl into her arms. </p>
<p>"I know you are but shutting me out now is the wrong answer. I need you now
more than ever. And you need me whether you want to admit it or not," Brooke
told her softly. </p>
<p>"I do need you, so much," Sam admitted as she grabbed the cheerleader in a
desperate embrace. Brooke's heart felt a thousand times lighter at hearing this.
</p>
<p>"Then let me in, Sam. Whether or not Dad learns to accept us, I don't care
anymore all I care about is having you by my side. I love you Samantha
McPherson. And to Hell with everything else." Sam sniffled and looked at her
blonde girlfriend. </p>
<p>"You don't hate me for leaving?" she asked fearfully. Brooke sighed, finally
understanding Sam's behavior. The thought that Brooke must hate her for leaving
like her mother had must have been tearing Sam up inside. Brooke shook her head.
</p>
<p>"Of course not, I just told you that I love you," Brooke reassured her
lovingly. </p>
<p>"I love you too, Princess," Sam breathed with a sigh of relief. Brooke
brushed Sam's hair out of her face and tugged her towards the bed. </p>
<p>"Think maybe you can sleep now?" Sam looked doubtfully at the bed. </p>
<p>"I don't sleep much anymore," she admitted. Brooke cocked her head to the
side in confusion and worry. </p>
<p>"Why?" she asked with a frown. Sam shrugged and looked away. </p>
<p>"I dunno," Sam lied and Brooke saw right though it. </p>
<p>"Liar," Brooke accused. Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"Fine, nightmares. I still have some nightmares, OK, happy?" she asked
angrily. Brooke's frowned deepened. </p>
<p>"Why would I be happy that you're having nightmares?" </p>
<p>"That's not what I meant, Princess. I meant are you happy that I admitted
it?" Sam clarified. </p>
<p>"Oh. In that case, yes. Very. But unhappy that you're having nightmares at
all. Tell you what, you lay down and I'll watch over you in case of nightmares."
Sam rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Oooh, my own living dreamcatcher, huh? Brooke, how about we just go to
sleep?" Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"OK, but if you have a nightmare, you wake me and tell me, OK?" Sam nodded.
</p>
<p>"OK," she relented letting Brooke lead her to the bed and laying down next to
her. She curled up close to Brooke, against her chest, taking the comfort being
offered and let her eyes drift shut despite her fear of her nightmares. Brooke
could feel Sam shaking. </p>
<p>"It's OK, Sam," she whispered. "Sleep." </p>
<p>"I'm scared," Sam admitted. Brooke held her tighter. </p>
<p>"I'm here and I love you, Sammy. Nothing can hurt you," Brooke soothed. She
listened as Sam's breathing became deep and even and she knew the girl had
fallen asleep. It wasn't long after that she too drifted off. </p>
