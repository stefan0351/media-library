<!-- No Regrets \ No Regrets -->

<p>The soft muffled cry of pain woke her like a gunshot next to her ear. Brooke
bolted upright in her chair, instantly ready to do whatever she had to in order
to help the person suffering. She looked over at the prone figure on the bed
for any sign of distress and then sighed. Like it was every time she checked,
Sam hadn't moved. She still lay there, swathed in bandages, unresponsive like
she had since the night of the Junior Prom. The night Nicole had hit her with
her car.</p>
<p>Unbidden, the memories from that night came flooding back to her like an
incoming tide.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;Upset and frightened by things, events and emotions she didn't understand,
Brooke had run out of the building blindly. She'd felt Sam grasp her hand
briefly as she fled. The next thing she truly remembered was the feeling of
being shoved forcefully to the ground as Sam pushed her out of the way of the
speeding Jaguar. </p>
<p>She'd looked up from her vantagepoint on the asphalt at the sound of
squealing tires and the sickening crunch as Sam impacted with the front bumper
of the car. She watched unable to tear her eyes away as Sam slammed into the
hood of the car, letting out a cry of pain that was more of a rush of air as she
did so. As Brooke watched, Sam's then limp body slid up the hood into the
windshield, shattering it upon impact. Sam then tumbled to the cold hard tar
herself, level with Brooke only a few feet away as the car drove out of control
into a fire hydrant further down the road.</p>
<p>Brooke had scrambled over to the unmoving form of her former enemy and now
best friend and.something more? Sam was lying still in a heap partially on her
side, a raspy wheezing sound coming from her. It was the only way that Brooke
knew that she was still alive.</p>
<p>"Oh my God," Brooke cried upon seeing Sam. There was blood everywhere and
Brooke was scared to death. "Sam...Sammy, can you hear me?" At first, there was
no response from her rescuer and Brooke was afraid that she'd slipped away. But
then, Sam's chocolate eyes fluttered a few times and finally focused on the
blonde beside her.</p>
<p>"Br...Brooke?" she gasped. Before Brooke's horrified eyes, a trickle of
blood began to run from Sam's mouth in a steady stream.</p>
<p>"I'm right here, Sammy," Brooke soothed trying to control her tears. She
didn't want to scare Sam with her own panic.</p>
<p>"You OK?" Sam asked, forever concerned about someone else. Brooke managed to
smile slightly despite the gravity of the situation.</p>
<p>"Yes, Sammy, thanks to you. You hold on, you're going to be fine," she knew
she was probably lying but she had to say it anyway. Sam's eyes drifted shut
and Brooke knew she was too weak to open them again.</p>
<p>"OK," Sam said softly. </p>
<p>"Thank you, Sam. You saved my life," Brooke pointed out, trying to keep Sam
awake and aware. She watched a small smirk cross Sam's face.</p>
<p>"You owe me," Sam said with a slight laugh that evolved into a cough. She
then fell silent, softly breathing against Brooke's skin.</p>
<p>"I know. I owe you everything," Brooke whispered to the silent girl. She
kissed Sam on the top of the head. They stayed like that in the middle of the
road with Brooke cradling Sam's injured form until the paramedics arrived. That
was two months ago. And Sam hadn't regained consciousness since.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Another sob of pain broke Brooke from her morbid memories and she again
checked on Sam. Sometimes even in her unconscious state, Sam moaned and cried
out in pain. Her injuries were so severe that the doctors were keeping her in a
medication-induced state of unconsciousness to aid in her healing. But it
wasn't enough to mask the pain she was in. And every whimper and silent tear
that slipped down the inanimate girl's face tore a piece of Brooke's soul apart.</p>
<p>A few tears now slipped down Sam's face as she fought whatever pain or
torment was haunting her dream state and her shoulders shook slightly. Brooke
stroked the brunette's hair gently, speaking softly into her ear as she rested
her head next to Sam's.</p>
<p>"It's OK, Sammy," she soothed. "Nothing can hurt you now. Just rest and
come back to me. Please?" She wasn't at all ashamed to be begging at this
point. The McQueen/McPherson household was strained to its limit with Sam
laying in the hospice, numb to the world. But more than that, Brooke felt this
NEED for Sam that she couldn't quite explain. And she was lost without her.</p>
<p>"Shhh, Sammy, I'm right here," she assured Sam as the girl whimpered again.
Her voice always seemed to have a calming effect on Sam when she got in a bad
way and the doctors encouraged Brooke to talk to her. Eventually, they
reassured the family, they'd slowly ease Sam back into consciousness when her
body was better healed. But they could make no such promises about what her
state of mind would be. She'd taken a hard hit to the head and a blood clot had
formed that the doctors had had to operate to remove. They didn't think there
was brain damage, but wouldn't be sure until she woke up.</p>
<p>"Aw, Sammy, you need to get better and come back because we really need to
talk," Brooke sighed. She seemed to stare into space for a while, gathering her
thoughts and sorting through her memories. She then looked back to Sam's slack
face.</p>
<p>"I don't regret it, Sam. Not a second of it," she whispered softly,
lovingly. She leaned up and kissed the side of Sam's mouth. "I hope you don't."
</p>
<p>Again, her mind drifted to another, happier time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;She was lying in her bed, trying to fall asleep the night before the Prom.
But she couldn't. She was nervous about her `date' with Harrison and Sam.
Harrison was going to give his final decision on who it was between the two
girls that he truly wanted and Brooke was dreading the announcement. </p>
<p>She raised her head slightly when she heard the door to her room creak open.
The faint light from one of the bathroom lamps silhouetted Sam's figure, as she
stood anxiously framed by the door.</p>
<p>"Sam?" Brooke called quietly confused.</p>
<p>"I didn't mean to wake you," Sam whispered hastily. "Go back to sleep, I'll
leave." She spun on her heel to retreat when Brooke's voice stopped her.</p>
<p>"Wait, Sam! I was awake. What is it?" Sam turned around and Brooke could
just barely see in the light that she was biting her bottom lip in nervousness.
It was a cute trait she'd noticed a long time ago about Sam. And then she
berated herself for that thought.</p>
<p>"Come here, sit on the bed and tell me what's on your mind that has you
sneaking into my room at a quarter to three in the morning," she tried to joke
but it came out sounding far too serious. Sam haltingly walked over and sat
down, holding her body stiff and rigid.</p>
<p>"Relax, Sam, I don't bite." This won her a nervous high-pitched laugh.</p>
<p>"That's disappointing to know," Sam joked and blushed scarlet in the faint
light. "Er.sorry," she mumbled afterward. Brooke smiled.</p>
<p>"It's OK," she waved the comment off, ignoring the way her heart fluttered.
"So, what's up?"</p>
<p>"It's...it's about Harrison and tonight." Sam started and stopped. Brooke
flopped back onto her back and let out a huge sigh.</p>
<p>"God, Sam, I don't feel like arguing with you over this. Especially not
right now," she confessed. "This is SO stupid. We're 17 years old and acting
like we're 5 and on the school play ground. Can't we just grow up and ask each
other what we want? I mean, Sam, honestly, do you WANT Harrison? Because if
you do, you know what? It's not worth this petty shit for me to keep fighting
you for him. It's just a tiring waste of time." Sam was quiet for too long
without answering so Brooke figured she'd pissed the brunette off.</p>
<p>"You DO want him, don't you?" she asked angrily. "And it pisses you off that
he MIGHT want me. God, Sam, this is so stupid. I mean."</p>
<p>"I don't want Harrison," Sam interrupted her quietly, staring at her hands.
Brooke stopped and stared at her for a minute. When she didn't continue, Brooke
prompted her.</p>
<p>"Then what do you want, Sam? Do you want Harrison to chose me and get this
over with or do you want him to chose you so that you can finally get one up on
me?" Sam bit her lip again.</p>
<p>"I want...I want...Shit, Brooke, I thought it was obvious," she sighed,
running a frustrated hand through her already disheveled hair. Brooke frowned.</p>
<p>"What's obvious, Sam?" she wondered, sitting up to face Sam as Sam twisted to
look the blonde in the face. Sam's brown eyes were shimmering with unshed tears
as she looked at Brooke in the dark. The pain there surprised the cheerleader.</p>
<p>"That what I want...have wanted for so long...is you," Sam whispered so
softly it was almost lost under the sound of their breathing. Brooke couldn't
stop the gasp that slipped past her lips as tears fell down Sam's face and
splashed onto the bedspread.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Sam croaked. "I shouldn't have said anything. I'll go." she
stood up to flee back to the safety of her own room but Brooke's warm hand
firmly grasping her own prevented her from succeeding. She tugged Sam back down
onto the bed.</p>
<p>"You...you want me?" Brooke asked shocked. Sam bent her head and nodded,
small sobs rocking her frame as she fought to control them. "But I
thought...and Harrison...and...Wow, Sam," she finally managed.</p>
<p>"You're disgusted with me," Sam hiccuped bitterly. Brooke shook her head and
took Sam's chin in her hand, tilting her face up.</p>
<p>"Not at all, Sammy. I'm flattered. And relieved," she confessed. Sam
arched one eyebrow in confusion.</p>
<p>"Relieved? Why? So you can have Harrison?" she asked suspiciously. Brooke
smirked.</p>
<p>"No, not at all. I don't want him either. I'm relieved that my feelings
aren't one-sided," she said simply before pressing her lips to Sam's. They lost
themselves in the feel for several long minutes.</p>
<p>"So does this mean, what I think it means?" Sam panted when they broke
apart. Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes, Sam. I want you too. I care for you more than you know. And if you
wouldn't mind, I'd really like for you to spend the night with me," Brooke said
huskily.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brooke smiled remembering that Sam did indeed stay and the night passed far
too quickly for both of them. And they swore to keep it to themselves for now
and let Harrison down easy at the Prom. But sitting there at the table with
them both caused everything to cave in on Brooke and she panicked. And ran.
And hated herself for it every second since because Sam had suffered for her
cowardice.</p>
<p>She reached out and stroked Sam's still bruised cheek with her fingertips.</p>
<p>"But I don't regret a second," she repeated. And she meant it.</p>
