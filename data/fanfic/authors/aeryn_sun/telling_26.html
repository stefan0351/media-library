<!-- Telling Series \ Section 7: Dad - The Hideaway -->

<p>"Sammy, it's beautiful," Brooke breathed when she got out of the car and
looked around. And it was. Sam had taken them far off the beaten path to a wood
cabin on a crystal clear blue lake far into the woods. All around them were
trees and water and wildlife. No cars, cellphones, traffic or other
distractions. It was life, pure and simple. Sam got out of the car and smiled.
</p>
<p>"Yes, it is. The cabin used to belong to my Dad but Mom and I sold it to a
friend after he died. He's letting me borrow it for a while," she explained as
she got their bags out of the trunk. "The cabin is fully stocked and has all the
amenities of home except a phone or TV. But we do get a radio station and cell
reception out here if we need to call home or they need us." </p>
<p>"And Mom knows we're here?" Brooke asked as she went to help Sam with the
bags. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Yup. I threw the idea at her and she cleared it with Bill, the guy who owns
the cabin now. Anyway, let's get the bags inside and I'll show you around." </p>
<p>They set up their stuff inside and again Brooke was awestruck by the simple
beauty of the cabin. Two stories and made completely out of logs, it had a
kitchen, dining room, a livingroom and bathroom downstairs and three bedrooms
upstairs. There was a screened in porch overlooking the lake downstairs as well
with a perfect view of the sky. </p>
<p>"This was always my favorite room," Sam said as she joined Brooke on the
porch. "I used to grab my sleeping bag and lay out on the floor and stare up at
the stars until I fell asleep." Brooke wrapped her arms around Sam's waist and
was surprised when she felt Sam stiffen slightly. (What is going on with you,
Sammy?) Sam tilted her head to look at her. </p>
<p>"Come on, I'll show you outside." </p>

<p>"We can go swimming, fishing, canoeing, anything you want," Sam continued
their tour with Brooke holding firmly onto her hand. "And about a half mile that
way," she pointed to her right, "is a stream that my Dad used to take me to all
the time. We'd fish and talk, just hang out, you know?" Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Does it look like the place from your coma?" she asked. They both had
stronger memories of that visit now. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"Yes and no. I suppose it does but it was distorted by a child's view, you
know?" </p>
<p>"We'll have to walk over and see what it looks like now," Brooke suggested.
Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"We will when you're a little stronger," she said softly. Brooke pulled away.
</p>
<p>"I'm not made of glass, you know," she said hotly. Sam sighed and looked
away. </p>
<p>"I know, Brooke. But you're not healthy either," she answered quietly. Brooke
felt her anger rise at Sam's subded answer. </p>
<p>"Neither are you!" she screamed at Sam. Sam picked her head up to look at
her. "Or did you think I wouldn't notice? God, Sam, I may have starved my body
but you seemed to have starved your soul! You won't let me near you without
flinching! What's wrong?" She was crying now but Sam just shook her head. </p>
<p>"Nothing," she shrugged. She really didn't want to get into this now. "I just
want you to get well, Brooke." Sam turned to walk back to the cabin but Brooke
reached out and grabbed her arm in a deceptively strong grip. </p>
<p>"Don't turn away from me, Sam! Talk to me, let me in those walls you've built
back up, please," she begged. Sam just blinked at her blankly. "Please don't
close me out, Sammy." Sam reached up and cupped the side of Brooke's face with
her free hand. </p>
<p>"Never. But this is about getting you well again, not me. Besides, I'm fine,"
Brooke opened her mouth to protest but Sam moved her hand to cover it. "Don't. I
said I'm fine, so let it go. Come on, let's go inside and get a bite to eat."
Brooke stayed rooted to the spot. Sam tugged on her arm. </p>
<p>"Please, Brooke, for me?" Brooke glared at her for a few minutes before Sam
gave up with a sigh. "Fine, suit yourself. Stay out here while I cook dinner.
And yes, I did learn to cook while I was away. I promise not to poison you," she
joked weakly. She walked back to the cabin slowly, leaving Brooke on the grass
outside. "I'll call you when it's ready." </p>
<p>Brooke watched her go in silence wondering what exactly was going on. She was
so happy to see Sam again but Sam was so distant, so closed off it was like the
time spent apart had changed her. And that scared Brooke, she wanted her Sammy
to be as before. But she knew the reason they were here was to get back to that
place between them. And one of the ways that she could do that was to eat. Sam
was obviously worried about her and the only way to alieviate that worry was to
eat and get better and as much as the thought of eating repulsed her, she knew
it was the only way through to Sam. So she followed Sam into the cabin a few
minutes later determined to get through to her strangely distant love. </p>
