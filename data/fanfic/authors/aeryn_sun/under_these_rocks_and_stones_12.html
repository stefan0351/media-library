<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ The Bitter Sting of the Truth -->

<p>The sleeping form on the couch hadn't stirred in over an hour but Brooke knew that Sam's pain medication took a lot out of her. She'd spent most of her time in the past week since the accident sleeping and Brooke spent her time standing guard over the girl she loved so desperately. The fact that she could have lost Sam in that accident was crystal clear to her and unbelievably frightening. (Life without Sam? Not possible, it wouldn't be a life, it'd be a half-life. Existing without living) Brooke thought to herself. </p>
<p>The accident had been a real shock to her system. She'd meant what she'd said to Sam in the hospital. Yes, she knew she loved Sam but until faced with the prospect of losing her, Brooke didn't realize how much. And she thought about that argument they had about her fears of being found out, about being `outed'. It seemed so petty now, foolish. How could she want to hide what she and Sam had? It was nothing to be ashamed of, and she wasn't. Sam was right though. She was letting her fear run her life and if Sam had died, no one would have known the truth. Brooke didn't want to live with that. </p>
<p>But she didn't know how tell their parents. Ultimately, telling them that she was gay probably wouldn't be that bad. Both Mike and Jane were understanding people and once the shock wore off they'd most likely accept her. But adding to that that Sam was gay too would knock them off their feet. And the final blow, that they were in love with each other, well, their heads would probably explode. Brooke knew neither would take it well. How could they? This was their family, mixed as it was, and hearing that their two stepdaughters were in love would push anyone to their breaking point. Brooke shuttered to think what their parents would do upon finding out. Whatever it was, it wouldn't be pretty. </p>
<p>Brooke jumped when the doorbell rang but wasn't surprised to find Nicole and Lily standing on the other side. The past week had been hard for them too. Lily's mother Maria was not adjusting well at all to her daughter being gay and in love with the daughter of one of the richest and most prominent families in town. While she hadn't thrown Lily out of the house, she wasn't speaking to her and as far as she was concerned, Lily didn't exist. It was a hard time all around. </p>
<p>"Hey guys," Brooke greeted them tiredly. Nicole and Lily spared her weary smiles. </p>
<p>"Hi B, what's up?" Nic asked as they entered the Palace. She saw Sam asleep on the couch and smiled sympathetically. "How's she doing?" Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"More asleep than awake, unfortunately," Brooke told her, flopping back into her chair at Sam's side. Nicole and Lily sat down across from her. </p>
<p>"She needs the rest, Brooke. She took a hard hit to the head," Lily said. "It'll do her good to just rest." </p>
<p>"I know," Brooke agreed never taking her eyes from Sam. "How are you doing, Lil?" Lily let out a heavy sigh. </p>
<p>"Peachy if you overlook the fact that my mother thinks I'm some sort of twisted, depraved sicko who is a horrible disappointment to her; my arm hurts like hell and I'm probably going to have a scar the size of a jacket zipper across my forehead," she said forlornly. Nicole leaned over and placed a gentle kiss over the bandage still adorning Lily's forehead. </p>
<p>"I still love you," Nicole whispered making Lily smile.</p>
<p>"And that's about all that keeps me going," she admitted. Nicole hugged her knowing that right now Lily needed all the support she could offer. Her mother's reaction had been extremely hurtful to Lily so Nicole was determined to do all she could to make her feel better. Brooke looked up from her Sam study. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry things are going so badly, Lily," she offered. Lily shrugged. </p>
<p>"I am too but I'm glad I don't have to hide anymore. It's frustrating and hurtful and yet freeing," Lily told her. Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"Not that I'd know," she sighed. Nicole and Lily looked at her quizzically. </p>
<p>"Something up, Brooke?" Nic asked. Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"I almost lost her, Nic. And that scared me. We had this stupid argument before the accident about being outed and I told her I wasn't ready for it. I was worried about my image," Brooke explained. Lily winced. </p>
<p>"Ouch, bet Sam didn't take that well," she groaned.</p>
<p>"No, she didn't," Brooke agreed. "I hurt her and didn't mean to. Because I let my fears run my life, like I always do and I'm tired of it." </p>
<p>"Are you going to tell your parents?" Lily asked with a hint of apprehension in her voice. </p>
<p>"I don't know. I think I'll wait until Sam's feeling better first." Sam suddenly shifted on the couch and let out a small whimper. Brooke was by her side in an instant. She gently brushed some hair away from Sam's face and spoke softly to her. </p>
<p>"Easy Sammy, it's OK," she whispered. The frown creasing Sam's forehead faded at the sound of Brooke's voice in her ear. "I'm right here, Sammy." Sam's eyes fluttered open and she smiled upon seeing Brooke. </p>
<p>"Hullo," she said sleepily. Brooke kissed the end of her nose. </p>
<p>"Hey, sleepyhead," Brooke said back. Sam frowned. </p>
<p>"I keep falling asleep on you, I'm sorry." Brooke stroked her cheek lovingly. </p>
<p>"It's OK, Sam, I don't mind. You're going to be OK and that's all I care about. Nic and Lily are here," she said moving slightly so that Sam could see their visitors. </p>
<p>"Hey," Sam said to the other two girls with a small smile. "How goes it?" Nic and Lily smiled back. </p>
<p>"Look, Crash Bandicoot awakens," Nicole joked. Sam gave her a mock glare. </p>
<p>"I suppose you could have done better?" she challenged playfully. Nicole shook her head and laughed. </p>
<p>"From what Lily told me about what actually happened, I doubt it. You're both alive, Sam, you did fine," Nicole said. Sam stared at her surprised. (Did Nicole just give me a semi-compliment? Now I know I'm taking too many meds) Sam thought to herself. Sam yawned. </p>
<p>"Stay with us for a little while, please?" Brooke asked her. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"I'll try," she responded as she fought the urge to crawl back under the blankets and go back to sleep. She hated the way the medication made her feel but she hated the pain from her collarbone, ribs, and head more. She looked at the expression of concern, love and devotion on Brooke's face and it warmed her heart. She knew Brooke loved her deeply and it made her feel whole. </p>
<p>"How's your Mom?" Sam asked Lily. Lily sighed and frowned. </p>
<p>"Still freaking out, unfortunately. I think it's going to take a long time for her to come to terms with the whole thing," Lily told her. Sam nodded sadly. </p>
<p>"I can only imagine how freaked our parents are going to be," she said more to herself than anyone else. Brooke gently nudged her to move over and climbed up next to her on the couch, letting Sam lay against her.</p>
<p>"We have to tell them. Soon, I think," Brooke said as she ran her hands through Sam's hair. Sam sighed and relaxed against her. </p>
<p>"I know," she said. "But I think I've taken all the abuse I can stand for the time being." </p>
<p>"I know Sam, but the time is coming. I don't want to hide anymore," Brooke told her. Sam shifted slightly and gave her a bright smile. </p>
<p>"Me either, love, me either." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Mom, Dad, Sam and I need to talk to you, it's important," Brooke said with more confidence than she felt a week later. Mike and Jane exchanged confused glances but followed Sam and Brooke into the living room. </p>
<p>"OK, what's on your minds, girls?" Jane asked after sitting down. Sam and Brooke looked at each other both at a loss as to what to say next. Despite rehearsing the scenario several times in the past week, now faced with the actual situation, nothing seemed right. Sam bit her bottom lip and shrugged at Brooke. She was lost. Brooke sighed at her. </p>
<p>"Well, you know that despite the childish things we may have done in the past, Sam and I would never do anything to intentionally hurt you, right?" Brooke asked to start with. Mike and Jane nodded. </p>
<p>"Of course, honey. You've both grown up a lot," Mike said. </p>
<p>"Thanks, Dad," Brooke said. "And all the two of you really want for either of us is for us to be happy right?" Again Jane and Mike nodded. </p>
<p>"Yes," Jane answered. "Where are you going with this Brooke?" </p>
<p>"Mom, what if," Sam spoke up, "what if what made us happy was something that wasn't what you expected? What if it was something that bothered you?" Worry and alarm crept onto Jane's face. </p>
<p>"Exactly what are you getting at, Sam?" Jane asked her daughter. Brooke and Sam exchanged one last glance before saying the words. They nodded at each other in silent communication. There was no backing out now. </p>
<p>"Mom, I'm gay," Sam said, jumping first. Jane gasped and Mike blinked in surprise. Sam felt a sudden wave of dizziness and nausea pass over her. </p>
<p>"So am I," Brooke chimed in, joining Sam in the freefall. Mike's eyes narrowed. </p>
<p>"That's not funny, Brooke," he said flatly. Brooke returned the glare. </p>
<p>"Good because I wasn't kidding," she responded in the same tone. "But that's not what we're trying to tell you. Yes, we're both gay but there's more." </p>
<p>"Oh Jesus," Jane groaned putting her head in her hands. Sam looked at Brooke pitifully. </p>
<p>"Mom, Dad, Sam and I are in love. With each other," Brooke finally said outloud. Sam sat down heavily as the wave of dizziness overwhelmed her. She thought she was going to pass out. Brooke was right by her side concerned. </p>
<p>"You OK?" Brooke asked her. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Yeah, saying it outloud was kinda shocking is all," she whispered. She looked at their parents who were sitting there in shock. "This is going to be bad," she warned. Brooke glanced over at Mike and Jane. </p>
<p>"I know," she agreed. "But we're in this together," she reminded Sam who spared her a small smile. </p>
<p>"This is absolutely unacceptable!" Jane suddenly yelled startling both girls. "Sam, you can't make a decision like this, you don't have enough experience with guys to know whether or not you like them." Sam stood up and faced her mother. </p>
<p>"Excuse me?" Sam responded to the absurdity of the statement. "I wasn't slutty enough so I can't be gay? Get a grip, Mom. I know my heart and what it tells me. It tells me that I love Brooke!" </p>
<p>"No, you don't!" Mike broke in. "And she doesn't love you. It's a phase every teen goes through. Besides, you're both too young to understand what love is." </p>
<p>"How dare you presume to speak for me!" Brooke screamed at her father. "I love her and nothing you say or do is going to change that. This isn't a phase or an experiment. This is genuine and real and we are both aware of what love is. This is love, what we feel for one another, that is what love is." </p>
<p>"No it isn't. I refuse to accept this," Jane stated emphatically. Sam glared at her mother. </p>
<p>"Tough. Besides, it isn't for you to accept. I've accepted it. I did a long time ago, actually. You can catch up at your own pace. Or not, I honestly don't care," she hissed. "We were just trying to be honest."</p>
<p>"Well, we're putting a stop to whatever the two of you think you have right here, right now," Mike announced. Brooke and Sam stared at him. </p>
<p>"Excuse you? Just who the Hell do you think you are?" Brooke asked indignantly. </p>
<p>"Your parents," Mike answered angrily. "And this is still my house and as long as you live here this sort of behavior will not be tolerated." Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"I was so hoping you wouldn't stoop to that," she sighed. "Look, screaming about this isn't going to get us anywhere. Can't we sit and talk about this?" </p>
<p>"I don't want to deal with this right now," Jane said upset as she exited the room. </p>
<p>"Mom!" Sam called after her, hurt evident in her voice. She looked at Brooke and shook her head as tears began to flow. </p>
<p>"And you Dad?" Brooke asked. </p>
<p>"I've made myself clear. If you want to stay living here, you stop this game the two of you are playing right now," he growled. </p>
<p>"Oh for God's sake," Brooke sighed. "Who are you because you sure aren't my Dad." </p>
<p>"You are NOT gay," he spat at her as if that was enough to change her mind. "Sam maybe I can see, but not my own daughter." </p>
<p>"Not in MY house, huh, Dad? Not in MY family?" Brooke mocked her father making him angrier. "I've got news for you; your teenage, cheerleadering, straight A, homecoming queen daughter is a card carrying, certified lesbian who is deeply in love with her stepsister. Fodder for Jerry Springer? Yes, but I don't care. And you know something else? I'm still the same little girl you raised and had breakfast with this morning. Nothing's changed." Mike shook his head. </p>
<p>"That's where you're wrong," he said lowly. "Everything's changed and if you keep this up you can get the Hell out of my house," he added before storming out of the room and leaving Sam and Brooke in his wake.</p>
<p>"Well, that sucked," Sam said between sniffles. Brooke walked over and hugged her gently, careful of her broken collarbone. </p>
<p>"Our happy little nuclear family just imploded," Brooke observed dryly. She was too upset to cry just yet. Upset and angry, actually. Both parents had bounced off the walls like superballs and it was somewhat unexpected. She had thought at least one would act civilized. (Hoping too much, I guess) she thought to herself. </p>
<p>"What do we do now?" Sam asked. Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"I don't want to stop our relationship. I love you too much to do that, so I guess we pack up and start looking for somewhere to stay," she said sadly. "And hope they come to their senses soon." Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"We'd better go pack. And call Nic and Lily, too. They'll want to know what's going on." </p>
<p>"Yeah. Know any good hotels?" </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Well, I know four parents not getting nominated for Parent of the Year," Nicole said coldly from the couch in Sam and Brooke's hotel room. Thanks to the Julian name, the two girls had a very plush place to stay as long as they needed it which they all hoped wasn't long. Nicole had called in some family favors to get the room and Sam and Brooke were very grateful. Of course, they figured their parents would spontaneously combust if they knew they were staying in the Honeymoon Suite together. </p>
<p>"Ain't that the truth," Sam snickered. She and Brooke had all they needed for an extended stay and had left in the middle of the night with nothing more than a short note to their parents telling them what hotel they were in and hoping that they could work through this soon. It was scary being out on their own like this but if it was how their parents wanted to play it, they had no choice. The other option wasn't viable. </p>
<p>"Man, did things get out of hand or what?" Lily asked from the table nearby. She hated seeing Sam and Brooke so torn up and things with her own mother as well as Nic's weren't getting any better. </p>
<p>"Unfortunately," Brooke agreed. "Four homosexual girls and four homophobic parents. Has a sad symmetry to it." </p>
<p>"I'd prefer it crooked," Sam said dryly. "I would have liked at least ONE of our parents to have looked at us and said `Are you happy? Because that's all I care about'. You know, the important stuff." </p>
<p>"Well, at least the truth's out now, Sam. What they chose to do with it is up to them, now. We don't have to hide or sneak around anymore," Brooke said. Sam shot her a look. </p>
<p>"What about school?" the question was directed at all of them. "Are any of us ready to `out' ourselves to the populace of Kennedy High?" No one answered her. "Yeah, didn't think so. Our parents might know, but the four of us are still very much in the closet." </p>
<p>"Are you ready to smack people in the face with the closet door, Spam?" Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, I was just seeing if anyone else was, Satan." </p>
<p>"Knock it off, you two," Brooke snapped. She really didn't want to listen to Sam and Nicole get into it right now. </p>
<p>"Brooke, I'm just saying, yes, be proud that we told our parents but don't get ahead of yourself. We're still closeted and probably will be for a while," Sam explained. </p>
<p>"I get it," Brooke sighed. "Do you think Mom and Dad are going to come around anytime soon?" </p>
<p>"Can't say. Wasn't really expecting the total flip out that we experienced to begin with so I'm at a loss," Sam admitted. She really had expected her mother to take the news better. She wasn't sure what bothered her mother more; the fact that she was gay or that she loved Brooke. </p>
<p>"Well," Lily said in resignation. "All we can do now is wait. For all our parents to wake up and get a clue." </p>
<p>"I wonder if we can get a group rate on family therapy?" Nicole wondered outloud.</p>
