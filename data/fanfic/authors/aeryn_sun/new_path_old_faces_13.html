<!-- New Path, Old Faces \ Graduation -->

<p>Graduation day arrived and Brooke was desperately trying to
put the finishing touches on her speech. It wasn't what she wanted but it was
going to have to do. Sam was walking around the house with Mac on her hip trying
to get ready. </p>
<p>"You're not helping, Mac," she scolded as Mac pulled her hair
down just as fast as she managed to put it up. Mac seemed to love Sam's hair as
much as Brooke did, albeit for different reasons. Brooke giggled. Sam was fast
overcoming her nervousness around babies. Of course, given Mac's attachment to
her she didn't have much of a choice. </p>
<p>"How's it coming Princess?" she asked as she wrestled her hair
away from Mac and set the baby down on the dresser. Mac picked up the nearby
stuffed turtle and kept herself occupied as Sam worked on her hair. Brooke
sighed with frustration. </p>
<p>"It's done. It sucks, but it's done," Brooke answered her. Sam
smiled. </p>
<p>"I'm sure it doesn't suck, love. And even if it does no one's
really going to be listening anyway," Sam joked. Brooke threw a pillow at her. </p>
<p>"Thanks, you're a lot of help," Brooke chided. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"I offered to help but you turned me down. Live with the
consequences," she told Brooke. Brooke stuck out her tongue. "Don't tease, love.
We haven't the time," she laughed. Brooke walked over and helped Sam finish her
hair as Mac watched. </p>
<p>"You look great," Brooke whispered as she placed a kiss to the
back of Sam's neck. Sam blushed. </p>
<p>"So do you," Sam whispered back. Brooke picked Mac up who
cooed at her happily. </p>
<p>"We look fabulous, don't we Mac? The gorgeous
McPherson-McQueen's, huh?" Brooke asked Mac as she swung the baby around.
</p>
<p>"We need to get going," Sam reminded her. Brooke nodded and
headed towards the stairs. </p>
<p>"Let's give the baby to the `rentals and get to the school. We
only get one shot at this, let's not screw it up." </p>

<p>Sam fidgeted in her seat as Brooke walked up to the podium.
She was nervous for her and could only imagine how Brooke felt. She twisted in
her seat until she saw their parents who smiled at her. Then Sam saw Kelly who
glared murderously at her. (Oh, another country heard from) Sam thought dryly.
Sam glared back at her refusing to be intimidated by the woman. She turned her
attention back to Brooke as Brooke cleared her throat and began to speak.
</p>
<p>"Hello everyone, Class of 2002 and our parents. My name is
Brooke McQueen but I think you all knew that," she said with a nervous laugh.
"Well, we've reached the end of this road, guys. Our high school careers are
over and whether or not we continue to pursue academic achievements is a
personal decision. So this is our good-bye." </p>
<p>"I've been trying for a while to figure out exactly what I
wanted to say when I got up here and I'll be honest and tell you I still haven't
figured it out. What I do know is that the road from kindergarten to here hasn't
always been an easy one. We've gained friends and lost others, nothing has
remained the same. The only thing that has remained the same is the fact that we
are not the same people we once were." </p>
<p>"We have changed, but so has the world we live in. The world
is changing around us and it is our challenge as we enter the world as adults to
meet those changes and find a way to better them. We are the next generation and
the world is ours. It is our challenge, our duty to enter the world and find a
way to make it better, not worse. I know most of you sitting out there and I
think that if there's any group of individuals who can change the world, it's
the 2002 graduating class of Kennedy High. Thank you." </p>
<p>Everyone applauded and stood up as Brooke left the stage and
returned to her seat next to Sam (gotta love alphabetical order). She blushed
and tried to hide her face as she finally reached Sam. </p>
<p>"God, I am so glad that's over," she said to Sam who hugged
her. </p>
<p>"I don't know what you were worried about, Princess. That
didn't suck," Sam assured her. Brooke smiled a bit and giggled. </p>
<p>"Thanks but, that's not what I wrote," she confessed. Sam's
eyes got wide. </p>
<p>"Excuse me?" </p>
<p>"I just kind of `winged it' once I got up there," Brooke
explained. Sam shook her head and laughed. </p>
<p>"I'm impressed. You'd never know." Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"Let's hope no one else noticed." </p>

<p>"So what are you two doing this summer?" Lily asked after
graduation as the two mixed gangs gathered at the Palace for a party. Brooke and
Sam were standing together in the kitchen. </p>
<p>"We don't know yet," Brooke admitted. "Just hang out I guess.
Maybe go on a few trips. You?" Lily sighed. </p>
<p>"Working and then off to college. Such is the married life.
You two starting in the fall?" Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"We've both decided to defer a year and just take a breather,"
Sam explained. "We've been through a lot in the past year and think starting
college right off might be overload." Lily nodded. </p>
<p>"I understand. You've made some good points. A year off to
relax will probably do you both some good," she agreed. Sam enveloped Brooke in
a hug and sighed. </p>
<p>"We can only hope," she said quietly. </p>
<p>"And sometimes that's all you can do," Lily told her while she
patted both girls. It was true, they'd both been through a lot since Nicole's
drunken driving spree. Time off together without school pressures or anything
else was just what the doctor ordered for them to fully recover. </p>
