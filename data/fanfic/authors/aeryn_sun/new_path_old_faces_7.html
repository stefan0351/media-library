<!-- New Path, Old Faces \ Winding Down -->

<p>"I am so glad to be out of those shoes," Brooke moaned as she
flopped down on the couch at the beach house next to Sam and started to massage
her feet. Sam grabbed Brooke's feet and took over that duty. </p>
<p>"Oh, Sammy, that feels nice," she gasped. </p>
<p>"Hey, hey, none of that in the house," Carmen complained as
she walked into the room with one hand over her eyes. Sam stuck out her tongue. </p>
<p>"I'm massaging her feet you perv," Sam informed her haughtily
as Brooke snickered. Carmen laughed and sat down in the armchair nearby.
</p>
<p>"I know. Did you see the look on Lily's face when they called
her name for Prom Queen? I thought her brain exploded," Carmen joked. Sam and
Brooke laughed. </p>
<p>"Or imploded," Brooke countered. "But it was nice for her." </p>
<p>"Yes it was Brooke, thank you," Lily said as she walked in the
room and hugged Brooke from behind. </p>
<p>"You are very welcome, Lily. But I didn't technically do
anything." </p>
<p>"You weren't bitter or upset. Instead you let me enjoy the
moment, even if Nicole did make a scene. Actually it was worth it just to watch
that," Lily explained. </p>
<p>"That was pretty funny," Sam added, recalling how Nicole had
ranted and raved on stage, arms flailing about and face red. She took lots of
pictures of that. </p>
<p>"She'll get over it," Brooke said calmly. "So what are we
going to do now?" </p>
<p>"Well, we have three glorious days to ourselves in this house
to do whatever we want," Nicole explained as she came down the stairs and caught
the end of the conversation. "We do what we want. We have a fully stocked
fridge, endless DVDs, the beach and ocean at our disposal so, enjoy."

<p>And enjoy they did. The weekend passed way too fast for both
Sam and Brooke's liking. They spent every moment together either on the beach or
cuddled on the couch watching movies. They kind of annoyed the others with their
constant cuteness but no one really held it against them and Josh and Lily were
almost as bad. </p>
<p>With prom over, attention shifted to graduation and passing
those last classes. Brooke fretted over where in the class she was ranked and
what colleges would accept her while Sam just went with the flow, happy to pass
her classes and get into college. Brooke soon realized there was an issue they
hadn't discussed. </p>
<p>"Sammy, we never talked about what we were going to do about
college," she said quietly one evening while they were lying in bed together.
Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"I know. I've been thinking about it lately. What are we going
to do?" </p>
<p>"Where do you want to go?" Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"U of Southern Cal has a nice journalism program," she said.
Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"I applied there. I can go there." Sam shook her head.
</p>
<p>"It doesn't work that way, love. What do you want to study?"
Brooke was quiet for a few minutes. "Brooke?" </p>
<p>"That's just it, Sam. For the first time, I really don't know
what I'm going to do next," she said softly. Sam snuggled closer. </p>
<p>"That's OK, Brooke. You'll figure it out. But you can't base
your college decision on where I'm going." </p>
<p>"I know. I just want to stay close to you," Brooke explained. </p>
<p>"And I want you to. But make up your own mind, Princess. Well
work it out from there on, OK?" Brooke smiled. </p>
<p>"OK, Sammy. But U. of Southern Cal is a possiblity," she said. </p>
<p>"You're right, it is, but only if it has something you're
interested in studying there. Otherwise you'll find another school, only one
close," Sam told her. </p>
<p>"Deal," Brooke agreed. </p>
