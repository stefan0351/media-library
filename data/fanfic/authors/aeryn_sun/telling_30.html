<!-- Telling Series \ Section 7: Dad - Reality Bites. So Bite Back -->

<p>"We have to go home soon, you know," Sam lamented as she chewed on a blade of
grass and stared up at the dimming sky. Brooke lifted her head from where it had
been resting on Sam's shoulder and frowned. </p>
<p>"You sure know how to kill a Kodak moment," she complained before putting her
head back down. Sam stroked the blonde's hair gently. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry, it's just we can't stay here forever. As much as I wish we could,
we can't. Reality awaits our return," Sam pointed out. Brooke sighed and buried
her face in Sam's shoulder. </p>
<p>"I prefer this reality. You and me and this place. This is us, our place now,
Sammy," she said happily. Sam giggled. </p>
<p>"As much as I love being here with you and making love to you out here, I
think eventually other hikers might stumble upon us and that would be, oh,
what's the word.embarrassing?" Brooke laughed at what the look on said hikers
faces might be. </p>
<p>"So?" she challenged. "Let's buy the cabin from Bill and move out here and
never deal with my dad again," she suggested. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Again, tempting. But I think we've learned that running away is the wrong
answer. Besides, I think we run the risk of becoming little female versions of
the Unibomber or something if we do that. Not healthy. Besides, we're not the
ones with the problem. Mike and Harrison and Carmen are. If they can't deal, let
them leave, I'm through running." Brooke looked up into Sam's face and saw that
she meant it. </p>
<p>"Seriously?" she asked, just to be sure. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Yes, as long as I have you, Princess, nothing else matters. Everyone and
everything can go to Hell in a handbasket for all I care. Just be mine, Brooke,
that's all I ask," Sam said her eyes open and vulnerable. Brooke blinked away
the sudden tears that welled up at Sam's words. </p>
<p>"Forever, Sammy, without question," she vowed. Sam shifted so she could look
Brooke in the eye but so that Brooke was still leaning on her. A little
uncomfortable, but who cares? </p>
<p>"Forever yours, Princess," she said earnestly. "Whether or not anyone accepts
us. We'll simply move around until we find somewhere that does." Brooke's eyes
lit up. </p>
<p>"You mean it?" </p>
<p>"Of course, I would never lie to you when it's this important, love," Sam
smiled. Brooke's brow furrowed. </p>
<p>"Uhm, when would you lie to me?" she asked. (Saw that one coming) Sam laughed
to herself. </p>
<p>"I wouldn't," she half-lied. Brooke frowned at her. </p>
<p>"That, that was a lie," Brooke challenged playfully. Sam rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"OK, you know that pink and blue shirt you had?" Brooke nodded. "I'm the one
that shrunk it in the wash, not Mom. OK? That was a lie." Brooke reached out and
smacked her. </p>
<p>"I liked that shirt," she complained. </p>
<p>"Hey, I liked you in that shirt. It accentuated all the right things," Sam
answered winning herself another swat. "Sorry, geez, that was a compliment,
y'know." Brooke smiled and leaned in to lick at Sam's neck. Sam sighed happily.
</p>
<p>"Don't so that, we have to head back to the cabin before it gets too dark,"
Sam warned breathlessly. </p>
<p>"What's the matter, Sammy? `Fraid of getting lost?" Brooke asked huskily as
she continued, moving lower. Sam moaned. </p>
<p>"I'm not the one who's going to be complaining when it's too dark to see
where we're going and we hear something behind us," Sam pointed out although she
really was past the point of caring. She felt Brooke smile against her skin. </p>
<p>"Don't worry, I have my Big Bad Sammy to protect me," Brooke purred. </p>
<p>"Uh-huh, remember that when we're being eaten by wolves," Sam whispered. </p>
<p>"The only wolf I'm interested in's name is Sam." </p>
