<!-- High School Hell \ Fixing The Broken Wheel -->

<p>Nicole sat numbly in the lobby waiting for her driver to come and pick her up, mulling over the words Sam had told her. She was very close to being physically ill. The person lying in that hospital bed up there was not Sam McPherson. Sure her chart might say that was her name and she might look like Sam but that wasn't her. That was a shell, a mocking parody of the Sam whom Nicole had known. And Nicole wasn't sure exactly what had done that, Pierce or the tiny tape recorder she was presently turning over in her hands. She had gotten Sam to give it to her so she could give it to Brooke. Brooke needed to hear what was on that tape. Maybe then they could figure out what to do next.</p>
<p>But the conversation after Sam confessed she didn't want Brooke back was what was turning Nicole's stomach. The girl had no fight left and it scared Nicole to see the normally spirited Sam so defeated and broken.</p>
<p>"Because I don't want her back." Sam had delared solemnly. Nicole stared at her in shock. </p>
<p>"Why the Hell not? She loves you desperately! You're killing her!" Sam looked away in hurt and shame. She then shrugged. </p>
<p>"She'll live," Sam sighed. "Everyone will make sure of that this time." Sam's voice had taken on a monotone quality that Nicole really didn't like. It sent chills up her spine. </p>
<p>"What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?" Nicole demanded to know. Sam focused her eyes on Nic and Nic saw the emptiness there.</p>
<p>"I can't do this again, Nic. But I have to if I want to walk again. But she doesn't have to and I'm not going to make her," Sam explained flatly. Nicole shook her head. </p>
<p>"That's not your decision to make, Sam, it's hers. Brooke wants to be there for you because she loves you." It was Sam's turn to shake her head. </p>
<p>"I know," Sam said softly. "But it's not enough anymore."</p>
<p>"Don't you love her anymore? You must know that tape was a phony." </p>
<p>"I love her unequivocally, without question, completely and with every bit of my heart and soul, even if she meant every word on that tape."</p>
<p>"Then I don't understand this," Nicole said confused.</p>
<p>"Have you ever loved something so much that you were willing to let it go because you knew that you'd end up causing it more harm than good?" Sam asked sadly. </p>
<p>(Yeah, you) Nicole thought ruefully but only nodded. Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"It's like this: I'm going to walk again, but I've got to do the therapy thing first. I don't want Brooke to waste her time with that. But that's only one part of why I'm pushing her away. Look at what's happening here, Nic. I was physically attacked because of my relationship with Brooke and she's been partially shunned at school. I know that hurts her, her popularity is important to her." </p>
<p>"She's still Queen of Kennedy," Nicole pointed out.</p>
<p>"But falling fast with people like Becky Wright eager to knock her from her throne. I'm not going to be the reason she loses everything."</p>
<p>"I thought you didn't care about those things," Nic said arrogantly. Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"I don't, Brooke does. I've hit the wall, Nic. I've taken all I can take and I'm walking away, if you'll excuse the expression, before we get in any deeper." </p>
<p>"Jesus, Sam, you can't just turn your back on her like this," Nic argued. Sam scowled. </p>
<p>"Watch me. Now if you don't mind, I'd like to be alone."</p>
<p>So now Nicole sat wondering what to do next. Yes, she had to tell Brooke what was behind Sam's horrid behavior but beyond that, she had no clue. She saw the car pull up. (OK, off to Brooke's where I can fix at least part of this. Beyond that, I hope the answers come to me before Sam is too far gone) But part of her feared it was all ready too late. </p>

<p>"So she knew that tape was a phony?" Brooke asked between hiccups. Her tears had finally settled down to the occasional hiccup now that she knew the reason behind Sam's behavior. Nic had given her the tape to listen to and after being physically ill for several minutes, she now lay on her back on her bed trying to figure out what to do next. </p>
<p>"I'm pretty sure, yeah," Nic said from where she sat on the floor. "Where did the tape come from, Brooke?" Brooke thought a minute.</p>
<p>"Some of it sounds like a conversation I had with Becky Wright a few days ago," she said starting to get angry. "But WAY out of context." Nic nodded. </p>
<p>"Figured as much," she sighed. "Becky must have taped the conversation and altered what you said to make that abomination and sent it to Sam. But why?" </p>
<p>"Well, we know that Pierce attacked Sam because he liked me and he thinks gay people are evil," Brooke thought outloud. </p>
<p>"But why didn't he go after you too, aside from the fact that he liked you?" Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"Maybe Sam was closer?" </p>
<p>"Or maybe he figured Sam `converted' you or something since you used to date guys," suggested Lily from the chair a few feet away where she'd been sitting quietly until now. Nic and Brooke nodded in agreement. </p>
<p>"Makes a warped kind of sense," Nic agreed. "He might see Sam as the true source of the evil and you as the innocent victim," she said to Brooke. Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"But what about Becky?" she asked. </p>
<p>"Maybe she was jealous of Pierce's crush on you and wanted you to lose Sam like she lost him," Lily said. "And she figured the best way to do that was to make Sam hate you." Nic looked at Lily. </p>
<p>"When did you get so insightful?" she asked lightly. Lily smiled. </p>
<p>"When I got married," she retorted. "Anyway, what do we do now?" Nic and Brooke shook their heads. </p>
<p>"I don't know but Brooke, you have to do something about Sam," Nicole warned. Brooke sat up on the bed alarmed. </p>
<p>"What? Why? What about her?" Nicole looked at her solemnly.</p>
<p>"I've never seen her like that, Brooke," she whispered. Brooke's eyes got wider as her alarm grew into fear. </p>
<p>"Like what, Nic? Come on, you're scaring me." </p>
<p>"Defeated, broken, Brooke. She has no spirit left, hon. And it was horrible to look at. There's no light in her eyes, no energy around her and her voice sent chills down my spine," Nic told her. Brooke sprang up from the bed. </p>
<p>"Oh Jesus," she swore. "She's doing it again."</p>
<p>"Doing what?" Lily asked. Brooke shook her head as she pulled on her shoes. </p>
<p>"Shutting down, turning off her emotions so that she can't be hurt. She did it last time when Dad reacted so badly to the news about the two of us and I nearly lost her then. She builds walls around herself and I have to stop her before it's too late." </p>
<p>"You going to the hospital?" Nic asked. Brooke nodded. "OK, just, I want you to know one thing, Brooke. Her eyes." Brooke frowned and looked at Nicole. </p>
<p>"What about them?" </p>
<p>"They're empty, Brooke. Completely empty." </p>
