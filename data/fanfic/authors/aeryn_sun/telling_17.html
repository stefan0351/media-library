<!-- Telling Series \ Section 6: Mary Cherry - People In Glass Houses...Break A Lot Of Windows -->

<p>"It's wrong and amoral and depraved and morally wrong and reprehensible..."
Mary Cherry continued fifteen minutes later as she paced and Brooke and Sam sat
on the couch in the Novak watching. </p>
<p>"I think she just used her allowance of big words for the year," Sam yawned.
Brooke leaned her head on Sam's shoulder and sighed. (If she's reacting this
badly to us, her head'll explode if she ever found out about Nic) </p>
<p>"Let her get it out of her system now and maybe she won't do something
outrageous with it later," she suggested. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Let's hope so," Sam agreed. </p>
<p>You know, I think we would have been better off gathering everyone into a
room and telling them all at once rather than one at a time," Brooke said in
hindsight. "At least we'd be done by now." Sam smirked. </p>
<p>"True. We could have dropped the bomb and ran and let them all fight it out
amongst themselves. Can you see it? Carmen, Mary Cherry and Harrison vs. Lily,
Josh, Nicole, and Sugar? Man, I'd pay to see that Royal Rumble," Sam laughed.
Brooke giggled at the imagery. </p>
<p>"We could charge on Pay-per-View," Brooke joked. Sam looked down at Brooke
with a shocked look on her face. </p>
<p>"Careful, I think my sense of humor is wearing off on you," she warned.
Brooke looked suitably frightened. </p>
<p>"We're in trouble if that ever happens," she agreed. Mary Cherry suddenly
turned and approached Brooke with an angry (angrier?) look on her face. </p>
<p>"Do y'all have any idear what this is gonna do ta all the lil' Brookie
worshippies out thar? They'll all either convert ta gayism er decide that y'all
ain't cool no more an' then we'll all be unpopular like Spammie McPride over
thar," she declared. Sam swallowed the anger that was starting to bubble from
the stupid names Mary Cherry was calling her. (I will not stoop to her level, I
won't) Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"Her name is Sam McPherson, Mary Cherry. Either call her Sam or don't say her
name at all," obviously Brooke was bothered by it too. Mary Cherry glared at
her. </p>
<p>"Whatever. Are ya listening ta me at all, Brookie? Y'all are gonna destroy us
all," Mary Cherry pointed out. It was like a distorted echo of Carmen's
sentiments a few days earlier. (Very distorted, Funhouse distorted, echo) Brooke
put her face in her hands and softly started to cry, more out of frustration
than anything else. Sam rubbed her back for a minute and then let her anger get
the better of her and stood up to face the still irate Texan. </p>
<p>"All right, my turn you ignorant, Bible-thumping, axe-murdering, anal
retentive little twit!" she exploded, surprising even herself with the force
behind her voice. Brooke looked up to watch, not about to miss this show. </p>
<p>"First off, what Brooke and I have is no one's business but our own. It's
pure and good and real and not in anyway, shape or form evil. It is love, pure
and simple and God would not create a love that is wrong. Got that? Good,
because I'm not repeating it. Let me know if I'm going too fast for you at
anytime Mary Cherry and I'll slow down or draw pictures for you." Mary Cherry
nodded mutely, suddenly very very afraid. Sam took a few more steps towards her
until she had Mary Cherry backed up against the sink. Brooke watched with a half
smirk on her face. She loved it when Sam got wound up like this. For a couple of
reasons. First off, winding down was...fun. </p>
<p>"Second, we're only telling you and everyone else because you're our friends
although with you I use that term very loosely. Thirdly, neither of us gives a
shit what anyone thinks anymore, least of all a narrowminded little idiot like
you. If you have a problem with this, look away or go join Harrison and Carmen
at the reject homophobic table they currently reside at because we won't miss
your 'sparkling' company." </p>
<p>"Finally, and this is my favorite, who the Hell are you to accuse us of being
evil or wrong? Jesus, Mary Cherry, you're so inbred you were born with webbed
toes and feet for God's sake. Now if any love was wrong or evil, that was. Now
that, that is incest. And as far as us being gay and that being wrong, have you
talked to your father lately? If not I think you might want to have a LONG talk
with him cuz there's a little tidbit of info I think you might have overlooked
concerning him." Mary Cherry was blinking at her in shock and Brooke was trying,
rather unsuccessfully, to smother a giggle with the back of her hand. Sam put
her hands on her hips. </p>
<p>"Now," she started in a much calmer voice, "did you get all that?" Mary
Cherry nodded. "Good, now, either get your head out of your ass and congratulate
us on being happy or shut your oversized fly trap and get out of our sight." </p>
<p>It took Mary Cherry a few minutes to formulate an answer, she was staring at
Sam with her mouth wide open, speechless. While she waited, Sam went and sat
back down next to Brooke. Brooke wrapped her arms around Sam and hugged her
tightly. </p>
<p>"That was very sexy," Brooke purred into her ear, not caring that Mary Cherry
was still standing at the sink letting Sam's words sink in. Sam gave her a sexy
smile. </p>
<p>"Liked my little rant, did ya?" Sam asked as she kissed Brooke's forehead,
also ignoring Mary Cherry's existence. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"It was very...impassioned," Brooke whispered, leaning closer to Sam's face
and staring at Sam's lips. She watched the corners of Sam's mouth quirk up. </p>
<p>"I do impassioned very well, don't you think?" Sam teased while running her
tongue over her bottom lip. Brooke nodded, unable to think or form a response
for the blood roaring in her ears. She closed the gap between them and kissed
Sam for all she was worth and only broke apart when Mary Cherry decided to make
her presence known again. </p>
<p>"Geez, y'all get a room. Don't make me hose ya down." </p>
