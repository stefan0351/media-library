<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Message in a Bottle -->

<p>The next morning came and found Sam shifting nervously from
foot to foot. She hadn't slept well, tossing and turning all night lost in
nightmares about Mike finding them. She wasn't really afraid of any physical
violence that he might do. He wasn't that type of guy. But she was worried about
the emotional and mental harm he could do to Brooke. As strong and supportive as
the blonde was, Brooke was still somewhat emotionally fragile where her father
was concerned and Sam didn't want to see Mike hurt her anymore. </p>
<p>Second only to that was her fear of being separated from
Brooke. Sure once they were 18 they could do what they wanted but the time until
then would be horrible. Not to mention the whole concept struck her as unfair
and over-the-top. Was the man iving in another century to honestly believe that
`out of sight' really equalled `out of mind'? Because it didn't matter to Sam
how much space or time was between them, she was never going to stop loving
Brooke. </p>
<p>She was still shuffling anxiously as Terri dialed the familiar
number to Jane's work. They'd decided to call her there rather the Palace to
lessen the chances of having to deal with Mike. Lily and Nicole sat nearbly in
the living room watching TV while Brooke stood beside Sam and offered a
comforting smile. </p>
<p>"Jane McPherson," a weary voice answered after the second
ring. </p>
<p>"Jane? It's Terri Williams, Brooke's aunt. I was calling to
see if you'd heard anything from the girls yet." There was a heavy sorrow-filled
sigh from the other end of the phone. </p>
<p>"Oh, hello Terri. No, I haven't heard from them. I really wish
they'd call. I'm so worried," Jane confessed in a voice thick with unshed tears. </p>
<p>"Well, I'm sure they're fine. And they're probably worried
about Mike tracing them, Jane," Terri pointed out as Sam and Brooke listened
silently from the cordless extention. </p>
<p>"I know. He's being such an unreasonable ass," Jane
complained. "And I let him get away with it because I was wrapped up in my own
shock." </p>
<p>"I'm sure they understand. But if you did hear from them,
would you ask them to come home?" Terri asked. </p>
<p>"Ask them but not force them. Can you do me a favor Terri and
if you hear from them tell them to call me here at work? The phone at home is
tapped. Mike had a friend tap it for him but this one isn't," Jane said
hopefully. Terri smiled at Sam and Brooke. </p>
<p>"Can you hang on a second, Jane?" she asked as she handed the
phone to Sam. "Go ahead, girls, talk away. I have to get to work." Sam took the
phone but eyed it warily. She looked at Brooke who nodded at her to say
something. </p>
<p>"Mo?Mom?" Sam whispered. There was a gasp and a long pause on
the other end of the phone. </p>
<p>"Sammy?" Jane asked barely audible. </p>
<p>"I miss you, Mom," Sam answered in tears. She could hear her
mother crying over the phone and she could see Brooke's face streaked with tears
a few feet away. </p>
<p>"Oh, baby, are you all right? I miss you too. I'm so sorry. Is
Brooke with you?" Jane shot off in rapid succession making Sam giggle.
</p>
<p>"I'm OK Mom and yes, Brooke's right here. She's fine too, we
all are." </p>
<p>"Hi, Mom," Brooke said into the cordless. </p>
<p>"Brooke! Oh God, it's so wonderful to hear your voices. To
know you're alive," Jane gushed excitedly. Guilt flushed through both girls. </p>
<p>"We're sorry we left like that, Mom. But we couldn't let Dad
do what he was threatening," Brooke explained firmly. "These are our lives he's
playing with." </p>
<p>"I know, Brooke. And I'm sorry I didn't put a stop to it
sooner. I just got caught up in his hysteria and my own shock. And then when
Gayle and Maria got involved," she paused a minute. "How are Lily and Nicole?"
Said couple were curled up on the couch watching All My Children together. Sam
laughed. </p>
<p>"Peachy," she informed her mother. "They have each other
although Lily is a bit homesick. Actually we all are even if Nic won't admit
it." </p>
<p>"What are Gayle and Maria up to?" Brooke asked getting Nicole
and Lily's attention at the mention of their mothers. Jane sighed. </p>
<p>"Gayle blames Maria, Maria blames Gayle. Half the town is
divided over `right side of the tracks' vs `wrong side'; white vs. Latino and
gay vs. straight," was the sad response. </p>
<p>"Wait a minute," Sam broke in. "Gay vs. straight? Jesus, does
the whole town know?" Nicole and Lily's eyes grew wide. </p>
<p>"Not all but you have been outed in a few social circles
thanks to Gayle's drunken mouth," Jane said disgusted. Sam and Brooke groaned. </p>
<p>"Someone shoot that drunken windbag, please," Sam begged.
Nicole rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"What did my pickled excuse for a maternal unit do now?" she
asked. Sam moved the phone away from her mouth to answer. </p>
<p>"Outed us to a large section of the city's population," she
explained. Nicole sighed and buried her face in her hands. </p>
<p>"That's fucking terrific," she complained bitterly. "Sorry
guys." Lily rubbed her back in soothing circles to calm her. </p>
<p>"Don't worry about it, Nic. I could care less. Sam?" Brooke
turned to Sam. </p>
<p>"Me either," Sam smiled. </p>
<p>"Or me," Lily added. Nicole nodded. </p>
<p>"How bad is it really, Mom?" Brooke asked. </p>
<p>"Well, it's mostly gossip about Nicole and Lily since it's
their parents making the most noise. Maria seems to think Nicole seduced Lily
with the lure of the Julian money and Gayle thinks that that's all Lily wants.
Neither one is willing to accept the reality that their daughter's are in love." </p>
<p>"But you do?" Sam asked in mild surprise. Jane laughed softly. </p>
<p>"I never thought I'd see the day when I'd associate that depth
of emotion with Nicole but yes. I was there for the floor show, Sam. I saw how
Lily reacted when Gayle threatened to send Nic away and the look of horror on
Nicole's face at the thought. Does she know how far she's fallen for Lily?" Jane
asked with a chuckle. Sam and Brooke laughed and looked at the two girls in
question. </p>
<p>Lily and Nicole were watching them with rapt attention. But
they were also somewhat wrapped around each other, taking comfort in the other's
presence and touch as they heard the news from home. Their hands were
intertwined and they were unconsciously leaned into one another. </p>
<p>"Yeah, I think she knows, Mom," Sam said exchanging smirks
with Brooke. Nicole and Lily looked at each other and shrugged. </p>
<p>"They're a very cute and very happy couple," Brooke added
making Lily and Nicole smile. Jane laughed. </p>
<p>"I did notice that. So are you and Sam," she added quietly.
Sam frowned as she looked at Brooke. </p>
<p>"How are you doing with that, Mom?" she asked gently. Jane
sighed. </p>
<p>"I'm dealing," she said honestly. "I mean, I'm not upset. I'm
shocked and confused. And worried." She paused to collect her thoughts. "But
you're still my girls and this doesn't change that. It'll take some getting used
to is all. I'm really ashamed of how I behaved and hope that you both can one
day forgive me," she finished through her tears. Sam and Brooke were crying as
well. </p>
<p>"We do Mom," Brooke said earning a nod from Sam. "Both of us." </p>
<p>"Thank you," Jane breathed. </p>
<p>"But now what so we do?" Sam asked. There was a long pause
from Jane before she answered. </p>
<p>"I don't know, girls. But now that I know where you are and
how to get a hold of you I feel a lot better. I have to get going soon but I
promise not to let anyone know where you are. However, until things calm down I
think it would be for the best if you stayed with Terri," she suggested. Sam
sighed. </p>
<p>"OK, Mom," she relented. </p>
<p>"Call me here at work anytime you need to and I'll call you
when I can. Thank Terri for me, Brooke." </p>
<p>"I will," Brooke promised. </p>
<p>"We'll figure something out. Or if it comes right down to it
we'll look at the schools in the area and transfer the four of you. We'll find a
way through this mess, I promise." </p>
<p>"Thanks Mom, I love you," Sam said. </p>
<p>"Love you and miss you both," Jane responded. </p>
<p>"Love you, Mom," Brooke chirped. "Talk to you soon."
</p>
<p>"Bye Mom." </p>
<p>"Bye girls." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam and Brooke both felt much better after their talk with
Jane and they filled Nicole and Lily in on the gossip from home. Afterwards,
Brooke and Lily went into town while Sam and Nicole stayed at the house. Sam was
tired and wanted to lie down and Nicole didn't feel well. </p>
<p>"Are you sure the house will be standing when we get back?"
Lily asked with a smile. Brooke giggled. </p>
<p>"I think they can keep from killing each other long enough for
us to go grocery shopping," Brooke pointed out. </p>
<p>"Just checking," Lily said with a smirk. She looked at Brooke
carefully. "How are you doing Brooke?" she asked seriously. </p>
<p>"I could ask you the same thing," Brooke responded. "But I'm
fine and happy, circumstances aside." </p>
<p>"So am I," Lily agreed. "I'm glad you woke up and found your
happiness with Sam." Brooke smiled. </p>
<p>"Thanks. I think. And I'm glad you find yours with Nicole. As
surprising as that was." </p>
<p>"I know. I never would have thought that I could be happy with
someone other than Sam. But Nicole just fills up my heart, Brooke. I can't
explain it," Lily sighed happily. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"You don't have to. If it's anything like what Sam does for me
then I understand. You know, I'm really glad you and I have been able to stay
friends. I imagine it hasn't been easy," Brooke said carefully. Lily frowned
slightly. </p>
<p>"Well, at first seeing you with the girl that I loved so much
it hurt really made me mad. But Nicole changed that. I saw that there was
someone out there other than Sam. She's not a replacement for Sam because
there's nothing to replace. Nicole is unique and I love her." </p>
<p>"Good, I'm glad," Brooke said sincerely. </p>
<p>"And you love Sam. In the end we all got what we wanted,
Brooke. Love." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam had finally slipped into a light sleep when Nicole knocked
on her door. </p>
<p>"Yo, Spammage, can we talk?" Nicole asked as she walked in.
Sam groaned and rolled over. </p>
<p>"If you think you can manage to say my name correctly," Sam
mumbled. Nicole surprised her by sitting on the edge of the bed next to her. </p>
<p>"OK, Sam, I think I can do that," she agreed. Sam opened her
eyes and fixed them on the usually caustic blonde next to her. </p>
<p>"What's up, Nic?" she asked. Nicole chewed on her lip for a
few minutes and actually seemed at a loss for words. This piqued Sam's interest
even more since Nicole wasn't known for not having something to say. Nicole
usually had too much to say, at inopportune moments. </p>
<p>"I just wanted to say, that is I..." Nic fumbled. Sam scooted
further up on the bed to watch the rare show of Nicole Julian stumbling over her
words. She had an idea what Nicole wanted to say, but wanted to hear it for
sheer pleasure's sake. </p>
<p>"You can do it, Nic. It won't kill you," she teased. Nicole
glared at her. </p>
<p>"Thank you. OK, happy? I said it," Nic sighed. Sam laughed. </p>
<p>"OK, but what for?" she asked between giggles. Nic ran a hand
through her hair. </p>
<p>"Argh, you had to make this harder than it already was, didn't
you?" Sam nodded happily. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity and she
wasn't about to waste it. </p>
<p>"Fine. Look, you and Brooke didn't have to take Lily and I
with you. Or let us stay with the two of you here. It's made things easier for
Lil to have a few of her friends to help her through this." Sam frowned at her. </p>
<p>"What about you?" she asked seriously. Nic laughed bitterly. </p>
<p>"I have Lily, I'm fine," she bluffed. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Liar. Nicole, you don't have to be the emotionless ice queen
anymore. That act doesn't mean jack out here. You can be Nicole, the one that
Lily loves. No one is going to think you're weak if you're sad and homesick.
Honest," she said sincerely. Nicole stared at Sam for a few minutes trying to
find the brunette's angle, how she was going to use her vulnerability, if Nic
showed any, against her. But she could only see genuine friendship and caring in
Sam's eyes. And it surprised her. Finally, with a smile, Nic nodded. </p>
<p>"Thanks, Sam," she said softly. "I do miss home. But that's
not where we belong right now, is it?" Sam shook her head. "Yeah, well, we will
go home eventually. And kick all our parents asses to the ocean and back." </p>
<p>"Right on!" Sam agreed. Nic stood up to leave. </p>
<p>"Thanks for the talk, Sam. Go back to your nap. And if you
tell anyone when we get home that I apologized to you, I'll shave you bald in
your sleep." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Argh, remind me NEVER to let the two of you go grocery
shopping alone again!" Sam complained as she rummaged through the bags of food.
There was no junk food in sight. </p>
<p>"Sammy, you can not live a healthy life on Jax and Chips
Ahoy," Brooke pointed out patiently. Sam whined and pouted at her. </p>
<p>"Please tell me you bought something with a high fat and sugar
content. Please?" she begged. Brooke reached into a shopping bag with a sigh and
tossed a bag of Oreos at her. Sam clutched the bag like a valued prize and
happily tore into it. </p>
<p>"I don't get how someone who eats like that can look like
that," Nicole complained to Lily as they put the groceries away. </p>
<p>"Good genes?" Lily offered. Nicole shook her head. </p>
<p>"A cruel joke from God," she countered. "I so much as LOOK at
an Oreo and I get a zit and gain three pounds. It's not fair." </p>
<p>"Fast metabolism," Sam explained around a mouthful of Oreo.
Brooke crinkled her nose. </p>
<p>"I so didn't need to see your food, Sammy," she complained.
She turned to Nic and Lily. "Besides, it's not like she doesn't get exercise."
Sam turned bright red and fled the room as Lily and Nicole burst out laughing.
Brooke reviewed her words and groaned. </p>
<p>"That's not what I meant, you two," she sighed. "Although..."
she trailed off with a smirk. "No, she jogs in the morning while you two are
still snoring away." </p>
<p>"Suuuuuure," Lily teased as she put away a box of pasta.
Nicole snorted next to her. Brooke shook her finger at them both. </p>
<p>"You two have very dirty minds," she scolded. </p>
<p>"This from one of the two sex-crazed weasels," Nicole said
while jerking a thumb in Brooke's direction. Lily giggled. Brooke arched an
eyebrow. </p>
<p>"I am not a sex-crazed form of rodent, thank you," she
retorted. "I love Sam and I love to have sex with her, yes. But I am not a
small, four-legged, hairy creature with beady little eyes." Nic's hands flew to
cover her ears. </p>
<p>"I don't need to hear about your sex life with Spam! I don't
wanna be scarred for life anymore than I already am," she protested. Terri
walked into the room to the display. </p>
<p>"Why is Nicole doing her impression of the 'Hear no evil'
monkey?" she asked with a grin. "And why is Sam fire engine red and binging on
Oreos in the den?" Brooke rolled her eys. </p>
<p>"God, I'd better go stop her before she eats the whole bag and
makes herself sick," she said as she headed for the den. Terri looked at Lily
who was laughing like a fool and arched an eyebrow as Nicole removed her hands
from her ears. Nic gave her an out of place and unrealistic innocent smile.
Terri shook her head. </p>
<p>"Well, I can see having the four of you around means there'll
never be a dull moment," she said wryly with a grin. </p>
