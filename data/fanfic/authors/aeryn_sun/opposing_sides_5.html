<!-- Opposing Sides \ Chapter 5 -->

<p>Brooke splashed her face with cold water and looked at her flushed reflection. (You're pathetic, you know that?) she told herself. She had just enjoyed a lustful and intense daydream involving Sam in her bedroom and was quickly realizing that she was getting out of hand. She'd never been this bad before, never wanted someone the way that she wanted Sam. Not even Josh. Josh had been a pity screw each time and she knew it. And pity sex was the worst kind of sex. It always left her feeling empty and guilty. Even her fantasies about Sam left her feeling better than that. </p>
<p>"I need to talk to somebody about this," she told her reflection. She could hear Sam rustling around in her room and felt the now familiar and frustrating flare in her lower abdomen. She growled in anger at her reflection. </p>
<p>"Get a grip you hormone crazed nutjob," she scolded. Sam banged on the door. </p>
<p>"You done in there, McQueen?" she yelled angrily. "There are other people in the house that need the bathroom, you know!" Brooke winced. Sam was obviously still mad over their altercation a few days ago. Taking a deep breath to gain control of herself, she opened the door to Sam's room and faced the still irate Sam. </p>
<p>"All yours," she said as Sam glowered at her. Brooke felt her pulse quicken as she caught sight of Sam in her robe holding a towel, prepared for a shower and wondered if Sam had anything on under the robe. She shook the thoughts from her head as Sam continued to glare. </p>
<p>"Gee, thanks," Sam snarled as she pushed past Brooke and slammed the door behind her leaving Brooke in her room. Brooke looked around the natural disaster area that was Sam's room and breathed in Sam's scent. She figured it'd freak Sam out if she knew what she was doing but didn't care, she loved the way Sam smelled. </p>
<p>She heard the shower start and decided that leaving before her hormones got the better of her would be a good idea. Besides, with Sam in the shower, that meant she was free to talk to Jane without interruption. Brooke headed downstairs and found Jane in the living room. </p>
<p>"Mom, can I talk to you?" she asked. Jane looked up from her book and smiled. </p>
<p>"Sure hon, go ahead," she said. Brooke flopped down in the chair and hugged a pillow against her chest. Now she had to find a way to say this without freaking Jane out. </p>
<p>"Mom, I've got this friend with this problem," she started, hating herself for the lie but not brave enough to tell the truth just yet. Jane set down her book and focused her full attention on Brooke. </p>
<p>"OK." </p>
<p>"Well, see, she's been developing these feelings for someone, really intense feelings and she doesn't know what to do about them," Brooke explained. Jane paled a bit. </p>
<p>"Brooke, what do you mean?" she asked. </p>
<p>"Well, this friend is a girl and her feelings are for a girl," she said quietly. Jane nodded and let out a long sigh. </p>
<p>"Brooke, honey, Sam already talked to me about this," Jane said softly. Brooke's eyebrows leapt to the top of her forehead. </p>
<p>"Wha??" </p>
<p>"Sam talked to me yesterday about this and I'm OK with her being gay, hon. And I think it's great that she was comfortable enough to talk to you about it. It shows how far you two have come in your relationship," Jane said happily. Brooke's head was spinning. </p>
<p>(Sam's gay?) she tried to wrap her mind around that one. </p>
<p>"So, you don't need to worry about Sam, Brooke. She's dealing and so am I," Jane continued as Brooke's head came close to exploding. Brooke stood up and stumbled back towards the stairs. </p>
<p>"Uh, that's great, Mom," she managed. "I'm glad she came to you. Could you not tell her I did? She might think of it as breaking confidence," Brooke bluffed. Jane nodded understanding. </p>
<p>"Of course, Brooke. I won't say a word. I think it's great that you care enough to try and help her." </p>
<p>"Yeah, sure, no problem," Brooke mumbled as she started up the stairs. "Later Mom." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke collapsed back onto her bed, her head just a swirling jumble of thoughts. (Sam's gay? Sam has feelings for someone? Wait, wait, wait. SAM'S GAY!?) She couldn't and wouldn't dare hope that Sam had feelings for her. (Who could it be? Lily? Carmen? Nic?) She laughed outloud at that last one. (Only if they both have death wishes. Who, who, who?) </p>
<p>She rolled over onto her stomach and let her mind wander over into the `what if?' category. (What if it is me? Oh God, can I be that lucky? And does she still feel something after the mean things I said the other day?) She heard the shower turn off and tried to ignore the vivid pictures of a naked wet Sam that suddenly ran rampant through her mind. Now was not the time for fantasies. </p>
<p>(I could just ask) she pondered, but figured doing so would probably only get her a slap across the face as opposed to a direct answer. Sam was funny like that. (Hee, Sam's gay. I got a shot) the eternal optomist in Brooke found that the glass was half full. (And) she decided (I fully intend to find a way to take my shot) </p>
