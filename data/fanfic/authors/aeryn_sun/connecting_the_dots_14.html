<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Fourteen -->

<p>Brooke was annoyed. She was barely two hours into the school
day and all ready she felt like a circus sideshow freak. Everyone by now had
heard of her accident and subsequent memory loss and too many seemed to delight
in asking her innane questions. Everything from people claiming to be her best
friend to guys insisting that she used to have the hots for them and to meet
them out back for a quickie. Apparently to them, memory loss equalled morals
loss as well. She was SO not amused. </p>
<p>She was happy to see that she shared quite a few classes with
Sam. And thanks to the miracles of the alphabet they sat next to or around each
other as well. At least she wasn't totally alone in her journey through the
school, even if Sam was still a guarded towards her. </p>
<p>Nicole and Mary Cherry outright ignored her or worked to ruin
her entire day. Teasing, biting comments and a bit of physical intimidation were
their weapons of choice. But Brooke shrugged them off. She found the two blondes
about as threatening as a pair of toothless bunny slippers. Everytime Nicole
opened her mouth to make a biting comment, Brooke would bark at her which
totally through Nicole off her groove. And (thanks to a juicy tidbit of
information from Sam) she quacked like a duck at Mary Cherry. Overall, their
reign of terror on her was incredibly short lived. </p>
<p>It became apparent as the weeks dragged on that even without
her memory, without Nicole and Mary Cherry as her henchmen and with a whole new
attitude, Brooke was still queen. It confused the heck out of her and Sam both.
This Brooke, while still nice and friendly, was also blunt, straight forward,
and not a tad bit impish. She said what she thought when she wanted, how she
wanted, and to whoever she wanted. She was no longer constricted by the role she
felt she had to play, having no memory of that person. It confused some people,
insulted others, but attracted far more to her circle of admirers. And it still
left Nicole and Mary Cherry as second and third banana to her and still playing
catch up. </p>
<p>Unfortunately Sam's social status didn't improve much. She was
still the budding journalist, still slightly an outsider to everyone else. It
bothered Brooke to see everyone still treating Sam coldly. But she knew that Sam
had put off talking to Lily and Carmen for whatever reason. And without those
two, or Harrison, the brunette was effectively treading water in a lonely sea. </p>
<p>Not that Sam seemed to mind. Brooke watched somewhat awed as
day after day Sam plowed through the crap thrown at her, her head down and focus
determined. It was obvious that other people's opinions meant very little to
her. She was content to do her thing and to Hell with everyone else. Brooke
found that she really admired that trait and tried to emulate it. </p>
<p>"Stay away from the Manager's Special," Sam warned playfully
at lunch the next week. She sat down and gave Brooke a sly, conspiritorial look. </p>
<p>"Rumor has it," she continued in a hushed tone that sent
pleasant chills down Brooke's spine. "According to my sources, the meat is
actually the missing kids from detention." Brooke chuckled. </p>
<p>"Ew, you're bad," she accused giving Sam a slight nudge. </p>
<p>"No I'm not," Sam protested with a shake of her head. "I am
simply horribly misunderstood." Brooke laughed as Sam tried her best to look as
innocent as possible. </p>
<p>"Someone's in a good mood today," Brooke pointed out as Sam
grinned. </p>
<p>"'Someone' just got an 'A' on their chem quiz," Sam informed
her happily. </p>
<p>"Good for you, I know you were worried about that. You sure
studied enough," Brooke responded. "Hey, we should do something to celebrate."
Sam arched an eyebrow in question. </p>
<p>"It was only a quiz, Brooke. Hardly cause for celebration,"
she argued softly. Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, it is too. I know how hard chemistry is for you, Sam. You
studied and got an 'A', you should be rewarded." </p>
<p>"OK, any ideas?" Sam asked. Brooke smirked impishly.
</p>
<p>"Oh, a few," she said cryptically. For some reason the tone of
her voice made Sam blush slightly. "Leave it to me, Sammy." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"You're kidding!" Sam exclaimed incredulously later that
night. "Porn and wine coolers? Why Brooke, I'm shocked at you!" Brooke laughed. </p>
<p>"Why? Because it's so 'unBrooke-like'?" she asked. Sam nodded.
"I'm a brand new girl, Sammy. You know that." </p>
<p>"Yeah, I suppose I do. Still, though, pornos and alcohol?
How'd you manage to pull it off?" Sam wondered as she popped the top off a
bottle of grapekiwi wine cooler. Brooke smirked and opened her own bottle. </p>
<p>"I have my ways," she answered. "Besides, with Mom and Dad
away for the next few days, we have the house to ourselves and can do what we
want." </p>
<p>"You've become such a delinquent," Sam accused with a giggle.
"I love it." Brooke grinned and put in a video. </p>
<p>"How does 'The Erotic Witch Project' sound to you?" she asked
Sam. </p>
<p>"God, where do they come up with the names?" Sam laughed.
Brooke shrugged. They watched the video while drinking their wine coolers,
occasionally making comments to the screen and laughing. When it was over,
Brooke chose another one and pushed play. </p>
<p>"'Where the Boys Aren't?' Brooke, I'm starting to wonder about
you," Sam joked as a deep blush rose to her cheeks. She hoped that both the
comment and the blush were alcohol induced. Brooke stared at her for a second
but said nothing. They watched the movie and continued to drink, both becoming
pleasantly buzzed. Brooke was also getting slightly turned on by the video. She
kept shooting quick glances at Sam lying on the couch and wondering what she was
thinking. </p>
<p>"Sam?" Brooke spoke up, letting the drink fuel her next line
of questioning. She figured if nothing else, she could blame it on that.
</p>
<p>"Yeah?" Sam answered while stretching on the couch. Brooke
almost told her how sexy she looked like that but had enough presence of mind to
keep that to herself. </p>
<p>"What's your opinion on sex?" she asked bluntly. Sam choked on
the sip of wine cooler she had in her mouth and took a minute to compose
herself. </p>
<p>"What?" she asked shocked. Brooke smiled at the reaction as
Sam's eyes widened. </p>
<p>"Your opinion on sex. What do you think about it? Y'know?" she
tried to clarify and then frowned because she had just confused herself. Sam
took a long swig from her bottle and shrugged. </p>
<p>"I dunno, really. I think...I think that it's a lost art," she
finally decided. Brooke shifted in her chair to watch Sam more closely. She
quirked an eyebrow at the brunette. </p>
<p>"How so?" </p>
<p>"Well, I think people are more interested in instant
gratification than the actual act itself. I mean, you're talking about the most
intimate and deep connection you can have with another person. It's you, no
masks, no acts. You at your most honest and vulnerable. No pretense, y'know?"
Sam responded as her blush deepened. She couldn't believe that not only had
Brooke asked the question, but she herself was answering it. </p>
<p>"I think but keep going," Brooke encouraged, loving yet
another glimpse at the real Sam. Sam finished her drink and reached for another. </p>
<p>"OK. And this is just my over romantasized opinion, but there
should be more effort put into really learning your partner," by now Sam's color
was a deep rich red and her ears were burning but she kept going. "You're
talking about making love, it should be special, intense. Not just a 'wham, bam,
thank you ma'am'. But that's just my opinion." </p>
<p>"And I wanted to hear it, Sammy," Brooke said huskily. If the
porn and alcohol wasn't enough to wind her up, listening to Sam talk was. She
got up and walked over to the couch, watching Sam watch her carefully. She sat
down on the couch next to Sam and lightly brushed her hands against Sam's legs. </p>
<p>"Brooke?" Sam said softly. She watched as Brooke's heavy
lidded hazel eyes slowly traveled up her frame to finally focus on her eyes. The
look she saw there both excited her and confused her. Brooke's eyes were dark
with what Sam could only guess was desire and that excited her. But the fact
that that desire was directed at her confused her. </p>
<p>"Sammy?" Brooke answered, lowering her body so that it hovered
above Sam's. She swallowed the groan that arose as she felt the heat coming from
Sam's body. </p>
<p>"What are you doing?" Sam asked quietly as Brooke brought her
face to Sam's and stared at Sam's full lips. She watched them move as Sam spoke,
transfixed. She could feel the warmth of the other girl's breath on her face and
the gentle curves of Sam's body beneath hers. It only served to stroke the
growing fire within her. </p>
<p>"Nothing," she whispered leaning closer to Sam's face. "But I
am about to kiss you." Without giving Sam time to protest, Brooke brushed her
lips against Sam's loving the soft velvety feel to them. Sam tried to pull away
at first, the alarms in her head blaring loudly. But she had no where to go,
pressed against the couch as she was as Brooke deepened the kiss. She felt
Brooke's tongue lick at her bottom lip and was unable to stop the whimper from
escaping her as Brooke's tongue entered her mouth gently probing. She met
Brooke's tongue with her own and felt the blonde sigh. They were content to lay
there kissing for several long minutes. </p>
<p>Suddenly, the alcohol haze lifted from her mind and Sam
realized what she was doing. She was kissing Brooke! She ripped her lips away
from Brooke's skilled embrace and managed to squirm out from beneath the
cheerleaders tempting body. She landed on the floor with a thump and rested her
head in her shakey hands. </p>
<p>"Sam?" Brooke reached out to put a hand on Sam's shaking
shoulder in concern. </p>
<p>"Brooke, don't. We...I...this shouldn't...no. I can't," Sam
stuttered looking at Brooke with a look of grief on her face. Brooke frowned at
her. </p>
<p>"Sammy..." she started. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, it's wrong. We're friends and step-sisters and...and...it
shouldn't have happened," she tried to reason, panic beginning to overwhelm her.
She had let her emotions get control over her and things had gone too far. Sam
stood up hastily and almost ran for the stairs. </p>
<p>"Sam!" Brooke called out to stop her. Sam looked back and
shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, Brooke. I am SO so sorry," she cried before rushing up
the stairs and locking herself in her room. Brooke lay on the couch cursing
herself for her actions. </p>
<p>(Damn! There's no fixing that. She MUST know how I feel now)
Brooke thought to herself in despair. (I didn't meant to scare her. I just...I
want...I just destroyed everything, didn't I?) Sobs overtook her as she realized
that there would be no misinterpreting her actions and Sam would most likely
never forgive her. She had gambled everything, and lost. Big time. </p>
