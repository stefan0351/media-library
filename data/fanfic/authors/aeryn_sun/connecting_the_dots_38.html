<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Thirty Eight -->

<p>Still reeling from the news about Harrison, the girls figured that the Pink concert would be a perfect escape. A night when they could just cut loose and forget about real life for a little while. And everything went perfectly that night. They arrived early and met a cute blonde girl who called herself Buff Buff sitting with them in the front row. She helped them pass the time until show time by talking and joking around with them.</p>
<p>Brooke liked the opening act, Candy Ass; Sam hated them. It was a small source of strife between the two of them for awhile but as soon as Pink appeared, they centered their attention on her. Sam and Brooke sang and shouted themselves hoarse before returning home late that night with t-shirts, glow sticks, and a pair of Candy Ass panties for Brooke.</p>
<p>After sleeping through most of the next day, Saturday, the duo got up and lounged around the house doing nothing. They ended up curled up on the couch watching an overly edited rerun of 'Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me' on television.</p>
<p>"Are you sure you want to skip the Senior Prom, Brooke? If we get going now we can still make it," Sam reminded her. "It's a once in a lifetime event." Brooke snorted.</p>
<p>"So was last year. And we both barely survived it that time. God only knows what Nicole is apt to pull this year. I'd rather stay home with you, where it's safe," she refuted.</p>
<p>"Good point," Sam agreed. They grew quiet again.</p>
<p>"Finals are next week, Sammy. You ready?" Brooke asked a little later. Sam shrugged.</p>
<p>"Eh. As long as I don't freeze in French and answer 'Quelle heure est-il?' with 'il est beau' again this year, I think I'll be good."</p>
<p>"In your defense, it was a beautiful day that day," Brooke snickered. Sam mock glared at her.</p>
<p>"It was also 9:37 AM," she pointed out. "At least she gave me half credit for it so it wasn't a total loss." She then looked at Brooke. "You remember that day?" Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"I was still in denial, I remember that. It was just after the accident, or rather, the NEAR accident. You were the one having the headaches at the time," Brooke sank into Sam's arms as she reminisced. "You had hit pretty hard when you shoved me out of the way." Again, like when she first recalled the memory of Sam being hurt, she traced the area as if seeing a phantom of the injury.</p>
<p>"Denial, huh?" Sam teased. Brooke huffed at her.</p>
<p>"I couldn't understand why you'd done what you had, almost been killed for me. And yet you were barely speaking to me. It was like you couldn't stand me for winning Harrison or something. And then I didn't understand why that bothered me so much. And why I just wanted to hold you until you didn't hurt anymore."</p>
<p>"Really?" Sam asked, surprised.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I dreamed about holding you a lot. Some nights I was afraid to fall asleep because I knew you'd be in my dreams. You seemed to haunt me and it scared me. I didn't understand it for the longest time that I was in love with you. I wouldn't LET myself be in love with you. Because if I DID love you, that'd be admitting that I was gay, which was something I'd fought for a long time. And it didn't fit with my 'popular' image and all that crap. I swear, Sam, sometimes I am SO glad I hit that stupid tree."</p>
<p>"As sick as it may sound, sometimes so am I," Sam admitted. She cuddled closer to Brooke.</p>
<p>"And that particular day, you had on the hottest, tightest pair of jeans I'd ever seen you in," Brooke giggled. "I couldn't take my eyes off your ass." Sam thought for a minute and then started to laugh.</p>
<p>"They were YOUR jeans!" she explained. "I had no clean clothes so I squeezed into a spare pair of yours when you weren't in your room." Brooke smirked.</p>
<p>"That explains why they looked so familiar. They looked a lot better on you than they did me," Brooke smiled in remembrance. "I remember being all confused because of the thoughts that were going through my head. God, I wanted you, bad. But I had Harrison and a roll to play."</p>
<p>"And now you have me," Sam said quietly. "You're free."</p>
<p>"And happy," Brooke added. She sat quietly in Sam's arms for a long time as the movie wrapped up. She was about to say more when she heard Sam's soft breathing in her ear indicating that she'd fallen asleep. Smiling, Brooke settled into Sam's arms and followed her brunette lover into dreamland, happy and satisfied with the way things had turned out.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>When she returned to school the following Monday, Brooke was the reigning heroine. She was still being congratulated on her boxing debut and some students were even offering her money to go for a round two. Sadly, in Sam's opinion at least, she declined the offer.</p>
<p>Brooke knew that it was only a matter of time before Nicole came to collect her revenge.</p>
<p>And she didn't have to wait long.</p>
<p>"I'm going to sue you for every little penny your precious Daddy has, Brookie-dear," Nicole hissed at her late Monday in the Novak. Brooke and Sam exchanged glances.</p>
<p>"Oh get a grip," Sam sighed. Nicole narrowed her blackened eyes at her.</p>
<p>"You'd better believe that I have a very firm grip, Spam," she spat. "With the school systems the way that they are now, the courts LOVE to make examples out of school violence cases. And Queen B McQueen here attacked me in a room full of witnesses, without provocation. Do you have ANY idea what it's going to cost to get my nose to look like Gwynyth's again?" she ranted. Brooke's jaw hit the floor.</p>
<p>"Wait just a damn minute," Brooke broke in. "Attacked you without provocation? You tried to kill me last spring! Or did you think I wouldn't remember?" Nicole took a step back from Brooke's hot, raw ire.</p>
<p>"Well, let me tell you something, bitch," Brooke growled. Sam just leaned back and let her go, enjoying the show. "I DID remember! Every last damned detail. And not only did you almost kill me but you almost cost Sam her life too. THAT'S what I hit you for!" Brooke was just about screaming now and Nicole looked like she knew she'd just poked a sleeping bear with a stick.</p>
<p>"So let me ask you this," Brooke continued. "Why haven't you been punished for that little drunk driving spree that night? Huh? Who do YOU think the court is more likely to punish here? Me, someone who finally, after years of being pushed around, used and abused by YOU, finally struck back? Or YOU, someone who nearly killed two innocent people? Which one of us is truly the guilty party here?"</p>
<p>Nicole shrank away and then stalked to the door, sensing her defeat and trying to save face.</p>
<p>"Fine," she shot out. "But I'm warning you: if my nose ends up looking more like Streisand than Paltrow when this is over, I WILL have my revenge!" She stormed out, slamming the door behind her. Sam followed her to the door and made sure she was gone. Brooke stood huffing, watching her go.</p>
<p>"I'll get you my pretty," Sam cackled, doing her best 'Wicked Witch of the West' impersonation from 'The Wizard of Oz'. "And your little dog too."</p>
<p>"God, she makes me so MAD!" Brooke seethed. "Her and her superior attitude." Sam smirked.</p>
<p>"It still seems strange sometimes to hear you talk like that about your best friend."</p>
<p>"FORMER best friend," Brooke corrected her. "I don't understand why I put up with her shit for as long as I did." She leaned against the sinks with her back and rubbed at her eyes.</p>
<p>"Because you weren't strong enough to step away and stand on your own," Sam explained simply walking closer. "You are now." Brooke gave her a small smile.</p>
<p>"Because I have you," she said. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"No. Maybe I gave you the incentive somehow but no, the strength is all yours." She leaned in and kissed Brooke wildly, passionately, pinning the blonde against the sinks.</p>
<p>"What was that for?" Brooke panted when they parted, stroking Sam's cheek with her fingertips. Sam blushed.</p>
<p>"That was the 'I'm-so-proud-of-you-and-yet-so-turned-on-by-you-I-want-you-right-here-on-the-floor' kiss," she explained shyly. Brooke giggled.</p>
<p>"The floor, huh? Not on the sinks?" Sam shook her head while biting her lip.</p>
<p>"Nuh-uh, maybe later," she purred.</p>
<p>"What about?" Brooke began uncertainly as Sam started to undress her.</p>
<p>"Stalls are empty, door's locked. I checked," Sam assured her. She looked deep into Brooke's eyes and Brooke could see the desire swirling deep in those dark pools.</p>
<p>"Please, Brooke? It's uh?" Sam swallowed convulsively. "It's one of my fantasies," she finished in a whisper. Brooke tugged on Sam's hair and brought her in for a fiery kiss.</p>
<p>"Then far be it from me to deny a lady," she answered huskily. "Just remember, Sam, we do still have to study for finals."</p>
<p>"We should definitely ace biology then?"</p>
