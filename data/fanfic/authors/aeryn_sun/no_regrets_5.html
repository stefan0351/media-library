<!-- No Regrets \ Building Blocks -->

<p>Brooke sat holding Sam against her chest as the injured brunette
worked with her new physical therapist, James. The blonde acted like
a back support, mostly because it was the only way Sam would agree to
cooperate right now. One thing that hadn't changed since the
accident was Sam's rock hard stubborn streak. She was blind and
relied on Brooke to help her. That included having her be there at
each therapy session as James helped Sam rebuild the muscles in her
weakened arms and legs.</p>
<p>"Come on, Sam?two more," James encouraged. Sam grunted disgustedly
and ground her teeth together.</p>
<p>"That's what you said two lifts ago," she complained. Brooke could
feel Sam's thin form trembling in her arms with the effort. She just
wanted to wrap the frail girl up in her arms and take away all the
pain she knew Sam was in, protect her from it and the trauma but she
knew that she couldn't. It was outside of her power so she tried to
do what she could to help Sam though it. It was all she could do.</p>
<p>"Jesus, that hurts," Sam hissed as James pushed against her left
foot. "Enough, stop."</p>
<p>"Sam," James sighed as he gently set her foot back down on the
mat. "We've gone over this, kiddo. It's going to hurt. You've got
broken bones healing and muscles which have atrophied that we have to
get moving again before you suffer permanent nerve damage. If you
want full function back, almost 100% of what you had before the
accident, then you have to WORK at it. And it's going to hurt but
eventually, you'll work through that, get past it. If you work at
it, Sam, you will get better."</p>
<p>"I find your mock concern for my well-being condescending," Sam
snapped. "Especially given that the only reason you're here is
because you're being paid to be."</p>
<p>"Sammy?" Brooke scolded gently. Sam frowned around her special light
blocking glasses that hid her beautiful brown eyes from Brooke.
Brooke hated those glasses for that reason but understood that they
were necessary to protect Sam's eyes.</p>
<p>"Well, it's true. He looks at a file of papers with my name and
history on it, decides on a course of treatment, works with me, one
of many patients by the way, collects his paycheck and goes on his
merry way. He doesn't give a rat's ass, in reality, what happens to
me one way or the other as long as the hospital signs his check and
it doesn't bounce. As long as my insurance is good, he's happy."</p>
<p>"Oh and as long as I get to bask in the presence of your sunny
disposition I'm happy as well," James added, sending a wink to Brooke
to let her know he wasn't in the least offended by Sam's out of
character angry tirade. "But since your time is up, I'll just be `on
my merry way', as you put it."</p>
<p>James and Brooke helped a stubborn and surly Sam back into her
wheelchair and after giving Brooke some instructions for the day and
handling Sam, James left. Brooke started pushing Sam back on the
trek to her room when Sam suddenly broke the oppressive silence.</p>
<p>"Did you know that it's nauseating to be pushed around and not be
able to see where it is you're going?" Her tone wasn't angry; it was
questioning, like she really wondered if Brooke was aware of the
fact. Outside the presence of others, Sam acted more like the Sam
Brooke was familiar with and not like the angry person she was
towards everyone else.</p>
<p>"I can only imagine," Brooke admitted quietly.</p>
<p>"It's like, I have to totally trust whoever's pushing me around, that
they won't just shove me down a staircase. It's unnerving," Sam
elaborated. Brooke brushed at some of Sam's short brown hair,
already turning curly as it grew out again.</p>
<p>"I bet. But just so you know, Sammy, I have no intentions of shoving
you down any staircases any time soon," she smiled, a hint of
laughter coloring her voice.</p>
<p>"That's good to know," Sam mumbled quietly as she leaned back into
Brooke's touch. When she was with Brooke was the only time when the
rage she felt bubbling below the surface seemed to fade into the
background and she felt safe and happy.</p>
<p>Sam hated not being able to see. She figured that she might have
been able to deal with everything else; the broken bones, weak
muscles, physical therapy and so on if she could just SEE what was
going on around her. She valued her ability to watch someone when
they spoke to her, she was a firm believer in eye contact to gauge
someone's honesty and being able to see their body react when they
spoke. Now she was robbed of all of that and it pissed her off and
left her feeling isolated and vulnerable.</p>
<p>"I only just got you back," Brooke said quietly, sadness and pain
clear to Sam in her voice. "I don't want to lose you again."</p>
<p>Sam reached up and gently grasped Brooke's hand in her own.</p>
<p>"Hey, don't cry, Brooke," she whispered. Brooke smiled again as she
tried to blink the hot tears away.</p>
<p>"How'd you know?" she asked, surprised that Sam knew that she'd
started to silently cry.</p>
<p>"Your voice. It cracked and then dipped. It only does that when
you're trying not to cry," Sam explained.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well, you know me too well," Brooke sniffed. "Here we are,
back at your room. So, do you want a shower or just to relax in your
bed?" Sam sighed.</p>
<p>"There's too much crap involved in taking a shower. You have to call
a nurse so that she can set it up and blah blah?I'm too tired."</p>
<p>"OK, no problem. Let's get you back into the bed then," Brooke
helped Sam onto the bed and then parked her wheelchair a few feet
away. "Are you hungry? Thirsty?" Sam laughed.</p>
<p>"Brooke, I'm fine, just tired. I'll let you know if I need anything,
I promise," she said as she reached up and took off her glasses. She
then arched an eyebrow and looked in Brooke's general direction. "Are
you going to join me?"</p>
<p>Brooke slid into the bed upon request and wrapped her arms around Sam
who leaned into her. She reached out and started to trace her
fingertips lightly across Brooke's face, down her cheeks and over her
lips.</p>
<p>"Say it again?" Sam whispered softly. She felt the corners of
Brooke's mouth quirk upward slightly as she rested her fingers there.</p>
<p>"I love you, Sammy," Brooke answered, knowing what Sam meant and
loving that Sam liked to hear it. "I love you." She felt Sam's
fingers still tracing her lips as she spoke.</p>
<p>"Brooke, that night?before the Prom?" Sam blushed and bit her lip
which Brooke thought was adorable.</p>
<p>"Mmmm, I remember," Brooke said fondly. She felt Sam shiver slightly
in her arms at the tone of her voice and reminded herself that Sam
was still injured and that it'd be a long time before they ever got
to repeat that wonderful experience, if Sam ever wanted to.</p>
<p>"I never really did say `Thank you', did I?" Sam leaned in a little
closer and kissed Brooke's jaw lightly.</p>
<p>"You don't need to, Sammy. But you're welcome and it's mutual,"
Brooke babbled. Sam was retracing the path of her fingers had taken
with her mouth, lightly grazing Brooke's cheek.</p>
<p>Their lips met in a careful but loving kiss. Brooke was worried
about Sam's physical condition and hurting her while Sam couldn't see
if a kiss was really what Brooke wanted. After a moment, they
relaxed into each other and started to lose themselves until the
sound of a clearing throat disturbed them.</p>
<p>Brooke gasped and Sam cursed her sightlessness.</p>
<p>"Shit?" Brooke groaned.</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't wanna know, do I?" Sam grumbled. She tried to listen
for a clue as to who was at the door but whoever it was didn't move.</p>
<p>"Hi Daddy," Brooke said meekly and Sam thought she was going to throw
up.</p>
<p>"I wish I had a camera for the looks on your faces right now," Mike joked after he felt they'd suffered in silence long enough. Both girls were deathly pale and Brooke looked like a deer caught in the headlights.</p>
<p>"Dad, I?we can explain?" Brooke choked out. Mike approached the bed and crossed his arms over his chest.</p>
<p>"Explain what? That you two are in love? Have been for a while and that's why Sam pushed you out of the way of that car? That's why you've been at her side non-stop since that night, begging her to wake up, Brooke?" Mike asked. Brooke opened her mouth to respond but then just nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I knew that, honey," Mike said gently. "I kept hoping that you'd come to me and open up so that you didn't have go through all this alone but, I guess I can't blame you for not doing so."</p>
<p>He sat down on the end of the bed with a sigh.</p>
<p>"I know this has been so hard for you, for you both. But please don't think you have to hide from me. The last thing I'm going to do is make this any harder, especially when I see how happy you seem to make each other, how Sam came back to YOU, Brooke. That's a big thing. I'm OK with this, honest."</p>
<p>"What about my Mom?" Sam asked as Brooke hugged her Dad. Mike hissed.</p>
<p>"OK, HER I'd hide from. She hasn't been handling ANYTHING well, Sammy, ever since the accident. She's gotten mean, if you'll excuse me for saying so," he explained.</p>
<p>"She did the same thing after my Dad died," Sam said flatly. "She doesn't do `stress' well, I guess."</p>
<p>"Apparently not," Mike agreed. "So, in the meantime, I'd be careful that she doesn't catch you two, like I just did," he winked. "She might REALLY flip."</p>
<p>"Good advice, Mike," Sam sighed. She knew her mother all too well. "Good advice."</p>
