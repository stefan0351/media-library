<!-- High School Hell \ Ugly Truth -->

<p>Brooke walked into the Novac a week later and walked directly into Becky Wright. </p>
<p>"Hey, Brooke," Becky greeted her with false sweetness. "How's Sam?" Brooke rolled her eyes. God she hated this girl. Especially since her boyfriend was until recently Pierce Shepard, Sam's attacker. </p>
<p>"Hi, Becky. She's fine, recovering well, transferred to rehab. Thanks for asking," she said as she passed by. Becky moved to block her path.</p>
<p>"I'm real sorry about what Pierce did, I mean, talk about horrid," Becky confessed although Brooke wasn't buying it. </p>
<p>"Whatever," Brooke sighed. Becky tilted her head.</p>
<p>"Can I ask you something?" Brooke rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"I don't suppose my saying `no' would stop you?" she said snarkily. </p>
<p>"You pity Sam don't you? Especially after the accident last spring." Becky asked snottily. Brooke glared. (Guess not) </p>
<p>"Never. I would never pity Sam. And I didn't pity her after the accident either." </p>
<p>"Even though she was hurt instead of you. There was no guilt that it was her in that chair and not you? No pity for the poor girl in the wheelchair?" </p>
<p>"No," Brooke snapped angry that she'd been dragged into this conversation. "There was no `pity for the girl in the wheelchair'," she repeated. </p>
<p>"Isn't that how your relationship started? You took pity and felt guilty so you took care of her and then it was something to get attention with?" Brooke's face turned red with anger. </p>
<p>"You're a real ass, you know that?" she shouted. Becky smiled evily. </p>
<p>"You didn't answer me," she taunted. </p>
<p>"No, that's not how it started! Our relationship, first off,
is none of your God damn business but since you seem intent on making it a punchline in some sick joke, let me set you straight. I love her, I never pitied her and while I did feel guilty that she was hurt instead of me, I thank her everyday for what she did, maybe not in words but she knows how I feel. There is no guilt trip involved. And I do not stay with her for the attention being gay gets me. It's not the kind of attention you want, Beck. There's attention, and then there's this, what you're doing to the two of us, what Pierce did to Sam and that's just plain sick." </p>
<p>"So, you're not using her to get attention? What about now that she's in the chair again?" </p>
<p>"No, I told you this is not a ploy to get attention. And I don't care about her being in that chair. You know what? This discussion is over," Brooke pushed passed Becky angrily and stormed out of the room. Becky let her go and smiled to herself. </p>
<p>"That's OK, Brooke, I got what I wanted," she said as she pulled a small recording device out of her purse and turned it off with a devilish smirk. </p>

<p>"Heya, Sam, this arrived for you, no note though," Nurse Tom Chesterfield said as he handed Sam a small wrapped bundle. Sam frowned and took the package from him. </p>
<p>"Thanks," she said. (Brooke didn't say she was sending anything) </p>
<p>"Lights out in ten, Sam," Tom reminded her as he left the room. She nodded and unwrapped the package to find a small tape recorder with a note that said `Play Me' on it in unfamiliar handwritting. Shrugging Sam pressed play on the device and listened to what was obviously Brooke's voice. And wished when it was over that Nicole had finished the job she started last fall. </p>
<p>"I don't love her, I pity her. This started as a guilt trip and then it got me the attention I wanted. This is just a ploy to get attention. Pity the girl in the wheelchair. God damn, it's a punchline in some sick joke. I stay with her for the attention being gay gets me. I don't care about her, that's just plain sick." </p>
<p>Sam snapped the device off, leaned over the bed and vomited. Alone in her hospital room, again paralyzed from the waist down, already frightened and feeling alone and now hearing that that the person to whom she gave her heart and soul didn't really love her, she let out a cry of complete and utter despair and heartache that was heard three floors away and brought several nurses running. No one who heard that cry of devastation from within a young girls' soul was able to sleep that night, haunted as they were by that sound. </p>

<p>Brooke arrived early the next morning at the rehab facility eager to see Sam. When she got to Sam's room, she found Sam curled up in bed looking awful. The brunette turned to her with burning eyes, full of tears and then looked away. Brooke frowned. </p>
<p>"What's wrong, Sammy?" Brooke asked, concerned.</p>
<p>"Nothing, go away," Sam snapped. She could still hear Brooke's voice on the tape and having Brooke right there acting all concerned and loving was killing her. </p>
<p>"Go away? Never, come on, Sam. We've been through this before, you heard the doctor, it's a major muscle spasm, there's no permanent damage. You're going to be fine," Brooke reassured her, sitting on the bed and reaching out to stroke Sam's face. Sam jerked away from the touch. </p>
<p>"Don't touch me," Sam hissed lowly. Brooke snatched her hand away in surprise. </p>
<p>"Why, Sammy? What's wrong?" Brooke asked, getting worried.</p>
<p>"Go away, I don't want you here. I'm not going through this again," Sam spat at Brooke angrily from her hospital bed. Brooke just stared at her blankly. Sam's face turned red. "I said GET OUT! I don't want you here. Get out of my life. I don't want your pity!" </p>
<p>"My pity? The only reason I'd pity you is because you're being an unreasonable ass," Brooke shot back. Sam eyes grew dark and stormy.</p>
<p>"Maybe you missed it because I went too fast for your blonde, cheerleader brain to keep up, but GET-OUT-OF-MY-LIFE!" she screamed. Brooke bolted up off the bed in surprise of the amount of anger and venom coming at her from Sam. Sam actually sounded like she hated her. </p>
<p>"Sam, what is the matter with you?" she asked, hurt.</p>
<p>"I finally get it Brooke, you never loved me, you pitied me. That's all it was. `Feel sorry for the girl in the wheelchair'. Then you stayed with me when I was out of the chair because it was something new and chic and got you the attention you craved. Well, now I'm in the chair again and I don't want your damn pity and I sure as Hell don't want you!" Sam ranted. Brooke blinked away tears. </p>
<p>"Sammy, how can you say that?" she choked. </p>
<p>"I'm not going to let you hurt me!" Sam shouted in tears.</p>
<p>"Sammy, I would never?" Brooke started. </p>
<p>"Get out," Sam repeated. </p>
<p>"Sam?" Brooke begged. She was so confused. (Where was this coming from?) </p>
<p>"Get?out?" Sam growled, tears now gone and relaced with a look of pure hatred that actually scared Brooke. </p>
<p>"Sa?" </p>
<p>"GETOUTGETOUTGETOUTGETOUTGETOUTGETOUT!" Brooke stumbled backwards away from the bed so quickly she tripped and nearly fell, finally making it to the door. With one last mournful glance at the enraged figure lying in the bed, she hastily opened the door and left, hearing the click of the door behind her like it was slamming on the doorway of her heart. </p>
