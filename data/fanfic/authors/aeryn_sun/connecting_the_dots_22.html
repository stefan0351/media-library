<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Twenty Two -->

<p>Brooke sat across from Sam at the kitchen table the next morning, watching the quiet brunette try and eat her breakfast. Unfortunately Brooke had hit her a lot harder than either of them had realized and Sam was having trouble eating past the swelling and pain in her lip and cheek. Brooke felt absolutely terrible and was consumed with guilt despite Sam's repeated assurances that she was OK and not mad.</p>
<p>Brooke still couldn't believe that she'd lost control of her temper like that. She had lashed out and hurt the one person who had continuously been on her side since she'd awoken from her coma. The one person that she could count on to be there for her through anything.</p>
<p>(God, I just keep hurting her, over and over) Brooke cried silently to herself.</p>
<p>"Stop dwelling, Brooke. I'm fine," Sam spoke so suddenly that Brooke jumped. She met Sam's friendly gaze over the table, trying not to look at the swollen purple lip or the visible palm print on the side of Sam's face. It twisted her heart to know that she'd caused the person she loved more than her own life such pain, however accidentally.</p>
<p>(My anger did that. I should have listened to the doctor and done something sooner. If I hadn't been so damn stubborn, it never would have happened)</p>
<p>"Brooke," Sam called softly when she noticed the blonde's attention wandering again. She felt bad that Brooke felt so horrible but on the other hand she hoped that it was what Brooke needed to see that she required help in dealing with her anger issues.</p>
<p>"Hmmm?" Brooke said, trying to draw her attention back to the external instead of the internal.</p>
<p>"Look at me, honey," Sam said, her voice silky and smooth. Brooke reluctantly looked up from her Cookie Crisps to Sam's wounded face and cringed.</p>
<p>"Brooke, I will heal," Sam pointed out. "Let it go. I have."</p>
<p>"But Sam?" Brooke started to complain. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, Brooke. Don't. It's over, you didn't mean it. When you look at the bruise, try to remember what caused it and make sure that you don't let it happen again, OK?" Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"OK. You know, Sam, you're way too good to me," she said quietly. Sam frowned.</p>
<p>"Why do you say that?" Sam asked confused. Brooke shrugged one shoulder and stared back into her soggy cereal.</p>
<p>"You know the saying, Sammy. `If they hit you once, they'll hit you again' or some sort," Brooke said sadly.</p>
<p>"So you're planning on whapping me again?" Sam asked with her eyebrows raised but not really serious. Brooke scowled.</p>
<p>"Sam," she said irritated. "No, I will never hit you again. I told you that. But the meaning behind the saying is that no matter what the abuser says, no matter how much they promise that it'll never happen again, it always does."</p>
<p>"Brooke, you're not a wife-beater," Sam said calmly. "As a person or an undershirt," she smirked.</p>
<p>"Damn it, I'm trying to be serious here," Brooke snapped. She then realized that she was getting angry again and took a deep breath. She looked into Sam's deep brown eyes and saw only love and concern there, no anger or condemnation. It soothed her nerves a bit.</p>
<p>"Sam, I say that I won't hit you and I mean it when I say it but?"</p>
<p>"And you won't. I believe that," Sam said determined. "I have no doubt about it. Brooke, look, you were beyond angry. I said some mean things, you said some mean things and it just got beyond our control. Shit happens. You have some issues that we need to deal with that factored into the situation, hon. If we deal with those, it will NOT happen again."</p>
<p>"You really believe that?" Brooke asked hopefully. She was so afraid that she'd hurt Sam again someday that it was making her physically ill. Sam smiled widely and nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes, with all my heart, love," Sam reassured her. Brooke smiled back at Sam. She felt immediately better because of Sam's reassurance and by the fact that Sam had said `we deal' meaning that she wasn't abandoning her. Sam was going to stick by her side like she had all along despite what Brooke had done to her.</p>
<p>"Just so you know, Sammy, if I ever break my word about that, I will leave you," Brooke said quietly. Sam arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Just so you know, Brooke, if you ever break your word about that, I will show you the door."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Explaining the bruise to other people was surprisingly simple, especially since thankfully the palm print had merged into one big red blotch. Since no one would ever suspect Brooke of hitting Sam, especially given how close they'd gotten recently, the story they wove about Brooke opening the car door into Sam's face seemed to pacify everyone. It also went a long way as to explain the guilty expression that Brooke was wearing.</p>
<p>"I still think you needed stitches," Brooke sighed. Sam shrugged.</p>
<p>"Too late now," she smirked and then winced. "Ow."</p>
<p>"And what do we say to Mom and Dad?" Brooke worried. Sam rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"The same thing we've said to everyone else, Brooke. Stop worrying so much," she advised. </p>
<p>They were standing in front of their lockers having the same discussion they'd had on the way to school and Sam found it tiring. She had honestly already forgiven Brooke for what had happened, chalking it up to an anomaly that would not occur again. She hated that Brooke was dwelling.</p>
<p>"I hear someone finally gave you what you deserve, bitch," Harrison hissed as he walked up to the two girls. Sam spun around to face him as Brooke frowned.</p>
<p>"What's your damage, Harrison?" Sam snapped. Harrison smiled a nasty smile, obviously happy to see the injury done to Sam's face.</p>
<p>"Your lip. I'm glad to see someone finally gave you a taste of what you deserve," he clarified.</p>
<p>"Go away, Harrison," Brooke asked, trying to get rid of the pest before he could set her or Sam off.</p>
<p>"I walked into the car door as Brooke was opening it the other day, you twit," Sam explained. "No one hit me." Harrison snickered.</p>
<p>"Yeah, right. Someone should hit you for what you've done," he informed her angrily. Sam crossed her arms and regarded him carefully.</p>
<p>"And what exactly is it that I've done, Harrison? Other than put up with your bullshit for way too long, you baby," she sneered.</p>
<p>"You know exactly what I mean," Harrison shot back. Sam and Brooke exchanged confused looks.</p>
<p>"No, I don't. Please explain it for those of us that don't speak Harrison-ese," Sam requested. She really had no idea what he was implying other than a vague hint. He was acting way off base and it was throwing her off. Harrison leaned in closer to the two girls.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Sam," he growled. "Are you happy now that you get to mold Brooke into whatever YOU want?" The hackles on the back of Sam's neck stood up and her scalp tingled as the implication of that statement sunk in.</p>
<p>"Shut up, Harrison. It's not like that," she said defensively as behind her Brooke felt like someone kicked her in the ribs. She knew why Sam had said that but it still hurt.</p>
<p>"Oh really?" Harrison challenged. "You don't think I've been watching the two of you? I've noticed the way you look at her, Sam. Please, you're not exactly subtle."</p>
<p>"I have NO idea what you're talking about," Sam snapped trying to diffuse him and keep their secret. The last person aside from Nicole that she wanted to know about her and Brooke was Harrison.</p>
<p>"Give up the innocent act, McPherson! You've been in love with Brooke since the second fucking grade! That accident was the best thing that could have happened for you. Now you get to contort her to fit your twisted and warped wants and desires. And to Hell with who she really is!" Unable to listen to anymore and desperate to stop his ranting, Sam slapped him across the face. To her surprise and Brooke's, he slapped her back re-injuring her lip.</p>
<p>"Harrison!" Brooke hissed. "Have you completely flipped your lid?" She gingerly checked Sam's bleeding lip. Now she was sure she needed to take Sam to have it looked at.</p>
<p>"You make me sick, Sam. Look what you've done to her. That's not Brooke," Harrison claimed. </p>
<p>"My mind is my own, Harrison. I thought we were clear on that," Brooke said. "And I am Brooke. Or at least who she is now. You need to get used to that."</p>
<p>"She did this to you, Brooke. You're not like that," he said, his voice softening as he spoke to her. Brooke frowned.</p>
<p>"Like what, Harrison?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Gay," he whispered like it was a bad word, contaminating him to say it.</p>
<p>"I heard your Mom is," she shot back as Sam stayed quiet. Her silence was bothering Brooke. The blonde could feel the storm brewing inside her brunette lover and knew the danger level was approaching. She had to get them both away from Harrison fast. Harrison scowled.</p>
<p>"That's different," he decided. "And not my point. Sam's twisted you to think you're something you're not. I've seen it, Brooke. The way she looks at you, how she touches you?" Brooke watched as Harrison paled as he spoke. "It's not you, the real you."</p>
<p>"Are you stalking us?" Brooke asked suddenly making Harrison jump.</p>
<p>"N?no?I've seen it at school. I saw that little `scene' in psych class a while back. Brooke, don't let her do this to you. You don't need her." He was almost begging and Brooke found it both sad and annoying.</p>
<p>"You know, I don't know what your problem is, really, Harrison. But back off. You don't run my life, I do. I make my decisions based on what I want. Not what you want, or what Sammy wants, but what I want. I am acutely aware of my decisions. So, you've worn out your welcome, Harrison. Please leave."</p>
<p>"You're going to side with her?" Harrison asked, pointing at Sam and looking dejected. "She's brainwashing you, into what I don't know but it's wrong, Brooke. You have to stop her."</p>
<p>"Harrison, I'll say this one more time. No one makes my choices for me but me. Sam is not brainwashing me into anything. She is not some evil, diabolical thing turning me into something I'm not. Aside from that, I'm not saying anymore. LEAVE." Harrison's eyes narrowed as he stared at both girls for several long seconds. Finally he focused his intense gaze solely on Sam.</p>
<p>"I WILL get you for this. I swear."</p>
