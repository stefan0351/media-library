<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Forty -->

<p>And so, as quickly as it began, it ended. School was over, Harrison had been sent away, Nicole was declawed and Brooke and Sam were left to themselves for the summer. Brooke's memory was almost back in place, not that it mattered to either girl, and they had each other. Anything else was just gravy.</p>
<p>Sam watched as a frown creased Brooke's brow as she thought. Something else was obviously on the blonde's mind and it was troubling her. Not wanting to push, Sam sat quietly watching the TV with her arms around Brooke, patiently waiting for the other girl to work through whatever it was. She knew Brooke would talk to her when she was ready.</p>
<p>"What happens now, Sammy?" Brooke finally broke the silence with her whispered question. Sam ran her hands through Brooke's soft blonde hair.</p>
<p>"We go on. See what happens next," she answered quietly. Brooke twisted so that she could look Sam in the eyes.</p>
<p>"That's just IT, Sam. What's going to happen next?" she sounded almost frightened to Sam. Sam gave her a small smile.</p>
<p>"I don't know, love. I can't predict the future," she confessed. "What I do know for now is, God willing that we pass ALL our finals, we graduate. After that," she shrugged. "Who knows?" Brooke didn't seem satisfied with that answer.</p>
<p>"But college?we're both going?" she started and stopped, looking confused. "Right?"</p>
<p>"Memory hiccup," Sam smirked while Brooke nodded and blushed.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I hate it," she sighed. Sam kissed the end of her nose.</p>
<p>"UCLA, hon," Sam filled in the blank. "Yes, we're both going. But, Brooke, that's months away. You can't worry about that right now. If I've learned one thing from your accident, it's to live in the present; the here and now. This moment, Brooke, it's the one that matters. What's in the past we can't do anything to change. And what's to come, we can't predict. If we spend all our time regretting our mistakes and worrying about tomorrow, we miss out on today. Learn from yesterday. Live for today. Hope for tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Wow, Sammy," Brooke breathed after a moment of silence. "You should be writer."</p>
<p>"Oh, ha ha. You're funny," Sam scoffed. "That was my deep thought for the year so savor it." Brooke laughed.</p>
<p>"I am, Sammy. You just seriously reminded me of a Hallmark card. I love the sentiment but if the `investigative journalist' thing doesn't work out, you have another option to fall back on."</p>
<p>"GRRRR?" Sam mock glowered at her girlfriend. Brooke quickly tried to backtrack.</p>
<p>"And you're right, of course. I'm just worried is all," she confided. Sam hugged her tighter.</p>
<p>"About what?" she asked. Brooke stared at her for a second, her vulnerability laid open for Sam to see. She then looked away.</p>
<p>"Of losing you," she said, hardly audible over the TV. Sam used her fingers to tilt Brooke's face back up.</p>
<p>"I can't promise that it'll always be easy, Brooke. These past few months should have taught you that much. All I can promise is, I love you. Every bit of me loves everything that you are. That's all I have to give to you." Tears raced down Brooke's face.</p>
<p>"It's enough Sam. And I love you too."</p>
