<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Consolation Prizes -->

<p>The air in the atrium was moist and fragrant, filling Lily with a sense a
warmth and well-being.  She loved just sitting in the plant filled room while
she read or did her homework.  She truly felt at peace as the sun streaked in
and bathed the room in its glow.  Triscuit sat nearby purring as she played with
a combative fern.</p>
<p>"Triscuit," Lily scolded gently. "Don't you wound that plant." Triscuit took
a swing at a green leaf and yowled when it lightly smacked her in the face on
return.</p>
<p>"Tsk, such language kitty," Lily laughed, picking the cat up and placing her
on top of her English book.  She purred loudly and reached up to bump noses with
Lily before jumping down to chase patterns on the tile floor.  Lily smiled.</p>
<p>She looked back up at the large room surrounding her, and it suddenly hit
her.  This was HER house.  She could do what she wanted, when she wanted and
didn't have to answer to anyone.  She didn't have a curfew, a bedtime, a phone
limit; there were no restrictions on anything.  If she wanted to eat breakfast
for dinner or vice versa, she could.  No one was there to tell her `no'.  Even
Nicole let her do her own thing.  Yes, they were lovers, partners and deeply in
love but Nicole made no move to control her.</p>
<p>Lily's smile widened.</p>
<p>"Wow." she breathed as she realized that her life was her own.  She'd taken
control of it away from her mother and never looked back.  She was suddenly
filled with a sense of pride and independence.</p>
<p>Of course, if you'd told her a year ago that she'd be where she was at the
moment; in a huge mansion that was HERS and not working as a member of the help,
in love with and engaged to Nicole Julian of all people, and building a life for
herself, she would have laughed, called you crazy and then slapped you silly.</p>
<p>A year ago, she thought she was in love with Sam.</p>
<p>`The line between love and lust is definitely a blurry one,' Lily thought to
herself.  `I love Nicole but I definitely lusted after Sam to start.'</p>
<p>It was her dreams and fantasies of being with Sam that had catapulted the
four of them on the journey that they were now on.  But when she'd `lost' to
Brooke and after she first kissed Nicole, he lust for Sam had started to fade.
That first kiss with the petite blonde lit some sort of low slow fire inside her
that continued to grow until it overshadowed everything else.  There was no
doubt in her mind about how she felt about Nicole.  She could see her days and
nights, her future each time she looked into Nicole's sky blue eyes.</p>
<p>It had been a much more carnal thing she'd had for Sam.  Sure, there was that
aspect with Nicole, and they had terrific awesome sex but some nights they just
held each other and talked or watched TV.  It didn't always have to be about the
frantic need to consume each other.  And Lily treasured that, the deeper
understanding and connection with Nicole. She understood now that it was
something she never would have had or shared with Sam.</p>
<p>Her heart fluttered with happiness and contentment when she sensed a familiar
presence behind her.</p>
<p>"How long have you been standing there?" she asked, leaning her head back and
throwing Nicole a loving smile.  Nicole walked over and wrapped her arms around
her lover's shoulders, cuddling her.</p>
<p>"A while.  But you seemed to be deep in thought and I didn't want to disturb
that," she explained after sharing a thorough kiss.  "So, solve all the world's
problems yet?"</p>
<p>"No, world hunger is still giving me problems," Lily joked.</p>
<p>"Ah that one is a toughy," Nic chuckled. "Seriously, hon, it looked pretty
important.  Is there anything on your mind?"</p>
<p>"No, not really.  I was just thinking about how things played out," Lily
started to explain. "You know, how different my life is now from what I expected
it to be and where I expected to be.  It just seems so strange sometimes." She
felt Nicole pull away slightly and it confused her.</p>
<p>"Do you...do you regret where you are now?" Nicole asked, a tinge of open
fear and vulnerability seeping into her normally strong voice. "Because I'd
never want you to stay somewhere where you were unhappy or felt unfulfilled.
I'm not about that, Lily.  I love you but I don't own you.  If this isn't where
you want to be, isn't what you want, all you have to do is say so."  Her voice
broke as she finished speaking and the tears she was trying so valiantly to
prevent from falling slid down her face.</p>
<p>Lily bolted out of her chair like a shot and engulfed her upset love in a
tight embrace.</p>
<p>"Oh no, Niki, that's not what I meant," she soothed calmly.  Sometimes the
ideas the blonde got, Lily had NO idea where she pulled them out from. "Not at
all.  Why would you even think that?" she wondered as she wiped away Nicole's
hot tears with the pads of her thumbs.</p>
<p>Nicole hiccuped and shook her head, unable to speak.</p>
<p>"What I meant," Lily pressed on. "Was that I never imagined in a million
years that my life would ever be this wonderful.  Look around you, Nic, this
house is more than I could have ever DREAMED of having.  I'm free from my
mother's influence and oppression.  I'm free to be me, just Lily, without having
to hide or lie about myself or omit certain facts." She kissed Nicole's lightly,
tasting the salt from her lover's fresh tears.</p>
<p>"And then there's you," she whispered. "I have you and I wouldn't give that
up for anything, Nicole.  You make me so unbelievably happy that I wake up
everyday amazed that this is my life.  I go to sleep thankful but afraid that
it's some sort of dream that I'm going to wake from.  Each day with you is a
gift that I treasure.  I love you, Niki."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Nicole sobbed into Lily's arms.  Lily `shhed' her.  It unnerved
her somewhat to see her normally stoic girlfriend reduced so drastically to
tears.</p>
<p>"Don't be, they were valid concerns and I appreciate the freedom you give
me.  But I WANT to be with you," Lily cooed. "Understand?" Nicole nodded against
her.</p>
<p>"Ug, sorry to blubber all over your blouse like that," Nicole sniffled as she
recovered. "How unrefined of me.  Must be that hormonal pre-surge," she
explained to try and wave it off.  Lily arched an eyebrow in challenge.</p>
<p>"All right, fine," Nicole sighed upon seeing the disbelieving look on her
girlfriend's face. "That was shit that's been bothering me for a while now.  I
never want you to feel trapped and I know that I was only a second, no wait,
Hell NINTH choice after you couldn't have Sam."</p>
<p>"Stop." Lily ordered. "Just stop right there."</p>
<p>"Lily, I love you with everything I am but let's not sugar coat shit, OK?  I
am a consolation prize to the Grand Prize: Sam McPherson.  And I'm OK with that
because I love you and you chose me and."</p>
<p>Lily silenced Nicole's ranting with a smoldering kiss.</p>
<p>"Let's get something straight, Julian," she said lowly, huskily as she
pressed her forehead against Nicole's. "You are NOT a `second choice', a
`consolation prize', or anything of the sort.  I realize now that what I felt
for Sam was lust; pure and simple.  I wanted in her pants, yes.  But it wasn't
love.  I love you, Nicole."</p>
<p>"I just never want you to regret." Nicole started.</p>
<p>"I don't," Lily interrupted, stressing the last word as strongly as she
could. "So just forget about Sam and how we ended up where we're at.  Things
worked out the way they were supposed to.  You and I were supposed to be, not me
and Sam.  Brooke and Sam have proved that much if nothing else.  Those two are a
matched set, same as you and I are."</p>
<p>"Peanut butter and jelly?" Nicole laughed through a watery smile.  Lily
nodded.</p>
<p>"Salt and pepper, sweety," she agreed.</p>
<p>"Ham and cheese?"</p>
<p>"No meat but, ketchup and mustard, yes," Lily smiled.</p>
<p>"OK, now I'm getting hungry."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke held back Sam's hair as another wave of nausea bent the brunette girl
over the toilet gasping.  She rubbed Sam's back and talked soothingly to her as
the smaller girl's body shook and heaved, tears streaming down both their faces.</p>
<p>"Oh Sammy, what will it take for you to see the Dr?" Brooke asked quietly as
Sam collapsed into her arms exhausted. "You can't sleep, you can't hold food
down, you're miserable, honey and I'm worried."</p>
<p>"Make the room stop spinning and I'll think about it," Sam groaned weakly.
Brooke's eyebrows leapt up in alarm.</p>
<p>"You're dizzy now, too?" she asked, her concern growing.  Sam nodded briefly
and then groaned at the action as it caused the room to spin faster.  Brooke
kissed her forehead.</p>
<p>"You're not feverish," she pointed out. "How long have you been having dizzy
spells?" Sam shrugged one shoulder as she kept her eyes closed against the
spinning.</p>
<p>"Off and on for awhile," she confessed. "I thought maybe it was a sinus thing
and it would go away but it's only getting worse." Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"You must be feeling really bad to admit that much," she realized.  Sam was
usually obnoxiously tightlipped about how she felt when she was hurt or sick.
"Come on, let's get you cleaned up and take you to the Dr."</p>
<p>"Brooke, I doubt I can even stand. Please just put me back to bed and let me
try to sleep," Sam whined.  Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, not this time.  Sam, something serious could be wrong and I don't want
to lose you." Fear and worry had crept into Brooke's voice causing Sam to open
her eyes and see the scared look on her lover's face.  And she lost any
remaining stubbornness right there.</p>
<p>"Fine but, I'm really going to need help.  I'm so dizzy, Brooke," she
whispered.</p>
<p>"We'll go slow, Sam.  Come on," Brooke said lovingly.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke wondered, idly as she sat in the walk-in center's waiting room, if the
hospital staff purposely kept the waiting rooms filled with magazine's older
than herself just to annoy and bore her.</p>
<p>`Oh look, according to People, Brad Pitt and Gwenyth are planning on getting
married.  Good God!' She threw the magazine down with a huff and started to sulk
at being made to wait while the doctors looked at Sam just as Nicole and Lily
walked in.</p>
<p>"Cheer up, B, we bring Krispy Kreme's and espresso," Nic declared setting
down the offered items.</p>
<p>"And recent copies of Vanity Fair, Vogue, and Fashion Weekly," Lily piped up
handing Brooke the magazines. "She still in there?" Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"Two hours...what do they need to do that takes TWO FREAKING HOURS?" Brooke
ranted.</p>
<p>"B, calm down," Nicole said calmly. "If she was REALLY sick, they would have
come and gotten you by now.  Have you called Jane?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, she's still in Texas with Aunt Terri.  She was going to come back but
I told her to hold off and I'd call when we knew what was wrong.  She's having
such a great time I'd hate to ruin it if it really is just a sinus infection."</p>
<p>"I'm sure Spam's fine.  She's just being overly dramatic," Nicole said with a
wink to try and lighten Brooke's mood.</p>
<p>"Brooke McQueen?" a nurse stood at the entryway and announced Brooke's name.
Brooke stood up and walked over.</p>
<p>"That's me.  Is Sam all right?" The nurse nodded.</p>
<p>"She's fine and can go home in a little while.  The doctor would like to talk
to her parents, however." Brooke bit her lip.</p>
<p>"Her mother is in Texas.  I'm kinda all the rest of the family," she
explained, suddenly worried that they wouldn't tell her what was wrong with Sam
because she wasn't technically family.  The nurse looked at her for a moment and
then nodded, apparently seeing something in Brooke's expression.</p>
<p>"OK, I'll take you to her room then." She started to lead Brooke away.</p>
<p>"We'll be here when you two come back!" Nicole called after her.  Brooke sent
her a smile and mouthed `thank you' as the door closed behind her.</p>
<p>"So, Sam's OK, right?  She's going to be fine, right?" Brooke babbled to the
nurse who nodded.</p>
<p>"As long as she follows the doctor's orders, she should be fine.  Ah, here
she is, resting comfortably," she ushered Brooke into Sam's room.  The first
thing that struck Brooke was how small Sam suddenly looked in the large hospital
bed.  She was pale and had dark circles under her eyes that were highlighted by
the unflattering florescent lights of the room.</p>
<p>"The doctor will be in shortly," the nurse said on her way out.</p>
<p>"Thanks," Brooke mumbled as she sat next to an apparently sleeping Sam. "Hey
Sammy," she whispered.  Sam's eyes fluttered open and she smiled at her blonde.</p>
<p>"Hey," she said drowsily.  "Hey, don't look so scared, Brooke.  I'm fine,"
she said quickly upon seeing the worried and frightened look on Brooke's face.</p>
<p>"They've had you in here for over two hours, Sammy.  No one would tell me
anything and then I was afraid that they wouldn't let me in because I'm not
really family and and...I'm scared," Brooke finished in a whisper, tears falling
unchecked down her face.</p>
<p>"Hey, they gave me a CAT scan and stuff.  Good news, I have a brain," Sam
joked getting a weak smile from Brooke.</p>
<p>"And it's functional," the doctor announced as he entered the room.  He
pulled up a chair and looked at Sam and Brooke.</p>
<p>"Well, I have your test results and it's nothing dire so you can both relax.
Sam, I have your medical records from the hospital in Texas and it says you
broke your cheekbone?" Sam winced</p>
<p>"Yeah, I uh...got hit," she hedged.  The doctor nodded, not noticing the way
Brooke paled at the memory of her own father striking Sam hard enough to shatter
bone.</p>
<p>"Well, it appears that that fracture caused some damage to your sinuses on
that side which in turn created a fluid backup in your inner ear.  The reason
you can't keep your balance or eat and that falling feeling you get when you lay
down to sleep are all caused by the fluid buildup and some minor nerve damage."</p>
<p>"But she's going to be fine, right?" Brooke prompted him.  The doctor nodded.</p>
<p>"With rest, medication, and time, yes, she'll be fine.  I'm going to write
out a few scripts and the nurse will be in to give you your instructions.
Beyond that, you are free to go." He stood up to leave but then threw one last
look at Sam. "Although next time, you may not be so lucky and there could be
something seriously wrong, Sam.  Don't wait so long to go to the doctor.  We're
not ALL quacks and we don't bite...usually."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Doctor," Brooke said.  She then turned to Sam. "Told you." Sam
stuck her tongue out.</p>
<p>"Know-it-all," she retorted.  Brooke reached out and ruffled Sam's hair.</p>
<p>"Seriously, Sammy, why are you so stubborn?" she asked.  Sam turned away with
a shrug and Brooke saw the emotional walls come crashing down.</p>
<p>"I just am," Sam sighed.</p>
<p>"Sam...I...I don't mean to push I just...I love you and I worry and." Brooke
broke off and stared out the window passed Sam.  She really didn't know what to
say.</p>
<p>"I'm scared...I'm scared that one day it'll be like it was with my Dad and it
won't be something simple.  That the doctor will come in and tell me that I'm
dying and then, that's it, my number's up.  And I don't want to know that.  I
can't handle that," Sam finally said softly a few minutes later.</p>
<p>"How is not knowing any better, honey?" Brooke asked softly.</p>
<p>"Knowing didn't save my Dad now, did it?" Sam asked bitterly. And it suddenly
made a sort of sense to Brooke.  Sam hated doctors because they'd failed to save
one of the two most important people in her young life.  It was no wonder she'd
want to avoid them as much as humanly possible.</p>
<p>"Sam, I can't pretend to understand how you feel, but letting yourself go on
being sick because of what happened to your father isn't a solution either,"
Brooke said evenly. "How do you think it makes me feel to watch you suffer and
have to fight with you to get you to get help?"</p>
<p>Sam shrugged but didn't answer.</p>
<p>"Why does everything have to be a fight with you, Sam?  I'm only trying to
help," her tone had turned defeated, lonely.</p>
<p>"You DO help.  And I don't fight.  I don't mean to be difficult, honest.  I
just....some things are hard for me, Brooke." Brooke picked up Sam's hand and
gave it a squeeze as she lightly stroked the back with her thumb.</p>
<p>"I know, and you wouldn't be Sam otherwise.  But sometimes I just want to
scream you drive me so nuts sometimes," Brooke smiled.</p>
<p>"Yeah well, we wouldn't be `Sam and Brooke' if we didn't drive each other a
little batty now and then," Sam smirked.</p>
<p>"Sam...please, just promise me you won't wait so long before you see a doctor
next time.  I understand what you were saying but, the earlier you know, the
better care you can get.  And besides, together I think we can get through just
about anything." Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"I'll try."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam slept on the ride back to Nicole's thanks to the medication the doctor
had given her.  Brooke had gasped when she'd seen the list of prescriptions;
stuff for nausea and vomiting, stuff for the dizziness, drops for her ears,
antibiotics for the infection and painkillers to top it all off.  Sam had joked
about opening her own pharmacy after they'd picked them all up from Mrs. John's
store.</p>
<p>She'd gotten Sam back to the Villa and then up to their room where she tucked
her in lovingly.</p>
<p>Nicole and Lily stopped on the way home and got the two all sorts of
previsions; snacks, movies, magazines, anything they could think of.  Lily
called Jane and filled her in, taking that added pressure off of Brooke.</p>
<p>The tall lanky blonde slid into the bed behind Sam, spooning against her back
and wrapping her arm around Sam's waist as `Blue Crush' played on the DVD
player.</p>
<p>"I'll take good care of you, Sammy," she whispered.  Sam snuggled into the
embrace.</p>
<p>"I know you will," Sam mumbled sleepily.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry that my father seems to keep causing you pain," Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"Not your fault, Brooke," Sam yawned. "This is just one of those things."</p>
<p>Brooke shook her head silently.  Sometimes she couldn't understand how Sam
could be so forgiving of a monster like Mike McQueen.  Especially given how
violent and unstable he'd become recently.</p>
<p>She leaned up and lightly kissed Sam's ear.</p>
<p>"Night Sam, feel better."</p>
<p>"Night Brooke."</p>
