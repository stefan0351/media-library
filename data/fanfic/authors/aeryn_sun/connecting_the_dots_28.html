<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Twenty Eight -->

<p>"Brooke, what's bothering you?" Sam asked quietly late one night a few days after she had woken to find Brooke curled up beside her unexpectedly. Brooke looked up from her bed to Sam standing in the doorway and then rolled onto her side, her back to Sam.</p>
<p>"Nothing, Sam. Go back to bed," she sighed. Sam approached the bed.</p>
<p>"I'll just wake up to find you there. I'll save you the trouble," she said, crawling into the bed beside Brooke. She stroked the blonde's back as she refused to roll over to face her.</p>
<p>"Talk to me, Brooke, tell me what's going on. Don't shut me out, please. Don't let what happened happen again," she begged. Brooke rolled over suddenly, her face a study in shock.</p>
<p>"Sammy, are you afraid I'll hurt you again?" she asked hushed. Sam closed her eyes as a few tears leaked past her eyelids.</p>
<p>"I know you don't want to but I see the anger there again, Brooke. I see the fear," she explained, opening her eyes and looking into Brooke's hazel ones. "Something's going on with you and you won't let me help. Please, let me in, Brooke." Brooke leaned over and kissed the now red outline of the small scar on Sam's lip. Her stitches had been removed and it was going to leave a small reminder. Now that Brooke thought about it, maybe the scar was a good thing. Not that she wanted Sam marred, but it would serve to make sure she kept control of herself in the future and never hurt Sam or anyone else that way again.</p>
<p>"Oh Sammy," she said softly. "I want your help but?" she fell silent.</p>
<p>"But what?" Sam prompted gently when Brooke's silence stretched for a few minutes. </p>
<p>"I'm confused, Sam. I don't know what's going on. I'm starting to remember things and it's leaving me all discombobulated," she started to explain.</p>
<p>"Wait, you're remembering things? Brooke, that's great!" Sam exclaimed. "Isn't it?" Worry had crept into Sam's voice and oddly it warmed Brooke's heart. She knew Sam was worried that with the return of her memories, despite the proof of long-standing feelings for the brunette, that their relationship would come to a screeching halt. She reached out and stroked Sam's cheek.</p>
<p>"I guess it's a good thing from a healing standpoint. I guess I'm not permanently brain damaged," she tried to joke. "But I'm scared, Sammy. I've told you why. I can't seem to shake that fear no matter what you or Natalie says. I like who I am now and have no desire to go back to being who I once was." She went on to explain her first memory flash that day in the bedroom when Sam found her passed out on the floor and the dreams since then. When she was done, Sam looked thoughtful for a few moments and then nodded.</p>
<p>"I can't say I understand, Brooke, because I honestly don't. And I won't belittle your trouble or fear by saying that I do. That's not fair to you. But please know that I'm right here for you any time that you need me. You need only ask," Sam assured her. Brooke wrapped her arms around Sam and hugged her tight.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Sammy. I feel better already. Can you do me one favor?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Anything."</p>
<p>"Please don't tell anyone, not even Mom and Dad, that my memories have started to return? I don't want to get their hopes up if it's just a fluke thing and nothing more is going to come back. You know how they've been about the whole thing and I don't think I could handle it if they got anymore overbearing," she said around a yawn. She was emotionally drained and it was starting to catch up with her. </p>
<p>"Of course. I promise, Brooke. My lips are sealed," Sam vowed. She kissed Brooke lightly on the lips as the lanky former cheerleader started to drift off to sleep. "I love you."</p>
<p>"Love you too, Sammy," Brooke mumbled before sleep claimed her. Still caught in Brooke's strong embrace, Sam followed her into slumber a short time later.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke couldn't believe this was happening. Thanks to the terrible threesome, Sam's school life was quickly becoming a living hell. Granted, a lot of the school's population didn't really care what her sexual orientation was. It was, after all, a new millennium. A small percentage of the populace did resort to calling her slurs like 'dyke' and 'fag' in the hallways instead of her name, but for the most part, Sam ignored them. She'd spent so long learning how to ignore what people thought anyway that it was nothing new. But aside from the division over her sexuality, most of the school was convinced, (thanks in part to the colorful storytelling of Nicole, Mary Cherry, and most notably Harrison) that Sam had somehow taken advantage of a disadvantaged Brooke. It was over that issue that Sam was receiving the most harassment.</p>
<p>She was harassed endlessly in class, in the halls, in the lunchroom. There was rarely a moment on campus when she wasn't in some way ridiculed or shunned for her behavior. Despite Brooke's insistence to anyone who would listen that she was the one who instigated the relationship, no one would believe her. They still viewed her as 'brain damaged.' It annoyed her to no end. As the next two weeks wore on, Sam started missing school, having trouble even bringing herself to get out of bed to go. Some took her reluctance to face the masses as an admission of guilt but Brooke knew it for what it was, depression. Sam was hurt and angry by everyone's reactions and everything she feared would happen was apparently happening.</p>
<p>Friday morning, Brooke walked into Sam's room and found her brunette lover still wrapped up under the covers, nowhere near ready for school. She cautiously approached the bed and poked at the bundle under the blankets.</p>
<p>"Playing hooky again today, Sammy?" she asked quietly. Her response was a muffled growl. She sighed and sat on Sam's bed.</p>
<p>"You can't hide in here forever, Sammy. You're letting them win," she reminded the other girl.</p>
<p>"Let them win. I don't give a fuck anymore," Sam snapped from under the covers. Brooke pulled the blankets away from Sam's head and ran her fingers through the unruly brown hair covering the pillow.</p>
<p>"Sam, You have never let anyone get the better of you. Not me, not Nicole, not anyone. Don't start now," Brooke advised. Sam lifted her head and looked at the lanky blonde beside her.</p>
<p>"Drawing on your own memories for that or things you've heard?" she asked. Brooke smirked.</p>
<p>"A little of both, actually. You've always fought with me for every point you've gained. Or that I've gained for that matter. You NEVER make things easy, never take the easy route. And yet, instead of battling these ignorant ass holes you hide from them. That is NOT the Sam McPherson that I know." Sam looked at her, an incredibly serious look on her face.</p>
<p>"Maybe I'm not her anymore," she said quietly. Brooke scowled at her.</p>
<p>"Don't even start that, Sam. You're just stuck and frustrated right now, well get through this, I swear," Brooke promised. Sam was quiet for a while, just sitting with Brooke on the bed.</p>
<p>"The new M&M should be purple because there should be a gay M&M...voiced by Rosie O'Donnell and it lusts after the Green one," she said suddenly, totally disarming Brooke who burst out laughing.</p>
<p>"WHAT?"</p>
<p>"It should be purple and gay. A lesbian M&M. Think about it, it would promote tolerance in the ad campaigns," Sam said logically but with a large smile.</p>
<p>"But what if the Purple M&M is a man?" Brooke asked with a giggle. Sam thought a minute.</p>
<p>"Then it should be voiced by Harvey Fierstien and lust after the red one voiced by Jon Lovitz," she responded without missing a beat. Brooke had to lay down on the bed to keep from falling off it; she was laughing so hard.</p>
<p>"Nice try at changing the subject, by the way. But that really does nothing to solve your present situation," she wheezed after she recovered. Sam sighed as she wrapped her arms around Brooke.</p>
<p>"No, and I've put entirely too much time into figuring all that out. But admit it, it was funny," she said. Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"That it was. Now come on, get up for school," she pulled on Sam's arms a little but was met with stanch resistance.</p>
<p>"Brooke, really, I'm not up for that fight today," she said defeated. "I can't go through that punishment right now. Just let me have today and the weekend to rest. Please?" The begging tone on Sam's face, complete with pout, was overpowering to Brooke and she had no choice but to relent.</p>
<p>"Fine, Sam. But come Monday, you're going back to school and we're going to set those jerks straight. I love you, it's that simple," Brooke explained. Sam rested her chin on Brooke's shoulder. "But, until then, I think I'll stay here in bed with you."</p>
<p>"I think I'd like that," Sam said softly.</p>
