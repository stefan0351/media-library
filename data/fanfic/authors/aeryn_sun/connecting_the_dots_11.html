<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Eleven -->

<p>Sam sat patiently waiting in the plush lounge of the doctor's
office as Brooke endured yet another exam. She felt sorry for Brooke in a way;
she knew how much Brooke hated the doctor's offices and the endless exams.
Brooke often compared it to being a science experiment run amok. Sam couldn't
blame her and after all this time she was just hoping for some good news. Not
necessarily that Brooke's memory was going to come back but an otherwise clean
bill of health would be nice. </p>
<p>In recent days Brooke had been suffering from debilitating
migraines. Their parents hoped that the headaches were a symptom of her memory
returning but all they did was leave Brooke ornery, tired, and weak. During her
attacks she lay in Sam's bed, the only place she felt comfortable, clinging to
Sam crying desperately. And poor Sam was powerless to help her. So she'd hold
Brooke until the blonde fell asleep, passed out or until the pain eased. It
nearly killed Sam to look into those pain filled hazel eyes and be unable to
help. </p>
<p>Sam looked up from her hideously outdated Highlights magazine
when the door opened and Brooke all but bounced out. </p>
<p>"Ready to go, Sammy?" she chirped, the smile on her face
illuminating the entire room. Sam couldn't stop herself from smiling back. </p>
<p>"Whenever you are," she responded. "Good news I gather?"
Brooke nodded happily. </p>
<p>"No permanent brain damage, according to my scans. My
headaches are likely a temporary thing and they gave me a prescription to help
with them. I'm good to go," she beamed. Sam stood up and headed to the door with
her. </p>
<p>"That's fantastic," she agreed enthusiastically. It was
exactly what she had hoped to hear. "But what about your memory?" Brooke frowned
at the question. </p>
<p>"What about it?" she asked with a shrug. </p>
<p>"Well," Sam started slowly. "Is it going to return or...not?"
Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"No one is really sure," she said. She took a deep breath and
thought a moment. "You know, it doesn't really inspire a hell of a lot of
confidence in the medical profession when your doctor scratches his head, shrugs
and says 'I don't know', now does it?" </p>
<p>"Not really," Sam agreed with a hint of disappointment in her
voice. Brooke stopped and looked over at her as they reached the car.
</p>
<p>"Would it really bother you that much if I never remembered my
past?" she asked quietly. Sam frowned as she thought. </p>
<p>"I guess not. I mean, I'll miss the history we shared, sort
of. But I'm really just glad you're still alive, still here. I can deal with the
rest," she finished happily. Brooke smiled. </p>
<p>"Thanks Sam, that means a lot," she said as they got in the
car. "With everyone else wanting a certain something from me, it's such a relief
that I can just relax and be me, whoever that is today, around you. Really, Sam,
thanks." </p>
<p>"Don't worry about it," Sam said as a slight blush rose to her
cheeks that Brooke found cute. "We're friends and friends are supposed to be
there for each other, right?" </p>
<p>"Right," Brooke nodded. They lapsed into a comfortable silence
for a short while. </p>
<p>"Tell me something, Sam?" Brooke asked quietly as Sam expertly
drove the car through the late day traffic. Sam smiled slightly. </p>
<p>"I thought we covered this," she grinned causing Brooke to
smile back from the passenger seat. "You can ask me anything. But I can still
refuse to answer if I want to." </p>
<p>"OK," Brooke agreed. She was silent as she considered how to
phrase her question carefully. She knew that if she misworded it in the
slightest Sam wouldn't answer her. And Brooke desperately needed some sort of
answer. </p>
<p>"Sam," she started slowly. "Before my accident, how
close...how close were we really?" she finished shyly. Sam frowned as she drove.
Of all the questions she had been expecting, that one was no where on her mental
list. She was expecting more questions about her pathetic lack of a love life
since it seemed to be one of Brooke's favorite subjects. Or maybe a question
about why she had left for San Diego in the first place, but a question about
the very basis of their relationship before the accident knocked Sam for a loop. </p>
<p>"Uh, I dunno. Close, I guess?" she responded more as a
question than an answer. </p>
<p>"Are you telling me or asking me, Sam? Because I don't know,"
Brooke said with a small smirk. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"I don't know either, Brooke. I mean, I guess we were as close
as two former arch enemies forced into tight living quarters could be," Sam
acknowledged still avoiding a direct answer. Brooke sighed. She hated playing
'Butt your head against Sam's stubborn streak until something cracks'. It was
tiring. </p>
<p>"So we were friends?" she prompted. Sam nodded slowly.
</p>
<p>"I suppose so, off and on. Yes, we were. Unfortunately we're
both incredibly strong-willed and stubborn so we used to butt heads a lot," Sam
explained. "We'd call a truce and then one of us would inevitably break it." </p>
<p>"Oh," Brooke said sounding slightly disappointed. Sam heard
the underlying tones of sadness and quickly tried to add something to cheer
Brooke up. </p>
<p>"We had gotten better, especially with Mac being born and all.
We were maturing nicely," she joked making Brooke giggle slightly. "Why the
sudden interest?" </p>
<p>"It's not sudden. I'm trying to understand the dynamics of our
relationship. It seems so complex, Sam. We hated each other for so long and then
we were forced to live together. At some point in time it seems like you went
from being my worst enemy to my best friend and I'm trying to understand why,"
Brooke explained. </p>
<p>"Oh," Sam replied simply. </p>
<p>"I mean, you shoved me out of the way of Nicole's car. You
could have been hurt or even killed, Sam. I want and need to understand why
you'd feel the need to take such a risk," she finished quietly. </p>
<p>"Because I care about you," Sam answered without hesitation.
Brooke frowned at the unexpectedly prompt and honest response. It made her
extremely happy to hear but she was surprised that Sam so readily admitted it. </p>
<p>"You do?" she asked. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Of course I do, despite our past. Brooke, I'd gotten to know
you as a person as opposed to the image you fronted. I hate the 'popular' image
but I genuinely like the person. I didn't and still don't want to see you hurt." </p>
<p>"Thank you," Brooke whispered touched that Sam really cared.
She was quiet again for several minutes before she spoke. </p>
<p>"So, what happened between you, me, and Harrison?" she asked
Sam. Sam let out a heavy sigh. </p>
<p>"We made him chose between you or me. He chose you," Sam said
plainly but without malice. </p>
<p>"And that hurt you?" Brooke wondered aloud. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"In a way, but probably not why you think," she said vaguely.
When she didn't continue, Brooke swallowed her annoyance. </p>
<p>"In what way then?" she prompted. Sam smirked slightly as she
drove. </p>
<p>"It's not important anymore," she said. "Needless to say. I
got mad and took off. Typical me, I don't deal with my problems but avoid them
instead. Hence creating this wonderful mess I find myself in now." </p>
<p>"With him and Carmen and Lily?" Brooke questioned to clarify
things for herself. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Yup, the formerly four musketeers. I'm now in exile I guess.
My own fault too. I shut them out, ignored them and basically treated them like
garbage," she explained bitterly. "It's no wonder they hate me." </p>
<p>"I'm sure they don't hate you, Sam," Brooke said patiently.
She couldn't imagine anyone hating Sam no matter what the girl did. </p>
<p>"Maybe, maybe not but I screwed things up royally. Our
friendships are ruined," Sam said sadly. </p>
<p>"You can't fix things?" Brooke asked confused. It seemed to
her that if Sam just talked to Carmen and Lily then maybe she could straighten
things out. </p>
<p>"Why bother? It'd only last until I went and did something to
screw it up again," Sam sighed. "Like I always do." Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"Nice attitude to have," she scolded. "First of all, Sam, it
is worth it to try and fix things. These are your friends we're talking about
here. Take it from someone who knows, not having anyone is very lonely," she
pointed out a bit pitifully. </p>
<p>"You have me," Sam spoke up quietly. Brooke smiled.
</p>
<p>"Yes, I do. And for that I am very grateful. But nothing else
is going to fix itself unless you at least TRY to apologize," Brooke advised
wisely Sam was quiet as she thought. </p>
<p>"I really hate it when you're right," she laughed finally.
Brooke just smiled at her smugly. </p>
