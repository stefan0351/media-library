<!-- Telling Series \ Section 7: Dad - Meanwhile Back At The Ranch -->

<p>"You're going to lose them both, you know," Jane snapped at Mike over her
plate of pasta. Mike glared back at her. </p>
<p>"I told you I didn't want to have this discussion. If you won't tell me where
my own daughter is, then we aren't going to have this discussion," he answered
in the same peevish tone. This was life at the Palace without Brooke and Sam.
Meet Mr. and Mrs. Bitch-A-Lot. Mike and Jane could barely stand to be in the
same room together let alone talk. It was a sorry statement concerning their
engagement and Jane was seriously wondering who the Hell it was she was engaged
to and why. She set her fork down with a slam and looked back at Mike. </p>
<p>"Tough. You stand to lose more than Brooke and Sam if you keep this up. As
much as I love you, I can't stand the way you're behaving," she admitted
angrily. Mike huffed at her. </p>
<p>"I'm behaving? You're the one promoting this depraved behavior between our
daughters!" Jane rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"You can't help who you fall in love with, Mike. Jesus, look at us," she
pointed out. </p>
<p>"What the Hell does that mean?" </p>
<p>"Do you rememeber how the girls reacted to our announcement about our
relationship?" Mike nodded. "They acted like we did it just to spite them and
get at them for something. Sound familiar?" Mike turned red. </p>
<p>"But we're in love! How can you call what they have love, Jane?" </p>
<p>"How can you presume to know how they feel?" her voice was beginning to rise
and in the back of her mind she wondered if the neighbors were enjoying the
show. </p>
<p>"If you remember, Jane, those two HATED each other and now they profess to
LOVE each other. I don't see it. I won't accept it!" Mike continued. </p>
<p>"Why? Because they're girls? Because if that's it I think you need to fast
forward and join the rest of us in the 21st century, Mike. Homosexuality is no
longer in the closet. It isn't something whispered about, hidden or something
that happens to someone else's family member. It could be anyone and it isn't
something to be ashamed about anymore. Damn it, the stigma attached is being
chipped away little by little every day. Those two girls were brave and honest
by coming forward and telling you when they could have just snuck around behind
your back forever. God knows you're thick enough that you probably never would
have noticed!" Mike stood up, sending his chair flying. </p>
<p>"I'm not you Jane," he said lowly. "I can't just be OK with this." Jane
rubbed her eyes. </p>
<p>"I'm not asking you to fly a rainbow flag outside the house and march in the
God Damn parade Mike. I'm asking you to take a look at your daughter, Mike. A
good look and see what your reaction is doing to her. She stopped eating again
and we both know that this time, if Sam can't get through to her, we're going to
lose her." Mike picked up his chair and sat back down heavily. Jane lowered her
voice and spoke softer. </p>
<p>"She loves you, Mike, your opinion means a lot to her. You're the only parent
she's had for most of her life and you turned on her and made her feel dirty,
ashamed, evil. And you made her feel that by loving Sam she had failed you.
Brooke is a very proud young lady who hates to fail." Mike buried his head in
his hands as Jane's words struck home. </p>
<p>"She's gay, Jane," he whispered. Jane nodded her head. </p>
<p>"Yes, she is. And she's still the same little girl you raised, that hasn't
changed. The only thing that has is that she loves Sam." He shook his head at
her. </p>
<p>"How can you be all right with that?" Jane gave him a half smile. </p>
<p>"Have you ever looked at the two of them? I mean really looked at them when
they're together and not trying to hide it from someone?" Mike shook his head.
Jane's smile grew. "It's beautiful, Mike. Honestly, you'd cry if you could see
the love between them. I know that sounds corny but it's true. It flows from
every pore of their bodies and it's pure and divine to witness. I've never seen
anything like it before. How can I begrudge something that's obviously so right
for them?" </p>
<p>"But.but." whatever argument Mike had was lost to him. "I'm going to lose her
either way, aren't I?" Jane nodded. </p>
<p>"If you don't get your head out of your ass, yes. And me and Mac too because
I'm not raising her in an intolerant atmosphere. It comes right down to this,
Mike: don't make me chose between you and Sam. Because you'll lose, every time."
