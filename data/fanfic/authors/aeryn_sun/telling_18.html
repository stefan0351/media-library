<!-- Telling Series \ Section 6: Mary Cherry - Short Straw -->

<p>"Just do me a favor and never join the debate team, Sam, that's all I'm
asking," Brooke said as she rested her head on Sam's abdomen and they both lay
sprawled on her bed later that night. She felt a rumble of laughter ripple
though Sam. </p>
<p>"Why's that, Princess?" Sam asked as she ran her hands through Brooke's hair
absently, reveling in the silky feel. </p>
<p>"I love to watch you argue. I think that's why I used to fight with you so
much. I love the way you light up when you get your groove on. It's such a turn
on," Brooke admitted with a smile. Another rumble of laughter went through Sam.
</p>
<p>"I get it. If I joined the Debate Team you'd want to jump my bones everytime
I got on stage and tried to argue a point. And while that wouldn't be a bad
thing for me, it might make scoring difficult for the judges to decide. So
noted." Brooke shifted slightly so that she could look into Sam's half lidded
eyes which stared back at her full of mirth and love. </p>
<p>"Yeah, well, Mary Cherry's lucky she interrupted when she did or she REALLY
would have gotten more than she bargined for." Sam scrunched up her nose. </p>
<p>"Ew, not into audiences, Princess," she stuck out her tongue at the thought.
Brooke moved up to capture the errant tongue and give it something better to do.
</p>
<p>"Am I really your Princess?" Brooke asked after she broke away minutes later
and stared intently into Sam's warm brown eyes. Sam cocked her head to the side
and smiled. </p>
<p>"Have you always had a knack for changing horses midstream or is it an
acquired talent?" Brooke swatted her on the arm and leaned into her embrace to
snuggle. </p>
<p>"Answer me, please. I need to know. You call me that all the time. Am I
really your Princess?" Sam frowned. </p>
<p>"Of course you are. Why would you think that you weren't, Brooke? To say that
I worship you, aside from sounding incredibly cheesy, would be too bland, it
wouldn't be enough to express how much you mean to me. Even saying 'I love you'
doesn't seem enough to make you understand the depth of what I feel for you."
</p>
<p>"Sammy," Brooke broke in, starting to cry. Sam wiped away her tears while
shaking her head. </p>
<p>"Let me finish, you asked. You are my Princess. You are my everything. Even
if I lost everything, everyone, if I still had you, I could survive it because
you'd be there. Even if I hadn't regained my voice or the use of my legs after
the accident, I think that if I had you by my side I would have been all right,
Brooke. You once called me your saviour, your hero. Well, you're mine, Brooke.
And I love you, with more words than even me, the writer, can say." Brooke was
crying openly now and Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"I hate it when you cry. I hate making you cry," Sam said sadly. Brooke shook
her head. </p>
<p>"Happy tears," she explained. "You say the most beautiful things, Sammy. I
love you and I love being your Princess." She reached over and kissed Sam again,
showing her exactly how much. Sam broke away a few minutes later, much to
Brooke's disappointment. </p>
<p>"Mom and Mike are home. We can't," Sam lamented. "We're a little TOO vocal,"
she blushed, which Brooke found endearing. She reached up and brushed some of
Sam's brown hair out of her face. </p>
<p>"I know," Brooke said, longing and desire evident in her voice. "So, we've
told everyone else, now all we have to do is tell Dad." Sam cringed. </p>
<p>"Ick. Not a happy thought, Brooke. So, who should do it?" Brooke shrugged.
</p>
<p>"Flip you for it," she suggested hopefully. Sam glared at her slightly. </p>
<p>"Oh, that's fair, he's your dad," Sam pointed out. Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"Fine, I'll tell him. Soon, I promise. Just make sure you and Mom are there."
Sam leaned her forehead against Brooke's. </p>
<p>"Of course, I would never abandon you," Sam said softly. A wicked smile
suddenly crossed Sam's face and she got up and walked over to Brooke's CD
player. Without saying a word, she went through the cds stacked there until she
found what she wanted and put it into the stereo. Turning the volume up and
pressing play, she sauntered over to the bed, a sexy and mischievous smile on
her face. </p>
<p>"That should do it," she said over the music as she reached for Brooke's
shirt. Brooke smiled back, understanding, and reached for Sam. </p>
<p>Downstairs, Mike wondered why he could hear Shaggy's Hotshot playing so
loudly since Brooke never listened to her stereo so loud but figured she must be
studying with Sam. Meanwhile Jane just shook her head and sighed. </p>
