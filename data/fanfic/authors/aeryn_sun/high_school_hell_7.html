<!-- High School Hell \ Prognosis Redux/Breaking Point -->

<p>"She can't feel anything below her waist, I'm afraid," Dr. Parker said gravely. Jane and Brooke sighed heavily and Mike swore. </p>
<p>"And this happened how, Brooke?" Mike asked a little angrier than he intended. Brooke glared at him for a second. </p>
<p>"Gym class. She was referee, not actually playing and turned her back on one of the guys. According to Lily and Nic," she was unsure who to say witnessed it. "He pulled the stick back and hit her with it square in the back," she explained for what felt like the millionth time. Dr. Parker nodded.</p>
<p>"That's consistant with her injuries. The good news is that it is no doubt temporary. The blow to the spine has caused a catastrophic shock to her system and she's suffering from a major muscle spasm along the area of impact that's putting pressure on the chord itself," he explained. </p>
<p>"What about the bone fragments?" Jane asked fear creeping into her voice. Dr. Parker sighed. </p>
<p>"To be on the safe side, we'd like your permission to go in and remove some of the ones closest to the injured area. But I have to warn you, because of their location, we're taking a risk of doing damage by going in," he said honestly. </p>
<p>"But what if you don't?" Mike asked. </p>
<p>"There's a slight chance that the blow dislodged them enough that they could do more damage on their own," Dr. Parker explained solemnly.</p>
<p>"Jesus," Brooke breathed. "Damned if you do, damned if you don't." </p>
<p>"Afraid so, Brooke. And with the surgery you're looking at a longer recovery time but a better overall prognosis, a less chance of something like this happening again." Jane looked at Mike and Brooke who both nodded.</p>
<p>"Do what you have to, Dr. We trust you," she said evenly. Dr. Parker nodded. </p>
<p>"It'll work out, Sam's a tough girl. Excuse me, I have to go scrub in." They watched as he walked out. Jane turned to Brooke. </p>
<p>"And there was no provication for the attack?" she asked still in shock over the whole thing. Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"Other than the fact that Sam and I are together, no. He just snapped as far as I know. God, I am so sorry," Brooke said guiltily. Jane rubbed her back. </p>
<p>"You have nothing to be sorry for, honey. You did nothing wrong and neither did Sam. The only person to blame is this Pierce boy. Let's just forget about him and concentrate on helping Sam heal." </p>

<p>"Sam? Sam, honey, wake up," Jane encouraged as Sam's eyes fluttered open the next day. Brooke moved from her seat to grasp Sam's hand.</p>
<p>"Come on, Sammy, come back to the land of the conscious," Brooke whispered. </p>
<p>"Go `way," Sam muttered, closing her eyes again. Jane and Brooke exchanged looks and sighs. It was the third time Sam had almost come to only to pass out again. </p>
<p>"Damn it, Sam," Brooke swore. "Wake up all ready or I'll unplug your mophine drip myself." </p>
<p>"Cranky, cranky," Sam whispered back. Brooke and Jane smiled. Sam opened one eye and looked at the two of them. "How bad?" The look that passed over both their faces told Sam all she need to know. She closed her eye again and sighed. </p>
<p>"Sam," Brooke started. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"I can't feel my legs, Brooke. At all. That's not a good sign," Sam spat angrily. Jane placed a comforting hand on her daughter's shoulder. </p>
<p>"Part of that is the medication, Sam," she explained. Sam opened her eyes and looked at her mother expectantly. "They put a spinal block on you that should wear off soon. But, you've had surgery and Pierce did do a little muscle damage so you have to do some rehab again," Sam rolled her eyes. "We've all ready arranged for you to be moved to the same rehab center you went to last spring as soon as you're ready. You'll be in a wheelchair for a little while but like before, you'll get out of it again." </p>
<p>"Ducky," Sam said sarcastically. She turned to Brooke. "What exactly happened?" Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"Pierce Shepard hit you in the back with his hockey stick. The only excuse he's given is a zealous rant about homosexuality being evil. I guess his dad is a Bible thumping reverend or something and Pierce had a crush on me for a while and wasn't very happy that you and I are involved. I think his mind snapped." Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"You seem to have a knack for attracting winners, Princess," Sam joked. Brooke stuck out her tongue. </p>
<p>"Yeah, well, I attracted you, didn't I?" she countered. Sam raspberried her and then smirked. </p>
<p>"I'm a winner, doncha know?" Jane rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"Are you OK, Sam?" she asked bringing the conversation back to a serious topic. Sam blinked at her. </p>
<p>"No, I'm paralyzed again. What kind of question is that? Would you be all right?" Sam asked curtly. Brooke winced as she suddenly heard them all collide with Sam's `breaking point' like a car colliding with a brick wall at 200mph. </p>
<p>"Sam, I?" Jane tried to explain but Sam was still going. Brooke knew this wasn't going to be pretty. Sam's eyes were an unnatural red color from her inner rage. </p>
<p>"Tell you what, Mom. Why don't we wait and see how you feel if Mike dies. Just like Dad did and then I'll ask you if you're OK. Then you can see how STUPID A QUESTION IT IS!" she finished in a bellow. Jane stared at her in shock. </p>
<p>"Sam!" Brooke scolded. Sam turned on her. </p>
<p>"What? You don't think that was a stupid question too?" Sam asked. </p>
<p>"That's not the point, that was way out of line," Brooke snapped. Sam glared at her. </p>
<p>"Well, it was a stupid question. I am not all right. I don't want to go through this again. You have no idea what this is like." </p>
<p>"Sam, you're not going through this alone. It'll be all right," Brooke reassured her. Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"Let's switch places, Brooke. And then you tell me the same thing." </p>
<p>"I'd give anything for you not to be lying in that bed right now," Brooke whispered as tears fell down her face. Sam mentally kicked herself for her behavior. Brooke was suffering too, she just didn't see it. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Princess," she apologized. "I'm just scared."</p>
<p>"I know you are, Sammy. I am too. But we'll get through this. Together." Sam smiled. </p>
<p>"Together," she echoed. She hated the entire idea of going through this again and was hoping to find that it was a nightare. But she knew it wasn't. She looked at Brooke who smiled reassuringly at her. (I hope I have enough strength for this go `round, Princess. I'd hate to disappoint you) </p>
