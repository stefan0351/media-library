<!-- High School Hell \ Wedding Preparations -->

the look plainly said. </p>
<p>"What?" Sam asked warily. Jane sighed. She knew this wasn't going to go over well. </p>
<p>"He's invited some family and co-workers who still don't know about you two and would appreciate it if you could not let on that you're involved with each other," Jane said as gently as she could. Sam groaned. </p>
<p>"Jerk," she muttered. </p>
<p>"You have got to be kidding," Brooke said angrily. "Everytime I think that man has taken a step forward, he takes three steps back. God, I wish he'd make up his friggin' mind." </p>
<p>"Brooke," Sam started softly. </p>
<p>"No, Sam, I'm tired of his hedging. Either open the door all the way or lock it behind him but stop opening it and then slamming it in our faces," Brooke ranted. "God, he is so infuriating." </p>
<p>"I know, honey and I tried to talk to him about it but he won't back down on this one thing," Jane apologized. "He's better with dealing with the two of you but this is just expecting too much from him. You know I don't have a problem with it, I'd rather see the two of you happy?" </p>
<p>"We know, Mom," Sam broke in as she stepped out of the dressing booth and handed her mother her gown. She opened the door to Brooke's booth and enveloped the upset blonde in a gentle hug. </p>
<p>"Come on, Princess, playing it straight for one night won't kill us," she whispered in Brooke's ear. Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"I really wanted to dance with you Sammy," she complained. Sam smirked. </p>
<p>"Who said we can't dance?" </p>
<p>"A real dance, Sam. A couple's dance," she sighed again. "I love you and I'm proud of that. I'm proud of us; we've come a long way. I hate that Dad makes us hide it." Sam hugged her tighter. </p>
<p>"So do I. But this is his and Mom's special day, not ours. We'll have our own someday, maybe," Brooke's eyes lit up. "Besides, we can dance anytime you want to." </p>
<p>"You mean it?" </p>
<p>"Of course I do. So, think you can do this? If not for your Dad, than how about for Mom?" Sam asked. Brooke nodded reluctantly. She turned to Jane. </p>
<p>"I don't like it and I plan to let him know that, but I'll do it," she said. Jane smiled. </p>
<p>"I don't like it either, Brooke. But thank you both."</p>

<p>Brooke lay in her bed staring at the ceiling. She couldn't sleep. She was so annoyed at her father she could slap him, she very nearly did when she'd tried to talk to him about her and Sam and the wedding and he made his wishes clear. There was to be no indication at all that they were anything more than friends and stepsisters. </p>
<p>(Narrowminded, hypocritical jerk) she seethed in silence. (Why can't he just move on?) </p>
<p>Deciding she wasn't going to be able to sleep where she was, she crawled out of bed and walked quietly across to Sam's room. Sam was asleep, snoring softly. </p>
<p>(I should record her, she doesn't believe she snores) Brooke laughed to herself. She carefully climbed into the bed beside Sam who automatically rolled over and cuddled up to her. Brooke smiled at the unconscious reaction from Sam. </p>
<p>(Who would have figured Sam for a cuddler?) she thought with another smile. She wrapped her arms around the warm body and thought about everything they'd been through. The accident seemed like a lifetime ago and yet only yesterday. So much had changed and yet they were still Brooke and Sam. She just wished her father could see that. They were still the same two girls they'd always been it was only one thing that had actually changed. She sighed causing Sam to stir slightly. </p>
<p>"Brooke?" Sam asked groggily. Brooke kissed her forehead.</p>
<p>"I couldn't sleep so I came in here. Go back to sleep, Sammy," she whispered. Sam sighed and snuggled closer. </p>
<p>"Love you," Sam yawned as she drifted off again. Brooke immediately felt better at hearing those words. </p>
<p>"Love you too, Sammy," she answered as she closed her eyes. Sam's steady breathing and heartbeat lulled her into a trancelike state until she was finally able to fall asleep.</p>
