<!-- Telling Series \ Section 2: Lily & Josh - That Means Really Happy, Right? -->

<p>Sam and Brooke joined Lily and Josh for the rest of the movie
and had a good time even if the movie was rather lame. Josh and Lily told them
all about married life and how it wasn't what they expected but that it was
starting to work out. Granted they saw each other at school but lately the two
pairs were drifting in separate directions and it was nice to catch up. Lily was
glad Sam was nearly fully recovered from her experience vs. Nicole's car and
Josh was still bewildered as to why the whole thing happened. </p>
<p>"You know women, Josh, piss us off and we go bonkers," Sam
joked even as Brooke's eyes held that little glimmer of unresolved issues about
the whole incident. Sometimes it worried Sam that Brooke still carried such
heavy baggage from that night on such a slight frame. She had suggested
psychotherapy for the both of them but was unceremoniously shot down.
</p>
<p>"I know but, this is Nicole. Brooke's best friend and she
tried to kill her. God, Sam if you hadn't been there," Josh started. Brooke
stood up and started to pace. </p>
<p>"But I was," Sam cut in, hoping to prevent a Brooke bomb from
going off. "And I'm OK now. It was a long, bumpy road but the end result was
more than worth the pain," she directed the last comment at Brooke. Brooke
looked at her and immediately relaxed and smiled. </p>
<p>Lily frowned. (What is going on here?) she thought.
</p>
<p>"All right, you two, spill. You've both been wound up like
dervishes all night and if you don't start talking soon, I'm going to go
bonkers," Lily informed them. Brooke and Sam exchanged nervous glances, which
only went to further Lily's suspicions. </p>
<p>"Uhm, Josh, Lily, we need to talk to you about something,"
Brooke started. </p>
<p>"Something really big," Sam added. </p>
<p>"And we just want you to hear us out before you freak out and
like yell and run out of here," Brooke continued. </p>
<p>"And we ask that you keep it between the four of us and give
us a chance to tell the others at our on pace," Sam kept going. Frankly they
were giving Lily a headache and poor Josh couldn't keep up. </p>
<p>"Let me get this straight," Lily interjected before the two
started up again and she lost entire track of the conversation. "You have
something big to tell us," two nods, "that you don't want us to freak out over,"
two more nods, "and that you want to keep to ourselves for now," two last nods.
"OK, got it. Lay it on us." </p>
<p>Sam looked at Brooke who simply shrugged and looked back at
her. </p>
<p>"Oh, you're a lot of help," Sam sighed. "Josh, Lily, we're in
love." There she said it. She winced and waited for the fallout. </p>
<p>A huge smile began to spread across Lily's face. As it got
larger, Sam swore that if it got any bigger the girl's head would split in two.
(Is this a good reaction or is she plotting something horrible against us? Is
Lily capable of plotting something horrible?) Sam wondered. </p>
<p>"That's great," Josh said, shocking both girls. "With who?"
Lily sighed, closed her eyes and smacked herself upside the forehead. She looked
back at Sam and Brooke. </p>
<p>"And to think, I married him," she said wearily. Josh looked
at all three girls, obviously not keeping up with the converation. </p>
<p>"What? What did I say?" he asked, genuinely confused. Lily
gave him a gentle pat on the shoulder. </p>
<p>"With each other, Josh. And not as sisters. `In love', in
love. Sam and Brooke are in love with each other," she explained softly, like a
parent explaining that no, Josh, there is no Santa Claus. Josh looked back and
forth between Sam and Brooke for a few minutes in dumb silence. </p>
<p>"But they're girls," he whispered to Lily as if she didn't
know. Lily rolled her eyes and sighed. She really hoped their children, if they
ever had any, took after her side in the brains department. </p>
<p>"Very observant of you, honey. They're also gay," she said. </p>
<p>"Happy?" Josh said hopefully. Sam and Brooke, who were
actually trying not to laugh, just shook their heads. </p>
<p>"No, homosexual. Although I'm sure happy does factor in there
somewhere," Lily continued. Sam and Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Oh," Josh said, as it started to sink in. "Oh!" he repeated,
finally getting it. He blinked a few times as he processed the information and
then stood up abruptly. "I have to go now," he said as he headed for the door. </p>
<p>"Josh," chorused Lily, Brooke, and Sam. Josh turned and looked
at all three. </p>
<p>"I'm OK, with this, really. It's just, Brooke, you were my
first love. I lost my virginity with you. You're still really special to me.
Don't get me wrong, I really love you Lily. I just need some time to think about
this. My first love just told me she's gay, it's kind of a shock," he said
honestly. As he reached the door he turned back again. </p>
<p>"Hey, Sam, I've always liked you. You're a pretty cool person.
If you make Brooke happy, than that's all that matters to me. But get this
straight right here and now, you hurt her and you'll answer to me, got it?" Sam
nodded. </p>
<p>"Duly noted, Josh," Sam responded. </p>
<p>"And don't worry, I won't say a word at school. I care for you
and respect you both too much to do that. I can understand what it must have
taken for the two of you to have told us this. Thank you for your honesty. I'll
see you at home, Lily. Love you," he said as he left. </p>
<p>"Wow, that didn't go as horribly awry as I'd feared," Brooke
said in relief as she flopped down on the couch. Sam sat down next to her and
wrapped her arms around her as Lily watched. </p>
<p>"Does this bother you Lily? Because I can not do it when
you're around," Sam said hastily as she started to remove her arms. Lily
laughed. </p>
<p>"No, it's fine. It's cute actually. I was just thinking what
an unnaturally and sinfully good-looking couple you were." Brooke stared at her
for a minute. </p>
<p>"You know, you're taking this awfully well." Lily shrugged. </p>
<p>"I saw this coming," Lily informed them. They both stared at
her, mouths agape. "What? You think just because I'm the little sweet one that I
don't see what's going on around me? I protest and crusade and never actually
notice the one thing going on under my nose? Please. There was enough sexual
tension between the two of you since the seventh grade to light a million fires.
Anyone who got too close got their eyebrows singed and after the accident, I
noticed the little changes, the looks, the way you flirted. Just because no one
else wants to acknowledge it doesn't mean I didn't." Brooke buried her face in
her hands either in distress or relief, Sam and Lily weren't sure and Sam just
smiled. </p>
<p>"Were you ever going to share this little tidbit of
information with the rest of us?" Lily arched an eyebrow and smirked.
</p>
<p>"And miss out on the free daily show? Hell no! It was better
than basic cable. Besides, you both would have had me carted away to the nearest
psychiatric facility." </p>
<p>"She has a point," Brooke said through her hands. Sam cuddled
closer and rested her head on Brooke's shoulder. </p>
<p>"What about Josh?" Lily waved her off. </p>
<p>"He'll be fine. Probably better than fine given the wonderful
mental imagery you two just supplied him with," Lily said sarcastically with a
hint of mirth. Brooke groaned into her hands and Sam snickered at her
discomfort, which got her an elbow to the ribs. </p>
<p>"Have you told your parents?" Lily asked hoping to allieviate
some of Brooke's discomfort. </p>
<p>"Mom knows, but we're holding out on telling Mike until the
bomb shelter's completed," another elbow to the rib. "Ow, stop that before you
rebreak them," Sam ordered as the last blow actually hurt. </p>
<p>"Sorry," Brooke said honestly, lifting her head and looking at
Sam who kissed her lightly on the tip of her nose. </p>
<p>"Hey, I just had a good thought," Lily piped up. Sam and
Brooke looked at her expectantly. "Not that it was ever a real worry, but now I
really don't have to worry about ever losing Josh back to you Brooke." She tried
valiantly to avoid the flying couch pillows tossed in her direction but to no
avail. </p>
