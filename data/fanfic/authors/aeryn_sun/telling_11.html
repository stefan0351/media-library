<!-- Telling Series \ Section 4: Carmen - It Was A Dream And You Were There, And You Were And... -->

<p>"I'm just saying, it was getting redundant, Carm. Three times
was more than enough. Try and stay conscious long enough to have the
conversation, please," Sam said annoyed. Brooke swatted her on the shoulder as
she handed a cup of water to Carmen who was seated on the couch. She kept
looking from Brooke to Sam and back like they were little grey space aliens come
to take her away for experimentation and it was beginning to bug the Hell out of
Sam. </p>
<p>"S...sorry," Carmen stuttered, still in a state of shock. She
sipped at the water and continued to stare at Sam and Brooke who were leaned up
against the sink. Sam rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Oh, for Christ's sake, Carm! Hello, still Sam McPherson and
Brooke McQueen over here! Same two people you've known your entire life. That
hasn't changed. Nothing actually has. We just faced the fact that our sexual
preference is for women and oh, gee, look, each other. How convienent for us,
living in the same house and all," Sam huffed. </p>
<p>"Knock it off, Sam," Brooke snapped, fed up with Sam's temper.
Sam glared at her. </p>
<p>"Well, she can at least say SOMETHING," Sam shot back. "At
least Harrison ranted and raved like the little homophobe he is. Lily and Josh
let us know how they felt but she's sitting there like she's afraid she's on the
menu or something." Sam turned her gaze to Carmen. "If you HAVE been talking to
Harrison, the little prick, there's nothing in the drinking water and we're not
going to convert you." She pushed away from the sink and paced around the Novac
like a caged animal while Brooke just rubbed her eyes and sighed. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Carmen spoke up suddenly, making both Sam and
Brooke jump. "You shocked me is all. What do you want me to say, huh? How would
you like it if I dropped a bomb like that on you? You would be at a loss for
words too, you know," she snapped, her voice taking on the same angry tone Sam's
had. </p>
<p>"You know what I'd say? I'd say `are you happy?' Cuz that's
all that matters in the long run," Sam answered curtly. Carmen stood up.
</p>
<p>"That's not all that matters. You're only thinking about
yourselves. Do you even know what you're doing? Do you have any idea what this
is going to do to everybody else?" </p>
<p>"'Everybody else'? What the Hell does it matter what it does
to everybody else? Sam and I are the only ones it should matter to," Brooke
spoke up, surprising Carmen and Sam with the contempt in her voice. </p>
<p>"I am so sick and tired of living with what everyone else
thinks of me and having it hanging over my head, Carmen. Fitting the mold to
make someone else happy. Sam makes me happy. For the first time in my life I
found something that makes me absolutely happy that I don't have to kill myself
or change myself for. She loves me for me and I don't give a flying good God
Damn what that does to everyone else. You got that?" Brooke advanced on Carmen
with a dangerous glint in her eyes making Carmen back away. Sam watched the show
wishing for a bag of popcorn. Or a camcorder. </p>
<p>"If you're going to pull a `Harrison', go right ahead. We went
through that once, it sucked but we can go through it again. I always liked you,
Carmen, you wanna know why? It's because you never judged people. You never
cared what anyone looked like or what they acted like. You like people because
of who they are inside and the Hell with everything else. Well, guess what? I'm
gay! Sam's gay! And we're gay together! And if you can't accept that, well,
there's the door, don't let it hit you in the ass on the way out!" </p>
<p>Carmen stared back at her for a few minutes in stunned silence
at the tirade from the normally serene and sociable cheerleader and then looked
over at Sam, her former best friend, who shrugged back at her. </p>
<p>"But.but it's wrong," Carmen whispered. Sam sighed in defeat. </p>
<p>"You didn't say that when it was Harrison's mom," she said
patiently as she walked over to Brooke and rubbed the still upset girl's back
soothingly. "And I've got to wonder, how can any love like this be wrong? You
don't know how we feel about each other, Carm, you couldn't possibly understand.
My Mom has given us her blessing and for now, that's enough. Lily and Josh are
OK with us and showed us what true friends really are. Can you say the same?"
Carmen shook her head. </p>
<p>"I don't.I don't know," she said softly. And she really
didn't. This was a lot to take in all at once. (These two used to hate each
other and now they love each other?) She was baffled. (The sky is still blue
right? What goes up must come down and Sam and Brooke love each other.one of
these things doesn't go with the natural order of the universe) </p>
<p>"Honesty is a good place to start," Brooke said having
regained control of her normal voice. "Take the time you need Carmen, we want
you as a friend but if that isn't possible, we understand. But please, keep this
between us, OK? Until we tell everyone ourselves?" Carmen nodded. </p>
<p>"I can give you that much," Carmen admitted. "I have to go,"
she said as she left the Novac. Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"I'm really starting to dread these little heart to hearts
with our friends," she complained. Sam kissed her and held her close.
</p>
<p>"Just think, we have Nicole and Mary Cherry, Sugar and then,
and we saved the best for last, Mike left." </p>
<p>"That's not helpful," Brooke warned. </p>
<p>"I know. I'm not sure I'm built for all this emotional trauma.
On the bright side, at least when we tell Nicole, she can't try to run us over
again," Sam chirped. Brooke groaned. </p>
<p>"Do me a favor, Sam? When you become a writer, don't go into
comedy." </p>
