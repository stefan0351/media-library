<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Chapter Four -->

<p>"OK, let's try that AGAIN!" Brooke ordered the Glamazon squad who groaned collectively. "Don't groan at me. Tell Miss Julian to get her ass in gear and maybe the routine won't suck so bad. Maybe you guys don't mind looking like shit at the basketball game, but I DO!"</p>
<p>"Come on, Nicole," Carmen muttered. "Would it kill you to put a LITTLE effort into this? She's going to work us to death unless you do."</p>
<p>"Ah know, Nic. Did y'all break yer groove thang, cuz you ain't got no rhythm an' yer throwin' th' rest of us off," Mary Cherry scolded. Nicole sighed. Really, she was trying but during warm ups, Brooke had 'accidentally' lost her grip on a stand and Nicole had fallen hard to the ground. Now there wasn't a place on her body that didn't hurt. And the grin that flashed across Brooke's face had only made her angrier. But the harder she tried to keep up with Brooke and the routine, the harder Brooke made it for her.</p>
<p>"Tell Drill Sgt. McQueen to back off and maybe then we'll get it right. Freaking perfectionist," she snapped at the two girls.</p>
<p>"Don' go blamin' Brookie cuz yer too tired from playin' wit' yer girlfriend," Mary Cherry shuddered.</p>
<p>"Shut up, Mary Cherry," Nicole ordered.</p>
<p>"Hey, if you three in back are done with the private pow-wow, you want to join the REST of us?" Brooke sneered. Nicole threw her hands in the air in frustration.</p>
<p>"Forget it, Brooke. I'm done for the day. I'm leaving," she announced. Brooke put her hands on her hips and smiled.</p>
<p>"Oh really?" she challenged. Nic looked at her and nodded.</p>
<p>"Really. Now what are YOU going to do about it?" she retorted. Brooke waved sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Bye bye, Nic. You were on probation, remember? One slip up and boom, off the squad. Turn in your jacket and go home, you're through," Brooke gloated triumphantly. Nicole's jaw dropped open and she gaped at the taller blonde.</p>
<p>"WHAT?" she screeched.</p>
<p>"You heard me. Principal Krupps said the first time you were uncooperative or disruptive that you were off the squad. I think walking out on practice for the basketball finals counts as both, don't you?" She didn't give Nicole time to respond. "Hey, Popita, you know the routine?" Popita Fresh, a chronic benchwarmer sprang up from her seat, excited to be remembered and addressed.</p>
<p>"Yes!" the girl chirped confidently.</p>
<p>"Then fall in and let's do this right so we can go home," Brooke said. She smirked at Nicole as the squad started the routine again. "Bye bye," she said out loud. 'I win' she mouthed to the girl as Nicole stalked away.</p>
<p>&lt;Take something away from me, Nicole, and I'll do the same to you&gt; Brooke warned silently. &lt;And I'm only getting started&gt;</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Nicole watched Sam as she slept, spent after another busy 'date'. The girl was passionate; Nicole had to give her that. And unfortunately, Nicole was feeling things she didn't want to feel. She couldn't let herself get too tangled emotionally with Sam. That wasn't what this relationship was about. Whether Sam knew it or not, Nicole was just using her. And if she ended up with, ew, 'feelings' for the brunette, it would make carrying out her plan to destroy Brooke, claim her throne as well as get revenge on Sam for every expose and biased article the girl had ever written, that much harder. Not that it would stop her, it would just make it that much more difficult.</p>
<p>She sighed and despite her reservations, moved closer to Sam, wanting to feel the warmth of her body. Nicole's world was cold, unfeeling; but Sam was warm and caring and it was something new to Nicole. She found that she craved it and didn't want to let it go.</p>
<p>&lt;Yeah, that's all this is. Infatuation with something new&gt; she told herself. &lt;Besides, I'm not capable of caring for anyone but myself and I've worked hard to get that way. I sure as Hell am NOT going to change that for Spam McPherson&gt; </p>
<p>"Mmmm, Nic?" Sam called softly. Nicole brushed the girls? long hair away from her face and smiled.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" </p>
<p>"What time is it?" Sam asked as she opened her eyes and blinked fuzzily at Nicole.</p>
<p>"A little after 11," Nicole told her.</p>
<p>"Shit, I'm gonna be late for curfew, I gotta go," Sam complained, waking up fully and starting to get up. Nicole pulled her in for a kiss before she got out of the bed.</p>
<p>"I had fun," she said. Sam smiled at her.</p>
<p>"So did I," she smirked. "We should do it again sometime." Nicole nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, how's tomorrow sound?" she asked jokingly. Sam laughed.</p>
<p>"After practice?" she tossed back. Nicole frowned.</p>
<p>"I got thrown off the squad," she whispered. Sam scowled as she pulled on her clothes.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Brooke threw me off the squad. She's on some sort of meglomaniacal powertrip and replaced me with Popita Fresh," Nicole explained. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"Popita still goes to Kennedy?" she said absently. "Anyway, I can't believe Brooke did that. I'll talk to her and see what's up, OK?"</p>
<p>"Don't bother, Sam," Nicole bluffed, loving the thought of Sam and Brooke arguing over this point. It would drive them further apart and it was Brooke's own fault.</p>
<p>"It's not a bother, Nic," Sam said, leaning down and kissing Nic on the end of the nose. "I can't guarantee that you'll get your spot back but maybe I can find out what her problem is."</p>
<p>"If you want to," Nicole sighed dramatically, pouring it on thick for Sam's benefit. And Sam bought it; hook, line, and sinker.</p>
<p>"I want to. Talk to you tomorrow, Nic."</p>
