<!-- No Regrets \ Shared Pain -->

<p>She hated seeing Sam this way; so fragile and vulnerable; so dependent on others to help her. Brooke knew Sam would hate to be seen in her condition as well, being as stubborn and strong-willed as the girl normally was. But sadly, Sam was unaware of her present condition and situation, still unconscious as she was. Still under more medications than Brooke knew ever existed as they waited for the brunette?s brutally broken body to try and heal itself.</p>
<p>She lightly traced her fingers over Sam?s healed nose, relieved to see it back to its normal color.</p>
<p>"You looked silly with two black eyes, Sammy," she whispered jokingly. Truthfully the young girl looked terrible with the broken nose and associated black eyes. They?d swelled up and although Sam was unconscious, Brooke would have liked it if she?d been able to see more of Sam?s eyes at the time. Now all that remained of that injury was some slight bruising that was fading quickly.</p>
<p>Her fingers moved down to track over Sam?s full lips.</p>
<p>"You have the softest lips of anyone I know," Brooke continued, concentrating on Sam?s features. She?d come so close to losing the other girl that she was determined to memorize everything about her while she could. Sam was calm for the moment, not whimpering in fear or crying at some unknown pain. Again, Brooke wished that the doctors would decide that Sam was healthy enough to bring back around. She desperately needed to hear the acerbic wit Sam was known for. And the girl?s gentle laugh that just seemed to roll over her like warm waves.</p>
<p>"Where have you gone, my Sammy?" she asked rhetorically. She often wondered where Sam was, mentally. Was she anywhere at all or trapped in that one horrific moment? Brooke worried about that.</p>
<p>"Come back to me, Sam," she begged quietly. "I need you. It?s lonely out here without you."</p>
<p>"Brooke?" Brooke jumped out of fright, at first thinking that Sam had spoken her name. Movement in the doorway caught her eye and she looked over to see Lily standing uncertainly in the arch. "Can I come in?" A nod granted entry and the petite Latina joined Brooke in her sentry duty beside Sam?s bed.</p>
<p>"How is she?" Lily asked quietly while looking at the prone body of her best friend. It killed her to see the normally vivacious Sam so still and silent. It just seemed wrong and unnatural to her. Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"Better, but not good," the blonde said softly. It seemed that some of the life had drained out of Brooke as well. She no longer spoke with the same energy she once did, almost like she was afraid that too loud a voice might disturb Sam?s rest.</p>
<p>"Some of the wires are gone," Lily observed trying to keep a somewhat detached tone. Her heart twisted with the memory of all the wires and tubes that once led from Sam?s body to various machines.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Brooke nodded. "She can breathe now. Her lungs are stronger. And they took away the drain from her head." Brooke reached out and ruffled Sam?s new shorter hair.</p>
<p>"She?s going to hate that haircut," Lily said light-heartedly. She saw a ghost of a smile cross Brooke?s face.</p>
<p>"I know. It?ll grow back, Sammy," she assured the other brunette. Lily watched Brooke treat Sam with the utmost love and care. She had been watching the blonde do so since the accident. There was something between the would-be stepsisters, Lily could see that. And in Lily?s opinion, they belonged together. She only hoped that Brooke didn?t lose Sam before it worked itself out.</p>
<p>"She looks a little thin," Lily said more to herself than Brooke. Brooke looked at her for a second and then back at Sam.</p>
<p>"She?s eating liquids through a tube, Lily. If you can call it ?eating? at all. She can?t exactly enjoy a steak dinner right now," she said shortly.</p>
<p>"I know. I?m sorry," Lily apologized just to appease the blonde. They were quiet for a while before Lily spoke again.</p>
<p>"Brooke, I need to talk to you," she said gently. Brooke turned her attention to her. "I need to tell you something. I wanted you to hear it from a friend and not on the news or in the paper." Brooke frowned.</p>
<p>"What?" she asked.</p>
<p>"It?s about Nicole?" Lily started. The expression on Brooke?s face turned cold, hard and mean.</p>
<p>"We don?t discuss her, especially in front of Sammy," she informed Lily angrily. Lily sighed.</p>
<p>"I know, Brooke, but, it?s about the night of the accident. Her hearing was today and you didn?t show. It?s going to be all over the news." </p>
<p>As luck would have it, Nicole suffered nothing but a severe hangover and an arrest the night she ran down Sam. Many a night Brooke rallied against the unfairness of it. Here lay Sam, the innocent in all this, dead to the world in her hospital bed, no one knowing what her condition would be once the doctors brought her around again. And then there was Nicole, the orchestrater of the nightmare, sitting pretty at home out on bond while a team of expensive lawyers lobbied in her defense. </p>
<p>"Fine, what is it?" Brooke snapped. Lily flinched at the anger in Brooke?s voice. No one mentioned Nicole to her, not wanting to upset Brooke or bring the lanky cheerleader?s wrath down upon themselves.</p>
<p>"She got off," Lily whispered. Brooke leapt from her chair, knocking it back a few paces as she lunged to her feet.</p>
<p>"SHE WHAT?" she bellowed. Lily swallowed and forged ahead with the explanation.</p>
<p>"She got away with it. There?s no proof that she was drinking that night. Either they never did a blood alcohol test on her or the results were conveniently lost. There was no evidence to prove that she?d had a sip of anything. Her lawyers argued that you and Sam ran out in front of her car and that she swerved to avoid you. That?s why she hit the sidewalk. She got a ticket for driving too fast that night, paid it off and she?s free."</p>
<p>"God damn it! I knew she?d pull something like this," Brooke seethed. "Her and her freaking family money. They probably paid everyone off to keep her out of trouble. And now what? She goes free, never pays for what she did and we have to sit here and watch Sam waste away in the hospital, hoping and praying that she pulls out of it? It?s NOT FAIR!"</p>
<p>Sam let out a whimper and her heart monitor increased in rhythm. </p>
<p>"Brooke, I know it?s not fair but it?s the way it worked out. There?s nothing we can do now except help Sam come through this," Lily tried to calm Brooke down as she paced restlessly.</p>
<p>"DAMN IT!" Brooke screamed making Lily jump at the outburst. Sam cried out again and twitched on the bed.</p>
<p>"I swear to God, Lily, I?m going to make her pay for this," Brooke growled. Lily had never seen such anger or rage on Brooke?s kind face before. It scared her. </p>
<p>"Brooke?"</p>
<p>"No, Lily. If it?s the last thing I do, Nicole will know what this sort of pain is like." Brooke was literally trembling with rage. She was going to say more on her anti-Nicole rant but a gasp and cry from Sam drew her attention.</p>
<p>"Sammy?" She darted over to Sam?s side to see Sam silently crying, panting and her heart monitor beeping at an alarming rate. "Shit, what?s wrong?" Brooke started to panic. Lily sized the situation up immediately.</p>
<p>"Brooke, she can sense your distress and it?s upsetting her," Lily explained calmly. "You have to calm down." Brooke took a few deep breaths and picked up Sam?s hand in her own.</p>
<p>"Shhh, Sammy, I?m right here. It?s OK, calm down," she soothed. "I?m sorry. I didn?t mean to upset you, I just got mad." </p>
<p>It didn?t seem to help as Sam?s cries grew more agitated and she arched off the bed.</p>
<p>"Jesus," Brooke swore. "Lily, help me hold her still so she doesn?t hurt herself."</p>
<p>"Brooke, I?" Lily hedged, scared that she might hurt Sam.</p>
<p>"Damn it, Lily! Hold down her other arm so she doesn?t yank out any wires. If she doesn?t calm down soon the nurses will be in here to sedate her again. I don?t want them plugging her with anymore medication than absolutely necessary so HELP ME!"</p>
<p>Lily did as she was told and carefully held on to Sam?s arm as the unconscious girl weakly fought against her. Brooke whispered gently into Sam?s ear.</p>
<p>"Sammy?Sammy, love, you have to calm down. If you don?t then the doctors will give you more shots and you might not hear me talking for a while. You don?t want that, do you? I don?t," she said softly. Sam let out a low wail. "Shhh, I know you?re scared. So am I. But I?m here with you and Lily?s visiting right now. So neither of us is alone. And nothing can hurt you here, Sammy. You?re safe." </p>
<p>Slowly, Lily felt Sam?s struggles begin to cease although the girl still trembled. She and Brooke released Sam and sat back down. The Latina watched as Brooke lovingly wiped Sam?s fallen tears away with her fingertips.</p>
<p>"That?s my girl," Brooke whispered as Sam relaxed a little more. Lily stood up to go.</p>
<p>"Brooke, I only came to tell you about the verdict," she explained as Brooke only turned a portion of her attention to her. "I?m going to leave you with Sam. I know she?s in good hands with you. You?re taking great care of her. Call me if you need anything. Anything at all, OK?" Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"OK."</p>
<p>"Oh, and Brooke?" Lily called from the doorway. Brooke looked up at her and Lily gave her a half smile. "I hope she comes back to you soon."</p>
