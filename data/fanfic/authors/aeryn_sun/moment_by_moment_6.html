<!-- Moment by Moment \ 6. Regrouping -->

<p>She slept in my bed last night. Said she didn't want to be
alone anymore. What was I going to say, `no'? </p>
<p>Yeah, right. Not in this millennium.</p>
<p>And I'll tell you a secret. Sam snores. </p>
<p>Like, not a `buzz saw' snore. More like a heavy sigh or a cute
little burbling sound. It's really cute, but I said that already
didn't I?</p>
<p>She's been in her own room for over an hour, again repeating the same
song on her CD player over and over. This time it's Creed's `What
if?'. I think she's moved on from anguish to anger, which is a good
sign. Maybe now we can move on to the important things, like kicking
Nicole's peroxide ass so hard her natural birth parents feel it.</p>
<p>Teehee, sounds like fun.</p>
<p>"Hey Brooke?" Her head whips around the door into my room. </p>
<p>NARF!</p>
<p>She's wearing a white tank top with tight jeans, black sneakers and a
silver choker on her neck. And I think my brain just stopped
functioning. Talk amongst yourselves?</p>
<p>"Gah??" I think I just responded to her. Did I respond?</p>
<p>Am I drooling?</p>
<p>She's smiling at me and if I turn into any more of a puddle I'm going
to have to change my clothes.</p>
<p>"I wanted to know if you wanted go out and to rent some DVD's with
me. It's Sunday and other than football, there's nothing on TV. I'm
not up to actually going out for extended periods of time but I
wouldn't mind hanging out here at home with you."</p>
<p>Define me now as mush. I'm that far gone. And that happy that she's
reaching out to me.</p>
<p>"Sure," I chirp and wince because I sound like I've been sucking on
helium.</p>
<p>She lets me drive which is odd given the fact that Sam loves to
drive. She loves the sense of control, she told me as much once. It
makes me wonder if Nicole robbed her of a lot more than I realize.</p>
<p>"Scooby-Doo OK with you?" she asks after we arrive at Blockbuster.
Now open until 1 Am. Poor bastards. I nod and she skips off to grab
a copy.</p>
<p>She comes back with Scooby, Ghost World, Enough, Lost & Delirious,
and E.T. I've already got Murder By Numbers, Frailty, But I'm A
Cheerleader (a fav), and Coyote Ugly in my hands.</p>
<p>"Not planning on going back to school?" I joke and instantly wish I
could retrieve the words from midair. Shit, that was stupid of me.
Her face falls for an instant but then she pulls it back together.</p>
<p>"If I had a choice, no, but I want to spend the day with you,
watching mindless Hollywood drivel, eating and drinking enough junk
food and soda to kill us and forgetting reality for now," she
announces proudly and I laugh. Sounds good.</p>
<p>We're halfway through the fourth movie, (Frailty) when she suddenly
gets serious on me.</p>
<p>"I want to make her pay, Brooke." </p>
<p>I have no doubt about that, Sammy, and I agree. But I have no idea
how to do it.</p>
<p>So I shrug and grab another handful of popcorn. Besides, she's not
actually looking for verbal feedback as much as a sounding board for
her frustration and anger right now.</p>
<p>I may be blonde, but I'm not stupid. Thank you.</p>
<p>She runs a frustrated hand though her hair; she's sitting so close to
me that it hits me softly on the side of the face. Smells like her
shampoo. Smells like Sam.</p>
<p>"She really hurt me, you know? God, I HATE being used, especially
like that. A fucking `fun fuck'. God," she sighs exasperated. </p>
<p>"Like that's all I'm worth? Was that all she was after, my cherry?
Another freaking notch to add to her bedpost? Another story to tell
the next stupid sap that comes down the pike? Another name in her
little mental `little black book'?"</p>
<p>Good points all. She leans down and puts her head in my lap where I
rhythmically start running my fingers through her hair. It's so
automatic and natural that it's almost frightening. And yet elating
at the same time.</p>
<p>"Seriously, Brooke, was she playing me from the get go? Was it all
an act just to get into my pants and fuck me? To say `yeah, I did
her. I was her first?' like it was some sort of accomplishment? I
realize virgins are rare but are we so rare you have to fuck with our
heads for amusement?"</p>
<p>"Nicole hasn't been a virgin since she was 14. She probably doesn't
even remember BEING one," I snort before I can stop myself. "That and
there's a reason she blew out that knee, remember." </p>
<p>Caffeine makes me say things I shouldn't. Example? Watch.</p>
<p>Sam's eyes light up devilishly.</p>
<p>"14? That's young even for her! Who, how, when?"</p>
<p>"Derrick Masters, a senior our freshman year?at a big party?he fell
asleep during the whole thing?gave her a HUGE complex for a long
time," I babble as my mouth gets a mind of its own. How curious.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that all that data comes under the heading `too much
personal information'. And yet, I don't care. It's not MY
information, after all.</p>
<p>That's it. No more Pepsi Blue for me.</p>
<p>Sam's laughing hysterically and I realize I just spilled one of
Nicole's deepest darkest secrets onto the carpet like a glass of
cranberry juice. It's seeping into the carpet and making a stain.
Uh oh.</p>
<p>But wait, there's more?</p>
<p>"She had?uhm?problems for a little while after," I start to explain.
I have Sam's complete attention, she's sitting back up and the movie
is long forgotten.</p>
<p>"Seems that Derrick wasn't very?discriminating about who he slept
with. Nicole ended up not only with a pregnancy scare because `baby,
condoms kill the feel' as Derrick told her, but he also gave her?crabs."</p>
<p>Ew, soda squirted out her nose. Should have been prepared for that.</p>
<p>Damn it I'm never ready it seems.</p>
<p>She falls dramatically off the couch, half-laughing and half-coughing, red in the face and gorgeous as all hell, even with soda on
her face.</p>
<p>It occurs to me to lick it off. Then I mentally smack myself and
help her off the floor, patting her on the back to get the soda out
of her lungs.</p>
<p>"She?she got crabs?" she gasps trying to get oxygen into her
protesting organs. "Like in the health class `play'? She WAS a
crab!"</p>
<p>And you were a very delectable looking little hooker, Sammy dear.</p>
<p>Oops, drifting?</p>
<p>It takes her several minutes to actually calm down after this new
information. I think she thinks to some extent that I might be lying
and stares at me trying to decide. It's the God's honest truth; I
should know, I went to the clinic with Nicole and Marley Jacobs back
when Marley ruled the school and Nic and I were just heirs to the
throne.</p>
<p>Now Marley was a girl with some issues. Too bad she died before she
could handle them.</p>
<p>"Man, I'd give my eye teeth for PROOF of all that," Sam sighs after
she settles, again with her head in my lap. And suddenly a small
idea starts turning itself around in my head.</p>
<p>"Keep your teeth, Sammy, I have a better idea." I know the smirk on
my face has GOT to be downright evil because she's picked up her head
and arched an eyebrow at me.</p>
<p>She narrows her eyes at me but grins.</p>
<p>"What are you planning, oh evil one?" she asks. </p>
<p>"You wanted revenge, right?' She nods. "Then you'll have it," I
promise. Her smile turns into a grin and she puts her head down and
we rewind the DVD to were we lost the story.</p>
<p>"Brooke?" she asks as the credits start at the end and disturbs me
from my petting of her hair.</p>
<p>"Hmmm?"</p>
<p>"Why DID you chose Nikki over Kelly?"</p>
<p>I feel the evil grin this time and put no effort towards stopping it.</p>
<p>"Two words, Sammy?tongue ring."</p>
