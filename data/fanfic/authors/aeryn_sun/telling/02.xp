<chapter title="Section 4: Carmen - Well, That Was Unexpected">
<p>"Well, that was unexpected." </p>
<p>"Yeah, I didn't see that one coming. You think she's OK?" Sam
shrugged. </p>
<p>"I dunno, maybe we should check," Brooke bent over the prone
form of Carmen Ferrera and felt for a pulse. She looked back up at her
girlfriend and nodded. </p>
<p>"Yup, still got a pulse. It's going like a freight train, but
it's beating," she said as she stood back up. They were in the Novac after
school had ended and had run into Carmen. Figuring it was now or never, they had
sprung the news of their relationship on the girl who was wondering about
Harrison's strange behavior lately. Of course, neither girl had expected it to
result in Carmen ending up flat on her back, unconscious on the floor of the
Novac. Well, life was full of funny little surprises. </p>
<p><br/><font color="#3399FF">&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; oh...a flashback </font> </p>
<p>"Either of you know why Harrison would rather sit with April Tuna and Freddy
Gong than the rest of us? I mean, I know our social skills may be somewhat
lacking, except maybe for you Brooke, but really, I mean, April Tuna?" Carmen
asked. Brooke looked at Sam in the mirror as she fixed her eyeliner. Sam looked
around the Novak and saw that it was just the three of them and nodded.
</p>
<p>"We might, Carmen. Have you heard anything strange lately?
About us, I mean?" Sam asked nonchalantly. (Well, she hoped she sounded that way
at least) Carmen thought a minute and shook her head. </p>
<p>"Not really. Just that you two are close. Although Emory was
saying in Bio class yesterday that you were a little more than close lately but
Lily smacked him with a petrie dish and he shut up real quick, why?" Brooke
winced. She knew that she and Sam were getting a little noticable with their
`friendly' touchy-feely lately and someone was bound to notice. (But Emory Dick?
ARGH) </p>
<p>"Well, we've been meaning to talk to you about that," Brooke
started as she watched Sam pick at her nails and blow a bubble with her gum.
(Oh, gee thanks, Sam) she thought sarcastically, shooting Sam a glare in the
mirror. Sam caught it and immediately joined the conversation. </p>
<p>"Uh, yeah, we uhm, we had Harrison over for dinner the other
night while you were away and told him something that upset him. I mean, MAJORLY
upset him. We thought he was going to have a stroke right there in the kitchen,"
Sam offered as an explaination. Carmen smiled at her friends. </p>
<p>"Gee, Sam, did you cook?" Carmen teased. </p>
<p>"No, Brooke did. I like Harrison and would not inflict my
cooking on him. But that's not why he freaked. I'm telling you, Carm, this was
bad. Worse than I've seen before." </p>
<p>"Come on, it can't be that bad. I'm sure whatever it was,
he'll get over it. He always does. He's Harrison. It's not like you told him you
two were gay and seeing each other," Carmen laughed. Brooke snapped the eyeliner
in her hand in two by accident and Sam choked on her gum. Brooke walked over and
pounded on her back. Sam wondered if one of these days she was going to choke to
death when someone sprung that on her while she was eating. </p>
<p>(First Mom, now Carmen. Between them and Nicole using me for
roadkill, I'd be down to like six lives if I were a cat) the morbid part of her
counted down. </p>
<p>"You OK, Sam?" Carmen asked alarmed. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Fine," she said although her voice was nothing more than a
froggy rasp. (Good thing I don't take choir) Brooke tossed the offending piece
of gum in the trash. </p>
<p>"Wow, Sam, talk about a violent reaction. I thought you and
Brooke were getting along now," Carmen continued. Sam looked at Brooke, her eyes
desperately begging her to handle this one. (I told Harrison, it's your turn)
Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"We are getting along, Carmen. That's just it. We told
Harrison exactly what you just said." Carmen tilted her head to the side as she
tried to follow the conversation. </p>
<p>"Sam's allergic to Double Bubble?" Sam rammed her head into
the wall several times. </p>
<p>"I really wish you wouldn't resort to banging your head into
solid objects like that, Sam. I spent way too long begging you to wake up from
your coma to watch you put yourself into a new one," Brooke sighed at her
girlfriend who gave her a sheepish smile. She pointed to Carmen with an
exasperated look on her face. </p>
<p>"Can you blame me?" Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"Not really," she turned back to Carmen. "No, Carm, the other
part. About Sam and I being gay and seeing each other. Only we aren't just
seeing each other, we are deeply in love with each other. Do you follow?"
</p>
<p>Carmen never actually heard the entire question that Brooke
had asked her, she was all ready passed out on the plush carpeting. </p>
<p>
<font color="#3399FF">Which ends our little flashback&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; </font> </p>
<p>
<br/>
"Do you think we should get someone?" Brooke asked nervously as she watched
Carmen twitch slightly on the floor. Sam looked down from where she calmly sat
on the couch and shook her head. </p>
<p>"Nah, she'll come around in a few minutes. It's kinda funny
though," she laughed. Brooke shot her a dirty look. </p>
<p>"It is not, Sam. She could have hurt herself," Brooke
admonished. Sam looked away, giving the impression she was ashamed, which she
really wasn't. </p>
<p>"Sorry, I just didn't expect her to faint dead away like that.
I mean, come on, Brooke. She was out before she hit the ground. Her eyes rolled
up in her head, down she went and BOOM, right onto the floor. Last time I saw
someone turn that green was when we delivered Mac and I thought you were going
to pass out on me." Brooke stuck out her tongue but could help joining Sam for
the laugh. </p>
<p>"If I recall correctly, you were a little freaked yourself,
Sammy," another thought occurred to her. "If this is any indication, Carm's not
going to take this well," she said sadly. Sam sat up a little further on the
couch and shook her head. </p>
<p>"Apparently not. But look at it this way, at least Harrison
won't have to sit all alone. Or with April Tuna and Freddy Gong. Which is worse
do you suppose? Solitary or eating with those two? If you can eat, that is," she
asked. Brooke gave her another dirty look. </p>
<p>"We're tearing everything, everyone apart," Brooke complained.
Sam got up off the couch and gave Brooke a fierce hug. </p>
<p>"Would you have rather stayed quiet? Or better yet, never
started this relationship at all?" Sam asked in all seriousness. (Please don't
answer that the wrong way. Please don't think we're a mistake!) Sam begged
quietly. Brooke turned around in Sam's arms so that they were nose to nose. She
frowned as she stared into Sam's rich brown eyes, which were clouded with worry
and fear. </p>
<p>"Neither. You?" She watched the worry and fear leave Sam's
eyes to be replaced with joy and relief. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Me either. I finally feel complete when you're in my arms,
Brooke. I wouldn't trade that for anything. And if my friends, our friends can't
accept that or us, then they weren't very good friends to begin with, were
they?" Sam asked as she nuzzled Brooke's cheek. Brooke let out a happy and
contented sigh just as a groan of regaining consciousness came from Carmen. </p>
<p>"Another country heard from," Sam added wryly as Brooke
disconnected from her arms and bent down to the reawakening girl. Carmen opened
her eyes and looked up into Brooke's concerned hazel ones. </p>
<p>"Feeling better, Carm?" Brooke asked gently. Looking from
Brooke to Sam standing a few feet behind her, Carmen promptly fainted again. </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Section 4: Carmen - It Was A Dream And You Were There, And You Were And...">
<p>"I'm just saying, it was getting redundant, Carm. Three times
was more than enough. Try and stay conscious long enough to have the
conversation, please," Sam said annoyed. Brooke swatted her on the shoulder as
she handed a cup of water to Carmen who was seated on the couch. She kept
looking from Brooke to Sam and back like they were little grey space aliens come
to take her away for experimentation and it was beginning to bug the Hell out of
Sam. </p>
<p>"S...sorry," Carmen stuttered, still in a state of shock. She
sipped at the water and continued to stare at Sam and Brooke who were leaned up
against the sink. Sam rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Oh, for Christ's sake, Carm! Hello, still Sam McPherson and
Brooke McQueen over here! Same two people you've known your entire life. That
hasn't changed. Nothing actually has. We just faced the fact that our sexual
preference is for women and oh, gee, look, each other. How convienent for us,
living in the same house and all," Sam huffed. </p>
<p>"Knock it off, Sam," Brooke snapped, fed up with Sam's temper.
Sam glared at her. </p>
<p>"Well, she can at least say SOMETHING," Sam shot back. "At
least Harrison ranted and raved like the little homophobe he is. Lily and Josh
let us know how they felt but she's sitting there like she's afraid she's on the
menu or something." Sam turned her gaze to Carmen. "If you HAVE been talking to
Harrison, the little prick, there's nothing in the drinking water and we're not
going to convert you." She pushed away from the sink and paced around the Novac
like a caged animal while Brooke just rubbed her eyes and sighed. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Carmen spoke up suddenly, making both Sam and
Brooke jump. "You shocked me is all. What do you want me to say, huh? How would
you like it if I dropped a bomb like that on you? You would be at a loss for
words too, you know," she snapped, her voice taking on the same angry tone Sam's
had. </p>
<p>"You know what I'd say? I'd say `are you happy?' Cuz that's
all that matters in the long run," Sam answered curtly. Carmen stood up.
</p>
<p>"That's not all that matters. You're only thinking about
yourselves. Do you even know what you're doing? Do you have any idea what this
is going to do to everybody else?" </p>
<p>"'Everybody else'? What the Hell does it matter what it does
to everybody else? Sam and I are the only ones it should matter to," Brooke
spoke up, surprising Carmen and Sam with the contempt in her voice. </p>
<p>"I am so sick and tired of living with what everyone else
thinks of me and having it hanging over my head, Carmen. Fitting the mold to
make someone else happy. Sam makes me happy. For the first time in my life I
found something that makes me absolutely happy that I don't have to kill myself
or change myself for. She loves me for me and I don't give a flying good God
Damn what that does to everyone else. You got that?" Brooke advanced on Carmen
with a dangerous glint in her eyes making Carmen back away. Sam watched the show
wishing for a bag of popcorn. Or a camcorder. </p>
<p>"If you're going to pull a `Harrison', go right ahead. We went
through that once, it sucked but we can go through it again. I always liked you,
Carmen, you wanna know why? It's because you never judged people. You never
cared what anyone looked like or what they acted like. You like people because
of who they are inside and the Hell with everything else. Well, guess what? I'm
gay! Sam's gay! And we're gay together! And if you can't accept that, well,
there's the door, don't let it hit you in the ass on the way out!" </p>
<p>Carmen stared back at her for a few minutes in stunned silence
at the tirade from the normally serene and sociable cheerleader and then looked
over at Sam, her former best friend, who shrugged back at her. </p>
<p>"But.but it's wrong," Carmen whispered. Sam sighed in defeat. </p>
<p>"You didn't say that when it was Harrison's mom," she said
patiently as she walked over to Brooke and rubbed the still upset girl's back
soothingly. "And I've got to wonder, how can any love like this be wrong? You
don't know how we feel about each other, Carm, you couldn't possibly understand.
My Mom has given us her blessing and for now, that's enough. Lily and Josh are
OK with us and showed us what true friends really are. Can you say the same?"
Carmen shook her head. </p>
<p>"I don't.I don't know," she said softly. And she really
didn't. This was a lot to take in all at once. (These two used to hate each
other and now they love each other?) She was baffled. (The sky is still blue
right? What goes up must come down and Sam and Brooke love each other.one of
these things doesn't go with the natural order of the universe) </p>
<p>"Honesty is a good place to start," Brooke said having
regained control of her normal voice. "Take the time you need Carmen, we want
you as a friend but if that isn't possible, we understand. But please, keep this
between us, OK? Until we tell everyone ourselves?" Carmen nodded. </p>
<p>"I can give you that much," Carmen admitted. "I have to go,"
she said as she left the Novac. Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"I'm really starting to dread these little heart to hearts
with our friends," she complained. Sam kissed her and held her close.
</p>
<p>"Just think, we have Nicole and Mary Cherry, Sugar and then,
and we saved the best for last, Mike left." </p>
<p>"That's not helpful," Brooke warned. </p>
<p>"I know. I'm not sure I'm built for all this emotional trauma.
On the bright side, at least when we tell Nicole, she can't try to run us over
again," Sam chirped. Brooke groaned. </p>
<p>"Do me a favor, Sam? When you become a writer, don't go into
comedy." </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Section 4: Carmen - Oops You Did It Again">
<p>"Josh, man, can I talk to you?" Sugar Daddy asked Josh as he
passed him in the hall. Josh looked at his friend who was an alarming shade of
pale. </p>
<p>"Sure, man, what's up?" Sugar looked up and down the hall and
once he was sure they were alone, leaned in closer to Josh. </p>
<p>"I was walking down the hall and I passed the girls bathroom,
yo, and I heard some yelling. It sounded like Sam and Brooke so I stopped to
listen, just ta make sure they weren't killing each other, you know?" Sugar went
on. </p>
<p>(Uh-oh) Josh moaned to himself. He didn't like where this was
going. </p>
<p>"Anyway," Sugar continued, getting a little more agitated.
"Then I heard Carmen's voice and yo, they were really all going at it and I
heard some stuff that can't possibly be true." Josh rolled his eyes. </p>
<p>(Why me?) </p>
<p>"What did you hear, Shug?" Josh asked patiently. </p>
<p>"Yo, I don't know how you're going to take this seeing as how
Brooke's you're ex and all but Brooke and Sam are like illicit lovers, yo. As in
secret paramours." Josh sighed. </p>
<p>"I thought we agreed that you'd stop reading those romance
novels, Shug," Sugar blushed. </p>
<p>"I only read them for the pick up lines, man. You're missing
the point here, Josh. Brooke and Sam are together! As in to-get-her." Josh
sighed again. </p>
<p>"Are they still in the Novac?" Sugar shrugged. </p>
<p>"Sam and Brooke are, I think. Carmen just left. Why?"
</p>
<p>"Wait here," Josh went to the Novac, knocked and went in. He
emerged a few minutes later with Sam and Brooke. Sugar's male teenage mind noted
how their hair was mussed and they didn't seem at all happy to see him.
</p>
<p>"Sam, Brooke, do you have something to tell Sugar?" Both girls
rolled their eyes and sighed. </p>
<p>"We're involved with each other," they said in unison. They
watched as Sugar's eyes got impossibly wide. </p>
<p>"It's true, yo?" They nodded. "And you knew, Josh?"
</p>
<p>"They told Lily and me a few nights ago," Josh explained. </p>
<p>"And you're OK with that?" Sugar asked, still looking at the
two girls in wonder. Josh nodded. </p>
<p>"As long as they're happy, what business is it of mine?" Sugar
considered this seriously. </p>
<p>"Are you two happy?" Both girls smiled widely. </p>
<p>"Very," Sam answered as she put her arm around Brooke.
</p>
<p>"Absolutely," Brooke responded, wrapping her arm around Sam.
Sugar smiled at them. </p>
<p>"Cool with me then. Who wants to go get a pizza?" </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Section 5: Nicole - Catharsis">
<p>"I'm not gonna tell her, you tell her." </p>
<p>"Me? She's your friend, not mine." </p>
<p>"Oh, no, that's the coward's way out, Sam. No fair using
that," Brooke informed her squirming girlfriend. "Hold still will you, I'm
almost done." </p>
<p>"You said that ten minutes ago, Brooke. Besides, she IS your
friend, or at least was until that whole `I'm going to run you down with my car'
thing," Sam shifted slightly, making the bathwater splash. "Oops, sorry. Anyway,
now you barely tolerate her. But that's no reason to send me into the lion's
den. I AM the one she ran down after all." Sam didn't miss the flash of regret
and pain that flew across Brooke's hazel eyes before she could mask it. And had
she not been in a slippery tub with her girlfriend, she would have kicked
herself for the comment. </p>
<p>"Brooke," Sam said softly from across the tub, "You're either
going to have to deal with it, or let it go. Soon. It happened. Nothing you or I
can do is going to change it." Brooke dropped her gaze from Sam's and looked
into bubbles surrounding them. </p>
<p>"Sam, please," she begged quietly. Sam wagged her toes in
Brooke's face. </p>
<p>"Hey, leg needs finishing shaving here," she said indicating
the calf Brooke currently was holding. "Or are you going to slit my ankle with
that Lady Bic?" Brooke glared at her and Sam went back to the subject at hand. </p>
<p>"Look, love," she started patiently as Brooke took another
light swipe at the back of her calf. It tickled and she had to surpress a small
giggle. She was, after all, trying to be serious for a change. "It's been months
and aside from a barely noticable limp and some faded scars, it's over and done
with. Why can't you let it go?" Brooke shrugged while she concentrated on one of
those scars Sam was talking about on Sam's right ankle. She knew every inch of
Sam's body intimately now and while she tried not to think about it often, the
scars were a roadmap of memories chronicling every moment of that awful night
and how far Sam had come as well as how much pain Sam had been through.
</p>
<p>"I try to, Sammy," she answered finally. "But every now and
then, when I look at or think about Nicole, I see you in that hospital bed,
hooked up to those machines and the feelings come rushing back." Tears splashed
down from Brooke's face into the bathwater. Sam pulled her leg away and leaned
across the tub to hold the crying girl. </p>
<p>"Survivor's guilt's a bitch, I know," Sam said soothingly as
she stroked Brooke's damp hair out of her face. Brooke looked at her confused.
"I felt it for a long time after my Dad died. I was afraid to be happy because
he wasn't here. How could I be happy when he was dead? It didn't seem right, or
fair," Brooke listened intently to the important words Sam was telling her. </p>
<p>"And you feel it partially because you feel that that whole
night was your fault. I got hit by that car by pushing you out of the way. Some
silly part of your brain keeps telling you that it should have been you who
suffered. But it wasn't Brooke, it was me. And I have told you a hundred, a
million times that it wasn't your fault and I don't blame you. And I will tell
you a milion more if that's what it takes but please, please love, stop blaming
yourself or at least go easy. It's been eating you up inside off and on all this
time and I hate to watch you do this," Sam was crying now too. Brooke reached up
with sudsy hands and brushed the tears away. </p>
<p>"We're a pair aren't we?" Brooke asked though her tears as Sam
settled against her. Sam nodded. "OK, we'll both tell her, but no jokes about
running anyone over. Everytime you say it, I relive it." Sam swallowed the sob
of guilt that rushed up at the statement. </p>
<p>"OK," she managed to choke out past her guilt. If she were to
tell the truth, she couldn't close her eyes without seeing the damned thing
herself still. She still woke in a cold sweat sometimes although she was getting
better about not waking Brooke if she was there with her. </p>
<p>"You OK, Sam?" Brooke asked, worried at the sudden silence of
her tubmate. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Fine," Sam lied. Brooke gave her a dubious look. "We'd better
get out before we prune," she said to deflect the attention from herself. She
stood up and stepped out of the tub, holding out another towel for Brooke once
she was ready. She wrapped the towel around the taller frame and then proceeded
to dry the blonde's hair with another. Brooke purred at the attention.
</p>
<p>"So, your room or mine?" </p>
<p>"Brooke, `rentals," Sam reminded her. Brooke huffed at her. </p>
<p>"Are at the a reunion in Fresno all weekend. Mac is at a
babysitter's. You have a memory like a cheese grate, full of holes," Brooke
teased. Sam frowned. </p>
<p>"Keep that up and you'll be sleeping alone, Princess," she
threatened. Brooke pretended to look horrified. </p>
<p>"Eeeek, the horror!" she squealed, making Sam burst out
laughing. Sam finished drying Brooke's hair and pulled her into a burning kiss.
Brooke let go of the towel covering her body and let it fall to the floor. Sam
pulled out of the kiss and arched an eyebrow. </p>
<p>"Is that an invitation?" Sam asked huskily as she drank in the
sight of Brooke. Brooke just nodded and reached out to pull at Sam's towel. Sam
stepped just out of reach and shook her head. "Ah, ah, ah…no naughty touchy for
Brookie just yet," she chided. Brooke stuck her bottom lip out in a pout.
</p>
<p>"Oh no you don't. Even the sexy pout isn't going to work this
time," Sam wagged her finger at Brooke. </p>
<p>"Why not?" Brooke almost whined. A wicked smile that made
Brooke's blood boil spread across Sam's face. </p>
<p>"My turn first," Sam said with a glint of teeth. Brooke smiled
back and happily followed Sam into her room. </p>

a sex scene and hated it, sue me) </font> </p>
<p><br/>
"I love you, you know," Brooke said after Sam opened her eyes and focused them
on her. Sam smiled at her lopsidedly. </p>
<p>"I love you too," she whispered, closing her eyes and leaning
in for a kiss. "I hope you understand how much," she continued as she brushed
some stray strands of blonde hair way from Brooke's eyes. </p>
<p>"I do," Brooke reassured her confidently. Sam grinned at her
widely. </p>
<p>"Just to be sure, let me show you." </p>
<center>
<p>** </p>
</center>
<p>Sam looked down at the blonde head resting on her bare chest
hours later and watched the hand that traced the light scars on her ribcage. She
sometimes wondered what Brooke thought about while she did that. (Do the scars
bother her? Is she thinking about the accident again?) </p>
<p>"Penny for `em, Princess," Sam whispered. Brooke shifted
slightly so that she could look in Sam's eyes but not have to lift her head. </p>
<p>"Just listening to your heartbeat," Brooke answered simply, a
hint of sadness and longing in her voice. Sam's eyes smiled although she frowned
slightly. </p>
<p>"Still there I trust?" Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"It's a very beautiful sound, Sammy. I was once so afraid that
it would stop," she trailed off, tears choking off her voice. Sam stroked
Brooke's hair with one hand and ran her other one down Brooke's back.
</p>
<p>"Takes a licking and keeps on ticking," Sam joked, needing to
lighten the mood before she lost control of her own emotions. Brooke shook her
head without lifting it, making her hair brush against Sam's chest and making
her shiver. </p>
<p>"You don't understand," Brooke looked away. "The thought of
telling Nic about us has made me rethink the whole accident thing. There were
nights in the hospital when the only sound I had for company was the beeping of
your heart monitor. And it scared me that you were reduced to a series of bleeps
and whistles. Did anyone tell you that that sound stopped? Twice?" Sam felt hot
tears burn the skin between her breasts as Brooke cried. </p>
<p>"No," she replied honestly, scared at the thought. That was
news to her. Brooke snuggled closer to her, if that was possible, still keeping
her ear pressed to Sam's heart. </p>
<p>"Your heart stopped twice, Sammy, and I thought I had lost you
forever without ever telling you how I really felt," Brooke continued, her voice
now nothing more than a raspy whisper. </p>
<p>"But it started again," Sam reminded her calmly. Brooke could
hear the way Sam's heart had sped up at hearing the news though and knew Sam
wasn't half as calm as she acted. </p>
<p>"Only after the doctors and nurses poked you with needles and
drugs and used those paddles on you. God, Sam, it was scary and nothing like you
see on TV. I thought you were dead," Brooke was sobbing now and Sam could do
nothing but hold on to her. </p>
<p>"Why didn't anyone tell me?" Sam asked after Brooke calmed
down some. Brooke shrugged, still not moving from her vigil over Sam's heart. </p>
<p>"It doesn't really fit into many conversations. `Welcome back
from your coma, Sam. You're paralyzed from the waist down, but it might be
temporary, you can't speak, also temporary, and oh yeah, you died twice. Nice
recovery'. You see how it lends itself to awkwardness? Besides, you did recover
and we figured the less you knew the better. But sometimes, when no one was
around, I'd crawl into your hospital bed and put my head on your chest just to
make sure." </p>
<p>"Like this?" Sam asked with a smile. Brooke nodded.
</p>
<p>"Like this," Brooke answered. "And then I could sleep again
knowing you were all right." Sam brushed away her own tears that had fallen. </p>
<p>"That's very sweet, Brooke. You took very good care of me.
Still do, actually." Brooke smiled at her, her eyes lighting up like blue
sapphires in the pale moonlight. </p>
<p>"Thank you, Sammy. That means a lot. I tried so hard to take
good care of you," she yawned. "And I still want to keep you safe. That's why
I'm afraid to tell Nicole." </p>
<p>"Afraid she'll pull another jealous drunken bender number?"
Sam asked, not a hint of humor in her voice, only genuine concern. She was
worried Nicole might go ballistic on them too. Having Nic flip and target one of
them was not something she wanted to live through again. If she was lucky enough
to live through it again, that is. Besides, watching Harrison and Carmen freak
and shun them was enough. And there was still Mike to consider. Telling him was
no doubt going to be anything but fun. Brooke nodded and yawned again.
</p>
<p>"Yup," Brooke said quietly and Sam could tell she was drifting
off. Sam placed a small kiss on the top of Brooke's head and listened as her
breathing became deep and even. </p>
<p>"Sleep, Princess," Sam whispered to the sleeping form who was
still situated over her heart. "I'll keep you safe tonight." </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Section 5: Nicole - Time Flys, Why Don't You Go Find It?">
<p>"What's up, B?" Nicole asked at school the next day and
watched as Brooke jumped about three feet straight up in the air without bending
at the knees first. (Pretty impressive feat, reminds me of a cat) Nicole thought
dryly, while Brooke waited for her heart to restart itself. </p>
<p>"Jesus, Nic, do I need to put a bell around your neck or
what?" Brooke asked as her heart finally slowed its frantic pace. Nic arched an
eyebrow. </p>
<p>"As long as it's a Prada or Gucci bell and not a cowbell, I'll
think about it," Nic responded. "Too much caffine in your cappachino this
morning or what, B?" Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, just a little jumpy, that's all," Brooke shot back. </p>
<p>"Brooke, I've seen people with Post-Tramatic Stress Disorder
in a warzone less jumpy than you are right now. I know we aren't as close as we
once were, if we actually ever were close. And I know that trying to kill a
person tends to put a strain on your relationship but, you can talk to me, you
know?" Nic offered sincerely. And she was sincere. Of all the backs she would
still willingly and gladly stab to get ahead, Brooke and Sam's weren't anywhere
in her Mike Myers (think Halloween, not Austin Powers) stabbing range. (Enough
damage was done there, thank you. Now, if Mary Cherry doesn't learn to keep B.
Ho the Hell away from me) Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Thanks, I may need to take you up on that," Nicole's eyes lit
up at this. Not in the formally evil, oh-I'm-gonna-sink-you-with-this-information
way that they used to but with a you're-going-to-trust-me? sort of happy way. </p>
<p>"Sam and I want to talk to you, actually," Brooke continued.
Now, the formally evil side of Nicole would have cringed at this and then had a
bitchy comment at spending time with Spam McPherson. But now she was just happy
that they were both still willing to speak to her. (And not chase me around with
garden tools to carve out my insides) </p>
<p>"Well, I'm free after school today, if that's OK with you
two," Nicole offered. Brooke nodded absently. </p>
<p>"Yeah, come by the Palace. Mom and Dad are away so we can talk
without interruption. Around four?" Nicole nodded and smiled. </p>
<p>"Wouldn't miss it." </p>
<center>
<p>**</p>
</center>
<p>"Stop pacing, you're making me nervous," Sam asked her frantic
girlfriend who was currently wearing an interesting pattern in the carpeting. It
was quarter to four and as it got closer to the agreed on time, Brooke was
getting more and more worked up. Sam was starting to worry that the poor girl
was going to give herself a stroke. </p>
<p>"How can you not be nervous? This is Nicole Julian. Miss `I'm
pissed off, let's get drunk and run down my best friend' herself. And that time
she was upset over what I told George about her. Now I'm about to tell her that
I'm gay and I'm in love with you! You know she's not your biggest fan," Brooke
warned. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"I think I figured that out somewhere between freshman year
and the sound of tires screeching," Sam answered absently without thinking.
Brooke stopped her pacing. </p>
<p>"Saaaamm," she wailed, half-angry, half in pain. Sam shot up
out of the armchair and enveloped her in a strong hug. </p>
<p>"Sorry," she whispered in Brooke's ear. "Open mouth, disengage
brain. Typical Sam. I'm sorry." Brooke relaxed in her arms. </p>
<p>"S'OK," Brooke told her. She rested her head on Sam's shoulder
and thanked God for what felt like the millionth time that she still had Sam in
her life. She stayed like that, wrapped in Sam's warm, strong arms until the
doorbell rang and she reluctantly untangled herself from the only place she
truly felt safe anymore. She stared into Sam's mahogany brown eyes. </p>
<p>"Ready?" Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"When you are, love," Sam answered with a half smile. After
giving her a quick kiss, Brooke answered the door. Nicole walked in and spared
Sam a small smile, which Sam returned. It struck Sam odd that Nicole seemed
nervous. </p>
<p>"What's up, twinkies? Need fashion advice, Spam? Because I've
told you that that shirt and pants don't go," Sam looked at her outfit and
frowned. As she was about to get annoyed, she heard the small giggle bubble
forth from Nicole. </p>
<p>"I swear, Sam, you are such an easy mark," Nicole laughed.
Most of the tension eased in the room at the joke although Brooke still felt a
bit anxious. </p>
<p>"Ha ha, very funny, Nicole," Sam snickered sarcastically. "Did
you come all this way to poke fun at the fashionally challenged or are you here
for a reason?" </p>
<p>"Brooke invited me, sort of. Didn't you know?" Nicole asked
nervously, looking from Brooke to Sam like she'd been set up for something. Sam
smiled evilly. </p>
<p>"Now who's the easy mark, Nic? Relax," Sam continued when she
saw the hint of fear creep up into Nic's eyes and realized she'd inadvertantly
scared the shorter blonde. "We just wanted to talk." </p>
<p>"Oh, OK. Thought for a second there you were going to go all
`Bully' on me," Nic confessed as she plopped down on the couch. "Whatcha wanna
talk about?" </p>
<p>"Nicole, this is kind of hard for us, and we want you to hear
us out," Sam started when Brooke could only manage to open and close her mouth
like a guppy stranded on land. If it weren't such a serious conversation, Sam
would have laughed at the sight. </p>
<p>"Sam, I think after the Hell I put the two of you and your
family through, and the fact that of all people you extended an olive branch to
me, which you didn't turn around and try to stake me through the heart with, the
least I can do for you is listen to you. Whatever you two have to say I'll
listen. I'm no where near redemption yet, so, lay it on me," Nic said, meaning
every word. Brooke sat down on the couch and Sam sat on the arm of it beside her
with her hand on Brooke's shoulder. The little gesture didn't go unnoticed by
Nicole. She arched her eyebrow again but said nothing. </p>
<p>"Nic, things have changed around here. I mean really changed,"
Brooke started, hating herself for her vagueness. Nicole nodded. </p>
<p>"Yeah, so? Plaid is out, mini's are back, so what else?" </p>
<p>"I don't think you're following me. I mean with me and Sam.
Things have changed with me and Sam. Between us," Brooke continued before she
faltered and looked up at her girlfriend. </p>
<p>"Did you take a `vague pill' before she came over?" Sam asked
her. Brooke sighed and put her head in her hands and sighed again. Sam looked at
Nicole with a sad look on her face. </p>
<p>"What Miss Articulation 2001 is trying, and failing miserably
I might add, to say is since my recovery our relationship has changed. It's
deepened. We discovered that we had unrequited feelings for each other that
were, well, requited." Nicole looked at her blankly. Now Sam sighed. (Gee, that
helped) </p>
<p>"OK, maybe I'm overarticulating. Nic, Brooke and I are in love
with one another and are involved in a loving, romantic and fulfilling
relationship. There, I said it." Sam slid off the arm of the couch onto the
couch itself next to Brooke and the two of them watched for a reaction from the
short blonde known for her explosive outbursts. Nicole blinked a few times
before speaking. </p>
<p>"You're gay?" Nicole asked with a confused frown. Both girls
nodded. "As in a Melissa Etheridge/Tammy Lynn Michaels sort of gay?" <br/>
<font color="#3399FF">{A/N:sorry, couldn't resist =)} </font> </p>
<p>"Yes," Sam responded firmly. Nicole nodded slowly, frown still
in place and still looking confused. </p>
<p>"Oh." </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Section 5: Nicole - And Behind Door Number 3…">
<p>It had been ten minutes since Nicole had uttered her one sound
and no one had moved. Brooke wasn't sure anyone besides herself was still
breathing. If it weren't for the slight rise and fall of Sam's chest, she would
have been worried about her. As it was, she was worried about the shock still
form of her former best friend sitting across from her. Nicole hadn't moved an
inch. Brooke wasn't sure the girl had blinked in the space of time since Sam had
finished speaking. She was still staring straight ahead, apparently unseeing.
Brooke was waiting for her to shoot across the space between them and wrap her
arms around Sam's neck to try and finish the job she started with her car or
something equally horrible. </p>
<p>"Uhm, Nic?" Brooke finally spoke, unable to take the harsh
silence anymore. "Are you OK?" Nicole tore her eyes from whatever faraway point
they'd been at and focused them at the couple in front of her. She blinked at
them for a few more minutes, still not speaking. Brooke shifted in Sam's arms,
nervous. </p>
<p>"Earth to Nicole," Sam spoke up, sensing and agreeing with
Brooke's nervousness. Nicole was getting spooky. And that was a very scary
thing. "Can you speak or have you had a stroke? Do you smell burning toast?"
Brooke elbowed her in the ribs. </p>
<p>"Knock off the jokes, Sam, she's really freaked," Brooke
hissed. </p>
<p>"At least she didn't faint three times like Carmen," Sam
pointed out calmly. "No need to get all worked up yet Brooke, she hasn't reacted
yet." </p>
<p>"Carmen fainted three times?" Nicole asked quietly, startling
both the girls by finally speaking. She wasn't looking at either of them anymore
but instead seemed more interested in studying the condition of her Prada heels.
(Hmm…toe's scuffed, can't have that. Need a new pair) </p>
<p>"Out cold on the floor of the Novac," Sam piped up, glad that
the girl had remembered how to speak at last. Nicole looked up at them again and
they were surprised to see the fear on Nicole's face. Disgust, outrage or
repulsion they were prepared for but fear? (What the heck is she afraid of?)
Brooke wondered. </p>
<p>"That's surprising. I would have thought she would have
supported you," Nicole said, her voice still soft. </p>
<p>"She and Harrison have some issues to work out about it,"
Brooke confessed sadly. She missed Carmen and Harrison's company and knew Sam
did as well. And now she was worried about what Nicole was going to do.
</p>
<p>"Who else knows?" Nicole asked, again looking away, studying
the room instead. Sam and Brooke exchanged wary glances. This was way too calm
to be the real Nicole Julian. (Would the real Nicole Julian please stand up?)
Sam laughed to herself hearing the notes from the Eminem song. </p>
<p>"Mom, and Lily and Josh. Sugar found out by accident. They all
took it really well, Sugar even took us out to dinner," Brooke told her. Nicole
nodded. </p>
<p>"That's good," she said absently. </p>
<p>"What about you, Nic?" Sam asked, getting right to the point.
Nicole focused her blue eyes on her. "What are you going to do about this now?
Are you going to try and use this against us, try and hurt Brooke and her
popularity with it? I can't possibly get anymore unpopular aside from sitting
with April Tuna and Freddy Gong and Harrison and Carmen have beaten me to that.
You know there's nothing you can do to hurt me with it," She watched the flash
of hurt that went across Nicole's eyes and it surprised her. </p>
<p>"I wondered why they were lowering themselves further on the
food chain lately. Anyway, I deserved that, Sam, and yes, at one time, I
probably would have jumped at this little tidbit of info to use it was a way of
leapfrogging my way to the top of the social ladder and to Hell with anyone's
feelings." </p>
<p>"But now?" Brooke asked. Nicole shrugged. </p>
<p>"Now? Now who you chose to love is no one's business but your
own. What goes on behind closed doors is your business, not the general populace
of Kennedy High School." She looked at the two shocked faces before her and
laughed. "So no, I'm not going to go parading around the halls tomorrow singing
`Brooke and Sammy sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g' at the top of my lungs. It'd
be rude and tasteless, not to mention I have the worst singing voice," she
continued with a small smile. Brooke let out a sigh of utter relief that was
echoed by Sam. </p>
<p>"But how do you feel about it, Nic?" Brooke asked. "We know
how everyone else, except Mary Cherry, feels, good and bad. Now we want your
opinion." </p>
<p>"Not your blessing," Sam clarified. Nicole nodded. </p>
<p>"I'm not going to go screaming from the room like you suddenly
ordered me to wear last years Jacklyn Smith fashions, hon, if that's what you
mean. So your sexual preference doesn't qualify as `norm'. Big deal. Neither
does my hair color." Everyone laughed at this. </p>
<p>"So you're not freaked?" Brooke asked. </p>
<p>"I didn't say that. The thought that my best friend and the
biggest pain in my ass play tonsil hockey and probably get horizontal on a
regular basis," she paused and looked at the two blushing girls, "and those
blushes tell me way more than I need to know. But as I was saying, the thought
alone is enough to disturb me and make me wonder about the natural order of the
universe but, a lot of shit makes me do that lately. No big." She looked at the
two smiles that looked back at her. </p>
<p>"I take it you're happy with my answer?" </p>
<p>"Given that we've already lost two good friends and expected
to have you flip out on us, we're pleasantly surprised, Nic," Brooke said, still
grinning. Sam nodded her agreement. </p>
<p>"Yeah, well, I'm working on the whole freaking out and running
around and trying to kill people problem I used to have" Nicole said wryly. Sam
looked at Brooke with a (See? I'm not the only one who makes bad jokes about it)
look on her face that won her a smack on the arm. </p>
<p>"Wow, this really is a whole new you, Nicole," Brooke pointed
out amazed. Nicole shrugged. </p>
<p>"Well, if I've learned anything, it's that you have to take
love and acceptance where you can find it. One of the reasons I acted the way I
did for so long is because I didn't get any love at home and mistook fear and
worship for it. But if you two found it with each other, good for you. And I
want you as friends and this is part of the package, OK, I can deal."
</p>
<p>"That is so mature," Sam said in disbelief, she just couldn't
believe these words were coming from the same Nicole Julian who had made her
life such a living Hell for so long. And she wasn't even thinking about the
whole accident thing. </p>
<p>"Yeah, a real kick in the ass, ain't it? It's amazing what
therapy can do for a person. Anyway, I just hope you feel the same way. Because,
if you're going to be so honest with me, I have to be honest with you," Nic said
seriously. Sam looked at Brooke and shrugged. </p>
<p>"OK, Nic, what's up?" Brooke asked. Nicole leaned forward and
rested her hands on her knees as she stared intently at the two girls in front
of her. The spark of unfamiliar fear was back in her eyes. </p>
<p>"I don't know how to tell you this, Brooke, Sam, but I'm going
to be honest and just say it. I've come to terms with the fact that I'm
bisexual," Nicole confessed in a rush, just to get the words out of her mouth
before she chickened out completely. She looked at Sam who was still staring at
her, one eyebrow trying to climb up off her forehead. Sam turned away a few
seconds later to check on the prone form of Brooke who had fainted dead away on
the couch beside her right after Nicole had finished speaking. After making sure
Brooke was OK, Sam turned back to Nicole with a smirk on her face. Nicole looked
even more slightly panicked. </p>
<p>"I think you broke her." (Maybe there is something in the
drinking water because this is going to kill Harrison) </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Section 6: Mary Cherry - Two Tickets For The Express Train To Hell, Please">
<p>"Oh mah Gawd! Oh mah Gawd! Oh mah Gawd! Oh mah Gawd! Oh mah Gawd!" Mary
Cherry exclaimed. Sam leaned over to whisper into Brooke's ear as they once
again found themselves playing out the great drama of their lives in the Novak.</p>
<p>"Is she praying for us, blessing us or damning us?" she asked dumbfounded.
Brooke shook her head slowly never removing her eyes from the kneeling form of
Mary Cherry who was still repeating those three words like a mantra. </p>
<p>"Oh mah Gawd! Oh mah Gawd! Oh mah Gawd! Oh mah Gawd! Oh mah Gawd!" </p>
<p>"I have no idea," Brooke whispered back with a frown. They both continued to
stare at the girl on the floor in front of them. Sam turned to Brooke to face
her. </p>
<p>"I've lost count, how many 'Oh my God's' is that?" Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"Three, four hundred?" Brooke answered looking back at Sam. Sam seemed to
consider this for a minute and then turned to Mary Cherry. </p>
<p>"If she hasn't answered you by now, Mary Cherry, she must be busy doing
something else. Now stand up and talk to us like a normal human being," she
stopped to ponder her words. She looked at Brooke. "Or whatever passes for
'normal' for Mary Cherry." </p>
<p>Mary Cherry suddenly stopped her chanting and sprang to her feet in one bound
reminding both Sam and Brooke of a Jack-in-the-Box. Sam could actually hear the
strains of 'Pop goes the weasel' in her head. Mary Cherry's eyes narrowed and
she pointed an accusing finger at them both. </p>
<p>"Y'all know what ya are? Y'all are evil. EEE-VEEELLLL!!!" Mary Cherry
shrieked. </p>
<p>"It speaks," Sam said dryly as Brooke shot her a dirty look and approached
Mary Cherry, palms out in the universal sign of peace. Mary Cherry backed away
and raised her purse as if to strike her. Brooke stopped and backtracked until
she was hidden slightly behind Sam who looked between the two of them in
confusion. Brooke pointed to the purse and Sam's eyes got wide. She knew what
Mary Cherry carried in that bag. Or was rumored to at least. She took a step
back as well, Brooke still behind her. </p>
<p>"Now, Mary Cherry, just calm down. There's no need for violence," Sam said
calmly, hoping to avoid bloodshed, most notably hers and Brooke's. Mary Cherry
waved the purse at them threateningly. </p>
<p>"Evil," she repeated. "There's a word fer it, y'all. It's in-cese." Sam burst
out laughing making Mary Cherry and Brooke jump. Sam looked at Brooke who was
now crouched behind her. </p>
<p>"Incense, get it? Incense?" Brooke tried to hide the smile to no effect. Mary
Cherry rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Ah know it's INCEST," she pronounced the word slowly and perfectly in
generic middle American english. "Don't be mockin' mah accent Sam-in-a-Can." Her
eyes narrowed further. "An' it's wrong, y'all. Just wrong. Y'all're goin' ta
Hell. It's against the Bible. It says a man shall not lie down wit' another
man." </p>
<p>"Then we're fine, neither of us is a man," Sam pointed out flatly. Mary
Cherry started to turn an alarming shade of red. Brooke hit Sam on the back. </p>
<p>"You're not helping," she hissed. Sam craned her neck to look at Brooke. </p>
<p>"Neither are you," Sam hissed back. "I know you like my ass but stop using it
as your personal shield and get out here, she's your friend, not mine." Brooke
sighed and stepped out from the safety of Sam's back to face Mary Cherry. </p>
<p>"Technically, Mary Cherry, it's not incest since we're not actually sisters.
There's no blood relation between us," Brooke explained simply. Mary Cherry
shook her head. </p>
<p>"Ah saw this ehgzact thing on Jerry just a few months ago," she started. </p>
<p>"Rikki," Sam broke in. Mary Cherry tilted her head confused. Sam thought she
resembled a constipated poodle. </p>
<p>"Huh?" </p>
<p>"Rikki Lake, you saw it on Rikki Lake," Sam clarified. Mary Cherry nodded.
</p>
<p>"Whatever, y'all. As Ah wuz sayin', she did this whole show on stepsisters
who were illicit lovers an' how it tore the fam'lies apart," Mary Cherry droned
on. Sam and Brooke exchanged tired looks. </p>
<p>"Mary Cherry, your point?" Brooke asked curtly. Mary Cherry glared. </p>
<p>"Y'all have earned yerselves one way tickets on the express train ta Hell,
that's mah point, Brookie. First class tickets, too." </p>
<p>"Christ, whatever," Sam mumbled, so not impressed by Mary Cherry's rantings.
Mary Cherry turned her attentions on Sam. </p>
<p>"What did y'all do to her? What lil' ol' spell did you put on poor ol'
Brookie ta turn her all gay, Spammie?" Sam looked at Mary Cherry like her head
had fallen off. </p>
<p>"What? How? What?" Sam sputtered. She put her hands on her cheeks and stared
flabbergasted through her fingers at Mary Cherry. </p>
<p>"You heard me, Sammie McQueerson, whaud ya do ta her ta make her become a
lez-be-ee-in-in-trainin'?" What started as a giggle grew into hysterical
laughter for Sam as she looked at Brooke for help. Brooke just shrugged. She had
NO idea what to say to that. She also had no idea what Sam found so damn funny.
</p>
<p>"Did ya slip a mickey in her protein drink?" Mary Cherry continued as Sam
slid to the floor, the hysterical laughter overwhelming her and making tears
slide down her face. Mary Cherry advanced on her until Brooke stood in her way.
</p>
<p>"Outta mah way, Brookie, this is between me an' Sammy McRainbow over there.
Think this is funny,huh? Well, Ah don't. Up until recently, Brookie wuz straight
as an arrow an' then you come along battin' yer big Bambi brown eyez at 'er an'
the next thing Ah know she's playin' fer the other team. Ya musta dun sumthin'
to her," Mary Cherry explained. Brooke sighed as Sam kept laughing, holding her
sides. Brooke didn't know what was worse, Mary Cherry's ranting or Sam's
laughing. </p>
<p>"Sam didn't do anything to me, Mary Cherry. No spells, no drugs, nothing. I'm
gay, not straight and I love her. Please stop laughing Sam, you're not helping."
Sam snorted at her and Brooke rolled her eyes. "Fine, whatever. Mary Cherry,
we're not evil, we're not committing incest and we're not going to Hell. OK?"
Sam hiccuped signifing the end of her laughing fit and stood back up. Brooke
shot her a dirty look. </p>
<p>"You done?" Sam smiled sheepishly as she wiped away the last of the laughter
induced tears. </p>
<p>"Yeah," hiccup, "sorry." </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Section 6: Mary Cherry - People In Glass Houses...Break A Lot Of Windows">
<p>"It's wrong and amoral and depraved and morally wrong and reprehensible..."
Mary Cherry continued fifteen minutes later as she paced and Brooke and Sam sat
on the couch in the Novak watching. </p>
<p>"I think she just used her allowance of big words for the year," Sam yawned.
Brooke leaned her head on Sam's shoulder and sighed. (If she's reacting this
badly to us, her head'll explode if she ever found out about Nic) </p>
<p>"Let her get it out of her system now and maybe she won't do something
outrageous with it later," she suggested. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Let's hope so," Sam agreed. </p>
<p>You know, I think we would have been better off gathering everyone into a
room and telling them all at once rather than one at a time," Brooke said in
hindsight. "At least we'd be done by now." Sam smirked. </p>
<p>"True. We could have dropped the bomb and ran and let them all fight it out
amongst themselves. Can you see it? Carmen, Mary Cherry and Harrison vs. Lily,
Josh, Nicole, and Sugar? Man, I'd pay to see that Royal Rumble," Sam laughed.
Brooke giggled at the imagery. </p>
<p>"We could charge on Pay-per-View," Brooke joked. Sam looked down at Brooke
with a shocked look on her face. </p>
<p>"Careful, I think my sense of humor is wearing off on you," she warned.
Brooke looked suitably frightened. </p>
<p>"We're in trouble if that ever happens," she agreed. Mary Cherry suddenly
turned and approached Brooke with an angry (angrier?) look on her face. </p>
<p>"Do y'all have any idear what this is gonna do ta all the lil' Brookie
worshippies out thar? They'll all either convert ta gayism er decide that y'all
ain't cool no more an' then we'll all be unpopular like Spammie McPride over
thar," she declared. Sam swallowed the anger that was starting to bubble from
the stupid names Mary Cherry was calling her. (I will not stoop to her level, I
won't) Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"Her name is Sam McPherson, Mary Cherry. Either call her Sam or don't say her
name at all," obviously Brooke was bothered by it too. Mary Cherry glared at
her. </p>
<p>"Whatever. Are ya listening ta me at all, Brookie? Y'all are gonna destroy us
all," Mary Cherry pointed out. It was like a distorted echo of Carmen's
sentiments a few days earlier. (Very distorted, Funhouse distorted, echo) Brooke
put her face in her hands and softly started to cry, more out of frustration
than anything else. Sam rubbed her back for a minute and then let her anger get
the better of her and stood up to face the still irate Texan. </p>
<p>"All right, my turn you ignorant, Bible-thumping, axe-murdering, anal
retentive little twit!" she exploded, surprising even herself with the force
behind her voice. Brooke looked up to watch, not about to miss this show. </p>
<p>"First off, what Brooke and I have is no one's business but our own. It's
pure and good and real and not in anyway, shape or form evil. It is love, pure
and simple and God would not create a love that is wrong. Got that? Good,
because I'm not repeating it. Let me know if I'm going too fast for you at
anytime Mary Cherry and I'll slow down or draw pictures for you." Mary Cherry
nodded mutely, suddenly very very afraid. Sam took a few more steps towards her
until she had Mary Cherry backed up against the sink. Brooke watched with a half
smirk on her face. She loved it when Sam got wound up like this. For a couple of
reasons. First off, winding down was...fun. </p>
<p>"Second, we're only telling you and everyone else because you're our friends
although with you I use that term very loosely. Thirdly, neither of us gives a
shit what anyone thinks anymore, least of all a narrowminded little idiot like
you. If you have a problem with this, look away or go join Harrison and Carmen
at the reject homophobic table they currently reside at because we won't miss
your 'sparkling' company." </p>
<p>"Finally, and this is my favorite, who the Hell are you to accuse us of being
evil or wrong? Jesus, Mary Cherry, you're so inbred you were born with webbed
toes and feet for God's sake. Now if any love was wrong or evil, that was. Now
that, that is incest. And as far as us being gay and that being wrong, have you
talked to your father lately? If not I think you might want to have a LONG talk
with him cuz there's a little tidbit of info I think you might have overlooked
concerning him." Mary Cherry was blinking at her in shock and Brooke was trying,
rather unsuccessfully, to smother a giggle with the back of her hand. Sam put
her hands on her hips. </p>
<p>"Now," she started in a much calmer voice, "did you get all that?" Mary
Cherry nodded. "Good, now, either get your head out of your ass and congratulate
us on being happy or shut your oversized fly trap and get out of our sight." </p>
<p>It took Mary Cherry a few minutes to formulate an answer, she was staring at
Sam with her mouth wide open, speechless. While she waited, Sam went and sat
back down next to Brooke. Brooke wrapped her arms around Sam and hugged her
tightly. </p>
<p>"That was very sexy," Brooke purred into her ear, not caring that Mary Cherry
was still standing at the sink letting Sam's words sink in. Sam gave her a sexy
smile. </p>
<p>"Liked my little rant, did ya?" Sam asked as she kissed Brooke's forehead,
also ignoring Mary Cherry's existence. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"It was very...impassioned," Brooke whispered, leaning closer to Sam's face
and staring at Sam's lips. She watched the corners of Sam's mouth quirk up. </p>
<p>"I do impassioned very well, don't you think?" Sam teased while running her
tongue over her bottom lip. Brooke nodded, unable to think or form a response
for the blood roaring in her ears. She closed the gap between them and kissed
Sam for all she was worth and only broke apart when Mary Cherry decided to make
her presence known again. </p>
<p>"Geez, y'all get a room. Don't make me hose ya down." </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Section 6: Mary Cherry - Short Straw">
<p>"Just do me a favor and never join the debate team, Sam, that's all I'm
asking," Brooke said as she rested her head on Sam's abdomen and they both lay
sprawled on her bed later that night. She felt a rumble of laughter ripple
though Sam. </p>
<p>"Why's that, Princess?" Sam asked as she ran her hands through Brooke's hair
absently, reveling in the silky feel. </p>
<p>"I love to watch you argue. I think that's why I used to fight with you so
much. I love the way you light up when you get your groove on. It's such a turn
on," Brooke admitted with a smile. Another rumble of laughter went through Sam.
</p>
<p>"I get it. If I joined the Debate Team you'd want to jump my bones everytime
I got on stage and tried to argue a point. And while that wouldn't be a bad
thing for me, it might make scoring difficult for the judges to decide. So
noted." Brooke shifted slightly so that she could look into Sam's half lidded
eyes which stared back at her full of mirth and love. </p>
<p>"Yeah, well, Mary Cherry's lucky she interrupted when she did or she REALLY
would have gotten more than she bargined for." Sam scrunched up her nose. </p>
<p>"Ew, not into audiences, Princess," she stuck out her tongue at the thought.
Brooke moved up to capture the errant tongue and give it something better to do.
</p>
<p>"Am I really your Princess?" Brooke asked after she broke away minutes later
and stared intently into Sam's warm brown eyes. Sam cocked her head to the side
and smiled. </p>
<p>"Have you always had a knack for changing horses midstream or is it an
acquired talent?" Brooke swatted her on the arm and leaned into her embrace to
snuggle. </p>
<p>"Answer me, please. I need to know. You call me that all the time. Am I
really your Princess?" Sam frowned. </p>
<p>"Of course you are. Why would you think that you weren't, Brooke? To say that
I worship you, aside from sounding incredibly cheesy, would be too bland, it
wouldn't be enough to express how much you mean to me. Even saying 'I love you'
doesn't seem enough to make you understand the depth of what I feel for you."
</p>
<p>"Sammy," Brooke broke in, starting to cry. Sam wiped away her tears while
shaking her head. </p>
<p>"Let me finish, you asked. You are my Princess. You are my everything. Even
if I lost everything, everyone, if I still had you, I could survive it because
you'd be there. Even if I hadn't regained my voice or the use of my legs after
the accident, I think that if I had you by my side I would have been all right,
Brooke. You once called me your saviour, your hero. Well, you're mine, Brooke.
And I love you, with more words than even me, the writer, can say." Brooke was
crying openly now and Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"I hate it when you cry. I hate making you cry," Sam said sadly. Brooke shook
her head. </p>
<p>"Happy tears," she explained. "You say the most beautiful things, Sammy. I
love you and I love being your Princess." She reached over and kissed Sam again,
showing her exactly how much. Sam broke away a few minutes later, much to
Brooke's disappointment. </p>
<p>"Mom and Mike are home. We can't," Sam lamented. "We're a little TOO vocal,"
she blushed, which Brooke found endearing. She reached up and brushed some of
Sam's brown hair out of her face. </p>
<p>"I know," Brooke said, longing and desire evident in her voice. "So, we've
told everyone else, now all we have to do is tell Dad." Sam cringed. </p>
<p>"Ick. Not a happy thought, Brooke. So, who should do it?" Brooke shrugged.
</p>
<p>"Flip you for it," she suggested hopefully. Sam glared at her slightly. </p>
<p>"Oh, that's fair, he's your dad," Sam pointed out. Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"Fine, I'll tell him. Soon, I promise. Just make sure you and Mom are there."
Sam leaned her forehead against Brooke's. </p>
<p>"Of course, I would never abandon you," Sam said softly. A wicked smile
suddenly crossed Sam's face and she got up and walked over to Brooke's CD
player. Without saying a word, she went through the cds stacked there until she
found what she wanted and put it into the stereo. Turning the volume up and
pressing play, she sauntered over to the bed, a sexy and mischievous smile on
her face. </p>
<p>"That should do it," she said over the music as she reached for Brooke's
shirt. Brooke smiled back, understanding, and reached for Sam. </p>
<p>Downstairs, Mike wondered why he could hear Shaggy's Hotshot playing so
loudly since Brooke never listened to her stereo so loud but figured she must be
studying with Sam. Meanwhile Jane just shook her head and sighed. </p>
