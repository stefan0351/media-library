<chapter title="Section 7: Dad - Putting The `Fun' In Dysfunctional">
<p>Mike was sitting in the kitchen when Brooke walked in with a worried
expression on her face. He had been waiting for her, and Sam and Jane actually.
They had all asked to talk to him about something, something apparently very
big. Brooke spared him a wary smile and stood there chewing on her thumb, a
habit she hadn't resorted to in years. Now Mike knew something big was up. </p>
<p>"What's the matter, honey? You look really spooked." </p>
<p>Brooke shrugged and walked to the fridge and got out a bottle of water, which
she preceded to turn over in her hands. Another nervous habit. "I'd rather wait for Jane and Sam, Dad," she whispered. She sounded
frightened.</p>
<p>Mike was confused. He always felt that he and Brooke had a wonderful
open relationship where they could talk to each other. But lately it seemed like
she was pulling away from him and he had no idea why. (Is it drugs? Could she be
pregnant? Is she eating?) He mulled over the possibilities in his mind until Sam
and Jane walked in the room looking equally cautious. Now he was getting nevous. </p>
<p>"Mike," Jane started after the girls just looked at her and said nothing.
"The girls and I need to talk to you about something." </p>
<p>Mike put down his bagel and gave them his attention. "OK, shoot. What's going on with my favorite
ladies today? You're all wound up like spring toys ready to pop so, spill it." </p>
<p>Brooke took a deep breath. "Dad, you'd love me, no matter what, right?" </p>
<p>Mike frowned. "Of course I would? What kind of question is that? You're my first little
girl, nothing can change how I feel about you, Brooke," he told her confused by
the question. </p>
<p>"And you care about Sam, right? You could never hate her no matter what she
did right?" </p>
<p>"What's going on here?" Mike directed the question at Jane, his anxiety level
raising a few notches. </p>
<p>"Just answer her, Mike. It's important," Jane told him quietly. </p>
<p>"Yes, I care about Sam like she was another daughter. I tried to adopt her
but she wouldn't let me, remember? And I respected that decision. Will someone
please tell me what is going on here?" </p>
<p>"Dad, I don't know how to tell you this but, Sam and I, that is to say,
uhm.we're gay," Brooke stuttered out finally. </p>
<p>Mike blinked at her for a few minutes in shock. "Gay? As in really really happy or as in homosexual, Brooke?" </p>
<p>"Both, actually," Brooke said with a nervous laugh. "But mostly the latter."
</p>
<p>"I don't understand, Brooke. You dated Josh and there was Harrison and..." </p>
<p>"And they were mistakes, Dad. I didn't want to face that but they were. I'm
gay." There, she said it and the world didn't end.
<whew /></p>
<p>"But you're a cheerleader," Mike argued. (Argh) </p>
<p>"Being straight is not a prerequisite for making the squad, although Mary
Cherry might change that soon." Brooke huffed annoyed. (Especially if she ever
finds out about Nicole) </p>
<p>Mary Cherry had taken the news rather well, after she got over her whole
Christian, incest was a sin and that Brooke and Sam had a first class set of
front row tickets on the express train to Hell rant. Sam had not so subtly
reminded her that not only was she so inbred that she had webbed toes and hands
but that her father was a gay drag queen. That took the wind right out of the
girls' blustery sails and she then suggested that they `bond' over the thing,
which sent Brooke and Sam running for the nearest exit post haste. But this
whole But-You're-A-Cheerleader-Syndrome was really starting to bug Brooke. </p>
<p>"Are you sure this isn't a phase or something, Brooke? All teenagers question
their sexuality from time to time." </p>
<p>"Trust me Dad, I went over that for a while. This is no phase, it's the real
deal."</p>
<p>Mike was silent for a few minutes and Brooke glanced at Sam nervously. Sam
shrugged back. </p>
<p>"Honey," Mike said finally, "you're just lonely." </p>
<p>Brooke rolled her eyes. She'd been waiting for this, expecting it. </p>
<p>"You've had some bad experiences with guys and now you're confused. Trust me,
the right guy will come along eventually and things will clear right up." Mike
smiled, apparently happy with his deduction. Sam sent her mother a desperate
glance. </p>
<p>"Mike," Jane started. </p>
<p>"Dad," Brooke broke in at the same time, standing closer to Sam now, needing
her support. "I don't think you're following the conversation." The smile faded
from Mike's face and his expression turned cold. </p>
<p>"There is nothing wrong with you, Brooke," he said simply. </p>
<p>Brooke felt her anger level rise at that statement. "I never said there was, Dad," she shot back angrily. "I said I was gay, not
wrong. The two are not mutually exclusive, you know." </p>
<p>"Brooke, calm down," Sam finally spoke up. </p>
<p>Mike turned to her with a deadly glare. "You stay out of this," he growled at her. "This is family business." </p>
<p>Right
about then all Hell broke loose in the McQueen kitchen. Jane and Brooke saw the
look of utter hurt and rejection that Sam was unable to mask from her features.
And then they watched every wall and defense she ever had go right back up
stronger then ever and her normally kind and friendly brown eyes turn dull and
cold. They both knew that Mike had just hit a particularly sore spot with Sam. </p>
<p>"You're right, Mike. I was never a part of this family and I never had any
right thinking that I was," she answered in the same cold voice Mike had used.
"But this IS my business." Instead of leaving the room, Sam continued to stare
down Mike who was unmoved. Brooke and Jane moved to stand between the two. There
was a dangerous level of tension between the two. </p>
<p>"Stop it both of you!" Jane ordered. "You're both out of line. Mike, you're
upset over Brooke's news and taking it out on Sam and Sam, you're hurt and
saying things you don't mean. Now everyone just calm down." </p>
<p>Brooke layed a
supportive hand on Sam's shoulder and was surprised to find the other girl
shaking. "Calm down, Sammy," she whispered for only Sam to hear. "He didn't mean
it." Sam looked into the loving eyes of her girlfriend and felt some of her
anger dissipate. </p>
<p>Mike was still shooting daggers at her however. He if caught any of that
little exchange, he wasn't letting on. "When did you discover this, Brooke? When did you `decide' you were gay?" he
asked contemptously. </p>
<p>Brooke sighed. (This is not going well) "I didn't `decide' anything. It just sort of developed. I started developing
feelings for someone, a woman, and they kept getting stronger and we kept
getting closer. And I realized that the reason my relationships with men never
went anywhere was because they did nothing for me, but she does." </p>
<p>"That's disgusting," Mike spat. </p>
<p>"Oh, please," Sam rolled her eyes, unable to stop herself from commenting. </p>
<p>Mike ignored her. "So who, Brooke? Who have you decided to throw your entire
future, your entire life away for, huh? Just because you have no idea what it is
you really want?" </p>
<p>Brooke couldn't believe the words coming out of her father's mouth. It was
like talking to a stranger. She looked at Sam for reassurance and Sam nodded.
Taking strength from Sam and mustering the last of her own courage, Brooke
looked her father in the eye and told him the name of the woman who had stolen
her heart and soul. </p>
<p>"Sam," she said simply. "I love, am in love with Sam."</p>
<p>Mike jumped up from his seat with a murderous glint in his eye. The only
things between him and Sam were Jane and Brooke. And both women were afraid to
think what would happen if he got his hands on Sam. Suddenly Sam's fear of wood
chippers didn't seem so foolish. "So this is your fault?" he accused
dramatically. </p>
<p>Sam glared right back at him. "My fault? Are you some sort of nutcase, Mike?" she asked in all seriousness. </p>
<p>"You did this to my little girl, didn't you? With your `ways'?" </p>
<p>Sam couldn't even begin to fathom what the Hell he was talking about. (Did he
and Mary Cherry go to the same class or something, because at least from her it
was funny) </p>
<p>"Mike, being gay isn't like a light switch you wake up one morning and
decided to flip to the `on' position. You either are or you aren't. I didn't
`do' anything to Brooke other than love her. She loves me of her own free will.
I didn't ask her to." Sam spoke calmly, not wanting to make the situation worse
no matter how hurt or angry she was. It wouldn't help anything and could
possibly lead to Brooke getting the bad end of things. She watched as Mike
turned an alarming shade of red. </p>
<p>"Get out of my house," he ordered a stunned Sam. She blinked back the sudden
tears, unwilling to give him the satisfaction. </p>
<p>"If she goes, Dad, so do I," Brooke announced firmly. She grabbed Sam's hand
tightly in her own. Mike saw this and ground his teeth together. His color
started to shift to purple. </p>
<p>"So do Mac and I," Jane added. Mike turned his attention to Jane. </p>
<p>"You knew about this?" she nodded. "How long? Why didn't you tell me?" </p>
<p>"Not long and because I was afraid of this. Mike, you need to calm down.
These two really and truly love each other," </p>
<p>Mike shook his head. "This isn't love, this is sick! I want you both out of my sight," he told Sam
and Brooke. Sam moved with Brooke closer to Jane and Mike moved out towards her.
They met in the middle of the kitchen. "You've corrupted my baby girl," he
snarled. </p>
<p>"I did no such thing, Mike," Sam responded, oddly calm. "I love your
daughter. Either accept that or don't. I don't care. But get over your narrow
minded, Christian right wing militia, hatred and ignorance before you lose your
daughter forever." To the absolute shock of everyone in the room, Mike raised
his hand to hit Sam who flinched and waited for the blow to come. </p>
<p>"Daddy no!" Booke called out as Mike's hand was raised in the air above Sam's
head. He swung his arm down and stopped mere inches away from Sam's face as
Brooke moved to intercept. </p>
<p>"Get out of my house," he repeated in a low, hushed voice. "All of you." He
turned and stomped out of the kitchen leaving the three women in stunned
silence. </p>
<p>Jane spoke first. "Sam? Are you alright?" </p>
<p>Sam nodded. "I'm fine, Mom," she said, absolutely shocked by the way things
played out. She looked over at Brooke who was still staring at the direction her
father had gone in. She turned to her mother. "Can you give us a second?" </p>
<p>Jane nodded. "I'll go get Mac ready and meet you at the car. We'll stay at a
hotel until he calms down," Jane walked over and put a hand on Brooke's
shoulder. "He'll calm down, Brooke, you'll see. This is just a shock. Give him
some time." Brooke just nodded a without saying anything and Jane wasn't sure
she understood the words. </p>
<p>Sam spared her mother a glance. "Just go, Mom, I'll take care of her," Jane
nodded and left the room. </p>
<p>Sam wrapped her arms around the still silent Brooke. "You OK?" </p>
<p>Brooke shook her head. "He was going to hurt you," she said in a voice barely her own. "He's never
hit me, no matter what I did, but he was ready to hit you." She turned to Sam
and Sam could see the tears in Brooke's eyes. She reached up and caught them as
they fell. </p>
<p>"But he didn't Brooke, he stopped himself," Sam reminded her even though her
heart was just now returning to its normal rhythm after the incident. She
thought Mike was going to hit her too, and she was again thankful they didn't
own a woodchipper. </p>
<p>"That wasn't my father," Brooke whispered in disbelief. </p>
<p>Sam sighed. "That was a man faced with a harsh reality he didn't want to
face, Brooke. Unfortunately it happens everyday. But Mike's a nice guy, when
he's not being totally insane like just now, he'll come around, you'll see," Sam
tried to reassure her even though she wasn't so sure herself. </p>
<p>Brooke sniffed and leaned into Sam. "We'd better go pack, huh?" </p>
<p>Sam nodded reluctantly. "Another glorious stay at your local Motel 6 for the
McPherson's. At least we have you and Mac to keep us company this time. Trust
me, after Mike's stuck in the Palace for a few days by himself with no daughter,
fiancée, baby, or stepdaughter to drive him crazy, he'll be begging us to come
home, homosexuality issues aside." </p>
<p>Brooke looked up at her dubiously. "God I hope you're right," she sighed holding Sam tighter, needing her
strength. </p>
<p>(So do I Princess, so do I) </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Section 7: Dad - What Would You Do For A Klondike Bar?">
<p>Sam was partially right. A week later, Mike did ask Jane and Brooke to come
home but he had no interest in Sam whatsoever. To him, the young brunette simply
ceased to exist. He subscribed to the `If you ignore it it doesn't exist' school
of thought. Sam shrugged it off but both Jane and Brooke knew that Sam was
deeply hurt by it. They told Mike that they would not return to the Palace
without her and he reluctantly acquiesced but firmly stated that he did not at
anytime want to see or hear from Sam. Which was fine with her since the feeling
was entirely mutual. </p>
<p>Mike was also watching poor Brooke like a hawk. She was never at anytime
allowed to be in Sam's company alone. The locks were gone from their bedroom
doors as well as the bathroom door. Because of Mike's aversion to Sam, Jane had
to chaperone the two girls when they were home together. The three of them joked
that he probably wouldn't be happy to know that she let them kiss and cuddle
when they were together but it wasn't like they were going to tell him. Mike
didn't let them talk about the situation either. Whenever Jane or Brooke tried
to appoach him about the subject, he let them know on no uncertain terms whose
house they were in and where the door was. And dinners were and awkward
situation, filled with tense silences and stilted conversations. It reminded
Brooke and Sam of how things were when their families first moved in together.
It would have been funny, if it wasn't so damn sad. </p>
<p>So Sam was a non-entity. But you can only be invisible for so long until the
cosmic forces of the universe get bored and decide to make you visible to the
one person who hates you the most. And as such, Sam and Mike accidentally found
themselves home alone together one afternoon when Jane was at work and Brooke
was still at school. </p>
<p>"I hate my life," Sam grumbled as she walked in the door, home early because
the cold she was fighting finally won. Loaded down with books, she collapsed on
the couch and sneezed violently. She laid her head on the back of the couch and
promptly fell asleep. Mike walked into the livingroom a half-hour later and
stopped short. </p>
<p>"What are you doing home from school early? Or don't you go to school
anymore?" he asked angrily. Sam woke up groggily, the cold making her foggy and
stared at him for a second. </p>
<p>"'M sick, Mike. Nurse sent me home, k?" she responded as she tried to stand
up but her legs were wobbly and she ungracefully flopped back down to the couch.
Mike was untouched. </p>
<p>"Sure, whatever. I've been meaning to talk to you, Samantha," Sam arched an
eyebrow. Mike never called her 'Samantha' and he had barely given her the time
of day in two weeks and now he wanted to talk to her. (This can't be good) </p>
<p>"Sure," Sam answered weakly, really not feeling well. (Trust him to pick a
time when I feel like crap to get into a rumble with me) </p>
<p>"What do you get out of this?" he asked, his anger and outrage showing in his
voice. Sam's confusion and shock showed on her face. </p>
<p>"What are you talking about?" Sam asked, trying desperately to keep up with
the conversation. </p>
<p>"Playing with my daughter's affections like this. What do you get out of it?"
Sam stared at him in absolute mute shock. Mike continued. "Is this some sort of
twisted plan on your part to finally destroy things between your mother and I?
Because I have to tell you, it's working pretty damn well, you've got her
believing that whatever you feel for Brooke is genuine. Let's face facts, Sam,
the only person you care about is yourself. So, tell me, what do you get out of
this?" Sam was still unable to form a pertinent response, whether it was from
the fever she was running or disbelief at the words she was hearing she didn't
know. Thinking he had hit the nail on the head, Mike laughed and kept going on
his little diatribe. </p>
<p>"See, you can't even answer me. You're preying on Brooke because she's
vulnerable right now. Harrison and Josh left her emotionally vulnerable and
you're taking advantage because you're sexually ambiguous not to mention highly
ambitious and willing to screw over anyone you have to to get what you want." By
now anger had propelled Sam to her feet and she slapped Mike hard across the
face. Her face was contorted in barely controlled rage. </p>
<p>"You ignorant, narrow-minded, homophobic, bigoted asshole! I swear all you're
missing is a white sheet! You have no idea what you're talking about! How
someone like you could have raised someone as loving and gentle as Brooke
boggles the mind. I am not using Brooke, I love her. If that's too much for you
to handle, well, then tough. I'm sick and tired of walking on eggshells because
you've got some sort of issues with your sexuality." </p>
<p>"Don't use that tone with me, young lady," Mike warned. </p>
<p>Sam flashed a feral smile. "Don't talk to me like you're my father, M-I-K-E," she enunciated the name
annoyingly slow. The room was beginning to spin and she knew she had to get up
to bed before the cold and fever knocked her off her feet and Mike threw her out
the door while she was unconscious. </p>
<p>"I'm not going to let you rip this family apart," Mike warned while wagging
his finger at her. If he wasn't so fuzzy, Sam figured he'd look funny. </p>
<p>"I'm not the one doing it, Mike," Sam said tiredly. "You are." She grabbed
her stuff and headed towards the stairs. </p>
<p>"Where do you think you're going? We're not finished here, young lady! Don't
walk away from me when I'm talking to you," Sam stopped and turned around for a
minute at the bottom of the stairs. </p>
<p>"Mike, I'm genuinely sick and need to rest. Whether you believe me or not, I
could care less. And we are finished because we're not talking, you're ranting,
raving, spewing homophobic hatred and ignorance and not listening to a word I
say. When you're ready to listen to reason, or at least calm down and remember
that you're the adult here, come talk to me again. Until then, leave me alone,
please." </p>
<p>Finished dealing with Mike for the time being and feeling worse with every
passing second, Sam climbed over the stairs and barely made it to her bed before
she collapsed, physically and emotionally exhausted. She quickly fell into a
feverish sleep and longed for Brooke to hurry home. </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Section 7: Dad - Feverdreams, Nightmares, And Arguments">
<p>"Sam, come on, you have to eat something," Brooke coaxed the sick girl. Sam
groaned and turned away. Eating was definitely something she never wanted to do
again. It wasn't a cold, it was the unholy flu. </p>
<p>"Go 'way, Brooke, 'for you get sick, too," Sam protested. Brooke smiled at
the concern but was unswayed. She was worried when Sam wasn't at lunch earlier
and even more worried when Lily said she's gone home sick. Sam wasn't known for
going home sick or missing much school at all, in fact. If you're not there, you
might miss a juicy tidbit of journalistic information. So Brooke had gone home
after lunch to check on her, found her father absolutely livid and then worried
he'd actually done Sam in when she discovered that the two of them had had an
altercation. He'd bellowed something about 'getting Sam the Hell out of his
house if he had to get a court order to do it' and stomped off again and Brooke
went to find Sam. </p>
<p>Sam was dead asleep on top of her covers fully clothed and bathed in sweat.
She'd caught the awful flu that was presently decimating most of Kennedy High.
Thankfully, Brooke had been smart enough to get a flu shot, but not Sam, not
I-never-get-the-flu Sam. (This'll teach her) Brooke thought sadly as she put a
cold compress on Sam's flushed forehead and tried again to get her to eat some
chicken soup. </p>
<p>"Eat some soup, Sammy," Brooke whispered. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Why? So I can throw it back up again? No thanks," she retorted with a sigh.
She hated being sick, but she loved having Brooke take care of her. (Guilty
pleasure, bad Sammy) Sam scolded herself weakly. She loved being in Brooke's
arms and being sick gave her a reason that wouldn't make Mike freak too bad. </p>
<p>"Come on, Sammy, for me?" Brooke begged. Sam's eyes opened fractionally and
she frowned. </p>
<p>"Cheater," she accused. Brooke smiled. She knew that would work even if it
was a dirty trick. Sam managed to choke down a few mouthfuls of lukewarm soup
before shaking her head for Brooke to stop. </p>
<p>"OK, enough for now, I get the point," Brooke assured her. Sam settled back
into Brooke's embrace while Brooke stroked her damp hair away from her face. "I
heard you and Dad had a meeting of the minds earlier." She watched Sam's nose
wrinkle in distaste. </p>
<p>"It was one sided. I was armed, he wasn't," Sam whispered tiredly. She
snuggled deeper into Brooke's arms needing to feel better anyway she could.
Brooke always made her feel better, emotionally and physically. Brooke giggled
slightly at Sam's comment. </p>
<p>"There was a time I would have been insulted by that comment but I'm sure he
wasn't. He didn't hurt you, did he?" she asked, honestly afraid that without her
or Jane was referee, Mike had hit Sam. She felt Sam shake her head. </p>
<p>"No," Sam yawned. "I hit him. Sorry." Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"He probably deserved it. What did he say?" </p>
<p>"'M tired, Brooke. Don' wanna talk about it right now. Can I get some sleep
instead?" Sam asked, sounding just as tired as she said she was. Brooke mentally
kicked herself for interrogating the ill girl and hugged the quaking form in her
arms. </p>
<p>"Of course, Sammy. Sleep, I'll keep you safe," she whispered. She felt rather
than saw Sam smile. </p>
<p>"You always do, Princess." </p>
<center>
<p>**</p>
</center>
<p>They were both woken later by a pair of angry voices carrying down the hall.
Brooke looked down at Sam who looked back with red rimmed, sick but awake eyes.
</p>
<p>"Mom and Mike," she pointed out sadly. Brooke nodded. They sat silently and
listened. </p>
<p>"She can't stay here, Jane. This is my house and she isn't welcome here!" </p>
<p>"How can you say that? She's my daughter! If she isn't welcome here than
neither am I! Neither is Mac!" </p>
<p>"You're my fiancee, I love you and Mac is my daughter, same as Brooke is. Sam
means nothing to me!" Brooke held Sam closer to her as an ever so small sob
slipped past Sam's lips and she buried her face in Brooke's chest. </p>
<p>"Jane, don't you see what she's doing? She doesn't care for Brooke like she
says she does. She's just using her to break us up. She's been trying to break
us up since day one. She can't stand the thought of you being with anyone other
than Joe. This is the only way she has left to stop you from moving on with your
own life." </p>
<p>"That's a lie and you know it! Sam wants nothing more than for me to be happy
and she knows that being with you makes me happy. Or at least it used to until
you started acting this way!" </p>
<p>"Is the fact that Sam is gay and involved with Brooke making you happy?"
There was a pause before Jane answered. </p>
<p>"At first, no. But then I talked to her, and Brooke, Mike. And I saw the love
between them. They're happy together, Mike and that makes me happy. Damnit,
that's enough." </p>
<p>"How the Hell do we explain this to MacKenzie when she's old enough to
understand?" </p>
<p>"Good question," Sam whispered. Brooke 'shushed' her. </p>
<p>"We cross that bridge when we get to it. Besides, she'll grow up with it as
an everyday thing, it won't strike her as abnormal. Mike, you have to stop
blaming Sam for this, it isn't anyone's fault." </p>
<p>"That's where you're wrong. It IS Sam's fault. I'm losing you, I'm losing
Brooke and it's all Sam's fault. This isn't normal, Jane and I won't accept it
as such. Somehow Sam has played on Brooke's confusion and vulnerability and
after she gets what she wants, she'll leave Brooke, broken and destroyed on the
side of the road and move on to someone new. I won't stand by and watch her
destroy my daughter." </p>
<p>"God, I never knew you thought so little of Sam." </p>
<p>"I always liked Sam but I questioned her ethics. You remember how far she was
willing to go to get a story, what she'd do to hurt Brooke? How can you stand
there and tell me that this is the same girl professing her undying love for
Brooke when a year ago she was tearing her apart in the school paper every
chance she got?" </p>
<p>"That was different, Mike. There's a thin line between love and hate." </p>
<p>"That's a weak excuse, Jane." </p>
<p>"It's the truth." </p>
<p>"Your truth. My truth is that this is not a topic open for discussion. Either
they knock it off or Sam leaves, am I making myself clear?" </p>
<p>"..." </p>
<p>"I'm serious, Jane." </p>
<p>"How is telling them to 'knock it off' any better than the pranks they used
to play to break us up?" </p>
<p>"We're finished with this conversation." </p>
<p>Sam and Brooke heard Mike walk down the hall and a door slam somewhere else
in the house. A few seconds later, there was a soft knock on their door. </p>
<p>"Come in," Brooke called softly. Jane walked in, tears still evident on her
face. She gave the two a weak smile. </p>
<p>"How you feeling sweety?" she asked Sam as she sat on the bed and felt Sam's
forehead. She was worried at how hot Sam felt. Sam spared her a weak smile. </p>
<p>"Like I'm heading to the gallows in the morning," Sam responded. Jane sighed.
</p>
<p>"I take it you two overheard?" Both girls nodded. "We'll find a way through
this, I promise." </p>
<p>"We know," Brooke answered. Sam yawned and closed her eyes, snuggling close
to Brooke and letting the flu take her away from the cold reality she didn't
feel like dealing with at the moment. Brooke and Jane exchanged concerned and
wary glances over her sick form. </p>
<p>"I promise," Jane repeated. </p>
<center>
<p>**</p>
</center>
<p>Another pair of angry voices, these two closer and even more rage filled
awakened Sam the next morning. </p>
<p>"You will get dressed for school, young lady, and THAT is final!" Sam scooted
up further in the bed to listen better. </p>
<p>"Someone has to stay home with her Dad," Brooke's voice carried to Sam's ears
sounding at once furious and at the same time concerned. Sam sighed. Now it was
Brooke and Mike's turn to rip into each other over her. </p>
<p>"She's a big girl, Brooke, she can take care of herself!" Mike bellowed. </p>
<p>"She's got a temperature of 103!" Brooke screamed. "She spent most of last
night delerious and vomiting," Sam winced at the fuzzy memory of Brooke holding
back her hair and rubbing her back. Truth to tell, she still felt like crap. "At
one point she thought she was Mighty Mouse!" (Oh, great, now I'm never going to
live that one down) </p>
<p>"Jane can stay with her, you have to go to school." </p>
<p>"Mom would but she has an important business meeting and you know it!" Brooke
responded. "I have to stay with Sam, unless you want to," she asked
sarcastically. </p>
<p>"Don't use that tone with me young lady," Mike warned. Sam yawned and rolled
her eyes. (Mike really needs new material) </p>
<p>"Well? Are you? Because if not, I am. Sam is in no shape to take care of
herself. And THAT is final, Dad," Brooke said in a tone that Sam knew meant that
no matter what Mike said or did she wouldn't be changing her mind. </p>
<p>"Who are you because you sure aren't my daughter?" Mike asked angrily. Sam
blinked back the tears that sprang to her eyes and she knew that Brooke was
probably doing the same thing outside the door. </p>
<p>"I AM still your daughter, you just have no interest in who that really is
anymore because I don't fit the mold you want me to. And I'm not going to
apologize for that either. Live with it or get out of my way," the door swung
open and a highly upset Brooke stormed into the room, slamming it behind her.
Sam jumped. Brooke saw that she was awake and the anger drained away from her
expression. </p>
<p>"How you feeling, sweetie?" she asked as she put her hand on Sam's forehead.
Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"Like shit," Sam whispered, her voice gone and weariness beginning to
overtake her. Brooke frowned. </p>
<p>"You're still awfully warm. Come on, back to sleep with you," she said as she
tucked Sam back in and crawled in beside her. Sam instictively curled up beside
Brooke and Brooke wrapped her arms around the sick girl. "Sleep, Sammy, you'll
feel better later." </p>
<p>"Promise?" Sam asked just above a whisper, eyes shut and all ready half
asleep. Brooke smiled and placed a kiss in Sam's sweat dampened hair. </p>
<p>"I promise." </p>

<chapter title="Section 7: Dad - Leaving On A Jet Plane">
<p>Eight days later Sam finally felt almost human again. Unfortunately that was
about the best thing she could say about herself. She was packed and ready to
go. Jane appeared in her door, disapproving look on her face. </p>
<p>"Are you absolutely sure about this?" Sam sighed. If her mother asked her
that one more time... </p>
<p>"For the four millionth time, no, I'm not, but it has to be done," she turned
to face her mother. "He said it, not me. I can't stay here, Mom. You and Brooke
stand to lose everything if I do. I won't let that happen." </p>
<p>"At least wait until Brooke gets home from practice," Jane begged. Sam shook
her head. </p>
<p>"If I do that I'll never leave. No, Mom, I gotta go now while she's not here.
I know it's cowardly but I have to." She walked over and hugged her mother.
"Please stick to our agreement. Don't tell her where I went and don't call
unless it's an emergency. I'll call every few days to check on you and Brooke
and you can fill me in, OK?" Jane nodded. </p>
<p>"I don't like it, but all right. You're going to be hurting her, you know,"
Sam nodded sadly and a few tears slipped down her cheeks. </p>
<p>"I know. But losing Mike will hurt more. I know what it's like to lose your
Dad and I won't let Brooke go through that if I can stop it. Have you noticed
them lately? They're tearing each other apart. They make any fight Brooke and I
ever had look like spitball fights in comparison. It's awful and they're going
to damage their relationship beyond repair if it keeps up. I won't let that
happen," she looked up at her mother, her brown eyes pleading. "Please help her
understand." </p>
<p>"I'll do my best, honey. Honest." </p>
<p>"Thanks, Mom. And try to fix things with Mike, yourself. He's a nice guy, in
there somewhere. I won't be ground zero for this nuclear family." She headed
down the stairs to the car. Jane stopped her at the door. </p>
<p>"If it means anything to you, honey, you're father would be proud of the way
you stood up for yourself and I think he'd be fine with you and Brooke as long
as you were happy." A genuine smile lit up Sam's face for the first time since
telling Mike about her and Brooke's relationship. </p>
<p>"You know it does mean something, Mom. And somehow, I know he would be OK,"
finally she was starting to understand the message Joe had given her while she
was in a coma. `Pain is temporary, love is forever.' It didn't make this
decision any easier though. </p>
<p>"You'll call when you get there?" Jane asked as she hugged Sam again. She
hated the idea of saying good-bye to Sam. Somehow the whole situation struck her
as wrong, Sam shouldn't be leaving, running away. She should be staying and
fighting for Brooke. But things were getting worse and not better with Mike and
she could see Sam's point. Sometimes the best thing to do is to step away and
give people some room. </p>
<p>"Of course," Sam answered. She fixed her mother with an intense stare. "You
will take care of her right? Don't let her do anything stupid. I'm doing this so
that you both can fix things with Mike, OK? But I'm worried that she's going to
think I'm abandoning her like her mother did. Please make sure she knows that
isn't the case," Sam begged. Jane nodded. </p>
<p>"I'll try but you know you can avoid the whole thing if you just stay." Sam
sighed and frowned. </p>
<p>"Please just stop that, I feel bad enough all ready. My mind is made up. I'm
going. Mike isn't going to calm down as long as I'm here. He's bound and
determined to blame me for this whole thing, so remove me from the equation and
maybe you and Brooke can find some resolutions." </p>
<p>"All right," Jane conceeded. "Well, you'd better get going if you want to
miss the worse traffic and be gone before Brooke gets home." Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"I love you, Mom. And I'l come home soon, I promise. Take care of yourself
and Mac and especially Brooke for me," she said with a sad smile. Jane smiled
through her tears as Sam climbed in her car. </p>
<p>"I will, honey, and take care of yourself." Sam waved and pulled out of the
driveway. (Well,) Jane thought (This will either make them, or break them) </p>
<center>
<p>**</p>
</center>
<p>Brooke bounded up the stairs after practice excited to see Sam who was
finally feeling better after a bad bout with the flu. She entered Sam's room to
find it empty. Not just lacking in an occupant, but devoid of many of Sam's
belongings; her Cds, laptop, school stuff, her dressers were cleaned off and,
upon inspection, her closets were nearly empty. Dread and fear filled Brooke at
the thought that her father had finally thrown Sam out of the house when a small
envelope taped to Sam's vanity with her name written on it caught her eye. </p>
<p>She opened the envelope carefully and started reading. And heard her entire
world crash down around her feet. </p>
<i>
<p><br/>
Dear Brooke, </p>
<p>
First and foremost, I love you more than anything or anyone on this Earth.
Please know this. There isn't a part of me that doesn't love you. I never
thought it possible to love someone, need someone as much as I do you. It scares
me sometimes, but I would never trade it for anything. And I would never hurt
you. I'd die before I'd let that happen or let anyone else do it either. I think
I proved that with Nicole. But even having said all that, this is something I
have to do. I can't sit by and watch you and your father destroy yourselves.
</p>
<p>I loved my dad a lot, still do and not a day goes by that I
don't wish he was still here to talk to, laugh with, sit with or just be with. I
envy the relationship you and Mike have and I refuse to be what destroys it. I'm
not willing to give up on us either but there has to be some sort of middle
ground.</p>
<p>It's obvious that with me around, Mike's not going to be
willing to talk to you or Mom about this insane situation we've found ourselves
in. Don't you find it highly ironic that we wasted all that time trying to find
ways to break them apart when all we had to do was face how we really felt for
each other and it would have done it for us? Not funny, I know, but still.</p>
<p>I care about Mike, and I know my Mom really loves him so I
will not be the reason she loses him. And I need to think about little Mac too.
You and I both grew up in single parent households and I won't make her suffer
through that if I can prevent it.</p>
<p>So here's my warped Sam McPherson logic: if I give Mike
some time and space, maybe you and he can talk this out without me as an added
distraction. He needs to get this straight (no pun intended). Whether you love
me or not, Brooke, you've accepted the fact that you're gay, that won't change.
Make him start with accepting that. Accepting me is secondary. Your relationship
with your Dad is important and I won't let you lose it because of me.</p>
<p>Listen to him, give him a chance to air his concerns and
fears, however bigoted and homophobic they may be. He is entitled to them. Deep
down, he still loves you and nothing will change that, not even me. He just
needs time, Brooke. We just need to be willing to give it to him.</p>
<p>I am in no way abandoning you. Just the opposite. I will be with you every
step of the way, I just think it'd be easier for all concerned if I step away
for a while and let you and your dad get reaquainted. Don't ask Mom where I
went, she won't tell you. I asked her not to so that you and Mike can have the
time you need, but I will be calling to check on you often.</p>
<p>Please don't be mad at me for doing this. This decision
wasn't easy but it's the only solution I could find that didn't involve a
straight jacket for Mike, ending Mom and Mike's engagement or destroying your
relationship with your Dad completely. Maybe I'm being selfish, cowardly even,
running away like this. I don't know anymore. All I do know is that I love you
with all my heart and soul. And I will come home to you.</p>
<p>Until then, take care, Princess. Remember that I love you.</p>
<p>Your Love Forever, </p>
<p>Sam McPherson </p></i>
<p><br/>
Brooke could see where the ink was smudged from where Sam's tears had fallen as
she had written the letter. And now her own tears added to the smudges. She was
angry, hurt, scared, and deeply touched all at the same time. </p>
<p>"Are you all right?" Jane asked from the doorway where she'd been silently
observing the girl. Brooke turned around, eyes streaming rivers of tears and
Jane walked over to wrap the girl in a hug. </p>
<p>"Shhhh, it'll be all right, you'll see," she soothed the sobbing girl. </p>
<p>"She's gone," Brooke mourned. "My Sammy left me." Jane rubbed the girls'
back. </p>
<p>"It'll work out, Brooke, you'll see," only thing was, Jane had no idea how.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Section 7: Dad - You Are The Weakest Link-Good Bye">
<p>"Why'd she do it, Jane?" Brooke asked mournfully as she leaned her head
against Jane's shoulder as they sat on Sam's bed a few nights later. Things were
indeed calmer in the Palace without Sam around, Mike was acting more like
himself, but Brooke wasn't and Jane was becoming worried. But Mike didn't seem
to notice. True to her word, Jane was keeping a very close eye on her daughter's
true love. She held the distraught girl closer and tried to put words to Sam's
reasoning, reasoning even she didn't fully understand. </p>
<p>"She wanted to spare you, Brooke. She hates seeing you in pain," Jane began.
Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"But being away from her causes me pain, doesn't she see that? God, I feel
like I'm dying," she bewailed as fresh tears began to flow. Brooke thought after
this long she'd be out of tears but they never seemed to stop. Jane sighed and
silently cursed her daughter's decision to leave. </p>
<p>"She was doing what she thought was the right thing. Whether we agree or not
isn't the point, her heart was in the right place. I know it's hard to
understand, Hell, I'm her mother and I don't understand how her mind works but
it was tearing her apart to watch what this was doing to you and Mike. You know
Sam, if there something she could do to stop it, she'd do it and to Hell with
personal cost." </p>
<p>"But it's not fair! Why can't I have both? Why can't Dad just accept things
as they are and move on?" Brooke demanded angrily. </p>
<p>"Because you're his little girl, Brooke. It's very difficult to be faced with
something like this," Jane explained patiently. </p>
<p>"But you've worked through it, haven't you? Sam and me, I mean? You don't
think any less of us now, do you?" Brooke asked fearfully. Jane smiled gently
and shook her head. </p>
<p>"Not at all. But I have a few advantages Mike doesn't. First off, I'm a
woman, we tend to look at things differently anyway. Somehow, you've managed to
offend his manhood, although I have no idea how. Secondly, I saw what was going
on between you two so I had an idea even if I did try to ignore it at first.
Sure, I was a little disturbed, but once I got past the glaringly obvious, I saw
the genuine, deep love between the two of you. Mike hasn't been able to see that
because he's unwilling to see that." </p>
<p>"Why? I don't see what Sam and I have as wrong. I just don't. How can love be
wrong?" </p>
<p>"It's not, honey. I think Mike feels that he's failed somewhere with raising
you. He has a blonde, blue-eyed, cheerleading, homecoming queen daughter, the
perfect recipe for All-American and you turn around and tell him you're gay. And
in love with your soon-to-be-stepsister. His entire world was suddenly turned on
its axis and he didn't know how to handle it. So he reacted the only way
available to him, badly." </p>
<p>"Oh," Brooke said as Jane's words sunk in. "But that doesn't explain why he
blamed Sammy. I'm gay with or without her." Jane sighed. </p>
<p>"No, it doesn't explain it," barely restrained resentment colored her voice.
"But it was easier to blame the lesser known of the two of you than his own baby
girl." </p>
<p>"That's not fair. We're in this together," she paused and hung her head. "I
really thought he was going to hurt her," she finished softly. </p>
<p>"So did I," the image of Mike raising his hand to strike Sam still vividly
fresh in Jane's mind. Normally Jane knew such behavior was beyond Mike, he would
never harm her, Sam, Brooke, or Mac. But the news of Brooke's and Sam's
relationship just pushed him to a place beyond his control. That and the fact
that he had stopped short of actually hitting her were the only reasons Jane
hadn't left him on the spot. There was no way in Hell she'd stay with an abusive
man, not for herself, Sam, Mac or Brooke. </p>
<p>But Mike wasn't by nature abusive. Everyone has a breaking point and they'd
simply hit his like a watermelon hitting a brick wall at 200mph. Jane had been
expecting a bad reaction, she just hadn't been expecting one THAT bad. Mike was
a mild-mannered, go-with-the-flow kind of guy, it was one of the things that had
attracted Jane to him in the first place. And yet here he was doing his best
right wing, Christian coalitian, homophobic, not-in-my-family imitation and he
was pretty damn convincing. And it baffled Jane how he could have reacted so
badly. </p>
<p>He had turned on Sam like a pitbull on a ketcup covered cat and it had scared
her. In Mike's eyes, the whole situation was some sort of plot on Sam's part to
tear the family apart. That somehow, Sam had twisted Brooke's sweet sisterly
affections into something perverted and was just using the girl to justify her
own sick cause. But Jane knew differently. If only Mike would listen to reason.
</p>
<p>"I've never seen my Dad act that way, Mom," Brooke sighed as she wrapped
Sam's blanket around herself tighter, drinking in the smell of Sam. Jane shook
her head. </p>
<p>"That was an extreme, Brooke. We all know he never would have hurt her." </p>
<p>"I know, it doesn't make it any less scary, though," Brooke pointed out. Jane
shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, it doesn't," she agreed. "Are you coming down to dinner?" Brooke
shrugged. </p>
<p>"No, not hungry." Jane gave her a disapproving look. </p>
<p>"Brooke, you have to eat," she started. Brooke huffed angrily at her. </p>
<p>"I am, don't start that with me. I just don't want to eat with HIM, all
right? Everytime I try to talk to him he acts like nothing's wrong and Sam never
existed. He's not meeting me halfway, here Jane and I can't be expected to do
all the work. I'm trying but he has to try too." </p>
<p>"All right, calm down. I'll try to talk to him tonight, see if I can get
through to him myself. In the meantime, grab a snack, please. Sam asked me to
keep an eye on you so I am. Plus I care about you as well. Don't do this,
Brooke, it won't help." Brooke glared at her and pulled away. </p>
<p>"Whatever, enjoy dinner," she snapped as she crawled down into Sam's bed.
Jane sighed and left the room. </p>
<center>
<p>**</p>
</center>
<p>Two weeks later, Jane couldn't stand it anymore and picked up the phone.
Enough was enough. It was picked up on the third ring. </p>
<p>"Brahm residence, Sam speaking, whatcha want? Because we ain't buying," Sam
answered in typical Sam fashion. </p>
<p>"Sam, it's Mom," Jane said hastily into the phone. </p>
<p>"What's wrong, Mom?" Sam asked, instantly picking up on the bad vibes coming
through her mother's voice. "What's wrong with Brooke?" </p>
<p>"She's at it again, Sam. You need to come home before she's too far gone this
time." </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Section 7: Dad - Ghosts And Camels">
<p>Brooke sat on Sam's bed in the dark, knees drawn up to her chest crying. It
was a familiar pattern. She had spent most of her time in a similar fashion in
the three weeks Sam had been gone. No one, not Nicole, her father or Jane, Mary
Cherry, Sugar, Josh or Lily had been able to coax the poor girl out of her
self-imposed coccoon. </p>
<p>She had gotten somehow impossibly thinner; refusing-absolutely, catagorically
to eat unless forced and would not go back to the Eating Disorder Clinic. She'd
refused that too, verbally, physically, loudly and viciously. Mike had never
seen such behavior from his daughter before, she no longer acted or looked like
the little girl he raised. </p>
<p>Her natural grace was gone, replaced by movements that were forced, awkward
and stiff. The friendly, easy going girl had disappeared and in her place was a
rude, brooding emotionless machine that never smiled. Her normally glowing
complexion was now waxy pale with deep circles under her eyes and shadows
accentuated her already highlighted cheekbones. Her once luxurious blonde hair
was now only a pale yellow with none of the lift or vitality it once had. And
what was worse than all of that, were her eyes. It is said that the eyes are the
windows to the soul but anyone looking into the formally brilliant, intellegent,
sparkling hazel eyes of Brooke McQueen would see only one thing- Brooke
McQueen's soul no longer resided within. It had left the same day Sam McPherson
did. </p>
<p>So she showed no outward signs of reacting when she heard a car door slam
followed by the opening and closing of the front door. </p>
<p>(Jane must be home from work early) </p>
<p>She ignored the way the hair on the back of her neck stood on end. </p>
<p>(Must be a storm rolling in) </p>
<p>She listened to the hurried footfalls on the stairs but chalked it up to
imagination. It wasn't until the door nearly flew off its hinges that she
realized that the sound was real. </p>
<p>There stood the storm in question, Sam, in a pair of jeans and a baggy
t-shirt, her hair a few inches shorter and looking thinner herself. But there
she stood in the flesh. And anyone who saw her would be able to describe her
with one word: furious. Her normally brown eyes were almost red with fury and
her entire body shook from barely surpressed emotion. </p>
<p>"Sam?" Brooke squeaked, her voice catching on the one note. Sam focused on
her with an almost feral intensity. Any urge Brooke had to leap over and hold
the girl in the doorway was effectively crushed by the look on Sam's face. She
had never seen the journalist so upset, upset with her before. And given their
less than happy history, that was saying a lot. </p>
<p>"What the Hell game are you playing at, McQueen?" Sam asked, her badly missed
voice coming out more as a growl. Brooke shrugged mutely, unable to keep Sam's
heated gaze and curled up into a tighter ball. </p>
<p>"Do you know what it's like to get a phone call from Mom telling me that
you're slowly killing yourself? Jesus, Brooke," Sam spat angrily before she
could stop herself. Brooke hid her head behind her arms and started to cry
harder. </p>
<p>Sam sighed to herself. (Gee, Sam, nice job. Make her feel worse, why don't
you? This is so not going well) She hadn't meant to yell but she's been so
scared about what Brooke was doing to herself after she spoke to her mother on
the phone the day before. And then she saw how Brooke actually looked. She
reminded Sam of a Humane Society puppy, lost, malnourished and about to be put
down when all it really needed was love. And she had done this to Brooke. She
silently cursed herself for her cowardly behavior, then Mike for setting them up
like dominos to fall over. She took a deep breath to calm herself and cautiously
approached the bed. </p>
<p>"Brooke?" she whispered in a calmer voice. No response. "Brooke, please look
at me." Still, Brooke didn't respond. "I'm sorry I yelled like that. I didn't
mean to, I'm just worried." This won her a long sniffle from the emaciated
cheerleader. Sam sat on the edge of the bed. "Look, I can leave and come back in
if you want but all I really wanted was to say `Hi'." </p>
<p>Brooke lifted her head and fixed her tear-filled, bloodshot eyes on Sam. With
a thin trembling hand, she reached out and poked Sam in the shoulder. </p>
<p>"Real?" she hiccuped. Sam smiled. </p>
<p>"As a heart attack, babe," at which point Brooke launched herself into Sam's
embrace and sobbed uncontrollably. "Shhh.take it easy before you hurt yourself,"
Sam soothed. Brooke just held on for all she was worth. Sam could feel nearly
every bone in Brooke's body through both their clothes and it scared her. </p>
<p>"God, Brooke, you're so thin. Why do you do this to yourself?" she asked as
her own tears raced down her face. Brooke tried to pull away but Sam held on
tight. </p>
<p>"No, don't pull away from me. I didn't come all the way home to have you pull
away from me and shut me out." </p>
<p>"Why did you come home?" Brooke asked as she settled into Sam's arms and
played with the damp collar of Sam's t-shirt. </p>
<p>"Mom called and said you weren't eating. She figured since no one else could
get through to you, she'd better call in the big gun, me. So I came back. Now
stop evading the question, why do you do this to yourself? God knows you were
thin enough already. Actually, you could have stood to gain a little, Skinny
Minnie," Sam joked lightly. Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"I don't know. I just haven't been hungry. Food tastes funny lately," she
answered lamely. </p>
<p>"Look, you have four jobs, responsibilities to stay alive in this life: eat,
sleep, breathe, and love me. They're not hard, although I know that last one can
be at times." This got her a small smile from Brooke. "But why do you do this to
yourself and more importantly, why do you do this to me?" Sam finished as new
tears slipped down her face and her voice faded away. Brooke frowned in
confusion. </p>
<p>"'Do this to you'? This isn't about you," she argued hotly. Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"In a way, yes it is. You're seeking to control something, anything because
you feel like you're out of control. Mike went totally ballistic when he found
out about us and for once in your life you didn't get your own way. There was
nothing you could do to stop the downward spiral we somehow found ourselves on.
Then you saw how it was threatening to destroy his and Mom's relationship and
neither of us wanted that but nothing we did helped that either. And then I took
away the one safe and secure thing you had left, me. I didn't realize it at the
time, I was only trying to make things better. But you were drowning and I took
away your life preserver. I am so sorry." </p>
<p>"That's still all me," Brooke pointed out. </p>
<p>"Until you factor in the fact that whether it was conscious or not, you knew
that if you pulled this anorexia thing, someone would eventually call me and I'd
come running like a dog when you yank its chain." </p>
<p>"This isn't an `anorexia thing', Sam. It's a disease, like cancer, AIDS, or
alcoholism. And you have a pretty poor opinion of yourself if you think of
yourself as a dog on a chain," Brooke hissed. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"If the analogy fits." she trailed off at the glare she got from her irate
girlfriend. "And I know it's a disease, Brooke. I was in no way belittling it,
or you. But you did this, on some level, to get back at your dad for his Puritan
reaction to us and to get back at me for leaving you. And that hurts," Sam said,
her voice showing exactly how much. </p>
<p>If Brooke didn't feel bad enough already, that comment just about finished
her off. She hadn't meant to hurt Sam, really, she had just hurt so badly
herself that she was acting out the only way she really knew how. And, yes, the
vindictive, meanspirited part of her knew how much starving herself would hurt
her father and she wanted nothing more than to make him suffer as much as she
was suffering. </p>
<p>It was also the only real way she had of expressing the deep emotional pain
she was in. Crying wasn't doing it; it only made her tired and her eyes raw.
Screaming was a waste of energy and while she toyed with the idea of cutting,
her vanity, such as it was, wouldn't let her take the chance of accidentily
scarring herself. So she reverted back to form, her one vice and disorder,
anorexia. </p>
<p>"I never meant to hurt you, Sammy," she sobbed, clinging to Sam desperately.
Sam kissed the top of her head and smoothed her hair down. </p>
<p>"I know that, Brooke. I know. I'm here now and this is going to stop," Sam
said confidently. She brought Brooke's face up for a kiss full of longing,
regret, love and promise. Instantly Brooke began to feel better. Sam got up off
the bed and smoothed her shirt. </p>
<p>"OK, McQueen, here's the deal. Take a shower, because, as much as I love you,
you smell like an unwashed camel in the Sahara at high noon in the middle of
August," Brooke scrunched her nose at the imagery and then sniffed her shirt.
</p>
<p>(Ew, she's right!) </p>
<p>"Then," Sam continued with a smile as she watched Brooke's actions. "By the
time you're done, I'll have your bags packed and we can get the Hell out of
Dodge City." </p>
<p>Brooke was now pressed up against the headboard again, her eyes full of anger
and betrayal. Sam frowned at her confused. </p>
<p>"What?" Brooke's eyes narrowed and turned to ice. </p>
<p>"I am not going back to the Clinic and not even YOU can make me," she growled
in a barely recognizable voice. Sam looked at her, surprised at the amount of
venom that was just spewed in her direction. Brooke sounded like a cat whose
tail was caught in the door. Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"I know that, Brooke," she said softly. "And as much as I wish you would go,
I'll never make you do something you don't want to." Brooke visibly relaxed. Sam
leaned over the bed putting her arms down to support her weight and making it so
she was nose to nose with Brooke. </p>
<p>"No, I know you won't go to the Clinic. But you can't stay here and fade
away. I won't allow it. So you and me, love, are going on a road trip." Brooke's
eyes got wide. </p>
<p>"What about my Dad?" Sam rolled her eyes and huffed. </p>
<p>"The Nazi?" Sam grinned. Brooke nodded. Sam kissed the end of her nose making
her giggle. "I cleared this with Mom. She'll deflect him, run interference and
any other sports reference I don't know or care to understand." Brooke pulled
her into another fierce hug. </p>
<p>"I missed you so much. Don't ever leave me again, Sammy," she begged. Sam
hugged her back. </p>
<p>"I missed you too, Brooke. And I promise I won't ever leave again. Ever.
Nothing short of death will ever make me leave your side again." </p>
<p>"Don't talk about things like that," Brooke asked. "What are we going to do
about school?" </p>
<p>"You and me are officially on sabbatical. Mom's gonna deal with it. Now stop
worrying so much and go scrub up." </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Section 7: Dad - You Can Sleep While I Drive">
<p>Brooke emerged from the shower feeling refreshed and alive again for the
first time in three weeks. She found that Sam had finished packing as was
sitting patiently in the bed with a distant look on her face. She walked over
and ran her hands through Sam's shorter locks. </p>
<p>"Why'd you cut it, Sammy?" Sam purred at the scalp massage. </p>
<p>"For a change, I guess. It's only three inches and it'll grow back. You know,
new scenery, new look. Don't worry, I hate it too." Brooke smiled wryly. </p>
<p>"I don't hate it, I think it makes you look elfish," Sam arched an eyebrow.
"As much as I love your hair long, I like it this way too." Sam smiled back and
her eyes finally focused in the present. Brooke wondered where her mind had
actually been. </p>
<p>"Ready to go, Brooke?" Brooke nodded </p>
<p>"As long as you've packed my stuff. Where we headed?" Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Uh-uh, it's a surprise. You'll find out when we get there, trust me," Brooke
leaned in and kissed her. </p>
<p>"Always," she promised. </p>
<center>
<p>**</p>
</center>
<p>Brooke fell asleep not long after they left the Palace and Sam was glad. She
wasn't really up to conversation, or more accurately explainations. The past
three weeks without Brooke had without a doubt been the worst of her young life.
She'd made a horrible mistake in leaving, she knew that now. She needed no other
proof than to look at the frail form curled up into a small ball in the
passenger seat next to her. She's just been so sure that it was the right thing
to do and now the guilt and doubt were gnawing at her like insistant persistant
hunger pains. (Cute analogy, Sam. You are just SO damn witty. I hate myself) She
sighed and turned the radio on low for company and to try and drown out her own
thoughts. </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">(Under a blackened sky <br/>
Far beyond the glaring streetlights <br/>
Sleeping on empty dreams <br/>
The vultures lie in wait </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">You lay down beside me then <br/>
You were with me every waking hour <br/>
So close I could feel your breath </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">When all we wanted was the dream <br/>
To have and to hold that precious little thing <br/>
Like every generation yields <br/>
A newborn hope unjaded by their years </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Pressed up against the glass <br/>
Found myself wanting sympathy <br/>
But to be consumed again <br/>
Oh I know would be the death of me </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">And there is a love that's inherently given <br/>
The kind of blindness often to appease <br/>
In the light of forbidden joy <br/>
Oh I know I won't receive it </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">When all we wanted was the dream <br/>
To have and to hold that precious little thing <br/>
Like every generation yields <br/>
A newborn hope unjaded by their years </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">You know if I leave you now <br/>
It doesn't mean that I love you any less <br/>
It's just the state that I'm in <br/>
I can't be good to anyone else like this </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">When all we wanted was the dream <br/>
To have and to hold that precious little thing <br/>
Like every generation yields <br/>
A newborn hope unjaded by their years) </font> </p>
<p>The words somehow struck Sam as appropriate in some ironic and sardonic sort
of way. That was her and Brooke, trying to avoid the vultures and yet trying to
hold on to the precious thing that they had, their dream of themselves. And yet
it was taken away by Mike and then she had left Brooke. It just seemed to her
that she was doing more harm than good being home. (How did Brooke interpret my
leaving? Did she feel abandoned? Unloved? That was never my intention. Why can't
I ever seem to do anything right? I seem to destroy everything I touch. Reverse
Midas touch, everything I come into contact with turns to dust) </p>
<p>"Sam?" Brooke's groggy voice filtered over to her, breaking her from her
thoughts. Sam glanced over as Brooke unfolded herself and stretched as much as
she could in the cramped seat. </p>
<p>"Did I wake you with the radio, love?" Sam whispered. Brooke shook her head.
</p>
<p>"No. I didn't mean to fall asleep on you," Brooke yawned. Sam smiled and
shrugged. </p>
<p>"Sometimes sleep is best," she said plainly as she watched for her exit.
Brooke watched her closely in confusion. She wasn't sure but it seemed to her
that Sam was shutting her out. Sam saw her staring and frowned. "What?" </p>
<p>"What's wrong?" Brooke asked seriously and to the point. Sam's frown
deepened. </p>
<p>"Nothing's wrong, Brooke. I'm concentrating on driving," Sam responded a
little shortly. Brooke wasn't buying that but decided not to push it any further
right now. There'd be plenty of time for talking when they got to whereever it
was they were going. Speaking of which. </p>
<p>"So, do I get any hints on where we're going?" Brooke asked lightly. Sam
seemed to relax at the change of subject and smiled a bit. </p>
<p>"Nope. But I will tell you that it's exactly what we need to heal. Both of
us," she said firmly and confidently. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"All right, I believe you. How was San Francisco?" Brooke asked as she came
fully awake. Sam sighed. This is what she was hoping to avoid. She really wasn't
in a talkative mood but knew she had to say something or Brooke would know she
had something on her mind. </p>
<p>"It was OK," she answered with a shrug. "It sucked because you weren't with
me though," she stated honestly. And it had. All the cool things she had seen or
the places she'd been to didn't mean a thing because the blonde who had her
heart wasn't there to share it with her. </p>
<p>"I missed you," Brooke repeated her earlier sentiment. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Ditto, Brooke." </p>
<p>"Dad's gonna flip when he finds me gone," Brooke reminded her with a devilish
grin. Sam echoed the grin. </p>
<p>"Yup," she agreed. She hated the idea of leaving her mother to deal with that
particular mess but they both agreed that this was their only option for helping
Brooke. And whatever it took, Sam was willing to do. </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Section 7: Dad - The Hideaway">
<p>"Sammy, it's beautiful," Brooke breathed when she got out of the car and
looked around. And it was. Sam had taken them far off the beaten path to a wood
cabin on a crystal clear blue lake far into the woods. All around them were
trees and water and wildlife. No cars, cellphones, traffic or other
distractions. It was life, pure and simple. Sam got out of the car and smiled.
</p>
<p>"Yes, it is. The cabin used to belong to my Dad but Mom and I sold it to a
friend after he died. He's letting me borrow it for a while," she explained as
she got their bags out of the trunk. "The cabin is fully stocked and has all the
amenities of home except a phone or TV. But we do get a radio station and cell
reception out here if we need to call home or they need us." </p>
<p>"And Mom knows we're here?" Brooke asked as she went to help Sam with the
bags. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Yup. I threw the idea at her and she cleared it with Bill, the guy who owns
the cabin now. Anyway, let's get the bags inside and I'll show you around." </p>
<p>They set up their stuff inside and again Brooke was awestruck by the simple
beauty of the cabin. Two stories and made completely out of logs, it had a
kitchen, dining room, a livingroom and bathroom downstairs and three bedrooms
upstairs. There was a screened in porch overlooking the lake downstairs as well
with a perfect view of the sky. </p>
<p>"This was always my favorite room," Sam said as she joined Brooke on the
porch. "I used to grab my sleeping bag and lay out on the floor and stare up at
the stars until I fell asleep." Brooke wrapped her arms around Sam's waist and
was surprised when she felt Sam stiffen slightly. (What is going on with you,
Sammy?) Sam tilted her head to look at her. </p>
<p>"Come on, I'll show you outside." </p>
<center>
<p>**</p>
</center>
<p>"We can go swimming, fishing, canoeing, anything you want," Sam continued
their tour with Brooke holding firmly onto her hand. "And about a half mile that
way," she pointed to her right, "is a stream that my Dad used to take me to all
the time. We'd fish and talk, just hang out, you know?" Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Does it look like the place from your coma?" she asked. They both had
stronger memories of that visit now. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"Yes and no. I suppose it does but it was distorted by a child's view, you
know?" </p>
<p>"We'll have to walk over and see what it looks like now," Brooke suggested.
Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"We will when you're a little stronger," she said softly. Brooke pulled away.
</p>
<p>"I'm not made of glass, you know," she said hotly. Sam sighed and looked
away. </p>
<p>"I know, Brooke. But you're not healthy either," she answered quietly. Brooke
felt her anger rise at Sam's subded answer. </p>
<p>"Neither are you!" she screamed at Sam. Sam picked her head up to look at
her. "Or did you think I wouldn't notice? God, Sam, I may have starved my body
but you seemed to have starved your soul! You won't let me near you without
flinching! What's wrong?" She was crying now but Sam just shook her head. </p>
<p>"Nothing," she shrugged. She really didn't want to get into this now. "I just
want you to get well, Brooke." Sam turned to walk back to the cabin but Brooke
reached out and grabbed her arm in a deceptively strong grip. </p>
<p>"Don't turn away from me, Sam! Talk to me, let me in those walls you've built
back up, please," she begged. Sam just blinked at her blankly. "Please don't
close me out, Sammy." Sam reached up and cupped the side of Brooke's face with
her free hand. </p>
<p>"Never. But this is about getting you well again, not me. Besides, I'm fine,"
Brooke opened her mouth to protest but Sam moved her hand to cover it. "Don't. I
said I'm fine, so let it go. Come on, let's go inside and get a bite to eat."
Brooke stayed rooted to the spot. Sam tugged on her arm. </p>
<p>"Please, Brooke, for me?" Brooke glared at her for a few minutes before Sam
gave up with a sigh. "Fine, suit yourself. Stay out here while I cook dinner.
And yes, I did learn to cook while I was away. I promise not to poison you," she
joked weakly. She walked back to the cabin slowly, leaving Brooke on the grass
outside. "I'll call you when it's ready." </p>
<p>Brooke watched her go in silence wondering what exactly was going on. She was
so happy to see Sam again but Sam was so distant, so closed off it was like the
time spent apart had changed her. And that scared Brooke, she wanted her Sammy
to be as before. But she knew the reason they were here was to get back to that
place between them. And one of the ways that she could do that was to eat. Sam
was obviously worried about her and the only way to alieviate that worry was to
eat and get better and as much as the thought of eating repulsed her, she knew
it was the only way through to Sam. So she followed Sam into the cabin a few
minutes later determined to get through to her strangely distant love. </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Section 7: Dad - Thunder And Confessions">
<p>Thunder woke Brooke a week later. She rolled over to grab Sam in comfort but
found the bed beside her empty. Momentary fear that her nightmare of losing Sam
had come true flashed through her at the same time a flash of lightening
illuminated a silhouette in the window. Silently rolling out of bed, Brooke
padded over to the still form in the window and wrapped her arms around Sam from
behind. To her relief, Sam didn't pull away but settled in her arms. </p>
<p>"Not sleeping again?" she asked her insomniac girlfriend. Sam shook her head.
It seemed to Brooke that Sam never slept anymore or when she did she woke in a
cold sweat with a barely contained scream on the tip of her tongue begging to be
released. It broke Brooke's heart and she didn't know what to do to help. She
was getting better but Sam wasn't and Sam wouldn't let her help. </p>
<p>"Go back to sleep, Brooke," Sam said softly. "I was just watching the storm."
Thunder punctuated Sam's words and Brooke couldn't help but think about how the
storm seemed to match what was going on with Sam herself. It wasn't raining yet
but there was thunder and lightening; Sam was calm but Brooke knew inside she
was being torn up by something. Eventually, both storms were going to break and
Brooke could only hope that all floodgates held. </p>
<p>"Talk to me, please, Sammy," Brooke asked gently. She heard Sam sigh. "I'm
losing you and I don't understand why." Sam turned around in Brooke's arms and
looked at her. Another flash of lightening lit up the room and Brooke could see
that Sam had been crying before she had woken up. She reached up and wiped away
the tears and watched as Sam's eyes closed and new tears leaked out. </p>
<p>"How are you losing me?" Sam croaked in confusion. "I don't understand, I'm
right here with you." Her eyes opened again and Brooke could see how lost Sam
was. Brooke felt her own tears beginning to well up. </p>
<p>"You're here but you're pushing me away, you won't let me close to you. Since
you got back, you've taken really good care of me but you won't let me do the
same for you. Look at me, Sam, don't I look better all ready?" Sam nodded. She
had to admit although it had only been a week; Brooke no longer looked like she
was at death's door. </p>
<p>"Dad really screwed us up. You left and I retreated into anorexia Hell, but
after you left, what did you do?" Sam shrugged. "I bet I know. You shut yourself
off so that you couldn't be hurt again. It's what you did after your Dad died.
It took me so long to get through those walls to you. And now you don't know how
to let me close again." Sam tried to push Brooke away but she wasn't able to
escape the cheerleader's grasp. </p>
<p>"See? You're doing it again because you know I'm right." </p>
<p>"Stop it, Brooke," Sam hissed as she struggled in Brooke's arms. But Brooke
was as relentless as the rain that was beginning to pound on the shingled roof.
</p>
<p>"No, you know what else? You haven't called me 'Princess' once since you came
home. That's your special name for me. It made me feel special, like I was
yours. You haven't made love to me since we got here. Don't you feel that way
for me anymore, Sammy? Don't you still love me?" Brooke's voice cracked as she
asked her greatest fear. Sam's eyes got wide in shock and hurt. "Cuz I still
love you despite my father and his insanity. Despite your leaving me," she added
with a whisper and she hung her head. A small sob escaped Sam's lips before she
could stop it. Brooke looked to see Sam shaking her head violently. </p>
<p>"I still love you, oh God help me, I still love you," Sam cried desperately.
"You are my Princess but I can't do this anymore, Brooke, I'm not strong enough.
I don't have the answers I thought I did. I thought going to San Francisco was
the right thing to do and Jesus I nearly killed you!" This time she succeeded in
pulling away from Brooke and backed away like a wounded and frightened animal.
</p>
<p>"I nearly killed you," she repeated in a hiss, her eyes darting around the
room. "Because I thought I was right. I thought I had the answers. My foolish
pride and arrogance almost damned you! I won't let it happen again. I won't let
you close enough for it to happen again. I love you too much. I won't cost you
your Dad, I won't cost my Mom her marriage or Mac her father, and I sure as Hell
won't cost you your life!" Brooke stared at her incredulously. </p>
<p>"That makes absolutely no sense," Brooke said irritated. "You love me too
much to let me get close to you?" Sam nodded. "You stupid ass!" Sam jumped in
surprise. "You didn't have all the answers so you're going to give up on
everything? On me? You were wrong, is that it?" Sam nodded. "Welcome to the
fucking human race, Samantha McPherson! You can't be right all the time, you
stupid ass!" Sam just stared at her in shock and confusion. </p>
<p>"And it wasn't the wrong answer," Brooke continued a little calmer. "You
wanted to give Dad a little space to figure this out. OK, I understand that.
What was wrong was leaving without saying good-bye to me. THAT was wrong." Sam
bowed her head. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry," she choked through her tears. Brooke crossed the space between
them and gathered the crying girl into her arms. </p>
<p>"I know you are but shutting me out now is the wrong answer. I need you now
more than ever. And you need me whether you want to admit it or not," Brooke
told her softly. </p>
<p>"I do need you, so much," Sam admitted as she grabbed the cheerleader in a
desperate embrace. Brooke's heart felt a thousand times lighter at hearing this.
</p>
<p>"Then let me in, Sam. Whether or not Dad learns to accept us, I don't care
anymore all I care about is having you by my side. I love you Samantha
McPherson. And to Hell with everything else." Sam sniffled and looked at her
blonde girlfriend. </p>
<p>"You don't hate me for leaving?" she asked fearfully. Brooke sighed, finally
understanding Sam's behavior. The thought that Brooke must hate her for leaving
like her mother had must have been tearing Sam up inside. Brooke shook her head.
</p>
<p>"Of course not, I just told you that I love you," Brooke reassured her
lovingly. </p>
<p>"I love you too, Princess," Sam breathed with a sigh of relief. Brooke
brushed Sam's hair out of her face and tugged her towards the bed. </p>
<p>"Think maybe you can sleep now?" Sam looked doubtfully at the bed. </p>
<p>"I don't sleep much anymore," she admitted. Brooke cocked her head to the
side in confusion and worry. </p>
<p>"Why?" she asked with a frown. Sam shrugged and looked away. </p>
<p>"I dunno," Sam lied and Brooke saw right though it. </p>
<p>"Liar," Brooke accused. Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"Fine, nightmares. I still have some nightmares, OK, happy?" she asked
angrily. Brooke's frowned deepened. </p>
<p>"Why would I be happy that you're having nightmares?" </p>
<p>"That's not what I meant, Princess. I meant are you happy that I admitted
it?" Sam clarified. </p>
<p>"Oh. In that case, yes. Very. But unhappy that you're having nightmares at
all. Tell you what, you lay down and I'll watch over you in case of nightmares."
Sam rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Oooh, my own living dreamcatcher, huh? Brooke, how about we just go to
sleep?" Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"OK, but if you have a nightmare, you wake me and tell me, OK?" Sam nodded.
</p>
<p>"OK," she relented letting Brooke lead her to the bed and laying down next to
her. She curled up close to Brooke, against her chest, taking the comfort being
offered and let her eyes drift shut despite her fear of her nightmares. Brooke
could feel Sam shaking. </p>
<p>"It's OK, Sam," she whispered. "Sleep." </p>
<p>"I'm scared," Sam admitted. Brooke held her tighter. </p>
<p>"I'm here and I love you, Sammy. Nothing can hurt you," Brooke soothed. She
listened as Sam's breathing became deep and even and she knew the girl had
fallen asleep. It wasn't long after that she too drifted off. </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Section 7: Dad - A Compass Always Points North">
<p>Sam looked over at Brooke sunning herself on the dock a few days later and
smiled. (Damn that girl is sexy) she thought to herself, her smile widening.
(And all mine too. What did I ever do right to deserve her?) </p>
<p>"Enjoying the sun, Princess?" Sam asked as she walked over to Brooke's
lawnchair. Brooke opened one eye and squinted at her jeans and t-shirt clad
lover who was also wearing a backpack. </p>
<p>"Yup. Aren't you hot, Sammy?" Brooke asked. She was in a bathing suit sunning
herself while Sam looked ready for farm work. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Nah," Sam answered. "I'm going on a hike, wanna come?" Brooke's eyes got
wide and she all but sprung from her chair. </p>
<p>"Give me a sec to change and I'll be right with you," she dashed for the
cabin, knowing where Sam was hiking to. They'd put it off until they both felt
better and Brooke was ecstatic that Sam finally felt like hiking to the stream.
She pulled on a pair of sweats over her suit and a tee and sneakers and ran out
the door to where Sam waited smiling. </p>
<p>"Ready to go, Princess?" she extended her hand which Brooke gladly took. </p>
<p>"When you are," she answered. Sam pulled her in for a passionate kiss and
then started walking. They walked in compatable silence for a while before Sam
started talking. </p>
<p>"Used to be when my Dad took me on this hike, he'd tell me stories about
these woods," she started, her eyes glancing around her in remembrance. Brooke
watched Sam as she went through her memories of her father, knowing how precious
the memories were to Sam and honored that Sam was sharing them with her. </p>
<p>"He'd tell me stories about Indians, oops, excuse me, Native Americans," Sam
grinned at her. "And bears and cougars. I don't know if he made them up or what
but I just loved to hear his voice. It just sort of echoed above the trees and
whirled all around us until we were the only two people on the planet." </p>
<p>"Like yours is now," Brooke whispered as she pulled up close to Sam. Sam
laughed slightly and held on tighter to Brooke's hand. </p>
<p>"Yeah, I guess so. Anyway, I could just listen to him for hours. He'd tell me
stories about when he was little and about what it was like before I was born.
And then he'd tell me about the things that we were going to do when I got old
enough," her voice took on a sad tone for a moment and Brooke's heart broke for
her and what she had lost. </p>
<p>"It made the walk seem shorter. You know how long walks seemed when you were
little? You just wanted to GET there, but not with my Dad. Not when he was
telling one of his stories. It always seemed that we got there too soon." </p>
<p>"Mom never went with you?" Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, she called it `our time', Dad and me. She'd stay at the cabin and cook
or something and let us have the afternoon." </p>
<p>"That was really sweet of her," Sam nodded. They crested a small hill and
Brooke realized that they were there. (Seems Sam has the same talent her father
did) </p>
<p>Below them was the field that she had seen when God had let her visit Sam
during her coma. And it was even more beautiful in real life than it had been in
the limbo of Sam's coma. There was a lush green field through the middle of
which ran a small stream with a small wooden bridge. </p>
<p>"Wow, Sam, I don't think you distorted it at all," Brooke breathed. When Sam
didn't answer her, she tore her eyes away from the gorgeous view to check on her
brunette girlfriend and found her crying silently. </p>
<p>"What's wrong Sam?" Brooke asked suddenly worried. Sam turned to her and gave
her a brilliant smile despite her tears. </p>
<p>"Nothing. Absolutely nothing," she answered her smile never wavering. "I just
haven't been back since Dad died. I never wanted to. It's just like I remembered
it." Brooke realized the tears were tears of pure joy and hugged Sam tightly.
</p>
<p>"Come on, let's go down to the water," Brooke tugged on Sam's arm and pulled
her down the hill. They got to the water's edge and looked at their reflection.
For half a second, Sam swore she saw her father smiling back at her. She looked
around in surprise getting Brooke's attention. </p>
<p>"What, Sammy? What is it?" Sam looked around another second with a confused
frown but then shook her head and smiled. </p>
<p>"Nothing, just a memory, I guess," she shrugged. Brooke looked around. </p>
<p>"Too bad we didn't bring a blanket or something. This'd be a great place for
a picnic," she sighed. Sam looked at her and arched an eyebrow. </p>
<p>"Now, what kind of girlfriend would be if I didn't think of everything?" she
teased as she slipped the backpack off. She opened it and pulled out a small
blanket, which she set out on the ground with a flourish. Brooke smiled. </p>
<p>"My, my, aren't you the clever one?" she asked. Sam laughed. </p>
<p>"Wait, that's not all," she reached back into the bag and pulled out several
tupperware packets of food. "Lunch, milady?" she bowed. Brooke bowed back and
sat down as Sam set out the food and plates. Set out before her was a modest
lunch of chicken breast sandwiches, potato salad, corn chips and a couple of
sodas with fruit salad for dessert. Brooke smiled to herself, for all of her
anorexia problems, for Sam she was willing to try and get through it. </p>
<p>"Have I told you lately how much I love your cooking?" Brooke asked in all
seriousness after they finished eating. Sam blushed. "No, really, when did you
learn?" </p>
<p>"Well, it was out of necessity, actually. Brian and Jess Brahm aren't exactly
homebodies so it was either learn to cook or starve to death," Sam instantly
winced at her choice of words. Brooke reached over and covered her hand with her
own. </p>
<p>"It's OK, I understand what you meant," she said with an understanding smile.
"That explains why you resembled a stick figure when you busted in like
gangbusters that day." Sam's jaw dropped open and Brooke grinned. "Oh, like I'm
not gonna notice that you lost a few pounds. I happen to like where your curves
are, thank you." Sam blushed again. "You're so cute when you blush." </p>
<p>"Only when I blush?" Sam retorted with a smirk. Brooke snorted at her. </p>
<p>"OK, all the time, I admit it. You're beautiful, Sam," she whispered
seriously. Sam leaned across the blanket and kissed her. </p>
<p>"So are you, Brooke. I love you so much," Sam breathed almost as a prayer
making Brooke shiver. She grasped Sam's face in her hands and stared into Sam's
chocolate eyes with were looking back at her full of love and devotion. </p>
<p>"I love you too, Sam," she answered. She kissed her way along Sam's jawline
and heard Sam sigh in contentment. As they lay back on the blanet together,
hands beginning to explore, Sam pulled Brooke's face back up to look her in the
eye again. </p>
<p>"Are you sure about this, Brooke?" she asked, voice full of love and concern.
Brooke smiled and placed a gentle kiss on Sam's lips. </p>
<p>"If you are," she answered back. The searing kiss that ignited every nerve
ending in her body she got in response erased any doubt in Brooke's mind. </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Section 7: Dad - Meanwhile Back At The Ranch">
<p>"You're going to lose them both, you know," Jane snapped at Mike over her
plate of pasta. Mike glared back at her. </p>
<p>"I told you I didn't want to have this discussion. If you won't tell me where
my own daughter is, then we aren't going to have this discussion," he answered
in the same peevish tone. This was life at the Palace without Brooke and Sam.
Meet Mr. and Mrs. Bitch-A-Lot. Mike and Jane could barely stand to be in the
same room together let alone talk. It was a sorry statement concerning their
engagement and Jane was seriously wondering who the Hell it was she was engaged
to and why. She set her fork down with a slam and looked back at Mike. </p>
<p>"Tough. You stand to lose more than Brooke and Sam if you keep this up. As
much as I love you, I can't stand the way you're behaving," she admitted
angrily. Mike huffed at her. </p>
<p>"I'm behaving? You're the one promoting this depraved behavior between our
daughters!" Jane rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"You can't help who you fall in love with, Mike. Jesus, look at us," she
pointed out. </p>
<p>"What the Hell does that mean?" </p>
<p>"Do you rememeber how the girls reacted to our announcement about our
relationship?" Mike nodded. "They acted like we did it just to spite them and
get at them for something. Sound familiar?" Mike turned red. </p>
<p>"But we're in love! How can you call what they have love, Jane?" </p>
<p>"How can you presume to know how they feel?" her voice was beginning to rise
and in the back of her mind she wondered if the neighbors were enjoying the
show. </p>
<p>"If you remember, Jane, those two HATED each other and now they profess to
LOVE each other. I don't see it. I won't accept it!" Mike continued. </p>
<p>"Why? Because they're girls? Because if that's it I think you need to fast
forward and join the rest of us in the 21st century, Mike. Homosexuality is no
longer in the closet. It isn't something whispered about, hidden or something
that happens to someone else's family member. It could be anyone and it isn't
something to be ashamed about anymore. Damn it, the stigma attached is being
chipped away little by little every day. Those two girls were brave and honest
by coming forward and telling you when they could have just snuck around behind
your back forever. God knows you're thick enough that you probably never would
have noticed!" Mike stood up, sending his chair flying. </p>
<p>"I'm not you Jane," he said lowly. "I can't just be OK with this." Jane
rubbed her eyes. </p>
<p>"I'm not asking you to fly a rainbow flag outside the house and march in the
God Damn parade Mike. I'm asking you to take a look at your daughter, Mike. A
good look and see what your reaction is doing to her. She stopped eating again
and we both know that this time, if Sam can't get through to her, we're going to
lose her." Mike picked up his chair and sat back down heavily. Jane lowered her
voice and spoke softer. </p>
<p>"She loves you, Mike, your opinion means a lot to her. You're the only parent
she's had for most of her life and you turned on her and made her feel dirty,
ashamed, evil. And you made her feel that by loving Sam she had failed you.
Brooke is a very proud young lady who hates to fail." Mike buried his head in
his hands as Jane's words struck home. </p>
<p>"She's gay, Jane," he whispered. Jane nodded her head. </p>
<p>"Yes, she is. And she's still the same little girl you raised, that hasn't
changed. The only thing that has is that she loves Sam." He shook his head at
her. </p>
<p>"How can you be all right with that?" Jane gave him a half smile. </p>
<p>"Have you ever looked at the two of them? I mean really looked at them when
they're together and not trying to hide it from someone?" Mike shook his head.
Jane's smile grew. "It's beautiful, Mike. Honestly, you'd cry if you could see
the love between them. I know that sounds corny but it's true. It flows from
every pore of their bodies and it's pure and divine to witness. I've never seen
anything like it before. How can I begrudge something that's obviously so right
for them?" </p>
<p>"But.but." whatever argument Mike had was lost to him. "I'm going to lose her
either way, aren't I?" Jane nodded. </p>
<p>"If you don't get your head out of your ass, yes. And me and Mac too because
I'm not raising her in an intolerant atmosphere. It comes right down to this,
Mike: don't make me chose between you and Sam. Because you'll lose, every time."

<chapter title="Section 7: Dad - Reality Bites. So Bite Back">
<p>"We have to go home soon, you know," Sam lamented as she chewed on a blade of
grass and stared up at the dimming sky. Brooke lifted her head from where it had
been resting on Sam's shoulder and frowned. </p>
<p>"You sure know how to kill a Kodak moment," she complained before putting her
head back down. Sam stroked the blonde's hair gently. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry, it's just we can't stay here forever. As much as I wish we could,
we can't. Reality awaits our return," Sam pointed out. Brooke sighed and buried
her face in Sam's shoulder. </p>
<p>"I prefer this reality. You and me and this place. This is us, our place now,
Sammy," she said happily. Sam giggled. </p>
<p>"As much as I love being here with you and making love to you out here, I
think eventually other hikers might stumble upon us and that would be, oh,
what's the word.embarrassing?" Brooke laughed at what the look on said hikers
faces might be. </p>
<p>"So?" she challenged. "Let's buy the cabin from Bill and move out here and
never deal with my dad again," she suggested. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Again, tempting. But I think we've learned that running away is the wrong
answer. Besides, I think we run the risk of becoming little female versions of
the Unibomber or something if we do that. Not healthy. Besides, we're not the
ones with the problem. Mike and Harrison and Carmen are. If they can't deal, let
them leave, I'm through running." Brooke looked up into Sam's face and saw that
she meant it. </p>
<p>"Seriously?" she asked, just to be sure. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Yes, as long as I have you, Princess, nothing else matters. Everyone and
everything can go to Hell in a handbasket for all I care. Just be mine, Brooke,
that's all I ask," Sam said her eyes open and vulnerable. Brooke blinked away
the sudden tears that welled up at Sam's words. </p>
<p>"Forever, Sammy, without question," she vowed. Sam shifted so she could look
Brooke in the eye but so that Brooke was still leaning on her. A little
uncomfortable, but who cares? </p>
<p>"Forever yours, Princess," she said earnestly. "Whether or not anyone accepts
us. We'll simply move around until we find somewhere that does." Brooke's eyes
lit up. </p>
<p>"You mean it?" </p>
<p>"Of course, I would never lie to you when it's this important, love," Sam
smiled. Brooke's brow furrowed. </p>
<p>"Uhm, when would you lie to me?" she asked. (Saw that one coming) Sam laughed
to herself. </p>
<p>"I wouldn't," she half-lied. Brooke frowned at her. </p>
<p>"That, that was a lie," Brooke challenged playfully. Sam rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"OK, you know that pink and blue shirt you had?" Brooke nodded. "I'm the one
that shrunk it in the wash, not Mom. OK? That was a lie." Brooke reached out and
smacked her. </p>
<p>"I liked that shirt," she complained. </p>
<p>"Hey, I liked you in that shirt. It accentuated all the right things," Sam
answered winning herself another swat. "Sorry, geez, that was a compliment,
y'know." Brooke smiled and leaned in to lick at Sam's neck. Sam sighed happily.
</p>
<p>"Don't so that, we have to head back to the cabin before it gets too dark,"
Sam warned breathlessly. </p>
<p>"What's the matter, Sammy? `Fraid of getting lost?" Brooke asked huskily as
she continued, moving lower. Sam moaned. </p>
<p>"I'm not the one who's going to be complaining when it's too dark to see
where we're going and we hear something behind us," Sam pointed out although she
really was past the point of caring. She felt Brooke smile against her skin. </p>
<p>"Don't worry, I have my Big Bad Sammy to protect me," Brooke purred. </p>
<p>"Uh-huh, remember that when we're being eaten by wolves," Sam whispered. </p>
<p>"The only wolf I'm interested in's name is Sam." </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Section 7: Dad - What Goes Around Comes Around">
<p>Mike and Jane were waiting for them when they walked in the door. Sam felt
like she was walking in front of the firing squad, all she needed was a
blindfold and a cigarette. Brooke tightened her hold on Sam's hand as their
parents greeted them. </p>
<p>"Sam, Brooke, how was your trip?" Jane asked, relieved and pleasantly
surprised at how healthy Brooke looked even if Sam did still look a little tired
around the edges. She figured no one else would really notice beside maybe
Brooke but Jane was her mother after all and mothers notice these things. Brooke
gave a dazzling smile, a smile not seen in a very long time and answered. </p>
<p>"Terrific, Mom. That cabin is beautiful. It's too bad you and Sammy sold it
because it'd be a great place to visit from time to time," she beamed. Jane
smiled back. </p>
<p>"Well, Bill probably wouldn't mind renting it out to us every once in a
while," Jane suggested. She loved the way Brooke's eyes lit up at the thought.
(Nice job, Sam) Jane thought. </p>
<p>"Hi, Dad," Brooke said, a little more subdued. Mike nodded. </p>
<p>"Welcome home, Pumpkin," he said quietly. "Sam," he nodded at her. </p>
<p>"Hi, Mike," Sam said slightly confused that Mike even acknowledged her as she
and Brooke hugged her mother hello. Brooke took the welcome from Mike as
positive and hugged him as well. </p>
<p>"You look good, Brooke," Mike commented. Brooke frowned for a second but it
faded as quickly as it appeared. </p>
<p>"Sam took really good care of me, Dad. She's become a pretty good cook," she
explained. Jane arched an eyebrow at Sam. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"Mom, Brian and Jess aren't great cooks," she pointed out. Jane nodded. </p>
<p>"I see. Well, it's still great to see you both looking so good," Jane
repeated Mike's comment. Both Sam and Brooke rolled their eyes. </p>
<p>"Did we miss anything good?" Sam asked to change the subject. </p>
<p>"Not really. Lily, Josh and Nicole have asked about you and you'll be
surprised to hear so have Harrison and Carmen," Jane informed them. Their eyes
got wide. </p>
<p>"No way!" Sam exclaimed. </p>
<p>"Nu-uh," Brooke said at the same time. Jane laughed. </p>
<p>"Apparently absence does make the heart grow fonder. They feel really bad
about they way they acted and want a chance to talk to you." Sam shot a look at
Brooke. </p>
<p>"Think we should make them sweat it out a while longer?" she asked. Brooke
nodded. </p>
<p>"Oh, definitely," she agreed. Mike cleared his throat and everyone looked at
him. </p>
<p>"I want to get a few things straight," Sam had to surpress the ironic giggle
that threatened to make itself known at his choice of words. Out of the corner
of her eye, she saw both Brooke and Jane trying, unsuccessfully to hide smirks.
It didn't help her to swallow the giggle and Mike glared at her. </p>
<p>"Jane and I had a very long talk and I don't want to lose either of you. I
care for you both but I am not OK with this relationship," he started. When he
saw all three mouths open to protest, he raised a hand to stop them. He was
dimly and guiltily aware that at least one of them flinched at the action. "I
just want to say that while I'm not OK with it, I won't try to put a stop to it
either. But there are rules while you live in this house. This is MY house. You
will live by MY rules. I don't want to see it, or hear it, understood?" Two
heads, one blonde, one brunette nodded. </p>
<p>"Now that doesn't mean that you can't hold hands or that sort of thing. I am
not an ogre, contrary to my past behavior. I'm just asking that you not flaunt
it in my face." </p>
<p>"Basically don't singe your eyebrows by flaming?" Sam asked trying to lighten
the mood. Brooke elbowed her in the ribs. Mike frowned at her for a second
before actually smiling. </p>
<p>"Yes, Sam, please don't set fire to the household furnishings," he attempted
to joke. Everyone smiled. "Welcome home." </p>
<center>
<p>**</p>
</center>
<p>Sam and Brooke returned to school the following Monday to a slew of questions
from Lily, Josh, and Nicole. They couldn't believe that Mike had welcomed them
home. </p>
<p>"It was bizzare but I guess Mom got through to him," Sam said as they stood
at the lockers. </p>
<p>"You look good, B," Nic commented. "Although if you ever pull that stunt
again, Spam is going to find herself a sudden widow," she warned. Brooke looked
suitably chagrined. </p>
<p>"Ah, the little lunchen meat without her Brooke, the horror," Sam sighed
dramatically while putting a hand to her forehead and pretending to faint. Nic
glared at her good-naturedly. </p>
<p>"Hi, Brooke, Hi Sam," Carmen said as she reached the locker. Five sets of
eyes, two blue, two brown, one hazel stared back at her silently. "Whoa, tough
crowd," she laughed nervously. Complete silence. "OK, would it help if I got
down on my knees and begged forgiveness?" </p>
<p>"Gee, I don't know, Carm, why don't you give it a try and we'll let you
know?" Nicole bit out. "And while you're down there, why don't you try licking
the scum off their shoes too since that's right about at the same level you are?
Actually, that's an insult to the scum." Brooke put her hand on Nicole's
shoulder to pull her back. It was like having your own rabid Versace clad
pitbull whose teeth were lined with sharp one-liners. </p>
<p>"Easy, Nic, let's hear her out," Brooke suggested getting raised eyebrows
from everyone including her girlfriend. "We owe her that much." </p>
<p>"Uhm, Brooke, we don't OWE her anything," Sam argued. "She went all militant
on US, remember?" Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"And I was wrong, Sam. Very wrong. I was just surprised is all," Carmen tried
to explain. </p>
<p>"It's been weeks, Carmen. What made you come around now? April Tuna finally
driving you mad?" Sam asked sarcastically. Carmen shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, I just realized that I missed you guys. I was wrong to act the way that
I did. I was only thinking about everyone else and not about the two of you and
I'm really sorry. And after you left I realized that I could really lose you
both over this if I didn't snap out of it." Carmen sighed. "I have nothing else
to say except that I'm sorry." Brooke looked at Sam who shrugged. </p>
<p>"It's not much, but it's a start," Brooke admitted. </p>
<p>"And we're not just going to forgive you overnight, Carm. You hurt us pretty
bad. But, I guess we can try," Sam paused and scanned the hallway. "Where's
Harrison? Mom said he'd called too." </p>
<p>"Hiding somewhere. He's avoiding you because he's afraid you'll lynch him on
sight." Sam snickered. </p>
<p>"Smart boy," she sneered. Brooke pinched her lightly. "Ow!" Brooke turned to
Carmen. </p>
<p>"Tell him that if he feels the same way you do to come and see us. We'll give
him the same deal. He just has to ask first." Sam stared at her incredulously.
</p>
<p>"Speak for yourself, Princess. He said some pretty mean stuff and I'm not
sure after that that I want him as a friend," she said bitterly. Brooke sighed.
She knew Sam had been hurt by Harrison's words but was disappointed that she
wouldn't let it go. </p>
<p>"You forgave her for turning you into a hood ornament," Brooke countered,
pointing at Nicole who paled and rolled her eyes. Sam gave her a sympathetic
look. "Why can't you forgive Harrison for what was essentially a normal reaction
for him?" Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"Argh, fine, alright, if he comes and gives an appropriate apology, I'll
THINK about it, OK?" Sam huffed. Brooke smiled, knowing that she won. Sam glared
at the smile. </p>
<p>"Thank you Sammy," she hugged Sam quickly so that no one outside their group
of friends would see. </p>
<p>"Yeah, sure whatever," Sam mumbled. "Can we like go to class and like, do the
learning thing now?" she asked impatiently. Everyone smiled. </p>
<p>"Spam, you are sooooo whipped," Nicole quipped. </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Section 7: Dad - A Little Fall Of Rain">
<p>Mike watched as Sam entered the kitchen, nodded a hello and went about making
herself a snack. He was unsure how to act around her, he had no idea what to
say. There was no denying anymore that what she and Brooke had was real and not
a passing fling, a plot, experimentation or phase, no matter how much he might
wish otherwise. It was genuine, sincere, deep and passionate and came from
somewhere deep within their souls. And it scared him. </p>
<p>He had seen the changes in his daughter without Sam when Sam left to give him
space to deal with the situation. A gesture he still thought of as mature and
left him with a new respect for the brunette reporter, despite his initial
over-the-top reaction to the whole situation. In spite of all he had said and
done, including raising his hand to her, Sam was still willing to give him what
he needed to adjust to the news. She had acted like a responsible mature adult
and he had acted like a first class ass. </p>
<p>But he had seen how Brooke had retreated into herself without Sam as her
anchor. She had begun to starve herself again as a way to regain control over
her life, control he had ripped away from her. Brooke had struggled her entire
life with her self-image, why Mike didn't know since she was everyone's ideal of
perfection, but Brooke was never happy or comfortable in her own skin. Unknown
to Mike, Sam made Brooke comfortable and happy with herself inside and out and
he threatened to take that safety away from her. </p>
<p>So she got thinner and sicker and he was powerless to help or stop her. And
finally he understood how she felt. While he was initially upset with Jane for
calling Sam and then letting the two teenage girls take off on a road trip, he
knew that Brooke's only hope for salvation this time lay with Sam. </p>
<p>He saw the girl who bounded in the door, hand in hand with Sam a week
earlier, refreshed, rejuvenated and reborn after her little vacation. He knew
Brooke's renewed health and strength was due to Sam. He had been so afraid that
he was really going to lose her to the anorexia this time. That this time there
would be no rescue for her. She would waste away to nothing, growing sicker,
thinner with each passing day until she slipped through his fingers and her poor
broken heart ceased to beat completely. He was aware that a lot of the blame
should that have happened would have rested squarely on his shoulders. </p>
<p>But the girl who came through that door was not the broken shadow of a girl
who had been haunting the house in weeks past. No, this girl absolutely glowed
with positive energy. The spark was back along with her natural grace, color and
personality, plus, much to everyone's immense relief, Sam had managed to put a
few pounds back onto Brooke's tall and lanky frame. Apparently Sam had picked up
some cooking skills while visiting San Francisco. </p>
<p>He watched as Sam finished making her pb&amp;amp;j (nothing beats the basics) and
decided that if nothing else, he at least owed her a thank you for saving
Brooke's life-again. </p>
<p>"Sam?" he said softly, causing her to jump in mild surprise. He'd barely
spoken to her since she and Brooke returned home. While he was no longer rude or
malicious, he wasn't exactly open either. </p>
<p>"Yeah?" she responded warily looking from Mike to the door as if judging
whether or not she could beat him to it. It made him sad to know that he now
evoked such a reaction from a girl he really did think of as another daughter.
</p>
<p>"Could you.would you mind sitting down with me for a while? I'd like to talk
to you," he fumbled but finally managed to ask. Sam looked at him strangely for
a minute but then shrugged. </p>
<p>"If you're about to go at me with both barrels, Mike, I gotta tell you, I'm
too tired to deal with it," she said sadly. Mike took a good look at her and saw
that she indeed looked more tired than usual lately. She looked beaten, defeated
even. Now he was confused. She had Brooke, her mother's blessing, even Harrison
and Carmen were coming around, he wasn't demanding her head on a platter and yet
she still looked like she'd lost her best friend. </p>
<p>"What's wrong, Sam? Why are you tired?" he asked genuinely concerned. She
gave him an annoyed look but saw that he was serious in his concern and then
sighed as she sat down. </p>
<p>"Look, between my nightmares and Brooke's, coming home to either find her or
my Mom in tears over this whole thing, dealing with school, you and my own crap,
I haven't had time to catch my breath, OK?" she snapped, frustrated. Mike nodded
in understanding. He hadn't made it easy for her that was for sure. And she was
trying so hard to take care of Brooke and Jane it was easy to see why she'd be
getting run down. Unknown to both of them, Brooke had come downstairs to get a
bottle of water and was standing outside the room out of sight listening. </p>
<p>"You take care of them but who takes care of Sam?" Sam stared at him in angry
shock. Her eyes narrowed. </p>
<p>"I take care of myself, Mike. Brooke and Mom do what they can but when it
comes down to it, Sam McPherson takes care of Sam McPherson." </p>
<p>"Lonely way to be," Mike pointed out. </p>
<p>"Worked great after Dad died," Sam shot back. </p>
<p>"You took great care of Brooke," Mike added gently. Sam's eyes softened. </p>
<p>"I love her, Mike. I know that bothers you but I'm done apologizing for
something I have nothing to feel sorry for. I wasn't going to stand by and watch
her disappear. Besides, she took care of me when I needed it after the
accident." </p>
<p>"Because she loves you," Mike said, not as a question but as a fact. Sam
stared at him speechless. "I still don't like it, Sam,it's not right." He saw
the spark of anger flash across Sam's brown eyes and held up his hand to ward
off the oncoming outburst. "Please, hear me out." </p>
<p>"But I love my daughter. And believe it or not, I care for you too. I may not
like it or think that it's right but I have realized a few things. 1) This isn't
going away or going to change no matter how much I rant or rave or wish
otherwise. What I see between you and Brooke is what I hope people see between
Jane and I. Pure, unadulterated love. 2) My daughter is gay and you didn't make
her that way. This is no twisted plot on your part to tear this family apart. I
accused you of destroying this family when I was the guilty party, Sam. I see
that now. 3) If I don't learn to accept or at least overlook this, I will lose
Brooke, Jane and Mac. And you, Sam. Everything. Because of petty ignorance and
prejudice. I'll be alone with no one to blame but myself." Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Harsh realizations, aren't they?" she asked seriously. </p>
<p>"You gave me the space and chance to make them, Sam. Thank you. And you saved
my baby girl from destroying herself. I owe you for that. Again thank you." </p>
<p>"I love her, Mike, more than you can imagine. It killed me to leave her like
that," a few tears fell down Sam cheeks as she spoke and were unknowingly
mirrored on Brooke's who sat on the floor outside the kitchen door, still
listening. </p>
<p>"Why did you, if it hurt so much?" </p>
<p>"I couldn't let her lose you because of me. Do you know what it's like to
know that the two people you love most in the world are losing everything
because they love you back?" Mike shook his head guiltily. "Yeah, well it sucks
big time." </p>
<p>"How long have you loved Brooke?" Mike asked, wanting and needing to
understand Sam's feelings for Brooke. Sam looked at him for a minute but seemed
to understand where the question was coming from. And she was glad that he was
willing to ask, it meant that he was beginning to travel the road to accepting
it. </p>
<p>"A long time. Before the accident, I know that much. I don't know when my
feelings went from hostile to passionate exactly. I just know that I can't see
my life without her anymore," she said honestly. </p>
<p>"Is that why you pushed her out of the way of the car?" Sam shook her head
with a smile. </p>
<p>"I love that question," she said dryly. "Yes and no. Yes because I would
never be able to see harm come to Brooke if it were in my power to prevent it.
If it meant giving my life to save hers, OK fine. I'd die happy in the knowledge
that Brooke would wake up to face another day. And no, because no one deserves
to get hit with an expensive luxury vehicle, or any car for that matter. Hell, I
probably would have done the same thing for anyone, even Nicole." </p>
<p>"Even knowing the pain you'd go through?" Mike asked, slightly confused. </p>
<p>"Eh, pain is temporary, love is forever," Sam said with a wide smile,
repeating her father's message. She looked at Mike seriously and the smile
faded. </p>
<p>"Do you understand what your daughter means to me?" Mike sighed. </p>
<p>"I think I'm beginning to." Sam thought a minute and seemed to come to a
decision before speaking again. </p>
<p>"I'm going to tell you something, something I haven't even admitted to Brooke
but it stays between the two of us, understand?" she asked rigorously. Mike
nodded and outside the door, Brooke shifted so that she could hear better. </p>
<p>"I never told her this because I don't want her to get upset. She still gets
upset talking about the accident but maybe it'll help you understand. Maybe I
just need to tell someone this, I don't know. Maybe if I get it off my chest I
can finally get a good nights sleep, who knows? But Brooke once asked me what I
remembered about that night and I told her just bits and pieces. That was a lie,
Mike. You know how they say that a bad trauma will cause the brain to forget the
worst of it?" Mike nodded. "Yeah, well, I musta taken a particuarly hard bump to
that section of my grey matter because I remember everything. Crystal." </p>
<p>"I can tell you how cold that asphalt was on my back, Mike. I already
couldn't feel much below my waist. But there were three rocks digging into my
back as I lay there bleeding in Brooke's arms. My head hurt like a son of a
bitch and I felt like I was drowning, I couldn't breathe. I was cold, scared,
hurt and I was sure I was about to die. And then she was there, Mike. My own
beautiful golden angel, Brooke, holding me and keeping me safe. Once I knew she
was OK I could let go. I never thought she'd feel the same for me as I did for
her but the fact that she was right there for me as I lay dying made me feel
less afraid. And my pain faded when she smiled at me." She was crying as she
spoke, her voice cracking in places and Mike was a wreck as Sam relived that
awful night in front of him. She was letting down her walls for him to see and
he was honored to witness her this vulnerable. </p>
<p>"I was content to die right there, Mike, because I had done what I set out to
do and she was alive, breathing and safe. I thought I saw my Dad on that street,
calling out for me to join him. I heard him and then I heard Brooke speaking to
me in that beautiful voice of hers and as much as I missed my Dad, I had to
listen to Brooke. She sounded so sad. I had to hold on if only for her. I opened
my eyes and saw her and everything else faded away and my entire world consisted
of only her." </p>
<p>"Jesus, Sammy," Brooke sobbed quietly outside the room although no one heard
her. </p>
<p>"When they put me in that ambulance, I tried so hard to hold on to her
because I knew I was losing the fight. I knew I was either going to die or at
least slip into unconsciousness and I wanted the last thing I saw, my last
thought not to be of my pain or the accident, but to be of Brooke. And do you
know what the last thing I saw was?" Mike shook his head as he wiped away some
of his tears. Sam smiled. </p>
<p>"I saw her smile at me. That warm `everything will be all right' smile that
just lights up her face and warms you from within. And I believed her, Mike. And
I came home from my coma to that, never expecting things to work out the way
they did. Never dreaming that they would, but they did. And you know what? I
wouldn't trade any of it. Not a rock, a stitch, a twinge when the weather turns,
a scar, a nightmare, or any of it. No regrets, nothing. It was all worth it."
</p>
<p>It was several minutes before Mike could form a response to Sam's confession.
He sat there crying for a while and Sam just waited knowing that at last he was
coming to terms with the truth whether he liked it or not. </p>
<p>"And you never told her this?" he finally managed to ask, his voice raspy
from tears. He remembered that night all too well when the doctor outlined Sam's
injuries. Knowing that the girl remembered and lived with every ache and pain
and had never said a word was emotionally traumatizing to him and also made him
look at her in a new light. There was a strength to Sam that Mike would never
understand or could ever hope to emulate. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"I don't want to hurt her. She feels enough pain over the whole thing for
both of us as it is. Do you think we'll ever both get over it, Mike?" Sam asked,
sounding very much like a lost child. Mike shrugged. </p>
<p>"I can't say, Sam. I'd like to hope so. Scars fade and eventually so do
memories." Sam nodded, satisfied with the answer. </p>
<p>"So, are we better?" she asked, using her hand to indicate herself and him.
Mike gave her a small smile. </p>
<p>"I can't wave a magic wand and suddenly be OK with this whole thing, Sam, I
don't work that way. But you and Brooke were right in the first place, we should
have sat down and talked this out. I was wrong to have acted the way I did.
Maybe with time I can learn to accept it." </p>
<p>"Time is something we have lots of," Sam told him happily. </p>
<p>"And I never would have hit you," Mike looked away ashamed. Sam reached out
and put her hand over his. </p>
<p>"I know, heat of the moment. I shouldn't have slapped you either. Draw?" </p>
<p>"Draw," Mike agreed, glad to be let off the hook by Sam but still feeling
guilty. "Have I ever told you what an amazing individual you are?" Sam gave him
a lopsided smile. </p>
<p>"Not for a very long time," she said honestly. </p>
<p>"Well you are. Most people would have hated me for my reaction to you and
Brooke, the way I acted, the fact that I tried to hit you." </p>
<p>"Mike, if I can forgive Nic for running me over, I can forgive anyone." </p>
<p>"Still, Sam, thank you." </p>
<p>"It's a start." </p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Section 7: Dad - One Last Nightmare">
<p>"Why didn't you ever tell me you remembered everything about that night?"
Brooke demanded quietly as she entered the kitchen after her father left. Sam
choked on her Pepsi and turned an unsightly shade of red as she tried to get the
carbonation out of her lungs. </p>
<p>"Jesus," she gasped, "will you people please stop ambushing me with things
like that when I have food in my mouth? One of these times I'm gonna choke to
death," she complained. "Then where would you be without my unique brand of
sparkling company?" Brooke walked closer, a dangerous and hurt look in her eyes.
Sam looked away, unable to keep her gaze. </p>
<p>"Why didn't you tell me?" she repeated, almost in Sam's face now. Sam
shrugged wordlessly. "I heard you talking to Dad so I know the whole thing." Sam
brought her head up to meet Brooke's and was saddened by the tears she saw
there. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry," she mumbled. Brooke cupped both sides of Sam's face. </p>
<p>"You could have told me, Sammy. That's a lot of baggage to carry all by
yourself," she whispered. Tears ran down Sam's face as she looked away again.
She shrugged, unable to answer Brooke for a minute. </p>
<p>"I got it," she responded lamely as she sniffled. Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"Who takes care of Sammy?" Brooke asked, paraphrasing her father's earlier
question. Sam met her eyes for a second and then looked away again. </p>
<p>"You do," Sam whispered. </p>
<p>"All this time and you didn't tell me you remembered all that," Brooke
pointed out softly as she wiped away Sam's tears with her thumbs. </p>
<p>"Didn't want to upset you. Besides, I got it," she repeated a little
stronger. Brooke sighed again. (Damn the girl and her stubborn streak) Brooke
knew what this was. It was one more Sam McPherson wall built to protect the girl
from letting anyone too close to her emotions and while Brooke herself was
inside those walls as opposed to outside now, this was the one wall she didn't
even know existed. But she knew if they were going to move on, she was going to
have to get through it. (Just gotta push a little harder) </p>
<p>"So much pain." Brooke started only to have Sam pull away like she'd been
burned. She looked at Brooke, her eyes begging just as much as her voice. </p>
<p>"Brooke, please," her voice cracked. "Don't." Brooke pulled Sam back to her.
She wasn't letting her escape this. </p>
<p>"Let me in Sam," Brooke asked. Sam shook her head vehemently. </p>
<p>"Please don't. I can't. I've got this. I'm OK," she rambled desperately
although her eyes told Brooke differently. They told Brooke how lost, lonely and
hurt Sam really was and it broke Brooke's heart. Not that Sam wouldn't share but
that Sam had been carrying this burden for so long and that she had never
noticed. </p>
<p>"Sam, you've been walking around with this for months, joking about it and
laughing it away. You hold me when I cry about it, you soothe my fears when the
nightmares wake me screaming and tell me to let it go but what about you? Who
takes care of Sammy?" she again repeated. Sam tried to shake her head but Brooke
held it firmly in place. </p>
<p>"Brooke, don't...please," Brooke could see Sam's resolve fracturing as the
tears began to fall faster. She was starting to shake in Brooke's arms and her
breath was coming in jagged gasps. </p>
<p>"Let it go, Sam," Brooke whispered. Sam shook her head, succeeding this time
and tried to blink away the tears, unsuccessfully. </p>
<p>"If I do, I might never stop," she whispered back desperately. Brooke leaned
in closer and kissed her lightly. </p>
<p>"That's OK, I'll be here. I'll take care of you, Sammy. I promise." That was
all Sam needed as she leaned into Brooke's arms and began to cry in earnest.
"That's it, Sammy, let it all go. I'll be right here." Sam collapsed to her
knees as sobs, pent up since the accident, racked her small body and Brooke
cradled her long after the girl had fallen into an exhausted fitful sleep on the
kitchen floor. </p>
<p>"Maybe now the nightmares are finally over," Brooke whispered to the
slumbering form as she pressed a kiss to Sam's temple and drifted of to sleep as
well. </p>
