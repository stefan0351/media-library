<!-- Moment by Moment \ 10. Epilogue -->

<p>Speaking of paybacks. You wanna know what happened to Nicole after that whole
newspaper thing?</p>
<p>Moved to New York last I heard.</p>
<p>I mean, she was GONE the next day when we got to school. Not a word to
anyone, not even Mary Cherry who, I gotta tell you, is like a baby duck
following Lily around now. Between her and Josh, Lily looks pretty damn silly.</p>
<p>And that's a threesome visual I DON'T need.</p>
<p>So Sam's school life is calming down; I'm `out' and damn proud, letting
everyone know Sam is with me and that I will NEVER hurt her.</p>
<p>Nicole is gone; no one misses her, needs her or wants her. </p>
<p>Life is good.</p>
<p>Hasta la vista, baby.</p>
<p>Ding dong the witch is dead.</p>
<p>Free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty, we are.</p>
<p>"Brooke, what are you doing?" Sam's voice floats over to me and breaks my
train of thought. I lean back on the bed.</p>
<p>"Uhm...thinking?" I respond shakily. Of course, if her warm, long fingers
weren't currently crawling up the insides of my thighs, I might have been able
to form a more articulate response.</p>
<p>"Well, stop that," she purrs seductively. "I believe I owe you something.?"
She licks her lips and I whimper.</p>
<p>I don't know why I didn't see THAT coming. </p>
<p>::evil grin::</p>
<p>You can just leave my head now. Sammy and I need private time.</p>
<p>Bye!</p>
