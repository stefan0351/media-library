<!-- No Regrets \ Tunnel Vision -->

<p>Being ultra careful not to get any soap into Sam's now open
eyes, Brooke gently massaged the shampoo into the unresponsive girl's
scalp as her head hung over the sink. Brooke had permission to wash
Sam's hair and had been trained on how to do it. She mourned the
loss of Sam's long dark locks, lost to brain surgery after the
accident. It was growing back quickly but Brooke loved Sam's long
hair and couldn't wait for it to once again look as it once did.</p>
<p>"Maybe I'm just eager for things to be like they were," she
theorized out loud as she dutifully washed Sam's shorter hair. "Like,
on some level if you LOOK like you did before the accident, it'll
mean the accident didn't happen." She sighed at Sam's lack of
response. Then she chuckled to herself.</p>
<p>"OK, you need to come back soon, Sammy, because I've resorted
to psychoanalyzing myself and that can NOT be a good thing."</p>
<p>She rinsed the soap from Sam's hair, conditioned it and then
towel dried it as she finished. She liked taking care of Sam like
this but she'd just as rather be doing it to a conscious, responsive
and appreciative Sam. She wrapped Sam's head in the towel and moved
her back onto the bed before cleaning up the water basin and turning
back to Sam. For half a second, Brooke could have sworn that Sam was
watching her but on closer inspection, she saw the same blank look on
Sam's face that had been there for nearly two weeks.</p>
<p>"OK, Sammy, let's sit you up and brush out your hair," she
said simply. She lovingly brushed out Sam's hair and let it dry.
She then sat on the bed next to Sam and pulled the quiet brunette
into her arms as she lay back. Sam was all but disconnected from her
monitors and such, and Dr. Stevens had encouraged Brooke to touch
Sam, that perhaps it would speed her in regaining consciousness and
awareness.</p>
<p>"All squeaky clean, Sammy," Brooke hummed softly into Sam's
nearby ear. She held Sam close and stroked the other girl's
shoulders and arms, also a direction from Dr. Stevens to get blood
flowing to Sam's muscles. She then reached for a book from the night-stand.</p>
<p>"So, where were we, Sammy?" She opened the book to where the
bookmark lay and started reading again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"<i>Chapter Eleven: Quidditch. As they entered
November, the weather turned very cold.</i>" Brooke began reading, her
voice low and soothing. She had begun reading books to Sam as a way
to keep her voice present as Sam healed even when she'd run out of
things to say. She'd read some other books to Sam before finding the
well-worn copies of the Harry Potter series hidden in Sam's
bookcase. Brooke never knew Sam was a Potter fan and thought that if
she was going to read to her, she should at least read something she
knew that Sam liked.</p>
<p><i>"The mountains around the school became icy gray and
the lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in
frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrosting
broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long moleskin
overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots."</i></p>
<p>Brooke felt Sam suddenly snuggle closer, the first real
voluntary movement the injured girl had made.</p>
<p>"Sammy?" she asked hopefully. She heard Sam sigh and saw
that the brunette's eyes were closed.</p>
<p>"Sammy, open your eyes for me. I miss your beautiful eyes so
much," she begged. To her complete surprise, Sam's eyes fluttered
open.</p>
<p>"Oh God, can you hear me?" Brooke asked, her breath catching
in her throat. Sam whimpered in response and buried her face in
Brooke's neck. Brooke then felt Sam start to shake.</p>
<p>"You can hear me, I know you can," Brooke whispered into
Sam's hair. Sam nodded against her and Brooke felt herself start to
cry. Absolute joy flooded Brooke's body as she realized Sam was
awake and responding to her. She had her Sammy back!</p>
<p>"Can you talk? How long have you been aware of me?"</p>
<p>"Huuurtssss?" Sam shuddered. "I dunno?dark?" Brooke pulled
away slightly to look at the trembling form in her arms.</p>
<p>"What hurts, baby? What's dark?" Panic was beginning to
overwhelm joy and relief.</p>
<p>"Ev'rythin'," Sam whimpered. "Ev'rythin' hurts, s'dark?"
Brooke looked into Sam's wide-open eyes and felt her world spin out
from beneath her as the realization of Sam's condition slammed into
her. The reason behind the blank stare, the listless gaze suddenly
became all too obvious.</p>
<p>"Oh shit, Sam?you can't see?you're blind?"</p>
<p align="center">**</p>
<p>"As far as we can tell," Dr. Stevens ran a tired hand through
his hair. He was frustrated with the test results and honestly felt
that poor Sam had been through more than her fair share of turmoil
and pain. "The blood clot that was removed apparently put pressure on
her optic nerve before we were able to get to it, causing damage to
her eyesight. Now whether or not this is permanent?I'm afraid we'll
have to wait and see."</p>
<p>"At least she's awake and responding," Mike chirped trying to
put a positive spin on the situation. Jane sent him a caustic look.</p>
<p>"She's blind, Mike. No thanks to you," she snapped and then
turned to her daughters, huddled together on the bed. The fact that
Sam would only let Brooke and medical staff near her struck her as
odd but for now she was willing not to think about it.</p>
<p>Mike sighed. He was watching his marriage hit the toilet
faster than a Mexi-melt from Taco Bell.</p>
<p>"Wait and see," Jane mumbled. "How about I get a Voodoo
doctor and see if THAT helps?"</p>
<p>"Mom?" Brooke sighed, a hint of warning in her voice. She
didn't want the negative vibes she could feel in the room reaching
Sammy.</p>
<p>"Brooke, she's blind and the doctors have no idea how to
help. I'm a little frustrated, aren't you?" Jane asked impatiently.
Brooke nodded. "Well, then, why don't you do something to help
instead of just sitting there?"</p>
<p>"Jane, leave Brooke alone," Mike broke in. "She's the only
one who was able to reach Sam in the first place and you're letting
your jealousy towards that color your behavior now." </p>
<p>"Michael?" Jane growled. "My daughter is blinded?HANDICAPPED
because YOU didn't stop an obviously drunk teen from getting behind
the wheel of a car and mowing her down. Now I have to readjust
everything to accommodate this new wrinkle. Now I'll have to take
care of baby Mac and blind Sam."</p>
<p>"Oh get over yourself, Jane!" Mike huffed. "What's happened
to you? Since the accident you've become an unbearable harpy. This
isn't about YOU. Sam is the one affected by all this. SHE'S the one
who can't see."</p>
<p>"Uh guys," Sam's weak voice cut through the tension
sharply. "I'm not in a coma anymore. I'm blind, not deaf. I can hear you."</p>
<p>"And I think it's better for her if you leave," Brooke
instructed angrily. Mike, knowing that his daughter was right, nodded. Jane just shot her a dirty look.</p>
<p>"I can stay if I please, Brooke. She's MY daughter." </p>
<p>"Actually," Dr. Stevens cleared his throat. "I think it WOULD
be better for Sam if you were to step out for a while until you can
get a handle on your temper, Mrs. McPherson. Trust me, your
theatrics aren't doing anyone any<span lang="en-us"> </span>good."</p>
<p>"Excuse me?" Jane gasped incredulously as Mike snickered. </p>
<p>"Here, let me direct you to our Counselor downstairs who
deals in these sort of situations," Dr. Stevens said as he ushered
both parents out and sent a look at Brooke who mouthed `thank you' at
him.</p>
<p>"God, Brooke?has it been like that since?" Sam trailed off as
Brooke held her a little tighter. She only felt safe when Brooke was
holding her. The all-encompassing darkness scared her so bad that
she just wanted to curl up into a ball and go back to sleep. But
Brooke's warm presence wouldn't let her do that. She heard Brooke
sigh heavily.</p>
<p>"I wasn't home a lot. I was here mostly. But yeah, it has
been like that a lot, I guess," Brooke answered. Sam felt hot tears
burn her eyes and race down her face.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry?I ruined everything," she sobbed. She felt Brooke
wrap herself around her and gentle fingers wipe away her tears.</p>
<p>"God, no, Sam. This isn't your fault. Not at all. It's
Nicole's," Brooke soothed. Sam could hear Brooke, feel and smell
her. She just really wanted to see her.</p>
<p>"I wish Nicole'd killed me," she wailed into Brooke's arms.
Brooke felt her heart shatter with despair and fear.</p>
<p>"No, Sammy?God, no. You saved my life. I'd die without you
in it."</p>
<p>Sam listened to the words but, not being able to see Brooke's
face, she wasn't sure if she was hearing Brooke correctly. Yes, she
remembered, vividly, the night they'd spent together before the
prom. It was one of, if not THE happiest memory she had. But, if
she understood the tone and timber of Brooke's voice correctly, there
was much more to Brooke's feelings than she'd initially realized.</p>
<p>"What?" she sniffled. "What do you mean? Why am I so
important?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Sammy," Brooke said lovingly, and Sam couldn't mistake
the love that obviously colored the way Brooke said her nickname. "I
thought you understood. You're so important to me because I love
you."</p>
<p>"I'm IN love with you, Sammy."</p>
