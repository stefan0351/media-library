<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Chapter Two -->

<p>Brooke was beyond worried. Sam hadn?t come home the night before and the imaginative blonde?s mind was working overtime coming up with reasons why.</p>
<p>&lt;She?s been in an accident. She?s hurt. She?s been kidnapped. She ran away&gt; she fretted. Her stomach turned as she realized the possible real reason why Sam was late.</p>
<p>&lt;She was having SUCH a good time she decided to stay&gt; The very thought of Nicole touching her Sam made Brooke?s skin crawl. She wanted to kill the shorter blonde for her betrayal.</p>
<p>&lt;Damn her! She knew how I felt and took advantage of it. If she hurts Sammy through this I?ll?&gt; her thoughts were broken by the sound of the front door closing and footsteps coming up the stairs. Brooke practically ran to her door to see Sam at the top of the stairs looking tired and yet oddly pleased with herself. Her stomach lurched again as she noticed the glazed and satisfied look in Sam?s eyes.</p>
<p>"Hiya Brooke," Sam greeted her sleepily. Brooke sighed and tried to banish both her anger at Nicole and the X-rated images now running through her mind involving what Sam had done that night.</p>
<p>"Sam," she said back. "You?re home late, or should I say early?" Sam arched an eyebrow and shrugged.</p>
<p>"I fell asleep at Nicole?s. I was tired," a wide grin spread across the brunette?s face and Brooke nearly tossed her cookies on the girls? Doc Marten?s.</p>
<p>"Ew, Sam, please," she complained. "Spare me the imagery." Sam turned to face her fully.</p>
<p>"God, what is your problem Brooke? It?s my life," she pointed out.</p>
<p>"You slept with Nicole! She?s the town?s freaking bicycle, Sam, EVERYONE?S had a ride," Brooke retorted, her earlier anger returning and directed at the wrong source. "You can do better." Sam?s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>"You know, if I didn?t know any better, I?d swear you were jealous," she snapped. "But since we both know you?re ?better? than that, I don?t. Yes, I slept with Nicole, and you know what? It was GREAT! Super-freaking-mind-blowing-fantastic! You know what else? Not just once either! Again and again and again," she taunted Brooke. Brooke closed her eyes against the onslaught of tears. She really didn?t want to hear about it.</p>
<p>"Sam, please," she begged.</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact, I haven?t even BEEN to sleep yet. So if you?ll excuse me, I?m exhausted," Sam slammed her bedroom door behind her, leaving Brooke weeping in the hallway.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Nicole smirked evilly at Brooke during school Monday morning. From the look on the taller girl's face, Nicole was sure that Brooke knew what Sam had been up to over the weekend.</p>
<p>&lt;Ultimately, I win, Brookie&gt; she snickered to herself. &lt;I got the first shot at your precious Sammy. And WHOO, damn that girl is talented&gt; Despite herself, Nicole felt herself flush at the mere thought of her 'date' with Sam Friday night and Saturday morning. She had definitely gotten in a little further over her head then she'd intended. But never one to be beaten, Nicole figured she'd figure out what was going on and how to handle it later. After all, she was the Queen Bitch. It wouldn't do for this thing with Sam to evolve into more than what she intended it to be.</p>
<p>"Hey you," Sam purred in Nicole's ear from behind, making the shorter girl shudder involuntarily. She tried to force that pesky feeling away as Sam's warm arms wrapped around her waist.</p>
<p>"Hey," she said back nonchalantly. Sam sighed.</p>
<p>"Ah, 'Cold Mode Nicole', I get it," Sam said unwrapping her arms and moving to stand in front of Nicole. She knew the game and as much as she hated it, played along. Nicole managed to successfully hide her disappointment at the loss of contact with Sam.</p>
<p>&lt;I am NOT thinking that way. I am SO not thinking that way&gt; she repeated. &lt;She is an end to justify my means. Nothing more&gt; She looked up into the smirking chocolate eyes and felt a flutter in her stomach.</p>
<p>&lt;Damn those eyes. They make me melt and I'm supposed to be beyond that. I think I'm beginning to see what Brooke sees in her, damn it. This could be trouble&gt;</p>
<p>"Plans for tonight?" Sam asked. Nicole cleared her throat and shrugged.</p>
<p>"I've got Glamazon practice but after that, I'm all yours," she said with a small smile. They both jumped and turned at the sound of a locker slamming shut and watched as Brooke stalked away from them.</p>
<p>"God, what is her problem?" Sam asked sounding vaguely hurt. Nicole hid her triumphant smile.</p>
<p>&lt;Heh heh, I know what it is, Sammy. Jealousy is a WONDERFUL thing. I'll beat that blonde bimbo yet&gt; Nic laughed to herself.</p>
<p>"Probably sexual frustration. She never should have broken it off with Josh. Don't worry about it, Sam. As soon as she figures out the whole 'manual' thing, she'll be fine."</p>
<p>"NIC!" Sam blushed. Nicole pretended to ignore her.</p>
<p>"Or we could buy her a 'gift'. In the interest of her health, of course," she went on. "There's a shop downtown that specializes in..."</p>
<p>"OVERSHARE," Sam interrupted her, still blushing bright red. Nicole thought it was cute. And then scolded herself for the thought.</p>
<p>"Well, whatever it is, I'm sure she'll get over it," Nicole tossed out with a shrug.</p>
<p>&lt;Or not. At any rate, I really could care less&gt; she thought evilly. She wanted to break Brooke anyway that she could and if that meant driving the girl into the ground emotionally, so be it. Whatever it took for Nicole to teach her that SHE was Queen and not Brooke, Nic was willing to do. And God help whoever got in her way. Even Sam.</p>
<p>"So," Sam drawled, breaking Nicole from her plotting. "After practice you're all mine, huh?" Again the tone of Sam's voice made Nicole force down an involuntary shudder. She really wished Sam would stop doing that to her. It didn't bode well for her future plans.</p>
<p>"You bet," she answered. Sam leaned over and brushed her lips against Nicole's. There was no need to hide their relationship, Mary Cherry had alerted the entire school to it. And since no one had the guts to confront or challenge Nicole Julian about it, they were left alone. Nicole sighed as Sam moved and nipped her earlobe.</p>
<p>"I like the sound of that," Sam whispered before releasing the soft flesh and pulling away. "Later Nicole." She left the petite blonde quaking in the hallway.</p>
<p>&lt;Oh damn. I think I'm in trouble&gt;</p>
