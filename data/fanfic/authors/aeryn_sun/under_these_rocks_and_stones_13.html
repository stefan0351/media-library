<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Behind the 8 Ball -->

<p>Sam shifted uncomfortably on the bed. Her shoulder was killing
her and she was out of medication. Not that it mattered. The physical pain she
was in paled in comparison to the emotional pain she felt. Her own mother had
all but disowned her upon hearing the truth that she was gay and in love with
Brooke. And now here she was, staying in a hotel suite because Mike had kicked
them out of the Palace and onto the street. She looked at Brooke's sleeping form
and envied her. (At least one of us can sleep) she thought with a sigh. Between
the lingering pain from her injuries from the car accident and the constant
replaying of her mother and Mike's reactions to her and Brooke, Sam hadn't slept
much in three days. </p>
<p>It was strange that the accident was what prompted Brooke to
want to tell their parents but Sam didn't want to argue with her. Her
relationship with her mother had always been an open and honest one. That's why
keeping the secret for as long as she did was as hard and painful as it was.
She'd felt like a liar, a fraud for too long. She thought her mother, while
shocked at first, would be OK with it. Jane had never given any indication of
being homophobic. Sam was more worried about Mike's reaction. But her mother had
reacted just as badly as Mike and did nothing to stop Mike from throwing her and
Brooke out of the house. And that upset Sam. </p>
<p>She sighed again and tried to find a comfortable position but
it eluded her. </p>
<p>"Can't sleep, Sammy?" Brooke's gentle voice floated to her
ears as the blonde rolled over. </p>
<p>"I didn't mean to wake you," Sam apologized. Brooke wrapped
her arms around Sam as best she could and cuddled closer. </p>
<p>"S'OK," Brooke mumbled burying her face in Sam's shoulder.
"It'll work out. You'll see." Sam couldn't help but smile at Brooke's optimism
even if she didn't share in it. She had a sneaking suspicion things were going
to get worse before they got better. She kissed the top of Brooke's head.
</p>
<p>"I hope so, Love. For all our sakes." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam sat flipping through the channels as Brooke took a shower.
(What the Heck?) Sam thought as she went back a few channels. Her eyebrows shot
to the top of her forehead. (Gee, Nic spared no expense. The Spice Channel) she
thought wryly. She tilted her head and wondered if THAT was even possible.
Blushing, she cleared her throat and changed the channel. (Disney, yeah that's
better. Hurry up with that shower Brooke!) </p>
<p>The knock at the door made her jump guiltily. (Oh, get a grip,
Sam. You weren't doing anything wrong) she reminded herself. Of course, opening
the door to see her mother standing there only made her blush deepen.
</p>
<p>"Mom?" she said surprised. Jane sighed as she looked at her
daughter. </p>
<p>"Samantha," she greeted her. (Uh-oh, Mom only calls me
`Samantha' when I'm in trouble) Sam automatically went on the defensive.
</p>
<p>"What do you want, Mom?" she asked curtly. Jane still hadn't
entered the room. </p>
<p>"The Honeymoon Suite?" Jane asked sarcastically. Sam rolled
her eyes. </p>
<p>"Nic got us the room, Mom. Now what do you want? You're
obviously not here to ask us to come home so why are you darkening my doorstep?"
She hated arguing with her mother but she wasn't going to let her hurt her
anymore than she already had. </p>
<p>"Nicole? I wondered how you were paying for this," Jane
commented. "I'm here because I do want to work this out, Sam," she explained,
her voice losing its contemptuous edge. Sam eyed her mother suspiciously.
</p>
<p>"How do you intend to do that when you won't even listen?" Sam
asked impatiently. "Nothing is going to change no matter what you say."
</p>
<p>"I want to understand, Sam," Jane said plainly. "And I think
the only way I can do that is if we were to go to therapy together." Sam let out
a short laugh. </p>
<p>"I don't believe it, Nic called it," she scoffed leaving her
mother confused. She turned back to her mother. "Therapy? You think talking to a
shrink can `fix' this?" </p>
<p>"Sam, I think it'd be a good idea for all of us," Jane told
her. </p>
<p>"I'm not broken, Mom. No amount of talking is going to
rearrange my sexual preference." </p>
<p>"Sam," Jane said plaintively. "Please at least think about it.
I'm trying to understand." </p>
<p>"What about Mike?" </p>
<p>"He wants Brooke to go to therapy too. This is to be a group
effort," Jane explained. Sam laughed again. </p>
<p>"Oh for God's sake!" she uttered in disbelief. "That's really
pathetic, you know it? You two can't talk to us yourselves so you're going to
pay someone else 200 dollars an hour to do it for you. That's really sad." Jane
threw her hands in the air in frustation. </p>
<p>"Sam, damn it, we're trying. We're reaching out to you. Why
are you making this harder?" Sam glared at her mother. </p>
<p>"Can we come home?" she asked, her voice low and dangerous.
Jane blinked at her for a moment before shaking her head reluctantly.
</p>
<p>"No," she said simply. Sam's glare grew hotter. </p>
<p>"Than that's why I'm making this hard," she growled in a
barely recognizable voice. "You two want to talk to us, but on YOUR terms. With
a mediator and we can't even come home. You don't want to understand, you want
to `fix' us," Sam accused angrily. </p>
<p>"Sam, you're twisting this," Jane started. </p>
<p>"Am I?" Sam countered. "Am I really? Tell me, Mom, ultimately,
what do you want out of the therapy? Do you really want to understand what
motivates me to love Brooke and why I'm gay or do you want me to change?" Jane
had no answer for her. </p>
<p>"Yeah, that's what I thought," Sam snapped. Jane handed her a
small business card. </p>
<p>"Here's the name of the therapist and the time of the
appointment, Sam. Mike and I will be there. We hope you and Brooke will show up
too," she said sadly before turning to leave. </p>
<p>"Mom, when did we fall apart?" Sam asked suddenly. Jane turned
back around to face her and shrugged. </p>
<p>"I don't know, Sam. But then, I don't know you anymore
either," she said. And then she left. Sam shut the door and then slid down to
the floor against it. Brooke came out of the bathroom and sat down next to her. </p>
<p>"Aw, Sammy," she said as she hugged Sam gently. Sam sobbed
against her as the exchange with her mother finally got to her. </p>
<p>"You overheard?" Sam asked between sobs. Brooke nodded.
</p>
<p>"Everything. And that last shot was uncalled for," she
commented angrily. She was mad at Jane for saying such a thing. </p>
<p>"So what do you think, Brooke? Think we should go?" Sam
sniffled. Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"I dunno, Sam. I think it's gonna be an ambush," she admitted.
Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Me too," Sam agreed. </p>
<p>"But, I suppose we should at least give it one try."
</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The therapist's office was in a small clinic and both girls
entered the building warily. Both had a bad feeling about the whole thing. It
was like walking into the lion's den with a raw steak around their neck, just
asking for trouble. But neither could refuse their parents on the off chance
that this was a sincere attempt. As they reached room 203 Sam hedged.
</p>
<p>"I've got a really bad feeling about this," she repeated for
the sixth time that Brooke could recall. Brooke couldn't help rolling her eyes. </p>
<p>"I know you do. So do I but they are our parents. We owe them
at least one chance," she said patiently. Sam arched an eyebrow in challenge. </p>
<p>"They treated us like circus freaks and tossed us out on our
asses and you still think we owe them something? You are a far more forgiving
person than I am, love," she commented while shaking her head. Brooke smiled. </p>
<p>"That's why you love me," she joked. Sam returned the smile. </p>
<p>"That's one reason. The killer body doesn't hurt either," she
retorted making Brooke blush slightly. Together they opened the door and walked
to the receptionist's desk. </p>
<p>"We're here for a 3:30 appointment with a Dr. Snowe," Brooke
explained. The receptionist nodded. </p>
<p>"They're expecting you. Third door to the left," she said
pointing down the hall. Sam and Brooke shrugged at each other and walked down
the hall. Upon opening the door they were immediately faced with their parents
and a stocky middle-aged man. </p>
<p>"Hello, you must be Sam and Brooke. I'm Dr. Snowe but you can
call me Frank," the man smiled as he introduced himself. He motioned for the
girls to sit. </p>
<p>"Hello," Brooke said shaking his hand as she sat down.
</p>
<p>"Hi," Sam mumbled. </p>
<p>"Well," Frank said clapping his hands together and sitting
back down. "I've heard about you from your parents but why don't the two of you
tell me a little about yourselves?" Sam glared at the little man. </p>
<p>"What do you want to know?" she asked snottily. Frank tilted
his head slightly. </p>
<p>"Well, Sam, I know you're a writer and Brooke's a
cheerleader," he started. "What sort of things do you write?" Sam sighed.
</p>
<p>"Articles for the school newspaper," she answered boredly.
Frank nodded. </p>
<p>"And Brooke, you're the head cheerleader?" Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Yes," she answered in nearly the same tone Sam used. (Gee,
this is fun) she thought sarcastically. </p>
<p>"Look, can we just skip the `getting to know you' part of this
charade and get to why we're all here?" Sam snapped. For once, Brooke was glad
Sam's temper got the better of her. She felt the same way. </p>
<p>"Why do you think you're here, Sam?" Frank asked. Sam looked
at Brooke. </p>
<p>"See? This is why I hate shrinks. They can never answer a
direct question. They always answer a question with a question," she explained.
Brooke smiled at her. </p>
<p>"I know," she responded. She decided to play the same game.
"Gee, Frank, why don't you tell us?" She saw Sam grin devilishly at her.
</p>
<p>"Girls, stop it," Jane snapped. Both girls fixed blank stares
on their mother. </p>
<p>"Stop what, Mom?" Sam asked innocently. "We can't talk about
why we're here if no one will tell us what that reason is." </p>
<p>"You're both being childish," Mike growled. </p>
<p>"No, you two `adults' and I use that term loosely, are being
childish," Brooke countered. "We were being honest the other day and you both
totally flipped and went out of control. We were being responsible and you acted
like a pair of crazed zealots." </p>
<p>"You can't just march in and announce you're gay and in love
with your stepsister expect us to say `OK great. When's the wedding?', Brooke,"
Mike argued. </p>
<p>"I didn't ask you to do that, Dad," Brooke pointed out. "But
you didn't have to pull the `not in my house' crap and throw us out."
</p>
<p>"It was your choice to leave," Mike told her angrily.
</p>
<p>"Choice?" Sam spoke up. "What choice? Stop loving one another
or move out? Some choice. You might as well ask me to stop breathing, cuz it'd
be easier than to stop loving Brooke." </p>
<p>"I think we all need to calm down," Frank broke in. Everyone
ignored him. </p>
<p>"When did all of this come about? When did you discover you
were gay?" Jane asked both girls. They exchanged looks. </p>
<p>"I knew a long time ago that I was gay, Mom," Sam admitted. "I
fell for Brooke long ago but wasn't going to say anything because I thought she
was straight and I didn't want to upset the family." </p>
<p>"So this is your fault?" Mike accused. </p>
<p>"Oh shit," Sam mumbled as she put her head in her hands. </p>
<p>"No, Dad," Brooke interrupted before her father could get
going. "I've had feelings for Sam for a long time too, I just ignored them
because they scared me. This `all came about' because I overheard her confess
her feelings for me to someone else and I couldn't deny the way I felt anymore." </p>
<p>"Brooke, you're not gay," Mike said patiently. Brooke looked
at him like he suddenly sprouted another head. </p>
<p>"And you're basing that assumption on?" she asked. </p>
<p>"You've dated guys. Just look at Josh," he explained. Brooke
sighed. </p>
<p>"And look how well that worked out," she said sarcastically.
"Dad, I'm gay, or at least bi if it makes you feel better. Either way, my heart
and soul belong to Sam." Sam smiled at her at hearing those words. </p>
<p>"And mine are hers," Sam said more to Brooke than anyone else
in the room. </p>
<p>"Maybe you're not understanding me, Brooke. You're not gay
because I won't allow it," Mike said defiantly. Brooke stared at him in shock
for a minute and then burst out laughing. </p>
<p>"Like you have any control over it," she mocked him. Mike
glared at her. </p>
<p>"That's where you're wrong. I do. Jane and I have discussed
this and we decided that if the two of you were stubborn about this that we only
had one option left to us." Brooke's laughter abruptly stopped and a cold chill
crept up her spine. She had an awful feeling something really bad was about to
happen. </p>
<p>"What is that supposed to mean?" Sam asked lowly. She didn't
like the sound of that either. Jane looked at her daughter sadly. </p>
<p>"Since neither of you will listen to reason and threatening to
throw you out only resulted in you moving to a hotel, our only course of action
is to send one of you away," Jane explained quietly. Sam sprang out of her chair
like she was shot out of it. </p>
<p>"Like Hell!" she explained. "We're old enough to make our own
decisions!" </p>
<p>"Actually, Sam," Frank broke in, "you're both under 18 and as
such your parents still have control of you." Brooke stood up to join Sam. </p>
<p>"Neither of us is going anywhere," she declared. Jane shook
her head. </p>
<p>"Sam is going to Chicago to live with her grandparents," she
said. </p>
<p>"I am not!" Sam announced as she headed for the door. Mike
stood up and grabbed her to stop her. Sam let out a loud gasp as Mike accidently
grabbed her injured arm and she crumpled to the floor in pain. </p>
<p>"Dad!" Brooke chastized as she knelt down next to Sam who was
gasping and clutching her arm. "You OK?" she asked Sam. </p>
<p>"Yeah," Sam rasped. "Give me a sec." Brooke glared up at her
parents. </p>
<p>"Do you see what you're doing to us? Hurting us and I don't
mean just like this. Do you think we did this on purpose to hurt you? Because we
didn't. We fell in love and yes, it's awkward and inconvienent and for that
we're sorry. But sending Sam away isn't going to change anything. Separating us
isn't going to suddenly make either of us straight again. All you're going to
end up doing is losing us both." </p>
<p>"We're not asking you to suddenly change your minds and say
you're OK with this. We know it's a huge shock. But you're overreacting. You're
using a baseball bat to swat at a fruit fly. Your daughter's are gay and in
love. 2000 miles isn't going to change that. You're going to make us both resent
you for the rest of our lives if you do this." </p>
<p>"Brooke, this is wrong. You don't know what you're doing,"
Jane reasoned. Brooke sighed and shook her head. </p>
<p>"We are acutely aware of what we're doing," she said calmly as
Sam grasped her hand. Sam looked at her with love and a touch of fear in her
soft brown eyes. They stood to lose everything in the next few minutes but
Brooke wasn't going to let that happen. </p>
<p>"You're not sending her away," Brooke said with such steel in
her voice that Sam had no doubt in her mind that she wasn't going anywhere. "We
will climb in the car and drive away, never to be seen or heard from again if
that's what it takes but you are NOT taking her away from me, do you understand
that?" Brooke asked, her voice raising dangerously. </p>
<p>"I almost lost her in that stupid accident and I am never
letting go of her again. So, either find a way to accept this, turn a blind eye,
or whatever. Those are your choices, Mom, Dad. Take them or leave them."
</p>
<p>"You've got a lot of nerve," Mike snarled. Brooke glared at
him. </p>
<p>"You're right, I do. For the first time in my life I'm
standing up for what I want and not for what someone else wants for me. I'm
thinking for myself and that's what bothers you. You can't control me and it's
driving you crazy." She helped Sam to her feet. </p>
<p>"Come on, Sam, I think we're through here," she said as they
headed to the door. Sam turned to her mother who was crying. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry it has to be like this, Mom. I really am. Maybe the
therapy thing could work if you really wanted it to but if all you wanted it for
was to ambush us so you could send me away you should be ashamed," she said
sadly. Jane hung her head. </p>
<p>"I didn't intend it that way, Sam," she cried. "I really want
to work this out." </p>
<p>"Than maybe, once we all calm down, we can give it another
try. But if you pull another `We're sending you away' schtick, I'll never
forgive you," Sam pointed out. "Because it'll never work. I'll find my way back
to Brooke if I have to walk on my hands and knees to get to her." </p>
<p>"I understand," Jane said. "I'm sorry." </p>
<p>"I know you are. Come on, Brooke, let's go back to our room." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke sat watching TV with Sam sprawled across her chest
asleep. She'd finally fallen into a fitful sleep about an hour before and Brooke
was glad the brunette was finally sleeping. She knew Sam wasn't getting much
sleep but the afternoon's exchange with their parents had taken a lot out of
both of them. They'd called Lily and Nic after they'd gotten back and the other
girls were shocked at how bad things had gotten. They'd offered their support as
much as they could but both of their mothers were still on the rampage with
Nic's mom coming around again for round two with her daughter. </p>
<p>Brooke gently stroked Sam's hair as she watched the movie on
the TV and wondered how things were going to get better. There had to be a way
to rectify the situation, to make their parents calm down. They just had to find
it. Of course, the nagging fear that Mike and Jane were never going to be OK
with the whole thing was what was eating at her. She shut off the TV and settled
down with Sam. She kissed Sam's forehead and closed her eyes, hoping that sleep
would come to her soon. </p>
<p>"Maybe tomorrow things will be better, Sammy," she whispered
hopefully to the sleeping girl in her arms. At least she could hope. Right now,
hope and Sam were all she had. </p>
