<!-- Telling Series \ Section 3: Harrison - Ego Plate For 1 -->

<p>"Thanks you two, dinner was delicious," Harrison declared as he finished his
plate. Brooke and Sam smiled. </p>
<p>"You can thank Brooke. I'm lucky if I can make cereal without setting fire to
the kitchen," Sam told him making them all laugh. </p>
<p>"She's not that bad, Harrison. Just the other day she made me a wonderful
dinner," Brooke said as she cleared the table. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Macaroni and cheese out of a box, Harrison. Even I can figure that much
out." Harrison watched the two in wonder. </p>
<p>"I never figured the two of you for becoming the picture of domestic bliss.
You're almost like an old married couple," he said casually. Good thing Sam was
sitting or she would have fallen over. And good thing Brooke had a good grip on
those dishes or they would have needed to go shopping for new place settings.
They stared at him in barely disguised shock. </p>
<p>"Excuse me?" Sam asked. (Was that my voice? I sounded like Alvin the
chimpmunk after sucking on helium) Harrison looked at her like she sprouted
feathers. </p>
<p>"What? Two years ago you couldn't stand to be in the same zip code never mind
the same house and now you cook for each other, it just blows the mind, that's
all. Who knew?" he answered with a smile. "I think it's great you get along so
well." </p>
<p>(Oh, Harrison if only you knew) Brooke sighed to herself and exchanged
anxious glances with Sam. </p>
<p>"So, Harrison," Brooke started after she put the dishes down and sat at the
table, "how are things with your Mom?" She caught the look Sam sent her. It
plainly asked (What the Hell are you doing? Are you brain damaged?) She chose to
ignore it. Harrison sighed. </p>
<p>"Better. Not great, but better. It's tough, you know. I thought she was this
one person my whole life and then she turns out to be someone else. It's tough
to deal with sometimes." (Oh, great) Sam thought bitterly, (Here, let's add to
your baggage) </p>
<p>"She's still your Mom, Harrison, she still loves you," Brooke said gently.
Harrison nodded. </p>
<p>"I know, but she lied to me for so long. It's hard to get over that." Sam
shot Brooke a desperate look. Brooke shrugged at her with a pained expression on
her face. </p>
<p>"But you've forgiven her?" Sam prompted. Harrison shrugged. </p>
<p>"I don't have much choice, I guess. She's my mom," he looked up at his two
dinner companions. "Why the sudden interest in my parental situation?" </p>
<p>"Harrison, are you homophobic?" Sam asked bluntly. Brooke glared at her so
hotly it could have melted steel. Harrison's look was similar. </p>
<p>"Are you trying to piss me off, Sam? Because you're doing a good job so far,"
he growled. Sam raised her hands, palms up at Brooke to say (you try) and then
shut up. Harrison watched the exchange and turned his attention to Brooke. </p>
<p>"You want to tell me why she's acting so loopy all of a sudden? Is it an
after effect of the coma?" he asked, his voice taking on a hard edge. "I know
that head trauma can make people act funny sometimes but I thought she was
recovered." Silently Sam figured he already knew where the conversation was
going. (Yeah, Harrison, two points for Oblivious Boy) Sam laughed to herself.
Meanwhile, Brooke sighed. Sometimes she wondered how a writer as talented as Sam
could lack so much tact. It was like Sam was absent the day they taught that at
would-be-journalist school. </p>
<p>"Harrison, she's fine. Just as subtle as a brick, as usual," Sam glared at
her. "Look, we really wanted to talk to you about something tonight." </p>
<p>"And that concerns my Mom how?" a slightly suspicious tone was creeping into
his voice and Sam was positive he couldn't be THAT thick an individual. </p>
<p>"Harrison, I don't, we don't know how to say this.to tell you this." Brooke
trailed off, suddenly at a loss for words. Sam watched her falter and took pity
on the girl she loved so much so she spoke up again. </p>
<p>"All right, listen up because I'm only going over this once," she said to
draw Harrison's attention back to her. Harrison stared at her waiting patiently.
Sam felt a little bead of sweat run down the side of her face and impatiently
reached up to wipe it away. (God, I hope I don't look like I'm panicing) </p>
<p>"I love Brooke, she loves me. Not in a stepsister way, but in a gay
girlfriend/girlfriend sort of way. If you have some sort of problem with that,
and I really hope you don't because you really mean a lot to the both of us,
then take your issues elsewhere," she paused for breath and gauged Harrison's
reaction. His face was blank. Unsure what to make of this, Sam continued. </p>
<p>"I know this has got to be confusing. Hell, it was for us too, but this is
real, Harrison. And yes, Mom knows. So do Lily and Josh. They all took it really
well and just want us to be happy. I know that you have, had feelings for one or
both of us at some time, Harrison but it was never going to work out. Our hearts
belong to each other. It's the simple truth. We just ask that you either accept
or not, but either way, respect our privacy and not go blabbing it all over
school like some sort of demented town crier. Let us tell everyone our own way.
Give us that much," finished and out of breath, Sam stopped and waited for
Harrison's reaction. </p>
<p>Brooke waited too, relieved that Sam had said all that and it was at last out
of the way. Harrison looked from one girl to the next, back and forth for
several minutes without saying a word. This was making them very, very nervous. </p>
<p>"You're kidding, right?" he asked quietly, looking down at the table for a
second. "I'll forgive you if you are, this once." A few tears slipped down
Brooke's face as she shook her head and Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"'Fraid not, Harrison,' Sam informed him. (Here it comes, I can hear the
pressure building) Harrison's face turned purple and he sprung up from his chair
so fast it reminded Sam of those movie theatres that used to have the shocking
seats. He now looked at both girls like they'd grown horns and tails. </p>
<p>"Holy Shit! Is it something in the God Damn water supply?" His arms started
to flap like he was trying to fly away and Brooke had to surpress the hysterical
giggle that bubbled up unexpectedly. </p>
<p>"First my Mom goes all gay on me and now my two best friends? The two girls I
love the most? One who I slept with and the one who I dreamed of marrying
someday?" Sam and Brooke looked at each other guiltily. They'd been expecting
this but it didn't make it hurt any less. </p>
<p>"Did I do something to cause this? Am I really that bad? Is is me that make
all the women in my life become lesbians? Because it sure feels that way," he
ranted pitifully. </p>
<p>"Harrison, you know that's ridiculous," Sam started. Harrison cut her off
with a begging look. He reminded her of a puppy who was just kicked in the ribs
with a steel toed cowboy boot. </p>
<p>"Is it Sam? I dreamed of having children with you someday, Sam," he
confessed, tears appearing on his face and mirrored on hers. That comment
actually hurt. "It's one of the things that kept me going when I was sick. That
and keeping you from marrying the wrong guy! And now I see I shouldn't have been
worrying about a GUY!" he shot Brooke a dirty look that then softened. </p>
<p>"And Brooke, God, Brooke, I have loved you in some way since kindergarden.
How could you do this to me?" Sam moved towards him but he backed away like she
was a leper. </p>
<p>"Stay the Hell away from me, haven't you hurt me enough? I bet the two of you
were having one Hell of a good laugh at my expense, huh?" he continued angrily.
"All this time I spent pining for the both of you while you were groping each
other behind my back. `Poor little Harrison, look at how he longs for you
Brooke, and I've got you all to myself'. Or `Harrison will never know you the
way I do, Sam'. It's sick!" he was screaming now and both girls were reduced to
tears although Sam was beginning to get pissed. </p>
<p>"Back off, Harrison, it's not like that. You have no idea what you're talking
about," she shot back, lashing out with her own hurt and desperate to regain
control of the situation before it degraded any further. </p>
<p>"Then tell me Sam, how long have you been fucking Brooke? Did it start before
or after the accident? Is that it why you saved her? Or is this your doing
Brooke? Were you taking advantage of Sam while she was weak and confused? Are
you just playing with her until the next football star comes along to satisfy
you? Tell me, Brooke, is Sammy a good fuck?" The resounding slap Harrison got
from Brooke that echoed through the kitchen for a long time served to stop any
further conversation. </p>
<p>"I think you'd better leave now, Harrison," Brooke hissed in a low growl, no
longer crying and angry beyond words. Her entire body was trembling with the
unspent emotion. "You are no longer welcome in our home until you can behave
with some level of civility and maturity." </p>
<p>Harrison raised his hand and put in on the cheek Brooke had hit and stared at
the girls in shock. He took a minute to recover from being struck and then shook
his head in disgust and disappointment. </p>
<p>"Whatever," he mumbled. "You're both a pair of messed up head cases." He
grabbed his coat and hastily headed for the door. He turned back to Sam, malice
lighting his eyes. "Hey Sam, I'd go back and get my head examined if I were you.
That accident obviously did more damage than you thought it did. And Brooke," he
turned his glower to the blonde, "I don't remember what I ever saw in you.
You're as shallow and vapid as Sam always said you were." </p>
<p>"Get out, Harrison," Sam ordered in a low growl. Brooke wrapped her arms
around Sam from behind, holding on tight both for support and to keep the highly
irate brunette from doing bodily harm to Harrison. Something in Sam's tone told
Brooke it wasn't far off from happening. Harrison glared at them both evilly. </p>
<p>"You make me sick. And don't worry about me telling anyone. This is the last
thing I'll ever want to discuss again. You two no longer exist to me," he spat
and slammed the door behind him. </p>
