<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Spin Out -->

<p>"Come on, Mac, shake that little booty!" Sam encouraged as
her little sister bounced along to the music blaring through the
house.  Clutching her 'Blues Clues' puppy tightly in one hand, Mac
giggled as she bobbed up and down with the beat.  Well, almost with
the beat.  Sam laughed and figured that it was better than most of
the people she saw her own age out dancing lately.</p>
<p>Brooke walked into the living room to find Sam holding onto
Mac's freehand while the still somewhat wobbly toddler swayed with
the music.  Mac dropped her toy, screeched with laughter and tried
even harder to keep up with Sam.  It was the funniest, and cutest
thing Brooke had ever seen.</p>
<p>She ran to get the camcorder and came back to find Jane and
Terri watching them from the doorway, barely suppressing their own
merriment.  She videotaped Sam and Mac dancing in the living room,
complete with Sam swinging a hysterically laughing Mac through the
air.  </p>
<p>It was rare to see Sam so at ease and unguarded, especially around
the baby.  She still had the irrational fear of 'breaking' the
toddler despite reassurances to the contrary.  And Mac absolutely
adored her brunette older sister.  </p>
<p>"Boo!  Boo!" Mac exclaimed pointing at the fallen stuffed animal.
Sam stopped her dancing and bent down to scoop up the toddler's toy,
ignoring the minor surge of still lingering dizziness the movement
caused her.</p>
<p>"Here ya go, Mac," she said and then set the child down on the
couch.  Brooke walked in and wrapped her arms around Sam from behind.</p>
<p>"That was the cutest thing I've seen in ages," she teased, eliciting
an embarrassed groan from Sam.  "I even got it on video."</p>
<p>"Oh God?" Sam muttered.</p>
<p>"Yes, blackmail material if I ever saw it," Terri added.</p>
<p>"Oh man?witnesses," Sam said mortified.  She shot a mock glare at her
audience. "You tell anyone and I swear I'll kill you all."  Her
mother just laughed at her along with everyone else.  Sam turned back
to Mac and pouted.</p>
<p>"No one takes me seriously anymore, Mac.  I've lost my edge," she
lamented with a heavy sigh as Brooke hugged her.  Mac held her arms
out and smiled.</p>
<p>"Fam?" the child requested.  Sam picked her up and held her while
Brooke in turn held Sam.  </p>
<p>"She said my name?well, sorta," Sam said happily as Mac snuggled in
her arms.  Terri picked up the discarded video camera and filmed the
three girls while they stood in the living room, a quiet moment
inside a somewhat tempestuous reality.</p>
<p>"Jane," she whispered. "Go join them so I can get all four of you on
film." Jane smiled and nodded, walking over to her daughters.  Terri
filmed the four interacting with each other for several minutes.</p>
<p>'This is my family now,' she decided quietly. 'And Heaven help anyone
who tries to destroy it.'</p>

<p>"So you're telling me, Herb, that the paperwork is rock solid?"
Nicole asked her attorney anxiously.  Her mothers recent efforts to
get into her substantial trust fund were starting to wear on the
young woman's nerves.  </p>
<p>"That woman already has more money than God. I don't see why she's so
intent on getting what's rightfully yours," Herb grumbled.  He really
didn't like Gayle Julian.  She was a money hungry harpy without a
soul in his opinion.  He'd thought for a while that Nicole would grow
up to be a mirror image of her mother.  He glanced at the pretty
Latin girl sitting next to Nicole, tightly holding the blonde's hand.
Lily Esposito was the best thing Herb had ever seen happen to
Nicole.  </p>
<p>Herb had personally handled all the paperwork concerning Nicole's
trust fund when her Nana (Miranda, a wonderful woman in Herb's
opinion) had set it up.  He and Miranda had made absolutely sure that
Gayle couldn't get anywhere near Nicole's money no matter what.  It
didn't surprise him that she was trying; the woman always harbored an
intense jealousy over the close bond between Miranda and Nicole.  It
stood to reason that she'd try to horn in anyway that she could.</p>
<p>"Because she's a greedy drunk?" Nicole shot back angrily.  She was
angry at her mother, not Herb.  Lily squeezed her hand in
comfort. "Sorry, Herb, didn't mean to snap." Herb waved it off with
an understanding smile.</p>
<p>"No offense taken, Nicole.  Totally understandable.  Look, you
honestly have nothing to worry about.  Gayle would need a diamond-
tipped, jet-fueled drill to even put a dent in the contract." He got
up and sat on the edge of the desk, closer to the girls, hoping to
ease their fears.</p>
<p>"Look, Nic, she knows that the only thing she can do about it is poke
at you and irritate you about the trust fund until you relent and
give her some of it?"</p>
<p>"Like Hell!" Nicole blurted out.  Herb smiled.</p>
<p>"I know that, Lily knows that.  Hell, somewhere in her little pea-
brain, Gayle knows that.  Miranda left that money for you, to provide
for your happiness.  She didn't care what you ultimately did with it
as long as you found your happiness." He smiled warmly at Lily. "And
anyone can see that you have, Nicole."</p>
<p>"And that annoys the ever-living shit out of Gayle.  She's a small
minded, petty woman who tried more than once to have poor Miranda
declared incompetent so that she could get her money.  And Miranda
had the strongest mind of anyone I'd ever met.  But Gayle didn't
care; she just wanted the money.  Your father wasn't much better."</p>
<p>"Yeah well, we don't talk about him much," Nicole mumbled. "Thank God
I'm actually adopted and don't share actual DNA with those people."</p>
<p>"You'd be lucky to 'share DNA' with someone as wonderful as your
Nana," Herb pointed out fondly. "Then again, I see more of her in you
all the time and that's what counts." Nicole blushed.</p>
<p>"So Gayle can't really do anything to hurt us?" Lily asked quietly.
She couldn't give one rat's ass about the money.  She didn't have
much growing up so the prospect of not having much as an adult wasn't
all that foreign to her.  It didn't worry her either.  She knew she
and Nicole could work it out, get jobs and be just as happy as
a 'blue-collar' couple as a 'rich' one.  She was just concerned that
Gayle's constant harassing of Nicole and investigation into her trust
fund was wearing Nicole down emotionally.  She could see the
irritation and the strain weighing on her blonde lover's shoulders
and she wanted to make sure that Gayle couldn't hurt Nicole even more.</p>
<p>"Nope, not really.  Other than annoy the crap out of you two, she
can't touch a dime," Herb smiled.  He leaned down and took Nicole's
free hand in his own.  All that time with Miranda and watching Nicole
grow, he felt that the girl was his own granddaughter and wanted
nothing more than to soothe her fears.</p>
<p>"Look, the long and short of it is this: she can't get to it.  She
can try, she can hire any amount of fancy lawyers she wants, hack and
slash at the contracts and paperwork until the end of time.  And
while maybe eventually somewhere down the line some judge might throw
her a bone just to shut her the hell up, she can't hurt you two.  Not
unless you LET her which is ultimately what she wants."</p>
<p>"She wants to get under your skin, annoy you and frustrate you until
you turn on each other.  Gayle can't stand that you disobeyed her,
Nicole.  And what's more, that you were successful in turning your
back on her, going after what YOU wanted and don't need her.  She
hates that you're happy, Nicole, and will do whatever she can to make
you UNhappy."</p>
<p>"Yeah, it seems that way," Nicole sighed.  Herb patted the hand that
he still held.</p>
<p>"Nic, she can only make you unhappy if you let her.  Remember that."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Mac toddled over to the bed and hauled herself up onto it.
Sometimes she wondered why big people made everything else so big
too.  It seemed unfair.  She was little, so everything should be
little too.  Or so she figured.</p>
<p>She rested for a second, (that bed was higher than she had
thought) and then crawled up towards the sleeping people in the bed.
Dark hair was mixed with blonde on the pillows at the head of the bed
making a pretty design so Mac occupied herself playing with the
strands for a little while.  She'd gotten bored playing with
her 'keeper' who'd fallen asleep in the playroom and wandered down
the hall.  She liked this new 'walking' thing, highly useful.</p>
<p>But she was getting bored again.  She tugged hard on a
handful of blonde hair and sleepy blue eyes opened to look up at her.</p>
<p>"Mac?  How did you get in here?" Mac smacked the blonde with
her ever present stuffed Blue.</p>
<p>"Play!" she giggled.</p>
<p>"Sleep, Mac.  I'm tired," the blonde complained.  Mac
frowned.  Her new playmate didn't want to play.  What was THAT about?</p>
<p>"Plaaaaaaay!" she said again, this time smacking the still
sleeping brunette.</p>
<p>"Ah, the terrible two's," the brunette sighed.  She reached
up and pulled Mac down into the bed. "Nap time, Mac." Mac pouted.</p>
<p>"Play?" she asked.</p>
<p>"No, Mac, no play.  Nap," she responded.  Then another
thought hit her. "How did you wander away from?"</p>
<p>"MOM!  I can't find Mac!" the door burst open as Sam charged
through, frantic that she'd lost the toddler when she had dozed off
on the floor of the playroom.  Brooke had found her sprawled out,
drooling on a giant stuffed Power Puff Girl.  She stumbled to a halt
in the doorway, Brooke hitting her in the back when she failed to
stop her own rush.</p>
<p>"What the Hell, Sam?" Brooke cursed.</p>
<p>"Uh?uh?uh?Mom?" Sam squeaked out upon seeing her mother in
bed with Brooke's Aunt Terri.  They'd obviously been spooning before
the interruptions.  Sam felt her brain stop.</p>
<p>"Sam?" Jane started as she watched her daughter pale out to a
frighteningly sick looking color.</p>
<p>"Oh my God!" Brooke gasped, one hand covering her mouth in
shock.</p>
<p>"Sam, Brooke, we can explain," Jane started again.  Sam's
head shook from side to side in such a fashion that Jane thought it
was going to fall off.</p>
<p>"I?I?and?you?and then?but you?and Mike?and?you totally
freaked out?but this?and I?" Sam stuttered making little to no
sense.  Brooke started to giggle.</p>
<p>"I think you broke her," she said to the shocked
adults. "Don't worry, I'll just take her away and when she calms down
and returns to sanity, we'll talk," she said, winking at her step-
mother and aunt.  Really, in some way it seemed to fit.</p>
<p>"I?I?" Sam was still stuttering.  Brooke put her hands on her
shoulders and turned her away from the room.</p>
<p>"Come on, Sammy, I'll make you some tea or hot chocolate,"
with one last smile at the adults, Brooke lead Sam from the room.
Jane looked at Terri and sighed.</p>
<p>"Oh, this is going to get messy," she complained.  Terri
nodded.</p>
<p>"Ayup."</p>

<hr></hr>

<p>"But?that was my?my?MOM?and?and?she was in bed with another
WOMAN!" Sam's eyes were saucer plate round and she was shaking as
Brooke sat her down at the table.  Brooke giggled again. </p>
<p>"Sammy, they were fully clothed," she pointed out. "On top of
the covers and there's no evidence that anything happened."</p>
<p>"But?my Mom doesn't DO that!" Sam finally started blinking
again as she tried to focus on Brooke.</p>
<p>"They were probably just talking and simply fell asleep,"
Brooke suggested.</p>
<p>'Riiiiiiiiiiiiight,' she mentally scoffed. 'And monkeys may
fly out of my low-rise jeans.'</p>
<p>"Brooke, don't patronize me," Sam glared.</p>
<p>"Oh look, full non-stammering sentences," Brooke
teased. "Glad to see your brain has begun functioning again."</p>
<p>"Brooke, how can you be so calm?" Sam nearly screeched.  "We
just saw MY Mom in bed with YOUR aunt and you act like it's nothing."
Brooke shrugged.</p>
<p>"Because it IS nothing, honey.  So what if they've discovered
something deeper between them?  Sam, we're the last people on the
planet that should judge."</p>
<p>"I'm not judging, Brooke," Sam contested. "But this is the
same woman who totally freaked out when we told her about OUR
relationship.  I mean, total meltdown to the point of disowning me
until she woke up to reality.  So now she's going to do a 180 and
suddenly discovering her 'inner butch'?  Pardon me for having trouble
getting my teeny tiny little brain to grasp the logic here."</p>
<p>"Sam?" Brooke pulled a chair up in front of Sam and sat down,
gently caressing the somewhat distraught and confused teen's
cheek. "When we came out to Jane, she was shocked.  Not only were her
daughter and step-daughter gay but they were involved WITH EACH
OTHER.  That would throw even the most tolerant person for a major
loop.  And then along with my father and his narrow-mindedness and
bigotry, she got carried along on it."</p>
<p>"But she came around and now we have the BEST relationship
with her that we could ever hope to have.  And now it looks like
she's putting the hurt and pain my father put her through behind her
and letting herself feel something for someone else.  Do you know how
frightened Jane must be?  If she has feelings for Terri, can you
imagine her fear and confusion?"</p>
<p>"Brooke?"</p>
<p>"No, Sam, let me finish," Brooke said firmly. "If she and
Terri are pursuing something together, let them.  It's time for Jane
to move on from the hurt Mike caused her and I KNOW my aunt.  She's
nothing like my Mom if that's what you're afraid of.  She's been
alone a long time because she's afraid of letting anyone too close.
If she'd letting Jane close?Sam, we can't begrudge them that.  It
wouldn't be fair, same as anyone trying to keep US apart isn't
fair."  </p>
<p>Sam sighed and ran a hand through her hair.</p>
<p>"It's not?it's not that although I do worry about Terri being
like Kelly," she admitted. "It's just, God, Brooke, my Mom involved
with a woman?  When the hell did THAT happen?"</p>
<p>"Aww, Sammy, we've joked about it before, remember?" Brooke
reminded her.</p>
<p>"We were KIDDING!" Sam objected. "Ug, my brain is melting."</p>
<p>"Sam, it's simple really," Brooke said softly. "Do you want
your mother to be happy?" Sam nodded. "What if Terri were the person
to make her happy?  Wouldn't you want that despite the fact that it's
totally wigging you out?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," Sam sighed again. "I like Terri.  I'm just shocked is
all."</p>
<p>"Now you know how I felt when you and Brooke told me," Jane
said quietly from the door where she stood with Mac in her arms and
Terri beside her.  She handed the toddler to Terri and walked over to
her daughter.</p>
<p>"Look, Sam, nothing happened between Terri and I.  I just?I
needed to feel?"</p>
<p>"Mom, you don't have to explain anything to me," Sam said,
starting to smile. "I'm OK, really.  Shock has worn off and normal
brain function has returned."</p>
<p>"Seriously, Sam.  I do?" Jane looked at Terri shyly and
blushed. "I won't lie.  I do feel something for Terri.  Something new
and scary and absolutely wonderful.  But, honey, I don't want to
upset you?"</p>
<p>"I'm a big girl, Mom," Sam countered. "And I'm not upset, I
swear.  It was just?like, whoa, when I opened the door." She glared
at Terri. "Yo, lock it next time, missy!" Terri had the good grace to
blush deeply.</p>
<p>"Hey, kiddo, I didn't plan for it to happen but I genuinely
like your mother," Terri said seriously. "We've decided to take it
slow and just see what happens.  But you know that you, Brooke, and
Mac are the most important things to her, right?" Sam nodded as
Brooke stroked her hair.</p>
<p>"OK then.  Whatever else happens, we'll deal with it like
adults," Terri said. "Open and honest.  No hiding anything." The
other women in the room nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>"Like a family," Jane added.</p>
<p>"A highly mutated family," Sam snorted.  Brooke swatted her
on the arm.</p>
<p>"Sam," she scolded.  Sam held her arms up in defense.</p>
<p>"What?  Oh like no one else sees it," she laughed. "I'm in
love with and involved with my former sorta step-sister; my Mom is
now involved with her former step-daughter's aunt.  God, we're so
inbred now we're like the sequel to 'Deliverance'."</p>
<p>"Ah, but we have all our teeth," Terri joked.</p>
<p>"Oh stop it you two," Jane laughed. "And girls, it's OK with
us if you let Nicole and Lily in on this new development but we have
to make sure Mike doesn't get wind of it.  He may try to use it as
leverage for custody."</p>
<p>"Shit," Sam swore. "We keep coming back to that oversized
thorn."</p>
<p>"Well, he is my Dad, Sam.  And Mac's.  He's going to be an
ongoing interruption to our lives," Brooke pointed out.</p>
<p>"Suckage," Sam mumbled.</p>
<p>"Yeah, but for right now, he can't hurt us," Terri
added. "And your Mom and I will do everything we can to keep it that
way."</p>
<p>Everyone was silent as the new news sunk in and they just
enjoyed the newly bonding family atmosphere they all found themselves
in.  Then, a soft voice singing broke the quiet.</p>
<p>"Mom and Terri up in the tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G?" </p>
<p>"Saaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam!  Stop that!"</p>
