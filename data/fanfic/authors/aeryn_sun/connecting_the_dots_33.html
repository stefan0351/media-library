<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Thirty Three -->

<p>The long white box sat silently on the Palace front doorstep for a while before anyone noticed it. Mike only noticed it because he tripped on it while going after the morning newspaper. He frowned as he picked it up, looking at the silk red ribbon holding it shut and the plain off-white envelope carefully tucked under the bow. He searched it for any sign of who left it but other than its intended's name written in script across the envelope, there was no indication of its origin.</p>
<p>"Brooke, there's a?package for you here," he called up the stairs as he walked into the house. Brooke poked her head out from her room and looked down at her father. Mike shrugged and held up the box. She exchanged confused looks with him as she walked down the stairs.</p>
<p>"Who's it from?" she asked around a mouthful of Jelly Belly's. Mike shrugged.</p>
<p>"I haven't a clue. Only your name is on the envelope. Here," he handed her the long box. Still frowning she pulled the envelope free and read the card. Mike watched as her frown deepened and then turned to a look of pure annoyance.</p>
<p>"Oh, for Christ's sake," she growled.</p>
<p>"What is it, honey?" Brooke shot her father a heated glare, cleared her throat and began to read the card out loud in a highly sarcastic tone of voice.</p>

<p style="margin-left:1cm;"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy">'My Dearest Brooke,</font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Calligraphy">A moment doesn't pass that I don't think about what we shared. The love, the laughter, the fun. How being with you filled this hole inside of me like nothing else. And I know that we can have that special connection again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Calligraphy">Somehow, you've lost your faith in my devotion to you. But that's all right, my love. I will prove myself to you again. Take these roses as a token of my quest for your heart. I will not stop until we again share what we once had.</font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Calligraphy">You've left your mark on me, dear lovely Brooke. It is one that cannot be seen. It lives in my skin. It is the mark of love.</font></p>
<p><font face="Lucida Calligraphy">And I will prove mine to you.</font></p>
<p style="margin-left:3cm;"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy">Love Always,</font></p>
<p style="margin-left:5cm;"><font face="Lucida Calligraphy">Harrison John'</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>"That's the worst piece of drivel I've ever heard. Even my high school love notes to Rachel Pembrooke were better than THAT!"</p>
<p>"And I bet you never had to lift lines from Harry Potter," Sam scoffed quietly from the kitchen doorway. Brooke laughed at the realization.</p>
<p>"That's right! I knew I'd heard that last line somewhere before," she said. She opened the box to find 12 of the most beautiful long-stem roses inside. Mike let out a low whistle.</p>
<p>"Bet those weren't cheap. Want to put them in some water?" Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"Shove them down the garbage disposal would be more accurate," she announced. Sam arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"You sure? They really are beautiful."</p>
<p>"Yes, but not at the price that comes with them, Sammy," Brooke pointed out. Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"I see your point," she agreed.</p>
<p>"Brooke, I think someone needs to talk to him," Mike said warily. "This thing could get out of control very fast."</p>
<p>"I know, Dad. I'll talk to him and tell him I'm not interested. AGAIN," Brooke sighed. "Although, honestly, I shouldn't HAVE to say it more than once."</p>
<p>"Some people are stupid that way," Sam joked, trying to lighten the mood. Brooke smirked.</p>
<p>"And stubborn. And that just about describes Harrison to a T."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke found Harrison sitting alone in the cafeteria the next day and, with Sam and Lily watching, carefully approached him. He looked up at her, his eyes lighting up as he saw who it was.</p>
<p>"Brooke! Hi! Sit down, join me," he beamed. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, Harrison. I just wanted to say something about the note and flowers you sent me yesterday." His face got impossibly more cheerful and he shot a look of triumph at Sam. She stuck out her tongue in response.</p>
<p>"Did you like the flowers? They were beautiful weren't they? And the note. I tried to write exactly how I felt. God, I must have gone through about 20 drafts before I send that last one," he just kept going. </p>
<p>"HARRISON!" Brooke nearly had to bellow to get his attention. He jumped and looked at her expectantly. To Brooke he resembled a puppy waiting for a treat for having done a trick. It was rather sad in her opinion.</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Please don't ever send me anything again," she said simply. "I don't care for you, in any way. I love Sam and that's that. Keep your roses," she took out a small paper bag and dumped the chopped remains of the roses on the table in front of him. "And keep your cheesy love notes." She also placed the shredded remains of the note on top of the destroyed flowers. By now the entire student body that was present was watching with rapt interest.</p>
<p>"Stay away from me and from Sam or I will go to the school administration and your mother," Brooke warned. "And I'm not joking." She turned on her heel and stalked back to her table where she sat down next to Sam, took out a chocolate bar and pretended that nothing had happened. The entire room laughed and snickered while pointing at Harrison. Growing red in the face, Harrison stood up and stormed out of the room.</p>
<p>"Well, that was entertaining," Sam said sarcastically. Brooke shrugged nonchalantly and went back to her lunch.</p>
<p>"I actually feel a little bad for Harrison," Lily said sadly. Brooke crooked an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Don't worry. You'll get over it," she said simply. Lily tilted her head and thought about it for a minute.</p>
<p>"Hmmm. You're right. I already have."</p>
