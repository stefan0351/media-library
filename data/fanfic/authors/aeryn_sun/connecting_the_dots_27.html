<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Twenty Seven -->

<p>The news that indeed Harrison was right and Sam and Brooke were a couple spread faster than a California wildfire through the halls of Kennedy High. Hardly anyone could believe that THE Brooke McQueen was gay and most blamed either Sam or the accident and some blamed both. Hardly anyone figured that it was actually what Brooke wanted. So, Sam was made out to be the bad guy who took advantage of a vulnerable and injured Brooke. Her school life quickly became a living hell. And leading the Anti-Sam brigade, standing beside Harrison, was none other than Nicole Julian.</p>
<p>She saw this as the perfect opportunity to not only destroy Sam but also rip that perfect little bitch McQueen off the throne that should have rightfully been hers. Damn it, Nicole knew she was the one that put Brooke there in the first place and now this new Brooke had even less of a claim to it than the original one did. But much to her chagrin, nothing seemed to stop Brooke from always winning. Not slander, not subterfuge, or sabotage and not even that damn accident. But maybe, just maybe, this juicy little tidbit would be what finally toppled the Reign of McQueen.</p>
<p>Not that Nicole actually had a real 'problem' with Brooke and Sam as a couple. OK, so she wouldn't have chosen Sam McPherson as a sapphic significant other for Brooke but the homosexual angle wasn't an issue. Plus, she'd seen a certain spark between the two stepsisters for a long time even if they didn't. It was hardly a surprise to her. But the whole amnesia slant was a chance to do damage that was too good for her to pass up. Here was Brooke, hurt in a horrible accident from which she emerged with no prior knowledge of who she was or what her boundaries once were. And now she was hooked up with her former archenemy and reluctant stepsister? Sam had to know that she was facing an uphill battle. And Nicole was just the person to shove her back down to the bottom, gleefully.</p>
<p>She glanced over at her coconspirators, Mary Cherry and ew, Harrison. That was the one big drawback to the whole situation. She had to spend time with the Court Jester of the Losers. She hated Harrison, he was SUCH a tool.</p>
<p>"It's just so?so WRONG," Harrison kept ranting. Nicole rolled her eyes. She'd heard his antigay rant so many times now she could recite it along with him even though she didn't agree. She wondered how the kid got along at home with his own mother and HER girlfriend if this was how he really acted. She did not see it as pleasant. </p>
<p>"And what gets me is that Sam doesn't even SEE how wrong she is. How she's corrupted poor, innocent Brooke," he went on. Nicole swallowed the nausea that rose to the back of her throat. Another annoying thing about Harrison was the fact that he was painting Brooke out to be this saint, tainted by the foul hands of the she-demon Sam. He was getting to be a little extreme. </p>
<p>He had even entertained the idea of staging an 'intervention' on Brooke's behalf, a la 'But I'm a Cheerleader' and trying to show Brooke the error of her ways. To take the former cheerleader away from Sam and 'deprogram' her. In Nicole's opinion, it was one step away from kidnapping. She'd managed to talk him out of it, only because she reminded him that Brooke had parents that might get angry and call the police if he took her against her will. He didn't like being reminded of that little fact but he listened nonetheless.</p>
<p>Now as they sat in the school cafeteria watching Sam and Brooke sit a few tables away with Carmen and Lily, Nicole wondered about the mental stability of Mr. Harrison John. So on top of hatching her plan to destroy Sam and dethrone Brooke, she realized that she was going to have to keep an eye on him and how close to the edge he actually got. As cold-blooded as she happily admitted she was, she didn't want anyone to actually get physically injured. The near accident last spring had taught her a few things about herself she didn't like. And the incident in gym also showed her how far she'd fallen. Now she was careful of watching where the boundaries of getting what she wanted and going TOO far were.</p>
<p>"Whut Ah don' git is why we didn' see this thang between them before, y'all," Mary Cherry added her two cents to the conversation. Nicole looked up from her musings and focused her attention on the slightly deranged Southerner.</p>
<p>"Ah mean, we're intelligent bein's, yerself excluded, Joe," she said sadly to Harrison who simply rolled his eyes. "Shouldn't we have noticed sumthin' if this wuz sumthin' Brookie wanted like she sez it is?"</p>
<p>"THAT'S MY POINT!" Harrison bellowed slamming his fist on the table and making half the room jump.</p>
<p>"Harrison," Nicole snapped. "Either act human or go sit with the rest of the social rejects." Harrison had the good grace to look embarrassed.</p>
<p>"Sorry," he mumbled. "But my point is that if Sam was who Brooke wanted in the first place, why did she even bother to date me? Or Josh? Why didn't we see anything between them BEFORE the accident? I mean, obviously Sam used Brooke's memory loss to pervert her emotions and perceptions and something needs to be done."</p>
<p>Nicole wanted to point out to Harrison that anyone with any sort of observation skills (therefore eliminating himself and Mary Cherry) would have noticed the chemistry between the two girls long ago but she kept that information to herself. It wouldn't do to make an enemy of one of her only allies, however reluctant she was to have him as one. </p>
<p>"At any rate," Nicole broke in to stop yet another Harrison rant. "Aside from the slightly stalker-esque kidnapping ideas," she looked pointedly at Harrison. "Any ideas about exactly what we ARE going to do to the 'happy couple'?" The troublesome threesome was quiet as they thought.</p>
<p>"We could git a priest ta perform an exorcism, y'all!" Mary Cherry exclaimed suddenly. Nicole arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"Excuse me?" she asked. Mary Cherry started to get animated as she began speaking.</p>
<p>"Well, it's obvious ta me tha' lil' ol' Sammy has poor Brookie under some sorta spell and she's got the Dev-il inside her. She needs an exorcism!" she declared apparently making perfect sense. At least to herself.</p>
<p>"Mary Cherry," Nicole started tiredly. Honestly she wondered sometimes why she surrounded herself with someone so far removed from reality. Then she remembered Mary Cherry's credit limit and everything was clear again.</p>
<p>"Mary Cherry, there will be no exorcism. Brooke is not possessed by anything other than a chronic case of bad judgment." She heard Harrison snort.</p>
<p>"That's obvious, choosing Sam over me," he mumbled. Nicole barely managed to keep herself from strangling the little prick. She was liking him less and less and wasn't aware that was even possible.</p>
<p>"Anyway, I was thinking something more?discreet," she said through her teeth. Mary Cherry and Harrison looked back at her with blank looks. </p>
<p>"Oh for Christ's sake, you losers," she snapped. "Try and keep up. First we make sure the ENTIRE school knows what Sam has done and what's going on between her and Brooke. That should put a damper on their 'happiness'. Then we bring proof of their activities to their parents. How do you think Jane and Mike will react to their perfect little nuclear family going global? That Brooke and Sam have been playing their own version of 'house'?" she said evilly.</p>
<p>"Ooooh, that's evvviiiillll," Mary Cherry cooed excited. Nicole nodded with a snide grin.</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Meanwhile, a few tables away, Sam and Brooke had watched the entire scene unfold at Nicole's table.</p>
<p>"You ever get the feeling those three are up to no good?" Sam asked sarcastically. Brooke, Lily, and Carmen nodded.</p>
<p>"What frightens me is Harrison's turn to the dark side," Lily sighed. </p>
<p>"I can't believe Nicole willingly lets him sit with her," Carmen added.</p>
<p>"I'm just glad you got that stick out of your ass," Brooke said to Carmen. "It couldn't have been comfortable to sit with it jammed up so far."</p>
<p>"BROOKE!" Sam hissed. Brooke looked at her innocently.</p>
<p>"What?" Sam just shook her head. Sometimes she envied Brooke's ability to get away with saying whatever she wanted and blaming it on the amnesia. She had to admit, Brooke did have a point concerning Carmen.</p>
<p>"Well, I still have my?'issues' with you two and your?relationship," Carmen admitted. "But you're my friends and I guess if you're happy, that's all that's important."</p>
<p>"Thank you," Sam said quietly. Things were hard on her enough as they were; having another friend turn on her because she loved Brooke would have been too much. She was stressed almost to her limit and trying desperately not to show it, plus she was worried about Brooke and her increasingly distant behavior.</p>
<p>"So, I guess we'll just have to keep an eye on those three yahoo's and make sure they don't do anything 'fanatical,'" Lily decided. The other three at the table nodded their silent agreement.</p>
