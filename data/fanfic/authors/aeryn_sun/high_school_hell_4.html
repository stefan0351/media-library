<!-- High School Hell \ Rising Tide -->

<p>Brooke lay on the couch in Sam's arms watching an incredibly lame movie when Mike came down the stairs. She smiled in greeting and opened her mouth to speak when he raised a finger to his lips and pointed behind her. Brooke turned her head and saw that Sam was sound asleep behind her. Chuckling slightly, she gingerly extracted herself from Sam's grasp, earning herself a grumbled complaint from the slumbering form and followed her father into the kitchen. </p>
<p>"Hey ya Dad," she smiled. Mike smiled back. </p>
<p>"Hi Brooke, how was your day?" she frowned at the question. Mike nodded. "Jane told me about the doctor visit. Seems like that night keeps coming back to haunt you two, doesn't it?" he asked sympathetically. Brooke flopped down in a chair and sighed. She ran a hand through her hair. </p>
<p>"It's not fair, Dad," she complained in typical teenage fashion. "She did the right thing, pushed me out of the way. Why does she have to pay for that mistake for the rest of her life?" she asked near tears. Mike enveloped his daughter in a comforting hug. </p>
<p>"First off, it wasn't a mistake and Sam would be the first to tell you that. Second, some things can't be helped. She's a strong young lady, she'll make it through this, she always does." Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"We all have our breaking points, Dad. Eventually, we're going to hit Sam's. And I'm afraid of what's going to happen when we do," she confided. </p>
<p>"Then you'll just have to be there for her. We all will," he told her confidently. He was slowly coming to terms with the girls' relationship in his own way. Besides, all he really wanted was for Brooke to be happy and Sam made her happy. </p>
<p>"I know, Dad, I'm just worried. Sam isn't the most open person when it comes to letting people help her. When, if that point ever arrives, what if she won't let us help?" Mike considered this for a minute. </p>
<p>"What did she do when you wouldn't take help after she left?" he asked, refering to Brooke's most recent bout with her eating disorder. Brooke frowned. </p>
<p>"She waited me out, was patient and loving but firm until I listened. She let me know that she wasn't letting me go and that she loved me," she said. Mike smiled. </p>
<p>"I think you have your answer. Remember that when the road gets rocky, Brooke. It probably won't be easy, we both know how stubborn the girl can be. Stand by her, Brooke and hold on to her. If you do that, then she'll have no choice but to let you help." </p>

<p>"Hey beautiful," Sam whispered the next morning as Brooke rolled over and opened her eyes. Sam kissed the tip of her nose. Brooke sighed happily and snuggled closer. </p>
<p>"You always make me feel so good," she whispered into Sam's chest. Sam chuckled. </p>
<p>"It's too early in the morning for that and all I did was say `hey'," she said. </p>
<p>"You said `hey beautiful'," Brooke corrected. Sam brushed some hair away from Brooke's face. </p>
<p>"Uh-huh, statement of fact. You are beautiful." </p>
<p>"You say it like it's a simple thing," Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"It is. The sky is blue, grass is green, spiders are icky and Brooke McQueen is the most breathtaking creature to walk the planet," Sam said almost in prayer. Brooke raised her face to see if Sam was joking but Sam's face was set in `serious' mode. </p>
<p>"Where were you when my mother said otherwise?" Brooke wondered outloud. Sam felt a familiar flash of anger at Brooke's mother for the emotional damage that the woman had done to Brooke. (If I ever get my hands on you again, lady, we are going to have a LONG talk) Sam kissed Brooke's forehead.</p>
<p>"Princess, I would give anything to erase what she said but I can't. But I can tell you that I love you and I think you're beautiful," Sam said simply, pulling Brooke closer to her until there was no space between them. Brooke sighed happily. </p>
<p>"It's enough, Sammy. It's enough. What are we going to do today?" she asked to change the subject from the heavy one they started with.</p>
<p>"Well, it's Saturday, I thought we'd go to the beach or something," Sam suggested. </p>
<p>"Hmmm, I'd like that," Brooke agreed. She listened to the reassuring thump thump of Sam's heart. There was never a sweeter sound to Brooke's ears. To her it was music. "Can we stay here a bit longer, though?" Sam laughed. </p>
<p>"As long as you want, love," Sam answered. "Forever, if it suits you." </p>

<p>The beach was hot but not stifling and Sam would pay good money to see Brooke in a bikini like the one the blonde was currently sporting. (Heh, postage stamps and dental floss would cover more) Sam mused. She herself was wearing a tasteful blue one piece and was lying on a towel watching Brooke splash in the nearby surf. She watched, with a certain amount of concern, as a familiar looking guy approached Brooke. </p>
<p>Brooke spoke with the guy for a few seconds and then turned away. Sam's alarm grew when the guy reached out and grabbed Brooke's arm. Sam was up and off the towel in record time and by Brooke's side in seconds. She immediately recognized the guy as a schoolmate, Pierce Shepard. </p>
<p>"Hey, guys, what's up?" she asked, her tone neutral. Pierce released Brooke's arm the second he saw Sam. </p>
<p>"Nothing, we were just talking," Pierce said quickly. Sam arched an eyebrow. </p>
<p>"Really, Pierce? Cuz I don't think talking and grabbing someone's arm are one and the same," Sam pointed out acidicly. Pierce glared at her. </p>
<p>"Sam, it's OK. Pierce was just leaving," Brooke said. Pierce looked insulted. </p>
<p>"I was not," he contested. Brooke crossed her arms. </p>
<p>"Let me rephrase that: `Pierce was just leaving ME'," she clarified. "Good-bye Pierce." </p>
<p>"Is it true, what they're saying about the two of you?" he snapped. Sam's eyes narrowed. </p>
<p>"Whatever it is, is no one's business," she retorted peevishly. </p>
<p>"Homosexuality is evil," Pierce hissed. Sam and Brooke rolled their eyes. </p>
<p>"Ignorance is evil, you stupid twerp," Sam growled. "Get over yourself." </p>
<p>"The Bible says that what you're doing is wrong," Pierce started. </p>
<p>"Look, Brooke, it's Mary Cherry's evil twin. Oh, wait, we played that game all ready," Sam quipped. She put her arm around Brooke's shoulder. "Come on, let's get away from this idiot." Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Let's." They left Pierce sputtering in the surf. </p>

<p>"You know, we're going to get that from time to time," Brooke pointed out from the passenger seat as Sam drove home later. Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"Unfortunately," Sam agreed reluctantly. "You'd think that we as a people would have come farther than that by now. I mean, even Disney offers medical benefits to gay couples now, don't they? If Disney says it's OK, isn't that enough?" she joked. Brooke blew out a frustrated breath. </p>
<p>"You always have to joke. Why?" Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"Because getting all worked up about it like you are will only make me sick to my stomach, love. I'm sorry, you know that jokes are my defense mechanism. Yes, I'm bothered by that scene back there on the beach. I wanted today to be just us enjoying the day. I didn't want it ruined by some small minded jerk," Sam said honestly. </p>
<p>"Thank you for your honesty," Brooke said with a smile. "And there's still plenty of the day we can enjoy. How about going to a movie?" Sam's eyebrows shot up. </p>
<p>"Ooo, dark theatre, back row seats, and you and me? Count me in." </p>
