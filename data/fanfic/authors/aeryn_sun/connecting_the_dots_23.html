<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Twenty Three -->

<p>Brooke rolled over and wrapped her arms around a sleeping Sam. Even in her sleep, the other girl snuggled closer to the blonde and sighed. Brooke watched Sam's face as she slept, looking so content and happy. It warmed her heart and made it ache at the same time.</p>
<p>She reached over and traced Sam's face lightly with her fingertips. It was something she enjoyed doing when she was laying with Sam and all of Sam's walls were down. It was a tactile sensation that burned from her fingers all the way down her arm throughout her body. She thought of it as a way of memorizing Sam at her most innocent.</p>
<p>"So beautiful," Brooke whispered in awe as she outlined Sam's lips. She was careful to avoid the still tender spot on Sam's bottom lip where she had hit her. Her guilt over what she'd done still ate at her and twisted her stomach.</p>
<p>&lt;How can she forgive me for that?&gt; she wondered. Her own self-loathing over hurting Sam sometimes got the better of her. But her anger at Harrison for adding to it was even stronger. Sam had needed a few stitches after he had added to it. Brooke hoped, for her own mental well being, that it didn't scar. Being constantly reminded that she wounded the girl she loved would forever twist her insides.</p>
<p>Over the past week since the incident in the hall at school, Harrison was growing more and more hostile towards them both, but mostly Sam. He'd shove her in that hall, trip her whenever possible and was slowly spreading the word about her 'obsession and corruption of a brain damaged' Brooke. Already several people had confronted Sam about what she was doing, leaving her to defend her actions as nothing more than helping Brooke and lying about their true relationship. Brooke understood why Sam was doing so but it still hurt her to listen to. She loved Sam so deeply that she wanted to scream it from the highest mountaintop, grab the school's PA system and announce it to the entire school's population, anyway she could she wanted the world to know that she loved Samantha McPherson and that Sam loved her back. But Sam wasn't ready for that. She still held onto her image and expectations, the same things that ironically, the accident that brought them together had freed Brooke from.</p>
<p>She'd spoken to Sam about it that night after dinner with the parentals and Sam had promised that she'd try to find a way to be as straightforward as Brooke was. But she was still afraid of what everyone else was going to think and what Harrison was doing wasn't helping her any. It was everything that she was afraid of. He was lying and saying that she was taking advantage of Brooke's condition to get what she wanted and she was scared that it was going to seem that way. Brooke had argued that it didn't matter what others thought as long as THEY knew the truth. But Sam was also scared that it was going to get back to Mike and Jane and then what were they going to do. Brooke agreed that that was going to be tough and tried to soothe Sam's fears. After the parents went out to a late movie, she and Sam tenderly made love, showing each other how much they did care and fell asleep in each other's arms.</p>
<p>Now as she lay still holding Sam close to her heart, Brooke understood what Sam was afraid of. No matter what they did or said to convince people otherwise, Brooke realized that some people were always going to figure that Sam did indeed 'brainwash' the injured Brooke into thinking that she loved her. And while Brooke knew this to be untrue, it was still a heavy weight for poor Sam to carry.</p>
<p>"Mmmm?Brooke?" Sam muttered as she woke up a little. She opened her deep brown eyes and looked directly into Brooke's face as the blonde continued marking her face with her fingers.</p>
<p>"Yes, Sammy?" she whispered back, mesmerized by the beauty beside her. Sam, although still sleepy, arched an eyebrow and watched the somewhat far away look in Brooke's eyes as she moved.</p>
<p>"What do you see when you look at me?" Sam asked suddenly, her voice hushed. She didn't know why she asked but she wanted to understand the odd look in Brooke's eyes. Brooke blinked and seemed to return to the present as she looked Sam in the eyes.</p>
<p>"I see?" she started, smiling wide as she leaned in for a quick kiss. "The woman I love," she said softly. "Who makes me so happy to be alive and makes me feel safe." She traced Sam's delicate eyebrows slowly.</p>
<p>"I see an incredible beauty who sometimes doesn't give herself enough credit," she added. "You light up any room you're in, Sam, and you never even realize it. You have this innocence about you that's captivating, and beguiling. Sometimes, I get so lonely and scared not knowing who I was or?stuff," her voice faded for a minute and Sam reached up to stroke her face gently for reassurance.</p>
<p>"And then I think about you and the fact that you love me and then I'm not so scared because you are my rock, Sam. You're all I need. So what do I see when I look at you?" she asked leaning in again so that her face hovered above Sam's.</p>
<p>"I see my other half. The other half of my soul that I'm incomplete without, Sammy. I see my heart," she kissed Sam passionately, feeling her respond vigorously and tasting the salt from Sam's tears.</p>
<p>"Don't cry, baby," she soothed as Sam quietly cried. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"I love you so much, Brooke. I thought you didn't understand but what you just said, oh God, you do!" Sam sobbed. She kissed Brooke again and moaned as Brooke deepened the kiss.</p>
<p>"I understand, Sam," Brooke murmured huskily. "More than you know." Sam gasped as Brooke slid effortlessly on top of her, bare skin burning into bare skin. Brooke nipped at Sam's ear, earning herself a hiss of pleasure as her thigh slipped between Sam's legs. Sam groaned and arched against her.</p>
<p>"Shhh, Sammy, let's take our time. There's no hurry," she purred into Sam's ear as they both began a slow rocking motion against each other.</p>
<p>"How is it?you make me feel so good?" Sam gasped as she ground a little harder against Brooke and the blonde teased her nipples with her fingers.</p>
<p>"Because I love you," Brooke answered simply, proud of herself. She watched as Sam smirked, her eyes hooded and dark with desire.</p>
<p>"I love you too," Sam responded. A chill ran through Brooke at hearing those words from her lover.</p>
<p>"Sammy?" Brooke moaned as they quickly got lost in each other. Alone in their understanding of each other, they gently made love until they fell asleep exhausted.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Jane watched the two girls bound over the stairs, their giggles and voices carrying easily to where she sat. Something was up with those two, she knew it. But her mind was having trouble wrapping itself around what it could be. Since the accident and Brooke's reawakening, the two teens had grown steadily closer and while on one hand Jane thought it was a good thing, she was somewhat hesitant about where it seemed to be heading.</p>
<p>"Morning girls," she said in greeting. Sam looked up from under bangs that desperately needed a trim and smiled.</p>
<p>"Morning Mom," she chirped as she headed into the kitchen.</p>
<p>"Morning," Brooke echoed. </p>
<p>"Brooke, can I talk to you a minute?" Jane asked. Sam and Brooke exchanged glances and shrugs before Sam left the room and Brooke sat down on the couch across from Jane.</p>
<p>"Sure, what's up?" she asked warily. She wasn't as familiar with Jane as she once was but there was something in her stepmother's expression that was worrying her.</p>
<p>"How are you doing, honey?" Jane asked quietly. Brooke stifled the annoyed groan that always followed that question. She knew Jane was only being a concerned and loving parent but sometimes she wondered if she was going to have to take out an add in the LA Times to convince everyone that she was indeed doing quite well.</p>
<p>"I'm fine. Better than fine, actually," she responded blandly.</p>
<p>"I hear you've called Dr. Claremont about finding a way to deal with your 'anger' issues?" Jane prompted carefully. She didn't want to accidentally set off one of Brooke's tantrums but wanted to know how her treatment was going. Brooke rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I agreed to start talking to someone who specializes in helping people with drastic memory loss readjust to their lives. So?" she couldn't help the sarcastic and somewhat caustic tone that had crept into her voice. Her defenses automatically went up whenever anyone aside from Sam started poking around in her treatment.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Brooke," Jane apologized hanging her head. "I just wanted to know what's going on with you, how you're doing. I still love you, you're still my daughter and your father and I are worried about you." Brooke instantly felt like kicking herself. Here Jane was simply expressing concern and she had effectively kicked the woman in the teeth.</p>
<p>&lt;Real smooth, McQueen&gt; she chided herself.</p>
<p>"Sorry," she sighed to her mother. "Didn't mean to snap."</p>
<p>"It's all right, I understand," Jane assured her. "I'm just glad you and Sam seem so?close." Brooke frowned slightly at the slight undertones of confusion and something else in Jane's tone.</p>
<p>"Yeah, we're?close," she said using the same word in the same tone Jane had. </p>
<p>"And that's?good?" Jane asked, looking Brooke directly in the eye. Suddenly Brooke realized that there was a whole other conversation taking place within the one they were having and her heart leapt into her throat.</p>
<p>&lt;Oh shit, I think she knows&gt; she panicked. She managed to nod as a lump of fear formed in her throat.</p>
<p>"Very?good," again she parroted Jane perfectly, understanding what Jane was really asking. Jane seemed to pale for a moment and took a deep breath. </p>
<p>She closed her eyes and leaned back, rubbing her eyes with the pads of her fingertips. When she reopened her eyes and looked at Brooke, Brooke noticed that they looked a little sad but not angry.</p>
<p>"You make each other happy," Jane said more as a statement then as a question. A small smile slowly spread across Brooke's face as she nodded.</p>
<p>"Very happy," she agreed. Jane let out another sigh.</p>
<p>"And you're sure?" There was no anger in Jane's voice, just a need to understand and to be absolutely positive that she was seeing what she thought she was seeing between the two girls.</p>
<p>"I was sure before the accident," Brooke said answering an unvoiced question. She knew Jane was wondering if it was a 'new' Brooke thing or something else and she desperately wanted Jane to know that it was something the 'old' Brooke would have wanted as well.</p>
<p>"You're both sure?" Again Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes," she said simply. Jane seemed to deflate for a minute and a strange eerie silence descended over the living room. It was broken when Sam reentered the room carrying a bagel for Brooke.</p>
<p>"Big pow-wow done with?" she joked, not picking up on the slight tension between the two other occupants of the room. Brooke and Jane exchanged looks before Jane nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes, Sam, we're done," she said. She leaned over and put her hand on Brooke's knee. "As long as you're happy," she whispered with a small smile. Brooke looked at her stepmother and grinned.</p>
<p>"I am. And we are."</p>
