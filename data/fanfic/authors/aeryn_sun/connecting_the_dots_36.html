<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Thirty Six -->

<p>School the next day seemed drag for both girls. Both were anxious for it to end although they weren't looking forward to their plans. But upon arriving at school there was yet another gift waiting for Brooke; a dozen long stemmed white roses along with a pair of tickets for the upcoming sold-out Pink concert. Front row center seats, to be exact.</p>
<p>"Where is dirt-poor Harrison getting the money for all this stuff?" Brooke wondered out loud to Sam after school as they walked down the hall to the exit into the parking lot. Sam looked thoughtful for a few seconds.</p>
<p>"Well, when we were little, he used to show me these prize baseball cards his dad left behind. He LOVED those things, kept them in pristine condition. Not one fingerprint, a crease, or a crack on them. They were mint and he was anal about keeping them that way," she remembered. "Maybe he decided to sell them. They WOULD be worth a pretty penny by now." Brooke groaned.</p>
<p>"Great, just great," she muttered under her breath. "He could do that and his Mom would never know."</p>
<p>"Exactly," Sam agreed. Brooke inspected the concert tickets when they got into Sam's car.</p>
<p>"Still, awesome seats to an awesome concert. I hate to give them up," she whined, giving Sam her best 'puppy dog' look. Sam laughed.</p>
<p>"I know and I feel the same way but I seriously doubt he intended you and ME to go to the concert," she pointed out logically. "We CAN'T go." Brooke sighed and looked crestfallen.</p>
<p>"I know you're right. I hate it, but I know you're right. Damn it," she grumbled.</p>
<p>"Then again," Sam smirked. "It would be a perfect opportunity to teach the little prick a lesson. That he can't buy or bribe your affections." She waggled her eyebrows as she spoke. "When is that concert again?" Brooke's eyes lit up.</p>
<p>"Next Friday," she grinned. "Really, Sammy, in the interest of showing him what's what, I should send back the flowers and keep the tickets," she tried to fake logic. Sam laughed.</p>
<p>"Well, let's see what his Mom has to say about it. That's only fair. Aside from that, I'm tired of always doing the right thing. Shit, I wanna have some fun. I say, in the immortal words of Pink herself, 'Let's get this party started!'"</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>They waited until Robin got home from work to go see her. They enlisted Carmen and Lily's help to keep Harrison out while they were there. The last thing they needed was for Harrison to show up while they were sitting at the kitchen table with his mother. God only knew what he'd do then.</p>
<p>"Hello Sam, hello Brooke," Robin smiled as she greeted them at the door. "Uhm, Harrison isn't home right now. I think he's out at the movies with Lily and Carmen."</p>
<p>"We know. We sent him there," Sam broke in.</p>
<p>"Actually, Mrs. John, we came to talk to you," Brooke explained quietly. Robin's eyes grew wide and she frowned.</p>
<p>"Me? Why would you want to talk to me?" she asked surprised.</p>
<p>"It's about Harrison?" Brooke started.</p>
<p>"He's stalking Brooke," Sam finished for her. Brooke shot her a dirty look.</p>
<p>"Sam, 'stalking' is an awfully strong word to use," she argued. Sam arched an eyebrow and crossed her arms defiantly.</p>
<p>"And exactly what term WOULD you use?" she challenged. Brooke bit her lip.</p>
<p>"Er?overly fixated on me?" she supplied. Sam rolled her eyes and looked pointedly at Robin.</p>
<p>"Read: stalking," she said sarcastically. Robin shook her head in confusion.</p>
<p>"Why don't you two come inside and explain what's going on?" she suggested. Sam and Brooke followed her into the house and sat at the kitchen table. They waited patiently as Robin got them sodas and made herself a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>"How are you doing, Brooke?" she asked concerned. "We were all afraid that we were going to lose you after that accident. And Harrison tells me that the amnesia has you all mixed up?"</p>
<p>"The amnesia had me lost for a bit but, Sam helped me through," Brooke said to her rather curtly. She hated the thought of Harrison filling his mother's head with all sorts of lies about her and Sammy. It made her blood boil to think about. "Don't believe everything Harrison tells you. He's not exactly CNN." Robin cast a sad look at Sam.</p>
<p>"He's told me that you've corrupted her, Sam," she said quietly. "He claims you've taken advantage of her weakened mental state to get what you want. He uses terms like 'perverted' and 'aberrant.'"</p>
<p>"Hmm, didn't know 'aberrant' was even in the little jerks vocabulary," Sam sighed. Brooke's face had flushed red and she was grinding her teeth as she stroked Sam's back in comfort.</p>
<p>"Oh for the love of God," she growled. "Look, Mrs. John, Sam didn't?" Robin shook her head.</p>
<p>"I know, Brooke," Robin interrupted her. "I know he's twisting things to suit his own agenda. I knew he had 'issues' but, I didn't realize until just recently how bad they really were."</p>
<p>"He goes on and on about how Sam tricked you into a relationship, Brooke," Robin continued. Her tone of voice told both girls exactly what she thought of her son's opinion. She sounded downright disgusted with him. "I've heard that you two are dating and I highly doubt that Harrison's version of events in anywhere near accurate."</p>
<p>"So, you know that he seems to blame Sammy for all of this?" Brooke asked. Robin nodded. "Well, now he's taken to threatening her by hanging stuffed bunnies and if I get my hands on him first, I'm going to break his nose."</p>
<p>"He did WHAT?" Robin asked, shocked.</p>
<p>"He mutilated an old stuffed rabbit that Sam gave him when they were little and left it on our back doorstep with a note to stay away from me," Brooke went on, her voice getting angrier and angrier as she spoke.</p>
<p>"Tuggers?" Robin turned to Sam. Sam nodded silently.</p>
<p>"And he hit her too," Brooke seethed.</p>
<p>"Brooke, I hit him first," Sam tried to protest. Robin's face grew red with anger, almost rivaling Brooke's with underlying rage.</p>
<p>"He hit you, Sam? I don't care if you hit him first; you probably had good reason. And I didn't raise my son to strike women," she growled. "Is there more that I should know?" Brooke and Sam exchanged looks.</p>
<p>"Tell me, please," Robin requested. Her heart was breaking but she had to know.</p>
<p>"He keeps sending me stuff," Brooke added hesitantly.</p>
<p>"Like what?"</p>
<p>"Flowers, jewelry?" Brooke started to list the items.</p>
<p>"Cheesy love notes," Sam added. Brooke shushed her.</p>
<p>"Stuffed animals, concert tickets," she held up the two tickets to Pink. "I've sent everything back but these. Honestly, I'm a little reluctant to part with them."</p>
<p>"How is he affording all of this?" Robin wondered bewildered. </p>
<p>"The baseball cards, we figure," Sam told her. Robin shook her head.</p>
<p>"Sam, you KNOW how he feels about those cards. They're the only thing he's got left from his father," Robin protested.</p>
<p>"I know," Sam conceded. "But it's the only thing we can figure. Plus I also know how he feels about Brooke. And homosexuality." Robin hung her head.</p>
<p>"I can't believe this," she breathed. "I mean, I DO, but this is my little boy. Where did I go wrong?" Brooke reached across the table and placed her hand over Robin's.</p>
<p>"It's not your fault, Mrs. John," she assured the older woman. "You raised Harrison to be a sweet, loving young man."</p>
<p>"And somewhere inside the creep he is now, that good man still exists," Sam said quietly. Robin and Brooke stared at her, surprised by the comment. Sam looked away unable to maintain eye contact with either of them.</p>
<p>"I have to believe," she started and stopped when her voice broke. She coughed to clear her throat and tried again.</p>
<p>"I have to believe that my best friend doesn't hate me so much," she began. "We were so close for so long. Hell, we practically lived in each other's back pockets growing up. The only thing we ever really argued about, ironically, was Brooke," she gave a sardonic smile. She looked up from the tablecloth and finally locked eyes with the other women at the table.</p>
<p>"I cannot sit here and believe that he'd simply forget or dismiss a connection like that. Even over this. I just can't," she finished quietly.</p>
<p>"I understand your point, Sam. And I hope you're right," Robin said gently, sympathetically. "I just don't know what to do." Brooke rubbed at the bridge of her nose with her fingers.</p>
<p>"We don't know either," she sighed. Sam could see that the stress was getting to the young blonde and reached over to gently pat Brooke's thigh. Brooke smiled slightly at her in thanks.</p>
<p>"Could you talk to him maybe?" Brooke asked. "It doesn't seem to do any good when Sam or I try. Maybe he'll listen to his own mother. Because if it doesn't stop, my Dad says he'll call the police. I don't mean to threaten or anything?"</p>
<p>"You're not, Brooke," Robin assured her. "Mike is justified in being concerned and taking the necessary steps to protect his family. I'm just sorry that it's my son that you need protecting from. I'll talk to Harrison, see if he'll listen to reason. Maybe even get him into some therapy."</p>
<p>"We'd appreciate some help," Sam admitted. Robin nodded.</p>
<p>"Thank you for coming to me with this. I know it couldn't have been easy."</p>
<p>"You have a right to know," Sam observed. Just then Brooke's cell phone rang. She picked it up and stared at it.</p>
<p>"Text message from Lily. Harrison's leaving the theater, we gotta go," she told Sam.</p>
<p>"OK," Sam said standing up. "Thanks again for your time, Robin."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Sam. Here, Brooke, keep the tickets. Think of them as a get well present." Robin winked at the girls. "It's obvious how much you two want to go. Have fun."</p>
<p>"Thanks!" the girls chirped in unison as they headed to the car.</p>
<p>When they reached the car, Brooke handed Sam the keys.</p>
<p>"Will you drive, please? I'm getting a blistering migraine," she explained wincing.</p>
<p>"Sure," Sam agreed. "You OK?" she asked as they drove away. "I thought those things were tapering off."</p>
<p>"It's just the stress," Brooke sighed, closing her eyes and leaning her head back against the headrest. They were quiet for the next few minutes.</p>
<p>"Sam, pull over," Brooke said urgently. Without asking any questions, Sam did as she was asked. As soon as the car stopped, Brooke undid her seat belt, opened the door and vomited repeatedly. Sam got out from her side of the car and dashed around to Brooke's side.</p>
<p>"Honey, are you all right?" she asked close to panic. "Do you need to go to the hospital?"</p>
<p>"No, no hospital," Brooke croaked. She was ghostly pale, shaking like a leaf, and sweating profusely. She was gulping in great gasps of air as if she couldn't seem to breathe.</p>
<p>"What is it, Brooke? I'm worried," Sam said concerned, stroking Brooke's forehead.</p>
<p>"I saw it," Brooke breathed. Sam frowned.</p>
<p>"Saw what?" she asked confused. Brooke eyes opened. They were glassy and red.</p>
<p>"The accidents. Both of them," Brooke tried to explain. Sam gasped in understanding.</p>
<p>"Your accident. The tree," she said out loud.</p>
<p>"And Prom night," Brooke added, suddenly looking Sam in the eyes with an intensity she rarely saw. "Jesus, Sammy," she sobbed. Sam frowned again.</p>
<p>"What?" She wasn't following.</p>
<p>"That car, Nicole car. It was going so fast. I was sure that I was a goner. And then you were there. I was safe but I lost sight of you. I thought you'd been killed," she started to cry in earnest. "You died to save me. Do you have any idea what it's like to feel something like that? Someone gave their life for yours?"</p>
<p>"Brooke, honey, I'm right here," Sam tried to soothe but Brooke wasn't looking at her anymore. She was staring straight ahead at some distant point, unseeing as tears streamed down her face.</p>
<p>"I kept thinking, 'Oh please, not my Sammy. I can't lose her.' I loved you so much even then that it would have killed me," she sobbed. "And then I saw you on the pavement, so still, unmoving. I screamed your name but you didn't move." Sam was silent letting the memory run its course hoping that it'd burn itself out and let Brooke go soon.</p>
<p>"I ran over to you, so scared that I was going to find you dead. I prayed to God, or anyone that would listen. I bargained, my life for yours, gladly, if only you were still breathing. They could have me if you were alive. Your dress was ripped," she added absently.</p>
<p>"I touched you and you still didn't move," she continued quietly. "I moved you so that you were on your back and?and there was blood. Your blood," she stared down at her fingers as if seeing the stain on her hands again. She then looked up and locked eyes with Sam for a moment before tracing a spot above Sam's left hairline.</p>
<p>"I hit my head on the asphalt," Sam explained softly. "Knocked me cold for a few minutes. But I was OK, Brooke," she grasped Brooke's hand tightly. "You called for me again, begged me to wake up. You touched my face and I came to, remember?" she urged. Slowly, Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"I've never been so relieved to see your beautiful brown eyes or smirk in my life," Brooke smiled. "God, Sam, you could have died that night."</p>
<p>"So could you," Sam countered. "And I couldn't let that happen. Brooke grabbed Sam in a fierce hug.</p>
<p>"Don't ever take a stupid chance like that again," she ordered.</p>
<p>"I'll take that chance a million times over if it means you live," Sam said quietly. "Even if you didn't love me, I'd love you enough to die for you."</p>
<p>"Sammy?" Brooke sobbed. Sam placed her fingers over Brooke's lips to silence her.</p>
<p>"Shhh, it's over with. Done. Now, did you see your accident?" Brooke nodded. "What did you see?" Brooke smirked.</p>
<p>"A really big, scary tree that had no business being in my way, actually," she winked.</p>
