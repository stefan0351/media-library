<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Chapter Five -->

<p>"Brooke, I'm not asking you to reinstate her, just tell me why you booted her off the team," Sam asked as she was getting ready for bed later in the bathroom she shared with Brooke. Brooke sighed and shook her head.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to argue with you about this, Sam. Just leave it alone."</p>
<p>"Brooke, I can't. You know that the Glamazons are important to Nic. Why would you take that away from her?" Sam asked confused. "It's so unlike you."</p>
<p>&lt;Because she took what was important to me, Sam. I wish you could see that&gt;</p>
<p>"Because she was being uncooperative and disruptive. Not to mention the fact that she couldn't keep up with the rest of the squad. I can't let one person drag the rest of us under," Brooke explained. "We've worked too hard to have it all undone because she's not prepared or willing to work."</p>
<p>"OK," Sam nodded. "I can see your point. I just wanted to make sure it had nothing to do with me." Brooke smirked.</p>
<p>"Gee you've got an awfully high opinion of yourself lately," she said playfully. Sam smiled and shrugged.</p>
<p>"Nah. But I'm not stupid either. I see the way you two behave when I'm around. And the fact that your friendship went south when I started dating Nicole clues me in that there's a bigger issue here that you don't want to discuss. OK, fine, I can deal with that. Now, normally, watching you tear Nicole apart would be fun. But even if I wasn't seeing her in a romantic sense, the fact that something else is bothering you would take all the pleasure out of it for me."</p>
<p>"How can you call what you and Nicole do 'dating' anyway?" Brooke asked, switching subjects. Sam blinked at her momentarily confused.</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"I mean, let's be honest, Sam. Do you two even go out anymore? Or do you just stay in?" Sam scowled at her.</p>
<p>"That's really none of your business," she snapped. Brooke sighed again. She hadn't meant to say what she said, it just kind of tumbled out of her mouth as a way to stop Sam's stream of consciousness. And now she regretted it.</p>
<p>"Sam, I don't want to fight. You're right, it isn't my business. I'm sorry I said that. It was mean and crude. Really, I'm sorry," she apologized. Sam's face softened a bit.</p>
<p>"S'OK. Besides, I did taunt you with it. I should have expected some payback. Tell you what: I won't mention it if you don't, deal?" she asked with a grin. Brooke forced herself to smile back and nodded.</p>
<p>"Deal," she agreed. Desperate for another change in topic that was no where near Nicole Julian, Brooke switched gears again.</p>
<p>"Your birthday's coming up, Sam. Any idea what you want?" she asked as she put away her toothbrush. Sam stared at her in surprise. "What?" </p>
<p>"I didn't expect you to remember my birthday," Sam whispered. Brooke frowned.</p>
<p>"Why wouldn't I?" she questioned. Sam looked down and then away as she shrugged.</p>
<p>"I don't know. I guess I didn't think it was all that important to you," Sam answered quietly. Brooke did her best to ignore the flash of pain that raced through her at the statement.</p>
<p>&lt;How could she think she wasn't important to me?&gt; she wondered. &lt;Because you never told her she was, you idiot&gt; she sighed back.</p>
<p>"Sam, it IS important to me. It's your birthday, your special day. And if there's anything in particular that you want that I can get for you, let me know. I want to make it count," Brooke vowed. Sam stared at her with an expression of mixed wonder and appreciation.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Brooke. That means a lot. Sometimes I feel like I get lost in the shuffle with Carmen, Lily, and Harrison. Like my birthday isn't so important as long as I remember theirs. I know that sounds selfish but sometimes it hurts," Sam confessed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"You should tell them, Sammy. If they're hurting your feelings..." Brooke started. Sam laughed and shook her head.</p>
<p>"Not important," she cut Brooke off. "If I think of anything I want, I'll let you know," she finished heading to her room. "Good night, Brooke."</p>
<p>"Night Sam," Brooke answered as Sam left.</p>
<p>She didn't like the way the conversation had ended. The fact that Sam let the hurt caused by what was probably an innocent mistake on the part of Carmen, Lily and Harrison fester without saying anything bothered her. But then she figured who was she to talk since she was letting the hurt caused by seeing Sam with Nic grow and eat at her like a cancer. But the more she thought about the relationship Sam that had with Nicole, the more Brooke realized she would want something more. She wouldn't be happy with just 'fun'. She wanted all of Sam, not just part of her.</p>
<p>&lt;But Sam's never said that she had actual 'feelings' for Nic&gt; she thought logically. &lt;And if there really isn't any actual emotion for her to base the relationship in, maybe she wouldn't be all that averse to leaving Nicole. Maybe for me?&gt; She shut off the light and crawled into bed, a ray of hope making her heart feel lighter.</p>
<p>&lt;I'm going to have to fight Nicole for her&gt; Brooke decided with a grin. &lt;And I'll have to start by getting Sam the most kick ass birthday present ever. Only thing is, I have NO idea what that might be. Hmmm, I'll have to ask Mom or Lily. Maybe they'll know&gt; She drifted off to sleep, planning how she was going to whisk Sam away from Nicole's evil clutches.</p>
