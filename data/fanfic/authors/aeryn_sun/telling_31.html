<!-- Telling Series \ Section 7: Dad - What Goes Around Comes Around -->

<p>Mike and Jane were waiting for them when they walked in the door. Sam felt
like she was walking in front of the firing squad, all she needed was a
blindfold and a cigarette. Brooke tightened her hold on Sam's hand as their
parents greeted them. </p>
<p>"Sam, Brooke, how was your trip?" Jane asked, relieved and pleasantly
surprised at how healthy Brooke looked even if Sam did still look a little tired
around the edges. She figured no one else would really notice beside maybe
Brooke but Jane was her mother after all and mothers notice these things. Brooke
gave a dazzling smile, a smile not seen in a very long time and answered. </p>
<p>"Terrific, Mom. That cabin is beautiful. It's too bad you and Sammy sold it
because it'd be a great place to visit from time to time," she beamed. Jane
smiled back. </p>
<p>"Well, Bill probably wouldn't mind renting it out to us every once in a
while," Jane suggested. She loved the way Brooke's eyes lit up at the thought.
(Nice job, Sam) Jane thought. </p>
<p>"Hi, Dad," Brooke said, a little more subdued. Mike nodded. </p>
<p>"Welcome home, Pumpkin," he said quietly. "Sam," he nodded at her. </p>
<p>"Hi, Mike," Sam said slightly confused that Mike even acknowledged her as she
and Brooke hugged her mother hello. Brooke took the welcome from Mike as
positive and hugged him as well. </p>
<p>"You look good, Brooke," Mike commented. Brooke frowned for a second but it
faded as quickly as it appeared. </p>
<p>"Sam took really good care of me, Dad. She's become a pretty good cook," she
explained. Jane arched an eyebrow at Sam. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"Mom, Brian and Jess aren't great cooks," she pointed out. Jane nodded. </p>
<p>"I see. Well, it's still great to see you both looking so good," Jane
repeated Mike's comment. Both Sam and Brooke rolled their eyes. </p>
<p>"Did we miss anything good?" Sam asked to change the subject. </p>
<p>"Not really. Lily, Josh and Nicole have asked about you and you'll be
surprised to hear so have Harrison and Carmen," Jane informed them. Their eyes
got wide. </p>
<p>"No way!" Sam exclaimed. </p>
<p>"Nu-uh," Brooke said at the same time. Jane laughed. </p>
<p>"Apparently absence does make the heart grow fonder. They feel really bad
about they way they acted and want a chance to talk to you." Sam shot a look at
Brooke. </p>
<p>"Think we should make them sweat it out a while longer?" she asked. Brooke
nodded. </p>
<p>"Oh, definitely," she agreed. Mike cleared his throat and everyone looked at
him. </p>
<p>"I want to get a few things straight," Sam had to surpress the ironic giggle
that threatened to make itself known at his choice of words. Out of the corner
of her eye, she saw both Brooke and Jane trying, unsuccessfully to hide smirks.
It didn't help her to swallow the giggle and Mike glared at her. </p>
<p>"Jane and I had a very long talk and I don't want to lose either of you. I
care for you both but I am not OK with this relationship," he started. When he
saw all three mouths open to protest, he raised a hand to stop them. He was
dimly and guiltily aware that at least one of them flinched at the action. "I
just want to say that while I'm not OK with it, I won't try to put a stop to it
either. But there are rules while you live in this house. This is MY house. You
will live by MY rules. I don't want to see it, or hear it, understood?" Two
heads, one blonde, one brunette nodded. </p>
<p>"Now that doesn't mean that you can't hold hands or that sort of thing. I am
not an ogre, contrary to my past behavior. I'm just asking that you not flaunt
it in my face." </p>
<p>"Basically don't singe your eyebrows by flaming?" Sam asked trying to lighten
the mood. Brooke elbowed her in the ribs. Mike frowned at her for a second
before actually smiling. </p>
<p>"Yes, Sam, please don't set fire to the household furnishings," he attempted
to joke. Everyone smiled. "Welcome home." </p>

<p>Sam and Brooke returned to school the following Monday to a slew of questions
from Lily, Josh, and Nicole. They couldn't believe that Mike had welcomed them
home. </p>
<p>"It was bizzare but I guess Mom got through to him," Sam said as they stood
at the lockers. </p>
<p>"You look good, B," Nic commented. "Although if you ever pull that stunt
again, Spam is going to find herself a sudden widow," she warned. Brooke looked
suitably chagrined. </p>
<p>"Ah, the little lunchen meat without her Brooke, the horror," Sam sighed
dramatically while putting a hand to her forehead and pretending to faint. Nic
glared at her good-naturedly. </p>
<p>"Hi, Brooke, Hi Sam," Carmen said as she reached the locker. Five sets of
eyes, two blue, two brown, one hazel stared back at her silently. "Whoa, tough
crowd," she laughed nervously. Complete silence. "OK, would it help if I got
down on my knees and begged forgiveness?" </p>
<p>"Gee, I don't know, Carm, why don't you give it a try and we'll let you
know?" Nicole bit out. "And while you're down there, why don't you try licking
the scum off their shoes too since that's right about at the same level you are?
Actually, that's an insult to the scum." Brooke put her hand on Nicole's
shoulder to pull her back. It was like having your own rabid Versace clad
pitbull whose teeth were lined with sharp one-liners. </p>
<p>"Easy, Nic, let's hear her out," Brooke suggested getting raised eyebrows
from everyone including her girlfriend. "We owe her that much." </p>
<p>"Uhm, Brooke, we don't OWE her anything," Sam argued. "She went all militant
on US, remember?" Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"And I was wrong, Sam. Very wrong. I was just surprised is all," Carmen tried
to explain. </p>
<p>"It's been weeks, Carmen. What made you come around now? April Tuna finally
driving you mad?" Sam asked sarcastically. Carmen shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, I just realized that I missed you guys. I was wrong to act the way that
I did. I was only thinking about everyone else and not about the two of you and
I'm really sorry. And after you left I realized that I could really lose you
both over this if I didn't snap out of it." Carmen sighed. "I have nothing else
to say except that I'm sorry." Brooke looked at Sam who shrugged. </p>
<p>"It's not much, but it's a start," Brooke admitted. </p>
<p>"And we're not just going to forgive you overnight, Carm. You hurt us pretty
bad. But, I guess we can try," Sam paused and scanned the hallway. "Where's
Harrison? Mom said he'd called too." </p>
<p>"Hiding somewhere. He's avoiding you because he's afraid you'll lynch him on
sight." Sam snickered. </p>
<p>"Smart boy," she sneered. Brooke pinched her lightly. "Ow!" Brooke turned to
Carmen. </p>
<p>"Tell him that if he feels the same way you do to come and see us. We'll give
him the same deal. He just has to ask first." Sam stared at her incredulously.
</p>
<p>"Speak for yourself, Princess. He said some pretty mean stuff and I'm not
sure after that that I want him as a friend," she said bitterly. Brooke sighed.
She knew Sam had been hurt by Harrison's words but was disappointed that she
wouldn't let it go. </p>
<p>"You forgave her for turning you into a hood ornament," Brooke countered,
pointing at Nicole who paled and rolled her eyes. Sam gave her a sympathetic
look. "Why can't you forgive Harrison for what was essentially a normal reaction
for him?" Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"Argh, fine, alright, if he comes and gives an appropriate apology, I'll
THINK about it, OK?" Sam huffed. Brooke smiled, knowing that she won. Sam glared
at the smile. </p>
<p>"Thank you Sammy," she hugged Sam quickly so that no one outside their group
of friends would see. </p>
<p>"Yeah, sure whatever," Sam mumbled. "Can we like go to class and like, do the
learning thing now?" she asked impatiently. Everyone smiled. </p>
<p>"Spam, you are sooooo whipped," Nicole quipped. </p>
