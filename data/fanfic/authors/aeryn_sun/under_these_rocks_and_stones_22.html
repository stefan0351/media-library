<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Stealing Time -->

<p>Sam sat quietly on the park bench, her notebook and sketch pad lying idle beside her. She just wasn't feeling creative. Her mother and Terri had finally convinced her to go outside for some fresh air and she'd complied, if only to get out from under their watchful eyes. She knew that they were only concerned about her but their constant overprotectiveness was wearing thin on her nerves. Nothing they did or said helped to make her feel better or reunite her with Brooke. And that was all she really wanted.</p>
<p>She had started by trying to write something, anything to get her mind off the situation. But all she'd ended up writing were letters to Brooke and that only made her miss the blonde more. So she tried to sketch her surroundings at the park but quickly lost interest. She did, however, manage to finish two sketches of Brooke. So she gave that up too. So now she sat with her earphones on trying not to cry.</p>
<p>Her ribs were still tender, her split lip was still purple and stung, and the hairline fracture they'd discovered in her cheekbone sometimes throbbed. But none of it meant anything to her. She didn't even bother to hate Mike for beating her. She did, however, despise him for trying to hurt her mother and Brooke. That was inexcusable in her opinion. She would have never believed that Mike would go so far but experience had sadly taught her otherwise. It made Sam wonder, in the back of her mind, if Mike had ever abused Brooke growing up. The mere thought made her blood boil But she hoped Brooke would have trusted her enough after all this time to have told her if he had.</p>
<p>She was broken from her thoughts by a gentle tug on her earphones. She followed the familiar hand on her shoulder to its owners face and saw Brooke smiling sweetly at her.</p>
<p>"You look so beautiful sitting there," Brooke whispered. "But so sad." Sam stared at her as tears sprung to her eyes.</p>
<p>"I miss you so much," Sam sobbed leaping up into Brooke's open and waiting arms. Brooke wrapped her arms tightly around Sam and tried to calm her.</p>
<p>"I miss you too, Sammy," she told the crying brunette. "So much so it hurts." She brought her lips to Sam's and poured all her love, longing, and need into the embrace. Sam relaxed into her and slowly stopped crying.</p>
<p>"How did you find me?" Sam asked through her sniffles as Brooke sat them both down on the bench.</p>
<p>"Aunt Terri knew where you were. Dad won't let me have my car because he knows I'll take off again," Brooke explained with a ruefull laugh. "And since he's working late, Terri picked me up at school. She's really worried about you and she knew that you needed to see me. I can't stay long, but I'm here," Sam burrowed herself into Brooke's side.</p>
<p>"I love you," Sam said softly. "In case I didn't say it enough." Brooke hugged her again.</p>
<p>"I love you too, Sammy," she responded. She pulled away slightly to get a better look at her love. Sam was bruised and pale, her normally luminous brown eyes were dull and rimmed in red. She was obviously not coping well.</p>
<p>"How are you doing, baby?" Brooke asked gently. Sam sighed.</p>
<p>"'M OK," she mumbled.</p>
<p>"Liar," Brooke teased lightly. "Talk to me, Sammy. Your letters tell me otherwise." Sam shifted slightly before settling down in Brooke's lap.</p>
<p>"I'm lost. I don't know what to do," Sam admitted. "I'm trying but I can't find a way to put things back the way they were. I don't know how to fix this awful mess."</p>
<p>"Sammy," Brooke started softly. "It isn't your responsibility to fix all this. It isn't your fault and you need to realize that."</p>
<p>"But..." Sam began to protest. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"No Sam," Brooke broke in. "It's not your fault. The only thing you did was love me. You didn't make me love you back. You didn't make Lily and Nic fall for each other. And you didn't make my Dad an abusive, homophobic asshole." She paused as the image of Mike beating Sam flashed through her mind and she shuddered.</p>
<p>"I am SO sorry he hurt you," she apologized near tears.</p>
<p>"Not your fault, Brooke," Sam assured her as she stroked some blonde hair away from Brooke's eyes.</p>
<p>"I shouldn't have let him hurt you," Brooke explained.</p>
<p>"You didn't let him do anything. I was defending you and Mom and well, shit happens," Sam told her.</p>
<p>"I still can't believe that was my father," Brooke sighed. Sam stared directly into Brooke's remorseful hazel eyes.</p>
<p>"He never...did he...growing up was he..." Sam stumbled. Brooke knew what she was trying to ask and shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, he wasn't, I swear," she promised Sam who let out a relieved breath. "I've never known him to be violent, Sam. Loud on occasion when he was really angry but he never hit me."</p>
<p>"Thank God," Sam breathed. She hated the thought of Brooke suffering like that. "And thank God Mom's not going to marry him."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know," Brooke agreed.</p>
<p>"Brooke, time to go," Terri walked up behind them. "You know your father is going to call the house to make sure you're there. And if you're not..." she let the statement hang. Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"OK. I know," she sighed. "That man missed his calling as a stalker," she muttered. She looked back into Sam's face.</p>
<p>"I have to go now, love," she said quietly as tears fell down both their faces. "But I'll make sure that we see each other again soon. Only for much longer next time." Brooke kissed Sam deeply to seal the promise.</p>
<p>"'kay," Sam whispered not wanting to let Brooke go but knowing that she had to. "I love you."</p>
<p>"I love you too, Sam. With all my heart and soul."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Lily smiled. She had spoken to Brooke during English class and was beyond happy to hear that the cheerleader had had the chance to see and talk to Sam. Brooke even looked a little better than she had in recent days. A little bit of her shine and energy had returned.</p>
<p>(Now) Lily thought. (If I could only talk to Niki)</p>
<p>But an ocean and a few thousand miles seperated her from her blonde lover. It was going to take more than a helpful aunt to make Lily's dream come true.</p>
<p>"Hey, Lil' Lily," Mary Cherry chirped, plunking herself right down next to Lily in the lunchroom. A move that was odd in itself but make stranger by the fact that Mary Cherry was talking to her politely.</p>
<p>"Mary Cherry," Lily responded rolling her eyes. She really wasn't in the mood for a go-round with the off-balance and flighty Texan at the moment.</p>
<p>"Jus' cawl me yer lil' ol' Fairy Godmother, y'all," Mary Cherry continued excitedly. "Cuz thanks ta me an' mah superior brilliance an' dasterdly underhandedness (courtesy of Nic's trainin' o' course) Ah have th' solution to yer heartfelt an' soap opera worthy problems." Lily sighed. She felt a migraine coming on fast.</p>
<p>"What are you babbling about, Mary Cherry?"</p>
<p>"Ah'm sayin' that thanks tah me an' my quick thinkin', you will no longer haf ta pine away fer yer lady love-locked away in a tower fah fah away from yer warm and ample bossom," Mary Cherry explained.</p>
<p>"You just like to talk to hear yourself, don't you?" Lily asked sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Not even yoah sour mood, cause no doubt, by a lack of your illicit carnal adventures..."</p>
<p>"Mary Cherry!" Lily hissed. "Your point?" Mary Cherry smirked.</p>
<p>"Thanks tah me, Mama's platinum card and those oh-so-intellegent and sexy mens at Cingular Wireless, you now have a di-rect line to yer long-lost, convent bound lover." Mary Cherry whipped out a brand new cell phone with an electric blue case decorated with lightening bolts and handed it to Lily.</p>
<p>"What?" Lily asked confused.</p>
<p>"Nic cawled me an' asked me ta git this fer ya. Only she has th' number to it and the number for her at that Hell-Spawn school she's at is awlready programmed into it. Y'all may still be seperated by miles, Lil' Lily, but now ya cin reach out and touch someone."</p>
<p>Lily, despite her personal aversion to and dislike for the wacky Texan, engulfed Mary Cherry in a huge hug.</p>
<p>"Thank you SO much, Mary Cherry!" she squealed in delight. "What can I do to repay you for this?"</p>
<p>"Yer welcome, Lil' Lily. Ah did the favor fer Nic so no need tah repay me. She's the one ya ought ta repay. 'Sides, Ah don't swing that way," Mary Cherry laughed and walked away. Lily shook her head and turned on the phone. It almost immediately rang.</p>
<p>"Hello?" Lily said warily into the phone. She was still a tad suspicious of Mary Cherry.</p>
<p>"Whatcha wearing there, Hot Stuff?" Nicole's voice drawled back. Lily laughed in relief and joy.</p>
<p>"Niki," she breathed happily.</p>
<p>"Satan herself," Nic joked lightly. "I miss you, Lil," she added softly.</p>
<p>"I miss you too. This is a terrific idea," Lily pointed out. She heard Nicole laugh.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I'm surprised Hayseed got it right, though. I wonder about her sometimes."</p>
<p>"Me too," Lily cradled the phone gently. "How are you doing?" Nicole sighed.</p>
<p>"Switzerland is nice, but I wish I was with you," she said softly. "The school's not so bad, especially since I'm practically running the place."</p>
<p>"Finally the queen of your domain, huh?" Lily teased. Nicole let out a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>"You could say that. It's nice but..." she paused for a second and Lily thought the phone had cut off.</p>
<p>"The price is too high, Lily. Even for finally having what I thought it was I wanted. Now that I have it, I realize that it doesn't mean jack shit. All I want, all I need is you, Lily. Not some stupid label. You make me happy. This stupid game of social chess doesn't."</p>
<p>"Aw, Nic," Lily sighed. "That means a lot to me."</p>
<p>"I knew it would, Lil. And it's the truth. I mean, after high school, what good is a stupid 'popular' label going to do me? It's not like I can change it in for instant credit," Nicole explained. "Especially when all I want in my life, my future is you." Lily felt the tears rolling down her face but ignored him.</p>
<p>"I love you," she wept.</p>
<p>"Love you too, Angel. Don't cry," Nicole implored. "It'll give you crow's feet," she joked. Lily giggled.</p>
<p>You'd still love me, right?" she asked through her giggles. Of that, she really had no doubt.</p>
<p>"Of course," Nic assured her. "Besides, I know a fantastic plastic surgeon."</p>
<p>"Oh, you're funny," Lily chided loving the familiarity of the much missed banter she shared with Nicole.</p>
<p>"Any ideas on how you'll get home? You promised that you'd be back," Lily reminded her. Nicole thought a minute.</p>
<p>"I'm working on it," she said cryptically and Lily could hear the smile in Nic's voice. She knew that if it was humanly possible, Nicole would find a way. Nothing could stop Nicole once she set her mind to something.</p>
<p>"OK."</p>
<p>"So, you OK, Lil?" Nic asked lovingly.</p>
<p>"Not without you here but I'm hanging in," she said.</p>
<p>"You keep doing that and I'll be home before you know it," Nicole promised. "How are Spam and Brooke?" Lily sighed.</p>
<p>"That bad?" Nic asked after hearing the sigh.</p>
<p>"Brooke's OK. Her Dad is being a total Nazi though. She can't do anything without his direct permission," Lily informed her blonde lover.</p>
<p>"Jesus, that man is a prize," Nicole growled. "I still can't believe he went after Sam like that."</p>
<p>"Me either," Lily concurred. It still gave her chills to think about. "She's not doing too well from what I hear."</p>
<p>"Damn, I was afraid she wouldn't hold up well," Nicole swore.</p>
<p>"Niki, she's doing the best she can under the circumstances," Lily defended Sam.</p>
<p>"I know, Lil. I didn't mean anything bad. I just meant that she was bound to break eventually. She was so stressed," she clarified to Lily.</p>
<p>"Yeah, you're right. Brooke snuck a visit to her yesterday and I guess Sam is really out of it. And still feeling guilty about the whole thing. I just don't understand why she feels so responsible. It doesn't make sense."</p>
<p>"It does if you're Spam. Someone has to take the blame and since Mike is so fond of blaming her, she does too. But, we'll work on helping her see that it's not her fault and put the blame where it belongs, on Mike, when I get home," Nic said firmly. Lily smiled.</p>
<p>"Careful, Nic. You almost sound like you care about Sam," she teased.</p>
<p>"God forbid!" Nic gasped dramatically. "I'm just concerned about her for Brooke's sake. That's all."</p>
<p>"Sure, Niki, sure," Lily laughed. "You keep telling yourself that."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Jane watched as Sam tossed fitfully on her bed. She was asleep but obviously haunted by something. Every whimper and mumbled cry for Brooke broke Jane's heart a little more.</p>
<p>"I'm so worried about her," she sighed to Terri as they drank a late night cup of coffee.</p>
<p>"I know you are, Jane. We all are. But the visit with Brooke seems to have done her some good. At least she's sleeping some," Terri replied.</p>
<p>"I guess. But I haven't seen her this upset since Joe died. She still carries that with her. It's an awful lot for such a young set of shoulders to bear."</p>
<p>"She's a tough kid, though. Especially given the way she stood up to Mike when he tried to hurt you and Brooke. That took guts. You have to remember that and have faith in her to handle this. Help her if she needs it, yes, but trust her to work through it," Terri advised. Jane just sighed again.</p>
<p>"Look, Brooke loves her desperately. She will be there for her and won't let her go, despite her father. Believe that," Terri tried again to reassure her friend.</p>
<p>"Thanks Terri," Jane said with a slight smile. "I can't thank you enough for all your help. I'm really glad you're here to help the girls." Terri smiled.</p>
<p>"You're welcome. There's no where I'd rather be if Pumpkin-nose needs me. You and Sam too, Jane. I'm here if you need anything," Terri reminded her softly.</p>
<p>"I know. You've been terrific throughout this whole thing. I guess Brooke got her kind and compassionate nature from your side of the family," Jane said. Terri laughed quietly.</p>
<p>"Well, she obviously didn't get it from Mike," she grumbled.</p>
<p>"I never knew he got that angry. We always got along so well. And now we have Mac together...It's just unbelievable," Jane rambled.</p>
<p>"You know, as much as I always disliked the man, I never thought he'd go that far. I'm glad Kelly got away when she did. I only wish she'd taken Brooke with her," Terri lamented.</p>
<p>"I really loved him. Or at least thought I did," Jane said regretfully.</p>
<p>"He could be charming and likeable when he wanted, Jane," Terri said, covering Jane's hand with her own in a show of support. "But he wasn't right for you. From what I know of you, and Sam, you deserve better. Don't worry, eventually the right person will come along."</p>
<p>"I hope so. It's going to be tough raising Mac on my own. I mean, I did it after Joe died and Sam was young, but it was hard," Jane sighed.</p>
<p>"But you're not alone, Jane. You have Sam and Brooke. Mac is their baby sister. You know they'll do what they can to help. And you've got your friends, including me. Whatever you need, just ask," Terri told her. Jane smiled.</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
