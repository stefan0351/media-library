<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Seven -->

<p>A week passed with Brooke coming no closer to regaining her memory than she was when she first woke up. She was positive of a few new things though: </p>
<p>1) Mac was the most adorable baby
<br>2) She fell more in love with Sam with each passing second
<br>3) She REALLY had to ditch Harrison</p>
<p>He was a nice guy, really he was and that was part of what was bothering her. He was TOO nice, TOO bland, TOO sweet. He was BORING. He was more of a brother type than the boyfriend type. He was concerned about her and tried to be patient but he was being too pushy with his 'do you remember this' and 'do you remember that' routine. He was driving her nuts in the 'I'll end up in a padded cell in Bellevue on Thorazine' sense. He wanted more from Brooke than she was willing to give him. She doubted at any point she'd ever be ready or willing to have that kind of relationship with Harrison. Especially since her more lurid dreams involving chocolate body paint had a decidedly different participant. Sam. </p>
<p>She giggled at that last thought as Mac resettled in her arms with her bottle. </p>
<p>(Well, I don't know much about myself but I apparently have a very vivid imagination) she snorted. </p>
<p>"And a very dirty mind," she added quietly to Mac who studied her silently while enjoying her bottle. </p>
<p>"Did you know Mac that your sister Sam is the most breathtaking creature I have ever seen?" she asked playfully. Mac stared at her and seemed to arch one dark brow in response. Brooke examined the features of the dark haired, light eyed baby in her arms. So far, Mac seemed to be an odd mix of Brooke and Sam themselves. She had high cheekbones, a cute perky nose, full lips, large expressive eyes that changed colors and were framed by long lush lashes. Her hair was light brown and slightly wavy. She had a dimple in her left cheek and a cleft in her chin that made her irresistibly adorable. </p>
<p>"If you're really lucky, when you grow up you'll look a lot like Sammy," Brooke told her. Mac removed her lips from the bottle, scrunched her nose and burped, loudly. Brooke burst out laughing. </p>
<p>"Is that your commentary on that?" she asked as Mac sighed and reached for the bottle again. Brooke placed it back in Mac's mouth and continued to talk to the baby as she ate. </p>
<p>"You could do a lot worse, you know. I can tell you all ready have the same mischievous sparkle in your eyes that she does. You're going to be stubborn, like she is. I hope you're as caring, compassionate and loving an individual as she is too." She ran a hand through the baby's soft fine hair. </p>
<p>"What on Earth am I going to do, Mac? I'm falling hopelessly for Sam but I still have to ditch Harrison. God, he's a brick," she sighed. Mac seemed to nod even with the bottle in her mouth. </p>
<p>"What am I supposed to do now?" she asked. Mac rolled her eyes almost in response. It led Brooke to wonder exactly how much the baby actually understood of what she was saying. </p>
<p>"Let me know when she finally starts answering you," Sam said with a wide smile as she entered the room and handed Brooke a can of Pepsi. </p>
<p>"I will," Brooke laughed. Sam sat down in the armchair. </p>
<p>"Good, because I'm kinda curious as to what goes on in her head sometimes," she joked. Brooke nodded as Mad kind of smirked at her. It made Brooke rather nervous. </p>
<p>"Heh, so am I," she said more to Mac than Sam. </p>
<p>"So, what are your plans for this evening?" Sam asked as she flipped through the channels on the TV. </p>
<p>"Date with Harrison," Brooke answered disgustedly. Mac burped again. "Very funny baby." </p>
<p>"Don't sound so excited, you might sprain yourself," Sam teased. Brooke snickered as she rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"I hope Mac doesn't inherit your 'wonderful' sense of humor," she joked. Sam stuck out her tongue and went back to watching 'Iron Chef'. Brooke watched her quietly for a few minutes. </p>
<p>"Sam," she started slowly, "I'm going to call it off with Harrison tonight." Sam jumped in mild surprise and shut off the TV before turning in her seat to face the blonde. </p>
<p>"OK, mind if I ask why?" she asked. Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"It's not working out, you know? He's nice and all but I don't want to date him." Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"He's going to blame the accident and memory loss, you know," she pointed out logically. </p>
<p>"Let him," Brooke shrugged again. "It's not going to change anything. What is, is. I feel nothing for him except an obligation to be his friend based solely on who I used to be. As a matter of fact, I find him about as interesting as an MRI scan." </p>
<p>"You've had a lot of those lately," Sam smiled. </p>
<p>"And like MRIs, I've had enough of Harrison to last me a lifetime. The idea of facing either if them makes me cringe," Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"Ouch," Sam groaned. "That's harsh." She watched as Brooke rolled her eyes boredly for a second and then started to play with Mac. "You really don't feel anything for him, do you?" she asked genuinely surprised. Brooke switched Mac to her other arm before responding. </p>
<p>"No, no I don't," she said plainly. "I honestly doubt I ever really did. And if I did, it's over now. Like I said, he's a nice guy, Sam. But he's really not my type." </p>
<p>"Oh," Sam managed to say sounding slightly confused. Brooke watched as a slight frown creased Sam's forehead. </p>
<p>"If you're interested in him, Sam, go for it. I don't care," she encouraged more for Sam's reaction than anything else. Sam's frown deepened for a second before she locked eyes with Brooke and graced her with an enigmatic smile. </p>
<p>"Thanks but given the state of my relationship with Harrison, I doubt it'd work for one. Two, he really isn't my type either," she said through the widening grin. Brooke smiled back as an unexpected but pleasant feeling of happiness spread through her. She eyed Sam carefully. </p>
<p>"So what exactly IS your type?" she teased adding a hint of flirt to her tone. Sam's eyes widened at the underlying tones but her smile didn't waver. </p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know," she said as she pretended to be deep in thought. "Someone with more depth, for starters. Harrison has all the depth of a kiddie pool." Brooke started laughing as Mac gurgled and clapped happily. </p>
<p>"So true," Brooke agreed between giggles. Seeing that she had a captive audience and loving to make Brooke laugh, Sam continued. </p>
<p>"I'd like someone intellegent too. Not that Harrison is stupid. Neither was George but I'd like to be able to have a conversation with someone without having to break down my ten dollar words into fifty cent pieces." </p>
<p>"And still get change back?" Brooke snickered. Sam laughed. </p>
<p>"Exactly. Harrison puts his two cents in and I feel obligated to give him change," she joked. Boy, they were ripping the poor guy to shreads. </p>
<p>"What else?" Brooke prompted. She was enjoying this unguarded view into who Sam was. </p>
<p>"Uh, well, pardon me for being vain but I'd kind of like someone good looking. Harrison's cute, in the 'I'm a lost puppy, please give me a good home' sort of way." By now Brooke was lying on the couch laughing while balancing a gleeful Mac on her chest. She was laughing so hard her ribs hurt. </p>
<p>"Oh God," Brooke gasped as Mac bounced happily. Sam smirked at the two. They really were quite cute. </p>
<p>"And they have to be kind, sensitive, compassionate," Sam continued. "And good in bed..." she added cheekily. </p>
<p>"SAM!" Brooke chastized as she laughed. She was also blushing as Sam smiled sheepishly. </p>
<p>"Sorry," Sam said although she managed to somehow sound not the least bit apologetic. </p>
<p>"I bet. Samantha McPherson, exactly what are you teaching our baby sister?" Brooke asked lightly as she mockingly covered Mac's ears. Mac blinked in mild confusion and then covered Brooke's hands with her own thinking it was a new game. Sam smirked devilishly as she arched an eyebrow. </p>
<p>"The important stuff?" she half answered, half asked. Brooke rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh you, you're horrible," Brooke decided with a giggle. Sam nodded and stuck out her tongue. </p>
<p>"Yup," she agreed as she turned the TV back on. Brooke said nothing but just sat and watched as Sam sat looking satisfied with herself. She had noticed that Sam had never clarified whether or not her 'type' was a he or a she and it gave her hope. </p>
<p>"I've been trumped somehow here, haven't I?" Brooke asked as she stood up with Mac. </p>
<p>"Yup," Sam answered while sipping her soda. Brooke chuckled. </p>
<p>"Fine. I'm going to change Mac and put her down for her nap. Then I have to get ready for the execution," she announced. </p>
<p>"Heh, yours or Harrison's?" Sam asked. Brooke tilted her head as she thought.</p>
<p>"Both," she replied. </p>
<p>"I'll say something nice in your eulogy!" Sam called after her as Brooke went up the stairs. </p>
<p>"Gee, thanks," Brooke snorted back at her as she left. </p>
