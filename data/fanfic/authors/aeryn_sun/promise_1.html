<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Prologue -->

<p>Brooke was livid. She was beyond livid. She was close to being in a murderous rage. She didn't know what to do with herself or what to do about how she felt. All she did know was that there was one person who she wanted to wrap her hands around the throat of and squeeze. She wanted to make her hurt as bad as she was hurting right now. And if Brooke had her way, she was going to find a way to make Nicole Julian suffer.</p>
<p>It had started about two months ago. To the shock of everyone, Sam had quietly announced at a family dinner that she was gay. No dramatics, no fanfare or build up, just a quiet admission of who she was. She wasn't looking for permission or anything; she was just being honest. And Brooke was blown away by the strength it must have taken for Sam to do such a thing. Jane admitted that she had her suspicions for a while and while she was still stunned, she was going to be OK with it. Mike was shocked and surprised, which wasn't surprising to Brooke. Her father was so oblivious sometimes that she swore he wouldn't know the sky was blue unless you informed him. And Brooke, well, she was elated.</p>
<p>For quite a while, Brooke was aware that her feelings for Sam were less than friendly or sisterly. They bordered on the downright impure. She was captivated by everything that was Sam. From the other girl's hair to her eyes, lips and scent, she wanted Sam in everyway. Brooke knew she was bisexual if not gay herself but had never been brave enough to tell anyone. Anyone but her best friend Nicole, that is.</p>
<p>She had haltingly confessed her feelings for Sam to Nicole a while before Sam came out after Nic caught her ogling the brunette in gym class. Nicole had confronted her about the 'fuck me please' looks she was shooting Sam and Brooke crumbled. She told Nic about how she felt for Sam. How the journalist's mere presence turned her knees to jelly, her stomach flip-flopped and her heart raced. She told of the detailed and vivid dreams where she made love to Sam repeatedly, trusting her best friend not to betray her with the information. And while Nicole never told another soul, Brooke knew that she should have expected Nicole to use the information against her eventually.</p>
<p>After Sam came out to the family, she also told her friends. She had no intention of hiding herself. It spread through the school like wildfire but Sam paid no attention to the whispers and slurs. She was who she was and the Hell with what anyone thought. Again Brooke was in awe of the girl and her inner strength. She stood by Sam's side through it, knowingly jeopardizing her 'popular' label but not caring. Sam was more important to her. And eventually, probably because the queen of the school was standing beside her supporting her, the rumors and harassment died down. Brooke was hoping that eventually she'd work up the nerve to tell Sam how she felt. She was almost there too. Sam was really appreciative of her support and they'd grown closer because of it. But just as Brooke started to work up the nerve, Nicole got in her way.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Oh mah Gawd, Brookie, did ya hear th' latest?" Mary Cherry asked at lunch two weeks earlier. Brooke sighed into her salad and braced herself for another onslaught of the Southerner's personal brand of 'Not Necessarily the News'.</p>
<p>"No, Mary Cherry, I haven't. What's up?" she asked boredly while scanning the lunchroom for Sam. She had hardly seen her all day and was missing her.</p>
<p>"Seems ouah very own Miz Julian has switched to the Sapphic side!" Mary Cherry exclaimed barely in control of her facilities. Brooke's head snapped around so fast Mary Cherry could have sworn she heard it pop.</p>
<p>"WHAT?" Brooke nearly screamed. She had a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach. She just KNEW where this was going and it was making her sick. Mary Cherry nodded.</p>
<p>"Uh-huh. Seems Nic's bin holdin' out on us. She's a muffdiver," Mary Cherry said conspirally. </p>
<p>"Speak English please. Where did you hear this?" Brooke demanded to know. Mary Cherry beamed. She loved being the center of attention and having all the information to hold over other people. She felt SO important.</p>
<p>"Straight from th' horse's mouth, if y'all will pardon th' pun," she responded. "Nic tol' me las' night tha' she's got herself a giiiiiiiiirlfrieand."</p>
<p>"Oh Jesus," Brooke mumbled. She turned back to Mary Cherry. "Who?"</p>
<p>"That's th' serprizin' part! Wuld ya bulieve Spammy McFearsome?" Brooke stood up and ran to the bathroom, unable to stand hearing the news.</p>
<p>"Ah know! Disgustin', ain't it?" Mary Cherry called after her.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>From that point on Brooke anger and hurt continued to grow. When she confronted Nic about it, Nicole simply told her that she was taking advantage of the opportunity put before her. Sam was a hottie and she'd have to be a fool to pass that up. Brooke had waited too long to act, that wasn't her fault. She told Brooke that maybe if the taller blonde had a backbone and had gone after what she wanted, she'd know what a great kisser Sam was instead of Nicole. And Nicole gloated that she couldn't wait to feel Sam's passion in between the sheets. Brooke hauled off and slapped her for that comment and Nicole had only smiled at her. It was then that Brooke realized Nicole's true motivation. She was going to use Brooke's feelings for Sam to destroy her, possibly destroy Brooke and Sam both. But Brooke wasn't going to let that happen. And thus the war inside the popular clique began.</p>
