<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Thirteen -->

<p>"Are you sure you're ready for this?" Mike asked for the one
thousandth time as Brooke and Sam prepared to leave for the first day of their
senior year. Sam let out a disgusted huff and left the kitchen as Brooke turned
to face her father. </p>
<p>"Will you PLEASE stop asking me that? I have to go back
eventually and the first day is as good as any," she informed him. She put her
hands on her hips and tilted her head slightly. </p>
<p>"Unless of course you're ashamed of the 'new' Brooke and want
to lock me in the house until, when, or if my memory returns," she challenged.
Mike's eyes grew wide and he put his hands up in defense. </p>
<p>"I'd never be ashamed of you, Brooke. I just want to make sure
that you don't take on too much at once," he explained hastily. Brooke sighed at
him. </p>
<p>"Whatever," she said boredly. It wasn't that she didn't like
or care for Mike, because she did. It was that he was so overbearing that he
made her want to scream. </p>
<p>"Dad," she said a little more patiently. "I can either do this
now, when I want to or later. Either way it's not going to be any easier however
I do it. PLease, let me do this my way and if it's too much I'll take a step
back. I promise." Mike nodded reluctantly. </p>
<p>"As long as you're sure you're ready, Sweetie. And don't be
afraid to ask for help if you need it," he advised gathering her into a tight
hug. Brooke returned the hug as best she could. She was getting used to Mike so
showing affection towards him was getting easier. </p>
<p>"I will. Besides, I have Sammy," she declared happily as she
watched Sam pad around the living room grabbing the last of her school gear.
While it was true in theory, she did have Sam, Sam had been acting a bit odd
towards her for the last few days. Everytime Brooke tried to get close to her
Sam would retreat both physically and emotionally. If Brooke crawled into bed
with her and fell asleep, she'd wake to find Sam asleep on the floor with a
blanket and pillow. Sam's excuse for that was usually pretty lame; leg cramps or
nightmares and not wanting to disturb Brooke. She was still there if Brooke
needed her but she was back to being closed off and guarded. Brooke mentally
kicked herself for the 100th time for her actions the night of her headache. Sam
had pulled away and shut down after that and Brooke blamed herself. </p>
<p>But she was confused. All the signals that she had gotten from
Sam prior to that night told her that Sam had feelings for her. But not it was
like she'd read it wrong and Sam was hurt or disgusted. Brooke couldn't figure
it out. The kiss had been gentle, the barest brushing of their lips. While it
had been highly enjoyable, it hadn't been a fire and passion filled embrace. She
didn't get why Sam was acting so skittish about it. If all else failed, Sam
could have brushed it off as pain induced or a gentle 'thank you'. But she
hadn't and it was obvious to Brooke that it was bothering the brunette.
</p>
<p>"You ready to go, Brooke?" Sam asked poking her head into the
kitchen. Brooke shook herself from her thoughts and nodded. </p>
<p>"As I'll ever be, Sammy. Let's go." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The ride to school was quiet for the most part until Brooke
couldn't stand the silence anymore. </p>
<p>"I'm really sorry, Sammy," she apologized quietly. Sam arched
an eyebrow at her as she drove the car. </p>
<p>"For?" she prompted. Brooke rolled her eyes. She knew that Sam
was aware of what she meant and was only playing dumb. </p>
<p>(There's her stubborn streak again. If it's something she
doesn't want to face she either runs away or ignores it) </p>
<p>"The other night," Brooke clarified. "When I crawled into your
bed with my migraine." </p>
<p>"Don't worry about it. You were scared and hurting and wanted
company. Anytime," Sam chirped still avoiding the real issue. </p>
<p>"Sam, I never should have kissed you. I'm sorry," Brooke
blurted out, slightly annoyed by Sam's delaying tactics. She heard Sam sigh
heavily. </p>
<p>"Whatever," Sam shrugged. "Don't worry about it." Her tone was
flat, almost hurt and it surprised Brooke. </p>
<p>"I just mean that I was out of line. I abused your trust in me
and for that I'm really sorry," she continued while staring at Sam's profile.
Sam frowned. </p>
<p>"I said 'Don't worry about it', so don't," she repeated. </p>
<p>"But Sam, you've been acting different since then and I can't
help thinking that it's my fault for what I did. I want things to go back to how
they were," Brooke pleaded. </p>
<p>"How am I different, Brooke? Because I sleep on the floor?"
Sam asked a little hotly. "I told you why I was doing that." </p>
<p>"And it was bullshit, Sam. We both know that. Since the kiss
you won't let me near you and I want to understand why," Brooke responded in the
same tone. </p>
<p>"There's nothing to understand, Brooke. I've had some stuff on
my mind. I'm sorry if I haven't been at your beck and call," she said snidely.
Brooke gasped at the pain in her chest caused by Sam's words. She really didn't
want to fight with Sam and didn't understand why Sam was reacting like she was. </p>
<p>"You don't have to be at my 'beck and call', Sammy. You're not
my slave," Brooke pointed out unable to keep the hurt she was feeling from
coming through in her voice. "I just want you to stop treating me like you hate
me." </p>
<p>Sam gasped. She hadn't realized that distancing herself from
Brooke would be interpreted by the blonde as hate. She was just trying to
protest them both from what she saw as a bad situation. Sam was bound and
determined not to let Brooke that close again, it was too dangerous to her
emotions. She wasn't sure that if things got that close again she'd be able to
put the brakes on before it got out of hand. And as much as she cared for
Brooke, she wasn't going to take advantage of the other girls situation.
</p>
<p>"Oh Brooke, I don't hate you," Sam confessed quietly. "I never
could. I just...I can't...I've just got a lot on my mind and I'm sorry if it
seems like I'm taking it out on you. I never meant to." She heard the rush of
air leave Brooke's mouth as she finished speaking and looked over to see the
lanky blonde crying quietly. </p>
<p>"Aw, don't cry. I'm sorry," Sam apologized feeling terrible. </p>
<p>"No, it's not you," Brooke sniffled. "I'm just really glad
that you don't hate me." </p>
<p>"No, and I never meant to give that impression," Sam told her.
Brooke gave her a watery smile. </p>
<p>"Thanks," she said. "You know that you can talk to me about
whatever's on your mind, right Sam?" </p>
<p>Sam sighed. This was one thing she was pretty sure she
COULDN'T discuss with Brooke. </p>
<p>(Why, yes, Brooke, by the way...I've fallen head over heels in
love with you in an incredibly unsisterly way. I think it'd be in both our
interests, unless you're interested in getting horizontal with me, if we didn't
spend quite so much time together. Or slept in the same bed. I have a Hell of a
time keeping my hands off of you. Somehow, I don't think it's what you wanna
hear, Brooke) Sam said to herself. </p>
<p>"Yeah, I know," she said out loud. "Don't worry about it
though. Eventually whatever it is will work itself out," she told Brooke trying
to sound convincing. </p>
<p>"OK, Sam," Brooke replied disappointed. "Just so long as you
know I'm here." </p>
<p>"I know." </p>
