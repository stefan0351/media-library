<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Twenty -->

<p>"You think he's right, don't you?" Brooke asked later that night. Sam yawned and crawled into bed as the blonde slipped into her night clothes.</p>
<p>"Yes and no," Sam responded sleepily. She was for some reason exhausted and could barely keep her eyes open. She figured that it had to do with the stress of the day and worrying over Brooke. At any rate, she wasn't in any condition for a heavy conversation.</p>
<p>"What do you mean `yes and no'?" Brooke huffed. Sam sighed and curled up on her stomach. She really only wanted to go to sleep.</p>
<p>"I dunno, Brooke," she mumbled as sleep pulled at her. "'m tired."</p>
<p>"Sammy?" Brooke whispered as she slid under the covers as well. Sam didn't immediately respond. Brooke then realized that Sam was all ready fast asleep.</p>
<p>"Oh Sammy," she smirked.</p>
<p>(I can't get mad at her for falling asleep. I fell asleep after we got home from the doctor and she watched over me. That couldn't have been exciting for me. She took such good care of me and I know how scared she was)</p>
<p>Brooke slid one hand under Sam's nightshirt so that her palm was on Sam's back. She lightly rubbed the silky skin and kneaded the muscles there. She listened as Sam sighed unconsciously in her sleep and moved closer to her. Brooke lay on her side staring at the sleeping beauty.</p>
<p>"You love me, don't you my Sam?" she asked rhetorically as she moved her hand to cup the side of Sam's face.</p>
<p>(But which one of me?) she wondered sadly. It wasn't that she doubted how Sam felt in any way; it was just a small nagging fear in the back of her mind that Sam was substituting her for the `old' Brooke.</p>
<p>(I can't think like that. It's what Sam was afraid of. Besides, I wouldn't give her up for anything) Brooke smiled. Sam mumbled something in her sleep and frowned, her face taking on a look of pure innocence.</p>
<p>"God, you're beautiful," Brooke whispered feeling her heart swell with more love than she thought it possible to feel.</p>
<p>(How did I get so lucky?) she wondered as she drifted off to sleep. (She loves me)</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Pick a Brooke, any Brooke," the carnival barker, oddly enough Brooke herself, dressed in a black suit complete with tails and top hat encouraged. Formerly sleeping Brooke blinked in surprise and shook her head in confusion. She was at an old-fashioned circus sideshow with the tents and trailers, but the last thing she remembered was falling asleep alongside Sam.</p>
<p>(How hard DID I hit my head?) she wondered humorlessly.</p>
<p>"Step right up, don't be shy. Only three tickets to see the Amazing, Ever Changing Brooke McQueen! She's never the same twice!" Barker Brooke continued. Brooke walked up to her carnival counterpart and frowned.</p>
<p>"What the Hell are you talking about?" she asked annoyed. Barker grinned at her, tipped her hat and hopped down from her soapbox.</p>
<p>"Well, lookie who we have here. It's one of the Brooke's herself!" Barker exclaimed happily. "Come on inside, for you it's on the house." She grasped Brooke's hand before she could protest and dragged her into the tent behind them.</p>
<p>"Take a seat, any seat. It's been a slow day so there's plenty to chose from," Barker said as she nonetheless shoved Brooke unceremoniously into a seat next to the rooms only other occupant, yet another Brooke.</p>
<p>"Hi," the other Brooke whispered meekly as she stared into her popcorn. Brooke studied her quiet mirror image as Barker scampered off mumbling something about `showtime'. The quiet girl looked normal enough in her pink sweater and white jeans, she just appeared withdrawn. Her blonde bangs obscured her hazel eyes as she kept her head bowed and didn't meet the newcomers gaze.</p>
<p>"Hi. Been here long?" Brooke asked her to spark conversation and hopefully figure out what was going on. She was dreaming, that much she knew. Beyond that Brooke hadn't a clue. Quiet Brooke nodded without lifting her head.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I'm always here," she mumbled.</p>
<p>"Hey, you can look at me, you know. I don't bite," Brooke joked trying to make the other girl laugh. She saw the corner of the girl's mouth twitch slightly.</p>
<p>"You bit Sammy," Quiet Brooke pointed out playfully, head still bowed. Brooke blushed in shock.</p>
<p>"Uhm?" she stuttered. "How do you know that?"</p>
<p>"I saw it. I was there," Quiet Brooke explained. "I'm glad that you had the guts to finally say the things that I was too afraid to." And then it hit Brooke. The girl next to her was Brooke, from before the accident.</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ!," she gasped. "You're?"</p>
<p>"Yes, she is!" Barker broke in as she strutted across the stage. "Miss Mouse there is none other than Brooke herself. Pre-oak tree, of course. All of those missing memories-WHAM- sitting right there. Mouse, meet the Mouth. Mouth, meet Mouse."</p>
<p>Both girls in the audience sat staring at each other, present and former incarnations of the same girl.</p>
<p>"Wild, ain't it?" Barker teased. Brooke frowned at the performer.</p>
<p>"Then who the Hell are you?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Ah, the ego, I suppose. The self-deprecating humor. At any rate, I'm not what's important."</p>
<p>"So, what is important? Am I here so that you can tell me that my time is up and Mouse here is going to take my life away from me?" Brooke asked, crossing her arms defiantly and bristling at the thought. She wasn't letting go without one Hell of a fight. "Because I hate to tell you this but she can't have it, it's mine."</p>
<p>"It never WAS your life. It was mine," Mouse said quietly. "You're the one who took it from me."</p>
<p>"I did not. You squandered your opportunities. That's not my fault. It's my life now and you can't have it," Brooke argued.</p>
<p>"Girls, girls, girls, take it easy. We're not here to fight amongst ourself. Can't we all just get along?" Barker said over dramatically.</p>
<p>"SHUT UP!" Brooke and Mouse chorused.</p>
<p>"Geeze," Barker sighed. "Shoot the messenger why don't you? OK, chippies, it's like this: Brooke, whether or not Mouse ever leaves this room-well, who the Hell knows? She's not exactly known for having a whole lotta gumption. Her get up and go got up and went," Barker snickered.</p>
<p>"Oh get to the point," Brooke snapped fed up with the cryptic and confusing dream.</p>
<p>"Oh fine, fine, fine," Barker whined. "Take all the fun out of it, ya party poop. Listen real good because I only want to go over this once. I get bored quickly and distracted buy shiny objects easily. That accident did one of two possible things. 1) It totally destroyed who Brooke McQueen was, from birth to that exact moment that she hit the tree. Thus, creating you, Cranky Brooke and the girl you see sitting there is nothing more than a figment, a remnant of something forever gone. Or 2) it caused enough damage to push the original Brooke so far down within herself that she can't find her way out again."</p>
<p>"So which is it?" Brooke asked as Mouse played with the edge of her popcorn bucket.</p>
<p>"Beats the Hell out of me," Barker said with an annoying smirk. "I'm just here to give directions, not answers." Brooke rubbed her temples and wondered if it was possible to get a migraine inside a dream.</p>
<p>"So what is this all about?" she asked frustrated. Barker shrugged.</p>
<p>"I dunno. Either this is simply a dream caused by your subconscious worry about whether or not the real Brooke will ever resurface or it's your unconscious' way of reminding you that she IS still a part of you. But whatever way you look at it, I will give you a piece of free, unsolicited advice," Barker offered. Brooke rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh, fire away. Far be it from me to try and stop you," she said sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Ha ha, you're funny," Barker said back just as scornfully. "Anyway, however way you slice it, you need to find your peace with the situation. Because if you don't, Brooke, you're going to tear yourself apart."</p>
<p>"I AM at peace with the situation," Brooke insisted. Barker tsked her.</p>
<p>"Hon, you're only lying to yourself in here. If you WERE `at peace' with everything, you'd be dreaming about a lot more pleasant things than the fact that you feel like a circus sideshow freak. Like making love to Sammy, for instance," Barker said lecherously while wagging her eyebrows.</p>
<p>"Geeze, are you sure you're not my libido?" Brooke sighed. Barker laughed.</p>
<p>"Hmmm, could be," she snickered. "Anyway, figure it out and soon. That's my advice to you."</p>
<p>"Gee thanks, vague much?" Brooke snapped. Barker shrugged.</p>
<p>"Hey, I'm not here to solve your problems. You figure it out," and with that she left. Brooke stood up to leave.</p>
<p>"Take good care of her, Brooke," Mouse spoke up. She lifted her head and met Brooke's gaze defiantly.</p>
<p>"Because if you don't, I WILL find my way back."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke woke with a start, elbowing Sam in the stomach and startling her.</p>
<p>"Umf!" Sam gasped. She looked over at Brooke who was panting and bathed in sweat.</p>
<p>"Brooke, you OK? Should I call the doctor?" Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, I'm fine. Just a bad dream," she managed between pants. Sam wrapped her arms around the disturbed blonde and rested her head on her back.</p>
<p>"S'OK, it's over now. You're safe," she soothed. Brooke relaxed into Sam's warm embrace and sighed.</p>
<p>"Wanna talk about it?" Sam asked as she buried her nose in the blonde's hair. </p>
<p>"Nah, it was nothing important, Sammy. Just a dream."</p>
<p>"As long as you're sure," Sam yawned.</p>
<p>"I'm positive. Let's go back to sleep."</p>
