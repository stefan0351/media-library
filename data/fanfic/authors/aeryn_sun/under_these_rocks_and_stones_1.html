<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Confession of the Soul -->

<p>Lily opened the door to the school newspaper office to check
and see if the person she wanted was actually there. She was relieved and
dismayed to see Sam sitting in a chair with her feet propped up on a desk
attempting to balance a pencil on the end of her nose. She was apparently
failing miserably. Lily heard her snort as the pencil fell again and she bent
over to retrieve it. </p>
<p>"Working hard or hardly working, Sam?" Lily teased from the
doorway. BANG! Sam slammed her head on the underside of the desk in surprise. </p>
<p>"Ow!" she complained while sitting up and rubbing the injured
part of her skull. Lily was instantly by her side apologetic. </p>
<p>"I am so sorry, Sam," she said as she sat down next to Sam who
scowled at her. "I didn't mean to make you jump like that." Sam's scowl turned
into a good-natured smirk. </p>
<p>"S'OK, minor drain bamage. I think you may have shaved off a
few IQ points but other than that I'll survive," she smiled fully at her petite
friend. "To what do I owe the somewhat heartstopping, concussion causing but
otherwise pleasantly unexpected and welcome solo visit, Lily-cat? Carm and
Harrison busy so you'd figure you'd come slum with me?" </p>
<p>The last statement was said lightly enough and Sam was still
smiling but Lily could still hear the undercurrent of hurt and confusion in
Sam's voice. She could see it Sam's attentive brown eyes, which were focused
intensely on her forcing her to look away in shame. </p>
<p>Lily'd been avoiding Sam a lot lately, barely saying `hello'
or acknowledging Sam if she was in the room, or if she was, suddenly finding
somewhere else to be. Which was sometimes difficult given the fact that they
shared as many classes as they did. Thankfully, to Lily at least, their names
were no where near one another's in the alphabet so she wasn't forced to be near
Sam in that respect. So Lily spent all her time with Carmen and Harrison and no
time with Sam. It wasn't that Sam had done anything lately or that Lily was mad
at her. It was just that when Sam was around lately, Lily felt out of control
and she didn't know what to do about it so she avoided any situation where she
would be around Sam at all. </p>
<p>Sam had noticed Lily's odd behavior of late but had shrugged
it off as a `Lily' thing at first. A particular personality quirk that the girl
was prone to, like campaigning for the rights of dead biology frogs, but when it
didn't go away and seemed directed solely at her, well, that hurt. She cared
about Lily and wanted her as a friend but no one seemed to know what was up with
her. Something about her was bothering Lily and, not wanting to add anymore
stress to an all ready tense relationship, Sam had chosen to leave the bizzarely
behaving girl alone and give her some space. </p>
<p>"I'm not `slumming', Sam. It's been a while since we've had a
chance to talk so I thought if you weren't busy we could," Lily explained. Sam
shrugged non-committally and went back to twirling her pencil between her
fingers. Lily swore it was impossible for the girl to actually sit still for
longer than two seconds, she might spontaneously combust or something. Sam was
like a perpetual motion toy, once you set her in motion, she never stopped. Lily
absently wondered if Sam moved even when she was sleeping. (Does she toss and
turn? Twitch? Shift? ) Hordes of OTHER images involving Sam, a bed, and anything
other than sleeping suddenly invaded Lily's mind and she screwed her eyes up
tight trying to block them out. She was suddenly lightheaded and her stomach
felt funny. She was dimly aware of someone calling her name but it sounded very
far away. It took her a minute to recognize the voice as Sam's. </p>
<p>"Lily?" Sam's concerned voice was suddenly very clear as Lily
opened her eyes and looked into Sam's worried ones. She gulped in mouthfuls of
air and tried desperately to regain control of her breathing, to stop the
hyperventilation caused by a lust induced panic attack. Of course, having the
object of your all-encompassing, heart-stopping lust staring at you unknowingly
full of concern for your well being doesn't exactly help. </p>
<p>"`M fine. Migraine," she lied when she could vocalize again.
Sam tilted her head to the side slightly and sighed. </p>
<p>"Well, if that's the reaction you have to my presence lately,
I can understand why you've been avoiding me like the Plague," she said wryly
although the words were tinged with unspoken hurt. Lily felt a stab of pain and
regret jolt through her at knowing that she had hurt Sam's feelings with her
behavior. </p>
<p>"I haven't been avoiding you, Sam," Lily argued softly. Sam
arched an eyebrow in silent challenge. "OK, so maybe I have, but not for the
reasons you think." </p>
<p>"You don't hate me and curse my very existance?" Sam asked
hopefully. Lily gasped. (Is that what she really thinks? ) </p>
<p>"God, no, Sam. I could never hate you. I would never hate you.
God, where do you come up with this stuff?" Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"Low self-esteem?" she joked. "Or possibly a paranoid streak."
Lily nodded. </p>
<p>"Apparently a little of both," Lily told her. "If I've seemed
a little?off, lately it's because I've had some?issues to deal with." Sam's eyes
lit up. </p>
<p>"Oooo, issues," she teased. "Like what? Save the one-eyed,
albino, Amazonian aardvark? Or the two-toed, two-tongued Transylvanian Tree
Frog?" Lily sighed. She knew Sam wasn't mocking her activism because Sam would
never do that, at least to her face but it was still frustrating. </p>
<p>"Sam, those animals don't even exist," she started.
</p>
<p>"All the more reason to save them," Sam retorted with a wide
grin. Lily resisted the urge to kick her, reminding herself that she was by
nature non-violent. </p>
<p>"Sam, I'm trying desperately to be serious here," Sam's smile
faded and she nodded. </p>
<p>"Serious. Got it. Issues. Shoot." Lily sighed again. The girl
could be damn annoying sometimes and thing was, Lily didn't think Sam was even
aware that she was doing it. Lily rubbed her eyes. She really did feel a
migraine threatening behind her eyes. </p>
<p>She set out with one goal this morning, win or lose, she had
to tell Sam the truth. She couldn't go on like this; it was slowly killing her.
She was tied up in knots and she just knew she was giving herself an ulcer. Sam
had a right to know the real reasons behind the way she'd been acting lately and
it wasn't going to be easy. Chances were that she was going to lose Sam's
friendship in the process but she really couldn't call what they had right now
friendship either. A friendship is based in trust and honesty and she had given
neither to Sam. </p>
<p>Lily was positive of a couple things in her life: wearing fur
was evil, Mary Cherry was insane (and possibly stalking her), and she loved Sam.
Not `friend' love, the `I'll let you cheat off of my math paper' love. No, this
was the `I love you so much it chokes off my air' and `I really should be
arrested for last night's dream' sort of love. </p>
<p>To say that she was shocked to find herself thinking that way
about Sam would be a major understatement but Lily had been aware that her
sexual compass had been pointing towards the `ladies' section for a while now.
It was one of the reasons she hadn't slept with Harrison. And one of the reasons
she'd kissed Carmen. (There's a good place to start) </p>
<p>"Sam, you remember the night that we were all locked in the
Novac and forced, thanks to Nicole to reveal our deepest, darkest secrets?" Sam
gave her a disgusted look. </p>
<p>"Yeah, very educational night. We learned that Brooke slept
with Josh again, Nicole slpet with Josh, Josh is a ho, Carmen kissed Josh, you
kissed Carmen and Mary Cherry is actually an endangered waterfowl. So?" Lily
smirked over how Sam had convienently glossed over her own secret but continued
anyway. </p>
<p>"Well, endangered wildlife aside, Sam, a lot more went on in
that room than I think you realize," now Sam looked confused. </p>
<p>"What?" she asked. Lily pulled her legs up into the chair
beneath her as she started speaking. </p>
<p>"Well, yes, I kissed Carmen and admitted that I questioned my
sexuality," Liyl started. Sam waved her off. </p>
<p>"Don't worry about it, Lil, everybody does," Sam assured her
patiently. "You can't let it keep bothering you." </p>
<p>"That's just it, Sam, it doesn't bother me anymore. And I
don't question it anymore," Lily insisted quietly. </p>
<p>"Oh, OK," Sam said obviously not getting the point. Lily let
out a heavy sigh. (For someone so smart, she has absolutely no grasp on the
obvious) </p>
<p>"I don't think you're following me, Sam. I don't question it
anymore because I know. I know that I'm gay." SWISH! Sam's pencil flew,
dart-like, across the room until it hit the corkboard on the wall. Ironically,
it imbedded itself in a picture of the cheerleading squad, right in the middle
of Nicole's forehead. Sam and Lily tracked its progress and then looked back at
each other. </p>
<p>"Couldn't have done that if I tried," Sam said with a smirk.
Lily just blinked at her. "What? If you were expecting a big freak out, that,"
she pointed to the pencil, "was about it. Sorry to disappoint." </p>
<p>"So you're not at all freaked out?" Lily asked, her voice
small. Sam smiled. </p>
<p>"Well, you look like Lily Esposito, sound like Lily Esposito,
so, you must be her. So you're gay, big friggin' deal," Sam said firmly. Lily
put her head in her hands and burst into tears. Sam frowned. </p>
<p>"OK, those don't look at all like tears of relief, Lil. I
thought I gave the right answer. I said that I don't care that you're gay and I
meant it." </p>
<p>"You don't understand," Lily sobbed. Sam scooted her chair
closer, which made Lily pull away a little. Sam frowned again. She was so
confused her head was beginning to hurt. </p>
<p>"Then explain it to me, Lily," she coaxed soothingly. "What
don't I understand?" Lily raised her tear-streaked face to look into Sam's
caring, if somewhat confused one. </p>
<p>"When I kissed Carmen it did nothing for me because while I
love her, it's only as a friend. But I am in love with someone but I'm afraid
that if I tell that someone I'll lose them forever as a friend," she explained
through her tears. Sam nodded in understanding. </p>
<p>"Oh, OK, I get it. But, Lily, still, you can't keep this
bottled up like this. It's unhealthy. And even if this person doesn't return
your feelings at least things between you will be honest," Sam pointed out
softly. Lily considered this carefully. </p>
<p>"I'm in love with you, Sam. Deeply," she confessed just above
a whisper. She chanced a glance at Sam and was shocked to see her sitting
absolutely still. No movement whatsoever, staring straight ahead unblinking and
it scared Lily. She wasn't even sure Sam was breathing anymore. Lily brought her
hand up to her mouth as she felt the bile rise to the back of her throat and
churn in her stomach. </p>
<p>"Oh God, you're majorly freaked out and now you hate me. I'm
sorry, Sam but I had to tell you. That's why I haven't been around lately. I was
afraid I'd just blurt it out in front of everyone and?and?" she trailed off not
knowing what else to say. She shifted in her seat uncomfortably not knowing
whether she should leave or not. She decided to stay and see what Sam had to
say, if Sam ever came out of her state of shock, that is. </p>
<p>After a horrendously long time, in Lily's opinion, Sam's eyes
finally refocused from whereever they had been and pinned Lily with a look she
had never seen before. Understanding mixed with relief, mixed with regret and
something else Lily couldn't put her finger on just then. </p>
<p>"I don't hate you, Lily," Sam whispered. Lily felt her heart
start to beat again and her lungs reinflate. "I was just really surprised. And
flattered, actually. And relieved that you didn't hate me." Lily's eyes lit up
for a second but then faded. </p>
<p>"But you don't feel the same," she said as a statement and not
a question. Sam shook her head sadly. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Lily, really I am. But my heart is spoken for.
Wholey and completely whether I like it or not," Sam said with a sigh.
</p>
<p>"George," Lily said flatly with a hint of contempt in her
voice. Sam let out a laugh that was more like a bark. </p>
<p>"Yeah, right," she scoffed sarcastically. "That's why I spend
my Friday's at home nursing hot chocolate and watching bad TV movies and he's
out dating his way through the junior class. We broke up a while ago, Lily. I
think you might have missed that while you were `away'." Lily frowned. Sure
she's been living in her own private Sam obsessed bubble but surely Harrison or
Carmen would have told her if Sam were seeing someone else. </p>
<p>"If not George, than who?" Sam gave her a pained look.
</p>
<p>"Not to rub it in, but same as you, someone and something I
can never have," Sam said as a few tears fell down her face. Suddenly it smacked
Lily between the eyes like a sledgehammer. </p>
<p>"Brooke," she whispered in awe. "You're in love with Brooke."
The way Sam's eyes widened in shock and she froze in place again was all the
confirmation Lily needed. </p>
<p>"I don't believe it, you're gay," Lily breathed. Sam glared at
her. </p>
<p>"Oh, sure fine. You decide to `out' yourself in the school
newspaper office and then decide to take me with you. Gee, thanks," she snarled. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Sam, just shocked is all," Lily apologized.
"You're in love with Brooke," she repeated. Sam rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"That's not something you keep throwing in someone's face,
Lily," Sam snapped. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry, really, I'll shut up now," Lily offered. "Shock,
honest. I was shocked." Sam sighed and relaxed a little. </p>
<p>"I know, so was I," she admitted. They stared at each other in
compatible silence for a few long minutes. </p>
<p>"But you can never have her, huh?" Lily asked quietly. A few
more tears slid down Sam's face as she shook her head. </p>
<p>"Unless you know something I don't, no," she tried to joke but
it fell flat. "Brooke's waiting for Mr. Right, not Ms. Maybe who also happens to
almost be her stepsister." Lily leaned in closer. </p>
<p>"Then what about us?" she asked hopefully. Sam sighed again
and looked at her intently. </p>
<p>"I care about you too much to let you play second fiddle to my
feelings for Brooke McQueen," she started gently. </p>
<p>"But I don't care about that," Lily broke in hoping she didn't
sound too desperately longing. Sam gave her a half-smile and reached out to cup
Lily's face in her hand. Lily leaned into the warm embrace. </p>
<p>"But I do," Sam whispered softly. "It wouldn't be fair, to any
of us but especially to you. I can't play with your feelings like that, Lily. I
won't. I don't love you that way," she brushed away Lily's tears that fell near
her hand as she spoke. "I love Brooke," she finished. Lily continued silently
crying, knowing Sam was right but it didn't make it hurt any less. </p>
<p>"Can we?can we still be friends?" Lily asked fearfully after
her tears faded some. Sam smiled. </p>
<p>"I'd really like that. I've missed you Lily-cat. But I'll
understand if being around me hurts too much given how you feel." Lily shook her
head. </p>
<p>"I'd rather be your friend than nothing at all, Sam," Lily
said. Sam's smile widened. </p>
<p>"Then friends it is. But, Lil, nothing we've said leaves this
room," she pointed out. Lily nodded. </p>
<p>"Of course, Sam. I would never," she agreed. </p>
<p>"I know you wouldn't," Sam interrupted her. Lily checked her
watch and winced. </p>
<p>"Crap, I'm gonna be late for work," she sighed. Sam smirked. </p>
<p>"No rest for the wicked, eh?" Lily stood up and shook her
head. </p>
<p>"Nope. You'd better get back to what you were working on when
I got here. What was it anyway? An article on the effects of gravity on a
granite pencil vs. a cute perky upturned nose?" Sam's eyes widened. </p>
<p>"I see that I can expect a fair amount of flirting?" she
teased. Lily blushed and covered her mouth with one hand when she realized what
she had said. </p>
<p>"I am so sorry," she mumbled through her hand, absolutely
mortified. Sam burst out laughing. </p>
<p>"It's OK, Lily, honest. Besides, it was kind of cute. Just be
careful if others are around," Sam giggled. Lily smiled and gave Sam a chaste
kiss on the cheek. </p>
<p>"Thanks for being so understanding, Sam," she said quietly.
Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"That's what friends are supposed to do, Lily. Be there for
one another no matter what. And I'm here for you. I hope you know that now."
Lily nodded. </p>
<p>"I do. Thanks again. Talk to you later," she said as she
opened the door. </p>
<p>"Later Lily," Sam called as she went to retrieve her pencil
from photo-Nicole's forehead. (Well, it's certainly been an interesting
afternoon) </p>
<p>Unknown to both conversationalists, Brooke had arrived at the
room shortly after Lily to see if Sam had wanted a ride home and then left just
before Lily exited and had overheard every word uttered by the two. She stood
around the corner of the newspaper office in stunned shock. </p>
<p>(Lily is in love with Sam but Sam is in love with me? How the
Hell did that happen and what the Hell do I do now? ) She wondered. Just then
Lily rounded the corner and almost bumped into her. </p>
<p>"Oh, hey Brooke," Lily greeted her. Brooke noticed that the
look in Lily's eyes was slightly jealous but no less friendly. </p>
<p>"Uh, hi Lily. Have you seen Sam? I wanted to know if she
needed a ride home," Brooke managed to cover her surprise at overhearing their
very private conversation. An unreadable look, that if Brooke had to name she'd
call longing or regret, passed over Lily's face but it disappeared too quickly
for Brooke to be sure. </p>
<p>"She's in the `paper office. She probably needs a ride too. I
gotta get to work so I'll talk to you later," Lily dashed off leaving Brooke in
her wake. Brooke watched her go for a few seconds before walking slowly to the
door to the newspaper office. She really wasn't sure she wanted to face Sam
right now, knowing what she knew. The decision was taken away from her when the
door flew open and Sam walked out, knocking her over. </p>
<p>"Whoa, Brooke, ya might wanna learn to knock first," Sam
quipped as she offered her hand to the fallen girl. "You OK?" Brooke nodded as
she brushed herself off. </p>
<p>"Hurricane Sam," she laughed nervously. (Why am I nervous?)
Sam smiled brightly. </p>
<p>"That about sums me up," she agreed. "What can I do for you?" </p>
<p>"Need a ride home?" Brooke offered. Sam eyed her suspiciously
for a second but then shrugged. </p>
<p>"Yeah, sure, why not," she said as they walked towards the
school exit. As they walked together in silence, Brooke mulled over exactly what
she was going to do with the knowledge she gained that afternoon. </p>
