<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Thirty Seven -->

<p>"How's your head, love?" Sam asked later as she stroked Brooke's blonde hair away from her face. Brooke was resting her head on Sam's stomach as they lay on the bed waiting for the last of her headache to fade.</p>
<p>"Better," Brooke responded quietly.</p>
<p>"So, let me ask a question," Sam started slowly. "I thought your memory was back, intact. What does this episode mean? I'm confused." Brooke moved up on the bed so that she was lying next to Sam facing her.</p>
<p>"It IS back, for the most part. I just have some?holes," she tried to explain. Sam frowned.</p>
<p>"Holes? Like, do you mean `potholes' or `craters'?"</p>
<p>"Uhm?6th grade is missing, for one thing," Brooke smirked slightly. "I go directly from 5th grade to 7th. I don't recall 6th. Yet."</p>
<p>"You're not missing much," Sam snorted. "Anything else?" Brooke thought for a minute.</p>
<p>"I never really know until the occasion to remember it comes up. I don't remember being crowned Homecoming Queen but I guess that's no big deal," she began. "I only remember sleeping with Josh once although I know according to my diary it was more than that." Sam crinkled her nose and Brooke smiled at her.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know, Sam. And I DEFINITELY don't remember sleeping with Harrison that time."</p>
<p>"Thank God," Sam groaned.</p>
<p>"Seconded. Now whether that's my faulty memory or Harrison's fault is entirely up to personal interpretation," Brooke joked evilly. Sam laughed heartily at this. "You know what else? And it's not so much a memory as a behavior. I mean, I know WHY I developed the eating disorders, my Mom's leaving and all that. But, I DON'T understand how I could do that to myself. Risk my health like that." Sam enveloped her in a tight hug.</p>
<p>"Maybe that means you won't fall into that pattern again?" she wondered hopefully.</p>
<p>"We can certainly hope."</p>
<p>"So, I guess the emotional stuff hits you the hardest? When it comes back, I mean?" Sam asked for clarification. She wanted to understand what Brooke was going through the best that she could. Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah. See, not only does the memory come back but the emotions that go with it do too. It all rushes back at once and sometimes it just overwhelms me. Overloads the circuits. It's scary." Sam felt her shiver and hugged her tighter.</p>
<p>"Seeing you in the road like that again, Sammy. Living through it again?" she shuddered harder and buried her face in Sam's neck.</p>
<p>"Shhh, that was months ago, Brooke. And we're both fine now. Please don't dwell on it."</p>
<p>"Can I sleep with you tonight, Sammy? I feel the need to be close to you," Brooke asked softly, all ready falling asleep safe in Sam's arms.</p>
<p>"Brooke, you know you don't even have to ask. Just go to sleep. I'll be right here when you wake up."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>She was on a mission. There was going to be hell to pay and she was just the person to hand out the check. She pitied anyone that got in her way as she sought out her target. There would be no mercy today. At least, not from her.</p>
<p>"YOU!" she bellowed across the crowded lunchroom when she found her prey. Her victim simply turned to face her, arching one slim eyebrow in defiance. The hunter stalked across the room, aware of every set of eyes watching her but not caring. She reached her intended victim and glared hotly at her.</p>
<p>"I know what you did," she growled. Her prey smirked.</p>
<p>"And what, pray tell, would that be?" she taunted. Without a word, the hunter struck, sending her prey sprawling to the floor a few feet away in a spray of blood. There was complete and utter silence in the room.</p>
<p>"You brode my doze!" Nicole squealed as Brooke grinned evilly down at her, hands still curled into fists silently daring Nicole to get back up. "You brode my doze!" Nicole clutched at her devastated nose, which was pouring blood down her face and all over her silk black top.</p>
<p>"Be glad that's ALL I break, you psycho murderous, drunk driving bitch!" Brooke hissed. The lunchroom erupted into loud cheers and applause. Queen Brooke McQueen had finally struck back against her usurper Nicole Julian. It was a sweet day at Kennedy High School.</p>
<p>Sam strolled up behind Brooke and observed the damage.</p>
<p>"Nice shot," she observed dryly. "But honey, what have we been teaching you about anger management?" Some of the anger seemed to drain from Brooke.</p>
<p>"Sammy, she nearly killed us," she pointed out. Sam nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>"And you just cost her thousands in plastic surgery. I like it," she smiled.</p>
<p>"Ms McQueen," Principal Krupps appeared. "My office." Brooke reluctantly nodded and headed off. "Ms Julian, may I suggest a mop and bucket?" He followed Brooke out.</p>
<p>Nicole scrambled unsteadily to her feet, still clutching at her bleeding nose and trying to see through watery eyes.</p>
<p>"Mud'er fuckin' rug muncher," she swore (nearly as clearly as MC usually spoke normally). "'M gonna sue!" Sam crossed her arms and glared at the injured girl.</p>
<p>"Tell me something, Satan, what bothers you more? The fact that Brooke is a, as you so eloquently put it, `rug muncher'? Or the fact that the `rug' that she `munches' will never be yours?" And with that Sam left Nicole sputtering and seething in the middle of the lunchroom.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Mike and Jane weren't too happy with Brooke's actions. A week's suspension this close to graduation wouldn't look good but Brooke herself was damn satisfied. She sat eating Tootsie Rolls and recounting the actual blow to Sam as they sat by the pool that evening.</p>
<p>"So, I just pulled back and `BLAMMO!', I let her have it!" Brooke laughed. "I felt her nose give out too. It was gross but SO cool."</p>
<p>"What did Krupps have to say about it actually?" Sam asked.</p>
<p>"Well, first he said that he couldn't condone school violence, week suspension, permanent record, blah blah, woof woof. Then he said, off the record of course, that 1) nice shot and; 2) he was wondering how long it'd take me to get around to doing that."</p>
<p>"Geeze," Sam laughed. "She was so pissed, Brooke. You should have seen her after you left. I wish I had it on camera."</p>
<p>"Me too. It'd be great to relive over and over?"</p>
<p>"In slo-mo?"</p>
<p>"Reverse?"</p>
<p>"Freeze frame?" They broke out into hysterical laughter.</p>
<p>"Oh God," Brooke wiped the laughter induced tears from her eyes and sighed. "No school for a week and a Pink concert on Friday. I've got a gorgeous girlfriend by my side to boot. Hmmm?my life is just about perfect."</p>
<p>"Lucky dog," Sam accused. "I still have to go to school."</p>
<p>"Hey, deck Harrison. Join me in my debauchery," Brooke wagged her eyebrows.</p>
<p>"Heh, don't tempt me," Sam sighed. "I haven't seen old psycho stalker boy around since the other day, have you?" Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"Come to think of it, since we talked to his Mom, no, I haven't," she realized.</p>
<p>"I wonder where he got to," Sam said out loud.</p>
<p>"His mother sent him to Florida," Jane said quietly from behind the screen door. Both girls turned to face her. "I spoke to Robin today when I picked up your prescription refill, Brooke. Seems she tried to talk to him that night and he went off on her. Wouldn't listen to reason. He swears that you're still in love with him, Brooke, and that Sam's got you brainwashed."</p>
<p>"So she sent him to sunny Florida? Great solution," Sam muttered sarcastically.</p>
<p>"He's at a psychiatric facility there, under the supervision of his grandparents. According to Robin, he got rather violent with her when she was trying to talk to him. She had to call the police. She's heartbroken but, she thinks it's the best thing for everyone. She can't deal with him but she's hoping that the center can help him deal with his seeming obsession with Brooke and hatred for you, Sam. She knows that he probably won't ever change his views on homosexuality but, she's hoping he can find some peace," Jane explained. She watched Sam's face fall and a shadow pass over her daughter's eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh my God," Sam whispered, breaking down. Harrison was her best friend for almost her entire life. Now he was a virtual stranger who hated her for who she loved. Her heart broke.</p>
<p>Jane started to move towards her distraught daughter to comfort her but stopped when she saw Brooke switch chairs and pull Sam into her arms to weep with her. Right now, what they really needed, was each other.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"So, Harrison finally went around the bend? Wow," Lily said astounded. Brooke and Sam both nodded.</p>
<p>"Around the bend, down the embankment, and into the river from the sound of it," Carmen added. They were sitting around watching movies the next night after Jane told them the news.</p>
<p>"Hopefully he'll get the help he needs," Sam sighed.</p>
<p>"Is electroshock therapy legal in Florida?" Brooke asked cheekily.</p>
<p>"Brooke?" Sam said threateningly.</p>
<p>"Hey Brooke, I got those pictures you asked for," Lily broke in. She reached into her bag and pulled out 34 full color photos of Nicole with 2 big black eyes and tape over her nose. They were obviously taken throughout a day or so and several had her charging the camera like a bull. Brooke flipped through them laughing.</p>
<p>"Oh, these are priceless," she hooted.</p>
<p>"She's still threatening to sue," Carmen warned. "'She brode my doze!' God, I loved it!"</p>
<p>"Let her sue," Brooke challenged. "I'll get off, what with being an accident victim and all. I was not in my right mind when I acted." She said this as innocently as she could manage. Lily and Carmen laughed at her from their spot on the floor before turning back to the movie.</p>
<p>"I'd like to get you `off' in a totally different manner," Sam purred, leaning close so that only Brooke could hear her. Brooke bit her lip to stifle a whimper.</p>
<p>Keeping one eye on their friends to make sure that they were still focused on the movie, Sam flattened her tongue and ran it up the side of Brooke's neck, making her shiver. She then nipped at the former cheerleader's jawline and proceeded to tease her ear, feeling the lean form squirm to be closer. She could feel Brooke's breathing increase and her pulse racing beneath her kisses.</p>
<p>She slipped her hand under Brooke's top for access to hot smooth skin. Using her thumb and forefinger she teased the blonde's nipples until they were painfully erect. Brooke wanted to beg Sam to switch her hand with her mouth but was afraid that Lily and Carmen would catch them. When Sam felt that Brooke had been sufficiently tortured above, she slipped her hand down the front of Brooke's sweat pants.</p>
<p>She bit down on Brooke's shoulder to hide her own moan at feeling how hot and wet Brooke had become. Her fingers glided easily through the silky wetness over Brooke's swollen lips. She felt Brooke move against her hand even as the blonde's head fell back and her eyes closed.</p>
<p>"Uh?guys?" Lily broke in without turning away from the TV. "We're not deaf. Or stupid. Take the how monkey sex upstairs because I'M getting all hot and bothered." They were gone before she finished speaking.</p>
<p>"Great," she turned to Carmen. "Now I have a circus in my pants." Carmen arched an eyebrow at her.</p>
<p>"Don't look at me. I love ya, Lil, but I don't LOVE ya," she said smiling. "Besides, I hate the circus. Clowns scare me."</p>
<hr></hr>

<p>Afterward, Sam lay quietly next to Brooke, just watching the blonde breathe, tracing her fingers over Brooke's flushed cheeks. Slowly, Brooke's eyes fluttered open and she locked gazes with Sam. They stared silently at each other for a long time not needing to communicate verbally. After a while, Brooke yawned.</p>
<p>She threw one long tanned leg over Sam's body possessively and then pulled the brunette as close as she could manage.</p>
<p>"I love you, Sam McPherson," she whispered as she drifted off to sleep. "I always have." Sam smiled.</p>
<p>"I know. And I love you too."</p>
