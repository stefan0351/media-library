<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Chapter One -->

<p>"Will you calm down, Brooke? God, who are you suddenly? My mother?" Sam snapped as Brooke stood in her bedroom door with her hands on her hips staring angrily at her.</p>
<p>"No, Sam, I'm not but you can't go out with Nicole," she responded in a firm tone. Sam laughed sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Says who? You? What's the matter, Brooke? Jealous?" Sam tossed out while rechecking her hair. Brooke jumped at the comment and then realized that Sam meant jealous that she was going out with Nicole and not the other way around.</p>
<p>"No, I'm not. But you dating Nic is like...I don't know. It goes against the natural order of the universe or something," Brooke argued. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"I thought you were OK with me being gay," she said quietly. Brooke stepped closer.</p>
<p>"Oh, I AM, Sammy. I just don't want to see you date Nicole of all people. You 'affectionately' refer to the girl as Satan for God's sake. You two hate each other," she reminded her.</p>
<p>"You and I hated each other for a long time," Sam said. "Look at us now."</p>
<p>"Apples and oranges, Sam. I have a heart, Nic doesn't. I don't want to see her hurt you."</p>
<p>"Nice way to talk about your best friend," Sam scoffed. Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"She's no friend of mine, not anymore," she said softly. Sam frowned at her.</p>
<p>"See, that's what I don't get. You two were fine until I started dating her. What happened to ruin your friendship? Is it me?" Sam asked. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, it's nothing. Just grew apart. I'm tired of her hurting me, using me and I don't want her to do the same to you." Sam walked over to the blonde and grasped her hand.</p>
<p>"I'm a big girl, Brooke. I appreciate the concern but I can take care of myself. Besides, Nic has made it clear what she wants out of this relationship and I'm OK with that." Brooke looked Sam in the eyes, slightly fearful.</p>
<p>"And that is?" Sam blushed and smirked.</p>
<p>"Fun. She's not looking for a long-term commitment. Just someone to have fun with, that sort of thing," Sam explained shyly.</p>
<p>"Sex," Brooke clarified a bit offended. Sam arched an eyebrow at her.</p>
<p>"If you want to be crude about it, yes there is that," she said curtly.</p>
<p>"Sammy, I thought you were better than that," Brooke accused.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, but what do you really know about me, Brooke? Maybe I want the same thing. Besides, even if I don't, Nicole's a good-looking girl and not a half-bad consolation prize. I can think of worse ways to spend my Friday nights."</p>
<p>"Consolation prize?" Brooke asked. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"Nevermind. The point is I can't have what I want so I'm going with what's offered to me. For now. Why not, you know? Why should I stay home alone when I don't have to?" Sam grabbed her jacket off her bed and headed to the door. "See ya later, Brooke."</p>
<p>"Night Sam," Brooke sighed as Sam left. She didn't have the heart to tell Sam to have a nice time. That was the last thing she wanted.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam let out a heavy sigh as she drove to Nicole's house. She hated arguing with Brooke and didn't understand why she was doing it so often lately. Brooke had taken the truth about her sexual orientation surprisingly well; the blonde seemed almost relieved. But when she's started dating Nicole, the tension that had long ago faded between her and Brooke resurfaced. They no longer shared their easy flowing banter and Brooke seemed overly tense. And for the life of her, Sam couldn't figure it out.</p>
<p>And then there was whatever was going on between Brooke and Nicole. They went from best friends to worst enemies faster than Sam could say 'boo'. Do not pass Go, do not collect 200 dollars. They were at each other?s throats. Any little thing they could do to the other, they did. Nicole had taken great joy in reminding Brooke that she'd slept with Josh and now Josh was with Lily. While Brooke didn't have feelings for Josh anymore, the fact that Nic had slept with him was still a sore spot. In payback, Brooke had made sure that three of the colleges Nicole had applied to not only got copies of her academic reports, but of her 'extra curricular' activities as well: i.e. cheating on tests, the scandals and such. Needless to say, those were three colleges that would not be accepting Nicole to their fall classes.</p>
<p>While at any other time, watching Brooke rip into Nicole would have been fun, it was disturbing Sam right now. Not because she was dating Nicole. She knew what kind of person Nicole was and knew the shorter blonde more than deserved her comeuppance, but it bothered Sam that something else was really bugging Brooke. Something more than the whole 'Nicole' thing and the head cheerleader wouldn't talk about it.</p>
<p>Sam missed the long talks she and Brooke used to enjoy before all this started. Sometimes late at night when they both couldn't sleep, they'd stay up and just talk about everything and nothing. Like sisters, Sam supposed. But Sam's feelings for Brooke were much more than sisterly. It was her feelings for her blonde housemate that made her face the fact that she was gay. She loved Brooke and knew that she would never have her as anything more than a good friend. It broke her heart to be that close but forever closed off from what she wanted. Brooke was whom she was referring to when she said she couldn't have what she wanted. So when Nicole talked to her about maybe seeing each other outside of school in a dating sense, while Sam was shocked, she had to admit Nic wasn't that bad a second choice. And like she'd told Brooke, all Nic really wanted was 'fun'. And that didn't seem so bad either. If she couldn't have what she wanted, she'd settle for what she could get, for now.</p>
<p>She parked her car at the Julian mansion and went to the door where Clive, the middle-aged butler let her in. He was a nice guy but obviously had a thing against Nicole.</p>
<p>"Miss Julian is in her room, Miss McPherson," he said boredly. "The house belongs to the two of you for the night, the staff has been given off. If you get hungry, Cook left some food in the kitchen for you. If you DO need anything else, including a rabies shot," he mumbled under his breath as Sam smirked slightly. "Feel free to page the guest house and someone will be along shortly. Have a pleasant evening?if that?s possible," he added snidely before leaving.</p>
<p>"Gee, thanks," Sam snickered as she climbed the stairs to Nicole?s room. The beauty of the Julian house never ceased to amaze and enthrall Sam. But aside from being beautiful, the house had a cold aura about it. It wasn?t a home, it was a statement, and it made Sam nervous.</p>
<p>"Nic, you in there?" she called as she knocked on Nicole?s door. While they had no concrete plans, it was unlike Nicole not to be ready when Sam arrived.</p>
<p>"Yes, Sam, come in," Nicole called from the other side of the door. Sam shrugged and opened the door. Her breath caught in her throat as she saw what awaited her. The room was bathed in candles and roses, giving it a soft glow and sweet scent. But it was Nicole in nothing but a sheer red teddy that stole Sam?s breath away. She looked radiant standing beside the bed with a small smile.</p>
<p>"I?I?I?" Sam stuttered in shock. Nicole laughed lowly.</p>
<p>"Ah, articulate as ever I see," she teased. Sam blushed. "Come here, I don?t bite?unless you want me too," she added cheekily. Sam swallowed convulsively and slowly walked over where Nicole gathered the slightly trembling girl in her arms.</p>
<p>"Hey, calm down, Sam. I wanted to surprise you. You said the other day that you thought you were ready for this and I thought tonight would be the perfect time," Nicole explained as she stroked Sam?s back gently. She pulled back and looked into Sam?s rich brown eyes.</p>
<p>"If you?re not ready Sam?" she started but Sam cut her off with a passionate kiss. When they broke apart, Nicole watched amazed as Sam?s eyes got impossibly darker and she stared at the short blonde with a look that made the girl?s knees weak.</p>
<p>"Oh, I?m ready Nic," Sam purred, again making standing difficult for Nicole. Nicole wondered for a moment what the heck she?d gotten wrapped up in. </p>
<p>"Trust me, Nicole, I?m ready."</p>
