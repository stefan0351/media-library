<!-- New Path, Old Faces \ Please Sammy, Pretty Please -->

<p>Brooke was not one to beg, it was beneath her. But Sam was
being unreasonable. Not that Brooke could really blame her. Last years prom had
been a horrible experience even before Nicole's bad personal impersonation of
Speed Racer and Sam had gotten so badly hurt. The whole Harrison debacle was
enough to make anyone want to swear off formal occasions and dances for life.
Brooke almost lost everything that night and it still frightened her. The
occasional nightmare reminded her of that fact. Sometimes, usually around three
in the morning, she'd see Sam in her dreams, lying hurt in the street and the
only thing that chased that image away was seeing Sam lying there safe, with her
in bed asleep. </p>
<p>But right now, Sam was being her usual obstinate self and
refusing to go to the Senior Prom despite the fact that Brooke wanted to go. Sam
gave Brooke her blessing to go without her because she had no real interest in
going herself but Brooke didn't want to go without her. The fact that the school
board had said `no' to same-sex couples attending the prom was a small
inconsequential problem to the girls. They knew that they could go stag or with
dates and hang out together. There were always ways around the rules. And if
anyone could find them, it was Brooke and Sam. </p>
<p>Which was why Brooke was as frustrated as she was right now.
While she could wholeheartedly understand Sam's reluctance to attend the prom,
Brooke saw it as an opportunity to erase the bad memories from last year or at
least create new, better and happier ones together. She just couldn't get Sam to
see that. And then there was Sam's notoriously infamous pathological hatred of
formal dresses. Even if Brooke somehow got her to agree to go, it'd be a whole
other battle to get her to wear a proper dress. </p>
<p>(One thing at a time) Brooke told herself as she quietly
approached Sam's room. She could hear the typing coming from Sam's keyboard
filtering out through the open door. (First we get her to say `yes' and then we
worry about the dress) </p>
<p>She peeked through the door and spied Sam sitting at her desk
typing on her laptop. She felt her heart do its usual flipflop in her chest at
seeing her love. No matter how many times she looked at Sam, held Sam, or how
many times Sam said `I love you' there was still an aura of wonder and disbelief
that it was all true, that Sam returned her feelings as strongly. It was like a
beautiful soap bubble with its changing colors in the light; Brooke was still
slightly afraid that too much pressure or a strong gust of wind would burst it.
But they'd been through a lot and with each hurdle, their bond grew stronger and
Brooke's fear diminished more. She walked up behind Sam and put her hands on
Sam's shoulders. </p>
<p>"Heya, Sammy, what are you working on?" she asked, watching
Sam smile at her through the reflection of the screen. Sam leaned her head back
so that it rested against Brooke's abdomen and Brooke started running her
fingers through Sam's long brown locks. </p>
<p>"Nothing much, Princess, just an English paper," Sam murmured.
"How about you? What are you up to?" Brooke grinned. </p>
<p>"I came to see what my hot and sexy girlfriend was doing," she
answered leaning down to kiss Sam lightly. Sam's lips quirked up a little
further and she arched an eyebrow. </p>
<p>"You have a hot and sexy girlfriend? Lucky you," she joked
earning herself a light swat on the head from Brooke. </p>
<p>"Ha ha, funny Sam," Brooke said sarcastically. She spun Sam
around in her seat and sat on her lap, straddling her. "Can I talk to you?" she
asked seriously. Sam tilted her head and nodded. </p>
<p>"Of course, Princess," Sam told her. Brooke ran her hands
through the hair at Sam's temples. She loved Sam's hair, it was silky and soft
and smelled of vanilla scented shampoo. </p>
<p>"Why won't you go to prom?" Brooke asked directly. Sam rolled
her eyes and sighed. </p>
<p>"Why do you keep harrassing me about that?" she asked annoyed.
"You know I'd rather give Mary Cherry a pedicure. And after last year's
`wonderful' experience is it any wonder why?" Now it was Brooke's turn to roll
her eyes. </p>
<p>"Sam," she started patiently as she chased the image caused by
the words `Mary Cherry' and `pedicure' from her mind. "No one's going to be
drinking obsessive amounts of Jose Cuervo or running into the street upset." She
cupped Sam's face in her palms. "So, no one's going to be gunning their car at
me in the middle of the street. And you lived through the wedding so, let's go
to the prom." </p>
<p>"I know all that, Brooke," Sam said a little less annoyed but
no more enthusiastic. "It's just I don't want to go." Brooke frowned.
</p>
<p>"Why?" </p>
<p>"Brooke?" Sam hedged. Brooke kissed Sam again softly and
looked intently into those chocolate brown eyes she loved so much. </p>
<p>"Why Sammy?" she asked again. Sam looked away unable to keep
the gaze. </p>
<p>"Cuz I can't go `with' you," Sam finally answered in a voice
so quiet Brooke almost missed it. Brooke couldn't help the small smile that
crossed her face. </p>
<p>"That's what's bothering you so much?" she asked. Sam nodded
and Brooke brought Sam's face back up to meet hers. "Sammy, there are ways
around that stupid rule." Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"I know but it's so stupid," Sam said. "I love you, I'm dating
you and I would want to go with you if I were to go. I don't want to have to
find a way around the rules. I mean, everyone knows about us now so what's the
point in going with someone else?" An idea suddenly struck Brooke. It was
beautiful in its simplicity. </p>
<p>"So we'll go together," she said happily. Sam stared at her
like she suddenly went bald and toothless. </p>
<p>"Excuse me? Reality check, aisle three," Sam joked. Brooke
shook her head in amusement. </p>
<p>"OK, try and stay with me, Swifty," Brooke kidded while Sam
smiled at her. "We'll go alone, together." Sam still looked at her like she was
strange. </p>
<p>"Recently experience a head injury, Princess?" </p>
<p>"God, you're infuriating sometimes," Brooke sighed. "We go
stag and spend the night together. It bends the rules but doesn't really break
them. What are they going to do, throw us out?" </p>
<p>"You never know," Sam challenged. She searched the pleading
look on Brooke's face. "Does it really mean that much to you that we go,
Princess?" Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Yes, Sammy, it does," she responded sticking out her bottom
lip in a pout. "Pretty please, Sammy, with sugar on top?" Unable to resist that
look, Sam finally relented. </p>
<p>"Ug, OK, fine, we'll go. But what's in it for me?" she asked
cheekily. Brooke's face lit up at Sam's agreement and upon hearing the last part
of Sam's statement, she pulled Sam's face closer and smirked. </p>
<p>"Hmm?let me think on that last part," she said huskily. "How
about me on top?" </p>
