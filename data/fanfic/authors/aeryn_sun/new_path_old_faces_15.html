<!-- New Path, Old Faces \ Vacation -->

<p>It was mid-July and Sam and Brooke were vacationing at a
beachside resort further up the coast. Brooke was watching Sam sun herself on
the beach and thought back to where they were a year ago. Sam was lying in a
coma and Brooke was begging her to wake up. Fast forward a year and they were in
love and lying on a beautiful beach together. What a difference a year could
make. And Brooke wouldn't trade any of it; she'd spare Sam the pain if she could
but she wouldn't trade anything else. </p>
<p>She shifted in her chair to get a better look at Sam and knew
without a doubt that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with the sweet
brunette. Sam had been so sensitive and patient with her lately as she fought
her `mother' issues and eating disorders, again. Never once did Sam make her
feel stupid or worthless but instead like she was the center of Sam's universe.
Not that Sam wasn't firm with her but she wasn't mean, she was understanding and
Brooke doubted that there was ever enough she could do to thank Sam for all
she'd done for her. </p>
<p>"Penny for them, love," Sam said as she opened one eye and
looked at Brooke. </p>
<p>"I love you," Brooke responded. Sam smiled at her. </p>
<p>"I love you too," Sam said back. Brooke shook her head.
</p>
<p>"You don't get it. I want to spend my life with you, Sammy."
Sam quirked an eyebrow at her. </p>
<p>"Why Ms McQueen, are you proposing marriage?" she joked
half-heartedly. Her heart was thundering in her chest. </p>
<p>"Why, would you say yes?" Brooke asked seriously. Sam stared
at her. </p>
<p>"If the day ever came, Princess. Without hesitation," Sam
answered honestly. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Someday Sammy, that day will come," she smiled. </p>
<p>"Then I can wait. And I will say yes." </p>

<p>Brooke shifted nervously from foot to foot waiting for Sam to
come home to the hotel room a week later in early August. She'd gone out to get
snacks and Brooke was getting antsy waiting. Soon though she heard the key in
the lock and the door opened. Sam walked in, threw her keys on the table and put
the grocery bags on the counter. </p>
<p>"OK, I got ice cream, yogart, chips, dips, whips, and chains,"
she joked as Brooke walked over. "Soda and a few other necessities. Whatcha up
to, Princess?" </p>
<p>"Waiting for you," Brooke answered honestly. Sam grinned. </p>
<p>"Waiting with baited breath, eh?" Brooke circled her arms
around Sam's waist. </p>
<p>"Oh, yeah," Brooke said. "Here, sit down." She lead Sam to a
chair and sat her down in it. "I've got something for you." Sam's eyes lit up. </p>
<p>"Ooo, presents, goody," she cooed. Brooke rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Do you know what today is?" Brooke asked. Sam tilted her
head. She did but decided to let Brooke have the moment. </p>
<p>"Refresh my memory," she requested. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"It was a year ago today that you told me how you really felt
about me and I confessed my love for you," Brooke told her. </p>
<p>"I know," Sam smiled. "Our first anniversery." </p>
<p>"Right, you do remember," she smiled with joy that Sam
remembered. "Well, I wanted to do something special so I got you this," she
pulled out a small velvet box and handed it to Sam. Sam opened it and a wide
grin spread across her face. Inside the box was a beautiful silver Clauddah
ring. </p>
<p>"It's beautiful, Brooke," Sam gasped. Brooke smiled.
</p>
<p>"It means love, loyalty and friendship. You have all three
from me, Sam, unconditionally. The heart is my love, which is endless; the hands
are my friendship, which is boundless; and the crown is my loyalty, which I give
without question. If you wear it with the heart facing out it means you're free
but if you wear it facing towards you it means your heart is taken." Brooke put
the ring on Sam's left ring finger with the heart facing Sam so that everyone
would know Sam was taken. </p>
<p>"Wear it here until the day we say `I do', Sammy?" she asked.
Sam nodded as she wiped away a few tears. </p>
<p>"Of course. I got something for you too," Sam said. She
reached for her jacket and pulled a box from the pocket. Brooke opened the box
and looked at the diamond heart pendant inside with a gasp. </p>
<p>"Oh, Sammy," she whispered. </p>
<p>"Not as sweet or sentimental as yours but, I wanted to give
you my heart to keep and it was the best I could do," Sam explained shyly. She
removed the pendant and placed the chain around Brooke's neck and fastened it. </p>
<p>"It's perfect, Sam," Brooke told her as she wiped away her own
tears. She drew Sam to her for a scorching kiss. </p>
<p>"Happy anniversary, Sam," Brooke whispered. </p>
<p>"Happy anniversary, Brooke." </p>
