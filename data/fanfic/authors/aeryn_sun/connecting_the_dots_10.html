<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Ten -->

<p>Sam hurried into the diner and to the table where Harrison already sat
impatiently drumming his fingers tunelessly. </p>
<p>"Hey," she said out of breath. Harrison glared at her. </p>
<p>"You're late," he growled. Sam sighed and rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Five minutes, take a pill," she shot back. </p>
<p>(Oh, this is starting out so well) she thought humorlessly. </p>
<p>"What did you want to see me about anyway, Harrison? We're not exactly
buddies anymore," Sam pointed out although she knew Harrison had called her here
to talk to her about Brooke. And part of Sam was disappointed that she and
Harrison were no longer friends. She missed him, he'd been a best friend for
most of her life and it felt like part of her life was missing now that he
wasn't part of it. Harrison's eyes narrowed further and Sam could tell she
wasn't going to enjoy lunch. </p>
<p>"What did you say to Brooke to make her break up with me?" he asked angrily.
Sam sighed. She could see that there'd be no pleasantries with Harrison today.
</p>
<p>"I didn't say anything to her. She reached her decision on her own," Sam
explained calmly. She refused to get dragged into Harrison's unique brand of
theatrics. </p>
<p>"That's bullshit, Sam. You had to have said something to make her turn on me
like that. Brooke never would have acted the way she did the other night," he
accused bitterly. Sam rolled her eyes again. </p>
<p>"You know what you haven't realized yet, Harrison? 'This' Brooke is not the
'old' Brooke. She may never be her again. You can't keep expecting the same
behavior from someone who essentially isn't that person," she said patiently.
</p>
<p>"But she is still Brooke!" Harrison contended angrily. </p>
<p>"In body maybe but not in mind," Sam countered. "Harrison, you might as well
accept the fact that the person she was died in that accident. Brooke is gone,
at least for the time being. Even the doctors don't know when or even if she'll
ever get her memory back. Let her go, Harrison and get to know who she is now,"
Sam beseeched on behalf of the new Brooke. Harrison shook his head. </p>
<p>"How can you act so calm? How can you not care that she's gone?" he asked
upset. </p>
<p>"Harrison, I do care. I grieve everyday for the person we've lost. But, in an
odd way, she's still here. I am getting to know who she is now. It's all I can
do." </p>
<p>"We were happy, Sam. Feelings just don't disappear," Harrison declared. Sam
took a sip of her water and thought about her response. </p>
<p>"They do if the memory isn't there to back them up," she said simply. "Or if
the feelings were never there to start with. Besides, maybe you were happy but
she wasn't even before the accident." Harrison's face turned red. </p>
<p>"Oh yeah? How would you know? You don't know anything about happiness, Sam.
You haven't let yourself be happy a day in your sad, miserable, pathetic life.
You've spent so much time being the sarcastic, distant, unemotional, objective
one that you don't even HAVE emotions anymore!" Harrison ranted loudly drawing
the attention of some of the other patrons. </p>
<p>"Keep your voice down, you creep!" Sam hissed. "And stop acting like a
self-righteous, spoiled little brat who has to blame everyone else when he
doesn't get his own way." </p>
<p>"I'm acting spoiled? You're the one who's been lashing out at everyone else
since I picked Brooke over you. You didn't get what you wanted so you took it
out on everyone else," Harrison accused. Sam arched an eyebrow and scoffed. </p>
<p>"Buy a clue, Mr. John. You ain't all that," she said lowly. Harrison leaned
closer over the table. </p>
<p>"I picked Brooke over you so you stopped speaking to me," he started with an
evil gleam in his eye. Whatever he was going to say, Sam knew he'd been working
on it for awhile. </p>
<p>"Then you punished Brooke, who cared about you a lot. You meant the world to
her, Sam. You were her best friend and sister. Your friendship, your opinion,
your mere presence was everything to her and yet you turned your back on her.
You took away your friendship, looked down at her like she'd done something
wrong and then LEFT her. Just like her mother did," Harrison's tone was cruel
and mocking. Sam had to fight against the sting of tears in her eyes and the
hurt in her chest that his words caused. </p>
<p>"You did all that to her and yet she still cared for you. You abandoned her
and she forgave you. I can't say the same for Lily or Carmen. You left for San
Diego without so much as a good-bye to them. You never wrote, never e-mailed, or
called. You shut them out entirely when they weren't even involved in this mess.
Tell me, Sam, which one of us is the 'self-centered spoiled brat'?" </p>
<p>Sam was shock quiet for several minutes as Harrison's words rang in her ears.
They were valid points, all. She had done all of that and she wasn't proud of
it. But there was nothing she could do to change it now. </p>
<p>"Harrison, I made a lot of mistakes this summer," she began, holding up her
hand to stop him when he opened his mouth to retort. </p>
<p>"Let me finish, you had your say, let me have mine. Yes, I made mistakes and
did things that I'm not proud of. I'm trying to make up for them now. But none
of that changes the fact that Brooke broke up with you because SHE wanted to.
Not because I told her to. She doesn't have feelings for you. Deal with it and
stop blaming others for your shortcomings as an individual," she commanded as
she stood up to leave. </p>
<p>"You jealous, mean-spirited, backstabbing, manipulative bitch!" Harrison
insulted loudly. Sam tossed her water into his face. </p>
<p>"Cool off you ass. You just decribed Nicole Julian, not me. Give me a call
when you grow up and start acting your age," she sneered before stomping out of
the diner and leaving Harrison sputtering in her wake. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke warily eyed yet another pink top and tossed it into the 'old' Brooke
box. She really wasn't all that fond of pink. Red, purple, and blues were OK but
pink was too much. She'd changed the bedspread to something more sedate, a light
blue and purple Native American pattern and had converted the rest of the room
to match. It felt a lot more comfortable to her not. Next came the arduous
project of changing her waredrobe to fit as well. She liked most of her old
stuff, save for some of the pinker items it wasn't half bad. She was digging
around under the bed when she found the small locked diary. </p>
<p>(Well, well, well, what have we here?) she smirked. After another fifteen
minutes of scrummaging for the key, she finally jimmied open the lock with a
screwdriver. </p>
<p>The diary went back quite a ways, almost to the beginning of her sophomore
year. Apparently there were times when she had written more often than others.
She flipped aimlessly through the boring entries about Josh, the Glamazons,
school, and her weight until Sam's name caught her eye. </p>
<p>***I have no idea what Sam McPherson's problem is. Every year I swear she
gets worse. It's like she's out to get me but I've never done anything to her.
She hates me for no other reason than that I'm popular. I never asked to be
popular and half the time I don't even want it. From what I've seen of Sam, she
doesn't seem half bad- when her broomstick isn't up her butt. I wish she'd see
that I'm not all that bad either and that there's more to me than the 'popular'
image.*** </p>
<p>Brooke giggled. Even without her memory she could sense the confusion and
frustration written on the page. She scanned some more of the entries for more
on Sam. </p>
<p>***I hate her! I'm going to kill her! Doesn't Sam think that I have feelings
too? I think she lives just to hurt and destroy me. She wrote an editorial that
was totally mean and biased and made me look foolish. And then she had the gaul
to gloat about it! She is always in my face about something. She's driving me
absolutely insane. But I swear I will get even with her for this.*** </p>
<p>***I got even today! :) I made Sam look so stupid in front of the whole
lunchroom. God, that felt soooooo good. She got so angry and I loved watching
her face turn red. I got all tingly. Is that the right reaction? Now I feel kind
of bad though. What if she stays mad? I didn't really want to hurt her, I just
wanted her to see how it felt.*** </p>
<p>*** My world has ended! My father and that she-witch Sam's mother are
involved...with EACH OTHER! Are you insane, God? Sam can not move into MY house.
I don't want her here. I'll have to look at her everyday, talk to her too. God,
there'll be no escape. And if Dad marries Jane, I'll be Sam's step-sister! Oh,
the HORROR!!!!*** </p>
<p>Brooke laughed as she read. The entries alternated between outright dislike
for Sam and the growing desire to be closer to the girl. She could tell that at
some point she wanted to be friends with Sam and wondered if she ever realized
when exactly her feelings had changed. </p>
<p>***I made the biggest mistake of my life the other night. I had sex with
Josh. I really wish I hadn't done it but I felt obligated...pressured to. Josh
is a great guy but I just don't feel that way towards him anymore. It was
painful and not at all what I had expected. I thought that it'd be beautiful and
fulfilling. Instead it left me feeling empty and guilty. I hope Sam listens and
takes my advice to wait for the right person. Josh obviously wasn't 'the one'.
Now I've gone and ruined a beautiful thing. I hope Sam is smarter than I was.
She's so beautiful and special that her first time should be magical.*** </p>
<p>(Ah Ha!) Brooke thought. (There we go. I may not have realized it at the time
but I've liked her for awhile now) </p>
<p>She continued reading, watching as the entried about Sam grew more frequent
and caring. One in particular caught her eye. </p>
<p>***I think I'm in trouble. I had the greatest dream last night. Candlelight
and roses, soft music and strong arms. I swear I have never felt that way
before. I mean, I've had sex dreams before but never so vivid, so fulfilling. I
let this 'ghost' have their way with me, absolutely enjoying it to no end until
I had to see their face. I had to see who was making me feel so wonderful and
loved. I opened my eyes and...it was SAM! I was making love to/with my
soon-to-be stepsister! And instead of pushing her away or being upset, I pulled
her to me and let the dream continue. It's what I wanted, SHE'S who I want, God
help me. What do I do now? God, she's all I can think about.*** </p>
<p>It was dated shortly before she had started dating Harrison. Brooke
recognized that relationship for what it was now, denial. She had started dating
Harrison to forget her attraction to Sam but it obviously hadn't worked. Without
the memories of how things used to be or should be, she saw no reason to deny
the way she felt. And given the way Sam reacted to her earlier, she had good
reason to suspect that Sam felt the same way. </p>
<p>She heard the front door slam and hastily shoved the diary under the
mattress. She got up and met a very irate Sam halfway up the stairs. </p>
<p>"Self-centered, narrow-minded, egocentric prick," Sam ranted. Brooke had
never seen Sam so angry. True, she only had a few weeks worth of memory to draw
from but she still didn't like seeing Sam so upset. </p>
<p>"That bad, huh?" she asked quietly as she followed Sam into her room. Sam
flopped down face first onto her bed. </p>
<p>"He accused me of orchestrating the breakup," she explained around her
pillow. "He then proceeded to call me on every stupid ass thing I've done this
summer." Brooke sat down on the bed next to her. </p>
<p>"What did you do?" she asked still clueless as to Sam's behavior. Sam sighed
and turned her head towards Brooke. </p>
<p>"I didn't get what I wanted to so I hurt you, pushed away and ran off. He's
right, I'm a spoiled brat," she complained. Brooke started to gently rub circles
along Sam's back, surprised at how tense Sam was. </p>
<p>"You're not a 'spoiled brat', Sammy. For whatever reason, you were hurt and
reacted to that. It's hardly fair to hold that against you forever." </p>
<p>"You wouldn't say that if you remembered what I did," Sam scoffed bitterly.
Brooke frowned but said nothing. She dug her fingers deeper into Sam's shoulders
massaging the balls of tension she felt there. She heard Sam groan lowly. </p>
<p>"God, Sammy, you are so tense," she pointed out as she continued. She could
feel Sam's muscles relaxing a little under her fingers. "Did Harrison do this to
you?" Sam laughed softly. </p>
<p>"Nah," she whispered. "I'm always like that." </p>
<p>"Why?" Brooke asked concerned. It bothered her to think that Sam carried so
much on her shoulders needlessly. </p>
<p>"I dunno," Sam sighed sleepily as she started to doze off. "I just am." She
was so emotionally spent from her outing with Harrison that she didn't even have
the energy to contemplate what Brooke was doing. All she knew was that she felt
more relaxed and content than she had in a long time. She felt herself fall
asleep as Brooke's hands kneaded the muscles at the base of her neck. </p>
<p>Brooke watched as Sam fell asleep under her hands and smiled. She loved the
fact that Sam trusted her so much. She rubbed Sam's back until the last kink was
out and then crawled into bed with her, throwing the covers up over them both.
