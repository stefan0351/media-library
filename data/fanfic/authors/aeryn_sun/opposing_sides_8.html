<!-- Opposing Sides \ Chapter 8 -->

<p>Brooke ran her hands up and down Sam's silky soft legs as she still stayed kneeling in front of the brunette. She could feel Sam's legs trembling slightly beneath her touch and she loved knowing that Sam wanted this as much as she did. She massaged Sam's thighs slightly, pausing just below the patch of curly hair at Sam's core. She looked up to check on Sam again and found the journalist watching her, her brown hair plastered in tendrils to her face and her eyes dark with desire. The look of want and need in those eyes made Brooke dizzy. Silently she stood back up and faced Sam.</p>
<p>Unable to stand being still any longer, Sam wrapped her arm around Brooke's neck as soon as she stood up and crushed their lips together. She licked Brooke's soft bottom lip, not asking for entry but demanding it. Brooke willingly and gladly complied. For several long minutes their tongues dueled and tasted each other; giving, taking, learning and exploring. Sam felt Brooke moan into her mouth as her hands traveled to cup the blonde's ass. She racked her nails over the skin on Brooke's back and rear, earning herself another moan of pleasure.</p>
<p>Pressing forward, Sam pinned Brooke to the shower stall and smiled as Brooke's body squeaked against it. Breaking away from Brooke's mouth, Sam rained kisses and nips along the cheerleaders jawline, to her ear, and then down her neck listening to the pants and whimpers coming continuously from the back of the other girl's throat. Her hands wandered up to play with Brooke's breasts, teasing the already taunt nipples and causing Brooke to arch into her hands. A low moan escaped Brooke as Sam licked and then sucked one erect bud into her mouth. </p>
<p>She buried her hands in Sam's hair, massaging her scalp as she worked. Brooke closed her eyes as she gave in to the sensations Sam was causing throughout her body. While she knew it was really happening, a small part of Brooke's mind was waiting for the alarm to go off and wake her from this watery Heaven. But it didn't. </p>
<p>Sam let her hands rest on Brooke's hips for a second as she stood up to face Brooke again. She wanted to give the blonde one last chance to change her mind. When her motions stopped, Brooke's eyes snapped open and focused on her. Those hazel eyes, clouded over with lust and love gave Sam all the answer she needed. She smiled sensually at Brooke and leaned in to kiss her lips as she slid one finger deep within Brooke's center. She swallowed the gasp and cry of pleasure that erupted from Brooke. </p>
<p>Pinned against the wall as she was, all Brooke could do was rock against Sam's hand and pray that her legs would hold her. She held on to Sam's hips and rested her forehead against Sam's shoulder as the other girl gently thrust her finger within her and then added another. Brooke shuddered at the feel of Sam inside her. When Sam's thumb pressed against her clit, Brooke felt her legs almost give out. She knew that without Sam holding her up and the wall behind her, she's be on the floor of the tub by now.</p>
<p>Sam listened to the gasps and moans coming from Brooke's mouth beside her ear. They were the sweetest things she'd ever heard, another woman's pleasure and she wanted to hear more. She pressed harder against Brooke's clit and won herself a loud cry from Brooke. Smiling into the wet hair beside her face, she started to thrust faster and harder while simultaneously grinding her own center into Brooke's hip that was situated between her thighs. She wanted her own release as badly as she wanted Brooke's. </p>
<p>Finally, with a loud shout, Brooke began to clench around Sam's fingers as she came. She mumbled Sam's name over and over as the waves of ecstasy washed through her. Hearing her name coming from Brooke, dripping with love and pleasure sent Sam over the edge and she too came with a low guttural moan. Slowly they both sank to the floor of the tub with Sam lying on the bottom and Brooke on top of her. The hot water still ran over their bodies as they lay panting in each other's arms. It had long ran cold by the time they unwrapped themselves from their embrace and left the shower for one of the adjoining bedrooms.</p>
