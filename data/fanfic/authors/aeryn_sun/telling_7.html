<!-- Telling Series \ Section 3: Harrison - One Potato Two Potato Three Potato Four -->

<p>"So, who's next on our little `move out of the way of the closet door lest
you be smacked in the face with it' list?" Sam asked cheerfully, a little too
cheerfully for Brooke's taste at breakfast a few days after they informed Lily
and Josh of their relationship. And as Lily had said, Josh was fine, once the
shock wore off and neither friend had told another soul of what was confessed
that night. It went to show Sam and Brooke just what good friends Josh and Lily
actually were. They both took comfort in the fact that even if all their other
friends reacted badly, at least Lily and Josh would still be there. Brooke
regarded Sam carefully over the lid of her vanilla yogart. </p>
<p>"Where do you come up with some of this stuff Sam? Do you stand in front of
the mirror and practice or what? You can be highly annoying sometimes and I
don't even think you realize it," she said snottily. Sam looked at her in mild
surprise and then looked at the calender and smirked. Without saying a word, she
walked to the cabinet, took out a bottle and handed it to Brooke. </p>
<p>"Take two and talk to me again in twenty minutes," she prescribed calmly,
grabbed a bottle of water, half a sandwich and headed out the door after placing
a quick peck on Brooke's cheek. Brooke was about to snap back when she looked at
the label on the bottle. After squelching the urge to put her head in the
blender, Brooke did as Sam suggested. After all, two Midol never hurt anyone,
did they? </p>
<p align="center">**</p>
<p>Brooke caught up with Sam at her locker a little while later, sheepish smile
on her face. Sam just smiled back. </p>
<p>"Feeling better, Princess?" she asked, enjoying the embarrassed look on
Brooke's face. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Yeah, sorry, didn't mean to take my PMS out on you," she apologized. Sam
shrugged. </p>
<p>"Eh, don't worry about it. Now, manic episode aside, give any thought to my
question this morning?" Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"Not really. I still want to hold off on Nicole. She's one of the last people
I want to tell, aside from Dad, for obvious reasons. I don't think we'd have
half the sentence out before she'll have flyers posted around the school
declaring our sexual preference." Sam crinkled her nose. </p>
<p>"Oh, I can see it now: McQueen/McPherson Love Nest or Live-In Lesbian
Stepsisters. No, wait, giving Nic way too much credit. Besides, that's more Mary
Cherry's schtick than Nic's. And you never know, Nic might take it well," Sam
offered. Brooke laughed sarcastically. </p>
<p>"Only because she'll see it as an opportunity to steal my throne out from
underneath me. Can you see her as Queen of Kennedy High?" Images of Nic on a
golden throne with the poor hapless students bowing and kissing her Prada clad
feet, declaring their undying loyalty while she ordered their heads cut off for
being uncool or out of fashion flashed through Sam's brain. It wasn't a pretty
visual. Sam shook her head to get rid of it. </p>
<p>"Ew, don't do that. OK, that eliminates Nicole for now. And Mary Cherry, just
for the whole, I-got-a-big-Southern-Mouth thing she's got going. Now, SHE'D put
posters up. Only they'd be hideously tacky ones." Brooke laughed again and shook
her head in agreement. </p>
<p>"OK, that leaves us with Carmen, Sugar, and Harrison," she said. They both
thought about that one. </p>
<p>"Carmen is away at her uncle's remember? She won't be back for at least
another week. Sugar Daddy can't keep a secret to save his life. That leaves
Harrison and after the way he totally freaked when he found out about his
mother, I'm not sure I want to tell him," Sam pointed out, a hint of worry
creeping into her voice. "We can always wait for Carm to get home." Brooke shook
her head. </p>
<p>"No, we have to do this, Sam. I hate lying to everyone. I'm not ashamed of
you, of us and I don't want to have to hide it. It's stressful and tiring. I
know Harrison probably isn't going to take it well. Heck, he's had a thing for
the both of us forever and this is seriously going to wound his pride and his
ego," Brooke emphasized. Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"I know. It's just, he's been a good friend for so long that I hate to lose
him," she said quietly. Wanting nothing more than to wrap her girlfriend in a
giant comforting hug but knowing the hallway at school wasn't the best place to
do it, Brooke settled for putting a reassuring hand on Sam's shoulder. </p>
<p>"I understand and feel the same way, but either he finds out from us or
someone else lets it slip and he really freaks out because we didn't tell him,"
she explained patiently. Sam nodded, knowing Brooke was right. "Tell you what,
why don't we invite Harrison over for dinner since Mom will be home late and Dad
is away at Gramps with Mac {A/N: are those two EVER home?} and tell him then? At
least it's not a public place and he's free to leave at anytime." </p>
<p>"OK," Sam agreed half-heartedly. "You know this isn't going to go over well?" </p>
<p>"Like a lead balloon," Brooke conceeded. She shrugged. "You never know, maybe
having to deal with his mother's homosexuality has made him more openminded."
Sam scoffed. </p>
<p>"Yeah," she mumbled. "And monkeys might fly out of my butt." Brooke looked up
and down the hallway to make sure they were alone and then spanked Sam on the
ass. </p>
<p>"God, I hope not." </p>
