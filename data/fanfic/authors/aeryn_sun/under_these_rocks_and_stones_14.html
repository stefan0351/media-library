<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Parental Agony -->

<p>"They actually took you to therapy?" Nic asked the next day as
she sat with Lily on the couch in Sam and Brooke's room. It had become the
unoffical-gathering place for them. It provided a safe place for all of them to
get away from their parents and since both Gayle and Maria were on Nicole and
Lily's cases again, neither girl had any interest in being home. Sam lift her
head from where it was resting on Brooke's abdomen and laughed bitterly.
</p>
<p>"Yeah, ya should have seen it. `You're not gay because I won't
allow it.' Like Mike had any control over it," her voice held no humor. Brooke
reached out and stroked Sam's hair in comfort. </p>
<p>"And they were going to send you away, Sam?" Lily asked still
in shock over that part. She couldn't believe that a parent would willingly want
to send a child away simply because they didn't agree with who they loved. It
was ludicrous to her. And yet sadly, she knew it was a harsh reality that
happened everyday. </p>
<p>"We let them know on no uncertain terms that was not an
option," Brooke said bitterly as Sam set her head back down. Sam laughed.
</p>
<p>"You should have heard this one," she said indicating Brooke.
"She went up one side of them and down the other. I bet they still have heel
marks on their backs," she giggled. The other girls laughed with her. It was a
welcome respite from the tension the situation was pressing down on them.
</p>
<p>"Unleashed your inner bitch, did ya, B?" Nic asked. Brooke
blushed. </p>
<p>"I opened my mouth and it all just kinda spilled out," she
admitted. </p>
<p>"I don't think they were expecting such a strong argument to
come from you, Brooke. Did you see the looks on their faces? And what was up
with the therapist? Someone should really buy that man a clue," Sam joked.
Brooke laughed. </p>
<p>"He was SO in over his head he couldn't see daylight," she
agreed. "But still," she added more seriously, "the thought of them sending you
away scared me, Sammy." </p>
<p>"Me too," Sam said quietly. </p>
<p>"I would have totally flipped if someone tried to take Lily
from me," Nic said as she hugged Lily a little closer. Lily smiled and settled
closer. </p>
<p>"Ditto," she said. </p>
<p>"Well, we're a pathetic foursome," Nicole muttered. "So
whipped we can't see straight. Wait, maybe `straight' was the wrong word to
use." Everyone snickered. </p>
<p>"Never thought I'd see the day when Nicole Julian would be
whipped," Sam said from the bed. Nicole sent her a glare. </p>
<p>"Why? Because I don't have a heart?" she snapped. Sam put her
hands up in defense. </p>
<p>"Hold up, don't get your panties, if you wear any, in a twist.
All I meant was I didn't think there was anyone who could match you for attitude
or put up with yours. God knows I couldn't," she clarified. The angry look on
Nicole's face faded. </p>
<p>"Well, first off, I do wear panties," she said. She heard Lily
giggle slightly beside her and elbowed her gently. "Don't help, Lil," she
whispered. </p>
<p>"Second," Nicole continued louder, "I never thought anyone
could ever put up with me either, Spa?Sam. But I'm beyond happy that Lily can." </p>
<p>"Lord knows it's a task sometimes," Lily sighed dramatically.
Nicole rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Gee, thanks," she muttered. Brooke pulled Sam up so that they
were laying side by side. </p>
<p>"Why do you bait her like that?" she asked Sam in a whisper.
Sam smiled wickedly at her. </p>
<p>"Like what?" she asked innocently. Brooke rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Sam?" she warned. Sam chuckled. </p>
<p>"Cuz it's fun," Sam told her. Brooke just shook her head. </p>
<p>"You're horrible," she accused softly with a smile on her
face. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Yup." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The phone started ringing at an obnoxiously early time the
next morning and Sam thought it should be illegal for a phone to ring before
noon on a Saturday. She heard Brooke mumble a swear at the offending object but
make no move to answer. Finally unable to stand it anymore, Sam rolled over to
answer it. </p>
<p>"What?" she barked into the receiver. </p>
<p>"Sam?" her mother's voice asked. The last vestiges of sleep
flew from Sam's mind at the sound of her mother's voice. </p>
<p>"Mom?" she answered confused. "What's up?" </p>
<p>"I didn't mean to wake you but you said that if I wanted to
try the therapy thing again that you would," she said hastily. Sam rolled her
eyes. </p>
<p>"This isn't a ploy to whisk me off to New Zealand or something
is it?" she questioned suspiciously although she heard New Zealand was a nice
place. (=D) </p>
<p>"No, Sam," her mother sighed. "Although I deserved that. No, I
genuinely want to try therapy again." </p>
<p>"What about Mike?" </p>
<p>"Him too. And he won't touch you again, Sam. He feels real bad
about that," Jane explained. Sam winced at the memory of Mike accidently
grabbing her injured arm. </p>
<p>"Yeah, he should," she said bitterly. "Let me know when and
where and I'll talk it over with Brooke." Her mother gave her the time the
following Monday and again pleaded with her to give it another try. Sam hung up
the phone without agreeing or disagreeing to go. Brooke rolled over to face her. </p>
<p>"More therapy?" she asked Sam. Sam nodded her head.
</p>
<p>"Parentals want to go for round two." Brooke sighed.
</p>
<p>"I don't know if I've got round two in me," she told Sam. Sam
looked at her sadly. </p>
<p>"Me either, love. We've got two days to decide. Until then,"
she said as a smirk crept onto her face. "Let's enjoy our time together."
</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Despite misgivings and a general unease about the whole idea,
again Sam and Brooke found themselves in front of door 203 the following Monday.
Grasping tightly to one another's hands, they opened the door and headed to Dr.
Snowe's office. To their total surprise, along with their parents and Frank this
time were Nicole and Lily, and Gayle and Maria. Nicole and Lily looked
despondent. </p>
<p>"Oh, this ain't good," Sam breathed. Brooke shook her head
slowly. </p>
<p>"This is very very bad," she added. Frank stood up to greet
them. </p>
<p>"Girls, have a seat. We were just welcoming Gayle, Maria,
Nicole and Lily," he said with that patronizing tone some therapists use when
they think they've got one up on their patients. Reluctantly Sam and Brooke sat
down. Sam sent her mother a glare than could have melted through titanium. Jane
looked away ashamed. </p>
<p>"Sam, I swear, I didn't know," Jane said in a whisper. And for
some reason, Sam believed her. </p>
<p>"So what's this, Frank? Giving a cut rate for three or more?"
Sam asked sarcastically turning her attention away from her mother. "Bring in
three lesbians and the fourth is free?" </p>
<p>"Sam!" Jane scolded. Sam heard the three other girls her own
age try desperately to stifle a severe case of the giggles and smiled a self-satisified
smile. </p>
<p>"Wipe that look off your face, young lady," Gayle ordered. Sam
arched an eyebrow and tilted her head. </p>
<p>"You're supposed to ride the broomstick, not shove it up your
ass," Sam countered calmly. There was no way she was making this easy. Besides,
she was in a rare mood today. She watched, pleasantly satisfied as Gayle turned
purple and Nicole burst out laughing unable to help herself. </p>
<p>"Sam, I think that's enough," Frank said evenly trying to
regain control. Sam fixed her stare on him. </p>
<p>"Really?" she asked. "Let me tell you what I think, Frank. I
think you're a laughing stock to the psychiatric community. What kind of
licensed therapist lets parents ambush their children in ways that can
undoubtedly scar them emotionally for life?" </p>
<p>"What can emotionally scar our children is this depraved and
sick behavior the four of you are indulging in," Maria Esposito broke in.
</p>
<p>"How is love sick, Mama?" Lily asked. Maria glared at her. </p>
<p>"What you are feeling isn't love, Lily," her mother argued.
Lily's eyes narrowed. </p>
<p>"How would you know?" she growled. Maria started yelling at
her in Spanish. Lily raised her hands. "English, Mama! In English, please. If
you're going to rip me apart at least do it so everyone can understand."
</p>
<p>"I know," Maria restarted in a dangerously low voice. "Because
you can not possibly love that girl," she pointed disgustedly at Nicole who
stuck out her tongue at her. "You can not be gay." Lily folded her arms across
her chest. </p>
<p>"And just why is that? Because you don't want me to be?" Lily
asked her mother. Maria shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, because all four of you can not be gay," Maria said as if
that logically explained it all away. The four girls in question exchanged
amused glances. Lily looked at Nicole. </p>
<p>"Well, I'm gay, I know that. How about you, Niki?" Nicole
nodded. </p>
<p>"As a rainbow," Nicole agreed. "I'm talking Elton John gay."
She turned to Brooke. "How about you Brookie?" Brooke grinned. </p>
<p>"Queer as Liberace," she added. "I mean Indigo Girls and Queer
as Folk gay. Sammy?" Sam looked thoughful for a second. </p>
<p>"Hell yeah," she added a second later. "I hear Melissa
Etheridge is gonna play in the area soon, who wants to go?" Three hands, two
belonging to the cheerleaders and the other to the school activist, shot in the
air. "Yeah, I'm gay too," Sam added, just in case the adults missed it. "What
are you gonna do now? Send us all away for our own version of `But I'm a
Cheerleader'? At least it'd fit for two of us." </p>
<p>"Could you be serious for one second here, Sam?" Mike asked
angrily. Sam looked at him. </p>
<p>"Mike, do you realize how outrageous this situation is?" she
shot back at him. "Because the four of you can't deal with the four of us,
you've cornered us in a therapist's office. A therapist, who, I might add, never
SAYS JACK!" she shouted at Frank who jumped. Gayle shot up out of her chair and
grabbed Nicole's arm. </p>
<p>"That's it, you're going to live in a bording school
overseas," she declared. Nicole dug her heels into the floor and tried to pull
away. Lily grabbed her other arm and pulled in the other direction. To everyone
else in the room, Nic resembled a demented version of a turkey's wishbone. Maria
got up and grabbed a hold of Lily and tried to pry her off of Nicole.
</p>
<p>"Get away from her," Maria ordered. Lily shook her mother off. </p>
<p>"You're not taking her anywhere you harpy!" Lily screamed at
Gayle. Poor Nicole was stuck in the middle looking lost. </p>
<p>"ENOUGH!" Brooke yelled standing up. Everyone stopped what
they were doing and focused on her. She marched over and slapped Gayle straight
across the face shocking everyone, even Sam. Gayle let go of Nicole suddenly
sending her sprawling into Lily and them both to the floor. </p>
<p>"You little bitch," Gayle hissed at Brooke. Brooke glared back
at her. </p>
<p>"Got your attention, didn't it?" Brooke asked lowly. She
stepped back out of Gayle's reach and made sure she still had everyone's
attention. </p>
<p>"This is utterly ridiculous," she announced. "Listen up,
because these are the facts: the four of us, me, Sam, Lily, and Nicole are gay.
Homosexual. Lesbians. Queer. There are a million things to call it, pick one and
go with it, I don't care. But this behavior from you, our parents, stops here
and now." Sam, Lily and Nicole, sensing that this was indeed the end of the line
for their parents, stood up and joined Brooke where she stood in the middle of
the room. </p>
<p>"You have a few choices now," Brooke continued slipping her
hand into Sam's warm waiting one. "Either accept us and love us, because we are
at heart the same four girls you raised and have always known. Or, and I hate
this option, leave us the Hell alone." She let out a long sigh. </p>
<p>"You're our parents and we love you. We'd never want to hurt
you. We didn't do this to hurt you, honest. But this is who we are. If we can
accept it, why can't you?" </p>
<p>"Because it's wrong Brooke," Mike interrupted. Brooke rolled
her eyes at him. </p>
<p>"In who's eyes, Dad? Yours? God's? I don't believe that God
would ever create anything like what I feel for Sam and then turn around and
have it be wrong. What I feel, this love for her is too pure and right to be
wrong," she explained quietly but with strength in her voice. She felt Sam
squeeze her hand and squeezed back. </p>
<p>"There are places that can help the four of you," Frank
started. </p>
<p>"Save it," Sam cut him off with a wave of her hand. "We don't
need `help', all we need is one another." Without another word, the four girls
turned and left their parents in a silent stupor. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>They continued to sit in silence in Sam and Brooke's room for
a good two hours. No one had anything to say. The whole experience seemed
surreal and they all feared the repercussions. At any moment any one of their
parents could come through that door and whisk one of them away and logically
they knew there was nothing they could do to stop them. </p>
<p>"We have to leave," Lily said suddenly. Everyone looked at her
in confusion. </p>
<p>"Huh?" Sam managed. </p>
<p>"The four of us, I mean. We can't stay here, they're going to
try to separate at least one set of us and we can't let that happen," Lily
explained. The other girls knew that sadly, she had a point. </p>
<p>"I hate the idea of running away, literally and figuratively,"
Brooke pointed out. </p>
<p>"So do I, Brooke," Sam said as she hugged Brooke to her. "But
maybe if we do this they'll come to their senses." Nic laughed. </p>
<p>"Well maybe your parents will but my mom has no sense so she's
out of the equation," Nic joked weakly. She turned to Lily. "You really want to
do this?" Lily nodded. "Then pack up your stuff, ladies, it's time for a road
trip." </p>
