<!-- High School Hell \ One Quiet Moment -->

<p>Brooke came home from school the next night, late from Glamazon practice and headed up to her room. It had been a horrible day. There had been a pop qiz in Chem she was unprepared for, a fight with Nic and Mary Cherry over whether or not she was going to the Senior Prom (undecided), a few altercations with the remaining homophobic section of the school population, she spilled ketchup on herself at lunch and had seen very little Sam. Not that Sam was avoiding her; their schedules just didn't gel that day. </p>
<p>So she trudged up the stairs feeling defeated and surly. She stopped at the top of the stairs in confusion. On the floor was a carpet of rose pedals leading to her room. A bright smile lit her face as she guessed the culprit behind the surprise. She kicked off her shoes and reveled in the soft velvety feel of the petals on her feet. She followed the path and slowly opened her bedroom door. </p>
<p>Her room was filled with flowers of all types, colors and sizes. Roses, carnations, daisies, you name it it was probably there and it took Brooke's breath away. On top of that were the candles softly illuminating the room and Sam standing in the middle holding a single long stemmed red rose. Brooke slowly approached her and Sam smiled shyly. </p>
<p>"Hi," she whispered. Brooke tilted her head. </p>
<p>"Hi," she responded. "What's all this?" she asked quietly motioning around the room. Sam looked down a second and then back up into Brooke's sparkling hazel eyes. </p>
<p>"An apology," she started. "For being such an ass. And a Valentine, a birthday, a Christmas, an I love you, and a just because." Brooke smirked. </p>
<p>"A just because?" Sam smirked back at her. </p>
<p>"Just because I can. And just because I love you. It's also my pathetic attempt at seducing you," she added coyly. Brooke smiled wolfishly.</p>
<p>"Not at all pathetic," she said huskily as she pulled Sam into a heated kiss. Sam returned the smile after they parted. </p>
<p>"I'm glad to know the effort wasn't wasted," she joked. Brooke took the rose from her and placed it on the nightstand before leading Sam to the bed. </p>
<p>"I love you, Sammy," Brooke said softly. She shivered at their close contact. "It's been so long." Sam reached up and cupped Brooke's face with her palms. </p>
<p>"I know, Princess. And I'm sorry. We have a lot of time to make up for," she whispered as she leaned in for another kiss. "And I plan on making every moment count from here on out." </p>
