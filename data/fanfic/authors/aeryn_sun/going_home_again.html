<p>"Brooke, are you sure about this?" Sam asked for the tenth
time in the last hour as she and Brooke sat waiting for her flight.
Brooke ran her fingers through Sam's curly mane to calm her and gave
her a quick kiss on the nose.</p>

<p>"Yes, love.  There's no reason why both of us should have to
miss Mac's party," she whispered, nuzzling Sam's cheek and inhaling
her scent.  It was vaguely like the herbal shampoo she used with a
hint of something else uniquely Sam and Brooke loved it.</p>

<p>"I know, but we both should be there.  I feel bad that you're
going to miss it," Sam complained wrapping her arms around her
longtime girlfriend.  If you had told her in her junior year of high
school that she would become involved long term with Brooke McQueen,
after punching you in the nose, Sam would have laughed you off of the
planet.  And yet here she was, several years later, deeply in love
with the blonde and loved just as much in return.</p>

<p>It all came down to the night of the Junior Prom when Nicole
had tried to run Brooke down with her car.  Sam had tried to save
Brooke from the oncoming vehicle but they'd both been hurt instead.
Their recovery had been long and painful but because it was a shared
experience, they'd grown closer.  And Sam had found that her feelings
for Brooke were getting deeper and out of control.  Finally after
months of rehabilitation, she'd confessed her feelings to the
blonde.  To her surprise and relief, Brooke returned those feelings
whole heartedly but had been afraid to say anything.  They'd been
together ever since.</p>

<p>"I really wish you could come with me," Sam sighed.  Brooke
held her a little closer.</p>

<p>"Me too, Sammy.  But I have finals and I can't miss them.
And it's only for two weeks.  We both knew med school was going to be
tough for me and that we were going to have to make sacrifices.  This
is one of them," Brooke explained.</p>

<p>"Then I won't go either," Sam suggested.  Brooke shook her
head.</p>

<p>"You'll break little Mac's heart if you're not there, Sam.
She loves you and is already upset enough that I'm missing the
party.  It's not everyday that you turn seven."</p>

<p>"I guess," Sam said defeated.  She really wanted Brooke to go
with her.  She hated being apart from the blonde for too long and the
thought of being in California with the family while Brooke was in
New York at school was depressing.</p>

<p>"FLIGHT 467, NEW YORK TO LOS ANGELES NOW BOARDING AT GATE
12," a booming voice announced.  Sam glanced at her ticket and then
up at the gate.</p>

<p>"That's you, love," Brooke pointed out.  There was a hint of
sadness in her tone that was making leaving even harder for Sam.
They both stood up and walked closer to the gate.</p>

<p>"I wish I could stay and help you study for your tests," Sam
said, grasping Brooke's hand tightly.  Brooke smiled at her.</p>

<p>"I wish you could too.  You're a great study buddy," she
joked.  "But I'll do fine.  The femur's connected to the sternum and
when in question, the answer is C, right?" she asked cheekily.  Sam
pretended to act horrified.</p>

<p>"Damn, I'm glad you weren't my orthopedic or neurosurgeon,
honey.  If you had reconnected my femur to my sternum, well, that's
not a pretty picture."</p>

<p>"Oh, you know I'm kidding, Sammy," Brooke swatted her on the
shoulder.  Sam snickered.</p>

<p>"I don't know, you ARE a natural blonde." Brooke mock frowned
at her.</p>

<p>"Keep that up and you'll be coming home to a very cold bed,
love," she threatened.  Sam pouted.</p>

<p>"Sowwee," she said chastised.  Brooke seized the pouting lips
in a deep kiss, making Sam sigh in happiness.</p>

<p>"Forgiven," Brooke said after she released Sam.  "You'd
better board or I may never let you go."</p>

<p>"OK," Sam said resigned.</p>

<p>"You remembered to pack my gifts for the runt?" Brooke double
checked.  Sam nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, they're in my suitcase.  She's going to love them.  I'm
really going to miss you," Sam finished, bowing her head.  Brooke
crooked her finger under Sam's chin and lifted the brunette's head.
She wiped away the few errant tears that had fallen.</p>

<p>"I'll miss you too, Sammy.  I love you.  To the moon and
back," she said, kissing Sam again.</p>

<p>"To the moon and back," Sam echoed.</p>

<hr>

<p>The flight was long and boring, especially without Brooke to
share it with.  All Sam could think about was the beautiful and
loving woman she'd left in New York.  She knew that her little sister
was excited about her visit and Sam herself was happy that she was
going to be seeing her family but she couldn't help regretting
Brooke's absence.</p>

<p>&lt;Damn finals had to run long&gt; she sighed internally.  &lt;And
she couldn't get any coverage for her shifts at the hospital.  Now
that was just wrong.  She covers everyone else.  Why can't someone
else return the favor once in a while?&gt;  </p>

<p>Sam turned her head and stared out the dark window, seeing
nothing but the wing of the plane as she thought.</p>

<p>&lt;She works all the holidays, double shifts, covers for
birthdays and emergencies, weekends...sometimes she doesn't get
enough sleep.  I know it's what she wants to do but I worry about
her.  I don't want her to burn out before she hits 30&gt; Sam sighed
again, this time out loud.  The gentleman beside her glared at her
and shifted away.  Sam resisted the urge to stick her tongue out at
him.</p>

<p>&lt;Now now Sam&gt; she heard Brooke's soothing voice in her mind.
&lt;Can't have an award winning journalist making faces at passengers on
airplanes now can we?  What would people say?&gt; She snickered earning
herself another glare.  She rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>&lt;Ah, the human condition.  I hate people&gt; she decided not for
the first time.  She picked up the in flight phone and after typing
in her card number, dialed the comforting and familiar number.</p>

<p>"Hullo...?" came the slightly groggy response.  Sam checked
her watch and realized that she's woken Brooke up.</p>

<p>"Shit, honey, I'm sorry," she said softly.  She heard a soft
sleep filled chuckle.</p>

<p>"S'OK, I'm sleeping next to the phone waiting for you,"
Brooke said and Sam could hear the smile in her voice.</p>

<p>"I wanted to hear your voice," Sam whispered to her.  She
glanced at the man next to her whom she could tell was
eavesdropping.  "So, hot stuff, whatcha wearing?  That sexy black see-
through teddy I gave you for Valentine's or nothing at all?"</p>

<p>"SAM!" Brooke laughed, more awake now.  Sam giggled as the
man blushed and cleared his throat.  "Got another winner next to you
on the plane?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yup."</p>

<p>"God, Sam, you're a magnet," Brooke teased. "So where are you
now?"</p>

<p>"I dunno, somewhere over middle America I would assume.  I
miss you so much already," she confessed.</p>

<p>"Same here, love," Brooke said. "I miss your touch, your
scent, your kisses everywhere on me..."</p>

<p>"God, Brooke," Sam groaned.  "That's not fair." She heard
Brooke laugh again.</p>

<p>"Not fair to you but fun for me," Brooke teased.</p>

<p>"I wish I was home with you," Sam nearly whined.</p>

<p>"Two weeks, Sam.  It's not the end of the world." Sam sighed
heavily.</p>

<p>"Two weeks too long, sweetheart.  How'd today go?"</p>

<p>"Fast but good.  I think I aced my chemistry final," Brooke
chirped happily.</p>

<p>"That's fantastic, Brooke.  I'm proud of you," Sam beamed.</p>

<p>"Be proud when the grades come back in a few weeks, Sam.
Then we'll know for sure," Brooke warned cautiously.  "Tomorrow it's
anatomy."</p>

<p>"You should ace that one too," Sam purred suggestively.</p>

<p>"Ha ha, you perv.  Seriously, though, I love you, my Sammy,"
Brooke told her lovingly.</p>

<p>"I love you too, Brooke.  Mine always." </p>

<hr>

<p>"SAMMY!" the small ball of energy barreled for the door and
plowed into Sam as she walked into the house.  All she saw before it
collided with her was a flash of long light brown hair pulled back in
a ponytail and then the small child was wrapped around her waist.</p>

<p>"You're here!  You came!" Mac yelled excitedly as she hugged
Sam so hard Sam was afraid her ribs were going to be bruised.</p>

<p>"Of course I did, runt.  Can't miss my favorite baby sister's
birthday now can I?" Sam asked as she hugged her sister back.  Mac
grinned up at her showing off the gap in her teeth proudly.  The
child's eyes were very much like her sister Brooke's, hazel, although
slightly more green.  It reminded her of her missing lover and she
felt a pang of hurt.  </p>

<p>"Sammy, I'm your ONLY baby sister," Mac pointed out as only a
child can.  Sam laughed.</p>

<p>"She's got you there," Jane said as she walked into the room
holding two year old Peter, Sam and Brooke's little brother.  Now HE
was a surprise.  She walked over and gave her oldest daughter a kiss
on the cheek.</p>

<p>"Hey Mom," Sam smiled.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you're home, honey.  I just wish Brooke could've
made it," Jane said.  Sam sighed as Mac grabbed her hand.</p>

<p>"Yeah, Mom, me too." She looked down as Mac tugged on her
hand.</p>

<p>"Brooke's gonna call, right, Sammy?" Mac asked
innocently.  "Cuz she promised she would."</p>

<p>"Of course she will, Mackie.  She said she'd call on your
birthday and that's in two days.  You know Brooke always keeps her
promises," Sam assured the little brunette.</p>

<p>"Lelmo!" Peter blurted out.  Sam looked at the toddler
stupefied.</p>

<p>"He's obsessed with Elmo," Jane explained. "It's the only
thing he'll say.  That and 'No.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, OK," Sam said.  She leaned down to Mac. "He must get
that stubborn streak from Brooke's side of the family." Mac giggled.</p>

<p>"Come on, Sammy, I wanna show you my room!" Mac said happily,
yanking on Sam's hand.</p>

<p>"Lead the way, Mac."</p>

<hr>

<p>"Thank you for the CDs Brooke, I love them," Mac chirped into
the phone as Sam listened two days later.  As promised, Brooke called
as scheduled.  In between that time, Sam had talked to her every
night but this call was especially for Mac. "And the Barbie and the
clothes and...and...the paint set," she finished.  Sam laughed to
herself.</p>

<p>&lt;No wonder my suitcase was so heavy.  There was no clothes in
it, only stuff for Mac&gt;</p>

<p>"When are you coming to visit?  This summer?  GREAT!  Sammy
too?  Both of you?  SUPER!" Mac talked excitedly as Sam watched.
Soon, though, the youngster yawned.</p>

<p>"I think it's past your bedtime, kiddo," Sam said.  Mac
frowned.</p>

<p>"Aw, do I hafta?" she whined.</p>

<p>"Want some cheese to go with that whine?" Sam asked.  At Mac
confused look, Sam nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, go brush your teeth and get ready for bed.  Mom will
tuck you in soon."</p>

<p>"I hafta go Brooke.  I love you.  Visit soon.  Here's Sammy,"
she handed the phone to Sam. "Come read me a story, Sammy?" Sam
nodded.</p>

<p>"Soon, I promise," Sam said.  Mac smiled and hopped out of
her chair.</p>

<p>"'K," she said as she scampered off.</p>

<p>"Hey babe," Sam purred into the phone.</p>

<p>"Hey yourself," Brooke answered. "How've you been?"</p>

<p>"Lonely," Sam responded honestly.</p>

<p>"Me too."</p>

<p>"How're your finals going?" Sam asked.</p>

<p>"Not bad actually.  And work is good too, I've been able to
get some sleep recently," Brooke joked.  Sam chuckled.</p>

<p>"That's good.  Boy, as much as I want to talk to you, this is
going to kill our phone bill," she lamented.  Brooke sighed and then
giggled.</p>

<p>"We'll survive.  But," Brooke yawned, "I do have to get to
bed.  The time difference is a bear and I need some sleep.  Talk to
you tomorrow?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Of course," Sam said. "You needn't even ask.  I love you,
Brooke."</p>

<p>"I love you too, Sammy."</p>

<hr>

<p>Sam sat in the kitchen for a while after reading a story to
Mac and putting her to sleep.  It was still early her time and she
wasn't tired enough to sleep.  As much as she was enjoying the visit
with her mother and sister, as well as Mike and the new baby, she was
still counting down the days until she went home to Brooke.</p>

<p>"Sam?" Jane called from the doorway making Sam jump
slightly. "You have company." Sam looked up to see Lily and Harrison
walk in.  She greeted then with huge hugs.</p>

<p>"Hey, guys, what's up?" she asked.</p>

<p>"We heard you were in town and might need cheering up so
we're here to take you out clubbing," Lily said cheerfully.  Sam
rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>"Brooke?" she asked already knowing the answer.  Harrison
laughed.</p>

<p>"Yes, she's called all of us and told us not to let you mope
around and to make you have fun.  So grab your jacket, Samantha
McPherson, you're going out to have a good time if it kills you," he
informed her.  Sam groaned.</p>

<p>"Oh joy."</p>

<hr>

<p>They ended up in a small club outside town with almost all
their old friends.  Carmen, Sugar Daddy and Josh had met them there.
Naturally Nicole wasn't welcome.  After the accident, the former
cheerleader went through rehab and then a short stint in a
psychiatric facility before her mother shipped her off to parts
unknown.  Last anyone heard she was working as a designer in Milan.
And Mary Cherry was currently learning the ropes of her mother's
enterprise in Texas.</p>

<p>After a few hours and a few drinks, the conversation turned a
bit more personal.  Carmen asked Sam how her relationship with Brooke
was doing and suddenly the journalist was calling upon all her
knowledge as a writer to try and put into words the depth of what she
felt for the absent blonde.</p>

<p>"God, Carm, if you only knew, and could understand," the few
beers and shots Sam had had were slightly effecting her thought
processes. "I love her SO much.  But I don't think she understands or
knows how much.  And she is doing so good at college.  God, a
doctor.  She's going to be a doctor!  Can you believe that?  I mean,
I can because she's so smart.  But I mean, really.  She's so
beautiful and so smart and she's really going to go through with it.
She's going to be a great doctor.  Did I tell you she's decided to go
with Ped's as her specialty?  She's great with kids.  I hope we have
some someday, biological hurdles aside," she said with a wink.</p>

<p>"Wow, Sam, sounds like you two are doing great," Lily piped
up with a small smile.  Sam smiled back.</p>

<p>"I'd like to think so.  I miss her so much.  I mean, I know
I'll be going back in a week or two but I hate being away from her
for too long.  I feel empty, incomplete somehow.  I bet you'll think
I'm being sentimental or sappy but I really think she's my soulmate.
She is my everything," Sam confessed.</p>

<p>"Aww, Sam, that's sweet," Carmen said. "A little sappy sure,
but sweet." </p>

<p>"Gee thanks, Carm," Sam snorted good naturedly.  </p>

<p>"Ladies and gentleman," the host said from the small stage a
few feet away from where the group sat. "It's Karaoke time." Sam
groaned and put her head down on the table.</p>

<p>"Shoot me," she mumbled.</p>

<p>"First up, we have a special dedication," he said as the
music started to fill the room.</p>

<p>"Thank God my back is to the stage," Sam pointed out to
Harrison who nodded and smiled at her blankly.
</p>

<p>&lt;Oh my life <br>
	Is changing everyday<br>
	In every possible way <br>
	And oh my dreams<br>
	It's never quite as it seems<br>
	Never quite as it seems&gt; </p>

<p>"God, I miss her so much I can almost hear her voice," Sam
sighed to no one in particular.</p>

<p>&lt;I know I've felt like this before<br>
	But now I'm feeling it even more<br>
	Because it came from you <br>
	And then I open up and see<br>
	The person falling here is me<br>
	A different way to be&gt;</p>

<p>Sam felt a hand on her shoulder and warm breath in her ear.
It was then that she realized that the voice she heard singing was
indeed Brooke's.  She turned in her chair to face the blonde and
almost fainted.</p>

<p>"Are you really here?" she whispered.  Brooke smiled and
nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes," Brooke answered.</p>

<p>&lt;La<br>
	I want more (impossible to ignore)<br>
	impossible to ignore<br>
	And they'll come true (impossible not to do)<br>
	impossible not to do&gt;</p>

<p>"Oh my God!" Sam engulfed her in a giant hug.  "What are you
doing here?" she asked as tears started to stream down her face.</p>

<p>"Standing although I was singing a minute ago," Brooke
answered cheekily as the music continued without her.</p>

<p>&lt;And now I tell you openly<br>
	You have my heart so don't hurt me<br>
	You're what I couldn't find <br>
	A totally amazing mind<br>
	So understanding and so kind<br>
	You're everything to me&gt;</p>

<p>"I finished my exams early and got coverage for my shifts so
I thought I'd surprise you.  Surprise," she finished as Sam just
beamed from ear to ear.</p>

<p>"Yeah Sam, surprise," Lily said from the table.</p>

<p>"You guys knew?" Sam asked as she wrapped her arms around
Brooke again, intent on never letting go.</p>

<p>"Yeah, it was her idea to meet us here," Carmen explained.</p>

<p>"Sam, I heard you talking and this girl of yours must be
really special," she said as she brought her lips to Sam's for a long
overdue kiss.</p>

<p>"Oh she is," Sam whispered as she met Brooke halfway. "She
very much is.  And I love her with all my heart."</p>

<p>"Lucky for you, she loves you just as much," Brooke responded
as she finally pressed her lips to Sam's and they were both finally
home.</p>
