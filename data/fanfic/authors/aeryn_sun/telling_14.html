<!-- Telling Series \ Section 5: Nicole - Time Flys, Why Don't You Go Find It? -->

<p>"What's up, B?" Nicole asked at school the next day and
watched as Brooke jumped about three feet straight up in the air without bending
at the knees first. (Pretty impressive feat, reminds me of a cat) Nicole thought
dryly, while Brooke waited for her heart to restart itself. </p>
<p>"Jesus, Nic, do I need to put a bell around your neck or
what?" Brooke asked as her heart finally slowed its frantic pace. Nic arched an
eyebrow. </p>
<p>"As long as it's a Prada or Gucci bell and not a cowbell, I'll
think about it," Nic responded. "Too much caffine in your cappachino this
morning or what, B?" Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, just a little jumpy, that's all," Brooke shot back. </p>
<p>"Brooke, I've seen people with Post-Tramatic Stress Disorder
in a warzone less jumpy than you are right now. I know we aren't as close as we
once were, if we actually ever were close. And I know that trying to kill a
person tends to put a strain on your relationship but, you can talk to me, you
know?" Nic offered sincerely. And she was sincere. Of all the backs she would
still willingly and gladly stab to get ahead, Brooke and Sam's weren't anywhere
in her Mike Myers (think Halloween, not Austin Powers) stabbing range. (Enough
damage was done there, thank you. Now, if Mary Cherry doesn't learn to keep B.
Ho the Hell away from me) Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Thanks, I may need to take you up on that," Nicole's eyes lit
up at this. Not in the formally evil, oh-I'm-gonna-sink-you-with-this-information
way that they used to but with a you're-going-to-trust-me? sort of happy way. </p>
<p>"Sam and I want to talk to you, actually," Brooke continued.
Now, the formally evil side of Nicole would have cringed at this and then had a
bitchy comment at spending time with Spam McPherson. But now she was just happy
that they were both still willing to speak to her. (And not chase me around with
garden tools to carve out my insides) </p>
<p>"Well, I'm free after school today, if that's OK with you
two," Nicole offered. Brooke nodded absently. </p>
<p>"Yeah, come by the Palace. Mom and Dad are away so we can talk
without interruption. Around four?" Nicole nodded and smiled. </p>
<p>"Wouldn't miss it." </p>

<p>**</p>

<p>"Stop pacing, you're making me nervous," Sam asked her frantic
girlfriend who was currently wearing an interesting pattern in the carpeting. It
was quarter to four and as it got closer to the agreed on time, Brooke was
getting more and more worked up. Sam was starting to worry that the poor girl
was going to give herself a stroke. </p>
<p>"How can you not be nervous? This is Nicole Julian. Miss `I'm
pissed off, let's get drunk and run down my best friend' herself. And that time
she was upset over what I told George about her. Now I'm about to tell her that
I'm gay and I'm in love with you! You know she's not your biggest fan," Brooke
warned. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"I think I figured that out somewhere between freshman year
and the sound of tires screeching," Sam answered absently without thinking.
Brooke stopped her pacing. </p>
<p>"Saaaamm," she wailed, half-angry, half in pain. Sam shot up
out of the armchair and enveloped her in a strong hug. </p>
<p>"Sorry," she whispered in Brooke's ear. "Open mouth, disengage
brain. Typical Sam. I'm sorry." Brooke relaxed in her arms. </p>
<p>"S'OK," Brooke told her. She rested her head on Sam's shoulder
and thanked God for what felt like the millionth time that she still had Sam in
her life. She stayed like that, wrapped in Sam's warm, strong arms until the
doorbell rang and she reluctantly untangled herself from the only place she
truly felt safe anymore. She stared into Sam's mahogany brown eyes. </p>
<p>"Ready?" Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"When you are, love," Sam answered with a half smile. After
giving her a quick kiss, Brooke answered the door. Nicole walked in and spared
Sam a small smile, which Sam returned. It struck Sam odd that Nicole seemed
nervous. </p>
<p>"What's up, twinkies? Need fashion advice, Spam? Because I've
told you that that shirt and pants don't go," Sam looked at her outfit and
frowned. As she was about to get annoyed, she heard the small giggle bubble
forth from Nicole. </p>
<p>"I swear, Sam, you are such an easy mark," Nicole laughed.
Most of the tension eased in the room at the joke although Brooke still felt a
bit anxious. </p>
<p>"Ha ha, very funny, Nicole," Sam snickered sarcastically. "Did
you come all this way to poke fun at the fashionally challenged or are you here
for a reason?" </p>
<p>"Brooke invited me, sort of. Didn't you know?" Nicole asked
nervously, looking from Brooke to Sam like she'd been set up for something. Sam
smiled evilly. </p>
<p>"Now who's the easy mark, Nic? Relax," Sam continued when she
saw the hint of fear creep up into Nic's eyes and realized she'd inadvertantly
scared the shorter blonde. "We just wanted to talk." </p>
<p>"Oh, OK. Thought for a second there you were going to go all
`Bully' on me," Nic confessed as she plopped down on the couch. "Whatcha wanna
talk about?" </p>
<p>"Nicole, this is kind of hard for us, and we want you to hear
us out," Sam started when Brooke could only manage to open and close her mouth
like a guppy stranded on land. If it weren't such a serious conversation, Sam
would have laughed at the sight. </p>
<p>"Sam, I think after the Hell I put the two of you and your
family through, and the fact that of all people you extended an olive branch to
me, which you didn't turn around and try to stake me through the heart with, the
least I can do for you is listen to you. Whatever you two have to say I'll
listen. I'm no where near redemption yet, so, lay it on me," Nic said, meaning
every word. Brooke sat down on the couch and Sam sat on the arm of it beside her
with her hand on Brooke's shoulder. The little gesture didn't go unnoticed by
Nicole. She arched her eyebrow again but said nothing. </p>
<p>"Nic, things have changed around here. I mean really changed,"
Brooke started, hating herself for her vagueness. Nicole nodded. </p>
<p>"Yeah, so? Plaid is out, mini's are back, so what else?" </p>
<p>"I don't think you're following me. I mean with me and Sam.
Things have changed with me and Sam. Between us," Brooke continued before she
faltered and looked up at her girlfriend. </p>
<p>"Did you take a `vague pill' before she came over?" Sam asked
her. Brooke sighed and put her head in her hands and sighed again. Sam looked at
Nicole with a sad look on her face. </p>
<p>"What Miss Articulation 2001 is trying, and failing miserably
I might add, to say is since my recovery our relationship has changed. It's
deepened. We discovered that we had unrequited feelings for each other that
were, well, requited." Nicole looked at her blankly. Now Sam sighed. (Gee, that
helped) </p>
<p>"OK, maybe I'm overarticulating. Nic, Brooke and I are in love
with one another and are involved in a loving, romantic and fulfilling
relationship. There, I said it." Sam slid off the arm of the couch onto the
couch itself next to Brooke and the two of them watched for a reaction from the
short blonde known for her explosive outbursts. Nicole blinked a few times
before speaking. </p>
<p>"You're gay?" Nicole asked with a confused frown. Both girls
nodded. "As in a Melissa Etheridge/Tammy Lynn Michaels sort of gay?" <br>
<font color="#3399FF">{A/N:sorry, couldn't resist =)} </font> </p>
<p>"Yes," Sam responded firmly. Nicole nodded slowly, frown still
in place and still looking confused. </p>
<p>"Oh." </p>
