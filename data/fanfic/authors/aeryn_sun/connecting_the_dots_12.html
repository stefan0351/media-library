<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Twelve -->

<p>Sam tossed and turned on her bed unable to relax or get
comfortable. The hairs on the back of her neck were standing on end and her skin
had an itchy tingle to it. It was driving her buggy. School was set to start
again in a week and she was worried about how Brooke was going to handle it. Or
more accurately, how everyone else was going to handle Brooke. As the summer had
progressed and it had become apparent that her memory wasn't returning anytime
soon, visits by Mary Cherry and Nicole grew more infrequent. It didn't help that
this Brooke had the habit of telling people exactly what she thought of them. </p>
<p>To Mary Cherry, her sentiment had gone something like this: </p>
<p>"You're a back-water, inbred, redneck, honky tonk, copycat,
axe murderer wannabe who rides on the coat tails of others because you have no
mind or independent will of your own. In ten years, some of us will be on VH1's
'Where Are They Now?', you'll be on 'America's Most Wanted'." </p>
<p>To Nicole, it went like this: </p>
<p>"OK, Speed Racer, let's get a few things straight. I may not
remember you but you can drop the innocent act, I'm not buying it. Even I can
see you're a cold, manipulative, backstabbing bitch who has her eyes on the
prize and who doesn't care who she hurts to get what she wants. I've seen
reptiles that emote more than you do. The old me may have been able to overlook
the fact that you tried to run her over. I have no clue why. But I am not so
forgiving. You could have hurt Sam or me and that's unacceptable. I don't like
you, Nic, and until you learn about compassion and what friendship really is, I
doubt I ever will." </p>
<p>Saying such things, however truthful, tends to make one a
social outcast and Sam was worried for Brooke. While the blonde had no real
memory of being the high school popularity queen, being flung to the bottom rung
of the social ladder was no picnic either. </p>
<p>She opened her eyes when she heard a pair of bare feet
stumbling across the tiled bathroom and Brooke lurched into the doorway.
</p>
<p>"Brooke?" she whispered concerned. She looked at the clock
which read 2:37 AM and then back at Brooke. "What's wrong?" </p>
<p>"Sam...mmy..." Brooke croaked as she staggered blindly over to
Sam's bed and fell down onto it. Sam immediately sat up and gathered the crying
blonde into her arms. </p>
<p>"What is it, hon?" Sam asked worriedly. Brooke shuddered and
gasped in Sam's arms as she dug her fists into Sam's shirt. </p>
<p>"Head...hurts," she whimpered against Sam's chest as fresh
sobs overtook her. Sam's heart broke to hear the pain Brooke was in. She gently
stroked the hair away from Brooke's face and kissed her forehead in comfort as
she rocked the shaking girl. </p>
<p>"Did you take your meds?" she asked quietly. She felt Brooke
nod against her. "Do you want me to get Mom or Mike?" </p>
<p>"No," Brooke sobbed. "Just stay with me and hold me please.
You always make the pain go away," she explained in a small child's voice. Sam
felt her own tears sting her eyes at Brooke's words. She lay back down taking
Brooke with her and felt the other girl settle in next to her. </p>
<p>"I'd give anything to stop it from hurting completely," Sam
whispered. Brooke lifted her head from where it lay on Sam's warm shoulder and
looked into Sam's concerned eyes. </p>
<p>"I know you would," she sniffed. She looked into Sam's face
and watched as her eyes shut and a few tears fell past her lids. She reached up
and wiped them away, captivated as Sam's brown eyes opened and focused intently
on her. She traced her tear stained fingers over Sam's full lips, feeling their
soft velvety surface against the pads of her fingertips. Despite her pounding
headache, Brooke couldn't help but feel elated at such an intimate moment. </p>
<p>Sam's eyes grew wide as Brooke's hand moved over her lips. She
had to fight the urge to lick the salt from her lips as Brooke's fingers
lingered lightly. </p>
<p>"Brooke?" Sam whispered surprised and shocked at the blonde's
move. She was also secretly pleased that Brooke was touching her in such a
loving way. </p>
<p>"Shhh..." Brooke responded pressing her fingers lightly
against Sam's lips to silence her. Acting before she lost her nerve, Brooke
leaned up and pressed her lips against Sam's, tasting the tang of salt from
their combined tears. It was the sweetest thing she'd ever experienced,
expecially as she felt Sam relax and respond to her. </p>
<p>"Brooke...don't," Sam begged as she pulled away. </p>
<p>"Shhh, Sammy," Brooke told her as the relentless pounding in
her head roared back and the darkness swallowed her. </p>
<p>Sam felt Brooke's head fall limply against her chest and knew
that the headache had caused the girl to pass out. She was close to passing out
herself from the shock of the kiss. She couldn't believe Brooke had done that
and at the same time was ecstatic that she had. </p>
<p>(I'm so confused) Sam thought. (She's been acting so...strange
lately. Almost like she wants me or something. No, I'm reading too much into it.
She already told me that she depends on me. That's all it is) she told herself. </p>
<p>She resettled on the bed with Brooke wrapped securely in her
arms. The unconscious form still trembled slightly from the pain in her head.
Sam rocked her and rubbed her back while singing softly to her. She stayed awake
long after Brooke's shaking had stopped and the blonde had fallen into a
dreamless slumber. She herself couldn't relax enough to sleep, not with the
swirling feelings of confusion, warmth, and slight twinge of fear that were
filling her. </p>
<p>(What if this Brooke IS falling for me?) Sam wondered. (Her
behavior lately sure points to more than sisterly feelings) she realized. Sam
shook her head. </p>
<p>(I can't let that happen. It's not right) she decided. (If I
let my feelings rule me and pull Brooke into something she doesn't really want,
I'll lose everything. And then, if her memory DOES return she'll never forgive
me. I'd die if she ever hated me) she cried silently. </p>
<p>(For better or worse, Brooke, we'll never be more than
friends) </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Brooke woke up to an empty bed. She turned over into Sam's
spot and buried her nose in Sam's pillow, inhaling the other girl's unique
scent. Finally rolling completely over, she saw a glass of water, her medication
and a cinnamon muffin on a tray on the bedstand along with a note. </p>
<p><i>Brooke- </i> </p>
<p><i>I had to run some errands. Hope you're feeling better. Eat and
take your medication. I'll see you later. </i> </p>
<p><i>Sam </i> </p>
<p>She smiled at Sam's thoughfulness even though she was
disappointed that Sam had left without her. She really enjoyed waking up with
Sam beside her. She stretched and then crawled out of bed. Her headache had
dimmed to a dull roar. In spite of the doctors reassurances that physically she
was fine, the attacks frightened her. Part of her hoped that during one of the
attacks her memories would come flooding back. Not that she honestly cared one
way or another whether it ever returned, she was just more interested in what
she knew about Sam. Those were the memories she wanted back. She wanted to
remember every smile, every glance, even every glare and harsh word because it
was a piece of Sam. </p>
<p>She took her medication and ate the muffin as she headed to
her own room. Jane was leaving some clean clothes for her and greeted Brooke
with a bright smile. </p>
<p>"Good morning, honey. I didn't know you were home," Jane said
cheerfully. Brooke winced. Her head still hurt slightly and having to deal with
an overly cheerful Jane was only going to make it worse. </p>
<p>"I slept in Sammy's room," she informed Jane simply. Jane
frowned. </p>
<p>"Another migraine?" she asked noticing the pale color of
Brooke's skin and the dark circles under her eyes. </p>
<p>"Yeah," Brooke sighed. "A bad one." </p>
<p>"I'm worried about you, Brooke," Jane said concerned. "These
headaches should be getting better, not worse. Or your memory should've started
to return." Brooke huffed at her. </p>
<p>"Look, Mom," she started, the word still feeling strange
rolling off her tongue. "Can you please get off my back about my memory? It may
never come back, OK? Deal. As for my headaches, the doctors said that it was
likely stress from trying to remember and having to assimulate so much
information," she finished a bit angrily. Jane stared at her in shock. She was
still unused to such outbursts coming from Brooke. Brooke was always known for
her even temper and kindness. </p>
<p>(Guess her mood swings are something else I'll have to learn
to deal with) Jane sighed quietly. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Brooke. I can't help worrying," she said softly. </p>
<p>"I know and I didn't mean to snap but you know the headaches
leave me cranky. The last thing I need is an interrogation about getting my
memory back," Brooke explained. "It's not like I lost my freaking car keys for
God's sake." </p>
<p>Jane decided now would be a good time to leave Brooke's line
of fire before the formally agreeable blonde went totally ballistic. </p>
<p>"Well, here are some clean clothes. I'll talk to you later,"
Jane said exiting the room quickly. She had noticed that lately the only person
who didn't immediately inspire Brooke's wrath was Sam. She just hoped it stayed
that way and Brooke didn't end up pushing everyone away. </p>
<p>After Jane retreated, Brooke sat down on her bed and started
to giggle. </p>
<p>"Bitchy today, aren't we, Brooke?" she asked herself. "Christ,
I HAVE cracked. I'm talking to myself." </p>
<p>She curled up on her bed and rethought her actions from the
night before. She knew the reason Sam was gone when she woke up was the kiss
they'd shared. She'd pushed Sam's fragile feelings too far and Sam had run
again. It was Sam's pattern. It was annoying but somewhat expected. Brooke
really wasn't sure what motivated her to kiss Sam other than an overwhelming
need to. At that moment she'd needed to feel Sam's lips against her own, taste a
small bit of Sam if only for a second. It was the only thing that she knew would
make her feel better. But in her own selfish need to feel better, she hadn't
thought about how it would affect Sam. </p>
<p>(There goes that trust she had in me. I abused it last night)
she realized mournfully. (In my own pathetic moment of need, I crushed our
friendship. I see what she meant now about one of us breaking our truces. I
guess it was my turn) she sighed. While she didn't actually regret what she had
done, she was sorry for any damage it may have done to her relationship with
Sam. She needed that girl, she wasn't too proud to admit that. Sam's strength
was what was keeping Brooke from snapping completely or spiraling into a
full-blown depression. </p>
<p>(Please don't hate me for my moment of weakness, Sammy) Brooke
begged silently. (I need you) </p>
