<!-- Getting What You Deserve And Deserving What You Get -->


<p>"SPAM MCPHERSON, I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!  AND THIS TIME I'LL FINISH
THE JOB!" the bellow echoed down the halls of Kennedy High school two
months into the school year.  Sam turned in the direction of the
voice, leaning slightly on her cane as she did so, to see the
shorthaired blonde coming barrelling towards her like a cannonball
shot out of a cannon.  Any and all persons in the hall were wise to
get out of the enraged Nicole Julian's way and many sent up a prayer
for the soul of Sam McPherson. After all, the last time an angry
Nicole and Sam had met up, Sam had nearly died.  But Sam just watched
her approach, knowing why the shorter girl was upset, and enjoying
every second of it.</p>

<p>When Nic reached her, her blue eyes on fire with fury, she latched on
to Sam's arm none too lightly and dragged her to the Novack across
the hall.  Sam let herself be led away without protest, much to the
confusion of their observers.  But they chalked it up to her
remaining injuries.  The last thing she saw as the door swung shut
was the panic-stricken face of her love, Brooke McQueen, as she
rounded the corner of the hall towards the commotion.</p>

<p>Brooke threw open the door to find Sam sitting on the couch calmly
while Nicole kicked the doors of ths stalls open to ensure that they
were alone.  That done, she turned her attention back to the bane of
her existance.  Her eyes were still angry, but not rage filled.</p>

<p>"My family is going to be so pissed," Nicole said with a chuckle, the
anger draining out of her eyes completely.  Brooke let out the breath
she didn't know she was holding.  Sam laughed.  </p>

<p>"Yes, well, I'll never reveal my sources so they'll never know it was
you who gave me that info on how you walked away scott-free because
they paid off the judge and all." Brooke shook her head.</p>

<p>"God, you two, you scared the Hell out of me," she announced slightly
annoyed.  "I thought Nic was really going to kill you this time."
Both Nicole and Sam laughed.</p>

<p>"Nah, no luxury cars in the vicinity," Sam joked.  Nic
winced.  "Geez, Nic, sorry." Nicole sighed.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it, we all cope in our own ways.  But, Brooke, we
have to keep up appearances.  Can't let anyone think I actually have
a heart now can we?"</p>

<p>"I guess not, but you two qualify for Oscars.  I heard you all the
way down the next hall," Sam bowed.</p>

<p>"I'd like to thank the Academy," she started.  Nicole rolled her eyes
and gagged.</p>

<p>"As if, Spam.  On a serious note, those pants don't match that shirt
and you just blew my family out of the water." Sam looked at her
outfit and shrugged.  There was the Nicole she knew.</p>

<p>"Couldn't have done it without you," Sam responded honestly.  Nicole
nodded.</p>

<p>"Yeah, well, someone has to pay for what I did.  Why not make it me
and my entire family?  I like it, Sam, I never knew you had such an
inner bitch," she said approvingly.  Sam smiled.</p>

<p>"I try," Sam answered.</p>

<p>"Well, I think I've spent enough time `chewing you out' for the
article.  Can't spend too much time with you or people will get
suspicious.  Later," Nicole said as she left the Novack and off to
torture some some unsuspecting soul.  &lt;Oh, look, there's April Tuna.
Perfect target&gt; Nicole homed in like a great white on a seal drenched
beach.  Sam and Brooke watched her go.  Brooke walked over and locked
the Novack door behind her, which won her an arched eyebrow from Sam.</p>

<p>"Alone at last," Brooke purred.  Sam giggled.</p>

<p>"Why, Ms. McQueen, have you been entertaining impure thoughts about
me again?" Brooke sighed.</p>

<p>"Only since you left my room this morning.  No wait, since you left
my shower this morning," she corrected herself as she kissed Sam
deeply.  She felt Sam smile through the kiss.</p>

<p>"Naughty, naughty.  You know, they have names for people like you?"</p>

<p>"Ravenous?"</p>

<p>"Nymphomaniacal was actually where I was going with that thought,"
Sam teased.  Brooke huffed indignantly.</p>

<p>"It takes two, Sammy," she breathed.  She felt the answering
vibration of laughter in Sam's frame.</p>

<p>"Don't I know it," Sam admitted.  Brooke brushed some hair away from
Sam's face.</p>

<p>"Did I tell you today how much I love you?" Sam shook her head.  </p>

<p>"Not since, let's see," she paused for dramatic effect. "There was
your bedroom and then the shower and when I got out of the car this
morning.  That's about it," she informed Brooke very seriously.
Brooke gave her a dazzling smile.</p>

<p>"I love you Sammy." Sam returned the smile.</p>

<p>"I love you too, Brooke." There was a knock on the door and they
realized that this was going to have to wait until they got home
later.  Brooke helped Sam up off the couch and handed her her cane
and then kissed her again before she unlocked the door.  Carmen
opened the door looking very confused.</p>

<p>"Why was the door locked?" she asked.  Brooke and Sam shrugged.</p>

<p>"Satan musta locked it on her way out.  She flew outta her so fast on
that broomstick of hers that frankly I'm surprised no one else is in
a coma," Sam commented coolly.  Carmen arched an eyebrow but went
with it.</p>

<p>"What are you two up to tonight?  Lily and Josh have off so we
thought we'd all get together and hang, you know?"</p>

<p>"Actually," Brooke broke in, "Sam and I have to watch Mac while Mom
and Mike are gone and we can't leave.  And we can't have anyone over
because Mac's a little under the weather." Sam looked at her.  It was
a half-lie.  They had to watch Mac but she was healthy as a horse.
Carmen looked disappointed but recovered.</p>

<p>"Oh, OK, another time then.  See you later," she called as she went
into the Novack and Sam and Brooke left.  Sam turned to Brooke with a
sly smile.</p>

<p>"Very nice lie, Princess," she complimented.  Brooke grinned.</p>

<p>"I have very distinct plans for us tonight and trust me, I do NOT
want company." She enjoyed the blush that suddenly covered Sam's
face.  The rest of the school day passed much too slowly for the both
of them.</p>
