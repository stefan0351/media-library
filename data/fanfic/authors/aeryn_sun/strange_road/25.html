<!-- Party Time -->


<p>"The gang'll be here soon," Jane said as she pushed Sam into the
kitchen.  Nicole nodded.  She could take a hint.</p>

<p>"Thank you all, for everything.  Really, you have no idea what it
means to me.  I'll head out now.  Thanks again," she said as she
headed towards the door.  Brooke watched for a minute before turning
to her parents.  Both Mike and Jane shrugged, the decision was up to
her.  She looked at Sam.  Sam smiled.  &lt;Whatever you decide,&gt; her
eyes told Brooke, &lt;I'll back you up.&gt;  Brooke smiled back and turned
to the retreating figure.</p>

<p>"Hey, Nic," Nicole turned around.  "You're welcome."  Thinking Brooke
meant it in the `Thank you'-`You're welcome' sort of way she just
nodded and turned back to the door.  Brooke sighed at her own
vagueness and tried again.</p>

<p>"No, Nic, I mean you're welcome to stay for the party." This made
Nicole spin around so fast all those watching thought she resembled
one of those tops that you pull the string to spin. Her eyes were
wide in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Wha…?" she muttered unable to speak.  Sam burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"Mark it on you calenders, boys and girls!  Nicole Julian is
speechless!" Brooke swatted her on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Hush, Sam.  I said you can stay for the party if you want to
Nicole."  Nicole shook her head.</p>

<p>"I…I can't Brooke.  I mean, thanks.  It means a lot, really.  But I
haven't got a gift.  I mean I do, just not with me, I was gonna mail
it.  And the whole gang is gonna be here and they might not like it
and…" Brooke waved her off.</p>

<p>"Tough.  It's my party and if I want you here…" Sam snickered and
started humming `It's My Party' which won her another swat.  "I swear
Sam you are getting incorrigible."</p>

<p>"Sorry," Sam apologized, not at all regretful.  Brooke rolled her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Anyway, I don't think things will ever be as they were.  This
doesn't mean I completely forgive you or that our slate has been
wiped clean.  You did try to run me down with your 37 thousand dollar
vehicle."</p>

<p>"At least she has expensive taste," Sam broke in, trying to keep the
mood light.</p>

<p>"Sam," Brooke warned.</p>

<p>"Sorry," she mumbled this time managing to sound apologetic.</p>

<p>"You hit Sam and nearly killed her.  That is nearly unforgivable but
if Sam can find it in her heart to try, I can to.  She's making an
effort to include you in her life and recovery so that you can
recover in your own way.  I can't turn you away when I can see the
genuine effort you're making to change.  I think I'm beginning to see
this person in you that Sam does.  The human person who made a
mistake and not the monster who was trying to hurt someone.  So stay
and let Sam and I deal with it if someone has a problem with it.
It's the only way that the others are going to see it too." Nicole
was crying again.</p>

<p>"Christ, I haven't cried this much since I was little and the two of
you have me weeping like frigging Susan Lucci on Emmy night," she
joked.  She sniffed.  "I'll stay if it's OK with your parents and if
I can go home to change out of these tear soaked clothes and get your
gift."  Mike and Jane smiled.</p>

<p>"It's fine with us.  It's really Brooke's decision and if she wants
you here then, you stay," Jane said.  Mike nodded.</p>

<p>"Then it's agreed.  We'll all deal with any awkwardness if it arises
and make this a super birthday.  But first, let me run you home real
quick, OK?"</p>
