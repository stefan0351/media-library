<!-- Nightmares And Fetishes -->


<p>"Sam!  No, please, no!" Her own scream as well as a gentle hand
stroking the sweat soaked hair away from her face awakened Brooke a
little over a week later. </p>

<p>"Nightmare?" Sam asked quietly from where she lay sprawled on the
floor beside Brooke.  Brooke stared at her for a few seconds trying
to figure out exactly how Sam had managed to get herself from her bed
to the floor.  True, Sam had some strength in her legs but she had no
where near enough to get herself up and out of bed and onto the
floor.  At least not without a heaping helping of embarrassment and
resembling a drunken sailor.</p>

<p>The comforter and sheets were still somewhat tangled around Sam's
ankles on the floor.  She was in such a hurry to get to Brooke after
the girl cried out that she hadn't paid much attention to freeing
herself from the blankets.  The desperation in Brooke's voice had
made it a secondary concern, Brooke being her primary.  Brooke
scrubbed her face with her hand.</p>

<p>"Yeah," she admitted reluctantly.  She was nervous now that Sam had
caught her sleeping on the floor of her temporary room.  She never
meant for Sam to catch her.  Sam regarded her carefully for a minute.</p>

<p>"Been having a lot of them lately," she said more as a statement of
fact than as a question.  Brooke frowned in confusion causing a soft
smile to spread across Sam's face.</p>

<p>"I know you've been sleeping in here every night since I came home,"
Sam told her.  "You come in after you think I've fallen asleep and
leave before you think I'm awake.  Pretty sneaky."  Brooke hung her
head in shame.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she said guiltily.</p>

<p>"What for?  Caring?  Don't be.  It'd work too if I was sleeping any.
I wouldn't have noticed.  But since my nocturnal activities involve
more counting of ceiling tiles and reviewing of my multiplication
tables than actual sleeping, I know that you're there.  I hear you
tossing and turning.  Sometimes you whimper," Sam continued very
softly, her voice almost cracking.  "And it kills me to hear you in
pain.  But for whatever reason, you felt that you needed to be here
and I didn't want to bother you.  Tonight was the first time you
screamed though."</p>

<p>"Again, I'm sorry," Brooke said as she started to stand up.  Sam
looked at her with unreadable eyes.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?  I didn't mean that you had to leave," she
trailed off sadly.  Truthfully, she felt better knowing Brooke was
there somewhere nearby.  It was kind of like knowing Brooke was
standing guard during her coma; she felt safe, secure, and loved.
Maybe it wasn't Brooke's intention but it was the end result.  She
didn't want Brooke to feel that she wasn't welcome anymore.</p>

<p>"I'll stay if you want me to, but we have to get you back into that
bed," Brooke informed her.</p>

<p>"Can't we just stay here on the floor for a little while longer?"</p>

<p>"I guess so," Brooke said as untangled the sheets from Sam's legs and
wrapped them around the two of them as they sat on the floor.  "So
why aren't you sleeping, Sam?"  Sam shrugged.</p>

<p>"Same reasons as you, I guess.  Nightmares.  And my back kinda hurts
although I'm sure the floor hasn't been doing wonders for yours."</p>

<p>"Why don't you tell the doctor that your back hurts or that you can't
sleep?  I'm sure he'd give you something," Sam shook her head.</p>

<p>"I hate taking meds, Brooke.  They make my brain all fuzzy.  I'd
rather be in a little pain and have a clear mind than feel nothing
and have the brain capacity of a carp." Brooke sighed.</p>

<p>"Suit yourself.  I don't know why I bother.  You're pig-headed,
stubborn, obstinate, not to mention inflexible."</p>

<p>"Yes, and you're cranky, cantankerous and ill-tempered when you don't
get any sleep."</p>

<p>"Are not."</p>

<p>"Are too."</p>

<p>"Are not."</p>

<p>"Are too."</p>

<p>"Well, we're maturing nicely, don't you think?" They both laughed.</p>

<p>"I think that counts as a relapse, don't you?" Sam asked.  Brooke
nodded.</p>

<p>"Yeah, definitely.  But you're still a stubborn ass." </p>

<p>"And proud, thank-you.  I try so hard to maintain a high level of
stubborn ass-ness.  Enough with this though.  Spill, McQueen.  Your
nightmare, what's it about?"</p>

<p>"Sam, I don't really want to talk about it."</p>

<p>"Come on, you might feel better if you tell me," Sam coaxed.  She had
a pretty good idea what the nightmare had been about but decided to
try and tease Brooke to lighten her mood.  "Dreaming about Mary
Cherry and B. Ho conspiring to usurp your throne as Queen of Kennedy
High?  I hear that between the two of them they have half a brain.
Or was it a naughty sex dream about Harrison?" At seeing how wide
Brooke's eyes suddenly got, Sam pushed it even further.</p>

<p>"It was!  It was a naughty sex dream!  Was it Harrison?  Josh?  No
wait!  Sugar?"  Sam burst into hysterics as Brooke continued to gape
at her in a rather shocked fashion.</p>

<p>"Better yet, was it `Lil' Lily?  Carmen?  Oh, wait, wait, wait, MARY
CHERRY?" By now Sam was howling with laughter and Brooke still
couldn't remember that English was her native language.</p>

<p>&lt;No, my late night fantasies and waking dreams involve a certain
ravishing, brown eyed, brown haired vixen with whom I share a
bathroom&gt; Brooke said to herself with a rather impish smile.</p>

<p>"Sam, that last one is enough to `give' me nightmares for a month,
thank you very much," she complained when she remembered how to
speak.  "And no, it wasn't a sex dream."</p>

<p>"Kinda figured since you yelled out my name," Sam pointed out
sounding kind of rejected.  Brooke shrugged more to hide her
embarrassment than anything else at the secret knowledge that she had
indeed called out Sam's name during some of her more enjoyable and
vivid dreams.  She was so centered on hiding her own embarrassment
that she missed the undercurrent of disappointment in Sam's voice.</p>

<p>"I was dreaming about the accident." Brooke admitted.</p>

<p>"Kinda figured that too."</p>

<p>"I mean, can we still call it an `accident'?  She was deliberately
trying to hit me."</p>

<p>"She was aiming for you but hit me instead, so I think it still
qualifies as an `accident'.  In the strictest sense, of course.  Tell
me vat you zee ezacktly," Sam said in a hideously bad German accent.
Brooke laughed.</p>

<p>"OK, Dr. Freud, you asked for it.  I see the car coming at me and I
can see Nic's face.  I'm not sure if I even saw her face that night.
But I see it now and she's got this insane, maniacal smile on her
face that just sends chills down my spine," she shuttered at the
memory and Sam moved closer to hug her in support.  At least that's
why she told herself she was doing it.</p>

<p>"The car gets almost to me and I close my eyes because I know it's
going to hurt and I'm probably about to die but all of a sudden,
there you are, knocking me out of the way."</p>

<p>"That's me, Super Sam.  Sounds pretty accurate so far."</p>

<p>"Yeah, it is.  And then I see, I see your eyes, Sam, like I saw them
that night." Sam frowned.</p>

<p>"My eyes?  What about them?"</p>

<p>"After you pushed me out of the way, there was this instant when I
saw your eyes just before Nic hit you.  You looked at me and I don't
know Sam, I've never seen that look from you before."</p>

<p>"Sheer abject terror?" Sam said helpfully.  Brooke shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, it looked like you were apologizing.  Why, Sam?  Why would you
feel the need to apologize for what you were doing?  What do you
remember?"  Sam shrugged.</p>

<p>"Not much.  Everything you've said up until the car hit me.  Then I
remember bits and pieces mostly.  Mostly you telling me to hold on
and that I'd be all right.  I do know that I didn't think I'd survive
being hit.  Maybe that's why I looked at you the way I did."</p>

<p>"Maybe," Brooke agreed although she wasn't completely convinced.
There was something about that look that was going to haunt her for a
very long time.</p>

<p>"Anything else?  Is there more to the dream?"</p>

<p>"Yeah.  I mean, everything else is the same in the dream as it
actually was.  Except in the dream when the doctor comes out to tell
us your condition, he tells us you're dead instead," Brooke started
to cry so Sam tightened her grip.</p>

<p>"And that's when you cried out?" Brooke shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, after everyone leaves the waiting room, it's just me and then
the door opens and you walk in.  Totally unharmed and I think that
it's all a huge mix up and you're OK.  You start to speak and you
yell at me and tell me how it's my fault that you're dead and if I'd
been a good person it never would have happened…" Brooke's tears got
the better of her and she couldn't continue.  Not that Sam needed or
wanted to hear anymore.  She was crying too; for the pain and guilt
that Brooke was carrying around with her despite the reassurances
that it wasn't her fault.</p>

<p>"Hey, easy there," Sam said soothingly.  "I'm still here, still alive
and I don't blame you.  I've told you that.  What happened is no
one's fault except Nicole's and Jose Cuervo.  OK?  Try and get that
through to the brain I know is hiding under all that Clairol blonde
hair you've got on top of your head."</p>

<p>"Hey," Brooke scowled good-naturedly, "I do not dye my hair."</p>

<p>"Sure, whatever, I believe you," Sam said looking at how the
moonlight streaming in lit up Brooke's face and glistened off the
tear tracks.  Not thinking, she reached up and gently brushed away
the tears.  She saw Brooke close her eyes and suddenly realized what
she was doing.</p>

<p>"I…I'm sorry," she said hastily as she snatched her hand away like
she'd been burned.  "I shouldn't have…"</p>

<p>"It's OK, Sam," Brooke reassured her with a small, gentle smile.  Sam
felt the coil of worry that had settled in her stomach a moment ago,
relax a little.  &lt;Boundries, Sam, boundries.  Gotta watch those
boundries&gt;</p>

<p>"Anyway," Brooke broke into Sam's thoughts.  "We should really try to
get some sleep."</p>

<p>"I guess."  Brooke unravelled the blankets from around them and
remade the bed.  </p>

<p>"How did you manage this by the way?  Just for curiosity's sake."</p>

<p>"I couldn't just lay there and listen to you yell like that.  You
sounded like you were being tortured, although from what you've told
me, that seems like a fairly accurate description.  I've got a lot of
upper body strength now, thanks to therapy and the `chair so I just
pulled myself down and over."</p>

<p>"I'm surprised you didn't land flat on your face," Brooke said as she
laced her arms around Sam's waist from behind and lifted.  She was
quite a bit stronger now too, thanks to helping with Sam's physical
therapy.  </p>

<p>"Ha, funny thing that.  I did.  Thankfully you were still asleep.
Not a pretty picture, let me tell you," Sam confessed sheepishly.
Brooke laughed.</p>

<p>"As long as you're OK."</p>

<p>"I'm fine," Sam answered as they finally made it over to the bed
using what strength she did have in her legs.  Not that she was going
to let Brooke know but the journey from the floor to the bed sent
waves of agony shooting up her spine to the base of her skull.  She
just lay there panting and waited for the pain to pass.  &lt;Suddenly,
drugs are looking so much better&gt;</p>

<p>"Ug…Slim Fast, Sam.  It's called Slim Fast," Brooke kidded after they
collapsed on the bed.</p>

<p>"Ha ha, very funny.  I told you my ass was getting fat," Sam answered
as Brooke propped herself up on her elbow and looked down at Sam.</p>

<p>"And as I said before, there is nothing wrong with your ass."</p>

<p>"You know, in some circles, this would be considered flirting," Sam
pointed out playfully.</p>

<p>"In some circles," Brooke repeated.  "But I'm tired tonight.  And we
never travel in the same circles." She moved to get up off the bed.
Sam grabbed her hand.</p>

<p>"You're welcome to stay if you want to," she said quickly, willing
her blood not to rush to her cheeks.  Brooke jumped a little but
didn't pull away.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Look, you obviously sneak in here for a reason.  If it makes you
feel better to watch me sleep, or pretend to sleep, than stay."
Brooke nodded and started for the floor.  "The bed is much more
comfortable than the floor, trust me.  And I don't bite, unless
you're into that sort of thing, Brooke," she added with a very
devilish smirk.</p>

<p>"Flirting again.  Shame on you," Brooke scolded, sliding into the bed
nonetheless.</p>

<p>"So why do you feel the need to come into my room every night, not
that I mind the company, because I don't.  I'd just like to know if
it's me or if you've got a fetish for watching young brunettes that
we need to know about.  For safety's sake, of course."</p>

<p>"No, no fetishes," &lt;none I'm willing to tell you about right now&gt; "I
guess…I guess I just got used to sleeping in the same room as you at
the hospital.  Hearing you breathe, your heartbeat.  I guess I missed
it."</p>

<p>"Oh," was all Sam could think of to say.  Of all the answers she'd
been expecting, she hadn't been expecting one so, sweet.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I missed it while you were staying at rehab.  I didn't sleep
very well.  I never planned for you to find out and hoped I'd get
over it before you did.  I didn't want to freak you out."</p>

<p>"No freaking out here.  I told you I didn't mind and I meant it," Sam
reminded her as she absently played with a lock of blonde
hair.  "It's actually very sweet."  Brooke shifted slightly so that
she was facing Sam.</p>

<p>"What are we doing?" Sam shrugged and looked around the room,
anywhere but at Brooke herself.</p>

<p>"Trying to fall asleep?" she asked even though she knew that wasn't
what Brooke meant by the question.</p>

<p>"That's not what I mean," Brooke said with a hint of annoyance in her
voice.  Sam turned and looked at her finally.</p>

<p>"I know," she sighed.  "And I don't know.  But I'm tired right now.
Why don't we try to get some sleep?"</p>

<p>"OK," Brooke agreed not really wanting to figure out what was going
on between them right now either.  "Night Sam."</p>

<p>"Good night, Brooke," Sam echoed a moment later.  They both fell
asleep a few minutes later and for the first time in a long time, bad
dreams plagued neither girl.</p>
