<!-- Prognosis Isn't Good, Does Our Insurance Cover This? -->

<p>"Family of Samantha McPherson?" the doctor asked a few hours later.
Everyone stood up as one as Mike and Jane stepped forward with Brooke.</p>

<p>"That's us," Mike said, indicating, not only himself, Brooke and
Jane, but also the group of teens in the room with them.  "All of us,
Doctor.  These are her friends and we don't want to keep anything
from them." The doctor looked at Mike dubiously for a moment before
nodding.</p>

<p>"If you're sure?" he asked. Mike nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, absolutely."</p>

<p>"Alright then.  I'm Dr. Parker and I treated your daughter when she
was brought in."</p>

<p>"How is she doctor?" Jane asked nervously.  Dr. Parker ran his hand
through his short brown hair and sighed.</p>

<p>"When she arrived here she was unconscious and suffering from extreme
blood loss due to internal injuries," he started.  Jane sat down
heavily in a nearby chair with both Mike and Brooke on each side for
support.  Dr. Parker sat down across from them.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, I should have warned you first to sit down.  Hearing news
like this is never easy." Dread and fear filled Brooke's chest and
choked off her air as she tried to ask the next question.</p>

<p>"Is she...is she dead?" she asked her voice barely above a whisper as
she stared at the floor, unable to meet the doctor's gaze.  Dr.
Parker reached out and placed his hand on her knee to get her
attention.</p>

<p>"No," Brooke's head shot back up and she stared at the
doctor.  "She's alive and will be moved to the ICU shortly.  However,
she's not out of the woods yet." Brooke was too relieved that Sam was
still alive to ask any more questions.</p>

<p>"What are her injuries?" Mike asked, taking control of the
situation.  This girl was another daughter to him and his guilt at
letting Nicole out of his sight was eating him alive.</p>

<p>"I'll start with the most minor and therefore the easiest to treat.
She sustained several lacerations that needed numerous stitches to be
closed properly.  Some may scar but can probably be fixed in time
with cosmetic surgery.  A cosmetic surgeon was called in to stitch
any area that would show like the wound on her forehead.  That should
heal with minimal scarring."</p>

<p>"Her right arm and ankle are broken but the breaks were clean and
should heal with no problems.  Her left knee was dislocated in the
accident and has been stabilized."</p>

<p>"And these are the minor injuries?  Jesus," Carmen whispered as Lily
gave her a hug.  The doctor nodded sympathetically.</p>

<p>"The rest of the news I have for you isn't as good," he looked at the
group before him to make sure they were ready.  He saw only the
concerned faces of people who obviously cared for this girl very much
and Dr. Parker was relieved because he knew that Sam McPherson was
going to need all the help she could get.  </p>

<p>"I'm not going to lie to you, your daughter's injuries were very
severe.  The car hit her in the side at such a speed that essentially
it collapsed her ribcage on that side. The resulting fall from the
crash caused various fragments of those bones to penetrate numerous
tissues and organs, one of the worst of which was her liver.  She
suffered a substantial insult to her liver and blood loss due to
internal hemorrhaging as a result.  That alone would be enough to put
her in the critical state she's in but she has other injuries to
consider as well."</p>

<p>"Like what?" Josh voiced what everyone else was afraid to.  A thick
silence had fallen over all of them when the doctor had started to
outline Sam's injuries.  With every word he spoke, the reality of the
situation became more and more solid to the assembled group.  They
weren't going to wake up to find this a horrible nightmare and Sam
was obviously not leaving the hospital anytime soon.</p>

<p> Dr. Parker sighed; he really hated this part of his job.  Telling
anyone that their loved one was dead or dying was always hard but it
was harder when the patient was as young as Sam or when the
circumstances were as pointless as these were.</p>

<p>"As I said, her ribs were fractured and several pieces pierced her
right lung causing it to collapse. We were able to repair that damage
rather quickly. But that isn't what concerns me."</p>

<p>"Jesus, what else could there be?" Mike asked, rubbing Jane's back as
she continued to cry softly.  Brooke sat silently shaking and trying
not to vomit as she realized Sam could still die.  And that she
herself almost did.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry, your daughter suffered a skull fracture from when
her head impacted with the car's windshield and is in a coma. I
believe it's a combination of pressure on the brain caused the
fracture and blood loss that resulted in lack of oxygen to the
brain.  We operated to relieve the pressure and all we can do now is
wait and see how she does."</p>

<p>"Oh my God," Jane whispered not able to say anymore.  Her baby, her
first born and the only piece of her first husband she had left was
lying in the hospital near death and she wasn't sure if she could
handle it.  If it wasn't for Mike's strong hand on her back and
Brooke's hand in her own, Jane knew she would have fainted.  As it
was, Josh and Carmen were picking a lightheaded Lily up off of the
floor.  With a resigned sigh the doctor cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"Mr. and Mrs. McPherson?" Mike looked back at the doctor but didn't
bother to correct him.</p>

<p>"Please tell me there isn't more," Mike practically begged.  The
doctor shook his head.</p>

<p>"I am truly sorry.  Honestly, if that car had hit her straight on
instead of in the side we wouldn't be having this conversation.  I'd
be directing you to our Chaplin right now.  She wouldn't have
survived if it had hit her at that speed at any other angle.  It's a
miracle she's made it this far."</p>

<p>"But," Mike prompted, just wanting to hear it and move on to helping
Sam recover.  And Mike vowed, for Jane and Brooke's sakes as well as
his own, that she would recover.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, even if she does wake up from the coma, and I can't
give you any guarantees as to when, or even if, there's been some
significant swelling around her spinal cord."</p>

<p>"What does that mean, Dr.?" Jane asked, already knowing and dreading
the answer as time seemed to slow and the world stopped spinning.</p>

<p>"There may be some damage to her spinal chord.  Until the swelling
goes down and we can get a better look, we won't know for sure.  But
if there is damage, it could mean that even if she does survive,
there's a good chance Samantha will never walk again."</p>
