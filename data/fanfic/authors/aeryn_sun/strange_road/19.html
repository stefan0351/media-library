<!-- Beware Rodeo Drive -->


<p>"Seriously, Brooke, I don't think he meant any harm," Sam tried,
unsuccessfully to calm her incredibly irate shopping partner.
Brooke's face was bright red with rage and she was breathing heavily
through her nose.  Sam thought she resembled a bull about to charge a
Matador.</p>

<p>"That's not the point, Sam," she bit back through barely surpressed
rage.  Her shoulders shook and she had a white-knuckle grip on the
handles of Sam's wheelchair.</p>

<p>"I know, but he was just trying to be, what's the word, chivalrous?"
Sam offered.  Brooke wasn't calmed.</p>

<p>"He was being ignorant.  Just because you're in a wheelchair doesn't
mean you're an invalid, retarded, or incapable of understanding what
people are saying or doing around you!" Brooke ranted.  Sam
surpressed a giggle.  Brooke was so cute when she was being indignant.</p>

<p>"He had no way of knowing I wasn't any of the above, Brooke.  Come
on, there was a time you would have killed to have a guy that drop
dead gorgeous hit on you!  Just because he thought I was your
mentally handicapped sister doesn't mean he's an insensitive prick,"
she was openly laughing now.  </p>

<p>The incident started simply enough.  They had just come from one of
the many stores on the strip, loaded with bags when this blonde
haired, blue eyed, poster boy for Body Works bumped into Sam's
chair.  He was, to put it mildly, the bronze Adonis Sam had been
thinking about losing Brooke to earlier.  Well tone, tanned and
sculpted to perfection.  He, Milo, had apologized profusely to Brooke
while totally ignoring Sam.  While Brooke fussed over Sam and whether
she was all right, Milo had tried everything he could to get Brooke's
name, number, anything but she had steadfastly ignored him. </p>

<p> Until she insisted he apologize to Sam for bumping into her.  Milo
was confused having assumed that Sam was mentally deficient and
didn't know anything had happened.  But he apologized, however half-
heartedly and then offered to push Sam's chair to give
Brooke's `little bitty arms a rest'.  Sam never heard such language
come from Brooke and wished she had a tape recorder to have the
spectacle on record for a souvenir.  Needless to say, Milo went
running under threat of bodily harm.</p>

<p>Brooke let out a frustrated sigh. &lt;Maybe at one time I would have
jumped at the chance, Sam.  But not now.  He wasn't you and all I'm
interested in now is you&gt; She turned her now calmer eyes to the mirth
filled ones of her shopping companion and scowled.</p>

<p>"You find this funny?" Sam shook her head.</p>

<p>"Kinda, but only in the sense that I never figured you for jumping to
my defense like that," her smirk deepened, as did her eye color in
the bright California sushine.  "It was kinda sexy." Brooke's eyes
widened and she wanted to act appalled but she couldn't stop the
answering smirk from spreading across her own face.</p>

<p>"Yeah, well don't get used to it, McPherson.  Jump to your own
defense next time," she instructed.  Sam looked momentarily
crestfallen.</p>

<p>"Just as soon as I'm capable of jumping anywhere, I will," she
responded coolly.  Brooke mentally kicked herself for her comment.
Although Sam's hot and cold running moods were starting to tire her
out.</p>

<p>"Sam, I didn't mean," Sam interrupted her.</p>

<p>"So, where to next, oh, mighty God of the Shop-o-holics?" Brooke
sighed.  &lt;There we go again.  Manic-depressive Sam.  Scary&gt;</p>

<p>"Let's just go along the boardwalk until something catches our eye,"
she suggested.  Sam nodded.  Still feeling guilty over the `jumping'
comment, she impulsively leaned down and placed a light kiss to Sam's
right temple.  "I really am sorry for that comment, you know."</p>

<p>Recovering from the momentary shock of the featherlight kiss and the
tingles it sent throughout her body, Sam nodded and sighed.</p>

<p>"I know.  You know, since you not so politely informed him that I was
not your sister, Milo probably figures that we're together.  You
know, as in TOGETHER, TOGETHER," she pointed out playfully, needing
to draw attention away from how close they were getting.  Brooke
laughed.</p>

<p>"Probably," she agreed.</p>

<p>&lt;I wish&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;I wish&gt;</p>
