<!-- Rehab Hell Or Blow In My Ear And I'll Follow You Anywhere -->


<p>Three weeks later…</p>

<p>Brooke watched as Sam pushed herself through her daily paces at the
rehab center she'd moved to two weeks earlier.  Situps, pushups, and
painful leg exercises designed to rebuild strength and endurance in
her legs and taylored around the various casts still adorning the
girl.  She did all of this without a complaint or anything.  They
both thought Eric, her physical therapist was cute but Brooke's eyes
were focused solely on the sweating girl on the workout mat. And
other things they could be doing to wind up that sweaty and out of
breath. &lt;Bad thoughts, Brooke.  Illegal in 48 states.  So?  Move to
one of the other two. Shut up you stubborn inner voice!&gt;</p>

<p>Sam had make excellent progress the past few weeks according to
everyone and Brooke wasn't at all surprised given the girls' usual
tenacity once she set her mind to something.  There is precious
little that can stop Sam once she grabs on to what she wants, Brooke
knows this first hand having observed Sam for as long as she had at
school.  Usually it has to do with something she's investigating but
Brooke was relieved to see Sam applying that same focus to recovering.</p>

<p>"Hey, Brooke," Eric called over as her helped Sam to switch positions
on the mat.  Brooke walked over to the two and smiled.</p>

<p>"Hey, what's up?"</p>

<p>"I just got a page for another patient and I need to run out for a
sec.  I'll be right back, honest, but I don't want Sam to lose her
focus.  You've been here for every session so far, think you can run
her through her set of reps until I get back?" Brooke looked at Sam
who shrugged.</p>

<p>"I guess," she agreed.  Eric smiled.  </p>

<p>"Terrific, I'll be back as soon as I can.  And don't let Drama Queen
here freak you out, OK?  She know's what she's doing," he advised as
he headed towards the door.  Sam stuck out her tongue.</p>

<p>"Drama Queen my ass," she muttered.  Brooke looked up a little
anxious.</p>

<p>"Uhm, ready?" Sam nodded.</p>

<p>"Yeah, relax, Brooke, like he said, you've seen me do it like, a
hundred times, no prob," Sam reassured the nervous blonde, any hint
of her stutter gone thanks to time, diligence, and her speech
pathologist.</p>

<p>"Yeah, no prob," Brooke repeated as she helped Sam exercise her
legs.  She listened to the small pants; grunts and little pain filled
gasps that escaped from Sam's lips as she worked.</p>

<p>"You OK?" Brooke asked concerned after a particularly loud gasp.  Sam
closed her eyes and nodded.  </p>

<p>"Yeah, just my stitches pulling.  And my stitches pulling stitches
pulling scars.  I got muscles I didn't know I had hurting and all
this work and I still can't walk.  It doesn't seem fair," Sam
lamented.</p>

<p>"Aw Sam, the doctors say you'll walk again.  You gotta believe them.
You've got feeling in your legs, you can move them, it's all a matter
of time until they're strong enough again.  You just have to be
patient." Sam lay back on the mat.</p>

<p>"Patience is suddenly not one of my virtues," Sam declared.  Brooke
smiled while grabbing Sam's foot again.</p>

<p>"Hate to break it to you, Sammy, but it never was.  Now, back to
work, OK?  Press against my hand and lift."  Sam growled.</p>

<p>"Slave driver," she joked as she nonetheless complied.  Brooke smiled
as she continued to help Sam with her exercises.  Eric came back a
few minutes later and watched them.</p>

<p>"Nice job Brooke, you look like an old pro," he commented.  Sam
laughed.</p>

<p>"Yeah, she's got the whole bossing-people-around-thing down pat," she
joked.  Brooke smacked her in her good knee.</p>

<p>"Quiet you," Brooke warned.  Eric just smiled.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing actually.  I've been telling Sam that she'll be
free from rehab hell soon to go home on the weekends but she'll need
someone to help her out.  I get the feeling you're the person for the
job, Brooke."</p>

<p>"Me?" Brooke asked, surprised.  Eric nodded.</p>

<p>"Why not?  You know the exercises as well as Sam and I do, your
parents are setting up a workout area for Sam at home and you seem
more than capable of helping her.  Don't you want the job?  Your
parents thought you'd be perfect for it given how close the two of
you have gotten."</p>

<p>"Of course I want to help, if Sam wants me too, that is.  Do you
Sam?" Sam nodded her head vigourously.</p>

<p>"I couldn't think of anyone else I'd want there with me, Brooke," she
said honestly.  Brooke beamed, happy beyond belief at the simple
statement.</p>

<p>"Than it's settled.  We'll spend the rest of today and the next few
sessions going over the do's and don't of Sam's exercises, the most
glaring don't being: Don't let her try and convince you to let her
walk.  She'll end up doing more harm than good, won't you, Sam?" Sam
hung her head and grumbled a `yeah, whatever'.  Brooke looked at Eric
confused.</p>

<p>"When you went to get a bite to eat last week, she insisted I let her
try and take a few steps.  I knew, from previous experience, that
Miss Stubborn-Pants over here wouldn't take `no' for an answer.  I
tried to warn her that she wasn't ready and that she needed more time
for her spine and back to heal but she wouldn't listen."
Comprehension dawned on Brooke's face.</p>

<p>"That's why you looked like you'd been crying when I got back,"
Brooke exclaimed, understanding the tearstreaked face that had
greeted her after she'd returned from having a salad.  Sam had told
her it was a frustration attack but Brooke had figured it was
something else.</p>

<p>"Did you learn your lesson?" Brooke asked in a kindergarden teacher
voice.  Sam nodded.</p>

<p>"Yeah," she answered sheepishly.  "Small steps, pardon the pun."</p>

<p>"So, think you can handle this one?" Eric asked.  Brooke narrowed her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah, I think I can more than handle `this one'." Suddenly Sam
was very very nervous.</p>
