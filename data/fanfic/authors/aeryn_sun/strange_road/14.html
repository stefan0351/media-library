<!-- Never Surprise Someone Recovering From A Coma -->


<p>"Josh, Harrison and Sugar built the wheelchair ramp up the front
door, although from the way Carmen and Lily tell the story, Larry,
Moe and Curly would have been a more accurate description," Brooke
told Sam as she pushed the chair up the ramp to the door.  Sam
laughed.</p>

<p>"I'd have paid good money to see that, you know," she said after the
door opened and Brooke wheeled her in.</p>

<p>"I bet," Brooke said.  "Well, here we are at last, home again, home
again, jiggity jig."</p>

<p>"Getting all sentimental on me, are you, McQueen?" Sam teased.</p>

<p>"Don't you wish," Brooke scoffed.</p>

<p>"SURPRISE!" Josh, Lily, Harrison, Carmen, Mike, Jane, Sugar, and Mary
Cherry all yelled as they leapt out from various hiding places.  Had
she not all ready been sitting, Sam probably would have fallen over
from fright.</p>

<p>"Jesus!  Trying to scare me back into a coma or what, people?  God,"
she gasped trying to restart her heart.</p>

<p>"Drama Queen," Brooke teased as Sam stuck out her tongue.  Unable to
resist the chance to tease, Brooke leaned over in Sam's ear.  "Don't
stick your tongue out unless you intend to use it." Sam just stared
at her dumbfounded as everyone came over to welcome her home, unaware
of the little exchange.  The two of them had been playfully teasing
each other more and more as Brooke had gotten more involved with
Sam's rehab but never before had a comment been that open and
blatently suggestive.</p>

<p>"Huh?" Sam managed to utter as Carmen hugged her.  She looked at
Brooke who smiled innocently, shrugged and went to get herself a
drink of soda.  She didn't know what possessed her to say that, she
just did.  &lt;Besides, it was worth it to see the look on Sam's face&gt;
When she came back into the room, Sam was still looking at her like
she'd sprouted a third eye in the middle of her forehead and Brooke
almost laughed outloud.  &lt;If a little comment like that is going to
rattle her that badly, I wonder how far I can actually push it until
she gets mad?&gt;</p>

<p>The party went well and everyone had a good time but eventually they
all went home and Mike and Jane went up to bed leaving Brooke and Sam
alone to clean up the mess, (which somehow struck Sam as wrong, but,
oh well).</p>

<p>"Enjoy your little `Welcome Home' party, Sam?" Brooke asked as she
pushed Sam's chair into the kitchen.  Sam nodded.</p>

<p>"Yeah, you sure know how to keep a secret, Brooke," Sam said as she
dropped a few plates in the sink.</p>

<p>"You'd be surprised the secrets I can keep, Sammy," Brooke responded
cryptically with a smirk hidden behind Sam's head.  Sam jumped
slightly at the tone of Brooke's voice and the use, yet again, of the
name `Sammy'.  There was definitely something going on with the
cheerleader, Sam was sure of it now.  She just wasn't sure exactly
what.  &lt;OK, two can play this game&gt;</p>

<p>"Really?  Like what?" Sam asked in an innocent voice as she wheeled
herself around to face Brooke who looked around as she thought.</p>

<p>"Now, Sam, if I told you, it wouldn't be a secret anymore now would
it?" she teased as she walked a few feet away.</p>

<p>"I guess not.  Well, I suppose if you don't wanna share," Sam
pouted.  Brooke thought she looked awfully cute when she pouted, even
though it wasn't going to work this time.</p>

<p>"Don't stick your lip out at me like that, it's not going to help.
I'm immune to that particular charm now.  I'm still not going to
tell."</p>

<p>"Fine, be like that, brat," Sam raspberried her and wheeled away
towards the living room.  "Do you want another piece of cake?"</p>

<p>"Nah, I'm trying to watch my girlish figure," Brooke called from the
kitchen.  A devilish smile graced Sam's face as she joined Brooke in
the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Me too.  Watching your girlish figure, I mean," Sam almost burst out
laughing at the stupified look on Brooke's face.  Her jaw dropped
open and her eyes were as big as dinner plates from Sam's point of
view.  "Earth to Brooke?  You're gonna catch flies if you don't shut
your mouth soon.  Not the most attractive look for you, by the way.
Did I say something to disturb you?" Sam's voice was laced with
saccarine and false concern.  She batted her eyelashes at the
blonde.  Brooke blinked at her a few times.  She hadn't been
expecting Sam to fight back, but if she was going to, all the more
fun it would be.</p>

<p>"No, no, not at all.  Just momentarily surprised is all.  So, you
spend time watching my girlish figure?" she baited waiting for Sam to
grab on to the hook.  She wagged her hind end at the brunette for
good measure.  </p>

<p>"I've recently suffered a head injury and had brain surgery so I'm
not in my right mind at times.  Did I say I did?  Silly me.  I meant
that I need to watch mine.  Sitting in this chair is making my ass
fat," Sam answered, evading the line and trying not to stare at the
rear end being wagged at eye level.  Brooke could almost hear the
sound of a fishing pole snapping back.  She decided to try again.</p>

<p>"Your ass is just fine," as she said it she felt the blush crawl up
her neck to her ears and prayed Sam didn't see it.  But Sam did and
thought it was endearingly cute.</p>

<p>"Really?" Sam asked.  "I rather thought it resembled two pigs dancing
under a tarp." Brooke laughed outloud at the imagery evoked by Sam's
words.  She tried to stifle the laugh with her hand to no effect.</p>

<p>"I assure you," she said when she finished laughing, "there is
nothing wrong with your posterior.  As a matter of fact, it is
positively the most lovely posterior I have seen in quite a long
time.  Trust me on this because I get to see it up close and personal
everyday."</p>

<p>"OK, conversation taking an awkward turn," Sam said with a nervous
laugh as she now blushed as well.  "Although I appreciate the
compliment.  And stop looking at my ass."  They both started to laugh
at the last comment and then finished cleaning up the dishes in
silence.  As Sam started to wheel towards her temporary room, Brooke
walked up and hugged her from behind.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're all right, Sam.  And I'm glad you're finally home,"
she said seriously.  Sam hugged her back.</p>

<p>"Me too, Brooke.  I'm glad we're both all right.  That was way too
close," Sam said quietly, understanding Brooke's sudden change in
mood.  Brooke put her chin on Sam's shoulder and looked at the other
girls' profile.</p>

<p>"I know, Sammy, I know.  I see it everytime I close my eyes," Sam
leaned her head into Brooke's and sighed.</p>

<p>"So do I.  But we can't let her win, Brooke.  We just can't," Sam
whispered almost desperately.  As much as she knew Nicole would most
likely walk away, (wonderful choice of words, Sam, how witty) she
also knew if they continued to let the experience eat at them as she
was sure it was, ultimately, Nicole would win.  And she just couldn't
let that happen.</p>

<p>"I know.  It's just so hard," Brooke agreed.  She felt Sam nod
against her.  "Time for bed?"  She saw Sam smirk out of the corner of
her eye.</p>

<p>"Why, Ms. McQueen, is that an offer?" Brooke picked up her head in
surprise.  &lt;Sam 2, Brooke 0&gt;</p>

<p>"Why, Ms. McPherson, was that a `yes'?" Brooke countered after a
moments thought.</p>

<p>"Uhm…" Sam sputtered.  &lt;Sam 2, Brooke 1&gt;</p>

<p>"Eloquent as always," Brooke teased.  Sam stuck out her tongue as her
only defense.  "What did I tell you earlier?" Brooke warned.  &lt;Sam 2,
Brooke 2.  It's a tie game folks.  Next point could be the game
winner&gt;</p>

<p>"Maybe I plan to use it.  Ever think of that?" Sam teased back, semi-
serious as she gauged Brooke's reaction.  Brooke felt her stomach
drop and her head spin.  &lt;Sam 3, Brooke 2, game, set, match.  Today's
winner is Sam McPherson, but we have some lovely parting gifts for
the runner up&gt; There was no way she was pushing their little game any
further tonight.  Or any time soon.</p>

<p>"And on that incredibly incestuous note, I bid you good-night,"
Brooke said as she retreated from the game that she herself started.
Sam shrugged.</p>

<p>"Suit yourself.  I'll call Mom to help me get ready for bed," she
said dejectedly as she headed to her room.  Brooke nearly kicked
herself as she realized that Sam must have thought she'd gone too far
with the joke and that Brooke didn't want to help her anymore.</p>

<p>"Hey, I'll still help if you want me too.  If that's all right?  I
was just playing with ya," Brooke tried to explain quickly.  Sam
turned to her with a  hopeful smile.</p>

<p>"I was just playing too.  Besides, you're the one who always helps
me.  You don't make me feel like an invalid.  I know Mom means well
but I always feel like I should be drooling and incoherhent or
something."</p>

<p>"You mean that isn't normal for you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ha ha.  Your impressive cheerleader wit never ceases to amaze
me.  Ha ha," Sam scoffed.</p>

<p>"You asked for that one, Sam," Brooke told her as they headed for
Sam's room.  Sam nodded.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I suppose I did.  You didn't have to take advantage though,"
Sam argued.  Unable to resist the opening, Brooke smiled.</p>

<p>"I would never take advantage, unless you wanted me to," she
quipped.  Unseen by her, Sam smiled widely.</p>

<p>"Hook, line, and sinker," Sam whispered to herself.</p>
