<!-- Lunchtime Confessions -->


<p>"Why did you do it, Sam?" Brooke asked suddenly the next day.  Sam
looked up from her lunch in totally confusion.  She was beginning to
need a score card to keep up with Brooke.</p>

<p>"Huh?" Sam asked articulately.  Brooke sighed and stared at her
untouched food, turning a lettuce leaf over with her fork.  The
question had been haunting her and she needed an answer.  </p>

<p>"Why did you do it?  Why did you push me out of the way?" Brooke's
voice was very quiet and barely carried over to where Sam sat across
the table.  Sam put her sandwich down and repeated herself.</p>

<p>"Again, `huh'?  What kind of question is that and where is this
coming from?  Does left field know you stole its question?  And eat
something will you?  Don't think I didn't notice that you skipped
breakfast.  Mom and Mike left us in charge of one another, I watch
you, you watch me, now eat.  Or I'll force you to watch Pokemon 2000
again." Brooke picked at her salad for a few minutes more before
asking again.</p>

<p>"I don't get it, Sam.  I mean, I thank God everyday that you did it.
I know it's selfish, but I do.  I'm glad I'm alive and I know that
the only reason I am right now is because of you.  Because you were
willing to sacrifice so much for me.  I just don't understand why and
I need to."  Sam sighed and gave up trying to finish her lunch for
the time being.  Brooke was in one of her moods again and it was
pointless to try and do anything else until it passed.</p>

<p>"Why do you need to?  Don't you think you're worth the sacrifice?
Which, by the way, is way too strong a word," she countered.  She
couldn't believe that Brooke didn't think her life was worth saving,
which was the impression Sam was getting.  </p>

<p>&lt;I'd sacrifice myself a thousand times for you, Brooke.  I wish you
knew and understood that&gt;</p>

<p>"I need to know, Sam.  You saw that car heading towards me and you
acted without thinking about your own safety.  It was a sacrifice.
You could have and nearly were killed.  I don't understand.  Given
our relationship, our history it doesn't make sense." Sam leaned
across the table and put her hand on Brooke's.  They both tried to
ignore the jolt of energy that ran from their hands through their
arms and then throughout their entire bodies.  Since Sam's `looking
for trouble' comment, the bra and Milo incidents the day before, they
were both treading lightly, afraid of crossing some invisible line.</p>

<p>"The word history alludes to the past, as in over and done with.
Whatever our relationship was, as rivals or enemies or whatever, it
had changed.  Our families had come together whether we liked it or
not and as much as I like the thought of having the bathroom to
myself, I would never, read: EVER, wish any harm to come to you."</p>

<p>"Is that why?" Brooke asked sounding like a very frightened child in
the middle of a thunderstorm.</p>

<p>"Brooke, everything happened so fast that I had no chance to think
about why.  I just saw the car and reacted.  There is no why.  I
couldn't let you get hit.  I didn't think about the consequences." A
few tears ran silently down Brooke's face.  "I'm sorry if that's hard
to live with, Brooke.  I never thought about what it must be like for
you.  I should have."</p>

<p>&lt;Or I could tell you the truth and tell you I love you and would
gladly die in your place if that's what it took to keep you safe.
No, I think my answer is enough&gt;</p>

<p>"Me?  Sam, if it hadn't been for you I'd be dead.  That's all there
is to it," Brooke said simply through her tears.  Sam shook her head.</p>

<p>"But you're not and neither am I.  But what I meant was I didn't
think about what it was like for you to live with seeing that.  I
know you have the nightmares and I'm sorry," she apologized as she
realized that while she had the physical scars, they both shared the
emotional ones.  Brooke looked away.</p>

<p>"Don't apologize for saving my life, Sam.  I'm just so sorry that you
had to chose between your life and mine.  It never should have
happened," Brooke responded looking at the floor.  It wasn't a memory
she liked to think about but it was one she relived every day and
dreamed each night.</p>

<p>"You're right, it shouldn't have.  But thanks to Nicole it did.  But
Brooke, what I don't understand is why you don't seem to think your
life was worth saving.  It was, it still is.  I don't regret, for a
single instant the choice I made.  Sure I could have done without the
pain and crap that went with it but given the choice between that or
a life without you in it, cut off my legs and cut out my tongue and
call me a happy person.  At least we'd both still be alive."</p>

<p>"Sam," Brooke sighed still not looking up.</p>

<p>"Hey, look at me," Sam commanded gently.  Brooke looked up
slowly.  "Still here, Brooke and I'm not going anywhere anytime
soon.  Chair notwithstanding and I still wouldn't go anywhere if I
weren't literally a fifth wheel.  Or in this case two very large
ones."</p>

<p>"Why do you do that?" Brooke asked slightly annoyed.</p>

<p>"Oh, more questions.  What?" </p>

<p>"Joke.  When things get serious you joke.  Why do you do that?"</p>

<p>"Because I suck at emotional exchanges?" Sam asked, only half-kidding.</p>

<p>"Fair enough," Brooke agreed.  "So, we have no reason why you shoved
me out of the way, just that you reacted.  And I have no way of ever
repaying you for that." Sam shook her head.</p>

<p>"You don't have to, Brooke.  I didn't do it because I wanted
something in return.  I had no ulterior motive.  I told you, I had no
time to think about what I was doing, I just reacted.  Besides,
you've been more to me, done more for me than I could have ever asked
you to since then.  You have been right there, through it all, good
and bad, holding my hand and telling me it was going to be all
right.  You never left me and I can never pay you back for that."</p>

<p>"Consider us even then?" &lt;Although, Sam, I can never truly repay you
for all you've given me&gt;</p>

<p>"You bet!  Now, can we finish lunch because I'm still hungry," Sam
begged, reaching for her sandwich again.</p>

<p>"You and your stomach!  Now I know where Mac gets her appetite from,"
Brooke joked.</p>

<p>"I'll have you know I am a growing girl," Sam informed her haughtily.</p>

<p>"God, into what?" Brooke asked fearfully.  Sam arched an eyebrow and
frowned.</p>

<p>"Oh, keep it up and we'll see who gets to pick out what movie we
watch tonight, missy," Brooke's eyes widened.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, please, anything but that.  Please don't make me watch
Coyote Ugly, AGAIN!"</p>

<p>"Hey, it's better than The Skulls."</p>

<p>"Hey, I liked that movie!" Brooke argued.</p>

<p>"You just like to watch Paul Walker," Sam countered.  Brooke
shrugged. "Can I ask you a question now, Brooke?" Sam asked suddenly
serious.  Brooke nodded.  "What's with the calling me `Sammy'?  I
don't mind it, really.  It's just something usually reserved for a
parent or someone really close to me to call me." Brooke looked away
hurt.</p>

<p>"And you don't think I'm close to you," she said more as a statement
than as a question. &lt;Oh, that stung&gt; Brooke thought.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean it like that.  I meant close to me emotionally.  I
know I'm not the most emotionally available person Brooke, and when
you call me Sammy it sounds so sweet, so intimate.  I don't know, I
just wanted to know why you call me that sometimes," she looked away,
embarrassed.</p>

<p>"Because I do feel close to you Sammy.  Emotionally.  How can I not
after everything that's happened?  You're my hero, Sammy.  Without
you, I'd be a footnote on the memorial page of the yearbook.  You're
my best friend, my antithesis, my stepsister, my rival, my savior and
my saint all in one package.  I'm sorry if that sounds a little corny
but it's how I feel.  When I call you Sammy it's my way of keeping
you closer than anyone else because I know it's a name reserved for
those closest to you.  But I'll stop if it bothers you."  Sam wiped
away the tears that had fallen down her face as she listened to
Brooke's explaination.  That girl never ceased to surprise or touch
her like no other.  Everyday her love for her grew deeper.</p>

<p>"Please don't stop.  I like hearing it from you, really, Brooke.
Especially if that's why you do it.  I just wanted to know why is
all," she looked back up at Brooke and Brooke knew that she meant it.</p>

<p>"OK, Sammy.  Pass the dressing, please," Sam complied and they ate in
compatible silence.  </p>
