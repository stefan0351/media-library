<!-- Brooke, Sam, And God (Or God Has A Wicked Sense Of Humor) -->

<p>Brooke suddenly found herself standing in the empty hospital
room alone.  There was an empty bed a few feet away but no machines
chirping or beeping, no ventilator whirring and most importantly, no
Sam.  Terror lanced through her entire body, as she feared that Sam
had died.</p>

<p>"Sam?  Oh God, where are you Sam?" she called out to the
empty room, unable to move as she was frozen in place by her fear.</p>

<p>"Sam's not here right now but I can take a message and maybe
she'll get back to you.  Although I wouldn't hold my breath," a
soothing voice came from behind Brooke causing her to spin around.
There stood a woman with long red hair and a kind face.  It took a
minute but after studying the person in front of her, Brooke realized
who it was from Harrison's description.</p>

<p>"You're, you're God," Brooke gasped in disbelief.  God nodded.</p>

<p>"Yup.  In the not so solid flesh, as it were.  Have a seat,
Brooke, we need to talk."  Brooke sat down on the edge of the bed and
faced God.  She didn't know what to do, cry or laugh. &lt;Harrison was
right, how strange is that?&gt;</p>

<p>"I called you here to talk, Brooke," God started.</p>

<p>"About Sam?" Brooke asked, afraid that God was going to tell
her that Sam was going to die.  God nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sam.  And a few other things too, but most importantly
Sam.  Do you know why I didn't appear to you that night Harrison
tried to bring you to me?" Brooke shook her head.  "Because you
didn't need me.  You had your guidance, your center, whether you
realized it or not.  You eventually swore over Harrison's frail and
sick body to recover.  I knew that you were going to be able to make
the choice to recover on your own.  Simply put, you didn't need me at
that point in time."</p>

<p>"But I do need you now.  Please don't let my Sammy die,"
Brooke begged near tears.  Somewhere in her mind Brooke repeated the
phrase `my Sammy' in confusion but ignored it for now.  God held up
her hand to silence the young girl.</p>

<p>"Believe it or not, the decision is out of my hands now,"
Brooke arched an eyebrow in question.</p>

<p>"You're God, how can it be out of your hands?  You've `got
the whole world in your hands'," Brooke pointed out using the lyrics
to the old song.  God smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do.  But I lost control of the situation the second
Sam put herself in front of that car.  You know what I love about
humans, Brooke?" Brooke shook her head.  "Free will.  It is what sets
you apart from everything else, the ability to make your own
decisions. It's what makes you unique.  It's also what makes you
unpredictable and not a little uncontrollable at times.  Sam chose to
push you out of the way and get hit, I didn't make her do that."</p>

<p>"So I was supposed to die?" Brooke asked fearful.  &lt;Was God
here to claim me?&gt; God shook her head.</p>

<p>"Yes and no.  I know the doctor said that no one would have
survived being hit head on at that speed but I'm God, what does he
know?  This was meant to do several things.  It was meant to
strengthen your family and bring you together; it was to solidify
your relationship with Sam only right now you have the roles
reversed."</p>

<p>"Relationship?  We're good friends now and I think we'll make
great sisters," Brooke deflected the comment nonchalantly.  God
raised an eyebrow in the `Nice try' gesture and smiled.</p>

<p>"You know what I mean.  You feel more for that girl than you
think you should.  More than the Bible says is right.  Phoey.  What
does your heart tell you, Brooke?  And don't embarrass yourself by
trying to lie, I'm God, I made you.  I'll know."  Brooke took a deep
breath, jumped off the edge and spoke her heart.  She figured if she
couldn't be honest with God, she had bigger problems than she thought.</p>

<p>"I think that love is colorblind, that's for sure.  But I
think it's gender blind too.  I think that true love just is.  It
doesn't care what society or religion thinks or says is right, it
only cares what your heart and soul tell you is right and what makes
you feel complete."</p>

<p>"What I feel for Sam is different than what I've ever felt for
someone before.  I look forward to seeing her just to see her and how
it makes me feel.  I want to hear her talk to know what she thinks
and what she feels.  I don't care what we do when we're together just
so long as she's there.  I get excited just thinking about being near
her and I look forward to just telling her about my day.  I need to
see her, hear her voice, her laugh, everything about her just fills
me with this feeling I can't describe.  I guess what I'm trying to
say is that she makes me feel that no matter what else is wrong in my
life, if she's there, everything is right.  I love her with every
fiber of my being and if that doesn't jive with society, tough." God
smiled widely.</p>

<p>"Very well spoken, Brooke.  I'm proud of you," Brooke blushed
under the praise (this is God, after all) but then turned serious
again.</p>

<p>"But what about Sam?  Will she make it?" God sighed.</p>

<p>"I don't know.  I know, not very reassuring to hear that from
God, but what can I say?  Sam holds her cards very close to her
chest.  She's a tricky one, that girl.  Whether she pulls through
this or not is entirely up to her at this point.  I can't push things
either way.  It's kind of frustrating actually.  I like Sam, I've got
plans for her, and you."</p>

<p>"If you can't help Sam, and you want me to accept my feelings
for her, OK.  But why else did you do this?  Why did Nicole try to
kill me?"</p>

<p>"Redemption," God said simply.</p>

<p>"OK, not following," Brooke pointed out.</p>

<p>"Everyone deserves a chance at redemption, Brooke.  Even
Nicole Julian."</p>

<p>"She's not getting one this time, God.  She had one that time
she got the cat for Nurse Glass at Christmas or donated bone marrow
for Harrison and saved him.  She's all out of `Get out of Jail Free'
cards in my opinion."</p>

<p>"Those were small steps, Brooke.  Whether you want to believe
it or not, Nicole carries a lot of emotional baggage around with her
and it gets in the way of her better judgement most of the time."</p>

<p>"How do you find redemption when you tried to run down your
best friend with your Jaguar while you were totally tanked?" Brooke
asked frustrated and angry.  God shrugged.</p>

<p>"That struggle is part of her journey and yours and Sam's.
Nicole had to hit rock bottom before she could begin her true journey
on the right path.  Besides, sometimes you find redemption and
forgiveness in the strangest places."</p>

<p>"This is so not making me feel better," Brooke sighed.  God
laughed.</p>

<p>"Relax Brooke, you're doing everything you can to help Sam.
If it makes you feel any better I'll let you in on a little secret.
She /can/ hear you.  Every word you say, every one of your emotions,
are a part of what is keeping her soul anchored to her body.  Your
voice, Brooke, your love.  Keep talking to her, but don't push her.
Maybe she'll come back to you."</p>

<p>"Maybe?  You're God and the best you can give me is `maybe'?"
Brooke asked incredulously, thinking somewhere in the back of her
mind that maybe getting snotty with God wasn't the smartest idea but,
oh well, too late now.</p>

<p>"Hey, even I rested on the seventh day.  I may be perfect and
all knowing, but Sam's somewhere she doesn't want to leave right
now.  Give her time, though.  She might change her mind." Brooke's
eyes got wide with realization.</p>

<p>"Do you know where she is?  Can I talk to her?" God thought a
minute.</p>

<p>"That would break a lot of rules," God said.  Brooke frowned.</p>

<p>"You wrote the rules, didn't you?" God grinned.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I suppose I did.  I know where she is and I will let
you see her, but I have a few conditions.  It's only for a few
minutes and don't tell her too much of what we've said here.  And you
can't force her to come back if she doesn't want to."</p>

<p>"Deal," Brooke said happily.   God motioned to the door and
it opened, revealing a lush green pasture lying beyond it.  "It's
beautiful," Brooke breathed in awe.  </p>

<p>"Yes, it is.  Now go," God ushered Brooke though the door.  "Go find
her but only a couple of minutes, OK?" Brooke nodded and before she
could say `Thank you', the door shut, disappeared and left her in the
field.</p>

<p>"Sam?" she called.  "Sammy you out here?"</p>

<p>"She's over there by the river," a male voice came from behind her.
Brooke turned to face a man she'd seen only in a photograph.  Joe
McPherson.  He smiled brightly at her and gave her a huge hug.  "She
doesn't belong here, Brooke but she won't listen to me.  Maybe she'll
listen to you, you're all she talks about."</p>

<p>"I'm pleased to meet you," Brooke managed to say.  Joe had the same
warm eyes Sam did and they twinkled at her as he spoke.</p>

<p>"And I an honored to meet someone my daughter obviously cares enough
for to risk her life," he told her.  Brooke looked away, suddenly
unable to meet his friendly gaze.</p>

<p>"You're not mad, are you?" she asked in a small voice.</p>

<p>"Of course not, Brooke.  Sammy was doing what came naturally to her.
There's no one to blame especially not you," Joe told her warmly.</p>

<p>"Is this Heaven?" he shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, because neither Sam nor you are dead.  I'm here because Sam
needed me.  This is sort of an in-between place, I guess."</p>

<p>"It's beautiful," Brooke repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is.  I used to take Sam out hiking to a place very much like
this when she was little, which is why, I suppose, we're here.  Now
come on, you're wasting time." He led her over to where Sam sat
beside the stream, dangling her legs in the water and watching her
reflection.  Brooke sat down next to Sam who looked up for a second
and smiled before looking back at the water.</p>

<p>"I miss you," Brooke said simply to start.  Sam nodded.</p>

<p>"Miss you too.  You OK?"</p>

<p>"Yup, a few scrapes and bruises.  I think you missed out in a career
in hockey or roller derby, although it's something to think about if
the whole writing thing doesn't pan out." Sam smiled.</p>

<p>"I'll keep that in mind.  Everyone else OK?"</p>

<p>"We're fine, but we miss you terribly.  Life isn't the same without
you.  No one to fight with over the bathroom, no one mocking my
choice in friends or my cheerleading outfit, no one to trick into
changing Mac's diaper for me," Brooke joked.  She watched as
different scenes from shared experiences reflected back at them in
the water.</p>

<p>There were scenes from the Novak, the night Mike and Jane surprised
them with the news of their relationship at the party, being in Bio
Glass's class together, the first argument over the bathroom, one of
the spectacular food fights in the lunch room, more miscellaneous
scenes and then finally, the prom all floated past them in vivid
color.  Brooke watched them all with interest wondering what they
meant.  Some were significant, she remembered them, but others
weren't but they must have meaning to Sam, she figured.</p>

<p>"What's all this?" Brooke asked pointing to the scenes.  Sam looked
at her and shrugged.</p>

<p>"Memories, I guess.  Just stuff I was thinking about," Sam explained
softly.</p>

<p>"We've been through a lot of crap, haven't we?"</p>

<p>"Yeah, we have.  I wouldn't trade a minute of it, though.  Would
you?" Sam asked as she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear.
Brooke shook her head.</p>

<p>"Not for anything," Brooke said honestly.  They sat quietly for a few
minutes watching scenes from their life pass by.</p>

<p>"I don't wanna go back," Sam said suddenly, looking for the entire
world like a lost two-year-old.  Brooke wrapped her arms around Sam's
shoulders and pulled her close.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Cuz my Dad's here and I miss him," Sam said as she started to cry.
Brooke let Sam rest her head on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"I know you do Sammy, but you don't belong here, you know that.  Your
Dad knows that too.  Nice guy, by the way, I met him.  But think of
your poor mom, Sam.  You are all Jane has left of Joe, Sam.  A small,
living piece of her first true love.  Proof that all the pain was
worth it.  You cash out now and she has nothing."</p>

<p>"That's not fair, she has you and Mike and Mac," Sam argued as she
wiped away a few tears and sniffed.</p>

<p>"But we're not you.  We're not Sam.  As much as I know Jane loves me
as a daughter, I will never `be' her daughter.  And as much as Mac is
her daughter, you are her first born. She needs you, Sam.  We all do."</p>

<p>"But it's going to hurt," Sam told her pitifully.  Brooke's heart
broke at the realization that Sam was right and she wondered if maybe
wanting Sam to come back knowing that the pain was going to be
unbearable wasn't somehow wrong, selfish even.  Joe appeared a few
feet away and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Pain is temporary, Sam," he said quietly.  "Love is forever."  Sam
raised her head and regarded him quizzically.</p>

<p>"When did you become a badly written Hallmark card?" This made them
all laugh.  </p>

<p>"Brooke knows what I mean.  You will too, Sammy.  Soon."  Sam looked
back and forth between her father and Brooke a few times trying to
understand.  They just smiled at her.  Joe looked away for a second
and then looked back at Brooke. </p>

<p>"Time's almost up," Brooke nodded and turned back to Sam.</p>

<p>"Look, Sam, you have to come back.  I know it's going to be painful
for you and while I can't even begin to fathom how bad it's going to
be you're not going to go through it alone.  Come back because I
can't stand to watch you lie there in that bed not moving.  Come back
because I'm selfish and want someone to talk to, argue with, watch
Mac grow with, and do all the stupid things we were supposed to do
with.  Come back because I can't imagine my life without you in it."</p>

<p>"You finally admit you're selfish and I'm in a coma, gee, thanks,"
Sam chided making Brooke laugh.  "Remind me to get hit by a car more
often."</p>

<p>"Wake up and I'll say it again," Brooke promised with a smile.</p>

<p>"Will I remember any of this?" Sam asked.  Brooke looked at Joe.</p>

<p>"Some," he said.  "You both will remember what's important, the
emotions.  You've really got to get going, Brooke."</p>

<p>"OK.  Coming home soon, Sam?" she asked as she stood up.  Sam watched
her go and shrugged.</p>

<p>"Maybe.  I'll think about it but I can't make any promises.  Keep
talking to me, though.  I like hearing your voice, Brooke.  It's
soothing.  Feels like home." Brooke bent down and hugged Sam before
giving her a light kiss on the forehead.</p>

<p>"Come home to me, Sammy," she whispered, her voice thick with
unspoken emotion.  "I love you," she ventured, needing to take the
chance and tell Sam now before it was too late.  Just in case Sam
didn't come home to her.  The field and Sam started to fade away in
front of Brooke but just before it disappeared completely, she heard
the whispered response.</p>

<p>"I love you too, Brooke."</p>

<p>Brooke woke up with such a start that she nearly fell out of her
chair.  She was back in Sam's hospital room and nothing had changed.
Brooke studied the motionless figure in front of her for any hint of
change but could find none.  She settled back into her seat for a few
minutes, thinking over the dream.  Then she started talking again.
Sam had asked her too, after all.</p>
