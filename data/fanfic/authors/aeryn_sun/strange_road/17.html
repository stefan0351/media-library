<p>"You were never a Girl Scout," she harassed after Mike and Jane left
the room.  Brooke looked back at her indignant.</p>

<p>"Was too.  I was a Brownie and then a Girl Scout.  I even made Junior
Leader before I left.  Why?  Jealous?"  Sam stuck out her chin and
shook her hed in defiance.</p>

<p>"No," she answered simply.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Sam?  Weren't you a Girl Scout?"</p>

<p>"I was a Brownie…for a while," Sam hedged.  Brooke grinned.  &lt;This
was going to be good&gt;</p>

<p>"What did you do?" she asked.  Sam flushed red and looked at the
floor.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't like to be laughed at, you know that, right?" Brooke
nodded.</p>

<p>"I know that fact very intimately," she pointed out.</p>

<p>"Yeah, well," Sam continued.  "There was this boy, Boy Scout
actually, who made fun of my beanie.  You know, the little brown
thingie you wear on your head?"</p>

<p>"I remember it."</p>

<p>"Well, he took it off my head and threw it in the boys bathroom when
we were six.  Didn't stop me from going after it, though.  And
beating the crud out of him afterward." Brooke burst out laughing at
the image of an indignant Sam McPherson going into the boy's bathroom
at six years old to retrieve her Brownie beanie.  "They threw me out
of Scouts for that."</p>

<p>"Well, he deserved to get beat up," Brooke laughed when Sam finished
her story.  Sam shrugged as she laughed too.</p>

<p>"Yeah, well, to hear Harrison tell the story, he says I overreacted
and didn't beat him up too bad." Brooke started laughing again.</p>

<p>"Oh, God, I think I remember that!  He was mortified that he was
beaten up by a girl!  That was you!  I told him then that he deserved
it." Sam smiled.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she responded.  She looked at the clock.  "We'd better
get a move on if we're going to make it to the rehab center on time."</p>

<p>"All right, off to the showers with you, Sam," Brooke ordered
sternly.  "There will be no slacking off because the parentals are
out of town."</p>

<p>"My, my.  So demanding.  If you wanted to see me in the buff, just
ask, Brooke.  No need to get bossy," Sam tsked making Brooke drop the
dish in her hand which thankfully didn't break.  She stared at Sam
incredulously.  Sam shrugged.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Comments like that could seriously lead to trouble," Brooke said in
all seriousness while turning away from Sam.  Sam contemplated this
for a minute.</p>

<p>"What if I'm looking for trouble?" she challenged back.  Brooke
honestly had no response.</p>

<p>"Suit yourself, Sam," was all she managed.</p>

<p>"Thanks, I think I will."</p>

<p>"Sam," Brooke started her tone warning.  She turned around but Sam
had already wheeled away to the bathroom.  Brooke sighed.  Things
were getting more and more complicated faster than she could keep
up.  And Sam wasn't helping any.</p>

<p>&lt;What the Hell is going on between us?  Her comments lately have been
more than friendly flirting, they've bordered on the outright
suggestive.  Could Sam have feelings for me like I do for her?  She
was pressed up pretty close to me this morning and she leaned into my
hand when I wiped away her tears.  And she wiped away mine last
night.  This is more than just friendship or sisterly bonding going
on, I know it.  But, what if I'm reading more into it than it
actually is?&gt;</p>

<p>Brooke's head swimmed with thoughts that she couldn't straighten
out.  There was no doubt in her mind now that she desperately loved
Sam, from the tips of her toes to the top of her head, every once of
her being was consumed by her feelings for Sam.  She wanted nothing
more than to tell Sam how she felt but fear of rejection and losing
the close relationship they now had stopped her.  She figured if she
was wrong and Sam was just playing and didn't feel the same way, that
Sam would be insulted by Brooke's feelings and revert to the
vindictive hurtful ways they used to act towards each other.  And
Brooke knew that that would destroy her.</p>

<p>&lt;I'm finally getting to know her, beyond the walls, barriers and
façade that Sam created to protect her emotions after her dad died.
Maybe what I see as feelings for me is just how she really is, her
real emotions that she doesn't let anyone see and not anything more
than that.  And if I tell her that I love her and she doesn't feel
the same, I might lose everything&gt;</p>

<p>A few errant tears slipped down Brooke's face into the sink as she
tried to sort out her thoughts.  Anyway she tried, she couldn't get
the answer she wanted, wouldn't let herself have the answer she
wanted.  Pushing away from the sink, she went to get dressed and
start her day, another day quietly pining for whom and what she knew
she could never have.</p>
