<p>"Sam, I swear to God you should see her!  It looks like Jennifer
Lopez and Antonio Bandarez had a love child and FuBu exploded all
over her!" Carmen joked, telling Sam all about B. Ho.  Lily,
Harrison, Brooke and Josh all laughed as Sam smiled and nodded, not
really feeling up to laughing even if the imagery was rather
humorous.  Truthfully, she wanted to be left alone.  As much as she
loved her friends, she didn't want them to see her like this.
&lt;Handicapped and silent&gt; &lt;Crippled and mute&gt; &lt;Physically disabled
and voiceless&gt; &lt;Paralysed and dumb&gt; &lt;Paraplegic and aphonic&gt; Her
still active and vocabulary rich mind continued to mock her in its
abitity to remind her of her condition. </p>

<p> Everytime she opened her mouth to speak, she sounded like a bad
Elmer Fudd impersonator and she hated it. And that was when the right
words came out.  Despite the doctor's reassurance that it was most
likely temporary, Sam was despondant.  Words were her thing, her
element and the thing she knew best.  Now thanks to a broken arm and
a head injury, they were taken away from her.  She felt isolated,
lost and scared.</p>

<p>"So then, Mary Cherry comes in with her father," Carmen continued
with her retelling of how Mary Cherry had returned to school a few
days after being `rescued' from the orphanage by her father Sweet
Honey Chile.  "And his outfit, I mean, I had no idea they made that
sort of thing in that size."</p>

<p>Everyone, save Sam, laughed again at the memory but only Brooke
noticed the lack of reaction from Sam.  She knew that Sam was having
trouble dealing with the extent of her injuries but didn't know how
to help.  She reached out and grasped Sam's good hand in her own and
gave it a reassuring squeeze.  Sam looked up and rewarded Brooke with
a small, half-hearted smile.  But the sadness and fear in Sam's eyes
nearly broke Brooke's heart.  There was also a pleading look there
that Brooke understood having seen it all too often lately.</p>

<p>"Hey, guys, I think maybe Sam's had enough for today.  What do you
think, Sam?" Sam's eyes lit up and she shook her head as hard as she
dared, given the fact she just emerged from a coma a few days
earlier.  Brooke smiled at her.</p>

<p>"Aw, gee, Sam, we're sorry.  We just missed you so much," Harrison
told her softly.  Sam smiled in understanding.  She didn't dare try
and speak.  "Hang in there, you," he said as he kissed her softly on
the cheek.</p>

<p>"Yeah, Sam, we've got a lot of catching up to do," Lily added as she
hugged Sam gently.  Carmen and Josh said goodbye as Brooke ushered
them all out the door.</p>

<p>"We'll talk to you guys tomorrow," Brooke winced at her choice of
words as she said goodbye.  Seeing that Jane had gone home for
dinner, Brooke closed the door and resumed her place sitting on Sam's
bed.  Sam mouthed a `thank you' at her and leaned back on the bed.</p>

<p>"Not a problem, Sam.  Anything for you," Sam quirked an eyebrow and
the corner of her mouth twitched upward slightly.  "Get your mind out
of the gutter, Sam," Brooke scolded Sam even as she felt a slight
blush rise to her cheeks.  Her mind dove into the gutter too even if
she had meant the comment innocently enough.  &lt;Oh, Sam, if you only
knew&gt;</p>

<p>Sam, for her part, was thinking along the same lines.  If only Brooke
knew how Sam was really feeling towards her.  &lt;But then&gt; Sam
reasoned, &lt;why would someone as beautiful, smart, funny, and caring
as Brooke be interested in someone who's handicapped when they could
have anyone they wanted?  Not to mention the whole `straight' thing.
Yeah, there's a sticking point for you.  Face facts, Sammy, with or
without your legs or voice, Brooke is never going to be anything more
than a good friend, if you're lucky.  So just forget about anything
else&gt;</p>

<p>Brooke watched the shadow pass over Sam's face and it disturbed her.
Since she had witnessed her wake up, Brooke had also had a front row
seat for Sam's withdrawl into herself and nothing Brooke said or did
seemed to slow it down.  If anything, it seemed to Brooke that Sam's
inabilitiy to speak was doing what Nicole and two and a half tons of
metal and steel couldn't: kill Sam.  For every word Sam was unable to
utter and was forced to contain within herself, it seemed like a
piece of her soul was ripped away.  Brooke always knew that words
were important to Sam, she was only now discovering exactly how much.</p>

<p>"They mean well, Sam.  And they're really happy that you're awake,"
Brooke said to break the silence that was starting to stretch between
them.  Sam rolled her eyes and sighed before settling further into
her bed.  Brooke grabbed her hand again causing her to open her eyes
to look at her.  Brooke, realizing she'd unconsciously taken hold of
Sam's hand again, started to let go, embarrassed before Sam tightened
her own hold to stop her.</p>

<p>"Sorry," Brooke apologized with a small smile, "habit."  Sam shrugged
one shoulder but returned the smile, albeit marginally.  Brooke
sighed lightly.  "Talk to me, Sammy, I need to hear your voice."  Sam
frowned and turned her head away.</p>

<p>"Don't Sam, don't shut me out, please," Brooke begged.  Sam didn't
turn back but stayed facing the wall.  "Sam, speak to me.  I went so
long without hearing your voice.  Please say something."</p>

<p>"Woof," Sam spit out bitterly, still facing the wall.  Brooke closed
her eyes and sighed in defeat.  Sam's stubborn streak had always been
a thorn in Brooke's side, nevermore so than now.  All she wanted was
to help Sam but she wouldn't let her.  But she wasn't going to give
up.  Quitting was not a trait Brooke McQueen wanted to be known for.</p>

<p>"Fine, Sam, I'll let it go for now.  But I'm not giving up on you and
I'm not going anywhere so forget about that.  I didn't sit here
everyday with you, begging you to wake up so that you could shut me
out.  It doesn't work that way so get used to having me here, whether
you want me here or not," Brooke explained, her voice never wavering
from the gentle tone she started with.  Getting angry wouldn't solve
anything; it would only make things worse.  Besides, she knew that
eventually Sam had to come around again.  Her `visit' with God told
Brooke that there was something else for them both in the future,
even if she was fuzzy on the details.</p>

<p>Brooke hadn't told Harrison or Sam about her vision of God or the
visit with Sam and Joe yet, she wasn't sure if it was real or a dream
caused by grief and lack of sleep.  Actually, if she was honest with
herself, she knew it was real and she had a lot of thinking to do
about the whole thing.  But right now, her only concern was Sam and
getting her to open up and accept the help that was being offered.
&lt;But, given Sam's less than sunny disposition since waking up and
discovering her condition that may be easier said than done&gt;</p>

<p>Still, the fact that the other girl still hadn't let go of her hand
told Brooke that Sam wanted the help but didn't know how to ask.  Sam
was a solitary creature by nature and it was hard for her to admit
weakness.  Brooke knew Sam was scared, who wouldn't be after all.
Sam had lost three weeks time thanks to Nicole and her little drunken
game of bumper tag.</p>

<p>"If you don't want to talk, fine, I will.  I got another call from
the State's Attorney today.  Nicole's case goes to court soon," this
got Sam's attention and she rolled over to look at Brooke.  "She's
being charged with possession of alcohol by a minor, driving while
intoxicated, attempted vehicler manslaughter, and reckless driving.
I've already given my statement as to what happened that night but I
might have to testify.  The prosecutor says he might cut a deal but I
swear to you Sammy that Nicole will not get away with what she did."
Sam blinked at her and then shrugged.  Brooke frowned.</p>

<p>"Sam, don't you care that she get what she deserves?  Jesus, she
nearly killed you, and she could have killed me.  You don't want her
to just walk away scott-free do you?"  Again Sam just shrugged like
she could care less.  And she couldn't.  Whether or not Nicole went
to juvie or paid a fine or whatnot had absolutely no baring on her
life right now whatsoever.  All Sam cared about was whether or not
she was going to walk and talk again.  &lt;It's the little things&gt; Sam
sighed to herself.</p>

<p>Brooke on the other hand, wanted nothing more than to personally
throw the switch on Nicole's electric chair.  As a matter of fact,
she'd entertained many a fantasy about the many painful ways there
was to kill Nicole during her time at Sam's silent bedside.  She'd
shared these ideas with Sam's quiet presence as well.  It was one of
her new hobbies.  Revenge and pain for Nicole.  Brooke knew that it
wasn't the healthiest of hobbies to have but it kept her happy and
occupied when Sam was in her coma.  And her visit with Nicole a week
or so earlier had only served to deepen her anger when she was
actually looking for some sort of closure.  But the moment she saw
Nicole, Brooke also saw Sam, the moment the car hit her and the anger
overwhelmed her.</p>

<p>"I can't believe you, of all people, aren't for going after her with
both barrels, Sam.  She should get the harshest punishment possible.
I'm talking drawn and quartered, the guillotine, made to wear Kathie
Lee fashions, and last years at that," Brooke said frustrated.  Sam
looked at her incredulously.  Even without being able to say a word,
Brooke knew what she was saying.</p>

<p>"I know, I know.  `But she's Nicole Julian.  She'll get away with it
because of who she is and her family's money.'  But that's not right,
Sam.  It's not fair," Brooke complained.  Sam nodded in agreement
even as she sat in amazement at how well Brooke had been able to read
her thoughts.  Brooke ran a hand through her hair.</p>

<p>"I think I finally understand how you must have felt all this time,
how everything just seemed so against you, the one everyone sees
as `unpopular' and me, the one everyone sees as `popular'.  Because
Nic is one of the `rich, pretty, popular' pod people she's going to
get away with a horrible and heinous crime, isn't she?" Sam nodded
sadly.  Brooke sighed.  She hated this because she knew it was
probably the truth.  Regardless of the outcome, she was going to do
whatever she could to see that Nicole was punished and that Sam
recovered.  It was the least she could do to try and alieviate the
overwhelming guilt that she felt towards the entire situation and her
part in it.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know about you but I've had enough with talking about
that psycho hose beast.  What do you want to do now?" Sam rolled her
eyes.  "I realize that our activites are severely limited but there's
got to be something."  Sam closed her eyes and sighed.</p>

<p>"No, Sam, you can't go back to sleep.  The doctors are worried that
you're sleeping too much, it's a sign of depression," Brooke
explained patiently.  Sam opened her eyes and glared at the form
sitting on her bed.</p>

<p>"Glare all you want to, Sam, you don't scare me.  What are you going
to do, beat me over the head with your cast?  I think not.  Live with
the fact that I'm not going anywhere.  Move over, I think Passions is
on.  Let's see what Tabitha and Timmy are up to."</p>
