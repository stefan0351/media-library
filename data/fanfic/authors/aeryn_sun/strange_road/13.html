<p>"When you told Eric you could `handle' me, I had no idea you
meant literally," Sam joked as Brooke set her on the workout mat a
few days later.  Brooke rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>"Very funny, McPherson.  How's the knee?" she asked referring
to the newly free from its brace left knee.  Sam flexed the knee
experiementally and shrugged.  </p>

<p>"Peachy, I guess.  You know when I first woke up from the
coma, I thought I resembled a mummy there were so many bandages and
casts on me.  It's nice to start getting some of them taken off."
Brooke smiled as she started Sam's exercises.</p>

<p>"Yeah, you looked like one for a while there too," Brooke
agreed.  Sam returned the smile and began the routine.</p>

<p>"Did you ever think we'd end up here?  In a situation like
this, I mean?" Brooke frowned.</p>

<p>"I never thought Nicole would ever try to kill me, no."</p>

<p>"I meant like this, working together to help the other.  The
situation itself is kind of extreme.  I never thought Nic was insane
enough to try and kill you either, even if I did think she was off
her rocker most of the time.  I just meant did you ever think we'd
get along this well?" </p>

<p>"Oh.  Well, I always thought that we didn't have to be
enemies, Sam.  It never seemed like something we wanted.  Was it?"
Sam shrugged.</p>

<p>"I don't know anymore if it was what I wanted to do or what
was expected of me because it was a part I played for so long.  You?"
Brooke nodded.</p>

<p>"Same here.  It's the same as being popular.  Everyone
expects a certain something, behavior from you whether it's the true
you or not.  I never hated you, Sam, not really.  I always thought
that we could be friends, or at least get along.  Something just
always got in our way.  Whether it was Nicole, pride, expectations or
our own mistakes, there was always something."</p>

<p>"Ouch," Sam interrupted breaking Brooke's train of
thought.  "Leg cramp."</p>

<p>"OK, take it easy, stretch it out," Brooke advised as Sam
stretched the offending limb out and attempted to scratch around the
cast on the other foot.</p>

<p>"This is ridiculous, you know.  One leg in a cast, one newly
free from a brace, an arm in a brace and stuck in a wheelchair.  I
feel like Timmy from South Park."</p>

<p>"Maybe, but you're much cuter with a larger vocabulary,"
Brooke reassured her.  Sam clutched her arms to her chest in
a `Timmy' imitation.</p>

<p>"Sam-my," she uttered to finish her `Timmy' imitation. (A/N:
if you've never seen Timmy on South Park, sorry, but it's a funny
visual).  Brooke burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"Stop, you're too funny," she wheezed after she finished
laughing.  "Back to work if you want to be able to use a cane by the
time school starts.  Unless you want to run people over in the
halls." Sam seemed to think this over.</p>

<p>"Can I run over Emory Dick and April Tuna first?" Brooke
wagged her finger at her.</p>

<p>"Not nice, Samantha.  What did they ever do to you?" Sam
arched an eyebrow.</p>

<p>"Want a list?"</p>

<p>"What ever happened to the nice, sweet, Sam McPherson who I
used to know?" Brooke asked mockingly.</p>

<p>"Which Sam McPherson did you know?  I was never nice or sweet
to you, remember?  Evil and harpy-like would be a better
description." Brooke nodded.</p>

<p>"OK, this is true."</p>

<p>"I'm still a charmer though," Sam added with a wry grin.
Brooke rolled her eyes again.</p>

<p>"Be still my beating heart," she said sarcastically.  Sam
shook her head to chase the cobwebs suddenly clouding her brain.
Things with Brooke were just getting too weird.  &lt;Must be the head
injury or meds&gt; she reasoned.  &lt;Kinda fun though, might as well go
with it&gt;</p>

<p>"Oh, you're just saying that to flatter me," she teased.</p>

<p>"No, I'm just trying to make you feel better.  You really are
a harpy," Brooke shot back with a smile.  Sam stuck out her bottom
lip and made it quiver in an imitation of being hurt.  "Oh, no you
don't, point those little `Bambi, who just saw the hunter shoot his
Momma eyes' away from me.  That's not fair," Brooke whined as Sam
continued.  Sam sniffed.</p>

<p>"Saaaammmm," Brooke whined again.  God she hated it when Sam
did that with her eyes, she looked so sweet and loveable with those
big brown eyes of hers that it took every ounce of composure not to
kiss her right there and then.  Of course the giggle fit Sam suddenly
burst into kind of killed that urge too.</p>

<p>"Gotcha," Sam wheezed between giggles.</p>

<p>"You're evil, you know that, right?"</p>

<p>"I try," Sam smirked.</p>

<p>"Stop trying so hard, I think it's a natural talent," Brooke
taunted.  Sam raspberried in her direction.</p>

<p>"I pout in your general direction," Sam said haughtily.  Brooke
scrunched her nose.</p>

<p>"I am so not impressed.  Back to work, McPherson.  Hupt two!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I love it when you get so aggressive," Sam teased, watching a
deep crimson blush creep over Brooke's features and wondering how
such a simple comment could cause it.  Brooke seemed to choke on her
own saliva for a second before responding.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to add an extra set of reps to your routine today or
are you trying to piss me off for fun?" Brooke asked, hiding her
sudden discomfort at Sam's teasing behind misplaced anger.  Sam's
shoulders slumped.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, I was just kidding with you.  I didn't mean to make you
uncomfortable," Brooke looked suitably calmer at this.  "Look, in
case I didn't say it already, thank you for being such a help,
Brooke.  I never would have gotten this far without you." Brooke
smiled her anger and discomfort forgotten.</p>

<p>"You are very welcome, Sam.  It's the least I could do after you
leaped in front of Nicole's car like that.  I never figured you for a
closet superhero," she joked.</p>

<p>&lt;Oh, I'm in the closet all right, but not as a superhero&gt; Sam thought
to herself with a small smile.</p>

<p>"Have you been to see Nic since the accident?" she asked, surprising
Brooke.</p>

<p>"Once, while you were still in a coma," she admitted.  At Sam's
interested look she continued.  "I wanted her to see the damage she'd
done so I took some pictures of you and brought them to her." Sam
looked aptly horrified.</p>

<p>"Ew, morbid much?" she thought a minute.  "Still got the pictures?"
Brookke frowned at her.</p>

<p>"Yeah, some copies.  Why?"</p>

<p>"I wanna see them," Sam explained.</p>

<p>"Ew, Sam.  Now who's being morbid?"</p>

<p>"Hey, I was in a coma, I had no idea what was going on, what I looked
like, that sort of thing.  I'm kinda curious to know.  Curiosity and
all that, you know." Brooke stood up.</p>

<p>"Curiosity killed the cat, Sam," she said as she walked over to her
backpack.  Sam smiled mischievously.</p>

<p>"But satisfaction brought her back," she pointed out as Brooke
returned with a small stack of color photos.</p>

<p>"I'll warn you, you didn't exactly look your best," she handed the
pictures to Sam and watched as Sam flipped through them.  The color
drained from Sam's face and was replaced with a sick greenish color.
Brooke was instantly alarmed.</p>

<p>"You OK, Sam?" Sam nodded.</p>

<p>"Yeah, it just makes it so real.  Right there in vivid technicolor,
you know?" she looked up to meet Brooke's hazel eyes.  "And you sat
with me each day?" Brooke nodded.  "How could you put up with that?
I mean, I look dead, worse than dead, I look like someone forgot to
tell me I was dead." She handed the pictures back to Brooke unable to
look at them anymore.  Brooke put them away.  She sat back down next
to Sam and gave her a quick hug.</p>

<p>"How could I not sit with you after what you did?  I couldn't abandon
you, Sam.  I won't abandon you, ever." Sam shrugged.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sorry you went through all that, Brooke," Brooke opened
her mouth to argue but Sam cut her off.  "So what did Satan have to
say for herself?  Was she sorry she didn't finish the job?  You know
how she hates to leave things half done."</p>

<p>"Actually, she tried to apologize for the whole thing.  She even
managed to squeeze out a few crocodile tears on your behalf," Brooke
told her.  Sam took a minute to digest this tidbit of information.</p>

<p>"Maybe she is genuinely sorry for what she did?" she offered.  Brooke
regarded her like she was an alien just come to Earth.</p>

<p>"What?  Are you crazy?  Nicole Julian has no concept of the meaning
of the word `sorry' or the ramifications of what she did." Sam
shrugged.</p>

<p>"Whatever.  Maybe she does, maybe she doesn't but you can't just
dismiss her Brooke.  Look at us, we did for a long time and we're
nothing like what the other thought we were.  Sometimes you have to
hit rock bottom before you can find true redemption.  And sometimes
you find forgiveness and redemption in the strangest places." Brooke
almost fainted as God's words came back at her out of Sam's unknowing
mouth.</p>

<p>"Are you suggesting we forgive Nicole for this?" Sam raised an
eyebrow and chucked.</p>

<p>"Hell, no, but I am saying that we not automatically discount her
attempt at apology.  She might be genuine.  Stranger things have
happened.  Just look, Josh and Lily got married and Mary Cherry has a
twin.  You never know what could happen.  The world is a crazy, mixed
up place and I gave up trying to figure out what was going to happen
next a while ago."</p>

<p>"OK, I see your point.  Still, she'd better get what's coming to
her," Brooke argued.  Sam agreed.</p>

<p>"Everyone does in some way or another," she said as she stretched her
legs.</p>

<p>"And you deserved this how?" Brooke asked a little hotly.  Sam looked
at her confused at the anger behind the question.  A sly smile
crossed her face, she figured the best way to disarm a Brooke bomb
was through humor.</p>

<p>"Unpure, libidinous thoughts?" Brooke laughed outloud although a
blush returned to her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Must have been pretty bad to warrant being run over by a luxury
vehicle." Sam smiled cryptically.</p>

<p>"Yup." &lt;If only you knew, beautiful&gt;</p>
