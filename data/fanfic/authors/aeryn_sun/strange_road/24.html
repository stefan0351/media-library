<!-- I Know What You Really Want For Your Birthday -->


<p>Standing in the kitchen with Mike and Jane, Brooke silently lamented
the absence of her favorite kissing toy, Sam.  Of course, since Mike
and Jane had returned from Utah a few days earlier, the snogging
sessions and heavy petting meetings were much more discreet and quiet
but, still highly enjoyable and high on Brooke's list of favorite
things to do.  And now that it was her birthday, there was really
only one thing she really wanted to do.  Not that she was going to
tell her father and Jane that.</p>

<p>"Happy Birthday, Brooke," Jane beamed as she hugged her
stepdaughter.  There was no doubt in her mind that she loved Brooke
as her own, especially after all that the girl had done for Sam.
Jane knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that without Brooke by her side,
Sam never would have come as far as she had after the accident.  She
was beyond happy that the two girls had gotten past their differences
and were there for one another when it really counted. </p>

<p>"Thanks, Mom," Brooke smiled back, totally comfortable now
with calling Jane Mom.  She was truly the closest thing she'd ever
had and Brooke was now beyond happy that her father had found Jane,
even if it had caused loads of trouble to start.  The end result was
more than worth the strife.  "I just wish Sam was here," she lamented
outloud the absence of the girl who had come to mean so much to her.
More than she was going to admit to Jane, of course.  &lt;At least not
yet&gt; she thought Jane and Mike smiled.</p>

<p>"She'll be here soon, sweetheart," Mike told his daughter.
Like Jane, he was happy that Brooke and Sam got along as well as they
did now.  Unlike Jane, he was unaware that there was something more
going on between the two girls.  Jane had noticed things were a
little different between Sam and Brooke.  She wasn't sure how she
felt about that, given the facts that: 1) they were both girls, 2) it
would make things awkward for the family, 3) it wasn't an easy
lifestyle choice for anyone and she didn't want them to face a
lifetime of stereotypes and hardships if it wasn't `just a phase'
and, 4) how would Mike react?  (Probably not well) But for now, she
was just going to keep an eye on them, make sure things didn't get
out of hand and (gasp) trust them.  If she felt things went too far,
then they'd have to lay down some ground rules and take it from
there.  But Jane wasn't a fool, although Brooke and Sam might
disagree at times (they're teens, it happens), she knew they weren't
kids anymore and shouldn't be treated as such.  Plus, a little voice
in her head kept telling her she was imagining things and she was
more than happy to listen to it.  &lt;Denial, I can do denial&gt;</p>

<p>"Excuse me," a voice spoke up from the doorway.  The three
looked up in shock to see Nicole standing there looking scared.
Brooke tried hard to swallow the rage that flowed up at the very
sight of her former friend.  Mike put his hand on her shoulder in
support.</p>

<p>"Nicole?  How did you get in?" Jane asked, a little curtly.
She had been confused when Sam had sat the family down a few days ago
and explained that she forgave Nicole for her actions because Nic
wasn't in control and was genuinely sorry.  She understood why Sam
had forgiven Nicole but a day didn't go by that she didn't curse the
short blonde.  And the same time, a day didn't pass without her being
in awe of her daughter and the strength it must have took for Sam to
have been the one to extend the olive branch to Nicole.  &lt;Sometimes
that girl amazes me&gt; Jane thought.  Nicole shifted nervously on her
feet.</p>

<p>"Uhm, Sam let me in.  She wants to show you something in the
living room," she said quietly.  Nicole was very scared to be in the
house full of the family she had nearly destroyed with her foolish
actions but Sam had been insistant and for the life of her, Nic
couldn't refuse.  So here she stood, looking at her former friend who
stared at her with contempt and anger, both of which she knew she
deserved.</p>

<p>"How did you get here?" Mike asked, knowing Nicole didn't
have a driver's license anymore.  This won him a wry smile from the
former ice queen.</p>

<p>"Cab.  Sam called me to pick her up at rehab and bring her
here.  She didn't really say why she wanted me here but, I couldn't
say no." Brooke broke away from her father and walked towards Nicole.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Nicole.  Let's go see what her surprise is," she
managed to say in a somewhat civil tone.  She knew Sam wanted
everyone to forgive Nicole, or at least not hate the girl but Brooke
couldn't chase the images from that night from her mind.  She walked
passed Nicole into the living room and nearly fainted.  There in the
living room was Sam holding a giant teddy bear with a huge red bow in
her arms.  And she was standing.</p>

<p>"Oh my God, Sam!" Jane gasped from the doorway when she
entered the room behind Brooke.  Mike grabbed her to steady the
swaying woman.  Sam smirked.</p>

<p>"Gee, you all look like you've never seen me stand before,"
she said calmly.  She turned to Brooke.  "Do you like your bithday
present?" Brooke grinned knowing that Sam didn't mean the teddy
bear.  She was almost afraid to move; that this was a dream and when
she woke Sam would still be in that chair.  She didn't even realize
she was crying until Sam frowned.</p>

<p>"Aw, don't cry.  You're supposed to be happy, silly," Sam
admonished her as she set the bear down.  Still moving rather
stiffly, Sam took a tentative step towards Brooke, testing the
strength of her legs.  After assuring herself that they were indeed
going to hold her, she took another and closed the short distance
between them.  Everyone watched in silence as Sam reached Brooke and
wiped away the tears with a lopsided grin on her face.  Finally,
Brooke spoke.</p>

<p>"How, Sammy?  When?"</p>

<p>"I've been working on it, when you haven't been with me at
rehab, as a surprise.  We all knew I'd walk again, it was just a
matter of when," Sam told her.  Brooke enveloped her in a tight hug
and was quickly joined by Jane and Mike.  Nicole stood a few feet
away watching awkwardly.</p>

<p>"I know that doctors said you would Sam but this is amazing,"
Mike said in awe.  Sam just beamed at him.</p>

<p>"I wanted to be able to do this by Brooke's birthday.  Don't
go throwing a big bruhah just yet.  I'm not up to any marathons or
anything.  Standing and a couple of steps are the extent of my
abilities right now.  We'll save the 26k run until next week."

"Oh, Sam this is fantastic," Jane cried, tears flowing down her
cheeks. Sam sighed.</p>

<p>"You're supposed to be happy, Mom.  Why is everyone crying?" she sked
with a laugh.  Even Nicole (yes, Nicole) and Mike had tears in their
eyes.  "You all keep this up and we'll have to rent an ark."</p>

<p>"This is just amazing and the best birthday gift I could have gotten,
Sam.  Thank you," Brooke whispered seriously.  Sam nodded.</p>

<p>"I aim to please.  Hey, Nic?" Nicole looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yeah?" Sam smiled at her.  It still shocked Nicole that of all
people, Sam McPherson forgave her for what she'd done.  She was the
one that had nearly killed Sam, had taken away her voice for a while
and put her in that infernal chair and yet, Sam forgave her and asked
the gang to give the poor girl a break.  No one had spoken to or
given the time of day to Nicole since the accident and Nicole knew
the only reason she wasn't up the creek sans paddle was Sam McPherson.</p>

<p>"Can you bring my chair over?  I don't wanna overdo it," Sam asked
politely.  Nicole nodded and wheeled the chair over and helped Brooke
get Sam into it.  Brooke looked at Nicole and Nic saw some of the
animosity drain away.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Nic.  I bet you're all wondering why I called her, huh?" Sam
asked.  Four pairs of eyes stared at her and waited.  "OK, look, I
wanted to be able to stand on my own and walk a little by Brooke's
birthday because I thought it would be a really cool present and I'm
a little low on cash.  But I invited Nicole here for another reason.
I've asked everyone to if not forgive her at least not to hate her
for what she did.  And to some extent everyone has tried but the
scars, both physical and mental remain.  But everyone only considers
our wounds.  My wounds and Brooke's.  What this family went through,
what our friends went through.  I'm not sure anyone has given any
real thought to Nicole's wounds."</p>

<p>*** AUTHORS NOTE: corndog alert***</p>

<p>"I believe her when she says she's sorry.  No one, not even Nicole
Julian, could fake the look on her face when she says it.  She is
truly sorry.  And her sentence for what she did, the rehab she went
through was part of her healing process, same as my rehab is for me.
We see how she is now, after therapy and I don't think there's one of
us who could say she's the same person she once was.  But for all the
therapy and community service, I think you needed to see me stand and
walk as much as my family did, Nic.  I invited you here to share this
to help you heal." Tears flowed freely down Nicole's face as she
listened to Sam's heartfelt words and she realized that Sam really
didn't hate her for what she did.</p>

<p>"Th…thank you, Sam," she stuttered as sobs of relief, pent up since
the moment she confessed to Officer Bennett threatened to make
themselves present.  Sam held her arms open.</p>

<p>"It's OK to cry, Nicole.  You were hurt too but now we can all start
to heal.  I will walk again and all of us will have our lives back."
Nicole collapsed into Sam's waiting arms, not caring that she had an
audience and cried.  Mike turned to Brooke and Jane.</p>

<p>"That is one amazing young lady," he whispered quietly, for their
ears only.  They nodded in agreement.  "And I never thought I'd see
the day when I'd think of Nicole as human."  Again they nodded.</p>
