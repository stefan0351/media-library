<!-- The Waiting Game Or Why Are Waiting Room Magazines Six Months Old? -->

<p>The ride to the hospital felt like it took a lifetime when in reality
only a few minutes passed.  Brooke stood to the side out of the way
as Sam was wheeled into the Emergency Room and suddenly swarmed by
awaiting doctors.  She hated letting go of Sam's hand feeling somehow
like by letting go she would lose her forever.  She shifted from foot
to foot and tried to get a look at what was going on around Sam but
there was too much she didn't understand.  As she stood there a
little while later feeling lost and alone, she saw Mike and Jane come
running through the Emergency Room doors towards her.</p>

<p>"Brooke!  Good Lord, what's going on?  Where's Sam?" Jane asked in a
panicked rush.  Mike put his hands on her shoulders to calm her.
They could both see how shaken up Brooke was by the paleness of her
features and the condition of her clothing.  Her dress was ripped and
stained in blood that was obviously not her own.</p>

<p>"Brooke, Harrison just came by the house and told us that you and Sam
had been involved in an accident and to meet you here.  What's going
on?" Brooke looked at her father for a few minutes, trying to find
the words to explain the horror of the nights events thus far.  But
she found that she was unable to speak.  She opened and closed her
mouth a few times before just shrugging and sitting down in a nearby
chair and burying her head in her hands, her composure finally
breaking down.  Mike and Jane sat down next to her and let her cry
for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"You're in shock, honey, it's OK.  Harrison said something about
Nicole trying to run you over and Sam getting hit instead.  Is that
true?  Just nod or something if you can't speak," Mike said gently.
Brooke nodded her head, not raising it from where it was hidden in
her hands.  She kept praying that this was a nightmare and someone
was going to wake her up soon.  She kept hoping Sam was going to walk
into her room at any moment and jump on her bed and yell at her to
wake up before she was late for school, anything but what was really
happening.</p>

<p>"OK, God, I knew I should have bodily stopped Nicole when she came to
the house tonight," Mike sighed painfully.  Brooke looked up in
confusion.  "She came over to the house, obviously drunk and I
thought I hid her keys from her while I called her mother.  When I
got back, she was gone.  Oh, honey, I never thought..." Mike stopped
unable to continue the thought.  </p>

<p>"What about Sam, Brooke?  Where is she?" Jane asked anxiously.
Brooke looked at her fearfully, her stomach churning as she told Jane
Sam's condition.</p>

<p>"She was hurt really bad, Mom," Brooke said quietly, finally able to
speak again.  She watched the remaining color drain from Jane's
face.  "They took her into surgery right before you got here.  They
said they couldn't wait for consent so I let them take her.  Oh, God,
I'm so sorry, Jane, it should have been me!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Jane asked between tears as she hugged the upset
teen.</p>

<p>"Nicole was aiming for me and I froze when I saw the car.  Sam didn't
and pushed me out of the way, but she couldn't get herself out of the
way in time.  So Nicole hit her instead and if I hadn't gotten upset
and run off like that in the first place it wouldn't have happened.
And I never meant for it to happen and now everything's ruined and
Sam might die and..." Brooke rambled on as the doors opened again and
Harrison arrived with Lily, Josh, and Carmen in tow. </p>

<p>"What's going on?  Is what Harrison said true, Brooke?  Did Nic try
to kill you?" Josh asked.  Brooke, spent from her little rant and at
the end of her emotional reserves could only nod in response.</p>

<p>"I'm going to find a doctor and see if I can find out about Sam's
condition," Mike said as he got up and hugged Jane and Brooke.  "And
this isn't your fault, Brooke.  It's Nicole's.  Don't blame
yourself." Again, Brooke only nodded.</p>

<p>"He's right," Jane said with a hug, "No one is going to blame you,
Brooke.  I don't and neither will Sam.  So don't blame yourself."</p>

<p>"And don't worry about Sam, either.  She's a tough cookie," Carmen
pipped up, desperate to be helpful.  "I'm sure she'll bounce right
back in no time."  Brooke shook her head sadly, a pitiful sob
escaping her throat before she could stop it.  She took a deep breath
before trying to speak again.</p>

<p>"You didn't...you didn't see her, Carmen," Brooke said in a voice
barely audible over the quiet din of the waiting room.  "There was so
much blood.  Sam's blood.  Oh, God," Brooke buried her head in her
hands again and cried in earnest while curling herself into a ball in
the chair.  Her entire body shook with the force of her sobs.  Jane
rubbed her back as she too cried. No one knew what to say so silence
stretched across the room until Mike returned a few minutes later
with a solemn look on his face.</p>

<p>"She's in surgery now, Jane.  It...it doesn't look good," he said
sadly.  Jane started crying harder and was joined by Carmen and
Lily.  "She was hit pretty hard according to the doctors.  I hope you
don't mind but I signed the papers for them to do what they have to."
Jane nodded.</p>

<p>"OK," she sobbed.  "I can't lose her.  She's all I have of left of
Joe.  She's my first baby," she continued to cry.  Mike enveloped her
in a comforting hug.</p>

<p>"I know, I know, dear.  But you have to believe that Sam will pull
through this.  We all have to," he looked into the grief stricken
faces of the teens around him.  "You all mean so much to Sam, and I
can't thank you enough for being here for us right now."</p>

<p>"She means a lot to us, Mr. McQueen.  There's no where else we'd
rather be than here for Sam and you three," Carmen said as she
regained some composure.</p>

<p>"Yeah, she's more than our friend, Mr. McQueen.  You don't know us
very well because you're Brooke's dad but Sam is our glue, the one
that holds us together and without her we'd be lost," Lily explained
as Josh held her.  Jane smiled despite her tears.</p>

<p>"That's very sweet, Lily.  I'm sure Sam would love to hear that,"
Jane said.  Brooke nodded.</p>

<p>"It's true, Dad, I've seen it.  The friendships these guys have with
Sam are like nothing I have with any of my friends.  It's really
special."</p>

<p>"You're our friend too, Brooke," Harrison pointed out quietly.  Lily
and Carmen nodded.</p>

<p>"You bet, Brooke.  See?  Part of that is because you and Sam let that
silly feud between you die, or least die down," Carmen laughed.</p>

<p>"Thanks you guys, that means a lot," Brooke smiled genuinely for the
first time since being caught in Nicole's headlights earlier.</p>

<p>"I'm really glad that both our daughters have such kind and caring
friends who are there for them when it really counts," Mike said
gently, making all the teens blush slightly at the compliment.  That
being said, no one else had anything else to say so they all sat back
and waited for word on Sam's condition and prayed.</p>
