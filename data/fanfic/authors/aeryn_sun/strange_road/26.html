<!-- Party Favors Or Nicole Is Not A Human Pinata -->


<p>"What is she doing here?" Harrison growled.  Sam bit back a laugh
that threatened to escape her as Harrison stepped in front of her
wheelchair as if to protect her.  Although it did give her a good
view of his butt, she would just rather it was Brooke's.</p>

<p>"I invited her," Brooke's voice informed him and the rest of the
partygoers from the doorway.  Her tone let everyone know that there
would be no further argument about it.  Nicole looked back at Sam as
if to ask if she was sure she wanted to go through this.  Sam smiled
and shrugged.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it, Nic, you wouldn't be here if the birthday girl
didn't want you to be," she said rather pointedly, also letting the
group know she was in on the decision to let Nicole stay.  Mike and
Jane entered the room at that point and asked for everyone's
attention.</p>

<p>"OK, Nicole is here because Sam brought her over to the house earlier
and Brooke invited her to stay for the party.  We all realize that
this might cause some awkwardness among you, all we ask is that you
let it go for this one night.  If we can welcome Nicole into our home
after what happened, I think you can accept her for this one night
and treat her with the same respect as she has shown us since coming
through that door."  He was answered with nods and a few OK's but no
one was overly enthusiastic, not that they expected them to be.  The
mood seemed to settle for a second before Sam spoke up.</p>

<p>"Who wants to go pop wheelie's in the driveway with me?"
**</p>

<p>"Oh, Harrison, it's beautiful," Brooke gushed as she unwrapped the
gold heart shaped locket, about the size of a quarter.  The rest of
the group started to catcall and make fun of him. Harrison blushed.</p>

<p>"Don't get ahead of me, guys.  Open it Brooke," He asked while trying
not to turn ten shades of red.  He knew he lost his chances both with
Brooke and Sam, where he didn't know but he was just happy they were
both alive.  He still had nightmare of that night.  Brooke opened the
locket to find a picture of herself, Harrison and Sam.  She looked at
Harrison in surprise.</p>

<p>"After what happened," he shot a not so surreptitious glare at Nicole
who pretended not to notice. "I realized that we almost threw away a
lot more than we realized.  Our friendships should mean more than who
wants who and whatever.  And then we almost lost Sam.  I realized
that you guys are two of the best friends I've ever had and I wanted
you to know that.  I thought that this way you could have a reminder
that I hold both of you in a special place in my heart.  And you can
have the all of us close to yours." He sat down embarrassed by his
heartfelt confession and the strange looks he was getting.  Brooke
was crying, actually, everyone was crying.</p>

<p>"Harrison, that's so sweet," Sam whispered in awe.  Brooke walked
over to Harrison and kissed him softly on the cheek.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Harrison, that means so much," she told him.  He blushed
several shades deeper.</p>

<p>"Joe, Ah awl-ways knew you was an ole saw-fty at heart!" Mary Cherry
exclaimed as she grabbed the suddenly frightened young man in an
impressive bear hug.  "An' such a romantic!"</p>

<p>"Mary Cherry, let Harrison go, he needs oxygen," Carmen instructed
from a few seats away as everyone laughed.  "My turn, Brooke."
Brooke picked up the box from Carmen and gave it a light shake.  "No
cheating, Brooke.  Open."  Brooke peeled away the wrapping.  Inside
was a copy of the shooting script from the movie `Shakespeare in
Love', signed by Gwynth herself.  Brooke stared at it in awe.</p>

<p>"Carmen, how?" she stammered as she continued to stare at it.  Carmen
smiled rather smugly.</p>

<p>"Ebay.  I found a copy of it on Ebay and bid on it.  I thought it
would be perfect.  Not as touching as Harrison's but pretty darn cool
in it's own right."  Everyone agreed.</p>

<p>"Wow, Carmen, thanks!" Brooke gave Carmen a huge hug.  Lily and Josh
handed Brooke the next box. </p>

<p>"We don't have a lot of money but we managed to get you this," Lily
explained as Brooke pulled out a black soft leather jacket from
inside the box.</p>

<p>"Lily told me you saw it one of the times she got you to leave Sam's
side at the hospital," Josh told her.  "She said it was one of the
first things that seemed to make you smile since the accident, you
said it was beautiful.  We thought you'd like it."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't have.  It was expensive," Josh waved her off.  </p>

<p>"Don't worry about it.  We're both working, it's no big deal we just
hope you like it," he said.  Brooke hugged them both.</p>

<p>"Besides, after everything, Josh's Mom decided to help us out a
little bit, not too much.  The jacket is from her as much as us."</p>

<p>"I love it, thank you both so much.  Say `thank you' to her for me."</p>

<p>"Brookie?" Mary Cherry stepped forward, all excited about her gift.
This was the best way she had to cement her new status as Brooke's
new `Best Friend for Life'. </p>

<p>"Yes, Mary Cherry?" Brooke was almost afraid to ask.  She knew, she
just knew Mary Cherry had done something outrageous and wasn't sure
if she was up to handling it.  Mary Cherry held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Here," she said simply.  Brooke frowned and took Mary Cherry's
hand.  When she opened her hand, there was a set of keys in it.</p>

<p>"Mary Cherry, what?" Mary Cherry beamed.</p>

<p>"Now, sugah, Ah know Ah ain't awl-ways the brightest bulb in the
bunch, but Ah know how hard this musta bin on y'all, wit' Sammy bein'
in th' `chair an' all.  So, this ve-hick-al is fully e-quiped wit'
the latest, state-o'-th'-art facilities for th' physically impaired,
m'okay?" Brooke shook her head.</p>

<p>"Huh?" </p>

<p>"What she's trying to say is," Sugar Daddy broke in.  "That the keys
go to a handicap accessible van that belongs to you as long as Sam
needs it." When everyone turned to look at him he shrugged.  "She
asked me for help getting the `perfect gift'.  I knew that getting
Sam back and forth to school and rehab was tough, yo, so I thought
that a van that was yours would be really cool."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Sugar," Sam spoke up.  "You too, Mary Cherry."</p>

<p>"Yes, that was very thoughtful of you, Mary Cherry," Brooke told
her.  Mary Cherry's eyes lit up like Christmas tree lights.</p>

<p>"An' that's not th' best part, y'all.  When Lil' Sammy's walkin'
under her own steam, y'all cin trade in the van fer whatever ya
like!  Cuz Ah know nuthin's gunna stop Sammy from walkin' agin'."
Mary Cherry said with conviction.</p>

<p>"Here here!" Mike said as everyone joined in.  Nicole walked over to
both Brooke and Sam and handed a small box to Brooke.</p>

<p>"It seems silly, I owe the two of you more than I can ever repay and
not just because of what I did.  I can never fix that, I know that.
I can't change what I did.  If there was any way I could, trust me I
would.  But, besides that, Brooke you were always the only real
friend I ever had and I betrayed you in the worst way.  Not just with
my actions that night but with almost everything I ever did.  I'm not
going to stand here and say I'm a new woman because we all know it's
a lie.  But I am a better one, thanks to you.  I can never have your
friendship back but," Nicole lost her train of thought and simply
gave up with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Sam, you gave me part of my soul back and I thought I lost that
entirely long ago.  Thanks."  Brooke listened in stunned silence and
when she was done opened the box.  It was empty.  Nicole looked at
her.</p>

<p>"Don't freak out that I've had a relapse or something, OK.  It's
supposed to be symbolic of the fact that no gift would ever be enough
to show you what you mean to me as a friend.  So instead of buying
you a gift, I did something else.  Two somethings, actually."</p>

<p>"OK, Nic, spill," Sam said, her curiousity killing her.  Nicole
flashed a rare, genuine smile.</p>

<p>"I dipped into the trust fund that Nana left me and used it for
something important.  Not that Prada and Gucci aren't important but
anyway, Brooke, for you, I made a donation in your name to the Eating
Disorder Clinic.  It's a replenishing donation so on your birthday
every year, the donation will be made again.  That place will never
go out of business unless there is no one left to help."</p>

<p>"The other gift is for Sam.  It's a grant for any Kennedy High School
Senior graduating and pursuing an education in journalism.  It's
called the Sam McPherson Merit award and goes towards deferring the
rising costs of higher education.  And if you are still interested
when we graduate, I think you'll be the first one to qualify, Sam."</p>

<p>"At least it's not the Sam McPherson Memorial Grant," Sam laughed.
Brooke smacked her lightly upside the head.</p>

<p>"Ew, Sam, not funny," Brooke complained.  Sam mumbled something about
it being wrong to smack a former coma patient upside the head but
everyone wisely ignored her.  Brooke looked at Nicole as if seeing
her for the first time.  She still looked the same and Brooke had no
doubt that the claws were still there but, like Nicole said, finally
there was a hint of a soul behind the brilliant blue eyes that looked
back at her.  Brooke was absolutely stunned by the thoughtfulness
behind the gifts.  It was so unlike the Nicole she once knew.  Of
course, Brooke never thought the Nicole she knew would try to run her
over with her Jaguar either.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Nicole, I really don't know what to say," Brooke told her
honestly.</p>

<p>"Thanks is more than enough.  Letting me stay for the party was more
than I could have hoped for."</p>

<p>"Wow, Nicole, this new you is kinda nice," Carmen said from her side
of the table.  Nicole shrugged.</p>

<p>"Yeah?  Don't get used to it.  Like I said, I'm not a new person, I'm
still the Queen Bitch, I've just temporarily been declawed.  I'm sure
I'll recover by the time school starts.  Any of you breathe a word of
this and I'll skin you alive," she warned although there was a hint
of mirth behind the formally callous blue eyes.</p>

<p>"There's the Nic we all know and loathe," Sam pointed out with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Got that right, Spam," Nicole told her.</p>

<p>"I know, Satan," Sam countered for good measure although the exchange
lacked most of the venom usually associated with their exchanges.</p>

<p>"Just getting warmed up," Nicole explained to the confused faces in
the room.  Sam burst out laughing which signaled to everyone else
that she and Nic were indeed joking around.  Although no one really
had any doubts that once school got into full swing that things would
revert to the way they once were. </p>

<p>"I need a soda," Sam announced as she stood up from her chair and
walked the very short distance to the fridge.  The room was filled
with several gasps of surprise and one near faint (Carmen) when she
did so.  After shutting the refridgerator door, Sam turned to face
her stunned friends.  </p>

<p>"What?" she asked, shrugging theatrically.</p>
