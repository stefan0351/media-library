<!-- Elmer Fudd Plays Charades -->

<p>"G...g.... Go...'way..." Sam stuttered a week later as she pulled the covers
up over her head with her good arm.  The last thing she wanted right
now was to face anyone, but especially Brooke whom she knew to be on
the other side of the door.  She was grateful that she was stuttering
less thanks to practice and her speech therapist but still hated
talking to anyone.  </p>

<p>Sam always prided herself on her independence and her ability to
function through almost anything with as little help as possible.
Even when her father had died, Sam did everything she could to show
everyone how strong she was, even when she wasn't.  Being reduced to
a wheelchair was bad enough but on its own she could probably handle
it.  But for someone as verbose and loquacious as Sam, being barely
able to speak coherently or write was like a slow torturous death.
Even typing on the laptop Brooke had brought her wasn't enough.  She
didn't want to see anyone and didn't want anyone to see her in this
state.  When she was in a coma it was different; at least she was
unconscious.  But now that she was awake and cognizant, she hated
that they would see her as weak.  And she really didn't want Brooke
to see her that way.</p>

<p>"Come on, Sam, let me in," Brooke called from behind the door.  Sam
sighed.  &lt;Damn persistant little twit&gt; Sam swore to herself.  Not
that she really thought of Brooke as a twit, at least not anymore.
She just wasn't up to facing the persistantly effervescent
cheerleader right now.  </p>

<p>Usually seeing Brooke was the highlight of Sam's day, which, given
the fact that they shared a house meant that Sam's days were filled
with highlights.  But since the accident, Sam was filled with the
irrational fear that having Brooke see her in her current state would
somehow make the blonde view her through a veil of pity.  And that
alone was enough to make Sam wish the car was going a little faster
when it hit her.  She wanted no one's pity, especially Brooke's.</p>

<p>Her mother and Mike, as well as the hospital staff had told both Sam
about Brooke's vigilance by her bedside during her coma but she
didn't know what to make of it.  &lt;Probably just feels guilty&gt; she
reasoned.  &lt;Doing what she felt she had too.  She has absolutely
nothing to feel guilty about, though.  God I hope she knows that&gt;
Somehow Sam had known Brooke was there, felt her beside her the
entire time even if she couldn't let anyone know.  Technically she
wasn't aware of anything going on around her, but somehow, and even
Sam didn't know how herself, somehow she knew Brooke was right there
the entire time trying to bring her out of the coma.  And it was
oddly comforting.  No, wait, not oddly, it was very comforting.
There was no one else Sam would rather have by her side when she was
sick or hurt than Brooke McQueen.  Present case excluded, of course.</p>

<p>"N...no," Sam protested from beneath her covers, knowing however that
it was in vain.  Brooke opened the door and walked in.</p>

<p>"Tough.  You've refused to see anyone else except Mom and Dad and
even they say that you don't exactly `visit' with them.  So come on
Sam, talk to me.  What's wrong?" Sam moved the blankets so that she
could glare at Brooke for her choice of words.  Brooke
shrugged.  "Don't glare at me like the I'm the Anti-Christ, Sam.  The
doctors said the more you spoke the easier it would get so, talk.
And no using the laptop anymore," she said, undisturbed by the
continued stare.  The silence stretched between them for several
tense minutes.  </p>

<p>"Sam," Brooke softly started a few minutes later.  She hated watching
what Sam was doing to herself and to those who cared for her.  But on
some level, Brooke understood it.  Sam was seeking to control
something when everything else had been taken out of her control.  If
that meant shutting everyone else out and becoming a mental recluse,
so be it.  But Brooke wasn't going to let her get away with it.  </p>

<p>"This has gone on long enough.  The doctors are willing to let you
come home in a few days because physically you're doing really well.
But they might not let you because of this behavior.  You're shutting
everyone out and withdrawing from everything and we're all really
worried about you." She looked at Sam hoping for some sort of
reaction but saw only the now familiar blank stare.  Swallowing a
sigh of despair, she continued.</p>

<p>"It's not healthy, Sam.  Shutting everyone out is only going to cause
you more pain.  You can't do this alone," she reached out to brush a
stray lock of hair away from Sam's face only to have the other girl
flinch and pull away.  Brooke pulled her hand away and placed it, now
in a fist, by her side.  She wasn't mad she was hurt.  &lt;How can Sam
think I'd hurt her?  I love her.  Huh?  Did I just think that?  Uh-oh...
&gt;</p>

<p>Sam meanwhile, was trying to figure out why she pulled away.  &lt;I
can't let her get close, I just can't.  She pities me, I just know
it.  I don't want her pity, I want more than that and I can't have
any more than that and it's going to kill me&gt; She pulled away further
trying not to cry in loneliness and despair.</p>

<p>"Uhm...Sam, please," Brooke implored the rapidly receding girl.
Watching Sam shrink into herself was strange given the fact that Sam
was usually so outgoing and in-your-face.  Before the accident,
Brooke had the chance on occasion to see beyond the walls and
barriers Sam had constructed around herself to keep from being hurt
but now they were back, stronger than ever and it disturbed Brooke.
Sam was obviously in a lot of pain, not just the physical sort and
all Brooke wanted to do was help but she didn't know how.  And Sam
sure wasn't making it any easier.</p>

<p>"P...Pl...please what?" Sam asked somewhat angrily, startling Brooke
first by speaking and then by sounding so mad.   Brooke frowned.</p>

<p>"Please don't shut me out.  Let me help you," Sam let out a short
bark that Brooke assumed she was supposed to think was a laugh.  It
was more frightening than anything else was.</p>

<p>"He...help me?  Don't ma...make me l...laugh," Sam shot out bitterly. &lt;When
all else fails, get angry.  I'm very good at angry&gt; Sam told herself,
instantly hating herself for the hurt look on Brooke's face.</p>

<p>Brooke fought back the tears that immediately sprang forth at the
tone of Sam's voice.  Silence stretched between them again before
Brooke could find her voice again and ask the question that she
dreaded the answer to.  She had been putting it off until Sam was
able to speak better but knew she couldn't wait any longer, she had
to know the answer now.</p>

<p>"Do you...do you blame me for what happened?" she asked very
quietly. "Is that why you're so mad at me?" She hung her head low
letting her blonde hair cover her face so Sam wouldn't see the tears
that now fell freely down her face.  She had wondered about it since
that night.  &lt;Will Sam blame me for this?  If I hadn't run out of
there like a wounded animal it never would have happened.  If I had
been honest in the first place and told her that I wasn't competing
with her for Harrison, I was fighting Harrison for her, this might
never have happened.  Now she hates me&gt;</p>

<p>As Brooke fought her inner battle, Sam sat shocked at the question.
&lt;What the Hell?  How could she?  Why would she?  I would never...I love
her...uh-oh...&gt;</p>

<p>"Jesus!" Sam exclaimed making Brooke snap her head up in surprise.
Sam saw the tear tracks on the blonde's beautiful face and if she'd
been physically capable, would have gotten up out of her bed and
kicked her own butt for making Brooke cry.</p>

<p>"Sam?" Brooke asked quietly, confused by the outburst.  Sam shook her
head regretfully.  She had to make Brooke understand that the blame
lay elsewhere.</p>

<p>"D...don't...blame...you..." Sam bit off each word as she struggled not to
stutter.  Brooke just sighed and shook her head resigned.</p>

<p>"I understand if you do, Sam," Brooke told her sadly.  "If I hadn't
run off like that, you wouldn't have followed and..." Sam put her good
hand under Brooke's chin and tilted the cheerleader's face up to meet
hers.</p>

<p>"Don't," Sam said simply, hoping Brooke understood.  She really hated
not being able to talk correctly.  "My...ch...ch...choice," she finally
ground out frustrated beyond belief and nearly to tears.  Brooke
looked in Sam's brown eyes and saw no blame or condemnation in them,
only love and pain.  Even so, Brooke couldn't help but blame herself.</p>

<p>"But it's my fault, Sammy," she said as she got up off the bed and
started to pace.  Unseen by Brooke, Sam arched an eyebrow at the use
of the name `Sammy'.  If she'd been capable of coherent sentences or
at least ones that didn't take three years to say she would have had
a witty comment but she kept it to herself and filed it away for
future reference.</p>

<p>"I played that stupid game with you and Harrison and when I didn't
get what I wanted I ran off like a two year old throwing a tantrum.
You could have been killed, Sam!  Do you know what it's like to live
with that?"</p>

<p>"Yeah," Sam interjected but Brooke ignored her and continued.</p>

<p>"And now because I acted like a child you nearly died and now you
can't speak, and you're stuck in a wheelchair for who knows how long
and it's all my fault!"  Sam watched Brooke pace and rave for a few
minutes until she had enough and picked up a pillow and heaved it
with as much strength as she could muster at the head cheerleader.
Brooke stopped in her tracks and looked at Sam.</p>

<p>"What?" she asked confused.  Sam smiled and waved her back over to
the bed.  After Brooke sat back down on the edge of the bed, Sam held
up one finger.</p>

<p>"One," Sam started trying real hard to speak clearly.  Truthfully,
she'd been practicing, talking to herself in her room (when no one
was around, of course.  Wouldn't want anyone to think there was
permanent brain damage) but she didn't want to test it out until she
was more sure of herself.  But Brooke forced her hand.</p>

<p>"One, I d...don't bl...blame you," she started as Brooke listened
intently.  It was the most alive Sam had been since the accident.
Sam held up two fingers.</p>

<p>"T...Two, n...not y...y...your fau...fault, Ni...Nicole's" she sighed at herself
and her stuttering.  Brooke reached out again to push that stubborn
lock of hair out of Sam's face and was about to stop with the memory
of the last time fresh in her mind, when she caught the glimmer in
Sam's eyes that told her that it was all right.  She pushed back the
hair and was aware that her hand probably lingered too long on Sam's
cheek but Sam didn't seem to mind. Sam now held up three fingers.</p>

<p>"Three?" Brooke asked, starting to laugh.  "Maybe we should try
Charades?" Sam swatted her playfully on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"D...don't help," she warned.  She held up the three fingers
again.  "Three," she said clearly and took a deep breath, determined
not to stutter her way through this one sentence.  Brooke needed to
hear her say it, even if it was a given.  So Sam focused all her
concentration on the next three little words.</p>

<p>"I forgive you," she said slowly but clearly.  Brooke burst into
tears at the short sentence.</p>

<p>"Thank you Sammy, thank you so much.  You have no idea what it means
to me to hear you say that." Sam just held on to the crying girl and
eventually joined in with her own tears.  After a while, Brooke
disconnected herself from Sam's grasp and sat back on the bed and
studied the injured girl in front of her.  There was still so much
she had to say, so she might as well say it while Sam was unable to
interrupt.  &lt;Cheap I know, so sue me.&gt;</p>

<p>"Sam, we still need to talk," she started and watched as Sam rolled
her eyes with a groan and leaned back into her remaining pillow.
Brooke retrieved the other pillow and placed it under Sam's head
before continuing.</p>

<p>"Seriously, even if you have nothing to say, I do.  I'm glad, really
glad, that you don't blame me for the accident.  And I believe that
you don't.  It's a huge weight off my chest knowing that.  But I
meant what I said when I first got here.  You can't keep doing this.
You can't shut everyone out and go through this by yourself.  Not
even you, the great, strong, invincible Samantha McPherson, can
handle this without help."</p>

<p>"But you won't let anyone help you, you keep pushing everyone away.
You won't let anyone visit, just Mom, Dad, and me. The gang is really
hurt that you've shut them out.  They know that you're going to be in
a wheelchair for a while, Sam and they don't think any less of you.
They don't think you're weak because you won't be walking out of here
on your own just yet," Sam shot her a dirty look letting Brooke know
she hit a nerve.  "I know that's one of the things you're afraid of,
being seen as weak, but that isn't how we see you.  God, Sam, do you
have any idea how wrong you are?"</p>

<p>"You pushed me out of the way of a speeding car and were nearly
killed for your trouble.  That makes you strong and brave, not weak!
So you're stuck in a chair, maybe permanetly, maybe not.  Who cares?
That doesn't make you any less a person, any less Sam McPherson than
you were the morning before the accident.  You're still the same
smart, witty, beautiful young woman who I'm proud to share a family
with."  Unable to continue listening to Brooke extolling the virtues
of her character, Sam interrupted.</p>

<p>"Y...you think...I'm...be...beau..." Sam tried before giving up with a
frustrated growl.  Brooke blushed when she realized that she'd let
that bit of information slip.  &lt;No backing out of it now, I suppose&gt;</p>

<p>"Beautiful, and yes, I do.  Don't you?" Brooke asked like it was the
most natural thing in the world.  Sam thought about it for a second
before shrugging.</p>

<p>"N...not real..ly," she never gave it a lot of thought, actually.  Sure
she knew she was attractive, cute, she guessed.  But Brooke was the
beautiful one.  Tall, blonde, fair skinned, hazel eyes, like a model
straight out of Vogue magazine.  Sam on the other hand was the exact
opposite.  Not short but not that tall either, dark hair and eyes,
light skin, nothing spectacular.  Maybe good enough to model for the
Sears catalogue, in her opinion.  The fact that Brooke thought that
she was beautiful made her feel unbelievably good.</p>

<p>Sam had realized in the past few months that her feelings for Brooke
were changing somewhat.  Into what she didn't know but she knew they
were definitely heading away from the aggressive I-hate-you sort they
started as and then became the OK-you're-my-step-sister-I-can-deal-
with-you sort into the I-get-all-mushy-inside-when-you're-around
type.  She'd never really entertained the idea that she wasn't
heterosexual but the more time she found herself spending thinking
and fantasizing about the blonde, the more she realized that maybe
she wasn't.  And then she discovered that she really didn't care.
She was never one for conformity anyway.</p>

<p>It was really out of fear that she hadn't said anything yet.  She had
no idea how her soon-to-be-blended family would react to the `Hi
everyone I'm gay!' announcement at the dinner table.  That might not
be so bad, actually.  Her mother was usually pretty understanding
about most things even if this would be a shock.  Brooke would
probably choke on her diet Pepsi but recover and given the fact that
she wasn't the evil person Sam once thought she was she probably
wouldn't blab it all over school.  And Mike was a pretty nice guy, so
it'd most likely be all right.  But following it up with `Oh and by
the way, I seriously have the hots for my stepsister so bad I can't
think about anything else.  Could you please pass the salt?' would
undoubtedly make things very uncomfortable in the McPherson-McQueen
household.  Brooke and her mother would probably faint over dead and
Mike would probably murder her.  </p>

<p>But still, the accident had kind of changed her stance on staying
quiet much longer.  If her life or Brooke's could end in one split
second like it almost had, how could she stay locked in her self-
imposed box simply because she was afraid?  Fear was not a concept
Sam was familiar with or let control her life.  And now that she knew
Brooke thought she was beautiful, at least in an asthetically-
pleasing sort of way, maybe it would work out all right even if
Brooke were straight, which she really had no reason to doubt.
Brooke might even find her crush flattering, if she wasn't totally
freaked out.</p>

<p>"Not really?  Not really?" Brooke repeated, acting horribly
aghast.  "Sam, you have perfect hair, perfect skin, beautiful deep
eyes and those lips..." Brooke's voice trailed off as she realized that
she'd probaby said waaayyyy too much.  The way Sam was looking at her
was kind of reaffirming her belief that she had.  Sam resembled a
deer caught in the headlights.  &lt;Bad pun, Brooke, been there, done
that.  Bad imagery.  Bad memories&gt; OK, Sam looked like she just stuck
her finger in a light socket, minus the spikey hair.  &lt;Yeah, that's
better&gt;</p>

<p>Sam for her part couldn't believe what she'd just heard.  &lt;Perfect
hair?  Perfect skin?  Beautiful eyes?  And what about my lips?  I am
getting soooo confused here.  Brooke is straight, right?  That didn't
change while I was in a coma, did it?  She didn't hit her head on the
asphalt when I tackled her, did she?&gt;  Shock was settling in on Sam's
system again.</p>

<p>"Wh...what ab..bout my l...lips?" Sam teased, enjoying the interesting
shade of crimson that Brooke suddenly turned.</p>

<p>&lt;Sinful springs to mind&gt; Brooke thought immediately but didn't dare
say it outloud for fear of sending Sam straight back into her coma
out of sheer shock.  Although Sam seemed to be enjoying the turn the
conversation was taking. </p>

<p>"They're nice and full and I know lots of girls who would pay lots of
money to have lips like yours," Brooke told her casually, taking the
safe way out.  "Actually, I know some who already have.  And I know
there must be a lot of guys out there who would love to kiss them."
&lt;Not to mention me&gt; she added silently. The former statement about
the guys made Sam start to laugh until the action reminded her of her
condition painfully.  Brooke was beside her in an instant worried.</p>

<p>"Are you all right?  Do you need a doctor?" Sam shook her head while
holding her ribcage gingerly and waited for the pain to pass.  She
gave Brooke what she hoped was a reassuring smile.</p>

<p>"Laughing...bad..." she explained.  Brooke was instantly contrite.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry, Sammy.  I didn't mean to," Sam held up her good hand.</p>

<p>"D...don't...m'OK," she told the guilty blonde.  Brooke let out a sigh
heavy with relief and nodded.</p>

<p>"As long as you're sure."</p>

<p>"Yup," Sam breathed, as the pain became managable.  To tell the
truth, she couldn't tell you exactly what was so funny about Brooke's
comment other than the fact that she hadn't had too much luck in
the `men' department to know whether or not they liked her lips.  She
was actually more interested in whether or not the blonde in front of
her did.</p>

<p>"Better?" Brooke asked anxiously when she noticed Sam's breathing had
returned to mormal.  Sam nodded.  "Good, you scared me for a second
there.  I thought I broke you.  Anyway, when do you start physical
therapy?" Sam frowned, both at the change of subject and at the
subject in question.</p>

<p>"T...tomor...row," she sighed, not at all looking forward to it.  While
she wanted to walk again, she wasn't looking forward to the pain she
knew was going to be involved in the process.  Brooke shifted
uncomfortably on the bed for a minute before speaking.</p>

<p>"Do you want, I mean, if you wouldn't mind...that is if it's OK with
you..." Brooke stammered making Sam have to stifle a giggle.</p>

<p>"I'm sup..posed to st..stutter, not you," Sam joked.  Brooked sighed,
but smiled.</p>

<p>"Shush, I was trying to ask if you wanted me to go with you to
therapy.  I mean, I want to go and be there with you.  I promised you
that you wouldn't have to go through this alone and I meant it.  Mom
and Dad either have to work or take care of Mac and I thought that
maybe you wouldn't want to be alone," Brooke looked up into the wide
brown eyes of her friend and housemate.  Sam looked, well, Sam looked
utterly shocked, to tell the truth.  And really, really relieved.</p>

<p>"Yes," Sam said without a hint of a stutter.  "Please."  </p>

<p>"You want me to go with you?  Really?"  Sam nodded.  "Great!  I was
hoping you'd let me go with you, Sam.  This means a lot to me,"
Brooke told Sam as she hugged her as tightly as she dared, not
wanting to inadvertantly hurt the brunette.  Brooke was heartened
when she felt Sam hug back just as tightly.</p>

<p>"Sounds...li...like fun," Sam said sarcastically.  Brooke giggled.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, Sam.  I'll be there for you every step of the way," Sam
shot her a semi-dirty look.</p>

<p>"Ver..ry witty, Prin..cess," she growled but the smile on her face
let Brooke know she wasn't truly mad.</p>

<p>"Sorry, poor choice of words.  My bad.  I once promised you that you
wouldn't have to go through this alone, Sam, and I meant it." Sam
tilted her head to the side as a half-remembered memory made its
presence known.</p>

<p>"I think I rem...em...ber that," she said mildly confused.  She just
couldn't remember from where.  Brooke shrugged.</p>

<p>"Well, I did, so, get used to my sparkling brand of unique company,
Sam," Sam sighed and rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord."</p>
