<!-- Dueling Banjos -->


<p>"We need to talk, and I mean really talk," Sam said quietly.  Brooke
eyed the brunette sitting calmly in the wheelchair a few feet away.
There was a look in Sam's eyes that both scared Brooke and excited
her.  Those deep chocolate eyes were looking at her with intense
interest and curiosity and something else not readibly discernible by
Brooke.  Unable to keep the intense gaze, Brooke looked away as she
responded.</p>

<p>"About what?" She heard Sam sigh.</p>

<p>"Fine, you wanna do this the hard way, suit yourself.  Do you
remember…? Why do people ask that?  Of course you do.  Anyway, prom
night, after Harrison gave us his choice and you got up and walked
away, I followed you." Brooke nodded.</p>

<p>"I remember.  God help me, I wish I could forget what happened next,"
Brooke whispered.  Sam wheeled herself a little closer.</p>

<p>"I don't want to talk about that.  A least not right now.  No, before
Nicole's own twisted version of DeathRace version 2001, when we were
talking in the lobby.  You said that it `wasn't what you wanted'."</p>

<p>"OK, I remember that too.  So?  You said the same thing.  You said
it `wasn't what you wanted either'.  So what?" Brooke asked
defensively.  She was starting to get worried about where Sam was
taking this conversation because she wasn't sure she was ready to
tell Sam the truth about her feelings yet.  Sure, things between the
two of them had been getting, interesting, lately, but she wasn't
sure if she was ready for the truth to come out, for that door to be
opened, so to speak.  She was kind of comfortable in the closet even
if was apparently getting crowded in there.</p>

<p>"So what did you mean?  What `did'you want?  How did you want it to
play out?  Did you want Harrison?" Sam asked gently.  She didn't want
to upset Brooke but some part of her needed to know what those words
had meant.  They echoed in her head late at night and haunted her
sleep.  To Sam, they seemed to hint that Brooke had wanted a
different kind of result than Harrison picking either of them and for
her own sanity, she needed to know if there was any chance that
Brooke felt the same way for her that she did for Brooke.  All
evidence lately was pointing directly to `Hell Yes' and she couldn't
stand the thought of another day passing and not knowing the truth.
And after Brooke told her that she had indeed visited Sam in her
coma, Sam had remembered her parting words.  Brooke's gentle, `I love
you' had echoed in her mind all night.</p>

<p>"God, Sam, I don't know," Brooke let her fear answer for her.  She
looked at the earnest eyes of her companion and turned the
conversation around.  "What did you mean, Sam?  You said the same
thing so, what did you really want?" </p>

<p>Sam looked away from the strangely frightened hazel eyes and thought
for a minute.  &lt;Do I just say it?  Do I just jump off the bridge and
hope the rope holds?  Will she hate me?  Be repulsed by me?  After
all this, will I lose her friendship?  Do I take the chance that I'm
reading the signals correctly?&gt; It took Sam a few more minutes to
realize that whatever the consequences, the truth was more important
to her now.  The chair underneath her reminded her of the frailty of
life and how close she came to losing her own.</p>

<p>"If I answer that question honestly, Brooke, everything changes.  I
won't be able to take it back," Sam said, her voice hushed.  Brooke's
heart flipped in her chest and she felt a jolt of adrenaline flush
through her at Sam's statement.  It took her a minute to realize she
was starting to hyperventilate.</p>

<p>"Sam, if I understand you correctly, everything did just change,"
Brooke said after she got her breathing back under control.  Sam
looked up at her in surprise.  "Tell me, Sam.  Please just tell me
what you really wanted.  I promise to listen." Sam took a deep
shuttering breath before starting to speak.  She had to do this,
there was no holding back anymore.</p>

<p>"I didn't want Harrison.  I didn't want him to pick me and hurt you.
I just wanted to keep him as a friend if it would keep you from
getting your feelings hurt but more than that I wanted," she
paused.  "I wanted…God, Brooke, haven't you noticed what's been going
on between us lately or is it just me?"</p>

<p>"I've noticed something," Brooke conceeded. &lt;Boy, have I&gt;</p>

<p>"Well, what do you suppose it is?  There's a line between flirting
and joking around and something else and I think we've wandered
into `something else'."</p>

<p>"Does that bother you?" Brooke asked nervously.  Sam shook her head.</p>

<p>"Not really, I guess.  If there's really something to it." </p>

<p>"Then finish your original thought, Sammy," Brooke suggested.  Sam
looked at her confused. "What Sam?  What did you want?" Brooke
prompted, leaning closer.  Sam looked down, away, back at Brooke and
then at her hands.</p>

<p>"You," Sam whispered as a single tear made its way down her face and
she lowered her face.  A sob of relief and joy almost escaped Brooke
as she heard that one word.  She put her hand over her mouth to
prevent it and Sam thought it meant she was horrified.  &lt;Oh God, I
was wrong!  I've lost everything!  How could I have been so stupid?&gt;  </p>

<p>More tears suddenly appeared and Brooke watched as the usually strong
and invulnerable veneer she associated with Sam suddenly
disintergrated before her eyes.  The thought that Brooke hated her
did what the accident and the subsequent inability to walk or speak
hadn't; it totally destroyed Sam McPherson.  And it scared Brooke to
watch it happen right before her eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh God," Sam whimpered as she started to cry harder, "don't hate
me.  I'm sorry.  I'll never say anything about it again." Sam
collapsed into herself and pushed away with her chair in an attempt
to escape.  Brooke lept off the couch and enveloped the suddenly
vulnerable girl in a tight hug.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sam, Sammy I don't hate you.  I could never hate someone I love
so much," she told her honestly.  Sam pulled away and looked at her.</p>

<p>"What?  You love me?  As in a sisterly way, right?" She sniffed.
Brooke smiled.</p>

<p>"Only if this is `Deliverance' country and I don't hear any dueling
banjos," she joked.  "Seriously, Sam, I said what I said that night
for the same reason.  I didn't want Harrison and I didn't want to
hurt you.  All I wanted was you.  I wanted to dance with you, talk to
you," Brooke leaned in closer to the now calmer girl, "kiss you," she
continued as she brushed her lips across Sam's.  "Those lips," Brooke
murmered as she lingered close to Sam's face.  She watched the corner
of Sam's mouth quirk up in the way only Sam's mouth could.</p>

<p>"And, what about my lips?" Sam asked, repeating her part from the
playful conversation they'd had in her hospital room a few months
earlier.  </p>

<p>"Sinful," Brooke told Sam her original thought as she pressed her own
lips against Sam's again.  She felt Sam relax into her and increase
the pressure of the kiss.  Any lingering doubt Brooke had about Sam's
feelings vanished as Sam ran a hand through her hair, drawing her
closer.  </p>

<p>"Whoa," Sam breathed after they broke apart and she could breathe
again.  She felt like her heart was going to explode inside her chest
it was beating so fast.  She was surprised Brooke couldn't hear it.  </p>

<p>"'Whoa' is an understatement.  Gee, if I had known you were such a
good kisser, Sam, I'd have done that a long time ago," Brooke said
with a laugh.  Sam smiled slyly.</p>

<p>"Oh really?  I'm a good kisser, huh?  I was thinking I could use some
more practice," Sam hinted as she leaned in again.  Brooke grinned.</p>

<p>"Here, let me help you with that." They kissed again and again until
lack of oxygen made them dizzy.  They broke apart with silly grins on
their faces.</p>

<p>"You know, this explains so much," Sam laughed, her voice husky and
thick.  Brooke was tracing Sam's lips with her fingers.</p>

<p>"Like what?" Brooke asked, still staring at the lips she obsessed
about for so long and wanted so badly to kiss again.</p>

<p>"Why our relationship was always the way it was," Sam said in between
kisses.</p>

<p>"Ummm hummm," Brooke answered.  Reallly, she was listening.  Sam
smiled.</p>

<p>"Attention span of a sand mite and libido of a horny rabbit on crank,
that's my Brooke," Brooke nuzzled her nose into Sam's neck.</p>

<p>"I like the sound of `your Brooke'," Brooke whispered as a few tears
fell.  Sam wiped them away with a frown on her face.</p>

<p>"What's with these, Princess?" she asked gently.  Brooke looked up
into Sam's eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that this is a dream and my alarm clock is about to go
off.  You'll be in the next room and I'll still be pining away for
you but never able to reach out to you like I yearn to," she
explained as more tears fell.  Tears dripped down Sam's face
too.  "God, Sammy, if you only knew how much I need you, the way my
body craves you." Sam lifted Brooke's face to meet hers in a
passionate kiss.</p>

<p>"I think I do know, Brooke.  And you are my Brooke, now and forever.
This is no dream, no illusion, or trick being played upon you or me
by some celestial being for the enjoyment of the cosmic masses.  You
don't ever have to fear losing me, Brooke.  My heart is and always
has been, always will be yours and no one else's.  Nothing will ever
change that," Sam confessed, setting off a new onslaught of tears,
these happy ones, down Brooke's face.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Sam, that was beautiful," she sobbed.  Sam held her
closer.</p>

<p>"So are you, Brooke," Sam told her softly.  Brooke pulled away
slightly and looked up at her.</p>

<p>"You were saying?  About our relationship?"</p>

<p>"Oh!  Yeah, our relationship has always been push and pull, give and
take, poke and prod, fire and ice, oil and water…"</p>

<p>"I get the point, Sammy, move on to your point please," Brooke
joked.  Sam rolled her eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm trying to say that we've always seemed to be pulling at each
other, trying to get something from the other that we didn't
understand.  I certainly never would have seen this coming." Brooke
nodded her agreement.</p>

<p>"Me neither, especially since I thought you were straight," Sam
arched an eyebrow.</p>

<p>"This coming from Miss Homecoming Queen, Head Cheerleader, I Used to
Date the Quarterback girl.  Yeah, like anyone could have seen this
one coming."</p>

<p>"Speaking of which, how do we tell Mom and Dad?" Brooke asked.  Sam
winced.</p>

<p>"And she throws the bucket of cold water on my raging hormones.  No
hanky panky for Brookie-poo tonight," Brooke pouted.  "Hey, your
fault for mentioning Mike and Mom.  Seriously?  I haven't a clue, I
could barely tell you for God's sake.  How about we just enjoy it for
a while and figure it out later?" Brooke nodded.</p>

<p>"Works for me.  So, no hanky panky?" she pouted some more.  Sam shook
her head.</p>

<p>"'Fraid not.  But heavy petting is OK, lots of heavy petting."</p>
