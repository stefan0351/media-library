<p>A few days later, Brooke reluctantly ventured away from the hospital
to the one place she really didn't want to go, juvenile hall.  They
were keeping Nicole here despite her families protests under worry
that she was a flight risk.  With all the money the Julian family had
as well as their ovewhelming desire to save face, it probably wasn't
far from the mark.  But Brooke felt a visit to her former best friend
was in order since no one else had been by to see her. It had
silently been agreed upon, by some unspoken rule that Nicole was
strictily off-limits.</p>

<p>Nicole was led into the room and Brooke almost laughed.  There
stripped of all her rich coverings, her makeup, Gucci and Prada
clothing and airs was the real Nicole Julian.  No muss, no fuss.  No
contact lenses either and her hair hanging down.  Oddly enough, the
girl was still attractive, if somewhat subdued in her homely orange
jumpsuit.  When she saw Brooke her face lit up for a second but
quickly shut down again.</p>

<p>"I'm going to guess and say this isn't a social visit, B?" Nicole
asked quietly.  Brooke glared at her from across the table for a
minute. Nicole sighed.  "If there was anything I could do to change
what I did..."</p>

<p>"Stop, Nicole, just stop it.  I don't believe a word that comes out
of your mouth so just shut up," Brooke hissed.  Nicole looked away,
hurt by the words but understanding where they were coming from.  She
saw the anger and rage in Brooke's eyes the same as she did the night
of the accident.  She took a good look at the girl in front of her
and barely recognized her former friend.  Brooke's eyes were dull and
red instead of lively and energetic and her face was ashen.  The
thought that Sam had died filled Nicole with a terror and grief that
she hadn't felt since her Nana had died.</p>

<p>"Is Sam..." she choked, unable to finish the sentence.  Brooke threw a
few photos on the table for her to see.</p>

<p>"Still alive, no thanks to you.  Here, take a good look at your
handiwork, Nic.  She probably won't appreciate the fact that I took
these pictures but I thought you would want to see the outcome of
your little drunken driving spree. You should be proud.  You never
liked her anyway.  Now she lies in a coma, dead to the world and you
put her there.  You did because she was trying to protect me from
you." </p>

<p>Nicole's hands picked up the photos of their own free will and she
looked at them reluctantly.  There was Sam, lying deathly still
wrapped in more gauze than King Tut and hooked up to more wires than
Nicole guessed were attached to her VCR.  Her head was swathed in
bandages almost totally hiding her hair; her face was a mottled
pattern of purple and black bruises and cuts.  Sam's right arm was in
a cast, her left knee in a brace and in traction.  Her right leg was
in a cast also and she had one of those hideous collars on to keep
her neck straight.  Nicole felt her stomach roll and she closed her
eyes as a tear fell unbidden down her cheek.</p>

<p>"What you can't see in those pictures are the damages inside.  She's
paralyzed, Nic.  The doctor's aren't sure if she'll walk again.
Congratulations, you sure did a bang up job.  Pardon the pun.  Are
you happy?" Brooke spat angrily.  Nicole set the pictures down,
opened her eyes, and faced the irate blonde across from her.</p>

<p>"How could you honestly think I could be happy?  God, Brooke, I'm a
bitch, not a psycho.  I wasn't in my right mind when I did this.  I
never would hurt anyone, you or Spam, er, Sam intentionally.  Yes,
there were times that I may have wished bodily harm on her but Jesus
I never actually meant it.  Whether you want to believe it or not,
somewhere deep inside, I do actually have a heart," Nicole said
softly.  It was true, she did, she just spent so long hiding it that
she forgot it was there most of the time.</p>

<p>"You're right, Nic, I don't believe you," Brooke growled.  A few more
tears slipped down Nicole's face.</p>

<p>"That's not fair, Brooke.  You were the best friend I ever had..."</p>

<p>"And yet you tried to kill me!  Some way to pay back my friendship!
Since that failed what are you going to try next?  Arsenic in my diet
Pepsi?  Shoot me in the back, God knows you stabbed me there enough,"
Brooke continued her tirade.  Normally Nicole would be impressed by
the way Brooke was unleashing her inner bitch but right now all it
was serving to do was hurt her.</p>

<p>"It was an accident for Christ's sake!  I was drunk and upset!  I was
wrong and I admit that.  If I didn't do you honestly think I'd be
sitting here in this God-awful outfit?  Without makeup?  I know that
you can never forgive me, I can't forgive mysef but at least know
that I'm sorry, Brooke.  It's all I have left to give you," Nicole
finished, hanging her head down.  Brooke stood up.</p>

<p>"It's not enough, Nicole.  It'll never be enough after what you've
done.  So save your crocodile tears and your apologies for someone
who gives a rat's ass.   I came here so you could see the damage
you've caused.  Keep the pictures as a  reminder because I live with
the reality each day," Brooke's voice finally cracked.  "I hope it
brings you joy as you rot in this Hell." Brooke banged on the door
and waited for the guard to let her out.</p>

<p>"One more thing, Nic," Brooke added, her voice low, menacing.  "Think
about this: Sam leapt in front of that car to save me because she
cares about me.  She's capable of thinking about someone other than
herself.  If it was you in my place that night, do you honestly think
anyone would have done the same thing for you?  Would anyone have
risked their life for yours?  Now tell me which hurts more; getting
hit by the car or the knowledge that there isn't a living soul on
this planet that gives a damn whether you live or die?  Not even me?"
The guard finally let her out, leaving Nicole at the table crying.</p>

<p>"I said I was sorry," she wept.  And she really and truly was.</p>
