<!-- Ambulances And Gauze -->

<p>Sam lost consciousness on the way to the hospital and Brooke
was scared.  She had no illusions about how bad Sam's injuries were,
she knew enough from both her and Harrison's time in the hospital to
know bad when she saw it.  There was just so much blood.  &lt;How can so
much blood come from such a small person&gt; she wondered to herself.
&lt;And how could she lose that much and still live?&gt;  The very thought
of losing Sam was nearly enough to destroy the small measure of
control Brooke still had over her turbulant emotions.  </p>

<p>Growing up, she and Sam were never friends.  Enemies would be too
soft a word.  Archenemies, nemesis, whatever you called it, they
never traveled in the same circles and never got along.  She never
understood what it was that kept them at arm's length but there was
always a wall between them, either of their own creation or something
elses.  They both let whatever it was run their lives when there was
a pretty good chance that they could have gotten along.  But it was
easier to hate each other than to undo years of history.  And then to
Brooke it was like her world collapsed in on itself when her father
announced he was involved with Sam's mother Jane.  That was it, her
life was over because now she was going to have to put up with and,
(Jesus Christ, are you kidding?), live with her worst enemy.  Sam had
always been out to destroy or hurt her, in Brooke's opinion.  How was
she supposed to live with that?</p>

<p>But little by little, as time wore on and they both realized that the
thing between their parents wasn't going to go away, they got to know
each other, albeit reluctantly at first.  Brooke discovered that Sam
wasn't just a cold-hearted, out-for-a-story reporter, and that there
was genuine warmth and feeling underneath the kind of detacted and
aloof front that Sam presented.  And Brooke discovered that the death
of Sam's father was one of the reasons the girl held herself a bit
apart from those around her.  Sam was hurt very deeply by the loss
and never fully recovered from it.  Brooke was beginning to see past
the defenses Sam had built to prevent people from getting too close
and she liked what she saw, probably more than she should.</p>

<p>Lately Brooke was finding more and more of her time being consumed by
thoughts of her soon-to-be stepsister, and they weren't entirely
sisterly thoughts either.  No, most of her thoughts lately would
definitely qualify her for a special episode of Jerry Springer before
they'd qualify for her for anything else.  `Formerly Straight

<p>&lt;Now there's an episode Mary Cherry'd watch&gt; Brooke scoffed to
herself as she clutched Sam's frighteningly cold hand in her own.
She stroked the back of Sam's hand with her thumb as she prayed to
any God that would listen to help Sam through this.  Not for her own
selfish reasons, although they did factor in, but for the rest of the
family too.</p>

<p>"Hang in there, Sammy," Brooke whispered, unconsciously still using
an affectionate form of Sam's name.  "Think about Mom and Dad, OK,
Mike to you.  He doesn't mind that, really.  He understands.  Think
about little MacKenzie.  I need you to help me be a big sister to
her.  I don't know what I'm doing.  We helped bring her into this
world, Sam, you can't check out on me now, OK?"  The paramedic
sitting nearby put his hand on her shoulder in support as she started
to sob.  Brooke looked up into his sympathetic green eyes and he
smiled.</p>

<p>"She's holding her own, miss.  Don't count her out.  She's your
sister?"  Brooke nodded and smiled fondly at the unconscious girl.</p>

<p>"Soon to be step sister, yeah.  We have a new baby sister at home and
I need Sam to help me with her," Brooke explained in between tears.
The paramedic nodded in understanding.</p>

<p>"Look, I won't lie to you.  Your sister's in rough shape but the fact
that she was conscious for as long as she was and is holding on now
tells me that she's a fighter.  Hold on to that.  I know it's a
cliché, and a bad one at that but it really does mean something when
someone fights this hard.  I've been around long enough to know."
Brooke reached up and wiped away her tears with her free hand.</p>

<p>"Thanks," she said simply, somehow feeling a little better.  She
turned her attention back to the unconscious brunette lying in front
of her.  More and more often of late, Brooke found herself lost in
thought about Sam and everything about her from her hair and eyes to
her voice, laugh, and personality.  It was becoming increasingly
clear to Brooke that her feelings for Sam were getting very
complicated.  Not just because of their familial situation, which was
bound to make things awkward for her to say the least if Sam ever
found out, but also because she was pretty darn sure Sam was
straight.  </p>

<p>&lt;Why can't anything in my life be easy?&gt; Brooke thought to herself as
the ambulance hit a bump.  &lt;Of all the people in the world to fall
head over heels for, it had to be Sam.  I should have picked someone
more attainable like Cindy Crawford or Gwynth herself&gt; she laughed
silently.  &lt;I'd have a better chance with either of them than I ever
will with sweet, straight Sam&gt;</p>

<p>Her relationship with Josh had been nice but it had always lacked
something vital, something she could never seem to put into words.
With Josh, Brooke always felt like she was there because it was her
obligation as head cheerleader to date him.  He was a nice, sweet guy
and all and she really had cared for him but he didn't make her feel
the way she felt she should have if she was truly in love.  But the
way she felt whenever Sam was near; her legs turned to jelly, her
stomach did flip-flops and she got light headed all in a positive
way. That was how she thought she should have felt with Josh.  There
was a passion involved with Sam that she lacked with Josh.  It was
evident in their fights.  And it was like nothing she ever
experienced before.</p>

<p>It had confused her at first, when she realized that her former rival
and her father's fiancee's daughter were causing the feelings.  What
was it about the girl that wound her up like a brand new Christmas
toy?  Maybe it was the unflinching way Sam approached everything in
her life or the way she refused to be unswayed or detered in her
journey for the truth, even her own slightly sckewered version of
it.  </p>

<p>Maybe it was the quiet vulnerablity hidden underneath the strong
front the girl presented.  Brooke had spent her entire life trying to
live up to the ideals others had set out in front of her while Sam
did her own thing and Brooke envied that.  Maybe it was the big brown
eyes that exuded warmth and mischief or the long brown hair that hung
around Sam's shoulders like a soft security blanket just waiting for
Brooke to wrap herself in, but whatever it was Brooke had fallen and
fallen hard.  And she really wasn't sure she minded anymore.</p>

<p>So here she was, holding the alarmingly still hand of the one person
she didn't have to pretend around, the one person she felt free and
truly relaxed around and praying not to lose her just as she realized
how deeply she cared for and needed her.  &lt;Just hang on a little
longer, Sammy, please&gt;</p>
