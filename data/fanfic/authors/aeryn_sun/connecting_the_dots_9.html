<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Nine -->

<p>"Oh, you have GOT to be kidding me," Sam mumbled a week later as she held a
bundle of wires she assumed had something to do with hooking up her new DVD
player. </p>
<p>"Read the directions? Who me? Ha! Never!" she mocked herself as she bent over
the console. She was seriously considering just tying the damn things in a big
ole knot and beating the guy at the electronics store senseless with it. </p>
<p>"Problems, Sammy?" Brooke asked as she walked in from the bathroom. Her first
view was of Sam's ass, clad in tight denim shorts, bent over the television
console at a strange angle. Her breath caught in her throat and her heart
pounded in her ears as she watched Sam move around. </p>
<p>"I can't figure this damn thing out," Sam grumbled, still partially hidden by
the stand. Brooke smirked at Sam's back and walked over. She leaned over Sam,
draping her body over the brunette's. She felt Sam jump slightly at the contact.
She herself savored the warmth she could feel coming from Sam's body. </p>
<p>"Anything I can do to help?" she whispered huskily, resting one hand in the
middle of Sam's back. She knew that her behavior was out of character for the
old Brooke and wondered what Sam thought of it. But she was also very aware that
it was perfectly in character for who she was now. She had to surpress a giggle
at that thought. </p>
<p>"Uh..." Sam stammered as Brooke continued to breathe in her ear. "I don't
suppose you know how to hook this thing up?" she managed to squeak out. Brooke
used her free hand to cover Sam's hand that held one of the plugs and guided it
into the A/V port in the back of the VCR. </p>
<p>"Let's see how that works," she purred. She was really enjoying the close
contact with Sam a little too much. She felt a small tremor pass through Sam at
the tone of her voice. </p>
<p>"OK," Sam said backing up some. Brooke stayed well within Sam's personal
envelope as the journalist popped a disk in the player and pressed play. As the
MENU to the movie appeared, Sam turned to give Brooke a 'thank-you' smile and
found herself nose to nose with the girl. </p>
<p>"Uhm...thanks," she whispered. Brooke being that close with no obvious
intention of moving was causing Sam's brain to short circuit. All she could
think about was how warm Brooke was and how good she smelled. Brooke's tongue
darted out to lick her pink lips, leaving a wet trail and Sam's knees all but
buckled. Her head felt light and she gulped in air as she began to
hyperventilate. </p>
<p>(Get a grip, McPherson!) she screamed internally. (With the memory loss,
Brooke probably doesn't see anything wrong or uncomfortable with the situation.
She's just being herself. And here I am being driven to a puddle by my hormones.
God, she isn't even aware of what she's doing to me) Sam lamented. </p>
<p>Brooke, however, was acutely aware of Sam's reaction to her close quarters.
She could see the flush in Sam's cheeks, the increase in respiration and was
standing close enough to see the way Sam's pupils had dilated. And she was
beyond ecstatic to know that she was causing that reaction in the girl she
herself cared for so much. </p>
<p>(Oh my God! She likes me! Sam likes me!) Brooke thought gleefully as she
realized that her feelings may not be as one sided as she originally feared. </p>
<p>Sam stepped away and took a visible effort to calm herself. She then turned
back to Brooke with a vague smirk. </p>
<p>"So, whatcha up to today?" Sam asked calmly. Brooke smiled back, recognizing
Sam's retreat into familiar territory. Since she had an inkling that Sam might
like her as well, she was willing to let Sam go for now. </p>
<p>"Nothing much," she answered reaching into her pocket for a pack of candy. "I
thought I'd clean the room, make it more comfortable for me," she explained
referring to her room. She still didn't like it and spent most of her time in
Sam's room. "You?" </p>
<p>"Errands and a lunch date," Sam stuck out her tongue. Brooke wagged her
eyebrows. </p>
<p>"Anyone I know?" she teased. Sam rolled her eyes and sighed. </p>
<p>"Harrison," she groaned. "Apparently, he wants to have a 'chat'." She held up
her hands and put quotes around the word chat. Brooke could tell by the sarcasm
in Sam's voice exactly what the brunette thought of the idea. </p>
<p>"Rather have a root canal, would ya?" Brooke joked around a mouthful of
candy. Sam laughed. </p>
<p>"Without novacaine, by Dr. Kevorkian with a rusty rail spike," she clarified.
Brooke started to laugh. </p>
<p>"Lovely imagery, thank you," she snickered. Sam shrugged. </p>
<p>"I try," she said with a smile. She watched as Brooke picked through the
candy in her hand and then popped a select few in her mouth. It was one of the
new things about Brooke, an obsession with sugar. She loved the stuff. And she
couldn't give a rat's ass about her figure either. Sam smiled. </p>
<p>"What've you got there?" she asked as Brooke again picked through the candy.
Brooke stared at the candy in her hand. A devilish thought entered her head and
she decided to play with Sam's mind a little. </p>
<p>"Skittles," she said. Sam walked over. </p>
<p>"What are you doing to them?" she asked as Brooke again selected through
them. Brooke chuckled lowly. She was going to love this. </p>
<p>"I'm 'tasting the rainbow', Sammy," she said slyly, watching Sam out of the
corner of her eye. She was hoping Sam was quick enough to understand the double
meaning. The way Sam's eyes widened for a second told Brooke that she was. </p>
<p>"Oh really?" Sam challenged with a slight blush. Brooke turned so that she
was right in Sam's face again. </p>
<p>"Really," she answered. "The pink ones are my favorite," she whispered
closing in on Sam. "Want one?" </p>
<p>Sam swallowed hard as the innuendo of Brooke's comments shook her right
through. </p>
<p>(There's no way she means that the way it sounds, is there?) she wondered.
</p>
<p>"Sure," she whispered past the sudden lump in her throat. Brooke lifted a
Skittle and slid it into Sam's mouth. She watched as Sam slowly chewed on the
candy. </p>
<p>"It's good, huh?" she asked quietly. Sam nodded mutely watching Brooke
intently. Brooke smiled to herself, loving the sudden hold she had over Sam.
"What time do you have to meet Harrison?" she asked, ending the game and
breaking the rising sexual tension between them. </p>
<p>Sam let out a breath like a balloon popping at Brooke's question. She was
slightly annoyed when she realized that Brooke had just teased the Hell out of
her. She then glanced at her watch and winced. </p>
<p>"Damn, I have to get dressed or I'll be late." When Brooke made no effort to
leave, Sam arched an eyebrow at her. </p>
<p>"That was your que to leave, toots. I don't give free shows," she teased
dramatically to get back at the blonde. Brooke blushed and then reached into her
pocket again. </p>
<p>"How much for the whole shebang?" she asked innocently. Sam's eyes grew
incredibly wide and her eyebrows shot to the top of her forehead. </p>
<p>"BROOKE!" Sam exclaimed sounding at once amused and shocked. Brooke put her
hands up in the universal sign of peace and started backing out of the room. </p>
<p>"OK, OK, I'm going. Spoil sport." </p>
