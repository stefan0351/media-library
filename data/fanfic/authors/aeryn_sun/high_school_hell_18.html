<!-- High School Hell \ School Daze -->

<p>School had actually started to calm down shortly afterwards. There was less vandalism and harrassment but both girls figured that had to do with both Pierce going to a mental institution and the school board finally doing something about the whole situation. And a few other students had come out as well so it wasn't just Brooke and Sam out on that limb. Brooke's popularity was soaring again, after the initial shock wore off and aside from a few minor incidents, their lives had returned to what passed for normal for them. </p>
<p>It was a welcome relief. Now they could look forward to the Senior Prom, if either decided to go although the school board had made it clear that couples were to be boy-girl and nothing else; and graduation after that. Sam had pretty much decided against the prom (like last years wasn't fun enough) and was focusing on graduation in a few months while Brooke was just trying to get through each day. But for now, things were good. </p>
<p>Well, unless you were Becky Wright that is. Thanks to Nicole's master manipulation and string pulling, not even April Tuna and Freddy Gong would have anything to do with that little pariah. She had to transfer to another school just to finish the school year because she couldn't function at Kennedy High with the way she was being treated. Sam and Brooke felt bad, and then they got over it. What goes around really does come around. </p>

<p>Brooke walked into Sam's bedroom and watched Sam get ready for bed. While she was happy she got one dance with Sam at the wedding a few days earlier, she wasn't satisfied yet. She put a cd in Sam's stereo and set it up before walking over to Sam. </p>
<p>"Dance with me?" Brooke asked extending her hand to Sam. Sam smiled and nodded. </p>
<p>"Of course," she responded. Brooke pressed play on the stereo and pulled Sam close to her. The soft sound of a piano filled the room as they started to dance. </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">If I whisper my thoughts <br>
Would you hear the chanting of my heart <br>
Praising melodies unsung in the dark <br>
Saying hold me through the night </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Hear the music from my room <br>
Calling out to you, come home to me soon <br>
Shadows bellowing duets with the moon <br>
Singing hold me through the night </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Hold me through the night <br>
Hold me through the night </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Oh yeah <br>
Oh yeah yeah oh </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">And the water drops in the drain <br>
Just like the sound it makes <br>
You're coming round again <br>
There's a soft piano in a warm summer's rain <br>
Playing hold me through the night </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Hold me through the night <br>
Hold me through the night <br>
Hold me <br>
Hold me through the night <br>
Hold me <br>
Hold me through the night <br>
Oh ya gotta hold me through <br>
Ya gotta hold me through the night <br>
Hold me through the night </font> </p>
<p>The song ended but neither girl let go. They simply clung to one another and continued to move together even without music to move to. </p>
<p>"Always, you know?" Sam whispered. "I'll never let go." Brooke smiled into Sam's neck. </p>
<p>"Me either, Sam. Forever." Now she was satisfied.</p>
