<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part One -->

<p>Brooke smiled slightly as she steered her car down the familiar sunlit streets. It was a half-smile really, born of a relaxed complacency with her life and a restless boredom as well. She wasn't unhappy with the way things were, per se, but she knew, she felt that there was something sorely lacking in her life. Something that would help give her drive or purpose. Or at least put some sort of spark into her life. She was just clueless as to what that something was. </p>
<p>She'd been dating Harrison since Prom night, a night which in itself they were all lucky to have survived. Thanks to Sam's fast actions and Nicole's last second reality check, the Jaguar had missed everyone and collided with a fire hydrant instead. When the excitement was over, Nicole had a hangover, Brooke had a boyfriend and Sam had, well, Sam was left on the sidelines. That was one of the things bugging Brooke. </p>
<p>Sam had risked her life that night for her. She had shoved Brooke out of the way of the speeding car and the only reason the car hadn't hit Sam herself was because Nicole had served at the last second. But what Brooke didn't understand was from that point on her relationship with Sam had been strained at best. They no longer fought like they once did but the bond that had grown between them had been severed as well. Brooke missed that closeness she shared with Sam. Ever since she started dating Harrison a month ago, she'd noticed a marked change in Sam. Sam was distant, cold and no longer seemed willing to spend extended periods of time in Brooke's presence. Brooke knew that somehow Harrison was the wedge between them. </p>
<p>Harrison. Exactly how did Brooke feel about him? She honestly didn't have a clue. Yes, he was a nice guy; sweet, honest, and doted on her every whim but there was just something missing. Some spark that she felt she needed to keep her interest piqued. She felt bad that after all this time she felt nothing for him other than friendship when it was obviously something more for him. She just had no idea how to back out of it now. She cursed herself because on top of hurting Sam, she was going to hurt Harrison. </p>
<p>(Yup, I'm a winner) she thought sarcastically. (Bet Sam would have something witty to say about that if she weren't off in San Diego) </p>
<p>Brooke missed Sam a lot. She was off on an internship at a newspaper in San Diego. The budding journalist all but jumped at the opportunity to learn the newspaper business and, Brooke figured, put some mileage between them. Brooke missed their late night talks, quiet dinners when the parentals were out of town and just the simple activity of playing with Mac along with Sam. It was the sweetest thing, in Brooke's opinion, to watch Sam and Mac interact with each other. Sam was so wary of the baby but when she thought no one was looking, she was open and genuine with the child. Brooke loved to see that side of Sam. It was a rare treat. </p>
<p>Sam called once in a while but usually spoke to Jane and when she did speak to Brooke her voice was short and her sentences clipped. Sometimes it was more painful to talk to her than not to. Gone was the easy flowing banter that they had become accustomed to. It was replaced by the old stilted conversation that plagued them when Sam and her mother first moved into the Palace. Brooke missed the warmth that had she'd recently come to recognize in Sam's voice. The slight snicker that would creep into Sam's low tones when she thought something was amusing. Now Sam sounded cold and analytical. The chasm between them was growing and no matter what Brooke tried to do she could not seem to bridge the distance between them. </p>
<p>It was stupid in Brooke's opinion to be losing the person who was essentially her best friend because of a boy. A boy who, incidentally, she really wasn't interested in having a romantic relationship with. She had thought she was interested in him but the truth was she wasn't. Now because of that she was losing Sam and was going to hurt Harrison. Not that the latter really bothered her; Harrison was resiliant. He'd recover. But losing Sam and knowing that she'd hurt her however inadvertantly really made Brooke feel really guilty. She'd never want to hurt Sam in any way. But she hadn't realized that Sam was that interested in Harrison. Mildly interested maybe but not so much so that she'd be so upset at losing him. Although Brooke thought that had more to do with losing him to her, her former enemy than actually losing him at all. There were times when unfortunately she and Sam both still let their jealousies get the better of them. </p>
<p>She thought that it was sad that after all this time and after all the progress they'd made in their relationship that she and Sam still fell back on old habits. They still let their petty jealousies and need to outdo one another get in the way of their friendship and growing bond as stepsisters at times. And Brooke knew she was as much to blame for that as Sam was. She had felt a small flash of triumph when Harrison had chosen her that night. But that had quickly been crushed by an overwhelming feeling of guilt at having hurt Sam. The look of utter hurt and betrayal on Sam's face had actually wounded Brooke because she knew in that instant that she'd caused Sam pain. And along with her guilt, there was an out of place feeling of fear that she still didn't understand. Part of her had an idea what was causing it but a bigger part of her shoved the possibilities deeper within. She wasn't ready to examine them just yet. </p>
<p>So, as she turned on to Oak St. and let the familiar road lull her deeper into thought, Brooke pondered her choices. She couldn't keep stringing Harrison along that much was certain. It wasn't fair to the poor boy when there was obviously nothing going to come from the relationship. Hurting him now with the inevitable truth was better than waiting even longer and really doing damage to him somewhere down the line. That decided, Brooke also knew that she had to do something to repair the rift in her relationship with Sam. What, she didn't know but Sam meant far too much to her for Brooke to just lose her without a fight. Without knowing anything else, Brooke knew she needed Sam in her life in some way. In some positive way. She just had to find a way to make Sam see that. But knowing Sam and the girl's infamous stubborn streak, it was probably going to be easier said than done. </p>
<p>Still, with the outlines of a framework plan in her mind Brooke felt a little better. Not a lot but at least a little less confused. She had to end things with Harrison and fix things with Sam. She and Sam needed to have a very long heart to heart talk. She sighed and refocused her attention on the road. And then she saw it. The brightly colored bouncing ball crossing the road in front of her car. She knew with a dreaded certainty what would be following behind it and prayed that she was wrong. But as she slammed on her brakes there it was, a wide-eyed, blonde haired little girl no older than four suddenly frozen in fright in front of her car. A small part of her brain took a moment to laugh absurdly at the irony of the situation as she violently wrenched the wheel to the side in a desperate attempt to avoid hitting the innocent little girl. </p>
<p>"SHIT!" she managed to scream, as the tires squealed and the car tilted precariously before she lost control entirely. The large tree heading towards her car at an alarming speed was the last thing Brooke saw. </p>
