<!-- Moment by Moment \ 5. Recovering -->

<p>OK, she's staring at me like I'm a space alien. That can't
be a good sign.</p>
<p>I woke up this morning to find her staring at me from the
bathroom door. She'd obviously just gotten out of the shower
(thankfully, finally. Her hair was starting to look dread-locked)
She was wrapped in a towel, standing in my doorway looking at me with
keen interest. I think her gaze might be what woke me, I'm not sure,
but as soon as I opened my eyes, she ran back to her own room. It
was the strangest thing. But at least she wasn't standing over me
with a shovel. </p>
<p>That's me, always got to find that bright side of things.</p>
<p>Now I'm sitting on the couch, flipping through Saturday
afternoon TV (Jesus is there ANYTHING worth watching anymore) and
she's standing by the armchair watching me like I'm a rabid dog about
to attack.</p>
<p>OK, she's making me really nervous.</p>
<p>"Sit down, say something, or leave the room, Sam before you
drive me insane," I ask, making her jump slightly. She apparently
wasn't expecting me to speak. Arf arf. "Granted it's a short drive
but still, don't help."</p>
<p>She sits in the armchair as if on command, and it irks me
slightly but I don't say anything. She folds her legs up to her
chest and wraps her arms around them. She's effectively folded into
herself and makes a frighteningly small package now. She looks so
frail that it scares me.</p>
<p>"Why did you do it?" she asks in a small voice, her brown
eyes much too wide in her face as she watches me. I bite my lip and
decide to stall her.</p>
<p>"Do what, Sam? I've done so many questionable things
lately." Well, isn't THAT the truth?</p>
<p>"You have to narrow it down," I continue when she's just
patiently quiet. I'm still looking at the TV and wondering why we
bother paying for cable anymore.</p>
<p>"Are you referring to why I parked on the street? Why I
switched from Dove soap to Irish Spring? Why I voted for Nikki and
not Kelly on American Idol? Give me a hint here, Sam."</p>
<p>I have answers to all of those, by the way.</p>
<p>She clears her throat and shakes her head.</p>
<p>"Why did you attack Nicole?" she clarifies, her voice still
whisper soft. It's a nice change from the screaming growl I've been
subjected to lately. I shrug nonchalantly and feel a blush burn my
ears but don't really understand the reason for it.</p>
<p>"She deserved it," I say simply. God did she. Girlfriend
deserved being beaten like a redheaded stepchild on a family
holiday. Or at least hit with a large, heavy object repeatedly.</p>
<p>Heh, I know. I'll kill her and then have OJ go look for the
real killer. Ha ha, I amuse me.</p>
<p>"I thought you helped her," she says, hanging her head in
shame. Oh Sammy, don't take more blame in this. </p>
<p>I get up from the couch and kneel next to her chair, brushing
the hair away from her face. It's shiny and gleaming again, soft to
the touch.</p>
<p>"I'd never do anything like that, Sammy. But especially to
you," I say gently. I don't want to say too much and spook her. She
nods against my hand and sighs. </p>
<p>"I know?I'm sorry," she sniffs as I see a few tears fall past
her curtain of hair that's hiding her face from me. I lift her head
to face me and look her directly in the eyes. I know it's important
for her to understand what I'm about to say.</p>
<p>"There's nothing for you to be sorry for, Sam. Nicole hurt
you terribly and you reacted to that. I don't blame you at all so
don't blame yourself. Don't worry about it, I forgive you," I speak
slowly and calmly, ending my talk with a small smile. She collapses
into my arms, startling me but I wrap my arms around her and let her
cry.</p>
<p>"Thank you, I'm sorry?" she babbles. I pet her hair and rock
her slightly as she sobs loudly and uncontrollably.</p>
<p>"WHY?" she screeches. "She USED me? WHY? Why did she have
to hurt me like that?"</p>
<p>Sadly I have no answers for her. But thankfully she also
knows that. I'm only here to comfort her, not answer her soul's
questions right now.</p>
<p>Mom comes in from grocery shopping and passes us on the
living room floor, giving me a questioning look that I just wave off
over Sam's shoulder. Jane nods and heads into the kitchen assuming
that I have Sam under control. At least Sam's out of her room and
talking to me, I realize. That's a good start at least.</p>
<p>"Why, Brooke?" she continues, mumbling into my shirt which is
now soaked with her tears and pain. "I swear I never did anything to
her. What did I do to deserve what she did to me?" She looks up at
me with those eyes imploring me for an answer and I can't stay quiet
anymore. I have to try and piece my beloved Sammy back together.</p>
<p>"You didn't do anything, Sammy," I soothe, rubbing gentle
circles on the girl's back as she hiccups and still sobs in my arms.
She's quieter now though, having grown tired from all the emotional
turmoil. She's settled into my lap, almost like a child. It'd be
precious if she wasn't hurting so bad right now.</p>
<p>"Nicole," I start and stop to pick through my words
carefully. "Nicole is a cruel, heartless bitch." Yeah, that about
sums it up. "I don't know whether she went after you to get at me,
really, or if it was something else. Sam, let's be honest, you know
that I like you right?"</p>
<p>She looks at me, eyes impossibly wide but bright with
understanding and nods.</p>
<p>"Yeah," she sniffs. I look at her intently.</p>
<p>"I mean `like you' in a way that's likely to give your mother
a stroke and send my father to the funny farm `like', got that?" She
smiles slightly and nods again.</p>
<p>"Uh huh, got it," she whispers, staring suddenly at my lips.</p>
<p>Damn that's distracting.</p>
<p>"Uhm?" Oh, that was intelligent sounding, Brooke. Gah. "So,
anyway, Nicole kind of knew how I felt too. And I think that somehow
this might have been partially my fault because you KNOW how she has
some sort of pathological need to outdo me. And I'm afraid that you
became just something else to beat me at, Sammy. And I'm so very
sorry for that."</p>
<p>"Not your fault, Brooke," she sighs again and then rests her
head against my chest. It's kind of nice being able to be this close
and not worry about bodily harm. Now if I could just erase her pain
I'd accomplish all my life's work.</p>
<p>"Nicole?she?she?*groan*," Sam doesn't finish her sentence,
just buries her face deeper into my shirt as if trying to hide. I
think leaving it open makes me feel worse than if she HAD finished it.</p>
<p>"Sam, I hate to ask this but?I need to know," I feel the
words choking themselves out as I try not to be sick here on the
floor. And I wonder why the need to know is so strong. Perhaps to
finish off the last few remaining remnants of my friendship to
Nicole? Or complete my total hatred of her. Either way I can't help
Sam without the absolute truth.</p>
<p>"Did she?? I mean was it?rape?" God, I can barely even say the
word. How must it be for Sam to LIVE with it?</p>
<p>She whimpers and pulls me painfully close. Her grip on me is so
tight I can feel bruises forming under her fingers. But that's OK;
she needs me right now.</p>
<p>She's quiet for a long time and I start to think that maybe I pushed
too far.</p>
<p>"For it to be rape, I would have had to have said `no', right?" she
suddenly asks quietly. "I mean, I did at first, but I gave in.
So, `no', right?"</p>
<p>Aw damn. Tricky slope, Sammy. And I think we just crashed down it.
Damn, if I hated Nic before, I loathe her now.</p>
<p>How could Nicole even??</p>
<p>I mean, to even think about doing that to another human being is
just?.</p>
<p>Grrr?</p>
