<!-- High School Hell \ Picking Up The Pieces -->

<p>"She did what?" Nicole tried to decode the words between Brooke's hysterical tears and hiccups. All she was managing to do was give herself a headache. Brooke had shown up on her doorstep highly upset, tears streaming down her face and barely able to stand. </p>
<p>"She?she threw me?out?(hic)?of her?her room?She hates?(hic)?hates me," Brooke wailed burying her head in her hands and starting to cry all over again. Nic couldn't believe what she was hearing. (Sam hates Brooke? What? Why?) </p>
<p>"Why, Brooke? Brooke, calm down and tell me exactly what happened," Nic coaxed gently. Brooke took several deep breaths and tried to explain. </p>
<p>"I went to see her and she was so angry at me. She claimed I never loved her, I only pitied her. God, Nic, why would she think that?" Nic shrugged in confusion. She honestly had no idea where Sam would get an obscene idea like that. </p>
<p>"She said I was only with her for the attention being gay got me and that I never really loved her," Brooke sobbed, the words cutting out pieces of her heart and soul just to repeat. "She doesn't want me anymore, Nic. She hates me." Nicole hugged Brooke to comfort her. </p>
<p>"I'm sure she doesn't, Brooke. Sam's not capable of hating you, she loves you too much," Nic assured her. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"You didn't hear her, you didn't see the hatred in her eyes, Nic. Oh God, I've lost her and I don't know why!" Nic sighed. </p>
<p>"Let me talk to her. I'll see what crawled up her ass and died," she suggested. </p>
<p>"No, you'll only piss her off more!" Brooke argued. Nic arched an eyebrow. </p>
<p>"What's she gonna do? Stop speaking to you?" Brooke didn't repond. "Yeah, thought so. Let me take you home and call someone to stay with you because there is no way I'm leaving you by yourself in this condition and then I'm going to go have a chat with Spam McPherson." </p>

<p>"What the Hell do you want, Julian?" Sam growled. Nicole just glared at her. </p>
<p>"Don't pull that SuperBitch routine with me, Spam, I wrote the God Damn book. What the Hell are you pulling with Brooke? Are you trying to destroy her?" </p>
<p>"I don't know what you're talking about," Sam said haughtily.</p>
<p>"You fucking little liar! You know exactly what I'm talking about. You threw her out of here like some sort of piece of garbage and I just spent the better part of the day trying to put the pieces back together."</p>
<p>"Oh, boo hoo," Sam mockingly weeped. If she were standing closer, Nic would have slapped her. </p>
<p>"You heartless bitch, and coming from me, that's one Hell of an insult. What are you playing at, Sam?" </p>
<p>"I'm not playing at anything, Nicole. I don't want her anymore. Why can't anyone seem to follow that? Did I stop speaking English all of a sudden?" Nicole approached the bed, just in case she did need to slap some sense into Sam. </p>
<p>"You speak perfect English, you just stopped making sense," Nicole told her. Sam sighed. "Why don't you want her? She loves ou." Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"That's just it, no she doesn't," she said flatly. Nicole stuttered in shock for a second before recovering. </p>
<p>"Excuse me? We are talking about the same Brooke McQueen, right? Blonde, hazel eyes about yea tall?" Sam nodded. "How can you say she doesn't love you?" </p>
<p>"She never did, Nic, it was all talk. You taught her well, she played me like a fine fiddle. All she ever cared about was the attention she'd get by being `gay'," Sam raised her hands and used quotations around the word. "She never loved me, she pitied me to begin with, felt guilty because I was hurt instead of her. That's all this was, one big giant guilt trip that evolved into an attention getter." Nic was dumbfounded. </p>
<p>"After all you went through with telling everyone. Carmen, Harrison, Mary Cherry and Mike's horrid and violent reactions. After all that you can sit there and tell me that her feelings for you aren't genuine?" Nic asked incredulously. Sam nodded arrogantly. "God, Sam, where do you get this shit from anyway? Did Pierce hit you on the head too?" </p>
<p>"Go away, Nic," Sam said tiredly as she settled back into her bed. Nic got right up into her face. </p>
<p>"She loves you, damn it! Given the asinine way you're acting right now, why is beyond me, but she does! Why do you think she doesn't?"</p>
<p>"Because I heard her say it!" Sam screamed the pure, raw hurt and devastation in her voice driving Nicole back a few steps. "I heard her say it, all of it. That she was motivated by pity and her need for attention. She doesn't care about my feelings, she thinks this is a good laugh! Well, I'm through being the punchline for yet another Brooke McQueen joke and I'll die before I'll let her near me again! Do you understand me?" </p>
<p>"Jesus, Sam, you've got it wrong. You've got it all wrong," Nicole whispered in horror at what Sam was saying. It just couldn't be true. And Nic knew somehow that it wasn't. "Sam, where are you getting this?"</p>
<p>"Just leave me alone, Nic," Sam said defeated. Nicole approached the bed again shaking her head. </p>
<p>"Not until you tell me where you're getting these stupid and insane ideas from. Are you on too much morphine or what?" Sam glared at her with enough force for Nic to be suitably impressed but she didn't back down. Sam finally sighed and reached under her pillow and pulled out a tape recorder.</p>
<p>"Here, listen to this," Sam snapped angrily. "Listen for yourself. Hear what Brooke really thinks about me and our relationship." Nicole frowned and took the recorder. After listening to it, she had to resist the urge to retch on Sam's rug. No wonder the girl was acting the way she was. </p>
<p>"Aw, Jesus Sam," she breathed. She looked at Sam who was crumpled into a ball crying. She sat down on the bed and reached out for Sam who shied away. "Sam," she said gently. "You gotta know that ain't Brooke on that tape." Sam's head shot up. </p>
<p>"Sure as Hell sounds like her, don't it?" she asked angrily. Nic nodded reluctantly. </p>
<p>"OK, yes, it does. It is Brooke's voice, maybe even her words but they're out of context, they have to be. Take it from me, the master manipulator, she would never say those things. Someone must have taken her words and manipulated that tape to say what they wanted it to." Nic reasoned. Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Doesn't matter," she sniffed. Nicole frowned.</p>
<p>"Why not?" Sam looked at her sadly. Nicole watched, frightened, as the last sparkle of life in Sam's eyes flickered and died out. It was a frightening thing to witness. </p>
<p>"Because I don't want her back." </p>
