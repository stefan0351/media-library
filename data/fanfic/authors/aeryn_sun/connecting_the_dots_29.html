<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Twenty Nine -->

<p>Josh shifted nervously on his feet as he rang the Palace doorbell and waited for someone to answer. Since neither Brooke nor Sam had been in school Friday, he hadn't had the chance to talk to them and was forced to go their house instead. It really wasn't what he wanted to do, but he desperately felt the need to talk to at least Brooke if not them both about what he was hearing at school.</p>
<p>&lt;Sam and Brooke a couple? A romantic couple? That can't be right&gt; he shook his head. He just couldn't get his mind to wrap around the concept. He was there, front row, for the height of the animosity between Brooke and Sam. When he was absolutely sure at some point there was going to be bloodshed by one or both of them. How could they now be in love with one another? It just didn't compute in Josh Ford's brain.</p>
<p>He was about to ring again when the door swung open and Brooke appeared, pleasant smile firmly in place.</p>
<p>"Heya Josh, what can I do for you?" she asked politely. With some of her memory returning, she could recall that Josh was an OK, if somewhat thickskulled individual. After all, she had dated him for a fairly long time and lost her virginity to him. He had to have some good points, she figured.</p>
<p>"Can I come in? I uh?kinda need to talk to you about some stuff," Josh said nervously. Brooke shrugged and opened the door fully.</p>
<p>"Yeah, sure, come in." She lead him into the living room where he took a seat on the couch and watched her carefully.</p>
<p>"Want a drink or something?" she asked. Josh shook his head.</p>
<p>"Nah, I'm good. Look, are you home alone?" Brooke frowned at him.</p>
<p>"No, Sam's upstairs napping. She had a headache. Why?" Josh started to stare at his feet.</p>
<p>"Oh, no reason, I just wanted to know," he mumbled. Brooke sat down in a nearby chair.</p>
<p>"So, what did you want to talk to me about? Everything going OK with you and Lily?" she asked concerned. Josh looked up at her, sighed and nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I guess. Married life has its moments when I'm not sure we did the right thing, but they pass," he admitted. "But that wasn't what I wanted to talk about." He went back to staring at his Nikes and said nothing more.</p>
<p>"You want to know if Sam and I are really seeing each other romantically, don't you?" Brooke asked for him after a few minutes. "Only, you don't know how to ask." Josh said nothing and only nodded. Now it was Brooke's turn to sigh.</p>
<p>"It's true, Josh. Sam and I are in love, real love. Not the teen-age infatuation that you and I shared. It's?it's absolutely beautiful. I really love her, Josh. More than you can possibly understand," she said honestly.</p>
<p>"How long?" Josh whispered. Brooke arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"'How long' what? Have I loved her or have we been seeing each other?" she wondered for clarification.</p>
<p>"Have you loved her?" he said, looking back up into Brooke's eyes. Brooke saw the need to understand in Josh's blue eyes, but that was all. No anger or jealously, just curiosity. She smiled.</p>
<p>"Well, for me, since I woke up and laid eyes on her. Good God, she's a heavenly vision," she laughed. "I thought I'd died and she was an angel. But seriously, according to my diary, a very long time. I think I was crushing even when I was with you. And then the whole Harrison thing? Denial at its finest."</p>
<p>"Oh," Josh said as he let that information sink in. After a few minutes, he spoke again.</p>
<p>"Was it?was it anything I did?" he asked in a very small voice.</p>
<p>"WHAT?" Brooke said in shock. Josh shrugged and frowned.</p>
<p>"Well, I know that when we, slept together, that it wasn't everything you'd hoped. I just don't want?I'm scared that maybe it was something I did that made you start looking at women in a?sexual way," he tried to explain. Brooke tried not to laugh at him. He was so open and vulnerable that it would have just been mean.</p>
<p>"Josh, you're so sweet," she said softly. "It wasn't anything you did. Honest. Why would you wonder that?" Josh shifted uncomfortably on the couch.</p>
<p>"Uhm?er?well?Lily?that is, she kinda said something?" he hedged. Brooke leaned forward, resting her elbows on her knees, her curiosity piqued.</p>
<p>"What? What did Lily say?" she prompted him. Josh started to sweat noticeably.</p>
<p>"She urm?said that maybe there might be a time when she'd want to 'experience a woman'?sexually," he admitted in a whisper. "I'm starting to think maybe it's me. That's I'M turning women into lesbians." Brooke shook her head and bit her tongue for a minute before speaking again.</p>
<p>"Josh, I swear it's not you. I happen to know for a fact, and she'd probably kill me for telling you, but, oh well?but Lily has questioned her sexuality from time to time. But I also know that she LOVES you. So, no, it's 'not you'. OK?" Brooke assured the nervous jock. Josh let out a relieved breath and smiled at his ex-girlfriend.</p>
<p>"Thanks Brooke," he said gratefully.</p>
<p>"No problem."</p>
<p>"Brooke?" Sam's groggy voice floated down the stairs and over to the two teens in the living room. She staggered over the stairs, rubbing her hand over her eyes. "Oh, hi Josh," she mumbled in surprise at seeing him.</p>
<p>"Hey Sam," Josh said in greeting. Brooke stood up and walked over to the pj clad girl.</p>
<p>"How you feeling, sweetie?" she asked Sam, placing her hand against Sam's forehead to check for fever.</p>
<p>"My head still hurts and now my stomach is burning. I feel like shit," Sam sighed. Josh stood up and started towards the door.</p>
<p>"Hey, I'll leave you to take care of Sam, Brooke," he said politely.</p>
<p>"Josh, are we really OK?" Brooke asked. Josh smiled again and nodded.</p>
<p>"You know? Yeah, yeah we are, Brooke. I'm happy for you. All I've ever really wanted for you was for you to be happy. If Sam makes you happy, then that's all that matters," he said. He turned towards Sam. "Keep her happy, Sam. That's all I ask." Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"I'll do my best," she said, instantly understanding the conversation that had taken place in her absence. Josh nodded again, apparently satisfied and then left. Brooke rubbed Sam's back as the other girl groaned in discomfort.</p>
<p>"Feeling sick?" Sam shook her head in agreement.</p>
<p>"I think I'm coming down with something," she said.</p>
<p>"I think you're 'coming down' with an ulcer," Brooke countered, leading Sam back upstairs to bed. Sam raspberried her.</p>
<p>"Maybe," she conceded. "Who knows? At any rate, I just wish my stomach would stop hurting." </p>
<p>"Come on, let's put you back to bed," Brooke ordered softly, putting Sam back in her bed. She got some Tylenol and water, a cold compress and a bucket, just in case. She then kicked off her shoes and crawled into the bed behind Sam. She pulled the covers up over them. "Roll onto your side, Sammy," she said after Sam took the Tylenol.</p>
<p>"'K," Sam did as she was told. Brooke spooned in behind her, put the compress on Sam's forehead and looped one arm around Sam's waist, resting her hand on the brunette's upset stomach. She started to gently rub Sam's stomach in soothing circles, hoping to calm and ease the pain Sam was experiencing.</p>
<p>"If you're not feeling better in a day or so, Sammy, we're calling the doctor. I don't want you developing an ulcer, OK?" Brooke said gently, nuzzling Sam's ear and kissing her neck softly. She felt Sam nod.</p>
<p>"'K," Sam mumbled sleepily as she started to dose off again. "'M glad things with Josh went well."</p>
<p>"So am I, Sammy. He's a sweetheart but not so swift. I said some things that only the 'old' Brooke would know and he never noticed," Brooke laughed slightly. </p>
<p>"Yup, that's Josh," Sam agreed, her voice whisper soft.</p>
<p>"Oh well, get some rest, Sam," she kissed Sam's cheek. "You'll feel better later."</p>
