<!-- No Regrets \ Dark Corners -->

<p>It was at night that the all-encompassing, suffocating personal darkness really got to her. During the day, there was enough miscellaneous background noise to distract her, for her to filter through to make her sort of forget about the nighttime. But at night, with only the muted beeps and hushed hallways of the hospital for company, Sam felt truly alone. Even the gentle reassuring sound of Brooke's sleep laden breathing from the bed next to hers did nothing to soothe Sam's terror.</p>
<p>Every unidentifiable tick, squeak, bang, bump, creak, and thump was another twisted horror her overly active imagination and over-stressed mind could come up with. To her, it felt like the walls were creeping in on her, closing in and cutting her off from the outside world. It was the purest form of fear. It made her heart race and her throat close as flashes of adrenaline sporadically flooded her system, sometimes set off by nothing more than a nurse making her rounds. That fear, coupled with the way her body ached beyond what the medicine could touch left Sam feeling fragile and isolated.</p>
<p>She lay huddled in her hospital bed, small whimpers unknowingly escaping from her lips from time to time. She could feel the tears burning her cheeks but sort of missed the way they used to blur her vision.</p>
<p>`I'd be happy with even that,' she thought sadly.</p>
<p>"Sammy? Are you OK?" Brooke asked sleepily. She was finely attuned to Sam and her emotions; therefore the brunette's soft whimpers had woken her quickly. </p>
<p>Sam jumped at the unexpected voice and then gasped at the pain the quick action caused. She also silently cursed at her inability to watch Brooke as they spoke. She missed just looking at Brooke's beautiful features. </p>
<p>"I'm scared, Brooke," she admitted in a whimper. Brooke got up and switched beds, gathering a trembling Sam into her arms.</p>
<p>"Of what, baby?" she asked gently as she ran her fingers through Sam's short but all ready unruly hair. Sam snuggled into the blonde but continued to shake.</p>
<p>"Promise not to laugh?" she said seriously. The thought of looking stupid to Brooke was seemingly unbearable in Sam's mind.</p>
<p>`And it's such a little thing to be afraid of too', she lamented. </p>
<p>"Of course I won't laugh, Sammy," Brooke reassured her. "Why would I laugh because you're scared?" Sam shrugged.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid of?the dark," she whispered pitifully, feeling small and alone. Brooke's heart broke at the lost and vulnerable tone of Sam's voice as well as the knowledge that there was nothing that she could do to really help.</p>
<p>"I know, Sammy," she hugged her precious brunette tightly but was mindful of the still painful injuries. "I know you can't see it but, would it help if I turned on the light? Would it help to at least KNOW that the light is on?" she offered. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, I guess not. It's not like I can see it," she sighed. She felt the gentle press of Brooke's lips against her temple and it eased her discomfort somewhat.</p>
<p>"Besides, Brooke, it'll just keep you awake. At least one of us should try and get some sleep," she added.</p>
<p>"Sammy, you need your sleep as much I do, if not more. You need it to heal," Brooke pointed out. Sam sighed again, heavier this time.</p>
<p>"I know but between the dark, the nightmares, and the pain, I can't relax," she explained softly. She hated admitting that she was still in pain. It made her feel weak and on top of that, she knew that it was tough on Brooke.</p>
<p>Sam was well aware of how her condition weighed on Brooke's mind. The blonde had witnessed the `accident' first hand, held her broken body that night in the street, and sat dutifully by her side while she struggled to wake up. All that plus the knowledge that Nicole's true target was Brooke herself gnawed at the taller girl and Sam didn't need her eyesight to be aware of it. The guilt was sometimes so palpable in Brooke's voice that Sam choked on it.</p>
<p>"Do you want to buzz the nurse for more medication?" Brooke wondered.</p>
<p>"No, I'm OK. It's more of an annoyance than real pain anyway," Sam clarified. She inhaled deeply, catching the smell of the sterile hospital but under that she caught Brooke's scent. It was very subtle under the antiseptic hospital smell, soap, and her shampoo. But it was warm and comforting. It was Brooke and it made Sam feel safe.</p>
<p>She breathed in again, trying to capture more of the fragrance and felt a rumble of laughter shake Brooke's lean frame.</p>
<p>"What? Why are you laughing?" she asked, genuinely curious.</p>
<p>"You were sniffing me again," Brooke giggled. "You've been doing it a lot lately. Makes me glad that I shower as much as I do or I'd be afraid that I smelled bad." Sam laughed with her.</p>
<p>"You smell good," she said as a way of explanation. "You smell warm and safe and snuggly. And sometimes, usually when I'm half-asleep and drifting, I imagine myself that night, being held in your arms. I remember that I fell asleep with my head on your shoulder and an arm and leg draped over you. And your arms were around me. I'd never felt so comfortable, or loved before in my life."</p>
<p>Brooke wished for the life of her that Sam could see the wide grin her words had caused as well as the happy tears. She reached over and traced Sam's full lips with her fingertips watching as Sam kissed them in response. She then leaned down and kissed Sam passionately.</p>
<p>"Tears?" Sam licked the salt off her lips after they parted. "Why are you crying?"</p>
<p>"Because I love you and am SO thankful to still have you," Brooke replied honestly.</p>
<p>"Oh," was all Sam said as she was overtaken by a huge yawn that she tried valiantly to hide. Brooke thought the display was cute.</p>
<p>"Think you can sleep now?" Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"If you stay here with me, yeah, I think so," she answered. Brooke pulled the blankets up over them both and cuddled down in the bed with Sam but not before turning on one of the small overhead lights.</p>
<p>"Just so you know it's there, Sam. It's not dark," she whispered into the drowsy girl's ear. Sam smiled lopsidedly. </p>
<p>"Thanks Brooke."</p>
<p align="center">**</p>
<p>"I had some people who specialize in this sort of thing come in and map the house," Jane explained hastily. "You have to memorize this packet, Sam." She went to hand Sam the folder before she remembered that Sam couldn't see her holding it out and instead dropped it into the teen's lap with an impatient huff.</p>
<p>"Memorize it?" Sam echoed bewildered. Jane nodded, heedless of the fact that Sam couldn't see it.</p>
<p>"They mapped out how many steps in between rooms and the furniture, etc. The faster you memorize it, the quicker you can adjust to living at home and don't have to be watched all the time."</p>
<p>Sam frowned as she ran her hands over the smooth paper before sighing in frustration. She wished Brooke hadn't chosen a little earlier to go down the hall to take a shower. </p>
<p>"Fine, right after I learn Braille. Oh wait, it's not written in Braille, is it?" she asked sarcastically. "Mom, how exactly do you expect me to READ this?"</p>
<p>"Don't use that tone with me, Samantha," Jane warned in a tone that Sam remembered none too fondly. "Have Brooke read it to you or something. She spends enough time in here with you, have her do something useful. I don't care how you do it, but learn it."</p>
<p>"Mom," Sam started, drawing the name out as she tried to get her own temper in check. Setting off her mother's temper would only make things worse and Sam knew it. "You're being unreasonable."</p>
<p>"No, Sam. `Unreasonable' is thinking that we're going to provide 24 hour, 7 day a week nursing service for you because you're too lazy to learn how to take care of yourself," Jane snapped. "'Unreasonable' is expecting me to wait on you hand and foot while I have a baby to take care of AND a job that requires my attention."</p>
<p>"I never asked you to do that!" Sam shot back, annoyed. "As a matter of fact, I haven't asked anything of you."</p>
<p>"Good. Because like I told you when your father died, you're on your own, Samantha. He babied you, coddled you and I hated it. Every time you got into trouble, there came your father, riding in to save you like your own private knight in shining armor. Well, he's gone now, Sam. You got yourself into this God-awful mess, YOU get yourself out of it because I sure as Hell am not helping you."</p>
<p>"Like I said, I didn't ask you to," Sam growled. God, she hated it when her mother got like this. It'd been years since Jane had last behaved this way and Sam had hoped that that time was the last but apparently she had been wrong.</p>
<p>"Aside from things like the maps, YOU figure out what the Hell you're going to do. The maps help me get you out of my hair, Sam. That's why I had them done. To help me. You're nothing but a pain in my ass. A BLIND pain in my ass now," Jane muttered, disgustedly.</p>
<p>"I don't suppose you could, oh, LEAVE now, could you?" Sam asked, her voice dripping with sarcasm and disdain. "My self-esteem has taken about all the abuse it can today but if you'd like to come back tomorrow and beat me some more, I think I can fit you in around 2." Jane rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"You think you're so witty and clever, Sam. But really you're just a pathetic little miscreant," she accused.</p>
<p>"Big word, Mom. Did you hurt yourself?" Sam mocked. Not being able to see the blow coming, the slap startled Sam more than it hurt. </p>
<p>"I think you'd better leave, Jane," Brooke hissed. She'd been standing outside the door for a few minutes, quietly listening in to see where Jane's mind was in all this. She'd started in the room somewhere around `blind pain in the ass' but wasn't fast enough to stop Jane from slapping Sam. And Brooke was so angry she was literally seeing red.</p>
<p>Jane glared at Brooke and they stared at each other hotly as Sam rubbed her cheek absently from the bed, unaware their ocular battle.</p>
<p>"Well, Sam, I see you DO have someone else to fight your battles like your father used to," Jane said snidely. Brooke pointed to the door.</p>
<p>"I don't care if you ARE her mother, you've overstayed your welcome and if you EVER hit her again I'll make sure you never come near her again, now GO!" Brooke growled dangerously. </p>
<p>"Sam, memorize those maps," Jane ordered. "See you at home, Brooke." </p>
<p>Brooke took a few cleansing breaths after Jane left and then sat on the bed and checked the red mark on the side of Sam's face. She was startled when Sam flinched.</p>
<p>"Sam?" </p>
<p>"Sorry, couldn't see for sure it was you," Sam said softly. "Plus I'm a little jumpy right now."</p>
<p>"I know, baby, I'm sorry," Brooke soothed as she caressed the harassed cheek. "God, Sam, was that really Jane?" Sam nodded sadly.</p>
<p>"Yeah, she?gets like that when she's REALLY stressed. This has to be hard on her," Sam defended her mother, albeit somewhat half-heartedly. The look on Brooke's face was incredulous although Sam couldn't see it.</p>
<p>"Hard on her? What about you? Sam, YOU'RE the one who's hurt, not her. And at any rate, she has no right to hit you," Brooke countered. "Has she?shit, Sam, has she ever hit you before? And what was all that about your Dad?"</p>
<p>Sam sighed. This was a story she never wanted to have to tell Brooke. Jane McPherson was by nature a nice woman, it was just that she could not handle stressful situations well. Or her jealous streak. And at the moment, both were being irritated in the woman.</p>
<p>Sam rubbed the bridge of her nose with her fingertips.</p>
<p>"Yeah, once or twice after my Dad died," she confessed reluctantly. She missed the look of pure rage that flashed across Brooke's face only to be replaced with one of pure love and compassion for her.</p>
<p>"As for my Dad?Brooke, do you remember how he died?" Brooke nodded out of habit and then mentally kicked herself.</p>
<p>"Uhm, car accident, right?" she asked although she was pretty sure. Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, like the irony?" she asked without a hint of humor. "Anyway, his car hit a tree in the rain. He shouldn't have even been out driving in that shit but, because of me, he was. I guess Mom still kind of blames me."</p>
<p>"She shouldn't, Sam. It was an accident," Brooke reasoned. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"Not from her point of view. He was out in the storm doing something for ME so it's MY fault."</p>
<p>"No, Sam, it's STILL an accident. You got hit saving me. I was supposed to be the one hurt. Does that make this?my fault?" Brooke's voice had faded to a fearful whisper. Sam felt around and wrapped her arms around Brooke's waist in a fierce hug.</p>
<p>"No, never," she said firmly.</p>
<p>"But?by your logic?" Brooke started.</p>
<p>"Shush, don't use my logic against me," Sam smiled. Brooke immediately felt better. Sam's smiles always did that for her. The fear that Sam in some way blamed her for the whole incident was a huge burden for her. Knowing that she didn't was a great relief.</p>
<p>"So, why was your dad out that night?" Brooke asked softly. Sam rested her head against Brooke's chest and listened to the blonde's steady heartbeat.</p>
<p>"I had a project for school that I'd forgotten to do, in my normal `Sam procrastination'," she chuckled. "Mom wanted me to get an `F' and learn not to put things off until the last minute but Dad didn't. He always wanted me to do good in school and understood that sometimes I didn't mean to forget, I just did. But I didn't have the construction paper and glue for the job. It was storming real bad but he said he'd go get it and pick up dinner too. He was on his way home from getting dinner after getting the supplies when he hydroplaned into the tree."</p>
<p>"Awww, Sammy," Brooke sighed in sympathy.</p>
<p>"That first night was the worst with my Mom. I don't know if she didn't realize what she was doing but?yeah it was bad."</p>
<p>Rage poured through Brooke as the images of a young, grief-stricken Sam being beaten and screamed at by her mother streamed through her mind. She wanted to repay every wound, every injury but knew it was a fruitless fantasy. This woman was her stepmother, after all.</p>
<p>"You're awful tense, Brooke, please don't let this upset you," Sam asked as she snuggled closer and started to drift off, the emotional cost of the afternoon taking it's toll. But she could feel the ripples of tension throughout the muscles in Brooke's body and the thought of having upset her made Sam unhappy.</p>
<p>"It does upset me, Sammy. And I'm going to have a long talk with my Dad," Sam opened her mouth to protest but Brooke silenced her with a gentle kiss.</p>
<p>"But for now, I think I'll just take a nap with you. Is that OK?" Sam smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>"That'd be lovely," she agreed.</p>
<p>"And Jane can't visit unless I'm in here too," Brooke amended.</p>
<p>"You'll get no argument from me," Sam agreed happily. She didn't want to spend time alone with her mother again anymore than Brooke wanted her to.</p>
