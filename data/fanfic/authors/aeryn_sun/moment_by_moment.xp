<chapter title="1.Awakening">
<p>I don't know why I didn't see it coming.</p>

<p>I should have known that she was going to leave her chewed up
and spat out on the side of the road like so many other pieces of
road-kill left in her self-important, arrogant wake. But I didn't
want to see that possibility. I just wanted to see them both happy.</p>

<p>I should have known that with a harpy like Nicole
Julian, `happy' is a four-letter word.</p>

<p>Now she's all messed up and it's all Nic's fault and what
really gets me is that Nicole doesn't even care. She's PROUD of the
number she's done on her. Proud of the destruction and pain she's
wreaked. Like it was some sort of some sick contest to see who could
break her first. And damn her, Nicole just HAD to win.</p>

<p>Poor Sam. She's the one suffering in all this.</p>

<p>I barely see much of her anymore. She hardly ever comes out
of her room, even to eat dinner with me and the parentals. She only
goes to school because Mom forces her to, but I know it's hard for
Sam to face her tormentor day in and day out. Knowing that Nicole
mocks her not only behind her back but to her face as well has got to
be killing Sam, being as strong and proud as she is.</p>

<p>I've tried to reach out to her, get her to talk to me about
what's going on in that beautiful head of hers, behind the pain so
clearly etched in those deep brown eyes but, apparently I'm guilty by
association. Because Nicole was my friend, my `responsibility', this
whole mess is somewhat my fault as well. Even despite the fact that
I've publicly spurned Nicole and her friendship, Sam directs some of
her anger at me.</p>

<p>And that hurts…more than I dare let on.</p>

<p>God, I feel like I'm getting ahead of myself. Maybe I should
backtrack to when this all started to go to Hell on the express train.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Sam, beautiful sweet Sam dropped the bombshell on the family
one night at dinner. Granted, her `coming out' wasn't THAT huge a
shock to me. After all, I am her age, live across a bathroom with
her, go to the same school and basically can't avoid her even if I
wanted to. Which, by the way, in case you miss the obvious, I
don't. I have been acutely aware of all things `Sam' for some time
now. Her smile, her eyes (specifically the way they light up when
she's happy), her scent (slightly vanilla with a hint of something
unique), her curves, her…everything; are ingrained into my brain like
a much needed pattern. Her presence comforts me in some integral
way. Like, I didn't know that she was missing from my life until she
was in it.</p>

<p>Am I making ANY sense here? Doubtfully. Then again, I'm
blonde so I'm allowed pseudo-deep moments like these.</p>

<p>Anyway, Sam announced that she was gay, which to me was fine
although I'd been sitting on my bisexuality for a while. I saw no
reason to further rock the boat at that moment in time. My Dad
seemed to take it better than Mom did though. Jane looked like she
might be having difficulty breathing so we had to check on her. She
was OK, just in shock. I guess she'd never noticed anything amiss in
Sam's life that would have given her any indication. It's somewhat
disturbing that my father was more observant towards this than she
was. I mean, we're talking about a teenage girl whose bedroom walls
are covered with women, mostly. Melissa Etheridge, Selma Blair,
Catherine Zeta-Jones, Jodie Foster, Claudia Black, Gillian Anderson,
Brooke Burke, Shania Twain, Xena…Hello? Reality check, Mom. The
only non-female posters on Sam's walls had to do with Radiohead and
Dashboard Confessional.</p>

<p>Even I'm more subtle than Sam. (If you overlook that giant
Bring it On poster over my bed…*cough*)</p>

<p>There were some tears shed and then Jane went to bed early.
Sam looked a little lost but I assured her that Mom'd be OK in the
morning. She seemed to feel better after that. We talked for a long
time that night and I fell asleep in Sam's room, along side her on
the bed. I'm not ashamed or embarrassed to say it was one of the
best night's sleep I'd had in a long time. And it let Sam know that
our recent bonding as step-sisters to be wasn't at all affected by
her announcement.</p>

<p>In fact, I was feeling hopeful.</p>

<p>Maybe it was wrong of me but I was kind of hoping to slowly
approach Sam about the way I felt for her. Test the waters as it
were. Only, she jumped in with both feet and I ended up alone in the
boat.</p>

<p>I swear, Nicole made a beeline for Sam like a lion going for
a steak dipped in A1 sauce the second Sam told her friends at school
and word got out about her sexuality. I'd known about Nicole's
somewhat casual sexuality for a while, having pretty much had to beat
her off with my pom poms on more than one occasion. She's not so
much bisexual as `all' sexual. (Trust me, there's a difference) `If
it looks good and feels good, do it', is her personal motto. And
let's face it, Sam LOOKS good. No doubt about that.</p>

<p>So, she made a beeline for Sam. Do not pass `go'; do not
collect $200. She made no stops in between. Honest, I've never seen
Nic move that fast unless it's at a half-off sale at Prada. But
Sam's no fool. She didn't just buy into Nicole's act. Nic had to
fight to get her attention. Beg forgiveness, buy her things,
apologize in public to Lily, Carmen, and Harrison for the things
she'd done. Sam put her through the wringer before date 1. I wasn't
even sure that Sam as ever even going to go out with Nicole. I
prayed that she wouldn't but…she caved. Of course, I think after 2
months of constantly being inundated by someone I'd cave too. Or
call the police to report a stalker.</p>

<p>It was so sweet. Sam actually asked MY permission to date
Nicole. </p>

<p>"She's your friend first and if it's going to make things awkward for
you, or us then I'd rather not," she'd said. And I know that if I'd
asked her not to, she would have said `no' to Nicole.</p>

<p>But damn me and my concern for Sam's happiness instead of my
own.</p>

<p>"What do you want, Sam?" I'd asked her. She'd smiled shyly
and blushed. It was heartbreakingly adorable.</p>

<p>"To try. I kinda wanna see what happens. Nicole seems so
different," she sighed. And I gave her my `permission' to try to
find her own happiness. It won me a huge hug at the time but in
hindsight I should have KNOWN Nicole was going to rip her to shreds
like the aforementioned lion and steak.</p>

<p>They started dating and at first it seemed all right.
Granted, I was unhappy but Sam seemed genuinely pleased with her
relationship. Nicole seemed almost bearable in her bitchiness and
things settled into a somewhat livable pattern. Nicole would pick
Sam up for a date; I'd sit at home and worry and wonder until Sam got
home; then Sam would tell me all the (slightly) edited details until
we fell asleep. We were spending a lot more time in each other's
rooms and lives now that she was dating Nicole. She'd be at
cheerleading practice, which I liked and sometimes, when I figured no
one was paying attention, I'd show off for her.</p>

<p>But someone was noticing and Nicole was pissed. She knew
about my sexuality and was determined to get the `better' of me where
Sam was concerned. I don't know if it was her plan all along but if
I ever find out the truth I swear to God, I will rip her face off.</p>

<p>Sam suddenly started pulling away from me slightly and I knew
Nicole was the reason why. Plus, Sam can't seem to lie very well to
me anymore so when I asked her, she confessed that Nicole was jealous
of our relationship. I tried to get across to Sam that she could
have both, her friendship with me and her relationship with Nicole
but Nicole was pulling her in the opposite direction. She didn't
know what end was up. I saw that it was getting harder and harder
for her to figure out so I pulled back a bit to give her some room.
And that was my biggest mistake. It left Sam too open and vulnerable
and Nicole moved in for the kill.</p>

<p>Ever notice how most of my `Nicole analogies' are animal
based? I bet you a year's allowance her birth family were barracudas.</p>

<p>Anyway, to my great horror, she took Sam on a weekend trip.
The longest weekend of my life and one I will always regret. I knew
what Nicole's plans were and I tried to warn Sam. Sam's always been…skittish about sex. It really means something to her to lose her
virginity to someone that means a lot to her. And I knew that Nicole
was NOT that someone. I begged her to carefully consider any
decisions that she would be making over the weekend and she promised
me she would. When she walked through that door Sunday night, I knew
Nicole had gotten what she wanted. And I knew Sam hadn't. I just
wondered what Nicole was going to do next.</p>
</chapter>

<chapter title="2. The Fall">
<p>I should have been better prepared.</p>
<p>Granted, in my own defense, even in my worst nightmares I
couldn't have seen what was coming but, damn it, I should have known
Nicole was up to SOMETHING. She'd had that maniacal gleam in her
eyes all freaking day and it was making my skin crawl.</p>
<p>Note to self: never keep a best friend who reminds you of a
serial killer on acid.</p>
<p>In front of a cafeteria full of onlookers, at the height of
the lunch rush, Nicole blew Sam out of the water.</p>
<p>"I've got sad news for you, Spam," she sneered and my heart
dropped. I wanted desperately to stop Nicole from talking but was
too far away. All I could do was listen in the same sense of fear
and dread as I imagine Sam was.</p>
<p>"You mean nothing to me. You were just a challenge, a game
to play. You were a fun fuck, hon. And not a very good one at that,"
Nicole laughed as snickers started to rumble through the room. "I've
had better. Honestly, I've done better solo with just these," she
flashed her expensively manicured fingers at Sam who was by now
painfully red in the face.</p>
<p>I just wanted to rush over and envelop her in my arms and
protect her from the pain Nicole was gleefully inflicting. Keep the
evil words from ever reaching those delicate ears. Or perhaps bash
Nicole over the head with a lunch tray, whichever was more
convenient. But I'm struck at that moment by my absolute
powerlessness. And I think that hurts almost more than anything else.</p>
<p>"But…" Sam managed to choke out, stunned as she was by
Nicole's admission. Nicole, who I truly believe now to be some sort
of Satan spawn, simply waved her off with one hand.</p>
<p>"You're not listening, McQueerson," she snickered at her own
bad joke. "I PLAYED you and you fell for it. You're so desperate for
any sort of affection that you jumped at the chance to be with
someone, anyone even if it was someone who used to be your worst
enemy. I fucked you over royally, kid. Figuratively and literally.
Welcome to the real world." Nicole smiled a sick, cruel smile then
and leaned in closer to poor stunned Sammy.</p>
<p>"How does it feel to know that the first person to ever touch
you, make you pant and moan, HATED you from the get go? USED you for
amusement and a quick fuck? It was all a game, Sam. And you lose."</p>
<p>Sammy, proud, stubborn Sam who was red in the face and
mortified, refused to let Nicole see how badly she was hurt by those
words. The tears threatened to fall but only hovered at the edge of
her dark lashes as she looked at Nicole in both utter hurt and
complete rage. Then, without a sound, Sam fled the room with one
hand over her mouth, trying not to be sick in front of the school's
populace as the words struck home.</p>
<p>I was sick too as Nicole laughed, I mean LAUGHED at Sam's
retreating form. She had truly amused herself with her little game.</p>
<p>"Run, Sammy!" she called mockingly after Sam. "See how far
you have to run to find your self-worth!" she giggled. She then
looked at her audience, still watching her with rapt attention.</p>
<p>"Now that, boys and girls, was more than worth the work it
took me to get her," she smirked, making my stomach flip-flop even
more.</p>
<p>"Why?" I heard myself ask. Nicole spun on me like a dervish
on crack.</p>
<p>"Ah, Brookie, to teach the little freak a lesson," she said
simply. "Don't you get it?" At my numb shake of the head, Nicole
sighed.</p>
<p>"Sometimes, B, you're as clueless as she is," she accused. I
felt my anger overtaking my shock. "First off, she needed to learn
her place in the scheme of things. She will ALWAYS be less than us,
Brooke. She needs to know that. WE can have her or make her do
whatever WE want whenever we want because of WHO we are." </p>
<p>Is it just me or was Nicole coming across as insane?</p>
<p>"And second, I'm not blind, hon. Sam is fiiiine. I wanted a piece of
that so I got it. I saw something I wanted and I took it."</p>
<p>She was making her sound like a sweater on sale at Saks.</p>
<p>"First taste too, lucky me," she licked her fingers in a grotesque
fashion to illustrate her point. </p>
<p>My fist connected with Nicole's face before I knew I'd thrown the
punch. My next two punches were hard hits to her body as she doubled
over. I later lied and said I didn't remember doing it, but I did.
Clearly.</p>
<p>This may sound sick, but it was a delicious feeling to inflict that
pain on her like that, in front of a room full of our peers. A tit
for a tat, I guess. </p>
<p>I saw her lying there, the room shock silent and still and I was
proud. I defended Sammy in some way when she couldn't do so for
herself. It's one of my proudest moments.</p>
<p>"Bitch," came out of my mouth in more of a growl than any
recognizable form of my voice. "You did that to get at ME and we both
know it." Nicole smiled through her bloody nose and STILL managed to
look superior. Smug bitch.</p>
<p>"Hell yeah," she wheezed. "I win."</p>
<p>My rage was hot and red and I swear I wanted to kill her. If not for
the 300 plus witnesses, I might have. Instead, I gave her one last
heartfelt kick and ran after Sammy.</p>
<p>It wasn't hard to find her, following her sobs down the hall into the
Novak. They were more wails than sobs, really. Banshee wails that
still haunt me now, a few weeks later. I've never heard such cries
of suffering coming from anyone in my life. I pray to never hear
them again, especially from Sam.</p>
<p>"Sam, are you all right?" I asked softly. I knew it was a stupid
question the second it left my lips. </p>
<p>She looked up at me from her place on the floor in front of
one of the toilets, flushing the evidence that she'd been physically
ill from sight and glaring at me. Her eyes red and puffy, tears
streaming down her face in rivers and soaking her shirt collar as
they ran down her neck. Those deep brown pools, so often in the
recent past lit up in mischief and delight were now a picture of open
devastation and raw anger. It blew me back a few steps.</p>
<p>"Am I all right? Are you fucking insane, Brooke?" she
screeched, her voice raw and scratchy from crying.</p>
<p>"Sam, I…I…"</p>
<p>What does one say to that?</p>
<p>Ever notice my habit of stammering when I could REALLY use my
verbal skills? Some captain of the debate team I am.</p>
<p>She stood up and started to pace wildly, making me nervous in
her excited energy.</p>
<p>"A `fun fuck'? A FUN FUCK! She USED ME! TOOK what she
wanted and now I'm yesterday's news. To hell with anything I might
feel. She never felt shit. Just strung me along until she could get
into my pants and now, `see ya later, Sam'." I let her rant, hoping
it would help.</p>
<p>She paced around the room, finally stopping at the mirror
where she stared at herself for several long awkward minutes. I
didn't know what to say. Plus I knew anything I could say would only
set her off again. So I watched her stare at herself with such a
powerful look of self-loathing that it broke my heart. She hated
herself in that moment and that's something I never wanted Sammy to
feel. I'm familiar with that place and I don't want Sam knowing that
darkness.</p>
<p>"I let her," she whispered, hanging her head. "I GAVE it to
her…" She looked back at her reflection; the red eyes, the wild hair,
the look of absolute defeat looking back at her.</p>
<p>"I didn't want to…but I LET HER!" She punched at the mirror,
shattering it into millions of pieces, making me jump, and splitting
open her hand.</p>
<p>"Aw, Sammy…" I sighed, hating to see her in more pain. </p>
<p>She suddenly turned to face me and I swear her eyes almost
seemed to glow red.</p>
<p>"I bet you were in on the whole fucking thing," she hissed
and my stomach clenched as I realized she was going to blame me. I
had given her my `permission' to date Nicole. That was bound to make
me look guilty.</p>
<p>"Sam, no, I…"</p>
<p>"LIAR!" she screamed, making me flinch and cower somewhat.
Being the sole recipient of that much rage is frightening. This was
not my sweet Sammy and I couldn't blame her in the slightest.</p>
<p>"You helped put her up to this. All you've ever cared about
is making sure that `I got mine'. Well, I hope you're happy,
McQueen. I'm broken. Game over, you win."</p>
<p>"Sam…" I tried to protest. She let out a short bark of a
laugh that sent chills down my spine.</p>
<p>"All that time…all those talks with me. I thought we had
gotten closer. I thought we HAD something really special, Brooke. I
thought maybe, if this didn't work…maybe you…aw shit…you PLAYED me
better than SHE did. Fucker! I HATE YOU!" She shoved me roughly
into the door of a nearby stall, bruising my back. The grip she had
on my upper arms was painful but I knew that it wasn't Sam reacting
this way. It was what Nicole had done to her. </p>
<p>I didn't fight back, willing somewhat to take whatever punishment she
wanted to dish out if it made her feel better. But she only stared
at me intensely for a few minutes. I could feel the blood from her
cuts seeping through my shirt and I wanted to help her but I daren't
speak. Then she released me with a growl, jerked open the door and
fled faster than I could follow. Besides, my feet were rooted to the
floor by shock and my own pain.</p>
</chapter>

<chapter title="3. Realization">
<p>And that, is the day that my life fell apart.</p>
<p>I lost Sam. That's the most important thing. She can't
tolerate my presence.</p>
<p>But along with that, my popularity has suffered because
Nicole has warred a smear campaign against me, using my somewhat
ambiguous sexuality status against me. And honestly, I wouldn't give
a rat's ass about all that, if she wasn't still using Sam as a weapon.</p>
<p>You see, since my defense of Sam that day, rumors have
started (begun, no doubt by none other than Ms Julian) that there was
something going on between Sam and I. Nicole has spread this tale
that she found out about it and THAT'S why she did what she did to
Sam. Now Sam and I are looking like the bad guys, the adulterer and
the seductress, as it were, and Nicole is somehow ending up looking
like the wronged victim. Doesn't help that I got a 3-day suspension
and a stint in therapy for my `violent outburst'. Fuck `violent
outburst'; bitch is lucky I didn't have a sharp object. Let me SHOW
you `violent outburst'.</p>
<p>Did I take those stupid meds this morning?</p>
<p>Sam's friends have been no help. Remind me NOT to call them
in a crisis. Lily's off crusading to save whatever pathetic little
forest animal she thinks needs saving this week while Josh, driftwood
Josh, follows her around like a demented puppy. (Did he follow ME
like that? Scary) Carmen is busy obsessing about…something. Whether
it's about if people think SHE'S gay, or her weight, cheerleading, or
her mother or whatnot, she hasn't been there for Sam. And Harrison?
What an ass. He gives new meaning to the words `idiot homophobe'.
With Sam and Nicole `out', he was getting antsy, given that he was
still having issues about his mother being a lesbian. Now that
questions are floating around about MY sexuality, he's carrying
around Lysol and plastic gloves, apparently afraid of `gay germs' or
something as equally insane and impossible. </p>
<p>Sometimes I think that boy is a few french fries short of a
Happy Meal.</p>
<p>A few tacos short of a combo plate?</p>
<p>Oh, I'm wandering.</p>
<p>Anyway, naturally, the parentals found out about EVERYTHING.
And yes, somehow it still managed to be MY fault because I should
have `kept a better reign' on Nicole. You know, I feel guilty enough
over what happened but does the girl LOOK like a Clydesdale to you?
I don't need any more guilt. I have enough of my own.</p>
<p>But I've gotten off track, this is about Sam.</p>
<p>Her hand needed stitches and stubborn ass that she is, she
refused to go see a doctor for so long that it got infected. She was
kind of sick for a bit and COULDN'T go to school. Now she WON'T go.</p>
<p>She's a hermit now. Barely speaks to anyone, let alone me. She
dropped out of the school newspaper, left the track team, and never
hangs out with her friends. It's like she lost faith in EVERYONE
because of this. She doesn't even play with little Mackenzie and
that's just sad because Mac's just a baby. She has no malicious
intent towards Sam. Hell, the words `malicious intent' only sound
like gobbalty gook to the tyke. She only knows that Sam's her sister
and that she loves her and wants to play with her. But Sam hardly
leaves her room. It's a fight to get her to leave her room every
morning to go to school. She barely eats and when she does, it's not
at dinner with us. I should say, `not at dinner with me' because I'm
the one she's obviously avoiding.</p>
<p>She's gotten rail thin and she was small to start with. Of
anyone, I think I should know what's dangerous when it comes to
weight and she's starting to wander into that area. Her face is too
thin; her cheekbones jut out at odd angles; there are deep wells of
dark purple and grey under her eyes. Her hair, that I usually would
have called luxurious and gleaming is dull and kind of ratty
looking. In a word, she looks like shit.</p>
<p>Every time I approach her, to apologize, to talk or whatever,
the outburst I get from her gets increasingly loud and nearly
violent. Nicole really did a number on her and I don't know how to
reach her. </p>
<p>And yet, despite my repeated failures…I can't stop trying.</p>
</chapter>

<chapter title="4. The Battle">
<p>She's had the same song on repeat on her CD player for the
past hour and a half. It's a good song, `Bother' by Corey Taylor
from the `Spider-Man' soundtrack. But honestly, ninety minutes of it
is enough to drive even a saint to pull out their hair and hit
themselves over the head with a rubber mallet.</p>
<p>Bracing myself for yet another fight, I walk across our
shared bathroom and try her door. To my utter surprise, it's
unlocked. That's odd, given her perpetual hatred of me. She hasn't
let me NEAR her room in ages. She must have recently taken a shower
and forgot to lock it. </p>
<p>I knock, loudly as to be heard over the music, before I open the door.</p>
<p>Sam's a mess and her room reflects that fact. Her posters
are in shreds, some still hanging by little pieces of Scotch tape on
the walls. Her corkboard is a disturbing collage of pictures of
Nicole, all skewered with tacks and covered in red ink. Actually, it
gives me a perverse sense of joy to see her taking her anger out on
the true source of her anguish, however vicariously.</p>
<p>"Go away, bitch," she hisses at me from her desk where she's
drafting what is no doubt yet another scathing letter to Nicole. A
letter that Nicole will photocopy and post throughout the school to
further mock poor Sam. It's sick, really; the way Nicole gets off on
hurting Sam the way she does. </p>
<p>I turn off the CD player and lean against the wall, taking a
relaxed stance rather than my usual `begging for forgiveness for
something I didn't do' posture. I feel like a change is needed.</p>
<p>"I have a name you know," I say calmly. "And oddly enough, it
isn't `bitch'." She snorts at me.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well mine's not `dyke', `carpet-muncher', `cunt', `whore', `lesbo', `muff-diver', or `pussy-licker'
either. But no one seems to remember that," she points out
bitterly. And that's just a small sample of the names that have been
flying at her these past few weeks.</p>
<p>It's a strange duality. While she was dating Nicole, no one
cared what her sexuality was. Sure there was a small bit of `Oh my
God, did you hear?' that went around the school but it was considered
Sam and Nicole's business. Besides, this is California and if you
can honestly say you don't know at least one gay person, you
obviously JUST got here.</p>
<p>But now that Nicole's true motivation has been revealed and
she's done her spin control for herself and against Sam and I,
suddenly, Sam (and somewhat by extension me) is the absolute bane of
the existence of Kennedy High. Hell, I think April Tuna and Emory
Dick are more popular than Sam is right now. And that frightens me.</p>
<p>(The fact that I just used `April Tuna', `Emory Dick',
and `popular' in a positive sense, alarms me as well)</p>
<p>Then again, it occurs to me just now that this double
standard that works against Sam and I is probably the same double
standard that lets the guys check out each other's packages in the
locker room after football games and like, that's OK, because, guys
DO that.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>It's still unfair.</p>
<p>"Sam," I start patiently. "We really need to talk." Her
glare, somehow, gets impossibly hotter.</p>
<p>"What do you and I possibly have to talk about?" she sneers.
Her tone of voice is not unlike nails on a chalkboard to my ears and
makes me cringe. Sam's voice is usually so sweet and low. This one
just sucks.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know…how about how you helped Nicole use me?" she
suggests. Before I can interrupt to differ, she keeps going.</p>
<p>"You do realize, Brooke," she emphasizes my name in such a
way that I like the sound of `bitch' better. "That what she did to me
was one step away from rape?" God, just the sound of that word makes
me want to revisit the bacon and eggs I had for breakfast earlier.
Because I know in my heart that she's right.</p>
<p>"Sam, I don't know how to make you believe that I had nothing
to do with what Nicole did. I was just as shocked as you…" I try to
explain. She stands up to face me, anger pouring off her in almost
tangible waves.</p>
<p>"Why? Why were you shocked? Because she went behind your
back and beat you to it? She got to deflower me when that's what YOU
wanted? Damn, you're just making your way through our entire class,
aren't you? First Josh, then Harrison, then you aimed for me…"</p>
<p>"It's not like that," I say, hearing my voice raise a little
because she's hurting my feelings. She arches an eyebrow, looking
pleased with herself at hitting a nerve. She's hurting so badly that
she just wants to make everyone around her suffer as greatly. I
can't fault her for it.</p>
<p>"No? Come on, Brookie, I've heard the stories Nicole's
spreading around school. That trip to Tahiti with Nicole last
summer? That girl, what was her name…?" She's baiting me and damn me
I'm going to go for it.</p>
<p>"Inola," I supply, barely above a whisper. Sam nods, a
crooked smile marring her features.</p>
<p>"Inola. According to what I've heard, you had quite a time
with Inola," she smirks devilishly but it lacks her usual spirit.
It's cold and mean and turns my stomach. I nod because it's the
truth. Why lie to her now?</p>
<p>"Fheh," she snorts again. A very unladylike trait, I must
say but, I'm losing focus.</p>
<p>"So, what do you want, Brooke? You want a shot at me?" Her
words shock me back to fine clarity and I watch as she spreads her
arms open wide and flops down on the bed on her back. "Well, here you
go. I won't even make you fight as hard as Nicole had to for so
long. You want a `fun fuck'? Go ahead, just let me know when you're
done so I can finish my homework."</p>
<p>I'm at once shocked by her words and yet glad she's at least
talking to me, however ludicrous her dialogue may be.</p>
<p>"You're not ready to understand yet," I realize sadly. She
sighs heavily from the bed.</p>
<p>"Yeah, whatever," she scoffs. </p>
<p>Suddenly feeling brazen, I stalk to the bed and lean over her
body, pinning her down for a second. I don't know what's possessing
me to act like this and it may end up getting me into even more
trouble in the long run but screw it, what have I got left to lose?</p>
<p>My pride? Heh, that's long gone.</p>
<p>I kiss her, long and hard, hoping to convey my own hurt along
with my apology and sympathy and yes, love with it. She panics at
first, and fights against me, small frightened mewing sounds coming
from the back of her throat. I feel my tears coursing down my face
as I wonder exactly how far Nicole had to push to get what she
wanted. But then I feel her relax somewhat and it gives me hope.</p>
<p>We're both breathless when I pull away.</p>
<p>"Listen to me, Sam," I say, my voice steady and calm. Much
calmer than I feel right now. She nods at me as she stares into my
eyes. She still looks slightly frightened but there's a spark of
curiosity in those brown eyes that she can't hide.</p>
<p>"I would never, EVER hurt you the way Nicole has hurt you," I
say evenly. "I had no idea she was going to do such a horrible, mean
and heartless thing. If I did know, I would have done ANYTHING to
stop her. I swear that to you."</p>
<p>"If it had been me you slept with, lost your virginity to,
there would be no doubting how I truly felt for you. The love I feel
would have been evident and you would not regret a second of it. You
would NOT equate the experience to rape. And I would not have turned
on you the next morning. If I EVER have the privilege of making love
to you, it wouldn't be a `fun fuck'. It'd be love, Sammy. And I'd
want it to last forever. Do you understand me?"</p>
<p>She nods again and I release her, standing up to leave her
room. I leave her sitting stupefied on her bed. But I can't resist
one last parting shot.</p>
<p>"Think about that when you remember who broke Nicole's nose
after you ran away that day. Remember who it was that cracked one of
the girl's ribs and now goes to therapy for anger management. THEN
decide who the guilty parties are."</p>
<p>I barely get to my own room before my legs give out and my
heart hammers so hard I'm afraid of a heart attack at 17.</p>
<p>Did I really just do all that?</p>
<p>I basically just admitted to Sam that I love her. Oh God.</p>
<p>God, I hope I haven't made things worse.</p>
<p>Exhaustion claims me in seconds to a fitful slumber.</p>
</chapter>

<chapter title="5. Recovering">
<p>OK, she's staring at me like I'm a space alien. That can't
be a good sign.</p>
<p>I woke up this morning to find her staring at me from the
bathroom door. She'd obviously just gotten out of the shower
(thankfully, finally. Her hair was starting to look dread-locked)
She was wrapped in a towel, standing in my doorway looking at me with
keen interest. I think her gaze might be what woke me, I'm not sure,
but as soon as I opened my eyes, she ran back to her own room. It
was the strangest thing. But at least she wasn't standing over me
with a shovel. </p>
<p>That's me, always got to find that bright side of things.</p>
<p>Now I'm sitting on the couch, flipping through Saturday
afternoon TV (Jesus is there ANYTHING worth watching anymore) and
she's standing by the armchair watching me like I'm a rabid dog about
to attack.</p>
<p>OK, she's making me really nervous.</p>
<p>"Sit down, say something, or leave the room, Sam before you
drive me insane," I ask, making her jump slightly. She apparently
wasn't expecting me to speak. Arf arf. "Granted it's a short drive
but still, don't help."</p>
<p>She sits in the armchair as if on command, and it irks me
slightly but I don't say anything. She folds her legs up to her
chest and wraps her arms around them. She's effectively folded into
herself and makes a frighteningly small package now. She looks so
frail that it scares me.</p>
<p>"Why did you do it?" she asks in a small voice, her brown
eyes much too wide in her face as she watches me. I bite my lip and
decide to stall her.</p>
<p>"Do what, Sam? I've done so many questionable things
lately." Well, isn't THAT the truth?</p>
<p>"You have to narrow it down," I continue when she's just
patiently quiet. I'm still looking at the TV and wondering why we
bother paying for cable anymore.</p>
<p>"Are you referring to why I parked on the street? Why I
switched from Dove soap to Irish Spring? Why I voted for Nikki and
not Kelly on American Idol? Give me a hint here, Sam."</p>
<p>I have answers to all of those, by the way.</p>
<p>She clears her throat and shakes her head.</p>
<p>"Why did you attack Nicole?" she clarifies, her voice still
whisper soft. It's a nice change from the screaming growl I've been
subjected to lately. I shrug nonchalantly and feel a blush burn my
ears but don't really understand the reason for it.</p>
<p>"She deserved it," I say simply. God did she. Girlfriend
deserved being beaten like a redheaded stepchild on a family
holiday. Or at least hit with a large, heavy object repeatedly.</p>
<p>Heh, I know. I'll kill her and then have OJ go look for the
real killer. Ha ha, I amuse me.</p>
<p>"I thought you helped her," she says, hanging her head in
shame. Oh Sammy, don't take more blame in this. </p>
<p>I get up from the couch and kneel next to her chair, brushing
the hair away from her face. It's shiny and gleaming again, soft to
the touch.</p>
<p>"I'd never do anything like that, Sammy. But especially to
you," I say gently. I don't want to say too much and spook her. She
nods against my hand and sighs. </p>
<p>"I know…I'm sorry," she sniffs as I see a few tears fall past
her curtain of hair that's hiding her face from me. I lift her head
to face me and look her directly in the eyes. I know it's important
for her to understand what I'm about to say.</p>
<p>"There's nothing for you to be sorry for, Sam. Nicole hurt
you terribly and you reacted to that. I don't blame you at all so
don't blame yourself. Don't worry about it, I forgive you," I speak
slowly and calmly, ending my talk with a small smile. She collapses
into my arms, startling me but I wrap my arms around her and let her
cry.</p>
<p>"Thank you, I'm sorry…" she babbles. I pet her hair and rock
her slightly as she sobs loudly and uncontrollably.</p>
<p>"WHY?" she screeches. "She USED me? WHY? Why did she have
to hurt me like that?"</p>
<p>Sadly I have no answers for her. But thankfully she also
knows that. I'm only here to comfort her, not answer her soul's
questions right now.</p>
<p>Mom comes in from grocery shopping and passes us on the
living room floor, giving me a questioning look that I just wave off
over Sam's shoulder. Jane nods and heads into the kitchen assuming
that I have Sam under control. At least Sam's out of her room and
talking to me, I realize. That's a good start at least.</p>
<p>"Why, Brooke?" she continues, mumbling into my shirt which is
now soaked with her tears and pain. "I swear I never did anything to
her. What did I do to deserve what she did to me?" She looks up at
me with those eyes imploring me for an answer and I can't stay quiet
anymore. I have to try and piece my beloved Sammy back together.</p>
<p>"You didn't do anything, Sammy," I soothe, rubbing gentle
circles on the girl's back as she hiccups and still sobs in my arms.
She's quieter now though, having grown tired from all the emotional
turmoil. She's settled into my lap, almost like a child. It'd be
precious if she wasn't hurting so bad right now.</p>
<p>"Nicole," I start and stop to pick through my words
carefully. "Nicole is a cruel, heartless bitch." Yeah, that about
sums it up. "I don't know whether she went after you to get at me,
really, or if it was something else. Sam, let's be honest, you know
that I like you right?"</p>
<p>She looks at me, eyes impossibly wide but bright with
understanding and nods.</p>
<p>"Yeah," she sniffs. I look at her intently.</p>
<p>"I mean `like you' in a way that's likely to give your mother
a stroke and send my father to the funny farm `like', got that?" She
smiles slightly and nods again.</p>
<p>"Uh huh, got it," she whispers, staring suddenly at my lips.</p>
<p>Damn that's distracting.</p>
<p>"Uhm…" Oh, that was intelligent sounding, Brooke. Gah. "So,
anyway, Nicole kind of knew how I felt too. And I think that somehow
this might have been partially my fault because you KNOW how she has
some sort of pathological need to outdo me. And I'm afraid that you
became just something else to beat me at, Sammy. And I'm so very
sorry for that."</p>
<p>"Not your fault, Brooke," she sighs again and then rests her
head against my chest. It's kind of nice being able to be this close
and not worry about bodily harm. Now if I could just erase her pain
I'd accomplish all my life's work.</p>
<p>"Nicole…she…she…*groan*," Sam doesn't finish her sentence,
just buries her face deeper into my shirt as if trying to hide. I
think leaving it open makes me feel worse than if she HAD finished it.</p>
<p>"Sam, I hate to ask this but…I need to know," I feel the
words choking themselves out as I try not to be sick here on the
floor. And I wonder why the need to know is so strong. Perhaps to
finish off the last few remaining remnants of my friendship to
Nicole? Or complete my total hatred of her. Either way I can't help
Sam without the absolute truth.</p>
<p>"Did she…? I mean was it…rape?" God, I can barely even say the
word. How must it be for Sam to LIVE with it?</p>
<p>She whimpers and pulls me painfully close. Her grip on me is so
tight I can feel bruises forming under her fingers. But that's OK;
she needs me right now.</p>
<p>She's quiet for a long time and I start to think that maybe I pushed
too far.</p>
<p>"For it to be rape, I would have had to have said `no', right?" she
suddenly asks quietly. "I mean, I did at first, but I gave in.
So, `no', right?"</p>
<p>Aw damn. Tricky slope, Sammy. And I think we just crashed down it.
Damn, if I hated Nic before, I loathe her now.</p>
<p>How could Nicole even…?</p>
<p>I mean, to even think about doing that to another human being is
just….</p>
<p>Grrr…</p>
</chapter>

<chapter title="6. Regrouping">
<p>She slept in my bed last night. Said she didn't want to be
alone anymore. What was I going to say, `no'? </p>
<p>Yeah, right. Not in this millennium.</p>
<p>And I'll tell you a secret. Sam snores. </p>
<p>Like, not a `buzz saw' snore. More like a heavy sigh or a cute
little burbling sound. It's really cute, but I said that already
didn't I?</p>
<p>She's been in her own room for over an hour, again repeating the same
song on her CD player over and over. This time it's Creed's `What
if?'. I think she's moved on from anguish to anger, which is a good
sign. Maybe now we can move on to the important things, like kicking
Nicole's peroxide ass so hard her natural birth parents feel it.</p>
<p>Teehee, sounds like fun.</p>
<p>"Hey Brooke?" Her head whips around the door into my room. </p>
<p>NARF!</p>
<p>She's wearing a white tank top with tight jeans, black sneakers and a
silver choker on her neck. And I think my brain just stopped
functioning. Talk amongst yourselves…</p>
<p>"Gah…?" I think I just responded to her. Did I respond?</p>
<p>Am I drooling?</p>
<p>She's smiling at me and if I turn into any more of a puddle I'm going
to have to change my clothes.</p>
<p>"I wanted to know if you wanted go out and to rent some DVD's with
me. It's Sunday and other than football, there's nothing on TV. I'm
not up to actually going out for extended periods of time but I
wouldn't mind hanging out here at home with you."</p>
<p>Define me now as mush. I'm that far gone. And that happy that she's
reaching out to me.</p>
<p>"Sure," I chirp and wince because I sound like I've been sucking on
helium.</p>
<p>She lets me drive which is odd given the fact that Sam loves to
drive. She loves the sense of control, she told me as much once. It
makes me wonder if Nicole robbed her of a lot more than I realize.</p>
<p>"Scooby-Doo OK with you?" she asks after we arrive at Blockbuster.
Now open until 1 Am. Poor bastards. I nod and she skips off to grab
a copy.</p>
<p>She comes back with Scooby, Ghost World, Enough, Lost &amp; Delirious,
and E.T. I've already got Murder By Numbers, Frailty, But I'm A
Cheerleader (a fav), and Coyote Ugly in my hands.</p>
<p>"Not planning on going back to school?" I joke and instantly wish I
could retrieve the words from midair. Shit, that was stupid of me.
Her face falls for an instant but then she pulls it back together.</p>
<p>"If I had a choice, no, but I want to spend the day with you,
watching mindless Hollywood drivel, eating and drinking enough junk
food and soda to kill us and forgetting reality for now," she
announces proudly and I laugh. Sounds good.</p>
<p>We're halfway through the fourth movie, (Frailty) when she suddenly
gets serious on me.</p>
<p>"I want to make her pay, Brooke." </p>
<p>I have no doubt about that, Sammy, and I agree. But I have no idea
how to do it.</p>
<p>So I shrug and grab another handful of popcorn. Besides, she's not
actually looking for verbal feedback as much as a sounding board for
her frustration and anger right now.</p>
<p>I may be blonde, but I'm not stupid. Thank you.</p>
<p>She runs a frustrated hand though her hair; she's sitting so close to
me that it hits me softly on the side of the face. Smells like her
shampoo. Smells like Sam.</p>
<p>"She really hurt me, you know? God, I HATE being used, especially
like that. A fucking `fun fuck'. God," she sighs exasperated. </p>
<p>"Like that's all I'm worth? Was that all she was after, my cherry?
Another freaking notch to add to her bedpost? Another story to tell
the next stupid sap that comes down the pike? Another name in her
little mental `little black book'?"</p>
<p>Good points all. She leans down and puts her head in my lap where I
rhythmically start running my fingers through her hair. It's so
automatic and natural that it's almost frightening. And yet elating
at the same time.</p>
<p>"Seriously, Brooke, was she playing me from the get go? Was it all
an act just to get into my pants and fuck me? To say `yeah, I did
her. I was her first?' like it was some sort of accomplishment? I
realize virgins are rare but are we so rare you have to fuck with our
heads for amusement?"</p>
<p>"Nicole hasn't been a virgin since she was 14. She probably doesn't
even remember BEING one," I snort before I can stop myself. "That and
there's a reason she blew out that knee, remember." </p>
<p>Caffeine makes me say things I shouldn't. Example? Watch.</p>
<p>Sam's eyes light up devilishly.</p>
<p>"14? That's young even for her! Who, how, when?"</p>
<p>"Derrick Masters, a senior our freshman year…at a big party…he fell
asleep during the whole thing…gave her a HUGE complex for a long
time," I babble as my mouth gets a mind of its own. How curious.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that all that data comes under the heading `too much
personal information'. And yet, I don't care. It's not MY
information, after all.</p>
<p>That's it. No more Pepsi Blue for me.</p>
<p>Sam's laughing hysterically and I realize I just spilled one of
Nicole's deepest darkest secrets onto the carpet like a glass of
cranberry juice. It's seeping into the carpet and making a stain.
Uh oh.</p>
<p>But wait, there's more…</p>
<p>"She had…uhm…problems for a little while after," I start to explain.
I have Sam's complete attention, she's sitting back up and the movie
is long forgotten.</p>
<p>"Seems that Derrick wasn't very…discriminating about who he slept
with. Nicole ended up not only with a pregnancy scare because `baby,
condoms kill the feel' as Derrick told her, but he also gave her…crabs."</p>
<p>Ew, soda squirted out her nose. Should have been prepared for that.</p>
<p>Damn it I'm never ready it seems.</p>
<p>She falls dramatically off the couch, half-laughing and half-coughing, red in the face and gorgeous as all hell, even with soda on
her face.</p>
<p>It occurs to me to lick it off. Then I mentally smack myself and
help her off the floor, patting her on the back to get the soda out
of her lungs.</p>
<p>"She…she got crabs?" she gasps trying to get oxygen into her
protesting organs. "Like in the health class `play'? She WAS a
crab!"</p>
<p>And you were a very delectable looking little hooker, Sammy dear.</p>
<p>Oops, drifting…</p>
<p>It takes her several minutes to actually calm down after this new
information. I think she thinks to some extent that I might be lying
and stares at me trying to decide. It's the God's honest truth; I
should know, I went to the clinic with Nicole and Marley Jacobs back
when Marley ruled the school and Nic and I were just heirs to the
throne.</p>
<p>Now Marley was a girl with some issues. Too bad she died before she
could handle them.</p>
<p>"Man, I'd give my eye teeth for PROOF of all that," Sam sighs after
she settles, again with her head in my lap. And suddenly a small
idea starts turning itself around in my head.</p>
<p>"Keep your teeth, Sammy, I have a better idea." I know the smirk on
my face has GOT to be downright evil because she's picked up her head
and arched an eyebrow at me.</p>
<p>She narrows her eyes at me but grins.</p>
<p>"What are you planning, oh evil one?" she asks. </p>
<p>"You wanted revenge, right?' She nods. "Then you'll have it," I
promise. Her smile turns into a grin and she puts her head down and
we rewind the DVD to were we lost the story.</p>
<p>"Brooke?" she asks as the credits start at the end and disturbs me
from my petting of her hair.</p>
<p>"Hmmm?"</p>
<p>"Why DID you chose Nikki over Kelly?"</p>
<p>I feel the evil grin this time and put no effort towards stopping it.</p>
<p>"Two words, Sammy…tongue ring."</p>
</chapter>

<chapter title="7. Hormonal Overdrive">
<p>I should be sleeping but my bunkmate apparently has other ideas.</p>
<p>Sometime around two, Sam slipped into my bed with me and her hands
have been somewhat…less than idle since she got here. I can feel her
breath against my face as she lays in her side next to me letting her
hand wander over my stomach, above my pajama top. Her breaths are
uneven and she knows I'm awake. My soft whimpers and squirming on
the bed would be a REALLY good indication of my state of wakefulness.
</p>
<p>Oh God. She just undid the bottom button of my top and I can feel
her fingertips grazing my abdomen. I can't help the rough gasp that
slips past my lips and I hear her breathing increase at the sound of
it. Her hand is so warm; I just want her to touch me everywhere and
be able to melt into her.</p>
<p>Now her hand is lying flat against my belly, its heat seeming to burn
my skin making me wonder if when it's gone, will I be branded with
her hand print? Not that I would mind if it did. My desire for her
is so great I feel tears leak down my face. To my complete surprise
and supreme joy, I feel her kiss them away.</p>
<p>"Sshh, Brooke, don't cry," she whispers into my ear making me
shiver. "I'm just curious but I'll stop if you want me to." She
almost sounds hurt.</p>
<p>Aww Sammy, no.</p>
<p>"No!" I gasp more forcefully than was necessary. Oops. "It's OK,
really." She smiles at me and then puts her face in the crook of my
neck, letting her breaths wash over my skin and tracing circles on my
abs.
</p>
<p>I cough, not to clear my throat but to keep from sounding too lustful
when I talk. I don't want her to think that I want something from
her that she's not ready to give. Never. I'd rather never have a
moment with her than ever have her think that about me.</p>
<p>"What are you curious about?" I still ended up sounding like a sex-starved sailor just arrived in port. She must have liked it though
because she shivered and snuggled closer.</p>
<p>Does she not think I've noticed that her hand has crept higher under
my shirt? She's dangerously close to my breasts. Yay.</p>
<p>"You." Her mouth is right beside my ear and her tongue darts out to
lick it. I tremble violently with want and whimper as my throat
closes slightly.
</p>
<p>"You're so soft," she continues lowly. Right now she could recite
the yellow pages and I'd be jelly in her hands. Speaking of which, I
hope I have some clean jammies cuz I don't think I'm going to be able
to sleep in these in their current state.</p>
<p>Sorry, overshare.</p>
<p>Gah. Her hand is caressing the underside of my left breast and I'm
in Heaven and in Hell. Everything I want and yet I want more. Damn
it.</p>
<p>"Here, I'll show you what I mean," Sam whispers and her hand leaves
my breast.
</p>
<p>Crying at the loss of contact would be foolish, right?</p>
<p>"Your hips," her hand follows the ridge of my pelvic bone as I lie
still on my back.
</p>
<p>Did I mention that now she's dangerously close to my pants and
underwear?</p>
<p>"Your hips are here," she points out and I nod. Trust me, speech is
not a possibility at this point. "I can feel the bone under here but
it's soft, curvy and lush. I like it."</p>
<p>And I like you touching it, Sammy.</p>
<p>"Your abdomen is muscular, strong. But you're relaxed, somewhat,"
she winks at me and then puts her head back to my neck. "So it's soft
and pillowy."</p>
<p>Uh huuuuuuuuh…</p>
<p>"Your ribs," her hand is wandering back up my stomach and I have
goose bumps as it glides across my skin. "Are under here but don't
jut out roughly. You're smooth, soft, warm…"</p>
<p>Her breathing has picked up again and her voice has dropped a few
octaves. She's aroused herself with her little explanation. Heh.
Me too. As if being further aroused was even possible but apparently
it is.</p>
<p>"Your breasts…"
</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>"Oh God," she echoes my thoughts as she cups the breast she abandoned
earlier. She clears her throat and I wonder if it's for the same
reason I did a little while back.</p>
<p>"Nicole…Nicole was none of those things, Brooke," her voice is still
rough with desire and makes me throb in places I shouldn't. "She was
rough and hard, cold and sharp. You're smooth and soft, warm and
curvy."</p>
<p>Kill me and put me out of my misery or please let me have an orgasm
before I burst into flames, someone…anyone? (Actually, just Sammy
but anyway)</p>
<p>She's pinching and teasing my nipple with her fingers and I want to
beg her to use her mouth but I can't speak. AT ALL. I feel her lean
even closer to my ear.</p>
<p>"And there's something I really need to tell you." She sounds
frightened. I wonder why.</p>
<p>"Uh huuuuuh," I manage to eke out at least that much as her hand
never stills.</p>
<p>"Please don't be mad but…the whole time I was with Nicole that night…after I'd said `yes'…I imagined it was you I was with. That it was
you kissing me, touching me, making me cum. Not her."</p>
<p>The orgasm floods through my body with the power of a freight train
and my upper body rises off the bed. I hear myself grunt loudly,
which I'm not prone to doing. I'm usually pretty quiet. Sam holds
me tightly as I convulse and pant.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," she apologizes near tears.</p>
<p>"Oh God, don't be," I rasp out after my body calms down and I have a
margin of control over it again. Hmm, feels really nice to be
wrapped up in Sam's arms like this feeling the afterglow of a mind-blowing orgasm.
</p>
<p>Damn, and she barely touched me too. I'd probably shatter into a
million pieces if she actually did.</p>
<p>Oh goody. I hope so.</p>
<p>"It's just…I didn't mean for that to happen. I didn't realize you
were so…" she's cute when she babbles.</p>
<p>"Hot? Aroused?" I supply for her making her giggle slightly.
</p>
<p>Looky there, I can speak again.</p>
<p>"Yeah," she replies sheepishly. "Wow."</p>
<p>Understatement anyone?</p>
<p>"Yeah wow," I sigh. Now I'm tired. "Thank you." I kiss her gently
on the lips. After I pull away I can see in the dim light that she's
watching me carefully, probably trying to figure out what I'm going
to do next. I reach up and brush her hair out of her somewhat
haunted eyes.</p>
<p>I can see that she's not ready for anything more, not yet. The
wounds Nicole inflicted are still too raw, too fresh for Sam to give
herself completely over to someone else again right now.</p>
<p>That's OK, I can wait. Knowing that there's a chance makes it easier.</p>
<p>"I think it's time for sleep, huh, Sammy?" I ask and she nods. "OK,
but first I need to change my clothes."
</p>
<p>Oh, Sammy, that smirk should be a registered lethal weapon.</p>
<p>"Why?" she asks innocently as I slip out of the bed. Ha, I'm not
buying that innocent act with that leer going with it.</p>
<p>Oh my God, she's making me blush!</p>
<p>"Uhm, I'm a little bit…damp, Sam," I admit quietly.</p>
<p>"So am I," I hear her whisper and I have to grab the dresser
for support as a shudder shoots through me. My legs are rubber now,
nice job, Sam.</p>
<p>"You can…uh…go change if you want," I cough as I pull out new
pajamas and underwear.</p>
<p>"Nah," she says and shifts on the bed. "Do you want me to
roll over while you change?"</p>
<p>Heh. Why bother? Although it is sweet of her to ask.</p>
<p>"That's entirely up to you," I say. I don't hear the bed
move so I know she's watching. I strip off my shirt, baring my naked
chest to her. Her breath catches and reaches my ears as it hisses
past her lips. I smirk to myself and then strip out of my soaked
pants and underwear.</p>
<p>I'm as open and vulnerable to her gaze as I'm ever going to
get.</p>
<p>God, the hunger in her eyes is unmistakable. I never thought
I'd ever be the object of her obvious desire like that.
</p>
<p>"I don't suppose…" she swallows hard. "I don't suppose, if I
promise to behave, that you'd consider sleeping in the nude, would
you?" she asks. "I just want to hold you, Brooke. You're so damn
beautiful."</p>
<p>How can I say `no' to that?</p>
<p>Besides, it'll probably save me on laundry.</p>
</chapter>

<chapter title="8. Revenge">
<p>Now, how did that happen?</p>
<p>I swear, if you ask me, I have NO idea how Nicole Julian's medical
file from our freshman year got printed on the front page of the
Zapruter. Honestly...NO earthly idea whatsoever.</p>
<p>I mean, I'M not the one who posed as Nicole to get the file. Nope,
nosiree, not me.</p>
<p>Uh...yeah I did. OK, I'll admit THAT much.</p>
<p>But I'm not the newly reinstated editor of the school newspaper.
Nope, innocent over here.</p>
<p>Blonde and clueless, thank you.</p>
<p>OK, I just HAVE to read this thing again...it amuses me:</p>
<p>'According to sources close to the Zapruter, (i.e. Me...shhh)
Nicole Julian has a long and colorful sexual history. Now it isn't
the habit of this paper or this reporter to air the predatory sexual
habits of its readers but due to the shocking nature of the truth in
this case, serving the public interest overwhelms any ethical qualms
we might have.</p>
<p>Nicole Julian is a slut.</p>
<p>The truth is as plain and obvious as the black and white
paper you hold in your hands.</p>
<p>Medical files obtained by this paper through unnamed sources
shows Ms Julian's long history of sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
<p>Think that it doesn't happen to the rich, powerful,
beautiful, and bitchy?</p>
<p>Read on:</p>
<p>In the span of four years, Ms Julian has been treated at least once
for:</p>
<p>- Pubic lice (crabs)<br/>
- Chlamydia<br/>
- Gonorrhea (although we will point out that this was an ORAL
infection, this time)<br/>
- Three pregnancy scares<br/>
- And a miscarriage.</p>
<p>Now, as stated earlier, it is not the practice of this paper to air
the dirty laundry of one of its readers but we feel that Nicole
Julian is a danger to the public at large.</p>
<p>As one of her former victims, I wish I had been better informed of
her sexual history.</p>
<p>If there is any doubt to the validity of these claims, one need only
to look at pages 2-6 where Ms Julian's full medical file is printed. </p>
<p>You can not deny the written word, as stated by medical fact.</p>
<p>So next time you think and STD can't happen to you, think about
Nicole Julian. Despite her money and popularity, it happens to her.</p>
<p>Repeatedly.</p>
<p>And by the way...I've tested clean.</p>
<p>Editor-in-chief<br/>
Samantha McPherson</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sneaky, sneaky little Sammy included pictures of crabs,
medical explanation, treatments, and the file and x-rays on Nicole's
knee. You know, the one she blew out because she spent too much time
on them? Yeah, that effectively lost her her spot on the Glamazons
as of noon today. That brought me much glee. </p>
<p>And of course, Nicole much rage.</p>
<p>She's been stalking around the halls looking for Sam,
threatening to sue for liable and shit. Lily keeps chiming in
about 'First Amendment rights' and all that before ducking out of
Nicole's way. And the rest of the school population won't go NEAR
Nic. She is effectively, Typhoid Mary. And I think I heard someone
humming Matchbox Twenty's 'I've got a disease' when she walked by a
little while ago.</p>
<p>Heh heh. About time she got hers. I'm getting a wonderful perverse
sense of joy out of all this.</p>
<p>Then again, most of it WAS my idea. I'm just glad Sam went for it.</p>
<p>"Hey.¨ her voice suddenly sounds WAY too close to my right ear and I
think I must have just jumped 4 feet straight up. She wasn't there a
second ago, she was hiding in the Novak.</p>
<p>Her arms wrap around me and she holds me tight. I'm already halfway
to mush just hearing the purr of her voice, her touch finishes the
job.</p>
<p>Gah...</p>
<p>God, I'm hopeless.</p>
<p>"I didn't mean to scare you.¨ she apologizes while nuzzling my hair.
Man, she does such things to my body with just the simplest of
touches.</p>
<p>"It's OK.¨ I assure her, leaning back into her somewhat. I sigh
happily. I can't help it. I'm in her arms, what more could I want?</p>
<p>"Brooke, I want to go home.¨ she states, her voice low and gravely.
It sends a chill straight down my spine and then between my legs.
Damn, I may have to go home just to change my clothes.</p>
<p>Have you any idea what my laundry basket has looked like for the past
two weeks since that night in bed?</p>
<p>Yeah, my clothes are always in the wash now.</p>
<p>Except my pajamas. I don't wear any. We haven't done anything more
than kiss and hold each other but I stopped dressing for bed at Sam's
request. She alternates between naked and tee shirt with boxers,
depending on her mood. Either is fine with me as long as she's there.</p>
<p>"I want to go home and hold you.¨ she murmurs making me shiver more.
There's something different in her voice. And undertone that's
making my insides quake.</p>
<p>"OK.¨ is all I can manage to respond.</p>
<p>GAH! She just licked the back of my neck and if she wasn't holding
me up I think I would have swooned.</p>
<p>"Maybe do a little more than just...hold you.¨ she teases. </p>
<p>Breathe, Brooke. In with the good air, out with the bad.</p>
<p>I turn around in her arms so that I can look her in the eyes.</p>
<p>"Sam...?¨ She blushes and looks at me both sheepishly and seductively
at the same time.</p>
<p>Don't ask. I don't know HOW she pulls that off.</p>
<p>She looks me directly in the eyes, no wavering or doubt written in
them at this moment.</p>
<p>"You, are not Nicole Julian.¨ she says firmly. "You are not going to
hurt me. I don't think you could even if you wanted to.¨</p>
<p>Which I don't.</p>
<p>"When you look at me, I see only love, compassion, desire,
friendship, and adoration. I don't see any ulterior motive behind
those beautiful blue-green eyes of yours. I feel safe with you,
Brooke. I feel loved.¨</p>
<p>"You are.¨ I hear myself whisper.</p>
<p>Damn was that out loud?</p>
<p>Judging by the million-watt smile she's shooting me, yes, it was
indeed out loud. Then again, if she's going to smile like that at me
when I say it, I'll say it a million times a day.</p>
<p>"I love you too, Brooke.¨</p>
<p>My knees just gave out. Thankfully Sammy caught me.</p>
<p>Head spinning...</p>
<p>"Never thought...¨ Hyperventilating. "You'd feel...same...say it...I...I...¨</p>
<p>She sits me down on the floor, mildly panicked. Well, no duh! I just went all
'Rainman' in her arms. </p>
<p>How romantic. Snarfle.</p>
<p>"Are you OK?¨ she asks concerned.</p>
<p>"Yeah.¨ Oh look, coherency. It's not just a vague notion. I look up
at her beautiful worried face. "Can we go home now?¨</p>
<p>She smiles that radiant Sam smile and nods.</p>
<p>"I'd like that, a lot.¨ she says. Her voice is all husky and I'm not
sure my legs are going to support me if she keeps talking like that.</p>
</chapter>

<chapter title="9. Homecoming">
<p>I speed all the way home and almost take out the mailbox pulling into the
driveway, which makes her giggle. </p>
<p>`But Officer, her hand's been on my thigh, rubbing and squeezing since we
left the school parking lot. Would YOU be able to drive slow to get her home?'</p>
<p>Yeah, I thought not.</p>
<p>I have trouble getting out of the car. I'm like, stuck in my seat unable to
move. Sam comes around to my side and helps me out, holding my hand all the way
into the house and then leads me up to my bedroom.</p>
<p>She kisses me gently at first, then with more passion and urgency. I feel
her moist tongue lick my bottom lip and I gladly permit her entrance to my
mouth.</p>
<p>She wastes no time, stroking the inside of my mouth, the roof and my teeth;
teasing my tongue to play with her own. It's a fun duel, slow and sensual
especially as I feel her hands wander under my shirt and up my back. She's
pulling me closer so that we're pressed tightly together in the middle of the
room. I don't think a piece of paper could fit between us now.</p>
<p>She breaks away from my mouth and makes a trail to my ear.</p>
<p>"Show me, Brooke," she growls and I tremble in her arms. "Show me what love
is. Your love."</p>
<p>Oh God.</p>
<p>You see, I have this theory about myself. It's a tad embarrassing but then
again, what the hell? I think that below my seemingly innocent, calm exterior,
there lies a beast. A fiery, passionate animal that if properly aroused would
overtake my normal personality and shed all my inhibitions and blow your socks
off. And `she' scares me. I've never let `her' out during sex, no matter how
wild it's gotten. There's a level of trust involved with unleashing `the beast'
that I've yet to find with anyone. I think that someday I might be able to do so
with Sam.</p>
<p>But not tonight. Tonight is our first time together. I want it to be
special, slow and passionate but there's so much I want to show Sammy. To show
her how much I love her and would never hurt her.</p>
<p>"Sammy," I gasp as I nibble on her neck and jaw. My hands are shaking as I
try to unbutton her oversized flannel shirt. She covers my hands with her own
and smiles at me.</p>
<p>"Easy, Brooke," she whispers with so much love in her voice that it break my
heart. No, that's not right. My heart swells with so much happiness it nearly
bursts.</p>
<p>She loves me!</p>
<p>"Let me," she offers and then proceeds to undo the blasted shirt. After she
removes it and tosses it away, I send it a hateful glare. Evil, evil thing. It
kept me from my Sammy.</p>
<p>I may burn it in revenge later. Anyway.</p>
<p>God, she's so beautiful. Her skin is a warm milky color and seems to glow in
the pale sunlight coming in the window behind her. Standing there in her bra,
jeans and sneakers, I doubt that I've seen anything as gorgeous as she is in
this moment.</p>
<p>I kneel before my Goddess to worship her as she deserves to be worshipped.</p>
<p>"Brooke?" I hear her question. I say nothing but unlace her shoes and then
remove them and her socks as she giggles at me.</p>
<p>"Careful, I'm ticklish," she warns. Useful information for later, I think
evilly.</p>
<p>My hands travel up her jeans-clad legs, tracing their sculpting and coming to
rest on her hips. Whether she realizes it or not, she's spread her legs a
little further apart since I initially kneeled. It's incredibly tempting to do
as I want, be as wild with her right now as my blood screams out to be but, the
timing isn't right and I know it. So I place a hot kiss on her groin, over her
clothes and shiver when her moan reaches my ears even as her hands suddenly bury
themselves in my hair.</p>
<p>"Brooooooke," she hisses as she strokes my hair. I look up at her looking
down at me, eyes so full of desire it's amazing and smile.</p>
<p>"Soon, my Sammy," I promise as I unzip her jeans and slide them down over her
legs. She steps out of them and kicks them away as I stand back up, letting my
right hand brush none too lightly against the obvious wet spot on her panties.
With another moan, she pulls me into a heated kiss as she impatiently tries to
pull my shirt off. A loud ripping sound tells me that that shirt is now a rag
with which I will be washing my car.</p>
<p>I discard it as she bites at my bottom lip and rakes her nails against my
back. I may have every intention of being gentle but I think I forgot to tell
Sammy.</p>
<p>I take control again and shove her onto the bed before taking off my own
pants as she watches hungrily. I can feel `the beast' rattling her cage and I
know I'm going to have to fight for control.</p>
<p>Sam reaches around herself and unhooks her bra. Then she shimmies out of her
underwear. I'm frozen as I stare at the vision lying naked on my bed.</p>
<p>"Brooke." she whimpers breathlessly as her back arches and she reaches for
me. I practically rip off my own underwear and stretch my body out over hers.</p>
<p>God, I want to melt right into her forever.</p>
<p>Her hands are everywhere at once; on my back, my breasts, my sides, my ass.
I want her everywhere but this isn't about me. I need to get control of my
hormones.</p>
<p>"Sam," I'm panting as she licks at my collarbone. I'm losing myself in the
feel of her body below mine and I think it's the same for her. The want, the
need and sensations are running away with us. I kiss her hard and slow to calm
her and she relaxes somewhat beneath me.</p>
<p>"Let me." I swallow and try to regain my composure. "Let me show you, Sammy.
Slow and the right way, OK?" She nods, the desire swirling plainly in her eyes
even as her body rocks slowly against mine. I'm on fire and it's delicious.</p>
<p>"Let me know if...if I do something you don't like, OK?" It's important to me
to do everything right because her experience with Nicole was so bad. I wish I
could erase that but since I can't, I'll give her a wonderful memory to
overwrite it with.</p>
<p>"OK," she pants back. There's so much trust in her voice, in her eyes that I
almost want to cry. But, my body has other things in mind.</p>
<p>I put my arms on either side of her head to support myself and put the rest
of my body against hers, sliding my thigh between her slightly parted legs. She
spreads them further apart to accommodate me and then wraps those beautiful
sculpted long limbs around my thigh, pulling me closer to her. I can feel the
moisture of her arousal coating the skin on my leg and my arms nearly give out
as she grinds slowly against me. She's so hot and wet that it nearly overwhelms
me.</p>
<p>I press the hard muscle of my thigh against her wet center and capture her
lips as she moans under me, swallowing the cry and teasing her full lips with my
tongue. I'm controlling the kiss as I caress her tongue with my own, lick her
lips and nibble on her jaw.</p>
<p>Her hands are playing with my breasts in a most delightful torture as I rock
against her. I lick and nip at her ear, listening to the gasps and moans
rolling from her lips as her mouth rests besides my ear.</p>
<p>My arms give out in a very sloppy fashion as Sam raises the thigh I'm
straddling and she grinds it against my own wet flesh.</p>
<p>"God, Sammy." I gasp, the feelings and sensations rolling through my body are
setting my blood on fire.</p>
<p>"I wanted to feel you against me," she growls. The rough sound of her voice
makes `the beast' inside me howl for release.</p>
<p>My next kiss isn't so gentle and I have to fight with myself to calm down no
matter how much it seems Sam liked it.</p>
<p>I bury myself in her neck, kissing and licking as she moves against me, her
actions growing quicker and more needy.</p>
<p>Her breasts are of endless fascination to me. Round and full, soft and
smooth. I find myself occupied by them for a while. First the right nipple,
which I suckle ardently and flick with my tongue, aking her back arch and hands
grasp my hair, and then the left. I repeat the process, don't want anyone to
feel neglected...and then nibble a little. She whimpers and pulls at my hair.</p>
<p>"Sorry." I apologize. </p>
<p>"Broooooke." her whine is pitiful sounding in need. I look up over her
rapidly rising and falling chest to see her flushed face and realize she's
totally gone; given herself over to me.</p>
<p>I let my hand graze lightly over the skin on her inner thigh to gauge her
reaction. She moves against me seeking more contact. I let my fingers play
through her soft hairs, teasing the hidden flesh beneath, eliciting another
whimper.</p>
<p>"Pleeeeeasssssssssse." she begs, her eyes shut and panting heavily.</p>
<p>I slide easily through her warmth, my own eyes fluttering back at the mere
feel of her wetness against my finger. I've experienced other women before, not
many but none have ever been as wet and hot as Sammy is. I'm coated in her in
seconds as I stroke her, seeking out her clit and making her cry out.</p>
<p>"Oh God." One of her hands has flown backwards to grab the headboard as the
other grasps the bed sheets. I watch her beautiful face as I pleasure her by
resting my head on her stomach. Her heartbeat beneath my ear is wild, thumping
against her chest as she undulates against my hand.</p>
<p>I tease her opening with the tip of my index finger and that's when I feel
her freeze; not because of an orgasm but because of fear.</p>
<p>"Sammy?" I ask gently. Her eyes open and focus blearily on mine. She looks
uncertain now and I'm scared I've done something wrong.</p>
<p>"When...with Nic." She's panting and having trouble concentrating.</p>
<p>Wonder why. Giggle</p>
<p>"What about Nic, baby?" I encourage her to talk. OK, so I REALLY don't want
to discuss Nicole right now, but, whatever Sam needs to say, I'll listen.</p>
<p>She bites her lip and sighs.</p>
<p>"It hurt." she whimpers in memory. Oh.</p>
<p>OH!!! Oops...duh.</p>
<p>"I understand, honey," I soothe, moving up slightly to kiss her. Now I'm
lying next to her looking her in the eyes. "When Nicole...it always hurts the
first time or so, Sammy. I'm sorry that she wasn't gentle with you. She should
have been, especially for your first time. I won't do that if you're not ready,
OK?"</p>
<p>She looks thoughtful for a minute and then gives me a smoldering look that I
swear could set a forest fire in Antarctica.</p>
<p>"I want you inside me, Brooke." she whispers huskily. </p>
<p>I nearly cum just at her words. Damn, how does she DO that?</p>
<p>"If it hurts, tell me, I'll stop," I promise and she nods. "I'd never hurt
you."</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>I begin moving my hand again and after a few minutes, slip inside her tight
channel. God, she clamped down on me instantly and so tightly it almost hurts.
She stopped moving for a second and I'm worried.</p>
<p>"Sammy.?"</p>
<p>"Mmmmmmmmm, God, don't stop, feels good." she moans wantonly. I smile and
start circling her clit with my thumb, doubling the sensations as I move my
finger inside her, stroking as deep as I can and then pulling out slightly.</p>
<p>She's soaking my hand in her moisture again as she mumbles and whimpers
incoherently, moving faster against my hand and crying out for more.</p>
<p>"More, Brooke, deeper," she growls. I'm careful as I slip another finger in
to join the first. I don't want to stretch her too much and inadvertently cause
her pain.</p>
<p>"Oh God Yes!" Her head is thrown back, her back is arched and she's covered
in a fine sheen of sweat making her glow as she bucks against me trying to reach
her release. I swirl my tongue around her nipple again and begin to suckle and
bite at it as I curl my fingers upward inside her.</p>
<p>And she explodes.</p>
<p>She screams as the orgasm slams into her like an ocean wave, robbing her of
all control as she convulses against my hand and fills it with her pleasure.
Her orgasm seems endless as it crushes my fingers and it further intensifies the
ache between my own legs. I'm still riding her thigh and almost there.</p>
<p>My desire...need for release is so sharp it hurts.</p>
<p>Its sharp edges are digging into my abdomen as I feel my own orgasm teasing
me at the edges of my reach.</p>
<p>As if reading my thoughts, Sam, still panting, raises her thigh as just I
thrust downward. My sudden orgasm coats her thigh as I collapse against her
shaking.</p>
<p>It's a few minutes before either of us move. And `the beast' isn't
satisfied. Oh, `she's' happy, but there's one more thing `she' wants.</p>
<p>And I decide to give in.</p>
<p>I move down Sam's prone body, settling myself between her still trembling
thighs. Her head raises slightly, hooded eyes regarding me questioningly.</p>
<p>"Brooke?" Her voice is hoarse and low. "What are you doing?"</p>
<p>My smirk must be rather devilish because her eyes spark suddenly with desire.</p>
<p>"Why, Sammy, I'm going to lick you clean," I announce saucily before diving
in before she can respond. Her response is to bury her hands in my hair and
push me closer into her.</p>
<p>Mmmmmmmmmm...yummy. She's sweet, with this slight salty tang that makes my
tongue tingle. I lick up every drop of wetness I can find but she only replaces
it as fast as I work.</p>
<p>Hmmm...gotta work harder.</p>
<p>I slip my tongue inside her and repeat the earlier actions of my fingers
while my nose rubs against her clit. She's nearly pulling out my hair as she
rides my face. My name...MY NAME is flowing constantly from her lips.</p>
<p>She traps my tongue inside her as she cums this time and I nearly drown in
her flowing juices as I try to drink it all down. I don't want to miss a drop.</p>
<p>Oh my sweet sweet Sammy.</p>
<p>After she returns from bliss, she pulls me up beside her and wraps herself
around me like a human blanket. I can tell she's tired.</p>
<p>"I'm going to repay that," she whispers sleepy as her eyes droop shut and she
buries her head in the crook of my neck. "Right after my nap." And she's out.</p>
<p>That's OK. I can wait. Sammy loves me and we have all the time in the world
for paybacks.</p>
</chapter>

<chapter title="10. Epilogue">
<p>Speaking of paybacks. You wanna know what happened to Nicole after that whole
newspaper thing?</p>
<p>Moved to New York last I heard.</p>
<p>I mean, she was GONE the next day when we got to school. Not a word to
anyone, not even Mary Cherry who, I gotta tell you, is like a baby duck
following Lily around now. Between her and Josh, Lily looks pretty damn silly.</p>
<p>And that's a threesome visual I DON'T need.</p>
<p>So Sam's school life is calming down; I'm `out' and damn proud, letting
everyone know Sam is with me and that I will NEVER hurt her.</p>
<p>Nicole is gone; no one misses her, needs her or wants her. </p>
<p>Life is good.</p>
<p>Hasta la vista, baby.</p>
<p>Ding dong the witch is dead.</p>
<p>Free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty, we are.</p>
<p>"Brooke, what are you doing?" Sam's voice floats over to me and breaks my
train of thought. I lean back on the bed.</p>
<p>"Uhm...thinking?" I respond shakily. Of course, if her warm, long fingers
weren't currently crawling up the insides of my thighs, I might have been able
to form a more articulate response.</p>
<p>"Well, stop that," she purrs seductively. "I believe I owe you something.?"
She licks her lips and I whimper.</p>
<p>I don't know why I didn't see THAT coming. </p>
<p>::evil grin::</p>
<p>You can just leave my head now. Sammy and I need private time.</p>
<p>Bye!</p>
