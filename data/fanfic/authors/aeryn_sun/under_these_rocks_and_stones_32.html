<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ The Dinner Party Pt.2 -->

<p>After everyone's big announcements, there was a brief but understandable awkward silence at the table. The four girls, and now Sugar Daddy, knew that those new to the information were quietly processing and settling their shock. So far, the night had been pleasantly calm, with only Harrison's small outburst. Even he was quiet now, thinking things over. Nicole, for one, prayed that things stayed calm.</p>
<p>"Yo, I can't stand this quiet guys," Sugar Daddy spoke up grinning slightly. "What is, what is, you know? This is a PARTY! Let's have some fun! I'm here with the people who mean the most to me. You're all like my family. So let's enjoy ourselves." Everyone seemed to relax some with his declaration and Brooke smiled in agreement.</p>
<p>"Sugar Daddy's right," she said firmly. She turned to Nicole. "Nic, dinner was fabulous. You're the party planner so, what else have you got up your incredibly expensive sleeve?" Nicole's face lit up.</p>
<p>"Well, I had thought about getting a band to play but then figured that a DJ would be better. The Ballroom has been turned into a full-blown club for those who might be interested," she said slyly. Mary Cherry hopped up from her seat.</p>
<p>"Let's rave, y'all!" she yelled.</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Since the atmosphere was a tad `young' for them, Jane and Terri sat to the side of the ballroom watching as the group of teens mingled and joked around with each other. They were both happy to see the awkwardness and the apprehensive air that temporarily seemed to grip the group fall away, although Harrison was still a bit quiet.</p>
<p>"The way I figure it, if he hasn't run off by now, he's not going to," Terri observed, reading Jane's mind as the concerned mother watched Sam try and strike up small talk with the slightly phobic boy. Harrison smiled a bit at Sam and then wandered over to the snack table. "He'll come around and deal with the whole thing, given time." Jane nodded her head in agreement.</p>
<p>"Brooke and Sam both mean too much to him for him to just turn his back," she said relieved. "I was worried."</p>
<p>"I know you were. So was I. But things have a way of working themselves out, Jane. You'll see," Terri reassured her softly while patting her shoulder. Jane arched an eyebrow at her and smirked.</p>
<p>"Being an optimist must be a blonde trait," she said dryly. Terri laughed.</p>
<p>"Natural blonde, natural optimist," she agreed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam sighed as Harrison retreated. It bothered her that he was so squirrelly around her but she was holding out the hope that he'd find his way through his issues and confusion. And she was heartened by the fact that he was sticking around. She walked around the floor, spotting her mother talking with Terri for a moment before she found Brooke. She walked up close to her blonde love, nuzzled Brooke's cheek with her nose and then put her lips next to Brooke's ear so that she'd be heard over the pulsing beat that had surrounded them.</p>
<p>"Brooke, hon, do you ever think that there's something going on between my mother and your aunt?" she asked in all seriousness. It was something she'd been kind of wondering for a while, having noticed a certain something between the two women. But then again, she figured, maybe she was imagining things.</p>
<p>Brooke pulled away slightly to look at Sam in obvious shock. She then turned to look at Jane and Terri who were huddled close in deep conversation.</p>
<p>"Sam," she started gravely. "There isn't enough money on the planet to buy me a ticket on THAT train of thought!"</p>
<p>They both burst out laughing.</p>
<p>"It would SO be the last nail in the coffin containing Mike's mental health!" Sam snickered.</p>
<p>"Oh God, he'd die!" Brooke roared.</p>
<p>"Hmm, let's see: his daughter, ex-fiancee, near stepdaughter, and former sister-in-law all turning out to be Sapphic? Maybe it IS something about him," Sam joked.</p>
<p>"Oh stop," Brooke giggled. "You are so bad sometimes." Sam smirked devilishly.</p>
<p>"I try," she admitted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further across the dance floor, Lily reclined slightly in her lover's arms watching their friends enjoy the party and blissfully happy with the current state of her life.</p>
<p>"It's a wonderful party, Niki. Thank you," she murmured happily. Nicole hugged her a little tighter.</p>
<p>"I'm glad that you like it, baby. And I'm relieved that it's going so well," she observed. Lily nodded.</p>
<p>"It was worth the risk, Niki. I feel so much better now that everyone knows about us. It's like we're finally free to be ourselves, without any acts or secrets. Keeping it a secret was painful. Especially since I'm so proud of you."</p>
<p>"Of me?" Nicole asked surprised. Lily turned around in Nicole's arms so that they were face to face.</p>
<p>"Yes, you," she smiled, kissing Nicole lightly. "You are so different from who you used to be. You've come so far and I'm proud of that, of you. I'm proud to love you."</p>
<p>"Aw, Lil, stop," Nicole admonished, tears welling up in her eyes. "If I cry with this much makeup on I'll end up looking like a raccoon on fright night. We wouldn't want that." Lily laughed.</p>
<p>"No, definitely not," she snickered. "Sorry, didn't mean to go all `Hallmark' on you but I wanted you to know how I felt." Nicole arched an eyebrow.</p>
<p>"It was more `Oprah' than `Hallmark', but I'll forgive you."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>As the party progressed, Nicole grew steadily more quiet, which bothered Lily because by all accounts the party was a huge success. Everyone, even Harrison was having a fabulous time. He'd relaxed considerably and was teasing Sam and Brooke about the same old childhood things.</p>
<p>&lt;Guess he'd rather have his friends as they are then end up alone&gt; Lily figured, incredibly relieved. Although she noticed Harrison was still rather skittish around Sugar Daddy. &lt;What is it with that stupid double standard?&gt; she wondered. &lt;Guys don't mind two women together but put a gay man in the room and suddenly they become uber-macho or behave like scared little girls. It's ridiculous&gt;</p>
<p>Across the room, Mary Cherry was dancing (if you could CALL it dancing, Lily wasn't sure) with an incredibly gallant and patient George. He looked incredibly put-upon but was hiding it well. Josh however, was having a good laugh at his buddy as George suffered another stepped on foot by the Texan who was `feeling the music'.</p>
<p>Lily turned to Nicole again. As much fun as Nicole seemed to be having, she still seemed troubled by something. There was something on the petite blonde's mind, nagging at her like a persistent itch. She was quiet but fidgety. She kept wringing her hands and biting her bottom lip absently. Lily might have found the whole display cute if she could understand the cause behind it.</p>
<p>After seeming to fight with herself rather intensely for the better part of an hour, Lily watched as Nicole apparently came to some sort of a decision. She excused herself from the party and disappeared out the ballroom door. Lily sighed. Sometimes she just didn't understand the workings of Nicole Julian's mind, no matter how much she loved her. Smiling to herself, she walked over to Sugar Daddy and started talking to him about his boyfriend Nate.</p>
<p>"He's a really nice guy, Lily. You'd like him," Sugar Daddy beamed with pride. "He's studying to become a special education teacher. God, he is so good with kids, yo. They like, flock around him."</p>
<p>"That's wonderful, Sugar. Why didn't you bring him?" Lily asked. Sugar blushed.</p>
<p>"I wanted to but, I was afraid it might not go over well. And I thought that I should tell you guys before I just `sprang' him on you like that. The whole `respect' angle, you know?" Lily nodded. "Anyway, he couldn't make it this time. He has a little brother, Brian, who's autistic. Nate promised his parents he'd be home because Brian's starting a new school and they wanted him to help get Brian settled."</p>
<p>"He sounds like a very compassionate person," Lily observed. Sugar smiled. </p>
<p>"He is."</p>
<p>Out of the corner of her eye, Lily noticed Nicole reappearing on the makeshift stage at the head of the room. The blonde cleared her throat and smiled nervously as the song playing ended and the entire room's attention was suddenly shifted to her.</p>
<p>"Uhm?hey," she stammered haltingly. Her former `bitch' bravado was long gone and she was feeling oddly vulnerable. "Is everyone having a good time?"</p>
<p>A chorus of cheers and a loud `Hell Yeah' from Sugar Daddy answered her. Her smile widened as she relaxed marginally.</p>
<p>"Good, I'm glad. Honestly, I was a little?no, a LOT nervous as to how tonight was going to play out. It could have gone any number of ways, most of them reminiscent of a Shakespeare tragedy, and that scared me. Especially after all the money I poured into looking this good." She did a 360 twirl on stage to another chorus of whistles.</p>
<p>"Seriously," she laughed. "Look, you all know that I don't come from a nice and warm fuzzy place. My family was cold and harsh so I was raised to be that way too. It turned me cold and into the bitch so fondly referred to by the greater populace as Satan."</p>
<p>"Satan, the Bitch of Kennedy, She-Bitch from Hell, Satan's Hell Spawn?" Sam ticked off nicknames on her fingers until Brooke nudged her to shut up. Nicole snickered.</p>
<p>"Thanks Spam. Anyway, I'm the first to admit I was all of those things. The Julian family, except my Nana, was cruel, cold and mean. And because I was afraid of being vulnerable and getting hurt, I hid behind that. I know I can be a total bitch."</p>
<p>"Here here," Sam cheered making everyone laugh. Nicole glared at the girl but the blonde's blue eyes twinkled with mirth.</p>
<p>"Pipe down, Spam, before I can you," she warned with a grin. "As I was saying, I played the part of the bitch. I was good at it. And I might have gotten stuck that way if it hadn't been for all of you. In your own ways, you've all helped me realize that `the bitch' isn't who I really am. And by accepting me tonight, your warmth and love have given me the strength to be myself. You are my real family. Thank you."</p>
<p>Everyone was quiet for a few moments as Nicole's unexpected but heartfelt words sank in. Then Harrison, of all people, began to applaud her and everyone joined in.</p>
<p>"Yeah Nicole!"</p>
<p>"Whoo Hoo!"</p>
<p>"She's human y'all!" rang out around her. Nicole laughed and waved at them to quiet down.</p>
<p>"Hang on guys, I'm not finished," she explained. Brooke rolled her eyes dramatically.</p>
<p>"Please, Nic, when are you EVER done?" she joked.</p>
<p>"You know me, B, always have to have the last word," Nicole retorted playfully. She then grew serious and turned to Lily. "I love you, Lily Esposito."</p>
<p>"I love you too, Nicole," Lily responded. Nicole shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, I don't think you understand. A few seconds ago, Mary Cherry yelled that I was `human'. I never used to be, Lily. Not until you. You helped me rediscover what that meant. You brought out my human side again. And I can't thank you enough for that."</p>
<p>"Oh, Nic," Lily sighed with tears brimming in her brown eyes.</p>
<p>"Crap, I'm about to go all sentimental on you guys, so bear with me. This isn't my strong suit," Nicole complained. "I'm not good with emotions but there are some things I need to say." She took a deep breath before she continued.</p>
<p>"For so long, Lily, I watched you at school, everyday. I thought about how pretty you were and independent. How you stood up for the things that you believed in, even if it meant carrying around a dead frog in a plastic purse. You didn't care what anyone thought, you were convinced of your convictions. Meanwhile I just followed what I was told to by popular society. You always seemed to have this fire inside you and I envied that. Coveted it," she began to explain. "I was always in awe of your strength, your compassion, and your willingness to fight for the things that you wanted."</p>
<p>"And yet, I ridiculed you for it. Mocked you at every opportunity because the more I got to know you, the more I liked you. And that scared me. I'm not supposed to have emotions, I'm above them. They were bred out of me a long time ago. But with you I found I had no control over what my heart chose to do."</p>
<p>"So, I admired you from afar, fell more and more enraptured with you each day until you filled the empty places in my heart. You made my life brighter by just being in it. But I knew that because of who I was and the things that I had done, that I didn't have a prayer of ever finding a home in your heart."</p>
<p>"But Niki?" Lily sobbed quietly as Sugar Daddy rubbed her shoulders.</p>
<p>"But, you know, that was OK. I knew who I was and what I'd done. It became more important to me that you be happy. I thought maybe, for a while that Sam would be the person to do that for you. I knew how you felt for her. It was plain as day and how someone who claims to be as smart as observant as Spam missed it for so long is beyond me," she joked. "But then I began to see the emotional walls Sam had built began to crack and I knew she was hopelessly head-over-heels in love with Brooke. Imagine my surprise when I saw the same look mirrored on B's face when she looked at Sam."</p>
<p>A trickle of laughter ruffled through the group.</p>
<p>"But still, I daren't hope. I couldn't let myself believe that you'd ever look at me the way you looked at Sam. Such adoration, love, and admiration. When you looked at me, I only saw suspicion, wariness, and the pain I'd caused you. But that night, when I saw you out walking by yourself, I HAD to take the chance. Maybe you'd let me get to know you better, just maybe."</p>
<p>"OK, I'm rambling," she sighed as she stared out into the faces watching her with rapt attention, not a few tearstained.</p>
<p>"Keep going, Nicole, we're listening," George encouraged her. Nicole bit her lip and started again.</p>
<p>"I'd never taken a chance like that before. I couldn't stand it anymore and I had to try, Lil. If I tried and you turned me down, at least then I'd KNOW. For absolute sure. But if I never asked, never took the chance, I'd always wonder `what if?' It would have driven me insane."</p>
<p>"And look where we ended up," she smiled. "It hasn't been a smooth ride, my love, but we're here. And when you look at me, all I see in your beautiful eyes is boundless love, hope, and possibility. I believe in all of it, Lily. Because I have you." Nicole walked off the stage and approached Lily.</p>
<p>"I know my money means nothing to you," she said softly.  "But it's yours. So is my heart, my body, and my soul. To keep as long as you want them. I love you, Lily, more than I ever thought possible. Nothing I could say or buy you could ever show you how much. But I hope this shows you, at least a little bit." She took out a red velvet box and opened it, revealing a stunning diamond ring.</p>
<p>Set on a platinum band was an oval shaped diamond solitaire surrounded on both sides by two smaller heart shaped diamonds. Everyone gathered there stared at the ring in shock.</p>
<p>"A promise ring, Lily. I promise myself to you, always," Nicole finished. Lily gasped at the beauty of the ring and shook as Nicole placed it on her finger.</p>
<p>"Is this OK, Lily?" Nicole gently asked. Tears spilled down Lily's face. She threw her arms around Nicole and started to cry.</p>
<p>"Yes, Niki, yes," she sobbed, albeit happily. "Always."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Since the house was so large, everyone simply stayed over, leaving to their assigned rooms when they got tired. Sugar Daddy and Mary Cherry were the last to drop.</p>
<p>"Wow, that ring was?wow," Brooke said in wonder as Sam yawned and settled in the bed.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Sam agreed tiredly.</p>
<p>"And the look on Lily's face. She was stunned."</p>
<p>"Heh, so was I. So was the room for that matter," Sam pointed out. Brooke turned out the light and then moved to spoon behind Sam. She loved the feel of Sam's warm body against her chest or back when they spooned. She felt so safe and happy wrapped up like that.</p>
<p>She put one arm around Sam's waist and intertwined their fingers together. They were quiet for a while listening to each other breathe.</p>
<p>"Would you like a ring someday, Brooke?" Sam asked quietly. Brooke squeezed her hand and nuzzled her nose against Sam's back.</p>
<p>"Sure, I guess maybe," she replied just as soft. "But Sam, it's not about the ring. It's about the expression of love surrounding it." Sam sighed.</p>
<p>"I know," she said. "It's just?I really would like to give you the world, Brooke. But I can't." Brooke leaned up and kissed her ear.</p>
<p>"And I've told you that all I want is you," she reminded her brunette love. Sam was quiet again.</p>
<p>"I could suck on a LifeSaver until it fit you," she suddenly giggled. "Now THAT I could afford. You could even pick the flavor."</p>
<p>"That'd be perfect, Sammy. Can I have a cherry flavored one?" Brooke joked.</p>
<p>"Uhmm hmmm, whatever you want `cept coconut. I hate coconut," Sam's voice started to drift off. Brooke tightened her hold on Sam and smiled.</p>
<p>"Good night, my love. My Sam."</p>
