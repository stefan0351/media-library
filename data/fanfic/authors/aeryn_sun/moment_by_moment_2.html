<!-- Moment by Moment \ 2. The Fall -->

<p>I should have been better prepared.</p>
<p>Granted, in my own defense, even in my worst nightmares I
couldn't have seen what was coming but, damn it, I should have known
Nicole was up to SOMETHING. She'd had that maniacal gleam in her
eyes all freaking day and it was making my skin crawl.</p>
<p>Note to self: never keep a best friend who reminds you of a
serial killer on acid.</p>
<p>In front of a cafeteria full of onlookers, at the height of
the lunch rush, Nicole blew Sam out of the water.</p>
<p>"I've got sad news for you, Spam," she sneered and my heart
dropped. I wanted desperately to stop Nicole from talking but was
too far away. All I could do was listen in the same sense of fear
and dread as I imagine Sam was.</p>
<p>"You mean nothing to me. You were just a challenge, a game
to play. You were a fun fuck, hon. And not a very good one at that,"
Nicole laughed as snickers started to rumble through the room. "I've
had better. Honestly, I've done better solo with just these," she
flashed her expensively manicured fingers at Sam who was by now
painfully red in the face.</p>
<p>I just wanted to rush over and envelop her in my arms and
protect her from the pain Nicole was gleefully inflicting. Keep the
evil words from ever reaching those delicate ears. Or perhaps bash
Nicole over the head with a lunch tray, whichever was more
convenient. But I'm struck at that moment by my absolute
powerlessness. And I think that hurts almost more than anything else.</p>
<p>"But?" Sam managed to choke out, stunned as she was by
Nicole's admission. Nicole, who I truly believe now to be some sort
of Satan spawn, simply waved her off with one hand.</p>
<p>"You're not listening, McQueerson," she snickered at her own
bad joke. "I PLAYED you and you fell for it. You're so desperate for
any sort of affection that you jumped at the chance to be with
someone, anyone even if it was someone who used to be your worst
enemy. I fucked you over royally, kid. Figuratively and literally.
Welcome to the real world." Nicole smiled a sick, cruel smile then
and leaned in closer to poor stunned Sammy.</p>
<p>"How does it feel to know that the first person to ever touch
you, make you pant and moan, HATED you from the get go? USED you for
amusement and a quick fuck? It was all a game, Sam. And you lose."</p>
<p>Sammy, proud, stubborn Sam who was red in the face and
mortified, refused to let Nicole see how badly she was hurt by those
words. The tears threatened to fall but only hovered at the edge of
her dark lashes as she looked at Nicole in both utter hurt and
complete rage. Then, without a sound, Sam fled the room with one
hand over her mouth, trying not to be sick in front of the school's
populace as the words struck home.</p>
<p>I was sick too as Nicole laughed, I mean LAUGHED at Sam's
retreating form. She had truly amused herself with her little game.</p>
<p>"Run, Sammy!" she called mockingly after Sam. "See how far
you have to run to find your self-worth!" she giggled. She then
looked at her audience, still watching her with rapt attention.</p>
<p>"Now that, boys and girls, was more than worth the work it
took me to get her," she smirked, making my stomach flip-flop even
more.</p>
<p>"Why?" I heard myself ask. Nicole spun on me like a dervish
on crack.</p>
<p>"Ah, Brookie, to teach the little freak a lesson," she said
simply. "Don't you get it?" At my numb shake of the head, Nicole
sighed.</p>
<p>"Sometimes, B, you're as clueless as she is," she accused. I
felt my anger overtaking my shock. "First off, she needed to learn
her place in the scheme of things. She will ALWAYS be less than us,
Brooke. She needs to know that. WE can have her or make her do
whatever WE want whenever we want because of WHO we are." </p>
<p>Is it just me or was Nicole coming across as insane?</p>
<p>"And second, I'm not blind, hon. Sam is fiiiine. I wanted a piece of
that so I got it. I saw something I wanted and I took it."</p>
<p>She was making her sound like a sweater on sale at Saks.</p>
<p>"First taste too, lucky me," she licked her fingers in a grotesque
fashion to illustrate her point. </p>
<p>My fist connected with Nicole's face before I knew I'd thrown the
punch. My next two punches were hard hits to her body as she doubled
over. I later lied and said I didn't remember doing it, but I did.
Clearly.</p>
<p>This may sound sick, but it was a delicious feeling to inflict that
pain on her like that, in front of a room full of our peers. A tit
for a tat, I guess. </p>
<p>I saw her lying there, the room shock silent and still and I was
proud. I defended Sammy in some way when she couldn't do so for
herself. It's one of my proudest moments.</p>
<p>"Bitch," came out of my mouth in more of a growl than any
recognizable form of my voice. "You did that to get at ME and we both
know it." Nicole smiled through her bloody nose and STILL managed to
look superior. Smug bitch.</p>
<p>"Hell yeah," she wheezed. "I win."</p>
<p>My rage was hot and red and I swear I wanted to kill her. If not for
the 300 plus witnesses, I might have. Instead, I gave her one last
heartfelt kick and ran after Sammy.</p>
<p>It wasn't hard to find her, following her sobs down the hall into the
Novak. They were more wails than sobs, really. Banshee wails that
still haunt me now, a few weeks later. I've never heard such cries
of suffering coming from anyone in my life. I pray to never hear
them again, especially from Sam.</p>
<p>"Sam, are you all right?" I asked softly. I knew it was a stupid
question the second it left my lips. </p>
<p>She looked up at me from her place on the floor in front of
one of the toilets, flushing the evidence that she'd been physically
ill from sight and glaring at me. Her eyes red and puffy, tears
streaming down her face in rivers and soaking her shirt collar as
they ran down her neck. Those deep brown pools, so often in the
recent past lit up in mischief and delight were now a picture of open
devastation and raw anger. It blew me back a few steps.</p>
<p>"Am I all right? Are you fucking insane, Brooke?" she
screeched, her voice raw and scratchy from crying.</p>
<p>"Sam, I?I?"</p>
<p>What does one say to that?</p>
<p>Ever notice my habit of stammering when I could REALLY use my
verbal skills? Some captain of the debate team I am.</p>
<p>She stood up and started to pace wildly, making me nervous in
her excited energy.</p>
<p>"A `fun fuck'? A FUN FUCK! She USED ME! TOOK what she
wanted and now I'm yesterday's news. To hell with anything I might
feel. She never felt shit. Just strung me along until she could get
into my pants and now, `see ya later, Sam'." I let her rant, hoping
it would help.</p>
<p>She paced around the room, finally stopping at the mirror
where she stared at herself for several long awkward minutes. I
didn't know what to say. Plus I knew anything I could say would only
set her off again. So I watched her stare at herself with such a
powerful look of self-loathing that it broke my heart. She hated
herself in that moment and that's something I never wanted Sammy to
feel. I'm familiar with that place and I don't want Sam knowing that
darkness.</p>
<p>"I let her," she whispered, hanging her head. "I GAVE it to
her?" She looked back at her reflection; the red eyes, the wild hair,
the look of absolute defeat looking back at her.</p>
<p>"I didn't want to?but I LET HER!" She punched at the mirror,
shattering it into millions of pieces, making me jump, and splitting
open her hand.</p>
<p>"Aw, Sammy?" I sighed, hating to see her in more pain. </p>
<p>She suddenly turned to face me and I swear her eyes almost
seemed to glow red.</p>
<p>"I bet you were in on the whole fucking thing," she hissed
and my stomach clenched as I realized she was going to blame me. I
had given her my `permission' to date Nicole. That was bound to make
me look guilty.</p>
<p>"Sam, no, I?"</p>
<p>"LIAR!" she screamed, making me flinch and cower somewhat.
Being the sole recipient of that much rage is frightening. This was
not my sweet Sammy and I couldn't blame her in the slightest.</p>
<p>"You helped put her up to this. All you've ever cared about
is making sure that `I got mine'. Well, I hope you're happy,
McQueen. I'm broken. Game over, you win."</p>
<p>"Sam?" I tried to protest. She let out a short bark of a
laugh that sent chills down my spine.</p>
<p>"All that time?all those talks with me. I thought we had
gotten closer. I thought we HAD something really special, Brooke. I
thought maybe, if this didn't work?maybe you?aw shit?you PLAYED me
better than SHE did. Fucker! I HATE YOU!" She shoved me roughly
into the door of a nearby stall, bruising my back. The grip she had
on my upper arms was painful but I knew that it wasn't Sam reacting
this way. It was what Nicole had done to her. </p>
<p>I didn't fight back, willing somewhat to take whatever punishment she
wanted to dish out if it made her feel better. But she only stared
at me intensely for a few minutes. I could feel the blood from her
cuts seeping through my shirt and I wanted to help her but I daren't
speak. Then she released me with a growl, jerked open the door and
fled faster than I could follow. Besides, my feet were rooted to the
floor by shock and my own pain.</p>
