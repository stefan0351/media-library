<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Thirty One -->

<p>Sam lay on the couch in the fetal position, with her knees pulled up against her chin moaning. She felt like she was being eaten alive from the inside out and it was sheer agony. As per the doctor's instructions, she was eating only the blandest food Brooke could cook for her, chicken noodle soup, crackers and cream of wheat. She was so bored with white colored tasteless food.</p>
<p>"Time for your medicine, Sammy," Brooke announced walking into the room. She handed Sam her Prevacid and ginger ale, making sure that the brunette took them dutifully.</p>
<p>"Wound yourself up pretty tightly, there, didn't ya?" Brooke scolded lightly as she ruffled Sam's hair. Sam sent her a glare.</p>
<p>"A lot of teens my age develop pre-ulcerous conditions," she retorted. "This is nothing special." Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"OK, Sam, if that's how you want it," she nudged Sam's shoulder. "Scoot up." Sam did so and Brooke lowered herself onto the couch behind Sam, kind of like a live body pillow. Sam leaned back against her and tried to relax.</p>
<p>"Any news from the parentals?" she asked as Brooke played idly with her hair.</p>
<p>"Not yet. They've been shut up in their room since they got home earlier. They sure were upset about something. I hope it wasn't anything we did," Brooke said mildly concerned. Sam shrugged.</p>
<p>"Well, either way, we'll hear about it soon enough," she pointed out. She rested her head against Brooke's chest and sighed.</p>
<p>"Why do you keep everything so bottled up inside, Sammy?" Brooke asked quietly. "You always have. I remember when your dad died, you were barely out of school a week. And when you did come back, you wouldn't talk about it. You kept saying that you were fine and just sort of moved on," she said gently.</p>
<p>"What a shitty thing for you to remember," Sam snorted derisively. </p>
<p>"No, Sam, it's an important thing for me to remember. It's part of you. You kept telling everyone how everything was fine but I saw the lost and lonely look in your eyes. The grief that was there. I STILL see it so clearly even after all this time. I never really understood that haunted look in your eyes after I woke up but I think I do now," Brooke whispered.</p>
<p>"No, I seriously doubt you do, Brooke," Sam snapped although her voice lacked any strength. Brooke tightened her hold around Sam's middle.</p>
<p>"I think I do. First, it started when you lost your father. That look was the look of a little girl who missed and needed her daddy. And then, over time, that became fear; fear of ever being hurt like that again. So you closed yourself off and wouldn't let anyone get near your emotions. But then you fell for me. Hard and beyond your control. That look became one of knowing that what you wanted you could never have. That's why it had faded somewhat lately. Because you know that I DO love you. And it's also why it's come back. Because of your fear over what's happening at school."</p>
<p>"Brooke, can we just forget this? I'm tired and don't fell well," Sam pleaded. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, it's because you don't confront these things that you're sick now. You swallow all that pain and anger and it festers. You HAVE to let it go."</p>
<p>"This from the girl who used my jaw as an outlet," Sam sneered. "Hypocritical much?" Brooke didn't respond, instead grew very quiet. Sam, figuring she'd won the 'argument' settled back down in the warm lap. Soon though, she felt the fine tremors coursing through Brooke's body and realized that the blonde was silently crying.</p>
<p>"Oh crap, Brooke, I'm sorry," she apologized, instantly hating herself for her cruel thoughtless words.</p>
<p>"Why did you have to throw that in my face, Sam? I still feel horrible about what I did," Brooke sobbed openly. "Throwing back at me out of spite is mean and unfair."</p>
<p>"Brooke?"</p>
<p>"God, Sam, how do you think I feel seeing that little mark on your lip every time I look at your beautiful face; knowing that I'm responsible for putting it there? I know my anger is the reason you're scarred. What do you think it is I'm trying to avoid?" she cried. Not knowing what else to do, Sam turned in Brooke's arms to hold the upset girl and try to comfort her.</p>
<p>"I am so so sorry that I said that," she soothed. "You're right, I was wrong to use it against you. I'm sorry." Brooke only sniffled at her so Sam tried again.</p>
<p>"Brooke, honey, I don't mean to bottle this stuff up, I swear. I just?I don't know HOW to express it, how to deal with it. So I internalize it and hope that it'll just go away. And usually, after time, it does. I just sorta move on away from it. I don't know why this time is different?" her voice trailed off as she felt Brooke kiss the top of her head.</p>
<p>"Because you love me and it bothers you that some people don't have faith in that love," the blonde explained for her. Sam looked up at the girl, amazed that Brooke understood so well.</p>
<p>"And I know this, Sammy, because it bothers me too. I hate that some people see my feelings for you as fake, created by you. I hate that you're made to be this horrible person warping 'poor brain damaged Brooke' into a mindless, sex slave pawn. So to an extent, I understand how you're feeling. I don't want you to cry or scream if that's not going to help you. Just?talk to me, Sammy, about what's bothering you. Please," she pleaded. Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"I'll?I can try, baby," she said snuggling closer.</p>
<p>"That's all I want. Sammy. I don't want you to be making yourself sick when you could be talking to me."</p>
<p>"Thanks Brooke," Sam said, kissing her lightly on the lips. Feeling that she'd managed to reach through Sam's pain and make her point, Brooke smiled back. </p>
<p>"You're welcome."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Girls, I think we need to have a family meeting," Mike said as he entered the living room. He startled Sam right out of a deep sleep making her jump. Brooke, who was only slightly dosing, hugged the momentarily confused girl.</p>
<p>"Shhh, Sammy, it's only Dad," she whispered.</p>
<p>"Oh," Sam yawned blinking the sleep from her eyes. Mike smiled at them as he and Jane sat down.</p>
<p>"Sorry, Sam. I didn't know you were asleep," he apologized sheepishly.</p>
<p>"S'OK," she mumbled. She and Brooke sat up, automatically distancing themselves. They still felt that 'discretion was the better part of valor' and were subtle around the parents.</p>
<p>"What's up?" Brooke asked. The look on her parents' faces was making her slightly uneasy. They looked apprehensive and yet oddly pleased with themselves.</p>
<p>"Well," Jane began. "We had an?interesting meeting with a few of your friends today. Nicole, Harrison, and Mary Cherry."</p>
<p>"Oh Christ," Sam breathed, instantly awake. Brooke watched her go frighteningly pale and unconsciously put one hand on her stomach.</p>
<p>"Oh no," Brooke moaned.</p>
<p>&lt;THAT can't be good&gt; she thought figuring the meeting ended with her and Sam being sent to opposite ends of the planet. She had no idea how Mike was going to react to their relationship and hearing it from the Three Stooges as opposed to herself and Sam had to have stung as well.</p>
<p>"It was interesting, I'll tell you that," Mike said. "A real eye-opener."</p>
<p>"Crap," Sam groaned, drawing her knees to her chest in pain. Unable to stop herself, Brooke put her hand on Sam's shoulder in comfort.</p>
<p>"Easy, Sammy," she cooed, in pain herself from just watching Sam flinch. Jane frowned.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, Sam? Are you sick?" she asked concerned. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"The doctor said she is one step away from a full blown ulcer," Brooke filled in their parents. "We went to the walk in center yesterday after she started throwing up. Stubborn ass."</p>
<p>"Shut up, Brooke," Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"Why didn't you say anything?" Jane wondered a little hurt that her daughter hadn't told her that she was in so much pain. Sam let out a huff of air.</p>
<p>"Because it's no big deal. I'll be fine," she bluffed but feeling like she'd drank gasoline and swallowed a lit match. "So, what did you talk about with those three fruit loops?" Mike, recognizing her need to change the subject, obliged.</p>
<p>"You two," he said simply. He reached over and pulled out the three envelopes he had 'borrowed' from Nicole. Silently he spread their content across the coffee table. Both girls paled further as they stared at the pictures.</p>
<p>"Is there anything you'd like to tell me?" he asked evenly. "Tell us?"</p>
<p>"Oh boy," Sam breathed. She put her head in her hands and tried to collect her thoughts.</p>
<p>"Well, really Dad, if you can't figure it out from the photos, I think you have issues," Brooke said quietly. Sam groaned, this time in disbelief at her girlfriend and sprawled out on the couch like she'd been shot. She figured she was just saving Mike time. </p>
<p>To both their surprise, Mike burst out laughing.</p>
<p>"Oh, come on, girls, give me a little more credit than that. I realize I'm a man but, really, I'm not stupid. I knew you two were in love before you did," he announced proudly. "And that's fine with me, with your mother and I. If you're happy, that's all that's important."</p>
<p>"Ug?" Sam choked on her response.</p>
<p>"Er?" Brooke wondered if she herself was having a shock induced stroke.</p>
<p>"So, what did Nic and the others want?" Sam finally managed to utter as she and Brooke exchanged stunned but relieved looks.</p>
<p>"To ambush us with these photos and the 'scandal,'" Jane even used her fingers to quote the word as she spoke. "Of your relationship."</p>
<p>"We sure burst THAT little bubble, didn't we, hon?" Mike smirked. Jane smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes. I think it'll be awhile before you have trouble from Nicole again. Oh and Mary Cherry is apparently on your side anyway. Or at least the side of, how did she put it?" She turned to Mike.</p>
<p>"'True luuuuuuuv, y'all,'" Mike supplied in a hideous Mary Cherry impersonation. Brooke and Sam started laughing.</p>
<p>"Yes, that was it," Jane laughed. "So no need to worry about her. Harrison, well, he's another matter."</p>
<p>"Yes," Mike agreed suddenly solemn. "He's a bit frightening. Over the edge, you might say. Have you two had any trouble with him." Sam started shaking her head ferociously no but Brooke disagreed.</p>
<p>"He hit her," she said.</p>
<p>"Broooooke," Sam whined. Jane's eyebrows shot to the top of her head and Mike scowled.</p>
<p>"What do you mean 'he hit her,' Brooke? Is that how you got that scar, Sam?" Jane asked. Brooke shifted uncomfortably in her seat for a second as Sam shot her a dirty look.</p>
<p>"Actually, I hit her first," Brooke whispered softly.</p>
<p>"Excuse me?" Mike said. "You did what, young lady? We do not go around hitting people. You may not remember, but it was not how you were raised and it CERTAINLY is not how you treat the person you love. Or are we wrong about how you feel towards Sam?"</p>
<p>"NO!" Brooke protested suddenly caught in her own mess and lost as to a way out. "I DO love her?I?"</p>
<p>"It was an accident," Sam interrupted. "Sort of."</p>
<p>"Sam, she either hit you or she didn't," Mike said flatly. Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"True, and she DID hit me. Hard. But the circumstances were extreme. We were fighting and she was angry. She wasn't sleeping, the amnesia was making her confused and it just got out of our control. We've talked it out and it'll never happen again. She swore to it and I believe her." Jane and Mike nodded.</p>
<p>"OK, we'll trust you because you are nearly adults," Jane said. "Don't let it EVER happen again, agreed?" Both girls nodded enthusiastically. "But what's this about Harrison hitting you?" Sam shrugged.</p>
<p>"In all fairness, I hit him first. He slapped me back," Sam explained.</p>
<p>"That's why she needed the stitches," Brooke added softly. She was staring at her hands ashamed when Sam reached over and grabbed her hands gently, drawing her eyes up.</p>
<p>"It's OK, love," she whispered to Brooke. "I forgave you, remember?" Brooke smiled slightly.</p>
<p>"Yes. Thank you Sammy," she whispered back.</p>
<p>"Well, maybe someone should tell his mother that he has this issue with you, Sam, and your relationship with Brooke," Mike pointed out. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"Nah, let's just leave him alone for a while. Give him time to work through it on his own." Both parents looked doubtful.</p>
<p>"It's up to you two. If that's how you want it, fine. But at the first sign that he's out of control, you tell us and we're calling his mother, understood?" Mike made clear. The girls nodded.</p>
<p>"We got it, Dad," Brooke told him.</p>
