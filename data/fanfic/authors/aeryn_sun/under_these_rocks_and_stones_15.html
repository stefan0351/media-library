<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Everyday is a Winding Road -->

<p>Brooke folded and packed her last shirt and placed it into her
suitcase, shutting the large piece of luggage with a heavy sigh. Leaving the
Palace had been hard, it was her childhood home but leaving L.A. altogether was
downright scary. She was 17, with no real life experience or idea what she was
doing and the same went for Sam, Nicole and Lily. They were literally making it
up as they went along and Brooke couldn't help but think they were about to make
a monumental mistake. </p>
<p>"Are you sure about this, Sam?" she asked, turning to Sam who
was quietly packing a few feet away. Sam shrugged and shook her head.
</p>
<p>"No, no I'm not," Sam answered honestly. "But do you really
want to give Mom and Mike the opportunity to ship one of us away?" Brooke
frowned. </p>
<p>"Do you really think they would?" </p>
<p>"They were ready to send me to Chicago, Brooke. What does that
tell you?" Sam walked over and enveloped Brooke in a comforting hug. "Look,
hopefully this isn't going to be a permanent thing. We'll take off for a while
and make them see exactly how far we're willing to go to stay together. Drive
home our point, as it were." </p>
<p>"But what about school? And money?" Brooke wondered. Sam
sighed although she knew they were valid concerns. </p>
<p>"We'll make up the work when we get back, or start at new
schools if it comes to that. And we emptied our accounts, we're going to max out
the cards in cash advances and Nic's going to get as much as she can. Stop
worrying, we'll be fine," Sam reassured her. But there was one more thing
bothering Brooke. </p>
<p>"What if they report us missing or as runaways?" Sam pondered
that one for a few minutes. </p>
<p>"I honestly don't know," she said. "I guess we'll just have to
deal with it if it happens." </p>
<p>"Sammy, this could get really complicated," Brooke pointed
out. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"It already is, Brooke," Sam clarified and Brooke realized she
had a point. "We're gay and in love; our parents have rejected us and turned us
out. I hate to say it but everything from here on out has got to be better."
Brooke rested her head against Sam's shoulder. </p>
<p>"I hope so, Sam. I really do." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Nicole squinted in the bright sunshine as they packed up the
last bit of their things into the car. She couldn't believe it had come down to
this. Not that she cared about leaving her family, they meant very little to
her, but she felt so bad for Lily. She knew this was hurting Lily really badly
and therefore it was hurting her. She hated seeing Lily in any kind of pain,
emotional or physical, and she couldn't help feeling guilty that Lily was in
pain now. Emotions were still new to Nicole, especially love and guilt. It used
to be that she blocked such things out but she didn't have such a luxary
anymore. Lily had seen to that. </p>
<p>Now she saw the pain on Lily's face and in her voice at what
was going on and it broke her heart to know that to some extent she was
responsible. If she had just kept her feelings to herself and never told Lily
how she felt and dragged Lily into this, Lily would be safe and happy. OK, still
pining over Sam so maybe happy was too strong a word but her mother wouldn't be
hunting her for her head like she was at present or treating the poor girl like
an alien. While love Nicole was able to handle and was happy to feel, the guilt
was turning her inside out and upside down. </p>
<p>Lily watched the frown on Nicole's face deepen and wondered
what was going on in her lover's mind. They were almost all ready to leave and
she knew that was bothering all of them but Nicole looked downright despondant
and that expression was extremely out of place on Nic's face. She walked up
behind Nicole and wrapped her arms around the blonde's waist. </p>
<p>"What's wrong?" she asked. Nicole sighed. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry," Nicole answered in a whisper. Lily frowned in
confusion. </p>
<p>"What for?" Nicole turned around and Lily was surprised to see
tears in Nic's eyes. </p>
<p>"I'm hurting you and causing so much trouble in your life.
This is all my fault," Nicole explained. Lily's confusion deepened. </p>
<p>"Why do you figure that?" she questioned gently. </p>
<p>"If I had just kept my mouth shut and left you alone, your
life would be like it was, Lil. You wouldn't be forced like you are now to run.
Your relationship with your mother would be like it was and you'd be happy,"
Nicole went on to tell her. Lily sighed, finally understanding. She shook her
head. </p>
<p>"Nic, YOU make me happy. And I would have come out to my
mother eventually. You didn't make me gay. You didn't cause this and I'm
`running' because my mother is making me. SHE'S forcing my hand here, not you,"
she reached up and stroked the side of Nicole's face gently. </p>
<p>"Niki, I love you and I'd run to the ends of the Earth to stay
with you," she went on as tears cascaded down Nicole's face. </p>
<p>"You love me?" Nicole repeated just needing to hear it. Lily
nodded with a smile. </p>
<p>"Yes. OK, sure, if you'd told me six months ago that I'd fall
in love with Nicole Julian I'd have hit you over the head with a frying pan,"
Lily joked. Nicole laughed which was the effect Lily wanted. "But now that I
know you, the real you, Nic, yes, I love you. Completely. I wouldn't change
anything. Well, accept maybe the car accident, that sucked." Nicole laughed
again. </p>
<p>"That did suck and it was scary as Hell. I was afraid I was
going to lose you just as I found you," Nicole agreed. "And I love you too,
Lily." Lily kissed her and hugged her tighter. </p>
<p>"Then stop feeling so guilty, Nic. It's not your fault and
we're in this together. Besides, it'll all work out, it has to," she said
hopefully. Nicole nodded skeptically. </p>
<p>"I hope for all your sakes, you're right, Lily." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The four girls climbed into the SUV and pointed the car east.
After deciding that maybe Sam wasn't the best choice for driver (to which she
raspberried them all), Brooke got behind the wheel and with no real plan,
started driving. The first hour or so of the ride was quiet with each girl lost
in their own thoughts but eventually the silence gave way to playful
conversation. </p>
<p>"You do realize that with me and Brookie here gone, that
leaves Mary Cherry in charge at Kennedy?" Nicole pointed out idly. Sam and Lily
shuttered as Brooke started to laugh. </p>
<p>"God, I'm glad I'm not there," Sam uttered in horror just
imagining it. </p>
<p>"I feel sorry for Carmen and Harrison," Lily said remembering
the friends they left behind and feeling a pang of regret. They never even said
good-bye. </p>
<p>"Can you see it, though? No one to reign her in. Good Lord, we
better not be gone long," Brooke snickered from the drivers seat. </p>
<p>"By the time we get back everyone will be talking with that
God-awful accent and wearing leather and anally electrocuted mink," Nicole joked
earning herself a glare and pinch from Lily. </p>
<p>"Eek, a whole populace of teenage Mini-Mary Cherry's. I might
not wanna go back," Sam shuttered. THAT was a mental picture she didn't need.
{Author's advice: don't go there. I wish I hadn't.} </p>
<p>"So, where exactly are we going?" Lily asked to change the
subject. Mary Cherry still gave her the hibby-jibbies. Brooke looked at her in
the rearview mirror and shrugged. </p>
<p>"I don't know. We just kind of figured we'd drive until we saw
something that caught our eye. If you see something, Lily, let me know and I'll
stop." </p>
<p>"Actually," Sam interrupted. "I need a pee break." Brooke
laughed. </p>
<p>"Big feet, small bladder," she kidded her love. Sam mock
glared at her. </p>
<p>"Oh, har har, Brooke," Sam huffed indignantly while crossing
her arms and pretending to be insulted. This made Nicole and Lily laugh harder
in the backseat. </p>
<p>"Me too," Lily piped up a few seconds later. </p>
<p>"That'll teach you to buy a 48 ounce Slurpee, won't it?"
Nicole teased. Lily stuck out her tongue, which was now bright purple from said
Slurpee. </p>
<p>"OK, there's a gas station up ahead. We'll stop there," Brooke
said. She pulled over and Sam and Lily ran to the ladies room as she and Nicole
refilled the gas tank. </p>
<p>"Well, this is a royal mess," Nicole remarked. Brooke sighed
and nodded. </p>
<p>"Yup." Nicole tilted her head and stared at Brooke for a
second. </p>
<p>"Do you really love Spam?" she asked softly. Brooke frowned
for a second before answering. </p>
<p>"Yes. With all my heart and soul. I wouldn't be here
otherwise. Do you really love Lily?" she countered. Nicole smiled. </p>
<p>"Yes, completely. There's no where else I'd rather be," she
responded. Brooke laughed slightly as she hung up the gas pump. </p>
<p>"Then I guess we're both in the right place," she said. "And
for the last time, Nicole, her name is SAM." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>They finally stopped at a motel a little while after nightfall
and took the last two rooms since they had no more double rooms left. Brooke and
Sam collapsed onto the bed together and giggled when it squeaked. </p>
<p>"Great, we got a squeaky bed. No nookie for us or the whole
building will know," Sam lamented. Brooke laughed and scooted further up on the
bed near the headboard. She shook the bed so that it banged into the wall. Sam
looked at her with a raised eyebrow. </p>
<p>"Nicole and Lily are right next door," Brooke whispered with
an evil grin. "Let's give them an earful," she teased. Sam's eyes got wide as
she caught on and she laughed. They both continued to shake and rattle the bed
making moaning and grunting sounds while stifling giggles and covering their
mouths with their hands. </p>
<p>Next door, Lily and Nicole were sitting on the bed staring at
the wall that separated their room from Brooke and Sam's in shock. </p>
<p>"They're like a pair of sex-crazed weasels," Nicole
complained. Lily laughed. </p>
<p>"Oh God, Brooke," filtered through the wall as the banging
grew louder and Nicole and Lily exchanged glances. </p>
<p>"Oh Sam!" </p>
<p>"I SO don't need to hear that!" Nicole wailed to Lily,
covering her ears. Lily laughed harder and banged on the wall. </p>
<p>"Knock it off you two, we know you're not really doing
anything!" she called. Nicole stared at her. "Too much giggling," she explained. </p>
<p>"Oh." </p>
<p>"Sorry! Couldn't resist!" Sam's voice came through the wall
while they could hear Brooke laughing hysterically in the background. Lily
rolled her eyes and cuddled up next to Nicole. </p>
<p>"Jerks," she muttered with a smile. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"That was fun," Brooke sighed as she hugged Sam to her. Sam
nodded. </p>
<p>"I wish I had a picture of Satan's face, I bet it was
priceless," she giggled. Brooke giggled with her. </p>
<p>"I'm sure it was," she agreed. Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"There's only one problem," she pointed out. Brooke raised her
head off the pillow and looked at Sam. </p>
<p>"What?" she asked confused. Sam smirked and tossed one leg
over Brooke's waist and straddled the blonde's mid-section. </p>
<p>"Now, I'm all worked up," Sam growled leaning in for a kiss.
Brooke placed her hands on Sam's hips to balance her. </p>
<p>"Mmmm, me too," she purred back. "What about those two?" Sam
shrugged as she slipped off her shirt with Brooke's eager help. </p>
<p>"Don't know, don't care," Sam told her as she eased Brooke's
shirt off. "Let them entertain themselves." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Anyone need to stop?" Lily asked from the driver's seat two
days and a state later. Nicole shook her head no. Brooke looked down at the
sleeping form in her lap and shook her head as well. Sam had been asleep for
over an hour and she didn't want to wake her. The four of them were settling
into their strange and nomadic journey and were actually enjoying themselves. It
was like a mini-vacation. If the circumstances surrounding their leaving weren't
what they were, they might really be having a great time. But the shadow of
their parents continued to cast a pall over them. </p>
<p>Sam and Brooke had both wanted to call Jane last night but
knew that by now Mike undoubtedly had a trace on the phone and if they did call,
they could expect the Marines at their doorstep in minutes. But if there was
anyone they felt was an innocent being swept along in the madness, it was Jane.
She seemed genuinely upset at the turn of events. Yes, she was shocked and upset
to learn that Sam and Brooke were gay and in love but she was probably going to
be able to get past her denial and see things for what they were, love and
devotion between two people. She was open-minded enough for that, all she needed
was time. But Mike, as well as Nicole and Lily's mother's, has stolen that
opportunity from her and Sam and Brooke felt bad for leaving without saying
good-bye. They both loved her deeply and hated hurting her this way. </p>
<p>Brooke felt doubly bad for poor Sam. Sam had lost her father
at a young age and never truly recovered from the loss. Sometimes, when she
didn't think anyone was home or could hear her, Brooke would hear Sam sobbing in
her room and knew she was crying for her father. And sometimes Sam would suffer
from minor nightmares reguarding her father that would wake Brooke now as well
and she would hold Sam until the crying stopped. So leaving Jane, the only
parent Sam had had for so long and was so close to was extremely traumatic to
the emotionally guarded brunette and Brooke knew it. Unfortunately, there was
nothing she could do to make the situation any better other than be there for
Sam now. </p>
<p>And she felt guilty that her father was essentially the
ringleader in all this mess. She seriously wanted to beat the man over the head
with a blunt object for what he was putting them all through. She wondered if he
called Nicole and Lily's mother and how that `therapy' session actually came
about but decided that it was a moot point and it was useless to dwell on it
now. She brushed some unruly brown hair away from Sam's sleeping face and
sighed, catching Nicole's attention. </p>
<p>"You're awful quiet back there," Nic pointed out looking over
her shoulder at the blonde in the backseat. Brooke gave her a wane smile.
</p>
<p>"Just thinking," Brooke responded. </p>
<p>"Dangerous habit," Nic warned dryly. Brooke laughed
humorlessly. </p>
<p>"I know. Can't be helped though." Nic nodded. </p>
<p>"I know. She sleeps like the dead," she said indicating Sam.
Brooke smiled and lovingly stroked the side of Sam's face. </p>
<p>"Not usually. She's a light sleeper in most cases. I think the
car ride is wearing her out," Brooke said. Lily looked at her in the mirror. </p>
<p>"It's getting kind of late. Think we should stop for the
night?" she asked. Brooke nodded and so did Nicole. </p>
<p>"Yeah, find a nice place with a vacancy or two and we'll put
up stakes for the night. Anyone have a clue as to where we are?" Nicole wondered
outloud. Brooke shook her head as she stared out the window at the rapidly
approaching darkness. </p>
<p>"Not a one," she answered. "Not California, I know that.
Halfway across Nevada maybe?" </p>
<p>"I think we need to discuss where it is we're going," Lily
said simply. "We can't just keep driving aimlessly like some sort of band of
teenage gypsies." </p>
<p>"Gypsies, tramps, and thieves," Sam murmured sleepily. Brooke
giggled. </p>
<p>"Go back to sleep, Sammy," she whispered. Sam yawned.
</p>
<p>"'kay," Sam whispered back before falling asleep again. Brooke
thought a minute. </p>
<p>"I've got an aunt in Austin. We could stop there for a while.
Figure things out," she suggested. Nicole looked at her dubiously. </p>
<p>"You sure she won't sell us out to your Dad?" she asked.
Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"She's my Mom's sister, not my Dad's. They HATE each other.
She'd welcome the chance to get one in on him, I think. We can call Jane from
here before we go to check up on her and be long gone before anyone catches us."
Nicole shook her head vehemently. </p>
<p>"I don't like the idea of you calling your Mom. They'll trace
us and be on us like white on rice, B. It'll give them a place to start
looking," she explained. Brooke sighed, knowing Nic was right. </p>
<p>"OK," she said reluctantly. She really wanted to call Jane.
"But eventually we are going to have to call home." </p>
<p>"I know," Nicole said. "But let's make them stew a bit longer.
Besides, we've got plenty of money and we're four fine young women. There's a
lot of fun to be had." Lily rolled her eyes and sighed. </p>
<p>"You're horrible, you know that?" she asked Nicole with a
half-smile. Nic smirked at her. </p>
<p>"That's why you love me," Nicole answered cheekily making Lily
laugh. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Deciding to splurge, they got a pair of rooms at a hotel and
enjoyed some creature comforts not always available in some other
establishments. Lily and Nicole treated themselves to the pool while Brooke
tucked the still groggy Sam into bed and hopped into the shower. She put the
water on hot and let it soak into her weary bones. </p>
<p>(Oh, I can see it now, ten years from now. Next on `Where Are
They Now: Brooke McQueen, former head cheerleader, homecoming queen, straight A
student and most popular girl in her class at Kennedy High) she thought to
herself. (She had it all, all her ducks in a row and all the ivy league colleges
clamoring for her attendance. Where is she now? In a run-down little shanty
somewhere on the outskirts of New Orleans. Her lover left her, she's all alone,
overweight with no one but a cat named Lemue for company. How the mighty have
fallen) she snickered and wondered where the sudden attack of self-doubt was
coming from. </p>
<p>"Is this a private shower or can anyone join?" Sam's voice
made her jump and she turned to see Sam standing half in and half out of the
tub. She smiled broadly at Sam as her self-doubt left as suddenly as it came. </p>
<p>"Oh, you can join," she said. "Definitely." Sam stepped into
the shower and reached for her and Brooke melted into Sam's embrace. </p>
<p>"Do you always talk to yourself in the shower, love?" Sam
asked as she soaped up Brooke's hair and lightly kissed Brooke's cheek. Brooke
frowned. </p>
<p>"Was that outloud?" Sam giggled. </p>
<p>"I mean, really. A cat named Lemue?" Sam went on as she rinsed
the soap out of Brooke's hair and massaged her scalp as she did so. She leaned
in close to Brooke's ear. </p>
<p>"And I'm never going to leave you," she whispered making
Brooke shiver. She pushed Brooke's wet hair away from her face and pressed their
lips together in a passionate kiss. She poured all her love, devotion and hope
into that embrace and it was all Brooke needed to be convinced of Sam's words. </p>
<p>"Thank you," Brooke whispered as Sam recaptured her lips. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Do you think we've made a mistake?" Lily asked suddenly as
she lay in bed with Nicole. Nicole blinked at her in surprise and frowned. </p>
<p>"No, do you?" Lily shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, but it just seems like this is harder on Brooke and Sam
than it is on us," she pointed out. Nicole wrapped her arms around Lily.
</p>
<p>"Don't lie, it's unbecoming. You're bothered a lot by this,
you miss your mom and are hurt by this whole thing. We're all in the same boat,
Lil. That's part of what makes in endurable. We all have each other." Lily
smirked. </p>
<p>"You sunk the boat a long time ago, Niki," she joked. Nicole
laughed. </p>
<p>"No, just jumped ship to a new and better one. It'll work out,
Lily. It has to. If I gotta go back there and beat the sense back into your
parents I will," Nicole reassured her. </p>
<p>"What about your Mom?" Nicole arched an eyebrow. </p>
<p>"What about her? Sure, I can beat her too but I think I'd
enjoy that WAY too much," Nicole said dryly. </p>
<p>"Nicole, that's not what I meant," Lily warned. Nicole sighed. </p>
<p>"I know. But that woman is never going to be sober enough to
even attempt to accept me so my priority is you, hon. Not her." Lily leaned over
and kissed her. </p>
<p>"You always make me feel so special," she whispered in awe.
Nicole smiled. </p>
<p>"You are. Someone should have always been making you feel that
way, Lily. I wasted too much time making you feel badly when all I really wanted
was this. You are special and I'm lucky to have you." </p>
<p>"Aw, now you're getting mushy," Lily joked as she wiped her
eyes. Nicole laughed. </p>
<p>"Ew, God, don't tell anyone, my rep will be ruined." Lily
shifted so that she was draping her body over Nicole's. She tugged at the bottom
of Nicole's nightshirt as she kissed Nicole again. </p>
<p>"I love you Niki," she whispered. Nicole helped her lift the
shirt over her head. </p>
<p>"I love you too, Lily." </p>
