<!-- High School Hell \ With Friends Like These -->

<p>The campaign of harrassment continued for the next week or so with each incident getting worse and worse. Neither girl could bring their cars to school for fear of it being vandalized, their lockers were repeatedly broken into and their stuff either taken or ruined and they were shoved and bumped into in the halls. Sam joked, rather lamely, that part of that last one was the jocks coping a cheap feel now that they were both off the market. Brooke didn't find it particularly funny. Truthfully, neither did Sam. And the school administrators didn't want to hear about it. Sam and Brooke were reluctant to tell their parents about anything other than the car incident just yet. They wanted to be treated as adults and this was a situation they were going to have to deal with throughout their lives so they wanted to handle it on their own now. </p>
<p>So now they sat, side by side in Chem class waiting for Bio Glass to start class and wondering, not for the first time, who decided that she would get to teach Senior Chemistry this year. Like having the pleasure of her company last year wasn't punishment enough, right? </p>
<p>"OK, listen up you ignorant, close minded, homophobic little assholes," the angry yet dulcet tones of Nicole Julian suddenly came over the school's intercom system. Sam and Brooke looked up in surprise, glanced at each other and then back at where Nic SHOULD have been sitting. Staring back at them was an empty seat. </p>
<p>"Uh-oh," Brooke breathed. She then glanced at Mary Cherry's seat and was dismayed to see it empty too. She looked at Sam who she saw had come to the same conclusion as well. </p>
<p>"Oh God," Sam moaned, rolling her eyes and then rammed her head on the desk. (Dear God, another coma would be REAL nice right about now)</p>
<p>"Oh, no," Brooke groaned, burying her face in her hands and shaking it, hoping that this was some sort of a horrible nightmare. </p>
<p>"Let's get one thing straight," Nicole continued, oblivious from the office of Sam and Brooke's mortification. "Whoever is carrying out their campaign of terror against Brooke McQueen and Sam McPherson better knock it off, because, revoked license or not, I will find you, hunt you down and dispose of you like yesterdays fashion honey." </p>
<p>"Miss Julian give me that microphone," another voice, apparently an administrator could be heard demanding. There was a screech of feedback and the sound of a scuffle. </p>
<p>"Hey! Hands off the merchandise, do you have any idea what this shirt cost? Of course not, you obviously bought yours at the last Ames big one-day sale. Mary Cherry, handle her, I'm not doe." </p>
<p>"'Course, Nic," Mary Cherry could be heard happily chirping.</p>
<p>"Where was I? Oh, yeah, if anyone is going to be running a campaign of terror against anyone, tootsies, it's gonna be me. What Brooke and Sam chose to do on their own time is their business. So for the last time, and this IS your final warning, you've got no lifelines left. Unless you wanna know first hand how Sam felt last spring, BACK THE FUCK OFF! Do I make myself clear?" There was another screech of feedback and then Mary Cherry's voice replaced Nicole's. </p>
<p>"Yeah, don' make us open a can a whoop ass on y'all!" </p>
<p>Bio Glass sauntered (can it saunter?) up to where Sam and Brooke were currently wishing that the floor would open up and swallow them and stood in front of their desk. </p>
<p>"Well, kiddies," he/she/it started, a hideously snide smirk on his/her/its face. "Since we all know about your alternative lifestyle choice, let me make a few things clear. 1) I will not tolerate any inappropriate touchy feely going on in my classroom. Is that understood?" Both girls, who were now bright, Baywatch bathing suit red nodded. </p>
<p>"Good. 2) I will let you sit together for the sake of not screwing up my seating chart provided that rule #1 is followed and you don't sit and make mooneyes at each other all year long. Understood?" Sam was sinking further in her chair and Brooke was about out of places to hide her face. They nodded again. </p>
<p>"I'm so glad you're paying attention." So was the rest of the class, probably the only time all year THAT was going to happen. "3) I have nothing against alternative lifestyles, girls, but keep it to yourselves. No one likes a flamer. Understand?" Sam had no doubt that Bio Glass knew plenty about `alternative lifestyles'. She nodded and so did Brooke. </p>
<p>"Good, as soon as Miss Julian, our little poster girl for Mother's Against Drunk Driving herself gets back from her little public service announcement, we'll start class." He/she/it walked away and back up to the blackboard and Sam turned to Brooke. </p>
<p>"Well, if we weren't `out' before, we are now," she hissed. Brooke groaned in emotional agony. </p>
<p>"Shoot me, just shoot me now," she begged. </p>
<p>"Shoot you? Let's shoot Nicole," Sam countered in an angry whisper. Brooke took her hand away from her face and looked at Sam. </p>
<p>"Sam, she's only trying to help. She's our friend." Sam rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Brooke, she's stabbed you in the back 300 billion times, ran me over with a car and just `outed' us over the school PA system. With friends like that?" Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"I know, I know," she wailed quietly in defeat as she buried her face in her hands again. She really wished she'd stayed in bed that morning.</p>
