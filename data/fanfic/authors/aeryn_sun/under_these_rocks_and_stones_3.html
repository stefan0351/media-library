<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Party of Three (at a Table for Two) -->

<p>"Morning Sam," Lily said happily in greeting. Then her eyes
settled on the tall lanky blonde trailing a few steps behind Sam and one eyebrow
twitched slightly. "Good morning, Brooke," she greeted a little less happily but
still friendly. Brooke noticed the change in voice inflection and inwardly
grimiced. (This is going to be awkward) she reminded herself. </p>
<p>Since `inviting' herself to breakfast, Brooke had been trying
to figure out exactly why she had done so and what it was she wanted. Her
subconscious mind had told her she wanted Sam and if last night's dreams were
any indication, she wanted Sam BAD but she still didn't know what to make of it.
Denial was such a funny thing. </p>
<p>("You've had your groove on for Sam McPherson since before
you knew what the groove was for.") her subconscious had told her. She had
vehemently denied it. But then, she had still walked right through that open
doorway in her dream into Sam's room and made love to the girl. That, coupled
with the conversation she had accidently overheard between Sam and Lily:
</p>
<p><i>((("Brooke," Lily whispered in awe. "You're in love with
Brooke." </i> </p>
<p><i>"That's not something you keep throwing in someone's face,
Lily," Sam snapped. </i> </p>
<p><i>"But you can never have her, huh?" Lily asked quietly. </i>
</p>
<p><i>"Unless you know something I don't, no," she tried to joke but
it fell flat. "Brooke's waiting for Mr. Right, not Ms. Maybe who also happens to
almost be her stepsister."))) </i> </p>
<p>It was all serving to severely confuse and befuddle Brooke,
and she hated being confused or befuddled. And she realized her life had just
taken on a whole new set of complications. She wasn't sure she was ready to
handle it just yet. </p>
<p>"Hey, Lily," Sam said as she slid into her seat in the
restaurant. </p>
<p>"Hi, Lily, I hope you don't mind me tagging along with Sam
this morning," Brooke said as she too sat down. Lily shook her head. </p>
<p>"Nah, besides, Carmen would have been here but she's still in
bed," she explained. Sam smiled. </p>
<p>"Up late doing homework?" she asked as she played with the
salt shaker. Both Lily and Brooke found it cute the way she fidgeted. Only one
of them figured the other thought so too, of course. </p>
<p>"So she said when I called. I think she stayed up watching the
Danielle Steel movie marathon on Lifetime, myself," Lily laughed. Brooke and Sam
giggled as the waitress brought over menus. </p>
<p>"Hmm, what form shall my food poisoning take today?" Sam
wondered outloud as she looked through the menu. She peeked over the menu at
Lily. "And please, Lil, no lectures on how eating bacon is evil or anything
today. I didn't sleep well and I'm not up to it." Lily gave a small glare over
her menu and then went back to reading it and Brooke frowned. She looked at Sam. </p>
<p>"Sam?" Sam turned to look at her, a confused look on her face. </p>
<p>"What?" After a second, Sam realized what Brooke was thinking.
She blushed and lowered her voice. "That's not why I didn't sleep," she
whispered quietly, embarrassed. Brooke sighed in relief. The thought that her
rather vivid dreams had kept Sam awake was frightening to say the least.
</p>
<p>"Then why not?" Brooke asked genuinely concerned. Sam gave her
a half smirk. </p>
<p>"Got a lot on my mind. Don't worry about it. I don't anymore,"
she answered rather cryptically. Brooke wondered what she meant although a small
part of her thought it knew. </p>
<p>"Ready to order?" the waitress asked. After placing their
orders there was an odd anxiety level at the table. Brooke figured it came from
the fact that Lily was sitting at the table with the woman she loved, i.e. Sam
who was sitting at the table with the woman she loved, i.e. Brooke who was
sitting with the woman she at least fantasied about, i.e. Sam. (Yeah, that might
account for some tension) Brooke mused. </p>
<p>"So, Brooke, how've you been?" Lily asked trying to jumpstart
the conversation. It seemed like a good place to start seeing as how she didn't
talk to Brooke as much as Sam did. Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"OK, I guess. You know, same old, same old. Trying to keep
Nicole from burying the knife too deeply in my back," she responded with a wry
grin. Both Lily and Sam stared at her in shock. The grin grew wider. "What? You
think I don't know what she does behind my back? Please. Natural blonde is not
synonymous with brain dead," she pointed out. Sam stared to laugh. </p>
<p>"Guess not," she snorted. Lily giggled. "Guess Satan isn't
getting away with as much as she thinks?" Brooke shook her head. </p>
<p>"Hell no! I'm just letting her think she is until she gets
comfortable and then I'll pull the rug out from underneath her. I haven't spent
all this time around her and learned nothing, you know." They laughed a little
at this and then Lily asked another question before she could stop herself. </p>
<p>"So, Brooke, any new hotties on your radar?" Sam shot Lily a
look that was at once hurt and menacing. Lily sunk a little in her chair and
wished for all the world to take the question back. Brooke jumped a little at
the personal question and heard the small almost inaudible and wounded gasp that
came from Sam's side of the table. She also noticed how Lily seemed to shrink
several inches in her seat, which was amazing since she wasn't very tall to
begin with. (Sam must have really glared at her) Brooke figured. </p>
<p>"Well, a few guys have asked me out," she admitted. She heard
another pained and ill-hidden sigh from Sam and it made her chest hurt. She
shoved the reason why it hurt to the back of her mind and continued. "But I
turned them down. I'm not ready to play another round of the `Dating Game' just
yet." </p>
<p>"Well, I'm sure the guys will be sorry to hear that," Lily
added trying desperately to ignore both the look she was getting from Sam and
the fact that her mouth seemed to have a mind of its own. (Open mouth, insert
foot, Lily. Are you trying to hurt Sam?) Lily asked herself confused as to why
she started asking the questions to begin with. She knew that they must be
hurting Sam, rubbing her nose in the fact the Brooke was straight and Sam could
never have her but maybe if she could make Sam see that? </p>
<p>"Whatever, I think they'll survive," Brooke laughed. "I think
I'll just wait until the right person comes along instead of leaping into a
relationship just for the sake of having one," she explained. </p>
<p>"I'm sure the right guy will come along," Lily assured her.
(SHUT UP) Lily shouted at herself when she saw the hurt and offended look on
Sam's face. </p>
<p>"Trust me, I can wait," Brooke laughed nervously, catching the
increasingly anxious vibe from Sam's end of the table. (Please change the
subject, Lily, before poor Sam explodes or something) Brooke begged silently.
Sam pushed her chair away from the table awkwardly. </p>
<p>"I gotta hit the ladies room, be back in a sec," she said as
she headed away. Lily and Brooke watched her leave. Brooke sighed at the whole
exchange and then decided to play Lily for some info. </p>
<p>"Lily, something's up with Sam lately and I know she's more
apt to talk to you than me so, do you know what's up with her?" she felt
slightly guilty at playing Lily like this but she couldn't help herself. It was
the same impulse that invited her to breakfast. Lily looked momentarily
panicstricken. </p>
<p>"Uh, no," she stuttered. "We haven't been talking much."
Brooke frowned. </p>
<p>"Yeah, I noticed that you two had grown apart lately. I guess
this breakfast means you've fixed whatever it was between you?" Brooke felt a
little bad that she asked that since she already knew that they had but she had
to keep up appearances. Lily nodded. </p>
<p>"Yup, we straightened it out," (Ironic chioce of words) they
both thought. "We're cool again." </p>
<p>"Great. But you don't know what's bothering her lately?"
Brooke asked again. Lily shook her head although she really did. But she didn't
feel it was her place to say. (Ah, gee Brooke, yeah, Sam's deeply, madly in love
with you. Ha! Brooke'd probably faint. Plus I want a camera handly if she ever
finds out) Lily snickered morosely to herself. </p>
<p>"Afraid not," she lied. "You know Sam, she doesn't let anyone
get too close." (Oh, I can't believe I'm about to say this. When did I contract
Harrison's martyr syndrome?) "Why don't you talk to her, Brooke? Maybe she'll
talk to you," Lily felt her heart break as she spoke. While she doubted Sam
would actually tell Brooke the truth that she was in love with the blonde, there
was always the chance. And Lily knew that until Sam knew for sure where she
stood with Brooke, she would never stand a chance at winning a place in Sam's
heart. </p>
<p>"I suppose I could try," Brooke agreed but she had not real
intention of doing so until she figured out exactly what was going on in her own
head. "Maybe I will later. I wonder what's taking her so long in the bathroom?" </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam was desperately trying to stop from shaking. It was just
that Lily's out of character and insensitive line of questioning had left every
nerve ending raw and aching. (Rub some more salt into the wounds, Jesus, Lily)
she thought angrily. (I already know what I CAN'T have, why did you have to rub
my nose in it?) She stared at her reflection staring back at her and wished to
give anything to have been part of what Brooke was dreaming about last night. </p>
<p>(Yeah, give it up, McPherson) she scoffed. (Like you'd ever
get the chance to touch her like that, make her moan like she did last night)
She ran some cold water and splashed her face and decided to end that line of
thought before she worked herself up any further. (God this is so screwed up.
I'm at breakfast with the woman I love, Brooke. Who doesn't know I exist other
than maybe as a friend and stepsister. And at the other end of the table is Lily
who's admitted to being in love with me. I feel like I'm on a bad gay soap opera
and someone stole my script. God, what can go wrong next? Forget I asked or else
RuPaul will come marching in in a hula skirt singing `I Will Survive')
</p>
<p>She wondered, again, what possessed Brooke to want to come to
breakfast but pushed the reasons away, chalking it up to the cheerleader wanting
some friends that were unlikely to stab her in the back the first chance they
got. Sometimes she wondered why Brooke stuck with Nicole and Mary Cherry as long
as she did given the way they treated her. Was she a glutton for punishment? But
then she realized that 1) Brooke was loyal almost to a fault and 2) Brooke
didn't know any other part to play than `Brooke McQueen popularity queen'. And
with that title came people like Nic and Mary Cherry. It was kind of sad
actually, in a pathetic sort of way. </p>
<p>"Did ya fall in?" Brooke's voice caused her to jump at the
sink and spin around. She smiled in embarrassment. </p>
<p>"Nope, on my way out now," Sam answered as she headed for the
door. </p>
<p>"Good, because food's up." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Breakfast was eaten mostly in silence with each girl caught up
in her own thoughts. </p>
<p>(I'm never going to have a chance if Brooke ever realizes what
she could have. I wonder if Brooke is gay? Nah. I mean, what are the chances?)
Lily </p>
<p>(Can my life get anymore complicated? Oh, God, forget I asked!
Why do I keep asking stupid questions today?) Sam </p>
<p>(Am I gay? Can I be gay? Do I want to be gay? Do I get a
choice? What would that do to my life? But according to my subconscious, I
always have been and have had a thing for Sam. Now what do I do?) Brooke
</p>
<p>Lily watched as Sam glanced at Brooke every few minutes and
tried to ignore the jealous pang in the middle of her gut at the small gesture.
She was pretty sure Sam wasn't even aware she was doing it. She saw the way
Sam's eyes lit up everytime she even glanced at Brooke and if the blonde spoke
to her the brunette would almost glow. (And I missed all this before how?) she
wondered. But now, because she was aware of Sam's feelings for Brooke, Lily
could see it plainly written on Sam's face. And in her eyes. </p>
<p>Sam, for all her emotional walls and barriers, was still an
expressive being and it all came across in her eyes. They sparkled whenever she
looked at Brooke and it used to be that Lily assumed that that fire was due to
the animosity between the two girls. (You know what you do when you `assume',
Lily) she told herself bitterly. Now it was plain to see that that wasn't the
case anymore, at least on Sam's part. Sam had fallen for the head cheerleader
and fallen hard. We're talking watermelon from the top of the Sears tower onto
the sidewalk hard and Lily felt her chest constrict and throat tighten at the
realization that her chances with Sam were slim to none while Sam's heart was
focused on Brooke. </p>
<p>Lily tore her attention away from the brunette that had stolen
her heart and focused on the blonde at the table. She nearly choked on her toast
at what she saw. Behind Brooke's hazel eyes was a flicker of something new,
something that Lily didn't want to acknowledge but couldn't deny. And it was
aimed at Sam. She felt her stomach fall to her feet and she wasn't hungry
anymore. That flicker in Brooke's eyes told Lily that there was something going
on in Brooke's mind whether the cheerleader was aware of it or not and if she
DID become aware of it, Lily would lose any and all chances with Sam. She sighed
heavily almost in utter despair, which brought her the attention of both her
breakfast companions. </p>
<p>"You OK, Lil?" Sam asked. Lily nodded and tried valiantly not
to cry. </p>
<p>"I'm fine," she lied. She looked into the concerned eyes of
her companions. "Really." </p>
<p>"Are you sure because you look upset," Brooke said
sympathetically. Lily glared at her suddenly which confused her. While it wasn't
a mean glare, it was full of hurt and jealousy. Sam noticed the glare too and
while it surprised her she figured it had to do with her confession for having
feelings for Brooke and turning Lily down the day before. </p>
<p>"I said I was fine," Lily snapped a little harsher than she
intended. </p>
<p>"Whoa," Sam breathed. "Calm down. No need to get all charged
up," she said with a rather pointed look at the young Latina. Lily understood
the look which translated roughly into (Green is not a good color on you,
jealous much?) and sighed again. </p>
<p>"Sorry, didn't mean to snap," she apologized guiltily. Brooke
watched the silent communication between the two and wondered what she missed. </p>
<p>"Don't worry about it, Lily," Brooke told her calmly. "No
offense taken." </p>
<p>"Thanks," Lily mumbled while going back to her toast. The
awkward quota at the table went up about three knotches. Brooke looked at Sam
and arched an eyebrow but all Sam could do was shrug in response. She honestly
had no idea what set Lily off all of a sudden. She was fine and then she wasn't.
Sam was beginning to wonder if maybe Lily was developing some sort of
manic-depressive disorder that only manifested itself when she was around. (Can
that sort of thing be induced by heartbreak?) she wondered dryly with a hint of
guilt. </p>
<p>Brooke went back to her bagel also wondering exactly what set
Lily off so quickly. It served as a nice distraction from her wandering thoughts
about Sam, which was good since that's almost all she could seem to think about
this morning. (I've never seen Lily wound so tightly or so snappish. She was
fine and then SNAP, bitch alert. I wonder why) she thought. But then Brooke's
mind had enough of the `Lily' distraction and went back to its main attraction,
Sam. (Oh, God, I gotta figure this out. I can't keep thinking in circles. Am I
gay, am I straight, am I bi? Do I want Sam?) She glanced at the taller of her
brunette companions who smiled back at her and she felt a strangely familiar and
yet unfamiliar flutter in her stomach, half-excitement, half something else and
part of her knew she was sunk. </p>
<p>(Oh, Christ, judging from the way my body reacts just from her
looking at me, plus the dreams I've had, I'd say yes, I do want Sam. But that
would mean that I'm gay and I don't know if I can handle that) she admitted to
herself. </p>
<p>Lily, who was seated across from Brooke, watched the myriad of
emotions play across the blonde's face in morbid fascination. First there was
concern, then consternation and concentration, followed by confusion, and then a
flash of desire and want when she looked at Sam. And Lily felt her heart break
again when she realized that Brooke did have something for Sam that she was
probably just beginning to figure out and gee look, she had a front row seat for
it, lucky her. After that there was a look of pure despair that broke Lily's
heart in a different way. She felt sorry for Brooke because she understood how
hard it was to come to terms with realizing that you don't meet society's
version of `normal'. And she was betting it was going to be doubly hard for
Brooke if she decided to accept it herself, being popular and having that role
to play. And if Brooke did accept it, than Sam was all hers. Lily felt the tears
threatening again. </p>
<p>"Excuse me," she said as she got up and headed to the ladies
room. After she left, Sam turned to Brooke in confusion. </p>
<p>"Is it me or did you miss an entire section of conversation
that only Lily was privy to also?" she asked. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Apparently so," she agreed. She'd noticed the smaller girl
watching her a moment ago and saw the tears in her eyes but didn't know what
they were for. "Tell you what Sam, you pay the check, I'll go check on her," she
handed Sam a ten and went after Lily. Sam threw her hands up in defeat.
</p>
<p>"Will someone please give me a clue? I left mine at home," she
grumbled to herself. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Lily was sitting on the floor of the bathroom crying when
Brooke walked in and found her. She sat down next to the smaller girl.
</p>
<p>"Oh, Lily, what's wrong?" Brooke asked softly. Lily sobbed
harder. Brooke rubbed the girl's back soothingly. </p>
<p>"You have no idea!" Lily finally burst out, climbing to her
feet. Brooke frowned and stood up as well. </p>
<p>"Of course I don't. You've had more ups and downs this morning
than a roller coaster ride. Plus I don't know you that well. I can't help if you
don't clue me in," she said calmly. Lily glared at her bitterly, a look that
Brooke found to be oddly out of place on Lily's normally friendly and open face. </p>
<p>"You could have it all. I mean, you all ready do, but you
could have so much more but you don't even see it," she hissed angrily. Brooke
scowled. </p>
<p>"Why are you so mad at me? What did I do?" (OK, so I know the
answer to that one. If I could just get her to say it, then I don't have to
admit to overhearing that conversation) Lily's glare actually got hotter.
</p>
<p>"You have no idea what's within your grasp and even if you did
you lack the courage to reach out for it!" Lily accused bitterly. Brooke was
insulted. Her eyes narrowed and her desire for a `nice friendly chat'
evaporated. </p>
<p>"What's `within my grasp', Lily?" she growled. Her hackles
were up now. Anyone watching would describe them as two cats with their hair on
end, hissing at one another. Lily grunted in frustration. </p>
<p>"I'm not handing it to you that easily, Brooke," she growled
back. "But it's something more special than you deserve and for the life of me I
don't understand why you're going to get it, why it wants you!" Brooke knew they
were talking about Sam but she wanted Lily to say the name first. </p>
<p>"What are you talking about? What is `it'?" she asked trying
to provoke the other girl. Lily shook her head and smiled grimly. </p>
<p>"If you can't figure that out on your own, you don't deserve
it," she informed Brooke hotly and arrogantly. "But first, you need to figure
out what it is you want, Brooke. You need to decide what's more important, your
precious image or what you want, your own happiness and someone else's. Can you
exist outside the box you let everyone put you in? Can you even think for
yourself or are you going to let Nicole and Mary Cherry do it for you for the
rest of your life?" Lily asked tauntingly. Brooke looked at her in shock.
</p>
<p>"This isn't like you, Lily," she pointed out, calming down
some. Lily wiped a few stray tears away. </p>
<p>"Yeah, well, you're in the way of what I want, Brooke. I'm
tired of being the nice one who lets everyone use her to get what they want. I
know what I want and I can't have it BECAUSE OF YOU!" she finished with a
scream. Brooke backed away from the raw pain in Lily's voice. </p>
<p>"Lily, I?" Brooke started but Lily cut her off. </p>
<p>"I'm not stupid, Brooke. And neither are you so cut the shit.
We both know what I'm talking about," Lily took a deep, calming breath. "Now,
figure out what you want, what you are, what you can and can not deal with and
then let the rest of us know so that we can move on with the rest of our lives."
Brooke stared at her open mouthed. Lily smirked. </p>
<p>"I've seen how you look at `it'," Lily said, unwilling to give
Brooke the satisfaction of saying Sam's name outloud. "You may not realize what
you want yet, but you'd better figure it out soon. I won't sit by passively for
long. I'm not known for my passiveness," she reminded the thunderstruck blonde. </p>
<p>"Lily, I don't know what I want," Brooke admitted softly. Lily
sighed. </p>
<p>"I know, that's the problem. You have to figure that out. It's
not fair to make us wait for you to iron out your `issues'." </p>
<p>"I'm scared," Brooke whispered. Lily reached for the door. </p>
<p>"Grow up," she rumbled roughly. "And grab on to the
possiblities that lay in front of you before they slip through your fingers,
Brooke. Because I won't make the same mistake and there are no second chances in
this life." Lily opened the door and walked out. After a few minutes thought,
Brooke followed her out. She found Sam sitting alone at the table looking more
confused than ever. </p>
<p>"What the Hell happened in there?" Sam asked. "Lily came
storming out looking like she'd just gone ten rounds with Layla Ali and then
left saying she'd see me at school. You don't look much better than she did. I
am SO missing out on something here." Brooke shook her head. (Now what?) Brooke
wondered. (To tell or not to tell) </p>
<p>"Tangled webs, Sam. Just the tangled webs," she explained
cryptically as they left the restaurant. Sam cocked an eyebrow in confusion and
wondered if she had a Brooke-to-English dictionary at home somewhere. (Oh, look,
my day did get worse) Sam told herself. (Where's RuPaul when you need him?) </p>
