<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Thirty Five -->

<p>Thanks to a spirited public relations campaign spearheaded by Mary Cherry without the girl's knowledge, things at school started looking up. Without Nicole to tell Mary Cherry how to act or what to say, she was working on her own doing what she wanted. And to Brooke and Sam's complete surprise, she wasn't doing anything distasteful. </p>
<p>Instead, Mary Cherry had started several informative clubs and a website to educate and promote tolerance within high schools, a la Once & Again. Already there was a lot of interest generated in the clubs and Mary Cherry reveled in being in control of it all. Sam and Brooke were content to let her do her thing. After all, they were the ones benefiting from it in the end.</p>
<p>Nicole was still skulking about in the shadows, bitter about her defeat at the hands of the McQueen/McPherson parents. But she was quiet, not raising anymore attention to herself than she had to. She wasn't stupid. She knew when she was beat. She even went so far as to quietly join one of the clubs in order to curry favor in the `popular' circle again. April Tuna overheard it when Harrison confronted her about it in the lunchroom and Nicole calmly responded:</p>
<p>"I'm on whatever side is winning, hon."</p>
<p>So, the big drama over, the talk turned to graduation that was fast approaching. So far, in spite of the accident, Brooke's grades still had her at the top of the class and accepted at UCLA. She wasn't sure what she was going to study but she was happy to at least be accepted.</p>
<p>Sam, whose grades weren't as good but were above average was accepted to Berkley as well as Columbia. She had decided, after a long talk with Brooke, to stay in California and stay close to her lover. It wasn't really a compromise. Sam decided that she really wanted to stay close to home near her mother and baby sister anyway. So everyone ended up happy.</p>
<p>However, one little thing was still a thorn in the girl's sides. Despite her warnings to the contrary, Harrison continued to leave gifts and little notes for Brooke every time she turned around. First, there was a teddy bear with a ruby bracelet wrapped around it that she found on her desk in Bio along with another cheesy love note. Then, a box of expensive chocolates was placed on the hood of her car with another note. And earrings to match the bracelet arrived at the Palace by a singing messenger one night after dinner. It reminded both Sam and Brooke of a devoted cat bringing its owner dead birds and mice as a show of love. It was kind of creepy.</p>
<p>"Brooke." Mike said, his tone holding a warning, advice, and not a small bit of concern. </p>
<p>"I know, Dad. I know," she sighed. "But what else can I do? I keep sending the stuff back to him. I keep telling him I'm not interested. HE'S just not listening. I mean, seriously, how many times can I say no? Once should be enough." A stifled scream came from the direction of the back door and brought Mike and Brooke running to Sam's side.</p>
<p>Sam was bent over something on the back step, a look of horror and surprise on her face. Mike reached past her and picked up a small stuffed rabbit that had been horribly mutilated.</p>
<p>"Sam?" he asked. She looked at him and shrugged.</p>
<p>"I came back from my run through the back and there it was. This was pinned to it," she said, handing Brooke a note. Brooke frowned and read the note out loud.</p>
<p><i>"Sam,</i></p>
<p><i>Stay away from Brooke. She doesn't want you. She doesn't belong with you. This is your only warning."</i></p>
<p>It was unsigned but there was no mistaking where the note or the rabbit came from.</p>
<p>"God damn, Harrison," Brooke growled, hugging Sam to her. She didn't like the implied threat to Sam.</p>
<p>"Poor bunny," Sam sighed. "His name is Tuggers. I gave him to Harrison for his seventh birthday. He always treasured that stupid thing because I earned the money for it doing chores," she went on to explain.</p>
<p>"We need to DO something about this situation. It's gone way too far now that he's threatening Sam," Mike said angrily. Brooke nodded sadly.</p>
<p>"'K, Dad. I'll go to his Mom tomorrow," she agreed. She felt a small tremor course through Sam and turned the other girl towards the house. "I'm gonna take Sam inside, OK?" Mike nodded and headed to the house himself and his den, mumbling something about `teaching Harrison a thing or two about respect'.</p>
<p>As soon as she entered the kitchen, Brooke sat Sam down in one of the chairs and got her a glass of cold water. She stroked Sam's hair, damp from her run, away from her face and kissed her temple in comfort.</p>
<p>"I'm OK, Brooke," Sam said quietly. "It just surprised me is all." Brooke buried her hands in Sam's hair.</p>
<p>"You sure, honey?" she asked gently. Sam smiled slightly.</p>
<p>"Yeah. It was just a shock, seeing that thing laying there," she sighed. Then she smirked. "At least it wasn't a REAL bunny and saying `the rabbit died' really MEANS that the rabbit died," she joked weakly. Brooke smiled knowing that Sam's main way of dealing with fear or hurt was to joke about it. At least she wasn't claming up and tuning Brooke out.</p>
<p>"It's just...Brooke, there's so much rage involved in what he did. There was hardly anything left of ol' Tuggers," Sam said softly. "Does he hate me that much? And what would he do to ME?"</p>
<p>"Sammy, I'm sorry he's done this to you," Brooke apologized guiltily. "That stuffed animal had sentimental value and he knew it. He used it to hurt you more and I'm sorry."</p>
<p>"It's not your fault, Brooke," Sam pointed out firmly. Brooke shook her head and sat down heavily next to Sam, resting her forehead against Sam's shoulder.</p>
<p>"In the long run it is. He wants me and he sees you as an obstacle to that. Maybe if I'd been clearer with him to begin with...maybe if I'd told him right away when you and I got together...maybe if I never dated him to begin with." Brooke trailed off with another long sigh. Sam tilted the blonde's downcast face up to meet her own.</p>
<p>"How much `clearer' could you have been short of tattooing it on your forehead or taking out an ad in the newspaper that said `I don't like you, Harrison John?" she asked seriously. "As for not dating him to begin with, well, we all make mistakes, Brooke. Count that as a big one," she smiled. "Besides, even if we did tell him straight off, he'd still have his homophobic issues. WE can't help that."</p>
<p>"You're right, Sammy," Brooke agreed after several quiet minutes. "But tomorrow, we go to his mother and tell her about all this." Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"Agreed, although I doubt it's going to be a pleasant task."</p>
<p>"Probably not. But she needs to know what's going on Sam," Brooke said thinking about how sad it was that they were going to have to tell Harrison's mother something so horrible. She hoped that she believed them.</p>
<p>"Sammy, what do you think his mom's going to do when we tell her?" she asked genuinely concerned. The last thing she wanted was to be on someone else's bad side. Sam shrugged.</p>
<p>"Robin's always been really cool about stuff. After the big mess when Harrison found out she was gay, she got really quiet though. But I don't think she'll believe that we're lying. We have no reason to and God, by now I think EVERYONE knows about us," she smirked, earning herself the smile from Brooke she was aiming for. "So, I think she'll believe us, given Harrison's already proven homophobic streak and stuff. From then on, we'll just play it by ear."</p>
<p>"Sounds like a plan."</p>
