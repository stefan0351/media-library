<!-- Connecting the Dots \ Part Two -->

<p>Sam hated the way her sneakers squeaked on the linoleum tile of the hospital floor as she ran. It echoed and served to remind her of the stark reality of the situation that she'd rather assume was a horrible fever induced nightmare. She knew she'd broken every land speed record known to man since her mother called her in San Diego to tell her of Brooke's accident. The incredibly expensive speeding ticket currently littering the floor of her car was proof of that. The only reason the cop hadn't had her car towed on the spot was he believed her story and she promised to go slower. Which she didn't but that was beside the point. </p>
<p>She'd never heard five more horrifying or life-stopping words than her mother's hushed `Brooke's been in an accident'. Upon hearing those dreaded words the rest of Sam's world had faded to black and white and dropped away. There was simply nothing else in existance but that phone line and her link to Brooke. She hated that she'd pushed the blonde away of late but her own pain and confusion had gotten the better of her. Never one good at emotional exchanges or dealing with her own emotional issues, Sam reacted like she always did and shut down. She shoved everyone away emotionally, especially Brooke who had gotten the closest, and slammed down her defenses. She regretted having done so and creating the gap between herself and Brooke as her mother outlined Brooke's condition. </p>
<p>"She's in critical but stable condition. The car hit a tree, Sam. She swerved to avoid a little girl. She's got some cracked ribs and internal injuries. The airbag probably saved her life. But, oh God Sam, her head hit the side frame of the car and there's head trauma. She's in a coma, Sam. You need to come home."</p>
<p>Well, that was a given. </p>
<p>"I'm on my way, Mom," Sam had said as she hung up the phone. She grabbed her keys and ran for her car. She hadn't stopped running since. </p>
<p>In the car she'd had plenty of time to think about what a mess she'd made of things. From the moment Harrison had announced Brooke's name like some sort of lottery winner Sam knew she'd been making her choices out of hurt and anger rather than what was right or logical. In fact, the only thing she could think of having done correctly was shove Brooke out of the path of Nicole's car. But even that, Sam admitted, was done for two very different reasons. </p>
<p>1.) She would never, ever want to see any harm come to Brooke if she could in any way prevent it; and
<br>2.) Some twisted dark part of herself had kind of hoped Nicole's car would hit her instead and put her out of her misery. </p>
<p>Self-defeatest, stupid, suicidal, and wrong she knew but Sam was bothered by so many things that a small part of her would have welcomed the respite. She would have gone out saving Brooke's life, a hero of sorts and would have been remembered as such. The part of herself that had adopted a bit of Harrison's martyr syndrome liked that idea. While the idea of suicide was independently repulsive to Sam, sacrificing herself for another was not. </p>
<p>But as it was they'd both survived with barely a scratch. Brooke must have said a thousand `thank you's' knowing how easily things could have turned out differently. But to Sam her reaction had been natural. No thanks were necessary. She'd have gladly done it a thousand times over if it meant Brooke would be all right. Brooke meant more to Sam than she could or ever would put into words, mostly because she didn't understand it herself. Then Brooke had started dating Harrison and for some reason even she couldn't explain, Sam's heart broke. And the more she watched Brooke and Harrison, the angrier she got so she pushed away. It was typical of her and she knew it. She hated that she did it but she was powerless to stop herself. </p>
<p>Honestly, she didn't know what bothered her more; Brooke dating Harrison or Harrison dating Brooke. Either way she had lost the two most important people in her life and lost them to each other. It left her feeling raw, alone and vulnerable. All feelings that Sam despised. So she converted them into what she was comfortable with, scorn and anger. And she took them out on Brooke. It was incredibly unfair of her but it was the only defense she had for the way she felt. In the long run, she felt betrayed by Brooke and that hurt a lot more than Sam cared to admit. </p>
<p>The gap between them widened, mostly because she shoved Brooke away. Letting the gentle blonde close was like pouring salt into an open wound. Rather than spend the summer watching Brooke and Harrison play lovey-dovey happy couple and make her want to gag, Sam leapt at the first opportunity to leave. It was a decision she regretted for more than one reason. She worked long hours at a rinky dink paper making no money and learning nothing because she was stuck doing scut work. And she missed Brooke to no end. Now she had let too much time pass and Brooke was lying in a coma. If Brooke never woke up, Sam might never get the chance to apologize or rebuild their relationship. And that cold possibility scared her. </p>
<p>She's been aware that something within her towards Brooke had changed but she couldn't exactly put her finger on what it was. All she knew was that she couldn't see her life without Brooke playing an important part in it. Sam had planned on coming home soon and trying to set things right with Brooke but now she worried that like always, she was a day late and a dollar short. She'd never forgive herself if this was how things ended between them. There was too much left unsaid, too much not figured out and she couldn't stand loose ends. She really didn't want to count Brooke among her outstanding regrets. </p>
<p>She reached Brooke's closed door in ICU and paused to compose herself. She wasn't exactly sure what awaited her on the other side of that door but she did know that it was going to rock her world to its foundation. With one last deep breath, Sam opened the door. </p>
