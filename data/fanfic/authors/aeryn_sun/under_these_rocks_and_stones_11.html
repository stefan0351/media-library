<!-- Under These Rocks and Stones \ Worst Moments -->

<p>"Whoa, glow alert," Sam said jokingly as Lily approached her car for a ride to school. Lily looked at her open mouthed and then blushed. </p>
<p>"I have no idea what you're intimating," Lily said haughtily as she got in the car. Sam burst out laughing. </p>
<p>"Li-ly got lu-cky," Sam sang. Lily gasped in embarrassment and blushed again while trying to hide her head in her hands. </p>
<p>"You have absolutely no tact, you know that?" Lily snapped. Sam kept laughing. </p>
<p>"So Brooke tells me," she snickered. "Hey, it's cool, Lily. If you care for Nic that much, as much as it's a disturbing thought, if it makes you happy, go for it." Lily looked at her dubiously. </p>
<p>"You're not just saying that?" Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Nope. I want you to be happy, Lily. And for whatever reason, Satan makes you happy. But why didn't you hitch a ride with her?" Lily sighed. </p>
<p>"Please don't call her Satan. And she had to leave to go change early this morning. Plus she had to pick up Mary Cherry and I'd rather ride tied to the roof of April Tuna's car than ride with that psycho." Sam chuckled her agreement. </p>
<p>"I don't blame you," she said as she pulled into traffic. Both girls were quiet for a few minutes. </p>
<p>"Strange, isn't it?" Sam asked. Lily looked at her confused. "Us, the two misfits are dating the two hot cheerleaders, I mean?" Lily laughed. </p>
<p>"Good point," she agreed. She looked up the road. "Sam! Look out!" Lily cried as a truck suddenly entered their lane and flipped onto its side. </p>
<p>"Shit!" Sam swore as she wrenched the wheel to the right and then the left as she lost control of the car. The car spun in circles on the asphalt as Sam fought for control before it flipped onto its side and rolled a few times. It crashed to a stop in the side of the jack-knifed truck with a loud bang. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>"Thanks for the ride, Nic. I can't believe my car wouldn't start," Brooke complained from the passenger seat. Nicole shrugged. </p>
<p>"Count your lucky stars that Mary Cherry is out sick or we'd have her pleasant company this morning too," Nic said cheerfully. Brooke looked at her best friend. </p>
<p>"You certainly have a particular glow this morning," Brooke chided noting the blush that came to Nic's cheeks as she spoke. </p>
<p>"Uh, new make-up?" Nicole lied badly. Brooke laughed.</p>
<p>"Nic," Brooke said knowingly. "I'm happy for you. I'm glad things are going so well with Lily." Nicole relaxed. </p>
<p>"I really love her, Brooke," she admitted. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"I know you do. And that's great," she was distracted from commenting further by a bottleneck up ahead in traffic. "Must be an accident. Do you see any emergency vehicles?" Nic shook her head. </p>
<p>"No, must have just happened," she answered as they reached the accident. A large truck was on its side with a compact car crushed up against it. Brooke's stomach dropped to her feet."OhmyGod," she uttered in horror. Nic glanced at her and saw that Brooke was white as a ghost. </p>
<p>"What?" she asked alarmed. </p>
<p>"Oh God, pull over. That's Sam's car," Brooke said, her fear and terror leaking out through her voice. Nicole felt the bile rise to her throat as she pulled the car over. </p>
<p>"Shit, Lily was hitching with her," she whispered. Both girls exchanged worried glances before exiting the car. They approached Sam's car and could see both occupants were unconscious. Nic pulled out her cellphone and hurriedly called 911. Brooke walked to Sam's side of the car and willed herself not to vomit when she saw Sam. The car was on its side with Sam's side against the ground so the only way she could get to Sam was to get on the ground near the shattered windshield. Sam was cut up pretty bad, lying there limp and Brooke couldn't even tell if she was breathing. </p>
<p>"Sam? Sammy can you hear me?" she banged on the window for effect. Sam didn't move but Lily did. </p>
<p>"Brooke?" Lily called out weakly. Nicole had reached the car by now and climbed up to Lily's window. </p>
<p>"Brooke and Nicole," she said softly as Lily's eyes fluttered open. She had a gash on her forehead and a few bruises but Nic couldn't see anything else wrong from where she was. But she knew there was probably more. Lily smiled weakly. </p>
<p>"Niki," she whispered making Nic smile. "What happened?" </p>
<p>"You and Sam have been in an accident. Don't worry, you're going to be fine," Nicole said more to reassure the both of them than anything else. Alarm flashed across Lily's features. </p>
<p>"Sam!" she gasped and turned her head to where Sam still sat unmoving. Lily could see Brooke through the window trying to get Sam to wake up. She reached out a weak arm and felt for a pulse in Sam's neck. Brooke watched anxiously. </p>
<p>"It's beating, Brooke," Lily called out. "But it's weak," she added sadly. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"That's it, Sammy. Stay with me," Brooke spoke to the unconscious girl. Suddenly Sam stirred. </p>
<p>"Br...ke?" she stuttered. Brooke let out a sigh of relief. </p>
<p>"Here Sam, right here," she spoke through a hole in the window. Sam's eyes opened for a moment and then shut again. </p>
<p>"Li...ly?" </p>
<p>"Here Sam," Lily answered the unspoken question. Sam let out a sigh. </p>
<p>"Sor...ry," Sam said quietly. </p>
<p>"Not your fault, Sam. It's OK," Lily told her. Sam didn't answer. </p>
<p>"Sam?" Brooke called. "Sam?" her voice became more insistant but Sam didn't stir again. Before panic could overwhelm Brooke, the paramedics arrived. </p>
<p>It was an easy task to remove Lily and she was whisked off to the hospital with Nicole by her side fairly quickly but they needed the Jaws of Life to get Sam out. And that cost them time. Brooke stood by in silent agony as they removed Sam from what remained of her car. She was still unconscious and ghastly pale. </p>
<p>"Are you with her, miss?" a paramedic asked Brooke. She nodded. </p>
<p>"Yes, she's my stepsister," Brooke responded on automatic pilot. The EMT motioned for her to climb in the ambulance. She jumped in with him and stared at Sam's frighteningly still form. </p>
<p>"How is she?" Brooke asked quietly. The EMT looked at her sadly. </p>
<p>"She's holding on. But she's unconscious and that's never good. But we'll know more once we get to the hospital," he told her. </p>
<p>"I understand," Brooke told him. (Please be OK, Sammy. I just got you in my life, I can't lose you now) </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Nicole paced the waiting room frantically, somewhat resembling a tiger confined to an 8x8 cell. They'd taken Lily in a while ago but she still hadn't seen Brooke or Sam. She was worried, distraught actually. Lily was hurt and there was nothing she could do. Nicole felt powerless and it was a horrible and unfamiliar feeling. She wanted to know what was going on with Lily. Was she OK? Was she badly hurt? Where was she? The questions were slowly driving Nicole insane. She looked up when she heard the ER doors open and saw the paramedics wheeling Sam in and Brooke trailing behind. She ran to Brooke's side. The other blonde looked stricken. </p>
<p>"Brooke, how is she?" Nic asked as the doctors took Sam through the doors where Brooke and Nicole couldn't follow. Brooke looked at her blankly. </p>
<p>"She's still out cold and I guess that's bad," she responded numbly. Nicole hugged her and found that Brooke was trembling. </p>
<p>"Come on Brooke, sit down," she lead Brooke to a seat and placed her in it. Brooke kept staring straight ahead unseeing. Nicole watched her concerned. </p>
<p>"I'm gonna call your parents and Lily's, OK?" she asked Brooke. Brooke nodded but said nothing. Nicole was getting more and more worried, especially after she got back and Brooke hadn't moved. </p>
<p>"Brooke, they'll both be OK," she tried to reassure her friend. Brooke blinked at her. </p>
<p>"I can't lose her, Nic," she whispered. "I'll die without her." Nicole shook her head. </p>
<p>"Don't talk like that. She'll be fine and so will Lily," she sure hoped she sounded more confident than she felt. To tell the truth, she felt the same way as Brooke did. She couldn't envision her life without Lily especially now that she finally had the small Latina's love as well. The thought was nearly unbearable. Last night, everything had been perfect. Nicole wondered how things could go so wrong so fast. </p>
<p>"It's not fair," Brooke said as tears slid down her cheeks unchecked. "I just got her in my life. How can something like this happen?" Nicole sat down next to her and wrapped her arm around Brooke's shoulder.</p>
<p>"I don't know. God, Brooke I wish I did but I don't," she admitted as she too started to cry. Brooke was right, it just wasn't fair. </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Mike and Jane arrived a halfhour later followed by Harrison and Carmen but there was still no news on either girls' condition. Brooke tried to pull herself together some so that her parents and friends didn't suspect anything but Nicole was beginning to fall apart. She was all but climbing the walls in frustration and worry. Brooke shot her a look that plainly told her to stop being so obvious. </p>
<p>"I don't care," Nicole said to Brooke confusing everyone else in the room. Brooke smiled in understanding. </p>
<p>"Where is Lily's family?" Brooke asked. </p>
<p>"Visiting family out of town but on the way," Nicole answered ignoring the surprised looks on everyone's face as to why Nicole Julian would know where Lily's family was. </p>
<p>"Family of Lily Esposito?" a doctor asked. Nicole approached him. </p>
<p>"Is on the way but I came in with her, how is she?"</p>
<p>"We don't give information out to non-family members," he started. Nicole glared at him. </p>
<p>"Cut the crap and tell me how she is or I'll march to her room and find out for myself you overeducated twit!" she snapped. The doctor jumped in surprise and nodded nervously. (Must be an intern) Nic thought dryly.</p>
<p>"Miss Esposito is in stable condition. She suffered a concussion and a deep laceration on her forehead that needed several stitches to close. Her right arm was broken in the crash and several ribs were bruised but thankfully she was wearing her seatbelt and she should be fine with a few rest." </p>
<p>"Thank God," Nicole sighed as she sat down heavily. She was dizzy with relief. </p>
<p>"Do you know anything about a Samantha McPherson?" Jane asked anxiously. The doctor shook his head. </p>
<p>"No, I'm afraid not. Excuse me, I have to get Miss Esposito situated in her room and then you can see her," he said as he left the room. </p>
<p>"Thank God for seatbelts," Carmen remarked. Everyone agreed silently. </p>
<p>"Let's hope Sam is as lucky." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>The waiting was making Brooke nauseous. She and Nic had already been to visit Lily who was semi-conscious, the meds making her fade in and out. She did express concern for Sam but they had no news for her. Brooke was beside herself with worry as she sat in the waiting room. She knew her anxiety level was attracting attention, she was definitely more concerned than a stepsister had any right to be but she didn't care. She would give anything, any amount of money or even her own life to make sure Sam was OK. </p>
<p>"Family of Samantha McPherson?" a doctor stepped into the room. </p>
<p>"Yes?" Jane stood up and faced the doctor. "I'm her mother. How is she?" Brooke sat and waited unable to breathe. </p>
<p>"You're daughter is a very lucky young woman. If she hadn't been wearing her seatbelt she might not have survived," he started. "Samantha suffered a severe concussion as well as several deep cuts that have been sutured. She has some cracked ribs and a broken collarbone from the seatbelt locking. Other than some bruising and some other minor injuries, she should be fine with time and can go home in a few days." </p>
<p>"Oh thank God," Jane sighed echoing Nicole from earlier. Brooke cried with relief. Sam was going to be OK. The doctor smiled. </p>
<p>"You can see her as soon as she's moved to her room," he said as he stood up to leave. </p>
<p>"Thank you, Dr," Jane said. </p>
<p>"My pleasure, I'm just glad this had a happy ending."
</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Nicole sat holding Lily's hand when Lily's mother entered the room at a breakneck pace. She shot Nicole a somewhat dirty look. </p>
<p>"Who are you and what are you doing in my daughter's room?" she asked curtly. </p>
<p>"Mama, this is Nicole and she's my.friend," Lily explained hesitantly. Nicole felt her heart seize a little at Lily's words. She knew Lily wasn't going to sit there and admit to what they were to one another but it still hurt. Lily's mother (Maria) still glared at Nicole. </p>
<p>"I've never met you," Maria said rudely. "Is this accident your fault?" </p>
<p>"Mama!" Lily shifted on the bed a bit to face her mother and gasped at the pain the movement caused. </p>
<p>"Easy, Lily," Nicole soothed, totally ignoring the irate woman in the room. "Don't hurt yourself," she said softly as she brushed some hair out of Lily's face. The simple act of intimacy and familiarity further enraged Maria who turned an alarming shade of red. </p>
<p>"Get away from my daughter," she hissed. Nicole looked at her coldly. </p>
<p>"Your daughter is old enough to choose her own friends, Mrs. Esposito. And she's chosen me so buzz off." Lily snickered slightly at her girlfriend's brassy attitude. If ever there was a fiery match, it was her mother vs. Nicole Julian. </p>
<p>"Don't you speak to me that way, young lady," Maria snapped. Nicole sighed. </p>
<p>"I'm not here to argue with you, I'm here to visit my friend who I care deeply for," Nicole said as Lily smiled at her and then looked at her mother. </p>
<p>"I care for her too, Mama," Lily looked at Nicole for confirmation. Nicole knew what she was asking and nodded with a bright smile on her face. After all, they really had nothing to lose. </p>
<p>"Actually, Mama, there's something I need to tell you. Nicole is more than my friend, she's my girlfriend." </p>
<p>"Excuse me?" Maria said incredulously. Lily swallowed and tried again. </p>
<p>"I'm gay, Mom. I know now probably isn't the best time to tell you seeing as I was almost killed in a car accident but I'm tired of hiding it from you. I could have died and you never would have known the truth. I'm gay and I love Nicole. She's my girlfriend in the romantic dating sense. I'm sorry if that's a problem for you," she explained confidently and unapologetically. </p>
<p>Nicole listened to Lily explain herself to her mother and her heart swelled with love and pride. Lily sounded proud of her and that filled her with a new sense of self worth. She then heard Maria begin a rant in Spanish. While she didn't understand the language, Nicole had no doubt that what the woman was saying would make a sailor blush and judging from the shocked look on Lily's face, she was probably not far off the mark. </p>
<p>"Mama!" Lily hissed. "How dare you?" </p>
<p>"Me? How dare you?" Maria countered. She turned her ire on Nicole. "And you, get out of my sight you pervert!" Nicole unexpectedly burst out laughing. </p>
<p>"Pervert? Man, have you got problems," she laughed. Even Lily looked at her strangely. "I love your daughter, get over it." Maria started ranting in Spanish again and Lily started answering her. Nicole sat and waited for the exchange to end. She caught a few words here and there, but not enough to make out the entire conversation. </p>
<p>"And that's final!" Lily yelled after which she grabbed her pounding head with her good arm and started to cry. Maria stormed out of the room. Nicole moved up onto the bed to hold the crying form. </p>
<p>"OK, what'd I miss?" she asked gently. </p>
<p>"She wanted to know if this was for real or a phase and I told her it was real. That I loved you and I wasn't going to stop because it bothered her. Then she wanted to know if it was your idea or mine and I told her I knew I was gay before you came along. She was not a happy camper." </p>
<p>"That was obvious," Nicole joked. "And that last part?" Lily sighed. </p>
<p>"She wanted me to change my mind or at least get rid of you. She knows you're a Julian and she hates your family. I don't know why, really. And I said I was staying with you despite anything she had to say, I was old enough to make my own decisions and that was final." Nicole leaned her head on Lily's shoulder while being careful not to hurt her. </p>
<p>"I guess you told her," she pointed out. Lily laughed slightly. </p>
<p>"I guess I did. Now I guess we just wait and see what she does next." </p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Harrison and Carmen had gone home earlier and Mike and Jane reluctantly left as well leaving Brooke alone in Sam's hospital room. Sam was still unconscious and Brooke hated sitting there watching her so still. She held Sam's hand and gently stroked the back of it with her thumb while speaking softly. </p>
<p>"Gave me a good scare, Sammy," she said. "I was afraid I was going to lose you. And that scared me. I didn't realize until I saw your car all crumpled there in the road how far I'd fallen. I mean, I knew I loved you, Sam, but until that instant, I didn't know how much. I'm desperately in love with you, I hope you know that." </p>
<p>"I do," came the soft response. Brooke jumped at the sound of Sam's voice. </p>
<p>"Sammy, you're awake," Brooke whispered happily as she leaned over the bed. Sam's eyes slowly opened and focused on Brooke. </p>
<p>"Hi," she said with a weak lopsided grin. Brooke grinned back at her. </p>
<p>"Hey," Brooke answered her. "You scared me." Sam frowned. </p>
<p>"Sorry, didn't mean to. Is Lily OK?" Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, broken arm and a bump on the head. Your car is trashed though." Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"Better it than us," she commented before shutting her eyes and yawning. Brooke pushed Sam's hair out of her face and crawled onto the bed next to her. </p>
<p>"Go back to sleep Sammy, I'll be here when you wake up," she vowed. </p>
<p>"Promise?" Sam asked sleepily. Brooke kissed her temple. </p>
<p>"I promise." </p>
<p>See? I can do a happy ending type thingie too.and I didn't hurt Sam TOO bad...Aeryn </p>
<p>I'll save the REAL Sam abuse for my other two fics that I'm still working on... </p>
