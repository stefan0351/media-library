<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Chapter Fifteen -->

<p>It was nearly two AM and Brooke was beginning to worry. Sam hadn?t come home yet and the snow was coming down at a good pace. The weather report she?d heard called for near blizzard conditions due to a sudden change in fronts and she was scared that Sam would be caught in it and get lost. Everyone, including a sullen Nicole had gone to bed but Brooke couldn?t sleep and knew she wouldn?t until Sam was safely back in the cabin.</p>
<p>&lt;Come on, Sam. This isn?t funny&gt; she thought as she paced by the window with her arms crossed over her chest. She could feel the chill through the plate glass windows as she stared out at the thick snow and shuddered to think about how cold Sam must be out in it.</p>
<p>"Sam still not back?" Lily asked quietly as she came down the stairs. Brooke jumped slightly in surprise and then shook her head.</p>
<p>"I?m getting really worried, Lily," she said her voice full of concern.</p>
<p>"Sam?s a tough girl, I?m sure she?s fine," Lily tried to reassure the fidgety blonde.</p>
<p>"But it?s so cold out there and all she has on is her ski jacket. And it?s snowing so fast. Three inches in the past half-hour. She might be lost and?and?" a few tears slipped down Brooke?s face and Lily enveloped her in a hug.</p>
<p>"Shhh, Brooke, she?ll be fine. Boy, you?re really worried about her aren?t you?" Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah," she sniffled.</p>
<p>"You care about Sam a lot, don?t you?" Lily asked carefully. Brooke eyed her suspiciously. "I overheard the uhm, shouting match from earlier, Brooke. Don?t worry, no one else did."</p>
<p>"Oh God," Brooke sobbed collapsing on the couch. "Lily, what am I going to do? Nicole played us both and now I don?t know what to do."</p>
<p>"Hey, it?s OK. It?ll work out, Brooke. You?ll see. She cares for you too. You?d have to be blind or oblivious?or male not to see it," Lily joked. Brooke stood back up and walked to the window.</p>
<p>"But she?s out there," Brooke said distressed. She ran her hand over the cold glass. "Alone. And it?s so cold." Lily walked up behind her.</p>
<p>"Maybe we should wake the others, grab the lanterns and go look for her? She couldn?t have gotten far," Lily suggested. Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"Get the others," she said firmly. "I?ll call the Ski Patrol on the CB and let them know she?s missing. Then we go looking."</p>
<hr></hr>
<p>Sam walked blindly as the snow started falling faster and faster. She was cursing herself as the cold and wet seeped into her bones and she shook violently.</p>
<p>&lt;Oh, well, you solved a lot, didn't you, Sam? Stormed out as a storm was rolling in. Jesus, and now lost. How pathetic&gt; she sighed. Her breath came out as a frozen cloud and hung in the air in front of her.</p>
<p>&lt;I'll be lucky if someone finds me before the spring thaw&gt;she thought morbidly. She wrapped her arms around her middle and tucked her head down against the wind as she plowed forward the best she could. All she could think about was the warm cabin with the roaring fireplace that she'd foolishly left. And Brooke.</p>
<p>&lt;Shit, she's going to be worried. I'm going to end up ruining her vacation. Damn it&gt; She looked around desperately hoping to see something, anything familiar. But everything was covered in a blanket of white and blended together under the grey sky.</p>
<p>&lt;God, I'm cold&gt; she shivered. She tried to fight the panicked tears that were threatening to spill from her eyes, knowing that they'd only freeze before they got anywhere.</p>
<p>&lt;God, I don't want to die like this&gt; she realized. &lt;But if I don't find shelter soon, I just might&gt;</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry, Brooke," she whispered to the cold night air. She then trudged on.</p>
