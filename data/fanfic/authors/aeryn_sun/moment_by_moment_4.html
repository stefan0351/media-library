<!-- Moment by Moment \ 4. The Battle -->

<p>She's had the same song on repeat on her CD player for the
past hour and a half. It's a good song, `Bother' by Corey Taylor
from the `Spider-Man' soundtrack. But honestly, ninety minutes of it
is enough to drive even a saint to pull out their hair and hit
themselves over the head with a rubber mallet.</p>
<p>Bracing myself for yet another fight, I walk across our
shared bathroom and try her door. To my utter surprise, it's
unlocked. That's odd, given her perpetual hatred of me. She hasn't
let me NEAR her room in ages. She must have recently taken a shower
and forgot to lock it. </p>
<p>I knock, loudly as to be heard over the music, before I open the door.</p>
<p>Sam's a mess and her room reflects that fact. Her posters
are in shreds, some still hanging by little pieces of Scotch tape on
the walls. Her corkboard is a disturbing collage of pictures of
Nicole, all skewered with tacks and covered in red ink. Actually, it
gives me a perverse sense of joy to see her taking her anger out on
the true source of her anguish, however vicariously.</p>
<p>"Go away, bitch," she hisses at me from her desk where she's
drafting what is no doubt yet another scathing letter to Nicole. A
letter that Nicole will photocopy and post throughout the school to
further mock poor Sam. It's sick, really; the way Nicole gets off on
hurting Sam the way she does. </p>
<p>I turn off the CD player and lean against the wall, taking a
relaxed stance rather than my usual `begging for forgiveness for
something I didn't do' posture. I feel like a change is needed.</p>
<p>"I have a name you know," I say calmly. "And oddly enough, it
isn't `bitch'." She snorts at me.</p>
<p>"Yeah, well mine's not `dyke', `carpet-muncher', `cunt', `whore', `lesbo', `muff-diver', or `pussy-licker'
either. But no one seems to remember that," she points out
bitterly. And that's just a small sample of the names that have been
flying at her these past few weeks.</p>
<p>It's a strange duality. While she was dating Nicole, no one
cared what her sexuality was. Sure there was a small bit of `Oh my
God, did you hear?' that went around the school but it was considered
Sam and Nicole's business. Besides, this is California and if you
can honestly say you don't know at least one gay person, you
obviously JUST got here.</p>
<p>But now that Nicole's true motivation has been revealed and
she's done her spin control for herself and against Sam and I,
suddenly, Sam (and somewhat by extension me) is the absolute bane of
the existence of Kennedy High. Hell, I think April Tuna and Emory
Dick are more popular than Sam is right now. And that frightens me.</p>
<p>(The fact that I just used `April Tuna', `Emory Dick',
and `popular' in a positive sense, alarms me as well)</p>
<p>Then again, it occurs to me just now that this double
standard that works against Sam and I is probably the same double
standard that lets the guys check out each other's packages in the
locker room after football games and like, that's OK, because, guys
DO that.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>It's still unfair.</p>
<p>"Sam," I start patiently. "We really need to talk." Her
glare, somehow, gets impossibly hotter.</p>
<p>"What do you and I possibly have to talk about?" she sneers.
Her tone of voice is not unlike nails on a chalkboard to my ears and
makes me cringe. Sam's voice is usually so sweet and low. This one
just sucks.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know?how about how you helped Nicole use me?" she
suggests. Before I can interrupt to differ, she keeps going.</p>
<p>"You do realize, Brooke," she emphasizes my name in such a
way that I like the sound of `bitch' better. "That what she did to me
was one step away from rape?" God, just the sound of that word makes
me want to revisit the bacon and eggs I had for breakfast earlier.
Because I know in my heart that she's right.</p>
<p>"Sam, I don't know how to make you believe that I had nothing
to do with what Nicole did. I was just as shocked as you?" I try to
explain. She stands up to face me, anger pouring off her in almost
tangible waves.</p>
<p>"Why? Why were you shocked? Because she went behind your
back and beat you to it? She got to deflower me when that's what YOU
wanted? Damn, you're just making your way through our entire class,
aren't you? First Josh, then Harrison, then you aimed for me?"</p>
<p>"It's not like that," I say, hearing my voice raise a little
because she's hurting my feelings. She arches an eyebrow, looking
pleased with herself at hitting a nerve. She's hurting so badly that
she just wants to make everyone around her suffer as greatly. I
can't fault her for it.</p>
<p>"No? Come on, Brookie, I've heard the stories Nicole's
spreading around school. That trip to Tahiti with Nicole last
summer? That girl, what was her name??" She's baiting me and damn me
I'm going to go for it.</p>
<p>"Inola," I supply, barely above a whisper. Sam nods, a
crooked smile marring her features.</p>
<p>"Inola. According to what I've heard, you had quite a time
with Inola," she smirks devilishly but it lacks her usual spirit.
It's cold and mean and turns my stomach. I nod because it's the
truth. Why lie to her now?</p>
<p>"Fheh," she snorts again. A very unladylike trait, I must
say but, I'm losing focus.</p>
<p>"So, what do you want, Brooke? You want a shot at me?" Her
words shock me back to fine clarity and I watch as she spreads her
arms open wide and flops down on the bed on her back. "Well, here you
go. I won't even make you fight as hard as Nicole had to for so
long. You want a `fun fuck'? Go ahead, just let me know when you're
done so I can finish my homework."</p>
<p>I'm at once shocked by her words and yet glad she's at least
talking to me, however ludicrous her dialogue may be.</p>
<p>"You're not ready to understand yet," I realize sadly. She
sighs heavily from the bed.</p>
<p>"Yeah, whatever," she scoffs. </p>
<p>Suddenly feeling brazen, I stalk to the bed and lean over her
body, pinning her down for a second. I don't know what's possessing
me to act like this and it may end up getting me into even more
trouble in the long run but screw it, what have I got left to lose?</p>
<p>My pride? Heh, that's long gone.</p>
<p>I kiss her, long and hard, hoping to convey my own hurt along
with my apology and sympathy and yes, love with it. She panics at
first, and fights against me, small frightened mewing sounds coming
from the back of her throat. I feel my tears coursing down my face
as I wonder exactly how far Nicole had to push to get what she
wanted. But then I feel her relax somewhat and it gives me hope.</p>
<p>We're both breathless when I pull away.</p>
<p>"Listen to me, Sam," I say, my voice steady and calm. Much
calmer than I feel right now. She nods at me as she stares into my
eyes. She still looks slightly frightened but there's a spark of
curiosity in those brown eyes that she can't hide.</p>
<p>"I would never, EVER hurt you the way Nicole has hurt you," I
say evenly. "I had no idea she was going to do such a horrible, mean
and heartless thing. If I did know, I would have done ANYTHING to
stop her. I swear that to you."</p>
<p>"If it had been me you slept with, lost your virginity to,
there would be no doubting how I truly felt for you. The love I feel
would have been evident and you would not regret a second of it. You
would NOT equate the experience to rape. And I would not have turned
on you the next morning. If I EVER have the privilege of making love
to you, it wouldn't be a `fun fuck'. It'd be love, Sammy. And I'd
want it to last forever. Do you understand me?"</p>
<p>She nods again and I release her, standing up to leave her
room. I leave her sitting stupefied on her bed. But I can't resist
one last parting shot.</p>
<p>"Think about that when you remember who broke Nicole's nose
after you ran away that day. Remember who it was that cracked one of
the girl's ribs and now goes to therapy for anger management. THEN
decide who the guilty parties are."</p>
<p>I barely get to my own room before my legs give out and my
heart hammers so hard I'm afraid of a heart attack at 17.</p>
<p>Did I really just do all that?</p>
<p>I basically just admitted to Sam that I love her. Oh God.</p>
<p>God, I hope I haven't made things worse.</p>
<p>Exhaustion claims me in seconds to a fitful slumber.</p>
