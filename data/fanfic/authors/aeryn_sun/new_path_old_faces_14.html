<!-- New Path, Old Faces \ Round Two -->

<p>Two weeks passed since graduation and Sam was currently in
downtown San Francisco on the request of Kelly Foster. She really didn't want to
be there and furthermore hated the fact that she hadn't told Brooke where she
was going. Brooke thought she was on a short trip somewhere else and Sam hated
herself for her dishonesty but knew that telling Brooke where she was going and
why would only upset her. So she parked her car and got out, heading into
Kelly's gallery where she wasn't surprised to see Kelly waiting for her.
</p>
<p>"Sam," Kelly greeted her curtly. </p>
<p>"Kelly," Sam said in the same tone. "Why did you want me to
come all the way out here? Couldn't you have talked to me on the phone?"
</p>
<p>"I want to talk to you about Brooke and this thing the two of
you have going without you hanging up the phone," Kelly explained. </p>
<p>"It's not a `thing', it's love," Sam sighed. </p>
<p>"I'm sure you think it is, Sam, but it's not." </p>
<p>"Why? Because you say it isn't? You know, Brooke and I have
been through this all ready, numerous times. If you called me all this way to
tell me Brooke isn't gay and to knock this whole thing off, I'll sock you in the
jaw," Sam warned. </p>
<p>"Don't talk to me like that, young lady," Kelly snapped back. </p>
<p>"Oh, you people," Sam muttered remembering Mike saying the
same thing. "You'd think living in San Francisco would have made you more open
minded." </p>
<p>"What people do behind closed doors is none of my business but
we're talking about my daughter. You've corrupted her," Kelly growled. Sam threw
her hands in the air. </p>
<p>"Why am I always the bad guy?" she lamented. "Look, I did
nothing, I repeat, N-O-T-H-I-N-G to Brooke. I was just as surprised as everyone
else that she felt the same for me as I did for her. I didn't corrupt her,
convert her, spike her vitamins, perform any bad mojo, or love spells. So just
accept it or get out of both our lives. At any rate, you should really see
someone about your homophobia." Kelly reached out and slapped Sam hard across
the face. </p>
<p>"You've got one hell of a mouth on you," Kelly snarled. Sam
glared at her. (Aw Hell, might as well make her REALLY mad) Sam thought to
herself. </p>
<p>"So your daughter tells me," Sam taunted further angering
Kelly. </p>
<p>"That's disgusting," Kelly spat. Sam laughed bitterly.
</p>
<p>"Oh, learn to take a joke," Sam told her. "I love your
daughter, she loves me. God, I'm thinking about getting `I love Brooke' tattooed
on my forehead just to save myself time." </p>
<p>"She isn't gay," Kelly protested. </p>
<p>"She is too," Sam argued back. "I am not going to stand here
and argue this with you until we're both blue in the face. I know the truth and
I think you do too, you just won't admit it." </p>
<p>"This will destroy her life." </p>
<p>"Like you have?" Sam yelled. Kelly stared at her. </p>
<p>"What do you mean by that?" she asked. </p>
<p>"Do you have any idea what your snide little comments to her
as a child about her weight and then your abandoning her did to Brooke's
psyche?" </p>
<p>"I don't know what you're talking about," Kelly said
defensively. Sam reached into her pocket and slammed a packet of laxatives down
on the desk in front of them. </p>
<p>"This, this is what you've done to her. She suffers from an
eating disorder. She doesn't know that I know but ever since your last visit
she's reverted. She is the most beautiful person, inside and out that I have
ever known and you make her feel ugly, worthless, unwanted, and unloved despite
all the people in her life who tell her otherwise. You scarred her, emotionally
and mentally and it's something she's going to have to fight for the rest of her
life. And I'll always be there for her. Can't say the same for you though, can
I?" Kelly was silent. </p>
<p>"Yeah, didn't think so. You wounded her for life the day you
walked out on her for your own selfish reasons. I can't say that it wasn't the
best thing for her because honestly I think she's better off without you." </p>
<p>"How dare you blame me for that!" Kelly yelled. </p>
<p>"It's your fault!" Sam yelled back. "Even Brooke admits that's
where it started. God, take responsibilty for once in your life." </p>
<p>"You have no idea who I am or why I did the things I did,"
Kelly defended herself. </p>
<p>"You're right, I don't but you don't know Brooke either so
don't stand there and tell me what she can and can not be. But you see, the
eating disorder thing is something she can work on, change and fight. Being gay
isn't. No amount of you protesting or yelling or denying it will change that." </p>
<p>"She's my baby girl," Kelly whispered. </p>
<p>"And she still is. Being gay didn't change that. Either accept
her or leave her alone but please stop hurting her. At any rate, I'm through
here and I'm leaving now, so have a nice life." Sam headed for the door while
Kelly sat shaking her head. </p>
<p>"Sam?" Kelly called after her just as Sam reached the door. </p>
<p>"What?" Sam asked suspiciously. </p>
<p>"I don't?I can't?take care of her, please," she asked. Sam
nodded. </p>
<p>"Always." </p>

<p>"Princess, we need to talk," Sam said as she walked into
Brooke's room. Brooke looked up from her bed where she sat reading. Sam thought
she looked tired but she knew why. </p>
<p>"Sure, Sammy, what's up?" Sam thought about telling her about
her visit with Kelly but decided there was a more important matter at hand. She
tossed the laxative package onto the bed at Brooke's side with a sad expression
on her face. </p>
<p>"Did you think I wouldn't notice?" she asked quietly as Brooke
hung her head and started to cry. Sam sat down on the bed and tried to pull
Brooke to her but Brooke pushed her away. </p>
<p>"Leave me alone," Brooke protested. Sam sighed and tried
again, this time succeeding in wrapping her arms around Brooke's thin frame. </p>
<p>"Never, Princess," she whispered. "Come on, what's causing
this? I want to help. Was it your mother?" Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"Some, I guess. She called me horsey," she told Sam. Sam
sighed again. </p>
<p>"I should have socked her in the jaw," she said more to
herself than Brooke. "Brooke, you are not horsey. What have I told you about
your weight?" she asked as she stroked Brooke's blonde hair away from the other
girls' hazel eyes. </p>
<p>"Even if?" Brooke asked. Sam smiled. </p>
<p>"You're right, you're not by any means fat and even if you
were I would still love you," Sam said patiently. "I didn't fall in love with
the numbers on some scale, I fell in love with you." </p>
<p>"I'm out of control again, Sammy," Brooke complained.
</p>
<p>"No you're not, love. You just feel that way because Kelly
reacted so badly. You know, it warps the mind how two totally wiggy people like
Mike and Kelly could have such a wonderful and loving daughter like you. Anyway,
you're not out of control unless you let yourself be." </p>
<p>"But my Mom hates me," Brooke weeped. Sam sent majorly bad
vibes back in Kelly's direction. </p>
<p>"She doesn't hate you, she's just having trouble dealing with
this new part of you, love. Give her time and she'll come around, just like Mike
did. And if she doesn't, is it really that great a loss? All she does is hurt
you." </p>
<p>"She's my MOM," Brooke protested. </p>
<p>"I know Princess. But this," she held up the package, "is
going to stop. Or this time I will take you back to the Clinic," she finished
gently but firmly. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"Will you help me Sammy? I don't want to be sick," Brooke
leaned into Sam. </p>
<p>"I'll always be here for you, love. You needn't even ask." </p>
<p>"Thank you, Sammy," she relaxed into Sam's arms and sat in
silence for so long that Sam thought she'd fallen asleep. </p>
<p>"Well, since you know my secret, I might as well tell you that
I know yours. I know you went to see Kelly," Brooke said quietly later,
startling Sam who'd fallen into a light sleep. </p>
<p>"Uh?" Sam didn't know what to say. </p>
<p>"I'm not mad, Sam," Brooke reassured her. "What'd she have to
say?" </p>
<p>"Nothing much, just that you weren't gay and that I corrupted
you," Sam told her. Brooke sighed. </p>
<p>"I'm sorry." </p>
<p>"What for?" </p>
<p>"You always end up with the short end of the stick, Sam, while
I end up looking innocent when we're in this together. I really wish people
would see that," Brooke explained. </p>
<p>"So do I but it isn't your fault. Don't let it bother you, I
handled her," Sam hugged her. </p>
<p>"Still, it couldn't have been pleasant." </p>
<p>"No," Sam said honestly. "But it's over. Now we'll work on
getting you better, love. One day at a time, together." Brooke smiled.
</p>
<p>"Together, Sammy. I like the sound of that." </p>
