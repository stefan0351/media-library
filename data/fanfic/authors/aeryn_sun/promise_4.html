<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Chapter Three -->

<p>Brooke wiped at her eyes and started to reapply her makeup in the mirror of the Novak. She had tried not to let the little exchange she witnessed between Sam and Nicole bother her, but she couldn't help regretting the fact that it wasn't her standing there being so openly intimate with Sam. She resented Nicole for what she'd taken from her, in Brooke's opinion. And she was highly jealous as well.</p>
<p>&lt;Woulda, coulda, shoulda&gt; she mourned silently. &lt;Damn Nicole. If I hadn't been so nervous, so scared of Sam not returning my feelings I would have had a shot. Come to find out, Sam probably would have gone along with me for 'fun' sake, like she is with Nicole. Damn damn damn&gt;</p>
<p>The tears started fresh just as the door opened and the object of Brooke's silent affection walked in. Sam stopped and observed the upset cheerleader for a few seconds before speaking.</p>
<p>"Brooke, are you OK?" she asked quietly. Brooke stared at her in the mirror, the concerned look on Sam's face making her pain even sharper.</p>
<p>"'M fine, Sam," she managed to mutter. Sam walked closer shaking her head.</p>
<p>"I don't believe you. Something is really bothering you and I wish you'd talk to me. But all we do lately is argue and I hate it, Brooke. I HATE fighting with you," Sam confessed as she gathered the stiff blonde into a hug from behind.</p>
<p>"I hate it too, Sammy," Brooke whispered relaxing slightly. Sam rested her head on Brooke's shoulder and they stared at each other in the mirror. Brooke was again distracted by Sam's natural beauty, a habit that happened to her a lot. </p>
<p>"Talk to me, Brooke," Sam pleaded still keeping eye contact. "Let me try and help, please?" Brooke closed her eyes as a few more tears slid down her face, breaking the intense level of eye contact they had.</p>
<p>"Oh, Sam, you can't help. It's beyond both of us," Brooke explained as she turned around in Sam's arms and rested her forehead against Sam's shoulder. Sam felt so warm and comfortable to her, she didn't want to leave the embrace. Sam stroked Brooke's back in comforting circles.</p>
<p>"I don't like the sound of that," Sam said softly. "Come on, what's so bad that the two of us can't figure it out?"</p>
<p>&lt;I desperately love you, Sam. That's what&gt; Brooke thought remorsefully. &lt;But you're dating my former best friend and seem happy. I don't want to pull you in two directions just because I'm jealous and selfish&gt;</p>
<p>"Nothing Sam, I'll be fine," she said out loud a bit stronger. "PMS, I guess." Sam arched an eyebrow at her.</p>
<p>"I still don't believe you but I'm not going to force you to talk to me if you don't want to," she said. Brooke could hear the undercurrent of hurt in Sam's voice and it hit her like a physical blow. She would never want to hurt Sam and yet she just did.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Sam, I just..." she looked up into those rich brown eyes and debated whether or not to tell Sam how she felt. Maybe if she confessed the truth, things would work out in a positive way.</p>
<p>"You ?just what?, Brooke?" Sam asked patiently.</p>
<p>"I..."</p>
<p>"And what do we have here?" Nicole asked from the doorway. Her hands were on her hips and she had a decidedly unpleased look on her face. Brooke jumped and tried to move away from Sam but Sam's arms were locked around her waist. She was afraid that she was going to get Sam into trouble with Nicole for the embrace. Sam tilted her head and looked at her girlfriend.</p>
<p>"Brooke's upset. I'm trying to find out why," she responded simply. Obviously, Sam saw nothing wrong with what was going on.</p>
<p>"You two look awful cozy," Nicole sneered. Sam shrugged.</p>
<p>"She's my best friend and step sister, Nicole. You know we're close. Get a grip and drop the jealous act, will you?" Sam's words warmed Brooke's insides to an extent. She liked the thought of being Sam's best friend even if it was the best she could get for now. It would have to do. She watched curiously as Nicole's face flushed red.</p>
<p>"I'm not jealous. I think I have a right to be suspicious of the closeness between you," Nicole snapped. Sam laughed, sending the low rumble through Brooke's body.</p>
<p>"Please, Nic. We both know Brooke doesn't think of me that way," she scoffed. Brooke swallowed the sob that almost escaped her at the words and as Sam disengaged her grip on her waist.</p>
<p>&lt;Oh Sammy, if only you knew&gt; Brooke sighed to herself.</p>
<p>&lt;Yeah Sam, right, if only you knew&gt; Nicole seethed silently.</p>
<p>A silent but intense staring contest erupted between the two blondes as they regarded each other across the bathroom. Sam was mostly oblivious to it as she tried to calm Nicole down.</p>
<p>"Anyway, I mean really, Nic, a rendezvous in the Novak? How...cliched," she snickered. Nicole and Brooke said nothing, just glared at one another, neither willing to back down first. And entire conversation took place within their glances.</p>
<p>Narrowed hazel eyes and a clenched jaw &lt;I hate you for what you've done&gt; </p>
<p>An arched eyebrow and a smirk &lt;Like I care, Queenie? She's mine now and all because you didn't act when you had the chance. I win&gt;</p>
<p>A scowl and a huff of air through the nose &lt;You haven't won yet. I'll fix you, bitch&gt;</p>
<p>A wider smirk &lt;Come and get me. I'd like to see you try&gt;</p>
<p>"Ah, guys? Hello, Earth to the blonde brigade," Sam called to Brooke and Nicole. They both settled their gazes on her. "OK, hi, remember me? We're going to be late for class so if you two are done with the contest to be Alpha Female, can we go?" </p>
<p>"Of course, Sam," Nicole said, slipping her arm around Sam's waist possessively. Brooke nearly growled at the sight as Nicole smiled sweetly at her just to rub it in.</p>
<p>"See you in class, Sam," Brooke ground out through her teeth, not willing to let Nicole beat her down, especially in front of Sam. "And I'll see you at practice, Nicole," her voice dripped with scorn and distaste but Nicole ignored it.</p>
<p>"Later B."</p>
