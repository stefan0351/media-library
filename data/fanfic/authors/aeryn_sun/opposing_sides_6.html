<!-- Opposing Sides \ Chapter 6 -->

<p>Sam sighed and toweled off her hair. She felt like a snowball rolling down a hill, gathering speed and heading for a large brick wall. And she shuddered to think what was going to happen when she hit that wall. (Mom knows I'm gay. Guess there's no more hiding. But what do I do now? I can't just come right out and tell Brooke how I feel, despite Mom's advice. God, Brooke'd be horrified by that. She'd hate me and then go running to Nicole and Mary Cherry that I'm gay and my life at Kennedy will be over) </p>
<p>Still thinking, she was finished getting dressed and brushing her hair when Brooke knocked on the door and walked in. Sam fixed a glare on her despite the fact that she wasn't even mad at Brooke. She just felt the need to keep up the appearance of anger or she was afraid she'd grab ahold of Brooke and never let go. </p>
<p>"What do you want?" she snarled. Brooke looked wounded and sighed. </p>
<p>"To talk, to apologized for my insensitve words the other morning," Brooke explained. </p>
<p>"Well, you apologized. Feel better? You can leave now," Sam instructed angrily. Angry she was familiar with, comfortable with. It was the deeper stuff that scared her. Brooke shook her head but made no attempt to leave. </p>
<p>"Sam, we need to talk." </p>
<p>"What's there to talk about, Brooke? How I'm an unemotional ass? Thanks we all ready had that conversation," Sam said sarcastically. </p>
<p>"I shouldn't have said those things, Sammy. You do have feelings and I know it. It's just what you said hit me close to home and I struck back where I knew it would hurt and that was wrong of me," Brooke said patiently. Sam frowned at her for a minute. </p>
<p>"OK, apology accepted. I'm sorry too. We square?" she asked sincerely. Brooke breathed a silent sigh of relief that Sam seemed to let her anger go. (Now for the hard part) she thought. </p>
<p>"We're good. There is something else I wanted to talk to you about lately though," Brooke said as she stepped closer to Sam. She could feel her heart hammering in her chest. Sam looked slightly frightened at Brooke's advance and skittered back a few steps, surprising Brooke and almost making her laugh. It gave her some of the evidence she needed about who Sam had feelings for. </p>
<p>(Oh, please be me) Brooke prayed. If it wasn't, she was about to make a big mistake. </p>
<p>"What's that?" Sam asked, referring to what Brooke wanted to talk about and coughing after she asked to try and get her voice back down to its normal octave. Brooke smiled. </p>
<p>"I have this problem, Sam and I need someone to talk to," she started. </p>
<p>"And you're choosing me? That is bad," Sam joked nervously. </p>
<p>"Ha ha. Anyway, I've fallen for someone, Sam. Completely. I'm talking so badly that I can't think about anyone else. I dream about them day and night. My heart pounds in my chest just thinking about being near them and I get an adrenaline rush," Brooke explained. </p>
<p>"Sounds like you've got it bad," Sam said quietly as her heart shattered into a million pieces. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"I do, Sammy. So bad," she agreed. </p>
<p>"So what's the problem?" Sam asked, all ready vowing that whoever they are they'd better treat Brooke right or she'll kill them. </p>
<p>"This person is a friend and I don't want to lose them as such. Their friendship means that much to me." </p>
<p>Sam groaned internally. (Probably Harrison) she sighed. </p>
<p>"If they're that good a friend, Brooke, than they'll understand even if they don't reciprocate." Brooke let out a heavy sigh. </p>
<p>"There's more to it than just that, Sam," she said. Sam looked at her. </p>
<p>"OK, what else is there?" </p>
<p>"The person that I'm hopelessly in love with, and I know that it's love, is a girl," Brooke whispered. Sam almost crashed to the floor she became so dizzy. As it was she need to grab the edge of her desk for support. She was silent for several minutes. </p>
<p>"You're gay?" she finally whispered to Brooke. Brooke nodded. "Well, when did THAT happen?" Brooke couldn't help laughing. </p>
<p>"Let's face it, Sam, my relationships with men have always been somewhat lacking," she pointed out. "I dated guys because it's what was expected of me and no girl came along that really tickled my fancy, until her." </p>
<p>"Oh," was all Sam could manage past the lump in her throat. She was positive that Brooke was talking about Nicole and it destroyed her. She just wanted to leave the room and get as far from Brooke as she could before the tears started. </p>
<p>"Well, I'm sure she'll be really happy Brooke. Good for you," she said as her voice caught. Brooke took another step closer. </p>
<p>"I hope she is," she took a deep breath and decided to just take the risk. "Are you Sam?" she asked in a whisper. Sam blinked in confusion. </p>
<p>"I'm happy that you're comfortable with yourself," Sam answered, misunderstanding the question. Brooke sighed in frustration. </p>
<p>"That's not what I meant, Sammy. The girl I was talking about, the one who I can't stop thinking about because I love so much, is you," she confessed. Sam's eyes grew so wide they engulfed her face and she paled. </p>
<p>"Wh?what?" she gasped. Brooke reached out and cupped Sam's face in her hand. Sam didn't move, she was frozen in place by shock. </p>
<p>"I'm in love with you, Sam," Brooke said again as she brought their faces together for a passionate kiss. She felt and heard Sam whimper but the brunette didn't pull away. Their bodies started to instinctively move closer together until Sam pulled away suddenly. She stared at Brooke with a look of mixed fear and surprise. </p>
<p>"Sam?" Brooke panted as Sam backed away. Sam started shaking her head and kept backing away. </p>
<p>"N?n?no," Sam stuttered, backing away so quickly she tripped on a chair and fell over. "Stay away from me." She got back to her feet and lunged for the door before darting out it. She went down over the stairs and out the front door without another word. </p>
<p>"SAM!" Brooke called worriedly. She hadn't been expecting that reaction from Sam at all. As she watched Sam run out the door she ran a hand through her hair in disgust with herself. </p>
<p>"Oh, crap." </p>
