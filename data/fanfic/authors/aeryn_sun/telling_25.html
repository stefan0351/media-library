<!-- Telling Series \ Section 7: Dad - You Can Sleep While I Drive -->

<p>Brooke emerged from the shower feeling refreshed and alive again for the
first time in three weeks. She found that Sam had finished packing as was
sitting patiently in the bed with a distant look on her face. She walked over
and ran her hands through Sam's shorter locks. </p>
<p>"Why'd you cut it, Sammy?" Sam purred at the scalp massage. </p>
<p>"For a change, I guess. It's only three inches and it'll grow back. You know,
new scenery, new look. Don't worry, I hate it too." Brooke smiled wryly. </p>
<p>"I don't hate it, I think it makes you look elfish," Sam arched an eyebrow.
"As much as I love your hair long, I like it this way too." Sam smiled back and
her eyes finally focused in the present. Brooke wondered where her mind had
actually been. </p>
<p>"Ready to go, Brooke?" Brooke nodded </p>
<p>"As long as you've packed my stuff. Where we headed?" Sam shook her head. </p>
<p>"Uh-uh, it's a surprise. You'll find out when we get there, trust me," Brooke
leaned in and kissed her. </p>
<p>"Always," she promised. </p>

<p>Brooke fell asleep not long after they left the Palace and Sam was glad. She
wasn't really up to conversation, or more accurately explainations. The past
three weeks without Brooke had without a doubt been the worst of her young life.
She'd made a horrible mistake in leaving, she knew that now. She needed no other
proof than to look at the frail form curled up into a small ball in the
passenger seat next to her. She's just been so sure that it was the right thing
to do and now the guilt and doubt were gnawing at her like insistant persistant
hunger pains. (Cute analogy, Sam. You are just SO damn witty. I hate myself) She
sighed and turned the radio on low for company and to try and drown out her own
thoughts. </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">(Under a blackened sky <br>
Far beyond the glaring streetlights <br>
Sleeping on empty dreams <br>
The vultures lie in wait </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">You lay down beside me then <br>
You were with me every waking hour <br>
So close I could feel your breath </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">When all we wanted was the dream <br>
To have and to hold that precious little thing <br>
Like every generation yields <br>
A newborn hope unjaded by their years </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Pressed up against the glass <br>
Found myself wanting sympathy <br>
But to be consumed again <br>
Oh I know would be the death of me </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">And there is a love that's inherently given <br>
The kind of blindness often to appease <br>
In the light of forbidden joy <br>
Oh I know I won't receive it </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">When all we wanted was the dream <br>
To have and to hold that precious little thing <br>
Like every generation yields <br>
A newborn hope unjaded by their years </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">You know if I leave you now <br>
It doesn't mean that I love you any less <br>
It's just the state that I'm in <br>
I can't be good to anyone else like this </font> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">When all we wanted was the dream <br>
To have and to hold that precious little thing <br>
Like every generation yields <br>
A newborn hope unjaded by their years) </font> </p>
<p>The words somehow struck Sam as appropriate in some ironic and sardonic sort
of way. That was her and Brooke, trying to avoid the vultures and yet trying to
hold on to the precious thing that they had, their dream of themselves. And yet
it was taken away by Mike and then she had left Brooke. It just seemed to her
that she was doing more harm than good being home. (How did Brooke interpret my
leaving? Did she feel abandoned? Unloved? That was never my intention. Why can't
I ever seem to do anything right? I seem to destroy everything I touch. Reverse
Midas touch, everything I come into contact with turns to dust) </p>
<p>"Sam?" Brooke's groggy voice filtered over to her, breaking her from her
thoughts. Sam glanced over as Brooke unfolded herself and stretched as much as
she could in the cramped seat. </p>
<p>"Did I wake you with the radio, love?" Sam whispered. Brooke shook her head.
</p>
<p>"No. I didn't mean to fall asleep on you," Brooke yawned. Sam smiled and
shrugged. </p>
<p>"Sometimes sleep is best," she said plainly as she watched for her exit.
Brooke watched her closely in confusion. She wasn't sure but it seemed to her
that Sam was shutting her out. Sam saw her staring and frowned. "What?" </p>
<p>"What's wrong?" Brooke asked seriously and to the point. Sam's frown
deepened. </p>
<p>"Nothing's wrong, Brooke. I'm concentrating on driving," Sam responded a
little shortly. Brooke wasn't buying that but decided not to push it any further
right now. There'd be plenty of time for talking when they got to whereever it
was they were going. Speaking of which. </p>
<p>"So, do I get any hints on where we're going?" Brooke asked lightly. Sam
seemed to relax at the change of subject and smiled a bit. </p>
<p>"Nope. But I will tell you that it's exactly what we need to heal. Both of
us," she said firmly and confidently. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"All right, I believe you. How was San Francisco?" Brooke asked as she came
fully awake. Sam sighed. This is what she was hoping to avoid. She really wasn't
in a talkative mood but knew she had to say something or Brooke would know she
had something on her mind. </p>
<p>"It was OK," she answered with a shrug. "It sucked because you weren't with
me though," she stated honestly. And it had. All the cool things she had seen or
the places she'd been to didn't mean a thing because the blonde who had her
heart wasn't there to share it with her. </p>
<p>"I missed you," Brooke repeated her earlier sentiment. Sam nodded. </p>
<p>"Ditto, Brooke." </p>
<p>"Dad's gonna flip when he finds me gone," Brooke reminded her with a devilish
grin. Sam echoed the grin. </p>
<p>"Yup," she agreed. She hated the idea of leaving her mother to deal with that
particular mess but they both agreed that this was their only option for helping
Brooke. And whatever it took, Sam was willing to do. </p>
