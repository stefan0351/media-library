<chapter title="Prologue">
<p>Brooke was livid. She was beyond livid. She was close to being in a murderous rage. She didn't know what to do with herself or what to do about how she felt. All she did know was that there was one person who she wanted to wrap her hands around the throat of and squeeze. She wanted to make her hurt as bad as she was hurting right now. And if Brooke had her way, she was going to find a way to make Nicole Julian suffer.</p>
<p>It had started about two months ago. To the shock of everyone, Sam had quietly announced at a family dinner that she was gay. No dramatics, no fanfare or build up, just a quiet admission of who she was. She wasn't looking for permission or anything; she was just being honest. And Brooke was blown away by the strength it must have taken for Sam to do such a thing. Jane admitted that she had her suspicions for a while and while she was still stunned, she was going to be OK with it. Mike was shocked and surprised, which wasn't surprising to Brooke. Her father was so oblivious sometimes that she swore he wouldn't know the sky was blue unless you informed him. And Brooke, well, she was elated.</p>
<p>For quite a while, Brooke was aware that her feelings for Sam were less than friendly or sisterly. They bordered on the downright impure. She was captivated by everything that was Sam. From the other girl's hair to her eyes, lips and scent, she wanted Sam in everyway. Brooke knew she was bisexual if not gay herself but had never been brave enough to tell anyone. Anyone but her best friend Nicole, that is.</p>
<p>She had haltingly confessed her feelings for Sam to Nicole a while before Sam came out after Nic caught her ogling the brunette in gym class. Nicole had confronted her about the 'fuck me please' looks she was shooting Sam and Brooke crumbled. She told Nic about how she felt for Sam. How the journalist's mere presence turned her knees to jelly, her stomach flip-flopped and her heart raced. She told of the detailed and vivid dreams where she made love to Sam repeatedly, trusting her best friend not to betray her with the information. And while Nicole never told another soul, Brooke knew that she should have expected Nicole to use the information against her eventually.</p>
<p>After Sam came out to the family, she also told her friends. She had no intention of hiding herself. It spread through the school like wildfire but Sam paid no attention to the whispers and slurs. She was who she was and the Hell with what anyone thought. Again Brooke was in awe of the girl and her inner strength. She stood by Sam's side through it, knowingly jeopardizing her 'popular' label but not caring. Sam was more important to her. And eventually, probably because the queen of the school was standing beside her supporting her, the rumors and harassment died down. Brooke was hoping that eventually she'd work up the nerve to tell Sam how she felt. She was almost there too. Sam was really appreciative of her support and they'd grown closer because of it. But just as Brooke started to work up the nerve, Nicole got in her way.</p>
<hr/>
<p>"Oh mah Gawd, Brookie, did ya hear th' latest?" Mary Cherry asked at lunch two weeks earlier. Brooke sighed into her salad and braced herself for another onslaught of the Southerner's personal brand of 'Not Necessarily the News'.</p>
<p>"No, Mary Cherry, I haven't. What's up?" she asked boredly while scanning the lunchroom for Sam. She had hardly seen her all day and was missing her.</p>
<p>"Seems ouah very own Miz Julian has switched to the Sapphic side!" Mary Cherry exclaimed barely in control of her facilities. Brooke's head snapped around so fast Mary Cherry could have sworn she heard it pop.</p>
<p>"WHAT?" Brooke nearly screamed. She had a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach. She just KNEW where this was going and it was making her sick. Mary Cherry nodded.</p>
<p>"Uh-huh. Seems Nic's bin holdin' out on us. She's a muffdiver," Mary Cherry said conspirally. </p>
<p>"Speak English please. Where did you hear this?" Brooke demanded to know. Mary Cherry beamed. She loved being the center of attention and having all the information to hold over other people. She felt SO important.</p>
<p>"Straight from th' horse's mouth, if y'all will pardon th' pun," she responded. "Nic tol' me las' night tha' she's got herself a giiiiiiiiirlfrieand."</p>
<p>"Oh Jesus," Brooke mumbled. She turned back to Mary Cherry. "Who?"</p>
<p>"That's th' serprizin' part! Wuld ya bulieve Spammy McFearsome?" Brooke stood up and ran to the bathroom, unable to stand hearing the news.</p>
<p>"Ah know! Disgustin', ain't it?" Mary Cherry called after her.</p>
<hr/>
<p>From that point on Brooke anger and hurt continued to grow. When she confronted Nic about it, Nicole simply told her that she was taking advantage of the opportunity put before her. Sam was a hottie and she'd have to be a fool to pass that up. Brooke had waited too long to act, that wasn't her fault. She told Brooke that maybe if the taller blonde had a backbone and had gone after what she wanted, she'd know what a great kisser Sam was instead of Nicole. And Nicole gloated that she couldn't wait to feel Sam's passion in between the sheets. Brooke hauled off and slapped her for that comment and Nicole had only smiled at her. It was then that Brooke realized Nicole's true motivation. She was going to use Brooke's feelings for Sam to destroy her, possibly destroy Brooke and Sam both. But Brooke wasn't going to let that happen. And thus the war inside the popular clique began.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter One">
<p>"Will you calm down, Brooke? God, who are you suddenly? My mother?" Sam snapped as Brooke stood in her bedroom door with her hands on her hips staring angrily at her.</p>
<p>"No, Sam, I'm not but you can't go out with Nicole," she responded in a firm tone. Sam laughed sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Says who? You? What's the matter, Brooke? Jealous?" Sam tossed out while rechecking her hair. Brooke jumped at the comment and then realized that Sam meant jealous that she was going out with Nicole and not the other way around.</p>
<p>"No, I'm not. But you dating Nic is like...I don't know. It goes against the natural order of the universe or something," Brooke argued. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"I thought you were OK with me being gay," she said quietly. Brooke stepped closer.</p>
<p>"Oh, I AM, Sammy. I just don't want to see you date Nicole of all people. You 'affectionately' refer to the girl as Satan for God's sake. You two hate each other," she reminded her.</p>
<p>"You and I hated each other for a long time," Sam said. "Look at us now."</p>
<p>"Apples and oranges, Sam. I have a heart, Nic doesn't. I don't want to see her hurt you."</p>
<p>"Nice way to talk about your best friend," Sam scoffed. Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"She's no friend of mine, not anymore," she said softly. Sam frowned at her.</p>
<p>"See, that's what I don't get. You two were fine until I started dating her. What happened to ruin your friendship? Is it me?" Sam asked. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, it's nothing. Just grew apart. I'm tired of her hurting me, using me and I don't want her to do the same to you." Sam walked over to the blonde and grasped her hand.</p>
<p>"I'm a big girl, Brooke. I appreciate the concern but I can take care of myself. Besides, Nic has made it clear what she wants out of this relationship and I'm OK with that." Brooke looked Sam in the eyes, slightly fearful.</p>
<p>"And that is?" Sam blushed and smirked.</p>
<p>"Fun. She's not looking for a long-term commitment. Just someone to have fun with, that sort of thing," Sam explained shyly.</p>
<p>"Sex," Brooke clarified a bit offended. Sam arched an eyebrow at her.</p>
<p>"If you want to be crude about it, yes there is that," she said curtly.</p>
<p>"Sammy, I thought you were better than that," Brooke accused.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, but what do you really know about me, Brooke? Maybe I want the same thing. Besides, even if I don't, Nicole's a good-looking girl and not a half-bad consolation prize. I can think of worse ways to spend my Friday nights."</p>
<p>"Consolation prize?" Brooke asked. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"Nevermind. The point is I can't have what I want so I'm going with what's offered to me. For now. Why not, you know? Why should I stay home alone when I don't have to?" Sam grabbed her jacket off her bed and headed to the door. "See ya later, Brooke."</p>
<p>"Night Sam," Brooke sighed as Sam left. She didn't have the heart to tell Sam to have a nice time. That was the last thing she wanted.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sam let out a heavy sigh as she drove to Nicole's house. She hated arguing with Brooke and didn't understand why she was doing it so often lately. Brooke had taken the truth about her sexual orientation surprisingly well; the blonde seemed almost relieved. But when she's started dating Nicole, the tension that had long ago faded between her and Brooke resurfaced. They no longer shared their easy flowing banter and Brooke seemed overly tense. And for the life of her, Sam couldn't figure it out.</p>
<p>And then there was whatever was going on between Brooke and Nicole. They went from best friends to worst enemies faster than Sam could say 'boo'. Do not pass Go, do not collect 200 dollars. They were at each other’s throats. Any little thing they could do to the other, they did. Nicole had taken great joy in reminding Brooke that she'd slept with Josh and now Josh was with Lily. While Brooke didn't have feelings for Josh anymore, the fact that Nic had slept with him was still a sore spot. In payback, Brooke had made sure that three of the colleges Nicole had applied to not only got copies of her academic reports, but of her 'extra curricular' activities as well: i.e. cheating on tests, the scandals and such. Needless to say, those were three colleges that would not be accepting Nicole to their fall classes.</p>
<p>While at any other time, watching Brooke rip into Nicole would have been fun, it was disturbing Sam right now. Not because she was dating Nicole. She knew what kind of person Nicole was and knew the shorter blonde more than deserved her comeuppance, but it bothered Sam that something else was really bugging Brooke. Something more than the whole 'Nicole' thing and the head cheerleader wouldn't talk about it.</p>
<p>Sam missed the long talks she and Brooke used to enjoy before all this started. Sometimes late at night when they both couldn't sleep, they'd stay up and just talk about everything and nothing. Like sisters, Sam supposed. But Sam's feelings for Brooke were much more than sisterly. It was her feelings for her blonde housemate that made her face the fact that she was gay. She loved Brooke and knew that she would never have her as anything more than a good friend. It broke her heart to be that close but forever closed off from what she wanted. Brooke was whom she was referring to when she said she couldn't have what she wanted. So when Nicole talked to her about maybe seeing each other outside of school in a dating sense, while Sam was shocked, she had to admit Nic wasn't that bad a second choice. And like she'd told Brooke, all Nic really wanted was 'fun'. And that didn't seem so bad either. If she couldn't have what she wanted, she'd settle for what she could get, for now.</p>
<p>She parked her car at the Julian mansion and went to the door where Clive, the middle-aged butler let her in. He was a nice guy but obviously had a thing against Nicole.</p>
<p>"Miss Julian is in her room, Miss McPherson," he said boredly. "The house belongs to the two of you for the night, the staff has been given off. If you get hungry, Cook left some food in the kitchen for you. If you DO need anything else, including a rabies shot," he mumbled under his breath as Sam smirked slightly. "Feel free to page the guest house and someone will be along shortly. Have a pleasant evening…if that’s possible," he added snidely before leaving.</p>
<p>"Gee, thanks," Sam snickered as she climbed the stairs to Nicole’s room. The beauty of the Julian house never ceased to amaze and enthrall Sam. But aside from being beautiful, the house had a cold aura about it. It wasn’t a home, it was a statement, and it made Sam nervous.</p>
<p>"Nic, you in there?" she called as she knocked on Nicole’s door. While they had no concrete plans, it was unlike Nicole not to be ready when Sam arrived.</p>
<p>"Yes, Sam, come in," Nicole called from the other side of the door. Sam shrugged and opened the door. Her breath caught in her throat as she saw what awaited her. The room was bathed in candles and roses, giving it a soft glow and sweet scent. But it was Nicole in nothing but a sheer red teddy that stole Sam’s breath away. She looked radiant standing beside the bed with a small smile.</p>
<p>"I…I…I…" Sam stuttered in shock. Nicole laughed lowly.</p>
<p>"Ah, articulate as ever I see," she teased. Sam blushed. "Come here, I don’t bite…unless you want me too," she added cheekily. Sam swallowed convulsively and slowly walked over where Nicole gathered the slightly trembling girl in her arms.</p>
<p>"Hey, calm down, Sam. I wanted to surprise you. You said the other day that you thought you were ready for this and I thought tonight would be the perfect time," Nicole explained as she stroked Sam’s back gently. She pulled back and looked into Sam’s rich brown eyes.</p>
<p>"If you’re not ready Sam…" she started but Sam cut her off with a passionate kiss. When they broke apart, Nicole watched amazed as Sam’s eyes got impossibly darker and she stared at the short blonde with a look that made the girl’s knees weak.</p>
<p>"Oh, I’m ready Nic," Sam purred, again making standing difficult for Nicole. Nicole wondered for a moment what the heck she’d gotten wrapped up in. </p>
<p>"Trust me, Nicole, I’m ready."</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter Two">
<p>Brooke was beyond worried. Sam hadn’t come home the night before and the imaginative blonde’s mind was working overtime coming up with reasons why.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;She’s been in an accident. She’s hurt. She’s been kidnapped. She ran away&amp;gt; she fretted. Her stomach turned as she realized the possible real reason why Sam was late.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;She was having SUCH a good time she decided to stay&amp;gt; The very thought of Nicole touching her Sam made Brooke’s skin crawl. She wanted to kill the shorter blonde for her betrayal.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Damn her! She knew how I felt and took advantage of it. If she hurts Sammy through this I’ll…&amp;gt; her thoughts were broken by the sound of the front door closing and footsteps coming up the stairs. Brooke practically ran to her door to see Sam at the top of the stairs looking tired and yet oddly pleased with herself. Her stomach lurched again as she noticed the glazed and satisfied look in Sam’s eyes.</p>
<p>"Hiya Brooke," Sam greeted her sleepily. Brooke sighed and tried to banish both her anger at Nicole and the X-rated images now running through her mind involving what Sam had done that night.</p>
<p>"Sam," she said back. "You’re home late, or should I say early?" Sam arched an eyebrow and shrugged.</p>
<p>"I fell asleep at Nicole’s. I was tired," a wide grin spread across the brunette’s face and Brooke nearly tossed her cookies on the girls’ Doc Marten’s.</p>
<p>"Ew, Sam, please," she complained. "Spare me the imagery." Sam turned to face her fully.</p>
<p>"God, what is your problem Brooke? It’s my life," she pointed out.</p>
<p>"You slept with Nicole! She’s the town’s freaking bicycle, Sam, EVERYONE’S had a ride," Brooke retorted, her earlier anger returning and directed at the wrong source. "You can do better." Sam’s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>"You know, if I didn’t know any better, I’d swear you were jealous," she snapped. "But since we both know you’re ‘better’ than that, I don’t. Yes, I slept with Nicole, and you know what? It was GREAT! Super-freaking-mind-blowing-fantastic! You know what else? Not just once either! Again and again and again," she taunted Brooke. Brooke closed her eyes against the onslaught of tears. She really didn’t want to hear about it.</p>
<p>"Sam, please," she begged.</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact, I haven’t even BEEN to sleep yet. So if you’ll excuse me, I’m exhausted," Sam slammed her bedroom door behind her, leaving Brooke weeping in the hallway.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Nicole smirked evilly at Brooke during school Monday morning. From the look on the taller girl's face, Nicole was sure that Brooke knew what Sam had been up to over the weekend.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Ultimately, I win, Brookie&amp;gt; she snickered to herself. &amp;lt;I got the first shot at your precious Sammy. And WHOO, damn that girl is talented&amp;gt; Despite herself, Nicole felt herself flush at the mere thought of her 'date' with Sam Friday night and Saturday morning. She had definitely gotten in a little further over her head then she'd intended. But never one to be beaten, Nicole figured she'd figure out what was going on and how to handle it later. After all, she was the Queen Bitch. It wouldn't do for this thing with Sam to evolve into more than what she intended it to be.</p>
<p>"Hey you," Sam purred in Nicole's ear from behind, making the shorter girl shudder involuntarily. She tried to force that pesky feeling away as Sam's warm arms wrapped around her waist.</p>
<p>"Hey," she said back nonchalantly. Sam sighed.</p>
<p>"Ah, 'Cold Mode Nicole', I get it," Sam said unwrapping her arms and moving to stand in front of Nicole. She knew the game and as much as she hated it, played along. Nicole managed to successfully hide her disappointment at the loss of contact with Sam.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;I am NOT thinking that way. I am SO not thinking that way&amp;gt; she repeated. &amp;lt;She is an end to justify my means. Nothing more&amp;gt; She looked up into the smirking chocolate eyes and felt a flutter in her stomach.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Damn those eyes. They make me melt and I'm supposed to be beyond that. I think I'm beginning to see what Brooke sees in her, damn it. This could be trouble&amp;gt;</p>
<p>"Plans for tonight?" Sam asked. Nicole cleared her throat and shrugged.</p>
<p>"I've got Glamazon practice but after that, I'm all yours," she said with a small smile. They both jumped and turned at the sound of a locker slamming shut and watched as Brooke stalked away from them.</p>
<p>"God, what is her problem?" Sam asked sounding vaguely hurt. Nicole hid her triumphant smile.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Heh heh, I know what it is, Sammy. Jealousy is a WONDERFUL thing. I'll beat that blonde bimbo yet&amp;gt; Nic laughed to herself.</p>
<p>"Probably sexual frustration. She never should have broken it off with Josh. Don't worry about it, Sam. As soon as she figures out the whole 'manual' thing, she'll be fine."</p>
<p>"NIC!" Sam blushed. Nicole pretended to ignore her.</p>
<p>"Or we could buy her a 'gift'. In the interest of her health, of course," she went on. "There's a shop downtown that specializes in..."</p>
<p>"OVERSHARE," Sam interrupted her, still blushing bright red. Nicole thought it was cute. And then scolded herself for the thought.</p>
<p>"Well, whatever it is, I'm sure she'll get over it," Nicole tossed out with a shrug.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Or not. At any rate, I really could care less&amp;gt; she thought evilly. She wanted to break Brooke anyway that she could and if that meant driving the girl into the ground emotionally, so be it. Whatever it took for Nicole to teach her that SHE was Queen and not Brooke, Nic was willing to do. And God help whoever got in her way. Even Sam.</p>
<p>"So," Sam drawled, breaking Nicole from her plotting. "After practice you're all mine, huh?" Again the tone of Sam's voice made Nicole force down an involuntary shudder. She really wished Sam would stop doing that to her. It didn't bode well for her future plans.</p>
<p>"You bet," she answered. Sam leaned over and brushed her lips against Nicole's. There was no need to hide their relationship, Mary Cherry had alerted the entire school to it. And since no one had the guts to confront or challenge Nicole Julian about it, they were left alone. Nicole sighed as Sam moved and nipped her earlobe.</p>
<p>"I like the sound of that," Sam whispered before releasing the soft flesh and pulling away. "Later Nicole." She left the petite blonde quaking in the hallway.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Oh damn. I think I'm in trouble&amp;gt;</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter Three">
<p>Brooke wiped at her eyes and started to reapply her makeup in the mirror of the Novak. She had tried not to let the little exchange she witnessed between Sam and Nicole bother her, but she couldn't help regretting the fact that it wasn't her standing there being so openly intimate with Sam. She resented Nicole for what she'd taken from her, in Brooke's opinion. And she was highly jealous as well.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Woulda, coulda, shoulda&amp;gt; she mourned silently. &amp;lt;Damn Nicole. If I hadn't been so nervous, so scared of Sam not returning my feelings I would have had a shot. Come to find out, Sam probably would have gone along with me for 'fun' sake, like she is with Nicole. Damn damn damn&amp;gt;</p>
<p>The tears started fresh just as the door opened and the object of Brooke's silent affection walked in. Sam stopped and observed the upset cheerleader for a few seconds before speaking.</p>
<p>"Brooke, are you OK?" she asked quietly. Brooke stared at her in the mirror, the concerned look on Sam's face making her pain even sharper.</p>
<p>"'M fine, Sam," she managed to mutter. Sam walked closer shaking her head.</p>
<p>"I don't believe you. Something is really bothering you and I wish you'd talk to me. But all we do lately is argue and I hate it, Brooke. I HATE fighting with you," Sam confessed as she gathered the stiff blonde into a hug from behind.</p>
<p>"I hate it too, Sammy," Brooke whispered relaxing slightly. Sam rested her head on Brooke's shoulder and they stared at each other in the mirror. Brooke was again distracted by Sam's natural beauty, a habit that happened to her a lot. </p>
<p>"Talk to me, Brooke," Sam pleaded still keeping eye contact. "Let me try and help, please?" Brooke closed her eyes as a few more tears slid down her face, breaking the intense level of eye contact they had.</p>
<p>"Oh, Sam, you can't help. It's beyond both of us," Brooke explained as she turned around in Sam's arms and rested her forehead against Sam's shoulder. Sam felt so warm and comfortable to her, she didn't want to leave the embrace. Sam stroked Brooke's back in comforting circles.</p>
<p>"I don't like the sound of that," Sam said softly. "Come on, what's so bad that the two of us can't figure it out?"</p>
<p>&amp;lt;I desperately love you, Sam. That's what&amp;gt; Brooke thought remorsefully. &amp;lt;But you're dating my former best friend and seem happy. I don't want to pull you in two directions just because I'm jealous and selfish&amp;gt;</p>
<p>"Nothing Sam, I'll be fine," she said out loud a bit stronger. "PMS, I guess." Sam arched an eyebrow at her.</p>
<p>"I still don't believe you but I'm not going to force you to talk to me if you don't want to," she said. Brooke could hear the undercurrent of hurt in Sam's voice and it hit her like a physical blow. She would never want to hurt Sam and yet she just did.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Sam, I just..." she looked up into those rich brown eyes and debated whether or not to tell Sam how she felt. Maybe if she confessed the truth, things would work out in a positive way.</p>
<p>"You ‘just what’, Brooke?" Sam asked patiently.</p>
<p>"I..."</p>
<p>"And what do we have here?" Nicole asked from the doorway. Her hands were on her hips and she had a decidedly unpleased look on her face. Brooke jumped and tried to move away from Sam but Sam's arms were locked around her waist. She was afraid that she was going to get Sam into trouble with Nicole for the embrace. Sam tilted her head and looked at her girlfriend.</p>
<p>"Brooke's upset. I'm trying to find out why," she responded simply. Obviously, Sam saw nothing wrong with what was going on.</p>
<p>"You two look awful cozy," Nicole sneered. Sam shrugged.</p>
<p>"She's my best friend and step sister, Nicole. You know we're close. Get a grip and drop the jealous act, will you?" Sam's words warmed Brooke's insides to an extent. She liked the thought of being Sam's best friend even if it was the best she could get for now. It would have to do. She watched curiously as Nicole's face flushed red.</p>
<p>"I'm not jealous. I think I have a right to be suspicious of the closeness between you," Nicole snapped. Sam laughed, sending the low rumble through Brooke's body.</p>
<p>"Please, Nic. We both know Brooke doesn't think of me that way," she scoffed. Brooke swallowed the sob that almost escaped her at the words and as Sam disengaged her grip on her waist.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Oh Sammy, if only you knew&amp;gt; Brooke sighed to herself.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Yeah Sam, right, if only you knew&amp;gt; Nicole seethed silently.</p>
<p>A silent but intense staring contest erupted between the two blondes as they regarded each other across the bathroom. Sam was mostly oblivious to it as she tried to calm Nicole down.</p>
<p>"Anyway, I mean really, Nic, a rendezvous in the Novak? How...cliched," she snickered. Nicole and Brooke said nothing, just glared at one another, neither willing to back down first. And entire conversation took place within their glances.</p>
<p>Narrowed hazel eyes and a clenched jaw &amp;lt;I hate you for what you've done&amp;gt; </p>
<p>An arched eyebrow and a smirk &amp;lt;Like I care, Queenie? She's mine now and all because you didn't act when you had the chance. I win&amp;gt;</p>
<p>A scowl and a huff of air through the nose &amp;lt;You haven't won yet. I'll fix you, bitch&amp;gt;</p>
<p>A wider smirk &amp;lt;Come and get me. I'd like to see you try&amp;gt;</p>
<p>"Ah, guys? Hello, Earth to the blonde brigade," Sam called to Brooke and Nicole. They both settled their gazes on her. "OK, hi, remember me? We're going to be late for class so if you two are done with the contest to be Alpha Female, can we go?" </p>
<p>"Of course, Sam," Nicole said, slipping her arm around Sam's waist possessively. Brooke nearly growled at the sight as Nicole smiled sweetly at her just to rub it in.</p>
<p>"See you in class, Sam," Brooke ground out through her teeth, not willing to let Nicole beat her down, especially in front of Sam. "And I'll see you at practice, Nicole," her voice dripped with scorn and distaste but Nicole ignored it.</p>
<p>"Later B."</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter Four">
<p>"OK, let's try that AGAIN!" Brooke ordered the Glamazon squad who groaned collectively. "Don't groan at me. Tell Miss Julian to get her ass in gear and maybe the routine won't suck so bad. Maybe you guys don't mind looking like shit at the basketball game, but I DO!"</p>
<p>"Come on, Nicole," Carmen muttered. "Would it kill you to put a LITTLE effort into this? She's going to work us to death unless you do."</p>
<p>"Ah know, Nic. Did y'all break yer groove thang, cuz you ain't got no rhythm an' yer throwin' th' rest of us off," Mary Cherry scolded. Nicole sighed. Really, she was trying but during warm ups, Brooke had 'accidentally' lost her grip on a stand and Nicole had fallen hard to the ground. Now there wasn't a place on her body that didn't hurt. And the grin that flashed across Brooke's face had only made her angrier. But the harder she tried to keep up with Brooke and the routine, the harder Brooke made it for her.</p>
<p>"Tell Drill Sgt. McQueen to back off and maybe then we'll get it right. Freaking perfectionist," she snapped at the two girls.</p>
<p>"Don' go blamin' Brookie cuz yer too tired from playin' wit' yer girlfriend," Mary Cherry shuddered.</p>
<p>"Shut up, Mary Cherry," Nicole ordered.</p>
<p>"Hey, if you three in back are done with the private pow-wow, you want to join the REST of us?" Brooke sneered. Nicole threw her hands in the air in frustration.</p>
<p>"Forget it, Brooke. I'm done for the day. I'm leaving," she announced. Brooke put her hands on her hips and smiled.</p>
<p>"Oh really?" she challenged. Nic looked at her and nodded.</p>
<p>"Really. Now what are YOU going to do about it?" she retorted. Brooke waved sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Bye bye, Nic. You were on probation, remember? One slip up and boom, off the squad. Turn in your jacket and go home, you're through," Brooke gloated triumphantly. Nicole's jaw dropped open and she gaped at the taller blonde.</p>
<p>"WHAT?" she screeched.</p>
<p>"You heard me. Principal Krupps said the first time you were uncooperative or disruptive that you were off the squad. I think walking out on practice for the basketball finals counts as both, don't you?" She didn't give Nicole time to respond. "Hey, Popita, you know the routine?" Popita Fresh, a chronic benchwarmer sprang up from her seat, excited to be remembered and addressed.</p>
<p>"Yes!" the girl chirped confidently.</p>
<p>"Then fall in and let's do this right so we can go home," Brooke said. She smirked at Nicole as the squad started the routine again. "Bye bye," she said out loud. 'I win' she mouthed to the girl as Nicole stalked away.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Take something away from me, Nicole, and I'll do the same to you&amp;gt; Brooke warned silently. &amp;lt;And I'm only getting started&amp;gt;</p>
<hr/>
<p>Nicole watched Sam as she slept, spent after another busy 'date'. The girl was passionate; Nicole had to give her that. And unfortunately, Nicole was feeling things she didn't want to feel. She couldn't let herself get too tangled emotionally with Sam. That wasn't what this relationship was about. Whether Sam knew it or not, Nicole was just using her. And if she ended up with, ew, 'feelings' for the brunette, it would make carrying out her plan to destroy Brooke, claim her throne as well as get revenge on Sam for every expose and biased article the girl had ever written, that much harder. Not that it would stop her, it would just make it that much more difficult.</p>
<p>She sighed and despite her reservations, moved closer to Sam, wanting to feel the warmth of her body. Nicole's world was cold, unfeeling; but Sam was warm and caring and it was something new to Nicole. She found that she craved it and didn't want to let it go.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Yeah, that's all this is. Infatuation with something new&amp;gt; she told herself. &amp;lt;Besides, I'm not capable of caring for anyone but myself and I've worked hard to get that way. I sure as Hell am NOT going to change that for Spam McPherson&amp;gt; </p>
<p>"Mmmm, Nic?" Sam called softly. Nicole brushed the girls’ long hair away from her face and smiled.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" </p>
<p>"What time is it?" Sam asked as she opened her eyes and blinked fuzzily at Nicole.</p>
<p>"A little after 11," Nicole told her.</p>
<p>"Shit, I'm gonna be late for curfew, I gotta go," Sam complained, waking up fully and starting to get up. Nicole pulled her in for a kiss before she got out of the bed.</p>
<p>"I had fun," she said. Sam smiled at her.</p>
<p>"So did I," she smirked. "We should do it again sometime." Nicole nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, how's tomorrow sound?" she asked jokingly. Sam laughed.</p>
<p>"After practice?" she tossed back. Nicole frowned.</p>
<p>"I got thrown off the squad," she whispered. Sam scowled as she pulled on her clothes.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Brooke threw me off the squad. She's on some sort of meglomaniacal powertrip and replaced me with Popita Fresh," Nicole explained. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"Popita still goes to Kennedy?" she said absently. "Anyway, I can't believe Brooke did that. I'll talk to her and see what's up, OK?"</p>
<p>"Don't bother, Sam," Nicole bluffed, loving the thought of Sam and Brooke arguing over this point. It would drive them further apart and it was Brooke's own fault.</p>
<p>"It's not a bother, Nic," Sam said, leaning down and kissing Nic on the end of the nose. "I can't guarantee that you'll get your spot back but maybe I can find out what her problem is."</p>
<p>"If you want to," Nicole sighed dramatically, pouring it on thick for Sam's benefit. And Sam bought it; hook, line, and sinker.</p>
<p>"I want to. Talk to you tomorrow, Nic."</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter Five">
<p>"Brooke, I'm not asking you to reinstate her, just tell me why you booted her off the team," Sam asked as she was getting ready for bed later in the bathroom she shared with Brooke. Brooke sighed and shook her head.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to argue with you about this, Sam. Just leave it alone."</p>
<p>"Brooke, I can't. You know that the Glamazons are important to Nic. Why would you take that away from her?" Sam asked confused. "It's so unlike you."</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Because she took what was important to me, Sam. I wish you could see that&amp;gt;</p>
<p>"Because she was being uncooperative and disruptive. Not to mention the fact that she couldn't keep up with the rest of the squad. I can't let one person drag the rest of us under," Brooke explained. "We've worked too hard to have it all undone because she's not prepared or willing to work."</p>
<p>"OK," Sam nodded. "I can see your point. I just wanted to make sure it had nothing to do with me." Brooke smirked.</p>
<p>"Gee you've got an awfully high opinion of yourself lately," she said playfully. Sam smiled and shrugged.</p>
<p>"Nah. But I'm not stupid either. I see the way you two behave when I'm around. And the fact that your friendship went south when I started dating Nicole clues me in that there's a bigger issue here that you don't want to discuss. OK, fine, I can deal with that. Now, normally, watching you tear Nicole apart would be fun. But even if I wasn't seeing her in a romantic sense, the fact that something else is bothering you would take all the pleasure out of it for me."</p>
<p>"How can you call what you and Nicole do 'dating' anyway?" Brooke asked, switching subjects. Sam blinked at her momentarily confused.</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"I mean, let's be honest, Sam. Do you two even go out anymore? Or do you just stay in?" Sam scowled at her.</p>
<p>"That's really none of your business," she snapped. Brooke sighed again. She hadn't meant to say what she said, it just kind of tumbled out of her mouth as a way to stop Sam's stream of consciousness. And now she regretted it.</p>
<p>"Sam, I don't want to fight. You're right, it isn't my business. I'm sorry I said that. It was mean and crude. Really, I'm sorry," she apologized. Sam's face softened a bit.</p>
<p>"S'OK. Besides, I did taunt you with it. I should have expected some payback. Tell you what: I won't mention it if you don't, deal?" she asked with a grin. Brooke forced herself to smile back and nodded.</p>
<p>"Deal," she agreed. Desperate for another change in topic that was no where near Nicole Julian, Brooke switched gears again.</p>
<p>"Your birthday's coming up, Sam. Any idea what you want?" she asked as she put away her toothbrush. Sam stared at her in surprise. "What?" </p>
<p>"I didn't expect you to remember my birthday," Sam whispered. Brooke frowned.</p>
<p>"Why wouldn't I?" she questioned. Sam looked down and then away as she shrugged.</p>
<p>"I don't know. I guess I didn't think it was all that important to you," Sam answered quietly. Brooke did her best to ignore the flash of pain that raced through her at the statement.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;How could she think she wasn't important to me?&amp;gt; she wondered. &amp;lt;Because you never told her she was, you idiot&amp;gt; she sighed back.</p>
<p>"Sam, it IS important to me. It's your birthday, your special day. And if there's anything in particular that you want that I can get for you, let me know. I want to make it count," Brooke vowed. Sam stared at her with an expression of mixed wonder and appreciation.</p>
<p>"Thanks, Brooke. That means a lot. Sometimes I feel like I get lost in the shuffle with Carmen, Lily, and Harrison. Like my birthday isn't so important as long as I remember theirs. I know that sounds selfish but sometimes it hurts," Sam confessed. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"You should tell them, Sammy. If they're hurting your feelings..." Brooke started. Sam laughed and shook her head.</p>
<p>"Not important," she cut Brooke off. "If I think of anything I want, I'll let you know," she finished heading to her room. "Good night, Brooke."</p>
<p>"Night Sam," Brooke answered as Sam left.</p>
<p>She didn't like the way the conversation had ended. The fact that Sam let the hurt caused by what was probably an innocent mistake on the part of Carmen, Lily and Harrison fester without saying anything bothered her. But then she figured who was she to talk since she was letting the hurt caused by seeing Sam with Nic grow and eat at her like a cancer. But the more she thought about the relationship Sam that had with Nicole, the more Brooke realized she would want something more. She wouldn't be happy with just 'fun'. She wanted all of Sam, not just part of her.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;But Sam's never said that she had actual 'feelings' for Nic&amp;gt; she thought logically. &amp;lt;And if there really isn't any actual emotion for her to base the relationship in, maybe she wouldn't be all that averse to leaving Nicole. Maybe for me?&amp;gt; She shut off the light and crawled into bed, a ray of hope making her heart feel lighter.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;I'm going to have to fight Nicole for her&amp;gt; Brooke decided with a grin. &amp;lt;And I'll have to start by getting Sam the most kick ass birthday present ever. Only thing is, I have NO idea what that might be. Hmmm, I'll have to ask Mom or Lily. Maybe they'll know&amp;gt; She drifted off to sleep, planning how she was going to whisk Sam away from Nicole's evil clutches.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter Six">
<p>&amp;lt;I can't buy her jewelry. She doesn't wear that much. Sam is really a minimalist when it comes to accessories. And I can't buy her clothes. Our taste is just different enough for me to pick the wrong thing. Besides,&amp;gt; Brooke fretted. &amp;lt;With my luck, she'd misinterpret it as me trying to change her or something else equally as ridiculous&amp;gt;</p>
<p>&amp;lt;There has to be something else Sam has always wanted that I can get her. A dream that I can make come true. Everyone has unfulfilled wishes, even me. So there MUST be something Sam pines for&amp;gt;</p>
<p>"Good morning, Brooke," Jane said as she entered the kitchen and found the teen deep in contemplation of her cornflakes.</p>
<p>"Hey Mom," Brooke answered absently as she twirled her spoon in what was now nothing more than soggy mush.</p>
<p>"Big test today?" Jane started cooking some eggs as she spoke to Brooke. Brooke shook her head and tried to join the conversation.</p>
<p>"Huh? What?" Jane laughed.</p>
<p>"I asked if you had a big test today. You seem to be really thinking about something," she explained. Brooke let out a frustrated huff of air through her teeth.</p>
<p>"I don't know what to get Sam for her birthday," she admitted. Jane's eyes lit up in understanding.</p>
<p>"Oh, is that all? Why didn't you just ask? I know there's some computer games and programs that she wants. I can make up a list of a few things," Jane offered. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, those things are great but not what I want. They're too impersonal. I want to get her something special, something meaningful," Brooke clarified. Jane thought that it was wonderful that Brooke was showing such an interest in Sam's birthday.</p>
<p>"That's very sweet of you, Brooke. Do you have ANY clue what that might be?"</p>
<p>"No, Mom. Isn't there ANYTHING she has ever wanted or something she's wanted to do that she's never had the chance to? THAT'S what I want to get for her."</p>
<p>"Why is it so important to you, Brooke?" Jane asked intrigued. It seemed desperately important to Brooke that she get just the right thing and Jane wanted to understand why. Not that she wasn't happy with the sentiment, but she was very curious as to Brooke's motivation. Brooke shrugged.</p>
<p>"It just is. We've gotten so close and she mentioned that sometimes she feels lost in the shuffle. I want her to know that her birthday IS important," Brooke said hastily to cover herself. She was afraid that Jane was getting suspicious about her feelings towards Sam and she couldn't have that. Especially not before Sam knew.</p>
<p>"OK, well," Jane nodded. "Let me think." She paused and shifted through her memories of her spirited daughter to try and find something to help Brooke. But given Sam's independent and guarded nature, it wasn't easy. Then, an old memory bobbed to the surface.</p>
<p>"I remember this one time when Sam was about 7, shortly before her father Joe got sick, he took her to a nearby resort to learn to ski. She loved it. The cold air, the speed, the rush as she went down the hill. And you know Sam. She wasn't satisfied with the bunny slope. Joe had to take her down the moderate hill and I remember he was terrified," Jane laughed at the memory. "But Sam was thrilled."</p>
<p>"Sounds like Sammy," Brooke laughed with her. Jane smiled wider and nodded.</p>
<p>"She loved it so much and was such a natural that Joe promised to take her to Telluride for her next birthday. But he got sick and never got the chance..." Brooke jumped up from her seat.</p>
<p>"That's perfect! Do you think she'd still be interested?"</p>
<p>"Probably. She mentions it every once in a great while, and loves to watch the skiing events in the Winter Olympics. But, Brooke, that's way too expensive," Jane tried to dissuade her. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, no it won't be. My mom's brother Eric works lives near Telluride and has a big cabin there. He's always said that anytime I wanted to use the cabin I was welcome and that he'd help me get vouchers and all that stuff. I'll just call and clear it with him. Yes! This is perfect!" she hugged Jane. "Thank you SO much, Mom."</p>
<p>"You're welcome, Brooke. I'm sure it'll mean a lot to her."</p>
<p>"I hope so."</p>
<hr/>
<p>&amp;lt;God, Spam's birthday is this week. I have to get her a good gift or I know that bitch Brooke will make me look bad by one-upping me. I could buy her some jewelry. Sam could use the help learning how to accessorize. Or I could buy her a whole new wardrobe. God knows she's got awful taste&amp;gt; Nicole sighed. She hated sentimental occasions like birthdays, Valentine's, anniversaries, and the like. Not a lot of attention was paid to them in her family so she was at a loss as to how to deal with them.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Eh, I'll think of something. I always do. I'll just throw out some money and see where it lands. That's my biggest advantage over Brooke. Money solves all problems&amp;gt; she smirked. &amp;lt;Well, money and sex&amp;gt; She turned to the person sitting beside her.</p>
<p>"Ready to go, hot stuff?" she asked seductively. A pair of green eyes sparkled back.</p>
<p>"When you are," his deep baritone answered back. Nicole took the guy's hand, Ben she thought his name was, and headed towards the door of the club. If there was one way to banish her growing feelings for Sam, it was to feel something else entirely.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter Seven">
<p>Sam had decided against having a big birthday party, opting instead for just a family dinner. Not even Nicole was invited to the outing, which made Brooke very, very happy. And Nicole very, very jealous.</p>
<p>The family went to dinner at Sam's favorite restaurant and had a great time. She got clothes, CDs and computer programs from her mother and Mike, as well as a new; leather bound journal to write in. From Brooke she received a beautiful amethyst necklace that made her gasp to look at. It was stunning in color and cut and Sam knew by looking at it that it couldn't have been cheap.</p>
<p>"God, Brooke, you shouldn't have," she said in awe. Brooke blushed.</p>
<p>"Do you like it? Because I can return it if you don't. I know jewelry isn't your thing..." Brooke babbled.</p>
<p>"I love it," Sam interrupted her, putting the necklace on to prove her point. "Really, thank you."</p>
<p>"You're welcome," Brooke's blush deepened.</p>
<p>"Brooke, don't you have something else for Sam?" Mike asked with a wide smile. He was almost more excited than Brooke was. Sam's eyes got wide.</p>
<p>"More? No, Brooke, really you shouldn't..." Brooke handed Sam a plain manila folder which Sam eyed carefully.</p>
<p>"It's not full of Anthrax, is it?" she asked with a smirk. Everyone laughed.</p>
<p>"Ha ha, Sam. No, just open it," Brooke giggled. She was nearly bouncing from excitement. Sam smiled and opened the envelope, pulling out a brochure.</p>
<p>"'Your All Access Guide to Telluride'? What's this?" she asked confused. Brooke grinned.</p>
<p>"See what else is in there, Sam," she advised. Sam reached in again and pulled out vouchers for skiing and snowboarding rentals and lessons, meals at the best local restaurants, tickets to a few local shows, and much more.</p>
<p>"It's a complete vacation package to Telluride," Sam said still stupefied. Brooke handed over two more pieces of paper.</p>
<p>"Two first class plane tickets?" Sam exclaimed. She stared at Brooke shocked. "Is this for real?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Sammy, very real. Do you like it?" Brooke asked worried. She knew Sam was touchy when it came to stuff having to do with her father and she hoped that she hadn't just overstepped some unseen boundary.</p>
<p>"I...I...I...how did you know?" Sam whispered as tears streaked unchecked down her face and she stared at the tabletop. Brooke shot a panicked look at Jane, afraid that she had just ruined everything.</p>
<p>"I told her, honey," Jane said gently. "She wanted to get the perfect gift for you and I remembered that skiing trip you took with your dad."</p>
<p>"The necklace would have been more than enough," Sam sniffled.</p>
<p>"I can get refunds on everything if you hate the idea, Sam," Brooke said, fighting her own tears. "I never meant to hurt you or ruin your birthday." Sam shook her head and lifted it to look at Brooke.</p>
<p>"You haven't. It isn't that," the look of gratitude on her face shocked Brooke. "It's just...it just means so much because I never thought I'd get the chance. I can never repay this, Brooke." Brooke smiled, relieved.</p>
<p>"It's a gift, Sam. You don't repay gifts," she said with a happy sigh. A strange look passed over Sam's face.</p>
<p>"Two tickets? You're going with me, right Brooke?" Although stated as a question, the force behind it left no doubt as to which answer Sam wanted. Brooke smiled widely and nodded. Her insides fluttered with happiness.</p>
<p>"Of course, if you want me to."</p>
<p>"Yes, I want you to. You went through all this trouble. It wouldn't be fair if you didn't get to share in the fun," Sam declared, getting up and giving Brooke the biggest hug known to mankind. Mike and Jane watched happily.</p>
<p>"Looks like our little family is finally coming together, doesn't it?" Mike beamed at Jane.</p>
<p>"It does, doesn't it?" she grinned back.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter Eight">
<p>"A skiing trip? She fucking sprung for a skiing trip?" Nicole seethed as she paced the Novak like a caged panther and Mary Cherry watched mesmerized.</p>
<p>"I mean, can you believe that? A complete ski package for two...and Brookie plans on being the person who goes with her! How cozy," she scoffed bitterly.</p>
<p>Nicole had barely been able to believe her ears when Sam had called her the night before, excited to the point of annoying her, to squeal in delight about Brooke's gifts. The necklace alone was enough to make Nicole mad, but the trip absolutely enraged her.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;How dare that bitch think that she can take MY girlfriend on a romantic trip for two? And she just expects me to roll over and take it. I think NOT&amp;gt;</p>
<p>"Ah know," Mary Cherry added. "Jus' think, youah girlfreyand an' that blonde hussy homewrecker, cozyin' up by a roarin' fireplace. Wrapped up in a big ol' quilt, their young, nubile bodies pressed tagether providin' body heat ta chase away th' chill o'..."</p>
<p>"SHUT UP!" Nicole screamed as she shut her eyes against the onslaught of images that Mary Cherry's rant provided her with. She could see in her mind's eye Brooke putting the moves on Sam and Sam whole heartedly accepting it. The very thought of Brooke touching Sam in any sort of intimate way was enough to make Nicole physically ill. And that fact scared her. She didn't want to be THAT jealous of Brooke. It would give Brooke power that Nicole couldn't afford for her to have. And yet it was all she could think of.</p>
<p>"If she thinks that I'm just going to nod my head and move out of her way as she puts the moves on MY girl, she's got another thing coming," she declared.</p>
<p>"Jus' th' thought o' those two involved inna incestuous, carnal rendezvous...their hot, sweaty, panting bodies tangled tagether..."</p>
<p>"MARY CHERRY SHUT UP! YOU AREN'T HELPING!" Nicole glared at her. "And stop watching so many damn porn movies. I think they're rotting your brain." Mary Cherry actually had the grace to blush at this. They were silent for a few minutes as Nicole continued to pace.</p>
<p>"It's too bad y'all cain't jus' go wit' 'em," Mary Cherry offered quietly, afraid of setting Nicole off again. "Two's company, three's a crowd an' all. Unless it IS a porno..." she trailed off as Nicole glared in her direction again. Nic then stopped to think about the idea.</p>
<p>"Hmmm, you may have something there," she started. "I'm sure I could arrange something. But, if I just suddenly show up, Sam will know that I'm up to something and that'll put a crimp in my plans. She's not stupid...not bright but not stupid either. No, there has to be another spin I can put on it to make it seem like I'm doing her a favor and not trying to outdo Brooke," she thought out loud.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Now, how can I do this?&amp;gt; she wondered. &amp;lt;Besides, I think if it was just me, Sam and Brooke, blood will get spilled...and it won't be mine&amp;gt;</p>
<p>"I know!" she exclaimed suddenly, making Mary Cherry jump. "As much as I loathe the idea, I'll spring for all her loser friends to go too. That way they can share in the little trip down memory lane with her. And you and I, of course, Mary Cherry." Mary Cherry nodded.</p>
<p>"First class, right, Nic?" Nicole nodded.</p>
<p>"Of course. Let the losers sit in coach. Shit, let them sit in the cargo hold for all I care. Yeah, I'll arrange for all of us to go and surprise Sam. She'll love it. She'll get to live out her father's promise with all her little friends," she said distastefully. "And I'll get to keep an eye on Brooke and make sure she knows what's mine." Mary Cherry arched an eyebrow at her.</p>
<p>"Nic, do ya actually LIKE Spammy er somethin'? Cuz yer awful possessive," she pointed out. Nicole's glare could have melted steel and Mary Cherry wisely shrunk away.</p>
<p>"Shut up you twit. We both know I'm just using her to get at Brooke and take control of the school. Control that should have been mine to begin with. But I can't let Brooke screw up my plans by getting in the way and making a play for Sam. Remember that, you backwater bumpkin," she snapped. "I do not care for Spam. She's just a tool. Got it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Nic."</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter Nine">
<p>After landing at the airport, Brooke drove the rental car through Telluride, showing Sam the town. Brooke had a pretty good idea where things were even though it'd been years since she'd last visited her uncle. She pointed out some sights, watching as Sam's entire face lit up like she was that seven year old little girl again, finally having a dream come true. It made Brooke feel unbelievably good to know that she was bringing Sam such immense happiness. Even more so knowing how precious Sam's memories of her father were and getting the chance to fulfill a promise that he had made to her.</p>
<p>It took them forty more minutes to drive all the way from Telluride to the cabin; it was so off the beaten path. But Sam was instantly taken with it. It was a large two story home, built using the rustic look of logs. A large deck circled the entire thing and it overlooked a breathtaking vista of the mountains on one side. Although town was under an hour away by car, Sam felt like she was at the edge of the world, and loved it.</p>
<p>"God, Brooke, it's beautiful," she gasped as she exited the car. She took a deep breath, letting the cold snowy air fill her lungs and make her shiver slightly. The air was so clear and crisp, drastically different from the smog and haze from LA and Sam took several minutes to breathe it in, just enjoying it.</p>
<p>"I'm glad you like it, Sam," Brooke smiled, watching as Sam closed her eyes and breathed deeply. The brunette looked so contented and happy that Brooke almost laughed. They'd only just arrived and yet she couldn't remember ever seeing such joy on Sam's face. She was almost glowing.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Not as beautiful as you are right now, though Sam&amp;gt; she thought silently. Sam's eyes opened again and focused on Brooke.</p>
<p>"Have I thanked you enough for this trip?" she asked with a grin. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"Wait and see if you have a good time or not, Sam. THEN thank me," she answered. Sam laughed.</p>
<p>"I'm sure we're going to have a great time, Brooke. How can we not?" she said, coming back over to the car to start unpacking. "Fresh air, snow, skiing, a roaring fireplace..."</p>
<p>"Hot chocolate," Brooke added.</p>
<p>"Hot tubs," Sam mentioned. Brooke's eyebrows raised.</p>
<p>"Hmm, sounds good," she mumbled as the image of Sam in a bathing suit and hot tub played in her mind.</p>
<p>"And terrific company. Face it, Brooke. We're doomed to a fabulous vacation," Sam smirked as she lifted a suitcase. "And who would have thought? You and me on a mountain getaway?" She stopped and turned to Brooke, her face suddenly serious.</p>
<p>"And, by the way, I really am glad it's you that came with me, Brooke," she said quietly. "I miss spending time with you." Brooke blushed and nodded.</p>
<p>"Me too, Sam. This is a great opportunity to catch up," she said. </p>
<p>&amp;lt;And maybe I can get you to look at me in the same light you do Nicole&amp;gt;</p>
<hr/>
<p>If Sam was in love with the outside of the cabin, she was in serious lust with the inside. Open and airy, the cabin was breathtaking. It had the look of an old log cabin but with all the technological advances to make it comfortable. Two bathrooms, one hot tub on the ground floor encased in a glass porch, 5 bedrooms, a huge living room and a fully stocked kitchen. She walked around the cabin in a state of awe.</p>
<p>"Jeeze, and I thought the outside was gorgeous," she breathed. "Your uncle spared no expense, huh?" Brooke shrugged.</p>
<p>"I guess not. But there's no phone, just a CB radio. He likes to be comfortable but hates the whole, 'cell phone, fax, computer, modem' thing," she said. "So if we need to contact anyone, we just have to fire the thing up and call out. Don't worry, I know how to use it."</p>
<p>"Hmm, hidden talents, huh McQueen?" Sam teased lightly as she continued to walk around. Brooke couldn't help the slight blush she felt rise to her cheeks at Sam's question. She figured Sam meant it innocently enough but a certain hidden meaning immediately sprang to mind.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Eh, what the Hell? Let's see if she's in a flirty mood&amp;gt; Brooke decided. &amp;lt;Gotta start somewhere and I only have a week to try and get her to look at me as someone other than a friend&amp;gt;</p>
<p>"Wouldn't you like to know?" she shot back, carefully gauging Sam's reaction. Sam turned to face her and arched an eyebrow, a slight smirk crossing her face.</p>
<p>"Oh really? We're in a mood today," she taunted. "And what if I WANT to know?" Sam joked back, watching, as Brooke blushed redder.</p>
<p>"Ugh..." &amp;lt;Damn, didn't think she'd take the bait so early&amp;gt; Brooke panicked.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I THOUGHT so," Sam laughed. She walked up closer to Brooke, nearly brushing shoulders with the slightly taller blonde. </p>
<p>"Careful who you tease, Brooke," she warned in a low but pleasant tone. "Unless you can take what you dish out." And with that, she went back to the car for more bags, leaving Brooke mildly panicked in the kitchen of the cabin.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Shit! I wasn't expecting her to play back&amp;gt; Brooke thought. &amp;lt;I wasn't ready! Damn it, damn it! Lost a perfect opportunity there because I wasn't ready. Well, at least I know she's willing to at least joke around with me&amp;gt;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sam was shaking her head and wondering what was wrong with her.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;What the Hell am I doing? Brooke's straight and was just playing but damn, my mind is SO in the gutter that I wanted her to be implying more. I'm lucky she didn't rip into me for that little comment. I hope she's not mad. That'll make this whole vacation totally blow&amp;gt;</p>
<p>She walked back into the house and found Brooke still standing where she left her.</p>
<p>"Are you gone help me, Princess? Or am I your slave?" she teased, testing Brooke for a reaction. Brooke blinked rapidly at her for a second and then smiled.</p>
<p>"You're not my slave, Sammy," she said heading out to the car. "Unless you're into that sort thing," she called back. Sam's eyes got wide.</p>
<p>"Ha...?"</p>
<p>&amp;lt;I think the change in altitude is affecting my brain because I could SWEAR Brooke's flirting with me&amp;gt; Sam shook her head. &amp;lt;And I KNOW that can't be right&amp;gt;</p>
<p>She was still standing there confused when a snowball came sailing in and hit her in the chest. She looked back up at Brooke who was standing outside the door trying to look innocent.</p>
<p>"Now who's napping? Wakey wakey," she mocked Sam. Sam's eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>"Oh you are in SO much trouble!" she threatened before taking off chasing Brooke. Brooke let out a yelp and starting running. She managed to avoid Sam for several tense minutes as the brunette chased her but eventually, Sam tackled her into the snow.</p>
<p>"Gotcha!" Sam declared. Brooke giggled and squirmed trying to get away.</p>
<p>"Where do you think you're going, blondie? I owe you," Sam informed her. Brooke stopped squirming and watched in horror as Sam grabbed a fistful of snow, pulled open the front of her jacket and shoved it down.</p>
<p>"SAAAAAAAAAAM!" she shrieked as the cold snow hit her warm skin. "GOD that's cold!" she complained breathless.</p>
<p>"Serves you right," Sam teased. "I thought you needed cooling off anyway," she laughed, sitting back on her haunches, still slightly straddling Brooke. Brooke looked up at her and pretended to pout.</p>
<p>"Cheat," she accused. Sam frowned.</p>
<p>"How's that? I caught you fair and square."</p>
<p>"I let you catch me," Brooke taunted cheekily. Sam's jaw opened wide.</p>
<p>"Oh you did, did you?" Brooke nodded. "Well, we'll have to see about that." She stood up and offered her hand to Brooke, pulling her to her feet. Brooke shook out the last of the snow from her shirt.</p>
<p>"Oh that was mean," she said to Sam as she shivered. Sam smirked.</p>
<p>"No, Brooke, THIS is mean," she pulled the waistband of Brooke's jeans out a bit and poured the hidden handful of snow down the gap. Brooke jumped, screamed and twisted away as Sam collapsed laughing. After recovering from her frozen shock, Brooke glared at the hysterical brunette.</p>
<p>"I'll get you for that," she growled. Sam wiped away the laughter-induced tears and nodded.</p>
<p>"Come and get me," she said saucily. "I look forward to it."</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter Ten">
<p>After getting settled in, and Brooke changed into dry clothes, they sat down to lunch enjoying the easy flowing banter flying between the two of them. Some comments were innocent, others plainly weren't but neither cared. It had been so long since they'd had a chance to sit down and talk without any interference that they were drinking in the opportunity. </p>
<p>As they talked, Sam watched Brooke's facial expressions. It was something she enjoyed doing when no one else was around. Sometimes she could tell more from the blonde cheerleader's face than she could with what Brooke actually said. When Brooke was really comfortable and happy, her face and eyes were an open book, conveying so many more emotions than she was probably aware of. And Sam loved it. </p>
<p>So as Brooke talked about this and that, and flirted (because Sam was sure now that that was what it was), Sam searched her face for a clue was to what was going on in the other girl's mind.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Is she just playing, being a friend? Because I know friends flirt with one another sometimes when they truly trust each other. It doesn't mean anything then. I shouldn't be reading more into it than that. I'm just torturing myself with what I can't have. It's just...I do love her. Very much&amp;gt;</p>
<p>Brooke saw a shadow of what she could only call pain pass through Sam's eyes and wondered what caused it. She was watching Sam study her intently, enjoying the attention and the look of wonder on Sam's face until that point. </p>
<p>"You all right, Sam?" she asked, breaking Sam from her thoughts. Sam smiled.</p>
<p>"I'm fine. Why?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. You just looked like you...left for a second there," Brooke said softly.</p>
<p>"Sorry. Got caught up in a thought," she sighed. Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"It's OK. So what do you want to do today? We still have plenty of time if you wanna hit the resort for some evening skiing or something in town," Brooke suggested.</p>
<p>"If it's OK with you, I think I'd just like to hang out here at the cabin. Get used to the place. Spend time with you," Sam finished in a low whisper. Brooke's breath caught in her throat at that statement.</p>
<p>"There's nothing I'd like more, Sammy," she responded also in a whisper. Sam smiled brightly at her. They grinned at each other like a couple of fools for several minutes.</p>
<p>"Well, help me clear the table and I'll give you a better tour of the place," Brooke finally said, breaking the comfortable silence.</p>
<p>"You got it."</p>
<hr/>
<p>"I can't freaking believe this! What do you mean DELAYED?" Nicole screamed at the ticket clerk. The clerk winced and sighed.</p>
<p>"Delayed. As in 'not on time', 'leaving at a later time', also as in, 'take a seat and get out of my face before I have security drag you out of here for the shear pleasure of watching'," the clerk responded, not at all impressed by Nicole's blustery attitude. Nicole huffed angrily and stormed back over to her seat in the waiting area next to Mary Cherry.</p>
<p>"Calm down, Nicole. Don't have a stroke," Lily said patiently. "We'll get there when we get there. Sam'll be surprised either way." Nicole glared intensely at the diminutive Latina.</p>
<p>"If I want your opinion, Lily, I'll give it to you," she snapped. Lily stuck out her tongue and went back to her magazine. </p>
<p>"Nic, yer drawin' attention ta yerself," Mary Cherry warned. </p>
<p>"I'm playing the part of jealous girlfriend, Mary Cherry," she hissed. She put her head back on the seat behind her and sighed.</p>
<p>"Damn it! They're alone up there. God knows what Brooke is filling her head with," she mumbled for only Mary Cherry to hear.</p>
<p>"Thoughts an' suggestions o' unpure actions an' unwanted sexual advances...touchin' yer Spammy in ways...makin' her arch inta her hands an'..."</p>
<p>"I'm going to hurt you if you don't shut up," Nicole warned lifting her head. Mary Cherry quietly went back to her copy of Vogue.</p>
<p>"Lily, something's up with Nicole," Carmen whispered. "Or rather, Nicole is UP to something." Lily nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah, definitely. This whole trip thing smells fishy. I mean if Brooke wanted us to go, she would have invited us in the first place," Lily agreed.</p>
<p>"And yet you agreed to go now," Harrison pointed out from the next seat. Both girls glared at him.</p>
<p>"To keep Nicole from causing damage to Brooke or Sam," Carmen commented as explanation.</p>
<p>"Please," Harrison scoffed. "Nic is her girlfriend. She wouldn't harm Sam. And as for Brooke, why would she?" Carmen and Lily just rolled their eyes.</p>
<p>"Men, you have absolutely no clue, do you?" Lily said sarcastically.</p>
<p>"Clue about what, honey?" Josh looked up from his Gameboy.</p>
<p>"I rest my case," Lily sighed.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter Eleven">
<p>"God, it's beautiful out here," Sam sighed staring up at the clear night sky, lit only by dozens upon dozens of sparkling stars. She was standing on the deck outside the house in just a sweater, shivering slightly in the cold night air. Brooke walked up behind her.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it is," she agreed. She saw Sam shiver out of the corner of her eye. "Sam, go get a jacket. It can get really cold out here, really quick." Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"I'm fine," she said with a smile. "Thanks for the concern, though." Brooke walked closer and wrapped her arms around Sam from behind.</p>
<p>"This OK?" she asked carefully. Sam snickered.</p>
<p>"Gonna keep me warm yourself, huh?" she joked even as her heart fluttered.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Oh God, I wish&amp;gt; she lamented. Brooke set her chin on Sam's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Heh, you wish," she whispered into Sam's ear. Sam shivered again, and this time not from the cold.</p>
<p>"What did I tell you about teasing?" she warned with a chuckle.</p>
<p>"And what if I can take what I dish out? Huh? What then?" Brooke asked with a definite taunt and promise in her tone. Sam turned around in her arms, a questioning look on her face.</p>
<p>"Brooke," she started, lowering her gaze from the surprisingly open and intense hazel stare she'd encountered. She could have almost sworn she saw something in Brooke's gaze that she daren't hope was really there. If she were forced to name it, Sam would have almost called it love. But she couldn't let herself think that way. She didn't want to feel the pain of knowing Brooke was only teasing and didn't feel the same way she did.</p>
<p>"Yes, Sam?" Brooke prompted when Sam was quiet for a few minutes. That look of pain had flashed across those brown eyes again and Brooke hated seeing it. But she couldn't understand what was causing it.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Maybe being here is turning out to be a painful reminder of her father's death&amp;gt; Brooke wondered. &amp;lt;God, I hope I haven't hurt her like that&amp;gt;</p>
<p>"Brooke, I'm really enjoying being here, being here with you," Sam began again. Brooke grinned widely at hearing that. </p>
<p>"That's a good thing, Sam," she joked. Sam sighed.</p>
<p>"I know. And I'm loving this 'thing' that's going on between us. It's fun. I feel so comfortable with you and I wouldn't trade that for anything. But you know some of the things we've both said can be interpreted in a rather...lewd context. And well, you know that my sexual preference is for girls..." she bit her lip and sighed again.</p>
<p>"Keep going, Sam, I'm listening," Brooke said when she saw Sam was becoming uncomfortable. Her arms were still wrapped tightly around Sam's waist, giving Sam silent support.</p>
<p>"Well, I just...I'm worried that I'll say or do the wrong thing and offend you or something. And I really don't want to do that."</p>
<p>"Sam, there's nothing you can do or say that's going to upset or offend me. I swear," Brooke promised lifting Sam's chin with her finger so that their eyes met again. "Don't worry about that. I told you that I was OK with you being gay and I meant it. I trust you, Sam. And part of that trust includes being able to say the things that we say."</p>
<p>"So you understand what I was trying to say?" Sam asked with a lopsided smile. Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Oh good. For a second there I was afraid I wasn't making any sense," Sam said with a giggle.</p>
<p>"Sam, you rarely make sense," Brooke teased her. Sam mock glared at her and stuck out her tongue. "Hey, now...unless you intend to use that thing..."</p>
<p>"BROOKE!" Sam blushed. </p>
<p>"Hey, you walked RIGHT into that one," Brooke laughed. Sam put her forehead on Brooke's shoulder for a second as she laughed too.</p>
<p>"Yeah, you're right," Sam said as she secretly inhaled Brooke's scent. In the crisp mountain air, Brooke smelled heavenly to her. A few minutes later, she pulled away and sneezed.</p>
<p>"Let's go inside, Sam," Brooke suggested as the chill began to seep into her bones. "Before you catch something and spend the entire vacation with a runny nose."</p>
<p>"Oh, inviting me in? Is that an offer, Ms McQueen?" Sam joked, getting right back into the game. Brooke smirked at her.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't YOU like to know?"</p>
<hr/>
<p>"First that blonde BITCH takes my girl on a ski vacation, then my flight gets delayed, now you tell me that you're out of honey roasted peanuts?" Nicole raved angrily. "What kind of crappy airline is this?"</p>
<p>"Miss, if you just calm down..." the stewardess tried to pacify the irate blonde.</p>
<p>"Calm down? CALM DOWN? Let me tell you a thing or two, Missy!" Nicole screamed as the other first class passengers rolled their eyes almost as one entity.</p>
<p>"Nic, simmah down now," Mary Cherry requested, wanting to avoid a scene on the plane. She was having vivid images of herself and Nicole on the eleven o'clock news being hauled off to jail for causing a disturbance on a flight. </p>
<p>&amp;lt;Ah'm too young an' perty ta be a jailhouse whore&amp;gt; she fretted.</p>
<p>"Mary Cherry, shut up," Nicole hissed. Mary Cherry shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, yer makin' an ass o' yerself. Now sit down an' shut up!" Nicole blinked at her in surprise.</p>
<p>"Excuse me?" she said incredulously.</p>
<p>"You heard me. We'll be in Telluride soon enough. Sit down and calm down 'fore ya get us arrested, 'kay? Save yer anger and vitriol fer Brookie. Lord knows what she's doin' to yer Spammy..." Nicole's face turned red. She then sighed and closed her eyes. The stewardess took advantage of the opportunity to escape quietly to the back.</p>
<p>"Why do you insist on reminding me of that?" she asked, her voice taking on a somewhat hurt tone that surprised Mary Cherry.</p>
<p>"Keep tha' in mind is awl Ah'm sayin', Nic. Yer letting yer anger and jealousy er whatever get in yer way. Yer comin' across as more than an upset girlfriend. Yer comin' across as a jealous lover," Mary Cherry pointed out.</p>
<p>"I am," Nicole bit out. Mary Cherry frowned.</p>
<p>"But Ah thought you didn' care fer Spammy as anythin' more than a tool."</p>
<p>"I don't."</p>
<p>"Ah'm confused," Mary Cherry complained. Nicole opened her eyes and glared at the Southerner.</p>
<p>"Good, that makes two of us."</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter Twelve">
<p>Brooke woke Sam early the next morning for a breakfast of waffles and cream. Sam stumbled down the stairs groggily.</p>
<p>"Come and get it, Sammy," Brooke called to the still sleepy girl yawning at the bottom of the stairs.</p>
<p>"What? No breakfast in bed?" Sam joked as she sat down. Brooke smirked.</p>
<p>"Maybe later, if you're lucky," she teased. Sam's eyebrows wagged as she smiled at Brooke and dug into the waffles.</p>
<p>"Mmmmm, Brooke, these are good," she sighed as she chewed. Brooke grinned.</p>
<p>"Thanks, I opened the box myself," she joked.</p>
<p>"Well, at any rate it tastes fantastic," Sam repeated around a mouthful. "So what’s on the agenda for today?" Brooke shrugged.</p>
<p>"Whatever you feel like, Sam. It’s your vacation," she responded. Sam thought for a minute.</p>
<p>"Well, I would like to see if I remember how to ski," she said. "Interested?"</p>
<p>"You bet," Brooke nodded. "We’ll head to town after breakfast and make a day of it, OK?"</p>
<p>"Sounds like a plan, Stan," Sam chirped as she poured an obscene amount of cream on her waffles.</p>
<p>"Sam! Want some waffles with your cream?" Brooke teased. Sam smirked.</p>
<p>"Eh, if I must," she sighed dramatically. Brooke reached across the table to wipe a spot of cream from the corner of Sam’s mouth. They both froze as they realized what she was doing.</p>
<p>"You uh…have some cream…there," Brooke stuttered, drawing her hand away. Sam stared at her, keeping her features schooled blank. Her heart had fluttered wildly when she saw Brooke reaching out to her. Without thinking, she licked the cream off her cheek. Brooke looked away. That image was almost too much for her.</p>
<p>"So, uhm…after breakfast, why don’t you get cleaned up and then we’ll go into town? We’ll check out the slopes for a bit and when we get tired or hungry we can check out the town," Brooke suggested as she cleared her own plate. Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"OK."</p>
<hr/>
<p>The day progressed well for the two of them. It didn’t take long for Sam to get the hang of skiing again and before long she was hitting the slopes along side Brooke. They spent most of the afternoon racing each other down the hill, challenging the other and having a lot of fun. Around mid-afternoon though, Sam’s stomach made it’s presence known.</p>
<p>"Ah, I take it the fuel tank is empty?" Brooke joked upon hearing a particularly loud rumble from Sam’s direction. Sam blushed and nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I think we should get lunch soon."</p>
<p>"OK. I know a great steak house about a mile from here. Wanna check it out? Afterward we can either check out the town or head back to the house," Brooke suggested.</p>
<p>"House please. I’m chilled to the bone and I can just hear that hot tub calling my name," Sam sighed in thought. "I just want to slip into the hot water and soak away any aches and pains I may have caused myself." Brooke tried to ignore the wonderful imagery Sam just supplied her with but to no avail. Pictures of Sam reclining in the hot tub in her bathing suit, or possibly sans suit floated through her mind and caused a flush to rise to her cheeks.</p>
<p>"You OK, Brooke?" Sam asked when Brooke closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Brooke opened her eyes surprised that she’d lost herself that far in her daydream and nodded embarrassed.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I’m fine. Just thinking. Come on, let’s turn in our skis and go eat."</p>
<hr/>
<p>Nicole paced the package claim booth seething. Lily almost swore she could see smoke coming from the petite blonde’s ears. She had no idea what could have Nicole so riled up.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Unless there’s something here that I’m not clued into&amp;gt; she thought to herself. &amp;lt;Is there something going on between Sam and Brooke? Or is it just a product of Nicole’s paranoid imagination? I’m going to have to pay close attention to this one&amp;gt;</p>
<p>"We went from LA to here on ONE PLANE! How can you lose a bag when we only took ONE PLANE?" Nicole screeched. "And why does it have to be my bag?" she added quieter and somewhat defeated. She was absolutely sure now that someone was out to get her, to stop her from getting to Sam before Brooke turned her head. There was too much going wrong for her to think otherwise.</p>
<p>"Relax Nic, they’ll find it," Josh said happily as he looked around. "Not like it could have gone anywhere."</p>
<p>"Here’s your bag, Miss. Sorry for the delay," the baggage clerk chirped cheerfully. "Your shuttle is waiting to take you to the address you specified. You should reach it by nightfall." Nicole groaned.</p>
<p>"Nightfall. By then, who knows what may have happened," she complained to herself.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter Thirteen">
<p>Sam eased her body down into the steaming hot water, letting out a low hiss as it scalded her slightly. She loved that feeling when her skin felt like it was pulling tight and got hot all over. She lowered herself down until the water came up over her shoulders and only her head was dry. Her hair was piled on top of her head to keep it out of the tub as she soaked. She kind of wished Brooke would join her but the blonde hadn’t seemed interested. </p>
<p>&amp;lt;Too bad, I would have loved to have shared this with her&amp;gt; Sam smiled. &amp;lt;And seen that body in a bathing suit up close&amp;gt; She sighed. &amp;lt;Shame on me. I shouldn’t think that way but I can’t help it. Being with her, just the two of us and getting to spend so much time with her is only making my feelings for her stronger. She is so sweet and beautiful. Why am I settling for Nic? Oh yeah, because I can never have Brooke&amp;gt;</p>
<p>"Damn it," Sam swore quietly.</p>
<p>"What’s wrong, Sammy?" Brooke asked as she approached the tub wrapped in a robe. Sam stared at her for a second before recovering.</p>
<p>"Nothing," she bluffed. Brooke nodded and removed her robe revealing a tight red bikini underneath. Sam felt her breath catch at the beauty that was Brooke McQueen.</p>
<p>"Mind if I join you? You looked so relaxed and comfortable that I just couldn’t resist," Brooke said with a wink. Sam was incapable of speaking so she just shook her head as she continued to stare at Brooke. She watched as Brooke lowered herself into the water opposite her.</p>
<p>"God, you’re beautiful," tumbled out of Sam’s mouth before she could stop it. Brooke jumped slightly at the whispered compliment and then blushed.</p>
<p>"Sam…" she started as a small smile crossed her lips. Knowing that Sam thought she was attractive made her very happy.</p>
<p>"I am so sorry, Brooke. I shouldn’t have said that," Sam panicked. She was petrified that Brooke would be offended or think she was coming on to her. Brooke tilted her head.</p>
<p>"Why? Was it a lie?" Brooke asked quietly. Sam picked up her head to look Brooke in the eye and found the blonde watching her intently. She squirmed slightly under the gaze.</p>
<p>"No, it’s the truth," she admitted softly. "I just don’t want you to think the wrong thing."</p>
<p>"Do you think I’m beautiful?" Brooke asked carefully. She didn’t want to spook Sam but she saw an opportunity and wanted to take advantage of it. If she could get Sam to admit that maybe there was something more than friendship between them, she would tell Sam how she felt.</p>
<p>"Yes," Sam whispered.</p>
<p>"Then how can I think the wrong thing?" Brooke said gently while moving closer. Sam had bowed her head again and Brooke wanted to look into those expressive brown eyes as she talked to her. Brooke cupped Sam’s chin in her water hot hand and lifted her face up.</p>
<p>"If that’s how you feel, Sam, then I’m not going to get upset or offended," she explained. "I’m flattered actually. And happy that you feel that way." </p>
<p>"Really?" Sam asked surprised. Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"Really. And truthfully, Sam, I think you’re beautiful too," she confessed shyly. Taking the chance while she had it, Brooke ran her thumb over Sam’s lush bottom lip and smiled as the corners of Sam’s mouth quirked up.</p>
<p>"Brooke, I…"</p>
<p>"Shhh, Sam…" Brooke said as she leaned closer. Their lips were almost touching, the air still and calm as they leaned towards each other in anticipation.</p>
<p>KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK</p>
<p>The front door seemed to wobble with the force of the knocking coming from the other side.</p>
<p>"Ignore it," Sam whispered as her eyes locked with Brooke’s. Brooke nodded silently and leaned back in. She wanted so badly to taste Sam’s lips and could tell that Sam was feeling the same way. Her heart was hammering so loudly in her chest she was surprised Sam couldn’t hear it.</p>
<p>KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK</p>
<p>"I know you two are in there! Answer the freaking door!" Nicole’s irate voice cut through the spell surrounding the two like a bucket of cold ice water onto their bodies and they jumped apart.</p>
<p>"Jesus H. Christ," Sam breathed as she tried to will her heartbeat back to normal.</p>
<p>"What the HELL is she doing here?" Brooke fumed. Sam shrugged as the blonde got up, wrapped her robe around her and went to answer the door.</p>
<p>"What the fuck, Nicole?" she said as she ripped open the door to face her former best friend and the rest of the group.</p>
<p>"Surprise," Nicole said smugly as she looked at Brooke. She then saw the lack of attire on the taller girl and frowned. "Where’s Sam?"</p>
<p>"Right here," Sam said as she walked up behind Brooke, tying her robe as she approached. Nicole looked from a dripping wet Brooke to an equally wet Sam and her frown became a hot scowl.</p>
<p>"Isn’t that cute?" she sneered. The rest of the group pushed past the three in the door into the cabin to get out of the cold. They started to inspect the cabin as the three played out their drama in the doorway.</p>
<p>"Why are you here, Nicole?" Brooke asked impatiently. She was so close to getting what she wanted and like always, Nicole had gotten in her way. She was beyond angry.</p>
<p>"I’m surprising my girlfriend," Nicole said, stressing the last word to jab Brooke with it like a barb. She walked over and enveloped Sam in a hug, which Sam returned awkwardly. "Hey," Nicole purred.</p>
<p>"Uh, hi," Sam stammered. She looked over at Brooke, her eyes clearly confused.</p>
<p>"I thought you’d like your birthday present even more if you could share it with me and your friends," Nicole cooed into Sam’s ear explaining herself. Sam forced a smile onto her face. All she really wanted was to get back to the hot tub and Brooke but that wasn’t happening anytime soon. From the crushed and hurt look on Brooke’s face, she doubted it was ever going to happen now anyway.</p>
<p>"Wow, Brooke. This place is really nice," Carmen said as she walked over. Brooke rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"Yeah whatever. Grab your stuff since I assume you’re staying here. Make yourselves comfortable," she sighed before leaving for her room.</p>
<p>"What’s wrong with Brooke?" Harrison asked. Sam watched the upset blonde leave and wanted to go after her but the tight hold Nicole had on her prevented her from doing so.</p>
<p>"Probably upset that we’re going to be here interrupting her beauty sleep," Nicole said snidely. "She’ll recover. Let’s get settled in."</p>
<hr/>
<p>"All I’m saying, Sam, is that it didn’t look that good when we get here and the two of you are all cozy in the hot tub," Nicole argued later in the room she was sharing with Sam. Sam sighed and flopped down on the bed.</p>
<p>"Whatever, Nicole. Nothing was going on. We skied all day and were simply sharing the tub to soak away the chill. Get over it," Sam retorted.</p>
<p>"You’re my girlfriend, not hers," Nicole pointed out.</p>
<p>"God, Nic, move on all ready. Jealous green is not a good color on you," Sam snapped. Nicole frowned and realized that she was doing more harm than good letting her unruly emotions get in her way. If she continued letting them dictate how she handled Sam, she would lose the brunette to Brooke and it’d be her own fault. She switched tactics.</p>
<p>"Aren’t you at all happy to see me, Sammy?" she said slinking over to the bed and crawling over to Sam. She draped herself over Sam. "I’m happy to see you," she said as she nipped at Sam’s neck and ear.</p>
<p>"Nic, please," Sam sighed. "I’m not in the mood." Nic froze.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I said I wasn’t in the mood. Besides, our friends are in the adjoining rooms. I don’t wanna give them an auditory treat, OK?" Nicole rolled off of her and huffed.</p>
<p>"What has gotten into you lately?" she snapped.</p>
<p>"Me? What about you? Showing up here unannounced. And don’t give me that bullshit about surprising me for my birthday. I know when you’re up to something, Satan," Sam pointed out reverting to Nicole’s nickname out of frustration. Nicole turned on her side to ignore Sam.</p>
<p>"I have no idea what you’re talking about. Good night SPAM," she growled. Neither girl said another word to the other as they drifted off to sleep mad.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter Fourteen">
<p>Brooke sat drinking her tea the next morning still fuming mad that Nicole had pulled such a dirty trick. </p>
<p>&amp;lt;This was supposed to be Sammy’s special trip. Something to remember her father by and something special for her and I to share. Damn Nicole for horning in where she wasn’t wanted&amp;gt;</p>
<p>"Morning, Brooke," Sam said as she entered the kitchen. Brooke’s bad mood immediately lifted upon seeing Sam. "Where is everyone?" she asked grabbing some scrambled eggs that were sitting on a nearby plate.</p>
<p>"Well, aside from you and…Nicole," she fairly growled the name. "Everyone else went into town to see the sights and ski," Brooke explained. Sam nodded and poured herself some orange juice.</p>
<p>"What about you?" Brooke shrugged.</p>
<p>"I wanted to see what you were doing," she said.</p>
<p>"Ooo, planning your day around me?" Sam teased. Brooke smiled glad to see that their pattern of teasing wasn’t going to change just because they had company.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Besides, it’ll really piss Nicole off&amp;gt;</p>
<p>"You know me, Sam. Where you go, I follow," she retorted. Sam smirked.</p>
<p>"You just like to watch my ass," Sam upped the ante. Brooke wasn’t intimidated.</p>
<p>"And what an ass it is," she shot back enjoying the way Sam suddenly blushed. "What? You think I never looked? Please."</p>
<p>"You tease," Sam chided.</p>
<p>"You started it," Brooke pointed out still smiling. "So, what are your plans for the day?"</p>
<p>"She is spending the day with me," Nicole informed her haughtily, angry after overhearing the entire exchange beforehand.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;How DARE Brooke talk to Sam like that? I’ll show her who belongs to who&amp;gt; Nicole stewed. Brooke glared at the newcomer to the kitchen as Sam sighed.</p>
<p>"Nicole…" she stared wanting to stop any trouble between the two blondes. Brooke stood up quickly.</p>
<p>"That’s fine, Sam. I think I’ll just hang around here and enjoy the quiet. Have a good day," she stormed off also not wanting to give Nicole the satisfaction. Sam turned and scowled at Nicole.</p>
<p>"Why do you have to push her buttons like that?" she asked angrily. Nicole stared at her blankly.</p>
<p>"Like what? And why do you talk to her the way I just heard you?"</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?" Sam asked confused.</p>
<p>"You were flirting, I heard you!" Nicole accused. Sam rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh I was not. Get over it. You know, I am so not liking this paranoid possessive thing you have going," she said walking towards her room to get changed. "Either chill out or go home because you’re ruining my vacation."</p>
<hr/>
<p>Brooke could hear Sam and Nicole shouting later the next evening as the two girls returned from town. Everyone else was upstairs playing cards as the last two cabin-mates arrived home. Brooke sat in an armchair out of sight as Sam and Nicole entered the house.</p>
<p>"Let it go, damn it Nicole!" Sam nearly screamed. "You do not own me."</p>
<p>"I am your girlfriend and as such I deserve some expectations," Nicole pointed out. Sam whirled around on her.</p>
<p>"What you deserve is a swift kick in the ass for your behavior today!" she yelled. "You have done nothing but bad mouth Brooke and my behavior. How many times do I have to tell you that nothing happened?"</p>
<p>"Until I believe you," Nicole shot back.</p>
<p>"I shouldn’t have to explain ANYTHING to you. You should trust me!" Sam countered.</p>
<p>"Yeah right. Around Miss Perfect? Please Sam, I don’t trust either of you," Nicole growled.</p>
<p>"That’s not fair. So what if I find her attractive?"</p>
<p>"YOU FIND HER ATTRACTIVE?" Nicole screamed. Sam winced, as did Brooke in the next room.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Bad move, Sam&amp;gt; Brooke thought. &amp;lt;That’ll piss her off more&amp;gt; But at the same time, it made Brooke happy to hear.</p>
<p>"Oh for God’s sake…" Sam sighed. "Yes, I think Brooke is beautiful. So? She’s straight, Nic. Try to remember that little fact. I could throw myself at her feet and she’d pat me on the head and say ‘Sorry Sammy. You’re barking up the wrong tree’. So you have nothing to worry about."</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Oh Sammy, if you only understood&amp;gt; Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"I want you to stop spending so much time with her. She’s twisting you away from me…"</p>
<p>"No, Nic, you’re doing that fine on your own," Sam sneered. "And who the Hell are you to tell me who I can and can’t spend time with?"</p>
<p>"Your girlfriend," Nic declared. Sam shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, we agreed when we started out that this was for ‘fun’. Nothing more. No pesky emotions to get in the way and make it more than that. We were just enjoying each other, Nicole. Don’t stand there and decide that because you’ve slept with me that you can run my life," Sam snarled.</p>
<p>"You WILL listen to me, Sam…" Nicole started, used to getting her own way if she was intimidating enough.</p>
<p>"NO! No I won’t! You don’t own me, Nicole. Your name is not tattooed on my ass. No where on me does it say ‘Property of Nicole Julian.’ I am free to do as I chose, thank you. You are not my mother, or my spouse! You do not rule me." </p>
<p>"No but Brookie does," Nic said condescendingly. "She snaps her fingers and you come running."</p>
<p>"Will you get off of that trip? Brooke does not have feelings for me."</p>
<p>"God, Sam, open your eyes!" Nicole ordered. "She is so into you!"</p>
<p>"Get a grip," Sam sighed.</p>
<p>"No, Sam, YOU get a grip."</p>
<p>"You know what? Brooke was right about everything she ever said about you. You are a self-centered little harpy who only cares about getting what she wants and what is best for her. I am SO glad Brooke is nothing like you."</p>
<p>"Oh, so you KNOW she’s ‘nothing like me’, huh? And how would you know that?" Nicole asked sarcastically.</p>
<p>"We’ve grown closer recently," Sam said not backing down from the unspoken challenge. "You have a problem with that? So we flirt, so what? I find her attractive. And you know what else? She thinks I’m attractive too. What do you think of that? Bet you REALLY feel threatened now you insecure little head case," Sam taunted. Nicole felt her face flush with anger.</p>
<p>"She TOLD you that? Unbelievable!" Nicole growled.</p>
<p>"What? It’s unbelievable that someone like Brooke could find me attractive? Gee, thanks Nicole," Sam said sarcastically. Nicole shook her head.</p>
<p>"Sam…" Nicole began. "Damn it I knew Brooke was going to do this."</p>
<p>"Do what?" Sam asked confused but Nicole’s sudden shift from anger to something else, almost hurt.</p>
<p>"I just knew she wouldn’t be able to keep her hands to herself and the SECOND you were offered that you’d jump at it." Sam arched an eyebrow and stared at the short-haired blonde.</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?" she asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Brooke. And you know damn well what I mean, Sam. She’s about as straight as k.d. lang at a Melissa Etheridge concert," she sighed. </p>
<p>"What?" Sam asked disbelieving. Nicole started pacing, totally ignoring Sam’s presence for the time being.</p>
<p>"I thought if I got here in time I could keep her from getting to you. I mean, I knew how she felt but I never thought that that little meek minded, whishy washy push over would have the balls to act on it," she ranted to herself. Sam’s jaw just about hit the floor.</p>
<p>"Are you saying what I think you’re saying?" she asked barely above a whisper. In the next room, Brooke held her breath. Everything came down to the next few minutes and she knew it. She was terrified.</p>
<p>"Brooke’s gay, Sam! And desperately in love with you, you stupid twit!" Nicole threw her hands up in the air as she yelled. "How could you have been so blind?"</p>
<p>"Liar," Sam hissed.</p>
<p>"No, Sam, it’s the sad, God’s honest truth," Nic said defeated. Sam’s eyes narrowed and turned cold.</p>
<p>"And you knew for how long?" Nicole felt her blood run cold as she realized that she just lost Sam due to her own big mouth.</p>
<p>"Before you even came out," Nicole confessed in a whisper knowing that there was no winning now so she might as well be honest. Maybe that way she could at least still do a little wounding to both girls.</p>
<p>"That long and you didn’t tell me?" Sam asked advancing on Nicole dangerously. "You knew all that time and didn’t tell me? And what was all this, huh? What was us? A con? No, I know what it was. A way to hurt Brooke, a way to REALLY put the screws to her. You BITCH!"</p>
<p>"Sam, let me explain…" Nicole tried to interrupt.</p>
<p>"No! If that’s the way you’re going to be, Nicole, you can just go back to LA and consider us through!" Sam stormed out the front door, slamming it behind her.</p>
<p>"Damn it," Nicole swore as she watched Sam leave. She heard someone clapping behind her and turned to face Brooke leaning in the doorway.</p>
<p>"Congratulations, Nic, you blew it," she laughed. Nicole glared at her.</p>
<p>"Fuck you, Princess. Are you happy? You win." Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"It never had to be a contest, Nicole. You’re the one who had to play the game. You betrayed me and my confidence. I don’t know what your smarmy plan is, but it’s not going to work. Especially now that you’ve lost Sam. You’ve no one to blame for this mess but yourself so, well that’s sad. You had everything, and you blew it."</p>
<p>"Screw you," Nicole spat and headed to go pack her things. She wanted to get as far away from the cabin and everyone in it as soon as possible.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter Fifteen">
<p>It was nearly two AM and Brooke was beginning to worry. Sam hadn’t come home yet and the snow was coming down at a good pace. The weather report she’d heard called for near blizzard conditions due to a sudden change in fronts and she was scared that Sam would be caught in it and get lost. Everyone, including a sullen Nicole had gone to bed but Brooke couldn’t sleep and knew she wouldn’t until Sam was safely back in the cabin.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Come on, Sam. This isn’t funny&amp;gt; she thought as she paced by the window with her arms crossed over her chest. She could feel the chill through the plate glass windows as she stared out at the thick snow and shuddered to think about how cold Sam must be out in it.</p>
<p>"Sam still not back?" Lily asked quietly as she came down the stairs. Brooke jumped slightly in surprise and then shook her head.</p>
<p>"I’m getting really worried, Lily," she said her voice full of concern.</p>
<p>"Sam’s a tough girl, I’m sure she’s fine," Lily tried to reassure the fidgety blonde.</p>
<p>"But it’s so cold out there and all she has on is her ski jacket. And it’s snowing so fast. Three inches in the past half-hour. She might be lost and…and…" a few tears slipped down Brooke’s face and Lily enveloped her in a hug.</p>
<p>"Shhh, Brooke, she’ll be fine. Boy, you’re really worried about her aren’t you?" Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah," she sniffled.</p>
<p>"You care about Sam a lot, don’t you?" Lily asked carefully. Brooke eyed her suspiciously. "I overheard the uhm, shouting match from earlier, Brooke. Don’t worry, no one else did."</p>
<p>"Oh God," Brooke sobbed collapsing on the couch. "Lily, what am I going to do? Nicole played us both and now I don’t know what to do."</p>
<p>"Hey, it’s OK. It’ll work out, Brooke. You’ll see. She cares for you too. You’d have to be blind or oblivious…or male not to see it," Lily joked. Brooke stood back up and walked to the window.</p>
<p>"But she’s out there," Brooke said distressed. She ran her hand over the cold glass. "Alone. And it’s so cold." Lily walked up behind her.</p>
<p>"Maybe we should wake the others, grab the lanterns and go look for her? She couldn’t have gotten far," Lily suggested. Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"Get the others," she said firmly. "I’ll call the Ski Patrol on the CB and let them know she’s missing. Then we go looking."</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sam walked blindly as the snow started falling faster and faster. She was cursing herself as the cold and wet seeped into her bones and she shook violently.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Oh, well, you solved a lot, didn't you, Sam? Stormed out as a storm was rolling in. Jesus, and now lost. How pathetic&amp;gt; she sighed. Her breath came out as a frozen cloud and hung in the air in front of her.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;I'll be lucky if someone finds me before the spring thaw&amp;gt;she thought morbidly. She wrapped her arms around her middle and tucked her head down against the wind as she plowed forward the best she could. All she could think about was the warm cabin with the roaring fireplace that she'd foolishly left. And Brooke.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Shit, she's going to be worried. I'm going to end up ruining her vacation. Damn it&amp;gt; She looked around desperately hoping to see something, anything familiar. But everything was covered in a blanket of white and blended together under the grey sky.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;God, I'm cold&amp;gt; she shivered. She tried to fight the panicked tears that were threatening to spill from her eyes, knowing that they'd only freeze before they got anywhere.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;God, I don't want to die like this&amp;gt; she realized. &amp;lt;But if I don't find shelter soon, I just might&amp;gt;</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry, Brooke," she whispered to the cold night air. She then trudged on.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter Sixteen">
<p>"OK, we’re ready Brooke. What did the Ski Patrol say?" Lily asked as the assembled teens finished putting on their boots and readied their lanterns and equipment. Brooke frowned.</p>
<p>"They said that she hasn’t been missing long enough and that they have an entire group of skiers lost on the north face that they’re looking for. They told me to keep calm and that she’ll probably be home any minute but if not, call back in a few hours. I don’t want to wait that long. I know how cold it gets out there and Sam’s not used to it. I want to find her now," Brooke explained.</p>
<p>"What’s the plan?" Josh asked as everyone looked to Brooke for instructions. </p>
<p>"We need to stay in teams so no more of us get lost. Don’t wander too far first of all. Second, Mary Cherry, you stay here in case she comes back to the cabin. Lily and Josh go west, Carmen and Harrison go east, south is straight up so I doubt she went that way, Nic and I will go north," Brooke declared.</p>
<p>"Who died and put you in charge?" Nicole demanded to know.</p>
<p>"Either shut the Hell up and cooperate or stay the hell out of my way," Brooke snapped. "I haven’t got time to play your childish games. Sam is lost out there and scared. I can feel it. We need to find her as soon as possible. So get in line and do as you’re told or go back to bed because I don’t need you." Nicole was silent after the tirade.</p>
<p>"OK, everyone ready? Let’s go," Brooke ordered.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sam stumbled and tripped, falling to her knees as she tried to maneuver her way through the increasingly thick snow. She was shaking and tired and doubted she’d ever feel warm again. She glanced down at her watch, thankful that it seemed to still be working and figured that she’d been out there for close to six hours. She was cold, tired, hungry and wet.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Where the Hell am I?&amp;gt; she wondered as she looked around. But all the trees looked the same and she was no closer to finding her way back to the cabin than she was an hour ago.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Shit, shit, shit on me and my stupid pride. What kind of fool takes off angry in unfamiliar territory? Oh yeah, me&amp;gt; she scolded herself. She wearily got to her feet again, unsure exactly how steady she was since she’d long ago lost feeling in her feet and started forward once more. She tried to keep track of where she was going but the snow seemed to cover her tracks as fast as she made them and she was almost sure that once or twice she’d traveled in a complete circle. The wind howled around her, biting at her nose and ears and making her burrow down further into her parka.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;This is not happening&amp;gt; she told herself. She kept hoping that she was having a really bad nightmare but the cold wetness that had seeped into every inch of clothing and frozen it nearly to her let her know otherwise. That hot tub was looking even better with every exhausted step she took. Her teeth chattered almost painfully as the shivers rocketed though her slight frame. She stumbled again but managed to catch herself against a tree with a mumbled swear as she tried to rub her gloved hands together. But she couldn’t seem to get her arms and hands to cooperate fully. She was starting to get really scared.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;I wish I knew more about hypothermia and stuff. At least then I’d know how much danger I was in&amp;gt; She stumbled a few more feet before her shivering turned violent and she leaned up against a tree for support.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;God, I’m cold&amp;gt; Sam thought sadly. &amp;lt;And I know the shivering is getting worse. I need to find shelter&amp;gt; She blinked fuzzily and looked out into the falling snow.</p>
<p>"Please God," she prayed. "Let me find my way."</p>
<hr/>
<p>An hour later, there was still no sign of Sam and Brooke was nearly sick with worry. She and Nicole barely spoke to each other as they trudged through the snow near the cabin looking for any sign of the wayward brunette.</p>
<p>"I’m sorry," Nicole whispered finally breaking the stony silence.</p>
<p>"For?"</p>
<p>"If anything happens, it’s my fault," Nicole pointed out guiltily. Brooke stopped walking and stared at her.</p>
<p>"You’re right, it is," she snapped. "You’d better pray to God we find her all right. Or I will MAKE you pay."</p>
<p>"You really do love her, don’t you?" Nicole asked quietly.</p>
<p>"Yes. And despite yourself, you care for her too or you wouldn’t be out here," Brooke retorted.</p>
<p>"Yes," Nicole admitted while hanging her head. She was also worried sick that something bad had happened to Sam.</p>
<p>"So tell me, how does it feel to get caught in your own trap?" Brooke asked angrily. Nicole shook her head but said nothing. She walked on looking for Sam.</p>
<hr/>
<p>&amp;lt;Ya know what? This ain’t MY fault. Thisss isss all Nic’sss fault&amp;gt; Sam decided two hours later, her thought processes being effected by the prolonged cold. She let out an absurd giggle.</p>
<p>"Swerv her write," she frowned. Her mouth and lips felt frozen. "SERVE," she enunciated to no one in particular. "Serve her RIGHT." She giggled again and removed her hat. She was starting to sweat badly.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;It’s snowin’ an’ I’m sweating. Go fig&amp;gt; she thought with a quiet laugh. &amp;lt;Well, at least ’m not shiverin’ s’ much. Tha’ was annoyin’. Wonder where I am. Wonder if anyone’s lookin’ fer me? Eh, who cares? Nobody else does. Not even Brooke&amp;gt; Sam sighed at the thought of her blonde friend. </p>
<p>&amp;lt;I should have told her th’ truth. I love her and she shoulda known. I…&amp;gt; The rest of her thought was cut off as she tripped over a branch hidden under the snow and struck her head. She peacefully surrendered to the blackness pulling at her.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter Seventeen">
<p>Brooke was almost back to the cabin, distressed at the fact that it had been so long and they hadn’t found Sam when she heard Josh shout.</p>
<p>"Holy shit! Brooke! I found her!" She ran to where Josh was yelling from, barely a hundred feet from the grounds and found Josh brushing off Sam’s curled up form lying on the ground.</p>
<p>"Oh God," she gasped as she and Lily bent over the frighteningly still form.</p>
<p>"She was almost home," Nicole whispered to no one.</p>
<p>"Her pulse is weak, Brooke, but she’s alive," Lily assured the lanky cheerleader.</p>
<p>"Josh, can you carry her back?" Brooke asked. Josh nodded and gingerly picked up the precious cargo. Carmen and Harrison, drawn by the commotion, ran ahead to get blankets and things ready.</p>
<p>"Take her upstairs to my room, the bed is the biggest," Brooke instructed when they reached the house. Josh complied wordlessly. "Carmen, Lily, I need warm blankets and water…Mary Cherry, help them get some hot liquids with lots of calories, sugar, carbs, proteins that sorta thing. But no caffeine, OK? Harrison, see if you can get a hold of the Ski Patrol and tell them we have a hypothermic teen that needs medical attention ASAP," Brooke took total control drawing on her limited knowledge from her visits to Colorado as a child.</p>
<p>"What can I do to help?" Nicole asked. Brooke turned on her with a murderous glint in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Stay as far away from Sam as possible," she growled before heading up the stairs behind Josh.</p>
<p>Josh set Sam gently down on the bed as Brooke entered the room.</p>
<p>"Grab some of her dry clothes so I can change her into them. Warm stuff, Josh. Hurry," Brooke asked. Josh ran off to Sam’s room while Brooke looked the prone figure over. She took in the pale skin, purplish lips, the deep cut to her forehead all with a clinical eye, knowing if she let her emotions get in the way that Sam might suffer.</p>
<p>"Here Brooke," Josh said entering the room carrying several sets of sweats, socks, a few towels, and other assorted things for Sam. Brooke said thanks and started to strip Sam’s soaking wet clothes from her.</p>
<p>"I need the first aid kit from the bathroom too, Josh. OK?"</p>
<p>"You got it," and he was off again to retrieve it.</p>
<p>"OK, Sammy, let’s get you dry," Brooke spoke softly to the unconscious girl. She took off Sam’s jacket and then carefully removed Sam’s boots and socks, worried at how red and angry her feet looked. She redressed them in several pairs of warm thick socks and then started on Sam’s top. </p>
<p>"Please don’t end up mad at me for this, Sam," she whispered. "It’s for your own good." Despite the fact that Brooke knew this to be true, she couldn’t help but feel slightly guilty at seeing Sam so vulnerable. She stripped Sam completely down bit by bit, changing her into dry clothes as she went. As she finished with Sam’s pants and her new dry sweats were on, Josh returned with the first aid kit and Lily with warm blankets and hot juice in tow.</p>
<p>"I read somewhere that diluted jell-o was good for hypothermia victims, Brooke," Lily explained handing over the cup. "So we started with that."</p>
<p>"Thanks," Brooke said as she cleaned and dressed the nasty gash on Sam’s forehead. "She banged her head," she said absently.</p>
<p>"Harrison said he can’t get through on the CB. He, Carmen and Mary Cherry are hiking down to the nearest Station for help," Josh spoke up. Brooke nodded.</p>
<p>"Storms messing with reception probably," she said. "Help me wrap her in the blankets." They placed the warm blankets on Sam’s core points, her neck, underarms and groin to encourage re-warming and avoid after-drop. Because Brooke’s knowledge was sketchy at best, she was taking all the precautions she could. They then wrapped Sam up in the covers from the bed cocoon-like and Brooke climbed into bed with her to provide simple body heat.</p>
<p>"I don’t want to leave her alone," she said softly. "Let me know when the Rescue Squad gets here," she said. Lily and Josh nodded and left the room.</p>
<p>"Hang on, Sammy," Brooke whispered into Sam’s cold ear as the other girl still shivered. "I’m right here. You’re going to be OK. I promise I’ll take care of you."</p>
<p>"Come back to me, Sammy. I love you."</p>
<hr/>
<p>Sam’s shivering continued on and off for another few hours as Brooke lay holding the injured girl. She had almost slipped into a semi-doze herself when Brooke heard a low pain-filled moan come from the form wrapped securely in her arms. She lifted her head and looked down at Sam’s now flushed cheeks.</p>
<p>"Sammy?" she whispered. Sam huddled down into her blanket cocoon and shivered.</p>
<p>"Hel…lp…c…colllld…" she gasped incoherent. She moaned again, still in pain and obviously scared. Brooke tightened her hold.</p>
<p>"Shhh, Sammy, you’re safe now. I’ve got you," she whispered almost in tears. She hated hearing such pain coming from Sam but not be able to help. She also knew that Sam wasn’t really conscious just yet and somewhere in her frozen haze thought she was still lost outdoors in the storm. </p>
<p>"Would it help if I talked to you, Sammy?" Brooke asked quietly. "Would you know that you were safe then?" she wondered out loud as soft frightened cries and sobs seemed to continuously tumble from Sam’s mouth. She felt Sam relax somewhat at hearing her voice and she reached over to brush some still damp hair away from Sam’s cheek.</p>
<p>"I’ll talk so that you know you’re not alone and you’re right here with me, Sammy," Brooke told her lovingly. "You’re safe back in the cabin. Josh found you, you were almost back to the front door. But you must have fallen and hit your head before you got there. I hope you’re OK." There was a dark bruise forming around the gash on Sam’s forehead where she’d struck it that was worrying Brooke somewhat.</p>
<p>"So, I changed you out of your wet clothes and put you into dry ones," Brooke blushed. "I hope you don’t mind. I had to strip you completely down but I swear my intentions were honorable. But…you do have a beautiful body, Sam," she confessed shyly. "I know, not appropriate but, I wanted to tell you now because I know I’d never have the guts to tell you when you were conscious and alert." Brooke nuzzled the nape of Sam’s neck, trying to will some of her energy and body heat into the silent brunette.</p>
<p>"Actually there are a lot of things I want to say to you that I never had the strength to say. That’s why Nicole did what she did. I’m not saying that she only dated you to get at me but…God Sam, it’s a long story," Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"Then again, I guess you’re not going anywhere," she pointed out. A miserable whimper escaped Sam’s lips and turned into a low keening wail.</p>
<p>"What’s wrong, Sammy?" Brooke asked alarmed. She moved so that she was looking down at Sam’s slack face. Sam frowned in her unconscious state and started to mumble.</p>
<p>"Sssor…rrrry Bbbbroooke," she muttered through still chattering teeth. Brooke sighed again but was heartened by the fact that Sam’s shivering seemed to be lessening and her skin was warmer.</p>
<p>"You have nothing to be sorry for, Sam," Brooke assured the other girl, laying down next to her again and turning Sam so that Sam’s head was on her shoulder.</p>
<p>"Let me tell you a few things while I have your undivided attention," Brooke said with a sad smirk. "I’ve had feelings for you for a long time. Deep feelings for you. Even before you came out to everyone about your own sexuality I knew about my own. And when you came out, I thought, ‘God, here’s my chance. Maybe, just maybe Sam will give me a chance to prove to her how much I care’. But I got scared. I couldn’t seem to find the right time, the right words. And then, it was too late. Nicole, Nicole who KNEW how I felt, who HAD known for a while how I felt about you USED it against me and went after you herself. And while I knew I still could have told you how I felt, especially given the fact that your relationship with Nicole wasn’t really what you and I would call a ‘relationship’, I was still scared," Brooke confessed softly.</p>
<p>"So I hid behind the excuse of not wanting to pull you in two directions. I wanted to see you happy and I thought that you were. As much as I loved you, I was still too scared of you not loving me back. I couldn’t handle that, Sam. I still can’t. But I need to tell you this now, I have to get it off my chest. I’ve come too close to losing you and it frightened me. Even if you don’t remember a word I’ve said, I’LL know that I’ve said it and that’s enough." Brooke took a deep cleansing breath.</p>
<p>"I love you Samantha McPherson. With all my heart and soul," she admitted to the still form in her arms. Sam burrowed further into her chest and sighed contentedly, her shaking finally stopping. Brooke took that as a good sign and kissed the top of Sam’s head.</p>
<p>"Why don’t we both get some rest, huh, Sammy?"</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter Eighteen">
<p>&amp;lt;I’m warm and I’m cold…that can’t be right&amp;gt; Sam’s thoughts were fuzzy and disjointed as she floated towards consciousness. There was something pulling at her, calling her further out. It was only a vague rumbling sound at first but as she focused on it, she was eventually able to make out Brooke’s soothing voice talking to her, comforting her.</p>
<p>"…before you came out to everyone about your own sexuality I knew about my own," she heard Brooke say.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;Huh? What?&amp;gt; Sam’s foggy mind desperately tried to catch up.</p>
<p>"And when you came out, I thought, ‘God, here’s my chance. Maybe, just maybe Sam will give me a chance to prove to her how much I care’. But I got scared. I couldn’t seem to find the right time, the right words. And then, it was too late," Brooke went on as a still semi-conscious Sam listened.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;God, Nic was right!&amp;gt;</p>
<p>"Nicole, Nicole who KNEW how I felt, who HAD known for a while how I felt about you USED it against me and went after you herself. And while I knew I still could have told you how I felt, especially given the fact that your relationship with Nicole wasn’t really what you and I would call a ‘relationship’, I was still scared," Brooke confessed softly.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;*snort* You and me both, Brooke. I wanted you and settled for Satan. Looks like we both got burned. Damn that peroxide bitch&amp;gt; Sam thought angrily. She tried to surface further, she wanted to be able to actually talk back to Brooke, share her own feelings, but she lacked the energy to do so. So she sat back and listened as Brooke continued.</p>
<p>"So I hid behind the excuse of not wanting to pull you in two directions. I wanted to see you happy and I thought that you were. As much as I loved you, I was still too scared of you not loving me back. I couldn’t handle that, Sam. I still can’t," Brooke went on.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;You don’t need to worry, Brooke&amp;gt; Sam thought desperately. &amp;lt;I DO love you&amp;gt; She wanted to shout but her body wouldn’t respond to her. She heard Brooke’s voice continuing.</p>
<p>"But I need to tell you this now, I have to get it off my chest. I’ve come too close to losing you and it frightened me. Even if you don’t remember a word I’ve said, I’LL know that I’ve said it and that’s enough." Sam heard Brooke take a deep cleansing breath and took one of her own.</p>
<p>"I love you Samantha McPherson. With all my heart and soul," Brooke said with such conviction that Sam had no doubt that it was the truth. And it warmed the last frozen edges of her body to hear those words from Brooke. Using the last of her dwindling strength, Sam moved herself as close to Brooke as she could get and let out the breath she was holding, hoping to let Brooke know that she heard her and felt the same way before unconsciousness stole her away once more.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Brooke woke a while later to find Sam shaking again, this time from a fever. She called for Lily who came into the room.</p>
<p>"Have you heard anything from the Rescue Squad or Carmen and the others?" Brooke asked as Sam tossed fitfully in her arms. Lily shook her head sadly.</p>
<p>"No, and the storm has gotten worse, Brooke," Lily explained. "How is she?" she asked looking over at Sam.</p>
<p>"I think we’ve got her re-warmed but now she’s developed a fever. I think being out in the cold and wet, she’s getting sick," Brooke said as she shifted on the bed for a better hold on Sam.</p>
<p>"Br’ke," Sam mumbled as the blonde moved.</p>
<p>"Shhh, Sam, I’m right here," Brooke whispered to her.</p>
<p>"Don’ leave me," Sam begged as she latched onto Brooke as tightly as she could in her weakened state. Tears pricked at Brooke’s eyes at the desperateness in Sam’s voice. She kissed Sam’s hot forehead and sighed.</p>
<p>"I promise you that I’m not, Sammy," she said. "Lily, can you get me some more clean clothes for her and a cold compress?" Lily nodded. </p>
<p>"Sure thing, Brooke. Be right back," the Latina said before leaving to do as she was asked. She knew Sam was in good hands with Brooke and would do whatever she had to to help Brooke see Sam through.</p>
<p>"Hang in there, Sammy. You’re doing great," Brooke encouraged.</p>
<p>"How is she?" Nicole asked quietly from the doorway. Brooke turned her attention from the sick girl to the blonde in the door and glared.</p>
<p>"She’s sick now, no thanks to you," she snarled. "Hypothermia didn’t get her but pneumonia still might if we don’t get her to the hospital soon."</p>
<p>"God, I am so sorry. I never meant for all this to happen, Brooke. You have to believe me," Nicole begged. Brooke shook her head.</p>
<p>"The only thing I have to believe is that Sam is going to be all right. Beyond that is anyone’s guess. Now please leave," she said curtly. Nicole wiped away an errant tear and nodded. She left just as Lily returned.</p>
<p>"Here are some more clothes," she said as she set them down on the bed and handed Brooke a cool compress, which she pressed gently against Sam’s fevered brow. "Brooke, don’t vilify the poor girl. She really is remorseful. She feels terrible enough as it is. I think she really does care for Sam in her own way." Brooke ran her hand through her hair and sighed.</p>
<p>"I know. But I also know that if she hadn’t played this stupid game to begin with, Sam wouldn’t be sick and hurt right now. This is essentially her fault. And I need to blame someone so that I don’t feel so damn guilty."</p>
<p>"I understand," Lily said. "I’ll leave so you can change Sam. Call if you need anything."</p>
<p>"I will," Brooke turned back to Sam as Lily left. "Let’s get you into clean clothes again Sammy." Her only response was a mumbled groan that she didn’t understand completely. But at least Sam seemed to be responding to her. She got Sam changed again and huddled under the covers as the shakes from the fever overtook the slim brunette and she started to whimper. Brooke started to sing softly to Sam as she lay down beside her and it seemed to calm Sam somewhat.</p>
<p>"I’m sorry your vacation turned out so badly, Sam," she said softly, placing a gently kiss to Sam’s sweat dampened temple. "I wanted it to be so special for you. I know that your dad was very special to you and I wanted this memory of him, of his promise to be special too. I’m very sorry." She faded off to an exhausted sleep shortly afterward, draped carefully over Sam, keeping her safe.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter title="Chapter Nineteen">
<p>Much to Brooke’s relief, the Rescue Squad arrived a few hours later. Carmen and the others had reached them and practically dragged them back by the hair. They immediately wrapped Sam up on a stretcher and whisked her away to the nearest medical center with Brooke in tow.</p>
<p>Sam was in and out of consciousness the entire time, calling out for Brooke in her confusion. Nicole had quietly faded to the background when she heard Sam call for Brooke in her delirious state. There was no denying where Sam’s heart truly lay now that she called out for the taller blonde in her time of need. Nicole and Mary Cherry headed to the airport to board a private flight home without a good-bye to anyone although Mary Cherry did let Lily know that they were leaving.</p>
<p>"Nic, are y’all ser this is what ya wanna do?" Mary Cherry asked her silent companion in the taxi back to the airport. She heard Nicole sigh as the other girl stared blankly out the window.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I’m certainly not wanted here. You’re welcome to stay Mary Cherry, I don’t care," she said flatly trying to keep control of her turbulent emotions.</p>
<p>"Ah’d just assume go home wit’ y’all now, Nic," Mary Cherry said. "So, what’s yer plan when we git home?" Nicole tore her gaze from the window and focused on the Southern belle.</p>
<p>"What?" she asked confused. Mary Cherry’s eyes had a somewhat maniacal gleam.</p>
<p>"What are ya plannin’ ta do ta Spam and Brookie when they git home? What nefarious plot are y’all hatchin’?" Nicole ground her teeth together and clenched her eyes shut.</p>
<p>"Just forget about it, Mary Cherry. I’m not going to do anything," she declared.</p>
<p>"WHAT?" Mary Cherry screeched surprised.</p>
<p>"There will be no revenge, I will wreak no vengeance on the unsuspecting. It’s not worth it. Besides, Sam could be really sick. I think that’s punishment enough." Mary Cherry was quiet for several minutes as she thought this over.</p>
<p>"You actually fell for her didn’t you?" she finally asked Nicole quietly. Again Nicole sighed and this time the tears she had been trying so hard to fight won out and slipped down her cheeks.</p>
<p>"Yes, I did. Damn me to Hell, I did."</p>
<hr/>
<p>At the hospital, they discovered that Sam was slightly dehydrated and had minor frostbite on her ears, nose, fingers, and toes although Brooke’s limited knowledge had been enough to prevent permanent damage. She also had a concussion from when she hit her head, which contributed to her unconsciousness and confusion during her brief periods of awareness. What concerned the doctors now that she was out of danger from hypothermia, was the congestion in her lungs and the fever that raged within her.</p>
<p>Jane and Mike were on their way from California and expected to arrive in the morning after being informed by Lily and Josh of everything that had happened. They were upset but proud of the way Brooke had handled everything. Now Brooke sat exhausted by Sam’s bedside holding the girl’s sweaty hand. She was mindful of the wires monitoring Sam’s condition and the nasal tubes helping Sam get oxygen.</p>
<p>"Time to wake up, Sam. You’re sleeping through your vacation," she teased weakly. Her own voice was nothing but a raspy whisper; she was so beyond her own limits of endurance. She only wanted Sam to wake up and smile at her; she’d give anything to see that simple thing. A harsh, racking cough ripped through Sam making Brooke wince in sympathy.</p>
<p>"God, Sammy, that sounds terrible," she sighed.</p>
<p>"Feels awful too," Sam gasped softly. Brooke smiled and sat up to look at Sam’s glassy but open and aware brown eyes.</p>
<p>"Hello, sleepy-head," she greeted Sam who smiled weakly back. "Welcome back."</p>
<p>"Hey," Sam said in return. Brooke reached out to stroke Sam’s forehead and get her bangs out of her eyes. Sam sighed and closed her eyes at the contact, a gesture not lost on Brooke.</p>
<p>"How you feeling?" Brooke asked. Sam opened her eyes again and tried to focus on Brooke but her vision was slightly blurry. So she looked at the blonde blur in front of her and let Brooke’s welcome and adored voice wash over her and comfort her.</p>
<p>"I’m not cold," she said with a half-hearted smirk. She laughed a little but it quickly turned into a hard coughing fit that left her breathless.</p>
<p>"Are you all right?" Brooke asked worriedly. Sam nodded.</p>
<p>"Yeah," she rasped past the pain in her throat and lungs. "Tired though," she yawned. "And I ruined your vacation." Brooke frowned.</p>
<p>"No you didn’t, Sam," Brooke argued. "I had a good time because you made it enjoyable. This mess is Nicole’s fault. I’m just glad you’re all right. Besides, it was supposed to be YOUR vacation." Sam smiled and yawned again. The pull of sleep was beginning to be too much for her to fight much longer. </p>
<p>"I’m glad you were having fun," she said, her voice fading near the end as her eyes dropped. Brooke grinned and caressed Sam’s cheek with her fingertips.</p>
<p>"I was. And there’s no one else I’d rather have spent the time with," she confessed. "Rest, Sam, and get better. We’ll try the vacation thing again, this time without Nicole and her surprises, I promise." Sam nodded and seemed to drift off. Brooke laid her head down on the bed and started to drift off herself when she heard Sam’s voice again, so soft she almost missed it.</p>
<p>"I heard you," Sam whispered. "And I love you too." Brooke smiled and fell asleep blissfully happy.</p>
<hr/>
<p>"She has pneumonia," Doctor Libby explained to Mike and Jane upon their arrival at the hospital. "It’s not unusual in cases like this and she seems to be fighting it pretty well. We’ve started her on a protocol of antibiotics and she’s holding her own. Now we just have to wait." She pushed open the door to Sam’s room to find both Sam and Brooke asleep on the bed, curled up together like a pair of kittens.</p>
<p>"She hasn’t left her side since they arrived here yesterday," the tall blonde doctor said with a small smile. She looked at the two teens and then back at their parents. "From what the Ski Patrol tells me, you have Brooke to thank for helping save Sam’s life. She re-warmed Sam and kept her hydrated. She did everything right."</p>
<p>"As for Sam’s other injuries, the concussion is healing nicely, as is the frostbite. Providing she doesn’t get any worse with the pneumonia, she should be able to go home in maybe a week," Dr. Libby reassured the worried parents. "She’s a very lucky young lady. That was one heck of a sudden storm."</p>
<p>"So we heard from their friends," Jane said quietly trying not to disturb the sleeping duo.</p>
<p>"Let’s let them sleep," Mike suggested. "They’ve been through a lot."</p>

<chapter title="Chapter Twenty">
<p>They returned home two weeks later when Sam, although still sick, was well enough to travel. She still felt bad that she had ‘ruined’ Brooke’s trip despite the blonde cheerleader’s assurances that she had had a terrific time up until the storm and everything that followed. Brooke also promised that once Sam was well and they had the time, they would give it another go. Sam was looking forward to it.</p>
<p>A few days after returning home, Sam reluctantly dialed Nicole’s number and waited for her ‘girlfriend’ to pick up.</p>
<p>"You’re wasting my time, talk," Nicole barked into the phone.</p>
<p>"Nic, it’s Sam," Sam said, her voice still fading in and out slightly as she spoke.</p>
<p>"Oh…" there was silence on the other end of the phone for a few moments. "How are you feeling?"</p>
<p>"Not bad I guess," Sam shrugged although Nicole couldn’t see her. "Chest hurts from coughing and I still have a slight headache but I’m managing."</p>
<p>"I’m glad. Look, Sam, I really am sorry," Nicole started to apologize.</p>
<p>"I know," Sam cut her off. "Look, I didn’t call to force an apology out of you. I called to make sure we were clear. You and I are over, as in the past, over and done, has been. You know that right?" A heavy sigh was her only response for a minute.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I figured as much. You’re going with the Princess now, I take it?" Nicole said unable to keep the sneer from her voice.</p>
<p>"Brooke and I haven’t even begun to discuss anything. And FYI, it’s none of your business," Sam retorted. She was about to say more when a coughing fit cut her off and she took a few seconds to catch her breath.</p>
<p>"Ow. Anyway, I’m only calling you Nicole to make sure you knew that we’re over. And to make sure you know two more things. One, I don’t blame you for what happened. I shouldn’t have gone storming off in a place I wasn’t familiar with especially when I was angry. I tend to let my anger get the better of me sometimes. But that’s beside the point. The other thing you need to know? Stay the Hell away from me and Brooke," Sam snarled, her formerly friendly voice suddenly cold.</p>
<p>"You knew how she felt and used it against her. That’s inexcusable," she declared. "You truly are a heartless wench, you know that?"</p>
<p>"Sam…" Nicole started as tears began to run down her face.</p>
<p>"Save it. There are no excuses for what you did, Nicole. She was your best friend. She confided in you and you betrayed her. That’s the worst thing you could have done. And whatever little plan you were trying to get away with? It won’t work. Whether or not Brooke and I become an item, we’re still more than enough to handle you. Good-bye." She slammed down the phone and wiped away her own tears.</p>
<p>"That couldn’t have been easy," Brooke said quietly from the doorway. Sam turned to face her. </p>
<p>"It wasn’t. I did kinda like her. In a perverse sort of way now that I think about it," Sam mock shuddered. Brooke walked slowly into the room, eyeing Sam carefully.</p>
<p>"Soooooo," she drawled. "What about us?" Sam arched an eyebrow at her and reclined on her bed.</p>
<p>"What about us?" she parroted. Brooke sighed.</p>
<p>"Please don’t play obstinate, Sam. You know what I mean." Sam bowed her head.</p>
<p>"Did you mean it?" she asked, her voice hushed and vulnerable. "When you said that you loved me, did you mean it? Or did you just say it to bring me back?" Brooke realized that Sam’s reluctance to talk stemmed from her doubt over what was said. She closed the space between them in three quick steps and reached down to tilt Sam’s face up to meet her own.</p>
<p>"I meant it, Sam. With every fiber of my being, God, I meant it," she said firmly watching as unshed tears welled up in Sam’s eyes but stubbornly refused to spill over.</p>
<p>"Why didn’t you tell me? Why did I almost have to die for you to find the ability to say it?" Sam wept as the tears won out and streaked down her face. They were mirrored on Brooke’s face as she wiped Sam’s away with her thumbs.</p>
<p>"I’m so so sorry, Sammy. I should have said something but I let my fear get in my way. And then Nicole got in my way and I really DIDN’T want to make you chose," she started to explain.</p>
<p>"What’s to chose? I love YOU! I have always loved YOU!" Sam declared. Brooke dropped to her knees in front of Sam.</p>
<p>"I would have chosen you," Sam finished in a whisper.</p>
<p>"Oh Sammy," Brooke sighed through her tears. "Thank you." Sam sniffled.</p>
<p>"Thank you for saving my life, Brooke," she said gently. Brooke looked up, locking her hazel eyes with Sam’s watery brown ones.</p>
<p>"Sam, I…" Sam placed her fingers over Brooke’s lips to stop her from speaking.</p>
<p>"Shhh, Brooke. I know, and I love you too," she said with a bright smile. She cupped the sides of Brooke’s face with her palms and drew their faces together. Their first kiss was gentle and tentative, full of love and promise. It lit them both from within and made all the pain worth it.</p>
<p>"God, Sammy," Brooke breathed leaning her forehead against Sam’s as tears of happiness fell down both their cheeks. "You make me so happy."</p>
<p>"So do you," Sam answered. "And I have to confess, in all, Brooke, this was the best vacation I’ve ever had. Thank you." Brooke wrapped her arms around Sam’s waist and rested her head on Sam’s chest, listening to the reassuring heartbeat beneath her ear. She couldn’t remember ever being happier than she was in that one moment. She had Sam and she had Sam’s love. Her life was complete.</p>
<p>"You are more than welcome, Sammy. I love you," she said, just to make sure Sam knew. Sam tightened her own hold on the slender blonde.</p>
<p>"I love you too," she whispered as she scooted up on the bed taking Brooke with her. They fell asleep like that, wrapped completely around each other, contented for the first time in a long time. They both had what they wanted and there was nothing more in the way of their happiness.</p>
