<!-- Telling Series \ Section 4: Carmen - Oops You Did It Again -->

<p>"Josh, man, can I talk to you?" Sugar Daddy asked Josh as he
passed him in the hall. Josh looked at his friend who was an alarming shade of
pale. </p>
<p>"Sure, man, what's up?" Sugar looked up and down the hall and
once he was sure they were alone, leaned in closer to Josh. </p>
<p>"I was walking down the hall and I passed the girls bathroom,
yo, and I heard some yelling. It sounded like Sam and Brooke so I stopped to
listen, just ta make sure they weren't killing each other, you know?" Sugar went
on. </p>
<p>(Uh-oh) Josh moaned to himself. He didn't like where this was
going. </p>
<p>"Anyway," Sugar continued, getting a little more agitated.
"Then I heard Carmen's voice and yo, they were really all going at it and I
heard some stuff that can't possibly be true." Josh rolled his eyes. </p>
<p>(Why me?) </p>
<p>"What did you hear, Shug?" Josh asked patiently. </p>
<p>"Yo, I don't know how you're going to take this seeing as how
Brooke's you're ex and all but Brooke and Sam are like illicit lovers, yo. As in
secret paramours." Josh sighed. </p>
<p>"I thought we agreed that you'd stop reading those romance
novels, Shug," Sugar blushed. </p>
<p>"I only read them for the pick up lines, man. You're missing
the point here, Josh. Brooke and Sam are together! As in to-get-her." Josh
sighed again. </p>
<p>"Are they still in the Novac?" Sugar shrugged. </p>
<p>"Sam and Brooke are, I think. Carmen just left. Why?"
</p>
<p>"Wait here," Josh went to the Novac, knocked and went in. He
emerged a few minutes later with Sam and Brooke. Sugar's male teenage mind noted
how their hair was mussed and they didn't seem at all happy to see him.
</p>
<p>"Sam, Brooke, do you have something to tell Sugar?" Both girls
rolled their eyes and sighed. </p>
<p>"We're involved with each other," they said in unison. They
watched as Sugar's eyes got impossibly wide. </p>
<p>"It's true, yo?" They nodded. "And you knew, Josh?"
</p>
<p>"They told Lily and me a few nights ago," Josh explained. </p>
<p>"And you're OK with that?" Sugar asked, still looking at the
two girls in wonder. Josh nodded. </p>
<p>"As long as they're happy, what business is it of mine?" Sugar
considered this seriously. </p>
<p>"Are you two happy?" Both girls smiled widely. </p>
<p>"Very," Sam answered as she put her arm around Brooke.
</p>
<p>"Absolutely," Brooke responded, wrapping her arm around Sam.
Sugar smiled at them. </p>
<p>"Cool with me then. Who wants to go get a pizza?" </p>
