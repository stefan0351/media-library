<!-- New Path, Old Faces \ Obeying The Dress Code -->

<p>"She actually said yes?" Nicole asked dumbfounded. She
couldn't believe Sam had actually agreed to go to the prom, again. (She's either
really brave or really stupid) Nic mused. Not that she had any plans to run the
poor girl down again, it was just surprising. Brooke nodded as she fixed her
makeup in the mirror of the Novak. </p>
<p>"Yup, it took some convincing but she's gonna go," she chirped
happily. Nic grinned evilly. </p>
<p>"What'd you have to promise her to get her to go?" she asked
wickedly. Brooke glared at her suspiciously but with a small smile. </p>
<p>"Just me," Brooke answered as her smile grew wider. Nicole
rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Spam is so whipped," she sighed with an answering smile.
Brooke shook her finger at her. </p>
<p>"She is not and she is not Spam," she told her friend. Nic
shrugged. </p>
<p>"Whatever," Nic answered. "So, what are you going to wear? And
is Sam going to wear a tux?" Brooke looked at her horrified. </p>
<p>"God, don't say that to her, you'll give her ideas. We're both
wearing dresses if I have beat her over the head with a stick." Nic laughed. </p>
<p>"Can I watch?" </p>
<p>"Oh, knock it off, Nicole. You don't hate her, we both know
it," Brooke huffed. </p>
<p>"OK, so I don't hate her. But I don't have to lead the
`Pro-Sam McPherson' parade either," Nicole countered. Brooke nodded. </p>
<p>"This is true," she agreed as she headed to the door. "Anyway,
I have to go meet her and talk to her about dress shopping anyway. See you
later." </p>

<p>"No, no, no, no, no," Sam protested vehemently. Brooke threw
her hands up in the air in frustration. </p>
<p>"Saaaaam," she complained. </p>
<p>"No," she repeated firmly. </p>
<p>"A dress, Sam. A simple dress. That's all I'm asking." Sam
shook her head. </p>
<p>What part of `no' don't you understand?" Sam asked snottily
from her seat at the table in the coffee shop. Brooke glared at her from her
seat across the table. </p>
<p>"The `n' and the `o'," she answered in the same tone. They
were warming up for what could be a good fight and Brooke didn't want that. She
took a deep breath to calm herself. </p>
<p>"Sam," she started again in a more normal voice. "You're a
girl and you're not wearing a tuxedo." Sam rolled her eyes and let out a deep
sigh. </p>
<p>"I'm acutely aware of the fact that I'm female, Brooke," she
said also calmer. She didn't want to have a huge fight in public either. "And I
never said I was going to wear a tuxedo either. There are other options."
</p>
<p>"Like what?" </p>
<p>"Like a tasteful pants set that matches whatever dress you
decide to wear, I don't know but not a dress, love. I'm just not comfortable in
them," Sam explained. </p>
<p>"But you look so nice in them," Brooke argued with a slight
pout. "With those sexy legs and that body." Sam smiled. </p>
<p>"Ah ah ah, flattery won't work this time," Sam scolded
lightly. "Not even the sexy pout or plying me with great, mind-blowing sex is
going to change my mind." Brooke frowned at that comment. </p>
<p>"Damn," Brooke swore. Sam laughed. </p>
<p>"It's like this, Princess: I'll go to the Prom with you
because you want me to. I'll do that much because I love you and it means so
much to you. In return, all I ask is that you let me wear what I want." Faced
with that argument, Brooke had no choice but to nod her agreement. </p>
<p>"OK," she said reluctantly. "But no tuxes, OK Sammy?" Sam
nodded. She really had no interest in wearing a tuxedo anyway, as much as she
liked the ones with tails and top hats and the little canes. She had had enough
of canes to last a lifetime and figured she's look stupid anyway. </p>
<p>"No tuxes," Sam agreed. "Not even a frilly blue one with a
ruffly shirt," she added with a devilish smirk. Brooke smiled at her.
</p>
<p>"Terrific. Now about that great mind-blowing sex?" Brooke
started letting the rest of the comment hang and looking at Sam with a rather
lecherous look on her face. Sam blushed just looking at her. </p>
<p>"Check please!" Sam called out. </p>
