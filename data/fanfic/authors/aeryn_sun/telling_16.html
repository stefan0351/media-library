<!-- Telling Series \ Section 6: Mary Cherry - Two Tickets For The Express Train To Hell, Please -->

<p>"Oh mah Gawd! Oh mah Gawd! Oh mah Gawd! Oh mah Gawd! Oh mah Gawd!" Mary
Cherry exclaimed. Sam leaned over to whisper into Brooke's ear as they once
again found themselves playing out the great drama of their lives in the Novak.</p>
<p>"Is she praying for us, blessing us or damning us?" she asked dumbfounded.
Brooke shook her head slowly never removing her eyes from the kneeling form of
Mary Cherry who was still repeating those three words like a mantra. </p>
<p>"Oh mah Gawd! Oh mah Gawd! Oh mah Gawd! Oh mah Gawd! Oh mah Gawd!" </p>
<p>"I have no idea," Brooke whispered back with a frown. They both continued to
stare at the girl on the floor in front of them. Sam turned to Brooke to face
her. </p>
<p>"I've lost count, how many 'Oh my God's' is that?" Brooke shrugged. </p>
<p>"Three, four hundred?" Brooke answered looking back at Sam. Sam seemed to
consider this for a minute and then turned to Mary Cherry. </p>
<p>"If she hasn't answered you by now, Mary Cherry, she must be busy doing
something else. Now stand up and talk to us like a normal human being," she
stopped to ponder her words. She looked at Brooke. "Or whatever passes for
'normal' for Mary Cherry." </p>
<p>Mary Cherry suddenly stopped her chanting and sprang to her feet in one bound
reminding both Sam and Brooke of a Jack-in-the-Box. Sam could actually hear the
strains of 'Pop goes the weasel' in her head. Mary Cherry's eyes narrowed and
she pointed an accusing finger at them both. </p>
<p>"Y'all know what ya are? Y'all are evil. EEE-VEEELLLL!!!" Mary Cherry
shrieked. </p>
<p>"It speaks," Sam said dryly as Brooke shot her a dirty look and approached
Mary Cherry, palms out in the universal sign of peace. Mary Cherry backed away
and raised her purse as if to strike her. Brooke stopped and backtracked until
she was hidden slightly behind Sam who looked between the two of them in
confusion. Brooke pointed to the purse and Sam's eyes got wide. She knew what
Mary Cherry carried in that bag. Or was rumored to at least. She took a step
back as well, Brooke still behind her. </p>
<p>"Now, Mary Cherry, just calm down. There's no need for violence," Sam said
calmly, hoping to avoid bloodshed, most notably hers and Brooke's. Mary Cherry
waved the purse at them threateningly. </p>
<p>"Evil," she repeated. "There's a word fer it, y'all. It's in-cese." Sam burst
out laughing making Mary Cherry and Brooke jump. Sam looked at Brooke who was
now crouched behind her. </p>
<p>"Incense, get it? Incense?" Brooke tried to hide the smile to no effect. Mary
Cherry rolled her eyes. </p>
<p>"Ah know it's INCEST," she pronounced the word slowly and perfectly in
generic middle American english. "Don't be mockin' mah accent Sam-in-a-Can." Her
eyes narrowed further. "An' it's wrong, y'all. Just wrong. Y'all're goin' ta
Hell. It's against the Bible. It says a man shall not lie down wit' another
man." </p>
<p>"Then we're fine, neither of us is a man," Sam pointed out flatly. Mary
Cherry started to turn an alarming shade of red. Brooke hit Sam on the back. </p>
<p>"You're not helping," she hissed. Sam craned her neck to look at Brooke. </p>
<p>"Neither are you," Sam hissed back. "I know you like my ass but stop using it
as your personal shield and get out here, she's your friend, not mine." Brooke
sighed and stepped out from the safety of Sam's back to face Mary Cherry. </p>
<p>"Technically, Mary Cherry, it's not incest since we're not actually sisters.
There's no blood relation between us," Brooke explained simply. Mary Cherry
shook her head. </p>
<p>"Ah saw this ehgzact thing on Jerry just a few months ago," she started. </p>
<p>"Rikki," Sam broke in. Mary Cherry tilted her head confused. Sam thought she
resembled a constipated poodle. </p>
<p>"Huh?" </p>
<p>"Rikki Lake, you saw it on Rikki Lake," Sam clarified. Mary Cherry nodded.
</p>
<p>"Whatever, y'all. As Ah wuz sayin', she did this whole show on stepsisters
who were illicit lovers an' how it tore the fam'lies apart," Mary Cherry droned
on. Sam and Brooke exchanged tired looks. </p>
<p>"Mary Cherry, your point?" Brooke asked curtly. Mary Cherry glared. </p>
<p>"Y'all have earned yerselves one way tickets on the express train ta Hell,
that's mah point, Brookie. First class tickets, too." </p>
<p>"Christ, whatever," Sam mumbled, so not impressed by Mary Cherry's rantings.
Mary Cherry turned her attentions on Sam. </p>
<p>"What did y'all do to her? What lil' ol' spell did you put on poor ol'
Brookie ta turn her all gay, Spammie?" Sam looked at Mary Cherry like her head
had fallen off. </p>
<p>"What? How? What?" Sam sputtered. She put her hands on her cheeks and stared
flabbergasted through her fingers at Mary Cherry. </p>
<p>"You heard me, Sammie McQueerson, whaud ya do ta her ta make her become a
lez-be-ee-in-in-trainin'?" What started as a giggle grew into hysterical
laughter for Sam as she looked at Brooke for help. Brooke just shrugged. She had
NO idea what to say to that. She also had no idea what Sam found so damn funny.
</p>
<p>"Did ya slip a mickey in her protein drink?" Mary Cherry continued as Sam
slid to the floor, the hysterical laughter overwhelming her and making tears
slide down her face. Mary Cherry advanced on her until Brooke stood in her way.
</p>
<p>"Outta mah way, Brookie, this is between me an' Sammy McRainbow over there.
Think this is funny,huh? Well, Ah don't. Up until recently, Brookie wuz straight
as an arrow an' then you come along battin' yer big Bambi brown eyez at 'er an'
the next thing Ah know she's playin' fer the other team. Ya musta dun sumthin'
to her," Mary Cherry explained. Brooke sighed as Sam kept laughing, holding her
sides. Brooke didn't know what was worse, Mary Cherry's ranting or Sam's
laughing. </p>
<p>"Sam didn't do anything to me, Mary Cherry. No spells, no drugs, nothing. I'm
gay, not straight and I love her. Please stop laughing Sam, you're not helping."
Sam snorted at her and Brooke rolled her eyes. "Fine, whatever. Mary Cherry,
we're not evil, we're not committing incest and we're not going to Hell. OK?"
Sam hiccuped signifing the end of her laughing fit and stood back up. Brooke
shot her a dirty look. </p>
<p>"You done?" Sam smiled sheepishly as she wiped away the last of the laughter
induced tears. </p>
<p>"Yeah," hiccup, "sorry." </p>
