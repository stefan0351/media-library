<!-- A Promise Fulfilled \ Chapter Eight -->

<p>"A skiing trip? She fucking sprung for a skiing trip?" Nicole seethed as she paced the Novak like a caged panther and Mary Cherry watched mesmerized.</p>
<p>"I mean, can you believe that? A complete ski package for two...and Brookie plans on being the person who goes with her! How cozy," she scoffed bitterly.</p>
<p>Nicole had barely been able to believe her ears when Sam had called her the night before, excited to the point of annoying her, to squeal in delight about Brooke's gifts. The necklace alone was enough to make Nicole mad, but the trip absolutely enraged her.</p>
<p>&lt;How dare that bitch think that she can take MY girlfriend on a romantic trip for two? And she just expects me to roll over and take it. I think NOT&gt;</p>
<p>"Ah know," Mary Cherry added. "Jus' think, youah girlfreyand an' that blonde hussy homewrecker, cozyin' up by a roarin' fireplace. Wrapped up in a big ol' quilt, their young, nubile bodies pressed tagether providin' body heat ta chase away th' chill o'..."</p>
<p>"SHUT UP!" Nicole screamed as she shut her eyes against the onslaught of images that Mary Cherry's rant provided her with. She could see in her mind's eye Brooke putting the moves on Sam and Sam whole heartedly accepting it. The very thought of Brooke touching Sam in any sort of intimate way was enough to make Nicole physically ill. And that fact scared her. She didn't want to be THAT jealous of Brooke. It would give Brooke power that Nicole couldn't afford for her to have. And yet it was all she could think of.</p>
<p>"If she thinks that I'm just going to nod my head and move out of her way as she puts the moves on MY girl, she's got another thing coming," she declared.</p>
<p>"Jus' th' thought o' those two involved inna incestuous, carnal rendezvous...their hot, sweaty, panting bodies tangled tagether..."</p>
<p>"MARY CHERRY SHUT UP! YOU AREN'T HELPING!" Nicole glared at her. "And stop watching so many damn porn movies. I think they're rotting your brain." Mary Cherry actually had the grace to blush at this. They were silent for a few minutes as Nicole continued to pace.</p>
<p>"It's too bad y'all cain't jus' go wit' 'em," Mary Cherry offered quietly, afraid of setting Nicole off again. "Two's company, three's a crowd an' all. Unless it IS a porno..." she trailed off as Nicole glared in her direction again. Nic then stopped to think about the idea.</p>
<p>"Hmmm, you may have something there," she started. "I'm sure I could arrange something. But, if I just suddenly show up, Sam will know that I'm up to something and that'll put a crimp in my plans. She's not stupid...not bright but not stupid either. No, there has to be another spin I can put on it to make it seem like I'm doing her a favor and not trying to outdo Brooke," she thought out loud.</p>
<p>&lt;Now, how can I do this?&gt; she wondered. &lt;Besides, I think if it was just me, Sam and Brooke, blood will get spilled...and it won't be mine&gt;</p>
<p>"I know!" she exclaimed suddenly, making Mary Cherry jump. "As much as I loathe the idea, I'll spring for all her loser friends to go too. That way they can share in the little trip down memory lane with her. And you and I, of course, Mary Cherry." Mary Cherry nodded.</p>
<p>"First class, right, Nic?" Nicole nodded.</p>
<p>"Of course. Let the losers sit in coach. Shit, let them sit in the cargo hold for all I care. Yeah, I'll arrange for all of us to go and surprise Sam. She'll love it. She'll get to live out her father's promise with all her little friends," she said distastefully. "And I'll get to keep an eye on Brooke and make sure she knows what's mine." Mary Cherry arched an eyebrow at her.</p>
<p>"Nic, do ya actually LIKE Spammy er somethin'? Cuz yer awful possessive," she pointed out. Nicole's glare could have melted steel and Mary Cherry wisely shrunk away.</p>
<p>"Shut up you twit. We both know I'm just using her to get at Brooke and take control of the school. Control that should have been mine to begin with. But I can't let Brooke screw up my plans by getting in the way and making a play for Sam. Remember that, you backwater bumpkin," she snapped. "I do not care for Spam. She's just a tool. Got it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Nic."</p>
