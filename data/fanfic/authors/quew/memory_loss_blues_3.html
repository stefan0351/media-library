<!-- Memory Loss Blues \ Part 3 -->

<p>Once inside, they couldn't move for the amount of people that wanted to talk, be close to or simple watch the ex-drone. B'Elanna thankfully slipped into the background as soon as she could, letting Naomi take Seven forward and watching as the Captain and Chakotay chatted with Seven, the Doctor and the young child. She didn't know what she had been expecting when she had learned that she was to take the memory deficient Seven to the party, but this self-assured, funny and beautiful woman had not been it. She sighed, leaned her head back against the wall and sipped her drink, letting the noise of the party wash over her. </p>

		<p>Never at her best in a social situation, B'Elanna was thankful for her dark corner as the rest of the guests danced, talked or merely gazed at the ex-drone. Her eyes caught movement and she gaped as she saw Harry staggering toward the ex-drones' position, carrying a bunch of flowers that seemed nearly as big as he was. </p>

		<p>She was almost too far away to catch their conversation, but she strained and over the noise she heard Harry say,'Here, Seven,' shyly, handing her the flowers and looking like he wanted the floor to open up and swallow him whole. </p>

		<p>She took them and looked quite frankly blown away, her eyes widening as she took the huge bunch of flowers from him, sniffing them slightly. </p>

		<p>'I'm sorry?I don't know your name,' Seven had said, sounding thoroughly overwhelmed. </p>

		<p>Harry had smiled understandingly. 'Harry Kim,' he said, sticking out a hand, which, after juggling the flowers to the crook of her other arm, Seven had taken. </p>

		<p>'I was w-wondering if I might-' He'd begun, but it was as if Harry's gesture had opened a strange floodgate within the group, and people had clustered around the woman proffering gifts of their own. Neelix was waving an old bottle of Earth wine, while Sam Wildman was trying to give Seven a box tied with ribbon, and many other crewmembers swamped her, all clamoring to be heard.</p>

		<p>'I'm sorry,' The ex-drone kept repeating, 'I don't know your names. I'm so sorry.' </p>

		<p>At that moment, B'Elanna's heart went out to the woman, and she rose from her chair as if pulled by some invisible set of strings. She walked easily through the crowd, employing her strength to clear a quick path and not bothering to apologise to the people she barged through. Her eyes were locked on the blonde, who's eyes had started to fill up with tears as she apologized over and over for not being able to thank the gift-givers by their names. </p>

		<p>'Oh, is that the time?' She said, stepping into the middle of the group, knocking peoples outstretched hands away and making it look like a casual gesture. The arm that had knocked away the hands kept going and wound its way around Seven's waist, pulling her away from the group of people surrounding her. 'Look at that, we have to be up early.' She said, not even thinking about what she was saying but concentrating on getting them out in one piece. 'Early shifts, yes?' She looked at Seven, who nodded blankly, still slightly shocked. </p>

		<p>She pulled them through the crowd, only to be stopped by Paris as she reached the door. 'Heeeey!' He drawled - somehow, he'd found his way to the alcoholic drinks, despite the Captains' orders for a non-alcoholic gathering. 'Where ya goin'?' </p>

		<p>'Outta my way, Tom,' B'Elanna snarled, all traces of courteousness or politeness absent from her voice. </p>

		<p>'C'mon, B'Elanna!' He said, pulling a face. 'It's her party! Yeaah!' He did a strange little boogey on the spot and turned to face them once more, one hand reaching out for Seven's elbow. 'The birthday girl should get to choose when she leaves!' </p>

		<p>That shook Seven out of her shock, and B'Elanna looked up to see Seven's anguish filled eyes looking back. 'It's not my birthday, is it?' The ex-drone whispered. 'I don't?remember?' </p>

		<p>B'Elanna realized that Seven had not been dealing with the loss of her memories as well as people had assumed - she'd simply been hiding her shock, and it all seemed to be catching up with the poor woman. She squeezed Sevens' elbow. </p>

		<p>'No, it's not,' she whispered back, trying to convey her support through her touch, unfamiliar with the words needed to comfort the ex-drone now. Turning back, she was just in time to slap Tom's wandering hand away, at which he squealed. </p>

		<p>'Heeey!' </p>

		<p>'Leave it, Tom!' B'Elanna snapped, tightening her grip on Seven's arm. </p>

		<p>'I don' unnerstand,' The helmsman said, his face falling into a grimace. 'I just wanted to say hello!' </p>

		<p>'With your hands?!' B'Elanna snarled, mimicking his grabbing motions at chest height. She looked around - people were starting to converge on them once more, trying to grab Seven's attention. She suddenly felt very protective of her confused and vulnerable charge. </p>

		<p>'Look, we're leaving,' she said to no-one in particular. </p>

		<p>'Awwww, c'mon Lanna!' Tom said, making a last ditch dive for Seven once more. B'Elanna heard the blonde woman gasp and suddenly she was working on instinct. She judged the distances and as Tom came forward her arm went back, working up the momentum she'd need to launch forward like
			<i>this</i> and have it connect to his cheek like
			<i>that</i>?
		</p>

		<p>It had taken less than three seconds, and B'Elanna snarled in triumph at the crumpled helmsman. She grabbed Seven's arm and moved them resolutely toward the door, only to be pulled up short as they stepped through by the Captains' barked command for her to stop.</p>

		<p>Janeway looked from the dropped Paris to her Chief Engineer, 'B'Elanna, what are you doing?!' She growled. </p>

		<p>'My job!' The half-Klingon roared, reaching the end of her tether. 'You asked me to look after her, and I am! If you want to parade her around like a piece of meat, fine! But don't expect me to go back on my word and not do what's in her best interests when she needs it! At least I have honour!' </p>

		<p>And with that, she whisked the blonde out of the mess hall and away from all the crowds. </p>
