<p>It's so easy to get lost in her. In her eyes, her skin, the sweet scent of her hair, her smile, her laugh. To forget where you are, who's around you, what's going on. You just gaze into her eyes and everything is forgotten except that she is there. That she's looking back at you with eyes so full of love that you feel you're about to burst.</p>

<p>Whatever happened to the girl who would stutter and trip over her words when around this beautiful woman? I guess she passed on with the dodo, because when I'm around her now, there isn't much of a trace of that shy nervous wreck. She sees something in me- in me! And it's enough for me that she has said the words, that she loves me. It gives me a strength I never knew I could possibly possess.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Tara slipped from the dark night into the welcome haven of her room. She sat down on her bed and absentmindedly petted the dark furry head that suddenly appeared below her hand.
<i>I really need a better name for this poor cat! </i>Miss Kitty Fantastico, as the precocious kitten was currently being referred to, proceeded to cuddle up to her first mistress. Her other mistress's scent was all over Tara, and she purred fiercely, enjoying having two such loving humans. They had been good to take her away from that smelly pound, with dogs- <i>filthy animals! </i>spat the kitten mentally- so close by. She purred to the point of a motorboat as Tara absently stroked her. She missed her other mistress, the one who had pointed out the small ball of fuzz in the corner of a large cage and had thereby taken her in. No doubt the two humans had been marking each other before her mistress had returned home- their scents mingled on the one called Tara's clothes.</p>

<p>She loved the small ball of fluff on her lap. <i>Our kitten,</i> she smiled. The little motorboat was an affectionate playmate, and a great comfort in the night when she missed Willow. Somehow, the kitten always knew to curl up near her as she slept, a warm purring life-force reminding her of how much she was loved- for the kitten loved her, and Willow had chosen the kitten, and Willow loved her. Sometimes the beauty of that logically roundabout thought dazzled her. Willow loved her.</p>

<p>They had been &quot;together&quot; for little more than three weeks. It was profoundly intense for both of them. Even as they moved beyond friends, they continued in their spellwork together. Now, so open to the other's thoughts, feelings, base emotions, their magickal power was increased tenfold. Neither held much of anything back, and the things they could accomplish startled them both.</p>

<p>Tara smiled, recalling the simple joys of the day. She went to class, and was 'picked up' by her girlfriend, who simply met her and they walked to her next class together. Then they parted with a quick hug- both were still uncomfortable with PDAs. Later, she picked up Willow at the hacker's last class and they just merely walked around campus quietly talking. Impulsively, on the way back to Willow's dorm, Tara stopped at a small flower vendor. The old woman sold her a single red rose, and she gleefully sneaked up behind Willow with the exquisite blossom. Holding it behind her back, she tapped the hacker on a shoulder. When Willow turned around, she handed the rose shyly to the other girl. For her troubles, Tara received a long kiss. She could still feel the tingle of Willow's lips on hers as she remembered the hacker's broad smile and single happy tear.</p>

<p>Slowly, the day caught up with her, and she yawned. Miss Kitty Fantastico follow suit, and Tara rose to get ready for bed. As she flicked off the single light in her room, she sent a brief thought to Willow and slid under the covers. The small kitten curled up next to her, and they drifted off to sleep.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Willow snuggled down under a pile of blankets, and glanced over at Buffy, who was curled up under her own pile of sheets and comforters. Her friend was turned with her back to the hacker, and the slayer's uneven breathing was enough evidence that Buffy was awake.</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy?&quot; she whispered.</p>

<p>&quot;Mmm, yeah Will?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You up for talking?&quot;</p>

<p>The slayer turned over and faced her friend. &quot;Sure, Will. What do you want to talk about?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I dunno. It just seems like maybe we don't talk as much as we used to.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We don't. But we've got classes, I've got Riley, you've got Tara, it's understandable.&quot; Buffy smiled in the darkness. &quot;So how is Tara?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>Willow let her smile reach epic proportions. &quot;Really good, Buffy. Really good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm happy for ya, Wills. She's a great girl. Maybe we could double date sometime- y'know, let us get to know each other a little better.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think she'd like that, a lot,&quot; mused Willow, remembering her friend's almost totally hidden hurt over having been kept a secret for so long.</p>

<p>Buffy grinned. &quot;We'll have to do it then. So, Will, was she the one that gave you that rose?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mmhmm,&quot; mumbled Willow, blushing as she recalled the kiss she'd given her girlfriend.</p>

<p>&quot;That is pretty darn romantic there, you hooked a good one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, yeah, I did.&quot; Willow leaned up and punched her pillow absentmindedly. &quot;Did I ever remember to thank you for giving me that little kick in the butt?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nah, but it's okay. I'd do anything for my Wills.&quot; The slayer imperceptibly shook her head, &quot;As soon as I paid attention to the two of you, together, I could see you both were totally head over heels.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow blushed again, and smiled. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she said softly, as her best friend grinned.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>She was almost asleep, almost, with a two pound ball of kitty curled up possessively against her head on the pillow. Her pager beeped, loudly, and vibrated, startling the cat and vibrating itself onto the floor. She cursed lightly, and pulled herself out of bed to check the page. She stared at the number for a long time, trying to remember where she knew it from. Then a flash of memory caught up with her and she lost her hold on the pager. Fumbling, she picked it up and checked the number before dialing it on the phone.</p>

<p>&quot;Sunnydale General Hospital, how may I help you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I need to speak to Dr. Bates, please, he just paged me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;May I ask who's calling and what for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's Tara Ross, and I'm calling about my sister.&quot;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>The conversation was quiet, and calm, reminiscent of a hundred conversations they'd had in high school about anything and everything. Drifting off to sleep, they were both a little annoyed when the phone rang. Buffy pulled herself out of bed first, and went to answer it.</p>

<p>She listened for a few minutes, provided the proper responses, and hung up. &quot;It's Faith,&quot; she said, not looking at her best friend. &quot;Dr. Bates says she's waking up.&quot;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Tara arrived at the hospital quickly, parking her old Acura haphazardly in a space meant for some doctor. She whispered a quick &quot;No Towing&quot; spell over the car and raced inside. She knew the corridors well, having visited every week since she'd arrived in Sunnydale from Boston. She waved at the various nurses, who smiled back at the young woman, and weaved her way in and out of the carts, moving beds, and wheelchair bound patients until she reached a far corridor. Quick spellwork the first time she'd visited had neutralized the Watcher who had been waiting for her sister to wake up. The woman had returned to England with a fake death certificate that she'd conjured, believing Faith was dead. The police had forgotten about her sister, so she knew no one would probably care or notice that she was there.</p>

<p>A doctor stood beside her sister's bedside, carefully monitoring vital signs. He smiled at her, &quot;Hello Miss Ross, I think your sister will be waking up within a day. Her vitals and brain activity are returning to normal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Doctor Bates,&quot; replied Tara, hurrying to Faith's bedside and taking a frail hand in her own. She could feel the dark slayer's mind returning to her body, could feel the barrier Faith had put up dissolving.</p>

<p>&quot;Well now, I think it's okay for me to leave for a minute. I have a phone call to make,&quot; said the jovial man. He rustled away in a mass of papers and clipboards, to call a young woman who had insisted she be informed the moment Faith woke up. He put the phone to his ear and dialed, &quot;Miss Summers?&quot;</p>

<p>Tara knew little of what had happened to her sister. They'd not spoken for a period of about three months before she'd been called about her sister's injuries, and she guessed that Faith had finally given in to her dark side. She could only pray that the dark slayer hadn't hurt too many people. She patted the hand she held, and started to sing. Even as children, her sister had loved to hear her sing. A young Faith, slight and slighted, had said in her child's way that her big sister's singing chased the demons away. Tara wished that was literally true.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>They called Giles and Xander, then rushed towards the hospital. It took a long time to weave their way through the unfamiliar corridors. Buffy had visited almost every day during the summer, but once college started she'd stopped going, and Faith had been moved in the meantime. The Scoobies, with Watcher in tow, finally arrived at the nurse's station on Faith's wing. They spotted Dr. Bates immediately, the big man's girth and smile unmistakable. &quot;Dr. Bates!&quot; called out Buffy, and he ambled over to them.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello Miss Summers, Miss Rosenberg,&quot; he said, smiling at the group even though he didn't recognize half of them. &quot;Miss Ross should be waking up within a day or so. Her sister is in there with her now, but when she's done I won't have any problem with letting you in to visit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Ross?&quot; said Buffy with a confused look, &quot;We're here about Faith. And she doesn't have a sister that we know of.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, her sister showed up a few months ago, quite a kind girl, and filled in the rest of your friend Faith's information,&quot; replied the doctor, nonplussed.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess that's good,&quot; Willow offered. &quot;We'll be in the waiting area, Doctor, so if you could have some one tell us when Faith's sister is gone?&quot; She practically dragged her best friend towards the chairs.</p>

<p>&quot;Could it be the Watchers?&quot; Buffy demanded of Giles.</p>

<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; replied the stuffy ex-Watcher. &quot;I don't know why, but my sources in the Council believe that Faith is dead. Not too long after you stopped visiting on a regular basis, they say that the Watcher assigned to keep tabs on Faith returned to England with a death certificate bearing Faith's name and description- though without her last name, I believe. No one ever knew that piece of information, or anything about a sister.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then who is in there with Faith?&quot; hissed Buffy. &quot;Willow, would you mind wandering in, find out who's there?&quot; she asked her best friend. The hacker nodded, and slipped away towards Faith's room. She turned to her Watcher, saying, &quot;If I went in, and it was a Council person, they'd recognize me. And Wills can talk her way out of anything if there's a problem.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, quite,&quot; replied Giles, rubbing his throbbing temple. The situation was giving him quite a headache.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Willow slipped through the hallway, casting a slight spell over herself so no one would think it out of place for her to be where she was. Faith's room was dimmed, the light barely illuminating the banks of monitors hooked up to her greatest enemy. The curtain was half closed, blocking her view of whoever was holding Faith's hand. And singing. The voice was thick and rich, mellow against the harshness of the hospital setting. It seemed familiar somehow, and Willow inched slowly closer, trying to catch a glimpse of Faith's &quot;sister.&quot; She couldn't believe the dark slayer would have a sibling, let alone one that would care enough to journey out to Sunnydale.</p>

<p>She stood dumbfounded as she looked at the woman sitting next to Faith's bedside. &quot;Tara,&quot; she said, surprise coloring her tone.</p>

<p>The blond wiccan turned sharply, surprise etched on her face, &quot;Willow?&quot; she said, letting go of Faith's hand and rising from her seat, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The question should be what are you doing here, Tara?&quot; said a voice from the doorway. Buffy's face was angry, and she stalked into the room with Giles and Xander mere steps behind her.</p>

<p>&quot;I have a right to be here,&quot; said the wiccan defiantly, &quot;I'm her sister. Now what are you doing here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm here to make sure a dangerous killer isn't going to hurt anyone else, especially not my friends,&quot; said Buffy, slipping a steadying arm around her best friend who seemed about to faint.</p>

<p>Tara's face whitened until she was as pale as the sheets around Faith, and sat down, not trusting her wobbly legs. &quot;Oh goddess,&quot; she whispered, staring at her sister's face. &quot;What have you done now, sis?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>Faith chose that moment to slowly blink and open her eyes. Tara leaned forward, brushing a lock of hair away from her sister's face. Faith glanced up at the ceiling and then her eyes caught sight of pale blond hair and a familiar face. &quot;Tara?&quot; she croaked, lips breaking into a faint smile. &quot;What are you doing here? It's not safe, the Mayor...&quot; Her mind ran through a hundred thoughts in a few seconds. &quot;How... how long?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Eight months,&quot; said Buffy from the end of the bed, where she stood angrily glaring at her enemy.</p>

<p>The dark slayer jumped at the sound of the angry voice. &quot;B, now you leave my sister alone, she won't hurt anyone,&quot; she croaked, voice rough with sleep and injury. Then the information Buffy had shared sunk in. &quot;Eight months?&quot; she asked, looking to Tara for confirmation. The wiccan merely nodded, and took hold of Faith's hand. &quot;The Mayor?&quot; she asked Tara.</p>

<p>&quot;Who?&quot; replied the wiccan, turning to Buffy with a confused look.</p>

<p>&quot;He's dead. We killed him. And he killed half our class. Too bad I didn't aim a little better, or you'd be with him,&quot; said the blond slayer bitterly.</p>

<p>Tara felt her anger rising at that statement, &quot;You... did this?&quot; she asked Buffy, gesturing at her sister's battered body. &quot;You're supposed to help people, goddammit, not practically kill them!&quot; she said loudly, not caring about who heard.</p>

<p>Xander went and closed the door to the room, then sullenly stalked over to Tara, &quot;And she's not supposed to kill people either,&quot; he said angrily, as Faith shuddered in recollection of her deeds.</p>

<p>Tara paled again, and fell into her chair, &quot;Faith?&quot; she asked, as her sister turned away from her. &quot;Oh, goddess,&quot; she muttered.</p>

<p>Willow had remained silent throughout the entire exchange, leaning against Giles in shock. She came out of her surprise slowly, and walked towards her girlfriend, &quot;Tara?&quot; she said again. &quot;Is Faith really your sister?&quot; she asked, gripping Tara's shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, she is,&quot; said Tara slowly, unsure as to how Willow felt about the dark slayer.</p>

<p>&quot;You can sound more ashamed then that, Tar,&quot; said Faith with her back still to the group. &quot;I know you are ashamed of me, and you don't know half of what I've done.&quot;</p>

<p>Tara ripped her attention from Willow, and gently pulled Faith to her, until their eyes could meet, only a few scant inches apart. &quot;I never was ashamed of you, and I never will be,&quot; she said hotly, intently. &quot;You are my sister and I love you.&quot;</p>

<p>Faith's eyes slowly watered, and Tara pulled the frail body of her sister close, rocking the younger woman gently and humming. Soon Faith was sobbing in her sister's embrace as the Scooby gang looked on, shock evident on their faces.</p>

<p>Something seemed to shake Faith from her grief, and she sat upright, still in Tara's embrace, &quot;The Watchers! Oh god, they're gonna come after me! And the cops!&quot; she said, panicking.</p>

<p>&quot;No, they won't. I sent that Watcher back to England with a death certificate. She thinks you're dead. And the cops are Sunnydale cops, you know they've already forgotten about you,&quot; replied Tara comfortingly. &quot;No one's after you, I promise.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Except them,&quot; said Faith, softly pointing at the Scoobs. &quot;I hurt them too much for them to forgive me,&quot; she said to her sister, whispering so that the other people in the room wouldn't hear.</p>

<p>Tara bent her head, and pale blond hair covered her face for a moment. &quot;I wouldn't worry about that,&quot; she replied softly.</p>

<p>&quot;I would,&quot; said Buffy, her slayer-hearing having picked up the entire exchange. &quot;You have no idea what Faith did, Tara, and I don't care if you are Willow's girlfriend, you're not going to keep me from making sure she pays for her crimes.&quot;</p>

<p>Faith's eyes widened. She glanced at her sister, who was blushing and angry at the same time, then towards Willow, who stood like a deer in headlights under the dark slayer's gaze, &quot;Geez, Tara, you finally decided to come out huh? Could you have possibly chosen a girlfriend that hates me less?&quot; she said, a slight note of teasing entering her voice.</p>

<p>Tara's eyes widened, and a slightly wicked gleam entered her eyes. She started to tickle her sister, and Faith writhed laughing under the tickle attack. &quot;Why would Willow hate you?&quot; she asked her sister, honestly confused.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know, maybe because Faith put Willow in the hospital!&quot; answered Xander angrily.</p>

<p>Tara stopped the tickle attack instantly, and looked at her girlfriend, who nodded, then at Buffy who was furious. &quot;I think someone needs to fill me in,&quot; she said softly. Then she noticed that Faith was a little pale. &quot;But I also think that you need to sleep,&quot; she said to her sister, sliding off the bed and tucking the younger woman in gently.</p>

<p>&quot;But I've been in a coma for eight months!&quot; argued Faith childishly.</p>

<p>Tara glared at her for a second, then said, &quot;Sleep, and I'll be back in the morning, I promise.&quot;</p>

<p>Faith looked away for a moment, &quot;They're gonna tell you their side of the story, you know,&quot; she said, continuing only when Tara had nodded, &quot;Just...&quot; she couldn't finish the sentence.</p>

<p>&quot;I won't let them hurt you,&quot; said Tara hotly, &quot;and I'll wait to make up my mind after I've heard what you have to say. You know me better than that, Faith.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; replied Faith, eyes watering a little. Tara went to kiss her forehead, and Faith wrapped her arms around the blonde. &quot;I've missed you,&quot; she said, voice pleading.</p>

<p>Tara pulled out of the embrace, and smiled, &quot;I've missed you too, sis,&quot; she said, wiping Faith's tears away. &quot;Love you,&quot; she added.</p>

<p>&quot;Love you too,&quot; replied the dark slayer, hope filling her eyes at that statement.</p>

<p>Tara turned to her friends, who glared at her angrily. Even Giles seemed very upset. &quot;I guess we all have some explaining to do. Let's go back to Mr. Giles' place and talk, okay?&quot; she said, exhausted, amazed that she wasn't reverting to her normal shyness.</p>

<p>&quot;What about her?&quot; said Buffy and Xander simultaneously.</p>

<p>&quot;She'll be here in the morning,&quot; replied Tara, glancing at her dozing little sister. &quot;She knows that if she doesn't listen to me, there's hell to pay,&quot; she added, trying to reassure her friends.</p>

<p>&quot;I trust you, Tara,&quot; said Willow softly, &quot;but I don't trust Faith.&quot;</p>

<p>Tara seemed to take that sentence as a blow. &quot;Please, Willow, I promise she'll be here in the morning,&quot; she pleaded, stepping towards the hacker but unsure as to how welcome her touch would be at the moment.</p>

<p>Willow seemed to shrink inside of herself for a moment, and wrapped her arms around herself. &quot;Okay,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Come on, guys, I think we all need to talk and calm down a little,&quot; she said to her friends.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Tara was glad she was going to Mr. Giles alone. A few minutes to herself in the car was a welcome relief from the tension amongst the Scoobs. She sat in the car for a long moment, then rustled among the tapes scattered in the back seat before popping one in. The soft strains of her sister's favorite tape played over the car's sound system, and she was about to put the Acura in gear when someone tapped at the passenger side window. She glanced at the form, and reached over quickly to unlock the door so that a redheaded hacker could slip into the seat next to her.</p>

<p>&quot;Willow,&quot; she said quietly, gripping the wheel until her knuckles turned white.</p>

<p>&quot;So Faith is your sister,&quot; said the hacker calmly.</p>

<p>&quot;Half sister, really,&quot; replied Tara. &quot;Same dad, different moms. I was one when my parents split, and then dad got Faith's mom pregnant. It was kinda ironic, since our moms were best friends.&quot; She laughed without a hint of humor in her voice. &quot;Faith's mom bailed on her when she was five, and she came to live with us till my mom died. Then we lived with my grandmother. Faith's Watcher showed up a few years later and we both stayed with her until Kakistos.&quot; She shoved the memories back and turned to her girlfriend, who was staring straight ahead. &quot;I guess we'd better go over to Mr. Giles', huh?&quot; she said softly, putting the car in gear. With that, they left the hospital parking lot.</p>

<p>The drive was mostly silent, except for the tape playing. The sounds of Tracy Chapman filled the small space, <i>At this point in my life I've don so many things wrong I don't know if I can do right</i></p>

<p>&quot;This is Faith's favorite tape,&quot; offered Tara in a small voice.</p>

<p>Willow looked over at her, honestly surprised. &quot;Tracy Chapman? Faith likes Tracy Chapman? I thought she was all about that horrible rave music?&quot;</p>

<p>Tara smiled, and shook her head. &quot;She likes that stuff for dancing. But at home she'd always be listening to Tracy Chapman or the Indigo Girls or something like that. It fit her image to be all dark and sexy and dangerous, but she's really such a softy.&quot;</p>

<p><i>At this point in my life I'd like to live as if only love mattered as if redemption was in sight</i></p>

<p>&quot;What did she do to you?&quot; Tara asked softly, almost afraid to hear the answer.</p>

<p>Willow sighed, &quot;She put me in the hospital. Beat me senseless. She was working for the Mayor at the time... He was trying to turn into a giant snake...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She told me about his plans before... before we lost touch. That must have been before she... lost control,&quot; replied Tara. &quot;I'm sorry, and I'm sure she's sorry too.&quot; She hesitantly put her hand on Willow's, who gripped it tightly. Holding hands, they were silent the rest of the way to Giles' house.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Buffy, Xander, and Giles were clearly surprised to see Tara and Willow walk in the door holding hands. The three were set in anger, feeling not a little betrayed not to have known about Faith having a sister, let alone a sister already so close to the Scooby gang. And they were still angry with Faith for all the pain the dark slayer had caused. They also were suspicious now of Tara. So to see the wiccan and the hacker apparently at ease with each other was disconcerting.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey,&quot; said Tara, smiling a little. She sat down on Giles' couch and waited until Willow sat next to her to curl up a little against the hacker. &quot;I guess you want the full story, huh? Well, so do I, but I'll go first, otherwise I might fall asleep halfway through.&quot; She sighed as the three facing her stood in silence, and prayed her stuttering wouldn't return.</p>

<p>&quot;Faith and I are half-sisters. Same dad, different moms. My folks split when I was one, and then dad got Faith's mom pregnant. Our moms were best friends. So we sorta grew up together for awhile. When Faith was five, her mom's alcoholism took over, and Faith got left with us as her mom disappeared. Dad had vanished years ago, so it was just us and my mom, and my grandma. Mom struggled to raise us both, working two jobs. So keeping an eye on Faith sort of fell to me. I didn't do a very good job. When she was ten, she fell in with a bad crowd, I guess. Mom couldn't do much, neither could Gram, and I was just starting seventh grade... Mom died later that year, and we lost what little stability we had. Gram lived on social security, we didn't have a lot. Faith would show up with new clothes, or food, and we didn't dare question it because we needed that stuff. I thought it was just a little petty theft, and I was a teenager, so I didn't care much. It was a lot worse...&quot;</p>

<p>She took a deep breath, and continued when she felt Willow squeeze her hand. &quot;She was selling drugs, and her body, to buy that stuff for us. I found out when a guy I knew bragged he'd gotten her for free. He'd... he'd, well, I guess you can figure out what happened. She was only thirteen then. Things got so much worse over the next couple of years. She'd started doing stuff, pot and E and a couple other drugs, to escape. Luckily she never touched alcohol, I guess she learned something from her mom. She had such a bad rep, and had dropped out of school. Guys started coming after me, thinking I was like her... She'd beat them up, and I got left alone after a few guys came to school with busted ribs, all black and blue. Then her Watcher showed up at the house. Gram was gone down to church, it was just the two of us there. Her Watcher, Gwen, was so nice, and she seemed honest enough. Faith started training as a Slayer, and I insisted Gram start teaching me about magic, so I could help her. Gwen had said that the last Slayer had had a powerful witch as her sidekick, and that it had really helped keep her alive. We didn't know that Buffy had never really died, I don't think Gwen did either. We all thought Faith was the only Slayer... Then Kakistos came, and neither of us could do anything. We saw Gwen get gutted right in front of us...&quot; Tara drew in a deep breath, and shuddered until Willow wrapped a comforting arm around her.</p>

<p>&quot;Faith disappeared, but she kept sending me postcards and letters. She told me about hitching across country, running from Kakistos so that he'd leave me alone. Then when she got here... she started to tell me about you guys, just without using names. She called you guys B, and X-man, and the Watcher, and Red, plus wolf-man and the prom queen. I never put it all together until after Willow introduced me to you, I swear. By then, I guessed something had gone wrong, and I didn't dare say anything. I knew she was in the hospital, but never could find out why. I graduated from high school, got a scholarship to UCS, and came here looking for my sister.&quot; Tara drew in a deep breath, and looked at her audience, who sat grimly around her, taking in the story. Willow's eyes were sad, but she couldn't read the others. &quot;What happened here?&quot; she asked, needing to know.</p>

<p>&quot;I think I should tell the story,&quot; said Giles. &quot;The rest of you might become too... emotional...&quot; With that, the Watcher began the story of Faith's arrival, then refused to gloss over how the dark slayer had turned to the Mayor's side. Tara listened to the story, at first shocked, then upset, then crushingly sad and guilty over not having kept her sister from turning to the wrong side.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then Buffy stabbed Faith and your sister slipped into a coma. We were just lucky we were able to stop the Ascension, though the class of 99 paid a heavy price,&quot; finished Giles.</p>

<p>Tara sat quietly for a long few minutes. &quot;I can see why you hate her,&quot; she said finally. &quot;But the Faith I know wouldn't have done that. Gwen's death must have really affected her more than I realized... She always had that dark side, but I never thought she'd really give into it. Goddess, I'm sorry,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;Please, forgive her. The Faith in the hospital now is the Faith I know. Please, she's my little sister.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Some little sister,&quot; growled Xander. &quot;Do you know what your precious little sister did to your girlfriend?&quot; he asked angrily.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I do.&quot; Tara laid her hand on Willow's leg, and snuggled even closer to the hacker.</p>

<p>&quot;Xander,&quot; said Willow, &quot;I don't trust Faith farther than I could throw her. But I do trust Tara, and for her I'm willing to give Faith one more chance.&quot; She locked eyes with her childhood friend for a long few moments, then smiled as she saw him give in.</p>

<p>&quot;You know nothing can stand against 'resolve face,' Will, that's just not fair,&quot; he said, throwing up his hands. &quot;But I want her to stay away from me! And Anya!&quot;</p>

<p>Tara glanced at Willow, confusion on her face at Xander's reaction. Willow whispered in her ear, &quot;Faith relieved Xander of his virginity, then kicked him out the next morning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; she said, shaking her head. &quot;I don't think it meant much to her. Faith's gay,&quot; she said softly, to her girlfriend.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; replied Willow. &quot;But what about...&quot; she was about to refer to Faith's stint as a prostitute, but decided against it.</p>

<p>&quot;She did that for money, and I couldn't convince her to stop. But she had a couple of serious girlfriends before she became the Slayer.&quot;</p>

<p>After Giles cleared his throat, the pair rejoined the larger conversation. Buffy was staring at her feet, trying to decide what to say.</p>

<p>&quot;Look, I know I used to really hate Faith, but I didn't really understand her all that much either. It was easier to just say she was evil than to think maybe she had reasons for what she did. And maybe I still don't understand her. But I didn't sense that Faith was still evil, or nasty, or anything, after I took a second to really look at her. She used to be my friend. So I guess, I'll give her another chance,&quot; she said finally, staring at her hands. &quot;Giles?&quot;</p>

<p>The Watcher cleared his throat again. &quot;Well, I suppose she's deserving of another chance,&quot; he said. &quot;But only one, in my book,&quot; he added.</p>

<p>Tara smiled at her friends, &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said. &quot;If you don't mind, I'd like to go home. I've got to get my room ready for having an extra occupant. Faith should be out of the hospital soon.&quot;</p>

<p>Giles looked meekly at the group, then offered, &quot;She could stay here instead. I've got the room, and that flea ridden hotel of hers is awful, not to mention that the town repossessed her apartment that the Mayor gave her.&quot;</p>

<p>Tara's smile reached epic proportions. &quot;That'd be wonderful, Mr. Giles. I can bring over some of her things that I brought from home tomorrow, after I visit her at the hospital.&quot; Impulsively, she went over and hugged the Watcher, then turned to the rest of the group, &quot;Thank you, so much. And goodnight.&quot; She went outside, and Willow followed her, shutting the door behind them.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey,&quot; said the hacker softly, moving into Tara's arms with ease.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you so much, Wills,&quot; replied the blonde wiccan, nuzzling fine red hair. &quot;I know this couldn't have been easy for you, after what you say Faith did.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow moved even closer to her girlfriend, &quot;It isn't. I'm still expecting her to jump out at me and put me back in intensive care. But I trust you, Tara. I love you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love you too. Would you like a ride back to the dorms?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure, just let me tell Buffy,&quot; replied the hacker, moving out of the embrace. &quot;Want me to stay overnight with you?&quot; she asked impishly.</p>

<p>Tara laughed, lightly. &quot;That'd be wonderful,&quot; she answered, kissing the redhead's nose.</p>

<p>Willow opened the door, and called to her best friend to relay her plans. Buffy hooted in glee, and the hacker blushed. She glanced at her girlfriend, who was smiling broadly at her embarrassment. Lightly elbowing the taller girl, she closed the door and led the way towards where they'd parked.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>They were shy with each other, though they'd slept in the same bed a dozen times before, as friends and later as girlfriends. They didn't immediately cuddle together as they often did, nor did their kitten jump up to join them on the bed. It was as if the secret of Tara's past sat between them, keeping them apart. The room was silent but for the tape Tara had taken from the car and put in to play. She needed the reminder of her sister, and so Tracy Chapman continued to sing, her soft voice and music filling in the silence between wiccan and hacker.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier,&quot; said Tara finally, turning to face her girlfriend in the room's low light.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think I would have reacted so well if I knew earlier. Seeing Faith again, so small and fragile and helpless maybe put things into perspective,&quot; replied Willow reassuringly, reaching out hesitantly to run her fingers through fine blond hair. Tara moaned at the gentle contact, and carefully her fingers traced the outline of her girlfriend's face.</p>

<p>They slowly moved towards each other, bodies fitting together snugly like a couple of puzzle pieces. Willow pulled Tara close, resting the taller girl's head on her shoulder and holding her close in the darkness.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe it was meant to be, that I learned about the other side of you now,&quot; said Willow softly.</p>

<p>Tara nodded a little, &quot;Maybe.&quot; She raised her head, and gently kissed the hacker. &quot;I love you, now go to sleep. It's going to be a busy day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love you, too, Tara, family and all,&quot; replied Willow, kissing her girlfriend back.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>The doctors at the hospital were surprised when Faith was physically ready to leave within forty-eight hours of waking up. By the time Tara arrived, her sister was already arguing with a nurse, demanding that she be given some clothes so she could leave with her sibling.</p>

<p>The nurse was absolutely exasperated at her patient's behavior. She cast a grateful eye at Tara, who stood with her arms folded over her chest, glaring at Faith from the doorway. The nurse scooted out of the room with Faith's protests ringing in her ears.</p>

<p>&quot;Quiet down, Faith, you're disturbing the entire wing,&quot; said Tara, sitting down next to the frail slayer. &quot;And eat this glop that they're passing off as food or I won't take you home tomorrow.&quot;</p>

<p>Faith's eyes shined at the mention of her imminent release, but eyed the food suspiciously. &quot;What the hell is this supposed to be, anyway?&quot; she asked, poking something brownish with her fork.</p>

<p>Tara read the menu out loud, amazed that the variously-colored piles of goo were supposedly, &quot;Salisbury steak, sweet potatoes, and corn with chicken soup and jello.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You've got to be kidding, Tar,&quot; the slayer replied, &quot;that doesn't look a thing like Salisbury steak.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's sure not the same as Gram's is, but eat it.&quot; Tara took the spoon off the tray and lifted up a bite of potato to her sister's mouth, &quot;Unless, of course, you want to play airplane and I'll feed you.&quot; She only laughed at the dark glare she was given and settled back as Faith shoveled the food into her mouth, trying not to taste it as she chewed. When the slayer was done, she settled back and pushed the hospital rolling table away from her.</p>

<p>&quot;Now what?&quot; she asked her sister. &quot;Do you want to hear my side of the story or are you going to fill me in?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll listen to you first,&quot; replied Tara, taking her sister's hand gently. &quot;I already heard the Scooby's side last night, and I want to hear yours now.&quot;</p>

<p>Faith seemed to shrink into the bedclothes, and pulled her hand from her sister's grasp. &quot;Not much to tell, sis. I accidentally staked a guy, who was a bad guy, if you care, I freaked, I turned bad, worked for a psycho mayor, went after B's boytoy, put Red in the hospital, and slept with Xander. Not much more than that. I screwed up, and I got put into a coma for it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But why?&quot; persisted Tara, forcefully taking her sister's hand again.</p>

<p>Faith smiled grimly, &quot;I don't know. It seemed to make sense at the time. I was just so angry, Tar, I just wanted to hurt everyone. Especially the Scoobs. They were so nice to me. They didn't even know how much of a slut or a whore or a druggie I was. B had everything- the great best friend, a hunky, if undead, guy, everything I never had. All I had was you and Gram, and I screwed that up when Kakistos killed Gwen.&quot; She stared at the wall, &quot;I'd do anything to take it all back, Tara, but I don't know how.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They're going to give you another chance, you know. I know you, Faith. You're good and kind and strong and smart. Show them the side of you that I know. You can make it up to them, I'm sure.&quot; Tara rose from her chair and slid onto the bed beside her sister, pulling the other girl close and slipping an arm around her.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm none of those things. I'm a killer, and a whore and a bitch.&quot; Faith let the tears slide down her cheeks, flinching when Tara moved to gently wipe them away.</p>

<p>&quot;No you aren't,&quot; said a voice from the doorway. Willow stepped into the room warily, moving to her girlfriend's side quickly. She kissed Tara briefly on the cheek, then stepped to the other side of the bed and sat facing her former enemy. &quot;You made some mistakes, Faith. And after talking with your sister, I realize how quick I was to judge you. You aren't the only one who screwed up. Maybe me and the others pushing you away was too hard, and you snapped. But the Faith I see in front of me isn't my enemy. She's my family.&quot;</p>

<p>Faith looked up, incredulous. &quot;How can you, of all people, forgive me? I hurt you so much, I beat you up and slept with the guy you had a crush on, and tried to kill your best friend.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow shrugged. &quot;I just can. If you can forgive me for pushing you away, that is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Red, you're incredible,&quot; replied Faith, shaking. The hacker blushed, and shook her head.</p>

<p>&quot;Look, I've got some stuff to do. I'll be back here in an hour or so, so why don't you two catch up and I'll come to pick Tara up later, okay?&quot; Willow rose, and gently placed her hand on Faith's shoulder. &quot;It's good to have you back, Faith,&quot; she said before walking out the door.</p>

<p>Faith stared after her for a moment, &quot;You sure hooked a good one, sis,&quot; she said finally. &quot;Now, I want details!&quot;</p>

<p>Tara blushed even darker than her girlfriend had, and started to catch her sister up on eight months of her life.</p>

<p>&quot;So, you're going to be staying with Mr. Giles. My dorm room is a little too small for both of us,&quot; she finished.</p>

<p>&quot;Rooming with the G-Man, how cool is that?&quot; said Faith, rolling her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I brought a good chunk of your stuff with me out here, so Willow and I are going to fix up his spare room for you this afternoon. And he's really very nice,&quot; replied Tara.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you bring my clothes?&quot; Faith asked.</p>

<p>&quot;No, because you wouldn't fit in any of them anymore. I just brought your stereo, and music collection and posters and books and stuff. Gram gave me a lot of her magic equipment before I left, but I keep those things in my room. I can bring over some candles and incense if you want, though.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, that'd be great. How is Gram?&quot;</p>

<p>Tara sighed, &quot;She's worried about you. When we get you out of here, we're going to sit down and call her, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure. Five by five,&quot; replied Faith, sorrow creasing her features.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey now, don't look so sad. I didn't even tell her you were hurt, I just said I couldn't find you. I didn't want to worry her too much. Now, we're gonna measure you, because I can't have you walking out of here in a hospital gown. We're gonna go shopping for some basic clothes this afternoon before we go to Mr. Giles.&quot; Tara pulled out a tape measure, and was about to start measuring her sister, when Faith spoke up.</p>

<p>&quot;Look, I'm only a few sizes bigger. I'll jot them down for you. None of this damn measuring stuff, okay?&quot; she argued.</p>

<p>&quot;You're so stubborn. Fine, but if the clothes don't fit, don't come complaining to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I won't,&quot; grinned Faith, &quot;but don't get me any of those clothes like you wear. I'm not into the hippie outsider scene, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am <b>not</b> buying you leather. Jeans and t-shirts okay?&quot; said Tara.</p>

<p>The slayer pouted at the leather ban. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she said sullenly. &quot;Get me a UCS sweatshirt, okay? I'm proud my big sis got into college.&quot;</p>

<p>Tara smiled. &quot;You're smart. Nothing says you can't get a GED in a couple of months and start going to school with me in the fall. I know high school wasn't your scene, but I think you'd like higher education.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That would require money we don't have,&quot; Faith pointed out.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't have any money either. I got a scholarship. And with what your GED and SAT scores could easily be, they'll be falling all over themselves to give you money. We both know who's the smarter one here,&quot; Tara said, smoothing the hair on her sister's brow gently.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey,&quot; said a voice from the doorway, &quot;sorry to break up the family reunion, but we've got stuff to do.&quot; Willow stepped into the room confidently, and grinned at the siblings. She held something behind her back, and walked up to Faith smiling. &quot;Here, Tara said you'd be bored out of your mind in here alone, so she had me stop and pick up a couple of books for you.&quot; The hacker took from behind her a small bag with 'Barnes &amp; Noble' emblazoned on the front.</p>

<p>Faith's eyes started to gleam when she sighted the bag, and Willow could hardly match her old image of the dark slayer with the one that currently greeted her. &quot;Thanks!&quot; exclaimed the brunette, as she took the bag and excitedly glanced inside. &quot;Whoa, you remembered!&quot; she said to Tara, who merely smiled at her sister's glee. She pulled out a copy of her favorite magazine, &quot;The Advocate,&quot; plus several books- a couple by Mercedes Lackey, a Star Trek novel, <u>Venus Envy </u>by Rita Mae Brown, and a volume of Pablo Neruda poetry. &quot;Thank you, so much, Willow,&quot; she said after looking at all the books.</p>

<p>The hacker merely smiled broadly at the use of her name, and shrugged. &quot;You're welcome. Ready, Tara?&quot; she asked her girlfriend.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. You gonna be okay now?&quot; Faith nodded, her nose already buried in a book. Tara shook her head, smiling, and let herself be led from the room.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Once they arrived at Giles' house, they found that the Watcher had already cleared out the closet and dresser in Faith's new room. He quietly disappeared as soon as they'd come in the door, and both just shrugged. He was probably uncomfortable with the idea of letting someone who'd tried to kill him stay in his house.</p>

<p>Willow snipped the tags from the clothes they'd bought for Faith- blue jeans, tee shirts, a couple of UCS sweatshirts, underwear, socks, pajamas, and sneakers, plus a leather jacket Tara meant to surprise her sister with. She put all but one outfit away in the dresser, and folded the remaining clothes into a neat pile to bring to the hospital later. Tara took the three boxes of personal possessions she'd brought with her cross-country and unpacked them. A few posters came from the boxes. One was of the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; crew. Another was for the Indigo Girls, while the last one was a &quot;Bound&quot; movie poster. Then she took out a small stereo system from the boxes, and a mixed collection of tapes and compact discs. One box was all books, and Tara quickly shelved them on the small set of bookshelves Giles had cleared off for Faith. The last few things that Tara unpacked were small personal things. A few framed pictures, a small jewelry box, and a small carved wooden chest, complete with lock, that she set next to the bed.</p>

<p>The pictures she set on the top of the bookshelf, which was at a little below shoulder height. One was a family portrait, with a small Tara and Faith sitting in front of Tara's grandmother and mother. One was of the two half-sisters not too long before Faith became a slayer. Faith was slight, and seemingly frail, while Tara was not too much taller than her sister and just filling out under the influences of puberty. They had their arms around each other and smiled towards the camera. The contrast of Faith's dark hair with Tara's was visually captivating, while their similar expressions marked them as siblings. Another was apparently a copy of a yearbook picture. Faith was in the midst of a small group of teenagers. In the front of the group a very flamboyantly dressed young man held a sign saying &quot;Green Street Middle School Gay/Straight Alliance.&quot; The last picture was a snapshot in a cheap plastic frame. Tara debated putting it up, then decided and set it in the center of the small display. She remembered taking the picture. Faith stood, defiant and proud, next to a small, plain woman in the female version of Giles' old tweed ensembles.</p>

<p>Willow stood behind her girlfriend, finished with her part of the job, and slipped her arms around Tara gently. &quot;Is that Gwen?&quot; she asked softly, as Tara stared at the picture.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. I took this picture a few weeks after she arrived,&quot; replied the blonde quietly. &quot;We both still miss her. She made life seem so... wonderful for a pair of poor Boston orphans. Like we were worth something. Faith was the Slayer, and I was her own expert on the occult. We'd keep each other alive and save the world.&quot; She shook her head.</p>

<p>&quot;Which is what you're doing, and have been doing for a long while,&quot; Willow said assuredly.</p>

<p>Tara laughed gently. &quot;You are so amazing,&quot; she remarked, turning in her girlfriend's embrace. Wrapping her arms around the hacker, she kissed Willow deeply, swallowing the moans the redhead voiced. When she couldn't breathe, she broke the kiss, but rested her forehead against Willow's.</p>

<p>&quot;Whoa,&quot; said the hacker, out of breath.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; grinned the wiccan. &quot;C'mon, I promised my little sister I'd go visit her later. And before that, missy, I intend to take you out to dinner.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think I can handle that,&quot; replied Willow, smiling as they twined hands and walked out of the house.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Reading intently, Faith found herself caught up in the books her sister's girlfriend had brought her. She still couldn't believe Tara had ended up with Willow, but didn't question it, knowing how good a fit the pair were. She just thanked whatever gods were listening that the redhead had forgiven her. The dark slayer felt the best she had in over two years, as good as she'd felt when Gwen was still alive and she felt that she was making a difference in the world.</p>

<p>A cough from the other end of the room distracted her. Looking up from her book, she caught sight of Buffy leaning against the door frame. &quot;B,&quot; she said quietly, a little startled.</p>

<p>&quot;Faith,&quot; replied the other slayer. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not quite five by five, but pretty good for eight months in a coma,&quot; answered the dark slayer casually, surprised when Buffy flinched at the mention of the coma. &quot;Look, B, I just... I want to thank you for getting my sister and Willow together. It means a lot to me that Tara's happy, and Red is a great girl.&quot; She rushed the statement out, slightly embarrassed. Shrugging, she added, &quot;And I want to apologize for everything I put you through.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy left the doorway and flopped down into the chair beside Faith's bed. &quot;Hey, Willow's happy, and that's all that really matters. Plus, I like your sister. She's a good person.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My exact opposite, huh?&quot; asked Faith wryly.</p>

<p>The blond slayer tilted her head and regarded her once-friend, once-enemy. &quot;No, not opposite at all. We all made mistakes back then, and we both need to apologize for stuff that happened then. Tara... filled us in on when you both were younger, and it made a lot of your actions make sense.&quot; She stopped talking at the younger slayer's cringe. &quot;Hey, now you had a rough life, and you're a very strong person to have survived and prospered under those kinds of conditions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't prosper. I was a prostitute and a drug dealer and a junkie,&quot; said Faith softly. &quot;Don't sugar coat stuff, B. I prefer you just be honest.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am being honest,&quot; replied Buffy gently. &quot;You are a strong, good, kind person. Even I could tell that when you first came to Sunnydale. Under that gruff dangerous exterior was this very kindhearted girl screaming to get out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You've been talking to my sister too much,&quot; said Faith uncomfortably.</p>

<p>&quot;So? She knows you like none of us do. I hope that changes, because as much as I like the Faith I knew, I think I'd like the Faith she knew just as much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Buffy, you guys are way too good to me. I don't deserve it.&quot;</p>

<p>The blond slayer smiled, &quot;You used my whole name! I always knew you could! And yes, you deserve it. I told you, I made mistakes just like you did. If I hadn't been so quick to judge you, or push you away when things got rough...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let's can the mutual guilt thing, okay, B?&quot; pleaded Faith softly. &quot;It's more than I can take.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; laughed Buffy softly. &quot;So what are you reading?&quot; she asked, steering the conversation away from the past.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, just some books Red brought me. Tar must've filled her in on my reading habits,&quot; Faith said sheepishly, holding up the books for her fellow slayer to see. Buffy raised her eyebrows at the eclectic collection. She picked up the magazine, and briefly flipped through it.</p>

<p>&quot;You know, Tara mentioned to Willow that you're gay. I kinda overheard, slayer hearing and all. I'm just wondering... um... why you never mentioned it. I mean, you could have told us, and it wouldn't have mattered. Instead, you were all guy-crazy and slept with Xander and everything.&quot;</p>

<p>Faith smiled gently, &quot;It was kind of awkward, I guess. I mean, I was in my school Gay/Straight Alliance and everything, had a couple of girlfriends, but the only person I cared about that really knew was my sister. Not even our grandmother or Tara's mom or my Watcher ever knew. My friends at school were all in the GSA. I just wasn't used to people knowing.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;And it never came up. Xander was a fluke, I guess. I'll try and apologize to him.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy laughed, &quot;I doubt Anya will let him get anywhere near you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anya?&quot; asked Faith, confused, &quot;You mean that ex-vengeance demon that went to high school with you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, her. They're joined at the hip and a few other places if you get my drift.&quot;</p>

<p>Faith howled with laughter. &quot;I get your drift, B.&quot; She calmed down, &quot;So what's new in your life? Got any hot guy foaming at the mouth for ya? According to my sister, Angel's out of the picture.&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy shrugged, &quot;I'm seeing this guy, Riley. He's part of this silly Government demon hunting group. I thought when I started to go out with him that I'd finally hooked a normal guy, but he's all into the covert demony stuff. And he's so... well, you know about chemistry, I'm assuming. We have none. It's like white bread versus cinnamon raisin bread. He's all Wonderbread and I'd like a little bit more in that department.&quot; She happily slipped back into her friendship with the younger slayer, sharing her problems and feelings easily.</p>

<p>&quot;Geez, that sucks, B.&quot; A slightly naughty grin laced her features, &quot;Ever thought of giving the fairer sex a shot?&quot;</p>

<p>Buffy looked at the other slayer in surprise, &quot;Well, not really,&quot; she answered honestly. &quot;What's it like?&quot;</p>

<p>Faith grinned like a Cheshire cat. &quot;Well, the chemistry thing is a lot more intense. I went with a couple guys before I figured stuff out, and I can say from lots of experience in the quick fuck department, that guys have very little to offer in comparison. Even just kissing a girl is better than sleeping with a guy.&quot; Then she shrugged, &quot;But if you don't lean that way, I doubt it would be the same.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I guess it's something to think about. Between slaying and school and everything, I never really went for a 'let's figure out who Buffy Summers is' investigation. I just went for guys like the rest of the girls I knew.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Except for Willow,&quot; offered Faith.</p>

<p>&quot;That's a pretty recent development,&quot; Buffy argued. &quot;It was a bit of a surprise, but not much after we'd dealt with her doppelganger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, come on, B, you couldn't tell earlier than that?&quot; said Faith, who grinned widely. &quot;And can you honestly tell me you've never had feelings of lust towards a member of the same sex?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I couldn't tell, and yes I have, okay!&quot; replied Buffy hotly, glaring at the younger woman. She could remember in vivid detail dancing with the dark slayer at the Bronze, and could remember the semi-ancient feelings of lust that the dancing had caused in her. No one, especially not Buffy Summers, could deny that Faith Ross was a very sexy young woman.</p>

<p>&quot;No and yes what, Buffy?&quot; asked Willow from the doorway. The blonde slayer blushed while her dark counterpart giggled.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, Wills. Hey, Tara,&quot; replied the older slayer, rising from her chair. &quot;How's it going?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, not bad,&quot; replied Tara softly, &quot;We've set up your room, Faith, and we've brought you some clothes for tomorrow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cool!&quot; said the younger slayer, struggling to rise. Buffy immediately went to help, supporting the younger woman as she propped pillows up behind her for Faith to lean against.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, cool,&quot; echoed Tara, smiling, &quot;But remember, a week of bedrest before you try anything stupid. And at least a month before you can go slaying again. Doctor's orders, and you're going to follow them,&quot; she said firmly, in full older-sister mode.</p>

<p>Faith fake pouted, and crossed her arms over her chest, while her companions all laughed at her. &quot;Fine, laugh at me, laugh at the cripple, I can handle it,&quot; she said with a feigned indifference.</p>

<p>Tara smiled, and glanced at her watch. &quot;Okay, everyone, it's getting late, and if you want to go home tomorrow, sis, you'd better get some sleep.&quot; She shooed her friends from the room, and shot a look at the dark slayer as Faith slid under the covers and quickly faked sleep. &quot;Night, Faith, don't let the bed bugs bite,&quot; she said from the doorway.</p>

<p>&quot;Love you too, Tar,&quot; replied the younger woman.</p>

<p>&quot;Always,&quot; added Tara, before she left.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>At promptly 7:15, Faith was pestering the nurses and doctors to discharge her.</p>

<p>&quot;Look, young lady, you are under eighteen, and until your sister, who happens to be your guardian, gets here, I cannot release you!&quot; said an annoyed Dr. Bates.</p>

<p>&quot;So I guess it's a good thing I'm here,&quot; said Tara softly from the door.</p>

<p>Dr. Bates sighed in relief as he escaped his patient to collect the discharge papers Tara needed to sign. &quot;Yes, it is, Miss Ross,&quot; he said, rushing out of the room.</p>

<p>&quot;Stop giving the doctors trouble,&quot; scolded the wiccan. She went to the drawers in the hospital room and pulled out the clothing Willow had put away there the day before. &quot;Willow's out swiping a wheelchair to get you to the car with, and while she's doing that, I'm going to dress you, understand?&quot; Within a few scant minutes, Faith was dressed in a loose-fitting pair of blue jeans, a dark blue tee shirt, and a gray UCS sleeveless sweatshirt. Tara helped her sister comb snarled dark brown locks, and pull it back into a ponytail. With a pair of new socks and sneakers on her feet, Faith was itching to leave the hospital.</p>

<p>Willow finally arrived with a wheelchair and Dr. Bates with the discharge papers. Tara signed the paperwork quickly, then wheeled her sister from the hospital, intent not to let Faith wheel herself because she knew her little sister would attempt a few wheelies along the way.</p>

<p>&quot;I took Gwen's car,&quot; said Tara softly as they approached the parking lot. &quot;I don't think she'd mind, and I needed some way to get across country for college.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; said Faith soberly as they neared the Acura. &quot;At least she had a better car than G-Man. I couldn't imagine driving 3000 miles in that hunk of scrap metal.&quot; With a little cooperation, between the three of them they managed to get Faith in the front seat of the car. Willow slipped the wheelchair into the trunk, then climbed in the back seat as Tara started the vehicle. Soon they were pulling out into traffic, and Faith was rummaging through her sister's collection of tapes for something to listen to. Finally she pulled out one that seemed satisfactory, and popped it in the tape deck.</p>

<p>Willow was completely astounded as the two sisters began singing along to Peter Paul and Mary loudly.</p>

<p>As they arrived at Giles', they found the entire Scooby gang in attendance. Buffy came out to the car and personally settled the dark slayer into the wheelchair. Once inside, Giles insisted on an official Scooby meeting. Together, the group caught Faith up on eight months' worth of supernatural events, glossing over much of the Mayor's Ascension and the events surrounding it. When Faith started to tire, Tara insisted they show her to her room, and let her sleep. The blond wiccan had a whole set of medications that Faith needed to take, and was quite firm in dealing with her sister. Faith meekly submitted, and seemed awestruck to see all her old things put up in Giles' spare room. Overwhelmed, she quickly fell asleep after asserting that she could change herself into her pajamas. Tara crept in after she heard snores issuing from the room, and tucked the younger girl in calmly.</p>

<p>She returned to the living room, only to find that Xander and Anya had already left, while Buffy was quietly brooding in the corner and Willow was helping to clean up in the kitchen with Giles. &quot;Meeting dismissed?&quot; she asked the blond slayer gently.</p>

<p>Buffy shook herself from her thoughts, and smiled at the wiccan, &quot;Yeah, pretty much. Anya was getting horny and with Faith asleep, there really isn't any point to continuing. You and Willow gonna disappear soon?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Probably should ask her,&quot; said Tara, blushing a little. &quot;But most likely yeah. What about you?&quot;</p>

<p>The slayer shrugged, &quot;I'll run a quick patrol, then head home.&quot; She rose to her feet, and patted Tara's shoulder. &quot;Have a good night, Tara,&quot; she said, then went to say good bye to Willow and Giles before leaving. When the door had closed behind her, Willow came from the kitchen. &quot;It's all cleaned up,&quot; she announced to no one in particular.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey,&quot; said Tara softly, turning to face her girlfriend. &quot;Want to head over to my place?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>Willow's face brightened considerably. &quot;Sure, let's just say goodnight to Giles.&quot;</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>&quot;Faith seems to be adjusting okay,&quot; remarked the hacker conversationally as she pulled on her pajamas.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, she is, I think.&quot; Tara didn't even bother to look up from her book as Willow slipped into bed beside her. The wiccan set her book down, and looked carefully at her girlfriend. &quot;How about you and the rest of the Scoobs? It must be weird having her back around, especially knowing what you do now.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow smiled. &quot;Well, the Faith we've got now isn't really the Faith we used to know. She isn't homicidal, and she isn't all dark and dangerous. She's just Faith Ross- and it's so weird knowing her last name! Now it seems like she's really a part of the group, and I think we have you to thank for it. If you hadn't been there, she'd probably be chained up in Giles' basement as we tried to figure out what to do with her.&quot;</p>

<p>Tara studied her hands for a long moment. &quot;She's my sister, and I can keep her in line, most of the time. I don't know, I think she was pretty steeped in regret when she woke up. And you guys were quick to forgive. I think you might have chained her up for a little while, then slowly accepted her again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I guess it doesn't really matter. What matters is that she's doing well, and she's got her family. And you're happier than I've ever seen you. I'd call that a good thing.&quot; Willow touched Tara's face gently. She lightly pulled Tara around to face her, and slowly kissed the wiccan.</p>

<p>Tara slid her arms around the hacker, pulling Willow closer until there wasn't even room for air between them. &quot;I love you, Willow Rosenberg,&quot; she said softly after they'd parted the kiss.</p>

<p>&quot;I love you, too, Tara Ross,&quot; replied the redhead. &quot;Now, I'm getting sleepy. How about you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know,&quot; said Tara, grinning seductively. &quot;I'm feeling a little energized myself.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow laughed, &quot;Then how about some cuddling?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sounds great,&quot; replied Tara, settling down under the covers and snuggling close to Willow. She turned off the lamp, and let the room grow dark. When they were both comfortably settled, she asked, &quot;So what do you think?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of what?&quot; replied Willow sleepily.</p>

<p>&quot;Of the other side of me, the stuff you didn't know beforehand,&quot; answered Tara quietly.</p>

<p>Willow pressed a gentle kiss on the blonde's forehead. &quot;I love every part of you, Tara. And I'm so proud of you for surviving against those odds.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I saw my sister's Watcher be murdered in front of me, Wills, I don't think that's brave.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Keeping going after that, though, and coming here to find Faith, earning a scholarship, standing up to us when we were angry at your sister, that takes bravery, love.&quot; Willow tightened her hold on her girlfriend. &quot;And don't argue with me,&quot; she murmured, &quot;because I think your sister and all our friends would agree.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Crud,&quot; muttered Tara softly, &quot;you're going to give me an egogasm.&quot;</p>

<p>A certain redheaded hacker's howls of laughter woke up half the dorm and one very indignant kitten. It was only the kitten, however, that received any sort of apology, namely in the form of a belly scritch and a pinch of catnip from her mommies.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>A month later, Faith Ross went on her first patrol in almost eleven months. The Chosen Two inspected three cemeteries and went for a quick sweep of the college campus. Behind the athletics field, they found several vamps hanging out together.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, boys,&quot; said one of the slayers, flipping a stake up and down nonchalantly while her companion circled around the group.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, who are you little girl?&quot; asked one of the undead nasties.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm the Slayer,&quot; replied Faith, smirking.</p>

<p>&quot;Nah, the Slayer is a blond chick, sweetie. So why don't you come here and be my midnight snack.&quot; The vamp morphed into gameface and charged.</p>

<p>With a few quick moves, he was dust, and the rest of the vamps stood wide-eyed as Buffy made her charge from the rear. Soon, there were several piles of dust, and the two Slayers high-fived.</p>

<p>&quot;Nice slayage,&quot; remarked Buffy.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks, B. So, you hungry or horny?&quot; replied Faith, still smirking.</p>

<p>&quot;Horny, I think. And I've been thinking, too,&quot; said Buffy as they fell in side by side on their walk back to their Watcher's house.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, what about?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;About what you said in the hospital, about giving the fairer sex a shot. You remember I broke it off with Riley a few weeks ago?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I do. Who've you got your eye on now, B?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You,&quot; replied Buffy simply.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Buffy, I never thought you'd get my drift,&quot; said Faith softly, stopping in her tracks to turn to the other half of the Chosen Two.</p>

<p>&quot;You said my whole name!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I always say full names when I'm being serious,&quot; remarked Faith as she slowly stepped into the blond slayer's personal space.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, really,&quot; said Buffy, hesitantly sliding her arms around her dark counterpart. &quot;Well, that's good to know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I guess it is,&quot; replied Faith, her breath turning short and ragged.</p>

<p>&quot;It is,&quot; said Buffy simply, then she leant closer and bridged the final gap between them. Slowly, she moved to meet Faith's lips with her own, and the Chosen Two gently kissed. It was gentle, and tender, and they both moaned at the intensity of it. After they separated, they continued in their embrace. Finally, Buffy broke the silence. &quot;So, should I talk to your sister about asking you out?&quot;</p>

<p>Faith groaned, &quot;Oh, god!&quot; and then dissolved into giggles. Pulling the other slayer close, she rested her head on Buffy's shoulder and shook with laughter. &quot;I guess that might be a good idea,&quot; she said smirking, &quot;or else she probably won't let me out of the house!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tara's so cruel,&quot; mocked Buffy. &quot;She never lets you do anything but study for the GED and slay otherworldly menaces.&quot;</p>

<p>Faith pouted, then laughed. &quot;Well, at least she likes you. She hated my last girlfriend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And why was that?&quot; asked Buffy, smiling.</p>

<p>&quot;Because my last girlfriend was too old for me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And how old was your last girlfriend, though I'm truly afraid to know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, only twenty, but I was fifteen at the time. And she was a slut. She hit on Tara, while we were going out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I'm only a year and a half older than you. That should mean something. I'm also not about to hit on Tara.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you have it in with my sister's girlfriend. That's worth some brownie points for sure,&quot; smirked Faith.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess my best friend and I find you Ross girls irresistible,&quot; said Buffy, smiling. &quot;C'mon, let's go report to Giles, and then I'm taking you out to dinner and a movie.&quot; She took Faith's hands in her own, and the Chosen Two headed to their Watcher.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>Tara and Willow were trying to study. Finals were coming up soon, and both had lots of work to do. Miss Kitty Fantastico, who had been renamed Blazer the week beforehand, sensed her mommies' tension and started to perform feats of kitty acrobatics for their entertainment. The couple laughed softly as Blazer practically flipped to bat at a flying insect.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm worried about her,&quot; said Tara finally. &quot;It's been a long time since she's patrolled, and I'm used to going with her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's with Buffy,&quot; replied Willow, nonplussed. &quot;They'll keep each other safe. They're friends.&quot;</p>

<p>Tara smiled at that statement, &quot;You're right. And who knows? I think they'd like to be more than friends.&quot;</p>

<p>Willow started for a second, then nodded, &quot;You know, you're right. I thought that a long time ago. They've always had some kind of...&quot; she fumbled for the word.</p>

<p>&quot;Chemistry?&quot; offered her girlfriend. &quot;Yeah, they're a pretty potent mix, and in a strange way well suited to each other.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They balance one another,&quot; stated Willow. They studied each other carefully, then both nodded and turned back to their books.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Willow asked, &quot;What about us?&quot;</p>

<p>Tara seemed to study on that question for a moment. &quot;I think we complement each other more than we balance each other.&quot; She smiled, rose from her chair, and sat down next to her girlfriend. &quot;But who really cares?&quot; she asked before kissing the hacker.</p>

<p>&quot;Not me, for sure,&quot; replied Willow few minutes later. &quot;Come on, I can't concentrate anyway. Let's go for a walk.&quot;</p>

<p>They made their way around campus, stakes, crosses, and holy water tucked into their jacket pockets. On the edge of the athletics field, they came across a fight between the Slayers and a few measly vampires. Willow pulled her girlfriend into the shadows of the sports shed to hide. They watched as the Chosen Two quickly dispatched the evil undead, then something made them hold back as Buffy and Faith started towards them. The Slayers walked for a short period of time, then stopped. Neither wiccan nor hacker could hear what they said, but they watched curiously as the pair spoke, then moved closer and kissed. Glancing at each other, they giggled soundlessly and slipped away.</p>

<p>Once out of the range of slayer hearing, they laughed openly. &quot;I guess that answers that question, love,&quot; said Willow between giggles.</p>

<p>&quot;It sure does,&quot; replied Tara. &quot;And it gives me an idea.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh?&quot; Willow smirked, sliding towards the blonde.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; breathed Tara, moving her arms until she had Willow in a close embrace. She planted feather-light kisses on her girlfriend's cheeks, forehead, eyelids, and nose, then brushed her lips to the hacker's.</p>

<p>Willow growled deep in her throat, and threaded delicate hands through fine blond hair, and pulled Tara to her. Bathed in moonlight, she kissed the wiccan passionately, until she felt Tara go weak at the knees.</p>

<p>&quot;Home, now,&quot; panted Tara when she could catch her breath. Willow merely grinned and lead her soon-to-be lover back to the dorms.</p>

<hr size=2 width=400 color=#669966>

<p>She's so beautiful when she sleeps. The sun hits her hair and makes it flame. Of course, she's always beautiful. Last night we became lovers. She was the first time that every girl dreams of- passionate, gentle, caring, and full of life. My world is perfect. I have my sister back, I have the most wonderful lover, a group of amazing friends, things that when I first came to Sunnydale I couldn't even imagine.</p>

<p>She's starting to wake up. And she's smiling, tightening her grip on me. Our bodies are tangled together, skin on skin, and her head rests on my shoulder. She moves and whispers something unintelligible, and then kisses my neck. Goddess, I don't deserve her. She's so beautiful. She's so wonderful. She's seen the other side of me, heard about my past, accepted me scars, failures, and all. She's everything to me. She's my love, my Willow.</p>

<p>And as the morning sun bathes us with its golden light, she rises up to kiss me and we make love again.</p>
