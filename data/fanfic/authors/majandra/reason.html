<!-- The Reason \ Story -->

<p>"Do you want to know the real reason I'm so dead set against you and
Mike McQueen being together?" Sam demanded, getting a little red in
the face. Jane nodded, to angry to even talk. The fight had been
going on for about half an hour now. Jane wanted the two of them to
move in to the McQueen house. Sam emphatically did not. And until
now she had never given a satisfactory reason. </p>

<p>"Go on then. Give me one good reason I shouldn't just exert my
parental authority and force you to move."</p>

<p>"It's a bit of a long explanation," Sam said quietly, calming down. </p>

<p>"I'm listening."</p>

<p>"Mom, I'm a lesbian. There, I said it. I've been wanting to tell you
for some time now, but there just never seemed to be a good time."</p>

<p>"What's that got to do with moving in with Mike and Brooke?"</p>

<p>"Everything. Do you want to know what led me to realize I'm gay?
I'll tell you that, if you want. It was my long standing crush on
Brooke McQueen."</p>

<p>Jane's face settled itself into an expression of understanding. "So
you think, if you're forced to live in close quarters with her,
she'll find out?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. And I'm not ready for that yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, baby, how could she find out? I know you won't tell her, and
I'm damn sure I'm not going to abuse your trust by telling her.
You've got nothing to worry about."</p>

<p>"If you promise me that this isn't going to become an issue, I'll
agree to move in on one condition."</p>

<p>"Shoot."</p>

<p>"Please don't make me share a bedroom with her!"</p>

<p>Jane just laughed. </p>

<p>Moving day came and went and after about a month things were
starting to settle down at the newly christened Palace, or McQueen-
McPherson residence. Sam had got her wish and was not made to share
a bedroom with Brooke, merely a bathroom. Which, now that Sam
thought about it, was just as bad. Because every time Brooke went to
take a shower, Sam couldn't help but wonder what she looked like,
naked. And every time Sam passed Brooke in the hallway, it was
taking all her self control not grab the unsuspecting blonde and
kiss her senseless. She confided in Jane more and more. </p>

<p>"Mom, I swear, she must have found out and is now driving me crazy
on purpose! God, I mean, she leaves the shower door wide open, AND
the curtain, and am I expected to just not look? I can't deal with
this, honestly!"</p>

<p>Jane smiled slightly. "The only solution I can see is me talking to
Mike about it. If it's done tactfully, he can talk to Brooke about
her, uh, lack of modesty without ever mentioning your name."</p>

<p>"But he's going to have to know about my crush on her, isn't he."</p>

<p>"Well, Sam, it's only fair. He is her father, after all."</p>

<p>Sam heaved a sigh and thought deeply. After a minute or so, she
looked at her mother. "All right, tell him, but I want to be there."</p>

<p>Mike was kind, caring, understanding, and everything Sam had
expected him NOT to be. All he said was he would talk to Brooke, and
he said he wouldn't mention the crush. Sam was left feeling a little
better. Oh God, was that Brooke taking ANOTHER shower?</p>

<p>"Brookie? Baby, I have to talk to you," Mike called from the outside
of the bathroom. </p>

<p>"Then come in, Daddy, I'm not ready to get out of the shower yet,"
she called back. Mike sighed and went in. </p>

<p>"That's what we need to talk about. Brooke, did you know Sam is a
lesbian?" He justified this remark by telling himself he'd only
promised to keep quiet about the crush, not about the homosexuality.
Besides, he couldn't think of a better way to get through to Brooke. </p>

<p>"What? No, I didn't know that," Brooke whispered. </p>

<p>"The thing is, babe, is she's getting a little uncomfortable with
the displays you've been putting on. I know that's how we're used to
living, but you're going to have to tone it down a bit."</p>

<p>"Why would seeing me naked make her uncomfortable? If anything, she
should be happy, right? If she's a lesbian, she's probably enjoying
it, right?"</p>

<p>Mike held his head in his hands. He loved his daughter, but there
was just no mistaking the fact that she was a natural blonde. </p>

<p>"Brooke, Sam has the hots for you. Okay? So stop parading around
naked in front of her, because it just isn't fair for her to have to
see something she wants to bad, but can never have. All right?"</p>

<p>Brooke smiled to herself as her father left. "But who said she
couldn't have me?"</p>

<p>Sam sat in her room and tried not to think about naked Brooke. </p>

<p>&lt;Okay, Sammy, think about other things. Newspapers. Articles.
Harrison's goofy notes. Brooke naked. Argh! Think unsexy thoughts!
Think unsexy thoughts! Baseball! Mom and Mike getting it on! Me and
Harrison getting it on! Oh, God, help me!&gt;</p>

<p>There came a knock at the door and Brooke entered, wearing nothing
but a robe. Sam licked her lips nervously and continued her train of
unsexy thoughts. </p>

<p>&lt;She's in my room, almost naked! Uh, music! Schoolwork! She's
walking towards me! Grass growing! Cars! Lily's activism!&gt;</p>

<p>"Sam? Is it true, what I heard?"</p>

<p>"What did you hear?" &lt;Warm milk! Raindrops on roses! Whiskers on
kittens!&gt;</p>

<p>"I heard you have a thing for me, and I was wondering, if it is
indeed true, if you'd like to kiss me."</p>

<p>&lt;AAARRRGGGHHH!!!!! BIO GLASS NAKED ON A COLD DAY!!!!! BIO GLASS
NAKED ON A COLD DAY!!!!!&gt;</p>

<p>"What makes you think that I have a thing for you?"</p>

<p>"Come on, Sam, I'm not stupid. I've seen the way you look at me, and
I bet if I dropped this robe right now, you'd start to salivate and
babble like an idiot, am I right?" She hadn't given away her
sources, so the family dynamic was safe. For the time being. </p>

<p>"I, I, I, uh, don't have, a, you know, a thing for you. Totally no.
I, uh, I, I don't even like you. Yeah, that's right, I hate you."</p>

<p>Brooke just smiled and dropped her robe. </p>

<p>&lt;SHE'S NAKED IN FRONT OF ME!!!!! AAARRRGGGHHH!!!!!&gt;</p>

<p>Brooke leaned in and kissed Sam gently. Sam was burbling too hard to
respond, so she pulled back and silenced her with a finger pressed
to her lips. "It's okay if you want me, Sam," she reassured the
panicking brunette. "Cos I want you too."</p>

<p>Something inside Sam snapped and she grabbed Brooke around the waist
and pulled her close, kissing her with a passion she never even knew
she possessed. Brooke responded enthusiastically, running her hands
all over Sam's body, undressing her. Sam wasn't sure what to do with
her hands, so Brooke took hold of them and placed them on her
breasts, where Sam's instincts took over and began to knead them,
her thumbs flicking the nipples gently, forcing a moan out of the
naked blonde. Brooke sucked on Sam's tongue as she removed the last
of the brunette's clothing and pushed her down onto the bed. </p>

<p>"So, what happens now?" Sam panted, unable to take her eyes off of
Brooke's body. Brooke smiled. </p>

<p>"Now, I tell you how absolutely incredible you are and how perfect
your body is. Then I kiss you once," she kissed Sam gently on the
mouth, "and then, I do this."</p>

<p>She bent down and took one of Sam's nipples in her mouth, causing
Sam to gasp and arch almost off the bed. "OhGodOhGodOhGodOhGod
Brooke!!!" she panted, not wanting to cry out in case she drew the
attention of the parentals. Brooke smiled evilly and plotted. By the
time this was over, she was going to make Sam scream. No matter what
it took. </p>

<p>The thing was, was that Brooke knew something Sam didn't, and that
was the fact that Brooke had sprung a surprise on the parentals the
day before. A night at the ritziest hotel in the area, and Mike and
Jane were only too happy to accept. So, there was really no need to
be quiet. And Brooke didn't intend to let Sam be quiet. </p>

<p>Kissing her way down Sam's torso quickly, she settled her head
between Sam's legs and began to kiss her thighs. Sam was quivering
with need by the time Brooke finally placed a finger on her lower
lips and started stroking, feather light touches that drove Sam mad.
On ever up stroke, Brooke made sure to brush Sam's clit. On every
down stroke, she blew gently on it, and after about ten seconds of
this Sam was moaning in pleasure that bordered on pain, wanting so
badly for Brooke to stop teasing her. </p>

<p>Brooke couldn't stop smiling evilly. Oh, boy, was she bad, and she
knew it too. She pushed just the tip of her finger inside Sam, ever
so slowly. Sam arched off the bed and Brooke stopped completely. The
brunette cried out softly, wanting Brooke to continue. </p>

<p>"If you don't move, I'll keep going. Agreed?"</p>

<p>Sam nodded her head wordlessly, her eyes black with desire and her
entire body bathed in a thin sheen of sweat. Brooke resumed what she
had been doing, pushing her finger in, a tiny bit at a time, blowing
on Sam's clit the whole time. Then, without warning, she pushed the
rest in fast, and added another finger before Sam could realize what
was happening. Sam cried out, a little louder this time. But Brooke
wasn't finished with her. She curled her fingers upwards, hitting
that spot she knew would make Sam scream. And it worked. </p>

<p>Sam came with such an earsplitting shriek that Brooke was surprised
the neighbors didn't call the police. She nibbled gently on Sam's
clit as she came back to earth then moved up to kiss the shaking
brunette. </p>

<p>"So, you don't have a thing for me, right?"</p>

<p>"Nope, I don't have a thing for you," Sam panted when she was able
to speak. "I"m in love with you."</p>

<p>The girls lay there for a while, Brooke holding Sam and feeling her
heartbeat go back to normal. Then she saw Sam smile. </p>

<p>"My turn?"</p>
