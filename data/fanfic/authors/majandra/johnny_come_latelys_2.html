<!-- Johnny Come Latelys \ Epilogue -->

<p>Aaran and Anya are still at Kennedy. Anya had the good grace to step
back, away from Sam. She knew she lost that day. The latest on Anya
is she has started a tentative relationship with Nicole. </p>

<p>Aaran never stopped lusting after Lily, but when it became apparent
that Carmen had a thing for him, Lily refused to break the Best
Friends Code and pursue him. Eventually Carmen gave the go ahead.
Aaran and Lily hooked up and have been together ever since. They are
firm friends with Carmen still, and, almost unbelievably, through
Aaran, Anya brought Nicole into the group. She had turned over a new
leaf and is being nice... for now. </p>

<p>And Brooke and Sam? They recently celebrated MacKenzie's first
birthday, and their own six month anniversary. As an anniversary
present Brooke bought Sam a birthstone ring - not a cheap one,
either. Sam gave Brooke a set of photo albums, already thoughtfully
filled with meaningful photos dating back to kindergarten, when they
first met. The two have tentative plans to move out of the Palace
and into an apartment together after graduation. </p>
